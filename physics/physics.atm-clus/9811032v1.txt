ABSTRACT

Symmetry adaptation techniques are applied to the determination of the inten-
sity of two-photon transitions for transition ions in ﬁnite symmetry environments.
We treat the case of intra-conﬁgurational transitions with some details and brieﬂy
report some results on inter-conﬁgurational transitions. In particular, for intra-
conﬁgurational transitions, we describe a model which takes into account the fol-
lowing ingredients : (symmetry, second- plus third-order mechanisms, S-, L- and
J-mixings).

ABSTRACT
Symmetry adaptation techniques are applied to the determination
of the intensity of two-photon (intra- and inter-conﬁgurational)
transitions for transition ions in ﬁnite symmetry environments.

1. INTRODUCTION

⊃

Symmetry adaptation techniques, developed in the spirit of Refs. [1,2], for a
chain of groups O(3)
G are applied here to two-photon spectroscopy of transition
ions of conﬁguration nℓN (ℓ = d for transition metal ions and ℓ = f for lanthanide
or actinide ions) in surroundings of ﬁnite symmetry G. More precisely, we show in
this lecture how Wigner-Racah calculus for a chain O(3)
G (in terms of simple
or double groups) can be combined with models3−20) based on second- plus third-
order mechanisms in order to isolate the polarization dependence from the intensity
of two-photon transitions for an nℓN ion in a molecular or solid-state environment
with symmetry G. (For classiﬁcation and symmetry-breaking purposes, the group
G may be replaced by a chain of subgroups of O(3), the relevant symmetry group
being one of the groups of the chain.)

⊃

The rˆole of symmetries in two-photon spectroscopy of partly-ﬁlled shell ions
in ﬁnite symmetry is touched upon in Refs. [4-6,12-14,16,17]. In Refs. [4,5], the
information arising from symmetry is handled mainly in a qualitative way. More
quantitative results can be found in Refs. [6,12-14,16,17]. In Ref. [12], the accent is
put on the transition matrix elements between initial and ﬁnal state vectors while
emphasis is on the intensity strength in Refs. [14,16] and in the present lecture.
This lecture constitutes a complement to the material presented in Refs. [14,16].

The two summations in (1) have to be extended over all the intermediate states

sign of ¯hω2 has to be changed.) The quantity ~D. ~
Eλ in (1) stands for the scalar
product of the electric dipolar moment operator ~D for the N electrons and the
unit polarization vector ~
Eλ for the photon no. λ. (We use single-mode excitations,
of energy ¯hωλ, wave-vector ~kλ and polarization ~
Eλ, for the radiation ﬁeld.) The

In equations (2) and (3), we use the components (

polarization, the angles (θλ, ϕλ) are the polar angles of the polarization vector ~

only one sum occurs in (1) when the two photons are identical.

Equation (1) can be derived from the time-dependent perturbation theory
and goes back to the work of G¨oppert-Mayer18,19) (see the lecture by J.C. Gˆacon
in these proceedings). It is also possible to derive it, in an elegant way, from the
method of the resolvent operator20).
2.2. State vectors

The initial state i with symmetry Γ is characterized by the state vectors

iΓγ)
where γ (γ = 1, 2,
, dim Γ) is a multiplicity label to be used if the dimension
dim Γ of the irreducible representation class (IRC) Γ of the group G is greater
than 1. The state vector

(cid:17)

In equation (8), W(kS kL)k is an electronic double tensor of spin rank kS, orbital
rank kL and total rank k. The information on the polarization of the two photons
(k) of rank k = 0, 1 or 2. The right-
is contained in the tensor product
{E1 E2}
hand side of (8) is a development in terms of scalar products ( . ) with expansion
coeﬃcients C [(kSkL) k]. These coeﬃcients depend on the ground conﬁguration
+1nℓN+1, with ℓ + ℓ′ odd,
nℓN and on the conﬁgurations nℓN−1n′ℓ′ and/or n′ℓ′4ℓ
from which the states v arise.

′

Only the contributions (kS = 0, kL = 1, k = 1) and (kS = 0, kL = 2, k =
2) correspond to the standard theory originally developed by Axe3). The other
contributions (kS 6
= 0, kL, k), which may include (kS = 1, kL = 1, k = 0) and
(kS = 1, kL = 1, k = 2), correspond either to mechanisms introduced by various
authors7−11) or to phenomenological contributions12). The contributions (kS =
0, kL = k, k) and (kS 6
= 0, kL, k) are often referred to as second-order and third-
order mechanisms, respectively. It is in principle possible to ﬁnd an expression for
the parameters C [(kSkL) k]. Among the various contributions (kS 6
= 0, kL, k), the
contribution (kS = 1, kL = 1, k = 0) arises from the spin-orbit interaction within
the conﬁguration nℓN−1n′ℓ′ as was shown for lanthanide ions7,8).

2.4. Intensity formula

The quantity of interest for a comparison between theory and experiment is
the intensity Si(Γ)→f (Γ′) of the two-photon transition between the initial state i
and the ﬁnal state f . This intensity is given by

Property 1. In the general case, we have the (hermitean) property

I[ℓksrΓ′′; ΓΓ′]∗ = I[kℓrsΓ′′; ΓΓ′]

(14)

which ensures that SΓ→Γ′ is a real quantity.

Property 2. In the case where the group G is multiplicity-free, we have the

factorization formula

I[kℓrsΓ′′; ΓΓ′] = χ[krΓ′′; ΓΓ′] χ[ℓsΓ′′; ΓΓ′]∗

The number of independent parameters I in the expansion (11) can be a
priori determined from the two following selection rules used in conjunction with

2.6. Discussion

For most of the cases of interest, there is no summation on r and s, two
branching multiplicity labels of type a, in the intensity formula (11). (In other
words, the frequency of Γ′′ in (kg) and (ℓg) is rarely greater than 1.) The group-
theoretical selection rules (16) impose strong limitations on the summation over
Γ′′ in (11) once Γ and Γ′ are ﬁxed and the range of values of k and ℓ is chosen.

The number of independent intensity parameters I in the formula (11) de-
pends on : (i) the nature of the photons, cf. Rule 2 ; (ii) the group G, cf. Rule
1 ; (iii) the conjugation property (14), cf. Property 1 ; (iv) the use of kS = 0
(second-order mechanisms) or kS = 0 and kS 6
= 0 (second- plus third-order mech-
anisms), cf. Rule 2 ; (v) the (weak-, intermediate- or strong-ﬁeld) state vectors
used in conjunction with equations (12) and (13).

Points (i)-(iii) depend on external physical conditions. On the other hand,
points (iv) and (v) are model-dependent. In particular, in the case where the J-
mixing, cf. point (v), can be neglected, a situation often of interest for lanthanide
ions, the summations on k and ℓ in (11) are further reduced by the triangular rule
J + J ′, where J and J ′ are the total angular quantum numbers
J

for the initial and ﬁnal states, respectively. Similar restrictions apply to kS and
kL in (13) if the S- and L-mixing are neglected.

The computation, via equations (12) and (13), of the I parameters generally
is a diﬃcult task. Therefore, they may be considered, at least in a ﬁrst step,
as phenomenological parameters. In this respect, equations (12) and (13) should
serve as a guide for reducing the number of I parameters.

Once the number of independent parameters I in the formula (11) has been
determined, we can obtain the polarization dependence of the intensity strength
a′′Γ′′γ′′ (with K = k, ℓ and a′′ =
SΓ→Γ′ by calculating the tensor products
r, s) occurring in (11). For this purpose, we use the development

As a pedagological example, let us consider the case of the two-photon ab-

We continue with a model characterized (in addition to the symmetry C4v or D2d)
by the use of second- plus third-order mechanisms. Thus, according to Rule 2, the
indices k, ℓ in (11) may assume the values 0 and 2. By introducing the abbreviation
I[kℓrsΓ′′ = A1; Γ = A1 Γ′ = A1], we are left with 3 a priori independent
I(kℓ)
parameters (cf. Property 1), viz., I(00), I(02) = I(20)∗ and I(22). Taking the
wave-vector ~k of the two photons parallel to the crystallographic c-axis, we have

In the intensity formula (19), the two ﬁrst terms (in r2 and s) arise from third-
order mechanisms while the third one (in t2) comes from second-order mechanisms.
Only the scalar term (in r2) contributes to SA1→A1 in the absence of J-mixing.

Equation (19) has been applied13) to the cases of Sm2+:BaClF, Sm2+:SrClF
and Eu3+:LuPO4. Neither the conventional second-order term (in t2) nor the
scalar third-order term (in r2) are suﬃcient to reproduce the experimental data.
Indeed, on the basis of ﬁtting procedures13), a good agreement between theory and
experiment requires in these cases that the three terms (in r2, t, and s2) contribute
to the intensity strength (19). As a conclusion, the model inherent to equation
(19), the ingredients of this model being : (symmetry, second- plus third-order
5D0 two-photon transition
mechanisms, J-mixing), is appropriate to the 7F0 →
for Sm2+:BaClF, Sm2+:SrClF and Eu3+:LuPO4.

Similar models have been applied to the two-photon transitions13) 7F0(Γ =

mechanisms are suﬃcient to describe the transitions. More precisely, the model :

3. INTER-CONFIGURATIONAL TWO-PHOTON TRANSITIONS
3.1. Sketch of the theory

We now consider two-photon transitions between Stark levels arising from the
conﬁgurations nℓN and nℓN−1n′ℓ′ of opposite parities (ℓ + ℓ′ odd). For the sake of
iΓγ)) and ﬁnal
simplicity, we deal here with identical photons. The initial (i.e.,
(i.e.,

f Γ′γ′)) state vectors are taken in the form

(20), as well as the intermediate state vectors, with state vectors of the type
nℓN−1n′ℓ′x′Γ′γ′) and
nℓN xΓγ), respectively. This may be achieved by using
|
ﬁrst-order time-independent perturbation theory where the polluting agent is the
crystal-ﬁeld potential H3 of odd order, which is static or dynamic according to as
the group G does not or does have a center of inversion. Hence, we produce state
nℓN−1n′ℓ′f Γ′γ′ > from which we can calculate,

E(nℓ) = 2 ¯h ω. We thus obtain a closed form formula
for Mi(Γγ)→f (Γ′γ′) (see Ref. [20]).

At this stage, it should be mentioned that the so-obtained formula is equiva-
lent to that we would obtain, within the just mentioned approximation, by using
third-order mechanisms described by

We have shown how O(3)

G symmetry adaptation allows to derive intensity
formulas for intra- and inter-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions for ions in
molecular or solid-state environments. In particular, the number of independent
parameters required for describing the polarization dependence of the transitions
is determined by an ensemble of properties and rules which combine symmetry
and physical considerations. The main results of this paper are formulas (11) and
(21) for intra- and inter-conﬁgurational transitions, respectively.

The polarization factors in (11) and (21) are under the control of the ex-
perimentalist. Both formulas depend on expansion coeﬃcients c(αSLJaΓ; i) and
c(α′S′L′J ′a′Γ′; f ). These coeﬃcients (model dependent) can be obtained by opti-
mizing Hamiltonians, for the ion in its environment, involving at least Coulomb,
spin-orbit and crystal-ﬁeld interactions ; the introduction of more sophisticated in-
teractions may be useful to take covalency eﬀects into account2). Alternatively, the
expansion coeﬃcients can be considered as free parameters. Furthermore, in (11)
and (21) we have reduced matrix elements (conﬁguration dependent), isoscalar fac-
tors for O(3)
G (group theory dependent), and C[(kSkL)k] parameters (mecha-
nisms dependent). As a conclusion, there are three ways to deal with the intensity

⊃

parameters in (11) and (21) : they can be calculated from ﬁrst principles, or
considered as phenomenological parameters or determined in a mixed approach.

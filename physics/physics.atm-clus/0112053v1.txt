We have investigated the lowest-energy structures and elec-
tronic properties of the Aun(n = 2 − 20) clusters using den-
sity functional calculations with local density approximation.
The small Au clusters adopt planar structures up to 6. Tab-
ular cage structures are preferred in the range of n = 10 − 14
and a structural transition from tabular cage-like structure to
compact near-spherical structure is found near n = 15. The
most stable conﬁgurations obtained for Au13 and Au19 clus-
ters are amorphous instead of icosahedral or fcc-like, while the
electronic density of states sensitively depend on the cluster
geometry. Dramatic odd-even alternative behaviors are ob-
tained in the relative stability, HOMO-LUMO gaps and ion-
ization potentials of gold clusters. The theoretical ionization
potentials of Aun clusters compare well with experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION

Gold clusters are currently attracting interest as
the building blocks of novel nanostructured materi-
als and devices.1–4 During the past two decades, the
structures of gold clusters have been studied both
experimentally5–10 and theoretically.11–22 Experiments
suggest that Aun nanoclusters with diameters of 1−2 nm
are amorphous.5,6 Some theoretical results from molec-
ular dynamics simulations or ﬁrst-principles calculations
also support this argument.16,17,20,23

In the past decade, the structure and electronic prop-
erties of gold clusters have been intensively studied us-
ing various theoretical methods. H¨akkinen et al. inves-
tigated the neutral and anions of Au2−10 clusters with
the local-spin-density approximation21. Gr¨onbech et al.
compared Au2 to Au5 with spin-polarized Becke-Lee-
Yang-Parr (BLYP) functional22. Bravo-P´erez et al. in-
vestigated small gold clusters up to 6 atoms at ab initio
Hartree-Fock (HF) and post-HF24 level. For the large
clusters with up to 147 atoms, H¨aberlen et al. performed
a scalar relativistic all-electron density functional calcu-
lations on several magic-sized clusters with icosahedral,
octahedral and cuboctahedral structures15. By combin-
ing pseudopotential DFT calculations with an empiri-
cal genetic algorithm, Garz´on found amorphous struc-
tures in Aun (n = 38, 55, 75) clusters.16 In addition,
there are some other works on the global minimal struc-
tures of medium-sized gold clusters based on empirical

potentials.20,25–27

Despite the achieved progress, there are still many
open questions for gold clusters. For example, no direct
experimental information is available on the structures
of smaller Aun clusters down to 38 atoms. Thus, accu-
rate ﬁrst principles calculation is important for under-
stanting the structural and electronic properties of the
those clusters. Most previous calculations on this aspect
are limited by the presumed symmetric constraints.5,15 A
unconstrained global search on the cluster potential en-
ergy surface is needed.13 Here we generate a number of
structural isomers from empirical genetic algorithm simu-
lations. These metastable isomers are further optimized
at density functional theory (DFT) level to obtain the
lowest-energy structures. The relative stabilities, elec-
tronic density of states, HOMO-LUMO gap and ioniza-
tion potentials of gold clusters are calculated and com-
pared with available experiments. The structural proper-
ties of larger gold cluster within the size range n = 20−38
will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

In this work, self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF) electronic
structure calculations on gold clusters are performed by
using a DFT-based DMol package28. A relativistic ef-
fective core potential (ECP) and a double numerical
basis including d-polarization function are used in the
calculations. The electron density functional is treated
by the local density approximation (LDA) with the
exchange-correlation potential parameterized by Perdew
and Wang29. SCF calculations are carried out with a con-
vergence criterion of 10−6 a.u. on the total energy and
electron density. Geometry optimizations are performed
with the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) al-
gorithm. We use a convergence criterion of 10−3 a.u on
the gradient and displacement, and 10−5 a.u. on the total
energy in the geometry optimization.

The accuracy of the current computational scheme
has been checked by benchmark calculations on the gold
atom and the bulk gold solid. The ionization potential
and electron aﬃnity obtained for gold atom from our
calculation are 9.78 eV and 2.51 eV respectively, which
agree well with experimental data: 9.22 eV30 and 2.31
eV31. For gold solid in fcc structure, we obtained a lat-
o
tice parameter as 4.07
A and the cohesive energy as 4.01
eV per atom, while the experimental lattice parameter is

1

o
4.08
A and experimental cohesive energy is 3.81 eV
per atom30. Thus, we believe the eﬀective core potential
and numerical basis set used in current DFT package is
reasonably good to describe diﬀerent gold systems from
atom to solid.

Due to the complexity of the electron conﬁguration of
gold atoms (5d106s1), simulated annealing (SA) determi-
nation of cluster global minimal structure at DFT level is
rather computational expensive. Alternatively, we gen-
erate a number of low-energy structural isomers for each
cluster size by using a genetic algorithm (GA).20,32,33 In
the GA simulation, we adopt molecular dynamics with
a properly ﬁtted tight-binding potential to perform local
minimizations.34 The structures generated from empiri-
cal GA simulations are then fully optimized by LDA cal-
culation to locate the global lowest-energy conﬁguration.
The essential idea is to divide the phase space into a num-
ber of regions and ﬁnd a locally stable isomer to represent
each region. The validity of present scheme is checked in
the smaller clusters by increasing number of isomers. In
our previous works, the combined scheme of DFT with
empirical GA has been veriﬁed to be an reliable and eﬃ-
cient way for modeling the structural properties of atomic
clusters up to 25 atoms35.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

the equilateral triangle, while the energy diﬀerences be-
tween these triangle isomers are very small, i.e., within
0.01 eV.

The lowest-energy structures of gold clusters with 4−6
atoms are found to adopt planar forms. For Au4, a planar
rhombus (4a) is about 0.21 eV in energy lower than the
planar ”Y-shaped” structure (4b) and 1.60 eV lower than
the three-dimensional (3D) tetrahedron (4c). For Au5,
the trapezoidal (“W-shape”) structure with C2v symme-
try (5a) is more stable than the 3D trigonal bipyramid
(5b) by 0.79 eV and the square pyramid by 0.94 eV. In
the case of Au6, we obtain a planar triangle with D3h
symmetry (6a).
It can also be understood in terms of
”W-shaped” Au5 capping by an extra atom. The 3D con-
ﬁgurations such as pentagonal pyramid (6b), octahedron
and capped trigonal bipyramid are found as local mini-
mum for Au6. The experimental photodetachment spec-
tra of Au−
6 cluster implies a planar hexagonal structure
with low electron aﬃnity and large HOMO-LUMO gap.39
The planar equilibrium structures have been obtained for
Au4−6 from previous ab initio calculations21,22,24, but
can not be obtained from empirical simulations25,26. It
is worthy to note that the other small monovalent metal
40, Ag41 and Cu42 also adopt similar
clusters such as Nan
planar conﬁgurations.

The pentagonal bipyramid (7a) is the lowest-energy
structure for Au7, which is more stable than distorted
capped octahedron by 0.03 eV, planar hexagonal struc-
ture (7b) by 0.16 eV, and capped octahedron structure
by 0.19 eV. The most stable conﬁgurations for Au8 and
Au9 are largely distorted bicapped octahedron and bi-
capped pentagonal bipyramid, respectively. The onset of
3D lowest-energy structures starting from Au7 indicate a
2D→ 3D transition around the size of 7 atoms. Similar
structural changes have been also found in alkali-metal
clusters.40

FIG. 1. The lowest-energy and metastable structures for

small Aun clusters: n = 3 − 10.

The obtained lowest-energy structures and some
metastable isomers for Aun clusters are shown in Fig.1
(n = 3 − 10) and Fig.2 (n = 11 − 20). For the Au2
dimer, the binding energy, bond length and vibration fre-
o
A and 173 cm−1,
quency are obtained as 2.43 eV, 2.55
respectively. Our current LDA results are in satisfactory
agreement with the experimental data (Eb = 2.30eV,
o
A and ω = 191cm−1).36,37 For Au3 trimer, a

Re = 2.47

o
linear chain (3a) with bond length 2.67
A is about 0.04 eV
lower in energy than the triangle structures (3b), which is
in consistent with CASSCF studies38 but on contrary to
BLYP results.21 Due to the Jahn-Teller instability, both
the obtuse and acute triangle of Au3 are more stable than

FIG. 2. The lowest-energy and metastable structures for

medium-sized Aun clusters: n = 11 − 20.

Some structural components related to icosahedron or
cuboctahedron, such as pentagonal and hexagonal struc-
tures are found in Aun from n ≥ 10. For example,
both Au10 and Au11 can be taken as two interpenetrated
pentagonal bipyramid, while the ground state structure
of Au12 is constituted by two hexagons and three pen-

2

tagons. However, the lowest-energy structure for Au13 is
neither icosahedron (13c) nor cuboctahedron (13b), but
a amorphous conﬁguration (13a in Fig.2). This disor-
dered amorphous conﬁguration is about 1.44 eV in en-
ergy lower than cuboctahedron and about 2.71 eV lower
than icosahedron. We also ﬁnd that cuboctahedron is
more stable than icosahedron, which has been predicted
by H¨aberlen.15 We have also examined the distributions
of bond lengths for Au13 and ﬁnd the disordered isomer
shows broader bond length distributions than those for
the high symmetric structures. Similar results were found
in Pt13 cluster from previous LDA calculation.43

Tabular cage structures are found for the Aun clus-
ters with n = 10 − 14. Especially, Au14 can be taken
as three interpenetrated pentagonal bipyramid. This
behavior is quite diﬀerent from the silver and copper
clusters, whose ground state conﬁgurations are usually
near-spherical icosahedron-like structures41,42,44. In the
case of Au15, we ﬁnd the characteristics from both tab-
ular cage and compact structure, implying a transition
from tabular geometry to compact one. As n ≥ 16, the
compact near-spherical structures become dominant and
can be obtained by capping on a distorted icosahedron.
However, despite there are some icosahedral-like features
in Au19, the double icosahedron is not found as lowest-
energy structure. Similar to Au13, the amorphous struc-
ture (19a) is the most stable conﬁguration for Au19. The
energy diﬀerence between amorphous and fcc structure
(19b) is 1.95 eV and the diﬀerence between the amor-
phous and the double icosahedron (19c) is 2.83 eV. Since
the amorphous structures are also found for larger Aun
(n = 38, 55, 75)16, we suggest that the geometrical struc-
ture based on amorphous packing is the common struc-
tural feature of Au clusters.

FIG. 3. The average bond length of Aun versus cluster size.

To further elucidate the growth tendencies of Au clus-
ters and the size evolution of Au-Au interactions, we de-
scribe the average bond length as a function of cluster
size in Fig.3. Three distinct steps corresponding to pla-
nar structures, tabular structures and compact structures

 

3

are found. The twice increase of average bond length
in Fig.3 reﬂect the structural transitions at n = 7 and
n = 15. The planar structure can be associated with
the directionality of Au-Au bonds, implying some cova-
lent feature in small Au clusters. As the cluster size in-
creases, metallic bonding characters become important,
which leads to the coexistence of planar structural and
compact structural characters. Thus, the tabular struc-
tures are preferred in the Au10−14 clusters. As the cluster
size further increases, metallic bonding eventually pre-
vail. Therefore, compact structure appears as the domi-
nating growth pattern of the medium-size gold clusters.
We may also employ the concept of “electronic order”
and “atomic order” as well as the interplay between 5d
and 6s electrons to explain the appearance of diﬀerent
structural characters in gold clusters45. In the small gold
clusters, the 6s valence electrons are predominant and the
5d states contribute less. Thus, the small gold clusters
should exhibit certain alkali-metal-like behaviors, e.g.,
planar ground state conﬁguration. It can be described
by s-orbital modiﬁed H¨uckel model.11 As the cluster size
increases, the contributions of d electrons become more
important and the clusters tend to adopt the more com-
pact structures. However, as the short-range interaction
between gold atoms is extraordinary strong, it favors a
tabular structure in medium-sized range. The discussions
below show that the shell eﬀect of 6s electrons still plays
some role in determining the electronic properties such as
IPs, HOMO-LUMO gaps although the geometrical eﬀect
has already manifested some “atomic order”.

Based on the lowest-energy structures, we now discuss
the electronic properties of gold clusters. In this work,
we have also calculated the adiabatic ionization poten-
tials (IPs) from the total energy diﬀerence between the
ground state neutral Aun and the fully relaxed cationic
Au+
n clusters. The binding energy, the gap between high-
est occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest oc-
cupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and ionization poten-
tials for Aun clusters are presented in Table I along with
experimental IPs46.

To explore the geometric eﬀect on the electronic struc-
ture, we compare the electronic density of states (DOS)
of Au13 for the three isomers: (a) amorphous; (b) cuboc-
tahedron; (c) icosahedron in Fig.5. The cluster electronic
DOS shows remarkable structural sensitivity. The DOS
for amorphous structures demonstrate more uniform dis-
tributions in comparison with the other two cases, be-
cause of the lower symmetry. Such structural dependence
of electronic state can be used to identify the cluster ge-
ometries with the aid of experimental spectrosopies.

∆2E(n) = E(n − 1) + E(n + 1) − 2E(n) (eV); (b)

In Fig.4a and 4b, we plot the second diﬀerences of clus-
ter total energies ∆2E(n) = E(n + 1) + E(n − 1) − 2E(n)
and HOMO-LUMO gaps as a function of cluster size.
Both the ∆2E(n) and HOMO-LUMO gap exhibit dra-
matic odd-even oscillations. The even-numbered Aun
clusters are relatively more stable than the neighbor-
ing odd-sized ones. The HOMO-LUMO gap for Au2,
Au6 and Au8 is particularly large (1.94 eV, 2.06 eV,
2.09 eV), which compares well with previous calcula-
tions by H¨akkinen (1.96 eV, 2.05 eV and 2.04 eV).21 For
n = 10 − 20, substantial HOMO-LUMO gap is found in
the Au10, Au14 and Au18 clusters (1.03 eV, 1.58 eV and
0.92 eV). The odd-even oscillation behaviors in ∆2E(n)
and HOMO-LUMO gap can be understood by electron
pairing eﬀect. The particularly high stability of Au8 and
Au18 corresponds to the magic number in electronic shell
model. The extraordinary tabular conﬁgurations for the
clusters with n = 10 − 14 might be attributed to the
interplay between electronic and geometric eﬀect.

In cluster physics, the ionization potential is an impor-
tant property that reﬂects the size-dependent evolution
of electronic structure. For alkali clusters such as Nan,
Kn, the IPs converge to its bulk limit (work function
of solid) linearly with n−1/3 (or 1/R, R is the cluster
radius)47. This behavior can be understood by a con-
ducting spherical droplet (CSD) model48,49. In Fig.6, the
theoretical and experimental IPs of Aun are plotted as a
function of n−1/3 and compared with the prediction from
classical conducting sphere droplet (CSD) model49. Our
present results agree well with the experiments, while the
CSD model can only qualitatively describe the size de-
pendence of IPs. Similar to those in Fig.4, dramatic even-
odd alternative behavior is found in Fig.6, where clusters
with even number of s valence electrons have higher IPs
than their immediate neighbors. In addition, particular
higher IP values at the magic-sized clusters such as Au2,

D
Au4, Au6, Au8, Au14 and Au18 is obtained. Some of the
magic size (Au2, Au8, Au18) can be associated to the
occupation of electronic shell47.

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, the lowest-energy geometries, binding en-
ergies, density of states, HOMO-LUMO gap and ioniza-
tion potentials of Aun(n = 2 − 20) clusters have been
obtained by LDA calculation combined with a genetic al-
gorithm. The main conclusions can be made as follows.
(1) The structures of smallest gold clusters are planar and
dominated by s electrons, similar to those of alkali-metal
clusters and other coinage-metal clusters. The contri-
butions of d electrons become more important and the
structural transition from 2-D to 3-D takes place at the
size of 7 atoms. (2) The electronic eﬀect and geometri-
cal eﬀect simultaneously inﬂuence the ground state con-
ﬁgurations of medium-sized clusters, which leads to the
tabular cage conﬁgurations with n = 10 − 14 and more
compact structures with n ≥ 15. (3) The most stable
conﬁgurations of Au13 and Au19 are neither icosahedron
nor cuboctahedron, but amorphous structures. Remark-
able diﬀerence in electronic states are found between the
structural isomers. (4) The odd-even alternation behav-
iors are found in the relative stabilities, density of states,
HOMO-LUMO gap and ionization potentials of gold clus-
ters. The even-numbered Aun clusters show relatively
higher stability.

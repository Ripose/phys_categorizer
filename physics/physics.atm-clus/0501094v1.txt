(Dated: January 15, 2014)

The B36N36 fullerene-like cage structure was proposed as candidate structure for the single-shell

boron-nitride cages observed in electron-beam irradiation experiment. We have performed all elec-

tron density functional calculations, with large polarized Gaussian basis sets, on the B36N36 cage.

We show that the cage is energetically and vibrationally stable. The infra-red, Raman and optical

spectra are calculated. The predicted spectra, in combination with experimentally measured spec-

tra, will be useful in conclusive assignment of the proposed B36N36 cage. The vertical and adiabatic

ionization potentials as well as static dipole polarizability are also reported.

were subsequently conﬁrmed by all electron calculations

origin at the center of mass. The average spherical ra-

exchange-correlation eﬀects were treated at the level

of the generalized gradient approximation using the

Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof scheme(PBE-GGA)[18]. Large

polarized Gaussian basis sets[19] optimized for density

functional calculations (PBE-GGA) are employed. The
B-atom basis set consists of 5 s−type, 4 p−type, and
3 d−type orbitals each of which were constructed from
a linear combination of 12 primitive Gaussians. For N
atoms, 5 s−type, 4 p−type, and 3 d−type functions com-
prised of 13 Gaussian are used. The geometry optimiza-

dius of the cage, obtained as the mean of distance of each
atom from the center of mass, is 3.94 ˚A. The SR method
predicts a cage of 3.76 ˚A radius[8]. Thus, the cage has
roughly dimension of 8 ˚A, somewhat smaller than the

observed dimensions of cage structure in the experiment.

Part of this discrepancy could be due to the thermal ef-

fects as our calculations are at T = 0K. The cage is

energetically stable with respect to isolated atoms and

has a binding energy (BE) of 8.43 eV per atom. The SR

method gives a binding energy of 7.53 eV/atom using

charged cation. The adiabatic ionization potential is 8.1

eV, which is an overestimate as the cation was optimized

under symmetry constraint. The mean polarizability of
B36N36 calculated from the ﬁnite ﬁeld method is 78 ˚A3.
The nuclear frame of B36N36 was assumed to be frozen

during the polarizability calculation.

The vibrational analysis within the harmonic approx-

imation indicate that all frequencies are real. Thus, the

B36N36 cage is vibrationally stable and corresponds to

a minimum on the potential surface. The calculated IR

spectrum is presented in Fig.
2. The IR spectrum is
broadened by 6 cm−1 . The IR spectra shows two con-
spicuous peaks at 1432 cm−1 and 1456 cm−1 ; the inten-
sity of the latter peak (42 Debye2/amu/˚A2) is half of the
former peak. A weak but noticeable absorption (inten-
sity 6 Debye2/amu/˚A2) is found at 797 cm−1 . All the
peaks have T2 symmetry. The Raman spectrum is also

shown in Fig. 2. The Raman spectrum is characterized
by multiple peaks in the frequency range 150 − 900 cm−1
. Of the two prominent peaks in the low frequency range,
the ﬁrst one is at 165 cm−1 and is of E type. The second
one at 188 cm−1 is due to the triply degenerate mode
of T2 symmetry. All other Raman active frequencies: at
354, 439, 796, 847, and 869 cm−1 are of A1 symmetry.
The absorption at 354 cm−1 corresponds to symmetric
stretching or breathing mode. All vibrational frequen-

It should be noted that the present calculations are per-

formed within the PBE-GGA at zero temperature and

hence the predicted optical spectra will be useful only

for qualitative comparison. More accurate spectra can

be obtained by the TDDFT or GW approximation.

In summary, density functional theory at the level of

PBE-GGA is used to examine the vibrational stabil-

ity of the proposed fullerene-like cage structure of the

B36N36 observed in a recent electron-radiation measure-

ment. The cage structure was proposed on the criteria

that it satisﬁed the isolated six square rule for alternate

BN cages and has dimension similar to the single-shell

BN cages observed in the HRTEM images. The calcu-
lations indicate somewhat smaller dimension (∼ 8 ˚A) of
the B36N36 cage than that those observed in experiments
(9−10 ˚A). The cage is energetically and vibrationally sta-
ble. It has vertical and adiatbatic ionization potential of

8.2 and 8 eV, respectively. Its mean static dipole polar-
izability is 79 ˚A3. We have predicted IR, Raman and
optical spectra at the DFT GGA level. We hope that

the predicted spectra in this work will stimulate exper-

imental measurements of these spectra. The measured

spectra, in combination with the predicated spectra in

this work, will play a decisive role in conﬁrmation of the

proposed candidate structure.

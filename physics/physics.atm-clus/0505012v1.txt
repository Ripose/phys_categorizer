Abstract. The coupled states A1Σ+
u (3P + 1S) of the calcium
dimer are investigated in a laser induced ﬂuorescence experiment combined with high-resolution Fourier-
transform spectroscopy. A global deperturbation analysis of the observed levels, considering a model,
which is complete within the subspace of relevant neighboring states, is performed using the Fourier Grid
u and c3Πu states and the
Hamiltonian method. We determine the potential energy curve of the A1Σ+
strengths of the couplings between them. The c3Πu and a3Σ+
u states are of particular importance for the
description of collisional processes between calcium atoms in the ground state 1S0 and excited state 3P1
applied in studies for establishing an optical frequency standard with Ca.

1 Introduction

←

It was recently demonstrated that an optical frequency
standard using an ensemble of ultra- cold calcium atoms,
which is probed on the intercombination transition 3P1
1S0 by a high precision laser, has the poten-
(mj = 0)
tial to exceed the microwave cesium clock in stability and
accuracy [1,2]. The performance of such an optical clock
depends on the possibility to reduce or to correct for the
eﬀects of any disturbances during the laser interrogation
of the transition. Collisions between calcium atoms lead
to a frequency shift of the transition, which limits the
achievable accuracy. Therefore, the investigation of the
collisional processes between atoms in the involved 1S0
and 3P1 states is of particular importance for the improve-
ment of the accuracy of the frequency standard. Such high
accuracy is required for testing fundamental theories for
the quest of combining general relativity with quantum
mechanics or to search for cosmological variation of natu-
ral constants.
In this perspective we have reported previously on the
study of the interactions between two 1S0 calcium atoms
[3,4]. In this article we present our investigations on the
interactions between one atom in the ground state and one
excited atom in the 3P1,2 state. With the knowledge of the
molecular potentials correlated to the 3P1 + 1S0 dissocia-
tion limit, we would be able to calculate photoassociation

spectra near the intercombination line and might gain a
better understanding of trap losses occurring during the
cooling cycle on this transition.
Like for the atomic intercombination line, the observa-
tion of the c3Πu and a3Σ+
u states by a direct excitation
from the ground state is rather ineﬃcient. However, the
c3Πu state is strongly coupled via spin-orbit interaction
to the A1Σ+
u state, which is reachable from the ground
u is indirectly coupled to the A1Σ+
state. The a3Σ+
u state
by spin-orbit and rotational coupling via the c3Πu state.
Therefore, we can investigate the A state and observe its
perturbed level structure in order to obtain information
about all potentials of the coupled states and the cou-
pling strengths. Generally, we are observing also levels of
the triplet states taking advantage of their singlet charac-
ter.
Therefore, we aim to determine the potential energy curves
of the coupled-states system A1Σ+
u (1D + 1S), c3Πu (3P
u (3P + 1S) (see ﬁgure 1). We will per-
+ 1S) and a3Σ+
form a global deperturbation analysis of the observed lev-
els, which enables us to treat all the perturbations of the
levels, simultaneously. This method will provide physical
parameters for the potentials and the coupling strengths
while local deperturbation methods will only give phe-
nomenological parameters [5]. We collect spectroscopic in-
formation of a whole set of rovibrational levels of the cou-
pled states. The shape of the potential curves will be ad-
justed by a ﬁtting procedure.
This article is organized as follows. In section 2, we re-
view the previous investigations of the coupled states. The

therefore we used their data in our own analysis. Their
assignment of the lowest observed vibrational level of the
A state is vH&H = 7. This high lying number 7 leaves
room for diﬀerent assignments. Therefore, vibrational as-
signment will be re-established using the additional and
more precise spectroscopic data we have measured. This
notation vH&H for the vibrational quantum number v will
be used here on to distinguish the earlier from a new as-
signment given below.

observations

The calcium dimer was formed in a stainless steel heat
pipe oven, characteristics of which are described in a pre-
vious publication [3]. The pipe was ﬁlled with approxi-
mately 5g of 40Ca (99, 5% purity) and with argon as buﬀer
gas at a pressure around 50 mbar. We operated the oven
at temperatures between 1240 K and 1275 K. The sam-
ple was irradiated along the pipe axis by diﬀerent laser
sources. A frequency stabilized, linear dye laser (Coher-
ent 599) pumped by an argon ion laser (Innova 400), us-
ing Pyridine 1 and DCM dyes, was run in single mode
with a typical output power of 70 mW. Transitions of the
g system in the intervals from 13850 cm−1
A1Σ+
to 14550 cm−1 and from 14900 cm−1 to 15650 cm−1 are
excited. We collected the induced ﬂuorescence through a
Fourier-transform spectrometer (Bruker IFS 120HR) by a
broad band photomultiplier. This total collection results
to the LIF data set. Each recorded spectrum exhibits a
single progression of rotational doublets as expected from
the selection rule ∆J =
1 for the rotational quantum
Σ transitions. Few spectra show sev-
number J for Σ
eral progressions due to the overlap of exciting transitions
with the laser frequency within their Doppler linewidth.
Because the rotational spacing of the doublets is deter-
mined by the ground state and thus well known [4], the
rotational assignment of the observed lines is obtained
without ambiguity. The strongest lines are surrounded by
collisionally induced satellites. These satellite lines permit
to measure the position of neighboring rovibrational levels
around the excited levels. Figure 2 shows the P-R doublets
progression from the excitation transition (vH&H = 12, J
(v”=0, J”=28) at 15514.843 cm−1. On the insert

a zoom around the ﬂuorescence lines P(28) and R(30) of
vX= 0 shows the relatively large number of collision in-
duced satellites (24 satellites corresponding to 12 diﬀerent
J values).

Due to the possible excitation of diﬀerent classes of ve-
locities depending on the frequency of the laser, a Doppler
shift can occur. Before recording with the Fourier spec-
trometer, we ensured that the excitation was tuned to
the maximum of emission for the selected A-X transi-
tions for which we directed the ﬂuorescence, emitted in
the forward direction of the laser, to a 1 m monochroma-
tor (GCA/McPherson Instruments). It was used with a
band pass of about 2 to 5 cm−1 width. The center of the
frequency window was set to the position of a line of the

experimental set-up and the spectroscopic observations re-
alized by laser induced ﬂuorescence and ﬁltered laser ex-
citation spectroscopy are reported in section 3. We derive
the Hamiltonian of the coupled states in section 4, and
describe, in section 5, the global deperturbation analysis
for determining the potential energy curves of the coupled
states and coupling interactions. In section 6, we discuss
the results of the deperturbation analysis and conclude
in section 7 by a comparison with earlier results and by
proposing further studies.

X1Σ+

The A1Σ+
g system was observed by Bondybey
and English [7] in a supersonic jet created from the vapor-
ization of calcium metal by a pulsed laser. The spectro-
scopic interrogation was realized by a pulsed dye laser sys-
tem limiting the experimental uncertainty to a few tenths
of a wave number. Several bands starting from low rovi-
brational levels of the ground state were observed.
Hofmann and Harris published the results of a more sys-
tematic investigation of the A1Σ+
g system [8,9].
They performed laser induced ﬂuorescence spectroscopy
in a heat pipe oven, and applied the ﬁltered laser excita-
tion technique (FLE) to observed band heads. They stated
an experimental uncertainty of 0.01 cm−1. From the ob-
servation of P-R doublets they assigned the progression
to the A1Σ+
g system, and measured 720 lines
corresponding to 340 diﬀerent rovibrational levels of the
coupled states A and c. Their observed and assigned tran-
sitions are available through the original publication [9],

frequency uncertainties of the observed lines to be 10 times
smaller than their line widths. For lines with lower SNR,
we estimated a higher uncertainty proportional to the re-
duced SNR.
In the frequency range accessible with our dye lasers the
excitation and detection of ﬂuorescence progressions from
vH&H = 4 have less favorable Franck-Condon factors (4
times smaller than for vH&H = 3). In consequence the
number of collisional satellites with good signal-to-noise
ratio was reduced to very few. In this case, the Fourier-
transform spectroscopy does not help to observe a wide
portion of the vibrational band by the satellites.
We applied the ﬁltered laser excitation spectroscopy (FLE)
by recording the emission of Ca2 through the monochro-
mator. The temperature of the oven was chosen to 1240 K
since the enhancement of the collisional transfer of popula-
tion is not needed for the FLE spectroscopy. For absolute
and relative frequency calibration, the absorption lines of
iodine from a 60 cm long cell (heated up to 870 K), and
marker cavity peaks, with 149.7 MHz spectral spacing,
were recorded. A precise description of the technique is
given in [4]. Rotational levels from J = 27 to 77 were ob-
served for vH&H = 4 in this way. The (4, 61)
(11, 62)
measured Ca2 line is presented in the ﬁgure 3 as example.
We used the IodineSpec software program [10] to calibrate
the spectra. It provides a prediction of I2 transitions with
accuracy better than 25 MHz in this spectral region. The
width of the calcium lines was 0.042(1) cm−1 correspond-
ing to the Doppler width of 0.04 cm−1 and a residual
broadening of about 0.012(3) cm−1. The width of the io-
dine lines was in the order of 0.04 cm−1 depending on the
unresolved hyperﬁne structure. The absolute experimental
uncertainty is determined by the precision of the estima-
tion of the I2 and Ca2 line centers. The signal-to-noise
ratio was suﬃciently high for the I2 and Ca2 lines to allow
a determination of their centers better than 0.004 cm−1
for each of them. The ﬁnal accuracy of the line position
was then estimated to be 0.006 cm−1.
We have constructed term energies from our observed
transitions and those reported by Hofmann and Harris [9]
in adding the term energies of the involved levels of the
well-known ground state potential [4]. From the LIF data
set, the term energy of a level of the A state is obtained
several times since the observed spectrum consists of a
rovibrational progression from that selected upper level.
Within each observed progression we have averaged the
constructed term energies weighted by their relative un-
certainties. To the resulting uncertainty from this average,
we added the absolute uncertainty 0.009 cm−1, which is
the absolute uncertainty of the frequency given by the
Fourier-transform spectrometer, to obtain the experimen-
tal uncertainty of one term energy. Then the term ener-
gies of the same levels from diﬀerent recordings have been
averaged, weighted with their respective experimental un-
certainty. Finally, the total uncertainty varies from 0.009
cm−1 to 0.0380 cm−1. The data of Hofmann and Harris
consist of P and R transitions for 340 levels of the A state.
We averaged the two values obtained for each upper level.
We mention here that the levels observed by the ﬁltered

induced ﬂuorescence progression with favorable Franck-
Condon factors, involving typically a low lying vibrational
level of the ground state. The light passing through the
monochromator was detected using a broad band Hama-
matsu photomultiplier (R928). The detection of the ﬂuo-
rescence intensity allowed setting and ﬁxing the laser fre-
quency to the maximum of emission.
In this way, ﬂuorescence progressions have been observed
from the systematic excitation of rotational levels of vH&H =
1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Additional rotational levels of
vH&H = 5, 10, 12, and 13 have been observed. The levels
below vH&H = 7 are levels, which were not observed by
Hofmann and Harris [9].
Special care should be put on the experimental uncertain-
ties. By setting the laser to the center of the line, we re-
duced the possible Doppler shifts to a magnitude of about
0.006 cm−1
180 MHz. The drift of the frequency of the
stabilized laser was less than 10 MHz per hour, which is
suﬃciently smaller than the desired setting of the cen-
ter frequency given above and certainly also smaller than
the Doppler width of the lines in this frequency region
0.043 cm−1), to allow a stable excitation

during the time of recording (
20 min corresponding to
20 scans). The resolution of the Fourier-transform inter-
ferometer was chosen to be 0.05 cm−1. With a triangular
apodization, the instrument line width is 0.05 cm−1. Since
in single mode operation of the laser, only a selected ve-
locity class is excited, no Doppler broadening is expected,
and velocity changing collisions play no role under these
5 ns [7] giv-
conditions. The lifetime of the A state is 57

The LIF and FLE spectroscopic techniques enabled us to
observe six lower vibrational levels of the A state com-
pared to the data set observed by Hofmann and Harris.
Local perturbations have been identiﬁed at lower energy
than the energy of the lowest perturbation observed in
their study, which they proposed to be caused by vc = 0
of c3Πu (0+). Therefore, these observations show already
the necessity of a revision of their vibrational assignment
for the c3Πu state. Since more information on the lower
vibrational levels of the A1Σ+
u has been collected, the vi-
brational assignment of this state should be examined,
too. A list of all known transition frequencies of the sys-

laser excitation technique have an experimental uncer-
tainty smaller than those obtained by LIF and those of
Hofmann and Harris’ data set. Only level vH&H = 4 has
been observed with this technique. In order to avoid a too
high weight for the ﬁts on this single vibrational level com-
pared to all the others, we have increased their uncertain-
ties to 0.015 cm−1which is equal to the typical uncertainty
of the LIF line with good signal-to-noise ratio.
Figure 4 shows the obtained term energies with respect
to the minimum of the ground state potential [4]. The
progressions as function of J(J+1) for each vibrational
levels of the A state are clearly visible. In the insert, the
term energies of vH&H = 9, 10, and 11 around J = 45, i.e
J(J+1) = 2070, are presented as examples, to show the
perturbed rotational structure of the levels of the A1Σ+
u
state. Around a crossing with a vibrational level of the
c3Πu state, the mixing between the two states becomes
important. The levels of the triplet c state get suﬃcient
singlet character to become observable yielding extra lines
in the spectrum. The energy positions of such levels are
important since they carry a lot of information about the
c state and the coupling strength.
We have compared the data set from Hofmann and Har-
ris to our own measurements by calculating the diﬀerences
between term energies formed with their and our observed
transitions. The overlapping set consists of 64 common
levels. The data set from Hofmann and Harris is shifted
in average by 0.037 cm−1 to higher energy compared to
our measured set. The standard deviation of this shift is
0.038 cm−1. This spread is larger than our experimen-
tal accuracy and the one claimed by Hofmann and Harris
(0.01 cm−1). We assign to all their data an error of 0.038
cm−1. Later on, the global treatment shows that the data
set of Hofmann and Harris should be lowered by 0.028
cm−1 to give the best ﬁt. We remove from the data set of
Hofmann and Harris the 64 common levels and keep ours,
since they have been observed with a higher accuracy. The
total data set consists of 502 term energies.

3.1 Vibrational and rotational assignments

From the ﬁrst inspection of the data we assumed that no
local perturbation was found for v H&H < 4, which was
later conﬁrmed by the complete analysis. The coupling
between the A state and the c state aﬀects the vibrational
levels below vH&H = 4 only by a global shift of the rovibra-
tional levels towards lower energies (see [5]). The variation
of the shifts with vH&H and J is monotonic compared to
the local perturbation at higher vH&H-values. These shifts
are also much smaller than the vibrational spacing of the
levels. We can thus consider that although a one-channel
ﬁt of such levels will not provide a good reproduction of
energy level positions, it will nevertheless be suﬃcient for a
good estimate of Franck-Condon factors (FCF). We tested
diﬀerent assignments of the A state by comparing the in-
tensity pattern of the ﬂuorescence progressions to the FCF
calculated from the ﬁtted potential corresponding to each

compared to the predicted Franck-Condon factors for the
diﬀerent assignments, and normalized to the most intense
line of each progression. These comparisons are presented
in ﬁgure 5. In this ﬁgure the assignment corresponding
to the ∆v = +2 has been omitted for saving space. Con-
vincing agreement is obtained for ∆v = +1. Therefore all
observed vibrational levels have been shifted by +1 for
the A state. This correct assignment will be used in the
remainder of this article as vA = vH&H + 1.
To determine the vibrational assignment of the c state,
we have to ﬁnd the position of the lowest local pertur-
bation on the rotational progressions of the vibrational
levels of the A state. This perturbation is then assigned
to a crossing with vc = 0 of the c3Πu (Ω = 0) state. In ﬁg-
ure 6, an estimate of the eﬀective rotational constant Bv
2) is presented for levels vA = 2 to 8. ∆(E) is
= ∆(E)/(4J
the spacing between two observed consecutive rotational
levels (J
2) and J. We see on the lower graph that the
Bv-values of vA = 7 and 8 abruptly decrease due to local
perturbations. Despite that only two Bv-values are ob-
tained for vA = 6, the signiﬁcantly lower values clearly in-
dicate the presence of a local perturbation. If we compare
the magnitude of the variation of the rotational constants
for vA = 3 and 2 with the higher vibrational levels, eﬀects
of local perturbations on these two levels should be visi-
ble in the range of observed rotational numbers, despite
the observation gaps in the series of levels. But, such a
local perturbation is not present. Instead we have smooth
and slight decrease of the eﬀective rotational constant. A
relatively fast change of the eﬀective rotational constant
is visible for vA = 5 at J values approaching 77. A mod-
erate decrease of the Bv-values for vA = 4 is observed at

high J indicating the onset of a local perturbation for this
vibrational level. Considering that no local perturbations
are present for vA = 3 and 2 for J < 109 and assuming
that the same vibrational level of the c state causes the
two local perturbations on vA = 4 and 5, we conclude that
these two local perturbations are the lowest in energy, and
are caused by the level vΩ=0
= 0 of the c3Πu state, which
is the lowest in the whole manifold of 3Πu. These obser-
vations and assumptions will lead to a consistent picture
of the perturbations as we will show in section 5.
Even if there are no crossings with the c state levels of
the lower levels of the A state they are globally shifted to
lower energy due to their couplings to all the levels above.
Consequently, a global treatment of the coupled states is
required.

c3Πu and a3Σ+
u both correlated to the (4s4s1S + 4s4p3P)
asymptote, see ﬁgure 1. Other states dissociating at the
asymptote 4s4s1S + 4s3d3D can couple to the considered
states (see ﬁg. 1) but they are expected to lie above the
triplet manifold according to the ab initio calculations of
[12]. Their coupling will be much less pronounced due
to the absence of resonance eﬀects, and will not be in-
cluded in our analysis. Consequently we will derive poten-
tials that might contain these small inﬂuences, and, in this
respect, should be considered as eﬀective potentials. Two
potentials, the 3Πu (1S + 3D ) and the 3∆u (1S + 3D ) are
deep enough according to ab initio calculations to overlap
and cross the repulsive branch of the c state (see ﬁg. 1).
But this overlap appears at the very bottom of these po-
tentials, where the density of levels is small. The magni-
tude of the perturbations will be most likely small, because
of low Franck-Condon factors between these states and the
states A and c. The inﬂuence of these states is neglected in
our deperturbation analysis. For a similar reason the in-
ﬂuence of the a3Σ+
u state is small since it is much deeper
than the c state to which it is coupled. Near the asymp-
totic limit (3P + 1S) where the energy spacing between
the potential of the c state and the a state becomes smaller
than the spin-orbit interaction the coupling between these
states is not negligible. The way to include this state in
our analysis will be discussed in section 5.3.

In Hund’s case (a) the angular momentum basis functions
are
α, J, S, Ω, Λ, Σ >, where Λ and Σ are respectively the

projections onto the molecular axis of the total electronic
orbital angular momentum and of the total electronic spin
momentum, Ω = Λ + Σ, and α stands for all other state
labels (e.g. electronic conﬁguration, g/u symmetry). The
two indistinguishable calcium atoms are bosons with nu-
clear spin zero, therefore levels of the ground state exist
only for even J and have (e) symmetry, where the (e
f ) basis

functions are deﬁned by the inversion symmetry (

for molecules with even number of electrons [13]. Thus,
only rotational levels with (e) symmetry and odd J of
the A1Σ+
u system can be observed via
the excitation from the ground state X1Σ+
g . In addition,
perturbation can only occur between levels of same (e
f )
symmetry. Therefore, in the following we only consider
the subspace of levels with (e) symmetry. The properly
symmetrized functions with (e) symmetry and odd values
of J are the following ([11]):

The Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule in the body-ﬁxed

tion in the case of K2 in [5]. We give here the matrix ele-

5.1 Fourier Grid representation of the Hamiltonian

The potentials of the considered sub-space will be deter-
mined by minimizing the standard deviation between ob-
served term energies and calculated term energies from
solving the Schr¨odinger equation with the Hamiltonian of
(eq. (22)). The minimization is realized with a non-linear
ﬁtting routine [14]. The Schr¨odinger equation is solved
using the Fourier Grid Hamiltonian method (FGH) [5,15,
16]. In this method the internuclear distance is discretized
by a grid with N equidistant points for a length L. In
this representation the potential and coupling operators,
which are local in the R-coordinate space, are diagonal.
In contrast the kinetic energy matrix, which contains the
derivative with respect to R is non-diagonal. Therefore the
Hamiltonian matrix of a system of p coupled states has a

than half of the smallest local de Broglie wavelength Λ(R)
of the relative nuclear motion, following the Nyquist the-
orem [17] for a proper calculation of the energy positions
π ¯h/√2µ∆V, where ∆V is the diﬀer-
of the levels: ∆R
ence between the highest considered energy and the lowest
minimum of the diﬀerent potentials. By calling upon the
Nyquist theorem, we implicitly consider the wave function
as sine waves. This is an approximation since the variation
of the amplitude of the wave functions in the classically
forbidden region is not sinusoidal but exponential. There-
fore we multiply by a parameter lower than one to set
∆R to lower values than estimated by the above equation
for getting the uncertainty of the calculated term energies
smaller than our experimental uncertainty. We found that
the necessary value for a proper representation should be
smaller than 0.7 times the Nyquist estimate. We used the
factor 0.5 to have a correct representation and to avoid an
unnecessary high number of grid points. The term energies
are located between 14600 cm−1 and 16272 cm−1(the zero
of energy is the minimum of the ground state potential see
[4]). The classical vibrational motions are restricted in the
interval from 3.08 ˚A to 4.52 ˚A for the A state and from
3.37 ˚A to 8.65 ˚A for the c state in the non-coupled pic-
ture. For our grid choice ranging from 2.12 ˚A to 11.11
˚A the representation of the states of the model (p = 5)
requires a 1235

1235 matrix.

5.2 Construction of potential and coupling functions

We split the representation of the potentials in three re-
gions: the repulsive wall (R<Rinn), the asymptotic region
(R>Rout), and the intermediate region in between. For the
intermediate region, we use the following representation:

Vﬁt(R) =

ai ξ(R)i

with the analytic function

ξ(R) =

, b, and Rm are free parameters (Rm is close
where
to the value of the equilibrium distance). We used 13 pa-
rameters ai for the A state and 17 for the c state. The ex-
perience in our group, obtained by ﬁtting potentials with
this choice of representation, shows that this manifold of
parameters should allow correct descriptions of the poten-
tial curves, for the range of observed vibrational levels and
for the expected well behaved potentials according to the

ab initio calculations from [12] (no shelf or double well
structure1). We have no direct spectroscopic observation
for the a3Σ+
u state, as it is weakly coupled to the A1Σ+
u
and c3Πu (Ω = 0) states. So, we determine an initial set of
parameters from the published ab initio curve of ref. [12].
These latter parameters were kept ﬁxed during the ﬁt.
The potentials are continuously extrapolated below Rinn
with:

VBO(R) = A + B/R10

(> 15% an estimation from the deperturbation analysis
below). Since the Ω = 1 component of the c3Πu and a3Σ+
u
states and the Ω = 2 component of the c3Πu state are
weakly coupled to the A1Σ+
u state, the number of levels
of these states which have a signiﬁcant singlet character
is low. Hence, the information about the Ω = 1 and 2
components of the c3Πu state is low or negligible with our
data set. Therefore, the information to characterize the
spin-orbit splitting A(R) is limited. We then deﬁne the
ﬁtted potential as the potential of the Ω = 0 component
of the c3Πu state:

c (R) = V 0

The parameter CA

the classical forbidden redion of the A1Σ+
u state with the
classically allowed redion of the c gives signiﬁcant shifts
of levels. However, our value of CA
5 should not be consid-
ered as true long-range coeﬃcent because even the highest
observed values are far below the atomic asymptote. The

The a3Σ+
u state potential is about four times deeper than
the investigated energy range below the asymptote 3P+1S,
which induces a small grid step in the FGH representation
(see section 5.1), and increases the Hamiltonian matrix
size in the FGH representation. Since this state is weakly
coupled to the c3Πu (Ω = 0) and only strongly coupled
to the c3Πu (Ω = 1) its inﬂuence on the description of
the spectroscopic data is expected to be weak. We took
into account the coupling between the a3Σ+
u (Ω = 1) state
and the c3Πu (Ω = 1) state by replacing the c3Π(Ω = 1)
potential by the adiabatic 1u(c3Π) potential with respect
to the spin-orbit coupling ζ(R) (ﬁg. 8), obtained by the
diagonalization of the simpliﬁed 2

where rotational couplings have been neglected. The model
is thus reduced to an eﬀective 4-states model, and conse-
quently the total representation is reduced to a 293

mated by ζ(R) = A(R).

able, which could properly model the spin-orbit splitting

spin-orbit functions (eq. (32)) to an adjustable constant.
Additionally, the time for achieving convergence of the
ﬁt depends critically on the initial guesses for the poten-
tial energy curves and the couplings. Therefore, we con-
structed initial potentials for the Ω = 0+ components of
the A1Σ+
u and the c3Πu states, which yield the best possi-
ble reproduction of the observed rovibrational ladders. As
we can see in the ﬁgures 4 and 9, the vibrational and rota-
tional structure can be well identiﬁed for the A state. To
construct the potentials, we calculated traditional Dun-
ham parameters from the rovibrational ladder and derived
RKR potentials with these parameters and converted to
analytic potentials according to eq. (23) by a simple linear
ﬁt. For the c state, we only have the local perturbations
to construct an initial potential. The rotational ladder of
one vibrational level of the c state crosses several rota-
tional ladders of diﬀerent vibrational levels of the A state
at diﬀerent J-values. This was used to estimate the rota-
tional constants, and vibrational spacing to obtain an ini-
tial c state potential. These constructed potentials give the
rovibrational levels exempliﬁed in ﬁgure 9. In this manner,
we ensured that the ladders of both states cross at the ob-
served local perturbations.
We can expect that the coupling of the states leads to a
shift of each level locally caused by the closest levels of
the perturbing state and to a global shift coming from the
accumulated inﬂuence of all the other levels. The selection
of levels following a regular rovibrational series estimated
from the observed levels, which are not strongly deviating
from such regular behavior, gives a rough estimation of
the positions of the levels of the uncoupled states, since
the global eﬀect is not properly taken into account. In
a ﬁrst iteration step, we ﬁtted only the spin-orbit con-
stant. In this way, we obtained a ﬁrst guess of the value
of this constant and the magnitude of the shifts caused by
the coupling. These shifts have been subtracted from the
observed term energies, which are not strongly perturbed.
Then, the initial potential of the A state has been ﬁtted to
these roughly deperturbed levels. The obtained potential
has been used again to improve the value of the spin-orbit
constant. The procedure has been repeated several times
to improve iteratively the A state potential and the cou-
pling. Then, this method has been employed once for im-
proving the c state using this time the strongly perturbed
levels and the obtained value of the coupling constant. The
initial potentials and the constant coupling result in a di-
mensionless standard deviation ¯σ = 170 between observed
and calculated levels. The improved potentials obtained
by the iterative procedure lead to a standard deviation of
¯σ = 60.
The obtained potentials and the value of the spin-orbit
parameter provided the starting conditions for the global
ﬁt itself.

5.5 Result with the 4-states model

Practically, we have extended the ﬁt iteratively, ﬁrst both
0+ components, second adding Ω = 1 of c3Π and third
Ω = 2 of c3Π to avoid to ﬁt directly a large number of

A(R) and the spin-orbit couplings χ(R). Only the values
at the atomic limit are known. The spin-orbit splitting
converges to the atomic spin-orbit value A0 = 52.940 cm−1
[18]. The spin-orbit coupling χ(R) vanishes for large R
since the atomic coupling between the (4s3d)1D state and
the (4s4p)3P state is zero because of diﬀerent parities. We
have represented these interactions in diﬀerent R ranges as
for the potentials (see above). Polynomial functions in the
inner range allow for suﬃcient ﬂexibility. For the outer re-
gion we ensure continuity at the connecting point Rc and
correct atomic values for the asymptote. The representa-
tion of the functions is expressed as:

where κ(R) stands for A(R) or χ(R), and asymptotically

parameter R2 is chosen to be close to the internuclear dis-
tance corresponding to the crossing between the A1Σ+
u
state and the c3Πu state, and κp, κs are ﬁtting parame-
ters. The parabolic extrapolation below Rs is used only
for χ(R). A(R) is not truncated below Rs.

5.4 Fitting strategy

The ﬁt of our spectroscopic data to analytical potential
curves and coupling functions is a highly non-linear prob-
lem and the parameters to be derived are strongly cor-
related. Therefore, we should start the ﬁtting procedure
with the simplest model possible in order to reduce the
number of parameters and thus the complexity of the
problem. For this reason, we ﬁrst limited the model to the
Ω = 0+ components of the A1Σ+
u state and the c3Πu state
and simpliﬁed the polynomial part of the non-diagonal

O. Allard et al.: Study of coupled states for the (4s2)1S + (4s4p)3P asymptote of Ca2.

11

free parameters. This is justiﬁed since the magnitude of
the coupling is weak between components with Ω
= 0 and
Ω = 0 compared to the spin-orbit coupling between the
u state and the c3Πu (Ω = 0) state. Therefore, the
A1Σ+
adiabatized Ω = 1 component and the Ω = 2 component
of the c state and the diagonal spin-orbit splitting were
successively introduced when the convergence of the sim-
pliﬁed models was reached. The only contribution, which
remains neglected in the model, is the spin-spin splitting
(eq. (9)) since its magnitude is expected to be small com-
pared to our experimental uncertainty. The parameter ǫ
was kept at zero.
Figure 10 shows the quality of the ﬁnal representation of
the observed levels, which have been reached with the 4-
states model. The rotational ladders of vA = 7, 12, and 16
are taken as examples. For each case in the upper part, we
show the observed levels from which we have subtracted
[J(J+1)] in order
the linear function Ev(J = 0) + Bv ×
to show better the good reproduction of the perturba-
tions. For each vA , the lower graph shows the diﬀerences
between observed and calculated term energies. We see
that most of the residuals lie within the experimental er-
ror bars. The perturbations, which can reach magnitudes
of 8 cm−1, are reproduced to tenths of a wave number.
Therefore, the global reproduction of the position of ob-
served levels given by the normalized standard deviation
σ = 1.65 is satisfactory corresponding to a standard devi-
ation of 0.053 cm−1. This quality is only achievable with a
model which includes the four considered states. Figure 11
shows the improvement beginning with the 2-states model,
containing only the components Ω = 0+ of the A1Σ+
u and
c3Πu states, by the successive addition of the adiabatized
Ω = 1 component (3-states model) and Ω = 2 component
(4-states model) of the c3Πu state. The improvement is
particularly visible for the A state levels near J = 39 and
81, which have a clear mixing with the Ω = 1 state and
a weaker mixing with Ω = 2. Note the diﬀerent scales of
the panels. The inclusion of the third and, later on, fourth
state leads to local improvements but also gives a bet-
ter overall representation. The relative magnitudes of the
residuals for the 2-states model compared to the 3-states
model exemplify clearly the important role of the diﬀerent
states. The achieved standard deviation with the 2-states
model is only σ = 4 and σ = 1.98 for the 3-states model,
and ﬁnally σ = 1.65 for the 4-states model.
Nevertheless, a completely satisfying reproduction of the
observed levels within their experimental uncertainties was
not reached with the considered model. In ﬁgures 10 and
11, we see that systematic trends in the residuals remain
(for instance in ﬁg. 10 for vA = 16 between J(J+1)
250
and 1000 ). We also see that the large residuals are located
systematically at the position of the strong perturbations
and they are two to four times larger than the error bars.
We veriﬁed that such trends and large residuals will not
be reduced by an increase of the number of parameters for
the potentials.
Figure 12 shows the spin-orbit functions obtained by the
ﬁt. In the range of data (i.e. within the classical turning
points of observed levels), their variations are slow, despite

the large ﬂexibility that the choice of representation (eq.

rameters for the coupling functions will not give a better
representation of the observations. This can be explained
by the fact that the data are mainly sensitive to the av-
eraged strength of the couplings and not so much to the
details of the shape of the couplings. Hence, obtaining

The derived parameters for the potentials and the cou-

the A1Σ+

from 3.08 ˚A to 4.52 ˚A and the ﬁtted potential for the c3Πu
from 3.37 ˚A to 8.60 ˚A. The outer turning points for the

order to have proper boundary conditions to diagonalize
the Hamiltonian matrix.

6 Discussion

The variations of the residuals seen ﬁg. 10 and ﬁg. 11 could
be attributed to perturbations caused by other states. But
they have small magnitudes and appear at positions of

level crossings between the A1Σ+
u state and the two com-
ponents (Ω = 0 and 1) of the c3Πu states. Therefore, possi-
ble additional perturbing states should only have an indi-
rect coupling to those latter states or a direct coupling to
the c3Πu (Ω = 1) state. According to the ab initio calcula-
tions from Czuchaj et al. [12] the bottom of the 3Πu state
and the 3∆u state, dissociating to 3D + 1S, approach re-
gion of observed levels. That 3Πu state is coupled directly
to the A state and to all Ω-components of the c state.
Thus, perturbations should also occur at diﬀerent J and
not only at J corresponding to rotational level crossings
between the A state and the c state. Such additional per-
turbations are not observed within our experimental un-
certainty. This state is probably less deep than predicted
and may lead only to a global shift to all the levels. The
derived potentials in our model could include such global
shift and would be in this respect eﬀective potentials.
The 3∆u(Ω = 1) state and the a3Σ+
u state are indirectly
coupled to the Ω = 0 components of the A and c states
via a direct coupling to the c3Πu(Ω = 1) state by spin-
orbit interaction. We took the potential curves of these
states [12], one by one, and the non-diagonal spin-orbit
function χ(R) to calculate their respective inﬂuence on

the position of levels of the coupled states, leading to a
5-states model. We found that among these states only
the 3∆u can create additional deviations to the calculated
levels. They appear at positions of strong perturbations
between the levels of the A1Σ+
u and c3Πu (Ω = 0) and
at positions of weaker perturbations between the A1Σ+
u
states and the c3Πu (Ω = 1) state. Furthermore, the cal-
culated magnitude of these perturbations is of the same
order as the observed larger residuals. The 3∆u is a good
candidate to explain why the present model was incom-
plete for providing a totally satisfactory reproduction of
the observed levels. For reaching the experimental pre-
cision by the coupled-states calculation it might be thus
necessary to extend the 4-states model by the 3∆u(Ω = 1)
and (Ω = 2) states. This implies that spectroscopic data
for these states are needed, which could be obtained by
multi-photon spectroscopy or by searching for very weak
extra lines from the coupling.

Notable diﬀerences exist with the recent ab initio calcula-
tions of potential energy curves for these states, in partic-
ular for the c3Πu (0+) state. The results of the relativistic
ab initio calculations presented in [20] give a dissociation
energy of 168 cm−1, which is in strong disagreement with
the value of 1470.2(10) cm−1 determined in our experi-
mental study. Furthermore, the last two potential points
given in [20] at large internuclear distance lie above the ex-
pected asymptotic limit, which is in contradiction with the
attractive long-range behavior of the c3Πu (0+) state (see
[19]). The dissociation energy of 1575 cm−1 of the c3Πu
state derived with non-relativistic calculations by Czuchaj
et al. [12] is in reasonable agreement (within 6.6%) with
our experimental value. The agreement with the dissocia-
u of 9518 cm−1 given in [12] (Re-
tion energy of the A1Σ+
member the proposed reassignment given in footnote 1)
compared to our derived experimental value of 8845.0(10)
cm−1 is in the same order (within 7.6%).

+ 1S) using the laser induced ﬂuorescence and the ﬁltered
laser excitation technique. Rotational series of six new vi-
brational levels at the bottom of the A state have been
observed compared to the previous study of Hofmann and
Harris [9]. It allowed us to reassign the A state with great
conﬁdence. The lowest perturbations of the A state lev-
els have been identiﬁed and consequently the c state has
been reassigned. We have developed a description of the
observed levels in which the spin-orbit couplings and the
u , c3Πu and a3Σ+
rotational couplings between the A1Σ+
u
are modeled. The Fourier Grid Hamiltonian method in-
cluded in a ﬁtting procedure allowed a global treatment
of the coupled states, and led to a detailed description
of the spectroscopic observations compared to the previ-
ous derivation from Hofmann and Harris [9]. They have
obtained a reproduction of the observed 340 term ener-
gies of 0.13 cm−1 by a local deperturbation analysis. 183
coupling parameters and 16 Dunham coeﬃcients were de-
termined to reach this quality. These large numbers are
due to the fact that the coupling of each level to all the
other levels of the coupled states are modeled with local
perturbations introducing for each new perturbing level a
new parameter. In addition, there is some ambiguity in
the choice of levels to be considered as inﬂuencing. This
shows the limits of local methods for the treatment of rel-
atively strongly coupled states.
We have determined potential energy curves for the A1Σ+
u
state and the c3Πu state as well as spin-orbit coupling
functions. For the two eﬀective states (A1Σ+
u , c3Πu (0+))
and the coupling functions 39 parameters have been de-

rived from the ﬁt and 22 parameters ﬁxed for the a3Σ+
u
(1) state potential or for the continuation to small or large
R . Small deviations remain with the present model. We
believe that such eﬀects can be explained by the neigh-
boring 3∆u(3D + 1S) state, which was not reasonable to
include in the model. More precise data of the studied sys-
tem, and in particular for the c3Πu state and the 3∆u are
needed.
In their spectroscopic investigations of Ca2 in a supersonic
jet Bondybey and English [7] have observed band system
centered around 15000 cm−1 belonging to the A1Σ+
u −
X1Σ+
g system and additional bands that were not identi-
ﬁed (see ﬁg. 1 in [7]). Our analysis allowed us to correct
the vibrational assignment of these molecular bands and
to assigned the previously unidentiﬁed bands to the c3Πu
g system (see [6]). Since levels of the c3Πu state
−
have been directly observed in their jet experiment, the
spectroscopic study of the c state in a molecular beam
seems promising. Particularly the observation of high ly-
ing levels of the c state is of interest for a better character-
ization of the collision processes between one 3P and one
1S calcium atom. The short-range coupling of the other
state, except the a3Σ+
u state, are predicted to be weak for
the long-range levels of the c state. In this respect the de-
scriptions will not involve a more complex model than the
present one. Therefore, this model should provide a good
understanding of ultra-cold collisions in a Ca trap where
the intercombination line of calcium is studied to establish
this resonance as an optical frequency standard.

Abstract

We report the total integrated cross-section (TICS) of two-photon double ionization of helium

in the photon energy range from 42 to 50 eV. Our computational procedure relies on a numerical

solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation on a square-integrable basis and subsequent

projection of this solution on a set of ﬁnal states describing two electrons in continuum. Close to

the threshold, we reproduce results previously known from the literature. The region 47 − 50 eV

seems to have been previously unexplored. Our results suggest that TICS, as a function of the

photon energy, grows monotonously in the region 42 − 50 eV. We also present fully resolved triple

diﬀerential cross sections for selected photon energies.

INTRODUCTION

Multi-photon atomic ionization resulting in ejection of a single electron, as well as other

single active electron phenomena in intense laser ﬁelds, are relatively well understood by now

[1]. In contrast, strong ﬁeld ionization with several active electrons involved is a much more

challenging problem in which the highly nonlinear ﬁeld interaction is entangled with the few-

body correlated dynamics [2]. The two-photon double-electron ionization (TPDI) of helium

is the archetypal reaction of this kind. Even for this simplest many-photon many-electron

process, non-perturbative treatment of the external ﬁeld is essential as well as a proper

account of correlation in the two-electron continuum. Neglect of either aspects of TPDI

results in a gross failure. In Ref. [3], for instance, it was demonstrated that a perturbative

treatment of the external ﬁeld in this process can lead to an order of magnitude error in the

cross-sections even for relatively mild ﬁelds.

Because of canonical importance of the TPDI of He, a number of theoretical methods have

been developed and applied to this problem recently. Among them are the so-called many-

electron many-photon theory [4, 5], the R-matrix Floquet approach [6], and various time-

dependent approaches [3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. These studies allowed to achieve considerable

progress in theoretical modelling of TDPI in helium. As far as total ionization cross section

(TICS) is concerned, the region of the photon energies from the threshold (38.5 eV) to 47 eV

is well understood. Various methods, such as the time-dependent close-coupling (TDCC)

approach [3, 13, 14] and the R-matrix Floquet method [6], gave results which lie suﬃciently

close to each other, and which indicate that in this region of the photon energies TICS is

a monotonously growing function of the energy. In Ref. [15] the presence of a maximum of

TICS in the vicinity of 42 eV was reported. For larger energies, the authors found that TICS

starts decaying monotonously. Overall shape of TICS, as a function of the photon energy,

was found to be very similar to that of single-photon double ionization. However, this ﬁnding

contradicts to other reports which indicated no maximum anywhere below 47 eV.

In the present work, we report the behavior of TICS of TPDI of helium at larger energies

from 47 to 50 eV. This photon energy range seems to be unexplored up to now. Our results

indicate that TICS continues to grow in this region of energies.

As a computational tool, we used a method which we proposed recently for single photon

double ionization studies [16]. The method is based on a numerical integration of the time-

dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) with subsequent projection of the solution on a set

of the ﬁeld-free ﬁnal states of the helium atom with both electrons in continuum. Accurate

description of these states is by itself a rather complicated problem.

In Refs. [17, 18],

inter-electron correlations in the ﬁnal state was taken into account perturbatively. One can

also address this problem using the exterior complex scaling method [19, 20, 21] or using

the complex Sturmian basis [22]. The hyperspherical R-matrix method with semiclassical

outgoing waves [23] and various implementations of the close-coupling method [14, 24, 25, 26]

were also used.

In our earlier work [16], we proposed to use the so-called convergent close-coupling (CCC)

expansion [27] to describe the ﬁeld-free two-electron continuum in conjunction with solution

of TDSE. In that paper we considered eﬀect of the external DC electric ﬁeld on the single-

photon double-electron ionization cross section. In the present work, we apply this method

for the study of two-photon double electron ionization of helium.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we give an outline of the theoretical

procedure. Then we discuss the results we obtained for the integrated and fully diﬀerential

cross sections of TPDI of helium.

II. THEORY.

Detailed description of our method can be found in Ref. [16]. We shall present here only

a brief description of the computational procedure. At the ﬁrst step we solve numerically

the TDSE for the helium atom in the presence of the external ac ﬁeld:

where:

where the non-interacting Hamiltonian and the Coulomb interaction are, respectively,

i ∂Ψ/∂t = ˆHΨ,

ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆV12 + ˆHint(t),

The interaction with the external ac ﬁeld is written in the length gauge:

ˆV12 =

1
|r1 − r2|

.

ˆHint(t) = f (t)(r1 + r2) · Fac cos ωt

Here f (t) is a smooth switching function which is chosen in such a way that the amplitude

of the ﬁeld remains constant during the time interval (T, 4T ), where T = 2π/ω is a period

of the ac ﬁeld. This ﬁeld is ramped on and oﬀ smoothly over one ac ﬁeld period. The total

duration of the atom-ﬁeld interaction is therefore T1 = 6T .

The solution of the TDSE is sought in the form of expansion on a square-integrable basis

Ψ(r1, r2, t) =

aj(t)fj(r1, r2).

are the so-called pseudostates obtained by diagonalizing the He+ Hamiltonian in a Laguerre

n′l′i = Eiδnn′δll′

In the present work, we consider electric ﬁeld of the order of 0.1 a.u. corresponding to

3.5 × 1014 W/cm2 intensity. For this, not very high intensity, we can retain in the expansion

(6) only the terms with total angular momentum J = 0 − 2. To represent each total angular

momentum block, we proceed as follows. For all S, P , D total angular momentum states

we let l1, l2 vary within the limits 0 − 3. The total number of pseudostates participating

in building the basis states was 20 for each l. To represent J = 0, 1, 2 singlet states in

expansion (6), we used all possible combinations of these pseudostates. Such a choice gave

us 840 basis states of S-symmetry, 1200 basis states of P -symmetry and 1430 states of D-

symmetry, resulting in a total dimension of the basis equal to 3470. Issues related to the

convergence of the calculation with respect to the variations of the composition of the basis

set are described in details in Ref. [16]. A separate calculation in which we added a subset

4

of 20 pseudostates with l = 4 produced only a minor change (of an order of a percent) for

the ionization probabilities.

Initial conditions for the solution of TDSE are determined by solving an eigenvalue prob-

lem using a subset of basis functions of the S-symmetry only. This produced the ground

state energy of -2.90330 a.u. We integrate TDSE up to a time T1 when the external ﬁeld is

switched oﬀ. Then we project the solution onto a ﬁeld-free CCC wave functions Ψ(k1, k2)

representing two electrons in continuum. Details of the construction of these functions can

be found, for example, in Ref. [26], or in our earlier paper [16].

A set

of

the ﬁnal

states

corresponding

to various photo-electron energies

E1, E2 was prepared.

The energies E1 and E2 were taken on a grid Ei =

1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 27, 40, 100, 200 eV. Projection of the solution of the TDSE on the

states of this grid gives us a probability distribution function p(k1, k2) of ﬁnding the helium

atom in a ﬁeld-free two-electron continuum state (k1, k2) at the time t = T1.

From this probability, we can compute various diﬀerential and the total integrated cross-

sections of TPDI. The fully resolved, with respect to the photoelectron angles and their

energy, triply diﬀerential cross-section (TDCS) is deﬁned as

III. RESULTS.

There are two TPDI channels with electrons escaping into the S and D continua.

In

the present paper, we are able to report only results for the D-channel as we do not reach

5

satisfactory accuracy for the S-channel. The reason for this lies in the fact that the ﬁnal

state CCC wave functions in the S-channel are not completely orthogonal to the ground

state wave function. These two sets of wave functions are obtained using two completely

unrelated procedures. The initial ground 1S state may have, therefore, a nonzero overlap

with the ﬁnal state CCC wave function which, after propagation in time, may aﬀect the

S-channel TPDI results. Since the S-channel contribution to TPDI is generally a small

number, this initial non-zero overlap can produce considerable inaccuracy in the calculation

of the S-wave ionization.

Present results for ionization into the D-channel can be utilized in a two-fold manner.

We can either consider them as the exact results for TPDI in a circular polarized ac ﬁeld.

In this case, only the D-wave contributes as the S-wave cannot accommodate two units of

angular momentum projection acquired after absorbing two circularly polarized photons.

Alternatively, we can rely on the fact that the S-wave contribution to TPDI is generally

small. Thus, with some caution, we can apply the present results to linearly polarized ac

ﬁeld as well. To check the accuracy of our method for the D-wave, we have in our disposal

the wealth of literature results for the region of photon energies from 42 to 47 eV, which has

been thoroughly studied.

A. Total integrated cross-section

Before presenting our numerical TICS results across the studied photon energy range, we

wish to outline the procedure we use to attest the accuracy of our calculation. Consider the

time-evolution of the helium atom in the absence of the ac external ﬁeld. This evolution

can be presented as a sum

Ψ(t) =

ck exp−iEkt Ψk,

X

(11)

where Ψk and Ek are solutions of the eigenvalue problem for the ﬁeld-free helium Hamiltonian

on the basis (7). The eigenvectors Ψk are not strictly orthogonal to the CCC ﬁeld-free states.

The overlap of the solution of the TDSE and the CCC state will therefore contain terms

ck exp−iEkthΨCCC|Ψki. These terms introduce beats in the computed probabilities which

X
may aﬀect the accuracy of the calculation considerably unless the overlaps hΨCCC|Ψki peak

6

in a narrow range of energies Ek. The magnitude of these beats may serve as an indicator

of the accuracy of the calculation.

This point is illustrated in Figure 1 where we plot the squared overlaps |hΨCCC|Ψki|2

between various D-symmetry eiegenfunctions of the eigenvalue problem for the ﬁeld-free

helium Hamiltonian on the basis (7) and a ﬁnal state CCC wave function at the excess

energy of 20 eV above the double ionization threshold. We see that indeed there are only few

leading overlaps which peak narrowly around this energy and other overlaps are insigniﬁcant

on this scale.

FIG. 1: Squared overlaps |hΨCCC|Ψki|2 between various D-symmetry eiegenfunctions of the eigen-

value problem for the ﬁeld-free helium Hamiltonian on the basis (7) and a CCC wave function at

the excess energy of 20 eV above the double ionization threshold.

Narrow localization of the overlaps on the energy scale dampens the beats considerably.

This is illustrated in the Table I where we present three sets of TICS computed for several

selected photon energies. These sets are obtained as follows. The ﬁrst set of TICS (second

column) is computed by overlapping the solution of the TDSE and the CCC wave functions

at the time T2 = T1 = 6T when the ac ﬁeld is switched oﬀ. To obtain the second set of data

(third column), we let the atom evolve freely for one period after the ac ﬁeld is switched oﬀ

and then the overlaps with the CCC ﬁeld free states are computed at the moment T2 = 7T .

sets.

The last set of TICS (the fourth column) is obtained when the system evolves freely for two

periods of the ac ﬁeld after it is switched oﬀ and the overlaps are computed at the moment

T2 = 8T . As one can see from these data, the beats mentioned above lead to variations of

TICS of the order of 20 percent for the photon energy range covered in the Table. We can

adopt this ﬁgure as an estimate of the accuracy of the present calculation.

For energies outside this range, results are ﬂuctuating much more and, hence, are consid-

erably less accurate. This can probably be explained if we recall the observation we made

above about the nature of the beats in the computed probabilities. Their magnitude is

determined eventually by the spectrum of the eigenvalue problem for the ﬁeld-free helium

Hamiltonian in the basis (7) and the set of CCC ﬁnal state wave functions we use. Proceed-

ing further into a domain of larger frequencies probably requires additional tuning of both

In Figure 1, we present our results for TICS in the whole photon energy range from 42 to

50 eV studied in the paper. The “error bars” attached to our data indicate the ﬂuctuation

of TICS due to free propagation beats.

In Figure 1, we compare the present calculation

with known literature values obtained by the following methods: TDCC [3, 13], R-matrix

[6] and TD-basis [8]. Within the stated accuracy of 20%, our results agree with the R-matrix

and TD-basis calculations. The TDCC calculations of Refs. [3] and [13] diﬀer between each

other because two diﬀerent shapes of the ﬁeld pulse are utilized in these works: a constant

amplitude pulse which is ramped on and oﬀ smoothly over one ﬁeld period and a sine squared

envelope, respectively. In the present calculation we employed a constant amplitude pulse

and therefore our results should be compared with Ref. [3] which reported the TICS of

results obtained by combination of the TDSE and CCC methods and corresponding to the ﬁeld

cm4s which should further increase when the S-wave is accounted for.

B. Fully diﬀerential cross-section

In Figure 3, we present our results for the fully resolved TDCS of TPDI of He at the

photon energy of 42 eV and the equal energy sharing between two photoelectrons E1 = E2 =

2.5 eV. We adopt the coplanar geometry in which the momenta of the two photoelectrons

and the polarization vector of light belong to the same plane which is perpendicular to the

propagation direction of the photon. We compare the present TDSE results with our earlier

CCC calculation in the closure approximation [28]. We also present in the ﬁgure the TDCC

results of Hu et al. [13] who gave in their work separate contributions of the D and S-waves

to TDCS. To make a shape comparison, we divide the present calculation by the same factor

9

of 1.3 for all ﬁxed electron angles. This factor reﬂects the diﬀerence in TICS between the two

methods. We remind the reader that the TDCC calculation of Hu et al. [13] is performed

with a sine squared envelope and their TICS are smaller than the present TDSE calculation.

There is a fair shape agreement between the three sets of calculations except for θ1 = 60◦

where the relative intensity of two major peaks is reversed between TDSE and TDCC. The

CCC calculation in the closure approximation is somewhat in between the two other results.

IV. CONCLUSION.

In the present work, we studied two-photon double electron ionization of helium in the

range of photon energies from 42 to 50 eV. The domain of energies from 42 to 47 eV has been

studied extensively before and there is an abundance of theoretical results in the literature

both for the total and, to lesser extent, diﬀerential cross-sections. Our present calculations,

both for TICS and TDCS, agree reasonably well with these results. Our TICS values lie

on the higher end of the set of data presented in Figure 2. As we noted above, this may

be, at least partially, explained by the particular pulse shape adopted in the present work.

More interesting, perhaps, is the monotonous growth of TICS with the photon energy which

we established for energies below 50 eV. Most probably, this feature will be present for any

pulse shape. We may expect some unusual features to appear in TICS for photon energies

approaching the threshold of sequential TPDI at 54.5 eV. It was shown in Refs. [17, 29]

that the spectrum of emitted electrons undergoes qualitative reconstruction when the new

mechanism opens up. This reconstruction may leave its trace in some additional feature of

TICS. We are going to explore this new regime in the future. We also intend to resolve the

issue of orthogonality and to evaluate the S-wave contribution to TPDI.

The presently analyzed fully diﬀerential cross-sections (TDCS) agree very well between

the two CCC calculations: the non-perturbative TDSE and the perturbative closure.

In

these two models, we employ the same CCC ﬁnal state whereas theoretical description of

the ﬁeld interaction with the atom is diﬀerent. The fact that the diﬀerential cross-sections

are similar in these two calculations indicates that the energy and angular correlation in the

two-electron continuum is established as the result of the electron correlation in the ﬁnal

doubly ionized state. It shows little sensitivity to the precise mechanism of the atom-ﬁeld

interaction.

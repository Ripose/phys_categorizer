Abstract

The Hamiltonian of two interacting particles has a very simple form us-
ing the Discrete Variable Representation (DVR). For local interactions, the
potential energy matrix has a diagonal form and its diagonal elements are
the values of the potential at the DVR points. The particular form of the
potential energy matrix in the Discrete Variable Representation is obtained
performing a unitary transformation after replacing the integrals by quadra-
tures. The approximate treatment of the integrals has a consequence, that
is, the DVR results cannot be considered as variational. We will show that
the variational character of the results can be restored by performing a
reduced number of integrals.
In practice, for a variational description of
the lowest n bound states only n(n + 1)/2 integrals are necessary whereas
D(D + 1)/2 integrals are enough for scattering states (D is the dimension
of the S matrix). Applications of the method to the study of dimers of He,
Ne and Ar, for both bound and scattering states, will be presented.

Introduction

The solution of a quantum mechanical problem can be obtained using a
variational principle. It allows to obtain second order estimates of binding
energies and scattering matrices as well as the corresponding wave func-
tions. For bound states the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle can be used
whereas for scattering states, among others, the Kohn variational principle
(KVP) can be employed. A common procedure is to combine the varia-
tional principle with the expansion of the wave function onto a complete
basis. Following Ref.[1] we will refer to this method as the variational basis
representation (VBR). The accuracy of such a method is strictly connected
to the size of the basis set employed. In practical applications the basis set,
which in many cases is inﬁnite, is truncated.

For the speciﬁc case of bound state calculations, the implementation of
the VBR method leads to the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem
in which the Hamiltonian of the system has been represented as a matrix
of dimension equal to the size of the basis set employed. The corresponding
eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained by diagonalization represent upper
bounds to the exact energy levels of the Hamiltonian and ﬁrst order ap-
proximations to the associated wave functions. If N is the dimension of the
truncated basis, the Hylleras-Undheim theorem assures that

where ǫλ represents the exact eigenvalue of level λ. As there is no approxi-
mation in the calculation of the Hamiltonian matrix elements, the accuracy
of the VBR is directly related to the completeness of the basis employed.
Accordingly, by increasing the dimension of the basis it is possible to obtain
solutions extremely close to the exact one.

For scattering states the situation is slightly diﬀerent. The wave function
describing a scattering state is not an L2 function, however its form outside
the region where the collision takes place is in general known. Therefore,
the conﬁguration space can be divided in two regions: the asymptotic region
in which the particles are either free or interacting through a long range
(coulombic) potential, and the internal region. In the asymptotic region the
scattering wave function can be described in terms of Bessel or Coulomb
functions.
In the internal region the scattering state can be expanded in
a complete L2-basis. The linear coeﬃcients of the expansion and the S

1

matrix elements giving the relative weights between the ingoing and outgoing
asymptotic solutions, can be obtained from the KVP. The implementation of
the Kohn variational principle using a VBR leads to a two-steps procedure.
The ﬁrst step consists in obtaining a ﬁrst order estimate of the scattering
matrix S and wave function by solving a linear non-homogeneous system of
equations of dimension N + D, with D the dimension of the S matrix. The
S matrix second order estimate is obtained replacing the ﬁrst order solution
in the functional:

[Sαβ] = Sαβ + i < Ψ−

with H and E the Hamiltonian and energy of the system respectively. Sαβ
is the ﬁrst order estimate of the corresponding S matrix element and Ψ+
α
(Ψ−
β ) is the outgoing (ingoing) solution corresponding to channel α (β). The
convergence of the second order estimate of the S matrix elements can be
studied for increasing values of N . Though in this case there is no guarantee
of a monotonous convergence, as is the case for bound states, the properties
of the KVP have been extensively studied in past years [2].

The key hypothesis in the variational theorems when implemented with
the VBR method is that all the matrix elements required need to be cal-
culated exactly, or at least to a very good accuracy. This means that the
computational cost of the calculation increases as N 2. It is quite common
to choose orthogonal polynomials with appropriate weight functions as basis
sets, so that both norm and kinetic matrix elements are analytical, and the
only numerical integrations required are for the potential matrix elements.
A diﬀerent, but related technique, is the Discrete Variable Representa-
tion (DVR) which is widely used in the description of molecular systems.
Examples are the calculations of vibrational spectra, scattering problems or
photo-dissociation processes [3]. The DVR method is described in detail in a
recent review [4]. The basic property of the DVR is that local operators de-
pending on the inter-particle distance (including the potential) are diagonal
in the DVR basis. However, in the case of the potential matrix, the diagonal
form is a result of an approximate treatment of the integrals deﬁning the
corresponding matrix elements. For example, in the case of a N dimensional
basis of orthogonal polynomials multiplied by appropriate weight functions,
the approximation consists in replacing the integrals by the related N point
Gaussian quadrature formula. In the limit of N going to inﬁnity, both the
VBR and DVR approximations for the energy levels converge to the exact
solutions. The advantage of the DVR with respect to the VBR is that there
is no need to compute N 2 integrals, and the price to pay is the loss of the
variational character of the calculated eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

2

In the present paper we would like to investigate the possibility of pro-
ducing variational bounds using the DVR method. For bound states we
proceed as follows. The solution of a N dimensional DVR problem consists
and the corresponding N eigenvectors ψDVR
in N eigenvalues EDVR
. The
lowest eigenvalue EDVR
is an approximation to the exact ground state ǫ0.
Due to the loss of the variational character, EDVR
could be either greater
or smaller than ǫ0 and this ambiguity remains even for large values of N .
However the quantity

is an upper bound to ǫ0 provided that the above integral is calculated accu-
rately. To this aim, the ψDVR
wave function, which is known in the DVR
basis, that is as amplitudes at the DVR points, has to be transformed to
the r-space. As a result, only one numerical integral needs to be evaluated
in order to obtain an upper bound to the ground state energy. As we will
see this procedure can be extended to produce upper bounds to the lowest n
levels belonging to a band of the exact Hamiltonian. In this case a minimum
of n(n + 1)/2 integrals have to be computed. In general the number N of
basis functions necessary to describe correctly the ﬁrst n states of a band
veriﬁes N >> n, so that the number of integrals to be performed in order
to produce variational bounds is much smaller than those needed within the
VBR. In cases where it is possible to obtain good solutions with N
n,
the alternatives to the VBR method, as the one here presented, have not
a particular advantage since the basis functions used to expand the wave
functions are already close to the exact solutions.

≈

For scattering states a similar procedure can be followed. If SDVR is the
ﬁrst order estimate of the S matrix element calculated from the KVP using
the DVR technique, and ψDVR is the corresponding scattering state, we can
use eq. (3) to calculate the second order estimate of the S matrix element.
In order to produce a true variational estimate, the integral of eq. (3) must
be calculated very accurately. This can be achieved again by transforming
the DVR solution to the r-space and performing the integral using a dense
grid. In this manner we have obtained a variational estimate of the S-matrix
elements computing D(D + 1)/2 numerical integrals, with D the dimension
of the S-matrix. In most cases D is much smaller than the dimension of the
basis N .

In order to show the application of the above formalism, we have studied
dimers formed by two equal rare gas atoms. The spectrum of small clusters
of He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe has been subject of recent investigations (see
Ref. [5] and references therein). In particular, the study of the Helium dimer

3

has proved very challenging, due to the extraordinary features of the He-He
interaction, that makes the He2 molecule very elusive [6]. Diﬃculties in the
theoretical study of rare gas clusters arise from the characteristics of the
atom-atom interaction, whose attractive part is of the van der Waals type
and its short range part presents a hard repulsive core, making those systems
strongly correlated. As a result, the rotational-vibrational spectrum of these
dimers diﬀers substantially from the spectrum of typical covalent or polar
molecules. The helium dimer has only one vibrational state, no rotational
spectrum, and its binding energy is about seven orders of magnitude smaller
than the one of traditional molecules. Some potential models predict for the
Ne and Ar dimers three and nine vibrational states, respectively, however
only some of them have been observed. When the VBR is used to describe
the bound states of these dimers an elevate number of basis functions is
required to account for the strong atom-atom correlation. On the other
hand the limited number of bound states makes the van der Waals dimers
well suited for applications of the method outlined here. We have studied
the dimers He2, Ne2 and Ar2 with state-of-the-art atom-atom potentials.
In Section II we outline the method for applications to bound states. The
patterns of convergence for the energies of diﬀerent states, as well as for other
observables, are shown for comparison. In Section III we present results for
the scattering lengths and low energy phase-shifts. Section IV is devoted to
the conclusions.

where M is the atomic mass and V (r) represents the interaction. In order to
implement the VBR method we introduce the orthonormal basis Φklm(r) =

to a family of orthogonal polynomials, veriﬁes

For sake of clarity, and without loss of generality, we can limit the discussion
to l = 0 states and call the corresponding radial basis elements φk (k =
0, 1, . . .). The radial part of the wave function corresponding to the level λ

the notation.

With an appropriate choice of the basis set, the integrals corresponding
to the kinetic energy elements Kkk′ can be obtained analytically whereas,
in general, the integrals corresponding to the potential energy elements Vkk′
are calculated performing numerical integrations. As mentioned in the in-
troduction, the accuracy of the numerical integration should be high enough
to prevent round oﬀ errors in the eigenvalues of the matrix representation of
H. This will fulﬁll the hypotheses of the variational theorem and assure a
convergence from above to the exact eigenvalues as the dimension N of the
matrix increases. In the present work we use a very dense grid in the variable
r together with a seven point Lagrange integration formula. The relative
accuracy in the computation of the potential energy elements is better than
10−7.

Alternatively, the DVR oﬀers a computationally more eﬃcient method
to obtain good estimates for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of H. In the
following we brieﬂy introduce the DVR for a basis of N orthogonal polyno-
mials times the appropriate weight functions [1]. In this case a one-to-one

5

correspondence exists between the basis representation and the representa-
tion in N Gaussian quadrature points, however the method is not limited
to this case [1, 7]. The DVR corresponding to the set of N basis functions
φk can be obtained from the following unitary matrix

The DVR kinetic energy is given similarly as K DVR = T tKT , where K is

using an N points quadrature formula, whereas in H DVR = K DVR + V DVR

in several cases the energies EDVR
oscillate around the converged value ǫλ.
In order to obtain variational estimates, we apply the variational principle
to the set n of DVR eigenvectors ψDVR
(r), i = 1, ..., n, which approximate
the n lowest levels of a band of the exact H. In this paper we will discuss
the case l = 0, however the method given below can be applied as well to
other bands. We can build the n

In fact, whereas Eλ(N ) is the VBR eigenvalue calculated using N basis

Eλ(n) is the eigenvalue calculated using n speciﬁc combinations
of the N basis functions and therefore it has been obtained in a reduced
Hilbert space. This procedure to generate variational bounds allows for a
noticeable gain in computational time with respect to the VBR when the

restriction, but in many cases it holds. For weakly bound molecules, as
dimers of rare gases, the number of bound states is not very high. On the
other hand, for system with a very high number of bound states, the number
of levels which are well approximate using N basis functions is in general
smaller than N .

In order to show applications of the above formalism we will calculate
bound states of dimers of He, Ne and Ar. For the He-He and Ne-Ne interac-
tions we use the LM2M2 potential and the HFD-B potential, respectively,
both proposed by Aziz and Slaman [9, 10]. For the Ar-Ar system we use
the HFD-C potential proposed by Aziz [11]. The values ¯h2/M = 43.281307,
8.584089 and 4.336093 K a2
0 have been used for the He, Ne and Ar systems,
respectively. With our choice of the inter-atomic potentials, and of the val-
ues for the atomic mass, the number of vibrational states supported is one
for He2, three for Ne2, and nine for Ar2. The corresponding energy values
are given in Table I.

As radial basis functions we have used the following orthonormal basis

In ﬁgure 2 the patterns of convergence of the energy are shown for four
selected vibrational states of Ar2 and Ne2, as a function of the number of
DVR points N . For Ne2 the HFD-B potential predicts three bound states,
however the highest excited state is very loosely bound and has been initially
excluded from the analysis. Therefore the wave functions ψDVR
(λ = 0, 1)
has been used to calculate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian as deﬁned
in eq. (19). Accordingly an eigenvalue problem of dimension n = 2 has been
solved. For Ar2 the HFD-C potential predicts nine bound states, but again
the highest excited state has been initially excluded, therefore an eigenvalue
problem of dimension n = 8 has been solved. We have obtained a good
convergence for all the state analyzed for both molecules, but for clarity here
we limit the ﬁgure to show the energies corresponding to the ground states
of the two molecules, the ﬁrst excited state of Ne2, and the eighth level of
Ar2. The pattern of convergence of these states present some particularities
that are interesting to discuss. As expected the VBR has a very stable
convergence in all cases. The DVR energies approach the VBR result with a
very fast convergence showing some oscillations with decreasing amplitudes
as N increases. Though the DVR results are qualitatively similar in the

variational principle since the relation of eq. (20) is veriﬁed for each value of
N . Moreover these oscillations are a consequence of the loss of variational
character of the DVR wave functions since in many cases we found that the
N + 1 result is worst than the N result.

method as it requires n′ consistently bigger than n in

order to have a smooth pattern of convergence. However, we observe that
there is a signiﬁcant improvement in the convergence pattern with choices of
n′ that still satisfy the important condition n′

scattering states of two particles using VBR and
DVR

In order to produce variational estimates for the scattering matrix using
the DVR method we will use the Kohn variational principle in its general
form [2]. Here we give a brief introduction to the method, limited to the
case of local central potentials. Without loss of generality, we will treat
speciﬁcally the case l = 0 and the case in which the collision proceeds along
one open channel. In this case the scattering matrix is a scalar quantity.
The formalism can be easily generalized to treat more channels and the case
in which the long range Coulomb potential is present [12].

The radial scattering wave function corresponding to a process at energy

E can be written as a sum of two terms:

ψ+(r) = ψc(r) + ψ+

a (r) .

The ﬁrst term, ψc is the internal part and describes the system when the
two particles are close to each other. It can be expanded in terms of N L2

The convergence properties of the KVP variational principle have been
extensively studied [13, 14]. Occasionally singularities appear in its solution,
however the complex form (

convergence. Here we will use both forms and check the consistency of the
results with the relation

order) for the Ne-Ne system (a) and Ar-Ar system (b). The converged values

a very dense r grid has been used. Here we do not want to discuss the
convergence properties of the KVP, that can be found in Refs. [13, 14].

considered, which is the same order of magnitude of the diﬀerences between
the results using
S. From the table we can see that the DVRq
phase shifts has a slower pattern of convergence in all cases. For the He-He
system we have seen that at zero energy the DVRq result is not stable even
at high N values. At 50 mK the situation is slightly improved though the
pattern of convergence of DVRq is still not satisfactory. For Ne and Ar we
observe that big values of N are necessary to obtain stable results. This is
a consequence of the presence of excited states close to the threshold that
in general are diﬃcult to describe, in particular the E8 state of Ar.

In ﬁgure 7 we compare the quantity q/tan δ (ﬁlled circles) to the r.h.s
of eq. (58) calculated using the zero energy results (solid line). From this
plot it is possible to evaluate the energy at which the phase shift starts to
deviate from a linear relation. Below this energy the collision is not very
sensitive to the details of the potential since the dynamics is governed by two
parameters, the scattering length and the eﬀective range. Above this energy
more sensitivity to the potential appears. For the He system the deviation
appears around E = 0.1 K whereas for Ne appears around E = 0.05 K and
around E = 0.002 K for Ar.

4 Conclusions

In the present paper we have studied the possibility of using DVR wave
functions to produce variational estimates to binding energies and scattering
matrices. The main advantage in using the DVR in the description of a
quantum mechanical problem is the simplicity to construct the Hamiltonian
matrix. However the DVR eigenvalues do not represent upper bounds to
the exact levels. Therefore, in order to extract estimates to the levels, it is
necessary to produce a convergence pattern in terms of the number N of
DVR points and analyze the stability of the results as N increases. In the
case of the He-He system we have seen that the DVR eigenvalue oscillates
around the exact level even for high values of N . Conversely, the variational
estimate obtained with the DVR wave function shows a better stability.
As a result, calculating only one integral, namely the mean value of the
Hamiltonian with the DVR ground state wave function, we have improved
the prediction of the DVR method.

In order to extend the discussion to excited states, we have studied
the Ne-Ne and Ar-Ar systems. We have shown that we need to perform
at least n(n + 1)/2 integrals to produce variational estimates to the ﬁrst n

18

levels. Although the variational estimates are always upper bounds, we have
noticed that, for some levels, they do not converge monotonically, presenting
instead oscillations. In order to improve this behavior we have considered a
variational problem with an enlarged number (n′) of DVR wave functions.
We have seen that with n′
2n we obtain patterns of convergence very close
to those obtained with the VBR. In the case in which the description includes
many excited states with a big spread in energy, we have found necessary
to increase further n′. Both n and n′ are in general much smaller than N ,
so the possibility to generate variational bounds using DVR is convenient in
computation eﬀort compared to the VBR.

≈

For scattering states the Kohn Variational Principle gives a natural con-
text to use the DVR wave function to calculate second order variational
estimates of the scattering matrix. The case of the He-He system at zero
energy is a good example. The ﬁrst order scattering length calculated us-
ing DVR oscillates around the exact value. The second order variational
estimate calculated using the DVR wave function has very fast convergence.
Conversely, the second order calculated using quadratures fails to reproduce
the correct value for N < 500. This is a consequence of the particular struc-
ture of the He-He interaction. For the Ne-Ne system the diﬀerences between
the second order calculated variationally or using quadratures is not so pro-
nounced as N increases. Conversely for the Ar-Ar system the second order
calculated using quadratures fails to converge even for values of N of the
order of 400. Perhaps this is the best example in which the application of
the KVP to correct the ﬁrst order estimate is clearly necessary. In general
we have observed that the scattering calculations need a bigger basis set to
obtain converged results. This is a consequence of the two excited states
close to zero energy that the Ne-Ne and the Ar-Ar interactions predict.

Finally we would like to mention the possibility to extend the present
study to the three-body problem. In this case the dimension of the matrices
needed for the description are much bigger. So the capability to produce
patterns of convergence in terms of N could be limited. Hence, variational
estimates as those presented here could help to improve the DVR predic-
tions. A study on this subject is at present underway.

(a), the ﬁrst excited vibrational state of Ne2 (b), and the eighth level of Ar2
(c), for diﬀerent choices of the size n′ of the restricted variational problem of
eq. (19). For Ne2 the lines correspond to n′ = 4 (solid), n′ = 8 (dashed) and
n′ = 12 (dotted-dashed). For Ar2 the lines correspond to n′ = 12 (solid),
n′ = 20 (dashed) and n′ = 30 (dotted-dashed). As a reference the VBR
results are shown as a dotted line.

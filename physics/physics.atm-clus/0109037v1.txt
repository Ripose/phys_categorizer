of simple metal clusters

We use a perturbative semiclassical trace formula to cal-
culate the three lowest-order multipole (quadrupole ǫ2, oc-
tupole ǫ3, and hexadecapole ǫ4) deformations of simple metal
clusters with 90 ≤ N ≤ 550 atoms in their ground states.
The self-consistent mean ﬁeld of the valence electrons is mod-
eled by an axially deformed cavity and the oscillating part of
the total energy is calculated semiclassically using the short-
est periodic orbits. The average energy is obtained from a
liquid-drop model adjusted to the empirical bulk and surface
properties of the sodium metal. We obtain good qualitative
agreement with the results of quantum-mechanical calcula-
tions using Strutinsky’s shell-correction method.

Free clusters made of simple metal atoms exhibit a pro-
nounced electronic shell structure [1–3]. Although the
detailed experimental information obtained, e.g., from
photo-excitation measurements can only be understood
if the ionic structure is taken into account [4], the quali-
tative features of the electronic shell structure can be well
grasped by using the phenomenological deformed shell-
model potentials [5–7]. Self-consistent density functional
calculations performed in the framework of a deformed
jellium model [8] have revealed that the cluster ground-
state shapes can be well characterized in terms of the low-
est three multipole orders ǫ2 (quadrupole), ǫ3 (octupole),
and ǫ4 (hexadecapole). Since such self-consistent calcu-
lations are quite time consuming computationally, it is
often more eﬃcient to resort to simpler methods, such as
the shell-correction method introduced by Strutinsky in
nuclear physics [9], in particular, if more shape degrees
of freedom are to be investigated [7].

An even more economical approach is the semiclassi-
cal periodic orbit theory (POT) (see, e.g., Ref. [10] for
a general introduction), in which quantum oscillations in
the level density or other observables can be described in
terms of the leading shortest periodic orbits of the corre-
sponding classical system through so-called trace formu-
lae [11,12]. This method has been used for quadrupole-
deformed clusters in a Nilsson-type model [13] and, more
recently, using cavities with axial ǫ2, ǫ3, and ǫ4 deforma-
tions [14,15]. The approximation of the self-consistent
mean ﬁeld of the valence electrons by a cavity with re-
ﬂecting walls has received strong support from the quan-
titative explanation [14] of the experimental magic num-
bers found in connection with the electronic supershells
[16] in terms of the trace formula of the spherical cavity

[12]. In Ref. [15], a perturbative trace formula developed
by Creagh [17] has been used for axially deformed cavi-
ties with small multipole deformations ǫ2, ǫ3, or ǫ4 and
found to reproduce the quantum-mechanical results very
well for moderate values of the deformation parameters.
In the present work we extend the approach given
in Ref. [15]. As there, the mean ﬁeld of the electrons
is parametrized by an axial cavity whose surface is de-
scribed in terms of the Legendre polynomials Pj by

R(θ) = R

1 + ǫ0 +

ǫjPj(cos θ)

,

(1)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

Xj=2

where R = rvN 1/3 is the radius of the spherical cavity
and ǫ0 is used to keep its volume constant. In contrast
to Ref. [15], here we include simultaneously all the three
deformation parameters (def ) = (ǫ2, ǫ3, ǫ4) and minimize
for each N the total energy

Etot(def ) = ELDM (def ) + δE(def )

(2)

in order to determine the ground state deformation.
Here, ELDM is the average total energy obtained in the
liquid drop model (LDM) and δE is the shell-correction
energy. For the LDM model parameters and the ra-
dius constant rv we use the same values as in Ref. [7].
We evaluate δE both quantum-mechanically using the
Strutinsky method, and semiclassically by the perturba-
tive trace formula discussed in Ref. [15]. The periodic
orbits hereby are those of the spherical cavity, discussed
by Balian and Bloch [12] and characterized by the wind-
ing number t (number of revolutions around the centre)
and the number p of reﬂections from the boundary. We
refer to Ref. [15] for the deﬁnition of the modulation fac-
tor included in the perturbative trace formula for the
oscillating part of the level density δgsc(E) and for the
calculation of the quantum-mechanical energy spectrum
by a method based on Ref. [18]. When admitting several
types of deformations ǫj simultaneously, the correspond-
ing ﬁrst-order changes of the classical actions ∆Sj have
to be added up in the exponent of the integrand for the
modulation factor. The energy shell-correction δEsc is
then obtained using the relation

δEsc =

largest deformations agree within about 10% - 20%, in
spite of the fact that for these deformations the argu-
ment of the modulation factor in the trace formula is
larger than unity. A particularly nice result is the correct
reproduction of the systematics of octupole deformations
ǫ3 which only occur in the lowest part of each shell, as al-
ready noticed in Ref. [7]. In addition, the systematic sign
change in the hexadecapole deformations ǫ4 from positive
to negative within each shell is reproduced qualitatively,
although the negative values turn out to be systemati-
cally too small in the semiclassical results. This defect
may be connected to the fact that for larger negative hex-
adecapole deformations the, the cluster shape becomes a
multi-valued function in the cylindrical coordinates.

For the latter two, the energy was minimized for each N with
respect to the three multipole deformations ǫ2, ǫ3, and ǫ4.

In Fig. 1 we present the resulting deformation energies
Edef (def ) = Etot(def ) − ELDM (0), plotted as functions
of the particle number N in the region of 90 ≤ N ≤ 200.
The dotted line is the quantum-mechanical Strutinsky re-
sult for spherical shapes and exhibits three typical shell
closures at the magic numbers N = 92, 138, and 186. The
solid line is the quantum-mechanical Strutinsky result,
minimized for each N with respect to the three multipole
deformations ǫ2, ǫ3, and ǫ4. The dashed line is the result
of the semiclassical calculation including periodic orbits
with a maximum of tm = 3 repetitions and pm = 30 re-
ﬂections at the boundary. We see how the inclusion of
deformations reduces the total energy drastically, except
for the narrow regions around the magic numbers. We
also notice a very good agreement of our semiclassical
results with the quantum results, showing that the per-
turbative trace formula works reasonably well even for
the largest deformations.

In Fig. 2, we present the three ground-state deforma-
tions ǫ2, ǫ3, and ǫ4, obtained by the energy minimiza-
tion procedure, as functions of N . The solid lines are
the quantum-mechanical results, and the dashed lines are
the semiclassical results. The agreement is excellent in
view of the fact that we cannot expect the semiclassi-
cal approximation to be exact. In particular, even the

The convergence of the semiclassical results with re-
spect to the lengths of the included periodic orbits is
demonstrated in Fig. 3. Here the diﬀerent lines show the
values of the ground-state deformations obtained with
the maximum winding number tm and reﬂection num-
ber pm chosen as (tm, pm) = (1,10) and (3,30), respec-
tively, whereas the crosses correspond to the quantum-
mechanical results. We clearly see that a slight improve-
ment is obtained by including the second (t = 2) and
third (t = 3) repetitions (harmonics) and the correspond-
ing numbers of reﬂections.

become less distinct for the larger clusters where the su-
pershells start to decrease in amplitude.

Owing to the eﬃciency of our method, the calculation
of two- (or higher-) dimensional deformation energies be-
comes quite economic numerically. As examples, we show
in Figs. 6 and 7 two-dimensional deformation energy sur-
faces of Na162 and Na180, respectively. The deforma-
tion energy Edef is plotted versus quadrupole (ǫ2) and
hexadecapole (ǫ4) deformations. The upper parts give
the quantum-mechanical results and the lower parts the
semiclassical ones. We see that our semiclassical method
captures the correct overall behaviour of the topology of
the quantum-mechanical deformation energy landscape,
thus being able to reproduce the most prominent isomeric
minima correctly.

In summary, we have shown that the perturbative
semiclassical POT is an eﬃcient and reliable tool for the
calculation of ground-state deformations of metal clus-
ters, or of any other system of fermions whose mean ﬁeld
can be approximated by a cavity with reﬂecting walls.
This holds also for atomic nuclei [19], apart from modiﬁ-
cations due to the spin-orbit interaction whose inclusion
in the POT is presently an object of intensive research
[20,21].

Density-functional simulations have been performed on Na55, Na92 and Na142 clusters in order
to understand the experimentally observed melting properties [M. Schmidt et al., Nature (London)
393, 238 (1998)]. The calculated melting temperatures are in excellent agreement with the exper-
imental ones. The calculations reveal a rather subtle interplay between geometric and electronic
shell eﬀects, and bring out the fact that the quantum mechanical description of the system is crucial
for understanding the variation in melting temperatures observed experimentally.

There is currently great interest in the statistical me-
chanics of ﬁnite-sized versions of systems that display
phase transitions in the inﬁnite-size limit. Recently,
atomic clusters have provided an example of a ﬁnite
system whose caloric curve may be measured, yielding
evidence for a “melting” transition over a broad range
of temperatures [1, 2, 3, 4]. The clusters involved in
these experiments were both small (containing from a
few atoms to several hundreds of atoms) and free (not
supported on a surface). Now, according to old thermo-
dynamic models [5, 6], a small particle should melt at a
lower temperature than the bulk because of the eﬀect of
the surface, with the reduction in melting temperature
being roughly proportional to 1/R, where R is the radius
of the particle. This eﬀect has been veriﬁed quantita-
tively for particles of mesoscopic size (upwards of several
thousand atoms) supported on a surface [6, 7]. More
recently, however, in a series of experiments on free Na
clusters in the size range 55 to 350, Haberland and co-
workers [1, 2, 3] found that the simple 1/R scaling is lost;
they did observe a substantial lowering (by about 30%) of
the melting temperature compared to bulk sodium, but
accompanied by rather large size-dependent ﬂuctuations
in the melting temperatures. In spite of considerable the-
oretical eﬀort [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], the precise form of
the observed ﬂuctuations remains unexplained to date.

As is well known, metallic clusters (such as sodium)
possess the same ﬁrst few “magic” sizes as atomic nu-
clei, N = 2, 8, 20, . . .
[14], corresponding to partic-
ularly stable systems in which the delocalized valence
electrons form closed fermionic shells. Unlike nuclei,
however, metallic clusters also contain positively charged
ions, which are much heavier than electrons and may be
treated classically to a good approximation, leading to
the possibility that geometric packing eﬀects may enter
into competition with electronic shell eﬀects in determin-
ing certain properties. The precise pattern of melting
points observed experimentally [1, 3] shows maxima at

sizes that correspond neither to magic numbers of va-
lence electrons nor to complete Mackay icosahedra of
ions, thereby suggesting a subtle interplay between ge-
ometric and quantum electronic eﬀects [1, 3, 8, 9].

Reliable simulations to determine the melting prop-
erties of clusters are made diﬃcult by a combination
of two crucial requirements: the need to compute the
ionic potential-energy surface accurately, and the need
for high statistics to converge the features in the caloric
curve. Good statistics have been obtained using a va-
riety of parametrized interatomic potentials [9, 10], as
well as with a treatment of the valence electrons in the
extended Thomas-Fermi (ETF) [11] and related density-
based (DB) approximations [12, 15]. But these attempts
have failed to reproduce crucial features of the experi-
mental results, such as the precise pattern of observed
melting temperatures. An interesting observation is that
in all earlier simulations the melting temperature of Na55
has been considerably underestimated (by about 100 K
lower than the experimental value).

Clearly, what is required is a more realistic treatment
in particular, one that incor-
of interacting electrons,
porates correctly electronic shell eﬀects, which are ex-
plicitly excluded from the above-mentioned work using
parametrized, ETF, or DB potentials. We have recently
demonstrated the power of ab initio density functional
theory (DFT), in the Kohn-Sham (KS) formulation, for
simulating the melting properties of small Sn [16] and
Ga [17] clusters in the size range 10−20. Unfortunately,
the computational expense of the KS approach, com-
bined with the relatively large sizes of the Na data (N =
55−350), have so far made it diﬃcult to perform KS sim-
ulations with high statistics in the size range of the ex-
+ [8, 9], per-
periment. Recently, a KS simulation of Na55
formed with limited statistics, shows encouraging results,
with an estimated melting temperature Tm between 300
and 350 K [Tm(expt) ≈ 290 K for Na55

+].

In this Letter, we report the ﬁrst ab initio KS ther-

2

temperatures at this level of accuracy or better. Analy-
sis of the structural and dynamical information in these
simulations sheds new light on the respective roles of ge-
ometric and electronic eﬀects in this intriguing problem.
Our simulations have been carried out using isokinetic
Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics with ultrasoft
pseudopotentials in the local density approximation, as
implemented in the vasp package [18]. We have carried
out calculations for up to 17 temperatures for Na55 and
14 temperatures for Na92 and Na142 in the temperature
range 100 to 500 K. The resulting trajectory data have
been used to compute the ionic speciﬁc heat, via a multi-
histogram ﬁt, as well as other thermodynamic indicators.
Further simulation details are discussed in Ref. [16].

We have carried out a substantial search for the
lowest-energy ionic structures. A basin-hopping al-
gorithm [19] was employed to generate several hun-
dred structures using the second-moment approximation
(SMA) parametrized potential of Li et al. [20]. Sev-
eral of these structures were then used as input for re-
laxation within the KS approach.
In addition, several
quenches were carried out for structures selected from a
long high-temperature ab initio MD run, typically taken
at a temperature well above the melting point (say, for
T > 400 K). The resulting lowest-energy structures found
for the three sizes are shown in Figs. 1(a)–1(c). The
lowest-energy geometry of Na55 was found to be a two-
shell Mackay icosahedron (with a very slight distortion
from perfect regularity), in conformity with previous the-
ory [8, 21] and experimental evidence [22]. Na142 is also
found to be icosahedral, with 5 atoms missing from the
outermost shell. (A three-shell Mackay icosahedron has
147 atoms.) As to Na92, the structure consists of surface
growth over a slightly distorted icosahedral Na55 core.
The additional 37 surface atoms are accommodated so
as to maintain a roughly spherical shape.

Next we examine the speciﬁc heat for the three clusters
investigated, which are plotted in Figs. 2(a)–2(c). These
curves feature a single dominant peak with a width vary-
ing from about 40 K for Na55 to about 20 K for Na142,
in general agreement with the experimental observation.
A detailed investigation of the ionic dynamics shows this
peak to correspond to a “melting-like” transition, from
a low-temperature solidlike state, in which ions vibrate
about ﬁxed points (and the cluster as a whole may ro-
tate), to a higher-temperature liquidlike state with a dif-
fusive ionic dynamics. As one illustration of this, we show
in Figs. 2(d)–2(f) the root-mean-square bond-length ﬂuc-
tuation δrms [23]. For each size there is a sharp step in
δrms that correlates closely with the peak in the speciﬁc
heat. The “melting” phenomenology found is qualita-
tively similar to that found in earlier studies with simpler
potentials [10, 11, 13].

The KS melting temperatures Tm are given along with
the approximate “latent heats” L in Table I. Following
the convention in the experimental works [1, 3], we de-

modynamic calculations up to size N = 142, within the
size range of the experiment. We present simulations for
NaN with N = 55, 92, and 142, each with total sampling
times of the order of 2–3 ns. For each size there is a
pronounced peak in speciﬁc-heat curve, whose position
agrees with the experimental ﬁnding to better than 8%.
This error is also the approximate level of statistical error
for the simulation times used, suggesting that a KS ap-
proach is capable of quantitative predictions of melting

ﬁne Tm here as the maximum of the peak in the speciﬁc
heat. We have also calculated a quantity δE deﬁned as
the average potential energy of the just melted cluster
with respect to the ground-state structure at T = 0 K.
Schmidt et al. [24] have inferred from the experimental
caloric curve that the melting temperature is inﬂuenced
by such an energy contribution. They showed further
that Tm follows closely the variation in δE as a function
of the cluster size. In Table I, we have also given Tm and
L calculated by the SMA parametrized potential [9, 10].
The striking feature of the results summarized in this ta-
ble is that only the ﬁrst principles KS-based calculations
reproduce, qualitatively as well as quantitatively, the ex-
perimentally observed variation in the melting tempera-
tures and the latent heat for the three clusters investi-
gated [25].

A noteworthy feature of the data in Table I is that Na92
melts at a signiﬁcantly lower temperature than Na142.
This is true both for the KS data, which include elec-
tronic shell eﬀects explicitly, and for the SMA, DB, and
ETF [11] data, which do not. We are thus led to conclude
that geometry plays a signiﬁcant role in the melting-point
depression of Na92: Na55 and Na142 are complete, or close
to complete, Mackay icosahedra, while Na92 has surface
growth on a two-shell icosahedral core and is less stable.
However, as we shall see, the electronic structure does
play a subtle role in the behavior of the melting temper-
atures of these clusters.

As mentioned earlier, previous simulations gave a melt-
ing temperature for Na55 signiﬁcantly lower than the ex-
perimental one, as well as that of Na142 within the same
model [26]. This discrepancy is largely removed within
the present KS model: we ﬁnd that Tm(55) ≈ Tm(142),
within statistical error, and that both melting tempera-
tures agree with experiment. This suggests that the high
melting point of Na55, relative to Na142, is due to elec-
tronic shell eﬀects, since these are the new element in the
KS approach not included in previous simulations. Both
Na55 and Na142 are close to “magic” systems (Na58 and
Na138, respectively), but shell eﬀects are relatively more
important for smaller systems [27], which could lead to
a relative enhancement in stability for Na55 and thus a
relatively higher melting temperature.

Further evidence for the role of quantum shell eﬀects
in melting may be obtained by examining the shape
of the cluster before and after melting.
In Fig. 3 we
plot the deformation parameter ǫdef for Na55, deﬁned as
ǫdef = 2Q1/(Q2 + Q3), where Q1 ≥ Q2 ≥ Q3 are the
eigenvalues, in descending order, of the quadrupole ten-
sor Qij = PI RIiRIj. Here i and j run from 1 to 3, I runs
over the number of ions, and RIi is the ith coordinate of
ion I relative to the cluster center of mass. A spherical
system (Q1 = Q2 = Q3) has ǫdef = 1; a value ǫdef > 1
indicates a quadrupole deformation of some type. From
Fig. 3 we see that at low temperatures ǫdef ≈ 1, corre-
sponding to the compact icosahedral ground state, but

as the cluster melts, the system acquires a quadrupole
deformation with ǫdef ≈ 1.6. A more detailed investiga-
tion of this deformation with two-dimensional deforma-
tion parameters such as the Hill-Wheeler parameters [27]
(not shown) indicates the cluster to be undergoing shape
ﬂuctuations around a net prolate deformation. A typical
deformed liquidlike structure is shown in Fig. 1(d). A
related phenomenon was observed earlier by Rytk¨onen
et al. [28] for Na40, except that the magic Na40 clus-
ter underwent an octupole deformation rather than a
quadrupole deformation as observed here for the non-
magic Na55. We do not observe statistically signiﬁcant
quadrupole deformations for Na92 or Na142, for which
ǫdef ≈ 1 at all temperatures.

Interestingly, simulations of Na55 carried out by us
within the SMA model do not show a deformation upon
melting, but rather the cluster remains essentially spher-
ical at all temperatures, ǫdef ≈ 1. Since the SMA model
explicitly excludes quantum shell eﬀects, we believe that

N ≈ 150 or so where a full KS treatment is warranted.

FIG. 3: Time-averaged coeﬃcient ǫdef (see text) describ-
ing the degree of quadrupole deformation of Na55 (continuous
line) and Na92 (dotted line).

the deformation of Na55 is due to the quantal Jahn-
Teller distortion of the open-shell system of valence elec-
trons. The deformation also agrees well with that found
in jellium-model calculations for Na55 that we have car-
ried out. Evidently, the compact ground-state structure
is favored by the possibility of geometric packing into
an icosahedron, while in the nonrigid liquidlike state the
cluster can lower its free energy by deforming sponta-
neously. On this reasoning, the magic Na92 cluster would
not be expected to deform upon melting, consistent with
the observation. On the other hand, the Na142 cluster
may deform slightly; presumably, the Jahn-Teller forces
here are suﬃciently weak that any deformation is not
statistically signiﬁcant.

Note that, as mentioned earlier, the melting tempera-
ture is strongly inﬂuenced by the potential-energy diﬀer-
ence δE between liquidlike and solidlike states. There-
fore, even if the ground state is quite spherical, as for
Na55, the melting temperature may still be inﬂuenced by
important quantal deformation eﬀects entering only in
the liquidlike state. The KS simulations undertaken here
incorporate all these various eﬀects correctly.

In conclusion, the KS approach appears to be capable
of making quantitative predictions of melting tempera-
tures and latent heats in Na clusters. Na55, Na92, and
Na142 are each magic or nearly magic, but only Na55 and
Na142 are also close to icosahedral shell closures. The
fact that Na92 melts at a signiﬁcantly lower temperature
than the other two shows that geometric eﬀects are very
important in determining the pattern of melting temper-
atures observed experimentally. However, electronic shell
eﬀects can play an important role too, both in inﬂuencing
overall binding energies and bond lengths as a function
of size, and indirectly via shape deformation eﬀects that
may arise diﬀerently in the solidlike and liquidlike states.
For an accurate treatment of the metallic bonding, and a
quantitative prediction of melting temperatures and la-
tent heats, it is essential to incorporate electronic shell
eﬀects appropriately, as is possible, for example, within
the KS approach used here. This is especially true for

ABSTRACT

Symmetry adaptation techniques are applied to the determination of the intensity of two-
photon absorption transitions, between Stark levels of conﬁgurations with opposite parities,
for transition ions in ﬁnite symmetry environments. The equivalence between third-order
mechanisms and second- plus ﬁrst-order mechanisms is clearly established. A compact
formula is derived for the intensity of a two-photon transition between two levels with
well-deﬁned symmetries. A set of (selection) rules which controls the number of intensity
parameters for inter-conﬁgurational transitions is given. The formalism is illustrated with
the case of an ion with 4f conﬁguration in tetragonal symmetry.

ABSTRACT

Symmetry adaptation techniques are applied to the determination of the
intensity of two-photon absorption transitions, between Stark levels of con-
ﬁgurations with opposite parities, for transition ions in ﬁnite symmetry en-
vironments. The equivalence between third order mechanisms and second-
plus ﬁrst-order mechanisms is clearly established. A compact formula is
derived for the intensity of a two-photon transition between two levels with
well-deﬁned symmetries. A set of (selection) rules which controls the inten-
sity parameters for inter-conﬁgurational transitions is given. The formal-
ism is illustrated with the case of an ion with 4f conﬁguration in tetragonal
symmetry.

1. Introduction

→

The theory of two-photon absorption spectroscopy for an ion with a partly-ﬁlled shell
embedded in a crystal has received a great deal of attention in recent years [1-13]. It is the
n′ℓ′ inter-conﬁgurational two-photon
aim of this paper to develop a formalism for nℓ
transitions when the two involved (one-electron) conﬁgurations have opposite parities. This
problem has been already addressed by Gayen and Hamilton [7], Gayen et al. [7], Leavitt
[11], Makhanek et al. [4], and Sztucki and Str¸ek [9]. However, little attention has been
paid to symmetry adaptation techniques (i.e., group-theoretical considerations from both a
qualitative and a quantitative viewpoint) for inter-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions.
In this paper, we follow the general line adopted in Refs. [12,13] for intra-conﬁgurational
two-photon transitions in order to develop a model incorporating parity violation by the
odd components of the crystal-ﬁeld interaction and symmetry adaptation to the chain
G∗. (The group G∗ denotes the double group of the point symmetry group G of
O(3)∗
the ion site.) The model is applied to the case of the Ce3+ ion in CaF2 [7] and LuPO4
[14].

2. Transition element

We begin with the (electronic) transition matrix element Mi→f for a two-photon
absorption between an initial state i and a ﬁnal state f . We work in the framework of the
electric dipolar approximation and use single-mode excitations of energy ¯hω, wave-vector
~k, and polarization vector ~
for the radiation ﬁeld. (For the sake of simplicity, we ﬁrst

consider that the two absorbed photons are identical.) Then, the matrix element Mi→f is

The transition matrix element Mi→f given by (1) and (4)-(6) vanishes since the ini-
tial and ﬁnal states have opposite parities. In order to generate non-vanishing transition
matrix elements, we must admit that the parity of the initial and ﬁnal state vectors is
not well-deﬁned. This is the case if the crystal-ﬁeld part of H contains odd components
either because the site symmetry is non-centrosymmetric or because of the vibration of

by

In deriving (7) and (8), we have made use of the following points.

(i) We have supposed that the scrambling between the state vectors of opposite parities
is restriced to the interaction, via the operator O, of the conﬁgurations nℓ and n′ℓ′. The
operator O can be viewed as the odd part of the crystal-ﬁeld interaction contained in H
and thus can be developed either as

(The crystal-ﬁeld parameters B[kq] in (9a) correspond to the Rajnak-Wybourne param-
eters in a somewhat diﬀerent form since we want to reserve the notation Bk
q for the q-th
component of a tensor Bk to be deﬁned below.)

(ii) Furthermore, we have taken into account that, due to the G-invariance of the
operator O, the quantum numbers Γγ and Γ′γ′ remain good quantum numbers for the
states i and f , respectively.

(iii) Finally, we have applied the (quasi-closure) approximation (cf. Refs. [18,19])

The next approximation is to suppose that the intermediate states v in (1) are mixed
by the operator O in a way similar to the one for the states i and f and that, in addition,
they may have a predominant character of type nℓ or n′ℓ′. Consequently, we take

The transition matrix element (1) now can be non-zero if we replace the initial, inter-

where we have neglected the terms in (1/∆)4 in Mi→f and taken into consideration the
hermiticity property of the operator O. The notation M (2 + 1)i→f for Mi→f indicates
that the transition matrix element has been calculated from second-order time-dependent
perturbation theory and ﬁrst-order time-independent perturbation theory.

It is interesting to note that the result (14) can be obtained in a diﬀerent way by
invoking third-order mechanisms and by making use of approximations similar to the ones
employed for deriving M (2 + 1)i→f . By third-order mechanisms, we mean that we start
from the transition moment for a three-photon absorption transition where we replace one
of the operators ~D. ~
by the operator O with change of denominators and appropriate
E
permutations. This leads to

The notation M (3)i→f for Mi→f is a reminder that the calculation of the transition matrix
element arises from third-order time-dependent perturbation theory. The state vectors in

states v are of either nℓ or n′ℓ′ type. By using the approximation (11), we get

so that we ﬁnally arrive at the important result

M (3)i→f = M (2 + 1)i→f

(17)

At this stage, it should be noted that the equivalence described by (17) also holds when the
two absorbed photons are not identical. In this case, we have to replace ∆ by ¯hω1 + ¯hω2
(for more details, see the thesis by one of the authors (M. D.)).
3. Intensities

Equation (14) and its analogue in terms of non-identical photons can be worked out
by using recoupling and symmetry adaptation techniques. In the case of two non-identical
photons, this leads to

expressions for M [(hk)t] and Hef f agree with those derived by Leavitt [11] from second
quantization techniques and by Sztucki and Str¸ek [9] from ordinary Wigner-Racah calculus.

in a basis adapted to the chain O(3)∗

the property (30) and the following selection rules.

here as the product of two similar factors since there is no internal multiplicity label β for
tetragonal symmetry.)
4.1. Ce3+ in CaF2
Two-photon experiments for the ion Ce3+ (of conﬁguration 4f 1) in CaF2 (with local
site symmetry G = C4v) have been reported in Ref. [7]. The polarization dependence of
the inter-conﬁgurational transition 2F5/2(Γ7)
5d(Γ7) (between the ground state of the
4f 1 conﬁguration and the ground state of the 5d1 conﬁguration) has been interpreted by
Gayen and Hamilton [7] on the basis of the group-theoretical formalism from Bader and
Gold [3] and by Makhanek et al. [4] on a more quantitative basis.
From equations (35) and (36), the intensity of the 2F5/2(Γ7)

5d(Γ7) transition can

The F− charge compensator in CaF2 has an equal probability of going into an interstitial
site along the [100], [010] or [001] directions. Therefore, the intensity strength of the
2F5/2(Γ7)

5d(Γ7) transition has to be averaged as

[1¯10]), respectively, which corre-
spond to the three experimental situations considered by Gayen and Hamilton [7]. The
intensity formulas (41) formally exhibit the same θ-dependence than those obtained in
Ref. [7]. Equations (41), where the intensity parameters A, B and C can be a priori cal-
culated from the formalism developed in section 3, constitutes a justiﬁcation of the purely
group-theoretical approach used in Ref. [7]. (Let us remember that the approach used in
Ref. [7] is based on group-theoretical selection rules for intra-conﬁgurational transitions.)
Finally, it should be noted that the scalar terms (corresponding to h or ¯h = 0 in (27)), de-
scribed in (41) by the intensity parameters I[00A1; Γ7Γ7] and I[02A1; Γ7Γ7], do not occur
in the treatment of Ref. [4].
4.2. Ce3+ in LuPO4
Inter-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions for Ce3+ in LuPO4 (site symmetry G =
D2d) have been observed by Piehler [14]. The transitions investigated are of the type
2F5/2(Γ6)
5d (between the ground state of the 4f 1 conﬁguration and the Stark com-
ponents of the 5d1 conﬁguration) with linear polarization. Piehler has obtained a ﬁrst
transition (at 2¯hω = 30460 cm−1) whose intensity vanishes when the two (identical) pho-
40000 cm−1) whose intensity
tons are polarized along the z-axis and a second one (at 2¯hω
does not vanish for polarization along the z-axis.

The symmetry species of the 5d ﬁnal states reached in Ref. [14] can be easily deter-
mined from (35) and (36). Indeed, from (35) and (36), the intensities of the transitions
2F5/2(Γ6)

5d(Γ6 or Γ7) can be seen to be

→

SΓ6→Γ6 = A′ + B′ sin2 θ + C′ sin2 2θ
SΓ6→Γ7 = A′′ sin4 θ cos2 2ϕ + B′′ sin4 θ sin2 2ϕ + C′′ sin2 2θ

where

A′ = (1/3) I[00A1; Γ6Γ6] + (2/3) I[22A1; Γ6Γ6]
B′ =
C′ =
A′′ = (1/2) I[22B1; Γ6Γ7] B′′ = (1/2) I[22B2; Γ6Γ7] C′′ = (1/2) I[22E; Γ6Γ7]

−

Thus, equation (42) shows that only the intensity strength SΓ6→Γ7 vanishes when the
electric ﬁeld is polarized along the z-axis (i.e., θ = 0). As a consequence, the symmetry of
the ﬁnal states is Γ7 for the ﬁrst transition (at 30460 cm−1) and Γ6 for the second transition
(at 40000 cm−1). This result is in accordance with the one obtained by Piehler [14] on the
basis of selection rules derived from (qualitative) group-theoretical considerations. Here
again, it is to be mentioned that the intensities (42) are calculable from ab initio principles
once the intensity parameters (43) are known.
5. Concluding remarks

The main result of this paper is formula (27) which gives the polarization dependence
of an inter-conﬁgurational two-photon transition between Stark components arising from
the conﬁgurations nℓ and n′ℓ′ of opposite parities. The obtained formula bears the same
form as the corresponding one for intra-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions.

11

The intensity parameters I in (27) are, likewise in the case of intra-conﬁgurational two-
photon transitions, model-dependent. More precisely, they depend on the wave-functions
for the initial and ﬁnal states and on the odd crystal-ﬁeld parameters. They also incorpo-
rate the information coming from the involved symmetry group. They can be calculated
in an ab initio way or may be considered as phenomenological parameters.

Finally, we would like to mention that the model developed in the present work applies
nℓN−1n′ℓ′ two-photon transitions with ℓ + ℓ′ odd. (The passage
to the case of nℓN
from one-electron conﬁgurations to N -electron conﬁgurations does not aﬀect the symmetry
considerations.)

Intermolecular polarization interactions in water are determined using a minimal atomic multipole
model constructed with distributed polarizabilities. Hydrogen bonding and other properties of
water-water interactions are reproduced to ﬁne detail by only three multipoles µH , µO, and θO and
two polarizabilities αO and αH , which characterize a single water molecule and are deduced from
single molecule data.

Understanding polarization forces is crucial in many
molecular systems such as molecular clusters,
liquids,
or solids, speciﬁcally those containing polar and polar-
izable molecules. Polarization eﬀects in water are partic-
ularly strong, as can be judged by the enhancement of the
molecular dipole from 1.855 D for an isolated molecule to
2.6 — 3.2 D in condensed state.1,2 Water is a very basic
substance.3 It is a fascinating object to study because of
its singular properties, its signiﬁcance in biological sys-
tems, and because it is a classic example of hydrogen
bonding.4 Hydrogen bonding, which itself is one of the
key elements of the functioning of life, is largely a po-
larization eﬀect. Unfortunately, no commonly accepted
model describes it simply and accurately at the same
time. Here we show that application of recent rules for
minimal atomic multipoles5 combined with the notion of
distributed polarizabilities lead straightforwardly, with-
out further intervention, to a very transparent model for
polarization forces in water. Hydrogen bonding and other
properties of water-water interactions are reproduced to
ﬁne detail with only three atomic multipoles and two po-
larizabilities, whose values are deduced based on single
molecule data.

Intermolecular potential for water has been extensively
studied, with about 150 models introduced since 1930s,
indicating diﬃculties in this area.6 Recent accurate pa-
rameterizations involving several tens of parameters are
available based on tuning to rich vibration-rotation-
tunneling (VRT) spectra,7,8 or to high-level quantum-
chemical calculations,9 or both.10 Some models are based
on molecular multipole moments and require high-order
multipoles.11 Following seminal work by Rahman and
Stillinger,12 many empirical models involve distributed
charges.13–22 Most of the force ﬁelds use static charges
thus ignoring or averaging the polarization eﬀects, while
other models incorporate polarizabilities explicitly.16–22
Work 17 ﬁrst introduced molecular polarizability of water
distributed over atomic sites.

It has been recently recognized that hydrogens need
not be assigned charges in distributed charge models.5
The hydrogen’s sole electron participates in the chemical
bond and is not centered at the proton. Therefore, hy-
drogen is best described by an atomic dipole µH placed at
the proton and directed along the bond. Assigning both

charge and dipole causes redundancy and leads to un-
physical results. This rule is an integral part of the mini-
mal atomic multipole expansion (MAME),5 which elimi-
nates the redundancies by a careful choice of the minimal
set of atomic multipoles based on the Lewis structure of
the molecule.

MAME rules lead to the following expression for the

electrostatic potential of a single water molecule:

φ(r) = µH

(r − r1) · r1/l

|r − r1|3 + µH

(r − r2) · r2/l

.

Since protons have no charge, neutrality allows no charge
on the oxygen either. The dipole µO and quadrupole
θO describe the two lone pairs on oxygen.5 Origin is at
the oxygen, r1,2 are the positions of protons, r1,2 = l,
n = (r1 +r2)/|r1 +r2| is the unit vector along the symme-
try axis, and n1,2 are unit vectors in the directions of lone
pairs (Fig. 1). Experimental geometry has l = 0.9572 ˚A
and a nearly tetrahedral bond angle β = 104.52◦ be-
tween r1 and r2.23 We take n1 and n2 to be at the tetra-
= 109.47◦.19 Signiﬁcant deviation from
hedral angle β
this value leads to a dramatic deterioration of accuracy
of Eq. (1) as seen in the inset.

Our goal is to extend the static model to describe the
ﬁeld induced by a polarized molecule subject to external
ﬁelds. In doing so we again keep only the minimal set
of multipoles to avoid redundancies. Charge redistribu-
tion part of the molecular polarizability24 vanishes for
water due to the absence of charged sites. Thus we as-
sign polarizabilities to individual nuclei in such a way as
to reproduce experimental molecular polarizability. The
smallest component is αyy = 1.4146(3) ˚A3 normal to the
molecular plane, the next is αzz = 1.4679(13) ˚A3 along
the dipole moment, and the largest is αxx = 1.5284(13)
˚A3 in the longest dimension.25

Atomic polarizabilities reﬂect the local atomic environ-
ments and need not necessarily be isotropic. Tetrahedral
coordination of oxygen suggests to assign it an isotropic
polarizability αO. For hydrogens the polarizability αH
along the OH bond may diﬀer from the polarizability α⊥
normal to it. To deduce αO, αH , and α⊥ we express the
molecular polarizability,

2
αxx = αO + 2αH sin
αyy = αO + 2α⊥,
2
αzz = αO + 2αH cos

β/2 + 2α⊥ cos2 β/2,

2

In a surprise twist, the determinant of this linear system
is identically zero. Equations (2) are therefore dependent
and possess a solution only if the quantity

(3)

is zero. Thus, the model is adequate if the relation
holds between the molecular polarizability components.
Substituting the experimental values into (3) we get
0.0093˚A3, which is indeed close to zero. Two indepen-
dent equations suggest that one of the atomic polariz-
abilities can be safely omitted. The natural choice is to
set α⊥ = 0, implying that the dipole moments on protons
can change their value, but not direction. Solving (2) we
get

3
αO = αyy = 1.4146 ˚A
αH = (αxx + αzz)/2 − αyy = 0.0836 ˚A3.

and

Thus, the bulk of molecular polarizability comes from the
oxygen, which is consistent with its atomic size, while
the small polarizabilities on the protons account for the
(small) anisotropy of the molecular polarizability tensor.
Three gas-phase multipoles from a density functional
calculation, µH = 0.675 D, µO = 1.033 D, and ΘO =
1.260 D˚A5 result in the molecular dipole µ = 1.854 D
and the quadrupole components Θ = Θxx − Θyy = 4.973
D˚A, Θzz = 0.142 D˚A.36 These should be compared to
experimental data,26,27 µ = 1.8546(6) D, Θ = 5.126(25)
D˚A, and Θzz = 0.113(27) D˚A.

We again adjust the three atomic multipoles to satisfy
the three experimental values precisely to avoid any com-
putational input. The molecular dipole and quadrupole
are expressed in terms of the atomic multipoles as

µ = µO + 2µH cos β/2,

In practice, we face here an almost identical problem, in

when an ideal tetrahedral angle is substituted for β. A
relation similar to (3) in this case reads simply Θzz = 0.
Actual Θzz is indeed small, but not zero, and β deviates
noticeably from 109.47◦. Nevertheless, smallness of the
determinant indicates that the ﬁnite accuracy data can
be satisﬁed by a range of atomic multipoles, and so the
third equation in (5) cannot be used reliably.

Thus, we use the ﬁrst two equations to express µO and
θO in terms of µH , which guarantees to reproduce experi-
mental µ and Θ, while keeping reasonable Θzz. The DFT
value µH = 0.675 D yields µO = 1.029 D and θO = 1.352
D˚A, with Θzz = 0.160 D˚A. The model is thus completely
deﬁned and readily yields the polarization energy EP for
the water dimer, trimer and larger clusters.24

Water clusters from dimers on up have been ex-
tensively studied with both experiment7,28–30 and
theory.7,8,31–33 Six-dimensional adiabatic energy surface
of the dimer has 8 equivalent minima34 split in a com-
plex fashion by zero-point tunneling motion. Softness of
the pair potential requires care when relating it to the
experimental observables.7

gles is ﬁxed at the minimum value, as the other one is varied.
EP is calculated for the deﬁned system of atomic multipoles
and polarizabilities in the standard manner,24 by computing
ﬁelds of all multipoles of one molecule exerted on the multi-
poles of another molecule, and solving for self-consistency.

Equilibrium hydrogen bonded conﬁguration has a sym-
metry plane (Fig. 2, inset) and is characterized by the
oxygen-oxygen distance ROO, the donor angle θd and the
acceptor angle θa. The hydrogen bond forms when the
donor proton points against one of the lone pairs of the

Actual angles deviate slightly from these ideal values and
are known with some scatter.

For the experimental geometry we get EP = −7.046
kcal/mol. Adding 1.820 kcal/mol for the exchange and
dispersion energy [VRT(ASP-W)III8 value] we get equi-
librium binding energy De = 5.110 kcal/mol. The model
also yields the total dipole moment of the dimer in ex-
cellent agreement with experiment (Table I).

Since EP is only a part of the total interaction, which
also contains exchange and dispersion terms, we ﬁx ROO
and analyze the orientation dependence (Fig. 2). The
minimum is achieved at θd = 2.14◦ and θa = 66.26◦,
which is close to, but should not be confused with the
equilibrium hydrogen-bonded conﬁguration, since other
terms may shift the minimum. Rotation of either the
donor by ∆θd ≈ −β, or the acceptor by ∆θa ≈ −β
produces an alternative hydrogen bonded arrangement
sketched under the local minima in Fig. 2.

In order to further assess the quality of the model, we
analyze the energy variation along a path where the ex-
change and dispersion terms vary little. We choose to
rotate the donor by an angle φ around the bridging OH
bond (Fig. 2). Only a single proton then changes its po-
sition and stays far from all the nuclei of the acceptor at
all φ.

Figure 3 shows excellent agreement with all three best
pair potentials. Note the small (< 1 kcal/mol) total
amplitude of the variation, which is not described by a
simple cos φ function. The overall agreement in the full
range of φ is better with the ab-initio-based SAPT-5s9
potential (the inset). However, at small φ we get a near
coincidence with the other two curves, VRT(ASP-W)III
and SAPT-5st,10 which are both spectroscopically-tuned.
This is not surprising, assuming the spectroscopic tuning
is more sensitive to the region near the equilibrium.

HO ∝ αH αO.

Explicit distributed polarizabilities (4) suggest an esti-
mate of the dispersion energy. Due to the fast r−6 decay,
the dispersion is dominated by two terms, ED
OO ∝ αOαO
and ED
Small αH in the second term
is compensated by the proximity of the donor hydro-
gen to the oxygen of the acceptor. Neglecting disper-
sion nonadditivity and assuming an universal scaling of

compared to 1.56 kcal/mol from Fig. 3 of Ref. 33. For
this crude estimate we used z = 344 kcal/mol value for
Ar. The factor 2

Since the minimal model is constructed based solely
on monomer properties, we may speculate that it should
describe larger clusters as well, where the non-pairwise
additivity of energy is important.9,29 Such nonadditivity
results from self-consistency of all the induced moments
in the cluster,24 and may be relevant for the cooperativity
of hydrogen bonding in protein secondary structures.35

This work makes a step towards a chemical model for
polarization intermolecular forces by combining minimal
atomic multipoles with distributed polarizabilities, which
together yield a transparent model for polarization forces
in water. Its success raises a question of broader applica-
bility, especially to polarization and hydrogen bonding in
peptides and proteins, and in water-protein interactions.

Abstract

We present a method (the Aufbau/Abbau method) for optimizing the structure of a whole se-

ries of clusters without making any assumptions on the structure. Subsequently, the method is

combined with the embedded-atom method in determining the structure of the two energetically

lowest isomers of NiN clusters with N up to 150. Finally, various analytical descriptors are intro-

duced that are used in studying the overall shape of the clusters, their structure and stability, and

possible growth and dissociation processes.

About two decades ago the experimental observation and theoretical description of so-

called magic numbers in clusters of simple metals (see [1,2]) provided an excellent example

of how experiment and theory could supplement each other in the development of the un-

derstanding of materials properties. The theoretical studies for any but the smallest clusters

were based on the jellium model, i.e., the internal structure of the cluster was completely

neglected and the core electrons and the nuclei were smeared out to a homogeneous jellium

in whose ﬁeld the valence electrons moved. Moreover, in the ﬁrst studies the jellium was

supposed to be spherical and to have sharp boundaries, although these assumptions in later

studies have been relaxed partially (see [2]).

For theoretical studies of any other metal clusters MN than those of simple metals, one

encounters the serious problem that when the valence electrons are anything but completely

delocalized, the (spherical) jellium model may not provide a realistic approximation. This

is, e.g., the case for transition-metal clusters where the nearest-neighbor interactions be-

tween the atoms are important, so that the precise structure of the cluster as well as the

inhomogeneities of the electron density are to be included in any realistic description. Then,

furthermore, the fact that the number of structural degrees of freedom (3N − 6 or 3N − 5)

together with the fact that the number of metastable structures grows very fast with N

makes detailed systematic studies of how the properties depend on N for any but the abso-

lutely smallest clusters extremely demanding. On the other hand, the further development

of this ﬁeld requires a precise understanding of how the properties of interest depend on

the structure, size, and composition of the clusters, which, unfortunately, is very diﬃcult to

achieve theoretically or experimentally.

Here we shall report results of a theoretical study of the structural and energetic proper-

ties of NiN clusters for all N up to 150. Our calculations have made no assumptions about

the structure of the clusters whereby they diﬀer from most other studies of these systems

(see, e.g., [3,4,5,6,7] and references therein) of which the previously most detailed and un-

biased study3 considered only up to N = 80. Since we have had to perform often several

1000 structure-relaxations for a given N without making any assumption on structure or

symmetry, parameter-free methods cannot be applied, and, therefore, we have employed the

embedded-atom method (EAM) in the calculation of the total energy for a given structure.

Moreover, we have developed an Aufbau/Abbau method for the structure optimization. This

method is partly inspired by experimental conditions where clusters often are produced by

2

adding atoms individually to a seed, although the experiments often take place at conditions

far from equilibrium and from T = 0 K. A preliminary description of our approach has been

presented elsewhere,8,9 but compared with that work the present one is much more accurate

(through a much more detailed structure optimization that also includes more isomers), and,

in addition, we shall here present various theoretical tools with which we can extract the

fundamental structural and energetic properties of these clusters.

In our Aufbau/Abbau method we consider clusters with L and L + P atoms with P ≃

5 − 10. For each of those we study a set of randomly generated structures. Using a quasi-

Newton method relaxed local-total-energy minima are identiﬁed and the structures of the

lowest total energy selected. One by one atoms are added to the structure with L atoms

(many hundred times for each size), and the structures are relaxed. Parallel, one by one

atoms are removed from the structure with L + P atoms. From this two series of structures

for L ≤ N ≤ L + P those structures of the lowest energies are chosen and these are used

as seeds for a new set of calculations. First, when no lower total energies are found, it is

assumed that the structures of the global-total-energy minima have been identiﬁed, and we

proceed to larger clusters. In some few cases, extra high-symmetry structures were added

as possible structures, which in one case (N = 75) resulted in an otherwise unidentiﬁed

lowest-energy structure. According to our experience, for a given N we have to consider

about 500 randomly generated structures for the smallest values of N and about 1000 for

the largest values. Moreover, about 3 Aufbau/Abbau cycles are needed for the smaller N

and up to 10 for the larger N.

In comparison with our earlier study, the method has been extended so that by keep-

ing track of more structures of the lowest total energies, we obtain the energetically lowest

isomers for each size, and a much more detailed search has led to the identiﬁcation of new

structurals for several N. Since our approach (as any other unbiased method for structure

optimization of larger, low-symmetric systems) requires a large number of total-energy cal-

culations for diﬀerent, larger structures, it cannot be combined with accurate parameter-free

electronic-structure methods, but has to be based on approximate schemes for calculating

the total energy. Here, we combine the Aufbau/Abbau method with the EAM method for

the latter purpose.

The basic idea of the EAM10,11,12,13 is to consider every atom as an impurity embedded

in a host provided by all other atoms. The tails of the electron densities of the host atoms

3

inside the guest atom lead to a modiﬁcation in the energy of this atom, Fi(ρh
the atom, and ρh
i

i ), where i labels
is the electron density from the host atoms. Usually this is evaluated at

the site of the nucleus of the ith atom. The remaining part of the binding energy of the

system of interest is approximated through pair potentials, 1
2

Pj6=i φij(Rij) with Rij being

the distance between atoms i and j. The embedding energies Fi and the pair potentials

φij have been obtained by ﬁtting to theoretical and experimental information on diﬀerent

inﬁnite systems.12,13 The EAM is conceptually simple, but it grasps the major parts of the

interatomic interactions and gives accurate structural and energetic information on various

extended and truncated systems.12,13,14

Before discussing our results in detail we shall address the question of the accuracy of

the EAM method. As such, it is constructed ﬁrst of all for describing cohesion in extended

metallic systems like crystals without or with defects and surfaces. Due to the complexity of

the present study, it is not possible to apply a parameter-free method, and simpler methods

like the EAM have to be used, but nevertheless it may be asked whether the EAM can be used

for the, after all, relatively small systems of our present study. We shall therefore compare

our calculated structural properties for nickel clusters with N = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and

13 with those of accurate electronic-structure calculations using diﬀerent density-functional

methods.15,16,17,18,19 Table I list some of the key quantities in the structural characterization

of the diﬀerent clusters as obtained with the diﬀerent methods, and in Fig. 1 our optimized

structures are shown. It is seen in Table I that our results agree well with those of the other

studies, both concerning the structure itself and concerning the interatomic distances. Most

of the discrepancies are related to smaller distortions that may be due to electronic eﬀects

(e.g., Jahn-Teller distortions) that are not included in the EAM method. Thus, we conclude

that our approach is accurate.

In Fig. 2 we show our calculated binding energy per atom for nickel clusters with N

ranging from 1 to 150. As is generally found, the binding energy for clusters is ﬁrst of all

a monotonously increasing function of N with, however, some extra structure. In order to

identify the latter more clearly, we show in the ﬁgure also the stability function S(N) =

Etot(N + 1) + Etot(N − 1) − 2Etot(N) which has maxima for particularly stable structures.

These are also marked in the ﬁgure. As we shall see, some of the particularly stable structures

correspond to particularly symmetric ones. Particularly stable structures are found for N

= 13 (the most pronounced one), 19, 23, 39, 55, and 147.

There exists some previous experimental and theoretical studies of the properties of NiN

clusters, of which many focus on the inner structural aspects (including symmetry, see, e.g.,

[3,6,7,22,23,24]). The most detailed study of the energetics of NiN clusters is the theoretical

one of Doye and Wales3 who used the Sutton-Chen potential in calculating structural and

energetic properties of NiN clusters with N up to 80. They ﬁnd particular stability for N =

13, 38, 50, 55, 64, 71, 75, and 79, which is in partial agreement with our results. As discussed

by Parks et al.23,24 the structures given by Doye and Wales seem to deviate somewhat from

experimental ﬁndings, suggesting that the Sutton-Chen potential is not suﬃciently accurate

for such studies.

In a tight-binding molecular-dynamics study, Luo studied clusters with

up to 55 atoms.4 He found most stable structures for N = 21, 31, 35, 38, 40, 47, 50, and

55, only partly in agreement with the results of Doye and Wales and of us. On the other

hand, Montejano-Carrizales et al.5 used the EAM in analysing the so-called umbrella growth

models for icosahedral Ni clusters. Although they thereby make certain assumptions on the

structure their N values for particularly stable structures are in general in good agreement

with ours and with those of Doye and Wales. This leads support to the umbrella growth

model. This conclusion is further supported below.

The special stability of the cluster sizes mentioned above is supported by comparing the

energies of the two energetically lowest isomers. First for N = 6 and onwards we identify

two diﬀerent isomers, and their total-energy diﬀerence is shown in the lowest panel in Fig.

2. Here, the most signiﬁcant features correlate closely with those of the stability function.

Besides the stability a number of other issues have attracted signiﬁcant interest in cluster

physics. These include the structure of the individual clusters, whether growth modes can

be identiﬁed, and how the clusters will dissociate. We shall now address these issues.

For a given cluster NiN we calculate the eigenvalues Iαα of the matrix containing the

moments of inertia PN

i=1 siti with s and t being the x, y, and z in a coordinate system with
the origin at the center of mass of the cluster. For a spherical jellium Iαα ∝ N 5/3, and
therefore we show (Fig. 3) Iαα/N 5/3. If the three eigenvalues are identical the overall shape

of the cluster is approximately spherical. Such clusters are marked with points in the lowest

row in the uppermost part of the ﬁgure and are found for N = 1, 4, 6, 13, 26, 28, 38, and

55, which partially correspond to particularly stable clusters; cf. Fig. 2. When two of the

eigenvalues are small and only one is large, the cluster is essentially prolate (cigar-shaped),

whereas it with two large eigenvalues and one small one is oblate (lens-shaped). In the ﬁgure

5

we have marked which of the clusters have these two types of overall shapes. Except for

the absolutely smallest clusters, we have that, if the cluster structures can be considered as

obtained by adding atom by atom to a largely ﬁxed core, the clusters will either be close

to spherical (so that several changes between prolate and oblate structures are possible), or

one or the other of the two structure types will dominate in large N-intervals. However,

the results of Fig. 3 show that except for N above about 137, the eigenvalues Iαα are very

diﬀerent, so that the clusters have pronounced prolate or oblate shapes. Moreover, several

changes between these two structure types occur in the range of N we have considered.

A more detailed way of analysing whether the cluster with N atoms can be considered

as formed by adding a single atom to the cluster with N − 1 atoms is provided by deﬁning

similarity indices as follows. We calculate the (N − 1)(N − 2)/2 interatomic distances d0

ij (in

a.u.) for the (N − 1)-atom cluster and sort them. Subsequently, we consider all the possible

(N − 1)-atomic parts of the N-atom cluster, and for those we also calculate and sort the
interatomic distances dij. The smallest value of q1 with (N −1)(N −2)
ij − dij)2
deﬁnes then the similarity index, s1 = (1 + q1)−1, which is 1 for a cluster that is obtained

1 = PN −1
q2

i>j=1(d0

2

by adding one atom to the previous one, and approaches 0 for very diﬀerent structures.

Another similarity index s2 is obtained by instead of using the interatomic distances we use

the distances of the individual atoms to the center of mass of the cluster. Denoting these

so-called radial distances r0

i (in a.u.) for the (N − 1)-atom cluster and ri (in a.u.) for the

(N − 1)-atom fragment of the N-atom cluster, we consider the smallest value of q2 with

(N − 1)q2

2 = PN −1

i=1 (r0

i − ri)2, and deﬁne s2 = (1 + q2)−1.

These two functions are shown in Figs. 4(a) and (b). Up to N around 40 both functions

possess a number of peaks indicating that no simple growth mechanism can be identiﬁed.

This is in accord with the experimental observations of Pellarin et al.25 who moreover suggest

that above that the umbrella growth model agrees with their observations, in agreement with

the results of Montejano-Carrizales et al.5 However, both of our similarity indices ﬁnd for

larger N peaks at N = 39, 51, 63, 73, 80, 87, 105, and 138, implying that also here size-

dependent structural diﬀerences occur. Thus, in total we ﬁnd an overall support for the

umbrella growth model although for many values of N this model does not give an exact

description of the structure.

In order to obtain a quantitative estimate of the similarity of the structure for a given N

with that of a fragment of the crystal we proceed as follows. We consider a large, but ﬁnite

6

fragment of the fcc crystal structure and place a center (arbitrarily) at (0,0,0), ( 1
4a, 1
( 1
any of these centers, {rfcc
fcc = PN

2a,0,0), and
4 a,0) (with a being the length of the unit cell). The set of distances from the atoms to
i }, is sorted and compared with the radial distances for a given N-
i −ri)2. This deﬁnes the fcc similarity index, sfcc = (1+qfcc)−1.
i=1(rfcc
A related icosahedral similarity index sico is deﬁned by using the radial distances for the

atom cluster, Nq2

(relaxed) N = 309 icosahedral cluster in comparing with the diﬀerent clusters. The two

functions are shown in Figs. 4(c) and (d). It is seen that in the range 73–79 the structure is

related both to that of a fragment of the fcc crystal with, in addition, the center at (0,0,0)

and to the icosahedral structure. This indicates that in exactly this size range more diﬀerent

structural motifs are present. Two further peaks can be identiﬁed in Fig. 4(c): at N = 28

which corresponds to the center at ( 1

2a,0,0) and at N = 38 which corresponds to the center
4 a,0). The lower panel shows that the icosahedral clusters are important around
N = 13, between N = 51 and N = 55, and above N = 138. We ﬁnally notice that the

at ( 1

4a, 1

structural characteristics often are not isolated to singular values of N but can be identiﬁed

also around the peaks.

In order to get insight into possible fragmentation channels we analyse the calculated

energies Etot as a function of N. Neglecting kinetic eﬀects (this is a crude approximation

and may have severe consequences for our conclusions), we seek for a given N that value of

K for which the dissociation energy Etot(N) − [Etot(K) + Etot(N − K)] is lowest. It turned

out that, without exception, this value of K was always 0, indicating that any cluster is

stabler than its dissociation products. This result is a consequence of the fact that Etot(N)

is upward curved, as indirectly can be seen in the upper part of Fig. 2.

Neglecting the K = 0 solution we found the results shown in Fig. 5. Except for one

case, K was found to be either 1 or 2, indicating that the clusters upon fragmentation will

dissociate in a highly asymmetric way by splitting oﬀ a single or a pair of atoms. The

exception is that of N = 16 for which K = 3 was found as a consequence of the particular

stability of the N = 13 cluster. The dissociation energies, also shown in Fig. 5, are seen to

lie around 4 eV for K = 1 and 2 and around 5 eV for K = 3 for the larger clusters.

Concluding we have presented results of a theoretical study of structural and energetic

properties of NiN clusters with all N up to N = 150. We stress that this study is the ﬁrst

where a systematic study of energetics, growth, dissociation, and structure of not only the

absolutely smallest clusters has been performed without more or less severe assumptions

7

of the structure. Our structure optimization was performed using our own Aufbau/Abbau

method, and due to the large number of total-energy calculations that was necessary we

used the approximate EAM for this purpose. As the main result we obtained the structure

and the total energy as functions of N, and these results were then subsequently used

in identifying particularly stable clusters, in classifying the overall shape of the clusters,

in discussing whether a simple growth mechanism could be applied (this was found not

to be the case), and in discussing possible fragmentation channels.

In order to extract

useful information from the obtained structural and energetic properties we introduced a

number of quantitative measures and subsequently applied them on our results. For the

ﬁrst time it was shown that for 73 ≤ N ≤ 79 the clusters possess more diﬀerent types of

structural characteristics, and, moreover, our theoretical study is the ﬁrst such to show that

for N = 147 a magic number occurs for a multilayer icosahedron structure. This result is in

perfect agreement with mass-spectroscopical experiments of Pellarin et al.25

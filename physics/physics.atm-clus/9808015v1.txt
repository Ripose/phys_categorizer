Abstract

The time-dependent local-density approximation (TDLDA) is applied to the

optical response of conjugated carbon molecules in the energy range of 0-30

eV, with calculations given for carbon chains, polyenes, retinal, benzene and

C60. The major feature of the spectra, the collective π

π∗ transition, is seen

−

at energies ranging from below 2 to 7 eV, and is reproduced by the theory

to a few tenths of an eV with a good account of systematic trends. However,

there is some indication that TDLDA predicts too much fragmentation of

the strength function in large molecules. Transition strengths are reproduced

with a typical accuracy of 20%. The theory also predicts a broad absorption

peak in the the range 15-25 eV, and this feature agrees with experiment in

I. INTRODUCTION

Mean ﬁeld theory is widely used in chemistry and physics, giving an approximation that

is very robust in its domain of validity. Particularly successful is the density-functional

theory [1], which treats the electron-electron interaction in a local-density approximation

(LDA), i.e. by adding a density-dependent contact term to the Hartree Hamiltonian. This

is similar to the αX approximation, but the contact term includes an approximate treatment

of correlation eﬀects as well as the exchange interaction. The theory is commonly used to

calculate ground state structures of molecules and condensed systems. A corresponding

theory for excitations is the time-dependent local-density approximation (TDLDA), which

has also been applied to a number of systems [11,2–12]. In this work, we will attempt to

make a systematic survey of the predictions of the TDLDA for conjugated carbon molecules.

Our calculations will be ab initio from the point of view of the electrons, since we take

the electron Hamiltonian from well-known prescriptions used in ab initio density-functional

Hamiltonians. However, we will not attempt to use the Hamiltonian to arrive at the nuclear

coordinates; the ground state problem has been well studied by others and our interest here

is in the excitations. In the next section we review the TDLDA theory and our numerical

implementation of it. Then we discuss the predictions and comparison with experiment for

carbon chains, polyenes, the aromatic ring, and C60.

II. THEORY

A. Formal aspects

The TDLDA theory is closely related to the time-dependent Hartree-Fock equation in-

troduced by Dirac [13]. That theory can be derived from a variational principle,

tial, related to the exchange-correlation energy vxc by Vex = dvxc/dn.

Several general remarks can be made here. Practitioners of the density-functional theory

often claim justiﬁcation for the Kohn-Sham equations based on formal existence theorems.

Theorems can also be proven for the time-dependent case [14], but our own partiality to

the theory is based on more pragmatic considerations. First, if the time dependence is slow,

the TDLDA should be as good as the static theory because the motion would be adiabatic

and governed by the same Hamiltonian. Second, integrals of the response over frequency

obey sum rules, and these are satisﬁed in principle by the small-amplitude TDLDA. Since

the sum rules are most sensitive to the high frequency behavior, we see that the TDLDA is

good at both extremes, and therefore promising for describing the middle ground.

The next remark concerns the domain of applicability of the theory. The TDLDA de-

scribes the system by a single Slater determinant which can be expressed in a particle-hole

basis as a particle-hole operator on the ground state. The theory thus does not contain the

degrees of freedom necessary to describe excitations that have a more complex character

than single-electron excitations. Not only will the experimental spectrum be more complex

due to mixing of states of diﬀerent particle-hole character but the coupling to vibrations

will broaden the transitions on an energy resolution scale of a few tenths of an eV. How-

ever, even though the TDLDA only includes single-electron degrees of freedom, it is far

superior to the static single-electron theory because it includes dynamic screening eﬀects.

The dynamic screening arises directly from the time dependence of the mean ﬁeld poten-

3

tial. It shifts transition strength up out of the lowest particle-hole excitations into a higher

frequency range, of course preserving the sum rule. This can be a very large eﬀect; in the

case of C60 considered below the strength of the lowest excitations are reduced by an order

of magnitude. In general, what we expect from the TDLDA is the frequency location and

strengths of the strong transitions, but not details of its fragmentation into the eigenstates

of the many-electron Hamiltonian.

There are several implementations of the TDLDA, particularly in the small-amplitude

limit, which is all that concern us unless nonlinear optical properties are wanted. The

real-time method has been applied in other ﬁelds to describe the small amplitude response

[15,16]. We emphasize that the time-dependent method we use here is equivalent to the

response function method used in ref. [10,9,11] and the matrix RPA method used in ref.

[6,3,17], provided only that the amplitude of the motion is small. Thus in principle the

results depend only on the assumed energy density function, and not on the particular

method used to solved the equations. Diﬀerent methods are advantageous under diﬀerent

circumstances. The matrix RPA is the only one of these methods that can treat nonlocal

interactions such as the Fock term. However, the matrix RPA method uses a particle-hole

representation of the perturbed wave function, which becomes ineﬃcient for systems having

a large number of particles. The arguments comparing the numerical eﬃciency of diﬀerent

methods is given in ref. [8]. In brief, the basic object to be computed in the response function

method is a D

D matrix, where D is the dimensionality of the basis. In the time-dependent

×

methods, the numerical object is the set of N vectors of dimensionality D, where N is the

number of electrons. The computational eﬀort scales with the size of the system as ND for

the time-dependent method with a sparse Hamiltonian, compared with D3 for the inversion

of the matrix in the response function methods.

B. Numerical aspects

The important decisions in a numerical implementation of the TDLDA are the choice of

basis, the choice of a local density function, and the choice of the basic quantity calculated:

time-dependent wave function, energy eigenstates, or frequency response. We consider these

aspects in turn.

1. Basis

The three most popular representations for the electron wave function are localized func-

tions such as Gaussians or atomic orbitals (e.g., ref. [6]), planes waves, and more recently,

spatial meshes [18]. We solve the TDLDA equations using a uniform spatial mesh, following

closely the technique introduced in ref. [19]. An important advantage of spatial meshes is

that the single-electron Hamiltonian is a sparse matrix. This allows one to consider vectors

for the particle wave functions with many tens of thousands of points. Of course, a uniform

spatial mesh has the disadvantage that the mesh size is determined by requirements of small

regions next to the ion centers. This is alleviated somewhat by the use of pseudopotentials

(see below). The important numerical parameters associated with the spatial mesh are the

mesh spacing ∆x and the total number of mesh points M. Thus the molecules are calculated

in a volume V

M(∆x)3. The boundary condition at the surface of the volume is deter-

∼

mined when the numerical representation of the diﬀerential operator in the Hamiltonian is

constructed. For most of our calculations, the operator takes the wave function to be zero

on the mesh points outside the volume. We use a higher-order diﬀerence operator in our

program, as was done in ref. [19,18]. The required mesh spacing depends on atoms involved;

with carbon we use ∆x = 0.3 ˚A which gives a HOMO-LUMO gap to within 0.1 eV of the

converged value for the Kohn-Sham equations. The geometry of the volume represented by

the mesh is determined by requiring the edge to be at least 4 ˚A from any ionic center. The

number of points needed ranges from 19000 in C2H4 to 103000 in C28H30.

5

2. Energy density function

For our energy density function, we use the widely applied exchange-correlation energy

given by ref. [20,21]. One can introduce more complicated energy functions that have gra-

dient corrections or self-interaction corrections, but it was not clear that there would be an

advantage in using a more complicated form.

In addition, we replace the ionic potential by a pseudopotential to eliminate the core

electrons from the theory. In principle the theory should be used with all electrons, but in

structure calculations the core electrons are passive and it is a computational waste to treat

them explicitly. We use a standard prescription for constructing the pseudopotentials of the

ions [22]. This procedure gives a pseudopotential that is nonlocal, depending on the orbital

angular momentum of the electron. This has consequences for the sum rules [23], but we

believe these are well under control [24]. Numerically, we implement the nonlocality using

a separable approximation as described by ref. [25].

3. Ground state

The ﬁrst part of the calculation is to construct the electronic ground state of the molecule

with the same LDA Hamiltonian that will be used for the time-dependent calculation. We

use an iterative conjugate-gradient method for this part of the calculation. Since the com-

putation time taken just a small fraction of the total (

10%), it was not worthwhile to

∼

optimize this step [26]. It is very useful to compute at the same time the energies of occupied

and unoccupied orbitals near the Fermi surface. Unlike the Hartree-Fock energies, the LDA

single-particle energy diﬀerences provide a good approximation to particle-hole excitation

energies in the molecules. The independent-particle model of the excitation spectrum is

based on these energies and the matrix elements of the independent particle-hole states.

6

4. Time-dependent equations

Once one has the wave functions for the occupied ground state orbitals φ(0)

i

, they are

perturbed by multiplying them by a phase factor,

φi(0) = eikxφ(0)
i

.

(3)

(4)

(5)

Physically, this gives the eﬀect of a short-duration electric ﬁeld acting on the electrons. The

wave functions are then evolved by the time-dependent equation of motion, eq. (2). Physical

observables are extracted from the time-dependent wave function by Fourier transformation.

A basic quantity to describe the molecule’s interactions is the dynamic polarizability α(ω).

This is essentially given by the Fourier transform of the time-dependent dipole moment:

α(ω) =

dt e−iωt

Another useful quantity is the strength function S(ω), whose integral is the total oscillator

strength. This is deﬁned

We shall use the symbol ne (eﬀective number of electrons) for integral of S when we consider

the excitation with a speciﬁc orientation of the electric ﬁeld with respect to the molecule.

The usual oscillator strength f is the same quantity averaged over molecular orientations.

The numerical integration requires as a parameter the time step ∆T over which the

single-particle Hamiltonian is treated as static. Within the time step the equations are

solved by a predictor-corrector method as described in ref. [19]. The required size of the

time step depends on the energy scale of the Hamiltonian. Thus one expects a dependence

∆T

(∆x)2. As a practical criterion, we determine ∆T by requiring the norm of the wave

∼

function to be accurately conserved. When that is the case, the energy is also conserved

to good accuracy. We found that ∆T = 0.001¯h/eV is needed for carbon structures with a

mesh size of ∆x = 0.3 ˚A.

7

Another numerical parameter is the length of the time integration T . The eﬀective

resolution of the strength function is determined by this quantity.

In the timing tests

we show below, the integration time is T = 10 ¯h/eV, corresponding to a resolution of

¯h/T = 0.1 eV. In the graphs of the strength functions shown later we have integrated to

T = 30

40 ¯h/eV, giving peaks having widths of less than 0.1 eV. Since the accuracy of

−

the TDLDA does not approach this value, there is no beneﬁt to integrate to longer times.

However, one must remember that the displayed strength functions have a spurious width

due to the ﬁnite integration time. In principle, the TDLDA strength function is inﬁnitely

sharp below the ionization threshold.

As mentioned earlier, an advantage of the real-time implementation of the TDLDA is

that the computing eﬀort scales with the number of particles N and the spatial dimension

a higher power, at least if one applies the methods naively without truncation of matrix

diagonalization or inversion operations. We have examined the scaling of our computation

time for the polyenes, which discussed in detail in Sec. 4 below. The crosses in Fig. 1

show the computation time to set up the ground state wave function for series ethylene,

butadiene, ...,C28H30, using 1500 iterations of the Kohn-Sham equations. The abscissa gives

the number of valence electrons in the calculation. The dashed line shows the dependence

according to t

N 2 scaling. One sees that the N 2 scaling applies quite nicely to the larger

∼

sized molecules1. The computation time for solving the time-dependent equation starting

from the ground state is shown by the open triangles in Fig. 1. Here we used 10,000 time

steps of 0.001 ¯h/eV to obtain the real-time response over an interval of 10 ¯h/eV. From the

ﬁgure, we see that the scaling is even a little weaker than N 2. In fact the number of points

particle orbitals, an operation that scales as N 3. Evidently, the prefactor for this operation is not

large enough to make it noticeable.

III. CARBON CHAINS

The ﬁrst carbon structures we applied the theory to are linear carbon chains. The results

were already reported in [8], but for completeness we summarize them here. In that study

we assumed that the chains were straight with evenly spaced carbon atoms. The interesting

quantities are the HOMO-LUMO gap

(6)

(7)

(8)

and the behavior of the collective π

π∗ excitation. The HOMO-LUMO gap for molecules

in the range C3-C20 is well described by the simple parameterization

∆e = eLU M O

−

−

∆e =

N + 1

with A = 17.5 eV for even chains and A = 16 eV for odd chains. This corresponds to the

H¨uckel model with a hopping parameter β = 2.8 eV. Experimentally, transitions have been

observed at these energies for even-N chains with 6

N

12.

≤

The TDLDA predicted that the collective excitation was a single, sharp state with a

energy that varies more slowly with N than eq. (7). A better ﬁt can be made with the

following functional form [27]

The large-N ﬁt to eq. (8) has A = 31.7 eV with no diﬀerence between odd and even N.

Conﬁguration-interaction quantum chemistry calculations have been done for N = 3, 5 and

7 [28,29], and the energies of the predicted collective excitations agree well with TDLDA.

Experimentally, transitions have been observed for odd-N molecules with N = 3, 7, 9, 11, 13

and 15. The systematics follows eq. (8) with a coeﬃcient that is 10% lower, C

28.3.

the number of atoms in the chain roughly as

1.6. This oscillator strength has a physical interpretation as the number of

electrons in the π manifold of states. For odd-N chains, that number is 2N

−

larger than eq. (9).

IV. POLYENES

We next consider the polyenes with alternating double and single bonds which have been

studied in empirical models [30] and well as with the linear response [4,5]. Unlike the small

carbon chains, the polyene bonds lengths are not equal. As a consequence the HOMO-

LUMO gap goes to a ﬁnite value rather than to zero as in eq. (7). Our structures have

bond lengths of 1.45 ˚A for C-C bonds and 1.34 ˚A for double C=C bonds, as is commonly

assumed2. The C=C-C and C=C-H bond angles are taken to be 124◦ and 119◦ respectively,

in the all-trans conformation. We ﬁrst discuss a typical case, C8H10. Fig. 2 shows on left the

energies of the π orbitals in the LDA calculation of the ground state. On the right-hand side

is the spectrum of the H¨uckel model which will be discussed below. Both the HOMO and

the LUMO are in the π manifolds indicated in the Figure; the HOMO-LUMO energy gap

is 2.58 eV in the LDA. The HOMO-LUMO transition has an oscillator strength of ne = 5.3

in the LDA. For comparison, the strength would be ne = 8 if that transition absorbed all of

the strength of the π manifold, since there are 8 electrons in the occupied π orbitals. The

35% reduction from the nominal value is more severe than in the carbon chains; evidently

the longer bond distances in the polyenes cause some fragmentation of the strength.

2However, ref. [4] quote a double C-C bond length of 1.544 ˚A.

10

Next we show in Fig. 3 the TDLDA response of C8H10 from zero energy to 30 eV

excitation. One sees the strong π

π∗ transition at 3.86 eV, with a strength ne = 3.9. The

−

slight reduction of strength compared to the single-electron picture is due to the screening

eﬀect of the σ electrons. In Fig. 3 one also sees the σ

σ∗ transitions as the broad distribution

−

between 10 and 20 eV. The strength integrated up to 30 eV is ne = 30; integrating up to 100

eV gives a strength of 41 which compares well to the number of valence electron in C8H10,

namely 42.

We next turn to the systematics as a function of the length of the polyene molecule. Fig. 4

shows the HOMO-LUMO gap and the excitation energy of the strong π

π∗ transition as a

−

function of the number of carbon atoms. The HOMO-LUMO gap systematics is compared

to two functional forms in the ﬁgure. The dot-dash line shows an N −1 dependence as in

eq. (7), which is clearly wrong. The dashed line is a ﬁt to the generalized H¨uckel model

with two hopping parameters βs and βd corresponding to the single and double CC bonds,

respectively. For the ﬁt, the parameter values are

βs =

2.27 eV and βd =

2.80 eV.

−

−

(10)

These are somewhat larger than the values assumed in ref. [30]. The ﬁt for the ﬁnite systems

is quite good, showing that rather simple considerations are suﬃcient to describe the Kohn-

Sham single particle energies. Our ﬁt parameters would give a band gap of 0.86 eV in

inﬁnitely long polyene molecules.

The collective transition in the TDLDA has more complex behavior for large polyenes.

We ﬁnd, unlike the carbon chains, that the π

π∗ strength is partly split in the larger

−

polyenes. This is shown in Fig. 5, showing the low-energy TDLDA strength function for

N=8,18, and 28. The systematics of the energy of the strongest states is also shown in Fig. 4

as the crosses. We have not found a theoretically motivated analytic parametrization for

the n-dependence of these transitions. The PPP empirical theory [30], when ﬁtted to the

smaller polyenes, gives too high an energy for the largest ones, as is shown by the dotted

line in Fig. 4.

In Fig. 6 we show the comparison with experiment and with the linear

11

response calculations of ref. [4,5]. The two calculations agree well with each other for the

lighter systems, but they severely diverge for the heavier molecules. In principle, the small-

amplitude TDLDA and the linear response are just diﬀerent mathematical formulations of

the same theory, and they should give the same results for the same Kohn-Sham energy

functional. Perhaps the diﬀerences are due to diﬀerent assumed bond lengths, as mentioned

in the footnote. The experimental data for polyenes in solution is shown by the crosses and

squares. There is also gas phase data quoted in ref. [5] which gives 10% higher energies.

From Fig. 6 one sees good agreement with the lighter polyenes, but the data falling between

the two theoretical calculations for the heavier ones.

The predicted transition strengths for the two calculations are also signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.

Fig. 7 shows the oscillator strengths in our calculation, compared to the nominal strength

in the π manifold. The HOMO-LUMO transition, shown by the triangles, has roughly half

the nominal strength. This is further decreased in the TDLDA by two eﬀects. One is the

screening by the σ electrons, and the other is the loss of strength in the heavier polyenes

to other states. In contrast, the calculation of [5] gave a collective transition with about

75% of the nominal strength for the heavier polyenes. The stronger collectivity then gives a

larger upper shift in the energy from the HOMO-LUMO gap position.

As a ﬁnal example closely related to the polyenes, we examine retinal, the molecule of

biological prominence as a retinyl chromophore. Retinal is more complicated than a polyene,

having an aromatic termination on one end and an carboxyl group on the other, but these

play a minor role in the collective longitudinal excitation. We consider the all-trans form,

which is the ﬁnal state of the chromophore having absorbed a photon. The experimental

data [33] on all-trans-retinal shows broad, asymmetric peak with a maximum at 3.2 eV and

a full width at half maximum of about 0.6 eV. There is a previous ab initio study using

the CASSCF method [34] which we can also compare to. In our calculation, the HOMO-

LUMO gap is 2.0 eV, and this state is very strong in the single-electron approximation.

The electron-electron interaction in the TDLDA shifts the center of gravity of the strength

up to 3.3 eV, close to the experimentally observed position. In contrast, the calculation of

12

ref. [34] obtained the strong transition at much higher energy. However, as may be seen

from Fig. 8, the TDLDA strength is fragmented into three states. The LDA predicts the

existence of a number of particle-hole states in the 3 eV energy region, and the residual

electron interaction is strong enough to mix them. The lowest predicted strong state, at 2.5

eV, is in a spectral region where the empirical absorption strength is small. This is similar

to the problem we had with the large polyenes. In the retinal case, however, the situation is

complicated by the presence of an oxygen atom on the molecule. As discussed in ref. [34], the

lowest excitation in the molecule has a predominant component with a hole at the oxygen.

We have not checked that our mesh size ∆x = 0.3 ˚A is small enough to describe oxygen

reliably, and that needs to be checked before making a ﬁnal conclusion on the accuracy

of the TDLDA for this system. The transition strength associated with the three strong

transitions is f = 1.7 in the TDLDA, which is close to the prediction of ref. [34], but twice

our extracted experimental value. That was obtained using the extinction coeﬃcient data

of ref. [33], correcting the solution data by the Debye factor [35].

V. SIMPLE AROMATIC MOLECULES

We discuss here the optical absorption spectra of benzene and C60.

A. Benzene

Benzene provides our best example of the TDLDA comparisons to experiment. For this

calculation, we take the empirical geometry of benzene, D6 symmetry with CC bond length

of 1.396 ˚A and CH bond length of 1.083 ˚A. The static LDA calculation gives an energy

spectrum with a gap ∆e of 5.04 eV. This may be compared with the empirical energy of the

1B2u excitation, which is a π

π∗ particle-hole state having a small residual interaction.

−

That energy is 4.9 eV [36], close to the LDA prediction. Other recent calculations of benzene

excitations have been made using the CASSFC and MRMP methods [37]. These authors

ﬁnd that the 1B2u is also well reproduced by the CASSFC but not so well by the MRMP.

13

Turning to the dynamic response, the TDLDA transition strength is shown in Fig. 10.

One sees the collective π

π∗ state as a narrow peak at 6.9 eV. Thus the residual interaction

pushes the π

π∗ strength up 1.9 eV from its original position at ∆e. Above 9 eV there is

−

−

a broad feature peaking around 18 eV. This is associated with the σ

σ∗ transitions; the

−

width is due to the high level density of particle-hole states in the region of the resonance,

and the fact that they are unbound. However, our implementation of TDLDA uses a ﬁnite

sized box, which does not give a satisfactory treatment of continuum eﬀects. This spectrum

was calculated putting an absorptive boundary condition on the wave function at the edge

of the box. Instead of the very ﬁne structure predicted with a reﬂecting boundary condition,

the absorptive evidence produces (spurious) broader structures.

To compare with the empirical strength function, we consider data reported in two

experiments.

In ref. [36], the absolute strength was measured for excitation energies up

to about 10 eV. There is a quite sharp state at 6.9 eV in very good agreement with our

predicted π

π∗ transition. Comparing with the other theoretical methods, the strong state

−

is well reproduced by the the MRMP but not the CASSCF [37]. The empirical strength

integrating the peak region from 6.5 eV up to the minimum at 8.3 eV is f = 0.9 eV. This

agrees well with our theoretical strength for the collective transition, f = 1.1. Here both the

CASSCF and MRMP give even better agreement with experiment. We mention that none

of the theories describe the ﬁner details of the absorption spectrum around the 6.9 eV peak,

which has an asymmetric tail and a small peak on the low-energy side. Since theory predicts

a single sharp state, it is clear that other degrees of freedom, probably the vibrational, are

responsible for the detailed structure of the peak. The experimental strength function also

show very ﬁne peaks in the neighborhood of the ionization energy. These are Rydberg states

which are beyond the reach of simple energy densities functions, which lack the Coulomb

tail in the mean ﬁeld. Another experiment [38] reported the absorption strength going up to

much higher energies, but without an absolute normalization. In Fig. 10 we show this data

normalized to our calculation. We see that broad σ

σ∗ feature is reproduced in position

and width very well. However as mentioner, ﬁne details of the spectrum are not properly

−

14

reproduced.

VI. C60

Our last example is the molecule C60. This molecule has been well studied in the LDA;

the predicted HOMO-LUMO gap is 1.65 eV, compared with the measured gap of

1.6 eV.

∼

The strength function computed with the TDLDA is shown in Fig. 11. We see a set of strong

transitions in the region 4-7 eV excitation, and a much larger and broad set in the region

of 15-30 eV. The lower transitions have a π

π∗character. Experimentally, the absorption

−
strength below 6 eV has been measured in absolute terms and the data is reviewed in ref. [39].

Comparison of theory and experiment is made in Table I. There is a good correspondence

between the TDLDA transition at 3.4 eV and the observed state at 3.8 eV. For the higher

transitions, theory predicts more strong states than the number of peaks observed, so there

is no one-to-one correspondence. However, the overall strength distribution comes out fairly

well. This may be seen in Fig. 12 comparing the integrated strength distribution up to 6.2

eV. Of course the TDLDA strength is sharply peaked without the line-broadening processes

that would be computable in a more complete theory. The total strength in the region comes

out about right in TDLDA, but shifts of the order of 0.5 eV would be required to ﬁt the

data.

The strong absorption between 15 and 30 eV is due to σ

σ∗ transitions. Of course,

−

the sharp structures predicted in the TDLDA would be smeared out due to coupling to

the continuum and to vibrations. The only data in this region is the photoelectron cross

sections [40]. It shows a peak at 20 eV having a full width at half maximum of about 10

eV, consistent with the TDLDA results.

The TDLDA is an attractive theory for collective excitations in large molecules because

of its numerical scaling properties, and its automatic compliance with sum rules. We have

found it to be rather good for conjugated carbon molecules, giving a reasonable account of

the strong transitions in both the π

π∗ and σ

σ∗ manifolds of states.

−

−

In the π

π∗ manifold, the energetics of the underlying single-particle states are fairly

−

well described by the H¨uckel Hamiltonian. The results are summarized in Fig. 13, showing

the deduced hopping matrix elements as a function of the CC bond length. Fitting the

conjugated molecules to a power law dependence on bond length, the extracted matrix

elements vary as t

r−2.7. This is a stronger dependence than the commonly assumed

form, t

r−2. The matrix element for the carbon chain molecules is quite diﬀerent, perhaps

∼

∼

because of the absence of hydrogen atoms.

As is well known, the electron-electron interaction strongly perturbs the absorption

strength function. In the region of the π

π∗ transitions, the strength is shifted upward by

−

−

an amount of the order of 1-2 eV for the systems studied. In the case of carbon chains, the

transition energy can be described fairly well analytically. The energies agree well with the

empirical values for the smaller molecules, but the larger ones are predicted to have more

fragmentation of strength in the TDLDA than is observed. The amount of strength in the

π∗ transition in principle depends on the coupling to the other electrons. In small or

π

−

extended molecules, the coupling and resulting screening is rather mild, less than a factor

of two. On the other hand, in C60 the π

π∗ transition strength is more strongly screened.

The absorption spectra typically have a gap above the the strong π

π∗ transition, followed

by a dense spectrum of σ

σ∗ transitions above 10 eV. This spectrum peaks in the range

−

of 15-20 eV and is quite broad. This feature is present in the empirical absorption, but

quantitative experimental data is only available for one case, benzene. There we found good

agreement on the overall shape and size of the σ

σ∗ absorption peak.

In view of the

−

evident success of the TDLDA theory, it would be interesting to consider more ambitious

applications. One direction is to try other, more diﬃcult, elements. In particular, it may be

possible to treat d-shell elements with mesh sizes of the order of ∆x

0.2 ˚A, which would

allow small molecules and clusters to be calculated. Another direction would be to study

the eﬀect of perturbations on the spectra. Possible perturbations include: nearby charges

We show that electronic-entropy eﬀects in the size-
evolutionary patterns of relatively small (as small as 20
atoms), simple-metal clusters become prominent already at
moderate temperatures. Detailed agreement between our
ﬁnite-temperature-shell-correction-method calculations and
experimental results is obtained for certain temperatures.
This agreement includes a size-dependent smearing out of
ﬁne-structure features, accompanied by a measurable reduc-
tion of the heights of the steps marking major-shell and sub-
shell closings, thus allowing for a quantitative analysis of clus-
ter temperatures.

Since the discovery [1] of electronic-shell-structure fea-
tures in the abundance spectra of sodium clusters, sim-
ilar features (the major ones corresponding to the de-
generacies of a spherically symmetric mean-ﬁeld po-
in the
[2,3]) have been routinely observed [4]
tential
size-evolutionary patterns (SEP’s) associated with other
single-particle properties of both alkali- and noble-metal
clusters. Speciﬁcally, such patterns pertain to ioniza-
tion potentials (IP’s) [5–7], electron aﬃnities (EA’s) [8,9],
monomer separation energies (MSE’s) [10], and ﬁssion
dissociation energies [11].

It was early realized [12] that the secondary features in
the mass spectra required consideration of deformed clus-
ter shapes [5,12]. When triaxial (ellipsoidal) shapes were
considered in the framework of Shell Correction Methods
(SCM) [13–16], substantial overall systematic agreement
was achieved [14,15] between theory and experimental
observations pertaining to the major and the ﬁne struc-
ture of the aforementioned SEP’s.

While deformation eﬀects have been extensively stud-
ied, an understanding of the physical origins of thermal
eﬀects and their relation to the SEP’s is still lacking, even
though the experiments are necessarily made with clus-
ters at ﬁnite temperatures. Moreover, experimental de-
termination of cluster temperatures remains a challenge,
motivating the development of theoretical methods capa-
ble of extracting such information.

While thermodynamic entropic contributions associ-
ated with the ionic degrees of
freedom can be ob-
tained from ﬁrst-principles molecular-dynamics simula-
tions [17,18], or from considerations of shape ﬂuctuations
in simpler models [19–21], for suﬃciently large simple-
metal clusters MN with N > 20, the electronic entropy

(which has not as yet been included in such studies) dom-
inates the thermal characteristics of the shell structure,
even at moderate temperatures. The prominent thermal
eﬀects associated with the electronic entropy are the fo-
cus of this paper.

Without the simultaneous consideration of shape ﬂuc-
tuations, thermal eﬀects pertaining to the electronic de-
grees of freedom and their relevance for the understand-
ing of mass abundance spectra have been considered in
the case of spherical neutral sodium clusters [22], and in
a recent report [23] on the thermodynamics of neutral
sodium clusters with axially symmetric shapes. In con-
trast to our ﬁndings, these studies have suggested that
electronic-entropy eﬀects at moderate temperatures are
not important for clusters with less than 100 atoms.

The theoretical method used in this paper is a ﬁnite-
temperature (FT) –SCM developed by us, which incorpo-
rates all three of the aforementioned aspects, namely, tri-
axial deformations, entropy of the electrons, and thermal
eﬀects originating from shape ﬂuctuations. Furthermore,
through a direct comparison with experimental measure-
ments, we demonstrate that this method can be employed
for determining cluster temperatures.

Since the number of delocalized valence electrons is
ﬁxed for a given cluster, M x±
N , we need to use [24,25] the
canonical ensemble in calculating their thermodynamical
properties. For determining the free energy, F (β, N, x)
(β = 1/T ), which incorporates the electronic entropy, we
separate it, in analogy with the zero-temperature limit
[14], into a smooth, liquid-drop-model part,
FLDM, and
a Strutinsky-type [26] shell-correction term, ∆Fsh. The
shell correction term is speciﬁed as the diﬀerence ∆Fsh =
Fsp −
Fsp, where Fsp is the canonical free energy of the
valence electrons viewed as independent single particles
in their eﬀective mean-ﬁeld potential. For calculating
the canonical Fsp, we adopt a number-projection method
[27], according to which

The LDM term

FLDM consists of three contributions;
a volume, a surface, and a curvature term. Since vol-
ume conservation during deformation is assumed, we
need not consider the temperature dependence of the
corresponding term when calculating observables, such
as IP’s and MSE’s, associated with processes which do
not change the total number of atoms, N . The exper-
imental temperature dependence of the surface tension,
σ(T ) = c0 − c1(T − Tmp), is taken from standard tables
[29] (Tmp are melting-point temperatures [30]), but nor-
malized to yield the σ(T = 0) value used in our earlier
calculations [14]. Since no experimental information is
available regarding the curvature coeﬃcient, Ac, we as-
sume the same relative temperature dependence as for
σ(T ) normalized to the T = 0 value used earlier [14]. Fi-
nally, the expansion of the Wigner-Seitz radius due to the
temperature is determined according to the coﬃcient of
linear thermal expansion [30]. With these modiﬁcations,
the remaining steps in the calculation of
FLDM follow
closely section II.A. of Ref. [14] (for simplicity, the work
function W is assumed temperature independent).

According to the general theory of thermal ﬂuctuating
phenomena [31], the triaxial shapes of the clusters, speci-
ﬁed by the βH and γH Hill-Wheeler parameters [32], will
explore [33] the free-energy surface, F (β, N, x; βH , γH ),
with a probability,

P (βH , γH ) = Z −1 exp[−βF (β, N, x; βH , γH )] ,

the quantity Z being the classical Boltzmann-type par-
tition function,

Z =

dτ exp[−βF (β, N, x; βH , γH )] ,

Z

and dτ = β4
H | sin(3γH )|dβH dγH the proper volume ele-
ment [34]. Thus, ﬁnally, the free energy, hF (β, N, x)i,
averaged over the shape ﬂuctuations can be written as

hF (β, N, x)i =

dτ F (β, N, x; βH , γH )P (βH , γH) .

We will present results pertaining to IP’s and MSE’s

Our calculations (solid dots) for the IP’s of KN clusters
for three temperatures, T = 10 K, 300 K, and 500 K, are
displayed in Fig. 1, and are compared with the experi-
mental measurements [5] (open squares; the experimen-
tal uncertainties are 0.06 eV for N ≤ 30 and 0.03 eV for
N > 30). As was the case with our earlier T = 0 K results
[14], the T = 10 K theoretical results exhibit the follow-
ing two characteristics: (i) Above N = 21, a pronounced
ﬁne structure between major-shell closures which is not
present in the experimental measurements; (ii) Steps at
the major-shell closures which are much larger than the
experimental ones [35] (three-to-ﬁve times for N = 40,
58, and 92, and two-to-three times for N = 8 and 20).

The agreement between theory and experiment is sig-
niﬁcantly improved at T = 300 K. Indeed, in comparison
with the lower-temperature calculations, the T = 300
K results exhibit the following remarkable changes: (i)
Above N = 21, the previously sharp ﬁne-structure fea-
tures are smeared out, and as a result, the theoretical
curve follows closely the smooth modulations of the ex-
perimental proﬁle. In the size range N = 21 − 34, three
rounded, hump-like formations (ending to the right at
the subshell closures at N = 26, 30, and 34) survive in
very good agreement with the experiment (the sizes of
the drops at N = 26, 30 and 34 are comparable to the
experimental ones [36]); (ii) The sizes of the IP drops at
N = 20, 40, 58, and 92 are reduced drastically and are
now comparable to the experimental ones.
In the size
range N ≤ 20, the modiﬁcations are not as dramatic.
Indeed, one can clearly see that the pattern of odd-even
alternations remains well deﬁned, but with a moderate
attenuation in amplitude, again in excellent agreement
with the experimental observation.

For T = 500 K, the smearing out of the shell structure
progresses even further, obliterating the agreement be-
tween theory and experiment. Speciﬁcally, the steps at
the subshell closures at N = 26 and 30, as well as at the
major-shell closures at N = 40, 58, and 92 are rounded
and smeared out over several clusters (an analogous be-
havior has been observed in the logarithmic abundance
spectra of hot, singly cationic, copper, silver, and gold
clusters [37]). At the same time, however, the odd-even
alternation remains well deﬁned for N ≤ 8. We fur-
ther notice that, while some residue of ﬁne structure sur-
vives in the range N = 9 − 15, the odd-even alternations
there are essentially absent (certain experimental mea-
surements [38] of the IP’s of hot NaN clusters appear to
conform to this trend).

To ascertain the relative weight of the two thermal pro-
cesses incorporated in our FT-SCM, we display in the
middle panel of Fig. 1 (uppermost curve with open cir-
cles) the theoretical IP’s at T = 300 K in the case when
the electronic entropy is neglected. A comparison with
the results (solid dots) when both electronic and shape-
ﬂuctuations entropic contributions are included demon-

2

strates the principal role of the electronic entropy in shap-
ing the thermal eﬀects of the SEP’s.

Fig. 2 displays for two temperatures (10 K and 300 K)
the FT-SCM results (solid dots) for the MSE’s associated
with the K+
N clusters, along with available experimental
measurements [10] (open squares) in the size range N =
4−23. Compared to the T = 10 K results, the theoretical
results at T = 300 K are in better agreement with the
experimental ones due to an attenuation of the amplitude
of the alternations (e.g., notice the favorable reduction in
the size of the drops at N = 9, 15, and 21). In spite of this
amplitude attenuation, it is remarkable that the T = 300
K SCM results in this size range preserve in detail the
same relative pattern as the T = 10 K ones (in particular,
the well-deﬁned odd-even oscillations in the range N =
4 − 15 and the ascending quartet at N = 16 − 19 followed
by a dip at N = 20).

As a last example, Fig. 3 displays for three temper-
atures (10 K, 800 K, and 2000 K) our FT-SCM results
for the IP’s of AgN clusters, and compares them with
available experimental measurements [6,39]. Again, go-
ing from the T = 10 K to the T = 800 results, we ob-
serve that an attenuation of the amplitude of alternations
brings theory and experiment in better agreement (e.g.,
in the latter case, the sizes of the theoretical IP drops at
N = 6, 8, 14, 20, 26, 30, and 34 are comparable to the
experimental ones). Finally, at T = 2000 K, both major
and ﬁne structure tend to vanish for N > 8.

In conclusion, we showed that the SEP’s of the single-
particle properties of simple-metal clusters are governed
by the interplay of ellipsoidal deformations and ther-
modynamics (entropy) of the electronic degrees of free-
dom, while the entropic contribution of shape ﬂuctua-
tions plays a smaller role [40]. We further demonstrated
that electronic-entropy eﬀects are reﬂected in prominent
experimental signatures already at moderate tempera-
tures and for relatively small sizes. This behavior, which
had not been previously understood in the case of metal
clusters, correlates with an order-of-magnitude estimate
[34] from theoretical nuclear physics. Accordingly, the
shell-correction term in the free energy depends on T as
∆Fsh(T ) = ∆Fsh(0)τ / sinh τ , which for τ > 1 takes the
form 2∆Fsh(0)τ exp(−τ ) with τ = 2π2T /(¯hωsh), with
¯hωsh being the energy spacing between shells. Because of
the large 2π2 factor, the shell-structure eﬀects decrease
rapidly, even for temperatures that are only a fraction
of the shell spacing (see p. 608 of Ref. [34]). Thus,
the shell structure “melts” for temperatures as low as
T /(¯hωsh) = 0.25 [41]. The FT-SCM calculations pre-
sented here correspond to temperature ranges well below
this ratio, where analysis of the extent of attenuation of
shell-structure signatures allows determination of cluster
temperatures.

Compared to nuclear and atomic physics, which have
heretofore provided the prototypes for fermionic shell
structure, the SEP’s of metal clusters stand apart, since

the experimentally available SEP’s of nuclei (e.g., those
of neutron separation energies [42]) and of atoms (i.e.,
IP’s [42]) correspond strictly to zero-temperature. Fi-
nally, it is natural to conjecture that thermal (in partic-
ular, electronic-entropy) eﬀects will inﬂuence the height
of ﬁssion barriers and fragmentation channels [43].

[39] At large N , the quoted experimental values appear to
converge to the value of an eﬀective work function, Weﬀ,
which is by ∼ 0.8 eV systematically higher than the mea-
sured polycrystalline one (W = 4.26 eV), which was used
in our calculations. Indeed, the low-temperature mea-
surements for the IP’s of AgN clusters given in Ref. [7]
converge to W = 4.26 eV.

[40] In other instances, e.g., the widths of collective plasma
excitations, shape ﬂuctuations may play a larger role (see
Ref. [33]).

[41] This ratio reduces the shell structure in the free energy by
a factor larger than 10; shell-structure eﬀects in the IP’s
and MSE’s result from diﬀerences between two adjacent
∆Fsh’s and decrease even faster.

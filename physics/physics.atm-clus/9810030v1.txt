Abstract

Energies and spatial observables for the 1Σg state of the hydrogen molecule in mag-

netic ﬁelds parallel to the proton-proton axis are calculated with a guided random walk

Feynman-Kac algorithm. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the results and simplicity

of the method may prove it a viable alternative to large basis set expansions for small

molecules in applied ﬁelds.

1.Introduction

The physics of the H2 molecule in magnetic ﬁelds is a problem of interest in molecular

physics [1,2], astrophysics [3], and to some extent in condensed matter physics [4]. A series

of papers examining H2 in magnetic ﬁelds parallel to the proton-proton axis have recently

been published [5,6]. These papers use basis set expansions to compute potential energy

curves and equilibrium values of the proton-proton radial separation for several of the low

lying states of the molecule. While this program has been succesful, it is useful to have

alternate methods that have their own advantages. Work has been done on this problem

with a ﬁxed phase Monte Carlo algorithm [7] that is general and may prove to be the

eventual method of choice for other molecules in magnetic ﬁelds. Here however we have

chosen a guided random walk Feynman-Kac (GRWFK) algorithm [8,9,10] because of it’s

ease of implementation and extension to other molecular systems. GRWFK also has the

advantage of avoiding trial wavefunction contamination of quantities calculated with the

method.

This brief report is organized as follows: In section 2 we give an outline of the calcu-

lational method. In section 3 we apply the method to the 1Σg state of H2 in a magnetic

ﬁeld. Section 4 presents results for the energies and electronic

i
for some representative ﬁelds. Section 5 is reserved for conclusions.

2. Calculational method

We give a brief discussion of the calculational method for one dimensional systems.

The extension to higher dimensionality is very simple and is an advantage of the formalism.
The Feynman-Kac formula [11,12] for a walker starting a walk at x′, T ′ = 0, 0 is

U (x, T, x′ = 0, T ′ = 0) =

ds V (B(s) + x)

=

Ψn(x)Ψn(0)e−EnT .

U (x, T, 0, 0) is the Euclidian quantum mechanical propagator and the brackets denote an

expectation value over the Weiner measure [13]. The argument of the exponential is an

integral of the potential along a Gaussian process of mean zero and variance one [14] (we

choose this as a Bernoulli sequence of plus and minus ones). Computationally this amounts

to evaluating

with T1, T2, two suﬃciently large times.

It is known the F-K formula as written in eq.(1) and it’s discretized form in eq.(2) are

formally correct but plagued by slow convergence and large variance when employed for

numerical work. There are many schemes in the literature that address this problem. Here

we adopt a method that has the advantage of simplicity and adaptability to parallelization.

An unconstrained random walk has equal probability P = 1

2 to step left or right. The

probability distribution ρ(x, τ + ∆τ ) for the arrival of a walker at x, τ is

ρ(x, τ + ∆τ ) =

ρ(x

ρ(x + ∆x, τ ).

Ψ2) knowledge of the solution of eq.(6) give would the

exact guiding function g(x) and vice-versa. Of course U is not generally known, but by

choosing g(x) to incorporate what is known about the general character of the solution the

variance of calculated observables can be reduced and convergence to the ﬁnal result can be

substantially improved. In what follows we evaluate eq.(7) with conditional probabilities

given by eq.(5), and use Ω(x) rather than V (x) as the argument of the exponential in eq.(2).

It is worth noting that we do not generate random walks on a three dimensional grid for

each particle but rather as three separate one dimensional grids. This is why the three

It is straightforward to insert the Ψt of eq. (11) into the expression for g to obtain

Ω and the modiﬁed walk probabilities. We note in passing that this choice amounts to a

baseline level trial function. No a priori attempt was made to include free parameters for

later optimization.

4. Results

In table 1 we give E0 in atomic units for several values of γ at the indicated Req. We

also give E0 for γ = 2.127207 at Req = 1.07 a.u. There are two values in the literature for

E0 at this ﬁeld strength [6,15]. Our value conﬁrms the result of Detmer et. al. in [6].

These results show good agreement with [6] for the relatively small number of sample

paths considered here. The value n = 800 was arrived at by starting at n = 200 and

increasing n by 100 steps per run for a few thousand sample paths. n = 500 was found to

be suﬃcient for all γ considered. 300 more steps were added as a check on the stability

of convergence. We give the results for the larger n. A similar method was employed for

the determination of T1 and T2. (We did not include disassociation values since they were
√r2

also the same as those given in [6].) In table 2 we show results for calculations of

i
for some values of γ. We were interested in the value of the ﬁeld for which the rms value

h

equaled the proton’s separation believing this to be a reasonable albeit naive measure of

the onset of the transition to the free atomic limit. Clearly the ﬁeld value at which this

would occur is large enough to align the spins making the triplet rather than the singlet

state the correct state to investigate. It should be noted that the times T1 and T2 that

give convergence of E0 usually were not suﬃcient to converge

. This is reﬂected in

√r2

h

i

the larger values of T1 and T2 in table 2.

5. Conclusions

The accuracy of the GRWFK method for this problem suggests that faster convergence

with basis set expansions might be achieved with LCAO trial wavefunctions functions

multiplied by oscillator eigenstates. This is a direction best explored by those working

already with that method. Certainly basis sets expansions prove (at least for ﬁxed nuclei)

a superior method for digit aquisition than Monte Carlo methods. The trade oﬀ between

accuracy and ease of implementaion for molecules like H3 or even H3

+ in a magnetic ﬁeld

is an open question.

Calculating the properties of low-lying excited states is not unfeasable but is known

to be limited by the (lack of) knowledge of the nodal structure of the state [16,17]. The

ﬁxed node method [18,19] has been shown as a good approximation for small molecular

systems [20]. For biased random walks the nodal structure can be built into the the trial

functions although not without increased complexity. Clearly states of non-zero orbital

angular momentum will have to be considered by incorporating the techniques discussed

in [7] to GRWFK. This is a topic of current investigation.

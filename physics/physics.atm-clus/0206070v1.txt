Calculating the energy absorption of atomic clusters as a function of the laser pulse length T we
can be linked to an optimal cluster radius
ﬁnd a maximum for a critical T
R
. The existence of this radius can be attributed to the enhanced ionization mechanism origi-
nally discovered for diatomic molecules. Our ﬁndings indicate that enhanced ionization should be
operative for a wide class of rare gas clusters. From a simple Coulomb explosion ansatz, we derive
an analytical expression relating the maximum energy release to a suitably scaled expansion time

which can be expressed with the pulse length T

After a basic understanding of the mechanisms gov-
erning atoms and molecules subjected to an intense laser
pulse [1, 2], analogous studies on clusters pioneered
by Rhodes [3] and Ditmire [4] have appeared over the
last years with a recent spectacular culmination in the
demonstration of deuterium fusion in clusters [5]. Most
of these studies do focus on the situation after the laser
pulse, namely on the abundance and kinetic energy spec-
tra of electrons and ions. Some discussion has been de-
voted to the question if the expansion of the cluster is
driven by hydrodynamics or by a Coulomb explosion.
Only very little attention has been paid to this type of
dynamics in the time domain [6, 7]. This is even more
surprising since the time scales involved show that the
expansion of the nuclei occurs on the same time scale
as the pulse lengths which can be chosen, namely some
10 to 1000 fs, or roughly 10−3 atomic units (which we
will use hereafter). Apart from the nuclear motion and
the pulse length T energy absorption from a laser pulse
and subsequent ionization and fragmentation of the clus-
ter involve two additional time scales, the optical cycle
2π/ω = 0.055a.u. for the typically used Titan-Sapphire
laser of 800 nm wavelength, and the period of the bound
electrons, which is of the order (hydrogen) of 1 a.u..
1016
We will work with peak intensities between 1014
W/cm2.
In the following we will demonstrate that the seemingly
complicated process of energy absorption and fragmen-
tation in the laser pulse can be split into three diﬀerent
phases, an ‘atomic ’ phase I, a ‘molecular’ phase II, and a
relaxation phase III. Phase I lasts for a time T0 after the
pulse has begun and is characterized by boiling oﬀ elec-
trons through multiphoton or tunneling ionization, hence
we have termed it ‘atomic’ phase. We deﬁne it to last un-
til every second atom in the cluster has lost one electron,
or equivalently until the probability of loosing an elec-
tron in an atom has reached p = 1/2. This probability
is calculated from a Krainov tunneling rate [8] where,
however, the instant electric ﬁeld is formed by the laser
and eventually already existing charged particles in the
cluster.

−

Up to T0 we may assume that the atoms/ions have not
moved yet. The second, molecular phase is characterized
by Coulomb explosion of the cluster. During this phase,
as we will show below, the cluster expands to a critical
radius R∗ which optimizes the energy absorption. Phase
III ﬁnally, until the end of the laser pulse and beyond,
sees a relaxation of the system and the full fragmenta-
tion of the cluster proceeding. The existence of these
phases follows from a careful analysis of our numerical
results. The relevance of the phases is underlined by the
time which is spent under phase II. This time turns out
to be instrumental for relating the electron release quan-
titatively to the laser and cluster properties, as will be
shown below.

To simulate the process of energy absorption numeri-
cally we have developed a quasiclassical model for small
rare gas clusters. The nuclei are treated completely clas-
sically, with the initial conﬁguration deﬁned by minimiz-
ing the pairwise Lennard-Jones interactions [9]. Elec-
trons bound to an atom or ion at position ~R are charac-
terized by an eﬀective binding energy

where the exact atomic binding energy EAtom
is shifted
by Vtotal, the sum of the potentials from the laser ﬁeld
and all other charged particles except the atom/ion the
electron is bound to. Ionization from such a bound state

with the classical Kepler period TK of an orbit with bind-
ing energy EAtom
. For each time step dt, a random num-
ber z is compared to the probability w(t) dt for ionization
during this time step. If w dt > z, the electron is born as
a classical particle and placed at the outer turning point
r2 obeying total energy conservation. From then on, this
electron follows Newton’s equations, and the next bound
electron can be ionized. Hence, strictly sequential ion-
ization is enforced.

The interaction between two particles with charge Q1
and Q2 and position vectors ~r1 and ~r2, respectively, is
described with a smoothed Coulomb potential

where the ai are charge-dependent soft-core parameters.
For electrons we used a(
1) = 0.1, while the ionic ai are
chosen such that the potential minima for each ion always
coincide with the quantum mechanical binding energy.
This choice prevents artiﬁcial classical autoionization.

−

The model allows us to follow the full time-dependent
evolution of the cluster with all interactions for a long
time (105 a.u.) to investigate the inﬂuence of the clus-
ter expansion during the laser pulse on its energy ab-
sorption. Although it implies, e.g. for xenon clusters,
to propagate up to 200 charged particles, the computa-
tion can be handled with moderate resources due to the
crucial simpliﬁcation which arises from treating bound
electronic motion not explicitly.

T

After the pulse is over the electron release from the
cluster is a typical observable which changes as a func-
tion of the pulse length T as shown in Fig. 1 for a Xe16
cluster in comparison with the corresponding electron re-
lease (i.e., ionization) of a Xe atom. The energy content
0 F (t)2dt has been kept constant
=
of the laser pulse
E
which means that the peak intensity F 2
0 of the pulse with
R
2
(πt/T ) cos ωt decreases with in-
amplitude F (t) = F0 sin
creasing pulse length T according to F 2
1/T . As a
0
reference for this energy normalization we chose a pulse
with F0 = 0.16 a.u. and a pulse length of 20 optical cy-
cles. One sees that the ionization of an atom increases
towards shorter pulse lengths T or equivalently, higher
peak intensity. Indeed, atomic ionization depends on the
peak intensity F 2
0 rather than on the pulse length T which
is obvious if the electron yield is dominated by sequential
ionization depending exponentially on F0 via the Krainov
rate [8], but only linearly on the pulse length. The os-
cillations in the single atom case are due to the atomic
shell structure.

∝

For the cluster the situation is quite diﬀerent: for short
T (high intensity F 2
0 ) the electron release/atom follows
that of an isolated atom. In fact, it is even slightly lower
than in the atomic case, due to the much larger Coulomb
ﬁeld of a multiply ionized cluster which has not signiﬁ-
cantly expanded. However, the electron release increases

again and reaches a maximum for some optimum pulse
length T ∗ at considerably smaller peak intensity. Hence,
the cluster expansion plays an important role for the en-
ergy absorption, in contrast to the atom for which this
degree of freedom does not exist. A comparison of time
scales shows, that indeed the Coulomb explosion of the
ions in the cluster happens on the same time scale as the
pulse duration (103
104 a.u. or equivalently some 10
to 100 fs). Hence, the dependence of the electron release
on T points to the spatial expansion of the cluster which
may in turn exhibit a maximum electron release for a
certain cluster radius R. We deﬁne R in terms of the
averaged distance between two ions in the cluster,

First we assess the inﬂuence of the size of the cluster on
the electron release under the reference pulse of 20 ﬁeld
cycles. The size of the cluster is varied preserving its
shape by scaling the ionic positions ~Rλ
i with a
factor λ compared to the equilibrium positions ~R0
i . As
can be seen from Fig. 2, a critical value of the mean
interionic distance, R∗ = λ∗R0 exists, where the ioniza-
tion yield shows a maximum. The position of R∗ hardly
changes upon variation of the laser frequency. The ioniza-
tion yield, however, increases with increasing frequency:
this is due to the smaller ponderomotive oscillation am-
plitude at higher frequencies, which leads to increased in-
teraction between quasi free electrons driven by the laser
ﬁeld and those still well in reach of the cluster ions.

The mechanism responsible for the existence of R∗
was ﬁrst identiﬁed in diatomic molecules under the name
CREI or enhanced ionization (ENIO) [10, 11] with the
(linear) laser polarization parallel to the molecular axis.
It might seem astonishing that the cluster also exhibits
ENIO although there is no preferred axis which could
align with the polarization axis. This is even more sur-
prising since no enhancement was found for diatomic
molecules if the polarization is perpendicular to the
molecular axis or if the laser is circularly polarized. How-

ever, a distinct feature of ENIO is the insensitivity to
changes in the laser frequency which we also ﬁnd in the
cluster (Fig. 2). This fact, together with the relation
of T ∗ to the critical radius R∗ as presented below pro-
vide suﬃcient evidence that intense laser ﬁeld dynamics
of clusters is structured by ENIO as is the corresponding
dynamics of molecules. For clusters, ENIO is even more
general since there is no restriction with respect to the
polarization of the laser: The direction of the axis for lin-
ear polarization does not matter and ENIO also occurs
for circular polarization as shown in Fig. 3.

Our ﬁndings exempliﬁed here for Xe16 have been con-
ﬁrmed by extensive calculations for a number of clusters
of 8 to 30 atoms for the elements Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe.
These calculations clearly demonstrate that ENIO plays
an important role for small rare gas clusters under in-
tense laser ﬁelds with quantitative consequences as we
will see next.

One could think that the relation of T ∗ and R∗ is di-
rectly given by the Coulomb explosion mechanism. The
latter links indeed R∗ to a certain time interval τ , but
not to the entire pulse length T ∗. The reason lies in
the existence of the diﬀerent phases as described in the
beginning and schematically shown in Fig. 4.

Only phase II drives the relevant Coulomb explosion,

namely the onset of the cluster expansion. For the maxi-
mum electron release this time interval ends if the critical
radius R∗ is reached at half the pulse length T ∗/2 when
the laser pulse intensity has its maximum. The interval
begins, however, only at T0 when each atom in the clus-
ter has on average a 50% probability of being ionized. At
this time the cluster still has its equilibrium radius R0.
Hence, we get τ = T ∗/2
T ∗
0 as the relevant time during
which the cluster expands from R0 to R∗.

−

Having identiﬁed phase II and its time interval τ as the
one which controls the maximum number Q∗ of released
electrons, we can use the dynamics of Coulomb explosion
to derive a quantitative relation between Q∗ and the op-
timum pulse length T ∗. To this end we assume that the
ionic motion in τ can be described by an averaged ionic
charge which is proportional to the averaged ﬁnal charge
of each atom in the cluster, i.e.

Qi = αQ∗/N,

(6)

where N is the number of atoms in the cluster. Further-
more we assume that in phase II the main kinetic energy
goes into the expansion of the cluster without changing
its shape. Using the same parameterization as before,
we write now for the time-dependent position ~Ri(t) of
an atom or ion ~Ri(t) = λ(t) ~R0
i is the equilib-
rium position of the atom before expansion, i.e., at time
i(d ~Ri(t)/dt)2

between the static ENIO mechanism at R∗ and its dy-

interval τ = T ∗/2

The proportionality factor in Eq. (6) determines the
fraction of the ﬁnal charge by which the expansion from
R0 to R∗ during phase II is eﬀectively driven. If phase
II is indeed the crucial dynamical time span which uni-
versally controls the electron release we expect α to be
the same for all types of clusters we consider, indepen-
dent of the atomic element or cluster size. Under this
assumption, we predict from Eq. (10) a linear relation
between the expansion time τ and (K0/V0)1/2f (λ). In
Fig. 5 we can see that this prediction is actually very

4

good: shown are the expansion times τ as a function of
the cluster-dependent values of (K0/V0)1/2f (λ) for dif-
ferent clusters. A linear ﬁt to the data yields α = 0.38
and α = 0.37 for energy normalized pulses at F0 = 0.16
and F0 = 0.25, respectively. The correlation coeﬃcient is
in both cases higher than 0.99. Hence, α is the same for
diﬀerent clusters, and it is almost the same for diﬀerent
energy normalizations of the laser pulse.

To summarize, we have shown that the enhanced ion-
ization mechanism is operative for small rare gas clus-
ters over a wide range of parameters. Moreover, from
a careful analysis of the Coulomb explosion process, we
conclude that energy absorption and subsequent ioniza-
tion of the cluster proceeds in a very similar way for dif-
ferent clusters, irrespectively of the number and sort of
atoms in the cluster. It is only for large rare gas clusters,
103 or more, that we expect a transition to a
with N
nanoplasma behavior, as it has been found in hydrody-
namical simulations of such systems [4, 12]. Where and
how this transition happens will be the subject of further
studies as well as the connection with enhanced energy
absorption recently reported for small metal clusters [13].

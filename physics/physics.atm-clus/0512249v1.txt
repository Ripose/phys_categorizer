Nonlinear resonance absorption in laser-cluster interaction

(Dated: February 20, 2014)

Rare gas or metal clusters are known to absorb laser energy very eﬃciently. Upon cluster ex-
pansion the Mie plasma frequency may become equal to the laser frequency. This linear resonance
has been well studied both experimentally and theoretically employing pump probe schemes. In
this work we focus on the few-cycle regime or the early stage of the cluster dynamics where linear
resonance is not met but nevertheless eﬃcient absorption of laser energy persists. By retrieving
time-dependent oscillator frequencies from particle-in-cell simulation results, we show that nonlin-
ear resonance is the dominant mechanism behind outer ionization and energy absorption in near
infrared laser-driven clusters.

The construction of laser-based table-top sources of en-
ergetic electrons, ions, and photons requires the eﬃcient
coupling of the incident (usually 800–1064 nm) laser light
with matter. Clusters turned out to be very eﬃcient ab-
sorbers of laser light since they combine the advantages
of gas and solid targets, namely transparency and high
charge density, while avoiding the drawbacks. The latter
are the low abundances in gas targets and reﬂection of
the laser beam at the target surface as well as the escape
of energetic particles into the cold bulk in the case of
solids. In fact, almost 100% absorption of the laser light
was observed in experiments with rare gas clusters [1].

The interaction scenario on which most researchers in
the ﬁeld agree upon is as follows: after removal of the
ﬁrst electrons from their “parent” ions (inner ionization)
and the cluster as a whole (outer ionization) the cluster
charges up. The total electric ﬁeld (i.e., laser plus space
charge ﬁeld) inside the cluster leads to inner ionization
up to high charge states not possible with the laser ﬁeld
alone (ionization ignition [2, 3]). However, the restor-
ing force of the ions counteracts outer ionization so that
ionization ignition stops at some point. Moreover, the
cluster expands due to Coulomb explosion and thermal
pressure, thus lowering the electric ﬁeld due to the ions.
The latter determines the dominant eigenfrequency of the
cluster, i.e., the Mie frequency

with ρ the charge density, Ni the number of ions of
(mean) charge state Z, and R the cluster radius (atomic
units are used unless noted otherwise). For laser wave-
lengths
500 nm, soon after the removal of the ﬁrst elec-
trons ωMie exceeds ωl. Hence linear resonance

≥

ωMie(t) = ωl

(2)

occurs not before the cluster has suﬃciently expanded
(typically after a few hundred femtoseconds). At linear
resonance the electric ﬁeld inside the cluster is enhanced

instead of shielded [4] so that even higher charge states
can be created and even more energy can be absorbed
from the laser.

Absorption of laser energy is only possible through res-
onances (linear or nonlinear) or non-adiabaticities (col-
lisions). Commonly used phrases to explain absorption
like “laser dephasing heating” or “collisions with the clus-
ter boundary” are correct but meaningless since dephas-
ing is, according to Poynting’s theorem, a prerequisite for
absorption while the electron collisions with the cluster
boundary have to occur at the right frequency in order
to yield eﬃcient absorption.

The importance of the linear resonance has been
demonstrated both in pump probe experiments and sim-
ulations [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The emission of
third and higher harmonics of the incident laser light
has been observed in computer simulations [13]. Colli-
sional ionization and absorption are of minor importance
at wavelengths
800 nm or greater [14, 15, 16] whereas
it is the dominant absorption mechanism at short wave-
lengths [16, 17] not studied in the present Letter.

≈

One of the crucial points in the above mentioned sce-
nario is the mechanism of outer ionization, which goes
hand in hand with absorption [18] since the laser en-
ergy is transiently stored in the freed, energetic electrons.
These electrons leave net positive charge behind, which
ﬁnally Coulomb explodes. The latter converts electron
energy into ion energy, which explains why experimental-
ists typically measure MeV ions but only keV electrons
[19, 20, 21]. In order to separate outer ionization and ab-
sorption due to the linear resonance (2) from other mech-
anisms we consider only the ﬁrst few tens of femtoseconds
of the laser-cluster interaction where ion motion is neg-
ligible and linear resonance is therefore ruled out. Pre-
vious work pointed out already the possible importance
of nonlinear resonance [22, 23] or, equivalently, Landau
damping in ﬁnite systems [24]. So far these mechanisms
were clearly observed only in simpliﬁed model systems.
The interpretation of results from molecular dynamics
or particle-in-cell simulations, on the other hand, is of-

ten hampered by the complex dynamics of the individual
particles that makes the clear distinction of absorption
mechanisms diﬃcult. In this Letter we bridge this gap by
analyzing our particle-in-cell results in terms of nonlinear
oscillators. This enables us to prove that essentially all
electrons contributing to outer ionization pass through
the nonlinear resonance, so that the latter is unequivo-
cally identiﬁed as the collisionless absorption mechanism
if linear resonance is impossible.

In general, the eigenfrequency of a particle in a given
potential depends on the excursion amplitude (or the en-
ergy) of the particle, ω = ω[ˆr]. In a (laser-) driven system
the excursion amplitude is time-dependent so that it may
dynamically pass through the resonance

ω[ˆr(t)] = ωl,

(3)

where ωl is the driver frequency. Equation (3) deﬁnes
nonlinear resonance (NLR). Refs.
[23, 25] discuss at
length the signiﬁcant features of laser-driven systems un-
dergoing NLR. Here we restrict ourselves to the prerequi-
sites necessary to understand the analysis of our particle-
in-cell results below.

In the rigid sphere-model (RSM) (see, e.g., [23, 26, 27])
of a cluster both electrons and ions are modelled by ho-
mogeneously charged spheres which, in a linearly polar-
ized laser ﬁeld, oscillate along z around their common
center of mass, which is in good approximation the cen-
ter of the ion sphere. In the case of equal charge density
and radii R, the equation of motion for the center of the
electron sphere can be written in dimensionless entities
as

less parameter in the RSM is the ratio of Mie frequency
to laser frequency. As was observed in Ref. [23] the ab-
sorption of laser energy in the RSM is characterized by a
threshold driver strength below which absorption is neg-
ligible (harmonic regime) and above which absorption is
almost constant. Figure 1 shows this threshold behav-
ior for ωMie/ωl = 2.7 and a n = 10-cycle sin2-pulse

employing perturbation theory (as long as ωMie is only
a few times the laser frequency) or by approximating it
with the over-barrier ﬁeld strength for the cluster poten-
tial at larger ratios ωMie/ωl [28]. Here we restrict our-
selves to the method for the identiﬁcation of NLR, which
will be used for the more realistic particle-in-cell results

ωeﬀ(τ )/ωl, which passes through unity at the NLR (3).
Figure 2 shows a typical example for the temporal behav-
ior of (ωeﬀ(τ )/ωl)2 above the threshold driver strength in
Fig. 1. Since (ωMie/ωl)2 = 7.29, (ωeﬀ(τ )/ωl)2 starts at
this value (dashed line in Fig. 2) and drops with increas-
ing driver strength. It passes through unity at the time
indicated by the vertical line, and it is exactly at that
time where the electron sphere is set free, as it is clearly
visible from the energy of the electron sphere, which
passes through zero, and the excursion. We have checked
that outer ionization and occurrence of NLR holds for all
driver strengths above the threshold whereas the reso-
nance is never met below threshold.

Let us now turn to the particle-in-cell (PIC) [29] re-
sults. We consider pre-ionized clusters of ﬁxed radius
R = 3.2 nm but of various charge densities (i.e., diﬀerent
degree of inner ionization). The ratio of charge density
to critical density ρ/ρc = ω2
p/ω2
l varies from
20 to 100. The clusters are exposed to 8-cycle sin2-pulses
of wavelength λ = 1056 nm. Since ion motion does not
play an important role during the simulation time the
ions are ﬁxed, which ensures a well deﬁned, constant
Mie frequency ωMie. Figure 3 shows the absorbed en-
ergy per electron in units of the ponderomotive potential

sphere in the RSM above. A PIC particle has the same
charge to mass ratio as a “real” electron, that is, e/m =
1 in atomic units. Each PIC particle moves under the
−
inﬂuence of the external laser ﬁeld and the space charge
ﬁeld Esc =
∇Φ(r, t) due to the potential Φ(r, t) that
is created by all charges (mapped to a numerical grid).
Hence the equation of motion of the ith PIC particle is

(8)
Clearly, Esc(ri, t) depends on the position of all other
particles
= i as well. The PIC simulation starts with
the neutral cluster conﬁguration where the electrons sit
on top of the ions so that Esc(ri, 0)
0. Hence, a PIC
electron “sees” initially an eﬀective frequency ωeﬀ,i(0) =
0. The laser ﬁeld disturbs the charge equilibrium and
ω2
eﬀ,i(t) becomes diﬀerent from zero. ω2
eﬀ,i(t) may be even
negative in regions of accumulated electron density (re-
pulsive potential). As the cluster charges up, (ωeﬀ/ωl)2
quickly increases beyond unity (where the RSM starts in
the ﬁrst place). The starting from ωeﬀ,i(0) = 0, the pos-
sibility of negative ω2
eﬀ,i(t), and the three-dimensionality
are the main diﬀerences to the RSM analysis above.

By following the dynamics of the electrons in the ef-
fective frequency vs. energy-plane one can identify the
main pathway to outer ionization and eﬃcient absorp-
tion. In Fig. 4a–d the scaled eﬀective frequencies squared
(ωeﬀ/ωl)2 of the individual PIC electrons are plotted vs.
their energies Etot(t) = ˙r2
Φ(ri, t) they would have
i (t)/2
if the driver is switched oﬀ instantaneously at t = 2.5,
3, 3.5, and 4 laser cycles, respectively. We deﬁne the
time when, for a particular electron, Etot becomes > 0
as the ionization time of that electron. The laser in-
1016 Wcm−2, and the preionized cluster
tensity is 2.5
is 40 times overcritical so that (ωMie/ωl)2 = 40/3. As
is clearly visible in Fig. 4, each electron reaches posi-
tive energy close to the point (ω2
l , Etot/Up) = (1, 0).
The radial position of each electron is color coded, indi-
cating that outer ionization occurs at radii around 2R.
Data points at radii > 3R (orange and yellow colors in
Fig. 4a,b) with positive but very small Etot and ω2
0
represent low energetic electrons removed earlier during
the pulse. Electrons with positive energy but small radii
[visible in (a) and (b)] are those driven back to the clus-
ter by the laser ﬁeld. For the electrons inside the cluster
potential (negative energies and radii < R, color coded
blue and black in Fig. 4) (ωeﬀ /ωl)2 spreads over a wide
range, starting from the maximum value (ωMie/ωl)2 down
to negative values due to the repulsive force exerted by
the compressed electron cloud. Note that negative values
occur mainly at early times where most of the electrons

However, the absorbed energy is nonlinear in Up and dis-
plays a maximum around an intensity Ith before it drops
because of depletion of electrons. The threshold intensity
Ith for the case ρ/ρc = 40, as it is predicted by the RSM,
is indicated in Fig. 3. It agrees very well with the max-
imum in the corresponding PIC absorption curve. With
increasing charge density the maxima of the absorbed

sities while the absorbed energy per electron decreases.

is too short for the linear resonance to occur (or dur-
ing the early cluster dynamics in longer pulses) and if
electron-ion collisions (inverse bremsstrahlung) are neg-
ligible, as it is the case at near infrared or greater wave-
lengths.
In order to prove the occurrence of nonlinear
resonance we introduced a method to analyze the re-
sults obtained from particle-in-cell simulations, namely
the mapping of the system of electrons and ions that
interact through their mean ﬁeld onto a system of non-
linear oscillators whose time-dependent frequencies un-
equivocally revealed the coincidence of electron removal
and nonlinear resonance.

are still inside the cluster. The occurrence of NLR is
less clear for the few electrons leaving the cluster even
earlier than t = 2.5 laser cycles. As mentioned above,
these electrons move in a shallow eﬀective potential with
(ωeﬀ /ωl)2 < 1 when they leave the cluster with ease and
with rather low kinetic energy because the laser intensity
is still low at the time of their emission.

eﬀ /ω2

One may object that, since the denominator in (8)
necessarily increases while the nominator decreases for
an electron on its way out of the cluster potential, the
passage through a point (ω2
l , Etot/Up) = (x, 0) with
x some value < (ωMie/ωl)2 is rather the consequence of
outer ionization than the mechanism behind it. How-
ever, NLR only occurs at x = 1, and the results in Fig. 4
show only little spreading along (ωeﬀ /ωl)2 at Etot = 0.
Moreover, the fact that both the single electron ener-
gies become positive and the radii exceed
2R when
(ωeﬀ /ωl)2 = 1 indicates that NLR is indeed the responsi-
ble mechanism behind outer ionization accompanied by
eﬃcient absorption of laser energy.

≈

In summary, we have shown that cluster electrons con-
tributing to eﬃcient absorption and outer ionization in
near infrared laser ﬁelds undergo nonlinear resonance,
meaning that the instantaneous frequency of their mo-
tion in a time-dependent, anharmonic, eﬀective poten-
tial meets the laser frequency. Nonlinear resonance is
the only possible absorption mechanism if the laser pulse

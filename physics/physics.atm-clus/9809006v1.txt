molecules

Abstract

The rovibrational kinetic energy for an arbitrary number of rigid molecules is com-
puted. The result has the same general form as the kinetic energy in the molecular
rovibrational Hamiltonian, although certain quantities are augmented to account for
the rotational energy of the monomers. No speciﬁc choices of internal coordinates or
body frame are made in order to accommodate the large variety of such conventions.
However, special attention is paid to how key quantities transform when these conven-
tions are changed. An example system is explicitly analysed as an illustration of the
formalism.

1 Introduction

The rovibrational kinetic energy of a molecular (rigid body) complex has previously been
computed explicitly for a number of speciﬁc cases. Examples include calculations for the
atom-monomer system, consisting of a point particle and a rigid body, by Brocks and van
Koeven[1], van der Avoird [2], and Makarewicz and Bauder [3]; the molecular dimer, con-
sisting of two rigid bodies, by Brocks et al. [4] and van der Avoird [5]; the molecular trimer
by Xantheas and Sutcliﬀe[6] and van der Avoird, Olthof, and Wormer [7]; as well as closely
related systems of single molecules with internal rotation [8, 9]. In the present article we
derive the rovibrational kinetic energy of an arbitrary molecular complex containing an ar-
bitrary number of rigid bodies. That is, we express the kinetic energy in terms of the total
angular momentum of the complex and the momenta associated with the internal degrees
of freedom. The term “rovibrational” is perhaps misleading since it implies small amplitude
vibrations of the complex, an assumption we do not make. A rovibrational kinetic energy
for a general molecular complex has been proposed earlier by Makarewicz and Bauder [3];
their analysis diﬀers markedly from ours in that they do not impose rigidity conditions on
the monomers nor do they distinguish the relative rotational motion of the monomers from
the internal vibrations of the monomers.

One method for deriving the rovibrational kinetic energy of a system of rigid bodies
would be to begin with the rovibrational kinetic energy of a system of point particles and

1

then impose rigidity constraints within certain subsets of these particles. A general analysis
of internal constraints on n body systems has been given by Menou and Chapuisat [10] and
by Gatti et al. [11]. These authors observe that such a formalism may be applied to ﬁnd
the rovibrational kinetic energy of a rigid body complex, though they do not derive such a
kinetic energy. The constrained systems approach has the advantage of naturally allowing
the relaxation of the rigidity constraints to include small internal vibrations of the monomers.
However, within a strictly rigid body, the positions, masses, and velocities of the constituent
particles are irrelevant. Rather, only the overall orientation, moment of inertia, and angular
velocity are of interest. Therefore, in our derivation of the rovibrational kinetic energy,
we assume from the outset that the bodies are rigid and use a kinetic energy consisting of
only the translational and rotational energies of the rigid bodies. It should be mentioned
that whichever approach is followed, there exists an ambiguous extrapotential term in the
quantum kinetic energy. The origin of this ambiguity rests in the lack of knowledge about the
potential which conﬁnes the system to the manifold of rigid shapes. See for example Kaplan,
Maitra, and Heller [12]. For simplicity, we neglect any extrapotential terms arising from the
constraint process and adopt the standard form (translational plus rotational energies) for
the quantum kinetic energy of a rigid body.

Our approach is modeled on the derivation of Ref. [13], valid for clusters of point particles,
but is augmented to include the rotational kinetic energy of the monomers; the current paper
therefore generalises many results valid for point particles to systems of extended rigid bodies.
Also, in deriving the rovibrational kinetic energy, we make no speciﬁc choice of internal
coordinates or body frame. This allows our results to be applicable to the wide range of
coordinate and frame conventions suitable to diﬀerent molecular complexes. We discuss how
the various quantities appearing in the kinetic energy transform under changes of internal
coordinates and body frame. We also present two distinct decompositions of the kinetic
energy into rotational and vibrational (internal) contributions. The ﬁrst decomposition
is independent of the conventions for internal coordinates and body frame. The second
decomposition has a form more common to rovibrational Hamiltonians in the literature,
though it is not independent of coordinate and frame conventions.

The current paper has been inﬂuenced by recent work exhibiting the importance of
gauge theory and geometric phase in the study of rovibrational coupling [13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19]. In addition to rovibrational coupling, the geometric, or Berry’s, phase [20] has
important applications in Born-Oppenheimer theory[21], optics[22, 23], and guiding centre
motion[24], to name but a few examples. The inﬂuence of gauge theory on our analysis
here is most readily evident in the form of the kinetic energy Eq. (27), which owing to the
appearance of a gauge potential is reminiscent of the kinetic energy of a charged particle in a
magnetic ﬁeld. Notions of gauge invariance and covariance have also inﬂuenced our analysis
of transformation properties presented in Sect. 2.3. Although our development is inﬂuenced
by the techniques and concepts of gauge theory and geometric phase, this paper requires no
speciﬁc background in either ﬁeld.

The article is structured as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the classical kinetic energy.
The principal computation of the article, culminating in the rovibrational kinetic energy
Eq. (27), is contained in Sect. 2.1. In Sect. 2.2 we show how the rovibrational kinetic energy
of Eq. (27) can be placed in a diﬀerent form, that of Eq. (33), which is more common in
the rovibrational literature. Sect. 2.3 is a systematic discussion of how important quantities

2

transform under changes in the internal coordinates and body frame. Sect. 3 is an aside in
which we discuss the form of quantum kinetic energy operators in general. In particular,
Sect. 3.1 discusses an alternative to the usual Podolsky form of the quantum kinetic energy,
and Sect. 3.2 illustrates how scaling the wave function introduces an extrapotential term into
the kinetic energy. In Sect. 4 we apply the results of Sect. 3 to compute the quantum kinetic
energy of a molecular complex. We work through a concrete example in Sect. 5 applying our
formalism to the system of a single monomer and an atom. Sect. 6 contains conclusions.

2 The classical kinetic energy of a molecular complex

2.1 The principal derivation

In this paper, a molecular complex is modeled by a collection of n rigid bodies or monomers.
No constraints are placed on the positions or orientations of the monomers or on the sym-
metry of the moment of inertia tensors. In particular, we allow the monomers to be point
particles (atoms), collinear bodies, or noncollinear bodies. However, for mathematical sim-
plicity, we initially assume that each monomer is noncollinear. Then, after deriving the
rovibrational kinetic energy, we comment on the straightforward generalisation of allowing
complexes containing collinear monomers and point particles.

We begin by introducing three classes of frames which are important in our derivation.
The space frame (SF) is the inertial, laboratory-ﬁxed frame. There are n individual body
frames (IBF), one for each body; IBF α, α = 1, . . . , n, is ﬁxed to rigid body α and rotates
with the body. Finally, there is a single collective body frame (CBF), which is ﬁxed to the
complex as a whole. The CBF diﬀers from the other frames in that it must be speciﬁed for
each shape or internal conﬁguration of the complex. In general, this speciﬁcation produces
singularities in the CBF, a fact which has been studied in three- and four-atom systems
[25, 26]. There is no canonical way of choosing the CBF, though there are several methods
commonly used in such Hamiltonians, such as ﬁxing the CBF to the principal axes of the
complex or to one of the IBFs. In this paper we will make no speciﬁc choice of CBF.

We employ the following notation to denote the frame to which the components of a vector
are referred. For an arbitrary vector v, an s superscript, that is vs, indicates components in
the SF; an iα superscript indicates components in the IBF of body α; and a c superscript
indicates components in the CBF. (For notational simplicity, at a certain point we will drop
the c superscript, leaving it understood thereafter that a vector without a superscript is
implicitly in the CBF.) The components of v in the various frames are related by proper
orthogonal 3

3 matrices, which we deﬁne by

The matrix Ss
α determines the orientation of body α, that is, the IBF of body α, in the SF;
the matrix R determines the orientation of the entire complex in the SF; and the matrix Sc

The conﬁguration of the complex of n rigid bodies is fully speciﬁed by the centre of mass
position of each body and the orientation of each body. To eliminate the overall translational
degrees of freedom, we ﬁx the centre of mass of the entire complex at the origin. The centre

We assume that the masses of the n bodies have been absorbed into our deﬁnition of the

contribution, is

The above equation expresses the angular velocity of the IBF of body α with respect to the

velocity of the IBF of body α with respect to the CBF. However, this decomposition has no
inherent physical meaning since it depends on the convention used to deﬁne the CBF. By
appropriately changing this convention, either of these two terms could be made to vanish.

Equation (27) decomposes the kinetic energy into two terms. The ﬁrst term is the kinetic
energy the complex would have if it were a rigid body of ﬁxed shape. We regard this term
as the rotational kinetic energy of the complex. The second term we regard as the internal,
or vibrational, kinetic energy. Often in such rotation-vibration decompositions, a diﬀerent
rotational term appears which contains a modiﬁed moment of inertia tensor and a modiﬁed
angular momentum vector. We will relate the above decomposition to such alternative
decompositions in the next section. For now, however, notice that the appearance of Aµ in
the internal kinetic energy couples the internal degrees of freedom to the angular momentum.
For this reason, we call Aµ the Coriolis potential. Furthermore, we call gµν the internal metric
J. Note that the internal kinetic energy has the same

The kinetic energy given in Ref. [13] for a collection of point particles has exactly the
same form as Eq. (27). However, for collections of point particles, the quantities deﬁned in
Eqs. (19) – (21) do not contain the terms with Miα
α . The appearance of these terms and,
of course, the introduction of an extra 3n internal coordinates are the sole modiﬁcations
necessary to augment the kinetic energy of a system of point particles to include the rotational
kinetic energy of the monomers. The fundamental reason why the form of the kinetic energy
is the same for these two cases is the rotational symmetry of the kinetic energy operator;
Eq. (27) is in fact a general result, valid for any SO(3) invariant metric. We will discuss this
matter further in a future publication.

We comment now on how the preceding results are generalised to include collinear
monomers and point particles. First, the number of coordinates changes. A noncollinear
body requires three Euler angles to fully specify its orientation, whereas a collinear body
requires only two spherical coordinates to specify its orientation (the direction of its collinear
axis). A point particle, of course, requires no orientational coordinates. Therefore, instead
of 6n
3 coordinates parametrising the
centre of mass system. Here, n = nn + nc + np is the total number of monomers, where nn
is the number of noncollinear monomers, nc is the number of collinear monomers, and np is
the number of point particles.

3 coordinates as before, there are 3n + 3nn + 2nc −

We next describe the form of the rovibrational kinetic energy when incorporating collinear
bodies and point particles. First, the computation leading from Eq. (6) to Eq. (27) is
essentially unchanged by the inclusion of collinear bodies and point particles, so long as
one takes the moment of inertia tensor Mα of a point particle to be 0. The moment of
inertia tensor of a collinear body is explicitly Mα = κα(I
α), where nα is a unit
vector pointing along the collinear axis and κα is the single nonzero principal moment. The
quantity nα is a more natural measure of the orientation of a collinear body than Sα, since
Sα overparametrises the orientations. We therefore rewrite Eqs. (19) – (21) in the following
form, more appropriate for a general complex,

where we have ordered the monomers with the noncollinear bodies ﬁrst, the collinear bodies
second, and the point particles last. We omit the straightforward proof of these equations
relying instead on the following two observations. First, the orientational contribution from
the point particles has dropped out since Mα is 0 for such particles. Next, the orientational
contribution from a collinear body is identical to the contribution of a single Jacobi vector.
This fact is easily understood by modeling a collinear body as two point particles connected
by a Jacobi vector. The above equations may be combined with Eqs. (23) and (24) to
obtain the kinetic energy Eq. (27) of a general molecular complex. The only note of caution
occurs if the entire complex should become collinear, in which case M is not invertible and
singularities may arise.

2.2 An alternative form of the kinetic energy

We rearrange the kinetic energy Eq. (27) to place it in a form which is more common in the
literature on rovibrational Hamiltonians. We deﬁne the modiﬁed moment of inertia tensor
˜M by

−
where hµν is the inverse matrix of hµν, and the vector K, often called the angular momentum
of vibration, by

K = hµνaµpν.

The above equation may be veriﬁed by comparing the terms of order J 2, J 1, and J 0 in
Eqs. (33) and (27). The equality of the respective terms is readily apparent from the following
identities

gµνM−1aν = hµν ˜M−1aν,

˜M−1aτ )hτ ν,
gµν = hµν + hµσ(aσ ·
˜M−1 = M−1 + gµνAµAT

which follow from Eqs. (31) and (24).

Equation (33) provides an alternative rovibrational decomposition of the kinetic energy,
in a form common in the literature for rovibrational Hamiltonians. For example, the Wilson-
Howard-Watson molecular Hamiltonian[28, 29] is expressed in this manner using the Eckart
conventions, for which various simpliﬁcations occur.

precise set of rules. Although the analysis of these rules is not critical to the logical ﬂow of
this paper, we include an account of them for the following two reasons. An understanding
of transformation rules facilitates conversion between diﬀerent sets of conventions. This is
important in actual problems, where it is not uncommon to utilise more than one coordinate
or frame convention, especially for large amplitude motions. Also, knowledge of transfor-
mation properties leads to the deﬁnition and consideration of quantities which transform
in a simple manner (that is invariantly or covariantly). Such quantities often have special
geometric or physical signiﬁcance. The review of Littlejohn and Reinsch [13] contains an
in depth discussion of transformation properties specialised for systems of point particles.
Since these results are essentially unchanged by the generalisation to include rigid bodies,
we simply summarise here the key results from Ref. [13] and comment on how they are to
be extended.

We ﬁrst introduce the important concept of q-tensors. We consider a new set of coordi-
nates q′µ which are functions of the old coordinates qµ. A q-tensor transforms under such a
change in coordinates by contracting each lower Greek index µ with ∂qµ/∂q′ν and each upper
Greek index µ with ∂q′ν/∂qµ. The rank of the tensor is the total number of such indices,
whether upper or lower. For example, τ αµ is a rank one q-tensor because it transforms via

τ ′

αµ =

αµ is computed from Eq. (15) using the new coordinates q′µ and τ αµ is computed
where τ ′

zero q-tensors, also called q-scalars, are invariant under coordinate transformations. They

gµν, and gµν.

R-tensors, also called R-scalars, do not depend on the choice of CBF and include T and ˙qµ.
Rank two R-tensors include M and Mα.

The quantity Aµ is not an R-tensor. Instead, it has a more complicated transformation

property

formation law of a non-Abelian gauge potential is given in Ref. [13]. We simply note that
such an analysis motivates the introduction of the Coriolis ﬁeld strength,

The Coriolis ﬁeld strength is a rank two q-tensor and a rank one R-tensor. We will only use
the Coriolis ﬁeld strength brieﬂy in Sect. 5. However, it plays a central role in the gauge
theoretic approach to rovibrational coupling.

(42)

One should be aware that other quantities which have been introduced are also not R-
tensors. These include hµν and ˜M. However, it should be noted that both of these quantities
have counterparts, gµν and M respectively, which are R-tensors. For further insight into the
relationship between these two pairs of quantities, see Ref. [13]. Various other quantities
which are not R-tensors include τ αµ, aµ, K, ω, and pµ.

An important observation is that the two decompositions of the kinetic energy, Eqs. (27)
and (33), diﬀer in their transformation properties. Speciﬁcally, Eq. (27) decomposes the
kinetic energy into two terms which are q- and R-scalars. Equation (33), on the other hand,
decomposes the kinetic energy into two terms which are q-scalars but not R-scalars. Thus,
the latter decomposition is dependent on the choice of CBF, whereas the former is not. For
this reason, we view Eq. (27) as the fundamental rovibrational decomposition of the kinetic
energy. However, depending on the CBF convention, the decomposition of Eq. (33) may
very well be easier to compute. (See Sect. 5.) We refer to Ref. [13] for further discussion of
these decompositions.

3 General expressions for the quantum kinetic energy

3.1 The unscaled kinetic energy

We temporarily abandon the speciﬁc system of a molecular complex in order to present
expressions for the quantum kinetic energy of a general system. The results of this section
are largely similar to previous work of Nauts and Chapuisat[30], which in turn relies on
several earlier references. We also note that Van der Avoird et al. have employed a similar
formalism for the water trimer [7]. Here we will summarise relevant aspects of these results
to ﬁx notation and to lay the foundation for Sect. 4. Also, we apply the formalism to the
simple example of a single rigid body, which will be of future use. In Sect. 3.2 we present a
new approach to scaling the wave function.

We denote the classical kinetic energy by

10

where x stands for a collection of generalised position variables xa, a = 1, . . . , d (d is the
number of degrees of freedom), πa, a = 1, . . . , d, are generalised momenta, and Gab are the
components of the inverse metric tensor G−1. When repeated, the indices a, b, c, . . . are
assumed to be summed from 1 to d, both in Eq. (43) and the subsequent development. The
momenta πa are linear combinations of the canonical momenta,

T =

πaGab(x)πb,

1
2

πa = C b

a (x)pb,

where pa is the momentum canonically conjugate to xa and the C b
a are components of the
change of basis matrix. Nauts and Chapuisat [30] call the more general momenta πa quasi-
momenta and reserve the term momenta for what we call the canonical momenta pa. The
kinetic energy Eq. (43) is expressed in terms of the canonical momenta pa by

T =

where ˜Gab are the components of the inverse metric ˜G−1 = CT G−1C with respect to the

or more generally,

where ˆπa is the operator corresponding to the classical momentum πa,

As observed by van der Avoird et al.
[7], even though the adjoint form of the kinetic
energy represents the same diﬀerential operator as the Podolsky form, Eqs. (48) and (49)
are convenient for evaluating matrix elements since the adjoint of the momentum operator
eﬀectively acts on the bra to the left.

An important illustration of the preceding formalism and one which we shall need later
is that of a single rigid body. We deﬁne Euler angles [x1, x2, x3] = [α, β, γ] in the usual
way by R(α, β, γ) = Rz(α)Ry(β)Rz(γ), where R rotates the space frame into the body
frame and Ri
is a rotation about the ith space axis. The body referred angular mo-

Often it is useful to multiply the original wave function Φ by some real positive function

Such a scaling produces a new kinetic energy operator acting on the new wave function Ψ.
In this section, we derive the form of this new kinetic energy operator. Similar discussions
are given by Nauts and Chapuisat [30] and Chapuisat, Belafhal, and Nauts [33]. The most
notable distinction between our approach and these earlier accounts is our introduction of a
new adjoint, shown in Eq. (64). This adjoint allows for a diﬀerent form for the scaled kinetic
energy operator shown in Eq. (67) and the associated extrapotential term in Eq. (68).

We note that Eq. (61) induces a new inner product on the scaled wave functions. We

denote this new inner product with an

Comparing Eq. (67) to the unscaled expression Eq. (49), we note that the two operators diﬀer
by the additional scalar term in Eq. (67) and the diﬀerent adjoints which are used. Thus,
scaling the wave function may be used to place the adjoint of the momenta in an alternative,
perhaps more attractive, form, but only at the expense of introducing an extrapotential term
into the kinetic energy.

4 The quantum kinetic energy of a molecular complex

We quantise the classical kinetic energy Eq. (27) using Eq. (49) derived in the previous
section. This approach requires the operators ˆpµ, ˆJi, and their adjoints. Since the classical
momentum pµ is canonically conjugate to qµ, the quantised operator ˆpµ has the usual form
of Eq. (47)

i
−
The quantised angular momenta ˆJi satisfy the standard “anomalous” commutation relations
[ ˆJi, ˆJj] =
k ǫijk ˆJk and of course commute with all rotationally invariant operators, for
example,

ˆpµ =

(70)

To compute the volume element of Eq. (53), we require explicit coordinates covering all di-
rections of conﬁguration space. This means deﬁning three Euler angles [θ1, θ2, θ3] = [α, β, γ],
describing the collective orientation R, which complement the d
3 internal coordinates qµ.

the Euler angle conventions used in Section 3. The noncanonical momenta ˆπi = ˆJi and

5 Example: a monomer-atom complex

We compute the rovibrational kinetic energy explicitly for a system containing a single
noncollinear rigid monomer with moment of inertia M1 and a single atom, for example,
Ar-NH3. The kinetic energy of such systems has already been studied by Brocks and van
Koeven[1], van der Avoird [2], and Makarewicz and Bauder [3]. Our presentation is mainly
designed to illustrate the formalism of the preceding sections, although we believe that the
derivation of the Coriolis potential Ai
µν, and internal metric gµν
is new.

µ, Coriolis ﬁeld strength Bi

We deﬁne the CBF by ﬁxing it to the rigid monomer. This implies that the matrix S,
deﬁning the orientation of the monomer’s IBF in the CBF, is constant. We take this constant
to be the identity,

16

Since there is only one rigid body and one Jacobi vector, we drop all “α” subscripts, except
on M1, where the “1” serves to distinguish the moment of inertia of the monomer from the
total moment of inertia M of the complex. The Jacobi vector r locates the atom with respect
to the monomer and its components may therefore be chosen as the internal coordinates,
that is

Thus,

[q1, q2, q3] = [r1, r2, r3].

Furthermore, from Eqs. (15) and (85), we have

S(q) = I.

ri,µ = δiµ.

τ µ = 0.

Inserting Eqs. (85), (87), and (88) into Eqs. (28) – (30), we readily obtain

We proceed to ﬁrst construct the kinetic energy Eq. (33) which results here in a simpler

form than Eq. (27). Using Eqs. (31) and (32) we compute

which follows from Eq. (74) and shows that G is constant. Hence, from Eq. (76) it is clear
that ˆpµ is Hermitian with respect to the original inner product. Since ˆK = r
ˆp we ﬁnd
that ˆK is also Hermitian with respect to both the original and the scaled inner products.
Furthermore, the extrapotential term of Eq. (81) arising in the scaled kinetic energy vanishes.

Thus, both the original and the scaled quantum kinetic energies are identical and each is
formed by simply replacing p and J in Eq. (94) with ˆp and ˆJ respectively. Our results agree
with earlier derivations by Brocks and van Koeven [1] and van der Avoird[2].

To simplify the algebra in constructing the kinetic energy Eq. (27), we assume the rigid

has led to several useful applications [15, 16, 19, 35]. We remark that the above asymptotic
form is valid even if the monomer is an asymmetric top.

framework in which explicit Hamiltonians may be readily computed for speciﬁc choices of
coordinates and frames. We have provided a discussion of transformation properties to facil-
itate the changing of these conventions. Our formalism is illustrated with the example of a
monomer-atom system, and more complex systems may be handled with similar ease within
our framework.

One of the more novel and intriguing aspects of our derivation is the appearance of the
Coriolis potential and the various insights which are possible by adopting a gauge theoretical
viewpoint. We brieﬂy cite two areas of current research which are based on this perspective.
First, using gauge theoretic reasoning we have managed to generalise the Eckart conditions,
so often employed for small vibrations in molecules, to systems of rigid bodies. Much of
the formalism for small vibrational analysis in molecules can then be readily ported over
to study small amplitude vibrations in clusters of rigid molecules. Second, we have been
able to understand rotational splittings in molecules with internal rotors as a sort of Coriolis
Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect. These applications and others will be the subject of future publica-
tions.

A mechanism of disappearance and formation of the Eﬁmov levels of
the helium 4He3 trimer is studied when the force of interatomic interaction is
changed. The resonances including virtual levels are calculated by the method
based on the solving the boundary value problem, at complex energies, for
the Faddeev diﬀerential equations describing the (2 + 1
2 + 1; 1 + 1 + 1)
scattering processes.

I. INTRODUCTION

The system of three 4He atoms is of considerable interest for various ﬁelds of physical
chemistry and molecular physics. The present paper is a sequel of studies of the 4He3
system undertaken in [1], where the repulsive component of the He–He interaction at short
distances between atoms is approximated by a hard core. This allows one to investigate
the 4He3 system within a mathematically rigorous method of solving a three-body problem
in the Boundary-Condition Model developed in [2,3].
In [1], such an approach has been
successfully applied for calculating not only scattering but also the ground- and excited-
state energies of the helium trimer. Investigation made in [1] has shown that the method
proposed in [2,3] is well suited for performing three–body molecular computations in the
case where repulsive components of interatomic interactions are of a hard core nature.

There is a series of works [4,5,1] showing that the excited state of the 4He trimer is
initiated indeed by the Eﬁmov eﬀect
[6]. In these works the various versions of the Aziz
4He–4He potential were employed However, the basic result of Refs. [4,5,1] on the excited
state of the helium trimer is the same: this state disappears when the interatomic potential
is multiplied by the “ampliﬁcation factor” λ of order 1.2. More precisely, if this potential
is multiplied by the increasing factor λ > 1 then the following eﬀect is observed. First,
t (λ) between the dimer energy ǫd(λ) and the energy of the trimer
the diﬀerence ǫd(λ)
excited state E(1)
t (λ) increases. Then the behavior of this diﬀerence radically changes and
with further increase of λ it monotonously decreases. At λ
disappears.
It is just such a nonstandard behavior of the energy E(1)

atoms becomes more and more strengthening, points to the Eﬁmov nature of the trimer
excited state. And vice versa, when λ slightly decreases (no more than 2 %), the second
excited state E(2)

appears in the trimer [4,5].

t

Here we present the results of our numerical study of a mechanism of disappearance
and formation of the Eﬁmov levels of the helium 4He3 trimer using the method of search
for resonances in a three–body system on the basis of the Faddeev diﬀerential equations.
The idea of the method formulated and proved in [7] consists in calculating the analytic
continuation of the component S0(z) of the scattering matrix corresponding to the (2 + 1
→
2 + 1) process in the physical sheet. For the potentials we use, the three–body resonances
(including virtual levels) lying in the unphysical sheet of energy z plane adjoining the physical
sheet along the interval (ǫd, 0) are the roots of the function S0(z) in the physical sheet. We
have earlier employed this method for computing resonances as roots of S0(z) in the three–
nucleon problem [8].

II. METHOD

In this work we consider the three-atomic 4He system with the total angular momentum
L = 0. The angular partial analysis reduces the initial Faddeev equation for three identical
bosons to a system of coupled two-dimensional integro-diﬀerential equations (see Ref. [1]
and references therein)

Our goal is to study the analytic continuation of the function S0(z) into the physical sheet.
As it follows from the results of Refs. [7], the S0(z) is just that truncation of the total
scattering matrix whose roots in the physical sheet correspond to location of resonances in
the unphysical sheet adjoining the physical one along the spectral interval (ǫd, 0).

III. RESULTS OF COMPUTATIONS

In the present work we make use of the Faddeev equations (1) considered together with
the boundary conditions (2), (3) to calculate the values of the 4He3 scattering matrix S0(z)
in the physical sheet. We search for the resonances including the virtual levels as roots of
S0(z) and for the bound-state energies as positions of poles of S0(z). All the results presented
below are obtained for the case lmax = 0.

In all our calculations, ¯h2/m = 12.12 K ˚A2. As the interatomic He – He - interaction we
employed the widely used semiempirical potential HFD-B [12]. The value of the core range c
is chosen to be equal 1.3 ˚A providing at least six reliable ﬁgures of the dimer binding energy
ǫd and three ﬁgures of the trimer ground state energy E(0)
. A detailed description of the
numerical method we use is presented in Ref. [1]. In contrast to [1], in the present work we
solve the block-three-diagonal algebraic system on the basis of the matrix sweep method.
This allows us to dispense with writing the system matrix on the hard drive and to carry out
all the operations related to its inversion immediately in RAM. Besides, the matrix sweep
method reduces almost by one order the computer time required for computations on the
grids of the same dimensions as in [1].

We searched for the resonances (roots of the function S0(z) on the physical sheet) and

bound-state energies (roots of the function S−
ing the complex version of the secant method. We found positions of the four ”resonances”,
the roots of S0(z), in case of the grid parameters Nθ = Nρ = 600 and ρmax = 600 ˚A. Complex
roots of the function S0(z) are located at points (
0.59 + i 2.67) mK,
(2.51 + i 4.34) mK and (6.92 + i 6.10) mK. These ”resonances” are situated beyond the do-
main of scattering matrix holomorphy Π(S) where the applicability of our method is proved
[11]. So we do not consider the roots of function S0(z) as genuine resonances for the 4He3
system. However it is remarkable that the “true” (i. e., getting inside Π(S)) virtual levels and
then the energies of the excited (Eﬁmov) states appear just due to these (quasi)resonances
when the potential V (x) is weakened.

in the 4He trimer, we have ﬁrst calculated the scattering matrix S0(z) for λ < 1. We have
found that for a value of λ slightly smaller than 0.9885, the (quasi)resonance closest to the
real axis gets on it and transforms into a virtual level of the second order. This virtual level

S0(z), also the conjugate root of this function gets on the real axis. With a subsequent
decrease of λ the virtual level of the second order splits into a pair of the virtual levels of
the ﬁrst order which move in opposite directions. One of the virtual level moves towards
the threshold ǫd and “collides” with it at λ < 0.98. For λ = 0.975 the function S0(z) instead
of the root acquires a new pole corresponding to the second excited state of the trimer with
the energy E(2)

To determine the mechanism of disappearance of the excited state of the helium trimer
we have calculated the scattering matrix S0(z) when the two-body interactions become
stronger owing to the increasing coupling constant λ > 1. We found that this disappearance
proceeds just according to the scheme of the formation of new excited states; only the order
of occurring events is inverse. In the interval between λ = 1.17 and λ = 1.18 there occurs
a “jump” of the level E(1)
on the unphysical sheet and it transforms from the pole of the
function S0(z) into its root corresponding to the trimer virtual level.

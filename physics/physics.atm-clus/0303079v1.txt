Abstract

The disassembly of molecular clusters (N2)n (n=50-3000) in strong optical
ﬁelds is investigated using two-dimensional time-of-ﬂight spectrometry. Very
highly charged ions are formed with a two-component energy distribution. A
low-energy, isotropic component correlates with Coulomb explosion. A high-
energy, anisotropic component, that results from a “charge ﬂipping” acceler-
ation mechanism, gives rise to ions with energies in excess of the Coulombic
limit.

The physics that governs the disassembly of atomic clusters in intense optical ﬁelds has
attracted considerable attention in the course of the last decade (for a recent review, see
In the optical regime, light intensities larger than ∼1012 W
[1] and references therein).
cm−2 are termed “intense”; ﬁelds generated in such light are strong enough to cause non-
perturbative eﬀects in most atoms and molecules. At light intensities above 1014 W cm−2,
multiphoton and/or tunneling eﬀects force nearly every irradiated atom and molecule to
undergo ionization. Much eﬀort has been devoted in recent years to studies of small atomic
and molecular systems under the inﬂuence of such ﬁelds. Among the dominant eﬀects ob-
served are above-threshold ionization (ATI), tunneling ionization, high harmonic generation,
molecular alignment, and enhanced ionization of molecules. For a recent update on progress
in these areas, see Bandrauk et al. [2]. Experiments that probe such phenomena are typically
conducted under conditions such that the atoms and molecules respond independently to
the laser ﬁeld - the density is kept low enough so that each atom/molecule is “unaware” of
the presence of others in the neighborhood. This is not valid for high-density targets like
solids, where macroscopic ﬁelds that are generated due to charge separation play a crucial
role, and recourse has to be taken to many-body, plasma models in order to gain insight
into the dynamics of laser-solid interactions. Gas-phase clusters act as a bridge between the
low-density and high-density systems. Large atomic clusters, consisting of several hundred
to several hundred thousand atoms per cluster, provide the high density required for sub-
stantial absorption of laser energy. Experimentally, it has been discovered over the last few
years that when such clusters are exposed to an intense ultrashort laser pulse, they absorb
energy very eﬃciently [3]. While energy is absorbed primarily by the electrons in the cluster,
it is rapidly redistributed in the form of incoherent radiation (few keV x-rays) and highly
energetic ions. The level of ionization and the mean energy of the ejected electrons are both
signiﬁcantly higher than expected from the ionization processes known in isolated atoms
and small molecules. The cluster expands and breaks up in a few picoseconds; this rapid
disassembly results in the emission of ions with considerable kinetic energy. While maximum
ion energies as high as an MeV have been reported [4], mean energies are typically in the
range of 10-100 keV. These are several orders of magnitude higher than the energies that
are measured for small molecules.

Although various theoretical models have been proposed to explain the explosion dynam-
ics of clusters under intense ﬁeld irradiation, none can adequately explain the experimentally
observed features that presently drive research in this area. It is clear that most atoms in
a cluster are tunnel ionized at the leading edge of the incident laser pulse. Electrons that
are ejected from individual atoms are accelerated away from the cluster by the ponderomo-
tive potential and what gets left behind is a positively charged core that gives rise to an
increasing potential barrier to further removal of electrons. The question of whether such
a barrier is suﬃcient to retain a large fraction of electrons or not is a major point of con-
tention between the two major models of laser-cluster interaction. In one of the prevailing
scenarios, known in the literature as the hydrodynamic expansion model, it is assumed that
retention of most of the electrons by the cluster results in a spherically symmetric, elec-
trically neutral plasma. The retained electrons absorb energy from the laser by collisional
inverse bremsstrahlung. The hot electron plasma expands due to hydrodynamic pressure,
and transfers energy to the ions. The alternative scenario is referred to as the Coulomb
explosion-ionization ignition model of the dynamics. Here, the electrons that are ejected

2

following tunnel ionization rapidly leave the vicinity of the cluster. As a result, there is
a build-up of charge on the cluster that gives rise to a radial ﬁeld that may become large
enough to drive further ionization at the surface of the sphere. The removal of electrons
at the surface increases the radial ﬁeld further and “ignites” ionization. Cluster explosion
due to the Coulombic repulsion between the positively charged ions then occurs. Neither of
these scenarios account for several facets of the physics of cluster-laser interactions that have
been unveiled in recent experiments. Among them are: (i) Asymmetric Coulomb explosion
of clusters [5]. (ii) Enhancement in the asymmetry of both the ion and electron emission
at the resonance condition, where the plasma frequency matches the driving laser frequency
and the energy absorption by the clusters is most eﬀective [6]. Recent results have provided
the impetus for developing models that extend beyond the prevailing, somewhat simplistic,
picture of isotropic, one-dimensional plasma expansion and of probing the possibility that
new mechanisms for charged particle acceleration, over and above that due to (a) Coulombic
ﬁelds in small and moderately-sized clusters and (b) hydrodynamic pressure in large clusters
might, contribute to the overall dynamics strong optical ﬁelds interact with clusters.

Apart from fundamental interest from the viewpoint of non-perturbative cluster dynam-
ics, insights into new ion acceleration mechanisms are important as they oﬀer tantalizing
scope for applications involving the physics of high energy density matter, and for the devel-
opment of new charged particle acceleration and ion propulsion schemes. Clusters have also
emerged as a promising source of extreme ultraviolet radiation for lithography [7] and for
emission of coherent radiation at large multiples of the incident laser frequency [8]. The inter-
action of pulses from tabletop lasers with D2 and D-rich clusters has already made possible
the study of table-top fusion, which was hitherto restricted to very large national facilities
[9]. The fusion process also holds promise as a source of mono-energetic and short-pulse neu-
trons for medical and material science studies [10]. In order to broaden the scope of studies,
we have applied two-dimensional time-of-ﬂight (TOF) spectrometry to probe the disassem-
bly of relatively small molecular clusters, (N2)n (n=50-3000), in strong optical ﬁelds. These
molecular clusters yield very highly charged atomic ions, including hydrogenic N7+. The
ion energy distribution is found to have two components: a low-energy, isotropic component
that correlates with a Coulomb explosion mechanism, and an anisotropic component that
results from a “charge ﬂipping” ion acceleration mechanism that yields ion energies larger
than those expected from purely Coulombic considerations.

Our experiments were conducted using a supersonic jet expansion source that has been
described in earlier reports [5,6,11]. Brieﬂy, a piezo-driven solenoid valve, with a 30◦ conical
opening of 500 µm, was backed with stagnation pressure of up to 14 bar. The central
part of the cluster beam was sampled by a 500 µm skimmer placed ∼30 cm downstream,
in an interaction chamber maintained at 10−7 Torr. A Ti:sapphire laser was used that
produces 100 fs long pulses, at a repetition rate of 10 Hz, with a maximum energy of 55
mJ. For the present measurements, 10 mJ pulses were focused to intensities of 1016 W
cm−2 by means of a 25 cm planoconvex lens. A halfwave plate placed just before the lens
was used to control the polarization vector of the laser light. Laser-cluster interactions
occured ∼26 cm downstream of the skimmer. The ions formed when the laser and cluster
beams were temporally coincident in the interaction zone were detected by a channel electron
multiplier (CEM) placed at the end of a 58 cm long ﬂight tube which was mutually orthogonal
to the laser and cluster beams. A three-grid retarding potential energy analyzer (RPA),

3

of length 1 cm, with an intergrid separation of 5 mm, was placed in front of the CEM.
Application of appropriate positive voltages on the central grid enabled two-dimensional,
charge-discriminated energy spectra to be obtained, in a manner that has been described in
earlier reports [5,12]. Cluster formation was veriﬁed by measuring the Rayleigh scattered
signal from the clusters using 355 nm light from an Nd:YAG laser. Hagena’s scaling law [13]
was used to estimate cluster size; the average size of (N2)n clusters ranged from n=50 at a
stagnation pressure of 2 bar to n=3000 at 10 bar.

Fig. 1 shows the ion energy distribution for two cluster sizes at an intensity of 7×1015
W cm−2, when the laser light is polarized along the TOF axis as well as perpendicular to it.
There is a high-energy component in the distribution (at energies ≥3-5 keV) that exhibits a
distinct asymmetry: ion energies and ﬂuxes are enhanced when the laser polarization vector
is parallel to the TOF axis. The low-energy component of the distribution (at energies
≤3-5 keV) is found to be isotropic. This type of behavior is consistent with that observed
in atomic clusters [5,6]. However, with (N2)n clusters, there is a new feature: a very low-
energy component (at energies ≤40 eV) that is also asymmetric (see the inset in ﬁg.1). This
component has no analog in measurements with atomic clusters and we ascribe it to the
ionization signal from unclustered N2 molecules that are present in the supersonic beam.
The asymmetry that is observed is attributed to spatial alignment of the molecular axis
along the laser polarization vector, a feature of laser-molecule interactions that has been
well studied [2,14]. We note that N2 has a very low value of the empirical constant in the
Hagena parameter [13], indicating that this molecule has low propensity for clustering; thus
we observe a component of unclustered N2 molecules that also emerges from the skimmer.
Variation of cluster size does not result in alteration of the overall morphology of the
energy distribution function but for a shift in the energy value at which the isotropic and
anisotropic components meet. This point, which we refer to as the “knee”, shifts progres-
sively towards lower energies as the cluster size is reduced. Fig. 2 shows the experimentally
measured ion spectra for diﬀerent pressures, when the laser light is polarized along the TOF
axis.

The maximum value of ion energy, Emax, as (N2)n explodes under Coulombic pressure

is from ions that are on the outer surface of the spherical cluster and is given by

Emax ∝

Q¯qnc
R

,

(1)

where ¯q is the average charge per nitrogen ion in a cluster, of radius R, comprising nc
nitrogen molecules, and Q is the charge on the ion that is detected. It is established that nc
varies as P 2 [11,13], where P is the stagnation pressure in the supersonic nozzle and, since nc
scales with cluster size as R3, it is clear that the ion maximum energy, Emax, should scale as
P 4/3. This analysis is based upon two assumptions: (i) at a given laser intensity, the average
charge does not appreciably change with cluster size, and (ii) cluster expansion is such that
the radius of the expanding cluster at the end of the laser pulse is proportional to the
initial radius. Results of extensive numerical simulations of cluster explosions that Last and
Jortner [15] have carried out provide ample justiﬁcation for the validity of both assumptions.
Fig. 3 depicts the “knee” energy that we have measured for diﬀerent values of stagnation
pressure, P . A ﬁt to our data (solid line in ﬁg. 2) shows that the “knee” energy scales as
P α, where α=1.5±0.2, which is in consonance with expectations from the our analysis. This
brings to the fore the necessity of having to invoke an additional acceleration mechanism,

4

over and above Coulombic pressure, to account for ions that possess energies in excess of the
“knee” energy. By working with clusters of relatively small size we exclude the possibility of
hydrodynamic pressure coming into play. In this connection it has not escaped our attention
that ion energies at values less than the knee energy scale approximately quadratically with
ion charge for the clusters under study.

The anisotropy that is observed for the highest energy ions, beyond the “knee” energy,
provides a clue as to the nature of this additional acceleration mechanism. As has been
observed in earlier work on Arn clusters [5], and in numerical simulations of explosions of
clusters such as Xe147 [16], that the charge state of an ion can rapidly change in resonance
with the applied optical ﬁeld. The radial ﬁeld due to the charged cluster and the applied
laser ﬁeld act in the same direction for half the optical cycle, and a high ionic charge
state can be attained. But, in the next half cycle, these two ﬁelds oppose each other,
and the net charge is reduced from its maximum value due to ion-electron recombination.
This charge ﬂipping gives rise to a net cycle-averaged force that serves to accelerate the
ions. The simulations carried out by Ishikawa and Blenski for Xe147 [16] showed that such
acceleration is much smaller for ions that are ejected perpendicular to the laser polarization
vector. Measurements carried out by us [5] on Ar40000 demonstrated asymmetry in the high
energy component of Arq+ (q ≤8) ions produced in the Coulomb explosion regime, and
subsequent measurements on explosions of Xe150000 in the hydrodynamics expansion regime
indicated that the asymmetry is likely to be a feature that is independent of the regime in
which the explosion takes place. The present measurements on small (N2)n clusters provide
veriﬁcation of the earlier conjectures.

In summary, measurements of ion energies of the explosion products from (N2)n (n=50-
3000) clusters provide evidence for formation of energetic ions in very high charge states.
The ion energy distribution has a low-energy isotropic component, whose maximum en-
ergy is accounted for by simple Coulombic considerations. Over and above this, there is a
not-insubstantial ﬂux of ions that have energy in excess of the Coulombic limit. Our mea-
surements provide evidence for a charge-ﬂipping mechanism that accounts for the additional
acceleration that is experienced by the exploding ions. It also rationalizes the asymmetry
with respect to laser polarization that is observed for these high energy ions. Exploitation
of this additional acceleration mechanism might be of utility in future considerations of
tabletop accelerators.

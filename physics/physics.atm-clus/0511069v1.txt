A simple scheme of population and detection of low-lying electronic quadrupole modes in free
small deformed metal clusters is proposed. The scheme is analyzed in terms of the TDLDA (time-
dependent local density approximation) calculations. As test case, the deformed cluster N a+
11 is con-
sidered. Long-living quadrupole oscillations are generated via resonant two-photon (two-dipole) exci-
tation and then detected through the appearance of satellites in the photoelectron spectra generated
by a probe pulse. Femtosecond pump and probe pulses with intensities I = 2 · 1010 − 2 · 1011W/cm2
and pulse duration T = 200 − 500 fs are found to be optimal. The modes of interest are dominated
by a single electron-hole pair and so their energies, being combined with the photoelectron data for
hole states, allow to gather new information about mean-ﬁeld spectra of valence electrons in the
HOMO-LUMO region. Besides, the scheme allows to estimate the lifetime of electron-hole pairs and
hence the relaxation time of electronic energy into ionic heat.

In recent years, the analysis of cluster structure and
dynamics has made remarkable progress in going beyond
mere optical absorption spectroscopy. More and more
observables are now being accessed with methods which
had been applied successfully in atomic and molecular
physics, as e.g. measuring angular distributions, pho-
toelectron spectra (PES), or pump and probe scenarios,
for an overview see [1]. For example, PES have attracted
much interest, see e.g.
[2, 3, 4, 5]. They allow to de-
termine the energies ǫh of the occupied (hole) electron
levels in the mean ﬁeld of the cluster. Altogether, cluster
studies are shifting from the investigation of global prop-
erties (like, e.g. the dipole plasmon) to exploring more
detailed features, as e.g. the single-electron states in the
cluster mean ﬁeld. These novel observables are important
not only for clusters but for any nano-system since they
deepen the understanding and promote the development
of experimental techniques.

In spite of impressive achievements, atomic clusters
bear still a variety of unexplored features. For example,
clusters have a rich excitation spectrum of higher multi-
polarities λ > 1, beyond the well studied dipole modes.
As is discussed below, low-lying non-collective excitations
of this family give access to the single-electron spectra
and allow to estimate some principle time scales rele-
vant for clusters and other nano-systems. However, the
standard one-photon absorption experiments are blind to
non-dipole states. Other means of analysis as, e.g., in-
elastic electron scattering did not yet come very far due
to the small energies involved. It is the aim of present
contribution to discuss a possible pathway to the par-
ticular kind of non-dipole spectra, quadrupole (λ = 2)
non-collective modes. The novel pump/probe technique
with using laser two-photon process will be proposed for
population and detection of these modes.

It is a challenging task as such to get access to
quadrupole modes. Moreover, the low-lying quadrupoles
carry useful information about the unoccupied electron
states near the Fermi surface. The modes are predomi-
nantly of electron-hole (eh) type [6], whose spectra are
the mere energy diﬀerences ǫeh = ǫe − ǫh. Knowing the
hole state ǫh from other sources, allows then to conclude
on the involved particle energies ǫe. A further interesting
observable is the lifetime τeh of an eh pair since it pro-
vides the time scale of the transfer of electronic energy
into internal energy ( mainly ionic motion and to some
extend higher correlated electron states). The value τeh
is important for many processes, e.g., for deﬁning diﬀer-
ent regimes of multi-photon ionization (MPI) in atomic
clusters [5]. Being determined by electron-ion correla-
tions, τeh should be much longer than the lifetime of the
dipole plasmon. However, very little is known experi-
mentally. As is shown below, the scheme we propose is
also appropriate for measurement of the lifetime τeh.

Low-lying (infrared=IR) electronic quadrupole states
in free small deformed clusters seem to be most appro-
priate for our aims [6]. Beams of size selected small
clusters are readily available. In free small clusters, the
IR electronic spectra are dilute, which simpliﬁes their
experimental discrimination. Thus we concentrate here
on these species. Deformed clusters are needed, because
most of the IR quadrupole states arise due to the clus-
ter deformation and are absent in spherical clusters (see
the upper plot in Fig. 1). This then provides a further
indicator of the cluster shape. And, as outlined above,
low-lying quadrupole states in small deformed clusters
give access to eh energies since they can be, to a good
approximation, considered as pure eh states [6].

Quadrupole states cannot be populated in mere photo-
absorption where dipole modes dominate. One has to use

two-photon (two-dipole) processes. An option is one of
the diﬀerent versions of the stimulated Raman process
(e.g., oﬀ-resonant Raman itor stimulated Raman adia-
batic passage (STIRAP) [7]) which steps up via an in-
termediate dipole state. These methods use three laser
pulses: pump, Stokes and probe. They may be appli-
cable to atomic clusters when choosing appropriate laser
parameters [8].

In the present paper, we will consider an alternative,
probably simpler, scheme using direct two-photon exci-
tation in resonance with the ﬁnal quadrupole state (see
Fig.1b)). To detect the successful population of the
quadrupole states, the cluster is irradiated by a probe
pulse (with appropriate delay) leading to MPI. The cor-
responding PES are recorded. The quadrupole oscillation
couples with the single-electron PES structures and thus
manifests itself via satellites in the PES. In this scheme
we need only two lasers, pump and probe. As is shown
below, intense fs lasers are most appropriate.

As a test case for our computational simulation, we
consider Na+
11 in jellium approximation. This clus-
ter is strongly prolate and displays well separated low-
lying quadrupole states. The calculations are performed
within the time-dependent local density approximation
(TDLDA) with the exchange-correlation functional [9].
The ions are treated in the soft jellium approximation
[1]. This approximation, although a bit daring to small
metal clusters, is well suited for the exploration of the
two-photon method in N a+
11 which is axially symmetric
in jellium. Besides, this allows to perform the calcula-
tions on an axial grid in coordinate space. Absorbing
boundary conditions are employed for the description of
photoionization. The excitation spectra in the linear re-
sponse regime are computed using TDLDA by standard
techniques of spectral analysis [10, 11]. The laser induced
dynamics is simulated by adding to the TDLDA the laser
pulses (propagating in z-direction) as classical external
dipole ﬁelds of the form W (t) = E0 z sin2(t/T ) cos(ωt)
where E0 is the ﬁeld strength (∝ square root of the in-
tensity I), ω the frequency, and T the pulse duration
[1, 10].

Fig. 1 demonstrates the spectra of N a+

11. Panel a)
shows the single-electron states. The ground state is de-
formed. Comparison with the spherical spectrum shows
that the axial deformation splits the single-electron spec-
tra and hence the energies of eh pairs. Following the
scheme, only three low-lying quadrupole eh excitations,
{[220], [200]}20, {[220], [211]}21, and {[220], [202]}22, ex-
ist in N a+
11 and the last two of them are fully driven by
the cluster deformation. The associated excitation en-
ergies are small because they are mainly determined by
the deformation splitting. Panel b) shows the relevant
part of the excitation spectrum in terms of the dipole
(λµ = 10) and quadrupole (λµ = 20) strengths. The
modes with µ > 0 (and thus the excitations λµ = 21 and
22) are not presented here. To illustrate our method it is

The spherical levels are marked by oscillator quantum num-
bers nl and the deformed levels by the Nilsson-Clemenger
notation [N nzΛ] [12]. Occupied and unoccupied levels are
drawn by solid or dotted lines, respectively. Arrows depict
infrared eh excitations with multipolarity λµ =20, 21 and 22.

quite enough to consider only one low-energy quadrupole
mode, namely that of λµ =20. This mode is seen as a
peak at the energy e20 =0.8 eV.

Figure 1 shows that the only habitants of the IR region
below 1.3 eV are three low-energy quadrupole excitations
indicated by arrows in the panel a). Both dipole and
quadrupole plasmons lie well above. The lowest dipole
eh excitation also resides above, at 1.4 eV. So, the IR
part of the spectrum we are interested in is indeed very
dilute. This favors the experimental discrimination of the
quadrupole levels. Moreover, the well separated levels are
not subject to collective mixing and thus preserve their
eh nature.

The lifetime of the low-lying quadrupole states proba-
bly does not exceed several ps. The exciting laser pulses
should be shorter, say hundreds fs. They have to be in-
tense enough to excite the quadrupole mode in the two-
photon process and to yield a measurable PES. On the
other hand, the pulses should not be too intense in order
to keep the resolution in the PES. As is shown below,
the optimal intensity is I = 2 · 1010 − 2 · 1011W/cm2.
The simplest case of one-photon (n=1) ionization cannot
be applied here, since the low-order ionization would de-
mand lasers operating in the ultraviolet (UV). But UV

left panels exhibit quadrupole and dipole strengths as func-
tion of the excitation energy. The right panels depict the
electronic quadrupole and dipole moments (in atomic units)
as a function of time. The pump (ﬁrst) and probe (second)
pulses are clearly seen. The calculations are performed for
laser intensities Ipump = Iprobe = 1011W/cm2 and pulse du-
rations Tpump = Tprobe = 300f s.

lasers with suﬃcient intensities are available only in the
ns regime which is useless for our purposes. So, we are
enforced to deal with fs lasers and multi-photon ioniza-
tion (MPI). To minimize the MPI order n, it is desirable
to work at the minimal wavelength available from fs laser
systems. In the present study, we use the laser radiation
at ~ωprobe = 3.2 eV, which corresponds to the second
harmonic frequency of a titanium sapphire laser. The
MPI order is then n = 2. The tunable IR pump pulse
may be provided by fs optical-parametric generators.

Fig. 2 exhibits the ﬁrst step of our scheme, the popu-
lation of the λµ = 20 quadrupole state. The right pan-
els shows time evolution of the dipole and quadrupole
oscillations caused by the pump pulse. The resonant
(2~ωpump = 2 · 0.40 eV = e20 = 0.80 eV) and oﬀ-resonant
(2~ωpump = 2·0.34 eV 6= e20 = 0.80 eV) cases are consid-
ered. It is obvious that only the resonant case develops
self-sustaining quadrupole oscillation. Since electron-ion
relaxation is not taken into account here, this oscillation
persists for several ps and further. But the dipole oscil-
lates only during the pump pulse at t = 0 - 300 fs. In
the oﬀ-resonant case, both quadrupole and dipole modes
respond only during the pump pulse. The left panels ex-
hibit the corresponding dipole and quadrupole strengths.
Note that in the resonant case (left upper panel), the
quadrupole mode of interest at 0.80 eV dominates all
other modes. This resonant suppression of competitors
is crucial for producing the clean satellites in PES later
on. The quadrupole mode as excited by the resonant

two-photon excitation continues to oscillate for a while.
The population of this mode can thus be checked by a
suﬃciently delayed probe pulse. This pulse is shown at t
= 600 - 900 fs. The pulse delay 600 fs (equal to the dou-
ble pulse duration) suﬃces to all other (virtual) modes to
relax to zero, except of the long-living mode of interest.
The probe pulse leads to strong photoionization and
the resulting PES provides information about the clus-
ter state before ionization. The upper panel of Fig. 3
shows the PES for the oﬀ-resonant case, which is typical
for the cluster ground state [13]. The structures corre-
sponding to single-electron hole states 1d, 1p and 1s are
well visible. The lower panel shows the PES for the res-
onant case. One recognizes additional satellites in the
spectra which are shifted just by the quadrupole energy
±0.8 eV with respect to the leading peaks, as indicated
by the arrows. They emerge from the coupling of the
quadrupole mode with the single-electron states. Only
the strongest 1d and 1p PES structures have signiﬁcant
satellites. The most remarkable satellite is at ekin ∼ 1
eV. The interpretation of the quadrupole energy in terms
of eh diﬀerences ǫeh = ǫe − ǫh is to be taken with a bit of
care. The state can involve a small coupling to collective
quadrupole strength. Detailed analysis shows that the
λµ=20 mode in Fig. 2 contains a small collective blue-
shift of < 0.1 eV as compared with the energy of the
pure {[220], [200]}20 conﬁguration. However, this shift is
within the accuracy of the typical PES measurements.

The proposed scheme allows to obtain not only the
frequency of the quadrupole mode but also its lifetime.
To that end, one should simply increase, step by step,
the delay between the pump and probe pulses. The re-
laxation of quadrupole oscillation will ﬁnally lead to an
extinction of the satellites from which one can read oﬀ
the lifetime. This feature cannot be tested in our present
model where eh states have inﬁnite lifetime.

In Fig. 4 the sensitivity of the process to the pulse in-
tensity is tested. The PES structures and their satellites
are strong and can be well discriminated for intensities
I = 2 · 1010 − 2 · 1011W/cm2. Smaller intensities result in

too weak photoelectron yield while higher intensities lead
to considerable broadening the PES (see also [13]). The
calculations with the ﬁxed intensity I = 1011W/cm2 (as
in Figs. 2 and 3) but diﬀerent pulse durations show that
values of T = 200 − 500f s are most optimal. Altogether,
the optimal intervals for pulse intensities and durations
are comfortably broad which is a promising feature for
future experiments.

Let us ﬁnally outline the proposed experiment. One
needs a synchronized tunable infrared pump pulse and
UV probe pulse. The optimum probe parameters are
found by scanning the intensities while looking at the
PES from the ground state. Here our predictions for the
optimal pulse intensities and durations can be used as a
ﬁrst guide. The largest intensity which still produces well
discriminated peaks is to be chosen. A similar intensity
will be appropriate for the pump pulse (although sepa-
rate tuning may improve the results). One then scans
the pump frequency for a probe pulse delay of order of
the double pulse length and watches the appearance of
the satellites. The maximum satellite signal provides the
quadrupole energy in two ways, ﬁrst as the double pump
frequency and second, as a countercheck, from the oﬀset
of the satellites. In a last step, one can vary the pulse
delay to ﬁnd out the lifetime of the quadrupole state.

The low-energy spectra are sensitive to thermal ﬂuc-
tuations of the cluster conﬁguration. Our survey deals
with a ﬁxed ground state conﬁguration. Thus it is advis-
able to work at low temperatures (less 100 K) to avoid

broadening of the signal and other artifacts. Our calcu-
lations show that the photoelectron yield from the satel-
lites should be ne ∼ 10−5 electrons per cluster and laser
pulse. Then, assuming typical parameters of available
cluster beams [14] and lasers with kHz repetition, one
ﬁnds that ne still should be measurable even under ad-
ditional damping eﬀects (electron-ion correlations, pos-
sible probe-induced multi-plasmon excitations [15], ran-
dom orientation of clusters in the beam).

In conclusion, we propose a simple scheme for the pop-
ulation and detection of non-collective (electron-hole) in-
frared quadrupole states in small deformed atomic clus-
ters.
It relies on a pump-and-probe technique where
the pump pulse excites the quadrupole mode via a two-
photon process and the probe pulse explores the resulting
quadrupole oscillations through satellites in the photo-
electron spectra. Already the measurement of low-lying
quadrupole states in itself is an achievement as such.
Moreover, it can deliver information about the single-
electron spectrum directly above the Fermi energy and
about the relaxation time for the electron-hole pairs. The
proposed scheme is quite general and can be applied to
any clusters provided their electronic infrared spectrum
is suﬃciently dilute.

We have observed several new spectral features in the ﬂuorescence of cesium atoms implanted in
the hcp phase of solid helium following laser excitation to the 62P states. Based on calculations of
the emission spectra using semiempirical Cs-He pair potentials the newly discovered lines can be
assigned to the decay of speciﬁc Cs∗Hen exciplexes: an apple-shaped Cs(AΠ3/2)He2 and a dumbbell-
shaped Cs(AΠ1/2)Hen exciplex with a well deﬁned number n of bound helium atoms. While the
former has been observed in other enviroments, it was commonly believed that exciplexes with n > 2
might not exist. The calculations suggest Cs(AΠ1/2)He6 to be the most probable candidate for that
exciplex, in which the helium atoms are arranged on a ring around the waist of the dumbbell shaped
electronic density distribution of the cesium atom.

Alkali atoms and helium atoms in their ground states
strongly repel each other by virtue of the Pauli principle.
However, an alkali atom excited to one of its P states
can exert an attractive potential on a helium atom that
can lead to bound states, known as exciplexes. The for-
mation of alkali-helium exciplexes was considered for the
ﬁrst time by Dupont-Roc [1] and Karnorsky et al. [2] as
an explanation for the observed quenching of atomic ﬂu-
orescence from light alkali atoms (Na, Li) embedded in
liquid or solid 4He. In the meantime such molecules have
been observed in diﬀerent environments, such as liquid
helium and cold helium gas [3, 4] , as well as on the sur-
face of helium nanodroplets [5, 6, 7, 8] . Here we present
the ﬁrst observations of such exciplexes in a solid helium
matrix.

In earlier experiments [2] we have studied the excita-
tion and ﬂuorescence spectra of atomic cesium implanted
into the bcc and hcp phases of solid helium. It was found
that the excitation at the D1 transition (6S1/2-6P1/2) re-
sults in atomic ﬂuorescence at the same transition, blue
shifted (with respect to the free Cs atom) by the interac-
tion with the helium matrix. At the same time, excita-
tion on the D2 transition (6S1/2-6P3/2) produced merely
a weak ﬂuorescence on the D1 emission line, which indi-
cates that the 6P3/2 atoms are partly quenched into the
6P1/2 state, while the main relaxation channel remained
unknown. Recently, the extension of the spectral range
of our detection system allowed us to discover several new
emission lines, red shifted with respect to the atomic ﬂu-
orescence line. We attribute those lines to the formation
and decay of Cs∗Hen molecules.

The maximal number of helium atoms for diﬀer-
ent alkali-helium exciplexes was found previously to be
nmax = 4 for K∗Hen [8], nmax = 6 for Rb∗Hen [4],
nmax = 2 for Cs∗Hen [3]. Hirano et al.

cuss on the basis of Cs∗He2-He potential energy sur-
faces that there should be no stable Cs∗He3 conﬁgura-
tion. They therefore conclude that exciplexes with more
than nmax = 2 do not exist, since they regard the exci-
plex formation as a sequential process (Cs∗ →Cs∗He1 →
... →Cs∗Henmax). However, our experimental results
demonstrate unambiguously that in the hcp phase of
solid helium Cs(AΠ1/2)Hen exciplexes with n > 2 are
formed, when the cesium atoms are excited to the 6P3/2
state. From the relative integrated observed line inten-
sities we conclude that the formation of those exciplexes
is the most probable deexcitation channel of the 6P3/2
state.

In the present experiment a 4He matrix doped with Cs
atoms was produced by the technique described in our
earlier papers [9, 10]. Data were taken in the hcp phase
of solid 4He at a temperature of 1.5 K and a pressure
of 31.6 bar. For the excitation of the embedded atoms
we used a single mode cw Ti:Al2O3-laser, pumped by
a Nd:YVO3 laser. The laser wavelength was tuned to
the D2 absorption line of cesium, whose resonance wave-
length is shifted to 800 nm due to the inﬂuence of the sur-
rounding helium matrix. The atomic ﬂuorescence light
from the sample volume (∼ 3 mm3) is detected by a ﬁber
coupled optical spectrum analyzer (Ando Co. Ltd., AQ-
6315A) which has a detection range of 350-1750 nm. The
spectral resolution was limited to about 5 nm.

Fig. 1 shows a typical recorded emission spectrum, as
well as calculated spectra of several Cs∗Hen exciplexes.
The smallest peak at 11400 cm−1 corresponds to ﬂuo-
rescence on the D1 transition, indicating the existence
of a transfer channel between 6P3/2 and 6P1/2 states.
That process was studied before, in experiments with su-
perﬂuid helium [11]. Another emission line appears at
10520 cm−1. We attribute this broad and asymmetric
peak to the emission of Cs(AΠ3/2)He2 exciplexes, which
had previously been observed in liquid helium and in cold
helium gas [3]. The peak presented here is blue-shifted
with respect to the one reported in [3] by approximately
500 cm−1. The shift is due to the inﬂuence of the helium

FIG. 1: Measured emission spectrum (dots) of matrix-isolated
Cs atoms in the hcp phase of solid 4He. The ﬂuorescence

matrix and increases with helium pressure. The detailed
study of that dependence in the bcc and hcp phases of
solid helium will be presented elsewhere [12]. There is
yet another prominent emission line at 7130 cm−1, with a
linewidth of 1010 cm−1 (FWHM), which is almost three
times stronger than the former peak. Our theoretical
model suggests that this newly discovered intense emis-
sion line can be assigned to a higher order (n > 2) exci-
plex.

We have calculated the emission spectra of Cs∗Hen ex-
ciplexes with a treatment similar to those of [3, 4]. We
consider only the inﬂuence of the n helium atoms that
form the exciplex and neglect the inﬂuence of the bulk of
the surrounding helium matrix. The interaction between
one cesium atom and the n He atoms is described as the
sum over adiabatic molecular two-body interaction po-
tentials. We use the pair potentials between a helium
ground state atom and alkali atoms in their ground and
lower excited states calculated by Pascale [13]. For the
6S ground state that potential, V 6s
σ (r), is radially sym-
metric. For the 6P states the interaction is anisotropic
and can be expressed by the operator

where r = r(r, θ, ϕ) denotes the position vector of a he-

are formed by two helium atoms located on a common
axis on opposite sides of the cesium atom. For Cs∗Hen≥3
the helium atoms are distributed on a concentric ring

by summing over the corresponding VHe-He(R) poten-
tials between neighboring helium atoms using the semi-
empirical potential given by Beck [14]. The distance R
between two neighboring helium atoms is a function of
the cesium–helium separation r and the number n of he-
lium atoms: R = |ri − ri+1| = 2r sin(π/n). After includ-
ing the spin-orbit interaction in Cs the total interaction
potential of the Cs∗Hen system reads

where ∆ = 554.0 cm−1 is the ﬁne-structure splitting
of the free cesium 6P state and S the electronic spin
operator. VCs∗Hen (r) is diagonalized algebraically.
In
Figs. 2 and 3 the resulting r-dependencies of the eigenval-
ues are shown for Cs∗He2 and Cs∗He6 respectively. The
same plots also show the ground state potentials given
by nV 6s
σ (r) + nVHe -He(R). The potentials are labelled
according to their electronic conﬁgurations as X 2Σ1/2,
A2Π1/2, A2Π3/2 and B2Σ1/2. The quantization axis is
deﬁned by the symmetry axis of the exciplexes, which is
the internuclear axis of the cesium atom and the two
helium atoms in the case of Cs∗Hen=1,2, whereas for
Cs∗Hen≥3 it is the axis of the helium ring. Pictographs
next to the curves show the variation of the cesium elec-
tronic density as the n helium atoms, indicated by two
ﬁlled circles, approach the cesium atom.

From the adiabatic potentials of Figs. 2 and 3 one sees
that the helium atoms, due to the Pauli principle, are re-
pelled by the cesium valence electron. However, in cases
where the atoms approach along a nodal line or in a nodal
plane of the electron distribution they experience an at-
tractive van der Waals force until they are repelled by the
cesium core. This deﬁnitely holds for the Cs(AΠ3/2)He2
exciplex. For Cs(AΠ1/2)He2 the situation is more com-
plicated. When the two helium atoms are far away the
electronic conﬁguration is the one of the 6P1/2 state of
the free cesium atom, which has a spherical symmetry
and is hence, as the 6S1/2 ground state, repulsive for
the helium atoms. However, when the helium atoms ap-
proach the cesium atom the electronic wave function of
the latter is deformed and becomes apple-shaped. This
new conﬁguration now oﬀers a binding potential mini-
mum. The formation of this second conﬁguration has a
potential barrier of 79 cm−1, which is much higher than
the thermal energy of 1.0 cm−1. If, on the other hand,
the two atoms do not approach simultaneously, but one
after the other, only the ﬁrst atom has to overcome the
potential barrier thereby forming the apple-like electronic
conﬁguration of a Cs∗He1 structure, which then becomes
attractive for a second helium atom approaching from
the opposite side. A third helium atom approaching the
Cs(AΠ1/2)He2 exciplex will again be repelled. However,
if it comes suﬃciently close, the electronic conﬁguration
changes to a dumbbell shape, which has a binding min-
imum for the three helium atoms. Here too, a potential

FIG. 2: Adiabatic potentials of the Cs∗He2 system, including
the spin-orbit interaction. The two helium atoms are located

indicated in the pictographs by a solid line. The shape of the

signiﬁcantly as helium atoms (ﬁlled circles) approach.

barrier has to be overcome. The three atoms are then
bound and located on a ring concentric around the waist
of the dumbbell. The Cs(AΠ1/2)He3 structure exerts
a purely attractive potential on further helium atoms.
With an increasing number of helium atoms on the ring
the repulsive potential between those atoms increases,
which puts a natural limit on the maximum number nmax
that can be accommodated. Only the AΠ1/2 state can
bind more than two helium atoms as can be seen from
Fig. 3.

It was pointed out by Dupont-Roc [1] that the height of
the potential barrier is determined by the strength of the
spin-orbit interaction of the P state. If the L-S coupling is
weak compared to the alkali-helium interaction as in the
case of Na, K, and Rb, it can be neglected and the elec-
tronic conﬁguration can be approximated by a Pz orbital
that allows the formation of dumbbell-shaped exciplexes
with n > 2. If on the other hand the spin-orbit inter-
action dominates, as for cesium, one has to consider the
electron distributions of the L-S-coupled P1/2 and P3/2
states, which are spherical in the ﬁrst case and of apple
shape in the second case, thereby restricting nmax to 2.
In contrast to this simple model our treatment takes into
account that the electronic conﬁguration changes adia-
batically its shape as helium atoms approach.

FIG. 3: Adiabatic potentials of the Cs∗He6 system. The six
helium atoms are located on a ring of radius r concentric with
the symmetry axis. Only the A2Π1/2 potential has a binding
attractive well.

We calculated the adiabatic potentials and the vibra-
tional zero-point energies for all Cs∗Hen systems up to
n = 9. The treatment of the molecular vibrations is
approximate and will be described elsewhere. Higher vi-
brational states are not populated at the temperature
of the experiments and can be neglected, as well as the
contributions from rotations.

The n dependence of the zero-point energies for
Cs(AΠ1/2)Hen exciplexes is represented in Fig. 4 by ﬁlled
circles. Also shown are the heights of the potential bar-
riers (open sqares) and the depths of the potential min-
ima (open circles). All energies are given with respect
to the dissociation limit, i.e., the electronic energy of
the 6P1/2 state. The signiﬁcant increase of the poten-
tial barrier when going from n = 2 to n = 3 reﬂects the
discussion given above. The conﬁguration with n = 8
has the deepest attractive potential, while its zero-point
energy due to the stronger localization of helium atoms
exceeds the barrier energy, which makes that complex
unstable. Cs(AΠ1/2)He7 seems to be the largest possible
quasi-bound exciplex. Only the molecule with n = 6 has
an energy below the dissociation limit and is hence pre-
dicted to be stable. Note that for rubidium several con-
ﬁgurations are predicted to be stable and Rb(AΠ1/2)Hen
exciplexes with n = 1 . . . 6 have been observed recently
[4].

In a last step we calculated the shape of the emis-

FIG. 4: Energy dependencies of the Cs(A2Π1/2)Hen exci-
plexes as a function of the number n of helium atoms. Shown
are the minimal energies (open circles) of the potential wells,
the barrier heights (open squares) and the total zero-point
energies (ﬁlled circles). All energies are given with respect to

state. Corresponding points are joined by lines to guide the

sion lines by using the Franck-Condon approximation in
a similar way as the authors of [3]. Among all exciplexes
considered, the best agreement of the calculated spectra
with the experimental ones is provided by those shown
in Fig. 1 by solid curves. The shape and width of the
line at 10520 cm−1 agrees well with the calculated emis-
sion line of Cs(AΠ3/2)He2. However, the apparently ex-
cellent agreement between the positions of these lines is
accidental as the pressure shift, i.e., the inﬂuence of the
surrounding helium matrix was not taken into account.
In fact, K. Enomoto et al. [3] measured the emission line
of Cs(AΠ3/2)He2 exciplexes in cold helium vapor envi-
ronment to lie at about 10000 cm−1. We like to men-
tion that that we have also observed ﬂuorescence from
Cs(AΠ1/2)He2 exciplexes, not discussed here, following
D1 excitation [12, 15]. Such exciplexes were also observed

4

recently on cesium doped He clusters [16].

The correct assignment of the strongest measured peak
at 7130 cm−1 in Fig. 1 is a more subtle task. It is clear
that the line originates from a Cs(AΠ1/2)Hen>2 exciplex,
in which the helium atoms form a ring in the nodal plane
of the Cs atom. It is very likely that this line also shifts
with helium pressure. Moreover, as the ring-shaped exci-
plexes contain a larger number of helium atoms any im-
precision of the initial pair potentials will be ampliﬁed.
As a consequence the line positions of the higher order
Cs∗Hen systems cannot be predicted with suﬃcient accu-
racy to allow an unambiguous assignment of the observed
line. The overall good agreement between calculated and
measured lineshapes indicates that the line at 7130 cm−1
originates from the decay of an exciplex with a speciﬁc
number n of bound helium atoms and that it is not a su-
perposition of lines from exciplexes with diﬀerent values
of n. Such superpositions were observed in the case of
Rb∗Hen exciplexes in cold 4He vapor [4]. The theoretical
considerations suggest, as a best guess, that the observed
peak at 7130 cm−1 originates from decaying Cs∗He6 com-
plexes, as those exciplexes have minimal energy and are
the only ones predicted to be stable.

In summary, we have performed a study of laser in-
duced ﬂuorescence of cesium atoms trapped in the hcp
phase of a helium crystal. We have reported the obser-
vation of new spectral features, which are broader and
more intense than the pure atomic lines. We believe that
those lines are formed by the emission from two types of
speciﬁc Cs∗Hen exciplex structures, viz., an apple-shaped
complex with two helium atoms bound to the Cs atom
and a dumbbell-shaped complex, in which a ring of he-
lium atoms is bound to the nodal plane of the Cs wave
function. These assignments are supported by model cal-
culations, which allow us to obtain the corresponding
emission spectra. In the case of the ring structure the
calculations suggest n = 6 as the most likely number of
bound atoms.

We like to thank J. Pascale for sending us his numerical
Cs-He pair potentials. This work was supported by a
grant of the Schweizerischer Nationalfonds.

Abstract. We analyze the dynamics of up to 105 electrons resulting from illuminating a Xenon cluster with
9093 atoms with intense laser pulses of diﬀerent length and peak intensity. Interesting details of electron
motion are identiﬁed which can be probed with a time resolution of 100 attoseconds. Corresponding
experiments would shed light on unexplored territory in complex electronic systems such as clusters and
they would also permit to critically access the present theoretical description of this dynamics.

1 Introduction

Recent advance in laser technology has led to the creation
of subfemtosecond (100 attosecond) strong laser pulses
which allow one in the future to resolve much shorter time
scales in microscopic dynamics [1,2] than it has been pos-
sible so far. More speciﬁcally, while until know vibrational
motion in molecules could be resolved in time experimen-
tally, it will be possible to follow electronic motion with
attosecond resolution. Still, the atomic time unit, i.e., the
period of the ground state electron in hydrogen, is of the
order of 10−17 s, i.e., roughly 10 attoseconds while for now
a pulse length of 100 attoseconds and more is experimen-
tally feasible. However, there are alternative methods such
as tomographic imaging which use the high harmonic spec-
trum of a femtosecond pulse to get attosecond resolved
dynamics. In this way it could be demonstrated that the
electronic wavefunction of a molecule could be directly im-
aged [3]. This is fantastic progress, yet one might argue
that we know in principle the electronic wavefunction of
a diatomic molecule. We can even calculate it, and as it
turns out experimental imaging and theoretical calcula-
tions via a standard solution of the Schr¨odinger equation
agree well [3].

On the other hand, for systems more complex than
a diatomic molecule, e.g., a cluster consisting of many
atoms, we neither know with certainty theoretically the
dynamics of the electrons (we have to make model as-
sumptions) nor do we have a way so far to access the
electron dynamics time resolved in the experiment.

Pioneering experiments [4] have demonstrated non-tri-
vial time dependent dynamics in cluster motion under a
strong laser pulse. This interesting dynamics can be at-
tributed to resonance like behavior where either the next
neighbor ions contribute in a cooperative way to enhance

ionization [5] or the electrons, still bound to the cluster but
not to individual atoms, enter a collective phase of motion
which is susceptible to resonant absorption of radiation
[6]. Besides that, a nonlinear excitation of this resonance
could be relevant [7]. A slightly diﬀerent situation results
from irradiation with VUV pulses as realized with the free
electron laser [8]. There, inverse Bremsstrahlung seems
to be the main mechanism of energy absorption. Details,
however, remain controversial [9,10]. Detailed knowledge
would require the experimental ability to time resolve the
electron motion. Since the electrons are no longer strongly
bound to a single ion but to the extended cluster, there
typical time scale of motion is a bit slower which would
be ideal for probing it with subfemtosecond laser light.

It is the purpose of this paper to explore which kind of
details the electron dynamics exhibits during a standard
femtosecond laser pulse a length of the order of 100 fs.
Speciﬁcally, we will concentrate on energy spectra of elec-
trons from a Xenon cluster with 9093 atoms during the
irradiation with a laser pulse of length from 25 to 400 fs
and peak intensity ranging from 1014 to 1016 W/cm2.

2 Theoretical method

Before we start to discuss the spectra we give a brief ac-
count of the theoretical method how these spectra have
been obtained. The initial cluster conﬁguration is derived
assuming an icosahedral symmetry of the atoms. The faces
of the nth shell contain (n+1)(n+2)/2 atoms. Keeping
only those atoms which are inside a sphere of radius R0 =
50 ˚A yields a cluster with 9093 atoms. This conﬁguration
is relaxed using pairwise Lennard-Jones potentials to ﬁnd
the optimum interatomic distances thereby freezing the
cluster geometry.

with half width T which measures the pulse length, peak
intensity I and the laser frequency of ω = 0.058 a.u. (cor-
responding to 780 nm wavelength). The light is linearly
polarized along the z-axis, denoted by the unit vector ˆz.
To make the simulation tractable we only model explicitly
the outermost bound electron of an atom/ion [6]. In this
way more and more electrons “are generated” due to the
removal from their mother ion during the laser pulse. The
mutual attractive Coulomb potentials have soft cores. All
existing charged particles, ions and electrons, are propa-
gated classically exposed to their mutual attraction and
repulsion as well as to the coupling with the light pulse.
Handling up to about ten electrons per atom implies a
total of up to 105 particles to be propagated over rel-
ative long times (of the order of hundred optical cycles).
This is not possible with standard molecular dynamics but
requires tree-code techniques [11]. Alternatively, one can
start from the particle-in-cell concept to handle clusters
of this size [12].

3 Energy spectra of cluster electrons during
the laser pulse

In this section we present and interpret the energy spec-
tra of the electrons. An overview of the spectra is given
in Fig. 1, the parameters for each panel of ﬁgure Fig. 1 are
provided in Table 1. Basically, for each pulse length T the
peak intensity increases by a factor of 5 from top to bot-
tom (set A to C). For increasing pulse lengths T from left
to right the ﬂuency of the pulse remains the same. Hence,
from one ﬁgure to the next the peak intensity decreases
by a factor of 2 since the pulse length increases by a fac-
tor of 2. All ﬁgures show distributions of total energies
10 keV to
of the electrons on the y-axis ranging from
+5 keV with the total energy of electron i at position ri
with momentum pi deﬁned as

3.1 Common features in all spectra

2 and

A ﬁrst orientation in the plots reveals that the lowest
electron energies go always through a minimum after the
laser pulse has reached its maximum intensity. The mini-
mum assumes quite diﬀerent values, for the parameters
15 keV. The nega-
in Fig. 1 roughly between
−
−
tive electron energies are due to the positive background
a qa of the cluster which is a direct con-
charge Qt =
sequence of ionized electrons which have left the cluster.
They appear at positive energies in the plots. As stronger
the cluster is ionized as deeper the remaining electrons
are bound by the back ground charge. Upon explosion
of the ions the background charge spreads out and con-
sequently, the energy of the trapped electrons decreases
for longer times. Evident are two preferred energy regions
(with high intensities) for the electrons: Ionized electrons
have excess energies close to E = 0. The trapped electrons
prefer energies close to the lowest possible values.

P

3.2 General trends as a function of peak intensity:
The role of the quiver amplitude

The population of the two preferred regions is most promi-
nent in the lower left corner of Fig. 1, i.e., for maximum
peak intensity. For minimum peak intensity (upper right
corner) the opposite trend can be identiﬁed: A substantial
number of electrons ﬁlls the area (of negative energy) be-
tween the two preferred regions. If one compares the equi-
librium size of the cluster given by the radius R0 = 50 ˚A
with the quiver amplitude of an electron in the laser ﬁeld
xω = √I/ω2, listed in Table 1, the reason for this trend
becomes obvious: For largest intensities (lower left corner)
xω > R0 and the ionized electrons are driven far outside
the cluster. The opposite is true for low intensities (up-
per right corner) with the lowest intensities where despite
quivering in the laser ﬁeld the electrons remain well inside
the cluster, leading to a distribution of negative electron
energies due to the attractive background charge.

parameters as shown in Fig. 1.

3.3 The trace of escaping single ions

In the panels corresponding to large pulse lengths and
high peak intensity (lower right corner of Fig. 1) one sees
individual lines of electron energies above the energy mini-
mum and converging to each other for longer times. These
lines are energies of electron being trapped in excited or-
bits around a single ion due to rising interatomic barriers
when the cluster expands. Hence, large pulse lengths are
necessary for this feature. It also occurs in the upper right
corner of Fig. 1 (i.e., for lower intensities) but it is masked
there by other electrons with similar energies. They can-
not leave the cluster since the laser intensity is too low.

3.4 Atomic versus cluster eﬀects

Very short pulses in small clusters explore primarily atomic
properties of the atoms and ions within the cluster since
there is not enough time for a cooperative response of the
cluster as a whole, e.g, by expansion or thermalized col-
lective electron motion. Large clusters, however, develop
upon the ﬁrst atomic ﬁeld ionization for each atom a sub-
stantial positive background charge (in our case roughly

Q = +104 for single ionization of the atoms). The main
mechanism for further ionization is therefore the escape
from the potential generated by the background charge.
It can be modelled by assuming a homogeneously charged
sphere with total charge Qt and (cluster) radius Rt, which
leads to the potential

where quantities with subscript t are weakly time depen-
dent. All electrons in this potential can leave the cluster
if the height of the potential barrier at maximum ﬁeld
strength within a laser period is lower or equal to the po-
tential minimum. This happens at the ﬁeld strength Ft
that shifts the potential minimum from r = 0 to the clus-
ter surface r = Rt, i.e. [dVt(r)/dr]Rt = Ft. From this the
maximum charging of the cluster can be estimated to be

Qt = R2

t Ft .

The depth of the minima in the energy of the electrons in
Fig. 1 indicates directly the charging of the cluster. Hence,
if Eq. (4) is true the depth and the early charging process
in time should agree if the energy (y-axis) in the panels is

scaled by Ft. Indeed, for the three panels A–C belonging
to T = 25 fs and T = 50 fs the temporal development of
the electronic energy until the minimum is reached agrees
very well after scaling (not shown). The considerations
apply as long as the cluster has not expanded yet, i.e.,
Rt
R0. For longer times the cluster expands and the
scaling does not apply.

3.5 Resonant energy absorption through collective
electron motion

If the pulse is long enough to allow for an expansion of
the cluster during the illumination by laser light resonant
absorption becomes possible. The mechanism behind res-
onant absorption in a cluster of the present size is the
match between the frequency of collective electron mo-
tion within the cluster and the laser frequency. This leads
to a characteristic phase lag of π/2 between the oscilla-
tion of the laser amplitude and the electronic response [6].
If one compares Fig. 2 with Fig. 1 one sees that resonant
absorption goes hand in gloves with a sharp decrease of
the minimum electron energy (i.e. a fast charging of the
cluster). This is clearly visible in all panels for T = 400 fs
and in panel A for T = 200 fs. If the resonance occurs
during the fall of the laser envelope (t > 0) it cannot be
directly recognized in the electron energy (compare Fig. 1
with Fig. 2).

3.6 Fine structure on the scale of the optical cycle

Finally, we would like to draw attention to a peculiar be-
havior in the periodic response of continuum electrons and
bound electrons to the driving laser. Most intensity of
such electrons can be found close to E = 0 and close to
the minimum of the electron energies, respectively. Firstly
one sees that the spots of high electron density occur for
bound and continuum electrons with a phase diﬀerence of
half a period, cf. Fig. 3. Secondly, and may be even more
puzzling on a ﬁrst glance, the energy distribution of the
electrons seems to “breeze”, with a narrow distribution at
zero ﬁeld and a wide distribution at maximum ﬁeld for
the bound electrons and exactly the opposite, although
less pronounced, for the continuum electrons, cf. Fig. 4.

The behavior of the continuum electrons (Ei > 0) in
Fig. 3 is easily understood. They have a certain spread
of drift velocities pi or momenta as a result of the en-
ergy absorption and the individual electron has an en-
ergy of Ei = (pi + A(t))2/2 with A(t) = ˆz
≈
ˆzFt/ω sin ωt = ˆzFt/ω cos(ωt
π/2). In other words, since
−
R
these electrons oscillate with a phase lag of π the veloc-
ity or the momentum has a phase lag of π/2. Hence, the
spread of the pi is ampliﬁed due to the squaring in the
energy Ei at zero ﬁeld, as can be seen from the peaks be-
tween the white lines in the upper part of Fig. 3 and from
the corresponding distribution of energies Ei > 0 in Fig. 4
(black curve).

with maximum spread at maximum ﬁeld. This can be
understood if one takes into consideration that the many
electrons in the cluster are an interacting system of charges
which reacts very fast to forces, trying to reach an equi-
librium position and thereby maintaining the spatial dis-
tribution in the cluster. In a ﬁrst approximation it can be
assumed to be incompressible. This distribution is driven
by the laser and has a vanishing phase lag since the eigen-
frequency Ω2
t of the cluster potential Eq. (3) is
larger than the laser frequency ω. Hence, the total energy

To arrive at Eq. (5) from Eq. (2) we, ﬁrstly, replaced the
ionic potential by the cluster potential (3) and, secondly,
neglected the small term quadratic in F . From Eq. (5) it
becomes clear that by monitoring Ei we see essentially the
coupling to the ﬁeld, i.e.,

Ei = E(i)

intense laser pulse at 780 nm wavelength. The spectrum
shows a rich structure on the time scale of the optical
laser period with many interesting details which would be
worthwhile to probe in the future using attosecond tech-
niques. This might be even possible in the near future since
extended systems like a cluster show interesting electron
dynamics on the 100 attosecond time scale while more
tightly bound electrons in atoms or ions are too fast for
direct probing with pulses of 10–100 attosecond length.

Moreover, for now we do not have detailed knowledge
about time resolved electron motion in clusters and such
experiments would also reveal if our way of describing this
dynamics theoretically is adequate.

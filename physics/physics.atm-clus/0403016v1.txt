Abstract. The interaction of short laser pulses with small rare gas clusters is
investigated by using a microscopic, semi-classical model with an explicit treatment of
the inner-atomic dynamics. Field and collisional ionisation as well as recombination
are incorporated self-consistently so that the use of rates for these processes could be
avoided. The laser absorption and ionisation mechanisms in clusters at near-infrared
(800 nm) and VUV wavelength (100 nm) are analysed.

Small rare gas clusters in laser ﬁelds

1. Introduction

Clusters in intense laser ﬁelds were found to absorb laser energy particularly well. The
ions inside such clusters typically assume higher charge states than expected from a
single, isolated atom in the same laser pulse. The reason lies in the complex interplay
between the electric ﬁeld inside the cluster and ionisation, both “inner ionisation,”
that is, the removal of electrons with respect to individual ions, and “outer ionisation”
(i.e., removal of electrons from the cluster as a whole). In experiments at wavelengths
≥ 248 nm highly energetic electrons [1, 2, 3], ions [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], photons [9, 10, 11, 12],
and neutrons originating from nuclear fusion [13] were observed (see Refs. [14, 15] for
reviews). The ﬁrst Xe cluster experiments in the VUV regime at high laser intensities
> 1012 Wcm−2 were performed at the DESY free-electron laser (FEL), Hamburg,
Germany [16], showing higher charge states than expected from single atoms as well,
despite the tiny quiver energies of electrons at such short wavelength.

The interaction of moderately sized clusters with strong laser ﬁelds is commonly
simulated within the framework of molecular dynamics where the inner ionisation is
incorporated via rate equations or ensembles of eﬀectively hydrogen-like Kepler-orbits
(see, e.g., [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]). Instead, in this work a semi-classical approach
with an explicit treatment of the inner-atomic dynamics is pursued. In that way ﬁeld or
collisionally induced ionisation and recombination are included self-consistently so that
any use of rates could be avoided.

The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 the semi-classical cluster model is
introduced before in section 3 the numerical results, especially the ionisation mechanism
and the energy absorption in clusters at 800 and 100 nm are discussed. We conclude in
section 4.

2. Semi-classical model

The rare gas cluster consisting of Na ions of mass M at the positions Ri, 1 ≤ i ≤ Na,
and Z “active” electrons per ion at the positions rj, 1 ≤ j ≤ ZNa in a laser ﬁeld E(t)
is modelled by the Hamiltonian

is introduced [25] that approximately enforces the Heisenberg uncertainty relation
when applied in the form VH(˜rij, ˜pij) = V(˜rij, ˜pij, ξH, αH, µei), where ˜rij = |ri − Rj|,
˜pij = |(Mpi − Pj)/(1 + M)| are relative position and momentum, respectively, and µei
is the reduced mass of electron and ion. Spin eﬀects are neglected but it is worth
noticing that Pauli-blocking could be incorporated in the model [26, 27, 28]. The
bigger the “hardness parameter” αH is chosen, the more severely the uncertainty relation
˜rij ˜pij ≥ ξH is fulﬁlled. However, big αH render the equations of motion stiﬀ so that
in practical calculations a compromise has to be made. ξH is used as a free parameter
for adjusting the relevant physical properties (e.g., ionisation potentials) of the atomic
species under study.

The results presented in this work are obtained by solving the equations of motion
for all electrons and ions corresponding to the Hamiltonian (1) for both a model Xe
atom and a model Xe54 cluster. Only the Z = 6 electrons in the 5p valence shell of
each Xe atom are considered “active.” This is a reasonable assumption for the laser
intensity regime discussed in the present work and signiﬁcantly reduces the numerical
eﬀort. αH = 2 and ξH = 2.33 was chosen which leads to the six ionisation potentials
EI = 0.16, 0.55, 1.11, 1.63, 2.22, 2.65 for an isolated Xe atom in this model while the
real ionisation potentials are (see, e.g., [29, 30]) EI = 0.45, 0.77, 1.18, 1.69, 2.09, 2.64.
The ﬁrst two ionisation potentials of the model are in poor agreement with the correct
values. Unfortunately, we found it not possible to tune all six ionisation potentials to the
correct values by varying the only free parameter ξH (the parameter αH hardly aﬀects
these values [27]). Since it is the generation of the higher charge states in clusters that
is of particular interest to us, ξH was chosen to optimise the higher ionisation potentials.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Single-atom results

The stationary ( ˙r = ˙p = 0) electronic conﬁguration of the single model atom is cubic,
each of the six electrons having the same distance to the ion (|r| = 1.56) and ﬁnite
momentum |p| = 1.49. In order to investigate the enhanced (or reduced) ionisation in
clusters one needs to know the probabilities for the various charge states of the single,
isolated atom. In Fig. 1 the probabilities to ﬁnd a certain charge state are presented
for the two laser wavelengths 800 and 100 nm. The laser pulse was of trapezoidal shape
with an ≈ 8 fs up and down-ramp (corresponding to 3 and 24 laser cycles at 800 and
100 nm, respectively) and a Tconst = 26.5 fs (10 and 80 cycles, respectively) ﬂat top.
The charge state distributions in Fig. 1 were obtained by simulating an ensemble of 100
randomly rotated single atoms in the laser ﬁeld (the ﬁnal charge state varies because of
the diﬀerent orientations of the electronic cubic shell structure with respect to the laser
polarisation ex).

charge states appear at higher intensities. This is likely due to the incomplete screening
of the full nuclear charge by the other electrons in our model. In real experiments on Xe
in 800 nm laser light [32] also the saturation intensities for the lowest charge states obey
the Bethe rule so that our model obviously underestimates the screening. At 100 nm
(Fig. 1b), the maximum probabilities to ﬁnd successive charge states in our model Xe
atom lie closer together so that broader charge state distributions arise than at 800 nm.
In Fig. 2 focus-averaged charge state distributions at 800 nm are compared with the
experimental data in [32] for 200 fs laser pulses. The overall agreement is surprisingly
good. Note, however, that the experimental laser intensity had to be multiplied by a
factor 0.4 for matching our model results so that only good qualitative agreement can be
claimed. At 100 nm the energy of a photon is close to the ﬁrst ionisation potential of real
Xe. It would be not surprising if our semi-classical model breaks down at such short
wavelengths where ionisation becomes a single-photon process. Although the model
possesses eigenfrequencies, these have in general nothing to do with quantum mechanical
excitation or ionisation energies. Unfortunately, there are not yet experimental results
published on the ionisation of Xe at ≈ 100 nm in such intense laser ﬁelds. First results
for 98 nm, obtained at the DESY-FEL in Hamburg, Germany [33], suggests that our
model overestimates the saturation intensities. It should be emphasised, however, that
not the absolute values for threshold or saturation laser intensities are the main focus
of our studies but the relative diﬀerences between single atom and cluster ionisation.

3.2. Cluster results

Clusters consisting of Na = 54 model Xe atoms in the laser pulse of shape and duration
as described in the previous subsection were simulated. The initial cluster conﬁguration

was assembled by attaching randomly rotated single-atom electron conﬁgurations to
the ions. The ion positions Ri were taken from normalised Lennard-Jones cluster
calculations [34, 35] with each radial vector multiplied by 7.127 so that a Wigner-Seitz
radius rWS ≈ 4 was obtained. More details on the actual implementation of our cluster
model can be found in Ref. [36].

3.2.1. Ionisation mechanism In order to get a deeper insight into the cluster ionisation
dynamics it has proven useful to distinguish between three groups of electrons. First,

Small rare gas clusters in laser ﬁelds

there are those electrons that left their parent atom where they were situated at time
t = 0 when the cluster was still in its equilibrium, ground state conﬁguration with all
atoms in the cluster neutral. We consider an electron to contribute to this “parent
atom ionisation” if it is more than a Wigner-Seitz radius away from its parent atom.
Electrons in the second group are more than a Wigner-Seitz radius away from any ion
and thus deﬁne the averaged ion charge state. Finally, there are those electrons that
are far away from the entire cluster, contributing to outer ionisation.

In Fig. 3 the parent atom ionisation, the average charge state, and outer ionisation
are plotted vs time for the laser intensity I = ˆE2 = 6.4 × 10−3, corresponding to
2.2 × 1014 Wcm−2, and the two wavelengths λ = 800 and 100 nm. Common features in
both results are the fast removal of all active electrons from their parent atom and the
moderate outer ionisation (≈ 2 electrons per ion are removed from the entire cluster).
The removal of all six electrons from their parent atom might be surprising in view
of the fact that single, isolated atoms in the same ﬁeld loose not even three electrons
(see horizontal, green-dotted line in Fig. 3a). At lower laser intensities this discrepancy
between single atom ionisation and parent atom ionisation in clusters is even more
pronounced. In fact, we found that it is in general suﬃcient that the single, isolated
atom looses one electron to trigger complete parent atom ionisation in the cluster. It
should be noted, however, that this parent atom ionisation is not an observable because
electrons are indistinguishable, and other electrons might be trapped by the ion. The
average charge states (depending on the balance between ionisation and recombination)
are indeed signiﬁcantly lower in Fig. 3. Looking at the particle trajectories one infers
that the electrons hop from one ion to the other, undergoing inelastic collisions and
getting temporarily trapped. This is expected because a strongly coupled plasma of
electron density ne and Debye-length λD is formed whose plasma parameter 1/(neλ3
D)
is close to unity or even higher. Consequently, a Debye-sphere is populated by only a
few electrons, and the potential energy of the electrons is comparable to their kinetic
energy.

As mentioned previously, the average charge state Zavcs (indicated by “charge state”
in Fig. 3) was calculated geometrically by counting all electrons farther away than
rWS = 4 from any ion,

Zavcs =

where Θ is the step-function. This geometric concept is meaningful only when the
cluster has suﬃciently expanded so that it becomes unlikely that free electrons occupy
accidentally the test spheres of radius rWS around the ions. In fact, the cluster expansion
is the reason why the charge states appear to increase even after the end of the laser
pulse (indicated by the dashed vertical lines). Hence, only the asymptotic values of
the “charge state”-curves in Fig. 3 are the expected average charge states that would
be measured in a real experiment. These average charge states can be compared with
those charge states expected from the single, isolated atom calculations discussed in

Small rare gas clusters in laser ﬁelds

the previous subsection. The single atom results are included in Fig. 3 (horizontal,
green-dotted lines).

It is seen in Fig. 3 that,

for the particular laser intensity chosen, at 100 nm
the cluster ionisation is less eﬃcient than the single-atom ionisation. The “relative
ionisation,” that is, the average charge state in the cluster divided by the corresponding
single atom charge state, is shown in Fig. 4 as a function of the laser intensity. At
both laser wavelengths the relative ionisation in the cluster is particularly high when
the ﬁrst free electrons are generated. The ionisation rate for the very early electrons
in the cluster necessarily equals the one for isolated atoms since there is not yet the
potential from the other ions. However, as soon as these very early electrons leave, the
cluster charges up, leading to strong electric ﬁelds, especially at the cluster boundary,
that enhance further inner ionisation (“ionisation ignition” [17]). This is the reason for
the strong relative ionisation at intensities I < 6 × 10−4 for both wavelengths.

At higher laser intensities inner ionisation increases but the electrons are less
eﬃciently transported away from the cluster as a whole—especially at short wavelengths
because the quiver amplitude of the freed electrons is low then so that outer ionisation
can proceed through thermionic emission only. The electron temperature that is reached
is sensitive to the pulse duration. For the 42 fs-pulses and the laser intensities in the
present work the electron temperatures at 100 nm always remain below 1.7 atomic units.
During the cluster expansion, the electrons trapped by the cluster potential are cooled,
and recombination leads to only moderate ﬁnal charge states (the higher, transient
charge states should be experimentally accessible by measuring the emitted X-rays). As
a result, the relative ionisation at 100 nm drops below unity, that is, the atoms inside
the cluster ionise—on average—less eﬃciently than an isolated atom does. At 800 nm
and the same laser intensity relative ionisation remains above unity, mainly because
single atom ionisation is lower (see inset in Fig. 4) and the quiver energy suﬃces to
free the electrons from the cluster potential (see red, dotted outer ionisation-curve in
Fig. 4). Finally, at suﬃciently high laser intensities all electrons are removed from both
the cluster atoms and the isolated atom so that relative ionisation approaches unity.

In order to analyse the origin of the eﬃcient ionisation inside the cluster in more
detail it is useful to look at the external forces a bound electron experiences. This is
done in Fig. 5 for the two cases of an electron bound to an ion at the cluster boundary
and to an ion sitting in the cluster centre. The laser parameters were as in Fig. 3a.
The forces experienced by the electron are divided into a macro ﬁeld-part which is
made up by the laser and all electrons and ions that are outside a test sphere of radius
rWS = 4 around the ion of interest, and into a micro ﬁeld-part originating from electrons
passing through the test sphere within tth = 8 atomic time units. The threshold time
tth is introduced in order to estimate the importance of collisional ionisation of the type
e + Az+ −→ 2e + A(z+1)+ without allowing processes where the incoming electron is
captured to aﬀect the micro ﬁeld (like e + Az+ −→ e′ + Az+, for instance).

From Fig. 4 one infers that for the laser parameters used in Fig. 5, I = ˆE2 =
6.4×10−3 and λ = 800 nm, the average cluster ionisation is more eﬃcient than in isolated

atoms. Fig. 5b explains why. During the ﬁrst four laser cycles the test atom exclusively
“sees” the laser ﬁeld because ionisation is still very low so that there are no free electrons
around. Then the ﬁrst electrons are removed (see the parent atom ionisation in Fig. 5c)
and the macro ﬁeld signiﬁcantly exceeds the value one would expect from the laser ﬁeld
alone. Looking at the centre of mass in laser ﬁeld direction (Fig. 5a) of all electrons
inside the cluster, it is seen that these pronounced maxima in the macro ﬁeld occur at
times where most electrons are on the opposite side of the cluster so that the screening
of the positive cluster charge is low (see dashed lines to Fig. 5a). Half a laser cycle later,
when most electrons move to the side of the cluster where the test atom is located, the
macro ﬁeld drops dramatically. This clearly shows that a dynamical version of ionisation
ignition should be adopted, as proposed in Ref. [37]. As outer ionisation increases, the
maxima of the macro ﬁeld increase as well. This is due to the positive ion background
that pulls electrons from the cluster boundary into the interior, i.e., the “standard”
ionisation ignition mechanism. The force Fignition = Nouter/R2, where R is the radial
position of the test atom under consideration and

is the cluster charge, is included in plot (b). It is seen that the overall temporal evolution
of the macro ﬁeld is in good agreement with Fignition. Deviations, especially at late
times, are due to the inappropriate assumption of a homogeneously charged sphere for
an expanding cluster consisting of only 54 ions. The micro ﬁeld, caused by electrons
passing through the test sphere, does not contribute to a net increase of the charge state

Figure 5. Panels (b) and (e) illustrate the absolute values of the external forces
vs time, as seen by an electron bound to an ion at the cluster boundary and in the
cluster centre, respectively. The electric ﬁeld envelope of the laser pulse ( ˆE = 0.08,
λ = 800 nm, marked “pulse envelope”), the force exerted by all electrons and ions
outside the test sphere of radius rWS = 4 plus the force of the laser (“macro”), and the
force exerted by all electrons passing the test sphere within a time tth = 8 (“micro”)
are shown. In (b) the “ignition” force expected due to the positively charged cluster is
included as well. The centre of mass of all electrons inside the cluster Xcm is plotted
in (a) and (d). Parent atom ionisation and charge state of the cluster atom under

but only to ﬂuctuations (see Fig. 5c).

The test atom in the centre clearly experiences no ionisation ignition. Although
this atom looses all its “initial” electrons (see “parent”-curve in Fig. 5f) the overall
charge state remains low, in fact, lower than for an isolated atom in the same laser
ﬁeld. The micro ﬁeld is stronger in the cluster centre because the electron density is
higher there. However, the micro ﬁeld ﬂuctuations again do not increase the net charge
state on macroscopic time scales. Hence, collisional ionisation is not responsible for the
increased ionisation at 800 nm in Fig. 4, neither for atoms at the cluster boundary nor
for atoms in the centre.

From Fig. 4 one infers that at the shorter wave length λ = 100 nm and I = 6.4×10−3
the average charge state inside the cluster is slightly less than for the isolated atom. In
Fig. 6 the external forces experienced by a bound electron at the cluster boundary and in
the centre are presented for this case. Because of the higher laser frequency the centre of
mass-excursion is less pronounced so that collective electron dynamics inside the cluster
does not build up. Note that the centre of mass-excursion is actually less when the laser
is on than it is after the laser pulse, as it is expected for particles in a driven harmonic

oscillator when the driving frequency is higher than the eigenfrequency (i.e., the Mie
plasma frequency in our case). Outer ionisation during the laser pulse proceeds through
collisional heating (see section 3.2.2 below) so that the cluster charges up and the macro
ﬁeld again nicely follows Fignition in Fig. 6b. The ﬁnal charge state is maximal, i.e., 6,
but one has to keep in mind that also the isolated atom looses already ≈ 5 electrons in
this laser pulse. The charge state of the test ion in the cluster centre strongly ﬂuctuates
(see Fig. 6f), slightly rises after the laser pulse because of the previously mentioned
localisation eﬀect of the laser, but remains below the isolated atom result.

The fact that the charge states vary from high (at the cluster boundary) to low (in
the cluster centre) already suggests that the charge state distribution should be much
broader than in the single, isolated atom-case. This is conﬁrmed in Fig. 7 where the
charge state distributions for both laser wavelengths can be compared with each other
and the corresponding single, isolated atom-results. At the shorter wavelength the
average charge state in the cluster falls behind the isolated atom ionisation because the
electron temperatures reached are not high enough to yield suﬃcient outer ionisation.
As a result, the electron density inside the cluster potential remains high and, through
recombination, leads to a ﬁnally broad charge state distribution with a mean value lower
than in the single atom-case.

From Fig. 4 it can be inferred that in our model only for I < 0.002 the average
cluster ionisation is more eﬃcient than the isolated atom ionisation. It might be this
regime into which the enhanced ionisation measured in Xe clusters at 98 nm for laser
intensities up to 7 × 1013 Wcm−2 [16] falls into.
It would be interesting to verify
experimentally whether at higher laser intensities relative ionisation in small clusters

necessary for laser energy to be absorbed that the total current J = Z

collisions (i.e., inverse bremsstrahlung), electrons “colliding” with the cluster boundary

[14, 38], and electrons colliding with the cluster as a whole [39, 40, 41]. In the following
the relative importance of these mechanisms is analysed for our case of a small cluster
in a low- and high-frequency laser ﬁeld.

Fig. 8 shows the total absorbed energy (5) vs the peak ﬁeld strength of the laser.
Absorption is more eﬃcient for the short wavelength up to ˆE ≈ 0.13. This is because
inner ionisation is stronger for the high frequency laser ﬁeld so that both electron density
and average charge states are higher than at λ = 800 nm. However, the long wavelength-
result overtakes around ˆE ≈ 0.13. This can be attributed to the increasing importance
of electron-cluster and electron-cluster boundary collisions, as it is evidenced in the inset

is plotted. The “outer absorption” ∆Eoa measures the laser energy that is absorbed
by mechanisms diﬀerent from standard inverse bremsstrahlung through electron-ion
collisions because only electrons while they are farther away than rWS = 4 from any
ion contribute in (7). Since the maximum excursion of free electrons in a laser ﬁeld
is ∼ ˆE/ω2 it is expected that cluster boundary-eﬀects are more important at 800 nm.
In fact, even at the highest ﬁeld amplitude shown in the inset of Fig. 8 the excursion
ˆE/ω2 = 1.4 at 100 nm is still much smaller than the initial cluster radius 15.4 so that it
is clearly the thermal velocity that dominates the dynamics at 100 nm.

Also connected to the more eﬃcient absorption at 800 nm in stronger ﬁelds is the
fact that freed electrons are rescattered from the entire cluster while they oscillate with
large amplitude in the laser ﬁeld. At 100 nm instead the electrons leave the cluster
through thermionic emission, and the quiver amplitude in the laser ﬁeld is too small for
driving them back to the cluster. Consequently, the freed electrons drift away and are
thus lost for further energy absorption.

predominantly laser energy. The absorption rate averaged over a laser cycle T ,

Figure 9. Trajectory (a,c) and absorbed energy vs time (b,d) of the cluster electron
that contributes most to the total energy absorbed by the cluster at 800 (a,b) and
100 nm (c,d) for a laser ﬁeld amplitude ˆE = 0.07. Colour indicates whether the cycle-
averaged absorption rate is low (dark colours) or high (light colours). The “outer
absorption” contribution (dashed) is also included in plots (b) and (d). For the sake
of clarity, the electron trajectories in (a) and (c) are shown only for times t ∈ [0, 1450]
and t ∈ [400, 1000], respectively.

In the long wavelength case collisions with the cluster as a whole clearly dominate.
The biggest jump in the absorbed energy in Fig. 9b occurs between points A and B
where the electron crosses rapidly the cluster and large-angle electron-ion collisions are
obviously absent. Consequently, the fraction of “outer absorption” is particularly high
(see dashed curve in Fig. 9b). Note, that the time the electron takes to pass the cluster
from A to B is of the order of a laser period. Hence, the so-called impact approximation
(collision time ≪ laser period) does not apply, and eﬃcient energy absorption is possible
also in small angle scattering events.

The electron trajectory in the short wavelength case (Fig. 9c) is rather erratic due
to many individual electron-ion collisions. The electron temperature Te towards the
end of the laser pulse is ≈ 1.3 (corresponding to ≈ 35 eV) while the quiver energy in
the laser ﬁeld Up is only 5.9 × 10−3. Consequently, the motion of the electron inside
the cluster is dominated by the thermal velocity rather than by the laser ﬁeld. For the
long wavelength instead, the free electron excursion is already greater than the (initial)
cluster radius, the quiver energy Up is 0.38, and the ﬁnal electron temperature is of the
same order of magnitude, namely Te ≈ 0.7.

where h· · ·i indicates time-averaging over one laser cycle, Ne is the number of electrons

Calculating the collision frequency hνi is complicated by the fact that both ˙E and Ne
vary in time. The total cluster energy as a function of time at 800 and 100 nm is
shown in Fig. 10 for the case ˆE = 0.3 .

shortly after ionisation sets in at all, the behaviour is the opposite; then ˙E increases
during the pulse.

Because of these diﬃculties related to the time-dependent electron density inside

the cluster, an averaged single-electron absorption rate was introduced as

where Tconst
is the duration of the constant-intensity part of the trapezoidal laser
pulse. For the number of electrons, Ne = NaZavcs(T ) was chosen at 800 nm and
Ne = NaZavcs(T ) − Nouter(T ) at 100 nm because free electrons may be driven back to the
cluster in the former case while it is less likely in the latter. Taking the ﬁnal values for
Zavcs(T ) and Nouter(T ) may appear a too rough estimate. However, the average charge
states, ion densities, and electron temperatures to be inserted in the analytical collision
frequency formulas were also taken at time T so that consistency is maintained.

The result is shown in Fig. 11.

It is seen that at 800 nm none of the electron-
ion collision frequencies (12)–(15) agrees with the numerical result, especially around
ˆE ≈ 0.06 where both electron temperature and quiver energy are relatively low (0.6
and 0.28, respectively). If the collision frequency hνeii was as high as predicted by these
formulas, electron-ion collisions should clearly exceed the energy absorption by electron-
cluster boundary collisions. This, however, is not the case, as discussed in section 3.2.2.

In Ref. [24] formula (15) was found to overestimate collisional absorption which was
attributed to screening eﬀects not included in the derivation of (15). In fact, the Debye-

so that one would expect (15) to overestimate the collision frequency—which it

The numerical result at 100 nm is in good agreement with hν(s)

In Ref. [44] enhanced laser energy absorption was attributed to electrons scattering
on an eﬀective potential that changes from Coulombic with the full nuclear charge in
the interior to a Debye-screened potential with the actual charge state in the exterior.
Electrons with small impact parameter thus “see” a nuclear charge higher than the
actual charge state. This eﬀect, of course, is not speciﬁc to laser-cluster interaction but
is a general issue in plasma physics. It is automatically included—may it be important
or not—in our numerical calculations (at least as long as the number of actively treated
electrons is suﬃcient) while it is not incorporated in molecular dynamics simulations
dealing with rates for inner ionisation and eﬀective charge states only.

In our work, ionisation ignition was found to be the dominant ionisation mechanism
in clusters also at short wavelengths. This agrees with results presented in [24].
Ionisation ignition, upon relying on outer ionisation, is a ﬁnite-size eﬀect not considered
in [44]. It is the mechanism for outer ionisation that depends on the laser wavelength and
ranges from collective electron dynamics (long wavelength) to collisional absorption and
thermionic emission (short wavelength). Hence, inverse bremsstrahlung only indirectly,
via outer ionisation, leads to the generation of high charge states in clusters.

4. Conclusions

Results from numerical simulations of a semi-classical Xe54 model cluster in short and
intense laser pulses at 800 and 100 nm wavelength were presented and compared with
the corresponding single atom results. The inner-atomic dynamics was treated explicitly
so that no rates for ﬁeld ionisation, collisional ionisation, and recombination had to be
employed but all physical eﬀects, although classical ones only, were included exactly.

It was found that (dynamical) ionisation ignition is the by far dominating
mechanism behind enhanced ionisation of atoms inside clusters at both long and short
wavelength. The outer ionisation mechanism depends on the laser wavelength. At
long wavelengths, when the electron excursion is comparable to the cluster radius, laser
energy absorption proceeds mainly through electron-cluster (boundary) collisions while
at short wavelengths, where the electron dynamics is dominated by the thermal rather
than the quiver velocity, inverse bremsstrahlung prevails.

Collisional ionisation is insigniﬁcant.
The charge state distributions of the cluster ions are broader, ranging from the
highest charge state generally produced at the cluster boundary down to the lowest one
produced in the cluster centre. At short wavelengths the small electron quiver amplitude

Small rare gas clusters in laser ﬁelds

and the moderate temperatures reached in short pulses hamper outer ionisation. As
a result, after cluster expansion the ﬁnal, mean charge state may lag behind the
corresponding single atom result.

Recent work employing the “particle-in-cell” simulation technique [45] indicates
that at long wavelengths dynamical ionisation ignition (dubbed “polarisation enhanced
ionisation” there) and electron-cluster boundary collisions (called “laser dephasing
heating” in [45]) remain to be the dominant ionisation and absorption mechanisms
in big clusters of several 104 atoms as well.

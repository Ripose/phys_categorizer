Abstract

To determine the lifetimes of Eﬁmov states of negative two-atomic ions, the
problem of resonance scattering of a light particle on a pair of identical particles
has been considered. An analytic expression has been obtained for resonance
widths in the limit of forces of zero radius and low binding energies in pairs.
Calculations are compared with the numerical solution of the Faddeev integral
equations in a wide region of masses of the light particle. It is shown that the
widths of underthreshold resonances in the scattering amplitude obtained from
the integral equations with the Yamaguchi potential are well described by the
analytic expression, which allows this expression to be used in the mass region
inaccessible for numerical calculations. It has been concluded that the lifetime
of highly excited negative molecular ions with a binding energy close to the
threshold of disintegration is practically unlimited.

1 Introduction

Recent papers [1, 2, 3] have dealt with the exotic states of systems of neutral atoms
and an electron. These states are characterized by large (tens of angstroms) sizes and
demonstrate the eﬀects of three-body dynamics at low binding energies in pairs. In
particular, a direct analysis [1] of the Faddeev equations allowed us to determine the
eﬀective potential of interaction of two neutral atoms in the presence of an electron.
This potential is local in the range1

≪

min(κ−1)

(1)

(r0 is the range of two-body forces and κ is the wave number of a bound or virtual state
of a pair) and contains both the long-range components of the type 1/r2 typical for the
Eﬁmov eﬀect [4] and quasi-Coulomb terms of the type 1/r that essentially contribute to
the spectrum of negative two-atomic molecular ions with a small binding energy (real

or virtual) of an electron and an atom. Speciﬁcally, experimental data on the scattering
of an electron by a helium atom allow us to conclude on a possible existence of a bound
state of the system He−
2 even when there is no atom-atomic interaction [2]. Moreover,
the analysis of a system of three neutral atoms of alkali metals and an electron [3] shows
that the eﬀective interaction generated by the electron produce more than thousand
bound states. It has been assumed that similar systems can initiate clusters in highly
rareﬁed gases. However, that analysis is not complete for the atom- atomic interaction
with the binding energy higher than that of a three-particle system. In this case, the
system can decay into a molecule and a free electron, and bound states of the three-
particle system can transform into resonances with the lifetime determined by widths
of these resonances.

The present paper is devoted to the study of these widths in the framework of
the three-particle problem of scattering of a light particle on a bound pair of heavy
particles. Like in refs. [1, 2], we will consider the systems in which the lengths of two-
body scattering are much larger than the eﬀective ranges of two-body forces satisfying
the conditions of the Eﬁmov eﬀect:

1.

κr0 ≪
The binding energy of atoms is taken ﬁnite; whereas that in electron-atom pairs, zero
for simplifying, analytic computations. The threshold of rearrangement of the system
coincides with the threshold of disintegration and the above-mentioned spectrum of
three-particle systems [1, 2] is manifested as underthreshold Eﬁmov resonances. Reso-
nances of that sort, but under the excitation threshold, in a three-boson system were
considered in ref.[5] and equidistance was shown both for positions of resonances and
their widths on the logarithmic scale.

(2)

In this paper, we consider the case when the mass of one particle is considerably
smaller than the masses of two other particles. Here we are faced with almost classical
motion of heavy particles [1], which does not allow accurate numerical solution of the
Faddeev equations for the ratios of masses of an atom and an electron. Therefore, like
in ref.[1], numerical calculations are carried out for the ratios of masses not exceeding
1/100 in order to verify the analytic relation between the width and position of a
resonance that can be derived at extremely small eﬀective ranges of two-body forces.
It is demonstrated below that the analytic expression satisfactorily describes a highly
complicated mass dependence of the resonance widths, and thus it can be used to
estimate the resonance widths for realistic ratios of electron-atomic masses.

2 Integral equations

We consider a system of three spinless particles with masses mi, where the index
i = 1, 2, 3 denotes a particle, and with two-body potentials vi, whose index corresponds
to a particle absent in a two-particle subsystem. Identical particles 2 and 3 with masses
m2 = m3 = m interact via the potential v1 and form a bound state with the energy
κ2
ε1 =
1/2m23, where mij is the reduced mass of particles i and j. Particle 1 with
mass m1 interact with particles 2 and 3 via the potentials v3 and v2 (v2 = v3 = v),

−

respectively, which generate two-particle states (real or virtual) with an extremely low
binding energy (κ2 = κ3 = κ
0). The potentials vi (between particles j and k) were
taken to be the separable Yamaguchi potentials acting only in the s-wave:

vi(p, p′) =

(3)

The sign of the wave number κ deﬁnes either a bound (κ > 0) or a virtual state of a
pair. The parameter βi determines the range of forces in a pair. i. When βi ≫
κi, the
expansion of the eﬀective range in a pair i over the momentum of relative motion p
(p cotan(δi) = κi +ref f p2/2+...) gives ref f = 3/βi, which allows us to employ condition
βi. In what follows for brevity, we use the separable potential
(2) in the form κi ≪
given by projectors: vi =

.

Consider the scattering of particle 1 on a bound state of identical particles 2 and
3 with the energy of relative motion Ek = k2
0/2m1,23, lower than the energy of rear-
ε1. Here mi,jk is the reduced mass of particle i and a
rangement of the system ε2 −
pair (j,k). The momentum ki is always the momentum of relative motion of particle i
and pair (j,k), whereas the momentum pi refers to motion inside the pair (j,k). (If no
confusion, the indices are omitted.)

To write the system of Faddeev integral equations (see, e.g., [6]), we need an ex-
pression for the product of a two-body t-matrix in the 3-particle space and the free
(i))−1. The Hamiltonian of free motion of three

(j,k) and the Hamiltonian of relative motion in pair h0

is the total energy of a 3-particle system. For separable potentials, this product can
be represented in the form [7]

Note that the 2-particle t-matrix corresponding to a separable potential of the Yam-

iκi (on the physical sheet for a realistic bound state and on the unphysical
pi =
i(2βi + κi)
sheet for a virtual state). The distant pole on the unphysical sheet pi =
determines the range of two-body forces. The limit of zeroth range is achieved with
β tending to inﬁnity. In this limit, there remains one pole, and therefore it does not
matter, which two-body potential, either local or nonlocal, has generated it. Here we

It is to be noted that expression (12) has been derived without approximations and is a
convenient representation of the S-matrix. However, the Breit-Wigner parametrization,
separation of the resonance energy and width, imposes a certain constraint on widths.
They should be rather small so that an isolated resonance could be considered. The
true width of the resonance ˜Γ is determined not only by Γ, but also by the phase
of background scattering: ˜Γ = Γ cos2(δf ). Just for this reason the expression for Γ
contains plane waves rather than the wave functions of the state scattering in a certain
background potential. Below, we consider an expression for Γ that is always larger
than or equal to ˜Γ. Other speciﬁc properties of the S-matrix represented by (12) are
rather obvious and their discussion goes beyond the scope of this paper.

4 Wave function of the closed channel

We are interested in a series of resonances corresponding to the Eﬁmov eﬀect, i.e. when
conditions (2) hold valid and the spectrum of the Hamiltonian hv condenses around
zero. In this case the potential V gets much simpliﬁed, and for studying underthreshold
resonances it is suﬃcient to consider the S-part of the eﬀective potential at low energies,
2m2,13z), where solutions to the Schr¨odinger
or more precisely, at momenta k

equations slightly depend on energy. Under this auxiliary condition (β

The upper index 0 means that the eﬀective interaction is considered at z = 0. The
exchange potential V 0
ex describes the scattering of particle 2 (or 3) on a bound pair of
particles 1 and 3 (or 2) at the zeroth binding energy in the pair and is a ”classical”
potential generating Eﬁmov states. Solutions in the ﬁeld of that potential investigated
for a three-boson system [7], coincide with solutions in the ﬁeld of a local potential
(µ2 + 0.25)/2m2,13ρ2 (ρ is the Jacobi coordinate of relative motion of a
of the type
particle and a pair) with the coupling constant µ obeying a transcendental equation.
Below, we derive an equation of that sort for the total interaction potential. Note that
ex behaves like 1/k and admits a solution in the form ks. The potential
the potential V 0
V 0
tr is more complicated in form and admits solutions like that only in the region of
momenta where the quantity a in the denominator of the integrand of expression (14)
can be neglected. To verify this, we look for solutions to the Schr¨odinger equation with
the zeroth energy in the form Ψt = kiµ−5/2. To this end, we deﬁne the quantity Π:

ratio of contributions of the potential and kinetic energies to the Schr¨odinger equation.
Then, the Schr¨odinger equation is written in the form: Πex+2Πtr = 1. The contribution

and are determined by the value of µ1 from equation (15).

A simple analysis of eqs.(15) and (16) shows that µ2 exponentially tends to µ1 when
0, and the quantity µ1 in this limit is described by the expansion:

particle in Table 1. Due to the rapid convergence of µ2 to µ1, the second term in eq.

Thus, the wave function Ψt for a very light particle 1 in a large region (k
≫
2m2,13z)) of momenta is a linear combination of the functions k±iµ−5/2 with the
(
quantity µ = µ1. This momentum asymptotics is suﬃcient for computing the matrix
q
elements in the width Γ given by (11) since a dominant contribution to these integrals
κ1. The diﬃculty in normalizing the wave function
comes from the region of momenta
can be overcome in a simple manner. Our wave function describes the motion in the
eﬀective potential (17). Solutions in the ﬁeld of that potential are well known: Ψt(ρ)
∼
Kiµ/√ρ, they are expressed in terms of modiﬁed Bessel functions. The function Ψt can
be normalized, its Fourier transform and coeﬃcients of the leading asymptotic terms
k±iµ−5/2 can be obtained. This scheme is somewhat cumbersome but produces quite
a reasonable result that for a small mass of particle 1 coincides with the exact result.
The latter (at zeroth two-body forces) can be obtained more easily: the solution to the
integral equation with potential Vex can be derived in the whole region of momenta,
without setting z = 0, by the Mellin transformation, like it has been carried out in
[10, 11] in studying the properties of the Skornyakov-Ter-Martirosyan equation
refs.
[12]. In ref. [11], an approximate wave function has been found for a system of three
bosons with zeroth two-body forces which at zeroth binding energies in subsystems
becomes exact. The Lippmann–Schwinger equation with potential Vex throughout the
whole momentum region for the function ψ = k(k2

Therefore, equation (20) has also an analytic equation that can be derived by the Mellin
transformation. Here we present the ﬁnal result:

ψ(t) = A sin(µ ln(t + √1 + t2)),

that can be veriﬁed by a simple substitution of ψ into eq. (20). The constant µ again
obeys equation (15), and the constant A is deﬁned by normalization. The integral
equation (20) is solvable at all energies, however, the spectrum can be ﬁxed by imposing
constraints on the coeﬃcients of sin(µ ln k) and cos(µ ln k) at large k [10, 11]:

An arbitrary constant b determines the wave number κ(n)

for a level with number n:

t

sin(µ ln κt) = b cos(µ ln κt).

κ(n)
t = exp(πn/µ + arctan(b)/µ).

The spectrum thus found satisﬁes equation (18) and demonstrates the eﬀect of fall on
the center at large positive n, noted in ref.
[11], and the Eﬁmov eﬀect (logarithmic
condensation of levels around z = 0) at large negative n, later discovered by a diﬀerent
method [4].

Normalizing the wave function Ψt over the whole momentum space, we arrive at

the ﬁnal result for the wave function of the closed channel:

5 Widths of underthreshold resonances

As mentioned above, the width of a resonance ˜Γ depends on the phase of background
scattering and on Γ (11) that is deﬁned via matrix elements of the potential V12 that
connects the open and closed channels of elastic scattering. The background phase
depends on details of short-range two-body forces and cannot be considered (has no
limit) at the zeroth ranges of the forces, whereas the quantity Γ, being an upper limit
of the resonance width, can in this limit (β
) be calculated. In view of the equality

By using the wave function of the closed channel (21), we can compute this integral

a trivial angular integration and making t = k/κt dimensionless, we should make

Note remarkable properties of expressions (22) and (23). First, the relative width

the relative width of resonances exponentially decreases with the mass of particle 1.
To verify this, we write a limiting expression (m1/m2 ≪

where we go back to the notation Er since the diﬀerence between Et and Er is ex-
ponentially small. With expression (25), we can estimate lifetimes of strongly excited
negative ions of two-atomic molecules. Already for the proton–electron mass ratio and
certainly overestimated scale of the binding energy of subsystem (
) in 1 eV, the
lifetime of a resonance (1/˜Γ) is larger than 106 c and exceeds all possible relaxation
times in gases. More interesting are systems of a low energy of aﬃnity of an electron
and an atom. As mentioned in the Introduction, these systems can be negative ions of
molecules of alkali metals. Inserting the mass ratio for lithium into expression (25) we
obtain the lifetime 1040 c much greater than that of the Universe.

6 Numerical solutions

To demonstrate the validity of analytic computations, we numerically solve the system
of Faddeev integral equations (7) describing the scattering of particle 1 on a pair of
identical particles (2 and 3). Computations were performed by the scheme described
earlier [5] in which scattering can be considered as close as possible to the reaction
threshold. Our calculations do not require such maximal proximity since the coupling

10−15 MeV), and the binding energy in pair (2,3) ε1 equals

10−8 MeV). The rearrangement threshold diﬀers from the three-particle one

by 10−15 MeV (ε2 =

MeV. The masses of particles 2 and 3 are equal to the nucleon mass. The constant
β that determines the interaction range is taken the same for all two-body potentials
and equals 0.72 fm−1. Measurement units for the energy (MeV) and distances (fm) are
taken in accord with the Yamaguchi potential with parameters of the nuclear problem
(masses and interaction ranges) and characteristic potential energy in several ten MeV.
So, numerical calculations were based on small but ﬁnite interaction ranges of two-body
forces and binding energies in pairs. As the problem is completely speciﬁed by the ratio
of dimensional quantities, the results of calculations are also valid for atomic units. For
instance, conditions (2) for pairs

In Fig.1, we plot the scattering cross sections normalized to the unitary limit in S-
wave, σun = 4π/k2
0, for the mass ratio m2/m1 = 65. Since resonances condense to z=0,
the energy is plotted on the logarithmic scale. From Fig. 1 one can clearly observe the
equidistance of resonance positions. Unfortunately, even the maximum width in this
mass region of particle 1 (see Fig.2) remains very small and resonances are practically
straight lines.

In Table 2 we report positions of the ﬁrst six resonances, the ratio of the energy of
a preceding resonance to that with a given number, i.e., the quantity ηcalc, and relative
widths of resonances. For comparison, we present the values of µ1 and µ2, solutions
to equations (15) and (16), respectively: µ1 = 3.29589..., µ2 = 3.29654.... They
correspond to the values of η given by (18)): η(µ1) = 6.72823... and η(µ2) = 6.72608....
From the Table it is seen tat the energy ratio of the second to the third resonance

ﬁrst resonance is quite far from the threshold. The last column demonstrates the
relative widths to be independent of the number of a resonance. Starting from the

12

third resonance, changes occur in the fourth decimal place. So, Figure 1 and Table 2
conﬁrm the logarithmic equidistance of the positions of resonances and their widths
that manifests itself in the constant character of relative widths of resonances.

Figure 2: Relative widths of resonances. 1 is a numerical solution of the Faddeev
equations; 2, the analytic dependence. Explanations are given in the text.

To demonstrate the validity of expressions (22) and (23) in describing the ana-
lytic connection of widths of resonances and their positions at small ratios of masses
m1/m2, in Fig.2 we draw the relative widths obtained from numerical solutions to in-
tegral equations (a solid curve) and from expression (22) by substituting numerically
found values of resonance energies into it (a thin curve). Analytic dependence of the
resonance widths on masses follows the curve though it has a small phase shift. Note
some peculiarities of the dependence of widths on the mass of a light particle 1. First,
the width of a resonance is not a monotone function of its mass. Second, the maximum

13

of the widths of resonances exponentially decrease with the mass of particle 1 in accor-
dance with the estimation (24). In particular, for the range of mass changes (m2/m1),
from 15 to 100, shown in the Figure, the widths of resonances fall by three decimal
orders. A strong nonmonotone character of relative allows us to see the diﬀerence of
analytic estimations from the numerical results. If we estimate on the basis of sharp
local minima, then the observed phase shift for the minimum amount to 2 mass units
and monotonically decreases to 1.25 units in the region of the last minimum in the
Figure (m2/m1 ∼
95). Thus, the diﬀerence between analytic and numerical estimates
diminishes with mass m1.

7 Conclusion

So, we have estimated lifetimes of the Eﬁmov states of negative ions on the basis of
the scattering problem of a light particle (an electron) on a bound pair of two heavy
particles (molecules) under condition (2). This three-body problem allows one to derive
analytic expressions for widths and positions of resonances and at the same time to
verify them by a direct numerical solution of the Faddeev equations. For the ﬁrst
time, we have computed Eﬁmov resonances under the threshold of rearrangement of a
three-particle system.

Our consideration leads us to conclusion that lifetimes of a new class of molecular

states discussed in refs.

Electron exchange model potential: Application to positronium-helium scattering

P. K. Biswas and Sadhan K. Adhikari

Instituto de F´ısica Te´orica, Universidade Estadual Paulista, 01.405-900 S˜ao Paulo, S˜ao Paulo, Brazil

The formulation of a suitable nonlocal model potential for electron exchange is presented, checked

(February 2, 2008)

with electron-hydrogen and electron-helium scattering, and applied to the study of elastic and

inelastic scattering and ionization of ortho positronium (Ps) by helium. The elastic scattering and

the n = 2 excitations of Ps are investigated using a three-Ps-state close-coupling approximation.

The higher (n ≥ 3) excitations and ionization of Ps atom are treated in the framework of Born

approximation with present exchange. Calculations are reported of phase shifts, and elastic, Ps-

excitation, and total cross sections. The present target elastic total cross section agrees well with

experimental results at thermal to medium energies.

I. INTRODUCTION

The neutral Ps beam provides a great deal of advantage over charged projectiles as a probe to study the structure

of atoms, molecules and surface. Recently, there have been a great deal of interest in positronium- (Ps-) atom

scattering due to the improvement of Ps sources and Ps beams. Total scattering cross section of ortho Ps, which

has a larger lifetime than para Ps, have been measured for various targets [1,2] with an objective of understanding

the Ps-interaction dynamics with matter. Among all Ps-atom systems, the positronium-hydrogen (Ps-H) system is

the simplest and is of special theoretical interest [3]. However, due to experimental diﬃculties in obtaining nascent-

hydrogen atomic target there has been no experimental study of Ps-H scattering. The next most complicated Ps-atom

system is the positronium-helium (Ps-He) system in which there are good experiments on total cross section [1,2].

However, there are no theoretical studies [4–7] which can account for the measured total cross sections of ortho Ps-He

scattering . We address the present study towards an understanding of the measured total cross sections of Ps-He

scattering at low and medium energies using a suitably developed model exchange potential.

The interaction of neutral Ps atom with neutral atom or molecule is very much diﬀerent from that of charged

1

electron and positron with neutral targets [8]. In any Ps-atom scattering, the elastic and even-parity state transition

direct amplitudes to close-coupling approximation (CCA) are zero [3] due to internal charge and mass symmetry of

Ps. In addition, the adiabatic polarization potential is also zero and the electron-exchange mechanism appears as

the main driving force at low energies apart from the correction expected from polarization/Van der Waals force [3].

This was not the case for electron-impact scattering where both the direct and exchange interactions play their roles

in determining the solution of the scattering equations. The Ps-atom system allows the possibility for studying the

eﬀect of exchange in an environment characteristically diﬀerent from that of the electron-atom system due to the

composite nature of Ps. Recently, in addition to total cross section at medium to high energies [1], thermalization of

Ps in gaseous He has also been measured [2]. However, it is of serious concern that dynamical calculations with the

reliable and widely used static-exchange model with usual antisymmetrization [4–6] fail severely yielding very large

total cross sections compared to the measured data [1,2], specially at low energies. The experiments of Refs. [1,2]

are consistent among themselves. They collectively suggest a lowering trend of cross sections from a peak at 20 eV

towards lower energies. This trend is missing from all previous published calculations. Moreover, due to the large

error bar on the measured cross section at 10 eV of Ref. [1] and absence of data near Ps excitation and ionization

thresholds, it is not clear whether the cross section has a minimum or not in this energy region. The present study

also addresses this feature from a theoretical point of view.

The proper inclusion of exchange eﬀect is a major technical obstacle in performing dynamical calculations in complex

systems [9]. The eﬀect of electron exchange is usually accounted for in a quantum dynamical calculation through

the antisymmerization of the wave function which introduces nonorthogonal functions to these calculational schemes

including the usual static-exchange model. These antisymmetrization schemes with nonorthogonality defect lead to

overcompleteness in the Hilbert space and associated theoretical and numerical diﬃculties in the CCA and related

formalisms. Moreover, when short-range (exchange) correlations are important, the CCA converges very slowly [10].

Several discussions and prescriptions to remedy this defect have appeared in the literature in connection with electron

impact scattering [9]. This problem has been overcome to some extent in electron-impact scattering using diﬀerent

methodologies − with essentially exact (variational) treatment of exchange in simpler cases, with eﬀective correlation

and suitable model potentials [11] for larger targets. Gross deviations of previous calculations [4–6] on Ps-He scattering

2

from measurements at low energies [2] could be a consequence of the nonorthogonality defect and/or the inadequacy

of the correlation eﬀect in exchange-dominated Ps-impact scattering, specially at low energies.

To address this problem we choose to remove the nonorthogonality from the exchange kernel of the momentum-space

CCA equation by using a suitable model potential. The additional simplicity of the present exchange potential makes

it very attractive for performing dynamical calculation in many-electron systems. The exchange model is shown to

be readily applicable to electron- and Ps-impact scattering problems. In order to test the generality and reliability of

the exchange model we apply it to electron-hydrogen (e−-H) and electron-helium (e−-He) scattering, in addition to

Ps-He scattering.

We present a theoretical study of ortho-Ps-He scattering employing a three-Ps-state CCA scheme in momentum

space where the usual nonorthogonal exchange kernel arrising from antisymmetrization is replaced by the present

model exchange potentials. The helium atom is always assumed to be in its initial ground state and the Ps(1s),

Ps(2s), and Ps(2p) states are included in the coupled-channel calculation. Being the lightest atom, Ps is more

vulnerable to excitation than the inert helium atom in Ps-He scattering. Also, the Ps-excitation thresholds are the

lowest ones in this system. Hence, the present three-Ps-state model seems to be a reasonable one to describe Ps-He

scattering from low to medium energies. The cross sections for higher discrete and continuum excitations of Ps atom

are calculated in the framework of the ﬁrst Born approximation including present exchange. These Born cross sections

are added to the above three-Ps-state cross sections to predict the target elastic total cross section.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we present the model exchange potential for electron-impact scattering

and numerical results for electron scattering by H and He. In Sec. III we present the model exchange potential for

Ps-impact scattering and numerical results for Ps scattering by He. Finally, in Sec. IV we present a summary of our

ﬁndings.

II. EXCHANGE POTENTIAL FOR ELECTRON-IMPACT SCATTERING

Although, we are mostly interested in developing an exchange potential for Ps-impact scattering in this work, ﬁrst

we illustrate and check our model in the case of electron-atom scattering where the exchange potential is well under

control. We develop the present exchange model for e−-H elastic scattering using H(1s) orbital and ﬁnally extend it

3

to the case of inelastic scattering by a complex target described by a Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function. The exchange

potentials are derived from the following exchange transition amplitude

(2.1)

where the position vector of the incident (target) electron is r2 (r1). Here φ is the wave function of H, ki (kf ) is

the initial (ﬁnal) momentum of the incident electron, and r12 = r1 − r2. Amplitude (2.1) is the leading term of the

exchange amplitude at large energies [12] and also the usual starting point for deriving model exchange potentials

[11]. To remove the nonorthogonality defect we seek an exchange potential of the form

g(kf , ki) ∼

∗
drφ

(r)U (r, ki, kf )φ(r),

Z

where the form of U is to be determined. We consider the integration over the coordinate of the ﬁnal projectile

electron r1 of Eq. (2.1) below. Using φ(r) = π−1/2α3/2 exp(−αr), taking Fourier transformation, and performing the

integration over r1, we obtain

Any average value prescription for (kf − q)2 in Eq. (2.3) will reduce Eq. (2.1) to form (2.2). Then, in the model

exchange potential, the ﬁnal and initial state wave functions will be expressed in terms of same coordinates. Recalling

that internal kinetic energy of H (q2/2) is given by α2/2 in atomic units, we take average of q2 as α2, and set

(kf − q)2 ≈ (k2

f + α2), where the average value of the scalar product is assumed to be zero. After taking an inverse

Fourier transformation in Eq.(2.3), the ﬁnal model exchange potential takes the following simple form

potential for transition from state ν to ν′ becomes

Similar model potentials were derived by Ochkur and also by Rudge [12]. Ochkur’s result is obtained by setting

α = 0 in the prefactor of Eq. (2.5). Rudge’s result corresponds to taking the prefactor (k2

= (kf − iα)−2.

The model exchange potential (2.5) has the following desirable physical properties. This potential is the strongest at

the lowest possible energy (kf = 0) for the weakest bound atomic orbital (αν → 0). Hence, the eﬀect of exchange is

more pronounced at low energies for the loosely bound orbitals.

For a general HF wave function, ψν (r1, ..., rj , ..., rN ) = A[

The model potential (2.7) with prefactor Dκκ′j of Eq. (2.8) is not time-reversal symmetric. However, if we perform

the integration over the initial projectile electron r2 in Eq. (2.1) ﬁrst, and carry on a similar procedure, we obtain

exchange potential (2.7) with Dκκ′j = (k2

κ′j), where ακ′j refer to the ﬁnal state. These two possibilities suggest

the following symmetric prefactor

Dκκ′j = [(k2

in Eq. (2.7). The two possibilities (2.8) and (2.9) corresponding to two averaging At high energies, the model exchange

potential (2.7) with diﬀerent averaging prescriptions lead to the Oppenheimer exchange potential [13]. However, at

low energies the cross section is sensitive to the averaging procedure and the value of the parameter α in prefactors

(2.8) or (2.9). This sensitivity may well be exploited to tune the parameter α of a particular averaging procedure in

order to obtain a better ﬁt with experiment at low energies.

Although, the model potential (2.7) is derived for the ground state of the atomic target, it is straightforward to see

that the same result is also valid for target excitations in the ﬁnal state using a similar averaging prescription. Hence

model potential (2.7) is equally valid for both elastic and inelastic scattering by the target.

We have used the exchange potential (2.7) in e−-H and e−-He scattering and calculated the elastic cross sections.

We also demonstrate the eﬀect of diﬀerent averaging procedures − symmetric and nonsymmetric, and the variation

of the parameter α whenever relevant. In the case of e−-H scattering we exhibit the results for elastic cross section in

a coupled H(1s,2s,2p) model using the above exchange potential in the symmetric form (2.9) with the exact value of

the parameter α. For e−-He scattering we present results for elastic cross section in the static-exchange model using

the symmetric form (2.9). In the case of He we present a variation of the parameter so as to obtain a better ﬁt with

experiment.

In Fig. 1 we present results for e−-H scattering using Eqs. (2.7) and (2.9), where we exhibit the exchange Born,

static-exchange, and H(1s,2s,2p) cross sections without variation of the parameter α. In this ﬁgure we compare the

low-energy cross sections with experimental results [14] and the calculations by Temkin and Lamkin [10]. At medium

energies the results are compared with essentially converged calculation of Callaway [15]. We also plot the total

ﬁrst Born cross section with Oppenheimer exchange [13]. At low energies the present H(1s,2s,2p) cross sections are

improvement over the present static-exchange cross sections. At higher energies they are essentially identical and

only the static-exchange results are shown. At large energies, as expected, the present cross sections tend to the total

ﬁrst exchange-Born (Born+Oppenheimer exchange) results. Both at low and medium energies the agreement of the

present cross sections with the results of other workers is encouraging. We veriﬁed that both the exchange Born,

static-exchange cross sections are sensitive to the variation of the parameter α in the prefactor (2.9). We demonstrate

the eﬀect of such variation at low energies in the study of e−-He scattering where it seems more relevant.

6

In Fig. 2 we plot the present static-exchange cross section of electron-helium scattering for model exchange potential

given by Eqs. (2.7) and (2.9) with the HF helium wave function of Ref. [16]. In this case we present results for ﬁrst

exchange-Born and static-exchange elastic cross sections with the exact parameters α’s. Here we also present results

for static-exchange cross sections with modiﬁed value for the parameters α (< q2 >= (0.4α)2) in the prefactor (2.9)

for both κ and κ′ corresponding to initial and ﬁnal states, respectively. (The parameters in the helium wave function

under the integral in Eq. (2.7) are left unchanged as should be.) The results are compared with experimental results

and the ﬁve-state [He(1s,21s,23s,21p,23p)] CCA calculation of Burke et al [18] using model exchange potential.

The present static-exchange cross-sections agree reasonably with experiment [17] at medium to high energies. The

variation of the parameter α in this case has led to good agreement with experiment and the CCA calculation of Burke

et al [18] at lower energies. For obtaining a better agreement with experiment the eﬀect of excitation and polarization

of the target should be taken into account. This could be done by considering a coupled-channel calculation with

helium excitations as in the electron-hydrogen scattering considered above. With this reliability achieved in the e−-H

and e−-He systems we extend this exchange model to Ps impact cases.

III. EXCHANGE POTENTIAL FOR POSITRONIUM-IMPACT SCATTERING

A. Formulation

Here, we ﬁrst we develop the present exchange model potential for Ps-H elastic scattering using H(1s) orbital and

ﬁnally extend it to inelastic Ps scattering by a many-body target described by a HF wave function. We start with

the following exchange transition amplitude [11]

where the position vector of the electron (positron) of Ps is r2 (x). Here sj = (x + rj)/2, tj = (x − rj), j = 1, 2,

χ (φ) is the wave function of Ps (H). As in the previous section, to remove the nonorthogonality defect we seek an

exchange potential of the form

where U is to be determined. We consider the integration over the coordinate of the ﬁnal projectile electron r1 of Eq.

(3.1) below. Using φ(r) = π−1/2α3/2 exp(−αr) and χ(t) = π−1/2β3/2 exp(−βt), taking Fourier transformation, the

integral I over r1 is given by

(p2 + α2)2 .

Again we employ an average value prescription for (kf /2 − p + q)2 in Eq. (3.3) which will reduce Eq. (3.1) to form

(3.2). Recalling that the internal kinetic energies of H (represented by p2/2m; m = 1) and Ps (q2/2m; m = 1/2)

are given by α2/2 and β2 in atomic units, we take the averages of p2 and q2 as α2 and β2, respectively, and set

(kf /2 − p + q)2 ≈ (k2

f /4 + α2 + β2) in Eq. (3.3), where the average values of the scalar products are assumed to

be zero. After taking an inverse Fourier transformation in Eq.(3.3) and transforming the set of variables x, r1, r2 to

t2, r1, r2, where the Jacobian is unity, the ﬁnal model exchange potential becomes

and all Ps excitation channels. This exchange potential could be considered to be a generalization of Rudge-type

exchange Born amplitude [12] for electron-impact scattering to more complex situations. For a general HF orbital

(2.6), summing over appropriate target electrons j and allowing for inelastic Ps channels, the (target-elastic) model

where µ ≡ nl (µ′ ≡ n′l′) are the initial (ﬁnal) Ps quantum numbers, φκj (r) is the κth function of the jth electron

for the atomic ground state, and βn′ corresponds to the ﬁnal inelastic Ps state, for which the derivation of the model

potential is similar and leads to the same result (3.4) or (3.5). For Ps ionization, the constant β2

n′ , which corresponds

to the ﬁnal Ps-state binding energy, is taken as 0 in Eq. (3.5).

As noted in Sec. II, the exchange potential given by Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) is not time-reversal symmetric. However,

if one performs in Eq. (3.1) the integration over the coordinate of the initial projectile electron r2 ﬁrst with a similar

average-value prescription as above one will obtain exchange potential (3.5) with Dκκ′j = [k2

(3.7)

Both choices (3.6) and (3.7) lead to good numerical results. At high energies the results are independent of this choice.

At low energies they are sensitive to the choice and the value of the parameter α in Eqs. (3.6) and (3.7). In this work

we shall present only results of choice (3.6) with the original and modiﬁed value of the parameter α.

With the present prescription, the Ps-impact exchange potential is written in the form of product of projectile and

target form factors, as the direct potential above. This simple form of the amplitudes facilitates numerical calculations.

(3.8)

B. Numerical Application to Ps-He Scattering

In the case of target-elastic Ps-He scattering, electron exchange between the incident Ps and target He is only possible

between like spins. Consequently, only the spin-triplet state of the electrons undergoing exchange is possible. We

9

deﬁne appropriately symmetrized spin-triplet “Born” amplitudes, B, via Bµ′µ(kf , ki) = BD,µ′µ(kf , ki)−BE,µ′µ(kf , ki).

The appropriately symmetrized scattering amplitude f satisﬁes the following momentum-space Lippmann-Schwinger

scattering integral equation [6]

(3.9)

where ǫµ′′ is the total energy of the Ps and He states in the intermediate state µ′′ and E is the total energy of the

system. The diﬀerential cross section is deﬁned by (dσ/dΩ)µ′,µ = (k′/k)|fµ′µ(k′, k)|2.

We performed static-exchange [with µ′′ = Ps(1s) in Eq.

(3.9)] and three-Ps-state [with µ′′ = Ps(1s,2s,2p) in

Eq. (3.9)] calculations using exact wave functions for Ps and HF atomic orbitals for He [16]. After a partial-wave

projection, Eq. (3.9) was solved by the method of matrix inversion. Maximum number of partial waves included in

the calculation was 10. Contribution of higher partial waves to cross sections was included by corresponding Born

terms. To predict the cross sections at medium energies, we also calculated the discrete excitation (3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p,

4d, 4f, 5p, 5d, 5f, 6p) and ionization cross sections of Ps in the ﬁrst Born approximation keeping the target frozen to

its initial ground state using the present exchange model.

In Fig. 3 we plot the present target-elastic total cross section [Ps(1s,2s,2p) three-Ps-state cross section plus target-

elastic total Born cross sections for n ≥ 3 Ps-excitations and Ps-ionization]. The experimental total Ps-He cross

sections of two diﬀerent groups − recent low-energy cross section of Ref. [2] and medium- to high-energy cross

sections of Ref. [1] − are also plotted. For comparison we also plot the static-exchange and 22-coupled-pseudo-state

(without exchange) cross sections of Refs. [6] and [7], respectively. The measured Ps-impact total cross section of Ref.

[1] has a peak near 20 eV and a lowering trend below this energy, and the recent measurement around 1 eV of Ref.

[2] is consistent with this trend. However, due to large error bar of the measurement of Ref. [1] at their lowest energy

(10 eV) and due to inadequate data in this energy region, it is not clear from experiment whether the total cross

section has a minimum near the Ps excitation threshold or not. This question is addressed in the present theoretical

investigation. At energies below the Ps-excitation thresholds, the elastic cross section is found to be a monotonically

decreasing function of energy, as is usually found in many similar scattering problems. In the narrow energy band

10

between 5.1 to 6.8 eV, all the Ps-inelastic channels open up causing a sharp increase of the total cross section, as can

be seen in Fig. 7, resulting in a minimum of total cross section near the Ps-excitation threshold. With this feature of

the cross section, the present calculation bridges the two diﬀerent experimental ﬁndings and points out a minimum

in total cross section near the Ps(2s) threshold. This feature is also noticed in the unpublished theoretical work of

Peach [19]. While the 22-coupled-pseudo-state calculation [7], which includes the Ps excitation and ionization eﬀects

through pseudo states, completely denies this trend; the static-exchange cross sections [4–6] are too large to match

the measurement near Ps(2s) threshold.

So far we have parametrized the model potential from a physical argument and presented results with it. In Eq.

(3.5) ακj’s are parameters of HF orbitals. In Fig. 3 we also exhibit the consequence of a small variation of ακj in the

prefactor (k2

f /4 + α2

κj + β2

n′ )−1 of Eq. (3.5). The full line, providing an overall better agreement with experiment, is

obtained by varying parameters ακj’s in the prefactor (3.6), which is taken as

Dκκ′j = [k2

f /4 + (0.88ακj)2 + β2
n′ ]

(3.10)

in both the static-exchange and three-Ps-state calculations. Unless speciﬁcally mentioned, all results presented here

are calculated with this modiﬁed prefactor. The above reduction in the average value of < p2 > has led to a better

agreement with experiment.

Next we present an account of phase shifts and angle-integrated partial cross sections with modiﬁed prefactor

(3.10). The present static-exchange and three-Ps-state elastic scattering phase shifts for diﬀerent partial waves below

the lowest excitation threshold are shown in Figs. 4 (S wave) and 5 (P and D waves). The present phase shifts

are diﬀerent from those of previous calculations [4–6] as is expected from the cross-section pattern. However, for

comparison we show the phase shifts of the recent work by Sarkar and Ghosh [6] in Figs. 4 and 5. At these energies

the S-wave phase shifts alone control the elastic cross section. The present low-energy elastic S-wave phase shifts are

expected to be more reasonable to those of the previous calculations as from Fig. 3 we ﬁnd that the present cross

sections are in better agreement with experiment.

In Fig. 6 we plot the present low-energy elastic cross sections for static-exchange and three-Ps-state calculations. We

compare these cross sections with the recent sophisticated low-energy experimental cross section of Ref. [2] measured

using time-resolved Doppler Broadening Spectroscopy and the previous static-exchange cross sections of Refs. [4–6].

11

Here, just to have a feeling, we also plot the present static-exchange cross section calculated with the exact parameter

α in the prefactor. The present three-Ps-state cross sections are signiﬁcantly smaller than previous theoretical cross

sections and are in close agreement with experiment. The present exchange Born cross sections are also smaller

than those of previous calculations. For example, Sarkar and Ghosh [6] obtained the ﬁrst Born elastic cross sections

131.9πa2

0 and 12.5πa2

0 at 0.068 eV and 1 eV, compared to the present ﬁrst Born elastic cross sections 8.8πa2

0 and

0, respectively. The present three-Ps-state cross sections are smaller than the static-exchange cross sections and

are well within the experimental error bar. However, in the present calculation we have neglected long-range van der

Waals interaction. The eﬀect of this interaction has been shown [5] to increase the zero-energy cross section by as

much as 30%, while around 1 eV its eﬀect is to increase the cross section by about 3% only. Hence, the inclusion of

this interaction is expected to further improve the agreement with experiment at low energies.

In Fig. 7 we exhibit the diﬀerent angle-integrated partial cross sections for the three-Ps-state calculation. Here

we show the Ps(1s) and Ps(2s+2p) cross sections from the three-Ps-state calculation and Ps(n ≥ 3) excitation and

Ps-ionization cross sections using the present total ﬁrst Born model. At medium energies the Ps-ionization cross

sections are the largest and dominates the trend of the total cross section of Fig. 3. This feature has also been

observed by Campbell et al [7] in Ps-H scattering.

The angle-integrated partial cross sections are of crucial importance and are presented in Table I. These partial

cross sections are calculated with the modiﬁed prefactor (3.10) and leads to total cross section in better agreement

with experiment. These cross sections should be considered to be the most realistic results of the present model study

except near zero energy where van der Waals force might play a crucial role, which is not taken into account. In

13

addition to the three-Ps-state cross sections we also present our ﬁrst Born and static-exchange results in Table I with

modiﬁed prefactor (3.10). For comparison we also show the static-exchange results of Sarkar and Ghosh [6]. The

present elastic Born cross sections are much smaller than those of Ref. [6]. The present three-Ps-state elastic cross

sections are smaller than the static-exchange cross sections, which demonstrates the eﬀect of large polarizability of

Ps.

IV. SUMMARY

We have presented simple model exchange potentials for electron- and Ps-impact scattering suitable for performing

dynamical calculation in many-electron systems and checked it in electron scattering from H and He and applied it

to Ps scattering from He. The present static-exchange and three-Ps-state coupled-channel cross sections of electron-

impact scattering are in agreement with other existing results [10,14,15,17,18]. We have performed static-exchange

and three-Ps-state calculations for Ps-He scattering at low and medium energies. To exhibit the usefulness of the

present exchange at medium energies, higher excitations and ionization of Ps are calculated using the ﬁrst Born model

with present exchange. The present target-elastic total cross sections agree well with experiment [1,2] both at low

and medium energies.

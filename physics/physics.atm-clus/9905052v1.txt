Abstract. The quantum dynamical evolution of atomic and molecular aggregates,
from their compact to their fragmented states, is parametrized by a single collective
radial parameter. Treating all the remaining particle coordinates in d dimensions
democratically, as a set of angles orthogonal to this collective radius or by equivalent
variables, by-passes all independent-particle approximations. The invariance of the
total kinetic energy under arbitrary d-dimensional transformations which preserve
the radial parameter gives rise to novel quantum numbers and ladder operators
interconnecting its eigenstates at each value of the radial parameter.
We develop the systematics and technology of this approach,

introducing the
relevant mathematics tutorially, by analogy to the familiar theory of angular
momentum in three dimensions. The angular basis functions so obtained are treated
in a manifestly coordinate-free manner, thus serving as a ﬂexible generalized basis for
carrying out detailed studies of wave function evolution in multi-particle systems.

Geometry and symmetries of multi-particle systems

1. Introduction

The challenge for atomic and molecular theory to deal with progressively larger
aggregates of electrons and nuclei suggests treating them in terms of global parameters,
in contrast to the usual independent-particle approach [1, 2, 3, 4]. Globally one may
represent each conﬁguration of N particles by a single vector R identiﬁed by 3(N
1)
internal coordinates with origin at its centre of mass. R’s modulus R thus represents
the aggregate’s overall size, while its direction ˆR speciﬁes its geometry, i.e., the layout
of the constituents’ relative locations and orientations. Quantum dynamics controls
then wave functions of R that emphasize ˆR’s evolution from a compact to a fragmented
structure as R grows.

−

In the centre-of-mass frame, the reduced two-body Coulomb problem separates
in spherical coordinates. Extending the system by adding more particles, the kinetic
energy retains its three-dimensional spherical symmetry as a subset of its symmetry
in higher dimensions. This remark suggests concentrating the search for appropriate
coordinates on the kinetic energy. Hyperspherical coordinates prove suitable for our
task, by combining the symmetries of particles’ kinetic energies into a uniﬁed internal
kinetic energy of the whole aggregate. This procedure ensures an accurate description
in the compact limit where the aggregate’s kinetic energy predominates.

−

In a ﬁrst step, hyperspherical coordinates separate R’s modulus R from its direction
ˆR, the latter being represented by parameters analogous to the polar coordinates of
physical space. The polar-coordinate symmetries, embodied in the familiar formalism
of angular momentum theory, extend thus automatically to R’s (3N
3)-dimensional
treatment. Our proposed perspective of hyperspherical coordinates as extending the
three-dimensional spherical symmetry to higher dimensions aﬀords advantages far
beyond the technical aspect of providing a convenient coordinate system. Separating
the single hyper-radius R from a large number of hyper-angles, and focusing on the
symmetries under transformations of these hyper-angles, allows one to handle most
of the many degrees of freedom in a multi-particle system analytically. For example,
explicit calculation of angular integrals may be avoided in much the same way as
in ordinary three-dimensional angular momentum theory by replacing such overlaps
with coupling coeﬃcients derived directly from the symmetry under (d-dimensional)
rotations. A second example employs the coordinate-independent representation of d-
dimensional transformations [5, 6, 7, 8] to construct complete sets of hyperspherical
harmonics, higher-dimensional analogues of spherical harmonics, without solving partial
diﬀerential equations in any speciﬁc coordinate system. This application proceeds
much as in three dimensions, where all harmonics may be built recursively from a
single function once the appropriate “laddering” operators are identiﬁed. The resulting
ﬂexibility in choosing centre-of-mass coordinate frames is crucial in the case of a multi-
particle system with its evolving structure, because no single reference frame proves
appropriate throughout the entire evolution.

The hyper-radius R serves as the “evolution parameter” of wave functions

The general theory of hyperspherical coordinates (originally conceived for three-
body scattering problems) dates to the ﬁfties [9, 10, 11, 12]. Since then, hyperspherical
methods have been fruitfully applied to a wide variety of many-body phenomena ranging
from quantum chemistry to particle physics, as illustrated e.g. by several contributions
in [13].

Delves [14, 15] pioneered the method’s application to shell-model calculations of
nuclei. To this day, the hyperspherical approach remains a standard tool in nuclear
physics, notably in the study of halo nuclei [16], three-nucleon systems [17], as well
as large nuclei
(For reviews on
hyperspherical methods in the context of nuclear physics, see e.g. [20, 21, 22].)

[18] and even sub-nuclear (quark) structure [19].

In the seemingly very diﬀerent context of reactive scattering in quantum chemistry,
the participating atoms’ coordinates have typically been cast in hyperspherical form,
their motions being governed by eﬀective potentials [23, 24, 25]. Besides molecular
reactions [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] the hyperspherical approach applies also to molecular
structure [33] and quantum phase eﬀects in chemical reactions [34, 35].

These applications required more general and mathematical investigations on the
structure and properties of hyperspherical functions [36, 37, 38, 39], with a special focus
on additional quantum-physical features such as anti-symmetrization in fermion systems
[40, 41, 42] and internal structures of an N-particle system in three-dimensional space
[43].

Applications of hyperspherical methods to doubly excited states of two-electron
systems in atomic physics [1, 2] resulted in a complete classiﬁcation scheme for these
states [44, 45, 46, 47], based on systematic investigations of the wave functions’ structure
[48, 49, 50, 51]. Connections with molecular structure [52, 53] arising from these
classiﬁcations have more recently aﬀorded extending the hyperspherical approach to

Geometry and symmetries of multi-particle systems

systems with several heavy particles besides electrons (i.e., to molecules) [54].
In
three-body Coulomb problems, hyperspherical methods have become computationally
competitive through the “hyperspherical close-coupling method” [55], and more recently
in the form of “diabatic-by-sector” numerical methods [56]. Another extension
employing over-complete basis sets aﬀorded determining accurately resonances of very
high-lying doubly excited states close to the threshold for double ionization [57, 58].
Thus, the hyperspherical approach covers essentially the entire energy range from the
ground state, through the “Wannier-region” around threshold for full disintegration,
to energies high above this regime (see e.g. [59]). Besides the two-electron atom and
generic three-body Coulomb systems, studies have focused on doubly excited many-
electron atoms [60, 61], with several forays into atoms with three [62, 63, 64, 65, 66]
or even more excited electrons [67, 68, 69]. Moreover, the treatment of highly excited
atoms in external ﬁelds [70, 71] has extended the list of successful applications of the
hyperspherical method in yet another direction. Currently, physically adapted Sturmian
basis sets promise further advances in broader contexts [72]. Reviews on various aspects
of the hyperspherical approach in atomic physics may be found, e.g., in [73, 74, 75]. See
also [76] for a discussion of the reliability of the hyperspherical adiabatic method.

Our equation (1.2) implies going a step further, extending hyperspherical
coordinates to all constituents, electrons and nuclei, governed by their Coulomb
interactions. Equation (1.2) thus represents an exact Schr¨odinger equation, and all
calculations proceeding from (1.2) will be completely ab initio [3, 4, 77, 78, 79].

ignoring,

We intend in this essay to encompass all types of applications of hyperspherical
coordinates. Thus the deﬁnition (1.1) need only extend over the dynamically relevant
variables for a given problem,
for instance, the coordinates of electrons
belonging to closed shells. In this context note already the interplay between “motions”
on widely diﬀerent (time) scales: At each ﬁxed hyper-radius R, a “geometrical” structure
emerges resulting from the faster motion in the hyper-angular coordinates; the emerging
structure then evolves on a diﬀerent scale as R increases. This theme—central to
the hyperspherical method—serves as a guideline throughout the present paper. As
a qualitative illustration, consider the following hyperspherical description of a water
molecule H2O, a system consisting of ten electrons, two protons, and an oxygen nucleus.
In a preliminary step towards ab initio construction of this molecule, a hyperspherical
procedure would ﬁll ﬁrst the closed inner shells of the constituent atomic cores, in this
case only the K shell of O6+. Recognizing the vast diﬀerence between electronic and
nuclear motion, the electronic motion is “parametrized” by the cores’ arrangement. For
each core arrangement, the electronic motion is analyzed to ﬁnd the most favourable
electron distribution. This analysis proceeds in a hyperspherical representation of the
valence electrons as a single entity consisting at the outset of a group of six electrons
joined by two single electrons, as suggested by the core charges. Analogous procedures
for the construction and transformation of such “Jacobi trees” will be outlined in
section 2. The particular arrangement of the cores should manifest itself in the hyper-
radius Re associated with the set of valence electrons alone, once the latter are attached

Geometry and symmetries of multi-particle systems

5

{

RN , αN , θN }

to the cores. The angular coordinates specifying the geometrical arrangement of the
valence electrons depend parametrically on their own hyper-radius Re, which is in turn
parametrized by the “size” and “shape” of the nuclei (or cores). The latter is itself
described by a set of hyperspherical coordinates,
, to be introduced in
section 2, thereby completing the hierarchy of geometrical structures governed by the
interplay of hyper-radial and angular motions, and of electronic and atomic motions.
The dynamical evolution of the “shape” characterizing the cores’ arrangement should
minimize the energy of the whole molecule for the correct molecular geometry, while the
hyper-angles characterizing the distribution of valence electrons should indicate that
four of them are essentially attached to the O6+ core, with the remaining two pairs
forming the bonds holding the molecule together. Without attempting to carry out
the computational details of this description, the present paper introduces techniques
required for its implementation. Namely, we intend to focus on the universal (i.e.
coordinate-independent) aspects of hyperspherical coordinates and harmonics, to be
implemented upon identifying the suitable Jacobi coordinates of a speciﬁc system.

Returning to equation (1.2), we note that features of Ψ are discrete, owing to the
ﬁnite extent of hyperspherical surfaces, being accordingly represented by appropriate
quantum numbers and nodal structures rather than by coordinates, much as they are in
three dimensions; their interpretation will, however, require not only adequate mastery
of high-dimensional geometry, a subject of this paper, but also of the dynamical interplay
between light electrons and heavy nuclei. Equation (1.2) should serve to calculate
energy eigenfunctions for any atom, molecule or analogous aggregate. Its solution for
“collision complexes” formed by colliding molecules will provide the relevant scattering
matrix directly, as indicated in section 5, by-passing the calculation and study of energy
surfaces.

The structure of (1.2) parallels that of the atomic H equation, being actually its
extension to multi-particle systems. Its ﬁrst term represents the kinetic energy of the
hyper-radial motions, its second term that of the hyper-angular motions, and its last
term the potential energy, which—being the sum of Coulomb interactions among all of
the aggregate’s particle pairs—scales as R−1. The evolution of Ψ’s angular part as a
function of R, foreign to hydrogen, stems from the non-zero value of the commutator
[∆ ˆR, Z( ˆR)].

Equation (1.2) preserves instead hydrogen’s invariance under coordinate rotations
under rotations of ˆR about
by securing invariance of the kinetic energy operator ∆ ˆR/2
the centre of mass, by mass-weighting the coordinates as described in the following. Sets
of mutually independent eigenfunctions of ∆ ˆR’s, analogues of spherical harmonics called
“hyperspherical harmonics”, serve to expand (1.2) into a system of coupled ordinary
diﬀerential equations in the variable R, analogous to those of atomic physics. The
“eﬀective atomic number” operator Z( ˆR) turns then into a matrix with rows and
columns labelled by hyperspherical quantum numbers.

Simple examples of such harmonics in d dimensions have been formulated [80, 81],
the corresponding eigenvalues of ∆ ˆR having long been known. These examples, to be

Geometry and symmetries of multi-particle systems

discussed in section 3, provide solutions for the second-order eigenvalue problem of ∆ ˆR
in speciﬁc coordinate systems for d dimensions. Developing an appropriate systematics
of multi-variable hyperspherical harmonics suited to each system (and thus coordinate-
independent) constitutes, however, a major objective, to be approached in section 4 on
the basis of symmetries alone.

The importance of such a description cannot be overemphasized. The distribution
of R’s multi-dimensional direction ˆR should represent speciﬁc features of each system
ﬂexibly, near and far from its centre of mass as well as at intermediate ranges. At
short ranges, where the system is compact, this distribution should minimize the
centrifugal eﬀect represented by the eigenvalue of ∆ ˆR in (1.2). At large ranges, where the
system fragments, ˆR’s distribution should represent alternative, mutually orthogonal,
fragmentation channels. Both of these contrasting representations can be achieved in
terms of ﬂexible “Jacobi (or centre-of-mass) coordinate” sets, interrelated by algebraic
transformations, the subject of section 2.2.

The present paper develops implications of the quantum discovery that pairs
of variables conjugate in Hamiltonian dynamics are actually related by Fourier
transformations, whereby dynamics reduces to kinematics, more generally to geometry
(whence stems this paper’s title). Expanding equation (1.2) in hyperspherical harmonics
reﬂects but one aspect of these implications; Jacobi coordinates provide a second aspect.
2), with
integer λ. Thus, the system of coupled equations resulting from expansion of (1.2)
into hyperspherical harmonics parametrized (in part) by the hyper-angular momentum
λ is formally inﬁnite, owing to the inﬁnite range of λ, and seems accordingly impractical.
Key circumstances reduce, however, its size generally to a modest level:

The angular Laplacian’s eigenvalue in d dimensions reads λ(λ + d

−

a) For low-lying channels, the centrifugal term of (1.2), whose numerator rises as λ2,
quenches the amplitude of Ψ’s components with large values of λ to negligible levels
at small hyper-radius R.

b) Correspondingly, its Coulomb term (prevailing at large R) has eigenvalues similarly
spread over many orders of magnitude, its lowest one approximating the lowest
dissociation threshold for molecules or ionization threshold for single atoms and its
highest one approaching the threshold for full disintegration of the system.

c) The range of λ values of practical relevance depends thus critically on the energy
range relevant to each step of evolution. So do accordingly the dimensions of the
corresponding set of hyperspherical harmonics and of the relevant Z( ˆR) matrix.

Early calculations [77, 78, 79] have accordingly shown the range of λ values relevant
at each value of R to be modest, thus aﬀording ready numerical integration of (1.2).
Each inﬁnitesimal “dR” step of this integration generates an inﬁnitesimal rotation of the
Ψ(R; ˆR) wave function by [Z( ˆR)/R]dR in the ˆR space. The broad range of applications
envisaged in the present article rests on the power of its underlying recursive procedures
and on the characteristic aptitude of computer technologies to apply such procedures
step by step.

minimizing its moment of inertia about a symmetry axis. Analogous features should be

The wide range of symmetry applications,

resulting from invariance under
coordinate rotations and thus relevant for our application to quantum mechanics, is
currently covered appropriately by [82]. Terminology drawn from [7, 8] will appear in

2. Linear coordinate transformations in higher dimensions

Physical-space expansions into spherical harmonics hinge on their geometrical and
kinematical behaviour under coordinate rotations, labelled as the “angular-momentum
theory”. Their extension to larger coordinate sets aﬀords ﬂexibility for displaying
geometrical and kinematical features of multi-particle systems, at the price of extending
and elaborating each system’s treatment.

Whereas, in a three-dimensional prototype, rotations about the x-axis, i.e. in the
yz-plane, are not independent of rotations about the z-axis because of involving the z-
axis itself, in a multi-dimensional setting rotations about diﬀerent axes are independent
insofar as they operate in separate planes. Each elementary coordinate rotation is then
properly identiﬁed, in multi-dimensional settings, as occurring within (or parallel to)
the plane through a given pair of coordinate axes, rather than as preserving a single

example of the helium atom, consisting of three particles and described in terms of

The ﬁrst two of these expressions are plainly analogues of single-particle’s lz; the
interpretation of the last one—intermixing two particles’ coordinates—remains obscure
at this point. Note also that ﬁnite rotations are familiarly represented by exponential

internal coordinates are partitioned typically in three-dimensional sub-sets of single-

boundless. These three-dimensional coordinate sub-sets may also include angles θi =

To establish contact with the relevant mathematical theory of Lie groups and Lie
algebras [7, 8, 82], we observe that the set of linear inﬁnitesimal rotation operators
in d dimensions considered in this section forms the “special orthogonal group” of
transformations, designated as SO(d); the term “special” referring to exclusion of
dilations. Quantum mechanics extends this group to include the analogous complex
transformations forming the unitary group SU(d) of transformations that preserve the
complex Hermitian form
k instead of its real quadratic analogue. The full
unitary group U(d) results from adding multiplication with a complex phase exp(iα)
to its “special” version SU(d). The real part of the Hermitian form is preserved by
orthogonal transformations, its imaginary part by “symplectic” transformations that
preserve bilinear forms odd under permutations of their elements, such as the spin

2.1. Symmetry under rotation reversal; ladder operators

Reversal of a rotation’s direction is represented, e.g. in (2.1), by switching the sign of
the coordinate y or of the imaginary unit, thereby reversing the sign of the operators lz
and of their eigenvalues m. Symmetry under this reversal has been high-lighted in [7, 8]
by replacing pairs of coordinate labels (xi, yi) with pairs (xi, x−i), thus replacing yi in
(2.6). The index i runs thus over (1, 2 . . . , ℓ), being complemented by an x0 for spaces
of odd dimension d. Spherical coordinates include then ℓ azimuths ϕi, with odd parity
under rotation reversal, and ℓ polar angles θi, changed by this reversal into π

θi.

Here we preserve the familiar notation with coordinate pairs (xi, yi), pointing
out that the rotation reversal
is often complemented with the reﬂection through
the coordinate plane xz, which automatically reverses the sign of yi. The resulting
combination reverses the handedness (“chirality”) of each particle’s space coordinates
(x, y, z).

Note ﬁrst that, whereas the physical space operators (lx, ly) change by unity the
mi, mj}
eigenvalues m of lz, each of the N-particle operators (2.6) shifts the eigenvalues
of an operator pair
ily) act as “ladder” operators
. Whereas combinations (lx ±
raising or lowering the eigenvalues m of lz by unity, combinations of four among these
N-particle analogues (2.6) raise or lower eigenvalue pairs simultaneously. The resulting
rather elaborate classiﬁcation of operators became a central feature of the algebraic
treatment [7, 8]; we shall follow a more direct approach.

Hi, Hj}

Recall how the ladder operators of physical space, lx ±

ily, emerge as non-Hermitian
combinations of the Hermitian pair (lx, ly). Similarly, non-Hermitian “raising” and
“lowering” conjugate operators, designated here generically as (a†, a), respectively,
may be viewed as combinations of two pairs of Hermitian operators, a† + a and
i(a†
a), symmetric and antisymmetric, respectively. Recall also that the physical-
space Hermitian operators (lx, ly) are antisymmetric and symmetric, respectively, under
reﬂection through the xz-plane, according to standard “Condon-Shortley” conventions.
A heuristic approach to constructing ladder operators might thus start by identifying
combinations of operators (2.6) that are symmetric and antisymmetric, without
resorting to Lie-algebra procedures.

acting on mi and mj in the way familiar from SO(3), is not generic for SO(d). Instead
its structure is due to the well-known feature of orthogonal groups that SO(4) factors
into a pair of SO(3) sub-groups. A related example familiar in physics is aﬀorded by the
factoring of the (proper) Lorentz group SO(3, 1) into SU(2)
SU(2), with “spinors” of
opposite chirality [82, Chapter 11]. Reference [7] derives these results algebraically.

perform an analogous role for the much larger and multi-faceted sets of hyperspherical
harmonics. To this end one may combine the operators (2.6) ﬁrst into pairs symmetric

The heuristically introduced operators of the type (2.7b) fail to act correctly as ladder

2.2. Jacobi coordinates

Mass-weighting of coordinates has served in section 1 to deﬁne the hyper-radius R
conveniently, contrasting it with the angular coordinates represented by ˆR. Analogous
devices serve to weight appropriately the components of ˆR pertaining to particles with
diﬀerent masses Mi, making them homogeneous, and thus removing the Laplacian ∆ ˆR’s

explicit dependence on single-particle masses. To this end, generic sets of “Jacobi
coordinates” have been introduced long ago [12], replacing the single-particle ri by
vectors ξi with the mass-weighted dimension mass1/2-length.

Alternative sets of Jacobi coordinates occur, reﬂecting alternative groupings of
particles, properly weighted by the mass of each group through linear transformations
with dimensionless coeﬃcients. These sets are in turn interconnected by dimensionless
linear transformations, each of whose steps amounts to rotation in one plane. Handling
of Jacobi coordinates becomes thus laborious even though each step be elementary.

Jacobi coordinates prove essential by identifying each fragmentation channel
through a particular Jacobi tree separating at its base into two branches corresponding
to the relevant fragments. One thus displays the evolution of each particle-aggregate
toward a speciﬁc fragmentation channel by the structure of relevant tree-shaped Jacobi
coordinates. The label “Jacobi tree” reﬂects the evolution of a multi-particle system
fragmenting (i.e., “branching out”) from a trunk into separate systems.
[Developing a
multi-particle wave function toward one among its alternative fragmentations presents
instead an upside-down view of that tree.]

We show below a few simple prototype Jacobi trees, whose upper endings
correspond to single-particle labels. Permutation of two particles is represented by
rotating (a) about its trunk. Changing of (b) into (c), often referred to as transplanting
of branch 2, corresponds to the prototype transformation of hyperspherical harmonics.
Generic transformations resolve into sequences of permutations and transplantations.
Tree (e) is often called “canonical”. Multi-particle systems are represented by
correspondingly articulated trees.

The Jacobi trees just introduced serve to characterize multi-particle systems by
their hierarchy of composition, i.e., by indicating the order in which particles are joined
to form sub-complexes of the entire aggregate. The labels thus refer to particle indices.
A similar concept re-appears in a further context: Analogous trees illustrate coordinate
systems and their transformations, their branches labelling appropriate angles in ˆR’s

applications of the present approach, dealing with very few particles, even though
necessarily underlying the treatment of any multi-particle system. Each transformation
of hyperspherical harmonics resolves accordingly into a transformation from one to
another set of Jacobi coordinates and a transformation of the corresponding harmonics.
Note the “hierarchical” aspect of Jacobi-tree construction, which adds particles
sequentially, contrasting with the “democratic” view of the multi-particle coordinates
leading to the quadratic increase of the number of (2.6) operators as a function of the
particle number N.

Once again: Each step dealing with Jacobi coordinates is elementary, but the
number and combinations of diﬀerent steps are large, a characteristic generally
encountered in computer operations requiring adequate strategy and planning. Such
operations may properly articulate into successive phases. We anticipate, for example
in dealing with molecules, to build ﬁrst each atom’s inner shells independently, by
Cavagnero’s procedure [67, 68, 69], combining later the resulting atomic ions with the
residual atomic electrons.

Similarly, the following sections present ﬁrst alternative combinations of three
particles, lying in a plane with their centre of mass, into alternative pairs of mutually
independent collective coordinates ξ, followed by transformations among these pairs.
Combinations of larger particle sets into further ξ’s will be dealt with next, utilizing
analogous procedures recursively. Even more extensive procedures will hinge on
experience in treating large multi-particle aggregates.

2.2.1. A three-particle prototype The positions ri, i = 1, 2, 3, of a three-particle set
identify a plane where their centre of mass also lies. These positions are represented
by these co-planar vectors, but their internal kinematics involves only two independent
Jacobi coordinate vectors, ξ, with 3(N

1) = 6 degrees of freedom.

The standard procedure for constructing Jacobi coordinate vectors considers ﬁrst
the positions of two among these particles, 1 and 2 here, with masses M1 and M2 and
positions r1 and r2. These input data combine into a ﬁrst Jacobi vector weighted by
the square root of the pair’s “reduced mass” M12 = M1M2/(M1 + M2), namely,

−

The next step combines the ﬁrst pair, with mass M1 + M2 and centre of mass
position r12, with the third particle lying at r3. This step is performed in accordance
with (2.8) yielding the second Jacobi vector,

Similarly, restructuring of any “Jacobi tree” diagram, which represents a speciﬁc
sequence of particle combinations forming an aggregate, resolves into sequences of
rotations within a plane, analogous to that represented by (2.12).
vector-pair
Such restructurings have been discussed amply in [20] under the name of “timber
transformations”, the word “timber” being suggested by association with “Jacobi tree”.
The simple underlying principle, stated in that reference, lies in the feasibility to resolve
any rotation in multi-dimensional spaces into a sequence of plane rotations, a feature
familiar for the three-dimensional rotations of physical space. Appendix B exempliﬁes
this procedure.

Transformations between diﬀerent Jacobi trees prove highly relevant to our subject
of atomic and molecular few-particle systems for the following reason. The Coulomb
coeﬃcient Z( ˆR) results familiarly from contributions proportional to the reciprocal
1)/2 particle pairs. Flexible sets of Jacobi coordinates
distances between the N(N
aﬀord treating each of these distances as a single coordinate, to be combined with
others, thus avoiding the familiar need to expand each term of Z( ˆR) into a multipole
series. Thereby determining Coulomb interaction matrix elements reduces to calculating

3. Sample hyperspherical harmonics

The familiar spherical harmonics, Ylm(θ, ϕ), serve as tensorial base sets for (2l + 1)-
dimensional transformations induced by rotations of the physical-space coordinates.
In multi-dimensional contexts analogous base sets of hyperspherical harmonics serve
the same purpose. The name “harmonics” identiﬁes them as eigenfunctions of the

To understand the term d

2 in this eigenvalue formula, note ﬁrst that it reduces
to unity for d = 3 yielding the familiar eigenvalue l(l + 1) of the squared orbital angular
momentum. The unit in this expression corresponds to the single angular coordinate θ
that accompanies the angle ϕ in polar coordinates. Its contribution to the eigenvalue,
namely l, corresponds to the “zero-point energy”, “hl”, of a unit-mass particle oscillating
along the θ coordinate in the centrifugal ﬁeld generated by its rotation along ϕ with

quantum number l. The occurrence of d

magnetic quantum number m labelled as a “weight” and l in the role of “highest weight”.
Extending this parametrization to d-dimensional spaces requires us to describe sets of
hyperspherical harmonics Yλµ( ˆR), where λ replaces the “highest weight” l, the vector

This extension provides a main tool for the quantum mechanics of multi-particle
systems, as indicated in section 1 anticipating the relevance of the hyperspherical
harmonics and of their treatment in [77, 80]. Recall that the position vector R of
an N-particle set (in its centre of mass frame) has d = 3(N
1) dimensions. The wave
functions Ψ(R) of such a system, envisaged in section 1, are conveniently expanded in
hyperspherical harmonics in analogy to expansions in spherical harmonics [77]. Their
Schr¨odinger equation reduces similarly to a system of coupled ordinary diﬀerential
equations in the “hyper-radius” R.

−

The symbol for hyperspherical harmonics, Yλµ( ˆR), replaces the index l of spherical
harmonics by the index λ corresponding to the eigenvalue
1)-
dimensional angular Laplacian ∆ ˆR. This index also stands for the degree of the
homogeneous “harmonic” polynomial products RλYλµ( ˆR). The second index µ replaces
the index m of spherical harmonics with a corresponding set of d
2 parameters (the

dimension of ˆR less 1) that identify a speciﬁc harmonic of degree λ.

Expanding wave functions of a multi-dimensional R utilizes “complete orthogonal
sets” of hyperspherical harmonics. Completeness is achieved by extending the range
of λ adequately. Only a ﬁnite set of harmonics proves, however, relevant at any ﬁnite
value of R, higher values being eﬀectively excluded by a generalized centrifugal potential
at small R, as noted in section 1. [This potential, involving the λ parameter, includes
contributions from derivatives of variables corresponding to the α coordinate in (2.4) and
representing the quantum mechanical resistance of particles to compression by boundary
conditions.] As R increases more and more hyperspherical harmonics start contributing
to the relevant wave functions, requiring adequate frame transformations to reﬂect the
appropriate fragmentation channels, as outlined in section 5. Orthogonality requires

The set of harmonics (3.3), with a given value of λ, consists of a number of elements
w, the dimensionality of the relevant space. This number depends on the number of
alternative partitions of λ into (l1, l2, n) consistent with the relation λ = l1 + l2 + 2n,
and on the alternative 2li + 1 values of each mi. The prototype example of λ = 2 leads
to the partitions: (2, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0), (0, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0) and, in turn, to 5 + 5 + 1 + 9 = 20
harmonics. Diﬀerent partitions of λ yield hyperspherical harmonics with alternative
nodal patterns, reﬂecting alternative sharing of rotational kinetic energy in diﬀerent
modes. The algebraic determination of w is discussed in [7, 8, 82] and outlined in
section 4. The general expression [8] for w reduces in the present case (d = 6) to
(λ + 3)(λ + 2)2(λ + 1)/12.

Geometry and symmetries of multi-particle systems

Notice how the eigenvalue parameters (l1, l2, 2n) play the role of “weights” in (3.3),
each of them amounting to the “highest weight” for a sub-group of the rotation group
SO(d = 6), thus contributing to the “highest weight” λ = l1 + l2 + 2n of the SO(6)
harmonics (3.3). The symmetry under the sign reﬂection (m
m) (cf. section 2.1)
manifests itself in these harmonics not only through the symmetry of each factor Ylimi,
but also through the parity of the polynomial Pn, which is even or odd for even or odd
values of the “pseudo weight” n, combined with interchange of its upper indices. Note
also how n substitutes for the weight m3, an eigenvalue of the third operator (2.5),
which fails to commute with the operators l2
i even though commuting with (∂/∂ϕ1) and
(∂/∂ϕ2).

The harmonics (3.3) provide, of course, a basis for expanding correlated electron
in the form Ψ(R; ˆR) of section 1, with the direction
wave functions in helium,

α, θ1, ϕ1, θ2, ϕ2}
then desired features of the relevant eigenfunction Ψ(R; ˆR). This representation does,
however, emphasize single-electron aspects of the state through its parameters (li, mi)
rather than through the global features anticipated in section 1.

Note, on the other hand, that the procedure presented above to construct the
harmonics (3.3) applies recursively to (N > 3)-particle systems, as should the previous
comments, with the following qualiﬁcations: Extending (3.3) to N > 3 particles involves
N

Jacobi polynomials in cos 2αj with the full set of 3N

these polynomials, replacing the single-particle (li + 1/2) of (3.3), reﬂect however the
total angular momenta, L or J , of paired particle sub-sets as determined by relevant
hierarchical additions of single-particle momenta [68]. Note also how the structure of the
harmonics (3.3), and of their higher-dimensional analogues, exploits the commutability
of the base operators
and of their corresponding sub-group structure, with a
notable exception: The angle α as deﬁned in (2.4) does not coincide with the arctan of

The particular sub-group structure of (3.3) stresses the single-particle features of each
system, contrary to section 1’s emphasis. We turn now accordingly to [80]’s alternative
construction of harmonics that emphasizes diﬀerent elements, dealing with d = 3N

unspeciﬁed coordinates besides a spherical harmonic Ylm(θ, ϕ), without reference to

Its partial
derivative reduces Ylm’s polynomial dependence on cos θ by one degree, thus removing
one parallel-line node, its ﬁrst factor adds instead a meridian-line node implied by the
vanishing of its real or imaginary parts. To trace out this eﬀect more explicitly, recast

The ﬁrst term on the right of this expression, when applied to the function Ylm(θ, ϕ)
with a non-negative m value, raises its m index by one unit through the combined action
of its two factors: The ﬁrst factor, x + iy = r sin θeiϕ combines with the same factor
within Ylm, thus raising by one unit the number of its meridian-line nodes as well as the
exponent of its sinm θ factor. Its second factor (∂/∂z), equivalent here to r−1(∂/∂ cos θ),
reduces by one unit the degree of Ylm’s polynomial dependence on cos θ, thus suppressing
one of its parallel-line nodes. The second term on the right of the operator’s expression
cancels instead the function Ylm(θ, ϕ) by setting it to zero.]

(cid:19)

A direct analogue of the successive action of lx + ily operators on Pl(cos θ) would
apply to the Gegenbauer polynomial (3.4) a sequence of corresponding operators acting
on components of ˆR. A novel aspect emerges, however, at this point, since ˆR has
several components orthogonal to ˆR′ acted upon by alternative operators in alternative
sequences. Such alternative sequences will occur in section 4, whereas reference [80]
avoids them by treating all ˆR components uniformly, besides their physical-space sub-
set ˆR

To this end, reference [80] follows the frequent practice of complementing an initial
two-dimensional component (cos ϕ or sin ϕ) by multiplying it with the factor sin θ and
adding a further ˆR component cos θ, whereby ˆR retains its unit magnitude. Iterating

In conclusion, the present construction of hyperspherical harmonics has followed
two approaches: (i) Solving the (angular) Laplace equation by separation of variables,
leading to the harmonics (3.3) and extensible to higher dimensions; (ii) Constructing
the harmonics (3.7) by a sequence of Gegenbauer polynomial factors (also separating
variables), complemented by factors (sin θj)µj+1, analogues of the (sin θ)m of spherical
harmonics and similarly generated by applying inﬁnitesimal operators sin θ(∂/∂ cos θ)
to the invariant Gegenbauer harmonic (3.4).

These approaches diﬀer in their coordinates as well as in their dynamical
implications: No physical speciﬁcation of the ˆR components θj has occurred in the
approach (ii). Approach (i) has relied on the single-particle coordinates and on their
interrelations introduced in (3.2), namely

4. Classiﬁcation and construction of hyperspherical harmonics

Section 3 introduced hyperspherical harmonics for two diﬀerent sets of coordinates,
relying on single-particle features to a diﬀerent extent. Both sets of hyperspherical
harmonics are characterized as “harmonic polynomials”, i.e., as eigenfunctions of the
angular Laplacian, obtained directly by separation of variables. Their construction thus
ties each of these harmonics to a particular choice of coordinates.

By contrast, sections 1 and 2 repeatedly stressed the need for ﬂexibility in
the choice of coordinates to describe the evolution of an atomic or molecular
complex from its compact to its fragmented states. Having familiarized the reader
with properties of hyperspherical harmonics in the preceding section, we now
introduce harmonics essentially frame-independent, thus by-passing extensive frame
transformations necessary for harmonics tied to a particular set of coordinates. We
describe here a procedure to generate complete sets of harmonics independent of the
choice of coordinates. Consequently, the same set of harmonics serves throughout the
entire evolution process, frame transformations reducing to the task of expressing the
harmonics in whichever coordinate system appears appropriate at any given stage of the
evolution, without change to the basic structure of the functions themselves.

The key feature enabling a deﬁnition of harmonics without separation of variables
in the Laplacian’s eigenfunction equation rests on identifying the Laplacian’s symmetry

Geometry and symmetries of multi-particle systems

22

under rotations in d dimensions. Section 2 described these transformations in terms of
ﬁrst order inﬁnitesimal rotation operators. We will now construct functions based on
Hi}
-operators and on the corresponding ladder operators only. Because these functions
{
will possess the underlying symmetry of the Laplacian, they are “harmonics” a fortiori.
The present task amounts to extending the classiﬁcation of spherical harmonics by
their label pair (l, m) to multi-dimensional systems, in accordance with procedures to
construct such harmonics. To this end recall that:

a) The l label of Ylm identiﬁes both an eigenvalue of the second-order angular Laplacian

l2 and the range 0

m

l of its second label.

≤ |

| ≤

b) The label m itself is an eigenvalue of the ﬁrst-order operator lz.
c) Alternative equivalent sets of harmonics correspond to alternative orientations of

the z-axis.

d) Complete sets of spherical harmonics Ylm(θ, ϕ) emerge by operating on the
ily,
invariant harmonic Pl(cos θ) with the conjugate pair of ladder operators lx ±
ily alone on the “highest weight”
or alternatively operating with the lowering lx −
harmonic Yll(θ, ϕ).

Corresponding remarks on hyperspherical harmonics outline here this section’s
development:

a) We have seen how the multi-dimensional label λ performs l’s role in identifying
eigenvalues of the relevant multi-dimensional angular Laplacian. Alternative
partitions of λ’s value will similarly delimit the ranges of m’s analogues.

A sample set of harmonics emerging in this framework will be displayed at the end of
section 4.3.

Quantum numbers mi, eigenvalues of Hi operator sub-sets, serve to classify
“(quasi)-invariants” of multi-particle systems. Such is the Jz component of the invariant
angular momentum J of isolated systems. Two mi components pertain to a molecule
rotating about a symmetry axis of lower inertia in its “body-frame”. Three mi’s
characterize atomic Rydberg states, one of them pertaining to their inner core, one
to the Rydberg electron and one to their vector sum. A plethora of such mi’s might
pertain to a turbulent ﬂuid.

In the absence of quasi-invariants, other than the total J ’s, the single label
m of (3.7) may suﬃce, but a number (
ℓ) of additional mi’s, judiciously chosen
≤
with reference to the system’s structure, helps classifying harmonics Yλµ( ˆR), and the
corresponding multi-particle wave functions.

Geometrical elements of classiﬁcation also emerge from the nodal patterns of
harmonics, as noted in section 3. The Laplacian’s separability into coordinates xi,
stressed at the outset of section 3.1, aﬀords real solutions of the several resulting one-
dimensional equations in xi (with appropriate boundary or periodic conditions) to be
characterized by ni nodes, yielding altogether
i ni nodes, a total basically equal to
the eigenvalue λ. Real hyperspherical harmonics with equal λ diﬀer then by their λ’s
partitions into the relevant ni.

(4.4)

When Eηs is cast as a ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operator, (4.4) determines that particular
“highest weight” harmonic.

Operating on each of these “highest weight” harmonics with successions of
“lowering” E−ηs operators generates complete sets of hyperspherical harmonics, as
detailed in the following sections.

4.1. Operations on the mi parameters
The mi quantum numbers, eigenvalues of the operators Hi, belong in the ˆhi “space”,
being raised or lowered in value by Eα or E±ηs operators external to that space, just as
ily operators with axes orthogonal to ˆz. As
the m eigenvalues of lz are shifted by lx ±

c) The directions of α (or ηs) vectors in the ˆhi space run in that space at equal

d) For d even, the resulting operators Eα (or Eηs) shift the values of two mi parameters
by unity simultaneously, thus preserving the parity of the
i mi. The same holds for
most of the ladder operators for odd-dimensional systems, too, with the following
exception: Odd-dimensional systems include a single operator Eηs (one among a

parity conservation.

Appendix A outlines a procedure to identify raising and lowering operators.

These elements, developed originally in [5, 6], aﬀord a basis for constructing
complete sets of hyperspherical harmonics by transforming a single prototype harmonic
with complete sets of Eα (or Eηs) operators. Preferred prototypes have a single non-
zero value of mi parameters, typically

total number of alternative m vectors generated by the present procedure, denoted by

highest value 2, thus violating the limitations on the mi; only E−η1 operates on the
harmonic (4.6) correctly. Sets of harmonics are grouped into “layers” according to the
number of lowering operators that have been applied to the “highest weight” harmonic
in the process. Successive steps of lowering the ms quantum numbers are similarly
restricted, but aﬀord alternative actions of lowering operators, as displayed in table 1.

Table 1 also illustrates the eﬀect of non-vanishing commutators between ladder
operators: diﬀerent ordering of the same ladder operators may yield diﬀerent harmonics
with the same label m, i.e., a degenerate eigenvalue, such as m =
in table 1.
Furthermore, while the procedure demonstrated in table 1 will give the correct number
of linearly independent harmonics, these may not necessarily be orthogonal (with the
usual deﬁnition of a Hermitian scalar product as an integral over the relevant space:
f ∗ g dx). For a more detailed discussion of the issues of multiple eigenvalues

4.4. Harmonics for application to atoms and molecules

Diﬀerent sets of hyperspherical harmonics serve to represent diﬀerent aggregates, at
diﬀerent stages of their development. More speciﬁcally, each set reﬂects the structure
of the relevant “Jacobi tree” introduced in section 3.2, whose “growth” mirrors the
integration of the relevant (1.2), as a function of its hyper-radius R. We deal here
with particular aspects of harmonics selection, beginning with the remark that, at
low R values where centrifugal potentials prevail, governing the single particles, the
set described in section 3.1 may prove adequate, complemented possibly by the set of
section 3.2. The following sections deal with two particular aspects of our subject.

4.4.1.
Symmetrized harmonics Particle aggregates include generally sub-sets of
identical particles: electrons, of course, but also atomic nuclei such as the numerous
protons of hydrocarbons. As a preliminary to the eventual requirement of anti-
symmetrizing wave functions under permutation of fermion positions, or analogous
operations on bosons, it often proves convenient to select at the outset harmonics’ sets
that are invariant under permutation of all identical-particle variables [41, 42]. This
preliminary operation serves particularly to reduce the dimension of each harmonics’
set.

Typically each electron pair may rotate about its centre of mass only with orbital
momenta equal to an even (odd) multiple of ~ when in a singlet (triplet) spin state. The
same holds familiarly for the nuclear states of para- (ortho-)molecular hydrogen. This

the third column. The ﬁrst two columns list the m quantum numbers in the ηs and Hi bases, respectively, while the last column identiﬁes
the harmonics as superpositions of functions (3.3) by listing their corresponding labels

restriction reduces the relevant sets’ dimensions by exponential factors when applied to
large sets of identical particles, complemented by enforcing the corresponding symmetry
between diﬀerent particle-pairs, a more laborious procedure known as the selection of
“fractional parentage” [85], [82, Chapter 8], but applied more conveniently at the outset
of any calculation.

4.4.2. Expansion of whole state representations Expanding the whole solution Ψ(R)
of (1.2) into hyperspherical harmonics may also serve to illustrate the resulting
representation of a multi-particle state. The set of hyperspherical harmonics must,
however, be complemented for this purpose by a harmonic function of the hyper-radius
R, a generalization of the familiar Bessel functions in two dimensions and of their related
“spherical Bessel” functions in three dimensions. The required harmonic functions of R
belong once again to the Bessel-function family.

5. Hyperspherical expansion of the wave equation

The preliminary treatment of hyperspherical harmonics in section 3 suﬃces to formulate
an expanded version of (1.2). On the left-hand side of this equation, the factors R(3N −4)/2
have been separated out to allow setting a ﬁnite initial value of Ψ(R, ˆR) at R = 0. The
factors separated out take into account the centrifugal—actually, wave-mechanical—
potential generated in polar coordinates with small values of R by compressing particles
within short “parallel circles”. We may then standardize wave functions that start at R
= 0 with unit value in a single hyperspherical channel (λ0, µ0), expanding as R increases
into alternative channels (λ, µ), as indicated by

Here Z( ˆR) /R represents the Coulomb potential energy of the interacting particles,
evaluated at each hyper-radius R. The dots at the end of (5.3) stand for any additional
terms of the k2 matrix corresponding to Hamiltonian terms that represent spin-orbit
or relativistic corrections not included explicitly. The ability of (5.2) to include such
eﬀects—thus far not exploited—may by-pass the current need to treat such terms
perturbatively rather than directly in the basic equation.

The system of coupled equations (5.2) is formally inﬁnite, owing to the inﬁnite
range of its parameter λ, thus seemingly impractical as noted in section 1. However,
circumstances also described in section 1 reduce its size generally to a modest level.

5.1. Displaying the evolution toward fragmentation

Our approach to displaying this evolution derives from features of the fragmentation of
nuclei that are held together by short-range interactions [86]. Beyond this range, r0,
energy eigenfunctions resolve into fragmentation eigenchannels, labelled here by ρ, each
of them propagating at r > r0 in force-free space with unchanged structure, i.e., with
spherical wave-fronts, r-independent angular distributions fρ(θ, ϕ) and uniform phases
φρ(r). The parameter sets
embody here the eﬀect of all particle
interactions at r < r0.

These sets’ dependence on R displays each eigenchannel’s evolution as R increases from
its 0 value (at the system’s centre of mass) towards

Requiring each phase φρ(R) of Φρ(R), and its gradient (dφ/dR), to be uniform
over each hyper-surface (R = const.) identiﬁes each superposition (5.4), Φρ(R), as an
eigenchannel of the propagating Schr¨odinger equation (1.2) at each value of R. It thus
implies that the angular eigenfunction fρ(R; ˆR), representing the aggregate’s “shape”

Each line’s slope mirrors the rate of increase of φρ(R), i.e. (loosely), the rate of expansion
in R of the corresponding eigenfunction. [The ﬁrst eigenphase’s slope reﬂects the rapid
motion of an electron ionized with approximately 33 eV kinetic energy; successive curves
reﬂect the increasingly slower development of two-electron excitations in successively
higher modes.] In the lower and upper ranges of the ordinate φρ, corresponding to low
values of sin[φρ(R)], pairs of curves appear to cross with minimal disturbance, owing
to unresolved values of the coupling coeﬃcient on the right of (5.7b), in spite of the
singularity arising from the vanishing of its denominator at each crossing. Major eﬀects
of crossings emerge instead at middle ranges of φρ(R), where pairs of curves appear to
repel each other experiencing major deﬂexions.

Sub-sets of terms acting between particles with equal (opposite) charges push

corresponding particle sub-sets apart (together). Within this scope one notes that:

a) Expressing the distance between each atomic nucleus and another particle in terms
of their common mass-weighted hyper-radius R scales up its charge by its mass’
square root, thereby boosting its interactions’ strength and thus favouring molecular
dissociation as compared to ionization by electron ejection.

b) The force acting on each particle-pair depends on the pair’s orientation.
Combining the Coulomb forces between various particle-pairs involves thus
extensive geometrical transformations of the relevant position coordinates.

Coulomb interactions between sub-sets of identical particles may be conveniently
grouped, particularly so following the symmetrization of relevant position coordinates
outlined in section 4.4 and in Appendix D. It would then become possible to combine
Coulomb terms pertaining to such sub-sets to yield expressions of their electrical
multipole moments and of their corresponding multipole ﬁelds. A semi-macroscopic
view of each aggregate’s mechanics should thus emerge, in terms of collective variables.
Within the context of initial combination of molecular nuclei with closed-shell
electrons, one could then envisage treating all molecular valence electrons as forming
a gas whose electric multipole moments are inﬂated by electronic mutual repulsions,
yet contained by the attractive multipole ﬁelds of nuclei and closed-shell cores. The
proton-nuclei of hydrocarbon molecules would be similarly viewed. This attractive
containment would perform a two-fold action: Holding the molecule together as a unit

Appendix A. Construction of ladder operators

The generic inﬁnitesimal operators (2.6) raise and lower the eigenvalues, mi and mj, of
operator pairs (Hi, Hj) by mapping a single harmonic onto a superposition of harmonics
with diﬀerent mi’s and mj’s. We construct here linear combinations of those operators
that raise or lower by unity these eigenvalues in a deﬁnite way, according to (4.5).

Casting for this purpose (Hi, Hj) in the form of the ﬁrst two expressions in (2.2),

For odd dimensions, ℓ ladder operator pairs pertaining to coordinate pairs (i, 0)

If again xi, yi make up the operator Hi pertaining to

inﬁnitesimal rotation operators which involve either of xi or yi, together with the single

Finite transformations of multi-dimensional harmonics (or operators) correspond to the
inﬁnitesimal ones considered in section 4 just as the prototype transformation (2.3)
(pertaining to a physical-space rotation) corresponds to the inﬁnitesimal (2.1). This
correspondence holds generally, since all transformations relevant to this paper resolve
into products of two-dimensional rotations, as stressed repeatedly in the text.

Section 4 has identiﬁed hyperspherical harmonics in the frame of a representation
based on a vector λ in the ℓ-dimensional space of maximally commuting operator sets
. Within this scope, we might deal here just with ℓ-dimensional rotations of λ.

Viewing physical-space rotations, identiﬁed by three Euler angles, as our model,
recall how two of these angles pertain to rotations about a z-axis (hence parallel to an
xy-plane) and the third one to a shift of ˆz’s orientation to a new direction ˆz′, usually
understood to lie on the previous xz-plane. Whereas rotations by an angle ϕ about
ˆz simply multiply eigenvectors of lz with eigenvalue m by eimϕ, rotations by an angle
θ in the xz-plane transform it into a superposition of eigenvectors whose eigenvalues
m′ result by transforming the initial m with the Wigner matrix d(l)
m′m(θ). [The index l
stands here for the largest value (“highest weight”) of m.]

Correspondingly, in a multi-dimensional space, we consider two distinct classes of
two-dimensional rotations: (i) Rotations about one of the
operators’ symmetry
axes (i.e., in a plane orthogonal to that axis) which multiply a harmonic eigenvector of
λi by eimiϕi; and (ii) Orientation changes of an Hi’s own axis,

Appendix D. Outline of procedures for treating large sets of identical
particles

is rather familiar, being extended to atomic shell-ﬁlling, e.g.,

Constructing wave functions of a few (3–4) electrons, with the required anti-
symmetrization,
in
Chapter 8 of [82]. Its extension to much larger sets remains problematic. Deceptively
simple considerations, to be presented below, indicate that this extension may actually
proceed along the same lines, essentially because successive steps prove independent
of one another. Whether these considerations constitute more than just a “solution
in principle” for this fundamental problem of quantum many-body theory remains
to be seen. The inevitable exponential proliferation of operations to be carried
out hampers their actual implementation for all but the smallest sets of particles.
Signiﬁcant simpliﬁcations occur particularly for a system’s ground state conﬁguration
owing to (in general) higher symmetry in this state. Even for this case, however, the
anti-symmetrization of sets with more than three identical particles still presents a
formidable task. The most promising approach to this problem’s systematic solution
and its implementation is currently being developed by Barnea and Novoselsky [42]
employing the concepts discussed in this Topical Review, namely, Jacobi coordinates
and hyperspherical harmonics.

Coordinates and their symmetrization

Identity of particles implies that permutation of any pair of them leaves any function
of the pair unchanged. Artiﬁcial labelling of such particles, by indices i = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
appears nevertheless generally desirable for purposes of “book-keeping”.
It is then
necessary to “symmetrize” any function of particle positions, f (r1, r2, . . .) to ensure
its invariance under permutation of each pair of indices (i, j), by superposing sets of
such functions diﬀering by the whole set of relevant permutations. Spin and position
coordinates should be combined, of course, in this construction that proves increasingly
laborious with increasing number of particles.

Classiﬁcation by seniority

The “seniority” label (“v”) of an atomic state indicates the number of its particle pairs
characterized as 1S and thus isolated from its remaining particles. This characterization
means invariance under rotation of space coordinates of both spin and position variables.
The spin part of this label applies equally regardless of the total number of particles
in the system. The “S” label implies a spherically symmetric matching of the pair’s
angular distribution, whose extension to multi-dimensional systems needs elaboration.
Considering that this symmetry is attained by combining a pair of orbitals even and
odd, respectively, under reﬂection through a plane—thus stretching in orthogonal
directions—we suggest achieving the corresponding invariance in higher dimensions by
combining pairs of hyperspherical harmonics pertaining to Jacobi trees constructed by

Geometry and symmetries of multi-particle systems

42

selecting orthogonal space directions at each step-wise addition of one particle.

Introduction of “triple tensors”

This operation, introduced by Judd in the 1960’s and described in [82, pp 209ﬀ], yields a
systematic classiﬁcation of the shell-ﬁlling process for the electrons of each atomic shell.
It rests on elementary applications of coordinate-rotation transformation pairs and of
their “reduction”, which appear as equally serviceable regardless of their dimensionality.

Separation of particle sub-sets

This operation,
familiar in atomic systems and leading there to the “fractional
parentage” procedure, has a major role in multi-particle settings where, typically,
electron sub-sets perform varied functions forming “closed shells” (or sub-shells) of
diﬀerent atoms as well as chemical bonds, preserving the relevant symmetry and
coherences. The structure and ﬂexibility of the Jacobi trees corresponding to alternative
hyperspherical harmonics appear well suited to extension to multi-particle settings, with
appropriate development of recursion techniques.

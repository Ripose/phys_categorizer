The optical response of the lowest energy isomers of the B20 family is calculated using time-
dependent density functional theory within a real-space, real-time scheme. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences
are found among the absorption spectra of the clusters studied. We show that these diﬀerences can
be easily related to changes in the overall geometry. Optical spectroscopy is thus an eﬃcient tool to
characterize the planar to tubular structural transition, known to be present in these boron based
systems.

For the past years, boron nanostructures have at-
tracted the attention of both theoretical and experimen-
tal physicists. This is due to the remarkable properties
of boron, that make it an unique element in the peri-
odic table, with important technological applications.1,2
Boron is characterized by a short covalent radius and
has the tendency to form strong and directional chemical
bonds.1,2 These characteristics lead to a large diversity of
boron nanostructures – clusters,3,4,5,6,7 nanowires,8 and
nanotubes9,10 – that have already been observed.

Many experimental studies of small boron-based clus-
ters have been performed in the last decade, namely us-
ing mass and photo-electron spectroscopies.3,4,5,7 How-
ever, we still have very limited information regarding
the geometries and electronic properties of these sys-
tems. From the theoretical point of view, there have
been extensive ab initio quantum chemical and den-
sity functional calculations about the structural proper-
ties of neutral,3,5,7,11,12,13,14,15,16 cationic,15,17,18 and an-
ionic clusters.5,7 The ﬁndings were fairly surprising. In
fact, bulk boron appears in several crystalline and amor-
phous phases, the best know of which are the α- and
β-rombohedral, and the α-tetragonal, also known as low
temperature or red boron. In these three phases, boron
is arranged in B12 icosahedra1,19,20 (in the α-tetragonal
phase these icosahedra are slightly distorted). However,
the small clusters appear in four distinct shapes:16 con-
vex, spherical, quasi-planar, and nanotubular – totally
unrelated to the B12 icosahedra.

The most stable members of the Bn family with n . 20
are known to be planar.3,5,11,12,13,14,15 Recent calcula-
tions showed that Bn clusters with n = 24 and n = 32
prefer tubular structures.16 In a recent study7 Kiran et
al. placed the transition between these two topologies
at n = 20. However, their results were not totally con-
clusive: while the theoretical calculations (using density
functional theory at the B3LYP/6-311+G∗ level) yielded
a double ring arrangement as the lowest energy isomer
−
20, the experimental photo-electron spectra
of B20 and B
of anionic aggregates of the same size were only com-
patible with planar structures. Such a incongruity can
be explained by the diﬃculties associated both to the

experimental and numerical techniques. Experimentally,
the clusters were produced by laser evaporation of a disk
target, with the formation of the fragments being mainly
controlled by kinematics. The situation is similar, e.g.,
to the case of C20: while the rings are easily produced
by laser evaporation, the apparently more stable bowl
and cage arrangements do not form spontaneously, but
can only be obtained by fairly sophisticated chemical
techniques.21 On the other hand, the theoretical determi-
nation of the lowest energy isomer is a very arduous task
to current computational material science. The reason is
twofold: i) with increasing number of atoms the number
of metastable isomers increases exponentially; ii) and of-
ten the energy diﬀerence between competing structures
−
becomes quite small. In the case of B
20, e.g., the four
lowest lying isomers are separated by less than 0.3 eV
(15 meV per atom).7 Clearly, this precision is beyond cur-
rent density functional and quantum chemical methods
for systems of this size. Once again, C20 is an illustra-
tive example: to unveil its elusive ground state, scientists
have tried density functional theory at various levels,22,23
quantum Monte Carlo,22 coupled cluster,24 etc., without
reaching any agreement regarding the energy ordering of
the isomers.

In view of this situation, instead of relying on a single
number, i.e., the total energy, in order to characterize
a system, it is better to resort to the several spectro-
scopic tools available to both computational and exper-
imental physics.
It was, for example, the case of C20,
where the bowl and the cage isomers were identiﬁed by
comparing the vibrionic ﬁne structures in photo-electron
spectra with numerical calculations.25 In this paper we
propose the use of another spectroscopic tool, namely
optical absorption, to provide clear signatures of the dis-
tinct B20 isomers.
In fact, when the orbitals involved
in the optical transitions are quite extended, as in the
case of these boron clusters, optical spectroscopy in the
visible and near-ultraviolet (near-UV) range turns out
to be a rather sensitive probe of the overall shape of
the system. In contrast to total energy diﬀerences, the
absorption spectra are usually quite insensitive to small
changes in the geometry, to the parametrization used for

the exchange-correlation potential, and to changes in the
pseudopotentials. This makes this tool valuable in study-
ing structural transitions.

Our procedure relies on density functional theory and
is brieﬂy explained in the following. The geometries
were optimized with the computer code siesta,33 em-
ploying a double ζ with polarization basis set. From
the optimized geometries, we then obtain the optical
spectra within time-dependent density functional theory
(TDDFT) in real time, as implemented in the computer
code octopus,27 using the PBE parametrization34 in
the adiabatic approximation for the exchange-correlation
potential. For a technical description of this method
we refer to Refs. 27 and 28. This approach has al-
ready been used for the study of metal and semi-
conducting clusters,28,29 aromatic molecules,30 protein
chromophores,31 etc. Moreover, it proved quite success-
ful in distinguishing the diﬀerent isomers of C20.32 When
experimental spectra were available for a direct compar-
ison, TDDFT within an adiabatic local density (LDA)
or an adiabatic generalized gradient (GGA) approxima-
tion to the exchange-correlation functional reproduced
the low energy peaks of the optical spectra with an ac-
curacy of 0.1 eV.28 This is in contrast with taking the
diﬀerences of the eigenvalues of the HOMO and LUMO
orbitals, which would give peaks at lower frequencies in

disagreement with the experimental spectra.32

To represent the wave-functions in real space we used
a uniform grid with a spacing of 0.23 ˚A, and a box ex-
tending 5 ˚A from the outer nuclear positions. A time step
of 0.0013 fs assures the stability of the time propagation,
and a total propagation time of 24.5 fs allows a resolution
of about 0.1 eV in the resulting spectrum.

The isomers of B20 considered in this work can be di-
vided in three broad categories (see Figs. 1 and 2): a
– a nanotubular structure; b to e – quasi-two dimen-
sional (2D) clusters; and f – a three dimensional (3D)

cage, that we obtained through a minimization proce-
dure starting from a dodecahedron (a B20 fullerene-like
structure). The geometries that we selected include the
lowest energy isomers found in Ref. 7. Furthermore, we
decided to add the cage isomer f, in order to reach more
general conclusions on the eﬀects of the 2D-to-3D tran-
sition on the optical response.

Total energies calculated at the relaxed geometries
both with siesta33 and octopus27 conﬁrm that the
tubular structure a is the lowest lying isomer of the
B20. This is in agreement with the previous ﬁndings of
Ref. 7, obtained using a B3LYP functional and a Gaus-
sian basis set.
In our calculation then follow isomers
c (∆E=0.43 eV), d (∆E=0.54 eV), f (∆E=0.62 eV), b
(∆E=0.81 eV), and e (∆E=0.91 eV). Note that the or-
dering is consistent with the one proposed in Ref. 7, ex-
cept for cluster f, which was not considered in Ref. 7 as a
low energy candidate for B20. This discordance can be at-
tributed to the basis set used in Ref. 7, or to the changes
in the exchange-correlation functionals or pseudopoten-
tials. Once again this reveals the danger of relying solely
on the total energy to characterize such structural tran-
sitions.

The results of our calculations are summarized in
Figs. 1 and 2, where we plot the computed dipole strength
for six low-lying members of the B20 family. Besides the
absorption spectra averaged over the three polarization
directions (solid gray lines), we also depict the three com-
ponents for light polarized along the Cartesian axis (see
Fig. 1 a for the deﬁnition of the axis).

From the observation of Figs. 1 and 2, it is clear that
the isomers of B20 have strikingly diﬀerent absorption
properties in the visible and near-UV, the range most
easily accessible by experimental techniques. The tubu-
lar cluster a exhibits a large sharp peak at 4.8 eV, and
two small peaks at around 2.7 and 3.9 eV. Also the quasi-
planar isomer b absorbs light at well deﬁned frequencies,
with a main peak at 3.8 eV and a shoulder at 3.5 eV. The
other quasi-2D structures c, d, and e no longer exhibit
sharp peaks, but instead present broad features. This
is easily explained by noting that these clusters have a
larger distribution of bond lengths, due to the lack of
symmetry around the boron centers. This is particularly
evident in isomer c, resulting in an almost structureless
spectrum that grows monotonically until around 5.4 eV.
Nevertheless, the diﬀerences between these three spectra
are still suﬃcient to distinguish among them: cluster d
has a well deﬁned peak at 3.9 eV, and the double peak at
4.0 and 4.4 eV is a clear signature of cluster e. Isomer f
absorbs weakly visible and near-UV light. All quasi-2D
isomers do not show any appreciable response for light
polarization perpendicular to their plane; moreover, the
response is stronger along the direction in which the clus-
ter is more extended. Also in the case in which the plane
is rolled up to form a tube, the contributions to the peaks
come almost exclusively from absorption of light polar-
ized perpendicularly to the axis of the tube.

In order to understand better the absorption in the

states of the isomers a (left) and b (right). The magenta
(cyan) isosurface corresponds to the positive (negative) part
of the wave-functions.

planar and tubular isomers, we can learn from the shape
of the Kohn-Sham orbitals (see Fig. 3). Both the HOMO
and the LUMO, and several other states relevant to ab-
sorption, have predominantly π symmetry (with some σ
admixture due to the breaking of planarity, which is par-
ticularly important in the case of the tubular shape). In
this kind of compounds, the optical gap decreases with
increasing length of the π system, and consequent in-
crease of delocalization of the valence electrons. This is
exactly what we observe in our spectra of planarlike iso-
mers: isomer b, extending to almost 10 ˚A in the x direc-
tion absorbs at the lowest energy, followed by isomer e,
and ﬁnally c and d. As already mentioned, these isomers
are almost transparent for light polarized perpendicular
to the plane (z direction in the ﬁgure). In fact, the light
polarized in the z direction cannot excite the π–π∗ transi-
tions and thus gives an almost negligible contribution to
the spectra. In isomer a, there is a stronger contribution
of the σ bonds to the relevant orbitals due to the curva-
ture of the tube wall (see Fig. 3), which induces a consid-
erable blue-shift of the main peak. Finally, we discuss the
3D cage f (see Fig. 2). As its bonds have a predominantly
σ character, it does not exhibit strong absorption below
6 eV. As in the case of the irregular quasi-2D clusters, the
large number of inequivalent boron atoms is responsible
for the absence of well deﬁned peaks.

The present results for B20, together with the analo-
gous results for C20 isomers,32 lead to some conclusions
of wider validity. Two factors contribute to the position
of the peaks and the overall shape of the spectra: i) the
extension of the π system, which is directly related to
the dimensionality and basic geometry of the cluster, de-
termines the frequencies of strong absorption; and ii) the
distribution of bond-lengths, related to the number of
inequivalent boron atoms, determines if the spectrum is
composed of sharp peaks or broad features. These fac-
tors are quite general, and are thus expected to apply
to boron clusters of diﬀerent sizes and any other class of
clusters with similar chemical bonds.

In conclusion, we have shown how optical spectroscopy
can be used to distinguish without ambiguity between the

4

diﬀerent low-energy members of B20 family. The spectra
in the visible and near-UV are very sensitive to the overall
shape of the isomers. This is a general property that can
be easily explained by simple geometrical arguments. In
particular, the most stable neutral B20 isomer, i.e. the
tubular cluster, can be unequivocally identiﬁed due to the
presence of a very sharp resonance at about 4.8 eV. For
this reason, we believe that optical spectroscopy can be
an extremely eﬃcient tool to study structural transitions
in clusters. In the case of Bn aggregates, the comparison
between experimental and computed absorption spectra,
could bring a deﬁnitive answer to the unsolved question

of the critical size at which the transition between the
planar and tubular structure occurs.

Abstract. Photoassociation of ultracold atoms induced by chirped picosecond pulses is analyzed in a non-

perturbative treatment by following the wavepackets dynamics on the ground and excited surfaces. The

initial state is described by a Boltzmann distribution of continuum scattering states. The chosen example

is photoassociation of cesium atoms at temperature T=54 µK from the a3Σ+

u (6s, 6s) continuum to bound

levels in the external well of the 0−

g (6s + 6p3/2) potential. We study how the modiﬁcation of the pulse

characteristics (carrier frequency, duration, linear chirp rate and intensity) can enhance the number of

photoassociated molecules and suggest ways of optimizing the production of stable molecules.

We shall brieﬂy review here the description of the initial

state of the photoassociation process, as a thermal equi-

librium state in a gas of cold alkali atoms, lying in a trap

of inﬁnite dimension with the laser turned oﬀ (then not

interacting with the electromagnetic ﬁeld), and being ini-

tially in their (ns) ground state. Supposing low atomic

densities, which allows to consider the binary events iso-

lated enough, the N-body (N

mation of non-interacting pair Hamiltonians, treated in

the Born-Oppenheimer approximation [34]. Then, for a

colliding pair of atoms, the molecular Hamiltonian HM

of mass motion which does not play any role in photoas-

aries L0 and LR of the grid, which, by choosing a suﬃ-

ciently small β-value [29], permits the suppression of the

so-called “ghost” levels appearing in the solution of the

stationary Schr¨odinger equation and then susceptible to

falsify the dynamics of the system. We have veriﬁed that

a value β = 0.52 is necessary for avoiding the appearance

of “ghost” levels.

To determine the stationary eigenstates of the ground

or excited potential (which are used either for the selection

of the initial state, or to analyze the wavepackets evolution

in terms of their decompositions on stationary states) an

auxiliary cosine basis set is introduced, allowing to eval-

uate analytically the ﬁrst order derivatives d/dx involved

in the kinetic operator [29].

The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for the two cou-

pled channels (see Eq. (17)) is solved by propagating the

initial wavefunction using a Chebychev expansion of the

evolution operator exp[

i ˆHt/¯h] [27,28]. Propagation is

performed in discrete steps with a time increase ∆t much

shorter than the characteristic times of the problem (pulse

duration, vibrational periods, Rabi periods). In the present

study of photoassociation with chirped pulses the Hamil-

tonian H(t) is explicitely time-dependent, and a discrete

description of H(t) is introduced. During the step corre-

sponding to time propagation from t1 to t2 = t1 + ∆t,

the Hamiltonian is supposed to be time-independent and

chosen as H(tm), where tm = (t1 + t2)/2. Such a proce-

dure introduces errors of the order of magnitude (∆t)3.

In time propagation calculations one has to multiply

We shall brieﬂy review the main relations concerning pulses

We have also obtained an increase of the population by

a factor of 4.3 when considering the pulse τC =34.8 ps

(τL=15 ps), and increasing the coupling by a factor of

16, corresponding to a peak intensity IL=3.36 MW cm−2

for the transform limited pulse.

Finally, a factor of 5 on the probability reported in the

last column of Table I was obtained in case of the pulse

with τC = 47 ps (τL=12 ps), by reducing the detuning to

0.0695 cm−1, therefore moving the value of RL to 150 a0.

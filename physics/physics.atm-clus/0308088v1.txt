Some low-energy three-body muon- and electron-transfer processes are considered within
the Faddeev-Hahn formulation using two-, six-, and ten-state close-coupling approxima-
tion. We test our approach in bound-state problems for systems H+
2 and (µ−dd)+ within
six- and ten-state schemes, where d is a deuteron and µ a muon. We present results in
the six-state model for muonium formation from hydrogen. We also present results for
muon-transfer rates from muonic hydrogen isotopes to bare nuclei S16 and Ar18 in rea-
sonable agreement with experiment. For these heavier targets a polarization potential is
included and Coulomb potentials are treated exactly without approximation or cut oﬀ.

A theoretical description of low-energy three-body rearrangement reaction with the
exchange of a heavy particle invalidates the simplifying Born-Oppenheimer approximation
and requires a full quantum treatment. Here we study several three-body charge-transfer
reactions and bound-state problems using the Faddeev-Hahn formulation [1] where the
full wave function is broken into two components. In the case of three charged particles
composed of positive and negative charges there are at most two asymptotic two-cluster
bound conﬁgurations. The two components of the wave function carry the asymptotic
boundary condition in these two channels. For numerical treatment we employ two-, six-,
and ten-state close-coupling schemes.

After testing the approach to the bound states H+

2 and (µ−dd)+ we consider charge-
transfer reactions. Hydrogen has three isotopes: protium H, deuterium D, and tritium T.
It may be an important test for any formulation to predict reaction rates as a function of
isotopes. Muonium (Mu) is composed of a positive muon µ+ and an electron and can be
treated as an ultra-light hydrogenic isotope compared to protium, deuterium and tritium,
because the proton is about nine times heavier than the muon. Because of diﬀerences
in mass, muonium formation can demonstrate rather diﬀerent dynamical properties than
the reactions of other isotopes of hydrogen. For this reason we consider the reaction for
muonium production in muon-hydrogen collision: µ+ + H1s → Mu1s+ H+.

Due to interest in the possibility of muon-catalyzed fusion of the hydrogen isotopes, a
study of muon transfer from hydrogen isotopes to nuclei XZ+ with charge Z is of great

interest. There have been several experimental measurements of muon transfer from
muonic hydrogen isotopes 1Hµ and 2Hµ to bare nuclei H, He, C, O, Ne, S, Ar, Kr, Xe
etc. denoted by (Hµ)1s + XZ+ → (Xµ)(Z−1)+ + H+. The rates increase by few orders of
magnitude as one moves from the light nuclei H, He to the heavy ones. These reactions are
very relevant as a small contamination of these heavier elements will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
the process of muon-catalyzed fusion of hydrogen isotopes. Muon-transfer reaction with
these nuclei has very strong ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction and is a real challenge to any
theoretical formulation. Here we report results for muon transfer rates for S16+ and A18+.
The well-known Faddeev equations in momentum space [1] are supposed to be the most
adequate way of considering rearrangement scattering problems at low energies. However,
a direct application of the integral Faddeev equations to Coulombic three-body systems
is impossible due to long-range character of the Coulomb interaction. The Coulomb
interaction brings in signiﬁcant singularities in the kernels of these equations.

Recently, we formulated a few-body quantum-mechanical description of direct charge-
transfer reaction from hydrogen to diﬀerent nuclei using Faddeev-Hahn-type equations in
the close-coupling approximation [2]. In this approach the three-body wave function is
taken as Ψ = Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) + Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2), where ~ri, i = 1, 2, 3 is the position vector of particle
i, ~rij = ~ri − ~rj, and ~ρk is the relative position of k from the center of mass (cm) of i and
j. Here Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) is quadratically integrable over the variable ~r23, and Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2) over
the variable ~r13. These components satisfy the Faddeev-Hahn equations [1]
(E − H0 − V23 − UP )Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) = (V23 + V12 − UC)Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2),
(E − H0 − V13 − UC)Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2) = (V13 + V12 − UP )Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1).
Here H0 is the total kinetic energy operator, Vij the pair Coulomb potential, E the total
cm energy, UP = 9Z 2/(4ρ4) the polarization potential (included with a short-range cut oﬀ
for only muon transfer to Ar and S), UC the ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction between 2 and
bound state (13). The close-coupling equations based on these equations are projected
on the total angular momentum J = 0 appropriate at low energies and then solved
numerically by discretization.

respectively, compared to the accurate result of 0.597139 au [3]. For the spectral levels of
the muonic molecular ion (µ−dd)+ the six- and ten-state models lead to −326.4 eV and
−325.2 eV, respectively, for the ground-state energy compared to the accurate variational
result of −325.0735 eV [4]. The corresponding numbers for the lowest excited state are
−33.1 eV, −35.0 eV, and −35.8444 eV [4], respectively.

Cross sections σex for muon production are presented in Fig. 1 as function of k(2) =
3.7 ×
qE(eV) together with the theoretical results of work [5]. There is substantial
diﬀerence between the two calculations at low energies. We found that the contribution
of p-waves in sub-systems is reasonable and ranges up to 20 − 40%.

Finally, we present the results of muon transfer from H isotopes to Ar and S. In this
case the transfer takes place mostly to two levels of the muonic nuclei and we consider
only these two levels in the present calculation. The muon is captured predominantly in
the 10s and 10p states of Ar and 9s and 9p states of S [6]. We compare the results in
Table 1 with available experiments quoted in Ref. [7]. The correct order of magnitude for
the rates is already produced without a polarization potential. A previous calculation of
muon-transfer rates to lighter nuclei (He, C, O) [2] is also in agreement with experiment
and a very recent calculation [8]. From this and previous studies [2] we conclude that
the present formulation is equally suitable for bound states as well as three-body charge
transfer reactions involving large ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction.

Revisiting the Complexity of Finding Globally
Minimum Energy Conﬁgurations in Atomic Clusters

Abstract

It has previously been proven that ﬁnding the globally minimum energy conﬁgura-
tion of an atomic cluster belongs in the class of NP-hard problems. However, this proof
is limited only to homonuclear clusters. This paper presents a new proof which shows
ﬁnding minimum energy conﬁgurations for heteronuclear clusters is also NP-hard.

1 Introduction

Atomic clusters are aggregates of atoms held together by the same forces that cause, for
example, phase transition from vapor to liquid, formations of crystals, etc. Cluster sizes
range from as few as three atoms up to several hundred atoms. The physical and chemical
characteristics of a cluster often varies with its size. In fact, even the addition of a single
atom can result in an entirely diﬀerent structure. Only by successively adding more and
more atoms will a crystal-like structure eventually be produced and some knowledge of the
condensed phase attributes be determined [1].

The study of atomic clusters has steadily been increasing over the past decade [2]. Of
particular interest is the cluster conformation (structure) which has the lowest total internal
energy E. Knowledge of this minimum energy conformation provides valuable clues relating
to the chemical and physical properties of the cluster. Unfortunately, searching for the
globally minimum energy state of a cluster has proven to be enormously diﬃcult. Indeed,
Wille and Vennik [3] showed that locating the globally minimum energy state of a cluster
of identical atoms—the homonuclear case—belongs in the class of NP-hard problems. This
means there is little hope of exactly solving the problem in ﬁnite time for even moderate
cluster sizes.

The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, it will be shown why existing homonuclear
proofs, and work from other related problems, cannot be used for the heteronuclear case
where not all of the atoms are identical. Secondly, a proof will be presented which does
show solving the heteronuclear problem is NP-hard.

2 Preliminaries

The problem of ﬁnding this globally minimum energy structure is equivalent to optimizing
E with respect to variations in all 3N − 6 degrees of freedom where N is the cluster size.

1

One method of solving this optimization problem is to explore the potential energy surface
(PES) composed of all possible cluster conformations. Each point on this surface represents
a unique spatial arrangement of the constituent atoms. This multidimensional surface is
characterized by numerous local minima, each indicating an energetically stable structure.
If it were possible to enumerate all of these minima—and the saddles that link them—we
could, in principle, describe the dynamics of chemical reactions governed by that surface.
Unfortunately, enumerating all minima is extremely diﬃcult because of their large number.
Berry [4] indicates the number of geometrically distinct minima tends to grow exponentially
with N. Moreover, the number of permutational isomers grows factorially with N.

A number of general methods have been proposed for ﬁnding global minima on a PES, in
particular, and on hypersurfaces in general. For example, Monte Carlo methods [5], eigen-
vector following [6], evolution computation techniques [7]-[9], lattice optimization/relaxation
techniques [10], and PES deformation techniques [11, 12] have all been used with varying
degrees of success. After formally deﬁning the clustering problem, we will discuss some of
these techniques in greater detail.

The potential energy function for a cluster of N atoms is given by

V (rN ) =

v(ri − rj)

(1)

Xi, j
i 6= j

where rN = (r1, r2, . . . , rN ), ri is the position vector of the ith atom and v(ri−rj) is a function
representing the pairwise interaction between atoms. Lennard-Jones or Morse functions are
frequently used for these functions. Our optimization problem of interest is the Discrete
Cluster Problem (DCP) which is formally deﬁned as follows:1

DISCRETE CLUSTER PROBLEM
INSTANCE: Given ﬁnite number of points in real space, a distance d(i, j) ∈ Z + between
two points i, j, an integer N ∈ Z + and a known potential energy function deﬁned by (1).
QUESTION: Is there a way to assign N atoms to N unique points so as to minimize the
sum of their pairwise interactions?

The potential energy of a cluster actually equals the sum of N-body interactions. Re-
stricting this sum to only two-body interactions provides only a qualitative approximation.
Three-body interactions can be important, but are usually ignored in ﬁrst order approxima-
tions [13]. Although many-body interactions are needed for quantitative modeling, little is
actually known about higher order terms. Many-body potential energy functions do exist
[14], though in practice, only two-body terms are used for the sake of computational speed.
Consequently, the discussion here will likewise be restricted to the two-body case.

It may appear that the large amount of work done with hard-sphere packing problems
will be helpful in solving instances of DCP. Unfortunately, such is not the case because
the objective of the two problems are quite diﬀerent. Hard-sphere packings try to place N
spheres in Euclidean space so that all can, without overlap, ﬁt within as small a volume as
possible [15]. DCP deals with soft, compliant spheres which interact via pairwise interaction

functions. Figure 1 shows a Lennard-Jones function, which is typical. Therein lies the major
diﬀerence between hard-sphere and soft-sphere systems: the former has no preferred distance
between the spheres while the latter does. Put another way, a hard-sphere packing algorithm
attempts to minimize the interatomic distance r. Yet, a comparison with Figure 1 clearly
shows this does not yield the lowest energy state for an atomic pair. Hard-sphere packing
studies can thus be expected to provide little help.

An algorithm that searches for solutions to the homonuclear version of DCP was recently
proposed by Hendrickson [16]. The general approach exploits structural information to
decompose the global optimization problem into a set of smaller optimization problems.
More speciﬁcally, N objects in Euclidean space are represented as an undirected graph
where the edge weights reﬂect the interobject distance. A subgraph is identiﬁed, the relative
positions of the vertices are optimized, and the subgraph is then treated as a rigid body.
These rigid bodies are ultimately combined to determine the overall structure. Such an
approach won’t work for the heteronuclear case, but this discussion will be diﬀered until
Section 3.

Northby [10] performed a lattice based search that takes an initial conformation and
allows it to relax to an energy minimum. Essentially, a random search is conducted to
compile a list of isomers. After pruning any geometrically equivalent isomers, the remaining
conformations are relaxed under a Lennard-Jones pairwise interaction function. While this
technique will work with heteronuclear clusters, it does depend upon a gradient search which
makes it susceptible to stopping at local optima.

Kostrowicki et al. [11], presented a technique that “deforms” the PES in such a way that
the number of local minima is dramatically reduced. This deformation requires solving a
partial diﬀerential equation called a diﬀusion equation. All atoms are assumed to interact by
a Lennard-Jones type of function which is approximated by a linear combination of Gaussian
functions to permit expressing the answer analytically. Solving these diﬀusion equations is
not necessarily easy as there are some pathological conditions. For example, numerical

3

problems can occur when the atoms are separated by large distances and so interact only
weakly. This technique works best if one can suitably modify the boundary conditions for
the diﬀusion equation, but care must be taken to ensure the minimum energy state is not
removed from the deformed PES.

Wales and Doye [12] described another PES transformation technique called “basin hop-
ping”. Here the PES is converted into a set of basins of attraction for the local minima.
This approach does has the advantage of not altering the energies of the minima. It has
been used to ﬁnd many of the local minima for Lennard-Jones cluster sizes up to N = 110,
The authors suggest some improvements that could be made to improve the eﬃciency of
their approach.

It is important to note that none of these techniques will, with certainty, guarantee a
successful search for the globally minimum energy conﬁguration. In the next section we will
see why solving instances of DCP has proven to be so diﬃcult.

3 Complexity in Homonuclear Clusters

An instance of DCP can be solved by exploring the PES associated the cluster, and any
algorithm that does this can be used with both homonuclear and heteronuclear systems. A
number of researchers indicate the number of local optima in a PES grows exponentially
with N [4, 17, 18]. So, exactly how much eﬀort is required to explore an exponentially large
hypersurface? Some insight can be found from the theory of NP-completeness [19].

Suppose each time step a new point on the hypersurface is visited. Repeating this process
until all points are visited—a procedure guaranteed to ﬁnd the minimum energy state—will
take an exponential number of time steps. Now consider an arbitrary NP-complete problem
P. If we found an algorithm that could solve P in polynomial time, then this algorithm
could solve every NP-complete problem in polynomial time. Unfortunately, no algorithm
that solves an NP-complete problem has ever been found which executes in less than an
exponential number of steps. This suggests the eﬀort required to conduct a blind search
of the hypersurface is similar to the eﬀort required to solve an NP-complete problem. NP-
complete problems are computationally intractable, which gives some idea of the diﬃculty

shows the ramiﬁcations of having so many local optima.)

NP-complete problems are deﬁned as decision problems, that is, problems answered by
either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. NP-hard problems ask for the optimal solution to an NP-complete prob-
lem. And, they have at least the same level of diﬃculty to solve as does the corresponding
NP-complete problem. One particular NP-hard problem plays a pivotal role in the com-
plexity analysis of DCP. It is the well known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) which is
formally deﬁned as follows:

TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM
INSTANCE: A ﬁnite set C = {c1, c2, . . . , cm} of cities, and a distance d(ci, cj) ∈ Z + for each
pair of cities ci, cj ∈ C.

Wille and Vennik [3] used TSP to prove solving a homonuclear instance of DCP is NP-
hard. It is worthwhile to examine their proof in some detail since our proof of NP-hardness
for the heteronuclear case follows a similar line of reasoning.

Instances of DCP can be expressed in graph-theoretical terms using a graph G = (V, E)
with vertex set V and edge set E. The graph G is complete (i.e., the edge e = hu, vi ∈
E ∀ u, v ∈ V ). Furthermore, |V | ≫ N. The edges are assigned weights w(e) ∀ e ∈ E
where the weights reﬂect the interaction between vertices. An instance of DCP is therefore
equivalent to selecting V ′ ⊂ V with |V ′| = N so that

Figure 2: An example graph. The graph is dense and edges are weighted as given by Eq.
(3). The problem is to select N vertices so that the sum of the weighted edges is minimized.

The proof of Wille and Vennik uses an undirected graph G = (V, E) with |V | = N(N −1)
vertices (see Figure 2). Each vertex is labeled with (ci, cj) where i, j = 1, . . . , N and i 6= j.
This indicates city cj is visited immediately after city ci. Edges are then unordered pairs of
the form

Selecting N vertices, {(cπ(i), cπ(i+1)); i = 1, . . . , N, cπ(N +1) = cπ(1)}, so that the sum of the
weights is minimal is equivalent to ﬁnding a minimal length tour hcπ(1), cπ(2), . . . , cπ(N )i thus
solving an instance of TSP. By restriction [19], this also makes DCP NP-hard to solve. This
completes the Wille and Vennik proof.

The weight assignments given in Eq. (3) require some clariﬁcation. In TSP, weight is
equivalent to distance whereas in DCP weight is equivalent to pairwise potential energy.
Any plausible solution to an instance of TSP can visit each city but one time. In valid tour
moves, the edge weight equals the intercity distance. Disjointed tours have edges with zero
weight—eﬀectively removing that edge from the edge set E. This insures all tours can be
deﬁned as a permutation of m cities (see below). An illegal tour move has an edge with
inﬁnite weight. The total weight of the edges traversed in a tour measures the “goodness”
of that tour; good tours have lower total edge weights. More speciﬁcally,

1. i 6= k and j 6= l. This deﬁnes a disjointed tour where the tour visits ci followed by cj
and ck followed by cl. However, it is not shown what other cities were visited between
cj and ck. Therefore, it is not possible to describe the permutation and compute its
tour length.

2. i = k and j 6= l. This deﬁnes an illegal tour that leaves the same city to visit two

3. j = l and i 6= k. This deﬁnes an illegal tour where two distinct cities visit the same

diﬀerent cities.

next city.

4. l = i and k = j. This deﬁnes an illegal cyclic tour among only two cities.

5. l = i, k 6= j or k = j, l 6= i. These are legal tours.

Each of the N vertices in the minimal length tour is assigned a distinct atom from the
cluster. In homonuclear clusters all one-to-one assignments of atoms to these N vertices
are equivalent since the edge weights are based only on interatomic distance. This begins to
explain why the Wille and Vennik proof [3] and the Hendrickson algorithm [16] cannot be
extended to the heteronuclear case.

First, consider a homonuclear cluster with N > 2 atoms and suppose a new cluster is
formed by swapping the spatial position of two atoms. It is not possible to tell any physical
diﬀerence between the two clusters because all atoms are identical and the interatomic
distances remain unchanged. Indeed, the new cluster will have a total energy identical to
the original cluster because the pairwise interaction functions (v(ri − rj) in Eq. (1)) remain
unchanged. Now suppose the cluster is composed of two distinct atom types, say Ar and Xe.

6

The repulsive and attractive forces experienced by an Ar-Ar atom pair diﬀers from those
experienced by Ar-Xe or Xe-Xe pairs even if all pairs are separated by the same interatomic
distance [20]. Swapping atom positions in heteronuclear clusters changes the type of atoms
which interact, altering the individual interaction functions, and giving a diﬀerent total
energy to the new cluster.

With homonuclear clusters it is acceptable to consider atoms as simple identical spheres
where only interatomic distances contribute to the total energy. It is natural to model this
system as an undirected graph where the edge weights reﬂect forces derived solely from the
interatomic distances. The search algorithm from [16] takes this approach thereby permitting
the cluster to be optimized in stages by optimizing the relative positions in subgraphs. The
complexity proof given in [3] also made that assumption. In fact, the graph used for that
proof was constructed speciﬁcally without requiring any pair type information to set the
edge weights. That restriction was necessary to establish an equivalence between TSP and
DCP.

In heteronuclear systems, both atom type and distance determine pairwise forces so the
corresponding graph must have edge weights that take both distance and atom type into
consideration. Even the relative positions of vertices from a subgraph cannot be optimized
without the weights being set in this manner. Consequently, search algorithms such as [16]
cannot be used for heteronuclear clusters because the overall cluster structure depends on
connecting rigid bodies, formed from optimized subgraphs, where the edge weights only
consider interatomic distance.

To apply the proof of Wille Vennik [3] to heteronuclear clusters, the graph would have to
be augmented with additional vertices. For example, suppose in the original (homonuclear)
graph two vertices i and j are connected by an edge e = hi, ji. Then w(e) is based solely
on the interatomic distance between atoms i and j. The augmented graph would have
a new vertex j′ where the added edge e′ = hi, j′i has a weight w(e′) computed from the
interaction of two dissimilar atoms, spaced at a distance d(i, j′) = d(i, j). However, now the
mere selection of N vertices—suﬃcient to solve a homonuclear DCP—does not guarantee
the correct mixture of atom types present in the heteronuclear cluster. This restricts the
proof from [3] to only homonuclear systems.

4 Complexity in Heteronuclear Clusters

A diﬀerent proof of complexity is needed for the heteronuclear clusters. This new proof
makes use of the following NP-hard problem [19]:

TRAVELING SALESMAN EXTENSION (TSE)
INSTANCE: A ﬁnite set C = {c1, c2, . . . , cm} of cities, a distance d(ci, cj) ∈ Z + for each pair
of cities ci, cj ∈ C, a bound B ∈ Z +, and a “partial” tour

Θ = hcπ(1), cπ(2), . . . , cπ(K)i

of K distinct cities from C, 1 ≤ K ≤ m.
QUESTION: Can Θ be extended to a full tour

hcπ(1), cπ(2), . . . , cπ(K), cπ(K+1), . . . , cπ(m)i

7

having total length B or less?

Consider a heteronuclear cluster which has a single atom of one type (denoted by α)
and N − 1 atoms of a diﬀerent type (denoted by β). A completely connected graph is
G = (V, E) with |V | = N(N − 1) is constructed with each vertex labeled as described in
Section 3. Without loss in generality preassign an α-atom to all vertices with labels (c1, cj),
j = 2, . . . , N and preassign a β-atom to all remaining vertices.

The search begins with a scan of all edges that touch vertices with α-atom assignments.
Select the minimum weight edge.2 This edge deﬁnes a partial tour hcπ(1), cπ(2)i. Now select
N − 2 more vertices, {(cπ(i), cπ(i+1)); i = 3, . . . , N, cπ(N +1) = cπ(1)}, so that the sum of these
weights is minimal. (This search is limited to vertices with β-atom assignments in order to
maintain the proper mixture of atom types in the corresponding cluster.) Finding a minimal
length full tour is thus equivalent to solving an instance of TSE. This proves that DCP is
NP-hard to solve for heteronuclear clusters as well.

5 Discussion

The complexity in solving DCP forces researchers to use heuristic search algorithms. Hill-
climbing algorithms are not expected to do well because the PES has many local optima
and it is highly likely the algorithm will quickly stop at one of them. Conversely, stochastic
search algorithms can be quite eﬀective in such multimodal hypersurfaces. It is therefore
natural to ask if any one particular algorithm stands out as doing especially well against
DCP.

This question is not easy to answer and we need to turn to the No Free Lunch (NFL)
Theorem [21] for an explanation. Essentially, this theorem says if some optimization (search)
algorithm performs particularly well over a certain class of optimization problems, then it
most likely will not perform as well over all remaining optimization problems. This means
one cannot choose, for example, simulated annealing to use for DCP just because it happens
to work well for, say, scheduling problems. Direct comparisons between algorithms are
insightful. But, without a conscientious attempt to make the comparisons fair, the results
may be inconclusive, or in the worst case, be completely wrong [22]. Monte Carlo techniques
have been dominant in the area of cluster studies, which is why newly proposed search
algorithms are normally compared against them.

Most notable among the new algorithms are the evolutionary algorithms, which conduct
searches that mimic Darwinian evolution: a “population” of clusters evolve to a low energy
state by altering existing conﬁgurations via stochastic reproduction operators. Natural se-
lection determines which conﬁgurations survive to undergo further reproduction operations.
Comparisons between evolutionary algorithms and Monte Carlo techniques have favored
the former, although such comparisons sometimes lack suﬃcient mathematical rigor. For
example, Zeiri [9] concluded that a genetic algorithm converges faster than simulated an-
nealing after comparing the average of ﬁve runs—an unusually small sample size. Normally
results should be averaged over a considerably higher number of runs to help remove any
potential bias in the random number generators used in the algorithms. Nevertheless, there

Monte Carlo techniques when applied against DCP [8][20] [23]-[26]. It appears as though
evolutionary algorithms would be a good ﬁrst choice search algorithm for cluster studies.

The author wishes to thank the anonymous reviewers who made several pertinent and valu-
able suggestions.

Abstract

We have used the Stern-Gerlach deﬂection technique to study magnetism in chromium clusters

of 20–133 atoms. Between 60 K and 100 K, we observe that these clusters have large magnetic

moments and respond superparamagnetically to applied magnetic ﬁelds. Using superparamagnetic

theory, we have determined the moment per atom for each cluster size and ﬁnd that it often far

exceeds the moment per atom present anywhere in the bulk antiferromagnetic lattice. Remarkably,

our cluster beam contains two magnetically distinguishable forms of each cluster size with ≥ 34

atoms. We attribute this observation to structural isomers.

Even before the rise of nanoscience, atomic clusters were of keen interest to people trying

to understand how the physical properties of atoms and molecules evolve with size and shape

into those of bulk materials. Clusters are true many-body quantum systems, too large for

exact solutions in ordinary space and too small for exact solutions in momentum space, and

the properties they exhibit are often rich and complex.

One such property, magnetism, oﬀers unparalleled insight into clusters because it is sen-

sitive to electronic and spatial structure, quantum size eﬀects, surface to volume ratio, sym-

metry, and even temperature. Magnetism has been studied in low-dimensional supported

systems (e.g., powders, granular metals, surfaces, and ﬁlms) since Neel’s pioneering work in

the late 1940s and in isolated clusters since 1990.[1, 2, 3]

Because clusters have reduced average coordination numbers relative to bulk and can

adopt unusual shapes and symmetries, clusters of the ferromagnetic 3d transition metals

were expected to have enhanced magnetism.[4, 5] Experimental studies of iron, cobalt,

and nickel clusters do indeed ﬁnd enhanced magnetism,[6, 7, 8, 9, 10] although their gi-

ant magnetic moments are partly obscured by the thermal ﬂuctuation phenomenon known

as superparamagnetism.[1, 2, 11].

Even more dramatic enhancements of magnetism were predicted in clusters of rhodium[12,

13] and manganese,[14] 4d and 3d transition metals that are merely paramagnetic in the bulk.

Experimental measurements of isolated rhodium and manganese clusters ﬁnd large magnetic

moments in small clusters of these two elements.[15, 16, 17]

Chromium, another of the 3d transition metals, is an itinerant antiferromagnet in the

bulk. Below its ∼311 K N´eel temperature, bulk chromium exhibits a transverse spin-density

wave (SDW) that becomes a longitudinal spin-density wave below ∼123 K.[18] At zero

temperature, chromium’s SDW has a moment per atom of 0.43 µB rms and 0.62 µB peak.

If chromium clusters had this same itinerant antiferromagnetic order, as though they were

simply portions of the bulk bcc lattice, their moments per atom could not exceed 0.62 µB.

Even 0.62 µB per atom is small compared to what is observed in iron, cobalt, and nickel

clusters.[6, 8, 9, 19] It came as no surprise then when an early study in our laboratory was

unable to detect magnetism in chromium clusters of 9–31 atoms and set an upper limit of

0.77 µB per atom for their magnetic moments.[20] More recently, chromium clusters sup-

ported on Au surfaces were shown to be antiferromagnetic.[21] Nonetheless, several theoreti-

cal studies predicted that small chromium clusters should be magnetic.[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]

2

In this paper, we report the results of a new Stern-Gerlach deﬂection study of chromium

clusters in a cluster beam. Between 60 K and 100 K, all of the clusters we studied (20–133

atoms) have non-zero magnetic moments and deﬂect toward strong magnetic ﬁeld. In many

cases, the clusters are too magnetic to be simple fragments of the bulk lattice. Further-

more, our cluster beam contains no less than two magnetically distinguishable forms of each

cluster size with 34 atoms or more. The most plausible explanation for these magnetically

distinct populations is structural isomers—clusters with equal numbers of chromium atoms

but diﬀerent crystal structures.

The possibility that chromium clusters occur in electronically distinguishable isomers was

suggested by Nickelbein, when he observed two distinct ionization potentials for Cr8 and

Cr18.[28]. Knickelbein did not report on any clusters larger than Cr25, however, and an

earlier photoelectron spectroscopy study by Wang reported no evidence for isomers between

Cr1 and Cr55.[29]

In outline, our experiment consists of producing a collimated and temperature-controlled

beam of chromium clusters, deﬂecting that beam with a gradient-ﬁeld magnet, and deter-

mining the masses and deﬂections of the clusters downstream from the magnet. While the

apparatus and techniques we used in the present study are similar to those used previously

in our laboratory,[30] a number of technical improvements have greatly enhanced the overall

sensitivity and reproducibility of the measurements. In particular, a new cluster source oﬀers

more complete control of cluster temperatures and an automated data acquisition protocol

allows us to take many diﬀerent measurements concurrently and thereby reduce systematic

errors due to small but unavoidable long-term drifts in the apparatus.

Chromium clusters form when focused 2nd-harmonic light (532 nm) from a Nd:YAG laser

vaporizes part of a chromium sample rod in the presence of a pulse of dense helium gas.

The resulting mixture of chromium vapor and helium then ﬂows through a temperature-

controlled tube, 2.5 mm in diameter and 150 mm long, before expanding supersonically into

vacuum through a 1 mm diameter nozzle.

The long ﬂow tube is critical to controlling cluster temperature.[31] Because the

chromium/helium mixture spends ∼1 ms or more passing through this tube, there is time

for cluster growth to die away and for the chromium clusters and helium gas to come into

thermal equilibrium with the tube itself. The seeded supersonic expansion that subsequently

produces the cluster beam is quite eﬀective at cooling the clusters’ translational temperatures

3

and is moderately eﬀective at cooling their rotational temperatures. But the expansion is

too brief and too ineﬃcient to have any signiﬁcant eﬀect on the clusters’ vibrational temper-

atures. For all practical purposes, the chromium clusters’ vibrational temperatures remain

in equilibrium with the ﬂow tube itself.

The chromium cluster beam is collimated by two narrow slits and a chopper wheel before

entering the deﬂecting magnet. That electromagnet is a quadrant of a quadrupole,[32] 254-

mm long, with a transverse ﬁeld of up to 0.950 T and a transverse ﬁeld gradient of up to

360 T/m. While in the magnet, each cluster experiences a force ∇(Nµ·B), where µ is the

cluster’s magnetic moment per atom, N is the number of atoms in the cluster, and B is the

magnetic ﬁeld. Since the force is perpendicular to the beam, the clusters deﬂect.

After the magnet, clusters pass through a ﬁeld-free drift region, 1.183-m long, and into

the ionization region of a time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer. There, a spatially ﬁltered ArF

excimer laser pulse (193 nm), directed antiparallel to the cluster beam, ionizes a narrow slice

of that beam for mass analysis by the spectrometer. By scanning the laser light across the

range of possible deﬂections and recording the cluster populations found at each location,

we accumulate deﬂection proﬁles for many clusters sizes simultaneously. Small adjustments

in timings and ion optics were necessary, however, to gather deﬂection proﬁles for the full

range of cluster sizes reported in this paper (20–133 atoms).

Chromium clusters, like all transition metal clusters studied previously in beams, deﬂect

solely toward strong ﬁeld.[6, 7, 8, 9, 10] Such behavior is consistent with superparamag-

netism, a thermal relaxation phenomenon in which a cluster’s internal magnetic moment

ﬂuctuates rapidly in orientation and explores the entire Boltzmann distribution in a time

short compared to the measurement time. For an isolated cluster, vibrational modes act as

the heat bath responsible for thermal ﬂuctuations and its vibrational temperature therefore

appears in the Boltzmann factor. Since the Boltzmann distribution favors orientations that

are aligned with an applied magnetic ﬁeld, a superparamagnetic particle exhibits a time-

averaged magnetic moment that is aligned with an applied magnetic ﬁeld and that increases

as that ﬁeld increases.

This time-averaged magnetic moment is what our deﬂection experiment measures. As-

suming that the cluster’s superparamagnetic moment is large enough to be treated classically

and that all moment orientations are equal in energy in the absence of an applied ﬁeld, the

time-averaged or eﬀective magnetic moment per atom (µeﬀ) is given by the Langevin func-

4

tion:

µeﬀ = µL(NµB/kTvib)

(1)

= µ[coth(NµB/kTvib) − (kTvib/NµB)]

where B is the magnetic ﬁeld and Tvib is the vibrational temperature of the cluster, which

we take to be the temperature of the source. Having determined a cluster’s measured

magnetic moment per atom µeﬀ from its deﬂection in a speciﬁc ﬁeld at a speciﬁc vibrational

temperature, we invert Eq. (1) to obtain µ, the magnitude of the cluster’s true magnetic

moment per atom, µ.

Because the magnetic moments of the chromium clusters were relatively small, we made

all of the measurements at low temperatures (60 K to 100 K) and high ﬁelds (0.5 T to 1 T).

Over this range of temperatures and ﬁelds, we saw no deviation from superparamagnetism

in any of the chromium clusters—the measured moments per atom were always consistent

with Eq. (1).

We did observe, however, the separation of deﬂecting chromium clusters into two distinct

populations, one signiﬁcantly more magnetic than the other. Cr41, shown in Fig. 1, is one

of many cluster sizes exhibiting this behavior. When we increase the magnetic ﬁeld and

ﬁeld-gradient, the spatial proﬁle of Cr41 clusters divides into two partially resolved peaks.

Each peak separately obeys Eq. (1), but with its own magnetic moment per atom, µ. About

58% of the Cr41 clusters have µ = 0.40 ± 0.01 µB and about 42% have µ = 1.00 ± 0.01 µB.

We have never observed such magnetically distinguishable cluster populations in any of

the other transition metals, despite considerable eﬀort in that regard. A study of cobalt

clusters performed concurrently with this chromium study observed only single deﬂection

peaks for all cobalt clusters at all temperatures and all magnetic ﬁelds.[33] While superpara-

magnetic deﬂection peaks always broaden with increasing deﬂection, due primarily to the

thermal statistics of ﬁnite systems,[34] so far only chromium clusters have exhibited multiple

superparamagnetic deﬂection peaks.

Figure 2 shows the magnetic moment per atom µ for chromium clusters of 20–133 atoms.

For Cr30 and Cr34–Cr133, we observe two peaks in the deﬂection proﬁle and therefore report

two values for µ. The relative abundances of clusters in those two peaks are represented in

Fig. 2 by the relative areas of their marker circles.

The onset of magnetically distinguishable clusters at Cr34 follows a dramatic drop in

a gradient magnetic ﬁeld. Experimental data points are indicated. The solid curve is a ﬁt to

those points, constructed by summing the two Gaussians indicated by the dashed curves. While

each population behaves superparamagnetically, they have diﬀerent magnetic moments per atom,

to those populations separate from one another.

magnetism at Cr33. Below that size, only Cr30 shows unambiguous evidence of a separable

population. Above that size, two sequences of chromium clusters are present in the beam,

one signiﬁcantly more magnetic than the other. The magnetic moments per atom and the

relative populations of those two species evolve gradually across the size spectrum, with the

high-moment species dominating Cr50–Cr71.

We have tried without success to explain these two populations as artifacts of the exper-

iment. The two-peak deﬂection proﬁles are robust and reproducible, and also appeared in

preliminary data taken with a very diﬀerent type of cluster source.[35] Extensive experimen-

Number of chromium atoms per cluster

FIG. 2: Magnetic moments per atom µ for chromium clusters of 20–133 atoms. Cr30 and Cr34–

Cr133 each has two magnetically distinguishable isomers so two value of µ are shown. The areas

of the circles marking those two µ values are proportional to the populations of their respective

isomers in the cluster beam. The error bars indicate statistical uncertainties (1 SD). Systematic

uncertainties (not shown) are ±0.1 µB.

tation with source parameters has established that the two populations do not diﬀer simply

in temperature. The complicated and reproducible evolution of relative populations and the

surprisingly large moments per atom of the high-moment species eliminate the possibility

that one population consists of agglomerated smaller clusters. The mass resolution in the

spectrometer is suﬃcient to determine that the clusters are pure chromium, free of oxygen

atoms or other important contaminants. The possibility that one population involves a

low-lying metastable electronic state that persists across a vast range of cluster size seems

remote.

The most plausible explanation for these distinct populations is structural isomers—

clusters that diﬀer in their underlying crystalline structures. Trivial isomers, in which indi-

vidual surface atoms are shifted about, are unlikely to cause such large diﬀerences in moment

or to aﬀect such a broad range of clusters so similarly. Therefore we suggest that the two

population sequences are the result of two diﬀerent crystal lattices. For example, the low-

moment sequence might resemble the bcc lattice of bulk chromium and the high-moment

sequence might be fcc-like, hcp-like, or even icosahedral.

In most of the low-moment chromium clusters, µ lies near or below the peak moment

7

per atom for the SDW in bulk chromium (0.62 µB). The wavelength of that SDW at 78 K

is about 21 bcc unit cells, so the clusters are small enough to contain just one crest of the

SDW. The gradual decrease in µ with increasing cluster size could then be explained as the

inclusion of more of the SDW.

The high-moment chromium clusters, however, cannot be fragments of the bulk bcc

chromium crystal. Cr58 has a µ of 1.16±0.02 µB, making it almost twice as magnetic

as bulk nickel and more than 70% as magnetic as bulk cobalt. This remarkably magnetic

form of chromium exists for all clusters from Cr34 up to at least Cr133, and it is possible

that it exists for smaller clusters as well. While preliminary measurements showed evidence

for the high-moment cluster all the way down to Cr9,[35] the more careful measurements

presented here were only able to conﬁrm the existence of a high-moment species for Cr30.

The periodic rises and falls in µ across each of the two sequences are most likely due to

geometric shell structure. Studies in other transition metal clusters have observed minima

in µ near shell closings, where the clusters are most compact and bulk-like, and maxima in

µ between shells closings, where the clusters are least compact.[8, 36, 37] That the maxima

and minima in µ occur at diﬀerent sizes in the two sequences may indicate that their shell

closings are diﬀerent.

In summary, we have observed magnetism in chromium clusters of 20–133 atoms at

temperatures between 60 K and 100 K. For Cr30, Cr34-Cr133, we ﬁnd two magnetically

distinguishable populations, with the high-moment species being far more magnetic on a

per-atom basis than anything in bulk chromium. We propose that these two populations

are the result of structural isomers, with the high-moment clusters having an underlying

crystal structure diﬀerent from that of bulk chromium.

In this work, we have used the exchange-only optimized eﬀective potential in the self-consistent
calculations of the density functional Kohn-Sham equations for simple metal clusters in stabilized
jellium model with self-compression. The results for the closed-shell clusters of Al, Li, Na, K, and
Cs with N =2, 8, 18, 20, 34, and 40 show that the clusters are 5% more compressed here than in
the local spin density approximation.

INTRODUCTION

The Kohn-Sham (KS)[1] density functional theory
(DFT)[2] is one of the most powerful techniques in elec-
tronic structure calculations. However, the exact form
of the exchange-correlation functional is still unknown
and, in practice, one must use approximations. The ac-
curacy of the predictions of the properties depends on
how one approximates this functional. The simplest one
is the local spin density approximation (LSDA) in which
one uses the properties of the uniform electron gas lo-
cally [1]. This approximation is in principle appropriate
for systems in which the variations of the spin densi-
ties nσ are suﬃciently slow. For ﬁnite systems and sur-
faces which are highly inhomogeneous, the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA)[3] is more appropriate.
In spite of the success of the LSDA and GGA, it is ob-
served that in some cases these approximations fail to
predict even qualitatively correct behaviors[4, 5, 6, 7].
On the other hand, appropriate self-interaction corrected
versions of these approximations are observed to lead to
correct behaviors[7, 8]. These observations motivates one
to use functionals in which the self-interaction contribu-
tion is removed exactly. One of the functionals, which
satisﬁes this constraint, is the exact exchange (EEX) or-
bital dependent functional. Using the EEX functional
leads to the correct asymptotic behavior of the KS po-
tential as well as to correct results for the high density
limit in which the exchange energy is dominated [9]. Al-
though neglecting the correlation eﬀects in orbital depen-
dent functionals fails to reproduce the dispersion forces
such as the van der Waals forces[10, 11], the EEX in
some respects is advantageous over the local and semi-
local approximations[11, 12]. To obtain the local ex-
change potential from the orbital dependent functional,
one should solve the optimized eﬀective potential (OEP)
integral equation. Recently, K¨ummel and Perdew [13, 14]
have invented an iterative method which allows one to
solve the OEP integral equation accurately and eﬃciently
even for three dimensional systems. This method is used
in this work.

To simplify the cluster problem, one notes that the

properties of alkali metals are dominantly determined
by the delocalized valence electrons.
In these met-
als, the Fermi wavelengths of the valence electrons are
much larger than the metal lattice constants and the
pseudo-potentials of the ions do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect
the electronic structure. This fact allows one to replace
the discrete ionic structure by a homogeneous positive
charge background which is called jellium model (JM).
In its simplest form, one applies the JM to metal clus-
ters by replacing the ions of an N -atom cluster with
a sphere of uniform positive charge density and radius
R = (zN )1/3rs, where z is the valence of the atom and
rs is the bulk value of the Wigner-Seitz (WS) radius for
valence electrons[15, 16, 17]. Assuming the spherical ge-
ometry is justiﬁed only for closed-shell clusters which is
the subject in this work. However, it is a known fact
that the JM has some drawbacks[18, 19]. The stabilized
jellium model (SJM) in its original form[20] was the ﬁrst
attempt to overcome the deﬁciencies of the JM and still
keeping the simplicity of the JM. Application of the SJM
to simple metals and metal clusters has shown signif-
icant improvements over the JM results[20]. However,
for small metal clusters the surface eﬀects are important
and the cluster is self-compressed due to its surface ten-
sion. This eﬀect has been successfully taken into account
by the SJM which is called SJM with self-compression
(SJM-SC)[21, 22]. Application of the LSDA-SJM-SC to
neutral metal clusters has shown that the equilibrium
rs values of small clusters are smaller than their bulk
counterparts and approaches to it for very large clusters.
initio.
This trend is consistent with the results of ab.
calculations[23, 24].

In this work we have used the EEX-SJM-SC to obtain
the equilibrium sizes and energies of closed-shell neutral
N -electron clusters of Al, Li, Na, K, and Cs for N =2, 8,
18, 20, 34, and 40 (for Al, N = 18 corresponds to Al6
cluster and other values do not correspond to a real Aln).
Comparison of the results with those in the LSDA-SJM-
SC, which also includes correlation, shows that, in the
EEX-SJM-SC, the clusters are more compressed. The
organization of this paper is as follows. In section II we
explain the calculational schemes. Section III is devoted
to the results of our calculations and ﬁnally, we conclude

this work in section IV.

II. CALCULATIONAL SCHEMES

In this section we ﬁrst explain how to implement the
exact exchange in the SJM, and then will explain the
procedure for the OEP calculations.

A. Exact exchange stabilized jellium model

As in the original SJM[20], here the Ashcroft empty
core pseudo-potential[25] is used for the interaction of an
ion of charge z with an electron at a relative distance r:

w(r) =

−2z/r , (r > rc)
, (r < rc)

0

(cid:26)

(1)

The core radius, rc, will be ﬁxed by setting the pres-
sure of the bulk system equal to zero. In the EEX-SJM,
the average energy per valence electron in the bulk with
density n is given by

ε(n) = ts(n) + εx(n) + ¯wR(n, rc) + εM (n),

(2)

with

ts(n) = ckn2/3,

εx(n) = cxn1/3,

(3)

(4)

ck =

(3π2)2/3,

cx =

(3/π)1/3.

(5)

All equations throughout this paper are expressed in
Rydberg atomic units. Here ts and εx are the kinetic
and exchange energy per particle, respectively.
¯wR is
the average value of the repulsive part of the pseudo-
potential ( ¯wR = 4πnr2
c ), and εM is the average Madelung
energy. Demanding zero pressure for the bulk system at
equilibrium yields:

2ts(n) + εx(n) + 12πnr2
(cid:8)

c + εM (n)
(cid:9)

Solution of this equation for rc gives

n=nB = 0.

In Fig. 1 we have plotted the core radii for diﬀerent
values of rB
s which assume 2.07, 3.28, 3.99, 4.96, and
5.63 for Al, Li, Na, K, and Cs, respectively. The result is
compared with the case in which the correlation energy
is also incorporated [see Eq.(26) of ref. ]. As is seen, to
stabilize the bulk system in the EEX case, the core radii
assume smaller values.

Here, hδviW S is the average of the diﬀerence potential

ﬁned as the diﬀerence between the pseudo-potential of a
lattice of ions and the electrostatic potential of the jel-
lium positive background. Once the values of hδviW S
and rc as functions of rB
s are found, the EEX-SJM total

φiσ are the self-consistent KS orbitals and ψiσ are orbital

change potentials are obtained from the iterative solu-
tions of inhomogeneous KS equations. Taking spherical
geometry for the jellium background and inserting

and

To illustrate the trend in the ¯rs values, we plot the

notes that for a given element, the diﬀerence is larger for
smaller clusters. On the other hand, the diﬀerence for the
lower-density element is higher. However, the maximum
relative diﬀerence is about 5% which corresponds to the
2-electron cluster of monovalent atom with rB
s = 2.07
(corresponding to Al). We therefore conclude that the
EEX-SJM-SC predicts smaller bond lengths, at most 5%,
compared to the LSDA-SJM-SC.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We have used the EEX-SJM-SC to obtain the equilib-
rium sizes and energies of closed-shell 2, 8, 18, 20, 34,
and 40-electron neutral clusters of Al, Li, Na, K, and Cs.
In Table I we have listed the results for the equilibrium
states. As is seen, the equilibrium rs values of the clusters
are almost the same up to 3 decimals for the KLI and
OEP schemes whereas, there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between the OEP and LSDA values. As an example, we
have plotted the equilibrium rs values of the closed-shell
KN clusters in Fig. 4. It shows that the LSDA predicts
larger cluster sizes than the KLI and OEP.

FIG. 5: Diﬀerence in the equilibrium rs values of clusters

elements.

Comparison of the equilibrium total energies of the
OEP and KLI shows that OEP relative energies are on
average 0.009% more negative. This result should be
compared to the simple JM results[26] which is 1.2%.
We do not compare the total energies of OEP and LSDA
because in LSDA there exist a correlation contribution.
On the other hand, comparison of the exchange energies
show that on the average, the relative exchange energies
in OEP is 0.33% more negative than than KLI whereas,
it is 11% more negative than the LSDA (it is 9% for the
JM).

As in the simple JM, the OEP KS eigenvalue bands
are contracted relative to those of the KLI. That is, for
all N , the relation ∆OEP < ∆KLI holds. Here, ∆ =
εH − εL is the diﬀerence between the maximum occupied
and minimum occupied KS eigenvalues. For the same
external potential, the OEP and KLI results coincide for
two-electron systems and ∆ = 0. The results in TableI
show that the maximum relative contraction, |∆OEP −
∆KLI|/∆KLI , is 2.6% which corresponds to Cs18.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In this work, we have considered the exchange-only
stabilized jellium model in which we have used the ex-
act orbital-dependent exchange functional. This model
is applied for the simple metal clusters of Al, Li, Na, K,
and Cs. For the local exchange potential in the KS equa-
tion, we have solved the OEP integral equation by the
iterative method. By ﬁnding the minimum energy of an
N -atom cluster as a function of rs, we have obtained the
equilibrium sizes and energies of the closed-shell clusters
(N = 2, 8, 18, 20, 34, 40) for the three schemes of LSD,
KLI, and OEP. The results show that in the EEX-SJM,

the clusters are more contracted relative to the ordinary
LSDA-SJM, i.e., 5% more contraction. The KLI and
OEP results show equal values (up to three decimals) for
the equilibrium rs values.

The total energies in the OEP are more negative than
the KLI by 0.009% on the average. It should be men-
tioned that in the simple JM the KLI and OEP total
energies for Al were positive (except for N = 2). On the
other hand, the exchange energies in the OEP is about
0.33% more negative than that in the KLI whereas, it
is about 11% more negative than that in the LSD. The
widths of the occupied bands, εH − εL in the OEP are
contracted relative to those in the KLI by at most 2.6%.

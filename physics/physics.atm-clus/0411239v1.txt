Abstract.

Photoionization cross section of the fullerene ion C+

60 has been calculated within
a single-electron approximation and also by using a consistent many-body theory
accounting for many-electron correlations. Electronic wave functions of the ground
and excited states have been determined within the jellium model based on the local
density approximation. It is predicted a giant resonance in the photoionization cross
section at the photon energy ∼ 25 eV. It is demonstrated that the resonance proﬁle is
much higher and narrower than in the case of the neutral fullerene C60.

Since the discovery till nowadays the fullerene C60 attracts a permanent rapt
attention of investigators. From the physical point of view an interest to this object
is associated with its exotic hollow, but highly stable structure caused by a signiﬁcant
delocalization of a large number of valence electrons in this molecule. These features
manifest themselves in a number of interesting physical phenomena occuring in collision
processes involving fullerenes. For example, surface plasmon oscillations in the fullerene
C60 can be excited. The plasmon excitations have a profound collective nature and
they inﬂuence signiﬁcantly the formation of the cross sections in collisions of various
kind involving fullerenes [1]. The plasmon excitations in the fullerene C60 have been
well investigated both experimentally and theoretically [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
Usually, they manifest themselves as giant resonances in the excitation spectrum of C60.
In this connection, there arises a question on the possibility of excitation of the plasmon
oscillations in fullerene C60 ions of diﬀerent multiplicity. Recently, the photoionization
cross section of singly charged fullerene ion C +
60 has been measured [13]. However,
theoretical calculation of this cross section has not been performed so far.

In this work, for the ﬁrst time, we have calculated the photoionization cross section
of the fullerene ion C +
60 within the photon energy range from the C +
60 ionization threshold
up to 40 eV. This energy range has been chosen, because the photoionization cross

section for the neutral fullerene C60 possesses a very strong giant resonance centered
at the photon energy about 20 eV [9, 10]. Using the theoretical framework developed
earlier by us and applied for the description of photoionzation of the neutral fullerene C60
[11, 12], we have determined the location of the giant resonance in the photoionization
spectrum of C +

60 (to be equal ∼ 25 eV) and described it’s shape.

The atomic system of units is used throughout the paper, me = |e| = ¯h = 1.
The total photoionization cross section is equal to a sum of partial photoionization
cross sections for each of the fullerene ion orbitals. The amplitude of ionization of
each orbital is calculated both within the single-electron approximation and also by
taking into account many-electron correlations. At the ﬁrst stage, we use the frozen
core model and the local density approximation assuming that there is a single electron
transition only during the photoionization process. Then, the correlations between the
transitions from diﬀerent electron states are taken into account within the random phase
approximation (RPA). The RPA amplitudes of photoionization Dν2ν1(ω) are found from
the matrix form of the RPA equations [14]

Dν2ν1(ω) = dν2ν1 +

Dν2ν1(ω)χν4ν3(ω)Vν2ν1ν4ν3 .

(1)

Xν3ν4

Here, the matrix elements Dν2ν1 are expressed via the single-electron photoionization
amplitudes dν2ν1, the matrix elements of virtual electron-hole excitation ˆχ(ω), and the
matrix elements of interelectron interaction Vν2ν1ν4ν3 [14]. Note that the excitation
spectrum has the Rydberg series of discrete excited states because the self-consistent
potential of the fullerene ion has the Coulomb asymptotic. Therefore, the virtual
electron transitions to the discrete excited states of the fullerene ion play more important
role than in the neutral fullerene C60 case.

The photoionization cross section and the oscillator strengths calculated both
within single-electron approximation and also by taking into account many-electron
corellations have been checked on the consistancy with the sum rule.

density approximation. Analogously to an atom, the single-electron wave functions of
C +

60 within this model, are given by

φi ≡ φni,li,mi(r) =

where ni, li, mi is the usual set of quantum numbers for the i-th spherical shell; Ylm(θ, ϕ)
is the spherical harmonic; Pnili(r) is the radial part of the wave function determined in
the self-consistent potential of the fullerene ion. The number of nodes of the radial wave
function Pnili(r) is equal to (ni − li − 1). The main limitation of this method arises from
the electrons self-interaction. Note that the self-interaction correction does not change
the order of the electronic energy levels and the value of the total electronic energy, but
it alters the value of the ionization potential very signiﬁcantly.

As in the case of neutral fullerene, we assumed that four 2s2p electrons of each
carbon atom are delocalized in the fullerene ion C +
60. The ionic core of the fullerene is
formed by fourfold-charged positive carbon ions C 4+ with the electronic conﬁguration
1s2. The charges of the carbon ions are averaged over the sphere of radius R, being
a hypothetic radius of the fullerene ion. In this paper we neglect the variation of the
fullerene’s radius caused by its ionization and put the radius of the fullerene ion equal
to the radius of the neutral fullerene, i.e. R = 6.69 a.u. [16].

For better understanding of the electronic properties and interatomic bonding in
the fullerene molecules, it is useful to establish the correspondence of the electronic
eigenstates introduced in our model to the σ and π orbitals widely used for modeling
the planar graphite surface [11]. The ground state conﬁguration for the ion C +
60 has been
chosen in a similar way as for the neutral fullerene C60 [11]. Removing one electron from
the highest occupied molecular orbital of C60, one derives

The maximum number of electrons in a shell characterized by the orbital momentum
l is equal to Nl = 2(2l + 1). The most outer σ− (l=9) and π− shells (l=5) in C +
60 are
open and have Ne = 18 and Ne = 9 electrons respectively, whereas N9 = 38 (σ− shell)
and N5 = 22 (π− shell). This means that the total orbital moment L and the total spin
S of such a system are non-zero.

It is well known that an accurate calculation of the photoionization cross section of
an atomic system with open electronic shells is much more complicated than that for a
closed shell atomic system, because for an open shell system the calculation involves a
huge number of additional terms which vanish in the case of a closed shell system [19].
In order to avoid this technical problem we have used the averaged term approximation.

60. The outer

We have assumed that the electrons from the most outer open shells behave in the
photoionization process as if the shells would be closed. This implies that one can put
L = 0, S = 0 when calculating the partial contribution to the photoionization cross
section from these shells and take into accout their ﬁlling ratios gl = Ne/2(2l + 1) < 1.
It is natural to expect that the averaged term approximation aﬀects the
photoionization cross section behavior. The numerical analysis shows that the cross
section calculated within the single-electron averaged term approximation does not obey
the sum rule. Therefore, one should introduce appropreate correction when calculating
the photoionization cross section in the random phase approximation. Thus, we have
input extra coeﬃcients decreasing the amplitude of electron-hole excitations from the
open shells. These coeﬃcients have been determined from the sum rule analysis of
the partial photoionization cross sections of the open fullerene shells performed within
the single-electron approximation. The coeﬃcients enter as numerical factors in the
matrix elements of operator ˆχ(ω) in equation (1). Although this procedure improves
the consitence with the sum rule of the photoionization cross sections calculated within

result of our calculations of the C +
60 photoionization cross section. These calculations
demonstrate that the giant resonance pattern is not aﬀected much by the choice of the
coeﬃcient in equation (1), but the maximum value of the cross section depends strongly
on their choice.

The calculated cross section is compared with theoretical [12] and experimental
cross sections [9] for the neutral C60 in ﬁgure 3.

60, the giant resonance
in the C +
60 photoionization spectrum is placed at the photon energy 21 eV. It is well
known that the resonance energy of the plasmon oscillation can be easily evaluateded
for a spherical fullerene with the use of the classical Mie formula

where ωl is the frequency of a surface plasmon oscillation with angular momentum l and
Ne is the number of delocalized electrons. For the diplole plasmon mode, l = 1, in the
fullerene C60 with R = 6.69 a.u. [16] and Ne = 240, one derives ω1 = 20 eV.

Since we have assumed the same radius for the fullerene ion as for the neutral
fullerene and there is only a small diﬀerence in the number of delocalized electrons, it
is natural to expect that the plasmon resonance energies in the ion and in the neutral
fullerene are close. Figure 3 illustrates this fact. It shows that nevertheless there is a

slight shift of the position of the giant resonance in the C +
60 photoionization spectrum,
which might be a result of a slight variation of the radius of the fullerene ion neglected
in our calculations.

Our analysis demonstrates that the giant resonance in the photoionization cross
section for the fullerene ion arises due to the correlation between transitions from σ−
orbitals. This fact proves the similarity of the nature of the giant resonances in the
cases of the neutral fullerene and the ion. Qualitatively, one can explain the origin of
the giant plasmon resonance by oscillations of the σ− electrons density against the ionic
core.

It is also necessary to point out that the giant plasmon resonance in the
photoionization spectrum of C +
60 is much stronger as compared with that for C60. The
similar behaviour is well known from the investigation of giant resonances in many-
electron atoms and their ions. It can be explained by enhanced inﬂuence of the Coulomb
core potential on the ground and excited states of valence electrons in the case of ionic
target [19].

In conclusion we stress that the method developed in our work allowed us to predict
the plasmon resonance pattern in the photoionization cross section of the fullerene
ion C +
60. This method can be straightforwardly utilized for the calculation of the
photoionization cross sections of positive and negative ions of C60 of larger multiplicity,
which are of great interest for experimental investigations.

Abstract

The scattering of ortho positronium (Ps) by H2 has been investigated using a three-
Ps-state [Ps(1s,2s,2p)H2(X 1Σ+
g )] coupled-channel model and using Born approximation
u and b 3Σ+
for higher excitations and ionization of Ps and B 1Σ+
u excitations of H2. We
employ a recently proposed time-reversal-symmetric nonlocal electron-exchange model
potential. We present a calculational scheme for solving the body-frame ﬁxed-nuclei
coupled-channel scattering equations for Ps-H2, which simpliﬁes the numerical solution
technique considerably. Ps ionization is found to have the leading contribution to target-
elastic and all target-inelastic processes. The total cross sections at low and medium
energies are in good agreement with experiment.

1 Introduction

With the availability of improved monoenergetic ortho positronium (Ps) beam, low-energy
collision of exotic ortho Ps atom with neutral atoms and molecules is of interest in both physics
and chemistry due to its vast applicational potential [1]. Recently, measurements of total
ortho-Ps scattering cross section from various atomic and molecular targets (He, Ne, Ar, H2,
N2, C4H10, and C5H12) have been carried out at low and medium to high energies [2, 3, 4].
Experimental investigations are also in progress for the measurement of pick-oﬀ annihilation of
ortho Ps from closed shell atoms [5]. Because of the composite nature and high polarizability
of Ps, a reliable theoretical description of Ps scattering is far more complicated than electron
scattering [6], as excitations and ionization of Ps are expected to play a signiﬁcant role for each
target states. Besides if the target is vulnerable to excitations, prediction of total cross section
becomes extremely diﬃcult as the number of scattering channels grow as N 2, where N excited
states of both Ps and target are considered.

Due to internal charge and mass symmetry, Ps atom yields zero elastic and even-parity tran-
sition potentials in the direct channel and Ps scattering is dominated mainly by exchange corre-
lation [7, 8, 9]. This eventually complicates the convergence of a conventional coupled-channel
description [7]. For Ps scattering with molecular target we have additional complication due to
the presence of the nuclear degrees of freedom. The presence of three charge centers complicates
the solution scheme of the coupled-channel equations. The degree of complication can be real-
ized from the mathematical analysis of ref. [10] for Ps formation in positron-hydrogen-molecule
scattering. Because of mathematical complication, this approach has not been further pursued
in numerical analysis and there exists no successful calculation of Ps formation in positron-
hydrogen-molecule scattering. We recall that the mathematical complication of a dynamical
coupled-channel study of Ps formation in positron-hydrogen-molecule scattering is similar to
that of Ps-H2 scattering.

Here we undertake a theoretical study of Ps scattering by H2. We employ a hybrid approach
of treating the molecular orientational dependence as parameters in the coupled equations and
then perform the partial-wave expansion [11]. The resulting one-dimensional equations are
solved at the equilibrium nuclear separation by the matrix-inversion technique and the partial-
wave cross sections are numerically averaged over molecular orientations. The present approach
makes the Ps-H2 scattering problem easily tractable.

Recently, we suggested a regularized electron-exchange model potential [6, 8] and demon-
strated its eﬀectiveness in exchange-dominated Ps scattering by performing quantum coupled-
channel calculations using the ab initio framework of close-coupling method for both simple
and complex targets [7, 12, 13, 14, 15].
In our initial calculations we used a nonsymmetric
model-exchange potential for Ps scattering by H [12], He [8] and H2 [6, 13] and obtained rea-
sonably good agreement with experiment on He and H2.
In a subsequent application of Ps
scattering by H, it was found that a time-reversal symmetric form of the exchange potential
leads to far superior result than the nonsymmetric form both in qualitative and quantitative
agreement with accurate variational calculations on H [7]. The symmetric potential also led
to very good results for low-energy cross sections for Ps scattering by He, Ne, and Ar [16] in
excellent agreement with experiment [4].

In view of the above we reinvestigate the problem of Ps scattering by H2 using the symmetric
exchange potential employing the three-Ps-state [Ps(1s,2s,2p)] coupled-channel model for elastic

and Ps(2s,2p) excitations. We solve the coupled-channel equations by the above scheme and
report partial cross sections for Ps(1s,2s,2p) excitations. We also calculate cross sections for
Ps excitations to 6
3 states and Ps ionization using the ﬁrst Born approximation. A
target-elastic total cross section is calculated by adding the above partial cross sections. We use
the present symmetric exchange potential to calculate the target-inelastic Born cross sections
for excitation to B 1Σ+
u states of H2 by Ps impact. We present a total Ps-H2 cross
section by adding the above target-elastic and target-inelastic results.

2 Theoretical Formulation

The total wave function Ψ of the Ps-H2 system is expanded in terms of the Ps and H2 quantum
states as

Ψ(r0, r1, r2, x; R) =

Fab(s0)ϕa(t0)ψb(r1, r2; R)

where s0 = (x + r0)/2, t0 = (x
r0), x (r0) is the coordinate of the positron (electron) of the
Ps atom, r1 and r2 are the coordinates of the electrons of H2, 2R is the internuclear separation
of H2, ϕa the wave function of Ps, ψb the wave function of H2, with b denoting the electronic
conﬁguration of H2 and a denoting the quantum state of Ps. Here
denotes antisymmetrization
with respect to Ps- and target-electron coordinates and Fab is the continuum orbital of Ps with
respect to the target. The spin of the positron is conserved in this process and the exchange
proﬁle of the Ps-target system is analogous to the corresponding electron-target system [14].

A

Primary complication arises in the coupled-channel study in retaining both the summations
over Ps and target states in the coupling scheme. As we shall see later that the contribution
of the individual target-inelastic channels to cross section is one order small compared to that
of target-elastic channels. So we exclude the summation over target states from the coupling
scheme and treat cross section for target excitations separately using Born approximation. In
this work we are mostly interested to see whether the model can accommodate the measured
total cross sections of Ps-H2 scattering. So we retain the Ps(1s,2s,2p) excitations in the coupled-
channel model and treat the remaining excitations by Born approximation. The ﬁrst Born
calculation with present regularized exchange leads to results reasonably close to coupled-
channel calculation at medium energies. Hence it is expected that this calculation should yield
a fairly good picture of the total cross section except near the Ps-excitation thresholds.

Projecting the resultant Schr¨odinger equation on the ﬁnal Ps and target states and averaging
over spin, the resulting momentum-space Lippmann-Schwinger scattering equation in the body-
frame representation for a particular total electronic spin state S can be written as

In (8) the additional indices b and b′ are introduced on the molecular orbitals 1σg and 1σu
to distinguish the initial and ﬁnal states. The model exchange potentials (7) and (8) may
be considered as a generalization of a similar potential suggested by Rudge [21] for electron-
atom scattering. The nonlocal and time-reversal symmetric exchange potential (7) has a very
convenient form and is expressed as a product of form factors of Ps and H2. Both the direct and
exchange amplitudes have been factored out in terms of Ps and target “form-factors” leading
to a substantial simpliﬁcation of the theoretical calculation. In our previous study of Ps-H2
scattering [6, 13] the prefactor of the exchange potential was not time-reversal symmetric. In Eq.
(7) we have restored time-reversal symmetry as in ref. [8] which is found to provide signiﬁcant
improvement in the results. Although, for electron-molecule scattering several model potentials
are found in the literature [22, 23], there is no other convenient model exchange potential for
Ps scattering.

3 Numerical Procedure and Results

In the body-frame calculation the coupled-channel equations are solved at the equilibrium
nuclear separation 2R0 = 1.4a0. The polar and azimuthal angles θR and φR of R are taken as
parameters in the coupled equations [11]. This reduces (2) to the following form

After standard partial-wave projection the three-dimensional coupled scattering equations (9)
are ﬁrst reduced to coupled one-dimensional integral equations in momentum space. The one-
dimensional equations are then discretized by Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule and solved by
the matrix inversion technique. A maximum of forty points are used in the discretization of
the integrals. The discretized coupled-channel equations are solved for eight to ten discrete
values each of polar and azimuthal angles θR and φR. This leads to a convergence of cross
sections up to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures. For targets with more charge asymmetry and for polar
molecules we expect that more points will be required for angular averaging. The present
averaging amounts to solving the coupled set of scattering equations sixty four to hundred times.
Although this procedure increases the computational (CPU) time, mathematical complications
of tedious (and untractable) angular-momentum analysis [10] are thus replaced by a tractable
and convenient calculational scheme. Finally, the partial-wave cross sections are numerically
averaged over molecular orientation using Gauss-Legendre quadrature points for both polar and
azimuthal angles θR and φR. Maximum number of partial waves included in the calculation
is 12. Contribution of higher partial waves to cross section is included by corresponding Born

5

terms. These Born cross sections are also numerically averaged over all molecular orientations
in a similar fashion.

In ﬁgure 1, we show the angle-integrated target-elastic cross sections for elastic, Ps(2s+2p),
6) excitations and ionization of Ps. As expected and observed in previous calcula-
Ps(3
tions [7, 8, 12, 13] with other targets, the contribution of the Ps ionization channel to the cross
section plays a dominant role from medium to high energies as can be seen in ﬁgure 1. The
detailed angle-integrated partial cross sections of the Born and three-Ps-state calculation are
tabulated in table 1. Near 10 eV, 20 eV and 30 eV the total Born cross sections for Ps(1s,2s,2p)
are found to be nonconvergent by 28%, 9% and 4%, respectively. Near 10 eV, 20 eV and 30 eV
the total Born cross sections for Ps(n = 2) excitations are found to be nonconvergent by 18%,
6% and 3%, respectively. At 60 eV the Born and three-Ps-state results are essentially identical.
The nonconvergence of Ps(n
3) excitations calculated using Born approximation are expected
to lie within the limit set by Ps(n = 2) cross sections above. It is expected from experience
that the ionization cross section calculated using Coulomb Born will be more converged than
the Ps(n = 2) Born cross sections.

Now we concentrate on some target inelastic processes. Each target inelastic transition is
accompanied by elastic, excitation and ionization of Ps and hence by an inﬁnite number of
possibilities. Here to account for target inelastic processes we consider Ps(n = 1
6) discrete
excitations and ionization of Ps using the ﬁrst Born approximation. Contribution of higher
discrete excitations of Ps are expected to be insigniﬁcant and are neglected in the calculation.
We calculate the cross sections for the inelastic transition Ps(1s) + H2(X 1Σ+
Ps* + H2 (B
g )
1Σ+
u ) where Ps* represents the ground and the excited states of the Ps atom. These Born cross

sections are also calculated at a equilibrium internuclear separation 2R0 = 1.4a0 and ﬁnally
averaged over angular orientations of the target. In ﬁgure 2 we display the Born contribution
of partial cross sections for transition to diﬀerent Ps states while the hydrogen molecule is
excited to the H2 (B 1Σ+
u ) state. The total cross section summing the diﬀerent contributions
is also shown for this target-inelastic process. When compared with the corresponding total
cross section calculated with the nonsymmetric exchange potential [6] (not shown in ﬁgure 2)
we ﬁnd marginal change at low energies (below 20 eV) and basically no change at medium to
high energies. This is quite expected as the eﬀect of exchange dies out at higher energies and
these cross sections are controlled by the direct Born potentials.

Next we calculate the cross sections for the inelastic transition Ps(1s) + H2(X 1Σ+
g )

Ps*
+ H2(b 3Σ+
u ) using the ﬁrst Born approximation, where Ps* represents the ground and the
abovementioned excited states of the Ps atom. These cross sections are again calculated for
equilibrium internuclear separation 2R0 = 1.4a0 and averaged over molecular orientations. In
ﬁgure 3 we display the contribution of partial cross sections for transition to diﬀerent Ps states
while the hydrogen molecule is excited to the H2 (b 3Σ+
u ) state. The total cross section summing
the diﬀerent contributions is also shown for this target-inelastic process. There is signiﬁcant
change when we compare this total cross section calculated with the symmetric exchange po-
tential with our previous result [6] obtained with the nonsymmetric exchange potential. This is
quite expected as this process is purely exchange dominated. The qualitative and quantitative
diﬀerences between the two total cross sections reveal the importance of using the symmetric
exchange potential.

→

In ﬁgure 4, we exhibit the total cross section obtained from target-elastic processes (Ps
excitation up to n = 6 and Ps ionization) plus target excitations to B 1Σ+
u states
[6, 13] and compare with the total cross section measurements of ortho-Ps scattering from H2
[2, 4]. The agreement with the experimental cross sections is highly encouraging. Here, we have
considered only two lowest target-inelastic processes and their combined eﬀect on the total cross
section. This gives an indication that the inclusion of remaining important target-inelastic cross
sections might give a better agreement with measurement.

u and b 3Σ+

However, the present theoretical peak in total cross section is shifted to a lower energy
compared to experiment. This trend was also found in our calculation of Ps-He scattering [7].
In the energy range of 7 to 15 eV, the total cross section overestimates the measured data.
This is due to the fact that Ps(n
3) excitations and ionization have been treated in the
ﬁrst Born approximation framework. The neglect of other target-inelastic channels and the
ﬁrst Born calculation for higher excitations and, in particular, ionization of Ps are supposed
to be responsible for the shift in the theoretical peak. A dynamical calculation for higher Ps
excitations and ionization should reduce the theoretical total cross section in the intermediate
energy region, while the inclusion of further target-inelastic channels will increase the cross
section for medium to higher energies. These two eﬀects are expected to shift the peak in the
total cross section to higher energies and lead to a better agreement with experiment.

≥

A previous ﬁrst Born description of Ps-H2 scattering [24] with Born-Oppenheimer exchange
[25] led to unphysically large cross section at low energies. The poor performance of that
scheme in Ps scattering compared to electron scattering is due to the fact that in the absence
of the direct potential (zero for elastic scattering), the Born-Oppenheimer exchange potential
solely determines the cross section. This clearly shows the very unrealistic nature of the Born-
Oppenheimer exchange potential at low energies.

In previous studies [7, 8, 14] of Ps scattering we introduced a parameter C in the exchange
potential for obtaining a more quantitative ﬁt with experiment essentially by replacing the
denominator term in (7) by (k2
b′)/2. In the original form the
constant C = 1 and we have used this value in this study. However, it can be varied slightly from
unity to obtain a precise ﬁt of a low-energy scattering observable (experimental or variational),
as has been done in some applications of model potentials [23]. A variation of C from unity
leads to a variation of the average values for square of momenta [8, 12], which were taken
as the binding energy parameters (δ2, β2 etc.) in the expression for the denominator in (7).
This variation, in turn, tunes the strength of the exchange potential at low energies. At high
energies this model potential is insensitive to this parametrization and leads to the well-known
Born-Oppenheimer form of exchange [25].

4 Summary

To summarize, we have used a time-reversal symmetric form of the nonlocal model potential for
exchange and applied it to the study of Ps-H2 scattering. We have also presented a simpliﬁed
prescription for performing coupled-channel dynamical scattering calculation with molecular
target using a body-frame ﬁxed-nuclei scheme. With this prescription we have performed a
three-Ps-state coupled-channel calculation of target-elastic Ps-H2 scattering. Higher excitations
and ionization of the Ps atom are treated using the ﬁrst Born approximation with a regularized
exchange. We also calculated cross sections for two target-inelastic excitations of H2 (B 1Σ+
u
and b 3Σ+
u ) using ﬁrst Born approximation with present exchange considering Ps excitations
(n = 1, ..., 6) and ionization. Considering the fact that we have considered only two target-
inelastic processes, the present total cross section is in encouraging agreement with experiment.
The tractability of of the present dynamical calculational scheme for molecular targets and the
success of the present time-reversal symmetric electron-exchange potential in describing Ps-H2
scattering should stimulate further investigation with both.

Figure Caption:

1. Angle integrated target-elastic Ps-H2 partial cross sections at diﬀerent positronium ener-
gies: elastic (solid line) and Ps(2s+2p) excitation (dashed-dotted line) from three-state coupled-
n
channel model at low energies interpolated to exchange Born at high energies, Ps(6

2. Angle integrated target-inelastic Ps-H2 partial and total cross sections at diﬀerent positro-
nium energies to H2 (B 1Σ+
u ) state using the ﬁrst Born approximation: Ps(1s) (dashed-dotted
line), Ps(2s+2p) (dashed-double-dotted line), Ps(6 > n > 2) excitation (dotted line), Ps ion-
ization (dashed line), and total (full line).

3. Angle integrated target-inelastic Ps-H2 partial and total cross sections at diﬀerent positro-
nium energies to H2 (b 3Σ+
u ) state using the ﬁrst Born approximation: Ps(1s) (dashed-dotted
line), Ps(2s+2p) (dashed-double-dotted line), Ps(6 > n > 2) excitation (dotted line), Ps ion-
ization (dashed line), total (full line), total cross section with the nonsymmetric potential from
ref. [6] (dashed-triple-dotted line).

4. Total Ps-H2 cross section at diﬀerent positronium energies: total target elastic cross
section from ﬁgure 1 (dashed line), total target-elastic (from ﬁgure 1) plus target-inelastic
(from ﬁgures 2 and 3) cross section (solid line), experimental data (solid circles from ref. [2],
solid square from ref. [4]).

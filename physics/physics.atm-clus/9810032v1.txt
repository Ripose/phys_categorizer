REARRANGEMENTS AND TUNNELING SPLITTINGS
IN SMALL WATER CLUSTERS

1. Introduction

This paper was prepared in August 1997 for the proceedings volume of
the NATO-ASI meeting on Recent Theoretical and Experimental Advances
in Hydrogen Bonded Clusters edited by Sotiris Xantheas, which has so far
failed to appear.

Recent far-infrared vibration-rotation tunneling (FIR-VRT) experiments
[1–4] pose new challenges to theory because the interpretation and pre-
diction of such spectra requires a detailed understanding of the potential
energy surface (PES) away from minima. In particular we need a global
description of the PES in terms of a complete reaction graph. Hence all
the transition states and associated mechanisms which might give rise to
observable tunneling splittings must be characterized. It may be possible to
guess the detailed permutations of atoms from the transition state alone,
but experience suggests this is unwise.

In this contribution a brief overview of the issues involved in treating
the large amplitude motions of such systems will be given, with references
to more detailed discussions and some speciﬁc examples. In particular we
will consider the eﬀective molecular symmetry group, the classiﬁcation of
rearrangement mechanisms, the location of minima and transition states
and the calculation of reaction pathways. The application of these theo-
ries to small water clusters ranging from (H2O)2 to (H2O)6 will then be
considered. More details can be found in recent reviews [5–8].

2. The Eﬀective Molecular Symmetry Group

To classify the energy levels of systems executing large amplitude motions
(non-rigid or ‘ﬂoppy’ molecules) we must look beyond point group sym-
metry. The PES contains all the permutational isomers of each stationary
point. In the nomenclature of Bone et al. [9] we will refer to a structure
as a particular molecular geometry and a version as a particular labelled
permutational isomer of a given structure. Tunneling splittings occur when
rovibronic wavefunctions localized in potential wells corresponding to dif-
ferent permutational isomers interfere with each other.

The Hamiltonian is invariant to arbitrary permutations of atoms of the
same element, and to E∗, the inversion of all coordinates through the space-
ﬁxed origin. Molecular energy levels may therefore be classiﬁed according
to irreducible representations (IR’s) of the Complete Nuclear Permutation-
Inversion (CNPI) group which is the direct product of the inversion group
and the group containing all possible permutations of identical nuclei. The
CNPI group is a true symmetry group of the full molecular Hamiltonian
in the absence of external ﬁelds, and the elements are usually referred to
as permutation-inversions (PI’s). The CNPI group grows in size factorially
with the number of equivalent nuclei, and rapidly becomes unwieldy. For-
tunately, Longuet-Higgins [10] showed that it is suﬃcient to consider the
subgroup of the CNPI group which contains only the PI’s associated with
barrierless processes and resolvable tunneling splittings. The associated re-
arrangement mechanisms are said to be feasible. For rigid molecules the MS
group, of order hRM, is isomorphic to the point group [11, 12], and all the
associated PI’s correspond to barrierless processes. Each rovibronic level is
hCNPI/hRM-fold degenerate because there are hCNPI/hRM distinct versions
on the PES [9] and each one supports an identical stack of energy levels.

A feasible rearrangement with a non-zero barrier leads to an enlarge-
ment of the MS group to include the new PI and all its products with the
PI’s of the rigid molecule MS group. Further feasible mechanisms are in-
cluded in a similar fashion. The resulting MS group is a subgroup of the
CNPI group obtained by removing all the PI’s for a given reference version
which are not feasible. The order of the MS group, hMS, and the order
of the CNPI group, hCNPI, must satisfy hCNPI/hMS = M , where M is an
integer. The versions are then divided into M disconnected sets. Each set
contains hMS/hRM distinct versions [9] all of which can be interconverted
by one or more feasible operations.

To a ﬁrst approximation the splitting pattern for any particular rovi-
bronic level can be obtained from wavefunctions written as linear combi-
nations of localized states which must transform according to IR’s of the
MS group. In this approach we apply degenerate perturbation theory to

REARRANGEMENTS IN WATER CLUSTERS

obtain a secular determinant whose eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are the
required tunneling states and their energies. Mixing between diﬀerent local-
ized states is neglected in this approximation. Since the localized wavefunc-
tions decay exponentially in the classically forbidden barrier regions it may
be reasonable to make a H¨uckel-type approximation including non-zero oﬀ-
diagonal matrix elements, β, only for minima which are directly connected
by a feasible rearrangement. Even if the tunneling matrix elements are un-
known it is still possible to deduce the likely splitting pattern along with
symmetry classiﬁcations and nuclear spin statistics. This procedure has
been automated using a computer program to calculate the reaction graph
from a minimal set of generator PI’s using double cosets [13] and similarity
transforms [14].

3. Classiﬁcation of Rearrangement Mechanisms

We deﬁne a degenerate rearrangement mechanism as one which links per-
mutational isomers of the same structure via a single transition state [15].
Here we follow Murrell and Laidler’s deﬁnition of a transition state as a
stationary point with a single negative Hessian eigenvalue [16]. The largest
tunneling splittings are expected for degenerate rearrangements (where the
localized states are in resonance) with low barriers, short paths and small
eﬀective masses. Degenerate rearrangements can in turn be divided into
two classes, namely symmetric degenerate rearrangements (SDR’s) where
the two sides of the path are related by a symmetry operation, and asym-
metric degenerate rearrangements (ADR’s) where they are not [17]. Most
of the rearrangements discussed in the following sections are ADR’s, which
is likely to cause problems in choosing the ﬁxed nodes for excited state
calculations in the diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) approach [18–21].

Recent experimental [22] and theoretical [23] studies of water trimer iso-
topomers both indicate that signiﬁcant tunneling splittings occur in these
species, even when the rearrangements involved are not strictly degener-
ate. (Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation the isotopomers have
the same PES, but the vibronic states are not in resonance between diﬀerent
wells.) We will also see in the following sections that tunneling splittings are
observed for (H2O)4 and (H2O)6 where no suitable degenerate rearrange-
ments have been found theoretically. In each case the tunneling may be the
result of a series of steps mediated by true transition states, or perhaps
even higher index saddles, where the end points are true permutational
isomers. We suggest the term ‘indirect tunneling’ to describe this situation
and distinguish it from ‘non-degenerate tunneling’ where the interaction is
between states belonging to diﬀerent structures.

4. Geometry Optimizations and Rearrangement Pathways

Eigenvector-following provides a powerful technique for locating minima
and transition states and calculating reaction pathways [24–29]. The precise
algorithms employed in the present work have been described in detail
elsewhere [30, 31]. The step for eigendirection i is

,

−

where bi is the corresponding Hessian eigenvalue and Fi is the component
of the gradient in this direction. A separate trust radius is employed for
each eigendirection by comparing the Hessian eigenvalue estimated from
the current and previous gradients with the true value. Analytic ﬁrst and
second derivatives of the energy were used at every step.

In the ab initio calculations these derivatives were mostly generated by
the CADPAC program [32], and Cartesian coordinates were used through-
out along with projection to remove overall rotation and translation [33,34].
Pathways were calculated by taking small displacements of 0.03 a0 away
from a transition state both parallel and antiparallel to the transition vec-
tor, and then employing eigenvector-following energy minimization to ﬁnd
the associated minimum. The pathways obtained by this procedure have
been compared to steepest-descent paths and pathways that incorporate a
kinetic metric [35] in previous work—the mechanism is generally found to
be correct [7]. Calculations employing rigid body intermolecular potentials
were performed using the ORIENT3 program [36–38], which contains the
same optimization package adapted for center-of-mass/orientational coor-
dinates. Some of the calculations in the present work employ the ASP rigid
water intermolecular potential of Millot and Stone [39] (somewhat modiﬁed
from the published version) and the much simpler but widely-used TIP4P
form [40, 41].

5. Water Dimer

The pioneering experiment of Dyke, Mack and Muenter [42] was followed by
many experimental and theoretical studies [43–45] of (H2O)2 and (D2O)2.
Dyke [46] classiﬁed the rovibronic energy levels in terms of permutation-
inversion group theory, and Coudert and Hougen used their internal-axis
method and an empirical intermolecular potential to analyze the tunneling
splittings theoretically [47–49]. A number of stationary points on the dimer
PES were characterized by Smith et al. [50], including three true transition
states. More recently the pathways corresponding to these three feasible
rearrangements have been characterized [8]. Since the group theory of the

‘Acceptor-tunneling’ path calculated for (H2O)2. The ﬁrst and last frames are
the two minima, the middle frame is the transition state and three additional frames on
each side of the path were selected to best illustrate the mechanism. A suitably scaled
transition vector is superimposed on the transition state; this displacement vector lies
parallel to the Hessian eigenvector corresponding to the unique negative eigenvalue.

water dimer is relatively well known, and has recently been summarized
with reference to the true pathways [8], details will be omitted here. Two
points of interest arise for the ‘acceptor tunneling’ pathway which leads
to the largest splittings. First, this pathway was found to correspond to a
‘methylamine-type’ process [51] rather than a rotation about the local C2
axis of the acceptor monomer (Figure 1) [8]. This result is in agreement
with the analysis of Pugliano et al. for the ground state acceptor tunneling
path based upon experiment [52].

6. Water Trimer

A ﬂurry of experimental and theoretical studies [53–56] followed the initial
FIR-VRT results of Pugliano and Saykally [57]. The energy level patterns
observed in the most recent FIR-VRT experiments correspond to an oblate
symmetric rotor with a large negative inertial defect, implying extensive
out-of-plane motion of the non-hydrogen-bonded hydrogens. These results
can be reconciled with the cyclic C1 symmetry global minimum found in
ab initio calculations [58, 59] by vibrational averaging over large amplitude
motions of the free (non-hydrogen-bonded) hydrogens on the timescale of
the FIR-VRT experiment.

The vibrational averaging which leads to the oblate symmetric top spec-
trum is caused by the facile single ﬂip mechanism. The corresponding tran-
sition state was probably ﬁrst characterized by Owicki et al. [60] for an
empirical potential. We have illustrated the mechanism before [5,7,59] and
readers are referred to these references for ﬁgures and a more detailed re-
view of the literature. The single ﬂip mechanism links each permutational
isomer to two others in cyclic sets of six, giving a secular problem analogous
to the π system of benzene [59, 61] with splitting pattern:

2βf (A1),

βf (E2),

βf (E1),

−

2βf (A2),

−

where βf is the tunneling matrix element for the ﬂip. The MS group has
order six and is isomorphic to C3h [57].

The rearrangement responsible for the regular quartet splittings ob-
served experimentally is probably the analogue of the ‘donor tunneling’
mechanism in the dimer, also known as ‘bifurcation tunneling’ because the
transition state includes a bifurcated, double acceptor, double-donor ar-
rangement [7]. When both the bifurcation mechanism and the single ﬂip
are feasible the MS group has order 48 [59]. However, there are six distinct
ways for the bifurcation to occur with accompanying ﬂips of neighbour-
ing monomers, and these give two distinct splitting patterns [7]. The most
recent experiments show that some of the quartets are further split by Cori-
olis coupling [62, 63]. Entirely regular quartets are found to be associated
with generators containing E∗ in the latter studies [7, 63].

A more detailed account of the above mechanisms, group theory and
quantum dynamics calculations can be found elsewhere [5, 7]. The analysis
of diﬀerent bifurcation and ﬂip mechanisms is considered in more detail
below for the water pentamer.

7. Water Tetramer

A symmetric doublet splitting of 5.6 MHz has been reported in two FIR-
VRT experiments for (D2O)4 [64, 65]. The cyclic global minimum of the

REARRANGEMENTS IN WATER CLUSTERS

7

tetramer has S4 symmetry [66–69] and lacks the ‘frustration’ exhibited
by the cyclic trimer and pentamer. Sch¨utz and coworkers found no true
transition states correpsonding to degenerate rearrangements in the tor-
sional space of the tetramer [70, 71]. A more systematic survey revealed
many more non-degenerate rearrangement mechanisms and just one true
degenerate rearrangement of the global minimum, which disappeared in
correlated calculations [72].

The eﬀective MS group is isomorphic to C2v for an overall quadruple
ﬂip [64] mediated by any pathway which gives the same eﬀective generator
PI [73]. There are at least three possible routes involving (1) a concerted
quadruple ﬂip (via an index four saddle), (2) true transition states and
local minima, or (3) index two saddles and local minima [70,72]. The split-
ting pattern for the only direct degenerate rearrangement found so far for
this cluster is more complex [72]. Four-dimensional quantum calculations of
torsional vibrational states with a model Hamiltonian suggest that a step-
wise pathway via the true transition states may contribute most to tunnel-
ing [74], but there are too many approximations involved for a deﬁnitive
conclusion to be drawn. The possibility appears to remain that the ob-
served splittings are due to ‘indirect tunneling’, as deﬁned in

8. Water Pentamer

The water pentamer exhibits a number of similarities to the trimer due to
the frustrated cyclic global minimum. The ﬁrst FIR-VRT results for (D2O)5
did not reveal any tunneling splittings [75]. However, analogues of the single
ﬂip and bifurcation mechanisms, described above for the trimer, have been
found along with a number of pathways connecting higher energy minima
[31,76]. Both the ﬂip and the bifurcation mechanism considered in isolation
produce an MS group of order 10 isomorphic to C5h with each version
connected to two others in a cyclic reaction graph containing 10 versions.
The predicted splitting pattern in the simplest H¨uckel approximation is the
same as for the π-system of 10-annulene (cyclodecapentaene):

where β is the appropriate tunneling matrix element, φ = (√5 + 1)/2 is
the golden ratio and φ−1 = (√5

parentheses are appropriate if the generator corresponds to the operation
S5 of C5h. If both the ﬂip and bifurcation mechanisms are feasible then
the MS group increases in dimension to order 320 and the splitting pattern
becomes rather complicated [31]. Qualitative estimates for the magnitude

of the splittings suggested that the ﬂip should lead to observable eﬀects
in both (H2O)5 and (D2O)5, while bifurcation tunneling might produce
splittings at the limit of current resolution [31]. The latest experimental
results appear to be in agreement with these predictions [77].

Since new experiments suggest that bifurcation tunneling splittings
might be resolvable for (H2O)5 we will now consider the group theory in
more detail to illustrate how such analyses are performed. The labelling
scheme and assignment of generator PI’s is illustrated for two possible bi-

10

D. J. WALES

furcation+ﬂip combinations in Figure 2. The labelling scheme in the ﬁgure
enables us to identify all the possible bifurcation/ﬂip processes which cor-
respond to degenerate rearrangements using the letters A–E to label the
ﬁve monomers. Here we exclude processes where the bifurcating monomer
also ﬂips. The bifurcation can occur at any of the ﬁve monomers, and in
each case the frustrated pair of neighbouring free hydrogens can appear on
any of the ﬁve edges. This gives a total of 25 bifurcation/ﬂip combinations.
Five of the resulting generators are self-inverse while the other twenty fall
into non-self-inverse pairs to give a total of 15 distinct mechanisms (Ta-
ble 1). For the same labelling scheme the generator for the single ﬂip is
(ABCDE)(13579)(246810)* with inverse (AEDCB)(19753)(210864)*.

Previously we identiﬁed two splitting patterns for diﬀerent bifurca-
tion/ﬂip combinations in the pentamer, and labelled these A and B. In
the present systematic analysis a third splitting pattern, type C, emerges,
as shown in Table 2. All 15 combinations result in the same MS group,
G(320), described previously [31]. The C-type pattern occurs for the ﬁve
generators of the form (ij)∗; for the trimer such generators also correspond
to one particular splitting pattern [7]. The A-type pattern is found for the
bifurcation accompanied by zero or three ﬂips and the B-type pattern is
found for the bifurcation accompanied by one or two ﬂips (Table 1). All
three patterns include four sets of ten lines and two sets of eight; they all
involve irregular submultiplets. In the C pattern every energy level λ has a
λ (and opposite parity with respect to E∗), implying
partner with energy
that there are no odd-membered rings in the reaction graph [78]. The split-
tings within each manifold with a constant coeﬃcient of βf (the tunneling
matrix element for the ﬂip) also obey an approximate pairing rule.

9. Water Hexamer

On the basis of an isotope mixture test Liu et al. [79] have assigned a VRT
band of (H2O)6 at 83 cm−1. For this cluster a number of diﬀerent structures
lie rather close in energy, with the four lowest energy isomers reported by
Tsai and Jordan separated by only about 100 cm−1 [80]. The most accurate
ab initio calculations performed to date suggest that a ‘cage’ structure lies
lowest, followed closely by ‘prism’ and ‘book’ forms [81]. The assignment
of the experimental spectrum to the cage isomer was made on the basis of
DMC calculations of the vibrationally averaged rotational constants [79]. It
has been suggested [79] that a single structure is observed because the clus-
ters have very low internal temperatures (around 5 K) under experimental
conditions. However, each experimental line is split into a triplet with in-
tensity ratio 9:6:1 and separation 1.92 MHz. Liu et al. have explained how
this pattern might arise from two hypothetical degenerate rearrangements

of monomers in similar chemical environments [79]. However, no low-lying
degenerate rearrangements have been found in studies employing both em-
pirical and ab initio calculations [8, 82, 83]. Four isomers of the cage have
been found independently with very similar ASP-type potentials [8, 82, 83]
and checked in ab initio calculations [82,83]. Flip and bifurcation rearrange-
ments of the terminal single-donor, single-acceptor monomers exist which
interconvert 16 versions of the cage structure, including four versions of
each low-lying isomer [8]. Two examples are shown in Figures 3 and 4.

The resulting MS group can be found by considering the eﬀective gen-
erators for combinations of ﬂip and bifurcation processes which together
result in a permutation of the same structure [73]. The same group is ob-
tained for all four of the cage isomers; it contains four elements and is
isomorphic to C2v [8]. The eﬀective reaction graph for one of the four cage
isomers is shown in Figure 5. The four versions are connected in a cyclic

where the symmetry labels are appropriate for a particular correspondence
between the PI’s and the elements of C2v [8]. The accidental degeneracy
of the A2 and B1 states would be broken at higher resolution because
the β matrix elements connecting the four versions of each isomer are all
slightly diﬀerent. The relative nuclear spin weights for rovibronic states are
9:3:3:1 for (H2O)6 and 4:2:2:1 for (D2O)6 corresponding to A1:A2:B1:B2. If
the accidental degeneracy is unresolved then the relative intensities of the
three triplet components would be 9:6:1 for (H2O)6 and 4:4:1 for (D2O)6.
This result is equivalent to that obtained by Liu et al. [79] but does not
require the existence of any hypothetical mechanisms. A similar analysis

holds for all four cage isomers. However, if this explanation is correct then it
seems likely that all four cage isomers would be present under experimental
conditions, which seems to be incompatible with the interpretation of the
spectrum in terms of a single isomer [79]. Unless low energy degenerate
rearrangements of the cage isomers are found the above ‘indirect tunneling’
mechanism seems to be the most plausible explanation that theory can
provide.

Two-dimensional quantum calculations of torsional vibrational states
for the single-acceptor, single-donor monomers have also been carried out
[8]. The other four monomers are held ﬁxed in this model. Both TIP4P
[40, 41] and ASP potentials [39] were considered. For TIP4P all the wave-
functions were delocalized over the torsional degrees of freedom of the two
monomers. However, for the ASP potential the ground state was found to be
localized, in agreement with DMC calculations of Gregory and Clary [83].
The latter result appears to be incompatible with the experimental ob-
servation of tunneling splittings. However, the two-dimensional calculation
suggests that there exist low-lying vibrational states which are delocalized
over more than one cage isomer. More details, along with illustrations of
the wavefunctions, can be found elsewhere [8]. These results provide a clear
illustration of how tunneling splittings can be sensitive to the excitation of
particular vibrational modes. Since experiment measures the diﬀerence be-
tween ground and excited state splittings a direct comparison with theory
is often diﬃcult.

Abstract

Energy spectra and angular distributions have been measured of electrons
that are emitted upon disassembly of Xe150000 following irradiation by intense
(1015-1016 W cm−2) laser pulses whose durations are varied over the 100-2200
fs range. The cluster explosion dynamics occur in the hydrodynamic regime.
Electron emission is found to be unexpectedly asymmetric and exhibits a res-
onance when the laser pulse duration is ∼1 ps. These results are rationalized
by extending the hydrodynamic model to also take into account the force
that the light ﬁeld exerts on the polarization charge that is induced on sur-
face of the cluster. We show that the magnitude of this electrostrictive force
is comparable to those of Coulombic and the hydrodynamic forces, and it
exhibits resonance behavior. Contrary to earlier understanding, we ﬁnd that
low-energy electrons are connected to the resonance in energy absorption by
the cluster. The high-energy electrons seem to be produced by a mechanism
that is not so strongly inﬂuenced by the resonance.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ready availability of intense, ultrashort laser sources has driven widespread interest in
the response of various forms of matter to intense light. The focus of the bulk of con-
temporary research has been either on dynamics involving low-density matter, in the form
of isolated atoms or molecules, or on interactions that involve high-density matter in the
form of solids. Investigations have lead to the discovery of several fundamental phenomena
in both types of matter, and many avenues for technological applications have opened up.
Gas-phase clusters are uniquely placed between the two density regimes. The large local
density in a cluster gives rise to solid-like behavior but, at the same time, sizes of clusters are
small enough to ensure that atomic and molecular eﬀects do not lose their relevance. This
co-mingling of two separate aspects of laser-matter interaction is one of the main reasons for
growing interest in the fundamental aspects of the physics of cluster dynamics in intense laser
ﬁelds. Another, very important facet of laser-cluster interactions that has fueled research
in the ﬁeld is the discovery of the extraordinarily high eﬃciency with which large rare-gas
clusters absorb laser energy [1] and subsequently redistribute it into high energy ions [2],
electrons [3,4], and photons [5]. The eﬃcient conversion of laser energy into high energy
particles and radiation has many important implications from the viewpoint of applications.
The more notable among these are coherent radiation in the x-ray regime through high-
harmonic generation [6], intense incoherent x-rays emitted by hot plasmas [7], high-energy
electrons by laser wakeﬁeld acceleration [8], and, recently, generation of ultrashort pulses
of monoenergetic neutrons from nuclear fusion in cluster plasmas [9]. Moreover, there are
a plethora of other potential applications in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, time-
resolved neutron diﬀraction, and table-top accelerators that await exploitation. However,
despite the fundamental importance of laser-cluster interactions, and many tantalizing ap-
plications, proper insight into the dynamics of energy absorption and redistribution remains
elusive. The complexity of the interaction necessitates the use of various approximations
in modeling observations. Experimental and theoretical investigations continue to remain
necessary in order to verify the validity of diﬀerent schemes.

There exist two major theoretical models that seek to explain the evolution of the cluster
under intense ﬁeld irradiation. Neither of them, the hydrodynamic expansion model or the
ionization ignition - Coulomb explosion model, can adequately explain the experimentally
observed features that presently drive research in this area. In both models, atoms in a clus-
ter are tunnel ionized at the leading edge of the incident laser pulse. As the ionized electrons
are removed from the cluster, what gets left behind is a positively charged core that gives rise
to an increasing potential barrier to further removal of electrons. The question of whether
the barrier is suﬃcient to retain a large fraction of electrons or not is the bone of contention
between the two models. In the hydrodynamic expansion model, it is assumed that retention
of most of the electrons by the cluster results in a spherically symmetric plasma. The re-
tained electrons absorb energy from the laser by collisional inverse bremsstrahlung. The hot
electron plasma expands due to hydrodynamic pressure, and transfers energy to the ions.
The expansion velocity of the plasma is determined by the plasma sound speed, and since
the ion and electron charge clouds expand at the same speed, the ions are expected to be
signiﬁcantly hotter than the electrons. On the other hand, the Coulomb explosion-ionization
ignition model of the dynamics avers that electrons leave the cluster rapidly after tunnel

2

ionization. As a result, there is a build-up of charge on the cluster that gives rise to a radial
ﬁeld that can be large enough to drive further ionization at the surface of the sphere. The
removal of these electrons increases the radial ﬁeld further and “ignites” ionization. The
cluster then explodes due to the Coulombic repulsion between the positively charged ions.
At the most basic level, prevailing wisdom indicates that the hydrodynamic expansion model
is expected to hold for clusters that are large enough in size to retain a substantial fraction
of the electrons, while the ionization ignition-Coulomb explosion model requires the prompt
removal of most of the electrons, which would be the case for small clusters. In this paper
we focus attention on the hydrodynamic expansion interpretation of cluster laser dynamics
as our experiments are concerned with large clusters of xenon, Xen (n ∼150000).

Although the hydrodynamic expansion model [10] remains the most successful eﬀort
at quantitative description of the interaction of large clusters with intense laser ﬁelds, it is,
nevertheless, recognized that the model has shortcomings; some attempts have recently been
made to improve upon it [11,12]. Due to the complexity of the problem, the original model,
as well as various modiﬁcations, have hitherto assumed that the plasma evolution occurs in
spherically symmetry fashion. However, spherical symmetry has raised problems when the
model has been sought to be used in order to provide adequate quantitative descriptions of
the dynamics that give rise to the pronounced asymmetry that is experimentally observed
in the energy spectra of emitted ions following cluster disassembly [13,14]. Results of these
experiments have shown that asymmetric emission of the fastest (most energetic) ions is
closely linked to the eﬃciency of energy absorption in the cluster, and that a resonance
in the latter leads to enhancement of the former. By measuring ion energies both along
and perpendicular to the laser polarization vector as a function of pulse duration, it has
been shown that ion energies show a resonance at a particular value of laser pulse duration
cluster and, somewhat unexpectedly, that the disassembly of the Xe150000 cluster is most
asymmetric when the mean ion energy is maximum. In order to account for this unexpected
result, an extension has been proposed of the hydrodynamic model [14] that takes cognizance
of the force that the light ﬁeld exerts on the induced polarization charge on the surface of
the cluster. It has been shown that the magnitude of this force can be comparable to the
Coulombic and hydrodynamic forces, and that it also shows resonance-like behavior. It can,
thus, cause an asymmetry in the ion emission with the observed characteristics.

The polarization force that has been proposed to rationalize the asymmetry of the high
energy ions should also inﬂuence the energy spectrum, and the angular distribution, of the
electrons that are ejected from the cluster upon its disassembly. We present in the following
experimental data to show that this is, indeed, the case. There has been only one previously
reported study of electron emission from large clusters that explode in the hydrodynamic
expansion regime [3] that, in discussing low-and high-energy components in the electron
energy distribution, have a direct bearing on the questions of resonance and asymmetry
that we address in this paper. Surprisingly, contrary to what might be expected on the
basis of this earlier measurement of the electron energy spectrum [3], we ﬁnd that low-
energy electrons are connected to the resonance in the energy absorption. The high-energy
electrons seem to be produced by a mechanism that is not inﬂuenced by the resonance.
In the course of this work, another report has appeared [4] in which results are presented
that indicate that the high energy component might extend to values as high as 500 keV
when argon and xenon clusters are irradiated by laser intensities that are in the 1017 W

3

cm−2 range. We discuss our explanation of the electron data in the context of recently
developed understanding of the role of resonance in determining electron and ion energy
distributions. Both the experimental data and the proposed extension of the hydrodynamic
model emphasize the need for a two-dimensional description of the dynamics of cluster-laser
interaction that treats the charge and the ﬁeld distributions in self-consistent fashion.

II. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

Our experimental setup is similar to the one described recently [13,15], with some mod-

solenoid-driven pulsed nozzle with a 500 µm throat diameter, and the centerline beam was
transfered to a high vacuum chamber via a 55◦ nickel skimmer with a 250 µm diameter
aperture. Xenon cluster sizes were estimated using Hagena’s scaling law [16]. A dual mi-
crochannel plate (MCP) assembly was used at the end of a 19 cm time-of-ﬂight (TOF)
spectrometer to detect the ions and the electrons. Ion energies were determined by convert-
ing the ﬁeld-free ion time-of-ﬂight to energy. Electron energies were measured by scanning
the voltage on a retarding potential analyzer from zero to -5 kV, integrating the signal near
t = 0 over time, and then diﬀerentiating the yield thus obtained with respect to the voltage.
The MCP signal was recorded using a 500 MHz, 1 GS s−1 digital oscilloscope.

The Ti:sapphire laser used can generate 55 mJ per pulse, with 100 fs pulsewidth, but only
upto 12 mJ was used for this series of experiments. With 100 fs pulses, typical intensities that
were accessed in this series of experiments covered the range 1014 - 1016 W cm−2. The pulse
duration of the laser was varied by changing the grating separation in the compressor. The
actual pulse duration was measured using an second-harmonic generation autocorrelator
located just outside the vacuum chamber. At the intensities used here, we did not ﬁnd
appreciable eﬀects of chirp on the results that are presented below. The laser pulse energy
was kept constant for these measurements; hence, the intensity falls linearly as the pulse
duration is increased. While this procedure does imply that two variables - the pulse duration
and the laser intensity - are simultaneously changed, it is known that the dependence of
energy absorption on intensity is not very strong [17]. Moreover, earlier experimental work
[14] has shown that the existence of a maximum in the ion energy as the laser intensity
is reduced. This strengthens the case for the importance of the pulse duration, and, by
implication, of the resonance that has been observed in ion energy spectra.

III. ROLE OF RESONANCE IN THE HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL

Before we present the results of our experiments on electron emission upon disassembly
of large xenon clusters, it is pertinent to brieﬂy review the role of resonance in attempts
that seek to rationalize the observed asymmetries in ion emission in the case of Xe150000
clusters at laser intensities in the 1016 W cm−2 range [14]. Our electron data can then
be properly placed in the context of the most recent developments of the hydrodynamic
expansion model.

Laser energy is deposited into the cluster through inverse bremsstrahlung. The hydro-
dynamic model assumes that the cluster can be described as a uniform and isotropic plasma

is placed in a uniform, external electric ﬁeld, it is known that the application of the ﬁeld
polarizes the medium, and alters the ﬁeld in and around the sphere (see Fig. 2). Under the
assumption of spherical symmetry, together with the Drude approximation for the dielectric
constant of the plasma, the electric ﬁeld distribution inside and outside the sphere can be
found using the Laplace equation with appropriate boundary conditions. Furthermore, if
we assume that the plasma dimensions are much smaller than the wavelength of the laser
light (780 nm, in our case, compared to Xe-cluster sizes that are on the order of 10 nm),
the electric ﬁeld can be taken to be uniform over the entire cluster and the problem can be
analytically solved. The solution is available in several textbooks on electromagnetic theory
[18]. For an applied electric ﬁeld, Eoeiωt, and a dielectric constant, ǫ, the electric ﬁeld within
the dielectric sphere, Ein(r), and outside it, Eout(r), can be expressed, respectively, as

Ein(r) =

ǫ + 2

Eout(r) =

!

These ﬁelds are the sum of the applied ﬁeld and the ﬁeld due to an induced dipole on the
dielectric sphere. It is known that for all homogeneous ellipsoids, the ﬁeld inside is uniform,
and this is reﬂected in the expression for Ein(r). An induced surface polarization charge
produces the dipole ﬁeld; the corresponding charge density, σpol, is

σpol =

4π (cid:18)

ǫ − 1
ǫ + 2 (cid:19)

Eoeiωtcos(θ).

We note that ǫ in these equation represents a complex quantity, and hence the ﬁelds and the
surface charge density are not in phase with the applied laser ﬁeld. The description of the
cluster plasma in terms of these is valid only for a rigid dielectric sphere - the deformation
of the sphere due to electrostrictive forces has been not been considered. The pressure on
the surface can be estimated by calculating the force that is exerted on a surface element by
multiplying the charge density by the electric ﬁeld at that point. We took care to exclude
the ﬁeld due to the charge element itself by taking the average of the ﬁelds on the two sides
of the surface element as the eﬀective ﬁeld. The charge on the surface element makes equal
but opposite contributions to the ﬁelds on the two sides, and the averaging removes this
contribution from the ﬁeld. The cycle-averaged force calculated in this manner is

Using the expression for the electric ﬁeld within the cluster, that the rate of energy deposition
by an applied ﬁeld is expressed as

The absorption of laser energy by the cluster goes through a resonance at Re(ǫ) = -2, where
the ﬁeld inside the cluster reaches a maximum value (see Fig. 3). The ﬁgure also shows that

the polarization-dependent pressure also exhibits similar, resonance-like behavior, although
at a slightly shifted value of ǫ. Large negative values of Re(ǫ) correspond to large electron
densities, which are present in the early part of the laser pulse. As time evolves and the
cluster expands, the electron density falls and the real part of the dielectric constant, which
initially has large negative values (Fig. 3), approaches -2 where both the electric ﬁeld within
the sphere and the rate of energy absorption, are resonantly enhanced. The functional
dependences shown in Fig. 3 are for a laser intensity of 1×1015 W cm−2; the imaginary part
of ǫ was chosen such that the electric ﬁeld was enhanced 5-fold at resonance.

It is of interest to compare the magnitude of the electrostrictive pressure due to the
applied laser ﬁeld with typical Coulombic and hydrodynamic pressures. In order to extract
some quantitative insight, we used the same plasma parameters as were earlier considered
by Ditmire et al. [10]: the electron density was taken to be 5.4 × 1021 cm3 (which is three
times the critical density for 800 nm light), the temperature was assumed to be 1 keV,
the radius of the cluster plasma was 100 ˚A, and the total charge on the cluster was 105.
Under these conditions, both the Coulombic pressure and the hydrodynamic pressure have
a magnitude of ∼3×1011 N m−2. It is therefore clear that the polarization pressure that we
discuss above, values of which are on the same order of magnitude (see Fig. 3), does, indeed,
contribute to the expansion dynamics of the cluster plasma. As such, the contribution of
the polarization pressure must be included in any realistic modeling of the evolution of the
system. Consideration of this pressure has been shown to qualitative explain the asymmetric
ion emission that occurs upon disassembly of Xe150000 clusters upon irradiation by laser light
of intensity 1016 W cm−2 [14].

We note that the polarization pressure survives cycle averaging, and is directed outwards
from the sphere (the pressure is positive) over a large range of values for the real part of
ǫ. As shown in Fig. 3, even in the region where this pressure does become negative, its
magnitude remains small in comparison with the positive pressure near the resonance. The
pressure also acts on the entire cluster plasma, causing both the ionic and the electronic
components to expand asymmetrically. This actually follows from a built-in assumption in
the model: the ions and the electrons are uniformly distributed and occupy the same volume
at all points of time. The only exception is that the electrons are allowed to free-stream out
of the cluster if they have suﬃcient energy. But once free, these electrons are no longer part
of the dielectric plasma described by the equations that we have considered so far.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 4 shows a typical, raw MCP signal corresponding to the electrons emitted by the
cluster in our experiments. The waveform was recorded using a 500 MHz, 1 GS s−1 digital
storage oscilloscope. The front end of the MCP was kept at 500 V for this measurement.
The zero on the time scale was determined by measuring the arrival time of the laser pulse
with a fast photodiode. Three distinct features, marked A, B and C, are clearly seen in the
signal. The dip in the MCP output that is marked A is the fastest signal that can readily
be distinguished from noise. It occurs within a couple of nanoseconds after the arrival of
the laser pulse. This signal could be either due to very fast electrons, possessing energies
in excess of 10 keV, or to photons that are either emitted or scattered by the clusters.
As discussed in the following, it was not possible for us to distinguish between these two

6

possibilities in totally unambiguous fashion in the present experimental setup. Feature B,
on the other hand, is known to be the signal from electrons that possess energies up to 5
keV. We shall refer to this as the peak that is due to “warm electrons”. All measurements
of electron yield and asymmetry that are reported in the following pertain to the integrated
signal of peaks A and B. Feature C in Fig. 4 is due to imperfect impedance matching
between the detector and the oscilloscope that gives rise to “ringing” in the electron signal.
Electrons with a few keV kinetic energy are too fast for time-of-ﬂight measurement.
Here we make use of the retarding potential energy analyzer (RPA) that is placed before
the detector at the end of our time-of-ﬂight spectrometer in order to obtain electron energy
spectra. As the (negative) voltage on the RPA is increased, the integrated electron signal is
measured at each voltage. Since the RPA rejects all electrons with energy less the applied
voltage, VRP , the measured signal is given by

SM CP (VRP ) =

f (V )dV.

The actual distribution of electron energies f (V ) can then be obtained by simply diﬀeren-
tiating the integrated electron signal with respect to V. Figure 5 shows an electron energy
spectrum obtained by this method for Xe25000 clusters irradiated by laser light of intensity
8×1015 W cm−2. The polarization vector of the incident light was directed along the axis
of our time-of-ﬂight spectrometer. We note that a single temperature of 700 eV adequately
describes the electron energy proﬁle in this case. The fast peak designated A in Fig. 4 could
not be resolved in these experiments with as much as -5 kV applied on the RPA. If the
A-peak is to be attributed to the “hot electrons” peak that was detected in the spectrum
reported by Shao al. [3], then data shown in Fig. 5 indicate that the electron energy would
have to be much larger than the 2-3 keV that they claimed. This might be due to the
fact that the experiments conducted by Shao et al. were on much smaller Xen clusters,
comprising ∼2000 atoms.

In the case of clusters of larger size, such as Xe150000, the integrated electron yields that
we measured as a function of RPA voltage are shown in Fig. 6 for two, mutually orthogonal,
laser polarization directions. The actual spectrum can be obtained by diﬀerentiating such
a data set, but the procedure is prone to amplifying noise, and hence raw, undiﬀerentiated
data is shown. Unlike in Fig. 5, in Fig. 6 it is possible to discern the distribution of electrons
between the “hot” and the “warm” peaks. For instance, the integrated yield of electrons
above 5 keV energy (with some fraction of this contribution coming from photons) is given
by the data point at the far right of the diagram, which is approximately 3 units on the
arbitrary scale. The integrated yield above 500 eV is represented by the data point on the
far left of the diagram, and this is about 14 units. Thus the “hot” electrons constitute 20%,
or less, of the total electron emission from the cluster along the laser polarization vector.
By the same argument, the fraction for the perpendicular direction is about 50%. On
rotating the light polarization vector by 90◦ in our experiments, we found that the fast peak
remains unchanged, while the warm electrons are considerably reduced in intensity. This in
line with expectations of the modiﬁed hydrodynamic model that we discussed above, and
lends support to our attribution of the peak to “warm” electrons. We note the disagreement
between our data and the only prior report on electron spectra [3] in which the warm electron
yield seemed to go to zero when the laser polarization was in the perpendicular direction.

7

In order to probe the inﬂuence of the resonance and the electrostrictive force on the
electron spectrum, we recorded the electron as the laser pulse duration was varied. We
show in Fig. 7 typical MCP output pulses measured with diﬀerent values of laser pulse
duration that cover the range from 200 fs to 2.1 ps. We note that there is only marginal
variation in the amplitude of peak A. On the other hand, the amplitude of peak B shows
very substantial variations as the laser pulse duration is altered. This facet of our results
is shown more clearly in the dependence we measure of the integrated electron yields on
laser pulse duration, as shown in Fig. 8 for two, mutually orthogonal, laser polarization
directions. A distinct resonance is observed when the laser pulse duration is ∼1.2 ps in the
case when the laser polarization is parallel to the spectrometer axis. We measure a six-fold
increase in the electron yield at resonance. The dependence for perpendicular polarization is
much weaker. The asymmetry in the electron emission, measured as the diﬀerence between
the yields obtained with parallel and perpendicular polarizations, also shows a resonance in
much the same fashion that the corresponding asymmetry in ion emission did [14].

As noted above, analysis of the MCP outputs (of the type shown in Fig. 7) at diﬀerent
values of pulse duration makes clear that the resonance in energy absorption is connected
to the warm electrons, and not to the hot ones.
In fact the hot electron yield seems to
be relatively weakly dependent on the pulse duration. While this observation is in good
agreement with the expectations from the electrostrictive force discussed above, it is in
strong disagreement with the explanation oﬀered by Shao et al. [3] for their electron data.
They postulate that it is the extensive collisional heating of the plasma that produces the
hot electrons during resonance, and that this heating process makes the angular distribution
isotropic. On the other hand, the warm electrons are postulated to undergo a limited
number of collisions. Hence, they retain the signature of above-threshold ionization (ATI)
in their angular distribution which is known to produce a narrow distribution of electrons
peaked along the laser polarization vector. Clearly, our experimental data rule out such an
interpretation. With the inclusion of the electrostrictive force, the observed variation with
pulsewidth of the warm electrons is no longer unexpected. The resonance not only heats up
the electrons, it also provides an additional, asymmetric lowering of the barrier that holds
the electrons to the cluster. If the electron energy distribution is independent of position in
the cluster, it is much more likely that a polar electron will free-stream out of the cluster
rather than an equatorial one. Hence the asymmetry in the warm electron distribution is
not a remnant of ATI, but a result of the asymmetry in the barrier that the electrons must
overcome in order to leave the cluster!

The interpretation of the “warm” electron component that we oﬀer on the basis of our
data, and of the modiﬁed hydrodynamic expansion model that we have discussed, leaves
unanswered the question of the “hot” electrons. Since “hot” electron production is no longer
strongly associated with the resonance, new mechanisms must be found to explain both the
energy and the angular distribution of these electrons. While the observed symmetry is
probably due to the fact that these electrons have enough energy to free-stream directly
from the interior of the cluster without requiring the binding potential to be lowered by
the electrostrictive force, the source of these high-energy electrons remains to be discovered.
We note here that it is somewhat surprising that a large fraction of electrons should remain
unaﬀected by a large change in the pulse duration since the evolution of the cluster seems to
be inﬂuenced very strongly by the position of the resonance. In particular, the “fast” peak

8

seems to remain unaltered as the pulse duration is increased well beyond the optimum value
of 1.2 ps (in the case of Xe150000), where not only is the peak intensity lower but the cluster
has also expanded into a low density plasma before the peak light intensity is reached. This
leads us to the very real possibility that the fast peak in our measurements of MCP signals
consists of a not-insubstantial fraction of photons, which would automatically be isotropic.
In the context of the two-dimensional hydrodynamic expansion, we note that one im-
portant diﬀerence between the forces acting upon the electrons and the ions in the cluster
disassembly process lies in the directional properties of the diﬀerent forces. While all the
forces (Coulombic, hydrodynamic and electrostrictive) act outwards for positively-charged
ions, the Coulomb force is directed inwards for the electrons. Consequently, in the case of
electrons, the Coulombic force tends to counterbalance the eﬀect of the other two forces.
Due to the partial cancelation of the symmetric forces for the electrons, the inﬂuence of the
asymmetric electrostrictive force should be seen more strongly in the electron than in the
ion spectrum. This certainly seems to be borne out in the results of our experiments. For
the same reason, the electron free-streaming rate should also be strongly modulated in favor
of emission along the laser polarization vector.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the dynamics of Xe150000 disassembly following irradiation by intense
laser pulses whose duration is varied over the range from 200 fs to 2200 fs, with intensities in
the range of 1015 - 1016 W cm−2. The clusters are large enough for the explosion dynamics
to occur in the hydrodynamic regime. Earlier work [14] had established that the emission
of high energy ions from such clusters is distinctly asymmetric. In order to account for this
unexpected result, an extension of the hydrodynamic model was suggested that included the
force that the light ﬁeld exerts on the polarization charge that is induced on the surface of
the cluster. It was shown that the magnitude of this force can be comparable to Coulombic
and the hydrodynamic forces, and that the force also exhibits resonance-like behaviour. It
can, thus, cause an asymmetry in the ion emission with the observed characteristics. Such a
polarization force would also be expected to inﬂuence the energy spectrum and the angular
distribution of the electrons ejected from the cluster, and we have presented experimental
data here to show that this is, indeed, the case.

In addition to providing data that adds veracity to the extension of the hydrodynamic
model that has been proposed, our data also has some surprising facets. Contrary to earlier
understanding of the electron energy spectrum, albeit established on the basis of one reported
experiment [3], we ﬁnd that low-energy electrons are connected to the resonance in the
energy absorption. The high-energy electrons seem to be produced by a mechanism that
is not as strongly inﬂuenced by the resonance. We have placed our electron data in the
context of recently proposed understanding of the role of resonance in determining electron
and ion energy distributions. Both the experimental data and the proposed extension of the
hydrodynamic model emphasize the need for a two-dimensional description of the dynamics
of cluster-laser interaction that treats the charge and the ﬁeld distributions self-consistently.
The results presented here underscore the need for more sophisticated treatments that do
not rely on spherical symmetry and uniform density of the plasma. Both these assumptions
have been used frequently, largely because of the diﬃculty involved in doing away with

9

them. Not only does our data directly question the appropriateness of the ﬁrst assumption,
the mechanism we have proposed here to explain our data is believed to be a ﬁrst step
towards a treatment that can deal with non-uniform charge distribution. A two-dimensional
treatment, with self-consistent ﬁeld and charge distribution, seems to be necessary for a
satisfactory description of the dynamics. Milchberg et al., who propose a self-consistent
one-dimensional radial hydrodynamic model have made an attempt in this direction [12].

The possibility of simultaneous maximization of ion and electron energies, and asym-
metry in the emission, may have profound implications. For instance, if the emission of
deuterium ions can be made signiﬁcantly anisotropic, the yield of fusion neutrons should
become signiﬁcantly higher due to a larger probability of energetic collisions [9]. The direc-
tionality would also be useful in schemes for using cluster plasmas as sources of energetic
highly charged ions. Even in applications where the primary interest is in the photons,
for instance in EUV lithography, the ability to direct electrons and ions away from critical
components should allow a reduction in damage due to energetic particle impact.

FIG. 1. Schematic representation of the experimental apparatus for the measurement of
electron spectra. HV: High voltage supply for the retarding potential analyzer, DAC: Digi-
tal-to-Analog-Convertor, DSO: Digital Storage Oscilloscope, GPIB: General Purpose Interface
Board.

FIG. 2. In the standard hydrodynamic expansion model, Xe150000 wold be assumed to be a
spherical plasma that can be treated as a homogeneous sphere, placed in a uniform, time-dependent
electric ﬁeld. The application of the external ﬁeld polarizes the sphere, and alters the ﬁeld in and
around the sphere (see text).

FIG. 3. The variation with Re(ǫ) of the electric ﬁeld within the dielectric sphere, Ein, and the
polarization pressure, Ppol. The value of ǫ was chosen so as to produce a ﬁvefold enhancement of
the electric ﬁeld at resonance. Im(ǫ) was held constant. The laser intensity was 1×1015 W cm−2
(see text).

FIG. 4. Raw output signal from the microchannel plate (MCP) detector near the laser arrival

time (t=0). See the text for discussion of the features identiﬁed as A, B, and C.

FIG. 5. Electron energy spectrum from disassembly of Xe25000 clusters upon irradiation by 100
fs laser pulses of peak intensity 8×1015 W cm−2. The laser polarization vector was along the axis
of the time-of-ﬂight spectometer.

FIG. 6. Integrated electron yield from Xe150000 as a function of retarding potential on the
energy analyzer. The signal for perpendicular polarization has been multiplied by a factor of 2.
T1 and T2 are the results of two-temprature ﬁts to the data.

FIG. 7. MCP signals for electrons for diﬀerent values of laser pulse duration covering the range
from 200 fs to 1200 fs. The laser intensity at 200 fs was 8×1015 W cm−2 and the laser polarization
was along the axis of the TOF spectrometer.

FIG. 8. Integrated electron yield as a function of laser pulse duration for laser polarization

direction that is parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the TOF spectrometer.

Abstract

We have performed classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) stud-
ies of electron capture and ionization in multiply charged (Q ≤ 8)
ion-Rydberg atom collisions at intermediate impact velocities. Im-
pact parallel to the minor and to the major axis, respectively, of
the initial Kepler electron ellipse has been investigated. The im-
portant role of the initial electron momentum distribution found for
singly charged ion impact is strongly disminished for higher projec-
tile charge, while the initial spatial distribution remains important
for all values of Q studied.

The use of coherent elliptical Rydberg states in ion-atom collision studies (for
recent papers on the subject cf. [1-3] and references therein) has not only aided
the intuitive understanding of the interaction dynamics , it also illuminates the
roles of the momentum and the spatial distributions of the target electron states.
In classical terms, the momentum distribution can be widely varied simply by
changing the eccentricity ε of the Rydberg ellipse without aﬀecting the energy of
the state. In particular, for impact perpendicular to the major axis of the ellipse,
the capture cross section displays a maximum if vp (the perihelion electron ve-
locity) is parallel and equal to the projectile velocity v; this is believed to be due
to the matching electron momenta in the initial target and the ﬁnal projectile
state. In contrast, the role of the spatial distribution becomes most clearly visible
if the impact velocity vector in adjusted perpendicular to the minor axis of the
Rydberg ellipse; in this case, the electrons can be located either between the ap-
proaching ion and the target nucleus (”upstream geometry”) or behind the target
nucleus, as seen from the projectile (”downstream geometry”) without otherwise
changing the momentum distribution of the Rydberg state (i.e., its angular mo-
mentum l and the principal quantum number n). The capture cross section in
both cases turns out to be quite diﬀerent: it is much larger in the upstream case
as compared to the downstream case; apparently, in the corresponding region of
parameter space the spatial characteristics of the initial state determine the out-
come of the collision. These investigations have so far been restricted to collisions
with singly charged ions. Recently, however, it has become possible to employ
such targets in studies involving multiply charged ions [1,4]. In another context
(electron capture by multiply charged ion in the presence of an external magnetic
ﬁeld) we have found indications [5] that for increasing projectile charge Q the dis-

1

tortion of the initial state increasingly dominates over the inﬂuence of diﬀerent
target electron distributions; we have therefore performed an exploratory study
of such systems which is the topic of this Letter.

We employ the classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) method which is
quite useful in particular for the description of quantum mechanically complex
systems, giving a good qualitative and often fairly quantitative agreement with
experimental data ( for more recent applications to the study of Rydberg atom
collisions cf., e.g., [1-3]). Structureless ions of charge Q between 1 and 8 col-
lide with Rydberg target atoms with nuclear charge q=1 and principal quantum
number n = 25. The geometry is chosen such that the direction of impact is
perpendicular to the angular momentum direction of the Kepler ellipse. Specif-
ically, two cases are studied: (i) the impact is parallel to the minor axis, thus
allowing to study the velocity matching phenomenon, and (ii) impact parallel to
the major axis, showing the eﬀect of the spatial orientation of the target elec-
tron (”upstream-downstream asymmetry”). A useful quantity characterizing the
electron orbit is the (generalized) eccentricity ε = ±q1 − (l/n)2. In case (i), the
+ sign identiﬁes orbits with the perihelion velocity vp parallel (-, antiparallel)
to v; in case (ii) it characterizes the upstream (-, downstream) geometry. The
impact velocity v is scaled by 1/n, the velocity of a circular Rydberg state, i.e.,
V = vn = 1 in this case; the number of MC cycles was adjusted to obtain sta-
tistical uncertainties of less than 5%. Care has been taken to assure that the
projectile starts suﬃciently far from the target (approximately 3.5 × 105 atomic
units a.u.) to correctly describe the initial part of the trajectory; in view of the
long range Coulomb potential and the known sensitivity of Rydberg states to
l, m changing processes, this is critical particularly for higher projectile charges
Q (see also below).

(i) Impact parallel to the minor axis
Figure 1 shows the eccentricity-dependent charge capture cross section σ/Q for
V = 1.66 and Q ranging from 1 to 8. Velocity matching is obtained at ε = +0.47;
at low Q, the cross section displays the well-known behavior with a pronounced
maximum at this eccentricity and a deep minimum for negative eccentricities
which characterize a strongly elongated Kepler ellipse with v antiparallel to vp.
For increasing Q, this structure is soon washed out; while it is still noticeable for
Q=2 and 4, almost any trace of the minimum has disappeared for Q=8. Inspec-
tion of electron trajectories during the approach of the projectile ion reveals the
reason: as expected, the long range Coulomb force distorts the original Kepler el-
lipse already at quite long distances. This distortion is quite regular, and reminds
of a Stark eﬀect. Indeed, a simple estimate conﬁrms this: for Q=8, an electric
ﬁeld strength of 5V/cm (i.e., of the order of the ﬁelds applied to the collision
region in the experiments [1]) is attained at approximately 105 a.u. This initial
state eﬀect might be reduced in the experiment by applying a strong ﬁeld in the
target region; however, this results also illuminates an inherent weakness of the
CTMC-approach: the slow rise of the electric ﬁeld may ”in reality” induce adi-
abatic transitions between the many Rydberg states which would be populated
diﬀerently in the classical calculation. This distortion of the initial state becomes
quite severe at distances below 104 a.u., i.e., corresponding to several revolution
of the Rydberg electron about its nucleus; therefore, it is to be believed that the

2

washing out of the cross section structure is indeed a real eﬀect. Finally, we may
add that also the impact parameter dependence of the capture probability reﬂects
the signature of this eﬀect. While for Q=1 and ε = +0.47 (the velocity matching
situation) the capture probability is rather concentrated about the perihelion po-
sition [6], it is nearly symmetric about b=0 (the position of the target nucleus)
for Q=8.

(ii) Impact parallel to the major axis
For this study, we choose ε = 0.96, corresponding to l = 7. This creates a quite
elongated state which is not too non-classical (low l). Figure 2 shows for Q=8 the
cross sections for upstream (σu) and downstream (σd) geometry, respectively, in-
cluding the contributions of the various ”swaps” to the capture cross sections. A
swap has been deﬁned as a passage of the electron through the midplane between
projectile and the target nucleus; note, however, that for asymmetric collisions
(q 6= Q as studied here), this plane has to cut the connection line between target
and projectile nucleus at the saddle point of the two respective Coulomb poten-
tials (i.e, at a distance R/(1 + qq/Q) from the projectile, with R the distance of
both nuclei). In view of the discussion in section (i) above, the strong upstream-
downstream asymmetry seen in these data is at ﬁrst glance somewhat surprising.
Again, inspection of the electron trajectories sheds light on this point: the slowly
increasing electric ﬁeld of the approaching projectile causes a distortion and pre-
cession of the Kepler ellipse, in general not strong enough, however, to revert the
upstream into a downstream geometry and vice versa. Therefore, upon approach
of the projectile into the actual close interaction the electron is still mainly fore
or aft, respectively, of the target nucleus, thus qualitatively preserving the role
of the initial spatial distribution of the electron; interestingly, even 3-swap and
higher swap processes can still be discerned. The qualitatively diﬀerent behavior
of σu and σd beyond V = 1.5 is associated with diﬀerently rising cross sections for
ionization; in case of the downstream geometry it sets in at considerably smaller
V-values as compared to the upstream geometry. This is further clariﬁed by the
respective impact parameter dependencies (Fig.3a,b): In the upstream situation,
charge exchange extends out to fairly large distances and ionization is still weak;
in the downstream situation, the maximum charge exchange probability is of the
same order as in the upstream case, however, it is limited to much smaller impact
parameters, and ionization is already quite strong.

To conclude, our analysis shows that for impact of multiply charged ions
of intermediate velocities the role of the initial electron momentum distribution
becomes weaker for increasing projectile charge. This is due to the strong per-
turbation of the initial state by the approaching ion which induces pronounced
changes in the momentum distribution long before the actual close interaction
occurs. In contrast, the initial spatial orientation of the electron continues to be
important for all Q-values studied here.

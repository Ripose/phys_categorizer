A variational wave function constructed with correlated Hyperspherical Harmonic functions
is used to describe the Helium trimer. This system is known to have a deep bound state.
In
addition, diﬀerent potential models predict the existence of a shallow excited state that has been
identiﬁed as an Eﬁmov state. Using the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle the energies and wave
functions of both bound states have been obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. The
introduction of a suitable correlation factor reduces considerably the dimension of the basis needed
to accurately describe the structure of the system. The most recent helium-helium interactions have
been investigated.

I. INTRODUCTION

The system He-He is greatly interesting both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view, and it has
been object of intense investigations in the last years. Despite its simplicity, it is not easy to determine whether it
supports or not a bound state. Experimentally, usual spectroscopy techniques are not suitable to its study, and only
recently [1–4] diﬀraction experiments proved its existence, with a direct measurement of its bond length < R >. Its

Theoretically diﬃculties in the description of the 4He2 arise because the He-He interaction results from the sub-
traction of the huge energies of the separated atoms, which are only slightly diﬀerent. Moreover, a 1% decrease of
the strength of the interaction makes the system unbound. As a result of the continuous reﬁnement in the past years
of both experimental data and electronic structure computational techniques, several potential curves for He-He ap-
peared in literature. Most of them are presented and compared in an article review by Janzen and Aziz [5]. However,
due to the vivid interest in 4He2 , and to the diﬃculties in making a really accurate ab initio potential, newer and
more accurate potentials have recently appeared in literature. Among the ones described in Ref. [5], the potentials
called HFDB [6], LM2M2 [7], TTY [8] have been widely used in helium cluster calculations. Furthermore, two more
up-to-date curves, namely SAPT1 and SAPT2 [9] are now available. The latter is believed to be the most accurate
characterization of the He-He interaction yet proposed. These potentials are constructed on a completely ab initio
calculations made by Korona et al. [10], using inﬁnite order perturbation theory (SAPT) and very large orbital basis
set. In addition, retarded dipole-dipole dispersion interaction is included over the range 0
100000 a.u.(SAPT1), or
the more appropriate 10-100000 a.u.(SAPT2).

All these ﬁve interactions support only a single bound state of zero total angular momentum.

In Table I we
summarize the diﬀerent characteristics of each potential, as well as salient properties of the associated bound state.
The latter has been computed solving the two-body Schr¨odinger equation by means of the Numerov algorithm . We
used the value ¯h2/m = 43.281307 K a.u.2. ¿From the table we can immediately see that the ﬁve potentials do not
diﬀer qualitatively among each other, though there is a spreading in the binding energy of the dimer
of 0.51
mK. The SAPT potentials predict the highest binding energies whereas the LM2M2 and TTY predictions are very
close to each other and are the lowest ones. The diﬀerences observed in the binding energy are reﬂected in the mean
values of the radius, < R > and < R2 >, as well as in the scattering length a0. The estimate bond length < R > can
and the
be directly compared to the experiment and can be also used for an estimation of the binding energy
scattering length a0 through the relations given in the ﬁrst paragraph. Those values are shown in the last two rows of
Table I and reasonably agree with the estimation of Ref. [4], in particular the results obtained with the LM2M2 and
TTY potential are inside the quoted errors. We can also observe that the system is strongly correlated as its binding
results from a large cancellation between the kinetic < T > and potential energy < V >. Its spatial
energy
extension is considerably bigger than the range of the potential, as it is shown in Fig.1 where the LM2M2 potential
and the dimer bound state wave function Φd are plotted. Finally, the scattering length a0 of the system is bigger

than the range of the potential by an order of magnitude. All these features characterize the 4He2 as the weakest, as
well as the biggest, diatomic molecule found in nature so far. Moreover the bound state at practically zero energy
suggests the possibility of observing an Eﬁmov-like state in the triatomic compound [11,12].

Along with the observations of small clusters of helium atoms, diﬀerent theoretical methods have been used to
study the properties of such systems. From the beginning it has been clear that standard techniques could have
problems to describe those highly correlated structures and, accordingly, more sophisticated methods have been
applied. In Ref. [13] the diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method was used to describe the ground state of He molecules
up to 10 atoms. The 4He3 has been extensively studied by diﬀerent methods (see Ref. [14] and references therein).
Theoretically it has been shown that the trimer has a deep ground state of about 126 mK and a single L = 0 excited
state of about 2 mK. There are not bound states with L > 0 [15]. In Refs. [16,17] the L = 0 excited state has been
studied, in particular looking at those characteristics identifying an Eﬁmov state. In fact this state has the property
of disappearing when the interaction strength is tuned with a parameter λ. For example, the excited state exists in
the very narrow interval 0.97 <
1.2 for the LM2M2 potential. Though with slightly diﬀerent values of λ, the same
∼
property holds for the other potentials mentioned above. Therefore the helium trimer gives the unique possibility of
observing the Eﬁmov eﬀect, as the narrow range in λ where the excited state 4He∗
3 appears contains the physical case
λ = 1.

λ <
∼

In the present paper a set of correlated basis functions is used to describe the 4He3 molecule. The correlated
hyperspherical harmonic (CHH) basis has been applied successfully in the ground state description of light nuclei [18].
Similarly to the cluster of helium, these systems are strongly correlated due to the high repulsion of the nucleon-
nucleon potential at short distances. Essentially the method consists in a decomposition of the wave function in
terms of the hyperspherical harmonic (HH) basis multiplied by a suitable correlation factor which takes into account
the fact that the probability of ﬁnding any pair of atoms at distances smaller than 3 a.u. is practically zero. The
correlation factor has been taken as product of one dimensional correlation functions f (r) (Jastrow type). In Fig.1
f (r) is compared to the dimer wave function, showing that both have the same short range behaviour.

The variational description of the trimer using the CHH basis is twofold. Firstly we would like to evaluate the
capability of the correlated basis functions to describe a strongly correlated system. Special attention will be given to
the convergence pattern of the energy for both the ground and excited states. In Ref. [14] calculated binding energies
of the ground and excited states of the trimer obtained by diﬀerent groups are given in correspondence with diﬀerent
interactions. The solutions of the Faddeev equations as well as variational methods and adiabatic approaches have
been used in those calculations. For the very shallow excited state of the trimer, only few results using the variational
method have been reported so far, showing the diﬃculty of describing this state with the required accuracy using
such a technique. In the present work we will show that it is possible to obtain high precision upper bound estimates
and wave functions for both the ground and excited states by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. Moreover,
a detailed study of the wave function will be performed. In particular the tail of the wave function will be analyzed
with the extraction of the asymptotic constants. The second motivation of the present work regards the extension of
the method to describe larger systems. In fact a complete study of the ground state and excited states of the tetramer
has still to be performed. In this context the variational technique is promising and the present study should be
considered a ﬁrst step along this direction.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section a discussion of the CHH basis for the systems of three atoms
is given. The numerical results for the binding energy of the two bound states are given in Sect. 3. Some properties
of the wave functions and the asymptotic constants are calculated in Sect. 4 whereas the main conclusions as well as
some perspectives for the extension to larger systems are given in the last section.

In the present study the interaction between three helium atoms is taken as a sum of three pairwise potentials. The

Hamiltonian of the system will be

where T is the kinetic energy operator and V (i, j) is the He-He interaction that in the present work will be taken as
one of the potentials mentioned in the previous section.

Considering the helium atom as a spinless boson, the wave function for three identical spinless bosons can be written

as a sum of three Faddeev–like amplitudes

harmonic (HH) function with deﬁned total angular momentum.

The other ingredient in the expansion of eq.(4) is the correlation factor, taken in the present work of the product
(Jastrow) type. Its role is to speed the convergence of the expansion describing those conﬁgurations in which two
particles are close to each other. The use of Jastrow correlation factors has a long tradition in the description of
inﬁnite systems as nuclear matter or liquid helium [20] as well as in the description of light nuclei
[18]. The wave
function describing strongly interacting structures, in which the interaction is highly repulsive at short distances, is
practically zero when the distance between any pair of particles is smaller than the repulsive core of the potential.
The correlation factor imposes this behaviour as it can be seen from the speciﬁc form of the correlation function f (r)
given in Fig.1. The short range behaviour of f (r) is governed by the two-body potential whereas its medium and long
range form is not critical since the structure of the system will be constructed by the HH basis. A simple procedure to
determine the correlation function for states in which the pair (i, j) is in a relative state with zero angular momentum
is to solve the following zero-energy Schr¨odinger-like equation [21]

The dimension N of the involved matrices is related to three indices: the number of angular channels Nα, the number
of hyperspherical polynomials per channel Kα and the number of Laguerre polynomials per channel Mα. According
to the Hylleraas-Undheim-MacDonald’s theorem [22,23], there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the ap-
proximate energy levels Ei(N ) and the exact levels ǫi

The implementation of the method in the speciﬁc case of the helium trimer in which two bound states are known
to exist, consists in solving the generalized eigenvalues problem for increasing values of N , until a convergence is
achieved in the estimates of the ground state E0 and excited state E1. Moreover, an optimum choice of the non-liner
parameter β can be used to improve the pattern of convergence.

III. BOUND STATE CALCULATIONS

The generalized eigenvalue problem of eq.(13) can be solved to ﬁnd bound states of general value of total angular
momentum LM . Here we are interested in the ground and excited state of the helium trimer both having total
angular momentum L = 0. In such a case the angular dependence of each i-amplitude of the wave function reduces to
a Legendre polynomial Pl(µi) with µi = ˆxi
ˆyi. Moreover, the angular channel with ℓα = Lα = 0 is, by far, the most
important and it has been the ﬁrst one to be considered. Contributions from successive channels, with ℓα = Lα > 0,
are highly suppressed due to centrifugal barrier considerations and can be safely disregarded as it will be discussed
latter.

·

The matrix elements deﬁned in eq.(13) have been obtained numerically. In general, as the dimension of the matrices
increases, numerical problems could arise from integrals containing polynomials of high degree. In fact, a high number
of basis functions is expected in order to describe simultaneously both the ground and excited state, which have a
completely diﬀerent spatial extent. On the other hand, the correlation functions introduce a complicated structure
at short distances. Therefore, a dense grid of integration points is necessary. The integrals have been performed in
the set of coordinates [ρ, φ3, µ3] using a Gauss formula in the variable µ3 and a Chebyshev Lobatto formula in the
variable cos(2φ3). Grids of 300 points for the ﬁrst case and 3000 for the second have been used. In the variable ρ the
integrals have been performed on a scaled grid:

The convergence of the eigenvalues has been studied increasing the number of basis elements, restricting the dis-
cussion to one channel, namely the ℓα = Lα = 0 channel. In this case a totally symmetric wave function can be
constructed for values of the quantum number k = 0, 2, ...., kmax (no symmetric function exists for k = 1). Therefore,
the number of hyperspherical polynomials K0 included in a speciﬁc calculation is kmax, except for kmax = 0 which
corresponds K0 = 1. The number of Laguerre polynomials is M0 = mmax + 1 with mmax the maximum degree
considered. The total dimension of the problem to be solved is N = K0 ·
In Table II the convergence of E0 and E1 is shown as a function of kmax, mmax for the LM2M2 potential. We
observe that, while the ground state energy E0 converges with a rather small basis set, for the excited state E1
it is needed a much bigger basis (about one order of magnitude bigger). The ground state converged to the value
2.27 mK with
E0 =
kmax = 80 and mmax = 32. In order to speed the convergence with respect to the Laguerre polynomials the value of
the non linear parameter β has been optimized. For the ground and excited state we have used β = 0.40 a.u.−1 and
β = 0.10 a.u.−1 respectively.

After the convergence of the ﬁrst channel is achieved, the contribution of the channel ℓα = Lα = 2 can be evaluated.
The ﬁrst four linearly independent totally symmetric basis elements belonging to the second channel correspond to
values of the grand angular quantum number K = 12, 16, 18, 20. The inclusion of these elements gives extremely small
contributions to the binding energy of the two states and does not change the estimates given above. It is important
2 already in a
to notice that the Jastrow correlation factor introduced contributions from channels with ℓα = Lα
calculation limited to the ﬁrst channel.

≥

Special attention has been given to the study of the convergence with the non-linear parameter β. In Fig.2 we
reported the ground and excited state energy curves as a function of β for increasing values of kmax. The number of
Laguerre polynomials has been kept ﬁxed at mmax = 24. For the ground state energy the upper curve corresponds
to kmax = 0, i.e. only one hyperspherical polynomial has been taken into account, and the lower curve corresponds
to kmax = 20. Results with larger values of kmax are not shown since they completely overlap with the result at
kmax = 20. For the excited state energy the diﬀerent curves correspond to kmax = 20, 40, 60, 80. We observed that
there is a region where the variation of β does not appreciably aﬀect the binding energies.

The variational method provides, in addition to an upper bound to the exact energy of the states, a variational
estimate of the corresponding wave functions. Through the wave function it is possible to calculate a certain number
of mean values characterizing the ground and excited state. In Tables III-IV, we computed the binding energy, the
mean value of the kinetic energy, the potential energy, the interparticle distance rij , and the distance ri between the
i-particle and the center of mass. The HFDB, LM2M2, TTY, SAPT1 and SAPT2 interactions have been considered.
Other than typical observables, we also computed the asymptotic normalization constants cν for the two bound states,
as deﬁned in Refs. [24,25] and brieﬂy described below, and the percentage P ν
d of dimer-like structures in the trimer
wave functions Ψν (ν = 0, 1).

The variational wave function is constructed in the present work as a sum of correlated products of polynomials with
an exponential tail in the hyperradius. The short range behaviour of the wave function is governed by the correlation
factor whereas in the medium and asymptotic region the expansion should reproduce the structure of the system. It
is interesting to evaluate the ﬂexibility of the correlated basis to reproduce correctly the asymptotic behaviour. Let
us introduce the asymptotic function Θν(y):

LM2M2 and TTY are slightly smaller. Conversely, for the excited state the result obtained with SAPT2 is smaller

The results for the ground and excited state are collected in Tables III and IV for the diﬀerent interactions. For
the trimer ground state the probability of a dimer-like structure is around 0.35, whereas for the excited state this
probability increases up to 0.75 for LM2L2 and TTY interactions. The two SAPT interactions predict a lower dimer-
like structure, in particular SAPT2. This behaviour is related to the slightly tighter binding predicted by the SAPT
potentials for the two bound states. As a general remark, the very high value of P 1
d (nearly 70%, compared to 35%
of the ground state) suggests that the excited state of 4He3 can eﬀectively be pictured as a third particle orbiting
around a two particle structure.

In Fig.4 we plotted some distribution functions relevant to understand the structure of the two bound states of the
trimer. Namely, we plotted the pair distribution function p(rij ), which represents the probability to ﬁnd the particles
i and j at distance rij , and the mass distribution function m(ri), which is related to the probability to ﬁnd the particle
i at distance ri from the center of mass of the system.

Our results for the ground state agree quite well with the ones published in literature [16,17,26,28,27]. For the SAPT
potentials we ﬁnd that the bond becomes slightly tighter (
5%), as a result of the its more attractive well. But
basically there are not qualitative diﬀerences in describing the trimer with any of the diﬀerent pairwise interactions.
There is a discrepancy in literature whether the main spatial arrangement of the three particles in the ground state is
either a quasilinear or equilateral conﬁguration [29]. Our results seem to agree with the latter. In fact, we can try to
discriminate between the two by looking at the pair distribution and the mass distribution functions. As it is shown
in Fig.4, the probability to ﬁnd any particle in proximity of the CM is almost zero. This strongly suggests that the
most probable conﬁguration is the equilateral one. Moreover, the ratio between < rij > / < ri > is very close to
the ideal √3 of equilateral triangle for all the potentials we used. Regarding the excited state, the presence of a two
peaks structure in the pair distribution function agrees with the interpretation of such a state as composed by a two
particle core surrounded by the third atom at a larger distance.

≈

For the excited state the results do not depend qualitatively on the potential we use. This may look very surprising
at a ﬁrst glance, because this state is suspected to be an Eﬁmov state, and consequently it is expected to be strongly
aﬀected by any minimum variation of the pairwise interaction. Following Refs. [16,17,27], we studied the behaviour
of 4He∗
Ed of
3 as a function of the strength of the pairwise interaction. In Fig.5 we plotted the energy diﬀerence E1 −
the system as a function of the parameter λ deﬁned by:

where VL is the LM2M2 potential. We found that this state disappears both increasing and decreasing λ, in agreement
with the claim that it is an Eﬁmov state. Our results agree quite well with Refs. [16,17], where the peculiarity of such
a behaviour has been widely discussed. To summarize it, we observed that the trimer begins to support an excited
state at λ
1.05,
and successively decreases, until it dissociates.

0.975; then, increasing λ, the binding energy ﬁrstly increases, until it achieves its maximum at λ

In order to compare the diﬀerent pairwise interactions we assume that due to the very large extension of the w.f.
compared to the range of the potential, the particles are not sensitive to the particular shape of it, but somehow to
its average strength. Accordingly we deﬁne

with x = L, T, H, S1, S2 in accordance with the LM2M2, TTY, HFDB, SAPT1 and SAPT2 interactions and σx is the
interparticle distance where the considered potential changes sign, i.e. Vx(σx) = 0. In the smaller frame of Fig.5 we
reported the diﬀerent values of λx. It is worth to observe that the potentials do not diﬀer so much to show dissimilar
results, as all the points lie in a small interval of λL = 1. In fact a plot in function of λ for the other interactions
shows that in all cases the physical case λ = 1 is on the left of the minimum of the curve, as for the LM2M2 potential.
The most peculiar feature of an Eﬁmov like system is that it disappears tightening the interaction among its
components. Physically, such a behaviour could be explained by picturing the system like composed by a third

particle orbiting around a two particle sub-system. Increasing the strength of the pairwise interaction makes the two
particles tighter to each other, and the third one evaporates as a result of its very weak bound.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In the present work the helium trimer has been investigated using the most recent helium-helium potential models.
The helium trimer wave function has been expanded in terms of the CHH basis. Then, the energies and wave
functions of the ground and excited state have been obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. The
Hylleraas-Undheim-MacDonald’s theorem assures that the obtained results for the energy of the levels represent
upper bounds to the exact values.

The strong repulsion of the He-He potential at short distances engenders some diﬃculties in the description of
the three atoms system in terms of an expansion basis. Very large bases are then necessary in order to obtain a
satisfactory description of the structure of both bound states. The structure is such that the probability of ﬁnding
two atoms at short distances is close to zero and this type of behaviour is diﬃcult to describe using, for example,
a polynomial expansion. Correlation factors naturally introduce this behaviour accelerating the rate of convergence
of the expansion basis. In particular the CHH basis combines a Jastrow correlation factor with the HH basis. The
CHH basis has been used before in the description of nuclear systems [18] in order to take into account the strong
repulsion of the nucleon-nucleon interaction at short distances. Here, the CHH basis has been used to study ﬁve
diﬀerent interactions in the description of the trimer. The pattern of convergence for the bound and excited state
has been studied by increasing the number of basis elements. With a suﬃcient number of elements, the dependence
on the non linear parameter β is smooth. Therefore it is possible to obtain a simultaneous description of the bound
states with high accuracy. The results are collected in Tables III-IV and are in close agreement with previous results
obtained by diﬀerent groups using the HFDB, LM2M2 and TTY interactions. The estimates for the binding energy
are upper bounds to the exact levels and show that the variational method can be used to describe strongly correlated
systems, as helium trimer, with results that are believed to be among the most accurate ones at present.

Some interesting aspects of the wave function have been studied. Its asymptotic behaviour in a conﬁguration where
one atom is moving away from the other two is given in eq.(18). In Fig.3 this behaviour is shown for the two bound
states. From this study the asymptotic constants cν have been extracted. In some particular systems the asymptotic
constants can be measured [30]. Moreover, the probability Pd of a dimer-like structure inside the trimer has been
calculated. This quantity gives a clear idea of the spatial structure of the molecule. For the ground state we obtained
P 0
0.35 whereas for the excited state P 1
0.70. This latter result suggests a conﬁguration of two atoms in a
dimer-like state with a third atom orbiting.

d ≈
The present work should be consider as a ﬁrst step in the use of the variational technique with correlated basis
functions for describing small helium clusters. The extension of the method to study larger systems is feasible. The
study of the bound states of the tetramer is at present underway and will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.

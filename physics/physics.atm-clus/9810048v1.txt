1. INTRODUCTION

In recent years, electronic spectroscopy of transition ions (transition-

metal ions and rare-earth ions) in crystalline environments has been the

object of important developments. In particular, the advent of tunable

dye lasers has made possible to perform two-photon spectroscopy experi-

ments. (In p-photon spectroscopy, p photons simultaneously occur in the

light-matter interaction. For example, p-photon absorption spectroscopy

corresponds to the simultaneous absorption of p photons between an ini-

tial and a ﬁnal level and has to be distinguished from the sequential ab-

sorption of p photons between the two levels.) Two-photon spectroscopy

(p = 2) with laser beams is now a technique complementary of one-photon

spectroscopy (p = 1). It gives many informations on the structural (and

dynamical) properties of ions in crystals. More speciﬁcally, two-photon

spectroscopy permits to reach excited levels which cannot be reached with

one-photon spectroscopy. In addition, by playing with the polarization

of the two involved photons, one may obtain interesting selection rules.

Similar interests exist in principle for p-photon spectroscopy with p > 2

although experiments are hardly feasible (except for ions in vapors) when

p ≥ 4.

Since the pioneer works by Kaiser and Garrett [1] and Axe [2] in the

sixties, there have been many progress, from an experimental and a theo-

retical viewpoint, in two-photon spectroscopy of dN and f N ions in crys-

2

tals. From the theoretical side, the progress have been achieved, for both

parity-allowed and parity-forbidden transitions, in two directions: (i) the

elaboration of more and more sophisticated models and (ii) the systematic

use of symmetry considerations [3 - 20] based on symmetry adaptation

techniques [21, 22]. In the present paper, we shall be concerned mainly

with point (ii). More speciﬁcally, we shall give a brief review on the use of

symmetry considerations, in conjunction with sophisticated models, for

the description of electric-dipole two-photon transitions. A more detailed

exposure may be found in [9, 10, 12, 13] for parity-forbidden transitions

and in [11 - 13] for parity-allowed transitions (see also Ref. [23]).

For the sake of generality, we shall give the relevant intensity formu-

las for p-photon (electric-dipole) transitions. The case p = 2 shall follow

as a particular case.

2. INTENSITY FORMULA

The electric-dipole moment is an odd operator. Therefore, for p

arbitrary, parity-allowed transitions correspond to either nℓN → nℓN

transitions for p even or nℓN → nℓN −1n′ℓ′ transitions with ℓ + ℓ′ odd for

p odd while parity-forbidden transitions correspond to either nℓN → nℓN

transitions for p odd or nℓN → nℓN −1n′ℓ′ transitions with ℓ + ℓ′ odd for

p even.

Let us consider a p-photon (absorption) transition between an initial

3

level i of symmetry Γ and a ﬁnal level f of symmetry Γ′. (Here, Γ and

Γ′ stand for two irreducible representations of the group G for N even or

of its spinor group G∗ for N odd. We note G the point symmetry group

of the ℓN ion in its environment. Furthermore, we use γ and γ′ to label

the Stark components of the levels of symmetry Γ and Γ′, respectively.)

The transition matrix element Mi(Γγ)→f (Γ′γ′) can be calculated in the

framework of the following approximations:

(i) we restrict ourselves to the electric-dipole (i.e., great wavelength)

approximation,

radiation ﬁeld,

(ii) single mode excitations (with given energy, wave number and

polarization vector for each of the p photons) are used for describing the

(iii) only p-th order mechanisms arising from time-dependent per-

turbation theory are considered,

(iv) a quasi-closure approximation (which amounts to ignore the in-

ternal structure of the intermediate conﬁgurations) is used,

(v) the only good quantum numbers are Γγ and Γ′γ′ (and the par-

ity for parity-allowed transitions) for the initial and ﬁnal state-vectors,

respectively,

(vi) if necessary, as for parity-forbidden transitions, q-th order mech-

anisms (q ≥ 1) arising from time-independent perturbation theory are

4

considered,

(1)

(2)

(vii) we use a weak-ﬁeld basis adapted to the chain SU (2) ⊃ G∗ for

describing the state-vectors and interactions.

From recoupling techniques, it can be shown that (under the above-

mentioned hypotheses) the transition matrix element Mi(Γγ)→f (Γ′γ′) is

given by

Mi(Γγ)→f (Γ′γ′) = (f Γ′γ′|Heﬀ |iΓγ),

where Heﬀ is a model-dependent eﬀective operator. The most general

form of Heﬀ turns out to be

Heﬀ =

k

C[k1k2 · · · kp−1; t; kSkL; k]

(cid:16){P(kp−1)X(t)}(k). W(kS kL)k

(cid:17) ,

where ( . ) is a scalar product involving electronic (W(kS kL)k) and nonelec-

tronic (P(kp−1) and X(t)) tensors. In Eq. (2), P(kp−1) is the polarization

tensor

P(kp−1) = {· · · {{E1E2}(k1)E3}(k2) · · · Ep}(kp−1)

(3)

that describes the coupling of the unit polarization vectors Ei (i =

1, 2, · · · , p). In addition, W(kS kL)k and X(t) are tensors relative to the

ion and its environment: W(kS kL)k is an electronic tensor (of spin degree

kS, orbital degree kL and total degree k) whereas X(t) is the ligand po-

larization tensor or the crystal-ﬁeld tensor (of the degree t). Finally, the

expansion coeﬃcients C in (2) are calculable in an ab initio way.

5

The matrix element (1) can be easily calculated by using Wigner-

Racah calculus (i.e., irreducible tensor methods) for a chain of groups

SU (2) ⊃ G∗ as developed in Refs. [21, 22]. The quantity of importance

for a comparison between theory and experiment is the intensity strength

X
γγ′ (cid:12)
(cid:12)
for the i(Γ) → f (Γ′) transition. The sum over γ and γ′ in Eq. (4) can

be eﬀectuated by means of the Racah lemma for the Clebsch-Gordan

coeﬃcients of the group SU (2) in a SU (2) ⊃ G∗ basis. As a ﬁnal result,

we obtain the intensity formula [10 - 13]

Si(Γ)→f (Γ′) =

with 1 ≤ j ≤ p−1. The polarization dependence in (5) is contained in the

two P factors. This dependence, which may involve linear and/or circu-

lar polarization types, is entirely under the control of the experimentalist.

The intensity parameters I in (5) are given by expressions that depend

on: (i) the nature (energy) of the p absorbed photons, (ii) the involved

conﬁgurations via energy factors, wavefunctions and radial integrals, (iii)

recoupling coeﬃcients for the group SU (2) and reduced matrix elements,

(iv) the group G via coupling coeﬃcients and isoscalar factors for the

chain SU (2) ⊃ G∗, and (v) the order q of the (time-independent) mecha-

nism used for treating some of the interactions (especially the spin-orbit

interaction and the crystal-ﬁeld interaction).

6

It is remarkable that the structural form of (5) holds for both parity-

allowed and parity-forbidden transitions. This forms (actually based on

group theory) also holds when some of the absorbed photons are replaced

by scattered photons (Raman or Rayleigh scattering). The general form

of (5) is also valid for other multi-photon processes, as for example the

simultaneous absorption of several photons, certain by electric-dipole ab-

sorption and others by magnetic-dipole and/or electric-quadrupole ab-

sorption. Note also that vibronic degrees of freedom may be incorporated

in (5) (see Ref. [14]).

3. CLOSING REMARKS

The intensity parameters I may be calculated from ﬁrst principles.

This leads to a very much involved quantum chemistry problem. Alter-

natively, they may be considered, at least in a ﬁrst approach, as phe-

nomenological parameters to be adjusted on experimental data. It may

be also interesting to combine the ab initio and phenomenological ap-

proaches. In all approaches the number of I parameters is limited by a

set of properties and selection rules [10 - 13].

Once the number of independent parameters I in the intensity for-

mula (5) has been determined, we can obtain the polarization dependence

of the intensity strength Si(Γ)→f (Γ′) by calculating the tensor products
P (K)
a′′Γ′′γ′′ (with K = kp−1, ℓp−1 and a′′ = r, s) occurring in Eq. (5). For

7

this purpose, we use the development

characterizing the circular or

linear polarization of the i-th photon (i = 1, 2). In general, we may have

k1 = 0, 1, 2. However, if the two involved photons are identical (one-color

beam), k1 assumes only the values 0 and 2. Equation (7) describes the

polarization tensor for p = 2. If p > 2, repeated couplings of the type of

the one entering Eq. (7) yield an expression for the polarization tensor.

In the case where p = 2, the symmetry adaptation techniques and

models sketched through Eqs. (1 - 7) have been successfully applied to f N

ions [15 - 18] and dN ions [19, 20] in crystals. As a brief r´esum´e, we note

the following tendencies. For intraconﬁgurational transitions within the

conﬁgurations 3dN (N 6= 5) and 4f N (N 6= 7), second-order mechanisms

(p = 2, q = 0) are generally suﬃcient for “nonhypersensitive” two-photon

transitions. For “hypersensitive” two-photon transitions (like 5D0 → 7F0

8

transitions within the 4f 6 conﬁguration in tetragonal symmetry), third-

order mechanisms (p = 2, q = 1) are required for a satisfactory descrip-

tion of the polarization dependence. For interconﬁgurational two-photon

transitions (like 4f 6 → 4f 55d transitions in tetragonal symmetry), it is

also necessary to consider at least third-order mechanisms (p = 2, q = 1)

for a good agreement between theory and experiment.

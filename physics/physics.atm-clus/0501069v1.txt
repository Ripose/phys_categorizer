We present a microscopic model for Na clusters embedded in raregas matrices. The valence electrons of
the Na cluster are described by time-dependent density-functional theory at the level of the local-density
approximation (LDA). Particular attention is paid to the semi-classical picture in terms of Vlasov-LDA. The
Na ions and Ar atoms are handled as classical particles whereby the Ar atoms carry two degrees of freedom,
position and dipole polarization. The interaction between Na ions and electrons is mediated through local
pseudo-potentials. The coupling to the Ar atoms is described by (long-range) polarization potentials and
(short-range) repulsive cores. The ingredients are taken from elsewhere developed standards. A ﬁnal ﬁne-
tuning is performed using the NaAr molecule as benchmark. The model is then applied to embedded
systems Na8ArN . By close comparison with quantum-mechanical results, we explore the capability of the
Vlasov-LDA to describe such embedded clusters. We show that one can obtain a reasonable description by
appropriate adjustments in the ﬁne-tuning phase of the model.

1 Introduction

Structure and dynamics of metal clusters has been a much studied topic over the last two decades, see e.g.
[1, 2, 3]. While optical response was in the focus of numerous earlier studies, recent developments aim at
exploring cluster dynamics in all its aspects [4]. The preferred theoretical tool for describing clusters in all
dynamical regimes is the time-dependent local-density approximation (TDLDA) which treats the cluster
electrons at a fully quantum mechanical level, however in an independent-particle picture as motion in a
common self-consistent mean-ﬁeld. For highly excited systems, one can employ a semi-classical approx-
imation in terms of phase-space dynamics described by the Vlasov equation, in the cluster context called
a Vlasov-LDA. The Vlasov equation was originally used in a genuinely classical environment for plasma
physics [5]. Nuclear physicists have adapted it to ﬁnite quantum systems for the description of violent
heavy-ion collisions [6]. The motivation is twofold: ﬁrst, the Vlasov description becomes more efﬁcient
for highly excited system, and second, the semi-classical approach makes it feasible to include correla-
tions simply in terms of an ¨Uhling-Uhlenbeck collision term (extended Vlasov to VUU). The successful
applications in nuclear dynamics have motivated the transfer of the method to cluster physics, in the ﬁrst
round using a jellium model for the ionic background [7, 8, 9] but later also in connection with detailed
ions [10, 11]. These applications of Vlasov-LDA and VUU dealt up to now only with free metal clusters.
Many experiments, however, are done on supported or embedded clusters, see for example the study of
the systematics of optical properties in small Ag clusters [12]. There is thus a need to develop reliable and
efﬁcient models for the cluster-substrate interface in connection with cluster dynamics in various regimes.
Such developments are underway for TDLDA in embedded clusters whereby raregas matrices are consid-
ered as a substrate with simple constituents [13, 14, 15]. They take up the modeling of the Ar atoms and
their interaction with the Na cluster from earlier quantum-chemical considerations [16]. It is the aim of
the present paper to investigate the performance of Vlasov-LDA and VUU for metal clusters embedded in
raregas matrices. To that end, we recycle the interface model from the TDLDA studies and combine it with
the Vlasov-LDA description for the cluster electrons. We intend to develop a parameterization of the model
which provides acceptable ground state structures. These are then used as laboratory for dynamical studies.

a serves
to characterize the Ar dipole moment through d = eqArs = eqAr(R′ − R) where qAr is the net charge of the valence
cloud.

In the ﬁrst exploration here, we use a simple excitation mechanism (instantaneous boost) to evaluate the
basic features of dynamical response in various regimes, namely spectral distributions and ionization. The
validity and limitations of Vlasov-LDA are scrutinized by comparison with results from quantum mechan-
ical TDLDA. We also exploit the option of VUU for a ﬁrst exploration of dynamical correlations and their
interlay with the substrate.

The paper is outlined as follows: In section 2, we present the model in detail thereby providing all in-
formation for full TDLDA as well as for the semi-classical approaches. In section 3, we summarize brieﬂy
the emerging equations of motion and their numerical solution. In section 4, we discuss the calibration of
the model using the NaAr molecule as benchmark. Finally in section 5, we present and discuss ﬁrst results
for an embedded cluster with Na8ArN as test cases.

The key constituents are the valence electrons of the metal cluster. Starting point for their description is
quantum mechanical mean-ﬁeld theory where each electron is associated with one single-particle wave-

. The ϕn are determined by a (time-dependent) Kohn-Sham equation.
function
The manifold of occupied wavefunctions is comprised in the one-electron density matrix ρ(r, r′) =
n (r′). We perform a semi-classical approximation in order to obtain a description in terms
of the one-electron phase-space distribution f (r, p) [17]. This yields the Vlasov-LDA which has shown
P
to provide a reliable description of dynamical processes in free metal clusters with detailed ionic structure
[18, 19]. The other ingredients are the Na ions in the cluster and the raregas atoms. They are treated by
classical molecular dynamics in terms of positions R and associated momenta P. The Ar atom carries
as internal degree of freedom a dipole moment to account for the polarization interaction. Effective Ar
potentials for static calculations contain that implicitly. True dynamics requires explicit dipoles as we use
it here. It is convenient to formulate the Ar dipoles da in terms of the displacement R′
Ra = da/eqAr.
All these degrees of freedom are summarized in table 1.

The detailed description of the Ar atoms is outlined in the next subsection 2.2. What the Na+ ions is
concerned, we neglect the small dipole polarizability of the Na+ core and treat it merely as a monopole.
The ions are taken as point charges in the interaction with the Ar atoms. Soft and local pseudo-potentials
are used for the interaction with the cluster electrons [20], see eq. (5). The density of the electrons is given
naturally as deﬁned in mean-ﬁeld theories. It reads in the quantum mechanical version

2.2 Construction of soft dipole potentials

A ﬁnite dipole momentum in Ar atom is generated from Coulomb ﬁelds of the other constituents or from
the excitation mechanism. In turn, it produces a dipole ﬁeld to the outside world. However, a pure dipole
ﬁeld has a huge singularity at the origin. This is unphysical because we are not having point dipoles in
practice. With a closer look at the Ar atom we see that the dipole is generated from a deformation (more
precisely, displacement) of the outer electron shell (3s-3p-shell) and the ﬁnite size of the source delivers
regular Coulomb ﬁelds everywhere. We thus specify the dipole momentum of the Ar atom in more detail.
The Ar atom is thought of consisting out of a valence electron cloud with center of mass R′
a and of the
corresponding positively charged core placed at the atom position Ra. (In fact, one should use the center-
of-mass of core plus valence cloud but the recoil effect on the Ar core is negligible, thus neglected). Both,
valence cloud and core have the same absolute value of charge qAr delivering together a neutral atom. A
small displacement of the valence electrons against the core produces a net dipole moment. The proﬁle
of valence cloud and core is described by the same Gaussian with width σAr, yielding together the charge
distribution of one Ar atom as

in the Vlasov case. The Van-der-Waals energy EVdW is a correlation from the dipole excitation in the
Ar atom coupled with a dipole excitation in the cluster. It requires, in principle, an energy denominator
involving the basic excitation energy ∆EAr in the Ar atom and the typical excitation energy in the Na
∆EAr and eliminate the energy denominator in
cluster which is
the spirit of a closure approximation. This amounts to compute the variance of the dipole operator in the
cluster. It employs, in fact, an effective dipole operator fa, see eq. (3h), which corresponds to the dipole
ﬁeld from the smoothened Ar charge distributions. The dipole variance as expectation value within the
many-body wavefunctions is, furthermore, simpliﬁed in terms of the local variance. This yields ﬁnally the
approximation (3g) to the Van-der-Waals energy. Its computation is still very cumbersome. It becomes
particularly involved in the semi-classical case. On the other hand, Vlasov-LDA is intended for the regime
of high excitations where subtle details, as e.g. the Van-der-Waals force do not matter. Thus we skip EVdW
in Vlasov-LDA.

It is obvious that the polarization potentials are handled in terms of effective smoothened pseudo-
densities (2a) and their resulting Coulomb potential (2b). The repulsive core potentials require explicit

Table 2 Parameters for the ion-Ar pseudo-potential in Na according to the form (4c).

For the Ar-Ar core interaction we employ a Lennard-Jones type potential with parameters such that
binding properties of bulk Ar are reproduced. The Na-Ar core potential has been ﬁtted according to [21].
Note that the Na-Ar potential from [21] does contain also a long range part
αAr which accounts for the
dipole polarization-potential. We describe that long range part explicitely and have to omit it here. We thus
choose the form (4c). The pseudo-potential WelAr for the electron-Ar core repulsion has been modeled
according to the proposal of [16]. Its parameters will be re-tuned as discussed below.

2.4 The ion-electron pseudo-potential

with the error function given in eq. (2c). The parameters were adjusted to the properties of Na atom and
bulk. This serves to provide simultaneously correct bond lengths for Na molecule and clusters as well as
as good description of optical response, all in the framework of quantum-mechanical (TD)LDA [20]. A
semi-classical description of Na clusters does also work very well with a pseudo-potential in the form (5).
But it requires a new adjustment of the parameters suited for the Vlasov approach [22]. Both version for
the parameters are summarized in table 3.

2.5 The parameters for the polarization potential

The polarizability of the Ar atoms is described by the model of a rigid cloud of valence electrons which is
oscillating against the remaining raregas ion. The parameters of the model are:

2.6 Fine tuning of electron-Ar core potential

The parameters of the electron-Ar core potential (4a) determine sensitively the binding properties of Na to
the Ar atoms. We use that potential as a means for a ﬁnal ﬁne-tuning of the model. The benchmark for
adjustment is provided by the Na-Ar dimer. The data are taken from [23] and [24] and summarized in table
4. There are three data points and three parameters to be adjusted, namely Ael, βel, and rel. It turns out
that these three parameters compensate each other to some extent. One can, e.g. vary the potential height
Ael and obtain about the same ﬁt with re-tuning the other two parameters. Fortunately, we ﬁnd a reasonable
ﬁt to the wanted data in spite of that restricted ﬂexibility. Moreover, we exploit the freedom in the choice
of Ael to produce the softest reasonable core potential. It is obvious that such a subtle adjustment depends
crucially on the level of approach. We thus obtain two different sets for quantum calculation and for Vlasov
LDA, similar as it was the case already for the Na ion-electron pseudo-potential. The ﬁnal parameters are
summarized in table 5.

3 Dynamical equations and their solution

3.1 The equations of motion

The energy functional once speciﬁed (see section 2) determines structure and dynamics of the coupled
system. This follows standard techniques throughout. We thus give here only a very brief summary. More
details can be found in [4, 4] and speciﬁcally for the semi-classical approach in [9, 18].

equation for the phase-space distribution f (r, p, t), i.e.

where

the LDA energy functional is employed. That is why the scheme is called Vlasov-LDA. In fact, the above
equations of motion describe electronic dynamics, in terms of TDLDA or Vlasov-LDA, coupled to classical
MD for ions and atoms. The whole scheme is then TDLDA-MD in the quantum case or Vlasov-LDA-MD
in the semi-classical approximation.

It is the great advantage of the semi-classical approximation that it allows to include dynamical elec-
tronic correlations through an ¨Uhling-Uhlenbeck collision term. This extends Vlasov-LDA to the Vlasov-
¨Uhling-Uhlenbeck scheme (VUU). The eq. (7d) is then extended to

method [26]. The classical MD (7c) for ions and atoms is propagated by the (velocity) Verlet algorithm
[27]. The handling of the Vlasov equation (7d) and associated collision term (7f-7i) is more involved. It
will be detailed in the next subsection 3.2.

The static solution has to be provided before any dynamics can take off. The ionic/atomic conﬁguration
is found by a mix of simulated annealing and direct gradient towards the energy minimum. Standard
methods for the stationary Kohn-Sham equation apply in case of the quantum mechanical treatment. Most
involved is again the semi-classical case. A stable ground state distribution f0(r, p) for the Vlasov equation
is determined by the Thomas-Fermi method [9, 18]. It is to be noted that the density and mean ﬁeld entering
Thomas-Fermi has to be properly augmented with the test-particle folding (see next section) in order to
produce consistent input for the Vlasov solution with the test-particle method.

3.2 Test particle method

The phase-space distribution is a function in six-dimensional phase space. Its representation on a (six-
dimensional) grid is even today beyond the capacity of computers. One thus uses a representation in terms
of test-particles. This technique had been imported for cluster physics from the well developed nuclear
physics case [6]. The smooth one-body phase-space distribution f is represented by a swarm of pseudo-
particles each one having a certain width, i.e.

The folding widths σr and σp are free parameters of the method. Relation (8c) is connected to the
Husimi picture [28] which gives the elementary distribution grgp the interpretation of a minimal quantum-
mechanical wavepacket being used as means to derive and justify the semi-classical limit in the smoothest
way [17, 29, 30]. There remains σr as free parameter. It can be used to accommodate quantum-mechanical
binding properties through the Vlasov approximation as good as possible and it has been used successfully
that way for free clusters in jellium approach [7, 8, 9] as well as with detailed ionic background [10, 11, 18].
We use the value (8d) which provides a good reproduction of free neutral Na clusters.

Inserting the ansatz (8) into the Vlasov equation (7d) yields the following equation of motion for the

The Kohn-Sham potential is obtained from the ionic/atomic positions and the actual electron density com-
puted with eq. (1b) which reads in the test-particle representation

interpolation functions. The Coulomb and exchange-correlation potentials are determined on the grid
composing the Kohn-Sham potential together with the potentials from ions and atoms. The forces on the
test-particle are retrieved from the grid again with the help of the folding functions gr. This is the practical
side of eq. (9c).

The ﬁnite representation in terms of test-particles induces a principle long-time instability towards a
ﬁnal Boltzmann equilibrium distribution. This is unphysical because it violates the Pauli principle [31, 32].
The critical time depends on folding width and number of test particles. The folding width is ﬁxed by the
adjustment to quantum features. It remains the particle number. We chose Ntp = 4000 per electron.
This provides sufﬁcient stability over the time scale considered (200 fs). The collision term (7f) in VUU
contains the Pauli blocking. This provides long time stability of the propagation.

The practical evaluation of the collision term is already simpliﬁed by the test particle. The nine-fold
momentum-space integration is replaced by four-fold summation over test-particles, each factor fi con-
tributing one sum. The scattering process connects two incoming momenta with two outgoing ones,
(p1, p2)
(p3, p4). The outgoing momenta are ﬁxed by momentum and energy conservation laws
up to a scattering angle. The scattering angle is chosen from the unit sphere at random.

3.3 Excitation mechanism and observables

Typical cluster excitations are promoted by laser pulses or collision with highly charged ions. Both can
be described as external time-dependent Coulomb ﬁelds acting on the cluster. The coupling to the ﬁeld
Vext(r, t) is provided for that purpose in the basic energy functional (3). A laser pulse, e.g., is characterized

These are explored in the limiting case of an arbitrarily short laser pulse. It is realized by an instantaneous
initial boost of the whole electron cloud which reads, in the Vlasov case,

f (r, p, t = 0) = f0(r, p + b)

where f0 is the ground state distribution and b is the boost momentum. In the quantum case the boost is
applied to each electron orbital as

Most of the parameters entering our model are taken from other grounds, i.e. from values published else-
where and adjusted to independent data. The various constituents contribute strongly counteracting forces.
This calls for some freedom to ﬁnal ﬁne-tuning. We exploit the anyway not so easily determined electron-
Ar core potential for that purpose. The form (4a) is taken from quantum-chemical investigations [16].
The parameters are given free for ﬁne-tuning. Thereby we consider the Na-Ar dimer as benchmark. The
fully quantum mechanical TDLDA includes the Van-der-Waals interaction (3g) while the semi-classical

justment of the free parameters of the electron-Ar potential.
Figure 1 shows the Born-Oppenheimer
surfaces for the Na-Ar molecule. The TDLDA ﬁt complies nicely with the data point. The semi-classical
results manage to reach that approximately. The results from two different core heights serve to demon-
strate the variances one can explore in the adjustment: while reducing the core height, one can shift the
minimum closer to the wanted value, but at the same time one ﬁnds the bonding energy moving off the
optimum. Whatever one does, one ﬁnds that the semi-classical Born-Oppenheimer surfaces fall off much
more quickly than the TDLDA one. Note that the asymptotic in case of TDLDA is dominated by the Van-
r−6. Vlasov-LDA does not have that term and thus is bound to display a different

asymptotics. Altogether, one sees that it is by no means trivial that a good adjustment can be found at
all. Thus the TDLDA ﬁt is a remarkable agreement and we are also satisﬁed with the semi-classical results
which manage to ﬁnd a fair agreement for the binding point. One has to keep in mind that the stronghold of
Vlasov-LDA and VUU are the energetic processes. For these it sufﬁces to provide a stable starting ground-
state conﬁguration which reproduces roughly realistic binding properties. This is achieved by the choice of
parameters as listed in table 5. Thereby we have preferred the larger core height which provides the correct
bond length while giving a slightly too small binding energy. Note that the semi-classical adjustment was
done without explicit Van-der-Waals energy. This term is derived from quantum mechanical perturbation
theory. Its implementation in a semi-classical environment requires deeper theoretical development and
what we have found would increase the computational cost by an order of magnitude. That is not very
useful for an approach which concentrates on processes far above the low energy scale of binding.

A further benchmark point for TDLDA is the energy for the X 2Σ+

B2Σ+ transition at the bonding
conﬁguration. The goal is a transition energy of 0.155 Ry (see table 5); the TDLDA result with the
optimized parameters is 0.164 Ry, a satisfying agreement. This benchmark cannot be applied for the semi-
classical approach because there are no quantized single-particle states and thus no speciﬁc transitional
energy spectra. We will apply Vlasov-LDA to metal clusters. These have the Mie surface plasmon as
prominent excitation mode and this mode is determined by collective ﬂow rather than by single-particle
excitations. Thus we can expect a good reproduction of the Mie plasmon in spite of the missing single-
particle adjustment. This is indeed the case as many previous applications for free metal clusters have
exempliﬁed [7, 8, 9, 10, 18, 11]. We have yet to see how the model performs for embedded clusters.

5 The Na8ArN system

5.1 Structure

The ground state conﬁgurations involve 8–220 ions and atoms. This is hard to visualize in all detail. The
basic structure, however, is simple [13, 14]. There exist three close isomers for the Na8 clusters [14]. We
consider here the Na8 cluster in the shape consisting out of two rings with each four electrons. The Ar
matrix was originally arranged in radial shells. It is slightly perturbed by the embedded cluster. But the
shells still remain a useful guide and sorting scheme. Thus we will characterize the Na8 cluster by its
global root-mean-square radius and the Ar matrix is visualized as distribution of atoms in radial shells.

Figure 2 shows the radii for the (embedded) Na8. The ionic radii are generally smaller than the electronic
ones because the electronic cloud reaches farther out than the well localized ions. The difference between
electronic and ionic radius is caused mainly by the Gaussian folding with width σr.
It is thus nearly
constant. It is of the same order (although somewhat smaller) as the difference for the quantum mechanical
case. The latter shows an interesting detail: it is practically constant for cases with Ar matrix but jumps
by 0.2 a0 for the free cluster. This is due to the onset of core repulsion, similar as the ﬁrst step for Vlasov
LDA. In the further evolution, the radii show a different trend. While they slowly grow with NAr in the
quantum mechanical case, they shrink for Vlasov-LDA. This hints at a different mix of interactions with
the Ar atoms. The Ar core repulsion is felt more strongly for the test-particle in Vlasov-LDA because
these are associated rigidly with a Gaussian distribution. The repulsive core wants to push away the tail
and thus pushes the whole Gaussian. This works much different for the quantum mechanical case. The
electron cloud can react more “elastically”. It allows for a dip near the Ar core and evolves else-wise almost
unperturbed around it. Thus the dipole attraction can act more freely to pull the electronic tail outward.

Figure 3 shows the Ar part of the combined systems in terms of the radial atom distribution. The
differences between quantum LDA and Vlasov-LDA structures are dramatic for the small Ar matrices.
They converge to each other with increasing system size, similarly to the convergence observed in the
case of Na properties (Figure 2). The difference is again due to the rigidity of the ﬁxed Gaussian electron
distribution for Vlasov-LDA. This exaggerates core repulsion and diminishes dipole attraction. Moreover,
we are missing the long range Van-der-Waals attraction (see ﬁgure 1). The pressure from the outside
shells and the increasing dipole attraction from the far shells produce then the compression towards the
quantum mechanical (and thus more realistic) structures. The example demonstrates the limitations of the
test-particle method. The smooth Gaussian folding implied in the test-particle representation was perfectly
suited for the soft ionic pseudo-potentials of a free metal cluster (and the more so for the jellium approach
to a free cluster). But the inherent rigidity of the electronic test-particle distribution becomes a hindrance in
connection with steep potentials as they appear here in terms of the repulsive Ar cores. The Vlasov-LDA is
certainly not appropriate for detailed studies of subtle binding effects. We ﬁnd, however, that the structures
for larger matrices come out sufﬁciently well to provide a laboratory for dynamical studies in the non-linear

the effect of dynamical electron correlations on the resonance excitations.

5.2 Dynamics

In order to explore the basic dynamical properties, we employ the most simple excitation mechanism of
an instantaneous boost, as explained in section 3.3. It has only one parameter, the boost strength, which
allows to scan the various dynamical regimes. We pick a typical strength for each regime as listed in
table 6 and characterized by the initial excitation energy. To put that in perspective, one may compare it
with the typical energies in the system: at the side of the Na cluster we have the ionization potential with
2.9 eV. At the side

of the Ar atoms, we have their ﬁrst electronic excitation and the IP above 20 eV. The linear regime is far
below anyone of these scales, the semi-linear just of the same order, and the non-linear regime safely above
(multi-plasmon, strong emission).

The spectral properties from Vlasov-LDA (and VUU) are shown in ﬁgure 4 in terms of the power spec-
trum of the dipole mode along z-axis (which corresponds to the approximate symmetry axis of the Na8
cluster). The general pattern are much similar to previous studies on Na+
9 [34, 18]. There is a clear reso-
nance peak under any conditions. It is not destroyed by high excitations. These well developed resonance
features persist very well also for the embedded cluster. One may even ﬁnd the pattern somewhat cleaner
than for the free cluster. At second glance, one sees trends and developments. There is, e.g., the much
larger width in case of VUU which is obviously generated by the electron-electron collisions. We will now
work out the trends in terms of the key features of these simple spectra: the peak position ω(Mie) and the
width as full width at half maximum (FWHM).

Figure 5 shows these basic features in case of the system Na8Arn (n < 212) for quantum mechanical
calculations, Vlasov-LDA, and VUU. The peak frequencies (two lower panels) depend only very weakly
on the Ar matrix in all cases. The remaining small trend shows a red shift with increasing matrix size in
the quantum mechanical results. That is due to the fact that the additional Ar shells enhance the attractive
dipole interaction. The Vlasov results indicate the opposite trend. That is due to the decreasing radius of
the inner Ar shell (see ﬁgure 3) which gives more weight to the increasing core repulsion. The changes with
increasing excitation energy differ. The quantum mechanical results show a sizeable and systematically
increasing blue-shift. It can be explained by the increasing ionization which, in turn, deepens the binding
potential and thus increases the restoring force for the dipole oscillations [33]. The same trend is hinted
in the Vlasov results for the free Na8 shown in the upper panel of ﬁgure 4. But the Vlasov results for
the embedded cluster (middle panel of ﬁgure 5) behave differently in that the step from the linear to the
semi-linear regime shows a tiny (or no) red shift instead of a blue shift. The reasons for that are not yet
fully clear. The step into the non-linear regime then produces the blue-shift. Finally, the step to VUU has
negligible effect on the peak position as one would have expected.

The uppermost panel of ﬁgure 5 shows the widths of the resonance peaks in the Vlasov cases. The
spectral analysis uses a recording time of 100 fs and employs a ﬁltering to avoid artefacts from insufﬁciently

relaxed signals [35]. This sets the energy resolution of the analysis to 0.1 eV. The width of the Vlasov
results is hidden in the resolution except for the non-linear case which shows already some enhancement
due to a dynamical spreading (through ongoing ionization) of the spectra. However, the collision term
in VUU adds a substantial bit of 0.2 eV for free Na8 and 0.1 eV for the embedded clusters. It is a bit
surprising to see a reduction of the width when the matrix is around. This hints at a somewhat more
harmonic potential for the embedded cluster. The effect deserves a deeper analysis which, however, goes
beyond scope and limits of this paper.

Figure 6 shows the time evolution of ionization (number of emitted electrons) in case of the non-linear
excitation. The pattern for quantum-mechanical TDLDA and Vlasov-LDA are similar: there is a steep ini-
tial increase from direct electron emission and then a quick bending over to an almost ﬂat trend. The results
agree even quantitatively for the free cluster. For the embedded system, on the other hand, the agreement
may be just acceptable but is certainly less perfect with Vlasov-LDA showing about half of emission from
TDLDA. The reason is that cores of the surrounding Ar atoms build up a narrow potential barrier of about
1 eV height. This barrier reﬂects in Vlasov-LDA all test particles which do not have sufﬁcient kinetic
energy while quantum mechanical electrons in TDLDA can easily tunnel through. More violent excita-
tions produce a larger fraction of faster electrons and will thus diminish that difference. This conﬁrms
once again the rule that semi-classical approaches become increasingly valid with increasing excitation
energy. The VUU results in ﬁgure 6 show a qualitatively different trend. There remains a slope which
hints at signiﬁcant delayed emission of thermalized electrons. The free Na8 shows the well understood
deal: the VUU curve remains below Vlasov-LDA at early times because direct emission is suppressed in
favor of internal thermalization while it crosses the Vlasov line at later times when thermal emission takes
over [9]. In case of the embedded cluster, one ﬁnds the VUU emission enhanced in all time domains. We
see here again a classical effect. The part of thermal emission in VUU is isotropically distributed. The
electrons have thus more chances to escape through the saddles between the cores. Moreover, the more

effective thermalization in VUU allows to ﬁll more systematically the Boltzmann tail of the kinetic energy
distribution until some electrons have gathered sufﬁcient energy to surmount the extra barrier.

Figure 7 shows a summary of asymptotic values for ionization for different regimes, methods and system
sizes. There is little dependence on the size of the Ar matrix, except for the too small NAr = 30. Thus we
recognize many features from the previous ﬁgure. We see again the strong suppression of (direct) emission
in Vlasov-LDA. It is even more dramatic in semi linear regime (factor 8 suppression!) because it has a
larger fraction of slow electrons which cannot surmount the ﬁrst Ar barrier. We also ﬁnd again a systematic
trend of enhanced emission in VUU due to its larger contribution from isotropic emission and from the
Boltzmann tail. Altogether, the results for electron emission hint that the propagation of slow electrons
in the Ar matrix is much different between quantum TDLDA and semi-classical approaches. The latter
still provide useful guidelines and presently the only chance to study effects of electron-electron collisions.

One should, however, take care to remain in the regime of strong excitations where slow electrons are less
important.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a model for the description of the dynamics of an embedded metal cluster
(Na) in a rare gas matrix (Ar). The model employs a microscopic description of three basic ingredients:
cluster valence electrons, cluster ionic cores, and raregas atoms. The cluster electrons are treated within
time-dependent density functional theory (DFT). The cluster ions are treated classically. The raregas atoms
are also treated as classical particles together with their dynamical polarizability as intrinsic degree of free-
dom. This model allows to handle a large variety of dynamical situations at the side of the cluster, including
electron emission when non linear excitations are considered. The cluster electrons can be treated at 2 lev-
els of approximation within the realm of DFT: fully quantum mechanical time-dependent local-density
approximation (TDLDA) and (semi-classical) Vlasov-LDA. It turns out that both approaches give results
which are qualitatively, sometimes even quantitatively, comparable. This holds in the stationary as well
as in the dynamical regime. Fully ﬂedged TDLDA reproduces quite well experimental data and previous
quantum chemistry approaches. The semi-classical approach also provides an acceptable description for
larger raregas matrices, which is to some extend a surprise in view of the subtle energetic balance in these
systems.

The semi-classical approach becomes particularly suited when non-linear excitations are considered. It
presently provides the simplest and practically only way to deal with dynamical correlations of the clus-
ter electrons. This is achieved by complementing the original Vlasov equation by a Boltzmann- ¨Uhling-
Uhlenbeck collision term yielding the Vlasov- ¨Uhling-Uhlenbeck (VUU) model. The collisional correla-
tions induce signiﬁcant differences between the Vlasov and VUU approaches when a sufﬁciently large
energy is deposited in the system, for free clusters as well as for embedded ones. The test cases considered
make it desirable to account for these dynamical correlations also in a quantum mechanical context. This
is, however, an extremely difﬁcult task still under development. In the mean time the VUU approach has
proven to provide a valuable tool for investigations of the non linear dynamics of simple metal clusters
embedded in a rare gas matrix. Further explorations of the various competing phenomena are underway.

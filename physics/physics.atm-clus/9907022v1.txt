INTRODUCTION

Weakly bound atomic and molecular clusters represent an interesting and growing ﬁeld of research in
both chemistry and physics [1]. They are useful to understand the evolution of the properties from
microscopic systems to bulk matter. Moreover, they generate alluring questions whose answers are
not trivial due to the important interplay between dynamical and geometrical factors in the cluster
description [2]. Among the most studied systems, rare gas clusters possess a rich and intriguing
set of properties directly related to the weakness of the interaction between their costituent atoms
[1]. The shallow well of their interaction potential energy surface (PES) allows the rare gas atoms
in a cluster to have large amplitude vibrational motions, therefore sampling all the features of the
PES itself, and precluding the use of the usual harmonic approximation to describe their vibrational
energy levels [3].

Moreover, the clusters of the lightest rare gases undergo a solid-liquid transition at tempera-
tures of the order of few kelvins, so they represent good candidates as a medium where reactions
can take place, allowing to study and develop low temperature chemistry. Unfortunately, a direct
spectroscopic study of the droplets of rare gases to acquire accurate information about their internal
dynamics is not easy to carry out, due to the absence of any chromophoric unit [1]. Furthermore,
molecular beam experiments generate a to low concentration of small clusters to allow neutron
scattering studies of the internal structure.

Recently, after the discovery that rare gas clusters can easily pick up one or more atomic and
molecular impurities [4], attention has been paid to study the eﬀect of the impurity on the cluster
and vice versa [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. These studies focused especially on the spectroscopic properties of the
impurity in the cluster medium, as a tool to probe the dynamics of the cluster itself. The necessity to
supplement the experimental spectroscopic results with an interpretation of the measured properties
has recently renewed the theoretical interest on these species. The test of the accuracy of the available
PES describing the interaction between the various atoms and molecules, and the calculation of the
eﬀect on the measured spectroscopic quantities of the increase of the dimension of the cluster ( i.e.
the number of rare gas atoms) are the most frequent computational studies [8, 10].

Among the rare gas atoms, 4He owes its importance to the strong quantum features it displays in
clusters and in liquid bulk at low temperatures [1]. These features are responsible for the macroscopic
superﬂuid behavior of 4He, that manifests itself in the total absence of viscosity and in the ability
to quickly transport the heat from a source to the surronding matter [11]. A recent experiment
on the OCS molecule absorbed in small 4He clusters has deﬁnitively shown that superﬂuidity can
be found even in microscopic aggregates, putting to an end a long debate [12]. Moreover, the low
temperature of these clusters can help spectroscopic studies on large molecules: the electronic spectra
of the aminoacids tryptophan and tyrosine were simpliﬁed by cooling their vibrational motion inside
an 4He droplet [13], llowing an easier interpretation of the experimental results. While alkali and
alkali-earth atoms are adsorbed on 4He clusters and then investigated by electronic spectra [14, 15],
all other impurities, studied by means of infra-red spectroscopy, reside inside the clusters themselves
[6, 12], and strongly perturbate their structure and properties. This diﬀerence is due to the weaker
or stronger interactions between the helium atom and the doping molecule than between two helium
atoms. Diﬀerent information on the total dynamics of these aggregates could be extracted if the
impurity pertubates only slightly the cluster, or even if, when attached to the droplet, it generates
a system whose global properties can be studied by means of microwave or infra-red techniques.

2

Recently, a high accuracy PES for the helium-hydride ion interaction has become available [16]:
the main features of this interaction potential are the small depth (about 4 cm−1), and the large
value of the distance where the minimum is located (about 13 bohr). These features show themselves
in the wide amplitude motion of the dimer ( the mean value for the 4He-H− distance is about 22
bohr), and in the long tail of the vibrational ground state wave function. An interesting property
of this quantum system is given by the existence of an excited rotational state with J=1 [16]. The
weak interaction between He and H− makes the hydride anion a good candidate for studies on the
He clusters weakly perturbed by an impurity. Due to the presence of a negative charge that is able
to polarize the helium atom, this system should have a ﬁnite dipole moment, hence to be microwave
active. Moreover, because of the small mass diﬀerence between 4He and H−, the spectroscopic
techniques should probe the quantum motion of the whole system. This could be the case also for
clusters containing more helium atoms, allowing, as stated before, to collect diﬀerent information
about the quantum dynamics of these aggregates.

In this work we studied both the energetics and structures of the ground state of the 4HeN H−
clusters using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. During the last few years, these methods
have been proved to give quite accurate information even for highly quantum systems like helium
clusters [17, 18, 19]. The main goal of this study is to obtain a clear picture of the relative motion
and distribution between the 4He and the H− species, with a special emphasis on the location of
the H− impurity with respect to the 4HeN moiety.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II contains the description of the
theoretical approach, of the interaction potentials used and few comments about the Monte Carlo
simulations. Section III contains the discussion of the Monte Carlo results, while section IV reports
our conclusions and possible future directions of this study.

2 METHODS

In atomic units, the Hamiltonian operator for any 4HeN H− clusters containing N 4He atoms and
one H− ion is

where V (R) is the interaction potential and R is a point in conﬁguration space. Here, we assume a
pair potential of the form

where rij is the distance between the i-th and j-th helium atom, while ri is the distance between
the i-th helium atom and the hydride ion. In this work, for VHeHe(rij ) we employ the recent Tang-
Toennies-Yiu (TTY) pair potential [20] that is not based on any kind of empirical information. This
choice allows us to directly compare our results with the recent ones obtained by Lewerenz [19],
who used this pair potential to compute energetics and structure of various small 4HeN clusters. To
obtain the pair potential between He and H− we ﬁtted the accurate Full CI results by Bendazzoli,
[16] employing an analytical form tailored to approximate with similar
Evangelisti and Passarini
accuracy all the three regions of the potential energy curve:

r < 10 bohr

r4

This approach diﬀers from the one used by Bendazzoli et al.
in their work, since they chose to
interpolate their data using exponential splines instead of ﬁtting them with any analytical model.
To ﬁt the 19 computed values of the interaction potential with our analytical model, we used the
Levenberg-Marquard algorithm, imposing analytically the continuity between the functions at 10 and
20 bohr. The parameters obtained by means of this procedure are (in atomic units): a1 = 1.303648,
a2 = −1.297418, a3 = −0.7503146, a4 = 0.00001989, a5 = 0.000012769, a6 = 0.313155, a7 = 13.0,
a8 = −0.00001467 and a9 = 0.736841. Figure 1 shows both the ﬁtted VHeH− (r) and the TTY
VHeHe(r) potentials. From Fig. 1, one can note that the two potentials have quite diﬀerent well
depth and location of the minimum: these results can be explained remembering that H− is very
diﬀuse, and that for this reason the attractive charge-induced dipole interaction can occur only
for large internuclear separation. Therefore, the well depth should be in principle quite small. In
this work we do not introduce any kind of information about three-body forces: while for pure
helium clusters one can use the standard Axilrod-Teller term [21] to augment the pair potential
approximation, to our knowledge similar information are not available for the 4He2H− trimer.

To approximate the ground state wave functions for these systems, we employed the commonly

used pair product form [18]

and no one-body part was used. This fact guarantees that we do not introduce any center-of-mass
kinetic energy component in the description of the cluster, avoiding us the burden of subtracting
it to obtain the internal energy of the system. Both the ψ(r) and φ(r) functions have the same
analytical form

ψ(r) = φ(r) = exp[−

p5
r5 −

p3
r3 −

p2
r2 − p1r − p0ln(r)]

[18] except for the presence
This form is identical to the one employed by Rick, Lynch and Doll
of the new term −p3/r3 that was previously used by Barnett and Whaley [17] in their study of
helium clusters. During the preliminary stages of our work, this term was found to improve sensibly
the variational energy of the wave function, and to have a positive impact on the stability of the
optimization.

The chosen form for the trial wave function makes impossible to compute analytically the matrix
elements of the Hamiltonian operator, and numerical methods must be used to obtain the energy
and other mean values for a given trial wave function. The variational Monte Carlo method is well
suited for this goal since it requires only the evaluation of the trial wave function, its gradient, and
its Laplacian. Since this and other Monte Carlo methods are well described in the literature [22],
we refer the reader to it and to our previous work in this ﬁeld for the details. However, it is relevant
to point out that all the mean values were computed by means of the general integral

and f (R) = Ψ2
T (R) for VMC, while f (R) = ΨT (R)Ψ0(R) for DMC. In VMC calculations, Eq. 8
gives exactly the expectation values of the O operator over the trial wave function ΨT , while in
DMC simulations Eq. 8 gives only an improved estimate of the value, but not the exact one. This
is true for all the O operators that do not commute with the Hamiltonian.

As to our general strategy to optimize the trial wave functions for the clusters studied, we usually
select the parameters of the exponential part in Eq. 7 by minimizing the estimate of the variance
of the local energy over a ﬁxed sample of walkers

All the VMC optimizations, and the VMC and DMC simulations were carried out using at least
5000 walkers; all the DMC simulations were run employing a time step of 200 hartree−1 and the
accuracy of the results was checked running few more simulations with smaller time steps to ensure
that the time step bias was negligible for all the expectation values.
The wave functions are available from the authors upon request.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In order to check our code, we carried out DMC simulations on the small systems 4He2, 4He3 and
4He4 employing the parameter listed in Ref.
[18] for the trial wave functions. Our DMC results,
-0.00089(1) cm−1 for 4He2, -0.08784(7) cm−1 for 4He3 and -0.3886(1) cm−1 for 4He4, are in optimal
[19]. As far as 4HeH− is concerned, we
agreement with the results obtained by Lewerenz in Ref.
optimized a wave function of the form of Eq. 7 obtaining -0.36987(8) cm−1 as mean energy. Using
this trial wave function we obtained a DMC energy of -0.3969(4) cm−1, that appears to be in good
agreement with the result of -0.4000 cm−1 obtained by Bendazzoli et al.
[16] for the J=0 case.
The remaining small discrepancy is due to the diﬀerent method we used to obtain an analytical
representation of the interaction potential, and show the accuracy of the ﬁtted potential.

These results allow a ﬁrst comparison between 4He2 and 4HeH−: although the well depth of
the interaction potential energy between two helium atoms is almost twice the well depth of the
HeH− potential, and the reduced mass of 4HeH− is smaller than the one of 4He2, the total energies
diﬀer by more than two orders of magnitude favoring the stability of 4HeH−. This outcome can
be explained noticing that the HeH− potential has a longer asymptotic decay and a shallower well
than the He2 potential. These features reﬂect themselves in a narrower wave function and a smaller
mean distance between 4He and H− than between 4He and 4He.

Having tested our code, we optimized a trial wave function for the smallest cluster 4He2H−
starting from the parameters of the wave functions of the two dimers 4He2 and 4HeH−. Since
this initial wave function was a crude approximation to the ground state, instead of using a VMC

5

distribution of walkers to carry out the parameter optimization, we employed a DMC simulation to
select the conﬁgurations. This alternative way, although seldom used, has the advantage to push
the distribution towards the correct one, biasing the selection of the parameters of the trial wave
function toward better ones. After a couple of optimization steps using the DMC distributions, the
wave function parameters had roughly converged, allowing us to use VMC simulations to compute
mean values and to select the new conﬁgurations to carry out the optimization procedure itself for
this small system.

For all the 4HeN H− systems with N > 2 the wave function optimization was started using the
parameters of the cluster having one helium atom less. We found this choice to be a good initial
guess for the minimization procedure and a good distribution to select the set of conﬁgurations by
means of a VMC simulation. The VMC results obtained by means of the optimization of the trial
wave function for the 4HeN H− are shown in Table I 1.

Since our trial wave functions are only an approximation of the true ground state functions and al-
low to compute only approximate properties of these clusters, to project out all the remaining excited
state contributions we employed DMC simulations to sample the distribution f (R) = ΨT (R)Ψ0(R).
The DMC energy and potential mean values are shown in Table I 1 together with the VMC results.
Comparing DMC and VMC energy results, one can note that the percentage of total energy recov-
ered by the VMC wave functions decreases in monotonic fashion, starting from 96% for the N= 2
cluster and ending to 81% for the largest cluster N=12 studied in this work. At present, we are not
able to include any deﬁnitive explanation of this behaviour, but we feel that it could be due either
to the limitation of the model function itself or to the optimization procedure based on the variance
of the local energy, or both.

Diﬀerently from what has been noted in Ref.

[19] for the pure helium clusters, energies and
other mean values for the 4HeN H− systems converged quite easily even for the smallest clusters with
N ≤ 4.

From the results shown in Table I 1, supplemented with the DMC results by Lewerenz on pure

helium clusters, one can compute various interesting energetic quantities:

Eex(N ) = E4HeN − E4HeN −1H−

EH−

grow(N ) = E4HeN −1H− − E4HeN H−

EHe

grow(N ) = E4HeN −1 − E4HeN

Ebind(N ) = E4HeN − E4HeN H−

(11)

grow(N ) and EHe

where Eex(N ) represents the energy that is released exchanging an helium atom with the hydride
ion, EH−
grow(N ) the energes that are released adding an 4He to an already formed
4HeN −1H− cluster or 4HeN −1 cluster respectively, while Ebind(N ) is the binding energy of H− to
the 4HeN cluster. These quantities are shown in Figures 2 and 3 to allow a quick comparison,
together with the total energy and Egrow(N ) for the pure helium clusters obtained by Lewerenz.
We supplemented his results with the total energy for 4He11 (-7.288(3) cm−1), 4He12 (-8.746(7)
cm−1), 4He13 (-10.299(4) cm−1) computed in this study.

Similarly to the results obtained by Barnett and Whaley [5] in their work on helium clusters
containing an hydrogen molecule as impurity, from Figure 2 and 3 it is possible to note that the
energetics of these small 4HeN H− clusters is dominated by the presence of the H− ion. The total

6

energy of the 4HeN H− appears to be much lower than the energy of 4HeN . For the clusters we
studied, both Ebind(N ) and Egrow(N ) increase almost linearly with the number of helium atoms.
This is an expected result for Egrow(N ) since, if no three-body contribution to the potential energy is
present, the total energy of a cluster should be roughly proportional to the number of pairs present.
As far as Ebind(N ) is concerned, its almost linear behavior cannot be explained by means of a
similar reasoning; this outcome could be easily rationalised if H− were solvated by the He atoms.
Unfortunatly this appears to be hardly possible, due to the quite diﬀerent well minimum location
of the two potentials.

To obtain information about the structure of doped clusters, during the DMC simulations we

collected the radial distribution R(r) from the center of mass for both 4He and H−

and from the geometrical center of the cluster

(15)

for the H− ion. We chose to show only R(r) with respect to the geometrical center, since the same
quantity computed with respect to the center of mass does not introduce any new information.

Comparing the He radial density distributions shown in Figure 4 with the same proﬁles obtained
by Lewerenz [19], it is possible to note that they appear quite similar except for our three-body
cluster, i.e. 4He2H−. The He density distribution for this cluster shows a maximum around 5.30
bohr, but there is no trace of the rise of the density for small distances from the center that can be
seen in the case of 4He3. Nevertheless, the plot of Figure 4 shows that He can occupy the geometrical
center position, i.e. 4He2H− in its ground state can be found in the linear geometry where the H−
ion is external to the 4He2 moiety. Increasing the number of He atoms present in the cluster, the
density near the cluster center rises toward the bulk value, represented in Figure 4 by the horizontal
dotted line. Similarly to the pure He clusters, the helium atoms appear to be completely delocalized
with no indication of any shell ﬁlling structure.

From the H− density distributions shown in Figure 5, one can note the peaked distribution of
the impurity with respect to the shallower proﬁle of the He atoms, and that, upon increasing the
number of helium atoms in the cluster, the H− is pushed toward larger distances from the center.
Moreover, Figure 5 shows that the penetration of H− decreases in a fairly monotonic fashion. The
only exception to this behavior is the smallest cluster 4He2H−: its distribution shows a rise beyond
statistical ﬂuctuation for a distance from the center less than the minimum located around 4.1 bohr.
This result indicates that in the 4He2H− cluster the linear geometry where H− lies between the

7

He atoms plays a signiﬁcant role in the description of the total motion, although H− has a larger
probability to lie 10 bohr far from the center of the cluster. Concluding, except for the smallest
cluster of the series, the impurity is not solvated by the 4He atoms, having a small probability
to be found near the center of the cluster. Analogous conclusions can be obtained by the density
distributions computed respect to the center of mass of the cluster.

∞

The pair distribution functions P (r) of the 4He-4He and 4He-H− distances are shown in Figures
0 p(r)r2dr = NHe. Again, the
6 and 7, respectively. These distributions are normalized such that
[19], showing a
He-He distribution has many similarities with the same quantity computed in Ref.
R
short range structure given by the sharp boundary hole around each He atom and a long decaying
tail for large distances. Moreover, for N≥ 10, our pair distributions show a weak shoulder around
12-13 bohr; the onset of this peculiarity of the He-He pair distribution was already noted by Barnett
and Whaley [17] for 4He13 and 4He14 in their work and explained by means of the appearence of the
second-nearest-neighbor coordination shell. This cannot be the case for our N=10-12 clusters, where
the icosahedral shell ﬁlling is not even completed. A similar feature seems to appear for 4He10 in
the pair distribution shown by Lewerenz in his work on pure clusters [19]. We interpret this feature
as due to the presence of a light residual of an almost icosahedral structure of the clusters, i.e. an
4He does not have only ﬁrst neighbors. Moreover, we suspect this trait to be emphasized by the
light deformation of the 4HeN moiety distribution due to the impurity resident on its surface. The
presence of this deformation for all the studied clusters is supported by the almost linear behavior
of Ebind shown in Figure 2, and by the fact that only small changes take place in the form of the
He-H− distributions (Figure 7) upon increasing of the number of atoms in the clusters.

From the sampled density and pair distributions, displayed in Figures 4-7, various mean distances
can be computed by simple one dimensional integration. In Table II 2, we report the values for
< rHeH− >, < rHeHe >, < rHeCM >, and < rH− CM >. Comparing our < rHeHe > and < rHeCM >
results with the mean values computed by Lewerenz for the clusters containing the same total number
of particles, we note that our doped clusters have a more compact structure of the 4He atom moiety
than the pure ones, certainly due to the presence of the strongly binding impurity. Both mean
distances show a sharp decrease up to N=5 where a minimum is located, and a light increase going
toward larger N. This behavior can be explained easily by means of standard arguments: going from
N=2 to N=5 the mean interaction between the particles increases due to their increased number,
giving rise to a stronger binding between them. For N greater than 5 the cluster becomes larger due
to the addition of another 4He atom, in spite of the augmented total interaction energy. A similar
behavior is displayed by the < rHeH− > mean values, and it can be rationalized by means of the
same arguments.

As far as < rH−CM > is concerned, its monotonic increase going toward larger N can be explained
by the joined eﬀect of the increased dimension of the 4He atoms moiety and of the displacement of
the center of mass location inside the moiety itself, due to a simple mass eﬀect.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this work we presented the ﬁrst quantum-mechanical study of an anionic impurity in 4He clusters.
Our results show the H− ion to be located on the surface of the cluster, except for the 4He2H− cluster
where it has a ﬁnite probability to be found between the two He atoms in a linear geometry. Our
total energy values show that the interaction between helium and the impurity is an important

8

component of the total energy of the system, while our mean geometrical values show that the
helium moiety is slightly contracted with respect to the pure cluster case. We consider this fact
to be due to the form of the interaction potential between an helium atom and the impurity, and
especially to its longer tail respect to the He-He potential.

As far as the possibility to record a microwave spectrum of these systems is concerned, the
location of the impurity on the cluster surface seems to indicate that this is possible, at least in
principle. In fact, the cluster structures resemble mostly the structure of a heteronuclear diatomic
molecule whose lightest atom carries a negative charge, and whose heaviest atom has a farly large
radius.

In this work, we approximated the total interaction potential as a sum of pair components,
therefore excluding any non-addictive eﬀect in the description of the systems. The three-body
interaction between two He and one H− could play a major role than in the pure He case in deﬁning
both energetics and structure of the clusters, due to the fact that it is due to a charge-induced
dipole-induced dipole interaction.

Moreover, the eﬀects of the isotopic substitution of H− with D− on the structure and energetics
are worth to study, since they were found quite important for HeH− [16]. We expect this eﬀect to
be especially important for the excited rotational states of these complexes, so we are planning to
extend our study in this new direction, i.e. to compute ground state properties for clusters containing
D−, and rotational excited states for both the doping impurities [23].

The dynamic orientational order-disorder transition of clusters consisting of octahedral AF6
molecules is formulated in terms of symmetry-adapted rotator functions. The transition from a
higher-temperature body-centered-cubic phase whose molecules are orientationally disordered at
their sites to lower-temperature, monoclinic, orientationally-ordered phase is a two-step process:
ﬁrst, at temperatures well below the limit of stability for the liquid, a transition occurs to a partially
ordered monoclinic phase driven by the rotational-vibrational coupling. This transition has two local
minima in the free energy, and hence behaves like a ﬁnite-system counterpart of a ﬁrst-order transi-
tion. Further lowering of the temperature initiates another transition, to an orientationally-ordered
base-centered monoclinic structure. This last transition is dominated by rotational-rotational inter-
action and is found from simulations to be continuous. The temperature of this transition predicted
by the analytic theory presented here for a 59-molecule cluster of T eF6, 27K, is in good agreement
with the 30K result of canonical Monte Carlo calculations.

Below the freezing point, the plastic phases of molecular substances are known to form highly symmetrical lattices
with orientationally disordered molecules [1]. As the temperature of the disordered substance is still lowered, a phase
transition to a more orientationally-ordered phase takes place. The new phase might have a crystal structure of lower
symmetry, characterized by long-range orientational order. This is called displacive-ordering transition. Similar struc-
tural transformations have been also detected in small, free clusters consisting of rigid octahedral molecules SF6 [2]
and T eF6 [3,4] and have been studied by numerical simulations [5–9] and experimentally [10,11]. The change between
phases may be continuous or discontinuous depending on the interaction potential. However, simulations of clusters
always produce smooth behavior in the sense that clusters in diﬀerent phases coexist over a range of temperatures
and pressures, regardless of the order of the transition in the thermodynamic, large-N limit.
In many cases, the
crystal forms observed depend strongly on the conditions of production, thus leading to diﬀerent interpretations of
what should be the ﬁnal structures of the clusters at low temperatures. Structures such as triclinic, monoclinic and
hexagonal were reported for the same material [6]. In our previous simulations, we have shown that the ﬁnite size
of clusters causes rotational [7] and strong surface eﬀects [12], appearance of vibrational-rotational coupling, none of
which are expected in bulk systems of the same symmetry.

Vibrational-rotational coupling was considered qualitatively to explain the two-step process of ordering in some
clusters of octahedral molecules, Oh symmetry, as the temperature decreases [4,8]. Below the melting temperature,
those clusters assume a body-centered cubic structure bcc, Oh symmetry, and orientational disorder of the molecules
[2,5,3]. Simulations show [13] that this transition involves passage between two forms at diﬀerent local minima in
the free energy, and hence is the apparent counterpart of a ﬁrst-order transition. Whether these two minima remain
apart or converge as N → ∞ is an unsettled question [2,3]. A temperature decrease drives a phase transition from the
orientationally disordered bcc structure to an orientationally ordered monoclinic phase, C2h. Since no normal mode of
Oh carries the group directly to C2h this transition could occur in two steps: ﬁrst, the bcc transforms into a partially
ordered monoclinic phase driven by rotational-translational coupling. Second, after a further temperature decrease,
another transition to an orientationally ordered phase without change of the symmetry of the lattice sites takes place.
In the present paper we analyze analytically the dynamic orientational order in clusters of rigid octahedral molecules
of type AF6 to determine the contribution of various interactions to the total potential and the nature of the
temperature-driven solid-solid transformation of plastic clusters. The symmetry of the molecules, Oh, and the
molecular sites in the cluster, Oh or C2h, are taken into account explicitly in our analysis, based on the theory
of orientationally-disordered crystals [14,15]. The site position of each molecule is determined by the Cartesian coor-
dinates of its mass center at A. Throughout the paper we refer to (i) a space (laboratory) axis system XY Z, ﬁxed at
the cluster’s center of mass; (ii) a nonrotating system X ′Y ′Z ′ parallel to XY Z but with its origin translating with
the molecular center of mass; (iii) a rotating, body-ﬁxed system xyz. For rigid molecules, these axes coincide with
the principle axes of inertia.

The translation of a molecule is separable as the motion of the molecular center of mass in the XY Z coordinates.
The xyz orientation in the XY Z system is given with Ω ≡ (θ, φ, ψ), where θ and φ are the ordinary polar coordinates
of the z axis in the XY Z system and ψ is an angle in the xy-plane measuring the rotation clockwise about the z axis.
The molecular orientation in orientationally-disordered high-T crystals has been presented in terms of symmetry-
adapted rotator functions used by James and Keenan [16] to describe the orientational phase of methane with tetra-
hedral symmetry.

Let us consider an octahedral molecule n in its initial orientation Ωn where the molecular axes coincide with the

Unlike bulk crystals, the cubic structure of a free cluster is broken at the cluster surface.

In what follows, we
consider the symmetry of the volume molecules, deﬁned as molecules having all the neighbors required by a speciﬁc
point group. We neglect the symmetry-breaking associated with the surface molecules, which belong to a diﬀerent
group, if any. The separate description of the surface and the volume limits the analysis. In the closing remarks, we
discuss a possible correction to this assumption.

The orientational changes at a cubic site are also expressed in terms of site-symmetry-adapted functions [15]:

where the superscript τ = (G, Γ, p, ρ) indicates the irreducible representations Γ of the group G, p distinguishes

symmetry-adapted functions represent a complete basis in the Ω(θ, φ, ψ)-space. The l = 4 manifold of this system
reduces to the representation A1g, Eg, T1g, T2g under G ≡ Oh and to the representations 5Ag and 4Bg under G ≡ C2h.

4 = [±i0.707, m = ±2] for Oh, T2g, 3, 1.

The largest contribution to the crystal ﬁeld is that of the A1g component of the l = 4 manifold.

At low temperatures, clusters of AF6 molecules adopt a monoclinic structure C2h. All coeﬃcients ατ are equal to

1 for the ﬁve-fold representation Ag (m = 0, ±2, ±4) and for the four-fold representation Bg (m = ±1, ±3).

An arbitrary molecular orientation Ωn′ with respect to the initial one Ωn is obtained by a rotation speciﬁed with
l (Ωb) deﬁned in the

Molecular and site symmetry considerations restrict the number of terms in the sums, thus reducing the computa-

The value of p = 0 corresponds to a rigid lattice (no displacements of the molecular center of mass). For this case

we get only rotational-rotational interaction between two molecules with µ 6= (0, 0) and µ′ 6= (0, 0):

The cluster transforms from a disordered cubic to an ordered monoclinic structure at Tc that is the temperature
at which the free energies of the two forms are equal. In order to calculate Tc we also need the total ﬁeld acting

x = Z −
of x does not depend on the components of the rotator function ∆. Two phases of clusters coexist in equal amounts
or with equal frequency when their free energies are equal. In the limit of N → ∞, a phase transition occurs at Tc,
which is the point where an eigenvalue of [ˆ1T + x(T )FT[ ˆJ] vanishes, if the transition is continuous. The temperature
dependence of x is very weak which means that the Curie-Weiss law χ0 = x(T )/(T − Tc) is valid for negative diagonal
elements of ˆJ. The transition point Tc occurs at the largest value of the matrix for the representations allowed by the
symmetry of the system, i.e. Tc = max[−x ˆJ].

As an example, we have applied this group-theoretical approach to the case of a cluster containing 59 T eF6 molecules
and have compared the results to those published in [7–9]. In order to account for the broken symmetry at the cluster
surfaces, we use sum over the nearest neighbors. Since the molecules of type AF6 have no low-order electrostatic
moments, the Coulomb contribution to the Lennard-Jones potential can be neglected, see ﬁg.2 in [4].

We compare the rotational-rotational contributions, Eq.(0.13), with their vibrational-rotational counterparts, (0.17),
for the T eF6 molecule with the nearest neighbors located at sites with cubic or monoclinic symmetry. For the purpose,
we determine the vibrational spectrum, the crystal ﬁeld (0.16), and the rotational matrix (0.14).The CERN Library
[20] is used to compute he elements of (0.14). The contribution from l = l′ = 4 is the largest. The ˆJ matrices in a

The largest value of ˆJ is obtained for the representation A1g, so we choose as an order parameter the rotator
functions for this representation and expand the free energy F in terms of the corresponding rotator functions. A1g
is the only common representation for Oh and C2h. To ﬁnd correlation of Oh and C2h we carry out the correlation in
two steps: ﬁrst, pass from Oh to D4h and then imply the table for D4h to go on to C2h [15].

The coeﬃcients υR necessary to compute the crystal ﬁeld (0.16) are calculated from Eq.(0.15). We get for the cubic
Oh = −7.98 in the approximation of the nearest eight neighbors. For the monoclinic structure, C2h, this
Oh = −0.61. From Eq.(0.2) we obtain for the octahedral molecule of T eF6: g0=1.98 and g4=1.29.

symmetry υR
coeﬃcient is υR

In the approximation of the nearest neighbors interaction we have determined the energy per molecule: in Oh , the
rotational-rotational energy is 4meV and the vibrational-rotational is 1meV ; in C2h, these values are 1.2meV and
0.02meV , respectively. The conclusion is that the vibrational-rotational interaction can be neglected in the ordering
of molecules on monoclinic sites, so that the lower-temperature transition is entirely driven by rotational ordering
and that transition is continuous even in small systems. However on cubic sites, motion of the molecular centers of
mass must be taken into account, and the transition acts at least in small systems like it is ﬁrst-order. The highly
degenerate state of an octahedral molecule in the octahedral environment is resolved by a distortion of the cluster if
the model requires a rigid molecule. In this case we must deal with the Jahn-Teller eﬀect that distorts the cluster.
This implies that a transition to a lower-symmetry structure is initiated. The larger value of the rotational-rotational
interaction, however, leads to a partial ordering of the molecules which we clearly see [8] in the thermodynamically
less favored state of clusters of small size. The transition from a cubic to monoclinic structure is resolved with the
appearance of the representation of Eg in Dh which is equivalent to condensation of an active mode.

Taking into account the rotational-rotational interaction in the total ﬁeld (0.19) for the orientational ordering in C2h
we obtain Tc = max [−x ˆJ] = 27K. This is in a good agreement with the result (∼ 30K) computed in the molecular
dynamics simulations [7]. Thus we show that the choice of cubic rotator functions (0.16) as an order parameter is
suitable for describing the mechanism of phase changes.

A ﬁnal comment is that the theory of discrete point groups used in the present work sets limits on handling at
once the surface and volume symmetries. However, the approach of continuous symmetry measures as developed by
Zabrodsky, Pinsky and Avnir [21,22] might make it possible to bring together the surface and the volume symmetry
properties.

Abstract

Using lattice eﬀective ﬁeld theory, we study the ground state binding energy of N distinct

particles in two dimensions with equal mass interacting weakly via an attractive SU (N )-symmetric

short range potential. We ﬁnd that in the limit of zero range and large N , the ratio of binding

energies BN /BN −1 approaches the value 8.3(6).

INTRODUCTION

We consider the ground state of N distinct particles in two dimensions with equal mass

interacting weakly via an attractive SU(N)-symmetric short range potential.

Since the

ground state is completely symmetric this is equivalent to the problem of N weakly-bound

identical bosons. The self-bound two-dimensional system with a realistic van der Waals

potential is relevant to the properties of adatoms on surfaces. However in this work we

focus on universal features that arise as the range of the interaction goes to zero,

V (~x1, · · · , ~xN ) → C

Let BN be the ground state binding energy of the N-particle system in the zero range

limit. The ﬁrst calculation of B3/B2 was given in [1]. The precision of this calculation was

improved by [2], and most recently a precise determination, B3/B2 = 16.522688(1), was given

in [3]. There have also been studies of the four- and ﬁve-particle systems [4, 5, 6]. But range

corrections for these studies appear to be substantial, and the ﬁrst precise determination of

B4/B2 in the zero range limit was only recently given in [7], yielding a value of B4/B2 =

197.3(1).

The behavior of BN in the large-N limit was recently discussed in [3]. They showed that

due to the weakening of the attractive coupling at short distance scales, the large-N droplet

system could be treated classically. This yielded a prediction for the ratio of the binding

energies in the large-N limit,

In [8] the N-particle system for N ≤ 7 was investigated using diﬀusion Monte Carlo with

both a Lennard-Jones potential and a more realistic helium-helium potential. However the

results showed that the range corrections were too large to allow for a determination of

BN /BN −1 for large N.

In this paper we study the N-particle system using lattice eﬀective ﬁeld theory. The

organization of our paper is as follows. We ﬁrst discuss the renormalization of the interaction

coeﬃcient in the two-particle system. We discuss renormalization in the continuum with a

sharp momentum cutoﬀ and then on the lattice. Next we address two features of the large-N

limit. The ﬁrst is a rescaling technique that cancels some of the nonzero range corrections

from the ratio BN /BN −1. The other is an overlapping interaction problem that occurs

when many particles lie within a region the size of the range of the potential. We show

that for any realistic lattice simulation this eﬀect needs to be regulated in some manner.

Using lowest-order lattice eﬀective ﬁeld theory, we compute BN /BN −1 for N ≤ 10 using

a heat bath/Metropolis algorithm with endpoint correlation function importance sampling.

Extrapolating to the limit N → ∞, we ﬁnd the result

II. TWO-PARTICLE SYSTEM AND RENORMALIZED COUPLING

We begin by reviewing the two-particle system in the continuum formalism with a sharp

cutoﬀ on the magnitude of the momentum. The diagrams which contribute to two-particle

scattering are shown in Fig. 1. In order that the bound state pole in the rest frame occurs

III. RATIOS IN THE LARGE-N LIMIT

In the large-N limit some of the error at ﬁnite Λ can be cancelled from the ratio BN /BN −1.
The cutoﬀ dependence appears in the combination mBN Λ−2. Therefore if we measure
binding energies while keeping mBN Λ−2 ﬁxed, then cutoﬀ error independent of N cancels

in the ratio.

Let BN (Λ) be the measured binding energy of the N-particle ground state at cutoﬀ scale

Λ. Conceptually it is simplest to regard m and B2 as ﬁxed quantities while we vary Λ.

Therefore so long as |f (z)| ≪ 1, the large-N ratio of binding energies can be measured

reliably. Other range corrections which do not grow linearly with N will cancel in the ratio

as we take N → ∞.

In our Monte Carlo lattice simulations it is more convenient to regard m and Λ as ﬁxed

quantities while varying B2. We deﬁne B2(z, N) implicitly by

BN (Λ(z, N))
BN −1(Λ(z, N − 1))

mBN (B2(z, N)) · Λ−2 = z.

We are changing the overall physical scale when we change B2, and so we work with ratios

BN /B2. The analog of the result (23) is

IV. OVERLAPPING RANGE AND IMPLICIT N -BODY INTERACTION

Large range corrections can occur when many particles lie within a region the size of the

range of the potential. The problem is most severe when all N particles lie in this localized

region, and the potential energy is ampliﬁed by a factor of N(N − 1)/2. For a continuum

potential with a repulsive core, the result is a deep hole at the center of the multiparticle

wavefunction and a tendency towards underbinding or unbinding. At lowest order in lattice

eﬀective ﬁeld theory the eﬀect goes in the opposite direction. A spike forms at the center

This potential energy can be regarded as an implicit N-body contact interaction produced

by overlapping two-body interactions.

In the continuum limit we know that the importance

of this N-body contact interaction is suppressed by many powers of the small parameter

z = mBN Λ−2. However the situation at ﬁnite Λ can be quite diﬀerent from the continuum

limit if the potential energy per particle for the localized state

V. DISCRETE HUBBARD-STRATONOVICH TRANSFORMATION

There are several ways to deal with the large implicit N-body contact interaction. On

the lattice there is one method which is particularly convenient. This is to write the two-

body interaction using a discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation [10].

It turns out

that the implicit N-body contact interaction for N ≥ 3 is regulated by the temporal lattice

spacing. We show how this happens.

For simplicity we show only the interaction part of the Hamiltonian. The exponential of

the two-body interaction at site ~n over a Euclidean time step at is

lattice site ~n. When K ≥ 3 but λ(K − 1) ≪ 1, we ﬁnd

VII. RESULTS

For each simulation we have computed roughly 2 · 105 successful heat bath/Metropolis

updates for each lattice site, split across four processors running completely independent

trajectories. Averages and errors were calculated by comparing the results of each processor.

We use a mass of m = 939 MeV and keep the spatial lattice spacing ﬁxed at a = (40 MeV)−1.

This corresponds with Λ = πa−1 ≃ 126 MeV and cutoﬀ energy m−1Λ2 = 16.8 MeV. We

adjust the two-particle binding energy B2 in order to study the ﬁnite cutoﬀ dependence.

For convenience we use the shorthand,

bN = BN (B2(N))/B2(N).

(53)

For each data point we increase the spatial length and temporal extent of the lattice until

the ﬁnite volume/time errors are clearly smaller than the statistical errors. The largest

lattice system we simulate is 9 × 9 × 260.

We have computed bN for N ≤ 10 for a wide range of values for B2 using the O(a4)-
improved action and at = (20 MeV)−1. The results are shown as a plot of ln(bN ) versus z

in Fig. 2. We see that there is considerable dependence on z. The dependence appears to

be roughly linear in z for 0.1 < z < 0.3, and we have drawn interpolating lines. We note

that since ln(bN ) and ln(bN −1) have approximately the same slope, most of the z dependence

cancels in the combination ln(bN ) − ln(bN −1). This suggests that f (z) as deﬁned in (21) is

small. Much of the systematic cutoﬀ errors can be cancelled in the ratio bN /bN −1by keeping

z the same for bN and bN −1. From Fig. 2 we see that bN /bN −1 is about 10 for 5 ≤ N ≤ 10.
Therefore scaling B2(N) proportional to 10−N should keep z approximately the same for

these values of N.

Next we calculated bN /bN −1 for N ≤ 10 using three diﬀerent actions. We compared the
standard action, the O(a2)-improved action, and the O(a4)-improved action, using at = (20
MeV)−1 and B2(N) = 2 · 102−N MeV. The results are shown in Fig. 3. We see about a 10%
variation among the three diﬀerent actions, with the O(a2)- and O(a4)-improved actions

agreeing better with each than with the standard action.

In Fig. 4 we plot bN /bN −1 using the O(a4)-improved action, at = (20 MeV)−1, and three
diﬀerent values of B2: B2(N) = 3 · 102−N MeV, 2 · 102−N MeV, and 1 · 102−N MeV. The

discrepancies for the diﬀerent values of B2 are at the 30% level for small N, but as expected

the errors decrease with increasing N.

We also studied the dependence of bN /bN −1 on the temporal lattice spacing at. We set
B2(N) = 2 · 102−N MeV and used the O(a4)-improved action with at = (16 MeV)−1, (20

interaction. Instead the importance of at is as an auxiliary regulator on the implicit N-body

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the two-dimensional N-particle system with short range attraction using

lowest-order lattice eﬀective ﬁeld theory. We discussed two aspects of the large-N limit. The

ﬁrst is a technique that uses large-N similarity under rescaling to cancel some of the nonzero

range corrections from the ratio BN /BN −1. The other is the problem of a large implicit

N-body contact interaction when many particles lie within a region the size of the range of

the potential. We regulated this implicit N-body contact interaction on the lattice using

a discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. Using a heat bath/Metropolis algorithm

with endpoint correlation function importance sampling we computed BN /BN −1 for N ≤ 10.

Extrapolating to the large-N we found

FIG. 6: Cumulative data for bN /bN −1. We draw two best ﬁt curves with up to quadratic depen-

dence on 1/N and show the known results for N = 3, 4, and ∞.

While we have measured the large-N limit of BN /BN −1 to within 10%, we relied on large-

N similarity under rescaling to keep the ﬁnite cutoﬀ errors in check. The z dependence

in Fig. 2 suggests that one needs to go beyond leading order to accurately describe all of

the physics at large N. This competition between eﬀective ﬁeld theory expansions and

the large-N limit presents an interesting theoretical challenge. Since there are no known

physical systems where we can experimentally measure the universal zero range behavior,

the coeﬃcients of the higher-dimensional operators must be set by numerical calculations.

One technique perhaps is to use numerical renormalization group matching to relate the

coeﬃcients of higher-dimensional operators for diﬀerent values of mB2Λ−2. However more

study would be needed to see if this is a viable technique.

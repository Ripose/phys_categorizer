Abstract

Relaxation processes following inner-valence ionization of a system can be modiﬁed dramatically

by embedding this system in a suitable environment. Surprisingly, such an environment can be

even composed of helium atoms, the most inert species available. As demonstrated by the examples

of Ne and Ca atoms embedded in He droplets, a fast relaxation process [Interatomic Coulombic

Decay (ICD)] takes place merely due to the presence of the He surroundings. We have computed

ICD widths for both 4HeN and 3HeN droplets doped with Ne and Ca and discuss the ﬁndings in

some detail. In the case of Ne, ICD is by far the dominating relaxation pathway. In Ca, atomic

Auger decay is also possible but ICD becomes a competitive relaxation pathway in the droplets.

Helium droplets have been attracting considerable attention due to their unique prop-

erties. We refer the reader to review papers describing the present state of the art of the

ﬁeld of helium droplets, its profound achievements and open questions [1, 2]. The broad

interest in He droplets derives from the recognition that they can easily pick up foreign

species. Numerous experimental and theoretical studies pursued several objectives such as

to gain a better insight into the properties of the pure He drops themselves as well as to

derive valuable information on dopants, taking advantage of the He droplets as an ultracold

and gentle matrix in high resolution spectroscopies.

Because of the weak impurity-helium interaction, properties of the impurity are usually

little aﬀected by the He surroundings. However, even minor changes, e.g. small shifts of

various transitions of a foreign atom due to embedding in a He droplet, are of crucial impor-

tance since they can shed additional light on the nature of the impurity-helium interaction

and are very helpful, for example, in predicting the impurity position in the droplet[3, 4, 5].

Cases where the He environment modiﬁes markedly the properties of a system embedded in

a He droplet attract special attention. To our knowledge only a few such cases have been

reported so far, notably in all of them the droplets were subject to ionization[6, 7].

Irradiation of doped droplets with femtosecond laser pulses causes a rich palette of charged

ions as a result of droplet disintegration via Coulomb explosion. Although singly charged

He atoms appear as well[8, 9] the cause for their appearance did not receive the attention

it deserves. One possibility of the He ions production is obviously the direct ionization

by intense laser pulses. Another way one might think of is much more exciting since it

reveals a high activity of the He environment in processes occurring in doped He droplets.

Here, the He ions are the outcome of a very eﬃcient relaxation pathway of highly excited

states of the foreign systems embedded in the droplets which is operative only due to the

presence of the He environment. This relaxation process is Interatomic Coulombic Decay

(ICD) [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].

Generally, relaxation of an inner-valence vacancy in an isolated atom proceeds radiatively

by emission of a photon, in contrast to a deeper core vacancy which decays by ejecting an

Auger electron. The situation can change drastically if neighboring atoms are present as pre-

dicted theoretically[10] and conﬁrmed experimentally[11, 12]. The presence of a neighboring

atom lowers the double ionization threshold of the system compared to that of the isolated

atom. If this threshold is now below the energy of the inner-valence hole state, a novel radia-

tionless decay channel opens. In the ICD process the initial inner-valence vacancy is ﬁlled by

an outer-valence electron from the same atomic site while the energy released is transferred

to ionize a neighboring subunit of the system. ICD may have dramatic consequences for a

system where it takes place making this system unstable towards fragmentation due to the

occurrence of two spatially separated charges.

ICD is an interatomic process in its nature and this makes its properties, in particular

the decay width ΓICD or equivalently the lifetime τICD of the inner-valence hole, strongly

environment dependent.

In the classical example of the 2s ionization of a Ne atom, the

2p → 2s relaxation energy of 26.91 eV is insuﬃcient for emitting another electron from this

atom. The Ne2s hole decays, therefore, radiatively in about 175 ps [17] corresponding to

Γrad of 3.8 µeV. On the other hand, if a neighboring Ne atom is present, the 26.91 eV are

suﬃcient to knock a 2p electron out of this neighboring Ne atom and to make ICD operative

[12, 13]. In the Ne dimer τICD is about 85 fs, more than 2000 times smaller than τrad! The

lifetime of the Ne2s vacancy reduces further to only a few femtoseconds if the excited Ne

atom is surrounded by several neighbors like it is the case in a NeN cluster [14, 15].

Interestingly, the above mentioned energy of 26.91 eV is also suﬃcient to ionize a neigh-

boring He atom. For this to occur, the minimal separation between He and Ne should be
RICD = 6.2 ˚A which is derived under the plausible assumption that the ionization energy of

He in the presence of the Ne ion is governed by electrostatic repulsion between both. Is the

3

‹
‹
presence of a by far more distant He atom which is less perturbing than Ne able to modify

considerably the decay of the Ne2s vacancy like it happens in Ne2? To answer this question
we have calculated Γpair
ICD(R) for a pair of Ne and He separated by R ≥ RICD using a recently
developed ab initio Fano-GF method[16]. The method represents a combination of a Fano

formalism for resonance widths, a Green’s Function method for solving a multielectron prob-

lem, and a Stieltjes imaging technique for renormalization of the discretized continuum (see

Ref. [16] for details). Together with the d-aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets for Ne and He [18] we used

continuum-like diﬀuse functions of s, p and d types[19] distributed between these atoms as

well as around He. The results are shown by the solid curve in Fig. 1. The dominance of
ICD over radiative decay at RICD (Γpair

ICD = 70µeV) and some larger R is apparent. This fact,

being striking by itself, is however of minor consequence for the diatomic NeHe cluster since

the probability to ﬁnd Ne and He at such large separations (more than twice the equilibrium

distance of the cluster) is negligible despite the ﬂoppiness of this system.

Being captured by a He droplet, Ne can be surrounded by tens, hundreds or even thou-

sands He atoms, many of them residing at suﬃciently large distances from the impurity to

make ICD of the Ne2s vacancy possible. Since the ICD performance increases with opening

new ICD channels, ICD is expected to be more and more pronounced as the droplet size

grows. The big size of a droplet is a serious obstacle for calculating ICD widths from ﬁrst

principles. Intuition suggests however that the interaction of a dopant with a He atom is
not strongly perturbed by other He atoms so that Γdrop
approximated by a sum of Γpair

ICD for doped droplets can be reliably
ICD for individual dopant–He pairs. The ab initio calculations

below support this view.

Using the Fano-GF method we have explicitly calculated Γclust

ICD for the most symmetric

NeHeN (N=1–4) clusters with Ne in the center. The He atoms were separated from Ne by
6.4 ˚A, a typical radius of the second coordination shell in He droplets doped with Ne (the

ﬁrst coordination shell is ICD-inactive). To keep the size of the problem tractable for the ab

initio method used, we had to reduce the quality of the basis set for He to d-aug-cc-pVTZ.

Excellent agreement between the results obtained and those derived by multiplication of
Γpair
ICD with N (see Fig. 2) strongly suggests the validity of the pairwise additivity of ICD

widths. Other clusters have also been studied leading to the same conclusions (see below).
Assuming pairwise additivity also in larger systems, we can now estimate Γdrop
ICD for
Ne@HeN droplets. Ne is known to locate in the center of both 4He and 3He droplets

[20, 21] as a consequence of a stronger Ne–He interaction compared to the He–He one.

The density distribution ρ of helium around Ne is spherically symmetric and we may write
Γdrop
ICD = 4π R ∞
ICD(r)ρ(r)r2d r, where R0 is a cutoﬀ radius below which the He atoms in
the droplets are ICD-inactive. Due to the combined eﬀect of the He environment, R0 dif-

R0 Γpair

fers slightly from RICD. To assess R0, we have calculated ionization thresholds in diﬀerent

NeHeN clusters, the largest one contains 18 He atoms distributed in two shells around the

central Ne. The double (Ne2p–He1s) and Ne2s ionization thresholds of these systems were

found to be lower than their counterparts in NeHe by up to 0.1 and 0.2 eV, respectively,
which results in R0 = 5.93˚A. These changes are consistent with the experimentally detected

ones of ionization thresholds of He[22] and impurities[23] in larger He droplets supporting

our results used to determine the cutoﬀ radius R0 in doped Ne@HeN droplets.

We have estimated Γdrop

ICD for several Ne@4HeN and Ne@3HeN droplets (in Fig. 3, circles
joined by red and blue lines, respectively) with 50 to 5000 He atoms using actual density

proﬁles of the doped droplets ρdop (ﬁlled circles) wherever possible and density proﬁles of

the pure droplets ρpure (open circles) otherwise. All density proﬁles mentioned here and

further on have been obtained by Barranco and co-workers within density functional theory

(see Refs.[21, 24] for details). Whenever ρpure had to be used (note that this is only the case
for 3HeN ) we considered R0 as a parameter serving to compensate for using the improper

density distribution. Once obtained in the case where both ρdop and ρpure were available, the
new R0 was then applied for all droplets with unknown ρdop. Γdrop

ICD exhibits similar behaviors

5

with N for both doped 4HeN and 3HeN droplets. It rises rapidly for small N approaching

a saturation limit of 1.8 meV (τICD=360 fs) and 1.4 meV (τICD=480 fs) at N ∼ 1000 in the

doped 4HeN and 3HeN droplets, respectively. Astonishingly, such drastic reductions of the

Ne2s vacancy lifetime to a sub-picosecond timescale compared to that in the isolated Ne

become possible due to the presence and with the active involvement of the He environment,

the most inert environment available.

The spectacular ability of He environment to modify dramatically the course of processes

occurring in highly excited species embedded in this environment is obviously not restricted

to Ne. Another interesting example is provided by doped Ca@HeN droplets. In contrast

to the Ne2s vacancy, the Ca3p vacancy in an isolated Ca atom can undergo Auger decay.

The 4s → 3p relaxation energy of 28.31 eV is more than suﬃcient for autoionizing an outer-

valence Ca4s electron resulting in Ca2+4s−2. This decay is characterized by a width of 0.58

meV according to our ab initio calculation using the Fano-GF method. Radiative decay of

the Ca3p vacancy is much less eﬃcient. The energy of 28.31 eV is high enough for ionizing

a neighboring He atom via the ICD mechanism. Irrespective of the direction of the Ca3p

orbital, the ICD widths in a CaHe pair for all Ca–He separations except for irrelevant short

ones are noticeably exceeded by ΓAuger (see Fig. 1).

What happens when Ca is ionized in a He droplet? Auger decay is inherently an intra-

atomic process and its properties are only weakly inﬂuenced by the very inert He environ-

ment. By contrast, ICD is an interatomic process in character and its eﬃciency grows with

additional He atoms attached. Thereby, not only the distances from Ca to individual He

atoms play a crucial role, but also the orientation of the Ca3pi (i = x, y, z) orbital. Ap-

parently, at a given distance the He atoms along the direction of a particular Ca3pi orbital
contribute most to the corresponding ICD width Γdrop
i ICD.

Ca is a remarkable element as far as its interaction with He droplets is concerned. Being

picked up by a 4He droplet Ca neither resides in the center nor is attached to surface of

the droplet. It occupies an intermediate position in a quite deep surface dimple[5, 25]. In

contrast to this, Ca sits in the center of a 3He droplet as predicted recently[26]. The various
Γdrop
i ICD are equal in Ca@3HeN given that the 3He distribution is isotropic, and slightly diﬀerent
in Ca@4HeN because the 4He distribution is not very anisotropic in the close vicinity of Ca

residing in a deep dimple.

ICD changes

with the number of He atoms let us ﬁrst consider three sets of small CaHeN (N =1–4)
clusters with distinct He arrangements. In the ﬁrst case Ca is placed 6 ˚A apart from the end
of a linear HeN chain with link size of 3.2 ˚A. These distances are the typical radius of the ﬁrst

coordination shell and the separation between two coordination shells in He droplets doped

with Ca, respectively. Our ab initio calculations show that all Γclust

the sums of ICD widths corresponding to the available diﬀerent CaHe pairs (see lower part
of Fig. 2 for ¯Γclust

ICD ).

In the other two sets of examples we put the Ca–He separation to 6 ˚A and arrange helium

in such ways to mimic solvated and surface locations of Ca. In one case Ca is surrounded by

He atoms to form a complex of the highest possible symmetry, in the other one Ca is placed

on top of the planar, symmetric HeN subcluster with a characteristic He-He separation of
3.2 ˚A. The following conclusions can be drawn from our calculations. Although Γclust

The above ﬁndings are of great help for estimating ¯Γdrop

ICD for large droplets since the num-

bers of ICD-active He atoms at each impurity–helium separation are the only quantities

which count. For the case of an axial symmetric 4He distribution exhibited in Ca@4HeN

can be estimated according to the expression given above for Ne@HeN . Whenever ρdop is
used we set the cutoﬀ radius R0 to 3.83 ˚A corresponding to the distance in the diatomic

CaHe at which ICD starts to operate. Although the actual R0 in droplets is likely to be

slightly diﬀerent from this value, there is no need to know it precisely because He atoms are
hardly present at such small separations from the impurity (ρdop ≈ 0.01ρbulk for r ∼ 4.5˚A

[25, 26], where ρbulk is the bulk liquid He density).

The estimated ¯Γdrop

ICD for both 3HeN and 4HeN droplets doped with Ca are shown in Fig. 3
(squares joined by blue and red lines, respectively). The curves exhibit diﬀerent behaviors
with droplet size. While ¯Γdrop
(τICD=1.7 ps) at N ∼ 800, ¯Γdrop

ICD in the former case approaches a saturation limit of 0.38 meV

ICD in the latter case has not saturated even at N = 5000.

Moreover, it shows a clear tendency towards further increase for larger droplets indicating

that the nearest surroundings of Ca (i.e. the dimple and its vicinity) is still under formation

there. One sees that the ICD width in doped He droplets has grown markedly compared

to that in CaHe. Although ICD has not become the dominant decay process in Ca@HeN

it has nevertheless become competitive with Auger decay due to the presence of the He

environment.

In summary, unambiguous evidence of the ability of He droplets to modify signiﬁcantly

the course of ionization processes occurring in systems embedded in them has been fur-

nished. It has been shown that the presence of a He environment enclosing Ne and Ca leads

to Interatomic Coulombic Decay of their inner-valence vacancies. Other suitable dopants

including atoms, molecules or clusters can undergo the same scenario as well. The pairwise

additivity of the ICD width established in small clusters has allowed us to estimate the

ICD widths in large droplets. The details of ICD depend noticeably on droplet size, droplet

density and the dopant position and hence also on the He isotope of which the droplet is

made. A comparison of the ICD performance with those of competitive relaxation mecha-

nisms in the doped He droplets has revealed that ICD dominates by orders of magnitude

8

over radiative decay and matches the performance of Auger decay if the latter is possible.

Note that ICD might have severe consequences for doped He droplets. The interaction of the

He environment with the slow electrons and ions produced due to ICD can lead to changes

of the structure or even to fragmentation of the droplets and are issues which merit further

theoretical and experimental studies.

We express our gratitude to M. Barranco and his co-workers for valuable discussions

and for providing us with the He density distributions for the pure and doped He droplets.

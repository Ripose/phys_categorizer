Charge Dependence of Temperature-Driven Phase Transitions of

Abstract

Phase transitions (liquid-solid, solid-solid) triggered by temperature changes are studied in free nanosized clusters
of T eF6 (SF6) with diﬀerent negative charges assigned to the ﬂuorine atoms. Molecular dynamics simulations at
constant energy show that the charge increase from qF =0.1e to qF =0.25e shifts the melting temperature towards
higher values and some of the metastable solid states disappear. The increased repulsive interaction maintains the
order in molecular systems at higher temperatures.

Key words: molecular dynamics, quenching, phase transition

1. Introduction

Small free clusters of atoms or molecules ex-
hibit solid-like or liquid-like properties that diﬀer
from the properties of their bulk counterpart. It
has been realized that the cluster structure (micro-
crystalline or amorphous) [1,2] depends on the pro-
duction method. Clusters made of AF6 molecules
(A = S, Se, T e, U, W ) have already been examined
in some detail by several groups [2–6] to establish
the existence of various structures and transforma-
tions between them. Some of the microcrystalline
states coexist dynamically [5,6] in a given tempera-
ture interval and those which are only locally stable
phases disappear when the cluster size increases as
was conﬁrmed both experimentally [1] and theoret-
ically [6]. Those states correspond to a partial order
of the molecular axes of symmetry. The system be-
comes completely orientationally ordered at very

low temperatures. The transition rate between the
ordered and disordered states can be retrieved from
the potential energy surface (PES) of the system,
[7]. It has been shown in [6] that clusters of the
same numbers of T eF6 or SF6 molecules exhibit
diﬀerent dynamics despite the same symmetry of
the molecules. The reason is that the topography
of PES in the case of SF6 clusters is shallower than
that of T eF6 clusters.

In the present study we explore the changes of
the cluster PES due to the changes of the charge
distribution in a single molecule. Our hypothesis is
that the molecular polarization is changed by us-
ing diﬀerent production methods. In order to ﬁnd
out the inﬂuence of the charge changes on orien-
tational order-disorder phase transitions we have
simulated the temperature behavior of molecular
clusters with the help of a constant energy molec-
ular dynamics.

2. Interaction Potential and Computational
Procedure

The main feature of the intermolecular interac-
tion is the dependence on the mutual orientations
of the molecules. There are experimental indica-
tions that AF6 molecules can be considered as rigid
octahedra to a reasonable extent. A small negative
charge should be assigned to the ﬂuorine atoms to
account for the chemical bond [3].

The intermolecular potential is presented as a
sum of atom-atom interaction (ﬂuorine-ﬂuorine,
tellurium-tellurium, ﬂuorine-tellurium) to account
for the orientational anisotropy:

where α, β denote either a ﬂuorine or a tellurium
(sulfur) atom; rαβ
is the distance between an α-
ij
atom in the i − th molecule and a β-atom in the
i − th molecule; n is the number of the molecules in
the cluster. The parameters σαβ and ǫαβ have been
ﬁtted to the experimental diﬀraction results, [2].

The Coulomb term accounts for the small nega-
tive charge qF assigned to the ﬂuorine atoms and
the positive charge carried by the central tellurium
atom, qte = 6 qF , which ensures a neutral molecule
at distances much larger than the molecular size.
Here we compare the temperature-driven transi-
tions for the case of qF = 0.1e and qF = 0.25e,
where e is the electron charge.

The charge qF has been computed using LCAO
(linear combinations of atomic orbitals) with pla-
nar basic functions (qF = 0.1e) and Gaussian basic
functions (qF = 0.25e).

The potential, Eq.1, has been used to solve the
classical equation of motion written in the Hamil-
tonian form with the help of a constant-energy MD
method. The velocity-Verlet [8] algorithm with a
time step of 5f s has been implemented. This is a

2

step optimized in [6] to satisfy the requirements for
long MD runs necessary to detect phase changes in
a computer experiment. The heating (cooling) of
the system is performed by velocity rescaling and
consequent thermalization [3].

3. Results and Conclusions

We have investigated the thermal behavior of
clusters consisting of 89 T eF6 (SF6) molecules in
the temperature interval (50 ÷ 140 K). The clus-
ters of T eF6 molecules melt above 125K (qF =
0.1e) and 130K (qF = 0.25e) as is seen from the
caloric curves in Fig.1, Fig.2 and the Lindemann
criterion, Fig.3. The Lindemann coeﬃcient δ <
0.08 corresponds to a solid-like phase (δ < 0.1 for
bulk systems) [11]. Melting is a discontinuous tran-
sition even in the case of nanosized clusters. The
heating and cooling of clusters (Fig.1) demonstrate
a hysteresis, which signals a discontinuous transi-
tion. The charge increase shifts the melting point
towards higher temperature: in comparison to a
cluster with less charged atoms, Fig.2. [ the larger
charge, the more robust is the cluster ].

The freezing point shifts towards lower temper-

atures.

The hysteresis area is larger for the case of
qF = 0.25e than for qF = 0.1e. One could specu-
late about a ”larger memory” in systems having a
”larger charge”. Another important distinction be-
tween less and more charged ﬂuorine atoms is the
structure adopted by the clusters below the freez-
ing point. The distributions N (cosθ) of the mutual
molecular orientations with qF = 0.1e, Fig.4, show
that they transform step by step from liquid to
a partially ordered solid (phase A) to an ordered
solid (phase B). The clusters with qF = 0.25e,
Fig.5, transform directly from liquid to an ordered
state. The radial distribution g(r) [10], Fig.6, is
a diagnostic of the lattice structure adopted by
clusters. We compute g(r) for the molecular center
of masses which is insensitive to the molecular ori-
entations. Fig.6 was obtained as follows: starting
from a low-temperature conﬁguration obtained
from simulations of a cluster with qF = 0.1e, we
change to qF = 0.25e and heat the cluster until it

melts. Then the cluster is cooled to a solid state.
g(r) are plotted at the same T = 110K on the
cooling and heating branch. The structures are ob-
viously diﬀerent. Typical conﬁgurations obtained
by quenching [9] of the MD trajectory are shown
in Fig.7 [(a) - for qF = 0.1e; (b) - for qF = 0.25e].
In both cases we obtain two orientations popu-
lated by the molecules but the arrangements of
”layers” in the clusters are diﬀerent.

We conclude that the charge change inﬂuences
both the melting temperature and structural
transformations. Meta-stable solid states with par-
tial order disappear for the case of larger charge.
The volume of the cluster decreases when the
charge increases and the cluster is more robust on
heating.

Our results show that the charge increase shifts
the transitions temperature towards higher val-
ues and some of the metastable states disappear.
This conﬁrms our understanding that the repul-
sive interaction maintains the order in molecular
systems.

Collisionless energy absorption in the short-pulse intense laser-cluster interaction

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

In this paper we present a more detailed account of the matter.

In a previous Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 123401 (2006)] we have shown by means of three-
dimensional particle-in-cell simulations and a simple rigid-sphere model that nonlinear resonance
absorption is the dominant collisionless absorption mechanism in the intense, short-pulse laser cluster

show that the absorption eﬃciency is almost independent of the laser polarization.
In the rigid-
sphere model, the absorbed energy increases by many orders of magnitude at a certain threshold
laser intensity. The particle-in-cell results display maximum fractional absorption around the same
intensity. We calculate the threshold intensity and show that it is underestimated by the common
over-barrier ionization estimate.

INTRODUCTION

Intense laser-matter interaction provides a route to
create energetic particles (e.g., electrons, ions, and pho-
tons) using table-top equipment. Clusters, possessing the
transparency of gas targets and the high charge density of
solid targets, proved to be very eﬃcient absorbers of laser
light. Their small size, compared to laser wavelength and
skin depth, avoids reﬂection of the laser beam at the clus-
ter surface as well as the loss of hot electrons into the cold
bulk. In fact, almost 100% absorption of the laser light
was reported in experiments with rare gas clusters [1].
Useful reviews on the subject are Refs. [2, 3, 4].

Upon irradiation of the rare gas clusters by intense
laser light, electrons ﬁrst absorb energy and leave their
“parent” ions. This is known as inner ionization, meaning
that the electrons are still bound to the cluster but not
necessarily to their “parent” ions. The total electric ﬁeld
(i.e., laser plus space charge ﬁeld) inside the cluster leads
to inner ionization up to high charge states not possible
with the laser ﬁeld alone (ionization ignition [5, 6]). As
the laser intensity during the pulse increases, these elec-
trons absorb energy from the laser ﬁeld and may leave
the cluster leading to the positive charging of the cluster
known as outer ionization. Thus outer ionization leads to
a non-neutral plasma. With the increasing outer ioniza-
tion, the restoring force of the ions counteracts ionization
ignition so that the latter stops at some point. The net
positive charge left behind ﬁnally explodes due to the
Coulomb repulsion and hydrodynamic pressure, leading
to the conversion of electron energy into ion energy. Typ-
ically MeV ions and keV electrons [7, 8, 9] are measured
in experiments.

It is clear from the described scenario that the un-
derstanding of the relevant mechanism(s) of laser energy
absorption leading to the heating of cluster electrons and
outer ionization is of great importance for the develop-
ment of a complete theoretical description.

Laser energy absorption by electrons proceeds either
through resonances (linear or nonlinear) or through non-
adiabaticities (all possible types of collisions). All of

these processes lead to dephasing of the current density
with respect to the laser ﬁeld, which, according to Poynt-
ing’s theorem, is a prerequisite for absorption. Collisional
absorption via collisions of electrons with ions are of mi-
nor importance at near infrared wavelengths
800 nm
or greater [10, 11, 12, 13] whereas it is the dominant
absorption mechanism at short wavelengths [13, 14, 15],
not studied in this paper. The ﬁnite size of the clusters
suggests that “collisions with the cluster boundary” may
be responsible for the energy absorption. However, this
viewpoint is misleading, as will be shown in Sec. II B.

During the expansion of the ionic core, the decreas-
ing charge density ρ(t) leads to the decrease of the Mie
plasma frequency, ωMie(t)
4πρ(t)/3 (atomic units
~ = m =

wise). For very short near infrared laser pulses ωMie(t)

unless the cluster has suﬃciently expanded (typically af-
ter a few hundred femtoseconds). Linear resonance (1),
well understood in theory, experiments, and simulations
[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], is thus ruled out for
very short pulses or during the early cycles of a long pulse
laser-cluster interaction where ion motion is negligible.
In this case, nonlinear resonance (NLR), whose origin
lies in the anharmonicity of the cluster potential, turns
out to be the dominant collisionless absorption mecha-
nism. In fact, for very short linearly polarized (LP) laser
pulses, it was clearly shown [25] that essentially all elec-
trons that contribute to outer ionization pass through the
NLR, which was unequivocally identiﬁed as the collision-
less absorption mechanism in the absence of linear res-
onance. The eigenfrequency ω[ˆr(t)] of a (laser-) driven
oscillator in an anharmonic potential, being dependent
on its excursion amplitude ˆr(t) (or the energy), may dy-
namically meet the NLR

ω[ˆr(t)] = ωl.

(2)

Due to the many body nature of the interaction, the
identiﬁcation, the separation, and the interpretation of

the absorption mechanisms in molecular dynamics or
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are often diﬃcult. Re-
cently, a method of identiﬁcation of the NLR in many-
body simulations of rare gas clusters has been proposed
[25]. The possible importance of NLR was also mentioned
or discussed previously [26, 27, 28, 29]. The rigid sphere
model (RSM) [27, 30, 31] where electrons and ions are
modeled by homogeneously charged rigid spheres oscillat-
ing against each other is clearly an oversimpliﬁcation of
a real many-particle system such as a cluster. However,
it proves useful for estimating the order of magnitude of
the absorbed energy as well as for the calculation of the
laser intensity where energy absorption is most eﬃcient,
as will be shown in the present work. Moreover, it pro-
vides physical understanding and clearly displays NLR
[25, 27].

The heating of cluster electrons in circularly polarized
laser ﬁelds has not yet received much attention, at least
theoretically. Experiments with rare-gas clusters show al-
most no eﬀect on the x-ray emission [32, 33, 34] and ion
energy distribution [35] when laser light of diﬀerent ellip-
ticity is used. Theoretically, circular polarization is par-
ticularly interesting because the above mentioned “colli-
sions with the cluster boundary” are strongly suppressed
in this case. Hence one may expect energy absorption
being less eﬃcient. NLR, on the other hand, occurs in
both cases, and, in fact, the energy absorption turns out
to be equally eﬃcient. Moreover, the absorbed energy
compares well with the RSM predictions.

The outline of the present paper is as follows:
in
Sec. II A we brieﬂy review the NLR and the RSM. In
Sec. II B the RSM is extended to circular polarization,
In Sec. II C the RSM
where NLR is observed as well.
threshold intensities are calculated. Section III is devoted
to the PIC [36] results for both linear and circular polar-
ization. Finally, we summarize our results in Sec. IV.

Throughout this paper we use n = 8-cycle laser pulses
of near infrared wavelength λ = 1056 nm and a ﬁxed clus-
ter radius R = 3.2 nm unless stated otherwise. NLR is
a robust phenomenon that—qualitatively—is insensitive
to cluster and laser parameters.

The ion motion can be neglected in the study of energy
absorption in very short laser pulses. Thus the ions just
form a static, positively charged background of spheri-
cal shape. For not too high laser intensity, the collective
motion of the electrons can also be approximated by a
homogeneous, rigid sphere of negative charge.
In the
simplest case the radii of ion and electron sphere are as-
sumed to be equal. In a more realistic model the electron
cloud expands [27]. However, the method of identiﬁca-
tion of the NLR used in this paper is independent of the
degree of electronic expansion. The center of mass of the
electron-ion system is, in good approximation, located

2

at the center of the ion sphere.
In an oscillating laser
ﬁeld, the homogeneously charged electron sphere oscil-
lates back and forth against the positively charged ion
sphere.

The ﬁrst term in the upper line of (4) is the linear force
when the displacement of the electron sphere is small,
the next two terms are the nonlinear terms which ap-
pear due to the partial overlap of the electron cloud
with the ion cloud. The term r−2 in the lower line of
(4) is the Coulomb force between the separated electron
sphere and ion sphere. The quantity on the right hand
side of (3) is the normalized driver strength, which is the
quiver amplitude El(τ )/ω2
l of a free electron in the laser
ﬁeld El(τ ) normalized to the cluster radius R. Earlier
work [27] showed that absorption of laser energy in the
RSM is characterized by a threshold driver strength be-
low which absorption is negligible (harmonic regime) and
above which absorption is almost constant. Figure 1
shows this threshold behavior for (ωMie/ωl)2 = 10/3 and
a n = 8-cycle sin2-pulse El(τ ) = E0 sin2(τ /2n) cos(τ ) for
0 < τ < 2nπ. The dashed line is the absorption corre-

absorbed energy obtained from the numerical solution of
(3). One sees that the absorbed energy jumps by many
orders of magnitude to a higher value after crossing a
threshold driver strength. The higher the cluster charge
density is, the higher is this threshold driver strength.
The rigid sphere model shows this behavior of eﬃcient
absorption above the threshold driver strength at all clus-
ter charge densities independent of the linear resonance
condition ρ = 3ρc, contrary to the nanoplasma model
[16]. Since the rigid sphere model does not necessarily re-
quires expansion of the cluster for the eﬃcient absorption
of laser energy, it permits us to understand the behavior
of energy absorption and the underlying mechanism for
very short laser pulses.

poral behavior of [ωeﬀ(τ )/ωl]2 above the threshold driver
strength for (ωMie/ωl)2 = 40/3. Since (ωMie/ωl)2 =
13.32, [ωeﬀ (τ )/ωl]2 starts at this value and drops with in-
creasing driver strength. It passes through unity at the
time indicated by the vertical line, and it is exactly at
that time where the electron sphere becomes free (outer
ionization). This incidence is clearly visible from the en-
ergy of the electron sphere, which passes through zero
and the excursion as well. Outer ionization and occur-
rence of NLR happens for all driver strengths above the
threshold whereas the resonance is never met below the
threshold. Since the amplitude of the excursion of the
electronic sphere depends upon the driver strength, the
excursion amplitude should also be large enough so that
the NLR is passed. The decrease in the eﬀective fre-
quency with the increase of the amplitude of excursion
of the electronic sphere in the force ﬁeld (3) can be un-
derstood by analyzing its motion in the corresponding
anharmonic potential

cursion ˆr < 1.5 and low charge densities (e.g., ρ/ρc < 10).
For higher charge densities more corrections [large num-
ber of k values in (11)] are needed, which are very much
cumbersome to calculate. Although (12) ﬁts well with the
numerical solution, ωeﬀ becomes negative when ˆr > 32/9.
However, the results using (12) agree with the exact ones

B. NLR in a circularly polarized laser ﬁeld

Clusters in a circularly polarized (CP) laser ﬁeld re-
ceived less attention in the literature. It is not known
a priori how the outer ionization and energy absorption
by clusters depend on the laser polarization.
In laser-
atom interaction the laser polarization has dramatic ef-
fects: since in CP the free electrons do not return to their
parent atom all the atomic eﬀects relying on rescatter-
ing such as high-order harmonic generation, high-order
above-threshold ionization, and nonsequential ionization
are strongly suppressed. In the context of clusters, the
study of the absorption eﬃciency as a function of the
laser polarization can help to discriminate among diﬀer-
ent absorption mechanisms. For instance, if laser en-
ergy absorption was indeed due to “collisions with the
cluster boundary” it would be suppressed in CP because
the electrons mainly swirl around parallel to the “clus-
ter boundary” rather than crossing (and hence colliding)
with it. However, as we will show, the absorption of laser
energy is largely independent of the laser polarization,
thus ruling out “collisions with the cluster boundary” as
a meaningful absorption mechanism.

1. Two-dimensional rigid sphere model

Let us ﬁrst extend the RSM to CP. In a CP laser ﬁeld
with electric ﬁeld components in x- and y-direction, the
equation of motion for the electronic sphere in the rigid
sphere approximation of a cluster can be written as

which has the same form as in the LP case (9). Earlier,
in Fig. 2, it was shown that NLR and outer ionization
in the RSM only occur when a threshold laser intensity
is crossed. The same is true for the occurrence of NLR
with CP light. Figure 4 shows the temporal behavior
of [ωeﬀ(τ )/ωl]2 above the threshold driver strength for a
n = 8-cycle CP laser pulse of wavelength λ = 1056 nm.
Here the cluster charge density is 40 times over-critical,

drops with increasing driver ﬁeld during the pulse. The
NLR [ωeﬀ(τ )/ωl]2 = 1 is passed at the time indicated by
the vertical line. As in the LP case in Fig. 2, the elec-
tron sphere is set free at the time the NLR is passed: the
energy of the electron sphere passes through zero, and
the excursion sharply increases to a high value. It is also
clear from Fig. 4, that once the electronic sphere is set
free, the frequency drops to zero, and the total absorbed
energy remains positive. A zero eﬀective frequency im-
plies an inﬁnite period, i.e, the electron sphere does not
return to the ion sphere. The main diﬀerence between
Fig. 4 and Fig. 2 is that in the case of the CP laser ﬁeld

5

the decrease of the eﬀective frequency is smooth (i.e.,
no oscillations) since the electric ﬁeld vector rotates but
its absolute value remains constant. As a consequence,
the electron sphere spirals out, staying away from the
potential center where ωeﬀ = ωMie. For LP instead, the
electron sphere is driven through the origin and hence the
eﬀective frequency undergoes oscillations before it drops
to the resonance value, as visible in Fig. 2. NLR is clearly
identiﬁed in both cases.

C. Prediction of threshold intensity for the NLR

NLR occurs above a threshold driver strength. Be-
yond this driver strength the rigid electron sphere gains
laser energy which is many order of magnitude higher
than below the threshold (see Fig. 1).
In an open po-
tential such as (10) the electron sphere is detached from
the ion sphere above the threshold driver strength, i.e.,
appreciable energy absorption and outer ionization occur
simultaneously. We would like to remark that in closed
potentials NLR occurs as well, as discussed in Ref. [28].
The threshold driver strength can be estimated. The

dimensionless potential U (r) = V (r)/(ω2

FIG. 5: NLR threshold intensities in the RSM vs the cluster

(3) with LP (lower solid), (13) CP (top solid), the vanishing
barrier approximation (VBA-LP, middle solid) (18), and the
VBA corrected for CP (upper dashed) are shown (see text

sities.

cycle pulse El(t) = E0 sin2(ωlt/2n) cos(ωlt) of wavelength

(13) laser light show that when the cluster charge density
is low, the NLR occurs almost at the same value of the
threshold intensity, irrespective of the polarization. As
the charge density increases the NLR threshold intensity
appears to be higher for CP than for LP. The VBA (18)
of the threshold intensity is in good agreement with the
numerical result for LP whereas the OBA (19) under-
estimates it. This fact might be related to the recently
observed “enhanced saturation intensities” in the ioniza-
tion of ﬁnite size systems such as C60 (see, e.g., [39, 40]
and references therein), indicating that the latter might
neither be a many-electron nor a quantum eﬀect but just
due to the ﬁnite size of the target.

The diﬀerence of the threshold intensities for LP and
CP is due to the deﬁnition of the CP ﬁeld (14), (15) where
a factor 2−1/2 has been introduced in order to render the
ponderomotive potential equal for LP and CP. However,
for the threshold intensity it is the electric ﬁeld (or the
intensity) that matters, not Up. For a given E0 the laser
intensity is I0 = E2
0 in the LP case but only I0/2 for CP.
Therefore, the upper black, dashed line in Fig. 5 shows
the VBA threshold intensity multiplied by a factor of two,
which is in good agreement with the numerical results for
the CP laser ﬁeld at higher charge densities.

So far we have studied the NLR absorption of laser
energy in a simpliﬁed model system assuming an anhar-
monic potential generated by the ions in which the ho-
mogeneous and rigid electron cloud moves.
In reality,
the potential builds up during the interaction with the
laser pulse because of ionization. The delicate interplay
of inner ionization, energy absorption by various mecha-
nisms, and outer ionization can be simulated using meth-
ods such as PIC or molecular dynamics. Previous work
[25], studying LP short laser pulses, showed that NLR

(2) can be clearly identiﬁed in such simulations as well.

III. NONLINEAR RESONANCE:
PARTICLE-IN-CELL RESULTS

In this Section we present results obtained from three-
dimensional PIC simulations. The cluster is exposed to
n = 8-cycle sin2-pulses El(t) = E0 sin2(ωlt/2n) cos(ωlt)
of near infrared wavelength λ = 1056 nm, i.e., the total
pulse duration is 28 fs. Since motion of ions does not
play an important role during the entire pulse the ions
are assumed ﬁxed, which ensures a well deﬁned, constant
Mie frequency ωMie. A PIC electron has the same charge
to mass ratio as a “real” electron, that is, e/m =
1
−
in atomic units. Each PIC electron moves under the in-
ﬂuence of the external laser ﬁeld and the space charge
ﬁeld Esc =
∇Φ(r, t) due to the potential Φ(r, t) that
is created by all charges (mapped to the numerical grid).
Hence the equation of motion of the i-th PIC electron is

−

¨ri + Esc(ri, t) =

El(t).

−

(20)

Equation (20) is solved self-consistently for all PIC elec-
trons. Clearly, Esc(ri, t) depends on the position of all
other particles
= i as well. The PIC simulation starts
with the neutral cluster conﬁguration so that Esc(ri, 0)
0.

A. Results for linear polarization

Figure 6 shows PIC results for the kinetic energy (KE)
and the total energy (TE) absorbed per electron in units
of Up, vs the peak laser intensity. One sees that the

6
absorbed energy per electron is on the order of Up. How-
ever, the absorbed energy is nonlinear in Up and dis-
plays a maximum before it drops because of the satu-
ration of outer ionization. The depletion is due to the
fact that at a given intensity most (if not all) electrons
are removed from the cluster (complete outer ionization).
Further inner ionization would be required to generate
“fresh” electrons that could continue to absorb energy.
The maxima in the PIC absorption curves are located
close to the threshold intensity predicted by the RSM.
The total absorbed energy around the maximum of the
PIC absorption curves (RSM as well) is on the order of
2Up = 5–6 keV which has been also reported in experi-
ments of intense laser clusters interactions [8].

In PIC simulations no sharp intensity threshold exists
since each PIC electron sees its own time-dependent ﬁeld
(space charge ﬁeld plus the laser ﬁeld). Therefore sharp
jumps (as seen in the RSM, e.g., Fig. 1) are absent.

×

Figure 7 compares the kinetic and potential energies
of a single PIC electron and the electronic sphere in the
RSM. The energies are plotted vs the excursion x/R
(along the direction of the laser ﬁeld). The peak laser
1016 W/cm2. We have checked
intensity is I0 = 2.5
that there are many PIC electrons that leave the cluster
similarly to the one presented in Fig. 7. The potential
and the kinetic energy gained by the electron sphere in
the RSM is divided by the total number of PIC elec-
trons so that a quantitative comparison is possible. The
main diﬀerence between PIC and RSM results is that in
the PIC simulation all the electrons see initially a zero
potential since the potential builds up from the neutral
cluster conﬁguration in the course of the interaction with
the laser ﬁeld while in the RSM the electronic sphere os-
cillates in a prescribed potential. Those PIC electrons
that stay long inside the cluster experience almost the
full ionic potential which then is similar to the RSM po-
tential.

As mentioned earlier, the absorption of energy by a
PIC electron depends upon the self-consistent potential
which develops during the laser pulse due to outer ion-
ization. As a result diﬀerent PIC electrons move along
diﬀerent trajectories, “see” a diﬀerent potential, and thus
are set free at diﬀerent times. Figure 8 shows a snapshot
of the collective potential Φ(r, t) at time ωlt/2π = 4.81
for a cut at z = 0 (and various y throughout the clus-
ter). The most lower curve represents the potential for
y = z = 0. The red circles represent the total energy
Etot,i = ˙r2
Φ(ri, t) of individual PIC electrons
located within the simulation box at that time.

One observes that many PIC electrons are accumulated
near the bottom-left of the potential well at this time.
These PIC electrons with Etot,i < 0 remain bound since
the laser ﬁeld amplitude is already decreasing from the
4th cycle onward. The kinetic and the total energy of
a PIC electron which leaves the potential well when its
excursion becomes x/R
2.88 at the same time is also
shown. This excursion approximately satisﬁes the NLR
condition ωeﬀ/ωl = 1 for the charge density ρ/ρc = 40,

The NLR behavior exhibited by the PIC electron in

Earlier we have mentioned that Esc(ri, t) depends on

tion starts with the charge neutral cluster conﬁguration
i.e., Esc(ri, 0)
0. Hence, a PIC electron “sees” ini-
tially an eﬀective frequency ωeﬀ,i(0) = 0. The laser ﬁeld
disturbs the charge equilibrium and ω2
eﬀ,i(t) becomes dif-
ferent from zero. ω2
eﬀ,i(t) may be even negative in regions
of accumulated electron density (repulsive potential). As
the cluster charges up, (ωeﬀ /ωl)2 quickly increases be-
yond unity (where the RSM starts in the ﬁrst place).
The start from ωeﬀ,i(0) = 0, the possibility of negative
ω2
eﬀ,i(t), and the three-dimensionality are the main diﬀer-
ences to the RSM analysis above. Figure 9 shows the ef-
fective frequency squared, the total energy Etot,i(t), and
the excursion ri/R vs time for the PIC electron whose
energy history is shown in Fig. 7. We deﬁne the time
when, for a particular electron, Etot,i becomes > 0 as the
ionization time of that electron. Data are plotted shortly
before the emission of this particle from the cluster po-
tential. It is clearly visible in Fig. 9 that the PIC electron
is escaped only when the resonance line (ωeﬀ /ωl)2 = 1 is
passed. Figure 9 can be well compared with Fig. 2 show-
ing ionization of the RSM via NLR.

In the case of PIC simulations the fulﬁllment of the
nonlinear resonance condition (ωeﬀ /ωl)2 = 1 is neces-
sary but not suﬃcient for ionization. As the potential
builds up, the PIC electrons transiently meet the NLR
condition, and, in fact, some electrons leave the cluster
at that early stage when the potential is still shallow and

the laser ﬁeld is relatively weak. However, as the poten-
tial deepens, PIC electrons “dropping” below the energy
necessary for NLR to occur, behave from then on simi-
lar to the RSM and may ﬁnally escape only by climbing
up in the potential and hitting the NLR (ωeﬀ/ωl)2 = 1.
During the 0.4 laser cycles plotted in Fig. 9 the (ωeﬀ /ωl)2-
curve displays artiﬁcial, short-time scale ﬂuctuations in-
herent in PIC simulations [36]. However, we checked that
macroscopic observables such as the absorbed energy or
the degree of outer ionization are well converged.

By following the dynamics of the electrons in the ef-

fective frequency vs energy-plane we identify the main
pathway to outer ionization and eﬃcient absorption. Fig-
ure 10a–h shows the scaled eﬀective frequencies squared
(ωeﬀ /ωl)2 of the individual PIC electrons vs their ener-
gies Etot(t) = ˙r2
Φ(ri, t) they would have if the
driver is switched oﬀ instantaneously at t = 1.5, 2, 2.5,
3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, and 5 laser cycles, respectively. At the
time when, for a particular electron, Etot becomes > 0
the ionization occurs for that electron. The laser inten-
1016 Wcm−2, and the pre-ionized cluster is
sity is 2.5
40 times over-critical so that (ωMie/ωl)2 = 40/3. As is
clearly visible in Fig. 10, each electron reaches positive
energy close to the point (ω2
l , Etot/Up) = (1, 0). The
radial position of each electron is color-coded, indicating
that outer ionization occurs at radii around 2R. During
the early time of the laser pulse (Fig. 10a,b) when many
electrons are still inside the cluster, (ωeﬀ /ωl)2 spreads
over a wide range, starting from the maximum value
(ωMie/ωl)2 down to negative values due to the repulsive
force exerted by the compressed electronic cloud. Note
that negative values in eﬀective frequency occur mainly
at early times where most of the electrons are still inside
the cluster. Electrons with positive but very small Etot
and ω2
0 represent low energetic electrons removed
earlier during the pulse (see Fig. 10a,b). The occurrence
of NLR is less clear for these early leaving electrons. As
mentioned above, these electrons move in a shallow ef-
fective potential with (ωeﬀ /ωl)2 < 1 when they leave the
cluster with ease and with rather low kinetic energy be-
cause the laser intensity is still low at the time of their
emission. Figures 10c–f show that most of the electrons
escape from the cluster by passing through the channel
(ω2
l , Etot/Up) = (1, 0) at radii around 2R. It is also
visible that more and more electrons are driven to pos-
itive frequency before they leave the cluster by passing
through (ω2
l , Etot/Up) = (1, 0). This is so because
as more and more electrons are freed, the remaining elec-
trons experience predominantly the force by the ionic
background, and they move deep into the potential (see
their negative values in energy) where they experience
the full Mie-frequency ωMie/ωl = 40/3.
In Fig. 10c,d,
the few electrons with positive energy but small radii
are those driven back to the cluster by the laser ﬁeld.
In Figures 10e,f, electrons are strongly aligned (no scat-
tered points) since the laser ﬁeld is approaching its max-
imum (at t = 4-cycles). After the peak of the laser pulse
(Figs 10g,h) the restoring force of the ions on almost all
electrons dominates the laser force.

we only point out the main diﬀerences. Equation (21)

the excursion ri/R. One can see that the PIC electron is
freed (i.e., its total energy becomes positive) only when
the resonance line (ωeﬀ /ωl)2 = 1 is passed.

Figure 12 is the CP analogue of Fig. 10. The results
are very much similar to the LP case shown in Fig. 10
and the arguments made there apply here as well. NLR
is clearly observed. The main diﬀerence is that the PIC
electrons are nicer aligned towards the resonance point,
even at early times during the laser pulse (see Fig. 12 b,
c, d). Almost no scattered particles are visible because
the dynamics mainly consist of swirling around the clus-
ter center rather than oscillating through it. The number
of electrons returning to the cluster is much less so that
the recombination and rescattering probability is smaller
in the case of CP. The same is observed in laser-atom in-
teraction experiments, with important consequences for
harmonic generation and non-sequential ionization.

For suﬃciently high charge density, the degree of outer
ionization (deﬁned as the ratio of removed electrons to
the total number of electrons) is less compared to the
case of LP laser pulses. The explanation is the same as
in Sec.II C: the eﬀective laser intensity for CP is by a
factor of two lower than for LP because of our deﬁnition
of the CP ﬁeld (14), (15).

One may object that, since the denominator in (21)
necessarily increases while the numerator decreases for
an electron on its way out of the cluster potential, that
the passage through a point (ω2
l , Etot/Up) = (x, 0)
with x some value < (ωMie/ωl)2 is rather the consequence
of outer ionization than the mechanism behind it. How-
ever, NLR only occurs at x = 1, and the results in Fig. 10
and Fig. 12 show only little spreading along (ωeﬀ/ωl)2 at
Etot = 0. Moreover, the fact that both the single electron
energies become positive and the radii exceed
2R when
(ωeﬀ/ωl)2 = 1 indicates that NLR is indeed the responsi-

log-log representation up to a certain intensity and then
tends to saturate due to the saturation of outer ioniza-
tion. One sees that the saturation in the PIC results
occur close to the RSM threshold intensity. Since with
increasing charge density the restoring force due to the
ions increases, the saturation of energy absorption in the
RSM and PIC occur at higher laser intensities as the den-

sity increases from ρ/ρc = 3 to ρ/ρc = 40 in Fig. 13a–d.
When outer ionization and the energy absorption sat-
urate with increasing peak laser intensity, the average
absorbed energy per electron divided by Up (which is
proportional to the so-called fractional absorption) starts
decreasing in Figs. 13e–f. Figures 13a,e show that at lin-
ear resonance ρ/ρc = 3, the absorbed energy is already
high at low values of the laser intensity (< 1012 Wcm−2),
and absorption is very eﬃcient as compared to higher
charge densities ρ/ρc = 5–40, presented in Figs. 13b–d
and Figs. 13f–h. In fact, Fig. 13e illustrates that the ab-
100Up (both in the
sorbed energy is on the order of
RSM and in the PIC) before the saturation of outer ion-
ization. However, one should bear in mind that at too
low laser intensities inner ionization would not occur in
the ﬁrst place so that in reality there would be no ab-
sorption at all.

∼

Energy absorption in CP and LP laser ﬁelds at all in-
tensities and all charge densities are almost equally eﬃ-
cient. Recalling that with our deﬁnition of the CP laser
ﬁeld the ponderomotive potential is equal for LP and
CP while the electric ﬁeld amplitude is not, we conclude
that for the absorbed energy Up matters while the NLR
threshold is determined by the ﬁeld strength.

The discrepancy between the PIC and RSM results at
lower intensities is, again, due to the fact that the RSM
provides a very well deﬁned potential, although a more
and more shallow one as the density decreases, in which

is initially zero and builds up in the course of outer ion-
ization. At higher intensities, the potentials for the re-
maining PIC electrons are closer to the RSM potential
(see Fig. 7), explaining the improving agreement between
RSM and PIC results as the laser intensity increases.

IV. SUMMARY

In summary, two diﬀerent approaches to study colli-
sionless laser energy absorption by clusters, namely (i)
the rigid sphere model and (ii) particle-in-cell simula-
tions, were pursued in this work. The goal was to iden-
tify the dominant mechanism of energy absorption and
outer ionization of the cluster electrons in near infrared,

11

short laser pulses where collisional absorption is known
to be ineﬃcient. We showed that the cluster electrons
contributing to eﬃcient absorption and outer ionization
undergo nonlinear resonance, meaning that the instanta-
neous frequency of their motion in a time-dependent, an-
harmonic, eﬀective potential transiently meets the laser
frequency. Nonlinear resonance is the only possible ab-
sorption mechanism if the laser pulse is too short for
the linear resonance to occur (or during the early cluster
dynamics in longer pulses) and if electron-ion collisions
(inverse bremsstrahlung) are negligible. In order to prove
the occurrence of nonlinear resonance we used a method
to analyze the results obtained from particle-in-cell sim-
ulations, namely the mapping of the system of electrons
and ions that interact through their mean ﬁeld onto a
system of nonlinear oscillators.

The occurrence of nonlinear resonance in the particle-
in-cell simulations presented in this paper resembles the
nonlinear resonance in the rigid sphere model. For a
given cluster charge density, there is a threshold inten-
sity around which the average electron energy displays a
maximum conversion of laser energy. The threshold in-
tensity can be calculated using the newly introduced van-
ishing barrier approximation. The common over-barrier
approximation—applicable to atoms—fails in the case
of ﬁnite-size potentials and underestimates the required
laser ﬁeld strength for ionization. This fact might be
related to the experimentally observed “enhanced satu-
ration intensity” in the ionization of ﬁnite-size systems
such as C60.

The eﬃciency of energy absorption from the laser is
almost the same for linear and circular polarization, in-
dicating that “collisions with the cluster boundary” as an
explanation are misleading. Instead, nonlinear resonance
is the main absorption mechanism in both cases. To il-
lustrate this, the rigid sphere model has been extended
for the circularly polarized laser pulses in this paper.

Future work will take self-consistent charge state distri-
butions and mobile ions into account. Preliminary results
indicate that nonlinear resonance clearly persists under
these circumstances as well.

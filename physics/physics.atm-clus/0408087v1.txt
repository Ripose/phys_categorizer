Abstract

In this paper we employ the hydrodynamic formulation of time-dependent density functional

theory to obtain the van der Waal coeﬃcients C6 and C8 of alkali-metal clusters of various sizes

including very large clusters. Such calculation becomes computationally very demanding in the

orbital-based Kohn-Sham formalism, but quite simple in the hydrodynamic approach. We show

that for interactions between the clusters of same sizes, C6 and C8 sale as the sixth and the eighth

power of the cluster radius rsepectively, and approach the respective classically predicted values

for the large size clusters.

INTRODUCTION

The long-range van der Waals forces play an important role in the description of many

physical and chemical phenomena such as adhesion, surface tension, physical adsorption, etc.

The correlations between electron density ﬂuctuations at widely separated locations give

rise to these long range forces. For clusters the knowledge of coeﬃcients of van der Waals

interaction is useful in describing the cluster-cluster collisions and also for characterizing the

orientation of clusters in bulk matter. The van der Waals interaction coeﬃcients, namely

C AB
6

and C AB

8

between small alkali metal particles within the spherical jellium background

(SJBM) model of have been theoretically calculated in the past [1, 2, 3] using time dependent

density functional theory (TDDFT) [4]. In Refs. [1, 2] time-dependent Kohn-Sham (TDKS)

[4] formalism of TDDFT was employed to obtain C AB

and C AB

8

6

. On the other hand, in Ref.

[3], we employed density based method within TDDFT formalism to obtain the van der

Waals coeﬃcient C AB

6

for the clusters. The TDKS formalism is an orbital based theory and

involves calculation of these orbitals in a self-consistent manner. Thus, as the size of system

increases these calculations tend to become computationally cumbersome.

In such cases,

our approach [3] is much easier to as it makes calculations size independent with hardly any

loss in accuracy.

The main aim of this paper is to extend our previous study [3, 5, 6] by applying the density

based hydrodynamic approach to calculate the higher-order van der Waals coeﬃcient C AB

8

of alkali atom clusters characterizing dipole-quadrupole interaction of long-range force and

study its evolution with the size of clusters. In addition to this we also calculate C AB

and

6

C AB
8

coeﬃcients for the pair interaction between potassium clusters of various sizes and

between potassium and sodium clusters of diﬀerent sizes as well.

Before proceeding further, it is necessary to note that the density functional theory (DFT)

in principle should give the exact ground-state properties including long range van der Waals

energies. However, the frequently used local density approximation (LDA) [7, 8] and gen-

eralized gradient approximations (GGA) [9, 10, 11] fail to reproduce the van der Waals

energies. This is due to the fact that LDA and GGA cannot completely simulate the corre-

lated motion of electrons arising from coulomb interaction between distant non overlapping

electronic systems. It is only recently that several attempts [12, 13, 14] have been made to

obtain van der Waals energies directly from the ground-state energy functional by correcting

2

the long range nature of the eﬀective Kohn-Sham potential. On the other hand, it is possi-

ble to make reliable estimates of the van der Waals coeﬃcients by using expressions which

relate these coeﬃcients to the frequency dependent multipole polarizabilities at imaginary

frequencies [15, 16]. We follow this route for the calculation of these coeﬃcients.

The paper is organized as follows:

In section II we express C6 and C8 in terms the

dipole and the quadrupole dynamic polarizabilities. We then brieﬂy describe our method

of obtaining these polarizabilities employing hydrodynamic approach of TDDFT. Results of

our calculations are presented and discussed in section III.

II. METHODS OF CALCULATION

The nonretarded electrostatic interaction energy between two spherically symmetric elec-
tronic systems A and B separaterd by interaction distance R can be written as [15, 16]

distributions corresponding to the two systems do not overlap. The coeﬃcient C AB

describes

6

the dipole-dipole interaction, and C AB
corresponds to the dipole-quadrupole interaction
between system A and B . These coeﬃcients can be expressed in terms of the dynamic

8

multipole polarizability αl(ω) (where l denotes the index of multipolarity) by following

relations [17, 18]:

C AB

6 = C(A, 1; B, 1)

l (iω) is better behaved than its real frequency counterpart α(ω): it does

. Consequently, the quadrature in Eq. (3) can be computed quite accurately. To

determine the frequency dependent polarizabilities appearing in Eq.(3), we employ variation-

perturbation method within the hydrodynamic approach of TDDFT. We now describe the

theory in brief. For details the reader is referred to the literature [3, 5, 6]

The basic dynamical variables of the hydrodynamic theory are the time dependent density

ρ(r, t) and the velocity potential S(r, t). Thus the total time-averaged energy can be ex-

pressed in terms of these two variables. For our purpose we need to evaluate the second-order

change in the time-averaged energy as this is directly related to the frequency dependent

multipole polarizability by the relation

αl(ω) =

The second-order time-averaged energy E(2)

in turn can be expressed as

It is easily shown [3] that E(2)

is

stationary with respect to the variations in the ﬁrst-order induced density ρ(1)(r, t) and
the induced current-density S(1)(r, t). Consequently, E(2)

(6)

where Ts[ρ], EH [ρ] and EXC[ρ] denote the kinetic, Hartree and the exchange-correlation

(XC) energy functionals respectively. The exact forms of Ts[ρ] and EXC[ρ] are not known.

Consequently to perform any calculation one needs to use approximate forms for these

functionals. On the other hand, the hartree energy functional EH[ρ] representing classical

coulomb energy is exactly known and it given by

At this point it is important to point out that the VP method discussed above is also

applicable for the imaginary frequencies with ω2 replaced by

ω2 in Eq. (11) [3]. This allows

us to determine dynamic multipolarizability at imaginary frequencies (α(iω)) by exactly the

same procedure as employed for getting α(ω). All that is required for this is to change ω2

to

ω2 in Eq. (11). This is done very easily in the numerical code written for determining

−

dynamic polarizability at real frequencies.

As mentioned earlier the calculation of E(2)

l

requires approximating the functionals Ts[ρ]

and EXC[ρ]. To this end we choose the von Weizsacker [19] form for Ts[ρ] which is given as

Our previous experience with the calculation of response properties has led us to choose von

Weizsacker KE functional for the polarizability calculation. For the XC energy, adiabatic

local-density approximation (ALDA) [4] is accurate enough to describe the energy changes.

and for the correlation energy functional we employ the Gunnarsson-Lundqvist (GL) [21]

parametrized form for it .

In the present paper the ground-state densities ρ(0)(r) of clusters are obtained by em-

ploying purely density-based extended Thomas-Fermi (ETF) [22, 23] method within the

spherical jellium background model (SJBM) of metal clusters. This approach yields the

ground-state densities of very large clusters (containing up to 1000 atoms) easily thereby

allowing us to study the evolution of van der Waals coeﬃcients with the size of clusters.

For details of the ETF method and its application to study alkali-metal cluster, we refer the

reader to [5, 6, 22, 23, 24]. In the next section we present the results for C AB

and C AB

8

of

6

alkali metal clusters by employing the method describe above.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We have performed calculations for the coeﬃcients C AB

and C AB

8

6

between clusters of

alkali metal atoms of various sizes. In this paper we consider clusters made up of sodium

(rs = 4.0a.u.) and potassium (rs = 4.86a.u.) atoms ( where rs is the Wigner-Seitz radius of

the cluster species). First we discuss the results for the sodium clusters. For completeness

we also include C AB

6

numbers of sodium clusters in this paper. As in our previous study,

Table I and II we present the results for C AB

and C AB

8

6

respectively, between sodium clusters

containing 2, 8, 20, and 40 atoms. For comparison we also show the corresponding TDKS

results of Ref. [2] in parenthesis. Table I and II clearly show that the numbers obtained by

employing the hydrodynamic approach for small clusters are quite close to the corresponding

numbers obtained by the TDKS method. The numbers for C AB

obtained in this paper are

6

systematically lower than the orbital-based TDKS results. The diﬀerence between the two

results is slightly more for larger clusters than the smaller ones, the maximum diﬀerence

being of the order of 10%. Now we discuss the main results of this paper, that is, numbers

for C AB

8

between clusters of sodium clusters.

6

In Table II we present the results for the coeﬃcient C AB

. This table clearly shows that our

8

are quite close to the corresponding TDKS results. In comparison to the

numbers for C AB

8
results for C AB

unlike C AB

6

our numbers for C AB

6
case, the numbers for C AB

8

8

are closer to the corresponding TDKS values. Moreover,

are not always lower than the corresponding TDKS

results. The values of C AB

8

between 2 and 2 and, 2 and 8 atom sodium clusters obtained by

the hydrodynamic method are slightly more than the corresponding TDKS results. We next

apply hydrodynamic approach to calculate the van der Waals coeﬃcients between potassium

clusters of various sizes.

In Table III and IV we present the results for C AB

and C AB

8

6

respectively, between potas-

sium clusters of diﬀerent sizes. Again two tables clearly show that both C AB

and C AB

8

6

between potassium clusters are obtained quite accurately with the hydrodynamic approach.

The numbers obtained by us for potassium clusters are all lower than the corresponding

TDKS results. Table III and IV also clearly show that the diﬀerence between the hydro-

dynamic and the TDKS results is lower for the larger clusters than than the smaller ones.

On the other hand, for sodium clusters the diﬀerence between the two results shows the

opposite trend.

Next we now present in Table V and VI the results for C AB

and C AB

8

6

respectively, for

the pair interaction between sodium and potassium clusters with 2, 8, and, 20 constituent

atoms. Once again we see from these two table that hydrodynamic numbers quite close to

the corresponding TDKS results barring few exceptions like the number for C AB

between

6

two types of clusters containing 8 atoms each. Table V and VI also show that like the pair

interaction between clusters of identical atoms the value of C AB

for two diﬀerent clusters

8

obtained by hydrodynamic approach is closer to the TDKS as compared to the corresponding

C AB
6

results.

With favourable comparison between the numbers obtained by our approach and those

by the TDKS approach for small clusters we now employ the hydrodynamic approach to

evaluate the van der Waal coeﬃcients for much larger clusters. This allows us to study the

size dependence of van der Waals coeﬃcients and how they approach the asymptotic classical

values. In the present paper we have performed calculations for clusters containing up to

1000 atoms without any increase in computational eﬀort. To study the size dependence of

van der Waals coeﬃcients we plot in Figs. 1 and 2, C AB

0 respectively, as
functions of R0 ( where R0 = rsN 1/3 and N denotes number of atoms). These two ﬁgures

0 and C AB

6 /R6

8 /R8

7

clearly exhibit that as the size of cluster increases the values of coeﬃcients C AA

C AA

8 /R8

0 saturate to constants numbers, indicating that C AA

6

and C AA

8

6 /R6

0 and
scale as the sixth and

the eight power of the radius R0 of the cluster respectively. This trend is consistent with the

fact that the properties of metal clusters approach their corresponding classical values as

the size of cluster is increased. The classical expressions for C AA

6 /R6

0 and C AA

8 /R8

0 between

clusters of same sizes can be written as [2]

Here ωM ie is the Mie resonance frequency given by

and it is equal to 1/√3 bulk plasmon frequency. The classical expressions for C AA

6 /R6

0 and

C AA

8 /R8

0 given above are derived in Ref. [2] by assuming that all the strength of respective

multipole resonance is concentrated in a single peak. By substituting the values of rs in

Eq. (14) we get following numbers for sodium clusters C AA
8 /R8

whereas for potassium clusters C AA
0 and C AA

0 = 0.37. These classical numbers
0 are shown by asymptotic straight lines in Figs. 1 and 2. We see

0 = 0.07 and C AA

0 = 0.094 and C AA

0 = 0.49

for C AA

8 /R8

6 /R6

8 /R8

6 /R6

6 /R6

from Figs. 1 and 2 that the hydrodynamic approach yields correct asymptotic values of the

van der Waals coeﬃcients or the values to which these coeﬃcient saturate as the size of

cluster grows.

To conclude, we have extended the applicability of the hydrodynamic approach within

TDDFT to the calculation of higher order van der Waals coeﬃcient C AB

between clusters

of various sizes and diﬀerent species. Our results for both C AB

are quite close to

8
and C AB

8

6

more accurate orbital based TDKS approach. In particular we have found that the numbers

obtained by hydrodynamic approach for C AB

are more accurate than that of C AB

. For both

8

6

sodium and potassium clusters we have been able to calculate C AB

and C AB

8

6

coeﬃcients for

clusters containing up to 1000 atoms. Thus we have been able to get the evolution of these

coeﬃcients as a function of cluster size and have shown that they approach their respective

classical values for large clusters.

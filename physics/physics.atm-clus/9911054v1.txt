Positronium-Hydrogen-Atom Scattering in a Five-State Model

The scattering of ortho-positronium (Ps) by hydrogen atoms has been investigated in a ﬁve-state
coupled-channel model allowing for Ps(1s)H(2s,2p) and Ps(2s,2p)H(1s) excitations using a recently
proposed electron-exchange model potential. The higher (n ≥ 3) excitations and ionization of the
Ps atom are calculated using the ﬁrst Born approximation. Calculations are reported of scattering
lengths, phase shifts, elastic, Ps- and H-excitation, and total cross sections. Remarkable correlations
are observed between the S-wave Ps-H binding energy and the singlet scattering length, eﬀective
range, and resonance energy obtained in various model calculations. These correlations suggest that
if a Ps-H dynamical model yields the correct result for one of these four observables, it is expected
to lead to the correct result for the other three. The present model, which is constructed so as to
reproduce the Ps-H resonance at 4.01 eV, automatically yields a Ps-H bound state at −1.05 eV
which compares well with the accurate value of −1.067 eV. The model leads to a singlet scattering
length of 3.72a0 and eﬀective range of 1.67a0, whereas the correlations suggest the precise values of
3.50a0 and 1.65a0 for these observables, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently, there have been several experimental and
theoretical investigations of ortho positronium (Ps) atom
scattering from diﬀerent neutral atomic and molecular
targets. Experiments have primarily measured total Ps-
atom scattering cross sections from various targets [1–3].
In addition to total cross sections, the theoretical stud-
ies have also predicted partial cross sections and phase
shifts for Ps-H [4–9], Ps-He [8,10–12], and Ps-H2 [13,14]
systems. Ps scattering by neutral targets is of special in-
terest, as the direct amplitudes for elastic and even-parity
state transitions are zero [15] due to the internal charge
and mass symmetry of Ps. Hence the electron-exchange
interaction is the dominating factor at low energies in any
Ps-impact scattering with neutral targets apart from the
eﬀect of polarization and van der Waals forces [10,16].
Ps scattering makes it possible to study the eﬀect of
exchange in an environment characteristically diﬀerent
from that of the electron-atom systems [15]. Among all
Ps-atom systems, the positronium-hydrogen (Ps-H) sys-
tem is the simplest and is of fundamental interest. The
Ps-H scattering has most of the complications of a many-
body problem, but few-body techniques can be employed
for its solution.

−

A general feature of the measured total cross section
in Ref. [1] for Ps scattered by He, Ar, and H2, is a peak
near 20
25 eV and a decreasing trend below this en-
ergy. Recent measurements near 1 eV [2] are consistent
with this trend. However, because of the large error bars
on the measurement in Ref. [1] at the lowest energy (10
eV) and due to inadequate data in this energy region,
it is not clear from experiment whether the total cross
section has a minimum near the Ps excitation thresh-
old or not. The recent three-Ps-state studies of Refs.
[9,12,14] suggest the existence of a minimum near the

Ps(2s) threshold. This feature of the cross section is able
to reconcile the two diﬀerent experimental ﬁndings and is
also noticed in the unpublished theoretical work of Peach
[17]. The R-matrix calculation [7,8] for H and He, in
which 22 coupled pseudo states are included, does not
show this trend; whereas the static-exchange (one-state)
cross sections [10] for He are too large to match the mea-
surement near the Ps(2s) threshold [12]. In this respect,
the model-potential studies of Refs. [9,12,14] are unique
in reproducing the experimental trend of Ps-impact scat-
tering by H, He, and H2. Unphysically large low-energy
cross sections of previous cross sections are expected to
be a consequence of the nonorthogonality arising from
antisymmetrization and the very reactive nature of Ps
scattering [9,12,14].

In this paper we present a theoretical study of ortho-
Ps-H scattering employing a ﬁve-state model allow-
ing for excitation of both Ps and H atoms using the
model exchange potential mentioned above. The follow-
ing states are included in the calculation: Ps(1s)H(1s),
Ps(2s)H(1s), Ps(2p)H(1s), Ps(1s)H(2s), and Ps(1s)H(2p)
and such a model should be considered adequate at low
energies. The cross sections for higher discrete and con-
tinuum excitations of the Ps atom are calculated in the
framework of Born approximation. These Born cross sec-
tions are added to the above ﬁve-state cross sections to
predict the total cross section.

Although, the parametrization of the model exchange
potential of Ref. [12], which is obtained using a physical
argument, is satisfactory, it is not unique and leaves an
option for the parameters to be varied to tune to some
precise data at low energies. In the absence of experimen-
tal Ps-H cross sections we tune this parameter to repro-
duce the energy of the singlet S-wave resonance. Ho has
provided the most precise estimate of S-wave resonance
energy, which is 4.01 eV (width 0.075 eV) [18]. Frolov

1

and Smith have made the most accurate estimate of the
S-wave bound state, which is 1.067 eV [19]. We varied the
parameter of our model to ﬁt the Ps-H resonance energy
at 4.01 eV and found that the same model without any
further adjustment also produced a Ps-H bound state at
1.05 eV. No previous scattering model has been able to
−
produce these two features of the Ps-H system simulta-
neously and so precisely. Similar to those obtained in the
three-nucleon system [20,21], we ﬁnd remarkable corre-
lation between the S-wave Ps-H binding energy and the
singlet scattering length, eﬀective range, and resonance
energy obtained in various model calculations. These
correlations suggest that if a model yields the correct re-
sult for one of these observables it should also yield the
correct result for the other three. The present model
leads to reasonably accurate energies for the Ps-H bound
state and resonance and because of the above correlation
the singlet scattering length and eﬀective range are also
expected to be fairly accurate.

We describe the calculational scheme, model exchange
potential and numerical results in Sec. II and a summary
of our ﬁndings in Sec. III.

In our latest calculations [12] we ﬁnd that the sym-
metric form provides better results and therefore here
we present results of Ps-H scattering using a ﬁve-state
model and Eqs.
(2.5) and (2.7) that includes the fol-
lowing states: Ps(1s)H(1s), Ps(2s)H(1s), Ps(2p)H(1s),
Ps(1s)H(2s), and Ps(1s)H(2p). The truncated model
that includes the ﬁrst three of these states will be referred
to as the three-Ps-state, or simply, the three-state, model,
and the three-H-state model includes the ﬁrst, fourth and
ﬁfth of this set. The model that includes the ﬁrst n states
of this set will be termed the n-state model. The Born
terms for the simultaneous excitation of both H and Ps
atoms are found to be small and will not be considered

here in the coupled-channel scheme. Higher excitations
and ionization of Ps are conveniently treated in the Born
approximation including exchange and higher excitations
and ionization of H are excluded. We calculate the elastic
Ps(1s)H(1s) cross section and inelastic excitation cross
sections to Ps(2s)H(1s), Ps(2p)H(1s), Ps(1s)H(2s), and
Ps(1s)H(2p) states. We also calculate cross sections for
the discrete excitation of the 3s, 3p, 3d, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5p,
5d, 5f, 6p states and also for ionization of Ps in the ﬁrst
Born approximation, keeping the target frozen to its ini-
tial ground state using exchange given by Eqs. (2.5) and
(2.7).

In previous studies we found that the exact values of
the parameters α and β in Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7) lead to
good results for cross sections. However, these parame-
ters in Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7) correspond to some average
value of momentum [12] and it was noted that one could
conveniently allow these parameters to vary in order to
improve the ﬁt with experiment. As there are no exper-
iments in Ps-H scattering, we choose these parameters
to ﬁt the known S-wave singlet resonance at 4.01 eV in

3

the Ps-H system [18]. The resonance is found in the two-
state model with Ps(1s)H(1s) and Ps(2s)H(1s) states. It
continues to exist as more states are included in the dy-
namical equation. However, its energy reduces a little
(by up to about 0.05 eV) as more and more states are
added. The position of the resonance in the ﬁve-state
and two-state models with the exact parameters α’s and
(2.7) is 4.72 eV and 4.76 eV, respectively.
β’s in Eq.
We ﬁnd that the Ps-H resonace energy decreases and the
binding energy increases monotonically, as the values of
the parameters α’s and β’s are reduced in Eq. (2.7). For
a systematic reduction we used in place of Eq. (2.7) the
following form:

D = (k2

i + k2

f )/8 + C2[(α2

µ + α2

µ′ )/2 + (β2

good low-energy phase shifts. This correlation explicit in
the eﬀective-range expansion is a consequence of the dy-
namics of the problem. The dominance of the short-range
part of the interaction is responsible for the appearance of
correlation between low-energy observables in a system
[20]. In the trinucleon system in the attractive S-wave
doublet channel all low-energy observables were found to
be correlated with binding energy in diﬀerent model cal-
culations [20,21], which implies if a model yields the cor-
rect result for one of the low-energy observables it should
also yield the correct result for the others. Such correla-
tions were used to predict diﬀerent low-energy trinucleon
observables from results of diﬀerent model calculations.
These predictions were later conﬁrmed in other rigorous
calculations and experiments [21].

where C is an arbitrary factor. In order to obtain the
S-wave resonance at 4.01 eV in the ﬁve-state model we
need C = 0.784, which is the most accurate estimate of
Interestingly enough, with this value
this energy [18].
of C, the ﬁve-state model produces a Ps-H bound state
1.05 eV, which is consistent with both the accurate
at
1.067 eV [19] and experimental
theoretical estimate of
0.2 eV [23]. The binding energy is cal-
result of
culated by extrapolating the calculated k cot δ values at
positive energies to negative energies using the following
1/a+r0k2/2+Bk4,
eﬀective-range expansion: k cot δ =
−
and ﬁnding the solution of k cot δ
ik = 0 at the bound
state, where δ is the S-wave phase shift, a the scatter-
ing length, r0 the eﬀective range, k the momentum, and
B the coeﬃcient of the k4 term. In all calculations pre-
sented in this work we use the value of C = 0.784 in Eqs.
(2.8) and (2.5). The simultaneous accurate reproduction
of both the binding and resonance energies assures the
reliability of our model.

The elastic scattering S-wave phase shifts for diﬀerent
partial waves for singlet and triplet states below the low-
est excitation threshold are shown in Fig. 1. We compare
the S-wave phase shifts with the static-exchange phase
shift of Hara and Fraser [5] and the three-state close-
coupling approximation (CCA) phase shifts of Sinha et
al. [10]. We also show our static-exchange phase shifts.
The phase shifts of Hara and Fraser are identical with
the static exchange results of Ref. [10]. The phase shifts
of Sinha et al. and of Hara and Fraser suggests that the
trend of convergence of the S-wave phase shifts of Ref.
[10] is in the direction of the present phase shifts.

Because of the existence of a low-energy eﬀective-range
expansion, the binding energy of a weakly bound singlet
Ps-H state should be correlated with the S-wave singlet
scattering length in diﬀerent model calculations. This
is shown in Fig. 2 where we plot the singlet scatter-
ing length versus binding energy for several calculations.
The straight-line correlation between these two observ-
ables for various model calculations implies that a model
that produces the correct energy of the Ps-H bound state,
should also produce the correct scattering length and

Correlation is also possible among other low-energy S-
wave singlet Ps-H observables which are not obviously re-
lated. For example, we ﬁnd a correlation between S-wave
singlet Ps-H binding energy and eﬀective range, which is
shown in Fig. 3.
In this ﬁgure we plot the eﬀective
ranges of Refs. [4,7] and their respective binding ener-
gies together with the ﬁve-state result. We also observe
a correlation between S-wave singlet Ps-H binding and
resonance energies, which is shown in Fig. 4. The essen-
tially exact resonance and binding energies [18,19] lie on
the line in Fig. 4 obtained by our calculation and those of
Refs. [4,7]. The reproduction of the correct value of the
singlet Ps-H eﬀective range and resonance energy in ad-
dition to the scattering length assures proper variation
of the phase shift in our model. The previous calcula-
tions [4–7] have possibly not converged well as they do
not produce the correct energies of Ps-H bound state and
resonance. The ﬁve-state model reproduces the positions
of the Ps-H bound state and resonance fairly accurately,

and so it is expected that the present singlet scattering
length, 3.72a0, eﬀective range, 1.67a0, phase shifts and
low-energy cross sections are more close to the converged
results than those of previous calculations. The correla-
tions of Fig. 2 and 3 suggest that the correct singlet scat-
tering length and eﬀective range, corresponding to the
accurate Ps-H binding energy of 1.067 eV [19], should be
3.5a0 and 1.65a0, respectively, in close agreement with
our model calculation.
In the triplet case there is no
bound state and no interesting correlation is observed.

To illustrate the trend of convergence of our calcula-
tion, we show in Table I the results for singlet scatter-
ing length, eﬀective range, and binding energies for one-,
three-, and ﬁve-state schemes with model exchange po-
tential and compare with the conventional R-matrix cal-
culation of Ref. [7] for diﬀerent number of coupled states.
In this table we also show the predictions for the scatter-
ing length and eﬀective range obtained from correlations
in Figs. 2 and 3 consistent with the correct Ps-H binding
[19]. The triplet scattering lengths for the one-, three-,

5

and ﬁve-state models, which do not provide any correla-
tion, are 1.83a0, 1.69a0, and 1.68a0, respectively.

The model calculation leads to reasonable convergence
for cross section and phase shifts at low energies as the
number of states is increased. This is illustrated for
low-energy cross sections in Table II for diﬀerent basis
sets. Finally, we present the low-energy phase shifts and
quenching cross sections of the ﬁve-state model in Table
III. As in Ref. [7], the quenching cross section has a min-
imum between 0 and 1 eV and a maximum between 1
and 2 eV. However, the low-energy quenching as well as
elastic cross sections are somewhat smaller than those of
Ref. [7] and are expected to be more converged.

In Fig.

5 we plot the Ps(1s)H(1s), Ps(2s)H(1s),
Ps(2p)H(1s), Ps(1s)H(2s), and Ps(1s)H(2p) cross sec-
tions for the ﬁve-state calculation, and the Born cross sec-
tions for n
3 Ps-excitations and Ps-ionization. These
cross sections are also exhibited in Table IV. The to-
tal cross section is plotted in Fig. 6 where we compare
our results with those of the 22-pseudo-state R-matrix
and three-state CCA calculations of Refs. [6,7]. In the
absence of experimental results on Ps-H scattering, we
compare the total cross section with the total Ps-H2 cross
) reduced by a factor of two [2]. This
section data (
•
should provide a fair comparison except at very low en-
ergies. The experimental trend, which clearly demon-
strates a broad maximum in the total cross section for all
the Ps-impact scattering problems around 20 eV [1] and
possibly a minimum near the Ps(2s) excitation thresh-
old [12], is correctly reproduced in our calculation. The
Ps-ionization cross section is largely responsible for pro-
ducing this trend in Ps-H scattering and also in Ps-He
and Ps-H2 scattering [12,14]. The 22-pseudo-state cal-
culations of Refs. [7,8] do not have this trend even after
including Ps-ionization and H-excitation and ionization
cross sections. The Ps-H cross sections of Ref. [6] shown
in Fig. 5 do not include higher excitations and ioniza-
tions of Ps and H; but the trend of their result suggests
that it may agree with the experimental trend of a maxi-
mum if these cross sections are included. However, at low
energies our cross sections are much smaller than those
of Refs. [6,7].

In this study we ﬁnd that the H-excitation cross sections are much smaller than the Ps-excitation cross sections
and the H-excitation channels have less eﬀect on the convergence of the solution at low energies compared to the
Ps-excitation channels. This is consistent with the fact that the polarizability of the H atom is one-eighth of that of
the Ps atom. In view of this, the diﬀerence between our low-energy results and those of Refs. [6,7] seems to be due
to their unconverged nature and not due to the neglect of H states in their model. This is explicit in their estimation
for Ps-H binding energies.

III. SUMMARY

We have performed a ﬁve-state calculation of Ps-H scattering using a recently proposed non-local model exchange
potential. The model considers excitation of both Ps and H atoms and yields cross sections for transitions to following
ﬁnal states starting from the initial state Ps(1s)H(1s): Ps(1s)H(1s), Ps(2s)H(1s), Ps(2p)H(1s), Ps(1s)H(2s), and
Ps(1s)H(2p). Higher excitations and ionization of the Ps atom are treated by the Born approximation including
exchange. The cross sections are in qualitative agreement with experimental trend. Our ﬁve-state model yields
singlet and triplet scattering lengths of 3.72a0 and 1.68a0, and the singlet eﬀective range of 1.67a0. The calculation
reproduces the singlet S-wave Ps-H resonance at 4.01 eV [18] and predicts a Ps-H binding energy of 1.05 eV compared
to the accurate binding energy of 1.067 eV [19]. This assures us as to the realistic nature of our model. We
observe correlations between the S-wave singlet Ps-H binding energy and singlet scattering length, eﬀective range,
and resonance energy obtained in diﬀerent calculations. These correlations of other observables with binding energy
demostrate the degree of convergence of various model calculations as can be seen in Figs. 2, 3, and 4. Considering
precise Ps-H binding energy of 1.067 eV, correlations in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest a singlet scattering length of 3.5a0 and

6

an eﬀective range of 1.65a0. The inclusion of higher-order states in our ﬁve-state model are not expected to inﬂuence
the low-energy results signiﬁcantly as has been demonstrated in Table II, but their eﬀect could be considerable at
medium to high energies. A further detailed calculation including these states will help to understand the dynamics
more precisely.

Abstract

The life-times due to Auger-electron emission for a hole on a deep elec-

tronic shell of neutral and charged sodium clusters are studied for diﬀerent

sizes. We consider spherical clusters and calculate the Auger-transition prob-

abilities using the energy levels and wave functions calculated in the Local-

Density-Approximation (LDA). We obtain that Auger emission processes are

energetically not allowed for neutral and positively charged sodium clusters.

In general, the Auger probabilities in small Na

−
N clusters are remarkably dif-

ferent from the atomic ones and exhibit a rich size dependence. The Auger

decay times of most of the cluster sizes studied are orders of magnitude larger

than in atoms and might be comparable with typical fragmentation times.

I. INTRODUCTION

The decay of an electronically excited cluster may take place by emission of electrons,

atoms or photons. It is generally accepted that the radiative cooling is the decay channel with

the largest time scale [1]. Another deexcitation channel is the evaporation of atoms, which

occurs within a characteristic time which ranges between pico- and milliseconds, depending

on the bonding character of the clusters and the excitation energy. The fastest relaxation

channel is the emission of photoelectrons. In addition, and like in atoms, secondary electrons

can be emitted if the excitation energy is larger than the ionization potential of the cluster.

These electrons result from intraband Auger processes, i.e., Auger decay of a valence hole

and subsequent emission of a valence electron.

In excited light atoms, the nonradiative decay through emission of Auger electrons has a

much larger probability than the radiative decay and dominates the relaxation process [2]. In

clusters there are so far neither experimental nor theoretical studies of the intraband Auger

probabilities. Recently, two important experimental studies on the deexcitation channels of

small clusters after optical excitation have been performed, from which the contribution of

Auger-processes can be inferred. Gantef¨or et al [3] analyzed the kinetic energy distribution of

electrons emitted from optically excited clusters. They found that the photoelectron spectra

show contributions from three diﬀerent processes: direct emission, thermionic emission,

and “inelastic scattered electrons”. The latter appear within a deﬁnite and narrow range

of kinetic energies. One could in principle interpret the inelastic scattered electrons as

coming from intraband Auger-processes. Reiners and Haberland [4] studied the competition

between electron and atom emission after photoabsorption as a function of the photon energy.

They observed that atom emission occurs within an energy range which is smaller than the

cluster bandwidth. This means that excitations consisting of a hole in the bottom of the

valence band (i.e., in the deepest electronic shells) do not lead to atom emission, despite

that their energy is larger than the binding energy. The authors conjectured that this is due

to intraband Auger-processes which lead to a very short life-time of such holes.

2

In this paper we present the ﬁrst calculations of the intraband Auger time scales in

metal clusters and show that Auger emission probabilities strongly depend on size and are,

in general, orders of magnitude smaller than atomic Auger probabilities.

II. THEORY

We consider only closed-shell NaN , Na+

N and Na−

N clusters and make use of their spherical

symmetry. For the description of the electronic structure of the clusters we use the jellium

model [5]. Through the Auger process, a vacancy in a state |n′′ℓ′′i, with εn′′ℓ′′ ≤ εF (εF

being the Fermi level), is ﬁlled by an electron coming from a higher bound level nℓ. The

energy released by this transition is transferred to a second electron, initially in a bound

state n′ℓ′, which is ejected (i.e., excited into a continuum state k). Thus, the initial state

consists of one hole in a bound state, and the ﬁnal state consists of two holes in bound states

and one electron in a continuum state. One can, however, consider the Auger process as

a two hole → two hole transition, where the initial state is given by |Ψii = cn′′ℓ′′σ ck |Ψki,

with |Ψki = c+
|Ψki, with
k |Ψ0i and εk > 0, and the ﬁnal state by |Ψf i = cnℓσ cn′ℓ′σ′
εn′ℓ′, εnℓ ≤ εF . k denotes the continuum state of the Auger electron and n′′ℓ′′, nℓ stand for

the states corresponding to the two ﬁnal holes. |Ψ0i refers to the electronic ground state of

the cluster. The Auger transition probability can be calculated using Fermi’s golden rule,

and is given by

where ρ(Ef ) corresponds to the density of ﬁnal states and ˆV is the operator describing the

Coulomb interactions, which is written as

expressed in the basis of eigenfunctions corresponding to the bound and continuum levels

of the cluster.

In order to calculate the Auger-emission probability of Eq. (1) we have ﬁrst to determine

the wave functions of the three bound states and that of the continuum state which is

involved in. This can be done by performing an approximation which is widely used in

atomic physics [2], and consists in taking the wave functions and energy levels of the original

system, i.e., the cluster before the creation of the initial vacancy. Therefore we solve the

Kohn-Sham equations for the spherical metal cluster, given by

where vj(~r ) is the electrostatic potential created by the jellium distribution of charge and

EXC[n(~r )] the exchange and correlation term [6]. n(~r ) is the electronic density. From

Eqs. (4) one obtains the bound states of the cluster. The numerical algorithm to solve

Eqs. (4) imposes the condition of regularity at the origin Rnℓ ∝ rℓ and ﬁxes the number of

nodes n of Rnℓ. There is only one solution for a ﬁxed n and ℓ which vanishes exponentially

at inﬁnity and the algorithm iterates to ﬁnd it, as well as its associated eigenvalue εnℓ. The

number of occupied shells determines the number of possible Auger processes for a given

hole in the shell n′′ℓ′′. Since the total energy is conserved during the transition (Ei = Ef ),

the kinetic energy εkℓk of the emitted Auger electron is given by εkℓk = |εn′′ℓ′′| − |εn′ℓ′| − |εnℓ|.

For a Auger emission to take place it must obviously hold that εkℓk > 0. Since also the

total angular momentum is conserved, the two-hole ﬁnal state must have the same angular

momentum as the two hole initial state (Li = Lf = L). This requires for the angular
momentum ℓk of the Auger electron the condition |L − ℓ′′| ≤ ℓk ≤ L + ℓ′′, where L must

4

satisfy the inequality |ℓ − ℓ′| ≤ L ≤ ℓ + ℓ′. Similar constraints are fulﬁlled by the spin

of the Auger electron. For the calculation of the Auger continuum wave function we also

use Eqs. (4). However, in this case the number of nodes is unknown and the continuum

energy εkℓk and the multipolarity ℓk are ﬁxed. The same regularity condition is used to start

the integration outwards, from the origin up to a ﬁxed large radius R0. We normalize the

outgoing Auger wave function ∼ exp(ikr)/r within a sphere of radius R0. Thus, the density

of ﬁnal states is given by ρ(Ef ) = R0/(2π¯hv), where v refers to the velocity of the Auger

electron [2].

In order to determine the Auger probability we ﬁrst separate the matrix elements (3)

into radial and angular factors. This is achieved by performing the multipole expansion

spherical harmonics. Evaluation of the angular factors depends on the choice of the angular-

momentum coupling scheme. Since for the valence electrons of clusters the spin-orbit cou-

pling is negligible, the initial and ﬁnal two-hole states of the cluster can be expressed in the

(LSJM) representation. The total transition probability into all possible states of L and S

is then given by [2]

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We have calculated the Auger transition probabilities for spherical (closed-shell) NaN ,

Na+

N and Na

−
N clusters with 19 ≤ N ≤ 253. For each cluster we have determined ﬁrst the

eﬀective potential Veﬀ (~r ), the bound Kohn-Sham states ({εnℓ} < 0) and the corresponding
radial eigenfunctions {Rnℓ(r)}. For a given vacancy n′′ℓ′′ we calculated the number of
possible ﬁnal states {nℓ, n′ℓ′}. For each of the ﬁnal states we determined the energy εk of

the emitted electron and the diﬀerent possible values of its angular momentum ℓk. Then, for

each ℓk, we determined the corresponding outgoing radial wave function. This allowed us to

calculate the Coulomb matrix elements and, using Eq. (6), the probability w(nℓ, n′ℓ′, n′′ℓ′′).

Finally, we have calculated the total probability for an initial vacancy n′′ℓ′′ as W (n′′ℓ′′) =

ℓℓ′ w(nℓ, n′ℓ′, n′′ℓ′′). The total probabilities W (n′′ℓ′′) can, of course, also be expressed as

P
an energy width [ΣA(n′′ℓ′′) = ¯h/W (n′′ℓ′′)] or as a life-time [τA(n′′ℓ′′) = W (n′′ℓ′′)−1].

The ﬁrst interesting result of our study is that, within the approximation used in Eq. (5)

for the exchange and correlation term (LDA), for neutral and positively charged spherical

sodium clusters intraband Auger processes are energetically forbidden. There is no possible

transition n′′ℓ′′, nℓ, n′ℓ′ yielding εk > 0. This means that, according to our LDA calculations,
excited spherical Na+

N and NaN clusters can only decay via fragmentation (evaporation) or

photon emission.

Our results for negatively charged sodium clusters indicate that, in contrast to what

occurs for Na+

N and NaN , nonradiative electronic decay is possible. Due to the presence

of the extra electron and the consequent extra Coulomb repulsion, the binding energy of

the electrons in negatively charged clusters is smaller than in neutral or positively charged

ones. As a consequence the whole band of bound states is shifted upwards and makes

possible Auger transitions with εk > 0. An example of such Auger transitions for negatively

charged sodium clusters is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. Note that the Kohn-Sham

eﬀective potential Veﬀ (r) shows a barrier for negatively charged clusters. This might have

consequences for the magnitude of the nonradiative emission probabilities. For instance, the

6

wave function of an emitted Auger-electron with positive energy but smaller than the energy

barrier could have a large weight inside the cluster due to trapping eﬀects and inﬂuence the

transition matrix elements used to calculate W . For holes in the ﬁrst two shells of Na−
N

there are many possible transitions. For instance, there are 6 ways of ﬁlling a 1s-vacancy in

Na−

39 by emitting an electron. For Na−

91 the number of such transitions is 11; for Na−

137, 14,

and for Na−

253, 19.

Our calculated Auger widths of Na−

N clusters are, for some cluster sizes, of the order

of 10−1 eV, i.e., as large as for light atoms.

In Fig. 2 the Auger life-time of a hole in

the ﬁrst (1s) and second (1p) shells of spherical Na−

N clusters is shown as a function of the

cluster size. The size dependence of τA(1s) and τA(1p) is very rich and shows no monotonical

behavior. Furthermore, the life-times oscillate over many orders of magnitude. For instance,

an initial 1s-hole in excited Na

−
39 and Na

−
67 lives only few femtoseconds, almost as short as

a 1s-vacancy in light atoms with Z < 10 [2]. For these clusters the Auger emission is

faster than any other deexcitation mechanism. This means that one can separate the time

scales for the electronic and atomic relaxation. Thus, if one is interested in studying, for

instance, the atomic motion after optical excitation of Na

−
39 and Na

−
67, one can assume that

the Auger process occurs immediately after the excitation and has no further inﬂuence on
the fragmentation (evaporation) behavior. On the other hand, τA(1s) for Na−
for Na−

57 are remarkable large, of the order of nanoseconds, i.e., larger that the

39 and Na−

57 and τA(1p)

life-times for any other deexcitation channel. For this other extreme case one can again

separate the time scales and assume that the hole lives inﬁnitely long (compared with the

atomic relaxation).

However, it is not always possible to perform this separation of time scales. Fig. 2 also

shows that for most cluster sizes τA lies between pico- and nanoseconds. This magnitudes

are comparable to the Auger life-times of positively charged ions approaching a metal surface

at a distance of at least 2 ˚A [7]. This time scale is probably in the range in which excited

clusters fragment [8]. Thus, results of Fig. 2 suggest that there might be competition between

Auger-emission and fragmentation channels for a vacancy in a deep shell of a Na−

N cluster.

7

In Fig. 3 the Auger life-time for initial vacancies in the diﬀerent electronic shells of Na−
137

are shown. The solid line shows results obtained from the calculations as described before,

whereas the dashed curve shows results obtained including relaxation eﬀects in the ﬁnal

state (shake-oﬀ). The ﬁnal state of the cluster corresponds actually to a system with N − 1

electrons. This should have an inﬂuence on the Kohn-Sham levels, reﬂecting the fact that the

many electron system relaxes due to the excess nuclear positive charge. For the cluster sizes

considered, which have closed shells in the initial state, the ﬁnal state with N − 1 electrons

is no longer a closed-shell system and cannot be calculated using the spherical jellium model

[9]. Thus, in order to take into account the relaxation eﬀects we performed the following

approach, commonly used in atomic physics [2]. We considered for both the initial and

the ﬁnal state a cluster with N electrons, i.e., a closed-shell conﬁguration. However, for

the ﬁnal state we solved the Kohn-Sham problem for a positive jellium background with

charge Q = |e|(N + 1). In this way we simulated the excess charge. The relaxation eﬀects

calculated within this approach do not change the qualitative trend of the results, neither for

the size dependence nor for the shell dependence (for ﬁxed size) of the Auger life-times, as

seen in Fig. 3. Regarding the shell-dependence of τA for the diﬀerent cluster sizes studied,

there is no clear dependence on the level of the initial vacancy. τA(1s) is in most cases

the smallest life-time. For some clusters τA(m) shows an alternation for increasing shell
number m = 1, 2, .., like for Na−

137. For other cluster sizes there is a monotonic increase

of τ (m) with m. In general one would expect a monotonic increase of the life-time, since

the Coulomb matrix elements [Eq. (3)] should decrease with increasing kinetic energy of the

Auger electron. However, due to the potential barrier shown in Fig. 1 and discussed below,

for some values of εk (resonances) the corresponding wave function could have a particular

large weight inside the cluster, giving rise to deviations from the monotonic dependence of

τA with energy. The potential barrier for Na

−
137 is 0.7 eV high.

In Fig. 4 we show the distribution P (ε) of the emitted Auger-electrons as a function of

their kinetic energies for Na−

137 and Na−

253. P (ε) is calculated as

8

P (ε) =

Aγ
2π

Xℓ,ℓ′,ℓ′′

w(nℓ, n′ℓ′, n′′ℓ′′)
(ε − εklk)2 + (γ/2)2 ,

(9)

where εklk(nℓ, n′ℓ′, n′′ℓ′′) is the energy of the electron emitted in the (nℓ, n′ℓ′, n′′ℓ′′)-Auger

process, and the width γ is taking to be 0.05 eV. A is a normalization constant. In both

cluster sizes P (ε) is dominated by electrons originated in few transitions with large probabil-

ity. For Na

−
137 the large peak at 1.23 eV corresponds to a (1s, 3p, 3p)-transition, whereas the

smaller peak at 0.66 eV results from a (1d, 3p, 3p)-process. For Na−

253 the Auger spectrum is

dominated by the (1p, 2h, 2h)-process with a kinetic energy of 0.5 eV, while a smaller peak

appears at 0.99 eV which corresponds to the (1s, 4s, 2h)-transition. These two examples are

consistent with the intuitive idea that the most probable Auger processes are those involving

two electrons at the Fermi-level (3p for Na−

137, and 2h in the case of Na−

253). Results of Fig. 4

remain unchanged if we take into account shake-oﬀ eﬀects. Note that the kinetic energies

of the emitted electrons are, for all clusters studied, not smaller than 0.4 eV and not larger

than 1.5 eV, which is roughly the diﬀerence between the bandwidth and the ionization po-

tential of the clusters. Thus, the kinetic energies of the Auger electrons concentrate in a

narrow energy range. Comparison with the experimental results by Gantef¨or et al [3] leads

us to argue that the photoelectron signal which cannot be explained as coming from direct

photoemission or thermionic eﬀects is due to intraband Auger processes. Regarding a com-

parison with experimental results by Reiners and Haberland [4], one can see in Fig. 2 that
the Auger life-time of a vacancy in the 1s-shell, τA(1s), of Na−

91 is approximately 100 ps,

whereas τA(1p) ∼ 10 ps. Since the time scale for evaporation is probably larger than these

values, our calculations suggest an explanation for the fact that light induced evaporation

in Na

−
91 takes place within a photon-energy range which is smaller than the bandwidth.

It is important to point out that our results are not sensitive to the particular form of the

functional used for the exchange and correlation term. We have found neither qualitative

nor appreciable quantitative diﬀerences by using the LDA functionals terms proposed by

Wigner [10], Gunnarson-Lundqvist [11], and the parametrizations by Perdew-Zunger [12]

and Vosko et al [13] to the Monte-Carlo calculations of Ceperley and Alder [14].

9

We have also performed a Hartree-Fock (HF) calculation of the energy levels [15]. In

contrast to the results obtained using LDA, the HF-treatment of the exchange term yields

that Auger-transitions for neutral and positively charged clusters are energetically allowed.

However, the number of possible transitions in NaN is much smaller than in Na

−
N , and for

Na+

N there are just a few Auger-processes. Thus, the HF-calculation conﬁrms the general

trends obtained using LDA.

IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

We have calculated the intraband Auger-decay probabilities of spherical sodium clusters.

Our results suggest that, for certain cluster sizes, there could be a competition between non-

radiative electronic and atomic deexcitation channels. We found that the Auger-probabilities

of small metal clusters are remarkably diﬀerent from the atomic ones. In view of the re-

sults presented in this paper it remains an interesting problem to study intraband Auger-

probabilities in nanostructures and ﬁlms and to compare them with the case of small clusters.

Also the study of spin-dependent Auger-processes in small magnetic clusters appears as a

possible interesting extension of this work.

We show that circularly polarized light can spin nanotubes
with GHz frequencies.
In this method, angular moments
of infrared photons are resonantly transferred to nanotube
phonons and passed to the tube body by “umklapp” scatter-
ing. We investigate experimental realization of this ultrafast
rotation in carbon nanotubes, levitating in an optical trap
and undergoing mechanical vibrations, and discuss possible
applications to rotating microdevices.

Carbon nanotubes [1] have unique mechanical and elec-
tronic properties with many potential applications [2].
They possess a huge Young modulus Y > 1 TPa, which
adjusts their autonomous mechanical oscillations to MHz
frequencies [3]. Moreover, their ”molecular structures”
remain naturally stable even at large deformations [4].

Therefore, rotationally symmetric structures based on
stiﬀ nanotubes could form ideal piston-rods for nanoscale
applications. In contrast to chemically driven bio-motors
[5], spinning with Hz frequencies, such tubular structures
could rotate very fast, if angular momentum is eﬃciently
transferred to them and friction is reduced.

Small heteropolar molecules can be dissociated [6], if
synchronously rotated with a dipolar laser trap, which
accelerates its angular velocity. Larger molecules [7] and
micro-particles [8] can be rotated by absorption of an-
gular momentum from circularly polarized or ”twisted”
laser beams. Nanotubes are excellent candidates for this
asynchronous driving, where the system rotational fre-
quency is much smaller than the light frequency.

Here, we investigate ultrafast asynchronous rotation
induced in nanotubes by excitation of their vibrational
modes with circularly polarized light. The mode selection
is restricted by radiational heating, since each photon
absorbed by the tube transfers to it angular momentum
¯h and energy ¯hω. The resulting heating can be limited
in excitation of infrared (IR) A2u or E1u phonon modes,
active in graphite [9] and nanotubes [10].

In Fig. 1 we show two schemes for spinning nanotubes.
In the upper one, circularly polarized light beam propa-
gates along the symmetry axis of the single-wall (SWNT)
or multi-wall (MWNT) nanotube, levitating in an opti-
cal trap. The photon angular momentum is transferred
to circularly polarized phonons, counter-propagating on
the tube circumference (see Fig. 2), and latter passed by
scattering to the tube body. The angular momentum of
light could be also directly passed to the nanotube in ex-
citation of its dense rotational levels. The resulting tube
rotation with angular frequency ωrot is mostly balanced

tation is induced by absorption of circularly polarized pho-
tons from a laser beam with intensity E+, propagating along
the axis of rotational symmetry. Scattering of molecules with
tubes damps the rotation.

by friction with the surrounding molecules. In the lower
conﬁguration, a closed nanotube ring [11] is analogously
rotated by absorption of circularly polarized photons.

We can describe the excitation of nanotube phonons by
circularly polarized light, and the subsequent relaxation,
with the simpliﬁed Hamiltonian

the same polarization. The third term denotes decay of
these IR phonons, with wave vectors k
0, into phonon
k, which most likely
pairs with opposite wave vectors
come from the same acoustical branch [13,14]. These
also can not carry angular quasi-momentum L, which is
passed to the tube by umklapp processes. The result-
ing tube rotation is predominantly damped by scattering
with molecules, as described in Hd [15].

We can understand the angular quasi-momentum umk-
lapp processes by unrolling the nanotube, and loosely
binding many such sheets into a superlattice of lattice
constant as = 2πr, where r is the tube diameter. Then,
the IR phonons modes have the transversal wave vec-
tor K0 = 2π/as, which falls in the middle of the sec-
ond Brillouin mini-zone of size Q = K0.
In a two-
phonon umklapp decay, the momentum conservation is
K0 + K1 + K2 = Q (transversal wave vectors of the de-
cayed acoustical phonons are K1,2 = 0), where the vector
Q interconnects centers of the ﬁrst and second mini-zone.
In the nanotube, we can vector multiply this identity by

nanotube. In the A2u and E1u modes, the atoms move
out-of-plane and in-plane, respectively, orthogonal to the
tube axis [16], as shown by open circles. Combination of
the two degenerate linearly polarized modes forms a cir-
cularly polarized phonon mode, of either symmetry, which
can absorb angular quasi-momentum from circularly po-
larized photons. The atomic displacements break the
tube symmetry and induce electric dipoles (+ -), which
follow in time the polarization of the circulating electric
ﬁeld E+. The eﬀect does not rely on coherent light and
can be also realized in tubular rings (see Fig. 1).

As an example, we consider excitation of the A2u mode.

two orders of magnitude the acceleration obtained with

for a = 1011 g the force on each C atom, F
still negligible with respect to chemical forces (1 eV/˚A),
the tube rotation could be further increased. On this
path to “tera-gravity”, unique parameters of nanotubes
can play a pivotal role.

We can now discuss in more details practical spin-
ning experiments. Isolated SWNT or MWNT have been
grown, for example, on an AFM tip [23], which can be
later placed inside an optical trap. The nanotube can be
severed from the tip using, for instance, a focused elec-
tron beam [24]. Detached tubes could be also transported
to the trap by recently developed nano-tweezers [25]. The
optical trap can be formed by two linearly and mutually
parallel polarized counter-propagating laser beams [26].
Nonresonant scattering of trap-beam photons from the
nanotube with polarizability α produces a force, oriented
in the direction of increasing light intensity I, that re-

ing nanotubes [27] are quite diﬀerent, and this diﬀerence
is even larger in metallic tubes. Therefore, the tube in
the trap remains oriented along the beam polarization
axis, where it experiences the trapping potential

Small amounts of defects and adsorbants on the tube

tion frequency. In accordance with the De Laval principle
of self-balancing [20], such a partially-coated nanotube
ﬂoating in the trap would rotate around an eccentric axis.
Rapid rotation of the nanotube can be also limited by its
mechanical vibrations in the trap, as discussed below. To
avoid its large oscillations, the critical frequencies should
be quickly passed during the acceleration [19,20].

In long nanotubes, one needs to consider also ﬂexural
vibrations [18–20]. The critical ﬂexural frequencies ωf
can be evaluated from the equations for lateral deﬂections

tubes of diﬀerent lengths. The huge Young modulus Y
makes the density of critical frequencies ωf n relatively
low, especially for short nanotubes. This allows for a
rapid traversal to the “supercritical state”, which is real-
ized above the ﬂexural or other vibrational frequencies.
Rotating nanotubes could form parts of nano-motors,
centrifuges or stabilizers. Centrifugal studies could be
performed inside microtubes with large diameters d
≈
10 µm [29] or in assemblies made from nanotube rings,
forming strong but ﬂexible skeletal coats. One could also
think about possible applications of rotating tubes in liq-
uids. Slowly rotating coiled nanotubes [30] could, for ex-
ample, propel microscopic systems, which would chem-
ically power the rotation of these tubes that attached
to their surfaces in bearings [31], as in bio-motors. We
believe that unique properties of nanotubes made from
carbon and other materials could foster applications with
rotating micro-elements.

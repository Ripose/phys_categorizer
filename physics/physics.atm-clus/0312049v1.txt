Melting in Nan clusters described with an empirical embedded-atom potential has been reexam-
ined in the size range 55 ≤ n ≤ 147 with a special attention at sizes close to 130. Contrary to
previous ﬁndings, premelting eﬀects are also present at such medium sizes, and they turn out to
be even stronger than the melting process itself for Na133 or Na135. These results indicate that the
empirical potential is qualitatively unadequate to model sodium clusters.

Introduction

required for a precise computation of the melting point
above 50 atoms.

The early days of cluster thermodynamics were ﬁrst
mostly concerned with theoretical of numerical studies
of simple rare-gas aggregates. Beyond the now generally
accepted idea that melting in ﬁnite atomic clusters ap-
pears as a ﬁrst-order transition rounded by size eﬀects,1
it was also observed in simulations that these system can
exhibit dynamical coexistence,2 a process in which the
cluster ﬂuctuates in time between its solidlike and liq-
uidlike states.

While no experiment has yet permitted to test these
predictions on the very same clusters, recent observations
achieved in the group lead by Haberland3,4,5 have pro-
vided valuable qualitative and quantitative information
about the way sodium clusters melt, by extracting the full
caloric curves from photodissociation measurements. In
particular these authors reported that the melting point
and the latent heat of fusion both vary strongly and non-
montonically with size.4 These results signiﬁcantly at-
tracted the attention of theoreticians, who since then
tried to interpret or reproduce these unexpected com-
plex variations using a variety of models.6,7,8,9,10,11,12
Further evidence was also seeked in indicators, which
are alternative to the caloric curves, such as the elec-
tric polarizability,13 the photoabsorption spectrum,14 or
the ionization potential.11

Up to now, none of the above cited theoretical works
has been able to reach a fully satisfactory quantitative
agreement with experiments. The situation is largely
due to the expected strong interplay between geomet-
ric and electronic eﬀects, which could be responsible for
the variations of the thermodynamic quantities. How-
ever, the previous simulations have brought some clues
about the relevance of the various models and potentials
used to describe simple metal clusters. For instance, it
was seen that the distance dependent tight-binding (TB)
model developed by Poteau and Spiegelman15 overesti-
mated melting points by more than 20 percents. This
was interpreted as the consequence of the parameteriza-
tion of this model, carried out on small clusters only but
not on bulk properties.7 On the other hand, both the em-
pirical embedded-atom model (EAM) potential6,7,11,12
and orbital-free density functional9 calculations lead to
a notable underestimation. Unfortunately, more realistic
simulations still lack the extent of phase space sampling

Numerical experiments

In our previous works, we concluded that melting in
sodium clusters actually occurs diﬀerently in the small-
est and in medium to large sizes clusters.6,7 While the
caloric curve of the smallest clusters (having less than
about 80 atoms) exhibit several features due to multi-
ple isomerizations prior melting, the heat capacity of the
larger sizes mainly has one main peak indicating melt-
ing in a non ambiguous way. This could partly explain
why experimental measurements do not ﬁnd such pre-
melting features above 55 atoms, and also why they have
diﬃculties in getting a clear, single-peak picture below
this size. More recently we noticed that premelting ef-
fects could also be artefactually due to poorly converged
simulations.8

Based on our previous results, the disagreement be-
tween experimental measurements and the results of both
the TB and EAM models seemed mostly quantitative.
One could hope in getting a much better agreement by
suitably modifying the parameters, after including both
molecular and bulk properties, possibly through allowing
these parameters to become size-dependent. However,
the range of sizes that was investigated by us and by
others was quite limited,6,7,11,12 with only very few sizes
above 80. Moreover, the mediocre agreement for the la-
tent heats of fusion lead us revisit the problem with newly
available simulation methods and less ambiguous tools of
analysis.

We have performed exchange Monte Carlo canonical
simulations16 of the clusters Nan with 55 ≤ n ≤ 145,
n being a multiple of 5 in this range, plus the following
sizes n = 59, 93, 127, 129–131, 133, 139, 142, and 147.
The clusters are again described using the same empirical
many-body EAM potential whose parameters are given
in Ref. 17, and each simulation consisted of 107 cycles fol-
lowing 2 × 106 equilibration cycles for each of the 31 tra-
jectories characterized by their temperature Ti = i×10 K
for 1 ≤ i ≤ 30 plus i = 1.5. The starting structures for
all clusters was always chosen to be the result of basin-
hopping global optimization carried out with 10 sets of
104 quenches. All were found to be based on the icosahe-

dral motif. The absence of any diﬀerent structural mo-
tif such as octahedral or decahedral for the sizes studied
here is very favorable for the simulations to reach equilib-
rium and not fall into broken ergodicity problems, as one
major cause for such diﬃculties precisely lies in the en-
ergy landscape having several funnels.18,19 Each cluster
was simulated 5 times independently, with diﬀerent ran-
dom seeds, and we used a hard-wall spherical container
with radius Rmax = 7n1/3. The caloric curves were con-
structed from the distributions of potential energies using
a multihistogram technique. In Ref. 7, we calculated the
latent heat of melting, L, as the integral of the heat ca-
pacity minus the Dulong-Petit contribution. This lead
to appreciable overestimates, mostly due to the neglect
of anharmonicities. Here we proceed similarly to the ex-
perimental approach of Schmidt and coworkers,4 namely
by ﬁtting the low- and high-temperature parts of the in-
ternal energy as straight lines and deﬁning L as the gap
between these lines at the melting point Tmelt. The melt-
ing point itself is deﬁned as the temperature at which the
last heat capacity peak has its maximum: in cases where
there are several peaks each centered around T (k)
melt the
true melting temperature is taken as maxk{T (k)
melt}. The
low- and high-temperature parts are deﬁned as T ≤ 50 K
and T ≥ 250 K, respectively. Therefore, if premelting
events are present between these limits, they will con-
tribute to the latent heat.

FIG. 1: Melting point Tmelt and latent heat of melting L of
sodium cluster clusters versus their size. The open squares
are the experimental results of Schmidt et al.5, the full circles
are for Monte Carlo simulations using the empirical potential.

The variations of Tmelt and L with size are sketched in
Fig. 1 along with the latest experimental data of Schmidt

2

and coworkers.5 Except for very low sizes, we ﬁrst no-
tice that the melting points computed here are signiﬁ-
cantly lower than the ones we previously reported.7 This
is an unfortunate consequence of using the q-jumping
method with un inappropriate Tsallis parameter.20 How-
ever they are comparable to the ones obtained by Garz´on
and coworkers in the microcanonical ensemble.12 Since
we expect the diﬀerences between this ensemble and the
canonical ensemble to become smaller and smaller for
increasing sizes, this agreement appear as a mutual con-
ﬁrmation of the convergence of both calculations, even
though they rely on very diﬀerent numerical experiments.
Interestingly, the experimental and theoretical varia-
tions of Tmelt with size appear to be related to each other,
especially if we shift the simulation data around size 120
by about 15 atoms and 70 K. This had not been noticed
before, and is probably fortuitous. But it may also hide
that some mechanisms causing the strong variations in
the experimental results close to 140 atoms are indeed
the same here, only occuring sooner.

In Fig. 1 one should also notice that the melting point
at n = 55 is not the highest, as clusters having 59 or 60
atoms are more resistant to an increase in temperature.
However, we were not able to extract any latent heat for
these sizes (nor for n = 65 and 70) due to very broad heat
capacity peaks. Therefore one should maybe not give too
much importance to the melting points extracted from
these curves.

While the melting temperatures are usually well be-
low the experimental data (except in the vicinity of 130
atoms), the computed latent heats show a reasonable
overall agreement, even though the complex variations
are not as sharply seen as in the measurements of Schmidt
et al.8 A deﬁnitive comparison would require one to ex-
tend the range of sizes. As far as latent heats are con-
cerned, the diﬀerence between the present results and our
previously published data7 comes nearly entirely from the
diﬀerent way of estimating L, which is now much closer
to the experimental way.

The heat capacity curves in the range 125 ≤ n ≤ 135
are all plotted in Fig. 2 versus temperature. Despite
strong changes from one size to another, a regular evo-
lution can be seen from 125 atoms and above this size.
The heat capacity consists of two peaks, the melting (or
high-temperature) peak being centered near 203 K. The
smaller peak, denoted as premelting peak in the follow-
ing, goes from 100 to about 180 K in a quite continuous
fashion. The premelting peak is surprisingly strong, and
can be clearly distinguished from the melting peak. Strik-
ingly, it is even stronger than the melting peak itself at
size 133.

To interpret these curves, we have chosen to focus on
Na133, by carrying periodic quenches from instantaneous
conﬁgurations extracted from the Monte Carlo simula-
tions for all trajectories. We thus gathered nearly 14000
diﬀerent isomers. Fig. 3 shows the energy of these iso-
mers versus their rank, as well as the discrete spectrum
of isomers versus the temperature of the trajectory from

which they were quenched. Both graphs clearly indicate
a correlation between the repartition of isomers in energy
space, their number and the heat capacities. Small vari-
ations in Cv occur below 150 K, but are hardly visible
when compared to the main peaks. They are related to
the ﬁrst few hundreds of isomers, which involve the mi-
gration of a limited number of some of the missing atoms
on the external layer of the icosahedron (the 135-atom
cluster has Ih symmetry with all vertex atoms missing).
The presence of two major peaks in Cv is consistent
with the two main increases in the number of isomers
having less than a given energy. Most new isomers ap-
pearing between 150 and 190 K have their rank between
1000 and 5000 in the upper part of Fig. 3. Looking at
their structure reveals that they are all still based on the
two-layer icosahedron, but that the third layer is hardly
recognisable. Hence this case of premelting is an extreme
illustration of surface melting following preliminar sur-
face reconstruction.21 Eventually, above 200 K the icosa-
hedral structure is completely lost and the true (volume)
melting takes place.

If now we look more closely at the results obtained for
Na135, we notice that the main peak is indeed located at
the same temperature as the premelting peak in Na133,
and that the true melting peak of the latter cluster has
been replaced by a right shoulder. Thus the same phe-
nomena seem to be present in Na135, only with diﬀerent
relative magnitude. This case could be referred to as
’post-melting’.

To some extent, this progressive evolution of the pre-
melting and melting peaks can be compared to what has
been observed in small Lennard-Jones (LJ) clusters by
Frantz.22 In these systems, a premelting peak starts ap-

pearing close to the size 31 corresponding to the compe-
tition between Mackay-type and anti-Mackay-type icosa-
hedral structures. The premelting peak remains as the
cluster size increases, and it is shifted to higher tempera-
tures before becoming higher than the melting peak itself
near the size 38.22 Because of the structural similarities
between LJ clusters and the present sodium clusters, it
is likely that the present observations express the same
qualitative mechanisms. However, a signiﬁcant quanti-
tative diﬀerence can be seen in the caloric curves of LJ
clusters and sodium clusters, as the melting peak is never
really well resolved for van der Waals systems until it has
replaced the premelting peak. Here the two peaks are
of very similar widths, but their respective heights vary
strongly, their total contribution to the latent heat being
nearly constant.

Up to now, experimental data did not ﬁnd any evi-
dence for any pronounced premelting peak in the heat
capacities of charged sodium clusters.3,4,5 This indicates
that the present empirical potential is qualitatively unad-
equate to describe these systems. In particular, beyond
a simple scaling of the parameters of the potential, we
do not expect the use of explicit, size-dependent param-
eters to improve the situation notably. We repeated the
above simulation for Na133 using the more realistic quan-
tum distance-dependent tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian
described in Ref. 15, but we had to reduce the statistics

to 106 cycles following 2 × 105 equilibration cycles (per
trajectory) for the computation to be tractable. Even
though melting points were shown to be overestimated,7
we also noticed8 that premelting eﬀects were quite re-
duced using this model, in better consistency with ex-
periments. The heat capacity computed from exchange
Monte Carlo simulations is reported in the inset of Fig. 2.
For this calculation we neglected the (weak) eﬀects of
nonzero electronic temperature.8 The starting conﬁgura-
tion was taken as the same one as for the classical poten-
tial, but we did not ﬁnd any more stable structure during
the course of the simulation.

At ﬁrst sight, the caloric curve looks similar to the
classical result, with a clear premelting peak. However
using the TB Hamiltonian has two consequences. First,
the premelting peak is much lower than the melting peak,
which is in agreement with our previous general observa-
tion that the empirical potential overemphasizes premelt-
ing features.7,8 More importantly, premelting also occurs
much closer in temperature to the melting peak itself.
This also suggest that premelting is not seen experimen-
tally simply because it is too broad.

Conclusion

In the present work, we have obtained some evidence
that premelting eﬀects in the caloric curves of sodium
clusters could be present at unexpectingly large sizes.
We also found that some clusters could exhibit ’post-
melting’, a process in which the premelting eﬀect is
stronger than the actual melting peak. In the cases stud-

4

ied here, these eﬀects seem to be associated with sur-
face reconstruction of the third icosahedral layer, and
thus seem to be of character similar to what occurs in
Lennard-Jones clusters having about 35 atoms.22

One consequence of the above results is that explicit
empirical potentials are not fully reliable for predicting
melting points in small sodium clusters, not only because
they do not allow one to reproduce the complex variations
observed by the group of Haberland,4 but mostly because
they exhibit prominent premelting peaks not seen in ex-
periments.

Calculations performed using the quantum tight-
binding model also predict a premelting phenomenon
near 133 atoms, but the corresponding anomaly of the
heat capacity is much smaller than the melting peak, as
well as closer to it. In this respect, it resembles more the
measurements by Schmidt et al.4

Even though our calculations overestimate premelting
eﬀects, they provide insight into the possible causes for
the nonmonotonic variations of the melting point.
In
particular, they suggest that such variations may reﬂect
premelting becoming actual melting. The discrepancies
with the present work would then be ascribed to a pos-
sible merging of the premelting feature into one shoulder
of the melting peak, but not necessarily on the low tem-
perature side.

Abstract

A crystalline form of LiBC is known which has been predicted to be superconduct-
ing, with a Tc comparable to that of MgB2. In both compounds, superconductivity
is enhanced by the presence of two electronic bands, one of which is close to a di-
mensional crossover. Here, we take a quantum chemical approach, and investigate
the structural and electronic properties of small clusters (LiBC)n (n = 1 − 4). With
increasing cluster size, we ﬁnd that several properties of crystalline LiBC evolve
naturally from the corresponding properties of the clusters. In particular, one may
recognize the origin of the solid bilayered structure, typical of magnesium diboride,
and the character of the electronic σ-band, arising from the overlap of the atomic
orbitals in the in-plane BC rings. Two aspects especially emphasized are (a) the
HOMO-LUMO gap as function of n and (b) the role of diﬀerent spin multiplicity.

A crystalline form of hole-doped LiBC has been studied, which has been pre-
dicted to be superconducting with a transition temperature Tc comparable
to that of the isoelectronic compound MgB2 [1,2]. The structure of LiBC is
closely related to the bilayered structure of MgB2, with Li replacing Mg, and
B2 being replaced by BC, but with hexagonal BC layers alternating so that B
is nearest neighbour to C both within the in-plane rings, and along the c axis.
Although the number of valence electrons decreases by one in replacing Mg

with Li, this is compensated by the substitution of B2 by BC. At variance
with its similarities with MgB2, a distinctive feature of LiBC is that the Li
content in LixBC can be varied with respect to its stoichiometric value x = 1,
without any appreciable change of crystalline structure for a quite wide range
in x = 0.24 − 1 [1], thus allowing to study the superconducting properties of
this material upon self-hole-doping.

Both MgB2 and LiBC are characterized by a similar electronic structure, with
a three-dimensional (3D) σ subband, mainly arising from the B2 (respectively,
BC) layers, and a quasi-bi-dimensional (quasi-2D) π subband, mainly arising
from the electrons delocalization across the layers. The relevance of the prox-
imity of the π subband to a 3D–2D crossover, i.e. an electronic topological
transition, for the dependence of Tc and of the isotope exponent on doping has
been emphasized elsewhere within the two-band model of superconductivity
[3].

Thus, it would be natural to think of both structural and electronic properties
of crystalline LiBC as arising from the underlying structural and electronic
properties of the individual LiBC units. This has motivated the present study
of the electronic structure of the small clusters (LiBC)n, with n going from
1 to 4. With increasing cluster size n, the solid crystalline and electronic
structure of LiBC can be approached, thus allowing one to recognize the origin
of the peculiar bilayered structure of the diborides, and the nature of their
two coupled electronic bands. The present study shows that such features are
already present in clusters (LiBC)n, with n as small as 4.

For these clusters the electronic stuctures, optimized geometries, and the vi-
brational analysis were obtained using the Gaussian 03 package [4], with ab
initio self-consistent ﬁeld Hartree-Fock wavefunctions at the 6-311+G(d) level
of the theory (including polarization and diﬀuse functions). Each cluster was
studied with various spin multiplicities depending on the number of possible
uncoupled valence electrons. Here, we report only those which attained a true
minimum.

At this level of accuracy of the electronic structure studies, we show in Fig. 1
the fully optimized geometrical conﬁguration of LiBC for diﬀerent spin multi-
plicities. Table 1 records the equilibrium bond lengths for Li–Li, Li–C, Li–B,
and B–C, for some of the clusters considered in this study.

One of the focal points of the present letter is the HOMO-LUMO energy gap
ǫHL of the various clusters considered. Therefore in Fig. 2 for n = 1 this gap is
recorded for the three spin multiplicities studied. There is not a huge spread of
ǫHL for n = 1 with spin multiplicity, but the smallest gap is when this quantity
is ∼ 5. The corresponding total Hartree-Fock energies are given in Tab. 2 for
the three diﬀerent spin multiplicities.

2

Turning to the case n = 2, two geometries are shown in Figs. 3a and 3b, with
the relevant equilibrium bond lengths recorded in Tab. 1. The ‘trans’ conﬁgu-
ration of Fig. 3, with multiplicity 3, has the lowest energy at the present level
of approximation. The corresponding energy gaps for the two conﬁgurations
are seen not to be very diﬀerent, with also a relatively weak dependence on
spin multiplicity.

The largest cluster studied here corresponds to n = 4. Fig. 4 shows the fully
optimized conﬁgurations of the four isomer quadruplet (LiBC)4 clusters. The
top row of this Figure has C2v symmetry, whereas the lower Figure symmetry
is C1. Studying stability via the normal mode vibrational frequencies, we ﬁnd
that some frequencies of the extreme right symmetry cluster in the top row of
Fig. 4 are imaginary, all the other isomers presented here being stable in this
context.

It is appropriate at this point to brieﬂy discuss the geometry of the (LiBC)4
clusters in relation to the crystalline solid form. The main point to emphasize
is that in Fig. 4 the three conﬁgurations for which the vibrational frequencies
are all real each contain a six-membered ring, consisting of alternating boron
and carbon atoms. However, orthogonal to the ring, each conﬁguration has
a Li dimer passing through the centre of the ring. Turning to the solid-state
structure, Fig. 1 of Ref. [1] contains two such BC hexagons again, which are
intercalated by Li layers. It should be stressed that adjacent hexagons in the
solid have no direct B–B or C–C bonds. One discerns a Li–Li axis passing
through the centre of the BC hexagons, establishing thereby close contact
with the cluster structures already discussed. From Table 1, one indeed ﬁnds
that the Li–Li distances range between 3.30 and 3.60 ˚A, to be compared and
contrasted with the interlayer Li–Li distance in solid LiBC, which is of 3.529 ˚A
[1].

Another analogy with the solid phase is provided by the electronic charge
distribution in the largest clusters examined in this study. Fig. 5 therefore
shows the Mulliken density charge isosurfaces of the valence electrons, for the
(LiBC)4 cluster with C1 symmetry (Fig. 4). One may detect the formation of
a ring of electronic charge piling between the C and B atoms, which preludes
to the σ band in solid LiBC [1].

Fig. 2 shows both a substantial lowering of the energy gap ǫHL with increase
in cluster size as well as a substantial spread in the values obtained for spin
multiplicity 9 for the four geometries depicted in Fig. 4. It is also of interest to
note that the dimer (LiBC)2 binding energy measured relative to the energy
of the two separated LiBC units is found from Table 2 to be ∼ 4 eV.

In conclusion, by using quantum chemical techniques, we have studied the
Aufbau of crystalline LiBC by gathering individual LiBC units into small

3

(LiBC)n clusters. In particular, we focussed on the structure optimization and
the computation of selected electronic properties, such the HOMO-LUMO
gap as a function of n and the Mulliken charge density distribution of the
largest cluster considered here (n = 4), which may provide insight into the
salient properties of crystalline LiBC. Already for n = 4 we can recognize
the formation of alternating BC rings, with signiﬁcant overlap of the valence
electrons along the ring, and comparably less electron delocalization in the
direction perpendicular to the ring, along which a Li–Li dimer is favoured to
align. This is reminiscent of the bilayered structure of crystalline LiBC, and
of its two-band electronic character, whose relevance for superconductivity is
well-known.

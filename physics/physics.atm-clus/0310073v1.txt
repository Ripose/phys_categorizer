Ionization of clusters in intense laser pulses through collective electron dynamics

Ulf Saalmann and Jan-Michael Rost

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The motion of electrons and ions in medium-sized rare gas clusters (∼ 1000 atoms) exposed to intense
laser pulses is studied microscopically by means of classical molecular dynamics using a hierarchical
tree code. Pulse parameters for optimum ionization are found to be wavelength dependent. This
resonant behavior is traced back to a collective electron oscillation inside the charged cluster. It
is shown that this dynamics can be well described by a driven and damped harmonic oscillator
allowing for a clear discrimination against other energy absorption mechanisms.

PACS numbers: 36.40.Gk, 31.15.Qg, 36.40.Wa

The interaction of of intense laser radiation with clus-
ters has been of continuing interest [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
pushed by prominent ﬁndings as the emission of keV-
photons [1], highly charged ions [2, 3], or fast fragments
[4]. Basically, all these phenomena are caused by the
exceedingly eﬀective absorption of energy from the laser
ﬁeld into the cluster. This enhanced absorption (when
compared to atoms or bulk matter) is possible due the
initially solid-like atomic density in the cluster in combi-
nation with the rapid expansion of the cluster on a fem-
tosecond time scale, i. e. typically during the laser pulse.
More detailed insight into the mechanism of energy ab-
sorption can be gained by pulse length variation. Using
pulses of equal energy, i. e. longer pulses have lower in-
tensities, it has been found that there is an optimum
pulse length with maximum absorption [5, 6]. This holds
true for small rare gas and metal clusters (of the order
of some 10 atoms) as well as for large clusters, although
the underlying reason for maximum absorption can be
very diﬀerent and is in fact an issue of current debate.
For small rare gas clusters under laser pulses of peak in-
tensities in the tunneling regime (I >
1015 W/cm2) such
∼
an optimum could be attributed to the mechanism of en-
hanced ionization [8] known from molecules [9]. For small
metal clusters exposed to similar laser pulses the exis-
tence of optimal absorption was interpreted as a plasmon
resonance phenomenon [6] in analogy to the well known
dipole resonance of the valence electrons in perturbative
photo-absorption [10] or low-intensity laser pulses [11].
For large clusters (of more than 105 atoms) it has been
proposed that strong laser pulses create a nanoplasma
inside the cluster [12, 13]. In the course of the expan-
sion of the cluster the electron density and consequently
the plasma frequency decreases resulting in strong energy
absorption at resonance with the laser.

Separating the diﬀerent mechanisms from each other
requires speciﬁc and clear signatures for each process
which are diﬃcult to identify in a multi particle system
such as a cluster. Surprisingly, dipole resonant absorp-
tion dynamics in a cluster can be very well characterized
by a simple driven damped harmonic oscillator, which
describes the dipole response of the electrons inside the
cluster.

In the following we will demonstrate the validity of this

we have been forced to use a completely new propagation

cosmology [16], the hierarchical tree code allows us to

Atoms are initially arranged in so-called Mackay icosa-
hedra [17] known to be optimal structures of Lennard-
Jones clusters. We distinguish between free and bound
electrons, whereby the latter ones are not treated explic-
itly. The condition for creation of an electron is that none
of the other electrons has a negative binding energy to
the ion under consideration. In this case a new electron
is “born” at the position of that ion with a kinetic energy
to satisfy the ionization potential. The charge of the ion
is increased by one. Free electrons as well as ions are
described classically as charged particles in an oscillating
ﬁeld interacting via a softened Coulomb interaction W .
This is deﬁned for a pair of particles with charges q1 and
q2 and a distance of r12 as W = q1 q2/√r12

First of all, we present the calculated pulse length de-
pendence for three diﬀerent laser wavelengths λ. Fig-
ure 1 shows the ﬁnal averaged charge state per atom
from Xe561 clusters after laser impact as a function of
the pulse length T or the peak intensity I, respectively.

Because of this attractive space charge, one may distin-
guish between inner ionization, which accounts for excita-
tion from localized electrons to quasi-free electrons mov-
ing inside the cluster volume, and outer ionization, which
corresponds to the ﬁnal escape of the quasi-free electrons
from the cluster into the continuum. Note, that the space
charge can hold an appreciable number of quasi-free elec-
trons which engage into collective motion discussed be-
low, in contrast to the ionization dynamics of molecules
or small clusters with almost no quasi-free electrons [8].
The charging up of the cluster leads to an expansion as

enough time to react on the charging, the ﬁnal charge
state decreases with an increasing pulse length due to the
lower intensity. For longer pulses (T >
50 fs), however,
∼
the ﬁnal charge state increases despite the intensities be-
come smaller. This can only be understood if one consid-
ers the expansion of the cluster, for a detailed explanation
see below. Finally, for very long pulses (T >
400 fs) the
∼
cluster is already completely fragmented before the laser
pulse reaches its peak intensity rendering the ionization
similar compared to the case of single atoms. Qualita-
tively, this behavior is the same for all three frequencies
(Fig. 1). However, the shift of the optimal pulse length
towards longer pulses for longer wavelengths is charac-
teristic for a resonant ionization mechanism.

To gain insight into the mechanism of ionization we
discuss the dynamics of a Xe923 cluster in a laser pulse
1014 W/cm2, cf. Fig. 2. The pulse has short
with I = 9
rise and fall times of 20 fs and a long plateau of 160 fs in
order to eliminate eﬀects from the time dependence of the
laser pulse itself. As can be clearly seen in Fig. 2a, the
cluster ionization occurs in two steps and the total cluster
charge Q (sum of total ionic charge Qion and charge of
those electrons which are inside the cluster volume) as a
function of time t is well represented by

can be seen for t >
60 fs in Fig. 2b. During the expan-
sion a 2nd ionization step occurs which lasts for a much
longer time and leads to an increase of the average ionic
charge from about 1 to more than 6. During this time,
the quasi-free electrons in the cluster are driven collec-
tively back and forth along the polarization direction of
the laser which is evident from their centre-of-mass (cm)
velocity vCM shown in Fig. 2c.

This oscillation can be modelled by a driven and

with X(t) the cm position of the electron cloud, F (t)
the driving laser amplitude, and Ωt and Γt the eigen-
frequency and damping rate, respectively, which are de-
termined by the cluster. The index t indicates that
due to ionization and expansion of the cluster, both,
Ωt and Γt, may depend parametrically on time. Under
the assumption of a spherical, uniformly charged clus-
ter with total ionic charge Qion and radius R the po-
tential inside the cluster is harmonic with an eigenfre-
Qion(t)/R(t)3. The damping is caused

two eﬀects are responsible for outer and inner ionization,
respectively.

φt changes in time from 0 to π, thereby passing the res-

the increased ionization of the cluster, cf. Fig. 2a. In par-
ticular, the resonance time tres coincides with the time
t2 of maximal ionization rate, cf. Eq. (2). This applies
to other laser wavelengths as well (For λ = 1170 nm t2

FIG. 3: Driven and damped harmonic oscillator: amplitude A
and phase shift φ as a function of the ratio of eigenfrequency
Ω and driving frequency ω according to Eqs. (4) for diﬀerent
damping strengths Γ.

Passing through the resonance is not necessarily con-
nected with large amplitude oscillations, if the damping
strength Γt is comparable to or larger than the eigenfre-
quency Ωt, see Fig. 3. Otherwise, the phase shift φt at
resonance is independent of the damping (Fig. 3).

In order to validate the applicability of the driven and
damped harmonic oscillator model of Eq. (3) we use am-
plitude At and phase shift φt of the collective oscillation
from our results of Fig. 2 to determine frequency and
damping rate according to

Figure 4 shows these parameters as a function of time
t for the same system as in Fig. 2. The calculated
eigenfrequency Ωt (gray circles in Fig. 4) closely resem-
bles the frequency of a uniformly charged sphere (solid
line). Moreover, both frequencies match the laser fre-
quency ω at the same time t
20 fs providing addi-
tional support for the collective oscillator model. Along
with the decrease of the eigenfrequency Ωt the damp-
ing term Γt (white diamonds in Fig. 4) rises for times
60 . . . 30 fs. This accounts for energy transfer to

and the high charge states of the fragments. At this point
it is interesting to note, that the damping almost com-

the almost negligible increase of the amplitude of vCM
before reaching the resonance (Fig. 2c). Once the clus-
ter has passed the resonance, however, the damping falls

Our microscopic calculations of the motion of ions and
electrons using a hierarchical tree code reveal a laser-
driven collective oscillation of the cloud of quasi-free elec-
trons which are held back inside the cluster volume by
the space charge of the cluster. The eigenfrequency of
this oscillation is determined by charge and size of the
cluster. Electron emission and cluster expansion change
these quantities in time and eventually enable the match-
ing of eigenfrequency Ωt and laser frequency ω during the
pulse. This resonance allows for an eﬀective energy trans-
fer to the collective motion. The changing phase shift be-
tween driving ﬁeld and driven electron cloud clearly indi-
cates the diﬀerent stages of energy absorption of the clus-
ter electrons from the laser ﬁeld. The fact that the collec-
tive electron dynamics can be well described by a simple
damped harmonic oscillator helps to clarify the nature
of this dynamics and provides a clear signature of this
type of collective dynamics. We expect that the other
two mechanisms for eﬀective energy absorption, namely
enhanced ionization and nanoplasma excitation will have
an almost vanishing amplitude for the electronic cm ve-
locity. Small clusters, which exhibit enhanced ionization,
produce only a few quasi-free electrons which cannot cre-
ate a sizable cm-velocity amplitude.
In large clusters,
however, where a nanoplasma is formed, electrons are
heated resonantly at their critical density leaving their
cm position at rest.

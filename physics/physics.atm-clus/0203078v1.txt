Chiral structures have been found as the lowest-energy isomers of bare (Au28 and Au55) and thiol-
passivated (Au28(SCH3)16 and Au38(SCH3)24) gold nanoclusters. The degree of chirality existing
in the chiral clusters was calculated using the Hausdorﬀ chirality measure. We found that the index
of chirality is higher in the passivated clusters and decreases with the cluster size. These results
are consistent with the observed chiroptical activity recently reported for glutahione-passivated gold
nanoclusters, and provide theoretical support for the existence of chirality in these novel compounds.

Detailed knowledge of the lattice structure, shape,
morphology, surface structure, and bonding of bare and
passivated gold clusters is fundamental to predict and un-
derstand their electronic, optical, and other physical and
chemical properties. This information is essential to op-
timizing their utilization as novel nanocatalysts [1], and
as building-blocks of new molecular nanostructured ma-
terials [2], with potential applications in nanoelectronics
[3] and biological diagnostics [4]. An eﬀective theoretical
approach to determine gold cluster structures is to com-
bine genetic algorithms and many-body potentials (to
perform global structural optimizations), and ﬁrst prin-
ciples density functional theory (to conﬁrm the energy
ordering of the local minima). Using this procedure we
recently found many topologically interesting disordered
gold nanoclusters with energy near or below the lowest-
energy ordered isomer [5–8]. The structures of these clus-
ters showed low spatial symmetry or no symmetry at
all, opening the possibility of having distinct electronic
and optical properties in such systems.
In other stud-
ies on passivated gold nanoclusters [9,10], we also found
that the eﬀect of a methylthiol monolayer (24
SCH3
molecules) on a truncated-octahedron (with fcc geome-
try) Au38 cluster is strong enough to produce a dramatic
distortion on the gold cluster, resulting in a disordered
geometry for the most stable Au38(SCH3)24 passivated
cluster.

Although the calculated structure factors of the dis-
ordered gold clusters were in qualitative agreement with
the data obtained from X-ray powder diﬀraction on ex-
perimental samples [6,7], the direct conﬁrmation of the
existence of bare and thiol-passivated gold nanoclusters
with low or no spatial symmetry had not been possi-
ble due to the lack of enough experimental resolution for
clusters in the size range of 1-2 nm [11–13]. Neverthe-
less, in a recent study using circular dichroism, Shaaﬀ
and Whetten (SW) [14] found a strong optical activ-
ity in the metal-based electronic transitions (across the
near-infrared, visible and near ultraviolet regions) of size-
separated glutathione-passivated gold clusters in the size

range of 20-40 Au atoms. SW pointed out that the most
plausible interpretation of these results is that the struc-
ture of the metal-cluster core of the gold-glutathione clus-
ter compounds would be inherently chiral. Moreover,
since the most abundant cluster in the experimental sam-
ples corresponds to the passivated cluster Au28(SG)16,
where SG denote the gluthatione adsorbate, SW pro-
posed a chiral structure, with T point group, for the Au28
cluster [14].

In earlier studies [5–10], we have reported several struc-
tural, vibrational and electronic properties of the disor-
dered gold nanoclusters. However, although an initial
quantiﬁcation of the amount and type of local disorder
present in amorphous-like structures of Au55 was ob-
tained [15], to our knowledge, no attempt to theoretically
investigate the existence of chirality in gold nanoclusters
In the light of the results ob-
has been done before.
tained by SW regarding the intense chiroptical activity of
size-separated glutathione-passivated gold nanoclusters,
it is of interest to determine if the most-stable disordered
structures we have found for bare and passivated gold
nanoclusters are chiral, and to quantify their degree of
chirality. In this letter, we present a structural analysis
that shows the existence of chirality in these nanostruc-
tures. This is done by implementing a method, based
on the Hausdorﬀ chirality measure [16,17], to quantify
the index of chirality of clusters. Our results show that
the metal cores of the passivated clusters are more chiral
than the bare clusters and that the degree of chirality de-
creases with the cluster size. These results provide new
insights on the eﬀect of passivating agents on the bare
metal cluster as a mechanism to generate chiral nanos-
tructures with novel and perhaps unexpected properties.

Our initial step was to determine the lowest-energy
structures of the bare and passivated gold nanoclusters.
To this end we ﬁrst performed global optimizations using
the Gupta n-body potential and a genetic-symbiotic al-
gorithm for bare gold nanoclusters of diﬀerent sizes (Ref.
[7] provides details on this methodology) . Through this
procedure we obtained the distribution in energy of the

1

most stable isomers for each cluster size. From this dis-
tribution, we selected representative isomers like those
with the lowest-energy, and those isomers that were con-
sidered good candidates to be the lowest-energy minima
based on the existence of well known symmetric struc-
tures for certain cluster sizes like the truncated octahe-
dron, icosahedron, decahedron, etc. The representative
isomers were then locally reoptimized through uncon-
strained relaxations using forces calculated from density
functional theory (DFT) in the local-density (LDA) and
generalized-gradient (GGA) approximations. The DFT
calculations were done using the Siesta code [18] with
scalar-relativistic norm-conserving pseudopotentials [19]
and a double-ζ basis set of numerical atomic orbitals [18]
(see Refs. [8,10] for additional details on these calcula-
tions).

Here, we report results for the Au28 cluster since the
lowest-energy structures for the Aun, n=38,55,75, clus-
ters have been published elsewhere [5–8]. Our results for
the Au28 cluster show a similar pattern as was found for
the larger sizes: the distribution of low-energy isomers
shows a set of nearly degenerate in energy disordered
structures, where the lowest-energy one corresponds to a
highly distorted geometry. The T structure proposed by
SW [14] was obtained as a local minimum of the potential
energy surface with higher energy. The top panel of Fig.
1 shows both cluster geometries and the distribution of
distances from the cluster center of mass. These struc-
tures mainly diﬀer in the presence of a 3-atom core in the
lowest-energy disordered isomer whereas the T geometry
contains a tetrahedral core. The DFT-LDA-GGA results
conﬁrm the higher stability of our disordered structure as
compared with the T structure: we obtained an energy
diﬀerence of -0.885 eV (LDA) and -0.638 eV (GGA) be-
tween both isomers. A similar trend, showing the higher
stability of disordered isomers with respect to ordered
ones, has been obtained for larger cluster sizes: Aun,
n=38,55,75 [5,8]. The physical origin of the higher sta-
bility of amorphous-like structures in bare gold nanoclus-
ters has been studied by analyzing the metallic bonding
and its eﬀect on the local stress of the clusters. It results
that the amorphization is a mechanism for strain relief
that lowers the cluster energy, being more prominent in
the case of gold due to the short-range of the n-body
metallic interaction [7,8,20].

The lowest-energy structures of the thiol-passivated
Au28(SCH3)16 and Au38(SCH3)24 clusters were obtained
by performing local relaxations, using the forces calcu-
lated from the DFT-LDA-GGA ﬁrst principles method,
and starting from diﬀerent cluster-monolayer conﬁgura-
tions. These include the lowest-energy ordered and dis-
ordered bare Au28 and Au38 cluster geometries obtained
by the procedure described above, with the methylthi-
ols molecules placed on diﬀerent adsorption sites (top,
bridge, hollow), as well as on random positions over the
metal cluster surface. Figure 2 (bottom panel) shows a

highly distorted passivated cluster that corresponds to
the lowest-energy structure of the Au28(SCH3)16 cluster,
obtained by the relaxation of the disordered bare Au28
cluster with the thiols placed close to 3-atom hollow sites.
From the distribution of radial distances to the cluster
center of mass shown in Fig. 2 (bottom panel), the degree
of distortion and the ill-deﬁned nature of the gold-thiol
interface is evident. A similar strongly distorted geome-
try was found for the lowest-energy structure of the larger
passivated Au38(SCH3)24 cluster [9,10]. The main driv-
ing force producing the cluster distortion is the strong
gold-sulphur interaction. An analysis of the metal-ligand
interaction in the gold passivated clusters will be pub-
lished elsewhere [21]. Meanwhile, recent calculations on
smaller Au-thiolate compounds have conﬁrmed that the
strong covalent (directional) gold-sulphur interaction is
mainly-responsible for the metal cluster distortion [22].
The principal objective of this work is to determine
if the disordered lowest-energy structures of the bare
Aun, n= 28,38,55,75, and passivated Au28(SCH3)16 and
Au38(SCH3)24 clusters are chiral, and to quantify the
degree of chirality existing in them. This information is
relevant for a proper interpretation of the circular dichro-
ism measurements performed by SW on glutathione-
passivated gold clusters [14]. Since chirality is a geomet-
rical property of the system, independent of its chemical
and physical manifestations, it is possible to quantify chi-
rality without reference to experimental measurements,
but using the inherent structural symmetry of the clus-
ters. Although in recent years several approaches have
been developed to measure chirality [23,24], the Haus-
dorﬀ chirality measure, proposed by Buda and Mislow
(BM) [16], has emerged as the general method of choice
for the quantiﬁcation of chirality [17]. Within this ap-
proach, the degree of chirality is found by calculating the
maximum overlap between the actual molecular struc-
ture and its mirror image, using the Hausdorﬀ distance
[25] between their sets of atomic coordinates. By rotating
and translating one structure with respect to the other,
the optimal overlap can be calculated. This Hausdorﬀ
chirality measure (HCM) is a continuous and similarity
invariant function of the molecular shape, and is zero
only if the molecule is achiral. The advantage of this
approach is that its numerical implementation for large
clusters containing n atoms in a three-dimensional space
is straightforward, as was discussed by BM [16,17]. Our
numerical procedure was tested by calculating the degree
of chirality of the three tetrahedra shapes considered by
BM, obtaining the same values as reported by these au-
thors [16].

We calculate the HCM for the lowest-energy structures
of the bare and thiol-passivated gold nanoclusters us-
ing their relaxed Cartesian coordinates measured with
respect to the cluster center of mass. Through an in-
version operation, the coordinates of the mirror image
clusters were obtained. The HCM was obtained by cal-

2

culating the maximum overlap between a given cluster
and its mirror image. This corresponds to the mini-
mum value of the Hausdorﬀ distance between the sets
of atomic coordinates of both structures. In order to ob-
tain the minimum Hausdorﬀ distance, the mirror cluster
was translated and rotated around the original cluster
in the three-dimensional space generating diﬀerent con-
ﬁgurations. For each of them, the Hausdorﬀ distance
with respect to the original cluster was calculated. The
minimum of these values, normalized by the largest inter-
atomic distance in the cluster, corresponds to the HCM.
To check the reliablity of this methodology, the minimiza-
tion of the Hausdorﬀ distance was performed using the
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shano method as suggested
in Refs. [16,17], a conjugate gradient optimization, and a
direct evaluation of the Hausdorﬀ distance taking varia-
tions of π/360 for each rotational angle. The HCM values
agree for the three methods up to the third signiﬁcant
digit.

Our results show that the HCM index of chirality for
Au38 and Au75 is zero. These values are expected since
the lowest-energy structures corresponding to these sizes
have one plane of symmetry and therefore are achiral.
In fact, these results constitute an additional test of our
numerical implementation for calculating HCM in large
clusters. The HCM index of chirality for the lowest-
energy structure and the T isomer proposed by SW for
Au28 are displayed in Table I, together with the value ob-
tained for the lowest-energy structure of Au55 (see Fig.
1 in Ref. [15]). These results show that the most stable
structure of Au28, obtained in this work, is less chiral
than the one proposed by SW, and that the index of
chirality varies slightly with the cluster size from 28 to
55 atoms. For the calculation of the HCM of the thiol-
passivated gold nanoclusters, we only consider the coor-
dinates of the Au atoms since we are interested in testing
the suggestion of SW who proposed that the metal clus-
ter core would be inherently chiral [14]. The HCM values
for the metal core of the passivated Au28(SCH3)16 and
Au38(SCH3)24 clusters are also shown in Table I. These
results show that both metal cluster cores are more chiral
than the bare Au28 and Au38 clusters, and that the index
of chirality for the passivated clusters decreases with the
cluster size. It is noteworthy that the HCM values ob-
tained for the bare and passivated chiral Au clusters are
smaller than the values of the chiral tetrahedral shapes
(HCM = 0.221, 0.252, 0.255 for D2, C2, and C1 tetrahe-
dra, respectively) obtained by BM [16]. In order to com-
pare the HCM of Au clusters with a physical system, we
calculated the index of chirality of the chiral D2-C76 and
D2-C84, and the achiral Ih-C60 fullerenes, obtaining the
values 0.109, 0.102, and 0.000, respectively. These results
support the reliability of our methodology since there is
experimental evidence on the existence of chirality in the
D2-C76 fullerene [26]. This comparison also provides a
useful reference to classify cluster and molecules in terms

of their indexes of chirality, and indicates that the bare
Au28 and Au55 clusters are as chiral as the D2-C76, but
the passivated Au28(SCH3)16 and Au38(SCH3)24 clusters
are slightly more chiral than such fullerene.

The above results on the existence of chirality in thiol-
passivated Au nanoclusters are consistent with the chi-
roptical activity measured on size-separated glutathione-
passivated gold nanoclusters in the size-range 20-40 Au
atoms since it was shown that the optical properties are
insensitive to the tail of the adsorbate thiol [14]. Also, in
the experimental samples it was found that the optical
activity is weaker as the cluster size increases, and it is
lost for larger clusters and for samples with mixed cluster
sizes [14]. It remains to be veriﬁed if indeed there is a
correlation between the value of the index of chirality and
the strength of the intensity or other spectral features of
the optical activity signal in the chiral samples. Another
interesting prediction from the present calculations, to
be conﬁrmed experimentally, is related with the smaller
index of chirality existing on bare clusters as compared
to those for the metal-core of passivated clusters. Our
results imply that the eﬀect of the passivating monolayer
is strong enough to distort a bare cluster geometry, pro-
ducing chiral metal-cores that give rise to the intense
chiroptical activity. This eﬀect could change an achiral
cluster into a chiral one, like in the Au38 case, or increase
the index of chirality in an already chiral structure, like
the Au28 cluster.

The main contribution of this theoretical work has
been to show the existence of, and quantify chirality in
the lowest-energy structures of gold nanoclusters using
the Hausdorﬀ chirality measure. These results provide
useful insights for a proper interpretation of the experi-
mental results that report optical activity on passivated
gold nanoclusters [14]. Our results also establish that
passivating with thiol monolayers provides a mechanism
to induce or increase chirality in bare Au clusters in the
size-range of 20-40 atoms. This new information is rel-
evant for the growth and sample preparation of diﬀer-
ent chiral metal nanoclusters. Theoretical precedents
on metallic chiral nanostructures would include the Ni28
cluster [27], and the Al and Pb helical nanowires [28],
however the present results and those obtained by SW
provide both theoretical and experimental evidence on
the existence of chirality in gold nanoclusters. Electronic,
optical, thermal, and other physical and chemical prop-
erties of chiral gold nanoclusters are currently being cal-
culated and will be reported in forthcoming publications.
At present, it is expected that novel and interesting prop-
erties emerge from the chiral character of metal clusters
that could be useful for new nanotechnological applica-
tions.

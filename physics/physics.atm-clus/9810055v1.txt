Summary

We present some recent progress achieved in the application of symmetry adaptation
techniques to n-photon absorption spectroscopy of rare earth ions in ﬁnite symmetry.
More speciﬁcally, this work is concerned with the determination of the intensity of n-
photon transitions between Stark levels (rather than J levels) of an ion in an environment
with a given symmetry. The role of symmetry is taken into account through the use of
initial and ﬁnal state vectors characterized by irreducible representations of the (double)
group for the ion site symmetry. Two distinct situations are considered, viz., the case
of parity-allowed n-photon transitions (as e.g. intra-conﬁgurational transitions between
Stark levels of the 4f N conﬁguration for n even) and the case of parity-forbidden n-
photon transitions (as e.g. inter-conﬁgurational transitions from Stark levels of the 4f N
conﬁguration to Stark levels of the 4f N−15d conﬁguration for n even).

1. Introduction

One- and two-photon spectroscopy [1-22] is a useful experimental tool for investigat-

ing the electronic properties of rare earth ions in crystals. The basic corresponding theo-

retical models have been developed by Judd [1] and Ofelt [2] for intra-conﬁgurational one-

photon transitions (see [20] for a recent review) and by Axe [3] for intra-conﬁgurational

two-photon transitions. The case of two-photon transitions has been the object of

further works and extensions : (i) introduction of higher-order mechanisms for intra-

conﬁgurational transitions [6,7,9,11], (ii) development of models for inter-conﬁgurational

transitions [10,12,15,21], and (iii) introduction of symmetry considerations from both a

qualitative [4,5] and a quantitative [13,14,18,19,21,22] viewpoint.

In this paper, we present a theoretical model for n-photon dipolar transitions which

includes, in a symmetry adapted form, the special cases n = 1 [1,2] and n = 2 [3].

The model is developed for an arbitrary conﬁguration of N equivalent electrons in any

symmetry G. Extensive use is made of symmetry adaptation techniques for the chain

1

O(3)∗ ⊃ G∗ (see [23]), where G∗ is the double group of the site symmetry group G.

The starting point of this work relies on the transition moment for an n-photon

absorption between an initial state i and a ﬁnal state f . In the framework of the electric

dipole approximation, it is given by the well-known formula

Mi→f =

1

¯hn−1 X
{vj }

(f |(E1. D)|v1) (v1|(E2. D)|v2) · · · (vn−1|(En. D)|i)
(Ωi − Ωv1 )(Ωi − Ωv2 ) · · · (Ωi − Ωvn−1)

+ permutations (1)

where the sum has to be extended over the intermediate states vj (j = 1, 2, · · · , n−1) and

permutations indicate that other terms must be added in order to take into account the

n! permutations on the n photons when they are diﬀerent. In equation (1), the operator

(Ek. D) stands for the scalar product of the polarization vector Ek of the k-th photon

(k = 1, 2, · · · , n) with the dipole moment operator D for the N electrons. Furthermore,

the energy denominators have their usual meaning.

At this stage, we have to make a sharp distinction between parity-allowed and parity-

forbidden n-photon transitions. We shall examine in turn (in sections 2 and 3) these two

types of transitions. In section 4, we shall report on intensity formulas for parity-allowed

and parity-forbidden transitions.

2. Parity-allowed n-photon transitions

In this case, the parity is a good quantum number for the initial, ﬁnal and intermedi-

ate states. In other words, the initial and ﬁnal states have the same parity for n even and

opposite parities for n odd. Among the parity-allowed n-photon transitions, we thus may

have intra-conﬁgurational transitions for n even and inter-conﬁgurational transitions for

n odd. Two particular cases are of special interest, viz., the intra-conﬁgurational two-

photon transitions (n = 2) and the inter-conﬁgurational one-photon transitions (n = 1).

For n 6= 1, the sum over {vj} in (1) is very diﬃcult to handle since the energy

denominators depend on the internal structure of the intermediate states. This situation

is analogous to that encountered in the study of one-photon (parity-forbidden) intra-

conﬁgurational transitions. Therefore, we shall use here a quasi-closure approximation

of the type introduced by Judd [1] and Ofelt [2] for 4f N → 4f N one-photon transi-

2

tions. As a net result, by using recoupling techniques in conjunction with a quasi-closure

approximation, the transition matrix element (1) is amenable to the form

Mi→f = (f Γ′γ′|Heﬀ|iΓγ)

(2)

with

Heﬀ =

C[λ1, λ2, · · · , λn−1]

λ1,λ2,···,λn−1

{· · · {{E1E2}λ1 E3}λ2 · · · En}λn−1. U λn−1
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(3)

where (.) indicates a scalar product.

In equation (2), the labels Γ and Γ′ stand for

two irreducible representations of the group G∗. Furthermore, γ and γ′ are multiplicity

labels. The labels Γγ and Γ′γ′ are the only good quantum numbers for the states i

and f , respectively. In equation (3), the electronic part is contained in the Racah unit

tensor U λn−1 while the polarization dependence is contained in the tensor { }λn−1 (which

describes the coupling of the n polarization vectors associated with the n photons). It

should be noted that λn−1 cannot be equal to 0 (except for Rayleigh scattering). The

C parameters depend on the initial, ﬁnal and intermediate conﬁgurations as well as the

energies of the n photons.

In the limiting case n = 1, equation (3) yields the operator

of relevance for inter-conﬁgurational one-photon transitions. In the special case n = 2,

equation (3) returns the eﬀective operator

Heﬀ = (E. D)

Heﬀ =

C[λ] ({E1E2}λ. U λ)

(5)

that describes intra-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions in the Axe model [3].

3. Parity-forbidden n-photon transitions

The n-photon transitions are forbidden (i.e., Mi→f = 0) between states of the same

parity for n odd and between states of opposite parities for n even. However, such transi-

tions are observed in some cases. As an example, we have the case, treated independently

3

by Judd [1] and Ofelt [2], of 4f N → 4f N (intra-conﬁgurational) one-photon (n = 1) tran-

sitions. Indeed, such transitions become weakly allowed owing to a violation mechanism

induced by the (static or dynamic) crystal-ﬁeld interaction.

Going back to the case when n is arbitrary, two parity violation mechanisms are

possible in order to pass from Mi→f = 0 to Mi→f 6= 0 :

(i) To use ﬁrst-order time-independent perturbation theory in order to replace the

initial, ﬁnal and intermediate state vectors in (1) by state vectors with a not well-deﬁned

parity, the parity mixing being due to the odd crystal-ﬁeld interaction.

(ii) To start from the transition matrix element for a parity-allowed (n + 1)-photon

transition and to replace one of the electric dipole operators (Ek. D) by the odd crystal-

ﬁeld interaction with appropriate permutations.

We shall refer the mechanisms described by (i) and (ii) to as M [n, 1] and M [n +1, 0],

respectively. The latter notation is a reminder that M [n, 1], respectively M [n + 1, 0],

is concerned with nth-order, respectively (n + 1)th-order, time-dependent perturbation

theory and 1st-order, respectively 0th-order, time-independent perturbation theory. It

can be shown that, under some approximation, we have M [n + 1, 0] ≈ M [n, 1] (see [21]

for a detailed proof in the case n = 2).

By using either the M [n, 1] or M [n + 1, 0] mechanism together with closure approxi-

mations and recoupling techniques, we can prove that the eﬀective operator to be placed

between the initial and the ﬁnal (0th-order) state vectors in equation (2) reads

Heﬀ =

{{· · · {{E1E2}λ1 E3}λ2 · · · En}λn−1Ok}λn . U λn

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(6)

Equation (6) should be compared with (3). In equation (6), the electronic part is de-

scribed by the Racah unit tensor U λn . The polarization information is contained in the

coupled tensor { }λn where Ok is a tensor whose components are deﬁned from the odd

crystal-ﬁeld parameters [14]. The index λn−1 can take here the value 0, in contradis-

tinction to parity-allowed n-photon transitions. The C parameters here parallel the ones

occurring in (3) but are given by a diﬀerent formula.

which describes intra-conﬁgurational one-photon transitions, cf. [1,2,14]. For n = 2,

4. Intensity formula

We are now in a position to give a formula for the intensity

of a (parity-allowed or parity-forbiddden) n-photon transition between the Stark levels i

of symmetry Γ and f of symmetry Γ′. In equation (9), the sums over γ and γ′ have to

be extended over all the components of the initial and ﬁnal states, respectively.

The calculation of SΓ→Γ′ may be achieved, by making use of symmetry adaptation

techniques [23], in the following way : (i) express the initial and ﬁnal states as well as

the scalar products occurring in (3) and (6) in a form adapted to the chain of groups

O(3)∗ ⊃ G∗; (ii) apply the Wigner-Eckart theorem for the chain O(3)∗ ⊃ G∗; (iii) use

the factorization lemma for the coupling coeﬃcients of the group O(3)∗ in an O(3)∗ ⊃

G∗ basis; and, ﬁnally (iv) use the so-called orthogonality-completeness property for the

Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients of the group G. We thus obtain the intensity formula

SΓ→Γ′ =

γ′′

(with 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1), the form of which holds for both parity-allowed and parity-forbidden

n-photon transitions. For a derivation of (10), the reader may consult [18] in the case of

5

intra-conﬁgurational parity-allowed two-photon transitions and [21] in the case of inter-

conﬁgurational parity-forbidden two-photon transitions.

The polarization dependence is clearly exhibited in (10) by the factors of type

P λn−1 = {· · · {{E1E2}λ1E3}λ2 · · · En}λn−1

(11)

which already occur in (3) and (6). Of course, the intensity parameters I are given by an

expression that is speciﬁc of the kind of transition (parity-allowed or parity-forbidden)

under consideration. The I parameters depend on the initial and ﬁnal states. They also

depend on various reduced matrix elements ( k k ) of spherical tensors and on several

energy parameters (for the involved conﬁgurations and the n photons). In the case of

parity-forbidden transitions, they depend on the odd crystal-ﬁeld parameters.

The I parameters present two interesting properties : (i) an hermitian conjugation

property and (ii) a factorization property when the symmetry group G is multiplicity-free

[22]. The number of I parameters in the intensity formula (10) is partially controlled

by property (i) and the following group-theoretical selection rules : (i) the irreducible

representation Γ′′ of G should be contained in the direct product Γ′∗ ⊗ Γ and (ii) the

irreducible representations (kn−1) and (ℓn−1) of O(3) should contain Γ′′. Let us also

emphasize that the number of I parameters depends as well on the number of absorbed

photons and that the higher the symmetry, the lower the number of I parameters.

5. Discussion

In this paper, we have concentrated on n-photon absorption between Stark lev-

els, with well-deﬁned symmetry species, for a transition ion (as, e.g., a rare earth ion)

in ﬁnite symmetry. We have obtained intensity formulas, for both parity-allowed and

parity-forbidden n-photon transitions, which incorporate all the information arising from

symmetry considerations. In the particular case n = 2, our results constitute a quanti-

tative counterpart to the qualitative treatment in [4,5]. (By quantitative we mean that

the intensity parameters are given by expressions arising from well-deﬁned mechanisms

and are calculable from ﬁrst principles.) The latter point shows that the tables of Bader

6

and Gold [5] can be used for inter-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions as well as for

intra-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions.

The parity violation mechanism used in the present paper for parity-forbidden n-

photon transitions is the same as the one introduced in the theory of Judd [1] and Ofelt

[2] for intra-conﬁgurational (4f N → 4f N ) one-photon transitions. Our treatment of

parity-forbidden n-photon transitions is an extension (to n arbitrary), in a symmetry

adapted form, of the one by Judd and Ofelt.

For parity-allowed n-photon transitions, we have obtained results which extend, in

a symmetry adapted form, the standard model of Axe [3] for intra-conﬁgurational two-

photon transitions.

We know that for intra-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions, some additional

mechanisms (additional with respect to the second-order mechanisms arising from second-

order time-dependent perturbation theory) have been introduced by various authors

[6,7,9,11] in order to produce more eﬃcient third- and fourth-order mechanisms. For in-

stance, the third-order mechanisms introduced by Judd and Pooler [6] arise from second-

order time-dependent perturbation theory plus ﬁrst-order time-independent perturbation

theory. Some additional mechanisms (including ligand-polarization eﬀects) also may be

introduced in the general case of parity-allowed and parity-forbidden n-photon transi-

tions. This may lead to the replacement in equations (3) and (6) of the Racah unit tensor

U by some more complicated tensor with, for example, a spin- and orbit-dependence. The

resulting intensity formula then assumes the same form as (10) (see [22]).

The intensity parameters I in (10) (involving possibly additional mechanisms) can

be calculated in principle in an ab initio way. This yields, however, a very intricate

quantum chemistry problem which requires the knowledge of precise wave-functions.

Therefore, it is often interesting to consider them, or part of them, as phenomenological

parameters, at least in a ﬁrst approach. In this connection, it should be emphasized that

a phenomenological approach may incoporate various mechanisms in a global way. This

may be an advantage, as well as an inconvenience because it is not always feasible to

7

distinguish the contributions arising from various mechanisms.

Up to now, most of the experimental results for n-photon absorption are concerned

with n = 1 and 2. The formalism used in the present paper has been applied for n = 2

to various rare earth and transition-metal ions in crystals (see [13,16,17,19]). We hope

that experimental data for polarization dependence of n-photon transitions will become

available in order to test the model developed in this paper.

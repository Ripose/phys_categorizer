Xenon Clusters in Intense VUV Laser Fields

(Dated: January 12, 2014)

A simple model is developed that quantitatively describes intense interactions of a VUV laser
pulse with a xenon cluster. We ﬁnd good agreement with a recent experiment [H. Wabnitz et al.,
Nature 420, 482 (2002)]. In particular, the large number of VUV photons absorbed per atom—at
intensities signiﬁcantly below 1016 W/cm2—is now understood.

PACS numbers: 32.80.-t,36.40.Gk,52.50.Jm,52.20.Fs

Little is known about laser–cluster interactions at UV
or higher photon energies. The destructive impact of
laser pulses with a peak intensity of almost 1019 W/cm2
at a wavelength of 248 nm was demonstrated by McPher-
son et al. [1]. However, intense laser ﬁelds at even higher
photon energies have not been accessible until very re-
cently. In 2000, the ﬁrst lasing—in a free-electron laser
(FEL)—at λ = 109 nm was reported [2]. The FEL is
part of the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) in Hamburg,
Germany. One of the major objectives of the TTF is
the development of the technology for an ultrabright x-
ray laser [3]. The new VUV laser source has already
displayed its capability for exploring interesting physics:
Motivated by the outstanding properties of the radiation
generated by the TTF FEL, documented in Ref. [4], re-
searchers in Hamburg exposed xenon atoms and clusters
to the intense VUV laser pulses [5].

Each laser pulse had a duration of about 100 fs and
consisted of 12.7-eV photons. The highest intensity in
the experiment was about 7 × 1013 W/cm2 [6]. Under
these conditions, isolated Xe atoms are found to be only
singly ionized. This observation is compatible with one-
photon absorption, as the ionization threshold of Xe is
12.1 eV [7]. Multiphoton processes apparently are of no
relevance. Clusters of 1000 atoms or more, on the other
hand, behave in a strikingly diﬀerent way: They absorb
at least 30 VUV photons per atom. The clusters are
completely destroyed, and ion charge states of up to 8+
can be detected.

It is the purpose of this Letter to elucidate the physics
underlying the experimental observations. We show that
the high eﬃciency of VUV photon absorption in xenon
clusters is due to inverse bremsstrahlung [8, 9, 10] in
combination with atomic-structure and plasma-screening
eﬀects. Nonlinear optical processes do not play a role.

Considering the relatively low intensity of the TTF
FEL, the experimental ﬁndings are rather surprising.
Producing similarly pronounced ionization and fragmen-
tation phenomena in noble gas clusters using near-
infrared lasers requires pulse intensities of 1016 W/cm2
or higher [11]. Under these circumstances, the clusters
are turned into microplasmas, and x-ray emission [12]
and highly energetic electrons [13] and ions [14] can be
observed.

The high intensity at long wavelengths serves two pur-
poses [15, 16, 17, 18]. On one hand, even though a noble

gas atom cannot be ionized by single near-infrared pho-
tons, some of the valence electrons can tunnel through,
or even escape over the potential barrier generated by the
ionic core and the strong quasistatic electric ﬁeld of the
laser. On the other hand, the average kinetic energy, or
ponderomotive potential, of an electron oscillating in the
laser ﬁeld can easily be of the order of 1 keV. This energy
can be released in collisional ionization, i.e., (e, 2e) type
reactions. Moreover, in energetic electron–ion collisions
a substantial number of photons can be absorbed from
the laser ﬁeld. This heating mechanism is referred to as
inverse bremsstrahlung (IBS).

At VUV photon energies, however, the ponderomotive
potential is only on the order of 10 meV. Indeed, numeri-
cal simulations and estimates in Ref. [5], which are based
on methods developed in the context of low-frequency
lasers [15, 17], predict the absorption of only a few pho-
tons per atom. This diﬀers from the experimental result
by more than an order of magnitude.

The photoionization cross section of neutral Xe at
~ω = 12.7 eV is roughly 50 Mb [19]. Hence, a pulse
with an intensity of 1013 W/cm2 ionizes all atoms in a
cluster within 10 fs. The resulting plasma bears some
similarity to a metal: The plasma electrons can move
freely, but because of the high atomic density there is
a high probability for electron–ion and electron–electron
collisions. Free electrons cannot absorb photons; neither
can photons be absorbed in electron–electron collisions
[10].

However, electron–ion collisions can extract energy
from the laser ﬁeld via IBS. Since we are considering rela-
tively moderate intensities and rather short wavelengths,
it is legitimate to treat this process perturbatively. Using
second-order perturbation theory (ﬁrst order in electron–
ion and electron–photon coupling, respectively) and as-
suming a cluster of inﬁnite spatial extension but constant
atomic density, one can derive a quantum-mechanical for-
mula for the heating rate per plasma electron. In our im-
plementation of the IBS heating rate, we avoided making
use of the classical limit ~ → 0, which is often taken in
the weak-ﬁeld case (see, for example, Ref. [8]), but which
is inappropriate for VUV photons. We exploit, however,
the fact that due to numerous collisions with ions and
electrons all directionality imprinted on the plasma elec-
trons by the linear polarization of the VUV laser ﬁeld
is lost and thermal equilibrium among the plasma elec-

FIG. 1: Number of VUV photons (~ω = 12.7 eV) absorbed
per atom via inverse bremsstrahlung, plotted as a function of
time. All atoms within the cluster are assumed to be singly
ionized prior to the laser pulse. The average initial kinetic
energy of a plasma electron is 0.01 hartree. The laser pulse,
having a peak intensity of 7.3 × 1013 W/cm2, is Gaussian.
It is centered at t = 0; its FWHM is 100 fs. If the electrons
are scattered by simple (Debye-screened) Coulomb potentials,
only one photon per atom is absorbed from the laser ﬁeld.
About 30 photons are absorbed, however, if a more realistic
atomic scattering potential is taken.

trons is maintained. Finally, the plasma electrons are
assumed to form a nondegenerate gas, and at each point
in time all electrons experience the same laser electric
ﬁeld. Taking the thermodynamic limit and simultane-
ously utilizing the electric-dipole approximation for the
entire system is reasonable for a cluster with a radius of
100 ˚A or so, comprising many thousands of atoms.

Let all atoms in the cluster be singly ionized (we treat
the combined eﬀect of photoionization and IBS later),
and let the atomic density be that of liquid xenon. To
a ﬁrst approximation, the plasma electrons are scat-
tered by point-like ions of charge +1. Additionally, the
plasma electrons can screen the ionic ﬁeld. Using a
Debye-shielded Coulomb potential [20], we calculated the
number of VUV photons absorbed per atom via IBS, a
plasma electron having an average initial kinetic energy
of 0.01 hartree. (Screening due to ions as well as ionic
motion during the laser pulse are neglected throughout.)
The result, as a function of time, is shown in Fig. 1.
Our data are based on a Gaussian laser pulse, centered
at t = 0 with a FWHM of 100 fs. The peak inten-
sity is 7.3 × 1013 W/cm2. After the pulse is over, each
plasma electron has absorbed only a single photon, which
is clearly in disagreement with experiment, but analogous
to the estimate quoted in Ref. [5].

The problem is the ionic scattering potential. In the
dense plasma, the electrons experience more than just a

2

simple Coulomb ﬁeld. A more realistic treatment of the
atomic potential is needed. We use the form

Vi(r) = −

{i + [Z − i] exp (−αir)} exp (−r/λD),

(1)

r

where i is the ionic charge state, Z = 54 the nuclear
charge, and λD the Debye length. The parameter αi
controls the transition from the exterior of the ion to its
interior, where a colliding electron experiences an eﬀec-
tive charge higher than i. We adjust α1 in such a way
that the binding energy of a 5p electron in the poten-
tial V1(r) (for λD → ∞) equals the ionization potential
of neutral Xe. That the resulting potential is useful for
quantitative predictions can be illustrated by calculating
the photoionization cross section: At 12.7 eV, we ﬁnd
(Both the
agreement with experiment to within 10%.
binding energy and the photoionization cross section are
calculated by numerically diagonalizing the one-electron
Hamiltonian based on V1(r).) If we now suppose that a
plasma electron scattered by Xe+ experiences the same
potential, V1(r), then the number of absorbed VUV pho-
tons per atom turns out to be about 30. This is illus-
trated in Fig. 1. The mechanism of IBS is, thus, indeed
capable of explaining the huge amount of VUV laser en-
ergy deposited in a large xenon cluster.

ionization thresholds, our treatment is not restricted to
single photoionization. We formulate a set of coupled
rate equations for the time-dependent probabilities ni(t)
(i ≥ 0) of ﬁnding Xei+ in the cluster:

˙n0(t) = −σ1(t)jph(t)n0(t)
˙n1(t) = σ1(t)jph(t)n0(t) − σ2(t)jph(t)n1(t)

(2)

...

Here, jph(t) is the photon ﬂux. These rate equations
require knowledge of the photoionization cross sections
σi+1(t) of the Xei+ species embedded in the Debye
plasma. Taking the double [21], triple [22], and quadru-
ple [23] ionization thresholds from the literature, we can
determine, in addition and in analogy to α1, the parame-
ters α2, α3, and α4 (see Eq. (1)). (In so doing, we imply
that the various 5p levels have—at least approximately—
the same energy.) With this information, the photoion-
ization cross sections of Xe, Xe+, Xe++, and Xe3+ can
be calculated as a function of time. Note that the Debye
length in Eq. (1) is time-dependent, for it is a function
of the temperature and density of the plasma electrons.
The rate equations governing the populations ni(t) are
complemented by a rate equation that describes heating
of the plasma electrons:

˙Ekin(t) =

q(t) ˙T (t) + X

εi(t)σi(t)jph(t)ni−1(t),

(3)

where q(t) is the average number of plasma electrons per
atom, T(t) the electron temperature (in units of energy),
and Ekin(t) = 3
2 q(t)T (t). εi(t) denotes the kinetic energy
of a photoelectron leaving Xei+ behind. Two contribu-
tions are taken into account in Eq. (3): the collisional
heating rate due to IBS ( ˙T (t)) and the kinetic energy
of photoelectrons newly added to the plasma. This rate
equation also depends on the neutral and ionic popula-
tions as well as the respective photoionization cross sec-
tions.

Starting with a cluster of neutral atoms in their ground
state, we numerically integrate the entire set of coupled
rate equations (Eqs. (2) and (3)). For laser pulse param-
eters identical to the ones employed for Fig. 1, the prob-
abilities ni(t) shown in Fig. 2 are obtained. As expected,
the neutral population is completely depleted after just
10 fs or so. It is more interesting to observe that singly
ionized xenon also vanishes on the same timescale. Due
to plasma screening, the production of Xe++ becomes
energetically accessible. Higher ionic charge states, how-
ever, cannot be generated by direct photoionization.

According to Fig. 2, all xenon atoms are doubly ionized
before the laser pulse even reaches its maximum. There-
fore, each atom contributes two electrons to the plasma,
which results in enhanced energy absorption: Almost 70
photons per atom are taken from the VUV laser ﬁeld at
a peak intensity of 7.3 × 1013 W/cm2, as can be seen in
Fig. 3. Also shown in that ﬁgure are the corresponding

FIG. 3: Number of VUV photons absorbed per atom via in-
verse bremsstrahlung, plotted as a function of peak pulse in-
tensity. In the underlying calculations, coupled rate equations
for the neutral and ionic populations as well as for the tem-
perature of the plasma electrons are numerically integrated.
Initially, all atoms are in their neutral ground state. The
range of intensities shown was explored in the recent cluster
experiment at the TESLA Test Facility in Hamburg [5]. The

data for lower laser intensities. Clearly, reduced inten-
sities lead to a smaller number of plasma electrons and
to less collisional heating. On the log–log scale of Fig. 3,
the eﬀect may appear to be dramatic. However, the re-
lationship between the number of absorbed photons and
the peak intensity of the laser pulse is really a linear one.
The solid line in Fig. 3 represents a linear ﬁt to the data.
There is no optical nonlinearity involved. In fact, our
model of photoionization and IBS does not contain true
multiphoton physics. Nevertheless, at high intensity,
many photons are absorbed by each plasma electron. But
this does not happen in a single step. Each plasma elec-
tron is scattered many times and can absorb only a single
photon during a collision with an ion.

Up to this point, we have ignored collisional ionization.
This eﬀect can be incorporated a posteriori by noticing
that electron–ion collisions facilitate a thermal equilib-
rium among the plasma electrons and the ions. Thus,
the electron gas is cooled, and energy is transferred to
the ions. In order to quantify this picture, the ﬁrst eight
ionization potentials of xenon are needed. To this end,
we made use of the complete-active-space self-consistent-
ﬁeld code implemented in the ab initio package MOLPRO
[24, 25] and of the eﬀective core potential by LaJohn et
al. [26]. Our ﬁrst four ionization potentials are in agree-
ment with experiment [7, 21, 22, 23] at a level of a few
percent. We assign a similar accuracy to our calculation
of the energies required to turn a neutral xenon atom into
even more highly charged ions: 156 eV for Xe5+, 220 eV

(It
is justiﬁed to use unscreened ionization potentials at the
end of the laser pulse, in view of the fact that at high
intensities the electron kinetic energies are rather high
and at low intensities there are just a few electrons that
could contribute to shielding.)

From the solution of our coupled rate equations, we
determine the total laser energy stored in the electrons
and ions. This energy is then redistributed assuming: a
Boltzmann distribution for the ionic charge states; ther-
mal kinetic energies for electrons and ions; the existence
of a common temperature. A statistical weight is in-
troduced for each ionic charge state by simply counting

tributed over the 5p spin orbitals (Xe,
5s level being doubly occupied) or over the 5s spin or-
bitals (Xe6+, Xe7+). A single state is assigned to Xe8+.
(Other electronic states of the Xei+ are neglected.) The
ionic populations resulting from this procedure are plot-
ted in Fig. 4, together with experimental data taken from
Ref. [5]. Considering the simplicity of our approach, it
is amazing how well the experimental Xei+ populations
for various laser intensities can be reproduced. We learn
from Fig. 4 that the experimental signal, obtained after
fragmentation of the clusters, basically reﬂects the ther-
mal ionic distribution in the plasma.

In this Letter, we have demonstrated that some of
the concepts familiar from low-frequency laser–cluster
physics can be transferred to higher photon energies.
However, this transfer requires a more detailed de-
scription of atoms in plasmas than previously antici-
pated. Similar care is therefore necessary when evalu-
ating the potential of future x-ray lasers for imaging of
single molecules [27]. If not all physically relevant pro-
cesses are taken into account, for example interatomic
electron-correlation phenomena following core-hole relax-
ation [28], then the degree of damage caused in a large
biomolecule, for instance, can be easily underestimated.
We believe that the theoretical description presented
here provides insight into the nature of intense laser–
cluster interactions at VUV wavelengths. Yet we an-
ticipate that, in this new laser regime of higher photon
energies, many more surprises are likely to emerge.

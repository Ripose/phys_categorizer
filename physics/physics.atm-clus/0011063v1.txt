Abstract

We study the thermodynamics of Na8 and Na20 clusters using
multiple-histogram methods and an ab initio treatment of the valence
electrons within density functional theory. We consider the inﬂuence
of various electron kinetic-energy functionals and pseudopotentials on
the canonical ionic speciﬁc heats. The results for all models we con-
sider show qualitative similarities, but also signiﬁcant temperature
shifts from model to model of peaks and other features in the speciﬁc-
heat curves. The use of phenomenological pseudopotentials shifts the
melting peak substantially (∼ 50–100 K) when compared to ab ini-
tio results.
It is argued that the choice of a good pseudopotential
and use of better electronic kinetic-energy functionals has the poten-
tial for performing large time scale and large sized thermodynamical
simulations on clusters.

1 Introduction

The physics of ﬁnite-sized systems such as clusters continues to invoke consid-
erable interest both in theory and experiment. A particularly intriguing and
poorly understood phenomenon is the melting behavior of such ﬁnite-sized
systems. Only recently have Haberland et al.[1] succeeded in measuring the

1

heat capacity of free (i.e. unsupported) Na+
n clusters, with n ranging from 70
to 200 atoms. Interestingly, they ﬁnd a nonmonotonic behavior of the melt-
ing temperature as a function of cluster size, with pronounced maxima at
n = 57 and 142. These sizes correspond neither to closed-shell Mackay icosa-
hedra (n = 55 and 147) nor to closed shells of valence electrons (n = 59 and
139), but are intermediate between the two. This clearly indicates that both
geometric and electronic shell eﬀects contribute to the melting phenomenon
in a rather subtle manner.

Prior to this measurement, there have been a few experimental studies on
melting of clusters. Martin et al.[2] reported measurements on the melting
temperature of Na clusters for the sizes of the order of thousands of atoms
and their results indicated that the melting temperatures increased with size,
but had not reached the experimental bulk value. Peters et al.[3] have noted
the existence of surface melting on supported Pb nanoparticles using X-Ray
diﬀraction.

Clearly, the melting behavior at small sizes is cluster speciﬁc and dependent
on the nature of the electronic structure and geometry. Further, the transi-
tion found by Haberland et al.[1] is not sharp and has a broadened peak in
the speciﬁc heat with a width of approximately 40 K. The expected mono-
tonic increase of melting point has been seen only for very large clusters con-
taining upwards of several thousand atoms. On the theoretical side, much
insight into the ﬁnite-temperature properties has been gained via molecu-
lar dynamics (MD) and Monte-Carlo (MC) numerical simulations. Most of
these simulations have been carried out using classical empirical two-body
potential functions, [4] mostly of Lennard-Jones (LJ) or Morse type. These
studies have revealed that small clusters exhibit a melting transition over a
broad temperature range, unlike bulk systems, and have broad heat-capacity
curves. In addition, they also exhibit a variety of other phenomena such as
isomerization (including surface isomerization) and surface melting, which
are generically referred to as “premelting” phenomena. Some clusters also
exhibit coexistence of liquid-like and solid-like phases within the melting
temperature range.

MD and MC simulations have also been reported using classical embedded-
atom potentials, such as the single-moment approximation (SMA), [5, 6]
which contain approximations to the N-body forces found in metallic sys-

2

tems like Na clusters. Calvo and Spiegelmann [7, 8] performed extensive
simulations on Na clusters with from 8 to 147 atoms using the SMA poten-
tial of Li et al.
[6] with a view to probe the melting phenomena of small
Na clusters. They ﬁnd that premelting phenomena dominate the melting
process at small cluster sizes (n < 75), while the larger sizes exhibit a pref-
erence for a single-process melting. They also observe that the nature of the
ground state is critical to the thermodynamics of the cluster. However, as
they clearly point out, their simulations do not incorporate the electronic
structure eﬀects directly.
An alternative approach for metallic clusters is that of Poteau et al.
[9, 10]
who developed a tight-binding Hamiltonian to incorporate quantal eﬀects
approximately. They use a H¨uckel-type Hamiltonian and MC to sample the
phase space for small Na clusters with 4, 8, and 20 atoms. Calvo and Spiegel-
mann [8] have performed more extensive calculations for sizes up to 147 atoms
with the same potential. However, during the last decade developments in ab
initio methods have opened up practical possibilities of performing accurate
simulations by combining density functional theory (DFT) with classical MD
or MC. The most accurate form of DFT is the Kohn-Sham (KS) formulation.
Although these methods have been used to investigate the structural prop-
erties with remarkable success, relatively few applications of such ab initio
methods have been to the simulation of melting. Jellinek et al.[11] have,
however, combined a hybrid Hartree-Fock/DFT method with MC sampling
to study the thermodynamics of Li8.

Although it is most desirable to have a full quantum mechanical treatment
of electrons, as in the KS method, such simulations turn out to be expensive.
It is also to be noted that typical simulation times used in purely empirical
potential MD are of the order of a few 100 ps or more per energy point.
Considering that the most relevant sizes for the experiment are in excess
of 50 atoms, the full ab initio simulation may turn out to be practically
too expensive.[12] Hence approximate methods leading to practical and fast
algorithms have been developed. One such technique is density-based (DB)
molecular dynamics, where the electronic kinetic energy is approximated as a
functional of density only. For example, Vichare and Kanhere [13] performed
ab initio simulations on an Al13 cluster to investigate its melting behavior.
The DB method has also been used by Aguado et al.[14, 15] to study the
melting of Na clusters ranging in size from 8 to 142 atoms. Their simulations

3

are of constant total energy type using empirical pseudopotentials with up
to 50 ps of observation time per energy point for small clusters (8 and 20
atoms), and up to 18 ps per energy point for larger ones. Another approach
is that of Blaise et al. [16] who carried out DB simulations for Na clusters up
to size 274, but using soft, phenomenological pseudopotentials rather than
ab initio pseudopotentials.
In addition to permitting signiﬁcantly longer
observation times, these soft pseudopotentials were shown to reproduce well
properties such as the volume and surface energies, ionization energies, and
the frequency of collective ionic monopole and quadrupole oscillations.

These above-mentioned studies on Na clusters bring out a number of issues
which need further investigation. Clearly, it is desirable to have both long
simulation times and a full quantum mechanical treatment of electrons. Full
KS being expensive, however, the attractive propositions of DB or soft pseu-
dopotentials as practical alternatives for the simulation of such systems need
to be assessed as to their quality. This is particularly important because of
some discrepancies seen in the above studies. For example, in the case of
Na8, Calvo and Spiegelmann, [7, 8] using an SMA potential, ﬁnd that the
canonical speciﬁc heat is broad in nature and shows a ﬂattened peak between
about 110 K to 250 K. For the same cluster, the tight-binding potential [8, 9]
leads to a less broad peak, with a width of about 70 K and peaking at 160
K. However, the microcanonical speciﬁc heat obtained by Aguado et al.[14]
for Na8 in a constant-energy DB study shows a peak at a much lower value
of 110 K and is sharp with a width of less than 30 K. This is in qualitative
disagreement with the SMA and tight-binding results.

Further, there is a diﬀerence in the way the data has been analyzed by these
workers. Aguado et al.[14, 15] have used the traditional trajectory-based
analysis, which uses the caloric curve supplemented by Lindemann type cri-
teria for identifying the transition. Since the transition is never sharp, such
an analysis may not lead to an unambiguous determination of the melting
temperature. In addition, the observation times of Aguado et al.are signif-
icantly less than those used by Calvo and Spiegelmann [7, 8] in their SMA
or tight-binding work. In fact, it is desirable to calculate appropriate ther-
modynamic indicators such as the ionic entropy and the speciﬁc heat.
In
Refs. [7, 8, 9], the authors have used the multiple histogram (MH) technique
[17, 18] to extract the entropy and the speciﬁc heat from the simulation data,
as we do here.

4

In the present work, we therefore examine the melting of Na8 and Na20 clus-
ters with a view to resolving these issues. We have carried out the follow-
ing simulations on Na8: a full KS (orbital-based) simulation using ab initio
pseudopotentials; a DB simulation, where the electronic kinetic energy is ap-
proximated, but with identical pseudopotential and time scales; and both KS
and DB simulations with soft pseudopotentials. The same simulations have
been carried out for Na20, with the exception of the full KS simulation with
ab initio pseudopotentials. In all the cases we have calculated the entropy
and the canonical speciﬁc heat via the MH method, as well as the tradi-
tional indicators like the RMS bond length ﬂuctuation and mean squared
displacements.

In the next section, we brieﬂy describe the formalism, analysis methods, and
numerical details. In Section 3, we present our results and discuss them in
the light of earlier studies. Finally, our conclusions are presented in Section
4.

2 Method

Following the usual procedure in DFT,[19] we write the total energy of a
system of Na stationary Na+ ions with coordinates R ≡ {Ri} and Ne valence
electrons as a functional of the electron density ρ ≡ ρ(r)

Epot[ρ, R] = T [ρ] + Eext[ρ, R] + EH [ρ] + Exc[ρ] + Eii[R] ,

(1)

where T [ρ] and EH [ρ] are the kinetic and Hartree energy, respectively, of the
valence electrons, Eext[ρ, R] is the interaction energy of the valence electrons
with the ions, evaluated using the pseudopotential formalism, Exc[ρ] is the
electron exchange-correlation energy in the local density approximation (us-
ing the parametrization of Perdew and Zunger[20]), and Eii[R] is the ion-ion
interaction energy. In the standard KS approach, T [ρ] is expressed as a sum
of expectation values, over each KS orbital, of the electron kinetic-energy
operator −(1/2)∇2. In contrast, in the DB approach T [ρ] is expressed as a
functional of ρ only, without introducing orbitals, leading to a faster though
in practice less accurate calculational scheme. For each approach we use
either ab initio (AI) pseudopotentials or soft, phenomenological (SP) pseud-
potentials. We consider two forms for T [ρ] in the DB approach: in our DB-AI

5

approach we use a functional form proposed for clusters,[21, 22] while in our
DB-SP approach we take T [ρ] as a sum of the Thomas-Fermi energy and a
scaled Weizs¨acker term. [16]
The ab initio pseudopotentials used in the KS-AI and DB-AI approaches are
those proposed by Bachelet, Hamann and Schl¨uter.[23] The soft, phenomeno-
logical pseudopotential used in the KS-SP and DB-SP approaches is given
by [16]

for a single Na+ ion at the origin, where rc = 3.55a0 in the DB-SP approach
and rc = 3.7a0 in the KS-SP approach. The choice of rc for the DB-SP
approach follows from a ﬁt to volume and surface energies,[16] while for the
KS-SP approach the choice of rc ensures close agreement with ionization
energies and dissociation energies given by an ab initio pseudopotential, for
small clusters in the size range n = 3 to 8. Use of the phenomenological
pseudopotential permits a larger grid step size or equivalently a smaller plane-
wave energy cut-oﬀ, thus leading to a faster solution in either the KS or DB
formalisms. The Car-Parinello (CP) algorithm [24] was used in the DB-AI
and DB-SP schemes, while the damping scheme proposed by Joanopoulous
et al. [25] was used to minimise the electronic degrees of freedom in KS-AI.

The trajectories collected were analyzed using traditional indicators of melt-
ing like the rms bond-length ﬂuctuation, deﬁned as

where rij is the distance between ions i and j, and h. . .it denotes a time
average. According to the Lindemann criterion, a system may no longer be
considered to be solid if δrms is greater than 0.1 to 0.15. Short time averages
over the trajectory data, e.g. over data points corresponding to 1 ps, 2 ps, 5
ps, etc., were evaluated to obtain the dependence of δrms on the duration of
the time average. Another indicator we have used is the mean square ionic
displacement, deﬁned as

We have set the total number of time-steps nt used in the time average to
nt = nT /2, where nT is the total simulation time (usually about 50 ps).

A more complete thermodynamic analysis of the simulations is possible us-
ing the multiple histogram method (MH),[17, 18] and all simulations were
analysed using this method.
It requires the conﬁgurational energy, which
corresponds here to the classical potential energy Epot[ρ, R] of Eq. (1), over
various points in the ionic phase space accessed by the system along the tra-
jectory. This is used to evaluate the classical ionic density of states Ω(E), and
thereby the ionic entropy S(E) = ln Ω(E), as well as the partition function
via a least-squares ﬁtting procedure. The sampled values of the conﬁgura-
tional energy are ﬁtted to the theoretical probability distribution and the
ﬁtted coeﬃcients are then used to evaluate the various thermodynamic func-
tions. We consider in particular the canonical speciﬁc heat, deﬁned as usual
by

C =

∂U
∂T

,

where U = hEpot + EkiniT is the average total internal energy in a canonical
ensemble at temperature T . We here exclude the contribution of the center-
of-mass motion to the ion kinetic energy Ekin, so that from the equipartition
theorem

hEkiniT =

(Na − 1)kBT .

with Ω(E) the classical density of states extracted from the MH ﬁt, and
Z(T ) the normalizing canonical partition function. Note that although here
we shall discuss results in the canonical ensemble, once Ω(E) is known, one
may also evaluate properties in the microcanonical ensemble, such as the
microcanonical temperature T (E)

ground-state geometry is found to have a dodecahedral D2d symmetry in both
the KS and DB formalisms and for both the AI and SP pseudopotentials,
in agreement with the structure found by R¨othlisberger and Andreoni [26]
in a KS approach. For Na20 in the DB formalism, we ﬁnd a ground state
consisting of a double icosahedron with a single cap on its waist, which is
the second of the two structures found in Ref. [26]. In the KS formalism, the
ground state for Na20 is a double icosahedron missing one end cap and with
two caps on the waist, in agreement with Ref. [26]. Our DB structures agree
with those found by Aguado et. al.[14]

We have considered two approaches to the statistical sampling of the ionic
phase space, required as input to the MH analysis.
In each approach the
clusters are eﬀectively heated slowly from the ground-state structure at 0 K to
a liquid-like state at upwards of 250 K. The ﬁrst approach involves a canonical
sampling of the phase space and was used with the AI pseudopotentials in
both the KS and DB schemes. Successive simulation temperatures of 60 K,
80 K, 100 K, 125 K, 150 K, 175 K, 200 K, 225 K, and 250 K were chosen. Each
temperature was maintained within ±10 K using velocity scaling,[30] except
for the 60 K and 80 K temperatures, where the temperatures were maintained
within ±5 K. The total observation time for both KS and DB is about 57.5 ps
per temperature point. The initial condition at each temperature was taken
as the ﬁnal state of the previous temperature, and the initial 1.25 ps of
simulation time were used to raise the previous temperature. The next 5 ps
were then discarded to allow for thermalization of the system at the new
temperature. The analysis was performed on the data corresponding to the
last ∼ 50 ps. The simulations for the clusters Na8 and Na20 were performed
within a cubical supercell of edge 40 a.u. [27] or more. All Fourier space
evaluations were carried out on a mesh of 64×64×64 for DB and 48×48×48
for KS with a cutoﬀ of about 21 Ry. The conﬁguration energy range was
divided into bins whose width was chosen to give at least about 30 points
for the lowest temperature distribution. About 500 bins were typically used
to cover the entire conﬁguration energy range. The canonical speciﬁc heats
obtained using the MH analysis were then plotted as a multiple of their
value C0 at 0 K given by C0 = (3Na − 9/2)kB, which is the zero-temperature
classical limit of the rotational plus vibrational speciﬁc heats.

Our second approach consists of a microcanonical sampling of the phase
space, and was used with the SP pseudopotential in both the KS and DB

8

schemes. Constant total energy simulations were performed at closely spaced
values of the total energy, such as to give good overlap of successive his-
tograms of the potential energy Epot. The simulations were performed in
order of increasing total energy, with the initial condition at one energy ob-
tained by scaling the velocities of the ﬁnal state of the previous energy, and
20–30 energy points were used to scan the required energy range. Each en-
ergy point consisted of from 50–100 ps of observation time, of which 5–10 ps
were discarded for equilibration. Several scans of the entire energy range
were made in this way, giving total simulation times of about 15 ns for (Na8,
DB-SP), 5 ns for (Na8, KS-SP), 6 ns for (Na20, DB-SP), and 3 ns for (Na20,
KS-SP). The microcanonical sampling requires a modiﬁed MH analysis.[28]
Note that DB-SP results have been reported elsewhere,[29] and are repro-
duced here for purposes of comparison.

The dominant error in our speciﬁc-heat curves is statistical, due to the ﬁnite
duration of the sampling of the phase space. By adding extra data points,
or complete additional scans of the whole temperature range, to the MH
analysis, we ﬁnd the speciﬁc-heat curves to be stable to about 10% or better,
and the positions of peaks to be stable to about ±20 K or better. We take
this as an informal estimate of the statistical error. However, in dynamical
simulations such as these, it may be that some processes of importance (e.g.
isomerizations) occur on a physical time scale rather longer than we have
considered, so that we have imperfect ergodicity; all we can say is that our
curves do appear to be rather stable on the time scales that we have con-
sidered. We are currently considering recent Monte-Carlo sampling methods
such as the parallel tempering method,[31] which are designed to overcome
the problem of long time scales and improve ergodicity.

3 Results

We begin the discussion by considering some of the conventional trajectory-
based indicators of isomerization and melting. In Fig. 1, we show the rms
bond-length ﬂuctuations δrms of Na8 in the KS-AI model as a function of
simulation time, for diﬀerent temperatures in the range 60 K to 250 K. The
ﬁgure makes it clear that for temperatures up to about T = 200 K, 25 ps

9

are suﬃcient to converge the value of δrms, while for higher temperatures of
the order of 250 K or more, even longer simulation times may be required.
Similar behaviour is seen in Fig. 2 for the 20-atom cluster simulated within
the DB-AI model. In Fig. 3, we show δrms averaged over 37.5 ps and over
5 ps, as a function of temperature. Note that the 5 ps curve never crosses the
Lindemann criterion of 0.1, while the 37.5 ps curve crosses the Lindemann
criterion of 0.1 around 190 K. The behavior of δrms in DB-AI over identical
simulation times is very similar.

The mean square ionic displacement hr2(t)i (4) has also often been used as
In
an indicator of isomerization or of a solid-like to liquid-like transition.
Figs. 4 and 5 we show hr2(t)i on diﬀerent time scales of 1 ps and 25 ps,
respectively, for Na8 in the KS-AI model. One observes that hr2(t)i at low
temperatures T < 100 K reaches a horizontal plateau for t>∼ 0.25 ps, indica-
tive of a solid-like behavior in which atoms vibrate around ﬁxed points with
an amplitude squared that increases in rough proportion to the temperature.
On the other hand, the rising curve for T ≥ 250 K suggests a liquid-like
behavior with diﬀusion throughout the entire volume of the cluster. The
curve for T ≥ 250 K would eventually reach a plateau with a hr2(t)i value
characteristic of the square of the linear dimension of the cluster, but even
at t = 25 ps this plateau has not yet been attained. Somewhere between
these two limiting temperatures is a region of isomerization processes with a
character intermediate, in some sense, between solid and liquid.

The MH analysis may be used to probe further the thermodynamics of
the cluster in any particular model. One here extracts the ionic entropy
S(E) = ln Ω(E), which is a functional of the potential-energy surface (1). As
expected, all entropy curves show a monotonic increase, the curve for KS-AI,
shown in Fig. 6, being typical. The canonical speciﬁc heats (5) for Na8 ob-
tained via the MH technique for all four models are shown in Figs. 7–10. In
general, all the Na8 speciﬁc-heat curves show broad peaks with widths over
100 K. The initial rise is around 70 K for both DB models. In the KS models,
the initial rise of the main peak for the SP pseudopotential is at a higher
temperature than for the AI pseudopotential, namely, at 200 K compared to
150 K. However, the KS-SP model has a shoulder feature around 80 K not
visible in the KS-AI results. Turning to Na20 in Figs. 11–13, we ﬁnd main
peaks that are less broad than for Na8, with a width generally somewhat less
than 100 K. In the DB models, the main peak for the AI pseudopotential is

10

at a higher temperature than for the SP pseudopotential, namely, at about
250 K compared to about 150 K. If on the other hand we compare the KS-
SP model with the DB-SP model, we ﬁnd that both main peaks occur at
about the same temperature. However, the KS-SP model has a “premelting”
feature around 80 K that is more distinct than for DB-SP model.

It is diﬃcult to draw simple, general conclusions from these observations
concerning the eﬀect of the KS approach versus the DB approach, or the
eﬀect of AI versus SP pseudopotentials. For example, for Na8 in the KS
model, the SP pseudopotential gives a main peak at higher a temperature
than for the AI pseudopotential (if one ignores the small premelting feature
in the former), while for Na20 in the DB model, it is the AI pseudopotential
that gives a peak at the higher temperature. For these small cluster sizes,
the precise form of the speciﬁc-heat curves can evidently be very sensitive
to the model used. One observes a similarly large variation in speciﬁc-heat
curves between the SMA and TB models reported in Ref. [8]. Evidently, the
important features of the potential-energy landscape can be rather sensitive
to the model employed.

Some insight into the model-dependence of the potential-energy surface may
be gained from the energetic ordering of a selection of possible isomers of
Na8. We consider the dodecahedron D2d (the ground state in all DB and KS
models of this work, as well as in the SMA model [7]), the capped pentagonal
bipyramid Cs (the ground state for LJ8), and the stellated tetrahedron Td.
In the DB models and the SMA model, the Cs structure forms a relatively
low-lying excited isomer at 0.03–0.05 eV above the D2d ground state, while
in our KS models and in the KS approach of Ref. [26], the Cs structure is
unstable and collapses to D2d upon relaxation. On the other hand, the Td
structure forms a higher-lying isomer at around 0.09–0.12 eV in the present
DB and KS models, in the KS approach of Ref. [26], and in the SMA model,
while in the TB model [8] and in an all-electron conﬁguration-interaction
approach,[32] the Td structure is the ground state. This illustrates how even
for Na8 the ordering of isomers given by ab initio calculations is uncertain.
We note that, while the heights of the barriers separating isomers are a
more important determining factor than the simple energy diﬀerences, the
existence of the low-lying Cs isomer in the DB models, but not in the KS
models, is consistent with the lower-temperature shoulder of the Na8 speciﬁc
heat curve in the DB models.

11

Our speciﬁc-heat curves are in general qualitatively quite similar to those for
the SMA potential:[7, 8] Na8 in the SMA model has a broad peak, and Na20 a
rather narrower peak with a small premelting feature on the low-temperature
side. On the other hand, there are some diﬀerences with the TB speciﬁc-
heat curves.[8] For instance, the speciﬁc heat of Na8 has a somewhat narrower
peak in the TB model than in the DB, KS, or SMA models. However, as
noted above, the ground-state structure of Na8 has a Td symmetry in the
TB model, but a D2d symmetry in the DB, KS, and SMA models. Finally,
Aguado et. al., [14] using a model quite similar to the present DB-AI model,
give microcanonical speciﬁc heats for Na8 and Na20, derived from a trajectory-
based analysis, that appear to disagree qualitatively with the present DB and
KS results (and with the SMA results.[7, 8]) Their curve for Na8 has a single
narrow peak with a width less than 30 K located around 110 K, while their
curve for Na20 has two distinct peaks, each with a width less than 30 K and of
similar height, located at about 110 K and 170 K. The precise reason for the
diﬀerences between their results and the present results is unclear at present
and requires further investigation. A re-evaluation of our own results in the
microcanonical ensemble shows that the change of ensemble is insuﬃcient to
explain these diﬀerences, and we note that our DB ground-state geometries
agree with theirs. Given the similarity between their DB model and ours,
in the
the discrepancies may be due simply to methodological diﬀerences:
present work we have derived the speciﬁc-heat curves from a MH analysis,
and have used longer sampling runs, checking that the speciﬁc-heat curves
are reasonably stable against the addition of further data.

4 Conclusions

We have investigated the thermodynamics and melting of the small clusters
Na8 and Na20 using interionic potentials derived from several DFT models
for the valence electrons. The data have been analyzed using a MH analy-
sis, which is an eﬃcient and reliable way of probing the melting transition.
Of the various DFT models, the most accurate one considered here should
be the KS-AI model. The other models involve substituting less accurate
electron kinetic-energy functionals T [ρ] (the DB approaches), or else soft,
phenomenological pseudopotentials (the SP approaches) in place of ab initio

12

pseudopotentials, in each case with a view to accelerating the calculation and
permitting better statistics. While there are qualitative similarities between
the curves obtained from the various models, we also observe substantial
shifts in temperatures of the main peaks and other features of the curves
from model to model.

Concerning the choice of pseudopotential, while the SP pseudopotential is
known to predict ground-state geometries and certain other properties well,
as mentioned previously, it does not necessarily follow that energetic bar-
riers and other important features of the potential-energy surface are well
described. Given the substantial diﬀerences in the speciﬁc-heat curves ob-
tained from the SP and AI pseudopotentials, it would therefore seem wise
to prefer AI pseudopotentials. Note, however, that the soft pseudopoten-
tial used here is highly phenomenological: it lacks entirely a repulsive core,
and deviates from the asymptotic value −1/r for r<∼ 3.7 a0, which is well
outside the physical core of the Na+ ion, r<∼ 2.0 a0. It may be possible to
construct a better soft pseudopotential that minimizes the diﬀerence with
the speciﬁc-heat curve obtained from an AI pseudopotential and yet still
yields a signiﬁcantly cheaper calculation, thus permitting a very useful gain
in statistics in thermodynamic simulations. We are currently investigating
such possibilities.

As to the DB approach versus the full KS approach, we note that one impor-
tant approximation in the DB approach in its present form is its diﬃculty in
accounting for quantum shell eﬀects accurately. The two DB forms for T [ρ]
considered here yield energies that vary smoothly with cluster size N accord-
ing to a liquid-drop formula (as shown explicitly in Ref. [16] for the extended
Thomas-Fermi functional), without showing the ﬂuctuations in energy asso-
ciated with quantum shell closures of the valence electrons. Further, while
ground-state geometries and other properties of closed-shell systems can be
predicted rather successfully by the DB approach [16, 22], it has trouble
reproducing Jahn-Teller distortions in open-shell systems. Now, according
to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems, it should in principle be possible to ﬁnd
a DB functional T [ρ] that fully incorporates such quantum shell eﬀects in
ﬁnite systems. It appears that if the DB methods are to yield reliable, quan-
titative information, then better electronic kinetic-energy functionals along
these lines are required. Fortunately, signiﬁcant progress is being made in
this direction, and a number of researchers have already proposed DB kinetic-

13

energy functionals incorporating electronic shell eﬀects approximately.

There is a special reason for paying careful attention to electronic shell eﬀects
in studies of melting that was mentioned earlier, related to the experiments of
Haberland et al. [1]. The fact that prominent maxima in the melting point
occur for sizes that are intermediate between geometric shell closures and
electronic shell closures suggests that there is an important interplay between
geometric eﬀects and quantum shell eﬀects. To understand this phenomenon
more closely, we are currently considering Monte-Carlo sampling methods
combined with various approximate KS schemes, with a view to extending
the KS calculations presented in this work to larger sizes, within the range
of the Haberland et al. data.

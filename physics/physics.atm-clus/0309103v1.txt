The He2-SF6 trimers, in their diﬀerent He isotopic combinations, are studied both in the frame-
work of the correlated Jastrow approach and of the Correlated Hyperspherical Harmonics expansion
method. The energetics and structure of the He-SF6 dimers are analyzed, and the existence of a
characteristic rotational band in the excitation spectrum is discussed, as well as the isotopic diﬀer-
ences. The binding energies and the spatial properties of the trimers, in their ground and lowest
lying excited states, obtained by the Jastrow ansatz are in excellent agreement with the results of
the converged CHH expansion. The introduction of the He-He correlation makes all trimers bound
by largely suppressing the short range He-He repulsion. The structural properties of the trimers are
qualitatively explained in terms of the shape of the interactions, Pauli principle and masses of the
constituents.

INTRODUCTION

Helium systems are dominated by quantum eﬀects and remain liquid down to zero temperature. This is a conse-
quence of both the small atomic mass and the weak atom-atom interaction, which is the weakest among the rare gas
atoms. Helium clusters remain liquid under all conditions of formation and are very weakly bound systems.

Small helium clusters have been detected by diﬀraction of a helium nozzle beam by a transmission grating.1 Using a
grating of 200 nm period, conclusive evidence of the existence of the dimer 4He2 has been established.2 The existence
of 4He2 was previously reported3 using electron impact ionization techniques. Diﬀraction experiments from a 100
4 ˚A, out of which a binding
nm period grating has lead to the determination of a molecular bond length of 54
0.2 mK has been deduced.4 This energy is in good agreement with the values obtained by direct
energy of 1.1 + 0.3
integration of the Schr¨odinger equation using modern He-He interactions.5 Theoretical calculations indicate that any
number of 4He atoms form a self-bound system. In contrast, a substantially larger number of 3He atoms is necessary
for self-binding, as a consequence of the smaller 3He atomic mass and its fermionic nature. The required minimum
number has been estimated to be 29 atoms, using a density functional plus conﬁguration interaction techniques to
solve the many-body problem,6 or 34-35 atoms, using an accurate variational wave function7,8 with the HFD-B(HE)
Aziz interaction.9 It is worth recalling that a theoretical description of pure 3He clusters, either based on ab initio
calculations or employing Green Function or Diﬀusion Monte Carlo techniques, is still missing.

Doping a helium cluster with atomic or molecular impurities constitutes a useful probe of the structural and
energetic properties of the cluster itself. It has been proved that rare gases and closed-shell molecules as HF, OCS
or SF6 are located in the bulk of the cluster.10 Doped 4He clusters have been extensively studied in the past by a
variety of methods, ranging from Diﬀusion and Path Integral Quantum Monte Carlo methods to two-ﬂuid models.
A comprehensive view of this subject is found in Ref. 11, giving account on a microscopic basis of the free rotation
of a heavy molecule in a 4He nanodroplet, consistently with the occurring bosonic superﬂuidity at the attained
temperatures. This phenomenon is not expected to take place in doped 3He clusters, because of the fermionic nature
of the atoms, unless very low temperatures (below a few mK) are reached. Even more interesting, from both the
theoretical and experimental points of view, are mixed doped clusters of 3He and 4He atoms. The status of the theory
in these last cases is far behind that in the 4He droplets. The most updated studies of 3He and mixed 4He-3He
clusters, either pure or doped, employ a ﬁnite-range density functional theory.12,13

In this work we study the properties of a trimer formed by two helium atoms plus a heavy dopant. The dopant
molecule behaves as an attractive center binding a certain number of otherwise unbound 3He atoms. This fact has
been used in Ref. 14 to set an analogy between electrons bound by an atomic nucleus and 3He atoms bound by a

2

(2)

dopant species. Systems formed by two 3He atoms plus a molecule have been studied employing the usual quantum
chemistry machinery.

Helium droplets doped with the SF6 molecule have been widely investigated, also in view of the fact that the
interaction He-SF6 is well established.15,16 In this work we use the spherically averaged interaction of Taylor and
Hurly16 between the helium atom and the SF6 molecule, and the Aziz HFD-B(HE) helium-helium interaction.9 We
ﬁrst perform a variational study of the 3He2-SF6, 4He2-SF6 and 4He-3He-SF6 trimers using a Jastrow correlated wave
function. Then the Correlated Hyperspherical Harmonics (CHH) expansion method17 is employed and its outcomes
are used as benchmarks for the variational calculations. The CHH expansion has shown to be a powerful technique
to study three-and four-body strongly interacting systems. In light atomic nuclei its accuracy is comparable with
(and in some cases even better than) other popular approaches, as the Faddeev, Faddeev-Yakubowsky and Quantum
Monte Carlo ones.18 Besides accurately studying the ground and ﬁrst excited states of the trimers, comparing the
variational and CHH results may provide essential clues for the construction of a reliable variational wave function to
be used in heavier doped nanodroplets.

The plan of this paper is the following. In Sect. II we study the dimers formed by a single helium atom and the SF6
molecule and enlighten some aspects of their excitation spectrum. In Sect. III we consider the trimers by the Jastrow
variational and CHH approaches. Results for the energetics and structure of the trimers are given and discussed in
Section IV. Finally, Sect. V provides the conclusions and the future perspectives of this work.

Prior to the study of trimers made by two helium atoms and a dopant species, it is convenient to analize the dimer
in some details. To ﬁx the notation for later discussions, we write here the Schr¨odinger equation for the relative
motion of a helium atom and a dopant, D,

with

where mα (with α = 3, 4) is the reduced mass of the αHe-D pair, and VHe−D(r) is the helium-dopant interaction,
being r the relative coordinate. We have numerically solved this equation for the dopant SF6, using the spherically
averaged interaction determined in Ref. 16. A set of energies and orbitals characterized by the quantum numbers (nℓ)
is thus obtained.

The He-SF6 interaction has an attractive well strong enough to sustain 12 and 15 bound states for isotopes 3He
and 4He, respectively. In Table I some observables of the dimers are displayed. The calculations have been done in
the limit of inﬁnite mass of the SF6 molecule. The most striking feature of the energy spectra is that the ﬁrst 7 (9)

interaction.

To ﬁrst order in the mass ratio, the correction to the inﬁnite dopant mass approximation modiﬁes the kinetic energy
M=∞(1 + mα/M ), with M the dopant mass. Accordingly, the ﬁnite mass system results less bound by
M=∞(mα/M ). The mass ratios mα/M are 0.0207 and 0.0274 for 3He and 4He, respectively, considering the

attractive beyond. The attractive part is mostly concentrated in a narrow region around 4.2 ˚A, immediately after
the repulsive core. This implies that the He atom locates relatively far away from the potential origin, so that the
centrifugal term entering the Schr¨odinger equation can be considered as a perturbation. Two consequences can be
deduced from this observation. First, the radial distributions are very peaked in the same narrow region, independently
on the value of the angular momentum ℓ, as it is shown in Fig. 1 for three states, corresponding to ℓ = 0 and 4 for both
isotopes, and the nodeless bound states with the highest excitation energy, namely ℓ = 8 for 3He and 9 for 4He. The
distributions are concentrated in the same region, and those corresponding to ℓ = 0 and 4 are barely distinguishible.
Second, the excitation energies are closely proportional to ℓ(ℓ + 1), i.e. they follow a rotational pattern. Figure 2

constants are C(3)
1 = 0.179 K. The ratio of the rotational constants of the dimers with either
isotope are of course in the inverse ratio of masses. Notice that the larger mass of the 4He atom translates into a
larger binding. Both the decrease of the kinetic energy and the increase of the attraction contribute to the increment
of the binding energy for the 4He-SF6 dimer. The stronger localization of the 4He atom is visualized by the peak of
the radial probability density shown in Fig. 1, which is slightly higher for the 4He atom.

It is worth stressing that the observed rotational spectrum is a direct consequence of the shape of the He-SF6

interaction, whose attractive well, having a depth of

the lighter Ne as a dopant, we have found that only three bound states exist, being the depth of the attractive well

III. THE HE2-SF6 TRIMERS: THEORY

In the limit of inﬁnite mass of the dopant molecule, hence considered as a ﬁxed center, the Hamiltonian of the

He2-SF6 trimers is

ri is the coordinate of the i–th helium atom with respect to the central molecule and r12 is the helium–helium relative
coordinate.

The ground and excited states properties of the trimers can be obtained either by an exact solution of the Schr¨odinger

equation,

H(1, 2) ΨT

γ (1, 2) = Eγ ΨT

γ (1, 2)

or by some approximate estimate of their wave functions. Here γ labels the generic trimer state, whose wave function
is ΨT

γ (1, 2).

The Schr¨odinger equation for clusters of 4He atoms may be exactly solved for the ground state by quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) methods.19,20,21 Other approaches, as Variational Monte Carlo22,23,24 (VMC) with Jastrow correlated
wave functions or density functional theories25,26 (DFT), provide a less accurate description of the clusters. However,
they are generally more ﬂexible than QMC.

The presence of more than two 3He atoms makes the exact solution of the Schr¨odinger equation much more
diﬃcult, because of the notorious sign problem27 associated to their fermionic nature. As a consequence, only DFT
based studies of doped 3He clusters are available in literature.12,13 The most updated study of the 3He2-SF6 trimer
has been done within the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation, not considering the strong He-He correlations induced
by VHe−He.14

In this Section we will ﬁrst present a variational approach based on a Jastrow (J) correlated wave function. Then we
will apply the Correlated Harmonical Hyperspherical (CHH) expansion method17 to further improve the description
of the doped trimers.

A. Variational approach

The Jastrow correlated wave function of the trimer for the γ–state is given by:

ΨJ

γ (1, 2) = Φγ(1, 2) fJ (r12)

(5)

where Φγ(1, 2) is an independent particle (IP) wave function of the two helium atoms in the dopant ﬁeld having the
same set, γ, of quantum numbers. The correlation function between the two atoms, fJ (r), is assumed to depend only
on the interatomic distance and takes into account the modiﬁcation to the IP wave function mainly due to the He-He
interaction. The optimal fJ (r) is variationally ﬁxed by minimizing the total energy of the state. Φγ(1, 2) is built as

an appropriate combination of the dimer He-SF6 wave functions. For instance, using the (LS)π notation (L being the
IP orbital angular momentum, S the total spin and π the parity of the helium pair), the (00)+ IP wave function for
the 3He2-SF6 trimer is taken as:

Φ(00)+ (1, 2) = Ξ0(1, 2) φ1s(r1)φ1s(r2)

where Ξ0(1, 2) is the spin-singlet wave function of the 3He-3He pair and φ1s(r) is the 1s (n=0 and ℓ=0) solution of
the 3He-SF6 dimer Schr¨odinger equation (1).

In an analogous way, the (10)− and (11)− IP wave functions are:

1
√2

1
√2

Φ(10)− (1, 2) = Ξ0(1, 2)

[φ1s(r1)φ1p(r2) + φ1p(r1)φ1s(r2)]

and

Φ(11)− (1, 2) = Ξ1(1, 2)

[φ1s(r1)φ1p(r2)

φ1p(r1)φ1s(r2)]

−

where Ξ1(1, 2) is the spin-triplet pair wave function.

The total Hamiltonian (3) can be written as:

H(1, 2) = h0(1) + h0(2) + VHe−He(r12) = H0(1, 2) + VHe−He(r12)

where h0 is the Hamiltonian (2) of the dimer, and

H0(1, 2) Φγ(1, 2) = (eγ1 + eγ2 ) Φγ(1, 2)

where the two sets of dimer quantum numbers, γ1 and γ2, are those taken to build up the total γ-trimer state.

The total energy of the trimer in the γ-state is

Eγ = h

ΨJ
ΨJ
H(1, 2)
γ |

ΨJ

Since [VD−He, fJ ] = 0, the energy results to be:

Eγ = eγ1 + eγ2 +

This equation will be used to estimate the variational energy of the trimer and to optimize the choice of the correlation
factor.

In order to implement the CHH method for a system of three atoms of masses mi, in positions ri, it is convenient

to introduce the three sets (xi, yi) of Jacobi coordinates:

In the ﬁxed-center limit (m3 =

The total wave function, Ψ(LS)π (1, 2), can be expressed as a sum of three Faddeev-like amplitudes,18 each of wich


explicitely depends upon a diﬀerent Jacobi set:

Ψ(LS)π (1, 2) = ψ(1)

(LS)π (x1, y1) + ψ(2)

(LS)π (x2, y2) + ψ(3)

The amplitudes are then expanded into channels, labelled by the partial angular momenta, ℓx,i and ℓy,i, associated
with xi and yi, respectively:

where Yℓ are ordinary spherical harmonics, and Φ(i)
is a two-dimensional function depending upon the moduli of
the Jacobi vectors. As a result, the parity of the state is given by ℓx,i + ℓy,i, even (odd) for positive (negative) parity.

the CHH basis elements, having quantum numbers (LS)π and corresponding to the set of Jacobi coordinates labelled
by i, are deﬁned as follows:

(cos(2φ)) is a normalized hypherspherical polynomial,
m are associated Laguerre polynomials, and z = βρ, with β a non-linear

k

The other ingredient in the CHH basis elements is the correlation factor, FJ (r1, r2, r12). Due to the strongly repulsive
core of the interatomic potentials, it is convenient to take FJ as a product of pairwise Jastrow-like correlation functions,

FJ (r1, r2, r12) = g(r1)g(r2)fJ (r12) .

The correlation functions mainly describe the short-range behavior of the wave function as the two helium atoms
are close to each other or to the dopant. The polynomial part of the CHH expansion is expected to reproduce the
mid- and long-range conﬁgurations. Therefore, it is preferable to choose correlation functions which behave in the
outer portion of the Hilbert space as smoothly as possible, in order to avoid potentially deleterious biasing of the
polynomial expansion.

Suitable correlation functions to be used in (21) are obtained by solving the two-body Schr¨odinger equation:

h(r) = 0 ,

(cid:19)

where µ is the reduced mass of the considered two-body system, and the pseudo-potential, λe−ξr, is introduced to
adjust the asymptotic behavior of the correlation function in such a way that h(r
1. The parameters ξ
and λ are optimized for each of the diﬀerent cases, SF6-He, 4He-4He and 3He-3He. For the helium-dopant correlation
(h = g), we take µ = mHe, and V ∗ is a modiﬁed SF6-He potential. In fact, in order to build a nodeless correlation
function, it is necessary to reduce the attractive part of the helium-dopant interaction. The repulsive part, on the
other hand, is kept unaltered. In the 4He-4He case (h = fJ , µ = m4He/2), the correlation function has been obtained
as in Ref. 28. The 3He-3He pair does not support a bound state, so the correlation function has been obtained simply
as the solution of the zero-energy Schr¨odinger equation (V ∗ = VHe−He and λ = 0 in Eq. 22).

The sum over the partial angular momenta ℓx, ℓy, although constrained by the values of the total angular momentum
L, the parity and by symmetry considerations, runs over an inﬁnite number of channels. However, in practice only the
lower channels are included, since the higher the angular momentum the less the contribution to the wave function.
Moreover, due to the presence of both the correlation factors FJ and the amplitude expansion, an inﬁnite number of
channels is automatically included, though in a non-ﬂexible way.

In the description of the (LS)π = (00)+, (10)−, (11)− states for 3He2-SF6, we have retained only the lowest angular
momentum channels, that is, ℓx,1 = ℓy,1 = ℓx,3 = ℓy,3 = 0 for (00)+, ℓx,1 = ℓx,3 = 0 and ℓy,1 = ℓy,3 = 1 for (10)−,
ℓx,1 = ℓx,3 = 1 and ℓy,1 = ℓy,3 = 0 for (00)−. The CHH wave functions for these three states are:

In Eqs. (25–27) the linear coeﬃcients,

, are unknown quantities to be determined. The
{
implementation of the variational principle for linear variational parameters leads to a generalized eigenvalues problem
whose solutions, Ei, are upper bounds to the true energy eigenvalues of the three-body Schr¨odinger equation. It is
possible to improve the estimates of the energies by including a larger number of polynomials and channels in the
CHH basis. If N is the dimension of the basis set, the estimates EN
i will monotonically converge from above to the
exact eigenvalues as N is increased. The pattern of convergence for the (00)+ two lowest lying state of 3He2-SF6 is
shown in Table II. An optimum choice of the non-linear parameter β has been adopted to improve the convergence
rate.

IV. RESULTS

Table III collects the energies for the He2-SF6 trimers in the uncorrelated, Jastrow and CHH approaches. The
correlation function is set equal to unity in the uncorrelated calculations, whereas it has been choosen of the McMillan29

in the variational case. Here, σ=2.556 ˚A and b is the only non-linear variational parameter. This type of correlation has
been widely adopted in variational studies of liquid helium since it provides an excellent description of the short-range
properties of the correlated wave function. In fact, it gives the exact short-range behavior for a 12–6 Lennard–Jones
atom–atom interaction. The correlation operator adopted in the CHH expansion has been described in the previous
section. In the CHH case we use diﬀerent correlation functions since a non-linear parameter, β, is already present in
the basis functions (see Eq. 20). Therefore, employing the McMillan form would imply a two non-linear parameters
minimization. However, it has been checked that the use of the McMillan correlation in the CHH expansion produces

7

binding energies within 0.01% of those given in Table III, showing that the converged results are to large extent
independent of the correlation function, provided the short range behavior is adequately described. In Table III, we
also show the kinetic (T ) and potential (V ) contributions to the energy, separating the latter in its dopant-helium
(D-He) and helium-helium (He-He) parts.

The uncorrelated trimers are unbound in all states, with the exception of the spatially antisymmetric (11)− for
3He2-SF6. The orbital antisymmetry reduces the probability of conﬁgurations having the two 3He atoms close to each
other. Hence, the contribution of the strong He-He repulsion at short distances is drastically suppressed. In Ref. 14
an expansion of the single-particle helium s- and p-orbitals in a ﬁnite set of gaussian basis functions centered at the
dopant provided an energy of -31.36 K for the (11)− state in 3He2-SF6. This energy is higher than our uncorrelated
estimate, pointing to a lack of convergence in the Hartree-Fock result in that reference.

The introduction of the Jastrow correlation bounds all trimers, as it suppresses the short-range helium-helium
repulsion. The L=0, positive parity states are the lowest lying ones, the other states having small excitation energies,
lower than 1 K. The values of the variational parameter giving the minimum energies are also reported in the Table.
The b-values for the spatially symmetric trimers are close to those found in the Jastrow correlated studies of bosonic
liquid 4He. As in fermionic liquid 3He, b is smaller for the spatially antisymmetric (11)− state, since both the
correlation and the Pauli principle concur in depleting the VHe−He(r) repulsion.

The converged CHH expansion provides slightly more binding (at most about -0.1 K) to the trimers. This fact
is a strong indication of the high eﬃciency of the simple Jastrow correlated wave function in these systems. The
kinetic and dopant-helium potential energies do not vary much in going from the uncorrelated to the variational and
CHH estimates. The helium-helium potential energy is, instead, strongly dependent on the wave-function. For the
uncorrelated cases the repulsive core is overwhelmingly dominant, except in the Pauli suppressed (11)− state. The
short-range structure of the correlated and CHH wave functions results in a slightly attractive value of
(from
-0.3 K to -1.6 K).

For the mixed 3He-4He-SF6 trimer we give only the energies of the lowest lying (0)+ state. The extension of the
CHH theory presented in Section III to this type of trimer is straightforward. All energies consistently sit in between
the lighter 3He2-SF6 and the heavier 4He2-SF6 cases.

It is worth noticing that the strong supression of the mutual He-He repulsion due to the correlations translates
into a total binding energy which is very close to the sum of the two dimer energies. The sum of the ℓ = 0 energies
57.90 K, respectively, for the combinations 3He2, 4He2 and 3He-4He, which
of Table I gives
are very close to the binding energies of the trimer. The practical eﬀect of the correlations is to reduce the He-He
interaction to a small attraction of
0.2 K. This result is very diﬀerent from the ﬁndings of Ref. 14, with total
binding energies smaller than ours by roughly a factor of two.

We use a simple argument to estimate the accuracy of the inﬁnite dopant mass approximation. From Table III we
observe that, to a very good extent, the He2-SF6 trimer can be considered as the superposition of two independent He-
SF6 dimers. Accordingly, the α–β–trimer corrected kinetic energy results T (α,β) = T (α,β)
M=∞[1 + 1/2(mα/M + mβ/M )].
This correction corresponds to a modiﬁcation of the total trimer energy less than 1%.

For a given trimer, it assumes essentially the same values in the diﬀerent states, reﬂecting the fact that the D-He wave
functions, φ1s and φ1p, are similar. Since the He-SF6 interaction is the same for both helium isotopes, the smaller
3He mass would produce a larger kinetic energy than 4He. In order to minimize the energy, this tendency is partially
compensated by a larger value of
. The He-He average distance increases in
going form the uncorrelated to the variational and CHH cases in the spatially symmetric states, as a consequence of
the intoduction of the correlation, which suppresses short-range He-He conﬁgurations. The eﬀect is not very visible in
the spatially antisymmetric state, (11)−, being these conﬁgurations already largely inhibited by the Pauli principle.

change these values, mostly in the spatially symmetric S = 0 states. For instance, the average cosine corresponds to

case. The change for the spatially antisymmetric state, (11)−, is much less evident.

He correlation and by the optimization of the D-He wave function. Actually, they are similar to the dimer radial
probability densities shown in Fig. 1. As in the dimer case, the 4He atom is more localized than the 3He one because
of its larger mass. For a given trimer, the OBDs do not appreciably depend on the L-values, since the 1s and 1p D-He
wave functions are almost coincident.

because of the strong D-He repulsion. The isotropic distribution shown by the uncorrelated (00)+ TBD disappears
after introducing the He-He correlation, which suppresses the density at low inter-helium distances. As already noticed
in Fig. 4, the (11)− TBD is the least aﬀected by the correlations since it displays a short range He-He repulsion due
to the Pauli principle.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The study of He2-SF6 trimers reveals the crucial role of the dopant heavy molecule in binding these systems. In
fact, the SF6 molecule acts as a ﬁxed center of force in which the He atoms are moving. We have shown that the
speciﬁc features of the SF6-He interaction gives a rotational band in the excitation spectrum of the dimers. The
diﬀerent masses of the 3He and 4He explain in a qualitative way the particular features of each dimer. The solution
of the dimer Schr¨odinger equation provides the single-particle wave functions needed to build the trial wave function
to be used in the variational study of the trimers.

The ground state energies of the three isotopic trimers, namely 4He2-SF6, 3He2-SF6 and 4He-3He-SF6, have been
estimated employing a Jastrow correlated wave-function built up as the product of the dimer wave functions times
a two-body correlation function of the McMillan type between the He atoms, having a single variational parameter.
The accuracy of the variational approach has been tested against the Correlated Hyperspherical Harmonics expansion
method. We have found that the variational results are in excellent agreement with the CHH ones at convergence.

The role of the Jastrow correlation is crucial in order to overcome the strong repulsion between the He atoms.
Actually the uncorrelated variational approach does not bind the trimers, except the 3He2-SF6 one in the (11)−
conﬁguration. The reason is that its wave function is spatially antisymmetric, and therefore the two 3He atoms are

9

kept already apart by the Pauli repulsion. We stress that the preferred spatial conﬁguration assumed by the two He
atoms is such that they take advantage from the mutual attraction, suppressing, as much as possible, the short range
repulsion. As a result, the optimal conﬁguration is not a linear one, with the SF6 molecule in the middle of the two
He atoms. Instead, the He atoms are closer, and their position vectors with respect to the SF6 molecule form an
86o, depending on the particular state. The practical eﬀect of the correlations is that the
angle between
binding energy of the trimer is slighlty larger than the sum of the binging energies of the corresponding dimers.

The He-He correlation does not particularly aﬀect the the helium probability densities in the trimers, which are
similar to those in the dimer. In contrast, the correlation is essential in inverting the energy hierarchy between the
spatially symmetric and antisymmetric conﬁgurations. In fact, in the correlated 3He2-SF6 trimer the (00)+ state,
symmetric in space with both He atoms in the 1s state and S = 0, is more bound than the (11)− state, antisymmetric
in space with one atom in 1s and the other in the 1p state and S = 1 (aligned spins). The uncorrelated approach
does not even bind the (00)+ trimer, whereas the (11)− one is still bound.

The good agreement between the variational and the CHH estimates for the trimers makes us conﬁdent that medium
size He doped clusters can be accurately described by means of a correlated variational wave function. This trial wave
function would be built up from the single-particle wave functions obtained after solving the dimer case, and from an
appropriate Jastrow factor to properly take into account He-He correlations. In this respect, Variational Monte Carlo
and Fermi Hypernetted Chain techniques seem to be the most likely candidates to microscopically address the study
of medium-heavy doped helium nanodroplets.

FIG. 3: Helium densities in the L=0 (upper panel) and L=1 (lower panel) states of the He2-SF6 trimers. The symbols
denote the uncorrelated densities, the lines stand for the CHH ones. In the upper panel the circles and the dashed line stand
for 4He2-SF6 while the triangles and the dash-dotted line correspond to 3He2-SF6. The same notation is used for the L=1
4He2-SF6 case in the lower panel. For the L=1 3He2-SF6 trimer two states are reported, corresponding to S=0 (triangles and
dotted line) and S=1 (stars and dash-dotted line). However, at the scale of the Figure they are hardly distinguishible.

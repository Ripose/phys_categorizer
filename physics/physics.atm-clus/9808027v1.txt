A mechanism of disappearance and formation of the Eﬁmov levels of the
helium 4He trimer is studied when the force of the interatomic interaction is
changed. It is shown that these levels arise from virtual levels which are in
turn formed from (quasi)resonances settled on the real axis. The resonances
including virtual levels are calculated by the method based on the solution of
the boundary value problem, at complex energies, for the Faddeev diﬀerential

All the calculations are performed with the known interatomic Aziz He – He -
potential HFD-B. A very strong repulsive component of this potential at short
distances between helium atoms is approximated by a hard core. A special
attention is paid to the substantiation of the method used for computing
resonances and to the investigation of its applicability range.

I. INTRODUCTION

The 4He three-atomic system is of considerable interest in various ﬁelds of physical
chemistry and molecular physics. Studies of the helium dimer and trimer represent an
important step towards understanding the properties of helium liquid drops, superﬂuidity in
4He ﬁlms, and so on (see, for instance, Refs. [1–3]). Besides, the helium trimer is probably a
unique system where a direct manifestation of the Eﬁmov eﬀect [4] can be observed since the
binding energy ǫd of the 4He dimer is extremely small (
1 mK [5–7]) even in the molecular
scale. For this reason, the helium trimer is certainly of interest for nuclear physicists, too.
Moreover a theoretical study of the 4He trimer is based just on the same methods of the
theory of few-body systems that are used in solving three–body nuclear problems.

From the standpoint of the general theory of few–body systems, the 4He trimer belongs
to three–body systems that are most diﬃcult for a speciﬁc investigation, ﬁrst, owing to its
Eﬁmov nature, and second, because it is necessary to take into account the practically hard
core in the interatomic He – He - interaction [8–11]. At the same time the problem of three

helium atoms can be considered as an example of an ideal three–body quantum problem
since the 4He atoms are identical neutral bosons with zero spin and the analysis of this
problem is complicated neither by separation of spin–isospin variables nor by taking into
account the Coulomb interaction.

There is a great number of experimental and theoretical studies of 4He clusters. However,
most of the theoretical investigations consist merely in computing the ground-state energies
of clusters of that sort, mainly on the basis of variational methods [12–16]. Besides, the
methods based on hyperspherical expansions of the Schr¨odinger and Faddeev equations
[17–19] in the coordinate representation were used. Also, the Faddeev integral equations in
the momentum representation were employed in Refs. [20,21] while the results of Ref. [22] are
based on a direct solving the two-dimensional Faddeev diﬀerential equations in conﬁguration
space. From the experimental studies we would like to mention those of Refs. [5–7,23] where
clusters consisting of a small number of noble gase atoms were investigated.

Though much eﬀort was undertaken for studying molecular clusters various problems re-
lated to the 4He trimer remained beyond the scope of thorough consideration. In particular,
the elastic scattering phases of a helium atom on a helium dimer and breakup amplitudes (at
ultralow energies) have been calculated only recently [24–26]. These computations were pre-
ceded only by the computation of characteristics of the He–He2 scattering at zero energy [20]
and estimation of the recombination rate (1 + 1 + 1

2 + 1) [27].

As a matter of fact, we have already pointed out basic reasons for computations of excited
states and scattering being especially diﬃcult in the 4He3 system. First, this is a low energy
of the dimer ǫd which necessitates to consider very large domains in the conﬁguration space
with a characteristic size of hundreds of ˚A. Second, a very strong repulsive component in the
He–He interaction produces large errors in the standard approximation of the three–atomic
Hamiltonian at short distances between atoms. The capacities of modern computers do not
yet allow one to reach dimensions of grids that would remove both the above-mentioned
reasons and would provide stable results with the use of the conventional methods.

The present paper is a sequel of studies of the 4He3 system undertaken in the pa-
pers [24–26] within an approach that is capable, as we think, to resolve both the above-
In these papers the repulsive component of the He–He
mentioned numerical problems.
interaction at short distances between atons is approximated by a hard core. This allows
one to investigate the 4He3 system within a mathematically rigorous method of solving a
three-body problem in the Boundary-Condition Model developed in [28,29]. An important
advantage of such an approach that essentially diminishes computational errors is the ne-
cessity to approximate, inside the core domains, only the Laplacian operator instead of the
sum of this operator and a huge repulsive components of the He – He - potentials (see [26]).
In [24–26], such an approach has been successfully applied for calculating not only scattering
but also binding energies of the ground and excited states of the helium trimer. Investigation
made in [24–26] has shown that the method proposed in [28,29] is well suited for performing
three–body molecular computations in the case where repulsive components of interatomic
interactions are of a hard core nature.

There is a series of works [18,21,26] showing that the excited state of the 4He trimer is
initiated indeed by the Eﬁmov eﬀect
[4]. In these works the various versions of the Aziz
4He–4He potential were employed (HFDHE2 [8], HFD-B [9], and LM2M2 [10]). However,
the basic result of Refs. [18,21,26] on the excited state of the helium trimer is the same: this
state disappears when the interatomic potential is multiplied by the “ampliﬁcation factor”
λ of order 1.2. More precisely, if this potential is multiplied by the increasing factor λ > 1

then the following eﬀect is observed. First, the diﬀerence ǫd(λ)
t (λ) between the dimer
energy ǫd(λ) and the energy of the trimer excited state E(1)
t (λ) increases. Then the behavior
of this diﬀerence radically changes and with further increase of λ it monotonously decreases.

to the Eﬁmov nature of the trimer excited state. And vice versa, when λ slightly decreases

This paper is aimed at elucidating the fate of the trimer excited state upon its disap-
pearance in the physical sheet when λ > 1 and at studying the mechanism of arising of
new excited states when λ < 1. As the interatomic He – He potential, we use the potential
HFD-B [9]. We have established that for such He – He - interactions the trimer excited level

1.18 and with further decreasing λ it transforms
into a virtual level of the ﬁrst order (a simple real pole of the analytic continuation of the
scattering matrix) lying in the unphysical energy sheet adjoining the physical sheet along
the spectral interval between ǫd and the three–body threshold. We trace the position of this
level for λ increasing up to 1.5. Besides, we have found that the excited (Eﬁmov) levels for
λ < 1 also originate from virtual levels of the ﬁrst order that are formed in pairs. Before a
pair of virtual levels appears, there occurs a fusion of a pair of conjugate resonances of the
ﬁrst order (simple complex poles of the analytic continuation of the scattering matrix in the
unphysical sheet) resulting in the virtual level of the second order.

t merges with the threshold ǫd at λ

As it will be clear from the further exposition (see Sect. III), the above-mentioned res-
onances are not, generally speaking, genuine resonances of the 4He3 trimer since they are
situated outside of the energy domain for which we can rigorously prove the applicability of
the method we are using for computing the resonances. We will call the resonances found
outside the range of guaranteed applicability of the method the (quasi)resonances.

The paper is organized as follows.
In Sect. II, we describe the method of search for resonances in a three–body system on the
basis of the Faddeev diﬀerential equations. The idea of the method consists in calculating
the analytic continuation of the component S0(z) (see formula (6)) of the scattering matrix
corresponding to the (2 + 1
2 + 1) process, in the physical sheet with the use of these
equations. A particular attention in this section is paid to the description of the parabolic
domain on the physical sheet where one can analytically continue the function S0(z) by
numerical solving the coordinate space Faddeev partial equations. For the potentials we
use, the three–body resonances (including virtual levels) lying in the unphysical sheet of
energy z plane adjoining the physical sheet along the interval (ǫd, 0) are the roots of the
function S0(z) in the physical sheet. We have earlier employed this method for computing
resonances as roots of S0(z) in the three–nucleon problem [30].

II. METHOD FOR SEARCH OF RESONANCES IN A THREE–BODY SYSTEM
ON THE BASIS OF THE FADDEEV DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

A. Faddeev partial diﬀerential equations in the case of smooth potentials

In this paper, we will consider the 4He3 system in the state with the total angular

momentum L = 0.

First we consider the case where the interatomic interactions are described by conven-
tional smooth potentials that include no hard-core component.
In this case, the angular
partial analysis reduces the initial Faddeev equation for three identical bosons to a system
of coupled two-dimensional integro-diﬀerential equations [31]

Here, x, y stand for the standard Jacobi variables, x

0 and y

which are quite standard when the expansions over bispherical basis are used. The potential
V (x) is assumed to be central. In our paper, the energy z can get both real and complex
values. At L = 0 the partial angular momentum l corresponds both to the dimer and an
additional atom. The momentum l can assume only even values, l = 0, 2, 4, . . . .

The partial wave functions Ψl(x, y) are expressed through the Faddeev partial compo-

nents Fl(x, y) by the relations

We assume that the 4He2 dimer has an only bound state with an energy ǫd, ǫd < 0, and

of ψd(x) are real. The notations ρ, ρ =

hyperradius and hyperangle. The coeﬃcient a0(z), z = E + i0, for E > ǫd is the elastic
scattering amplitude. The functions Al(E + i0, θ) provide us, at E > 0, the corresponding
partial Faddeev breakup amplitudes. Note that for z = E + i0 the correction terms o(1) in

B. Holomorphy domains of the Faddeev components Fl(z) and scattering matrix S0(z)

Our goal is to study the analytic continuation of the scattering matrix S0(z) into the
complex plane (the physical sheet). As it follows from the results of Refs. [33,34], roots of
the function S0(z) in the physical sheet of energy z plane correspond to the location of the
three-body resonances situated in the unphysical sheet connected with the physical sheet
by crossing the spectral interval (ǫd, 0). This statement is a particular case of more general
statements regarding the three-body resonances obtained in [33,34] for the case of two-body
potentials decreasing in the coordinate space not slower than exponentially. We assume that
V (x) is just a potential which falls oﬀ exponentially and, thus, for all x

with some positive C and µ. For the sake of simplicity we even assume sometimes that V (x)
is ﬁnite, i. e., V (x) = 0 for x > r0, r0 > 0. Looking ahead, we note that, in fact, in our

1Here we speak about the wave functions usually denoted by sign “(+)”. The asymptotics of
these functions in the total three-body conﬁguration space R6 contains, apart from the incident
wave, only the so-called outgoing spherical waves (see, e.g., [31]).

numerical computations of the 4He3 system at complex energies we make a “cutoﬀ” of the
interatomic He – He - potential at a suﬃciently large radius r0.

It is well known that diﬀerent representations of the same holomorphic function (for
instance, either by a series or by an integral) allow one to describe this function only in
some parts of its Riemann surface. The description [33,34] of the holomorphy domains for
diﬀerent truncations of the total three-body scattering matrix in the physical sheet was based
on the use of the Faddeev integral equations in the momentum representation. In this paper,
we make use of the Faddeev equations in the conﬁguration space. Therefore it is necessary
to perform an investigation, independent of [33,34], of domains in the physical sheet where
we can analytically continue the Faddeev components Fl(x, y; z) and the amplitudes a0(z)
and Al(z, θ) just with the use of the conﬁguration space techniques.

Let us list brieﬂy the main results of this investigation obtained by us for the 4He3
system under the assumption (7). To formulate these results we distinguish the following
three domains in the complex plane C.

1◦. The domain Π(Ψ) where the Faddeev components Fl(x, y; z) (and, hence, the wave

functions Ψl(x, y; z)) can be analytically continued in z so that the diﬀerences

For ﬁxed x, y the functions Φl(x, y; z) are continuous in z up to the rims of the cut along

2◦. The domain Π(A) where both the elastic scattering amplitude a0(z) and the Faddeev
σ3B, provided that the
breakup amplitudes Al(z, θ) can be analytically continued in z, z
functions Fl(x, y; z) obey the asymptotic formulas (5). This domain is described by the

3◦. And ﬁnally, we distinguish the domain Π(S), most interesting for us, where the
analytic continuation in z, z

a0(z) (and consequently, for the scattering matrix S0(z)); the analytic continuabilty of the
amplitudes Al(z, θ) in the whole domain Π(S) is not required. The set Π(S) is a geometric

then the domain Π(S) is described by the inequality (15); whereas

As to the curves bounding the domains (10) and (11), we only notice that their order with
respect to the variables Re z and Im z is higher than the second order. It is easy to check
that each of these curves is connected, symmetric with respect to the Re z axis and crosses
the latter only once. For the ﬁrst curve this intersection occurs at z = 3

In the problem under consideration, the spectrum of the Faddeev matrix operator deﬁned
by the l.h.s. of Eqs. (18) and by the boundary conditions (3) in the Hilbert space constituted
L2(R2
+), coincides with the spectrum σ3B of the
of the vectors Φ = (Φ0, Φ2, . . . , Φlmax), Φl ∈
corresponding three-boson Schr¨odinger operator with two-body potentials V (x) only acting
Π(Ψ) lying outside
in the states with l = 0, 2, . . . , lmax. This means that for any energy z
of the spectrum σ3B, the inhomogeneous system (18) is uniquely solvable in the class of
the functions Φl(z)
+), l = 0, 2, . . . , lmax. Since outside of the set σ3B the resolvent
of the Faddeev operator is a holomorphic operator-valued function of the variable z, each
of the components Φl(z) of the solution of Eqs. (18) also is a holomorphic function of
z
σ3B. The bound-state energies of the three-boson system under consideration
turn out to be poles of the ﬁrst order for Φl(z). Thus, the Faddeev partial components
Fl(x, y; z) admit the analytic continuation in z in the form (8) into the domain Π(Ψ)
σ3B.
The proof of the assertions of 2◦ and 3◦ regarding the domains Π(S) and Π(A) is rather
cumbersome. This is why we here only outline its main steps. Note that the proof is based
on the integral equations method and it is quite standard (see, for instance, Ref. [31], Chap-
ter V). First, the equations (18) are rewritten in the form of the Faddeev partial integral
z in (18). Since the
equations. To do this, it suﬃces to reverse the operators H0,l + V
variables x and y in H0,l are separated, the kernels R(l)

,
}
of the respective resolvents R(l)
1 are explicitly expressed in terms of
z)−
the two-body problem. Analytic properties in the variable z and coordinate asymptotics of
the kernels R(l)
v (X, X ′; z) are well known (see Ref. [31], Chapters IV and V). Iterations ﬁrst
“improve” and then stabilize the asymptotic properties of the iterated kernels and inhomo-
geneous terms of the Faddeev equations. (In the case under consideration, this stabilization
requires only three iterations.) Further, it turns out that, for z
), the iterated ker-
nels are represented by sums of exponentially decreasing terms admitting, in certain domains
of the conﬁguration space, an explicit asymptotic factorization with respect to X and X ′.
Since we are working in the domain where χl(z)
+), the corresponding asymptotic
factors of these terms, along with the asymptotics of the iterations of the inhomogeneous
term, determine the coordinate asymptotics of the functions Φl(x, y; z). Therefore, ﬁnally
we are able to determine the geometric locus of the points z in the complex plane for which
there exists a (non-empty) set in the conﬁguration space such that the leading term of the
coordinate asymptotics of the function Φl(x, y; z) in this set represents a term of the form
a0(z)ψd(x) exp(i√z
ǫd y), and thus, for these z the scattering matrix S0(z) is well deﬁned.
This geometrical locus is just the domain Π(S). In this domain, as y

Faddeev partial components Fl(x, y) by the formulas (4). The components Fl(x, y) satisfy
the standard boundary conditions (3). The two-body central potential V (x) acts only beyond
the core domain, i. e. only where x > c. We assume as before that V (x) falls oﬀ not slower
and, hence, it satisﬁes the condition (7) for some C > 0 and
than exponentially as x

A main diﬀerence between the model with hard core and those with smooth potentials

is that the functions Fl(x, y) in this model satisfy the auxiliary boundary conditions

It can be shown that in fact the conditions (25) force the wave functions (4) to vanish also
inside the core domain at all energies except for a certain countable set of real values of z
(see Ref. [26] and references therein).

Asymptotic conditions for the partial Faddeev components Fl(x, y; z) of the (2 + 1

Recall that those points z on unphysical sheets are called resonances where the analyt-

part Im z = 0 and Re z < ǫd are called the virtual levels.

Thus, we have here presented a simple proof of the fact that the resonances including the
virtual levels corresponding to poles of the analytic continuation of the scattering matrix
S0(z) in the unphysical sheet connected with the physical one by crossing the spectral interval
[ǫd, 0] are the roots of this matrix in the physical sheet. At the same time, the poles of the
function S0(z) in the physical sheet correspond to bound states of the three-boson system
under consideration.

Concluding the subsection, we note that it follows from Eq. (28) that a0(z) =

III. NUMERICAL METHOD AND RESULTS OF COMPUTATIONS

In the present work we make use of the Faddeev equations (24) considered together with
the boundary conditions (3), (5) and (25) to calculate the values of the 4He3 scattering
matrix S0(z) in the physical sheet. We search for the resonances including the virtual levels
as roots of S0(z) and for the bound-state energies as positions of poles of S0(z). All the
results presented below are obtained for the case lmax = 0.

In all our calculations, ~2/m = 12.12 K ˚A2. As the interatomic He – He - interaction we
employed the widely used semiempirical potential HFD-B constructed by R. A. Aziz and
co-workers [9]. This potential is of the form

For completeness the parameters of the potential HFD-B are given in Table I.

The value of the parameter c (the core “diameter” of particles) is chosen to be so small
that its further decrease does not appreciably inﬂuence the dimer binding energy ǫd and the
energy of the trimer ground state E(0)
. Unlike papers [24–26], where c was taken to be equal
0.7 ˚A, now we take c = 1.3 ˚A. We have found that such a value of c provides at least six
reliable ﬁgures of ǫd and three ﬁgures of E(0)
.

Since the statements of Sect. II are valid, generally speaking, only for the potentials
decreasing not slower than exponentially, we cut oﬀ the potential HFD-B setting V (x) = 0
for x > r0. We have established that this cutoﬀ for r0 & 95 ˚A provides the same values of
ǫd (ǫd =
0.096 K) and phases δ0(p) which were obtained in
our earlier calculations [24–26] performed with the potential HFD-B. Comparison of these
results with results of other researchers can be found in Refs. [24–26]. In all the calculations
of the present work we take r0 = 100 ˚A. Note that if the formulas from Sect. II including
the parameter µ are used for ﬁnite potentials, one should set µ = +

Before making numerical approximation of the system of equations (3), (24), (25) at
lmax = 0 we rewrite it in terms of a new unknown function Φ0(x, y; z) that is expressed via
the Faddeev component F0(x, y; z) by the relation (8). Note that for z
σ3B the
function Φ0(x, y; z) is square integrable in x, y (see Sect. II B). Therefore, this function is
uniquely determined by the asymptotic condition

When solving the boundary-value problem (3), (5), (24), (25) written in terms of the

prescribed by the need to have a higher density of points in the domain where the functions
Φl(x, y; z) are most rapidly changing, i. e. for small values of ρ and/or x and lower in the
asymptotic domain. In this work, we used the grids of dimension Nθ = Nρ = 600 — 1000.
The number of the last arc knots in θ lying in the core domain was usually equal to N (ρ)

The ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation of the integro-diﬀerential equations (24) and bound-
ary conditions (3), (25) for lmax = 0 reduces the problem to a system of NρNθ linear algebraic
equations. The ﬁnite-diﬀerence equations corresponding to the arc i = Nρ include initially
the values of the unknown function Φ(x, y; z) from the arc i = Nρ + 1. To eliminate them,
we express these values through the values of Φ(x, y; z) on the arcs i = Nρ and i = Nρ −
1
by using the asymptotic formula (5), just in the manner described in the concluding part
of Appendix A of Ref. [26]. In [26], this approach was only used for computing the energies
of bound states. Now we extend it also on the scattering problem. (Note that the formulas
(A10) and (A11) in [26] related to the described approach contain misprints. The values
C −Nρ in these formulas should be replaced with inverse values 1/C −Nρ.) The matrix of the
resultant system of equations has a block-three-diagonal form (see Ref. [26], Appendix A).

Every block has the dimension Nθ ×
values of the function Φ(x, y; z) in the grid knots belonging to a certain arc ρ = ρi. The
main diagonal of the matrix consists of Nρ such blocks.

In contrast to [24–26], in the present paper we solve the block-three-diagonal algebraic
system on the basis of the matrix sweep method. This allows us to dispense with writing the

13

system matrix on the hard drive and to carry out all the operations related to its inversion
immediately in RAM. Besides, the matrix sweep method reduces almost by one order the
computer time required for computations on the grids of the same dimensions as in [24–26].

As the relationship (30) implies the symmetry of properties of the scattering matrix S0(z)
with respect to the real axis, we performed all the calculations for S0(z) only for Im z
0
(except the tests of the code). We start with a study of graph surfaces of the real and imag-
inary parts of the scattering matrix S0(z) in the domain of its holomorphy Π(S)
σ3B. The
root lines of the functions Re S0(z) and Im S0(z) obtained in the case of the grid parameters
Nθ = Nρ = 600 and ρmax = 600 ˚A are depicted in Fig. 1. Both resonances (roots of S0(z))
and bound-state energies (poles of S0(z)) of the 4He trimer are associated with the intersec-
tion points of the curves Re S0(z) = 0 and Im S0(z) = 0. When the roots or poles are simple,
these curves intersect each other at the right angle. Note that for real z
ǫd the function
S0(z) is real and, thus, Im S0(z) = 0. In Fig. 1, along with the root lines we also plot the
boundaries of the domains Π(S), Π(A) and Π(Ψ). One can observe that a “good” domain Π(S)
includes none of the points of intersection of the root lines Re S0(z) = 0 and Im S0(z) = 0.
Nevertheless, as we will see below, the going beyond this domain is of an interest, even
Π(S) and the function S0(z) calcu-
though the asymptotic formula (5) is not valid for z
lated there cannot be interpreted as the scattering matrix. The caption for Fig. 1 points out
positions of the four “resonances”, the roots of S0(z), found immediately beyond the bound-
ary of the domain Π(S). As one could expect, the values of the function S0(z) at z
Π(S)
and positions of its roots in C
Π(S) turn out to be unstable and strongly depend on the value
of the cutoﬀ radius ρmax, whereas the dependence on the number of knots is weak. In par-
ticular, for ρmax = 400 ˚A, a (quasi)resonance, closest to the real axis, is situated at the point
1.90 + i 1.85) mK, if Nθ = Nρ = 520,
(
−
−
1.89 + i 1.86) mK if Nθ = Nρ = 800. The same (quasi)resonance in Fig. 1
and at the point (
(calculated for ρmax = 600 ˚A) is situated at the point (
2.34 + i 0.97) mK. If Nθ = Nρ = 600
is ﬁxed, the increase of ρmax up to 800 ˚A shifts this point to the point (
2.44 + i 0.65) mK.
All the aforesaid regarding the instability of the function S0(z) values and positions of its
roots beyond the domain Π(S) bears no relation to its pole at the point z = E(1)
2.46 mK,
corresponding to a trimer excited-state energy, even though this energy does not belong
to Π(S). The point is that the position of the pole of S0(z) is only determined by the
position of the root of the determinant of the linear algebraic system we solve, whereas the
inhomogeneous term of the system plays no role. Therefore, the search for the poles of the
grid function S0(z) is equivalent to the search for the binding energies of the trimer. The
grids we have used turn out to be quite suﬃcient for this purpose. The convergence of
our results for E(1)
t with respect to the parameters Nθ, Nρ, ρmax and their accuracy can be
judged from the values of the diﬀerence ǫd −

We would like to stress that we do not consider the roots of function S0(z) drawn in
Fig. 1 as genuine resonances for the 4He3 system since they are situated beyond the domain
Π(S) where the applicability of our method is proved. We should rather consider them as
artifacts of the method. However it is remarkable that the “true” (i. e., getting inside Π(S))
virtual levels and then the energies of the excited (Eﬁmov) states appear just due to these
(quasi)resonances when the potential V (x) is weakened. This is the object of our further
consideration.

To establish the mechanism of formation of new excited states in the 4He trimer, we have
ﬁrst calculated the scattering matrix S0(z) for λ < 1. In Table III for some values of λ from
the interval between 0.995 and 0.975, we present the positions of roots and poles of S0(z),
we have obtained at real z < ǫd(λ). We have found that for a value of λ slightly smaller than
0.9885, the (quasi)resonance closest to the real axis (see Fig. 1) gets on it and transforms into
a virtual level (the root of S0(z)) of the second order corresponding to the energy value where
R, z < ǫd, is tangent to the axis z. This virtual level is preceded by
the graph of S0(z), z
the (quasi)resonances z = (
1.58 + i 0.168) for λ = 0.989 and
1.59 + i 0.064) for λ = 0.9885. The originating virtual
0.99 + i 0.04) mK (z/

level is of the second order since simultaneously with the root of the function S0(z), also
the conjugate root of this function gets on the real axis. With a subsequent decrease of λ
the virtual level of the second order splits into a pair of the virtual levels E(2)
,

E(2)
of the ﬁrst order which move in opposite directions. A characteristic behavior
of the scattering matrix S0(z) when resonances transform into virtual levels is shown in
Fig. 2. The virtual level E(2)
moves towards the threshold ǫd and “collides” with it at
λ < 0.98. For λ = 0.975 the function S0(z) has no longer the root corresponding to E(2)
.

Instead of the root, it acquires a new pole corresponding to the second excited state of the
trimer with the energy E(2)
and E(2)
appear
beyond the domain Π(S), already at λ = 0.985 the point E(2)
turns out to be inside this
domain. Therefore, it should be considered as a “true” virtual level of the trimer. We expect
that the subsequent Eﬁmov levels originate from the virtual levels just according to the same
scheme as the level E(2)

The other purpose of the present investigation is to determine the mechanism of disap-
pearance of the excited state of the helium trimer when the two-body interactions become
stronger owing to the increasing coupling constant λ > 1. It turned out that this disappear-
ance proceeds just according to the scheme of the formation of new excited states; only the
order of occurring events is inverse.

The results of our computations of the energy E(1)

t when λ changes from 1.05 to 1.17 are
given in Table IV. In the interval between λ = 1.17 and λ = 1.18 there occurs a “jump” of
the level E(1)
on the unphysical sheet and it transforms from the pole of the function S0(z)
into its root, E(1)
, corresponding to the trimer virtual level. The results of calculation of

values of λ presented in Tables IV and V, the dimer possesses an only bound state. We have
found that the ﬁrst excited state of the dimer appears only at λ = 6.81.

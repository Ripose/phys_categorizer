The optical response of the lowest energy isomers of the C20 family is cal-
culated using time-dependent density functional theory within a real-space,
real-time scheme. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences are found among the spectra of the
diﬀerent isomers, and thus we propose optical spectroscopy as a tool for ex-
perimental investigation of the structure of these important clusters.

Abstract

1

Fullerenes are carbon clusters formed by the closing of a graphitic sheet; the needed
curvature is supplied by the insertion, among a given number of graphitic hexagons, of
twelve pentagons .1 Besides its most well-known representative, the nearly spherical C60,
a wide variety of fullerenes has been predicted and experimentally observed. However, as
we reduce the number of atoms, these structures become more reactive and unstable: the
pentagons present in fullerene-like geometries, although being its major source of interest,
are a cause of strain, specially if two of them are neighbors. Small fullerenes, with their
high proportion of pentagons, have been actively sought and studied (see, e.g. Reference 2).
Recent discoveries include the synthesis and puriﬁcation of the solid form of C36,3 and the
production of the cage and bowl isomers of C20,4 - the vibronic ﬁne structure in photoelectron
spectra of the cage has also been recently calculated,5 conﬁrming the previous experimental
assignation.

These medium-sized carbon clusters are predicted to possess a wide variety of isomers
like cages, bowls, planar graphitic structures, rings and linear chains. The theoretical and
experimental study of the diﬀerent isomers is important, because it may help us to better
understanding the way fullerenes form. Several growth mechanisms have been proposed over
the past years.6 In the so-called “pentagon road”, fullerenes grow by the addition of small
carbon fragments to bowl-like structures. The “fullerene road” is similar to the pentagon
road, but the addition of the small carbon fragments is made to closed cage-like clusters.
However, neither cages or bowls are usually seen in experiments.7 The most common tech-
nique for carbon cluster formation is laser vaporization of graphite and subsequent supersonic
expansion into an inert gas atmosphere. At these high temperatures the preferred isomers
are rings and chains. This led Jarrold and co-workers to propose a third path, namely that
fullerenes grow by the coalescence and annealing of medium sized carbon rings.8

The smallest possible fullerene, consisting only of 12 pentagons with no graphitic
hexagons intercalated, is the C20 cage isomer.9 Other low energy structures of C20 include
a bowl (which may be considered a C60 fragment), several rings, and other closed 3D ar-
rangements. Prinzbach et al4 have recently reported the production of the cage and bowl
members of the family. The smallest fullerene cannot be expected to form spontaneously,
but has been produced from a similarly shaped precursor C20H20, after replacing hydrogen
with Br. The bowl was produced in the same way, and photoelectron spectroscopy was used
to distinguish unambiguously between the diﬀerent species.

It has not been possible to make reliable theoretical predictions of the most stable struc-
ture of C20. In fact, diﬀerent levels of theories favor diﬀerent geometries: at the Hartree-Fock
level, the ring is the ground state, followed by the bowl and the cage.10 Density functional
theory (DFT)11 in its local density approximation (LDA) reverses the order, giving the cage
the lowest energy structure.10,12 Another complication is that entropy eﬀects can aﬀect the
relative stability. Molecular-dynamics simulations with the Car-Parrinello method and the
LDA show that increasing temperature changes the favored structure from cage to bowl,
then to the ring.13 Better functionals are availabe with the generalized gradient approxima-
tion (GGA), but their use does not clarify matters: the ordering of the isomers depends on
the correction used.14,10,12 Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and coupled cluster (CC) methods
have also been applied in an attempt to resolve the issue, yielding bowl-ring-cage ordering
using the former method10 and cage-bowl-ring using the latter.15 Furthermore, it seems that
the results are sensitive to the pseudopotential employed.15 Changing slightly the pseudopo-

2

tential cutoﬀ radius may actually reverse the ordering of the isomers.

Thus it is important to ﬁnd a experimental method to determine the structure that is
sensitive enough to be usable with the available cluster beam intensities.
In this respect
optical spectroscopy is a useful tool to characterize geometries. Some time ago, Rubio et
al16 proposed this technique to determine the structure of semiconductor and metal clusters.
In particular, they showed that the optical absorption spectra of diﬀerent isomers of Si4 and
Si8 are suﬃciently diﬀerent to distinguish easily between them. The situation is similar with
respect to carbon structures. The time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) was
found to be quite reliable for determining the energies of the strong transitions in a variety
of carbon structures ranging from chains17 to conjugated carbon molecules.18 In cases where
the spectra could be compared with experiment, the lowest strong transition is typically
reproduced to an accuracy of a few tenth of eV. Comparing rings and chains, the transition
energies diﬀer by several eV, easily allowing the structures to be distinguished. Thus it
is quite promising to use the predicted excitation spectra of C20 structures to distinguish
between them. In this spirit, the present study is aimed at the calculation of the optical
response of six members of the C20 family (see Fig. 1): the smallest fullerene (“cage”),
which is a Jahn-Teller distortion of a dodecahedron, the ring, the bowl, and three cage-
like structures, (d), (e) and (f). The structures (d) and (f), related by the Stone-Wales
transformation, are quite regular, and composed of four hexagons, four pentagons, and four
four-membered rings. These clusters are the six members with lower energy as calculated by
Jones19 within the LDA approximation. Other structures, such as bicyclic rings and chains,
may be favoured by entropy at high temperature and have been observed experimentally.
However, neither of them seem to be a possible ground state. We will show that calculations
based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) predict characteristic optical
spectra for the ring, cage and bowl species.

We now describe brieﬂy the methodology of the calculation of optical absorption in the
TDDFT. We start with ground state structures and electron orbitals, determined with some
implementation of DFT. This gives the initial condition for solving the time-dependent
Kohn-Sham equation. Mathematically, there are several very diﬀerent methods for solving
the equation, but in principle the results should be the same if the energy functional is the
same. Our method, solving the equation in real time and representing the wave function on
a uniform spatial grid, is based on a nuclear physics algorithm,20 and has been described
several times before.17,18,21 The real-time response to an impulsive perturbation is Fourier-
transformed to get the dynamic polarizability in the entire range of interest. Of more
direct physical interest is the optical absorption strength function S(E), obtained from the
imaginary part of the polarizability by the equation

S(E) =

Im α(E).

With this deﬁnition, the f -sum rule is given by the integral

S(E)dE = N.

For the Kohn-Sham energy functional, we used the LDA with the prescription of Ref-
erence 22. Use of gradient corrections is possible within this framework, but results for
the optical absorption have been reported to be quite insensitive to this change.23 Recent
calculations of electronic excitations of a carbon-based molecule such as benzene24,25 also
show a very close agreement. Slightly more important modiﬁcations are to be expected if

exact-exchange functionals are used, although the qualitative diﬀerences among the spectra
should remain. We also used a pseudopotential to avoid explicit consideration of the 1s
electrons, choosing the norm-conserving soft-core pseudopotential of Reference 26. The nu-
merical parameters that need to be speciﬁed for the calculation are: mesh spacing, 0.25 ˚A;
wave function domain, sphere of radius 8 ˚A (slightly larger in the case of the ring); time step,
0.001 ¯heV−1; number of time steps, 20,000. Thus the total propagation time is T = 20 ¯heV−1.
One technical point that should be mentioned is that the Fourier transform over the ﬁnite
interval T gives peaks that are broadened by the time cutoﬀ. In presenting the results, one
removes the spurious oscillations associated with the time cutoﬀ by multiplying by a ﬁlter
function, amounting to a convolution in the frequency domain. The sum rule is preserved
providing the ﬁlter function has zero slope at t = 0. In any case, with T = 20 ¯h eV−1, the
individual states have a width of about 0.4 eV.

For the calculations reported here, we used structures from two sources. The geometries
of the bowl, cage and ring isomers were determined by Raghavachari et al.14 For the (d),
(e) and (f) isomers, we used those obtained by Jones from an all-electron density functional
LSD calculation with an extended Gaussian basis set.19 As mentioned earlier, the energy
diﬀerences between the isomers are quite sensitive to details of the energy functional and
the pseudopotential. Fortunately that is not the case at all for the optical spectra. The
optical response is quite insensitive to changes in the pseudopotential and in the energy
functional, providing the structures do not change signiﬁcantly. The optical spectra depend
very much on the Kohn-Sham potential, but the diﬀerences in that are slight between the
diﬀerent parameterizations of DFT. The ionization potential (IP) and electron aﬃnities
of the diﬀerent structures is given in Table I. These quantities are calculated in the DFT
by diﬀerences of total energies of systems with diﬀering numbers of electrons but the same
geometry. The results for the electronic aﬃnity are good to within 0.2 eV if compared to the
experimental values reported by Prinzbach et al in Reference 4, which have been obtained
through photoelectron spectra.

The results of our TDDFT calculations of the optical absorption are shown in Table
II and Fig. 2. Table II gives the energies and strengths of the lowest transitions with
appreciable strength, and Fig. 2 displays the strength function for energies up to the vacuum
ultraviolet. The solid lines show the TDDFT results averaged over all orientations of the
system. In the top panel we also show by a dashed line the single-electron response, which
corresponds to diﬀerence of eigenvalues of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals. The dotted lines
in the panels for the ring and bowl show the response perpendicular to the plane of the
ring or the bowl center. This direction does not excite π − π∗ transitions in the ring and is
almost negligible in the near ultraviolet frequencies (below 8eV), compared with the response
within the plane. In the case of the bowl, the perpendicular response cannot be seen in the
graph because of its extreme weakness in that energy range. This can be understood because
there are no collective oscillations of the electrons in that direction. While present molecular
beam experiments are not able to discriminate between the diﬀerent spatial directions, the
averaged spectra are still suﬃciently diﬀerent to discriminate between the diﬀerent structures
without ambiguity.

We can distinguish two regions in all the graphs: the peaks which can be seen in the near
ultraviolet, and a broad absorption that starts at around 7.5 eV. The excitations responsible
for this latter region are above the ionization threshold, which range from 7.5 to about 9 eV

4

for all cases considered, as can be seen from Table I. Since the LDA is unreliable for describing
the ionization process (due to incorrect asymptotic potential), we will focus our attention
on the relative positioning and intensity of the lower energy peaks.

The ring exhibits the largest gap in the spectrum and has has the strongest collective
transition. The bowl also has a high gap, larger than 5 eV, but the ﬁrst signiﬁcant transition
is an order of magnitude weaker than in the ring. The relative intensities of the peaks, the
fact that the ﬁrst excitation is divided into two for the bowl, and the relative strength of
the excitation in the 6-7 eV region, can all be used to distinguish the bowl from the ring
isomer.

The spectra of the four three-dimensional isomers start at much lower energy and are
more similar to each other, which is expected from their similar geometries. The cage
isomer shows two clear peaks at 3.9 and 5.1 eV, with the second much stronger than the
ﬁrst one. Most of the strength concentrates above the ionization threshold, and has a broad
plateau starting at around 7 eV. This is clearly diﬀerent from planar-like isomers, where
an important fraction of the strength appears below 7 eV. Isomer (d) can be distinguished
by the presence of a transition at quite low energy, 2.5 eV, as well as by the fragmentation
into many states going up to 6 eV. Isomer (e) diﬀers from the cage by the presence of a
transition (”B”) between the transitions that would be seen in the cage. The spectrum of
isomer (f) is similar to the cage up to the second peak, but shifted down by about 0.3 eV.
This is close to the borderline where the TDDFT energies are reliable. However, isomer (f)
also has a third peak near 6 eV, in a region where there is a gap in the cage spectrum, and
that diﬀerence would be deﬁnitive.

We also report calculations for the static polarizability in Table I. These have been

calculated in two ways, by the formula

α(0) =

and by adding a static ﬁeld to the DFT calculation. The two methods agree within 2%,
providing an additional check on our numerical TDDFT computations. We see that the
predicted polarizabilities diﬀer substantially between ring, bowl, and closed structure, but
there is little discrimination among the closed structures.

In conclusion, we have found that the optical absorption spectra calculated in the
TDDFT for diﬀerent candidate structures of C20 show marked diﬀerences that could be
used for structural determination. Some diﬀerences appear already in the visible and near
ultraviolet, and complete discrimination should be possible with a measurement of the spec-
trum extending up to the 6 eV region.

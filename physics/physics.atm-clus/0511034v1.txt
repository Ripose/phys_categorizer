The dynamics and thermodynamics of melting in two-dimensional Coulomb clusters is revisited
using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. Several parameters are considered, includ-
ing the Lindemann index, the largest Lyapunov exponent and the diﬀusion constant. In addition
to the orientational and radial melting processes, isomerizations and complex size eﬀects are seen
to occur in a very similar way to atomic and molecular clusters. The results are discussed in terms
of the energy landscape represented through disconnectivity graphs, with proper attention paid to
the broken ergodicity problems in simulations. Clusters bound by 1/r3 and e
/r forces, and
heterogeneous clusters made of singly- and doubly-charged species, are also studied, as well as the
evolution toward larger systems.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁnite size analogs of two-dimensional (2D) Wigner
crystals have received considerable attention from theo-
reticians [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16], and more recently also from experimental groups
[17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Particles in mutual repulsion can be
conﬁned using a variety of methods, most importantly
electrostatic traps of the Paul or Penning types, and sim-
ple hard walls, usually of circular shape. The repulsion
between particles depends upon the details of the ex-
periment. Arrays of electrons on the surface of liquid
helium [22] or in quantum dots [23] can be described
by conventional Coulomb forces. However, logarithmic
forces are more relevant for vortex clusters in superﬂuids
[24] or Bose-Einstein condensates [25]. Mesoscopic col-
loidal particles undergo dipolar 1/r3 interactions within
an external magnetic ﬁeld [26], or a Yukawa (screened
Coulomb) potential when they are charged and placed in
a viscous medium.

Finite 2D assemblies have also been synthesised on a
more macroscopic scale, using metal particles close to
1 mm in size [19]. In this study, the authors were able
to visualise and locate not only stable conﬁgurations,
but they could also estimate the shape of the transition
states, which are here deﬁned as stationary points with
Hessian index one [47].

Another example of experimentally accessible Wigner
crystals occurs for dusty plasmas. These highly charged
particles of micrometer size and charges up to Z = 104
can be stabilised as gaseous plasmas. The gravitational
forces and the electric ﬁeld balance each other, so that the
dust particles form highly regular two-dimensional struc-
tures. By changing the electric ﬁeld, or conversely the
pressure, of the plasma, transitions from solid to liquid-

like phases are observed [17]. A two-stage melting was
proposed, which does not follow the predictions of two-
dimensional melting theories, but rather goes through an
intermediate phase. This phase has been described as an
oscillating crystal [21]. Finally, by measuring the spectra
of dust particles, it has been suggested that the dynamics
may be a size-dependent phenomenon, that is the eﬀects
of various types of motion such as intershell rotation and
breathing may play diﬀerent roles [20].

A major part of our theoretical understanding of the
above systems comes from numerical studies. The static
properties of the assemblies were obtained using opti-
mization methods ranging from simulated annealing to
genetic algorithms, and a Mendeleev-type table was pro-
posed by several authors [1, 5] to reﬂect the special stabil-
ity of certain sizes. Comparisons with the theoretical pre-
dictions of the ‘Thomson atom’ [27] were also carried out
[6]. Shell eﬀects were more generally investigated semi-
analytically by Koulakov and Shklovskii [11]. Metastable
conﬁgurations (excited states) and the potential energy
barriers between them have been studied in Refs. [4], [12],
[15] and [34]. Topological defects were also identiﬁed for
stable structures [13].

Melting in 2D Coulomb clusters has been a subject of
debate. The results of the classical and quantum Monte
Carlo simulations of Lozovik and Mandelshtam [2] were
interpreted as a two-step melting process, where orien-
tational melting occurs prior to radial melting. In this
process, shells remain quasi-crystalline, but still undergo
some concerted rotational motion. Radial melting con-
versely involves exchanges between particles of adjacent
shells. This two-step process is generally accepted for
small assemblies, but it is not clear whether, in large
clusters, the external shell may also exhibit orientational
melting [12] or not [9].

Several factors are likely to inﬂuence the stability of 2D
Coulomb clusters. First, rotational barriers are strongly
dependent on the structure, which in turn depends on the
size. More stable structures are obtained when the core
is based on a triangular lattice, thus resembling most
observed Wigner crystals. More importantly, the very
diﬀerent nature of orientational and radial melting has
led to some confusion about how suitable observables
should be deﬁned to probe these processes separately
[14, 28, 29]. In their study of binary 2D clusters, Drocco
et al. [16] chose an order parameter based on the polar
angles of the particles in order to quantify the extent
of orientational motion in Langevin molecular dynamics
simulations. However, this measure becomes impractical
as soon as a central particle is present, as it then becomes
very noisy.

Melting in atomic and molecular clusters also dis-
plays a very rich phenomenology [30]. In particular, sur-
face melting [31], plastic transitions [32] or anomalously
high melting temperatures [33] have been identiﬁed
from experiments or simulations. For three-dimensional
trapped-ion clusters, the structures are sometimes re-
lated to those found in atomic clusters [34]. The study of
atomic clusters also shares with Coulomb assemblies the
lack of a proper universal order parameter to characterise
the melting point. For instance, the Lindemann criterion
for melting does not always provide useful information in
the case of solid-solid transitions and premelting eﬀects
[35].

The largest Lyapunov exponent λ, which quantiﬁes
chaos and the sensitivity to initial conditions, is a use-
ful tool for probing the complex dynamics of atomic and
molecular clusters [36, 37, 38, 39, 40], especially at melt-
ing. Because Lyapunov exponents are related to the sec-
ond derivatives of the potential energy surface (PES) [41],
we expect them to be sensitive to orientational melting.

In this paper, we revisit the dynamics and thermody-
namics of 2D Coulomb clusters by focusing on dynamical
measures such as λ or the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, D, and by
performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations employing
the parallel tempering strategy [42]. We also consider the
interplay between the dynamics and the energy landscape
of these clusters by constructing disconnectivity graphs
[43, 44]. Finally, we investigate how the thermodynamic
behaviour evolves with size.

This article is organised as follows. After brieﬂy pre-
senting our methods, we choose some speciﬁc examples
to illustrate the diﬃculties associated with an unambigu-
ous deﬁnition of the melting point in these clusters, and
we then discuss the large size variations. We ﬁnally sum-
marise and conclude in Section IV.

2D Wigner clusters are characterised by the following

classical potential energy:

i .

(1)

In this equation, {qi} = 1 or 2 are the charges carried
by the particles, rij is the distance between particles i
and j, and ri is the distance from particle i to the clus-
ter centre-of-mass. The parameter p will usually be 1
(Coulomb case), but we also speciﬁcally studied the case
p = 3 (dipolar interaction) for which some results will
be selected below. The range of the electrostatic po-
tential, κ, was set to 0 (pure Coulomb) or to a ﬁnite
value (shielded Coulomb). Finally, and for comparison
with the work reported in Ref. 16 on binary clusters,
we have taken A = 10.
in
the absence of the exponential term, the physics of the
system is independent of A: under the transformation
(r, E) → (rA1/(2+p), E/Ap/(2+p)), the energy can be cast
in a form that does not depend on A. In the following
presentation, unit masses and charges are used and all
properties are explicitly given in dimensionless reduced
units.

It should be noted that,

The global minima of the clusters were investigated
using the Monte Carlo plus minimization algorithm, also
known as basin-hopping [45, 46]. The 2D clusters can
generally be described as multishell systems, and we will
use the (n1, n2...) notation for a homogeneous cluster
having ni particles in its ith shell. Binary clusters will
be referred to as {Ns, Nd}, where Ns and Nd are the
respective numbers of singly- and doubly-charged parti-
cles. Due to the relatively long range of the potential
[47], global optimisation is relatively straightforward for
Coulomb systems.

Beyond the stable isomers, we also investigated higher-
index stationary points on the energy landscape. Locat-
ing the saddle points with Hessian index one enabled us
to construct disconnectivity graphs [47], in order to relate
the observed dynamical and thermodynamical behaviour
to the potential energy surface for these clusters. We
refer the reader to Ref. 47 for further details of how sta-
tionary points are located and disconnectivity graphs are
generated.

The dynamics has also been studied by solving Hamil-
ton’s equations of motion at constant energy. The cou-
pled equations were integrated by the 4-step Runge-
Kutta method, which keeps the energy constant to at
least seven digits. For the ﬁrst trajectory, the initial
positions of the particles were obtained from the global
minimum structure and a random set of momenta were
chosen. The momenta were then scaled to set the lin-
ear and angular momentum to zero and the vibrational
temperature to around 10−7. The time step was taken
to be 0.0025. The ﬁrst 105 steps were used to equili-
brate the system and discarded, then 106 steps were used

for each simulation. Further trajectories start with the
conﬁguration obtained from the previous run, with ve-
locities scaled approximately to give a new temperature
increased by a factor 1.25. Again, the equilibration steps
were discarded.

For each trajectory the average kinetic temperature,
root-mean-square (RMS) bond length ﬂuctuation index
δ, the maximal Lyapunov exponent, λ, (MLE) and diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient, D, were calculated. δ is commonly used
to detect melting in bulk or ﬁnite (3D) atomic systems,
as it is expected to jump from a low value to around 0.1–
0.15. Both the diﬀusion coeﬃcient and the Lyapunov
exponent were calculated from shorter parts of the entire
trajectory. D was obtained from the slope of the mean
square atomic displacement. This measure describes the
breathing and inter-shell exchanges (isomerizations), but
does not identify even qualitative changes in the rota-
tional structure. For homogeneous systems it is very dif-
ﬁcult to deﬁne measures of the angular motion. Since
the total angular momentum is zero, one can only mea-
sure angular velocity and momenta for separate shells;
however, the shell deﬁnitions lose their signiﬁcance once
In addition, the an-
isomerizations start taking place.
gular properties become ill-deﬁned for clusters having a
central particle.

The calculation of the MLE was motivated by sev-
eral studies indicating possible relations between phase
changes and this dynamical indicator. The MLE mea-
sures the sensitive dependence on initial conditions and
is deﬁned from the exponential separation of two tra-
jectories that start inﬁnitesimally close together in the
phase space. A tangent space approach was used in the
numerical calculations [48]. However, we should mention
that semi-analytical theories have also been proposed to
quantify the MLE from the statistical properties of the
potential energy surface [49].

The equilibrium thermodynamics of the 2D clusters
was also studied by means of parallel tempering Monte
Carlo (MC) simulations. Parallel tempering is a par-
ticularly eﬃcient method to accelerate convergence in
systems whose natural dynamics is aﬀected by broken
ergodicity. Most often such problems are related to mul-
tiple funnels [47] or ‘glassy’ energy landscapes. The MC
simulations were performed in the canonical ensemble,
with temperatures in the range 10−5 < T < 10. About
80 runs were carried out in this range, with the tem-
peratures nearly equally spaced on a logarithmic scale.
105 MC cycles were used for equilibration, followed by
106 MC cycles for the actual calculations. The MC cal-
culations were principally used to compute the thermal
properties, such as the heat capacity, Cv.

III. RESULTS

3

The snapshots obtained from experiments on colloidal
particles [19] or dust plasmas [20, 21], as well as the vari-
ous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, exhibit three
types of characteristic motion. At low energy or tem-
perature, or for dust plasmas under high pressures, only
small amplitude motion is observed, in which the parti-
cles oscillate around their mean positions. As the energy
increases, these oscillations gain enough momentum to
achieve complete rotations in their respective shells. The
directions of these rotations are random, and they may
change in time. However, in order to preserve the total
angular momentum, diﬀerent shells must rotate in op-
posite directions. Eventually, actual isomerizations be-
tween shells may take place, as previously examined in
3D systems [34]. In one case, it has also been reported
that isomerizations may occur before the full rotational
motion is achieved [20]. We expect this observation to
be due to rather infrequent sampling of the experimen-
tal trajectories [20]. It is clear that the angular and the
radial motion of particles make diﬀerent contributions to
all the measures aforementioned.

In both MC and MD simulations the relation between

the energy and the temperature is quasi linear.

In order to study the mechanism of phase transitions
in 2D clusters, we have carried out simulations of homo-

geneous clusters systems in the size range 3 ≤ n ≤ 40.
We selected several sizes displaying diﬀerent but typical
characteristics. In Fig. 1, λ, D, δ and Cv are plotted with
respect to the average temperature for sizes 17, 21, 22 and
30. The global minima for these clusters are found to
be (1,6,10), (1,7,13), (2,8,12) and (5,10,15), respectively,
in agreement with Ref. 3. The MLE starts becoming
nonzero at very low temperatures, around T = 10−4. In
this regime, the dynamics are more irregular for n = 17
and 21. Similarly, the Lindemann index and the diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients are also higher for n = 17 and 21 in the
low T regime. Both these clusters exhibit an interme-
diate phase over a broad temperature range (note the
logarithmic temperature scale). On the other hand, the
30-particle cluster exhibits a single phase transition.

While the three dynamical indicators agree with one
another, the heat capacities provide rather little infor-
mation in comparison. The general behaviour observed
for all sizes is that of harmonic oscillators at very low
temperatures (Cv → (2n − 3)kB) or for free, indepen-
dent particles at high temperatures (Cv → (2n − 3)kB
again due to conﬁnement). In the intermediate temper-
ature range, a strong decrease is seen near T ∼ 2 for all
sizes, following an order-disorder peak below T = 0.1.
The curves for a speciﬁc cluster are built on the basis of
this generic behaviour, which reminds us of the caloric
curves computed for Lennard-Jones polymers [50]. For
some sizes, such as n = 21 or 30, extra bumps or shoul-
ders occur as a consequence of isomerizations. In general,
the strong increase of λ, D or δ at T ≃ 0.03 correlates
with a peak in the speciﬁc heat. However, the phenom-
ena responsible for the peculiar dynamical features for
the 17- and 21-particle clusters do not have any thermal
signature. The premelting heat capacity peak seen for
n = 21 at T = 0.01 does not have any counterpart in the
dynamical indices either.

These data can be interpreted using the disconnectiv-
ity graphs shown in Fig. 2. In this ﬁgure, saddles con-
necting two permutations of the same isomers have been
included to account for the rotational barriers. Such sad-
dles are manifested by the presence of ’copies’ of the cor-
responding minima on the graph.

The energy barriers, which link the global minimum
to itself through an internal rotation, are much lower for
n = 17 (∆E = 4 × 10−6) and n = 21 (∆E = 10−9, this
is nearly a case of free rotation) than for larger clusters,
where they are closer to ∆E = 10−3. Such degenerate
rearrangements [47] do not play a major role in thermal
equilibrium, but can have important dynamical conse-
quences. This is precisely what we observe in Fig. 1.
The barriers for rearrangements are much higher in en-
ergy than those involved in the rotational motion, but in
some cases other stable isomers lie relatively close to the
global minimum. For n = 21 and n = 30, such isomer-
izations are indeed seen and correlate with bumps in the
canonical heat capacity.

¿From the previous results it is clear that one cannot
draw general conclusions by looking at dynamical indi-

4

cators alone, or at observables aimed at characterising
thermal equilibrium. We have also looked at two speciﬁc
cluster sizes, for which the results of the pure Coulomb
case have been compared to other interaction forms. The
31-particle cluster was studied with both 1/r and 1/r3 in-
teractions, the latter expression being more relevant to
colloidal particles, such as the ones involved in the ex-
perimental setup of Ref. 19. The 42-particle cluster has
recently been the focus of an experimental report on dust
plasmas [21]. In this situation, a screened Coulomb or
Yukawa form e−κr/r is more appropriate than the bare
Coulomb law. Here we chose κ = 1, but the results pre-
sented hereafter in Fig. 3 are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
for other values in the range 0.1 ≤ κ ≤ 10.

We ﬁrst discuss the 31-particle clusters, which display
diﬀerent behaviour depending on the form of the inter-
action. While the Coulomb potential leads to a (5,11,15)
3-shell global minimum, the shorter range dipolar inter-
action favours a (1,5,10,15) ground state. Because this
structure has a central particle, the vibrational motion is
more constrained, and the harmonic entropy of (5,11,15)
is actually larger. This competition between energy and
entropy leads to a structural transition, which is seen
in the heat capacity of Fig. 3(a) as a signiﬁcant peak
near T = 0.03, while the melting peak is located at
T ∼ 0.5. The Coulomb cluster behaves very diﬀerently,
with a single Cv peak at T = 0.03. Scrutiny of the Lin-
demann index indicates that this cluster undergoes free
internal rotation at very low temperatures T < 10−4,
before fully melting at T = 0.03. In the case of the dipo-
lar interaction, only a single, but very sharp, increase is
seen, at temperatures even higher than the melting peak,
T ∼ 0.1. This surprising result has been checked and con-
ﬁrmed by extensive sampling. After regular quenching of
the MD trajectories in this temperature range, we found
that the sharp increase of δ was correlated with a sudden
isomerization to the (5,11,15) second-lowest minimum,
which is also involved in the preliminary structural tran-
sition. The lowest energy transition state from the global
minimum was found to be signiﬁcantly higher than the
energy of the second isomer. In such a situation, MD sim-
ulations suﬀer from broken ergodicity, since they cannot
sample the available phase space until suﬃcient energy
is added. In cluster physics, a well-studied example of
broken ergodicity is provided by the 38-atom Lennard-
Jones cluster [51, 52]. The present sharp jump of the
Lindemann index should not be interpreted as the onset
of melting, but rather as a signature of isomerization.

42-particle clusters were investigated with the aim of
ﬁnding some thermodynamic conﬁrmation that melting
proceeds in multiple steps. Unfortunately, neither the
speciﬁc heats of Fig. 3(b) nor the Lindemann indices of
Fig. 3(d) show any multiple-stage behaviour that could
be related to the experimental observation [21]. We thus
conclude that the dust plasma system studied by Melzer
and coworkers cannot be simply modelled as if it were
made of a single layer.

and Yukawa potentials also provides useful information
about the factors inﬂuencing the melting point. Yukawa
systems exhibit a signiﬁcant shift of their melting tem-
perature toward lower T . Since the Yukawa potential is
an attenuated form of the pure Coulomb form, this is the
expected trend. At large distances, the dipolar interac-
tion is also much smaller than the Coulomb interaction.
However, the melting temperature of Coulomb clusters
is about one order of magnitude smaller than for the
dipolar cluster. Hence the long-range part of the poten-
tial plays opposite roles in the dipolar and Yukawa forms.
This result suggests that the location of the melting peak
is mainly driven by the short-range repulsive part of the
potential.

We now turn to small, binary Coulomb clusters, such
as those recently investigated by Drocco and coworkers
[16]. Ns particles with charge 1 and Nd particles with
charge 2 are stabilised in a parabolic trap with A = 10.
The structures again consist of concentric shells where
the singly charged particles form the inner shells in or-
der to minimize repulsion. Drocco et al. used Langevin
MD simulations for mixed clusters containing Ns = 3–34
singly charged and Nd = 5, 6 and 7 doubly charged parti-
cles, and they also determined the melting points. These
authors concluded that the melting behaviour of these bi-
nary trapped particles strongly depends on whether the
numbers of particles in the inner and outer shells are
commensurate. They also found that the highest melt-
ing points were obtained for Ns = Nd + 1, where the
corresponding structures all have a single particle at the
centre.

We have performed MD simulations for these hetero-
geneous systems under similar conditions to those of the
homogeneous clusters. In Fig. 4, λ, D, δ and the spe-

ciﬁc heat Cv are plotted for {4,5}, {5,5}, {6,5} and
{7,5}, selected as further typical examples, highlight-
ing diﬀerences in the stability and dynamics. The on-
set of chaos occurs at temperatures close to those seen
{6,5} is the most sta-
in the homogeneous systems.
ble cluster, in the sense that it has the highest melt-
ing point in Ref. 16, while {5,5} is the most irregular.
Both the diﬀusion and Lindemann indices show the same
qualitative trends, namely that the melting points, as
measured by the strong increase in δ, follow the order
{4, 5} < {7, 5} < {5, 5} < {6, 5}.

As for homogeneous clusters, the variation of the heat
capacities does not exactly match the dynamical indices.
Here the generic shape again starts at a constant value
at low temperature, which corresponds to harmonic be-
haviour. The high temperature gas phase is still char-
acterised by the same constant value.
In the interme-
diate temperature range, two main peaks are associated
with the melting of successive subclusters made of singly
charged, then doubly charged particles. Nearly one order
of magnitude separates the two associated melting tem-
peratures. This interpretation was further conﬁrmed by
calculating the heat capacity of the ternary {7,6,6} clus-
ter made of 7 singly charged particles, 6 doubly and 6
triply charged particles. For this cluster, three clear fea-
tures are observed in Cv, and only above T ∼ 2 do the
triply charged particles mix with the rest of the cluster.
On top of this generic behaviour, a speciﬁc isomeriza-
tion shoulder is seen for the heat capacity of the {7,5}
cluster in Fig. 4(d), at the same temperature T ≃ 0.01
where the three dynamical parameters increase signiﬁ-
cantly. Again, the free rotation of some internal shells
revealed by λ, D and δ at low temperature has no ther-
mal signature. The disconnectivity graphs for these clus-

ters are shown in Fig. 5. As is particularly obvious from
the graphs for {5,5} and {6,5}, commensurate structure
between the singly- and doubly-charged shells is not the
only factor needed to explain the complicated behaviour
exhibited by these ﬁnite Wigner crystals. The extremely
low barriers for the {4,5} and {5,5} clusters permit facile
rotation, which is correlated with the rapid increase of
all dynamical indicators at low temperatures. The {6,5}
cluster is especially resistant to isomerization because an
extra, central particle hinders the radial motion of the
particles in the other shells. Only for the {7,5} cluster
is the isomerization energy low enough to give rise to
an extra peak in the heat capacity. This case, and the
case of the single-isomer {6,5} cluster, further show that
the multiple-peak structure of the heat capacity is not
a consequence of isomerizations. Therefore the general,
two-peak shape of the heat capacity is not related to iso-
merization, but is intrinsic to the potential itself and the
presence of two types of particles organised in shells.

The variation of the melting temperature with cluster
size is shown in Fig. 6 for the three {n,4}, {n,5} and
{n,6} binary series, with 2 ≤ n ≤ 20. Here the melt-
ing temperature was deﬁned according to the Lindemann
criterion, as the temperature where δ sharply increases
above 0.1. The variation of the computed melting point
is qualitatively similar to that reported by Drocco and

coworkers [16]. In particular, the high values for {4,4},
{5,5}, {6,5} and {7,6} are reproduced. However, our re-
sults quantitatively diﬀer from those of Drocco et al. by
a factor of at least 10. Our data, obtained with exactly
the same Hamiltonian as in Ref. 16, are in agreement
with the computed melting points for the homogeneous
clusters, which are comparable with previous results for
the same systems [3]. Even though the present temper-
atures result from time averages in our MD simulations,
their range matches the canonical temperature of our MC
runs. Hence we believe that the data of Fig. 6 are reli-
able, and that the diﬀerences from the results obtained
by Drocco and coworkers are the consequence of an un-
reported alternative choice of A in the Hamiltonian used
in Ref. [16].

Lastly, we discuss the behaviour of larger clusters and
how melting evolves toward bulk. In Fig. 7(a) we show
the heat capacities calculated from MC simulations for
the cluster sizes n = 100, 200, and 500. The general
trend is that the main peak near T ≃ 0.04 becomes nar-
rower and sharper, suggesting that melting is a ﬁrst-order
process rounded by ﬁnite size eﬀects [53]. However, the
main heat capacity peak remains quite broad, so a more
detailed study should probably be performed on even
larger sizes, including a proper ﬁnite-size scaling anal-

ysis. In addition, extra features in the heat capacity are
present at low temperatures, even for the largest 500-
particle cluster. Regular quenching conﬁrms that these
premelting eﬀects are due to isomerizations involving dif-
ferent arrangements of the inner shells. At large sizes,
even though the global shape of the cluster is roughly
circular, the radial ordering into shells is replaced by a
triangular close-packed lattice, possibly with several de-
fects [13]. Rotation of the various shells then becomes
hindered, and the dynamics is reduced to more usual con-
secutive isomerizations.

Fig. 7(a) supports the idea that a single, ﬁrst-order
phase transition should occur in the bulk limit, if it could
be deﬁned. Since that there is no uniﬁed theory of 2D

melting [54], we should probably be cautious in extrap-
olating the heat capacities computed from Monte Carlo
simulations. If we choose the peak of the heat capacity as
the signature of melting, the melting point thus deﬁned
shows very pronounced variations with the cluster radius
n1/2, as illustrated in ﬁg. 7(b).

The data for all sizes in the range 5 ≤ n ≤ 50 and
for larger clusters (n = 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160,
180, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500) are included in this
graph. The strong size dependence for small systems is
similar to that observed for the binary systems. However,
in the range 50–500 the variation of the melting point
seems less drastic than in the smaller size range, even
though numerous sizes are obviously missing from the
reported data. The bulk limit for the melting point is
obtained to be 0.039.

This observation should not obscure the possibility

that even large sizes can exhibit a multiple stage melt-
ing. For example, signiﬁcant premelting peaks have been
reported in large atomic clusters [55]. The results ob-
tained for n = 500 show a similar feature. Even though
some premelting peaks are present in the caloric curves
of large clusters, a major peak seems to dominate above
about 100 ions. This result may suggest that the tran-
sition between the ﬁnite size regime and bulk [35] takes
place near this size.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this work, we have investigated some dynamic and
thermodynamic properties of ﬁnite 2D charged particles
conﬁned by a parabolic trap. Our extensive data on
homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters were obtained
from MD and MC simulations. These data were inter-
preted by visualising the energy landscape through dis-
connectivity graphs. Previous experimental and numeri-
cal ﬁndings suggest that there are three types of motion
for a particle: it can oscillate, rotate in a relatively regu-
lar orbit, or make jumps between shells, possibly causing
isomerizations. These various phenomena were also ob-
served in the present work, but we found evidence that
additional ‘premelting’ events due to structural transi-
tions may also occur. The various stages of melting cre-
ate ambiguities in deﬁning the melting point, especially
in small clusters.

Firstly, rotational motion is facile when very small en-
ergy barriers separate the global energy minimum from
itself, as is apparent from the disconnectivity graphs
for the 17- and 21-particle homogeneous clusters, or the
{4,5} binary cluster. Internal rotation may give rise to
signiﬁcant jumps in the RMS bond length ﬂuctuation,
sometimes above 0.1. Radial melting is then seen as
yet another increase in δ or other dynamical indicators
at higher energy. Therefore, the Lindemann criterion
(δ >
∼ 0.1) is not fully reliable for detecting melting.
Secondly, rotational melting has no thermodynamic
consequence since only a single isomer is involved. The
thermodynamics is sensitive to the presence of diﬀerent
isomers, and also to the intrinsic shape of the potential
felt by the particles. Irrespective of the isomers, the heat
capacity has a natural drop over a rather broad tempera-
ture range, which marks the continuous transition toward
the gas phase. Hence, even a single cluster isomer can
have heat capacities with complex temperature depen-
dence, as exempliﬁed by the small {4,5} binary clusters.
Thirdly, several isomers can give rise to preliminary
peaks in the heat capacity, which may sometimes ob-
scure the features associated with full radial melting.
We found such a case for the 31-particle cluster inter-
acting through dipolar forces, but very large clusters can
also exhibit particularly strong premelting peaks. The
structural transition occurring in the 31-particle clus-
ter has the same origins as the fcc-icosahedral transition
in the 3D 38-atom Lennard-Jones cluster [51, 52]: the

8

second morphology has a much larger entropy than the
global minimum. This phenomenon has important con-
sequences for the constant energy dynamical behaviour,
as this transition is not seen until suﬃcient energy to sur-
mount the isomerization barrier is present. Thus there
is a ﬁnite energy range where MD simulations starting
from the ground state structure are non-ergodic, which
is reﬂected by a strong shift in the estimated melting
temperature.

Most of our results illustrate how a simple and unique
picture of melting is hampered by ﬁnite size eﬀects.
Both the dynamical parameters and the thermodynami-
cal curves contribute to explaining related but diﬀerent
aspects of melting in these 2D clusters. In particular, our
work does not support a single parameter as a universal
measure for the melting point that could be used unam-
biguously for all clusters. Nevertheless, the landscape
approach [47] that has been followed here was found to
provide useful insight for interpreting and understanding
the various numerical data.

The data gathered here for a broad range of sizes
would seem to prevent a general classiﬁcation on the
phenomenology of melting to be made.
For exam-
ple, the choice of molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo
method, and the microcanonical or canonical ensemble,
can change the observed behavior signiﬁcantly, particu-
larly at small sizes where the diﬀerences between the two
statistical ensembles are the largest. For instance, some
structural transitions might not appear with conventional
MD methods, due to the disconnected character of phase
space at low total energies.

However, three main categories of behavior can be in-
ferred from our results. Especially in small clusters, a
two-step orientational-then-radial melting has been ob-
served, with clear dynamical signatures, but only a weak
thermodynamical signature. Clusters exhibiting struc-
tural transitions, on the other hand, may not involve any
rotational melting but display a strong change in their
caloric curve. Finally, a more conventional single-step
melting is sometimes seen, as expected in larger clusters,
and also for smaller ’magic’ sizes.

Our calculations indicate that signiﬁcant ﬁnite size ef-
fects remain in the thermodynamics of the largest clusters
considered. However, above a few hundred ions, melting
seems to be essentially a one-step process. This result
is consistent with the expectation that the dynamics be-
comes more and more dominated by localised processes,
due to the less favourable rotational motion. This obser-
vation seems to justify the use of the Lindemann index
or other dynamical parameters for larger systems. Ad-
ditionally, the main heat capacity peak becomes larger,
and its maximum value coincides with the onset of dis-
order in the dynamical indicators. Even though premelt-
ing features may remain noticeable, we expect the onset
of radial melting to become closer and closer to orienta-
tional melting, and eventually similar to a bulk ﬁrst-order
melting process.

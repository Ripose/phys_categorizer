Melting behavior of large disordered sodium clusters.

Departamento de F´ısica Te´orica, Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid 47011, Spain

Andr´es Aguado

The melting-like transition in disordered sodium clusters NaN , with N=92 and 142 is studied
by using a ﬁrst-principles constant-energy molecular dynamics simulation method. Na142, whose
atoms are distributed in two (surface and inner) main shells with diﬀerent radial distances to the
center of mass of the cluster, melts in two steps: the ﬁrst one, at ≈ 130 K, is characterized by a
high intrashell mobility of the atoms, and the second, homogeneous melting, at ≈ 270 K, involves
diﬀusive motion of all the atoms across the whole cluster volume (both intrashell and intershell
displacements are allowed). On the contrary, the melting of Na92 proceeds gradually over a very
wide temperature interval, without any abrupt step visible in the thermal or structural melting
indicators. The occurrence of well deﬁned steps in the melting transition is then shown to be related
to the existence of a distribution of the atoms in shells. Thereby we propose a necessary condition
for a cluster to be considered rigorously amorphouslike (totally disordered), namely that there are
no space regions of the cluster where the local value of the atomic density is considerably reduced.
Na92 is the only cluster from the two considered that veriﬁes this condition, so its thermal behavior
can be considered as representative of that expected for amorphous clusters. Na142, on the other
hand, has a discernible atomic shell structure and should be considered instead as just partially
disordered. The thermal behavior of these two clusters is also compared to that of icosahedral
(totally ordered) sodium clusters of the same sizes.

I. INTRODUCTION

Cluster melting is a topic of current theoretical1–7 and
experimental8–11 interest, motivated by the observation
of several size-dependent properties which have no ana-
log in the bulk phase. Between those properties, we can
mention the following: (i) the melting like transition does
not occur at a well deﬁned temperature as in the solid,
but spreads over a ﬁnite temperature interval that widens
as the cluster size decreases. The lower end of that in-
terval deﬁnes the freezing temperature Tf below which
the cluster is completely solidlike, their constituent atoms
just vibrating about their equilibrium positions. The up-
per part of the interval deﬁnes the melting temperature
above which all the atoms can diﬀuse across the clus-
ter and the “liquid” phase is completely established. Be-
tween those two temperatures the cluster is not fully solid
nor fully liquid.12 It is in that transition region where the
cluster-speciﬁc behavior emerges: (ia) Premelting eﬀects
like partial melting of the cluster (the most usual case
is surface melting)13 or structural isomerizations upon
heating, which lead to a melting in steps.14 (ib) The dy-
namic coexistence regime, where the cluster can ﬂuctu-
ate in time between being completely solid or liquid.15
(ii) Strong nonmonotonic variations of the melting tem-
perature with size have been found in recent experiments
on sodium clusters.9 The maxima in the melting temper-
ature are not in exact correspondence with either elec-
tronic or atomic shell closing numbers, but bracketed by
the two, suggesting that both eﬀects are relevant to the
melting process. It is important to note that the values
of Tf and Tm as deﬁned above are not yet amenable

to the experiments, and that the experimental melting
temperature is somewhere between these two values.

Previously6,7 we have reported density functional
orbital-free molecular dynamics (OFMD) simulations
of the melting process in sodium clusters NaN , with
N=8,20,55,92, and 142. The OFMD technique16 is com-
pletely analogous to the method devised by Car and
Parrinello (CP) to perform dynamic simulations at an
ab initio level,17 but the electron density is taken as
the dynamic variable,18 as opposed to the Kohn-Sham
(KS) orbitals19 in the original CP method. This tech-
nique has been already used both in solid state20,21 and
cluster2,22,23 physics.
In contrast to simulations which
use empirical interatomic potentials, the detailed elec-
tronic structure and the electronic contribution to the
energy and the forces on the ions are recalculated eﬃ-
ciently every atomic time-step. The main advantage over
KS-based methods is that the computational eﬀort to
update the electronic system increases linearly with the
cluster size N, in contrast to the N3 scaling of orbital-
based methods.
Indeed, these were the ﬁrst molecular
dynamics simulations of large clusters as Na92 and Na142
that included an explicit treatment of the electronic de-
grees of freedom.

A very important issue in the simulations of cluster
melting is the election of the low-temperature isomer to
be heated. A good knowledge of the ground state struc-
ture (global minimum) is required, as the details of the
melting transition are known to be isomer-dependent.24
But the problem of performing a realistic global optimiza-
tion search is exponentially diﬃcult as size increases, so
ﬁnding the global minima of Na92 and Na142 becomes im-

1

practical. In our previous work7 we directly started from
icosahedral isomers, as there is some experimental8 and
theoretical25 indications that suggest icosahedral packing
in sodium clusters, and found a good agreement with the
experimental results of Haberland’s group.9 However, we
were unable to ﬁnd those icosahedral structures by an un-
constrained search method as simulated annealing, which
always led to disordered isomers both for Na92 and Na142.
Although the icosahedral structures are more stable in all
the cases, the energy diﬀerence between both isomers is
approximately 0.02 eV/atom, which is very small. Amor-
phouslike structures have been found recently to be the
ground state isomers of gold clusters for a number of
sizes,26,27 and pair potential calculations performed by
Doye and Wales predict that the amorphous state is fa-
vored by long potential ranges.28 The speciﬁc features
of those structures are little or no spatial symmetry and
a pair distribution function typical of glasses. Besides
that, one usually ﬁnds a large number of amorphouslike
isomers nearly degenerate in energy, which suggests that
they occupy a substantial fraction of the phase space
available to the cluster. Both the energy proximity to
the more stable icosahedral isomers and the large en-
tropy associated with the amorphous part of the phase
space make plausible that amorphous isomers could be
present in the experimental cluster beams, so their ther-
mal properties deserve speciﬁc investigation. Apart from
this, the study of melting in amorphouslike clusters is
intrinsically interesting from a theoretical point of view.
Thus, the goals of this work are to study the mecha-
nisms by which the melting-like transition proceeds in
two disordered isomers of Na92 and Na142, to study the
inﬂuence on the melting behavior of the disorder degree,
and to make a meaningful comparison with the melting
behavior of the corresponding icosahedral isomers. In the
next section we brieﬂy present some technical details of
the method. The results are presented and discussed in
section III and, ﬁnally, section IV summarizes our main
conclusions.

II. THEORY

The orbital-free molecular dynamics method is a Car-
Parrinello total energy scheme17 which uses an explicit
kinetic-energy functional of the electron density, and has
the electron density as the dynamical variable, as op-
posed to the KS single particle wavefunctions. The
main features of the energy functional and the calcula-
tion scheme have been described at length in previous
work,16,22,2,6 and details of our method are as described
by Aguado et al.6 In brief, the electronic kinetic energy
functional of the electron density, n(~r), corresponds to
the gradient expansion around the homogeneous limit
through second order18,29–31

The local density approximation is used for exchange and
correlation.32,33 In the external ﬁeld acting on the elec-

trons, Vext(~r) = Pn v(~r − ~Rn), we take v to be the lo-

cal pseudopotential of Fiolhais et al.,34 which reproduces
well the properties of bulk sodium and has been shown
to have good transferability to sodium clusters.35 The
cluster is placed in a unit cell of a cubic superlattice, and
the set of plane waves periodic in the superlattice is used
as a basis set to expand the valence density. Following
Car and Parrinello,17 the coeﬃcients of that expansion
are regarded as generalized coordinates of a set of ﬁcti-
tious classical particles, and the corresponding Lagrange
equations of motion for the ions and the electron density
distribution are solved as described in Ref. 6.

The calculations used a supercell of edge 71 a.u. and
the energy cut-oﬀ in the plane wave expansion of the den-
sity was 8 Ryd. In all cases, a 64×64×64 grid was used.
Previous tests6,7 indicate that the cut-oﬀs used give good
convergence of bond lengths and binding energies. The
ﬁctitious mass associated with the electron density coef-
ﬁcients ranged between 1.0×108 and 3.3×108 a.u., and
the equations of motion were integrated using the Verlet
algorithm36 for both electrons and ions with a time step
ranging from ∆t = 0.73 × 10−15 sec. for the simulations
performed at the lowest temperatures, to ∆t = 0.34 ×
10−15 sec. for those at the highest ones. These choices
resulted in a conservation of the total energy better than
0.1 %.

Several molecular dynamics simulation runs at diﬀer-
ent constant energies were performed in order to obtain
the caloric curve for each cluster. The initial positions
of the atoms for the ﬁrst run were taken by slightly de-
forming the equilibrium low temperature geometry of the
cluster. The ﬁnal conﬁguration of each run served as the
starting geometry for the next run at a diﬀerent energy.
The initial velocities for every new run were obtained by
scaling the ﬁnal velocities of the preceding run. The total
simulation times varied between 8 and 18 ps for each run
at constant energy.

A number of indicators to locate the melting-like tran-
sition were employed. Namely, the speciﬁc heat deﬁned

III. RESULTS

The most stable disordered structures of Na92 and
Na142 that we have found with the simulated annealing
technique are shown in Fig. 1, together with the relaxed
icosahedral isomers obtained as explained in our previous
work.7 The dynamical annealing runs17 were started from
high-temperature liquid isomers thermalized during 30 ps
at 600 K. The cooling strategy was to reduce the inter-
nal cluster temperature by a factor of 0.9999 of its actual
value each twelve atomic time steps. With the chosen
time step of 0.34 × 10−15 sec. the temperature reduction
is applied each four femtoseconds. A ﬁrst important dif-
ference between the icosahedral and disordered isomers
is that the former ones have a smoother surface. Besides
that, no apparent spatial symmetry is observed in the
disordered isomers. In Fig. 2 we show the short-time av-
erages (sta) of the distances between each atom and the
center of mass of the cluster for both isomers of Na142,
obtained from an OFMD run at a low temperature. The
values of < ri(t) >sta are almost independent of time.
The clusters are solid, the atoms merely vibrating around
their equilibrium positions. Curve crossings are due to
oscillatory motion and slight structural relaxations rather
than diﬀusive motion. The diﬀerence between Figs. 2a
and 2b is due to structure. For the icosahedral isomer
in Fig. 2a one can distinguish quasidegenerate groups
which are characteristic of the symmetry: one line near
the center of mass of the cluster identiﬁes the central
atom, whose position does not exactly coincide with the
center of mass because of the location of the ﬁve sur-
face vacancies (147 atoms are needed to form a complete
three-shell icosahedron); 12 lines correspond to the ﬁrst
icosahedral shell; another 42 complete the second shell,

3

within which we can distinguish the 12 vertex atoms from
the rest because their distances to the center of mass are
slightly larger; ﬁnally, 82 lines describe the external shell,
where again we can distinguish the 7 vertex atoms from
the rest. In contrast, the lines for the disordered isomer
in Fig. 2b are quite dispersed. Nevertheless, there is a
narrow interval where the ionic density is very low, that
serves to deﬁne separate surface and inner atomic shells.
The case of Na92 (not shown) is similar, but in that case
the structure is more uniformously amorphous, and there
is no way to distinguish between surface and inner shells.
We will see below that this small diﬀerence is very im-
portant. Soler at al.26,27 have compared the structures
of icosahedral and amorphous gold clusters, with similar
results: while the atoms in the icosahedral isomers are
clearly distributed in atomic shells with diﬀerent radial
distances to the center of mass of the cluster, in the case
of amorphous clusters there are “atomic transfers” be-
tween shells that blur the atomic shell structure. In the
case of gold clusters, the amorphous isomers turn out
to be the minimum energy structures for a number of
sizes.26 In the case of Na92 and Na142, the icosahedral
isomers are more stable than the lowest energy disor-
dered isomers found (0.017 eV/atom and 0.020 eV/atom
for Na92 and Na142 respectively).7

For each cluster we have calculated the internal tem-
perature, deﬁned as the average of the ionic kinetic
energy,37 as a function of the total energy– the so-called
caloric curve. A thermal phase transition is indicated in
the caloric curve by a change of slope, the slope being
the speciﬁc heat; the height of the step gives an estimate
of the latent heat of fusion. However, melting processes
are more easily recognized as peaks in the speciﬁc heat as
a function of temperature, that has been calculated di-
rectly from eq. (4). The fact that the speciﬁc heat peaks
occur at the same temperatures as the slope changes of
the caloric curve (see curves below) gives us conﬁdence
on the convergence of our results, as those two quantities
have been obtained in diﬀerent ways.

s ≈ 130 K and Tdis

The speciﬁc heat curves for Na142 (ﬁg. 3) display two
main peaks, suggestive of a two-step melting process. For
the disordered cluster the two peaks are well separated
in temperature, Tdis
m ≈ 270 K, whereas
they are much closer together for the icosahedral cluster,
Tico
s ≈ 240 K and Tico
m ≈ 270 K, so close that only one
slope change in the caloric curve can be distinguished in
this case. The results suggest that the melting transi-
tion starts at a temperature Ts and ﬁnishes at Tm with
the diﬀerence in the melting of the two isomers being the
smaller Ts value of the disordered isomer. In our previous
work7 we showed that for the icosahedral cluster those
two steps are due to surface melting and homogeneous
melting, respectively. Here we show that a similar expla-
nation is valid for the disordered Na142 isomer. At T=160
K, a temperature between Tdis
m , the structure of
the disordered cluster is more ﬂuid than at low temper-
ature (ﬁg. 2). Fig. 4 indicates that the spherical atomic
shells have separately melted, atoms undergoing diﬀu-

and Tdis

s

sive motions mainly across a given shell, as seen in the
bold lines, without an appreciable intershell diﬀusion (al-
though some occasional intershell displacement has been
observed). The larger spread of the upper bold line in-
dicates that diﬀusion is appreciably faster in the surface
shell. Thus the transition at 130 K can be identiﬁed with
intrashell melting. Why it occurs at a rather low tem-
perature is associated with the large spread in the radial
distances of the atoms in each shell. The atomic shells
are structurally disordered at low temperature, although
kinetically frozen, like in a typical glass, so inducing diﬀu-
sion in the shells of that cluster is rather easy and occurs
at moderate temperatures. The surface melting stage
does not develop in the icosahedral isomer until a tem-
perature of Tico
s ≈ 240 K is reached. At this temperature,
the time evolution of the surface atomic distances to the
cluster center becomes very similar to those of the dis-
ordered Na142 isomer at 160 K.7 Inducing diﬀusion in
the surface of the icosahedral isomer requires a higher
temperature because of the higher structural order of its
surface. Once the surface of both isomers has melted, ho-
mogeneous melting occur at the same temperature, ≈ 270
K, in very good agreement with the experimental value
of 280 K.9 From that temperature on, the liquid phase is
completely established (all atoms can diﬀuse across the
whole cluster volume)7 and diﬀerences between both iso-
mers have no sense anymore.

The thermal behavior of both isomers is not so diﬀer-
ent. The radial atomic density distribution of the disor-
dered isomer at 160 K (Fig. 5) shows a smoothed shape
with respect to that found at low T, but a distribution
of the atoms in separate surface and inner atomic shells
can be clearly distinguished.
In fact, the intermediate
temperature distribution is similar to that found for the
icosahedral isomer in the same temperature region,7 as
the atomic shells are equally distinguished. The small
gap in the ionic density (Figs. 2 and 5) of the disordered
isomer at low temperature drives the cluster towards a
well deﬁned shell structure upon heating. We conclude
that, despite the high orientational disorder in both sur-
face and inner shells, the cluster can not be considered
completely amorphous, as Fig. 5 at intermediate tem-
perature shows some radial atomic ordering. There are
still more similarities. The solidlike phase of the icosahe-
dral isomer disappears as soon as a temperature of 130
K is reached, even though no peak in the speciﬁc heat
is detected: there are isomerization transitions between
diﬀerent permutational isomers which preserve the icosa-
hedral structure.7 These isomerizations involve the dis-
placement of the ﬁve surface vacancies across the outer
shell. Thus, both isomers leave the solidlike phase at ≈
130 K, the only diﬀerence being that one has direct access
to the intrashell melting stage while the other enters ﬁrst
an isomerization regime. Calvo and Spiegelmann5 have
related the appareance of speciﬁc heat peaks to sudden
openings of the available phase space.
In the isomer-
ization regime the icosahedral cluster has access just to
a limited number of symmetry-equivalent isomers, while

the phase structure of the disordered cluster opens sud-
denly to include a very large number of isomers, as all
the possible position interchanges between two atoms of
a given shell are allowed. Thus, a speciﬁc heat peak ap-
pears at T≈130 K for the disordered isomer, but not for
the icosahedral isomer. Any atomic shell distribution in
the time average of g(r) disappears completely when ho-
mogeneous melting occur (Fig. 5).

The results for Na92 are shown in ﬁg. 6. Two-step
melting is again observed in the icosahedral isomer, with
a small prepeak in the speciﬁc heat at Tico
s ≈ 130 K
and a large peak, corresponding to homogeneous melt-
ing, at Tico
m are well
separated. Tico
is in the range where the isomerization
processes in icosahedral Na142 set in and the intrashell
melting stage in disordered Na142 develops. The larger
number of vacancies in the surface shell of icosahedral
Na92, as compared to icosahedral Na142, allows for true
surface diﬀusion and these processes give rise to a dis-
tinct peak in the speciﬁc heat.7 The disordered isomer
melts gradually over a wide temperature interval, and
no prominent speciﬁc heat peaks nor important slope
changes in the caloric curve are detected. Ercolessi et
al.38 have also found a melting process without a latent
heat of fusion for amorphous gold clusters with less than
∼ 90 atoms. In Fig. 7 we show the radial ionic density
distribution of disordered Na92 at several representative
temperatures. At a temperature as low as 70 K there is
no discernible atomic shell structure. The g(r) function
for a higher temperature where the surface of the icosa-
hedral isomer has already melted is not very diﬀerent. At
a temperature where the icosahedral isomer is liquid the
only appreciable change in g(r) is due to the thermal ex-
pansion of the cluster. The structure of cold disordered
Na92 is both radially and orientationally disordered. The
structure is kinetically frozen, but there seems to be no
barriers impeding the exploration of the liquid part of the
phase space. In fact, the cluster is already in that region
at low temperature, as Fig. 7 shows. This is seen most
clearly in the evolution of the diﬀusion behavior with
temperature. In Fig. 8 we show the temperature varia-
tion of the square root of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. While
the two steps in the melting of the icosahedral isomer are
clearly detected as slope changes at the corresponding
temperatures, the value of √D for the disordered isomer
increases with temperature in a smooth way, without any
abrupt change. Thus, the opening of the available phase
space proceeds in a gradual way and speciﬁc heat peaks
are not detected.

We have found a very diﬀerent thermal behavior for
two clusters that were classiﬁed in principle as disor-
dered. Although just two examples are not enough to
draw general conclusions, we believe that the thermal be-
havior typical of amorphouslike sodium clusters is that
found for Na92, and that what is lacking is a clear deﬁ-
nition of what an amorphous cluster is. In line with the
discussion of “atomic transfers” between shells advanced
by Soler et al,27 we propose that a large orientational

4

disorder is not enough for a cluster to be classiﬁed as
amorphouslike. Only when those atomic transfers are
maximal, in such a way that no local regions with low
atomic density exist, the cluster can be considered com-
pletely amorphous. The existence of those regions, how-
ever small they may be (as is the case of Na142), promote
the creation of appreciable free energy barriers in the po-
tential energy surface, so sudden access to a substantial
region of the available phase space is expected above a
certain temperature, and peaks will appear in the tem-
perature evolution of the speciﬁc heat. On the contrary,
the absence of such low atomic density regions facilitates
the diﬀusion of the atoms across the whole cluster volume
right from the start of the heating process. As the liq-
uidlike phase is established precisely when all the atoms
in the cluster can diﬀuse across the cluster volume, we
expect that no appreciable free energy barriers will be
found in these cases, and no speciﬁc heat peaks will be
detected.

A few comments regarding the quality of the simu-
lations and of the annealing runs are perhaps in order
here. The orbital-free representation of the atomic in-
teractions is much more eﬃcient than the more accurate
KS treatments, but is still substantially more expensive
computationally than a simulation using phenomenolog-
ical many-body potentials. Such potentials contain a
number of parameters that are usually chosen by ﬁtting
some bulk and/or molecular properties. In contrast our
model is free of external parameters, although there are
approximations in the kinetic and exchange-correlation
functionals. The orbital-free scheme accounts, albeit ap-
proximately, for the eﬀects of the detailed electronic dis-
tribution on the total energy and the forces on the ions.
We feel that this is particularly important in metallic
clusters for which a large proportion of atoms are on the
surface and experience a very diﬀerent electronic envi-
ronment than an atom in the interior. Furthermore, the
adjustment of the electronic structure and consequently
the energy and forces to rearrangements of the ions is also
taken into account. But the price to be paid for the more
accurate description of the interactions is a less complete
statistical sampling of the phase space. The simulation
times are substantially shorter than those that can be
achieved in phenomenological simulations. The cooling
rate employed in the annealing runs is also faster than
those that can be achieved by using empirical potentials.
Nevertheless, we expect that the locations of the several
transitions are reliable, because all the indicators we have
used, both thermal and structural ones, are in essential
agreement on the temperature at which the transitions
start. On the other hand, the disordered isomers found in
diﬀerent annealing runs did not show substantial struc-
tural or energetic diﬀerences with respect to those studied
here.

IV. SUMMARY

The melting-like transition in disordered Na142 and
Na92 has been investigated by applying an orbital-free,
density-functional molecular dynamics method. The
computational eﬀort which is required is modest in com-
parison with the traditional Car-Parrinello Molecular
Dynamics technique based on Kohn-Sham orbitals, that
would be very costly for clusters of this size. This saving
allows the study of large clusters.

A disordered isomer of Na142 melts in two steps as
evidenced by the thermal
indicators. The transition
at Tdis
s ≈ 130 K is best described as intrashell melt-
ing. This is followed at Tdis
m ≈ 270 K by homogeneous
melting. Melting is found to depend on the starting
low-temperature isomer. Speciﬁcally, for an icosahedral
Na142 isomer, the analysis of thermal, macroscopic prop-
erties places those two stages much closer in temperature,
240 K and 270 K respectively.7 Nevertheless, isomeriza-
tion transitions are observed in the icosahedral isomer
at a temperature as low as Tdis
s ≈130 K. These isomer-
izations involve the motion of the ﬁve atomic vacancies
in the cluster surface, preserve the icosahedral structure
and do not give rise to any pronounced feature in the
caloric curve.
In the disordered isomer there is not a
separate isomerization regime (something rather evident
because there is not an underlying ordered structure in
each shell), but there is a melting-in-steps process, due to
the distribution of the atoms in diﬀerent shells. Thus, the
melting of both isomers is not as diﬀerent as suggested
by the thermal indicators. An icosahedral isomer of Na92
melts also in a similar way: there is a minor peak in Cv at
Tico
s ≈130K that indicates surface melting, and a main,
homogeneous melting peak at Tico
m ≈240 K. The lower
value of Tico
s , as compared to Na142, is due to the larger
number of surface vacancies, and the melting-in-step pro-
cess is due to the atomic shell structure. The melting of
disordered Na92 proceeds instead gradually, and spreads
over a very wide temperature interval. The thermal indi-
cators as the caloric curve or the speciﬁc heat do not show
any indications of an abrupt transition, which suggests
that the phase space available to the cluster does not in-
creases suddenly at any given temperature. The square
root of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient increases with tempera-
ture in a smooth way, in contrast to the step diﬀusive
behavior of icosahedral Na92. It has been suggested that
the absence of any abrupt transition is closely related to
the absence of any shell structure in the radial atomic
density distribution, which should be considered a neces-
sary condition for a cluster to be considered completely
amorphous.
In this, sense, only the disordered isomer
of Na92 can be considered rigorously amorphous, while
the disordered Na142 isomer should be considered just
partially amorphous.

In summary, we have found a number of structural
properties that have an important eﬀect on the melting
properties of sodium clusters. A melting in steps pro-

5

cess is to be expected in almost all clusters where a clear
distribution of the atoms in radial shells exists, as is the
case of both isomers of Na142 and of the icosahedral iso-
mer of Na92. In those cases, intrashell diﬀusive motion
starts at a temperature Tintra, lower than the temper-
ature Tinter at which intershell diﬀusive motion begins
to be important. The diﬀerence Tinter-Tintra is small if
the orientational order of the shells is large (for example,
icosahedral order) and the number of vacancies in each
shell is small: this occurs for icosahedral Na142, with just
ﬁve surface vacancies; A limit case is icosahedral Na55.
With two complete atomic shells, intrashell motions are
as diﬃcult as intershell motions and the two transitions
merge into one.7 When one shell contains a large number
of vacancies, the two temperatures are well separated no
matter how high the orientational order is: this is exem-
pliﬁed by the case of icosahedral Na92. Also, if the shells
have a high orientational disorder, the two transitions
are well separated in temperature no matter how close
we are from an icosahedral shell closing: an example is
the disordered Na142 isomer. Finally, a gradual melting
process without any abrupt transition is to be expected
for all those clusters which have both orientational and
radial disorder, that is for amorphouslike clusters: this is
the case of amorphous Na92.

Captions of Figures.
Figure 1 Structures of the low temperature (a) amor-
phous Na142, (b) icosahedral Na142, (c) amorphous Na92
and (d) icosahedral Na92 isomers.

Figure 2 Short-time averaged distances < ri(t) >sta
between each atom and the center of mass in Na142, as
functions of time for (a) the icosahedral isomer at T= 30
K and (b) the amorphous isomer at T= 47 K.

Figure 3 Caloric and speciﬁc heat curves of Na142,
taking the internal cluster temperature as the indepen-
dent variable. The deviation around the mean tempera-
ture is smaller than the size of the circles.

Figure 4 Short-time averaged distances < ri(t) >sta
between each atom and the center of mass in amorphous
Na142 as functions of time at T= 160 K. The bold lines
follow the evolution of a particular atom in the surface
shell and another in the outermost core shell.

Figure 5 Time averaged radial atomic density distri-
bution of the amorphous isomer of Na142, at some repre-
sentative temperatures.

Figure 6 Caloric and speciﬁc heat curves of Na92, tak-
ing the internal cluster temperature as the independent
variable. The deviation around the mean temperature is
smaller than the size of the circles.

Figure 7 Time averaged radial atomic density distri-
bution of the amorphous isomer of Na92, at some repre-
sentative temperatures.

Figure 8 Square root of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient as a
function of temperature for the icosahedral and amor-
phous isomers of Na92.

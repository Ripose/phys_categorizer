Abstract

The orbital M1 collective mode predicted for deformed clusters in a schematic

model is studied in a self-consistent random-phase-approximation approach

which fully exploits the shell structure of the clusters. The microscopic mech-

anism of the excitation is clariﬁed and the close correlation with E2 mode

established. The study shows that the M1 strength of the mode is frag-

mented over a large energy interval. In spite of that, the fraction remaining

at low energy, well below the overwhelming dipole plasmon resonance, is even

larger than the strength predicted in the schematic model. The importance

of this result in view of future experiments is stressed.

Among the collective excitations which may occur in metal clusters, the magnetic dipole

mode predicted for deformed clusters in a schematic model [1] has unique and appealing

properties which deserve a deeper investigation. This excitation, which is the analogue of

the scissors mode predicted [2] and observed [3] in deformed nuclei, is promoted by a ro-

tational oscillations of the valence electrons against the jellium background. Indeed, in the

semiclassical approach [1], the displacement ﬁeld of the mode is composed of a rigid rota-

tional velocity ﬁeld plus a quadrupole term which comes from the boundary condition that

the velocity ﬂow vanishes on the deformed surface. The distortion of the momentum Fermi

sphere generates a restoring force of the rotational oscillations. The mode is characterized

by the magnetic quantum number K π = 1+ and falls at an excitation energy [1]

show, the M1 mode is peculiar of deformed clusters. Its occurrence would represent a unique

and unambiguous ﬁngerprint for the onset of quadrupole deformation. The main indicator

of the deformation available so far is the splitting of the E1 resonance which, however, is

often washed out or not properly resolved experimentally. The energy formula (1) reveals

another appealing property. The M1 mode falls well below the energy of the overwhelming

E1 resonance and, therefore, has good chances of being detected experimentally. In view

of such a possibility, it is of the utmost importance to test the predictions of the schematic

model by carrying out a microscopic calculation which fully exploits the shell structure of the

clusters. Such a calculation should shed light on the microscopic mechanism which generates

the mode and should reveal, eventually, new properties connected with the shell structure It

certainly will ascertain if and to what extent the M1 strength is fragmented and quenched.

Clearly such a mode can be detected and can be used as a signature for deformation only if

its M1 strength remains concentrated in a reasonably narrow energy range.

We performed our calculation in a self-consistent RPA (SRPA) approach [4–6] which in

the most general formulation [4] is based on the Kohn-Sham functional [7]. Here we skipped

the self-consistent derivation of the one-body potential and adopted the phenomenological

deformed Woods-Saxon well. On the other hand, we determined self-consistently the two-

body potential starting with a set of displacement ﬁelds

fL21, where

∇

fL21 = rL(Y21 + Y ∗

21),

L = 2, 4, 6, 8.

(0.3)

The resulting interaction was a sum of weighted separable terms peaked on diﬀerent slices of

the system. Due to its close link to the detailed structure of the system, such an interaction,

in spite of its separable form, came out to be quite suitable for describing its dynamical

properties. The SRPA fully exploits the shell structure and, as shown for the dipole response

[6], reaches the accuracy of the most reﬁned and complete RPA approaches. Moreover, it

preserves the simplicity of the schematic model [1] which can be easily recovered if an

anisotropic HO potential plus the single operator f221 = r2(Y21 + Y ∗

21) are used.

The choice of a quadrupole-like ﬁeld was motivated by its close connection with the

generator of the rotational oscillation, namely the angular momentum (see [8] and Refs.

therein). Such a link can be easily established for L = 2 in the HO space , where one ﬁnds

shell quantum number). On the other hand, the quadrupole ﬁelds act obviously also in

3

the E2 channel. Consistency requires that both, magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole,

excitations should be treated contextually. It is worth noting that, the choice made for our

displacement ﬁelds (see Eq.0.3) is quite general for our purposes. Indeed, since spin-orbit

coupling in clusters is negligible, the orbital excitations are decoupled from the spin ones,

so that the spin-spin interaction can be safely neglected. The spin-quadrupole ﬁelds can

be also ignored. In the nuclear systems, they are known to aﬀect only the spin channel by

renormalizing the spin-spin interaction.

The parameters of the Woods-Saxon potential VW S = V0/[1 + exp(R(Θ)

r)/a0)] with

−

R(Θ) = R0(β0 + β2Y20(Θ)) and R0 = r0N 1/3 were adjusted so as to reproduce the Kohn-

Sham+SRPA results for the dipole plasmon in spherical sodium clusters [4]. The ﬁt yielded

r0 = 2.5˚A, V0 =

7.2 eV and a0 = 1.25˚A for singly charged clusters and r0 = 2.4˚A,

−

V0 =

5.7 eV and a0 = 1.11˚A for neutral clusters. The values of the deformation parameter

−
45/16πβ2 were extracted from the experimental data [9] (for Ne ≤

34) following

the prescription of Ref. [1], or were taken from the calculations [10] (for Ne > 34). Only

δ =

q

clusters with measured or predicted axial quadrupole deformation were considered. Equal

deformation parameters were used for both charged and neutral clusters. As shown in Ref.

[5], the SRPA calculations with these parameters account well for the observed deformation

splitting of the dipole plasmon in deformed Na clusters.

The most meaningful results of the calculation are presented in Figs. 1-3. In Fig. 1 the

M1 strength distribution is plotted for singly charged clusters varying from N = 15 to 295.

In order to simulate the temperature broadening, we smoothed out the M1 strength with

the Lorentz weight using the averaging parameter ∆ = 0.05 eV. We also gave a quantitative

estimate of the Landau damping by computing the width Γ of the resonance which ideally

envelops all the peaks above a threshold value ﬁxed to be one-half the height of the highest

peak [6]. This deﬁnition yields the standard full width at half maximum (FWHM) in the

simplest case of one-peak structure. The plot shows that, as the size of the cluster increases,

the whole M1 strength is shifted downward with rising magnitude and fragmentation. Only

in going from the light prolate Na+

27 to the light oblate Na+

35, this trend is not observed.

In heavy clusters with Ne ∼
The fragmentation (Landau damping) gets also very pronounced, since Γ and ¯ω become

b.

comparable. Due to the small value of ¯ω, however, the strength remains concentrated in a

rather narrow energy interval.

The softening of the mode as well as the enhancement of the M1 strength can be nicely

explained within the semiclassical model with the decreasing importance of the surface with

respect to the bulk as the sizes of the cluster increase. This causes a faster increase of

the mass parameter with respect to the restoring force constant coming almost entirely

from a surface shear, with consequent lowering of the energy centroid (0.1)and enhancement

of the M1 strength (0.2). A more detailed and exhaustive explanation is provided by the

microscopic excitation mechanism. By expanding the deformed single-particle wave function

into a spherical basis

Clearly, the main contribution to the transition amplitude comes from orbits with high

angular momentum l and small magnetic quantum number m. On the other hand, orbits

with high l values are present only in heavy clusters. Hence the enhancement of the M1

strength. At the same time, as the sizes of the cluster increase with consequent increment

of the number of high values of l, the density of the particle-hole (p

h) levels increases and

−

their relative spacings decrease, causing an overall downward shift and a more pronounced

fragmentation of the M1 strength. The above formula enables to sharpen the geometrical

picture of the mode. Since most of the strength comes from orbits with high l and small

m values, it follows that the oscillatory rotational motion is promoted mainly by the orbits

which are almost orthogonal to the equatorial plane.

In light clusters the M1 transition is promoted mainly by one or two conﬁgurations.

Indeed, the left and right peaks are due by more than 95% to the p-h components [200]-[211]

and [202]-[211] in Na+

15, [312]-[321] and [310]-[321] in Na+

27, and [321]-[310] and [321]-[312]

in Na+

35, having adopted the Nilsson-Clemenger notation NnzΛ [11] for the single-particle

orbitals. The reason of the small p

h admixture induced by the residual interaction is

−

simple. The p

h conﬁgurations are very few and far apart in energy. The only observable

−

eﬀect of the interaction is therefore a shift of the M1 strength. We may therefore conclude

that in light nuclei the M1 mode has the character of a single-particle excitation. Only in

heavy clusters the collective nature of the mode appears evident.

a more homogeneous comparison, we give the photoabsorption cross sections, σ(M1, µ =

P
The M1 spectrum is composed of several, roughly equally spaced, resonances, enveloping

P

closely packed transitions, coming respectively from ∆

=0, 2, 4, ... p

h excitations. The

N

−

group of ∆

=0 transitions correspond to the low-lying M1 mode predicted in the schematic

N

model [1]. The others have no classical counterpart. This large scale fragmentation limits

drastically the extent of validity of approaches which rely entirely on sum rules. It is worth

noting, on the other hand, that the cross section, being proportional to the energy weighted

M1 strength, magniﬁes the high energy transitions. Had we plotted the M1 strength, we

would have observed a most prominent peak positioned in the lowest energy region and

several others, much less pronounced, at higher energy. It is also to be pointed out that

the high energy peaks which are physically relevant, namely the ones below the ionization

threshold (which is 3.8 eV in light clusters and 3.2-3.4 eV in the heavier ones), overlap

mostly with the dipole plasmon resonance and, therefore, are hardly detectable.

The lower panel of Fig. 2 shows that, consistently with the HO relation (0.4), the E2

strength covers the same energy regions of the M1 strength. It is, however, dominant over

the M1 transition only in the intermediate region, which is in any case the domain of the

dipole plasmon resonance, and almost absent in the low-energy region. This latter interval

is exclusively covered by the M1 mode, consistently with the predictions of the schematic

model.

6

A more quantitative comparison with this model is presented for the low energy mode

in Fig. 3. Although the schematic Eqs. (1)-(2) were derived for neutral clusters only, we

considered both charged and neutral clusters. Indeed, the results change very little in moving

from one kind to the other. The energy centroids of the low-energy M1 transitions scale

with deformation and the number of valence electrons basically according to the law derived

in the schematic model [1]. The summed M1 strength scales according to the schematic law

only in heavy clusters, but ﬂuctuates strongly in the light ones. These ﬂuctuations reﬂect

the single-particle nature of the transitions and, in principle, invalidate the schematic model

for clusters of these sizes. More remarkably, the low-lying summed M1 strength exceeds

systematically the semiclassical estimates (Eq. 2) by a factor 1.5

3.5 in light clusters,

÷

and by 1.5 in large clusters. This looks quite surprising since in the schematic model the

mode gets the total M1 strength by construction. One should therefore have expected a

quenching of the strength induced by its fragmentation. This apparent paradox is solved

if we recall that the semiclassical calculation of the strength is fully equivalent to its RPA

evaluation in the ∆

= 0 HO space. Due to the degeneracy of the l conﬁgurations in the

orbits with largest angular momentum, as in our case, but is an algebraic weighted sum

of diﬀerent contributions (with small weights) from all conﬁgurations, with both large and

small l values. Hence the enhanced M1 strength produced by our calculations.

The main results of our RPA calculation are:

i) The M1 strength, at least in heavy

clusters, is not concentrated only at low energy, as predicted by the schematic model, but

spreads over a large energy region among equally spaced peaks corresponding to ∆

h transitions.

ii) In spite of that, closely packed M1 transitions still fall at

−

low energy and carry an overall strength which is even larger than the value predicted in

the schematic collective model. Such a strength can become huge in heavy clusters.

It

can reach the impressive value of 700-800 µ2

300. iii) The energy centroid

b already at Ne ∼
7

of these transitions scales with the deformation and the number of valence electrons as

in the schematic model only in heavy clusters.

In the light ones, the strong ﬂuctuations

of the summed M1 strength invalidate the schematic model.

iv)The crucial role of the

quadrupole ﬁeld in promoting the M1 mode is conﬁrmed by the close correlation established

quantitatively between M1 and E2 modes. While however the E2 strength is concentrated

mostly in the uninteresting region covered by the plasmon dipole resonance, the M1 is the

only dominant mode at low energy with a strength which becomes huge in heavy clusters.

These, somewhat surprising, properties render the mode more accessible than expected to

experiments.

Its occurrence not only would indicate the onset of deformation but would

enable to measure the deformation itself by exploiting the scaling properties of the centroids

with deformation and with the sizes of the clusters.

Abstract

We have studied the magnetic properties of free cobalt clusters in two semi-independent Stern-

Gerlach deﬂection experiments at temperatures between 60 and 307 K. We ﬁnd that clusters

consisting of 13 to 200 cobalt atoms exhibit behavior that is entirely consistent with superparam-

agnetism, though complicated by ﬁnite-system ﬂuctuations in cluster temperature. Based on their

superparamagnetic behavior, we report magnetic moments per atom for each cobalt cluster size

and compare the results of our two measurements and those performed previously.

INTRODUCTION

Interest in small magnetic systems predates the emerging ﬁeld of nanoscience by several

decades.1,2 Magnetism in small systems is eﬀectively the frontier between atomic magnetism,

surface magnetism, and bulk magnetism. Because of its strategic position, small system

magnetism has both theoretical importance in elucidating how structural and electronic

order evolve from one dimensional extreme to the other and practical importance in such

technologies as magnetic data storage and high-performance magnetic materials.

Magnetism in small and low-dimensional systems has been studied since the 1950s using

powders, granular metals, bulk surfaces, and supported ﬁlms and particles.2,3 Phenomena

observed in these contexts included superparamagnetism and surface-enhanced magnetism.

Superparamagnetism occurs when the overall moment of a small magnetically ordered par-

ticle becomes thermally decoupled from its lattice so that it can respond paramagnetically

to an applied magnetic ﬁeld.1,2,4,5 Surface-enhanced magnetism results when the decreased

coordination number and increased density of states at a surface reduces the quenching of

spin and orbital magnetism relative to what occurs in the bulk.6,7

More recently, however, the magnetic properties of atomic clusters have been studied in

the isolation of vacuum using molecular beam techniques.8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21 That

isolation has at least three interesting consequences: it frees the clusters from all chemical

interactions at their surfaces, it decouples them from external heat baths, and it emphasizes

their conserved quantities. As we will discuss, those isolation eﬀects both simplify and

complicate the observed behaviors of magnetic clusters in a beam.

One might expect that a beam of magnetic molecules of spin S would, upon passing

though a gradient magnetic ﬁeld, split into 2S + 1 beamlets. This behavior is indeed the

high-ﬁeld case for atoms and small molecules.22,23 One might also argue that the N atomic

moments µ in a ferromagnetic particle would couple together and orient themselves along the

applied magnetic ﬁeld, and that the particle as a whole would then accelerate and deﬂect
toward high ﬁeld in response to the force ∇(Nµ · B). That behavior is the high-ﬁeld,

low-temperature limit for single-domain condensed matter particles. The clusters we study

are intermediate in size and we study them at moderate temperatures and magnetic ﬁelds.

Anticipating their behaviors is therefore not so simple.

The ﬁrst magnetic deﬂection experiments on free cobalt clusters observed that these clus-

2

ters always deﬂect toward strong ﬁeld by an amount that increases as the applied magnetic

ﬁeld increases, as the relevant temperature decreases, and as the number of atoms in the

cluster increases.19 In the present measurements, we again observe deﬂections that increase

with increasing magnetic ﬁeld and decreasing temperature, and that are entirely consistent

with superparamagnetic behavior in which each cluster acts as its own heat bath at its vi-

brational temperature.24 The inﬂuence of cluster size, however, is more complicated than we

observed originally. We now ﬁnd that the each cobalt cluster’s magnetic moment depends

subtly on the number and arrangement of its atoms.

In superparamagnetism, the eﬀective magnetic moment per atom µeﬀ is reduced from the

true moment per atom µ by the Langevin function L

µeﬀ = µL(NµB/kBTvib)

(1)

= µ[coth(NµB/kBTvib) − (kBTvib/NµB)]

where N is the number of atoms in the particle, B is the applied magnetic ﬁeld, kB is

Boltzmann’s constant, and Tvib is the vibrational temperature. This reduction occurs when

thermal agitation decouples the particle’s magnetic moment from its lattice and causes

that moment to explore all possible orientations in rapid succession. Since the orientation

ﬂuctuations occur on a picosecond timescale,1,5,24 a millisecond-timescale measurement of

the particle’s magnetic momentum per atom will yield the time-averaged projection of µ
onto the applied magnetic ﬁeld axis ˆB—that is, the experiment will measure µeﬀ. This

experimental moment per atom increases linearly with applied magnetic ﬁeld for weak ﬁelds,

but eventually saturates at µ.

Equation (1) assumes that the total moment Nµ is large enough to be treated classically,

otherwise the Brillion function must replace the Langevin function. It also assumes that

all orientations of the moment relative to the particle lattice are energetically equivalent,

that the measurement time is long compared to the thermal ﬂuctuation time so that the

particle thoroughly explores the Boltzmann distribution during the measurement, and that

the particle is coupled to an inﬁnite heat bath at temperature Tvib.25

While free clusters cannot meet these assumptions perfectly, there is considerable evidence

that Eq. (1) is valid for cobalt and most other magnetic clusters over a considerable range of

experimental conditions. We note here that an adiabatic mechanism of magnetization has

recently been proposed.12 That alternative theory arose as an explanation for the broadening

3

of the cluster beam as it deﬂects. Interestingly, the adiabatic mechanism reportedly gives

the same reduction in measured magnetic moment that is predicted by superparamagnetic

theory. We will discuss these two competing explanations later in this paper. For the

present, we will interpret our experimental data using the superparamagnetic theory in

order to obtained values for µ, the magnetic moments per atom of the cobalt clusters.

What distinguishes the present study from the one performed more than a decade ago in

our laboratory19 is that we are now able to report µ for each cluster size individually. In the

earlier study, our limited sample required us to average across cluster sizes. We therefore

had to assume that µ was independent of cluster size, at least over the size range considered

(40–200 atoms). In the present work, however, we have studied each cluster size individually,

so that magnetic eﬀects due to cluster size and structure can be recognized.

The present study consists of two semi-independent experiments, which we will refer

to as E1 and E2. These experiments were conducted before (E1) and after (E2) a major

renovation of the experimental apparatus. Most signiﬁcantly, they were performed with

radically diﬀerent cluster sources and data acquisition protocols. Although E1 and E2 share

the same gradient-ﬁeld magnet and mass-spectrometer, their semi-independence makes them

a useful test of our ability to control cluster temperature and therefore make meaningful

measurements. That the results of these two studies are so similar provides considerable

support for our assertion that we understand the temperatures of clusters in our beams.

II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

In concept, the experiment is essentially the Stern-Gerlach deﬂection technique applied

to cobalt clusters. We produce a narrowly collimated beam of temperature-controlled cobalt

clusters, pass that beam through a gradient magnetic ﬁeld, and measure the deﬂections and

masses of the clusters at a distance downstream from the magnet. While we have described

this technique previously16, we discuss it again here primarily to point out the diﬀerences

between the two experiments, E1 and E2.

In both experiments, cobalt clusters were grown from atoms vaporized oﬀ a cobalt sam-

ple by the focused second-harmonic light (532 nm) of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The laser-

produced plume of cobalt vapor was captured in a pulse of dense helium gas, where cluster

growth and thermal equilibration occurred. This mixture of gas and clusters then became

4

a cluster beam through a seeded supersonic expansion into vacuum.

In experiment E1, cobalt vapor and helium mixed in a cylindrical chamber approximately

8 mm in diameter and 17.5 mm long. Clusters grew in this “waiting room” and came

gradually into thermal equilibrium with its walls before expanding into vacuum through

the chamber’s conical exit nozzle. In practice, however, clusters sprayed out of the nozzle

continuously once cobalt atoms were injected into the helium pulse. We found that only

those clusters that remained in the source as long as possible and didn’t emerge from the

chamber until it was almost empty had time to reach thermal equilibrium with the chamber

walls. The measurements we report for E1 were all conducted with clusters that had resided

in the waiting room long enough (≥1.5 ms) to reach equilibrium.

In experiment E2, cobalt vapor and helium mixed and cooled in a cylindrical channel

2.5 mm in diameter and 150 mm long. Cluster growth occurred near the start of this channel

and the resulting clusters were thermally equilibrated in the channel’s ﬁnal 100 mm, which

is temperature-controlled. The channel ends with a 1 mm cylindrical nozzle, through which

the mixture of vapors underwent a seeded supersonic expansion to form a cluster beam.

The increased surface to volume ratio of this source, coupled with the fact that the clusters

take more time to get from the point of vaporization to the nozzle, means that a greater

fraction of the clusters are in thermal equilibrium with the source upon exiting. All of the

measurements we report for E2 were made using equilibrated cobalt clusters.

Both experiments shared the same beam shaping apparatus. The cluster beam travels

through a skimmer and two narrow slits (0.4 mm wide by 2.5 mm high) that collimate

the beam, and through a chopper wheel that slices it longitudinally. The chopper wheel

performs two important functions: it allows us to select only those clusters that have come

into thermal equilibrium with the source and it permits us to measure the velocity of the

clusters. The wheel rotates at 180 Hz and is open to the cluster beam for ∼20 µs. After

passing through these collimating slits and chopper, the cluster beam is a tightly grouped

packet, narrow in all three spatial dimensions.

Clusters in this packet then pass through the gradient ﬁeld magnet, where they accelerate
in response to the force ∇(Nµ · B). Since the magnet’s ﬁeld gradient is perpendicular to

the cluster beam axis, magnetic clusters are deﬂected, and it is that deﬂection that we

subsequently measure.

The gradient ﬁeld magnet is 250 mm long and its gradient is nearly constant in the region

5

traversed by the cluster beam.26 We can vary the ﬁeld gradient experienced by the clusters

from 0 T/m to 360 T/m, while simultaneously varying the ﬁeld at the position of the cluster

packet from 0 T to 0.951 T.

After leaving the magnet, clusters pass through a ∼1 m ﬁeld-free drift region and are then

ionized by a spatially ﬁltered pulse of laser light (193 nm, ArF Excimer) in a time-of-ﬂight

mass spectrometer. This narrow light beam propagates antiparallel to the cluster beam and

ionizes only those clusters that have deﬂected a speciﬁc distance from the undeﬂected beam

center. By recording the resulting mass spectra at a range of positions relative to the beam

center, we obtain a complete deﬂection proﬁle for each of the cluster sizes present in the

beam.

In experiment E1, these deﬂection proﬁles were obtained one magnetic ﬁeld at a time.

With the source producing pulses of clusters at 20 Hz and the magnetic ﬁeld and ﬁeld

gradient set to one value, we scanned the laser beam back and forth across the cluster beam

and accumulated cluster deﬂection proﬁles for several hours. We then chose another ﬁeld

and ﬁeld gradient and repeated this exercise. We periodically turned oﬀ the magnet to

obtain a zero-ﬁeld proﬁle to establish the undeﬂected beam center.

Because the experimental apparatus is ∼3 m long and the temperature in the laboratory

varies over the course of a day, there are small but unavoidable movements in the equipment.

Furthermore, the intensity and direction of the cluster beam itself drifts with time as the

sample ages and soot accumulates on the source’s internal surfaces. These changes produce

gradual shifts in the measured deﬂection proﬁles, and the one-ﬁeld-at-a-time measurement

approach used in experiment E1 makes it diﬃcult to remove these shifts from the data.

Conversely, in experiment E2, through computer automation, we collected data randomly

in both position and magnetic ﬁeld, with the magnetic ﬁeld switching between various values

(including zero) and the ionizing laser shifting to a new randomly selected position a few

times a minute. Although the source used in E2 produced pulses of clusters at 30 Hz, a

single experimental run still spanned an entire day. Although the long duration of each

experimental run in E2 may have increased the statistical uncertainty, experimental drift no

longer contributed signiﬁcantly to the systematic uncertainty.

III. RESULTS

A. Residence Time Studies

Because clusters spend >100 µs passing through the gradient ﬁeld magnet, our experi-

mental measurement timescale is long compared to the ∼1 ps timescale of superparamagnetic

ﬂuctuations. Assuming that the cobalt clusters behave superparamagnetically in these ex-

periments, the magnetic moment responsible for a cluster’s deﬂection by the gradient ﬁeld

magnet is the time-averaged projection of that cluster’s true moment onto the magnetic

ﬁeld. The experimentally measured moment per atom µexpt is thus the eﬀective moment per

atom µeﬀ given by Eq. (1).

One of the best indications that cobalt clusters behave superparamagnetically in our

experiments is that µexpt has the correct functional dependence on applied magnetic ﬁeld B

and cluster vibrational temperature Tvib. In order to be sure that we know Tvib, however,

we must prove that the clusters have resided in the source long enough to reach thermal

equilibrium with its walls. We can then use the source’s wall temperature as Tvib in all the

subsequent analysis.

Because knowing Tvib is so important, we regularly perform studies in which we measure

µexpt as a function of residence time in the source. As shown in Fig. 1, we always observe

an initial rise in µexpt with increasing residence time, followed by a long period of saturation

in which additional residence time has no eﬀect on the measured moment per atom. Our

ﬁnal moment measurements were all conducted on clusters with residence times suﬃcient

to ensure that they had reached thermal equilibrium with their sources and had vibrational

temperatures Tvib equal to their source temperatures.

B. Measured Magnetic Moments

In both experiments, E1 and E2, we obtained deﬂection proﬁles for each cluster size at

many temperatures Tvib and many magnetic ﬁelds B. We calculated a µexpt from each proﬁle

and then ﬁt all the measurements for a given cluster size to Eq. (1). The high quality of the

ﬁts demonstrates the validity of the superparamagnetic assumption—the clusters are indeed

superparamagnetic—and the only free parameter in each ﬁt is µ, the true magnetic moment

per atom for that cluster size.

Figure 2 shows the values of µ obtained for each cluster size in the two experiments,

E1 and E2, and those values are also listed in Table I. The listed values include only the

statistical uncertainties, which are small and demonstrate the excellent agreement between

the superparamagnetic model and the experimental observations. The systematic uncer-

tainties are larger and reﬂect limitations in the magnet calibration, position control of the

cluster beam in the magnet, and the control of vibrational temperature. We estimate this

systematic uncertainty at ±7% in E1 and ±5% in E2.

IV. DISCUSSION

In addition to the two experiments reported here, there have been two other experimental

studies of magnetism in free cobalt clusters published recently: a study by Xu et al.12

(hereafter referred to as Xu) covering the entire range of cluster sizes discussed in the present

work and a study by Knickelbein18 focusing on clusters consisting of between 7 and 32

atoms. There are many important similarities and diﬀerences between the results of the

four experiments.

One of their most notable and physically important similarities is that they all ﬁnd en-

hanced magnetism, relative to that of bulk cobalt (1.7 µB/atom), in all of the cobalt clusters

that deﬂected toward strong ﬁeld. This enhancement has been observed before8,9,10,11,19 and

anticipated theoretically due to the reduced dimensionality of the clusters.6,7 Their small size

leads to an increase in the density of states at the Fermi level and to increased contributions

from unquenched orbital and spin magnetism.27,28

Perhaps the most striking diﬀerence between the studies appears in the smallest sizes

observed. Figure 3 shows values of µ for clusters consisting of between 13 and 32 atoms

for all four experiments. While our experiments E1 and E2 found similar µ values, they

diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those obtained by Knickelbein and those of Xu. Not only do few

of the µ values agree between these three groups, there is also little correlation between

relative maxima and minima as a function of cluster size. And while our experiments found

µ decreasing with increasing size up to Co26, Knickelbein found µ approximately constant

up to that size and Xu found µ increasing with increasing size over that range.

While these diﬀerence could simply reﬂect problems with one or more of the experi-

ments, they could also stem from more exciting thermal and isomeric issues. Both Xu

and Knickelbein studied clusters smaller and colder than we studied, and thereby observed

some interesting behaviors. Knickelbein measured a marked change in the deﬂection pro-

ﬁles of the smallest clusters at low temperatures. These clusters apparently shift from a

superparamagnetic state at higher temperature to a non-superparamagnetic state at lower

temperature.

Both Xu and Knickelbein have also reported the presence of two distinct populations

of magnetic isomers in their beams under certain conditions.18,29 Although geometric iso-

mers of cobalt clusters have been predicted and studied theoretically,30,31,32,33 the calculated

diﬀerences in their magnetic moments were not as large as those observed in these two ex-

periments. Since we found no evidence of a second, less-magnetic population in either of

our experiments, the isomer populations in our cluster beams may have been diﬀerent from

those in the beams of Knickelbein and Xu. Such isomer diﬀerences could explain why the

values for µ that we measured in the small clusters are larger than those measured by either

Knickelbein or Xu.

For superparamagnetic cobalt clusters with up to 26 atoms, theoretical studies30,31,33 have

predicted that µ should decrease with increasing cluster size, consistent with the trend we

10

observe in E1 and E2. One of those theoretical studies30 also predicts a sharp minimum in µ

for Co26, a feature that appears in both of our experimental results. However, the average µ

values predicted by these calculations are lower than our average µ value and closer to those

of Xu and Knickelbein. Nonetheless, the models used in those calculations don’t consider

unquenched orbital magnetism, and recent work has shown that electron orbital motion can

contribute substantially to the overall magnetic moments of small clusters.28

For clusters consisting of between 26 and 32 atoms, the µ values reported by Xu are similar

to our µ values, while those obtained by Knickelbein are still signiﬁcantly lower. Knickelbein

didn’t study clusters consisting of more than 32 atoms. All three of the experiments that

continue beyond Co32 observe a local maximum in µ at Co36–Co37, followed by a rapid

decrease in µ as the next 4 or 5 atoms are added. That sudden decline in µ suggests that

a basic structural change is occurring in the cobalt clusters over this size range. Yang

et al.34 and Parks et al.35 also found evidence for a structural change in this size range in

their ionization potential and chemical reactivity studies, respectively. While the theoretical

studies do not predict a decline in µ, they do not consider every cluster size for these larger

clusters.30,31

Above about Co42, all three experiments observed small oscillations in µ with increasing

cluster size. This behavior is typical of clusters of ferromagnetic materials and has been

explained in terms of the shell model of cluster growth.10,36,37,38 In the shell model, the spec-

trum of cluster sizes is punctuated occasionally by unusually stable “closed shell” clusters,

where what has closed is either a geometrical layer of atoms or a set of electronic levels.

Long associated with “magic numbers” in cluster population distributions, closed-shell clus-

ters are also expected to have extremal values of µ in ferromagnetic clusters. Beyond each

shell closing, the value of µ is expected to drift ﬁrst away from its extreme value and then

back toward that extreme value as the next larger shell closes.

The diﬀerences in the oscillations observed in the three experiments (E1, E2, and Xu)

illustrate how diﬃcult it is to make ideal measurements. Not only are there statistical and

systematic uncertainties in the measurements, there are also inhomogeneities and irrepro-

ducibilities in the cluster samples themselves. In each experiment, the cluster samples must

inevitably include minor isomers: clusters with equal numbers of atoms but slight diﬀerences

in how some of those atoms are arranged on the cluster surfaces. There is now evidence

that more signiﬁcant isomers are also present,18,29 isomers with very diﬀerent magnetic mo-

11

ments and properties and with relative populations that may depend on temperature and/or

carrier gas pressure.

One noticeable diﬀerence between our experiments and that of Xu is that our µ values

are consistently about 0.2 µB per atom larger than Xu’s. This diﬀerence could be due

to systematic errors in the measurements themselves. First, Xu’s clusters could be hotter

than expected, or ours colder. Because each experiment includes data collected at several

diﬀerent temperatures, however, one or both experiments would have to be mistaken about

temperature by the same percentage at each temperature studied.

Second, a systematic error in either lab in the calibration or alignment of the gradient-

ﬁeld magnet, or in the measurement of the beam position in that magnet, could explain

the discrepancy. To reduce the possibility of such a systemic error in our lab, we carefully

reexamined the beam position and alignment between experiments E1 and E2, using a

completely diﬀerent approach from the one used before E1. It is thus unlikely that errors in

our magnet position or alignment are responsible for the discrepancy, although inaccuracy

in our magnet calibration remains a possibility.

There is also an interesting trend to the small diﬀerences between the µ values measured

in our two experiments, E1 and E2. For Co30 to Co65, the measured values of µ were typically

a little lower in E1 than in E2, while for Co65 up, the measured values were typically a little

higher in E1 than in E2. This switch could be the result of a gas expansion eﬀect in E1. In

experiment E1’s “waiting room” source, gas leaving the source at long residence times may

have cooled itself by doing work on gas leaving the source at short residence times. This

same cooling eﬀect occurs when you open a can of compressed air. Since larger clusters

take longer to form and cool, we usually study them at longer residence times than the

smaller clusters. In E1, those larger clusters may have equilibrated with gas that had cooled

itself slightly below the actual temperature of the source and those larger clusters may be

slightly colder than we expect. Overestimating their temperatures when ﬁtting data from

these clusters to Eq. (1) would lead us to overestimate their magnetic moments per atom.

We looked for such a cooling eﬀect in the residence time studies themselves, but could

not prove its presence or absence convincingly. While the residence time study in Fig. 1(a)

may include a slight peak in µ near 1400 µs, consistent with a gas temperature that has

dropped slightly below the source temperature, the experimental uncertainty is too large for

any deﬁnitive observations. Still, it would not take much excess cooling in E1 to explain the

12

small diﬀerences in µ between E1 and E2 for Co65 up. It is worth noting that almost all of

the µ values obtained in E1 and E2 for Co65 up fall within the 2.24±0.14 µB/atom range

reported a decade ago in Ref. 19 for Co65 through Co215.

While we have interpreted the data from experiments E1 and E2 using the superparam-

agnetic model, the applicability of that model to small, isolated clusters remains a matter

of some controversy. In its simplest form, the superparamagnetic model predicts that clus-

ters of a given size should deﬂect homogeneously to strong ﬁeld so that there should be

no broadening of the deﬂected beam proﬁle. After observing substantial broadening in the

deﬂected proﬁles, Xu et al. proposed an alternative model for the magnetic response of the

clusters.

In their adiabatic magnetization model, clusters entering a magnetic ﬁeld shift

adiabatically into magnetic states through avoided crossings between Zeeman levels.12,39,40

According to this model, clusters deﬂect towards strong ﬁeld on average, but since each clus-

ter has its own unique experimental magnetic moment, the deﬂected beam proﬁle broadens

signiﬁcantly. Despite that broadening, Xu et al.

report that the average magnetization

follows the Langevin function and Eq. (1),12 so that the adiabatic model produces average

deﬂections that are indistinguishable from those produced by the superparamagnetic model.

However, the presence of broadening in the deﬂected beam proﬁle does not rule out the

superparamagnetic model. There are at least two reasons why even truly superparamag-

netic clusters will exhibit broadened proﬁles in beam deﬂection experiments. First, Eq. (1)

shows that µeﬀ, the time-average projection of the cluster’s true magnetic moment onto the

magnetic ﬁeld, is approximately proportional to the magnitude of that magnetic ﬁeld. Since

the cluster beam has a ﬁnite width and the magnet through which it passes has a gradient

magnetic ﬁeld, clusters on the low ﬁeld side of the beam will have smaller µeﬀ and deﬂect

less than clusters on the high ﬁeld side. The magnetic ﬁeld gradient also varies along the

height of the cluster beam, perpendicular to the plane of the experiment, further broadening

the experimental deﬂection proﬁles.

The second and more important source of proﬁle broadening in deﬂected superparamag-

netic clusters is the statistical nature of small systems. The µeﬀ given by Eq.

(1) depends

on temperature, but what is the temperature of a particle of only a few dozen atoms? This

question is especially appropriate in light of the fact that isolated clusters have several dif-

ferent temperatures (translational, vibrational, and rotational) that are often not in thermal

equilibrium with one another.16

13

Thermodynamics is based on the fact that at a temperature, T , a system’s extensive

properties will ﬂuctuate with a variance on the order of 1/N, where N is the number of

particles in the system. It was designed to describe phenomena in macroscopic systems, in

which N is very large and the energies associated with those phenomena are much greater

than kBT .

In nearly inﬁnite systems, ﬂuctuations produce insigniﬁcant and essentially

undetectable ﬂuctuations in the extensive properties.

But ﬂuctuations are not insigniﬁcant in ﬁnite systems such as clusters. Recent work has

shown that if the energies associated with phenomena in ﬁnite systems are of the order

kBT , then the ﬂuctuations in the value of an extensive property can be on the order of that

property’s average value.41,42,43

In our experiment, the clusters’ magnetic energies NµB are rarely larger than kBT

and ﬂuctuations in observed magnetism should therefore be substantial. More speciﬁcally,

spreads in the experimental magnetic moments could be on the order of those experimen-

tal moments themselves. Such statistical distributions in experimental magnetic moments,

together with the likely presence of minor isomers, should cause the width of a beam of

superparamagnetic clusters to increase signiﬁcantly as it deﬂects.

We ﬁnd that the increase in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a cluster

deﬂection proﬁle is proportional to the average deﬂection of that proﬁle divided by the

number of atoms in the cluster (Fig. 4). The smaller the cluster and the farther it deﬂects

on average, the broader its deﬂection proﬁle.

We saw no evidence of deﬂection to weak ﬁeld in any of our measurements. In fact, we

observed the deﬂection of the cluster beam’s low-ﬁeld edge by strong magnetic ﬁelds and

ﬁeld gradients and found that we could deﬂect that edge of the beam toward strong-ﬁeld by

as much as 1 mm. This deﬂection was complete in that there were no clusters left undeﬂected

at beam’s low-ﬁeld edge. If any of the clusters had deﬂected toward weak-ﬁeld or avoided

deﬂection altogether, there would not have been an empty region along the low-ﬁeld side of

the beam. We found no clusters there, indicating that all of the clusters deﬂected toward

strong-ﬁeld, in accordance with superparamagnetism.

FIG. 4: As cobalt clusters consisting of N atoms deﬂect toward strong ﬁeld in our apparatus, their

deﬂection proﬁle broadens and its full width at half maximum (FWHM) increases. The diﬀerence

in proﬁle widths between magnetic ﬁeld on and magnetic ﬁeld oﬀ (FWHMﬁeld on − FWHMﬁeld oﬀ )

is approximately proportional to the average deﬂection with the magnetic ﬁeld on divided by N .

The line is a ﬁt to the experimental points.

V. CONCLUSION

We have measured the magnetic moments per atom for small cobalt clusters (13–200

atoms) and ﬁnd them size dependent. All of these clusters have magnetic moments per

atom that are larger than the value for bulk cobalt (1.7 µB/atom), evidence that the re-

duced dimensionality and increased surface to volume ratio of clusters leads to enhanced

magnetism. We have observed a large drop in magnetic moment per atom beyond Co38,

a feature which suggests a structural change at this size. We also see gradual magnetic

oscillations with increasing size, consistent with a shell model of cluster growth. Changes

made to our experimental apparatus and data acquisition procedure were found to have had

little impact on the results. We ﬁnd that superparamagnetism and the statistics of ﬁnite

systems can explain both our experimentally observed magnetic moments per atom and the

spreads in the deﬂection proﬁles of all of the clusters.

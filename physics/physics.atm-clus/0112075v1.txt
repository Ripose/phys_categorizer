The structural and magnetic properties of Co18−mCum
(0 ≤ m ≤ 18) clusters are investigated with a genetic al-
gorithm and a spd-band model Hamiltonian in the unre-
stricted Hartree-Hock approximation respectively. In general,
Cu atoms tend to occupy the surface, while Co atoms prefer
to the interior of the clusters. Layered structures appear in
some clusters with given stoichiometric compositions. The in-
troduction of Cu atoms leads to large increase of the magnetic
moment of Co-rich circumstance and nearly zero magnetism
of the Cu-rich ambient. The interaction between Cu and Co
atoms induces nonzero magnetic moment for Cu atoms. The
total magnetic moments tend to decrease with the increase of
Cu atoms. However, some particular large magnetic moment
are found to be closely related to the structures. The envi-
ronment of Cu and Co atoms have a dominant eﬀect on the
magnetism of the cluster.

Bimetallic clusters are an exciting research ﬁeld due
to their potential applications in the automobile indus-
try and oil reﬁned as catalysts1,2. Such nanoscale alloys
may present a number of structures and phases that are
diﬀerent from those of corresponding pure metals. Previ-
ously, there are intensive studies on homogeneous metal-
lic clusters. But the reports on the bimetallic clusters are
scarce3–9, especially for transition-metal bimetallic clus-
ters because of the complexity in their electronic struc-
ture.

In this report, we exploit the structural and magnetic
properties of bimetallic Co-Cu clusters. The main reason
for choosing Co-Cu is that the physical properties of bulk
Co and Cu are very diﬀerent. We may get a clear picture
of the various properties of the bimetallic clusters versus
the diﬀerent composition ratios. Moreover, Co and Cu
alloys are non-miscible. The clusters may give a qualita-
tive analysis from the mecoscopical points.

Although the reliable results on clusters can be ob-
tained on basis of quantum chemistry or density function
theory6–9, the well-known NP problem leads to expen-
sive computational costs. Alternatively, empirical po-
tential ﬁtted from the bulk materials have been exten-
sively employed to study the structures and properties
of clusters4,5,10–14. In this letter, we obtain the lowest
energy structures of Co18−mCum (0 ≤ m ≤ 18) by a
genetic algorithm (GA) with a Gupta-like many-body
potential11. The parameters for inhomogeneous Cu-Co
interaction are derived from the average of the Cu-Cu
and Co-Co parameters. In the GA scheme15–18, a num-

ber of random initial conﬁgurations are generated in the
beginning. Then any two candidates in the population
can be chosen as parents to generate a child cluster by
mating operation. The obtained child cluster can be se-
lected to replace its parent, if it has lower binding energy
but its conﬁguration is diﬀerent from any one in the pop-
ulation.

We have checked the validity of current parameteriza-
tion by ab initio calculation on the smallest clusters, i.e.,
homogeneous and inhomogeneous dimers and trimers.
The ab initio calculation is performed by using DMol
package based on density functional theory (DFT)19.
During the DMol electronic structure calculations, the ef-
fective core potential (ECP) and a double numerical basis
including d-polarization function (DND) are chosen. The
density function is treated within the generalized gra-
dient approximation (GGA)20 with exchange-correlation
potential parameterized by Wang and Perdew21. A direct
comparison of the ab initio and empirical results on the
structural information such as equilibrium bond length
and bond angle for those small clusters is given in Table.
I. One can ﬁnd that all the bond angles of either ho-
mogeneous or inhomogeneous trimers are well described
by empirical potential. Except Co2 dimer, the diﬀerence
of bond length between DFT and empirical calculation
is less than 0.05˚A. We have further veriﬁed our empir-
ical scheme by calculating the clusters Co13 and Cu13.
The average bond length and average binding energy per
atom of Co are 2.45˚A and 3.22 eV, which are 2.44 ˚A22
and 3.66±0.36 eV9 from ﬁrst-principles calculations. For
Cu13, the bond length and the binding energy are 2.50˚A
and 2.59 eV , in agreement with the results of TB-LMTO,
2.52˚A and 2.46 eV23. From the above comparisons, the
overall agreement of our present model potential with ac-
curate ab initio is rather reasonable. Therefore, we can
use such Gupta-like potential in the global structural op-
timization of 18-atom Cu-Co bimetallic clusters, in which
ab initio calculations up to long time scale is computa-
tional prohibitive.

sis) for small Co, Cu or Co-Cu clusters.

Fig.1 gives the morphology structures corresponding
to diﬀerent stoichiometric composition of Co18−m(0 ≤
m ≤ 18). Great modiﬁcations are found in the bimetal-
lic clusters. The most stable structures for the clusters
with m = 0, 2, 15 − 18 are double icosahedron minus an
atom in the layer, while the rest ones prefer to the bell-
like structures. These imply that the mixing process has
a great inﬂuence on the ground state structures. This
may be original from the fact that 18-atom constitutes
a double icosahedron with a defect. The existence of a
defect may easily induce a structural transition. Hence,
we can alter the composition ratios to attain some new
structures.

FIG. 1. Optimized structures of Co18−mCum with various

concentrations.

Segregation eﬀect is found in the ground state struc-
tures of bimetallic clusters: Cu atoms tend to occupy
the surface, while Co atoms prefer to the interior. The
early occupied sites by Cu atoms have lower coordina-
tion number (CN), then the higher CN. Take Co5Cu13
as an example, eleven Cu atoms occupy the sites with
CNs being 5 or 6, the rest 3 Cu atoms are in the layer
with CNs=8. Moreover, the same kinds of atoms tend
to assemble together in the same layer. The assembling
Cu atoms tend to maximize the number of Cu-Cu and
Co-Co bonds. This phenomenon may be due to the great
diﬀerence of the surface energy and the cohesive energy
between Co and Cu. To minimize the total energy, the
atom with the smaller surface energy and cohesive en-
ergy tends to occupy the surface, while the atom with a
higher surface energy and cohesive energy favors to the
interior. The average cohesive energy and surface energy

2

of the bulk Cu, 3.544 eV and 1.934 Jm−2, are smaller
than those of the bulk Co, 4.386 eV and 2.709 Jm−2.
Another possible reason is the atomic size eﬀect. In our
simulations, the ﬁrst-nearest distance of Cu is 2.556˚A ,
larger than that of Co 2.507˚A. Thus, Co are more easily
surrounded by Cu atoms.

Another interesting ﬁnding is the appearance of lay-
ered structures in the bimetallic clusters. For Co13Cu5,
ﬁve Cu atoms occupy the lower CN sites while thirteen
Co atoms constitute an icosahedron. Similar features are
found in the clusters Co8Cu10 and Co7Cu11,etc. These
imply the existence of some ordering eﬀects to maximize
the number of Co-Cu bond. The ordering eﬀect and the
segregation eﬀect coexist and compete with each other
in the cluster, thus lead to the appearance of layered
structure and the segregation of Cu atoms. The bizarre
structure characters may bring some peculiar properties.
Our previous studies have shown some peculiar thermal
behavior in Cu-Co bimetallic clusters24. In the following,
we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties by
parameterized unrestricted Hartee-Fock approximation.

Udd(Co) is obtained from Ref.27 , and Uss/Udd relations
are from the atomic tables. We take Udss = Upp = Usp
and Usd = Upd = Uss+Udd

come from Ref.28.

Fig.2 gives the total magnetic moment of Co18−mCum
bimetallic clusters as a function of the concentration of
Cu atoms. The total magnetic moments decrease from
33.61µb to 0µb as the Cu concentrations vary from m = 2
to m = 13. The curve can be divided to three sec-
tions. The ﬁrst section is the Co-rich circumstance with
m = 1 − 5, where the introduction of a small amount of
Cu atoms enhances the magnetism of the clusters. The
contribution to the magnetism mainly comes from the
Co atoms far away from Cu atoms.
It may be due to
the large charge transfer between Cu and Co atoms. The
second section is the comparative composition ratio with
m = 6 − 12, in which the magnetic moments ﬂuctuate
with the cluster size. For the clusters with concentra-
tions m = 6 − 8, the case is very similar to the ﬁrst.
But in the case of m = 9 − 11, the interior pentagonal
bipyramid signiﬁcantly contributes to the magnetism of
the cluster. Thus, relatively large magnetic moments are
found for these clusters. The third section is the Cu-
rich clusters with m = 13 − 17. Cu atoms seem to have
a ”screen” eﬀect on the magnetic moments and lead to
zero magnetic moment in these clusters.

Concentration of Cu atom

FIG. 2. The total magnetic moments of Co18−mCum
bimetallic clusters as a function of the concentrations of Cu
atoms.

The magnetism of the cluster is found closely related
to the environments of Co and Cu atoms and the cluster
geometrical characters. For example, the total magnetic
moment of Co16Cu2 is much larger than those of Co17Cu1
and Co15Cu3. The main reason is due to the large charge

transfer between Co-Cu. Obviously, the number of Co-
Cu bond in Co16Cu2 is much more than that of Co17Cu1
and Co15Cu3. The more the number of Co-Cu bond in
the cluster, the larger the charge transfer, which induces
a large magnetic moment. Similarly, the large magnetic
moments for Co11Cu7 and Co8Cu10 are obtained, com-
pared with Co10Cu8 and Co7Cu11. Contrary, the to-
tal magnetic moments for Co13Cu5 is found much larger
than that for Co12Cu6, even the number of Co-Cu bond
in the former is more than the latter one. As discussed
above, Co13Cu5 is a good layered structure with 5 Cu
atoms in the same layer and 13 Co atoms constituting
an icosahedron. Although the high symmetry compresses
the magnetism of the clusters, the 5 Cu atoms has an
less eﬀect to the icosahedron. It is well-known that the
smaller the cluster size, the larger the magnetic moments.
Therefore, a large magnetic moment is obtained for the
cluster Co13Cu5.

Concentration of Cu atom

FIG. 3. Average magnetic moments of Co and Cu atoms

as a function of the concentrations of Cu atoms.

It is also worthy to note the nonzero magnetic moment
of Cu atoms in some bimetallic clusters. Fig.3 shows
the average moments of Co and Cu as a function of the
concentration of Cu. Although the average magnetic mo-
ment of Cu atoms is zero or nearly zero in most cases, par-
ticularly high magnetic moments are found in the clusters
with m = 1 − 3 and less pronounced peaks are found at
m = 6, 12. For the case of Co atoms, the hybridization
with the Cu atoms leads to an oscillatory behavior for
the average magnetic moment. These may be due to the
diﬀerent charge transfer. For Co atoms, the charges are
transferred from sp orbitals to d orbital, contrary to the
case of Cu atoms that the charges are transferred from d
orbital to sp orbitals. Further, the charge transfer takes
place from Co atoms to Cu atoms for the clusters with
Cu concentration m < 13, while the case is reverse for
m ≥ 13. For the case of m = 3, 6, 12, the charge transfer
from Co atoms to Cu atoms is found very large, which
induces the large magnetism of Cu atom.

To explore the origin of peculiar magnetic properties,
we show the total density of states(DOS) and sp,d DOS of
the pure and represented bimetallic clusters in Fig.4. The

cluster Fermi level is presented as a dashed vertical line
and shifted to zero. In general, the DOS near to Fermi
level play a primary role in determining the magnetism of
the clusters. Obviously, the contribution of d electrons is
found dominantly, while the sp electrons contribution is
low. The contribution of d electrons in Co16Cu2 is larger
than that in Co18, which leads to a large increase of the
magnetic moments in Co16Cu2. Similarly, the contribu-
tion of d electrons in Co16Cu2 is also larger than that
in Co13Cu5, thus their corresponding magnetism are dif-
ferent from each other. For Co10Cu8, the contribution
of d electrons is relatively less near to the Fermi level
compared with other cases, which leads to a particular
small magnetic moments. Moreover, the hybridization
between sp and d orbitals among Co-Cu, Co-Co and Cu-
Cu atoms in Co10Cu8 is also smallest among these four
cases, while it is largest in Co16Cu2. This also enhances
the magnetism of Co16Cu2.

In summary, the geometrical and magnetic properties
of bimetallic clusters Co18−mCum have been studied by
a genetic algorithm and a spin polarized tight-binding
Hamiltonian. The main conclusions can be made as fol-
lows: (1) Great modiﬁcations are found for the 18-atom
bimetallic clusters due to diﬀerent composition ratios.
This suggests that we can alter the composition ratios
to attain new structures.
(2) Ordering eﬀect and seg-
regation eﬀect inﬂuence the atomic conﬁgurations of the
bimetallic clusters simultaneously, which leads to the seg-
regation of the Cu atoms to the surface and some layered
structures. These may explain why there are no corre-
sponding ordered compounds of Co-Cu bulk in the low
temperature. (3) The introduction of Cu atoms causes a
dramatic increase of magnetism in Co-rich circumstance
and nonzero moments for Cu atoms. Particular large
moments can be associated with the environments of Co
and Cu atoms and the geometrical characters. (4) Cu
atoms have an ”screen” eﬀect on the cluster magnetism
in Cu-rich ambient and enhance the magnetics in Co-rich

environment.

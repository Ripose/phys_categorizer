Abstract

We carry out a microscopic analysis of the ground and excited states of the Na8

metal cluster within the jellium model. We perform a series of conﬁguration inter-

action calculations on a Hartree-Fock basis and construct eigenstates of the Hamil-

tonian which carry up to 4-particle 4-hole components. Based on the analysis of the

dipole transition strengths, we single out those states which can be interpreted as

the collective dipole plasmon and its double excitations. These modes are found to

possess a high degree of harmonicity, deviations from the harmonic limit remaining,

however, of the order of 10%.

Collective vibrational states are known both in metal clusters [1,2] and in nu-

clei [3]. They are interpreted as the excitations of vibrational quanta, the so

called plasmons or phonons. In particular, the dipole plasmon excitation in

clusters, corresponding to an oscillation of the centre of mass of the valence

electrons against that of the positive ions, is a very collective mode and dom-

inates the response to a laser ﬁeld. Microscopically, its frequency and strong

collectivity are quite well reproduced by the random phase approximation

(RPA) within the jellium model. This model [4,5] considers a uniform positive

charge distribution generated by the ions (the jellium) which interacts with a

cloud of delocalized valence electrons (also interacting among themselves) via

the Coulomb interaction. RPA predicts that the plasmon oscillation is per-

fectly harmonic [6], i.e. that states corresponding to a n-fold excitation of the

plasmon exist and their energy is equal to n times that of the single plasmon.

If the jellium-electron interaction can be approximated by a harmonic oscil-

lator potential, as it is reasonably true for a highly positively ionized cluster,

this is what one expects on general grounds [7]. Indeed, in that case the total

electron eigenfunctions are simply products of the type

Ψ(r1, r2, ...rN ) = ψnl(R)φνλ(r′

1, r′

2, ...r′

N ) ,

(1)

where R is the coordinate of the centre of mass of the electrons with the har-

monic oscillator quantum numbers (nl) describing its motion, while r′

i are the

intrinsic coordinates of the electrons with ν and λ classifying the harmonic

oscillator states of their relative motion. A dipole external ﬁeld acting on the

ground state of the system, ψ00φ00, causes the transition to ψ01φ00, acting

on the latter excites the states ψ10φ00 and ψ02φ00, and so on, generating a

perfectly harmonic band. Of course, other bands exist, based on diﬀerent in-

trinsic motion states φνλ, with no electromagnetic transitions among them.

This was checked numerically in Ref. [8] for the very simple case of two inter-

acting electrons moving in a harmonic oscillator potential. When this potential

is replaced by the Coulomb potential generated by the jellium charge distri-

bution the above level scheme is modiﬁed and it was found in Ref. [8] that

2

diﬀerent bands still exist, deviating from the harmonic limit and with non

zero multipole transition probabilities among them. These results show that

the anharmonicities in the dipole plasmon excitation are due to the coupling

between the intrinsic and centre of mass motions of the electrons.

This has been recently discussed quite in general in Ref. [9]. In this work, the

authors make explicit in a very clear way the coupling between intrinsic and

centre of mass motions by considering an expansion of the ionic background

potential Vion(ri) = Vion(r′

i+R) in power series with respect to R. Appreciable

deviations from the harmonic scheme are found within this approach [9]. For

example, for a Na+

93 cluster it is found that the most important optical dipole

transitions are separated by a ∆En equal to 2.8 eV , 3.07 eV and 3.26 eV for

the single (n = 1), double (n = 2) and triple (n = 3) plasmon excitations,

respectively. These results should be compared with the contradictory ones

found in Refs. [10] and [11], namely essentially zero and huge anharmonicities,

respectively. This is due to the fact that the coupling between intrinsic and

centre of mass motions is almost completely neglected in Ref. [10]. On the other

hand, the boson expansion used in Ref. [11] was truncated at the same order

as previously done for the study of the double excitation of Giant Resonances

in atomic nuclei [12]. In the latter case, anharmonicities of the order of a few

hundred keV as compared with the harmonic limit energy of 20÷30MeV were

found. The huge anharmonicities found in metallic clusters are probably an

indication that the convergence of the boson expansion is much slower in that

case and this can be related to the long range of the Coulomb interaction [7].

To our knowledge, there is no experimental clear evidence on the existence of

states corresponding to the double excitation of the dipole plasmon [13,14].

On the other hand, in atomic nuclei, the existence of multiphonon states has

3

been known for many years [3] and the anharmonicities in their excitation

spectra have been found to play a role in several physical processes [15].

This and the very interesting results found in Ref. [9] encouraged us to attempt

a conﬁguration interaction (CI) calculation for small metal clusters. Indeed,

this is a priori the best method to obtain the energy spectrum. On the other

hand, since the states we want to study are quite high in energy, namely at

about twice or more that of the plasmon, the conﬁguration space required

to get reliable solutions becomes very rapidly prohibitively large when the

size of the cluster increases. We have thus limited our analysis to Na8. Similar

calculations for several light Na clusters have been reported in Ref. [16] where,

however, only the ground state and the singly excited dipole state were studied.

Let us then shortly describe our calculations and discuss the results. Within

the jellium model the motion of the valence electrons is determined by the

hamiltonian

where rc is the radius of the jellium sphere, i.e. rc = rsN 1/3

Seitz radius which is 4 a.u. for Na and Ne is the number of electrons. We are

aware of the fact that, for a small metal cluster, the jellium approximation may

4

be not completely adequate for a quantitative comparison with experimental

data. However, it already contains many important physical features while

allowing not too heavy calculations as compared with more elaborated models.

As a ﬁrst step we make a Hartree-Fock (HF) calculation in order to ﬁx single

particle (sp) energies and wavefunctions. This is done by allowing the wave-

functions to be superpositions of harmonic oscillator wavefunctions (h.o.w.f.’s).

The number of h.o.w.f.’s has to be chosen large enough to get a HF ground

state energy satisfactorily stable for small variations of the h.o. parameter

around the value giving the minimum. Next, we construct all Slater determi-

nants with ﬁxed values of the projection ML of the total angular momentum,

of the projection MS of the total spin and of the parity π. This set is truncated

by i) truncating the sp basis; ii) putting a maximum value n for the number of

particle-hole excitations (np-nh) with respect to the HF ground state and/or

for the unperturbed excitation energy. We have considered several truncations

corresponding to i) up to 10 HF orbitals above the Fermi level; ii) all Slater

determinants having up to 3p-3h conﬁgurations and containing those 4p-4h

conﬁgurations whose unperturbed energy with respect to the HF ground state

is less than a given cutoﬀ energy Ec. The use of the HF basis should optimize

the convergence of the results because part of the correlations are already

taken into account in the reference state.

The largest basis we have been able to manage has dimension ∼ 700000; it

is to be noted, however, that many matrix elements of the hamiltonian in

such a basis are zero: the hamiltonian matrix is sparse. We have then used a

NAG library routine especially intended for such a case. The routine ﬁnds the

N eigenvalues of largest absolute value and the corresponding eigenvectors.

This method is very suitable for our case since we are interested in the lowest

5

negative eigenvalues which are the largest ones in absolute value. The time

required by the routine to ﬁnd the solutions increases very rapidly with N.

Therefore, N has to be taken as low as possible. From RPA we know that the

excitation energy of the dipole plasmon is located around 3 eV . Since we are

interested in single and double dipole plasmon excitations, we have to choose N

such that all eigenvalues up to ∼ 7 eV are determined, and this would mean

a quite large N since the states of the basis we use do not have a deﬁnite

value of the total angular momentum and spin. On the other hand, since the

hamiltonian commutes with ˆL and ˆS, its eigenvectors are also eigenvectors of

ˆL2 and ˆS2 in addition to ˆLz, ˆSz and parity. We take advantage of this and

use the following procedure to select the eigenstates of H belonging to some

deﬁnite value of the angular momentum ¯L. By running the calculation with

ML = ¯L, the eigenstates with L < ¯L are trivially eliminated. By adding to the

hamiltonian a term α[ ˆL2 − ¯L( ¯L+ 1)] with α > 0 the eigenvalues corresponding

to L > ¯L are shifted up. Therefore, if α is chosen large enough, only those with

L = ¯L are selected as the lowest ones (i.e. with the largest absolute values).

In reality one must be careful since, if α is chosen very large, the eigenvalues

corresponding to L ≫ ¯L are so much shifted up that they become positive

and the largest ones. Therefore, α has to be kept not too large and then

a few eigenvalues not corresponding to ¯L may be mixed in the region of the

spectrum we look at. However, this problem is easily eliminated by calculating

after the diagonalization the angular momentum of each eigenstate. The same

reasoning applies also for the spin and we add to the hamiltonian another term

β[ ˆS2 − ¯S( ¯S + 1)] with β > 0. The above sketched procedure is very eﬀective

and it has allowed us to limit the number of eigenvalues we are interested in

within a maximum value of 50, for each of the three cases relevant for our

scopes, namely LπS = 1−0, 0+0 and 2+0, and an excitation energy less than

6

7 eV . The energies of the lowest 12 HF sp states are reported in Table 1.

Each sp state has been expressed as superposition of h.o.w.f.’s, with principal

quantum number running from 0 to 8. The HF states are labeled by the

principal quantum number n of the predominant component and the angular

quantum number l.

For a start, we have performed two series of calculations by considering those

sp states and including all Slater determinants with up to 2p-2h and 3p-

3h conﬁgurations. By comparing the two series of results we have observed

that the 2p-2h space is far from being suﬃcient for a good description of the

states we are interested in. Indeed, the inclusion of the 3p-3h conﬁgurations

strongly modiﬁes the energies of the excited states and, to a less extent, of the

ground state (see Table II). In order to go further one has to include 4p-4h

conﬁgurations. However, in this case the number of conﬁgurations is too large

and it is necessary to introduce an energy cutoﬀ Ec, i.e. to include only those

4p-4h Slater determinants whose unperturbed energies are not higher than Ec

above the HF ground state. By repeating the calculations with Ec increasing

from Ec = 19 eV to Ec = 25 eV we get a lower and lower ground state energy

as shown in Table 2. Looking at the third column of the table, where we show

the diﬀerence between the ground state energies relative to two successive

calculations, one can conclude that a very good numerical convergence has

been reached for the ground state energy. Indeed, the values obtained with

Ec = 24 and 25 eV diﬀer only by 2 meV . However, we are also interested in

excited states having a quite high energy and convergence must be checked

also for them. In order to do that we have calculated the root mean square

value σ =

1/N

q

N
i=1 ∆2

P

i of the shifts ∆i obtained in two calculations with Ec

diﬀering by 1 eV . By considering all states having excitation energy less than

7

7 eV , for the case LπS = 0+0, we have got σ = 0.064 eV when going from

Ec = 20 eV to Ec = 21 eV while σ = 0.039 eV in going from Ec = 24 eV to

Ec = 25 eV . It is also to be noted that, in the latter case, the largest shift is

∆ = 0.046 eV corresponding to 0.7 %. Similar results have been obtained for

the 2+S = 0 and 1−S = 0 spectra.

A further comment has to be added. In order to be able to increase so much

the energy cutoﬀ for 4p-4h conﬁgurations we have followed a suggestion of Ref.

[16]. Namely, the high angular momentum 0g and 0h single particle states have

been suppressed from the basis. We have checked that, for Ec = 20 eV , the cal-

culations with and without those states give almost indistinguishable results,

more precisely a maximum shift of 0.2 % in the considered energy region. The

next two sp states above the twelve ones we have considered in the basis have

l=6 and l=7. Therefore, their inclusion should not modify the spectra. Still

above there is a 2d orbital, but its HF energy is 2.19 eV and we can reason-

ably neglect its contribution. From the above considerations we conclude that

a satisfactory convergence has been reached and the so obtained energies and

wavefunctions can be reliably used in the analysis of anharmonicities.

In order to single out the states which can be interpreted as the collective

dipole plasmon and its double excitations we have calculated the electric dipole

transition strengths from the initial states |ψi >, 0+ S = 0 and 2+ S = 0,

to the ﬁnal states |ψf >, 1− S = 0. More precisely, we have calculated the

following quantity:

|Tf i(E1)|2 = |

t(E1)
αα′ < ψf |a†

αaα′|ψi > |2 ,

Rnl,n′l′ =

r3ϕ∗

nl(r)ϕn′l′(r)dr .

The (l k Yλ k l′) in eq. (6) are the reduced matrix elements deﬁned as in Ref.

[15] and ϕnl in eq. (7) are the Hartree - Fock sp wave functions. In Fig. (1)

we report the largest |Tf i(E1)|2 values (greater than 0.8 ˚A2) obtained in the

calculation performed with 12 HF states and within the 4p-4h space with Ec

=25 eV . As we are interested in the study of the collective dipole plasmon

and its double excitations, we show only the transitions involving the 1− states

located around the single plasmon excitation energy.

The selected levels can be grouped in two “bands” based on the ground state

and on the lowest 1− S = 0 state (1−

1 ), respectively. The two bands are essen-

tially not connected by dipole transitions. The second 1− S = 0 state (1−

2 ) at

3.07 eV excitation energy is strongly coupled to the ground state and can be

identiﬁed with the dipole plasmon excitation. The only three excited states

having a large dipole transition strength to this (1−

2 ) state are two 2+ S = 0

states, at 6.41 and 6.42 eV , and one 0+ S = 0 state at 6.60 eV , corresponding

to an energy jump of 3.34, 3.35 eV and 3.53 eV respectively, to be compared

with the 3.07 eV excitation energy of the (1−

2 ) state. They might be identiﬁed

as corresponding to double excitations of the dipole plasmon. Indeed, they

are very close to each other and their energy is not far from twice that of the

single plasmon. The deviations from the harmonic limit are of the order of

10%. As can be seen from the ﬁgure, the strength of the transition connecting

the (1−

2 ) state to the two-plasmon states is 12.12 ˚A2 to be compared with the

9

harmonic value of 12.36 ˚A2 corresponding to the double of the one-plasmon

strength. We also note that this strength is fragmented between the 2+ S = 0

and 0+ S = 0 states in a proportion close to the harmonic limit, i.e. 4/3 and

2/3 respectively.

The 2+ S = 0 and 0+ S = 0 having a strong transition to the (1−

1 ) state

(see the “lateral band” in the ﬁgure) lie at 3.40 eV and 3.65 eV above it.

This makes plausible their interpretation as collective dipole excitations built

on top of the (1−

1 ) state, all these states being characterized by an intrinsic

motion wave function φ01 (see eq. (1)). This also justiﬁes the extremely small

value (0.002 ˚A2) of the transition strength between the ground state and the

(1−

1 ) state.

The quality of the results obtained in the present calculations can be judged

by looking at sum rules. It is well known [6] that, if |0i and |νi are the exact

ground and excited states of a system, then the following equality holds

(Eν − E0)|hν|Tλ|0i|2 =

hν|[Tλ, [H, Tλ]]|0i ,

(8)

Xν

1
2

where H is the total hamiltonian and Tλ the transition operator of multipo-

larity λ. The r.h.s. of the above equation can be evaluated exactly and is (see

eq. (2.47) of Ref. [15])

EW SR =

~2λ(2λ + 1)2
8πm

Nehr2λ−2i ,

(9)

where m is the mass of the electron and hr2λ−2i is the expectation value of

the indicated quantity in the ground state. Since we are looking at λ = 1

transitions, the EWSR is completely independent of the ground state and is

equal to 21.83 ˚A2 · eV . The l.h.s. of eq. (8) turns out to be 21.62 ˚A2 · eV which

is 99.04% of EWSR. Therefore, we can conclude that our calculated energies

10

and wavefunctions satisfy up to an extremely good level this very stringent

condition. In order to further check the numerical convergence we have com-

pared the results obtained with 12 HF orbitals and cutoﬀ energies equal to

Ec = 22, 23, 24, 25 eV , ﬁnding a smaller and smaller variation at each step,

the last one being 0.06 ˚A2 · eV , i.e. 0.2 %. It is also worth mentioning that

the contribution of the second 1− state to the sum is 19.01 ˚A2 · eV , which

means 87% of the total. Therefore, its identiﬁcation with the collective dipole

plasmon state is very well justiﬁed.

By summarizing, in this work we have carried out a microscopic analysis of

the ground and excited states of the Na8 metal cluster within the jellium

model. We have performed a series of conﬁguration interaction calculations

in a Hartree-Fock basis and constructed eigenstates of the Hamiltonian which

carry up to 4-particle 4-hole components. Based on the analysis of the dipole

transition strengths, we have singled out those states which can be interpreted

as the collective dipole plasmon and its double excitations. These modes have

been found to possess a high degree of harmonicity, deviations from the har-

monic limit remaining, however, of the order of 10%. These values are consis-

tent with the anharmonicities found by Gerchicov et al. [9], using a diﬀerent

technique, in heavier clusters. We want to stress that in principle a conﬁg-

uration interaction calculation is the most accurate approach to reproduce

the spectrum of the system and then to evaluate its anharmonicities. On the

other side, a limitation of this kind of calculations is that they are very heavy

numerically and this is the reason why we limited our analysis to the small

cluster Na8.

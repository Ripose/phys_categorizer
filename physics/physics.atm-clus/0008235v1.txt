Emergence of Bulk CsCl Structure in (CsCl)nCs+ Cluster Ions

Departamento de F´ısica Te´orica, Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid 47011, Spain

Andr´es Aguado

The emergence of CsCl bulk structure in (CsCl)nCs+ cluster ions is investigated using a mixed
quantum-mechanical/semiempirical theoretical approach. We ﬁnd that rhombic dodecahedral frag-
ments (with bulk CsCl symmetry) are more stable than rock-salt fragments after the completion of
the ﬁfth rhombic dodecahedral atomic shell. From this size (n=184) on, a new set of magic numbers
should appear in the experimental mass spectra. We also propose another experimental test for this
transition, which explicitely involves the electronic structure of the cluster. Finally, we perform more
detailed calculations in the size range n=31–33, where recent experimental investigations have found
indications of the presence of rhombic dodecahedral (CsCl)32Cs+ isomers in the cluster beams.

I. INTRODUCTION

A general goal of cluster physics is to study the emer-
gence of bulk behavior right from the molecular limit,
by building clusters of increasing size and following the
size evolution of selected properties. From the theoret-
ical point of view, this ambitious plan has been largely
impeded because of the slow and nonmonotonic size evo-
lution observed in many properties. The predicted clus-
ter structures are not simply related to the correspond-
ing bulk structures in many cases, which precludes the
possibility of a meaningful extrapolation to the bulk
limit. Moreover, cluster structure is diﬃcult to de-
termine theoretically due to the huge increase in the
number of isomers with size, and experimentally due to
the small number of scatterers compared with the bulk
case. Nevertheless, recent advances involving ion mobil-
ity measurements,1–4 electron diﬀraction from trapped
cluster ions,5,6 or the use of photoelectron spectra as a
ﬁngerprint of structure7 have been successful in elucidat-
ing the structures of several ionic and covalent clusters.
Abundance patterns obtained from the mass spec-
tra of binary ionic clusters like the alkali halides and
alkaline-earth oxides point towards a prompt establish-
ment of bulk rock-salt symmetry.8–11 Theoretical calcu-
lations have shown, however, that small sodium iodide
and lithium halide clusters adopt ground state struc-
tures based on the stacking of hexagonal rings.12,13 In
the case of alkaline-earth oxide clusters, the large and
coordination-dependent values of the oxide polarizabili-
ties favor the formation of structures with a large pro-
portion of ions in surface sites, inducing a delay in the
emergence of bulk structural properties.14–16 Turning to
the alkali halides, bulk CsCl, CsBr, and CsI crystal-
lize in the CsCl-type structure, while both experimen-
tal mass spectra8,10 and theoretical calculations17 indi-
cate that small clusters of those materials adopt ground
state structures which are fragments of a rock-salt lat-
tice. This implies that there has to be a structural
phase transition as the cluster size is increased. Ion mo-
bility measurements performed by L¨oﬄer4 suggest that
(CsCl)nCs+ cluster ions with n=32 are specially com-
pact, which might be explained by the presence of isomers
with the shape of a perfect three-shell rhombic dodeca-

1

hedron (that is with bulk CsCl symmetry) in the cluster
beam. The electron diﬀraction experiments performed
recently in the group of Parks6 show that there is a sub-
stantial proportion of isomers with bulk CsCl symmetry
for the same size.

In this theoretical work we analyce the above men-
tioned size-induced phase transition in (CsCl)nCs+ clus-
ter ions. We consider only those sizes that correspond
to geometrical shell closings for the CsCl-type (per-
fect rhombic dodecahedra with n=32,87,184,335,552) and
rock-salt (perfect cubes with n=13,62,171,364,665) struc-
tural series. In doing so, we try to avoid any nonmono-
tonic size evolution in the calculated properties. In the
upper part of Fig. 1 we display the relative number of
atoms with a given coordination as a function of N−1/3,
where N=2n+1 is the total number of atoms in the clus-
ter.
In the lower part we show the number of atoms
with nonbulk coordination relative to the total number
of surface atoms. For the largest sizes considered the
proportion of bulklike atoms is dominant, and within the
surface the proportion of face-like atoms is already much
larger than those of edge and vertex-like atoms. From
those sizes to the bulk, the only meaningful size evo-
lution of these proportions will be a slow approach to
zero of the face-like atoms. We thus expect to capture
all the physical information relevant to the phase transi-
tion by studying this set of clusters and the correspond-
ing bulk phases, which have been studied both with the
same theoretical model. In this way inaccuracies related
to the use of diﬀerent methodologies are avoided and a
meaningful extrapolation to the bulk limit can be done.18
In a second part of the work, we explicitely analyze the
structures adopted by (CsCl)nCs+ cluster ions in the size
range n=31–33, in order to explain the experimental ﬁnd-
ings of Refs. 4 and 6.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II
includes just a brief description of the theoretical model
employed in the calculations, as a full account of it has
been given in previous publications.12,15,16 In Section III
we present and discuss the results of the calculations, and
Section IV summarizes the main conclusions.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

III. RESULTS

Cluster energies have been obtained by performing
Perturbed Ion (PI) plus polarization calculations. This
is a well tested method that describes accurately both
bulk19 and cluster15,16 limits. Its theoretical foundation
lies in the theory of electronic separability.20–22 Very
brieﬂy, the cluster wave function is broken into local
group functions (ionic in nature in our case) that are
optimised in a stepwise procedure. In each iteration, the
total energy is minimized with respect to variations of the
electron density localized in a given ion, with the electron
densities of the other ions kept frozen. In the subsequent
iterations each frozen ion assumes the role of nonfrozen
ion. When the self-consistent process ﬁnishes,12 the out-
puts are the total cluster energy and a set of localized
wave functions, one for each geometrically nonequivalent
ion of the cluster. This procedure leads to a linear scal-
ing of the computational eﬀort with cluster size, which
allows the investigation of large clusters with an explicit
inclusion of the electronic structure. The cluster binding
energy can be decomposed into ionic additive contribu-
tions

being ER
add the contribution of the ion R to the total clus-
ter energy and ER
0 the energy of the ion R in vacuo. In
this way the contribution of ions with diﬀerent coordina-
tions to the binding energy can be separately analyzed,
which is particularly convenient for our study. Each ad-
ditive energy can be decomposed in turn as a sum of
deformation and interaction terms

where ER
def is the self-energy of the ion R, measured
relative to the vacuum state, and ER
int contains electro-
static, exchange and repulsive overlap energy terms.12,15
The polarization contribution to the cluster binding en-
ergy is not computed in the actual version of the PI
code, as it assumes (for computational simplicity) that
the electronic charge distribution of each ion in the clus-
ter is spherically symmetric. Thus, a polarization cor-
rection to the PI energy is computed semiempirically as
described in Refs. 15,16. Bulk polarizabilities are used
for both Cs+ and Cl− ions.23 This is a good approx-
imation for the Cs+ cations. The main eﬀect on the
anion polarizabibities when passing from the bulk to a
cluster environment is an increase of the polarizabilities
of those ions located on the cluster surface, due to the
lower average coordination compared to the bulk. How-
ever, we have checked that our main conclusions are not
aﬀected by an increase in the surface chloride polariz-
abilities as large as 10–20 %, which are typical values for
halides.14 The short-range induction damping parame-
ters have been obtained through the scaling procedure
validated in Ref. 24. The reliability for cluster calcu-
lations of the mixed quantum-mechanical/semiempirical
energy model thus obtained has been checked and shown
to be high in previous publications.15,16

A. The rock-salt to CsCl-type structural transition

Fig. 2 shows the size evolution of the binding energy
per ion. First of all, we note that the PI model prop-
erly reproduces the stability trend in the bulk, predict-
ing the CsCl structure as the most stable one. This is
a tough problem for semiempirical methods, as Pyper25
has shown that a full account of the coordination number
dependence of the self-energy and overlap contributions
is necessary to obtain the correct ground state structure.
The values of the binding energy, plotted as a function
of N−1/3, lie neatly on a straight line. The regression
coeﬃcients obtained from a ﬁt are 0.9998 in all cases if
we exclude from the ﬁtting the NaCl-type cluster with
n=13, which is the smallest one. We have calculated af-
ter the ﬁtting procedure the energy of the 5×5×7 cuboid
(also included in Fig. 2), and checked that it lies on the
ﬁtted NaCl-type energy curve. This shows that a consid-
eration of perfect cubes (or cuboids) on one hand, and
rhombic dodecahedra on the other hand removes the non-
monotonic behavior from the size evolution of the binding
energies. Our results predict that the rhombic dodeca-
hedra become deﬁnitely more stable after the completion
of the ﬁfth shell of atoms, that is for n=184. The four-
shell rhombic dodecahedron and the 5×5×7 cuboid are
essentially degenerate, so both of them will contribute
to the enhanced abundance observed experimentally for
n=87.10 We have not found any experimental mass spec-
trum for values of n as high as 184, but we predict that
a new set of magic numbers, corresponding to the clos-
ing of rhombic dodecahedral atomic shells, should emerge
from this size on. The magic numbers corresponding to
the closing of perfect cubic shells will probably not dis-
appear still at that speciﬁc size from the mass spectra,
because they do not coincide with the CsCl shell closings,
and complete cubes can remain more stable than incom-
plete rhombic dodecahedra until larger values of n are
reached. Polarization has little inﬂuence on these gen-
eral results, and only aﬀects the energetic ordering of the
two essentially degenerate isomers mentioned above.

Now we turn to an analysis of the physical factors re-

binding energy per ion, averaged over subsets of ions
with a ﬁxed coordination. The contribution of bulklike
ions to the binding energy favors always the formation of
CsCl-type structures. However, the contribution of face-
like ions favors the formation of rock-salt fragments. As
soon as the proportion of bulk ions is larger than that
of surface atoms, which occurs after the completion of
the ﬁfth rhombic dodecahedral atomic shell, fragments
of the CsCl-type lattice become more stable. The energy
contribution of those ions in edge positions is approxi-
mately the same for both structural families except for
the smallest clusters; ﬁnally, corner atoms favor the CsCl-
type structures, but their small relative number results
in a very small contribution to the total energy for those
sizes where the transition occurs.

Fig. 3 has reduced the structural phase transition in
(CsCl)nCs+ cluster ions to an essentially bulk eﬀect. By

this we mean that CsCl-type structures become more sta-
ble as soon as the proportion of bulklike atoms is dom-
inant. To complete our discussion we have then to ad-
dress the stability question in the bulk. This is more
easily understood by analyzing the reasons why other al-
kali halides like NaCl or CsF do not crystallize in the
CsCl-type lattice. The largest contribution to the bind-
ing energy of an ionic crystal is the Madelung energy term
EM = AM
, with AM the Madelung constant and Re the
Re
equilibrium interionic distance. The Madelung constant
of the CsCl-type lattice (1.762675) is larger than that of
the rock-salt lattice (1.747565), so were the value of Re
the same for both structures, the CsCl-type would always
be more stable. We have solved for the electronic struc-
ture of NaCl and CsF crystals in the CsCl-type struc-
ture at a nonequilibrium value of the interionic distance,
chosen in such a way that the Madelung energy term is
exactly the same as in the corresponding rock-salt lattice
In the case of NaCl, Eadd(Na+) favors
at equilibrium.
the CsCl-type structure, but Eadd(Cl−) largely favors the
rock-salt phase. The main reason is the large anion-anion
overlap at that artiﬁcial distance, that is the Na+ cation
is so small compared to the Cl− anion that eight an-
ions can not be packed eﬃciently around a cation.
In
CsF the situation is reversed, and it is the cation-cation
overlap that is too large. This demonstrates that the sta-
bility situation in the bulk is a purely packing eﬀect: in
CsCl, CsBr and CsI, the large value of the cation-anion
size ratio allows for an equilibrium interionic approach
in the CsCl-type structure close enough as to obtain a
Madelung energy term more negative than in the rock-
salt phase, without a large overlap interaction between
like ions. The same is true for the bulklike ions in the
clusters studied, and so when those ions begin to domi-
nate the energetics, the bulklike fragments become more
stable.

We have made a prediction above that can be tested
experimentally, namely the emergence of a new set of
magic numbers from n=184 on. Here we propose an-
other, perhaps more indirect, experimental test. In Fig.
4, the eigenvalues of the 3p orbitals of Cl− (with opposite
sign) are plotted as a function of N−1/3. We have a band
of eigenvalues for each size because the anions occupy
nonequivalent positions in the clusters. As the clusters
under study are formed by closed shell ions whose wave
functions are strongly localized, it can be assumed that
an electron is extracted from a speciﬁc localized orbital
when the cluster is ionized. This is the lowest bound
3p orbital, which corresponds always to a chloride anion
with a low coordination. Thus the dashed lines repre-
sent the size evolution of the vertical ionization potential
IP (in the Koopmans’ approximation) for both structural
families. For the rock-salt series, that size evolution is ap-
proximately linear in N−1/3, but for the CsCl-type series
it shows a more or less oscillating behavior, which should
be detected in experimental measurements of the vertical
IP if rhombic dodecahedra actually are the ground state
structures from a given size on. We can explain these dif-
ferent electronic behaviors in a very simple way: in the
rock-salt clusters the eight corner sites are always occu-
pied by Cs+ cations. The weakest bound electron corre-

sponds always to a Cl− anion with fourfold coordination,
namely anyone of those closer to the corner cation sites.
On the other hand, rhombic dodecahedra have fourteen
corner sites. When the number of atomic shells is even,
all these sites are occupied by Cs+ cations, but when that
number is odd, eight of them are cationic sites and the
other six anionic sites. Thus the nonmonotonic behavior
of the vertical IP is due to the diﬀerent local coordination
of the Cl− anion to which the weakest bound electron is
attached as the number of atomic shells increases.

B. Structures of (CsCl)nCs+ (n=31–33) and

comparison to experiment

We ﬁnish our study with an explicit consideration of
(CsCl)nCs+ clusters in the size range n=31–33, the range
covered in the experiments of L¨oﬄer4 and Parks.6 Specif-
ically, we have considered the most compact 7×3×3,
4×4×4 and 5×4×3 rock-salt structures, and the three-
shell rhombic dodecahedron, with some atoms added or
removed from diﬀerent positions. The binding energies
are shown in Table I. The ground state (GS) structure of
(CsCl)31Cs+ is a complete 7×3×3 cuboid. The 4×4×4
fragment with an anion removed from a corner position is
slightly less stable, and the lowest energy rhombic dodec-
ahedral isomer we have obtained has a still lower stabil-
ity. For n=32, the complete three-shell rhombic dodeca-
hedron becomes the GS isomer. All the diﬀerent incom-
plete rock-salt fragments have a smaller binding energy.
For n=33, the diﬀerent rock-salt isomers are essentially
degenerate, but the CsCl-type structure is found again
at a higher energy. This sequence of GS structures for
(CsCl)nCs+ clusters is consistent with the experimental
ﬁndings.4,6 The relative mobility is a local maximum for
n=32, as the perfect three-shell rhombic dodecahedron
is evidently more compact than the complete 7×3×3
(CsCl)31Cs+ cuboid or any of the incomplete rock-salt
structures obtained for n=33. Also, the energetical or-
dering of the isomers is consistent with the large propor-
tion of CsCl-type isomers found for n=32 in the electron
diﬀraction experiments.

IV. SUMMARY

We have reported a computational study of the size-
induced rock-salt to CsCl-type structural phase tran-
sition in (CsCl)nCs+ cluster ions. For this purpose,
the Perturbed Ion (PI) method, supplemented with a
semiempirical account of polarization eﬀects, has been
employed. Only cluster ions with an atomic closed-shell
conﬁguration have been considered in order to avoid non-
monotonic behavior in the calculated properties. More-
over, we have employed the same theoretical model to
study both cluster and bulk limits, which allows for a
meaningful extrapolation strategy. The main result is
that rhombic dodecahedral isomers become deﬁnetely
more stable than rock-salt structures after the comple-
tion of the ﬁfth rhombic-dodecahedral atomic shell, that
is for a size n=184. Thus, it is predicted that a new set of

3

magic numbers, reﬂecting the establishment of the new
structural symmetry, should emerge from that size on.
The size evolution of the vertical ionization potential of
the cluster ions should also be a good experimental ﬁn-
gerprint of the transition. In order to explain the nature
of the transition, an analysis of the binding energy into
ionic components has been performed. The result is quite
simple: bulklike ions always prefer to have a CsCl-type
environment, even for the smallest cluster sizes (this has
been shown to be a purely packing eﬀect), while surface-
like atoms prefer to adopt rock-salt structures. The tran-
sition occurs as soon as the proportion of bulklike atoms
is large enough to dominate the energetics of the whole
cluster. One of the possibilities advanced by Parks con-
sistent with his experimental results6 is the existence of
isomers with mixed symmetry. Our results indicate that
the formation of isomers with a CsCl-type core and a
rock-salt-type surface could be energetically favored, if
the strain accumulated in the bonds at the interface re-
gion separating both phases can be conveniently relaxed.
This point deserves further investigation.

The structures adopted by (CsCl)nCs+ cluster ions
have been more carefully studied in the size range n=31–
33, which has been covered in the experimental investi-
gations. Our results are consistent with the experimental
ﬁndings, and show that the three-shell rhombic dodeca-
hedron is the lowest energy isomer for n=32.

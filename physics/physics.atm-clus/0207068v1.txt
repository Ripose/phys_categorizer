Thermal stability properties and the melting-like transition of NaN , N = 13-147, clusters are stud-
ied through microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations. The metallic bonding in the sodium
clusters is mimicked by a many-body Gupta potential based on the second moment approximation
of a tight-binding Hamiltonian. The characteristics of the solid-to-liquid transition in the sodium
clusters are analyzed by calculating physical quantities like caloric curves, heat capacities, and
root-mean-square bond length ﬂuctuations using simulation times of several nanoseconds. Distinct
melting mechanisms are obtained for the sodium clusters in the size range investigated. The calcu-
lated melting temperatures show an irregular variation with the cluster size, in qualitative agreement
with recent experimental results. However, the calculated melting point for the Na55 cluster is about
40 % lower than the experimental value.

I. INTRODUCTION

The study of the thermal stability and melting transi-
tion of sodium clusters is nowadays a very active ﬁeld of
research. This interest is motivated, in part, by the fact
that just recently it was possible to make direct compar-
isons between theoretical results, mainly extracted from
computer simulations [1–8], and experimental data [9–12]
obtained for the melting-like transition of sodium clus-
ters of diﬀerent sizes. In fact, during the last few years
the caloric curve, heat capacity, and melting tempera-
tures of NaN , N = 55-200, clusters have been measured
using the temperature dependence of the fragmentation
mass spectra [10–12]. The melting points of these clus-
ters were found to be on average 33 % (120 K) lower
than the bulk value, and more surprisingly, large varia-
tions were observed in the melting temperatures (± 30
K) with changing cluster size [11].

On the theoretical side, molecular dynamics (MD) and
Monte Carlo (MC) methods have been used to provide
microscopic descriptions on the melting mechanisms of

sodium clusters in the size range of 8-147 atoms. In these
studies, the metallic bonding of the sodium clusters has
been described using diﬀerent levels of approximation,
from empirical many-body model potentials [2,5] and
tight-binding hamiltonians [3,7] to ﬁrst-principles density
functional theory [1,4,6,8].

Despite the large amount of information obtained from
the above theoretical studies, several questions on, for
example, the irregular variations of the melting temper-
atures with respect to the cluster size remain unsolved.
One diﬃculty existing in the theoretical approaches to
study the melting-like transition of sodium clusters is re-
lated with the interplay between the geometric and elec-
tronic structure eﬀects in such systems [5,6,11]. Although
MD simulations that use density functional theory explic-
itly take into account the electronic degrees of freedom
and their eﬀects in the cluster geometry, the limitation of
this approach is related to the relatively short simulation
times (a few picoseconds) during which time-averages of
the structural and dynamical properties are calculated.
This problem, caused by the extremely large computa-

1

tional eﬀort involved in the ﬁrst-principles MD simula-
tions, is especially critical in the study of the melting
transition where large thermal ﬂuctuations are present,
and therefore much longer simulation times are required
to calculate converged time averages.

On the other hand, MD simulations based on many-
body model potentials allow extension of the simulation
time up to the nanosecond regime, employing reasonable
computational resources. However, in this case the de-
scription of the metallic bonding does not explicitly in-
clude the electronic degrees of freedom. In the present
work, we adopt the latter approach to perform molec-
ular dynamics simulation of the melting-like transition
of NaN , N = 13, 20, 55, 135, 142, and 147, clusters us-
ing a many-body Gupta potential [13–15], and simulation
times of ∼ 50 nanoseconds. The objectives of this study
are: (1) to test the phenomenological many-body Gupta
potential in the description of the melting transition us-
ing adequate simulation times and (2) to compare the
predictions of this simulation with those obtained from
the same many-body potential but using the MC method
[5,7] for the averaging procedure, and also with the re-
sults obtained from ﬁrst-principles MD [6,8] using shorter
simulation times. These tests and comparisons will pro-
vide additional insights on the melting mechanisms in
sodium clusters and provide useful information on the
performance of the diﬀerent simulation methods.

In Section II we describe the model potential and pro-
vide details on the simulation method. Results on the
caloric curves, heat capacities and thermal stability prop-
erties of diﬀerent cluster sizes are given in Sec.
III. A
summary of this work is presented in Sec. IV.

II. METALLIC POTENTIAL AND SIMULATION
PROCEDURE

The many-body model potential used in this work cor-
responds to the Gupta potential [13] that is based on the
second moment approximation of a tight-binding hamil-
tonian [14]. Its analytical expression is given by:

where r0, A, ξ, p, and q are adjustable parameters [14].
For sodium clusters these parameters have been ﬁtted
to band structure calculations [15]. Their values are:
A=0.01595 eV, ξ=0.29113 eV, r0=6.99 bohr, p=10.13,
and q=1.30 [15]. This type of potential has been exten-
sively utilized in other metal cluster simulations [16–20],

obtaining good agreement with results generated from
ﬁrst-principles methods.

In order to study the cluster melting-like transition,
we use the constant-energy MD method to calculate the
structural changes as a function of the cluster energy.
Within this method, Newton’s equations of motion are
solved for each atom within the cluster using the Verlet
algorithm [21]. Through this procedure, one obtains the
atomic positions and momenta as a function of time, that
are used to calculate time-averages of physical quantities
characterizing the cluster structure and dynamics. A typ-
ical calculation consists in heating up a cluster from its
zero temperature conﬁguration until it transforms into a
liquid-like cluster. To simulate this procedure the cluster
total energy is increased in a step-like manner by scaling
up the atomic velocities and therefore augmenting the
kinetic energy of the cluster.

The simulation starts by slightly perturbing the coor-
dinates corresponding to the lowest-energy conﬁguration
of the cluster and setting up the atomic momenta to a
zero value, in order to eliminate the translation of the
cluster center of mass and its rotational motion. The
time step of the MD runs is 2.4 fs, which provides to-
tal energy conservation within 0.001 %. For each initial
condition the cluster is equilibrated during 104 time steps
and the time averages are calculated using 107 time steps
in the solid and liquid regions, but 2 times longer simula-
tion times are used in the melting-like transition region.
This amount of averaging time is a necessary condition
to obtain converged physical quantities characterizing the
melting process in these ﬁnite systems.

To obtain the lowest-energy structure of each clus-
ter size we combine simulated quenching techniques [17]
and evolutive algorithms [22], which are able to perform
global searches of the potential energy surface (PES) in a
very eﬃcient way despite the large number of degrees of
freedom involved in the cluster structure optimization.
These methods do not only provide the lowest-energy
conﬁguration but the distribution of isomers in the low
energy range. This optimization procedure has been suc-
cessfully used in other cluster structure optimizations
[18–20,22].

The behavior of the structural and thermal properties
during the heating process of the cluster is monitored
by calculating the temperature, heat capacity, and root-
mean-square (rms) bond length ﬂuctuations as a function
of the cluster total energy using the following expressions:

above mathematical expressions were introduced in Refs.
[23,24] in order to calculate structural and thermal prop-
erties of clusters from computer simulation studies.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Na13

The lowest-energy conﬁguration of the Na13 cluster
corresponds to an icosahedral structure shown in Fig.
1(a). This geometry was used to initiate the heating up
procedure through the MD method. The cluster temper-
ature (caloric curve) and speciﬁc heat as a function of the
cluster total energy, calculated using Eqs. (3) and (4), are
displayed in Figs. 2(a) and 3(a), respectively. The change
in the slope of the caloric curve as well as the existence of
a maximum in the speciﬁc heat are characteristics of the
solid-to-liquid transition in clusters [23–25]. These fea-
tures are clearly seen in Figs. 2(a) and 3(a), indicating a
melting-like transition in the Na13 cluster. This transi-
tion, which occurs over a broad range of energy involving
one or more intermediate stages (such as isomerizations,
coexistence of liquidlike and solidlike phases, partial and
surface melting etc.), has been widely discussed in ear-
lier studies of atomic clusters [26]. Figure 4(a) shows the
rms bond-length ﬂuctuation, δ, as a function of the clus-
ter total energy, calculated using Eq. (5). It shows two
abrupt variations at diﬀerent energies that are in contrast
with the analog of the Lindemann criterion [27] for bulk
melting, where a single abrupt increase in δ is observed.
By performing thermal quenchings from conﬁgurations
generated at diﬀerent total energies during the MD simu-
lation, the diﬀerent melting mechanisms occurring in the
Na13 cluster can be investigated.
It is found that the
ﬁrst abrupt change in δ at low energy (temperature) is
due to cluster isomerization involving only surface atoms,
whereas the second increase at higher energy (temper-
ature) corresponds to isomerizations where the central
(bulk like) atom as well as the surface atoms are involved.
The onset of the surface and volume isomerizations occur
at T =149 and 226 K, respectively, whereas the tempera-
ture corresponding to the maximum of the speciﬁc heat
(which indicates the transition to the liquidlike state) is
at T =260 K. Similar isomerization mechanisms and tran-
sition temperature values have been obtained from MC
simulations of Na13, using the same many-body model
potential [7]. A similar melting behavior has also been
obtained for Ni13 and Al13 through MD simulations using
the Gupta potential [25,28]. Nevertheless, this melting
mechanism is not exclusive of metal clusters interacting
by a many-body Gupta potential since both surface and

volume isomerizations have also been obtained for a 13-
atom cluster modeled by a pair-wise additive potential
with a soft repulsive core interaction [29].

B. Na20

The double icosahedron with a capped atom over the
central pentagonal ring displayed in Fig.
1(b) corre-
sponds to the lowest-energy structure of Na20. By heat-
ing up this cluster we obtain the caloric curve and speciﬁc
heat displayed in Figs. 2(b) and 3(b), and the rms bond
length ﬂuctuation shown in Fig. 4(b). In addition to the
slight change in the slope of the caloric curve at low en-
ergies, the speciﬁc heat shows a shoulder at low energy
(temperature), before it reaches its maximum at higher
energy (temperature). A very abrupt increase in the δ
value is obtained at low energy that corresponds, accord-
ing to the caloric curve, to a cluster temperature of 57
K. A second abrupt increase in δ at around 157 K is also
obtained after further heating of Na20.

The microscopic features characterizing this melt-
ing behavior can be extracted by performing periodic
quenchings using the cluster conﬁgurations along the
MD run at a given cluster energy. The analysis of the
quenched cluster structures indicate that the ﬁrst abrupt
increase in δ, that is in correspondence with the shoulder
in the speciﬁc heat at low energies, is related with iso-
merization transitions where the extra atom incorporates
into the cluster surface, generating a ﬂuctuating six-atom
ring in the central region of the cluster structure. This
isomerization is equivalent to a surface reconstruction of
the icosahedral surface without diﬀusion. The second
jump in δ is associated to a surface melting stage where
the double icosahedron transforms into a more compact
structure containing two internal atoms. At higher ener-
gies (temperatures) complete melting is observed, char-
acterized by diﬀusive motion where the δ value levels
oﬀ. The two abrupt increases in δ obtained for Na20 are
equivalent to those described for Na13, except that in
the larger cluster the ﬁrst increase corresponds to an iso-
merization due to the outer atom lying over the cluster
surface. These phenomena occurring in Na13 and Na20
before they fully melt, showing atomic diﬀusion, can be
denominated as a premelting stage.

The premelting phenomenon was ﬁrst obtained in MD
simulations of Ni14 and Ni20 [30–32] and some BeN ,
N =9,11,12,14, clusters [33]. Later, other metal clusters
with magic and non-magic number sizes also reveled a
premelting stage (see, for example, Refs. [7,25]). The
two-step melting transition described above was also ob-
tained using the q-jumping MC method and the Gupta
potential [5,7]. A good agreement was found in the pre-
melting and melting temperatures calculated with this
approach [5,7]. However, higher temperature values, for

3

the two transitions, were found by ﬁrst-principles orbital-
free MD on Na20 [6], which might be due to the much
shorter simulation time used in such calculation.

C. Na55

Figure 1(c) shows the lowest-energy conﬁguration of
Na55 corresponding to the two-shell Mackay icosahedron.
The caloric curve and speciﬁc heat obtained by heating
up this structure are displayed in Figs. 2(c) and 3(c),
respectively. Figure 4(c) shows the rms-bond length ﬂuc-
tuation where an abrupt increase is observed at a total
energy that, according to the caloric curve, indicates a
melting temperature of 151 K, whereas the maximum in
the speciﬁc heat is obtained at a slightly higher temper-
ature of 166 K. In contrast to Na13 and Na20, the Na55
cluster shows a single abrupt change in δ. However, by
visualizing the dynamical trajectories of each atom in the
cluster at the temperatures within the transition region,
we found that the melting process develops in several
stages.
In the ﬁrst one, the most external layer ﬂuc-
tuates between an incomplete and complete icosahedral
surface by expelling and receiving atoms back and forth.
At higher energies an exchange of atoms between the in-
termediate and most external layers is obseved, and with
a further increase in energy, fully melting is found, where
the central atom also contributes to the cluster diﬀusive
motion. This complex melting mechanism has been re-
cently studied in Al55 and other aluminum clusters by
introducing dynamical degrees of freedom [34].

Similar melting stages have also been obtained by MC
simulation of Na55 [5,7]. However, in those calculations
a slightly higher melting temperature of 175 K was re-
ported. The ﬁrst-principles orbital-free MD simulation
of Na55 also reported [8] a melting transition at 190 K.
Again, the smaller melting temperature obtained in the
present work might be due to the much longer simula-
tion times we have used in our MD simulations as com-
pared to those used in Ref. [8]. Nevertheless, none of
the melting temperatures calculated by us and other au-
thors [5,7,8] are in agreement with the experimental value
(320 K) reported for Na55 [12]. This discrepancy between
theory and experiment has not yet been solved since it
would require a more detailed modeling of the energy
landscape of Na55, that includes not only information
on the basins of attraction of the equilibrium structures
but also on the topology around saddle points connecting
the lowest-energy minima. Additionally, in a more de-
tailed description of the potential energy surface it would
be possible that the global minimum for Na55 does not
correspond to the icosahedral structure but to an un-
known special geometry with larger thermal stabiltity
against melting. At present, it represents a theoretical
challenge to characterize the potential energy surface of
systems with such number of degrees of fredom using

4

ﬁrst-principles methods, however intense eﬀorts are cur-
rently being performed to solve this problem. On the
other hand, further experimental work is expected in the
near future that conﬁrms the relatively high value of the
melting temperature of the Na55 cluster [12].

D. Na135, Na142, and Na147

The global minima of the larger sodium clusters inves-
tigated in this work correspond to icosahedral structures.
The three-layer Mackay icosahedron shown in Fig. 1(f),
is the lowest-energy isomer of Na147. The lowest-energy
structures of the Na135, Na142 are incomplete icosahedra
obtained by removing 12 and 5 vertex atoms, respec-
tively, from the 147 Mackay icosahedron (see Figs. 1(d)
and 1(e), respectively). Despite the existence of an in-
complete surface layer in the lowest-energy structure of
Na135, Na142, they show caloric curves, Figs. 2(d-e), and
rms bond-length ﬂuctuations, Figs. 4(d-e), very similar
to those obtained by heating up the complete icosahe-
dron structure of the 147-atom cluster, Figs. 2(f) and
4(f). The calculated melting temperatures obtained us-
ing the Lindemann criterion (δ ∼ 0.15) for Na135, Na142,
and Na147 are 135 K, 190 K, and 171 K, respectively.
These values are smaller than those obtained from the
maximum of the speciﬁc heat (see Table I). By visualiz-
ing the atomic coordinates as a function of time at the
energies where the δ values change abruptly, it is ob-
served that the melting is initiated at the cluster surface.
For the three sizes investigated, the atomic mobility in-
creases with temperature starting from the most exter-
nal layer and propagating into the internal layers. This
stage, known as surface melting [32], precedes the com-
plete cluster melting characterized by the diﬀusive mo-
tion of all the atoms in the cluster which is observed at
temperatures where the speciﬁc heat is maximum.

Our calculated melting temperatures for these larger
sodium clusters are lower than those obtained by other
authors using the MC method with the same potential
[5,7] and the orbital free MD simulations [8]. This diﬀer-
ence, as in the smaller cluster sizes, we assume is due to
the much longer simulation times we have used in our MD
calculations. On the other hand, although our results
show that the largest melting temperature corresponds
to the Na142 cluster, in agreement with the experimental
data [11,12], the absolute values of our calculated melting
temperatures are about 30 % lower than the experimen-
tal values [11,12]. These results indicate that the many-
body Gupta potential, which does not include electronic
degrees of freedom, only provide a qualitative description
of the melting of sodium clusters.

IV. SUMMARY

The melting-like transition of NaN , N = 13, 20, 55,
135, 142, and 147, has been investigated through mi-
crocanonical MD simulations using a phenomenological
many-body Gupta potential. The solid-to-liquid transi-
tion was studied by calculating caloric curves, rms bond-
length-ﬂuctuations and speciﬁc heats. The indicators of
the cluster melting correspond to changes in the slope of
the caloric curve, abrupt increases in the δ values, and
the existence of maxima in the speciﬁc heats. Table I
shows the melting temperatures calculated for all clus-
ter sizes using those criteria. The main features com-
ing out from these data are: (i ) The melting temper-
atures calculated from the maxima of the speciﬁc heats
are systematically higher than the values obtained using
the Lindemann criterion. (ii ) There is an irregular vari-
ation in the melting temperatures as a function of the
cluster size, the highest value being the one correspond-
ing to the Na142 cluster. These results are in qualitative
agreement with the experimental data [11,12]. (iii ) The
calculated melting temperature for the Na55 cluster is
about 40 % lower than the reported experimental value
[12]. (iv ) The melting transition in sodium clusters is
a complex phenomenon that involves several stages in
which the system undergoes diﬀerent structural changes
(isomerization, premelting and surface melting) before it
shows a diﬀusive regime characteristic of the liquidlike
phase.

A comparison of the present results with those ob-
tained using the same many-body potential and the MC
method [5,7], and with those generated from orbital-free
MD simulations [6,8], indicate that in general, the melt-
ing temperatures calculated by heating up the lowest-
energy isomer, are lower when much longer simulation
time is employed. In this work, the simulation time was
extended up to the nanosecond time regime where it is
very likely that the time-averages of the physical quanti-
ties that characterize the cluster melting might be much
better converged.

In order to obtain a better (quantitative) agreement
with the experimental results on the melting of sodium
clusters it would be necessary to either extend the sim-
ulation time in the ﬁrst-principles MD calculations or
to design a many-body potential that describes with a
higher level of approximation the complex topology of
the potential energy landscape of sodium clusters. Work
in both directions is currently under progress.

TABLE I. Binding energies (BE) in eV/atom and melting
temperatures in K calculated from the temperature value at
the maximum of the speciﬁc heat and using the Lindemann
criterion (δ ∼ 0.15). For N = 13 and 20 there are two values
due to the existence of two-stage (premelting and melting)
transitions.

FIG. 1. Lowest-energy structures of NaN , N = 13 (a); 20
(b); 55 (c); 135 (d); 142 (e); and 147 (f); clusters. The clus-
ter geometries correspond to Mackay icosahedra for N = 13,
55, and 147; a capped double icosahedron for N = 20; and
incomplete three-layer Mackay icosahedra for N = 135 and
142.

FIG. 2. Caloric curves of NaN , N = 13 (a); 20 (b); 55 (c);
135 (d); 142 (e); and 147 (f); clusters. The cluster energy
is calculated taking as reference the value of the binding en-
ergy of the most-stable (lowest-energy) conﬁguration given in
Table I.

FIG. 3. Speciﬁc heats of NaN , N = 13 (a); 20 (b); and
55 (c); clusters. The cluster energy is calculated taking as
reference the value of the binding energy of the most-stable
(lowest-energy) conﬁguration given in Table I.

FIG. 4. RMS bond-length ﬂuctuations of NaN , N = 13
(a); 20 (b); 55 (c); 135 (d); 142 (e); and 147 (f); clusters. The
cluster energy is calculated taking as reference the value of
the binding energy of the most-stable (lowest-energy) conﬁg-
uration given in Table I.

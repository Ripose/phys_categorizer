Abstract

We have developed a transferable nonorthogonal tight-binding total en-

ergy model for germanium and use it to study small clusters. The cohesive

energy, bulk modulus, elastic constants of bulk germanium can be described

by this model to considerably good extent. The calculated bulk phase di-

agram for germanium agrees well with LDA results. The geometries and

binding energies found for small Gen clusters with n = 3 − 10 are very close
to previous ab initio calculations and experiments. All these results suggest

that this model can be further applied to the simulation of germanium cluster

of larger size or with longer time scale, for which ab initio methods is much

more computational expensive.

In the past decade, tight-binding molecular dynamics (TBMD) has evolved into a power-
ful approach in the simulation of semiconductor materials1–3. In the tight-binding scheme,

although the system is still described in a quantum-mechanical manner, the computational

cost is signiﬁcantly reduced due to the parameterization of Hamiltonian matrix elements.

In many cases of material simulations, it might oﬀer a satisfactory compromise between

empirical4 and ﬁrst principle5,6 methods for modeling the interatomic interaction. As an

alternative of the accurate but costly ab initio molecular dynamics, TBMD can handle more
complicated systems with acceptable accuracy1–3.

For carbon and silicon,

there are several well established orthogonal7–9 and
nonorthogonal10–12 tight-binding models. Although the orthogonal models works well for
various bulk systems1–3, Menon found that the inclusion of the nonorthogonality of tight-

binding basis is essential for describing the geometries and binding energies of small silicon

clusters11,12. Compared to carbon and silicon, there is much fewer tight-binding models de-

veloped for germanium. Recently, M.Menon has extended the nonorthogonal tight-binding

(NTB) scheme to germanium and calculated the structures and cohesive energies of small

Gen clusters13. Although the cluster geometries obtained in Ref.[13] are generally consistent

with ab initio results, the binding energies are overestimated. In this work, we perform an

independent ﬁtting of NTB parameters for germanium, which describes binding energies of

germanium clusters better than that in Ref.[13]. This model is employed to study some bulk

properties and considerably good results are obtained.

In Menon’s NTB model11–13, the total binding energy Eb of a system with Na atoms can

be written as a sum

Eb = Eel + Erep + NaE0

(1)

Eel is the electronic band energy, deﬁned as the sum of one-electron energies ǫk for the

occupied states: Eel = Pocc

k

ǫk. In Eq.(1), a constant energy correction term NaE0 and a

repulsive interaction Erep are also included.

On nonorthogonal basis set, the eigenvalues ǫk of system are determined from the secular

2

equation:

det|Hij − ǫSij| = 0.

(2)

Here the overlap matrix elements Sij are constructed in the spirit of extended H¨uckel

theory14,

Sij =

K(ǫi + ǫj)

and the nonorthogonal Hamiltonian matrix elements by

where

Hij = Vij[1 +

S2 =

(5)

is the nonorthogonality between two sp3 bonding orbitals and K is a environment dependent

empirical parameter11.

The Hij and Sij depend on the interatomic distance through the universal parameters

Vij, which are calculated within Slater-Koster’s scheme15. The scaling of the Slater-Koster

parameters Vλλ′µ is taken to be exponential with the interatomic distance r

Vλλ′µ(r) = Vλλ′µ(d0)e−α(r−d0)

(6)

where d0 = 2.45˚A is the bond length for germanium crystal in the diamond structure16.

The repulsive energy Erep in Eq.(1) is given by the summation of pairwise potential

function χ(r):

Erep = X

χ(rij) = X

(7)

where rij is the separation between atom i and j.

In practice, we adopt the Slater-Koster hopping integrals Vλλ′µ(d0) ﬁtted from the band

structure of bulk germanium17. The on-site orbital energies ǫs, ǫp are taken from atomic

3

calculations18. The only four adjustable parameters α, K, χ0, E0 are ﬁtted to reproduce the

fundamental properties of germanium bulk and dimer. The input properties include: the

experimental values of bulk interatomic distance 2.45 ˚A16, dissociation energy 2.65 eV19 and
vibrational frequency (286±5 cm−1)20 of Ge2 dimer, as well as theoretical bond length of
Ge2 (2.375 ˚A) from accurate quantum chemistry calculation at G2(MP2) level21. The ﬁtted

parameters are given in Table I.

We can ﬁrst check the validity of the present NTB scheme by studying the fundamen-

tal properties of germanium solid in diamond phase. The obtained cohesive energy 3.58

eV/atom is very close to experimental value 3.85 eV/atom16. Furthermore, we have calcu-

lated the bulk modulus B and elastic constants C11, C12, C44 of germanium and compared

with experimental values22 in Table II. Most of the bulk elastic properties such as B, C11,

C12 are well reproduced except that the C44 is overestimated by 0.35 Mbar in our model.

FIG. 1. Cohesive energies vs. relative volume for bulk germanium in simple cubic (sc), diamond

and clathrate I phase from NTB (solid line) and LDA (open circle) calculations23.

By using the NTB scheme, we have also calculated the equation of states of germanium

in diﬀerent phases. In Fig.1, we present the zero-temperature phase diagram of the fcc, sc,

diamond and type I clathrate obtained from NTB model, along with recent LDA plane-

wave pseudopotential calculations23. It is worthy to noted that our NTB model is able to

described the energy and atomic volume of clathrate phase. The energy of clathrate I is 0.06

eV/atom higher than that of diamond phase and its relative volume is about 15% larger than

diamond phase. These results are consistent with the 0.08 eV energy diﬀerence and 15%

volume change from LDA calculation23. The success in clathrate phase is important since the

clathrate is also four-coordinated structure23. On the other hand, it is natural to ﬁnd that

the agreement between LDA and NTB scheme become worse in the high-coordinated phases

like fcc since the present model is ﬁtted from the diamond phase and dimer. However, the

relative poor description of high coordinate phase will not inﬂuence the study on germanium

6

clusters since such high coordination (∼ 12) does not exist in the geometries of germanium
clusters. Considering its extreme simplicity and small number of adjustable parameters, the

current NTB scheme gives a suﬃcient satisfactory overall description of bulk germanium

properties. Therefore, one can expect that the model to give a reasonable description on

the germanium clusters.

In this paper, we determine the lowest energy structures of the Gen clusters with n =

3 − 10 by using TBMD full relaxation. The ground state structures of Gen (n = 5 − 10)
are presented in Fig.2 and the geometrical parameters of small Gen (n = 3 − 7) clusters are
compared with previous ab initio calculations24–27 in Table III. In general, both the lowest

energy structures and their characteristic bond length agree well with ab initio results. A

brief description is given in the following.

The minimum energy structure found for Ge3 is an isosceles triangle (C2v) with bond

length 2.38 ˚A and apex angle θ = 69.5◦, in agreement with ab initio calculations (see Table

III for comparison). The linear chain has higher total energy of about 0.95 eV.

The ground state structure of germanium tetramer is a planar rhombus (D2h) with side

length 2.44 ˚A and minor diagonal length 2.57 ˚A. This structure has been predicted as
ground state in all ab initio calculations21,24–28 and the tight-binding bond length are close

to ab initio results.

For the Ge5, the lowest energy conﬁguration is obtained as a strongly compressed trigonal

bipyramid (D3h). The energy of structure is lower than the perfect trigonal bipyramid by

0.62 eV and the planar edge capped rhombus by 0.35 eV. The trigonal bipyramid structure
has been considered in all of the previous ab initio studies21,24–28.

In those LDA based

simulation without symmetry constraint25,26,28, the trigonal bipyramid is found to undergo

severe compression and relax to the structure in Fig.2.

A distorted octahedron (D4h) is obtained for Ge6 as lowest energy structure. This

structure is found to be energetically degenerated with a edge-capped trigonal bipyramid

(∆E = 0.018 eV). This result agree well with recent B3LYP and Car-Parrinello calculation

of Ge6

27,28.

In the case of Ge7, we ﬁnd a compressed pentagonal bipyramid with D5h symmetry

as ground state and energetically lower than the face capped octahedron by 0.63 eV. The

pentagonal bipyramid structure has also been obtained from LDA based simulations25,26,28.

An additional atom capped to pentagonal bipyramid of Ge7 yields the lowest energy

structure for Ge8. This structure is more stable over the bicapped octahedron by 0.08 eV.

Both of these two structures are found for Ge8 in Car-Parrinello simulation, while bicapped

octahedron is lower in energy by 0.03 eV28.

A bicapped pentagonal bipyramid is found for Ge9.

It is more stable than a capped

distorted square antiprism by 0.06 eV. The current ground state structure has been found in

Car-Parrinello simulation for Ge9

28 but it is 0.08 eV higher than the capped square antiprism

structure.

For Ge10, the tetracapped trigonal prism (C3v) is found to be most stable and 0.16 eV

lower than the bicapped square antiprism (D4d). This ground state structure is consistent

with previous LDA results26,28.

In Table IV, we compare the binding energy per atom Eb/n for Gen (n = 2−10) with the
other theoretical and available experimental results. Due to the local density approximation,

LDA calculation26,28 has systematically overestimated the cluster binding energies. The more

accurate binding energies for small germanium clusters up to ﬁve atoms has been provided

by a more sophisticated G2(MP2) computation21. Although all the empirical parameters in

our NTB model are ﬁtted from dimer and bulk solid and there is no bond counting correction

included, the experimental cohesive energies are fairly well reproduced by our calculation.

Typical discrepancy between our calculation and experiment is less than 0.1 eV for those

clusters. The successful description of binding energy within the present size range further

demonstrates the transferability of the nonorthogonal tight-binding approach. In Table IV,

we have also included the binding energies from Menon’s NTB model for Gen clusters13.

Although the geometries of Gen found in their work is almost the same as our results, the

binding energies of Gen starting from Ge5 in Ref.13 are about 0.10 ∼ 0.2 eV higher than
our results and experimental values.

In summary, a nonorthogonal tight-binding model for germanium has been developed

in this work. The transferability of the model is tested by various of bulk phases. The

agreements between NTB model and ab initio results for bulk solids and small clusters are

11

satisfactory. For most Gen cluster with n = 3 to 10, the ground state geometries from tight-

binding model coincide with those from ab initio calculation. The only exceptional cases are

Ge8 and Ge9, in which the ab initio metastable isomers are predicted as ground states by

NTB scheme. However, the energy diﬀerence between the ground state conﬁguration and

the isomer is less than 0.01 eV/atom and within the accuracy of tight-binding approach.

Therefore, the NTB model developed in this work can be applied to explore the conﬁguration

space of larger germanium clusters with n > 10, for which a global minimization at the

ab initio level is signiﬁcantly more expensive. Our further studies shall include a genetic

algorithm for sampling the phase space and ﬁnding possible low energy structural isomers of

germanium clusters. Thus, ﬁrst principle structural optimization can be performed on these

local minima structures. On the other hand, this model will be also employed to simulate

the thermodynamic properties such as melting and growth process of germanium cluster,

which require a long time scale in TBMD simulation.

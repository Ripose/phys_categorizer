The melting-like transition in sodium clusters NaN , with N=55, 92, and 142 is studied by using
constant-energy molecular dynamics simulations. An orbital-free version of the Car-Parrinello tech-
nique is used which scales linearly with system size allowing investigation of the thermal behaviour
of large clusters. The details of the melting transition are heavily dependent on the speciﬁc isomer
used as the starting conﬁguration for the heating process. An amorphous isomer of Na142 melts in
two steps, the ﬁrst one (at ≈ 130 K) being characterized by the high mobility of the atoms located
on the cluster surface, and the second, homogeneous melting (at ≈ 270 K), involves diﬀusive motion
of all the atoms across the cluster. For an icosahedral isomer those two steps are found to be much
closer in temperature (at ≈ 240 K and 270 K, respectively). For the case of Na92, the icosahedral
isomer again melts in two well deﬁned steps, surface melting at ≈ 130 K and homogeneous melting
at ≈ 240 K, whereas an amorphous isomer shows an extremely broad, featureless melting transition.
In the case of Na55, only an icosahedral isomer was investigated, which melted in a single stage
at ≈ 190 K. Our results on homogeneous melting for Na142 and Na92 are in excellent agreement
with recent experimental determinations of melting temperatures and latent heats. However, the
experimentally observed enhancement of the melting temperature around N=55 is not reproduced
by the calculations.

I. INTRODUCTION

The melting-like transition in ﬁnite clusters consisting
of a small number of atoms, although poorly understood,
is of fundamental interest as clusters are often produced
in a disordered ”liquid” state,1 and is relevant to appli-
cations of clusters, for example, the catalytic activity of
small platinum clusters depends critically on their melt-
ing temperatures.2 Recent experimental advances reveal
some details of the melting-like transition but, at the
same time, show new and interesting features. Martin3
determined the cluster size dependence of the melting
temperature Tm of large sodium clusters, composed of
thousands of atoms, by observing the vanishing of the
atomic shell structure in the mass spectra upon heat-
ing. It was concluded that Tm grows with cluster size,
but the results did not extrapolate yet to the Tm of the
bulk. Peters et al.4 performed X-ray diﬀraction experi-
ments on large Pb clusters and observed the occurrence
of surface melting before homogeneous melting. Electron
diﬀraction5 may also help in detecting a surface melting
stage.2 Haberland and coworkers6 have studied the vari-
ation with temperature of the photofragmentation spec-
tra of NaN (N=50–200) clusters, and have deduced from
it the melting temperatures of the clusters. Intriguingly,
they ﬁnd that for some cluster sizes the melting tempera-
ture is a local maximum not in exact correspondence with
either the electronic or the atomic shell closing numbers,
but bracketed by the two, suggesting that both eﬀects
are relevant to the melting process.

A number of computer simulations of melting in small
metallic and nonmetallic clusters have been reported,
the majority of which employed phenomenological inter-
atomic potentials.7–9 The use of such parameterized po-

1

tentials allows the consideration of long dynamical tra-
jectories for large clusters.8,9 Ab initio methods, which
have also been used, accurately treat the electronic struc-
ture of the cluster,10 but are much more expensive com-
putationally and are usually restricted to the study of
small clusters for short dynamical trajectories.11 Re-
cently, Rytk¨onen et al.12 have performed ab initio molec-
ular dynamics (aiMD) simulations of the melting of a
sodium cluster with 40 atoms, but such a “large” clus-
ter required the use of a fast heating rate. These aiMD
treatments use the Kohn-Sham (KS) form13 of density
functional theory (DFT), and orthogonalization of the
one-electron KS orbitals is the limiting step in their per-
formance. However, DFT shows that the total energy
of the electronic system can be expressed in terms of
just the electronic density,14 and orbital-free (OF) ver-
sions of the CP technique based on the electron den-
sity have been developed and employed, both in solid
state15,16 and cluster17–20 applications. These OF meth-
ods scale linearly with the system size allowing the study
of larger clusters for longer simulation times than typ-
ical aiMD simulations. However, quantum shell eﬀects
are neglected, so that features associated with electronic
shell closings are not reproduced.

Previously,20 we have used the orbital-free molecular
dynamics (OFMD) method to study the melting pro-
cess in small sodium clusters, Na8 and Na20, clusters
outside the range covered by Haberland’s photofragmen-
tation experiments.6 Here, we report constant energy
OFMD simulations in a study of the melting-like tran-
sition in larger clusters, Na55, Na92 and Na142, which
are within the size range covered in those experiments,
and for which a full ab initio treatment of their ther-
mal properties would be very expensive. Even for the

OFMD method those large clusters represent a substan-
tial computational eﬀort. The aim of our work is to study
the mechanisms by which the melting-like transition pro-
ceeds in these large clusters. In the next section we brieﬂy
present some technical details of the method. The results
are presented and discussed in section III and, ﬁnally,
section IV summarizes our main conclusions.

II. THEORY

The orbital-free molecular dynamics method is a Car-
Parrinello total energy scheme which uses an explicit
kinetic-energy functional of the electron density, and
has the electron density as the dynamic variable, as
opposed to the KS single particle wavefunctions. The
main features of the energy functional and the calcula-
tional scheme have been described at length in previous
work,15,17,19,20 and details of our method are as described
by Aguado et al.20 In brief, the electronic kinetic en-
ergy functional of the electron density, n(~r), corresponds
to the gradient expansion around the homogeneous limit
through second order14,21–23

The local density approximation is used for exchange and
correlation.24,25 In the external ﬁeld acting on the elec-
n v(~r − ~Rn), we take v to be the lo-
trons, Vext(~r) =
cal pseudopotential of Fiolhais et al.,26 which reproduces
well the properties of bulk sodium and has been shown
to have good transferability to sodium clusters.27

P

The cluster is placed in a unit cell of a cubic superlat-
tice, and the set of plane waves periodic in the superlat-
tice is used as a basis set to expand the valence density.
Following Car and Parrinello,10 the coeﬃcients of that
expansion are regarded as generalized coordinates of a
set of ﬁctitious classical particles, and the corresponding
Lagrange equations of motion for the ions and the elec-
tron density distribution are solved as described in Ref.
20.

The calculations for Na92 and Na142 used a supercell of
edge 71 a.u. and the energy cut-oﬀ in the plane wave ex-
pansion of the density was 8 Ryd. For Na55, the cell edge
was 64 a.u. and the energy cut-oﬀ 10 Ryd. In all cases, a
64×64×64 grid was used. Previous tests20 indicate that
the cut-oﬀs used give good convergence of bond lengths
and binding energies. The ﬁctitious mass associated to
the electron density coeﬃcients ranged between 1.0×108
and 3.3×108 a.u., and the equations of motion were in-
tegrated using the Verlet algorithm28 for both electrons

2

and ions with a time step ranging from ∆t = 0.73 ×
10−15 sec.
for the simulations performed at the lowest
temperatures, to ∆t = 0.34 × 10−15 sec. for those at the
highest ones. These choices resulted in a conservation of
the total energy better than 0.1 %.

The ﬁrst step of the simulations was the determination
of low temperature isomers for each of the three cluster
sizes. For such large clusters it is very diﬃcult to ﬁnd
the global minimum because the number of diﬀerent lo-
cal minima increases exponentially with the number of
atoms in the cluster.
Instead, one has to be satisﬁed
with structures that are approximations to the global
minimum, and we used two methods to ﬁnd these. First,
we used dynamical simulated annealing,10 by heating a
number of initial random conﬁgurations of the clusters
to 600 K and then slowly cooling them. This process
always led to amorphous structures for Na92 and Na142,
and to a nearly icosahedral structure for Na55. Secondly,
we assumed icosahedral growth. Thus, for Na142, we re-
moved ﬁve atoms from the surface of a 147 atom, three-
shell perfect icosahedron. For Na92, we constructed an
icosahedral isomer by following the growing sequence de-
scribed by Montejano-Carrizales et al,29 and for Na55 we
took a perfect two-shell icosahedron.

Several molecular dynamics simulation runs at diﬀer-
ent constant energies were performed in order to obtain
the caloric curve for each isomer. The initial positions
of the atoms for the ﬁrst run were taken by slightly de-
forming the equilibrium geometry of the low temperature
isomer. The ﬁnal conﬁguration of each run served as the
starting geometry for the next run at a diﬀerent energy.
The initial velocities for every new run were obtained by
scaling the ﬁnal velocities of the preceding run. The total
simulation times varied between 8 and 18 ps for each run
at constant energy.

A number of indicators to locate the melting-like tran-
sition were employed. Namely, the speciﬁc heat deﬁned

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The structures for the low energy isomers resulting
from the simulated annealing starting from a number
of random initial conﬁgurations for Na142 and Na92, are
amorphous arrangements. Because the complexity of the
potential energy surfaces typical of these large cluster
sizes renders the simulated annealing search unreliable,
we have doubts that these are the ground structures of
Na142 and Na92. On the other hand, it is known that the
speciﬁc isomer used to start the heating dynamics can
aﬀect signiﬁcantly the details of the melting transition.31
Therefore, we have adopted additional isomers in order
to study the inﬂuence of the initial structure on clus-
ter melting. For Na142, another isomer was obtained
by removing ﬁve sodium atoms from a perfect three-
shell icosahedron. The icosahedral growing sequence in
nickel clusters has been studied by Montejano-Carrizales
et al,29 and they have shown that the 12 vertices of the
outermost shell are the last sites to be occupied. As-
suming the same growth sequence for sodium clusters,
we have removed ﬁve atoms from the vertex positions of
Na147, considering all possibilities, and have then radially
relaxed the resulting structure. In the most stable struc-
ture thus formed, the ﬁve vacancies form a pentagon.
For Na92, we have adopted the umbrella growing model
of Montejano-Carrizales et al.29 The resulting structure,
also radially relaxed, corresponds to three complete um-
brellas on top of a perfect Na55 icosahedron. Calculated
low-temperature dynamical trajectories verify that these
structures are indeed stable isomers of Na92. An impor-
tant diﬀerence between the icosahedral and amorphous
structures is that the former has a much smoother sur-
face. The icosahedral isomers are ∼ 0.017–0.020 eV/atom
more stable than the amorphous. The presence of amor-
phous structures in the potential energy surface, within
an energy range of ∼ 0.01 eV/atom of the ground state,
has been predicted by Garz´on and coworkers32 for gold
clusters of intermediate size, the amorphous structures
were found to be the global minima for a number of
cluster sizes. For Na55, the simulated annealing resulted
in a slightly distorted two-shell icosahedron, and only
this isomer was considered for that cluster size. Calvo
and Spiegelmann have studied the low-energy isomers of
sodium clusters in the same size range, both through pair
potential and tight-binding (TB) calculations,9 and have
also found icosahedral structures for Na55, Na93, Na139
and Na147.

For each cluster we have calculated the total energy
as a function of the internal temperature, deﬁned as the
average of the ionic kinetic energy20 - the so-called caloric
curve. A thermal phase transition is indicated in the
caloric curve by a change of slope, the slope being the
speciﬁc heat; the height of the step gives an estimate of
the latent heat of fusion. However, melting processes are
more easily recognised as peaks in the speciﬁc heat as a
function of temperature calculated directly from eq. (4)
and shown in ﬁg. 1.

The speciﬁc heat curves for Na142 (ﬁg. 1a) display
two peaks indicating a two-step melting process. For the
amorphous cluster these steps are widely separated at the

s ≈ 240 K and Tico

s ≈ 130 K and Tam

temperatures Tam
m ≈ 270 K, but much
closer together for the icosahedral Na142 cluster at tem-
peratures Tico
m ≈ 270 K, close enough
so that only one slope change in the caloric curve can be
distinguished in this case. The results suggest that the
melting transition in Na142 starts at a temperature Ts
and ﬁnishes at Tm with the diﬀerence in the melting of
the two isomers being only the much smaller Ts value for
the amorphous isomer. Homogeneous melting occurs at
T=Tm ≈ 270 K in both cases, a result in excellent agree-
ment with the experiments of Haberland and coworkers,6
who give an approximate value of 280 K. The estimated
latent heat of fusion is qm ≈ 15 meV/atom consistent
with the experimental value of ∼ 14 meV/atom. How-
ever, the premelting stage at T=Ts is not detected in
the experiments. Our results for the icosahedral isomer
could be consistent with this because the two speciﬁc heat
peaks are close to one another and the height of the ﬁrst
is much smaller than that of the second; consequently
they could be indistinguishable experimentally. Calvo
and Spiegelmann9 have performed Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations using a semiempirical many-atom potential.
The lowest-energy isomer they found for Na139 was also a
defective three-shell icosahedron, in this case with 8 sur-
face vacancies. They also report two close peaks in the
speciﬁc heat curve indicating a two-step melting process,
with Ts ≈ 210 K and Tm ≈ 230 K. They concluded
that those two temperatures get closer as the cluster
size increases, so that for clusters in this size range one
can consider in practical terms just one peak in the spe-
ciﬁc heat and a single melting temperature. Tight bind-
ing molecular dynamics calculations were performed by
the same authors.9 Although the speciﬁc values obtained
for the melting temperatures through the tight-binding
methodology are diﬀerent from those obtained with the
phenomenological simulations (they tend to overestimate
the experimental values, while empirical potentials tend
to underestimate them), the qualitative picture of melt-
ing in two close steps is the same in both methods.

The results for Na92 are shown in ﬁg. 1b. The melting
of the amorphous isomer proceeds over a broad temper-
ature interval, and there are no signiﬁcant peaks in the
speciﬁc heat or slope changes in the caloric curve. The
latent heat is close to zero; something that had been
found previously for some amorphous gold clusters.33
These results are in disagreement with the experiments
of Haberland et al.6 In contrast the icosahedral isomer
shows two-step melting with a prepeak at Ts ≈ 130
K and homogeneous melting at Tm ≈ 240 K. In this
case Ts and Tm are well separated, but the ﬁrst peak
is much smaller than the second which could again ac-
count for the absence of the prepeak in the experiments,
although alternatively we may not yet have found the
ground state structure. Nevertheless, the calculated val-
ues for the homogeneous melting stage: Tm ≈ 240 K
and qm ≈ 8 meV/atom, are in excellent agreement with
the experimental values,6 250 K and 7 meV/atom respec-
tively. Calvo and Spiegelmann9 have performed MC sim-
ulations for Na93 with similar conclusions, ﬁnding (with
phenomenological potentials) a small bump near 100 K
and a main peak near 180 K. The TB simulations give

3

values for those two temperatures roughly 100 K higher.
The experiments6 indicate a substantial enhancement
of the melting temperature in the size region around
N=55 atoms. The reported melting temperature of Na+
55
is 325 K, surprisingly, higher than that of Na142, which
is a local maximum in the size region close to the third
icosahedral shell closing (Na147). Our simulations do not
reproduce this enhancement of Tm and predict that Na55
melts in a single stage at Tm ≈ 190 K (ﬁg. 1c), a re-
sult found also by Calvo and Spiegelmann.9 The OFMD
method does not account for electronic quantum-shell ef-
fects, and full KS calculations may be needed in order to
clarify this discrepancy, although it is not clear a priori
how quantum eﬀects could shift the value of Tm by such
a large amount. Of course, another possibility is that the
icosahedron is not the ground state. However, K¨ummel
et al34 have recently found that the experimental pho-
toabsorption spectrum of Na+
55 is best reproduced with a
slightly oblate isomer which is close to icosahedral. We
have also investigated a bcc-like growing sequence ﬁnding
that bcc structures are less stable than icosahedral ones
for all cluster sizes studied. Nevertheless, we checked
the melting behavior of a Na55 isomer with bcc structure
and did not ﬁnd an enhanced melting temperature for it
either.

Various parameters have been calculated in order to in-
vestigate the nature of the melting transitions. The long
time behaviour of the mean square atomic displacements
given by eq. (5), gives information about diﬀusion. For
both Na92 and Na142 clusters at temperatures less than
Ts < r2(t) > has zero slope at long times, indicating
only oscillatory motion of the atoms. For temperatures
between Ts and Tm the slope of < r2(t) > at large times
gives the diﬀusion coeﬃcient which, we ﬁnd, is larger for
the amorphous structure than for the icosahedral isomer.
At temperatures above Tm the slopes are similar for the
amorphous and icosahedral clusters and the diﬀusion is
appreciably faster as appropriate for a liquid.

The short-time averages (sta) of the distances between
each atom and the instantaneous center of mass of the
cluster, < ri(t) >sta, have been calculated, and the clus-
ter evolution during the trajectories has been followed vi-
sually using computer graphics. The < ri(t) >sta curves
for Na142 are presented in Figs. 2-4 for three represen-
tative temperatures. At low temperature (Fig. 2) the
values of < ri(t) >sta are almost independent of time
(the curves for the two isomers of Na92 are qualitatively
similar to those for Na142 and are omitted; the curves
for Na55 are similar to those of the two inner shells of
the icosahedral Na142 isomer). The movies show that
the clusters are solid, the atoms just vibrating around
their equilibrium positions. Curve crossings are due to
oscillatory motion and slight structural relaxations rather
than diﬀusive motion. A substantial diﬀerence between
the behaviour of the icosahedral and amorphous clus-
ters at low temperature is seen by comparing Figs. 2a
and 2b. For the former we can distinguish quasidegen-
erate groups which are characteristic of the symmetry:
one line near the centre of mass of the cluster identiﬁes
the central atom (its position does not exactly coincide
with the center of mass because of the location of the

s

At T=160 K, a temperature between Tam

ﬁve surface vacancies); 12 lines correspond to the ﬁrst
icosahedral shell; another 42 complete the second shell,
within which we can distinguish the 12 vertex atoms from
the rest because their distances to the centre of mass are
slightly diﬀerent; ﬁnally, 82 lines describe the external
shell, where again we can distinguish the 7 vertex atoms
from the rest. In contrast, the lines for the amorphous
isomer in Fig. 2b are quite dispersed. Similar results to
these have been reported by Garz´on et al.32 for icosa-
hedral and amorphous gold clusters. The radial density
distributions ρ(r) for Na142 are shown in Fig. 5a and 5b
for the icosahedral and amorphous isomers respectively.
At the lowest temperature, T=30 K, the atoms in the
icosohedral isomer are distributed in three main atomic
shells, a surface-like shell and two inner shells; subshells
in the two outermost shells are due to atoms in the vertex
positions. The shell structure is still evident at T=130 K.
The amorphous isomer also exhibits a three-shell struc-
ture at the lowest temperature but with many sub-peaks.
and Tm for
the amorphous isomer, the structure of Na142 is more
ﬂuid. Fig. 3b reveals that the surface of the amorphous
cluster is melted, surface atoms undergoing diﬀusive mo-
tion by interchanging frequently with neighboring sur-
face atoms. The atoms in the outer core-like shell are
somewhat less mobile, as seen in the movies and in the
reduced spread of the < ri(t) >sta curves (compare the
two bold lines), and atom interchanges are less frequent.
The greater ﬂuidity of the cluster is also evident in the
density distribution shown in Fig.5b. At this interme-
diate temperature ρ shows less structure, and although
the grouping of atoms into three shells is still discern-
able, the ﬁne structure is washed by thermal eﬀects. A
slight volume expansion is observed. Turning now to the
icosahedral isomer at T=160 K, Fig. 3a shows less disor-
der than for the amorphous isomer at this temperature
which is below Ts. However, the movies reveal isomer-
ization transitions, similar to those found at the begining
of the melting-like transition of Na8 and Na20.20 These
transitions involve directly the motion of the vacancies
in the outer shell, and through a highly concerted pro-
cess, diﬀerent permutational isomers of the ground state
structure are visited. The onset of this motion is gradual
and would not lead to a signiﬁcant peak in the speciﬁc
heat. Fig. 5a shows that the distinction into three atomic
shells is still clear.

For intermediate temperatures the other two cluster
sizes show a number of diﬀerences for which we oﬀer ex-
planations. Na55 does not show surface melting, or at
least Ts and Tm are so close as to be indistinguishable.
The icosahedral isomer of Na92 shows surface melting
much more removed from Tm than for Na142, and the
amorphous isomer shows no abrupt transition whatso-
ever. Na55 is a perfect two-shell icosahedron, so sur-
face atoms have no empty sites available to move to, and
diﬀusion within an atomic shell is as diﬃcult as diﬀu-
sion across diﬀerent shells. When the surface atoms have
enough energy to exchange positions with another surface
atom they can as easily migrate throughout the whole
cluster, and melting proceeds in a single stage at 190
K. For the icosahedral isomer of Na92, the temperature

4

s

identiﬁed as Tico
is in the range where the isomerization
processes of Na142 set in, but for the smaller cluster these
processes give rise to a distinct peak in the speciﬁc heat.
This happens because of the larger number of vacancies
in the third incomplete shell allowing much easier diﬀu-
sion of the surface atoms which sample a large portion of
conﬁgurational space. The density distribution in solid-
like amorphous Na92 shows that the shell structure is
less pronounced than in amorphous Na142, in particular
the minima between shells are much less deep. It seems
that in Na92 there are no spatially forbidden zones for
the atoms even at low temperature, and the cluster is
more uniformly amorphous than its 142 atom counter-
part. When melting sets in, it involves directly all the
atoms in the cluster, and the melting proceeds gradually
in a broad temperature range.

Fig. 4 shows the time evolution of < ri >sta for Na142
at a temperature T= 361 K for which the cluster is in the
“liquid” regime. Now, all the atoms diﬀuse throughout
the cluster. Some speciﬁc cases of atoms that at the
begining of the simulation are near (far from) the center
of mass of the cluster and end in a position far from (near)
the center of mass of the cluster are shown in boldface.
The density distribution at this temperature shown in
Fig. 5b no longer displays atomic shell structure, and
apart from some minor variations the density is uniform
across the cluster. The expansion of the cluster by about
5 bohr over the low temperature clusters is evident, and
the surface is more diﬀuse. The density is also constant
at 280 K (see ﬁg. 5a), just above the melting point. The
other clusters at the highest temperatures have a similar
uniform density distribution.

Our results for icosahedral isomers suggest that the
melting transition in large clusters occurs in a smaller
temperature range than for small clusters such as Na8 or
Na20.20 Furthermore, the size of any prepeak diminishes
with respect to the main homogenous melting peak as
the cluster size increases, that is as the fraction of atoms
on the surface of the cluster that can take part in pre-
melting decreases. Consequently, a homogeneous melt-
ing temperature can be deﬁned with less ambiguity for
the larger clusters. These comments apply to the caloric
and the speciﬁc heat curves, which are the quantities
amenable to experimental measurement. In contrast, mi-
croscopic quantities such as the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D or
the < ri(t) >sta curves are very sensitive to any small re-
organization in the atomic arrangement, and it is diﬃcult
to determine the melting temperature from the variation
of these quantities with temperature. For example, D in-
creases substantially when the cluster surface melts, but
undergoes just a further small enhancement upon homo-
geneous melting. A good structural, as opposed to a ther-
mal indicator of the melting transition in medium-sized
or large clusters is the shape of the ionic density distri-
bution. The density displays pronounced shell structure
at low temperatures which is smoothed out somewhat at
intermediate temperatures where the vacancy diﬀusion
and/or surface melting mechanisms are present. Above
Tm the density is ﬂat throughout the cluster apart from
some noise due to the relatively short runs, in no case
longer than 20 ps.

In ﬁgure 6 we compare our calculated values of the
melting temperature for several cluster sizes with the
experimental values. Our earlier results for Na8 and
20 are also included, although for such small sizes
Na20
there is ambiguity in deﬁning a melting temperature. For
Na92 and Na142 there is excellent agreement with the ex-
perimental results.6 Recently, measurements have been
reported35,36 of the temperature dependence of the pho-
toabsorption cross sections for Na+
n (n=4–16). Although
the spectra do not show signatures of any sharp melting
transition, which could be due to a broad transition re-
gion, some comparison between theory and experiment
can be made. The spectra do not change appreciably
upon increasing the cluster temperature, until at T=105
K (the value given as the experimental melting temper-
ature of Na8 in Fig. 6), the spectra begin to evolve in a
continuous way. In our study of the melting behaviour
20 we found a broad transition starting at T=110
of Na8
K and continuing to T=220 K at which point the “liq-
uid” state was fully developed. This may explain the
absence of abrupt changes in the photoabsorption spec-
trum with temperature.
In any case, we feel that the
good agreement between theory and experiment extends
to the small sizes. However, our method is not expected
to give accurate results whenever oscillations in the melt-
ing temperature with cluster size arise as a consequence
of electronic shell eﬀects. The discrepancy for Na55 re-
mains intriguing. In this regard it is perhaps noteworthy
that our calculated melting temperatures for the three
large clusters ﬁt precisely the expected large N behaviour,
3 , where C is a constant,
Tm(NaN )=Tm(bulk) + C/N
and yield as a bulk melting temperature Tm(bulk)=350
K, which is close to the observed value of 371 K. A simi-
lar extrapolation to the bulk melting temperature is not
evident in the experimental data.

IV. SUMMARY

The melting-like transitions of Na142, Na92, and
Na55 have been investigated by applying an orbital-free,
density-functional molecular dynamics method. The
computational eﬀort which is required is modest in
comparison with the traditional Car-Parrinello Molecu-
lar Dynamics technique based on Kohn-Sham orbitals.
Speciﬁcally, the computational eﬀort to update the elec-
tronic system scales linearly with the system size N, in
contrast to the N3 scaling of orbital-based methods. This
saving allows the study of large clusters. However, the
cost is an approximate electron kinetic energy.

Melting is found to depend on the starting low-
temperature isomer. An amorphous isomer of Na142
melts in two well-deﬁned steps. The transition at Ts ≈
130 K, from a rigid cluster in which the atoms are vi-
brating around ﬁxed equilibrium positions to a phase
in which the surface atoms become mobile, is best de-
scribed as surface melting. This is followed at Tm ≈ 270
K by homogeneous melting. For the icosahedral Na142
isomer, thermal, macroscopic properties place these two
stages much closer in temperature (240 and 270 K re-
spectively), in better accordance with the experimental

5

one-stage picture. Nevertheless, there is diﬀusive motion
involving surface defects at a temperature as low as 130
K. For Na92, the melting transition of the amorphous iso-
mer is spread over a broad temperature range, and there
are no abrupt signatures in the caloric curve. Again the
melting of the icosahedral isomer gives better agreement
with the one-stage picture. There is a secondary peak
at 130K, which is much smaller than the main peak at
240 K. Na55, being a perfect two-shell icosahedron with
no surface defects melts in a single stage at 190 K. In all
cases, for T>Tm the atoms are able to diﬀuse through-
out the cluster volume. Both the calculated Tm at which
homogeneous melting occurs and the estimated latent
heat of fusion qm are in excellent agreement with the ex-
perimental results of Haberland and coworkers for Na142
20 are
and Na92; our earlier results on the melting of Na8
also consistent with the variation of the measured opti-
cal spectrum with temperature. A serious discrepancy
between theory and experiment remains for Na55.

We have found that structural quantities obtained
from the simulations which are very useful in the study
of melting in small clusters,20 such as the diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcient, are not, in the case of the larger clusters studied
here, eﬃcient indicators of homogeneous melting, which
is easily located with thermal indicators. A better struc-
tural indicator is the evolution with temperature of the
average radial ion density. This quantity becomes con-
stant when homogeneous melting occurs, highlighting the
collective nature of the melting-like transition.

Captions of Figures and Tables.
Figure 1 Speciﬁc heat of Na142 (a), Na92 (b) and Na55
(c) as functions of the internal cluster temperature. The
deviation around the mean temperature is smaller than
the size of the circles.

Figure 2 Short-time averaged distances between each
atom in Na142 and the center of mass, as functions of
time for (a) the icosahedral isomer at T= 30 K and (b)
the amorphous isomer at T= 47 K.

Figure 3 Short-time averaged distances between each
atom in Na142 and the center of mass, as functions of time
for (a) the icosahedral isomer and (b) the amorphous
isomer at T= 160 K. The bold lines follow the evolution of
an atom in the surface shell and another in the outermost
core shell.

Figure 4 Short-time averaged distances between each
atom in Na142 and the center of mass, as functions of
time at T= 361 K. The bold lines are to guide the eye in
following the diﬀusive behavior of speciﬁc atoms.

Figure 5 Averaged radial ionic densities of the icosa-
hedral (a) and amorphous (b) isomers of Na142, each at
some representative temperatures. Notice the evolution
towards an average constant density as the temperature
increases. The same trend is observed for the other two
cluster sizes.

Figure 6 Calculated melting temperatures, compared
with the experimental values of Tm. The experimental
values for the larger cluster sizes are taken from ref. 6,
while that for the smallest Na8 cluster is taken from ref.
35 (see text for details).

Density functional molecular dynamical simulations have been performed on Ga17 and Ga13 clus-
ters to understand the recently observed higher-than-bulk melting temperatures in small gallium
clusters [Breaux et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 215508 (2003)]. The speciﬁc-heat curve, calculated with
the multiple-histogram technique, shows the melting temperature to be well above the bulk melting
point of 303 K, viz. around 650 K and 1400 K for Ga17 and Ga13, respectively. The higher-than-bulk
melting temperatures are attributed mainly to the covalent bonding in these clusters, in contrast
with the covalent-metallic bonding in the bulk.

Probing ﬁnite-temperature properties of clusters is a
challenging task, both experimentally and theoretically.
During the last few years a number of intriguing aspects
of the melting properties of these ﬁnite-sized systems
have been observed, such as a negative microcanonical
speciﬁc heat [1] and substantially higher melting tem-
peratures than the bulk systems [2]. In a series of exper-
iments on free sodium clusters (with sizes ranging from
55 to 357 atoms), Haberland and co-workers [3] observed
a substantial lowering (by about 30%) of melting temper-
atures compared to bulk sodium, with rather large size-
dependent ﬂuctuations in the melting points. Jarrold
and co-workers [2] showed that small tin clusters (with
sizes between 10 and 30 atoms) do not melt at least 50 K
above the bulk melting temperature. Surprisingly, a very
recent measurement on small gallium clusters by Breaux
et al.
[4] presented another example of a higher-than-
bulk melting point. Their measurements indicated that

above the bulk melting point [Tm(bulk) = 303 K]. These
authors also investigated the fragmentation pattern, but
were unable to ﬁnd the existence of any particular stable
building block, and did not oﬀer any explanation for the
high melting points.

Traditionally, classical molecular dynamics (MD) sim-
ulations have been used to understand the ﬁnite-
temperature behavior of clusters [5]. For example, al-
most all simulations carried out to explain the thermo-
dynamic data of sodium clusters are based on classical
MD employing a variety of parametrized interatomic po-
tentials [6]. However, these attempts have fallen short of
reproducing the crucial characteristics observed exper-
imentally, such as the detailed sizes at which maxima
in the melting points occur. Quite clearly, for repro-
ducing the experimental results a more realistic treat-
ment of interacting electrons is desirable. Recently, we

have successfully demonstrated the power of density func-
tional molecular dynamics (DFMD) by providing a de-
tailed explanation of the experimentally observed phe-
nomena of higher-than-bulk melting temperatures for tin
clusters [7]. In particular, we have shown that the cova-
lent bonding along with the existence of a highly stable
tricapped trigonal prism (TTP) subunit is responsible
for the higher melting temperature. For gallium clusters
also, an ab initio treatment is quite crucial for simulating
the ﬁnite-temperature behavior, especially since there is
a possibility of a change in the nature of the bonding.

In this Letter, we provide an explanation and insight
into the phenomenon of the higher-than-bulk melting
temperature recently observed in small gallium clusters
[4]. To this end we have carried out ab initio density
functional simulations over a wide range of tempera-
tures speciﬁcally for the neutral clusters Ga17 and Ga13.
We present the calculated speciﬁc heat obtained via a
multiple-histogram (MH) analysis [10]. We also present
a detailed analysis of bonding in these clusters and con-
trast it with that of bulk. In an earlier density functional
calculation by Jones, the bonds in small Gallium clusters
have been found to be shorter than those between the
lighter atoms in the same main group, i.e. Al [8]. As
we shall see, these clusters indeed melt at a temperature
substantially higher than Tm(bulk), mainly due to the
formation of covalent bonds.

The isokinetic Born-Oppenheimer MD simulations
have been carried out using ultrasoft pseudopotentials
within the local density approximation, as implemented
in the vasp package [9]. For Ga17, the MD calculations
were carried out for 23 temperatures, each of duration
75 ps, in the range of 150 ≤ T ≤ 1100 K, which results
in a total simulation time of 1.65 ns. The resulting tra-
jectory data have been used to compute the ionic speciﬁc
heat by employing the MH method [10, 11]. For all the
calculations, we have used only sp electrons (4s2 and 4p1)

as valence electrons, taking 3d as a part of the ionic core
(represented by an ultrasoft pseudopotential). We have
veriﬁed that the d electrons do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the
ﬁnite temperature behavior and equilibrium geometries
by recalculating the equilibrium structures, and perform-
ing three runs at ﬁnite temperature around the melting
region, with the d electrons treated explicitly as valence
electrons.

We begin our discussion by noting some interesting
features of the electronic structure of bulk Ga, which has
[12]. The α-Ga lat-
been investigated by Gong et al.
tice, which is stable at ambient pressure, can be viewed
as base-centered orthorhombic with eight atoms in the
unit cell. The peculiarity of this structure is that each
atom has only one nearest neighbor connected by a short
bond at a distance of 2.44 ˚A (see Fig. 1). The six other
neighbors are at distances of 2.71 and 2.79 ˚A, in two
sets of three. These six atoms lie on strongly buckled
parallel planes connected by the short bonds, as shown
in Fig. 1. Electronic structure calculations by Gong et
al. [12] reveal this short bond to be covalent in nature.
The density of states shows a pseudogap, which has been
related to this covalent bond [13], and the weak bonding
in the buckled planes leads to an observed metallic be-
havior. Thus, two kinds of bonds coexist in bulk Ga: one
a molecular bond between the nearest neighbors, and the
other a metallic bond within the buckled planes.

Now we present and discuss some relevant features ob-
served in the equilibrium structures of Ga17. We have
relaxed many structures, randomly chosen from high-
temperature DFMD runs.
In this way, we have found
more than 20 diﬀerent equilibrium structures spanning
an energy range of about 0.83 eV with respect to the
ground-state energy. In Fig. 2, we show some low-lying
structures relevant to the present discussion. A com-
mon feature observed in all these geometries, except one
(Fig. 2-d), is the presence of a trapped atom, that is,
a single atom contained within a cage formed by the
remaining atoms. The lowest-energy structure that we
have found (Fig. 2-a) is a highly asymmetric structure,
which can be thought of as formed out of a decahedron

with serious distortions and asymmetric capping. Inter-
estingly, these structures can also be viewed as composed
of two near planar rings, joined to each other by bonds
formed between the atoms at the edge of each ring and
with the trapped atom at the center. Henceforth, we
shall refer to these edge atoms and the trapped atom as
bridge atoms. An analysis of the bond lengths reveals
that each atom in the cluster has at least two nearest
neighbors at a distance of 2.5 ˚A or less. The signiﬁcance
of these features will become clear when we present the
bonding analysis.

We have analyzed the nature of bonding by employ-
ing the electron localization function (ELF) [14], which
is deﬁned such that values approaching unity indicate a
strong localization of the valence electrons and covalent
bonding. The isosurface of the ELF at a value 0.68, and
the corresponding isosurface of total valence charge den-
sity at a value of 60% of the maximum, are shown in
Figs. 3-a and 3-b, respectively. A striking feature seen in
these ﬁgures is the existence of strong localized bonds giv-
ing rise to two ring-like structures. Further, these rings
are also bonded to each other via the bridge atoms men-
tioned above. The existence of an isosurface of the ELF
(Fig. 3-a) with such a high value clearly indicates the
covalent nature of the bonding. This is also substanti-
ated by the charge-density isosurface (Fig. 3-b), where
localized charge density is clearly seen along the rings as
well as across them. The bonding seen here is in sharp
contrast to the one observed in the bulk α-Ga, where,
as discussed earlier, only a single strong interlayer bond
between two Ga atoms exists (see Fig. 1). It may be re-
called from our earlier discussion that in this cluster each
atom has two nearest neighbors, which enables the ring
formation. Indeed, it is the existence of these intercon-
nected rings which is responsible for the higher melting
temperature.

An examination of the molecular orbitals and the
eigenvalue spectrum (not shown) brings out some notable
features. The eigenvalue spectrum is divided into two
groups, which are separated by about 1.18 eV. The lower
15 states forming the ﬁrst group are the bonding states
formed out of atomic 4s orbitals. Almost all the upper
states are formed out of pure atomic p orbitals and show
no sp hybridization. The only exception to this is the
bonding between the trapped atom and its three nearest
neighbors, where a weak sp2 hybridization is observed.
This picture is also conﬁrmed by a site-projected spher-
ical harmonics analysis of the orbitals, which does not
show any signiﬁcant mixing of s and p character in these
states. All the bonds seen are of predominantly σ type,
formed out of atomic s and p orbitals.

The calculated speciﬁc heat curve for Ga17 is shown in
Fig. 4. A clear peak is observed in the speciﬁc heat with
a maximum around 650 K, well above the bulk melting
point of 303 K. Following the discussion in Ref. [7], we
expect the statistical uncertainty in our peak position
to be up to 15%. Now, a novel multicollision induced
dissociation scheme has recently been used to measure
the caloric curve of small, charged Ga clusters [4]. For

+, no evidence was found for melting (in the sense of
Ga17
a peak in the speciﬁc heat) over a temperature range 90–
720 K. Our simulations are consistent with this ﬁnding.
Note that there is likely to be some shift of the melting
point between the neutral and charged cluster.

Our speciﬁc-heat curve shows no premelting features
in the temperature range studied, and that the peak
is quite broad, as expected for the ﬁnite-sized systems.
A detailed examination of the ionic motion at diﬀerent
temperatures sheds more light on the nature of melting.
Around 225 K, we observe the occurrence of the ﬁrst
excited state (Fig. 2-b). As the temperature rises fur-
ther, the system visits a variety of isomers all of which
contain a trapped atom.
It is only above 550 K that
the isomer shown in Fig. 2-d is observed. Evidently,
the peak in the speciﬁc heat is associated with the diﬀu-
sion of the trapped atom out of the enclosing structure.
Interestingly, in the trajectories at all temperatures be-
low 600 K, the trapped atom is seen to bond itself to

4

Therefore, it is not unreasonable to expect this cluster to
melt at a somewhat lower temperature than Ga17, but
still higher than that of the bulk.

In conclusion, we have carried out extensive density
functional thermodynamical simulations on Ga17 and
Ga13 with the aim of understanding the observed higher-
than-bulk melting temperatures. The analysis of the
speciﬁc-heat curve clearly indicates the melting temper-
atures (deﬁned as the peak of the speciﬁc heat curve)
to be around 650 K and 1400 K for Ga17 and Ga13, re-
spectively. This result is consistent with the recent ex-
perimental observations of Breaux et al. [4]. We ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant change in the nature of bonding between bulk
Ga and small Ga clusters. The strong covalent bonds
in the small clusters, along with the stabilizing role of
the trapped atom in Ga17, are responsible for the higher-
than-bulk melting temperatures.

atoms in both rings. This confers stability on the caged
structure. We have also carried out the analysis of the
melting properties via traditional parameters such as the
root-mean-square bond-length ﬂuctuations and the mean
square atomic displacements (not shown). Their behav-
ior is consistent with the above observations.

To summarize, our ab initio MD simulations have
shown that the elevated melting temperature of Ga17 is
due mainly to the formation of a ring of covalent bonds.
The stability of the cluster is further enhanced by the
role of the caged atom. These observations should have
implications for the melting characteristics of clusters of
smaller sizes, especially Ga13. The ground state geome-
try of Ga13 is decahedral, a more compact structure hav-
ing a greater number of bonds per atom than Ga17. It
is well known that the 13-atom cluster has an enhanced
stability due to the geometry. Further, our bonding anal-
ysis shows that the bonding is strongly covalent, similar
to Ga17. We therefore expect this cluster to melt at a
higher temperature than Ga17. To verify this conjecture,
we have carried out extensive DFMD simulations for 30
diﬀerent temperatures in the range 40 ≤ T ≤ 1750 K,
with a total simulation time of about 2.7 ns. The result-
ing speciﬁc heat is shown in Fig. 4. Indeed, the peak is
around 1400 K, a much higher value than the peak po-
sition of Ga17 or the bulk melting point. The detailed
analysis will be published elsewhere.

clusters prevents us from making a complete thermody-
namic study at this stage. However, we have found and

face, and not all the atoms on the surface are bonded.

Abstract

To learn about basic aspects of nano-scale spherical molecular shells
during their formation, spherically curved two-dimensional N -particle
Lennard-Jones systems are simulated, studying curvature evolution paths
at zero-temperature. For many N -values (N < 800) equilibrium conﬁgu-
rations are traced as a function of the curvature radius R. Sharp jumps
for tiny changes in R between trajectories with major diﬀerences in topo-
logical structure correspond to avalanche-like transitions. For a typical
case, N = 25, equilibrium conﬁgurations fall on smooth trajectories in
state space which can be traced in the E − R plane. The trajectories
show-up with local energy minima, from which growth in N at steady
curvature can develop.

Introduction

In vitro self-organization in aqueous solution of nanoscale spherical shells,
like various types of nano-vesicles [1, 2, 3, 4]) and viral capsids [5] is a ther-
modynamic process driven by overall free energy minimization. The result-
ing shell has inherent tendencies toward a) crystalline structure [6, 7, 8], b)
global polyhedral symmetry [9, 10, 11], and c) discrete sizes [1, 12, 13], thus
discrete curvatures.

A compelling question is whether during thermodynamic growth a tran-
sient uncompleted (open) shell of given N prefers intrinsically to adopt a
speciﬁc equilibrium radius of curvature (R), and whether this radius - on

the basis of molecular packing order already - may be approximately stable
during (part of) that growth. The occurrence of local minima in the mean
(per particle) potential energy (E) of an emerging shell as a function of all
internal degrees of freedom - including R - along the evolution path in state
space, could thus be signiﬁcant for steady curvature during growth in N .

In this paper we approach the problem in a much simpliﬁed model that
allows systematic generic studies. The sphericity of the shell, in reality due
to intrinsic 3D-properties of the optimally closely packed molecular subunits,
is built-in as a global geometrical constraint. We perform computer experi-
ments with freely relaxing - possibly open - spherically curved zero-thickness
monolayers of identical molecules, studying structural properties in relation
with N and R. Our approach is most natural for monolayer nanowheel vesi-
cles [4], but it is as well relevant for tiny bilayer vesicles, where the laterally
most densely packed pseudo-crystalline inner lipid headgroup-sublayer can
act as monolayer ‘backbone’.

− 2r−6

As model we use two-dimensional (2D) Lennard-Jones (LJ) N -particle
systems on a spherical surface with ﬂexible radius at zero temperature [6,
14]. The LJ potential Vij = r−12f f
ij between two particles i and j
with Euclidean distance rij energetically favors close regular packing with
essentially unit distance between neighboring particles [6]. The LJ-form in
the constrained system acts as an eﬀective interaction mimicking the real
complex of interactions. It allows a comprehensive systematic exploration
while keeping salient features of real systems. The present work arises from
a series of computational studies [6] on 2D spherical crystallization in LJ-
systems over a broad range of N , involving thermodynamic behavior and
zero-temperature global energy minimization. The LJ-systems follow local-
equilibrium paths in state space, realistically allowing for local minimum
’hang-ups’ in evolving conﬁgurations.

When many LJ particles are randomly spread over a ﬂat surface they ag-
gregate into an approximately homogeneous conﬁguration, a major fraction
of the particles being trapped inside the bulk (interior). Edge particles have
higher energy than bulk particles, giving rise to edge tension, the 2D equiv-
alent of surface tension. Minimizing edge energy, ﬂat aggregates become
approximately circular patches. Minimizing the overall potential energy the
bulk becomes an essentially regular hexagonal lattice. Allowing for spherical
curvature, the 2D system can further decrease the energy by reducing the
edge length and by a rising attraction from LJ-tails of remote particles (the
LJ-forces acting in 3D). The energy gain by curvature, however, balances
against increasing strain energy of the bulk because of less favorable packing.
Our question becomes whether – thanks to the interplay of these R-
dependent non-linear eﬀects – equilibrium radii Req can be found where
relaxation after any small change in curvature raises E, and freely variable
R leads the system back to the same equilibrium radius. If such local energy

2

minima in open conﬁgurations are thermodynamically signiﬁcant, they can
stabilize transient states along a path of growing N . This is supported
by a LJ-study [15], showing that closed global minimum energy N -particle
conﬁgurations (covering the whole sphere) strongly correlate with speciﬁc
open local minimum conﬁgurations of lower N .

2 Methods

In our experiments, each time the radius R is changed by a small step, the
particle system is relaxed by minimizing – at the new R value – the mean
energy, which implies reaching the nearest equilibrium conﬁguration. The
system is thus evolved in curvature while staying in equilibrium with chang-
ing R. For relaxation (equilibration of forces and energy minimization),
a steepest descent (SD) algorithm [16] is applied while for aggregation a
Metropolis Monte Carlo simulated annealing (SA) [17] optimization is used.
The latter method enhances the probability that the system ends up in a
global energy minimum (GEM) [18] rather than in a local secondary energy
minimum. The 2D-topology of a conﬁguration is deﬁned by the Voronoi
nearest neighbors method [19], giving each particle a coordination number
(CN ), which is 6 everywhere for a ﬂat (hexagonal) GEM conﬁguration. The
value CN −6 is denoted as the disclination charge - short d-charge - of a par-
ticle. In a 2D topological structure any single built-in defect – disclination
or dislocation (tightly bound pair of disclinations with opposite d-charge)
– can be displaced but not removed, except by its annihilation as part of
a set of converging complementary defects, or by moving it all the way to
the edge. During the transformation of a ﬂat GEM lattice to a closed shell
a net total d-charge of -12 must be incorporated in the full Voronoi lattice.
In addition, dislocations have the function of lowering the strain energy in
total, by distributing it locally more evenly [6].

How much the conﬁgurations change during relaxation after a step ∆R,
can be expressed as the mean Euclidean distance, ˆr, traveled between the
associated sets of coordinates xR and xR+∆R in conﬁguration space (mean
taken per particle and per percent change in curvature):
ˆr = |∆R|

i=1(xR,i − xR+∆R,i)2.

3 Computer experiments

From ﬂat to spherical

In a ﬁrst series of experiment we explore gross changes in topological
and geometrical structure and the corresponding energy with monotonously
decreasing R. For hundreds of runs with N < 800 an initial, circularlike
aggregate is prepared from a ﬂat regular hexagonal lattice with unit spacing

3

(GEM for inﬁnite N in ﬂat 2D). In the experiments R is decreased in 1%
steps, each time the conﬁguration being projected onto the new sphere and
then relaxed using the SD method. The decrease in R is continued until
the system is compressed considerably. A system of particular N follows a
‘standard’ (for that N ) evolution path through state space and through the
E − R-plane.

Example, N = 25

Secondly, curved lattices unbiased by any initial conﬁguration and path
history, are simulated while starting in SA mode at high temperature (T =
10) in a random conﬁguration and then aggregate by cooling down the sys-
tem in 5 % ∆T /T steps. SD is applied as ﬁnal tuning. This study is done
for a typical ‘unmagic’ N value, N = 25. In 1300 runs radii are randomly
chosen between R = 1.3 and R = 2.

The equilibrium points in E − R space align over a range of R-values
along distinct smooth trajectories: lines which correspond to continuous sets
of topologically and geometrically closely similar equilibrium conﬁgurations.

Tracing up and down in curvature

The central question of the current paper, whether trajectories of the
system lining-up closely related conﬁgurations, can provide a stable system
against freely variable R, is addressed in a third type of experiment. Starting
from particular open N = 25 conﬁgurations obtained in the second exper-
iment, trajectories are traced (with relaxation) step-by-step in R in both
directions, and the structure is investigated.

4 Results and discussion

Energy trends

In the ﬁrst study a general energy trend is found for all N -values, as
illustrated by three typical examples:
for N =6, 50 and 350 in Fig. 1 (left
column). As expected, the most prominent feature is a deep global mini-
mum along the followed E − R path. Having started from a ﬂat regular
conﬁguration while systematically decreasing R, the particles cover in close
packing an increasing part of the sphere until at the closure radius Rc the
lowest E along the E - R path is reached. At this stage any uncovered area
– and thus any edge – has disappeared. We note that except for details, the
structure is not biased signiﬁcantly by the initial conﬁguration.

The energy diﬀerence, ∆Ec, between the R → ∞ asymptotic value and
the deep minimum represents the energy gain of closure. Additional struc-
secondary, local, minima and sharp downward jumps at
ture is visible:
R > Rc.

Toward smaller radii, R < Rc, the system comes under external pres-
sure, and the density increases. The LJ repulsive core between neighboring

particles then increasingly dominates the energy, the energy rises steeply,
independent of the detailed conﬁguration.

The energy of a conﬁguration can be approximated as E = (Nbulkǫbulk +
Nedgeǫedge)/N , where Nbulk + Nedge = N , ǫbulk = −3.382 being the lowest
possible value corresponding to an inﬁnite ﬂat regular hexagonal lattice while
ǫedge is typically half that value. Due to the impossibility of fully regular
hexagonal packing ǫbulk is higher on a curved surface. The unfavorable
edge energy forms the main driving force for curvature and shell closure,
although - due to topological rearrangement - normally a barrier between
ﬂat and curved states stands in the way. Consequently, for the larger N -
values, starting from the ﬂat GEM conﬁguration, indeed dE/dR is negative,
meaning that at suﬃciently low T such a ﬂat LJ-system is locally stable
against curvature. An exception is the extreme case, N = 6, where the
initially ﬂat LJ-system can immediately gain energy by curving. A tiny
jump in E (at R ≈ 1.36) goes with a discontinuity in the dE/dR slope.
Here already we observe a secondary minimum along the standard E − R
path. For N = 50 below R = 4, local energy minima and jumps are visible.

At Rc ≈ 1.87 the system closes over the sphere. For N = 350 below R = 13,
many minima and many jumps show-up. At Rc ≈ 5 the system closes. In
the second experiment (N = 25), in Fig. 2a, the independently obtained E-
values for ﬁxed, randomly chosen, R-values align along smooth lines in the
E − R plane.

Euclidean distance

Energy jumps (Fig.1 at left) go with structural transitions visible as
spikes in the mean Euclidean distance per particle per percent, ˆr(R) (Fig.1
at right). At R < Rc, the particles hardly move anymore over the sphere,
all ﬂexibility being lost due to the external pressure counterbalanced by the
repulsive core. The smooth background in ˆr(R) reﬂects small adjustments
of an essentially stable conﬁguration after a curvature step. It can be fully
suppressed by reducing the step size, which turns out to leave the transitions
essentially unaﬀected; the sharpness of the transitions remains within a step
size of even an order of magnitude smaller than applied in the current data.

Closure radius

The radius Rc at which the system closes can be predicted by requiring
the packing density on the spherical surface to be (almost) the same as for
6 ). For N =6, 25, 50 and 350 it follows that
a ﬂat lattice, Rc(N ) = q
Rc(N )=0.64, 1.3, 1.9 en 4.9 respectively. These values agree with the data
(Fig. 1 left) except for small N where the packing is far less optimal than
for a ﬂat GEM lattice.

Structural transitions and topological defects

Energy jumps between diﬀerent trajectories involve a major global rear-

rangement.

With successively applied small steps in curvature followed by relaxation,
the system usually undergoes only minor local redistributions, while strain
accumulates in parts of the lattice. At some curvature steps, however, an
avalanche of sequential displacements over a major part of the system is
triggered by local instabilities, while releasing much of the built-up strain. A
small change in R may thus enforce a structural transition to a conﬁguration,
in which both the strain and the 2D-topological (defect) structure have been
drastically altered. An extensive systematic study of the topological defect
structure as a function of N up to 200 is available [6].

The transitions come along with incorporation or removal of defects as
a function of curvature. Energy barriers are present between conﬁgurations
with diﬀerent topological structure. The transition to take place requires
the system to climb the barrier to a threshold for starting an avalanche of
particle moves. The threshold R-value depends on the barrier side, causing
hysteresis.

Starting from an essentially circular patch with ﬂat regular packing, the
‘unstable’ radius Ru where - with increasing curvature - the ﬁrst structural
transition occurs, is modeled as S ∗ 2nmax arcsin(α) = sin(2nmax arcsin(α))
[6], where α = 1/(2Ru), nmax is essentially the largest completed hexagonal
ring, and where S can be taken from the data for a single speciﬁc N -value
(see Table 1).

Open conﬁgurations

The points in Fig. 2a at large R cover a broad range in energy, corre-
sponding to a great variety of open conﬁgurations and edge-arrangements.
As R decreases, the edge becomes smaller, and the variation decreases. Any
ﬂexibility essentially disappears below Rc, due to the strong constraints for
a closed spherical conﬁguration.

Secondary minima

Fig. 2b shows E −R trajectories from the third experiment, starting from
a speciﬁc conﬁguration (near the minimum at R ≈ 1.5) from the second
experiment. Here the system is traced up-and-down in R.
Indeed, the
trajectories in the E − R plane connect unbiased solutions, and – like in
the ﬁrst experiment – jumps and secondary minima occur. The secondary

minima visible in Fig.2c, are obtained starting from conﬁgurations of the
second experiment (Fig.2c), and tracing in R up and down until a jump
occurs. The minima have a typical depth of 10% of the closure energy ∆Ec.
At non-zero T the thermodynamic signiﬁcance of such minima should be
judged with respect to both kT and ∆Ec.

Variable N

The ﬁnding of distinct locally-stable open conﬁgurations for ﬁxed N
raises the expectation that any discrete curvature may remain, or change
smoothly, during growth when particles are added. A study of this type [15]
indeed indicates that discrete locally-stable conﬁguration trajectories exist
as a function of both R and N , where the bulk packing remains essentially
the same.

In conclusion, for ﬁxed-N two-dimensional spherical Lennard-Jones sys-
tems at zero temperature, the global energy minimum with decreasing cur-
vature radius R is approached through sharp transitions with major rear-
rangements. These transitions bring-in topological defects connected with
curvature. The curvature range of events relevant for self-assembly, Ru - Rc
is consistent with simple models. Apart from the closed (global) minimum
energy conﬁguration, secondary, local, minima show up at larger R-values,
with an open conﬁguration. This phenomena – here shown for N = 25
– occurs naturally as a consequence of optimal packing topologies. Dur-
ing growth toward a complete shell such minima can capture ‘threads’ of
steady curvature along with growth in N , while staying in equilibrium. The
present results and methods can help guide further generic studies of the
self-organization in complex spherical molecular systems.

Melting and evaporation transitions in small Al clusters:
canonical Monte-Carlo simulations

Abstract. A dimer of bound atoms cannot melt, only dissociate. Bulk metals show a well deﬁned ﬁrst order
transition between their solid and liquid phases. The appearance of the melting transition is explored for
increasing clusters sizes via the signatures in the speciﬁc heat and the root mean square of the bond
lengths δB (Berry parameter) by means of Monte-Carlo simulations of Al clusters modelled by Gupta
potentials. Clear signatures of a melting transition appear for N ∼ 6 atoms. Closed-shell eﬀects are
shown for clusters with up to 56 atoms. The melting transition is compared in detail with the dissociation
transition, which induces a second and possibly much larger local maximum in the speciﬁc heat at higher
temperatures. Larger clusters are shown to fragment into dimers and trimers, which in turn dissociate at
higher temperatures.

1 Introduction

The properties of small metal clusters have enjoyed a large
interest over the past years. Their technical application
in catalysis stems from the large surface-to-volume ratio
while their properties diﬀer from those of the bulk mate-
rial raising the fundamental question about the statistical
mechanics of ﬁnite systems.

The melting process of small clusters has early on been
identiﬁed as the onset of isomer ﬂuctuations [1,2]. More
recent investigations on Ni13−xAlx alloy clusters in the mi-
crocanonical ensemble [3] show the relation between iso-
mer ﬂuctuations and the increase in entropy across the
melting transition. The onset of the melting transition
is marked by the ﬂuctuations into the lowest energy iso-
mer conﬁgurations which are measured by the root mean
square bond length ﬂuctuations [4] sometimes referred to
as the Berry parameter [5]. The phase space occupied by
those ﬂuctuations is small for small clusters resulting in
a maximum in the speciﬁc heat at somewhat higher tem-
peratures. The maximum in the speciﬁc heat in turn is
determined by the onset of isomer ﬂuctuations occupy-
ing a suﬃciently large phase space fraction. A detailed
overview of the increase of phase space with increasing
particle number and the classiﬁcation of isomers in terms
of potential energy surfaces is given in Ref. [6]. Molecular
Dynamics (MD) investigations [7] of the melting transi-
tion of larger AuN clusters with 100 < N < 1000 show
that the bulk limit is gradually attained in agreement with
experimental [8] ﬁndings.

Recently the empirical investigation of the melting of
small Sn [9] and Ga [10] clusters has revealed a possible
stability of the solid phase of the particles beyond the
melting temperature of the bulk material. This result was
interpreted as a consequence of the speciﬁc rigid ground
state structure of the clusters and found support in micro-
canonical MD calculations for C, Si, Ge, and Sn clusters
[11] as well as for isokinetic MD investigations of Sn10
particles [12].

In metals the contribution from the conduction elec-
trons to the binding energy has to be modelled by many-
body potentials [13,14], which are numerically more in-
volved than the thoroughly investigated Lennard-Jones
systems [6,15,16]. A prominent example is the Gupta po-
tential (GP) [13], which can be derived in the second mo-
ment approximation from a tight binding model [17] and
which correctly describes the surface contraction observed
in metals:

Ralph Werner: Melting and evaporation transitions in small Al clusters: canonical Monte-Carlo simulations

The present paper aims to shed light on how the melt-
ing transition evolves in the limit of small clusters. The
method is a MC simulation in the canonical ensemble. A
standard Metropolis algorithm is employed [19,20] with
an update after each random displacement of an atom
within an interval [0, dmax] in all spatial dimensions. dmax
is set to yield an MC acceptance rate of 50 to 60 %. The
√T .
resulting temperature dependence is roughly dmax
The boundary conditions are imposed by a hard wall cube
with linear dimension L. Runs are performed with sam-
107 steps per temperature
pling rates (SR) of up to 8
×
and atom. The ﬂuctuations on the curves shown in the
paper are a measure of the statistical error and appear
near phase transition because of the usual critical slow-
ing down. The ground state energies and conﬁgurations
obtained within this method are in good agreement with
earlier results [3,21]. The ground state conﬁgurations of
the clusters discussed herein have the same symmetries as
those of the 9-6 Sutton-Chen potentials [22].

where the brackets denote the thermodynamic average in
the canonical ensemble. The parameter Eq. (2) measures
the root mean square of the distance between two atoms
averaged over all pairs. Even short isomer ﬂuctuations
with a subsequent return to the ground state can leave
the cluster reordered, i.e., a previously nearest neighbour
pair rij may become a second- or third-neighbour pair af-
ter the ﬂuctuation. Such a reordering leads to a notable
increase in δB allowing for the clear identiﬁcation of a
melting transition. Note that the Lindemann criterion of
melting, which measures the atomic ﬂuctuations with re-
spect to their equilibrium positions, is usually employed
for bulk systems but is less well suited for cluster systems
[5].

The second observable of interest is the speciﬁc heat,
which can be obtained from the thermodynamic averages

Since the atoms are treated as classical particles the con-

In order to obtain a more intuitive understanding of
the melting process a real-time visualisation of the sim-
ulation has been implemented. Figure 1 illustrates snap-
shots of an Al13 cluster in a volume of (6r0)3 at temper-
atures (a) T = 0, (b) kBT = 0.1 eV, and (c) kBT = 0.4

ter, respectively. The graphs show the corresponding nor-
malised pair distribution functions g(r) (arbitrary units).
The ground state is icosahedral which is diﬀerent but close
to the slightly distorted icosahedral conﬁguration obtained
by ﬁrst principle calculations [23]. Contacts of the clusters

2 Appearance of the melting transition

A dimer of bound atoms cannot melt, only dissociate. Bulk
metals show a well deﬁned ﬁrst order transition between
their solid and liquid phases. This phase transition is ac-
companied by a divergence in the temperature dependence
of the speciﬁc heat indicating the increase in entropy and
the associated latent heat as well as by a discontinuous
jump in the Berry parameter Eq. (2). Figure 2 shows how
both signatures evolve [speciﬁc heat (a) and Berry param-
eter (b)] as the particle number is increased from 2 to 10
atoms.

Al5 is the smallest cluster with inequivalent bonds in
its ground state conﬁguration resulting in the abrupt in-
crease in δB once isomer ﬂuctuations set in at around
kBT
6 the
increase in entropy is suﬃciently large around a speciﬁc
temperature to lead to a local maximum in the speciﬁc
heat. As observed previously [3], the isomer ﬂuctuations
leading to the jump in δB occur at lower temperatures
than the maximum in the speciﬁc heat. The temperature
of the discontinuity in δB depends on the energy barrier
between the ground state conﬁguration and the lowest en-
ergy isomers [6].

≥

Note that the presence of well deﬁned signatures of
the melting transition in the speciﬁc heat for clusters with
N < 10 is somewhat unexpected since the experimentally
investigated NaN clusters [24] appear to show no feature
in the caloric curves for N < 100 and for Lennard-Jones
clusters [16] the corresponding signature disappears for
N < 30.

It is remarkable that the absence of signatures of a well
deﬁned melting transition does not imply that the clus-
ters remain solid up to higher temperatures. For example,
the real time visualisation of an Al4 particle (within the
MC/GP approach, see Fig. 1 for an illustration) at T = 0.1

1160 K reveals that the cluster ﬂuctuates out of
its tetrahedral ground state into almost planar conﬁgura-
tions and certainly cannot be considered solid. The small
size of the phase space is responsible for the absence of
a signature of the melting in the speciﬁc heat while the
equivalence of all bonds in the ground state conﬁguration
result in a featureless δB.

The critical value of the Berry parameter at the melt-

0.05,
which is referred to as the modiﬁed Lindemann criterion.
These numbers are consistent with the present observation
5, where at the melting transition
for clusters with N
a jump occurs from values of δB
0.05 to values
of δB > 1.5 [1,2,3,20,25]. For smaller clusters with N = 3
and 4 the temperature dependence of the Berry parameter
is featureless. For N = 4 at T = 0.1 eV/kB and for N = 3

the Lindemann criterion [5].

3 Closed-shell eﬀects

The inﬂuence of closed shells on the cohesive energies of
metal clusters [22,23,21,6] and their melting points [8,
25,20] has been a focus of research for quite some time.
A closed-shell cluster has a large gap to the ﬁrst excited
isomer while adding or removing an atom leads to a num-
ber of degenerate ground state conﬁgurations separated
by a potential barrier. This manifests itself in a smoother
speciﬁc heat anomaly as well as in a jump in the Berry pa-
rameter at much lower temperatures as compared to the
closed-shell counterpart. This is shown in Fig. 3(a) and
(c) for the sets of N = 12, 13, 14 and in Fig. 3(b) and (d)
for the sets of N = 54, 55, 56 atoms. The upper panels (a)
and (b) show the speciﬁc heat, the lower panels (c) and
(d) the Berry parameter.

Notably the 14 and 56 atom clusters have a very low
barrier between isomers. The real time visualisation re-
veals that these ﬂuctuations occur in Al14 not only by
jumps of the 14th atom on the surface of the Al13 icosa-
hedron but by absorption of the 14th atom into the outer
shell and simultaneous pushing of another atom onto the
surface. In Al56 the 56th atom is absorbed into the outer

4

shell even in the ground state conﬁguration (see Sutton-
Chen 9-6 in Ref. [22]). This leads to the large jump in δB at
very low temperatures [dash-dotted lines in Fig. 3(c) and
(d)]. In Al14 the phase space is suﬃciently large to induce
an anomaly in the speciﬁc heat [dash-dotted line in Fig.
3(a)] at the same temperature. Together with the main
maximum at higher temperatures this may be referred to
as a two-step melting mechanism [25,26,27].

The narrower speciﬁc heat anomaly at the melting
transition and the smaller discrepancy between the maxi-
mum of the speciﬁc heat and the jump in the Berry param-
eter for the larger systems in Fig. 3(b) and (d) illustrate
how the thermodynamic limit is gradually approached as
the cluster size is increased [7,25,28]. Note that for larger
clusters less sampling steps per temperature and atom are
required to obtain smooth curves. The larger phase space
of the larger clusters [6] results in the better convergence
of the observables.

The canonical ensemble as shown for Al13 in Fig. 3(a)
and (b) yields a somewhat lower speciﬁc heat [25] and
an onset of the isomer ﬂuctuations at lower temperatures
as compared with the results for the microcanonical en-
semble in Ref. [3]. The discrepancies can be attributed to
the energy ﬂuctuations in the canonical ensemble that al-
low the potential barriers between diﬀerent isomers to be
overcome at lower temperatures.

4 Ideal gas limit

The well deﬁned high temperature limit, where the system
has the properties of an ideal gas, yields a test of the
numerical methods and is essential for determining the
latent heat of the evaporation transition in Sec. 5. Figure
4 illustrates the large T behaviour of the speciﬁc heat
(full line, right scale) and the Berry parameter (broken
line, left scale) for Al2 (a), Al7 (b), and Al13 (c). Since the
Boltzmann weight can be expanded as exp
=
V /(kBT ) + O(T −2), the speciﬁc heat attains the limit
1
as C = 3
2 kB + a T −3 + O(T −4) while the Berry parameter
is δB = δ∞ + b T −1 + O(T −2) with δ∞ = 0.3768(1). Here a
and b are volume and particle number speciﬁc constants.
An analytical scaling analysis reveals that δ∞ depends on
the container geometry but neither on its volume nor the
particle number.

5 Dissociation

Between the low temperature liquid phase and the high
temperature ideal gas limit Fig. 4 shows clear maxima
both in the speciﬁc heat and the Berry parameter for Al2,
Al7, as well as for Al13. The feature is generic for all cluster
sizes and can be associated with the dissociation transi-
tion. The dissociation anomaly in the speciﬁc heat stems
from the increase in entropy across the dissociation tran-
sition while the Berry parameter is enhanced through the
short-time elongation and return of an atom from and to
the cluster. The latter involves an energy ﬂuctuation and

is consequently suppressed in a microcanonical or isoki-
netic ensemble.

Figure 5 shows the container size dependence of the
dissociation transition of an Al13 cluster for volumes of
L3 = (4r0)3, (6r0)3, (10r0)3, (15r0)3, and (20r0)3. For
L3 = (4r0)3 the density N/L3 = 0.0144 mole/cm3 is only
a factor 7 smaller than that of bulk Al with 0.1 mole/cm3.
This leads essentially to a suppression of the evapora-
tion transition, which is replaced by a smooth crossover
(see also Fig. 6). Note that even macroscopic particles
do not exhibit a sharp evaporation transition in a ﬁnite,
constant volume imposing a ﬁnite, temperature depen-
dent gas-phase partial pressure. As a consequence there
is a liquid-vapour coexistence region which is given by the
width of the speciﬁc heat anomalies shown in Fig. 5. The
snapshot shown in Fig. 7(b) in Sec. 6 is taken in the liquid-
vapour coexistence region of Al13 for L3 = (20r0)3, where
liquid fragments of the cluster coexist with evaporated
single atoms.

Both the anomaly in the speciﬁc heat (upper panel in
Fig. 5) and the Berry parameter (lower panel in Fig. 5) in-
crease with increasing volume and become narrower. In an
inﬁnite volume the partial pressure of the gas phase is zero
and both quantities are expected to exhibit a sharp peak
at the transition. Note that the ﬂuctuations of the graphs
in Fig. 5 increase with increasing volume as a consequence
of the enlarged phase space and thus limit the simulations
to small volumes. The melting transition is independent
of the container volume. This is expected since the pres-
sure in the system is essentially zero when all atoms are
condensed [29].

For suﬃciently small densities or, equivalently, large
volumes the latent heat of the melting transition is much
smaller than the energy released in the evaporation transi-
tion [29]. For Al13 this becomes apparent from the caloric
curves of the total enclosed system shown in Fig. 6, which
are obtained by simply integrating the speciﬁc heat (Fig. 5)
EB. The
for a ﬁxed volume, i.e., EV (T ) =
binding energy per atom for N = 13 is EB = 2.60088 eV.
Since the transitions are smeared out the determination of
the latent heat is somewhat ambiguous. Extrapolation of
the linear segments of the caloric curves above and below
the melting transition (dashed lines in Fig. 6) and reading
oﬀ the energy diﬀerence at the temperature of the speciﬁc
heat maximum yields ∆Emelt

For L/r0 = 4 the ideal gas limit is reached only for tem-
peratures much larger than the binding energy per atom,
i.e., kBT

153, 203. The inset shows the determination of the latent heat
∆Emelt ≈ 0.08 eV of the melting transition. The dash-dotted
line is the ideal gas case reached only for temperatures much
larger than the binding energy, i.e., kBT ≫ 2.60088 eV.

From the above discussion follows that the dissociation
anomalies in the speciﬁc heat usually dominate in size over
those of the melting transition especially for clusters that
do not have closed-shell structures. An example is Al7 as
shown in the middle panel of Fig. 4. The jump in δB is yet
well pronounced conﬁrming its sensitivity to the melting
transition [5].

6 Fragmentation

On closer examination the curves of the speciﬁc heat of
Al13 for suﬃciently large volumes show another broad lo-
cal maximum at higher temperatures. For L/r0 = 20 as
shown in Fig. 5(a) this maximum is found near kBT
0.36
eV. This eﬀect is readily explained by the fragmenta-
tion of the cluster into dimers and trimers at tempera-
tures above the onset of the evaporation transition near
kBTevap = 0.15 eV. The dimers and trimers in turn disso-
ciate at temperatures near the second local maximum. For
smaller volumes (larger densities) the eﬀect is not visible
because the signatures become very broad.

To quantify the eﬀect, Fig. 7(a) shows the maxima of
the evaporation anomaly of the speciﬁc heat as a function
of the cluster size at constant densities of ρ = N/L3 =
1.625
0 , which correspond for N = 13 to L/r0 =
20 as shown in Fig. 5(a). The temperature of the speciﬁc
heat maximum increases with increasing size for N

but for N
creasing cluster size. In other words, especially the dimers
and trimers are more stable with respect to larger clus-
ters. The superposition of their speciﬁc heat maxima at
kBTmax = 0.415(5) eV and kBTmax = 0.275(5) eV for
the dimer and trimer, respectively, leads to the second
maximum of the curve for L/r0 = 20 in Fig. 5(a). Fig.

L/r0 = 20, where a dissociated single atom, two dimers

to the eye. The minimum at N = 6 implies that those clusters
dissociate ﬁrst while trimers and dimers are stable to much
higher temperatures. Larger clusters dissociate predominantly
into dimers and trimers at intermediate temperatures as shown
by the snapshot in panel (b) for Al13 at kBT = 0.25 eV. SR

Al55 (not shown) with kBTmax = 0.23(1) eV at similar
densities.

≤

Note that the stability of the dimers and trimers to-
wards dissociation is an entropic eﬀect since the binding
energy per atom decreases monotonously with decreasing
size for N
13 [30]. Consequently the observed presence
of dimers and trimers is not in contradiction with the
results from density functional theory calculations [31],
which ﬁnd the single atom emission to be energetically the
dominant dissociation channel. The dimers and trimers
are at least in part formed by fusion of single evaporated
atoms. On the other hand, this fragmentation behaviour is
not directly transferable to experiments on Al clusters be-
cause the Gupta potentials do not yield the correct planar
structure for N

5 [23,31].

7 Conclusions

The results from the Monte-Carlo simulation of AlN clus-
ters modelled with many-body GPs reveals the appear-
ance of a distinct feature of the melting transition in the
speciﬁc heat and the Berry parameter for N
6. The
energy ﬂuctuations in the canonical ensemble lead to an
onset of isomer ﬂuctuations at lower temperatures than
in the microcanonical ensemble. AlN clusters with N
4
are liquid at the bulk melting temperature. The present
analysis suggests that a generalised suﬃcient criterion for
clusters not to be considered solid any more is a Berry
0.1. Larger clusters with closed-shell
parameter of δB
conﬁgurations exhibit sharper signatures of the melting
transition than others.

For higher temperatures clusters of all sizes undergo a
dissociation transition which is accompanied by container
volume dependent anomalies both in the speciﬁc heat and
Berry parameter. Dimers and trimers are more stable to-
wards dissociation than larger clusters. The details of the

(b)

features depend on the potential but the qualitative re-
sults are generic. For example, MC simulations with GPs
and parameters for Au yield qualitatively very similar re-
sults.

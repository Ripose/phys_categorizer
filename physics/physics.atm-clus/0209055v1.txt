Optimization of molecular clusters conﬁgurations using a Genetic Algorithm

Abstract. We present a genetic algorithm developed (GA) to optimize molecular
AF6 cluster conﬁgurations with respect to their energy. The method is based on
the Darvin’s evolutionary theory: structures with lowest energies survive in a system
of ﬁxed number of clusters. Two existing structures from a given population are
combined in a special way to produce a new structure (child) which is kept if its energy
is lower than the highest energy in the ensemble. To keep the population constant
we reject the structure with the highest energy. This algorithm gives a better result
than the optimization techniques used previously. Using the GA we have found a new
structure corresponding to the (seemingly) global minimum. The most important
result is that the new structure is detected only if the molecular cluster contains
more than a critical number of molecules.

1.

Introduction

Optimized structures give a detailed information
about symmetry, phase transitions and we also can
use them to calculate density of states of the studied
substance. Every optimization algorithm tries to ﬁnd
the conﬁguration with the lowest energy. Usually it
minimizes the potential energy performing consecu-
tive steps from one to another conﬁguration by in-
specting the local minima on the potential energy
surface (PES). Molecular clusters made of octahe-
dral molecules (AF6, A = S, Se, T e, U ) have rugged
potential energy surface [1]. Attempts to use simulat-
ing annealing [2] to ﬁnd the global energy minimum
in the systems often fail due to high-energy barriers
(Fig.7 in [3]), which trap the simulated system in
one of the innumerable metastable conﬁgurations.
A cartoon can be seen in Fig. 1. On such a sur-
face, techniques like simulated annealing, quenching
[2], or the conjugate gradient method ﬁnd the local
”global” (glocal) minimum , which might lie higher
than the true global minimum if it is localed in an-

other basin [4]. Hence we need an algorithm, which
would permit ”jumps” from one basin to another
and sample properly the phase space. Various tech-
niques of global optimization have been proposed:
basin hopping [5], genetic algorithm [6], adiabatic
switching [7].

In the present work we further elaborate GA origi-
nally developed of Deaven and Ho for atomic systems
in order to make it applicable to molecular clusters.
We implement the new algorithm for conﬁguration
optimization of AF6 clusters, simulated with molec-
ular dynamics [1]. A new structure has been found
that has never been seen in our previous investiga-
tions [8], [1].

2. A genetic algorithm for molecular

clusters

In this section we describe our genetic algorithm in
detail. Each molecule is deﬁned with a pair of co-
ordinates {x, q} = ~X, x = {x, y, z} is the Carte-
sian coordinate of molecular center of mass, q =

and the molecules of G′ which lie below the plane.
If the child generated in this manner does not con-
tain the correct number of molecules, we translate
the plane until the child G′′ contains the correct
number of molecules. Relaxation to the nearest lo-
cal minimum is performed with a conjugate gradient
minimization [9, 3].

We preferentially select parents with a lower en-
ergy from {G}. The probability p(G) of an individual
candidate G to be selecting for mating is given by
the Boltzmann distribution.

Configuration space

p(G) ∝ exp[−E(G)/KbTm]

Figure 1. Schematic representation of Potential En-
ergy Surface (PES).

{q0, q1, q2, q3} is molecular orientation in quaternion
representation. We denote a cluster conﬁguration
with N molecules with:

G = { ~X1, ~X2, ..., ~XN }

The genetic algorithm uses a population of n struc-
tures {G}, n is kept constant during the optimization
run. We deﬁne a mapping operator P : P (G, G′) →
G′′, which performs the following action upon two
parent geometries G and G′ to produce a child G′′.
First we select parents from the population using
the distribution Eqn.(1). Second, we choose planes
that account for the parent clusters packing symme-
try and pass through the center of mass of the par-
ents. Then we cut the clusters in the chosen planes.
We would like to underline that the choice of cutting
planes is crucial for the proper work of the algorithm.
In other words, it is very important to ﬁnd out the
packing symmetry of all clusters in the populations.
In the case of solid molecular clusters at a low tem-
perature, the centers of the molecules hardly move
but their orientations do. Hence, in the present ver-
sion of Genetic Algorithm, we match centers of the
parent clusters before searching for a suitable plane.
After cutting the parents, we assemble the child G′′
from the molecules of G which lie above the plane

where E(G) is the energy of the candidate G, Kb
is the Boltzmann constant and Tm is the mating
”temperature”, chosen to be roughly equal to the
range of energies in {G}. For a better performance
we can apply mutations to some members (µ) of
the population. The mutation operator is deﬁned as
M : M (G) → G′ which performs two random ac-
tions with the same probability. First, M moves the
coordinates of mass centers in a random direction
with a random step. Second, M rotates the chosen
molecule at a random angle. Such mutation can be
applied to some molecules in a cluster G or to all of
them.

We create subsequent generations as follows. Par-
ents are continuously chosen from {G} with a prob-
ability given by Eqn.(1) and mated using the mat-
ing procedure described above. The fraction µ of the
children generated in this way are mutated; µ = 0
means no mutation occurs. The (possibly mutated)
child is relaxed to the nearest local minimum and re-
placed with a conﬁguration with a higher energy in
population {G} if its energy is lower than the higher
energy. This algorithm requires a great number of
members (n) in the population in order to prevent a
rapid convergence to a set of identical candidates.

3. Results for T eF6 clusters

To illustrate the method, we used conﬁgurations for
T eF6 clusters obtained in MD simulations described
elsewhere [1].

Figure 2. A population of n = 100 clusters each con-
taining 89 T eF6 molecules ﬁnds the conﬁguration
with the lowest energy about 160 iteration steps.

Fig. 2 shows the minimum energy found in an op-
timization of n=100 conﬁgurations (starting popula-
tion) of 89-molecule T eF6 clusters. During the ﬁrst
100 iterations, the algorithm eﬀectively and rapidly
creates better children. Then the process is slowed
after the 100th step. An important comment is that
we start with a population of structures already op-
timized with conjugate gradient or simulated anneal-
ing methods. We underline that both techniques give
the same optimized structures.

In the case of 89 and 137 T eF6 clusters we have
found a new local minimum on the PES which cor-
responds to quite a diﬀerent structure with respect
to the orientational order. Fig. 3 represents these
orientational structures produced with two diﬀerent
minimization algorithms, e.g. the conjugate gradient
and genetic algorithm.

We have found that in the case of T eF6 clusters
with 27 and 59 molecules such an orientation distri-
bution can not be found as it is seen in Fig. 4. This
is a pronounced size eﬀect. For the case of 89 T eF6
clusters we perform a sequential molecular dynamic
run to check if this new structure is stable. Start-
ing from a low temperature ≈ 0.5 K, we increased
the temperature up to 30 K and the structure is still
stable.

Figure 4. The distributions of the mutual orienta-

59) cannot pack in the new structure.

4. Conclusion

Although the topography of the studied PES is
very complicated, the newly developed algorithm has
shown a great ability to ﬁnd the ”glocal” minimum.
Mutations often boost this ability but in some cases

it becomes worst. One can optimize the mutation pa-
rameters (percentage of mutated-cluster, mutation
operator M , etc.) to obtain better results [10]. Fi-
nally, we have found that the genetic algorithm can
used to ”clean” defects in structures optimized with
techniques. For instance, the free molecular clusters
have many surface molecules oriented improperly in
comparison to the others even in the lowest energy
conﬁguration found with any other method. Such a
procedure (cleaning) is very important if the density
of states is needed. The general shortcoming of the
method is its slowness, which makes its application
limited.

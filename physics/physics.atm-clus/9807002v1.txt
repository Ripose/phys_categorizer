The magnetic susceptibility of electrons conﬁned to a
spherical cavity or a circular billiard shows slow oscillations
as a function of the number of electrons, which are a new
manifestation of the Super Shell Structure found in the free
energy of metal clusters. The relationship of the oscillations of
the two diﬀerent quantities is analyzed by means of semiclas-
sical calculations, which are in quantitative agreement with
quantal results. The oscillations should be observable for en-
sembles of circular ballistic quantum dots and metal clusters.

I. INTRODUCTION

The conﬁnement of independent Fermions in 2 or 3 di-
mensions (2D or 3D) leads to a bunching of the single
particle levels, if the mean free path of the Fermions is
large compared to the size of the system. This is known
as shell structure (SS) and leads to oscillations of the
total energy as function of particle number N around
a smoothly changing background. The oscillating part,
referred to as shell energy, has minima at the so called
magic numbers, which have been known for a long time
for nuclei. More recently they have been observed in
the abundance spectra of alkali metal clusters (c.f. [1]
and the original work cited therein), representing min-
ima of the free energy [2]. Later on, it has been found
[3], that the amplitude of these shell oscillations is mod-
ulated by a slow oscillation. This so called Super Shell
Structure (SSS) had been predicted theoretically [4,5].
In this paper we will show that the magnetic susceptibil-
ity follows a similar SSS pattern. Using the Strutinsky’s
shell correction method [6–8] and semiclassical Periodic
Orbit Theory (POT), we will trace the SSS of the sus-
ceptibility and free energy back to the same interference
pattern between electrons on classical periodic orbits.

The consequences of SS for the magnetic susceptibility
of the conﬁned electron gas have been discussed in refs.
[9–13] and earlier references cited therein. The suscepti-
bility of a conﬁned ballistic 2D electron gas can be mea-
sured for large ensemble of quantum dots on a AlGaAs -
GaAs semi conductor hetero structure [9]. For this type
of experiments it is claimed [9,11–13] that the shell os-
cillations as a function of the electron number N are av-
eraged out by the ﬂuctuations of the size and the shape
of the individual dots. The only Quantum Size Eﬀect

(QSE) expected to survive is a paramagnetic enhance-
ment of the susceptibility, which changes smoothly with

should permit to resolve the slow oscillations reﬂecting
the SSS. We will also discuss the experimental possibili-
ties to detect SSS of the magnetic susceptibility of metal-
lic clusters.

The shell structure of θcr has been analyzed for nuclear
rotation (where it is called cranking moment of inertia).
Following the concepts of Strutinsky’s shell correction
method [6,7], Ω, θcr and other quantities are divided into
a smooth part and into an shell part (denoted by the
subscript SH). The shell contribution to θcr, which we
call θSH , represents the total QSE, because the shell part
of θrig is negligible as compared to θSH. The partition
can either be done numerically starting from the quantal
electron levels [6–8] or it can be based on semiclassical
periodic orbit theory (POT). In the latter case the shell
terms read [16,17,13]

Since the energy to extract one electron from the con-
ﬁning potential is much higher than the temperature, it
is important to use the canonical ensemble and deﬁne
(∂2F/∂ω2)ω=0
the susceptibility as the derivative θ =
of the free energy at ﬁxed particle number N . The im-
portance of the ﬁxed electron number for the magnetic

properties of 2D-structures has been pointed out previ-
ously [12,13]. We adopt the approximation valid for large
N , calculating F (T, N, ω) = Ω(T, λ, ω) + λN , where λ is
found from the condition

∂Ω(T, λ, ω)/∂λ = N .

The zero ﬁeld susceptibility is given by the expressions
(3) or (6) taken at λ(N ) ﬁxed by eq. (14) at ω = 0. We
solve this equation numerically both for the semiclassical
and the quantum calculation.

III. SPHERICAL CAVITY

Fig. 1 shows θSH (N, T ) calculated by means of the
numerical Strutinsky averaging procedure [8] from the
quantal levels in a spherical cavity. The parameters are
appropriate for sodium. As a unit we use the Landau
diamagnetic susceptibility (LU) for the electron gas in the
S. Since all contributions to
cavity,
the bulk susceptibility are of the same order of magnitude
[15], the ﬁgure shows directly the enhancement due to the
QSE.

fective mass is M = Me, the radius R = rsN 1/3 with
rs = 0.208 nm, the Fermi energy εF = 3.24 eV and the
temperature T = 0.005εF = 170 K. The thin line shows the
results without averaging over N 1/3 and the fat ones after av-
eraging with a Gaussian of width ∆N 1/3 = 0.75. Inset: solid
and dashed lines show the quantum and semiclassical calcu-
lations for the canonical ensemble, respectively. Dots present
the grand canonical quantum result (ﬁxed λ = εF ).

The susceptibility θSH oscillates with the period of the
shells. In addition its amplitude is modulated with a slow
oscillation, which is the “Super Shell Structure” (SSS),
ﬁrst noticed for the level density [4,5]. It was found ex-
perimentally in the abundances of Na clusters [3], which
are determined by FSH [2], showing also the SSS pattern
(cf. Fig. 2).

We have also evaluated θSH by means of the POT
sums (6). As seen in the inset of Fig. 1, the quan-
tal values of θSH agree very well with ones obtained

k/T M is the characteristic “tempera-

results from the superposition of the two leading terms,
the triangle and the square. The basic oscillation has
a period given by k(L△ + L✷)/2 and the beat oscillates
with k(L✷
L△). Fig. 3 shows a calculation that takes
into account only the triangle and the square. Compar-
ing with the full calculation, the inﬂuence of the longer
orbits is seen. Although they make the peaks higher the
beat pattern is not much changed up to N 1/3
16. The
upper and lower envelops of the full calculation are not
very diﬀerent from the ones of the truncated calculation.
This demonstrates that the beat pattern is basically gen-
erated by the triangle and the square. For N 1/3

SSS minima are less pronounced for θSH than for FSH .
There the triangle and square cancel each other. The
main contribution comes from longer orbits, which are
much more important for θSH than for FSH , preventing
θSH from becoming as small as FSH . This interpreta-
tion is also supported by Fig. 3. The diﬀerence between
the full and truncated calculations, which represents the
contribution of the longer orbits, is just an up-shift of the
upper envelop .

FIG. 3. Shell contribution θSH of the magnetic suscepti-
bility of N electrons in a spherical cavity. The thin line shows
the same as ﬁg. 1, the thick line corresponds to a calculation
where only the triangular and square orbits in the POT sums
(6) are taken into account. For N 1/3 < 6 the level density is
not positive deﬁnite in this approximation and the solution of
eq. (14) is not possible.

The SSS is clearly developed for the temperature of
T = 0.005εF , shown in Fig.
1. For T = 0.0005εF
we ﬁnd very pronounced SS with an amplitude of a few
thousand LU, but little SSS. The averaged susceptibility
stays around 1500 LU with small peaks (400 LU high)
at N 1/3 = 7 and 13. Due to a weak temperature damp-
ing in the POT sum many orbits contribute to the sum,
destroying the simple beat pattern. This is at variance
with a distinct SSS pattern in FSH persisting to T = 0
[4,5]. The reason is the factor 1/Υβ which suppresses the
orbits with high p. For T = 0.05εF there is SSS, but the
amplitude of the basic shell oscillations remains below 5
LU for N < 100, becoming small compared with the LU
for larger N . Hence, the intermediate temperature seems
to be optimal for the observation of the SSS.

IV. RELATION TO THE SHELL STRUCTURE IN
THE FREE ENERGY

The relation between the shell contributions to the zero
ﬁeld free energy, FSH , and to the susceptibility, θSH , is
understood by comparing the two POT sums (6). The

V. CANONICAL ENSEMBLE

due to the higher orders in δk the minima are narrowed
to cusps and the maxima take the shape of parabolas.

Experimentally, the average susceptibility of an ensem-
ble of clusters with a distribution in N will be measured.
Let us consider a Gaussian distribution in N 1/3 of width
∆(N 1/3) = 0.75, which corresponds to about one os-
cillation. As shown in Fig.1, averaging the susceptibil-
ity damps out only the basic shell oscillations, whereas
the SSS remains as a modulation of the strongly para-
magnetic susceptibility. Hence, it is expected that the
SSS can be observed with a moderate mass selection of
the clusters that would not allow to resolve the basic SS
(∆N/N = 0.23 for N = 1000 in Fig. 1).

The QSE of the susceptibility survives the averaging
only for the canonical ensemble [9,11–13]. The inset of
Fig. 1 compares the canonical with grand canonical en-
semble (λ = εF ). Though the positions of the extrema
are similar, the shape of peaks is rather diﬀerent. For
the grand canonical ensemble the negative and positive
values are equally probable and, as the result, averag-
ing with respect to N quenches θSH. For the canonical
ensemble, the positive values are more frequent and the
QSE survives the averaging with respect to N . The pref-
erence of θSH > 0 for the canonical ensemble is evident
from POT sum (6): The shell correction to the level den-
sity gSH, which is given by setting the factor
= 1,
oscillates in phase with θSH , i. e. more N values cor-
respond to a paramagnetic than to a diamagnetic sus-
ceptibility and the average with respect to the particle
number is positive.

Let us discuss this correlation in more detail, because
it is crucial for the measurability of the SSS. Fig. 3 illus-
trates that the typical inverted parabolas appear already
for the lowest orbits. It is suﬃcient to consider only one
term in (6), say the triangle. For the grand canonical
ensemble, the wave number k = kF is constant (kF is the
N 1/3. The
Fermi Gas value). The orbit length is L△
susceptibility is proportional to sin(kF L△) (for simplicity
the phase ν△ is left away), which averages to zero. The
particle number expectation value as given by (14) con-
tains a term proportional to
cos(kF L△) that makes it
oscillating around N . Thus, for the canonical ensemble,
the wave number k = kF +δk cannot be constant. It must
contain an oscillating term δk in order to satisfy eq. (14).
In order to understand qualitatively its consequences for
the susceptibility we use an argument from refs. [12,13].
Retaining only the linear order of δk, eq.
(14) gives
δk
cos(kF L△). The susceptibility is proportional to
sin((kF + δk)L△)
The second term is proportional to cos(kF L△)2 which
averages to 1/2. Hence, the total averaged susceptibility
is positive. Since the interference between the triangular
and quadratic orbits in both θSH and gSH is about the
same, the SSS modulates paramagnetic term also after
averaging. The oscillations of δk narrow the minima and
broaden the maxima of the susceptibility. In our calcu-
lations, δk is treated exactly. As seen in Figs. 1 and 3,

sin(kF L△) + δkL△ cos(kF L△).

VI. REAL CLUSTERS

Real clusters deviate from the perfect spherical cav-
ity: The surface has a ﬁnite thickness of the order of the
screening length. The discrete ionic back ground implies
a certain surface roughness of the order of the interatomic
distance. There may be impurities or other imperfections
distributed over the volume.

The SS in a spherical potential with a realistic surface
thickness (the one of sodium) has been studied in ref.
[5]. The SSS in the binding energies is clearly developed.
The beat minima are somwhat shifted as compared to
the cavity. The shift has been be traced back to small
changes of the action of the POT due to the modiﬁed “re-
ﬂection” by the ﬁnite potential at the surface. Since the
expressions (6) hold also for the more realistic potentials
if the appropriate action S is inserted, a similar shift of
the SSS pattern can be infered for the susceptibility.

The consequences of the surface roughness for the shell
structure of the ground state energy have been studied
in ref. [21]. The energy is given by the POT sum (6),
where each term contains an additional damping factor
χp. Assuming that the rough surface is randomly dis-
placed relative to the ideal one, the damping factor is

χp = exp (

2p(σk sin φ)2),

−

(16)

∼

rS is used.

where a Gaussian displacement distribution with the
width σ
It has a simple interpretation.
The number of reﬂection on the surface is p. For each re-
ﬂection the rough surface scatters a certain fraction of the
particles away from the POT. The arguments of ref. [21]
can be immediately taken over to the zero ﬁeld suscep-
tibility. The damping factor arises from the reﬂections
on the irregular surface. A weak magnetic ﬁeld does not
change the reﬂections on the surface 1 and the damping
factor (16) appears also in the susceptibility. Hence, the
long orbits (large number of reﬂections p) are strongly
suppressed by the surface roughness.
In ref. [21] it is
shown that a roughness σ = 0.2rS = 0.38/kF reduces
the amplitude of the SS to about 1/2 of the one of the
ideal cavity. The SSS is found to be nearly the same
as for the ideal cavity. For the susceptibility one expects
that the surface roughness strongly reduces the contribu-
tions of the long orbits, such that the SSS pattern of Fig.
1 approaches the one of Fig. 3 with a reduced amplitude.

1The diﬀerence beween the case with a weak and without
a ﬁeld is the small curvature of the trajectory between the
reﬂection points which barely changes the angles of the tra-
jectory with the surface.

4

In particular, for very low temperature the surface rough-
ness is expected to enhance the SSS, because it eﬃciently
damps the long orbits.

Impurities or other imperfections that are homoge-
neously distributed over the volume will also scatter the
particles away from the POT. The situation is analogous
to the propagation of a wave in an absorbing medium,
which has been considered in ref. [4]. The scattering
results in a damping factor of the form exp (
Lβ/ΛI),
where 1/ΛI measures the amount of scattering per unit
length and corresponds to the mean free path of the elec-
trons due to the imperfections. This kind of damping is
equivalent with an increase of the temperature, because

VII. MEASUREMENTS OF THE
SUSCEPTIBILITY OF METAL CLUSTERS

≈

In Ref. [14] the susceptibility has been measured for
three ensembles of clusters with the average size of
N 1/3
4, 2 and 1.5 and a large spread in size. A param-
agnetic enhancement of 5, 2 and 1.5 is found, respectively.
The decrease of the enhancement with N , which ref. [14]
mentions as an unexplained phenomenon, can be seen
in Fig. 1. To identify the SSS, experiments with more
points in N and a mass resolution better than 30% are
needed. An alternative experiment would be the mea-
surement of the deﬂection of a cold cluster beam in an
inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, which provides directly
the susceptibility. To reach the necessary sensitivity of
such a Stern-Gerlach apparatus seems to be possible [22].
It is favourable for this kind of experiment that only a
moderate mass selection is needed to observe SSS, what
permits larger intensities.

∼

Measuring the susceptibility could shed new light on
the electronic structure of small metal clusters. Solid
icosahedral shapes have been suggested for sodium clus-
ters with T
200K [23]. Our sphere model should be
a rough ﬁrst approximation for N < 1000. In this range
the shell energies ESH for the spherical and icosahedral
cavity are similar [24] and, as discussed above, the same
can be expected for the susceptibilities. A more pro-
nounced paramagnetic SSS is expected if shape of the
cold clusters comes close to a rough sphere. The picture
changes, if the clusters were liquid or would keep keep
the same shape as in the liquid state when freezing at
low T . Then magic clusters are spherical and strongly
diamagnetic, whereas the non magical ones are deformed
and weakly diamagnetic [20]. Thus, the averaged suscep-
tibility would be diamagnetic, still showing a SSS.

VIII. HALF SPHERE

Fig. 4 shows the susceptibility for a half sphere with
R = rS(N/2)1/3. The results are very similar to the full
sphere. The main diﬀerence is a shift of the basic shell os-
cillations by half a period. The averaged susceptibility is
almost indistinguishable from Fig. 1. Cluster deposited
on an insulating surface may take shapes close to half
spheres [25–27].

beat pattern for a circular dot has been ﬁrst calculated
in [13]. However, it is argued there and also in [11,12]
that when averaging over the ensemble of dots used as
experimental probe, uncertainties in the shape and size
will completely wipe out the shell structure, the only re-
maining QSE being a paramagnetic enhancement that
varies smoothly with N . In contrast, Fig. 5 shows that
averaging with a Gaussian of width ∆N 1/2 = 1.6 ( cor-
responding to a 10% spread in N for N = 1000) destroys
only the basic SS, whereas the SSS remains visible.

∼

∼

Nowadays it is possible to manufacture probes with a
large number of circular quantum dots, specifying the
radius and the gate voltage with a 5% accuracy [28].
Changing the number of electrons in the dots by means of
the gate voltage seems to be a possibility to measure the

5

SSS of the susceptibility. The imperfections in manufac-
turing circular dots will have similar eﬀects as discussed
above for the metal clusters. The discussion of the 3D
case can directly be applied to the 2D case. Thus, the
SSS pattern is expected to survive if the surface rough-
ness σ < 0.4/kF .

bility of N electrons in a circular well. The eﬀective mass is
M = 0.067Me, the well radius R = 500 nm and the tempera-
ture T = 5¯h2/2M R2 ≈ 0.13K . The line conventions are the
same as in Fig. 1. Averaging over N 1/2 is carried out with
a Gaussian of width ∆N 1/2 = 1.6. The non averaged values
are divided by a factor of 10.

Fig. 6 demonstrates that, at variance with the 3D
case, FSH (N ) signiﬁcantly diﬀers from θSH (N ). For 2D
case, the diameter orbit is not suppressed in FSH . The
interference of the diameter, triangle and square results
in slower basic and faster beat oscillations as compared
to θSH , for which the diameter is missing. Averaging
with respect to N 1/2 ﬁlters out the slow oscillation due
to the interference between triangle and square, which
mainly modulates FSH (N ). The SS of the free energy
should show up as a modulation of the capacitance of
the dot. It is given by d2F/dN 2, which also determines
the abundances of heavy clusters [2].

X. CONCLUSIONS

The susceptibility of electrons conﬁned in two or three
dimensions by a spherical potential oscillates as func-
tion of their number. This shell structure is modulated
by slow oscillations, the Super Shell Structure, which
only develops at suﬃciently high temperatures. Mea-
surements that average out the shell structure may still
reveal the Super Shell Structure. The free energy of elec-
trons conﬁned in three dimensions, shows the analogous
Super Shell pattern, which is observed in the abundances
of metal clusters. However, for the two dimensional po-
tential the shell structure of the free energy diﬀers con-
siderably from the one of the susceptibility.

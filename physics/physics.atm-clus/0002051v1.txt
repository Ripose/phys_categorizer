The thermal expansion coeﬃcients of NaN clusters with
14 are obtained from ab ini-
8 ≤ N ≤ 40 and Al7, Al−
tio Born-Oppenheimer LDA molecular dynamics. Thermal
expansion of small metal clusters is considerably larger than
that in the bulk and size-dependent. We demonstrate that
the average static electric dipole polarizability of Na clusters
depends linearly on the mean interatomic distance and only
to a minor extent on the detailed ionic conﬁguration when the
overall shape of the electron density is enforced by electronic
shell eﬀects. The polarizability is thus a sensitive indicator
for thermal expansion. We show that taking this eﬀect into
account brings theoretical and experimental polarizabilities
into quantitative agreement.

Since electronic shell eﬀects were put into evidence in
small metallic systems [1–4], metal clusters have conti-
nously attracted great interest both experimentally and
theoretically [5–10]. Besides technological prospects, one
of the driving forces for this research has been the funda-
mental question of how matter develops from the atom to
systems of increasing size, and how properties change in
the course of this growing process. In some cases it has
been possible to extract detailed information from ex-
periments done at low temperatures [11] and the related
theories [12]. In many cases, however, a deeper under-
standing is complicated by the ﬁnite temperature which
is present in most experiments due to the cluster pro-
duction process, see e.g. the discussion in [13]. Whereas
a lot of theoretical information about ﬁnite temperature
eﬀects in nonmetallic systems has been gained in the last
years [14], only little is known about it in metallic clus-
ters. Here, sodium is a particularly interesting reference
system because of its textbook metallic properties and
the fact that it has been extensively studied within the
jellium model, see e.g. [15] for an overview. Aluminum,
on the other hand, is of considerable technological inter-
est. Some advances to study temperature eﬀects in metal
clusters including the ionic degrees of freedom were made
using phenomenological molecular dynamics [16], a tight-
binding hamiltonian [17], the Thomas-Fermi approxima-
tion [18] or the Car-Parrinello method [19]. Recently, it
has also become possible to study sodium clusters of con-
siderable size [20] using ab initio Born-Oppenheimer, lo-
cal spin density molecular dynamics (BO-LSD-MD) [21].
In this work we report on the size dependence of a
thermal property which is well known for bulk systems,

(1)

For crystalline sodium at room temperature, it takes [22]
the value 71 × 10−6K −1, for Al 23.6 × 10−6K −1. To
the present date, however, it has not been known how
small systems are aﬀected by thermal expansion. At ﬁrst
sight, it is not even obvious how thermal expansion can
be deﬁned in small clusters. Whereas in the bulk it is no
problem to deﬁne the length l appearing in Eq. (1), e.g.
the lattice constant, it is less straightforward to choose a
meaningful l in the case where many diﬀerent ionic ge-
ometries must be compared to one another. For small
metal clusters, the latter situation arises because of the
many diﬀerent isomers which appear at elevated temper-
atures.

We have calculated the thermal expansion coeﬃcients
for Na8, Na10, Na12, Na14, Na20 and Na40 in BO-LSD-
MD simulations. Results concerning isomerization pro-
cesses in these simulations have been presented in [23],
and the BO-LSD-MD method is described in detail in
Ref. [21]. A meaningful length to be used in Eq. (1) if it
is applied to ﬁnite systems with similar overall deforma-
tion is the mean interatomic distance

lmiad =

where Ri are the positions of the N atoms in the clus-
ter. Obviously, lmiad measures the average “extension”
of a clusters ionic structure, and we calculated it for all
conﬁgurations obtained in a BO-LSD-MD run. Two dif-
ferent methods were used to calculate β. First, we discuss
the heating runs, in which the clusters were thermalized
to a starting temperature and then heated linearly with
a heating rate of 5K/ps and a time step of 5.2 fms. lmiad
was recorded after each time step. In this way, for Na8
the temperature range from about 50 K to 670 K was
covered, corresponding to 24140 conﬁgurations, for Na10
from ca. 150 K to 390 K (9260 conﬁgurations), for Na14
from ca. 50 K to 490 K (17020 conﬁgurations), for Na20
from ca. 170 K to 380 K (8000 conﬁgurations), and for
Na40 from ca. 200 K to 400 K (7770 conﬁgurations).

Fig. 1 shows how lmiad changes with temperature for
Na8 and Na10. Both curves show large ﬂuctuations, as
is to be expected for such small systems. However, one
clearly sees a linear rise as the general trend. We there-
fore made linear ﬁts to the data for each cluster in two

ways. The ﬁrst column in the left half of table I gives the
linear thermal expansion coeﬃcients which we obtained
from ﬁtting the data in the temperature interval between
200 K and 350 K, i.e. around room temperature, where
bulk sodium is usually studied. In order to allow for an
estimate of the statistical quality of the ﬁts in view of
the ﬂuctuations, the second and third column in the left
half of Table I list the ratio of the ﬁt parameters, i.e.
the axis interception a and the slope b, to their stan-
dard deviations. It becomes clear from these results that
thermal expansion in the small clusters is considerably
larger than that in the bulk. This can be understood as
an eﬀect of the increased surface to volume ratio in the
ﬁnite systems. However, the expansion coeﬃcient also
strongly depends on the cluster size. This can even be
seen directly from the diﬀerent slopes in Fig. 1. As we
will show below, this size dependence has far reaching
consequences for the interpretation of experimental data
which is usually measured on hot clusters, as e.g. the
static electric polarizability.

In addition to the values given in Table I, we calcu-
lated the expansion coeﬃcient of Na12 with a diﬀerent
method. In two separate runs, the cluster was thermal-
ized to temperatures of about 200 K and 350 K, and
then BO-LSD-MD was performed for 5 ps at each tem-
perature, i.e. without heating. From the average lmiad
found in the two simulations, βNa12 = 2.5 βbulk was cal-
culated. Thus, also the second method leads to a β that
is larger than that of the bulk, i.e. it conﬁrms the results
of the heating runs.

sion coeﬃcient of small Na clusters in the temperature inter-
val between 200 and 350 K, given in terms of the bulk value
71 × 10−6K −1. Columns two and three give the ratio of the

text for discussion.

temperature range covered in each simulation is obtained
from a ﬁt to the complete set of data, shown as a dashed
line in Fig. 1 for Na8 and Na10. This average is of inter-
est because it covers several hundred K for each cluster
in the range of temperatures which are to be expected
for clusters coming from the usual supersonic expansion
sources [24]. The right half of table I lists these average
expansion coeﬃcients and their statistical deviations in
the same way as before. As is to be expected, the val-
ues diﬀer from the previous ones for the small clusters,
because the expansion coeﬃcient is inﬂuenced by which
isomers are or become accessible at a particular tempera-
ture, i.e. especially at low temperatures it is temperature
dependent. In Fig. 1 one e.g. sees from comparison with
the average dashed line that for temperatures between 50
K and 100 K, the thermal expansion is smaller than that
seen for higher temperatures. However, once the cluster
has reached a temperature where it easily changes from
one isomer to another, the thermal expansion coeﬃcient
becomes nearly independent of the temperature. In the
case of Na8, e.g., β changes only by about 5 % in the
interval between 300 K and 670 K.

Detailed previous investigations [20,23] have shown
that small clusters do not show a distinct melting tran-
sition. However, the largest cluster studied here, Na40,
shows a phase transition above 300 K [20]. At the melt-
ing point, the octupole and hexadecupole deformation of
the electronic density sharply increase. If lmiad is a rele-
vant indicator for structural changes, then melting should
also be detectable from it. Indeed we ﬁnd a noticeable
increase in lmiad at 300 K, and similar ﬂuctuation pat-
terns as in the multipole moments.
In our simulation,
we could only determine the expansion coeﬃcient for the
solid phase, and it is given in the right half of table I.

As seen in Fig. 1, Na8 shows thermal expansion already
at 50 K. This raises the question at which temperature
the expansion actually starts, i.e. where anharmonic ef-
fects in the ionic oscillations will start to become impor-
tant. In this context we note that one can compare the
lmiad at T=0 K found by extrapolation from the heating

data to the lmiad which is actually found for the ground
state structure at T=0 K. We have done this for Na8,
Na10 and Na14, where the ground state structures are
well established. In all cases, the diﬀerences between the
two values were less than 1%. This indicates that the an-
harmonic eﬀects for Na clusters are important down to
very low temperatures. Furthermore, the anharmonici-
ties should also be observable in the heat capacities [20],
where they will lead to deviations from Dulong-Petit’s
law. We have checked this and indeed found deviations
between 8 % (Na20) and 19 % (Na8) from the Dulong-
Petit value.

As an example for the considerable inﬂuence of ther-
mal expansion on measurable physical properties we dis-
cuss the average static electric dipole polarizability α,
which is deﬁned as the trace of the polarizability ten-
sor. It was one of the ﬁrst observables from which the
existence of electronic shell eﬀects in metal clusters was
deduced [1], and it has been measured for clusters of var-
ious sizes and materials [10]. For Na clusters with up
to eight atoms, the polarizability was also calculated in
diﬀerent approaches [5–7,9,10]. These calculations qual-
itatively reproduce the experimentaly observed trends,
but they all underestimate the measured value. We show
that this discrepancy is to a large part due to the fact
that the calculations were done for T=0, whereas the
measurement is done on clusters having temperatures of
about 400 to 600 K [24].

For various, diﬀerent isomers obtained in our heating
runs for Na8 and Na10, we have calculated the polariz-
ability from the derivative of the induced dipole moment
with respect to the electric ﬁeld (ﬁnite ﬁeld method).
Since highly unsymmetric isomers from the high temper-
ature part of the simulations were taken into account,
the full tensor was computed by numerically applying
the dipole ﬁeld in the diﬀerent directions in seperate cal-
culations. We have checked that the used ﬁeld strength
of 5 × 10−5e/a2
0 is large enough to give a numerically
stable signal and small enough to be in the regime of
linear response. In Fig. 2 we have plotted the thus ob-
tained polarizabilities versus lmiad, and show three in-
stances of ionic geometries for each cluster that demon-
strate how diﬀerent the structures actually are. Never-
theless, within a few percent the polarizabilities are on a
straight line. This shows that the average polarizability
depends mainly and strongly on the mean interatomic
distance, and only to a minor extent on details in the
ionic conﬁgurations. Of course, the situation might be
more complicated for clusters where the overal shape,
i.e. the lowest terms in the multipole expansion of the
valence electron density, is not stabilized by electronic
shell eﬀects. For the present clusters, however, the de-
formation induced by the electronic shell eﬀects persists
even at elevated temperatures. That α is less sensitive
to the detailed ionic conﬁguration than, e.g., the pho-
toabsorption spectrum, is understandable because it is
an average quantity.

interatomic distance has the consequence that α also
strongly depends on the temperature. From Fig. 2 one
deduces that an average bondlength increase of 1 a0 in
Na8 and Na10 leads to an increase in the polarizability
of about 25 ˚A3. Thus, neglection of the thermal expan-
sion in T=0 calculations leads to polarizabilities which
are smaller than the ones measured on clusters coming
from supersonic expansion sources [1,10]. Of course, also
underestimations of the cluster bond lengths that are due
to other reasons will directly appear in the polarizabil-
ity. With the Troullier-Martins pseudopotential, e.g. the
BO-LSD-MD underestimates the dimer bond length by
4.5%, and it is to be expected that the situation is similar
for the bond lengths of larger clusters. Taking this into
account, one can proceed to calculate the polarizability
for clusters with a temperature corresponding to the ex-
perimental one of about 500 K [24]. In the experiments
the clusters are spending about 10−4s in the deﬂecting
ﬁeld from which the polarizability is deduced, i.e. the ex-
perimental timescale is orders of magnitude larger than
the timescale of the ﬂuctuations in the mean interatomic

distance (see Fig. 1). Thus, the ﬂuctuations will be av-
eraged over and can be neglected. From the average ex-
pansion coeﬃcients we obtain a bond length increase of
0.48 a0 for Na8 and 0.87 a0 for Na10 at 500 K, which in
turn leads to an increase in the polarizability of 12 ˚A3
and 23 ˚A3, respectively. The resulting polarizabilities of
130 ˚A3 for Na8 and 172 ˚A3 for Na10 compare favourably
with the experimental values 134±16˚A3 and 190±20˚A3
[1,10]. For all other cluster sizes, the two experiments
[1,10] give diﬀerent values for the polarizability. From the
present work it becomes clear that diﬀerences in the ex-
perimental temperatures might be the reason for the dis-
crepancies. Therefore, an accurate measurement of the
clusters’ temperatures is necessary before further quan-
titative comparisons can be made. However, a detailed
comparison to both experiments showed that the theo-
retical T=0 polarizability of all isomers underestimates
both experimental results [25]. Thus, the increase in α
that is brought about by thermal expansion will lead to
better agreement between theory and experiment for all
cluster sizes.

Thermal expansion is also observed in aluminum clus-

K, for Al−
14 at
200 K, 570 K and 900 K, in analogy to the procedure
for Na12. From the average lmiad at each temperature,
we calculated the expansion coeﬃcients βAl7 = 1.3 βbulk,
βAl−
= 1.4 βbulk. It should be noted
that with Al−
13 we have chosen an electronically as well as
geometrically magic cluster [26], i.e. a particularly rigid
one, and the fact that it also shows a larger expansion
coeﬃcient than the bulk is further evidence for the con-
clusion that the increased expansion coeﬃcient is indeed
a ﬁnite size eﬀects. A noteworthy diﬀerence between Al
and Na is seen in the temperatures where the expansion
sets in. Whereas for Na this temperature is below 50 K,
we observe that Al−
14 show no expansion below
300 K.

13 and Al−

In summary, we have calculated thermal expansion co-
eﬃcients for small metal cluster and demonstrated that
thermal expansion in these systems is larger than that
in the bulk. For the case of sodium, the dependence of
the expansion coeﬃcient is not monotonous according to
the cluster size. We showed that the average static elec-
tric dipole polarizability of clusters whose overall shape
is ﬁxed by electronic shell eﬀects depends linearly on the
mean interatomic distance. Thus, thermal expansion in-
creases the static electric polarizability, and we demon-
strated that taking this eﬀect into account brings the
theoretical values in a close agreement with the experi-
mental ones.

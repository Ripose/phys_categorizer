I. INTRODUCTION

Dissociation, fragmentation, and ﬁssioning processes underly physical and chemical phe-
nomena in a variety of ﬁnite-size systems, characterized by a wide spectrum of energy scales,
nature of interactions, and characteristic spatial and temporal scales. These include nu-
clear ﬁssion [1,2], unimolecular decay and reactions in atoms and molecules [3], and more
recently dissociation and fragmentation processes in atomic and molecular clusters [4–6].
Investigations of the energetics, mechanisms, pathways, and dynamics of fragmentation
processes provide ways and means for explorations of the structure, stability, excitations,
and dynamics in the many-body ﬁnite systems mentioned above, as well as they allow for
comprehensive tests of theoretical methodologies and conceptual developments, and have
formed active areas of fruitful research endeavors in nuclear physics, and more recently in
cluster science.

Under the general title of dissociation and fragmentation [7] processes in metal clus-
ters, one usually distinguishes two classes of phenomena, i.e., (1) dissociation of neutral
monomers and/or dimers, and (2) ﬁssion. The physical processes in the ﬁrst class are most
often referrred to as evaporation of monomers and/or dimers, since they are endothermic
processes and are usually induced through laser heating of the cluster. The unimolecular
equations associated with these processes are

for dimer separation (N denotes the number of atoms in the clusters [8]). The parent
clusters M +
N have been taken here as being singly ionized, in order to conform with available
experimental measurements [4]. Fission on the other hand, is most often an exothermic
process and is due to the Coulombic forces associated with excess charges on the cluster. It

has been found that the minimum excess charge required to induce ﬁssion is 2 elementary
units (either positive or negative). In this case the doubly-charged parent cluster splits into
two singly charged fragments, and the corresponding unimolecular equation can be written
as

It needs to be emphasized that fragmentation through ﬁssion involves most often the over-
coming of a ﬁssion barrier, while momomer and dimer separation are barrierless processes
[4].

For clusters with N > N Z+

These observations indicate that ﬁssion of metal clusters occurs when the repulsive
Coulomb forces due to the accumulation of the excess charges overcome the electronic
binding (cohesion) of the cluster. This reminds us immediately of the well-studied nuclear
ﬁssion phenomenon and the celebrated Liquid Drop Model (LDM) according to which the
binding nuclear forces are expressed as a sum of volume and surface terms, and the balance
between the Coulomb repulsion and the increase in surface area upon volume conserving
deformations allows for an estimate of the stability and ﬁssility of the nucleus [12,13].

We note that for doubly charged metal clusters with N

12 microscopic descriptions of
energetics and dynamics of ﬁssion, based on ﬁrst-principles electronic-structure calculations
in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, have been performed [10,11] (see
section III.C.1 for details). Several of the trends exhibited by the microscopic calculations
(such as inﬂuence of magic numbers, associated with electronic shell closing, on ﬁssion
energetics and barrier heights; predominance of an asymmetric ﬁssion channel; double-
humped ﬁssion-barrier shapes; shapes of deforming clusters along the ﬁssion trajectory
portraying two fragments connected through a stretching neck) suggest that appropriate
adaptation of methodologies developed originally in the context of nuclear ﬁssion may
provide a useful conceptual and calculational framework for studies of systematics and
patterns of ﬁssion processes in metallic clusters.

In this context, it is useful to comment on the earliest treatments of pertinent nuclear
processes, i.e., ﬁssion [12,1] and alpha radioactivity [14,15,2]. Adaptation of the simple one-
center LDM to charged metallic clusters [5], involving calculation of the Coulomb repulsive
energy due to an excess charge localized at the surface, yields a reduced LDM ﬁssility
parameter ξ = (Z 2/N)/(Z 2/N)cr, where (Z 2/N)cr = 16πr3
sσ/e2 with the surface energy
per unit area denoted by σ and rs being the Wigner-Seitz radius (using bulk rs and σ
N and NaZ+
values, (Z 2/N)cr = 0.44 and 0.39 for KZ+
N , respectively). Accordingly, a cluster

2

is unstable for ξ > 1 (implying that for K2+
N with N
10 barrierless
ﬁssion should occur) with the most favorable channel being the symmetric one (i.e., when
the two fragments have equal masses, which is only approximately true for nuclear ﬁssion,
and certainly not the case for small metal clusters). For 0.351 < ξ < 1, the system is
metastable (i.e., may ﬁssion in a process involving a barrier), and for 0 < ξ < 0.351 the
system is stable.

At the other limit, α-radioactivity, which may be viewed as an extreme case of (su-
perasymmetric) ﬁssion, is commonly described as a process where the fragments are formed
(or as often said, preformed) before the system reaches the top of the barrier (saddle point),
and as a result the barrier is mainly Coulombic [2]. We note here that asymmetric emission
14C+209Pb, referred to as exotic or cluster
of heavier nuclei is also known (e.g., 223Ra
→
radioactivity [16–18]), and the barriers in these cases resemble the one-humped barrier of
alpha radioactivity and do not exhibit modulations due to shell eﬀects [18]. We also remark
that such α-radioactivity-type (essentially Coulombic) barriers have been proposed recently
[19] for describing the overall shape of the ﬁssion barriers in the case of metal clusters.

Although, several aspects of the simple LDM (e.g., competition between Coulomb and
surface terms) and the α-particle, Coulombic model (e.g., asymmetric channels and a scis-
sion conﬁguration close to the location of the saddle of the multi-dimensional potential-
energy surface) are present in the ﬁssion of metal clusters, neither model is adequate in light
of the characteristic behavior revealed from the microscopic calculations and experiments.
Rather, we ﬁnd that proper treatments of ﬁssion in these systems require consideration of
shell eﬀects (for a recent experimental study that demonstrates the importance of shell ef-
fects in metal-cluster ﬁssion, see Ref. [9b]). While such eﬀects are known to have important
consequences in nuclear ﬁssion (transforming the one-humped LDM barrier for symmetric
ﬁssion into a two-humped barrier [20,2]), their role in the case of metal clusters goes even
further. Indeed, as illustrated below (see section III.C.2) for the case of the magic Na2+
10 (8
delocalized electrons), shell eﬀects can be the largest contribution to the ﬁssion barrier, in
particular in instances when the LDM component exhibits no barrier (in this case the LDM
ﬁssility ξ > 1). In this respect, Na2+
10 is analogous to the case of superheavy nuclei, which
are believed [21] to be stabilized by the shell structure of a major shell closure at Zp = 114,
Nn = 184 (Zp is the number of protons and Nn is the number of neutrons; unfortunately
such nuclei have not been yet observed or synthesized artiﬁcially).

B. Other decay modes in atomic and molecular clusters

In this chapter, we will concentrate on the unimolecular processes in metal clusters
described by Eqs. (1
3). However, there is a variety of additional dissociation and frag-
mentation modes in atomic and molecular clusters (see reviews in Ref. [22]), which have
been discovered experimentally or anticipated theoretically; among them we mention:

−

1. Unimolecular ﬁssion of triply and higher charged cationic simple metal clusters

[6,23,24];

2. Metastability against electron autodetachment of multiply charged anionic atomic

clusters [25–27] and fullerenes [26–28];

3

3. Fragmentation of cationic fullerenes via sequential evaporation of carbon dimers [29];

4. Ultrarapid fragmentation of rare-gas clusters following excitation (involving excimer

formation [30]) or ionization [22];

5. Multifragmentation phase transitions according to microcanonical thermodynamics

of highly excited atomic clusters [31]; and

6. Pathways and dynamics of dissociation and fragmentation of ionized Van-der-Waals

and hydrogen-bonded molecular clusters [22,32].

C. Organization of the chapter

In the following, we will present jellium-related theoretical approaches [speciﬁcally the
Shell Correction Method (SCM) and variants thereof] appropriate for describing shell ef-
fects, energetics and decay pathways of metal-cluster fragmentation processes (both the
monomer/dimer dissociation and ﬁssion), which were inspired by the many similarities
with the physics of shell eﬀects in atomic nuclei (section II). In section III, we will compare
the experimental trends with the resulting theoretical SCM interpretations, and in addi-
tion we will discuss theoretical results from ﬁrst-principles MD simulations (section III.C.1).
Section IV will discuss some latest insights concerning the importance of electronic-entropy
and ﬁnite-temperature eﬀects. Finally, section V will provide a summary.

II. THEORY OF SHAPE DEFORMATIONS

In early applications of the jellium model, the shape of metal clusters was assumed in all
instances to be spherical [33,34], but soon it became apparent that the spherical symmetry
was too restrictive [35,36]. Indeed clusters with open electronic shells (between the magic
numbers Ne = 2, 8, 20, 40, 58, 92, etc...) are subjected to Jahn-Teller distortions [37].
By now it has been well established that a quantitative description of the underlying shell
eﬀects and of fragmentation phenomena (as well as of other less complicated phenomena
such as Ionization and Vertical Electron Detachment) requires a proper description of the
deformed shapes of both parent and daughter clusters (of both precursor and ﬁnal ionic or
neutral product in the case of ionization and vertical electron detachment).

A most successful method for describing both deformation and shell eﬀects in simple
metal clusters (i.e., those that can be described by the jellium background model) is the
SCM, originally developed in the ﬁeld of nuclear physics [38,2]. In a series of recent publica-
tions [25,26,28,39–45], the SCM was further developed, adapted, and applied in the realm
of ﬁnite-size, condensed-matter nanostructures (i.e., metal clusters [25,26,39–43], but also
multiply charged fullerenes [28], 3He clusters [44], and metallic nanowires and nanoconstric-
tions [45]). Additionally, Refs. [46–49] have used semiempirical versions (see below) of the
SCM to study the shapes of neutral Na clusters [46,47] and aspects of metal-cluster ﬁssion
[48,49].

The SCM derives its justiﬁcation from the local-density-approximation (LDA) functional

theory and has been developed as a two-level method.

4

At the microscopic level, referred to as the LDA-SCM, the method has been shown to
be a non-selfconsistent approximation to the Kohn-Sham (KS)
LDA approach [50]. Apart
from computational eﬃciency, an important physical insight provided by the LDA-SCM is
that the total KS-LDA energy Etotal(N) [or in another notation EKS(N)] of a ﬁnite system
of interacting delocalized electrons (or more generally of other fermions, like nucleons or
3He atoms) can be divided into two contributions, i.e.,

−

Etotal(N) =

E(N) + ∆Esh(N) ,

(4)

E is the part that varies smoothly as a function of the system size (e.g., the num-
where
ber, N of atoms in a metal cluster), while ∆Esh(N) is an oscillatory term accounting for
the shell eﬀects; it arises from the discretization of the electronic states (quantum size ef-
fect). ∆Esh(N) is usually called a shell correction in the nuclear [38,1] and cluster [25,26]
literature.

e

e

Starting from the fundamental microscopic separation in Eq. (4), various semiempirical
implementations (referred to as SE-SCM, see section II.B) of such a division consist of
diﬀerent approximate choices and methods for evaluating the two terms contributing to
this separation.

As an illustration of the physical content of Eq. (4) (which as well serves as a motivating
example for the SCM), we show in Fig. 1 the size-evolutionary pattern of the Ionization Po-
tentials (IPs) of NaN clusters, which exhibits odd-even oscillations in the observed spectrum
in addition to the major features (major IP drops) at the magic numbers. Theoretical cal-
culations at three diﬀerent levels are contrasted to the experimental observations, namely,
a smooth description of the pattern [Inset (a)], and two levels of shell-corrected descriptions
— one assuming spherical symmetry [Inset (b)], and the other allowing for triaxial shape
deformations [Fig. 1, main frame]. The progressive improvement of the level of agreement
between the experimental [51,52] and theoretical patterns is evident.

Below, we ﬁrst outline the microscopic derivation of Eq. (4), and subsequently we pro-

ceed with a presentation of the SE-SCM.

A. Microscopic Foundation of Shell Correction Methods – The LDA-SCM

The LDA-SCM approach, which has been shown to yield results in excellent agreement
with self-consistent KS-LDA calculations [25,26], is equivalent to a Harris functional [53]
approximation (EHarris[ρin], see below) to the KS-LDA total energy [50] (EKS[ρKS]), with the
input density ρin obtained through a variational minimization of an extended Thomas-Fermi
(ETF) energy functional, EETF[ρ].

The property of the non-selfconsistent Harris functional to yield total energies close to

the KS-LDA ones is based on the following equality:

EKS[ρKS] = EHarris[ρin] + O(δρ2) ,

(5)

ρin. Namely, the KS-LDA energy is, to second-order in δρ, equal to the

where δρ = ρKS
Harris energy.

Several recent publications have proven [54–56] the validity of equation (5) in connec-
tion with the Harris functional, which is often used in electronic structure calculations of

molecules, surfaces, and other condensed-matter systems. We note that, in the context
of nuclear physics, Strutinsky had earlier proven [38] the validity of Eq. (5), with the dif-
ference that he utilized the Hartree-Fock (HF) functional instead of the KS-LDA one. In
the nuclear-physics literature, the HF version of Eq. (5) is referred to as the Strutinsky
theorem.

Usually, in the Harris functional, the input density ρin is taken as a superposition of
site densities. Initially [53], the site components of the input density were not optimized.
Later [55,56], it was realized that the results could be improved by variationally adjusting
the site components through a maximization of the Harris functional itself. However, doing
so adds the burden of a matrix diagonalization for obtaining the eigenvalues (see below)
at each step of the variation. Our method diﬀers from the Harris approach in that the
optimization of the input density is achieved by us through a variational ETF method [57]
(which does not require such a step-by-step matrix diagonalization).

1. Methodology

Rather than proceed with the microscopic route, Strutinsky proposed a method for the
separation of the total energy into smooth and shell-correction terms [see Eq. (4)] based on
Esp, is extracted out of the sum of
an averaging procedure. Accordingly, a smooth part,

In applications of Eq. (16), the single-particle energies involved in the averaging [see
Eqs. (13) and (14)] are commonly obtained as solutions of a Schr¨odinger equation with
phenomenological one-body potentials. This last approximation has been very successful
in describing ﬁssion barriers and properties of strongly deformed nuclei using harmonic-
oscillator-type or Wood-Saxon empirical potentials.

2. Liquid-drop model for neutral and charged deformed clusters

For neutral clusters, the LDM expresses [60,48,5] the smooth part,

E, of the total energy
as the sum of three contributions, namely a volume, a surface, and a curvature term, i.e.,

where dτ is the volume element and dS is the surface diﬀerential element. The local
curvature κ is deﬁned by the expression κ = 0.5(R−1
min), where Rmax and Rmin are
the two principal radii of curvature at a local point on the surface of the jellium droplet (of a
general shape) which models the cluster. The corresponding coeﬃcients can be determined
[25,26,60] by ﬁtting the ETF-LDA total energy for spherical shapes (see section II.A) to the
following parametrized expression as a function of the number, N, of atoms in the cluster
[61],

max + R−1

Esph

ETF = αvN + αsN 2/3 + αcN 1/3 .

The following expressions relate [62] the coeﬃcients Av, σ, and Ac to the corresponding

In the following, we will focus on the case of clusters with ellipsoidal (triaxial) shapes.
In the case of ellipsoidal shapes the areal integral and the integrated curvature can be
(ψ, k)
expressed in closed analytical form with the help of the incomplete elliptic integrals
(ψ, k) of the ﬁrst and second kind [63], respectively. Before writing the formulas, we

need to introduce some notations. Volume conservation must be employed, namely

where R0 is the radius of a sphere with the same volume (R0 = rsN 1/3 is taken to be
the radius of the positive jellium assuming spherical symmetry, rs being the corresponding
Wigner-Seitz radius), and a = a′/R0, etc..., are the dimensionless semi-axes. The eccen-
tricities are deﬁned through the dimensionless semi-axes as follows

The semi-axes are chosen so that

3. The modiﬁed Nilsson potential for ellipsoidal shapes

A natural choice for an external potential to be used for calculating shell corrections
with the Strutinsky method is an anisotropic, three-dimensional oscillator with an addi-
tional l2 angular-momentum term for lifting the harmonic oscillator degeneracies [65]. Such
an oscillator model for approximating the total energies of metal clusters, but without sepa-
rating them into a smooth and a shell-correction part in the spirit of Strutinsky’ s approach,
had been used [52] with some success for calculating relative energy surfaces and deforma-
tion shapes of metal clusters. However, this simple harmonic oscillator model had serious
limitations, since i) the total energies were calculated by the expression 3
ǫi, and thus
4
did not compare with the total energies obtained from the KS-LDA approach, and ii) the
model could not be extended to the case of charged (cationic or anionic) clusters. Thus
absolute ionization potentials, electron aﬃnities, and ﬁssion energetics could not be calcu-
lated in this model. Alternatively, in our approach, we are making only a limited use of
the external oscillator potential in calculating a modiﬁed Strutinsky shell correction. Total
energies are evaluated by adding this shell correction to the smooth LDM energies (which
incorporate xc contributions, since the LDM coeﬃcients are extracted via a comparison
with total ETF-LDA energies, or they are taken from experimental values).

In particular, a modiﬁed Nilsson Hamiltonian appropriate for metal clusters [35,36] is

U0 in Eq. (27) is a dimensionless parameter, which for occupied states may depend on
the eﬀective principal quantum number n = n1 + n2 + n3 associated with the major shells
of any spherical-oscillator, (n1, n2, n3) being the quantum numbers specifying the single-
particle levels of the hamiltonian H0 (for clusters comprising up to 100 valence electrons,
only a weak dependence on n is found, see Table I in Ref. [40a]). U0 vanishes for values of
n higher than the corresponding value of the last partially (or fully) ﬁlled major shell with
reference to the spherical limit.

k is a ”stretched” angular momentum which scales to the ellipsoidal shape

The stretched l2 is not a properly deﬁned angular-momentum operator, but has the
advantageous property that it does not mix deformed states which correspond to sherical
major shells with diﬀerent principal quantum numbers n = n1 + n2 + n3 (see, the Appendix
in Ref. [40a] for the expression of the matrix elements of l2).

The subtraction of the term < l2 >n= n(n + 3)/2, where < >n denotes the expectation
value taken over the nth-major shell in spherical symmetry, guaranties that the average
separation between major oscillator shells is not aﬀected as a result of the lifting of the
degeneracy.

The oscillator frequencies can be related to the principal semi-axes a′, b′, and c′ [see,
Eq. (20)] via the volume-conservation constraint and the requirement that the surface of
the cluster is an equipotential one, namely

4. Shell correction and averaging of single-particle spectra for the modiﬁed Nilsson potential

Usually

Esp [see Eqs. (13) and (14)] is calculated numerically [66]. However, a variation
of the numerical Strutinsky averaging method consists in using the semiclassical parti-
tion function and in expanding it in powers of ¯h2. With this method, for the case of an
anisotropic, fully triaxial oscillator, one ﬁnds [1,67] an analytical result, namely [68]

E (available

6. Asymmetric two-center oscillator model for ﬁssion

Naturally, the one-center Nilsson oscillator is not the most appropriate empirical po-
tential for describing binary ﬁssion, which involves the gradual emergence of two separate
fragments. A better choice is the asymmetric two-center oscillator model (ATCOM). Ac-
cording to the ATCOM approach, the single-particle levels, associated with both the initial
one-fragment parent and the separated daughters emerging from binary cluster ﬁssion, are
determined by the following single-particle hamiltonian [69,70],

H = T +

where i = 1 for z < 0 (left) and i = 2 for z > 0 (right).

This hamiltonian is axially symmetric along the z axis. ρ denotes the cylindrical coor-
dinate perpendicular to the symmetry axis [71]. The shapes described by this Hamiltonian
are those of two semispheroids (either prolate or oblate) connected by a smooth neck [which
is speciﬁed by the term Vneck(z)]. z1 < 0 and z2 > 0 are the centers of these semispheroids.
For the smooth neck, the following 4th-order expression [70] was adopted, namely

The frequency ωρi in Eq. (36) must be z-dependent in order to interpolate smoothly
between the values ω◦
ρi of the lateral frequencies associated with the left (i = 1) and right
(i = 2) semispheroids, which are not equal in asymmetric cases. The frequencies ω◦
ρi (i =
1, 2) characterize the latteral harmonic potentials associated with the two semispheroids
outside the neck region. In the implementation of such an interpolation, we folllow Ref.
[70].

The angular-momentum dependent term U(l2

i ), where l1 and l2 are pseudoangular mo-
menta with respect to the left and right centers z1 and z2, is a direct generalization of the
corresponding term familiar from the one-center Nilsson potential (e.g., see Ref. [40a]). Its
function is to lift the usual harmonic-oscillator degeneracies for diﬀerent angular momenta,
2s degeneracy is properly lifted into a 1d shell that is
that is, for a spherical shape the 1d
lower than the 2s shell (for the parameters entering into this term, which ensure a proper
transition from the case of the ﬁssioning cluster to that of the separated two fragments, we
have followed Ref. [70]).

−

The cluster shapes associated with the spatial-coordinate-dependent single-particle po-
tential V (ρ, z) in the hamiltonian (36) (i.e., the second, thrid, and fourth terms) are deter-
mined by the assumption that the cluster surface coincides with an equipotential surface of
value V0, namely, from the relation V (ρ, z) = V0. Subsequently, one solves for ρ and derives
the cluster shape ρ = ρ(z). For the proper value of V0, we take the one associated with a
spherical shape containing the same number of atoms, N, as the parent cluster, namely,
V0 = 1
s N −1/3 eV, R = rsN 1/3, and rs is the Wigner-Seitz
radius in atomic units (monovalent metals have been assumed). Volume conservation is
implemented by requiring that the volume enclosed by the ﬁssioning cluster surface (even
after separation) remains equal to 4πR3/3.

solutions in ρ are those of a two-dimensional oscillator, while in z they can be expressed
through the parabolic cylinder functions [72]. The matching conditions at z = 0 for the left

Finally, from the liquid-drop-model contributions, we retain the two most important
ones, namely the surface contribution and the Coulomb repulsion. To determine the sur-
face contribution, we calculate numerically the area of the surface of the ﬁssioning cluster
shape, ρ = ρ(z), and multiply it by a surface-tension coeﬃcient speciﬁed via an ETF-LDA
calculation for spherical jellia [25,39] (or even from experimental values). The Coulomb
repulsion is calculated numerically using the assumption of a classical conductor, namely
the excess 2 units of positive charge are assumed to be distributed over the surface of the
ﬁssioning cluster, and in addition each of the fragments carries one unit of charge upon sep-
aration (for a more elaborate application of the LDM to triaxially deformed ground states
of neutral and charged metal clusters described via a one-center shape parametrization, see
our discussion in section II.B.2 in connection with Eqs. (17-26) and Ref. [40]).

As a result, the total energy Etotal for a speciﬁc ﬁssion conﬁguration is given by

Etotal = ELDM + ∆EStr

sh = ES + EC + ∆EStr
sh ,

(41)

where ES and EC are the surface and Coulomb terms, respectively.

III. EXPERIMENTAL TRENDS AND THEORETICAL INTERPRETATION

In the following, we describe applications of the SE-SCM approach to systematic inves-
tigations of the eﬀects of shape deformations on the energetics of fragmentation processes
of metal clusters [26,40,41], and to studies of deformations and barriers in ﬁssion of charged
metal clusters [43]. We mention that, in addition, Strutinsky calculations using phenomeno-
logical potentials have been reported for the case of neutral sodium clusters assuming axial
symmetry in Refs. [46,47,74], and for the case of ﬁssion in Refs. [48,49].

of IPs and electron aﬃnities (see Fig. 1 and Ref. [40a]), i.e., that results obtained via
calculations restricted to spherical shapes compare rather poorly with the experiment, that
improvement is evident when spheroidal (axially symmetric) deformations are considered,
and that the agreement between theory and experiment becomes detailed when triaxiality
(i.e., ellipsoidal shapes) is taken into consideration. The feature of the appearance of strong
odd-even alternations for N = 12
15 together with a well-deﬁned quartet in the range
N = 16
19 is present in the experimental monomer separation energies of both potassium
and sodium clusters, and theoretically it can be accounted for only after the inclusion of
triaxial deformations.

We note that in the case of dimer separation energies (Fig. 3) the odd-even alternations
cancel out. Parents with closed shells or subshells correspond to maxima, while daughters
with closed shells or subshells are associated with minima (e.g., the triplets N = 9
11, or
N = 15

17).

We also include for comparison results obtained by KS-LDA calculations [77] for de-
formed NaN clusters restricted to spheroidal (axial) symmetry (Fig. 4, top panel). As
expected, except for very small clusters (N < 9), these results do not exhibit odd-even
oscillations. In addition, signiﬁcant discrepancies between the calculated and experimen-
tal results are evident, particularly pertaining to the amplitude of oscillations at shell and
subshell closures.

the last few years. LDA calculations for ﬁssion energetics have usually been restricted

N = 15 (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8), the biaxial and triaxial results are essentially identical, since no
fragment with more than nine electrons is involved. We note that the magic fragments K+

In both cases, the main diﬀerence from the spherical jellium is
a strong suppression of the local minima, indicating that the critical size for exothermic
ﬁssion is signiﬁcantly smaller than N = 100 (about N = 30), as indeed has been observed
experimentally for hot cationic alkali-metal clusters [79] (the spherical-jellium results clearly
are not compatible with the emergence of such experimental critical sizes in the size range
N

1. Molecular-dynamics studies of ﬁssion

Before discussing applications of the SE-SCM (and variants thereof) to the description
of cluster ﬁssion, we note that for atomic and molecular clusters microscopic descriptions of
energetics and dynamics of ﬁssion processes, based on modern electronic structure calcula-
tions in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations (where the classical trajectories of
the ions, moving on the concurrently calculated Born-Oppenheimer (BO) electronic poten-
tial energy surface, are obtained via integration of the Newtonian equations of motion), are
possible and have been performed [10,11] using the BO-local-spin-density(-LSD)-functional-
MD method [80]. Such calculations, using norm-conserving non-local pseudopotentials
and self-consistent solutions of the KS-LSD equations [10,11], applied to small sodium
[10] and potassium [11] clusters, revealed several important trends (Figs. 11

As discussed above (see section II.B), in the SE-SCM method we need to introduce
appropriate empirical potentials. As will become apparent from our results, one-center
potentials (like the one-center modiﬁed, anisotropic harmonic oscillator) are not adequate
for describing shell eﬀects in the ﬁssion of small metal clusters; rather, a two-center potential
is required. Indeed, the empirical potentials should be able to simulate the fragmentation
of the initial parent cluster towards a variety of asymptotic daughter-cluster shapes, e.g.,
two spheres in the case of double magic fragments, a sphere and a spheroid in the case of a
single magic fragment, or two spheroids in a more general case. In the case of metal clusters,
asymmetric channels are most common, and thus a meaningful and ﬂexible description of
the asymmetry is of primary concern. We found [43] that such a required degree of ﬂexibility
can be provided via the shape parametrization of the asymmetric two-center-oscillator shell
model (ATCOSM) introduced earlier in nuclear ﬁssion [69] (see section II.B.6).

In addition to the present shape parametrization [43], other two-center shape
parametrizations [mainly in connection with KS-LDA jellium calculations] have been used
[81–83] in studies of metal cluster ﬁssion. They can be grouped into two categories, namely,
the two-intersected-spheres jellium [81,84], and the variable-necking-in parametrizations
[82,83]. In the latter group, Ref. [82] accounts for various necking-in situations by using

the ”funny-hills” parametrization [85], while Ref. [83] describes the necking-in by con-
necting two spheres smoothly through a quadratic surface. The limitation of these other
parametrizations is that they are not ﬂexible enough to account for the majority of the
eﬀects generated by the shell structure of the parent and daughters, which in general do
not have spherical, but deformed (independently from each other), shapes. An example is
oﬀered by the case of the parent Na2+
18 , which has a metastable oblate ground state, and
thus cannot be described by any one of the above parametrizations. We wish to emphasize
again that one of the conclusions of the present work is that the shell structures of the
(independently deformed) parent and daughters are the dominant factors specifying the
ﬁssion barriers, and thus parametrizations [81–83] with restricted ﬁnal fragment (or par-
ent) shapes are deﬁcient in accounting for some of the most important features governing
metal-cluster ﬁssion.

As a demonstration of our method, we present results for two diﬀerent parents, namely
10 and Na2+

Fig. 14 presents results for the channel Na2+

3 for three diﬀerent cases,
namely, when the larger fragment Na+
7 is oblate (left column), spherical (middle column),
and prolate (right column). From our one-center analysis, we ﬁnd as expected that Na+
7
(with six electrons) has an oblate global minimum and a higher in energy prolate local
minimum. In the two-center analysis, we have calculated the ﬁssion pathways so that the
emerging fragments correspond to possible deformed one-center minima. It is apparent that
the most favored channel (i.e., having the lowest barrier, see the solid line in the bottom
panels) will yield an oblate Na+
7 (left column in Fig. 14), in agreement with the expectations
from the one-center energetics analysis.

The middle panels exhibit the decomposition of the total barrier into the three compo-
nents of surface, Coulomb, and shell-correction terms [see Eq. (41)], which are denoted by
an upper dashed curve, a lower dashed curve, and a solid line, respectively. The total LDM
contribution (surface plus Coulomb) is also exhibited at the bottom panels (dashed lines).
It can be seen that the LDM barrier is either absent or very small, and that the total
barrier is due almost exclusively to electronic shell eﬀects. The total barrier has a double-
humped structure, with the outer hump corresponding to the LDM saddle point, which
also happens to be the scission point (indicated by an empty vertical arrow). The inner
hump coincides with the peak of the shell-eﬀect term, and is associated with the rearrange-
ment of single-particle levels from the initial spherical parent to a molecular conﬁguration
resembling a Na+
3 . Such molecular conﬁgurations (discovered earlier
in ﬁrst-principles MD simulations [10,11] of ﬁssion of charged metal clusters, as well as
in studies of fusion of neutral clusters [86]) are a natural precursor towards full fragment
separation and complete ﬁssion, and naturally they give rise to the notion of preformation
of the emerging fragments [10,11].

for small clusters, this is the only case where a channel other than that of the trimer is
the most favored one). The top panel of Fig. 15(a) describes the evolution of the single-
particle spectra. The spherical ordering 1s, 1p, 1d, 2s, etc., for the parent at d = 0 is
clearly discernible. With increasing separation distance, the levels exhibit several crossings,
and, after the scission point, they naturally regroup to a new ordering associated with the
spherical Na+
9 products (at the end of the ﬁssion process, the levels are doubly degenerate
compared to the initial conﬁguration, since there are two Na+
9 fragments). It is seen that
the ATCOSM leads to an oscillator energy (i.e., the gap between two populated major shells
exhibited at the right end of the ﬁgure) of 1.47 eV for each Na+

From the middle panel of Fig. 15(a), we observe that the shell-correction (solid line)
contributes a net gain in energy of about 1.6 eV upon dissociation into two Na+
9 fragments.
This gain is larger than the increase in energy (i.e., positive energy change) due to the surface
term, which saturates at a value of about 1 eV after the scission point at d
23 a.u. The
total energy is displayed in the bottom panel of Fig. 15(a) (solid line) along with the LDM
barrier (dashed line). Even though distorted (when compared to the cases of Fig. 14), the
total barrier still exhibits a two-peak structure, the inner peak arising from the hump in the
shell correction, and the outer peak arising from the point of saturation of the surface term
(this last point coincides again with the scission point, as well as with the saddle of the LDM
barrier). An inner local minimum is located at d
8 a.u., and corresponds to a compact
prolate shape of the parent [see second drawing from the left at the top of Fig. 15(a)], while a
second deeper minimum appears at d
18 a.u., corresponding to a superdeformed shape of
a molecular conﬁguration of two Na+
9 clusters tied up together [preformation of fragments,
see third drawing from the left at the top of Fig. 15(a)]. The inner barrier separating
the compact prolate conﬁguration from the superdeformed molecular conﬁguration arises
from the rearrangement of the single-particle levels during the transition from the initially
assumed spherical Na2+

that the barrier separating the molecular conﬁguration from complete ﬁssion is very weak

The top dotted line at the bottom panel displays the total energy in the case when the

Na16. Overall,
two neutral Na8 clusters, namely the total energy for the reaction 2Na8
we ﬁnd good agreement with a KS-LDA calculation for this fusion process (see Fig. 1 of
Ref. [86]). We further note that the superdeformed minimum for the neutral Na16 cluster
is deeper than that in the case of the doubly charged Na2+
18 cluster. Naturally, this is due
to the absence of the Coulomb term.

The natural way for producing experimentally the metastable Na2+

18 cluster is by ioniza-
tion of the stable singly-charged Na+
18 cluster. Since this latter cluster contains seventeen
electrons and has a deformed oblate ground state [40a], it is not likely that the initial con-
ﬁguration of Na2+
18 will be spherical or prolate as was assumed for illustration purposes in
18 will be that of the oblate Na+
Fig. 15(a). Most likely, the initial conﬁguration for Na2+
18.
To study the eﬀect that such an oblate initial conﬁguration has on the ﬁssion barrier, we
display in Fig. 15(b) ATCOSM results for the pathway for the symmetric ﬁssion channel,
starting from an oblate shape of Na2+
18 , proceeding to a compact prolate shape, and then
to full separation between the fragments via a superdeformed molecular conﬁguration. We

observe that additional potential humps (in the range 2 a.u.
the shape transition from the oblate to the compact prolate shape, do develop. Concerning
the total energies, the additional innermost humps result in the emergence of a signiﬁcant
ﬁssion barrier of about 0.52 eV for the favored symmetric channel [see d
5 a.u. in Fig.
15(b)].

From the above analysis, we conclude that considerations of the energy pathways lead-
ing from the parent to preformation conﬁgurations (i.e., the inner-barrier hump, or humps)
together with the subsequent separation processes are most important for proper elucida-
tion of the mechanisms of metal-cluster ﬁssion processes. This corroborates earlier results
obtained via ﬁrst-principles MD simulations [10,11] pertaining to the energetics and dynam-
ical evolution of ﬁssion processes, and emphasizes that focusing exclusively [81,83] on the
separation process between the preformed state and the ultimate ﬁssion products provides
a rather incomplete description of ﬁssion phenomena in metal clusters. It is anticipated
that, with the use of emerging fast spectroscopies [87], experimental probing of the detailed
dynamics of such ﬁssion processes could be achieved.

IV. INFLUENCE OF ELECTRONIC ENTROPY ON SHELL EFFECTS

In the previous sections, we showed that consideration of triaxial (ellipsoidal) shapes in
the framework of the SCM leads to overall substantial systematic improvement in the agree-
ment between theory and experimental observations pertaining to the major and the ﬁne
structure of the size-evolutionary patterns associated with the energetics of fragmentation
processes (monomer/dimer dissociation energies and ﬁssion energetics) and ionization.

The theoretical methods and discussion of deformation eﬀects in the previous sections
were restricted to zero temperature. However, the experiments are necessarily made with
clusters at ﬁnite temperatures, a fact that strongly motivates the development of ﬁnite-
temperature theoretical approaches.

by 0.07 eV, so that the theoretical curves at both temperatures refer to the same point at N = 10.

Due to the diﬃculty of the subject, to date only a few ﬁnite-temperature theoretical
studies of metal clusters have been performed. In this section, we discuss brieﬂy some of
the conclusions of a recent SCM study [41] regarding the importance of thermal eﬀects.

The main conclusion of Ref. [41] was that, in conjunction with deformation eﬀects,
electronic-entropy eﬀects in the size-evolutionary patterns of relatively small (as small as
20 atoms) simple-metal clusters become prominent already at moderate temperatures. At
smaller sizes, electronic-entropy eﬀects are less prominent, but they can still be discernible.
As an example, we present in Fig. 16 the monomer separation energies of K+
N clusters
for two temperatures (T = 10 K and T = 300 K), along with the available experimental
measurements [75] (open squares) in the size range N = 4
23. First notice that the
T = 10 K results are practically indistinguishable from the T = 0 K results presented in
Fig. 2. Compared to the T = 10 K results, the theoretical results at T = 300 K are in
better agreement with the experimental ones due to an attenuation of the amplitude of
the alternations (e.g., notice the favorable reduction in the size of the drops at N = 9, 15,
and 21). This amplitude attenuation, however, is moderate, and it is remarkable that the
T = 300 K SCM results in this size range preserve in detail the same relative pattern as the
T = 0 K ones (in particular, the well-deﬁned odd-even oscillations in the range N = 4
15
and the ascending quartet at N = 16

19 followed by a dip at N = 20).

As a further example, the theoretical IPs of KN clusters in the size range 3

102 for
three temperatures, T = 10 K, 300 K, and 500 K, are displayed in Fig. 17, and are compared
with the experimental measurements [36] (open squares; the experimental uncertainties are
0.06 eV for N
30 and 0.03 eV for N > 30). As was the case with our earlier T = 0
K results [40], the T = 10 K theoretical results exhibit the following two characteristics:
(i) Above N = 21, a pronounced ﬁne structure between major-shell closures which is not
present in the experimental measurements; (ii) Steps at the major-shell closures which are

much larger than the experimental ones, i.e., three-to-ﬁve times for N = 40, 58, and 92,
and two-to-three times for N = 8 and 20 [this needs to be contrasted to the experimental
IPs for cold NaN clusters, which are in overall good agreement with out T = 0 K SE-SCM
results regarding both characteristics (see Fig. 1)].

The agreement between theory and experiment is signiﬁcantly improved at T = 300
K. Indeed, in comparison with the lower-temperature calculations, the T = 300 K results
exhibit the following remarkable changes: (i) Above N = 21, the previously sharp ﬁne-
structure features are smeared out, and as a result, the theoretical curve follows closely
the mild modulations of the experimental proﬁle. In the size range N = 21
34, three
rounded, hump-like formations (ending to the right at the subshell closures at N = 26,
30, and 34) survive in very good agreement with the experiment (the sizes of the drops at
N = 26, 30 and 34 are comparable to the experimental ones [88]); (ii) The sizes of the IP
drops at N = 20, 40, 58, and 92 are reduced drastically and are now comparable to the
experimental ones. In the size range N
20, the modiﬁcations are not as dramatic. Indeed,
one can clearly see that the pattern of odd-even alternations remains well deﬁned, but with
a moderate attenuation in amplitude, again in excellent agreement with the experimental
observation.

−

≤

For T = 500 K, the smearing out of the shell structure associated with the calculated
results progresses even further, obliterating the agreement between theory and experiment.
Speciﬁcally, the steps at the subshell closures at N = 26 and 30, as well as at the major-
shell closures at N = 40, 58, and 92 are rounded and smeared out over several clusters (an

31

analogous behavior has been observed in the logarithmic abundance spectra of hot, singly
cationic, copper, silver, and gold clusters [89]). At the same time, however, the odd-even
alternation remains well deﬁned for N
8. We further notice that, while some residue
of ﬁne structure survives in the range N = 9
15, the odd-even alternations there are
essentially absent (certain experimental measurements [90] of the IPs of hot NaN clusters
appear to conform to this trend).

≤

The inﬂuence of the electronic entropy on the height of ﬁssion barriers has not been
studied as yet, but it will undoubtedly be the subject of future research in metal-cluster
physics. In any case, based on the results of this section, it is natural to conjecture that
electronic-entropy eﬀects will tend to quench the barrier heights, especially in the case of
larger multiply charged clusters.

V. SUMMARY

In this chapter, we have elucidated certain issues pertaining to evaporation and ﬁssion
processes of metallic clusters, focusing on electronic shell eﬀects and their importance in
determining the energetics, structure, pathways, and dynamical mechanisms of dissociation
and fragmentation in these systems, and have outlined and demonstrated various theoretical
approaches currently used in investigations of cluster fragmentation phenomena, ranging
from microscopic ﬁrst-principles electronic structure calculations coupled with molecular
dynamics simulations to adaptation of more phenomenological in nature models originated
in studies of atomic nuclei. In this respect, a recurrent theme in this exposition has been
the crucial importance of deformation and electronic-entropy (temperature) eﬀects, as well
as their treatment with the help of shell correction methods.

By drawing analogies, as well as diﬀerences, between certain aspects of nuclear ﬁssion
and nuclear radioactivity phenomena and atomic (metallic) cluster ﬁssion processes, we
have attempted to provide a unifying conceptual framework for discussion of the physi-
cal principles underlying modes of cluster ﬁssion (i.e., importance of deformations, shell
eﬀects originating from fragments and parent, asymmetric and symmetric ﬁssion, single
and double-humped barriers, ﬁssioning cluster shapes, and dynamical aspects, such as the
time-scale of ﬁssion processes, kinetic energy release, and dynamical energy redistribution
among the ﬁssion products).

We conclude by commenting on some experimental and theoretical issues in cluster
ﬁssion which remain as future challenges (limiting ourselves to metallic clusters). These
include: ﬁssion dynamics of multiply charged large metal clusters [6,23,24]; systematic in-
vestigations of temperature eﬀects on modes of cluster ﬁssion, and ternary, and higher
multi-fragmentation processes; time-resolved spectroscopy of ﬁssion processes and of ﬁssion
isomers; spin eﬀects in ﬁssion; tunneling processes and corresponding life-times in sub-
barrier ﬁssion modes of clusters of light elements, e.g., lithium; and ﬁssion processes of
non-simple metal clusters.

[57] The choice of the ETF energy functional as a vehicle for optimization of the input den-
sity is a rather natural one. Indeed, in several attempts (((such as the integral formulation
of density functional theory [W. Yang, Phys. Rev. A 38, 5494 (1988)], or through the
use of generalized nonlocal kinetic-energy functionals [L.-W. Wang and M. P. Teter,
Phys. Rev. B 45, 13 196 (1992)]))) to construct theories based on the Hohenberg-Kohn
density functional theorem [P. Hohenberg and W. Kohn, Phys. Rev. 136, B684 (1964)]
directly, that is without the use of orbitals, the ETF functional [see Wang et al. above]
(with the kinetic functional expanded in density gradients), or the TF density [see,
Yang above] appear as a limiting case, or lowest level of approximation, respectively.

[58] Here we use the Gunnarsson-Lundqvist xc functional [see O. Gunnarsson and B. I.

Lundqvist, Phys. Rev. B 13, 4274 (1976)].

[61] Here, we consider clusters of monovalent elements (Na, K, Cu, etc.). For polyvalent

elements, N in Eq. (18) must be replaced by Nv, where v is the valency.

[62] For materials with high electronic densities, it is known that the usual LDA fails to
provide adequate values for the surface tension. Therefore, in Ref. [40] (see also Ref.
[28] for the case of fullerenes), in the case of Cu and Li clusters, we have carried an
ETF calculation using the stabilized-jellium-LDA (SJ-LDA) functional, which yields
substantially improved values for the surface tension. It is also well known that both
the simple-jellium LDA and the stabilized-jellium LDA in the case of plane-surface
calculations yield only approximate values for the Work Function. In our method,
we can easily overcome these LDA discrepancies by taking the Work Function and the
surface tension from experimental observations. This latter procedure has the additional
advantage that contributions from the atomic d electrons in the case of noble-metal
clusters (i.e., Ag, Au, Cu) are automatically included in the SE-SCM (see Refs. [41,42]).

[85] In this three-variables parametrization, the B parameter controls the necking-in, the C
parameter controls the distance, and the α parameter controls the asymmetry, leaving
no freedom for the shapes of the parent or the emerging fragments to be varied. In
particular, both fragments remain simultaneously either prolatelike or oblatelike, while
ﬁnal spherical shapes are excluded altogether. The weaknesses of the ”funny hills”
parametrization with respect to metal-cluster ﬁssion have been discussed in Ref. [24].

Abstract. We present results on the scattering lengths of 4He–4He2 and
3He–4He2 collisions. We also study the consequence of varying the coupling
constant of the atom-atom interaction.

1 Introduction

The two-body scattering length in a dilute gas of alkali atoms can be varied by
changing the external magnetic ﬁeld close to a Feshbach resonance [1]. In this
way one may force the two-body s-wave scattering length to go from positive
to negative values through inﬁnity. Therefore, the magnetic ﬁeld should be an
appropriate tool in modeling the Eﬁmov eﬀect. We recall that this eﬀect occurs
in case of inﬁnite two-body scattering lengths, manifesting itself in an inﬁnite
number of three-body bound states.

This role of the magnetic ﬁeld combined with a Feshbach resonance may be
mimicked by varying the coupling constant of the two-body interaction within
a three-body system that is not necessarily subject to a magnetic ﬁeld [2]. In
this context the system of three 4He atoms appears to be the best candidate.
Actually, it has been shown that the excited state of the 4He trimer is already
of Eﬁmov nature. To get the complete Eﬁmov eﬀect it suﬃces to weaken the
He–He interatomic potential only by about 3%.

In the present work we extend the investigation of the three-atomic helium
systems undertaken in [3], which was based on a mathematically rigorous hard-
core version of the Faddeev diﬀerential equations. We calculate the scattering

Scattering Length for Helium Atom-Diatom Collision

lengths for 3;4He atoms - 4He dimer collisions. Under the assumption that weak-
ening the potential mimics the behaviour of the scattering length in a magnetic
ﬁeld, we show the dependence of low-energy three-body scattering properties on
the two-body scattering length.

Some of the results presented in this paper were reported already in [4] and [5].

2 Results

In our calculations we employed the hard-core version of the Faddeev diﬀerential
equations developed in [3]. As He-He interaction we used the semi-empirical
HFD-B [6] and LM2M2 [7] potentials by Aziz and co-workers, and the more
recent, purely theoretically derived TTY [8] potential by Tang, Toennies and Yiu.
For the explicit form of these polarization potentials we refer to the Appendix
of Ref. [3]. As in our previous calculations we choose ~2/m4He
= 12.12 K ˚A2 and
stand for the masses of the 3He and
m3He
and m4He
4He atoms, respectively. The 4He dimer binding energies and 4He–4He scattering
lengths obtained with the HFD-B, LM2M2, and TTY potentials are shown in
Table 1. Note that the inverse of the wave number κ(2) = p|ǫd| lies rather close
to the corresponding scattering length.

increasing the values of the grid parameters and cutoﬀ hyperradius. The cor-
responding results are presented in Table 2. This table also contains the fairly
recent results by Blume and Greene [10] and by Roudnev [11]. The treatment of
[10] is based on a combination of the Monte Carlo method and the hyperspherical
adiabatic approach. The one of Ref. [11] employs the three-dimensional Faddeev
diﬀerential equations in the total angular momentum representation. Our results
agree rather well with these alternative calculations.

For completeness we mention that besides the above ab initio calculations
there are also model calculations, the results of which are given in the last two
columns of Table 2. The calculations of [12] are based on employing a Yamaguchi
potential that leads to an easily solvable one-dimensional integral equation in mo-
mentum space. The approach of [13] represents intrinsically a zero-range model
with a cut-oﬀ introduced to make the resulting one-dimensional Skornyakov-
Ter-Martirosian equation [14] well deﬁned. The cut-oﬀ parameter in [13] as well
as the range parameter of the Yamaguchi potential in [12] are adjusted to the
three-body binding energy obtained in the ab initio calculations. In other words,
these approaches are characterized by remarkable simplicity, but rely essentially
on results of the ab initio three-body calculations.

Due to the smaller mass of the 3He atom, the 3He – 4He system is unbound.
Nevertheless, the 3He4He2 trimer exists, though with a binding energy of about
14 mK (see [5] and references therein). And, in contrast to the symmetric case,
there is no excited (Eﬁmov-type) state in the asymmetric 3He4He2 system. Ta-

ble 3 contains our results for the 3He–4He2 scattering length.

Following the idea that weakening the potential could imitate the action
of a magnetic ﬁeld on the scattering length, we multiply the original potential
VHFD−B(x) by a factor λ. Decreasing this coupling constant, there emerges a
virtual state of energy Evirt on the second energy sheet. This energy, relative to
the two-body binding energy ǫd, is given in column 4 of Table 4. When decreasing
λ further, this state turns into the second excited state. Its energy E(2)
ex relative
to ǫd is shown in the next column. These energy results are in a good agreement
with the literature [16]. When the second excited state emerges, the 4He–4He2
scattering length ℓ(1+2)
changes its sign going through a pole, while the two-body
scattering length ℓ(1+1)
increases monotonically.

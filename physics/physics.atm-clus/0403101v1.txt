We present studies of the potential energy landscape of selected binary Lennard-Jones thirteen
atom clusters. The eﬀect of adding selected impurity atoms to a homogeneous cluster is explored.
We analyze the energy landscapes of the studied systems using disconnectivity graphs. The required
inherent structures and transition states for the construction of disconnectivity graphs are found by
combination of conjugate gradient and eigenvector-following methods. We show that it is possible
to controllably induce new structures as well as reorder and stabilize existing structures that are
characteristic of higher-lying minima. Moreover, it is shown that the selected structures can have
experimentally relevant lifetimes.

INTRODUCTION

The science of chemistry is characterized by an inter-
play of reductionist and constructionist themes. On the
one hand, one seeks to reduce complex systems to more
understandable and more controllable components. On
the other, one strives to utilize these components to con-
struct complex assemblies to meet speciﬁc chemical, bi-
ological, and/or materials goals. The core elements of
such eﬀorts have, in the past, been largely atomic and/or
molecular in nature.

Viewed from the above perspective, a central compo-
nent of much ongoing research has been the develop-
ment of a variety of “reductionist” classical and quantum-
mechanical tools. Common goals in the application of
these tools have been locating the minimum energy con-
ﬁguration for the associated potential energy surface1
and sampling the relevant, low-lying local minima.2,3,4,5
Increasingly, both chemistry and materials science are
entering an era in which the fundamental components of
the constructionist phase of the problem often are them-
selves complex, preassembled objects. Sun, et al.,6 for ex-
ample, have shown that novel magnetic materials can be
prepared through the self-assembly of colloidal clusters.
In related developments Lehmann and Scoles7 as well
as Miller, et al.8,9,10 have demonstrated the eﬀectiveness
of superﬂuid solvents in preparing unusual, metastable
species. Sustained progress in this emerging ﬁeld of clus-
ter assembled materials ultimately rests on the ability
to characterize and control a broad range of increasingly
complex nanoscale objects.

In a previous paper11, we have examined a number
of theoretical issues of general concern with respect to
predicting/characterizing/controlling the structure and

in
dynamics of cluster-based precursors. That work,
essence, seeks to invert the logic of the minimization
problem. That is,
instead of searching for the mini-
mum energy structures of speciﬁed energy landscapes, we
strive instead to reshape those landscapes and thereby to
exercise control over selected physical systems. In par-
ticular, we seek to stabilize and/or kinetically trap con-
formers of the parent homogeneous system that are oth-
erwise either un- or metastable. Our hope is that such
new structures might have interesting physical proper-
ties (electronic, magnetic, optical, thermal, etc.) and
can be used as precursors in subsequent assembly pro-
cedures. Our previous work11 has demonstrated that for
small Lennard-Jones systems we could, using selected im-
purities, both alter the energy ordering of the stable core
atom isomers and induce wholly new conformers not seen
in the original homogeneous species. We have also seen
similar reordering eﬀects in our studies of molecular ni-
trogen adsorbates on nickel clusters.12

In the present study, we wish to extend the results of
our previous investigations. First, we wish to consider a
number of larger clusters to demonstrate the general ap-
plicability of our eﬀorts. Second, we wish to demonstrate
the resulting species can be made suﬃciently robust that
they are of practical interest. To attain the second goal
we enhance our previous publication11 by determining
RRKM isomerization rate constants and lifetimes for the
generated isomers.

An important byproduct of the current work is the in-
formation we garner concerning the structure of the po-
tential energy surfaces of the mixed cluster systems. In
the current work we ﬁnd that many of the disconnectiv-
ity graphs have double-funnel structures. The thermo-
dynamic properties of other cluster systems with double-

funnel structures2,13 can be rich exhibiting solid-like to
solid-like phase change phenomena. Motivated by these
past studies and the disconnectivity graphs investigated
in the current work, in a companion paper14 we investi-
gate the energy and heat capacity of some of the systems
studied here.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
An outline of the computational details of this work is
presented in Sec II. We discuss the methods utilized to
ﬁnd the inherent structures and transition states on the
potential energy surface as well as the method to estimate
the inherent structures lifetimes. In Sec. III we present
the results that demonstrate “proof of principle” with
respect to the goals of the present studies. In Sec. IV we
summarize our results and speculate about likely future
research directions.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

In this section, we describe the computational de-
tails of the studies involving binary clusters of the form
X13−nYn. Our overall interest is to explore the extent to
which we can utilize the “adatoms” (i.e. the Y-system) to
induce, reorder and stabilize selected inherent structures
in the “core” X-system. While one can easily imagine
applications involving more and more complex compo-
nents, we have found that these relatively simple, two-
component clusters are a convenient starting point for
an initial study of the issues we raise.11

The total potential energy, Vtot, of a cluster consisting
of N particles is modeled as a pairwise sum of Lennard-
Jones interactions

Vtot =

vij (rij ),

(1)

N

X
i<j

where the pair interaction as a function of the distance
between particles i and j, rij , is given by

vij (rij ) = 4ǫij [(

σij
rij

)12

(

σij
rij

−

)6].

(2)

In Eq. (2) the constants ǫij and σij are the energy and
length-scale parameters for the interaction of particles i
and j.

For a binary system, both the “like” (X-X, Y-Y) as
well as the “unlike” (X-Y) interactions have to be spec-
iﬁed. With an eye toward studying trends in the results
as opposed to results for particular physical systems, it is
convenient to reduce the number of free parameters. To
do so, we shall assume in the present study that the “un-
like” Lennard-Jones values are obtained from the “like”
Lennard-Jones parameters via usual combination rules15

2

(4)

(5)

(6)

ǫXY = √ǫXX ǫY Y .

Furthermore, we note that with the mixed Lennard-Jones
parameters speciﬁed as in Eqs.(3) and (4), the inherent
structure topography of the “reduced” potential energy
surface of the binary system (i.e. Vtot/ǫXX ) is a function
of only two parameters, (σ, ǫ), the ratios of the corre-
sponding adatom/core length and energy parameters

σ = σY Y /σXX ,

ǫ = ǫY Y /ǫXX .

If necessary for a discussion of a speciﬁc physical sys-
tem, the absolute bond lengths, energies, activation en-
ergies, etc. can be obtained from the corresponding “re-
duced” results by a simple rescaling with the appropriate
core-system Lennard-Jones parameters.

A. Stationary points and the disconnectivity graph

The computational task in our study is thus one of ex-
ploring and characterizing the (reduced) potential energy
surface of our binary cluster systems as a function of the
number of (core, adatom) particles, (n, m), and for given
(σ, ǫ) ratios. In typical applications the lowest NIS inher-
ent structures and the associated disconnectivity graphs
are determined. For the applications reported here, NIS
is generally of the order of several thousands or more.
The inherent structures are found either via conjugate
gradient methods16 starting from randomly chosen ini-
tial conﬁgurations, or by more systematic surface explo-
ration methods.17,18 In all cases, the inherent structures
that are located are conﬁrmed to be stable minima via a
standard Hessian analysis. To reduce the chance we miss
particular local or global minima, we monitor the num-
ber of times individual inherent structures are found and
demand that each of the NIS inherent structures be lo-
cated a minimum number of times (at least 10) before we
terminate our search. Once we are satisﬁed we have lo-
cated the relevant inherent structures, transitions states
linking these stable minima are obtained using the eigen-
vector following methods outlined by Cerjan and Miller19
and further developed by Simons et al.20,21,22, Jordan et
al.18 and Wales23. Finally, with the given inherent struc-
tures and transition states, we perform a disconnectivity
analysis.24,25

B. Rate constants and lifetimes of the inherent
structures

σXY =

(σXX + σY Y ),

(3)

From the known inherent structures and the transition
states that connect/separate them, we estimate rates for

transitions between neighboring inherent structures. The
rate constants allow us to calculate the average amount of
time the system will spend in a given inherent structure,
i.e. the lifetime of an inherent structure.

There are variety of methods available to estimate
the rate constants (see Ref.26 and references therein).
We utilize the harmonic approximation to the Rice-
Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) method.
It has
been found that this method gives good estimates of rates
for isomerization of clusters27. The rate constant, kij , for
transition leading from inherent structure j to inherent
structure i is given as a sum over all transition states
connecting inherent structures i and j1,28

responding normal mode frequencies. N is the number
of particles in the cluster while hj and hα
j are the order
of the point group of inherent structure j and transi-
tion state α, respectively. Since we are interested in the
qualitative estimates of the rate constants (lifetimes) we
neglect the order of the point group of inherent struc-
ture and transition state from our calculations. We es-
timate that the error arising from this approximation is
a factor between 60 and 1 based on the reasoning that
follows: The global minimum of the systems we study
is icosahedral in nature which means that the order of
its point group is no larger than hj=60. The transition
state that connects the global minimum with a higher
lying inherent structure has a lower symmetry than the
global minimum and therefore smaller order of the point
group than the one associated with the point group of the
global minimum. As is made evident below, the factor
of 60 is unimportant to the determination of the order
of magnitude estimates of isomer lifetimes that are of
interest to us in the current context. We would like to
point out that the numerical value of ǫXX and σXX used
to calculate the rate constants are 119.8 K and 3.405 ˚A,
respectively.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In the present Section, we illustrate the general themes
we introduced in Section I . We demonstrate that we can
accomplish three basic objectives. Speciﬁcally, we show

3

that by adding selected “impurity” atoms to bare “core”
systems, we can:

1. induce new “core structures”
2. reorder the energies of existing core inherent struc-

tures, and

3. stabilize selected inherent structures by controlling
the activation energies that determine their isomerization
kinetics.

For purposes of illustration, we examine numerical re-
sults for three, thirteen atom Lennard-Jones systems in-
volving ten, eleven and twelve core atoms, systems well-
known from previous studies29 to have 64, 170 and 515
energetically distinct inherent structures, respectively.
These systems have been chosen because they build upon
simple ten, eleven and twelve-atom cores and because
total systems have thirteen atoms, a magic number for
icosahedral growth in homogeneous systems.

A. X12Y1

We ﬁrst consider binary clusters of the type X12Y1.
The selected inherent structures and their associated en-
ergies for X12 core system are illustrated in Fig. 1. The
inherent structure labeled by (a) is the global minimum
while all others are the higher lying inherent structures.
Here one impurity atom Y is added to the parent, twelve-
atom X core. Using the techniques of Section II, we de-
termine the lowest several inherent structures for a range
of (σ,ǫ) [c.f. Eq.(5) and Eq.(6)]. As can be seen from
Fig. 2, the total potential energy [Eq.(1)] of the lowest
inherent structure for the X12Y1 system shows no ap-
preciable structure as a function of the (σ,ǫ) parameters.

On the other hand, it can be seen in Fig. 3 that the core
potential energy, deﬁned as the potential energy of inter-
action for only the core X-atoms, of the minimum (total)
energy cluster clearly breaks into extended regions, each
corresponding to a well-deﬁned core structure. We would
like to point out that each region in Fig. 3 contains the
same “kind” of core structure but their core energies are
slightly diﬀerent. We have chosen a single “average” core
energy value to represent all energies in the correspond-
ing domain for plotting convenience.

The distinct core structures, shown in Fig. 3, have been
identiﬁed by examining their core energies (Ecore) and
their principal moments of inertia. For each structure
a triplet of values (Ecore, I2, I3) has been associated,
where I2 and I3 are the moments of inertia about the
principal axes 2 and 3, respectively. We have deﬁned I2
and I3 in the following way: I2=I
1,
3 are the principal moments of inertia obtained
2 and I
I
by diagonalizing the inertia tensor of the system. If the
triplet of values has not been suﬃcient to identify a core
structure then we have examined the structure visually.
Selected cluster structures illustrating the core ar-
rangements corresponding to various (σ,ǫ) values are
shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen from Figs. 3 and 4 that

FIG. 3: Ecore(σ, ǫ) for the X12Y1 system. Here the “core” en-
ergy is deﬁned as that portion of the potential energy arising
from only the core-core atom interactions. Unlike the total
energy, the (σ, ǫ) variation of the core cluster energy exhibits
relatively well-deﬁned regions. The labels of each of these re-
gions in the ﬁgure correspond to the distinct core structures
shown in Fig. 4.

the X12Y1 cluster exhibits core X-atom structures that
are higher lying minima in the parent X12 system. The
core structures labeled by (4.2), (4.3), (4.4), and (4.6)
can be recognized as structures labeled by (c), (d), (e),
and (f) in Fig. 1, respectively. This illustrates that a
suitable choice of the (σ, ǫ) parameters can controllably
reorder the energies of existing core inherent structures.
The structure labeled by (4.5) shows a newly induced
core geometry not present as a stable minimum in the
bare cluster. These two results demonstrate that we can
accomplish objectives (1) and (2) stated earlier.

Figure 5 represents the X12Y1 cluster at four points in
Fig. 3 deﬁned by the (σ, ǫ) coordinates (0.8,0.6), (0.8,1.0),
(0.8,1.5), and (0.8,2.0). Here the pairs of coordinates cor-
respond to (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Fig. 5, respectively. In
other words, we keep value of σ=0.8 ﬁxed, while increas-
ing the value of ǫ. The number of inherent structures
available to the X12Y1 cluster varies from at least 4153
in Fig. 5.a to at least 3641 in Fig. 5.d. Since we are
primarily interested in energetically low-lying inherent
structures we show only the lowest 200 inherent struc-
tures. The global minimum of each system is labeled
by the number 1 and contains as a recognizable compo-
nent the core structure labeled by (4.6) (see Fig. 4). In
Fig. 5.a the core structure (4.6) is connected to a group
of 12 inherent structures by pathways whose energies do
not exceed -39.4 (in units of ǫXX ). The energies of these
12 inherent structures are very close to each other and
their values are from lowest -39.810 to highest -39.614.
Their corresponding core structures are diﬀerent from the
core structure associated with the global minimum. This
implies that barriers that connect the global minimum

Fig. 5.d inherent structure 1 is connected to a group of
9 inherent structures. The lowest isomerization barrier
is ∆E1,3=3.509ǫXX connecting inherent structure 1 with
inherent structure 3. The double-funnel structure of the
disconnectivity graphs are evident especially in Fig. 5.a
and Fig. 5.b where the minima that deﬁne the two sep-
arated basins are so close in energy. The double-funnel
structure of the potential energy surface is reﬂected in
the classical heat capacity as discussed in the companion
paper.14 Below we ﬁnd similar double-funnel structures
for X11Y2.

We estimate the rate constants (lifetimes) for four tem-
peratures, 5, 10, 100, and 300 K, as a function of the
height of the isomerization barriers (ǫ). At the low tem-
peratures (5 and 10 K) the studied systems become ex-
tremely stable. By increasing the isomerization barrier
between the global minimum and the ﬁrst higher lying
inherent structure, from ∆E1,16=2.623ǫXX (see Fig. 5.a)
to ∆E1,6=3.269ǫXX (see Fig. 5.d) the lifetime increases
by nine and four orders of magnitude in the case of 5
and 10 K, respectively. To be more speciﬁc, at 10 K, the
lifetime increases from the order of seconds to the order
of days. This is illustrated in Fig. 14.a.

As illustrated in Fig. 5 and Fig. 14.a the barriers that
determine the isomerization kinetics are sensitive to the
(σ,ǫ) values and can thus be at least partially controlled.
Therefore, we have created selected structures that have
experimentally relevant lifetimes. These results are spe-
ciﬁc demonstrations of goal (3) stated earlier.

B. X11Y2

As a second illustration, we consider mixed clusters
of the type X11Y2. This system builds upon a parent,
eleven-atom system known to exhibit a set of 170, en-
ergetically distinct inherent structures29. The selected
core inherent structures and associated energies for the
stable X11 inherent structures are presented in Fig. 6. In
Fig. 7, a (σ, ǫ) contour plot of the core-atom potential
energies of the lowest total energy X11Y2 clusters, again
As il-
reveals the presence of deﬁnite “core-phases”.
lustrated in Fig. 8, some of these regions correspond to
various core structures present in the parent X11 system
while others correspond to new structures not seen in
the original, single-component cluster. We can see from
Figs. 7 to 9 that the impurity Y atoms provide us with
signiﬁcant control over the relative ordering of the core
energies of the parent X11 system. Moreover, since we
can manipulate the isomerization barriers in the X11Y2
systems, we can at least partially stabilize clusters that
exhibit selected core structures with respect to isomer-
ization. This is illustrated in Fig. 9.

Figures 9.a – 9.d represent the X11Y2 cluster at four
points in Fig. 7 with X11Y2(σ, ǫ) coordinates (0.8,0.5),
(0.8,1.0), (0.8,1.5) and (0.8,2.0), respectively. The num-
ber of inherent structures available to the X11Y2 cluster
in all four cases is more than 6000. We show only the

with the inherent structures in the group are “relevant”
barriers. The relevant barriers as those that connect in-
herent structures that contain diﬀerent core structures.
By examining the disconnectivity graph on a ﬁner energy
scale we ﬁnd that inherent structure 1 is connected, by
the lowest isomerization barrier, to inherent structure 16.
The numerical value of the lowest isomerization barrier
is ∆E1,16=2.623ǫXX. Figures. 5.b and 5.c show that in-
creasing the value of ǫ increases the isomerization barriers
that connect inherent structure 1 with a group of 12 and
9 inherent structures, respectively. Similarly to system
(a), the inherent structures associated with both groups
contain core structures that are diﬀerent from the core
structure associated with inherent structure 1. For sys-
tem (b) the lowest isomerization barrier that connects in-
herent structure 4 with inherent structure 1 has a numeri-
cal value ∆E1,4=2.960ǫXX while for system (c) the lowest
isomerization barrier connects inherent structure 1 with
inherent structure 6 and its value is ∆E1,6=3.269ǫXX. In

In Fig. 9.a the global minimum, the core
structure labeled by (8.8) in Fig. 8, is linked to inher-

one associated with the global minimum. The isomer-

1 and 4 are ∆E1,3=2.025ǫXX and ∆E1,4=2.011ǫXX, re-

increasing of the value of ǫ increases isomerization barri-
ers that link inherent structure 1 with inherent structure

As a third illustration, we consider mixed clusters of
the type X10Y3. This system builds upon a parent, ten-
atom, system known to exhibit a set of 64, energetically
distinct inherent structures29. The selected core inher-
ent structures and associated energies for the stable X10
inherent structures are presented in Fig. 10. A (σ, ǫ)

As illustrated in Fig. 12 some of the domains in Fig. 11

system X10 while others correspond to new structures

cally, the domains 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 correspond to the
core structures labeled by (a), (c), (f), (e), and (d) in
Fig. 10, respectively. Therefore, the impurity atoms Y
provide signiﬁcant control over relative ordering of the
core energies of the parent X10 system. Fig.13 illustrates
that, by choosing the appropriate set of (σ, ǫ) values we
can manipulate the isomerization barriers in the selected
systems.

Figures 13.a – 13.d represent the X10Y3 cluster at four
points in Fig. 11 with X10Y3(σ, ǫ) coordinates (0.8,0.5),
(0.8,1.0), (0.8,1.5) and (0.8,2.0), respectively. The num-
ber of inherent structures available to the X10Y3 cluster
in all four cases is more than 6000. We show only the
lowest 200 inherent structures. The global minimum of
each system is labeled by the number 1 and contains
as a recognizable component the core structure shown
in Fig. 12.9.
In Fig. 9.a inherent structure 1 is linked
to inherent structure 6 with the isomerization barrier
which value is ∆E1,6=0.779ǫXX. The core structure cor-
responding to inherent structure 6 is diﬀerent from the
core structure corresponding to the global minimum. In
Fig. 13.b inherent structure 1 is connected to inherent
structures 7 and 9 whose energy values are -43.177ǫXX
and -43.034ǫXX, respectively. Both inherent structures
7 and 9 contain core structures that are diﬀerent from
each other and from the one associated with inherent
structure 1. The isomerization barriers between inherent
structures 1 and 7 and 1 and 9 are ∆E1,7=2.138ǫXX and
∆E1,9=2.252ǫXX, respectively. Figures 9.c and Fig. 9.d
show that increasing of the value of ǫ increases isomer-
ization barriers that link inherent structure 1 with inher-
ent structures 9 and 12, respectively. Numerically, these
barriers are ∆E1,9=2.630ǫXX and ∆E1,12=2.883ǫXX, re-
spectively. It can be seen from Fig 14.c that by increasing
the height of isomerization barriers the lifetime can in-
crease by twenty-one and ten orders of magnitude at 5

IV. CONCLUSIONS

10

As stated at the outset, the general theme of the
present work is to explore the extent to which one can
induce controllable structural modiﬁcations in clusters.
One reason for pursuing such a development is the possi-
bility that such modiﬁcations might be a general tech-
nique for producing materials that have “interesting”
properties (electronic, magnetic, optical, thermal, etc.).
Depending on the application, one could envision such
clusters being of use either directly, or, if they could be
made suﬃciently robust, as precursors in subsequent as-
sembly of yet more complex materials.

Both current and previous work11 indicate that such
controllable modiﬁcations are possible in model Lennard-
Jones systems. In particular, we have demonstrated that
by introducing impurity atoms of varying size and in-
teraction energies, we can produce core-atom conform-
ers that correspond to a variety of non-minimum energy
homogeneous isomers. We have also shown that it is
also possible to use such impurities to generate core-atom
structures that posses no (stable) homogeneous analogs.
We have now demonstrated such capabilities for both the
simple X5Y2 and X7Y3 systems11 and for the larger, more
complex X12Y1, X11Y2, and X10Y3 binary clusters.

Finally, in the present work we have investigated the
issue of the stability of our modiﬁed clusters. Based on
simple transition-state estimates of the rates of isomer-
ization of the various clusters, we have demonstrated that
it is possible both to induce and to stabilize a variety of
structural modiﬁcations. In the companion14 paper we
investigate how the structures of the underlying poten-
tial energy surfaces explored in this work are reﬂected in
the thermodynamic properties of the systems.

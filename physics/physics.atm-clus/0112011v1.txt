exchange and many-body correlation eﬀects in metal clusters ﬁssion is analysed. It

is demonstrated that the inﬂuence of many-electron correlation eﬀects on the height

of the ﬁssion barrier is more profound if the barrier arises nearby or beyond the

scission point. The importance of cluster deformation eﬀects in the ﬁssion process is

elucidated with the use of the overlapping-spheroids shape parametrization allowing

one an independent variation of deformations in the parent and daughter clusters.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Fission of charged atomic clusters occurs when repulsive Coulomb forces, arising due to

the excessive charge, overcome the electronic binding energy of the cluster [1, 2, 3]. This

mechanism of the cluster ﬁssion is in a great deal similar to the nuclear ﬁssion phenomena.

Experimentally, multiply charged metal clusters can be observed in the mass spectra when

their size exceeds the critical size of stability, which depends on the metal species and cluster

charge [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. For clusters above critical size, simple evaporation of neutral species

is the dominant fragmentation channel, while below the critical size, ﬁssion into two charged

fragments is more probable. At a low temperature ﬁssioning clusters can be metastable

above a certain size, because of the existence of a ﬁssion barrier.

Initially, theoretical studies of cluster stability were based on pure energetic criteria that

only involved the energies of the initial and the ﬁnal states [10, 11, 12]. Later, a simple

one center Liquid Drop Model (LDM), which was initially suggested by Lord Rayleigh in

1882 [13] and later widely used in nuclear physics, was adapted to charged metal clusters

[14]. In this model, one introduces the ”ﬁssility parameter”, X = Eshere

Surf , which is
proportional to the ratio of the Coulomb to surface energy of charged spherical liquid drop

Coul /2Esphere

[13]. The ﬁssility parameter distinguishes the situations when cluster is unstable, metastable,

or stable. The investigation of the Rayleigh instabilities in multiply charged sodium clusters

has been done in [15], where reasonable agreement with experimental data was found.

In spite of the fact that the simple LDM qualitatively describes the ﬁssion process it fails

to reproduce experimental data in full detail. This happens because the LDM does not take

into account shell eﬀects. It has been shown that the shell eﬀects are important in nuclear

ﬁssion [18] and even more important in ﬁssion of metal clusters [7]. One can describe the

shell eﬀects in metal clusters using the Shell Correction Method (SCM), originally developed

in nuclear physics [16, 17, 18]. This method was adapted for metal clusters in [19, 20, 21,

22, 23, 24].

The asymmetric two-center-oscillator shell model (ATCOSM), introduced in [25] for nu-

clear ﬁssion is quite successful in prediction of the ﬁssion barriers. This model was also

applied for the description of metal cluster ﬁssion [26]. Although ATCOSM method uses

single electron model potential it has the signiﬁcant advantage in comparison to other mod-

els allowing one simple shape parametrization and an independent variation of deformations

in the parent and daughter clusters [26].

The microscopic description of energetics and dynamics of metal cluster ﬁssion process

based on molecular dynamic (MD) simulations has been performed in [27, 28, 29, 30] using

the local-spin-density-functional method. This method is, however, strongly restricted by

the cluster size, because of computational diﬃculties, and thus is usually applied to the

3

small metal clusters with the number of atoms N ≤ 20.

Fission process of metal clusters can be also simulated on the basis of the jellium model,

which does not take into account the detailed ionic structure of the cluster core. Jellium

model considers the electrons in the usual quantum mechanical way, but approximates the

cluster core potential by the potential of the homogeneous positively charged background

and, therefore, is better applicable for lager cluster sizes (see e.g. [31] for review). Most of

the electronic structure calculations of the jellium metal clusters have been performed using

self-consistent Kohn-Sham Local Density Approximation (LDA) [32]. The LDA jellium

calculations for metal cluster ﬁssion can be grouped [26] into two categories according to the

fragment shape parametrization, namely, the two-intersected-spheres jellium [33, 34, 35] and

variable-necking-in parametrization [36, 37, 38]. It has been shown that the cluster shape

parametrization must be ﬂexible enough to account for the majority of eﬀects generated by

the shell structure of the parent and daughter clusters, which in general have not spherical

but deformed shapes [26].

The important feature of the LDA method consists in the fact that it takes into ac-

count many-electron correlations via the phenomenological exchange-correlation potential

(see e.g. [39, 40] for review). However, so far, there has not been found the unique poten-

tial, universally applicable for diﬀerent systems and conditions. As a result there is a ”zoo

of potentials” [41] valid for special cases. These potentials, of course, do exist in principle

as unique quantities but are not actually understood, so they cannot serve as a satisfactory

basis for achieving a physical interpretation.

Alternatively, one can develop direct ab initio methods for the description of electronic

properties of metal clusters. It can be achieved by using the Hartree-Fock (HF) approxi-

mation and by the construction on its basis the systematic many-body theories such as the

random phase approximation with exchange [42], many-body perturbation theory or the

Dyson equation method [43, 44, 45]. Based on fundamental physical principles these models

can be reﬁned by extending the quality of the approximations, while the physical meaning

of the eﬀects included are clearly demonstrated and thus give more accurate characteristics

of metal clusters than LDA.

Originally, the Hartree-Fock model for the metal cluster electron structure has been

worked out in the framework of spherically symmetric jellium approximation in [46, 47]. It

is valid for the clusters with closed electronic shells that correspond to magic numbers (8,

4

20, 34, 40,...). On the basis of the Hartree-Fock approach the dynamic jellium model has

been proposed [48, 49]. This model treats simultaneously the vibrational modes of the ionic

jellium background, the quantized electron motion and the interaction between the electronic

and the ionic subsystems.

In particular, the dynamic jellium model allows to describe

the widths of electron excitations in metal clusters beyond the adiabatic approximation.

The open-shell two-center jellium Hartree-Fock approximation valid for metal clusters with

arbitrary number of the valence electrons has been developed in [50, 51]. The two-center

jellium HF method treats the quantized electron motion in the ﬁeld of the spheroidal ionic

jellium background in the spheroidal coordinates. This method has been generalized and

adopted to study of the metal clusters ﬁssion process in our recent work [52], where barrier
for the symmetric ﬁssion cannel Na2+

9 was calculated.

18 → 2Na+

In the present work we investigate the role of the exchange and correlation eﬀects in

metal cluster ﬁssion process on the basis of both the Hartree-Fock and LDA methods.
Both symmetric and asymmetric ﬁssion channels for the Na2+

18 parent clusters

10 and Na2+

are considered. Comparison of results of the two approaches allows us to illustrate the

importance of the exchange component of the many-electron interaction in the ﬁssion process

and make important conclusion about the relative role of the two diﬀerent channels of the

reaction.

II. THEORETICAL METHODS

A. Two-center jellium model and cluster shape parametrization

According to the main postulate of the jellium model, the electron motion in a metal-

lic cluster takes place in the ﬁeld of the uniform positive charge distribution of the ionic

background. For the parametrization of the ionic background during the ﬁssion process we

consider the model in which the initial parent cluster having the form of the ellipsoid of

revolution (spheroid) splits into two independently deformed spheroids of smaller size [52].

The two principal diameters ak and bk of the spheroids can be expressed via the deformation

parameter δk as

2/3

ak =

2 + δk
2 − δk (cid:19)

(cid:18)

Rk,

bk =

2 − δk
2 + δk (cid:19)

(cid:18)

1/3

Rk.

Here partial indexes k = 0, 1, 2 correspond to the parent cluster (k = 0) and the two daughter

fragments (k = 1, 2), Rk (k = 0, 1, 2) are the radii of the corresponding undeformed spherical

cluster. The deformation parameters δk characterize the families of the prolate (δk > 0) and
the oblate (δk < 0) spheroids of equal volume Vk = 4πakb2

k/3 = 4πR3

k/3.

The radii of the parent and the resulting non overlapping daughter fragments are equal to

1/3
Rk = rsN
k

, where Nk is the number of atoms in the kth cluster, and rs is the Wigner-Seitz

radius. For sodium clusters, rs = 4.0, which corresponds to the density of the bulk sodium.

For overlapping region the radii R1(d) and R2(d) are functions of the distance d between the

centers of mass of the two fragments. They are so determined that the total volume inside
the two spheroids equals the volume of the parent cluster 4πR3

0/3.

The ions charge density ρ(r) is kept uniform including the overlapping-spheroids region,

otherwise.

Here ρc = Z0/V0 is the ionic charge density inside the cluster and Z0 is the total charge of

the ionic core.

The electrostatic potential Ucore(r) of the ionic background can be determined from the

solution of the corresponding Poisson equation:

∆Ucore(r) = −4πρ(r).

B. Hartree-Fock and LDA formalism

The Hartree-Fock equations can be written out explicitly in the form (see, e.g., [53]):

(−∆/2 + Ucore + UHF ) | a > = εa | a > .

The ﬁrst term here represents the kinetic energy of electron a, and Ucore its attraction to

the cluster core. The Hartree-Fock potential UHF represents the average Coulomb interac-

tion of electron a with the other electrons in the cluster, including the non-local exchange

interaction, and εa describes the single electron energy.

According to the Density Functional Theory (DFT), the ground state energy is a mini-

mum for the exact density of the functional of the density of the system [54]. A self-consistent

method for calculation of the electronic states of many-electron systems was proposed by

Kohn and Sham [32]. This method leads to the Kohn-Sham LDA self consistent equations,

which are similar to the Hartree equations:

(−∆/2 + Ucore + UH + Vxc) | a > = εa | a > .

(5)

Here UH is the Hartree potential, which represents the direct Coulomb interaction of elec-

tron a with the other electrons in the cluster, but does not take into account the non-

local exchange eﬀects, while Vxc is the phenomenological density dependent local exchange-

correlation potential. In the present work we use the Gunnarsson and Lundqvist model [55]

for the LDA electron exchange-correlation energy density ǫxc, which reads as

ǫxc(ρel(r)) = −

− 0.0333 G (rs(r)/11.4) .

Here rs(r) = (3/4πρel(r))1/3 is a local Wigner-Seitz radius, while ρel(r) is the electron density

in the cluster, and the function G(x) is deﬁned by following relation:

The Hartree-Fock (4) and LDA (5) equations have been solved in the system of the

prolate spheroidal coordinates as a system of coupled two-dimensional second order partial

diﬀerential equations. The partial diﬀerential equations have been discretized on a two-

dimensional grid and the resulting system of linear equations has been solved numerically

by the successive overrelaxation method [56]. This technique is diﬀerent from that we

have used in our previous works [50, 51, 52], where the expansion of wave functions and

potentials over spheroidal harmonics in the prolate and oblate spheroidal coordinates in

one dimension and a numerical expansion for the second dimension have been carried out.

7

(9)

(10)

The third dimension, the azimuthal angle, has been treated analytically in both methods.

Our calculations show that the partial-expansion method is eﬀective for slightly deformed

systems, for which only few terms in the expansion are necessary to take into account in

order to achieve suﬃcient accuracy. However, for strongly deformed systems, or process like

ﬁssion, the direct two-dimensional integration is more eﬃcient.

The important characteristic of the cluster, which deﬁnes its stability is the total energy

Etot. The total energy of the cluster is equal to the sum of the electrostatic energy of the

ionic core Ecore and the energy of the valence electrons Eel:

The electrostatic energy of the cluster ionic core is equal to

Etot = Ecore + Eel.

Ecore =

ρ(r)Ucore(r)dr.

In the Hartree-Fock approximation, the electronic energy Eel is given by the general

expression [53]:

(cid:3)

where a and b run over all shells. The values F k(a, b) and Gk(a, b) in the Eq. (11) are the

Coulomb and exchange Slater integrals, qa and qb are the occupation numbers for orbitals

a and b, respectively. The Hatree-Fock coeﬃcients c(abk) and d(abk) for the Coulomb and

exchange energy contributions depend on the occupation numbers (see for details [53]).

In the framework of LDA the electronic energy of the system is given by [32, 54]:

The second part of our discussion is devoted to the cluster energetics and formation of ﬁs-

sion barriers, for the ﬁssion channels considered. We compare the results obtained for the

two overlapping spheres and the two overlapping spheroids parametrization, as well as the

variable-necking-in type of the shape parametrization and demonstrate the crucial impor-

tance of the cluster shape deformations in the ﬁssion process.

The initial electronic conﬁguration for the parent Na2+

With increasing fragments separation distance d, the spherical symmetry of the parent

cluster breaks down, that results in splitting of the single electron energy levels according to

projection of the angular momentum along the z-axis. A similar splitting of the energy levels

has been studied for deformed nuclei (see e.g. [57]) and clusters [50, 51]. For high enough

10

separation distances beyond the scission point, indicated by vertical arrow A in ﬁgure 1,

energy levels approach to their limiting values marked by horizontal lines on the right hand
side of the ﬁgure, being the electron energy levels of the free ﬁssion fragments Na+
7 (1σ21π4)
and Na+

3 (1σ2).

The electronic conﬁguration and the orbital occupation numbers for Na2+

18 cluster exhibits

several alterations during the ﬁssion process, as it is shown in ﬁgures 2 and 3. This happens

due to the fact that diﬀerent electronic conﬁgurations minimize the total energy of the
cluster at diﬀerent separation distances. The parent cluster Na2+
conﬁguration 1σ22σ21π42π23σ21δ4. Following to the asymmetric channel of ﬁssion Na2+
Na+

18 →
3 (see ﬁgure 2) the new conﬁguration 1σ22σ21π43σ24σ21δ4 becomes preferable,

18 has the initial electronic

15 + Na+

when two electrons transfer from the half-ﬁlled 2π state to initially unoccupied 4σ state.

This happens for the separation distance d ≥ 14.2 a.u. (marked in ﬁgure 2 by the solid

vertical arrow A) before the scission point (vertical arrow B) d = 15.3 a.u. The order of

the energy levels manifests several re-distributions during the ﬁssion process, and ﬁnally for

high enough separation distance (d > 25 a.u.), its energy levels correspond to the free ﬁssion
fragments Na+

15 (1σ22σ21π43σ21δ4 ) and Na+

For the symmetric ﬁssion channel Na2+

9 (ﬁgure 3) the energy levels show even

3 (1σ2).
18 → 2Na+

more complicated behaviour. Thus, for the separation distance d ≥ 0.7 a.u. (marked in
ﬁgure 3 by solid vertical arrow A) the new intermediate conﬁguration 1σ22σ21π41δ22π43σ2

becomes preferable, when two electrons transfer from the occupied 1δ to the half-ﬁlled 2π

state. Further increasing of the separation distance, leads to the transition of the two residual

1δ electrons to the initially unoccupied 4σ state for d ≥ 9.25 a.u. (marked in ﬁgure 3 by
the solid vertical arrow B) forming the ﬁnal electronic conﬁguration 1σ22σ21π43σ22π44σ2

before the scission point (vertical arrow C) d = 16.64 a.u. The order of the energy levels

manifests several re-distributions during the ﬁssion process, and ﬁnally for high enough

separation distance (d > 25 a.u.), its ordering corresponds to 1σ2σ1π which determined by
the magic spherical Na+
conﬁguration, since there are two Na+

9 products. They are doubly degenerated as compared to the initial

9 fragments in the system. Such a behaviour of the HF

levels as a function of d is quite similar to those following from the ATCOSM simulations

[26].

into account. The zero of energy put at d = 0. The evolution of cluster shape during the ﬁssion

of ﬁssion barriers derived in the two-center deformed jellium HF and LDA models with the

ATCOSM results [26], we have used two diﬀerent type of shape parametrization. Thus,

the upper part in ﬁgure 4 shows the barriers for ﬁssion of a spherical parent cluster into

two spherical daughter fragments (i.e. δ0 = δ1 = δ2 = 0 in our model). This type of

parametrization, known as the two-intersected spheres parametrization, was used in many

works [33, 34, 35]. The low part in ﬁgure 4 shows ﬁssion barriers derived on the basis of

parametrization accounting for an independent deformation of parent and daughter clusters

in order to minimize the total energy of the system for any distance d. The evolution of

cluster shape during the ﬁssion process is shown for the HF and LDA models on tops of the

corresponding ﬁgures. Note, that the variable-necking-in parametrization has been used in

the ATCOSM calculation [26].

Solid lines in ﬁgure 4 are the result of the two-center jellium HF model, while dashed

curves have been calculated in LDA. Dash-dotted lines show the ATCOSM barriers calcu-

lated in [26]. The zero of energy put at d = 0.

Figure 4 (a) demonstrates a good agreement of the HF and ATCOSM ﬁssion barriers

heights ∆HF = ∆AT COSM = 0.95 eV. The LDA value for the ﬁssion barrier, ∆LDA = 1.30

eV, slightly exceeds the HF and ATCOSM ones. In HF and LDA schemes the ﬁssion barrier

maximum is located just behind the scission point (marked by vertical arrow A).

The two-intersected spheres parametrization is not adequate for the description of the

process Na2+

10 → Na+

7 + Na+

3 , because Na+

7 daughter fragment has an open-shell electronic

structure, and therefore its shape is not spherical because it undergoes Jahn-Teller distortion

[24]. The deformed jellium Hartree-Fock and LDA calculations show that the ground state of
the Na+

7 cluster has the oblate shape with the deformation parameter δ1 = −0.68. This value

is in a good agreement with other theoretical estimates [50]. The oblate shape deformation

of the daughter cluster reduces the ﬁnal total energy of the system Etot by −1.32 eV for

the HF, and by −1.05 eV for the LDA model calculations, in comparison with the spherical

case.

Part (b), ﬁgure 4 shows ﬁssion barriers for the asymmetric channel Na2+

10 → Na+

7 + Na+
3 ,

when spheroidal deformations of the parent and daughter clusters are taken into account.

We have minimized the total energy of the system over the parent and daughter fragments

deformations with the aim to ﬁnd the ﬁssion pathway corresponding to the minimum of the

ﬁssion barrier. We have also used the assumption of continuous shape deformation during

13

the ﬁssion process. The deformation of the cluster fragments changes drastically the ﬁssion

energetics in comparison with what follows from the two-intersected spheres model.

In

the framework of the two-center deformed jellium Hartree-Fock approximation, the parent
cluster Na2+

10 becomes unstable towards the asymmetric channel Na2+

10 → Na+

7 + Na+
3 .

The LDA simulations with deformation of the daughter ﬁssion fragments take into account

the decrease of the total energy of the system (see ﬁgure 4b). In particular, this results in the

appearance of the local minimum in the energy curve at d = 7.2 a.u., corresponding to the
formation of the super deformed asymmetric prolate shape of the parent Na2+

10 cluster before

the scission point A. The latter is located at d = 10.4 a.u. The allowance for deformation

of the parent cluster and the ﬁssion fragments reduces the LDA ﬁssion barrier up to the

value ∆LDA = 0.16 eV, which is in rather poor agreement with the result of ATCOSM

∆AT COSM = 0.52 eV.

It is necessary to note that the shape of the cluster fragments in ATCOSM has been

parametrized by two spheroids of revolution connected by a smooth neck [26]. Our calcu-
lations show that the oblate shape of Na+

7 fragment is formed at the initial stage of ﬁssion

process, for separation distances before the scission point. Moreover, in the vicinity of the
scission point, where the interaction between the two daughter fragments Na+
7 and Na+
3
is strong, the oblate Na+

7 fragment is even more deformed than a free one. This means

that it is more favourable for two fragments to split at shorter distances rather than to

be connected by a smooth neck, making the system more prolate. This fact explains why

using of necking type of shape parametrization, leads to the higher barrier as compare to

our parametrization.

ﬁssion channels of the parent Na2+
18 cluster is a subject of particular interest, because there
have to be a competition between these two channels involving magic cluster ions Na+

and Na+
fragment other than Na+
the asymmetric channel Na2+
corresponding to oblate shape of the parent Na2+
δ0 = −0.35. The oblate deformation reduces the total energy of the cluster Na2+

parent and daughter fragments during the ﬁssion process for any separation distance d. The

evolution of the fragment shapes is shown on top of the ﬁgure for both HF and LDA models.
The daughter fragment Na+
while Na+

15 has an oblate shape with deformation parameter δ1 = −0.6,

3 is spherical, i.e. δ2 = 0.

The total energy as a function of the fragment separation distance has a maximum

(marked by vertical arrow A for HF, and A
for LDA), arising due to the alteration of
the electronic conﬁguration 1σ22σ21π42π23σ21δ4 → 1σ22σ21π43σ24σ21δ4. These maxima

′

on the energy curves deﬁne the ﬁssion barrier hights, being equal to ∆HF = 0.36 eV for

Hartree-Fock and ∆LDA = 0.50 eV for LDA. It is interesting to notice that the LDA total

energy curve has a pronounced minimum at d = 12.5 a.u., located beyond the scission point

d = 11.1 a.u. We have marked the scission point by vertical arrow B, both for HF and
LDA. This minimum means that a quasistable state of the supermolecule Na+

15 + Na+

3 can

be created during the ﬁssion process. However, the appearance of the minimum and thus

the stability of the super molecule is rather sensitive to the model chosen for the description

of exchange and correlation inter-electron interaction. This is already clear from the fact

that such a minimum does not appear in the HF simulations (see ﬁgure 5).

The ATCOSM model calculation gives the value of the ﬁssion barrier ∆AT COSM = 1.35

eV, which is inconsistent with the HF and LDA results derived in our model. Such a diﬀer-

ence can be explained as a result of variable-necking-in type of the shape parametrization,

which has been used in [26].

In the case of asymmetric Na2+

15 + Na+

3 channel,

the parent as well as one of the daughter fragments have an oblate shape, therefore shape

parametrization model with prolate-like additional neck is not natural, and results in in-

creasing the ﬁssion barrier.

Figure 6 shows the dependence of total energy Etot on separation distance d for the sym-

metric channel Na2+

18 → 2Na+

9 . The parent cluster changes its shape from oblate to prolate

one on the initial stage of the ﬁssion process (d ≈ 1 a.u.). This transition is accompanied

by the ﬁrst re-arrangement of the electronic conﬁguration (marked by vertical arrow A for

HF and A

for LDA). This process has the barrier ∆HF = 0.63 eV and ∆LDA = 0.48 eV.

On the next stage of the reaction the prolate deformation develops resulting in the highly

deformed cluster shape, as it is shown on top of ﬁgure 6. At the distance d ≈ 11 (marked

by vertical arrow B for HF, and B
form being the same as in the spherical Na+

′

for LDA) the electronic conﬁguration reaches its ﬁnal

9 products. In this case, the variable-necking-in

type of fragments shape parametrization used in ATCOSM does not brake the symmetry

of the fragments and therefore the agreement between the two overlapped spheroids HF or

LDA models and ATCOSM variable-necking-in approach is much better than in the case

of asymmetric ﬁssion channel. Indeed, the total ﬁssion barrier for the symmetric channel
Na2+

9 is equal to ∆HF = 0.63 eV and ∆LDA = 0.48 eV in the two-center jellium

18 → 2Na+

Hartree-Fock and LDA models respectively. These values are in a good agreement with the

ATCOSM result ∆AT COSM = 0.52 eV [26].

In table I we have summarized the results of the HF and LDA barrier heights calculations

for the considered ﬁssion channels and compared them with the results of ATCOSM [26]

and MD simulations [27, 29, 30].

The height of the ﬁssion barrier for Na2+

10 cluster in the two-center deformed jellium LDA

model is 0.51 eV lower than its value following from the MD simulations [29]. Molecular

dynamics simulations performed in [29] also were based on the density-functional theory,

but included full ionic structure of the cluster. Since both methods apply the same form of

the density functional [55], the discrepancy in the ﬁssion barrier heights can be attributed

to the manifestation of the inﬂuence of the cluster ionic structure in the ﬁssion process. One

can expect that the inﬂuence of the detailed ionic structure has to decrease with the growth

cluster size, making the jellium model approach more and more accurate. However, we also

want to notice here that diﬀerent schemes of MD simulations [27, 29, 30] lead to somewhat

diﬀerent ﬁssion barrier heights (see Table III).

For the Na2+

18 cluster, we report a very good agreement of the heights of ﬁssion barriers

derived in the jellium LDA model and MD [29]. It is interesting to note that MD simulations
predict the asymmetric channel Na2+
the jellium LDA model says in favour of the symmetric path Na2+

3 to be a little more favourable, however
18 → 2Na+

9 . Although, in

18 → Na+

15 +Na+

both models the diﬀerence in the heights of symmetric and asymmetric ﬁssion barriers is

rather small, being equal to 0.02 eV.

Finally, let us compare the results obtained in the HF and LDA models. The Hartree-

Fock model takes into account the exchange inter-electron interaction the most exactly,

18 clusters on −5.58

eV and −12.03 eV respectively as compared to the energies calculated in the Hartree-Fock

approximation. Such a diﬀerence between the total energies of the HF and LDA jellium

clusters is a result of the manifestation of many-electron correlation interaction. The many-

electron correlation interaction reduces at distances d beyond the scission point, when the

parent cluster splits on the two fragments, due to decrease of the number of interacting

electrons in the system.

For illustrative purposes we use here the two overlapping sphere parametrization to dismiss

the eﬀect of the clusters fragment shape alteration along the ﬁssion pathway, which can be

diﬀerent in the HF or LDA schemes of calculation.

It is seen from ﬁgure 7 that the diﬀerence between the LDA and HF total energies

tot does not change signiﬁcantly for separation distances below the scission point,

in spite of the strong deformation of the parent cluster. In the narrow region of d, nearby

the scission point the value ELDA

increases and it becomes constant again above

the scission point. Such a behavior is in a great deal similar, at least qualitatively, to the

18

all considered ﬁssion channels.

It remains valid even if deformations of the parent and

daughter fragments are taken into account. This fact has a simple physical explanation.

The many-electron correlations reduce the total energy. During the ﬁssion process the

many-electron correlation interaction between electrons belonging the two diﬀerent cluster

fragments vanishes, which results in the increase of the total energy of the system.

In spite of the fact that many-electron correlations reduce signiﬁcantly the total energy

of the Na2+

10 and Na2+

18 jellium clusters in comparison with the HF values, the diﬀerence in

heights of the ﬁssion barriers obtained in the HF and LDA models is only about 0.15 eV.

From the analysis carried out above one can conclude that many-electron correlations do

not inﬂuence signiﬁcantly on the height of the ﬁssion barrier if the latter arises well below

before the scission point.

In the cases when the barrier is created nearby or above the

scission point, accounting for many-electron correlations becomes essential. For example,
many-electron correlations play the crucial role for the Na2+

3 ﬁssion channel.

In this case the HF model predicts qualitatively wrong barrierless scenario of the ﬁssion.

In the contrary, the agreement between the HF and LDA models is much better for both

IV. SUMMARY

We have developed the open-shell two-center deformed jellium Hartree-Fock and LDA

method for the description of metal clusters ﬁssion process. The proposed two overlapping

sheroids shape parametrization allows one to consider independently a wide variety of shape

deformations of parent and daughter clusters, and to investigate the role of deformation

eﬀects on the cluster ﬁssion process. The proposed type of shape parametrization is prefer-

able as compared to variable-necking-in one, in particular when the ﬁssion fragments have

an oblate shape. The role of many-electron correlation eﬀects in metal clusters ﬁssion is

analysed. The described Hartree-Fock model forms the basis for further systematic devel-
opment of the more advanced ab initio many-body theories for the process of metal clusters

ﬁssion.

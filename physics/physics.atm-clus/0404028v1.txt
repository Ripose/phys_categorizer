Abstract

This theoretical paper presents numerical calculations for photoassociation of ultracold cesium

atoms with a chirped laser pulse and detailed analysis of the results.

In contrast with earlier

work, the initial state is represented by a stationary continuum wavefunction.

In the chosen

example, it is shown that an important population transfer is achieved to
in the vicinity of the v=98 bound level in the external well of the 0−

≈

15 vibrational levels

g (6s + 6p3/2) potential. Such

levels lie in the energy range swept by the instantaneous frequency of the pulse, thus deﬁning a

“photoassociation window”. Levels outside this window may be signiﬁcantly excited during the

pulse, but no population remains there after the pulse. Finally, the population transfer to the

last vibrational levels of the ground a3Σ+

u (6s + 6s) is signiﬁcant, making stable molecules. The

results are interpreted in the framework of a two state model as an adiabatic inversion mechanism,

eﬃcient only within the photoassociation window. The large value found for the photoassociation

rate suggests promising applications. The present chirp has been designed in view of creating a

vibrational wavepacket in the excited state which is focussing at the barrier of the double well

potential.

INTRODUCTION

After ultracold atoms, ultracold molecules are presently a subject of constant interest,

stimulated further by the recent observation of molecular condensates [1, 2, 3]. This is why

the various routes leading to the formation of ultracold molecules are actively explored [4].

Starting from molecular beams, two non-optical techniques, buﬀer gas cooling of molecules

[5, 6] and Stark deceleration of polar molecules [7, 8] now reach temperatures well below 1K.

Another route relies on optical techniques: laser ﬁelds are used to cool down alkali atoms, and

to create molecules via the photoassociation reaction [9]. Short-lived molecules formed in an

excited electronic state must then be stabilized, by spontaneous emission or other radiative

coupling, into bound vibrational levels of the ground electronic state [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].

The translational temperatures are much lower (T

20µK) and higher densities are to be

≤

expected than with non-optical techniques. An important drawback, however, is that the

stable molecules are produced in a superposition of vibrational levels, among which some are

very excited. Bringing such molecules to the v =0 level of the ground electronic state, thus

reaching ultralow vibrational temperatures, is therefore an important issue. More generally,

ﬁnding new photoassociation and stabilization schemes is an interesting research subject.

Up to now, photoassociation experiments have mostly been using continuous lasers: a

more active role of the radiation would be to optimize the reaction by shaping laser pulses.

The aim of the present paper and of the following ones is to explore the feasibility and ad-

vantages of experiments using chirped pulses to form ultracold molecules, therefore bridging

the gap between the subjects of ultracold matter and coherent control.

The ﬁeld of coherent control has developed both theoretically [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] and

experimentally [21, 22, 23] with quite diﬀerent applications, such as photodissociation of

molecules. It has indeed been demonstrated that shaping laser pulses could enhance consid-

erably the yield of a photodissociation reaction, so that a similar eﬀect is expected for the

reverse reaction.

Very few papers consider the photoassociation reaction with pulsed lasers: in the ther-

mal regime, ultrafast photoassociation has been studied [24, 25, 27], showing the validity of

the impulsive approximation. In the ultracold regime, several theoretical and experimental

papers have proposed a time-dependent study of the photoassociation reaction [26, 28, 29],

eventually considering also the formation of long-lived ultracold molecules [30]. Most the-

2

oretical calculations are using a wavepacket representation for the initial state of the two

colliding atoms. In this framework, considering a wavepacket localized at the outer classical

turning point of the photoassociated level, our group has discussed the characteristic times

for photoassociation of cold cesium atoms [31] and the separation of time scales.

Photoassociation of cold atoms with a chirped-pulsed-laser ﬁeld was ﬁrst theoretically

explored by Vala et al [36]: appreciating the slow nuclear relative motion in ultracold colli-

sions, a chirped pulse was optimized to achieve total transfer of population under adiabatic

following conditions proposed by Cao, Bardeen and Wilson [34, 35]. In these calculations

the initial state was represented by a gaussian wavepacket and a total population trans-

fer was indeed obtained in the region of distances where this wavepacket is localized. The

drawback of both this study and Ref.

[31] was that they overlooked the precise nature of

the initial continuum state. Since the collision energy is so close to threshold, a plane wave

description or a superposition of Gaussian wavepackets do not address the actual shape of

the wavefunction. A correct representation of the initial continuum state of two ultracold

colliding atoms should be a stationary continuum state: indeed, experiments with continu-

ous photoassociation lasers identify several nodes of the stationary wavefunction as minima

in the photoassociation signal [10, 32].

The aim of the present paper is to go further in that direction, considering now pho-

toassociation with chirped laser pulses when the initial state is a delocalized continuum

wavefunction representing the relative motion of two atoms at very low collision energies

kT . Such a wavefunction displays very slow oscillations at large distances, and numerical

calculations must then use large spatial grids. On the other hand, for ultracold processes,

where the initial continuum state is very close to threshold, even a very weak light ﬁeld

couples the last bound vibrational levels of the ground electronic surface, which must also

be correctly represented on the grid. Then, the numerical calculations need a mapping

procedure in order to reduce the number of grid points [37, 38].

It should be appreciated that the vibrational levels of the photoassociated molecule, being

close to the dissociation limit, are physically very diﬀerent from lower lying vibrational

states. Their vibrational periods are orders of magnitude longer and most of the amplitude

is concentrated in the outer turning point. As a result, for even weak light ﬁelds, the Rabi

period associated with population transfer to the excited state can be shorter than the typical

vibrational periods. For short enough pulses, the relative motion of the two atoms during

3

the pulse duration can be neglected, thus allowing simple interpretations in the framework

of the impulsive limit for light-matter interaction [33]. This implies that, during the pulse,

the wavefunction at each nuclear separation can be decoupled from other positions, so that

each distance can be considered as a radiation coupled two-level-system, where transfer of

population is analyzed. Another limit now emerging is the limit of adiabatic transfer, where

the intensity of the light is suﬃcient so that the associated Rabi period is smaller than all

other relevant timescales.

The paper shows how a two-state model can be developed to provide analysis of the

results within an adiabatic population inversion mechanism, eﬀective only within a range

of energies deﬁning a photoassociation window. Also discussed is the possibility of avoiding

population transfer outside this window. An example of application is the focussing process,

where photoassociation is creating in the excited electronic state a vibrational wavepacket

optimized for transfer to a vibrational level of the ground state via a second pulse.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section II we recall the theoretical model for pho-

toassociation with chirped laser pulses. In Section III we discuss the various timescales of
the problem. In Section IV we give an example of numerical calculations for Cs2 0−

g pho-

toassociation, with a chosen chirped pulse, where a few neighbouring vibrational levels stay

populated after the pulse. For interpretation, section V develops, in the framework of the

impulsive limit, a two-state adiabatic model for population inversion within a photoasso-

ciation window.

In Section VI, the validity of this adiabatic approximation is discussed.

Section VII is the discussion of the numerical results in the frame of the simple model for

adiabatic population transfer. Finally, in Section VIII we show how the chirp parameter can

be chosen in view of focussing a vibrational wavepacket of the photoassociated molecules,

such as control of the formation of stable ultracold molecules can be performed. Section IX

is the conclusion.

In a forthcoming paper, hereafter referred to as paper II, we shall give more examples

for numerical calculations and discuss optimization of the photoassociation yield and of the

cold molecule formation rates.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

A. The photoassociation reaction

The photoassociation reaction starts from two cold atoms, at a temperature T , colliding

in the ground state potential Vground, and which absorb a photon red-detuned compared to

a resonance line to yield a molecule in a vibrational level of the excited electronic potential

Vexc. We shall consider the example of two cold cesium atoms colliding in the lower triplet

a3Σ+

u (6s + 6s) potential, and forming a molecule in a vibrational level of the 0−

g (6s + 6p3/2)

potential:

Cs(6s2S1/2) + Cs(6s2S1/2) + ¯hωL →

Cs2(0−

g (6s2S1/2 + 6p2P3/2; v, J)).

(1)

The reaction (1) is the usual representation of the photoassociation, using a continuous laser

red-detuned by δat

L relative to the D2 resonance line:

¯hωL = ¯hωat −

δat
L ,

(2)

where ¯hωat
vibrational level of the 0−

is the energy of the atomic transition 6s

6p3/2, which excites a single

→
g electronic state. In the present work, we shall treat excitation

with a chirped laser pulse characterized by time-dependent frequency ω(t) or detuning

δat
L (t), and which populates several vibrational levels.

As indicated in Fig.1, the 0−

g (6s + 6p2P3/2) potential curve displays a double well
structure with a hump located around 15 a0. The levels populated by the photoassociation

reaction correspond to vibrational motion in the outer well: vtot is the vibrational quantum

number in the full potential, while v is the numbering of the levels in the external well.

In the experimental photoassociation spectrum, vibrational levels from v=0 to v=132 are

identiﬁed [39]. For two levels, a tunneling eﬀect is present which has been analyzed from

the photoassociation spectrum [40].

The theoretical model that we are presenting is of course not connected to the particular

shape of the excited potential Vexc.

5

B. The two-channel coupled equations

The dynamics in the ground state and the excited state is described by the time-dependent

Schr¨odinger equation

ˆHΨ(R, t) = [ ˆHmol + ˆW(t)]Ψ(R, t) = i¯h

Ψ(R, t).

(3)

where Ψ(R, t) is a two-component wavefunction, with Ψground(R, t) and Ψexc(R, t) describing

the radial relative motion of the nuclei in the ground and excited potential respectively.
The molecular Hamiltonian ˆHmol = ˆT + ˆVel is the sum of the kinetic energy operator ˆT
and electronic potential energy operator ˆVel. The coupling term is written in the dipole

approximation:

the matrix elements of the dipole moment operator components between the ground and

the excited molecular electronic states. Since the photoassociation reaction occurs at large

distances, we shall neglect the R

dependence, using the asymptotic value ~Dge(R)

In order to optimize the formation rate of molecules, we shall consider gaussian ”chirped”

pulses [34], where the laser ﬁeld

(t) has a quadratic time-dependent phase ϕ(t), hence a

to note that the discussion reported here is general and can be adapted for other types of

temporal envelopes than the gaussian one employed here, as for more general chirp rates

that could be deﬁned, beyond the linear approximation (Eq.(18)) used in the present paper.

atomic resonance frequency in terms of the detuning δat

In the following, we shall assume that the relative phase of the ground and excited electronic

In contrast, the chirp does not modify the width of the pulse in the frequency domain,
which stays proportional to 1/τL. Indeed, ˜

The deﬁnition of such a time window will reveal very useful for the analysis of the

We have represented in Fig. 2a the typical variation of the amplitude of a transform limited

pulse and of the pulse obtained through linear chirp, illustrating both the stretching of the

temporal width from τL to τC, the reduction of the peak intensity, and the conservation of

the energy carried by the ﬁeld. The energy range swept during the time-variation of the

frequency (see Eq.(18)) is illustrated in Fig. 2b.

3. Coupled radial equations for excitation with a chirped pulse

When considering excitation via a chirped pulse, we may apply the rotating wave approx-

imation as previously at the carrier frequency ωL. Once the terms oscillating as exp[

2iωLt]

±

are eliminated, the resulting coupling term is time-dependent with a phase variation, so that

the coupled equations now are

However, the existence of a complex coupling term makes the discussion intricated:

it is

therefore convenient to modify further the rotating frame by deﬁning new wavefunctions for

It is important to note that, in contrast with cw excitation, the relative position of the

two potential curves at a given distance R now varies linearly as a function of t. Hence, at

some distances the upper curve may become the lower or vice versa, while the position of

their crossing point RC(t), such that

∆(RC(t), t) = 0; RC(tP ) = RL

(30)

varies with time around the distance RL deﬁned in Eq. (12).
We shall consider situations where during the time window [tP −

The deﬁnition of such a resonance window requires two conditions on the width of the pulse

intensity. However, it depends upon our choice for the temporal window, and this point will

be further discussed below.

Writing the resonance condition from Eq.(30), which depends upon the central frequency

of the pulse, would be misleading: due to the spectral width, a range of levels in the

neighbourhood of the resonant level can be excited. We shall discuss in more details these

two aspects of the excitation with a particular example.

III. TIME SCALES

A. Time scales related to the radiation

The two radiative phenomena in our problem are the spontaneous emission time Tspont

and the Rabi period associated to the coupling with the laser. We shall study phenomena

at a time scale short compared to Tspont. For a cw laser, the period T L

Rabi of the “Rabi

oscillations” associated with the coupling WL between the two states resonantly coupled is

T L
Rabi =

¯hπ
WL

.

Once a pulsed laser is introduced, due to the variation of the peak intensity, this time

constant is modiﬁed. We deﬁne two similar time constants, at the maximum intensity
(t = tP ), and at the edges of the time window (t = tP ±
the vicinity of the instantaneous crossing points RL, Rmin, Rmax:

τC), characterizing the dynamics in

As a generalization, following Ref.[42], we shall also use a local time-dependent Rabi period

deﬁned by

Obviously the pulse duration τC is also an important characteristic of the pulse. For the

discussion of the adiabaticity condition, and for the optimization of the pulse, it is interesting

to evaluate the time constant associated with the energy range swept during the time window

Therefore the frequency band swept by the central frequency due to the chirp is never

IV. AN EXAMPLE OF NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS FOR PHOTOASSOCIA-

TION WITH A CHIRPED PULSE.

Since the pulse depends upon many parameters, the way of optimizing them is not

straightforward. We give results of numerical calculations in the example already presented

in Section II A of photoassociation into several bound levels in the external well of the Cs2

The time scales associated with the radiation are reported in Table II. They appear to

be of the same order of magnitude: in particular, Tchirp and Tspect are similar, since for the

present pulse, the resonance width 2

the photoassociated levels in the external well of the 0−

evolution of the system at much shorter time scales. Through incertainty relations, it

9193 MHz will not be considered in the present paper, but it has a signiﬁcant value at the

time scale of the problem.

At resonance (∆ = 0) and for a cw laser, the intensity of the pulse would correspond to a

Rabi period of 22.5 ps. However, due to the streching factor τC/τL reducing the maximum

intensity, it is increased to 34.3 ps at t = tP . In the wings of the pulse, this time constant is
further increased, reaching the value 137 ps at the times tP ±

For the excited potential Vexc(R), the outer well in the 0−

ab initio calculations at short and intermediate range. The lower triplet state potential

in Table II. The energy diﬀerence reaches large values at short distances, yielding a

very small local Rabi period of 0.18 ps at R= 15 a0. The instantaneous crossing point

(deﬁned by ∆(R, t) = 0) varies with time, and we have indicated in the Figure the

values Rmin=85, RL=93.7 and Rmax=107.4 a0 deﬁned above in Eqs.(31) and discussed

in Section II B 4. Such distances are close to the outer turning points of the vibrational

levels v=92, 98 and 106 respectively,

for which Table III displays parameters such as

binding energies and vibrational periods. The pulse with negative chirp value described
in Table I has an intantaneous frequency resonant with the v=106 level at t = tP −
with v=98 at t = tP , and v=92 at t = tP + τC. Alternatively, when the chirp becomes

The classical vibrational period has no meaning for the last level, since the wavefunction

mainly extends in the classically forbidden region. We should note the very high value

of the time delay in the present problem, due to the large value of the scattering length,

demonstrates the strongly resonant character of the collision, and makes the collision time

by far the largest characteristic time in the problem. Looking at Tables IV and II, we see

B. Description of the initial state

The initial continuum state is represented by a stationary wavefunction in the ground

state potential curve and describing the collision of two cold Cs atoms at the energy kT

corresponding to T = 54.3 µK . It is chosen with a node at the external boundary LR of

the spatial grid (see below). This wavefunction is drawn in Fig. 3, together with a typical

gaussian wavepacket, showing how unlocalized is the initial state in the present work. This

is an important modiﬁcation compared to previous calculations [31, 36] using a gaussian

wavepacket: the population transfer can occur in a very wide range of internuclear distances,

17

well outside the resonance window, and in particular at large internuclear distances where

a large density probability is localized. No velocity distribution is considered in the present

work, this eﬀect being treated in paper II.

C. Numerical methods

Details on the numerical calculations will also be given in paper II: they involve mapped

grid methods [37] to represent the radial wavefunctions, using a sine expansion [38] rather

than the usual Fourier expansion, in order to avoid the occurrence of ghost states. The

introduction of adaptive coordinates is necessary to implement a spatial grid with few points

(1023), but with a large extension LR = 19250 a0 allowing representation of initial continuum

states at ultra-low collision energy. Due to the large size of the grid, and the very small

kinetic energy of the problem, it is not necessary to put an absorbing boundary condition at

the edge of the grid. Since the initial state wavefunction is normalized in a box, the results

given below will be depending on the value chosen for LR.

The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation is solved by expanding the evolution operator
i ˆHt/¯h] in Chebyschev polynomia [48]. The time propagation is realized by discrete

exp[

−

steps with a time increase much shorter than the characteristic times of the problem, already

discussed in Sec. III A and reported in the Tables II-IV. In the present problem, the smallest

time scale is the local Rabi period at small distances,

D. Results

All the numerical results presented below are obtained from an initial state wavefunction

normalized to unit in a large box of size LR=19250 a0. They correspond to branching ratios

of the photoassociation process towards diﬀerent ﬁnal vibrational levels, eigenstates of the

Hamiltonian for the unperturbed molecule. Due to the linear character of the Schr¨odinger

equation, the population transferred to a given level is proportional to the normalization

factor for the initial state. Therefore, in order to deduce the populations corresponding

computed populations should be multiplied by the density of states dn/dE=1/(8.87

to an energy-normalized initial continuum state, for E= 1.71

×

×

Besides, since the calculations concern only one pair of atoms, and are not velocity averaged,

the values for Pe(t) should be scaled to get an estimation of the population transfer due to

a single pulse in a trap containing N atoms: this will be done in Section VII.

The results of the calculations for the time-dependence of the populations are presented in

Fig. 5, both for a negative and a positive linear chirp parameter. The main conclusions are:

•

There is a population transfer from the ground 3Σ+

Calculations considering the same laser pulse with an initial state represented by a

gaussian wavepacket normalized to unity yield a much larger value (

and the probability density in the range 85

the predominant contribution of the resonance window.

is independent of the sign of the chirp. The population transfers towards bound levels
of the excited 0−

g and of the ground 3Σ+

u state are comparable.

•

While many bound levels in the excited 0−

g potential are excited during the pulse,
essentially the levels from v= 92 till v= 106 remain populated after the pulse (see Fig.

5e). They correspond to the range of energy around v= 98 swept by the laser during

the time window and presented above as a “resonance window”.

•

•

In contrast, highly excited levels from v=122 to v = 137 are signiﬁcantly populated

during the pulse (see Fig. 5e), but the population vanishes at the end of the pulse.

Whereas the oscillatory pattern during the time window markedly depends upon the

sign of the chirp, the ﬁnal population in the excited state, as well as the vibrational

distribution, is nearly independent upon this sign.

Such results demonstrate the existence of a “photoassociation window” including all the

levels in the energy range between v= 92 and v= 106 where population transfer is taking

place. We shall provide interpretation for this result in the following section.

V. A TWO-STATE MODEL FOR ADIABATIC POPULATION INVERSION.

A.

Impulsive approximation.

For all the following developments, we shall use the impulsive approximation [33], as-

suming that the relative motion of the two nuclei is frozen during the pulse duration. The

B. The adiabatic basis

When the impulsive approximation is valid, diagonalization of the hamiltonian ˆHi(R, t)

at each distance R will deﬁne a new representation, in the framework of a standard radiation-

20

driven two-level system [42, 49]. In Eqs.(47), the notations W and ∆ are similar to the ones

used in the textbook by Cohen-Tannoudji et al [50] to describe a two-state model. Deﬁning

a time-dependent local Rabi frequency

diagonalization of ˆHi yields two eigenenergies E+ and E−

Let us emphasize that in the adiabatic following of an instantaneous eigenstate of the

system, since the angle θi stays strictly equal either to 0 or π, the population in the ground or

in the excited state does not depend upon the accumulated phase α(R, t). This is not valid
when sin θi 6

mulated angle α(R, t). The latter situation requires that the laser ﬁeld is turned on suddenly.

The population inversion condition deﬁnes a range of distances where photoassoci-

ation is taking place, equivalent to the resonance window deﬁned above in Eqs.

(31).

However, the validity of such an interpretation relies upon the validity of the adiabatic ap-

proximation both inside and outside the window, and of the choice for the temporal window.

The conclusions are independent of the sign of the chirp, which is no longer true when

non-adiabatic eﬀects are involved.

VI. ADIABATICITY REGIME IN THE PHOTOASSOCIATION WINDOW AND

CONDITION TO AVOID RABI CYCLING AT LONG RANGE

A. The adiabaticity condition

From Eq.(52), we see that the system will present an adiabatic evolution provided the

non-diagonal term is negligible compared to the energy diﬀerence (E+ −

E−):

(65)

From Eq.

(50) we may derive ∂θ/∂t = [∆(dW/dt)

W (∂∆/∂t)]/[(¯hΩ)2]). From Eqs.

(28,29), the time-derivatives of the coupling term W (t) and of the level-splitting ∆(R, t) are

easily derived, leading to the explicit form of the condition (65),

that we wrote as an inequality between two quantities with the dimension of an energy-

square. The quantity in the left-hand side becomes large in the wings of the pulse (when

dW/dt is large), far from resonance (when ∆(R, t)) is large) and for a large value of the chirp

rate χ. The quantity in the right-hand side is the smallest at the instantaneous crossing

point RC(t) such that ∆(RC, t) = 0, where ¯hΩ(RC, t) = W (t).

The condition (66) takes simple forms if one chooses particular values of R or t:

1. At t = tP , when the coupling reaches the maximum Wmax = WL

if we consider the time window

B. Validity range of the adiabaticity condition

We shall ﬁrst ensure that, during the temporal window, the adiabaticity condition is

indeed valid all across the photoassociation window, deﬁned both by Eq. (31) and by the

relation (61) in which τF = τC. Then we shall check that no population transfer is occuring

outside the window, therefore justifying the deﬁnition of a window.

Finally, it is instructive to rewrite the condition (73) in terms of the time scales T L

Tchirp, introduced above in Eqs.(34,37), as well as the width τL or the time scale Tspect

associated to the spectral width of the pulse through Eq.(38):

Optimizing the adiabaticity condition requires the increase of the intensity of the pulse or

the reduction either of the photoassociation window (large value of Tchirp) or of the spectral

width of the pulse (large value of τL or Tspect). Since the population transfer will depend

upon the width of the photoassociation window, a compromise has to be chosen.

26

2. Adiabaticity in the asymptotic region

It is often convenient to ensure that no population is transferred outside the photoasso-

ciation window, in the region of distances where the two dressed curves never cross during

the time interval (t

VII. DISCUSSION

From the simple model developped above, we shall analyse further the numerical results

of Sec. IV.

A. Analysis of the numerical results in the framework of the two-state model

First, we have represented in Fig.6 the variation of the local frequency Ω(R, t), deﬁned

in Eq.(48), as a function of R for three choices of the time t = tP , tP ±
range minimum in Ω(R, t) moves from Rmax = 110 a0 to Rmin =85 a0 during the temporal

window [

35, +35] ps. Such minima occur at the distances where the local time-dependent

−

energy splitting ∆(R, t) goes through 0, as illustrated in Fig.4, and therefore deﬁne the

photoassociation window. Further minima in the local frequency occur at shorter range,

corresponding to inner crossings of the two dressed curves which do not play a role in

the photoassociation process, since the amplitude of the initial wavefunction

|
is negligible at such distances. Also indicated in Fig.6a are the values of the local Rabi

Ψinit(R)

|

period at time t = tP , further illustrating the wide range of variation with R, from 12 ps

at inﬁnity to 34 ps at RL, with very small values (0.18 ps) and larger ones (28 ps) at short

27

range where the two curves part and cross again. This behaviour is linked to the particular

shape of the potential curves, with a double well behaviour for the excited one. Looking at

Fig. 6b, it is clear that due to the reduction of the pulse intensity in the wings, reducing
τC, the minima in Ω(R, tP ±

of the time window, multiplying the Rabi frequency by a factor of 4. This is why it will

τC) are deeper at the borders

be diﬃcult to verify the adiabaticity condition at the borders of the time window and the

photoassociation window.

When the adiabatic approximation is valid, the impulsive two-state model described in

Sec. V predicts population inversion within a photoassociation window characterized by a
change of π between the angle θ(R, tP −
deﬁned in Eq. (50). The variation of the angle θ(R, t) as a function of R is represented in

τC) and the angle θ(R, tP + τC), where θ(R, t) is

Fig.7 for the same three choices of the time. We see that in a range of distances extending
from 85 to 110 a0, θ varies approximately by π from tP −
inversion can indeed be predicted.

τC till tP + τC: a population

The rather good agreement between numerical calculations and the predictions of a simple

two-state model seems to indicate that the adiabatic approximation is indeed valid in our

problem. In order to get more insight, we have studied the variations of the adiabaticity

parameter X(R, t) deﬁned above in Eq.71, which are represented in Fig. 8.

The adiabaticity parameter takes maximum values at the border of the time window (t =

B. Discussion

It is instructive at this stage to reﬁne our interpretation of the numerical results

presented above in Fig.5. Due to the coupling by the laser, vibrational levels in the 0−

g (P3/2)

are excited. We shall call “resonant levels” the v=92-106 levels, corresponding to the

range of energy swept by the instantaneous frequency ω(t) during the time window, and

“oﬀ-resonance levels” the other ones, corresponding to energies swept by the wings of the

spectral distribution during the time window, or by the whole spectral distribution outside

of the time window. Among them, excited levels are numerous, such as the v=122-137

range, due to the high density of levels close to the dissociation limit, and to the good

Franck-Condon overlap with the initial state.

When the chirp is negative, the instantaneous crossing point is moving from Rmax to Rmin,

so that the most excited levels are populated ﬁrst. This is illustrated for the “resonant

levels” in Fig.5(c). In contrast, for a positive chirp, since the resonance window is swept

from Rmin to Rmax, the lower levels are populated ﬁrst, as illustrated for the resonant levels

in Fig.5(f).

For the “oﬀ resonance” levels in the excited state, a maximum in the population Pv(t)

29

(see Eq. 46) appears, independently of the level, 4.45 ps before tP for χ < 0, and 4.45 ps

after tP for χ > 0 (Fig.5(e)). A quantitative evaluation of this advance (resp. delay) can

be obtained from analysis of the adiabatic population transfer at large distance R

angle θ(R, t) and the accumulated angle α(R, t) are independent of R. Furthermore the

vibrational wavefunction in the excited potential curve is strongly localized in the asymptotic

region. Therefore the time-dependence of the population Pe(t) as deﬁned in Eq.(45) scales as

(77)

which gives -4.37 ps for the present pulse with negative chirp, and explains the symmetry

when changing to a positive chirp. The excellent agreement between this estimation and

the

4.45 ps value found in numerical calculations is a signature of the validity both of

±

the adiabatic approximation and of the impulsive approximation in the asymptotic region.

Indeed, the vibrational period for levels v > 122 is Tvib(v)

780 ps. The maximum is also

≥

visible in the variation of total population in Fig.5(b), therefore dominated by asymptotic

excitation.

For the “resonant” levels, oscillations in Pv(t) appear only for the levels which come

to resonance with the instantaneous frequency ω(t) before the maximum of the pulse, at

a time tC(v) such that tC(v) < tP . For χ < 0, oscillations are therefore observed for the

highest levels, like v=107 and 102 in Fig.5(c). For χ > 0, the population of the lowest

levels, like v=95 in Fig.5(f) is oscillating. For the v=98 level, resonant at the maximum

of the pulse, the time-dependence of the population does not depend upon the sign of the

chirp (red curve in Fig.5(c,f)), and oscillates weakly. Such oscillations are a signature of

signiﬁcant non-adiabatic eﬀects in the population transfer at the instantaneous crossing
point around t = tP −
most diﬃcult to verify at the instantaneous crossing point and in the wings of the pulse.

τC. We have shown in Sec.VI how the adiabaticity criterion is

Away from the adiabatic regime, the passage through resonance does not lead to a total

population transfer: coherent excitation of a two-level system with linearly chirped pulses

30

results in “coherent transients” previously studied in the perturbative limit [49, 51, 52].

Such transients are governed by interferences between the population amplitude transferred

at resonance t = tC(v), and population amplitude transferred after, for t > tC(v). The latter

amplitude is signiﬁcant provided the maximum of the pulse occurs after the resonance,

so that tP > tC(v), resulting into the observed oscillations. The values of the observed

periods can correspond to a Rabi period at the instantaneous crossing point:

for v=98,

resonant at t = tP , the period of 36 ps is close to τRab(RL, tP )= 34 ps; for the level v=102

with a negative chirp, or v=95 with a positive chirp, the 25 ps period is associated to a π

variation of the accumulated angle α(R, t) calculated at R distances corresponding to the

outer turning points of these vibrational levels.

Looking back to the derivation of the equations describing adiabatic transfer in Sec.V,

we see that in the case when sin θi 6

The total population at a given R value in the excited channel therefore exhibits

Rabi oscillations, with a time period corresponding to a π variation of the accumulated

angle α(R, t). The modulation rates appearing in Fig.5(c) for the high resonant vibrational
levels with large vibrational periods Tvib ∼
a negative chirp, are much larger than those observed in Fig.5(f) for the low resonant
vibrational levels, with Tvib ∼
oscillations being manifested in cases where the vibrational period is much larger than the

200 ps, the ﬁrst populated with a positive chirp. Rabi

350 ps, which are the ﬁrst populated with

Rabi period, a frailty in the impulsive approximation can be supposed for levels for which

these two characteristic times become comparable. Besides, as discussed by Banin et al

(1994) [33], the wavepacket created in the excited state being accelerated towards short

internuclear distances, the breakdown of the impulsive approximation is more severe for

31

χ < 0 than for χ > 0. Indeed, for χ < 0, the instantaneous frequency of the laser remains

resonant during the motion of the wavepacket and then recycles the population back to

ground state [35].

Therefore, the simple model for two-state adiabatic population inversion, developped in the

impulsive limit, allows a qualitative interpretation of the numerical results. In particular,

the vibrational levels in the excited state where population remains transferred after the

pulse are well predicted by this model. Also is the weak dependence of the ﬁnal population

as a function of the sign of the chirp. However, the phase of the probability amplitude on

each level is not independent of the sign of the chirp, so that after the pulse the vibrational

wavepacket evolves in a very diﬀerent way for positive and for negative chirp. Furthermore,

detailed analysis of the numerical results indicates the limits of both the impulsive model

and the adiabatic population transfer.

VIII. APPLICATION: CONTROLLING THE FORMATION OF ULTRACOLD

MOLECULES VIA FOCUSSING AND IMPROVING PRESENT EXPERIMENTAL

SCHEMES

A. Focussed vibrational wavepacket

The pulse described in Table I, with negative linear chirp parameter χ, has been designed

in order to achieve focussing of the vibrational wavepacket at a time tP + Tvib/2, where

Tvib/2= 125 ps is half the vibrational period of the level v=98. The levels in the range

from approximately v=106 till v=92 are populated in turn, the chirp parameter necessary

to compensate the dispersion in the vibrational period of the wavepacket being chosen as

χ =

2πTrev/(Tvib)3, i.e. adjusted to match the revival period Trev (see Eq.(43)) of the
2πTrev(v0)/[Tvib(v0)]3, the amplitude

resonant level v=98. Indeed, for χ satisfying χv0 =

−

−

resonantly transferred at t = tC(v) creates a wavepacket at the outer turning point of each

vibrational level v

v0, which reaches the inner turning point at time t = tP + Tvib(v0)

≈

independently of v. The evolution of the wavepacket after the pulse has been computed,

and we have represented in Fig.9 a snapshot of the wavepacket in the excited state at time

tP + Tvib/2.

•

An important focussing eﬀect is visible for a negative chirp, the wavepacket presenting

32

a peak in the vicinity of the inner turning point of the v=98 level.

This eﬀect is reduced when a positive chirp is used, a large part of the population

being in the large distance region, due to the late excitation of the upper levels v=

98-107, with a much larger vibrational period.

When there is no chirp, the population transfer is much smaller, the factor

3 on the

≈

maximum amplitude resulting into one order of magnitude in the transfer probability
10 −4). Besides the wavepacket is no longer focussed since

10 −5 instead of 3.5

( 4

×

×

the levels that have been populated are no longer in the vicinity of v=98, but belong

to the domain v > 103 of very excited levels; from the behaviour of this wavepacket

it is clear, as illustrated in Fig.9(b), that the levels have a large vibrational period.

The distribution of vibrational levels is governed by the spectral width ¯hδω and by

the overlap integral between the initial and ﬁnal wavefunctions, which is dominant for

v

130.

≈

Focussing of the wavepacket on the inner classical turning point of the vibrational

levels will allow to consider population transfer towards bound levels of the ground

triplet state potential curve via a second laser, in a two colour pump-probe experiment.
It should then be possible to populate eﬃciently low v′′ levels in the ground state.

For such purpose, the optimization of the pulse can be achieved through analytical

formula, considering the revival period, and the scaling laws governing the dynamics

•

•

•

•

of long range molecules [4, 53].

B. Towards new experiments

A proper estimation of the photoassociation rate requires incoherent average over a ther-

mal distribution of energy normalized initial states. These energy-normalized continuum

wavefunctions are deduced from wavefunctions normalized to unit in the box of size LR,

accounting for the density of states in this box. Furthermore, following Ref.[26], for low

temperature, it is possible to estimate the photoassociation yield by assuming a weak vari-

ation of the population as a function of the initial energy. For an assembly of atoms in a
10−4 cm3, with density Nat=1011 cm−3, the number of molecules formed in

volume V = 5

×

33

one pulse under the conditions discussed in the present paper is 0.690. With a repetition

rate of 108 Hz, the yield is 6.9

107 molecules per second, which is signiﬁcant larger that

rates obtained with continuous lasers [4].

IX. CONCLUSION

The present theoretical paper has investigated the possibility oﬀered by replacing con-

tinuous lasers by chirped laser pulses in ultracold photoassociation experiments. We have

performed and analyzed numerical calculations of the population transfer due to a chirped

≈

54µK) of the ground triplet state Cs2 a3Σ+

pulse, from a continuum state (T
to high excited vibrational levels in the external well of the 0−
g (6s + 6p3/2) potential. The
central frequency of the pulse was chosen resonant with the level v=98 of the 0−
g external
well, bound by 2.65 cm−1. We have used a pulse with gaussian envelope, having a peak
10−3 ps−2, and temporal
intensity IL ≈
0.87 cm−1
width τC = 34.8 ps. Due to the linear chirp parameter, a range of energy of 2

120 kW cm−2, a linear chirp parameter of -4.79

u (6s + 6s),

×

is swept by the laser frequency, corresponding to resonance with 15 vibrational levels in the

vicinity of v= 98, and referred to as “resonance window”. The spectral width of the pulse,
0.98 cm−1on

which remains independent of the chirp, covers a typical range of energies of

×

∼

both sides.

The initial state of two colliding ultracold cesium atoms is represented by a continuum

stationary wavefunction, with a realistic scattering length and nodal structure. This is

possible owing to use of a mapped sine grid method recently developed by Willner et al

[38]. The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation is solved through expansion in Chebyschev

polynomia [48].

Due to the large value of the scattering length, the initial wavefunction has a large

density probability at large distances, resulting into a large Franck-Condon overlap with

vibrational levels in the excited state close to the dissociation limit. Numerical calculations

show that, during the pulse, a large amount of population is indeed transferred to levels

close to the Cs2 (6s + 6p3/2) dissociation limit: however, with the particular choice of the

chirp, we have shown that this population is going back to the ground state after the pulse.

In contrast, the 15 levels within the photoassociation window are coherently populated,

and part of the population remains after the pulse. The same conclusion is obtained by

34

changing the sign of the chirp. Besides, an interesting result is that, due to the coupling at

large distances between the two electronic states, a strong population transfer to the last

vibrational levels of the ground a3Σ+

u (6s + 6s) is realized, making stable molecules with a

rate as important as for the photoassociation into the excited state. This result should be

further explored.

The interpretation of the strong population transfer towards the 15 levels in the resonance

window, independent of the sign of the chirp, is given within the impulsive limit, in the

framework of a two-state adiabatic population inversion model. The numerical results can

be qualitatively and even quantitatively interpreted by this model, deﬁning the conditions

for full population transfer within a “photoassociation window” covering a range of distances
85 a0 ≤
of controlling the population transfer towards the excited state, ensuring that no transfer

the time window” requires that the coupling should be larger than a quantity proportional

to the geometric average between the energy range swept by the instantaneous frequency of

the chirped pulse and its spectral energy width. To keep adiabaticity, a compromise between

increasing the laser intensity and decreasing the width of the photoassociation window must

therefore be found, and it can be discussed within the model we propose. Even though in

the present calculations the adiabaticity condition is veriﬁed within the photoassociation

window, a few non adiabatic eﬀects were identiﬁed and interpreted. Further work will

estimate more thoroughly the lower limit for intensity.

As an example of control, the present pulse has been chosen in order to achieve focussing

of the excited vibrational wavepacket at the inner turning point of the v=98 level, at a time

delay after the pulse maximum equal to half the classical vibrational period Tvib(v = 98).

The relevant chirp parameter was optimised from the revival time. Such calculations suggest

a scheme for a two colour experiment where a second pulse, delayed by Tvib/2, would transfer
photoassociation population to low v′′ levels of the ground triplet state, now forming stable

molecules in low vibrational levels.

35

In a forthcoming paper, we shall give more quantitative results for comparison with

experiment by averaging on the initial state velocity distribution to compute the photoasso-

ciation rate for a series of pulses with a variable repetition rate, considering diﬀerent choices

of the ﬁnal vibrational levels by varying the detuning, and diﬀerent laser intensities. We

shall propose various schemes to optimize the eﬃciency of the population transfer, taking

advantage of the conclusion of the present paper where we have shown that it is possible

to design chirped laser pulses so that the photoassociation reaction is restricted to a well

deﬁned window.

From the present calculations it is already possible to conclude that photoassociation

with a chirped laser pulse is a very promising scheme. In the present example where the
peak intensity of the laser was chosen IL ≈
molecules per second in typical experimental conditions is deﬁnitely larger than what has

120 kW cm−2, the estimated rate of

been computed and measured for cw lasers. Since the present calculations were performed

in a frequency domain close to a photoassociation minimum, much higher rates are to be

expected by varying the detuning, and this will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.

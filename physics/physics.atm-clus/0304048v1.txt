We apply a hard-core version of the Faddeev differential equations to the 3He4He2 three-
atomic system. Employing the TTY interatomic potential by Tang, Toennies and Yiu we
calculate the binding energy of the 3He4He2 trimer and the scattering length of a 3He atom
off a 4He dimer.

INTRODUCTION

Small Helium clusters attract a lot of attention in various ﬁelds of physical chemistry and
molecular physics. There is a great number of experimental and theoretical studies of the 4He
three-atomic system (see, e. g., [1]– [13] and references cited therein). The non-symmetric system
3He4He2 found comparatively little attention. To the best of our knowledge the 3He4He2 trimers
were studied numerically only in Refs. [5], [7], [12], [14]. Except Ref. [14], there are still no
scattering calculations reported for this system.

The present work is a sequel to the investigation of the helium three-atomic systems undertaken
[8], [10], [15] based on a mathematically rigorous hard-core version of the Faddeev
in Refs.
differential equations. This method allows one to overcome in particular the strong-repulsion

problem arising in examination of atomic systems. Along the same line we now investigate the
3He4He2 bound states as well as the scattering of a 3He atom off a 4He dimer at ultra-low energies.
For the moment we restrict ourselves to the use of the TTY interatomic He–He potential by
Tang, Toennies and Yiu [17]. Computations with other realistic He–He interactions are in progress
and will be reported elsewhere.

II. METHOD

In this section we only describe the main features of the method employed. Further technical

details can be found in [8], [10], [15].

It is assumed that the 3He4He2 three-atomic system is in the state with the total angular mo-
mentum L = 0. Then the partial angular analysis reduces the initial hard-core Faddeev equations
(see, e.g., [8]) to a system of coupled two-dimensional integro-differential equations

III. RESULTS

First, we employed the equations (1) – (3) and the corresponding bound-state asymptotic
boundary conditions to calculate the binding energy of the helium trimer 3He4He2. Recall that
in this work as a He-He interaction we used the TTY potential by Tang, Toennies and Yiu [17]. As

in [8], [10], [15] we used a ﬁnite-difference approximation of the boundary-value problem (1)–(3)
x2 + y2 and q = arctan(y/x). The grids were chosen such that the

points of intersection of the arcs r = r
j, j = 1, 2, . . ., Nq with
the core boundary x = c constitute the knots. The value of the core radius was chosen to be c = 1 ˚A
by the same argument as in [10]. Also the idea for choosing the grid radii r
i (and, thus, the grid
hyperangles q

i, i = 1, 2, . . ., Nr and the rays q = q

j) was the same as described in [10].

We assumed that ¯h2/m = 12.12 K ˚A2 where m stands for the mass of a 4He atom. The mass
ratio m3He/m4He was assumed to be equal to 0.753517. Notice that for the TTY potential the
4He-dimer energy is 1.30962 mK [10].

The best dimensions of the grids which we employed in this investigation were Nr = 600 and
Nq = 605 with cut-off hyperradius r max = 200 ˚A. Our results for the 3He4He2 binding energy
obtained for a grid with such Nr , Nq , and r max, as well as the results available in the literature,
are presented in Table I. Is is found that most of the contribution to the binding energy stems
from the l = 0 and 1 ≤ l ≤ 2 partial components, about 53% and 42%, respectively. The overall
contribution from the l = 3 and l = 4 partial wave components is of the order of 5 %. A certain
(but rather small) deepening of the 3He4He2 binding energy may also be expected due to choosing
the grids with larger Nq and Nr .

Being a more light particle than 4He, the 3He atom does not form a bound molecule with the
4He counterpart and no 3He dimer exists. As a consequence, 3He4He2 is a more loosely bound
system than the 4He trimer (see, e.g. [8] and [10]). In partiuclar, there is no exited state of the
3He4He2 system in contrast to the symmetric 4He3 trimer that is well known to have an exited
state of Eﬁmov nature.

Our results for the 3He–4He2 scattering length calculated also for a grid with Nr = 600, Nq =

605, and r max = 200 ˚A are shown in Table II.

Heat capacities of NaN , N = 13, 20, 55, 135, 142, and 147, clusters have been investigated using
a many-body Gupta potential and microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations. Negative heat
capacities around the cluster melting-like transition have been obtained for N = 135, 142, and 147,
but the smaller clusters (N = 13, 20, and 55) do not show this peculiarity. By performing a survey of
the cluster potential energy landscape (PEL), it is found that the width of the distribution function
of the kinetic energy and the spread of the distribution of potential energy minima (isomers), are
useful features to determine the diﬀerent behavior of the heat capacity as a function of the cluster
size. The eﬀect of the range of the interatomic forces is studied by comparing the heat capacities of
the Na55 and Cd55 clusters. It is shown that by decreasing the range of the many-body interaction,
the distribution of isomers characterizing the PEL is modiﬁed appropriately to generate a negative
heat capacity in the Cd55 cluster.

INTRODUCTION

Negative microcanonical heat capacity in atomic and
molecular clusters was theoretically predicted by consid-
ering simple models of the distribution of local minima
that characterize the potential energy landscape (PEL)
of clusters1.
In that study, it was found that for high
values of the parameter involving the ratios of the vibra-
tional frequencies corresponding to the global and local
isomers, the caloric curve displays an S-shaped loop, with
a negative heat capacity in the vicinity of the melting
point1.
In another study on the solid-liquid transition
of clusters2, it was shown that in microcanonical sim-
ulations of Lennard-Jones clusters, an increase in total
energy causes a temperature reduction. This eﬀect was
related to the broadening of the cluster kinetic-energy
distribution toward lower energy values2.

Although the existence of negative heat capacity in
physical systems like stars or star clusters3,4, and in
fragmenting nuclei5,6 is well-known, this peculiar eﬀect
gained a lot of interest in the ﬁeld of atomic and molec-
ular clusters due to recent experimental results where
a negative heat capacity was measured for a 147-atom
sodium cluster7. In this study, the photofragmentation
mass spectra was used to measure the internal energy
of free, mass selected clusters with known temperature.
These measurements were used to determine the micro-
canonical caloric curve of the Na+
147 that shows the char-
acteristic S-shaped (backbending) feature, indicating a
negative heat capacity7. The negative value of the mi-
crocanonical heat capacity was interpreted by consider-
ing that a ﬁnite system upon melting tries to avoid partly
molten states and prefers to convert some of its kinetic
energy into potential energy7,8. This peculiarity has been
attributed to the non-additivity of the total energy of a
cluster with ﬁnite size7,8.

Microcanonical heat capacities of metal clusters
have been theoretically investigated using constant-

energy molecular dynamics
(MD) with many-body
potentials9,10,11 and an orbital-free version of the ﬁrst-
principles MD method12,13. In these studies, heat capac-
ities of fcc transition and noble metal clusters with up to
23 atoms were calculated to characterize their melting-
like transition9.
In another study, on the melting of
sodium clusters10, the microcanonical caloric curve of
the Na55 cluster was obtained. However, in not one of
these studies was a signature of a negative heat capac-
ity found. Similar results, indicating the non-existence of
a negative heat capacity in constant-energy orbital-free
ﬁrst-principles MD simulations of larger sodium clusters
(Na55, Na92, and Na142), were obtained13. Nevertheless,
in such calculations the simulation time employed was
too short to obtain converged results13. On the other
hand, in microcanonical MD simulations of AlN , N = 7,
13, 55, and 147, clusters, a negative heat capacity was
obtained for the larger Al147 cluster11.

In the present work, motivated by the availability of ex-
perimental techniques that allow the measurement of the
microcanonical heat capacity and other thermal proper-
ties of mass selected metal clusters14,15,16, we theoret-
ically investigate the behavior of the heat capacity of
sodium clusters in the size range of 13-147 atoms.
In
our approach, constant-energy MD simulations are per-
formed using a phenomenological many-body potential
that mimics the metallic bonding of sodium clusters.
This approximation allows us to use simulation times
of the order of ∼ 50 ns, in order to obtain converged
averages of the microcanonical heat capacity and other
cluster thermal properties. Our main objective is to gain
additional insights into the conditions that determine if
a cluster has a negative heat capacity. The main ﬁnd-
ing of this work shows that the width of the distribution
function of the kinetic energy and the spread of the dis-
tribution of the potential energy minima (isomers), char-
acterizing the PEL, are useful features to determine the
signature of the cluster heat capacity. In section II, we

provide the theoretical background on which this study
is based. The results and their discussion are given in
section III, and section IV contains a summary and the
conclusions of this work.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

The heat capacity and temperature of sodium clusters
as a function of the cluster total energy are calculated
through constant-energy MD simulations using the mi-
crocanonical expressions derived in Refs. 17,18:

C
N kB

=

N − N (1 −

3N − 6

)hKihK −1i
(cid:21)

−1

T =

2hKi
(3N − 6)kB

,

where K is the kinetic energy of the cluster, kB is the
Boltzmann constant, and h...i denotes a time average.
In these formulas, 3N was changed to 3N -6, the num-
ber of degrees of freedom of the system, since the cal-
culations are performed for a non-translating and non-
rotating cluster in a three-dimensional space (the posi-
tion of the center of mass was ﬁxed and the total mo-
mentum was held to zero during the simulations).

In our implementation of the constant-energy MD
method, the Newton’s equations of motion are solved
with the Verlet algorithm19 using a time step of 2.4 fs,
which provides total energy conservation within 0.001
%. A typical calculation consists in heating up a clus-
ter from its lowest-energy solid-like conﬁguration until
it transforms into a liquid-like cluster. To simulate this
procedure the cluster total energy is increased in a step-
like manner by scaling up the atomic velocities. For each
initial condition the cluster was equilibrated during 104
time steps and the time averages of the physical quanti-
ties are calculated using 107 time steps. This averaging
time is increased by a factor of 2 when the cluster is in the
region of the solid-to-liquid transition in order to ensure
the calculation of fully converged averages.

To model the metallic bonding in sodium clusters we
used the many-body Gupta potential20, which is based
on the second moment approximation of a tight-binding
hamiltonian21. Its analytical expression is given by:

V =

where r0, A, ξ, p, and q are adjustable parameters21.
For sodium clusters these parameters have been ﬁt-
ted to band structure calculations22. Their values are:

2

A=0.01595 eV, ξ=0.29113 eV, r0=6.99 bohr, p=10.13,
and q=1.3022. This phenomelogical many-body poten-
tial has been used to study the melting-like transition
in sodium clusters of diﬀerent sizes using Monte Carlo
(MC)10 and constant-energy MD simulations23. A good
qualitative agreement has been obtained between struc-
tural and thermal properties calculated using the Gupta
potential10,23 and those generated from ﬁrst-principles
methods12,13. An additional advantage in using this po-
tential is that it allows simulation times of the order of
50 ns, necessary to obtain fully converged time averages
in the melting-like transition region.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The microcanonical heat capacities of the NaN , N =
13, 20, 55, 135, 142, and 147, clusters, calculated using
Eq. (1), are displayed in Fig. 1. For N = 13, 20, and
55, they are continuous functions of the cluster total en-
ergy showing a maximum value that is characteristic of
a melting-like transition10,12,13,23. On the other hand,
the heat capacity of the larger clusters (N = 135, 142,
and 147) shows two discontinuity points and a continuous
negative-valued interval between them. This peculiar be-
havior in the heat capacity is related with a backbending
loop in the caloric curve (temperature as a function of the
total energy)1,2,24,25. In fact, our calculated microcanon-
ical caloric curves of Na135, Na142, and Na147 show the
backbending loop at the same energies where the heat ca-
pacity takes negative values (see the caloric curves shown
in Fig. 2 of Ref. 23). In previous studies, the negative
slope (backbending loop) of the microcanonical caloric
curve has been attributed to a peculiar behavior of the
cluster entropy as a function of energy that shows a dent
with inverted curvature in the region of the solid-liquid
transition1,2,7,8,25.

In the present work, we analyze the behavior of the
microcanonical heat capacity of sodium clusters from a
diﬀerent perspective. First, we consider Eq.
(1) and
obtain the condition to have a negative value in the heat
capacity:

ZE ≡ hKihK −1i >

(5)

3N − 6
3N − 8

.

(3)

(4)

Figure 2 display the values of ZE (black dots) as a func-
tion of the cluster total energy E that were calculated
from a time average, using the MD trajectories. In the
same scale the threshold value Zc ≡ (3N − 6)/(3N − 8)
for each cluster size is given. In Fig. 2 , it can be graph-
ically seen how the relative diﬀerence between ZE and
Zc changes with the cluster size. For the three smaller
clusters (see panels (a), (b), and (c) in Fig. 2 ) the ZE
values do not overcome the threshold value, whereas for
the three larger clusters there is a range of total energy
where ZE satisfy the condition to have negative heat ca-
pacities (see panels (d), (e), and (f) in Fig. 2 ).

3

(9)

In order to investigate what determines a negative
value of the heat capacity, we consider the quantity ZE.
This is the product of the averages of the kinetic energy
and of the inverse of this quantity, and therefore, its value
will depend on the distribution function of the kinetic en-
ergy, gE(K). The average of any function of the kinetic
energy f (K) can be obtained through the following ex-
pression:

The second moment of gE corresponds to the second term
in the expansion of ZE, which can be obtained from the
left hand term of Eq. (5)17,18:

ZE = 1 + h(δK)2ig + ....

By taking terms up to second order in this expansion,
assuming that hδKig << 1, ZE can be approximated by:

hfEig =

f (K)gE(K)dK.

Z

(6)

ZE ≈ Z (2)

E = 1 + h(δK)2ig.

Since the distribution function of the kinetic energy,
gE(K), determines the behavior of ZE, it is useful to
analyze gE(K) at diﬀerent values of the cluster total en-
ergy E. The calculation of this quantity is straightfor-
ward from the constant-energy MD simulations. Figure
3 shows gE as a function of the normalized mean devia-
tion δK = (K - hKi)/ hKi for three diﬀerent energies,
corresponding to the cases where the cluster is in the
solid- and liquid-like phases, and at the middle of the
melting-like transition. The analysis of gE as a function
of δK, instead of K, has the advantage that it allows
the comparison, on the same scale, of the lineshapes of
this function at diﬀerent cluster energies and for diﬀerent
cluster sizes.

As a general trend, it is found that gE becomes nar-
rower for increasing cluster sizes, indicating a larger rela-
tive dispersion of the kinetic energy values for the smaller
clusters. This result is expected since it conﬁrms the in-
crement of ﬂuctuations in kinetic energy of a physical
system that decrease in size. A common characteristic of
gE, existing in the six clusters investigated, is the larger
broadening of the distribution function when the clus-
ter is at the melting-like transition. At lower (solid-like
phase) and higher (liquid-like phase) energies, the width
of gE is smaller, whereas at the phase transition the ﬂuc-
tuations in kinetic energy, as expected, should increase.
For the three smaller clusters which do not have neg-
ative heat capacity, gE(δK) shows a nearly symmetric
lineshape independent of the cluster energy (see panels
(a), (b), and (c) of Fig. 3 ). In contrast, Na142 and Na147,
that show a negative heat capacity, have a distribution
function gE(δK) with a shoulder towards positive values
of δK, at energies in the middle of the melting region (see
panels (e) and (f) of Fig. 3 ). Although this diﬀerence in
the distribution function of the kinetic energy could be
a useful feature to determine the existence of a negative
heat capacity, the Na135 cluster would be an exception
to this rule since its gE(δK) does not show a resolved
shoulder in its lineshape (see panel (d) in Fig. 3), but it
has negative heat capacity.

On the other hand, a characteristic of gE that would
be useful to determine the sign of the heat capacity is the
width of the distribution function, which can be obtained
through its second moment:

h(δK)2ig =

(δK)2gE(δK)d(δK).

(7)

Z

Since the Z (2)
E values can be calculated using gE and Eq.
(7), it is possible to check the validity of this approxima-
tion, which can only be applied to systems with a ﬁnite
number of particles. Fig. 2 shows the values of Z (2)
E
(stars) as a function of the cluster energy. It can be seen
that the diﬀerence with ZE is small for the three smaller
clusters and negligible for the three larger ones. Then,
Z (2)
E can be considered as a quantitative measure of the
width (second moment) of the distribution function of the
kinetic energy, and can be used to determine the sign of
the heat capacity. Figure 4 shows the maximum values
of Z (2)
E (black dots) calculated for energies at the mid-
dle of the melting transition, and their comparison with
the threshold values Zc as a function of the cluster size
(full line). From this ﬁgure, it is obvious that although
the width of gE is relatively large for the three smaller
clusters, the corresponding maximum values of Z (2)
E are
below the threshold Zc, and therefore these clusters do
not show a negative heat capacity. On the other hand,
the width of gE for Na135, Na142, and Na147 is smaller
than for Na13, Na20, and Na55, however, Zc is a faster
decreasing function of the cluster size N , such that the
maximum of Z (2)
E lies above the threshold values, indi-
cating that the larger clusters have negative heat capac-
ities. Then, the above results suggest that the width of
the distribution function of the kinetic energy is a useful
property to determine the sign of the heat capacity of
clusters. However, this quantity not only depends on the
cluster size, but also on the characteristics of the PEL.

To illustrate the importance of the topology of the PEL
we have investigated the behavior of the heat capacity of
55-atom clusters using the many-body Gupta potential20,
shown in Eqs. (3) and (4), for the diﬀerent metals listed
in Tables I and III of Ref. 21, and in Table II of Ref.
22. Our results show that the Cd55 cluster (with the fol-
lowing parameter values21: A=0.0416 eV, ξ=0.4720 eV,
p=13.639, and q=3.908) has a negative heat capacity,
but none of the other 55-atom clusters show this pecu-
liarity. The upper insets of Fig. 4 show the calculated
caloric curve with the corresponding backbending loop
and the heat capacity with negative values for a range of
total energy values of the Cd55 cluster. The inset at the
lower right corner of Fig. 4 shows gE as a function of
the normalized mean deviation of the kinetic energy for
both, the Na55 and Cd55, clusters. It can be seen that
the broadening of gE is larger in Cd55 than in Na55, such

that, it generates a maximum value of Z (2)
E (this value
corresponds to the point represented by a star in Fig. 4)
that overcome the threshold Zc, and consequently, the
Cd55 cluster display a negative heat capacity. This com-
parison with the Na55 cluster which does not show this
peculiarity, indicates that although both clusters have
the same size, their dynamical properties deﬁned by their
corresponding PEL’s, generate diﬀerent behavior in their
heat capacities.

In order to investigate the inﬂuence of the PEL on the
diﬀerent widths of the distribution function of the kinetic
energy of the Na55 and Cd55 clusters, further studies are
necessary. In this direction, the calculation of short-time
averages of the kinetic energy and periodic quenchings of
instantaneous conﬁgurations during the MD trajectories
allow us to obtain the distribution of potential energy
minima (isomers) that are accessible at diﬀerent clus-
ter energies24. Figure 5 display the normalized distri-
bution of potential energy minima, obtained by period-
ical quenchings using MD trajectories at a total energy
where the cluster is at the middle of the melting transi-
tion, for the Na55 and Cd55 clusters. It can be notice that
the number of isomers with higher energy relative to the
global minimum, are larger for the Cd55 cluster in com-
parison with the results obtained for Na55. This result
can be explained by taking into account that the range
of the interatomic forces is shorter in Cd than in Na clus-
ters, mainly due to the higher value of the q parameter in
the many-body Gupta potential26. The physical reason
for the larger number of minima at short range is the loss
of accessible conﬁguration space as the potential wells be-
come narrower, thus producing barriers where there are
none at long range27.

To show how the distribution of potential energy min-
ima determine the broadening of the distribution func-
tion of the kinetic energy, we approximate the complex
topology of the PEL by a set of independent harmonic
potential wells in the 3N − 6 dimensional space. Each
one of these wells is associated to the diﬀerent potential
energy minima forming the distribution of isomers shown
in Fig. 5. For each potential energy minimum denoted
by l, the distribution function of the kinetic energy at a
total energy E, in the harmonic approximation, is given
by2,17:

gE,l(K) = Cl(E − ∆l − K)

2 K

3N −7

3N −7

,

(10)

where ∆l is the potential energy of the isomer l, relative
to the potential energy value of the lowest-energy isomer,
and Cl is a normalization constant such that:

E−∆l

Z
0

gE,l(K)dK = 1.

(11)

The distribution function of the kinetic energy gE,har, at
a total energy E, corresponding to the whole PEL can be
constructed by adding up the contribution of each har-
monic potential well, weighted by the probability, ωE,l,
of ﬁnding a given isomer during the quenching from the

lmax

Xl=1

lmax

Xl=1

MD trajectories. This probability is given by the height
of the distribution shown in Fig. 5. Then, gE,har is given
by:

gE,har =

ωE,l gE,l(K),

(12)

with

ωE,l = 1.

(13)

By using the data from the whole distribution of isomers
in Fig. 5, the distribution function of the kinetic energy
gE,har was calculated for the Cd55 and Na55 clusters.
They are displayed in the insets of Fig. 5 (full lines). A
comparison between gE,har and the exact gE (obtained
from the MD simulation and displayed in the lower right
inset of Fig. 4) shows that there is a good agreement be-
tween the two distribution functions. This indicates that
gE is determined mainly from the number of isomers and
the probability to found them (height of the distribu-
tion), rather than from other features of the PEL like
saddle points. The advantage in introducing gE,har in
this discussion is related with the fact that it is possible
to analyze the broadening of this distribution function
of the kinetic energy by considering diﬀerent subsets of
potential energy minima (isomers). This is useful to de-
termine what regions of the PEL are more relevant to
increase the width of gE,har, and investigate the appear-
ance of the negative heat capacity. The insets of Fig. 5
show three partial distribution functions gE,har, consid-
ering diﬀerent subsets of isomers corresponding to three
intervals of low (L), medium (M) and high (H) potential
energy values. By analyzing the relative contribution of
these subsets to the width of gE,har for the Cd55 and
Na55 clusters, it is found that the larger broadening in
the cadmium cluster is mainly due to the larger contribu-
tion of the isomers in the range of high potential energy
which are spreaded along a larger interval than those cor-
responding to the Na55 cluster. The width of gE,har for
the Na55 cluster is smaller since there are proportion-
ally less isomers with high potential energy, and they are
extended over a shorter interval of values. As was men-
tioned above, the physical reason for this diﬀerence in the
distribution of isomers between the Cd55 and Na55 clus-
ters is the shorter range of the many-body forces existing
in the cadmium cluster as compared with those present
in the sodium cluster. A similar result was obtained for
55-atom clusters using a pairwise Morse potential for dif-
ferent values of the range of the interatomic forces27. In
that case the backbending loop in the caloric curve (neg-
ative heat capacity) was obtained using a Morse poten-
tial with a range of the interatomic forces that is shorter
than the range characteristic of alkali metals which have
long-ranged interactions27.

Therefore, if a detailed characterization of the distribu-
tion of isomers forming the PEL of clusters is performed,

the broadening of gE may be estimated, and by the com-
parison of the corresponding Z (2)
E and Zc values, it would
be possible to predict the sign of the heat capacity of
clusters.

IV. SUMMARY

The microcanonical heat capacity of sodium clusters
has been calculated using constant-energy MD simula-
tions and the many-body Gupta potential. Negative val-
ues for the heat capacity at energies where the cluster
is at the melting-like transition were found for Na135,
Na142, and Na147. The smaller sodium clusters NaN ,
N =13, 20, and 55, do not show this peculiarity. An
analysis of the calculated distribution function of the ki-
netic energy gE for the six clusters investigated, shows
that the width of this distribution function is a useful
feature to determine the sign of the heat capacity.
It
was found, that although the broadening of gE is larger
for the smaller clusters, it is not enough to overcome the
corresponding threshold value to obtain a negative heat
capacity. However, since this threshold is a fast decreas-

5

ing function of the cluster size, the broadening of gE in
the larger clusters is enough to generate a negative heat
capacity.

It was also shown that the broadening of gE depends
on the distribution of potential energy minima that char-
acterize the PEL of clusters. Speciﬁcally, as the range of
the many-body interactions is decreased (like in the case
of Cd clusters), the number of local minima with higher
energy increases generating a larger broadening in gE,
and consequently a negative heat capacity. The analysis
presented in this paper shows how the complex topology
of the PEL can be explored to extract the main features
that determine the sign of the heat capacity of metal
clusters.

FIG. 1: Heat capacity of NaN , N = 13 (a); 20 (b); 55 (c); 135
(d); 142 (e); and 147 (f) clusters. The cluster energy is cal-
culated taking as reference the value of the binding energy of
the most-stable (lowest-energy) conﬁguration given in Table
I of Ref. 23.

FIG. 3: Distribution function of the kinetic energy for NaN ,
N = 13 (a); 20 (b); 55 (c); 135 (d); 142 (e); and 147 (f)
clusters. The three curves displayed in each panel correspond
to the solid- (lower energy), melting- (intermediate energy),
and liquid-like (higher energy) phases.

FIG. 2: Energy dependence of the ZE (black dots) and Z(2)
E
(stars) values for NaN , N = 13 (a); 20 (b); 55 (c); 135 (d); 142
(e); and 147 (f) clusters. The ZE values were calculated using
Eq. (5) whereas the Z(2)
E values, which are an approximation
of ZE according to Eq. (9), were obtained using the second
moment of the distribution function of the kinetic energy. See
the related text for an explanation of the diﬀerence between
these quantities. The cluster energy is calculated taking as
reference the value of the binding energy of the most-stable
(lowest-energy) conﬁguration given in Table I of Ref. 23.

FIG. 4: Comparison of the maximum values of Z(2)
E (black
dots for the NaN clusters) and the threshold Zc (continuous
line) as a function of the cluster size. The star shows the
maximum value of Z(2)
E for the Cd55 cluster. The upper in-
sets show the energy dependence of the caloric curve and the
heat capacity of the Cd55 cluster. The inset at the low right
corner shows the gE as a function of the normalized mean
deviation of the kinetic energy of the Cd55 cluster, and its
comparison with Na55, calculated at E = 4.37 eV and E =
2.71 eV, respectively.

FIG. 5: Normalized distribution of potential energy min-
ima for the Na55 and Cd55 clusters. This distribution was
obtained from two thousand quenchings separated by 10000
time steps during a MD trajectory of 20 million time steps.
The values of E=4.37 eV (Cd55) and E=2.71 eV (Na55) cor-
respond to the cluster energies when they are at the middle
of the melting-like transition. The vertical dashed lines sepa-
rate intervals of low (L), medium (M), and high (H) potential
energy. The insets show the total (full line), including the L,
M, and H intervals, and partial (taking diﬀerent subsets of
isomers) gE,har, as a function of the normalized mean kinetic
energy.

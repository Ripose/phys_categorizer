Abstract. Models describing one- and two-photon transitions for ions in crystalline en-

vironments are uniﬁed and extended to the case of parity-allowed and parity-forbidden

p-photon transitions. The number of independent parameters for characterizing the polar-

ization dependence is shown to depend on an ensemble of properties and rules which combine

symmetry considerations and physical models.

0. Introduction and Preliminaries

Electronic spectroscopy of partly-ﬁlled shell ions, like dN and f N ions, embedded in con-

densed matter surroundings has been the object of important developments in the recent

years. In particular, the advent of tunable dye lasers has made possible to perform two-

photon spectroscopy experiments. This Letter is concerned with p-photon spectroscopy of

a transition ion with ground atomic conﬁguration nℓN in a given crystal ﬁeld with generic

symmetry G. We address here the question of obtaining a closed-form expression for the in-

tensity of a p-photon (absorption) transition between an initial Stark level i with symmetry

species Γ and a ﬁnal Stark level f with symmetry species Γ′. The labels Γ and Γ′ stand for

two IRC’s (irreducible representation classes) of the double group G∗ of G ≃ G∗/Z2. The

group G∗ may be considered (up to isomorphism) as a subgroup of SU (2).

According to Dirac and G¨oppert-Mayer, the transition moment Mi(Γγ)→f (Γ′γ′) for a

p-photon transition between the initial state i(Γγ) and the ﬁnal state f (Γ′γ′) is given by

Mi(Γγ)→f (Γ′γ′) =

X
vj

(f Γ′γ′|(D. E1)|v1) (v1|(D. E2)|v2) · · · (vp−1|(D. Ep)|iΓγ)
(Ωi − Ωv1 )(Ωi − Ωv2 ) · · · (Ωi − Ωvp−1)

+ perm (1)

in the framework of the electric dipolar approximation. The sum on vj in (1) has to be

performed on all the intermediate states and “perm” indicates that p! permuted terms arise

in the Feynman representation associated to Mi(Γγ)→f (Γ′γ′) when the p photons are diﬀerent.

The operator (D. Ek) in (1) is the scalar product of the dipole moment operator D for the N

electrons with the unit polarization vector Ek of the single-mode for the kth photon. (We use

single-modes to describe the electromagnetic ﬁeld.) Furthermore, the factors (Ωi − Ωvj ) are

energy denominators for the system radiation ﬁeld plus ion in its environment. Finally, the

labels γ and γ′ distinguish the components of the Stark levels i and f when the dimensions

[Γ] and [Γ′] of the IRC’s Γ and Γ′ are greater than 1, respectively.

1

At this stage, we must consider two types of p-photon transitions: the parity-allowed

and parity-forbidden transitions. The parity-allowed transitions occur either between levels

of the same parity (i ∈ nℓN and f ∈ nℓN ) when p is even or between levels of opposite

parities (i ∈ nℓN and f ∈ nℓN−1n′ℓ′ with (−1)ℓ+ℓ

= −1) when p is odd. The parity-

′

forbidden transitions (nℓN → nℓN for p odd and nℓN → nℓN−1n′ℓ′ with (−1)ℓ+ℓ

= −1 for

′

p even) may become possible, via the Van Vleck mechanism, if G does not have a center of

inversion (or if the inversion symmetry is broken by vibronic coupling or ligand polarization).

The sums over the intermediate states vj in (1) can be eﬀectuated by using a quasi-

closure approximation of the type of the ones used by many authors [1-5] for p = 1 or 2 in

the cases of dN and f N ions. Such an approximation used in conjunction with recoupling

techniques for SU (2) irreducible tensorial sets leads to

Mi(Γγ)→f (Γ′γ′) = (f Γ′γ′|Heﬀ |iΓγ),

(2)

where the model-dependent operator Heﬀ is an eﬀective operator described in Section 2.

Both for parity-allowed and parity-forbidden transitions, we take the initial and ﬁnal

state vectors in the symmetry adapted form (x ≡ i or f )

|xΓγ) =

|αSLJaΓγ) c(αSLJaΓ; x).

(3)

X
αSLJa

The initial state i(Γγ) belongs to the conﬁguration nℓN and the ﬁnal state f (Γ′γ′) belongs

either to the conﬁguration nℓN or to the conﬁguration nℓN−1n′ℓ′. In (3), the SU (2) ⊃ G∗

vectors of type |jaΓγ) are connected to the SU (2) ⊃ U (1) vectors of type |jm) by

|jaΓγ) :=

|jm) (jm|jaΓγ).

(4)

The branching label a in (4) has to be used when the IRC Γ of G∗ occurs several times in

the IRC (j) of SU (2). This external multiplicity label may be described, at least partially,

j

X
m=−j

2

by IRC’s of subgroups of SU (2) that contain in turn the group G∗. The expansions (3) and

(4) are of a completely diﬀerent nature. Equation (4) is of a group theoretical nature: the

reduction coeﬃcients (jm|jaΓγ) depend on the chain SU (2) ⊃ G∗ but not on the physics

of the problem. On the other hand, the expansions (3) depend on physical models: the c

coeﬃcients may be obtained from the diagonalization of one or two G-invariant Hamiltoni-

ans (according to whether as the initial and ﬁnal conﬁgurations are the same or diﬀerent)

describing the ion in its environment. It is to be noted that, thanks to Schur’s lemma, we

may always standardize the reduction coeﬃcients (jm|jaΓγ) in (4) in such a way that the

expansion coeﬃcients c in (3) be independent of the generalized magnetic quantum numbers

γ and γ′. This result is essential in view of the sum on γ and γ′ in (5) below. Equation (3)

indicates that we adopt here the philosophy of [6-9] where the diagonalization-optimization

of the G-invariant Hamiltonian(s) is done, without loss of generality, in a weak-ﬁeld basis

adapted to the chain SU (2) ⊃ G∗: the labels α, S, L and J are not taken a priori as good

quantum numbers; the only good quantum numbers are Γ, γ and Γ′, γ′ for the initial and

ﬁnal state vectors, respectively (and the parity for parity-allowed transitions).

The physical quantity we want to calculate in Section 2 is the intensity

X
γγ′ (cid:12)
(cid:12)
for the i(Γ) → f (Γ′) transition. The sum in (5) has to be done over all the external

Si(Γ)→f (Γ′) :=

2

Mi(Γγ)→f (Γ′γ′)(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(5)

multiplicity labels γ and γ′, i.e., over all the components of the initial and ﬁnal Stark levels.

(The labels γ and γ′ may be characterized, at least partially, by IRC’s of subgroups of G∗.)

The purpose of this work is to show how far group theory can go in the determination

of Si(Γ)→f (Γ′) in connection with sophisticated models for the operator Heﬀ of (2).

In

particular, we want to clearly separate the elements arising from group theory (via Wigner-

Racah calculus) from the model-dependent quantities (both for the light-matter interaction

3

and the description of the ℓN ion in its environment). Rather than considering G∗ as an

isolated group, we shall consider it as a subgroup of SU (2), an approach that has already

proved to be very useful as far as the energy spectrum of the ℓN ion in G symmetry is

concerned [8, 9]. The basic tool is thus the Wigner-Racah algebra of the group G∗ in a

G∗ ⊂ SU (2) basis. Therefore we develop, in Section 1, those nontrivial aspects of the

Wigner-Racah algebra for the chain SU (2) ⊃ G∗ that are essential for performing the sum

in (5). The corollary obtained in Section 1 is applied in Section 2 to derive the sum rule

(23) with the accompanying properties and rules (26-28).

1. Sum Rule for SU (2) ⊃ G∗ Coupling Coeﬃcients

Equation (4) deﬁnes the {jaΓγ} scheme for the chain SU (2) ⊃ G∗ that is more appropriate in

condensed matter spectroscopy than the {jm} scheme for the chain SU (2) ⊃ U (1) [6, 8, 9].

For j, a and Γ ﬁxed, the set {|jaΓγ) : γ = 1, · · · , [Γ]} is a (standardized) G-irreducible

tensorial set (in the sense of Fano and Racah) of vectors associated to Γ. Similarly, from

the SU (2) ⊃ U (1) spherical tensor operators U (k)
expansion similar to (4) so that, for k, a and Γ ﬁxed, the set nU (k)
G-irreducible tensorial set of operators associated to Γ. The latter G-irreducible tensorial

, we deﬁne the operators U (k)

aΓγ : γ = 1, · · · , [Γ]o is a

aΓγ by an

q

sets are also labelled by IRC’s of SU (2) and, therefore, we can easily generate, by direct

sum, nonstandard SU (2)-irreducible tensorial sets. Thus, we may apply the Wigner-Eckart

theorem for the group SU (2) in a nonstandard basis adapted to its subgroup G∗. As a

result, we have [8]

(τ1j1a1Γ1γ1|U (k)

aΓγ|τ2j2a2Γ2γ2) = (τ1j1kU (k)kτ2j2)

where Γ0 denotes the identity IRC of G∗. In the right hand side of (6), the quantum numbers

τ1 and τ2, external to the chain SU (2) ⊃ G∗, appear in the reduced matrix element.

The f or 3-jaΓγ symbol in (7) is an SU (2) ⊃ G∗ symmetry adapted form of the usual

3-jm Wigner symbol. It constitutes a symmetrized form of the coeﬃcient [8]

that generalizes the f coeﬃcient deﬁned by Racah and some of his students (in particular

Sch¨onfeld and Flato, see references [6, 7]).

The 2-jaΓγ symbol deﬁned by (8) turns out to be an SU (2) ⊃ G∗ symmetry adapted

form of the Herring-Wigner metric tensor. Indeed, from (7) and (8) we have

(10)

Therefore, the metric tensor given by (10) allows us to handle all the phases occurring in

the {jaΓγ} scheme [8].

By combining (7), (9) and (10), we can rewrite (6) in the simple form

(τ1j1a1Γ1γ1|U (k)

The interest of (6) and (11) for electronic spectroscopy of ions in crystalline ﬁelds has been

discussed in [8, 9]. From a mathematical viewpoint, it is to be observed that the factorization

in (11) into the product of a G∗-dependent factor (the f coeﬃcient) by a G∗-independent

factor is valid whatsoever the group G∗ is multiplicity free or not. The internal multiplicity

problem arising when G∗ is not multiplicity free is thus easily solved by making use of (11).

The f coeﬃcients may be considered as the components of a third-rank tensor (second-

rank covariant and ﬁrst-rank contravariant). In contradistinction, the f symbol deﬁnes a

third-rank contravariant tensor. The other properties of the f and f coeﬃcients that are of

relevance for this work are based on the following lemma.

LEMMA (Racah’s lemma). We have the factorization formula [10]

where (j2a2Γ2 + kaΓ|j1a1βΓ1) is an isoscalar factor or reduced f symbol (independent of the

quantum numbers γ1, γ2 and γ) and (Γ2Γγ2γ|Γ2ΓβΓ1γ1) a Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient for

the group G∗ considered as an isolated entity. (The label β is an internal multiplicity label

to be used when the Kronecker product Γ2 ⊗ Γ is not multiplicity free.)

Proof. Equation (12) is a consequence of Schur’s lemma.

In order to be able to use tables and/or computer programs for the highly symmetrical

f symbol (and for the Rβ or reduced f symbol, see (13) and (14)), it is useful to transcribe

duced by the Chinese school of Tang Au-chin [12]. (In (13) and (14), the label β is absolutely

necessary when the identity IRC Γ0 appears several times in Γ1 ⊗ Γ2 ⊗ Γ3.) The Rβ symbol

is connected to the isoscalar factor of (12) by

Repeated applications of Racah’s lemma and of the orthonormality-completeness prop-

erty for the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients of G∗ lead to the following corollary.

Z(j1a1, j2a2, k3a3,j4a4, j5a5, k6a6; Γ1Γ2Γ3) = (−1)2(k3+k6) [Γ1]−2 [j1] [j4]

2. Intensity Formula

For a given transition operator Heﬀ , we are now in a position to eﬀectuate the summation

over γ and γ′ in (5) and, thus, to obtain a compact expression for the intensity Si(Γ)→f (Γ′ ).

A very general expression for the eﬀective operator Heﬀ is

Heﬀ =

k1k2···kp−1

X
t

X

X

C[k1k2 · · · kp−1; t; kSkL; k] (cid:16){P(kp−1)X(t)}(k). W(kS kL)k

(cid:17) ,

(20)

8

where ( . ) is a scalar product involving electronic (W(kS kL)k) and nonelectronic (P(kp−1)

and X(t)) tensors. In Equation (20), P(kp−1) denotes the polarization tensor deﬁned by

P(kp−1) := {· · · {{E1E2}(k1)E3}(k2) · · · Ep}(kp−1)

(21)

that describes the coupling of the p polarization vectors and that is entirely under the

control of the experimentalist. The tensors W(kS kL)k and X(t) are relative to the ion and

its environment: W(kS kL)k is an electronic double tensor of spin degree kS, orbital degree

kL and total degree k whereas X(t) is a (single) tensor of the degree t, for instance, the

ligand polarization tensor or the crystal-ﬁeld tensor. (The tensor X(t) may result of the

coupling of several G-invariant operators according to the order of the mechanism used.)

The C coeﬃcients are model-dependent parameters that depend, among other things, on

the initial, ﬁnal and intermediate conﬁgurations as well as on the energies of the p photons.

Equation (20) uniﬁes various models introduced in [1-4] for p = 1 and in [5, 13-24] for p = 2.

It can be applied to both (i) parity-allowed and (ii) parity-forbidden transitions.

(i) The particular case of intra-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions (p = 2) is of

special interest. For parity-allowed transitions within the conﬁguration nℓN , it is suﬃcient

to take t = 0 with X(0) = 1 in order to describe second-order mechanisms when kS = 0

and second- plus third-order mechanisms when kS = 0 and kS 6= 0. The situation where

t 6= 0 permits to describe (other) third-order mechanisms when kS = 0 and fourth-order

mechanisms when kS 6= 0. As a matter of fact, (20) gives back the model introduced by

Axe [5] (with t = 0, kS = 0) for second-order mechanisms and extended by diﬀerent authors

[14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21] (with t 6= 0, kS 6= 0) to take into account higher-order mechanisms.

(ii) Two particular cases deserve a special attention, viz., the intra-conﬁgurational

one-photon transitions and the inter-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions. For parity-

9

forbidden transitions, X(t) is either the ligand polarization tensor or the odd crystal-ﬁeld

tensor. In the case of one-photon transitions (p = 1) within the conﬁguration nℓN , (20)

with kS = 0 gives as a special case the operator implicitly considered by several people

in order to explain intra-conﬁgurational one-photon transitions for dN [1, 2] or f N [3, 4]

ions in crystals. In the case of inter-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions (p = 2) between

the conﬁguration nℓN and the conﬁguration nℓN−1n′ℓ′ with ℓ + ℓ′ odd, (20) with kS = 0

yields as particular cases the operators introduced in connection with either a static cou-

pling mechanism [13, 16, 19, 22, 24] when X(t) is the odd crystal-ﬁeld tensor or a dynamic

coupling mechanism [19, 22] when X(t) is the ligand polarization tensor.

The transition matrix element for the operator (20) may be easily calculated owing to

(11). We thus get

in terms of f coeﬃcients in view of the connecting formula (arising from the comparison of

PROPERTY 1. In the general case, we have the (hermiticity) property

I[{ℓi} {ki} srΓ′′; ΓΓ′] = I[{ki} {ℓi} rsΓ′′; ΓΓ′]∗

(26)

formula

I[{ki} {ℓi} rsΓ′′; ΓΓ′] = χ[{ki} rΓ′′; ΓΓ′] χ[{ℓi} sΓ′′; ΓΓ′]∗,

(27a)

11

where the function χ is deﬁned through

χ[{ki} rΓ′′; ΓΓ′] :=

Yk(J ′a′Γ′, JaΓ, {ki} r¯rΓ′′) (J ′a′Γ′ + k¯rΓ′′|JaΓ)

which follows from (24) and the factorized form of Z (see (18)).

The number of independent parameters I in the expansion (23) can be a priori deter-

mined from the two following selection rules used together with Properties 1 and 2.

RULE 1. In order to have Si(Γ)→f (Γ′ ) 6= 0, it is necessary that

Γ′′ ⊂ Γ′∗ ⊗ Γ

Γ′′ ⊂ (kp−1)

Γ′′ ⊂ (ℓp−1)

Γ′′ ⊂ (k)

Γ′′ ⊂ (ℓ),

(28)

where (kp−1), (ℓp−1), (k) and (ℓ) are IRC’s of the group O(3) and Γ′∗ is the complex conju-

gate of Γ′.

RULE 2. The sum over {ki} and {ℓi} in the intensity formula (23) is partially controlled

by the following points. (i) The order of the mechanism used for describing the absorption

processus: kp−1 and ℓp−1 cannot vanish if only p-order mechanisms, corresponding to t =

kS = 0, are taken into consideration. (In this case, kp−1 = kL = k and ℓp−1 = ℓL = ℓ.)

Conversely, kp−1 and ℓp−1 may be zero if higher-order mechanisms, corresponding to t 6= 0

and/or kS 6= 0, are introduced. (ii) The nature of the photons: if the p absorbed photons

have the same polarization, then k1(and ℓ1) = 0, 2 so that if ki(or ℓi) = 0 we have ki+1(or

ℓi+1) = 1 and ki+2(or ℓi+2) = 0, 2 when i ≥ 1.

3. Discussion and Closing Remarks

For low values of kp−1 and ℓp−1, there is no summation on r and s, two branching multiplicity

labels of type a, in the intensity formula (23). (The frequency of Γ′′ in (kp−1) and (ℓp−1)

12

is rarely greater than 1 for p ≤ 2.) The group-theoretical selection rules (28) impose strong

limitations on the summation over Γ′′ in (23) once Γ and Γ′ are ﬁxed and the range of values

of k and ℓ is chosen.

The number of independent intensity parameters I in (23) is determined by: (i) the

number of photons and their nature (polarization, energy), cf. Rules 1 and 2; (ii) the symme-

try group G, cf. Rule 1; (iii) the symmetry property (26), cf. Property 1; (iv) the use of t = 0

and kS = 0 (p-order mechanism) or t 6= 0 and kS 6= 0 (higher-order mechanisms), cf. Rule 2;

(v) the kind of the (weak-, intermediate- or strong-ﬁeld) coupling used for the state vectors,

cf. (3). Points (i)-(ii) depend on external physical conditions. On the other hand, points

(iv) and (v) are model-dependent. In particular, in the case where the J-mixing, cf. point

(v), can be neglected, a situation of interest for lanthanide ions, the summations on k and ℓ

in (24) are reduced by the rule |J − J ′| ≤ k, ℓ ≤ J + J ′, where J and J ′ are the total angular

momenta for the initial and ﬁnal states, respectively. Similar restrictions apply to kS and

kL in (25) if the S- and L-mixing are neglected.

The computation, via Equations (18) or (19), (24) and (25), of the I parameters is

a diﬃcult task in general. Therefore, they may be considered, at least in a ﬁrst step,

as phenomenological parameters.

In this respect, Equations (18) or (19), (24) and (25)

should serve as a guide for reducing the number of I parameters. Once the number of

independent parameters I in the intensity formula (23) has been determined, we can obtain

the polarization dependence of the intensity strength Si(Γ)→f (Γ′) by calculating the tensor

products P (K)

a′′Γ′′γ′′ (with K = kp−1, ℓp−1 and a′′ = r, s) occurring in Equation (23).

To close this Letter, some remarks are in order. In the particular case p = 1 and 2, the

Hamiltonian model given by (20) and (21) uniﬁes various models described in the literature

13

for rare earth ions and transition-metal ions. The originality of this work rests on the use of

symmetry adaptation methods for the chain SU (2) ⊃ G∗ in conjunction with a very general

Hamiltonian model for describing simultaneous absorption of p photons between Stark levels

(rather than between J levels). Nontrivial aspects of symmetry adaptation methods have

been taken into account in a quantitative way: factorization `a la Wigner-Eckart for the chain

SU (2) ⊃ G∗, Racah’s lemma for the corresponding coupling coeﬃcients and orthogonality-

completeness of the latter. As a net result, we have obtained the intensity formula (23)

where the dynamics appears in the I parameters and the geometry is contained in the P

factors describing the polarization dependence. The intensity formula (23) for multi-photon

absorption can be extended to multi-photon emission as well as to Rayleigh and Raman

scattering modulo some caution with the C parameters in (25). The general form of (23) is

also valid for other multi-photon processes, as for example the simultaneous absorption of

several photons, certain by electric-dipole absorption and others by magnetic-dipole and/or

electric-quadrupole absorption.

A word should be said about previous works on this subject. The subject treated in

the present Letter has been touched upon in [13, 21, 23-26] for p = 2 and fully developed

in the thesis by one of the authors (M.D.) for p arbitrary. The accent has been put here

on the intensity, rather than on the transition moment as in some works dealing with two-

photon spectroscopy [13, 21]. Furthermore, this work is concerned with models and their use

in connection with symmetry adaptation methods, rather than with qualitative symmetry

considerations only. In this respect, our work represents a further important step besides

the pioneer works by Inoue and Toyozawa [25], on one hand, and by Bader and Gold [26], on

the other hand, where only symmetry considerations, arising from the group G considered

as an isolated entity, are introduced in the situation where p = 2.

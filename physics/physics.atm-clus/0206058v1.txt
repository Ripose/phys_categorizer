Abstract

Diﬀerential Faddeev equations in total angular momentum representation are used
for the ﬁrst time to investigate ultra-low energy elastic scattering of a helium atom
on a helium dimer. Six potential models of interatomic interaction are investigated.
The results improve and extend the Faddeev equations based results known in
literature. The employed method can be applied to investigation of diﬀerent elastic
and inelastic processes in three- and four-atomic weakly bounded systems below
three-body threshold.

1 Introduction

The systems of helium atom small clusters were a subject of a number of ex-
perimental and theoretical researches during the last decades [1–19]. Develop-
ment of new experimental techniques [1–3] has stimulated growing interest to
theoretical investigation of bound states and scattering dynamics in such sys-
tems. Availability of numerous potential models [4–10] of He-He interatomic
interaction provides a good background for such theoretical researches [11–19].

Although the number of papers devoted to investigation of small helium cluster
bound states, especially helium trimer, is considerable, the number of known
results with respect to scattering in such systems is still very limited. There

are only a few estimations for He-He2 scattering length [21,22] and, up to our
knowledge, only one group has published results both for He-He2 scattering
length and phase shifts [14,15]. However, the accuracy of the known results
for scattering length and phase shifts seems to be insuﬃcient to resolve the
details of diﬀerent potential models.

The calculations presented here are performed on the base of diﬀerential Fad-
deev equations in conﬁguration space in total angular momentum representa-
tion [24]. This formalism was already used in our calculations of 4He3 bound
states [19,20] and allowed us to obtain very accurate and detailed description
for both ground and excited states of the trimer. Applying this rigorous and
reliable formalism to scattering we expect to obtain benchmark-quality results
for He-He2 scattering length and phase shifts. The ﬁrst presentation of these
results is the subject of this Letter.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give a brief description of
the equations we solve and a short sketch on the new solution technique. The
results of our calculations are provided with comments and a short discussion
in Section 3. In Section 4 we give a short resume and present our view on the
possible future application of the methods employed in this paper.

2 Formalism

According to the Faddeev formalism [23] the wave function of three particles
is expressed in terms of Faddeev components Φ

Ψ(x1, y1) = Φ1(x1, y1) + Φ2(x2, y2) + Φ3(x3, y3) ,

(1)

where xα and yα are Jacobi coordinates corresponding to the ﬁxed pair α

xα = (

2mβmγ
mβ + mγ

)

2 (rβ −

rγ) ,

yα = (

2mα(mβ + mγ)
mα + mβ + mγ

1

)

2 (rα −

mβrβ + mγrγ
mβ + mγ

) .

(2)

Here rα are the positions of the particles in the center-of-mass frame. The
Faddeev components obey the set of three equations

α = 1, 2, 3

where Vα(xα) stands for pairwise potential. To make this system of equations
suitable for numerical calculations one should take into account the symme-
tries of the physical system. Exploiting the identity of Helium atoms one can
reduce the system of equations (3) to one equation [23]. Since all the model
potentials are central it is also possible to factor out the degrees of freedom
corresponding to the rotations of the whole cluster [24]. For the case of zero
total angular momentum the reduced Faddeev equation reads

(H0 + V (1 + P )

E)Φ(x, y, z) = 0 ,

where H0 is the restriction of free Hamiltonian to the intrinsic space corre-
sponding to zero total angular momentum

Here x±, y± and z± are Jacobi coordinates corresponding to other partition-

In this paper we concentrate our attention on the case of elastic scattering
only. In this case the solution of the Faddeev equation (4) can be presented
as a sum of two terms

Φ(x, y, z) = χ(x, y, z) + ˜Φ(x, y, z) .

(6)

The function χ(x, y, z) corresponds to the initial state of the system, i.e. free
motion of the atom and the dimer, the second term ˜Φ(x, y, z) corresponds to
the scattered state of the atom and the dimer. Explicit expression for χ(x, y, z)
reads

χ(x, y, z) = ϕ2(x)

sin ky
k

,

where ϕ2(x) is the two-body bound state wave function, k = √E
E2, E2 is
the energy of the two-body bound state and E is the total energy of the three-
body system in the center of mass frame. The asymptotic boundary condition
for the function ˜Φ(x, y, z) is deﬁned as

−

˜Φ(x, y, z)

a(k)
k

−→y
→∞

ϕ2(x) cos ky ,

where a(k) stands for the elastic scattering amplitude. Substituting the repre-
sentation (6) to the equation (4) we get the equation for the function ˜Φ(x, y, z)

(H0 + V (1 + P )

E) ˜Φ(x, y, z) =

V P χ(x, y, z) .

−

−

To calculate the low-energy scattering characteristics of the system one has
to solve the equation (8) with the asymptotic boundary condition (7). The
scheme of numerical solution of the equation is not the subject of the Letter,
but we would like to mention some features of the method we employ that

seem to be original or at least that were not applied for few-body calculations
previously.

The general scheme of the problem discretization reproduces the one used in
our helium trimer calculations [19,20]. However, the way we use tensor-trick
preconditioning [26] is changed, that allowed us to reduce the dimension of the
corresponding linear problem almost twice. Due to the structure of the Fad-
deev equations, in the case of potentials decreasing suﬃciently fast, the region
in conﬁguration space where an interaction between atoms vanishes has a sim-
ple geometric shape of a hypercylinder x > xmax exterior. Therefore, outside
of the hypercyllinder the Faddeev component ˜Φ(x, y, z) satisfy an equation for
free particles. At the same time, for large values of y, where the component
meets the asymptotic boundary conditions, it satisﬁes the equation

(H0 + V (x)

E) ˜Φ(x, y, z)

0 , y > ymax .

−

≈

Taking into account the aforementioned observations one can ﬁnd that a new
component deﬁned as

(9)

τ (x, y, z)

(H0 + V (x)

E) ˜Φ(x, y, z)

is localized much better in coordinate x than the original component ˜Φ(x, y, z)
and can be approximated using much less grid points. One can even prove that
unlike the original component ˜Φ(x, y, z) such component is square integrable
for scattering states (square integrability of a similar object was brieﬂy dis-
cussed in [27]). The equation for τ (x, y, z) reads

τ (x, y, z) =

V P χ(x, y, z)

This is the equation which we solve numerically using Krylov subspace pro-
1 entering the equation is
jection techniques. The operator (H0 + V
a resolvent of so called cluster Hamiltonian which corresponds to a system of
one free and two interacting particles. In our approach this operator is con-
structed by solving the corresponding diﬀerential equation with appropriate
asymptotic boundary conditions, what is made using tensor-trick technique.
Having the equation (11) solved, we recover the original component ˜Φ(x, y, z)
according to the deﬁnition (10), using the same tensor-trick.

As a result of numerical procedure we get an approximate solution ˜Φ(x, y, z).
To recover the scattering amplitude we compare the numerical solution with

Stability of this function with respect to variations of x, y and z coordinates
indicates, that the asymptotic region is reached in the calculations and the
function approaches the scattering amplitude. Such simple test for an asymp-
totic region is made possible by use of Cartesian coordinates [17]. Another
advantage provided by the usage of Cartesian coordinates is a simple test for
the quality of a grid taken in x coordinate: this grid should support the correct
value of the dimer binding energy [17,19].

3 Results

In this section we describe our calculations of He-He2 elastic scattering and
give a brief comparison of our calculations with other published results.

On the preliminary stage of the calculations we have veriﬁed, that our code
reproduces the known properties of helium trimer ground and excited states
for a particular potential model. To do it, a special version of the code using
exactly the same procedures as the ones involved in scattering calculations
was developed. All the known ﬁgures of trimer ground and excited state en-
ergies [19] were successfully reproduced. After that we have performed a set
of calculations with maximal values of x and y taken at 2500 ˚A. The analysis
of the results has allowed us to conclude that for small values of atom-dimer
kinetic energy the asymptotic region starts approximately from 1000 ˚A in y
coordinate. For all the values of y taken in the region y > 1000 ˚A and for all
x > 2 ˚A (outside of the repulsive core region) the value of scattering ampli-
tude was stable up to 5 ﬁgures. The most of the subsequent calculations were
performed with maximal values of x and y ﬁxed at 1200 ˚A. To ensure that
our results are stable and accurate we have performed the calculations of the
He-He2 scattering length, phase shifts and scattering amplitude using diﬀerent
sets of grids. The stability of the scattering length and scattering amplitude
with respect to the number of grid points is demonstrated in the Tables 1 and
2. The presented data allows to estimate the accuracy of our scattering length
calculations as low as 0.1% what is comparable with the accuracy of the used
physical constants.

In the Table 3 we present the results of scattering length and phase shifts cal-
culations for six diﬀerent potential models. The potentials HFD-B, LM2M2
and TTY were already used in atom-dimer scattering calculations [14,15,22].
The estimations of scattering observables for more recent SAPT, SAPT1 and
SAPT2 potentials are presented here for the ﬁrst time. The potentials SAPT1
and SAPT2 [10] are constructed taking into account retardation eﬀects that
7) at large inter-
lead to the change of the highest term from O(x−
6) long-distance asymp-
atomic distances [28]. All other potentials have O(x−
totic behavior.

6) to O(x−

To prove the correctness of our calculations we must compare our results with
known published results and to explain the diﬀerences between our results
and results of other authors if possible. Unfortunately, only small number of
independent results were published with respect to He-He2 scattering problem.
The number of calculations that take into account the interatomic interactions
in the states with non-spherical symmetry is limited, up to our knowledge, only
by the results of Motovilov et al. [14,15] and recent calculations of Blume et
al. [22]. Our results for scattering length are brought together with the results
known from literature in the Table 4. Obviously, the diﬀerence between our
results and other results is far from negligible and requires an explanation.

The results of Motovilov et al. [14,15] were obtained by solving Faddeev dif-
ferential equations in bispherical harmonics representation, and only the ﬁrst
three terms of the bispherical expansion were taken into account. It can be
shown, that this approach corresponds to the simplest grid in z coordinate
that can be used within our method. This grid consists of the only one inter-
val and the corresponding spline basis contains 6 basic polynomial functions.
However, as one can see from the Table 1, restriction of our basis to the sim-
plest case can not cover the observed diﬀerence of 10% in scattering length.
The source of the observed discrepancy can be found in the cutoﬀ distances
used in the numerical calculations. The values reported in [15] were obtained
for the cutoﬀ radius of 460 ˚A. According to [25] the choice of this cutoﬀ radius
was forced by the limitations of the available computer facilities. To check the
version about strong inﬂuence of the cutoﬀ radius to the result we have per-
formed calculations with cutoﬀ parameters xmax = 800 ˚A and ymax = 460 ˚A.
The results of these calculations are also presented in the Table 4. Evidently,
they are in perfect agreement with the results of [15]. Therefore we can con-
ﬁdently conﬁrm the consistency of our results and the results published by
Motovilov et al. [15]. However, we must note, that for such reduced cutoﬀ
parameters the scattering amplitude varies within 30% interval even outside
of the core region what indicates that such small cutoﬀ distance is not enough

7

to obtain stable results. As one can see from the Fig. 1, the asymptotic region
where the scattering amplitude is rather stable with respect to variations of
coordinates starts approximately from y

1000 ˚A.

≈

Even though the results for scattering length published in [15] considerably
diﬀers from the results presented in this Letter, the discrepancy between the
results for phase shifts, as one can see from the Fig. 2, is not so big. The
diﬀerence slightly grows towards 2-body threshold, however in the vicinity of
3-body threshold (E = 0) the diﬀerence is rather small.

Unfortunately, the estimations of numerical error for the calculations per-
formed by Blume et al. [22] are not available. Being aimed to calculation of
larger clusters, their technique diﬀers much from the one employed in this
work. It makes detailed comparison of our results diﬃcult, and we can only
mention that their result for He-He2 scattering length is in better agreement
with the our one than the result of [15].

4 Conclusions

New results for He-He2 scattering length and elastic scattering phase shifts
are presented for six diﬀerent potential models. Being based on a rigorous
theoretical approach suitable for atom-dimer scattering calculations (Faddeev
equations in total angular momentum representation, Cartesian coordinates)
and an original numerical technique, these results improve the reference results
of Motovilov et al.[15] by two orders of magnitude. The results for SAPT,
SAPT1 and SAPT2 potential models are new.

Comparison of elastic scattering parameters calculated for the available po-
tential models shows, that diﬀerence between the parameters is rather small
and can hardly reveal the ﬁne details of the He-He interatomic interaction. It
gives promise that low-energy properties of He-He interaction can be repro-
duced within much simpler model than realistic potential models employed in
this work.

The numerical technique developed and applied in this work can be further
applied in investigation of bound states and scattering of other exotic sys-
tems. For instance, it can be applied to calculate bound states and scatter-
ing in the systems of other rare gas atoms. Four-body calculations based on
Faddeev-Yakubovsky diﬀerential equations [29] can also be performed within
our approach.

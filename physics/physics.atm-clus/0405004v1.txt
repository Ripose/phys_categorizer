Infrared quadrupole modes (IRQM) of the valence electrons in light deformed sodium clusters are
studied by means of the time-dependent local-density approximation (TDLDA). IRQM are classiﬁed

speciﬁc electron-hole excitations, thus giving access to the single-electron spectrum near the Fermi
surface (HOMO-LUMO region). Most of IRQM are determined by cluster deformation and so can
serve as a sensitive probe of the deformation eﬀects in the mean ﬁeld. The IRQM branch λµ =21
is coupled with the magnetic scissors mode, which gives a chance to detect the latter. We discuss
two-photon processes, Raman scattering (RS), stimulated emission pumping (SEP), and stimulated
adiabatic Raman passage (STIRAP), as the relevant tools to observe IRQM. A new method to
detect the IRQM population in clusters is proposed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The most prominent electron mode in metal clusters
is the Mie surface plasmon [1]. Being the doorway to
many structural and dynamical properties, it has been
much investigated in the past, for extensive summaries
see e.g. [2, 3, 4, 5]. Besides the dominant Mie plasmon,
many other electron modes, both electric and magnetic,
have been predicted but not yet observed in clusters, for a
brief overview see [6]. Similar modes exist in other many-
fermion systems. In particular, almost all of them were
identiﬁed experimentally in atomic nuclei, for a review
see [7].

The analogy with deformed nuclei suggests that de-
formed clusters should exhibit a family of low-energy
(infrared) electron modes which are absent in spherical
systems. Deformed clusters have a partly ﬁlled valence
electron shell and so sustain low-energy one-electron-one-
hole (1eh) excitations inside this shell. Being mainly
determined by the deformation splitting, the excitation
energies are rather small and typically lie in the in-
frared. Since major shells in light clusters cover electron
levels with the same space parity, the infrared modes
should have positive parity. Their softness and deforma-
tion dependence suggest that these should be infrared
quadrupole modes (IRQM). In axially deformed clusters,
IRQM are represented by separate λµ =20, 21 and 22
branches (where λ = 2 stands for total angular momen-
tum and µ its azimuthal component).

Our present knowledge on infrared electronic excita-
tions in clusters is very poor. Even basic IRQM prop-
erties (spectrum, collectivity, evolution with cluster size
and deformation, responses to external ﬁelds) are un-
known. It is the aim of this paper to investigate main
features of IRQM from a theoretical perspective, hope-
fully delivering useful hints for an experimental search.

IRQM in light and in heavy clusters have a diﬀer-

light clusters or, speciﬁcally, free deformed singly-charged
light clusters. Such clusters have essential advantages
with respect to IRQM. First, they have an extremely
low spectral density at low excitation energies, a fea-
ture which facilitates a discrimination of IRQM in two-
photon processes. The low spectral density also re-
duces the unwanted level broadening (Landau fragmenta-
tion, electron-electron collisions). Beams of size-selected
singly-charged light clusters are readily available. So,
these clusters are well suited for measurements. Second,
as is shown below, IRQM in light clusters are dominated
by one 1eh component and can be directly and unam-
biguously interpreted in terms of the electron spectrum
in the HOMO-LUMO region. So, IRQM can deliver an
important information on the underlying mean ﬁeld level
structure. Since most of IRQM are induced by cluster de-
formation, they allow to study the evolution of the elec-
tronic levels with deformation. And third, there is a close
connection between λµ =21 branch of the IRQM and the
electronic scissors mode (SM) [9, 10, 11, 12]. This gives
a chance to observe the SM, at least indirectly, through
IRQM. SM is a universal dipole magnetic orbital mode
peculiar to deformed systems. It was already observed in
a variety of quantum systems but not yet in clusters.

Our calculations were performed within a linearized
time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA).
The ionic background is approximated by a soft deformed
jellium density, for reviews see [13, 14]. The method
goes back to early studies on cluster spectra [15]. It has
been successfully applied to study the dipole plasmon in
spherical [16] and deformed [17, 18] clusters. We will con-
sider here Na clusters as the simplest test case. However,
IRQM properties worked out below are of a general char-
acter and so should appear for all other metal clusters
with pronounced shell structure for valence electrons.

IRQM are not accessible by one-photon transitions
which excite exclusively dipole modes. Thus one has to
use two-photon processes (TPP) where the target state is

populated via an intermediate state by two (absorption
and emission) dipole transitions. The dipole plasmon can
serve as an intermediate state.

Experimental data on IRQM are very scarce and lim-
ited to heavy clusters (e.g. RS measurements of IRQM in
embedded silver clusters were reported [19]). Moreover,
typical two-photon techniques of atomic and molecular
spectroscopy are rarely used for clusters. This can be
partly explained by the fact that clusters have some spe-
ciﬁc properties (see discussion in Sec.V), which makes a
straightforward application of these techniques question-
able. In particular, the common methods of detection of
the level population, based on the radiative decay, seem
not to be appropriate for clusters.
In this paper, we
will examine applicability to clusters of some widespread
TPP: Raman scattering (RS), stimulated emission pump-
ing (SEP), or stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STI-
RAP). An alternative method for detection of the level
population in clusters will be proposed.

Altogether, the present study has two goals: i) to pro-
vide a ﬁrst guide on quadrupole electronic excitations in
light deformed clusters; ii) to explore the access to non-
dipole electron modes in clusters by modern two-photon
techniques.

The paper is outlined as follows. Section II describes
the theoretical framework and choice of the most suitable
clusters. In section III, a general hierarchy of quadrupole
electron excitations in clusters is presented and the origin
of IRQM is clariﬁed. In section IV, the IRQM responses
in one- and two-photon processes are compared and the
1eh nature of IRQM is demonstrated. In section V, the
possibility to observe IRQM in two-photon process (RS,
SEP and STIRAP) is discussed. Conclusions are drawn
in section VI. In Appendix A, the dipole matrix elements
responsible for the coupling between the states involved
into two-photon process are analyzed. In Appendix B,
the scissor mode and its connection with the λµ = 21
branch of the IRQM are brieﬂy discussed.

II. CALCULATION SCHEME AND CLUSTER
CHOICE

A. Basic spectral properties

The electron cloud is described by the density-
functional theory at the level of the local-density approx-
imation (LDA) for the ground state and time-dependent
LDA (TDLDA) for the excitations, using actually the
functional of [20]. The ionic background of the cluster
is approximated by the soft jellium model allowing for
quadrupole and hexadecapole deformation [21].
IRQM
stay in the regime of small amplitudes. We thus em-
ploy linearized TDLDA, often called the random-phase-
approximation (RPA). The actual implementation in ax-
ial symmetry is explained in [17]. The reliability of the
method has been checked in diverse studies of the Mie
plasmon in spherical [16] and deformed [17, 18] clusters.

2

The choice of the clusters was dictated by the following
reasons: i) The clusters should be small enough to pos-
sess a dilute and non-collective IRQM spectrum. Only
then the spectrum can be resolved and unambiguously
related to the single-particle levels.
ii) Since IRQM are
mainly induced by cluster deformation, the clusters with
a strong deformation (both prolate and oblate) are desir-
able. The simplest case of axial shape is most suitable for
the analysis.
iii) Shape isomers exhibit diﬀerent single-
electron spectra [17, 18], which can result in smearing
out the low-energy spectral lines. The heavier are clus-
ters, the more isomers they have [17, 18]. So, the light
clusters with a strictly dominant equilibrium shape are
preferable. Between them, we should choose the clusters
whose ground state and isomers have the similar (pro-
late or oblate) shape. Thus we will minimize the blur-
ring IRQM spectra. iv) The jellium approximation is not
correct for very small clusters. This establishes a lower
limit for the cluster size.

The cluster choice can be preliminary done by review-
ing the properties of the dipole plasmon which will serve
as intermediate state in a two-photon process. Besides,
description of the dipole plasmon allows to estimate ac-
curacy of the model. Fig. 1 shows RPA results for the
dipole plasmon in light axially deformed Na clusters: pro-
late Na+
27 and oblate Na+
19. The shape
of each cluster is characterized by equilibrium quadrupole
and hexadecapole deformations, δ2 and δ4, obtained by
minimization of the total cluster energy [17, 18, 21]. To
simulate temperature and other sources of line broaden-
ing, the photoabsorption cross section is smoothed by a
Lorentzian [17].

As is seen from Fig. 1, the emerging dipole spectra con-
sist basically of two peaks, the weaker one (λµ =10) cor-
responds to oscillations along the symmetry axis and the
stronger one to the orthogonal mode λµ =11 (in fact, two
identical modes µ = ±1). In most of the clusters, these
peaks are well separated by the deformation splitting.
The most heavy sample Na+
27 shows some Landau frag-
mentation of the resonance peaks (distribution of the col-
lective strength between several RPA levels indicated by
vertical bars). This is the beginning of a trend which per-
sists towards heavier clusters. The Landau fragmentation
overrules the deformation splitting already at N ≈ 50
[18]. Thus one should stay in the region N ≤ 20 where
the spectra are still dilute and the Landau fragmenta-
tion is weak. Within that region, one should pick sam-
ples with a large deformation. The clusters Na+
7 , Na+
11
and Na+
15 seem to be the best candidates. Besides, their
isomeric and ground states have the similar shapes [22],
oblate in Na+
15. The anal-
ysis of IRQM in the next section conﬁrms this cluster
choice.

Fig. 1 shows that in general the folded spectra (solid
lines) agree nicely with the experiment (triangles) which
signiﬁes the reliability of the method. However, the jel-
lium plus RPA description, working well for the heavier
clusters, worsens for lighter ones. In Na+
11, the

7 and Na+

calculated spectra are redshifted and do not reproduce
the structure details. The discrepancy is due to the fact
that light clusters tend to be more compressed due to
larger surface tension [24]. But we use here a constant
Wigner-Seitz radius for reasons of simplicity. Besides,
the jellium approximation is certainly too rough for the
description of details in so light clusters. The results for
the smallest samples may not reach a quantitative level,
but they are still useful for qualitative consideration as
will be done here. Fig. 1 shows that even in the lightest
clusters the jellium TDLDA suﬃciently well reproduces
the average energy, principle gross-structure, and magni-
tude of the deformation splitting of the resonance. Such
accuracy suﬃces for our present survey.

B. Two photon process

We consider a two-photon process running via λµ = 10
or 11 branches of the dipole plasmon as the intermedi-
ate states, see Fig. 2. The branches are assumed to be
well separated by deformation splitting, which is indeed
the case for strongly deformed light clusters (see Fig. 1).
Then the two reaction paths can be disentangled by tun-
ing the photon frequency. This allows to specify and
monitor the process. For example, if the reaction runs
only via λµ =10 plasmon branch, then the population
of the low-energy λµ =22 mode is forbidden and only
20 and 21 modes remain to be considered. If one of the
paths is suppressed, (see discussion for Na+
7 in the next
section), then the reaction can be tuned to another path.
The comparison of the path rates delivers important in-
formation about the structure of the dipole plasmon and
IRQM.

The population of the IRQM is approximately calcu-
lated as a coherent sum of independent two-step pro-
cesses, each one being a product of dipole photoabsorp-
tion and photoemission:

· (ω1µ1i1 −ω2µ2i2 )3|h2µ2i2|er|1µ1i1i|2 .

Here |1µ1i1 > and |2µ2i2 > are RPA states of the dipole
and quadrupole spectra, respectively. The index i1 runs
over all RPA states with dipole content in the accessible
energy interval. The photoabsorption (photoemission)
dipole matrix elements in (1) deﬁne the coupling between
the ground and dipole (dipole and quadrupole) states in
two-photon processes. This coupling determines the Rabi
frequency, the decisive value in TPP.

Eq.

(1) follows from the general expression for RS
rate given elsewhere (see, e.g.
[25]) if one keeps only
the Stokes term and neglects the interference between
the neighboring intermediate states. The Stokes term

3

alone suﬃces to illustrate the population of IRQM in two-
photon processes. Moreover, already the dipole matrix
elements in (1) provide a solid ground for the analysis.
As for the interference, it should be weak in light clus-
ters.
Indeed, in Fig. 1 the dipole plasmon in clusters
with N ≤ 20 is represented by a few states separated
by large energy intervals. In any case, the interference
mainly leads to smoothing of the response, which can be
taken into account by a reasonable averaging the results.
In the present paper, we simulate the interference, tem-
perature and other smearing factors by folding the results
by a Lorentzian proﬁle with an averaging width ∆. The
spectral width is known to increase with the excitation
energy. So, we use ∆ =0.25 eV for the high-energy dipole
and quadrupole plasmons (like in our previous RPA cal-
culations for the photoabsorption spectra [16, 17, 18])
and ∆ =0.1 eV for the low-energy IRQM.

It worth noting that the photoabsorption and photoe-
mission dipole matrix elements in (1) have essentially dif-
ferent structure (see Appendix A for more detail). The
former is determined by the 1eh part of the dipole op-
erator er and is generally large. The latter is given by
1ee (electron-electron) and 1hh (hole-hole) parts of the
dipole operator and its value can broadly vary, depending
on the structure of the dipole and quadrupole states.

III.

IRQM IN THE HIERARCHY OF

QUADRUPOLE EXCITATIONS

The spectrum of the three-dimensional harmonic os-
cillator provides a useful sorting scheme for the valence
electron levels in metal clusters [3, 4, 26]. The levels are
sorted in perfectly degenerate bunches, the major quan-
tum shells characterized by the principle quantum num-
ber N = 0, 1, 2, .... The shells are separated by appre-
ciable energy gaps and every shell involves only states of
the same space parity π = (−1)N . This oscillator pic-
ture is well fulﬁlled in light clusters and provides still a
good approximation in medium and heavy ones. In ax-
ially deformed clusters, the levels are characterized by
Nilsson–Clemenger quantum numbers [26] ν = [N nzΛ]
where N is the major shell as before, nz is the number
of nodes along the symmetry axis z, and Λ is the projec-
tion of the orbital moment onto the same axis. Following
this scheme, excitations of valence electrons are charac-
terized by the ∆N value, the diﬀerence in shell for the
dominant 1eh jumps. Quadrupole excitations have even
parity and are collected into the branches ∆N = 0 and
2. The excitations with larger ∆N are weak and can be
neglected.

Figure 3 illustrates the hierarchy of quadrupole exci-
tations. The lower panels show the unperturbed pho-
toabsorption calculated for the pure 1eh states ignor-
ing the residual interaction. The upper panels give the
RPA photoabsorption. Let us ﬁrst look at the strong
quadrupole resonance appearing at high frequencies in
the range 2-4 eV. It is blue-shifted by the residual inter-

action and the larger the cluster, the stronger the shift
[29]. In heavy clusters this resonance is associated with
the quadrupole plasmon. The resonance is mainly formed
by E2 transitions over two major shells (∆N = 2). It
exists in clusters of any shape and exhausts most of
the quadrupole strength. The resonance is energetically
very close to the dipole Mie plasmon (in a simple esti-
mate ωλ = ωpl
λ/(2λ+1) where ωpl is the frequency of
the volume plasmon [4]). In spite of the energy overlap
with the dominant E1 plasmon, the E2 plasmon may, in
principle, be discriminated by means of angular-resolved
electron energy-loss spectroscopy (AR-EELS) at electron
scattering angles ∼ 6◦ [30].

p

In the present study, we are interested not in the high-
energy E2 resonance but in the IRQM which, being di-
lute and non-collective, can deliver important informa-
tion about the electron single-particle spectrum near the
Fermi (=HOMO) level. IRQM are associated with the
low-energy ∆N = 0 branch created by E2 transitions in-
side the valence shell. Being of the ∆N = 0 origin, IRQM
can exist only in clusters with partly occupied valence
shell, i.e.
in deformed clusters. In Fig. 3, IRQM reside
at 0.5-1.5 eV. As compared with the E2 resonance, the
IRQM spectrum is very dilute. It is represented only by
a few well separated levels. This prevents mixing of 1eh
conﬁgurations by the residual interaction and creation of
collective states. The IRQM persist to keep their 1eh
nature and so can be easily identiﬁed as particular 1eh
conﬁgurations. As is seen from Fig. 3, the IRQM have
very weak quadrupole strength in the photoabsorption.
But they may be accessible in two-photon reactions.

Fig. 4 shows single-particle levels and 1eh quadrupole
transitions inside the valence shells in Na+
11, and
Na+
15. Following this scheme, the IRQM excitations in
Fig. 3 can be unambiguously identiﬁed as particular 1eh
states. They include {[101] − [110]}21 in Na+
7 , {[220] −
[200]}20, {[220] − [211]}21, {[220] − [202]}22 in Na+
11, and
{[220] − [200]}20, {[211] − [202]}21, {[211] − [200]}21,
{[220] − [202]}22 in Na+
15.

7 , Na+

Electric and magnetic modes with the same Λπ are
known to mix in deformed systems (see, e.g., [31]). The
mixture of electric E21 and magnetic orbital M11 excita-
tions is especially interesting since it provides access to
the orbital M1 scissors mode (SM) [9, 10, 11, 12]. The
properties of this mode are sketched in Appendix B.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A variety of IRQM spectral distributions is shown in
Fig. 5. The ﬁrst line of the ﬁgure contains the quadrupole
photoabsorption for IRQM states with λµ =20, 21 and
22. Though IRQM cannot be observed in photoabsorp-
tion, the latter is useful in any analysis of electron modes
and so is worth to be considered. The second line ex-
hibits magnetic dipole strengths for the magnetic dipole
scissors mode (SM). The next two lines show the two-
photon populations (1) when the TPP runs separately

4

through λµ =10 and 11 branches of the dipole plasmon.
The intermediate states in the two-photon process in-
volve all the RPA dipole states from the plasmon region.
The quadrupole spectra in Fig. 5 can be easily identi-
ﬁed by 1eh transitions exhibited in Fig. 4. Most of the
transitions connect the levels arising due to deformation
splitting. The corresponding IRQM are determined by
the deformation and vanish at the spherical shape.

The ﬁrst panel of Fig. 5 shows that IRQM are selec-
tively active in the quadrupole photoabsorption. Some
11 and λµ =20 and 22 in Na+
modes (λµ =22 in Na+
15)
have small E2-transition matrix elements and so are sup-
pressed in this one-photon process. However, as is shown
below, these modes can be detected in TPP.

The calculations show that all the IRQM are almost
pure 1eh states, i.e. are dominated by one 1eh compo-
nent (with the related transition in Fig. 4. The con-
tributions of the dominant components typically attain
99 − 100%. Even in λµ =21 states in Na+
15, which most
deviate from the 1eh nature, the contribution of the
leading 1eh component are 92-93%. This feature is ad-
ditionally illustrated in Fig. 6 where the unperturbed
(the dominant 1eh conﬁguration alone) and RPA IRQM
strengths are compared. One sees that in both cases
IRQM spectra and strengths are very similar. Only the
λµ =21 states in Na+
15 show considerable redistribution
of the strength (keeping, nevertheless, predominantly 1eh
structure). This case anticipates the involved picture
for heavier clusters where the collective redistribution of
strength is much stronger.

The second panel in Fig. 5 exhibits the photoabsorp-
tion cross section for the dipole magnetic SM. The one-to-
one correspondence between E21 and M11 peaks demon-
strates the intimate connection between these two modes.
As is discussed in Appendix B, the scissors mode is
driven by cluster deformation and vanishes in the spher-
ical case. Two λµ =21 states in Na+
15 represent an in-
structive example. The lower λµ =21 state determined
by [211] → [202] transition between the members of the
deformation multiplet exhibits an appreciable magnetic
dipole strength and thus should carry a large SM frac-
tion. Instead, the higher λµ =21 state is determined by
a [211] → [200] transition which takes place even in the
spherical case. The deformation is not crucial here. This
state favors the E21 ﬁeld and so can be treated as an
ordinary quadrupole mode. Altogether, it is seen that
deformation-induced IRQM provide access to SM.

The third and fourth panels in Fig. 5 show the TPP
cross-section for the reaction paths via λµ = 10 and 11
branches of the dipole plasmon. It is seen that TPP re-
sponse considerably deviates from the photoabsorption.
Besides, the population of IRQM crucially depends on
the reaction path. For example, it is negligible for λµ =21
states in Na+
15 (path 11). Suppression
of the TPP transfer in these cases is explained by destruc-
tive eﬀects in the photoemission dipole matrix element
(see discussion in Appendix A). This matrix element can
vary to a large extent, depending on the particular struc-

7 (path 10) and Na+

ture of IRQM and dipole intermediate states. So, for the
eﬃcient population of the particular IRQM, one has to
choose the most optimal TPP path. The microscopic
calculations can be used here as a guide.

Because of the 1eh nature of IRQM and their strong
dependence on cluster deformation, they can deliver a
valuable spectroscopic information on the electron levels
in the HOMO-LUMO region as well as on the deforma-
tion eﬀects in the cluster mean ﬁeld. For example, the
measurement for λµ =21 state in Na+
7 can provide the
energy diﬀerence between the Fermi [101] and particle
[110] levels (see Fig. 4). If to deduce the Fermi level en-
ergy from the ionization potential data, one ﬁnally gets
the energy of [110] level. Simultaneously we will estimate
the deformation splitting of the active subshell. The anal-
ysis will be even more eﬀective, if to combine the TPP
data with the photoemission and inverse photoemission
results for the electron spectra.

V. EXPERIMENTAL ACCESS TO IRQM

A. General view

Two-photon processes are widely used in atomic and
molecular physics (for a comprehensive discussion see
[32]). Since atomic clusters are similar to molecules, it
would be natural to use the same reactions in clusters.
However, applications of TPP to clusters are very scarce.
This can be partly explained by our poor knowledge on
non-dipole low-energy electron modes in clusters, partly
by peculiarities of clusters. In this section we will discuss
applicability of traditional TPP methods to clusters with
a particular accent to IRQM.

As compared with atoms and molecules, atomic clus-
ters have at least three features essential for TPP. i)
The dominant decay channel in clusters is usually not
radiative. Instead, the levels mainly decay through Lan-
dau fragmentation (dissipation of the collective motion
through surrounding 1eh excitation), electron-electron
collisions, and electron-ion coupling. This property spoils
the radiation-based methods (typical for atomic and
molecular measurements) to detect population of levels
in clusters.
In this connection, we will propose an al-
ternative detection method based on the photoabsorp-
tion depletion of cluster beam, which is more suitable
for clusters. ii) Cluster excitations have extremely short
lifetimes (10-20 fs for the dipole plasmon in medium clus-
ters) and usually are rather broad (see e.g. Fig. 1 for the
dipole plasmon). The short lifetimes inhibit the applica-
tion of adiabatic transfer methods while large widths im-
pede maintaining the resonance conditions. iii) Clusters
demonstrate a strong shape isomerism. Cluster beams
are usually a statistical mix of clusters of a diﬀerent
shape. This blurs the measured low-energy electron spec-
tra.

Light clusters with their dilute spectrum allow to cir-

cumvent some of these troubles.

mentation in such clusters is very weak, the levels not so
broad and the lifetimes are much longer. Light clusters
are strictly dominated by one equilibrium shape and their
isomeric shapes are close to the ground state one [22]. So,
we do not expect a strong blurring of the low-energy spec-
tra. Beams of size-selected singly-charged light clusters
are readily available. The light deformed singly-charged
clusters considered in this paper seem to be most suit-
able for TPP measurements. The cluster temperature ∼
100 K could be optimal. Then the thermal broadening of
electron levels is small and, at the same time, the eﬀects
of the electron-ion coupling are yet smoothed.

In the next subsections we will consider some typical
two-photon processes (RS, SEP, STIRAP) and estimate
their ability to observe IRQM.

B. Raman scattering

RS is one of the simplest TPP. In this reaction, a
dipole laser-induced transition to an intermediate elec-
tronic level (real or virtual) is followed by the dipole ﬂu-
orescence to low-energy levels.

RS measurements of electron infrared modes in clus-
ters are very rare. We know only one experiment where
IRQM were observed in heavy silver clusters embedded
into amorphous silica ﬁlms [19]. The dipole plasmon was
used as a resonant intermediate state. The further mea-
surements revealed that IRQM are aﬀected by cluster de-
formation [36]. These observations show that the radia-
tive decay of the dipole plasmon is detectable in spite of
the strong competition with other decay channels. This
message is very encouraging for application of TPP to
clusters.

RS generally assumes that the coupling between the
intermediate dipole and ﬁnal quadrupole states is of the
same order of magnitude as the coupling between the in-
termediate and ground states. Only then the ﬁnal state is
successfully populated. This means that the absorption
and emission dipole matrix elements deﬁned in (A3) and
(A5) should be of the same scale. The calculations show
that this is indeed the case: in the clusters considered in
the present paper most of the absorption and emission
dipole matrix elements lie inside the interval 2-10 ea0 (in
atomic units), i.e. are basically of the same order of mag-
nitude (for exception of some emission matrix elements
strictly suppressed due to destructive contributions, see
discussion in Appendix A). This means that IRQM in
light deformed clusters have a chance to be observed in
the resonant RS (running via the dipole plasmon).

RS is eﬀective only if the coupling between intermedi-
ate and desirable target levels is strong enough. As was
shown for Na+
7 , this is not always the case. To overcome
this trouble, we should consider the methods with stimu-
lated emission into a speciﬁc target level (SEP, STIRAP).

C. Stimulated emission pumping

Unlike RS, this method exploits two lasers, pump and
dump [33]. The pump laser is responsible for the ﬁrst
photoabsorption step. The dump pulse follows the pump
one with some delay and couples intermediate to target
states. If the diﬀerence between the pump and dump fre-
quencies is in resonance with the frequency of the target
state, then the dump radiation stimulates the emission
to this state.

SEP enjoys widespread application for atoms and
molecules but can encounter troubles for clusters where
SEP methods to detect the population (based on mea-
surement of spontaneous photoemission or photoelectron
yield from certain levels excited by probe lasers) can fail
for short-lived cluster levels with their small radiative
width. In this connection, we propose a new detection
method which does not need any probe radiative proce-
dure.

The idea is to use depletion of cluster beam caused
by the photoabsorption. It is known that photoabsorp-
tion heats the clusters leading to subsequent evaporation
of atoms. The recoil eﬀect from the evaporated atom
forces the cluster to leave the beam. Thus the photoab-
sorption can be measured in terms of depletion. In the
scheme we propose, the frequency of the pump laser is
ﬁxed in resonance with the dipole plasmon while the fre-
quency of the dump laser scans to get the resonance with
IRQM at ωP − ωD = ωIRQM . Then one can detect the
IRQM population as a dark resonance in the beam de-
pletion. Indeed if the dump pulse is not in the resonance
with IRQM, then a usual photoabsorption induced by the
pump laser and additionally supported by the dump laser
takes place. In the case of the resonance with IRQM, part
of the energy will be used not for cluster heating but
for stimulated radiative decay from the dipole plasmon
to the given IRQM. So, the photoabsorption (depletion)
should demonstrate a sharp decrease, kind of a dark res-
onance. The deeper the dark resonance, the more popu-
lated is the IRQM. The photoionization channel plays no
role because the ionization potential in light clusters is
higher than ωP + ωD. If the laser intensities are not too
high, then multi-photon ionization can be also neglected.
The scheme is simple and suitable for clusters.

However, even in the best case, SEP can transfer to
the target level only 25% of the population [33]. Spon-
taneous emission from the intermediate level results in
an additional leaking. So, it is worth to continue our
discussion and consider more eﬃcient methods.

D. STIRAP

Much better results can be obtained with STIRAP [34,
35] which promises up to 100% of the population transfer
from the initial to the target level. So high eﬀectivity is
provided by the coherent character of the process and
the principle possibility to avoid the leaking from the

6

intermediate levels. Like the previous method, STIRAP
also implements two lasers: pump laser to couple the
initial state |0 > and intermediate state |1 > and Stokes
laser to stimulate the emission from |1 > to the target
state |2 >. However, STIRAP is more involved because
it implies the coherent adiabatic transfer.

STIRAP has three principle requirements:

i) two-
resonance condition ωP − ωS = ω2 − ω0 which allows
a detuning ∆ = (ω1 − ω0) − ωP = (ω1 − ω2) − ωS from
the intermediate state frequency; ii) counterintuitive se-
quence of the pulses when the Stokes pulse proceeds the
pump one; 3) adiabatic evolution.

Under these conditions, one of the time-dependent
eigenfunctions of the system is a superposition of ini-
tial and target bare states only:
|b0(t) >= c0(t)|0 >
It is reduced to |0 > at the beginning of
+c2(t)|2 >.
the adiabatic evolution and to |2 > at the end. Hence,
the system ﬁnally ﬁnds itself in the target state. The
intermediate state |1 > is not involved to |b0(t) > and so
is not populated at any time. Thus any leak in the popu-
lation is avoided and the transfer is complete. The main
point is to evolve the system adiabatically, keeping it all
the time in the state |b0(t) >. STIRAP is widely used in
atomic and molecular spectroscopy. It is rather insensi-
tive to precise pulse characteristics. Both continuous and
pulse lasers can be implemented.

Let’s examine the STIRAP requirements for atomic
clusters, in particular for the IRQM population via the
dipole plasmon.

Two-resonance condition. This condition can be obvi-
ously maintained even for a broad dipole plasmon. How-
ever, the role of detuning ∆ (which is used as an addi-
tional tool to prevent the |1 > admixture to |b0(t) >)
becomes vague. The dipole plasmon vanishes slowly at
its ﬂanks and so rather large detuning is necessary. This
can be done even under the restriction ∆ ≪ ωP ± ωS im-
posed by the rotation wave approximation. At the same
time, this point was not yet properly investigated and,
probably, some fraction of |1 > will admix |b0(t) >. Then
the population will not be complete, although it still can
remain large.

Counterintuitive order of pump and Stokes pulses. The
order when Stokes pulse precedes the pump one is cru-
cial for the maximal population [34, 35]. Then the Stokes
pulse prepares the coherent superposition of the interme-
diate and ﬁnal states just before arriving the pump pulse
to stimulate the subsequent desirable transfer. Stokes
and pump pulses must overlap and the overlapping time
∆τ determines duration of the adiabatic evolution. This
time should not be longer than the lifetime of the dipole
plasmon, i.e. should not exceed 10-100 fs. Though such
∆τ is extremely short, it is quite accessible in modern
experiments [33].

Adiabatic passage. This condition is most tough. Fol-

lowing [34, 35] it can be formulated as

Ω∆τ > 10

(2)

where Ω =

Ω2

P + Ω2

S is the average of the pump and

p

Stokes Rabi frequencies. The Rabi frequency is [34]

(3)

where d is the dipole coupling matrix element in atomic
units, I is the laser intensity in W/cm2, c is the light
speed, ǫ0 is the vacuum dielectric constant. It is easy to
estimate (for d ∼ 5ea0 and ∆τ =10 fs) that the condition
(2) is maintained for intensities I > 1012 W/cm2. At so
high intensities, the multiphoton ionization and fragmen-
tation of clusters should take place [13], which can spoil
STIRAP.

However, there is a way to circumvent the trouble. The
condition (2) was obtained for one intermediate level.
But the realistic spectrum of the dipole plasmon consists
of a sequence of dipole levels. In this case, the STIRAP
condition should be revised. The realistic case is more
complicated but, at the same time, opens new possibil-
ities for STIRAP. In particular, one may loose the adi-
abatic STIRAP condition and thus the requirements for
the laser intensity.

A general case of N intermediate states, each with its
own coupling and detuning was studied in [37]. It was
shown that the trapped adiabatic state |b0(t) > can be
created only when the ratio between each pump coupling
and the respective Stokes coupling is the same for all in-
termediate states. Following our calculations, this condi-
tion is unrealistic for atomic clusters. However, the softer
alternative adiabatic requirements can be formulated. In
particular, in the general case of arbitrary couplings, one
may tune the pump and Stokes lasers just below all inter-
mediate states and thus form so called adiabatic-transfer
state which also results in a high if not complete popu-
lation of the target level. Unlike |b0(t) >, the adiabatic-
transfer state can have admixtures from the intermediate
states during the evolution period ∆τ and so some popu-
lation leaking is unavoidable. Nevertheless, we have here
a solid adiabatic transfer with a high population of the
target state. Finally, one may conclude that STIRAP can
be used for the eﬃcient population of IRQM in clusters.

We have presented a ﬁrst exploration of

infrared
quadrupole electron modes (IRQM) in light deformed
clusters. Most of IRQM are induced by cluster deforma-
tion and thus can deliver useful information on deforma-
tion eﬀects, e.g. on the deformation splitting of electron
levels. Besides, IRQM are about pure one-electron-one-
hole excitations and so give access to the single-electron
spectrum. We explained the origin of IRQM and showed
that they can be easily identiﬁed in the dilute spectrum
of light clusters.

In the second part, we examined some typical two-
photon processes (Raman scattering, stimulated emission
population and stimulated adiabatic Raman passage)

7

which are widely used in atomic and molecular spec-
troscopy but not yet for atomic clusters. It was shown
that, in spite of some peculiarities of clusters (broad reso-
nances, short level lifetimes, domination of non-radiative
decay channels), these TPP can be applied to populate
IRQM. Besides, a new method to detect the population
of the target cluster states was proposed. TPP mea-
surements of IRQM can be supplemented by photoemis-
sion and inverse photoemission experiments delivering
the similar information. We hope that our analysis will
stimulate application of the experimental TPP methods
of atomic and molecular spectroscopy to atomic clusters.
Non-dipole electron excitations in clusters represent a
new promising research ﬁeld. They deliver interesting
physics and can serve as a robust test for the theory
which still paid main attention to integral characteristics
of clusters but not to so fragile patterns as the single-
electron spectra. It worth noting that the single-electron
spectra are very sensitive to many cluster features and so
can be used as an eﬀective tool for investigation of these
features.

Though our calculations have been done for sodium
clusters, the qualitative results we obtained are of a gen-
eral nature and should be valid for other metal clusters
as well. In particular, similar deformation-induced IRQM
are expected for supported clusters where they can serve
as sensitive indicators of the interface interaction and
cluster deformation. Besides, IRQM can be important
for the quantum transport in clusters where they can
lead to a resonant transmission.

and it is easy to see that all 1eh levels contribute con-

Instead, the photoemission dipole matrix element con-

mined by 1ee and 1hh parts of the dipole operator and
has the more complicated structure:

The terms with backward amplitudes, ∼ φφ, are omitted
in (A5) since they are usually small.

The matrix element (A5) becomes simpler when the
quadrupole state is dominated by a single 1eh conﬁgura-
tion, say {¯e2¯h2}. As is shown in Sec. IV, this is indeed a
common case. Then all the quadrupole amplitudes van-
ish except of |ψ2µ2i2

Now only the dipole amplitudes including the hole (ﬁrst
term) or particle (second term) from the pair {¯e2¯h2}
contribute to the transition. The contribution is con-
siderable only subject to the large dipole amplitude and
strong matrix element. (The latter take place if the ma-
trix element fulﬁlls the asymptotic Nilsson selection rules
[27, 28]: E1µ transition between [NinizΛi] and [NjnjzΛj]
states is favored if Ni = Nj ± 1, niz = njz ± 1 for µ = 0
and
niz = njz for µ = 1). Under these tough require-
ments, only a few terms yield large contributions to (A6).
Depending on the structure of the dipole and quadrupole
states, the contributions can have diﬀerent signs and thus
lead to constructive or destructive results. So, the mag-
nitude of the photoemission matrix element (and thus
the coupling between the dipole and quadrupole states)
can be large (like for the photoabsorption) or very small.

APPENDIX B: SCISSORS MODE

The SM is a general dynamical phenomenon already
found or predicted in diﬀerent ﬁnite quantum systems
(atomic nuclei, metal clusters, quantum dots, dilute
ultra-cold gases of Bose and Fermi atoms), see the re-
view [12]. All these diﬀerent systems have two features
in common: broken spherical symmetry (deformation)
and a two-component structure.

Like the quadrupole modes, the SM separates into low-
energy (∆N = 0) and high-energy (∆N = 2) branches.
In this paper we consider only the low-energy branch
which is mixed with IRQM. Macroscopically, this branch
is treated as a small-amplitude rotational oscillations of
a spheroid of valence electrons against a spheroid of the
ionic background (hence the name scissors mode). Like
IRQM, the SM is driven by cluster deformation and its
energy scale is naturally determined by the deformation
splitting of the electron levels.
In axial clusters with
a quadrupole deformation δ2, the energy and magnetic
strength of the mode are estimated as [9, 10]:

ω =

20.7
r2
s

N −1/3
e

δ2 eV,

B(M 1) ≃ N 4/3

e

δ2 µ2
b

(B1)

where rs is the Wigner-Seitz radius (in ˚A), Ne is the
number of valence electrons, and µb is the Bohr mag-
neton. It is seen that both the energy and strength are
proportional to the deformation parameter δ2 and vanish
for the spherical shape.

In axially symmetric systems, the SM is generated by
the orbital momentum ﬁelds, Lx and Ly, perpendicular
to the symmetry axis z and, like the quadrupole mode
λµ = 21, forms the states |Λπ = 1+ >. SM strongly
responds to an external magnetic dipole ﬁeld. Besides,
it determines the van Vleck paramagnetism in deformed
clusters [9, 10, 11, 12]. The experimental search of the
SM in clusters is still in very beginning [19].

There is an intimate connection between the scissors
and quadrupole E21 modes in deformed clusters. If fact,
both SM and E21 mode are parts of a general motion
of multipolarity λµ = 21. To illustrate this point, we
expand a single-particle electron state ν in terms of a
spherical basis (nLΛ)

Ψν=[N nzΛ] =

aν
nLRnL(r)YLΛ(Ω)

(B2)

XnL

and estimate the SM 1eh matrix element:

hΨp| ˆLx|Ψhi ∝ δπp,πhδΛp,Λh±1
·

ap
nLah

nL

XnL

p

(B3)

L(L+1)−Λh(Λh±1) .

It is seen that the SM operator connects only compo-
nents from one and the same basis level nL. Indeed, the
operators ˆLx and ˆLy have no r-dependent part and so,
due to orthogonality of the basis functions RnL(r), can-
not connect the components with diﬀerent nL. But the

latter can be done by the quadrupole operator r2Y21. In
this sense the SM operator is more selective than E21,
though both operators generate transitions of the same
multipolarity. Λπ = 1+ states involve both SM and E21

modes and respond to both M11 and E21 external ﬁelds.
The states are treated as magnetic dipole SM or electric
quadrupole E21, depending on each of the two responses
dominates.

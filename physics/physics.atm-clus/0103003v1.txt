Abstract

A partial diﬀerential eigenvalue equation for the density displacement ﬁelds

associated with electronic resonances is derived in the framework of density

functional theory. Our quantum ﬂuid-dynamical approach is based on a varia-

tional principle and the Kohn-Sham ground-state energy functional. It allows

for an intuitive interpretation of electronic excitations in terms of intrinsic lo-

cal currents that obey a continuity equation. We demonstrate the capabilities

of our approach by calculating the photoabsorption spectra of small sodium

clusters. The quantitative agreement between theoretical and experimental

spectra shows that even for the smallest clusters, the resonances observed

experimentally at low temperatures can be interpreted in terms of density

vibrations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Since its formal foundation as a theory of ground-state properties [1], density functional

theory has developed into one of the most successful methods of modern many-body theory,

today also with well-established extensions such as, e.g., time-dependent [2] and current [3,4]

density-functional theory (DFT). In particular in the ﬁeld of metal cluster physics, DFT

calculations have contributed substantially to a qualitative and quantitative description of

both ground and excited state properties [5,6]. Understanding the properties of small metal

particles in turn oﬀers technological opportunities, e.g., to better control catalysis [7], as

well as fundamental insights into how matter grows [8,9]. Since the electronic and geometric

structure of metal particles consisting of only a few atoms still cannot be measured directly,

photoabsorption spectra are their most accurate probes. Especially the spectra of charged

sodium clusters have been measured with high accuracy for a broad range of cluster sizes

and temperatures [10]. A distinct feature of these spectra is that at elevated temperatures of

several hundred K, in particular for the larger clusters, only a few broad peaks are observed,

whereas at lower temperatures (100 K and less), a greater number of sharp lines can be

resolved for clusters with only a few atoms. The peaks observed in the high-temperature

experiments found an early and intuitive explanation as collective excitations in analogy

to the bulk plasmon and the giant resonances in nuclei: diﬀerent peaks in the spectrum

were understood as belonging to the diﬀerent spatial directions of the collective motion of

the valence electrons with respect to the inert ionic background. On the other hand, the

sharp lines observed in the low-temperature experiments were interpreted as a hallmark of

the molecule-like properties of the small clusters explicable, in the language of quantum

chemistry [11], only in terms of transitions between molecular states.

In this work we present a density functional approach to the calculation of excitations

that leads us to a uniﬁed and transparent physical understanding of the photoabsorption

spectra of sodium clusters. We ﬁrst derive a general variational principle for the energy

spectrum of an interacting many-body system. From this, we derive an approximate solution

2

in the form of quantum ﬂuid-dynamical diﬀerential equations for the density displacement

ﬁelds associated with the electronic vibrations around their ground state. By solving these

equations, we obtain the eigenmodes within the DFT; hereby only the ground-state energy

functional and the occupied Kohn-Sham orbitals are required. We demonstrate the accuracy

of our approach by calculating the photoabsorption spectra of small sodium clusters and

comparing our results to low-temperature experiments and to conﬁguration-interaction (CI)

calculations. In this way we can show that also the spectra of the smallest clusters can be

understood, without knowledge of the molecular many-body wavefunction, in an intuitive

picture of oscillations of the valence-electron density against the ionic background.

II. A VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE

Starting point for the derivation of the variational principle is the well-known fact that

for a many-body system described by a Hamiltonian H with ground state |0i and energy E0,

the creation and annihilation operators of all the eigenstates obey the so-called equations of

motion for excitation operators [12]

h0|Oν[H, O†

ν]|0i = ~ωνh0|OνO†

ν|0i

h0|Oν[H, Oν]|0i = ~ωνh0|OνOν|0i = 0,

where Oν and O†

ν are deﬁned by

O†

ν|0i = |νi, Oν|νi = |0i,

and Oν|0i = 0.

(1)

(2)

(3)

Of course, the exact solution of these equations are in general unknown. But a variety of

approximations to the true excited states can be derived from them, e.g., the Tam-Dancoﬀ

scheme and the small amplitude limit of time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory (RPA). As

discussed in [12], also higher-order approximations can be obtained.

Related to these equations, we derive the following variational principle: solving the

equations (1) and (2) for the lowest excited state is equivalent to solving the variational

equation

and m1 and m3 are the multiple commutators

m3[Q] =

h0| [[H, Q] , [[H, Q] , H]] |0i.

Hereby Q is some general Hermitean operator that, as will be shown in the course of the

argument [see Eq. (15) below], can be interpreted as a generalized coordinate. The minimum

energy E3 after the variation gives the ﬁrst excitation energy ~ω1. The second excitation

with energy ~ω2 can be obtained from variation in an operator space which has been or-

thogonalized to the minimum Q, and in this way the whole spectrum ~ων can be calculated.

The variation δQ of an operator can be understood as a variation of the matrix elements

of the operator in the matrix mechanics picture. Therefore,

Since |0i by deﬁnition is the exact ground state of H, and (13) must hold for any δQ, the

[H, [H, Q]] − (~ω1)2 Q

|0i = 0

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

is obtained. It resembles the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator. Therefore, Q is

interpreted as a generalized coordinate, and in analogy to the well-known algebraic way of

solving the harmonic oscillator problem, Q is written as a linear combination

of the creation and annihilation operator for the ﬁrst excited state. Inserting (15) into (14)

leads to the two equations

Q ∝ O†

1 + O1

[H, [H, O†

1]]|0i = (~ω1)2O†

1|0i

[H, [H, O1]] |0i = (~ω1)2O1|0i = 0.

First consider (16). After closing with state h1|, one exploits that, by deﬁnition, |0i and |1i

are eigenstates of H and evaluates the outer commutator by letting H act once to the left

and once to the right. Recalling that h1| = h0|O1, one ﬁnally obtains

h0|O1[H, O†

1]|0i = ~ω1h0|O1O†

1|0i.

This is exactly equation (1) for the ﬁrst excited state. In the same way, (2) is obtained from

(17), which completes the derivation of the variational principle.

We would like to point out that in earlier work [13], the RPA equations have been derived

with a related technique that made use of both generalized coordinate and momentum

operators. The advantage of our present derivation is that – although within linear response

theory – it goes beyond RPA and, due to the formulation in terms of a generalized coordinate

only, is particularly suitable for the formulation of the variational principle in the framework

of density functional theory as shown below.

III. QUANTUM FLUID DYNAMICS FROM THE GROUND-STATE ENERGY

FUNCTIONAL: A LOCAL CURRENT APPROXIMATION

In principle, the exact eigenenergies are deﬁned via Eqs. (1), (2) by the variational

equation (4), provided that the operator Q is chosen in a suﬃciently general form. However,

just as in the equations of motion technique, one is forced to make some explicit ansatz for

the form of Q, which necessarily introduces approximations. In Ref. [13] it was shown that

if Q is taken to be a one-particle-one-hole excitation operator, Eq. (4) leads to the RPA

equations. Simpliﬁcations of the RPA, in which Q was chosen from restricted sets of local

operators Qn(r), were proposed in connection with both semiclassical [14] and Kohn-Sham

density functionals [13]. In the present paper, we derive a set of quantum ﬂuid-dynamical

equations from the variational principle (4) by choosing Q to a general local operator Q(r).

These equations are then solved without any restriction other than Eq. (23) below.

First we recall a relation that is well known in nuclear physics [15]: the commutator of

Eq. (7) can be exactly obtained from

and |αi the state that results from the unitary transformation

S = [H, Q]

(19)

(20)

|αi = e−αS|0i,

with α being a real and possibly time-dependent parameter. Assuming that Q is just a

function of r and that the potentials in H do not contain derivatives with respect to r, as is

the case for Coulombic systems, Eq. (20) is easily evaluated:

S =

(∇iu(ri)) + u(ri) · ∇i.

Here, the displacement ﬁeld

has been introduced, and Ne is the number of electrons.

These equations can be related to DFT by noting that, ﬁrst, we can introduce a set of

single particle orbitals {ψµ(ri)}, and from the scaled single particle orbitals, a scaled single

particle density can be constructed via

n(r, α) =

showing that m1 depends only on n and u and is similar to a ﬂuid-dynamical inertial

parameter. And third, we replace the expectation value in Eq. (19) by

Eq. (26) is exact and also Eq. (24) can be veriﬁed order by order, but Eq. (27) goes beyond

the safe grounds on which the energy functional is deﬁned. However, the replacement of

an energy expectation value by the energy functional is intuitively very plausible, and its

practical validity can be judged a posteriori by the results. A further strong argument for

why really the density should be the basic variable can be made by calculating the derivative

with respect to time of the scaled density, using Eqs. (24) and (25),

d
dt

n(r, α(t)) = −Sn ˙α(t) n(r, α(t)) = −∇[ ˙α(t) u(r) n(r, α(t))],

(29)

where for the sake of clarity we now explicitly wrote the time dependence of α. Since

j(r, t) = ˙α(t) u(r) n(r, α(t)),

(30)

is a current density, Eq. (29) is just the continuity equation dn(r, α(t))/dt + ∇j(r, t) = 0.

Thus, the variational principle Eq. (4) with a local function Q(r) describes excitations by

intrinsic local currents. The time dependence of the parameter α is obviously harmonic, i.e.,

α(t) ∝ cos(ωνt), since the present derivation is based on linear response theory.

The physical signiﬁcance of the variational approach now being clear, it remains to derive

the actual equations that determine the displacement ﬁelds u(r) and the energies ~ω that

are associated with particular excitations. Starting from Eq. (10) and using an explicit

notation,

follows by virtue of the chain rule for functional derivatives. Thus, solutions of

δm3[u(r)]
δu(r′)

= (~ω1)2 δm1[u(r)]
δu(r′)

will also be solutions to Eq. (10) and thus Eq. (4). m1 is already given as the functional

m1[u] by Eq. (26), and m3[u] is readily obtained by inserting the scaled Kohn-Sham orbitals

and density from Eq. (24) into the energy functional Eq. (28) and calculating the second

8

(cid:27)

(31)

(32)

derivative with respect to the parameter α, Eq. (27). The ﬁnal equations are then derived in

a lengthy but straightforward calculation from Eq. (32) by explicitly performing the variation

on u. Using the usual deﬁnition

where we used the shorthand notation ∂1 = ∂/∂x etc., and indicated the terms to which

derivatives refer by including them in parenthesis. The usual Kohn-Sham and exchange-

correlation potential are denoted by vKS and vxc, respectively.

Eqs. (34) – (40) are our quantum ﬂuid-dynamical equations.

In analogy to the local

density approximation (LDA) used for vxc, we term our scheme the local current approxi-

mation (LCA) to the dynamics, due to the use of a local function Q(r) in the variational

principle (4). It should be noted that the above equations diﬀer from the equations derived

earlier in a semiclassical approximation [14] or by explicit particle-hole averaging [13]. Due

to the fact that our approach is completely based on the Kohn-Sham density functional and

therefore contains the full quantum-mechanical shell eﬀects in the ground-state density, it is

also diﬀerent from some ﬂuid-dynamical approaches developed in nuclear physics [16] (and

used in cluster physics [17]) which involved either schematic liquid-drop model densities or

semiclassical densities derived from an extended Thomas-Fermi model.

Although Eqs. (34) – (40) look rather formidable, they can be solved numerically with

reasonable computational eﬀort, and we have done so for the sodium clusters Na2 and Na+
5 .

The Kohn-Sham equations were solved basis-set free on a three-dimensional Cartesian real-

space grid using the damped gradient iteration with multigrid relaxation [18]. The ionic

coordinates were obtained by minimizing the total energy using a smooth-core pseudopo-

tential [9]. For Exc, we employed the LDA functional of Ref. [19]. The uj(r) were expanded

in harmonic oscillator wavefunctions and we explicitly enforced Eq. (23). The convergence

rate of the expansion can be improved by adding a few polynomial functions to the basis.

By multiplying Eqs. (32) and subsequently (34)–(40) from the left with u and integrating

over all space, a matrix equation for the expansion coeﬃcients is obtained which can be

solved using library routines. The square roots of the eigenvalues then give the excitation

energies and from the eigenvectors, the oscillator strengths can be computed.

Fig. 1 shows the experimental photoabsorption spectrum [20] of Na2 in the upper left

picture (adapted from Ref. [6]), and below the spectrum obtained in the just described LCA.

We introduced a phenomenological line broadening in the LCA results to guide the eye. The

10

LCA correctly reproduces the electronic transitions, despite the fact that only two electrons

are involved. Due to Eq. (29), one can very easily visualize how the electrons move in a

particular excitation by plotting the corresponding ∇j(r), giving a “snapshot” picture of

dn/dt. For the two main excitations, a crossection of this quantity along the symmetry axis

(z axis) is shown in the lower left and upper right contourplots, and the ground-state valence

electron density is shown in the lower right for reference. In the plots of dn/dt, shadings

darker than the background grey indicate a density increase, lighter shadings indicate a

decrease.

It becomes clear that the lower excitation corresponds to a density oscillation

along the z axis whereas the higher excitation corresponds to two energetically degenerate

oscillations perpendicular to the symmetry axis. (For the sake of clarity, we plotted the

corresponding oscillator strengths on top of each other in the photoabsorption spectrum.)

This is exactly what one would have expected intuitively. But the plots reveal that besides

the expected general charge transfer from one end of the cluster to the other, the presence

of the ionic cores hinders the valence electrons to be shifted freely, creating a density shift

of reverse sign in between the ionic cores.

Fig. 2 shows the ionic ground-state conﬁguration of Na+

5 with our labeling of axes in the

upper left, the experimental low-temperature (≈ 100 K) photoabsorption spectrum [10] in

the upper right, the LCA photoabsorption spectrum in the lower left, and the CI spectrum

adapted from Ref. [11] in the lower right. Again, a phenomenological line broadening was

introduced in the presentation of both the LCA and the CI results. The LCA spectrum

again is in close agreement with the experimentally observed spectrum, showing three intense

transitions. With our choice of the coordinate system, the lowest excitation corresponds to

a density oscillation in z direction, whereas the two higher excitations oscillate in both x

and y directions. In the interpretation of the LCA results, it must be kept in mind that due

to our ﬁnite grid spacing the numerical accuracy for the excitation energies is about 0.03 eV,

which is absolutely suﬃcient in the light of the physical approximations that we are making.

But due to this ﬁnite numerical resolution and the fact that we evaluate each direction of

oscillation separately, the x and y components of the excitations at 2.7 eV and 3.4 eV, which

11

really should be degenerate for symmetry reasons, appear as extremely close-lying double

lines. However, since the symmetry of the cluster was in no way an input to our calculation,

it is a reassuring test that the LCA, indeed, fulﬁlls the symmetry requirement within the

numerical accuracy. Furthermore, it is reassuring to see that with respect to the relative

heights of the peaks the LCA is very close to the CI results, with diﬀerences observed only in

the small subpeaks that are not seen experimentally anyway. And small diﬀerences to the CI

calculation are already to be expected simply because of the use of diﬀerent pseudopotentials

and the resulting small diﬀerences in the ionic ground-state structure.

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have derived a set of quantum ﬂuid-dynamical equations from a general

variational principle for the excitations of a many-body system. The equations describe

here the eigenmodes of the system’s (valence) electrons and require only the knowledge of

the occupied ground-state Kohn-Sham orbitals. From these equations, we have computed

the photoabsorption spectra for small sodium clusters and ﬁnd quantitative agreement with

the experimentally observed peak positions. Thus, even low-temperature photoabsorption

spectra can be understood in an intuitive picture of density oscillations, without knowledge

of the true (or any approximate) many-body wavefunction.

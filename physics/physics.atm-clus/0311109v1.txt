isomer structure of the parent cluster is analyzed. It is demonstrated that the energy
necessary for removing homothetic groups of atoms from the parent cluster is largely
independent of the isomer form of the parent cluster. Importance of rearrangement
of the cluster structure during the ﬁssion process is elucidated. This rearrangement
may include transition to another isomer state of the parent cluster before actual
separation of the daughter fragments begins and/or forming a ”neck” between the
separating fragments.

Fission of charged atomic clusters occurs when repulsive Coulomb forces, arising due
to the excessive charge, overcome the electronic binding energy of the cluster [1, 2, 3].
This mechanism of the cluster ﬁssion is in a great deal similar to the nuclear ﬁssion
phenomena. Experimentally, multiply charged metal clusters can be observed in the
mass spectra when their size exceeds the critical size of stability, which depends on the
metal species and cluster charge [4, 5, 6].

3 and Na2+

We report the results of the ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of
the ﬁssion processes Na2+
9 . Both symmetric and
asymmetric ﬁssion channels are considered. We have investigated the parent cluster
isomer dependence of the ﬁssion barrier for the reaction Na2+
3 . To
the best of our knowledge, a comparative study of ﬁssion barriers for various isomers
by means of quantum chemistry methods has not been carried out before. Note that
such a study is beyond the scope of simpler approaches which do not account for ionic
structure of a cluster.

We found that the direct separation barrier for the reaction Na2+

7 + Na+
3
has a weak dependence on the isomeric structure of the parent cluster. We note, however,
that the groups of atoms to be removed from the parent cluster isomers must be chosen
with care; one has to identify homothetic groups of atoms in each ﬁssioning isomer.
The weak dependence on the isomeric state of the parent Na2+
10 cluster implies that
the particular ionic structure of the cluster is largely insigniﬁcant for the shape and
height of the ﬁssion barrier. This is due to the fact that the maximum of ﬁssion barriers
in considered cases are located at distances comparable or exceeding the sum of the
resulting fragments radii. At such distances the interaction between the fragments,
apart from the Coulombic repulsion, is mainly determined by the electronic properties
rather than by the details of the ionic structure of the fragments. This is an important
argument for justiﬁcation of the jellium model approach to the description of the ﬁssion
process of multiply charged metal clusters.

We have demonstrated the importance of rearrangement of the cluster ionic
structure during the ﬁssion process. The possibility of rearrangement of the cluster
structure leads to the fact that direct ﬁssion of a cluster isomer in some cases may not
be the energetically optimum path for the ﬁssion reaction. Alternatively, the reaction
can go through transition to another isomer state of the parent cluster. This transition
can occur in the ﬁrst phase of the ﬁssion process, before separation of the fragments
actually begins. We show that this is the case for the ﬁssion of C4v and D4d isomers of
Na2+

10 cluster.

The rearrangement of ionic structure may be important also after the fragments
began to separate. For Na2+
9 form a
metastable transitional state in which the fragments are connected by a ”neck”. This
”necking” allows for signiﬁcant reduction in the height of the ﬁssion barrier. Note that
the similar necking phenomenon is known for the nuclear ﬁssion process [7].

where the ﬁrst term corresponds to the kinetic energy of an electron from the Kohn-
Sham reference system, Ui describes the attraction of the ith electron to the nuclei in
the cluster, ψi is the electronic orbital, VH is the Hartree part of the inter-electronic
interaction,

ρ(r) is the electron density, Vxc is the local exchange-correlation potential deﬁned as the
functional derivative of the exchange-correlation energy functional

where the exchange-correlation energy is partitioned into two parts, referred to as
exchange and correlation parts:

Physically, these two terms correspond to same-spin and mixed-spin interactions,
respectively. Both parts are functionals of the electron density, which can be of two
distinct types: either a local functional depending on the electron density ρ only or a
gradient-corrected functional depending on the electron density and its gradient ∇ρ.

There is a variety of exchange-correlation functionals in the literature. We have
used the three-parameter Becke-type gradient-corrected exchange functional with the
gradient-corrected correlation functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr (B3LYP) [9]. For the
explicit form of this functional we refer to the original papers [10, 11, 12]. The B3LYP
functional has proved to be a reliable tool for studying the structure and properties
of small metal clusters. It provides high accuracy at comparatively low computational
costs. For a discussion and a comparison with other approaches, see [13, 14]. Note that
the density of the parent cluster and two daughter fragments (including the overlapping
region before scission point) almost does not change during the ﬁssion process (by
analogy with the deformed jellium model, see [15, 16] for more details). This means
that the B3LYP method works adequately for any fragment separation distances, d,
during the ﬁssion process.

The calculations have been carried out with the use of the GAUSSIAN 98 software
package [17]. The 6-311G(d) and LANL2DZ basis sets of primitive Gaussian functions
have been used to expand the cluster orbitals [18]. The 6-311G(d) basis has been used
for simulations involving Na2+
10 cluster. This basis set takes into account electrons from
all atomic orbitals, so that the dynamics of all particles in the system is taken into
account. For Na2+
18 cluster we have used more numerically eﬃcient LANL2DZ basis, for
which valent atomic electrons move in an eﬀective core potential (see details in [18]).

To simulate the ﬁssion process we start from the optimized geometry of a cluster
(for details of the geometry optimization procedure see [13, 14]) and choose the atoms

4

the resulting fragments would consist of. The atoms chosen for a smaller fragment
are shifted from their locations in the parent cluster to a certain distance. Then, the
multidimensional potential energy surface, its gradient and forces with respect to the
molecular coordinates are calculated. These quantities specify the direction along the
surface in which the energy decreases the most rapidly and provide information for the
determination of the next step for the moving atoms. If the fragments are removed not
far enough from each other then the attractive forces prevailed over the repulsive ones
and the fragments stuck together forming the uniﬁed cluster again.
In the opposite
situation the repulsive forces dominate and the fragments drift away from each other.
The dependence of the total energy of the system on the fragment separation distance
forms the ﬁssion barrier. The aim of our simulations is to ﬁnd the ﬁssion pathway
corresponding to the minimum of the ﬁssion barrier.

There are usually many stable isomers of a cluster with energies slightly exceeding
the energy of the ground state isomer. In order to analyze the isomer dependence of the
ﬁssion barrier in the reaction Na2+
3 we have picked two energetically low-
lying isomers with the point symmetry groups C4v and D4d diﬀering from the distorted
Td point symmetry group of the ground state parent Na2+
10 cluster. Three isomer states
of the Na2+

10 cluster are shown in ﬁgure 1.

The barriers for all three channels are close. The weak sensitivity of the ﬁssion
barrier on the isomeric states of the reactants can be explained if one notices that the
barrier maxima are located at distances comparable to or exceeding the sum of the

resulting fragments radii, that is not far from the scission point. At such distances
is mainly
the interaction between the fragments, apart from Coulombic repulsion,
determined by the electronic properties rather than by the details of the ionic structure
of the fragments. This is an important argument for justiﬁcation of the jellium model
approach to the description of the ﬁssion process of multiply charged metal clusters.

It is important to note that the barriers presented in ﬁgure 2 are calculated in
assumption that ﬁssion occurs for the ﬁxed (given) isomers. However, since C4v and
D4d isomers are not the lowest energy states of Na2+
10 system, there could be other
processes competing with ﬁssion. One of such processes is rearrangement of the cluster
structure.

Rearrangement of the cluster structure during the ﬁssion process may signiﬁcantly
reduce the ﬁssion barrier. Such rearrangement may occur before the actual separation
of the daughter fragments begins or after that.
Fission of C4v and D4d isomers of Na2+

10 cluster is an example of situation where
rearrangement of the cluster structure takes place before the fragments start to separate.

two fragments of the parent cluster were not allowed to adjust their ionic structure
the ﬁssion barrier would be about 1 eV. Rearrangement of the cluster structure allows
to reduce the ﬁssion barrier down to 0.31 eV. During the ﬁssion process the daughter
fragments start to drift away from each other and a ”neck” forms between the fragments.
Formation of the ”neck” results in a metastable transitional state. The geometry of this
state, as well as the geometry of the parent cluster are shown in ﬁgure 5.

In table 1 we have summarized our results for the ﬁssion barrier heights and
compared them with the results of other molecular dynamics simulations and with the
predictions of the jellium model.

We have investigated two aspects of charged metal cluster ﬁssion process:
dependence of the ﬁssion barrier on isomer state of the parent cluster and importance
of rearrangement of the cluster ionic structure during the ﬁssion process.

We found that for a consistent choice of the atoms removed from the cluster the
ﬁssion barrier for the reaction Na2+
7 +Na+
3 has a weak dependence on the initial
isomer structure of the parent cluster. This implies that the particular ionic structure
of the cluster is largely insigniﬁcant for the height of the ﬁssion barrier. This is an
important argument for justiﬁcation of the jellium model approach to the description

10 → Na+

8

of the ﬁssion process of multiply charged metal clusters.

We have shown importance of rearrangement of the cluster ionic structure during
the ﬁssion process. The ﬁssion reaction can go through transition to another isomer
state of the parent cluster. This transition can occur before actual separation of the
fragments begins and/or ”neck” between the separating fragments is formed. In any
case the resulting ﬁssion barrier can be signiﬁcantly lower compared to the one for the
direct ﬁssion path.

The low-energy structures of mixed Ar–Xe and Kr–Xe Lennard-Jones clusters are investigated
using a newly developed parallel Monte Carlo minimization algorithm with speciﬁc exchange moves
between particles or trajectories. Tests on the 13- and 19- atom clusters show a signiﬁcant improve-
ment over the conventional basin-hopping method, the average search length being reduced by more
than one order of magnitude. The method is applied to the more diﬃcult case of the 38-atom cluster,
for which the homogeneous clusters have a truncated octahedral shape. It is found that mixtures of
dissimilar elements (Ar–Xe) favor icosahedral geometries over octahedra due to the reduced strain
penalty. Conversely, octahedra are even more stable in Kr–Xe mixtures than in Kr38 or Xe38, and
they show a core-surface phase separation behavior. Finally, we correlate the relative stability of
cubic structures in these clusters to the glassforming character of the bulk mixtures.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Clusters of heterogeneous materials show a much richer
behavior than their homogeneous counterparts. In many
bulk compounds, doping can signiﬁcantly aﬀect some
global property, and alloying is a common way to tai-
lor a completely new kind of material. At the mesoscale
level, size is another complicating factor, giving rise to
further changes with respect to the macroscopic object.
To a large extent, most expectations of nanotechnology
have been put into the electronic and catalytic properties
of small atomic clusters. Therefore, it should not be sur-
prising that numerous theoretical studies of mixed clus-
ters were devoted to bimetallic clusters.
In particular,
there has been a signiﬁcant amount of work at the level
of sophisticated electronic structure calculations,1,2,3 but
these were often limited to small sizes due to the nu-
merical eﬀort involved. On a diﬀerent scale of chemical
complexity, many studies have been carried out using
explicit, empirical force ﬁelds4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 in order to
investigate the segregation properties of these clusters.

Among the features that determine whether binary
systems undergo mixing or phase separation, surface en-
ergies and interactions between unlike atoms are two
competitive and important factors. Under appropri-
ate conditions, the kinetics of formations can also be
crucial.13

In comparison, ﬁnite-size compounds made of rare-gas
atoms have received much less attention. Fortunately,
they can be quite safely described using simple pairwise
potentials such as Lennard-Jones (LJ). Hence they are
much more convenient to study in a broad size range,
not only for their structure but also their dynamics of
thermodynamics. It is known from previous studies that
the topography of the potential energy surfaces of ho-
mogeneous LJ clusters can be very peculiar, as for the
sizes 38 or 75.14 The multiple-funnel structure of these
energy landscapes makes it especially hard to locate the

most stable structures (global minima) or to simulate the
ﬁnite-temperature behavior of these clusters in an ergodic
way. The eﬀects of mixing diﬀerent rare-gas atoms on
cluster structure and thermodynamics have been stud-
ied for the speciﬁc size 13 by Frantz on the examples of
Ar–Kr mixtures15 as well as Ne–Ar mixtures.16 Fanour-
gakis et al. have recently also investigated these latter
compounds.17 A systematic work of Ar–Xe mixed clus-
ters of 13 and 19 atoms has been carried out by Munro
and coworkers,18 including some global optimization and
Monte Carlo simulations.

The main conclusion of these studies is that atomic
heterogeneity can be responsible for a drastic increase
in complexity of the energy landscapes of rare-gas clus-
ters. This complexity is manifested by numerous new
low-lying minima in competitive funnels, characterized
by the same overall geometrical arrangement but diﬀer-
ent permutations of unlike atoms. Following Jellinek and
Krissinel,4 we will refer to such isomers as “homotops.”
The presence of several homotops on a given energy land-
scape often induces solid-solid transitions, which can be
detected by some feature in the heat capacity.15,16,17,18,19
As shown by Munro et al.,18 the various funnels corre-
sponding to diﬀerent homotops of a same geometry are
separated by signiﬁcant energy barriers. This explains
the diﬃculty or even failure of simulation methods to
achieve ergodic sampling of these systems, albeit small.18
A similar situation is found in Lennard-Jones polymers,20
where a large number of isomers are based on the same
geometrical arrangement, diﬀering only in the path link-
ing the monomers.

Beyond the actual rare-gases, binary Lennard-Jones
compounds have been investigated in both the cluster
and bulk regimes. Clarke and coworkers looked at phase
separation of small particles with equal compositions.21
Based on Monte Carlo simulations, they sketched a
phase diagram in the general structure of liquid clus-
ters. Bulk binary Lennard-Jones systems have been seen
to provide relatively simple numerical models for glass

formation.22,23,24,25,26,27 Most often, the LJ interactions
in such studies have been tuned in a non-additive way in
order to hinder crystallisation. In another related work,
Lee and coworkers28 have investigated the role of atomic
size ratio in binary and ternary metallic alloys.

Interestingly, severaly links between the physics and
chemistry of clusters and those of supercooled liquids
and glasses have been established since the pioneering
work by Frank.29 The initial suggestion that the local or-
der in simple liquids is not crystalline but icosahedral29
(more generally polytetrahedral) has since been veri-
ﬁed experimentally30 and theoretically.22,31 From the
clusters viewpoint, the favored ﬁnite-size structures of
good model glassformers have been shown by Doye and
coworkers to be polytetrahedral.32

The 38-atom homogeneous Lennard-Jones cluster is
known to show some glassy properties, especially slow
relaxation to the ground state,33 due to the competi-
tion between two stable funnels on the energy landscape,
corresponding to truncated octahedral and icosahedral
shapes, respectively. Due to entropic eﬀects,33,34 a solid-
solid transition occurs between the two funnels, at tem-
peratures lower than the melting point. The crystal-like
conﬁguration of this cluster makes it a good candidate to
further investigate the relationship between cluster struc-
ture and criteria for glassiﬁcation.

Because homogeneous LJ38 constitutes a relatively dif-
ﬁcult task for global optimization algorithms, binary
clusters of the same size can be expected to be much
worse. In this paper, we propose a simple but eﬃcient
way to deal with the multiple new minima introduced by
unlike atoms within a general Monte Carlo global mini-
mization scheme. This algorithm will then be applied to
the 38-atom case, in mixtures of Xe with either Ar or Kr
atoms. In the next section, we present the method and
test it on the simple cases of the 13- and 19-atom clusters.
In Sec. III we give our results obtained at size 38 and we
correlate them to the diﬀerent glassforming abilities of
the bulk mixtures. We ﬁnally conclude in Sec. IV.

II. METHODS

Global optimization of cluster structure35 is cur-
rently best achieved using either genetic algorithms36 or
the Monte Carlo+minimization method,37 also known
as basin-hopping (BH).38 The case of homogeneous
Lennard-Jones clusters is among the most documented
of cluster physics, and an up-to-date table of putative
global minima can be found in Ref. 39. Even though
it can never be guaranteed that global minimization has
been successful, it is likely that all important structural
forms of LJ clusters have been found up to more than 100
atoms. These include icosahedral, truncated octahedral,
decahedral as well as tetrahedral arrangements.

Compared to homogeneous clusters, the available data
on heterogeneous systems is rather scarce. Besides the
speciﬁc works by Frantz on the 13-atom Ne–Ar and Kr–

2

Ar clusters,15,16 Munro et al. used a parallel version of
the BH scheme, similar to the replica-exchange Monte
Carlo method,40 where several trajectories are run simul-
taneously at various temperatures.18 Although these au-
thors looked at moderately large clusters, they reported
signiﬁcant diﬃculties to locate global minima at speciﬁc
compositions, as in Xe10Ar3 or Xe13Ar6, for instance.18
A natural problem occuring using the basin-hopping
method is that many of the low-lying minima are ex-
pected to be related to each other via particle exchange.
Such a process only occurs via large deformations of
the remaining cluster, hence it is quite unprobable. As
in condensed matter physics,41,42,43 allowing exchange
moves between particles as a possible Monte Carlo step
may result in notably faster convergence, provided that
the interactions are not too dissimilar.

In the framework of global optimization methods, the
local minimization stage removes the possible energetic
penalty associated to replacing a small atom by a bigger
one. We can thus expect some increased eﬃciency of the
algorithm in case of multiple homotops. Other improve-
ments are possible. Since the tetrahedral isomer of LJ98
was discovered using a variant of the BH method,44 it has
been shown that temperature is not a key parameter of
this algorithm, and that it can be set to zero without loss
in eﬃciency. The extra numerical cost of running paral-
lel trajectories at various temperatures can thus be con-
verted into running them at various compositions. For a
XpYn−p compound, each of the n trajectories is then la-
belled with the number p of X atoms, running from 0 to p.
Exchange moves between adjacent trajectories (from p to
p + 1) thus need to incorporate the transmutation of two
atoms (one for each conﬁguration) into the other atom
type to preserve composition. As in most Monte Carlo
processes, the probability of attempting such moves must
be set in advance as a parameter.

The global optimization algorithm can thus be summa-
rized into its main steps. Keeping the above notations
for atom types, and denoting R(p)
the conﬁguration at
step i of trajectory p, we start the optimization process
using fully random conﬁgurations, but locally optimized.

i

1. With probability Pex, it is decided whether an ex-
change between adjacent trajectories will be at-
tempted or not.
If so, then the two trajectories
involved in the exchange are determined randomly.

2. For each composition p not concerned by any ex-
change, a new conﬁguration R(p)
i+1 is generated from
R(p)
i using either several particle exchanges or large
atomic moves. The probability to select particle ex-
changes is denoted Pswap, and the number of simul-
taneous exchanges is allowed to ﬂuctuate randomly
between 1 and N max
swap. If atomic moves are selected,
then each atom is displaced randomly around its
previous location in the three directions by a ran-
dom amount of maximum magnitude h(p). In both
cases, R(p)

i+1 is obtained after local minimization.

3. In case of an exchange between adjacent trajecto-
ries, the two conﬁgurations R(p)
cor-
responding to these trajectories are then swapped,
one X atom of R(p)
being transmuted into Y, and
one Y atom of R(p+1)
being transmuted into X.
Again, the conﬁgurations R(p)
are ob-
tained after local minimization.

4. As a zero temperature process, each new conﬁg-
uration is kept only if its energy is lower than the
energy at the previous step. Otherwise it is rejected
and replaced by the previous conﬁguration.

The algorithm has two main parameters, namely Pex
and Pswap. The maximum number of particle exchange
moves, N max
swap, was set to 4 in this study. We expect
that better results could be obtained by adjusting this
parameter appropriately, probably taking higher values
for larger clusters or for compostitions close to 50%. The
amplitude of atomic displacement, h(p), is set to half the
equilibrium distance in the X2 dimer for p = 0, half the
equilibrium distance in the Y2 dimer for p = n, and is
interpolated linearly between these two values for 0 <
p < n. In the present work, the exchange probabilities
were taken as Pex = 0.5 and Pswap = 0.9, hence allowing
a rather large probability of sampling among homotops
of a same structure.

Low-energy structures for mixtures of xenon with ei-
ther argon or krypton atoms have been ﬁrst investigated
for the sizes n = 13 and n = 19, as there are quantita-
tive global optimization data available for Ar–Xe clusters
from the Jordan group.18 It turns out that the energies
of the structures given in Ref. 18 do not exactly match
the values of the Lennard-Jones parameters used in this
study, probably due to a possible round-oﬀ of these pa-
rameters. We have adjusted the values of Leitner et al.45
to reproduce the clusters energies found by Munro and
coworkers.18. With respect to argon, the present data
for σ and ε are thus σKrKr = 1.12403, σXeXe = 1.206,
σKrXe = 1.16397, σArXe = 1.074, εKrKr = 1.373534,
εXeXe = 1.852, εKrXe = 1.59914, and εArXe = 1.48.
Global optimization of Ar–Xe and Kr–Xe clusters was
performed using the parallel algorithm previously de-
scribed, simultaneously for all compositions, for a maxi-
mum number of 10000 minimization steps per trajectory.
Ten independent runs were carried out to estimate an av-
erage search length for each composition. All global min-
ima reported by Munro et al. were always found within
the number of MC steps allowed.

The results for ArnXe13−n and KrnXe13−n clusters are
given in Table I. The average search length is generally
higher for compositions close to 50%, for which the num-
ber of homotops is maximum for a given isomer, regard-
less of symmetry. The statistics presently obtained for
Ar–Xe clusters show that the average search is between
10 and 1000 times faster than using conventional paral-
lel basin-hopping.18 Kr–Xe clusters roughly exhibit the
same level of diﬃculty, but we do not see any strong ev-

3

idence for particularly severe cases: Ar3Xe10 even seems
to be one of the easiest.

Similarly, the results obtained for ArnXe19−n clusters
show a signiﬁcant improvement over ﬁxed-composition
basin-hopping.18 They are given in Table II along with
the corresponding data for KrnXe19−n clusters. This
time, the algorithm is about 1–100 times faster depending
on n, the average search length being still longer for equal
compositions. For both the 13- and 19-atom clusters, all
global minima are homotops of either the single or dou-
ble icosahedron. This situation is particularly suited for
our algorithm, especially the exchange moves.

Initially, the conﬁgurations at all compositions are ran-
dom. The chances to locate the proper structure (with-
out any consideration of the homotops) increase linearly
with the number of trajectories. As soon as the right
structure is found, the algorithm naturally optimizes
atom types to ﬁnd the most stable homotop, hence the
global minimum. But it can also communicate the struc-
ture to the adjacent trajectories, until all compositions
only need to sample among the permutational homotops.
When the interactions are not too dissimilar (as in Kr–
Xe clusters), it is likely that the mixed clusters share the
same isomer as the global minimum of the homogeneous
cluster. The problem is then reduced to locating the most
stable homotops. By setting Pswap to one and starting
all trajectories from this minimum, the algorithm can
be even more successful, and we estimated the average
search length to be further reduced by a factor about 3
with respect to the values given in Table II. This version
of the algorithm was applied to the 55-atom Ar–Xe clus-
ters at all possible compositions, the results will be made
available as supplementary material.46 [see Table IV]

However, when the interactions diﬀer signiﬁcantly
among atoms types, or when the energy landscape of
the homogeneous cluster does not display a single steep
funnel, it becomes much harder to make a guess about
structure in these binary clusters.

III. APPLICATION TO THE 38-ATOM
CLUSTER

The LJ38 cluster is characterized by its archetypal two-
funnel energy landscape.33 The high free-energy barrier
separating these two funnels and the higher entropy of
the less stable minima of the icosahedral funnel make
it particularly hard to locate the truncated octahedral
lowest-energy minimum using unbiased global optimiza-
tion algorithms. Hence it is not surprising that this pe-
culiar structure was ﬁrst found by construction.48,49

A. Composition-induced transitions

of the huge number of homotops at this size, and most
importantly because of the structural competition be-
tween icosahedra and truncated octahedra, we cannot
be fully conﬁdent that the global optimization was suc-
cessful. Therefore, the energies reported in Table III for

Ar–Xe clusters should taken with caution, as they could
probably be bettered. The same data for 38-atom Kr–
Xe clusters is also available as supplementary material.46

ing the optimization process were categorized as either
icosahedral or cubic-like, depending on the energy of the
corresponding homogeneous isomer found by quenching.
In cases where the cubic isomer was not found among the
isomers, we performed additional optimizations starting
from this structure, setting Pswap to one. This mainly
occured for Ar–Xe clusters. Eventually, two series of
minima were obtained for each of the icosahedral and
octahedral funnels. We did not ﬁnd any decahedral iso-
mer that could compete with these structural types, even
though some evidence for stabilizing decahedra by doping
was reported in Ref. 50.

We have represented in Fig. 1 the relative energy dif-
ferences ∆E = Efcc − Eico between the most stable icosa-
hedral isomers and the most stable cubic isomers, as they
were obtained from our optimization scheme, for both the
Ar–Xe and Kr–Xe mixtures. Besides some strong varia-
tions sometimes seen from one composition to the next,
and which can be attributed to usual ﬁnite-size eﬀects,
general trends can be clearly observed.

First, Kr38−nXen clusters are always most stable in the
cubic shape. Actually, changing the composition most
often further stabilizes truncated octahedra, and only
rarely enhances the stability of icosahedra, which occurs
for n > 29 and n = 21. Conversely Ar38−nXen clus-
ters are preferentially found icosahedral, exceptions being
n > 35 and n = 0. This is an example of a composition-
induced structural transition between the two funnels of
the energy landscape.

From a computational point of view, it should be noted

that the optimization algorithm was able to locate the
truncated octahedral minima for Kr–Xe clusters by it-
self, starting from disordered minima, and that the extra
runs starting from this structure only produced slightly
more stable homotops. This is another illustration of the
eﬃciency of the present parallel optimization method.

tition between maximizing the number of nearest neigh-
bors and minimizing the strain energy, or penalty in-
duced by distorting these bonds.49 Binary Lennard-Jones
systems exhibit several extra complications due to the
various ways of rearranging atom types in a given struc-
ture. In these systems, the strain varies notably among
the homotops, especially in clusters made of very unlike
atoms. However, our results indicate that the same gen-
eral rules hold for homogeneous and heterogeneous sys-
tems. In Ar19Xe19, the strain is rather high, but the num-
ber of contacts is also high. In Kr19Xe19, both the strain
and the number of nearest neighbors are much smaller.
To investigate the role of heterogeneity on the strain,
we have computed the various contributions to the re-
duced strain energies in Ar38−nXen clusters. The strain
energies are deﬁned for Ar–Ar, Xe–Xe, and Ar–Xe inter-
actions as follows:49

In these equations, V LJ
X−Y is the total binding energy be-
tween atoms X and Y , N nn
X−Y is the number of X–Y
nearest neighbours, and εX−Y is the Lennard-Jones well
depth corresponding to the interaction between X and
Y atoms. Reduced strain energies are then deﬁned as
estrain = Estrain/N nnε, in order to account for the dif-
ferent magnitudes of the interactions among atom types.
The strain energies in Ar38−nXen clusters are represented
versus composition in Fig. 3. They give us some insight
about the possible ways of reducing strain.

FIG. 3: Reduced strain energies for alike and unlike interac-
tions in Ar38−nXen clusters, versus composition n.

The pattern exhibited by the reduced strain versus
composition exhibits diﬀerent behaviors for clusters hav-
ing mostly argon or xenon atoms. For n < 20, most

The general degree of disorder is higher in icosahedral
structures than in the cubic-like isomer. Hence it is more
diﬃcult to put up the latter geometry with very unlike
interactions, as in Ar–Xe clusters. Cubic homotops of
argon with xenon are rather distorted, but the strain is
much lower with krypton instead of argon. Examples of
global minima obtained at compositions n = 9, 19, and
29 are represented in Fig. 2.
In Kr–Xe compounds, a
progressive core-surface phase separation is seen with Kr
atoms outside, in agreement with energetic arguments.
In general, no complete phase separation is found in the
Ar–Xe clusters, even though Ar atoms seem to ﬁt best at
the centre of the cluster. In both cases, surface energies
thus play an important role. Mixing in these clusters can
be estimated using radial distribution functions.47 Here
we use the same index as Jellinek and Krissinel,4 namely
the overall mixing ratio γ deﬁned as4

γ(XpYn−p) =

EXpYn−p − EXp (XpXn−p) − EYn−p(YpYn−p)
EXpYn−p

,

(1)
where EXpYn−p is the binding energy of cluster XpYn−p,
EXp (XpXn−p) the binding energy of subcluster Xp in the
homogeneous cluster XpXn−p at the same atomic conﬁg-
uration as XpYn−p, and a similar deﬁnition for the last
term of Eq. (1). As seen from Table III, the mixing ratio
increases notably in Ar–Xe clusters, up to more than 60%
for some compositions. Kr–Xe clusters, despite exhibit-
ing some core-surface segregation, show similar variations
of the mixing ratio with composition, with only slightly
smaller values of γ. Therefore the mixing ratio, as de-
ﬁned in Eq. (1), is a rather ambiguous parameter for
quantifying the extent of mixing in this small cluster.

The optimal structure of an homogeneous cluster de-
scribed with a pairwise potential results from a compe-

strain is carried by interactions between alike atoms.
This case is illustrated by Ar9Xe29 in Fig. 2, where a
kind of core/surface phase separation occurs. Here sur-
face energies are crucial. Above this size, the reverse situ-
ations takes place, and interactions between unlike atoms
are signiﬁcantly more strained. The case of Ar29Xe9 de-
picted in Fig. 2 is perticularly informative: Xe atoms are
located scarcely among the icosahedral cluster, and re-
lieve the structure from too much strain at the expense of
only few Xe–Xe interactions. In this case, cluster struc-
ture is driven by the number of unlike interactions.

It is also worth noting that a few compositions are
especially weakly strained; this occurs when the global
minimum is octahedral, but also in the range 19 < n <
24. For these latter clusters, the core/surface segregation
and the number of unlike interactions are both optimal.

B. Temperature-induced transitions

The extremely large number of isomers (including ho-
motops) in the energy landscape of binary Lennard-Jones
clusters, added to the expected presence of signiﬁcant
energy barriers between icosahedral and cubic isomers,33
prevent ﬁnite-temperature simulations from being con-
ducted in a reliably ergodic way with the presently avail-
able tools. For example, the particle exchange moves
used to accelerate convergence of sampling among ho-
motops will likely have very low acceptance probabili-
ties in MC simulations at low temperatures, especially
for Ar–Xe clusters. Therefore, even with powerful meth-
ods such as parallel tempering or multicanonical Monte
Carlo, reaching convergence in 38-atom LJ clusters does
not seem currently feasible to us.

As an alternative, we have chosen to investigate
solid-solid transitions by means of the superposition
approach.51,52 For a given cluster, databases of minima in
each of the icosahedral (ICO) and truncated octahedral
(FCC) funnels were constructed using the optimization
algorithm. For each composition and each of the two fun-
nels, no more than 2000 distinct minima were considered.
The classical partition function of the Y38−pXep cluster
(Y=Ar or Kr) restricted to funnel A=FCC or ICO is ap-
proximated by a harmonic superposition over all minima
of the databases, which belong to this funnel:52

QA(β) = X
i∈A

ni

exp(−βEi)
(βh¯νi)3n−6 ,

(2)

where β = 1/kBT is the inverse temperature, ¯νi the ge-
ometric mean vibrational frequency, ni = 2p!(n − p)!/hi
with hi the order of the point group of minimum i and
n = 38. We do not consider quantum eﬀects here, al-
though they may be important at low temperatures,53
since delocalization or zero-point eﬀects are not expected
to be signiﬁcant for rare gases as heavy as krypton or
xenon.

Within the harmonic superposition approximation, a
solid-solid transition occurs when QFCC = QICO.54 This

7

latter equation is solved numerically in β or T , its so-
lution is denoted Tss.
In cases where icosahedra are
energetically more stable than octahedra, a solid-solid
transition can occur if some cubic structures are entrop-
ically favored, which requires lower vibrational frequen-
cies and/or lower symmetries. We did not ﬁnd such sit-
uations in our samples of Ar–Xe clusters, therefore we
restrict to Kr–Xe clusters in the following.

Similar to transitions between funnels, transitions be-
tween homotops will happen if their partition functions
are equal. The huge number of homotops gives rise to as
many values for the corresponding temperatures, and we
deﬁne the homotop transition temperature Th such that

Th = min

j

{T (j)

h | T (j)

h > 0},

(3)

h

where T (j)
is the transition temperature between the
global minimum (homotop 0) and its homotop j. Equat-
ing the harmonic partition functions for these two isomers
leads to the expression of T (j)

h :54

kBT (j)

h =

Ej − E0
(3n − 6) ln ¯ν0/¯νj + ln nj/n0

.

(4)

Since all homotops are characterized by diﬀerent vibra-
tional and symmetry properties, the transition temper-
atures T (j)
are not ordered exactly as the energy diﬀer-
h
ences Ej −E0. This reﬂects that solid-solid transitions in-
volve crossover in free energy rather than binding energy.
The above equation also shows that T (j)
can take nega-
tive values if homotop j has a higher symmetry and/or
a higher vibrational frequency than the ground state. In
this case the global minimum is always the free energy
minimum, and no solid-solid transition occurs, hence the
form of Eq. (3).

Finally, a third temperature has a strong consequence
on cluster structure, namely the melting temperature.
Its estimation from either simulations or superpositions
approximations is already quite diﬃcult for the homoge-
neous LJ38 cluster,33,34 and we did not attempt to com-
pute it for binary clusters. However, the previous study
by Frantz15 has shown that the melting point in mixed,
13-atom Ar–Kr clusters varies quite regularly (approxi-
mately quadratically) with composition. We have used
an even simpler rule here, by assuming that the melting
point of Kr38−nXen, Tmelt(n), is related linearly to the
melting points Tmelt(0) and Tmelt(38) of Kr38 and Xe38,
respectively. From the results obtained by Doye and
Wales33 and the Monte Carlo data of Ref. 34 for the LJ38
cluster, we get Tmelt(0) ≃ 0.234 and Tmelt(38) ≃ 0.315 in
reduced LJ units of argon. This linear approximation
obviously neglects ﬁnite-size eﬀects, but will provide a
rough estimation.

The transition temperatures are represented in Fig. 4
for all compositions in Kr38−nXen clusters. We no-
tice ﬁrst that the structural transition temperature Tss
varies quite regularly with composition in both the ranges
n < 19 and n > 21, and that it shows strong size eﬀects

between these limits. Several situations are predicted to
occur depending on the relative values of Tss, Th and
Tmelt.

In most cases, Tmelt < Tss. That melting takes place at
temperatures lower than the cubic/icosahedral transition
simply nulliﬁes the transition between structural types.
However, this extra stability of the octahedral funnel may
have a consequence on the melting point itself, which is
likely to increase. Still, this situation implies that simu-
lations will more easily reach convergence.

However, there are notable exceptions for this behav-
ior, at n < 4, n = 21 and n > 34.
In these clusters,
heterogeneity is not suﬃcient for the thermodynamical
behavior of the cluster to deviate too much from those of
the homogeneous system.

The transition between homotops usually occurs prior
to melting. Thermal equilibrium within the cubic funnels
thus involve several homotops (and “restricted” solid-
solid transitions), and the corresponding thermodynam-
ical state could be probably simulated using speciﬁcally
designed exchange moves between outer particles within
a Monte Carlo scheme.

A few clusters melt before exhibiting any transition
between homotops. This occurs for instance at n = 11, 13
or 15. For these sizes the structural transition also occurs
at temperatures higher than the estimated melting point.
These cases should pose less problems to conventional
simulations than the homogeneous cluster.

C. Glassy behavior

8

The previous results have shown that ﬁnite-size Ar–Xe
compounds show a preferential icosahedral order, even
for very low doping rates, over octahedral order. The re-
verse seems to hold for Kr–Xe clusters at the same size.
Since icosahedral order is known to be present in liq-
uids and, more generally, in disordered structural glasses,
it seems natural to correlate the behavior observed in
these clusters to the dynamics of the corresponding bulk
materials.22

We have simulated the cooling of 108-atom binary
rare-gas liquids, using a simple Metropolis Monte Carlo
scheme under constant volume and temperature.
Ini-
tially the atoms are placed randomly into a cubic box of
side L, and periodic bondaries are treated in the min-
imum image convention. The LJ interactions were not
truncated, and the simulations consisted of 100 stages of
105 MC cycles each, linearly spaced in temperature.

Three compositions have been selected, following our
knowledge of the cluster structure. For each composition,
diﬀerent length sizes L and diﬀerent temperature ranges
[Tmin, Tmax] were chosen in order to cover both sides of
the melting point. In the ﬁrst mixture, 24 xenon atoms
and 84 argon atoms are simulated with L = 4.8815 LJ
units of argon, with 0.1 ≤ T ≤ 1. In the second mix-
ture, 24 xenon atoms are added to 84 krypton atoms at
L = 5.487 and 0.15 ≤ T ≤ 1.5. The third mixture con-
sists of 9 argon atoms and 99 xenon atoms at L = 5.887
and 0.2 ≤ T ≤ 2. Even though we did not attempt to
locate the most stable crystalline forms for these mix-
tures, our searches close to the face-centred cubic mor-
phology showed that the most stable conﬁgurations for
these mixtures always had some cubic order. It is likely
that the actual ground states for such systems are indeed
crystalline.55

The average root mean square ﬂuctuation of the bond
distances, also known as the Lindemann index δ, uni-
versally characterizes the thermodynamical state of the
condensed system as either solid or liquid, depending
on its value being lower or higher than about 0.15. To
quantify the extent of crystalline order, we have used the
bond order parameter Q4 introduced by Steinhardt and
coworkers.56 The two parameters δ and Q4 allow us to
follow in Monte Carlo time the cooling processes for all
materials in a simultaneous way, independently of ther-
modynamical characteristics such as the melting temper-
ature.

The correlation between δ and Q4 for ten cooling sim-
ulations of each of the three bulk binary compounds is
represented in Fig. 5. In all cases, the Lindemann param-
eter covers the whole range 0.01 < δ < 0.18, indicating
that the melting point was indeed crossed. However, the
three compounds display very contrasted cooling behav-
iors.

In the (Ar84Xe24) system, δ regularly decreases but
Q4 always remain below 0.05. Therefore crystallization
never takes place, and the ﬁnal state obtained by quench-

ing is signiﬁcantly higher in energy than some crystalline
forms; this is typical of glass formation.

In (Kr84Xe24), all simulations show some rather sharp
transition from a (high δ, low Q4) state to a (low δ,
high Q4) state as δ crosses about 0.1. The temperatures
where crystallisation occurs may vary somewhat among
the cooling runs, in the same way as they are expected
to depend on the cooling rate.

Lastly, the case of (Ar9Xe99) is intermediate: while
most simulations end up in a nearly fully crystalline
phase (Q4 ∼ 0.15), a few of them show a limited degree
of cubic ordering in the solid phase, Q4 having values
close to 0.07.

These results very closely reﬂect our previous data on
binary, 38-atom clusters of the same materials. In terms
of composition, the ﬁrst mixture corresponds to Ar30Xe8,
which clearly favors icosahedral shapes over truncated
octahedra. The second mixture reminds of Kr30Xe8, for
which the cubic structure is even more stable than in
the homogeneous cluster. The third mixture should be
compared to Ar3Xe35, which favors icosahedra only mod-
erately.

This correlation found here between cluster structure
and the glassforming ability of the bulk material con-
ﬁrms previous analyses on the icosahedral local order in
liquids and glasses,22,31 as well as the recent conclusions
obtained by Doye et al.32 that clusters of good glassform-
ers indeed show a polytetrahedral order.

IV. CONCLUSION

As far as structural and dynamical properties are con-
cerned, binary compounds show a signiﬁcantly richer
complexity with respect to homogeneous clusters. The

9

work reported in the present paper was intended to
achieve several goals. First, a parallel global optimiza-
tion algorithm was designed to locate the most stable
structures of mixed rare-gas clusters. Based on the basin-
hopping or Monte Carlo+minimization algorithm,37,38
this algorithm includes exchange moves between parti-
cles at ﬁxed composition as well as exchange moves be-
tween conﬁgurations at diﬀerent compositions. Tests on
simple ArnXe13−n and ArnXe19−n clusters show that the
method is quite eﬃcient, in addition to being easy to im-
plement.

Putative global minima for Ar38−nXen and Kr38−nXen
clusters have been investigated for all compositions. The
structure of Ar–Xe compounds is mainly icosahedral, ex-
cept at very low doping rates. Kr–Xe clusters not only
remain as truncated octahedra, but mixing the two rare
gases even favors these cubic structures over icosahedra.
We see some signiﬁcant trend toward core/surface phase
separation in Ar–Xe clusters with n > 20 and in all Kr–
Xe clusters. Conversely, Ar38−nXen clusters with n < 20
exhibit a higher degree of mixing. Analysing the strain in
these stable structures conﬁrms the presence of a struc-
tural transition near n = 20 in these systems.

Within the harmonic superposition approximation, we
have estimated the temperatures required by the 38-atom
Kr–Xe clusters to undergo a structural transition toward
the icosahedral funnel, or toward other octahedral homo-
tops. For compositions with a doping rate higher than
3/38, the structural transition temperature was seen to
occur at temperatures higher than the extrapolated melt-
ing point. This mainly reﬂects the special stability of the
octahedral structures, and has the probable consequence
that actual melting points increase somewhat. These pre-
dictions could probably be checked with numerical simu-
lations. For most compositions, the transitions between
diﬀerent homotops of the truncated octahedron are seen
to be potentially induced by relatively small tempera-
tures. Therefore particle exchange moves will be neces-
sary in order that simulations remain close to ergodic.

Finally, and following previous

results by other
researchers,22,31,32 we have found some further evidence
that criteria for glass formation in bulk materials may
also lie in the parameters, which are responsible for sta-
ble cluster structures. Since the atomistic simulation of
the dynamical vitriﬁcation process can generally be much
harder than obtaining stable conﬁgurations of atomic
clusters, we expect the approach followed in the present
theoretical eﬀort to be also useful in the community of
glasses and supercooled liquids.

The method is obviously not limited to rare-gases, and
its application to other compounds, especially metallic
nanoalloys, is straightforward. From a methodological
point of view, it could also be applied to materials with
more than two components. Work on ternary systems is
currently in progress.

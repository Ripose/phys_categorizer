ABSTRACT

The random-phase-approximation (RPA) method with separable residual forces
(SRPA) is proposed for the description of multipole electric oscillations of valence
electrons in deformed alkali metal clusters. Both the deformed mean ﬁeld and
residual interaction are derived self-consistently from the Kohn-Sham functional.
SRPA drastically simpliﬁes the computational eﬀort which is urgent if not deci-
sive for deformed systems. The method is applied to the description of dipole,
quadrupole and octupole plasmons in deformed sodium clusters of a moderate
size. We demonstrate that, in clusters with the size N > 50, Landau damping
successfully competes with deformation splitting and even becomes decisive in
forming the width and gross structure of the dipole plasmon. Besides, the plas-
mon is generated by excitations from both ground state and shape isomers. In
such clusters familiar experimental estimates for deformation splitting of dipole
plasmon are useless.

1 Introduction

Most of free atomic clusters are known to exhibit quadrupole, hexadecapole,
octupole, etc. deformations (see, e.g., [1]-[11] and references therein). The defor-
mations persist from lightest [5, 11] to heavy[7] clusters and considerably inﬂu-
ence cluster’s static and dynamical properties. For example, the axial (triaxial)
quadrupole deformation leads to the splitting of the dipole plasmon into two
(three) peaks [2, 9, 10] and to speciﬁc low-energy orbital magnetic dipole reso-
nance [12]-[14].

Investigation of deformation eﬀects in the dynamics of clusters is a topic of
current interest, for reviews and monographs see [15]-[21]. At the same time, the
handling of excitations in deformed clusters is much more tedious because there
are less selection rules and thus larger irreducible particle-hole spaces. In particu-
lar, random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculations for multipole oscillations of
the valence electrons (plasmons) require diagonalization of matrices with a very
high rank (up to 105 and more).

For this reason, the calculations are mainly limited either to light clusters
(with number of atoms N < 20) where the computational eﬀort is still acceptable
[11], or to very heavy clusters where one may neglect eﬀects of quantum shells and
use macroscopic models, thus avoiding a deal with a huge conﬁguration space.
The main computational troubles are concentrated in the intermediate size region,
10 < N < 103, where sizable eﬀects of quantum shells take place. Here there exits
only few calculations with RPA or fully ﬂedged Time-Dependent Local Density
Approximation (TDLDA) (see, for example, [22]-[24]). Thus one often chooses
simpliﬁed methods, like Sum-Rule Approach (SRA) (see, e.g., [25]) or local RPA
(LRPA) [26, 27]. They allow to reproduce the energy and gross structure of the
plasmon, but cannot properly describe such important feature of cluster dynamics
as Landau damping. At the same time, it is just Landau damping which greatly
inﬂuences the shape of the plasmon and provides the dominant contribution to
its width in medium and heavy clusters [27]-[29]. So, there is the need in RPA
approach for deformed clusters, which, on the one hand, gives comprehensive and
accurate description of multipole plasmons, including Landau damping eﬀects,
and, on the other hand, accomplishes this in economical way.

To this end, a new kind of RPA method has been recently proposed [28, 30].
It invokes a self-consistent expansion of the residual two-body interaction ˆVres
into a sum of separable terms:

Here, κkk′ is the matrix of strength constants,
is the particle-hole ma-
trix element of the local one-body operator ˆQk(r). The expansion index k labels
various angular momentum channels λµ as well as a series of diﬀerent radial func-
tions within each channel. The method proposed is called as a ”separable RPA”
or SRPA. Due to the separable ansatz, SRPA has the advantage to transform the

high-rank RPA matrix to a simple dispersion equation, which drastically reduces
the computational eﬀort. This is crucial for studies of the linear response in de-
formed or large spherical systems, when one has to deal with a huge particle-hole
conﬁguration space.

It should be emphasized that SRPA has important distinctions as compared
with trivial separable RPA schemes widely used in many-body studies, especially
in nuclear theory [31, 32]. Such schemes exploit only one separable term with
an intuitive guess for the separable one-body operator ˆQ(r), and the strength
constant κ is ﬁtted as to reproduce available experimental data. The present
SRPA constitutes a systematic expansion of the self-consistent residual interac-
tion. The analytical expressions for both strength matrix κkk′ and operators
ˆQk(r) are uniquely prescribed by the given ˆVres. There are thus no adjustable pa-
rameters. One can easily control the convergence of the expansion by comparing
calculations with diﬀerent cutoﬀs K. In fact, already a single SRPA separable
term provides a fair description of the gross structures, and a good handful of
terms allows to reproduce exact RPA calculations [28, 29]. The SRPA scheme
was also proven to cooperate with the more involved Hamiltonians containing
non-local pseudo-potentials [29].

The separable expansions [28] and [30] use diﬀerent self-consistent prescrip-
tions. The method [28] deals with simple ˆQk(r) operators but for the price of
more separable terms. Vice versa, the operators in [30] are more involved but
the method needs less number of separable terms. In the present paper, we will
deal with the method [30] where the form of the separable operators ˆQk(r) and
strength matrix κkk′ are determined from the Vibrating Potential Model (VPM)
[33]-[35]. The number of separable terms K is usually limited by 2-3 and 4-6 in
light and heavy clusters, respectively.

First SRPA results for the dipole plasmon and scissors mode in deformed
[13]-[15], [35]-[37]. But these calculations were
clusters were presented in refs.
based on a simple shell-model ground state using a deformed Woods-Saxon po-
tential where the deformations were not obtained within the same calculation
scheme but taken from other sources, both experimental and theoretical. In the
present paper, we present fully self-consistent SRPA scheme for deformed clus-
ters. Both, the deformed mean ﬁeld and residual interaction, are derived from
the same Kohn-Sham functional. Ground state deformations are optimized by
minimization of the total energy. SRPA is applied to detailed description of the
dipole, quadrupole and octupole plasmons in axially-deformed singly-charged Na
clusters of a diﬀerent size. Both quadrupole and hexadecapole deformations are
taken into account.

We will show that in light clusters the dipole plasmon exhibits distinctive
two-peak structure caused by the deformation splitting and just this splitting is
mainly responsible for the plasmon width. The ratio between the peaks allows to
conclude on either prolate or oblate shape takes place. The situation changes for
medium and heavy deformed clusters where Landau damping becomes the main
mechanism deﬁning the width and gross structure of the plasmon. Moreover,
such clusters exhibit a complicated energy surface with shape isomers which, in

spite of a tiny energy deﬁcit relative to the ground state, possess quite diﬀer-
ent deformation. Obviously, such isomers can contribute to the plasmon. Due
to both the factors, Landau damping and contributions of shape isomers, gross
structure of the dipole plasmon in medium and heavy deformed clusters cannot
already serve as a direct ﬁngerprint of the deformation and familiar experimen-
tal prescriptions for getting magnitude and kind (prolate or oblate) of cluster’s
quadrupole deformation become useless.

In Section 2, the deformed Kohn-Sham mean ﬁeld is described. The existence
of shape isomers in heavy clusters is demonstrated. SRPA equations are derived
and speciﬁed for deformed clusters.
In Sec. 3, SRPA results for the dipole
plasmon are discussed. The same is done for quadrupole and octupole plasmons.
The summary is given in Sec. 4. Appendixes A-C contain details of the formalism.

the density and kinetic energy density of valence electrons, expressed through the

and thus improves the convergence of numerical results.

respectively. These values allow to describe the energy of the dipole plasmon in
a wide size region ( see Ref. [29] and present results). Decrease of the diﬀuseness
parameter results in a redshift of the dipole plasmon which should follow lowering
the temperature. The recent experimental data for the dipole plasmon in light
and medium clusters [39] were obtained at T = 105 K. So, just this temperature
and the value α = 0.8 a.u. are used in the paper for all clusters except of the
heaviest one Na+
119. For the latter cluster the experimental data are absent and
so the common value α = 1.0 a.u. is used.

2.2 Representation of wave functions for stationary de-

formed states

Stationary states of the cluster are obtained as solution of the stationary Kohn-
Sham equations ˆh0(r)ψq(r) = εqψq(r) where ˆh0(r) is the single-particle Hamil-
tonian (8) in the static limit. We expand single-particle wave functions of the
deformed Kohn-Sham potential in the complete basis of eigenfunctions φs(r)

Making use the multipole expansion for static potentials (10)-(11) and densities

tions ψq are derived. As a ﬁrst step, the Kohn-Sham problem is solved in the
spherical limit and then the basis obtained is used for deformed Kohn-Sham po-

the parameters λF and C. The procedure is performed for every point in the

2.3 Results for stationary states of deformed clusters

We consider axially deformed clusters Na+
119. These
clusters cover diﬀerent size regions and represent both prolate and oblate shapes.
Following calculations [2]-[8], they do not exhibit neither triaxiality, nor octupole
deformation and, so, we may safely deal only with axial quadrupole and hexade-
capole deformations. The equilibrium values of δ2 and δ4 and the corresponding
moments are presented in Table I. The moments are deﬁned as

As we checked, the calculated moments are close to those obtained within the
Structure Averaged Jellium Model (SAJM) [3]. Table I shows that some clusters
exhibit considerable hexadecapole deformation. Further, in particular clusters the
values δ4 and β4 seem to be disentangled. For example, large δ4 corresponds to
small β4 in Na+
27. This reﬂects the fact that hexadecapole
moments are determined by both quadrupole and hexadecapole terms in (13)
and, moreover, the role of the quadrupole term is leading.

state deformations are characterized by a deep and distinctive minimum with
considerable energy gain as compared with shape isomers. The number of isomers
increases and their energy diﬀerence shrinks with increasing system size. The ﬁrst
isomers in Na+
119 are given in the Table I. They exhibit an opposite
sign of quadrupole deformations as compared to the ground state. Fig.1 shows,
as an example, the energy surface of Na+
119, which has three distinct minima. The
second isomer demonstrates a dominant hexadecapole deformation.
In Figs. 2 and 3, the single-particle spectra of prolate Na+

27 and oblate Na+

are shown and compared with the corresponding spectra in the spherical limit.
It is well visible how the deformation removes degeneracies. Note that prolate
and oblate clusters exhibit the opposite assignment of quantum numbers inside
subshells.

3 Separable approach to dynamics

3.1 Small amplitude dynamics
Up to now, we have determined stationary states with a mean ﬁeld ˆh0(r), den-
sity ρ0(r) and single-particle wave functions ψq(r). We are now proceeding the
dynamical Kohn-Sham equations

ˆh(r, t)ψq(r, t) = i

ψq(r, t) .

∂
∂t

(16)

The many-body wave functions are composed from the single-particle wave func-
tions ψq(r, t) as Slater determinants Ψ(r1, ..., rN , t). In the linear regime, when
only small oscillations about the stationary state are considered, one gets in ﬁrst
order perturbation

The δˆh(r, t) is a purely instantaneous and local operator by virtue of the local-

δˆh(r, t) = δˆh+(r)eiωt + δˆh−(r)e−iωt.

Further, for small-amplitude harmonic oscillations in the vicinity of the static

The rank of the SRPA matrix (26) is equal to the number K of the separable
operators, which, as is shown below, is typically 3-6. So the rank is dramatically
less than in the case of involved RPA methods. This results in drastic simpliﬁ-
cation of RPA calculations. At the same time, the total number of SRPA roots
equals to the number of particle-hole conﬁgurations and every SRPA state is a
superposition of these conﬁgurations. The SRPA keeps the important RPA fea-
ture to describe the Landau damping but gets this with much less computational
eﬀort.

3.3 Self-consistent prescription for separable operators
Up to now, the operators ˆQk(r) and strength matrix κkk′ were not still chosen.
Obviously, the success of SRPA depends on the choice. The better it is, the
smaller number of the separable operators we need to reproduce ˆVres. We are
considering systems with pronounced collective modes (the various plasmons in
case of clusters) and so just collective deformations should motivate the form of
ˆQk(r). Here we will follow the VPM prescription [34] which was very eﬀective in
the SRPA calculations for spherical clusters [29]. In the VPM, the operators ˆQk(r)
are self-consistently generated by collective variations of the density which in turn
is determined by the scaling transformation [34, 41]. Being thus constructed,
only few operators are enough to cover successfully the dynamics. Speciﬁcally,
the collective deformation is achieved by the scaling transformation

Here, the local operators fk(r) determine the intended time-even shape of the
deformation. For example, f = z leads to a translation along z-direction, f =
r2Y20 results in an ellipsoidal deformation. The collective amplitudes αk(t) =
˜αkcos ωt determine the relative weights of diﬀerent deformation modes. For small

these operators are identical with the basis operators to be used in the separable
ansatz (1). This amounts to identify the collective response (34) of operators
(35) with that from the separable ansatz (22), which ﬁnally yields the strengths

Eqs. (25)-(29), (31), and (35)-(37) constitute the complete set of self-consistent
SRPA equations. One has to point out that, like involved RPA, SRPA maintains
full details of 1ph structure in the spectra. The only point is that the residual
interaction is parametrized in terms of collective picture.

It is easy to see from (32) that just input local operators fk(r) determine the
character of the perturbation. The choice of the operators is the most delicate
point of the approach and devotes a special attention (see discussion in Appendix
C). We use the set of hermitian operators:

with

fλkpkµ(r) = rλk+pk(Yλkµ(Ω) + Y †

λkµ(Ω))

λkpk = 10, 12, 14, 30, 32 for (µ = 0, 1),
λkpk = 20, 22, 24, 40, 42 for (µ = 0, 1, 2),
λkpk = 30, 32, 34, 50, 52 for (µ = 0, 1, 2, 3)

for dipole, quadrupole and octupole excitations, respectively. It is seen that in
all the sets the ﬁrst operator has the form of the applied electric external ﬁeld
in the long-wave approximation, the others two represent a variety of the radial
dependencies to cover diﬀerent slices of the system and the last ones take into
account the coupling of diﬀerent λ-modes with equal µ and parity, which takes
place in deformed systems. Relative contributions of diﬀerent input operators
fλkpkµ(r) to the residual interaction are self-consistently regulated by the strict
computation of the strengths according to Eq. (37).

Plasmons in deformed clusters involve a lot of RPA states which in any case

one may rewrite (43) in the form independent of j (when the response is directly

Unlike expression for the standard strength function [31, 16], Eq. (50) consists
from two terms. The ﬁrst one is contribution from the residual interaction and
the second one is unperturbed strength function. This form is convenient for the

4 Results and discussion

4.1 Dipole plasmon

Results of SRPA calculations for the dipole plasmon are exhibited in Figs. 4-6.
Two diﬀerent presentations are used. First, to demonstrate the complex structure
of the plasmon and Landau damping, the photoabsorption strength (40) is given
for every RPA state by a vertical bar (in eV ˚A). Second, for the convenience of
the comparison with experimental data, the strength function (43) averaged with
the Lorentz weight is used. The value of the averaging parameter is ∆ = 0.25 eV
to simulate the typical thermal broadening of the plasmon.

15 and Na+

27 and oblate Na+

In Fig. 4, the photoabsorption is presented for three light deformed clusters,
prolate Na+
35. The SRPA calculations are compared
with recent experimental data [39] obtained at rather low temperature T = 105K.
The agreement with experiment is very satisfying. It should be mentioned that
the average energy of the plasmon was slightly corrected by decrease of the dif-
fuseness parameter α in (12) from 1.0 to 0.8 a0. The value 1.0 a0 chosen to
simulate ionic eﬀects at high temperatures (T = 400
800K) [27] is not suitable
for T = 105K. The decrease of the surface diﬀuseness α leads to a blueshift of
the plasmon, which is indeed seen when lowering the temperature. Beside the
good description of the average energy, the deformation splitting of the plasmon
into two peaks is well reproduced. The peaks correspond to µ = 0 and 1 dipole
modes. The latter involves contributions from both µ =
1 projections and so is
about twice as large. This mode forms the upper part of the plasmon spectrum
in prolate clusters and the lower part in oblate ones (see also Fig. 9 e)). The
splitting is well developed in the prolate clusters and less strong in the oblate
Na+
35. Though ﬁrst evidence of the Landau damping is already seen, the plas-

−

±

mon gross-structure and width are still mainly determined by the deformation
splitting.

Following such a splitting analysis, one is tempted to associate with Na+
53 (see
Fig. 5) an oblate deformation. Its plasmon shape is rather similar to the one for
oblate Na+
35 and the broad peak with a small right shoulder at 3.1 eV can, in
principle, be approximated by two Lorentz curves “justifying” an oblate shape,
as done e.g.
in [39]. However, our calculations show that this interpretation is
misleading. Unlike lighter clusters, Na+
53 shows considerable Landau damping
(see bars in Fig. 5, top panel). This broadens the plasmon and modiﬁes its gross-
structure. In particular, the structure at 3.1 eV is caused not by µ = 0 mode
but by the group of µ = 1-states. Our calculations predict for this cluster the
prolate shape, which results in very satisfactory agreement with the experimental
data. Good description is also obtained for other clusters in this size region
(see the comprehensive SRPA analysis of the data [39] in [43]). Our conclusion
on prolate shape of clusters in this size region agrees with calculations of other
groups [44]. Altogether this means, that generally accepted experimental practice
to treat plasmon shape within simple deformation models and thus to conclude on
cluster deformation is not appropriate for medium-size clusters. This way does
not take into account important role of Landau damping in forming plasmon
gross-structure and width and so can be misleading.

For medium and large clusters, the disentangling of the dipole spectrum be-
comes even more complicated because of possible incoherent contributions from
isomers. Table I shows that Na+
53 has oblate isomeric state with a tiny energy
deﬁcit as compared with the ground state. This isomer can also contribute to the
observed spectrum. The bottom panel of Fig. 5 demonstrates that the isomeric
state yields similar pattern, in spite of reverse ordering of µ = 0 and 1 modes. In
Na+
53 both the modes are broad and have two-peak structure. In some important
details the isomer plasmon deviates from the experimental data.

The picture is complicated with further growing cluster size. As was shown in
Fig.1, the energy surface in Na+
119 has already three distinctive minima: oblate
ground state, ﬁrst prolate isomer and second hexadecapole isomer. The corre-
sponding plasmons are exhibited in Fig. 6. Contributions of µ = 0 and 1 modes
are also given to show the role of the deformation. All the plasmons demonstrate
strong Landau damping which determines, in a large extent, their width. Just be-
cause of Landau damping, the plasmons, in spite of diﬀerent cluster deformations,
show very similar broad shapes. Obviously, all three deformation conﬁgurations
of Na+
119 can contribute to the measured spectrum. Indeed, clusters exhibit ther-
mal shape ﬂuctuations which are incoherently added in experiment. The shapes
of the ground state and ﬁrst isomers have to provide the dominant contribu-
tion. The observed plasmon reﬂects a statistical mix of many shapes with a few
dominants.

To summarize, the calculations demonstrate increasing importance of Landau
damping and isomer mixing for the dipole spectrum. Already at medium cluster
sizes these factors cannot be neglected. As a result, the often used prescription
to conclude on cluster shape on the grounds of approximation of plasmon shape

by 1-3 Lorentz curves is insuﬃcient for these system sizes.

The strong fragmentation of the spectra through Landau damping may raise
doubts on the collectivity of the plasmon oscillation. The strength is distributed
over many sub-states and calculations show that even the strongest RPA states
do not exceed more than 2-4 times the strength of particle-hole conﬁgurations, in
heavy clusters even less. Nevertheless, the entity of RPA states near the plasmon
frequency can still be called collective. One may view this as a two step process.
The dipole excitation ﬁrst generates a collective surface plasmon state which
is then quickly distributed over the nearby particle-hole states through Landau
damping. The lifetime of the collective dipole excitation can be estimated to be
about 10 fs in large Na clusters [21]. The collectivity is also testiﬁed by reach
particle-hole structure of RPA states.

4.2 Quadrupole and octupole plasmons

27 and oblate Na+

In Figs. 7-8 the photoabsorption cross sections for quadrupole and octupole
plasmons in prolate Na+
35 are presented. Contributions from all
the projections µ are given to demonstrate the role of the deformation broadening.
The ﬁgures show strong Landau damping. Its contribution to the width and
gross structure of plasmons is of the same scale or even larger than from deforma-
tion splitting. The prolate Na+
27 has a strong deformation and we see a distinctive
blueshift of µ-branches of the plasmon with increasing µ. This makes the defor-
mation splitting comparable with Landau damping. The deformation is weaker
in the oblate Na+
35, which makes the deformation splitting less pronounced than
Landau damping.

Both, quadrupole and octupole plasmons, are well concentrated (especially
in the less deformed Na+
35), which helps their experimental observation. The
plasmons have a high-energy tail. Analysis of structure of main RPA states
from the plasmon region shows that they have about the same character as in the
dipole case. There is initially a collective multipole plasmon which is then quickly
Landau damped and fragmented over the many nearby particle-hole states.

As is seen from the ﬁgures, photoabsorption cross sections for quadrupole and
octupole plasmons are 105 and 1010 times weaker than in the dipole case. Both
plasmons share the energy region with the all dominating dipole plasmon and
so should be completely masked by the latter. Strong Landau damping of the
plasmons additionally decreases their chance to be observed in photoabsorption.
However, following the estimates [45], inelastic electron scattering could resolve
these states. At certain angles of outcoming electron, contributions of λ = 2 and
3 plasmons to the cross section can successfully compete with the dipole contri-
bution. The reaction is very demanding as it requires an intense, monochromatic
and well collimated low-energy electron beam. However, progress of experimental
techniques gives us some hope. SRPA results can be used in such experiments as
a ﬁrst guide for plasmon energies and strength distributions.

5 Conclusions

The separable RPA (SRPA), a self-consistent approach to RPA, is presented in
connection with investigation of multipole plasmons in deformed clusters. Both
ground state properties and RPA response are calculated using the same Kohn-
Sham functional for axial shapes. Due to self-consistent factorization of the resid-
ual interaction, SRPA dramatically simpliﬁes RPA calculations. At the same
time, the method ensures high accuracy of the calculations. As compared with
other RPA methods, SRPA provides a comprehensive treatment of Landau damp-
ing with a minimal computational eﬀort. This is crucial for deformed systems
where one deals with an impressive particle-hole conﬁguration space.

SRPA has been applied to dipole, quadrupole and octupole plasmons in a va-
riety of axial clusters. The main attention was paid to the dipole plasmon. Light,
medium and heavy clusters of both prolate and oblate shapes were covered. Both
quadrupole and hexadecapole deformations were taken into account. Contribu-
tions to the plasmon from both ground and isomeric states were analyzed. Good
agreement with available experimental data was achieved.

Unlike light axial clusters, where dipole plasmon has a typical two-peak struc-
ture reﬂecting the deformation splitting, the dipole spectra in medium and heavy
deformed clusters show usually a broad bump with relatively small variations of
the shape. The deformation splitting is masked by strong Landau damping which
inhibits a direct determination of ground state deformations from the spectra.
Moreover, such clusters have shape isomers which further overlay the spectra. As
a result, a correct treatment of plasmon properties is possible only on the grounds
of fully microscopic calculations taking into account all these eﬀects. SRPA is a
promising method for such investigations.

Quadrupole and octupole spectra were shown to stay well concentrated in
spite of the deformation splitting and Landau damping. Both spectra have a
considerable high-energy tail. The quadrupole and octupole spectra cannot be
observed directly in photoabsorption experiments but there is some hope to dis-
entangle them in inelastic electron scattering.

Expression (63) shows that coupling of oscillations of given multipolarity (λkµ)
with the spherical (˜λ = 0) and deformed (˜λ = 2, 4, ..) parts of the density leads to
˜λ+λk. Thus the residual interaction driven
a family of terms with
by the operator (63) takes into account not only the deformation distortions of
the ground state density but also the coupling of µπ modes with diﬀerent λ. This
coupling is pertinent only to deformed systems (see, e.g. discussion in [13]).

Appendix C

Here we will comment some essential points concerning the scaling (32), choice

of input operators fλkpkµ(r), and convergence of the SRPA results.

−

Time-odd hermitian generators ˆPλkpkµ(r) =

i[ˆh0(r), fλkpkµ(r)] entering the
scaling result in time-even paths αk(t). The generators can be considered as
momenta conjugate to time-even hermitian coordinate-like operators fλkpkµ(r).
Since in our case all the dynamics is provided by the time-even electron density,
there is no any need in time-even generators. This explains why the scaling
includes not full but single-particle Hamiltonian.
Indeed, if separable residual
interaction in a schematic full Hamiltonian involves only time-even hermitian
ˆQk(r)-operators, then

(64)

since averaged commutators between hermitian operators of the same time-parity
is zero.

It is easy to see from (32) that collective motion is determined by input
operators fλkpkµ(r). The choice of the operators is motivated by physical reasons.
The number of the operators should be as small as possible to minimize the
computational eﬀort and, at the same time, should be suﬃcient to ensure the
convergence of the results. Speciﬁcally, if we study response of the system to an
external ﬁeld, then one of the operators must take the form of such ﬁeld. One
input operator is usually not enough to reproduce the true residual interaction,
even if the separable interaction is constructed self-consistently. To overcome this
trouble, we exploit the idea of the local RPA [26, 27] to use not one but several
input operators. In the local RPA the cluster is treated as a system of several
coupled oscillators, which allows to describe the gross structure of the resonance.
Instead, SRPA can be viewed as a system of coupled schematic RPAs. The
operators fλkpkµ(r) are chosen so that the corresponding operators of the residual
interaction, ˆQk, have maxima at diﬀerent slices of the system, including both
surface and interior. Such input operators can be intuitively associated with
diﬀerent external probes causing the response of diﬀerent parts of the system.
Besides, several operators allow the system to relax additionally, which ﬁnally
leads to high accuracy of the method [29]. The number of input operators is
dictated by convergence of the results and usually 3-6 operators are enough.

27 and oblate Na+

Fig. 9 demonstrates the relative role of diﬀerent input operators in forming the
dipole plasmon. Prolate Na+
35 are considered as typical examples.
It is seen that the residual interaction posed by the leading input operator rY1µ
2.5 eV.
shifts the unperturbed dipole strength from 1-1.5 eV to the energy
This operator is enough to get the correct excitation energy. However, there still
exists an artiﬁcial high energy strength at 3.5-5 eV, which is conﬁrmed neither
by experimental data nor by the TDLDA results. In fact it is a consequence of a
poor separable approximation. Involving additional dipole input operators (panel

∼

c)) weakens the artiﬁcial strength. At the same time, the ﬁrst operator is still
leading. Its contribution remains to be overwhelming in most of the RPA states.
The panel d) demonstrates the minor role of octupole operators responsible for
the deformation coupling of the dipole and octupole modes with µ = 0, 1. Our
calculations performed for dipole, quadrupole and octupole plasmons in a variety
of deformed clusters show that the deformation coupling of diﬀerent multipole
modes with a given µ is usually negligible. However, the deformation leads to a
strong splitting of the plasmons to branches with diﬀerent µ (see panel e) and
Figs. 3-6). The comparison with experimental data for the dipole plasmon, given
in Figs. 4-5, shows that SRPA correctly describes the deformation splitting.

Fig. 10 compares the dipole strength calculated within exact RPA and SRPA.
Cluster Na+
53, being in focus of the discussion above, is chosen as a typical example
for the comparison. For the simplicity, only µ = 0 dipole mode is considered. The
ﬁgure demonstrates good agreement which justiﬁes high accuracy of SRPA.

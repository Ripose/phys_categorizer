Abstract. We have theoretically studied the eﬀect of dissociative autoionization on the photoelectron energy

spectrum in (1 + 2)-photon above threshold ionization (ATI) of H2 molecules. We have considered excitation

from the ground X 1Σ+

g (v = 0, j) state to the doubly excited autoionizing states of 1Σ+

u and 1Πu symmetry,

via the intermediate resonant B1Σ+

u (v = 5, j) states. We have shown that the photoelectron energy spectrum

is oscillatory in nature and shows three distinct peaks above the photoelectron energy 0.7 ev. This feature

has been observed in a recent experiment by Rottke et. al., J. Phys. B 30, 4049(1997).

I. Introduction

Studies on dissociative photoionization in molecular hydrogen is being persued for several years, almost two

decades, both experimentally and theoretically. In this process the molecule is excited above the dissociation

threshold of the molecular ion by the single or multiphoton absorption and the doubly excited autoionizing

states play a signiﬁcant role to determine the photoelectron and the atomic ion spectrum. In most of the

single photon experiments (Chung et al 1993, Dehmer and Dill 1978, Gardner and Samson 1975, Glass-

Maujean 1986, Glass-Maujean et al 1995, He et al 1995, Ito et al 1988, 1996, Latimer et al 1992, 1993,

Strathdee and Browning 1976) the molecule is excited from the ground ro-vibrational level of the ground

electronic X 1Σ+

g state to the dissociation continuum above the ionization threshold leaving the signature of

autoionization on the dissociative ionization yields. In most of the multiphoton experiments (Anderson et al

1984, Cornaggia et al 1986, Normand et al 1986, Pratt et al, 1986, 1987, Verschuur et al 1988, 1989, Xu et

al 1989), the molecule is excited from the ground state to just above the ionization continuum (and below

the dissociation continuum) or above the dissociation continuum, via intermediate resonant rovibrational

level of B1Σ+

u , E, F 1Σ+

g or C1Πu states. In the above experiments, when the molecule is excited below the

dissociation threshold (i.e. when only the bound molecular ions are produced in diﬀerent rovibrational levels),

the role of doubly excited states on rovibrational branching of the molecular ion has been studied; also, when

the molecule is excited above the dissociation threshold (i.e. when atomic ions and neutrals are produced

as dissociative ionization products together with the bound molecular ions), the eﬀect of autoionization

via doubly excited states on the atomic ion spectrum and the photoelectron spectrum (PES), have been

studied. Several theoretical studies ( Chupka 1987, Ganguly et al 1986, Ganguly and Rai Dastidar 1988,

Hazi 1974, Hickman 1987, Kanfer and Shapiro 1983, Kirby et al 1979, 1981, Rai Dastidar et al 1986) have

revealed that autoionization via doubly excited autoionizing (AI) states play a dominant role in determining

the autoionization lineshape and the spectrum of ionization yields i.e. photoelectrons and photoions. It has

been shown that the interference of autoionization with ionization (Fano 1961), leaves its signature on (i) the

autoionization lineshape, (ii) the rovibrational branching of the molecular ion in the ground state and (iii)

the spectrum of the dissociative ionization products (i.e. atomic ions and photoelectrons), for the excitation

2

above the dissociation threshold of the molecular ion.

For the single photon excitation from the ground state, only the ungerade states can be accessed and

the lowest of these series is situated approximately 25.5 ev above the ground state. In this case the Franck-

condon transition occurs at very low intenuclear distances (around R = 1.4a.u.) and at very high continuum

energy. But in case of resonance enhanced (m+n)-photon transition, the molecule is selectively excited

to an intermediate rovibrational level of a Rydberg state and hence the Franck-condon trasition to the

autoionizing state occurs at large internuclear distance. Therefore, in this REMPI ( resonance enhanced

multiphoton ionization ) technique, the initial condition for dissociative ionization can be changed and the

molecule can be excited to diﬀerent continuum energies, much below the energy, reached in the single photon

transition. Recently, experimental study (Rottke et al 1997) on (3 + 2)-photon dissociative ionization of H2

molecules has been done by selectively exciting the B1Σ+

u (v = 5, j) levels, from the ground X 1Σ+

g (v = 0, j)

states by three photon absorption and then to the dissociative continuum by two-photon absorption from

these intermediate resonant levels of B1Σ+

u (v = 5, j) state. Angle resolved photoelectron spectrum (PES)

and ion spectrum have been studied and it has been found that the PES gives oscillatory structure with

increase in energy.

In the present study, an attempt has been made to explain theoretically the origin of such oscillatory be-

haviour of PES. In this calculation we have considered (1 + 2)-photon dissociative ionization of H2 molecules.

The transition scheme considered here is shown schematically in Fig. 1. By the single photon transition,

the molecule is ﬁrst excited resonantly to the B1Σ+

u (v = 5, j) state from the ground X 1Σ+

g (v = 0, j) state

of the H2 molecule and by the subsequent two-photon transition the molecule is excited from this inter-

mediate rovibrational level of B1Σ+

u state to the dissociative continuum of the molecular ion in the ground

state (X 2Σ+

g ). In this transition, the doubly excited states of ungerade symmetry are excited and hence the

dissociative autoionization process via these AI states contributes to the PES. Our aim here is to show that

the dissociative autoionization process can give rise to oscillatory photoelectron spectrum, as observed in

the recent experiment (Rottke et al 1997).

In the experiment, the H2 molecule is ﬁrst excited from the ground X 1Σ+

g (v = 0) state to the B1Σ+

u (v = 5)

state by three photon absorption considering three transition schemes:

(i)P (1) : X 1Σ+

g (v = 0, j = 1) → B1Σ+

u (v = 5, j = 0)

(ii)R(0) : X 1Σ+

g (v = 0, j = 0) → B1Σ+

u (v = 5, j = 1)

(iii)R(2) : X 1Σ+

g (v = 0, j = 2) → B1Σ+

u (v = 5, j = 3)

and then by two photon transition to the dissociative continuum and autoionizing states of ungerade

symmetry. In our calculation we have considered (Fig. 1) single photon transition from the ground X 1Σ+

g (v =

0, j = 0, 1, 2) levels to the diﬀerent rotational levels of B1Σ+

u (v = 5) state by three transition schemes

mentioned above and then two photon transition from B1Σ+

u (v = 5) state with rotational quantum numbers

J = 0,1 and 3 to the continuum above the dissociation threshold.

In this process, excitation to four

autoionizing states, two lowest AI states of 1Σ+

u symmetry and the two lowest AI states of 1Πu symmetry in

the Q1 series has been considered. To get the photoelectron spectrum, the autoionization decay from these

AI states to the diﬀerent dissociation continuua of the ground X 2Σ+

g state of the hydrogen molecular ion

has been studied.

III. Theory

We have used the resolvent operator technique to obtain the dissociative ionization and autoionization rate.

In this technique a set of equations for the matrix elements of resolvent operator G(z) = 1

z−H , with respect

to product states, such as |gi|ni, |ii|n − 1i, |ai|n − 2i, |c1i|n − 2i, |bi|n − 3i and |c2i|n − 3i. Here, |gi

and |ii are the ground and the intermediate resonant states of the bare molecule, |ai and |bi are the AI

states of diﬀerent symmetry excited by the single photon and two photon absorption from the intermediate

state of the molecule respectively and the continuua |c1i and |c2i are excited by the single photon and two

photon absorption from the intermediate state respectively (see Fig. 1). Hence the continuua are of diﬀerent

symmetry. The continuum |c2i will be of the same symmetry as the intermediate resonant state |ii and

the continuum |c1i will be of opposite symmetry. The |ni ’s are the photon number states. H is the total

4

hamiltonian of the molecule+photon system. z is the complex energy of the system and the imaginary part

of z gives the decay rate of the system. For the (1 + 2)-photon transitions considered here, the equations for

the matrix elements of resolvent operator are given as follows:

and Ec2 = ǫc2 + (n − 3)¯hω are the energies for the product states, i.e. the ground, intermediate, autoionizing

states and the two continuua respectively. Here ǫ’s are the energies for the bare molecular states. Djk’s

are the dipole transition moments between the product states j and k. The summation over b indicates

that contribution from all the autoionizing states excited by this transition schemes has been considered.

Formally obtaining Gc1g and Gc2g from equations (5) and (6) and substituting in equations (2),(3) and (4)

j,k corresponds to bound product states; cp,q corresponds to product states for continuua; Xcqk and Yjcp

correspond to coupling terms between the continuum cp,q and the bound states designated by k and j

respectively. Here A =

1

the factor A, of the bound states designated by j respectively; Γa,b and Sa,b are the autoionization width and

the shift, divided by the factor A, of the autoionizing states designated by a and b respectively, due to the

conﬁguration interaction couplings Vac1 and Vbc2 with the continuum adjacent to the AI states. The terms

involving integration over continuum (as in Qia, Qib, Qab etc.) can be expressed as the sum of the principal

value part and the imaginary part in the usual manner. In the present work we have neglected the principal

value part and used the pole approximation to derive the ﬁnal formula for autoionization rate. Equations

(8) → (10) can be rewritten in terms of the detunings (δi, δa and δb) from the intermediate and two AI

states respectively by substituting z = Zg + Eg in the above equations. By solving above equations one

can formally obtain the matrix elements for the resolvent operator and by inverse Laplace transformation

of these matrix elements one can get corresponding matrix elements for the evolution operator. Hence the

probability for ionization can be written as: P (t) = 1 − |Ugg(t)|2 − |Uig(t)|2 − |Uag(t)|2 − |Ubg(t)|2.

6

In the weak ﬁeld limit i.e. considering dipole transition strength from the ground state to the inter-

mediate state to be much weaker than that for the ionizing transitions and the autoionizing decay, one can

write down Ggg = 1

IV. Calculations

In the present study we have considered contribution from the dissociative autoionization via two lowest

AI states of 1Σ+

u symmetry and two lowest AI states of 1Πu symmetry. The energies and autoionization

widths for these four states are available in the literature Guberman 1983, Kirby et al 1981, Tennyson

1996). As mentioned before, we have considered here (1+2)-photon transition from the ground state to the

autoionizing states via the intermediate resonant B1Σ+

u state. Therefore, to calculate the two-photon term

via the continuum, one needs to have the electronic wavefunctions for the AI states. The wavefunctions

for two lowest AI states of 1Σ+

u symmetry have been obtained by minimizing the energy variationally. The

molecular basis set used is a multi-conﬁguration minimal basis constructed with linear combination of Slater-

type atomic orbitals. We have used seven conﬁguration wavefunctions constructed with atomic orbitatls of

s and p symmetry and the principal quantum number upto 4. At each value of R (internuclear separation),

7

all the exponents have been varied to obtain minimum energy. The energies obtained are in good agreement

with the previous values (Guberman 1983) except at lower values of internuclear seperation R ≤ 1.4a.u..

Calculated energies for the second 1Σ+

u AI state diﬀer by ≤ .006 a.u. from the previous values (Guberman

1983), except at R = 1.0 a.u., where the diﬀerence is .017 a.u.. For the ﬁrst 1Σ+

u AI state, the diﬀerence in

energies (our results and Guberman’s results) are ≤ .0086 a.u., except at R = 1.0 and R = 1.4 a.u., where

the diﬀerences are .023 a.u. and .012 a.u. respectively. The electronic wavefunctions for the ground and

the intermediate states have been obtained from our previous calculations (Khatun and Rai Dastidar 1995).

For the calculation of the complex nuclear wavefunctions using complex potential for the AI states, we have

used modiﬁed Numerov method (Lane and Geltman 1967, Rai Dastidar and Rai Dastidar 1979).

To calculate two-photon dipole transition moment between B1Σ+

u state and the AI states (i.e.

to

evaluate Qib; see section III) we have used the pole approximation to integrate over the continuum energy

(Ec1 ), and hence considered contributions from the continuua associated with the bound vibrational levels of

the X 2Σ+

g state of H +

2 ion, which are energetically below the continuum energy excited by the ﬁrst photon

from the B1Σ+

u state. We have used the multipolar gauge to evaluate dipole transition moments, but one

can also use the minimal coupling gauge. Since, in the present work, the two-photon term acts as a constant

(with respect to PE energy) multiplying factor to the autoionization amplitude-square (see equation 12),

the structure of the PES is independent of the choice of gauge. However, the scaling factor for PES can be

diﬀerent, depending on the magnitude of two-photon term in two diﬀerent gauges. For the present study

we have calculated the two-photon dipole transition moments for the transition from the B1Σ+

u state to

the two lowest AI states of 1Σ+

u symmetry only. It is found that the second AI state of 1Σ+

u symmetry is

energetically very close to the lowest AI state of 1Πu symmetry (Guberman 1983, Tennyson 1996)) and the

diﬀerence between the values of eﬀective principal quantum numbers for these two states are also very small

(Tennyson 1996). Therefore for the present calculation we have used the same two-photon dipole transition

term for the transition to the lowest AI state of 1Πu symmetry as that calculated for the transition to the

second AI state of 1Σ+

u symmetry. For the second 1Πu state we have used the same two-photon term and

it is found that the contribution from this second 1Πu state is much smaller than that from the second 1Σ+
u

state and the lowest 1Πu state.

8

The electronic conﬁguration interaction term between AI state and the continuum has been derived as

Vbc2 (R) =

q

Γb(R)
2π , where autoionization widths Γb(R) have been obtained from the literature (Tennyson

1996) and this value of Vbc2 has been considered to be arising from l = 1 partial wave only. This is a

valid approximation, since l = 1 is the most dominant contribution for autoionization from 1Σ+

u AI states

(Kirby et al 1981). To obtain autoionization amplitude, integration over nuclear coordinates have been

done considering explicit dependence of the electronic transition amplitudes on the internuclear seperation.

Similarly, to obtain dipole transition amplitudes, explicit dependence of electronic dipole transition moments

on the internuclear separation (for bound-bound transition) and also on the photoelectron energy (for bound-

continuum transition) has been considered for nuclear integration.

The autoionizing states lying above the dissociation continuum of the molecular ion can decay into the

dissociation continuua lying between the ﬁnal continuum energy excited by two-photon transition from the

B1Σ+

u state and the dissociation threshold of the ground state (X 2Σ+

g ) of the molecular ion. Hence the total

energy Et, can be expressed as Et = Ee + De, where Ee is the photoelectron energy and De is the energy of

the dissociation continuum of the molecular ion. We have calculated the dissociative autoionization matrix

element for the transitions to a range of dissociation continuum of the ground state of the H +

2 ion, chosen

(arbitrarily) to lie on a grid of .01 ev spacing.

V. Results and Discussions

A schematic diagram for the transitions considered here is shown in ﬁg.1. For diﬀerent molecular potential

energy curves we refer to Fig.1 of Rottke et al, 1997. The two continuua shown in Fig. 1 are of diﬀerent

symmetry and correspond to the ﬁrst ionization threshold (H +

2 (X 2Σ+

g ) + e) of the neutral molecule. Results

for three diﬀerent transition schemes (P (1), R(0) and R(2)), i.e. for ionizing transitions from J = 0, J = 1

and J = 3 of B1Σ+

u (v = 5) state are shown in Figs. 2,3 and 4 respectively. In these ﬁgures we have plotted

the dissociative autoionization rate divided by I 3F ( where I is the laser intensity and F is the line shape

factor, see equ. 12), as a function of photoelectron energy. The factor I 3F , which is independent of the

photoelectron energy, merely plays the role of a scaling factor as far as the shape and the structure of the

9

PES is concerned. The experimental PES is given in arbitrary units and here we compare our theoretical

PES (scaled by the factor I 3F ) with experiment. It is to be mentioned here that, for photoelectron energies

less than 0.7 ev, the contribution from the ionization of neutral atoms is dominating (Rottke et al 1997)

and hence the eﬀect of dissociative autoionization will be prominent only for energies ≥ 0.7 ev. Therefore,

we will discuss the features obtained in PES for energies above 0.7 ev ( experimental results also show PES

above 0.7 ev, see ﬁg.2 of Rottke et al, 1997).

For this calculation we have taken A = 1, since the value of |Dc1c2|2 is much less than unity for this

calculation. The continuum-continuum transition amplitude (|Dc1c2 |) will be signiﬁcant only for photoelec-

tron energies very close to each other (Gordon 1929) and for the present study the photoelectron energies

for the transition to the lower continuum ( due to the absorption of single photon from the B1Σ+

u (v = 5)

state ) are less than .02 a.u. (i.e.

less than 0.54 ev ). Hence the value of |Dc1c2 |2 will be signiﬁcant for

photoelectron energies less than 0.54 ev for continuum-continuum transition. To get an estimate, we have

calculated electronic dipole transition moment for continuum-continuum transition (Gordon 1929) and the

overlap between the three lowest vibrational levels of molecular ion in the ground state, with diﬀerent dis-

sociation continuum of the same. It is found that the contribution from this term is orders of magnitude

smaller than unity (Rai Dastidar 1996).

In the ﬁgures (2, 3 and 4), individual contributions to dissociative autoionization from four ( ﬁrst two

1Σ+

u and ﬁrst two 1Πu ) autoionizing states have been shown, together with their sum. It is found that the

PES is oscillatory in nature and the dissociative autoionization from the second AI state of 1Σ+

u symmetry

is the most important contribution. We have checked that the oscillation is essentially the same as in the

Franck-Condon overlap (mod-squared) between the complex nuclear wavefunction of the autoionizing state

and the nuclear continuum of the molecular ion in the ground state, as a function of photoelectron energy.

The PES for autoionization from three AI ( second 1Σ+

u and the two 1Πu) states show three peaks above the

photoelectron energy greater than 0.7 ev and the peak positions are almost the same for these three PES.

But the contribution from the lowest 1Σ+

u state is much smaller than that from the second 1Σ+

u state and

shows an out of phase oscillation. The presence of three peaks in PES, above 0.7 ev of photoelectron energy,

has also been experimentally observed (Rottke et al 1997). From the ﬁgure for PES (Fig. 2 of Rottke et

10

al 1997), the peak positions can be approximately calculated and we ﬁnd that the peaks are shited towards

higher energy than that obtained in the present calculation. These shifts are diﬀerent for three transition

schemes and the values are approximately within 0.23 − 0.24 ev, 0.17 − 0.2 ev and 0.04 − 0.09 ev for the ﬁrst,

second and the third peak respectively. It is to be mentioned here that the shifts of the autoionizing states

due to autoionization decay have not been considered in our calculation. By using the approximate formula

(Ganguly and Rai Dastidar 1988, Olsen 1982) Sb = − 3

2π Γb, one can calculate the approximate values of

shift (Sb) for the second AI state of 1Σ+

u symmetry (using the values of width tabulated by Tennyson, 1996).

Typical values of shift varies from −0.02 to −0.16 ev, in the range of internuclear separation, R = 3.0 to 4.0

and since this value is subtracted from the energy of the AI state, electronic potential energies will be shifted

upwards. Hence the peak positions in ﬁgs. 2, 3 and 4 will be shifted towards higher energy and this shifting

will be diﬀerent for diﬀerent photoelectron energies. The values of shifts are 0.2, 0.16 and 0.14 ev for the

ﬁrst, second and the third peak respectively. It is found that, after shifting, the peak positions are almost

the same as those observed in the experiment. It is within .03 to .04 ev, .01 to .04 ev and .05 to 0.1 ev for

the ﬁrst, second and the third peak respectively. But for comparing our results with the experimental PES,

the resolution factor for the experiment has to be taken into account (in particular for determining the peak

positions). It has been mentioned by Rottke et al, 1997 that the resolution is .08 ev at 2 ev photoelectron

energy but that for energies lower than 2 ev has not been mentioned. We expect that the resolution will be

better as the photoelectron energy is decreased and we ﬁnd that the agreement is better for the ﬁrst two

peak positions than the third one.

By comparing ﬁgures 2, 3 and 4, it is found that the PES for three transition schemes are of the same

order of magnitude and the PES for transition from J = 1 level (Fig. 3) is greater in magnitude than that

from J = 0 (Fig. 2) and J = 3 (Fig. 4) levels of B1Σ+

u (v = 5) state. However, in the experiment, although

the contribution for these three transition schemes are of the same order (in arbitrary unit), photoelectron

yield for transition from J=0 level of B1Σ+

u (v = 5) state is greater than that from other two transitions.

By analyzing our results, we ﬁnd that the (1+2)-photon term for transition to the second 1Σ+

u AI state is

greater for excitation from j = 0 level of the ground X 1Σ+

g (v = 0) state than that from other j levels. In

the presnt work, we have done ab-initio calculations to obtain the PES for dissociative autoionization from

11

two 1Σ+

u AI states. But to obtain PES from two 1Πu AI states we have used the same (1+2)-photon term

as calculated for second 1Σ+

u state. Hence the scaling factor for contribution from these two AI states (1Πu)

may become diﬀerent for three transition schemes, if the actual values of (1+2)-photon term for excitation

to these two 1Πu states are obtained. Moreover, the values of (1+2)-photon term may diﬀer in two diﬀerent

gauges (minimal coupling and multipolar). Therefore, at this stage, this diﬀerence between our results and

the experiment may arise, as far as the relative magnitudes of three PES (for transitions from J = 0, 1,and

3) are concerned. Nevertheless, further study in this ﬁeld is warranted.

In conclusion, we have shown that the oscillatory nature of the experimentally observed PES in (3+2)-

photon above threshold ionization of H2 molecules, can be accounted for by considering the dissociative

autoionization of the doubly excited autoionizing states (of ungerade symmetry) above the dissociative

ionization threshold.

Figure Captions

ﬁg. 1: Schematic diagram for (1 + 2)-photon above threshold ionization. Two continuua |c1i and |c2i

are of gerade and ungerade symmetry respectively and correspond to the ﬁrst ionization threshold

(H +

2 (X 2Σ+

g ) + e) of the hydrogen molecule.

ﬁg. 2: Dissociative autoionization rate divided by I 3F (see text, equ. 12), where I is the laser intensity

and F is the lineshape factor, has been plotted as a function of photoelectron energy, for two-photo

ionizing transition from rotational level, J=0 of B1Σ+

u (v = 5) state. Contributions from four AI

states and their sum have been shown separately. Legends for the curves are: - - - contribution

from the lowest 1Σ+

u AI state; **** same from second 1Σ+

u AI state; ++++ same from lowest 1Πu

AI state; ♦♦♦ same from the second 1Πu state and – sum total of the four contributions.

ﬁg. 3: Same as in Fig. 2, for transition from J=1 level of B1Σ+

u (v = 5) state.

ﬁg. 4: Same as in Fig. 2, for transition from J=3 level of B1Σ+

u (v = 5) state.

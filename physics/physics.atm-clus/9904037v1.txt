We report a variational calculation of ground state energies and radii of 4HeN droplets (3 ≤ N ≤ 40),
using the atom-atom interaction HFD-B(HE). The trial wave function has a simple structure,
combining two- and three-body correlation functions coming from a translationally invariant
conﬁguration-interaction description, and Jastrow-type short-range correlations. The calculated
ground state energies diﬀer by around 2% from the diﬀusion Monte Carlo results.

The research on liquid helium clusters has attracted a
great interest both experimentally and theoretically [1,2].
This research allows for the analysis of the evolution of
various physical properties for increasing size of the sys-
tem, going from single atoms to the bulk. Helium clusters
are expected to remain liquid under all conditions of for-
mation, oﬀering thus the possibility to study ﬁnite-size
eﬀects in the superﬂuid state [3]. Moreover, it has been
suggested that Bose condensation could be detected by
means of helium atom-cluster collisions [4]. The experi-
mental research has faced the diﬃculties of size detecting
the clusters. Recently, molecular beam diﬀraction from
a transmission gratting [5] has proven to be successful to
detect even the 4He dimer [6], giving further impetus to
the study of helium clusters.

As the atom-atom interaction is well-known and rela-
tively simple, the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation
has been obtained using several microscopic methods,
mainly based on Monte Carlo techniques [7,8,9,10,11].
Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) calculations, using a
Jastrow-like ansatz for the many-body wave function, are
currently used for systems dominated by strong short-
range interactions. The VMC wave functions are the
input for diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC), Green function
Monte Carlo or path integral techniques which provide
essentially exact, within statistical errors, ground state
energies of 4He clusters at zero temperature. Conversely,
these calculations constitute a useful benchmark to test
other many-body methods.

In this work we present a new method of obtaining
high-quality variational wave functions to describe small
bosonic clusters. The basic idea is to write the trial wave
function as the product of three terms, each of them
with well deﬁned roles. The ﬁrst term is the familiar
two-body Jastrow correlation factor, which controls the
strong atom-atom repulsion at very short distances. The
second term is related to a single-particle description of
the cluster and is written as the product of N single
particle wave functions referred to the center-of-mass co-

ordinate; it provides the required conﬁnement of the con-
stituents and ﬁxes basically the size of the droplet. Fi-
nally, the third term corresponds to a special version of
the conﬁguration interaction (CI) expansion describing
two- and three-particle excitations, its role being to in-
corporate ﬁne details to the wave function for medium
and long ranges, as well as some collective eﬀects.
In
summary, the trial wave functions we shall consider to
describe the ground state of 4HeN clusters is

introduced by McMillan [12] many years ago for the de-
scription of the homogeneous liquid using a 12-6 Lennard-
Jones interaction, with the value ν = 5 as required by
Kato’s cusp condition. Many VMC calculations have
shown that this form is also appropriate when dealing
with interactions of the Aziz type. For instance, in Ref.
[10] ﬁxed values b = 3˚A, ν = 5 have been used for the
interaction HFDHE2 [13], independently of the number
of constituents in the cluster. It makes sense to keep the
same values for all the clusters, because this pair corre-
lation should be determined only by the two-body inter-
action potential. We have slightly modiﬁed these values,
employing b = 2.95˚Aand ν = 5.2 in our calculations with
the interaction HFD-B(HE) [14]. Note that, contrarily
to other studies, we are considering for the Jastrow term
only the dominant part at very short-ranges.

be a very accurate representation of the correlation func-

included, with the only restriction of having a square in-

we ﬁx one of them, say β1, to zero. In this way we

cover the three possibilities contained in the ansatz wave
function: restricting the three labels p, q, r to 1, we deal
(up to a normalization constant) with the correlated state
ΦJ ; keeping only two of these labels equal to 1, amounts
to put on top of that state the linear two-body correla-
tions; ﬁnally the unrestricted choice corresponds to the
complete ansatz. Calculations presented later on will be
referred as J, J-CI2 and J-CI3 results, respectively.

Our contribution to the variational description of the
clusters is the term within parentheses in Eq.(1), with the
pair f2 and triplet f3 correlations, which we have called
above conﬁguration interaction and will be abridged as
CI2 and CI3 respectively. In previous works [17] we have
extensively applied the CI2 scheme to the description of
light nuclear systems, with less singular interactions than
the usual atom-atom potentials. The method is based on
a linearized version of the coupled cluster method (CCM)
[15] at the SUB(2) and SUB(3) truncation approximation
levels, restricted to translationally invariant excitations
up to three particles-three holes. The linearized version
of the CCM has been shown to be equivalent to a special
conﬁguration interaction scheme [16], much more eﬃcient
than the usual CI methods when dealing with realistic in-
teractions. With respect to CCM, the CI scheme loses the
cluster property and the correct scaling with the number
of particles, being unappropriate for extended systems.
However it is much simpler, as far as non-linear terms of
the CCM expansion are absent.

The present mixed J-CI scheme may be compared with
the correlated basis functions (CBF) method as devel-
oped by Feenberg, Clark and Krotscheck [18] for ex-
tended systems, in which Jastrow correlations are com-
bined with non-orthogonal perturbation theory. The key
concept behind both CBF and J-CI methods is to ap-
ply a divide-and-conquer strategy to the determination
of the correlated wave function. It is known that Jastrow
correlations are very well suited to treat the eﬀects of the
(strongly repulsive) short-range part of the interaction,
whereas a CI approach can eﬀectively deal with medium-
and long-range correlations.
In our approach, we sub-
stitute the standard conﬁguration-interaction component
by our conceptually equivalent but signiﬁcantly more ef-
fective translationally invariant CI scheme. Note that
we are combining additive CI and multiplicative Jastrow
correlations.

The CI correlation functions f2 and f3 could be deter-
mined by minimizing the ground state energy, resulting
in a system of coupled integro-diﬀerential equations for
f2 and f3. As a practical alternative we have expanded
these functions in a set of gaussians:

as the guide of a Metropolis random walk [19]. Note
that no substraction of the center-of-mass contribution
is necessary, as we are using a translationally invariant
wave function. The number of unkown amplitudes Cµ
is

can be extracted easily from the general wave function:

indeed, they correspond to the ﬁrst d

matrices and the ﬁrst d amplitudes, with d = 1 and d =

The computational algorithm consists in carrying out

tribution function to evaluate the norm, potential and ki-
netic matrices as given in eqs.(9-11). The only adjustable
parameter to be determined by minimization is α, since
the amplitudes Cµ are self-adjustable. A ﬁnal warning
is in order.
It is well known that calculations involv-
ing the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem like
eq.(8) are prone to numerical instabilities, because the
over-complete basis giving rise to the overlap matrix
N
may have a determinant close to zero. In our case, the
Monte Carlo evaluation of the overlap matrix (9) results
always in a positive matrix, and the possible numerical
instabilities are related only to numerical rounding er-
rors.

Our lowest order approximation (J) should be com-
pared with column VMC. It can be seen that our crude
choice for the two-body Jastrow correlation (2) produces
less binding than the quoted VMC results. The reason
of these diﬀerences is quite clear: once the parameters
b and ν have been ﬁxed, there remains a single varia-
tional parameter (α) in ΦJ .
In contrast, the referred
VMC calculations use more elaborate forms for the trial
wave function, including three-body correlation functions
in some cases, and containing from 5 to 10 parameters.
Note however, that these diﬀerences decrease when N
increases.

The inclusion of the CI correlation function f2 changes
substantially the results. It can be seen that ﬁgures in
columns VMC and J-CI2 are basically the same, within
statistical errors, except for the cluster with N = 40.
The J-CI2 values have been obtained by minimizing the

3

energy with respect to α and the set of ﬁve amplitudes
describing f2. The resulting values of α are given in Ta-
ble I. In some cases we have also performed calculations
including up to nine gaussians.
It turns out that the
binding energy does not change signiﬁcantly, in spite of
a considerably increase of the computing time.

We ﬁnally refer to our best variational results, namely
J-CI3. There are no adjustable parameters in J-CI3, be-
cause we took the value of α which minimizes the J-
CI2 energy and the same set of ﬁve β exponents, the Cµ
amplitudes being determined by solving the generalized
eigenvalue problem. It can be seen in Table I that the
ground state energies provided by the J-CI3 scheme are
above DMC ones by about 2%, except at the extremes
of the table. For N = 3 both J-CI3 and DMC ener-
gies agree within statistical errors, and for N = 20 and
40 the diﬀerences are at the level of 4%.
In any case,
the J-CI3 description always shows a large improvement
with respect to the more elaborate VMC calculations dis-
played in Table I. Moreover, the values obtained for the
unit radius are very close to the values given by DMC
calculations.

It is interesting to show the sensitivity to the value of
the size parameter α of the three levels of approximation.
As a typical example, in Figure 1 are shown our results
for the cluster with N = 8. For completeness this ﬁgure
includes also two horizontal dotted lines, which represent
the optimal VMC and DMC energies, and which are not
related in any form to our parameter α. One observes
that even if there is a strong dependence of J energies
with α, this dependence almost disappears when f2 and
f3 correlations are included. The ﬂatness of J-CI2 and
J-CI3 energies is an indication of the completeness of the
basis used to describe these correlations.

In conclusion, we have presented in this paper a vari-
ational wave function for 4He clusters. A simple Jas-
trow function of McMillan type is suﬃcient to screen
the strong short-range atom-atom repulsion, whereas the
remaining medium- and long-range correlations seem to
be adequately described by linear CI correlation func-
tions. These functions are authomatically determined
once given the size parameter α, which is the only ad-
justable parameter. We have shown that these vari-
ational wave functions produce high-quality results for
small clusters. The method is likely applicable to other
bosonic systems.

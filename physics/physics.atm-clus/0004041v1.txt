Structures and Stabilities of (CaO)nCa2+ (n=1–29) Cluster Ions: An alternative

interpretation of the experimental mass spectra.

Andr´es Aguado∗ and Jos´e M. L´opez

The structures and relative stabilities of doubly-charged nonstoichiometric (CaO)nCa2+ (n=1–29)
cluster ions and of neutral stoichiometric (MgO)n and (CaO)n (n=3,6,9,12,15,18) clusters are studied
through ab initio Perturbed Ion plus polarization calculations. The large coordination-dependent
polarizabilities of oxide anions favor the formation of surface sites, making the critical cluster size
where anions with bulk coordination ﬁrst appear larger than that expected for purely ionic systems.
Thus, we show that there are substantial structural diﬀerences between alkali halide and alkaline-
earth oxide cluster ions, contrary to what is suggested by the similarities in the experimental mass
spectra. An alternative interpretation of the magic numbers for the case of oxides is proposed,
which involves an explicit consideration of isomer structures diﬀerent from the ground states. A
comparison with the previously studied (MgO)nMg2+ cluster ions suggests a less ionic behaviour
of CaO compared to MgO. Nevertheless, the structures of the doubly charged clusters are rather
similar for the two materials. On the contrary, the study of the neutrals reveals interesting structural
diﬀerences between MgO and CaO, similar to those found in the case of alkali halides.

I. INTRODUCTION

Small clusters are of great interest both to the phys-
ical and chemical communities because of their numer-
ous potential applications (for example, in nanoelectron-
ics or catalysis), and also because one can gain impor-
tant insight into the evolution from atomic and molec-
ular properties to bulk and surface properties. To have
a knowledge of the structures adopted by the clusters
is of paramount importance, as many interesting clus-
ter properties are largely determined by them. From the
theoretical side, to ﬁnd the lowest energy structure for
each cluster is a complicated matter, being the main rea-
son that the number of isomers increase exponentially
with cluster size. Another reasons are that one has to
treat bulklike and surfacelike ions on an equal foot, and
that the number of ions to be explicitely considered in a
cluster is larger than in a bulk or surface study, where
symmetry restrictions impose a number of useful atomic
equivalences. From the experimental side, the problem is
so important that during the approximately 30 years of
intensive cluster research, the main source of structural
information has been theory. Very recently, experimental
techniques like electron diﬀraction from trapped clusters1
or measurements of cluster mobilities2–6 have been suc-
cesfully applied to study the structures of covalent and
ionic clusters. Photoelectron spectroscopy has also been
applied to study isomerization transitions in small al-
kali halide clusters,7 and measurements of ionization po-
tential to detect structural transitions in barium oxide
clusters.8 At the moment, however, these techniques need
parallel theoretical calculations to make a deﬁnite assign-
ment of the observed diﬀraction pattern, mobility or ion-
ization potential to a speciﬁc isomer geometry.

A large amount of theoretical work has been devoted
to metallic, semiconductor and noble gas clusters. The
work on ionic materials has been centered mostly in the
family of alkali halides, and studies of metal oxide clus-

n and (CaO)+

ters have been comparatively scarce, despite their impor-
tance in many branches of surface physics, like heteroge-
neous catalysis or corrotion. Saunders9,10 reported mass
spectra and collision induced fragmentation data for stoi-
chiometric (MgO)+
n cluster ions, Martin and
Bergmann11 published mass spectra of (CaO)nCa2+ clus-
ter ions, and Ziemann and Castleman12–15 performed ex-
perimental measurements of several singly- and doubly-
ionized cluster ions of MgO and CaO by using laser-
ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry. Theoretical
calculations have been performed at diﬀerent levels of ac-
curacy: simple ionic models based on phenomenological
pair potentials were used by Ziemann and Castleman13,14
to explain the global trends found in their experi-
ments; Wilson16 has studied neutral (MgO)n (n≤30)
clusters by using a compressible-ion model17 that in-
cludes coordination-dependent oxide polarizabilities;18,19
semiempirical tight-binding calculations for MgO clusters
were reported by Moukouri and Noguera;20,21 ﬁnally, ab
initio calculations on stoichiometric MgO clusters have
been presented recently by Recio et al.,22,23 Malliavin
and Coudray,24 and de la Puente et al,25 and calculations
on stoichiometric (Li2O)n clusters have been reported by
Finocchi and Noguera.26 Regarding the nonstoichiomet-
ric cluster ions, Aguado et al.27 have studied the struc-
tures and stabilities of (MgO)nMg2+.

Trying to ﬁnd an interpretation of the obtained mass
spectra, Ziemann and Castleman14 performed some
simple pair potential calculations of the structures of
(MgO)nMg2+ cluster ions by using a rigid ion model.
The conclusion of those calculations was that the magic
numbers can be explained in terms of highly compact
structures that can only be obtained for certain cluster
sizes, an interpretation very similar to that found in the
closely related case of alkali halides.28–30 In our previous
work,27 we showed that the structures of (MgO)nMg2+
cluster ions were quite diﬀerent from those of alkali
halides. Speciﬁcally, the inﬂuence of the large and coor-
dination dependent polarizabilities of oxide anions (not

1

included in the rigid ion model) favors the formation of
surface oxide sites, and thus structures with bulk ox-
ide anions (coordination 6) are not energetically com-
petitive until large values of the number of molecules
n are attained. For example, a highly compact 3×3×3
cube (where the notation denotes the number of atoms
along three perpendicular edges) is not the ground state
of (MgO)13Mg2+. Nevertheless, the agreement between
the magic numbers obtained through an examination of
the stabilities of the clusters against the loss of an MgO
molecule and the experimental ones is complete. It is just
the interpretation of them in terms of structures that is
diﬀerent, that is, model-dependent. It is interesting to
study a similar system like calcium oxide in order to as-
sess whether those trends are a general feature of alkaline-
earth oxide clusters or not. Moreover, the experiments
of Saunders9,10 suggest interesting structural diﬀerences
between both materials, as the main fragments observed
after collisions with inert gas ions were (MgO)3 in one
case and (CaO)2 in the other, and the mass spectra of
Ziemann and Castleman14,15 show diﬀerent stabilities in
the small size regime (magic numbers at n=5,8,11 for
(MgO)nMg2+ and at n=5,7,9,11 for (CaO)nCa2+), pro-
viding further motivation for our study. From the theo-
retical point of view, Ca2+ is larger than Mg2+, so we can
expect ionic size packing eﬀects to play an important role
in determining structural diﬀerences. Besides, Ca2+ has
a polarizability approximately 6 times larger than Mg2+,
and the polarizabilities of the oxide anions are also larger
in CaO because the bonding is weaker than in MgO.

In this work we present the results of an extensive and
systematic study of (CaO)nCa2+ cluster ions with n up
to 29. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in
Section II we give a brief resume of the theoretical model
employed, as full exposition have been already reported
in previous works.28 The results are presented in Section
III, and the main conclusions to be extracted from our
study in Section IV.

II. THE AIPI MODEL AND POLARIZATION

CORRECTIONS

The theoretical

foundation of the ab initio per-
turbed ion model31 lies in the theory of electronic
separability,32,33 and its practical implementation in the
Hartree-Fock (HF) version of the theory of electronic
separability.34,35 Very brieﬂy, the HF equations of the
cluster are solved stepwise, by breaking the cluster wave
function into local group functions (ionic in nature in
our case).
In each iteration, the total energy is min-
imized with respect to variations of the electron den-
sity localized in a given ion, with the electron densities
of the other ions kept frozen. In the subsequent itera-
tions each frozen ion assumes the role of nonfrozen ion.
When the self-consistent process ﬁnishes,28 the outputs
are the total cluster energy and a set of localized wave
functions, one for each geometrically nonequivalent ion of
the cluster. These localized cluster-consistent ionic wave
functions are then used to estimate the intraatomic cor-
relation energy correction through Clementi’s Coulomb-
Hartree-Fock method.36,37 The large multi-zeta basis sets

of Clementi and Roetti38 are used for the description of
the ions. At this respect, our optimizations have been
performed using basis sets (5s4p) for M g2+ and (5s5p)
for O2−, respectively. Inclusion of diﬀuse basis functions
has been checked and shown unnecessary. One important
advantage coming from the localized nature of the model
is the linear scaling of the computational eﬀort with the
number of atoms in the cluster. This has allowed us to
study clusters with as many as 59 atoms at a reasonable
computational cost.

In our previous work on alkaline-earth oxide clusters,27
we concluded that the aiPI model is equivalent to a ﬁrst-
principles version of the semiempirical breathing shell
model.39 The binding energy of the cluster can be written
as a sum of deformation and interaction terms

where the diﬀerent energy contributions are: the clas-
sical electrostatic interaction energy between point-like
ions; the correction to this energy due to the ﬁnite exten-
sion of the ionic wave functions; the exchange interaction
energy between the electrons of ion R and those of the
other ions in the cluster; and the overlap repulsive energy
contribution.33 The deformation energy term ER
def is the
self-energy of the ion R. It is an intrinsically quantum-
mechanical many-body term that accounts for the energy
change associated to the compression of the ionic wave
functions upon cluster formation, and incorporates the
correlation contribution to the binding energy. As the
model assumes, for computational simplicity, that the
ion densities have spherical symmetry, the only relevant
terms that are lacking from the ab initio description are
the polarization terms. In a polarizable point-ion approx-
imation, the polarization contribution to the deformation
and interaction energies is

to the interaction energy are the monopole-dipole and

to the deformation energy represents the energy cost of
deforming the charge density of the ion to create the
dipole moment. The point-ion approximation provides
just the asymptotic part of the polarization interaction

energy, that is, it is exact only for large ionic separa-
tions. As soon as the ions begin to overlap, there is an
important short-range contribution to the induced dipole
moments,40–43 which is of opposite sign to the asymptotic
limit for anions and may in some speciﬁc cases reverse
the sign of the asymptotic value. These eﬀects can be
easily acomodated in the formalism by substituting the
asymptotic value of the induced dipole moments by the

rection has been explained in Ref. 40, and is associated
to the ﬁnite extents of the electron densities of the an-
ions and cations. Then, f is a short-range function that
switchs on as the cation-anion overlap becomes apprecia-
ble. Madden and coworkers43 have employed the Tang

This is a smoothed step function passing from zero for
large r to −c for r=0. The range of r values at which
f becomes signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero is primarily
determined by the range parameter b.

We have included the polarization terms in the self-
consistent process with this parameterised method, that
calculates the induced dipole moments from eq. (5) and
the correction to the deformation and interaction ener-
gies from eqs. (3) and (4), respectively. The “enlarged”
aiPI+polarization model thus obtained accounts for all
the relevant physical interactions. The relaxation of the
assumption of spherical symmetry being computation-
ally expensive, the price to be paid is the inclusion in the
model of a set of parameters, namely, the polarizabili-
ties αR and the range parameter b. Appropriate values
for the other two constants c and kmax can be taken
equal to the bulk values (c=-3 and kmax=4).43 Given the
meaning of the range parameter b, inversely related to
half the interionic distance between ﬁrst neighbors, one
might expect diﬀerent values of b for clusters as com-
pared to bulk materials if the interionic distances are
substantially diﬀerent. As a matter of fact, the evolu-
tion of those distances with cluster size is not too com-
plicated in the case of ionic clusters.25,28–30 Speciﬁcally,
the average interionic distance d initially increases quite
abruptly with the number of molecules n, and then slowly
approaches the bulk limit. As a consequence of this be-
haviour, we will see that the bulk value (b=0.75 a.u.)43

is appropriate for all (CaO)nCa2+ clusters with n ≥ 4.
Diﬀerent values of b are needed just for n <4 to avoid
overpolarization problems.16 Regarding the polarizabili-
ties, oxide anions have the interesting property of show-
ing strongly coordination-dependent values. In fact, the
O2− anion does not exist as a free ion, which is equiv-
alent to an inﬁnite polarizability; in the solid phase it
is stabilized by the crystal environment and has a ﬁnite
material-dependent polarizability. Wilson16 has interpo-
lated between those two limits and gives values for the
coordination-dependent values of α(O2−) in MgO. We
have assumed that the ratio of the bulk oxide polarizabil-
ities for MgO and CaO (αbulk(O2− : CaO)/αbulk(O2− :
M gO)=1.469)43 is independent of the oxide coordina-
tion, and have deduced the α values for CaO from those
of MgO. This procedure is justiﬁed because the cation
size does not change appreciably with coordination num-
ber. For the calcium cation we take the bulk polarizabil-
ity (3.193 a.u.)45

We close this section with a consideration of several
criticisms that could be raised against (and of the ad-
vantages of) the employed methodology. We have cho-
sen a mixed ab initio/semiempirical energy model in or-
der to obtain a good compromise between computational
eﬃciency and accuracy. All the relevant energy terms
excluding polarization are described with an ab initio
methodology. To include polarization, we have used an
accurate model,43 where the parameters have been ﬁtted
by a comparison to ab initio calculations.19 Special care
has been devoted to the separation of all the indepen-
dent physical factors that inﬂuence a given quantity, thus
avoiding a mixing of diﬀerent eﬀects in a single parameter
and enhancing the transferability of the model. The good
parameterisation is reﬂected in the fact that parameters
can be transfered between closely related systems (like,
for example, diﬀerent metal oxides) by simple scaling ar-
guments involving ionic radii.46 Thus, we think that the
reliability of our calculations is reduced just a little com-
pared to full ab initio methodologies. To support this
expectation, we made a comparison with DMOL calcu-
lations performed on neutral (CaO)n clusters by Malli-
avin and Coudray.24 All the interionic distances were
in agreement to their calculations up to diﬀerences of 4
%. The energetic ordering of the isomers, as well as the
speciﬁc energy diﬀerences, are reproduced with a maxi-
mum error of 5 %. We believe that this is a very rea-
sonable agreement, even more if we realize that we are
neglecting dispersion interactions, and polarization in-
teractions beyond the dipolar terms. The solid MgO is
excellently described with the aiPI model (at least in its
static properties).47 The model is then expected to trans-
fer properly between both limits. The larger computa-
tional simplicity has been exploited to study large cluster
sizes (up to 59 ions) with full relaxations of the geome-
tries. Moreover, for each cluster size, a large number
of isomers (between 10 and 15) have been investigated.
The generation of the initial cluster geometries was ac-
complished by using a pair potential, as we explained in
our previous publication.27 The optimization of the ge-
ometries has been performed by using a downhill simplex
algorithm.48,49

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Structural Trends in (CaO)nCa2+ Cluster Ions

In Fig.1 we present the optimized aiPI+polarization
structures of the ground state (GS) and lowest lying iso-
mers or (CaO)nCa2+ (n=4–29) cluster ions. Below each
isomer we show the energy diﬀerence (in eV) with re-
spect to the ground state. For n<4, the clusters are not
detected in the experiments, probably because they un-
dergo a Coulomb explosion driven by the excess charge
and the small cluster size, but we are not interested here
in this aspect of the experiments. From n=4 to n=10,
there is a predominance of n×2×2 fragments (n=2–5),
that is, the (CaO)2 subunit appears as the basic building
block. The total number of ions in these nonstoichiomet-
ric clusters is an odd number, and thus those structures
are never perfectly compact. There is either an extra
cation added to or a missing anion removed from the
perfect structure. Less compact structures as for example
planar fragments are not energetically competitive. The
structures in this size range tend to be elongated as a di-
rect consequence of the excess cluster charge. When n=9,
a 3×3×2+1 fragment is more stable than that based on
the (CaO)2 building block, and n=10 is the largest clus-
ter size for which a fragment of this kind is the ground
state. Another thing to be pointed out is that in this size
range, the extra cation present in the n×2×2+1 struc-
tures induces a larger cluster distortion than the missing
anion in the n×2×2-1 structures. We will see that this
feature has important implications in the stability of the
clusters.

From n=11 to n=15, the dominant fragments are based
on n×3×2 units. For n=16 and 17, the most stable iso-
mers are n×4×2 fragments. None of these structures has
still developed an anion with full bulk coordination. In
particular, the 3×3×3 isomer for n=13, which is particu-
larly stable in the case of nonstoichiometric alkali halide
cluster ions,30 does not even appear in Fig. 1. The large
coordination-dependent values of the polarizabilities of
the oxide anions favors the formation of surface sites,
and gives rise to somewhat less compact ground state
structures, for which the increase in dipolar energy com-
pensate for the decrease in Madelung energy. The 3×3×3
(CaO)13Ca2+ is specially unfavored by the dipolar energy
terms because it has a central oxide anion with bulk co-
ordination (so with a comparatively low polarizability),
and another 12 anions with coordination 4. On the con-
trary, the largest coordination in the GS structure is ﬁve,
and some three-coordinated anions (in corner positions)
also appear, inducing a large dipolar energy stabilization.
For n=18 and 19 there is a glimpse of a transition to more
compact cluster structures. The important feature of the
GS structures of these two cluster sizes, compared to the
3×3×3 for n=13, is that now there are oxide anions in
corner positions. These make a large contribution to the
polarization energy term, that added to the increased
Madelung energy of a compact fragment, gives a total
GS energy more negative than that of n×3×2 or n×4×2
structures. Nevertheless, the energy diﬀerences between
isomers are small, and from n=20 on, ground state iso-

mers without bulk anions are again obtained (n=24 and
27 are the only relevant exceptions, because the ground
states of n=26 and n=29 can be considered degenerate
within the accuracy of our theoretical model).

A general feature of (CaO)nCa2+ cluster ions with n≥8
is that a×b×c+1 fragments are specially stable compared
to other isomers whenever they can be formed. In Ta-
ble I we show all the fragments of that kind relevant to
the cluster size range considered in this study. Each se-
ries has a typical periodicity that could in principle be
reﬂected in diﬀerent portions of the mass spectra, given
the high stability of these fragments. Some sizes can be
accomodated in several families, that is, the classiﬁcation
is highly redundant, but useful anyway to our purposes.
If for a given cluster size, a cluster with that formula can
be formed, it is always the ground state structure. If it
is possible to build up two diﬀerent isomers with that
formula (n=12, 18, 24), the more compact structure is
energetically favored. This rule works as long as we do
not consider structures that are not energetically compet-
itive anymore (the isomer based on the (CaO)2 building
block of (CaO)14Ca2+ is an example), and can be helpful
in guessing specially stable structures for clusters larger
than those studied here. For nearly all those cluster sizes
with no competitive a×b×c+1 structure, a×b×c-1 frag-
ments are obtained as the ground state or specially stable
isomers (examples are found for n=5, 7, 11, 19, 23 and
29). The special stability of a×b×c+1 structures is some-
times reﬂected in high stabilities for the corresponding
a×b×c+3 structures, comparable indeed to the stabili-
ties of a×b×c-1 fragments; this occurs for n=13, 17, 19
and 26. With the only exceptions of n=13,14,22,26 and
29, all (CaO)nCa2+ GS structures are explained in terms
of those three kinds of fragments.

Comparing to the results of our previous paper on
(MgO)nMg2+ cluster ions,27 we can see that from n=4
to n=20 the GS structures are basically the same in both
systems (the only exceptions are n=7 and n=13). Inter-
esting structural diﬀerences between both materials ap-
pear in the size range n>20. Speciﬁcally, the transition
to bulklike structures, containing inner anions with bulk
coordination, is slower in the case of (CaO)nCa2+. An
analysis of the several energy components shows that the
net eﬀect of polarization is more important in calcium
oxide. Although the polarizability of Ca2+ is larger than
that of Mg2+ and the coordination-dependent values of
α(O2−) are larger in CaO than in MgO, this is not a triv-
ial conclusion, because the interatomic distances are also
larger in CaO, and so the electric ﬁelds acting on each ion
are correspondingly smaller. If we consider that a highly
ionic material is that one for which the Madelung en-
ergy term is almost completely dominant in determining
structural and several other properties, we would con-
clude that the ionic character of (CaO)nCa2+ is smaller
that that found for (MgO)nMg2+. Indeed, being the po-
larization contribution more important, the structures of
calcium oxide clusters have a larger directionality degree,
a feature that is usually associated to covalency (opposite
to the natural tendency of purely ionic systems to form
isotropic structures). However, we think that the term
“covalency” should be employed just in those situations

4

where charge transfer between diﬀerent atomic centers is
important. As Madden and coworkers have discussed,41
polarization terms in ionic systems are responsible for a
lot of properties traditionally attributed to “covalency”.
One point that deserves further investigation, however,
is whether the directional properties induced by polar-
ization eﬀects (and reﬂected in a lower average coordi-
nation) can be responsible for a larger charge transfer
between diﬀerent centers. This would be reasonable be-
cause the saturation of the bonds is less complete.

B. Relative stabilities and connection to

experimental mass spectra

In the experimental mass spectra,11,15 the populations
observed for some cluster sizes are enhanced over those of
the neighboring sizes. These socalled “magic numbers”
are a consequence of the evaporation events that occur in
the cluster beam, mostly after ionization.50 A magic clus-
ter of size n has an evaporation energy that is large com-
pared to that of the neighboring sizes (n-1) and (n+1).
Thus, on the average, clusters of size n undergo a smaller
number of evaporation events and this leads to the max-
ima in the mass spectra. As our main concern in this sec-
tion is to compare with the experimental mass spectra,
we calculate the evaporation energy as a function of clus-
ter size. To do this, we assume that the dominant evap-
oration channel is the loss of a neutral (CaO) molecule,
something supported by the experiments of Ziemann and
Castleman.15 In the size range n<11, some other chanels
seem to be opened in the experiments,15 and indeed for
n<4 Coulomb explosion is dominant, that is the reason
why we do not consider clusters with n<4. With that as-
sumption, the evaporation energy of (CaO)nCa2+ reads

Eevap(n) = Ecluster[(CaO)n−1Ca2+] + E(CaO)
−Ecluster[(CaO)nCa2+].

(9)

Maxima in the evaporation energy curve do not al-
ways coincide with maxima in the experimental mass
spectra.27 There are two main processes that contribute
to enhance the cluster population for size n: a)A small
evaporation energy for size (n+1); b)A large evaporation
energy for size n. Thus, a most convenient quantity to
compare with experiment is the second energy diﬀerence

∆2(n) = Eevap(n + 1) − Eevap(n).

(10)

A negative value of ∆2(n) indicates that the n-population
increases by evaporations from the (n+1)–clusters more
rapidly than it decays by evaporation to the (n-1)–
clusters. Speciﬁcally, the specially stable cluster sizes
will be reﬂected as minima in the ∆2(n) curve.

Now, the evaporation energy Eevap(n) of eq. (9) can
In the ﬁrst one,
be calculated in two diﬀerent ways.
energy diﬀerences are always taken between the ground
state structures of sizes n and (n-1). This procedure,
which we call (by obvious reasons) adiabatic evapora-
tion, reﬂects the stability of the clusters in the limit of
small energy barriers between isomers or alternatively of
large experimental times of ﬂight. The stabilities calcu-
lated in this way are shown in the upper part of ﬁgure

2. Magic numbers are found for n=5,8,12,15,18,20,24,27.
The only a×b×c-1 structure that shows a special stabil-
ity is that of n=5. The rest of magic clusters belong to
the a×b×c+1 family of structures. If n is a magic size,
and both (n+1) and (n-1) GS structures do not belong
to the a×b×c+1 family, a deep minima is found in the
∆2(n) curve (this happens for n=12 and 18). For the
rest of magic sizes, the (n+1) GS structure has also the
formula a×b×c+1, and has a correspondingly high sta-
bility reﬂected in a negative value of ∆2(n + 1). In these
cases the stability of size n is just slightly enhanced over
that of size (n+1). One can appreciate the increasing rel-
evance of the Madelung term in determining the cluster
stabilities: when n<20, the most stable a×b×c+1 struc-
tures are the less compact ones (n=8 and 15 more stable
than n=9 and 16, respectively); if n≥20, that trend is
reversed (n=20, 24 and 27 more stable than n= 21, 25,
and 28, respectively). The special relevance of a×b×c+1
structures in explaining the cluster stabilities does not
conform to the initial experimental expectations of high
stabilities for a×b×c-1 structures.15 Analysing the en-
ergy components, we ﬁnd that the polarization contri-
bution stabilizes the a×b×c+1 structure more than the
corresponding a×b×c-1 structure for all values of a,b,c.
For the smallest cluster sizes, however, the extra cation
present in a×b×c+1 structures induces a large cluster
distortion compared to that induced by the missing anion
in a×b×c-1 structures, and the Madelung contribution
favors these last structures in a larger amount, making
them more stable for some sizes.

The second kind of calculation of Eevap(n) proceeds
as follows: we consider the optimized GS structure
of (CaO)nCa2+ and identify the CaO molecule that
contributes the least to the cluster binding energy.
Then we remove that molecule and relax the resulting
(CaO)n−1Ca2+ fragment to the nearest local minimum.
This process can be termed locally adiabatic because
both fragments are allowed to relax to the local min-
imum energy conﬁguration after the evaporation. For
some cluster sizes, the fragment of size (n-1) left when
a CaO molecule is removed from (CaO)nCa2+ does not
lie on the catchment basin of the (CaO)n−1Ca2+ GS iso-
mer, so that the locally adiabatic evaporation energies
are larger than the energy diﬀerences between adjacent
ground states minus E(CaO) in those cases. The locally
adiabatic evaporation energies are plotted as a function
of n in the lower part of Fig. 2. These will reﬂect the clus-
ter stabilities in the limit of large energy barriers between
isomers or of short experimental times of ﬂight. Magic
numbers are obtained for n=5,7,9,11,13,16,19,22,25 and
27, in complete agreement with the experiments of Zie-
mann and Castleman.15

The main message to be extracted from these consider-
ations is that the magic numbers obtained in the experi-
ments might be dominated by the eﬀects of kinetic traps
occuring in the course of the evaporation process. Being
our calculations static, we can not rigorously assert that
this is the only possible explanation, but a plausibility
argument based on a comparison to the closely related
and more thoroughly studied case of alkali halides sup-
ports our expectations. The mobility experiments per-

5

formed by the group of Jarrold5,6 show that the relax-
ation dynamics to the ground state structure for sodium
chloride clusters involves drift times of almost one sec-
ond. The importance of kinetic traps in explaining these
interesting results is shown in the theoretical works of
Doye and Wales.51 Speciﬁcally, these authors show that
the potential energy landscape of alkali halide clusters,
calculated by using a phenomenological pair potential to
describe the interactions, is structured in several funnels,
separated from each other by high free-energy barriers.
When a cluster evaporates a molecule, it cools in the
process, so trapping kinetic eﬀects are expected when-
ever parent and product GS structures belong to diﬀerent
funnels. Given the close similarities between halide and
oxide systems, one expects similar eﬀects in the evap-
oration kinetics of alkaline-earth oxides to be relevant.
The main structural diﬀerences are due to the eﬀects of
polarization, and these could also aﬀect the mechanisms
of structural transitions.
In the case of alkali halides,
Doye and Wales ﬁnd that a highly cooperative process
is energetically less impeded by energy barriers than se-
quential ionic diﬀusion,51 with interesting implications
for the mechanical properties of these clusters. Perhaps
the same is true for the clusters studied here, but one
has to keep in mind that polarization tends to lower the
barriers against diﬀusion,52 and those eﬀects are more
important for oxides. We think that further calculations
of this kind for oxide clusters would be very interesting.
Mobility experiments on (MgO)nMg2+ or (CaO)nCa2+
could conclusively conﬁrm the structural trends found in
the present work.

C. Neutral Stoichiometric (MgO)n and (CaO)n

clusters

n and (CaO)+

The experiments performed by Saunders9,10 show that
both (MgO)+
n stoichiometric cluster ions
with a number of molecules n=6,9,12 and 15 are expe-
cially abundant in the mass spectra. However, when
these clusters are allowed to collide with inert gas
ions, the fragmentation channels are diﬀerent: (MgO)3
fragments are predominantly observed in one case and
(CaO)2 fragments in the other. These results suggest
that the basic cluster building blocks are diﬀerent for the
two materials, but not so diﬀerent as to lead to diﬀerent
magic numbers.

We found a similar scenario in the case of alkali halide
clusters.29 Speciﬁcally, a universal set of magic numbers
n=4,6,9,12,... was found for the whole family of (AX)n
clusters, with A=Li,Na,K,Rb and X=F,Cl,Br,I. However,
the cluster structures were not found to be the same
for all the diﬀerent materials. When the cation size is
much smaller than the anion size (all lithium halides and
sodium iodide),28 ground state structures based on the
stacking of hexagonal (AX)3 rings are obtained. For
the rest of materials, the ground state structures are
mostly obtained by stacking of rectangular (or double-
chain) (AX)3 planar fragments. This is just a packing ef-
fect: when the ratio of cation to anion size is very small,
anion-anion overlap repulsive interactions are large, forc-
ing an opening of the (AX)3 rectangular fragments into

hexagons. The magic numbers are the same for both
structural families because it is for those cluster sizes that
specially compact structures can be formed. When we
studied (AX)nA+ alkali halide cluster ions,30 we found
that the structures were much more similar irrespective
of packing considerations. The ring structures are not
competitive in this case because it is not possible to build
up a perfect hexagonal fragment with an odd number of
ions. On the contrary, perfect cubic structures can be
formed (as for example the 3×3×3 structure for n=13).
From our study on doubly-charged clusters, we have
not
found important structural diﬀerences between
(CaO)nCa2+ and (MgO)nMg2+,27 at least in the small
size regime. We have performed aiPI+polarization cal-
culations on the structures of (MgO)n and (CaO)n with
n=3,6,9,12,15 and 18. Speciﬁcally, we have considered
just those structures based on staking of hexagonal and
rectangular (AO)3 units, and those based on stacking of
(AO)2 units, with A=Mg or Ca. We ﬁnd that the ground
state structures of (MgO)n clusters are based on (MgO)3
units, while those of (CaO)n clusters have a rectangular
(CaO)3 building block, being this the same packing ef-
fect found in the case of alkali halides. The structure of
(CaO)6 could be alternatively viewed as the stacking of
three (CaO)2 units, but for n=9,12,15 and 18, the tubu-
lar shapes obtained by stacking (CaO)2 units are not
competitive anymore. Were all the ground state struc-
tures of (CaO)n clusters based on the (CaO)2 building
block, we would expect a periodicity of 2 in the magic
numbers observed in the mass spectra. Saunders shows
the collision induced fragmentation spectra of (CaO)n,
with n=4,6,8,9 which are certainly based on stacking of
(CaO)2 units, but does not show those for (CaO)9 or
(CaO)12, for example. Our main conclusion is that the
special stability of (CaO)n clusters is also explained in
terms of (CaO)3 units, but with rectangular instead of
hexagonal shape. This explains the same periodicities
observed in the magic numbers of both materials.

IV. SUMMARY

The ab initio perturbed ion model, supplemented with
a parameterised treatment of dipolar terms, has been
employed in order to study the structural and energetic
properties of (CaO)nCa2+ (n=1–29) cluster ions. Po-
larization eﬀects favor the formation of surface sites, and
reduce the stability of highly compact structures contain-
ing anions with bulk coordination. Thus, despite many
similarities in the experimental mass spectra, the struc-
tures of alkaline-earth oxide and alkali halide cluster ions
are shown to be diﬀerent. Most of the lowest energy
structures have the formula a×b×c+1. The structures
of (CaO)nCa2+ and (MgO)nMg2+ cluster ions are very
similar for n<20, irrespective of diﬀerences in cationic
size and polarization. It is just for n≥20 that structural
diﬀerences emerge, showing a slower convergence to bulk
properties for CaO compared to MgO. The analysis of
the stabilities suggests that the experimental mass spec-
tra could be dominated by the eﬀects of kinetic traps.
Speciﬁcally, if we consider locally adiabatic evaporation

6

events, complete agreement is found with the experi-
mental stabilities. The neutral stoichiometric (MgO)n
and (CaO)n clusters (n=3,6,9,12,15,18) show structural
diﬀerences similar to those observed in neutral stoichio-
metric alkali halide clusters: the basic building block is
an (MgO)3 hexagonal fragment in the case of MgO and
a (CaO)3 rectangular (or double-chain) fragment in the
case of CaO. This is just a packing eﬀect due to the
larger overlap repulsion between anions when the cation
size is very small. While the structures of (CaO)n clus-
ters, with n=4,6,8 are certainly based on (CaO)2 units,
as suggested by collision-induced fragmentation experi-
ments, the specially stable (CaO)n clusters are based on
a (CaO)3 unit. This explains the same periodicity of
3 observed in the experimental magic numbers of both
(MgO)+

3 and (CaO)+

3 clusters.

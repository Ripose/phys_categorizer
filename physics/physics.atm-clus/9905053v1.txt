Abstract

By extending the concept of Euler-angle rotations to more than three di-

mensions, we develop the systematics under rotations in higher-dimensional

space for a novel set of hyperspherical harmonics. Applying this formalism,

we determine all pairwise Coulomb interactions in a few-body system with-

out recourse to multipole expansions. Our approach combines the advantages

of relative coordinates with those of the hyperspherical description. In the

present method, each Coulomb matrix element reduces to the “1/r” form fa-

miliar from the two-body problem. Consequently, our calculation accounts

for all the cusps in the wave function whenever an inter-particle separation

vanishes. Unlike a truncated multipole expansion, the calculation presented

here is exact. Following the systematic development of the procedure for an

arbitrary number of particles, we demonstrate it explicitly with the simplest

non-trivial example, the three-body system.

I. INTRODUCTION

A system consisting of N charged particles gives rise to N(N − 1)/2 pairwise Coulomb

interaction terms in its Hamiltonian. Since only the two-body problem (N = 2) can actually

be solved exactly, conventional atomic physics methods view the complete system of particles

at the outset as a conglomerate of independent two-body systems, adding the interactions

between these independent particles in a second step. This approach amounts to selecting

a suitable subset of the N(N − 1)/2 Coulomb terms for which a solution in terms of “si-

multaneous two-body wave functions” can be given. For instance, the independent-particle

model for atomic systems treats each electron as interacting primarily with the nucleus (or

with the ionic core in the case of valence electrons). Each (valence) electron’s position intro-

duces an independent spherical direction. Just as in the familiar solution of the hydrogen

atom, each electron contributes to the angular part of the total system’s wave function a

spherical harmonic Ylm of the angles specifying its direction in space. In the next step, all

the electron-electron interactions are calculated by expanding the corresponding separations

into Legendre polynomials of the inter-electronic angles, thus yielding the familiar multipole

expansion. In more general terms, the independent-particle model ﬁrst selects a speciﬁc par-

ticle #1 (on physical grounds, typically the nucleus or the ionic core) and solves for each of

the remaining N − 1 particles the two-body problem {1, j}, j = 2, . . . , N, thereby providing

a basis for expanding the total wave function. In the next step, the interaction between

particles i and j is calculated by adapting the reciprocal of their separation, 1/rij, to the

coordinate system pertaining to the “two-body” basis functions for i and j (i, j = 2, . . . , N).

The Coulomb interaction is singular whenever an inter-particle separation vanishes. Since

these singularities are isolated from one another, they do not pose fundamental diﬃculties

in calculating the Hamiltonian matrix. However, they give rise to cusps (discontinuous

derivatives) in the wave function [1], thus slowing down the convergence of partial-wave

expansions of the wave function in their vicinity [2,3]. The independent-particle wave func-

tions can only account (through the corresponding s-wave components) for the cusps arising

2

from vanishing separations r1j, j = 2, . . . , N. Cusps due to vanishing rij with i 6= 1 are not

reproduced. Possible remedies to these shortcomings include the explicit use of coordinates

like the inter-electronic angle θij or even rij besides ri and rj; various approximations for

1/rij [4]; or replacing ri, rj by r< = min(ri, rj), r> = max(ri, rj) in the Hamiltonian [5]. All

these approaches amount to adapting the interaction operator 1/rij to a single coordinate

system.

The present investigation explores the alternative approach of adapting the basis func-

tions to match the relevant inter-particle separations rij by utilizing several coordinate sys-

tems simultaneously. We calculate a speciﬁc interaction term ∼ 1/rij in the coordinate

system best suited for this particular purpose. Thus, the particle separations rij dictate the

choice of coordinate systems, the wave functions being transformed between the relevant

reference frames to evaluate the diﬀerent terms of the Hamiltonian. The success of this

approach hinges on our ability to perform the numerous transformations between reference

frames with high eﬃciency. Sec. II describes hyperspherical Jacobi coordinates appropriate

for this task. Sec. III provides the main results by implementing the relevant transforma-

tions for a system with an arbitrary number of particles and by constructing basis functions

(harmonics) suitable for extensive transformation between reference frames. The resulting

set of hyperspherical harmonics, derived here in the context of calculating the Hamiltonian

matrix for a system of N charged particles, has in fact much wider applicability.

Hyperspherical coordinates and corresponding hyperspherical harmonics have been ap-

plied in various areas of physics since the 1950s, for instance, in three-body scattering [6–8],

nuclear [9,10] and atomic [11–19] physics, as well as in quantum chemistry [20,21]. However,

the sets of functions introduced in the present investigation are equivalent to, but much

more ﬂexible than, the hyperspherical harmonics discussed in [6–21]. Beyond constituting a

complete orthogonal set of functions appropriate for expansions, their frame-independence

aﬀords greater ﬂexibility in analyzing selection rules and other relations between harmonics.

These aspects are conveniently investigated through ladder operators; they are determined

entirely by the symmetry properties of the N-particle system, independent of any coordinate

3

representation. Only calculating the non-vanishing matrix elements requires an appropri-

ate coordinate representation of the generic basis functions. Sec. IV illustrates the relevant

procedures with the simplest non-trivial example, the three-body problem. The conclud-

ing Sec. V discusses advantages and limitations of the new technique, as compared to the

conventional multipole expansion.

II. HYPERSPHERICAL JACOBI COORDINATES

The inverse proportionality between pairwise interaction and inter-particle separation

suggests replacing individual particles’ positions with relative (Jacobi) coordinates. Starting

from one pair of particles, the construction of Jacobi coordinates proceeds hierarchically by

joining (the centers of mass of) increasingly complex groups of particles. This hierarchical

structure is commonly referred to as a “Jacobi tree” [10]. Alternative choices for the initial

particle pair, as well as the ordering of successive particle groups, correspond to diﬀerent

Jacobi trees.

In the next step, mass-scaling of the Jacobi coordinates fully exposes the

symmetry of the kinetic energy operator for the multi-particle system. Let p, q denote two

(groups of) particles with masses Mp, Mq and center of mass positions rp and rq, respectively.

Appropriate mass-scaling of the relative coordinate in the form [8] ξp,q = {MpMq/(Mp +

Mq)}1/2(rp −rq) removes the individual mass dependence from the expression for the kinetic

energy:

Xi=1

¯h2

N −1

Xk=1

¯h2
2Mtot

∆ri = −

∆ξk −

∆rCM.

(2.1)

Setting the origin at the center of mass of the whole system allows discarding the CM’s posi-

tion and motion. With the individual mass factors removed, the kinetic energy (generalized

Laplacian) displays complete symmetry under rotations in (3N − 3)-dimensional space.

Hyperspherical coordinates exploit this symmetry by separating the “shape” of the sys-

tem (described by 3N − 4 angular coordinates) from its overall “size” R2 =

k ξ2

k (with

the dimension of a moment of inertia). Eigenfunctions of the Laplacian’s angular part,

P

4

termed “hyperspherical harmonics” by generalizing the two- and three-dimensional cases,

constitute a basis for expanding the complete wave function. In higher-dimensional spaces,

the angular Laplacian’s eigenvalues Λ(Λ + 3N − 5) are highly degenerate. In addition to

the “grand angular momentum” Λ [8], the hyperspherical harmonics thus require numer-

ous labels—analogues of the single “magnetic” quantum number m for three-dimensional

spherical harmonics—for their unique speciﬁcation. Diﬀerent sets of hyperspherical harmon-

ics, resulting from solving the Laplacian eigenvalue problem by separation of variables in

alternative sets of coordinates, have been investigated extensively (see, e.g., [10,17,21] for

systematic studies). However, their construction through separation of variables inevitably

ties these harmonics to a speciﬁc coordinate system. They are thus not well suited for exten-

sive transformation between diﬀerent reference frames. The deﬁnition of harmonics based

only on their behavior under the relevant transformations is the main result of this paper,

to be derived in Sec. III.

The construction of each Jacobi tree starts with a pair of particles. Thus, each Jacobi

tree contains at least one Jacobi vector joining two particles only (rather than centers of

mass of particle groups). We denote such a vector as a “primary” coordinate. In any one

Jacobi tree, up to ⌊N/2⌋ Jacobi vectors are directly proportional to actual inter-particle

separations, rij, the remaining relative coordinates necessarily involving larger complexes of

particles. (Here and in the following, ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer not exceeding x.) We

will calculate each of the N(N − 1)/2 Coulomb terms of the Hamiltonian in a Jacobi tree

where it occurs as a “primary” coordinate. Obviously, all these terms then take the same

form as the simple one-electron integral over 1/r in hydrogen, but the variables now refer

to a multitude of diﬀerent reference frames. Having thus eliminated all nested integrations,

our next task consists in determining the transformations between diﬀerent Jacobi trees.

The most general transformation from one Jacobi tree to another (for the same system of

particles) resolves into a sequence of elementary operations. Each elementary step consists

in “transplanting” a sub-complex q from some particle complex {pq} to a complex {qr} [10];

it is achieved by a two-dimensional kinematic rotation [8] through the angle

φ = tan−1

in the (ξp,q, ξpq,r)-plane of the (N − 1)-dimensional space of mass-scaled Jacobi vectors:

ξ′
q,r = cos φ ξp,q − sin φ ξpq,r

ξ′
p,qr = sin φ ξp,q + cos φ ξpq,r.

(2.3a)

(2.3b)

As each Jacobi vector is a vector in three-dimensional physical space, the basic rotation

in the (ξj, ξk)-plane implies three rotations through the same angle φ in the (xj, xk)-, the

(yj, yk)-, and the (zj, zk)-planes, where (x, y, z) denote the Cartesian components of ξ. An

elementary kinematic rotation through a ﬁnite angle φ in the (ξj, ξk)-plane then reads [22]

Tξj ,ξk(φ) = exp(iφJxjxk) exp(iφJyj yk) exp(iφJzjzk),

(2.4)

,

(u, v) = (xj, xk), (yj, yk), (zj, zk).

(2.5)

(For a heuristic explanation of (2.4), recall the Taylor expansion of f (x + ∆x) which may

formally be written as exp(i∆x p) f (x) with the inﬁnitesimal “translation operator” p ≡

−i ∂

∂x corresponding to the quantum mechanical linear momentum (with ¯h ≡ 1).

In the

present context, the translation from x to x + ∆x is replaced by a rotation through an angle

φ from some direction in multi-dimensional space to a new direction.) In order to determine

Tξj,ξk ’s eﬀect on the basis functions, we need to (i) express the generic rotation operators

Juv in terms of “ladder operators” whose action on the basis functions is straightforward to

calculate, and (ii) construct basis functions suitable for such transformations.

This section concludes with the outline of a strategy for determining the most eﬃcient se-

quence of two-dimensional rotations to achieve the transformation between arbitrary Jacobi

trees. Note ﬁrst that the individual terms in the Hamiltonian are referred to by means of

particle labels, implying the need for appropriate antisymmetrization of the total wave func-

tion under interchange of identical particles. This consideration dominates the construction

6

of the ﬁrst Jacobi tree to which all subsequent transformations are applied. In an atomic

or molecular system, antisymmetrization concerns primarily the electronic part of the wave

function. Thus the basic Jacobi tree starts out with a pair of electrons. It grows by adding

one electron at a time, ﬁnishing with the addition of nuclei or ionic core(s). This procedure

results in a “canonical” Jacobi tree [10], represented by the sequence of particle labels

(· · · ((((12)3)4)5) . . .),

(2.6)

whose parentheses separate sub-complexes. Alternatively, one could start by ﬁrst forming

as many pairs of particles as possible, i.e., ⌊N/2⌋ pairs, before joining these pairs into larger

complexes. Although the antisymmetrization of an electron pair is particularly compact

(namely, their relative angular momentum and their spin must add to an even value), anti-

symmetrization among diﬀerent pairs requires breaking up all these pairs, in essence going

back to a canonical tree. Since breaking up sub-complexes involves about as many elemen-

tary rotations as forming the new complexes, this procedure is not eﬃcient. Nevertheless, a

set of N (for odd particle number) or N − 1 (even particle number) trees with the maximum

number of ⌊N/2⌋ pairs suﬃces to isolate all the N(N − 1)/2 inter-particle separations. A

successful strategy therefore aims at building these particular Jacobi trees from the canonical

tree. The simplest of these “pair-trees”, (· · · ((12)(34))(56) . . .), is obtained from the canon-

ical tree with only ⌊N/2⌋ − 1 rotations. In general, the pair (jk) with j < k is (k − j − δj,1)

rotations away from the canonical tree, but many other “useful” pairs are formed in the

course of these “transplantations”.

III. TRANSFORMING THE BASIS FUNCTIONS

This section provides the tools required to rotate harmonics from one coordinate sys-

tem to another. Our transformation matrices are analogous to the so-called Raynal-Revai

coeﬃcients [23]. The reader familiar with Lie algebra will of course recognize the relevant

aspects of so(3N − 3), the algebra of rotations in (3N − 3) dimensional space. However,

7

such familiarity is not presumed, and we hardly use the terminology of group theory. Our

presentation reﬂects a more pragmatic point of view, emphasizing both the technical im-

plementation as well as its relation to the physical application at hand rather than full

mathematical generality. For the latter aspects, the reader should turn to the mathematical

literature [24].

A. Rotations in d-dimensional space

The most intuitive description of a rotation in three dimensions requires two elements:

the (invariant) axis, and the angle of rotation. The rotation itself occurs in a plane perpen-

dicular to the axis of rotation. In three dimensions, specifying the direction of the axis of

rotation is equivalent to, but more economical than, describing the actual plane of rotation.

For a higher dimensional space this is no longer the case, because there are several invariant

directions perpendicular to a given plane. Thus, in d-dimensional space, a basic rotation is

more appropriately characterized as occurring in the plane spanned by two coordinates rather

than by an invariant axis orthogonal to it. The generic inﬁnitesimal rotation operators then

take the form (2.5). The number of diﬀerent planes, 1

2d(d − 1) in d dimensions, equals the

number of basic rotations. Because rotations occurring in non-intersecting planes aﬀect dif-

ferent pairs of coordinates, they are evidently independent of each other; the corresponding

rotation operators commute with one another. As there are ⌊d/2⌋ non-intersecting planes in

a d-dimensional space, the largest set of simultaneously commuting operators Juv contains

ℓ ≡ ⌊d/2⌋ elements. These commuting operators are commonly denoted as Hj, j = 1, . . . , ℓ

[24]. For our application, the power of the Lie algebraic method derives from the structure

and the properties of rotations being completely independent of any particular coordinate

representation of the operators Hj. In fact, the following manipulations are most eﬃciently

carried out in generic Cartesian coordinates without any reference to a speciﬁc Jacobi tree.

Simultaneous eigenfunctions of the Hj with (integer) eigenvalues mj, j = 1, . . . , ℓ, provide

a basis for building hyperspherical harmonics suitable for extensive rotations between refer-

8

ence frames. If the inﬁnitesimal rotation corresponding to Hj occurs in the (uj, vj)-plane,

the simultaneous eigenfunction of the ℓ Hj with eigenvalues mj, respectively, reads

F ({uk, vk}) ×

(uj + i vj)mj

(3.1)

ℓ

Yj=1

with a function F that bears further speciﬁcation in Subsect. III C. At this point, we only

require that Hj F ≡ 0 for all j. The set of eigenvalues µ = {m1, m2, . . . , mℓ} serves as a

label identifying diﬀerent harmonics with the same value of Λ(Λ + d − 2) in the angular

Laplacian’s eigenvalue equation. Additional labels required for a unique speciﬁcation will

be introduced in Subsect. III C.

ladder operators Eα satisfying

Appropriate linear combinations of the remaining inﬁnitesimal rotation operators act as

[Hj, Eα] = αj Eα,

j = 1, . . . , ℓ,

(3.2)

with an ℓ-dimensional vector index α with components αj = 0, ±1. Here αj = 0 indicates

that Eα does not change the part of the eigenfunction pertaining to Hj, whereas αj = ±1

means that it maps this part to the eigenfunction with eigenvalue mj ± 1. The ladder

operators interrelate eigenfunctions with diﬀerent µ but degenerate Λ. Raising and lowering

operators form Hermitian conjugate pairs E−α = E†
α.

In general (for ℓ > 1), each ladder operator aﬀects two of the mj simultaneously; for

odd-dimensional spaces a subset of ℓ pairs of raising and lowering operators change one of

the mj only [24]. Abbreviating the vector label α by giving only its two non-vanishing

components αj and αk, the ladder operator that raises mj and simultaneously lowers mk

takes the form

E+−

jk = −

(uj + i vj)

∂
∂(uk + i vk)

− (uk − i vk)

∂
∂(uj − i vj) !

whereas the operator raising both mj and mk is represented by

∂(uj − i vj) !

(Straightforward application of these operators to eigenfunctions (3.1) veriﬁes their behaving

as ladder operators: they contribute to, or remove from, (3.1) factors (uj ±ivj) and (uk ±ivk)

as appropriate for the intended “ladder operator action”.) For odd-dimensional spaces, a

residual coordinate, denoted here by w, does not occur in any of the Hj. The ladder operators

changing only mj (rather than a pair mj, mk) read then

(3.3c)

(For d = 3, setting (u, v, w) = (x, y, z) and transforming the derivatives reveals the familiar

pair of ladder operators lx ± i ly, the single Hj occurring in this case coinciding with lz.)

This symbolic representation allows for eﬃcient implementation on the computer.

A subset of ℓ ladder operators Eǫj (and their Hermitian conjugates) suﬃces to interrelate

all harmonics with the same eigenvalue Λ. A convenient choice [24] for these Eǫj is given

by the ladder operators that raise mj and simultaneously lower mj+1 for j = 1, . . . , ℓ − 1.

Eǫℓ’s form depends on whether d is even or odd. For d even, Eǫℓ raises both mℓ−1 and

mℓ, and for odd d, it raises mℓ only, without changing any of the other mj. The set {ǫj},

j = 1, . . . , ℓ, then provides a basis for the ℓ-dimensional space of the vector labels α and µ.

In an ℓ-component vector notation, this basis reads (we assume ℓ ≥ 5 in order to expose the

generic structure clearly)

ǫ1 = (1, −1, 0, 0, . . . , 0)

ǫ2 = (0, 1, −1, 0, . . . , 0)

ǫ3 = (0, 0, 1, −1, . . . , 0)

ǫℓ−1 = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1, −1)

...

ǫℓ = 


(3.4)

(0, 0, . . . , 0, 1, 1)

for d = 2ℓ

(0, 0, . . . , 0, 0, 1)

for d = 2ℓ + 1.

In general these basis vectors are not orthogonal in ℓ-dimensional space. Note, however, the

following special cases: (i) In four-dimensional space (with ℓ = 2), the two basis vectors ǫ1 =

(1, −1) and ǫ2 = (1, 1) are orthogonal, indicating that the two basic ladder operator pairs,

E±ǫ1 and E±ǫ2, commute with each other. In group theoretical language, this feature reﬂects

the direct product structure SO(4) = SO(3) ⊗ SO(3). However, the two SO(3)-components

do not refer to m1 and m2 directly, but rather to (m1 − m2)/2 and (m1 + m2)/2. (ii) For

rotations in three-dimensional space, we have ℓ = 1, thus only one quantum number m which

is being changed by one pair of ladder operators E±ǫ1 ≡ l±. (iii) In d = 2 dimensions, there

are no ladder operators. Since all rotations occur in the same plane (the “only” plane of

two-dimensional space), the order in which rotations through diﬀerent angles are performed

does not matter; they are all independent of each other. In the present formulation, the

(single) rotation operator H1 generates all rotations. Each rotation is associated with its

own harmonic function, exp(iφ), the phase functions for diﬀerent rotations (i.e., for diﬀerent

rotation angles φ) not being related to one another through linear operators.

B. Rotation of hyperspherical harmonics

We now turn to the analysis of the transformation described by (2.4). Note ﬁrst that

the three rotations occur in three non-intersecting planes, aﬀording the more suitable rep-

resentation exp(iφ[Jxjxk + Jyj yk]) exp(iφ Jzjzk). Arranging the Cartesian components of the

N − 1 mass-scaled Jacobi vectors ξk in the form

{x1, y1, x2, y2, . . . , xN −1, yN −1, z1, z2, . . . , zN −1},

(3.5)

we choose the Hj by selecting pairs of coordinates from this list, starting from the left:

Hj = Jxj yj ,

j = 1, . . . , N − 1

HN −1+k = Jz2k−1z2k ,

k = 1, . . . ,

N − 1
2

,

(cid:23)

(cid:22)

(3.6a)

(3.6b)

in the notation of (2.5). We have stressed repeatedly our aim of deﬁning hyperspherical

harmonics entirely through their behavior when acted upon by the operators Hj and Eǫj ,

because these operators embody the structure and symmetry of the whole system in a frame-

independent way. The explicit coordinate representation (3.6a–3.6b) of the relevant opera-

11

tors appears at variance with our intended frame-independence. However, the spatial coor-

dinates, (xj, yj, zj), j = 1, . . . , N − 1, in (3.6a–3.6b) should be viewed as generic Cartesian

coordinates; they are not tied to any particular Jacobi tree. Arranging the generic Cartesian

coordinates as we did in (3.5), on the other hand, does reﬂect physical considerations be-

yond the purely mathematical structure of rotations in higher-dimensional space: The latter

would instead label the coordinates most appropriately as (X1, X−1, X2, X−2, . . . , Xℓ, X−ℓ),

supplemented possibly with an X0 for odd-dimensional spaces. Our arrangement takes into

account that the dimension (3N −3) arises from a product structure of an (N −1)-dimensional

particle space with the three-dimensional physical space of each Jacobi vector. In particu-

lar, the arrangement (3.5) aﬀords attributing relevant physical meaning to the ﬁrst (N − 1)

eigenvalues mj, (j = 1, . . . , N − 1): They represent the z-projections of physical angular

momenta; their sum constitutes the z-projection Lz of the total orbital angular momentum,

an invariant of the system.

As is evident from (3.6a), the coordinates (xj, xk, yj, yk) occur in Hj and Hk. The x- and

y-parts of the rotation (2.4) thus involve the ladder operators that change mj and mk only.

A more detailed analysis shows that (3.3a–c) can be inverted to read:

Jxjxk + Jyjyk = E+−

jk + E−+

jk ≡ Eα(jk) + E−α(jk),

(3.7)

for 1 ≤ j < k ≤ N − 1, with α(jk) =

k−1
s=j ǫs, i.e., the ℓ-component vector with +1 as its

j-th component and −1 as its k-th component, all other entries being 0.

P

The following consideration is central to our development, providing the crucial link

between the ladder operator representation (3.7) for (Jxjxk + Jyjyk) and their transformation

matrix elements, by means of Euler-angle rotations. In analogy to the relation lx = 1

2 (l++l−)

familiar from rotations in three dimensions, we view the sum of a ladder operator Eα(jk) and

its inverse (Hermitian conjugate) E−α(jk) as describing a rotation about an analogue of the

x-axis [25]. In three dimensions, an arbitrary rotation conventionally resolves into a sequence

of three rotations: about the z-axis, about the resulting y′-axis, and about the new z′-axis,

through the Euler angles (ϕ, θ, ψ), respectively [22].

In terms of these three Euler-angle

12

rotations, a rotation about the x-axis through an angle φ results from the following sequence

of operations: The ﬁrst Euler-angle rotation about the z-axis through the angle ϕ = −π/2

rotates the y-axis onto the original x-axis; in the second step one rotates about this y′-axis

(which is the original x-axis) through the angle θ = φ; the third Euler-angle rotation ﬁnally

moves the x′-axis back to the original x-direction by rotating about the z′-axis (lying in the

original (yz)-plane) through the angle ψ = π/2. Wigner’s d-symbol is the matrix element

for the rotation of a spherical harmonic about the y-axis, d(l)

m′m(φ) = hYlm′| exp(iφly)|Ylmi,

whereas the two z-type rotations only contribute phase factors exp(i m′π/2 − i mπ/2) [22],

giving for the rotation of a spherical harmonic about the x-axis

hYlm′| exp(iφlx)|Ylmi = eim′ π

2 d(l)

m′m(φ) e−im π
2 .

(3.8)

Generalization of the concept of Euler-angle rotations from three to more dimensions

hinges on the following key observations: m and m′ serve to distinguish between degenerate

harmonics with the same l. In higher-dimensional spaces, the vector indices µ and µ′ play

the same role. However, the parameter l in the d-symbol indicates not only the angular

Laplacian’s eigenvalue l(l + 1), but also—more importantly—the range of possible m values,

−l ≤ (m, m′) ≤ l. More precisely, it sets the upper limit of 2l for the number of times either

one of the two ladder operators l+, l− can act in direct succession before necessarily mapping

any spherical harmonic Ylm to zero. (Since l+Ylm 7→ Yl,m+1, it takes l − m ≤ 2l “raising

operator” steps to reach Yll from Ylm. Applying l+ in succession (2l + 1) times necessarily

raises m beyond its upper limit. The absence of a corresponding harmonic translates to

(l+)2l+1Ylm ≡ 0.). Viewed in this way, the harmonic’s parameter m indicates its “position”

along the string (of length 2l + 1) of degenerate harmonics interrelated by a ladder operator.

We now extend these concepts to rotations in more than three dimensions.

The single m (lz’s eigenvalue) in three dimensions belongs to a string ranging from −l to

+l, accessed by the single pair of ladder operators l+, l−. In more than three dimensions, we

replace it with an ℓ-component vector µ whose components are changed (typically in pairs)

along diﬀerent strings labeled by corresponding ladder operator pairs Eα and E−α. (Recall,

13

however, that the ℓ vectors ǫj provide a basis for the vectors α; thus any ladder operator

Eα can be expressed as products of Eǫj .) The role of m as an indicator of the harmonic’s

position along the single string in three dimensions extends therefore to higher dimensions

if we project the “indicator” µ onto the “direction” of any particular string α of interest,

i.e., if we deﬁne

mα =

µ · α
α · α

,

m′

α =

µ′ · α
α · α

,

(3.9)

where the scalar product in the denominators accounts for α’s two non-zero components

in the case of a pairwise change of mj’s.

In analogy to l in the three-dimensional case,

a parameter λα determines how many times the ladder operators E±α can be applied in

direct succession. The modulus of mα in (3.9) provides a lower limit for the relevant “string

length” λα. Since the ǫj form a basis for the α, we anticipate that λα emerges from an ℓ-

component vector λ = (λǫ1, . . . , λǫℓ). The latter provides the additional parameters required

for a unique speciﬁcation of harmonics (besides µ and the eigenvalue Λ) . Note that in the

general case λα is not identical with the eigenvalue Λ, at variance with the situation in three

dimensions.

To summarize the procedure so far, we note that the x- and y-parts of the ﬁnite rotation

(2.4) aﬀect only the two components mj and mk of the vector µ, shifting mj by an integer

amount n while simultaneously changing mk by the same amount in the opposite direction.

The projections (3.9) evaluate to

with non-vanishing matrix elements for the rotation of a hyperspherical harmonic YΛ,µ,λ

into another harmonic YΛ′,µ′,λ′ occurring only if µ and µ′ lie along the same α-string of

harmonics with degenerate Λ, i.e., if an integral number n of ladder operator steps E±α(jk)

separates µ′ from µ. With our previous considerations on Euler-angle rotations leading to

(3.8), this matrix element reads

where we omitted α’s parameters j, k for brevity. The Kronecker symbols δ ensure that only

harmonics with the same eigenvalue Λ, lying along the same α-string, are connected. The

factor 2 multiplying the rotation angle φ reﬂects the absence of the factor 1/2 in the RHS

of (3.7), as compared to the expression for lx = 1

2(l+ + l−), thereby eﬀectively doubling the

rotation angle in (3.8).

It remains to apply the same concepts to the z-part of the rotation (2.4). This part

aﬀects only µ’s components that correspond to the Hκ involving zj and zk. Because we

chose to gather all the z-coordinates after all (xy)-pairs in (3.5), the Jacobi vector indices

j, k are shifted relative to µ’s components for the z-coordinates. To simplify the notation,

we use

so that Hι and mι now refer to the operator and quantum number pertaining to the coordi-

nate zj, with the same connection between Hκ, mκ, and zk. Depending on the indices j and

k, i.e., depending on the positions of the coordinates zj and zk in the sequence (3.5), Jzjzk

takes alternative forms in terms of ladder operators or Hκ. The possible cases are:

1. k even and j = k − 1. According to (3.6b), Jzj zk coincides with HN −1+k/2 ≡ Hκ. The

rotation matrix element is simply

hYΛ′,µ′,λ′| exp(iφ Jzjzk )|YΛ,µ,λi = exp(imκφ) δΛ′,Λδλ′,λδµ′,µ.

Viewing again the sum of a ladder operator and its inverse (Hermitian conjugate)

as proportional to an analogue of a rotation about the x-axis, we readily recognize

expression). With the explicit formulae (3.3a–3.3b), it is straightforward to verify

that the ladder operator E+−

other. As in the previous discussion of the x- and y-parts, an integer number of steps

ικ must connect (mι, mκ) to (m′

ι, m′

κ), i.e., m′

ι = mι + n1, m′

κ = mκ − n1. However,

the second rotation involves the same components of µ, only this time changing both

in the same direction: m′

ι = mι + n2, m′

κ = mκ + n2. Compatibility of the two

conditions requires n1 = n2 = 0, thus

obviously the sum of two y-type rotations. The “selection rules” for mι and mκ are

in case 2.

of the phase factor exp(iνπ/2).

Thus, the z-part of the rotation (2.4) takes essentially three diﬀerent forms: (i) a phase

factor exp(imκφ), diagonal in the µ, if Jzjzk coincides with Hκ; (ii) an x- or y-type rotation

through the angle φ, changing mι into m′

ι = mι + ν, as in three dimensions, if zk is the

unpaired coordinate zN −1 of an odd-dimensional space; (iii) the product of two rotations

through the angles φ/2 and (−1)kφ/2, respectively, but diagonal in µ, if zj and zk belong

to diﬀerent Hι and Hκ.

C. Harmonics suitable for rotation

In the previous subsection, we have completely determined the matrix elements for the

rotations of our interest when applied to hyperspherical harmonics, before actually specifying

these functions explicitly. This was possible because we expressed the matrix elements in

terms of the labels (“quantum numbers”) (Λ, µ, λ) identifying the harmonics, rather than

through integrals in coordinate space. So far, the harmonics are functions of the generic

Cartesian coordinates (xj, yj, zj). Upon rotation from one Jacobi tree to another, these

coordinates transform into another set (x′

j, y′

j, z′

j), j = 1, . . . , N − 1, but the harmonics,

when expressed in terms of the new coordinates, retain their functional form. In this sense,

these hyperspherical harmonics are frame-independent.

Direct solution of the angular Laplacian’s eigenvalue problem by separation of the

(3N − 4) coordinates in the second-order diﬀerential equation leads to hyperspherical har-

monics represented by standard spherical harmonics and Jacobi or Gegenbauer polynomials,

depending on the choice of hyperspherical coordinates [10,17,21]. However, these harmonics

are not simultaneous eigenfunctions of all the Hj. Consequently, they are not suitable for

our purpose, because rotating the harmonics requires knowledge of the ladder operators’

eﬀects on these functions, at least for the base set of ladder operators E±ǫj , j = 1, . . . , ℓ,

which in turn requires uniquely specifying the harmonics with labels (Λ, µ, λ). We now

construct complete sets of functions deﬁned exclusively by their behavior under the action

of the ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators Hj and E±ǫj , j = 1, . . . , ℓ. The resulting functions are

“hyperspherical harmonics”, too, because they satisfy the generalized Laplacian’s symmetry

under rotations.

The hyperspherical description separates the “hyperradial” momentum from the gener-

alized angular momentum. Each of the Cartesian coordinates xj, yj, zj, (j = 1, . . . , N − 1),

is proportional to the “hyperradius” R. The angular Laplacian’s eigenvalue parameter Λ

determines the harmonic’s degree by setting the radial scale as RΛ. Neither the Hj nor the

ladder operators E±ǫj aﬀect this radial factor, as is to be expected of angular momentum-like

18

operators. With (3N − 4) angular coordinates, a complete speciﬁcation of the harmonics

requires (3N − 5) labels in addition to Λ. The vector µ provides ℓ = ⌊(3N − 3)/2⌋ of them

in the form of the eigenvalues mj of all the Hj. The remaining labels are taken from the

ℓ-component vector λ consisting of the “string lengths” λǫj for the ladder operators E±ǫj .

The ﬁrst (ℓ − 2) components of λ suﬃce to reach a total of (3N − 4) labels if N is odd, as

do the ﬁrst (ℓ − 1) components for N even.

It remains to determine the function F introduced in (3.1). The requirement Hj F ≡ 0 for

all j implies that F depends only on (u2

j +v2

j ) (and possibly on the single unpaired coordinate

w in case (3N − 3) is odd). Furthermore, if

j |mj| = Λ the product

j(uj + i vj)mj already

P
accounts for the radial factor RΛ, i.e., F = const. in this case. This circumstance suggests

Q

constructing complete sets of degenerate harmonics with the same Λ as follows: We set m1

to its maximum value and all other mj = 0, i.e., µ = (Λ, 0, . . . , 0) [26]. For j = 1, . . . , ℓ, the

modulus of the projection mǫj = µ · ǫj/(ǫj · ǫj) sets the lower limit for the corresponding

string length λǫj . However, λǫj cannot be larger than mǫj either, for applying any of the

raising operators E+ǫj necessarily results in a vector µ′ = µ + ǫj having

j |m′

j| > Λ, i.e.,

in a harmonic not belonging to the same set of degenerate functions. With λ completely

P

speciﬁed, the ﬁrst harmonic reads

YΛ,µ,λ = cΛ (x1 + i y1)Λ;

λ = (mǫ1, 0, . . . , 0);

µ = (Λ, 0, . . . , 0),

(3.23)

where cΛ denotes a normalization constant. Starting from this ﬁrst function, we generate

harmonics by applying all the lowering operators E−ǫj ﬁrst to (3.23), then applying the E−ǫj

to the harmonics so obtained, and so on in a recursive procedure:

YΛ,µ−ǫj,λ′ =

q

1

(λǫj + mǫj )(λǫj − mǫj + 1)

E−ǫj YΛ,µ,λ

(3.24)

for all ǫj-strings that have not yet terminated, i.e., the strings having mǫj > −λǫj . The

recursive nature of the process suggests gathering together the harmonics in “levels”, with

the level of a harmonic indicating the number of lowering operator steps separating it from

the ﬁrst harmonic (3.23). At level 0 with the harmonic (3.23), the ǫ1-string is the only string

19

with non-zero length, and we can only generate one harmonic of level 1. But for ℓ > 1, this

level-1 harmonic will already have several non-vanishing m′

ǫj and corresponding λ′

ǫj , giving

rise to additional ǫj-strings starting from this level. Repeating this procedure level by level,

we work our way down until ﬁnally reaching the last harmonic with µ = (−Λ, 0, . . . , 0). The

procedure stops automatically, because applying any of the lowering operators to this last

harmonic maps it to zero (exactly as l−Yl,−l ≡ 0 in three dimensions).

In d dimensions, the total number of diﬀerent hyperspherical harmonics with the same

“grand angular momentum” Λ is [22, p. 265]

dim(Λ; d) =

2Λ + d − 2
Λ + d − 2  

Λ + d − 2

.

d − 2 !

(3.25)

For a given Λ, the procedure outlined above generates exactly dim(Λ, d) independent func-

tions, i.e., a complete set of hyperspherical harmonics. However, some of these harmonics

still require modifying for our purpose, as the following observations illustrate.

Note ﬁrst that with our choice for Eǫj , the ﬁrst (ℓ − 1) ladder operators always change

two mj in opposite directions, thus leaving

j |mj| = Λ invariant when starting from the

P
ﬁrst harmonic. For all these harmonics, the function F reduces to a constant. At some

stage during the above construction, however, an ǫℓ-string will appear along which the sum

j |mj| no longer remains constant. Since the ladder operators do not change the overall

P
radial factor RΛ, the function F accounts for any “missing powers” in

j(uj + ivj)mj for

harmonics having µ with

j |mj| < Λ. For instance, in three dimensions the lowering

Q

operator l− (E−
1

P

in (3.3c)’s notation) removes one power of (x + iy) from the “highest”

harmonic rlYll ∼ (x + iy)l = rl sinl θ exp(ilφ) while simultaneously adding a factor F = z =

r cos θ to the next harmonic rlYl,l−1 ∼ z (x + iy)l−1 = rl cos θ sinl−1 θ exp(i[l − 1]φ). In the

same way, repeated application of l− generates the higher-degree Legendre polynomials in

cos θ making up F in this case.

So far, Λ and the vector µ provide enough information to uniquely specify the hyper-

spherical harmonics; we need their additional label λ only for the purpose of determining

transformation matrix elements, not to distinguish the harmonics from one another. For

20

these harmonics, the construction described above provides the appropriate function F .

In a higher-dimensional setting, however, the Eǫj do not all commute with each other.

It is thus possible to arrive at diﬀerent functions with the same µ along diﬀerent ladder

operator sequences, starting from the ﬁrst harmonic (3.23). This is exactly the situation of

“degenerate eigenvalues”: in this case, µ, the set of eigenvalues of the Hj, has multiplicity

higher than one. Although our construction generates the appropriate number of indepen-

dent functions, thus providing a basis system for the higher-dimensional eigenspace associ-

ated with µ, we now need additional labels—to be taken from λ—to distinguish the diﬀerent

eigenfunctions with degenerate eigenvalue µ. Suppose, therefore, the vector µ occurs with

multiplicity ν > 1. Our procedure generates ν independent functions Φρ, ρ = 1, . . . , ν, all

having the same

j(uj + ivj)mj . These functions diﬀer only in their F . Harmonics suitable

for the calculation of rotation matrix elements are expressed as linear combinations

and the requirement

for j = 1, . . . , jmax

E+ǫj
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

determines the coeﬃcients aσρ for σ = 1, . . . , ν (and thus the functions F ). In this way, ap-

propriate sets of parameters (λǫ1, . . . , λǫjmax ) serve to distinguish the harmonics by enforcing

speciﬁc lengths for the diﬀerent ǫj-strings. As noted previously, the number of additional

labels required is jmax = ℓ − 2 (or ℓ − 1) for even (or odd)-dimensional spaces, respectively.

With this modiﬁcation, even the harmonics corresponding to degenerate vectors µ show the

desired behavior under rotations in d dimensions, and their transformation matrix elements

can be deduced from their “quantum numbers” (Λ, µ, λ) directly.

Finally, a remark concerning the degeneracy of µ seems in order. In three dimensions,

it is impossible to arrive at the same µ ≡ m along diﬀerent strings, because there is only

one pair of ladder operators. Nevertheless, even in this case we note that the m-components

arising for a given l (≡ Λ) occur again for l′ > l. Due to the mostly pairwise change of

21

(3.26)

(3.27)

mj in higher-dimensional spaces, we expect that a vector µ occurring for a given Λ will

appear again as a label for harmonics with Λ′ = Λ + 2, Λ + 4, . . .. For d > 4 there are

non-commuting ladder operators. Because the number of diﬀerent pathways leading from

the highest harmonic to a speciﬁc µ increases with the length of this path, µ’s multiplicity

increases with Λ. Furthermore, since diﬀerent functions F imply contributions from diﬀerent

(u2

j + v2

j )-terms, higher multiplicity—even in spaces with more than three dimensions—can

only arise for Λ −

j |mj| ≥ 2. A detailed analysis of the recursion in Λ with µ held ﬁxed

conﬁrms these expectations, yielding for the multiplicity of µ

a useful result to test the implementation of the (recursive) procedure.

IV. EXAMPLE: TWO-ELECTRON SYSTEM

For the purpose of illustration, we apply the method outlined in the preceding sections

to a Coulombic three-body system. Speciﬁcally, we consider a two-electron atom or ion

with atomic number Z, i.e., a system with only one heavy particle. The case of diatomic

molecules (two-center Coulomb system) requires additional modiﬁcations of the hyperspher-

ical approach [27].

A. Coulomb interactions among three particles

After elimination of the CM motion, a three-particle system requires two Jacobi vectors

for its description. We use three diﬀerent Jacobi trees, ξi, ηi, ζi, (i = 1, 2). With r1, r2, and

rN denoting the positions of the two electrons and the nucleus, respectively, the relevant

mass-weighted Jacobi vectors read

.

At this point, the familiar approach using the transformation of the coordinates would ex-

ploit (4.2–4.3) in a multipole expansion of the electron-nucleus interactions in terms of the

coordinates ξ1 and ξ2. In our method, however, we apply the (kinematic) rotations (4.2–

4.3) to the wave functions instead. This amounts to calculating the three interaction matrix

elements in three diﬀerent coordinate systems. The immediately obvious advantage of this

method is that each of the three terms takes exactly the same form. Each of the integrals

reduces to the same radial integral as in the textbook example of hydrogen. Higher-order

multipoles and nested integrations over powers of the coordinates do not occur.

B. Choice of Hj and ladder operators

The kinetic energy has rotational symmetry in six dimensions. Partitioning the six coor-

dinates into pairs deﬁnes three non-intersecting planes, and thus ℓ = 3 mutually commuting

rotations. We choose the corresponding ﬁrst-order operators Hj as Jx1y1, Jx2y2, and Jz1z2.

23

Here {x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2} denote the Cartesian components of the mass-weighted Jacobi

vectors. Accordingly, the harmonics—simultaneous eigenfunctions of the three Hj with

eigenvalues µ = (m1, m2, m3)—take the form

F (x2

1 + y2

1, x2

2 + y2

2, z2

1 + z2
2)

(xj + isign(mj) yj)|mj | (z1 + isign(m3) z2)|m3|,

(4.6)

2

Yj=1

where we have rewritten (3.1) so as to yield non-negative powers of the hyperradius for

either sign of the mj. The appropriate base set of three ladder operator pairs E±ǫj is then

speciﬁed by the vector labels ǫ1 = (1, −1, 0), ǫ2 = (0, 1, −1), and ǫ3 = (0, 1, 1), corresponding

to E±∓

12 , E±∓

23 , and E±±
23

in (3.3a–3.3b).

C. Labeling the basis functions

Five angles specify each point on a sphere of ﬁxed hyperradius R in six-dimensional space.

Consequently, our hyperspherical harmonics require ﬁve labels—related to the numbers of

nodes in the ﬁve angular variables—for their identiﬁcation. Besides Λ and µ = (m1, m2, m3)

we need one more label, λǫ1, the string length along the ladder operator sequences spanned

by E±ǫ1.

The set of harmonics so deﬁned diﬀers from the more familiar set labeled by quantum

numbers (l1, m1, l2, m2, nα) [17,22]. However, the latter set of harmonics does not make use

of the third eigenvalue m3. Since rotating the harmonics is accomplished by acting on them

with ladder operators which in turn act on all the mj, the conventional harmonics speciﬁed

by (l1, m1, l2, m2, nα) are not suited for our purpose. They may, of course, still serve as a

basis set in an application, being then expanded into the new set labeled by (Λ, µ, λǫ1) prior

to the actual rotation. A straightforward transformation links the two basis sets.

D. Explicit construction of harmonics with degenerate µ

As an example, we derive the expressions for some harmonics that are not completely

characterized by Λ and µ. Consider for instance harmonics with Λ = 4, µ = (1, 0, 1).

24

According to (3.28), there are two harmonics with these labels, to be distinguished by

the additional parameter λǫ1. With the particular vector µ of this example, we obtain

mǫ1 = 1

2 , thus setting the lower limit for λǫ1. The two essentially diﬀerent ways of arriving

at the set of labels (1, 0, 1) from harmonics of the next-lower level are given by an E−ǫ1-step

from µ′ = (2, −1, 1), and by an E−ǫ3-step from µ′′ = (1, 1, 2). Both of these labels have

multiplicity 1 since

j |mj| = Λ; the function F (. . .) in the corresponding harmonics reduces

to a normalization constant. Up to these normalizing factors, c1 and c2, (4.6) gives these

P

harmonics as

Y4,(2,−1,1), 3

2

= c1 (x1 + iy1)2 (x2 − iy2)(z1 + iz2),

Y4,(1,1,2),1 = c2 (x1 + iy1) (x2 + iy2)(z1 + iz2)2.

Applying the appropriate ladder operators to these harmonics provides a basis for the two-

dimensional eigenspace of degenerate µ = (1, 0, 1):

Φ1 = E−ǫ1Y4,(2,−1,1), 3

2

Φ2 = E−ǫ3Y4,(1,1,2),1

= c3 (x1 + iy1)(z1 + iz2) ([x2

1 + y2

1] − 2[x2

2 + y2

2])

= c4 (x1 + iy1)(z1 + iz2) (2[x2

2 + y2

2] − [z2

1 + z2

1]),

with constant factors c3, c4 to be ultimately absorbed into the normalization. Because Φ1 is

obtained from Y4,(2,−1,1), 3

2

by applying E−ǫ1, it behaves under the relevant rotations exactly

as is required for Y4,(1,0,1), 3

2

. Apart from the normalization constant c3, we thus ﬁnd

Y4,(1,0,1), 3

2

= c3 (x1 + iy1)(z1 + iz2) ([x2

1 + y2

1] − 2[x2

2 + y2

2]).

(4.9)

However, the second harmonic with the same µ = (1, 0, 1) does not simply coincide with

Φ2, because the latter has the same string-length λǫ1 = 3

2 as Φ1: One easily veriﬁes that

Eǫ1Φ2 6= 0.

(4.10)

We can, however, construct a harmonic Y4,(1,0,1), 1

as a linear combination of Φ1 and Φ2 by

requiring

F. Symmetry properties of basis functions

Due to the very high degeneracy of harmonics with the same grand angular momentum

Λ as expressed in (3.25), it is important to exploit various symmetries of the functions in

order to reduce the size of the hyperspherical basis. Reﬂection through the origin of the

coordinate system transforms all six coordinates into their negatives. According to (4.6),

the harmonic |Λ, µ, λǫ1i picks up a factor (−1)|m1|+|m2|+|m3| under this operation. Since all

the ladder operators change two of the mj at a time, the sum in the exponent has the same

parity as Λ. This ﬁrst observation thus restricts the basis set by allowing only even Λ for

even-parity states and odd Λ for odd-parity states.

Consider next the harmonics’ symmetry under interchange of identical particles (i.e., the

two electrons). This interchange is most easily described in the Jacobi tree {ξ1, ξ2}:

ξ1 ↔ −ξ1;

ξ2 ↔ ξ2.

(4.17)

Accordingly, the harmonic |Λ, m1, m2, m3, λǫ1i turns into the harmonic |Λ, m1, m2, −m3, λǫ1i

under interchange of the electrons while acquiring a factor (−1)m1+m3+S (where S denotes

the total spin of the two electrons). Antisymmetrized basis functions may thus be labeled

by non-negative m3 only, and m3 = 0 is possible only for harmonics with (m1 + S) even.

Furthermore, when choosing the ﬁrst-order operators Hj we have arranged the six co-

ordinates in a way that allows us to identify m1 and m2 with the z-projections of the

three-dimensional relative angular momenta l1 and l2. Therefore, the sum m1 + m2 = mtot

is the z-component of the coupled (total) orbital angular momentum L. The fact that the

Coulomb interaction does not couple states with diﬀerent mtot reduces the size of a basis

consisting of antisymmetrized harmonics accordingly. This point is particularly interesting

because the system’s invariant mtot restricts our basis, even though the corresponding total

orbital angular momentum L is not deﬁned in this basis. The reason for this seemingly

surprising fact lies in our use of ﬁrst-order operators only; hence Lz can be identiﬁed, but

not the second order operators l2

j or L2. The absence of the invariant three-dimensional L

27

is the main trade-oﬀ we have to accept when treating all transformations as rotations in a

genuinely six-dimensional space [22, especially Sec. 10.2., p. 267ﬀ].

G. Calculation of matrix elements

While Cartesian coordinates prove most appropriate for manipulating the hyperspherical

harmonics using ladder operators, hyperspherical coordinates lend themselves for the calcu-

lation of matrix elements. Speciﬁcally, the familiar representation of Cartesian coordinates

x1 = R cos α sin θ1 cos ϕ1,

x2 = R sin α sin θ2 cos ϕ2,

y1 = R cos α sin θ1 sin ϕ1,

y2 = R sin α sin θ2 sin ϕ2,

(4.18)

z1 = R cos α cos θ1,

z2 = R sin α cos θ2,

transforms (4.6) into

RΛF sin|m1| θ1eim1ϕ1 sin|m2| θ2eim2ϕ2(cos α cos θ1 + isign(m3) sin α cos θ2)|m3|,

(4.19)

where F is a function of (cos2 α sin2 θ1), (sin2 α sin2 θ2), and (cos2 α cos2 θ1 + sin2 α cos2 θ2).

Note that this form remains the same, regardless of whether the Cartesian components

(x, y, z) refer to the Jacobi vectors in tree ξ, in η, or in ζ. The relevant interaction operator

entering into the matrix element is always 1/(R cos α), for each of the three pairwise Coulomb

interactions, with the angle α referring to a diﬀerent coordinate system in each case. The θ-

and α-integrals arising in the calculation are related to the Euler Beta function [28], namely,

A multipole expansion would have forced us to split the last integral into two parts, with

diﬀerent integrands depending on whether | cos βξ1| is greater or smaller than | sin βξ2|. The

resulting integral could only be expressed as a sum of factorial quotients, rather than a single

term, as in (4.20c).

with the further simpliﬁcation γ = −β. The double summation (transforming the bra and

ket vectors between Jacobi trees) seems to spoil the present approach’s advantage over a

multipole expansion. After all, the latter also leads to two summations, namely, a sum

over the multipole order and another summation stemming from the analytical evaluation

of the nested integral over α. Note, however, that the present method achieves signiﬁcantly

more with two summations: it accounts for all the cusps in the wave functions whenever an

inter-particle separation vanishes.

Finally, the particular case of a three-body system involves two relevant Jacobi vectors

only. All possible Jacobi trees are thus related to one another by rotations in the same plane

(ξ1, ξ2). This particularity of the three-body problem might suggest arranging the Cartesian

coordinates of the Jacobi vectors in the following way:

{x1, x2, y1, y2, z1, z2},

(4.24)

rather than our choice (3.5). The Hj resulting from the above arrangement of coordinates

coincide with Jx1x2, Jy1y2, and Jz1z2, thereby simplifying the rotation of harmonics: All

rotations reduce to the ﬁrst case of (z1z2)-type rotations discussed in Sec. III B, with matrix

(4.25)

This orthogonality relation virtually eliminates the double summation over µ1, µ2 in (4.23).

However, the corresponding harmonics are now functions of (x1 ± ix2), (y1 ± iy2), and

(z1 ± iz2). Transforming to hyperspherical coordinates using

x1 = R sin α1 cos α2 cos ϕ1,

x2 = R sin α1 cos α2 sin ϕ1,

y1 = R sin α1 sin α2 cos ϕ2,

y2 = R sin α1 sin α2 sin ϕ2,

(4.26)

z1 = R cos α1 cos ϕ3,

z2 = R cos α1 sin ϕ3,

yields Hj = −i ∂
∂ϕj

, with 0 ≤ ϕj ≤ 2π and 0 ≤ αk ≤ π/2. While the Hj, as well as

the harmonics, now obviously attain their simplest form, the choice (4.24) has two serious

drawbacks: (i) None of the three eigenvalues mj of the Hj have physical signiﬁcance, and (ii)

1/|ξ1| = (x2

1 + y2

1 + z2

1)−1/2 is a (complicated) function of all ﬁve angles (α1, α2, ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3).

The latter problem is solved by using hyperspherical coordinates (4.18) instead of (4.26),

yielding for each of the combinations (x1 ± ix2), (y1 ± iy2), and (z1 ± iz2) a sum of two

terms (as opposed to the single terms obtained for (xj ± iyj) in the previous sub-sections).

Expanding powers of these binomials leads to two additional summations, leaving us with

no net gain.

V. CONCLUSION

Recognizing the independent-particle model’s failure to account for cusps due to variables

on which the wave function does not depend explicitly, we have developed a method that

satisﬁes Kato’s cusp condition through reference frame transformations. By transforming

the wave function to the appropriate reference frame, we expose the wave function’s cusp

arising from vanishing of any given particle separation rij. In addition to satisfying the cusp

condition on the wave function, this technique also simpliﬁes the calculation of the pairwise

Coulomb interaction ∼ 1/rij, as compared to the conventional multipole expansion.

30

Implementation of the approach outlined above resolves into three major tasks, all ad-

dressed in the present investigation: (i) the systematic study of the relevant transformations

between reference frames; (ii) the deﬁnition of functions suitable for such transformations;

(iii) the determination of the transformation matrix. While the literature on Lie algebra

provides ready-made solutions to problem (i), it usually fails to do so for (ii) and (iii). Fur-

thermore, the mathematical literature does not exploit the particularity of an atomic or

molecular N-body system.

More speciﬁcally, problem (i) is solved by using mass-scaled Jacobi coordinates, since the

transformations between reference frames reduce then to generalized rotations in (3N − 3)

dimensions. The Lie algebra so(3N − 3) describes these transformations completely, em-

bodied in the sets of commuting rotation operators {Hj} and ladder operators {E±ǫj },

j = 1, . . . , ⌊(3N − 3)/2⌋. To solve problem (ii) mentioned above, we have introduced basis

functions deﬁned entirely through their behavior under inﬁnitesimal rotations, i.e., when

acted upon by the operators Hj and E±ǫj . Simultaneous eigenfunctions of all the Hj con-

stitute appropriate basis functions, classiﬁed further according to their matrix elements for

the transformation between reference frames. The latter step removes possible ambigui-

ties whenever the Hj have degenerate eigenvalues. Finally, by extending the concept of

Euler-angle rotations from three to higher dimensions, we have provided the solution to task

(iii), the determination of the transformation matrix elements. For an arbitrary N-body

system, each change of reference frames considered here resolves into a sequence of basic

transformations described by these matrix elements.

In an N-body system, the high dimensionality arises from the product structure of the

(N − 1)-dimensional particle-space and the three-dimensional physical space. The basic step

in the transformation between reference frames reduces to a two-dimensional rotation in a

plane of particle-space. Upon expansion of the particle-space variables into their physical-

space components, the basic rotation induces three two-dimensional rotations in (3N − 3)-

dimensional space that are analyzed using the Lie algebra so(3N − 3). To take advantage of

the eﬃciency oﬀered by the Lie algebraic method, we treat the transformations as rotations

31

in a genuine (3N − 3)-dimensional space. Thus, we work with the ﬁrst-order diﬀerential op-

erators Hj and E±ǫj throughout. Arranging the generic Cartesian components (xj, yj, zj) of

the particle-space variables ξj appropriately, we can partially recover the product structure

characteristic for the physical application at hand: The eigenvalues of (N − 1) among the

Hj carry physical signiﬁcance and we interpret them as z-projections of orbital angular mo-

menta. Their sum represents the total angular momentum’s z-projection, an invariant of the

system. However, neither the individual angular momenta, nor the coupled (total) angular

momentum can appear in our treatment, as they are represented by second-order operators.

Other methods exploit the product structure of the (3N −3)-dimensional coordinate space to

a larger extent by solving the Laplacian’s (second-order) eigenvalue problem through separa-

tion of variables. However, the resulting hyperspherical harmonics incorporate these features

of the three-dimensional physical space at considerable cost: Transforming these functions

between reference frames proves very ineﬃcient, requiring essentially their expansion into

the equivalent sets of harmonics introduced in the present investigation.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated by explicit construction the possibility of describing

a system of N charged particles without recourse to multipole expansions. Kato’s cusp

condition is satisﬁed implicitly through reference frame transformations of the wave function.

We introduced appropriate basis functions and discussed their symmetries under particle

interchange and reﬂection through the origin. We derived the matrix elements for the

transformation between reference frames for arbitrary numbers of particles, and we showed

that the interaction matrix elements attain a simpler form as compared to the conventional

multipole expansion. Because the formalism underlying our approach relies exclusively on

ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators, it does not incorporate angular momenta, thereby limiting

its usefulness for bound state problems. However, the technique introduced here provides

signiﬁcant simpliﬁcations in scattering problems where partial angular momenta are not

resolved.

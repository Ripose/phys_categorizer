Momentum transfer to small particles by aloof electron beams

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The force exerted on nanoparticles and atomic clusters by fast passing electrons like those em-
ployed in transmission electron microscopes are calculated and integrated over time to yield the
momentum transferred from the electrons to the particles. Numerical results are oﬀered for metallic
and dielectric particles of diﬀerent sizes (0-500 nm in diameter) as well as for carbon nanoclusters.
Results for both linear and angular momentum transfers are presented. For the electron beam
currents commonly employed in electron microscopes, the time-averaged forces are shown to be
comparable in magnitude to laser-induced forces in optical tweezers. This opens up the possibility
to study optically-trapped particles inside transmission electron microscopes.

INTRODUCTION

Electromagnetic forces in optical tweezers are currently
employed to trap small particles ranging in size from
nanometers to several microns [1, 2], and to manipu-
late them in all spatial directions [3, 4]. This type of
forces is also used to characterize the elastic properties
of deformable tiny objects (e.g., living cells [5]), to ob-
tain quantitative information on mechanical properties
at small length scales [2], and in general, to ﬁx the posi-
tion of those particles so that they can be manipulated
at will.

In this context, transmission electron microscopy oﬀers
a potentially useful tool to study optically trapped par-
ticles, providing excellent spatial resolution (sometimes
below 1 ˚A) when sub-nanometer electron beams are em-
ployed [6], while allowing spectroscopic characterization
with sub-eV accuracy. Actually, transmission electron
microscopes are routinely exploited to probe local op-
tical response properties [7], and more recently, also to
determine photonic structures of complex materials [8].
A major problem that may arise when combining elec-
tron microscopy with optical tweezers or other types of
optical trapping (e.g., optical lattices [9, 10, 11]) is that
the passing electrons can kick the particles out of the
In this work, we show
trapping locations (see Fig. 1).
that the momentum transferred from the passing elec-
trons to the particles can be well below the threshold
needed to kick them out for commonly employed trapping
laser intensities, although a detailed comparison between
trapping forces and electron-induced forces suggests that
both weak and strong perturbation regimes are possible
depending on the distance between the particles and the
beam, all of them within the range that allows a suf-
ﬁciently large electron-particle interaction as to perform
electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) with signiﬁcant
statistics for in vacuo optically-trapped particles.

The moving electrons can be in fact regarded as a
source of evanescent electromagnetic ﬁeld that probes the
sample locally, and in this sense, they can be also used
to produce deformation in elastic particles, oscillations
of trapped particles around their equilibrium positions,

and other interesting eﬀects associated to the transfer of
momentum within accurately controlled spatial regions.

II. THEORY

The electromagnetic force exerted on a particle in vac-
uum is given by the integral of Maxwell’s stress tensor
over a surface S embedding the particle [12] as

where ˆn is the surface normal and Gaussian units are

obtained by integrating of F(t) over the time. This yields

The force acting on the particle is due in part to radi-
R
ation emitted as a result of interaction with the electron
and in part to the reaction force experienced by the pro-
jectile. For small particles, the eﬀect of radiation emis-
sion is negligible and the trajectory is deﬂected by an
∆p/mv, where m and v are the mass and veloc-
angle
ity of the electron. Non-retarded calculations have shown
that this angle is too small to be easily measured [13].

A. Small particles

Let us ﬁrst consider a small isotropic particle suﬃ-
ciently far away from the electron beam as to neglect
higher multipoles beyond induced dipoles. The particle
is then characterized by its frequency-dependent polar-
izability α(ω), and the force exerted by each frequency
component of the external ﬁeld E(r, ω) reduces to [14]

This expression can be derived from Eq. (2) by consider-
ing an integration surface arbitrarily close to the object
and by using the expressions for the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds induced by a small polarizable particle in terms of
its polarizability α. For an electron moving with velocity
v towards to positive z direction and passing by the ori-
gin at t = 0, the external ﬁeld is readily calculated from
Maxwell’s equations to yield

Symmetry considerations lead to the conclusion that
Rayleigh scattering of the external-electron evanescent

2

ﬁeld (4) produces a radiation pattern with inversion sym-
metry with respect to a plane perpendicular to the tra-
jectory. This means that the overall transfer of momen-
tum to the induced radiation is zero in the small-particle
limit, so that ∆pz accounts for all momentum transfer
to the moving electron along z. Then, the contribution
of each ω component to the electron energy loss rate is,
within the non-recoil approximation valid for suﬃciently
energetic electrons, vFz(ω). Actually, one ﬁnds that the
identity vFz(ω) = ¯hωP (ω) is satisﬁed, where P (ω) is
the frequency-resolved loss probability as previously ob-
tained for small particles [15]. As a consequence, Fz van-
ishes in the ω

0 limit, since P (ω) remains ﬁnite.

This behavior is quite diﬀerent from Fx, which goes
to a ﬁnite value for small ω’s, namely Fx(ω = 0) =
4e2Re
(Incidentally, momentum transfer
along x produces negligible energy transfer in the non-
recoil approximation.) This latter formula can be used
to derive a close expression for ∆px valid for arbitrarily-
large, ﬁnite objects in the large impact parameter limit.
In that case, only small ω’s contribute to F(ω), due to
the eﬀective exponential cut-oﬀ imposed by the modi-
ﬁed Bessel functions K0 and K1. This means that only
long wavelengths are relevant (to which the object ap-
pears as small), so that it can be described by its static
polarizability. Then, the ω integral can be performed
numerically to yield

For comparison, the momentum transferred to a charge

The large-b limit given by Eq. (6) is compared in Fig.
2 with more detailed calculations that include higher-
multipole moments, as described below. Also, the small
particle limit of Eq. (5) is discussed in Fig. 3.

B. Arbitrary size

For larger particles or for close electron-particle en-
counters, higher multipoles become relevant in the in-
duced forces [16]. Then, it is convenient to express the
evanescent ﬁeld of the electron in terms of multipoles
centered at the particle, so that the external electric
and magnetic ﬁelds admit the following decomposition

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the momentum trans-
fer on electron impact parameter b for alumina and sil-
ver spheres of diﬀerent radius, as calculated from Eqs. (1)
and (9). Measured optical data have been used for the di-
electric function of these materials [7]. One can observe a
nearly exponential decay of the momentum transfer with
b. Besides, the momentum transferred along the direction
of the electron velocity vector (∆pz, dashed curves) is
generally smaller than the remaining perpendicular com-
ponent (∆px, solid curves), which ﬁnds an explanation
in the fact that the contribution of these components to
the energy loss ¯hω is v∆pz + (∆px)2/m, where m is the
electron mass: since mv
∆p, ∆px is allowed to take
larger values than ∆pz for each ﬁxed ω.

≫

Notice also that ∆px converges quickly to the large b
limit [Eq. 6, dotted curves], producing a ﬁnite result un-
der the scaling of Fig. 2, unlike ∆pz, which goes faster to
0 for large b. In this limit, the electron induces a dipole in
the particle directed towards the electron, which results
in an attractive force between these two similar to the
image potential at surfaces [20], leading to a momentum
∆px ˆx. For small metallic particles and
transfer ∆p
closer encounters this picture is no longer valid and ∆px
can actually reverse its sign and have a net repulsive be-
haviour (e.g., in Fig. 2 for Ag particles of radius a = 10
nm and also for the fullerenes of Fig. 4).

≈

A more detailed analysis of the magnitude of the mo-
mentum transfer eﬀect is given in Fig. 3. The momentum
transfer is normalized to the particle mass M and the re-
sult is the change in the particle velocity induced by the
passage of the electron as a function of particle radius a.
The trajectory of the 200-keV electron under considera-
tion passes 10 nm away from the surface of the spherical
alumina particles. The full-multipole calculation [Eqs.
(1) and (9), solid curves] agrees well with the small par-
ticle limit [Eqs. (1) and (5), dashed curves] when a is
a = 10 nm. Even though the

the same conditions as in Fig. 2: small particle limit (dashed

particle is made of Al2O3 (density ρ = 4.02 g/cm3), the elec-
tron energy is 200 keV, and the distance from the trajectory
to the particle surface is 10 nm. Dotted curves show the mo-
mentum transferred from light in an optical trap (see text for
details). The inset depicts the change in the particle angular
velocity as a result of the torque exerted by the electron.

electron-particle interaction increases with the radius a,
the actual change in the particle velocity shows a nearly
exponential decay with increasing a.

In a situation where the particle is trapped by lasers
(e.g., in optical tweezers [4] or in optical stretchers [5]),
one should compare the interaction with the electrons to
the interaction with the laser light. To this end, we will
consider a trapping cw-Ti:sapphire 100-mW laser emit-
ting at a wavelength λ = 785 nm and focused on a region
of radius Rf = 10 µm. Furthermore, we will contem-
plate the momentum transferred by the laser during the
average time span ∆t between two consecutive passing
electrons in a transmission electron microscope operating
at a current of 1 nA. The particle polarizability α is all
that is needed to calculate light forces for the small radii
under discussion (a
λ), according to Eq. (3). Now,
for real α this equation deﬁnes a conservative gradient
2, where

E is the laser light ﬁeld, whereas the imaginary part of α
represents photon absorption by the particle that trans-
lates into light pressure [21]. These two components are
represented separately in Fig. 3 after multiplication by
∆t/M (dotted curves). The light pressure contribution
is calculated for an incidence plane wave with the same
photon ﬂux as the laser at its focus. The gradient force
component is obtained from the maximum force in the fo-
cus region assuming a Gaussian proﬁle for the laser ﬁeld

ǫ (like our alumina spheres), arising as a pure retarda-
tion correction associated to radiation scattering (this is
actually the origin of the light pressure component of
Fig. 3). (Incidentally, gravity would produce a velocity
change g∆t = 1.56 nm/s, which is well compensated for
in currently available optical trapping systems.)

An important conclusion that can be extracted from
Fig. 3 is that the crossover of trapping light into the main
source of momentum occurs for particles of 20 nm in di-
ameter when the electrons pass at a distance of 10 nm
from the particles surface, thus allowing one to perform
energy loss analysis of the transmitted electrons with sig-
niﬁcant statistics. Therefore, transmission electron mi-
croscopy can be combined with in-vacuo optical trapping
to study particles of sizes above some tens nm.

≪

a/v (

While the transfer of momentum by the trapping light
occurs in a continuous smooth fashion, the electrons de-
posit all of the momentum during a small time interval
∆t = 0.16 ns for 1 nA electron current). How-
∼
ever, the change in particle velocity per electron (vertical
scale in Fig. 3) produces a minute particle displacement
during ∆t (smaller than 1.6
a), and there-
×
fore, the eﬀect of the passing electrons is experienced by
the particle as a nearly continuous source of momentum
that is describable by an average force ∆p/∆t. Actually,
Fig. 3 suggests that using more intense electron beams
(with even smaller impact parameters) acting during pe-
riods of the order of one second will still not produce
ejection of the particles from their trapping locations.

10−9 nm

≪

It should be stressed that the momentum transfers that
we have calculated using classical electromagnetic the-
ory must be understood as the average value over many
incoming electrons, since the actual strength of the in-
teraction is not large enough as to guarantee that many
photons are exchanged between each electron and a given
particle. Like in aloof EELS experiments [8], most elec-
trons will not interact with the particles at all, so that the
present results must be understood under the perfectly
valid perspective of an statistical average performed over
many beam electrons. The quadratic deviation from
these average forces can play also a role (similar to strag-
gling in stopping power theory), but this subject is left
for future consideration.

We have also studied momentum transfer to C60 clus-
ters (Fig. 4). The scattering matrices tν
l have been ob-
tained within the discrete-dipole approximation [22, 23],
where each carbon atom is described by an induced dipole
whose polarizability is ﬁtted to reproduce correctly the
measured optical response of graphite [7]. Further de-
tails concerning the procedure followed to obtain tν

be given elsewhere [24]. At relatively small interaction
distances b, the z component of the momentum is larger
than the x component and the latter is negative. These
are eﬀects that can be hardly found in the above exam-
ples and that originate in high-order multipoles (actually,

FIG. 4: (color online). Momentum transferred from a 5-keV
electron to a C60 cluster as a function of impact parameter b.
The momentum is normalized to the cluster mass M .

5 are needed for convergence within the range of b
under consideration). Even at a distance of 9 nm (no-
tice that C60 has a diameter of only 0.7 nm) the change
in velocity produced by the passing electron can be sub-
stantial. Therefore, the interaction of fast electrons with
small clusters can produced dramatic eﬀects if these are
not mightily bound by a mechanism stronger than optical
trapping.

Finally, the passing electron can induce a torque on
the particle that changes its angular momentum (∆Ly)
and makes it rotate. This is the eﬀect discussed in the
inset of Fig. 3, which shows the change in angular veloc-
ity per electron, ∆Ω = ∆Ly/I, where I = (2/3)a2M is
the moment of inertia of the alumina sphere. Like the
electromagnetic force above, the torque is obtained from
the integral of Maxwell’s stress tensor [12], and the de-
tails follow a similar derivation as the one presented in
Sec. II. Averaging over the electrons of a 1 nA electron
beam passing at 10 nm from the surface of an alumina
sphere of radius a = 20 nm, one ﬁnds an angular accel-
eration of 39 MHz/s. Under these conditions, the linear
momentum transferred by the electrons can be absorbed
by the trapping light, as discussed above. However, the
angular momentum is not absorbed, and the particle will
spin with increasing angular velocity until either the cen-
trifugal force breaks it apart or radiation emission at the
rotation frequency (vacuum friction) compensates for the
electron-induced torque.

In conclusion, we have shown that fast electrons follow-
ing aloof trajectories (i.e., without direct overlap with the
sample) in a transmission electron microscope can exert
time-averaged forces on small particles of similar mag-
nitude as those forces associated to trapping in optical
tweezers and stretchers, and therefore, this eﬀect can be
used for analytical studies of mechanical properties of
such particles, while electron energy loss spectra can be
actually taken without causing ejection of the particles

from their trapping positions.

An analytical expression of a Floquet operator, which describes the evolution of a wave packet in
combined atomic and an intense laser ﬁeld, is obtained approximately in the stabilization regime.
Both the classical and quantum versions of the Floquet operator are used to study the phase-space
dynamics of atomic stabilization, and the ’fringe structure’ in the phase-space is clearly demon-
strated. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamical mechanism and characters of this striking
structure, and ﬁnd that this structure is very closely related to the classical invariant manifolds.

INTRODUCTION

for simplicity.

Atomic stabilization means that the ionization rate of
an atom decreases with increasing intensity of intense ,
high-frequency laser ﬁeld, which is one of the most in-
teresting nonperturbative phenomena observed in laser-
atom interaction and attracts much attention recently.
This eﬀect has been predicted by both quantum theories
[1] and classical theories [2], and has recently been ver-
iﬁed experimentally[3, 4]. In particular, Sundaram and
Jensen [5] connect successively this exciting phenomenon
with the chaotic dynamics.

More recently, by numerically solving time-dependent
Schrodinger equation for one-dimensional model, some
researchers have investigated the phase-space dynamics
of intense-ﬁeld stabilization and found the existence of
a striking structure - fringe structure [6, 7]. These ﬁnd-
ings enrich greatly the discussions on atomic stabilization
and helpful to better understand the stabilization mech-
anism. However, the dynamical mechanism of the fringe
structure is far from fully understood.

In this paper, using the approximate analytic expres-
sion of the evolution operator of the atom-laser system,
we shall demonstrate the fringe structure from classical
distribution and quantal Wigner distribution. Further-
more, in light of nonlinear dynamics we shall discuss the
dynamical mechanism underlying this striking structure.
As we shall see later that, the fringe structure associates
closely with the ionization process in the regime of sta-
bilization.

The one-dimensional model is widely used in studying
the atom stabilization phenomenon [1, 2] in the strong-
ﬁeld laser-atom physics, its Hamiltonian is

H(x, v, t) =

+V (x)−xF cos ωt , V (x) = −1/

1 + x2 ,

(1)
where F, ω are the strength and frequency of the oscillat-
ing electric ﬁeld, respectively. In all calculations of this
paper, the atomic units (me = e = ¯h = 1a.u.) is adopted

p

Usually, the stabilization phenomenon is discussed in
the laser-
the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) frame, i.e.
atom interaction is viewed from the stand point of a free
classical electron oscillating in a lasert ﬁeld . By this way,
the Hamiltonian becomes

HKH (q, p, t) =

+ V (q − α0 cos ωt) ,

(2)

p2

where α0 = F/ω2 is the amplitude of an electron’s quiver
motion. Notice that the wave function in the KH frame
is related to that in the length gauge by an unitary trans-
formation.

This is a periodically driven system. With the help of
a time-order exponential, the formal evolution operator
at t > 0 can be written as,

ˆU (t) = P [exp(−i

′ ˆHKH (t

))] ,

(3)

where P is the time order operator.

The time evolution operator referring to one period T

is the so-called Floquet operator

ˆF = ˆU (T ) .

(4)

If the frequency of the laser ﬁeld is assumed to be asymp-
totically high, we can discard all but the the time average
of the KH potential, namely,

V0(q) =

V (q − α0 cos ωt)dt .

(5)

Then the Hamiltonian becomes time independent and
takes the form of

¯HKH =

+ V0(q) .

(6)

The eigenstates of this system is called KH states. So one
is led to the prediction that all KH states will be stable.
However, in practical case of ﬁnite ﬁeld frequency rather

2

than an asymptotically high frequency, Sundaram and
Jensen pointed out that the high order Fourier terms are
also important and can not be neglected for simplicity.
With the assumption that every coeﬃcients of the Fourier
expansion of V (q − α0 cos ωt) are equally important, the
potential can be described by a periodic train of delta
kicks as follows,

HKH =

+ V0(q)

δ(

In [5] the validity of the above assumption has been tested
for a wide range of parameters. It is found that in the
regime of atomic stabilization the approximation can pro-
vide a good qualitative description. Provided that the
zero of time is chosen halfway between two consecutive
kicks, in terms of (3) and (7), the Floquet operator is

around P1, the phase plane is ﬁlled with chaotic trajec-
tories. In case two (ﬁg.2), with changing the parameters
, this elliptic point P1 undergoes a pitch bifurcation to
an unstable hyperbolic ﬁxed point and gives birth to a
pair of 1-periodic elliptic ﬁxed points (P2, P3) locate at
(±α0, 0) approximately. Outside these two regular is-
lands the phase plane is full of stochastic orbits. Case
three (ﬁg.3), the P2 and P3 becomes unstable, and the
phase plane is mainly ﬁlled by chaotic trajectories and
very small fraction of regular islands. In term of classical
description of ionization, the electrons initiated in the is-
lands will never be ionized. The regular islands around
high-periodic ﬁxed points are too small compared with
that of 1-periodic ﬁxed points and contribute little to the
conﬁnement of the electrons. Therefore, the above anal-
yses provide three typical parameters (F, ω) which are
used in following discussions on ionization suppression.

where R : (q, p) → (q + pT /2, p), propagates the trajec-
tory for a half-period ahead along the constant momen-
tum; K : (q, p) → (q, p − T ∂V0

the electron. Obviously, M is area-preserving in phase
plane.

By iterating M for a variety of initial conditions and
plotting the trajectories in the phase plane (q, p), we can
construct a Poincare surface of section which provides
an overview of the classical dynamics. The phase plots
of M demonstrate many diﬀerent structures for diﬀerent
parameters F and ω. A detailed analysis show that, for
the case of stabilization the phase structures can be clas-
siﬁed into three main cases as we show in Figs. 1,2 and
3. Case one, as shown in Fig.1, the P1(0, 0) is the unique
1-periodic elliptic ﬁxed point. Outside the regular island

In addition to those ﬁxed points, KAM tori and Can-
tori, another striking structures commonly existing in
ﬁg.1,2 and 3 are the fringe pattern in the lower and up-
per momentum plane. This is so called ’fringe structure’,
ﬁrst observed in classical simulations of atomic behav-
ior in the stabilization regime by Grobe and Law [8],
and recently conﬁrmed by Watson et al in their quantum
Wigner functions of quantum description [6, 7].

In view of nonlinear dynamics, the unstable manifold
of a steady state is a set of points X such that the or-
bit going backward in time starting from X approaches
this steady state. The stable manifold can be similarly
deﬁned for the forward orbit. A stable manifold can not
intersect other stable manifolds, and neither do the un-
stable manifolds . However, as chaos occur, stable and

tures and unstable manifolds is obvious.

of the symmetry of the map M, the stable manifolds and
unstable manifolds are symmetric about x axis. This fact
means that the stable and unstable manifolds intersect
with each other for inﬁnite times and form a hyperbolic
invariant set. Therefore, in the regime of stabilization
the classical ionization process is characterized by chaos.

unstable manifolds can intersect with each other. These
invariant manifolds characterize the dynamical proper-
ties of the whole system [9]. Therefore, we conjecture
that these fringe structures are relics of the unstable in-
variant manifolds. To identify it, we employ a numerical
algorithm (see e.g.
[10, 11]) to simulate those unstable
manifolds for a rather long time . The results are plotted
in the same ﬁgure so as to be compared with the fringe

FIG. 4: Phase plots of the n-cycle dynamical evolution of
10000 trajectories
initiated in a piece-line for F = 5, ω = 0.52.

To deeply understand the phase dynamics of ioniza-
ton process in the classical description, we trace 10000
trajectories which initiate on a piece-line of the phase
plane described by x = 0 and p ∈ (−0.5, 0.5). The
phase plane representation of the time-evolution of this
piece-line is shown in ﬁgure 4.
It is clear that, a clas-
sical particle is attracted by the unstable manifolds and
comes close to them along the stable manifolds, mean-
while it moves in the unstable direction determined by
the unstable manifolds. Therefore, the whole piece-line
is folded and stretched along the unstable manifolds and
demonstrates a complex geometric conﬁguration. Thus,

a particle has more probability to stay near the unstable
manifolds, this is the reason for the existence of fringes
and those gaps between them.

From the above analyses, we conclude that, unstable
manifolds play an important role in ionization process
and is the dynamical source of the striking fringe struc-
ture in the classical phase plane.

QUANTUM SIGNATURE

A stable state commonly refers to a quantal state of
atom irradiated by laser with long lifetime. As the sta-
bilization phenomenon is ﬁrst discovered in the case of
asymptotically high-frequency ﬁeld, the eigenstates of the
time-average Hamiltonian (KH states) are assumed to be
stable states .

However, in order to expect such phenomenon to per-
sist in the face of various experimental realities and can
be realistically pursued in the laboratory, the ﬁeld fre-
quency ω should be a concrete and ﬁnite rather than
asymptotically high. In this case, as was pointed out by
Sundaram and Jensen , the high-order fourier coeﬃcients
of the expansion of time-dependence Halmiltonian is also
important. Therefore, the quasienergy eigenstates of the
time evolution operator ˆU (T ) will act as the candidates
of the stable states which result in the ionization sup-
pression.

The Floquet operator is unitary and satisﬁes following

eigenvalue equation,

ˆU(T )|Ψλ >= e

−iλ|Ψλ >

(12)

where the eigenphase λ is real , λ/T is the quasienergy
(QE). The quasienergy wave function Ψλ describes QE
state. These QE states are obtained by diagonalizing
ˆU (T ) with a large basis of plane waves , |n >= |e−ipnx >
, (n = 1, 2, ..., 512).

For the operator ˆU (T ) is time-reversal invariant, let the
time-reversal operator act on the both sides of eigenval-
ues equation (12), we ﬁnd that Ψλ and Ψ∗
λ are both eigen-
functions with the same quasienergy .
In general, the
bounded states are not degenerate for one-dimensional
quantal system. It is evident that potential V0(q) is sym-
metric about zero point. Therefore we conclude that the
bound QE states can be described by real functions and
parity is a good quantum number.

In following section, we shall take the second case,
where the parameters are F = 5, ω = 1.34, as an exam-
ple for our discussion. We calculate the lowest two eigen-
functions and ﬁnd that the ground state (QE0) possesses
even parity and mainly concentrats in the zero point;
The 1-excited state (QE1) with odd parity demonstrates
dichotomous collection at ±α0.

We use the wave packet propagation method to cal-

approach, an initial wave packet is propagated by the
Fourier spectral method, which is directly applicable to
the free propagation step of the Floquet operator, with
the impulse delivered once every period. The free time
propagation step is divided into many small intervals
to reduce the error, introduced by boundary conditions.
This kinetic propagation is carried out in the momentum
space, since time evolution reduces to simple multiplica-
tion in that space. The impulsive step is performed in
coordinated space for a similar reason. A Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) routine is used to transform the wave
function between these two spaces. Since the ionization
occurs in our problem, an absorptive ﬁlter in the asymp-
totic region (> ±50α0) is used to avoid the unphysical
reﬂection of the wave packet from the grid boundary once
it is on its way out. The ﬁlter takes the form [12]

f (x) = 1/(1 + eβ(x−a))

(13)

where a is a large distance and β is the width of the ﬁlter
, the wave function is multiplied by the ﬁlter function
after each time step.

The time evolution of ground and 1-excited QE states
for the case two are plotted in ﬁgure 5 , they show a good
straight line which indicates an exponential decay e−γt.
The ionization rate γ of the corresponding QE states is
well deﬁned and relates to the extent of the stability of
the QE states.

function of time (in optical cycles) for F = 5 and ω = 1.34.
The solid and dotted lines represent the decay of norm of
initial QE0 and QE1 states, respectively, which are calculated
from quantum map.

To study the phase-space evolution of a wave packet ,

we use the Wigner function which is deﬁned by

W (q, p, t) =

∗
φ(q − τ /2, t)φ

(q + τ /2, t)eipτ dτ (14)

+∞

Z

−∞

for a given wave function φ(q, t). This Wigner function
is formally analog to the classical probability density on
phase space, and reduces to it in the limit ¯h → 0.

In the exponential decay regime the Wigner function
is time invariant except for a decay factor. Therefore, we
plot the full Wigner function(a) and its contour plot (b)
after 20 cycles of evolution in Figs.6,7. The most striking
feature of this plot is the ’fringe structure’ observed in the
upper and lower region of the ﬁgures. We also use the
term ’fringe’ to describe the striking structure observed
in the Wigner functions following Watson et al [6] .

As to the evolution of the ground QE state, the corre-
sponding Wigner distribution contains a strong positive
peak at original point and many weak positive peaks.
The strong positive peak at original point results from the
even character of the wave function. Those weak peaks
resulting in the fringe structures relates closely with the
ionization process. In the case of 1-excited QE state the
strong peak at origin is negative because of the odd par-
ity of the wave function. In our time-reversal invariant
model, parity is a good quantum number, therefore the
Wigner distributions are symmetric about the original
point. This symmetry can be observed clearly in Figs.6,7.
When we compare the quantum phase space with the
classical unstable manifolds, surprisely we ﬁnd that the
fringe structure in classical phase space also shows up.
The fringe structure in both quantum and classical phase
space has the same symmetry, and locates at the same
regions. Since the size of the fringe structures in ﬁg.6 and
7 is much larger than, the quantum uncertainty, namely,
the Planck constant ¯h(= 1), this structure is physically
signiﬁcant. So, we believe that it is quantum signature
of the classical unstable manifolds.

As a further test, we also calculate the Wigner function
of the lowest two KH states and show them in ﬁgures 8,9.
Since the wave functions are real and has ﬁnite parity,
they have the reﬂection symmetry about q axis and p
axis. Wigner distributions of the ground and 1-excited
states contain strong positive peak and strong negative
peak at original point, respectively. This character is the
same as that discussed above. However, for these bound
KH states, no fringe structure is observed. This also
implies that the fringe structure associates closely with
the ionization process.

ics of atomic stabilization in the frame of a time-reversal

The electromagnetic interactions of electrons and muons can be described to
very high accuracy within the framework of standard theory, in particular within
the hydrogen-like muonium atom. Therefore precision measurements allow to test
basic interactions in physics and to search for yet unknown forces. Accurate values
for fundamental constants can be obtained. Results from experiments on the ground
state hyperﬁne structure and the 1s-2s intervals in muonium are described together
with their relations to a new measurement of the muon magnetic anomaly.

Introduction

To present knowledge leptons have dimensions of less than 10−18m and may
therefore be regarded as point-like objects. The muonium atom (M = µ+e−) is
the hydrogen-like bound state of leptons from two diﬀerent particle generations,
an antimuon(µ+) and an electron(e−) [1,2]. The dominant interaction within
the M atom is electromagnetic and level energies can be calculated in bound
state Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) to suﬃciently high accuracy for modern
high precision spectroscopic experiments. There are also contributions from weak
interactions arising from Z 0-boson exchange and from strong interactions due to
vacuum polarization loops containing hadrons. They both can be obtained to the
required level of precision using standard theory. In contrast to natural atoms
and ions as well as artiﬁcial atomic systems, which contain hadrons, M has the
advantage that there are no complications arising from the ﬁnite size and the
internal structure of any of its constituents. Precision experiments in M can
therefore provide sensitive tests of the standard theory and searches for new and
yet unknown forces in nature. Parameters of speculative theories, which try to
expand the standard model in order to gain deeper insight into some of its not

well understood features, can be restricted. In addition, fundamental constants
like the muon mass mµ, its magnetic moment µµ and anomaly aµ and the ﬁne
structure constant α can be obtained.

All high precision experiments in M up to date atom have involved the
1s ground state (see Fig.1), in which the atoms can be produced in suﬃcient
quantities [2]. The most eﬃcient mechanism is e− capture after stopping µ+
in a suitable noble gas, where yields of 80(10)% were achieved for Kr gas [1].
This technique was used in the most recent precision measurements of the atom’s
ground state hyperﬁne structure splitting ∆νHF S and µµ at the Los Alamos
Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) in Los Alamos, USA [3]. Muonium at thermal
velocities in vacuum can be obtained by stopping µ+ close to the surface of a SiO2
powder target, where the atoms are formed through e− capture and some of which
diﬀuse through the target surface into the surrounding vacuum. This process has
an eﬃciency of a few % and was an essential prerequisite for Doppler-free two-
photon laser spectroscopy of the 12S1/2-22S1/2 interval ∆ν1s2s at the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in Chilton, United Kingdom [4], which yields an
accurate value for mµ. Electromagnetic transitions in excited states, particularly
the 22S1/2-22P1/2 classical Lamb shift and 22S1/2-22P3/2 ﬁne structure splitting
could be induced by microwave spectroscopy. However, because only moderate
numbers of atoms in the metastable 2s state can be produced with a beam foil
technique, the experimental accuracy is now the 1.5 % level [5,6], which represents
not yet a severe test of theory.

2. Ground State Hyperﬁne Structure

The most recent experiment at LAMPF used a Kr gas target inside of a mi-
crowave cavity at typically atmospheric density and in a homogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld of 1.7 Tesla. Microwave transitions between the two energetically highest
respectively two lowest Zeeman sublevels of the n=1 state at the frequencies ν12
and ν34 (Fig.1) involve a muon spin ﬂip. They were detected through a change
in the spatial distribution of e+ from µ+ decays, since due to parity violation
in the µ+ decay the e+ are preferentially emitted in the mu+ spin direction.
As a consequence of the Breit-Rabi equation, which describes the behaviour of
the levels in a magnetic ﬁeld, the sum of these frequencies equals at any ﬁeld
value the splitting in zero ﬁeld ∆νHF S and their diﬀerence yields in a known
ﬁeld µµ. The experiment utilized the technique of ”old muonium”, which al-

lowed to reduce the linewidth of the signals below half of the ”natural” linewidth
δνnat = (π · τµ)−1=145kHz, where τµ is the muon lifetime of 2.2 µ (Fig.2). For
this purpose an essentially continuous muon beam was chopped by an electro-
static kicking device into 4 µs long pulses with 14 µs separation. Only atoms
which were interacting coherently with the microwave ﬁeld for periods longer
F = 1
than several muon lifetimes were detected [7].

The results are mainly statistics limited and improve the knowledge of both
∆νHF S and µµ by a factor of three [3] over previous measurements [8]. The zero
F = 0
ﬁeld splitting is determined to ∆νHF S=ν12 + ν34 = 4 463 302 765(53) Hz (12
1/2
ppb) which agrees well with the theoretical prediction of ∆νtheory= 4 463 302
563(520)(34)(≤100) Hz (120 ppb) [10]. Here the ﬁrst quoted uncertainty is due
to the accuracy to which the muon-electron mass ratio mµ/me is known, the sec-
ond error is from the knowledge of α as obtained in electron g-2 measurements,
and the third value corresponds to estimates of uncalculated higher order terms.
The strong interaction contributes 250 Hz and a parity conserving weak inter-
action amounts to -65 Hz. Among the possible exotic interactions which could
contribute to ∆νHF S is the conversion of muonium to antimuonium, which is
in the lepton sector an analogous process to the well known K0-K0 oscillations
in the quark sector. From a recent direct search at the Paul Scherrer Insti-
tute (PSI) in Villigen, Switzerland, which itself could signiﬁcantly restrict several

speculative models, an upper limit of 9 Hz can be concluded for an expected
line splitting [9,2]. Recently generic extensions of the standard model in which
both Lorentz invariance and CPT invariance are not assumed have attracted
widespread attention in physics [11]. Such models suggest diurnal variations of
the ratio (∆ν12 − ∆ν34)/(∆ν12 + ∆ν34) [12] which are being searched for [13].

Figure 2. Samples of conventional and ‘old’ M resonances at frequency ν12. The narrow ‘old’
lines are also higher. The lines in right column were recorded using a sweep of the magnetic
ﬁeld, which was measured in units of the proton NMR frequency νP . The lines to the left were
obtained using microwave frequency scans.

The magnetic moment results from the measurements as µµ/µp = 3.183 345
24(37) (120 ppb) which translates into mµ/me = 206.768 277(24) (120 ppb). The
hyperﬁne splitting is proportional to α2R∞, with the very precisely known Ryd-
−1
berg constant R∞. Comparing experiment and theory yields α
2 = 137.035 996
3(80) (58 ppb) [3]. If R∞ is decomposed into even more fundamental constants,
one ﬁnds ∆νHF S to be proportional to α4me/h¯ . Using the value h¯ /me as deter-
−1
mined in measurements of the neutron de Broglie wavelength [14] gives α
4 =

137.036 004 7(48) (35 ppb). In the near future a small improvement in α
can

be expected from ongoing determinations of h¯ /me in measurements of the photon
recoil in Cs atom spectroscopy and a Cs atomic mass measurement. The present

limitation for accuracy of α
arises mainly from the muon mass uncertainty.

Therefore any better determination of the muon mass, e.g. through a precise

measurement of the reduced mass shift in ∆ν1s2s, will result in an improvement

4 . At present the good agreement within two standard deviations between
of α
the ﬁne structure constant determined from M hyperﬁne structure and the one
from the electron magnetic anomaly is generally considered the best test of in-
ternal consistency of QED, as one case involves bound state QED and the other
one QED of free particles.

1s-2s Energy Interval

Doppler-free excitation of the 1s-2s transition has been achieved in the past
at KEK in Tsukuba, Japan, [15] and at RAL [16]. The accuracy of the latter
measurement was limited by ac Stark eﬀect and a frequency chirp caused by rapid
changes of the index of refraction in the dye solutions of the ampliﬁer stages in
the employed high power laser system. A new measurement has been performed
very recently at the worlds brightest pulsed surface muon source at RAL [4].

The 12S1/2(F=1) → 22S1/2(F=1) transition was induced when thermal muo-
nium atoms interacted with the light ﬁeld of two counter-propagating laser beams
of wavelength 244 nm. The two-photon excitation was detected by photoiniza-
tion of the 2s state in the same light ﬁeld. The muons released thereby were
identiﬁed and counted. Their number as a function of laser frequency represents
the experimental signal (Fig.3). The necessary high power UV laser light was

generated by frequency tripling the output of an alexandrite ring laser ampliﬁer
in crystals of LBO and BBO. The alexandrite laser was seeded with light from a
continuous wave Ar ion laser pumped Ti:sapphire laser at 732 nm. Fluctuations
of the optical phase during the laser pulse (chirping) were compensated with two
electro-optic devices in the resonator of the ring ampliﬁer to give a swing of the
laser lights frequency chirping of less than about 5 MHz. The fundamental op-
tical frequency was calibrated by frequency modulation saturation spectroscopy
of the a15 hyperﬁne component of the 5-13 R(26) line in thermally excited 127I2
vapour which lies about 700 MHz lower than 1/6 of the M transition frequency.
It has been calibrated to 0.4 MHz [18]. The cw light was frequency up-shifted by
passing through two acousto-optic modulators (AOM’s).

The experiment yields ∆ν1s2s(expt.) = 2 455 528 941.0(9.8) MHz in good
agreement with a theoretical value of ∆ν1s2s(theory) = 2 455 528 935.4(1.4) MHz
[19]. From these values the muon-electron mass ratio is found to be mµ+/me−
= 206.768 38(17). Alternatively, using mµ+ /me− extracted from the M hyperﬁne
structure experiment a comparison of ∆ν1s2s(expt.) and ∆ν1s2s(theory) yields
the µ+-e− charge ratio as Z = qµ+/qe− = −1 − 1.1(2.1) · 10−9. This is the
best veriﬁcation of charge equality in the ﬁrst two generations of particles. The
existence of one single universal quantized unit of charge is solely an experimental
fact for which no associated underlying symmetry has yet been revealed. Gauge
invariance assures charge quantization only within one generation of particles.

4. Muon Magnetic Anomaly

The muon magnetic anomaly aµ is given, like in case of the electron, mostly
by photon and by electron-positron ﬁelds. However, the eﬀects of heavier particles
is enhanced by the square of the mass ratio mµ/me ≈ 4 · 104. The contributions
of the strong interaction, which can be determined from a dispersion relation
with the input from experimental data on e+-e− annihilation into hadrons and
hadronic τ -decays, amounts to 58 ppm. The weak interaction adds 1.3 ppm.
At present standard theory yields aµ to 0.66 ppm. Contributions from physics
beyond the standard model may be as large as a few ppm. Such could arise from,
e.g., supersymmetry, compositeness of fundamental fermions and bosons, CPT
violation and many others.

A new determination of aµ [20] is presently carried out in a superferric
magnetic storage Ring [21] at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in

Klaus P. Jungmann / Muonium Spectroscopy

Upton, USA. It is a g-2 experiment in which the diﬀerence of the spin precession
and the cyclotron frequencies is measured. In a ﬁrst startup run, approximately
the same level of accuracy for µ+ could be reached as the ﬁnal result for this
particle in a preceding experiment at CERN [22]. Several technical improvements
were installed since, the most signiﬁcant of which is a magnetic kicker, which
allows to inject muons directly into the storage ring. This enhances the number
of stored particles by almost two orders of magnitude compared to the early
stages of the experiment when the stored muons were born in the decays of
injected pions. Data have been taken which are expected to yield aµ to 1 ppm.
The data analyzed so far have give the value with 5 ppm uncertainty. The value
agrees with the prediction of standard theory. The experiment aims for a ﬁnal
precision of 0.35 ppm. To be able to reach this goal, it is essential to have µµ to
the 0.1 ppm level from muonium spectroscopy, since this quantity is important
in the extraction of the experimental result.

The experiment is planed for both µ+ and µ− as a test of CPT invariance.
This is of particular interest in view of the suggestion by Bluhm et al. [11] and
Dehmelt et al.
[23] to compare tests of CPT invariance in diﬀerent systems on
a common basis, i.e. the energies of the involved states. For measurements of
magnetic anomalies this means that the energies of particles with spin down in
an external ﬁeld need to be compared to the energies of antiparticles with spin
up. The nature of g-2 experiments is such that they provide a ﬁgure of merit
m·c2 for a CPT test, where a− and a+ are the positive and
r = |a− − a+| · h¯ ωc
negative particles magnetic anomalies, ωc is the cyclotron frequency used in the
measurement and m is the particle mass. For the past electron and positron
measurements one has re = 1.2 · 10−21 [23] which is a much tighter test than
in the case of the neutral kaon system, were the mass diﬀerences between K 0
and K 0 yield rK = 1 · 10−18. An even more stringent CPT test arises from
the past muon magnetic anomaly measurements were rµ = 3.5 · 10−24, which
may therefore already be viewed as the presently best known CPT test based
on system energies. With improvement expected in the BNL g-2 experiment one
can look forward to a 20 times more precise test of this fundamental symmetry.

5. Future possibilities

All precision M experiments are now limited by statistics. Therefore sig-
niﬁcant improvements can be expected from either more eﬃcient M formation,

which might in principle be possible to a small extent in the case of thermal M
in vacuum. The best solution, however, would be muon sources of higher intensi-
ties. Such may become available in the intermediate future the Japanese Hadron
Facility (JHF), or the Oak Ridge (or a possible European) Spallation Neutron
Source (NSS) Also the discussed Oak Ridge neutron spallation source. The most
promising facility is, however, a muon collider [24]; its front end will provide
muon rates 5-6 orders of magnitude higher than present beams (Table 4).

At such facilities there is in addition to more precise measurements in M
a variety of experiments on artiﬁcial atoms and ions like muonic hydrogen and
muonic helium which will allow to extract important parameters describing the
hadronic particles within these systems or fundamental interactions, which could
in no physical experiment thus far be accessed with sufﬁcient precision for atomic,
nuclear and particle theory [25,26]. It should be noted that new experimental
approaches [9,27] would also become feasible which might beneﬁcially take ad-
vantage of, e.g., the time evolution of the atomic systems.

6. Conclusions

Although the nature of the muon - the reason for its existence - still re-
mains a mystery, both the theoretical and experimental work in fundamental
muon physics, have contributed to an improved understanding of basic particle
interactions and symmetries in physics. Particularly muonium spectroscopy has
veriﬁed the nature of the muon as a point-like heavy lepton which diﬀers only in
its mass related parameters from the others. This fact is fundamentally assumed
in every precision calculation within standard theory. In addition, the measure-

ments provide accurate values of fundamental constants.

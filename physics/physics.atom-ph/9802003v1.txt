Abstract

Using a conﬁguration interaction approach we study statistics of the dipole
matrix elements (E1 amplitudes) between the 14 lower states with J π =
4− and 21st to 100th even states with J = 4 in the Ce atom (1120 lines).
We show that the distribution of the matrix elements is close to Gaussian,
although the width of the Gaussian distribution, i.e. the root-mean-square
matrix element, changes with the excitation energy. The corresponding line
strengths are distributed according to the Porter-Thomas law which describes
statistics of transition strengths between chaotic states in compound nuclei.
We also show how to use a statistical theory to calculate mean squared values
of the matrix elements or transition amplitudes between chaotic many-body
states. We draw some support for our conclusions from the analysis of the 228
experimental line strengths in Ce [J. Opt. Soc. Am. 8, 1545 (1991)], although
direct comparison with the calculations is impeded by incompleteness of the
experimental data. Nevertheless, the statistics observed evidence that highly
excited many-electron states in atoms are indeed chaotic.

I. INTRODUCTION

The aim of this work is to present more evidence that excitation spectra of complex
open-shell atoms, and probably any other atom at suﬃcient excitation energies, display clear
quantum chaotic features. This phenomenon is caused by strong mixing of many-electron
excited states by the residual two-body Coulomb interaction. It manifests in particular in a
Gaussian statistics of the E1 amplitudes for these states.

Since the time of Bohr’s hydrogen atom theory atoms were considered as perfectly regular
dynamical systems. As the classical theory of chaos evolved it became apparent that highly
excited atomic states in the Rydberg range could become chaotic if an external ﬁeld is
applied [1], as long as the underlying classical motion is chaotic.

On the other hand, it was also due to Bohr that the notion of compound nuclei was
introduced in physics. The behaviour of these highly excited nuclear states is essentially
quantum-mechanical. Nevertheless, they display a number of chaotic properties. For ex-
ample, the statistics of their energy spectra show certain universal features, and transition
amplitudes involving compound states obey Gaussian statistics [2]. To describe these prop-
erties it was suggested by Wigner that the Hamiltonian of a compound nucleus could be
modeled by a random matrix, and diﬀerent characteristics found by averaging over ensembles
of such matrices (see reviews [3,4]).

The ﬁrst insight into quantum chaotic properties of complex atoms was given by Rosen-
zweig and Porter [5] who analyzed experimental spectra of some neutral atoms and showed
that in heavy open-shell atoms the spectral statistics are similar to those of compound
nuclei. That analysis was later extended and reﬁned in [6]. Of course, the study of eigen-
values provides valuable information about the system. On the other hand, the spectral
statistics observed in heavy open-shell atoms are similar to those of the hydrogen atom in
a strong magnetic ﬁeld [7], or even a particle in a 2-dimensional classically ergodic billiard
[8]. However, the eigenstates of these quantum systems must be completely diﬀerent, and it
is clear that the eigenvalue statistics cannot really tell us much about the origin of chaotic
behaviour, or indeed the structure of the chaotic eigenstates.

The ﬁrst inquiry into the possibility of chaos in the eigenstates of complex atoms was
done by B. Chirikov [9]. He studied conﬁguration compositions of eigenstates of the Ce
atom using data from the tables [10], and came to the conclusion that the ‘eigenfunctions
are random superpositions of some few basic states’. Inspired by that work we conducted an
extensive numerical study of the spectra and eigenstates of complex open-shell atoms, using
the rare-earth atom of Ce as an example [11–13]. This allowed us to investigate many-body
quantum chaos in a real system. We showed that atomic excited states are in fact similar to
nuclear compound states and developed a statistical approach for analyzing their properties.
Unlike eigenvalues, the eigenfunctions are not observable directly. To probe the structure
of the chaotic eigenstates one can look at the transition probabilities or matrix elements of
some external perturbation coupling them to each other, or to regular, simple eigenstates
(like the ground state). The matrix elements involving chaotic eigenstates must have Gaus-
sian statistics. We showed that its main characteristics – the mean squared value of the
matrix element between the chaotic multiparticle states (compound states), can be calcu-
lated in terms of statistical parameters of the eigenstates and single-particle amplitudes and
occupation numbers of the orbitals present in the compound states [11,14].

In this work we have chosen the quantity most easily accessible experimentally – the
E1 amplitudes. It also gives us an opportunity to look for experimental signatures of chaos
in the Ce atom using the work by Bisson et al [15], where over 200 line strengths were
measured for transitions between a large number of levels within 3.5 eV of the ground state.
It should be mentioned that there are many other possible atomic systems to search for
quantum chaos, e.g., in doubly excited states and inner-shell excitation spectra of alkaline-
earth atoms [16–18], or even multiply excited states of light atoms [19].

A. Chaotic many-body states

Let us now recall brieﬂy what chaotic many-electron atomic eigenstates are. Suppose

situation is similar to that in compound nuclei and the corresponding chaotic eigenstates

expect that such matrix elements display Gaussian statistics with zero mean. Hence, the
probability distribution of the matrix elements between compound states can be character-
ized by their mean squared value alone.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR THE CE ATOM

A. Energy levels

Cerium, Z = 58, is the second of the lanthanide atoms. Its electronic structure consists of
the Xe-like 1s2 . . . 5p6 core and four valence electrons. The atomic ground state is described
by the 4f 6s25d conﬁguration with J π = 4− [10].

The origin of the extremely complex and dense excitation spectra of the rare-earth atoms
is the existence of several open orbitals near the ground state, namely 4f , 6s, 5d, and 6p,
or, in relativistic notation, 4f5/2, 4f7/2, 6s1/2, 5d3/2, 5d5/2, 6p1/2, and 6p3/2. These make
a total of Ns = 32 single-electron states. For Ce with n = 4 valence electrons there are
about (Ns)n/n!
104 possible many-electron states constructed of them. If we allow for
the two possible parities, about ten possible total angular momenta J, and 2J + 1 diﬀerent
projections (another factor of ten), there will be still hundreds of energy levels within a given
J π manifold.

In the present work we perform relativistic conﬁguration interaction calculations in the
Hartree-Fock-Dirac basis analogous to those in [11]. In that work we limited ourselves to
just 7 nonrelativistic conﬁgurations constructed of the 4f , 6s, 5d, and 6p orbitals, for both
odd and even states, which produced 260 and 276 states with J π = 4− and 4+, respectively.
To make the results more realistic we have extended the conﬁguration basis set by 9 odd and
23 even nonrelativistic conﬁgurations. Basically, the additional conﬁgurations were obtained
by exciting one of the four electrons of an “old” conﬁguration into the next orbital, e.g., the
lowest even 4f 26s2 conﬁguration would produce 4f 6s25f , 4f 6s27p, 4f 26s7s, and 4f 26s6d
conﬁgurations. To keep the size of the conﬁguration space reasonable we included only
the conﬁgurations with mean energies within about 10 eV from the Ce ground state. This
increased the total number of 4− and 4+ states to 862 and 1433, respectively. Note that
J = 4 states have been chosen because these manifolds are among the most abundant.
E(i)) has increased greatly above 4 eV and
i δ(E
become closer to that observed experimentally. Of course, to be meaningful the level density
must be averaged over some small energy interval to obtain a smooth function rather than
a set of spikes. An alternative procedure is to look at the cumulative number of levels

which we present in Fig. 1 for J π = 4+ states. Each N(E) plot is a staircase of steps of the
unit height occurring at successive excited state energies. The level density can be easily
estimated from the slope of the N(E) plot. The experimental data for the 132 even levels

with J = 4 known from [10] is shown by the solid-line staircase, and the energies are given
with respect to either experimental, or calculated ground state energy. They can be com-
pared with the dashed line that shows N(E) for our earlier small-basis calculation [11] (276
states), and the dotted line for the present calculation (1433 states). The improvement is
obvious, however, the agreement is not perfect. We believe that the remaining disagreement
is not due to some missing conﬁgurations in the CI calculation, but rather due to an overall
“softening” of the spectra due to screening of the Coulomb repulsion between the valence
electrons by the electrons of the core [22]. In the CI language this eﬀect is produced by
the high-energy excitations of the valence electrons into the continuum together with the
electron excitations from the core.

Two typical features can be observed in the spectra of complex atoms [6]. The ﬁrst clearly
seen in Fig. 1, is the rapid increase of the level density ρ(E) with energy [23]. Its origin
is purely combinatorial – the larger the excitation energy, the greater the number of ways
it can be distributed among a few single-particle excitations. In the independent-particle
model this dependence is described by the following exponent [2]:

ρa(E) = ρ0 exp

a

E

Eg

(cid:16)
where ρ0 and a are some constants, and Eg is the ground state energy of the sys-
tem. This dependence also follows from the thermodynamic deﬁnition of the temperature,

spectra of rare-earth atoms and their ions examined in [6] are in agreement with Eq. (12).

Figure 1 shows that the calculated cumulative level number plot is ﬁtted well by

N(E) =

ρa(E′)dE′

E

Z

with ρ0 = 0.65 eV−1, a = 2.55 eV1/2, and the “ground state” energy of the 4+ sequence Eg
shifted by 0.25 eV up from the true J π = 4− ground state of Ce. Thus, Eq. (12) gives a
good overall ﬁt of the calculated level density below 6 eV.

The second feature typical for the spectra of complex many-body systems is level repul-
sion. It is a basic quantum mechanics fact that two levels with identical quantum numbers
cannot be degenerate if they are coupled by a non-zero matrix elements – they “repel”
each other. In quantum chaotic systems this repulsion is characterized by the Wigner level
spacing distribution

(12)

(13)

(14)

where s is the nearest-neighbour level spacing normalized so that s =
sP (s)ds = 1.
Equation (14) shows that the probability of ﬁnding small level spacings is indeed vanishingly
small. As we pointed out in the Introduction, spectral statistics do not tell much about the
eigenstates of the system. However, Eq. (14) is still a good test for some possible hidden
quantum numbers, e.g., the total spin or orbital momentum, which might characterize atomic
eigenstates besides J π. If these do exist, small level spacings (“degeneracies”) will be more
abundant than predicted by Eq. (14). These statistics were checked for many experimental

[5,6,11,16,18] and calculated [11,17] complex atomic spectra, as well as for molecular vibronic
spectra [24].

As seen from Fig. 1 the level density changes signiﬁcantly for the ﬁrst 500 levels of the
calculated spectrum. To analyze the distribution of the corresponding level spacings we use
the analytical density ﬁt ρa(E) to normalize the spacings:

sn = (En+1 −

En)ρa(En).

(15)

Their distribution shown on the inset in Fig. 1 is in reasonable agreement with the Wigner
formula. The deviations are probably due to the long-range ﬂuctuations of the level density,
not accounted for by the simple exponential (12). In the previous calculation [11], where
only the lowest orbitals of each symmetry were included, we also observed the Wigner
distribution. When orbitals with higher principal quantum numbers become involved (as
seen from Fig. 1 above 3.5 eV) the spatial extent of the eigenstates increases. This should
cause a decrease of the residual Coulomb interaction between the electrons. On the other
hand, the level spacings also become smaller. As a result, the state mixing at these excitation
energies remains strong, which is conﬁrmed by the agreement with the Wigner distribution,
and the eigenstates are chaotic. Our estimate of the number of principal components N
shows that it becomes even greater as the energy increases, in accord with the estimate
N

1 eV, and the mean level spacing D

0.003 eV at E

B. Dipole matrix elements

In Sec. II we explained that matrix elements involving chaotic compound states should
have Gaussian statistics, and the mean squared value of the matrix elements could be esti-
mated in terms of some average characteristics of the compound states. In this section we
concentrate on the dipole matrix elements (E1 amplitudes) dik =
between
the 14 lowest states with J π = 4− and 80 consecutive 4+ states obtained numerically in our
CI calculations of Ce. We have chosen this energy region to cover the range explored in
the experiment [15], where absolute values were derived for 228 of the most intense lines of
neutral Ce between 10706 and 22184 cm−1.

Of course, low-lying atomic states, e.g., the ground state, have well-deﬁned conﬁguration
composition and are not chaotic, hence, the E1 amplitudes between them should not be
distributed in any particular statistical way. However, the matrix elements (2) will become
random (and close to Gaussian) as soon as at least one of the states involved, the initial
or the ﬁnal, moves into the compound-state energy range and becomes a superposition of
many random components. Besides that, the mean squared value of the matrix element
is expected to show some smooth secular variation with the energy of the states involved.
For these reasons we skip the ﬁrst 20 states with J π = 4+ and analyze the statistics of the
80 = 1120 E1 amplitudes for the following 80 even states by grouping them in bunches of
14
twenty: 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100, which correspond to the mean excitation energies
of 2.49, 2.95, 3.40, and 3.70 eV above the atomic ground state (the mean energy of the
lowest 14 odd states is 0.68 eV). Thus, each plate in Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the
280 reduced dipole matrix elements together with their root-mean-square (r.m.s.) value.
Also shown in Fig. 2 are the Gaussian distributions g(d) = exp(
0, where the

root-mean-square parameter d0 has been adjusted to minimize χ2 around the center of the
histogram. The values of d0 and χ2 are given in Table I.

Two eﬀects can be seen in Fig. 2. First, the distributions of the matrix elements are
indeed close to Gaussian. Second, the width of the distributions (the mean squared value of
the matrix elements) varies with the energy of the even states. It is mostly this eﬀect that
is responsible for the visible discrepancies between the histograms and the Gaussian ﬁts. To
eliminate it we can use a running average procedure to normalize the amplitudes:

on the energy of the even state E(i). Fluctuations aside, it is in agreement
amplitude
with the r.m.s. values calculated from the statistical theory, Eq. (8), at the energies of the
30th, 50th, 70th and 90th even states. The numerical values of the r.m.s. E1 amplitudes
are listed in Table I.

Note that we have chosen Eq. (8) with 1 standing for the odd states and 2 for the even
ones. In our numerical example we consider the dependence of the r.m.s. E1 amplitude on
the energy of the even states, and keep the odd states the same. Therefore, as in Eq. (8),
we only need to know the average occupation numbers for the lowest 14 odd states, and
the result depends on the ﬁnal even state via its energy E(2), mean level spacing D2 and
spreading width Γ2. As we saw in our previous calculations [11], the even states of Ce with
J = 4 become very much chaotic at excitation energies of just 2 eV, i.e. from the 20th level
up. Also, as earlier in [11], we use average conﬁguration energies rather than single-particle
Hartree-Fock energies to determine the transition frequencies ωn′l′j,nlj needed for calculation
of ∆ in Eq. (8). The ground state of Ce is described as 4f 6s25d, however, the dominant
conﬁguration among the 14 lowest odd states is 4f 6s5d2, and we used it to calculate the
transition energies. For example, the energy of the 6s
6p transition ω6p,6s was determined
as the diﬀerence between the average energies of the 4f 5d26p and 4f 6s5d2 conﬁgurations.
Physically, this corresponds to choosing a particular mean ﬁeld close to that of the low-lying
odd states of Ce for calculation of the transition energies. It should be mentioned though
ǫn′l′j′ were not
that the results obtained with the Hartree-Fock frequencies ωnlj,n′l′j′ = ǫnlj −
too diﬀerent.

where S is the mean line strength. Divergence of this function at small S means that if the E1

complex atoms [25], and transitions between the vibronic levels in molecules measured in
[24].

IV. ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA

In [15] absolute values of gA were obtained for 228 of the most intense observed lines
between 10706 and 22184 cm−1 in Ce. It is interesting to analyze these data to see whether
they support our theoretical and numerical considerations.

The values of gA listed in [15] are deﬁned as gA = (2Jk + 1)Aki, where

(18)

(19)

(20)

is the E1 transition rate from the upper level k into the lower level i [26]. We use the
experimental values of gA, Jk and transition frequencies ωki to extract values of the line
strengths

In Fig. 4 the probability distribution of the 228 experimental line strengths is shown.
Compared to the expected PT formula (17), there is a clear lack of small line strengths.
Nevertheless, the decreasing part of the histogram can be ﬁtted well by a PT distribution
with an additional normalization factor A,

fA(S) =

S/2S)

−

,

shown in Fig. 4 by a solid line for A = 2.07 and S = 3.3 a.u. that minimize χ2 for the 22
bins with S > 3 a.u.

It would be tempting to say that the excellent agreement between the PT curve and the
histogram is a conﬁrmation of the Gaussian statistics of the E1 amplitudes in Ce. The value
of A would then indicate that about one half of all lines are missing in the experimental
data. However, the value of S = 3.3 a.u. corresponds to the r.m.s. E1 amplitude of 1.8,
which is more than 2 times greater than our numerical results in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 (inset)
and in Table I. On the other hand, the experimentally observed 228 lines include transitions
between levels with various total angular momenta between J = 1 and 8 (
1, of
|
course) whereas we have about 500 hundred lines with just Ji = Jk = 4 in our calculation
in the analogous energy range. This means that in [15] only the strongest 10% or less of all
lines have in fact been measured. The very suggestive agreement with the PT distribution
in Fig. 4 should then be considered as merely fortuitous.

It is worth noting that in experiment the lines are selected by their intensities propor-
tional to gA, rather then strengths. Hence, even lines with large strengths can be omitted
if their frequencies are small. Let us look at the simplest model of this eﬀect and see how
it inﬂuences the observed strengths distribution. Assume that transitions in a certain fre-
quency range 0 < ω < ωmax are studied, and diﬀerent values within this interval are equally
probable. The observed intensities of the lines are proportional to ω3S. If we assume that
there is a minimal threshold intensity that can be registered, the original PT distribution of
strengths would be modiﬁed as follows:

where S0 is the minimal strength that can be observed at ω = ωmax, and A is the normal-
ization factor. As seen from Fig. 4, Eq. (21) also gives a very good ﬁt of the experimental
data with S = 2.4, S0 = 1.12 and A = 6.22 [27]. Note, however, that the new value of the
mean line strength is 1.5 times smaller than the one we had from the pure PT ﬁt. There-
fore, the assumptions used in our processing of the experimental data aﬀect the estimates
of the experimental r.m.s. E1 amplitudes, and we should not be too concerned about the
apparent disagreement with our numerical calculations. Besides that, extraction of absolute
line strengths from the experimental data is not free from uncertainties estimated in [15] at
10–20%.

For 30 transitions in Ce the gA values were obtained more accurately from branching
ratios and delayed photoionization measurements of lifetimes ( [15], Table 2). When we
look at the statistics of the corresponding line strengths (Fig. 4, inset) and compare it with
the PT distribution (17), a value of S = 2.15 is obtained, much smaller than the estimates
of S from the statistics of the 228 lines. Thus, it appears that to make ﬁrm conclusions
about Gaussian statistics of the E1 amplitudes a much more thorough experimental survey
is needed. On the other hand, even relative measurements of a large number of line strengths
could be very valuable for examining these statistics [24].

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have extended the conﬁguration interaction approach of [11] to calculate
large numbers of eigenstates in Ce. In agreement with our earlier studies the energy level
statistics indicate that the simple conﬁgurational basis states are strongly mixed together
by the residual electron interaction, and the only good quantum numbers in the spectrum
are parity and the total angular momentum. The total orbital momentum L and spin S are
not conserved due to the spin-orbit interaction, whose eﬀect is dynamically enhanced, just
as that of any other perturbation in a chaotic many-body system [11].

The strong conﬁguration mixing makes multielectron atomic eigenstates chaotic. This
in turn results in a Gaussian statistics of the matrix elements for chaotic atomic eigenstates
(compound states). This understanding is fully conﬁrmed by our numerical calculations of
the 1120 E1 amplitudes between the 14 lowest J π = 4− states and 80 J π = 4+ states above
2 eV. It is important that the parameter of the Gaussian, the r.m.s. E1 amplitude, varies
slowly with the excitation energy. This eﬀect should be taken into account when analyzing
the statistics of the matrix elements.

We also show that a statistical theory can be used to estimate mean squared matrix
elements involving compound states. It enables one to express the answer in terms of the
single-particle matrix elements and occupation numbers, and parameters of the compound
states, namely the number of principal components and the spreading width. This approach
has already been applied to calculation of matrix elements between compound states in
nuclei [14].
It could be useful in various other many-body systems, e.g., atomic clusters
or quantum dots, where direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix is not feasible
because of a huge size of the Hilbert space of the problem.

11

An attempt has been made to analyze existing experimental data for the line strengths
in Ce [15]. It appears that the statistics of the measured line strengths is compatible with
the Porter-Thomas distribution, with allowance for the missing weak lines. However, the
discrepancy between the calculated r.m.s. E1 amplitudes and those inferred from the ex-
perimental data does not allow us to say that the existence of quantum chaos in the Ce
eigenstates has been conﬁrmed experimentally. To make this statement one would have to
do a much more complete survey and statistical analysis of the line strengths in the Ce
spectrum.

On the other hand, this means that a comparison between the experimental and the-
oretical line strengths in Ce is not yet possible, even at the level of their mean values.
Theoretically, to calculate precisely the dipole matrix elements between particular levels in
the compound-state energy range of complex atoms like Ce looks a prohibitively diﬃcult
problem. Experimentally, identiﬁcation of speciﬁc lines in enormously complicated spectra
is also a very diﬃcult task. However, we would like to suggest that extraction of mean
characteristics from the experiment and comparison with the corresponding theoretical esti-
mates is a meaningful way of exploring such complex systems. As a result, one might hope
to get a deeper insight into the existence of quantum chaos in many-body systems on the
whole, and in complex open-shell atoms, in particular.

[20] If the number of active electrons in the system is more than two, the Hamiltonian matrix
Hjk appears to be sparse, i.e., there is a certain fraction of zero oﬀ-diagonal matrix
elements in it (only the basis states that diﬀer by the positions of no more than two
electrons can be coupled by the two-body Coulomb interaction). In this case one should
compare the magnitude of Hjk with the mean “distance”
between the basis
states directly coupled by non-zero Hjk. See, e.g. P. Jacquod and D. L. Shepelyansky,

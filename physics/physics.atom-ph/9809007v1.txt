We present a new hybrid method to solve the relativistic Hartree-Fock-Roothan equations where
the one- and two-electron radial integrals are evaluated numerically by deﬁning the basis functions
on a grid. This procedure reduces the computational costs in the evaluation of two-electron radial
integrals. The orbitals generated by this method are employed to compute the ionization potentials,
excitation energies and oscillator strengths of alkali-metal atoms and elements of group IIIA through
second order many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). The computed properties are in excellent
agreement with the experiment and other correlated theories.

I. INTRODUCTION

The two most critical choices in the application of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) [1–3] (relativistic as
well as non-relativistic) to atomic and molecular systems involve the appropriate selection of basis functions and
the partitioning of the full Hamiltonian H into a zeroth order Hamiltonian H0 and a perturbation V [4–6]. These
choices become extremely important when highly accurate estimates of various properties are demanded from low
order perturbative computations. Intensive research has focused on developing appropriate basis sets and methods
[5–8] to minimize the error between the theoretically computed properties and its experimental value. The strong
dependence of the convergence of MBPT on the choice of H0 was ﬁrst demonstrated by Kelly [4] in his pioneering work
on beryllium atom. Using a V N −1 instead of the traditional V N potential for the excited orbitals, Kelly obtained a
vast improvement in the perturbative convergence for that atom. He also demonstrated that more rapid convergence
can be achieved from a shifted denominator that corresponds to the summation of a certain class of diagrams to all
order.

It is well-known that the theoretical treatment of the heavy atoms must incorporate certain special features that
are not essential for the light atoms. This is largely due to the fact that the relativistic eﬀects are so large for heavy
atoms that it is imperative to treat them by using the relativistic Dirac equation. Despite its enormous computational
complexity and cost, tremendous progress has been made over the past decade and a half in solving the four-component
Dirac equations for many-electron systems using numerical Dirac-Fock (DF) and the ﬁnite basis set expansion (FBSE)
method [9–21]. The numerical atomic DF self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF) calculation is more compact and accurate but
its extension to molecular systems (multi-center many-electron systems) is cumbersome. Moreover, the generation of
virtual orbital is tedious and frequently encounters convergence diﬃculties. The FBSE method, on the other hand, is
rather simple and its extension to molecules is straightforward. Also, the generation of occupied and virtual orbitals
do not require separate computations.

The success of the relativistic FBSE method lies in its proper imposition of kinetic-balance condition [22] between
the large and small component spinor which in essence can be regarded as a proper boundary condition upon the basis
set. Several papers by Grant et al. [13] and Parpia et al [23] among others document the success of the relativistic
FBSE method. However, in their ﬁnite basis set calculation for light to heavy atoms (Z=2-50 and 80), Grant et
al. [13] employed kinetically balanced Slater-type orbitals (STOs) which have the correct functional behavior but
are particularly unsuitable for analytical self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF) molecular calculations. Gaussian type orbitals
(GTOs) or contracted Gaussian type orbitals (CGTO), on the other hand, are suitable in the evaluation of multi-
center integrals in molecules. It was shown by Ishikawa et al. [24] that GTOs can give rise to a natural description of
the relativistic wave-functions within a ﬁnite nucleus.

The most important feature of the FBSE method in STO [exp(−ζr)] or GTO [exp(−ζr2)] framework is to determine
the appropriate exponential parameter ζ, because the quality of the wave-function largely depends upon this parameter

and in recent years there has been an increased interest in ﬁnding out the appropriate exponential parameter and
contraction coeﬃcients (for CGTO) that can provide correct functional behavior of the relativistic wave-functions at
the nucleus [15,25–28]. For instance, Matsuoka et al. [26] have reported accurate conﬁguration average DF energies
for various atoms through the FBSE method using kinetically balanced well-tempered basis set in the framework
ﬁnite nuclear size approximation. While Matsuoka et al. [26] used a well-tempered Gaussian basis set in computing
DF energies, Clementi et al. [15] employed kinetically balanced geometric-type exponent for the Gaussian primitives
and obtained DF energies for various atoms that are comparable to the numerical DF value [29]. Later Malli et
al. [28] reported all-electron ab-initio fully relativistic DF and DF-Breit calculations for polyatomic systems using a
relativistic universal Gaussian basis set and recently Pernpointer et al. [27] employed a relativistic CGTO basis set
in their relativistic coupled cluster calculation for the nuclear quadrupole moment of CsF. Though the slater (STO)
and Gaussian (GTO) types of basis functions are most widely used in atomic many-body calculations, this choice is,
in principle, arbitrary. Since, it is beyond the scope of this present work to discuss this aspect at length, we refer the
review articles by Grant [30] and Sapirstein [31] for details.

We have developed a numerical procedure to solve the atomic relativistic DF-SCF equations using the FBSE method.
This new approach is basically a hybrid of numerical and analytical DF (FBSE) methods. Here, the large and small
component radial functions are expanded in terms of Gaussian primitives on a grid using appropriate constraints
on the small component radial basis to impose the kinetic-balance condition. While the large and small component
part of the radial functions are generated (on a grid) through the FBSE procedure, the one- and two-electron radial
integrals are evaluated numerically to avoid the complicated analytical expressions for the two-electron direct and
exchange radial integrals (the analytical evaluation of one electron radial integral is rather straight forward). This is
the part which diﬀers from the conventional FBSE method for solving DF-SCF or HF-SCF equations. This procedure
(numerical computation of two-electron integrals) also provides an easy way to reduces the N ∗ (N + 1)/2 operations
to Nc operations (N and Nc corresponds to the number of basis set and occupied orbitals, respectively) in DF-SCF
computation, and, thereby reduces the computational time of relativistic self-consistent ﬁeld calculations for heavy
atoms. In the perturbative computations of ground and excited state properties, the two-electron radial integrals are
also directly computed (numerically) wherever they appear to avoid the two-electron integral storage problem. In
this paper, we present some pilot calculations of the ionization potentials and excitation energies of alkali-metal and
elements of group IIIA computed through second order MBPT using relativistic wave-functions obtained from the
hybrid DF-SCF approach.

In Sec. II, we describe the hybrid DF-SCF method that has been used to generate the relativistic single-particle
atomic orbitals for post-Dirac-Fock computations. Sec. III brieﬂy reviews the background of the MBPT approach for
computing ionization potentials (IP), electron aﬃnities (EA) and excitation energies (EE). The numerical results are
presented in Sec. IV and compared with other perturbative calculations where available. We make some concluding
remarks in Sec. V.

With these deﬁnitions, it can be easily shown that the application of the variation principle to Eq. (2.3) leads to
a coupled integro-diﬀerential equations in Pnκ(r) and Qnκ(r). Therefore, to obtain the numerical wave-functions, we
have to solve these two coupled integro-diﬀerential equations. Alternatively, a pseudo-eigenvalue equation (Hartree-
Fock-Roothan) [32] can be obtained by using an analytic expansion-type wave-functions and minimizing the energy
functionals E with respect to the expansion coeﬃcients.

It has been found that the numerical wave-functions have more accurate asymptotic behavior than the analytical
ones, though both provide total energies of comparable accuracy. The accuracy of the total energy and wave-function
obtained through the Dirac-Fock-Roothan equation (FBSE method) can in principle be enhanced to any degree
by increasing the number of basis functions, but in reality only a ﬁnite number of basis can be used because the
computational time increases very rapidly with the increasing number of basis functions. Moreover, the use of large
basis functions severely impedes the eﬃciency of the post-Dirac-Fock computations.

In the present paper, we introduce a hybrid scheme to solve the DF equation through the pseudo-eigenvalue approach
where basis functions are deﬁned on a grid and one- and two-electron radial integrals are evaluated numerically as
opposed to the conventional relativistic Hartree-Fock-Roothan equations. Since, the basis functions are deﬁned on a
grid and the matrix elements appearing in the relativistic Hartree-Fock-Roothan equations are evaluated numerically,
this scheme can be regarded as a combination of numerical and analytical approach to the solution of DF-SCF
equation. Here, like the traditional analytical basis set expansion approach, the large and small components of the
radial wave-functions are expressed as linear combination of basis functions, i.e.,

where the summation index p runs over the number of basis functions N , gL
κp(r) are basis functions belonging
to the large and small components, respectively, and CL
κp are the corresponding expansion coeﬃcients.
Though, any basis functions can be used, we have chosen Gaussian-type of orbitals (GTOs) that has the following

Using the above deﬁnitions, the Dirac-Fock-Roothan equation for closed shell system can be cast into a pseudo-
eigenvalue equation of the form

where F is the Fock matrix and S, C and ǫ are overlap, eigenvector and eigenvalue matrices, respectively. This
pseudo-eigenvalue equation is ﬁrst transformed into an eigenvalue equation F ′C′ = C′ǫ, which on diagonalization
produces the desired eigenvalues (ǫ) and eigenvectors (C = S−1/2C′). Since, the detailed derivation of relativistic
Hartree-Fock-Roothan equation and its matrix elements (analytical as well as numerical form) has been discussed in
details by several authors [9,13], we conclude this section by reiterating that the DF matrix elements appearing in the
hybrid relativistic Hartree-Fock- Roothan equations are evaluated numerically to avoid the evaluation of complicated
analytical expression of two-electron matrix elements and to improve the accuracy of the orbital properties. The
present procedure also provides an easy route to implement Nc (Nc speciﬁes the number of occupied orbitals) opera-
tions instead of N 2 (N denotes the number of basis functions) for the evaluation of the two-electron radial integrals
that appear in DF-SCF equation. A brief outline of the scheme is the following:

In the SCF procedure, the integrals and the matrices are evaluated over the members of the basis set {φµ} rather
than over the members of the set of solutions {ψi} because the atomic or molecular orbitals (solutions of SCF
equations) are not known until the calculation is complete. Since these two sets of functions are related by

the two-electron matrix element of F (the Hartree-Fock potential term) in {φ} basis can be written as

Uij =

|φjψci ≡

|φj φν i

which involves a two-index tranformation. However, this two-index transformation process can be easily avoided
by evaluating the Uij matrix elements in a mixed basis i.e., in {φ, ψ} basis. This is trivial, because the occupied
orbitals can be updated (like density matrix) during the SCF iteration and, therefore, the two-electron matrix element
hφiψc| 1
r12 |φjψci can be directly computed at each iteration without invoking two two-index transformation.

III. THEORY

A. Overview of multi-reference MBPT method

Multi-reference many-body perturbation theory (MR-MBPT) may be regarded as a reformulation of the exact
Schr¨odinger equation into a small reference space that is subspace of the full Hilbert space. This reduction is achieved
by ﬁrst separating the atomic or molecular orbitals into three sets: the core {c}, valence {v} and the excited orbitals
{e} and then by introducing projection operators P for the reference space (also called valence or model space) and
Q for its orthogonal complement or virtual space,

Xm=d+1

where the sets {α} and {m} are, respectively, reference and complementary space functions and d is the dimensionality
of the reference space. With the aid of these two projectors, the exact N-electron time-independent Schr¨odinger
equation can be transformed into the equation

involving the eﬀective Hamiltonian Hef f ,

Hef f |Ψ0

λi = E|Ψ0
λi

Hef f = P HP + P HQ(E − QHQ)−1QHP

where H is the exact Hamiltonian, Hef f acts only on the reference space spanned by {α} and produces the exact
eigenvalues E for the selected states as given by the full-space Schr¨odinger equation.

Certain approximations are necessary to solve Eq. (3.4) since the right hand side involves the unknown eigenvalue E
and Q space states, which, in principle are of inﬁnite dimension. The expansion of the denominator about the zeroth
order eigenvalue transforms the Brillouin-Wigner type Hef f [Eq. (3.4) to the Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger type eﬀective
Hamiltonian (Hef f )

Hef f = P HP + P HQ(E0 − H0)−1QHP + · · ·

The exact Hamiltonian H is partitioned into H0 (the zeroth order Hamiltonian) and V (the perturbation), where
the zeroth order Hamiltonian is taken to be diagonal in P and Q subspaces, and may be written as a sum of diagonal
one-electron operators h0 deﬁned by

h0 =

ǫi|iihi|

Xi

where i runs over all orbitals and ǫi is the ith orbital energy. The partitioning of the orbitals must ensure a well-
deﬁned separation of the orbital energies between core, valence and excited orbitals. Failure to meet this requirement
introduces numerical instabilities into the perturbative computations. Although, in the above we have chosen the
zeroth order energy to be the ”sum over orbitals”, this choice is in principle, at our disposal, and in practice, it
strongly aﬀects the convergence properties of the perturbative expansions. There are two general categories known
as the generalized M¨oller-Plesset (MP) [33] and the generalized Epstein-Nesbet (EN) partitioning scheme [34]. The
generalized MP partitioning utilizes a ”sum over orbitals” treatment, whereas the generalized EN pursues a ”sum
over states” formulation in constructing the zeroth order Hamiltonian H0. Diﬀerent potentials may also be invoked to
construct H0 and a wide range of potentials have been chosen [4,5] with varying degrees of success. The Hartree-Fock
potential is the most widely used potential for MBPT computations, because many terms automatically vanish for
this particular choice. The present second order MBPT computation employs MP partitioning where the zeroth order
energy is constructed from the Hartree-Fock potential.

B. Relativistic many-body perturbation theory

partitioned into H = H0 + V , where

Here, we have introduced an r-dependent nuclear charge to account for the ﬁnite size of the nucleus which can provide

where the single-particle operator U (ri) is introduced to account the eﬀective (or average) potential experienced by an
electron due to the presence of other electrons and is known as the Hartree-Fock potential. The Schr¨odinger equation
of the zeroth order Hamiltonian H0 provides a set of orbitals that are ﬁrst partitioned into core, valence and excited
orbitals and then two projectors P and Q are introduced to cast the N-electron Schr¨odinger equation into an eﬀective
Hamiltonian equation [Eq. (3.5)]. Finally, the eﬀective Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized to obtained the desired
eigenvalues. [ Note that while carrying out relativistic MBPT calculations, negative energy states are excluded from
sum over intermediate states (|mi) to avoid continuum dissolution.]

The theoretical ionization process is usually described as M → M + +e. However, the ionization process may also
be represented as M + + e → M . That is to say, ionization potential can be computed either by estimating the
energy required to remove an electron (IP) from the neutral atomic or molecular system or evaluating the energy
released during the electron attachment process (EA) to its positively charged counterpart. Though, in principle the
computed energies will be the same, but in practice the theoretical treatment these two processess are not equally
convenient. For alkali-metal atoms or systems with one electron in the outermost shell, it is convenient to estimate
the ionization potential by computing the energy released due to the addition of an electron to its positively charged
species (a closed shell core). It is to be emphasized that although theoretically, the above two processes should provide
identical numbers, but for a truncated many-body calculation they need not be the same, because the orbitals and
their corresponding energies are not identical in these two situations. In the ﬁrst case the core and virtual orbitals
experiences the potential due to the valence electron (singly occupied orbital), but this potential is not present in the
second case.

The second quantized representation of electron attachment process to a closed shell core is:

Here |0i and |Φ0i represents the true and closed-shell vacuum state, respectively. Operators a†
c denote the
valence and core creation operator, respectively. For Na-like system, the core orbitals are 1s1/2, 2s1/2, 2p1/2 and 2p3/2,
and the valence orbitals will be 3s1/2,3p1/2 and 3p3/2. For convenience, we introduce the notation α, β, γ, · · · for core
orbitals, p, q, r, · · · for excited orbitals, u, v, w, · · · for valence and m, n for valence and/or excited orbitals.

A. Ionization potentials of neutral alkali metal atoms and group IIIA elements.

IV. RESULTS

We present the ionization potentials (IP) of alkali-metal atoms computed through second order MBPT in Table I
and compare with experiments [35] and with the second order perturbative calculations of Johnson et al. [19]. The
only diﬀerence between these two theoretical calculations lie in the choice of basis functions (apart from the dimension
of the basis function). While Johnson et al. generate the basis through the B-spline method, we employ geometric-
Gaussian function (with α0 = 0.0052 and β = 2.75) to construct the atomic orbital basis. The entire computation is
performed with a basis that ranges from 20s15p15d15f (for Lithium) to 28s24p20d16f 10g (for Francium).

Table I clearly demonstrates that the accuracy in the ionization potential estimated through Koopmans’ theorem
(KT) [36] of alkali-metal atoms decreases with increasing atomic number. For instance, the Koopman ionization
potential for s1/2 state starts oﬀ with an accuracy of 1% for 2s1/2 state of Lithium and ﬁnally ends up with 12% for
7s1/2 state of Francium. We also observe similar trends for p1/2 and p3/2 states, where separation between p1/2 and
p3/2 states increases (degenerate in Lithium) with increasing atomic number.

Apart from Sodium, inclusion of the second order MBPT terms (relaxation and correlation contribution) signif-
icantly improves the agreement with the experiment, especially for the heavy alkalis. While the accuracy of our
computed ionization potential for lighter atoms is similar to that of Johnson et al. [19], the accuracy in the estimated
IP for heavy atoms (Cesium and Francium) is better than theirs. In particular, our computed IP values for Cesium
are comparable to CCSD (coupled cluster calculation with singles and doubles) of Eliav et al. [20]. This small but
non-negligible diﬀerence in computed IP for Cesium and Francium between our results and that of Johnson et al.
clearly is a basis set eﬀect. However, it should be noted that while pursuing higher order MBPT calculations, the use
of such a large basis will be highly computer intensive unless some deep-lying core and high-lying virtual orbitals are
discarded from the calculations.

Table II compares the ionization potentials of group IIIA elements computed through second order MBPT with
the experiments [35]. We found several interesting features for this series. First of all, unlike the alkali-metal atoms
the Koopmans’ IP values do not change appreciably down the series. Secondly, the second order MBPT provides less
accurate IP value for these elements compared the alkali-metal atoms. The deviation in computed IP values for these
elements is quite expected because the non-dynamical correlation eﬀects are quite large for these elements due to the
quasi-degeneracy of the highest lying occupied orbitals. For example, the 2s1/2, 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 orbitals of Boron are
quasi-degenerate and hence, a MR-MBPT (multi-reference many-body perturbation theory) treatment is absolutely
necessary for this system to improve the accuracy and low order perturbative convergence rate.

7

Generally, the theoretical treatment of the electron attachment process is diﬃcult because the correlation and
relaxation eﬀects tend to cancel each other (See Fig. 1) and the success of the theoretical treatment depends upon
the relative importance of these two eﬀects. For alkali-metal atoms, the relaxation eﬀect is small compared to the
correlation eﬀect (especially for heavy alkalis) and, hence, they don’t cancel each other. Fig. 1 also illustrates that
while the contribution from the relaxation part is small and roughly the same for all the alkalis beyond Sodium, the
correlation contribution steadily increases with the increasing atomic number. This pattern, however, may change
at higher order MBPT and ,in fact, it has also been observed by Johnson et al. [19].
It is also evident from the
Table I that correlation and relaxation eﬀects are important for inner orbitals which indicates that the contribution
of correlation and relaxation term will be large for deep lying core orbitals. The precise estimation of correlation and
relaxation eﬀects for the deep lying (or inner) core, therefore, requires higher order many-body eﬀects and, hence, it is
imperative that high order perturbative computations (like the coupled cluster method) is necessary for the accurate
estimation of core ionization.

Here, the ﬁrst two terms of the right hand side of Eq. (4.2) corresponds to the matrix elements for electron attachment
and detachment processes and the next two terms corresponds to two-body eﬀective interaction for excitation process.
In Eq. (4.2) the last sum excludes γ = α and p = r. However, the computation of excitation energies for alkali-metal
atoms involving the highest singly occupied (at Dirac-Fock level) is rather simple, because the eﬀective two-body
interactions do not appear. For example, the 2s1/2 → 2p1/2 transition process for Lithium atom can be expressed as

|Φ2p1/2 i = |1s22p1/2i = a†

2p1/2 a2s1/2|1s22si = a†

2p1/2 a2s1/2 a†

2s1/2|1s2i ≡ a†

2p1/2 |1s2i

Therefore, the 2s1/2 → 2p1/2 transition energy through second order MBPT reduces to

∆E2s1/2→2p1/2 = hΦ2p1/2 |H (2)

ef f |Φ2p1/2i − hΦ2s1/2 |H (2)

ef f |Φ2s1/2i
2p1/2 |1s2i − h1s2|a2s1/2 H (2)

ef f a†

≡ h1s2|a2p1/2 H (2)

ef f a†

2s1/2 |1s2i

A careful analysis shows that the quantity on the right hand side of Eq. (4.4) is nothing but the diﬀerence in ionization
potential value (in terms of neutral Lithium atom) or diﬀerence in electron aﬃnity value (in terms of positively charged
Lithium atom). Therefore, once the valence ionization potentials are known for these alkali-metal atoms, the excitation
energies involving highest singly occupied orbital (at the Dirac-Fock level) can be easily evaluated by computing the
diﬀerence in ionization potential value.

Excitation energies and oscillator strengths computed through second order MBPT (using second order energy and
unperturbed dipole matrix element) for alkali-metal atoms and group IIIA elements are compared with the experiment
[37] in Tables III and IV. These tables demonstrate that the second order MBPT estimates the s1/2 → p1/2 transition
energies more accurately than s1/2 → p3/2 for alkali-metal atoms. Here, we also ﬁnd that the error in the estimation
of s1/2 → s1/2 transition energies are less (on an average) compared to s1/2 → p1/2 and s1/2 → p3/2 for alkali-metal
atoms. While the second order single reference MBPT provides an accurate estimate for the excited states of alkali-
metal atoms, it yields somewhat inaccurate (compared to alkali-metal atoms) excited state energies for the group IIIA

elements. This deviation in the estimation of the excitation energies for elements of group IIIA is not unexpected,
since the highest occupied s and p orbitals are fairly close-lying for these elements, conﬁgurations like ns2np(J = 1/2)
and np3(J = 1/2) interact strongly with eachother [38]. Therefore, these two conﬁguration state functions (CSFs)
should be included in the reference space for an accurate description of the ground and excited states. In other words,
a multi-reference MBPT treatment is necessary for an accurate description of the ground and excited states for these
elements. Since our second order single reference space MBPT for the ground and excited state energy computations
do not treat the CSF np3 as a reference space states, these CSFs act as an intruder states [39], and, thereby aﬀect
the perturbative convergence. An extensive study of this problem is underway.

V. CONCLUSION

We have presented valence ionization potentials, excitation energies and oscillator strengths of alkali-metal atoms
and group IIIA elements computed through single reference (SR) second order MBPT where the single particle orbitals
are generated by solving the Dirac-Fock Hamiltonian in a ﬁnite Gaussian basis. Since, the present procedure computes
the one and two-electron radial integrals numerically by deﬁning the atomic orbitals on a grid, it is easy to implement
≈ Nc dependence (Nc= No. of occupied orbitals) for the number of operations needed to evaluate the two-electron
integrals that appears in Dirac-Fock self-consistent ﬁeld equation. The numerical accuracy, achieved for single valence
electron atoms promises that this hybrid method will be accurate for other many-electron atomic systems and with
some modiﬁcations, can also be applied to molecular systems.

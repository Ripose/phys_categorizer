Abstract

Inversionless gain is observed in a V-type inhomogeneously broadened system without

introducing any incoherent pumping and only by changing the collisional dephasing decay

rate. In this system sub-Doppler linewidth is achieved with oﬀ-resonance pump detuning.

I. Introduction:

Over the last few years, atomic coherence eﬀect such as coherent population trapping(CPT)

[1,2], electromagnetically induced transparency(EIT) [3-5], gain without inversion(GWI) and its

companion, lasing without inversion (LWI) [6-8], enhancement of refractive index [9,10], line nar-

rowing [11] etc have been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally due to their

multiple applications in various ﬁelds. The area of application has a range from laser cooling

to isotope separation and from ultrahigh-sensitive magnetometers to slowing down of light pulse

[12,13]. One of the most potential applications of the atomic coherence is to extend the con-

ventional laser sources to ultra-violet and possibly X-rays and even Gamma-ray spectral range,

where the conventional methods based on population inversion are not available or are diﬃcult to

implement. This is performed through the conversion of incoherent energy into coherent light by

a technique known as LWI [6]. In any commonly considered basis the ampliﬁcation without inver-

sion occurs due to the quantum interference between the two dressed-states created by the strong

pump ﬁeld [14]. The line shape of the probe absorption of a three level system is controlled by the

four diﬀerent contributions, among them two are absorptive and other two are dispersive contri-

butions [15]. The absorptive contribution is always positive where as the dispersive contribution

is positive or negative depending upon the type of the scheme considered.

Most of the theoretical and experimental work on EIT and LWI are performed on three

level systems(TLS) in the V, lambda(Λ) and cascade(Ξ) schemes. This is because these types of

systems are easily available in various atomic samples such as Rb, Na, Cs etc. In recent years, EIT

in Doppler broadened media has been observed experimentally using cw lasers as coupling lasers

[16-18]. Recently Ahuﬁnger et al [19] proposed an experiment for obtaining 0.4 % inversionless
gain in a cascade type TLS system applicable to cold free 87Rb atoms. Wu et al [20] have

studied gain with or without inversion in a V-type system with two near degenerate excited levels

driven by a strong pump and a weak probe ﬁeld. They found that, due to quantum interference

between two spontaneous decay channels, even in the absence of an incoherent pumping the

probe gain is achieved. Boon et al [21] predicted an inversionless gain in a V-type mismatched

Doppler-broadened medium and made a comparison on inversionless gain between matched and

mismatched systems.

In this article, we report gain without inversion in a Doppler-broadened

V-type system without introducing any incoherent pumping. An analytical expression(ﬁrst order

in probe Rabi-frequency) of probe transition is obtained by solving the density matrix equations.

We observed the gain without inversion via electromagnetically induced transparency in a Doppler

broadened system. We observe that the signiﬁcant EIT window is produced for a pump Rabi-

frequency greater than the homogeneous but much less than the Doppler width. We also observe

that EIT window crosses the zero line (Fig. 4(a)) with decreasing level dephasing rate(Γ32). Oﬀ
resonance pump detuning gives linewidth narrowing phenomenon for the V-type system.

Non zero pump detuning gives an asymmetry in A-T doublet, the position of the A-T peaks

can be found from the pole structure of the Equ(9). The real part of the pole structure gives the

position of the resonance and the imaginary part represents the resonance width. The position of

the resonances are

So for ∆1 >> χ1 the peak at ∆2 = ( ∆1

To obtain the probe absorption in a Doppler broadened system the Doppler broadening

should be taken into account. For this purpose Equ(9) should be integrated over the whole velocity

III. Numerical calculation and results:

We study the absorption and dispersion signals of the probe transition in a Doppler broad-
ened background for various values of (i) pump Rabi-frequencies(χ1) (ii) Doppler width(Wd
HWHM) and (iii) Γ32. In Fig. 2 Electromagnetically Induced Transparency(EIT) is observed in a
Doppler broadened back-ground with increasing pump Rabi-frequency. For numerical calculation

in Fig. 2 we take the values of all population decay rates(Γij) as equal to 6 MHz and Wd = 280
MHz and in all the ﬁgures the probe Rabi-frequency(χ2) is taken as 0.6 MHz. Here pump ﬁeld is
2 > transition. At zero value of pump ﬁeld(χ1 = 0) a
held on-resonance(∆1 = 0) with
Doppler broadened probe absorption signal is obtained(dotted curve in Fig. 2(a)). With increasing

1 >

|

pump ﬁeld intensity the absorption of the probe signal on the line center vanishes(solid curve of

Fig. 2(a)) due to the quantum interference between the dressed states created by strong pump

ﬁeld[4]. As the probe absorption is cancelled in the line center the probe dispersion is increas-

ing(solid curve of Fig. 2(b)) that means the system becomes more dispersive the phenomenon is

known as EIT.

1) is broadened by the same factor. We study this phenomena for various value
of Doppler width(Wd) starting from 20 MHz (dotted curve of Fig. 3(a)) to 280 MHz(solid curve
of Fig. 3(a)) with a oﬀ-resonance pump detuning(∆1) equal to 100 MHz and χ1 = 60 MHz.

For a pump ﬁeld Rabi-frequency(χ1) = 60 MHz on-resonance with

To observe it we decrease the value of Γ32 from 6 MHz(dotted curve of Fig. 4(a)) to zero(solid
curve of Fig. 4(a)) at an interval of 2 MHz. It is seen from the ﬁgure that with reduction of Γ32
EIT window increases and gain is achieved(equ.12). It is clear that collisional dephasing changes

the nature of the spectrum. A Rabi-like side band structure is observed in the gain proﬁle equally

spaced about the line center due to the split of ground state level. This type of splitting was

previously observed in V-type system [26,27,21]. We study the eﬀect of Doppler broadening on

gain proﬁle and observed that with increasing Doppler width(Wd) gain is decreases. The GWI

predicted in this work may be observed for sodium D1 transition (S 1
= 1, 2 [28] where the decay rate Γ32 will be negligible.

IV. Conclusions:

In this work we have presented the role of collisional dephasing and oﬀ-resonance pump

detuning in a V-type Doppler broadened system in presence of a strong pump or coupling ﬁeld.

Recently Wu et al [24] observed how the coherent hole burning phenomena in a Λ-type Doppler

broadened system change with atomic collision rate. Here we observed the probe transmission get
ampliﬁed(Im(ρ1
13) > 0) with decreasing Γ32 and the maximum ampliﬁcation is observed when Γ32
= 0. So it is seen that collisional dephasing act to reduce the eﬀects of quantum coherence. In

a V-type system if the upper levels are closely spaced then we can not ignore Γ32 but if they are
well spaced then we can ignore it.

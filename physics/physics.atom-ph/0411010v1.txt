Abstract. The invention of laser cooling methods for neutral atoms allows
optical and magnetic trapping of cold atomic clouds in the temperature regime
below 1mK. In the past, light-assisted cold collisions between laser cooled atoms
have been widely studied in magneto-optical atom traps (MOTs). We describe
interactions, speciﬁcally cold collisions,
here theoretical studies of dynamical
between atoms trapped in near-resonant, dissipative optical
lattices. The
extension of collision studies to the regime of optical lattices introduces several
complicating factors. For lattice studies, one has to account for the internal
substates of atoms, position dependent matter-light coupling, and position
dependent couplings between the atoms, in addition to the spontaneous decay of
electronically excited atomic states. The developed quantum-mechanical model
combines atomic cooling and collision dynamics in a single framework. The model
is based on Monte Carlo wave-function simulations and is applied when the lattice-
creating lasers have frequencies both below (red-detuned lattice) and above (blue-
detuned lattice) the atomic resonance frequency. It turns out, that the radiative
heating mechanism aﬀects the dynamics of atomic cloud in a red-detuned lattice
in a way that is not directly expected from the MOT studies. The optical lattice
and position dependent light-matter coupling introduces selectivity of collision
partners. Atoms, which are most mobile and energetic, are strongly favored to
participate in collisions, and are more often ejected from the lattice, than the
slow ones in the laser parameter region selected for study. Consequently, the
atoms remaining in the lattice have a smaller average kinetic energy per atom
than in the case of non-interacting atoms. For blue-detuned lattices, we study
how optical shielding emerges as a natural part of the lattice and look for ways to
optimize the eﬀect. We ﬁnd that cooling and shielding dynamics do not mix and
it is possible to achieve eﬃcient shielding with a very simple arrangement. The
simulations are computationally very demanding and would obviously beneﬁt from
the simpliﬁcation schemes. We present some steps to this direction by showing
how it is possible to calculate collision rates in near-resonant lattices in a fairly
simple way. The method can then be used to combine quantum-mechanical and
semiclassical models for cold collision studies in optical lattices.

1. Introduction

2

It has been known for a long time that light can exert a force on material objects.
The ﬁrst experiments which showed the eﬀect of the radiation pressure of an
electromagnetic ﬁeld on matter predicted by Maxwell were done at the beginning of
the last century [1]. Since then, the success of applying the light force in a controlled
way to cool gaseous atomic clouds to temperatures around, and even below, the µK
range has given huge impetus to the ﬁeld of cold atomic physics.

Laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms has been a very rapidly developing
ﬁeld of physics since the mid-eighties when experimentalists succeeded for the ﬁrst
time to optically trap laser cooled atoms [2]. More recent milestones include
the experimental realizations of atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) [3], Fermi
degenerate dilute quantum gas [4], superﬂuid–Mott-insulator phase transition in
optical lattices [5], molecular BEC [6], and evidence for superﬂuidity in an atomic
Fermi gas [7].

In general, the slow motion of the laser cooled atoms changes drastically the
collision dynamics of atoms compared to room temperature gases. The collisions may
become inelastic and the research on cold collisions in magneto-optical traps (MOTs)
has shown how the collisions consequently limit the densities and temperatures of
atomic gases in MOTs [8, 9]. The purpose of this article is to describe and review
the work which has been done to extend the regime of cold collision studies to optical
lattices.

This tutorial gives a simple introduction to one speciﬁc cooling and trapping
scheme for neutral atoms: near-resonant, dissipative optical lattices, and concentrates
on the description of light-assisted cold collisions in this system. A thorough
introduction into the ﬁeld of laser cooling, trapping, and optical lattices can be found
from a text book [10], various review articles [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], and
summer school lecture notes [19, 20, 21]. Cold collision theories and experiments are
reviewed in detail in Refs. [8, 9, 22].

The article is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a short introduction to near-
resonant, dissipative optical lattices. We describe both red- and blue-detuned lattices.
The latter are sometimes in the literature referred also as gray or dark optical lattices
due to the reduced number of scattered photons compared to ”bright” red-detuned
optical lattices. Section 3 describes the basic cold collision mechanisms in the presence
of a near-resonant light, radiative heating by red-detuned light and optical shielding
by blue-detuned light. Section 4 shows a formulation of the cold collision problem
in optical lattices and overviews the central results. Finally, we conclude with a few
remarks in Section 5.

2. Optical lattices

Disordered cold atomic gas can be arranged into an ordered structure by periodic
optical potentials which are created with suitably chosen set of interfering laser beams
[12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. An optical lattice formed by optical potentials does not only
trap the atoms, but it is also able to cool them via optical pumping and Sisyphus
mechanism. During the cooling period, the atoms lose enough kinetic energy to
be trapped and eventually localize into the optical lattice sites [23, 24]. The key
ingredient for creating periodic dissipative optical lattice is the polarization gradient
of the standing laser ﬁeld and the consequent periodic coupling between the atoms

and the light.

The typical temperature range for alkali metal atoms cooled and trapped in
optical lattices falls between the so called Doppler limit Td and recoil limit Tr. The
Doppler limit gives lower bound for Doppler cooling, the main cooling mechanism in
MOTs, and can be written as

where ¯h is Planck’s constant h divided by 2π, Γ the atomic linewidth, and kB
Boltzmann’s constant. The recoil
limit in turn describes the lower bound for
polarization gradient cooling mechanisms, and Tr corresponds to the amount of energy
of single photon absorption or emission recoil, and is given by

Here kr is the wavenumber of the cooling lasers, and M the mass of an atom. The
corresponding energy unit

Td = ¯hΓ/2kB,

Tr = (¯hkr)

/M kB.

/2M,

is consequently called recoil energy. A typical alkali element used for laser cooling,
Cs, has Td = 120µK and Tr = 0.2µK.

Modern work on optical lattices was preceded by the proposal of Letokhov to trap
cold atoms in one dimension by using a standing light wave [25], and accompanied by
the experiment of Burns et al. who created crystal structures of microscopic dielectric
objects suspended in liquid by standing light waves [26]. Because of the purity and
ease of control in optical lattices, the trapped atoms are almost ideal for the study
of phenomena which are familiar from solid-state physics. A few examples of these
phenomena, which have been realized in experiments, include Bragg scattering [27, 28],
Bloch oscillations [29], and Wannier-Stark ladders [30]. Other interesting observations
include the quantum Zeno eﬀect [31] and dynamical tunneling [32]. During the last
few years, the amount of research exploiting optical lattices has hugely increased. This
is mainly because now it is possible to load far-oﬀ resonant optical lattices with Bose-
Einstein condensates (BECs). This has led to the observation of superﬂuid–Mott-
insulator phase transition in far-detuned optical lattices [5] which paved the way e.g.
to the creation of multiparticle entanglement by exploiting controlled collisions [33].
For dissipative optical lattices, a so called double lattice creates interesting prospects
for the future studies [34]. In a double lattice, the atoms on two ground hyperﬁne
states can be trapped and moved in a controllable way with respect to each other. This
opens a new avenue to study inelastic cold collisions in the presence of near-resonant
light in dissipative lattices.

2.1. Red-detuned dissipative optical lattices

The simplest case of Sisyphus cooling and optical lattices can be described by using
the atomic level structure with the ground state angular momentum Jg = 1/2 and the
excited state Je = 3/2 [23]. A single atom has two ground state sublevels
g±1/2 > and
|
four excited state sublevels
e±1/2 >, where the half–integer subscripts
e±3/2 > and
|
|
indicate the quantum number m of the angular momentum along the z direction.
This is shown in Fig. 1 with the appropriate squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients
which describe the relative strengths of the light-induced couplings between the various
levels.

Figure 1. The level structure of a single atom for a red-detuned lattice. The
squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients for various transitions are shown, and
the laser frequency ωL is typically detuned few atomic linewidths below the atomic
resonance frequency ω0 for eﬃcient Sisyphus cooling. The detuning of the laser
is described by δ = ωL − ω0.

2.1.1. Sisyphus cooling The laser ﬁeld consists of two counter–propagating beams
along the z-axis with orthogonal linear polarizations and with frequency ωL. The total
ﬁeld has a polarization gradient in one dimension and reads (with suitable choices of
phases of the beams and origin of the coordinate system)

E(z, t) =

0(exeikr z

ieye−ikr z)e−iωLt + c.c.,

E

−

(4)

E

where
0 is the amplitude and kr the wavenumber. With this ﬁeld, the polarization
changes from circular σ− to linear and back to circular in the opposite direction σ+
when z changes by λL/4 where λL is the wavelength of the lasers. See Fig. 2 for the
points of pure circular polarization with the corresponding lattice wells.

The periodic polarization gradient of the laser ﬁeld is reﬂected in the periodic
light shifts, i.e., AC–Stark shifts, of the atomic sublevels creating the optical lattice
structure. The relative strengths of the couplings between a single ground state
sublevel and various excited state sublevels vary spatially according to the polarization
of the light ﬁeld due to unequal values of the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients for diﬀerent
transitions. This induces position dependent light shifts and produces a periodic
optical potential structure such that the shape of the light-induced potentials is the
same for the two ground state sublevels, but the potentials are shifted spatially with
respect to each other by λL/4, see Fig. 2. The top of the optical potential for one
sublevel coincides with the bottom of the other one.

When the atomic motion occurs in a suitable velocity range, optical pumping
of the atom between the ground state sublevels reduces the kinetic energy of the
atom [23]. Because of the position dependent transfer rates between the substates,
the optical pumping to another ground state sublevel tends to occur when the atom is
near the top of the optical potential. The atom is transferred to the bottom of another
potential via the excited state, due to spontaneous emission and a consequent quantum
jump. The subsequently emitted photon has a larger energy than the absorbed one,
and the kinetic energy of the atom is therefore reduced, and the atom is cooled. After
several such cooling cycles the atom localizes into an optical potential well, i.e., into
an optical lattice site. Figure 3 shows the optical pumping cycles between the ground
state sublevels cooling an atom, and the oscillations of the atomic wave packet after
localization into an optical lattice site.

2.1.2. Localization in lattice When the steady state is reached after a certain period
of cooling, atoms are, to a large extent, localized into the lattice sites. In our studies of
cold collisions with near-resonant optical lattices, the laser ﬁeld is detuned a few atomic
linewidths below [36, 37, 38] or above [39] the atomic transition. The optical lattice
is in the oscillating regime if the atom completes on average more than one oscillation
in the site before being optically pumped to a neighboring site. For less than one
average oscillation per site, the lattice is in the jumping regime. The laser parameters
Ω and δ determine in which of the regimes the lattice is in [35]. It must be noted that
tight localization and occupation of the lowest vibrational levels of a periodic lattice
potential increases the optical pumping time, and the time of localization within a
single lattice site becomes longer compared to the semiclassical values [23]. Since we
are mainly interested in the case when the two atoms undergo an intra-well collision,
the chosen parameters in our work correspond to the jumping regime of the lattice.

2.2. Blue-detuned dissipative optical lattices

In red-detuned lattices atoms are trapped around those spatial space points where
the coupling between the ground and excited states has a maximum value, and

PhD Tutorial

consequently the number of scattered photons is large.
It is possible to reduce
photon scattering when the atoms are trapped around the points where the atom-
laser coupling has a minimum value. This is indeed the case when the sign of the
detuning is set to the blue side of the atomic transition, δ > 0, and, e.g., the atomic
level conﬁguration Je = Jg is used.

The original motivation for the study of the blue-detuned polarization gradient
cooling and trapping mechanisms was their ability to exploit the dark states to
increase the phase space density, either directly by reducing the unwanted eﬀects
of reabsorption of scattered photons, or by feeding the once cooled atoms to sub-
recoil cooling. The latter is possible since the blue-detuned polarization gradient and
velocity selective coherent population trapping (VSCPT) subrecoil cooling schemes
may coexist for the same atomic system [40, 41].

Two counterpropagating orthogonally polarized blue-detuned laser beams can
1.
eﬃciently cool down atoms which have the level structure Je = Jg or Je = Jg −
The lowest position-dependent eigenstate of the system is ﬂat in this case and is not
directly coupled to the light ﬁeld at any point of space. Thus, despite of the cooling,
the atoms are not trapped. The cooling works eﬃciently for atoms which have Jg > 1
since the ﬂat dark state is not an eigenstate of the momentum operator. Consequently,
the atomic motion couples the dark and non-dark states. This coupling is largest when
the two states lie energetically closest to each other. The consequence is the transfer
of the population from the dark state to the spatially modulated state in the vicinity
of the optical potential well, and subsequent Sisyphus-type cooling mechanism [14].

The obvious drawback in this case is the lack of a periodic trapping potential.
The problem can be circumvented by the use of either transverse [42] or longitudinal
[43] magnetic ﬁelds with respect to the laser propagation axis. The creation of blue-
detuned lattice by all-optical means requires the use of two excited state hyperﬁne
manifolds instead of only one [44]. We have used for collision studies the proposal of
Grynberg and Courtois with a magnetic ﬁeld along the laser axis [45].

2.2.1. Grynberg-Courtois gray optical lattice An applied longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
removes the degeneracy of the atomic states of blue-detuned optical molasses described
above, and produces the necessary spatial modulation for the optical potentials and
the lattice structure. This is easy to understand by considering the point in space
where the laser ﬁeld has a pure circular polarization. For σ+ polarized light the

ground Zeeman state mg = +Jg is not coupled to light when Je = Jg or Je = Jg −

and the same applies for mg =

where µ is the magnetic moment of the corresponding state and the magnetic ﬁeld
strength is B = Bz along the quantization axis z. The consequence is replacement of
the dark and ﬂat lowest eigenstate with the spatially modulated lattice potential.

It is easy to vary the strength of the Zeeman shift ¯hΩB with respect to the laser
induced light shift U0. Obviously the two extreme regimes are: a) the Zeeman shift is
U0, b) the light shift is small compared to

In case a), where the light shift dominates, the behavior of the lattice is
paramagnetic. With the increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength the lattice modulation
becomes deeper. In this case the atoms are trapped only to the points of σ− or σ+

polarization of the laser ﬁeld depending on the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. Due to
the opposite Zeeman shifts only one of the two circular polarization points correspond
to potential minima, and the period of the trapping potential is λ/2.

When the Zeeman shift dominates in the case b), the laser ﬁeld produces
perturbations to the Zeeman shifted states, and the situation resembles the traditional
Sisyphus cooling scheme [23]. The optical pumping between the ground sublevels cools
the atom which can be trapped in many internal states, causing an antiparamagnetic
behavior.

We have done our collision studies in this antiparamagnetic regime. See Fig. 4
for the used atomic level conﬁguration Je = Jg = 1 and Fig. 5 for the corresponding
optical lattice structure. We label the three ground state sublevels with

and the three excited state sublevels with

indicate the angular momentum projection quantum number m along z-axis. Because
the standing laser ﬁeld has only circular components, and the Clebsch-Gordan
coeﬃcient between me = 0 and mg = 0 states is zero, the atoms are rapidly pumped
to the Λ subsystem of the whole state structure; thus, in this level conﬁguration,
the atoms are trapped to the ground substates which have an angular momentum
quantum number mg =
1 and mg = +1. The excited state with me = 0 provides a
way for cooling optical pumping cycles between the two trapping ground substates.

The level structure which we have used in our studies for a blue-detuned lattice
can be found in 87Rb, which has F = 1 hyperﬁne states for both the 5S1/2 ground
state and the 5P1/2 excited state. This is actually the element and the level scheme
which has been used in the blue-detuned lattice experiment of Hemmerich et al. [42],
even though in their case the lattice structure and the orientation of the magnetic
ﬁeld diﬀers from what is presented here.

±

The reason for the choice we have made for the used level structure and an
antiparamagnetic regime of the Grynberg-Courtois lattice is in their simplicity. The
cooling mechanism resembles the traditional Sisyphus cooling, making it more relevant
to compare the results between the red and blue-detuning studies. Moreover, it is
necessary to use only three levels of the Λ-subsystem instead of all the six levels
of a single atom. Thus the number of product state basis vectors for interaction
studies between the atoms can be reduced in the blue-detuned case. This reduces the
computational resource requirements and speeds up the simulations when compared
to red-detuned case (which has to use all the six substates of a single atom for

PhD Tutorial

10

the interaction studies). Thus for blue-detuned lattices it is easier to make a wider
exploration of parameter space, if required.

2.3. Basic theoretical approaches

The essence of Sisyphus cooling is optical pumping between the various internal states
of an atom. Thus, the atom can not be treated as a simple two state system. Because
of the polarization gradients, the laser couples the multitude of Zeeman substates
of the atom in a position dependent way and the spontaneous emission caused by
the coupling to the vacuum plays a crucial role in the optical pumping process. To
describe the atomic motion in optical lattices one has to solve the problem of a multi-
level atom coupled to a monochromatic laser ﬁeld and to a quantized electromagnetic
environment in its vacuum state.

It is possible to treat the external laser ﬁeld classically since the ﬁelds which are
considered weak from the Sisyphus cooling and the lattice point of view still contain
a large number of photons. Typical laser intensities used in experiments are a few
mW/cm2. The treatment of the interaction between a classical ﬁeld and an atom is
typically done with the rotating wave approximation, which neglects the terms that
do not conserve the total energy.

The general form of the task is to solve the master equation for the density matrix

It is extremely diﬃcult to ﬁnd the exact analytical solution for this equation even
in the case of the simplest atomic level schemes used for optical lattices. One can
try to ﬁnd approximations which allow an analytical treatment, or the combination of
analytical and numerical calculations to Eq. (18). Another possibility is to simulate
the optical lattice system on a computer, especially, simulations by the Monte Carlo
wave-function (MCWF) method may provide a convenient way to obtain the solution
of Eq. (18) [46, 47, 48, 49]. In the case of laser cooling, the combinations of analytical
and numerical treatments can treat 2D case [50], but the 3D problem has been solved
so far only by MCWF simulations [51].

A common feature for analytical treatments of optical lattices is the adiabatic
elimination of the excited states, thus reducing the number of the levels in the problem
at hand [16]. One can then try to solve the master equation directly by numerical
integration, introduce further approximations, or exploit the translational symmetry
properties of the system [52].

The MCWF method was originally developed for problems in quantum optics,
where in many of the cases the direct quantum-mechanical solution of the system
density matrix is very diﬃcult or impossible to obtain. The method has been applied
e.g. to the resonance ﬂuorescence spectrum of 1D optical molasses [53] and to 3D
laser cooling [51]. For more examples, see Ref. [49]. By now the method has also been
applied outside the ﬁeld of quantum optics, e.g. into transport problems in condensed
matter physics [54]. The key idea of MCWF method is the generation of a large
number of single wave function realizations which include stochastic quantum jumps
of the system studied. The ﬁnal result for the system density matrix and the system

Figure 6. Branching of a wave packet. The time evolution of the total atomic
wave packet in position space is shown. In addition to treating spontaneous decay
in a rigorous way, the full quantum-mechanical MCWF method can also account
for the branching of the wave packet in optical lattices.

properties can then be calculated as ensemble averages of single realizations. Section
4.2 presents the method in more detail.

We have chosen for our collision studies in optical lattices the MCWF method
since it has been a widely used benchmark method for various semiclassical theories for
cold collisions in MOTs [55]. The method gives a full quantum-mechanical description
of the atomic system (the external laser ﬁeld is still described classically) and treats
spontaneous decay in a rigorous way. A semiclassical version of the Monte Carlo (MC)
method has also been developed for lattice studies [56] and has been applied e.g. to
study anisotropic velocity distributions in 3D dissipative optical lattices [57]. This
variant describes the external atomic degrees of freedom classically, and has limited
applicability when the spread of the wave packet inﬂuences the dynamics of the system.
This is the case when an atom is tightly localized into a lattice site and the spread
of the packet aﬀects essentially the optical pumping rate. Moreover, the semiclassical
approach can not treat, e.g., the branching of the wave packet in optical lattice shown
in Fig. 6. For the branching of the packets, see e.g. discussion in Ref. [58].

3. Cold collisions between laser cooled atoms in the presence of
near-resonant light

Thermal velocities of atoms in laser cooled gas are on the order of centimeters
per second, roughly four orders of magnitude less than in room temperature gas.
Consequently, the collision dynamics is strikingly diﬀerent within the two temperature
regimes. The kinetic energies involved in the cold collision process are on the order
or less than the energy of the atomic linewidth. For example, in the case of cesium
the linewidth of a typical cooling transition is 2400Er and a typical collision energy is
around 1600Er. Slow atomic motion indicates that the decay time of the excitation
becomes small compared to the time scale of the total collision dynamics. This allows
new phenomena in cold collision processes to aﬀect the thermodynamics of the cold
atomic cloud [8, 9].

A general categorization of dynamical interactions between atoms can be made
by considering collisions occurring between two ground state or between one ground
and one excited state atom. Here we describe binary collisions between atoms of

same element, i.e., a homonuclear diatomic molecule, and the emphasis is on the
collisions between a ground and an excited state atom which is the relevant scheme
for dissipative optical lattices.

In the presence of near-resonant light the excitation of a quasimolecule formed
by the colliding atoms may occur at an extremely long range, even on the order of
few thousands of Bohr radii a0. Molecular potentials at these long ranges are usually
labeled by the Hund’s case (c) notation, where the component of the total electronic
angular momentum along the internuclear axis is a good quantum number. The
electron clouds of the colliding atoms do not overlap at longe range, and the dominant
interaction between the atoms is the resonant dipole-dipole interaction. We give a
description of the resonant dipole-dipole interaction in Section 4.1, earlier calculations
for alkali-metals can be found in Refs. [59, 60].

The long range properties of molecular states and the sign of the detuning of the
laser with respect the appropriate electronic transition deﬁne the possible consequences
of collisions. A repulsive or an attractive character of the molecular potential at long
range arises due to the relative orientation of the dipole moments of the colliding
atoms. In the case of a red-detuned laser, the resonance or Condon point rc, occurs for
an attractive state. For a blue-detuned laser rc occurs for a repulsive state. Depending
on the magnitude of the detuning and the strength of the coupling laser, oﬀ-resonant
excitation to non-resonant state may also play a role [39].

A very active research ﬁeld of its own is the photoassociation of laser cooled
atoms to molecules. Photoassociation is typically done by using a large red detuning
of the laser so that free atom pair is excited at rc to a well deﬁned bound molecular
vibrational state. Especially photoassociation in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate
has attracted wide interest recently [61, 62, 63]. We will not discuss further
from
photoassociation here but the reader can ﬁnd presentations of the ﬁeld e.g.
Refs. [9, 64].

3.1. Radiative heating by red-detuned light

With red-detuned light, the population of the quasimolecule formed by the two
collision partners may get resonantly excited into an attractive excited state at the
Condon point rc (see Fig. 7). The relative velocity of the atoms increases due to the
acceleration on the attractive state until spontaneous emission terminates the process.

Figure 8. An example of a radiative heating study in MOT from Ref. [66]. Final
momentum distributions for various initially Gaussian momentum distributions
are shown. The initial momentum refers to the hpi of the narrow initial
momentum distributions. The eﬀects of radiative heating, the spreading of the
distributions, and the momentum increase is clearly visible, especially for low
initial relative momentum. For higher initial momentum some character of the
initial distribution is still preserved in the post-collision distribution.

When the atoms have again bounced apart due to the short range repulsion in the
ground state, the pair may lose some of the gained kinetic energy in the reverse process,
but to lesser degree. The overall eﬀect is the heating of the colliding pair, and the
escape of the atoms from the trap if the total gain in kinetic energy is large enough
[9].

Figure 7 shows a semiclassical (SC) schematic view of the process.

In some
of the parameter regimes SC descriptions, such as the Landau-Zener level crossing
model, can be used [55]. When the SC models fail, full quantum-mechanical methods
are needed. For example, MCWF simulations [65, 66] can be used as a benchmark
method for simpler analytical semiclassical calculations. It should be emphasized that
it is diﬃcult in SC models to account for population recycling, which means that once-
decayed population may get re-excited in strong laser ﬁelds. A comparison between
various methods and their application range is given in Ref. [55].

Most of the radiative heating studies done so far have used a simple two-state
description with one ground and one excited molecular electronic state. An example
of MCWF simulation results for MOT from Ref. [66] is shown in Fig. 8. The results
demonstrate radiative heating via the spreading of the momentum distributions.
The eﬀect clearly becomes stronger as the initial collision momentum, i.e., cloud
temperature, decreases. We emphasize that our lattice studies include many attractive
and repulsive states simultaneously, see Section 4.1.

In addition to radiative heating, atoms may also escape from the trap by the
ﬁne-structure change mechanism. If the population survives on the excited state for
small enough relative distance between the two atoms, the point where two ﬁne-
structure states have a crossing may be reached. Now, if the pair comes out from
the collision in an energetically lower ﬁne-structure state than the one in which they
entered the collision, the pair gains kinetic energy by the amount corresponding to the
ﬁne-structure splitting of the atomic electronic states at large r. This energy diﬀerence
is usually large compared to the trap depths, and consequently in this case the atoms
escape from the trap [8, 9].

Figure 9. A schematic semiclassical presentation of optical shielding. The
quasimolecule is excited resonantly to the repulsive molecular state Ue at the
Condon point rc. Then it reaches the classical turning point rtp, and is ﬁnally
transferred back to the ground state Ug when arriving at rc again. If the transfer
back to the ground state is not complete, the atom pair may gain kinetic energy
as it is further accelerated by the excited state potential. In this case shielding
is incomplete and the collision is inelastic. If the population transfer between the
states is adiabatic, shielding is complete and the collision between the atoms is
elastic.

We deal in our studies with very small detunings, a few atomic linewidths only,
and strong laser ﬁelds. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the eﬀect of ﬁne-
structure changing collisions on the cloud temperature is very small compared to
eﬀect of radiative heating processes, and we neglect the ﬁne-structure change loss
mechanism in our lattice studies. The assumption is also supported by the fact that
there can be an order of magnitude diﬀerence between the ﬁne-structure state crossing
point and rc for the small detunings we have used.

3.2. Optical shielding by blue-detuned light

When blue-detuned light is used, the resonant excitation at the Condon point occurs
to a repulsive excited quasimolecular state. This makes it possible to shield the atoms
from close encounters [9], see Fig. 9. If the shielding is eﬃcient, collisions between
atoms may become completely elastic. The mechanism would obviously be useful for
preventing loss of atoms in optical lattices formed with a near-resonant blue-detuned
light.

In an optical shielding process, resonantly excited quasimolecule population
reaches the classical turning point on the repulsive excited state and the atoms begin
to move apart again. The shielding becomes complete if all the population has been
excited, no spontaneous decay has occurred, and all the population returns resonantly
to the ground state at the Condon point. In this case, collisions become elastic (when
photon recoil eﬀects are ignored), and no heating or escape occurs due to inelastic
processes. Moreover, the ground state is emptied at a relatively long range, and no
population reaches short distances where unwanted processes are possible, such as
hyperﬁne state changing collisions. Thus, the possibility to use optical shielding in
an eﬃcient way allows to increase the occupation density of the dissipative lattice, in

PS describes the ground state population ﬂux at very short range. The dots
are results of the Monte Carlo simulations and the lines presents the results of
various semiclassical Landau-Zener approaches. When the laser ﬁeld is strong
enough, the ground state is eﬀectively emptied before the atoms have a chance to
approach close to each other. This is demonstrated by the decreasing value of PS
for increasing Rabi frequencies.

addition to the beneﬁt of reducing the rate of scattered and reabsorbed photons and
the consequent eﬀects.

In the past MCWF simulations have described the eﬃciency of the shielding
process by a shielding measure PS, which essentially describes the ﬂux of the ground
state population to the short range beyond the Condon point rc [67, 68, 69], see Fig. 10.
In the case of optical lattices, a more descriptive result is the momentum distribution
in a steady state compared between interacting and non-interacting atoms [39].

In this Section we have described radiative heating and optical shielding processes
by using the molecular state description. This is how the treatment has usually been
done in the past when studying the heating and loss of atoms in MOTs.
In our
calculations and simulations we use the two-atom product state presentation instead.
Our aim is to study the eﬀect of collisions in a near-resonant optical lattice. Most of
the photon scattering still occurs when the atoms are outside the range of a binary
interaction. It would be an unnecessary complication to describe photon scattering
and quantum jumps in a lattice by using a molecular basis. Moreover, we give a
simultaneous description for laser cooling and collision processes. Hence, in our case
the molecular basis is only used for a qualitative description of radiative heating and
optical shielding processes, but it does not appear directly in our calculations.

4. Collisions in optical lattices

In the past cold binary collisions between atoms have been widely studied under
conditions which correspond to the atoms trapped in magneto-optical traps [8, 9, 22].
Previous cold collision research has concentrated on the eﬀects of inelastic collisions
on the properties of an atomic cloud, but has neglected the co-existence of the cooling

processes.

16

We are dealing with near-resonant optical lattices, and we have combined in a
single framework the Sisyphus cooling mechanism and cold collision dynamics. Thus
our approach includes simultaneous dynamical processes of cooling, trapping, and
collisions in atom gas.

For far oﬀ-resonant lattices the possibility to control the cold collisions coherently
has been proposed [70] and realized in an experiment [33]. This allows the creation
of an entanglement between the atoms, a step towards quantum computing in optical
lattices [71]. Moreover, the observation of superﬂuid–Mott-insulator phase transition
helps in ﬁlling in the sites of the far-oﬀ resonant lattice by controlled particle number
[5]. For dissipative optical lattices, the creation of a double optical lattice opens
interesting prospect for cold collision studies in the presence of near-resonant light
[34].

Radiative heating and optical shielding studies in MOTs typically use the
molecular state description of the binary atomic system. After choosing the speciﬁc
excited molecular state and doing the partial wave expansion, usually only the lowest
relative angular momentum ground and excited state are accounted. The other option
has been to consider independent pairs of partial wave states, neglecting the coupling
between the pairs in a weak ﬁeld approximation [66]. Thus the descriptions in the past
have been two-state models, neglecting the multitude of internal states of the atoms,
and without the position dependent coupling between the atoms and the laser ﬁeld.
For optical lattices the internal states of the atoms have to be accounted because of
the spatial periodicity of the coupling caused by the polarization gradients of the laser
ﬁeld.

We use the two-atom product state basis [72]. For two six-level atoms in the red-
detuned case this means 36 basis states. If the basis is transformed into a molecular
one, there are manifolds of attractive and repulsive molecular states buried in our
description. We are forced to do the calculations in one dimension since the limited
amount of computational resources.

A resonant dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms in optical lattices has been
studied with nondynamic approaches [73, 74, 75, 76, 77]. Usually these studies assume
ﬁxed positions for the atoms and concentrate on the mean-ﬁeld type descriptions of the
lattice system. These approaches neglect the dynamical nature of the cold collisions,
and the inelastic processes of radiative heating or incomplete optical shielding. Our
approach includes the dynamical processes of Sisyphus cooling and cold collisions in
the same framework. It is important to note that once the atoms are localized into
the optical lattice sites, they are still able to move around in the lattice. For shallow
lattices this is because the quantum-mechanical tunneling probability between the
lattice sites is not negligible. For deep optical lattices, which are more relevant to
our case, the atomic motion between the wells may be induced by the recoil eﬀects
combined with the optical pumping process.

For the lattice parameters we use, we have noticed that inter-well eﬀects are
negligible and our interest lies in the case when two atoms end up in the same lattice
site and collide. The intra-well collision partners may then gain kinetic energy due
to an inelastic collision and escape from the lattice. In the case of optical shielding,
the possibility of making the collisions elastic and preventing the atoms from close
encounters would also prevent the atoms to escape from the lattice.

Numerical simulations are extremely heavy, especially in the case of red-detuned
lattices where the level scheme can not be simpliﬁed. For the required computer

PhD Tutorial

resources, see Appendix A. We are forced to make some simpliﬁcations to our model,
for details see [37]. Most importantly, we have to neglect the reabsorption of the
scattered photons. With increasing atomic density, reabsorption may heat the atomic
cloud and cause radiation pressure to outward direction from the trap center [10],
limiting the achievable atomic densities. In the blue-detuned lattice, the number of
scattered photons is largely reduced because the center of each lattice site corresponds
to a completely dark point in space. For red-detuned lattices we merely describe
the eﬀects of collisions on the thermodynamical properties of the cloud. The full
thermodynamics is not described since we neglect reabsorption. This poses some
limitations for the applicability of our results in red-detuned lattices, but for the blue-
detuned case our description is close to the complete thermodynamical description
because the scattering is generally low.

In the following Subsection we describe how we calculate the interaction
matrix elements between two multistate atoms, especially the resonant dipole-dipole
interaction matrix elements. The whole problem is then formulated by using the
MCWF method. For details, see Ref. [37]. The Section ends with the presentation of
the central results.

4.1. Resonant dipole-dipole interaction

One of the early treatments for resonant dipole-dipole forces between two atoms was
given already at the end of the 30’s [78], and the retardation eﬀects were discussed
almost a decade later [79]. Later on, Lenz and Meystre considered the resonant dipole-
dipole interaction (DDI) for two two-level atoms in a standing-wave ﬁeld [80]. Our
derivation follows their approach and makes the generalization to the multilevel atom
case.

The DDI is the ﬁrst interaction to come into play when the colliding atoms
approach each other in dissipative optical lattice. Since the interaction between the
atoms is mediated by the quantized environment, the natural starting point is the
two-atom system master equation and its damping part describing the coupling of the
system to the electromagnetic environment [80] [see also Eq. (18)]

It is worth noting that the interaction potential (28) includes the retardation eﬀects.
By diagonalizing Vdip, it is possible to obtain the molecular potentials shown in Fig. 11.
We use the molecular basis occasionally for the qualitative description of the collision
processes and emphasize that the calculations are done in the two-atom product state
basis.

4.2. Monte Carlo wave-function formulation

We use a variant of the Monte Carlo (MC) method which was developed by Dalibard,
Castin, and Mølmer [46, 47, 48]. The core idea of the Monte Carlo wave-function
(MCWF) method is the generation of a large number of single wave function
realizations including stochastic quantum jumps of the system studied. Quantum
jumps occur to the available decay channels of the system whose environment is
continuously monitored. In our case, detection of a photon corresponds to a quantum
jump from an internal excited electronic state to the ground electronic state of an
atom in an optical lattice. Solutions for the steady state density matrix and system
properties can be calculated as ensemble averages of single wave-function realizations.

where j1 and j2 denote the ground and excited states of atom 1 and 2 respectively, m1
and m2 the z-component of the angular momentum. Due to the limited availability
of computer resources we have to ﬁx the position of atom 1 by setting z1 = 0, and z2
is then the both position of the moving atom 2 in the lattice, as well as the relative
coordinate [37].

The non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H in Eq. (30) is

H = HS + HDEC ,

(32)
where the system Hamiltonian HS in our case includes the atom-laser interaction
Hamiltonians expanded in the two-atom Hilbert space, and the resonant dipole-dipole
interaction between the atoms, Eqs. (7,15,28).

lattice studies. There is a large number of numerical problems one has to solve for
the MC implementation of two atoms in a lattice, for a list and solutions see Ref. [37].

4.3. Red-detuned lattices

In this Subsection we present the main results from Refs. [36, 37] which deal with
collision dynamics in red-detuned lattices. The main collision process in this case is
radiative heating, see Section 3.1.

Optical lattices, which are detuned a few atomic linewidths below the atomic
resonance frequency, provide a very eﬃcient environment for Sisyphus cooling [23].
Once the atoms are localized into the lattice sites, they are still able to move around
in the lattice. When the occupation density of the lattice increases one can ask what
is the eﬀect of collisions for the Sisyphus cooling dynamics in optical lattices, and how
the cold collisions aﬀect the atomic cloud once the atoms are localized.

At the beginning of the eﬃcient cooling period a large fraction of atoms have
higher kinetic energy than the optical lattice modulation depth. Atoms then have
a high mobility and change their internal state frequently via the optical pumping
cycles which cool them. A priori one might assume that the possible consequence of
collisions would be a slowing of the cooling process, heating, and escape of the atoms
from the lattice. Radiative heating studies at low temperatures in MOTs show a
smooth widening of the momentum probability distribution corresponding to heating
for large range of parameters [65, 66], see Fig. 8. A similar eﬀect might be expected
to occur in an optical lattice as well.

It turns out that the internal structure of the atoms and the spatial dependence
of the atom-ﬁeld coupling changes the consequences of the collisions to some
extent. Lattice structure introduces selectivity into the collision processes and atomic
dynamics.
In a lattice, the mobility of an atom between the lattice sites depends
essentially on the kinetic energy, especially once the atoms are localized into the
lattice sites. An atom, which has a large oscillation amplitude (corresponding to a
large kinetic energy) in the lattice site, has a higher probability to change its internal
ground state by optical pumping than an atom which is tightly localized into the
vicinity of the center of the potential well. Rich dynamical features of the wave
packet, like breathing and oscillations in a single lattice site, arise due to the fact that

Figure 12. An example of a single wave packet realization from the full MC
ensemble in position space (note the direction of z-axis because of the viewing
angle). At the beginning of the time evolution the atom oscillates in the lattice
well which has the center at z = 0.25λ.
It then approaches point z = 0 (the
position of the ﬁxed atom), collides with another atom, and gains enough kinetic
energy to be ejected from the lattice.

collision, and the atom consequently escapes from the lattice.

the packet here describes a superposition of the populations in the vibrational states
of a lattice potential [83].

Since the high kinetic energy atoms are more mobile compared to their low kinetic
energy partners, the high kinetic energy atoms have also a higher collision probability.
During the same period of time the high-energy atoms change their internal ground
state and the corresponding optical potential more often than tightly localized atoms.
Thus, the coverage of various lattice sites, and the corresponding collision probability,
is higher for more mobile atoms.

With these assumptions the consequence of collisions might be simple heating of
the atomic cloud, or escape of the atoms from the lattice. The essential ingredient

and non–interacting atoms in a red-detuned optical lattice [37]. The momentum

sodium lattice with lattice depth U0 = 339Er.

for a large kinetic energy increase is a high excitation probability of a quasimolecule.
This depends on the curvature of the molecular potentials at a resonant Condon
point and especially on the relative velocity between the colliding atoms. The optical
lattice modulation depth deﬁnes the initial velocity distribution of the atoms when
they start to move between the lattice sites after localization. It turns out that in a
typical lattice, detuned a few atomic linewidths below the atomic resonance, and for
lattice depths of a few hundred recoil energies, the surroundings are very favorable
for strong excitation of the quasimolecule and the corresponding large kinetic energy
changing collisions. The consequence is that the atoms mainly leave the lattice when
colliding, and the total eﬀect is the ejection of the hot atoms from the lattice. The
ones which remain in a lattice have lower average kinetic energy per atom than in the
low occupation density case of the lattice when there is no need to account for the
interactions between the atoms. Figures 12 and 13 show in position and momentum
spaces, respectively, an example of a collision which ejects the atoms from the lattice.
The selective escape mechanism resembles evaporative cooling used to produce
BEC in magnetic traps. Here the rethermalization of the remaining atoms is more
limited, though. Anyhow, spatial dependence of the laser ﬁeld introduces selective
heating of the hot atoms, and the consequent escape from the lattice.
It would
probably be too far reaching to claim that this eﬀect should be visible in an
experiment. Our model neglects the reabsorption of photons which may aﬀect the
total thermodynamics of the atomic cloud at high densities, and we neglect also
the Doppler cooling. Thus we have revealed one aspect of the thermodynamics of
a densely-populated near-resonant optical lattice but the solution for the complete
problem is simply out of reach for the modern computational resources.

Figure 14 shows an example of the results for collisions in a red-detuned lattice
from Ref. [37]. This example is for a sodium lattice of depth U0 = 339Er. The
comparison is done between the momentum probability distributions of the interacting
and non-interacting cases with occupation density of 25% of the lattice. The central

peak is clearly narrower when the interactions between the atoms have been included.
This central peak corresponds to the atoms which are trapped in a lattice, and the
wide wings correspond to background atoms which are presumably out of the recapture
range of the lattice and ejected from the lattice.

One can calculate by semi-classical means the excitation and survival probability
for various molecular potentials. We have done a simple semi-classical analysis by using
Landau-Zener approach in Ref. [37]. This analysis supports the conclusions presented
above and shows the high probability for the atom pair to gain kinetic energy by the
amount with which the collision partners are kicked out from the lattice.

4.4. Blue-detuned lattices

The prospect of using the trapping and cooling lasers for eﬃcient optical shielding has
been studied in Ref. [39]. Complete optical shielding would make collisions between
atoms, when they end up in a same lattice site, elastic, and it would also prevent
atoms from close encounters, reducing, e.g., inelastic hyperﬁne changing collisions.
Thus eﬃcient optical shielding could be beneﬁcial in optical lattices in addition to
the typical darkness of the blue-detuned lattices. The number of scattered photons in
gray-lattices can be roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than in MOTs [42]. The
role of the radiation pressure due to the reabsorption of photons diminishes, and our
simpliﬁed model describes in a more realistic way the total thermodynamics of the
atomic cloud, not only the collision aspect of the thermodynamics.

Figure 15 presents the results of the simulations where the detuning is ﬁxed to
δ = 5Γ [39]. The results show clearly how the eﬃciency of the shielding changes.
When the coupling laser is weak, a large number of the collisions are still inelastic
ones. Wide wings appear in the momentum probability distribution, see Figs. 15 (a)
and 15 (b). All the population, which is excited at the Condon point, does not return

to the ground state when the atoms move apart again. The quasimolecule slides down
on the tail of the repulsive state producing a mild heating eﬀect [67]. For a moderate
ﬁeld strength it is hard to see diﬀerences between the distributions for the interacting
and non-interacting atoms, Fig. 15 (c). The optical shielding has become complete
and atoms collide elastically when they end up in the same lattice site. The collision
partners begin to move apart at large internuclear distances and also the short range
unwanted eﬀects are avoided. A further increase in the laser ﬁeld strength makes it
possible for the population to be excited into the attractive molecular state by oﬀ-
resonant means [68]. This is the reason for the deviation of the two distributions in
Fig. 15 (d), where the appearance of the wings is also qualitatively diﬀerent than in
the weak-ﬁeld case of incomplete shielding.

Figure 16 presents another view to the shielding studies [39]. Instead of keeping
the laser detuning ﬁxed, here the lattice modulation depth is kept nearly constant. It
turns out that for a very small detuning, Fig. 16 (a), the oﬀ-resonant eﬀects heat the
atomic cloud. This corresponds to the regime where Ω/δ > 1, and the steady state
formation between the ground and the excited states surpasses the dynamical resonant
excitation process. When the detuning is increased, the point of complete shielding
is reached, Fig. 16 (b). In the region where Ω/δ
1, Fig. 16 (c) and (d), shielding
becomes incomplete again due to the weak excitation and stimulated re-excitation in
Condon point.

≪

The results demonstrate clearly that the co-existence of cooling, trapping, and
shielding processes is possible in blue-detuned near-resonant optical lattices. The
shielding is not always complete but by the careful choice of parameters shielding
becomes very eﬃcient. Moreover, this can be obtained within a very typical and
convenient parameter regime for near-resonant lattices, e.g., in Fig. 15 (c) δ = 5Γ,
Ω = 3Γ, and U0 = 712Er. A clear advantage here is the achievement of complete
shielding with the same lasers which provide the cooling and trapping. This is in
contrast to MOTs where one needs to introduce additional lasers for shielding.

PhD Tutorial

Even though the available occupation densities in near-resonant optical lattices
have been very low so far, the metastable rare-gas atoms could provide a convenient
case for an experimental study of shielding in optical lattices due to the clear ion signal
that marks collision events [84, 85].

The experimental work on optical shielding in MOTs show the saturation of
the shielding phenomena when the intensity of the laser ﬁeld is increased [9]. The
saturation has not been present in earlier theoretical studies of shielding [67, 68],
and we do not see the saturation of shielding here either. The results presented in
Ref. [39] seem to conﬁrm the view that the saturation does not arise due to spontaneous
emission eﬀects [67]. The reason for the saturation of shielding is still unclear. It has
been attributed to various processes, in addition to the above-mentioned premature
termination of shielding via spontaneous emission [67]. Other possibilities include
counterintuitive or oﬀ-resonant processes involving diﬀerent partial waves, or other
processes that similarly involve multiple states (in contrast to the basic two-state
approaches [9, 69, 86, 87]). Anyhow, since our model is limited, we can not conclusively
say that saturation of shielding should be absent in a lattice experiment.

So far there has been very few cold collision experiments in optical lattices [88, 89].
These experiments showed how the lattice structure aﬀects the transport of atoms
by using collisions as a probe. We hope that our work serves as a motivation for
experimentalists to do shielding studies in blue-detuned optical lattices.

4.5. Collision rates

The results of Refs. [36, 37] show that in our selected parameter regime, i.e., the
typical parameter regime for near-resonant lattices, the motion of the atom between
the lattice sites (or in the lattice site occupied by the single atom only) is not strongly
aﬀected by other atoms, not at least for the occupation densities which we have used
(maximum 25%). Hence, binary interactions between the atoms come into play only
when two atoms simultaneously occupy the same lattice site. This makes it possible to
develop a method to calculate the average rate at which two atoms end up in the same
site, and the consequent cold collision rate in a lattice, by following the trajectories of
single atoms [38]. Cold collision rate refers here to the average rate of atoms to reach
the region of the resonant Condon point in the presence of near-resonant light and
describes the rate of occurrence of radiative heating events in a red-detuned lattice,
or optical shielding events, if blue-detuned light is used. It is assumed that the two
atoms always collide when they end up in the same lattice site. For the parameters
used here, this assumption is conﬁrmed by the results in Refs. [36, 37].

The basic idea of the developed method is as follows. A possible trajectory of an
atom in optical lattice is given by single MCWF realization. Trajectories in position
space can then give information about the rate at which atoms travel over the average
distance za between the atoms, which in turn gives information about the binary
collision rate in a lattice. The average distance between atoms za corresponds to the
mean free path of atoms between collision events in our one-dimensional model. Thus,
if we monitor the transport of atoms in the lattice over the average distance between
the atoms, or the atomic ﬂux over the average distance, we also obtain information
about the collision rates.

Figure 17 displays the calculated collision rates as a function of the occupation
density of the lattice for three diﬀerent lattice depths [38].
In our simple 1D case
the collision rate does not depend on the scattering cross section and collisions are a

measure of transport in a lattice. This was also the case in the experimental study of
Ref. [89]. In both cases the collision rate has a quadratic behavior.

The points in Fig. 17 are the simulation results and the solid lines quadratic
ﬁts. It is interesting to note from the Monte Carlo point of view that we get results
for a wide density range by doing simulations for only a very few values of density.
The possibility of obtaining the result for all the values of the variable, in this case
occupation density, from single Monte Carlo ensemble is a new feature in MCWF
simulations to our knowledge, at least when MCWF method is applied to cold collision
problems.

Two-atom collision simulations in a lattice described in previous Subsections are
computationally very heavy.
It would be useful to ﬁnd more simple means to do
collision studies in optical lattices. The method presented above presents a step in
this direction. For example, if the semiclassical analysis shows that for particular
parameter values the colliding atoms have a high probability to be ejected from the
lattice due to radiative heating, then the collision rate described here gives directly
the loss rate of atoms from the lattice. MCWF simulations for one atom, like the
ones reported in Ref. [38], are fairly simple and fast to perform. This is especially true
when compared to the two-atom case. Thus the combination of these simple one-atom
simulations with semiclassical models for intra-well collision eﬀects have a potential
to simplify the studies of binary collisions in optical lattices.

5. Conclusions

We have studied the cold collision dynamics between atoms in near-resonant,
dissipative red- and blue-detuned optical lattices. The applied methods have been
mainly based on the Monte Carlo wave-function method. A semiclassical analysis has
been done which supports the conclusions drawn from the full quantum-mechanical
calculations.

The implementation of the MCWF method to study cold collisions in optical

lattices is not straightforward and the simulations have been very demanding from
the computer resource point of view. This is due to the internal structure of atoms,
coupling to the electromagnetic environment, position dependent coupling of the atoms
to the laser ﬁeld, and position dependent coupling between the atoms.

The results for near-resonant red-detuned lattices are in quite a sharp contrast
to the interaction studies in magneto-optical traps. Instead of heating, a cooling due
to the selection of collision partners from high kinetic energy atoms is seen in the
simulation results. The blue-lattice results show the applicability of optical shielding.
Future collision studies require simpliﬁcations, for which we propose a simple way to
calculate the collision rate in optical lattices.

In the past there has been many studies of cold collisions in magneto-optical
traps, see the review [9]. The work presented in here extends the regime of cold
collision studies into the realm of optical lattices. This is far from being a trivial
step. The major reason is that for sub-Doppler cooling mechanisms, which exploit
various polarization states of a laser ﬁeld, it is necessary to account for the internal
structure of atoms, and this greatly complicates the total system under study and
the calculations. Moreover, it is not enough to formulate the problem using only the
relative motion between the atoms in a constant laser ﬁeld. The position of the atoms
with respect to a lattice structure has to be accounted also.

In conclusion, we have shown how research on cold collisions in the present of
near-resonant light can be extended from magneto-optical traps to cover also optical
lattices. In future, the recently developed double optical lattice [34] opens interesting
prospects for the experimental study on cold collisions in dissipative optical lattices.

Appendix A. Required computational resources

The numerical simulations are demanding since we are dealing with a 36 level quantum
system including various position dependent couplings and a dissipative coupling to
the environment. We have used 32 processors of an SGI Origin 2000 machine, which
has 128 MIPS R12000 processors of 1 GB memory per processor [90]. The total
memory taken by a single simulation (ﬁxed δ, Ω, occupation density ρo, and atomic
species) is 14 GB, and generating a single history requires 6 hours of CPU time in
red-detuned lattice studies. A simulation of 128 ensemble members then requires a
total CPU time which is roughly equal to one month. The normal clock time is, of
course, much shorter (roughly 22 hours) since we take advantage of powerful parallel
processing for which the MCWF simulations suit very well.

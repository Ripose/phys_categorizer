(Dated: October 31, 2005)

The pure electric ﬁeld level-crossing of mF Zeeman sublevels of hyperﬁne F levels at two-step
laser excitation was described theoretically and studied experimentally for the nD3/2 states in Cs
with n = 7, 9 and 10, by applying a diode laser in the ﬁrst 6S1/2 → 6P3/2 step and a diode or
dye laser for the second 6P3/2 → nD3/2 step. Level-crossing resonance signals were observed in
the nD3/2 → 6P1/2 ﬂuorescence. A theoretical model was developed to describe quantitatively the
resonance signals by correlation analysis of the optical Bloch equations in the case when an atom
simultaneously interacts with two laser ﬁelds in the presence of an external dc electric ﬁeld. The
simulations described well the experimental signals. The tensor polarizabilities α2 (in a3
0) were
determined to be 7.45(20) × 104 for the 7D3/2 state and 1.183(35) × 106 for the 9D3/2 state; a well
established α2 value for 10D3/2 was used to calibrate the electric ﬁeld. The α2 value for the 7D3/2
state diﬀered by ca. 15% from the existing experimentally measured value.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst experimental demonstration of crossings of
certain magnetic (mF ) components of hyperﬁne struc-
ture (hfs) levels F at non-zero electric ﬁeld E was re-
ported in 1966 in a paper by Khadjavi, Happer and Lu-
rio [1]. In this work, the authors observed the Stark ef-
fect in the second excited state of the alkali metal atoms
85,87Rb (6P3/2) and 133Cs (7P3/2). Using resonant ex-
citation from a gas-discharge lamp, they observed reso-
nances at the level-crossing positions in the ﬂuorescence
signals from single-step broad-line light excitation. Such
a method of Stark level-crossing spectroscopy was ap-
plied by the same authors to determine experimentally
the tensor polarizabilities α2 in these states, as well as
to determine α2 in 39K(5P3/2) [2, 3]. Later on, however,
it became more popular to vary the magnetic ﬁeld in the
presence of a constant electric ﬁeld. This way of inducing
level-crossings was preferred, perhaps because magnetic
ﬁelds were easier to produce and control. Such techniques
were used to measure the tensor polarizabilities α2 of al-
kali atoms by Svanberg and co-authors (see [4, 5, 6, 7]
and references therein). In particular, this method was
used in a two-step excitation with a radio-frequency dis-
charge lamp and a narrow-width dye laser [5, 6, 7]. The
development of narrow line-width lasers enabled Stark
shifts to be measured directly [8] by scanning the electric
ﬁeld at a ﬁxed laser frequency. Both methods made it
possible to determine a large number of excited S and
D state scalar and tensor polarizabilities of Rb and Cs,
achieving an accuracy of some 5% (see [9] for a review).
The use of electro-optically modulated laser radiation al-
lowed Xia and co-authors [10] to measure the scalar and
tensor polarizabilities of (10 − 13)D3/2,5/2 states of Cs
with an accuracy better than 0.3%, which is better than
for any other atomic state.

Thus, to our knowledge there has been no experimen-
tal observation of purely electric ﬁeld level-crossing res-
onances of mF hfs levels at two-step, or any multi-step,
laser excitation. At the same time, no detailed theo-
retical descriptions of the expected signals at two-step
excitation had been reported in the literature until now.

The purpose of the present investigation was (i) to ob-
serve the Stark eﬀect induced level-crossing resonances
at two-step laser excitation; (ii) to develop a proper the-
oretical description based on the optical Bloch equations
for radiation ﬁelds with ﬁnite spectral widths [11]; and
(iii) to study experimentally the tensor polarizabilities α2
for the nD3/2 states of Cs atoms which were accessible
with laser sources at our disposal, namely the states with
n = 7, 9, and 10. The 7D3/2 state was of particular in-
terest because of a considerable discrepancy between the
only known measured value for the polarizability α2 [12]
and its theoretical estimate given in [13]. At the same
time, the α2 value for the 10D3/2 Cs state was measured
with unprecedented accuracy of 0.1% [10] and remark-
ably agreed, within 0.25%, with its calculated counter-
part in [13]. As a result, we used the signal from the
10D3/2 state to calibrate the electric ﬁeld produced in
our Cs cell. A measurement of both states in the same
experimental arrangement allowed us to measure the po-
larizability in the 7D3/2 state as well as in the 9D3/2
state with greater conﬁdence. Furthermore, Stark eﬀect
studies in highly excited Cs states were particularly in-
teresting, as Cs might be useful as a tracer gas to image
electric ﬁelds [14] at room temperature, or even lower
temperatures.

II. EXPERIMENT

A. Method

In our experiment, we detected the resonance signals
caused by hfs level-crossings in an external dc electric
ﬁeld when several mF Zeeman sublevels of hfs levels
were coherently excited. Figure 1 illustrates the cross-
ing points of the hyperﬁne sublevels in the (7,9,10)D3/2
states.
The stepwise two-laser excitation 6S1/2 →
6P3/2 → nD3/2 of the 7D3/2, 9D3/2 and 10D3/2 levels
of atomic cesium was followed by the nD3/2 → 6P1/2 ﬂu-
orescence, as shown in Fig. 2. The ﬂuorescence intensity
signal as a function of the electric ﬁeld strength is ex-
pected to contain resonances at positions corresponding
to the mF level-crossings. To predict the resonance posi-
tions, we computed the energy level splitting diagram in
the presence of an electric ﬁeld for hfs levels in the nD3/2
states of Cs under study (see Fig. 1) using α2 values
calculated by Wijngaarden and Li [13]. We performed
this calculation, whose results are shown in Fig. 1 by
diagonalizing the hfs and Stark interaction Hamiltonian
written in an uncoupled basis [15]. The values for the
hfs constant A were taken from the review of Arimondo
and collaborators [16], in which the following values were
given: A = 7.4(2) MHz for 7D3/2 as measured in [7], A =
2.35(4) MHz for 9D3/2, and A = 1.51(2) MHz for 10D3/2
as measured in [17, 18]. To our knowledge, no other ex-
perimental data of hfs constants for these states of Cs
were present in literature. Values for the hfs constant B
were not reported and were assumed to be small.

As seen in Fig. 1, two crossings were predicted in the
experimentally available electric ﬁeld range: one cross-
ing within the F = 4 manifold with ∆mF = ±1 and ±2
and a second ∆mF = ±2 crossing between the mF = ±5
sublevels of the F = 5 level and the mF = ±3 sublevel of
the F = 4 level. When the atoms were excited with lin-
early polarized light, and linearly polarized ﬂuorescence
light was observed, resonances were expected at the elec-
tric ﬁeld values corresponding the the level-crossings with
∆mF = ±2 [19, 20].

B. Experimental details

The schematic diagram of the experiment is depicted
in Fig. 3. In our experiment, cesium vapor was produced
in a sealed glass cell kept at room temperature. An elec-
tric ﬁeld up to E = 2400 V/cm was applied via transpar-
ent Stark electrodes located inside the cell. Therefore,
ﬂuorescence light could be observed in the direction of
the electric ﬁeld. The electrodes were separated by two
ceramic spacer-rods, which had a diameter of 2.5 mm.
The transparent electrodes were produced by depositing
Indium-Tin-Oxide vapor on two glass plates. High volt-
age could be applied to these electrodes using two metal
rods which protruded through the glass cell wall. High-
temperature conducting silver paste was used to provide

tric ﬁeld for the 7D3/2 (a), 9D3/2 (b), and 10D3/2 (c) states of

energy.

a contact between the electrodes and the metal rods.

The 7D3/2, 9D3/2, and 10D3/2 states of cesium were
studied using two-step laser excitation (see Fig. 2). For
the ﬁrst step, 852.1 nm radiation of the diode laser (LD-
0850-100sm laser diode) was used to excite the 6P3/2
state. The ﬁrst laser was linearly polarized with polar-

ization vector E1 along the external dc electric ﬁeld E
direction (E k z). Radiation from the second laser, po-
larized as E2 k x, was sent in a counter-propagating di-
rection to induce either the 6P3/2 →7D3/2 transition at
698.4 nm using a Hitachi HL6738MG laser diode or the
6P3/2 → 9D3/2 transition at 584.8 nm and the 6P3/2 →
10D3/2 transition at 563.7 nm using a Coherent CR699-
21 ring dye laser with Rodamin 6G dye. The dye laser
was pumped by a Spectra-Physics 171 argon ion laser op-
erating at the 514.5 nm line. The laser induced ﬂuores-
cence (LIF) nD3/2 → 6P1/2 was observed at 672.3 nm,
566.4 nm, and 546.6 nm, for n = 7, 9, and 10, respec-
tively. Before being observed, the LIF passed through
a linear polarizer. The observation direction was along
the z-axis. Hence, we could observe the LIF intensity
components Ix and Iy (see Fig. 3), which were polarized
parallel and perpendicular to E2, respectively.

In order to excite the cesium atoms from the ground
state hyperﬁne level with total angular momentum quan-
tum number F = 4 to all allowed 6P3/2 state hyperﬁne
levels F = 3, 4, 5, the ﬁrst laser was operated in a multi-
mode regime. When the second laser was the diode laser,
we applied a 10-20 Hz saw-tooth signal to the piezo-
electric crystal mounted to its grating in order to jitter
its output frequency over a range of 1.2 GHz. The dye
laser was operated in a single-mode regime. To avoid op-
tical pumping, neutral density ﬁlters were used to reduce
the dye laser intensity. The power of the diode and dye
lasers were not more than 3 and 10 mW, respectively.
The laser beams had a diameter of approximately 1 mm.
The frequency of both lasers was adjusted to maximize
the observed ﬂuorescence intensities at the beginning of
each measurement.

The LIF was focused by means of a two-lens system
onto the entrance slit of a model MDR-3 monochroma-
tor with 1.3 nm/mm inverse dispersion and detected with
a model FEU-79 photomultiplier tube, which was oper-
ated in photon counting mode. The intensities Ix and
Iy of the LIF were detected as a function of E. During
the experiment, the high voltage between the electrodes
was scanned continuously. The photon counts were ac-

produced an electric ﬁeld along the z-axis, which was also
parallel to the polarization vector of the ﬁrst laser E1 and the

cumulated during one second intervals and recorded on
a PC together with the electrode voltage using a voltage
divider. Signals were accumulated during more than 10
scans of approximately 100 s duration, binned and aver-
aged. We could adjust for the delay between the voltage
that was recorded and the actual voltage during the inte-
gration interval by comparing the results recorded with
rising and falling voltages.

C. Results

The measured relative ﬂuorescence intensity was plot-
ted as a function of electric ﬁeld strength in Figs. 4–6.
The measured signals were represented by dots, whereas
solid lines were plotted to represent the results of sim-
ulations. The model on which these simulations were
based was described in Section 3 of this paper. The error
bars reﬂected the statistical variation in each bin after
the scans were averaged. We labeled the experimental
geometry as zyx or zyy: the ﬁrst letter z denoted the
orientation of the polarization of the ﬁrst laser E1 (see
Fig. 3), the second letter y denoted the orientation of
E2, and the third letter x or y denoted the direction of
LIF polarization that we observed.

The measurements for the 10D3/2 state were plotted in
Fig. 4. Since the tensor polarizability α2 for the 10D3/2
state was known far better than for the other states [10],
we used the data in Fig. 4 to calibrate the voltage. In
Fig. 4, the voltage scale was left uncalibrated to illustrate

the precision with which the electrode spacing was known
before calibration. To simulate the results, we used the
hyperﬁne constant A and experimentally determined ten-
sor polarizability α2 shown in Table I. By comparing the
position of the second peak (corresponding to the F =4
to F =5 crossing) in our measured curve with the peak
position of the calculated curve, we determined that the
voltage scale had to be corrected by 2%.

The results for the 9D3/2 and 7D3/2 states were plotted
in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. The voltage scales in Figs.
5 and 6 have been adjusted using the scaling factor ob-
tained from the calibration with the 10D3/2 signal in Fig.
4. The solid lines in Figs. 5 and 6 represented the result
of calculations, which were performed using the hyper-
ﬁne constant A from Table I and a tensor polarizability
α2 adjusted so that the peak positions in the simulations
and measured data matched. To illustrate the sensitivity
of our method, we included in Fig. 6 as a dashed line the
results of a calculation using the previously measured α2
values shown in Table I.

III. THEORETICAL MODEL

A. Outline of the model

In the experiment described above, atoms strongly in-
teracted with radiation simultaneously produced by two
lasers. Nonlinear interactions can cause shifts of the mag-
netic levels in the laser ﬁeld [21], and as a result, shifts of
the level-crossing positions. The theoretical description
of our experiment was further complicated by the fact,
that in order to excite coherently magnetic sublevels that
were split in an external ﬁeld, we used the lasers that
generated a rather broad proﬁle of radiation. In this sit-
uation, a model that was able to describe signals quan-
titatively was essential in order to analyze the obtained
signals and to be able to deduce atomic constants from

zyx geometry (a) and zyy (b). Dots, measurements; solid
line, calculation. The voltage scale was calibrated using data
from Fig. 4.

these signals.

In the present study, such a model was elaborated on
the basis of an approach that we developed for the rate
equations for Zeeman coherences in the case where atoms
were excited by one partially coherent optical ﬁeld [11].
In this paper, we extended this approach to the case
when an atom interacts with two laser ﬁelds simultane-
ously in presence of an external dc electric ﬁeld E. We
assumed that the atomic center of mass moved classically,
which meant that the description of the dipole interac-
tion of the atom with the laser ﬁelds could assume a
classically moving atom that was excited at the internal
transitions.
In this case the internal atomic dynamics
could be described by the semiclassical atomic density
matrix ρ, which parametrically depended on the classical
coordinates of the atomic center of mass.

We considered the absorption of the ﬁrst laser’s radi-
ation as the atoms were excited from the atomic ground
state denoted by g to the intermediate state denoted by e.
Then a second laser excited the atoms further from the e
state to the ﬁnal state f . The direct transition g ↔ f was
forbidden in the dipole approximation. In our particular
case (see Fig. 2), the ground state of the Cs atom con-
sisted of two hfs levels Fg = 3 and Fg = 4. Each of these

5

With the above assumptions, we were able to develop
a model, described below, to calculate the observed level-
crossing signals in our experiment.

B. Optical Bloch equations

We started our analysis from the optical Bloch equa-
tions (OBEs) for the density matrix elements ρgigj , ρgiej ,
ρgifj , ρeigj , ρeiej , ρeifj , ρfigj , ρfiej , and ρfifj . In writing

also assumed that diﬀerent velocity groups of the ther-

In this case the relaxation

where γ and λ were the transit relaxation rates. The
quantity λδgi,gj described the process in which “fresh”

hfs levels in turn consisted of 2Fg + 1 magnetic sublevels,
denoted by gi in what follows. The intermediate state in
our experiment was the 6P3/2 state of the Cs atom. It
consisted of four hyperﬁne levels with Fe = 2, 3, 4 and 5
and the corresponding number of magnetic sublevels, de-
noted as ei. Finally, the atomic level that was excited by
the second laser was the nD3/2 state, which again con-
sisted of hyperﬁne levels with Ff = 2, 3, 4 and 5. We
denoted the magnetic sublevels of these states as fi.

To simulate the observed signals, we had to take into
account that the external electric ﬁeld was strong enough
to break partially the hyperﬁne interaction between elec-
tronic angular momentum of the atom and the nuclear
spin. As a result (see Fig. 1) the magnetic sublevel en-
ergies in the external dc electric ﬁeld did not depend
quadratically on the electric ﬁeld strength any more.
This dependence could be obtained only by diagonalizing
the full Hamilton matrix. The partial decoupling of the
electronic angular momentum and nuclear spin altered
also the dipole transition probabilities between the mag-
netic sublevels of the atoms belonging to the diﬀerent ﬁne
structure levels. This decoupling was taken into account
in the simulation of the experimental signals.

where ωij = ωi − ωj denoted the splitting of the levels
i and j and dik ≡ hi |d| ki. By choosing the quantization
axis (the z-axis) to be parallel to the static electric ﬁeld
E, all the explicit dependence of the density matrix on
the static electric ﬁeld E was included in the splitting
terms ωij.
Implicitly, the density matrix depended on
the dc electric ﬁeld, because this ﬁeld modiﬁed the dipole
transition matrix elements by partially decoupling the
hyperﬁne interaction.

In order to simplify the above equation, we did the fol-
lowing: we neglected possible optical excitations of neigh-
boring transitions, that is, we neglected the excitation of
the transitions g ↔ e (e ↔ f ) with the second (ﬁrst)
laser, which was tuned to the transition e ↔ f (g ↔ e).
Then, in order to eliminate fast oscillations with optical
frequencies ωi, we applied to the optical Bloch equations
the rotating wave approximation for multilevel systems
as developed in [24]:

In the experiment we observed signals that were av-

son with the characteristic phase-ﬂuctuation time of the
excitation-light source. Therefore we needed to perform
a statistical averaging of the above equations. In order
to do that, we solved the equations for optical coherences
and then took a formal statistical average over the ﬂuc-
tuating phases (for details see [11]). Additionally we as-
sumed that both lasers were uncorrelated and that opti-
ρeg) were independent of the

ﬂuctuations of the ﬁrst (second) laser, which was tuned
e
to the transition g ↔ e (e ↔ f ). Then we applied the

This system of equations was the one that we solved in
order to simulate the observed signals. When the density
matrix for the ﬁnal state was calculated, we obtained the
ﬂuorescence intensities with a speciﬁc polarization along
the unit vector e as [23, 26, 27]:

IV. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

The theoretical model discussed above was used to sim-
ulate our experiment, and the results of the simulations
were plotted together with the results of our measure-
ments in Fig. 4–6 as described in Section 2. Since the
precise shape of the level-crossing signal depended on var-
ious parameters that were beyond our ability to control
precisely, these parameters were adjusted in the calcu-
lation. The parameters that we adjusted were the Rabi
frequencies of the transitions, the laser radiation spec-
tral widths, and the detuning of the laser radiation rela-
tive to the exact transition frequencies. In addition, the
background was left as an adjustable parameter. The
generally good agreement between the calculation and
the measurement, except at electric ﬁelds far below and
above the level-crossing points, validated the theoretical
approach described in Section 3.

The positions of the resonances depended on the points
where energy levels crossed (see Fig. 1). These, in turn,
depended on the values of the hyperﬁne constants A and

B, and on the tensor polarizability α2. We took the hy-
perﬁne constants to be suﬃciently well determined (see
the review by Arimondo and collaborators [16]) to al-
low us to use our results to make a new measurement of
the tensor polarizabilities of the 9D3/2 and 7D3/2 states
of cesium. Our results were summarized in Table I and
compared with the previous measurements of Fredrikson
and Svanberg [9] and of Wessel and Cooper [12], and
with the theoretical calculations of α2 of Wijngaarden
and Li [13]. We estimated the accuracy of our value for
α2 based on the reproducibility of several measurements
and accounted for the uncertainty of the hyperﬁne con-
stant A and of the tensor polarizability α2 of the 10D3/2
state, on which our electric ﬁeld calibration was based.
Furthermore, we included the error in the measurements
of the polarizabilities of the 7D3/2 and 9D3/2 states in-
troduced by the reported uncertainties in their respective
hyperﬁne constants, A. The largest contributions to our
error were the uncertainty in the hyperﬁne constants and
in the electric ﬁeld calibration, whose contributions were
of comparable magnitude.

Our accuracy was competitive or slightly higher than
those of previously reported measurements of the tensor
polarizabilities for these atomic states. Our results were
consistent with the theoretical predictions for α2 of [13]
for the 9D3/2 state as well as with the previous mea-
surement of [9]. For the 7D3/2 state, our measurements
indicated a value for α2 that was higher than both the
previous measurement of Wessel and Cooper [12] and the
theoretical prediction of [13].

perﬁne F levels at two-step laser excitation has been ap-
plied to determine experimentally the tensor polarizabil-
ities of highly excited atomic states. Conventional laser
sources, including diode lasers, with rather broad line
contours were suﬃcient. In the case of crossings between
diﬀerent F sublevels with ∆mF = ±2, the resonance
peaks were suﬃciently sharp to enable accurate deter-
mination of the peak position. At the same time, the
ﬂuorescence intensity behavior within a broader electric
ﬁeld range, including additional crossings, together with
reliable signal simulations, enhanced the accuracy of the
technique.

For this purpose an adequate theoretical description
was worked out by extending an approach previously de-
veloped for two-level systems [11] to the case of a three-
level system. A signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation of the optical
Bloch equations was achieved by statistically averaging
over the ﬂuctuating phases and applying the “decorrela-
tion approximation. Though the problem was more cum-
bersome with more parameters to be considered, it made
it possible to describe satisfactorily the observed signals.
What is more, moderate computation times could be
achieved by replacing the Doppler distribution with a
group of atoms moving at a deﬁnite velocity.

The measured tensor polarizability for the higher-n
9D3/2 state (see Table I) agreed within experimental er-
ror with previously measured and calculated values. At
the same time the present measured tensor polarizability
for the lower-n 7D3/2 state diﬀered from the previously
measured experimental value [12] by ca. 15% while the

theoretical prediction of [13] was lower than our measured
value by some 5%.

To increase the accuracy and reliability of experimen-
tally measured tensor polarizabilities, it was useful to use
the calibration with respect to a level with well estab-
lished polarizability value. This approach substantially
diminished possible errors in the determination of exter-
nal electric ﬁeld values.

For the 7D3/2 and 9D3/2 states under study, the ac-
curacy of existing hfs constants limited the accuracy of
the tensor polarizability measurement which could be
achieved by applying electric ﬁeld induced level-crossing
spectroscopy.

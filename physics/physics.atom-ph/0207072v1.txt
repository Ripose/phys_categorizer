In a previous work [Phys. Rev. A 66, 0134XX (2002)] we noted a partial disagreement between
quantum R-matrix and semiclassical calculations of photoabsorption spectra of molecules in a mag-
netic ﬁeld. We show this disagreement is due to a non-vanishing contribution of processes which are
forbidden according to the usual semiclassical formalism. Formulas to include these processes are
obtained by using a reﬁned stationary phase approximation. The resulting higher order in ~ con-
tributions also account for previously unexplained “recurrences without closed-orbits”. Quantum
and semiclassical photoabsorption spectra for Rydberg atoms and molecules in a magnetic ﬁeld are
calculated and compared to assess the validity of the ﬁrst-order forbidden orbit contributions.

INTRODUCTION

The photo-absorption spectrum of excited atoms or molecules placed in a magnetic ﬁeld displays complex structures.
Closed-orbit theory consists of a fully quantitative approach in which the large-scale structures of the spectra are
explained in terms of classical trajectories closed at the nucleus, i.e., leaving and returning to the core. Each orbit
produces on its return an oscillation in the photo-absorption cross-section; the Fourier-transform of the spectrum,
known as the recurrence spectrum therefore exhibits sharp peaks at the period of the orbits. First developed for
the hydrogen atom [1], closed-orbit theory was then extended to treat the case of non-hydrogenic Rydberg atoms:
the additional spectral modulations appear as the result of successive quantum encounters of the Rydberg electron
with the core [2]. The wave-function follows the hydrogenic classical orbits in the region where the Coulomb and the
external ﬁelds compete (“outer region”), but near the core, where the external ﬁelds are negligible (“inner region”),
the wave-function is described quantum-mechanically.

More recently, we proposed a closed-orbit theory treatment of molecules in external ﬁelds [3, 4]:

in addition to
elastic scattering, inelastic scattering gives rise to novel spectral modulations. The relative importance of elastic and
inelastic scattering was shown to depend on the short-range phase-shifts, the molecular quantum defects.
In the
inelastic collision process, the molecular core undergoes a transition from its ground state to an excited state, and
the dynamical regime of the Rydberg electron changes accordingly, say from a chaotic to a near integrable classical
regime. Good quantitative agreements between quantum calculations and closed-orbit theory in the case of an external
magnetic ﬁeld were obtained. However we noted in Ref. [4] a discrepancy between the quantum and the semiclassical
results for certain peaks of the recurrence spectrum. In general, disagreements between semiclassical and quantum
recurrence spectra are due to higher order (in ~) eﬀects such as bifurcations or ghost orbits, and speciﬁc formulas to
account for these eﬀects have been developed [5, 6]. The discrepancies we observed in [4] are due to another type of
eﬀect, namely the manifestation of orbits which are forbidden to ﬁrst order in ~; these orbits are forbidden either i)
because they should not be excited according to the usual semiclassical formalism or ii) because they do not classically
exist.

We investigate in this work the eﬀects of such ﬁrst-order suppressed orbits. We will derive formulas for including
their contribution in the recurrence spectra by going beyond the usual stationary phase approximation employed in
the standard form of closed-orbit theory. The formulas will be tested versus exact quantum calculations for diﬀerent
model atomic and molecular systems in an external magnetic ﬁeld. The two orbits that will be dealt with speciﬁcally
are the orbit perpendicular to the ﬁeld, which should not be excited when it lies in the node of a wavefunction, and
the orbit parallel to the ﬁeld, which does not exist classically when the electron’s angular momentum projection on
the ﬁeld axis Lz is non-vanishing (since the Hamiltonian remains divergent on the z axis even after regularization).
The contribution of orbits lying in the node of a wave-function was ﬁrst observed by Shaw et al. [7] when comparing
quantum and semiclassical calculations for the diamagnetic hydrogen atom in the near-integrable regime (scaled
0.7). They obtained a formula for including the ﬁrst-order forbidden contribution of the perpendicular
energies ǫ

orbit, which appeared as a small feature in the recurrence spectra. In non-hydrogenic systems, we can expect the
eﬀects associated with “forbidden” orbits to be far more important than in hydrogen given that core-scattering mixes
the contributions of diﬀerent orbits. Moreover, although it may have been expected that at higher scaled energy
the contribution of on-node orbits would become insigniﬁcant (as the classical amplitudes decrease), we will see that
their inclusion is necessary to account for the correct amplitude in the modulations produced by orbits which have
bifurcated from them. The existence of recurrences produced by “non-existing” orbits on the ﬁeld axis was reported
for Rydberg atoms in an electric ﬁeld by Robicheaux and Shaw [8], who developed a heuristic formula which yielded
a poor agreement between semiclassical and quantum calculations. We will derive a formula for appropriately taking
into account such classically forbidden orbits and compare it to quantum calculations in the case of an external
magnetic ﬁeld. In passing we will also show that the contribution of the parallel orbit when it is allowed (i.e., for
Lz = 0) can be obtained by treating it as any other orbit, provided a higher order reﬁned stationary phase integration
is used (whereas the parallel orbit has always been treated as a special case, following the original derivation given
by Gao and Delos [9]).

The paper is organized as follows. We recall in Sec. II the usual semiclassical formulas of closed-orbit theory (with
provision for multichannel core scattering). Sec. III details the derivation of the contribution to the photoabsorption
spectra of the ﬁrst-order forbidden orbits. We report in Sec. IV quantum and semiclassical calculations for diﬀerent
values of the quantum defects, scaled energies or magnetic ﬁeld ranges, focusing on the contribution of those forbidden
orbits. We give our conclusions in Sec. V.

II. OVERVIEW OF STANDARD MULTICHANNEL CLOSED-ORBIT THEORY

Closed-orbit theory explains the dynamics underlying the photoabsorption spectra of Rydberg atoms or molecules
in external ﬁelds in terms of closed orbits: following initial photo-excitation, the wavefunction of the excited electron
propagates ﬁrst in a region near the ionic core (“inner region”), in which the external ﬁeld can be neglected. Beyond
the inner region, the wave-function is propagated semiclassically along classical trajectories. Some trajectories return
to the inner region, and the semiclassical wavefunction carried by those trajectories is matched to an exact wave-
function in the inner region given by a standard (ﬁeld-free) multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) expansion.
The superposition of these returning waves with the initially dipole-excited wavefunction produces sinusoidal modu-
lations in the photoabsoprtion spectrum, which appear as isolated peaks in the Fourier-transformed (“recurrence”)
spectrum. Further modulations (i.e., peaks in the recurrence spectrum) are caused by the core-scattering process; in
a multichannel problem, the electron can exchange energy and angular momenta with the core, so after the collision
the electron wavefunction propagates outward again, and when it leaves the inner region the wavefunction will follow
once again classical trajectories. If the collision was perfectly elastic, the electron will follow one of the previously
followed trajectories; on the other hand, inelastic collisions will result in trajectories pertaining to a diﬀerent classical
regime.

In Ref.

[4] we described in detail photoabsorption from a ground state diatomic molecule in a static magnetic
ﬁeld. After photoexcitation, the molecular core could either be rotationally excited (N = 2) or non-excited (N = 0,
where N is the core angular momentum). The molecular core then plays the role of an eﬀective 2-level scatterer
which combines classical trajectories belonging to 2 diﬀerent dynamical regimes (typically, chaotic and near-integrable
regimes), thereby producing additional modulations in the photoabsorption spectrum. The way these combinations
occur depends both on the classical characteristics (amplitude Ak and action Sk of the kth trajectory), and on the
properties of the scatterer (which is given by the scattering transition matrix, T ). Scaled energy spectroscopy consists
2/3
of simultaneously varying the magnetic ﬁeld strength γ and the laser excitation frequency so as to keep ǫ = Eγ−
constant, where E is the energy of the Rydberg electron; ǫ is the scaled energy, which depends on the core state
j through the energy partition between the core and the outer electron. Although scaling for molecules is only
approximate, we have seen in [4] how a molecular system can be scaled conveniently; ~eﬀ will stand for γ1/3, since the
ﬁeld strength plays the rˆole of the Planck constant [10]. The absorption rate in the one core-scatter approximation is
then given by [see Eq. (3.30) in [4]]

The notation has been completely detailed in Sec. III of [4], but in short: j (and j′) is a compound index accounting
for the core-electron couplings when the electron dynamics has uncoupled from the core. If we assume H2 as the

−

prototype molecule, the initial state has the quantum numbers J = 0, l = 0 (J is the total angular momentum, l the
orbital momentum of the outer electron), the sum over j runs over the core states N = 0, MN = M and N = 2,
1, M, M + 1 where MN is the projection of N on the ﬁeld axis; M, the projection of the total angular
MN = M
momentum on the ﬁeld axis, is the only quantum number conserved throughout the entire physical process. α gives
the set of quantum numbers in the molecular frame, when the electron is coupled to the molecular axis; the sum runs
here on Λ = 0 (Σ state) and Λ = 1 (Π state); µΣ and µΠ are the corresponding short-range molecular quantum defects.

approximation, known to be valid for H2, we have CΣ = 1 and CΠ = √2.

a single quantum defect µl=1 (by setting µΣ = µΠ = µl=1; the T matrix is then diagonal).

III. CONTRIBUTION OF FIRST-ORDER FORBIDDEN ORBITS

A. General remarks

j
Although Eqs. (1) and (2) predict that if ˜
k(ǫj) vanishes, the orbit k should not contribute to the recurrence
R
spectrum, we had observed in [4] a mismatch between semiclassical and quantum classical calculations for molecules
in ﬁelds in the amplitude of certain peaks in the recurrence spectrum. This mismatch was interpreted as arising
from the interference of the orbit perpendicular to the ﬁeld (which lies on the node of a spherical harmonic when
M = 0 and is thus semiclassically forbidden) with the R1
2 “pac-man” orbit. As stated, the recurrences associated with
classical orbits lying in the node of a wavefunction were ﬁrst observed by Shaw et al. [7] when comparing quantum
and semiclassical calculations for the diamagnetic hydrogen atom at low scaled energies (ǫ
0.7). They obtained a
formula for the contribution of the perpendicular orbit by matching the returning semiclassical wave to an “ansatz” (a
rotated ﬁrst order Bessel function). In this section we shall derive simply the contribution to the oscillator strength of
this type of ﬁrst-order suppressed orbit by employing the same framework introduced in Sec. II, without introducing
additional assumptions; only the stationary phase integration needs to be performed diﬀerently. We will also derive a
formula to account for the peaks in the m = 1 recurrence spectra appearing at the scaled action of the m = 0 parallel
j
= 0 and there is therefore no corresponding ˜
k(ǫj)
orbit, since the parallel orbit does not exist classically when Lz 6

factor. Numerical results and examples will be given in Sec. IV.

B. Contribution of on-node suppressed orbits

The rationale for including the contribution of orbits lying on the node of a wavefunction was already given in [7]:
strictly speaking, an orbit k closed at the core with initial and returning angles θik and θf k is not isolated, but has
neighboring orbits which are not closed at the origin. We assume a neighboring orbit returns with an angle ¯θf and
envisage the initial angle ¯θi of this orbit to be a function of ¯θf , i.e., ¯θi = θ(¯θf ). To ﬁrst order in ¯θf −

θf k we have

Ylj mj (¯θi) = Ylj mj (θik) +

Y ∗lj mj (¯θf ) = Y ∗lj mj (θf k) +

In the usual case, the contribution of the neighboring orbits with initial and ﬁnal angles (¯θi, ¯θf ) is negligible when
compared to the central orbit with angles (θik, θf k). However, when the central orbit lies on a node of a spherical
harmonic, the semiclassical wave-function can only be carried by the neighboring orbits, and this contribution can be
signiﬁcant provided the classical density of trajectories is suﬃciently large on return to the core.

It turns out that, to ﬁrst order in ¯θf −

θf k, such a contribution comes into play if we have both Ylj mj (θik) = 0 and
Y ∗lj mj (θf k) = 0. If k is such an orbit, its contribution to the outgoing wave ψNj mj
[Eq. (4)] vanishes. The contribution
of the neighboring orbits are taken into account by inserting Eq. (8) in Eq. (4) and Eq. (9) in Eq. (7); the right
hand-side of Eq. (7) then takes the form:

This formula holds for non-vanishing angles. Specializing to our atomic and molecular model described above, we
have l = 1, so this formula only applies to the orbit perpendicular to the ﬁeld (θik = θf k = π/2) for the m = 0
manifolds (e.g., for a molecule, when M = 0, for an outer electron associated with core states having a projection
MN = 0). Note that in the absence of core-eﬀects, Eq. (10) becomes strictly equivalent to the correction obtained in
[7] for the hydrogen atom.

C. Contribution of the “classically non-existing” parallel orbit

1. Contribution of the parallel orbit when Lz = 0

We ﬁrst recall that the orbit parallel to the ﬁeld (θik = θf k = 0) classically exists if Lz = 0. Even then, this orbit is
treated as a special case, because the formulas valid for the other orbits, Eqs. (1) and (2), need to be modiﬁed. This
modiﬁcation was originally obtained by matching the semiclassical returning wave to a particular Bessel function on
the z axis [9]. We show here that the reason this orbit is “special” is that the standard stationary phase approximation
1/2 in the outgoing wave (3), the expression to be integrated
vanishes. Indeed, setting
→ |
arising from the matching condition Eq. (7) is

sin θik/ sin θf k|

which is zero in the standard stationary phase approximation. However, an approximate closed form may be obtained
(see Appendix B). To ﬁrst order in ~, we have

orbit, which is apparent from its ~-dependence.

2. Contribution of the parallel orbit when Lz 6= 0

When Lz is non-vanishing the diamagnetic Hamiltonian contains the repulsive term proportional to ˜L2

z/ ˜ρ2, where
˜Lz = γ1/3Lz is the scaled angular momentum and ˜ρ = γ2/3ρ the scaled distance from the z axis [10]. Even though
in the semiclassical limit ˜Lz is small (since heﬀ ≡
0), the centrifugal term is inﬁnite on the z axis, and the
→
parallel orbit no longer exists [12]. However, we may expect orbits neighboring the z axis and not closed at the
nucleus to contribute to the oscillator strength, in the same manner as for the on-node orbit (orbits near the z axis
0 where actually investigated in [12]). Starting from Eqs. (8) and
= 0 and their structural stability as Lz →
for Lz 6

FIG. 2: General view of the recurrence spectrum for a molecule with the set of quantum defects µΣ = −0.3, µΠ = 0.1, M = 0,
at ǫN=0 = −0.3 and ǫN=2 = −0.8 in the range γ−1/3 = [60, 120]. The semiclassical result (bottom) has been calculated in the

factor ~1/2 relative to a typical orbit, and the forbidden parallel by a factor ~ relative to the classically allowed parallel
orbit and ~3/2 relative to a typical orbit. This is to be contrasted with the core-scattered (“diﬀractive”) orbits: each
encounter with the core brings in for a typical orbit a factor ~1/2. Thus single core-scattering is expected to dominate
the photoabsorption spectrum in the semiclassical regime; however, the ~ dependence is balanced by the amplitude
factors, explaining why for individual orbits the forbidden contribution may be strong, as will be seen below.
It
may also be noted that the combination of orbits having diﬀerent individual ~ dependence through core-scattering
[last term in Eq. (1)] will give rise to peaks in the recurrence spectra with a dependence of the form ~ν/2, where
ν is an integer depending on the type of primitive orbits connected by the core-scattering process. In particular,
core-scattering between two forbidden parallel orbits is expected to be highly suppressed in the semiclassical limit.

IV. RESULTS

We compare below quantum and semiclassical calculations to assess the importance of the forbidden orbits in the
recurrence spectra of atoms and molecules. The numerical examples given in this section correspond to non-hydrogenic
atoms and diﬀerent molecules obtained by choosing diﬀerent sets of quantum defects, within the framework of the
model described in Sec. II.

0.7, in the range
Fig. 1 displays the recurrence spectrum of a non-hydrogenic atom with µl=1 = 0.5, M = 0, at ǫ =
1/3 = [60, 120]. The top ﬁgure gives the quantum calculation, whereas the solid line in the bottom part of the plot
γ−
results from the standard semiclassical treatment; this solid line only accounts for less than half of the peaks in the
recurrence spectrum. The missing peaks relative to the quantum results arise from the orbit R1 perpendicular to the
ﬁeld (and its nth repetition Rn) — which lies on the node of the wavefunction and is thus not excited according to
the standard treatment — as well as from the combinations produced by core-scattering between Rn and the parallel
orbit and between the on-node orbits. The broken line includes the contribution of the on-node orbit [Eq. (12)] in
the semiclassical calculation.

At higher scaled energies, the contribution of the forbidden Rn orbit is visible through the mismatch observed in
[4] between the height of the peaks in the quantum and semiclassical recurrence spectra. Fig. 2 displays a global
view of the recurrence spectrum for a molecule with the set of quantum defects µΣ =
0.3, µΠ = 0.1, M = 0, at
1/3 = [60, 120]. These quantum defects yield a balanced contribution of
ǫN =0 =
the diﬀerent type of orbits: the primitive geometric orbits (that is the orbits that appear in the recurrence spectrum
of the hydrogen atom), the elastic scattered diﬀractive orbits (that appear in the recurrence spectra of non-hydrogenic
atoms and in molecules) and the inelastic scattered diﬀractive orbits (that solely appear in molecular systems). In
Figs. 3–5, we zoom on some individual peaks in the recurrence spectra, choosing diﬀerent sets of quantum defects but
keeping the other parameters (scaled energies, γ range) constant, to observe the presence of the on-node orbit and
how its interplay with core-scattering aﬀects the amplitude of the recurrence peaks.

FIG. 3: Recurrence spectra for non-hydrogenic atoms with µl=1 = 0.5 [a], µl=1 = 0.25 [b] and µl=1 = 0.1 [c]. The left panel
represents the peak labelled 3 in Fig. 2, the right panel shows the combination peak 1 + 3 (the amplitude of the 1 + 3 peak has
been multiplied by 3 relative to the amplitude of the peak on the left panel). For each peak, the quantum result (top) is plotted
versus semiclassical calculations (upside-down) without (solid line) and with (broken line) the higher order contributions.

1 “balloon” orbit (peak 1) and R1
the same scaled action), and 1 + 3 results from the combination of the V 1
2 through
core-scattering. The mismatch for the peak 3 arises from interference between the contributions of the R1
2 and the
on-node R2 orbit; indeed, including the on-node orbit in the semiclassical calculations results in excellent agreement
with the quantum result. The peak 3 thus results from the interference of primitive orbits and accordingly does not
depend on the value of the quantum defect; however the peak 1 + 3 does depend on the quantum defect and vanishes
0; the contribution of the on-node orbit in 1 + 3 is seen to be important (in absolute terms) only
in the limit µl=1 →
provided the quantum defect is large. Note that in principle we should also have taken into account the ﬁrst and
third repetitions of the perpendicular orbit, but their corresponding amplitudes are very small, so these orbits have
a negligible contribution to the recurrence spectra.

The situation depicted in Fig. 4 is more involved: a close up of the peak at ˜S = 3.9 (labelled 3 + 3 in Fig. 2)
is shown for a molecule with quantum defects µΣ = 0.5, µΠ = 0 [a] and µΣ = 0.5, µΠ = 0.5 [b]; the peak 3 + 3
arises from recurrences produced by diﬀerent orbits: the second return of R1
2 and the fourth return R4 of the on-node
perpendicular orbit, the combinations R1
2 +R2 and R2 +R2 via core-scattering. The resulting peak amplitude
depends both on the quantum defects (which rule the core-scattering amplitudes) and on the inclusion of the two on-
node orbits: in the ﬁrst case the standard semiclassical result underestimates the exact quantum calculation, whereas
in Fig. 4 (b) the standard semiclassical result overestimates the correct recurrence strength. Adding the contribution
of the on-node orbits in the semiclassical treatment results in both cases in a better agreement with the quantum
calculations.

Finally, Fig. 6 shows a portion of the recurrence spectrum for the hydrogen atom at ǫ =

0.55, M = 1, in the
1/3 = [30, 240]. We have zoomed the peaks at ˜S = 0.95 and ˜S = 1.91 which are due to the ﬁrst and second
range γ−
returns of the classically “non-existing” forbidden parallel orbit. Note that the peak at ˜S = 0.95 sits on the right
shoulder of the much stronger R1 orbit, whereas the second return at ˜S = 1.91 is suﬃciently isolated. The quantum
calculation for M = 1 thus displays peaks for orbits which classically “do not exist”, at the actions of the corresponding
M = 0 parallel orbit. The standard semiclassical treatment (solid line) can not obviously account for those peaks,
but including Eq. (17), which takes into account higher order contributions, yields an excellent agreement with the
quantum results, since those forbidden orbits contribute, albeit modestly, to the photoabsorption spectrum.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The feature developed in this paper is one of the many reﬁnements that can be undertaken to improve a semiclassical
formalism such as closed orbit theory. Some processes are forbidden on purely classical grounds (e.g., the above-barrier
reﬂection of excited lithium in an electric ﬁeld which results in very broad resonances in the absorption spectrum [13])
whereas other processes are semiclassically distorted (e.g., diverging amplitudes at bifurcations).

The rˆole of the perpendicular on-node orbit was ﬁrst observed in calculations for the diamagnetic hydrogen atom
at low scaled energy (ǫ
0.7) [7]. Subsequent high-resolution experiments on helium in a magnetic ﬁeld in the
same dynamical regime did not clearly detect the on-node orbits (they were within the experimental noise) [14]. We
have given a simpler derivation of the contribution of these ﬁrst-order suppressed orbits, and our numerical results
indicate that on-node orbits are more likely to be detected in non-hydrogenic atomic or molecular systems with strong
quantum defects. At low scaled energies, peaks resulting from the core-scattering of the on-node orbit with a strong

FIG. 6: Recurrence spectrum for the hydrogen atom at ǫ = −0.55, M = 1, in the range γ−1/3 = [30, 240]. The plot focuses on
the ﬁrst and second repetitions of the ﬁrst-order suppressed “parallel” orbit, which is clearly visible on the quantum calculations
(top). This feature is absent from the standard semiclassical calculations (bottom, solid line), but the inclusion of the higher
order contributions (bottom, broken line) results in an excellent agreement with the quantum calculations. Note that the
peak at ˜S = 0.95 sits on the right shoulder of the much stronger R1 orbit; the oscillations are due to the ﬁnite range of the
Welch-windowed Fourier transform.

allowed orbit could be more easily detected; at higher scaled energies, the on-node orbit is most likely to aﬀect the
amplitude of peaks due to typical allowed orbits.

The presence of contributions in the quantum photoabsorption spectra which were not correlated with any classical
orbit was observed in calculations for non-hydrogenic atoms with m
= 0 in an electric ﬁeld by Robicheaux and Shaw
[8]; these contributions were coined “recurrences without closed orbits” because they appear at the scaled action of
the parallel orbit which only exists classically when Lz = 0 and should therefore be absent in an m
= 0 recurrence
spectrum. These authors also gave an ad-hoc semiclassical formula akin to the on-node correction which resulted in
a poor agreement with the quantum calculations. Main [15] later pointed out that, for small but nonvanishing Lz,
periodic orbits having nearly the same action as the Lz = 0 parallel orbit do exist; it was unclear however whether
the “recurrences without closed orbits” could be attributed to such orbits, in particular because the starting point
of these orbits is several atomic units away from the core. Our formula Eq. (17) correctly accounts for the peaks in
the recurrence spectrum associated with these apparently non-existing orbits; the ~ dependence is diﬀerent to that
of the suppressed on-node orbits. The physical picture is similar in both cases: just as Eq. (12) accounts for close
neighbors to the on-node orbit, which are not closed at the origin but carry a portion of the wavefunction back to
the core region, Eq. (17) takes into account non-radial orbits close to the z axis which also give rise to recurrences by
carrying the wavefunction from and into the core region.

To conclude, we have seen that ﬁrst-order forbidden processes can be included within Closed-orbit theory in a
simple and uniﬁed manner by elementary manipulations of the stationary phase integral, which yield a higher-order
~ dependence. In passing, we have shown that the zero degree orbit, which has always required special treatment,
is in fact a case calling for a reﬁned stationary phase integration. Analogous manipulations of the stationary phase
integral of the Green’s function were performed in [16] to obtain an improved semiclassical long-range scattering
matrix for Rydberg atoms in ﬁelds. Our method provides a convenient and eﬀective way of including non-radial and
non-closed trajectories that nevertheless contribute to the photoabsorption spectra of Rydberg atoms and molecules
in ﬁelds without the need to to calculate explicitly the involved classical dynamics of those trajectories. The validity
of the method was assessed by comparing our semiclassical results to quantum calculations for Rydberg atoms and
molecules in an external magnetic ﬁeld.

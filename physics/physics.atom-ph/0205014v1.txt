Abstract. We demonstrate the in situ detection of cold 87Rb atoms near a dielectric surface using the
absorption of a weak, resonant evanescent wave. We have used this technique in time of ﬂight experiments
determining the density of atoms falling on the surface. A quantitative understanding of the measured
curve was obtained using a detailed calculation of the evanescent intensity distribution. We have also
used it to detect atoms trapped near the surface in a standing-wave optical dipole potential. This trap
was loaded by inelastic bouncing on a strong, repulsive evanescent potential. We estimate that we trap
1.5 × 104 atoms at a density 100 times higher than the falling atoms.

1 Introduction

2 Evanescent wave calculations

Recently there has been increased interest in cold atoms
trapped near a surface. For example magnetic ﬁelds of
micro-electronic structures are used to trap and guide
atoms near the surface of so-called atom chips [1,2,3]. Last
year Bose-Einstein condensation was realized on such a
chip [4,5]. Other examples are experiments aiming to in-
crease the phase space density and create a quasi 2D gas of
atoms using inelastic reﬂections from an evanescent-wave
(EW) atomic mirror [6,7,8].

These experiments pose new challenges for in situ de-
tection, in particular if the atoms are within the order of
an optical wavelength from the surface. In this case ab-
sorption of EW’s is advantageous, since only atoms that
are within a few wavelengths from the surface are probed.
Aspect et al. have proposed the nondestructive detection
of atoms close to a surface by detecting a phase change
of a far detuned EW [9]. However this eﬀect is very small
and has not been observed so far. In this letter we demon-
strate experimentally the absorption of resonant evanes-
cent waves as a novel diagnostic tool to study cold atoms
near a dielectric surface. Using a weak, resonant EW, we
have studied a sample of cold atoms falling onto the sur-
face as well as atoms trapped close to the surface.

EW absorption has previously been used for spectros-
copy on hot and dense atomic vapors to experimentally
investigate EW properties such as Goos-H¨anchen shift [10,
11].

An evanescent wave appears when a light wave undergoes
total internal reﬂection at the surface of a dielectric with
index of refraction n. For a plane incident wave the optical
ﬁeld on the vacuum side of the surface decays exponen-
z/ξ) with z the direction perpendicular to
tially
exp(
1)−1/2 the decay length,
the surface, ξ(θ) = λ
n the index of refraction of the substrate and θ the angle
of incidence. For a low density of resonant absorbers near
the surface, the scattering rate in the low saturation limit
is proportional to the square of the ﬁeld:
2z/ξ).
If the density of absorbers is uniform, this gives rise to
a total rate of scattered photons proportional to ξ. The
scattered photons are missing from the reﬂected beam,
which is therefore attenuated. If the angle of incidence ap-
proaches the critical angle θc = arcsin(n−1), the value of ξ
diverges, so the absorption becomes large. The absorption
is however less height selective in this limit.

For a Gaussian beam with an angle of incidence θ0 ≫
θc + φ with θc the critical angle and φ the divergence of
the beam, the electric ﬁeld is similar to the ﬁeld of a plane
wave. For Gaussian beams with θ0 closer to θc, the evanes-
cent ﬁeld does not decay as a simple exponential. We can
describe the incident ﬁeld as a superposition of plane wave
Fourier components with various θ. Each component con-
tributes an evanescent ﬁeld component with decay length
ξ(θ) and an amplitude proportional to the complex Fresnel
transmission coeﬃcient t(θ). Because both ξ(θ) and t(θ)
vary strongly around θc, the evanescent wave contribu-
tions of these incident plane wave components add up to
a non exponentially decaying ﬁeld. In addition the trans-
verse beam proﬁle is modiﬁed to a non Gaussian shape.
In the reﬂected beam one of the eﬀects is the well known

Goos-H¨anchen shift [12]. Other phenomena like nonspecu-
lar reﬂection, shift of focus point and change of beam waist
have been predicted [13]. They all result from combining a
ﬁnite size beam with angle dependence of the transmission
coeﬃcient t(θ). Recently, it has been proposed to measure
a Goos-H¨anchen shift also in the evanescent wave using a
scanning tunneling optical microscope (STOM) [14].

In the following calculations we will coherently add
plane wave components with propagation vectors in the
plane of incidence. The transverse distribution has been
assumed Gaussian with the same radius as the incident
beam at the surface. This approach is valid, since the
transverse components of the propagation vector change
the angle of incidence only in second order.

The evanescent ﬁeld has been calculated by evaluating

In a ﬁrst experiment we use evanescent wave absorption
to detect a cloud of cold atoms falling on a glass surface.
Our setup consists of a right angle, uncoated, BK7 prism,
mounted inside a vacuum cell with a background Rb pres-
sure of 10−7
10−8 mbar. About 2
107 87Rb atoms
are captured from the background gas in a magneto op-
tical trap (MOT), located 7 mm above the prism surface
and are subsequently cooled to 4.5 µK in optical molasses.
They are released in the F=2 hyperﬁne ground state and
fall towards the prism due to gravity. Inside the prism a
weak, resonant, p-polarized probe beam undergoes total
internal reﬂection. Its angle of incidence was determined
with 100 µrad accuracy by a method that will be discussed
later. The probe beam has a waist of 330 µm (1/e2 radius)
resulting in a divergence of 500 µrad inside the prism. At
the prism surface it has a waist (1/e2 intensity radius) of
(470
20) µm. The total power of the incident beam is
Pin = 2.2 µW.

We measure the absorption in the reﬂected wave on a
photodiode which is ampliﬁed by a factor 106 by a fast,
low noise current ampliﬁer (Femto HCA-1M-1M). A typ-
ical absorption trace is shown in the inset of Fig. 2a. The
maximum absorption of time traces for diﬀerent values of
the angle of incidence are plotted in Fig. 2a. From this
graph it is clear that the absorption is highest for angles
of incidence very close to the critical angle. In order to
analyze these results we consider the atomic density to
be uniform perpendicular to the surface, since the pene-
tration of the EW (< 10 µm) is much smaller than the
size of the cloud (
1 mm). It is crucial to take the ﬁ-
nite probe beam diameter into account. This leads to a
ﬁnite range of angles of incidence so that the EW is no
longer exponential as described above. We deﬁne an ef-
fective decay length ˜ξ by ˜ξ/2 =

We compare our data to the absorption as calculated
using two diﬀerent approaches. The ﬁrst method is to cal-
culate the scattering of evanescent photons by the atoms
near the surface, where we assume that the transmission
coeﬃcients are not changed by the atoms. The scattered
EW ρ(x) s(x)
~ωΓ
power is calculated as 1
s(x)+1 d3x, where

s(x) = 7

is the saturation intensity 1.6 mW/cm2, I(x) is the lo-
cal evanescent intensity, given by Eq. (2), ρ(x) is the local
density, ~ω is the energy of a photon and Γ = 2π
6 MHz
is the natural linewidth. The factor 7
15 appears because
linearly polarized light is used. The integration is over
the entire volume of the evanescent wave. Because the ab-
sorption is so low, Beer’s law remains in its linear regime.
Obviously saturation eﬀects are taken into account. We
also account for the Van der Waals potential, which leads
to a decrease in the atomic density close to the surface. Fi-
nally also the transverse density distribution of the atomic
cloud is taken into account. Neglecting these last three
eﬀects would increase the calculated absorption by ap-
proximately 20%. The open circles in Fig. 2b are the re-
sults of this calculation for a density near the prism of

Close to a dielectric surface the radiative properties of
atoms are altered [15]. The natural linewidth of a two-
level atom can be up to 2.3 times larger than the natural
linewidth in free space. However, including this eﬀect in
the calculations only increased the calculated absorption
by about 2%, which is well within the measurement un-
certainty. By decreasing both the probe intensity and the
decay length this eﬀect should start to play a role.

As a cross check, the second method determines the
absorption by describing the atomic cloud by a complex

not necessary to incorporate the transverse distribution

the results of these calculations for various angles of in-

prism surface of 1.2
plex index of refraction is slightly higher than the absorp-
tion calculated from the scattering of evanescent photons,
mainly because saturation eﬀects were neglected.

4 Trapping

In a second experiment we used evanescent waves to de-
tect atoms trapped close to the surface in a standing light
ﬁeld. We load and trap the atoms using the scheme as
described in previous work [6]. Cold atoms are prepared
as in the time of ﬂight experiment. During their fall the
atoms are optically pumped to the F= 1 hyperﬁne ground
state. On the vacuum side of the prism surface a repul-
sive EW potential is created by total internal reﬂection
of a 90 mW, TM polarized laser beam with a waist of
500 µm and blue detuned by 0.2 - 1 GHz with respect
F’= 2 transition of the D1 line. This
to the F= 1
potential acts as a mirror for atoms. The decay length of
the EW can be controlled by changing the angle of inci-
dence of the laser beam [16]. By scattering EW photons,
the atoms can make a spontaneous Raman transition to
the F=2 hyperﬁne ground state, for which the repulsive
EW potential is lower. This results in a virtually complete
loss of their gravitationally acquired kinetic energy [17].

↔

The trapping laser is a linearly polarized, 1.3W laser
beam, red detuned by about 85 GHz with respect to the
D2 line. It is reﬂected from the vacuum side of the un-
coated prism surface, creating a standing wave (SW) with
a visibility of 0.38. The angle of incidence is nearly nor-
mal, 25 mrad. The spot size at the prism surface is 380 µm
440 µm (1/e2 radii). For atoms in the F=1 hyperﬁne
×
ground state the EW potential is dominant, whereas for
the F=2 hyperﬁne ground state the SW potential is dom-
inant. Atoms that are Raman transferred to F=2 near
their motional turning point can be trapped in the SW
potential. Only a few potential minima will be occupied
due to the highly localized optical scattering of the EW.
When the atoms fall towards the prism both the EW and
the SW are oﬀ. Both are turned on 1 ms before the max-
imum atom density reaches the prism surface. In order to
decrease the scattering rate, the EW is switched oﬀ after
2 ms, after which the loading of the SW trap stops.

The EW probe beam is aligned by overlapping it with
the EW bouncer beam, whose angle can be set with an ac-
curacy of 25 µrad. The overlap could be checked over a dis-
tance of 1.5 m, resulting in an uncertainty in the angle of
100 µrad. During the trapping experiments the probe an-
θc) = 130 µrad
gle of incidence was kept constant at (θ0 −
and the power of the probe beam is Pin = 2.2 µW. At
the prism surface it had a waist (1/e2 intensity radius)
10) µm. The probe was resonant for atoms in

to be certain that no falling atoms were present and only
trapped atoms would be probed.

Since the trap is red detuned, the atoms will be trapped
in the intensity maxima. In the center of the trap the scat-
tering rate in these maxima is calculated to be 7 ms−1 and
the ground state light shift is δLS/2π =
15.4 MHz.
The trap depth here is only 8.6 MHz since the fringe vis-
ibility of the standing wave is 0.38. The trap frequency is
359 kHz, which results in approximately 24 bound levels.
The resonance frequency of trapped atoms is blue-shifted
2δLS, due to the light shift of the excited state.

Fig. 3 shows the absorption of an evanescent probe
beam by atoms trapped in the standing wave. The evanes-
cent wave bouncer is blue detuned by 550 MHz and has
a decay length ξ = 1.15λ. The evanescent probing tech-
nique was used to optimize the trap loading by varying the
bouncer detuning. The maximum absorption is observed
for a detuning of the EW probe of 8 MHz. The measured
linewidth is larger than the 6 MHz atomic linewidth, prob-
ably due to inhomogeneous broadening. There are two
contributions to the broadening. Firstly, since the trap
laser has a Gaussian proﬁle the atoms encounter a spa-
tially varying light shift. Secondly atoms in higher excited
vibrational states will encounter a smaller light shift. It
is not possible to reliably retrieve these detailed distri-
butions from our measured curve. It is however possible
to make a good estimate of the total number of trapped
atoms. The relative absorption curve in Fig. 3 is, for low
saturation, described by

Eq. (4) over the detuning δ (the area under the curve of
Fig. 3), the integration of the Lorentzian over δ yields
πΓ/2. The integration over ∆, for which the integrand is
now only ˜ρ(x, ∆), yields the density of atoms ρ(x).

×

From comparing the kinetic energy of the falling atoms
in F = 1 to the trap depth when the atoms are pumped
to F = 2, it follows that mainly the third and fourth
potential minima will be populated. An underestimate of
the number of atoms can be obtained by assuming the
probe intensity constant over the trap region (which is
valid if the evanescent probe size is much larger than the
trap size) and all atoms are in the third minimum. Eq.
(4) then reduces to (π~ωΓ 2s3)/4Pin)N , with N the total
number of trapped atoms and where s3 denotes the sat-
uration parameter in the third potential minimum. From
this a number of trapped atoms in the F = 2 hyperﬁne
103 can be calculated after 14 ms
ground state of 3.0
of trapping. The total number of trapped atoms will be
103 because the steady state F = 1 groundstate
4.5
population will be 0.5 times the F = 2 population due to
scattering by the standing wave with the present detuning.
The populations of the magnetic sublevels of one hyperﬁne
groundstate are equal to within 1%. By comparison with
previous measurements we deduce a lifetime of 14.3 ms.
104 trapped atoms
An extrapolation results in about 1.2
at t = 0. The assumption that the evanescent probe size is
much larger than the trap size is not completely valid. Tak-
ing the correct radii into account leads to a 22% increase,
104 trapped atoms. Assuming the transverse
thus 1.5
trap distribution equal to the trapping laser, the vertical
trap radius to be λ/4 and the atoms to be distributed
mainly over two potential minima, the density becomes
1011 cm−3, which is about 100 times higher than the
1.2
density of the atoms falling onto the prism.

5 Conclusions and outlook

∼

We have shown that the absorption of a weak, resonant
evanescent wave can be used to selectively detect cold
atoms near (
λ) a dielectric surface. A model treating the
absorption by scattering evanescent photons was suitable
to describe the absorption. When caculating the evanes-
cent intensity distribution, the Gaussian character of the
incident beam had to be taken into account in order to
quantitatively understand the absorption for angles of in-
cidence very close to the critical angle.

By detecting cold atoms falling onto the dielectric sur-
face for diﬀerent angles of incidence of the probe beam we
have veriﬁed our quantitative description of the depen-
dence of the absorption on the angle of incidence of the
probe beam. By detecting cold atoms trapped in stand-
ing wave potential minima close to the surface we have
104
determined that we have trapped more than 1.5
atoms initially. This results in an increase of the density
of two orders of magnitude with respect to the approach-
ing atoms.

era so that a transverse distribution of the atoms can be

gles of incidence of the probe beam, it should be possible
to obtain information about the distribution of atoms per-
pendicular to the surface.

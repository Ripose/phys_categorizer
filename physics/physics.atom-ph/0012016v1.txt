In this work we study the energy exchange between an atomic system and a thermal

radiation ﬁeld, using the Dalibard, Dupont-Roc and Cohen-Tannoudji (DDC) construct, in-

corporating temperature eﬀects to the eigenstates of the radiation ﬁeld operator through the

electromagnetic propagator of Thermo Field Dynamics in the Coulomb gauge. We also discuss

the stability of the atomic system at ﬁnite temperature.

Introduction

Since the 70’s, it has been argued[1][2] that the physical interpretation of radiative phenomena,

in particlar the shift in atomic energy levels, rely upon diﬀerent choices in the ordering of

atomic and ﬁeld operators in the interaction Hamiltonian.

Latter, Dalibard, Dupont-Roc and Cohen-Tannoudji (DDC)[3] considered the interaction

between a nonrelativistic atomic electron and the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, showing

that such arbitrariness can be removed by requiring that the corresponding variation rates

must be Hermitian, if we want them to have a “physical meaning”. They generalized this

procedure to the case of a small sistem S interacting with a large reservoir R (which may be

in thermal equilibrium). This construct allowed them to separate the physical processes in

two cathegories, those where R ﬂuctuates and polarizes S (eﬀects of reservoir ﬂuctuations),

and those where S polarizes R (eﬀects of self-reaction or radiation reaction).

In the present work we are interested in analyzing the implementation of temperature in

the context of DDC formalism, where the statistical functions, which are deﬁned from two-

point functions of physical observables, play a fundamental role. These functions enable us

to obtain expressions, up to second order in perturbation theory, in terms of products of

correlation functions and susceptibilities[4].

The implementation of temperature[3] can be made directly in such statistical functions

using the equipartition theorem, leading to a ﬁnite temperature description of the relevant

phenomena.

In an alternative way, we shall study the theory using Umezawa’s formalism, known as

Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD)[5]. In TFD, the quantum statistical average of an observable

in a given ensemble is identiﬁed with its expectation value in a thermal vacuum.

In this

approach, the temperature is incorporeted from the beginning, in the eigenstate of the number

operator associated to the radiation ﬁeld.

Our ideia is to investigate the thermal propagator of electromagnetic ﬁeld in the Coulomb

gauge and to identify the correlation functions and susceptibilities of DDC formalism. We

compare our results in the case of energy exchange between an atomic system and a thermal

reservoir, analysing their implication to atomic stability.

II. Radiation considered as a Reservoir

In the Dalibard, Dupont-Roc and Cohen-Tannoudji[3] formalism, the interaction between an

atom and the free electromagnetic ﬁeld can be seen as the interaction of a microscopic system

S with a large reservoir R, in the sense that R has many degrees of freedom and the correlation

time between the observables of R is small, allowing a perturbative treatment of the eﬀect

due to the coupling of S and R. In this context, the Hamiltonian of the global system S + R,

can be written as

H = Hs + HR + V,

where Hs is the Hamiltonian of S, HR the reservoir Hamiltonian and V the interaction Hamil-

tonian, which we assume to be of the form V = −

i RiSi, where Ri and Si are Hermitian

observables of R and S.

P

In the interaction representation with respect to Hs + HR, the density operator of the

global system ρ(t) evolve according to

d
dt

1
i¯h

˜ρ(t) =

[ ˜V (t), ˜ρ(t)].

Here, the reservoir stands for the radiation ﬁeld. In the case we are interested, R represents

the electromagnetic ﬁeld so that we may choose the observables Ri as the space components

of the vector potential of the electromagnetic ﬁeld Ai, i = x, y, z. Under these circumstances,

it is easy to verify that the average value of Ri in a state σR of the reservoir is zero, i.e.,

T r [σRR(t)] = T r

σR ˜R(t)
h

i

= 0,

since Ri and Ai are linear combinations of emission and absorption operators of radiation

quanta.

Expression (3) is a one-time average. Now consider a two-time average

σR ˜R(t′) ˜R(t′′)
h
This two-point function represents an average in a state σR of a product of two observables

g(t′, t′′) = T r

taken at two diﬀerent times t′ and t′′.

In fact, such two-point function depends only on

τ = t′ − t′′ because, due to the cyclic permutation property of the trace,

g(t′, t′′) = T rR

σR ˜R(τ ) ˜R(0)

= g(τ ).

Assuming that σR is a stationary state, it follows that [σR, HR] = 0. As a consequence, we

can expand σR as

where |µi is an eigenstate of HR with eigenvalue Eµ and pµ is a given statistical weight. Note

that, when the whole system is in thermal equilibrium at temperature T , we may assume that

the equipartition theorem applies and take

where kB is the Boltzmann constant. Substituting (6) into (5), we obtain

where Rµν = hµ|R|νi, ωµν = ωµ − ων and ωµ = Eµ/¯h.

Equation (8) is a superposition of exponentials oscillating at diﬀerent Bohr frequencies ωµν

of R. Because R is a reservoir, it has a very dense ensemble of energy levels and, consequently,

a quasi-continuous spectrum of Bohr frequencies, so that the exponentials in (8) interfere

destructively once τ becomes large enough.

The hipoteses made about R are equivalent to assuming that R is in a stationary state

and exerts on S a “force” ﬂuctuating about a zero average value with a short correlation time

τc.

A. The Statistical Functions

The function g(τ ) deﬁned in (4) is not real, even to Hermitian operators R, because, in general,
˜R(τ ) and ˜R(0) do not commute. In order to separate the real and imaginary parts of g(τ ) we

4

write

g(τ ) =

h{ ˜R(τ ), ˜R(0)}iR +

h[ ˜R(τ ), ˜R(0)/i]iR ,

1
2

i
2

where h, iR indicates an average on the reservoir state deﬁned by σR. The ﬁrst term in (9)
corresponds to the symmetric correlation function and the second is related to the linear

susceptibilities of the reservoir. The symmetric correlation function of the observable R,

CR(τ ) =

h{ ˜R(t′), ˜R(t′′)}iR,

1
2

is real and tends to the ordinary correlation function in the classical limit. It gives a physical

description of the dynamics of the ﬂuctuations of the observable R in the state σR.

The explicit expression for the quantum correlation function deﬁned by (10) is given by

the real part of expression (8) for g(τ ),

In the frequence space (11) becomes

CR(τ ) =

pµ|Rµν|2 cos(ωµντ ) .

X

ˆCR(ω) =

pµπ|Rµν|2[δ(ω + ωµν) + δ(ω − ωµν)] .

The other statistical function is the linear susceptibility χR(τ ), which characterizes the

reservoir response to an external perturbation,

χR(τ ) =

B. Atomic Transition

Let S be an atom ﬁxed at the origin 0 of the coordinate system and R an homogeneous and

isotropic broadband radiation ﬁeld. The radiation density operator is, according to (6), a

statistical mixture of the eigenstates |n1 . . . nk . . . i of HR, representing n1 quanta in the mode

1,...,nk quanta in the mode k..., with a weight p(n1 . . . nk . . .),

σR =

p(. . . nk . . .)| . . . nk . . . ihn1 . . . nk . . . | .

X{nk}

The average number of quanta in the mode k is, therefore, given by

hnki =

nkp(n1 . . . nk . . .).

X{nk}

Since it depends only on ωk, we hereafter use the notation hn(ωk)i.

In order to simplify the problem, let us consider a model where an atom with a single

electron, moving in a spherically symmetric potential around the center (r = 0). Further,

assuming that the electron is inside a volume having small dimensions compared with the

wavelenght of the incident radiation, we can make use of the long wavelength approximatiom

to all modes whose frequence is bellow a cutoﬀ ωM . In this case, the Hamiltonian of the global

system is given by (1) and the interaction Hamiltonian between the atom and the ﬁeld reduces

to the expression1

In order to study phenomena at ﬁnite temperature, we may substitute the average number

of radiation quanta hni, which appear in (24), by the Bose-Einstein distribution function[3].

This procedure is justiﬁed by the use of (7) and accounts for the equipartition theorem for the

modes of the radiation ﬁeld.

III. Thermal Correlation Functions and Susceptibilities

In this section we study the thermal propagator of electromagnetic ﬁeld in the context of

Thermal Field Dynamics (TFD). Our ideia is to obtain the statistical functions CR and χR,

implementing temperature in a criterious way. We start by writing the space components of

the electromagnetic potential A i(t) as2

where A(+)

i (t) and A(−)

i (t) are the components with positive and negative frequence, deﬁned,

respectively, as

with

In TFD we double the ﬁeld degrees of freedom introducing the tilde conjugated of A i(t)

[5][6]. Using the thermal doublet notation[6][7], we obtain

A i(t) =

A i(t)
˜A i(t) !

 

¯A i(t) = ( A i(t), − ˜A i(t) )

(35)

2As in the last section, we assume that the atom is at rest at the origin of the coordinate system (r = 0)

and that we are using the dipole approximation.

At zero temperature, the vacuum state is given by the direct product |0iA ⊗ |0i ˜A ˙= |0i.
Using (40), it follows that

In order to ﬁnd the thermal propagator associated with the statistical functions, we must

calculate the commutator

[Ai(t′), ¯Aj(t′′)]µν = ∆µν

ij (t′ − t′′)

where µ, ν = 1,2 and i, j = x, y, z. The anti-diagonal components of the above quantity are

identically zero when we calculate their expectation value in the |0i state. The component

µ = ν = 1 can be written as

IV. Energy Exchange

In order to draw a conclusion we must compare the expressions for the statistical functions

derived in sections II and III. It is clear that only the dissipative part of the susceptibilities,

expression (28) and (67), are diﬀerent. We must remenber that g(τ ), which is the starting

point in the construction of statistical functions, is deﬁned in terms of free ﬁeld eigenstates,

leading to expression (29), which does not depend on the average number of photons. It can

be show[9] that such a diﬀerence does not aﬀect calculations related to phenomena like the

Lamb shift and the AC Stark eﬀect. Hence, the discrepancy acquires an important physical

meaning if, for example, we are interested in the energy exchange between S and R. To see

this, we analyze the variation rate of the mean atomic energy when, initialy, the system is in

In (69), Γa→b represents the transition rate between the levels a and b due to the interaction

with the reservoir. It is shown in reference [3] that (69) can be written in terms of the statistical

and z, we decompose ˙Qfr in

the rate of spontaneous emission relative to transition between the levels a and b.

Just as a random classical perturbation, the ﬂuctuations of the radiation ﬁeld transfer

populations from level a to a higher or lower level b. From (74), we see that the incident

radiation contributes to processes with a factor proportional to hn(|ωab|)i per mode and, from

(75), we see that the vacuum ﬂuctuations contribute proportionaly to 1/2.

The quantity ˙Qrr is calculated in the same way, from (29), (30) e (72). As a result, we ﬁnd

Expression (83) shows that, in thermal equilibrium, the stability of the atomic system is

preserved, as we should expect. Note that, for T = 0, this stability is still holds, since the

eﬀects of radiation reaction,

V. Concluding Remarks

We have discussed the issue of temperature implementation in DDC and argued that if we

naively apply the equipartition theorem, essential information may be lost. This occurs be-

cause we have neglected essential physical requirements. On the other hand, in the TFD

approach the temperature is introduced at an early stage, in the eigenstates of the number

operator for the radiation ﬁeld, through the modiﬁcation of the vacuum state[6]. In fact, the

eigenstates of the number operator do not satisfy the same dynamics of the original (free)

ﬁeld and, in this case, the Fock space of asymptotic states of the electromagnetic ﬁeld must

be constructed taking into account the correlations between the reservoir R and an image
reservoir ˜R, simmulating the eﬀects of thermal correlations[10]. In quantum electrodynamics

we have an analogue situation, where a consistent construction of particle eigenstates must

take into account the long range Coulomb interaction, which modiﬁes the dynamics of these

particle states in the asymptotic region[11].

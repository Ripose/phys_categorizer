We present a lifetime measurements of the 6s level of rubidium. We use a time-correlated single-
photon counting technique on two diﬀerent samples of rubidium atoms. A vapor cell with variable
rubidium density and a sample of atoms conﬁned and cooled in a magneto-optical trap. The 5P1/2
level serves as the resonant intermediate step for the two step excitation to the 6s level. We detect
the decay of the 6s level through the cascade ﬂuorescence of the 5P3/2 level at 780 nm. The two
samples have diﬀerent systematic eﬀects, but we obtain consistent results that averaged give a
lifetime of 45.57 ± 0.17 ns.

INTRODUCTION

This paper presents our measurements of the lifetime
of the 6s level in rubidium using time-correlated single-
photon counting techniques in two diﬀerent atomic envi-
ronments: An atomic vapor cell, and a magneto-optical
trap (MOT). This work complements and enhances our
program of francium spectroscopy and weak interaction
physics.[1] We have previously measured lifetimes in fran-
cium and rubidium only in a MOT.[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] We
use the same apparatus except for the source of atoms so
we carefully address the diﬀerent systematic eﬀects that
are unique to each one of them. The present measure-
ments are necessary to understand systematic eﬀects on
the measurement of the equivalent level in francium, the
8s level.[7]

Measurements of excited state atomic lifetimes in the
low-lying states of the s manifold enhance our under-
standing of the wave functions and the importance of cor-
relation corrections in the theoretical calculations. Rela-
tivistic corrections in rubidium are smaller than in other
heavier alkali such as cesium or francium. This particular
level (6s) is of primary importance to the optical PNC
measurements that look for the parity forbidden dipole
transition between the ground state and the ﬁrst excited
state with the same orbital angular momentum.[8, 9].
The comparison of measurements with theoretical pre-
dictions test the quality of the computed wave functions.
The calculation of the wave functions have now reached
new levels of sophistication [10, 11] based on Many Body
Perturbation Theory (MBPT). Those calculations are
particularly important in the interpretation of precision
tests of discrete symmetries in atoms such as Parity Non-
Conservation (PNC) [8] and Time Reversal (TR).[12]

The paper is structured as follows: We show the rela-
tionship between lifetimes and atomic structure in sec-
tion II. Sec. III presents the experimental method for
the lifetime measurement with details on the two sources
of atoms. Sec.
IV has the data analysis for the life-
time measurement. Sec. V summarizes the results and

compares them with previous results and theoretical pre-
dictions. Sec. VI contains the conclusions in the context
of similar measurements in rubidium and francium.

II. LIFETIMES AND ATOMIC STRUCTURE

The lifetime of an exited atomic state depends on the
initial and ﬁnal state wave functions and the interaction
that connects them. Since the electromagnetic interac-
tion in atomic physics is well understood, radiative life-
times give information on atomic structure.

The lifetime τ of an excited state is determined by its

individual decay rates, 1/τi, to other states by

where ω is the transition energy divided by ¯h, c is the

J are respectively, the initial and ﬁnal state angular
momenta, τi
is the excited state partial lifetime, and
|hJkrkJ ′i| is the reduced matrix element.

A calculation of the reduced matrix element requires
the precise knowledge of the electronic wave functions in-
volved. The presence of the radial operator makes the
matrix element more sensitive to contributions of the
wave functions at large distances from the nucleus.

III. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

We use time-correlated single-photon counting [13] to
obtain the lifetime of the 6s level in rubidium in a vapor
cell and in a MOT. This two step transition method is
well established both for vapor cells [14] and MOTs [5, 6]
in alkalis.

Figure 1 shows the energy levels of 85Rb (I = 5/2)
relevant to the lifetime measurement. We excite the 6s
level in a two-photon resonant process. The ﬁrst step
laser at 795 nm populates the 5P1/2 F = 3 level and the
second step laser at 1324 nm excites the 5P1/2 → 6S1/2
transition.

After we turn oﬀ the excitation lasers, the atom re-
turns back to the ground level using two diﬀerent decay
channels. First, by emitting a 1324 nm photon it decays
back to the 5P1/2 state and ﬂuoresces 795 nm light to
return to the 5s ground level. This decay path is not
used for the 6s level lifetime measurement. The second
possible decay channel is the 6s → 5P3/2 transition fol-
lowed by the decay to the 5s ground level. The 1367
nm ﬂuorescence from the ﬁrst step of this decay is unob-
served, but we detect 780 nm light from the second part
of the decay. Since the lifetime of the 5P3/2 state is well
known,[2, 15, 16, 17] it is possible to extract the 6s level
lifetime indirectly from the ﬂuorescence distribution of
the second step of the cascading decay.

We use a high eﬃciency MOT to capture a sample of
rubidium atoms at a temperature lower than 300 µK.
The MOT is in line with the Stony Brook Superconduct-
ing LINAC and is optimized to trap francium.[18] We
load the MOT from a rubidium vapor produced by a dis-
penser in a glass cell coated with a dry ﬁlm to reduce

sticking to the walls. The MOT consists of three pairs of
retro-reﬂected beams, each with 15 mW/cm2 intensity,
3 cm diameter (1/e intensity) and red detuned 19 MHz
from the atomic resonance. A pair of coils generates a
magnetic ﬁeld gradient of 9 G/cm. The trap contains 104
atoms with a diameter of 0.5 mm and a typical lifetime
between 5 and 10 s.

We perform the lifetime measurement also in a vapor
cell. The cell is under vacuum (approximately 10−5 Pa)
and a dispenser provides the rubidium for the measure-
ment. The cell is uncoated and we use no buﬀer gas. We
keep the rubidium density low to avoid collisional quench-
ing and radiation trapping eﬀects. The typical mean free
path of the atoms in the cell is more than 30 m. We can
apply a uniform magnetic ﬁeld to the cell in contrast to
the permanent magnetic ﬁeld gradient in the MOT.

A. Lasers System

Figure 2 shows the experimental setup. We use a Co-
herent 899-21 titanium-sapphire (Ti:sapph) laser at 780
nm between the 5s F = 3 and the 5P3/2 F = 4 levels
to trap and cool the atoms. A Coherent 899-21 Ti:sapph
laser at 795 nm between the 5s F = 2 and the 5P1/2
F = 3 repumps any atom that falls out of the cycling
transition. The trap and repumper beams are not nec-
essary for the vapor cell measurement. We excite the
atoms to the 6s level via a two step transition. A Co-
herent 899-01 (or a Coherent 899:21 for the vapor cell)
at 795 nm between the 5s F = 3 and the 5P1/2 F = 3
levels makes the ﬁrst step to the 5P1/2 level and a EOSI
2010 diode laser at 1.324 µm completes the transition to
the 6s level.

A Burleigh WA-1500 wavemeter monitors the wave-
length of all the lasers to about ±0.001 cm−1. We lock
the trap, repumper and ﬁrst step laser with a transfer
lock.[19] We use a diﬀerent method to lock the second
step laser on the vapor cell and on the MOT measure-

ments as described below. Figure 3 shows both locking
methods for the second step laser.

Second step laser lock for the MOT. We transfer
the stability of the Helium-Neon laser (Melles-Griot He-
Ne 05-STP-901) used on the lock of the other lasers [19]
to lock a Michelson interferometer with a 200 MHz free
spectral range. The 1324 nm light propagates collinearly
with the He-Ne light inside the interferometer. We detect
the output of the locked interferometer at 1324 nm and
use that signal to lock the second step laser to a side
of the fringe, which allows us to set it on the atomic
resonance by an oﬀset adjustment. We achieve a drift
smaller than 5 MHz per hour.

Second step laser lock for the vapor cell. We use
two photon modulation transfer spectroscopy to lock the
second step laser. We split the ﬁrst step laser at 795 nm
into two beams and send both of them through a sepa-
rate rubidium glass cell. The room temperature vapor
cell is uncoated and the beam propagates approximately
7 cm inside the cell, which leads to a typical absorption
of about 15 %. We collinearly apply the 1.324 µm second
step laser to one of the beams to excite the second tran-
sition. If the laser is resonant to the two step transition
it results in less absorption of the 795 nm light. Two
beams and balanced detection allow common mode noise
rejection to increase the signal to noise ratio. We use the
internal piezoelectric crystal of the 1.324 µm diode laser
to dither its frequency at 1.3 kHz and perform lock-in
detection of the 795 nm light transmission through the
cell. We feedback the resulting error signal to the second
step laser to lock it with comparable performance to that
of the Michelson lock.

We send and retro-reﬂect 1.5 mW of the ﬁrst step laser
power to the trap region. We focus it to an spot size
approximately equal to the trap size. The second step
laser travels at an small angle with respect to the ﬁrst
step laser and we also focus it to match the trap size
with a power of 1 mW. For the vapor cell measurement
the excitation beams propagate collinearly inside of the
glass cell. We send 100 µW of power at 795 nm and 0.4
mW of power at 1.324 µm and focus it to a spot size of
about 0.6 mm.

B. Timing

Figure 4 displays the timing sequence for the excitation
and decay cycle. We apply the two step excitation 500 ns
after the trap laser turnoﬀ for a duration of 100 ns. We
turn oﬀ the repumper at the same time as the two step
lasers to look for the ﬂuorescence decay of the atoms. The
counting electronics are sensitive for 500 ns to record the
excitation and decay signal. The cycle repetition rate is
100 kHz. The trap and repumper pulses are not necessary
for the vapor cell measurement.

Modulation for the MOT. We turn the trap laser on
and oﬀ with an electro optic modulator (EOM) (Gs¨anger
LM0202) and an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) (Crys-

tal Technology 3200-144) as shown in Fig. 2. The EOM
gives a fast turnoﬀ and the AOM improves the long term
on/oﬀ ratio. The combination of the two gives an extinc-
tion ratio of better than 1600:1 after 500 ns. We mod-
ulate the repumper and ﬁrst step laser with an AOM
(Crystal Technology 3200-144) with an on/oﬀ ratio of
109:1 and 26:1 respectively after 30 ns. We couple the
1324 nm light into a single mode optical ﬁber. We use a
combination of a 10 Gbits/s lithium niobate electro-optic
ﬁber modulator (Lucent Technologies 2623N) followed by
an ﬁber ampliﬁer (InPhenix IPSAD1301) and a second
identical ﬁber modulator to turn the laser on and oﬀ.
The combination of the three elements gives an on/oﬀ

ratio better than 1000:1 after 20 ns.

Modulation for the vapor cell. For the vapor cell
measurement we do not need the trap and repumper
beams and we install the EOM on the ﬁrst step laser
path instead. In this case we achieve an extinction ratio
of better than 100:1 in 30 ns. We reduce any radio fre-
quency (RF) emission generated by the fast turnoﬀ of the
EOM placing it in a separate room inside a metal cage.
We use only the last ﬁber modulator for the 1324 nm
laser and we achieve an on/oﬀ ratio of 110:1 after 20 ns.
Figure 2 shows an schematic diagram of the modulation
of all the lasers.

C.

Imaging system

A 1:1 imaging system (f/3.9) collects the MOT ﬂuo-
rescence photons onto a charge coupled device (CCD)
camera (Roper Scientiﬁc, MicroMax 1300YHS-DIF). We
monitor the trap with the use of an interference ﬁlter at
780 nm in front of the camera. A beam-splitter in the
imaging system sends 50 % of the light onto a photomul-
tiplier tube (PMT) (Hamamatsu R636). An interference
ﬁlter at 780 nm in front of the PMT reduces the back-
ground light other than ﬂuorescence from the cascade
through the 5P3/2 level decay back to the ground state
5S1/2.

The 1:1 (f/2.4) imaging system for the vapor cell is
perpendicular to the excitation beams and collects the
ﬂuorescence from the decaying atoms to a PMT (Hama-
matsu R636) with a 780 nm interference ﬁlter in front of
it.

D. Detection electronics

Figure 5 shows the electronic processing of the detected
ﬂuorescence. When the PMT detects a photon, it gen-
erates a variable amplitude electronic pulse. We ﬁrst
amplify the signal with an Ortec AN106/N ampliﬁer, we
send it to a linear gate (EG&G LG101/N, not used for
the vapor cell measurement) and then to an Ortec 934
constant fraction discriminator (CFD). The output of the
CFD goes to a gated time-to-amplitude converter (TAC)
(Ortec 467). The gating is done directly on the TAC for
the MOT measurement and with an external gate (Ortec
LG101/N) for the vapor cell measurement. The photon
pulse starts the TAC and we stop it with an electronically
generated pulse that has a ﬁxed time delay with respect
to the excitation laser pulse. Starting the TAC with a ﬂu-
orescence photon eliminates the accumulation of counts
from cycles with no detected photons. We use a multi-
channel analyzer (MCA) (EG&G Trump-8k) to produce
a histogram of the events showing directly the exponen-
tial decay. A Berkeley Nucleonics Corporation BNC 8010
pulse generator is the master clock with slaved pulse and
signal generators to provide the timing sequence for the
measurement.

IV. DATA ANALYSIS

We extract the atomic radiative lifetime from the mea-
sured ﬂuorescence decay. We take sets of data for about
600 s, that are individually processed, added together,
and ﬁtted. The 6s level decays through the 5p states to
the 5s level as shown in Fig. 1 and we detect the indirect
decay through the 5P3/2 state. The ﬁtting function is a
sum of two exponentials, a background and an sloping
background coming from the trap laser turnoﬀ

where τ5p is the known lifetime of the 5P3/2 state and τ6s
the lifetime we want to extract, A6s and A5p are the coef-
ﬁcients of the exponentials while AB and AS characterize
the background. AS = 0 for the vapor cell measurement
since there is no trap laser. Equation 4 reduces to a sin-
gle exponential if one waits long enough after the turnoﬀ
to take data.[20] We instead maximize the statistics by
including both exponentials in our analysis.

The ﬁrst part in the data analysis requires a pile-up
correction, that accounts for the preferential counting of
early events.[13] If Ni is the number of counts in the
MCA channel i, and NE is the total number of excita-
tion cycles, then N ′
i is the corrected number of counts in
channel i given by

As low count rates keep this correction small, we collect
data with a small number of ﬂuorescence photons. We
typically count one photon every 100 cycles, which cor-
responds to a correction in the ﬁtted lifetime by 0.1 %.

its results. Figure 6 shows an example of the ﬁtting pro-
cedure. We start the ﬁt 20 ns (25 ns for the vapor cell
measurement) after both excitation lasers are oﬀ. The
ﬁtting function describes the data well, and the reduced
χ2
ν of this particular decay is 0.98. The average χ2
ν for the
MOT data is 1.05 ± 0.06 and for the vapor cell 1.09 ±
0.08. A discrete Fourier transform of the residuals shows
no structure.

The MOT and vapor cell measurements have some
characteristics that are intrinsically diﬀerent between
them. The MOT cools the atoms to a very low tempera-
ture, while the atoms in the vapor cell have temperatures
corresponding to Doppler shifts signiﬁcantly larger than
the natural linewidth of the transitions of interest. The
MOT has magnetic ﬁeld gradient always present which
can be removed for the vapor cell. These diﬀerences gen-
erate systematic eﬀects that are intrinsic to each system.
We classify the systematic eﬀects into two groups, com-
mon eﬀects to both the MOT and the vapor cell mea-
surement and distinct eﬀects that appear in a diﬀerent
way in both systems.

5

A. Common systematic eﬀects

1. Truncation uncertainty

The truncation uncertainty takes into account the vari-
ation of the ﬁtted lifetime depending on the start and
end points of the ﬁt. We ﬁnd no statistically signiﬁcant
change in the obtained lifetime when we change both the
initial or ﬁnal point of the ﬁt.

2. Time calibration

We calibrate the scale on the MCA by sending a se-
ries of artiﬁcial start and stop pulses with known delay
directly to the TAC either from one of the DG535 pulse
generators or from two DG535 pulse generators triggered
by a frequency synthesizer (Rockland 5600). The linear
ﬁt to the resulting data contributes a ± 0.01 % to the life-
time uncertainty and it is consistent using either source
of calibration pulses.

3. TAC and MCA response nonuniformity

A nonuniformity in the TAC or MCA results in diﬀer-
ent bins of the MCA having diﬀerent response sensitiv-
ities that alters the obtained lifetime. We measure the
height uniformity of the TAC/MCA system by trigger-
ing the PMT with random photons from a white light
source. The nonuniformity of the TAC/MCA contribute
a 0.11 % (0.02 % for the vapor cell measurement) to
the uncertainty of the lifetime. The need for additional
electronic gates in the MOT measurement increases the
nonuniformity in the electronics response. The response
changes slightly between days. It shows up in the data
as an additional noise contribution that is responsible for
the deviation of the χ2
ν from one. The eﬀect is already
included in this uncertainty contribution.

4.

Imperfect laser turnoﬀ

An imperfect turnoﬀ of the excitation lasers inﬂuences
the observed decay signal. If the second step laser is not
completely turned oﬀ during the decay, atoms that decay
to the 5P1/2 state can be reexcited to the 6s level. We
test the turnoﬀ by comparing the lifetime obtained when
we leave the ﬁrst step laser continuously on or oﬀ during
the decay. We establish a limit of 0.07 % for the eﬀect
of the imperfect turnoﬀ of the second step laser in the
MOT measurement.

We use two modulators for the second step laser on the
MOT measurement to achieve a large on/oﬀ ratio. The
vapor cell measurement uses only one modulator and we
apply a correction to the obtained lifetime.

The appendix presents the model used to calculate the
eﬀect of an imperfect turnoﬀ on the lifetime. We solve

the rate equations and compare the result obtained with
a perfect turnoﬀ to the experimental one. We ﬁnd a cor-
rection to the lifetime of - 0.11 ns and a sensitivity anal-
ysis of the parameters of the model gives an uncertainty
contribution of ± 0.1 %.

5.

Initial state conditions

The lifetime should be independent of the populations
of the diﬀerent levels at the beginning of the decay. We
can change the initial state conditions by changing the
power of the ﬁrst or second step laser pulses, or their
duration. We calculate the linear correlation coeﬃcient
and its integral probability to study the correlation be-
tween the obtained lifetime and the external variable.
The larger the integral probability is, the less likely it is
that a correlation exists [21].

We vary the power of the ﬁrst and second step lasers
by more than an order of magnitude. In the vapor cell
measurement we also changed the excitation pulse dura-
tion between 50 ns and 200 ns. In all the above cases we
found results consistent with no correlation.

B. Distinct systematic eﬀects

1. Radiation trapping

The ﬂuorescence photons from atoms decaying from
the 5P3/2 state to the 5s ground level can excite other
atoms that are in the ground state and take them to
the 5P3/2 level, the so called radiation trapping.[22, 23]
Traps are very convenient systems to make measurements
because the atoms are collected into an small region of
space. The eﬀect of radiation trapping is small in a low
density trap because the distance d corresponds to the
diameter of the trap which is rather small. Vapor cells
on the other hand may have a large density, but Doppler
shifts reduce the eﬀective number of atoms that could
reabsorb the ﬂuorescence.

The probability of a photon being absorbed by an atom

can be deduced from Beer’s law

I(d) = I0 exp(−αd),

(5)

where I0 is the initial intensity and I(d) is the intensity
after traversing the distance d and α = σn represents the
absorption coeﬃcient, with n the density of the atomic
vapor and σ = 3λ2f /2π the absorption cross section.
f = 0.69 is the oscillator strength of the corresponding
transition. For small absorption the probability P of a
photon being absorbed by the atoms is P = σn d.

of radiation trapping after the lasers turnoﬀ is given to

In this approximation the change in the

lifetime of the 5P3/2 level is directly proportional to P .
As our ﬁtting process assumes a ﬁxed 5P3/2 state lifetime,
the change due to radiation trapping propagates linearly
to the measured 6s level lifetime.

We vary the density of rubidium atoms to look for vari-
ations in the lifetime. We change the density by chang-
ing the number of atoms in the MOT or by compressing
the trap with an increase the magnetic ﬁeld gradient.
We establish a limit of 0.01 % for the eﬀect of radiation
trapping on the lifetime.

A rubidium dispenser (SAES) provides the atoms in
the vapor cell measurement. A zirconium alloy matrix
releases rubidium atoms when it is heated by a DC cur-
rent. The desorption follows an Arrhenius process that
requires a certain activation energy Ea. The atomic den-
sity in the cell follows the relation

where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the tempera-

ﬁrm this relationship.

We compare the lifetime obtained at diﬀerent dispenser
temperatures and extrapolate the observed dependency
to zero temperature to obtain the correction to the life-
time. The ﬁtting function for the temperature depen-
dence of the observed lifetime is

τ (T ) = τ0 + A exp(T /B),

(8)

where A, B and the corrected lifetime τ0 are ﬁtting con-
stants. Figure 7 shows the measured data and the ob-
tained ﬁt. The correction of the 6s level lifetime due to
radiation trapping amounts −0.28 ns and generates an
uncertainty contribution of 0.38 % becoming the domi-
nant uncertainty contribution in the vapor cell measure-
ment.

2. Magnetic ﬁeld

The presence of a magnetic ﬁeld can inﬂuence the mea-
sured lifetime through quantum beats between Zeeman
sublevels.
In ideal conditions the atoms in a MOT sit
at the zero of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient but in reality
an imbalance of the power of the retro-reﬂected beams
may displace the trap from this ideal position. The use
of a cascade decay reduces the appearance of quantum
beats.[14, 24]

We quantify the magnetic sensitivity of the lifetime
measurement in two ways. First we perform the mea-
surement at diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld gradients. We do not
observe a correlation with the magnetic ﬁeld gradient and
we establish a limit on the eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld on
the lifetime of 0.17 %. This limit is consistent with mea-
surements done in the vapor cell. Alternatively we keep
the magnetic ﬁeld environment ﬁxed and we displace the
trap by creating an imbalance on the laser beams that
interact with it. We can imbalance the trap beams by
inserting a piece of glass in front of one of the retro-
reﬂection mirrors, and repeating the same for all three
axis. Changing the power of the ﬁrst step laser beam
also displaces the trap. The change in the obtained life-
time in all cases is consistent with statistical ﬂuctuations.

The measurement in the vapor cell does not require
a magnetic ﬁeld gradient. We generate an homoge-
neous magnetic ﬁeld with two coils arranged close to a
Helmholtz conﬁguration with its axes in the same direc-
tion as the excitation laser beams. The magnetic ﬁeld
homogeneity in the excitation region is ± 0.35 %.

Figure 8 shows the measured 6s level lifetime in the
vapor cell as a function of the external uniform mag-
netic ﬁeld. We can control the magnetic ﬁeld to ±0.2
Gauss due to the earth magnetic ﬁeld and other mag-
netic sources. The correlation coeﬃcient for the three
data points is consistent with no correlation. The dotted
line shows the 68% conﬁdence band (1σ) on the linear
ﬁt for a t distribution with one degree of freedom. The
dashed line gives the error on the average assuming no
linear dependence. The ﬁgure shows that both regions
are consistent with each other. We limit the contribu-
tion to the uncertainty due to magnetic ﬁelds to ± 0.07
% using the linear ﬁt to the data.

3. Collisional quenching

Inelastic collisions can modify the lifetime of an excited
state. The velocity of atoms in the MOT (vapor cell) is
smaller than 0.1 m/s (250 m/s). The mean free path of
the atoms in the MOT (vapor cell) is about 104 m (10
m) the eﬀect of collisions is negligible for both samples.

the data (dotted line) and the error on the average assuming
no linear dependence (dashed line).

4. Time of ﬂight

A moving atom can escape the imaging area before
it decays. The eﬀect is more evident in the vapor cell
where the atoms have larger speeds. The MOT (vapor
cell) imaging area has a 1 mm (5.5 mm) diameter aper-
ture. It takes an atom on average 105 (200) lifetimes to
leave the MOT (vapor cell) imaging area. A Monte-Carlo
simulation shows no statistically signiﬁcant change in the
lifetime for the vapor cell measurement.

5. Background slope

The detected light at 780 nm comes from the cascade
decay from the 6s level, but also from scattered light from
the trap laser. We turn oﬀ the trap laser 500 ns before the
two step excitation, but the remanent of the trap laser
light appear in the signal as an slope in the background.
Fits to ﬁles with and without decaying atoms give con-
sistent values for the background slope. We compare the
lifetime obtained when we leave the background slope as
a free parameter or when we ﬁx it to the value obtained
without two step excitation and obtain an uncertainty
contribution of ± 0.22 %. This contribution does not ap-
pear in the vapor cell measurement since there is no trap
laser.

6. PMT response

We look for saturation eﬀects in the PMT due to the
trap light by comparing the PMT response to that of a
fast photodiode which is not subject to saturation. We
replaced the two step excitation by a light pulse at 780
nm. Comparison of the detected pulse in the PMT and
in the fast photodiode gives a maximum contribution to
the uncertainty of ± 0.21 %. This eﬀect is not present in

the vapor cell measurement.

V. RESULTS AND COMPARISON WITH
THEORY

The lifetime of the 6s level depends on the value of the
lifetime of the 5P3/2 state. The uncertainty of the 5P3/2
state lifetime propagates to the uncertainty of the 6s level
lifetime. Using Bayesian statistics the contribution to the
uncertainty (σB6s ) due to the 5P3/2 level is given by[5]

The 5P3/2 level lifetime has been measured previously
by several groups (see Table I). We take the weighted
average of all the measurements. We add the systemat-
ical contributions of the respective errors in quadrature
and calculate the total statistical contribution according

26.23(9) ns gives a Bayesian error for the 6s level lifetime
of 0.17 % (0.11 % for the vapor cell).

Tables II and III contain the error budget and the cor-
rections for the 6s level lifetime measurement in the va-
por cell and in the MOT. The error is dominated by the
statistical uncertainty in the MOT and by radiation trap-
ping in the vapor cell. The vapor cell corrections change
the result by -0.9 %. We obtain a lifetime of 45.64 ±
0.22 ns in the vapor cell and 45.48 ± 0.25 ns in the MOT
for the 6s level lifetime. Both results are consistent with
each other and the average gives 45.57 ± 0.17 ns.

achieved in the systematic eﬀects present in this tech-
nique. The MOT source advantages as far as density,
temperature, and radiation trapping compared to a room
temperature cell; however the intrinsic magnetic gradi-
ent has been a source of concern. This work sets a lower
limit on their inﬂuence by doing the measurement with
the two atomic sources. Statistics limit the MOT results,
while the radiation trapping is the limiting factor in the
glass cell. This measurement improves previous determi-
nations by a factor of thirty.

Our measurement of the lifetime of the ﬁrst excited
state in the s manifold of rubidium has reached a pre-
cision of 0.3 % which permits a very careful tests of the
calculated matrix elements that contribute to the lifetime
of the 6s state. These ab initio MBPT calculations repre-
sent the state of the art in atomic structure calculations
and require a very thorough understanding of the elec-
tron correlations and many other subtle eﬀects that add
and subtract in the expansions. The same techniques ap-
plied for rubidium are used in cesium and the agreement
between experiment and theory enhances the conﬁdence
in the established calculation techniques to provide the
necessary information such as matrix elements for the
extraction of weak interaction parameters from the PNC
measurements in cesium and in future measurement in
other alkali atoms.

VII. APPENDIX

We calculate the eﬀect of the imperfect laser turnoﬀ by
including it in the rate equations as a small perturbation
and compare the result to the unperturbed solution. For
simplicity we rename the 6s, 5P3/2, 5P1/2 and 5s levels
as 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. The rate equations with
the two step excitation on are

˙N1 = −

+ e1N3

τ1

where a is the on/oﬀ ratio.

We use the analytic solution of Eq. 11 for N2(t) to
generate a decay sample that we process in the same
way as real data to obtain a lifetime for the 6s level.

We include the following parameters in the model: For
the lifetimes of the 5p levels we use the results [2, 15, 16,
17] (as in Table I) and for the branching ratios Bi we use
the theoretical values calculated by Safronova et al.[26]
We take e3 = 1/τ3 and to obtain e1 we compare the
observed number of counts when the excitation reaches
steady state to N2(0) in the model.

The most likely parameter conﬁguration consistent
with our experimental setup gives a lifetime correction of
-0.11 ns. We perform a sensitivity analysis for the model
parameters to obtain an uncertainty in the lifetime of ±
0.1 %.

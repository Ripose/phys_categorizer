We have investigated cold ionizing heteronuclear collisions in dilute mixtures of metastable
(2 3S1) 3He and 4He atoms, extending our previous work on the analogous homonuclear collisions
[R. J. W. Stas et al., PRA 73, 032713 (2006)]. A simple theoretical model of such collisions enables
us to calculate the heteronuclear ionization rate coeﬃcient, for our quasi-unpolarized gas, in the
−10 cm3/s. This calculation is supported by
absence of resonant light (T = 1.2 mK): K (th)

INTRODUCTION

The importance of cold collisions with regard to the
dynamics of dilute neutral atom clouds was realized soon
after the advent of laser-cooled and trapped atomic sam-
ples [1]. Since then, numerous investigations, both ex-
perimental and theoretical, have been made into the col-
lisional properties of many diﬀerent homonuclear [2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] and (later) heteronuclear
[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] systems. Collisional studies are
in themselves interesting, leading to an in-depth under-
standing of the various scattering mechanisms present at
such low kinetic energies and methods by which we can
have some measure of control over elastic and inelastic
collisions.

As opposed to collisions between thermal atoms, col-
lisions between cold atoms are sensitive to the long-
range part of the interatomic interaction potential. The
de Broglie wavelength may become comparable to the
characteristic range of the interatomic potential, and (in
the presence of a light ﬁeld) the possibility of exciting a
quasi-molecular state, and the subsequent decay of that
state during a collision, becomes important. These eﬀects
lead to phenomena such as scattering resonances, inter-
action retardation, optically assisted collisions, photoas-
sociation, optical shielding and the formation of ground-
state molecules.

Optically assisted collisions lead to large losses in
magneto-optical traps (MOTs) and are clearly dependant
upon experimental parameters such as the intensity and
detuning of the light frequencies present. A full theoret-
ical treatment of these collisions is often hampered by
the complexity of the molecular hyperﬁne structure [1],
thus MOTs are usually empirically optimized for their in-
tended application, and comparisons with theory or other
experiments are diﬃcult. Collisions in the absence of a
resonant light ﬁeld are, on the other hand, a theoretically
more tractable problem and their associated loss rate co-
eﬃcients are fundamental properties of a given system,
allowing direct comparisons with theory and between ex-
periments. Homonuclear and heteronuclear collisions, ”in

the dark”, between isotopes of a single element are both
mediated at long-range by the van-der-Waals interaction
(∝ 1/R6) and any diﬀerences are due, in the main, to
diﬀering atomic structures and quantum statistical sym-
metries.

Due to the high internal energy (19.8 eV) of metastable
(2 3S1) helium atoms (He*), the spherical symmetry of
this atomic state, and the inverted (hyper)ﬁne structure
of the atoms; ionizing collisions (Penning (PI) and asso-
ciative (AI)):

dominate losses in trapped samples of laser-cooled He*.
This has provided a unique setting for the study of cold
ionizing collisions in which the highly eﬃcient, direct de-
tection of collisional loss products using charged-particle

have made use of microchannel plate (MCP) detectors to
measure ion production rates and investigate collisional
losses in 3He* [20] and 4He* [20, 21, 22, 23]. Having re-
alized the ability to trap large numbers (>108) of both
isotopes (either individually or simultaneously) [19], we
have previously reported on the isotopic diﬀerences be-
tween binary homonuclear collisions of 3He and 4He [13]
in the absence of resonant light, resolving inconsistencies
in prior experimental and theoretical results.

In this article we describe what we believe to be the
ﬁrst study of heteronuclear binary collisions between
metastable atoms. Adapting our transparent theoretical
model [13] slightly, we ﬁrst derive a value for K34 (Sec.
II), the heteronuclear ionization rate coeﬃcient in the
absence of a resonant light ﬁeld. This is complemented
by trap loss measurements performed on a two-isotope
magneto-optical trap (TIMOT) of 3He* and 4He* [19],
from which we also extract a value for K34 (Sec. IV). In
Section V we compare both results and brieﬂy comment
upon loss rates in the presence of the trapping light ﬁelds.

II. SINGLE CHANNEL MODEL OF THE
HETERONUCLEAR IONIZING LOSS RATE

The following model has been described in depth else-
where in its successful application to the description of
homonuclear ionizing collisions [13, 24], where it com-
pares well with the more comprehensive close coupling
theories developed by Venturi et al. [25, 26] and Leo et
al. [27]. Here we extend its applicability to include the
description of heteronuclear He* collisions for which no
calculations have previously been made. In the interests
of brevity we only describe the models salient points and
its adaption to the heteronuclear case.

A.

Ionization rate coeﬃcients

At mK temperatures, collisional processes are domi-
nated by only a few partial waves, ℓ, and the ionization
cross section may be written as a sum over the partial
wave contributions:

σ(ion) =

σ(ion)
ℓ

.

(1)

Xℓ
From a semi-classical viewpoint we may further treat the
inelastic scattering as a two-stage process in which (at
low energies) elastic scattering from the interaction po-
tential V (R) occurs at relatively large internuclear dis-
tance (R ≥ 100 a0), whilst ionization occurs only at small
internuclear distance (R ≈ 5 a0) [28]. The assumption
that the processes of elastic scattering and ionization are
uncoupled allows us to factorize the probability of ion-
ization occurring in a collision, and write the ionization
cross section for collisions with total electronic spin S as

Xℓ

(2S+1)σ(ion) =

(2ℓ + 1)(2S+1)P (tun)

(2S+1)P (ion),

ℓ

(2)
where k is the wave vector of the relative motion of the
two atoms, (2S+1)P (tun)
is the probability of the atoms
reaching small internuclear distance (i.e., not elastically
scattering) and (2S+1)P (ion) is the probability of ioniza-
tion occurring at short internuclear distance. In the He*
system the quantum number S is well conserved during
ionization and the application of Wigner’s spin conser-
vation rule [29] tells us that 5P (ion) is very small [30],
while M¨uller et al.
[31] report ionization probabilities
of 0.975 for other spin states; we thus set 5P (ion) = 0
and 1P (ion) = 3P (ion) = 1 in Eq. (2). Having constructed
the 1Σ+
g molecular potentials as described
in [27] (to which we may add rotational barriers as re-
quired) we modify them to simulate the losses due to
ionization (Fig. 1) [32]. By numerically solving the ra-
dial wave equation and ﬁnding the stationary states using
these potentials, we may calculate the incident and trans-
mitted probability currents, Jin and Jtr respectively, the
ratio of which (Jtr/Jin) gives us (2S+1)P (tun)
. The calcu-

constructed as described in [27] (solid), together with the
modiﬁcations made (dashed). Atoms reaching the region of
small R ionize; the corresponding relative particle propagates
freely to R = −∞ in our model, and ionization is accounted
for by the loss of probability ﬂux from the region of the po-
tential well.

lated partial wave ionization cross sections are shown in
Fig. 2.

The ionization rate coeﬃcient K (particle−1 cm3/s)
(determined in experiments) is temperature dependant,
and may be written in terms of the ionization cross sec-
tion σ(ion)(E) [1, 32, 33]:

where P (MB)
(vr) is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,
for a given temperature, of the relative velocities in the

wave ionization rate coeﬃcients (2S+1)Kℓ(T ) associated
with a given molecular state (ignoring the radial contri-
butions: |s1i1, s2, S, F MF , ℓmℓi) [32].

Although the calculated values of (2S+1)σ(ion)

(Fig. 2),
and (2S+1)Kℓ(T ), are very similar for all isotopic combi-
nations, the description of the collisional process in terms

Optical pumping processes in a MOT cause the dis-

fer from the uniform (unpolarized) distribution assumed

sion channel to the ionizing losses depends upon Pm, and
can be accounted for in our theoretical model by using

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

We investigate cold ionizing collisions in a setup (see
Fig. 4) capable of trapping large numbers (>
∼ 108) of both
3He* and 4He* atoms simultaneously in a TIMOT [13].
A collimated and Zeeman slowed He* beam is used to
load our TIMOT which is housed inside a stainless steel,
ultra-high vacuum chamber. The beam is produced by a
liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooled dc discharge source supplied
with an isotopically enriched (≈ 50/50) gaseous mixture
of 3He and 4He held in a helium tight reservoir. During
operation the reservoir is connected such that all helium
not entering the collimation section (the vast majority of
it) is pumped back into the reservoir and recycled, con-
serving our supply of the relatively expensive 3He gas.
Two LN2 cooled molecular sieves, ensuring a pure sup-
ply of helium to the source, are also contained within
this reservoir; the ﬁrst of these is a type 13X molecu-
lar sieve, whilst the second is type 4A (both are sodium
zeolites having pore sizes of 10 ˚A and 4 ˚A respectively).
We then make use of the curved wavefront technique to
collimate our atomic beam in two dimensions [35] before
it enters the Zeeman slower. Due to its lighter mass 3He
atoms emerge from the source with a greater mean veloc-
ity than 4He atoms and in order to achieve a large ﬂux of
both 3He* and 4He* atoms we have increased the capture
velocity of our Zeeman slower [19, 24]. Our ultra-high
vacuum chamber maintains an operational pressure of
7×10−10 mbar (with a partial presure of 6.5×10−10 mbar,
ground state He atoms from the atomic beam are the
major contribution to this) and is based upon the design
of our next-generation BEC chamber [36]. Two coils in
an anti-Helmholtz conﬁguration produce the quadrupole

magnetic ﬁeld (dB/dz = 0.35 T/m) for the TIMOT; these
are placed in water cooled buckets outside the vacuum
and are brought close to the trapping region by placing
them inside reentrant glass windows situated on either
side of the chamber.

Both helium isotopes are collimated, slowed, and con-
ﬁned in the TIMOT using 1083 nm light nearly resonant
with their 2 3S1 → 2 3P 2 optical transitions (see Fig. 5)
(natural linewidth Γ/2π = 1.62 MHz and saturation in-
tensity Isat = 0.166 mW cm−2, for the cycling transition).
As the isotope shift for this transition is ≈ 34 GHz the
bichromatic beams are produced by overlapping the out-
put from two ytterbium-doped ﬁber lasers (IPG Photon-
ics) on a non-polarizing 50/50 beam splitter. One beam
is sent to the collimation section, whilst the second is
coupled into a single mode polarization maintaining ﬁber
to ensure a perfect overlap of the two frequency compo-
nents, before being split into the Zeeman slowing beam
and the trapping beams. Each ﬁber laser is locked to the
respective cooling transition using saturated absorption
spectroscopy in an rf-discharge cell; acousto-optic modu-
lators are then used to generate the slowing and trapping
frequencies which are detuned by -500 MHz and -40 MHz
respectively (see Fig. 5). The slowing beam is focused
on the source and has a 1/e2 intensity width of 2.2 cm

or released from the trap. With an exposed front plate
held at negative high voltage, one MCP mounted above
the trap center attracts all positive ions produced dur-
ing ionizing collisions (Eq. (1)) in the trap. The second
MCP is shielded by a grounded grid, mounted below the
trap center, and detects only He∗ atoms.

The shielded MCP is used to perform time-of-ﬂight
(TOF) measurements from which we determine the tem-
perature of the trapped atoms. An absorpton image,
in combination with the measured temperature, then al-
lows us to determine the density distribution, size, and

unshielded MCP to measure the instantaneous ionization
rate in the trapped sample, which, in combination with
the information obtained from the absorption images, al-
lows us to determine trap loss and ionization rates in
the sample. Our typical TIMOT parameters and mea-
surements have been reported previously [13, 19] and are
given in Table III. The lower temperatures realized in
the present experiments are due to the resolution of a
power imbalance in two of the trapping laser beams.

IV. DETERMINATION OF THE
HETERONUCLEAR LOSS RATE

The time evolution of the total number of atoms
trapped in our TIMOT, N = N3 +N4, may be described
by the following phenomenological equation [2]:

at the position of the trapped cloud, with each frequency
component having a peak intensity of Ipeak = 9 mW cm−2
(Ipeak/Isat ≈ 54), while the trapping beam is split into six
independent Gaussian beams with 1/e2 intensity widths
of 1.8 cm and total peak intensity Ipeak = 57 mW cm−2
(Ipeak/Isat ≈ 335). The outputs of two diode lasers
(linewidths < 500 kHz), each locked using saturated ab-
sorption spectroscopy to the helium 2 3S1 → 2 3P 2 reso-
nance of one of the isotopes, are overlapped on a second
non-polarizing beam-splitter cube and coupled into a sin-
gle mode polarization maintaining ﬁber. This system de-
livers two, weak, linearly polarized probe beams (∆ = 0,
I = 0.05 Isat, with Isat = 0.27 mW cm−2 assuming equal
population of all magnetic sublevels of the 2 3S1 state in
the trap) to the chamber for the absorption imaging of
each component of the trapped cloud. Absorption images
are recorded using an IR-sensitive charge-coupled device
(CCD) camera [37]. Unfortunately the imaging of both
trapped components cannot be carried out in a single ex-
perimental cycle; sequential runs must be made, imaging
ﬁrst one component and then the other.

Trapped clouds are further monitored by two mi-
crochannel plate (MCP) detectors mounted inside the
chamber. Operated at a voltage of -1.5 kV and positioned
11 cm from the center of the trap, the MCP’s are used to
independently monitor the ions and He∗ atoms escaping

where t denotes time, L is the rate at which atoms are
loaded into the TIMOT, α is the linear loss rate coef-

ﬁcient describing collisions between trapped He* atoms
and background gases, β is the loss rate coeﬃcient result-

ing from binary collisions between trapped He* atoms,
and n is the cloud density. Subscripts denote whether a
given parameter pertains to either of the 3He* or 4He*
components of the mixture.

It should be noted at this point that the ”density lim-
ited” regime, often mentioned with regard to the alkali
systems, is not a feature of the metastable noble gas sys-
tems; in the latter the density is not limited by radi-
ation trapping within the cloud, but by ionizing colli-

sional losses. This is born out in Eq. (12) by the time
dependance of the atom density distributions and hence
our inability to make the simplifying constant density
approximation in the following experiments.

Both linear and quadratic losses in Eq. (12) are due
to a number of diﬀerent mechanisms, and may be subdi-
vided into either ionizing or non-ionizing categories. The
ion production rate may then be expressed in a manner
analogous to Eq. (12):

where ǫa, ǫb, ǫc, ǫd and ǫe are the weights of the various
ionization mechanisms (and may include a factor to ac-
count for a less than unity detection eﬃciency), and the
collision rate coeﬃcient K has been introduced. The loss
and collision rate coeﬃcients are related by the equation
β = 2K, and the appearance of K, instead of β in Eq. 13
expresses the fact that during each ionizing collision, one
ion is produced, but two atoms are lost from the trap.

From an analysis of the trap loss mechanisms [13, 24] it
can be seen that to a good approximation ǫa = ǫc = 0,
whilst ǫb = ǫd = ǫe. The current signal measured by the
MCP is proportional to the ionization rate, Eq. (13); and
for gaussian spatial density distributions (centered with
respect to each other), the voltage measured by the os-
cilloscope may then be written as

where n0 is the central density, σ is the mean rms radius
(of a given cloud component), e is the electron charge,
and Reﬀ is an eﬀective resistance.

The experiment is based around the ability of an MCP
detector to measure the ions produced in our metastable
isotopic mixture with very high eﬃciency, and employs a
method ﬁrst used by Bardou et al. [5] to determine the
ionization rate in the absence of light. To measure the
rate in the dark we perform an experiment in which we
load the TIMOT, switch oﬀ the Zeeman slower beam and
all MOT beams using the frequency detuning AOM’s (the
quadrupole ﬁeld remains on) for 100 µs, before switching
the slowing and trapping light back on again. This on/oﬀ
cycle is easily repeated many times while we monitor the
ion signal and average it (see Fig. 6). The switch-oﬀ time
is short compared to the dynamics of the expanding cloud
(we see no variation in the ion signal during the switch oﬀ
period) and we switch the light on long enough (200 ms)
to recapture the cloud and allow it to equilibrate.

Equation (14) describes the ion production rate in the
dark of our TIMOT; a similar equation describes the
ion production rate of a single-isotope MOT, φMOT . By
combining the equations for φT IMOT and φMOT with a

measurement of the ratio r = (φT IMOT − φbgr)/(φMOT −
φbgr) (where the time dependance of the measured sig-
nals has been omitted because of the short duration of
the switch-oﬀ period), we can derive an expression for
K34.
It has been veriﬁed that under our experimental
conditions the MCP signal varies linearly with the ion
production rate, and all cloud densities and radii may be
derived from absorption images, while we have previously
measured K33 and K44 [13]. As the trap parameters, and
therefore the distribution over the magnetic substates
of the atoms, have changed since the experiments de-
scribed in Ref. [13] were performed, we have used the
theory described in Sec. II B to correct the measured val-
ues of K33 and K44 for these eﬀects, yielding: K33 =
1.6(3) × 10−10 cm3/s and K44 = 6.5(2) × 10−11 cm3/s.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Performing the experiments described in the previ-
ous section, we obtain the result: K (exp)
= 2.5(8) ×
10−10 cm3/s, which compares well with the theoretical
prediction, K (th)
34 = 2.4 × 10−10 cm3/s, obtained after

dominant in the homonuclear case. In our TIMOT the
laser beams are, in contrast to most experiments per-
formed on heteronuclear collisions, far-detuned (25 nat-
ural linewidths) from resonance and the atomic excited
state population in the trap is therefore negligible. We
can only excite a molecular state if the correct light fre-
quency is present and the atoms have reached the Condon
point for the transition. As all light frequencies in our
TIMOT are far detuned from any heteronuclear transi-
tion we expect no contribution to the trap loss rate from
optically assisted heteronuclear collisions.

To summarize, we have measured the heteronuclear
loss rate coeﬃcient K (exp)
in the absence of light for a
trapped mixture of 3He* and 4He* atoms at T = 1 mK.
The measured value of K (exp)
compares very well with
the value predicted by our single channel model of ioniz-
ing collisions in the He* system. Recently, both helium
isotopes were magnetically trapped in the multi-partial
wave regime using buﬀer-gas cooling, and a deep mag-
netic trap [38]. The probable observation of Penning
ionization under these conditions has been reported [39],
and it would be interesting to extend our theory into
the multi-partial wave regime and to high magnetic ﬁeld
values. With the production of quantum degenerate mix-
tures of 3He* and 4He* [40], we also have the possibility
of investigating both homonuclear and heteronuclear He*
collisions at ultracold temperatures in greater detail. An
experiment of interest in this area would be the imple-
mentation of an optical dipole trap in which it would
be possible to prepare ultracold samples in well deﬁned
magnetic substates. In particular, it would be possible
to prepare trapped ultracold samples of 3He* (4He*) in
the mF = −3/2 (mJ = −1) states, for which (as in the
magnetically trapped mF = +3/2 (mJ = +1) states used
in the production of ultracold He* gases) Penning ioniza-
tion should be suppressed.

FIG. 6: Averaged ion signals measured during the experi-
ments. The full line is the signal recorded whilst performing
the experiment with a TIMOT, the dashed line is the corre-
sponding curve for a 3He* MOT (the analogous signal for a
4He* MOT can also be obtained), and the dotted line is the
background signal. The ion rate measured is then averaged
over the 60 µs interval indicated by the shaded region in order
to obtain (φTIMOT −φbgr) and (φ3He*/4He* −φbgr).

undertaking the calculation described in Sec. II. For
future comparison with other theoretical models, the
equivalent theoretical loss-rate coeﬃcient for an unpo-
larized gas mixture at a temperature of T = 1 mK is
K (unpol)
= 2.9 × 10−10 cm3/s (see Fig. 3).These numbers

describe the total heteronuclear loss rate in the absence
of light; the only other potential loss process would be
hyperﬁne state changing collisions, however, due to the
inverted nature of the hyperﬁne structure in 3He* the
atoms occupy the lowest hyperﬁne level of the 2 3S1 mul-
tiplet and so cannot relax to a lower level, while the en-
dothermic collision necessary to reach the F = 1/2 state
would require ≈ 200 mK to be provided by the trap,
200 times more than the typical collision energy in the
TIMOT. The error in the experimental value is mainly
determined by errors in the absorption imaging, which
we ﬁnd to be ≈ 30%, and by the error bars reported
on our previous measurements of the homonuclear loss
rates [13].

With regard to optically assisted collisions, we note
that the excited state potentials in the case of heteronu-
clear collisions are governed at long-range by the van-der-
Waals interaction (∝ 1/R6), having a much shorter range
than that of the resonant dipole interaction (∝ 1/R3)

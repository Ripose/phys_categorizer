The QED contribution to the energies of the circular (n, ℓ = n − 1), 2 ≤ n ≤ 19 transitions
have been calculated for several kaonic atoms throughout the periodic table, using the current
world average kaon mass. Calculations were done in the framework of the Klein-Gordon equation,
with ﬁnite nuclear size and all-order Uelhing vacuum polarization corrections, as well as Kall´en
and Sabry and Wichmann and Kroll corrections. These energy level values are compared with
other computed values. The circular transition energies are compared with available measured and
theoretical transition energy. Electron screening is evaluated using a Dirac-Fock model for the
electronic part of the wave function. The eﬀect of electronic wavefunction correlation is evaluated
for the ﬁrst time.

INTRODUCTION

An exotic atom is formed when a particle, with a negative charge and long-enough lifetime, slows down and stops
in matter. It can then displace an atomic electron, and become bound in a high principal quantum number atomic
orbital around the nucleus. The principal quantum number of this highly excited state is of the order of n =
m/me,
where m and me are the masses of the particle and of the electron, respectively [1]. The higher the overlap between
p
the wave functions of the electron and the particle, the more probable is the formation of an exotic atom [1].

The exotic atoms formed in this way are named after the particle forming them. It the particle is a the negative

kaon K −, a meson with a spin-0 and a lifetime of 1.237×10−8 s, a kaonic atom is thus created.

Because the particle mass, and thus transition energies are so much higher that the electron’s (a kaon is ≈964 times
heavier than an electron), the de-excitation of the exotic atom will start via Auger processes, in a process equivalent
to internal conversion for γ-rays, while the level spacing is small and there are electrons to be ejected, and then via
radiative (E1) transitions, producing characteristic X-rays while cascading down its own sequence of atomic levels
until some state of low principal quantum number. One thus can end with a completely striped atom, provided the
mass of the exotic particle is large and the atomic number of the atom not too high.

The initial population of the atomic states is related to the available density of states, so for any given principal
quantum number n the higher orbital momenta are favored to some extent because of their larger multiplicity. As
the Auger transitions do not change the shape of the angular momentum distribution, the particle quickly reaches
the (ℓ = n − 1) orbits [1]. Once the radiative (E1) transitions begin to dominate, we have the selection rule ∆ℓ = ±1,

often with many possible values of ∆n being important. Under such a scheme, the kaons in low angular momentum
orbits will rapidly reach orbitals with a sizable overlap with the nucleus and be captured. Soon mostly the circular
orbitals (n, ℓ = n − 1) from which only transitions to other circular orbits can occur, (n, ℓ = n − 1) →(n − 1, ℓ = n − 2),
will be populated. The so-called parallel transition (n, ℓ = n − 2) →(n − 1, ℓ = n − 3) is much weaker.

Finally the particle in a state of low angular momentum will be absorbed by the nucleus through the kaon-nucleus
strong interaction. This strong interaction causes a shifting of the energy of the lowest atomic level from its purely
electro-magnetic value while the absorption reduces the lifetime of the state and so X-ray transitions to this ﬁnal
atomic level are broadened.

Therefore, following the stopping of the kaon in matter, well-deﬁned states of a kaonic atom are established and
the eﬀects of the kaon-nucleus strong interaction can be studied. The overlap of the atomic orbitals with the nucleus
covers a wide range of nuclear densities thus creating a unique source of information on the density dependence of
the hadronic interaction.

Here we are concerned with levels in which the eﬀect of the strong interaction is negligible, to study the atomic
structure. Our objective is to provide highly accurate values of high-angular momentum circular transition, which
can be useful for experiment in which internal calibration lines, free from strong interaction shifts and broadening are
needed, as has been done in the case of pionic and antiprotonic atoms [2, 3, 4, 5]. Our second objective is to study
the electron screening, i.e., the change in the energy of the kaon due to the presence of a few remaining electrons, in
a relativistic framework.

In general, although the kaonic atom energy is dominated by the Coulomb interaction between the hadron and
the nucleus, one must take into account the strong-interaction between the kaon and the nucleus when the kaon and
nuclear wave function overlap. As our aim is to provide highly accurate QED-only values, that can be used to extract
experimental strong-interaction shifts from energy measurements. We refer the interested reders to the literature,
e.g., Refs. [6, 7, 8].

Exotic X-ray transitions have been intensively studied for decades as they can provide the most precise and relevant
physical information for various ﬁelds of interest. This study is pursued at all major, intermediate energy accelerators
where mesons are produced: at the AGS of Brookhaven National Laboratory (USA), at JINR (Dubna, Russia), at
LAMPF, the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (Los Alamos, USA), at LEAR, the Low Energy Antiproton Ring of
CERN (Geneva, Switzerland), at the Meson Science Laboratory of the University of Tokyo (at KEK, Tsukuba, Japan),
at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland), at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (Chilton, England), at
the Saint-Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute (Gatchina, Russia), and at TRIUMF (Vancouver, Canada) [1].

It is now planed, in the context of the DEAR experiment (strong interaction shift and width in kaonic hydrogen) on
DAΦNE in Frascati [9, 10] to measure some other transitions of kaonic atoms, such as the kaonic nitrogen, aluminum,
titanium, neon, and silver. Similar work is under way at KEK.

The measurements concerning the exotic atoms permit the extraction of precise information about the orbiting
particle [11], such as charge/mass ratio, and magnetic moment, and the interaction of such particles with nuclei. In
addition, properties of nuclei [12], such as nuclear size, nuclear polarization, and neutron halo eﬀects in heavy nuclei
[13], have been studied. Furthermore, the mechanism of atomic capture of such heavy charged particles and atomic
eﬀects such as Stark mixing [14] and trapping [15] have been studied extensively.

Furthermore, as the X-ray transition energies are proportional to the reduced mass of the system, studies in the
intermediate region of the atomic cascade were used to measure the masses of certain negative particles. In order to
minimize the strong interactions for the mass determination it is considered only transitions between circular orbits
(n, n − 1)→(n − 1, n − 2) far from the nucleus [16].

In this paper, we calculate the orbital binding energies of the kaonic atoms for 1 ≤ Z ≤ 92 and 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ 19 for
circular states and 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ 18 for parallel near circular states by the resolution of the Klein-Gordon equation (KGE)
including QED corrections.

The paper is organized as follows. The principle of the calculation is outlined in Sec. II. The results obtained in

this work are given in Sec. III. Finally we give our conclusions in Sec. IV.

II. CALCULATION OF THE ENERGY LEVELS

A. Principle of the calculation

Because of the much larger mass of the particle, its orbits are much closer to the central nucleus than those of the
electrons. In addition, since there is only one heavy particle, the Pauli principle does not play a role and the whole
range of classical atomic orbits are available. As a result, to ﬁrst order, the outer electrons can be ignored and the
exotic atom has many properties similar to those of the simple, one-electron hydrogen atom [17].

In order to access the inﬂuence of the electrons in the kaonic atoms, i.e., the electronic screening eﬀect, we com-
puted the ratio of the diﬀerence between the kaonic binding energies of the atomic systems (K − + e−+nucleus) and
(K −+nucleus), relatively to the kaonic binding energy of the (K −+nucleus) system, in which we have considered an
1s electron. The obtained results are presented in percentage in Table I. Considering that the kaonic binding energy
increases with the quantum numbers n and ℓ and considering that the average of the experimental error bars of all
available transition is about 0.4% of the measured energy value, we may conclude that the majority of the experiments
don’t have enough precision to resolve the eﬀect of the electronic screening, namely in the low ℓ orbitals.

B. Numerical solution of the Klein-Gordon equation

Since kaons are spin-0 bosons, they obey the Klein Gordon equation, which in the absence of strong interaction

may be written, in atomic units, as

α2 (E − Vc(r))2 + ~∇2 − µ2c2
h

i

ψ (r) = 0,

where µ is the kaon reduced mass, E is the Kaon total energy, Vc is the sum of the Coulomb potential, describ-
ing the interaction between the kaon and the ﬁnite charge distribution of the nucleus, of the U¨ehling vacuum-
polarization potential (of order α (αZ)) and of the potential due to the electrons. Units of ~ = c = 1 are used.
For a spherically symmetric potential Vc, the bound state solutions of the KG equation (1) are of the usual form
ψnℓm (r) = Yℓm (θ, φ) (pnℓ (r) /r). Compared to the numerical solution of the Dirac-Fock equation [18], here we must
take care of the fact that the equation is quadratic in energy. The radial diﬀerential equation deduced from (1) is
rewritten as a set of two ﬁrst-order equations

where p = p(r) is the radial KG wave function. Following Ref. [18] the equation is solved by a shooting method, using
a predictor-corrector method for the outward integration up to a point rm which represents the classical turning point
in the potential Vc. The inward integration uses ﬁnite diﬀerences and the tail correction and provide a continuous p
as well as a practical way to ﬁx how far out one must start the integration to solve Eq. (2) within a given accuracy.
The eigenvalue E is found by requesting that q is continuous at rm. If we suppose that q is not continuous, then an
improved energy E is obtained by a variation of p and q, such that

To ﬁnd the corresponding δE we replace p, q and E by p + δp, q + δq and E + δE in Eq. (2). Keeping only ﬁrst order
terms we get

Multiplying Eq. (4) by q and Eq. (5) by p, subtracting the two equations, and using the original diﬀerential equation

or (8) to obtain high-accuracy energy and wave function by an iterative procedure, checking the number of node to
insure convergence toward the right eigenvalue.

C. Nuclear structure

For heavy elements, a change between a point-like and an extended nuclear charge distribution strongly modiﬁes
the wave function near the origin. One nuclear contribution is easily calculated by using a ﬁnite charge distribution
in the diﬀerential equations from which the wave function are deduced. For atomic number larger than 45 we use a
Fermi distribution with a thickness parameter t = 2.3 fm and a uniform spherical distribution otherwise. The most
abundant naturally-occurring isotope was used.

In Table II we list the nuclear parameters used in the presented calculations in atomic units.

D. QED eﬀects

1. Self-consistent Vacuum Polarization

A complete evaluation of radiative corrections in kaonic atoms is beyond the scope of the present work. However the
eﬀects of the vacuum polarization in the U¨ehling approximation, which comes from changes in the bound-kaon wave
function, can be relatively easily implemented in the framework of the resolution of the KGE using a self-consistent
method.

In practice one only need to add the U¨ehling potential to the nuclear Coulomb potential, to get the contribution
of the vacuum polarization to the wave function to all orders, which is equivalent to evaluate the contribution of all
diagrams with one or several vacuum polarization loop of the kind displayed on Fig. 1. For the exact signiﬁcation of
these diagrams see, e.g., [19, 20, 21].

This happens because the used self-consistent method is based on a direct numerical solution of the wave function
diﬀerential equation. Many precautions must be taken however to obtain this result as the vacuum polarization
potential is singular close to the origin, even when using ﬁnite nuclei. The method used here is described in detail in
Ref. [22], and is based on [23].

(1 + mK−/MA). Yet in the relativistic formalism used here, there are other recoil to be considered. The ﬁrst recoil
correction is −B2/2MA, where B is the binding energy of the level. For fermions other corrections are known which
are discussed, e.g. in [24]. For bosons the situation is not so clear. Contributions to the next order correction can
be found in [25]. Their expression depends on the nuclear spin, and are derived only for spin 0 and spin 1/2 nuclei.
For a boson bound to a spin 0 nucleus, this extra correction is non zero except for ℓ = 0 states, and is of the same
order as the −B2/2MA recoil term. For spin 1/2 nuclei it is of order (Zα)4m2
A and thus, being reduced by an
extra factor mK−/MA should be negligible except for light elements. The self-energy for heavy particles is usually
neglected. To our knowledge no complete self-energy correction has been performed for bosons.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In Table III we compare the energy values calculated in this work for selected kaonic atoms with existing theoretical
values. It was assumed a kaon mass of mK− = 493.677±0.013 MeV [26]. All energy values listed are in keV units.
The values obtained by other authors agree with ours to all ﬁgures, even though earlier calculations are much less
accurate.

In Table IV we present the transition energy values, obtained in this work, and by other authors, for the Al(5g → 4f )
and the Pb(12o → 11n) transitionsn, in keV units. Again, we observe a good agreement between all the listed results.
In Table V we list, in keV units, the calculated kaonic atom X-ray energies for transitions between circular levels
(n, ℓ = n − 1) → (n − 1, ℓ = n − 2) in this work. The transitions are identiﬁed by the initial (ni) and ﬁnal (nf )
principal quantum numbers of the pertinent atomic levels. The calculated values of the transition energies in this
work are compared with available measured values (Em), and with other calculated values (Ec).

Comparison between the present theoretical values and the measured values shows that the majority of our transition
energies are inside the experimental error bar. There are however a number of exceptions: 2p → 1s transition in
hydrogen, the 3 → 2 transition in Be, the 4 → 3 transitions in Si and Cl, the 7 → 6 transition in tungsten and
the U(8 → 7).
In several cases the measurement for transitions between the levels immediately above is in good
agreement. These levels are less sensitive to strong interaction, because of a smaller overlap of the kaon wave function
with the nucleus. This thus point to a strong interaction eﬀect. This is certainly true for hydrogen in which the
1s state is involved, and quite clear for Be. In the case of lead, the large number of measured transitions makes it
interesting to look into more details, and investigate the eventual role of electrons.

To assess the inﬂuence of the electrons that survived to the cascade process of the kaon, we calculated transition
energies in two cases for which experimental measurements have small uncertainties, and a long series of measured
transitions, namely the Pb (12o → 11n) and (13q → 12o), without and with electrons.
In Table VI we list, in
units of eV, the transition energy contributions due to the inclusion of 1, 2, 4 and 10 electrons in the kaonic system,
for the mentioned transitions. We conclude that the electron screening eﬀect by 1s electrons is much larger than
experimental uncertainties, while the eﬀect of 2s electrons is of the same order. Other electrons have a negligible
inﬂuence. Moreover, we can conclude that the electronic correlation eﬀects are negligible since the transition energy
contribution of the Be-like system for conﬁguration 1s22s2 diﬀers only by 0.1 eV from the energy obtained with the
1s22s2 + 1s22p2 conﬁgurations, which represents the well-known strong intrashell correlation of Be-like ions.

We investigated the electronic inﬂuence in few more transitions, using the same guideline to choose the more relevant

6

ones, i.e., small experimental uncertainties. We present in Table VII the diﬀerences between the measured, Em, and
the calculated transition energies, E, without electrons and with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 18 electrons, in units of eV. The
transitions between (n, ℓ = n − 1) states are identiﬁed by the initial (ni) and ﬁnal (nf ) principal quantum numbers
of the atomic levels. In the calculated energies for lead, we included the α(Zα)5,7 vacuum polarization and nuclear
polarization from Ref. [27]. To our knowledge, this information is not available for other nuclei. When there are more
than one measurement available, we use the weighted average for both the transition energy Em and the associated
uncertainty ∆Em, assuming normally distributed errors. The calculated values are compared with the experimental
uncertainty values ∆Em. For the Pb transitions we can use the results of Table VII to estimate the number of residual
electrons for diﬀerent transitions. For the 9 → 8 transitions, our results shows that there must remain at least two
electrons, and are compatible with up to 18 remaining electrons. This is more or less true for all the other transitions
except for the 8 → 7.

In Figure 4 we plot the nuclear radius and the average radius of some kaonic atoms wavefunction as function of Z.
This graph shows when the wavefunction radius and the nuclear radius are of the same order of magnitude. It can
be used to ﬁnd which levels are most aﬀected by the strong-interaction for a given Z value.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work we have evaluated the energies of the circular (n, ℓ = n − 1), 2 ≤ n ≤ 19 and ﬁrst parallel (n, ℓ = n − 2)
levels for several (hydrogenlike) kaonic atoms throughout the periodic table. These energy levels were used to obtain
transition energies to compare to the available experimental and theoretical cases.

Our transition energy calculations reproduce experiments on kaonic atoms within the error bar in the majority of
the cases. In all the cases the theoretical values are more accurate than experimental ones, as the experiments face
the X-ray contamination by other elements.

We have investigated the overlap of the nuclear radius and average radius of kaonic levels as function of Z and the

inﬂuence of electrons that survived the cascade process on the transition energies.

TABLE VII: Diﬀerences between the measured, Em, and the calculated transition energies values, E, without electrons and
with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 18 electrons, respectively, in eV units. The transitions between (n, ℓ = n − 1) states are identiﬁed by the
initial (ni) and ﬁnal (nf ) principal quantum numbers of the atomic levels. ∆Em stands for the experimental uncertainty. For
the cases in which there are more than one measure, the weighted average was taken for both Em and ∆Em. In the case of
the [Li] core the calculation was made for J = ℓkaon + 1/2.

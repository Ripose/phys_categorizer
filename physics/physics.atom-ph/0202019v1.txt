In this paper we present a simple model for computing single electron exchange between light
nuclei. The electronic capture is pictured as a tunnelling process in a model potential. This allows
to analytically compute the transmission probability. Some comparisons with data from existing
literature are given.

INTRODUCTION

Charge exchange processes between atomic particles are of great importance in plasma physics and astrophysics.
By example, it is through this mechanism that energetic charged particles can escape from the core of magnetic
conﬁnement devices; conversely, cold neutral particles coming from the wall can diﬀuse towards the centre.
While only quantum mechanical methods can give really accurate computations of all of the basic quantities for these
processes, i.e. total and partial or diﬀerential cross sections, less precise but simpler methods can still be useful.
It is the case of the Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo
In some cases they can still give high-precision estimates.
(CTMC) method, successfully applied to high-velocity collisions (but recently extended also to the low velocity range,
see, e.g., [1, 2] for a discussion and some recent improvements on this subject), to Rydberg-atom collisions, and to
multiply-charged nuclei. In the low-velocity region, analytical or semi-analytical methods are often used: we mention
here just the Over Barrier Models (OBMs). They are known since a long time [3] and are still being improved to
include as much physics as possible [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
It is worthwhile to notice that, although the computation of charge exchange cross sections is a well developed ﬁeld
of research since several decades, its techniques are by no means completely established:
it may still happen that
theoretical predictions be confuted by experiments or that diﬀerent methods give sharp discrepancies even in relatively
simple situations, that should be quite well diagnosed by now [9]. Therefore, the development of new, diﬀerent methods
of computation can still be valuable. In this work we suggest a fast algorithm to estimate single electron captures.
From the tests that we show in this paper, it appears also rather accurate. It is rooted upon standard OBMs, in
that the electronic capture process is regarded as a potential barrier crossing. Unlike OBMs, however, the electron is
considered as a quantum-mechanical object. This allows to compute also under-barrier crossing events (tunnelling).
In order to reduce the problem to a manageable, semi-analytical form, several geometrical simpliﬁcations will be done.
The results are compared against experimental data as well as other diﬀerent theoretical computations, and are found
to ﬁt them nicely.

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL

We consider a scattering experiment between a nucleus T with one active electron e, and a projectile nucleus
P. Let ρ be the electron position relative to T and R the relative distance between T and P (see Fig. 1). Several
approximations are necessary:
I) All the nuclei are regarded as hydrogenlike particles, thus Zp and Zt are the
eﬀective charge of the projectile and of the target seen by the electron, respectively; II) The two nuclei are considered
as approaching slowly if compared to the orbital electron velocity (adiabatic approximation). This means that the
electron is allowed to complete its path from the target to the projectile before any appreciable relative movement
of the nuclei occurs.
IV) We neglect the
III) We adopt a straight-line approximation for the nuclear trajectory.
possibility of target or projectile ionization. V) Finally, we discard also the possibility of electronic re-capture from
the projectile by the target (although this possibility can be implemented within the algorithm without much eﬀort).

Let us for a while look at the electron as it were a classical particle, and assume that it is initially in a low angular
momentum state (e.g. an s state): this means that its trajectory is a straight segment along the radial direction,
starting from the target nucleus (Fig. 1).
The total energy of the electron is

(Atomic units will be used unless otherwise stated). It is straightforward to work out the value and the position of
the maximum of the potential U along the internuclear axis, as depicted in Fig. 2:

We make the hypothesis that only nearly head-on collisions of the electron on the projectile lead to capture: that
is, captures occur only along or close to the internuclear axis. Let us deﬁne pc as the probability for an electron
impinging exactly along this axis to be captured, and write the capture probability f for electrons impinging within
the solid angle dΩ = sin(ξ)dξdϕ around the internuclear axis as

where δ is the Dirac delta and 4π is a normalization factor accounting for an isotropic distribution of the electronic
velocities. The presence of the delta function means that only electrons whose trajectories are completely lying in the
same plane as the three particles are allowed to be captured.

The total capture probability is P (b) = 1

By reducing everything to one-dimensional geometry, we have chosen to place all of the important physics in the
transmission factor pc: the probability for an electron to cross the potential barrier. This is at a diﬀerence with, e.g.,

If we chose to maintain the classical picture for the electron, we could recover a very simpliﬁed version of Over Barrier
Model, by putting pc = 1 in the region classically allowed to the electron, and zero elsewhere. We instead choose
to compute pc through a quantum-mechanical picture: we model the process of transferring the electron from one
nucleus to the other as a tunnelling process through the potential barrier, with the factor pc which becomes the
transmission factor. Even for this simpliﬁed problem the quantum mechanical transmission factor can be computed
only by complicated numerical techniques. Since the goal of this paper is to write down an algorithm as much
simpliﬁed as possible, we shall replace the true potential with a carefully chosen model one: we use here a simple
square barrier potential. One has to imagine the two nuclei to be placed externally to the barrier, on the two opposite
sides of it. The transmission factor for a particle coming, say, from the left with momentum asymptotically equal to

The coeﬃcients q, kr are the momenta respectively within the barrier and on the right side; L is the barrier width.

Of course, one must also set L = 0 when R < 2∆. Some tests showed that only minor diﬀerences are found if L is
allowed to vary slightly. For example, results shown in the next section remain almost unvaried by using the simpler
choice L = R.
The problem is, at this stage, reduced to performing a double integration: one over time for computing P (b), and
the other one over b for getting σ. Neither of the two quadratures can be done analitically; however, they can be
performed rather easily by using any standard mathematical software package.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We benchmark the model against experimental results from ref.

[10] and the theoretical ones coming from the
molecular approach simulation of ref. [11]. In Fig. (3) we show some typical results for impacts between multicharged
hydrogenlike ions and ground state hydrogen. In all cases, impact velocity is about 1/2 a.u. (it is exactly this value for
0.51). The agreement is fairly good, with our model yielding a

slight underestimate of theoretical results, but the accordance with experiment is pretty nice. The only exception is
the Z = 10 case but, there, it is probable that is the experimental value to be ﬂawed, since it departs rather abruptly
from the general trend.
Tests carried on also for diﬀerent velocities yielded results of comparable accuracy, with some caveat: see next section.

IV. DISCUSSION

Besides being a very simple model to implement, and still being apparently rather accurate, a remarkable feature
of this model is that it is self-consistent: although the parameters L, V0, kl, . . . , have been guessed on the basis of
order-of-magnitude reasonings, none of them is left to the experiment. However, the choice of the model potential
has been arbitrary, constrained only by the condition that it must provide analytical expressions for pc. One could,
therefore, wonder if even better results can be got from a diﬀerent choice of the model potential. The only other such
potential we are aware of is the Eckart potential [12]: it is an approximately bell-shaped potential, and therefore rather
diﬀerent from the curve of Fig. 2. It has, however, the advantage of being smooth, without unphysical discontinuities.
We have done a few tests using it: on the whole, we did ﬁnd-not surprisingly-a worsening of the performances of the

algorithm.
A discussion is, of course, necessary about the range of validity of the algorithm. First of all, care must be taken when
trying to apply this model to diﬀerent velocity regimes: at very low velocity u << 1 the straight-line approximation
for nuclear motion fails. More important, according to a Feynman-like picture, the electron has more time to “sample”
non-rectilinear paths connecting the two nuclei, thus making less correct the reasoning that here yielded to estimate
pc. For high-u (say, u

range of interaction. This functional dependence is stronger that that usually quoted in literature (which is closer to

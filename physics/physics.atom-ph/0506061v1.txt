In order to use a collection of trapped ions for experiments where a well deﬁned preparation of
vibrational states is necessary, all vibrational modes have to be cooled to ensure precise and re-
peatable manipulation of the ions’ quantum states. A method for simultaneous sideband cooling
of all axial vibrational modes is proposed. By application of a magnetic ﬁeld gradient the absorp-
tion spectrum of each ion is modiﬁed such that sideband resonances of diﬀerent vibrational modes
coincide. The ion string is then irradiated with monochromatic electromagnetic radiation, in the
optical or microwave regime, for sideband excitation. This cooling scheme is investigated in detailed
numerical studies. Its application for initializing ion strings for quantum information processing is
extensively discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Atomic ions trapped in an electrodynamic cage allow
for preparation and measurement of individual quantum
systems, and represent an ideal system to investigate
fundamental questions of quantum physics, for instance,
related to decoherence [1, 2], the measurement process
[3, 4], or multiparticle entanglement [5]. Also, trapped
ions satisfy all criteria necessary for quantum computing.
Two internal states of each ion represent one elemen-
tary quantum mechanical unit of information (a qubit).
The quantized vibrational motion of the ions (the “bus-
qubit”) is used as means of communication between indi-
vidual qubits to implement conditional quantum dynam-
ics with two or more qubits [6]. In recent experiments
quantum logic operations with two trapped ions were re-
alized [7] and teleportation of an atomic state has been
demonstrated [8].

These implementations of quantum information pro-
cessing (QIP) with trapped ions require that the ion
string is cooled to low vibrational collective excitations
[6, 7, 9, 10]. In particular, this condition should be ful-
ﬁlled by all collective vibrational modes [11]. Therefore,
in view of the issue of scalable QIP with ion traps, it is
important to ﬁnd eﬃcient cooling schemes that allow to
prepare vibrationally cold ion chains.

Cooling of the vibrational motion of two ions in a com-
mon trap potential has been demonstrated experimen-
tally [12, 13, 14, 15] (see also [16] for a recent review).
This is deemed to be suﬃcient for a quantum information
processor which utilizes two ions at a time for quantum

logic operations with additional ions stored in spatially
separated regions [17]. If more than two ions reside in a
common trap potential and shall be used simultaneously
for quantum logic operations, however, the task of re-
ducing the ions’ motional thermal excitation becomes in-
creasingly challenging with a growing number of ions and
represents a severe obstacle on the way towards scalable
QIP with an ion chain. Straightforward extensions of
laser-cooling schemes for one particle to many ions, like
sequentially applying sideband cooling [16] to each one
of the modes, becomes ineﬃcient as the number of ions
increases, since after having cooled the last mode, the
ﬁrst one may already be considerably aﬀected by heat-
ing due to photon scattering and/or due to ﬂuctuations
of the trap potential. Therefore, it is desirable to ﬁnd a
method that allows for simultaneous and eﬃcient cooling
of many vibrational modes of a chain of ions.

In this article we propose a scheme that allows for si-
multaneous sideband cooling of all collective modes of an
ion chain to the ground state. This is achieved by induc-
ing position dependent Zeeman shifts through a suitably
designed magnetic ﬁeld, thereby shifting the spectrum
of each ion in such a way that the red-sideband tran-
sitions of each mode may occur at the same frequency.
Thus, by irradiating the ion string with monochromatic
radiation all axial modes are cooled. We investigate nu-
merically the eﬃciency and explore implementations of
simultaneous sideband excitation by means of laser light,
and alternatively, by using long-wavelength radiation in
the radio-frequency or microwave regime [18, 19, 20].

The remainder of this article is organized as follows:
In section II the cooling scheme is outlined. Numeri-
cal investigations of the cooling eﬃciency are presented
for implementations using an optical Raman transition
(section III) and a microwave transition (section IV). In

this axis [21]. We denote by νr, νz the radial and ax-

In this section we consider a schematic description of
sideband cooling of an ion chain, in order to introduce the
concepts relevant for the following discussion. We denote
by
the internal states of the ion transition at
frequency ω0, in absence of external ﬁelds, and linewidth
γ. A spatially inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld is applied
that shifts the transition frequency of each ion individu-
ally such that for the ion at position z(0)
the value ωj is
assumed. Each ion transition couples to radiation at fre-
quency ωL, which drives it well below saturation. In this
limit, the contributions of scattering from each ion to the
excitation of the modes add up incoherently [27, 28].

j

For this system, the equations describing the dynamics
of laser sideband cooling of an ion chain can be reduced
to rate equations of the form

qj =

Sα

j Qα

α
X

where Sα
j are the elements of the unitary matrix S
that transforms the dynamical matrix A, characterizing
the ions potential, such that S−1AS is diagonal. The
frequencies, να of the vibrational modes are given by
ν1 where υα are the eigenvalues of A [25]. The
√υα ×
normal modes are excited by displacing an ion from its
equilibrium position z(0)
by an amount qj. Thus, the
coeﬃcients Sα
j describe the strength with which a dis-
placement qj from z(0)
couples to the collective mode α.
Excitation of a vibrational mode can be achieved
through the mechanical recoil associated with the scat-
tering of photons by the ions. This excitation is scaled
by the Lamb-Dicke parameter (LDP) [26], which for a

In this work, we show how the application of a suit-

ing of all modes. In particular, the ﬁeld induces space-
dependent frequency shifts that suitably shape the ex-
citation spectrum of the ions. Simultaneous cooling is
then achieved when for each mode α there is one ion j
with the matching resonance frequency, that is, such that

such that all ions share a common motion-induced reso-

Sideband excitation can be accomplished by either
laser light or microwave radiation according to the
scheme discussed in [18]. With appropriate recycling
schemes this leads to sideband cooling on all N modes
simultaneously. A discussion on how a suitable ﬁeld gra-
dient shifting the ionic resonances in the desired fashion
can be generated is deferred to section V.

As an example, we discuss simultaneous sideband cool-
ing of the collective axial modes of a chain composed of

We evaluate the eﬃciency of the cooling procedure
by neglecting the coupling between diﬀerent vibrational
modes by photon scattering, which is reasonable when
the system is in the Lamb-Dicke regime.
In this case,
the dynamics reduce to solving the equations for each
mode α independently, and the contributions from each
ion to the dynamics of the mode are summed up inco-
herently [27], as outlined in Sec. II B. The steady state
and cooling rates for each mode are evaluated using the
method discussed in [30] and extended to a chain of N
ions. The extension of this method to a chain of ions is
presented in the appendix. The numerical calculations
were carried out for this scheme and chains of N ions
with 1 < N
10 and for some values N > 10. Since the
qualitative conclusions drawn from these calculations did
not depend on N , we therefore restrict the discussion in
sections III, IV, and V to the case N = 10.

A. Sequential cooling

In absence of external ﬁeld gradients shifting inhomo-
geneously the ions transition frequencies (namely, when
ω1 = . . . = ωN = ω0), cooling of an ion chain could
be achieved by applying sideband cooling to each mode
sequentially.
In each step of the sequence all ions are
illuminated simultaneously by laser light with detuning
∆01 =
να, thereby achieving sideband cooling of a par-
ticular mode α. Since all ions are illuminated, they all
contribute to the cooling of mode α.

−

−

In Fig. 3a) the steady state vibrational number of each
mode at the end of the cooling dynamics is displayed as
a function of the relative detuning ∆01. Each mode να
reaches its minimal excitation at values of the detuning
∆01 =
να. Therefore, in order to cool all modes close
to their ground state, the detuning of the laser light has
to be sequentially set to the optimal value for each mode
α.

The cooling rates Γ(α)

cool of mode α at ∆01 =

να, as de-
ﬁned in Eq. (7), are displayed in Fig. 3b). They are diﬀer-
ent for each mode and vary between 1kHz and 100kHz for
the parameters chosen here. Even though these cooling
rates would, in principle, allow for cooling sequentially all
modes in a reasonably short time, this scheme may not
be eﬀective, since while a particular mode α is cooled all
other modes are heated (i) by photon recoil, and, (ii) by
coupling to the environment. As external source of heat-
ing we consider here the coupling of the ions charges to
the ﬂuctuating patch ﬁelds at the electrodes [32]. The
eﬀects of these processes on the eﬃciency of cooling are
discussed in what follows.

−

The consequences of heating due to photon scattering
are visible in Fig. 3a). Here, one can see that while cool-
ing one mode, others can be simultaneously heated, such
that their average phonon number at steady state is very
large. These dynamics are due to the form of the reso-
nances in a three-level conﬁguration [30, 33]. In general,
however, the time scale of heating processes due to pho-
ton scattering is considerably longer than the time scale

5

scattering as source of unwanted heating of modes that
are not being eﬃciently cooled.

Nevertheless, heating by ﬂuctuating electric ﬁelds oc-
curs with appreciable rates ranging between 5s−1 and
104s−1 [32]. The heating rate is diﬀerent for each mode
and was observed to be considerably larger for the COM
mode (here denoted as mode 1) than for modes that
involve diﬀerential relative displacements of individual
ions. Obviously, cooling can only be achieved, if the cool-
ing rate Γ(α)
cool,seq of each mode exceeds in magnitude the
corresponding trap heating rate denoted by Γ(α)

heat:

Γ(α)
heat ≪

Γ(α)

α = 1, . . . , 10 .

(9)

In addition, one must consider that after a particular
mode α has been cooled, it might heat up again while all
other modes, β
= α are being cooled. This imposes a sec-
ond condition on the cooling rate. In order to quantify
this second condition, we ﬁrst evaluate the time, T (α)

thermal distribution, obtained by means of Doppler cool-
ing and characterized by the average occupation number

the COM mode is driven resonantly. In Fig. 4a) the heat-
ing at the blue sideband of the ﬁrst ion, i.e. ∆01 = ν1, is

Figure 5 shows that the COM mode characterized by

eﬃciently, while modes 9 and 10 display much smaller
cooling rates. In particular, Γ(10)

make cooling of this mode very slow at ∆01 =
The origin of this behaviour can be understood as fol-
lows. The scheme of simultaneous sideband cooling re-
quires that each ion of the chain is employed to cool one of
the axial modes. This is achieved by applying a suitable
magnetic ﬁeld gradient. The simplest experimental im-
plementation uses a monotonically increasing magnetic
ﬁeld, such that the ﬁrst ion of the chain is used for cool-
ing mode 1, the second ion mode 2, etc. (compare Fig.
1). However, the coupling of a certain ion displacement
to a certain mode can be very small. It occurs, for in-
stance, that the largest axial excitations couple weakly to

−

7

the ions at the edges of the ion string, instead they are
mainly characterized by oscillations of ions in the center
of the chain [34]. A manifestation of this behavior is the
small value of the matrix element S10
10 . Thus, mode 10 is
not eﬃciently cooled by illuminating ion 10, rather it is
optimally cooled by addressing an ion closer to the cen-
ter of the chain. This is evident by inspection of the grey
bars in Fig. 5 that indicate the optimal cooling rate for
each individual mode, obtained by employing that par-
ticular ion in the chain which has the largest coupling to
the mode to be cooled. In presence of the magnetic ﬁeld
gradient, this optimal cooling rate is achieved, if the de-
tuning, ∆01 is set such that the appropriate red-sideband
transition of this particular ion is driven resonantly. In
this way, the cooling rate is maximal for that particu-
lar mode (i.e., each grey bar corresponds to a diﬀerent
detuning).

For the case of mode 10 the diﬀerence between the
cooling rates depending on which ion is addressed is par-
ticularly striking: the cooling rate of mode 10 at detun-
ν1 (black bar) is very small, as noted above,
ing ∆01 =
whereas the optimal rate Γ(10)
103s−1 (given the
parameters used here) is achieved at ∆01 =
ν1.

Eﬃcient cooling of all modes, given the ﬁeld gradi-
ent that gives rise to the spectrum illustrated in Fig. 1,
can be obtained by combining sequential and simultane-
ous cooling as follows: First the ion string is illuminated
with radiation such that ∆01 =
ν1 which will
eﬃciently cool mode 10 and will have little eﬀect on all
other modes. Then, we apply radiation with ∆01 =
ν1
(cooling rates indicated by black bars in Fig. 5). This
will simultaneously cool all other modes. This is a spe-
ciﬁc recipe to cool 10 ions. For an arbitrary number of
ions, ﬁrst one cools the modes which cannot be eﬃciently
simultaneously cooled with all other modes, and then, in
a second step, as many modes as possible are cooled si-
multaneously (in our case modes 1 through 9).

where Γ(α)
cool,sim is the cooling rate of mode α when si-

tion (15) is the analogue to (9) which we derived for se-
quential cooling. Moreover, since in the scheme proposed
here modes 1 through 9 are simultaneously cooled, a con-
dition analogous to the one in Eq. (12) has to be fulﬁlled
for mode 10 only: After mode 10 has been cooled, this
mode may not heat up again appreciably during the time
for which modes 1 through 9 are simultaneously cooled.
This condition is expressed as

T (10)

C. Comparison of sequential and simultaneous
cooling

So far we have stated the general conditions that have
to be met in order to eﬃciently cool an ion chain with
sequential cooling and with a scheme combining simul-
taneous and sequential sideband cooling. In this section
we discuss their eﬃciencies.

We note that when using sequential sideband cooling,
one may utilize all ions in the chain in order to cool one
mode, where the cooling rates of each ion add up inco-
herently. In the case of simultaneous sideband cooling,
on the other hand, only one ion is employed in order to
cool a particular mode. Assuming that the coupling of
this ion to the mode is suﬃciently large to allow for ef-
ﬁcient cooling, the following expression for the average
simultaneous cooling rate is deduced

where Γcool,seq is the cooling rate for sequential cooling
averaged over all modes. Thus, for simultaneous cooling
relation (15) yields

Γ(α)

Γ<,sim ,

Γcool,seq ≡
From (18), since the total cooling rate is Γ<,seq =
Γcool,seq/N , one obtains that the eﬃciencies of simulta-
neous and sequential cooling are comparable. However,
it should be remarked that this estimate corresponds to
the worst case for simultaneous cooling.
In fact, esti-
mate (18) is correct for long-wavelength vibrational exci-
tations, which correspond to low-frequency axial modes,

where practically all ions of the chain participate in the
mode oscillation. Short-wavelength excitations, on the
other hand, are characterized by large displacements of
the central ions, while the ions at the edges practically
do not move [34]. Due to this property, for these modes
one may ﬁnd a magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration such that
Γ(α)
cool,sim ∼
On the basis of these qualitative considerations, one
may in general state that simultaneous cooling of the
chain is at least as eﬃcient as sequential cooling. For
the conﬁguration discussed in this paper the two meth-
ods are comparable. Diﬀerently from sequential cooling,
however, the eﬃciency of simultaneous cooling can be
substantially improved by choosing a suitable magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration that maximizes coupling of each mode
to one ion of the chain.

IV. SIDEBAND COOLING USING
MICROWAVE FIELDS

A. Eﬀective Lamb-Dicke parameter

We investigate now sideband cooling of the ion chain’s
collective motion using microwave radiation for driving
the sideband transition.
It should be remarked that
in this frequency range sideband excitation cannot be
achieved by means of photon recoil which for long wave-
lengths is negligible. This is evident from eq. 4 using a
typical trap frequency, να of the order 2π
1MHz. Never-
theless, in [18] it was shown that with the application of
a magnetic ﬁeld gradient an additional mechanical eﬀect
can be produced accompanying the absorption/emission
of a photon. This is achieved by realizing diﬀerent me-
chanical potentials for the states
[4, 18, 19].
Hence, by changing an ion’s internal state by stimulated
absorption or emission of a microwave photon the ion
experiences a mechanical force.

We study sideband cooling using microwave radiation

employed (i.e., Ω01 = 5
2πkHz,
2πMHz). The eﬀective LDP is determined

glects the fourth and sixth orders in the LDP expansion
of the optical transition of the repumping cycle, which are
of the same order of magnitude as the microwave side-
band excitation. Nevertheless, given the complexity of
the problem, characterized by a large number of degrees
of freedom, we have chosen to use this simpler method
in order to get an indicative estimate of the eﬃciency as
compared to the case in which the sidebands are driven
by optical radiation. Therefore, the results we obtain in
this section are indicative. In fact, neglecting higher or-
ders in the LDP of the optical transition corresponds to
underestimate heating eﬀects due to diﬀusion.

using an optical Raman processes (Fig. 4d) shows that

considerably larger.

obtained when driving the sideband transition with mi-
crowave radiation. These rates are much smaller than the
ones shown in Fig. 5 that are obtained using an optical
Raman process.

From this comparison it is evident that simultaneous
cooling is more eﬀective by using an optical Raman pro-
cess than microwave radiation. In particular, the cool-
ing rates obtained with simultaneous microwave sideband
cooling can be comparable to the heating rates in some
experimental situations, resulting in ineﬃcient cooling.

This striking diﬀerence in the eﬃciency can already be
found, if comparing the two methods when they are ap-
plied to cooling a single ion.
Its origin lies in the fact
that in the optical case the LDP accounting for the pho-
ton recoil, namely ηα
j in Eq. (20), is considerably larger
than the LDP, εα
j caused by the magnetic ﬁeld gradi-
ent used here to superimpose the motional sidebands.
This can be veriﬁed by using an optical wavelength in
Eq. (22) which gives ηeﬀ
ηα
j . On the other hand, driv-
transition directly by microwaves results
ing the
in ηeﬀ
ηα
j . For the model system considered
here, the optical LDP is at least one order of magnitude
larger than the microwave LDP for simultaneous cooling.
In the microwave sideband cooling scheme optical tran-
sitions are used for repumping, thus leading to an en-
hanced diﬀusion rate during the dynamics and thus to
lower eﬃciencies. The fundamental features of these dy-
namics can be illustrated by a rate equation of the form
Eq. (5), describing sideband cooling of a single ion with
microwave radiation, where the rates are

a sideband transition occurs by microwave excitation,
whereas ηopt multiplies the terms where sideband exci-
tation occurs by means of spontaneous emission, which
thus describe the diﬀusion during the cooling process.

Note that the parameter ε can be made larger by in-
creasing the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient,
which in Eq. (22) corresponds to increasing κα
j . However,
if the modes of an ion chain are to be cooled simultane-
ously, the choice of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient is ﬁxed by
the distance between neighboring ions, and the eﬃciency
is thus limited by this requirement.

If an individual ion (or a neutral atom conﬁned, for ex-
ample, in an optical dipole trap) is to be sideband cooled,
or sequential cooling is applied to a chain of ions, then
the above mentioned restriction on the magnitude of ε is
not present and microwave sideband cooling can be as ef-
ﬁcient as Raman cooling. For this case, method [30] may
be implemented, provided the Lamb-Dicke regime applies
and ηopt and ǫ are of the same order of magnitude.

V. EXPERIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

In this section we discuss how the magnetic ﬁeld gradi-
ent for simultaneous sideband cooling can be generated
and how cooling is aﬀected, if the red motional sidebands
of diﬀerent vibrational modes are not perfectly super-
posed. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the pro-
posed scheme it is suﬃcient to restrict the discussion to
very simple arrangements of magnetic ﬁeld generating
coils.

The use of a position dependent ac-Stark shift has been
proposed in [36] to modify the spectrum of a linear ion
chain. This may be another way of appropriately shifting
the sideband resonances but will not be considered here.

A. Required magnetic ﬁeld gradient

If the vibrational resonances and the ions were equally
spaced in frequency and position space, respectively, then
a constant ﬁeld gradient, appropriately chosen, could
make all N modes overlap and let them be cooled at
να−1 decreases monotonically
the same time. Since να −
with growing α and the ions’ mutual distances vary with
zj, the magnetic ﬁeld gradient has to be adjusted along
the z
axis. The ﬁeld gradient needed to shift the ions’
resonances by the desired amount is obtained from

currents -5.33A, -6.46A, and 4.29A,respectively, through
these coils produces the desired ﬁeld gradient at the lo-
cation of the ions. Micro electromagnets with dimen-
sions of a few tens of micrometers and smaller are now
routinely used in experiments where neutral atoms are
trapped and manipulated [38]. Current densities up to
108A/cm2 have been achieved in such experiments. A
current density more than two orders of magnitude less
than was achieved in atom trapping experiments would
suﬃce in the above mentioned example.

This conﬁguration of magnetic ﬁeld coils shall serve as
an example to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed
It will be shown that
cooling scheme in what follows.
with such few current carrying elements in this simple
arrangement one may obtain good results when simul-
taneously sideband cooling all axial modes. More so-
phisticated structures for generating the magnetic ﬁeld
gradients can of course be employed, making use of more
coils, diﬀerent diameters, variable currents, or completely
diﬀerent conﬁgurations of current carrying structures.

Ideally, all 10 sideband resonances would be super-
imposed for optimal cooling. The resonances shown in

rameters for the highest vibrational mode (α = 10) is
about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than for mode 1,
since ion 10 is only slightly displaced from its equilibrium
position when mode 10 is excited (compare the discussion

We will now investigate how well simultaneous cooling
can be done with the sideband resonances not perfectly
superposed.

B. Simultaneous Raman cooling with non-ideal
gradient

In Fig. 9a) the steady state vibrational excitation,
n(α)
if of a string of 10 ions is displayed as a function
h
of the detuning of the Raman beams relative to the res-
onance frequency ω1 of ion 1. The Rabi frequencies and
detuning, too, are the same as have been used to generate
Fig. 4. However, the ﬁeld gradient that shifts the ions’
resonances is not assumed ideal as in Fig. 4, instead the
one generated by three single windings as described above
(Fig. 7) has been used. Despite the imperfect superpo-
sition of the cooling resonances, low temperatures of all
modes close to their ground state can be achieved as can

crowave or rf signals can be controlled with high precision
and display low enough drift to ensure eﬃcient cooling. If
a large enough intensity of the repump laser is employed,
then the steady state vibrational excitation varies slowly
as a function of ∆01 as is visible in Fig. 10b. Thus,
the requirements regarding both the precision of adjust-
ment and the drift of the source generating the Raman
diﬀerence frequency are further relaxed.

It should be noted that eﬃcient cooling does not only
occur around the resonance ∆01 =
ν1 but also at other
values of ∆01 as can be seen in Fig. 10a. As an example,
if of all modes at that detuning,
Fig. 10d shows
∆01 =
3.91ν1 where mode 10 reaches its absolute min-
imum. At this resonance the red sideband of the 5th
ion corresponding to the 10th mode is driven by the Ra-
man beams (compare Fig. 1). Note that all other vibra-
tional modes are also cooled at the same time. Therefore,
an eﬃcient procedure for cooling all vibrational modes
close to their ground state would be to ﬁrst tune the
Raman beams such that mode 10 is optimally cooled
(i.e., ∆01 =
3.91ν1, Fig. 10d), and subsequently set
∆01 =
1.022ν1 (Fig. 10c) in order to simultaneously
cool modes 1 through 9. This approach is discussed in
more detail in section III B 1.

Initial cooling of vibrational modes often is prerequi-
site for subsequent coherent manipulation of internal and
motional degrees of freedom of an ion chain, for example,
quantum logic operations. When implementing quantum
logic operations it may not be advantageous to address
all motional sidebands with a single frequency as is done
here for simultaneous sideband cooling. The magnetic
ﬁeld gradient that superposes the sideband resonances
for cooling may then be turned oﬀ adiabatically after ini-
tial Raman cooling of all vibrational modes. This should
be done fast enough not to allow for appreciable heating
of the ion string, for example, by patch ﬁelds, and slow
enough not to excite vibrational modes in the process.
A lower limit for the time it takes to ramp up the gra-
dient seems to be 2π/ν1. Thus, with ν1 = 1
2πMHz
the additional time needed to change the ﬁeld gradient is
negligible compared to the time needed to sideband cool
the ion string which for typical parameters takes between
a few hundred µs and a few ms (compare Fig. 5).

×

If microwave radiation is used to coherently manip-
ulate internal and motional degrees of freedom and for
quantum logic operations, it is useful not to turn oﬀ the
magnetic ﬁeld gradient, but instead to ramp up the ﬁeld
gradient to a value where all coincidences between inter-
nal and motional resonances are removed [4, 18]. Also, a
larger ﬁeld gradient for quantum logic operations is de-
sirable in this case to have stronger coupling between in-
ternal and external states (i.e., a larger eﬀective LDP ηeﬀ
jα
[eq. 20]). The considerations in the previous paragraph
regarding the time scale of change of the ﬁeld gradient

13

apply here, too.

For the cooling scheme introduced here to work, the
ﬁeld gradient has to vary in the axial direction and it
remains to be shown in what follows that this variation is
compatible with the neglect of higher-order terms in the
local displacement qj of ion j and in ∂zB in the derivation
of the eﬀective Lamb-Dicke parameter induced by the
magnetic ﬁeld gradient [18, 19]. Neglecting higher order

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have proposed a scheme for cooling the vibrational
motion of ions in a linear trap conﬁguration. Axial vi-
brational modes are simultaneously cooled close to their
ground state by superimposing the red motional side-
bands in the absorption spectrum of diﬀerent ions such
that the red sideband of each mode is excited when driv-
ing an internal transition of the ions with monochromatic
radiation. This spectral property is achieved by apply-
ing a magnetic ﬁeld gradient along the trap axis shifting
individually the internal ionic resonances by a desired
amount.

Exemplary results of numerical simulations for the case
of an ion chain consisting of N = 10 ions are presented
and extensively discussed. Detailed simulations have also
been carried out with 1 < N < 10 and for some values
N > 10. They lead to the same qualitative conclusion as
presented for the case of N = 10.

Numerical studies show that simultaneously Raman
cooling all axial modes is eﬀective for realistic sets of pa-
rameters. These studies also reveal that using microwave
radiation to drive the sideband transition is not as eﬃ-
cient, due to the relatively small mechanical eﬀect associ-
ated with the excitation of this transition. The mechan-
ical eﬀect could be enhanced by applying a larger mag-
netic ﬁeld gradients. For simultaneous sideband cooling
of all vibrational modes, however, the gradient is ﬁxed by
the requirement of superimposing the sidebands. Usual
sideband cooling on a hyperﬁne or Zeeman transition us-
ing microwave radiation becomes possible, if a larger ﬁeld

gradient is used. This may be particularly useful, if a
single ion (or an atom in an optical dipole trap) is to be
sideband cooled using a microwave transition, or, if the
vibrational modes of an ion chain are to be cooled sequen-
tially using microwave radiation. Moreover, these tech-
niques could also be implemented for sympathetic cooling
of an ion chain, whereby some modes are simultaneously
cooled by addressing ions of other species embedded in
the chain [27, 39, 40].

In conclusion, we have shown that simultaneous side-
band cooling with optical radiation can be eﬃciently im-
plemented taking into account experimental conditions
and even for a simple arrangement of magnetic ﬁeld gen-
erating elements.

VIII. APPENDIX

In this appendix we introduce the hamiltonian and
master equation describing the dynamics discussed in
Sec. IV B. We consider a chain consisting of N identical
ions aligned along the z-axis, and in presence of a mag-
netic ﬁeld B(z). The internal electronic states of each ion
which are relevant for the dynamics are the stable states
. The transitions

where the index j labels the ions along the chain. The

dent of the internal states. Denoting with Qα, Pα the

lator at frequency να, the Hamiltonian for the external

[29] The selection rules actually prohibit a direct radiative
transition between |2i and |0i, which in this case corre-
spond to the 171Yb+states P1/2, F = 0 and S1/2, F = 0,
respectively. Here, we assume that a ﬁeld is present, cou-
pling P1/2, F = 0 and P1/2, F = 1, thus allowing to have
a transition from P1/2, F = 0 to S1/2, F = 0 with ad-
justable rate.

[35] Experimental data on the heating rates of each individual
mode for 10 ions seem not to be available. For the purpose
of computing the relevant time scales for simultaneous
and sequential cooling therefore, the heating rates were
set to zero in equations 11 and 17. For simplicity it was
assumed that hnii and hnif take on the same value for
each mode.

[37] Wires with rather small diameter can be used for these
coils when they are in contact with a suitable heat sink.
See, for instance: J. Fortagh, A. Grossmann, C. Zimmer-
mann, T. W. H¨ansch: Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 5310 (1998).

[41] It is expected that mode 10 is much less susceptible to
heating by stray ﬁelds (the dominant heating mechanism
as discussed in section III A) than the COM mode [32].
Therefore, such a low cooling rate will suﬃce once this
mode is close to its ground state. However, in order to
initially bring it close to the ground state the rate Γ10
needs to be larger.

Relativistic many-body calculations of excitation energies and transition rates in
ytterbium-like ions

Excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and transition rates are calculated for (5d2 + 5d6s + 6s2)–
(5d6p + 5d5f + 6s6p) electric dipole transitions in Yb-like ions with nuclear charges Z ranging from
72 to 100. Relativistic many-body perturbation theory (RMBPT), including the retarded Breit
interaction, is used to evaluate retarded E1 matrix elements in length and velocity forms. The
calculations start from a [Xe]4f 14 core Dirac-Fock potential. First-order RMBPT is used to obtain
intermediate coupling coeﬃcients, and second-order RMBPT is used to determine matrix elements.
A detailed discussion of the various contributions to energy levels and dipole matrix elements is given
for ytterbium like rhenium, Z=75. The resulting transition energies are compared with experimental
values and with results from other recent calculations. Trends of excitation energies, line strengths,
oscillator strengths, and transition rates as functions of nuclear charge Z are shown graphically for
selected states and transitions. These calculations are presented as a theoretical benchmark for
comparison with experiment and theory.

INTRODUCTION

We report results of ab initio calculations of excitation
energies, oscillator strengths, and transition rates in Yb-
like ions with nuclear charges Z ranging from 72 to 100.
The ions considered here, starting from doubly ionized
Hf III, all have 5d2 ground states. We do not consider
Yb I and Lu II both of which have a 6s2 ground state con-
ﬁguration. In recent publications [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], the
spectra of Re VI, Os VII, and Ir VIII were studied and
energies levels of the 5d2, 5d6s, 5d6p, 5d5f and 6s6p con-
ﬁgurations were determined. The Cowan Hartree-Fock
code [8] with relativistic and correlation options was used
in Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] to calculate energy levels and
to carry out least-squares adjustments of energies.

Although we do not consider Yb I and Lu II here, it
should be noted that Porsev et al. [9] recently carried
out elaborate calculations of electric-dipole amplitudes
in atomic ytterbium. Moreover, Martin et al. [10] listed
energies for 249 levels of Yb I and 40 levels of Lu II.

In the present paper, we use relativistic many-body
perturbation theory (RMBPT) to determine energies of
the 14 even-parity 5d2, 5d6s, and 6s2 states and the
36 odd-parity 5d6p, 5d5f , and 6s6p states for Yb-like
ions. We illustrate our calculation with a detailed study
of Re VI, Z= 75. Our ﬁrst-order RMBPT calculations

include both the Coulomb and retarded Breit interac-
tions but our second-order calculations are limited to the
Coulomb interaction only.

Reduced matrix elements,

line strengths, oscillator
strengths, and transition rates are determined for all al-
lowed and forbidden electric-dipole transitions between
even-parity (5d2 + 5d6s + 6s2) and odd-parity (5d6p +
5d5f + 6s6p) states. Retarded E1 matrix elements are
evaluated in both length and velocity forms. RMBPT
calculations that start from a local potential are gauge
independent order-by-order, provided “derivative terms”
are included in second- and higher-order matrix elements
and careful attention is paid to negative-energy states.
The present calculations start from a nonlocal [Xe]4f 14
Dirac-Fock (DF) potential and consequently give gauge-
dependent transition matrix elements. Second-order cor-
relation corrections compensate almost exactly for the
gauge dependence of the ﬁrst-order matrix elements and
lead to corrected matrix elements that diﬀer by less than
5% in length and velocity forms for all of the ions con-
sidered here.

Energies from the present calculation agree well with
results given in Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] for low-lying lev-
els, but disagree substantially for various highly-excited
levels, as discussed later.

The RMBPT formalism developed previously [11, 12,
13, 14, 15] for Be-, Mg-, and Ca-like ions is used here to
describe perturbed wave functions, to obtain the second-
order energies [11], and to evaluate ﬁrst- and second-

order transition matrix elements [13].
Ions of the Yb
sequence, starting from the Hf III ion [16] and continu-
ing onward have a 5d2 ground state. This is similar to
the previously studied Ca sequence [15], where ions start-
ing from Ti III have a 3d2 ground state. The primary
diﬀerences between calculations for Ca-like and Yb-like
ions arise from the increased number of the orbitals in
the DF core potential, [Xe]4f 14 instead of [Ar] ([Ar] =

2

1s22s22p63s23p6 and [Xe] = [Ar] 3d104s24p64d105s25p6),
and the strong mixing between both even-parity (5d2 +
5d6s + 6s2) and odd-parity (5d6p + 5d5f + 6s6p) states.
These diﬀerences lead to much more laborious numeri-
cal calculations. The calculations are carried out using
sets of DF basis orbitals that are linear combinations of
B-splines. These B-spline basis orbitals are determined
using the method described in Ref. [17]. We use 40 B-
splines of order 8 for each single-particle angular momen-
tum state and we include all orbitals with orbital angular
momentum l ≤ 7 in our basis set.

A. Model space

The model spaces for the (5d2 + 5d6s + 6s2) and
(5d6p + 5d5f + 6s6p) complexes in Yb-like ions have
14 even-parity states and 36 odd-parity states, respec-
tively. These states are summarized in Table I, where
both jj and LS designations are given. When start-
ing calculations from DF wave functions, it is natural
to use jj designations for uncoupled matrix elements;
however, neither jj- nor LS-coupling describes physical
states properly, except for the single-conﬁguration state
5d5/25f7/2(6) ≡ 5d5f 3H6. The strong mixing between
5d6p, 5d5f , and 6s6p states was discussed previously in
Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

Details of the theoretical method used to evaluate
second-order energies for ions with two valence electrons
are given in Refs.
[11, 12] and will not be repeated
here. The energy calculations are illustrated in Table
II, where we list contributions to the energies of odd-
parity J = 0 states of Re+5. We present zeroth-, ﬁrst-,
and second-order Coulomb energies E(0), E(1), and E(2)
together with the ﬁrst-order retarded Breit corrections
B(1) [18]. It should be mentioned that the diﬀerence be-
tween ﬁrst-order Breit corrections calculated with and
without retardation is less than 2%. As one can see
from Table II, the ratio of oﬀ-diagonal to diagonal ma-
trix elements is larger for second-order contributions than
for ﬁrst-order contributions. Another diﬀerence between
ﬁrst- and second-order contributions concerns symme-
try properties: ﬁrst-order oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements
are symmetric, whereas second-order oﬀ-diagonal matrix
elements are unsymmetric (Lindgren and Morrison [19,
Indeed, E(2)[Q, Q′] and E(2)[Q′, Q] diﬀer in
chap. 9]).
some cases by 20-50% and occasionally even have oppo-
site signs. The ratio of oﬀ-diagonal to diagonal matrix
elements for Breit corrections B(1) is much smaller than
for Coulomb corrections.

After evaluating the energy matrices, we calculate
eigenvalues and eigenvectors for states with given val-
ues of J and parity. There are two possible methods
to carry out the diagonalization: either diagonalize the

sum of zeroth- and ﬁrst-order matrices, then calculate
the second-order contributions using the resulting eigen-
vectors; or diagonalize the sum of the zeroth-, ﬁrst- and
second-order matrices together. Following Ref. [12], we
choose the second method here.

The energy calculations are illustrated for Re+5 in Ta-
ble III. Energies listed under the heading “Absolute
energies” are given relative to the [Xe]4f 14 core, while
those listed under the heading “Excitation energies” are
given relative to the 5d2 3F2 ground state.
In the ta-
ble, we present absolute zeroth- plus ﬁrst-order Coulomb
and Breit energies E(0+1) = E(0) + E(1) + B(1), absolute
second-order Coulomb energies E(2), and the sum E(tot).
We also give the breakdown excitation energies and total
excitation energies E(exc). As can be seen from the table,
the second-order contribution is about 3% of the abso-
lute energy but accounts for 5% – 15% of the excitation
energy. This table clearly illustrates the importance of
including second-order contributions. As mentioned pre-
viously, neither jj- nor LS-coupling describes physical
states properly; nevertheless, we use LS designations to
label levels. We organize levels in the table according to
decreasing values of E(0+1). After including second-order
corrections, the present ordering diﬀers in some cases
from the ordering according to decreasing E(tot). Thus,
the ordering of 5d2 3F4 and 5d2 3P0 levels, 5d5f 3H5 and
5d5f 3F2 levels, and 5d5f 3G4 and 6s6p 1P1 levels are
interchanged in Re+5 after second-order corrections are
added.

Problems arising when using diﬀerent model spaces in
RMBPT theory were examined by Johnson et al. [12]. A
major diﬀerence between Yb-like and Be-like systems, is
that we could not construct as complete a model space
for a two-electron system with a [Xe]4f 14 core as we did
for a system with a [He] core [11]. To do so would re-
quire us to include all possible two-particle states that
could be constructed from unoccupied n=5 and n=6 or-
bitals in our model space.
In the case of Be-like ions,
the model space is much simpler, being constructed from
n=2 orbitals only. A second, but related, problem is that
diﬀerent model spaces lead to diﬀerent results. For ex-
ample, energy levels of Hg I, calculated using RMBPT
with (6s6p) and (6s2 + 6p2) model spaces diﬀered from
those calculated with (6s6p+6p6d) and (6s2 +6p2+6s6d)
model spaces by about 500 cm−1 [12]. We conﬁrm this
result here comparing calculations of 5p6d energy levels
starting from a 5p6d model space and those starting from
(5p6d + 5d5f ) or (5p6d + 5d5f + 6s6p) model spaces in
Re+5. The largest diﬀerence occurs in the E(2), which
changes by 1000 cm−1 in some cases. The change in
E(0+1) is smaller by a factor of two and has an opposite
sign. The resulting change in E(tot) is about 500 cm−1.
Similar tests of model-space dependence along the Yb se-
quence set a limit of about 500 cm−1 on the accuracy of
the present second-order calculations.

C. Z-dependence of energies

compensated by “derivative terms” P (derv).

One unique feature of the present calculations is
the inclusion of second-order correlation corrections.
We illustrate the Z-dependence of the second-order
energy E(2)
in Fig. 1 for even-parity levels with
J=2 (5d2 3F2, 1D2, 3P2 and 5d6s 1,3D2) and J=3, 4
(5d2 3F3, 3F4, 1G4 and 5d6s 3D3). As can see from
this ﬁgure, the second-order energy, E(2) slowly increases
with Z in the range 3–5×104 cm−1. The smooth Z-
dependence for these nine terms is exceptional and is not
found for other terms discussed below.

Excitation energies E(exc) of even-parity and odd-
parity states relative to the 5d2 3F2 ground state, divided
by (Z − 65)2, are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Both designa-
tions are shown in these ﬁgures: LS for low Z and jj for
high Z. The variation of the 5d2 levels with Z shown
in Fig. 2a. Strong mixing between 5d3/25d5/2(J) and
5d5/25d5/2(J) states with J=2 or 4 leads to rapid vari-
ations with Z in the corresponding Grotrian diagrams.
Note that the 1D2 and 3F4 levels cross between Z=79
and 80, 3P0 and 3F3 levels cross between Z=80 and 81,
and 3P1 and 3F4 levels cross between Z=93 and 94. We
give excitation energies of the other ﬁve even-parity 5d6s
and 6s2 levels in Fig. 2b. Two small sharp features in
the 6s2 level occur at Z=82 and Z=85. The origin of
these irregularities is discussed in Appendix A. Energies
of odd-parity levels with J=0 and 4, including mixing of
5d6p, 5d5f and 6s6p states, are given in Fig. 3. The sharp
features in the curves describing 5d5f and 6s6p states are
similar to those mentioned above for even-parity states
and discussed in Appendix A. Avoided level crossings for
the odd-parity J = 0 levels are seen Fig. 3a near Z=76
and Z=84. Similar avoided crossings can be observed for
the odd-parity complex with J=4 in Fig. 3b.

D. Z-dependence of matrix elements for
electric-dipole transitions

We designate the ﬁrst-order dipole matrix element by
Z (1), the Coulomb correction to the second-order matrix
element by Z (2), and the second-order Breit correction by
B(2). The evaluation of Z (1), Z (2), and B(2) for Yb-like
ions follows the pattern of the corresponding calculation
for beryllium-like ions in Refs. [13, 20]. These matrix ele-
ments are calculated in both length and velocity gauges.
Diﬀerences between length and velocity forms, are illus-
trated for the uncoupled 5d3/25d5/2(2)-5d5/26p1/2(3) ma-
trix element in Fig. 4. The second-order Breit matrix el-
ement B(2) is multiplied by a factor of 50 in order to put
it on the same scale as the second-order Coulomb matrix
element Z (2). The sharp features have the same origin as
those in the the second-order energy matrix and are dis-
cussed in Appendix B. Contributions of the second-order
matrix elements Z (2) and B(2) are much larger in veloc-
ity (V ) form than in length (L) form as seen in panels
(a) and (b) of Fig. 4. As shown later, L–V diﬀerences are

L and Z (2)

L and Z (1)

We list uncoupled ﬁrst- and second-order dipole ma-
trix elements Z (1), Z (2), B(2), together with derivative
terms P (derv)
for Re+5 in Table IV. For simplicity,
we consider only the 9 dipole transitions between even-
parity states with J=0 and odd-parity states with J=1.
The derivative terms shown in Table IV arise because
transition amplitudes depend on energy, and the transi-
tion energy changes order-by-order in perturbation the-
ory. Both L and V forms are given for the matrix el-
ements. We see that the ﬁrst-order matrix elements
L and Z (1)
Z (1)
diﬀer by 10-20% and that the L–V dif-
ferences between second-order matrix elements are much
larger for some transitions. The ﬁrst-order matrix ele-
ments Z (1)
are non-zero for the three matrix
V
5d3/25d3/2(0)–
elements 5d3/25d3/2(0)–5d3/26p1/2(1),
5d3/26p3/2(1), and 5d5/25d5/2(0)–5d5/26p3/2(1), but van-
ish for the remaining six transitions. Moreover, those six
transitions, Z (2)
V have the same order of mag-
nitude as the three non-zero ﬁrst-order matrix elements.
This conﬁrms the importance of including higher-order
RMBPT corrections. It can also see from Table IV that
P (derv)
is smaller than
L
Z (1)
V by ﬁve to six orders of magnitude.
In Table V, line strengths for Re+5 in length and veloc-
ity forms are given for the J=0–J ′=1 transitions consid-
ered in Table IV as well as for other J–J ′ transitions. We
see that L and V forms of the coupled matrix elements in
Table V diﬀer only in the second or third digits. As men-
tioned in the introduction, these L–V diﬀerences arise
because we start our RMBPT calculations using a non-
local DF potential. If we were to replace the DF potential
by a local potential, the diﬀerences would disappear com-
pletely. Another source of L–V diﬀerences is the use of
an incomplete model space. The last two columns in Ta-
ble V show L and V values of line strengths calculated
without the second-order contribution. As can be seen,
including second-order corrections signiﬁcantly decreases
L–V diﬀerences.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We calculate energies of the 14 even-parity 5d2, 5d6s,
and 6s2 states as well as the 36 odd-parity 5d6p, 5d5f ,
and 6s6p states for Yb-like ions with nuclear charges in
the range Z = 72 to 100. Reduced matrix elements, line
strengths, oscillator strengths, and transition rates are
also determined for all electric-dipole transitions between
even-parity and odd-parity states for each ion. Compar-
isons with experimental data and other theoretical results
are also given. Our results are presented in three parts:
transition energies, ﬁne-structure energy diﬀerences, and

trends of line strengths, oscillator strengths, and transi-
tion rates.

A. Transition energies

In Table VI, transition energies are compared with re-
cent measurements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. We obtain good
agreement with the experiment for low-lying 5d2, 5d6s,
and 5d6p levels. We also we obtain reasonable agree-
ment (500 -1000 cm−1) for highly-excited 5d5f levels in
Re VI, Os VII, and Ir VIII ions. However, we disagree
substantially (2000 -10000 cm−1) for 5d5f levels in Pt IX,
Au X, and Hg XI ions. As mentioned in Refs. [4, 5, 6],
mixing between levels of the 5d5f conﬁguration and the
core excited conﬁgurations with a 5p hole could be very
important for Pt IX, Au X, and Hg XI ions. Indeed, sub-

7

stantial mixing of the 5p55d3 and 5p65d5f conﬁgurations
was found in Ref. [6]. From this, we conclude that the
present values for 5d5f conﬁgurations in Pt IX, Au X,
and Hg XI are less reliable (∼ 1%) than data for Re VI,
Os VII, and Ir VIII.

B. Fine structure of the 5d6p triplets

The ﬁne-structure intervals for the 3P , 3D, and 3F
terms of 5d6p conﬁguration divided by (Z − 65)2 are
shown in Fig. 5. The ﬁne structures of these levels do
not follow the Land´e rules even for small Z; the 3P lev-
els are partially inverted, while the 3D and 3F levels
show regular ordering of the ﬁne-structure splittings for
both low and high Z. The unusual splittings are caused
by changes from LS to jj coupling and by mixing from
other triplet and singlet states. Comparisons are made
with experimental data from [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] in Fig. 5.
Excellent agreement (0.3% – 3%) is found for the four in-
tervals 3P1–3P0, 3D3–3D2, 3F4–3F3, and 3F3–3F2. The
agreement decreases for the 3P2–3P1 and 3D2–3D1 inter-
vals, from 10% for Re+5 to 2% for Hg+10. Experimental
energies for other ions would be very helpful in conﬁrm-
ing the Z dependence shown in Fig. 5.

C. Line strengths and oscillator strengths in
Yb-like ions

Trends of the Z dependence of line strengths and os-
cillator strengths, are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. In Fig. 6,
we illustrate the Z dependence of line strengths for the
four 5d2–5d6p transitions calculated (a) by RMBPT and
(b) in ﬁrst-order to illustrate once again the impor-
tance of including second-order matrix elements. Com-
paring the curves in Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b, we can see
that the Z dependence is the same for both cases ex-
cept for the small region Z = 80–88. The singular-
ities in this region are already present for uncoupled
dipole matrix elements. The second-order contribution
for the 5d3/25d5/2(2)–5d5/26p1/2(3) uncoupled matrix el-
ement is shown in Fig. 4. Similar singularities appeared
for other uncoupled matrix elements between even-parity
J=2 states and odd-parity J=3 states. Consequently,
those singularities also appear in the coupled matrix ele-
ments and the line strengths shown in Fig. 6.

The Z dependence is more complicated for transitions
between even-parity states with J=1 and odd-parity
states with J=0, as seen in Fig. 7, where we give os-
cillator strengths for four transitions calculated (a) by
RMBPT and (b) in ﬁrst-order. The oscillator strength
curves are not smooth functions of Z, even in ﬁrst-order.
The singularities shown in the four curves of Fig. 7b arise
from the strong mixing between three states of the odd-
parity complex with J=0. The mixing of 5d5/25d5/2,
5d3/26p3/2, and 6s1/26p1/2 states was discussed earlier in
Fig. 3a where it was shown that avoided crossings occur

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, a systematic second-order RMBPT study
of the energies of the 5d2, 5d6s, 6s2, 5d6p, 5d5f , and 6s6p
states of Yb-like ions has been presented. These calcu-
lations agree with existing experimental energy data for
intermediate Z=75 to 80 at the level of 500-1000 cm−1
for low-lying 5d2, 5d6s, and 5d6p levels. They provide a
smooth theoretical reference database for the identiﬁca-
tion of lines.

Also presented is a systematic second-order relativis-
line
tic RMBPT study of reduced matrix elements,
strengths, oscillator strengths, and transition rates for
allowed and forbidden electric-dipole transitions in Yb-
like ions with nuclear charges ranging from Z = 72 to
100. The dipole matrix elements include retardation and
correlation corrections from Coulomb and Breit interac-
tions. Both length and velocity forms of the matrix el-
ements are evaluated, and ∼ 5 % diﬀerences, caused by
the non-locality of the starting DF potential, are found
between the two forms.

We believe that our results will be useful in analyz-
ing existing experimental data and planning new exper-
iments. There remains a paucity of experimental data
for many of the higher ionized members of this sequence,
both for term energies and for transition probabilities and
lifetimes. Additionally, matrix elements from the present
calculations will provide basic theoretical input for calcu-
lations of reduced matrix elements, oscillator strengths,
and transition rates in three-electron Lu-like ions.

APPENDIX A: THE SECOND-ORDER
DOUBLE-EXCITATION CONTRIBUTION

Here, we consider the second-order double-excitation
contribution to explain singularities in the Z dependence
of energy levels given in Figs. 2 and 3. A typical contri-
bution from one of the double-excitation diagram for the

10

second-order interaction energy has the form [11]
Xk(vwmn)Xk′ (mnv′w′)
ǫv′ + ǫw′ − ǫm − ǫn

Al(vw; v′w′) ∝ X

X
kk′

mn

, (A1)

where Xk′ (vwmn) are products of angular coupling coef-
ﬁcients and Slater integrals [11], ǫm is the single-particle
energy for state m, and v designates a single-particle va-
lence state (nvlvjv). For the case of a [Xe]4f 14 core,
sums over m and n include 5d3/2, 5d5/2, 5f5/2, 5f7/2,
5g7/2, 5g9/2, and all states with principal quantum num-
ber n >5. We must, however, exclude terms with pairs
(mn) that are included in model space. Therefore, we re-
move the pairs (5d5d), (5d6s), and (6s6s) since they are
in the even-parity model space and pairs (5d6p), (5d5f ),
and (6s6p) in the odd-parity model space.

in Fig. 2b.

As an example, let us consider the singularity near
Z=85 in the curve describing the energy of the 6s2
level
The denominator in Eq. (A1)
is D = 2ǫ6s − ǫm − ǫn for the matrix element
Al(6s1/26s1/2; 6s1/26s1/2). For an ion with Z=85, D be-
comes very small when (mn)=(5d3/26d3/2) since ǫ6s1/2 =-
ǫ5d3/2=-12.069226 a.u., and ǫ6d3/2=-
9.488404 a.u.,
6.932272 a.u., giving D=0.02469. This one term dom-
inates the matrix element Al(6s1/26s1/2; 6s1/26s1/2) and
increases its size by a factor of six in comparison with
values for neighboring Z, explaining the singulatity at
Z=85 in Fig. 2b. The explanation of the sharp features
in the curves describing energies of the 6s1/26p1/2 and
5d5/25f5/2 levels in Fig. 3 is similar.

APPENDIX B: THE SECOND-ORDER DIPOLE
MATRIX ELEMENT

A typical contribution from one of the second-order
correlation corrections to the dipole matrix element
(vw(J) − v′w′(J ′) has the form [13]

Z (corr)[vw(J) − v′w′(J ′)] ∝ X

ZivXk(v′w′wi)
ǫi + ǫw − ǫv′ − ǫw′

,

i

where Ziv is a single-electron dipole matrix element. In
the sum over i, only terms with vanishing denominators
are excluded. For the 5d5/25d3/2(2) − 5d5/26p1/2(3) tran-
sition, we obtain
Z (corr)[5d5/25d3/2(2) − 5d5/26p1/2(1)]

Z(i, 5d5/2)Xk(5d5/26p1/2 5d3/2i)
ǫi + ǫ(5d3/2) − ǫ(5d5/2) − ǫ(6p1/2)

.

∝ X
i

For the case i=5f7/2 and Z=84, the denominator be-
comes

ǫi + ǫ(5d3/2) − ǫ(5d5/2) − ǫ(6p1/2) = 0.003.

This one term dominates the entire matrix element. For
the 5d5/25d5/2(0) − 5d3/26p1/2(1) transition, the denom-
inator becomes very small at Z=88 when i=5f7/2.
ǫi + ǫ(5d5/2) − ǫ(5d3/2) − ǫ(6p1/2) = −0.056.

Again, this single term dominates the matrix element.

A typical contributions from the second-order RPA
correction for dipole matrix element (vw(J) − v′w′(J ′)
has the form

In the case of b=5p3/2 and n=5d3/2 for nuclear charge
Z=88, the denominator becomes

ǫ(5d3/2) + ǫ(5d3/2) − ǫ(6p1/2) − ǫ(5p3/2) = −0.278.

where the index b designates core states and n des-
ignates an excited state. For the special case of the
5d5/25d3/2[2] − 6p1/25d5/2[1] transition, we obtain

As before, the small value of the denominator leads to
an anomalous increase in the size of the RPA matrix
element.

The low-lying n(=3,4,5)d 2D5/2 states alkaline earth ions are of vital importance in a number of
diﬀerent physical applications. The hyperﬁne structure constants of these states are characterized by
unusually strong electron correlation eﬀects. Relativistic coupled-cluster theory has been employed
to carry out ab initio calculations of these constants. The role of the all order core-polarization
eﬀects was found to be decisive in obtaining good agreement of the results of our calculations with
accurate measurements. The present work is an apt demonstration of the power of the coupled-
cluster method to cope with strongly interacting conﬁgurations.

PACS numbers:

The 2S1/2 → 2D5/2 transition frequencies in singly
ionized alkaline earth atoms are among the leading can-
didates in the search for an optical frequency standard
[1, 2, 3]. They are also of interest from the point of
view of quantum information processing [4], parity non-
conservation arising from the nuclear anapole moment
[5], and astrophysics [6]. A knowledge of the magnetic
dipole hyperﬁne structure constant (A) for the 2D5/2
states of these systems is essential for determining fre-
quency standards [7]. Hyperﬁne interactions in these
states are strongly inﬂuenced by electron correlation and
it is therefore of crucial importance to use a method that
can treat accurately the strongly interacting conﬁgura-
tions. The primary objective of this paper is to study
the peculiar trends in the electron correlation in the hy-
perﬁne interaction constants for the 2D5/2 states of the
singly ionized alkaline earth atoms using the relativistic
coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. This theory is equivalent
to all-order many-body perturbation theory [8, 9] and it
has the potential to take into account the interplay of rel-
ativistic and correlation eﬀects. It has been successfully
applied to understand the role of electron correlations in
s and p valence systems [10, 11, 12]. However, the ex-
cited 2D5/2 states of the alkaline earth ions are strongly
aﬀected by the core electrons. Systematic investigations
of the core-polarization (CP) eﬀects in these systems can
be carried out to obtain important insights into these
phenomena.

The A constant is given by [13]

where gI = [ µI
I ] is the nuclear Land´e g-factor with µI
and µN being the nuclear dipole moment Bohr magne-
ton, respectively. The single-particle expression for the
T operator is given elsewhere [13].

In RCC, the atomic wavefunction |Ψvi for a single va-

lence (v) open-shell system is given by [8, 14]

|Ψvi = eT {1 + Sv}|Φvi,

(0.2)

where |Φvi = a†
v|Φ0i, with |Φ0i being the Dirac-Fock
(DF) state for the closed-shell system. In the singles and
doubles approximation, we have

We use the Dirac-Coulomb atomic Hamiltonian for the
present calculations. We employ Gaussian type orbitals
(GTOs) to construct the DF wavefunction as explained
in [15]. Finite nuclei with Fermi charge distribution are
considered as given by Parpia and Mohanty [16]. All
core-electron eﬀects are considered in the DF and RCC
wavefunction calculations for all the systems.
In table
I, we present the total number of GTOs used for the
DF and active orbitals used for the RCC calculations in
diﬀerent systems. In table II, we present the gI values
that are used to calculate A for various systems.

The terms involving OS2v in the expansion of Eqn. 0.5
represents the all order CP eﬀect. One could, therefore,

consider OS2v as an all order dressed CP eﬀect and di-
agrams associated with them are given in Fig. 1.
In
order to highlight the spectacular role of the CP eﬀects,
we present the DF and OS2v contributions along with
the experimental results of A for diﬀerent states in table
III. It is obvious from this table that the DF and exper-
imental results have opposite signs except for Ca+. The
contributions from OS2v are larger than the DF values for
all the ions except Be+ which has only one core-orbital.
Their inclusion signiﬁcantly improves the agreement of
A with the experimental values for all the ions.

A deeper understanding of these results can be ob-
tained from table IV, where we have given the all order
CP contribution to A from diﬀerent core (a) and virtual
(p) orbitals. It is clear from this table that the valence
or the low-lying continuum orbitals and the outer core
orbitals contribute more than the other orbitals. The
signiﬁcant contributions due to the valence orbitals arise
from the large size of the hyperﬁne matrix elements and
the small energy diﬀerences involving the valence and the

outer core orbitals. Even though the high-lying (s and p)
continuum orbitals have a large density at the nucleus,
their contributions are small. Their energies are rather
large compare to the core orbitals and this makes their
contributions to A almost insigniﬁcant.

From Eqn. 0.1, it is clear that A depends on both the
nuclear Land´e g-factor (gI ) and the matrix element of the
T operator which depends on the electron wavefunctions.
It would, therefore, be appropriate to study the variation
in electron correlation in diﬀerent systems by examining
the results of A/gI.

The CP eﬀects arising from diﬀerent systems for the
low-lying 2D5/2 states are presented in Fig. 2 by plot-
ting the ratio of the contributions of OS2v with the cor-

responding gI. These contributions have negative signs
and they are very pronounced in heavier systems.

In table V, we give the results of our RCC calculations
for the ﬁnal values of A as well as those of other calcula-
tions and measurements wherever available. In order to
appreciate the relative importance of the diﬀerent phys-
ical eﬀects, we plot their fractional contributions in Fig.
3 for all the ions. The role played by the diﬀerent physi-
cal eﬀects is evident from this ﬁgure. The overall trends
exhibited by A for the 2D5/2 states of the alkaline earth
ions are indeed very peculiar compare to single d- valence
neutral atoms [11] and also single s and p valence atomic
systems [10, 12]. This peculiarity can undoubtedly be
attributed to the overwhelming contributions of the CP
eﬀects to the hyperﬁne constants of the states that we

have investigated.

Our results are considerable improvements over those
of previous calculations which were performed by diﬀer-
ent variants of many-body perturbation theories except
the latest which are based on relativistic conﬁguration
interaction (RCI) method [26]. The RCI calculations by
Itano use a multi-conﬁguration DF extended optimized

4

level (MCDF-EOL) single particle basis. He considers
only a subset of the single and double excitations used
in our calculations and the core excitations are limited
only to a few outer core electrons. Also, he has excluded
the non-linear terms present in our RCC wavefunctions
given in Eqn. 0.2. For Sr+ and Ba+, the RCI calculations
give wrong signs for A (see table V), thereby highlighting
the extraordinarily strong correlation eﬀects in these two
systems.

Our present work on the magnetic dipole hyperﬁne
structure constants of the 2D5/2 states of the alkaline
earth ions is a testament to the remarkable ability of the
relativistic coupled-cluster theory to successfully capture
very strong correlation eﬀects even when other widely
used methods like the ﬁnite order relativistic many-body
perturbation theory and the relativistic conﬁguration in-
teraction fail. This feature, if suitably exploited, can
yield a wealth of very useful information about a wide
range of the atomic properties.

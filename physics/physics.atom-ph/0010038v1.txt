The divergent perturbation series for the LoSurdo–Stark eﬀect has purely real coeﬃcients. By
contrast, the energy eigenvalue of the quasistationary states is complex (the imaginary part corre-
sponds to the autoionization width). Two resummation prescriptions are compared: (i) a contour-
improved resummation method based on a combination of Borel and Pad´e techniques and (ii) a
combination of the Borel method with an analytic continuation by conformal mapping. With both
methods, the complex energy eigenvalue can be reconstructed from the purely real perturbation
series. The performance of both methods is compared, calculational diﬃculties at strong ﬁeld are
addressed, and the connection to divergent perturbative expansions in quantum ﬁeld theory is dis-
cussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Rayleigh–Schr¨odinger perturbation series for the
LoSurdo–Stark eﬀect [1,2] can be formulated to arbitrar-
ily high order [3]. The perturbative coeﬃcients grow fac-
torially in absolute magnitude [4], and the radius of con-
vergence of the perturbation series about the origin is
zero. The perturbation series is a divergent, asymptotic
expansion in the electric ﬁeld strength F , i.e. about zero
electric ﬁeld. This means that the perturbative terms at
small coupling ﬁrst decrease in absolute magnitude up to
some minimal term. After passing through the minimal
term, the perturbative terms increase again in magni-
tude, and the series ultimately diverges.

By the use of a resummation method, it is possible
to assign a ﬁnite value to an otherwise divergent se-
ries, and various applications of resummation methods in
mathematics and physics have been given, e.g., in [5–9].
For a general introduction to divergent series we refer
to [10–19]. When a divergent series is resummed, the su-
perﬁcial precision limit set by the minimal term can be
overcome, and more accurate results can be obtained as
compared to the optimal truncation of the perturbation
series [20].

In [21] it was shown that the convergence of Rayleigh-
Schr¨odinger perturbation theory can be improved if (di-
agonal) Pad´e approximants to the divergent perturbation
series are evaluated instead of the “raw” partial sums of
the divergent perturbation series (see Table I in [21]).
However, the Pad´e approximants cannot reproduce the
full physical result. The rational approximants produce
real output if the (purely real) perturbative coeﬃcients
of the Stark eﬀect are used as input data. The imaginary
part of the complex energy pseudoeigenvalue, which cor-
responds to the autoionization width, is not reproduced.
The divergent perturbation series of the LoSurdo–
Stark eﬀect has both alternating and nonalternating com-
ponents (as explained in Sec. II below). Rather signiﬁ-

cant diﬀerences exist between the resummation of nonal-
ternating divergent perturbation series (i.e., series whose
terms have the same sign) and alternating divergent per-
turbation series (i.e., series whose terms alternate in
sign). Typically, nonalternating series describe “unsta-
ble” physical situations in which the energy eigenvalues
acquire an imaginary component. An example for a non-
alternating divergent series is the quartic anharmonic os-
cillator at negative coupling (the perturbation is of the
form g x4 where g is the coupling). The perturbative co-
eﬃcients for the anharmonic oscillator grow factorially
and alternate in sign [22–29]. The energy levels of the
quartic anharmonic oscillator acquire a width when the
coupling parameter becomes negative (g < 0). This sce-
nario is equivalent to a nonalternating perturbation series
at positive coupling. The energy eigenvalue of the quar-
tic anharmonic oscillator as a function of the coupling
parameter has a branch cut along the negative real axis
(see Ch. 37 of [30]). The resummation of nonalternat-
ing series or of series which have a leading or subleading
nonalternating component, therefore corresponds to a re-
summation “on the cut” in the complex plane. Histori-
cally, the resummation of divergent series with nonalter-
nating contributions has been problematic [5,6]. Here, we
show that the divergent perturbation series of the Stark
eﬀect can be resummed by a combination of Borel [10]
and Pad´e [5,7] techniques, where the Pad´e approximants
are used for the analytic continuation of the partial sums
of the Borel transform beyond the circle of convergence.
The ﬁnal evaluation of the Laplace–Borel integral is car-
ried out along an integration contour introduced in [20].

The LoSurdo–Stark eﬀect and in particular the de-
cay width, which is nonperturbative and nonanalytic
in the electric ﬁeld, have attracted considerable atten-
tion [3,4,21,31–61]. Experiments have been performed
in ﬁeld strengths up to a couple of MV/cm [62–65]. A
rather mathematically motivated investigation regarding
the Borel summability of the divergent perturbation se-

1

ries for the LoSurdo–Stark eﬀect was performed in [39].
Mathematical considerations on the Borel summability
in general imply a priori that the Borel transform can
be analytically continued beyond its ﬁnite radius of con-
vergence. The problem of how this analytic continua-
tion of the Borel transform can be constructed from a
ﬁnite number of perturbative terms, is not considered.
Also, it should be noted that the investigation [39] is
restricted to nonreal, unphysical electric ﬁeld strengths
0 < arg F < π. The result for a physically relevant,
real ﬁeld strength F requires an additional analytic con-
tinuation. The calculation [52] showed that it is pos-
sible to perform the analytic continuation of the Borel
transform by employing Pad´e approximants.
In com-
parison to the investigation [52], we use here a slightly
modiﬁed, but equivalent integration contour for the eval-
uation of the generalized Borel integral (see [20] and
Sec. III below). This contour exhibits the additional
terms which have to be added to the otherwise recom-
mended principal-value prescription [66–68]. The inte-
gration oﬀ the real axis serves to reproduce the full phys-
ical result for the energy level (including the width of the
quasistationary state). Our calculation extends to higher
ﬁeld strengths than [52], and we also investigate an ex-
cited state, whereas the previous work [52] was restricted
to the ground state.

The alternative resummation method discussed here
makes use of a conformal mapping of
the Borel
plane [67–73] and leads to results consistent with the
method indicated above. The application of the confor-
mal mapping depends on further information about the
perturbation series. As explained in Sec. IV below, we de-
termine the radius of convergence of the Borel transform
by analyzing the large-order growth of the perturbative
coeﬃcients. Moreover, we calculate the branch points in
the Borel plane. These results make possible the appli-
cation of the conformal mapping for the analytic con-
tinuation of the Borel transform. The resummation of
the perturbative expansion can then be accomplished by
evaluating a generalized Laplace–Borel integral.

This paper is organized as follows:

In Sec. II, we
give a brief outline of the perturbative expansion for the
LoSurdo–Stark eﬀect. In Secs. III and IV, we describe
the resummation methods which are used to obtain the
numerical results presented in Sec. V. We conclude with
a summary of the results in Sec. VI. Finally, the connec-
tion of the current investigation to quantum ﬁeld theo-
retic perturbation series and a number of recent investi-
gations in this area is brieﬂy discussed in Appendix VI.

II. PERTURBATION SERIES FOR THE

LoSURDO–STARK EFFECT

In the presence of an electric ﬁeld, the SO(4) symmetry
of the hydrogen atom is broken, and parabolic quantum
numbers n1, n2 and m are used for the classiﬁcation of

the atomic states [74]. For the Stark eﬀect, the pertur-
bative expansion of the energy eigenvalue E(n1, n2, m, F )
reads [see Eq. (59) of [3]],

E(n1, n2, m, F ) ∼

∞

XN =0

E(N )

n1n2m F N ,

(1)

where F is the electric ﬁeld strength. For N → ∞, the
leading large-order factorial asymptotics of the perturba-
tive coeﬃcients have been derived in [43] as

E(N )
n1n2m ∼ A(N )

n1n2m + (−1)N A(N )

n2n1m , N → ∞ ,

(2)

where A(N )

ninj m is given as an asymptotic series,

A(N )
ninj m ∼ K(ni, nj, m, N )

∞

aninj m

k

Xk=0
where the aninj m
Eq. (3) are given by

k

(2 nj + m + N − k)! .

(3)

are constants. The K-coeﬃcients in

K(ni, nj, m, N ) = −(cid:2)2πn3nj! (nj + m)!(cid:3)
× exp{3 (ni − nj)} 62 nj +m+1 (3n3/2)N .

−1

(4)

Here, the principal quantum number n as a function of
the parabolic quantum numbers n1, n2 and m is given
by [see Eq. (65) in [3]]

n = n1 + n2 + |m| + 1 .

(5)

According to Eq. (2),
the perturbative coeﬃcients
E(N )
n1n2m, for large order N → ∞ of perturbation theory,
can be written as a sum of a nonalternating factorially di-
vergent series [ﬁrst term in Eq. (2)] and of an alternating
factorially divergent series [second term in Eq. (2)]. Be-
cause the aninj m
in Eq. (3) are multiplied by the factorial
(2 ni + m + N − k)!, we infer that for large perturbation
theory order N , the term related to the aninj m
coeﬃcient
(k = 0) dominates. Terms with k ≥ 1 are suppressed in
relation to the leading term by a relative factor of 1/N k
according to the asymptotics

0

k

(2 nj + m + N − k)!

(2 nj + m + N )! ∼

1

N k (cid:20)1 + O(cid:18) 1

N(cid:19)(cid:21)

(6)

for N → ∞. The leading (k = 0)–coeﬃcient has been
evaluated in [4] as

aninj m
0

= 1 .

(7)

According to Eqs. (2), (3) and (7), for states with n1 <
n2, the nonalternating component of the perturbation
series dominates in large order of perturbation theory,
whereas for states with n1 > n2, the alternating compo-
nent is dominant as N → ∞. For states with n1 = n2,
the odd-N perturbative coeﬃcients vanish [43], and the

2

even-N coeﬃcients necessarily have the same sign in large
order [see Eq. (2)]. According to Eq. (2), there are sub-
leading divergent nonalternating contributions for states
with n1 > n2, and there exist subleading divergent al-
ternating contributions for states with n1 < n2. This
complicates the resummation of the perturbation series.

[see e.g. Eqs. (8.2.3) and (8.2.4) of [5]]. It has been sug-
gested in [66] that the analytic continuation of (9) into
regions where F retains a nonvanishing, albeit inﬁnitesi-
mal, imaginary part can be achieved by evaluating Pad´e
approximants. Using the ﬁrst M + 1 terms in the power
expansion of the Borel transform EB(z), we construct the
Pad´e approximant (we follow the notation of [7])

FIG. 1.

Integration contour C+1 for the evaluation of
the generalized Borel integral deﬁned in Eq. (11). Poles
displaced from the real axis are evaluated as full poles,
whereas those poles which lie on the real axis are treated
as half poles.

III. RESUMMATION BY BOREL–PAD ´E

TECHNIQUES

The resummation of the perturbation series (1) by a
combination of the Borel transformation and Pad´e ap-
proximants proceeds as follows. First we deﬁne the pa-
rameter

λ = 2 max(n1, n2) + m + 1 .

(8)

The large-order growth of the perturbative coeﬃcients
[see Eqs. (2) and (3)] suggests the deﬁnition of the (gen-
eralized) Borel transform [see Eq. (4) in [76]]

EB(z) ≡ EB(n1, n2, m, z)

∞

= B(1,λ) [E(n1, n2, m); z]
XN =0

E(N )
n1n2m
Γ(N + λ)

zN ,

=

(9)

where we consider the argument z of EB(z) as a complex
variable. Because the perturbative coeﬃcients E(N )
n1n2m
diverge factorially in absolute magnitude, the Borel
transform EB(z) has a ﬁnite radius of convergence about
the origin. The evaluation of the (generalized) Laplace–
Borel integral [see Eq. (11) below] therefore requires an
analytic continuation of EB(z) beyond the radius of con-
vergence. The “classical” Borel integral is performed in
the z-range z ∈ (0,∞), i.e. along the positive real axis

3

where [[x]] denotes the largest positive integer smaller
than x. We then evaluate the (modiﬁed) Borel integral
along the integration contour C+1 shown in Fig. 1 in or-
der to construct the transform TEM (F ) where
dt tλ−1 exp(−t)PM (F t) .

TEM (F ) = ZC+1

(11)

The successive evaluation of transforms TEM (F ) in in-
creasing transformation order M is performed, and the
apparent convergence of the transforms is examined.
This procedure is illustrated in Tables I and II of [20].
In the current evaluation, a slightly modiﬁed scheme is
used for selecting the poles in the upper right quadrant
of the complex plane as compared to [20].

The contour C+1 is supposed to encircle all poles at
t = zi in the upper right quadrant of the complex plane
with arg zi < π/4 in the mathematically negative sense.
That is to say, the contribution of all poles zi with
Rezi > 0, Imzi > 0 and Rezi > Imzi,

−2 π i Xi

Res
t=zi

tλ−1 exp(−t)PM (F t) ,

is added to the principal value (P.V.) of the integral (11)
carried out in the range t ∈ (0,∞). Note the further
restriction (Imzi < Rezi or equivalently arg zi < π/4)
with regard to the selection of poles in comparison to
the previous investigation [20]. In practical calculations,
this modiﬁcation is observed not to aﬀect the numerical
values of the transforms TEM (F ) deﬁned in Eq. (11) in
higher transformation order M ≥ 10 [i.e. for large M , see
also Eq. (14) below], because the poles are observed to
cluster near the real axis in higher transformation order,
and so the contribution of poles with π/4 < arg zi < π/2
gradually vanishes. We have,

TEM (F ) = (P.V.)Z ∞
−2 π i Xi

Res
t=zi

0

dt tλ−1 exp(−t)PM (F t)

tλ−1 exp(−t)PM (F t) .

(12)

The principal-value prescription [ﬁrst term in Eq. (12)]
for the evaluation of the Laplace–Borel integral has been
recommended in [66,75]. This prescription leads to a
real (rather than complex) result for the energy shift
and cannot account for the width of the quasistationary

state. The additional pole contributions [second term in
Eq. (12)] are responsible for complex-valued (imaginary)
corrections which lead, in particular, to the decay width.
By contour integration (Cauchy Theorem) and Jor-
dan’s Lemma, one can show that the result obtained
along C+1 is equivalent to an integration along the
straight line with arg z = π/4,

TEM (F ) = cλ Z ∞

0

dt tλ−1 exp(−c t)PM (F c t)

(13)

where c = exp(i π/4). This contour has been used in [52]
(see also p. 815 in [30]). The exponential factor exp(−c t)
and the asymptotic behavior of the Pad´e approximant
PM (F c t) as t → ∞ together ensure that the integrand
falls oﬀ suﬃciently rapidly so that the Cauchy Theorem
and Jordan’s Lemma can be applied to show the equiva-
lence of the representations (12) and (13).

The representation (13) illustrates the fact that the
integration in the complex plane along C+1 analytically
continues the resummed result in those cases where the
evaluation of the standard Laplace–Borel integral is not
feasible due to poles on the real axis. The representations
(11) and (12) serve to clarify the role of the additional
terms which have to be added to the result obtained by
the principal-value prescription in order to obtain the
full physical result, including the nonperturbative, non-
analytic contributions. Note that, as stressed in [20],
the pole contributions in general do not only modify the
imaginary, but also the real part of the resummed value
for the perturbation series.

Formally, the limit of the sequence of the TEM (F ) as
M → ∞, provided it exists, yields the nonperturbative
result inferred from the perturbative expansion (1),

lim
M→∞ TEM (F ) = E(F ) ≡ E(n1, n2, m, F ) .

(14)

Because the contour C+1 shown in Fig. 1 extends into
the complex plane, the transforms TEM (F ) acquire an
imaginary part even though the perturbative coeﬃcients
in Eq. (1) are real.

In the context of numerical analysis, the concept of
incredulity [77] may be used for the analysis of the con-
vergence of the transforms TEM (F ) of increasing order
M .
If a certain number of subsequent transforms ex-
hibit apparent numerical convergence within a speciﬁed
relative accuracy, then the calculation of transforms is
stopped, and the result of the last calculated transfor-
mation is taken as the numerical limit of the series under
investigation.
It has been observed in [20,66] that for
a number of physically relevant perturbation series, the
apparent numerical convergence of the transforms (11),
with increasing transformation order, leads to the phys-
ically correct results. Note that in [66], speciﬁc pertur-
bation series were examined for which the second term
in (12) vanishes.

The resummation method by a combination of Borel
and Pad´e techniques, which has been introduced in

the current Section, will be referred to as “method I”
throughout the current paper.

IV. RESUMMATION BY CONFORMAL

MAPPING

According to Eqs. (2) and (3), the perturbative coeﬃ-
cient E(N )
n1n2m, for large N , can be written as the sum of
an alternating and of a nonalternating divergent series.
In view of Eqs. (4) and (7), we conclude that the series
deﬁned in Eq. (9),

EB(z) =

∞

XN =0

E(N )
n1n2m
Γ(N + λ)

zN ,

has a radius of convergence

s =

2

3 n3

(15)

about the origin, where n is the principal quantum num-
ber [see Eq. (5)]. Therefore, the function

EB(w) =

∞

XN =0

E(N )
n1n2m sN
Γ(N + λ)

wN ,

(16)

has a unit radius of convergence about the origin. It is not
a priori obvious if the points w = −1 and w = +1 repre-
sent isolated singularities or branch points. The asymp-
totic properties (2) and (3) together with Eq. (6) suggest
that the points w = −1 and w = +1 do not constitute
poles of ﬁnite order. We observe that the leading facto-
rial growth of the perturbative coeﬃcients in large per-
turbation order N is divided out in the Borel transform
(16), which is a sum over N . The perturbative coeﬃ-
cient E(N )
n1n2m can be written as an asymptotic series over
k [see Eq. (3)]. We interchange the order of the summa-
tions over N and k, we use Eq. (6) and take advantage
of the identity

∞

XN =0

wk
N k = Lik(w) .

The Borel transform EB(w) can then be written as a sum
over terms of the form Tk(w) where for k → ∞,

Tk(w) ∼ C(ni, nj, m) aninj m

k

Lik(w) .

(17)

The coeﬃcient C(ni, nj, m) is given by

C(ni, nj, m) = −(cid:2)2πn3nj! (nj + m)!(cid:3)
× exp{3 (ni − nj)} 62 nj +m+1 .

−1

(18)

These considerations suggest that the points w = −1
and w = +1 represent essential singularities (in this case,
branch points) of the Borel transform EB(w) deﬁned in

4

Eq. (16). For the analytic continuation of EB(w) by con-
formal mapping, we write w as

w =

2 y

1 + y2

(19)

(this conformal mapping preserves the origin of the com-
plex plane). Here, we refer to w as the Borel variable,
and we call y the conformal variable. We then express
the M th partial sum of (16) as

E M
B (w) =

M

XN =0

E(N )
n1n2m sN
Γ(N + λ)

wN

=

M

XN =0

CN yN + O(yM+1) ,

(20)

where the coeﬃcients CN are uniquely determined [see,
e.g., Eqs. (36) and (37) of [67]]. We deﬁne the partial
sum of the Borel transform, re-expanded in terms of the
conformal variable y, as

E ′M
B (y) =

M

XN =0

CN yN .

(21)

We then evaluate (lower-diagonal) Pad´e approximants to
the function E ′M

B (y),

B (y) = (cid:20)[[M/2]](cid:30)[[(M + 1)/2]](cid:21)E ′M
E ′′M

(y) .

B

(22)

We deﬁne the following transforms,

T ′′EM (F ) = sλ ZC+1

dw wλ−1 exp(cid:0)−w(cid:1)E ′′M

B (cid:0)y(w)(cid:1) .

(23)

At increasing M , the limit as M → ∞, provided it ex-
ists, is then again assumed to represent the complete,
physically relevant solution,

E(F ) = lim

M→∞ T ′′EM (F ) .

(24)

We do not consider the question of the existence of this
limit here (for an outline of questions related to these
issues we refer to [68]).

Inverting Eq. (19) yields [see Eq. (23)]

y(w) =

√1 + w − √1 − w
√1 + w + √1 − w

.

(25)

The conformal mapping given by Eqs. (19) and (25) maps
the doubly cut w-plane with cuts running from w = 1 to
w = ∞ and w = −1 to w = −∞ unto the unit circle in
the complex y-plane. The cuts themselves are mapped
to the edge of the unit circle in the y-plane.

5

In comparison to the investigations [67] and [68],
we use here a diﬀerent conformal mapping deﬁned in
Eqs. (19) and (25) which reﬂects the diﬀerent singular-
ity structure in the complex plane [cf. Eq. (27) in [67]].
We also mention the application of Pad´e approximants
for the numerical improvement of the conformal map-
ping performed according to Eq. (22). In comparison to
a recent investigation [73], where the additional Pad´e–
improvement in the conformal variable is also used, we
perform here the analytic continuation by a mapping
whose structure reﬂects the double cuts suggested by
the asymptotic properties of the perturbative coeﬃcients
given in Eqs. (2), (3) and (6) [cf. Eq. (5) in [73]].

The method introduced in this Section will be referred
to as “method II”. It is one of the motivations for the
current investigation to contrast and compare the two
methods I and II. A comparison of diﬀerent approaches
to the resummation problem for series with both alter-
nating and nonalternating divergent components appears
useful, in part because the conformal mapping (without
further Pad´e improvement) has been recommended for
the resummation of quantum chromodynamic perturba-
tion series [67,68].

We do not

consider order-dependent mappings
here [69–72]. For an order-dependent mapping to be con-
structed, the conformal mapping in Eq. (19) has to be
modiﬁed, and a free parameter ρ has to be introduced.
The coeﬃcients CN in the accordingly modiﬁed Eq. (21)
then become ρ-dependent. The free parameter ρ is cho-
sen so that the ρ-dependent coeﬃcient CM (ρ) of order M
vanishes. Consequently, the choice of ρ depends on the
order M of perturbation theory, and in this way the map-
ping becomes order-dependent. Certain complications
arise because ρ cannot be chosen arbitrarily, but has to
be selected, roughly speaking, as the ﬁrst zero of the ρ-
dependent coeﬃcient CM (ρ) for which the absolute mag-
nitude of the derivative C ′
M (ρ) is small (this is explained
in [30], p. 886). It is conceivable that with a judicious
choice of ρ, further acceleration of the convergence can
be achieved, especially when the order-dependent map-
ping is combined with a Pad´e approximation as it is done
here in Eq. (22) with our order-independent mapping. In
the current investigation, we restrict the discussion to
the conformal order-independent mapping (19) which is
nevertheless optimal in the sense discussed in [67,68].

V. NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS

In this section, the numerical results based on the re-
summation methods introduced in Secs. III and IV are
presented. Before we describe the calculation in detail,
we should note that relativistic corrections to both the
real and the imaginary part of the energy contribute at
a relative order of (Zα)2 compared to the leading non-
relativistic eﬀect which is treated in the current inves-
tigation (and in the previous work on the subject, see

e.g. [43,52]). Therefore, the theoretical uncertainty due
to relativistic eﬀects can be estimated to be, at best, 1
part in 104 (for an outline of the relativistic and quan-
tum electrodynamic corrections in hydrogen see [78–84]).
Measurements in very high ﬁelds are diﬃcult [62]. At the
achievable ﬁeld strengths to date (less than 0.001 a.u. or
about 5 MV/cm), the accuracy of the theoretical predic-
tion exceeds the experimental precision, and relativistic
eﬀects do not need to be taken into account.

The perturbative coeﬃcients E(N )

n1n2m deﬁned in Eq. (1)

for the energy shift can be inferred, to arbitrarily high or-
der, from the Eqs. (9), (13–15), (28–33), (59–67) and (73)
in [3]. The atomic unit system is used in the sequel, as is
customary for this type of calculation [3,33,36,38]. The
unit of energy is α2 me c2 = 27.211 eV where α is the
ﬁne structure constant, and the unit of the electric ﬁeld
is the ﬁeld strength felt by an electron at a distance of
one Bohr radius aBohr to a nucleus of elementary charge,
Bohr) = 5.142× 103 MV/cm (here,
which is 1/(4 π ǫ0) (e/a2
ǫ0 is the permittivity of the vacuum).

(parabolic quantum numbers n1 = 0, n2 = 0, m = 0). The ﬁeld strength F is given in atomic units. A comparison is made to
the earlier work [36]. Discrepancies at large ﬁeld in comparison to the investigation [36] have also been found in [46,51,54].

We consider the resummation of the divergent pertur-
bative expansion (1) for two states of atomic hydrogen.
These are the ground state (n1 = n2 = m = 0) and an
excited state with parabolic quantum numbers n1 = 3,
n2 = 0, m = 1 [note Eq. (5)]. We list here the ﬁrst few
perturbative coeﬃcients for the states under investiga-
tion. For the ground state, we have (in atomic units),

The perturbation series for the state n1 = 3, n2 = 0,
m = 1 is alternating, but has a subleading nonalternat-
ing component [see Eq. (2)]. The ﬁrst perturbative terms

Note that for F = 0, the unperturbed nonrelativistic en-
ergy is recovered, which is −1/(2 n2) in atomic units. In
contrast to the real perturbative coeﬃcients, the energy

6

pseudoeigenvalue (resonance) E(n1, n2, m, F ) has a real
and an imaginary component,

i

Γn1n2m(F ) , (28)

where Γn1n2m(F ) is the autoionization width.

Using the computer algebra system Mathemat-
ica [85,86], the perturbative coeﬃcients in the expansion
of the energy (1) are evaluated up to N = 40. This makes
possible the evaluation of the transforms TEM (F ) de-
ﬁned in Eq. (11) up to the transformation order M = 40.
The apparent convergence of the transforms in higher or-
der is examined. This procedure leads to the numerical
results listed in Tables I and II. The numerical error
of our results is estimated by determining the numerical
variation (highest and lowest value) of the four highest-
order transforms M = 37, 38, 39, 40.
It is conceivable
that more accurate numerical results could be obtained
by evaluating higher-order transforms of order M > 40.
An important result of the comparison of the meth-
ods introduced in Secs. III and IV is the following:
Both methods appear to accomplish a resummation of
the perturbation series to the physically correct result.
Method II (Borel+Pad´e-improved conformal mapping,
see Sec. IV) appears to perform marginally better than
method I (plain Borel+Pad´e, see Sec. III). Both methods
yield approximately the same number of signiﬁcant ﬁg-
ures in the ﬁnal result. For the perturbation series stud-
ied in [73], considerable improvement was achieved by
employing a variant of method II as compared to method
I applied to the very problem studied in [73] (roughly
two more signiﬁcant ﬁgures were obtained with method
II than with method I). In all cases considered (here and
in [73]), both methods I and II lead to results which are
in mutual agreement. To date, a rigorous theory of the
performance of the resummation methods for divergent
series of the type discussed in this work (with alternating
and nonalternating components) does not exist.

In order to illustrate the above statements, we con-
sider, for the atomic state with quantum numbers n1 = 3,
n2 = 0 and m = 1, the evaluation of the transforms
TEM (F ) deﬁned in Eq. (11) (method I) and of the trans-
forms T ′′EM (F ) deﬁned in Eq. (23) (method II) in trans-
formation order M = 38, 39, 40 for a ﬁeld strength of
F = 2.1393 × 10−4. Method II leads to the following
results,

T ′′E37(F = 2.1393 × 10−4) = −0.015 860 468 42

−0.529 32 × 10−6 ,

T ′′E38(F = 2.1393 × 10−4) = −0.015 860 468 39

−0.529 11 × 10−6 ,

T ′′E39(F = 2.1393 × 10−4) = −0.015 860 468 37
and

−0.529 11 × 10−6

7

T ′′E40(F = 2.1393 × 10−4) = −0.015 860 468 39

−0.529 09 × 10−6 .

Here, we should note one important point: The addi-
tional Pad´e–improvement of method II signiﬁcantly im-
proves the convergence. If the plain conformal mapping
is used, i.e. if the evaluation of the Pad´e approximants
in Eq. (22) is left out and the partial sum expressed in
terms of the conformal variable (21) is directly plugged
into the integral (23), then the numerical accuracy dete-
riorates. In this case, the real part of the 39th and the
40th transform read −0.015 860 424 and −0.015 860 616,
respectively, which corresponds to 5 less signiﬁcant ﬁg-
ures in the ﬁnal result than achievable by method II.
Method I yields the following data,

TE37(F = 2.1393 × 10−4) = −0.015 860 468 41

−0.529 25 × 10−6 ,

TE38(F = 2.1393 × 10−4) = −0.015 860 468 43

−0.529 18 × 10−6 ,

TE39(F = 2.1393 × 10−4) = −0.015 860 468 28
and

−0.529 31 × 10−6

TE40(F = 2.1393 × 10−4) = −0.015 860 468 32

−0.529 13 × 10−6 .

Numerical results obtained by resummation are pre-
sented in Tables I and II for a variety of ﬁeld strengths
and for the two atomic states under investigation here.
At large ﬁeld, the numerical evaluation of the pseu-
doeigenvalues has been historically problematic. Follow-
ing early work [32,33,35], the numerical results of [36] ap-
pear to have been taken as a reference point for a number
of subsequent calculations.
In [3], results are obtained
by optimal truncation of the perturbative expansion (see
Table VII of [3]). These results are real rather than com-
plex. This restriction is shared by methods which are
based on the direct application of Pad´e approximants to
the perturbation series, as pointed out in Sec. I (see also
Ref. [21]). Such an approach can only lead to better ap-
proximants for the real part of the energy.

The fact that the numerical calculation [36] is inaccu-
rate at large ﬁeld has been indicated explicitly in [51].
The calculation [51] yields improved accuracy for the
ground state at large ﬁeld. However, e.g. for the excited
state with quantum numbers n1 = 3, n2 = 0 and m = 1,
the numerical precision of the calculation [51] has not
been suﬃcient to discern any numerical discrepancy with
the previous calculation [36] (see Table III in [51]). Very
accurate data for the ground state, even at large ﬁeld,
have also been obtained in the investigation [46], which
is based on a complex coordinate approach. Our data are
consistent with the results of [46]. The calculation [46] is

restricted to the ground state. Another investigation [50],
based on complex coordinates, has lead to very accurate
data for the ground state; ﬁeld strengths of F ≤ 0.1 in

atomic units are considered. In [52] (generalized Borel–
Pad´e resummation), numerical data are obtained for the
ground state, again for ﬁeld strengths F ≤ 0.1.

the ground state, discrepancies are observed at large ﬁeld.

The numerical calculation [36], while leading to inac-
curate results for excessively large electric ﬁelds, yields
very accurate data for all experimentally accessible elec-
tric ﬁeld strengths to date. In addition, it should be no-
ticed that the inaccuracies at excessively large ﬁeld of [36]
have been pointed out by the same authors in [54]. How-
ever, not all atomic states considered in [36] were treated
in the later investigation [54]. Our data for the ground
state indicated in Table I are consistent with the numer-
ical results obtained in [54]. However, it should be noted
that the later work [54] leaves out the excited state with
quantum numbers n1 = 3, n2 = 0 and m = 1 for which
results are given here here in Table II. To the best of our
knowledge, the numerical discrepancy with [36] for the
excited state with quantum numbers n1 = 3, n2 = 0 and
m = 1 has not been recorded in the literature. We do
not claim here that it would have been impossible to dis-
cern this discrepancy with the other methods which have
been devised for the theoretical LoSurdo–Stark problem.
Notably, it appears likely that the approach from [54] or
the method presented in [46] could easily be generalized
to the particular excited state considered here, and that
such a generalization would lead to very accurate results.
We merely include Table II here in order to illustrate the
utility of the rather unconventional resummation method
for the regime of large coupling, where even rather sophis-
ticated numerical methods, which avoid the intricacies of
a small-ﬁeld perturbative expansion, have been shown to
be problematic [36,54]. We conﬁrm that the numerical
data given in [36] are accurate up to a ﬁeld strength of
F ≈ 0.1 for the ground state and up to F ≈ 3 × 10−4

for the excited (n = 5)-state with n1 = 3, n2 = 0 and
m = 1.

In order to exemplify the utility of a resummation
method in comparison to the pure perturbation series,
we brieﬂy consider here the ground state for a relatively
large ﬁeld F = 0.40. In this case, the ﬁrst partial sums
of the perturbation series (26) read

−0.5,−0.86,−2.282,−22.3842, . . .

This divergent sequence of numbers illustrates that at
large coupling, the perturbation series becomes entirely
meaningless unless it is combined with a suitable resum-
mation process.

VI. CONCLUSION

The quasistationary states of hydrogenlike atoms in
an electric background ﬁeld have been investigated using
the perturbative approach in [3,43]. We would also like to
mention a recent investigation where allowance is made
for polynomial potentials in contrast to the constant elec-
tric ﬁeld which leads to a linear potential [61]. These in-
vestigations are complemented by approaches which com-
bine the perturbative series with resummation methods,
as it is done in [21,52] and in the current investigation.

Here, we discuss the resummation of the divergent per-
turbation series of the LoSurdo–Stark eﬀect using two
methods. Method I, which uses a variant of the contour-
improved Borel–Pad´e technique introduced in [52], is de-
scribed in Sec. III. The integration contour is modiﬁed so

8

that the additional terms which have to be added to the
principal value of the Laplace–Borel integral are clearly
identiﬁed [see Eq. (12)]. Method II, which comprises an
analytic continuation by conformal mapping with addi-
tional improvement by Pad´e approximants in the confor-
mal variable [see Eq. (22)], is discussed in Sec. IV. This
method is a variant of the method introduced in [67,68]
which has been shown to accelerate convergence of per-
turbative quantum chromodynamics (by optimal confor-
mal mapping of the Borel plane). Both methods accom-
plish a resummation of the divergent perturbation series
(1) for the LoSurdo–Stark eﬀect, and the decay width of
the quasistationary states is obtained (see Sec. V and the
numerical results in Tables I and II).

It is a characteristic feature of the quasistationary
states in an electric ﬁeld that nonperturbative, nonan-
alytic imaginary contributions exist which correspond to
the autoionization decay width [see Eq. (28)]. These
contributions cannot be accounted for by perturba-
tion theory (the coeﬃcients are real rather than com-
plex), unless the perturbation series is combined with
a resummation process.
In quantum electrodynamics,
we encounter nonperturbative eﬀects in the electron-
positron pair-production amplitude in a background elec-
tric ﬁeld [87–90]. The vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude ac-
quires an imaginary part, whose magnitude is related to
the production rate per space-time volume of fermion-
antifermion pairs. This nonperturbative, imaginary con-
tribution can be inferred from the perturbative expan-
sion of the eﬀective action by contour-improved resum-
mation [20]. Nonperturbative eﬀects typically involve a
nonanalytic factor of exp(−1/g) where g is an appro-
priate coupling parameter for the physical system under
investigation (in the case of the LoSurdo–Stark eﬀect,
the coupling parameter is the electric ﬁeld strength F ).
The existence of nonperturbative contributions is inti-
mately linked with the failure of the Carleman criterion
for a particular perturbation series (see for example [24],
Theorems XII.17 and XII.18 and the deﬁnition on p. 43
in [91], p. 410 in [5], or the elucidating discussion in
Ref. [92]). The Carleman criterion determines, roughly
speaking, if nonanalytic contributions exist for a given ef-
fect which is described by a speciﬁed perturbation series.
The relevance of the Carleman criterion for the perturba-
tive expansions encountered in the current investigation,
is discussed in [20].

We also mention the connection of the perturbative
expansion for the LoSurdo–Stark eﬀect to perturbative
expansions in quantum chromodynamics. The divergent
nonalternating and alternating contributions to the per-
turbation series [see Eqs. (2) and (3)] correspond in their
mathematical structure to infrared and ultraviolet renor-
malons [93], and the structure of a doubly cut Borel
plane (see Sec. IV) is used in [67,68] for the construc-
tion of an optimal conformal mapping, which is devised
with the notion of accelerating the convergence of per-
turbative quantum chromodynamics.

summation methods in those cases where perturbation
theory breaks down at large coupling. As explained in
Sec. V, even in situations where the perturbation series
diverges strongly, it can still be used to obtain meaningful
physical results if it is combined with a suitable resum-
mation method. In a relatively weak ﬁeld, it is possible to
obtain more accurate numerical results by resummation
than by optimal truncation of the perturbation series (see
also [20]). In a strong ﬁeld, it is possible to obtain phys-
ically correct results by resummation even though the
perturbation series diverges strongly (see the discussion
in Sec. V and the data in Tables I and II). By resumma-
tion, the perturbation series which is inherently a weak-
coupling expansion can be given a physical interpretation
even in situations where the coupling is large.
In the
application discussed here (LoSurdo–Stark energy shift),
the contour-improved resummation methods introduced
in Secs. III and IV provide results which are in agreement
with theoretical data presented in [33,46,52,54].

APPENDIX: DIVERGENT PERTURBATION

SERIES IN QUANTUM FIELD THEORY

We brieﬂy indicate some aspects of certain divergent
perturbation series in quantum ﬁeld theory, in particular
the quantum electrodynamic (QED) eﬀective action and
the associated pair–production amplitude for electron–
positron pairs. We use natural units in which the re-
duced Planck’s constant, the permittivity of the vacuum
and the speed of light (in ﬁeld-free vacuum) assume the
value of unity (¯h = ǫ0 = c = 1). The one-loop QED eﬀec-
tive action for an arbitrary electric and magnetic ﬁeld per
space-time volume reads [this result can be found e.g. in
Eq. (4-123) in [89], upon inclusion of an additional coun-
terterm; or [95]]

It is perhaps interesting to note that the electric-
magnetic duality (invariance under the transformation
a → −i b, b → i a) immediately follows from the compact,
one-dimensional integral representation for the eﬀective
action given in Eq. (A1). The particular cases of a pure
magnetic and a pure electric ﬁeld are of some interest,
because they can be used as model series for divergent
alternating and nonalternating asymptotic perturbation
series [8,9,20,76].
In the case of a pure magnetic ﬁeld
B = |B|, the result reads [see e.g. Eq. (5) in [9]]

where me is the mass of the electron. This result can be
expressed as a divergent asymptotic perturbation series
in the coupling parameter gB = e2B2/m4
e. For the pure
electric ﬁeld, the result can be inferred by the replace-
ment B → −i E where E = |E|, and the inclusion of a
converging factor; it reads

[Eq. (7) of [20] and the expression before Eq. (10) of [9]
contain typographical errors]. We take the opportunity
to supplement the proportionality factor for the expres-
sion in Eq. (7) of [20] to yield the eﬀective action per
space-time volume element; it reads e2E2/(8π2). As evi-
dent from the Eq. (A3), the integration of the Borel–Pad´e
transform for the electric ﬁeld case should be carried out
along the contour C+1 shown here in Fig. 1. When this
contour is used, then a sign change results for the imag-
inary contributions in Table 1 of [20] (the sign change
of the imaginary part according to the choice of the in-
tegration contour has been discussed at length in [20]).
The magnitude of the imaginary part yields the pair-
production amplitude. The contour C+1 is used in the
current investigation (and in the context of the related

10

brief discussion in [20]) for the calculation of nonper-
turbative imaginary eﬀects, i.e. the autoionization decay
width of atomic states (LoSurdo–Stark eﬀect).

The divergent asymptotic perturbation series for the
cases of the magnetic and electric ﬁeld, generated by ex-
pansion of the results in Eqs. (A2) and (A3), can be found
in Eqs. (6) and (7) of [9] (B–ﬁeld, alternating series cou-
pling parameter gB = e2B2/m4
e) and in Eqs. (8) and (9)
of [20] (E–ﬁeld, nonalternating series, coupling param-
eter gE = e2E2/m4
e). The singularity structure of the
Borel transform of the series for the magnetic ﬁeld case
has been discussed in some detail in [76]. The pertur-
bation series for the LoSurdo–Stark eﬀect contains both
nonalternating and alternating components so that its re-
summation represents a comparatively more interesting
task. The same applies to the more complex perturbation
series calculated in [94] for the renormalization group γ
function, whose resummation – at strong coupling – has
been discussed in [73,94]. In this particular case, there
is no imaginary part involved, and the integration of the
Borel–Pad´e transform proceeds along the contour C0 in-
troduced in [73].

Exchange in a Boltzmann gas of bosons with several internal states leads to collective transport
of internal polarization. The internal dynamics can be understood as Larmor precession in the
presence of a torque induced by atoms on each other via exchange coupling. A generalized Bloch
equation that includes interatomic exchange eﬀects as well as orbital motion in the gas is derived
and used to interpret recent experiment by Lewandowski et al. [1] as an excitation of a collective
wave of internal state polarization. It is shown that exchange leads to formation of domains in which
precession frequencies are synchronized.

Atomic gases in the cold collision regime characterized
by de Broglie wavelength long compared to the range of
interparticle potential represent an interesting quantum
many-body system. Most surprisingly, spin waves in a
cold spin polarized gas are collective excitations. This
phenomenon was actively studied in the 80’s, ﬁrst pre-
dicted by Bashkin [2] and independently by Lhuillier and
Lalo¨e [3], and conﬁrmed by NMR experiments in spin po-
by Johnson et al. [4], in 3He by Nacher et al.
larized H
↓
[5], and in dilute 3He
4He mixtures by Gully and Mullin
[6]. A detailed quantitative theory of the observed NMR
spectra was given by Levy and Ruckenstein [7]. Bigelow
et al. [8] demonstrated that collective spin waves are pre-
served even in the Knudsen regime. The theory was fur-
ther developed by Miyake et al. [9] and reviewed in [10].
Exchange eﬀects in gases are not limited to spin phe-
nomena, since any pair of internal states can play a role
similar to spin states in exchange collisions [11]. Apart
from new energy scales arising due to internal states spec-
trum, the main diﬀerence is in the anisotropic character
of exchange. For generic internal states the Hamiltonian
does not have spin-rotational symmetry, which opens a
number of new interesting possibilities. Verhaar et al.
[13] demonstrated that interatomic exchange leads to en-
hancement (by a factor of two) of the density shift of
Rabi transition. Tiesinga et al. [14] and Kokkelmans et
al. [15] considered application of this eﬀect in Cesium
fountain clock. Similar exchange enhancement occurs in
the optical spectrum density shift. The theory [2,3] of
collective spin-waves, can be straightforwardly adapted
to describe optical excitations [12].

New aspects of cold collision exchange arise in experi-
ments on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in trapped
gases. The exchange part of the density shift is absent in
BEC at T = 0 and is reduced at 0 < T < TBEC [12,16,17].
Interestingly, in this case all modes involving coupling of
internal states are split into doublets [18].

In a recent experiment [1] Rabi transition was studied
in a cigar shaped sample of Rb vapor contained in Ioﬀe-

that the polarization does not remain in the x
y plane
during free Larmor precession. This was argued to re-
sult from spatial segregation of atoms with diﬀerent z
spin components. However, the conﬁnement potential
[1] spin dependence was very weak, and the best esti-
mate of segregation due to the diﬀerence in mechanical
forces experienced by atoms with diﬀerent spins was at
least an order of magnitude longer than the time
0.2 s
of the z component buildup.

≈

We argue below that the phenomena of Ref. [1] are
explained by coherent evolution of atoms’ internal state
rather than by mechanical segregation in the gas. The
observed z component proﬁle is readily accounted for by
interatomic exchange coupling. The transition frequency
[1] varies along the sample axis, and a short time after
precession started a gradient of precession angle builds
up. Now, consider two interacting atoms with slightly
diﬀerent polarization due to spatially varying Larmor fre-
quency. The exchange interaction of these atoms can be
described [11] as precession of each atom’s spin around
the net spin of both atoms. Since both atoms have trans-
verse polarization, the precession about a net spin (which
is also transverse) will move the spins out of the x
y
plane and both of them will acquire a ﬁnite z component.

The system [1] is deep in the cold collision regime, since

the forward scattering approximation also known as the

is just λn along the gas polarization s, time-independent
in this frame. Since s is transverse, Rabi transition will
generate a z component of the test atom polarization,
even if initially it was in the x

y plane.

Before accepting this explanation one needs to discuss
energy conservation. The probabilities to ﬁnd the test
atom in the up and down states after coming out of the
box diﬀer from those in the initial state, since its z spin
component changes. This means that the test atom en-
ergy can change by ¯hω0. The total energy of the system,
however, does not change because the spins coupled by
exchange precess together around the net spin so that the
total spin is conserved [11]. The change of the net spin
z component in the box is equal and opposite to the test
atom spin change, as required by the energy balance.

Although everything is consistent with energy conser-
6.8GHz much
vation, the energy change of ¯hω0 with ω0 ≈
higher than other frequencies in the system [1] may ap-
pear counter-intuitive. The temperature T = 600 nK [1]
10 KHz, the trap frequencies
corresponds to kBT /¯h
are (ω⊥, ωz) = (230, 7) Hz. However, the characteristic
exchange frequency is λn
140 Hz for the typical den-
≃
sity n = 2 1013 cm−3 (see below). This is much higher
than the transition frequency broadening estimated from
the precession decay time to be of order of few Hz [1].
This makes the exchange induced Rabi transitions at the
energy ¯hω0 fully coherent, despite that ¯hω0 ≫

The length corresponding to one Rabi cycle is

λn.

This is larger than the sample radius r⊥ = 7.3 µm but
much smaller than the sample length rz = 240 µm. Since

movement of an atom by

ing the spin by π

the exchange coupling is a viable mechanism for spin re-
orientation in this system.

The separation of Rb atoms into a gas sample and a
test particle in the thought experiment is artiﬁcial. The
atoms in [1] share both roles, by inducing precession on
each other via exchange coupling. One therefore has to
consider collective dynamics of atom polarization [2,3].

The ﬁrst term is the Zeeman frequency shift due to the

2λ12s in the expression (10) for Ω(r) representing the ef-
fect of exchange is not considered in Ref. [1]. The role
of this term is subtle. It drops out from the Bloch equa-

Since the interaction parameters λjk for Rb coincide
within 3%, spin is approximately conserved by elastic
collisions. In this case, the spin current relaxation rate γ
is the same as for the average particle momentum, and no
spin relaxation appears in the Bloch equation (10). Elas-
tic collisions control spin relaxation indirectly, by making
spin diﬀusion constant complex [2,3].

The transport equations (10),(13) can be simpliﬁed for
a one dimensional system [1] by averaging over sample
crossection. Large exchange λn
ω⊥ [1] leads to fast
dynamical averaging of spin polarization in each crossec-
tion with parameters slowly varying along the sample
length. In averaging Eqs.(10),(13) we assume Gaussian
density proﬁle n(ρ) = ne−ρ2/r2
⊥. The averaging of the
terms in Eqs.(10),(13) quadratic in density and/or spin
is performed as

In summary, exchange coupling in a trapped gas leads
to complex collective dynamics of polarization. Polar-
ized atoms exert torque on the spin current creating a
z component proﬁle in the presence of spatially varying
transition frequency. Results of numerical simulation of
the dynamics of the Rb system [1] are in agreement with
observations. Surprisingly, the buildup of the z compo-
nent is accompanied by synchronization of precession fre-
quencies. In the inhomogeneous state the sample breaks
into two or more synchronized domains. Spin relaxation
is caused by spin currents between the domains.

Synchronized precession should manifest itself in ex-
periment as transition frequency locking to one value in
the entire sample, if it is a single domain. Several syn-
chronized domains formed within the sample will give
rise to several plateaus in the transition frequency spa-
tial dependence. Spin density vanishing between diﬀerent
domains should be observable by the spatially resolved
Ramsey fringes technique of Ref. [1]

The mechanism of transverse spin component decay in
the synchronized state is polarization mixing caused by
spin current between diﬀerent domains. The time scale
of spin decay, set by spin diﬀusion, is much longer than
the elastic collision time. The z component ﬁrst builds
up due to spin currents and then decays due to (longitu-
dinal) diﬀusion, with characteristic time (L/2π)2γ/α
0.5 secs (see Fig.1). This is consistent with Ref. [1].

The helium ground state nonrelativistic energy with 24 signiﬁcant digits is presented. The calcu-
lations are based on variational expansion with randomly chosen exponents. This data can be used
as a benchmark for other approaches for many electron and/or three-body systems.

From the early days of the quantum mechanics the
ground state ionization energy of the helium atom was
a benchmark for approximate methods of solving non-
relativistic Schr¨odinger equation for a few–body system.
One of the earliest variational calculations has been per-
formed by Hylleraas [1] in 1929 and it yields an about 5
signiﬁcant digits for the nonrelativistic ionization poten-
tial. In 1957, Kinoshita [2] presented a 7 digit number
obtained with a 39 parameter function, which along with
higher order corrections including the Lamb shift calcu-
lations conﬁrmed a very good agreement with the best
experimental value. Since that time with the develop-
ment of computer power the accuracy grows very rapidly.
We would like to mention here the two most recent cal-
culations. The ﬁrst [3] is aimed to elaborate an eﬃcient
variational method for the many electron atoms. The
second [4] is to ﬁnd an eﬀective and economical way for
studying the helium and helium-like two electron atoms.

In this short report we want to present a new very ac-
curate value for the nonrelativistic energy of the helium
ground state.
In our calculations we strictly follows a
method described in [5]. The two modiﬁcations are to be

stated. First, a sextuple precision arithmetics (about 48
decimal digits) implemented as a Fortran-90 module has
been used instead of a multiprecision package written by
Bailey. That gives an about 5-fold improvement in com-
putational time and allows for to increase signiﬁcantly
a length of a basis set. Second, we have taken a multi-
layer variational wave function with 5 independent sets
of variational parameters (instead of 4 as in [5]), which
consecutively approximates one after another smaller and
smaller distances of electrons with respect to a nucleus.
Table I demonstrates a convergence of the variational
expansion with the number of basis functions. Extrap-
olated value has been obtained by means of the simple
extrapolation formula,

E(extrap) = E(N ) − A × N −α,

where parameters A and α are taken from the best ﬁt of
the last 4 or 5 calculations.

In Table II a comparison with the most recent and

most accurate values is presented.

Abstract. We review the developments made during the last decade in the theory
of polarization bremsstrahlung in the non-relativistic domain. A literature survey
covering the latest history of the phenomenon is given. The main features which
distinguish the polarization bremsstrahlung from other mechanisms of radiation are
discussed and illustrated by the results of numerical calculations.

1. Introduction.

In this paper we review recent developments
bremsstrahlung (BrS).

in the theory of polarizational

Consider the two mechanisms of the photon radiation during a collision shown in
ﬁgure 1. On the left-hand side of the ﬁgure, ordinary BrS (OBrS) is illustrated. In this
case the emission of a photon occurs by a charged projectile accelerated in the static
ﬁeld of a target. This is a well known quantum mechanical process the basic description
of which can be found in textbooks (see, e.g. [1]). The right-hand picture in the ﬁgure
illustrates the polarizational BrS (PBrS) [2]. Here, the photon emission occurs due to
the virtual excitations (polarization) of the target electrons under the action of the ﬁeld
created by a charged projectile.

The importance and the fundamental character of the OBrS process has been
recognized long ago (for a review of historical background see [3]). Since then it has
been intensively studied theoretically, numerically and experimentally in a wide range
of the projectile and the emitted photon energies, diﬀerent geometries of the emission,
and a variety of atomic and ionic targets. The reviews of the results obtained in this
ﬁeld include [4–8]. The spectral [9] and spectral-angular distributions [10] of OBrS are
tabulated over wide ranges of energies of projectile electron and emitted photon and for
a number of atomic targets.

Figure 1.
Schematic representation [88] of the ordinary and polarizational BrS
processes. Ordinary BrS is the photon emission of a charged projectile accelerated in
the static ﬁeld of the target. Polarizational bremsstrahlung mechanism considers the
photon emission of the target electrons, virtually excited by the projectile. Virtual
excitation of the electrons is equivalent to polarization of the target.

The polarizational mechanism of the radiation was recognized relatively recently
[11–19] where the ﬁrst qualitative and quantitative estimates were made of the role of
the target polarization in forming the BrS spectrum in an electron-atom collision in the
range of photon energies close to the atomic ionization potentials.

In the subsequent decade the theory of the eﬀect was developed further and
a number of new phenomena was recognized and described both analytically and
numerically. An important idea of a close relationship between wide and powerful
maxima in experimentally measured emission spectra of electrons [20] and the giant
dipole resonances in photoionization of many-electron atoms was formulated [21]. The
eﬀect of a dynamic descreening (‘stripping’) of a many-electron subshell for the photon
energy larger than its ionization potential was formulated [22] and on its basis the
additional asymmetry of the experimentally measured emission spectrum [23] was
explained. The numerical calculations of the PBrS spectrum and angular distribution
in collisions of electrons with many-electron atoms were performed for fast [24, 25] and
intermediate energy [26, 27] projectiles. A formalism and speciﬁc features of the dipole-
photon polarizational BrS in relativistic collisions of structureless charged particles with
atoms were reported [28, 29].

The theory of PBrS in collisions of charged particles, other than electrons, with
atoms/ions was developed. In [30] analytical treatment of the exactly solvable problem
of the PBrS arising in a positron and a proton collision with a hydrogen atom was given.
It was shown that over wide range of the photon energies the BrS intensities for both
projectiles are of the same order of magnitude. The PBrS formalism for a bare-ion—
atom collision [31,32] and a bare-ion—hydrogen-ion collision [33] was developed and the
performed calculations allowed to explain the earlier measured experimental data on the
BrS spectrum of protons. A more general treatment of the BrS arisen in the collision
of two complex colliders (atoms, ions), which accounts also for the recoil eﬀect of the
nuclei, was carried out in [34, 35].

The important feature of the PBrS mechanism is that it leads to the emission in

Polarizational bremsstrahlung in non-relativistic collisions

collisions of two electrically neutral objects possessing an internal structure. In [34, 35]
for the ﬁrst time it was demonstrated that the intensive BrS emission can appear in
atom–atom collision. In this case the radiation is due to the mutual virtual polarization
of the colliders. The total induced dipole moment of the system alters during the
collision, and this results in the photon emission. The general formalism developed
in the cited papers allowed to express the BrS amplitude via the generalized atomic
polarizabilities of the colliders.
It was demonstrated that no dipole photon emission
appear in symmetric collisions. The speciﬁc features (due to the Coulomb repulsion) of
the PBrS formed in ion–ion collision were studied in [36]. The numerical calculations
carried out in [34] have shown that the radiation intensity in the collision of two
neutral (but diﬀerent) atoms is comparable to that formed in the collision where one
of the colliders is substituted with a charged heavy particle or an electron of the same
velocity. Later the formalism, initially developed for non-relativistic atomic collisions,
was extended to the relativistic domain [37–39].

For several cases which allow for the exact analytical treatment of the PBrS process
the corresponding formulae were derived. These include the PBrS formed in fast
electron–hydrogen atom collision [40, 41], in electron/positron collisions with muonic
hydrogen [42, 43], and in the collision of a charged particle with positronium [44].
its (qualitative) independence
A universal character of the PBrS mechanism,
on the type of the interaction between a projectile and a target was demonstrated
in [45, 46] for the processes of neutron– and neutrino–atom scattering (see also the
eralier publications [47, 48]). The PBrS manifests itself in nuclear collisions [49], and in
nuclear reactions such as α, β, γ decays or nuclear ﬁssion process [50].

i.e.

In the papers [39,51–53] a theoretical study of the BrS process accompanied by the
excitation or ionization of the target (an ‘inelastic’ BrS) was carried out. The photon
energy intervals were established where the contribution of the inelastic BrS is small
compared to the BrS process without the change in the target’s state.

Some of the results, obtained within the period until the early 90th, were reviewed

in [2, 54, 55].

During the last decade a systematic quantitative investigation of the PBrS has
been carried out. With the increase of the computer power it has become possible to
eﬀectively compute the characteristics of BrS for various projectiles, complex targets
(isolated many-electron atoms, atoms in an environment, clusters) and over broad
ranges of photon energies. The accurate theoretical predictions on the magnitude
of the BrS cross sections, obtained over ranges of energies and targets accessible to
experiment [56–59], become available. The combination of theoretical and numerical
tools has allowed not only to analyze and test diﬀerent schemes used to describe the
scattering process and the dynamic response of the target (these are two key elements
of the PBrS process) but to develop alternative methods as well.

A general approach to consider the BrS process (both the ordinary and the
polarizational) in collisions with many-electron targets is based on a consistent
application of quantum mechanics and quantum many-body theory. The main results

Polarizational bremsstrahlung in non-relativistic collisions

obtained by using this approach include: (a) application of the many-body theory for
accurate calculations of the dynamic generalized polarizability of the target [60–64] (b)
development of the methods for approximate treatment of of the dynamic response
of the target [65–70], (c) calculation of the total BrS spectra of in collisions of non-
relativistic electrons on many-electron atoms over wide range of emitted photon energies
including the regions of giant resonances [71–74], (d) theoretical description of the PBrS
in collisions of slow atomic particles and in collisions involving atoms in the excited
states [75–77], (e) numerical calculations of inelastic BrS [78, 79], (f) theoretical and
numerical description of the BrS process in electron-cluster collisions [80–84], (g) the
full relativistic description of the BrS in a charged particle–atom collision [85–87].

Some of the results presented in the papers cited above were reviewed by us
some time ago [88]. In full the results obtained by means of the quantum-mechanical
description during the whole period of the PBrS history were summarized in the
book [89] (in Russian). Thus, the motivation for writing the current review is to present
the results obtained in our group during the latest period for a wider community. In
what follows we focus on the achievements made in the development of the theory
of PBrS formed in non-relativistic collisions of various particles with isolated many-
electron atoms. We also included the part devoted to the BrS formed in atom–atom
collisions. The reason for this is that although these results were obtained nearly twenty
years ago [34, 35] they have not been reviewed in international journals. The speciﬁc
features of the polarizational BrS process in electron-cluster collisions and those due to
the relativistic eﬀects in electron-atom collisions are not included in this paper but are
discussed in other reviews in this issue [90, 91].

During the last decade another approach to the BrS problem (with both channels
included) has been developed for theoretical and numerical description of the process
in collision with isolated atoms and in plasma [92–98]. It is based on a semi-classical
description of the scattering process and the ordinary BrS channel [99], whereas the
dynamic atomic response is calculated within the local density approximation. These
results were reviewed recently [100, 101], and are not discussed in detail in the present
paper.

Other issues which are left beyond the scope of this review include the inﬂuence
of the density eﬀect on the PBrS for energetic projectiles penetrating through dense
medium [102–106] and the multiphoton PBrS [92, 107–110].

The atomic system of units is used.

2. Main features of the polarizational bremsstrahlung process.

In this section we review the peculiar features of polarizational BrS which distinguish
this mechanism from ordinary BrS and which manifest themselves in the spectrum of the
total BrS. Focusing on the physical nature of these phenomena and to avoid unnecessary
complexities, we consider the BrS process of a non-relativistic charged structureless
particle on a many-electron target (called an atom, for brevity) within the framework of

the plane-wave ﬁrst Born approximation for the scattering process and the dipole-photon
scheme for the description of the photon-atom and photon-projectile interactions. Such
treatment, although quite often being insuﬃcient for the quantitative description of the
process, allows one to carry out a simple qualitative analysis and to explain all speciﬁc
features of PBrS.

Let p1 and p2 denote the momenta of initial and ﬁnal states of the projectile with
mass m and charge e. To simplify the formalism we consider the BrS process in the
collision with a spherically symmetric neutral atom. This restriction is not too rigid
since the eﬀects described below also occur in the BrS process on a target with a ground
state of arbitrary symmetry.

Considering the two mechanisms of the photon emission one derives the following

expression for the total amplitude of the process:

The ﬁrst term in (1) describes the ordinary part of the total amplitude.

charge of the nucleus. Hence, ford is dependent on the static distribution of the charge
in the atom. The polarizational amplitude fpol is expressed via a generalized atomic
dynamic polarizability α(ω, q) which appears as a result of the action of two ﬁeld on the
atom: the ﬁeld of the projectile and the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the emitted photon.

The ﬁrst feature which distinguishes between the two mechanisms follows
immediately from (1). The amplitude of ordinary BrS is inversely proportional to the
mass of projectile, while the polarizational part is independent of it. The explanation
for this fact follows from the basic principles of electrodynamics (e.g.
[1]). During the
process of ordinary BrS, it is the projectile that emits the photon. The intensity of
this radiation is proportional to the square of the projectile acceleration in the external
ﬁeld of a target. In turn, the acceleration is proportional to 1/m and this dependence
manifests itself in ford. In contrast, during the polarizational BrS the projectile serves
as a source of the external ﬁeld acting on the atomic electrons, and thus the amplitude
of this process is almost insensitive to the variations of m [2]. Moreover, the intensity
of PBrS for a heavy projectile is comparable and can be even higher than that of an
electron of the same velocity [34].

Other qualitative diﬀerences between the two mechanisms of the photon emission
one can trace by comparing the dependencies of ford and fpol on the photon energy and
on the momentum transfer.

The OBrS amplitude is a smooth function of ω. The only peculiarity appears
in the soft-photon region ω
0 where a simple perturbative approach, giving an
inﬁnite magnitude of ford, fails to describe the process. This phenomenon, known as
the ”infrared catastrophe”, had been recognized and understood long ago [1]. The q

function of q. Qualitatively, the value F (q) deﬁnes the number of atomic electrons inside

the sphere of a radius r
where F (0) = Z and decreases monotonically with the increase of q. In the case of large

The PBrS appears as a result of the alteration of the atomic dipole moment induced
during the collision. There are two external ﬁelds - the ﬁeld the photon and the Coulomb
ﬁeld of the projectile - which act on the atom in this process. The dynamic response of
the target depends, therefore, on the parameters of both ﬁelds. Formally, it is reﬂected
in the dependence of the generalized dynamic polarizability α(ω, q) on two variables. We
use the term ’generalized’ when addressing to α(ω, q) in order to stress the dependence
on q, and, thus, to distinguish this quantity from the dipole dynamic polarizability,
αd(ω), to which α(ω, q) reduces in the limit of small transferred momenta:

lim
q→0

α(ω, q) = αd(ω) .

(2)

The dependence on q appears because of the action of the external Coulomb ﬁeld of
the projectile. This ﬁeld distorts the electrons’ orbits and induces a dipole moment of the
atomic system. The dipole polarization of the electron cloud is most pronounced if the
Coulomb ﬁeld of the projectile is uniform on the scale of Rat, i.e. when the projectile

well as the cross section, can be expressed through αd(ω). For small distances, r

the ﬁeld of the projectile is almost spherically symmetric. Therefore, it induces a small
dipole moment on the target. Hence, in contrast to the ordinary BrS process, it is the
large distances between the projectile and the target which are of the most importance
for the PBrS mechanism [17, 21].

The ω dependence of α(ω, q) reﬂects the ability of the electron cloud to be
dynamically polarized by an external electromagnetic ﬁeld of a given frequency.
In
a many-electron atom the electrons are distributed among the atomic subshells. Each
subshell is characterized by an ionization potential I. In terms of classical mechanics this
corresponds to the frequency of the rotation of electrons of a given subshell around the
nucleus. Using this analogy one may say that the dynamic response of the electron cloud
to the external ﬁeld increases for those ω which are close to the ionization thresholds of
the target subshells. Therefore, in the region

I1 < ω < I1s,

(3)

where I1 and I1s stand, respectively, for the ionization potentials of the outermost shell
and of the 1s shell, the function α(ω, q) is non-monotonic with extrema in vicinities of
the ionization potentials.

This happens, in particular, when the photon energy lies within the region of a
giant dipole resonance of the photoionization cross section of a many-electron atomic
subshell [111]. For the ﬁrst time wide maxima in the emission spectra were observed
experimentally in electron scattering from (solid) Ba, La and Ce [112, 113]. Later these
were explained theoretically [16] by relating the maxima to the virtual excitations of
the 3d-subshell electrons.
In [20] a powerful maximum was observed in the emission
spectrum in electron-La collision.
In the subsequent paper [21] for the ﬁrst time an
important conclusion was drawn about the common nature of the giant resonances in
photoionization and those in PBrS spectra. To reveal this similarity one recalls that at
large distances between the projectile and the atom the amplitude of the PBrS process
is proportional to the the dipole dynamic polarizability, αd(ω). The imaginary part of
this quantity is related to the photoionization cross section σγ(ω) through (e.g. [114]):

Im α(ω) =

σγ(ω),

≈

where c
137 is the velocity of light. Since the OBrS amplitude is real (see (1)), the
modulus square of the imaginary part of fpol enters the total BrS cross section as an
additive term. Therefore, a maximum in σγ(ω) manifests itself in the BrS spectrum as
well reﬂecting the collective nature of the dynamic response of atomic electrons.

≫

Although based on the assumption that main contribution to fpol comes from the
region of large distances r
Rat, which does not always lead to a correct quantitative
result, the qualitative arguments of [21] provided a clear physical explanation of the
nature of powerful maxima in emission spectra. The experiments, carried out later,
supported the theoretical prediction. The maxima in the BrS spectra were measured for
Ba and several rare-earth elements [115, 116], for La and for atoms from the lanthanum
group [117], for Xe [23, 118] and for Ba [56]. In all these experiments, performed for
various energies of the incoming electron (ranging from several hundreds of eV up to
several keV), the powerful BrS maxima were observed for photon energies within the
ranges of the giant resonances in the photoionization cross section of the 4d subshells.
The existence of the maxima in the BrS spectrum due to a strong eﬀect
of polarization of many-electron atomic subshells was conﬁrmed by a number of
independent theoretical calculations [22, 24–27, 34, 60, 61, 63, 66, 68] which were carried
out within the frameworks of various models.

In general, in the whole ω-region deﬁned by (3), a highly non-monotonic behaviour
of the generalized polarizability of a many-electron atom results in a series of peculiarities
(maxima, minima, cusps) in the total BrS spectrum. The important role of the
polarizational mechanism in forming the total BrS spectra over a wide range of photon
energies was analyzed in [71–73, 77, 119].

For the photon energies noticeably higher than the 1s ionization potential, ω

I1s,
the ω dependence of α(ω, q) is much like that for the cloud of free electrons. The leading

This shows that for large ω the atomic electrons do not participate in the screening of

The physical reason for this eﬀect (following [22] we use the term ‘stripping’ eﬀect) is
I1s, the electrons of all atomic subshells may be treated as free ones [15].
that, for ω
If the incident electron is also free (the Born approximation) then there is no dipole
radiation by a system of free electrons.

≫

These arguments allow one to construct an approximate expression for the total
BrS amplitude for photon energies lower than the 1s-shell ionization threshold [22]. For
a ﬁxed value of ω the target electrons can be divided into two groups, the ’inner’ and
the ’outer’ electrons. The former are those whose binding energies, Iin, exceed ω, and,
therefore, their orbits are not distorted noticeably by an external electromagnetic ﬁeld
of a frequency ω. Hence, the inner electrons do not contribute to the amplitude of the
PBrS. The outer electrons have the binding energies Iout less than ω. Under the action of
the ﬁeld they behave as free electrons, and their contribution to fpol can be described by
(5) where F (q) must be substituted with the form-factor of the outer electrons, Fout(q).
As a result the total BrS amplitude acquires the form

where Fin(q) stands for the form-factor of the inner electrons. This expression
demonstrates that the outer electrons do not participate in the screening of the nucleus
in other words, the nucleus is ’stripped’ by a total number Nout of the outer
(or,
electrons). The physical reason for this partial ’stripping’ is as formulated above: for
Iout the outer electrons can be considered as free and, therefore, there is no dipole-
ω
photon emission by the system ’projectile electron + the outer electrons’.

≫

Although the ’stripping’ approximation does not account for the speciﬁc details
it allows one to estimate the
of the PBrS amplitude near each subshell threshold,
behaviour of the smooth background of the BrS cross section curve. In particular, on its
basis the asymmetry of the giant resonances in the experimentally measured emission
spectra [23,115,117] was explained. Namely, from (7) follows that the diﬀerence between
two values of the function ωftot calculated for (a) ω
Ij (Ij is the ionization potential
Ij, is proportional to the form-factor Fj(q) of the
of the jth subshell), and for (b) ω
Nj, where Nj is the number of the electrons
subshell which can be estimates as Fj(q)
in the subshell. Therefore, the diﬀerence between the two amplitudes is proportional to
Nj, and the increase in the cross section is σ(ω

This qualitative explanation was conﬁrmed by numerical calculations [24] carried
out within the framework of the non-relativistic Born approximation. Later the
’stripping’ was generalized, going beyond the Born approximation [65, 70, 120].

ωα(0, q)

When the photon energy becomes small compared with the ﬁrst ionization potential
of the target one can expect the decrease of the contribution of the polarizational BrS
channel into the total spectrum. From (1) follows that for ω

mω2αd/e
In contrast, the OBrS term increases. For the ratio of the two terms fpol/ford ∼
vanishes as ω goes to zero. For low but non-zero values of ω the contribution of the
polarizational channel strongly depends on the magnitude of the static polarizability.
The higher the magnitude of αd is, the wider is the ω interval where the contribution
of fpol might be noticeable.

≪

∼

These arguments are valid also beyond the range of validity of the ﬁrst Born
approximation, on the basis of which (1) was derived. In the low-frequency limit the
fel/ω
OBrS amplitude is expressed in terms of the amplitude of elastic scattering, ford ∝
(e.g., [114]). On the other hand, the process of PBrS occurs most eﬀectively at large
distances between the projectile and the target, where the wavefunction of the projectile
is not aﬀected strongly by the potential, and one can use the Born approximation
to describe the polarizational channel even for low-energy projectiles. Therefore, the
ratio of the two amplitudes still is proportional to ω2αd.
In [18] the role of the
polarizational channel was studied in the inverse BrS process (i.e. BrS absorption) for
slow electrons scattered from atoms. It was demonstrated that for an e−-Ar scattering
the polarizational mechanism changes noticeably the absorption coeﬃcients, whereas
for an e−-Ne scattering its inﬂuence is much less. This quantitative eﬀect is due
to large diﬀerence in the static polarizabilities: αAr
d = 2.66
a.u. [121]. Rather strong eﬀect of the target polarization on the BrS spectra was reported
recently [122] for low-energy (ε1 = 0.4 . . . 3.5 eV) electron–rare-gas atom collisions.

d = 11.10 a.u. and αAr

In general, in the collisions of slow heavy particles with atoms both the ordinary
and the polarizational mechanisms fail to describe adequately the radiation spectrum.
In such processes another mechanism, known as molecular orbital radiation, becomes
[123]). Nevertheless, the polarizational BrS is important in
important (see, e.g.,
asymmetric slow collisions of atoms and ions in the region of large impact parameters
[75]. The intensity of the OBrS is negligibly small due the large masses of the colliders.
However, the situation with the radiation formed in the slow charged particle–
excited hydrogen collision is somewhat diﬀerent, compared with PBrS and aslo with
molecular orbital radiation. More accurately, in addition to these types of radiation
there is a peculiar source of low-frequency photon emission [76]. In this case the radiation
is generated by the rotating dipole moment of the hydrogen during the collision. The
speciﬁc feature of the hydrogen atom introduces the linear Stark eﬀect (see, e.g., [124]).
The electric ﬁeld of the projectile splits the initially degenerated levels of the excited
hydrogen. Atomic states with a given principal number form a Stark multiplet. The
components of the multiplet already possess a dipole moment. The vector of this dipole

Polarizational bremsstrahlung in non-relativistic collisions

moment rotates following the movement of the projectile, and the radiation appears as a
result of this rotation. We stress that this mechanism of BrS is intrinsic for systems with
a linear Stark eﬀect. This is also a distinguishing feature from the ‘real’ PBrS which
also appears because of the alteration of the target’s dipole moment. In the latter case it
is really the induced dipole moment intrinsic for systems with a quadratic Stark eﬀect.
As a result the character of these spectra at low frequencies are quite diﬀerent [76].

Once the internal dynamic structure of a target is taken into account, the next
logical step is to consider the radiative processes which are accompanied by the
excitation or ionization of the target. Following [51] we call BrS processes of this type
‘inelastic’ BrS contrary to the ‘elastic’ one, when the target remains in its ground state
after the collision. Within the framework of the same approximations as above the
amplitude of the scattering process accompanied by the real atomic transition from the
initial ground state 0 to the ﬁnal state m may be written as follows:

It is important to establish the contribution of inelastic channels to the total
emission spectrum. This is not purely of theoretical interest since experimentally it
is quite diﬃcult to separate elastic and inelastic channels. To do this it is necessary to
observe the ﬁnal state of the target with simultaneous detection of the photon.

It has been demonstrated that over a wide region of the photon frequencies, the
elastic channel dominates over the inelastic one in the total BrS spectrum for both
heavy [51, 53] and light [52, 53] projectiles scattered on a many-electron atom. Semi-
quantitatively, the cross sections of the elastic BrS, of both the ordinary and the
polarizational nature, exceed those of the inelastic by a factor Z. The explanation
is as follows [51,52]. During the elastic BrS the contributions of each atomic electron to
the polarizational part of the total amplitude (1) are coherent, as in Rayleigh scattering
of light. Considering the case of a neutral atom and having in mind that the ordinary
part of the elastic BrS spectrum is approximately proportional to the nuclear charge
squared, one ﬁnds that the total elastic cross section is proportional to Z 2. In contrast,
during the inelastic BrS the contributions of each electrons must be summed in the
cross section rather than in the amplitude (8). Hence, the inelastic BrS cross section
is proportional to Z and is parametrically small in the case of a many-electron target,
when Z

feature in the spectrum of PBrS [79] similar to that which occurs in inelastic scattering,
where it is known as the Bethe ridge [124]. In more detail we discuss this phenomenon

The numerical comparison of the relative role of elastic and inelastic channels in

In electron/positron–many-electron atom scattering elastic BrS dominates
parametrically over the inelastic one in the region (10). However, if one is interested
in accurate data on the total BrS cross section it is necessary to include the inelastic
channels into the computational scheme. Up to now, mostly due to technical diﬃculties,
numerical investigations of the role of inelastic BrS have not been as extensive as in the
elastic case. The achievements in this ﬁeld include the model theoretical study carried
out in [118, 125] in connection with the experimental data on the intensity of the BrS
spectrum in e−+Xe collision as a function of the incoming electron energy ε1 [118, 126]
(see also [127, 128] for the experimental data in e−+Ar collision).

For low-Z targets the absolute magnitudes of both terms from (1), f ord and f pol, and
the terms f (m)
from (8) are all of the same order. In this case, it is the charge
of the projectile which introduces peculiarities in the total radiative spectrum. It can be
shown that, both for high frequencies of the photon, ω
v1/Rat [30,51] and for the low
ones, ω
1 [51, 78] the role of inelastic channels is negligibly small compared with the
elastic BrS in the case of electron scattering, while for the positron-atom collision the
situation is the opposite. It occurs mainly because of the diﬀerence in the behaviour of
the interference between the ordinary and polarizational amplitudes in inelastic BrS. The
interference is negative in the case of the electron projectile and positive in the positron
case. The simplest way to trace this eﬀect is to consider the inelastic BrS amplitude (8)

in the limit of high photon frequencies, as was done above for elastic BrS. For ω
polarizational inelastic amplitude reduces to f (m)

this result in (8) one notices that for a projectile electron (e =

polarizational terms cancel each other out, while for a positron (e = +1) the eﬀect is
opposite.

To conclude this part of the paper we review the theoretical approaches used to

Polarizational bremsstrahlung in non-relativistic collisions

describe the BrS process in non-relativistic collisions. These can be subdivided into
three parts: (a) methods applied to analyze the scattering process, (b) models used to
describe the interaction with the photon, and (c) the approximations used to describe
the dynamic atomic response.

The variety of theoretical approaches used to describe the scattering process range
from the ﬁrst-order plane-wave Born approximation to more sophisticated ones. Since
the OBrS phenomenon has much longer history these methods were ﬁrst tested in
application to this process and later on were used in the PBrS problem. In application
to the BrS problem in electron–atom scattering the models beyond the plane-wave Born
approximation, used in both the non-relativistic and the relativistic domains include
the corrections due to the Elwert factor and its modiﬁcations [120, 129, 130], the use
of Sommerfeld-Maue functions [114, 129], the approaches based on the use of classical
[131, 132] and semi-classical [99, 100] theories. The best available results have been
obtained using the distorted partial-wave expansion of the projectile wavefunction. This
scheme has been applied to study the ordinary BrS process of non-relativistic projectiles
in the dipole-photon approximation [133, 134]. The most adequate description of the
process has been obtained by applying the DPWA and using the multipole expansion
for the projectile-photon interaction operator [135–138].

In many papers on the PBrS problem the non-relativistic Born approximation was
used for both light (a positron, an electron) and heavy (a proton, an ion) projectiles.
Although the range of validity of the Born approximation for PBrS is larger than for
OBrS, to obtain more accurate data on the total BrS cross sections of a light projectile it
is necessary to go beyond this scheme. Therefore, the non-relativistic DPWA formalism
was developed [26,27,60,139,140] and applied to calculate the cross sections dσ and d2σ
over a broad spectral range [61,63,71–73,77,119] for non-relativistic electrons scattered
on many-electron atoms. The partial-wave approach was also used to study the PBrS
process of slow electrons [18, 19, 141, 142].

In most of the papers the dynamic atomic response to the joint actions of the ﬁeld
of the projectile and of the radiation ﬁeld was treated within the frame of the non-
relativistic dipole-photon theory (with exception for several papers mentioned below).
Even within this framework the accurate calculation of the generalized polarizability
α(ω, q) is not a simple task. Apart from the case of a hydrogen atom (or hydrogen-
like ion) where the analytical evaluation is possible [11, 40, 77] one has to use more
sophisticated approaches to calculate this quantity. The methods known to us include
the the Hartree-Fock based calculations with [22, 24, 25, 60–63, 66, 72] and without
[26] the inclusion of many-body corrections, the approach based on the local-density
approximation (see [100] and references therein). Another semi-empirical approach for
eﬀective and quite accurate calculation of α(ω, q) for complex systems was proposed
recently [66–68]. This method as well as the approach [69] based on the use of the
non-relativistic Coulomb Green function and valid for the calculation of α(ω, q) in the
vicinities of K- and L-shells are described in sections 3 and 4.

Beyond the dipole-photon approximation the PBrS was considered in collisions of a

Polarizational bremsstrahlung in non-relativistic collisions

13

non-relativistic heavy projectile with many-electron atom [29, 37, 38, 143, 144]. In these
papers the corrections of the order kRat ≪
1 were considered and it was demonstrated
that they lead to the additional modiﬁcation of the angular distribution of the radiation.
More systematic analysis of the non-dipolar corrections has become available recently
within the framework of the full relativistic description of the PBrS process [85, 86].

In what follows we discuss in some more the formalism related to the PBrS problem
and present the results of numerical calculations of the BrS spectrum to illustrate the
main features of the process described above.

In this section we consider the case of electron–atom scattering. An adequate

is obtained by using the distorted partial-wave approximation (DPWA) [26,140]. In the

The only characteristic in (15) and (18) which depends on the internal dynamics
of the target is the generalized polarizability. However, it is exactly the calculation of
this quantity which brings a main diﬃculty in the case of a many-electron target, where
an accurate account for many-electron correlations is essential.
In [66–68] a simple
approximate method was introduced for the calculation of α(ω, Q) and consequently
of dσpol(ω). This method allows one to avoid the rather complicated direct numerical
computations of the many-electron correlation eﬀects.
In short, the method can be
described as follows. Let us deﬁne a function G(ω, q) equal to the ratio α(ω, q)/αd(ω)
of the exact generalized and dipole polarizabilities:

α(ω, q) = αd(ω) G(ω, q) .

(19)

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

Polarizational bremsstrahlung in non-relativistic collisions

15

Now let us assume that all the information about the many-electron correlation
eﬀects is contained in the dipole polarizability α(ω), while the factor G(ω, q) is not that
sensitive to them and can be calculated in the simpler approximation, for example within
a Hartree-Fock scheme. Then, instead of (19) one can write the following approximate
formula:

α(ω, q)

αd(ω)

≈

αHF(ω, q)
αHF(ω) ≡

αd(ω) GHF(ω, q) .

(20)

This relation is the key to the method. The approximate equality in (20) reduces
a complex problem of the exact computation of α(ω, q) to a much simpler one: the
calculation of the factor GHF(ω, q) in the Hartree-Fock approximation. In the papers
[60,61,66–68] the validity of this method was checked against more rigorous calculations
(carried out within various RPA-based schemes) of α(ω, q) and dσpol(ω) for electron
scattering on Ba, La, Eu. The BrS spectrum was calculated in the vicinity of the 4d-
subshells ionization potentials where the polarizational mechanism leads to the powerful
maximum in the spectrum. Recently this approach was used in [119] to calculate, in a
broad range of photon energies, the total BrS spectra in e−-Kr and e−-La collisions. In
the cited paper the function G(ω, q) (more exactly, its inverse Fourier image, G(ω, r))
was calculated, following [96], within the local spin density approach.

Another eﬀective method for the approximate calculation of α(ω, q) in the ω-range
close to the ionization thresholds of the K- and L-shells of many-electron atoms was
introduced in [69].
It is based on the use of the Coulomb Green function and the
hydrogen-like wave functions for the inner shell electrons. In more detail this method is
described in section 4.

As was mentioned in section 2 the computation of the dynamic response of the
target is simpliﬁed considerably if one uses the ‘stripping’ approximation. The latter
within the DPWA scheme can be introduced as follows [74]. Using the arguments which
lead to (7), one divides the atomic electrons into two groups, the ‘inner’ and the ‘outer’
Iin,
electrons, following the rule Iout < ω < Iin. Assuming the strong inequality ω
one can neglect the contribution of the virtual excitations of the inner electrons to the
sum in (13). Then, the amplitude fpol can be approximated by the contribution of the
outer-shell electrons alone:

of the ionization thresholds. Such a behavior is totally due to the contribution of the
polarizational, dσpol(ω), as well as the interference, dσint(ω), terms to the total BrS
spectrum.

The total cross section was obtained from eqs.

(16)-(18). The calculate the
generalized polarizability α(ω, q) for each value of ω and q we used the random-phase
approximation with exchange [111] accounting for the virtual excitations from all atomic
subshells. In this sense we may say that the solid lines represent the the ‘exact’ dσtot(ω).
The powerful maxima in vicinity of the 3p and 3s subshells in the case of Ar,
ω = 20 . . . 40 eV, and the 4d and 4p subshells for Xe, ω = 80 . . . 110 eV, appear mainly
due to the contribution of the dipole excitations from these subshells to α(ω, q) and have
essentially collective nature. (This is also true for ω
I5p, I5s in ﬁgure 3 but in this
case the maxima are much less pronounced.) The most part of the intensity radiated in
these maxima comes from the imaginary part of α(ω, q), i.e.
is directly related to the
corresponding maxima in the photoionization cross section (see the discussion in the
paragraph containing eq. (4)). This conclusion becomes more evident if one compares,
in these ω ranges, the ‘exact’ BrS spectra with those obtained within the ‘stripping’
approximation, the dotted lines. Within the framework of the ‘stripping’ approximation,
eqs. (21) and (22), the imaginary part of the PBrS amplitude is ignored. Meanwhile, it is
exactly the imaginary part of fpol which is related to the cross section of photoionization
(see (15) and then eqs. (2) and (4)). Therefore, the discrepancy between the solid and
.
the dotted curves in the vicinity of maxima is largely due to the contribution of Im
Apart from the resonant regions the ‘stripping’ approximation reproduces quite
(cid:17)
well the behaviour of the ‘exact’ curves. The saw-like character of the dotted curves
at the thresholds clearly illustrates the physics which is behind this approximation.
Namely, for ω larger than an ionization potential I the total BrS cross section increases,
because the atom is ‘stripped’ by a total number N of the electrons in the subshell, and,
therefore, the ﬁeld acting on the projectile is stronger than in the case ω < I. In the
formal terms the increase in the cross section is due to the change of the sign of the
interference term dσint(ω) as ω passes through the threshold: dσint(ω) is negative for
ω < I and positive beyond the threshold. These arguments explain also the additional
asymmetry of the giant resonances in the BrS spectrum and that in the spectrum of
photoionization: in the former case the positiveness of the term dσint(ω) slows down the
decrease of the peak.

In ﬁgure 4 the dependences dσpol(ω) are presented for ω lying in the region of the
giant resonances associated with the excitations from the 4d subshells in Ba, La and
Eu. The incoming electron energy is ε1 = 250 eV.

This ﬁgure illustrates two main features of the polarizational BrS. The ﬁrst one,
already mentioned, is the close relationship between the giant resonances in dσpol(ω)
and those in σγ. We note, however, that in general case, the quantity σγ associated
with the photoabsorption process rather than with the photoionization one alone.
The former accounts not only for the ionization into the continuum but the discrete
excitations as well. In those cases when excitations into the continuum dominate in the

photoabsorption spectrum the maximum of σγ lies above the ionization threshold and
so does the maximum of dσpol(ω). In connection with ﬁgure 4 this is true for Ba and
La, and does not hold in the case of a Eu atom. For the latter is is known [146] that
the main oscillator strength of the 4d subshell is associated with the discrete transition
4d

4f. Therefore, the maxima of σγ and dσpol(ω) are located below I4d.
The solid lines in ﬁgure 4 were obtained within the DPWA scheme with the partial
amplitudes of PBrS computed from (18). The dashed lines correspond to fpol within the
Born approximation (see eq. (1)). In both cases to calculate the generalized dynamic
polarizability we used the RPAE with relaxation scheme [111] for Ba and La, and the
spin-polarized RPAE [147] for Eu.

→

It is seen that for incident energies as low as 250 eV the Born approximation gives
almost the same result as the DPWA. The reason for this coincidence lies in the fact that,
in contrast to the process of ordinary BrS, polarizational radiation is formed mainly at
large distances, r
p1/ω, between a projectile and an atom [18,21], where the distorting
inﬂuence of the atomic potential on the projectile’s movement is comparatively small.
Hence, to calculate the polarizational component of the BrS spectrum, one may use the
Born approximation, which results in the formula

can be evaluated with much less eﬀorts than its analogue within the DPWA scheme.

The further step in simplifying the theoretical analysis of the polarizational part of
the spectrum is to use the approximation (20) for the generalized polarizability. Then,

the results are close. Figure 5 illustrates this for the collision of a 250 eV electron
with Ba. The discrepancy between the solid curve, corresponding to (24) with α(ω, q)
calculated within the RPAE, and the short-dashed one, representing (25) where the
correlations were accounted for in the factor αd(ω) only, is almost negligible. For the
sake of comparison, we also present the polarizational cross section calculated via (24)
but with α(ω, q) obtained in the Hartree-Fock approximation (dotted curve).

Another possibility to deduce α(ω, q) is to combine (20) with (4). Provided the
dependence σγ(ω) is known over a suﬃciently wide ω-region one can restore the real
part of αd(ω) from the dispersion relation. Such a way of obtaining α(ω, q) is especially
useful when direct calculations are diﬃcult to perform (for example, when the BrS

process is investigated in a dense media rather that in a pure ‘one electron – one atom’
collision).

To illustrate this approach in ﬁgure 6 the experimentally measured emission spectra
for 500 eV electrons on La [117] are compared with the theoretical results [63, 68]. The
experiment was carried out with the metallic La, therefore, the use of α(ω, q) (or αd(ω))
calculated for an isolated La atom seems not a fully adequate approach. To avoid this
problem in [68] the experimental data for the photoabsorption spectrum [148, 149] was
used to calculate the dynamic dipole polarizability, which then was substituted into
(25). The factor GHF(ω, q) was calculated in the Hartree-Fock approximation. The
experimental data [117] have no absolute scale, so it was normalized to the magnitude
of theoretical curve at the maximum. The background radiation, i.e. the ordinary BrS,
was subtracted from the measured spectrum. Therefore, the experimental curve in the
ﬁgure represents by itself a sum of the polarizational and the interference terms.

The agreement between the two curves is quite good. The main discrepancy is
seen on the right wing of the spectrum where the experimental curve lies higher than
the calculated one. This discrepancy may be attributed to the contribution of the
interference term which was omitted in the calculations.

4. BrS in collisions of heavy particles.

In this section we present the formalism and the results of numerical calculations of the
BrS spectra formed in a collision of two heavy particles. We restrict ourselves to the
case of ‘fast’ collisions, when the translational motion of the colliders can be described
by plane waves. The peculiar features of the BrS formed in slow collisions, and, in
particular, its relationship to the well-known molecular orbital radiation, are discussed
in [75].

Let us describe in short the formalism which allows one to calculate the BrS
spectrum formed in fast non-relativistic collisions of two atomic particles. Following
the papers [34, 35], where such a problem was solved for the ﬁrst time, we consider
the general case when both colliders, a projectile and a target, have internal dynamic
structure. In what follows we use the term ‘atom 1’ for a projectile, and ‘atom 2’ for a
target.

state. We assume that both atoms before and after the collision are in their grounds

This general formula generalizes the result of the Born approximation in application
to the structureless charged particle scattering on a many-electron target, see (1).
The right-hand side of (31) reduces to that of (1) if one considers α1(ω, q) = 0 and
F1(ω, q) = 0. In this limit the ﬁrst term in (31) reduces to ford, whereas the second one
reproduces the PBrS amplitude.

Another feature which we would like to note in connection with (31) is the vanishing
of the total BrS amplitude in the collision of two identical particles. Indeed, in this case
the moduli of both terms are equal and the minus sign leads to f = 0. This is not
surprising if one recalls that (31) corresponds to the dipole-photon approximation, in
whose framework any system of identical particles (no matter how complex they are)
does not radiate. This restriction does not hold beyond the dipole approximation. The
most rigorous treatment of the BrS problem in the non-dipolar domain should also
include the consideration of the relativistic eﬀects. The formalism describing the BrS
radiation in relativistic collisions of atomic particles can be found in [39].

It was mentioned in section 2 that for the same initial velocity of the intensity of
the BrS formed in the collisions of a heavy particle with a many-electron atom can be
comparable or even higher that that in the electron-atom collision. To illustrate this we
included ﬁgure 8 where the dependences dσ/dω are presented for the collisions e−+Xe,
α+Xe and He+Xe for the range of photon energies in the vicinity of the ionization
potential of the 4d subshell in Xe, I4d = 73.4 eV. All curves correspond to the initial

The most striking feature clearly seen in the ﬁgure is that in the whole spectral
interval the magnitude of dσ/dω for the collision α+Xe exceeds that formed in the
collision e−+Xe. The qualitative explanation of this eﬀect is as follows.
In the
collision e−+Xe both channels, the ordinary and the polarizational, contribute to the
amplitude/spectrum. The amplitude of the process is described by (1) where one uses
m = 1 and e = 1.

Therefore, the polarizational part of the spectrum for an α-particle is approximately
four times larger than the PBrS of an electron. In the latter case, however, there are
contributions of the terms dσord and dσint which reduce the discrepancy.

Another important feature which is illustrated by the ﬁgure is that the intensity
of the radiation in collision of a neutral and compact He atom with Xe is, in the order
of magnitude, equal to that for α- and e−-Xe collisions. This is totally due to the
polarizational BrS which appears as a result of virtual polarization of Xe during the
collision.

In the case of a heavy charged structureless projectile the ordinary BrS can be
neglected (the ﬁrst terms in (1 and in the brackets in (32)) and the spectrum is deﬁned
by the polarizational channel only. In this case (32) reduces to

Various methods of calculation of the generalized polarizability α(ω, q) in the ω-
regions in vicinities of the ionization potentials of the atomic subshells as well as in the
I1s have been already discussed above in the paper. Here we want to mention

dynamic response in the photon energy range corresponding to the ionization potentials

the main contribution to the polarizational BrS cross section. The method is based
on the use of the non-relativistic Coulomb Green’s function (see, e.g. [150]) and the
hydrogen-like wave functions for the inner shell electrons calculated in the ﬁeld of the
eﬀective nucleus charge Zeﬀ. The main diﬃculty in the description of the many-electron
system in terms of the single electron hydrogen-like wave functions consists in the correct
accounting for the Pauli principle. In the cited paper it was demonstrated that the Pauli
principle can be taken into account by using the subtraction procedure, which cancels
the electron transitions from the ground state to the occupied atomic levels. Hence,

26

(35)

Polarizational bremsstrahlung in non-relativistic collisions

within the framework of this approach the exact generalized polarizability α(ω, q) of the
inner subshell with quantum numbers n and l (the principal and the orbital quantum
numbers) is approximated as follows:

Here ˜αnl(ω, q) is the generalized dynamic polarizability of the nl-state but calculated

from the condition Inl = Z 2
eﬀ/2n2, i.e. the ionization potential is approximated by the
corresponding hydrogen-like value, or one may crudely put Zeﬀ = Z in the case of the
K-shell electrons. The quantities n′ and l′ on the right-hand side of (35) are the quantum
numbers of the occupied subshells in the many-electron atom the transition to which is
allowed by the dipole selection rules but is forbidden by the Pauli principle. Hence, each
term ˜αnl→n′l′(ω, q) corresponds to the contribution to ˜αnl→n′l′(ω, q) due to the discrete
(n′, l′). To meet the Pauli principle all these terms must be
dipole transition (n, l)
→
subtracted from ˜αnl(ω, q).

The total polarizability of the atom is the sum of all αnl(ω, q). The approximation
(35) fails for the subshells which exhibit a strong correlated reaction to the action of an
external ﬁeld. For such subshells the model of independent electrons is inapplicable.
In contrast, the dynamics of electrons in the inner shells (K- and/or L-shells) is
mainly governed by the action of the ﬁeld of nucleus which outpowers the inter-
electron correlations. Therefore, the substitution of the exact polarizability αnl(ω, q)

potentials of the K- and L-shells are well-separated. Therefore, if one is interested in
the magnitude of α(ω, q) in the range, for example, ω

contribution of all the shells but K to the generalized polarizability and to approximate

In ﬁgures 9 and 10 we present the results of calculations of the PBrS cross
sections in vicinities of the K-shell ionization potentials Na and Ar atoms. Full curves
represent the polarizational BrS cross section (34) α(ω, q) obtained in the Hartree-Fock
approximation. Dotted curves represent the PBrS cross section calculated with the
use of the hydrogen-like polarizability ˜α1s(ω, q) which does not take into account the
Pauli principle (see 35). For each target the eﬀective charge Zeﬀ was chosen from the
condition Zeﬀ = Z. The comparison of dotted and solid curves shows that the cross
sections obtained in the Hartree-Fock and the purely hydrogen-like approximations have
the same order of magnitude but do not agree well enough.

The discrepancy between the two models becomes less pronounced if one takes into
account the Pauli principle. The results of the calculation of the PBrS cross sections in
this case are plotted as broken curves which, as it is seen from the ﬁgures, reproduce
the behaviour of the Hartree-Fock cross sections reasonably well. The discrepancy
between the two approaches is comparable with the accuracy of the Hartree-Fock
method itself. The deviation of the hydrogen approximation from the Hartree-Fock

K-shell. Shifting of the hydrogen-like ionization potential of the K-shell occurs due
to the inter-electron interaction. This phenomenon can be taken into account within
the frame of the hydrogen-like model by choosing the value of Zeﬀ from the condition

eﬀ/2 instead of Zeﬀ = Z (I1s is the Hartree-Fock ionization potential of the
K-shell). The PBrS cross sections calculated with this values of Zeﬀ are shown in ﬁgures
by chained curves. The ﬁgures demonstrate that the imaginary continuation of the
chained curves smoothly matches the broken curves in the vicinity of the hydrogen-like
ionization potential. This means that the hydrogen-like approach provides a simple and
eﬀective method for the PBrS cross section calculations applicable over the whole range
of photon energies above the ionization potentials of the inner atomic shells.

A similar peculiarity, known as the Bethe ridge, appears in the diﬀerential cross section
of the impact ionization of an atom by a charged particle [124], where there is a ridge in
the dependence of the cross section on the transferred momentum q and the momentum
of the outgoing electron pe at q
pe. This ridge in the diﬀerential cross section is a result
of the momentum transfer to one of the target electrons in the collision process. The
peculiarity in the polarizational BrS process arises from the similar dynamics of atomic
electrons [79]. However, in this process after virtual excitation the atomic electron
returns to its initial state radiating a photon. The Bethe-type virtual excitations of
electrons in the PBrS process give rise to the additional maximum in the velocity
dependence of the cross section.

Let us brieﬂy outline the reasons which lead to the Bethe peculiarity in the velocity
dependence of dσpol(ω, v1) (the details are given in [79]). The cross section dσpol(ω, v1),
deﬁned in (34), depends on the generalized polarizability α(ω, q), which (in the case of
a spherically-symmetric target) can be written as follows:

α(ω, q) =

intermediate state energy εn is maximal if εn = q2/2. This means that the momentum is
mainly transferred to the electron in the intermediate state. Similar behaviour of matrix
elements is known from electron–atom impact ionization where it is called ‘the Bethe
ridge’. In the PBrS process the Bethe peculiarity results in the relationship between the
photon energy and the transferred momentum:

where I is the ionization potential of the subshell from which the electron is excited.
This relation deﬁnes the curve in the plane (ω, q) in the vicinity of which the generalized
polarizability α(ω, q) as a function of q has a resonance character. This is illustrated by
ﬁgure 11.

In [79] it was demonstrated that the resonant-like behavior of

results in
the peculiarity (a maximum) in the PBrS cross section dσpol(ω, v1) as a function of
v1. The Bethe peculiarity is mostly pronounced if the velocity and the photon energy
(ω + I)/2 < √2ω which ensures that the elastic PBrS
satisfy the conditions v1 ∼

dominates over the inelastic one in the total emission spectrum, and, consequently, that
the contribution of inelastic channels does not smear out the peculiarity.

Figure 12 illustrates this eﬀect. The maximum in the total emission spectrum (the
solid curve) formed in p+Al collision is due to the maximum of dσpol(ω, v1) as a function
of the velocity. In the vicinity of maximum the contribution of the inelastic channel (the
dashed curve) is small.

5. Conclusions

This review was focused on the achievements made during last decade in the
development of the theory of polarizational BrS formed in non-relativistic collisions
of various particles with isolated many-electron atoms. Apart from what has been
described above in the paper we would like to mention that a number of algorithms
and computer codes have been developed, which allows one to perform an accurate
quantitative analysis of the spectral and spectral-angular distributions of the total BrS
formed in an arbitrary collision process which involves a charged structureless particle
and a multi-electron complex (including molecules and clusters [90]).

However, not all of the problems related to the PBrS eﬀect have been equally
developed. Among these we mention the process of inelastic BrS, the non-dipolar eﬀects,
the role of PBrS in low-energy electron/positron–atom scattering.

The main physical reason for paying less attention to the process of inelastic BrS is
that, as it was mentioned, in wide ranges of photon energies and collision velocities the
contribution of the inelastic channels is parametrically smaller then that of the elastic
BrS due to the coherence nature of the latter. However, the level of accuracy which can
be achieved, at present, in the quantitative description of the inelastic BrS, especially
in the case of electron-atom scattering, cannot be matched with that achieved for the
elastic BrS process. An accurate study of the inelastic radiative scattering is a more
diﬃcult problem both from theoretical and computational points of view. Therefore
there exist fewer in this ﬁeld. Particular interest can be attached to the understanding
of collective excitations in inelastic radiative scattering.

The discussions and numerical calculations of the PBrS beyond the dipole-photon
approximation have not been as extensive as those based on the dipole-photon scheme.
The non-dipolar eﬀects include two aspects. The ﬁrst one is related to the emission into
higher multipoles. Its relative signiﬁcance, which is governed by the magnitude of the
factor kRat (k = ω/c is the momentum of the photon), increases with the photon energy
ω. Therefore, if one is interested in the accurate data on the PBrS characteristics in the
range of photon energies higher than several keV, the corrections to the dipole-photon
approximation must be accounted for. The non-dipolar eﬀects manifests themselves
in PBrS also via the retardation in the interaction between the projectile and the
target’s electrons. The retardation modiﬁes the Coulomb interaction adding the terms
proportional to v1/c (v1 is the velocity of the projectile). These terms become noticeable
for electrons of kinetic energy of several tens of keV. We note that within this energy

Polarizational bremsstrahlung in non-relativistic collisions

range the latest experiments on the detection of PBrS were performed [59]. Both of
these eﬀects, the emission into higher multipoles and the retardation, are incorporated
in the full relativistic theory of PBrS developed recently [85, 86].

Finally, we mention the problem of the role of PBrS mechanism in a low-energy
(ε1 < I1) electron–atom collision. In this case the polarization of the target can inﬂuence
the radiation process not only via the PBrS mechanism directly but in a less evident
way. Namely, the dynamically induced dipole moment may lead to the modiﬁcation of
the projectile’s wavefunction (more precisely, the phaseshifts). This will inﬂuence the
amplitude of the ordinary BrS. This eﬀect, which will be mostly pronounced for the
targets with large dipole polarizabilities, has not been studied in detail so far.

The above described processes do not cover all the phenomena which are worth
to be investigated further. The polarizational BrS problem is rather broad, because
this kind of radiation can be emitted in any collision involving structured particles:
nuclei, atoms, molecules or clusters. The number of various colliding pairs, diﬀerent
interaction forces between particles, kinematical conditions and the frequency ranges
make this problem quite varied and interesting.

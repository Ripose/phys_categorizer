A method of sideband Raman cooling to the vibrational ground state of the m = 0 Zeeman
sublevel in a far-detuned two-dimensional optical lattice is proposed. In our scheme, the Raman
coupling between vibrational manifolds of the adjacent Zeeman sublevels is shifted to the red side-
band due to the ac Stark eﬀect induced by a weak pump ﬁeld. Thus, cooling and optical pumping
to m = 0 is achieved by purely optical means with coplanar cw laser beams. The optical lattice and
cooling parameters are estimated in the framework of simple theoretical models. An application of
the transverse sideband cooling method to frequency standards is discussed. Coherent population
trapping for the sideband Raman transitions between the degenerate vibrational levels is predicted.

Laser-cooled atoms play a critical role in modern frequency standards such as atomic fountains [1]. As is well-known,
Sisyphus-type cooling in optical molasses with polarization gradients results in atoms with temperatures corresponding
to tens of the single-photon recoil energies εr = (¯hk)2/2M (for example, T
3µK in the case of Cs [2]).
Even lower temperatures can be achieved by velocity-selective methods [3–5]. These methods, however, require more
complicated technical implementations [4].

Recently, Poul Jessen and co-workers [6] demonstrated an elegant and eﬃcient method of cooling atoms to the
vibrational ground state of a far-oﬀ-resonance two-dimensional optical lattice. Their method is a variant of Raman
sideband cooling [7] based on transitions between the vibrational manifolds of adjacent Zeeman substates. A static
magnetic ﬁeld is used to tune the Zeeman levels so that Raman resonance occurs on the red sideband and results
in cooling. Two circularly polarized ﬁelds are then used to recycle the atoms for repetitive Raman cooling. The
cooling operates in the Lamb-Dicke regime with cw laser beams and does not require phase-locked lasers; a transverse
temperature of about 950 nK was achieved.

Unfortunately, Jessen’s scheme is diﬃcult to apply to frequency standards for several reasons. First, atoms are
accumulated in the stretched m = F substate of the F = 4 ground-state hyperﬁne level of Cs. For clock applications
it would be necessary to transfer atoms from

principle, this can be realized by the adiabatic passage technique [8]. Second, in the cooling scheme of Ref. [6] a static
300 mG is used to produce the required energy shift of the Zeeman substates and,
magnetic ﬁeld in the range 100
consequently, additional shielding of the Ramsey region of the clock is necessary. Finally, and most critically, the
geometry of the cooling scheme requires pumping and repumping beams propagating orthogonal to the cooling plane
and these would, when present, produce unwanted light shifts for atoms in the Ramsey region.

Stimulated by the concepts and results from Jessen [6], we propose a new variant of transverse sideband cooling, that
avoids problems mentioned above, while maintaining most of the attractive features. In the present scheme, only cw
lasers lying in the cooling plane are used. The basic diﬀerence from the method of Ref. [6] is that the linearly polarized
pumping ﬁeld now plays a two-fold role, both providing optical pumping back to the m = 0 magnetic sublevel and
causing a uniform ac Stark shift that replaces the external magnetic ﬁeld induced Zeeman shift in [6]. The lattice
and cooling parameters are studied in the framework of simple theoretical models. The optimal magnitudes of the
Raman transition amplitude, the pumping ﬁeld intensity, and the detuning are found. These results are conﬁrmed
F ′ = F transition. Apart from these, we ﬁnd
by numerical calculations for a more realistic model of the cycling F
that coherence between degenerate (or nearly degenerate) lower vibrational levels can lead, under certain conditions,
to signiﬁcant changes in the cooling eﬃciency and cooling time.

The proposed cooling method may also be useful for atom optics as a high-brightness well-collimated source of

atoms, or for general purposes of quantum-state control in a non-dissipative optical lattice.

The ﬁeld conﬁguration used for the optical lattice consists of three linearly polarized beams having equal amplitudes
and propagating in the xy-plane with angles of 2π/3 between each other (Fig. 1). The polarization vectors of these
beams are tilted through a small angle φ with respect to the z-axis. This ﬁeld can be written as

In other words, contrary to the ﬁeld conﬁguration of Ref. [6], all the Zeeman sublevels have the same optical shift.
For red detunings ∆ < 0, the minima of the potential (3) form a lattice consisting of ideal triangles with a side 2λ/3
(one of them has the coordinates x = y = 0).

In the general case, the atomic motion in a periodic potential leads to a band energy structure. However for
potentials with a periodicity of the order of the light wavelength λ and with the depth much larger than the recoil
energy εr (6us in the case under consideration), both the tunneling probability and the width are exponentially small
for bands close to a potential minimum. Hence, instead of a lattice and energy bands we can consider vibrational levels
as arising from independent potential wells. The spectrum of the lower levels can be deﬁned, with good accuracy,
from the harmonic expansion in the vicinity of the well’s bottom:

where X and Y are the displacements from the minimum. This expansion corresponds to a 2D isotropic harmonic
oscillator with the frequency ¯hωv = √12usεr. Due to the isotropy, the n-th energy level is n + 1 times degenerate.
If the energy separation between adjacent vibrational levels is much greater than the recoil energy, the characteristic

Two other important requirements for eﬃcient Raman sideband cooling are a spatially independent energy shift of
the magnetic sublevels and optical pumping. To achieve these, we propose to use another optical ﬁeld, known as the
pump beam, linearly polarized along the z-axis, propagating in the cooling plane, and detuned by several Γ to the

eventually pumped into this target state. Thus, the described cooling method can be viewed as a version of dark-state
cooling. It is seen that the cooling scheme in the case under consideration is somewhat diﬀerent from that of Ref. [6].
To make sure that there are no real constraints and to estimate the cooling parameters, we consider a simple
theoretical model of the double Λ-system (see Fig. 2.b), which allows an analytical treatment of the problem.
We have found the steady-state solution of the generalized optical Bloch equations involving the light-induced and

Calculations within the framework of the double Λ-system give α = 8 and β = 28. Such a dependence of the cooling
rate on γp and UR can be understood qualitatively if we consider cooling as optical pumping into the dark state.

In principle, two factors limit the number of vibrational levels which participate in eﬃcient cooling: both the
anharmonicity and the violation of the Lamb-Dicke regime become appreciable for higher vibrational levels. The
second factor is the more stringent limitation and gives the following estimate for the maximal vibrational number:

It should be noted that in the case of a symmetric ﬁeld conﬁguration for 2D and 3D lattices a degeneracy of
the vibrational energy structure occurs. For a 2D lattice (for example the ﬁeld conﬁguration of Ref. [6] and our
conﬁguration) in the harmonic approximation, the n-th vibrational level contains n + 1 sublevels

We ﬁnd that the coherence induced between the degenerate or near-degenerate vibrational levels can play an important
role, signiﬁcantly changing the eﬃciency of the Raman coupling. Indeed, if we consider two degenerate levels, for
example,
coupled by Raman transitions with the unique state

, for which the operator of the Raman transitions is equal to zero, as it is for the

light-induced Λ-chains [14]. However, it should not be forgotten that for higher vibrational levels the anharmonicity
has to be taken into account and the degeneracy is partly violated. In the scheme under consideration, this unwanted
coherence eﬀect is avoided by the simultaneous Raman coupling of the two degenerate states

with diﬀerent amplitudes, in such a way that the conditions for

purposes, for instance in quantum state preparation.

In order to provide the cycling interaction of atoms with the pump ﬁeld, repumping from the other hyperﬁne level
F ′ = F + 1 transition of the D2

line. This beam is linearly polarized along ez and runs in the xy-plane. For example, if the pumping ﬁeld operates

D2 line. To minimize eﬀects of optical pumping on the other hyperﬁne level, the intensity of the repumping ﬁeld can
be chosen close to the saturation intensity. It is noteworthy that in our lattice the potentials for both hyperﬁne levels
have the same spatial dependence and, consequently, the requirement on the repump intensity is not so stringent as
in Ref. [6].

Concluding, we have proposed a new scheme for 2D Raman sideband cooling to the zero-point energy in a far-oﬀ-
resonance optical lattice. The main distinguishing features of our proposals are the use of the pumping ﬁeld to shift
the Raman coupling to the red sideband and the accumulation of cold atoms in the m = 0 Zeeman sublevel. An
elementary theoretical consideration allowed us to state the basic laws for the cooling eﬃciency and for the cooling
dynamics. Our estimates for Cs show that as much as 95% of atoms can be accumulated in the

state within the millisecond time range. This corresponds to a kinetic temperature of order of 100 nK after adiabatic
release from the lattice [15]. A non-dissipative optical lattice can be eﬀectively loaded through the four-stage process,
as has been demonstrated in Ref. [6]. Also, coherent population trapping for the sideband Raman transitions between
degenerate vibrational levels is predicted.

FIG. 2. (a) Scheme of sideband Raman cooling. The Raman transitions are shown by angle arrow lines. The transitions
induced by the pumping ﬁeld (solid lines) and spontaneous transitions (dashed lines) provide the back relaxation to the
|m = 0, n = 0i state. The Zeeman sublevels are shown optically shifted. (b) Simple double Λ-system model.

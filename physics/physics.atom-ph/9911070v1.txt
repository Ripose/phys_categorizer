The exact solution to the Schr¨odinger equation for the rigid body with the
given angular momentum and parity is obtained. Since the quantum rigid
body can be thought of as the simplest quantum three-body problem where
the internal motion is frozen, this calculation method is a good starting point
for solving the quantum three-body problems.

Key words: quantum three-body problem, rigid body, Schr¨odinger equation.

1. INTRODUCTION

The three-body problem is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics,
which has not been well solved. The Faddeev equations [1] provide a method
for solving exactly the quantum three-body problems. However, only a few
analytically solvable examples were found [2]. The accurate direct solution
of the three-body Schr¨odinger equation with the separated center-of-mass
motion has been sought based on diﬀerent numerical methods, such as the
ﬁnite diﬀerence [3], ﬁnite element [4], complex coordinate rotation [5], hy-
perspherical coordinate [6-8], hyperspherical harmonic [9-11] methods, and a
large number of works [12-16]. In those numerical methods, three rotational
degrees of freedom are not separated completely from the internal ones. In
this letter we present a method to separate completely the rotational degrees
of freedom and apply it to the quantum rigid body as an example.

The plan of this letter is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we shall introduce
our notations and brieﬂy demonstrate how to separate the rotational degrees
of freedom from the internal ones in a quantum three-body problem. The
exact solution to the Schr¨odinger equation for the rigid body with the given
angular momentum and parity is obtained in Sec. 3. A short conclusion is
given in sec. 4.

2. QUANTUM THREE-BODY PROBLEM

Denote by rj and by Mj, j = 1, 2, 3, the position vectors and the masses of
three particles in a three-body problem, respectively. The relative masses are
Mj. The Laplace operator
mj = Mj/M , where M is the total mass, M =

P

−1
in the three-body Schr¨odinger equation is proportional to
j △rj ,
where △rj is the Laplace operator with respect to the position vector rj.
Introducing the Jacobi coordinate vectors x and y in the center-of-mass
frame,

Lx = −i¯hx × ▽x,

Ly = −i¯hy × ▽y.

(2)

The three-body Schr¨odinger equation with the separated center-of-mass mo-
tion becomes

{△x + △y} Ψ + V Ψ = EΨ,

(3)

where V is a pair potential, depending only upon the distance of each pair
of particles.

In the hyperspherical harmonic method [11], for example, two Jacobi

coordinate vectors are expressed in their spherical coordinate forms,

−

(cid:17)

x ∼ (ρ cos ω, θx, ϕx),

y ∼ (ρ sin ω, θy, ϕy).

(4)

where ρ is called the hyperradius and Ω(ω, θx, ϕx, θy, ϕy) are the ﬁve hyper-
angular variables. The wave function is presented as a sum of products of a
hyperradial function and the hyperspherical harmonic function,

Ψℓm(x, y) =

ψK,ℓxℓy (ρ)Y ℓm

K,ℓxℓy (Ω).

XK,ℓxℓy

There is huge degeneracy of the hyperspherical basis, and the matrix ele-
ments of the potential have to be calculated between diﬀerent hyperspherical
harmonic states [10], because the interaction in the three-body problem is
not hyperspherically symmetric.

The quantum rigid body (top) can be thought of as the simplest quantum
three-body problem where the internal motion is frozen. To solve exactly the
Schr¨odinger equation for the rigid body is the ﬁrst step for solving exactly
the quantum three-body problems. Wigner ﬁrst studied the exact solution
for the quantum rigid body (see P.214 in [17]) from the group theory. He
characterized the position of the rigid body by the three Euler angles α, β,
γ of the rotation which brings the rigid body from its normal position into
the position in question, and obtained the exact solution for the quantum
rigid body, which is nothing but the Wigner D-function. For the quantum

2

three-body problems, as in the helium atom, he separated three rotational
degrees of freedom from three internal ones (see Eq. (19.18) in [17]):

Ψℓm(r1, r2) =

Dℓ

∗
mν(α, β, γ)

ψν (r1, r2, ω),

(5)

ν
X

where r1 and r2 are the coordinate vectors of two electrons, ω is their an-
gle, and the Wigner D-function form [17] has been replaced with the usual
D-function form [18]. Wigner did not write the three-body Schr¨odinger equa-
tion explicitly. As a matter of fact, the three-body Schr¨odinger equation (3)
becomes very complicated if one replaces two coordinates vectors of electrons
with the Euler angles as well as r1, r2, and ω for the internal motion. On
the other hand, Wigner’s idea, to separate the degrees of freedom completely
from the internal ones, is helpful to simplify the calculation for the quan-
tum three-body problem. Hsiang and Hsiang in their recent paper [19] also
presented the similar idea. In this letter we will develop the idea of Wigner
and obtain the exact solution of the Schr¨odinger equation for the rigid body
without introducing the Euler angles directly. This calculation method is a
good starting point for solving the quantum three-body problems [19,20].

The Schr¨odinger equation (3) is spherically symmetric so that its solution
can be factorized into a product of an eigenfunction of the angular momen-
tum L and a ”radial” function, which only depends upon three variables,
invariant in the rotation of the system:

ξ1 = x · x,

ξ2 = y · y,

ξ3 = x · y.

(6)

For the quantum rigid body, the potential makes the internal motion frozen
so that those variables ξj are constant.

For a particle moving in a central ﬁeld, the eigenfunction of the angular
momentum is the spherical harmonic function Y ℓ
m(θ, ϕ). How to generalize
the spherical harmonic function to the three-body problem without intro-
ducing the Euler angles directly? As is well known, Y ℓ
m(θ, ϕ),
where (r, θ, ϕ) are the spherical coordinates for the position vector x, is a
homogeneous polynomial of degree ℓ with respect to the components of x,
which does not contain r2 = x · x explicitly. Y ℓ
m(x), called the harmonic
polynomial in the literature, satisﬁes the Laplace equation as well as the
eigen-equation for the angular momentum.

m(x) = rℓY ℓ

In the three-body problem there are two Jacobi coordinate vectors x and
y in the center-of-mass frame. We shall construct the eigenfunctions of the
angular momentum as the homogeneous polynomials of degree ℓ with respect
to the components of x and y, which do not contain ξj explicitly. According
to the theory of angular momentum [18], they are

Y ℓq

Lm(x, y) =

µ(x)Y ℓ−q
Y q

m−µ(y)hq, µ, ℓ − q, m − µ|q, ℓ − q, L, mi,

0 ≤ q ≤ ℓ, when L = ℓ, and 1 ≤ q ≤ ℓ − 1, when L = ℓ − 1.

µ
X

(7)

where hq, µ, ℓ − q, m − µ|q, ℓ − q, L, mi are the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients.
The remained combinations with the angular momentum L < ℓ − 1 contain

3

the factors ξ3 explicitly [20]. In other words, the eigenfunctions of the total
angular momentum L2 with the eigenvalue ℓ(ℓ+1), not containing the factors
ξj explicitly, are those homogeneous polynomials of degree ℓ or degree (ℓ+1).
Let us introduce a parameter λ = 0 or 1 to identify them:

△xy, and the parity with the eigenvalues ℓ(ℓ + 1), m, q(q + 1), (ℓ − q +
λ)(ℓ − q + λ + 1), 0, 0, 0, and (−1)ℓ+λ, respectively, where L2 and L3 are
the total angular momentum operators, L2
y are the ”partial” angular
momentum operators [see Eq. (2)], △x and △y are the Laplace operators
respectively with respect to the Jacobi coordinate vectors x and y, and △xy
is deﬁned as

x and L2

Because of the conservation of the angular momentum and parity, the
solution Ψℓmλ(x, y) of the Schr¨odinger equation (3) can be expanded in
terms of Y (ℓ+λ)q
(x, y), where the conserved quantum numbers ℓ, m and λ
are ﬁxed. Since those equations are independent of m, we can calculate them
by setting m = ℓ, where [18]

By substituting Ψℓℓλ(x, y) into Eq.

This system of the partial diﬀerential equations was ﬁrst obtained by Hsiang
and Hsiang [19]. It is a good starting point for solving the quantum three-
body problems [19,20].

3. QUANTUM RIGID BODY

For the quantum rigid body, the potential preserves the geometrical form of
the rigid body ﬁxed. It can be replaced by the constraints:

ξ1 = const.

ξ2 = const.

ξ3 = const.

(13)

Therefore, the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation for the quantum rigid
body can be expressed as

ℓ

Ψℓℓλ(x, y) =

q Qℓλ
f ℓλ

q (x, y).

(14)

Xq=λ
q are constant. Recall that Qℓλ

where f ℓλ
q (x, y) is the solution of the Laplace
equation. Due to the constraints (13) some diﬀerential terms with respect to
ξj in the Laplace equation should be removed so that the Laplace equation
is violated, namely, the rigid body obtains an energy E. On the other
hand, as a technique of calculation, we can calculate those diﬀerential terms
ﬁrst where ξj are not constant, and then set the constraints (13). The
contribution from those terms is nothing but the minus energy −E of the
rigid body.

In the calculation, we ﬁrst separate the six Jacobi coordinates [see Eq.
(4)] into three rotational coordinates and three internal coordinates. The
lengths of x and y and their angle ω are

rx =

ξ1,

ry =

ξ2,

cos ω = ξ3/

ξ1ξ2.

Obviously, those three variables are also constant in the constraints (13).
Assume that in the normal position of the rigid body the Jacobi coordinate
vector x is along the Z axis and y is located in the XZ plane with a positive
X component. A rotation R(α, β, γ) brings the rigid body from its normal
position into the position in question. The Euler angles α, β, and γ describe
the rotation of the rigid body. The deﬁnition for the Euler angles are diﬀerent
[17]) because x and y here are
from that of Wigner (see Eq. (7) and Ref.

the Jacobi coordinate vectors. To shorten the notations, we deﬁne

cα = cos α,
cx = cos θx,
sα = sin α,
sx = sin θx,

cβ = cos β,
cy = cos θy,
sβ = sin β,
sy = sin θy,

cγ = cos γ,
C = cos ω,

sγ = sin γ,
S = sin ω.

According to the deﬁnition, we have [18]

R(α, β, γ) =





cαcβcγ − sαsγ

x1 + ix2 = rxeiαsβ,

Through the replacement of variables:

we obtain

α = ϕx,
C = cxcy + sxsy cos(ϕx − ϕy),

Due to the spherical symmetry, the energy level with the given total
angular momentum ℓ is (2ℓ + 1)-degeneracy (normal degeneracy). Further-
more, since λ ≤ q ≤ ℓ, there are (ℓ+1) sets of solutions with the parity (−1)ℓ
and ℓ sets of solutions with the parity (−1)ℓ+1. This conclusion coincides
with that by Wigner (see P. 218 in [17]). When ℓ = 0 we have the constant
solution with zero energy and even parity. When ℓ = 1, we have one set of
solutions Ψℓm1 with the even parity and two sets of solutions Ψℓm0 with the
odd parity:

It is similar to obtain the solutions with the higher orbital angular momen-
tum ℓ. The partners of the solutions with the smaller eigenvalues of L3 can
be calculated from them by the lowering operator L−.

4. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have reduced the three-body Schr¨odinger equation for any
given total orbital angular momentum and parity to a system (12) of the
coupled partial diﬀerential equations with respect only to three variables,
describing the internal degrees of freedom in a three-body problem. This
equation system is a good starting point for solving the quantum three-body
problems. As an example, we obtain the exact solution to the Schr¨odinger
equation for the rigid body.

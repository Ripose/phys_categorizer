realistic helium-helium interaction models. We describe the properties of ground and excited states,

INTRODUCTION

Helium atom is one of the simplest few-body systems. Nowadays, its structure can be described theoretically with
an accuracy better than the spectroscopy one [1]. In spite of this simplicity, the compounds of Helium atoms display
a series of unique microscopic and macroscopic physical phenomena.

The closed shell electronic structure, as well as the compactness of the Helium atom, makes it the most chemically
inert noble gas. Nevertheless, the very weak van der Waals attraction between two distant He atoms is responsible
for the fact that at very low temperatures, both bosonic 4He and fermionic 3He liquify. In addition, the extreme
weakness of the He-He interaction is decisive in explaining why liquid Helium is the only known superﬂuid.

As much exciting is the physics of the atomic Helium nanoscopic structures (He multimers). Recent inspiring
experiments [2, 3] have demonstrated the existence of bound diatomic 4He systems (dimers) - the ground state with
the weakest binding energy of all naturally existing diatomic molecules. Moreover, diﬀraction experiment projecting
a molecular beam of small He clusters on nanostructured transmission gratings, allowed a direct measurement of the
4 ˚A. Such a large bond, compared to the eﬀective range of the He-He
dimer average bond length value < R >= 52
0.2 mK, as well as the 4He-4He
potential, enables one to estimate its binding energy E
scattering length a0 = 104 + 8/

≈
The extreme weakness of the 4He dimer binding energy requires a precise theoretical description of the ab initio
He-He potential, which results from subtracting the huge energies of separated atoms. Nevertheless, several very
accurate theoretical models [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] were recently constructed, predicting Helium properties in full agreement
with experiments. These eﬀective He-He potentials are dominated by the strong repulsion (hard-core) at distances
He . 2 ˚A, where the two He atoms are ”overlapping”. At larger He-He distances, the weak van-der-Waals
RHe
attraction takes over, creating a shallow attractive pocket with a maximal depth of V0 ≈
≈
3˚A. The strong repulsion of the He-He potential at short distance, allows to treat accurately atomic He systems without
having to take into account the internal structure of single He atoms.

The physics of small He clusters is an outstanding laboratory for testing diﬀerent quantum mechanical phenomena.
The bound state of 4He dimer, at practically zero energy, suggests the possibility of observing an Eﬁmov-like state in
the triatomic compound [10]. The existence of this 4He dimer bound state very close to threshold, is also responsible
104 ˚A, which is more than 30 times larger than the typical length
for a resonant 4He-4He S-wave scattering length a0 ≈
3˚A. The small He clusters low energy scattering observables should
scale given by the Van der Waals interaction l
therefore be little sensitive to the details of He-He interaction and should thus exhibit some universal behavior. This
sharp separation of diﬀerent scales can be exploited, making He multimers a perfect testground for Eﬀective Field
Theory (EFT) approaches [11, 12, 13, 14].

∼

We present in this work a rigorous theoretical study of the smallest 4He clusters. There exist in the literature a
large number of theoretical calculations on triatomic 4He (trimer) [15, 16, 17]. However the four-atomic 4He system
(tetramer), being by an order of magnitude more complex in its numerical treatment, remains practically unexplored.

Our study tries to ﬁll up this gap, by providing original calculations for tetramer bound and scattering states. In
addition, some existing ambiguities in triatomic 4He calculations [18] are discussed.

To describe 4He tetramer, Faddeev-Yakubovski (FY) equations in conﬁguration space are solved. In some cases, this
method may be cumbersome and numerically expensive. It constitutes nevertheless a very general and mathematically
rigorous tool, with the big advantage over many other techniques, that it enables a systematic treatment of bound
and continuum states.

The paper is structured as follows: in section II we present the theoretical framework used; in section III we highlight
our 4He trimer results. Section IV deals with four-atomic helium systems and in section V, we discuss the possible
existence of the rotational states in three-atomic and four-atomic4He systems. Section VI concludes this work with
the ﬁnal remarks.

To describe the interaction between the helium atoms, we have used the potential developed by Aziz and Slaman [4],
popularly referred to as LM2M2 potential. There exists several equivalent interaction models. However, they all have
similar structure and quantitatively provide very close results [17, 19].

All results presented in this paper are restricted to the bosonic 4He isotope; therefore in the following, we omit the

mass number 4 and refer to 4He as He. All calculations use ~2

m = 12.12 K

˚A2 as the input mass of He atoms.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

A. Faddeev-Yakubovski equations

The Schr¨odinger equation is the paradigm of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. However this equation is not able
to separate diﬀerent rearrangement channels in the asymptote of multiparticle wave function (w.f.). Thus it does not
provide explicitly a way to implement the physical boundary conditions for scattering w.f., which are necessary to
obtain a unique solution. Faddeev [20] have succeeded to show that these equations can be reformulated by introducing
some additional physical constraints, what leads to mathematically rigorous and unique solution of the three-body
scattering problem. Faddeev’s pioneering work was followed by Yakubovsky. In [21], the systematic generalization of
Faddeev equations for any number of particles was presented.

One should mention that Schr¨odinger equation may still be applied when solving few-particle bound state problem.
However then one must deal directly with total systems w.f., which is fully (anti)symmetric and has quite complicated
structure. Exploiting the knowledge of systems symmetry one often tries to decompose this w.f. into only partially
(anti)symmetrized components, which had simpler structure and are more tractable numerically. One practical way
is to decompose systems w.f.
into so called FY components. Then FY equations often have obvious advantage
over Schr¨odinger one, since it deals directly only with FY components by avoiding construction of full system wave
function.

In that follows, we describe only four-particle FY equations; three-particle Faddeev equations are self-contained in

four-particle ones.

FIG. 1: Faddeev-Yakubovsky components K and H. Asymptotically, as z → ∞, components K describe 3+1 particle channels,
whereas components H contain asymptotic states of 2+2 channels.

The calculations presented in this work were performed using the framework of diﬀerential FY equations developed
by S.P. Merkuriev and S.L. Yakovlev [22, 23]. The major step in these equations is the representation of the systems
w.f. as a sum of 18 components: 12 of type K, describing the asymptotic behavior of diﬀerent 3+1 particle channels,
and 6 of type H, describing the systems decomposition into two clusters of two particles:

Here (ijkl) indicates cyclic permutation of particle indices (1234). These FY components are coupled by 18 FY
equations. Since all particles are identical, several straightforward symmetry relations can be established between
diﬀerent FY components. Using these relations, the number of independent FY equations and components reduces
to two:

Here P + = P12P23, P − = P23P12 and ˜P = P13P24 are particle permutation operators. ˆH0 is the kinetic energy
operator of the system and ˆV is the potential energy operator for the particle pair (12). The coeﬃcient ε is a Pauli
factor: ε = 1 for bosonic systems and ε =

1 for systems of identical fermions.

By applying combination of permutation operators to the FY components of Eq. (1), one can express the w.f. of

the system by means of two non-reducible FY components:

It is convenient to treat Eq. (2) using relative reduced coordinates. These coordinates are proportional to well
known Jacobi coordinates, which are simply scaled by the appropriate mass factors. We use two diﬀerent sets of
relative reduced coordinates, deﬁned as follows:

type FY components. mi and −→r i are respectively the i-th particle mass and position vector. To describe

type components, another set of coordinates is more appropriate:

Using these coordinates, the kinetic energy operator is expressed as a simple sum of Laplace operators:

Another big advantage of these coordinate sets is the fact that the degrees of freedom due to the center of mass motion
are separated.

The dimension of the problem can be further reduced by using the fact that an isolated system conserves its total
angular momentum
z. We deal with systems of bosonic He atoms in their ground state,
which have a total spin equal to zero. In this case, the system w.f. is independent of the spin and the orbital angular
momentum is conserved separately. Using this fact, we expand FY components on a partial-wave basis (PWB) of
orbital angular momentum and, omitting the spin:

In Eq. (7), we have introduced the so called FY amplitudes

H
α (x, y, z), which are continuous
functions in radial variables x,y and z. The symmetry properties of the w.f. with respect to the exchange of two He
atoms impose additional constraints. One should have amplitudes only with an even value of the angular momentum
lx, whether these amplitudes are derived from K or H FY components.

By projecting each of the Eq. (2) to the PWB of Eq. (7), a system of coupled integro-diﬀerential equations is
obtained. In general, PWB is inﬁnite and one obtains thus an inﬁnite number of coupled equations. This obliges
us, when solving these equations numerically, to make additional truncations by considering only the most relevant
amplitudes, namely those which have the smoothest angular dependency (small partial angular momentum values
lx, ly and lz).

−

B. Boundary conditions

Equations (2) are not complete: they should be supplemented with the appropriate boundary conditions for FY
components. It is usual to write boundary conditions in the Dirichlet form, which at the origin should mean vanishing
FY components. However, the existence of a large strong repulsion region (hard-core) corresponding to the inner part
of He-He potential brings additional complications. The relevant matrix elements from the physical interaction region
(shallow attractive well) fade away in front of the huge repulsive hard-core terms, thus resulting in severe numerical
instabilities.

However, such a strong repulsion at the origin simply indicates that two He atoms cannot get arbitrarily close
to each other:
for a repulsive region of characteristic size rh, the probability that two particles get closer to each
other at a certain distance r = c < rh will be vanishingly small. It means that the w.f. of the system vanishes in
part of a four-particle space, inside six multidimensional surfaces rij = c, where rij is the distance between particle
i and j. The most straightforward way to improve numerical stability would be to avoid calculating the solution in
at least part of the strong repulsion region, and to impose by hand to the wave function to be equal to zero in this
region. Nevertheless, due to the complex geometry of this domain in the nine-dimensional space of particle relative
coordinates, this method is not easy to put in practice.

A nice way to overcome this diﬃculty was proposed by Motovilov and Merkuriev [24]. The authors showed that an
inﬁnitely repulsive interaction at rij 6 c, generates boundary conditions for the FY components which can be ensured
by setting:

In addition, FY components asymptotic behavior should be conditioned as well. For the bound state problem, the

w.f. of the system is compact, therefore the regularity conditions can be completed by forcing the amplitudes
to vanish at the borders of the hypercube [0, Xmax]

In the case of elastic atom-trimer (1+3) scattering, the asymptotic behavior of the w.f. can be matched by simply
imposing at the numerical border z = Zmax, the solution of the 3N bound state problem for all the quantum numbers,
corresponding to the open channel αa. It worths reminding that only K-type components contribute in describing
3+1 particle channels:

Indeed, below the ﬁrst inelastic threshold, at large values of z, the solution of Eq. (2) factorizes into a He trimer
ground state w.f. – being solution of 3N Faddeev equations – and a plane wave propagating in z direction with the
momentum kαa =

EHe3 ). One has:

Here the functions f K

αa(x, y) are the Faddeev amplitudes obtained after solving the corresponding He trimer bound
state problem, whereas EHe3 is its ground state energy; ˆnlz (kαa z) and ˆjlz (kαa z) are regularized Riccati-Bessel func-
tions. Equations (2) in conjunction with the appropriate boundary conditions deﬁne the set of equations to be solved.
The numerical methods employed will be brieﬂy explained in the next subsection.

Once the integro-diﬀerential equations of the scattering problem are solved, one has two diﬀerent ways to obtain
the scattering observables. The easier one is to extract the scattering phases directly from the tail of the solution, by

calculating logarithmic derivative (

) of the open channel’s K amplitude αa in the asymptotic region:

We use piecewise Hermite polynomials as a spline basis. In this way, the integro-diﬀerential equations are converted
into an equivalent linear algebra problem with unknown spline expansion coeﬃcients to be determined. For bound
states, the eigenvalue-eigenvector problem reads:

where A and B are square matrices, while E and x are respectively the unknown eigenvalue(s) and its eigenvector(s).
In the case of the elastic scattering problem, a system of linear algebra equations is obtained:

Ax = EBx,

[A

EcmB] x = b

−

where x is a vector of unknown spline expansion coeﬃcients and b is an inhomogeneous term, generated when
implementing the boundary conditions Eq. (11). For detailed discussions on the equations and method used to solve
large scale linear algebra problems, one can refer to [26].

III. TRIMER SCATTERING AND BOUND STATES

As mentioned in the introduction, trimer states have been broadly explored in many theoretical works. Hyperspheri-
cal, variational and Faddeev techniques were used to calculate accurately bound state energies [16, 17, 19, 27, 28, 29, 30]

as well as to test diﬀerent He-He interaction models. Nevertheless, we found useful to consider these states as a ﬁrst
step, before the more ambitious analysis of He tetramer states could be undertaken. Special emphasis will be at-
tributed to He-He2 scattering calculations, which are less studied and for which some discrepancies were pointed
out [18, 19]. Some arguments will also be developed in favor of considering the ﬁrst trimer excitation as an Eﬁmov
state.

We present in Table I the convergence of the He trimer states as a function of the partial-wave basis size. It contains
results for the ground (B3) and ﬁrst excited (B∗3 ) state binding energies as well as for the He-He2 scattering length
(a(1+2)
). The basis truncations were made by limiting partial angular momentum values, applying selection criteria

lx = ly
lmax. One can remark that the convergence is monotonic and quite similar for the He3 bound states and
for the He-He2 scattering length calculations. These results demonstrate that in order to ensure ﬁve digit accuracy,
the partial wave basis must include FY amplitudes with angular momentum values up to 12. However, for reaching
a 1% accuracy, lmax = 4 turns out to be enough.

The situation is more ambiguous for the He-He2 scattering length a0. Results obtained by Sandhas et al. [16] –
solving Faddeev equations – and Blume et al. [29] – using hypherspherical harmonics – agreed with each other on
a scattering length value a0 = 126 ˚A. However Roudnev [18], using also Faddeev equations, found a smaller value
0.1 ˚A. It seems that in Sandhas et al. [16] calculation a relatively small grid was employed, which did
a0 = 115.4
not allow to disentangle the contribution of virtual dimer break-up component in the asymptotic behavior of the wave
0.5 ˚A, in full agreement with
function. A more recent study [19] of the same authors provided a value of a0 = 115.5
Roudnev’s result.

Our calculations are also very close to this value. When using a numerical grid limited to ymax = 450 ˚A we
obtain a0 = 134 ˚A, still far from the ﬁnal result. Note that hyperradial grids employed in [16] were limited to
x2 + y2=460 ˚A. The results of Table I have been obtained using a grid with ymax = 950 ˚A, i.e. He-He2

Whether or not the trimer ﬁrst excitation is an Eﬁmov [10] state has been an issue of strong polemics [32, 33]. In
fact, when using eﬀective range theory and describing system by zero-range interactions, it is not diﬃcult to show
the appearance of an Eﬁmov state. However, the problem becomes complicated in calculations with ﬁnite range
potentials. Eﬁmov states accumulate according to a logarithmic law

23 (or the dimer binding
and thus the two body scattering length should be each time increased by a factor
energy reduced
530 times) to allow the appearance of an additional Eﬁmov state. To handle this property, the
grids employed in calculations should be extremely large and dense, capable on one hand to accommodate extended
wave functions, and on the other hand to trace the very weak binding of the third particle to the dimer. Such
requirements can not be fulﬁlled in the calculations with realistic interactions. Thus the basic clue in claiming
excited trimer to be an Eﬁmov state is the fact that this state disappears when the interatomic potential is made less
attractive [15, 34, 35]. Actually, if this potential is multiplied by an enhancement factor γ > 1 then the following
eﬀect is observed: ﬁrst, the diﬀerence between the trimer excited state binding energy (B∗3 ) and the dimer one (B2)
B2) monotonously decreases and for γ >1.2 trimer
increases with γ. Then, for larger values of γ the diﬀerence (B∗3 −
excited state moves below the dimer threshold and becomes a virtual one.

The demonstration of Eﬁmov eﬀect can be accomplished only by showing accumulation of new states when dimer
binding energy decreases. Such a demonstration has been given in ref. [36] using semi-empirical potential HFD-
B [6]. We would like to remark that the formation of new states can be alternatively demonstrated by studying
the γ-dependence of the three-body scattering length, without the necessity of solving the bound state problem. In
scattering calculations, the numerical solution of 3-body equations can be reduced to the interaction domain and the
wave function extended outside this region using analytical expressions [37].

In ﬁgure 3 we display the behavior of the He-He2 scattering lengths, when the He-He potential is multiplied by a
scaling factor γ < 1, according to ˜V = γV . In this ﬁgure, the He-He2 scattering length is plotted as a function of the
ﬁctive dimer binding energy. One can see that, when decreasing γ – scattering length decreases. However in absence
of Eﬁmov states one should expect them increasing, since reducing γ, the dimer target becomes larger. Once γ is

IV. TETRAMER STATES

The major aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the four-atomic He compound (tetramer).
The ﬁrst eﬀorts to describe this system were made already in the late seventies by S. Nakaichi et al. [38] using a
variational method. Latter on, variational Montecarlo techniques were used by several authors [29, 39, 40, 41] to
compute the tetramer ground state. These methods are very powerful in calculating LΠ = 0+ bound state properties,
but are seldom generalized to describe excited states and are not appropriate for scattering problem.

FY techniques were also used by S. Nakaichi et al. [42] to calculate the tetramer ground state binding energy
and the He-He3 scattering length. However in order to reduce the – at that time – outmatching numerical costs,
some important approximations were made. The He-He potential was restricted to S-wave and written as a one-rank
separable expansion and the same expansion was used to represent the FY amplitudes. These approximations led
to a tetramer ground state which is underbound by 40% with respect to their own variational result [38]. A recent
attempt to calculate the He tetramer binding energy using S-wave FY equations was done in [43], although without
separable expansion of FY amplitudes.

The FY calculations we present here contain no approximation other than the ﬁnite basis set used in the partial
wave expansion (7). This basis set included amplitudes with internal angular momentum not exceeding a given ﬁxed
lmax. The largest basis we have considered has lmax =8, and
value lmax, i.e. fulﬁlling the condition max(lx, ly, lz)
consist of 180 FY amplitudes, a number by two order of magnitude larger than in preceding calculations. Note, that
the smallest basis, which is often referred to as S-wave approximation, is obtained by ﬁxing lmax = 0 and requires
only 2 amplitudes, one of type K and one of type H. The convergence is displayed in Table III for the tetramer ground
state binding energy and He-He3 scattering length.

The convergence of the tetramer calculations is sensibly slower than the one observed for the trimer case (see
Table I). Such a deterioration is due to the complex structure of the involved FY components. Indeed, each He
atom pair brings an additional hard-core region; the ensemble of these regions crosses over in the multidimensional
conﬁguration space [48] and results into a single domain with non trivial geometry.
Inside this multidimensional
domain, the total wave function must vanish by cancelling the contributions of the diﬀerent FY amplitudes, what can
be achieved only at the price of increasing its functional complexity.

The convergence of the He-He3 scattering calculations is also slightly slower than for tetramer ground state. This
is a consequence of the scattering wave function, which presents a richer structure than the ground state one, as
can be seen in Figure 4. Tetramer ground state has a rather simple geometry: the four He atoms minimize their
126 mK) is considerably
total energy by forming a tetrahedron. The total energy of the 1+3 scattering state (E
larger than the ground state one (E
558 mK) and provides more ﬂexibility to each atom. Furthermore, since
the scattering length value is much larger than the size of the trimer target, the scattering wave function turns to be
strongly asymmetric.

≈ −

≈ −

Despite these diﬃculties, the PW basis we have used enables to reach rather accurate results: the tetramer ground
state binding energy is converged up to 0.4%, while the ﬁnal variation of the scattering length does not exceed 2%.
Our best result for the ground state binding energy of He4, B=558 mK, is in perfect agreement with the B=559(1)
mK value, provided by several variational Monte-Carlo techniques [29, 39, 40].

It is interesting to compare the bound state result with the eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT) predictions. It follows
from this approach that systems governed by large scattering lengths should exhibit universal properties. The wave
functions of such systems have very large extensions with only a negligible part located inside the interaction region.
The detailed form of the short-range potential does not matter, since the system probes it only globally. It should

10

be therefore possible to describe its action using only few independent parameters (physical scales). One scale is
obviously required, to ﬁx the two-body binding energy or the scattering length. Keeping ﬁxed the two-boson binding
energy, the three bosons system would collapses if the interaction range tends to zero, a collapse known as the Thomas
eﬀect [44]. This indicates that three-body system is sensitive to an additional scale, which can be determined by ﬁxing
one three-body observable (for instance the 3-particle binding energy or the 1+2 scattering length) [45, 46].

It seems [14] that the four-boson binding energies remains ﬁnite if none of its three-boson subsystems collapse.
Furthermore four- and three-body binding energies are found to be correlated [14]. The simplest way to establish such
a correlation law is by using contact interactions. In this way, the two-body binding energy is ﬁxed by the parameter
strength of zero-range two-body force, whereas the three-body collapse is avoided and its binding energy is ﬁxed by
introducing repulsive three-body contact term. Using this model Platter et al. [14] demonstrated that inside quite
a large domain of dimer-trimer binding energy ratio (B2/B3), the correlation between tetramer and trimer binding
energies is almost linear. In the same study, a numerical approximation of this correlation law was obtained.

If we take our dimers (BHe2 = 1.30348 mK) and trimers binding energies as the scales for EFT with contact
interaction, one obtains a tetramer binding energy of 485 and 491 mK respectively, depending on which trimer energy
– ground or excited – is used. This result is only by 13% smaller than our most accurate result.

One should remark that the EFT scaling laws are derived using contact interactions, which act only in S-wave.
Therefore it would be more consistent to compare our values obtained using S-wave approximation (lmax = 0). In
this case, the EFT formulas give respectively BHe4 = 330 mK and 325 mK depending on which trimer ﬁxes the scale.
These values must be compared with our result BHe4 = 348.8 mK, i.e. EFT is only by 6% oﬀ.

The good agreement between exact and EFT results, proves the great prediction power of the last approach. EFT
works surprisingly well even beyond its natural limit of applicability: systems with a size signiﬁcantly exceeding the
range of interaction. Note, indeed, that the He tetramer and trimer ground states are rather compact objects, in
which the interatomic separation is about

10 ˚A, and therefore comparable with He-He interaction range

3 ˚A.

Let us discuss now the He-He3 scattering results. Nakaichi et al. [42], using S-wave separable expansion of the
116 ˚A. Using the same HFDHE2
outdated HFDHE2 potential, obtained a large and negative scattering length a0 =
potential and restricting to lmax=0 amplitudes we have got also a negative, although much larger, scattering length
-5600 ˚A. This result is however very unstable, as a consequence of the lmax=0 basis inability to describe
value a0 ≈
the non-trivial behavior of the FY components in the hard-core region. If we add max(ly, lz)
4 amplitudes, the
-898 ˚A for the same HFDHE2 interaction model limited to S-wave. Similar calculations
scattering length reduces to
-450 ˚A. As one can see in Table III, the full potential must be used in order to
with the LM2M2 potential give a0 ≈
obtain converged results. The presence of He-He interaction in higher partial waves cardinally changes the physics
of He tetramer: not only the size but also the sign of the resonant scattering length changes, thus indicating the
emergence of a new excited state in this compound.

−

≤

≈

Another eﬀort to evaluate He-He3 scattering length was made by Blume et al. [29]. In their work, eﬀective He

Hen
potentials were constructed starting from the same LM2M2 He-He interaction model. Without taking into account
the particle correlations, Blume et al. provided a positive He-He3 scattering length a0=56.1 ˚A.

−

As already mentioned, the large positive scattering length indicates the presence of a tetramer excitation close to
the trimer ground state threshold. Much physics about this tetramer state can be learned by studying the behavior
of the zero energy 1+3 scattering w.f., or what is even more practical, its FY components. These components are
only partially symmetrized and have a more transparent asymptotic behavior [23, 47]. The structure of K-type FY
component displayed in Figure 4, proves that this state is the ﬁrst tetramer excited state: the corresponding open
10 ˚A, i.e.
channel FY amplitudes have two nodes in z, the He-He3 separation direction. The ﬁrst node is situated at

≈

103.7 ˚A,
inside the He3 cluster, indicating the presence of a compact ground state. The second node is situated at
which coincides with the scattering length value. This coincidence is not accidental: at such He-He3 separations, the
single He atom is already out of the interaction domain of the He3 cluster. Close to this node, the FY components
reach the well known linear behavior:

A direct calculation of the He4 excited state represents nowadays a hardly realizable numerical task. This state is
very weakly bound and its wave function very extended. In order to numerically reproduce it, one is obliged to use a
very large and dense grid. On the other hand, one should be able to ensure a high accuracy to trace a small binding
energy diﬀerence. For the time being, it constitutes an insurmountable obstacle in the context of the large computing
power demanding four-body calculations.

Nevertheless the vicinity of tetramers excited state to the He-He3 continuum makes possible the extraction of its
binding energy from the scattering results. A bound state is identiﬁed with a S-matrix Sl(k) pole on the positive
imaginary axis of the complex momentum plane. Since Sl(k) is unitary, its general form close to the pole k = ik0 is:

Sl(k) =

energy parameters. For the He-He3 scattering states with lz = 0, it reads:

It follows from Eq. (20) that in order to obtain the unknown binding energy it is suﬃcient to know the low energy
coeﬃcients a0 and r0. The scattering length value a0 has been already determined and the eﬀective range r0 can be
extracted by ﬁtting with Eq. (19) the He-He3 low energies phase shifts. The corresponding extrapolation procedure
is illustrated in Fig. 5. One can see that inside the considered momentum region, close to k =
, the eﬀective range
expansion works perfectly well. The obtained binding energy, ∆B0 = 1.087mK, should not suﬀer much from higher
order momentum terms in the expansion (19). Nevertheless, the He-He3 eﬀective range is pretty large r0=29.1 ˚A and
inﬂuences signiﬁcantly the extrapolated binding energy value. By ignoring this term, one would get

and a binding energy of only ∆B(0)

0 = 0.751mK will be obtained, i.e. a value by 30% smaller.

We ﬁnally predict the existence of a LΠ = 0+ tetramer excited state with binding energy B∗He4 = ∆B0 + BHe3 =
127.5 mK. This value compares well with the EFT prediction [14] discussed above, which gives the range B∗He4 ∈
[128
130] mK, a dispersion due to the fact that the interpolation was done for the total binding energy and not the
sensibly smaller relative value ∆B0.

−

The validity of the procedure we use to obtain the binding energy of the excited tetramer can be veriﬁed in the
dimer case, for which direct bound state calculations causes no diﬃculty. The procedure is illustrated in Fig. 6. The
accurate dimer binding energy is BHe2 = 1.30348 mK, a value very close to ∆B0 = 1.087 mK, and allows to control
the inaccuracy made when disregarding higher order terms in expansion (19). By considering only two terms in the
expansion (19) we have got BHe2 = 1.3036 mK, only diﬀering in the ﬁfth signiﬁcant digit from the directly calculated
value. In addition, the He-He potential eﬀective range extracted by ﬁtting the low energy phase shift is r0=7.337 ˚A.
This value can be independently calculated applying the Wigner formulae from zero-energy scattering wave function,
which gives r0=7.326 ˚A, in nice agreement with the extrapolated one. Such an agreement demonstrates the validity
of our approach.

It is interesting to compare the eﬀective ranges for He-He, He-He2 and He-He3 systems. They are respectively
r0=7.33, 79.0 and 29.1 ˚A.
It is not surprising that the atom-dimer eﬀective range is the largest one: this is a
consequence of a dimer ground state which is the most extended of the three considered targets. The atom-trimer
eﬀective range is more than a third of the atom-dimer one and is signiﬁcantly larger than the range of the He-He
potential. This suggest that the trimer ground state has a structure with a sizeable probability to ﬁnd a single He
atoms separated by 20-30 ˚A apart from its center.

We can still use the He-He3 scattering w.f. to obtain a relatively good description of the tetramer excited state. In
fact, the left hand side of FY equations 2 for the bound and zero-energy He-He3 state diﬀer only by a small energy
term, which has a little eﬀect on the w.f. inside the interaction region, dominated by large kinetic and potential terms.
These functions sensibly diﬀer only in the He-He3 asymptotes, where they can be described analytically [23, 47] as a
tensor product of a strongly bound trimer in its ground state and a plane wave of the remaining He atom with energy
E-EHe3 . In practice, the two w.f. diﬀer only by FY amplitudes contributing to the open channels. For zero-energy
scattering, one has a linearly diverging open channel FY amplitude as described in Eq. (17). For bound state these
amplitudes converge very slowly with a small exponential factor:

FIG. 7: Coupling scheme for three-particle FY component.

Considering that 4He is a spinless atom, the rotational states of 4He-multimers can be classiﬁed according to their
parity (Π) and total orbital angular momentum (L). FY components are very useful to classify these states as well as
to analyse their properties. As we have mentioned in section II, the lx quantum number must be even (see Fig. 7). It
follows that for He trimer, the LΠ = 0− states are forbidden. Further we classify the He trimer states into those which
can break into dimer and a freely propagating He atom, and those in which dimer states are forbidden by symmetry
requirements. In the ﬁrst group, we have states with LΠ = (1−, 2+, 3−, ...). To be decay stable, these states should
be more bound than dimer. The other group is formed by the LΠ = (1+, 2−, 3+, ...) states, which can only break into
three helium atoms.

Clearly, the 1− is the most promising candidate for a trimer stable rotational state. This state is realized with the
1, and consequently contains the smaller centrifugal terms in the

smallest partial angular momentum, i.e. lx + ly

Hamiltonian. The non-existence of this state would imply the non-existence of other states of the same decay group –
i.e. LΠ = (1−, 2+, 3−, ...) – since they involve larger centrifugal energies: lx + ly
2. The existence of stable trimers
3.
in the second group is very doubtful; the most favorable would be the 2− one, for which one has already lx + ly

≥

In a similar way, we can classify the rotational states of He tetramer (see Fig. 1). In the ﬁrst group, we have states
LΠ = (1−, 2+, 3−, ..) for which the ﬁrst decay threshold is the trimer ground state. The most promising state inside
this group is the 1− one. For this state, the condition lx + ly + lz

1 must be satisﬁed.

In the second group, we have trimer decay stable states LΠ = (1+, 2−, 3+, ..). These states can neither break into
trimer-atom pair nor into two dimers: their reference threshold is dimer plus two free atoms. LΠ = 0− state represents
a special case: it can be broken only into four free atoms.

≥

The FY formalism we are using allows to calculate multiparticle rotational states with the same ease as zero angular
momentum ones. However, none of trimer or tetramer rotational states have been found stable. The non-existence
of weakly bound states can be easily veriﬁed using low energy scattering techniques for trimer and tetramer states in
the ﬁrst decay groups (two cluster). In addition, the calculated scattering length turns out to be an indicator for the
strength of the interaction between the scattered clusters and thus tests if nearthreshold bound or resonant states are
present.

∞

For atom-dimer scattering in 1−, one obtains a large positive scattering length (a1)

3 =114.2 ˚A. If He-He interaction
is changed, this length scales with the dimer size. If we add a small attractive three-body interaction to force a trimer
binding without aﬀecting dimer, this scattering length becomes smaller. In fact, when the attractive three-body force
is weak, this scattering length reduces very slowly. Only when this additional force becomes rather strong, close to
the critical value binding 1− trimer, the scattering length falls down to -
. It crosses a singularity, passing from
-
at the value where 1− trimer bound state appears, and then again stabilizes to large positive value. This
∞
clearly indicates that no trimer rotational state exist with quantum numbers LΠ = (1−, 2+, 3−...). An even much
stronger attractive three-body force is required to bind the second group LΠ = (1+, 2−, 3+, ...) states, thus excluding
the possible existence of bound or even nearthreshold resonant He trimer states.

to +

The case of rotational tetramers is identical to the trimers one. A positive scattering length (a1)

12.28 ˚A is
also obtained for He-He3 scattering with LΠ = 1−. This value is sensibly smaller than the one for 1− atom-dimer
scattering, which simply results from the scaling with the target size. As in trimers case, one has to apply a strong
additional attractive force to reduce this scattering length to -
, i.e. to force the 1− tetramers binding. Tetramers in
the second decay group, as well as LΠ = 0−, seem to be even less favorable: they require an even stronger additional
force to be bound. We conclude therefore that no bound or even nearthreshold resonant states should exist for
tetramers with LΠ

= 0+.

VI. SUMMARY

In this paper, we have outlined Faddeev-Yakubovski equation formalism in conﬁguration space.

It enables a
consistent description of bound and scattering states in multiparticle systems. This formalism was applied to study the
lightest (N = 2, 3, 4) systems of He atoms using realistic He-He interaction. We have presented accurate calculations
for bound He trimer and tetramer states, as well as for low energy atom-dimer and atom-trimer scattering.

Our main results concern the He tetramer states. We have obtained a tetramer ground state binding energy of

B = 558 mK, in perfect agreement with the most accurate variational results.

The ﬁrst realistic calculation of He-He3 scattering length has been achieved, with the prediction a0=104 ˚A. Such

a large value indicates the existence of a tetramer excited state close to the trimer ground state threshold.

Its binding energy can hardly be determined in a direct bound state calculation, due to the diﬃculties in accom-
modating a very extended wave function. We have shown that this energy can be obtained by applying an eﬀective
range expansion to low energy 1+3 scattering states. We predict the existence of a LΠ = 0+ He tetramer excited
state with a binding energy of 127.5 mK, situated 1.09 mK below the trimer ground state.

Finally, we have studied the possible existence of rotational states in three and four atomic He compounds. It has
= 0+) states. The existence of

been shown that neither the He trimer nor the tetramer have bound rotational (LΠ
corresponding nearthreshold resonances is also doubtful.

[48] In two particle case one has single hard-core region in three-dimensional particle space; this region has simply a form of
the sphere of radius rhc placed at the origin. One has three hard-core conditions for three particle system, these regions
are intersecting in six-dimensional multiparticle space. Four particle case already has six hard-core conditions for nine-
dimensional multiparticle space.

In atom optics a material structure is commonly regarded as an amplitude mask for atom waves.
However, atomic diﬀraction patterns formed using material gratings indicate that material structures
also operate as phase masks.
In this study a well collimated beam of sodium atoms is used to
illuminate a silicon nitride grating with a period of 100 nm. During passage through the grating
slots atoms acquire a phase shift due to the van der Waals interaction with the grating walls. As a
result the relative intensities of the matter-wave diﬀraction peaks deviate from those expected for a
purely absorbing grating. Thus a complex transmission function is required to explain the observed
diﬀraction envelopes. An optics perspective to the theory of atomic diﬀraction from material gratings
is put forth in the hopes of providing a more intuitive picture concerning the inﬂuence of the vdW
potential. The van der Waals coeﬃcient C3 = 2.7±0.8 meV nm3 is determined by ﬁtting a modiﬁed
Fresnel optical theory to the experimental data. This value of C3 is consistent with a van der Waals
interaction between atomic sodium and a silicon nitride surface.

It is known that correlations of electromagnetic vac-
uum ﬁeld ﬂuctuations over short distances can result in
an attractive potential between atoms. For the case of
an atom and a surface the potential takes the form

V (r) = −

C3
r3 ,

(1)

where r is the atom-surface distance and C3 is a coeﬃ-
cient which describes the strength of the van der Waals
(vdW) interaction [1]. Equation 1 is often called the non-
retarded vdW potential and is valid over distances shorter
than the principle transition wavelength of the atoms in-
volved. The signiﬁcance of this interaction is becoming
more prevalent as mechanical structures are being built
on the nanometer scale. The vdW potential also plays
an important part in chemistry, atomic force microscopy,
and can be used to test quantum electrodynamic theory.
Early experiments concerning the vdW interaction
were based on the deﬂection of atomic beams from sur-
faces. It was demonstrated that the deﬂection of ground
state alkali [2] and Rydberg [3] atom beams from a gold
surface is compatible with Eq. 1. Later measurements
based on the Stark shift interpretation of the vdW po-
tential [4] were suﬃciently accurate to distinguish be-
tween the retarded V ∼ r−4 and non-retarded V ∼ r−3
forms. More recently atom optics techniques have been
employed to measure the magnitude of the vdW coef-
ﬁcient C3. Various ground state [5] and excited noble
gas [6] atom beams have been diﬀracted using nano-
fabricated transmission gratings in order to measure C3.
The inﬂuence of the vdW potential has also been ob-
served for large molecules in a Talbot-Lau interferometer

constructed with three gold gratings [7].

In this article we present atomic diﬀraction of a ther-
mal sodium atom beam and show that the data cannot
be described by a purely absorbing grating. A diagram of
the experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. The su-
personic beam of sodium atoms passes through a .5 mm
diameter skimmer and is collimated by two 10 µm slits
separated by ∼ 1 m. By changing the carrier gas the
atom velocity can be adjusted from 0.6 to 3 km/s with
σv
v ∼ .1. The collimated atom beam is used to illuminate
a silicon nitride grating [8] with a period of d = 100 nm,
thickness t = 150 ± 5 nm, open width w = 50.5 ± 1.5 nm,
and grating bar wedge angle α = 5.25±.75 degrees. All of
the grating parameters are measured independently us-
ing scanning electron microscope images. The diﬀraction
pattern is measured by ionizing the sodium atoms with
a hot Re wire and then counting the ions with a channel
electron multiplier.

An optical description is helpful in gaining an intuitive
picture of how the vdW interaction modiﬁes the atomic
diﬀraction pattern. To this end one should recall that
the Schroedinger equation for a wave function ψ can be
written as

where n is index of refraction. By inspection one can
see that Eqs. 3 and 4 are formally equivalent where the
1/2
quantities n and
play analogous roles. Due
to this fact many wave propagation methods developed
in optics can be applied directly to matter wave propa-
gation, being mindful of the fact that in optics ω = cko.
While Eq. 3 can be formally solved using a Green’s
function approach, approximate solutions used in physi-
cal optics can lead to a better understanding of how the
vdW interaction aﬀects atomic diﬀraction patterns. The
Fresnel and Fraunhofer approximations are commonly
used in optics and represent a useful tool when faced with
propagating the wave function ψ from the grating to the
detector plane. The Fresnel or paraxial approximation is
valid as long as the propagation distance z satisﬁes the
inequality

z ≫ |x − ξ|.

(5)

This is certainly satisﬁed for our experiment since the
diﬀraction angles are less than 10−3 radians and the or-
ders are resolved. The Fraunhofer or far-ﬁeld approxima-
tion goes beyond the Fresnel approximation by requiring
that

2

setup d = 100 nm and λdB ∼ 10−11 m, so the inequality
z ≈ 2 m ≫ π
1000 m is met. However, our atom beam
diameter is on the order of 10−5 m and so ξmax → 10−5
m implying that the inequality in Eq. 6 is not met.

In light of the previous discussion it seems most ap-
propriate to use the Fresnel approximation to model our
experiment. According to the Fresnel approximation the
wave function in the detector plane ψ(x) is related to
that just after the grating ψ(ξ) by a scaled spatial Fourier
transform

factor in Eq. 7 accounts for the fact that the phase fronts
have a parabolic shape before the far-ﬁeld is reached.

standard Fourier optics notation and convenient due to
its modular nature [11].

From Eq. 10 we can predict the atom intensity

I(x) ≡ |ψ(x)|2 ,

(13)

in the detector plane which can also be interpreted as the
probability law for atoms. A distribution of atom veloc-
ities can be incorporated by a weighted incoherent sum
of the intensity pattern for each atom velocity I (x; v)

where the P (v) is the probability distribution function of
velocities for a supersonic source, u is the average ﬂow
velocity, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the longi-
tudinal temperature of the beam in the moving frame of
the atoms [12].

One can see from Eq. 10 that the diﬀraction pattern
consists of replications of the beam shape |U (x)|2 shifted
by integer multiples of λdB zo
d with relative intensities de-
termined by the modulus squared of Eq. 11. An im-
portant feature to notice in Eq. 11 is that a diﬀraction
order in the detector plane corresponds to a spatial fre-
quency in the grating plane through the relation fξ = j
d .
This highlights the connection between the spatially de-
pendent phase φ(ξ) in Eq. 9 and the magnitude of the
diﬀraction orders in Eq. 10.

The earlier assertion that φ(ξ) in Eq. 9 somehow incor-
porates the vdW interaction into the optical propagation
theory can be understood by recalling from Eq. 3 that
play
the index of refraction n and quantity
similar roles in optics and atom optics, respectively. In
optics one calculates a phase shift φ induced by a glass
plate by multiplying the wavenumber in the material nko
by the thickness of the plate L (i.e. φ = nkoL). Just as
in the optics case one can calculate the phase shift φ(ξ)
accumulated by the wave function passing through the
grating windows

In arriving at Eq. 16 diﬀraction due to abrupt changes

function propagates through the grating windows. This

in the region of the potential that corre-
sponds to the diﬀraction orders of interest. The relation-
ship between spatial regions of the potential V (ξ, z) and
a given diﬀraction order will be discussed in subsequent
paragraphs. It is also important to note that Eq. 16 as-
sumes that the potential V (ξ, z) exists only between the
grating bars (i.e. V (ξ, z) = 0 for z < −t or z > 0) and ne-
glects the fact that the bars are not semi-inﬁnite planes.
Theoretical work done by Spurch et al. [13] suggests that
the vdW potential corresponding to our ∼ 50 nm grating
bar width is very similar to that of a semi-inﬁnite plane
in the ξ direction. Since the phase φ(ξ) from Eq. 16 only
depends on the integral of the potential in the z direction
one would also expect that edge eﬀects in V (ξ, z) due to
the ﬁnite grating thickness t are a small correction.

If the particle energy ~ω is much greater than the po-
tential V (ξ, z) then Eq. 16 can be further simpliﬁed by

through the use of the dispersion relation ω =

p = mv = ~ko. Equation 17 is often called the Eikonal
approximation. The term tko in Eq. 17 is independent of
ξ and of no consequence in Eq. 11 so it can be neglected.
One can see from Eq. 17 that if V (ξ, z) → 0 then Eq.
11 reduces to the sinc diﬀraction envelope expected from
a purely absorbing grating. Furthermore, it is now clear
from Eqs. 11 and 17 that the relative heights of the
diﬀraction orders are altered in a way that depends on
V (ξ, z) as well as the atom beam velocity v.

As a simple model one can represent the potenial in
Eq. 17 as the sum of the potential due to the two interior
walls of the grating window

φ(ξ) = −

where the function g±(α) incorporates the inﬂuence of
the wedge angle α

where t is the thickness of the grating and V (ξ, z) is the
potential the atoms experience between the grating bars
due to the vdW interaction. Thus the vdW interaction
is analogous to a glass plate with a spatially dependent
index of refraction, a kind of diverging lens that ﬁlls each
grating window. The result in Eq. 16 is consistent with
the wave function phase according to the WKB approx-
imation [9].

FIG. 2: Observed diﬀraction patterns of four diﬀerent atom
velocities. The numbers next to the peaks indicate the diﬀrac-
tion order. Molecular Na2 peaks are also visible between ze-
roth and ﬁrst orders for slower velocities.

w(z) = w + 2z tan α. Since the principle transition wave-
length of Na (590 nm) is much larger than w
2 (i.e. the
maximum atom-surface distance of ∼ 25 nm) the non-
retarded form of the vdW potential is appropriate.

It is not immediately obvious how the phase represen-
tation in Eq. 17 will aﬀect the far-ﬁeld diﬀraction pattern
or if the Eikonal approximation is appropriate in light of
Eq. 18 (i.e. V±(ξ) → −∞ as |ξ| → w
In order to
address this it is helpful to introduce the concept of an
instantaneous spatial frequency [14]

In fact, the

to note that using Eqs. 18 and 20 one can solve for the

4 the shape
of the diﬀraction amplitude in Eq. 11 depends on a small
region of the potential near an an atom-surface distance
of ∼ 20 nm.

The experimental data for diﬀraction patterns of four
diﬀerent atom beam velocities are displayed in Fig. 2.
One can see from Fig. 2 that the second order diﬀraction
peak is almost completely suppressed for the faster atoms
whereas it is quite pronounced for the slower atoms. This
velocity dependence is a clear indication that a complex
transmission functions such as Eq. 9 (i.e. C3 6= 0) is
required to explain the data. A least-squares ﬁt to Eqs.
10 and 14 is used to determine diﬀraction envelope |Aj|2
and the average velocity.
It is clear from Fig. 2 that
the diﬀraction orders overlap to some extent, hence the
tails of the beam shape are important when determining
|Aj|2. The broad tails of the beam shape were not ad-
equately described by a Gaussian so an empirical shape
using a ﬁxed collimating geometry was derived from the
measured raw beam proﬁle and used for |U (x)|2.

The diﬀraction amplitudes |Aj|2 determined from Fig.
2 for the various velocities are displayed in Fig. 3. The
vdW coeﬃcient C3 is determined by a least-squares ﬁt
to this reduced data with the modulus squared of Eq.
11. All of the grating parameters are determined inde-
pendently, therefore C3 is the only free parameter. Data
from each velocity is ﬁt simultaneously with the same C3.
It is clear that a purely absorbing grating (i.e. C3 = 0)
is inconsistent with all of the observed |Aj|2 especially at
lower velocities for which the phase φ(ξ) is much larger.

A study of the systematic errors in our experiment and
analysis suggest that w is largest source of uncertainty
when calculating C3. One can numerically calculate the
function C3(w), which is the best ﬁt C3 as a function of w,
whose linear dependence around the physical value of w
w=50.5 nm = .52 meV nm2. The error
is found to be ∂C3
∂w
in C3 is arrived at by taking the product of this slope and
the 1.5 nm uncertainty in w. After carrying out the pre-
viously described analysis we obtain a value for the vdW
coeﬃcient C3 = 2.7 ± 0.8 meV nm3. The uncertainty
determined this way is considerably larger than the sta-
tistical uncertainty in C3 from the least-squares ﬁtting
procedure. The uncertainty due to w is also larger than
the systematic corrections due to the atom beam pro-
ﬁle or uncertainties due to imperfect knowledge of the
grating parameters: d, t, and α.

atoms and various surfaces in Table I. The Lifshitz for-
mula [17] for C3 is

C3 =

~

4π Z

0

ǫ(iω) − 1
ǫ(iω) + 1

,

where α(iω) is the dynamic polarizability of the atom and
ǫ(iw) is the permittivity of the surface material, both of
which are a function of complex frequency.

A single Lorentz oscillator model for an atom (i.e. ne-
glecting all but the valence electron) with no damping
gives an expression for polarizability [18]

α(iω) =

α(0)
1 + ( ω

ω0 )2 .

For sodium atoms α(0) = 24.1 ˚A3 [19] and ω0 =
2πc/(590 nm). Combining this with a perfect conduc-
tor (i.e. ǫ = ∞) in Eq. 23 gives C3 = 6.29 meV nm3.
This value agrees well with the non-retarded limit cal-
culated in reference [16] for sodium atoms with a single
valence electron.

For more accurately modeled sodium atoms and a per-
fect conductor, Derevianko et al. [15] calculated C3 =
7.60 meV nm3 and reported a range of values spanning
0.08 meV nm3 based on diﬀerent many-body calculation
methods which all include the eﬀect of core electrons. It
is noteworthy that 16% of this recommended value is due
to the core electrons [15].

For a metal surface, the Drude model describes ǫ(iω)

in terms of the plasma frequency and damping:

ǫ(iω) = 1 +

ω2
p
ω(ω + γ)

.

(25)

For sodium metal, ~ωp = 5.8 eV and ~γ = 23 meV,
resulting in C3 = 4.1 meV nm3 for a sodium atom
and a bulk sodium surface. Presumably this calcula-
tion also under-estimates C3 because the core electrons
are neglected. However, the calculation error is probably
smaller than that of a perfect conductor because the core
electron excitations are at frequencies comparable to ωp.
For an insulating surface of silicon nitride, which is the
diﬀraction grating material, Bruhl et al [6] used a model
with

ǫ(iω) =

ω2 + (1 + g0)ω2
0
ω2 + (1 − g0)ω2
0

(26)

where ~ω0 ≡ Es = 13eV and g0 = 0.588 is the material
response function at zero frequency. Using Eqs. 23, 24,
and 26 gives a value of C3 = 3.2 meV nm3.

A multilayered surface makes a vdW potential that no
longer depends exactly on r−3, even in the non-retarded
limit. We used Equation 4.10 from reference [13] to
calculate V (r) for thin ﬁlms of sodium on a slab of
silicon nitride. Because our experiment is sensitive to
atom-surface distances in the region 20 nm, we report

the nominal value of C3 from these calculations using
C3 = V (20 nm) × (20 nm)3. Evaluated this way, isolated
thin ﬁlms make a smaller C3 as r increases. Films on a
substrate make C3 vary from the value associated with
the bulk ﬁlm material to the value associated with the
bulk substrate material as r increases.

In conclusion an optics perspective to the theory of
atomic diﬀraction from a material grating has been put
forth. The results in Eqs. 11, 17 and 18 have been derived
using Fourier optics techniques and appear to be consis-
tent with the diﬀraction theory presented in [20]. Diﬀrac-
tion data for a sodium atom beam at four diﬀerent ve-
locities show clear evidence of atom-surface interactions
with the silicon nitride grating. A complex transmission
function such as that in Eq. 9 is required to explain the
data. The measured value of C3 = 2.7 ± 0.8 meV nm3
is limited in precision by uncertainty of the grating pa-
rameter w. Based on the results in Table I for a single
Lorentz oscillator the new measurement of C3 presented
in this article is consistent with a vdW interaction be-
tween atomic sodium and a silicon nitride surface. Our
measurement is inconsistent with a perfectly conduct-
ing surface and also a silicon nitride surface coated with
more than one nm of bulk sodium. This implies that
atomic diﬀraction from a material grating may provide
the means to test the theory of vdW interactions with a
multi-layered surface [13] by using coated gratings.

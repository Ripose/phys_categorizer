We theoretically study the eﬀects of elastic collisions on the determination of frequency standards
via Ramsey fringe spectroscopy in optical-lattice atom clocks. Interparticle interactions of bosonic
atoms in multiply-occupied lattice sites can cause a linear frequency shift, as well as generate
asymmetric Ramsey fringe patterns and reduce fringe visibility due to interparticle entanglement.
We propose a method of reducing these collisional eﬀects in an optical lattice by introducing a phase
diﬀerence of π between the Ramsey driving ﬁelds in adjacent sites. This conﬁguration suppresses site
to site hopping due to interference of two tunneling pathways, without degrading fringe visibility.
Consequently, the probability of double occupancy is reduced, leading to cancellation of collisional
shifts.

INTRODUCTION

Current state-of-the-art atomic clock technology is based mainly on trapped single ions or on clouds of free falling
cold atoms [1]. Recently, a new type of atomic clock based on neutral atoms trapped in a deep “magic-wavelength”
optical lattice, wherein the ground and excited clock states have equal light shifts, has been suggested [2, 3]. For
interfering, far-detuned light ﬁelds, giving rise to a “washboard” intensity pattern, the optical potential experienced
by an atom in a given internal state is V0(r) = ~
2/(4∆0) where Ω0(r) = 2µE0(r)/~ is the dipole coupling
Ω0(r)
|
|
frequency, E0(r) is the radiation electric ﬁeld strength at position r, and ∆0 is the detuning of the oscillating optical
ﬁeld from resonance. In a magic-wavelength optical lattice, the same exact potential is experienced by the ground
and the excited state of the clock transition.

Optical-lattice atomic clocks are advantageous due to the suppression of Doppler shifts by freezing of translational
motion (the clock operates in the Lamb-Dicke regime, where atoms are restricted to a length-scale smaller than
the transition wavelength [8]), the narrow linewidth due to the long lifetime of the states involved in the clock
transition, and the large number M of occupied sites, minimizing the Allan standard deviation [1]. As already
mentioned, the optical-lattice potential light shift is overcome by using trapping lasers at the magic wavelength [2, 3].
Operating optical-lattice clocks in the optical frequency regime, rather than in the microwave, has the added beneﬁt
of increasing the clock frequency ν and thereby reducing δν/ν by ﬁve orders of magnitude. A coherent link between
optical frequencies and the microwave cesium standard is provided by the frequency comb method [9]. Thanks to these
characteristics, atomic optical-lattice clocks have promise of being the frequency standards of the future. Attempts
to further improve the accuracy of such clocks using electromagnetically induced transparency to obtain accuracies
on the order of 1017 or better have also been suggested [4].

A 3-dimensional (3D) optical lattice conﬁguration would allow the largest number of atoms that can participate in
an optical-lattice atom clock. However, when sites begin to be multiply-occupied, atom-atom interactions can shift
the clock transition frequency [5]. This is particularly problematic in a very deep optical lattice since the eﬀective
density in sites with more than one atom will then be very high due to the highly restricted volume. Hence, the
collisional shift, proportional to the particle density, can be very large. It is therefore important to ensure that atoms
individually occupy lattice sites (preferably in the ground motional state of the optical lattice). One way of achieving
this goal is by low ﬁlling of the optical-lattice, so that the probability of having more than one atom per site is small.
If hopping of an atom into a ﬁlled lattice site during the operation of the clock is small, collisional eﬀects will be
minimal.

i

One kind of optical lattice clock conﬁguration that can have minimum collisional eﬀects uses ultracold spin-polarized
fermions in a deep optical lattice. For example, a system of ultracold optically pumped 87Sr atoms in the 5s2 1S0
internal state, ﬁlled to unit ﬁlling. The nuclear spin of the atoms is protected and one expects
F = 9/2, MF = 9/2
|
that the gas will remain spin polarized for a very long time. The probability of ﬁnding two fermionic atoms in a deep
lattice site is extremely low in such a system as long as the gas is suﬃciently cold, since higher occupied bands will
not be populated, and only one fermionic atom will be present in a given site due to the Pauli exclusion principle.
Moreover, fermionic atoms cannot interact via s-wave collisions and p-wave and higher partial waves are frozen out
at low collision energies. Provided the ground motional state of the spin polarized fermion system can be attained by
adiabatically turning-on the optical lattice [10], this system seems to be extremely well-suited for making an accurate

2

clock.

i

Another potentially interesting conﬁguration involves ultracold bosonic atoms such as 88Sr atoms in the 5s2 1S0
internal state in an optical lattice with very low ﬁlling. Since the atoms are bosons, there is no
F = 0, MF = 0
|
single-atom-occupancy constraint, allowing for collisional shifts. These shifts can be minimized if the ﬁlling factor p is
small. Moreover, multiple occupancy caused by tunneling between adjacent populated sites is reduced if the optical
lattice is deep and the probability of hopping of an atom into an adjacent ﬁlled site, Jhop, is small. Therefore, we
expect that the collisional shift should be very low. Here, we investigate the Ramsey fringe clock dynamics for such a
state of 88Sr can be a Raman
system. The transition between the 1S0 |
transition [4], but we can think of the transition between 1S0 and 3P0 as a Rabi transition as long as the detuning
from the intermediate state coupling these two levels is large. Yet another possibility is to use a weak static magnetic
ﬁeld to enable direct optical excitation of forbidden electric-dipole transitions that are otherwise prohibitively weak
by mixing the 3P1 with the 3P0 state [6]. In contrast to multiphoton methods proposed for the even isotopes [4],
this method of direct excitation requires only a single probe laser and no multiphoton frequency-mixing schemes, so
it can be readily implemented in existing lattice clock experiments [7]. I.e., this method for using the “metrologically
superior” even isotope can be easily implemented. However, one of the problems that can arise is that more than one
bosonic atom can ﬁll a lattice site, and these atoms can interact strongly. We shall assume that sites are initially
populated with at most one atom per site, but that during the operation of the Ramsey separated ﬁeld cycle, i.e., the
delay time between the two π/2 Ramsey pulses, T , atoms from adjacent sites can hop; if a site ends up with more
than one atom during the cycle, the clock frequency will be adversely aﬀected by the collisional shift.

It is easy to obtain an order of magnitude estimate for the collisional shift δν in this kind of clock. The product of
the hopping rate Jhop and the Ramsey delay time T gives the probability for hopping between sites. As will be shown

Three distinct collisional eﬀects are found for a single, multiply-populated lattice site. These include a simple linear
frequency shift, a nonlinear shift resulting in asymmetric fringe patterns, and an entanglement-induced reduction in
fringe contrast. In order to show how these eﬀects can take place dynamically during the application of the Ramsey
pulse sequence, we consider a 1D optical lattice and focus on two adjacent sites ﬁlled with one atom in each site,
and calculate the probability of double occupancy due to hopping (tunneling) of an atom to its adjacent site and
the resulting collisional shifts. We show that by varying the direction of the Rabi drive laser with respect to the
principal optical lattice axis, one can induce a phase-diﬀerence between the Rabi drive ﬁelds in adjacent lattice site.
We ﬁnd that due to interference of tunneling pathways, hopping is suppressed when this phase diﬀerence is set to π, as
compared to the case where all sites are driven in phase. Consequently, detrimental collisional eﬀects are diminished
for inverted-phase driving of adjacent sites.
The outline of the paper is a follows.

In Sec. II we review the Ramsey separated oscillatory ﬁelds method for
noninteracting particles and set up the notation we use in what follows. In Sec. III we construct a second-quantized
model, describing the single-site Ramsey scheme for interacting bosons. This model is numerically solved in Sec. IV,
demonstrating various collisional eﬀects on Ramsey fringe patterns. Hopping between sites is introduced in Sec. V
where we present two-site results and propose an inverted Rabi phase scheme to cancel collisional shifts. Conclusions
are presented in Sec. VI.

II. RAMSEY SEPARATED OSCILLATORY FIELDS

Norman Ramsey introduced the method of separated oscillatory ﬁelds in 1950 [11]. A long time-period between the
application of two nearly resonant coherent ﬁelds makes the Ramsey resonance very narrow, and thus suitable for high-
performance clocks and precision measurements [12, 13]. The method has since become a widely used technique for
determining resonance frequencies to high precision. For example, in the Cs fountain clock experiments summarized
in Refs. [13, 14], the observed linewidth of the Ramsey resonance was 1 Hz, two orders of magnitude below that of
thermal Cs clocks [14, 15, 16].

Figure 2 shows the population inversion w versus time and detuning ∆ using a Ramsey separated ﬁeld method
for one atom in an optical lattice site. The ﬁnal time corresponds to the time at which the Ramsey clock signal
is measured as a function of detuning ∆, i.e., either the population of the ground or the excited state is measured
as a function of ∆. Note that the excited state population at the ﬁnal time is unity at zero detuning and that the
population inversion oscillates as a function of detuning.

III. SECOND-QUANTIZED RAMSEY MODEL

In order to study the eﬀects of collisions on Ramsey fringes obtained in a separated-ﬁelds scheme, we use a second-
quantized formalism to treat a multiply-populated single site of the optical potential and calculate the Ramsey fringe
dynamics. The many-body Hamiltonian for a system of two-level atoms, all in the same external motional state of a
trap, can be written as [20, 21]

ˆH =

Here the subscripts g and e indicate the ground and excited states of the two level atom, and ˆai is the annihilation
operator for an atom in internal state i, where i = g, e. The self- and cross- atom-atom interaction strengths are
denoted as Gii and Gij respectively, the internal energy of state i is denoted as Ei, where Eg = ǫg + ~ω and Ee = ǫe.
For bosonic atoms, the creation and annihilation operators satisfy the commutation relations

[ˆai, ˆa†j] = δij ,

[ˆa†i , ˆa†j] = 0 ,

[ˆai, ˆaj] = 0 .

In order to study eﬀects resulting in from the coupling to an environment consisting of a bath of external degrees

of freedom, we use the master equation [18, 19]

where the second term on the right hand side of (19) has the Markovian Lindblad form [17] and gives rise to dissipation
eﬀects of the bath on the density operator. Such terms may be used to depict decay due to spontaneous emission, atom-
surface interactions, motional eﬀects, black-body radiation and other environmental eﬀects. The Lindblad operators
ˆOk are determined from the nature of the system-bath coupling and the coeﬃcients Γk are the corresponding coupling
parameters. In what follows we shall assume that the most signiﬁcant dissipation process is dephasing, and we neglect
all other dissipation eﬀects (e.g., we assume spontaneous emission is negligible because the lifetime of the excited
state is much longer than the Ramsey process run-time, etc.). Thus, the Lindblad operator is taken to be ˆLz, yielding
dephasing of the transition dipole moment without aﬀecting the population of the ground or excited states. We shall
only study this type of t2 dephasing, without fully exploring the eﬀects of other types of Lindblad operators. Clearly,
it is easy to generalize this and consider the eﬀects of additional Lindblad operators, but we do not do so here.
Moreover, non-Markov treatments can be used to generalize the Markovian approximation made in deriving Eq. (19)
[18, 19].

IV. SINGLE-SITE MANY-BODY DYNAMICS

We ﬁrst study how interparticle interactions can modify the Bloch-vector dynamics in a single-site Ramsey scheme.
From Eq. (11) and Eqs. (14)-(16) it is evident that there are three possible collisional eﬀects. First, diﬀerences between
the interaction strengths of ground and excited atoms, will induce a linear frequency shift of the center of the Ramsey
fringe pattern by an amount
1). This eﬀect is illustrated in Fig. 1, where the trajectory of the Bloch vector
during a Ramsey sequence is traced in the absence of interactions (red) and in their presence (blue). Clearly, the
frequency of oscillation in the uv plane during the delay time T is modiﬁed by the interaction. In Fig. 3 we plot the

of dephasing due to coupling to an external bath. In particular, the ﬁnal population inversion is strongly aﬀected.
Comparing Figs. 4(b) and Fig. 4(c), it is clear that collisional dephasing is stronger as the number of particles grows.
The combined eﬀect of decoherence and interparticle entanglement is shown in frames (e) and (f).

are the strength of the hopping to neighboring sites in Hhop and the eﬀective on-site interaction in Hint, respectively.
Hdiﬀ and Hsum are the energy diﬀerence and average of the dressed states of the atoms, and HR induces Rabi
transitions between the two atomic internal states with Rabi frequency Ω(t) and phase φα(t), which are related to
the intensity and phase of the laser which induces these transitions. The Hamiltonian in (20) is identical to what we
used in previous sections, except for the addition of the hopping term ˆHhop that can result in hopping of particles to
adjacent sites with rate Jhop.

Note that the phase φα(t) can depend upon the site index α. Consider, for simplicity, a 1D optical lattice along
the x axis, and a plane wave ﬁeld with detuning ∆ from resonance with wave vector k. The Rabi frequency at site
α is given by Ω(rα, t) = Ω(t) exp[ik
rα] = Ω(t) exp(ikxxα). Thus, there is a phase diﬀerence θ between the Rabi
frequency at neighboring sites, θ = kxδx, where δx is the lattice spacing. The angle between the wave vector k and
the x axis can be adjusted to control the phase diﬀerence θ = φα
1. In what follows, we show that a proper
choice of the relative phase angle θ between Rabi drive ﬁelds in adjacent sites may be used to suppress the tunneling
between them and thus reduce collisional shifts. When Jhop = 0, there is no relevance to the phases φα(t) (they do
not aﬀect the dyanmics), but as soon as hopping from one site to an adjacent site is allowed, these phases can aﬀect
the dynamics.

We expect that for suﬃciently low densities, the probability of ﬁnding more than two adjacent populated sites is
very small. It is therefore possible to capture much of the physics of the hopping process, using a two-site model.
At higher densities, more elaborate models should be used. In Fig. 8 we plot numerical results for two particles in
two sites (N = 2, α = 1, 2) for Jhop = 100 Hz, showing the probability of double occupancy during a Ramsey fringe
sequence in the presence of tunneling, as a function of the relative angle θ. The parameters used are the same as
those used previously, except that now we allow for hopping, and therefore Jhop and the angle θ aﬀects the dynamics.
The initial conditions correspond to a single atom in its ground state in each lattice site before the Ramsey process
begins. When both atoms are driven in-phase (θ = 0), tunneling takes place, leading to multiple occupancy. The
tunneling is signiﬁcantly suppressed for a θ = π phase diﬀerence between the Rabi drives in adjacent sites. As shown in
Fig. 9, this suppression originates from destructive interference. In Fig. 9a we plot the level scheme for a two-particle,
denote Fock states with ng
α particles in the ground- and excited
two-site system. The levels
states respectively, of site α. Depending on the relative phase between the optical drive ﬁelds, tunneling from states
with a ground state atom in one site and an excited atom in another, can interfere constructively or destructively.
Therefore, as seen in Fig. 9b and Fig. 9c, tunneling can only take place between even-parity states. For in-phase
Rabi drive θ = 0 (Fig. 9b), the initial even-parity state
is coupled by a single optical excitation to the
even-parity state (1/√2) (
), for which the two tunneling pathways interfere constructively. In

FIG. 10: (color online) Probability of double-occupation at the end of a Ramsey sequence versus detuning, for diﬀerent values
of the nonlinearity U = G = κ: (a) κ = 0, (b) κ = 5.0 × 102, and (c) κ = 1.0 × 103. Red curves correspond to θ = 0 whereas
blue curves show the lineshape for θ = π.

The lower probability of ﬁnding multiply occupied sites in an inverted-phase Rabi-drive conﬁguration, is manifested
in the emerging Ramsey fringe patterns. In Fig. 10 we plot the probability of double-occupancy at the end of a Ramsey
sequence, as a function of detuning, for diﬀerent degrees of nonlinearity which is arbitrarily set to
= κ. While
increasing nonlinearity generally tends to localize population and reduce tunneling, the probability of ﬁnding both
particles in the same lattice site is always lower for out-of-phase driving. The resulting Ramsey lineshapes are plotted
in Fig. 11, clearly demonstrating reduced collisional eﬀects for θ = π (blue curves), compared to the in-phase driving
ﬁelds scheme (red curves). The center of the distributions for θ = 0 are clearly strongly shifted from ∆ = 0, and
much less shifted for θ = π. This reduced shift in the center of the distribution is, of course, of central importance
for a clock.

VI. CONCLUSION

Optical lattice atom clocks hold great promise for setting frequency standards. In order to achieve high accuracy
with boson atoms, collisional frequency shifts have to be taken in account. We have shown that collisions can degrade
Ramsey lineshapes by shifting their centers, rendering them asymmetric, and by reducing fringe-visibility due to the
loss of single-particle coherence. Considering two adjacent populated sites in a 1D optical lattice conﬁguration, we
propose a method of reducing dynamical multiple population of lattice sites, based on driving diﬀerent sites with

diﬀerent phases of the Rabi drive. Due to destructive interference between tunneling pathways leading to states with
one ground and one excited atom in the same site, hopping is reduced and collisional eﬀects are canceled out. It is
diﬃcult to see how to implement this kind of interference in a 2D or 3D conﬁguration.

While collisional eﬀects are considered here as an unwanted degrading factor, our work also suggests the potential

application of the Ramsey separated ﬁeld method for studying entanglement.

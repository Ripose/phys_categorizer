Abstract
We present a spin-dependent localized Hartree-Fock (SLHF) density-functional approach for the treatment of the inner-shell
excited-state calculation of atomic systems.
In this approach, the electron spin-orbitals in an electronic conﬁguration are
obtained ﬁrst by solving Kohn-Sham (KS) equation with SLHF exchange potential. Then a single-Slater-determinant energy
of the electronic conﬁguration is calculated by using these electron spin-orbitals. Finally, a multiplet energy of an inner-shell
excited state is evaluated from the single-Slater-determinant energies of the electronic conﬁgurations involved in terms of
Slater’s diagonal sum rule. This procedure has been used to calculate the total and excitation energies of inner-shell excited
states of close-shell atomic systems: Be, B+, Ne, and Mg. The correlation eﬀect is taken into account by incorporating the
correlation potentials and energy functionals of Perdew and Wang’s (PW) or Lee, Yang, and Parr’s (LYP) into calculation.
The calculated results with the PW and LYP energy functionals are in overall good agreement with each other and also
with available experimental and other ab initio theoretical data. In addition, we present some new results for highly excited
inner-shell states.

INTRODUCTION

Density functional theory (DFT) [1, 2] has been widely
applied to many areas in theoretical physics and chem-
istry as a powerful ab initio approach for the calculation
of ground-state properties of many-electron systems due
to its computational simplicity and eﬃciency [3, 4]. The
basic equation of DFT is Kohn-Sham (KS) equation [2]
and the key part in KS equation is exchange-correlation
(XC) potential [5].

DFT with a traditional XC potential obtained from
uniform electron gas, such as local density approxima-
tion (LDA) [3, 4] and generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) [6, 7, 8, 9], is a ground-state approach. Because
of incomplete cancellation of spurious self-interactions in
the conventional DFT using LDA or GGA [3, 7, 8, 9]
and the inherent degeneracy (due to the use of spin
and angular-momentum independent local potentials),
the diﬀerences of the KS energy eigenvalues of unoc-
cupied and occupied orbitals are not rigorously deﬁned
as excitation energies. However, the KS energy eigen-
values can serve as good zeroth-order excited-state en-
ergies provided they are obtained by solving KS equa-
tion with a high-quality XC potential [10]. A number
of theoretical methods have been developed by adopt-
ing this point of view [11].
In particular, density
work-functional approach (WF) [12, 13, 14, 15], open-
shell localized Hartree-Fock (LHF) density-functional ap-
proach [16, 17, 18, 19], and multireference LHF density-
functional approach [20, 21], etc., have been successfully
used to calculate excited-state properties of atomic and
molecular systems.

Recently,

an exchange

(X)-only LHF density-
functional theory has been proposed and successfully ap-
plied to ground-state calculations of atomic and molecu-
lar systems [10]. In this X-only DFT, the exchange po-

tential in the KS equation is a LHF exchange potential
derived under the assumption that X-only KS determi-
nant is equal to the Hartree-Fock (HF) determinant. We
have recently extended this approach to excited states
of atomic and molecular systems by assuming that the
X-only KS determinant is also equal to the HF determi-
nant for excited states [22]. Based on this postulate we
have developed a spin-dependent localized Hartree-Fock
(SLHF) density-functional approach for excited-state cal-
culation of atomic and molecular systems [22].
In this
approach, the exchange potential in the KS equation is
an exact nonvariational SLHF exchange potential con-
structed for both the ground and excited states. The
SLHF potential is an analogue of the LHF potential. It
is self-interaction free and exhibits the correct long-range
behavior. Further, the SLHF potential requires the use
of only the occupied orbitals and is dependent of the or-
bital symmetry of the state. This approach associating
with Slater’s diagonal sum rule [23] has been successfully
used to calculate singly, doubly, and triply excited states
of valence electrons of He- and Li-like ions [22] with ac-
curate results.

In this paper, we extend the SLHF density-functional
approach to inner-shell excited states of atomic systems.
We compute the total and excitation energies of inner-
shell excited states of close-shell atomic systems: Be, B+,
Ne and Mg. In the calculation, the correlation potentials
and energy functionals proposed by Perdew and Wang
(PW) [9] and by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) [8] are used
to take into account the electron correlation eﬀect. We
will show that the calculated results are in overall good
agreement with available theoretical and experimental
data, demonstrating that the SLHF density-functional
approach can provide a simple and computationally eﬃ-
cient approach for the accurate calculation of inner-shell
excited states of close-shell atomic systems within DFT.

Finally, we also present some new results for the highly
excited inner-shell states for the ﬁrst time.

II. THEORETICAL METHOD

The SLHF density-functional approach has been dis-
cussed in Ref. [22] in detail and is outlined in this section
for convenience.

In spin-dependent density-functional approach, a spin-
orbital ϕiσ (r) of the ith electron with spin σ (σ = α and
β for spin-up and spin-down, respectively) and its orbital
energy εiσ are determined by the KS equation

and

is the KS Hamiltonian and

σ (r) = Vext (r) + VH (r) + Vxcσ (r) ,
V eﬀ

(3)

is the local eﬀective potential. In Eq. (3), Vext (r) is the
external potential, VH (r) is Hartree potential (classical
Coulomb electrostatic potential between electrons), and
Vxcσ (r) is the XC potential.

For a given atomic system, the external potential
Vext (r) is known exactly. The Hartree potential VH (r)
is given by

VH (r) =

ρ (r′)
|r − r′|

where, ρ (r) = ρα (r) + ρβ (r) is the total electron den-
sity and ρσ (r) (for σ = α and β) is the spin-dependent
electron density deﬁned by

ρσ (r) =

wiσ |ϕiσ (r)|2 .

(5)

Nσ

Xi=1

Here Nσ is the number of electrons with spin σ and wiσ
is the occupied number of electrons in the spin-orbital
ϕiσ (r).

The XC potential can be decomposed into the ex-
change potential Vxσ (r) and the correlation potential
Vcσ (r). In the SLHF density-functional approach, the ex-

In atomic systems, an electron spin-orbital is charac-
terized by three quantum numbers n, l, and σ, where
n and l are the principal quantum number and orbital
angular momentum quantum number of the electron, re-
spectively. In the spherical coordinates, the spin-orbital
ϕiσ (r) of an electron with quantum numbers n, l, and σ
can be expressed by

ϕiσ (r) =

where, Rnlσ(r) is the radial spin-orbital, Ylm(θ, φ) is the
spherical harmonic, m is the azimuthal quantum number,
and i is a set of quantum numbers apart from spin σ of the
spin-orbital. The radial spin-orbital Rnlσ(r) is governed
by radial KS equation,

Here the symbol νσ stands for a set of quantum num-

is accurate for spherically symmetric (close-shell) states,
but it is only an approximation for non-spherically sym-
metric (open-shell) states. It may induce an error when
it is used to evaluate the energy of a non-spherically sym-
metric state. However, the error is negligible compared
to the order of calculated multiplet splitting [11].

To calculate electron spin-orbital, the Legendre gen-
eralized pseudospectral (LGPS) method [24] is used to
discretize the radial KS equation (12). This method asso-
ciated with an appropriate mapping technique can over-
come diﬃculties due to singularity at r = 0 and long-tail
at large r of Coulomb interaction and thus provides a
very eﬀective and eﬃcient numerical algorithm for high-
precision solution of KS equation. Using the electron
spin-orbitals of an electronic conﬁguration, a single Slater
determinant for a speciﬁc electronic state is constructed
and its total energy calculated. The total energy is a
sum of non-interacting kinetic-energy Ek, external-ﬁeld
energy Eext, Hartree energy EH , exchange energy Ex,
and correlation energy Ec. The values of Ek, Eext, EH ,

For a multiplet state that can be described completely
by a single Slater determinant, the energy is calculated
directly from the single Slater determinant. For a multi-
plet state that cannot be represented by a single determi-
nant, the energy can be calculated by means of Slater’s
diagonal sum rule [23]. According to this rule, a sum over
single-Slater-determinant energy E(Di) of determinant
Di from an electron conﬁguration equals to a weighted
sum over multiplet energy E(Mj ) of multiplet state Mj
involved in the same electron conﬁguration, namely,

E(Di) =

dj E(Mj),

(24)

where, the weight dj is the times that the multiplet state
Mj appears in all the single Slater determinants. Similar
procedures have been employed in recent excited-state
calculations [14, 15, 25].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The procedure described in the preceding section is ex-
tended to calculate the total energies (E) and excitation
energies (∆E) of inner-shell excited states of closed-shell
atomic systems: Be, B+, Ne, and Mg.
In the calcu-
lations, the correlation eﬀect, which is characterized by
the correlation potential vcσ (r) and correlation energy
Ec, is taken into account through the correlation poten-
tials and energy functionals of Perdew and Wang (PW)
[9] and of Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) [8], respectively.
The results obtained with these two correlation energy
functionals are listed in columns PW and LYP in the
following tables, respectively. For simplicity, hencefor-
−1 (n′l′) to represent an
ward we use an abbreviation (nl)
electronic conﬁguration for an electron in inner-shell (nl)
being excited to sub-shell (n′l′), unless otherwise speci-
ﬁed. For instance, an abbreviation 1s−12p represents an
electronic conﬁguration of inner-shell excitation 1s2s22p
of Be.

A. Be

In TABLE I we present the total energies and exci-
tation energies from our calculations for inner-shell ex-
cited states 1s−1np 1,3P (n = 2 ∼ 8) of Be. For com-
parison we also list in this table the theoretical results
of density work-functional approach (WF) [26], saddle-
point complex-rotation approximation (SPCR) [27, 28],
and R-matrix method in the close-coupling approxi-
mation (RMCC) [29] and experimental results (Exp.)
[30, 31, 32, 33]. For the total energies, the maximum rel-
ative discrepancies of our PW and LYP results are 0.10%
and 0.25% to the WF results, and 0.27% and 0.39% to the
SPCR results. For excitation energies, the maximum rel-
ative deviations of our PW and LYP results to the exper-
imental results are 0.37% and 0.90%, respectively, while
the maximum relative discrepancies of the WF, SPCR,
and RMCC results to the experimental results are 0.41%,
0.05%, and 0.14%, respectively. This demonstrates that
both the total energies and excitation energies from our
calculations agree well with the experimental and other
theoretical results. On the other hands, due to overesti-
mation of LYP energy functional to correlation energies
of atomic systems with smaller Z [8, 22], the LYP re-
sults are a little bit worse than the PW results. It is also
shown that our PW results for excitation energy are a
little bit better than the WF results.

B. B+

To explore the feasibility of the approach to inner-shell
excitation of atomic ions, we also apply the procedure to
inner-shell excited-state calculation of B+. The total en-
ergies and excitation energies of inner-shell excited states
1s−1np 1,3P (n = 2 ∼ 8) are given in TABLE II along
with theoretical results of Dirac-Fock method (DF) [34]
and available experimental results [34]. For excitation
energies, the relative deviations of our PW and LYP re-
sults are less than 0.32% and 0.64% to the DF results,
and less than 0.29% and 0.60% to the experimental re-
sults. This demonstrates again that our results are in
good agreement with both the experimental and other
theoretical results, and the PW results are a little bit
more accurate than the LYP results for this atomic ion
having smaller Z.

results of density work-functional approach (WF) [26],
conﬁguration-interaction model (CI) [35], and Hartree-
Fock method (HF) [36], and experimental results (Exp.)
[37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44].

For the total energies of excited states 1s−1ns 1,3S
(n = 3 ∼ 8) given in TABLE III, the relative deviations
of our PW and LYP results to the WF results are not
more than 0.03% and 0.02%, respectively. This demon-
strates that the PW energy functional has almost the
same precision as the LYP energy functional in calcula-
tion of total energies of these inner-shell excited states.
For excitation energies, the relative discrepancies of our
PW and LYP results to the experimental result are less
than 0.13% and 0.02%, respectively. This indicates that
the LYP results for the excitation energy are better than
the PW results. Since the total energies from calcula-
tion with PW energy functional are very close to those
with LYP energy functional, the larger discrepancy of the
PW results for excitation energy mainly comes from the
ground-state energy, which is -128.8952 (a.u.) from the
calculation with PW energy functional. This value is dif-
ferent from that with LYP energy functional -128.9331
(a.u.) [22] and that obtained from Hartree-Fock energy
[45] plus correlation energy [46] -128.937 (a.u.). In ad-
dition, the maximum relative discrepancies of the exci-
tation energies from WF calculation and CI calculation
are 0.08% and 0.03% to the experimental results, respec-
tively. This illustrates that our LYP results are very close
to the CI results and better than the WF results.

For the total energies of

inner-shell excited states
1s−1np 1,3P (n = 3 ∼ 8) given in TABLE IV, the rel-
ative deviations of our PW and LYP results to the WF
results are not more than 0.02% and 0.02%, respectively.
This implies that the PW energy functional has the same
precision as the LYP energy functional in the total energy
calculation of these states. For the excitation energies,
the maximum relative discrepancies of our PW and LYP
results to the experimental results are 0.14% and 0.02%,
while the maximum relative deviations of the WF and CI
results to the experimental results are 0.07% and 0.02%,
respectively. This demonstrates that the LYP results for
excitation energy are a little bit more accurate than the
PW results for these inner-shell excited states. It is also
shown that the LYP results are again very close to the
CI results and a little bit better than the WF results.

also present in TABLE IV the total energy of inner-
shell excited state 1s2s22p6 2S of Ne+ and ionization
energy of an inner-shell 1s electron of Ne. For com-
parison we also show in these tables the theoretical

imental results (Exp.) [48, 49] are also shown in these
tables.

For inner-shell excitation of Mg, the excited states in-
volving in excitation of a 2p electron, 2p−1ns 1,3P , are the
only ones that experimental excitation energies are avail-
able, as shown in TABLE V. For these states, the excita-
tion energies from our calculation are in good agreement
with the experimental results. The relative deviations of
our PW and LYP results to the experimental results are
not more than 0.38% and 0.36%, respectively. Thus the
PW energy functional has the same precision as the LYP
energy functional in the excitation energy calculation of
these inner-shell excited states. Apart from an excited
state 2p−14s 3P our results also agree well with the CI-
IOO results. The maximum relative discrepancies of our
PW and LYP results to the CIIOO results are 0.58% and
0.60%, respectively. The larger discrepancies of our re-
sults to the CIIOO results for the state 2p−14s 3P are
caused by the fact that the excitation energy from the
CIIOO calculation is too small.
It is shown from TA-
BLE V that the CIIOO result is much smaller than the
experimental data while our excitation energies are very
close to the experimental results.

For inner-shell excited states relevant to excitation of a
2s electron, the excitation energies from our calculations
with both PW and LYP energy functionals are larger
than the CIIOO results, as shown in TABLE VI and TA-
BLE VII. For the excited states 2s−1np 3P , except an ex-
cited state 2s−13p 3P , the relative deviations of our PW
and LYP results to the CIIOO results are less than 0.70%
and 0.62%, respectively. For the excited state 2s−13p 3P
our PW and LYP results are much larger than the CI-
IOO result. For the excited states 2s−1ns 3S, apart from
an excited state 2s−14s 3S, the relative discrepancies of
our PW and LYP results to the CIIOO results are not
more than 0.41% and 0.25%, respectively. For the ex-
cited state 2s−14s 3S our PW and LYP results are again
much larger than the CIIOO results.

For excitation energies of excited states 1s−1np 3P and

6

1s−1ns 3S given in TABLE VIII and TABLE IX, our
PW and LYP results are smaller and larger than the
CIIOO results, respectively. For excited states 1s−1np
3P the relative deviations of our PW and LYP results
to the CIIOO results are less than 0.02% and 0.08%,
respectively. For excited states 1s−1ns 3S, apart from
a state 1s−14s 3S, the relative discrepancies of our PW
and LYP results to the CIIOO results are not more than
0.04% and 0.03%, respectively. For the state 1s−14s 3S
our LYP result is larger than the CIIOO result by 0.11%.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the procedure we have developed for
excited-state calculation based on SLHF density func-
tional approach and Slater’s diagonal sum rule has been
extended to the treatment of inner-shell excited states of
atomic systems. In this procedure, electron spin-orbitals
in an electronic conﬁguration are obtained ﬁrst by solving
the KS equation with the exact SLHF exchange potential.
Then a single-Slater-determinant energy of the electronic
conﬁguration is calculated by using these electron spin-
orbitals. Finally, a multiplet energy of an excited state is
evaluated from the single-Slater-determinant energies of
the electronic conﬁgurations involved in terms of Slater’s
diagonal sum rule. In this procedure, the key part is the
SLHF exchange potential. This potential qualiﬁes for
inner-shell excited-state calculation because it provides
a potential with free self-interaction, correct long-range
behavior, and symmetry dependence of atomic state. We
have applied this procedure to the calculations of to-
tal energies and excitation energies of inner-shell excited
states of close-shell atomic systems: Be, B+, Ne, and
In the calculation, the generalized pseudospectral
Mg.

method with nonuniform grids is used for optimal dis-
cretization of the spatial coordinates, allowing accurate
and eﬃcient treatment of the KS equation and the spin-
orbital energies for both the ground and excited states.
The correlation eﬀect is taken care of by incorporating
the PW and LYP correlation potentials and energy func-
tionals into calculation. The results from our calculations
with LYP and PW energy functionals are in overall good
agreement with each other and also with the available

more sophisticated ab initio theoretical results and exper-
imental data. The maximum relative discrepancy of our
calculated excitation energies to the available experimen-
tal results is not more than 0.90%, demonstrating that
the SLHF density-functional approach is capable of pro-
viding a powerful and computationally eﬃcient scheme
for accurate inner-shell excited-state calculation of close-
shell atomic systems within DFT. Extension of the SLHF
density-functional approach to open-shell atomic systems

is in progress.

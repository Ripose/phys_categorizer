The lifetime of the metastable 3P2 state of neon has been determined to 14.70(13) s (decay rate
−1) by measuring the decay in ﬂuorescence of an ensemble of 20Ne atoms trapped in
0.06801(62) s

relative excitation to the 3D3 state (0.5 % excitation probability) operation only small corrections
have to be included in the lifetime extrapolation. Together with a careful analysis of residual loss
mechanisms in the MOT a lifetime determination to high precision is achieved.

In contrast to its importance for various active ﬁelds
of research covering such a wide range as atomic physics,
quantum optics, and nuclear physics, there still has been
no measurement of the natural lifetime of the metastable
3P2 state [1] of neon with suﬃcient precision. A selection
of research activities proﬁting from an improved measure-
ment include the quest for Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) of metastable neon, advanced atomic structure
calculations, the investigation of ultracold collisions, and
even precision tests of the electroweak theory being cur-
rently persued by investigating the nuclear decay of an
optically trapped sample of 19Ne in the 3P2 state [2].

Ongoing research directed towards BEC of metastable
neon atoms in the 3P2 state [3, 4] clearly will beneﬁt
from an accurate knowledge of the state’s lifetime. This
includes the optimization of the production process as
well as the study of collision processes such as Penning-
ionization [5] and elastic s-wave scattering. Exciting new
physics complementing the work on metastable helium [6,
7] can be expected for a 3P2 neon condensate. We would
like to point out the study of higher-order correlations
[8] and the intriguing possibility of a modiﬁcation of the
3P2 decay rate due to the high phase-space density or the
phase coherence in a BEC [9].

Signiﬁcant advance in atomic structure calculations
has already been and will be further triggered [10] by
the work presented here. To date only a preliminary ex-
perimental value of 22 s for the 3P2 lifetime of neon ex-
ists [11] with no detailed investigations having been per-
formed [12]. A precise determination of the lifetime will
put a more stringent test on theory. For most rare-gas
atoms, the 3P2 lifetime depends sensitively on electron
correlations and relativistic corrections. The latter have
only a minor eﬀect for the case of neon, making neon
speciﬁcally interesting for a critcal test of electron corre-
lations. In addition, our measurement will close the chain
of 3P2 lifetime measurements for rare-gas atoms beyond
helium performed in recent years for Ar (38+8
−5 s [13]),
Kr (39+5
−1.8 s [14]), and Xe (42.9+0.9
−0.9 s
and 42.4+1.3
−1.3 s [15]), respectively. This will deliver the

input for a detailed systematic investigation of the Z-
dependence of metastable lifetimes.

An accurate experimental determination of the 3P2
lifetimes of rare-gas atoms other than helium has only
been achievable by the ability to prepare cold atom sam-
ples in a MOT [11, 13, 14, 15]. For a precision lifetime
measurement, the coupling of the 3P2 to the 3D3 state by
the MOT light has to be considered since it will modify
the observed decay rate. To date, two diﬀerent methods
making use of a variable MOT-on/oﬀ duty cycle have
been employed, either by directly measuring the rate of
UV photons produced by the decay during a MOT-oﬀ pe-
riod [14, 15] or by extrapolating the observed decay rate
for varying MOT-on/oﬀ duty ratios to vanishing MOT-
on periods [13].

In our approach, we record the decay of ﬂuorescence
in a MOT (Fig. 1) for diﬀerent steady-state values of the
population π3 of the 3D3 state (0.005 < π3 < 0.47). This
allows the extrapolation of the observed decay rate to
π3 = 0 thus giving the 3P2 lifetime. Extreme care has
been taken to achieve optimized experimental conditions
such as low background gas pressure (p < 5×10−11mbar)
and MOT operation for such low values as π3 = 0.005.
This minimizes the amount of required corrections dra-

matically and the accuracy to which the 3P2 lifetime of
Ne can be determined is improved considerably.

With no observable changes in shape and temperature
of the atom sample, the temporal evolution of the ob-
served ﬂuorescence is proportional to the temporal evo-
lution of the number of trapped atoms N(t). The decay
can be described by the diﬀerential equation

d
dt

N(t) = −αN(t) − β

n2(r, t) d3r + O(n3).

Z

The experimental ﬂuorescence data is ﬁtted to a solution
of this equation. No absolute calibration of the atom
number is required for the determination of the decay
constant α. In Fig. 1, non-exponential two-body decay
due to intra-trap collisions can be seen during the ﬁrst
30 seconds. Two-body losses depend on the integral over
the local number density n(r, t) and are described by the
parameter β, the absolute determination of which would
require an absolute calibration of n(r, t), which is not the
scope of this work. An uncalibrated value of β, however,
is determined in our ﬁtting procedure. For all data runs
no contributions of order n3 or higher could be observed.
At low atom numbers the decay is dominated by one-

body losses with rate

The parameter π3 gives the population in the 3D3-state.
Thus (1 − π3)N atoms decay from the 3P2-state with life-
time τ2. The combined rate for all decay channels from
the 3D3-state other than the transition to the 3P2-state

(see Fig. 2) is given by τ

tribute with a rate of γp [16] with p being the pressure
in the vacuum chamber and γ being a constant depend-
ing on the atomic and molecular species present. The
parameter ML summarizes possible MOT losses. The
main objective of this work is to determine the lifetime τ2
from the observed decay rates α by extrapolating to van-
ishing excitation (π3 = 0), background pressure (p = 0),
and MOT losses (ML = 0). Achieving optimized start-
ing conditions (small π3 and p) and minimizing poten-
tial contributions of ML by a systematic analysis of the
MOT characteristics have been essential.

with the total intensity I of the MOT light ﬁelds, the
2
saturation intensity I0 = πhcΓ/3λ3 = 4.08 mW/cm
(linewidth Γ = 2π × 8.18 MHz, λ = 640.4 nm) and de-
tuning ∆. The phenomenological parameter C accounts
for the deviation of the eﬀective total intensity in a three-
dimensional MOT from a one-dimensional two-level sys-
tem [17]. We adopt the notion of [3] and take C = 0.7
with an uncertainty of 0.3. The intensity I is measured
with an uncertainty of 10 %, the detuning ∆ with an
absolute uncertainty of 1 MHz. Therefore, for all data
presented here the uncertainty in C is the dominant con-
tribution to the uncertainty in π3.

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 3. A col-
limated beam of metastable atoms is decelerated in
a Zeeman-slower with the slowing laser beam passing
through the center of the MOT. The MOT light ﬁeld
consists of six individual beams (diameter 22 mm) with
spatially ﬁltered beam proﬁles. All light ﬁelds are de-
rived from a dye laser which is frequency stabilized to a
neon RF-discharge.

For each run, the MOT is loaded for 400 ms reaching
a number of up to 4× 108 atoms, a maximum collision-
limited density on the order of 1×109 cm−3 and a typical
temperature below 1 mK. Then, the loading process is
terminated by blocking the atomic beam and the slowing
laser beam by mechanical shutters, and by switching oﬀ
the magnetic ﬁeld of the Zeeman slower. In the following
measurement period of two minutes, the ﬂuorescence of
the trapped atoms is recorded by a CCD camera cap-
turing ﬁve image frames per second. Fluorescence de-
cay curves are obtained by integrating the counts of each
frame over the region where atoms are present. Great
care has been taken to eliminate the inﬂuence of residual
stray light. The decay curves span up to four orders of
magnitude in signal. Fig. 1 shows two sets of data taken
for diﬀerent values of π3. For π3 = 0.005 a decay rate
of α = 0.06929(48) s−1 and a respective decay time of
α−1 = 14.43 s is observed.

In the following sections we describe our procedure to

cal implementations the trap depth will remain ﬁnite due
to the ﬁnite size of the laser beams. Thus, for a given
beam geometry, a variation in B′ should allow to investi-
gate the MOT stability and to quantify the MOT losses
ML which include diﬀusive motion out of the trapping
volume [19] leading to an exponentially decreasing loss
rate with increasing trap depth and non-ionizing back-
ground gas collisions [16] already being accounted for by
the p → 0 extrapolation. The inﬂuence of the magnetic
ﬁeld gradient on the measured decay rate α is shown in
Fig. 5 for two values of π3 = 0.016 and 0.41, respectively.
In the most relevant case of small π3 (Fig. 5(a)), for
suﬃciently large B′ > 10 G/cm a variation of B′ does
aﬀect the measured α not more than the uncertainties
obtained from the ﬁt. Thus we conclude that for our
operating regime (shaded region in Fig. 5(a)) the trap
depth U0 and escape velocity ve are suﬃciently large and
that potential MOT loss contributions to the decay rate α
are not signiﬁcant. For large π3 (Fig. 5(b)), a variation of
the MOT stability with B′ is observed. Unfortunately, no
quantitative model of the MOT at high saturation exists,
the application of the loss models discussed above is not
straightforward, and only a minimum and a maximum
estimate of ML can be given: Since our decay data for
large π3 have been taken at B′ = 1.5 G/cm which gives
the best MOT stability, it is not clear whether MOT
losses have a signiﬁcant contribution on the determina-
tion of α at all. On the other hand, a linear extrapola-
tion of α to B′ = 0 should overestimate the corrections
to be made [16, 19] giving ML = 0.005(2) s−1 as an up-
per limit. Losses for large π3 only inﬂuence the π3 → 0
extrapolation which we take into account by incorporat-
ing 0 s−1 < ML < 0.005 s−1 into the uncertainties of this
extrapolation.

After this systematic study of the inﬂuence of back-
ground collisions and MOT losses the determination of
the 3P2 lifetime τ2 can be obtained by extrapolating the
measured decay rates to vanishing population π3. Only
data for a pressure below 5 × 10−11 mbar are considered
and an extrapolation to p = 0 is performed. The depen-
dence of αp=0 on π3 is shown in Fig. 6 exhibiting a sim-

MOT decay as a function of pressure has been carried out
(Fig. 4(a)). The pressure is given as the nominal reading
of the vacuum gauge (Balzers IKR070). The speciﬁc com-
position of the background gas is not known. However,
we could observe a linear dependence of α on pressure
over a range of almost two orders of magnitude, indi-
cating a pressure-independent composition of the back-
ground gas. From a linear ﬁt for data taken for π3 < 0.1,

we can determine the slope γ = 5.2(1)×107 mbar
As a special feature of our setup, we can directly deter-
mine a possible oﬀset by simultaneously measuring the
ﬂuorescence and the rate of ions produced by collisions
using a multichannel plate (MCP) ion detector. Under
typical operating conditions we detect ions of diﬀerent
origin: (a) Ne+-ions originating from intra-trap collisions
n2(r, t) d3r). (b) Ions which originate from col-
(rate ∝
lisions of metastable neon atoms with residual gas con-
stituents (rate ∝ N (t) × p). Thus, the ion count rate
Rion(t) can be modelled by

R

Rion(t) = c1N(t) + c2Z

n2(r, t) d3r,

where c1 is assumed to be proportional to p. The val-
ues of c1 obtained for diﬀerent pressures are shown in
Fig. 4(b). From a linear ﬁt we can determine the oﬀset
of the pressure gauge reading to (4 ± 7)× 10−12 mbar also
allowing for a vanishing oﬀset. By combining the results
for γ and the oﬀset, we can extrapolate the observed de-
cay rates to p = 0. Due to the already low background
pressure for our decay measurements only small correc-
tions arise: At p = 5 × 10−11 mbar the background col-
lision rate of γp = 1/(420 s) is more than a factor of 25
smaller than the observed decay rate α.

We also investigated the possibility of additional atom
losses from the MOT (contribution ML in Eq. (2)) at-
tributed to a ﬁnite trap depth U0 or ﬁnite escape veloc-
ity ve [18]. We assume that a lossless MOT would result
from an inﬁnite trapping volume leading to inﬁnite U0
and ve. In principle, this could be achieved for the ap-
plied magnetic ﬁeld gradient B′ approaching zero if the
MOT beams could be made inﬁnitely large. In all practi-

ple linear behavior. Displayed uncertainties in αp=0 are
given by the combined uncertainties in the ﬁt of α and
uncertainties in the p → 0 extrapolation. To minimize
uncertainties in the π3 → 0 extrapolation, only data sets
for π3 < 0.05 and π3 > 0.4 showing the smallest absolute
uncertainties in π3 have been included. The ﬁnal value of
the 3P2 lifetime and decay rate are τ2 = 14.70(13) s and
−1
τ
2 = 0.06801(62) s, respectively . Table I gives a sum-
mary of contributions and uncertainties for these values.
Since stable MOT conditions are directly accessible for
π3 = 0.005 and p < 5 × 10−11 mbar only unprecedented
small corrections are required. The ﬁnal value for τ2 only
deviates from the uncorrected value of α−1 = 14.43 s by

In addition to this result, extrapolating αp=0 to π3 = 1,
that is to a hypothetical total population transfer to the
3D3-state, is also possible. From this, we gain the ﬁrst
experimentally determined lower limit of τ3 ≥ 59 s for
−1
of decay of the 3D3-state via all
the combined rate τ
3
channels except the direct decay to the 3P2 state. How-
ever, this value depends sensitively on the ML-correction
applied for large π3 and only the stated lower limit is ac-
cessible.

To conclude we would like to compare our result of
τ2 = 14.70(13) s to theoretical values obtained by dif-
ferent atomic structure calculations. Prior to our work,
published theoretical values were given in [20] to 24.4 s,
which can be rescaled to 20.0 s using more accurate input
parameters, and in [21] to 22 s. Signiﬁcant remaining dis-
crepancies initiated a reexamination of atomic structure
calculations for the whole set of 3P2 lifetimes of rare-gas
atoms. A preliminary result based on a multiconﬁgu-
ration Dirac-Fock calculation gives a value of 18.9 s for
neon [10]. A high degree of sensitivity to the included
electron correlations has been found. Theoretical val-
ues are still expected to be larger than the experimental
value, since the inclusion of additional electron correla-
tions should further reduce the calculated lifetime. Re-
ﬁned calculations are forthcoming [10]. Most recent ab-
initio calculations using MCHF methods give a lifetime of
16.9 s [22]. Considering the combined progress in exper-
iment and theory, we anticipate that the determination
of the 3P2 lifetime of neon may continue to serve as an
important test for precision atomic structure calculations
in the future.

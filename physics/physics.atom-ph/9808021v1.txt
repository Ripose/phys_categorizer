Abstract

Theories unifying gravity and other interactions suggest the possibility of spa-
tial and temporal variation of physical “constants” in the Universe. Detection
of high-redshift absorption systems intersecting the sight lines towards distant
quasars provide a powerful tool for measuring these variations. We have previ-
ously demonstrated that high sensitivity to the variation of the ﬁne structure
constant α can be obtained by comparing spectra of heavy and light atoms (or
molecules). Here we describe new calculations for a range of atoms and ions,
most of which are commonly detected in quasar spectra: Fe II, Mg II, Mg I,
C II, C IV, N V, O I, Al III, Si II, Si IV, Ca I, Ca II, Cr II, Mn II, Zn II, Ge II
(see the results in Table 3). The combination of Fe II and Mg II, for which
accurate laboratory frequencies exist, have already been used to constrain α
variations. To use other atoms and ions, accurate laboratory values of frequen-
cies of the strong E1-transitions from the ground states are required. We wish
to draw the attention of atomic experimentalists to this important problem.

We also discuss a mechanism which can lead to a greatly enhanced sensitiv-
ity for placing constraints on variation on fundamental constants. Calculations
have been performed for Hg II, Yb II, Ca I and Sr II where there are optical
transitions with the very small natural widths, and for hyperﬁne transition in
Cs I and Hg II.

I. INTRODUCTION

Possible variations of the fundamental physical constants in the expanding Universe are
currently of particular interest because of the implications from uniﬁed theories, such as
string theory and M-theory, that additional compact dimensions of space may exist. The
“constants” seen in our three-dimensional subspace of the theory will vary at the same rate
as any change occurring in the scale lengths of the extra compact dimensions (see, e.g. [1–3]).
Gas clouds which intersect the sightlines towards distant quasars produce absorption lines.
These absorption systems present ideal laboratories in which to search for any temporal or
spatial variation of fundamental constants by comparing the observed atomic spectra from
the distant objects with laboratory spectra (see, e.g. [4] and references therein).

The energy scale of atomic spectra is given by the atomic unit me4
¯h

2 . In the non-relativistic
limit, all atomic spectra are proportional to this constant and analyses of quasar spectra
cannot detect any change of the fundamental constants. Indeed, any change in the atomic
unit will be absorbed in the determination of the red shift parameter z (1 + z = ω
ω′ , ω′ is the
red-shifted frequency of the atomic transition and ω is the laboratory value). However, any
change of the fundamental constants can be found by measuring the relative size of relativistic
corrections, which are proportional to α2, where α = e2/¯hc is the ﬁne structure constant [5].
It is natural to search for any changes in α using measurements of the spin-orbit splitting
within a speciﬁc ﬁne-structure multiplet, and indeed this method has been applied to quasar
spectra by several groups. However, whilst this method is appealing through its simplicity, it is
possible to improve on its eﬃciency. Also, it may even give incorrect results, since corrections
of higher order than α2 are ignored. An order of magnitude sensitivity gain can be achieved by
comparing transition frequencies of heavy and light atoms (or molecules) [6,7]. In this paper
we extend that previous work, presenting the results of calculations of the dependence of the
transition frequencies on α for many atoms and ions where data exist for quasar spectra (see
Table III).

Other possibilities for measuring changes in α include comparisons of diﬀerent optical tran-
sitions, such as s − p and p − d, in the same atom or molecule, or comparisons of microwave
transitions in molecules which contain rotational and hyperﬁne intervals. We have also calcu-
lated the dependence on α of some atomic microwave and optical frequency standards which
could be used for laboratory searches for α variations. For example, one can compare the
Hg II E2 transition ω = 35514 cm−1 with any narrow line of another atomic or molecular
transition having approximately the same frequency. Small frequency diﬀerences (which do
not require very precise absolute calibration) can be measured very accurately. The mercury
frequency has a very large relativistic shift which also has a negative sign (usually the shift is
positive). Therefore, this frequency diﬀerence has a very strong α-dependence.

Finally, there is an interesting possibility for studying transitions between “accidentally”
degenerate levels in the same atom or molecule. There are several practically degenerate
levels of diﬀerent electron conﬁgurations in rare-earth and actinide atoms. Of course, there
are many more possibilities in molecules where there are vibrational and rotational structures.
The relativistic corrections to the diﬀerent energy levels are diﬀerent and can exceed the very
small frequency corresponding to the transition between “degenerate” states by many orders
of magnitude, i.e. a tiny variation of α can change the frequency signiﬁcantly. Also, there
is an interesting dependence on the nucleon mass if the rotational, vibrational and hyperﬁne
structures are involved. In this case one can measure time dependence of the nucleon mass
which is a function of the strong interaction constant. The main problem here is to ﬁnd a
narrow-width transition.

Note that we present all results in this paper assuming that the atomic unit of energy me4

is constant.

A. Semi-empirical estimations

Let us start our calculations using simple analytical estimates of the relativistic eﬀects in
transition frequencies. First consider the relativistic corrections to the frequency of an atomic
transition in a hydrogen-like atom. The relativistic correction to the energy level is given by
(see, e.g. [8])

∆n = −

where Z is the nuclear charge, n is the principal quantum number and j is the total electron
angular momentum. This value of the relativistic correction can be obtained as an expectation
value hV i of the relativistic perturbation V , which is only large in the vicinity of the nucleus.
Therefore, the relativistic correction ∆ is proportional to the electron density near the nucleus
|Ψ(r < a
Z is the size of the hydrogen-like ion). For an external
electron in a many-electron atom or ion the electron density near the nucleus is given by the
formula (see, e.g. [9]) obtained in the semi-classical approximation (n ≫ 1)

n3a3 (a is the Bohr radius, a

where Za is the charge “seen” by the external electron outside the atom, i.e. Za = 1 for
neutral atoms, Za = 2 for singly charged ions, etc.; ν is the eﬀective principal quantum

number, deﬁned by En = − me4

ions ν = n, Za = Z. Thus, to ﬁnd the single-particle relativistic correction, we should multiply

∆ in Eq. (1) by the ratio of |Ψ(r < a

The second term in the square brackets is presented to provide a continuous transition from the
hydrogen-like ion Eq. (1) to the multi-electron ion Eq. (3). In multi-electron ions (Z ≫ Za)
this term is, in fact, a rough estimate based on the direct calculation of hV i. We should
neglect this small term since there are more important many-body corrections.

We see that the relativistic correction is largest for the s1/2 and p1/2 states, where j = 1/2.

The ﬁne structure splitting is given by

∆ls = E(p3/2) − E(p1/2) ≃ −∆(p1/2)/2 ≃ −∆(p3/2).

(4)

In quasar absorption spectra, transitions from the ground state have been observed. There-
fore, it is important to understand how the frequencies of these transitions are aﬀected by
relativistic eﬀects. The ﬁne splitting in excited states is smaller then the relativistic correction
in the ground state, since the density of the excited electron near the nucleus is smaller. As a
result, the ﬁne splitting of the E1-transition from the ground state (e.g., s −p) is substantially
smaller than the absolute shift of the frequency of the s − p transition. The mean energy of
the p-electron is deﬁned as

E(p) =

E(p3/2) +

E(p1/2) ≃ En(p) −

where En is the non-relativistic energy. Therefore, the relativistic shift of the mean s − p
transition frequency is given by

∆(p − s) ≃ −

∆ls − ∆(s1/2).

The formulae (3) - (6) do not take into account many-body eﬀects. For example, relativistic
corrections change the self-consistent atomic potential. The many-body calculations discussed
below show that the relativistic energy shift in atoms with one external electron can be
approximately described by the following equation

∆n =

− C(Z, j, l)

,

#

where C(Z, j, l) is diﬀerent for diﬀerent atoms and partial waves but does not depend on the
principal quantum number. In many cases C(Z, j, l) ≃ 0.6, although noticeable deviations
from this value are possible.

It is easy to explain the sign of the many-body eﬀect. The relativistic single-particle
correction increases the attraction of an electron to the nucleus and makes the radius of the
electron cloud smaller. As a result, the direct Hartree-Fock potential, which is the nuclear
potential screened by core electrons, becomes smaller at short distances. This decreases the
binding energy of a valence electron. Therefore, many-body eﬀects have an opposite sign to
the direct eﬀect.

It is also easy to see why C(Z, j, l) does not depend on the energy of the valence electron.
The eﬀect of a potential change on short distances on the binding energy of an external
electron is proportional to the density of this electron in the vicinity of the nucleus which in
turn is proportional to 1/ν3 (see eq. (2)). On the other hand, the direct relativistic eﬀect
is also proportional to 1/ν3 for the same reason (see eqs. (2,3)). Therefore the ratio of two
eﬀects which is C(Z, j, l)/(2j + 1) is practically independent of the energy of the external
electron.

The accurate value of the relativistic shift can only be obtained from many-body calcu-
lations. However, one can assume that C(Z, j, l) = 0.6 and use (7) for rough estimates of
relativistic corrections. This usually gives better results than a single-particle estimate in eq.
(3). For example, many-body calculations show that, as a rule, the relativistic correction to
the energy is negative for s1/2 and p1/2 states and positive for other states. This behavior is
reproduced by (7) but not by (3). Apart from that, formula (3) suggests that the correction is
largest for s1/2 and p1/2 states and rapidly decreases with j while many-body calculations show
that the correction for d-states is sometimes bigger than for p-states. This is again reproduced
by (7) where there is a strong cancelation between two terms in the case of p-states. Note that
this complex behavior of the relativistic eﬀects cannot be explained in terms of single-electron
density at the origin and should be attributed to many-body eﬀects.

Let us see now how eqs. (4)-(6) will be modiﬁed if the many-body correction C(Z, j, l) is
included. Assuming the same value of C(Z, j, l) for p1/2 and p3/2 states we have for the ﬁne
splitting

For the mean energy of the p-electron instead of (5) we have

With C = 0.6 the second term in (9) is numerically small. Hence, relativistic corrections move
the p1/2 and p3/2 states in opposite directions, leaving the mean energy almost unchanged.
Therefore, the relativistic shift of the mean s − p transition is mostly given by the energy shift
of the s-state

(10)

The relative sizes of relativistic corrections are proportional to Z 2, so they are small in light
atoms. Therefore, we can constrain changes in α by comparing transition frequencies in
heavy and light atoms. We stress that the most accurate and eﬀective procedure includes
all relativistic corrections and the analysis of all available lines (rather then the ﬁne splitting
within one multiplet only). We have not discussed here contribution of the Breit relativistic

much smaller then the contribution from spin-orbit interaction. Our numerical calculations
have demonstrated that the contribution of the Breit interaction to the frequency of s-p
transition ∆(p − s) is indeed negligible.

B. Relativistic many-body calculations

Accurate calculations of relativistic eﬀects in atoms have been done using many-body
theory which includes electron-electron correlations. We used a correlation-potential method
[10] for atoms with one external electron above closed shells and a combined conﬁguration
interaction and many-body perturbation theory method [11] for atoms with several valence
electrons. A relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) Hamiltonian was used in both cases to generate a
complete set of single-electron orbitals. The value of the relativistic corrections were obtained
by repeating the calculations for diﬀerent values of α in the RHF Hamiltonian.

The form of the the single-electron wave function we use explicitly includes a dependence

on the ﬁne structure constant α

ψ(r)njlm =

f (r)nΩ(r/r)jlm
iαg(r)n ˜Ω(r/r)jlm !

This leads to the following form of the RHF equations

(11)

(12)

(13)

The non-relativistic limit can be achieved by reducing the value of α to α = 0.

For atoms or ions with one external electron above closed shells, the calculations begin
with the V N −1 approximation. A Hartree-Fock procedure is carried out initially for a closed
shell ion with the external electron removed. When convergence for the core is achieved, the
states of the external electron are calculated in the ﬁeld of the frozen core. The main reason
for this approach is the simplicity of the perturbation theory for calculation of the correlation
corrections. It is well known that correlations are very important in many-electron atoms and
should be included into the calculations to obtain accurate results. We do this by means of
many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and a correlation potential method [10].

The correlation potential ˆΣ is deﬁned as an operator which gives a correlation correction

to the energy (ionization potential) of the valence electron

δǫa = ha| ˆΣ|ai,

(14)

The expectation value here is taken over the single-particle wave function of the external
(valence) electron. Thus, ˆΣ is another non-local operator which can be included in (13) by
redeﬁning the non-local potential

Vexch(r, r′) → Vexch(r, r′) + Σ(r, r′).

(15)

Single-electron states of a valence electron calculated in a non-local potential (15) are often
called Brueckner orbitals.

MBPT is used to calculate Σ. Perturbation expansion starts from the second order in
residual Coulomb interaction. Dominating higher-order correlations can also be included by
using the technique developed in Refs. [12]. However we found that for the few electron ions
such as C IV and Si IV, second-order results are already of very high accuracy (see Table
I). Therefore, we decided that the accurate calculations of higher order corrections are not
needed.

For some other atoms we introduce ﬁtting parameters fv into the expression for the non-
local potential in (13) to simulate the eﬀect of higher-order correlations: Vnon−local = Vexch +
fvΣ, where v = s, p or d. The values for fs, fp and fd are chosen to ﬁt the experimental
data for laboratory value α = 1/137.036. In all cases the values of fv are close to unity. The
same fv have been used for calculations with varying α. This procedure works well because
the accuracy of the results in the second order is already good and only a small correction is
introduced by the ﬁtting parameters.

For atoms with more then one external electron we use the combination of the conﬁguration

interaction method with many-body perturbation theory [11].

1. As for single-electron-above-closed-shells atoms, we start calculations from the RHF
method in V N −1 approximation. However, this starting approximation does not corre-
spond to a closed-shell system and needs to be further speciﬁed. We do this in a very
simple way. The contribution of an open shell to the Hartree-Fock potential is calcu-
lated using the complete shell potential multiplied by the “occupation” factor n/(2j +1),
where n is the actual number of electrons on that shell and j is the total single-electron
momentum. Single-electron basis states are calculated in this Hartree-Fock potential
with one external electron removed (V N −1 potential).

2. All basis states are divided into core states and valence states. Core states are frozen
and included into calculations only via the eﬀective potential of the core. Valence states
are used as a basis for the conﬁguration interaction method. Note that the deﬁnition of
the core at this stage does not necessarily coincide with the core in RHF calculations.
For example, for Fe II 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 states are core states in the RHF procedure.
But these states are also included into the conﬁguration interaction, so they are valence
states in the CI calculations.

3. The eﬀective Hamiltonian of the CI method is constructed. To include correlations
between core and valence electrons we modify the eﬀective Hamiltonian of the standard
CI method by adding an extra operator Σ

ˆH CI

ef f → H CI

ef f + ˆΣ.

The operator Σ consists of two parts. Σ1 is the one-electron operator which describes
the correlation interaction between a valence electron and the core. Σ1 is very similar to
the correlation potential Σ in (15) which we used for atoms with one external electron
above closed shells. Σ2 is a two-particle operator which describes the eﬀects of screening
of the Coulomb interaction between valence electrons by the core electrons.

It has been demonstrated in Refs. [11] that the core-valence correlations are very im-
portant and usually dominate over correlations between valence electrons. Thus, it is
more important to include Σ than to achieve the completeness of the basis in the CI
calculations.

4. The standard CI technique is used to diagonalize the matrix of the eﬀective CI Hamil-

tonian and obtain many-electron energies and wave functions.

We need to apply this method to the atoms with many electrons in open shell. This can
make conﬁguration space and computation time very large. However, we do not need very
high accuracy in the present calculations. Therefore, we have made a few simpliﬁcations to
the method compared to Ref. [11]. The eﬀect of screening (Σ2) is usually much smaller than
one-electron correlations with the core (Σ1) and we neglect it. We also neglect subtracting
diagrams in Σ1 (see Ref. [11]) because there must be strong cancelations between screening and
subtracting diagrams. Finally, we use a relatively small basis set with 3 to 4 single-electron
basis states of each symmetry. This usually leads to a few hundred conﬁgurations. This small
basis is not complete to high precision. However the results are reasonably good because
correlations with the core are included (see Table II). To simulate the eﬀect of incompleteness
of the basis and of the omitted diagrams we introduce ﬁtting parameters for Σ, similar to
what we did for atoms with one external electron. The results for Cr II presented in Table II
illustrate the eﬀects of core-valence correlations, correlations between valence electrons and
the eﬀect of ﬁtting. Note that only one ﬁtting parameter was used to ﬁt all energy levels.

There are two contributions to the relativistic energy shift. The ﬁrst is the direct rel-
ativistic correction to the energy of a valence electron in the Hartree-Fock-Dirac equations
(12). This correction can be found be varying α in eq. (12) with ﬁxed potential. There is
also an indirect relativistic correction which appears because of the change of the core po-
tential (including correlation potential) due to the relativistic eﬀects in the core. Neither
the correlation potential Σ, nor the standard Hartree-Fock potential depend on α explicitly.
This dependence appears via the basis set of single-electron wave functions used to calculate
both potentials since these wave functions had been obtained by solving Dirac-like equations
(12). Full-scale calculations, repeated for diﬀerent values of α, were necessary to reveal this
implicit relativistic behavior. The value of the indirect eﬀect is not small and in some cases
exceeds several times the value of the direct one. This indirect relativistic eﬀect is essentially
a many-body eﬀect. It is responsible for the failure of the single-particle formula (3) which is
unable to reproduce the value of the relativistic correction accurately.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Here E0, Q1 and Q2 describe the position of the conﬁguration center, K1 and K2 describe
the level splitting within one conﬁguration, L is the total orbital angular momentum, S is
the total electron spin and αl is the laboratory value of α. We introduce an (LS)2 term to
describe deviations from the Lande interval rule. There are two sources of the (LS)2 term: the
second order in the spin-orbit interaction (∼ (Zα)4) and the ﬁrst order in the Breit interaction
(∼ α2 = 5.3 × 10−5).

The second-order spin-orbit interaction is larger for heavy atoms where we actually need to
introduce the (LS)2 term. Therefore, we ﬁrst ﬁtted the experimental ﬁne structure intervals
to ﬁnd K1 and K2 (numerical calculations give close values of K1 and K2). Then we used
3/4αl to ﬁnd the dependence of the conﬁg-
numerical calculations for α =
uration center on α (coeﬃcients Q1 and Q2). It is convenient to represent the ﬁnal results in

αl )2 − 1, y = ( α

One can use these data to ﬁt absorption systems in quasar spectra in order to measure or
place upper limits on any variation of α. The maximum theoretical sensitivity comes from
comparing the spectra of Fe II and Cr II since relativistic eﬀects in both ions are large and
have opposite sign. The eﬀect here is about 20 times larger than the ﬁne splitting for each of
the ions.

An analysis of the theoretical data reveals some interesting tendencies in the behavior of

the relativistic corrections apart from being proportional to Z 2:

• Within a series of one-electron orbitals of a given symmetry, the relativistic energy shift
is largest for the lowest orbital and decreases for orbitals of higher energies. This trend
is supported by the semi-empirical consideration presented in section 1. The higher
electron density in the vicinity of the nucleus gives larger relativistic eﬀects. This also
explains why the relativistic shift of the ground state energy is bigger when ionization
potential is larger.

• When α is changing towards its non-relativistic limit α = 0, one-electron energies of s
and p1/2 states move up while energies of p3/2 and d states move down. The relativistic
shifts of s and d states tend to be large while the energy shifts of p states are relatively
small. Note that the single-particle consideration suggests that the relativistic shifts are
large for s and p1/2 states and all energies move up when α is decreasing (see formulae
(3 - 5). Accurate calculations give diﬀerent behaviors due to indirect relativistic eﬀects:
relativistic corrections to the core orbitals change the electronic potential which in turn
shifts the energy of the external electron. This eﬀect is neglected in a naive single-particle
formulae. The direct eﬀect dominates over the core change eﬀect for s-states. For p-
states these two eﬀects are close in magnitude but opposite in sign. The core change
eﬀect dominates for d-states. Thus, introduction of C(Z, j, l) in eq. (8) eﬀectively takes
into account the core change eﬀect.

These tendencies are illustrated by the results presented in Table III. For example, the
relativistic shifts of frequencies of E1 transitions are negative in Cr II and Ge II and positive
for other atoms. This is because these transitions correspond to a d −p one-electron transition
in the case of Cr II and to a p − s transition for Ge II while for the other atoms the transitions
are of the s − p type. The relativistic correction for Ge II is relatively small because the
corresponding transition may be described as the transition from the ground p orbital to
excited s orbital and because the relativistic corrections are small for both p states and excited
states. Another example is the sharp increase of the relativistic eﬀect from Ca II to Cr II.
This is due to the coherent eﬀect of two factors: bigger Z and bigger ionization potential for
Cr II as compared to Ca II.

As is apparent from the analysis above one should expect the biggest relativistic shift for
the s − d (or d − s) transitions in heavy atoms. These transitions are not observed in quasar
absorption systems but may be suitable for laboratory experiments. The natural line width for
these transitions is very small. Futhermore, very precise measurements of the frequencies of
many such transitions already exist since they are used as atomic optical frequency standards.
We present in Table IV relativistic shifts of frequencies of some atomic transitions which are
used or proposed as optical frequency standards. These include the strongly forbidden E1
transition in Ca I [13] and E2 transitions in Sr II [14], Yb II [15] and Hg II [16]. There are
many other atoms which are being studied as possible frequency standards but which are not
included in the table. These include Mg I [17], In II [18], Xe I [19], Ag I [20], etc. Note that

the biggest relativistic eﬀect is in Hg II. This is because of the d − s transition and a high
value of Z. This makes Hg II the most interesting candidate for a laboratory search for α
variations.

The following limit of α variation was found in Ref. [7]:

h ˙αi
α = +2.6 ± 5.2 × 10−16
Assuming ˙α/α = 10−15 one can get for the 5d106s 2S1/2 − 5d96s2 2D5/2 transition in Hg II

(18)

˙ω = 3Hz yr−1,

which should be compared with the natural linewidth limit of 1.8 Hz [16].

There are also ongoing laboratory searches for variations of α using microwave atomic fre-
quency standards (atomic clocks) (see, e.g. [22]). There are a number of microwave frequency
standards which use ground state hyperﬁne structure (hfs) intervals of atoms or ions (see, e.g.
review [23]). These include hfs of Rb, Cd+, Cs, Ba+, Yb+, Hg+ [23]. Here again the biggest
relativistic eﬀects are in the Hg+ ion.
It is convenient to present the α-dependence of hfs
constants in a form similar to (17)

Ahf s = (

)2(A0 + qx),

α
αl

(19)

where A0 is the hfs constant for α = αl. Its value was recently measured to very high precision:

A0(Hg+) = 40507347996.84159(14)(41)Hz [21].

Many-body calculations similar to the calculations of energies described above show that
q = 40500 MHz for Hg II and q = 956 MHz for Cs I. Note that A0(133Cs) = 2298157943 Hz.
This is the exact value because the frequency 9192631770 Hz of the 6s F = 3 − 6s F = 4 hfs
transition in 133Cs, which is equal to 4A0(6s), is used as a deﬁnition of the metric second.

This is in good agreement with estimates based on the Fermi-Segre formula [22]. The best
sensitivity of various clock rate comparisons can be achieved when Hg+ clocks are compared
with an H maser [22] (parameter q = 0 for H). Assuming again ˙α/α = 10−15 yr−1 we will
get 2.3 × 10−15yr−1 for the frequency rate shift between H maser and Hg+ clocks. Note that
the ratio of hyperﬁne structure constants is also sensitive to the variation of nuclear magnetic
g-factors which may appear due to variation of strong interaction.

One more interesting possibility is to use transitions between “accidentally” degenerate
levels in the same atom. Such meta-stable levels exist, for example, in the Dy atom: two
J = 10 opposite parity levels 4f 105d6s and 4f 95d26s lying 19797.96 cm−1 above ground state.
(This pair of levels was used to study parity non-conservation in Refs. [24,25]). There are
other examples of “accidentally” degenerate levels in the rare-earth and actinide atoms and
many close levels in other heavy atoms and ions (in the absence of degeneracy one should
look for s − d or s − p transitions where the relativistic eﬀects are larger). In the case of
“accidental” degeneracy, the contribution of the relativistic correction to the frequency of
the E1 transition in a heavy atom (∼ 1000cm−1) is compensated by the diﬀerence in the
Coulomb interaction energies of the two conﬁgurations. However, if α varies with time, this
compensation will eventually disappear. Thus, we have a correction ∼ 1000 cm−1(( α
αl )2 −1) to
the very small (< 0.01 cm−1) frequency of the transition. One can measure, for example, the
time dependence of the ratio of frequencies for transitions between the hyperﬁne components

of these two states.
In the case of “accidentally” degenerate levels belonging to diﬀerent
electron terms in a molecule one can have enhanced eﬀects of the change of both α and the
nucleon mass. In the latter case the enhancement factor is the ratio of the vibration energy to
the small frequency of the transition. The problem in these degenerate level cases is to ﬁnd a
transition with a small natural width.

The ﬁrst three electronically excited states in the alkaline-earth-metal atoms magnesium, calcium,
and strontium comprise the (nsnp) 3P o
J (J = 0, 1, 2) ﬁne-structure manifold. All three states are
metastable and are of interest for optical atomic clocks as well as for cold-collision physics. An
eﬃcient technique—based on a physically motivated potential that models the presence of the ionic
core—is employed to solve the Schr¨odinger equation for the two-electron valence shell. In this way,
radiative lifetimes, laser-induced clock shifts, and long-range interaction parameters are calculated
for metastable Mg, Ca, and Sr.

INTRODUCTION

Eﬀectively, alkaline-earth-metal atoms are two-electron atoms, at least at low excitation energies. Alkaline-earth-
metal atoms display—like true two-electron systems—spin singlet and triplet level manifolds, which give rise to
narrow intercombination transitions. However, since all alkaline-earth-metal atoms possess a closed K shell, their
level structure does also show notable diﬀerences to that of heliumlike systems.

In this work we focus on the lowest 3P o manifold, with ﬁne-structure components J = 0, 1, 2, in the alkaline-
earth-metal atoms magnesium, calcium, and strontium. These three ﬁne-structure states represent the ﬁrst three
electronically excited states in these species. The excitation energies, relative to the 1S0 ground state, are reproduced
in Table I [1]. The table illustrates that for all three atoms, the excitation energies correspond to optical wavelengths
accessible by modern laser sources. However, that does not imply the ﬁne-structure components of the 3P o manifold
0 and the 3P o
are easy to excite. The transition from the ground state to the 3P o
2
states is, additionally, in general electric-dipole-forbidden. (See Ref. [2] for a thorough introduction to the topic of
forbidden transitions in one- and two-electron atoms.) This makes the 3P o manifold in the alkaline-earth-metal atoms
interesting for several applications in the physics of cold atoms.

1 is spin-forbidden, that to the 3P o

0 transition [14, 15, 16, 17, 18].

The unique level structure triggered advances in laser-cooling technology and allowed to explore processes in a
magneto-optical trap at a new level [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Current successful approaches to an optical frequency
standard using neutral, laser-cooled atoms are based on the relatively small linewidth of the 1S0 →
1 transition
in calcium [11, 12, 13]. Signiﬁcant improvement in accuracy is expected from the strategy of storing fermionic 87Sr
3P o
atoms in an optical lattice and probing the 1S0 →
Due to the prevalence of stable alkaline-earth-metal isotopes with vanishing nuclear angular momentum, it is possible
to investigate cold collisions and to perform photoassociation spectroscopy free of any complications from hyperﬁne
structure [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. However, it is not possible to form a quantum-degenerate gas [24, 25, 26] of ground-state
alkaline-earth-metal atoms by employing evaporative cooling in a pure magnetic trap. Therefore, it has been suggested
2 state [27, 28]. Several groups have already succeeded in magnetically trapping 3P o
to make use of the long-lived 3P o
2
alkaline-earth-metal atoms [29, 30, 31, 32]. Theoretical studies have uncovered that anisotropic interactions between
3P o

2 atoms in an external magnetic ﬁeld lead to unexpectedly rich collision physics [33, 34, 35].
It is the purpose of this paper to provide a concise overview of the properties of Mg, Ca, and Sr in the 3P o
0 ,
3P o
1 , and 3P o
In Sec. II we describe our speciﬁc approach to the electronic-structure problem of eﬀective
two-electron atoms. The method adopted is not only numerically eﬃcient, it can supply atomic data at a level of
accuracy comparable with high-level ab initio calculations. Section III is devoted to a discussion of spontaneous
decay of the individual ﬁne-structure components of the 3P o manifold. Then, in Sec. IV, we calculate the eﬀect of

2 states.

II. TREATMENT OF THE ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE PROBLEM

Our strategy toward solving the electronic-structure problem of alkaline-earth-metal atoms involves the following
steps [36, 37, 38]. We ﬁrst treat the eﬀective one-electron eigenvalue problem of the singly-charged alkaline-earth-
metal ion with a single valence electron. This valence electron moves in a one-particle model potential that reproduces
the valence excitation energies of the monocation. We represent the radial degree of freedom of the electronic wave-
function in a ﬁnite-element basis set. From the solutions of the one-electron problem, two-electron basis functions are
constructed. The eﬀective two-electron Hamiltonian, which describes the neutral atom and which fully incorporates
valence-electron correlation, is represented in this basis and diagonalized. In this way, eigenenergies and eigenvectors
of the two-electron valence shell are obtained.

When treating the eﬀective one-electron problem of the monocation, we employ the one-electron Hamiltonian

A. One-particle Hamiltonian

h1 =

1
2 ∇

−

2 + V + V (so).

The operator V represents the electrostatic ﬁeld generated by the noble-gaslike core. This is a central ﬁeld. However,
an explicit dependence of the associated potential on the orbital angular momentum quantum number l must be
included to take account of the fact that electrons with l = 0 dive deep into the core and experience relativistic eﬀects
(orbital contraction). Such scalar relativistic eﬀects decrease with the average distance from the nucleus and thus
with l. Therefore, we assume that the spin-angular representation of V can be written as

= δj,j′ δmj,mj′ δl,l′ Vl(r).

The quantum numbers j and mj refer to the total angular momentum of the valence electron, s = 1/2 denotes its
spin. In this work, the following parametrization of Vl(r) is used:

Vl(r) =

(cid:9)

Z is the nuclear charge. The parameters αl,1, αl,2, αl,3, αcp, and rl are listed in Ref. [38]. The potential Vl(r) describes
the interaction of the valence electron with the ionic core at various length scales. For very large distances from the
core, the electron is attracted by a point charge of charge +2. As the electron comes closer, the ionic core responds to
the presence of the electron and becomes polarized, as expressed by the term proportional to αcp/r4. Below r = rl,
the electron dives into the core. The parameters αl,1, αl,2, and αl,3 mediate the transition from the exterior region of
the core to the interior, where at very small length scales the electron interacts with the unscreened charge Z.

Spin-orbit interaction is represented in Eq. (1) by the operator V (so):

To this end, we apply a technique based on ﬁnite elements [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44].

For the radial degree of freedom, we introduce a quadratically spaced grid of N + 1 grid points between r = 0 and
r = rmax, i.e., ri = rmaxi2/N 2, i = 0, ..., N . In each interval [ri, ri+1], six unique, linearly independent ﬁfth-order
Hermite interpolating polynomials can be constructed that satisfy the boundary conditions

These formulas correct some misprints in Eq. (49) of Rescigno et al. [43]. Three continuous basis functions, with
continuous ﬁrst and second derivatives, can now be associated with grid point ri (i = 1, ..., N

1):

−

Bj,i(r) = Pj,i(r) + Qj,i−1(r), j = 0, 1, 2.

Using these, the function value at grid point ri, the ﬁrst derivative, and the second derivative of any wavefunction
can be represented. At the end points, r0 and rN , we set

which is consistent with the boundary condition speciﬁed in Eq. (7), and

B0,0(r) = 0, Bj,0(r) = Pj,0(r), j = 1, 2,

B0,N (r) = 0, Bj,N (r) = Qj,N −1(r), j = 1, 2,

which selects solutions to Eq. (7) that vanish at r = rmax.

The solutions to the eigenvalue problem of ¯h,

(the explicit dependence on angular momentum quantum numbers is suppressed) are found by expanding the eigen-
functions in terms of the ﬁnite-element basis functions Bj,i(r):

Since the basis function Bj,i(r) vanishes outside [ri−1, ri+1], both matrices, ¯h and o, have a simple banded structure
with small bandwidth. The high degree of sparsity is ideal for iterative solvers [45]. Using the Lanczos-based package
ARPACK [46], we calculate—for each valid combination of angular momentum quantum numbers l and j—the ﬁrst
18 eigenfunctions outside the core shells. In other words, solutions associated with inner shells are skipped. Thus,
the selected valence-electron solutions display correct nodal behavior.

We describe the neutral atom employing the eﬀective two-electron Hamiltonian

i.e., within the approach we take, both valence electrons move in the ﬁeld of the model potential V (Eqs. (2) and (3)),
are subject to spin-orbit coupling through V (so) (Eqs. (4) and (5)), and experience mutual Coulomb repulsion.

In order to tackle the eigenvalue problem of h2, we construct two-electron basis functions, in jj coupling, from the

together with standard Wigner–Racah algebra [48, 49, 50], the matrix of the electron–electron interaction term in
Eq. (22) can be calculated.

The resulting matrix representation of h2 is suﬃciently small to allow for full numerical diagonalization. Properties
of the valence shell can now be computed from the spectrum and eigenvectors of this matrix. In order to estimate the
accuracy of our calculations, we ﬁrst calculate the physical quantity of interest (a radiative decay rate, for example),
ensuring convergence with respect to all basis set parameters. In this step, the eigenenergies and the relevant matrix
elements with respect to the eigenvectors are taken from our calculations. Then we recalculate that physical quantity
by replacing the energies of the most important states by experimental energies taken from Ref. [1]. Finally, we quote
the result based on the experimental energies together with an error estimate given by the diﬀerence from the result
calculated using theoretical energies.

III. RADIATIVE DECAY RATES

3P o

The bosonic atoms 24Mg, 40Ca, and 88Sr are by far the most abundant isotopes of magnesium, calcium, and
strontium, respectively. The nuclei in these isotopes have vanishing nuclear spin, implying that the quantum number
J = 0 in the 3P o
0 state is exact. As all one-photon operators have a rank greater than zero, the most important
way the 3P o
0 state can decay is via an E1M1 two-photon process, which, in contrast to E1E1, can mediate the parity
change between 3P o
0 and 1S0. The E1M1 process has been analyzed in detail for the radiative decay of the 3P o
0 state
in heavy heliumlike ions [51, 52], where this process competes with the usual E1 decay. (In heliumlike systems, the

It is not a priori clear that the valence-electron wavefunctions derived from the model potential, Eq. (3), have the
correct behavior near the nucleus, even if valence excitation spectra can be well reproduced. In order to check this, we
employed the hyperﬁne-coupling operator Vhf to quantitatively calculate hyperﬁne parameters for the (5s5p) 3P o
1 and
3P o
1 we ﬁnd A = -278 MHz and B = -30.8 MHz. This result is in reasonable agreement
with an experiment by zu Putlitz [56], who measured A = -260 MHz and B = -35.7 MHz. Heider and Brink [57]
determined the hyperﬁne parameters for the 3P o
2 state: A = -213 MHz and B = 67.2 MHz. Our calculation gives A
= -231 MHz and B = 56.5 MHz. Even though the agreement is not perfect, it indicates that we should be able to
calculate the hyperﬁne-induced coupling of the 3P o

0 state to other electronic levels with an accuracy of about 10%.

Since the hyperﬁne-coupling operator Vhf (Eq. (28)) is a tensor of rank 0 with respect to rotations of nucleus and
electrons, it conserves the total angular momentum of the atom, F . Furthermore, for the transition from 3P o
0 to 1S0,

0 decay rates in the fermionic alkaline-earth-metal isotopes, as calculated on the basis of Eq. (30), are
collected in Table II. We note that the lifetimes are now much shorter—by about 10 orders of magnitude—than
in the bosonic isotopes. Nevertheless, this is still suﬃciently long to make the 1S0 →
0 transition interesting for
optical atomic clocks. Especially the strontium isotope 87Sr—which has a rather narrow 3P o
0 linewidth of about 1
mHz—is a candidate for a future ultraprecise atomic clock [16]. In fact, this is the only one of the three isotopes
25Mg, 43Ca, and 87Sr, for which we are aware of an analogous 3P o

enabled by the presence of spin-orbit coupling—a relativistic eﬀect that becomes more pronounced in heavier atoms.

Our calculated reduced electric-dipole matrix elements for the 3P o
1S0 transition agree to about the 10% level with
recent high-level many-body and conﬁguration-interaction calculations [59, 60]. The result for the calculated decay
rate, ΓE1, is presented in Table III. As expected, the decay rate increases from Mg to Sr due to enhanced spin-orbit
coupling.

far. In Sr, however, due to the ω3 dependence in Eq. (32), M1 decay makes the biggest contribution. Also shown in

IV. DYNAMIC STARK EFFECT

As mentioned in the introduction, Sec. I, the transition from the ground state to the 3P o

0 state in the fermionic
isotope 87Sr is of interest for the development of an ultraprecise optical clock based on neutral atoms trapped in an
optical lattice [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. It has been pointed out by Katori et al. that with this approach a relative accuracy
of better than 10−17 should be achievable [16].

The optical lattice serves three purposes. If each lattice site is occupied by at most one atom, collisional clock
shifts can be suppressed (see Ref. [18] for a discussion of frequency shifts caused by dipole–dipole interactions among
atoms in diﬀerent lattice sites). Furthermore, using trapped atoms, long interaction times with the probe laser can be
realized. This is particularly important when exciting a transition with exceptionally small linewidth (see Table II).
A third beneﬁt is the possibility of conﬁning the atoms in the Lamb–Dicke regime [14, 16, 17, 67]. In this way, atomic
recoil- and Doppler-shifts can be eliminated.

The intense laser ﬁeld needed to conﬁne the atoms perturbs them. To lowest order in perturbation theory, each
atomic level is shifted by a level-speciﬁc amount proportional to the intensity of the laser [68]. This eﬀect is referred
to as dynamic (or ac) Stark shift. The dynamic Stark shift of state

can be calculated from [68]

However, it is possible to ﬁnd a magic wavelength for the trapping laser ﬁeld such that the dynamic Stark shifts
of the two levels involved in the clock transition are identical [14, 16, 17]. In other words, at the magic wavelength,
the clock frequency is virtually unaﬀected by the presence of the optical lattice. In a recent calculation, the magic
wavelength for the 1S0 →
0 transition in Sr was found to be about 800 nm [16], in agreement with the experimental
value of 813.5(9) nm [17].

Using Eq. (37), we determined the magic wavelength for the proposed clock transition within our model-potential
approach. The results are collected in Table V. Within our error bars, our result for Sr is in agreement with the
previous calculation and with the experiment. To our knowledge, Mg and Ca have not been considered before. As
can be seen in Table V, the magic wavelength in Mg is too blue to be ideal for trapping with current laser sources.
The magic wavelength we ﬁnd in Ca appears to be much more attractive. In view of this result and of the small decay
width of the 3P o
0 state in 43Ca (see Table II), fermionic calcium appears to be an excellent candidate for an optical
atomic clock and may serve as an interesting alternative to 87Sr.

V. LONG-RANGE PARAMETERS

A.

1S0

While collisions among atoms are to be minimized in atomic clocks, interatomic interactions at temperatures close
to absolute zero are highly intriguing and are responsible for some of the most interesting eﬀects in the physics of
ultracold gases [26, 69, 70, 71].
In order to understand cold collisions, detailed knowledge about the long-range
behavior of the interatomic interaction potential is indispensable [69].

Here, we concentrate on interactions between two identical alkaline-earth-metal atoms in the same quantum state.
If the two interacting atoms have vanishing angular momentum, J = 0, then at the leading, second-order level of the
long-range expansion of the interaction energy [72, 73, 74], both atoms can only become polarized—and thus reduce
the overall energy of the system—by making virtual electric-dipole transitions to states with J = 1. In this case, the
, separated by distance R, is
electric dipole–dipole dispersion interaction energy between atoms in atomic state
well known to be given by the leading

C6/R6 term, where [72, 73, 74]

For 1S0 atoms, the states

have angular momentum J = 1 and odd parity. The C6 coeﬃcients we calculated
for Mg, Ca, and Sr in the atomic ground state are listed in Table VI. Our numbers can be compared with high-level
ab initio data from Refs. [75] and [76]. The high quality of our results is evident. The monotonic increase of the
C6 coeﬃcient from Mg to Sr is a simple consequence of the greater polarizability of the heavier alkaline-earth-metal
atoms.

More interesting for future experiments with metastable atoms is the long-range physics of the 3P o

0 state. As we
have seen in Table II, in this state the lifetime, under spontaneous emission, of bosonic alkaline-earth-metal atoms is
virtually unlimited. Any quenching of the metastable state will be induced by collisions with either atoms or photons.
It is not clear, for example, on what timescale a gas consisting of 3P o
0 atoms will disintegrate due to inelastic processes,
how these processes can be controlled, or what role elastic collisions have to play. An important ﬁrst step toward an
answer consists again in determining the corresponding C6 coeﬃcient. For 3P o

state atoms, we observe a monotonic dependence of the C6 coeﬃcient on the atomic number. Additionally, it should
be noted that in the 3P o
0 state the C6 coeﬃcients for all three atomic species are greater than in the ground state by
a factor of about 1.5. This expresses the fact that for excited atoms, the relevant energy denominators in Eq. (38)
are smaller on average.

C.

3P o
2

As Derevianko pointed out [27], the very long lifetime (see Sec. III C) of alkaline-earth-metal atoms in the lowest
3P o
2 state makes magnetic trapping of these metastable species experimentally practical. This expectation has turned
out to be correct [29, 30, 31, 32]. However, what ultimately limit the eﬃciency of evaporative cooling in a magnetic
trap are inelastic collisions [35], not radiative decay processes. The strong coupling to inelastic scattering channels is
caused by the anisotropic long-range interactions between the nonspherical 3P o

2 atoms.

The most important parameter in this context is the atomic electric-quadrupole moment [27, 34]. For an atom in

with angular momentum Jm, the electric-quadrupole moment can be written as [34]

vanishes, of course, if Jm = 0 or Jm = 1/2. The atomic electric-quadrupole moment gives rise to direct, ﬁrst-

for 3P o
order quadrupole–quadrupole interactions proportional to 1/R5 [77]. Derevianko was the ﬁrst to calculate
2
alkaline-earth-metal atoms [27]; improved data were published recently [33]. We list the results from Refs. [27] and
[33] together with our calculated values in Table VIII. Again, our model calculations provide data of quality similar
to the data derived from high-level many-body theory, Ref. [33]. The monotonic increase of
with respect to atomic
number reﬂects the increase in spatial extension of the excited np orbital, where n = 3 for Mg, n = 4 for Ca, and
n = 5 for Sr.

Q

The electric dipole–dipole dispersion physics is also more complicated for J = 2 than for J = 0. We introduce

intermediate dispersion coeﬃcients to characterize the dispersion interaction between nonspherical atoms [34]:

In our speciﬁc case of two interacting 3P o
denote even-parity states with angular
momenta J1 and J2, respectively. Both J1 and J2 can vary between 1, 2, and 3, so there are six nontrivial intermediate
dispersion coeﬃcients. They are displayed in Table IX. (The remaining three coeﬃcients can be obtained by simple
sign changes, according to Eq. (40).) Derevianko et al. [33] use intermediate dispersion coeﬃcients deﬁned as

The restriction to long-range expansion terms up to 1/R6 is valid only for interatomic distances of the order of
100 Bohr radii or larger. In this regime, however, energies associated with rotations of the diatomic frame of an
interacting pair are comparable with the interatomic interaction energies, and the coupling between the rotational
and the electronic degrees of freedom induced by the anisotropic interatomic interaction must be explicitly taken into
account. Reference [34] develops a tensorial theory appropriate for this purpose and shows how the parameters
and BJ1J2 enter the theory.

Q

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have theoretically investigated properties of the energetically lowest 3P o manifold in the alkaline-
earth-metal atoms Mg, Ca, and Sr. The latter two, in particular, are the subject of strong current interest. Using an
electron-correlation approach for the valence shell in combination with a physically well-motivated potential for the
valence interaction with the core shells, we have been able to reproduce existing ab initio data with good accuracy.
This provides an independent check on a number of crucial atomic parameters for present-day experiments.

The calculations presented here also supply data that have not, to our knowledge, been presented elsewhere.
First, the E1M1 decay rate of the 3P o
0 state in spinless alkaline-earth-metal species was not previously known. The
diﬀerence in level structure to heliumlike atoms may motivate a direct search for the exotic E1M1 decay process in
heavy magnesiumlike (or berylliumlike) ions. Second, our calculation of the hyperﬁne-induced E1 decay rate of the
3P o
0 state in 43Ca, and also our determination of the magic wavelength for the corresponding clock transition from
the ground state of calcium, may be of interest for the development of a future generation of optical atomic clocks.
Finally, we have calculated the C6 dispersion coeﬃcient describing the long-range interaction between two metastable
3P o
0 alkaline-earth-metal atoms. This system, which is free from any losses due to Penning ionization, may be ideal
for studying cold collisions between spherical, metastable atoms.

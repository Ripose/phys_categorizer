Abstract. The atomic cascades in µ
p and ¯pp atoms have been studied in detail using new results for
the cross-sections of the scattering of highly excited exotic atoms from molecular hydrogen. The cascade
calculations have been done with an updated version of the extended standard cascade model that computes
the evolution in the kinetic energy from the beginning of the cascade. The resulting X-ray yields, kinetic
energy distributions, and cascade times are compared with the experimental data.

1 Introduction

The standard cascade model (SCM) of exotic hydrogen
atoms, originally introduced by Leon and Bethe [1] and
later extended to include the evolution of the kinetic en-
ergy distribution during the atomic cascade [2,3], provides
a fair description of many properties of atomic cascades,
such as the X-ray yields and absorption fractions [4–7].
However, no detailed calculations of the initial stage of
the cascade were done until recently due to the lack of
the corresponding cross-sections. The upper stage of the
cascade was commonly described with a phenomenologi-
cal deexcitation mechanism, the so-called chemical deex-
citation [1]. This mechanism was introduced in order to
explain the data on cascade times, as the external Auger
eﬀect was found to be too slow at the initial stage of the
cascade. The exact nature of the collisional deexcitation of
highly excited exotic atoms remained a mystery for a long
time until experimental studies of the initial stages of the
atomic cascade became possible. Recently the energy dis-
tributions of π−p, µ−p, and µ−d atoms were studied with
various time-of-ﬂight methods [8–12]. In particular, the
measurements performed with µ−p and ¯pp at low density
allow one to probe collisional deexcitation mechanisms for
highly excited states as long as the energy distribution re-
mains frozen during the lower cascade stage dominated by
the radiative transitions.

In our recent paper [13], we studied the dynamics of
collisional deexcitation of highly excited exotic atoms us-
ing the classical-trajectory Monte Carlo method. The Coulomb
transitions with large change of principal quantum num-
ber n were found to be the dominant collisional deexcita-
tion mechanism at high n, with the molecular structure of
the hydrogen target being essential for the dominance of
transitions with large ∆n. The main goal of this paper is

to investigate the atomic cascades in hydrogen-like atoms
at low density and to confront the theoretical results with
the experimental data on the X-ray yields, cascade times,
and kinetic energy distributions for muonic and antipro-
tonic hydrogen. As the lower part of the atomic cascade
at low target densities is mainly dominated by the radia-
tive deexcitation, the results of our calculations are only
weakly aﬀected by theoretical uncertainties in the colli-
sional cross-sections for the low n states. The detailed cas-
cade calculations for high density targets will be published
elsewhere.

The paper is organized as follows. The cascade model is
described in Section 2. The results of the cascade calcula-
tions for the µ−p and ¯pp atoms are presented in Section 3.
The conclusions are summarized in Section 4.

2 The extended standard cascade model

2.1 Overview

The extended standard cascade model (ESCM) is a ki-
netics model that includes all cascade processes of the
standard cascade model [1, 4, 7]: the radiative, Auger, and
Coulomb deexcitation, Stark mixing, and, in case of hadronic
atoms, nuclear absorption (see Table 1 and references therein).
In addition, the ESCM also takes into account the inter-
action between internal and external degrees of freedom of
the exotic atom: the kinetic energy distribution changes
during the cascade due to the acceleration and deceler-
ation mechanisms [2, 3, 14, 15]. The new results for the
collisional processes presented in [13, 16] are used in the
present version of the ESCM, a signiﬁcant improvement
over the previous calculations.

Table 1. Processes included in the extended standard cascade model.

The cascade in exotic atoms is divided into two parts:
the classical domain for high n and the quantum mechani-
cal domain for low n. The x−p can be described classically
for quantum numbers n ≫ 1, and for convenience we use
the properties of the Auger deexcitation to deﬁne the n-
ranges of the two domains. The Auger deexcitation rates
are known to have a maximum for n = nc where nc is the
largest n for which the binding energy released in a ∆n = 1
transition is enough to ionize the H2 molecule [1, 13, 19]:
nc = 7 for µ−p and nc = 12 for ¯pp. Our calculations show
that the Coulomb deexcitation dominates the Auger de-
excitation for n > nc [13]. We deﬁne the classical domain
by the conditions n > nc. The classical domain, where
the processes were calculated in the classical Monte Carlo
(CMC) model with the molecular structure of the target
taken into account, will be discussed in Section 2.2. In the
quantum mechanical domain, n ≤ nc, the close-coupling
method and semiclassical approximations [16, 17, 21] were
used to calculate the diﬀerential cross-sections, dσ/d cos θ,
of the collisional processes

(x−p)nl + H → (x−p)nl′ + H

and the cross-sections for absorption during collision and
Auger transitions

Another approximation used in this paper is related
to the Auger deexcitation because the eikonal approxima-
tion [13] does not give the diﬀerential cross-section and
the distribution over ﬁnal l. Here we use the diﬀerential
cross-section for the l-average Stark and elastic transitions
and a statistical distribution over ﬁnal l.

Concerning the acceleration mechanisms, the present
calculations include Coulomb deexcitation through the whole
cascade. For high n states, the classical-trajectory Monte
Carlo method [13] was used to obtain the cross-sections of
the inelastic collisions

(x−p)ni + H2 → (x−p)nf + X, X = H2, H∗

2, H + H.(4)

For low n, where the classical-trajectory method cannot
be expected to give reliable results, we parameterize the
Coulomb deexcitation cross-section as follows1

in an energy range relevant for atomic cascade. The new
calculations allow us to describe the competition between
deceleration and Stark mixing, as well as the absorption in
hadronic atoms due to Stark collisions, without employing
any ﬁtting parameters related to the Stark mixing and
deceleration, like kStk used in many earlier calculations [4].
Our cascade code makes full use of the diﬀerential cross-
sections so that the kinetics is treated more accurately
than in cascade models using continuous deceleration [22].
The diﬀerential cross sections used in the present cas-
cade model in the case of muonic hydrogen were calculated
in the fully quantum mechanical close-coupling framework
for n = 2 − 5 and in the semiclassical approximation for
n = 6 − 7. The statistically weighted diﬀerential cross-
sections were used for n ≥ 6. In antiprotonic hydrogen,
the fully quantum mechanical results are not yet available
below the ns thresholds. Therefore, we used the results of
the semiclassical model in the range n = 2 − 9 and the
ﬁxed ﬁeld model for n = 10 − 12.

which gives a fair description of the Coulomb cross-sections
of Bracci and Fiorentini [23] for n ≤ 7.

Other calculations [24–26] predict signiﬁcantly smaller
Coulomb deexcitation rates than [23]. However, the rapid
increase in the Coulomb cross-sections for energies ap-
proaching zero is predicted by all models. The dependence
on the reduced mass is based on an estimate in [23] and
our classical Monte Carlo calculations conﬁrm that it is
a fair approximation. We assume, furthermore, that only
∆n = 1 transitions are important at low n, the distribu-
tion over ﬁnal l is statistical, and the angular distribu-
tion is isotropic. As long as the mechanism responsible for

1 The n = 2 state in muonic hydrogen is, however, treated
diﬀerently. Coulomb deexcitation is assumed only to take place
in the 2s state and only when the kinetic energy is below the
2p threshold. In this case we use the measured Coulomb de-
−1 [12] where N is the

Coulomb deexcitation at low n is not fully understood2,
this process enters as a major uncertainty in calculations
of the kinetic energy evolution at low n. In this paper we
restrict the cascade calculations to observables that are
not very sensitive to the Coulomb deexcitation at low n. In
the case of kinetic energy distributions this usually means
low densities. Other observables, like the X-ray yields in
µ−p and cascade times, are less sensitive to the Coulomb
deexcitation at low n.

Figures 1 and 2 show an overview of the cascade rates
at 10−4 LHD in muonic and antiprotonic hydrogen calcu-
lated in the classical-trajectory model with molecular tar-
get and in semiclassical approximations with atomic tar-
get. The absorption rate in antiprotonic hydrogen shows
only the absorption from the ns states during collisions.
Cascade calculations show, in agreement with the exper-
imental results [29], that absorption at densities below
10−3 LHD takes place mainly from the p states.

2.2 Classical-trajectory Monte Carlo model in the
cascade calculations

The classical-trajectory Monte Carlo calculations have been
included in the cascade calculations by using two diﬀerent
methods. The earlier versions of the cascade model [14]
was based on the explicit use of the cross-sections [13]
with the following initial conditions. A discrete set of 9
initial kinetic energies in the interval 0.05 eV ≤ T ≤ 20 eV
was used, and the initial principal quantum numbers were

taken in the range 8 ≤ ni ≤ 20 for µ−p and 13 ≤ ni ≤ 35
for ¯pp. For each combination of laboratory kinetic energies
T and principal quantum numbers ni, the classical trajec-
tories were calculated using the statistical distribution in
quantum number li as the initial condition. The diﬀer-
ential cross-sections dσ/d cos θ were calculated separately
for the three groups of reactions:



The eﬀect of excitation and dissociation of the hydrogen
molecule in Coulomb deexcitations were taken into ac-
count by distributing the ﬁnal kinetic energies of the three
atoms (x−p and two H) in the CMS according to the clas-
sical phase space. This approximation agrees fairly well
with the calculations [13].

More detailed initial and ﬁnal states are used in the
present cascade model where several trajectories (21 for
µ−p and 6 for ¯pp) were calculated for each combination
of the quantum numbers ni (in the range given above)
and li = 0, .., ni − 1, and 31 kinetic energy points in the
range 0.3 − 32 eV. In muonic hydrogen this gives a total
of 118482 trajectories. The range of impact parameters
was divided into three intervals, (0; 2a0), (2a0; 4a0), and
(4a0; 7a0), with a third of the collisions in each and the
trajectories uniformly distributed in ρ2. For each trajec-
tory, the ﬁnal quantum numbers nf and lf , and the ﬁnal
laboratory kinetic energy Tf were stored. The resulting
lists of transitions in the form

with the weights of the impact parameter intervals prop-
erly taken into account, were used directly by the cascade
program by redirecting the ﬁnal state to the initial state of
the next collision. We consider this method as more accu-
rate than the earlier used method for cascade calculations
in the upper part of the cascade.

2.3 Initial conditions

The initial conditions for the cascade calculations are de-
ﬁned by the initial distributions in the quantum numbers
n and l and the laboratory kinetic energy T of the x−p.
In the simplest picture, the x− is captured by the pro-
ton after ionization of the hydrogen atom in a state with
large overlap with the 1s electron wave function; this gives
µxp/me (∼ 14 for muonic and ∼ 30 for antipro-
ni ∼
tonic hydrogen). More elaborate calculations, which takes
the molecular structure of the target into account, predict
distributions in the initial n which peak at lower values:
for example, the maximum at n = 11 for muonic hydro-
gen [30]. A shift towards lower initial n values is also found
in [31]. The new experimental data on muonic hydrogen
kinetic energy distributions from PSI are sensitive to the
initial distributions as discussed below in Section 3.1.4.

p

Unless otherwise indicated, we use the initial principal
quantum number ni = 14 for µ−p and ni = 30 for ¯pp and
the initial kinetic energy given by a Maxwell distribution

At target densities above 10−7 LHD, the lifetime of the
2s state depends on the kinetic energy of the µ−p. Below
the 2p threshold, T2p = 0.3 eV, the 2s state is long-lived
because 2s → 2p Stark transitions followed by the fast
radiative deexcitation 2p → 1s are energetically forbid-
den. The induced radiative transition can, however, occur
during collisions, see [41, 42] and below. For kinetic ener-
gies above the 2p threshold the collisions with the target
molecules lead to a competition between deceleration and
depletion via 2s → 2p Stark transitions followed by the
2p → 1s radiative transition. The metastable 2s fraction,
R2s, is deﬁned as the fraction of all created µ−p atoms
which end up in the 2s state with kinetic energies below
T2p.

Before we present the results of our full cascade model,
it is illuminating to consider the problem of the metastable
2s fraction in a simpliﬁed framework. The metastable 2s
fraction consists of the µ−p that are formed with kinetic
energies below T2p and those that are formed with kinetic
energies above T2p but slow down below threshold due to
elastic collisions. The median kinetic energy at 1 mbar is
1.5 eV [12], so the deceleration process is important. This
leads to the deﬁnition of the surviving metastable fraction,
f (T ), which is the probability that the µ−p atom in the 2s
state with initial kinetic energy T reaches energies below
the 2s threshold by slowing down in elastic collisions [21].
In the approximation of continuous energy loss the evo-

lution in the kinetic energy is given by

3 Results

3.1 Muonic hydrogen

The cascade calculations in muonic hydrogen have been
done in the density range (10−8 − 1) LHD using various
initial conditions. The results are compared with the ex-
perimental data for the metastable 2s population, X-ray
yields, cascade times, and kinetic energy distributions [12,
32–37, 39, 43].

3.1.1 The metastable 2s fraction

The metastable 2s state of muonic hydrogen is of great in-
terest because it allows, under certain conditions, to mea-
sure the µ−p Lamb shift, 2s − 2p, from which the proton
charge radius can be determined with high precision [38].
The feasibility of this experiment, presently in progress at
PSI [39], relies on a sizeable fraction of muonic hydrogen
atoms in the 2s state with a suﬃciently long lifetime. In
the absence of collisions, the lifetime of the 2s state is de-
termined by the muon lifetime (τµ = 2 · 10−6 s) as the rate
for the 2s → 1s two-photon transition is negligibly small.

It was found that a sizeable fraction of (µ−p)2s atoms

To provide a more realistic treatment of the evolution
in kinetic energy we use a Monte Carlo program based
on the diﬀerential cross-sections for the four processes
2s → 2s, 2s → 2p, 2p → 2s and 2p → 2p. In addition
to the collisional processes, the 2p → 1s radiative transi-
tion is also included in the calculation. The fate of a µ−p
formed in the 2s state with kinetic energy T is thus either
to undergo 2p → 1s radiative transition after the Stark
mixing 2s → 2p or to end up in the 2s state with kinetic
energy below the threshold with probability f (T ).

Figure 3 shows the surviving metastable fraction, f (T ),

sity 10−6 LHD < N < 10−2 LHD. The approximation (12)
gives somewhat higher values for the survival probability
than the exact kinetics calculation at T < 1.4 eV. The

Monte Carlo results at high energies (T > 1.5 eV) are sig-
niﬁcantly larger than those obtained from Equation (12)
where continuous energy loss is assumed. The reason is
that there is a signiﬁcant contribution to f (T ) from large-
angle scattering. The result of [40] is considerably smaller
than the present result due to diﬀerences in the cross-
sections and the fact that in [40] the molecular hydrogen
mass was used instead of the atomic one in order to get
the correct value for the threshold. By using the surviving
metastable fraction f (T ), the measured kinetic energy dis-
tributions on arrival in the 1s state [12], and the 2s arrival
probability3 [34], one ﬁnds the metastable 2s fraction to
be ∼ 1% in the pressure region 0.06−16 mbar as discussed
in [12].

After reaching thermal energies the (µ−p)2s atoms may
undergo radiative deexcitation during collisions because of
the Stark eﬀect [41, 42]:

(µ−p)2s+H → (µ−p)2s−2p+H → (µ−p)1s+γ(1.9 keV)+H.
(13)
The radiative quenching of thermal (µ−p)2s atoms would
result in delayed Kα X-rays. However, the experiments [32–
34] have not observed this eﬀect. This apparent contra-
diction was recently resolved by the µ−p diﬀusion experi-
ment [12,43] where 0.9 keV (µ−p)1s atoms, resulting from
the Coulomb deexcitation process

(µ−p)2s + H → (µ−p)1s(0.9 keV) + H(1.0 keV),

(14)

were found. The measured non-radiative quenching rate
is about 2 µs−1 at 1 mbar [12, 43] which is more than an
order of magnitude larger than the theoretical predictions
for the radiative quenching rate [41, 42].

The 2s arrival probability, ǫ2s, and metastable 2s frac-
tion calculated in the ESCM with the initial conditions
speciﬁed in Section 2.3 is shown in Figure 4. The cal-
culated 2s arrival probability is in good agreement with
the experimental data obtained from measurements of X-
ray yields [32–34]. The arrival probability ǫ2s increases
steadily with increasing density from 1% at 10−7 LHD
to 25% in liquid hydrogen. This behavior has a simple
qualitative explanation: at the lowest densities the cas-
cade proceeds purely radiatively from high n values. As
only ∆l = 1 transitions are allowed, the circular states
are predominantly populated for low n. The majority of
exotic atoms, therefore, go through the radiative 2p → 1s
transition without reaching the 2s state. With the density
increasing the Stark mixing becomes eﬃcient at lower n
levels and more np → 2s radiative transitions take place.
In liquid hydrogen, ǫ2s is given by the statistical weight of
the 2s state.

In the density range 10−7 − 10−4 LHD, the calcu-
lated metastable fraction increases from 0.7% to 2%, and
this is in perfect agreement with the experimental re-
sult [12] obtained in measurements of 0.9 keV (µ−p)1s

3 The 2s arrival probability is the fraction of formed exotic
atoms that arrives at the n = 2 level in the 2s state. It can
be estimated from measurements of K X-ray yields using the
known Ynp→2s/Ynp→1s branching ratios.

sity until about 0.01 LHD. Above 0.01 LHD the growth
becomes faster and R2s reaches 65% in liquid hydrogen.
The large metastable fraction at high densities is a conse-
quence of the dominance of the slowing down in 2li → 2lf
collisions over the radiative 2p → 1s deexcitation.

lation, P2s, at 1 mbar. The 2s population grows rapidly
with time in the beginning of the cascade and reaches
a maximum of 1.2% after 0.1 µs. The development at
later times clearly shows the two components of P2s. The
short-lived component consists of the µ−p atoms with ki-
netic energies above the threshold, T2p, which go through
the 2s → 2p Stark transition followed by the radiative

minated after 0.7 µs: the µ−p atoms are either in the 1s
state or the metastable 2s state. The metastable 2s state
is quenched non-radiatively (14) with a rate at 1 mbar of
about 4 times the rate for muon decay.

The results in Figure 5 were calculated under the as-
sumption that all µ−p atoms were formed at the same
time. In reality, the muons are injected into the target,
slow down in collisions with the H2 molecules, and are then
captured by a proton. Having to go through the slowing
down process means that the time of formation is given
by a density dependent distribution — the so-called stop
time distribution. The measured stop time at 1 mbar is
τstop = 0.48±0.13 µs [12] which, when taken into account,
does not change the overall features of Figure 5 except for
the time oﬀset.

The results for the 2s population are extremely impor-
tant for the 2s − 2p Lamb shift experiment [38,39]. In this
experiment, a laser will be used to induce 2s → 2p tran-
sitions which are followed by the fast radiative 2p → 1s
deexcitation. The Kα X-rays are detected in coincidence
with the laser pulse and the 2s − 2p energy splitting is
then deduced from the laser wavelength corresponding to
the strongest Kα signal. This laser experiment is feasible
provided the 2s population is not too small and the Kα
background produced by the cascade is negligible. These
conditions are fulﬁlled at very low densities (around a few
mbar) after a short delay time as discussed above.

The calculated relative X-ray yields for the µ−p atom are

yield is higher than 90% at 10−7 LHD, it decreases with
the density increasing and reaches a minimum of 50% at
2 · 10−3 LHD. Above 2 · 10−3 LHD the relative Kα yield
increases and ends at 94% in liquid hydrogen. The op-
posite behavior is seen in the other K yields. They start
out close to zero at 10−7 LHD, increase with the density
and reach their maxima (at 0.01 LHD for Kβ, 10−3 LHD
for Kγ, and 3 · 10−4 LHD for Kδ), and, with the excep-
tion of Kβ, practically vanish at LHD. The density de-
pendence of the yields can be explained qualitatively in a
way similar to the discussion of the 2s population above.
At 10−7 LHD the cascade is almost purely radiative and
proceeds at low n through the circular states, so that al-
most all µ−p atoms go through the radiative 2p → 1s
transition whereas the transitions np → 1s with n > 2 are
much weaker. With increasing density the Stark mixing
becomes more eﬃcient and leads to higher populations of
the np states with n > 2. This explains the increase in the

relative K≥β yields and consequently also the decrease in
Kα. The decrease in the K≥β yields for higher densities is
due to the collisional deexcitation n → n − 1 which begin
to dominate the radiative transitions.

At high density, a signiﬁcant fraction of the µ−p atoms
slows down at the very end of the cascade before reach-
ing the ground state and populate the metastable 2s state
with high probability (R2s ≈ 0.65 in liquid hydrogen) as
discussed above. This makes the ratio of Kα and Kβ yields
in liquid hydrogen very sensitive to a quenching mecha-
nism of the 2s state. As demonstrated in Figure 7, the
X-ray data favor non-radiative quenching (14) in agree-
ment with the recent experiment on direct search for the
metastable 2s state [12]. It would be very important to
check this result directly by measuring the absolute X-
ray yield in liquid hydrogen: the non-radiative quench-
ing leads to a signiﬁcant suppression of the X-ray yield:
Y (Ktot) ≈ 0.35.

3.1.3 Cascade time

The cascade time in muonic hydrogen at low pressures
(0.25-16 mbar) was measured recently in the (µ−p)1s dif-
fusion experiment at PSI [12]. The experimentally mea-
sured value is the so-called partial cascade time that is
deﬁned as the time between formation of the µ−p and
the last “signiﬁcant” collision during the cascade, and is,
therefore, smaller than the cascade time usually deﬁned
as the time between formation and arrival in the ground
state. The exact deﬁnition of the measured partial cascade
time is contained in a non-trivial way in the data analy-
sis program of [12]; we can approximate it by deﬁning a
collision to be “signiﬁcant” if the relative change in µ−p
kinetic energy is larger than δ which we vary in the range
0.1 − 0.3. The calculated cascade time and partial cascade
time are shown in Figure 8 in comparison with the exper-
imental data [12]. Whereas the cascade time grows as the
pressure decreases and eventually reaches the purely ra-
diative cascade time, the partial cascade time reaches its
maximum at 2 · 10−7 LHD and vanishes at zero pressure
where there are no collisions. The calculated partial cas-
cade time depends only weakly on δ, and our results are
in good agreement with the experiment.

The n dependence of the partial cascade time at 0.25
and 4 mbar is shown in Figure 9. At 4 mbar, the partial
cascade time depends only weakly on the initial n and
is in perfect agreement with the experimental result for
n > 10. The calculated partial cascade time at 0.25 mbar
has a moderate dependence on n and agrees with the ex-
periment for n = 13 − 15. Though this seems to support
the simple picture of the µ−p atoms being formed with
n ∼ 14, the models that predict lower values for the ini-
tial n can also be consistent with the experiment because
the n distributions usually have tails that extends up to
high values. For example, using the the n distribution for
molecular target from [30] we obtain the partial cascade
time τcasc = 60 ns at 0.25 mbar in good agreement with
the measured τcasc = 74 ± 15 ns [12].

3.1.4 Kinetic energy distribution

The kinetic energy distribution of muonic hydrogen atoms
on arrival in the 1s state has been obtained by analyzing
µ−p diﬀusion times in hydrogen gas [9, 11, 12, 39]. The in-
tegrated kinetic energy distribution4 of muonic hydrogen

initial stages of the cascade. Figure 10 shows the inte-
grated kinetic energy distribution calculated in the cas-
cade model and the experimental data from [12]. The data
at 0.06 mbar are sensitive mainly to the initial energy dis-
tribution. With the density increasing, the role of the colli-
sional processes grows, and the ﬁnal distribution becomes
more energetic due to acceleration at the beginning of the
cascade. The results of the cascade calculations are in a
fair agreement with the data for the initial conditions spec-
iﬁed in Section 2.3. The Coulomb transitions with ∆n > 1
were found to be essential for explaining the observed in-
crease in kinetic energy with increasing pressure in agree-
ment with the earlier analysis [11]. Similar cascade calcu-
lations using the trajectories of µ−p collisions with atomic
hydrogen, where the collisions with ∆n = 1 dominate the
collisional deexcitation, predict a much weaker increase in
kinetic energy as shown in Figure 11.

The cascade calculations predict, independent of the
initial n, signiﬁcantly smaller fractions of (µ−p)1s atoms
with high kinetic energies (T ≥ 8 eV) at pressures above
4 mbar than the experimental data.

Figure 12 shows the density dependence of W (1 eV)
and W (8 eV). The calculated sub-1 eV fraction, W (1 eV),
decreases from 80% at 0.06 mbar to 30% at 16 mbar in
good agreement with the experimental data [12]. The µ−p
atoms with energies above 8 eV are produced during the
cascade in Coulomb transitions. The present calculations
predict an increase in W (T ≥ 8 eV) with the pressure
from 1% at 0.06 mbar to 17% at 16 mbar. The predicted
curves agree with the experimental results in the range
0.06 − 1 mbar whereas the measured high energy fraction
is substantially larger than calculated one for pressures
above 4 mbar: for example W (T ≥ 8 eV) = (22.5 ± 0.9)%
at 16 mbar [12]. The measured increase in the high energy
fraction of (µ−p)1s atoms cannot be reproduced in the
current cascade model for any initial distribution.

for diﬀerent initial conditions. With the density increas-
ing the calculated median energies grow and reach 2.5 eV
around 10−5 LHD. Above 10−5 LHD, the median energies
remain nearly constant up to 2 · 10−4 LHD where they
start to grow again. The shape of the curves can be ex-
plained as follows. The increase in the median energies at
low densities is produced in the classical domain (n > 7)
where the acceleration due to Coulomb transitions with
∆n = 1 − 5 is more eﬃcient than the slowing down. The
plateau is due to the dominance of Auger deexcitation
at medium n which become important around the den-
sity 10−5 LHD. The increase in the median energy in the
uppermost part of the shown density range is produced
by the Coulomb transitions at n < 8. For densities larger
than 10−4 LHD, the initial kinetic energy is almost forgot-
ten because of the many collisions during the cascade, and
the kinetic energy distribution at the end of the cascade is

The present study of the atomic cascade in antiprotonic
hydrogen was focused on the experimental data obtained
at low density [45–50].

determined by the competition between acceleration and
deceleration during the cascade.

The measured density dependence of the median ki-
netic energy is well reproduced with the initial conditions:
T0 = 0.5 eV and ni = 14 or T0 = 0.25 eV and ni = 16. For
ni = 12 (Figure 13) the initial acceleration appears to be
weaker and the agreement with the experimental result is
worse. The molecular structure of the target is essential
for explaining the data. Calculations with the CMC tra-
jectories for atomic hydrogen leads to a too weak increase
in the median energy compared to the experiment.

We estimate the statistical errors due to the ﬁnite num-
ber of CMC trajectories by dividing the 21 complete sets
of trajectories into 7 subsets and calculate the observables
using each subset. The results for the median kinetic en-
ergy and the integrated kinetic energy shown in Table 2

3.2.1 X-ray yields

The calculated X-ray yields are in a good agreement with
the data [46–49] as shown in Figures 16 and 17. In addi-
tion to the data on absolute X-ray yields, there are more
precise measurements of relative yields, see Table 3. The
theoretical results are in fair agreement with the data as
all the calculated ratios deviate less than 50% from the
experimental results. This is a signiﬁcant improvement in
comparison with the calculations in the Borie-Leon model
reported in [48]: the two standard tuning parameters kStk
and T were ﬁxed by ﬁtting the absolute Lα yields but the
predictions of the model for ratios involving Lδ were a fac-
tor of 3 − 5 larger than the experimental data. We stress
that our results were obtained without employing any cas-
cade tuning parameters. Figure 18 shows an example of

the hadronic broadening of the 1s state, only the Kα line
is clearly separable from the rest of the K lines of which
the 9p → 1s transition has the highest intensity. The rela-
tively large contribution to the K yield from high n states
is due to the strong absorption in the excited states which
prevents most of the ¯pp atoms from reaching the low n
states.

The density dependence of the cascade time is shown in
Figure 19. Our result is in good agreement with the data
[45] except for the data point at 150 mbar where our model
predicts signiﬁcantly shorter cascade time. The agreement
for pressures up to 10 mbar can be considered as an impor-
tant conﬁrmation of the dominance of the Coulomb transi-
tions with large changes in the principal quantum number

calculations [5] predicted much higher cascade times in
variance with the experimental data.

The dependence of the cascade time at 3.4 and 9.8 mbar
on the initial n is shown in Figure 20. There is good
agreement with the experimental result [45] in the range
n = 25 − 35. Calculations also show that the calculated
cascade times depend only weakly on the initial kinetic
energy.

3.2.3 Kinetic energy distributions

In the upper part of the cascade most of the ¯pp atoms
are accelerated to energies of several eV in the Coulomb
transitions with ∆n > 1. Figure 21 shows the density de-
pendence of the median energy at the instant of nuclear
absorption calculated for initial n = 20, 25, 30. The shape
of the curves are similar to those of muonic hydrogen but
the energy is higher. The median energy increases rapidly
with increasing density and reaches 6−7 eV at 10−5 LHD.
At higher densities the dominance of the Auger transi-
tions at intermediate n prevents further increase until the
Coulomb deexcitation at low n becomes important.

3.2.4 Doppler broadening of the L lines

The acceleration processes during the atomic cascade lead
to a sizeable Doppler broadening of the L lines. Figure 22
shows the integrated energy distribution of the ¯pp atoms
at the instant of the 3d → 2p transition in a gaseous target
of 22 mbar, the median energy being about 6.5 eV. The
corresponding Doppler broadening of the 3d → 2p line
proﬁle is shown in Figure 23; the eﬀect gives a signiﬁcant
contribution to the width and must, therefore, be taken
into account in the analysis of the X-ray spectra. In the
data analysis in [50] it was assumed that the ¯pp atoms
were thermalized due to elastic and Auger collisions.

4 Conclusions

Using the new results for the collisional processes [13, 16],
the atomic cascades in muonic and antiprotonic hydrogen
have been have been studied in detail. The cascade cal-
culations have been done in the extended standard cas-
cade model which describes the evolution in the quantum
numbers n and l and the kinetic energy from the very be-
ginning of the cascade. By taking deceleration and accel-
eration during the cascade into account, observables can
be predicted reliably without the need for any cascade

the high energy fraction of the kinetic energy distribution
in muonic hydrogen deserves special attention in future
studies: the ESCM predicts a much smaller fraction of µ−p
atoms with energies above 16 eV at 4 and 16 mbar than the
experimental result [12]. This disagreement indicates that
some processes beyond the ESCM are important. Can-
didates under discussion are the hybrid Auger-Coulomb
transitions [53] and the resonant formation of molecular
states [28].

Future development of the ESCM will consist of calcu-
lations of the above mentioned processes and their inclu-
sion in the cascade model. At the same time the cascade
calculations can be easily extended to cover exotic deu-
terium atoms and H-D mixtures. Further critical tests of
the current theory of the atomic cascade will greatly ben-
eﬁt from the results of the experiments on the precision
spectroscopy of pionic and muonic hydrogen, presently in
progress at PSI.

tuning parameters. The extended standard cascade model
successfully describes a number of experimental results:
X-ray yields, cascade times, and kinetic energy distribu-
tions. The results of the cascade calculations for muonic
and antiprotonic hydrogen can be summarized as follows:

– Muonic hydrogen. The calculated X-ray yields in muonic
hydrogen are in good agreement with the data. The
measured ratio of the Kα and Kβ yields in liquid hy-
drogen can be reproduced only if the non-radiative
quenching of the metastable 2s state is dominant. The
calculated increase in the (µ−p)1s median kinetic en-
ergy with the density is in agreement with the data [12]
for the initial conditions corresponding to kinetic en-
ergies around 0.5 eV and principal quantum number
n ≈ 14. The molecular structure of the target is essen-
tial for explaining the data on the density dependence
of the kinetic energy distribution at the end of the cas-
cade.

– Antiprotonic hydrogen. The calculated K and L X-ray
yields in antiprotonic hydrogen are in good agreement
with the data. The calculated cascade time is in good
agreement with the data. For the ﬁrst time, a good
description of the data is obtained without using any
phenomenological tuning parameters. The fast colli-
sional deexcitation at high n calculated in the classical-
trajectory model was found to be very important for
explaining the short cascade times measured by the
OBELIX collaboration [45]. The acceleration of the ¯pp
during the initial stages of the cascade predicted by our
cascade model results in a signiﬁcant Doppler broad-
ening of the L lines. This must be taken into account
when hadronic widths and shifts are obtained from the
measured line proﬁles.

Some experimental data cannot be explained in the
present version of the ESCM even with taking the uncer-
tainties in the cross-sections into account. The problem of

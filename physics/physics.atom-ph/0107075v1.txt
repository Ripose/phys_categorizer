Abstract We present the ﬁrst simultaneous trapping
of two diﬀerent ultracold atomic species in a conserva-
tive trap. Lithium and cesium atoms are stored in an
optical dipole trap formed by the focus of a CO2 laser.
Techniques for loading both species of atoms are dis-
cussed and observations of elastic and inelastic collisions
between the two species are presented. A model for sym-
pathetic cooling of two species with strongly diﬀerent
mass in the presence of slow evaporation is developed.
From the observed Cs-induced evaporation of Li atoms
we estimate a cross section for cold elastic Li-Cs colli-
sions.

1 Introduction

Mixtures of ultracold atoms add many new possibilities
to the study of interactions in ultracold gases since the
diﬀerent components of the mixture can have widely dif-
ferent intrinsic properties, e.g., diﬀerent masses, spins,
scattering properties and quantum statistics. On one
hand, many interesting phenomena are exclusive to gas
mixtures, such as mixing and de-mixing phenomena [1,
2], the subtle interplay between bosonic and fermionic
atoms [3], or the prospect of forming ultracold heteronu-
clear molecules through photoassociation [4]. On the other
hand, one may see an atomic gas mixture as a tool for
transferring the favorable thermodynamic properties of
one component (low temperature, high magnetization)
to the other component. In this case one would like to
use one gas that is easy to cool or polarize, and bring it in
contact with a second gas that is harder to handle. These
processes are commonly referred to as sympathetic cool-
ing and polarization exchange.

Already 15 years ago, cryogenically cooled helium
was used as a buﬀer gas to precool and load atomic
hydrogen into a magnetic trap [5]. More recently, this
method was extended to other atomic species and even
molecules [6]. Sympathetic cooling with ultracold, trapped
gases has initially been studied for diﬀerent hyperﬁne
states of evaporatively cooled rubidium atoms in or-
der to create two overlapping Bose-Einstein Condensates
(BECs) [7]. Later, evaporative cooling of a mixture of
magnetic spin states was employed as the key step to
create a degenerate Fermi gas of fermionic 40K [8]. Most
recently, sympathetic cooling in magnetic traps has been
applied to diﬀerent isotopes of the same atomic species:
the bosonic species 85Rb cooled by 87Rb [9] and the
fermionic 6Li cooled by 7Li [10,11]. So far, no experi-
ments are reported which investigate elastic interactions
in two distinct atomic species.

Sympathetic cooling of a mixture of diﬀerent atomic
species in principle oﬀers an enormous advantage if one
species can be optically cooled to much lower tempera-
tures than the other. We are investigating a mixture of
the alkaline atoms lithium and cesium. This combination
represents the prototype of a mixture in which one com-
ponent (lithium) is hard to cool optically while the other
(cesium) allows sub-Doppler temperatures ( < 3 µK in
free space) to be reached by simple polarization-gradient
cooling. In contrast to evaporative cooling, the cooling
process does not lead to a signiﬁcant loss of either the
cooled gas or the cooling agent. Sympathetic cooling
with cesium (or other sub-Doppler cooled atoms) may
be the method of choice for cooling many other atomic
and molecular species, including LiCs molecules formed
by photoassociation from the same mixed-species sam-
ple!

We present the ﬁrst observation of simultaneous trap-
ping of two diﬀerent atomic species in a conservative
trap: lithium and cesium atoms stored in a very far-
detuned optical dipole trap. Our optical trap is based
on a CO2 laser emitting light at 10.6 µm [17]. The trap
provides a conservative potential which is independent of

the hyperﬁne state and spin projection of the atoms [18].
This allows us to study exoergic spin exchange collisions
as well as elastic interactions. Exoergic collisions be-
tween diﬀerent species have been previously investigated
in light-pressure traps [12,13,14] but the near-resonant
light is known to inﬂuence the cross-sections even for
collisions involving only the ground state [15]. No previ-
ous measurements of two-species collision cross-sections
in conservative traps exist. If all atoms are in the lower
hyperﬁne state, exoergic collisions are impossible. We
nevertheless see slow evaporation of lithium, which is an
indication that thermalization through elastic collisions
is taking place. To interpret this evaporation and to es-
timate a collison cross section from it, we adapt a model
given in Ref. [16] and we develop a rate equation model
for sympathetic cooling with slow evaporation.

This paper is organized as follows: An overview of
the apparatus is given in section 2 and the methods for
loading and characterization of the trap are discussed
in section 3. The exoergic spin-changing collisions are
studied in section 4. Finally, a rate equation model for
sympathetic cooling is given in section 5, and compared
to numerical results and experimental data.

2 Quasi-electrostatic trap

The focus of a CO2 laser beam constitutes an almost
perfect realization of a conservative trapping potential
for atoms. The atoms experience an optical dipole force
which points towards the maximum of the intensity thus
providing stable conﬁnement in all spatial directions.
Since the frequency of the CO2 laser is far below any
dipole-allowed atomic transition frequency, the induced
atomic dipole moment oscillates in phase with the os-
cillating electric ﬁeld of the laser as if the ﬁeld was a
slowly varying static ﬁeld. Therefore, the name quasi-
electrostatic trap (QUEST) has been coined for this par-
ticular realization of an optical dipole trap. Due to the
large detuning of the laser frequency from any atomic
resonances, heating through photon scattering can be
completely neglected.

For an intensity distribution I(r) the potential U (r)
is given by U (r) =
αstatI(r)/2ε0c where αstat denotes
the static polarizability of the atoms [17,18]. For a fo-
cused beam of power P and waist w one gets a trap depth
ǫt = 2αstatP/(πε0cw2). We employ an industrial, sealed-
tube CO2 laser (Synrad Evolution) providing 140 W of
power in a nearly TEM00 transversal mode character-
ized by M 2 = 1.2. The laser beam is ﬁrst expanded by
a telescope, and then focused into the vacuum chamber
by a lens of 254 mm focal length. The focus has a waist
of 85 µm, yielding a trap depth of 390 µK for Li and
1000 µK for Cs (in units of the Boltzmann constant kB).
Assuming a pure Gaussian beam, one ﬁnds a Rayleigh
range zR of 1.5 mm. The axial and radial oscillation fre-
quencies in the harmonic approximation are given by

denoting the mass of the atom.

Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of the apparatus. Atoms
are transferred into the dipole trap from magneto-optical
traps (MOT) for lithium and cesium which are superim-
posed on the focus of the CO2 laser beam. Both MOTs
are loaded from atomic beams that are cooled and decel-
erated by decreasing-ﬁeld Zeeman slowers which use the
fringe ﬁelds of the MOT magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld for
the ﬁnal deceleration stage. Fluorescence of the atoms
in the MOT is detected by photodiodes with appropri-
ate ﬁlters to discriminate the resonance ﬂuorescence of
Li at 671 nm from the ﬂuorescence of cesium at 852 nm.
The main vacuum chamber at a background pressure of
10−11 mbar is connected to the oven chambers
about 6
by tubes which are divided into diﬀerentially-pumped
sections. Both atomic beams can be interrupted by me-
chanical shutters.

3.1 Cesium

2 ΓCs to

To load cesium into the QUEST, a cloud of typically 107
atoms is ﬁrst accumulated in the MOT with a quadrupole
ﬁeld gradient of 26 G/cm along the symmetry axis. The
atoms are further compressed and cooled by decreasing
the detuning of the MOT trapping laser from initially
25ΓCs with respect to the 62S1/2(F = 4) -
−
62P3/2(F = 5) transition (natural linewidth ΓCs/2π =
5.3 MHz). After 5 ms of compression, the distribution of
atoms in the MOT has a rms radius of 400 µm corre-
sponding to an mean density of about 1010 atoms/cm3.
After the compression, the magnetic ﬁeld of the MOT
is turned oﬀ, and the atoms are further cooled in a blue
optical molasses [19] by detuning the laser ﬁeld to +2ΓCs
with respect to the 62S1/2(F = 4) - 62P3/2(F = 4) tran-
sition for 20 ms.

The CO2 laser beam is present during the whole load-
ing phase. Since the static polarizability of the 62P3/2
state in cesium is larger than the polarizability of the
ground state by around a factor of 4, the atomic res-
onance frequency of the cesium D2 line is inhomoge-
10ΓCs.
neously shifted with a maximum value of roughly
However, the number of atoms in the MOT is found to
be independent of whether the CO2 is turned on or oﬀ.
After the cooling laser beams have been turned oﬀ,
up to 106 atoms remain trapped in the focus of the CO2
laser beam at a temperature of 30 µK and a peak density
close to 1012 atoms/cm3. Atoms are prepared in either
the F = 3 or the F = 4 hyperﬁne ground state by shut-
tering the cooling laser 1 ms after or before the repump-
ing laser has been shuttered, respectively. To detect the
optically trapped atoms, we either recapture the atoms
in the MOT and measure the intensity of the ﬂuorescence
light, or we analyze the spatially resolved absorption of a

level. The decay of the number of stored cesium atoms
is shown in Fig. 3(a) from which one infers a 1/e storage
time of 150 s. The very long storage time is purely lim-
ited by collisions with hot atoms out of the background

chamber [22]. Laser-noise induced loss mechanisms [21]
can apparently be completely neglected. Since Cs has a
large scattering length the Cs gas thermalizes on a time
scale of < 0.1 s. In contrast to previous experiments in
a shallower trap [22], spontaneous evaporation of atoms
is exponentially suppressed by a factor η
ǫt/kBT of
more than 20. Experimentally, we indeed observe nei-
ther loss of Cs atoms nor reduction of the temperature
due to evaporation.

To determine the characteristic frequencies of the
trap, we induce axial and radial oscillations of the cloud
of trapped atoms. Radial oscillations are excited by a
release-recapture cycle in the optical trap. First, the
laser is turned oﬀ (switch-oﬀ time < 100 µs) which leads
to a ballistic expansion of the atomic cloud. After
∼
0.5 ms, the cloud has expanded to about twice its initial
radial width. Then, the CO2 laser is turned on again
and almost all atoms are recaptured by the dipole trap.
Through this process, the atoms have gained potential
energy, which is subsequently converted into kinetic en-
ergy. Thus, the radial size of the atom cloud starts to
oscillate at twice the radial oscillation frequency. Since
we can not fully resolve the radial extension of the atom
cloud with our absorption imaging system, we measure

weak resonant probe beam passing through the trapped
atoms (absorption imaging [20]). The latter method al-
lows one to absolutely calibrate the atom number. In
Fig. 2, the absorption image of the trapped Cs atoms
shows the expected elongated shape with an aspect ra-
tio of ωax/ωrad
44. Note, that the radial extension of
the atomic cloud is not resolved by our camera system.
The evolution of the number of atoms in the dipole
trap is measured by recapturing the atoms back into the
MOT after a variable storage time. The number of atoms
is determined from a charge coupled device camera pic-
ture by integrating over the ﬂuorescence image, while
subtracting a background image. We expect the parti-
cle number determined by this method to be accurate
within a factor of two. Fluctuations in the loading ﬂux
are cancelled by loading the MOT up to a certain density
(determined by the ﬂuorescence signal) rather than for
a ﬁxed period of time: A photodiode records the ﬂuores-
cence of the atoms in the MOT and triggers the transfer

the corresponding oscillation in the kinetic energy. For
this purpose, the CO2 laser is turned oﬀ again after
a variable delay relative to the release-recapture cycle,
and the radial extension is determined through absorp-
tion imaging after 1.2 ms of ballistic expansion. Fig. 4(a)
shows the oscillation of the root mean square velocity at
a frequency of 1.6 kHz. The corresponding oscillation fre-
quency of the trapped atoms of 0.8 kHz is in reasonable
agreement with the expected radial oscillation frequency
for a focused beam with a waist of 85 µm.

Axial oscillations can easily be excited by loading at
an axial position oﬀ the focus. For this purpose, the rela-
tive position of the MOT is shifted along the propagation
direction of the CO2-laser beam. After transfer into the
QUEST, the cesium cloud starts to perform a damped
oscillation at a frequency of 18 Hz as depicted in the up-
per graph of Fig. 4. The damping of the oscillation is
caused by the anharmonicity of the conﬁning potential.

Assuming a pure Gaussian beam, one would expect an
oscillation frequency about twice as large as the actual
measured value. We explain the discrepancy by aberra-
tions in the optical system. Table 3.1 summarizes the
relevant trap parameters for lithium and cesium.

In the ﬁrst few seconds after the CO2 laser has been
turned on, we observe a small drift of the axial position
of the laser focus, which can be attributed to thermal
eﬀects in the laser cavity and optics. To eliminate this
drift of the focal position, we leave the CO2 laser perma-
nently on while loading the MOT and transferring the
atoms.

3.2 Lithium

3.3 Combined transfer

For cesium the thermal energy of the atoms in the MOT
is much smaller than the depth of the QUEST which re-
sults in a rather large transfer eﬃciency. The situation
is diﬀerent for lithium. Due to the large recoil of pho-
tons on lithium atoms, the thermal energies in a lithium
MOT are comparable or even larger than the depth of
the dipole trap resulting in a poor phase-space overlap
and thus a small transfer eﬃciency.

The lithium MOT is also loaded from a Zeeman-
slowed atomic beam. Details of the MOT system are de-
scribed in Ref. [23]. The largest numbers of Li atoms are
accumulated at relatively large detunings of the MOT
lasers acting on the two hyperﬁne components of the Li
D2 line. After loading typically 107 atoms into the MOT,
the atomic cloud is compressed for 4 ms by switching
the detunings closer to resonance (
1 ΓLi with ΓLi/2π =
5.9 MHz). Due to the unresolved hyperﬁne structure of
the excited state, sub-Doppler cooling mechanisms are
ineﬃcient for lithium and temperature is essentially de-
termined by the limit for Doppler cooling (140 µK at low
saturation). To attain a temperature close to that limit,
the MOT magnetic ﬁeld is turned oﬀ and the MOT lasers
are attenuated to 20% of their full power which leads to
a ﬁnal temperature of 350 µK and a cloud size of 800 µm
after typically 1 ms. In contrast to cesium, the light shift
of the CO2 laser beam on the D2 resonance line is neg-
ligible since the static polarizability of the ground and
excited state diﬀer by only 25%.

−

After all MOT laser beams have been shut oﬀ, about
0.5% of the Li atoms are captured by the QUEST with
1010 atoms/cm3. Thermalization of
a peak density of
these atoms is extremely slow: estimated collision times
based on the s-wave scattering lengths for Li are exceed-
ing 100 seconds. On the time scales of the experiments
discussed in the following, lithium can therefore not be
assumed to be in thermal equilibrium.

∼

Due to the small optical density of the sample, we
were so far not able to directly measure the distribution
of lithium atoms in the trap by absorption imaging tech-
niques. Instead, we have performed a Monte-Carlo simu-
lation of the transfer process which provides us with the
spatial and energy distributions. The energy distribu-
tion is highly non-thermal with most atoms populating
high lying energy states in the potential because of the
large initial thermal energy relative to the trap depth.
The small rate for elastic collisions inhibits evaporation
of these loosely bound atoms. The measurement of the
number of trapped lithium atoms as a function of stor-
age time depicted in Fig. 3 thus shows a pure exponential
decay with a time constant of 125 s with no indication
for evaporation of particles from the trap. On the ba-
sis of the above estimate for the thermalization times,
we assume the energy distribution hardly changes with
time.

To load a mixture of lithium and cesium, one could
start from a two-species MOT [14], but in this case the
numbers of atoms and the densities are severely lim-
ited by light-assisted inelastic collisions between the two
species. However, our measurements with a 2-species
MOT showed that collisions involving optically excited
Li (Li∗) and ground-state Cs are strongly suppressed by
optical shielding through the repulsive van-der-Waals in-
teraction in the Li∗-Cs manifold [14]. It is therefore fa-
vorable to ﬁrst optically cool and transfer Cs into the
QUEST, and then load the Li MOT. A typical loading
time of the Li MOT is 4 s. In order to exclude any loss
processes by inelastic collisions, we spatially separate the
Li MOT from the optically trapped Cs sample with a
small bias magnetic ﬁeld (3 G) shifting the centre of the
Li MOT by about 2 mm. In this way, we observe no loss
of Li and only a 50 % loss of Cs in the combined transfer,
as compared to the separate trapping of only one species.
A detailed investigation of the combined transfer will be
published elsewhere.

4 Spin-changing lithium-cesium collisions

Two atoms approaching each other in their electronic
ground state may either collide elastically with the to-
tal energy being conserved, as will be discussed in the
next Section, or they may undergo an exoergic collision
transforming internal energy into kinetic energy of the
collision partners. The latter process leads to trap loss
if the kinetic energy release is larger than the escape en-
ergy of the trap. Optical dipole traps are perfectly suited
to study inelastic processes among trapped atoms since
the optical trapping force is conservative with a well-
deﬁned potential, the investigation may be performed in
zero magnetic ﬁeld or in a controlled homogeneous ﬁeld,
and the atoms can be prepared in any internal state by
appropriate optical pumping methods. Up to now, no
experiment on ultracold inelastic collisions between two
diﬀerent atomic species in the electronic ground state
has reported.

For ground-state Li and Cs atoms in an optical dipole
trap, the essential inelastic processes are collisions that
change the hyperﬁne quantum numbers F and mF . The
spin-changing collision process between lithium and ce-
sium can be written symbolically as

Li(F = 1) + Cs(F = 4)

LiCs(1Σg or 3Σu)
Li(F = 1) + Cs(F = 3) + ∆ǫkin .

The potential curves for the singlet and triplet ground
states of the Li-Cs pair are schematically depicted in
Fig. 5. Spin-changing collisions exiting at a lower en-
ergetic asymptote than the entrance channel lead to a
transformation of the internal energy into kinetic energy
∆ǫkin of the collision partners, and consequently to loss

from the trap. Although lithium takes the major share
of the kinetic energy gain, both atoms escape from the
QUEST due to the small trap depth as compared to the
hyperﬁne energy.

Inelastic collisions of trapped ground-state atoms have
been extensively studied theoretically and experimen-
tally since the early days of magnetic traps [24]. Hyperﬁne-
changing collisions represent the major limitation on achiev-
able densities and/or storage times in magnetic traps.
These collisions in magnetic traps are almost unavoid-
able, since atoms can not be trapped in the lowest ener-
getic state. In particular, spin-changing collisions impede
sympathetic cooling between diﬀerent atomic species in
magnetic traps.

Exoergic ground-state collisions also turned out to be
an important loss mechanism in shallow light-pressure
traps. They were observed and analyzed for homonu-
clear collisions [25], as well as for mixtures of diﬀerent
elements [12,13,14]. However, as has been pointed out
recently [15], the presence of near-resonant light strongly
modiﬁes the dynamics of the collision process which can
lead to a dramatic change in the measured rate coeﬃ-
cients. Therefore, care should be taken to interpret trap
loss and the corresponding rate coeﬃcients in shallow
light-pressure traps as an indication of pure ground-
state collisions. In a purely conservative trap such as the
QUEST the situation is much better deﬁned since the
trapping light has negligible inﬂuence on the collision
process.

To qualitatively investigate whether hyperﬁne-changing

collisions between Li and Cs can be observed with the
particle numbers and densities available in our QUEST,
we have pumped one of the species into the upper hyper-
ﬁne ground state and recorded the eﬀect on the storage
time of the other species, which was prepared in the
lower hyperﬁne state. The result of these experiments is
depicted in Fig. 6. From the timescale of the graph it
immediately becomes apparent, that the presence of a
hyperﬁne-excited atomic gas reduces the storage time of

order of magnitude as compared to the rest-gas limited
lifetimes (see Fig. 3).

In Fig. 6(a), we show data for a combination of Li in
the upper hyperﬁne state [Li 22S1/2(FLi↓=2)], with Cs
in the lower hyperﬁne ground state [Cs 62S1/2(FCs↑=
3)]. Without the presence of Cs, the Li slowly decays
through exoergic Li-Li collisions. The eﬀect of collision
with restgas atoms can be neglected on this timescale.
In presence of Cs, the Li decay is much faster. Spin-
exchange between Li and Cs atoms is the dominant pro-
cess for these interspecies collisions. An enhanced Li-Li
inelastic collision rate due to an increased Li density af-
ter thermalization with the Cs may also play a minor
role, but this would lead to a non-exponential decay of
the Li, while we observe an exponential decay with a

time constant of 1.7 s. The eﬀect of spin-changing Li-Cs
collisions on the Cs is not observable as the Cs atoms
outnumber the Li atoms. As the lithium distribution is
not known, and may even be nonconstant due to elas-
tic collisions happening simultaneously, we can currently
only estimate the order of magnitude of the inelastic rate
10−10 cm3/s. We are currently im-
constant βCs↓Li↑
plementing an improved absorption imaging system for
Li in our apparatus, which will allow us to measure the
density distribution of the Li atoms und thus allow for

Cs itself decays due to exoergic Cs-Cs collisions. The Li,
however, is lost on a much shorter timescale of 2 s. Due
to the unknown Li distribution, we can only oﬀer an
estimate of the rate constant of the exoergic collisions
10−10 cm3/s. As one might expect, both

5 Sympathetic cooling with slow sympathetic
evaporation

In case both atomic gases are in the lower hyperﬁne
states [Li 22S1/2(FLi↓=1) and Cs 62S1/2(FCs↓=3)], only
elastic collisions are possible. These collisions lead to en-
ergy transfer between the distributions, which in turn
leads to two diﬀerent phenomena: The most obvious
one is the equalization of the temperatures of the two
gases, which is referred to as sympathetic cooling. A sec-
ond phenomenon is the evaporative loss of one or both
species through collisions with the other species, which
we call sympathetic evaporation.

5.1 Sympathetic cooling

For the case where all relevant temperatures are well
below the trap depth, the dynamics are relatively sim-
ple: No atoms evaporate and the temperatures of the two
components approach each other. A quantum-mechanical
treatment of sympathetic cooling has been given in Refs. [26,
27]. For the Boltzmann regime, an analytical formula for
the evolution of the temperatures in a mixture of equal
mass atoms was derived in Ref. [16]. In the same paper,
the approach is extended towards atoms with diﬀerent
mass, however, the dependence of the cooling eﬃciency
on the mass ratio is derived under the assumption of
equal trap frequencies. This assumption corresponds to
an implicit mass dependence of the trap potential, which
is not present for realistic traps, and which leads to a
strongly overestimated reduction of the cooling eﬃciency
at large mass ratio. Below, we adapt the approach of
Ref. [16] by assuming an explicit trap potential, so that
our results remain valid for large mass ratios. The aver-
age energy transfer per collision can be calculated from

simple kinematics,

∆E1→2 = ξkB(T1

The energy transfer is reduced by a factor ξ with re-
spect to collisions between atoms with equal mass. For
equal mass atoms in a harmonic trap, approximately 3
collisions are needed for thermalization (see [16] and ref-
erences therein), as the heat capacity per atom is 3kB.
For 133Cs and 7Li, we need 3/ξ
15 collisions to ther-
malize.

For equal masses and trap frequencies we reproduce the

For the initial conditions of our experiment we obtain
an approximate initial cooling time constant, where we
neglect the inﬂuence of the Cs temperature since Cs is
much colder, heavier and more tightly conﬁned than the
Li.

The eﬀect of the mass diﬀerence on the thermalization
time is a factor ξ−1/2

large mass diﬀerence, the thermalization eﬃciency per
collision is reduced by a factor ξ, but the collision fre-
quency depends on ¯v, which is proportional to ξ−1/2.

5.2 Sympathetic evaporation

Under the circumstances in our experiment, we expect
evaporation of the Li atoms especially during the ﬁrst
few collision times, as the initial Li energy distribution
has a width comparable to the trap depth. Once the
gases are thermalized, Li evaporation is exponentially
suppressed, but still may occur due to the high Li-Cs
collision rate. Cs evaporation is always strongly sup-
pressed as the Cs trap depth is much larger than the
relevant temperatures. We can approximately describe
the regime of slow evaporation by assuming a truncated
Boltzmann distribution [28] for the Li atoms. The num-
ber of evaporation events per second is the number of
collisions multiplied by the probability that a collision
leads to evaporation. For simplicity, we will neglect the
position dependence of this probability. The evaporation
ﬂux in a two-component sample with a large mass ratio
can be estimated from a detailed balance approach: The
number of evaporation events is equal to the number of
“atom capture” events that happen if the gas were in
complete equilibrium with a distribution that extends
above the trap edge ǫt. The latter number can be esti-
mated for η
1. We assume the dominant
process is the one where a Li atom with an energy just
above ǫt collides with a thermal Cs atom. The thermal
motion of the Cs atom can be neglected if η is suﬃciently
large, and on average a fraction ξ/2 of the energy of the
Li atom is transferred to the Cs atom. This leads to an
estimate for the evaporation probability per collision of

the last collision only loses a small amount of energy,
of order ηξkBT . The Li distribution on the other hand
loses a particle and an energy of
ηkBT , leading to a
decrease of the mean energy per Li atom of

Here ¯e = (NCseCs+NLieLi)/(NCs+NLi). The evaporation-
induced energy diﬀerence is of the same order of mag-
nitude as the diﬀerence in mean energy between a trun-
cated Boltzmann distribution and the full thermal dis-
tribution described by the same temperature [28].

The initial phase of thermalization, in which the distri-
butions are strongly non-thermal, is diﬃcult to describe
in an analytical model. To obtain understanding of all
phases of the thermalization process we made a numer-
ical simulation of Li-Cs thermalization in a ﬁnite depth
“box” potential well. We assume that due to the large
scattering length the Cs distribution remains thermal at
all times, while we numerically integrate the Boltzmann
equation for the Li distribution. In Fig. 7 we show the
evolution of the mean energies and particle numbers,
where a broad initial distribution for the Li atoms was
chosen. The evolution of the distributions is shown in
Fig. 8.

In the initial phase of the thermalization process, the
ﬁrst
5 collisions in Fig. 7, the Li has an internal en-
ergy per particle comparable to the trap depth, so that

evaporation is very fast. After this rapid evaporation, a
thermalization phase sets in (5 to 50 collisions) in which
the mean energies rapidly converge. Finally, after 50 col-
lisions a quasi-stationary phase with slow sympathetic
evaporation and only slowly varying, almost equal tem-
peratures sets in. We observe that although we start with
50 collisions the evaporating Li gas

has a lower average energy per particle than the Cs, rea-
sonably well described by Eq.(10).

5.4 Comparison with measurements

A complete characterization of the thermalization pro-
cess requires measurement of all relevant thermodynamic
variables: the Li and Cs temperatures and particle num-
bers. Unfortunately, presently the Li temperature cannot
be measured, and as NCs
NLi, the eﬀect of sympa-
≫
thetic cooling on the Cs temperature is too small to be
measured accurately.

The evolution of the number of Li atoms in the trap
is shown in Fig. 9. When stored separately, both Li and
Cs gases decay due to rest gas collisions in 125 and 150
s respectively. There is no indication of evaporation in
either case: Cs does not evaporate as its temperature is
far below the trap depth. Li evaporation is energetically
possible but the cross section for Li-Li collisions is so
small that the characteristic timescale is > 1000 s.

When the gases are stored simultaneously, the Li
atom number shows a non-exponential initial behavior
followed by an approximately exponential decay with a

characteristic time of 35 s, which is much faster than the
125 s rest gas induced decay. We interpret the initial loss
as due to evaporation in the ﬁrst few Li-Cs collisions (cf.
Fig. 7), and the slow decay as due to sympathetic evap-
oration after thermalization. Equation (8) now allows us
to estimate the collision frequency. From the calculated
Li trap depth and the measured Cs temperature after 20
10−3. This leads
s, TCs = 44(5) µK we ﬁnd Pevap
14 s−1,
to an estimated collision rate per Li atom of

section

From the collision rate we infer a cross-species ther-
malization time of approximately 1 s, which is much
shorter than the rest gas limited storage times in our
trap. Therefore, we conclude that sympathetic cooling
of Li by Cs is a viable method to produce ultracold Li
gas.

6 Conclusion

In conclusion, we have simultaneously stored ultracold
lithium and cesium atoms in a conservative optical dipole
trap. Exoergic spin-changing collisions lead to trap loss
on a time scale of a few seconds at densities of 1010
atoms/cm3 and 1012 atoms/cm3 for lithium and cesium,
respectively. Under conditions where exoergic collisions
are impossible, a slow loss of Li atoms is observed, which
we attribute to sympathetic evaporation through elastic
Li-Cs collisions. The interpretation in terms of a model
for sympathetic cooling and evaporation provides an es-
timated cross-thermalization time of one second.

The interpretation of the observations in terms of
sympathetic cooling should be conﬁrmed by measure-
ments of the temperature evolution and phase space
density. Such measurements are currently in prepara-
tion. Temperature data will also enable us to measure
the elastic cross section σCsLi for cold, elastic Li-Cs col-
lisions more accurately. Optimization of the Cs cooling
process is certainly possible and will lead to lower ﬁnal
temperatures of the Li gas.

Repeated pulsed optical cooling of the Cs may be
useful to remove thermal energy from the system with-
out loss of atoms. This method oﬀers a possible route
towards quantum degeneracy of Li without evaporation.
The de Broglie wavelength of Li is larger than that of
Cs at the same temperature by a factor of 4.4, which
makes it possible to achieve quantum degeneracy with
either the fermionic or the bosonic Li isotopes in ther-
mal contact with optically cooled Cs. For 106 Li atoms
in our trap we ﬁnd a degeneracy temperature Tdeg
≃
¯h(ωxωyωz NLi)1/3/kB = 3 µK, well within the range of
standard optical cooling techniques for Cs. But even at
the temperatures we reach presently, sympathetic cool-
ing signiﬁcantly increases the Li density in the centre
of the trap. This is an essential step towards creation

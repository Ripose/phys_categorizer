We report on progress towards a measurement of the ﬁne structure constant α to an accuracy
of 5 × 10−10 or better by measuring the ratio h/mCs of the Planck constant h to the mass of the
cesium atom mCs. Compared to similar experiments, ours is improved in three signiﬁcant ways: (i)
simultaneous conjugate interferometers, (ii) multi-photon Bragg diﬀraction between same internal
states, and (iii) an about 1000 fold reduction of laser phase noise to -138 dBc/Hz. Combining that
with a new method to simultaneously stabilize the phases of four frequencies, we achieve 0.2 mrad
eﬀective phase noise at the location of the atoms. In addition, we use active stabilization to suppress
systematic eﬀects due to beam misalignment.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁne structure constant α [1] describes the strength
of the electromagnetic interaction and is thus important
in all of physics, from elementary particle, nuclear and
atomic physics to mesoscopic and macroscopic systems;
an improved measurement will thus be a basis for many
applications in both fundamental and applied science.
This also implies that α can be measured by a wide va-
riety of precision experiments, see Table I [2]. This also
provides one of the best measures of the overall consis-
tency of our basic theories and experimental methods.
Measurements of α have been made using, for example,
the quantum Hall eﬀect, the ac Josephson eﬀect, or neu-
tron interferometry. (The latter value also depends on
the electron and neutron masses and crystal lattice spac-
It is unclear whether the uncertainties of these
ings.)

methods can dramatically be reduced in the near future.
The best precision measurements of α to date, how-
ever, are based on the following two diﬀerent principles:
From a measurement of the electron’s anomalous mag-
2, α can be calculated using quan-
netic moment ge −
tum electrodynamics. This calculation [13] is probably
the most accurate prediction in science (that is not just
a simple combination of integers or mathematical con-
stants such as e and π).
It includes electron terms as
well as contributions from the muon, the tauon, hadrons,
and even the weak interaction, see Fig. 1. At the cur-
rent experimental accuracy, however, only the electron
terms (up to the 4th order) are relevant. From the best
2, α is obtained to a precision of
current data on ge −
3.8 ppb. On the other hand, α can be obtained from
measurements of h/m, the ratio of the Planck constant
to the mass of an atom. The two best experiments both
lead to a similar accuracy of about 7 ppb in α: Biraben
and co-workers [5] used Rubidium atoms and Wicht et al.
(the predecessor of the experiment described here)[6, 14]
Cesium. The accuracy of the latter result may improve
by up to a factor of two when an accurate theoretical
estimate of the largest systematic eﬀect has been made,
the index of refraction of Cs atoms. This method does
not rely on involved QED calculations. Thus, on the
one hand, it is not limited by the accuracy of present
QED theory. On the other hand, a comparison to α as
2 amounts to a test of QED. The
obtained from ge −
present values of α, obtained from both g
2 and h/m
experiments, agree within the overall experimental error
of about 8 ppb. This corresponds to one of our best tests
of QED and is an impressive accomplishment of modern
physics.

Recently, Gabrielse et al. have repeated the ge−

surement and anticipate a precision in α of

accuracy to which QED is experimentally tested by more
than a factor of ten by an improved measurement of

trate on the role and the interaction of the secondary

light on its way from the lasers to the atoms and thus
reduce the noise as seen by the atoms. We believe that
these technical aspects are interesting in the context of
present and future atom interferometry projects (such as
spaceborne experiments).

(1.7 ppb) shown in Fig. 1 would become visible. Thus,
we are not only looking for the tenth digit of α, but also
for the ﬁrst digit of these eﬀects. Many new discoveries in
physics have come out of experiments that have pushed
the boundaries of applicability of our physical theories.

A preliminary measurement of the anomaly gµ −
the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon to 1 ppm (part per
million) at the Brookhaven laboratory [16, 17] makes this
particularly exciting: Data obtained over ﬁve years devi-
ate from the QED prediction by 0.9-2.4 standard devia-
tions (equivalent to 0.5-1.2 ppm); the exact deviation de-
pends on the method employed to estimate the hadronic
vacuum polarization.
If other explanations would fail,
however, the discrepancy could be a ﬁrst indication for
supersymmetric particles. Our experiment with its sub-
ppb accuracy will allow to resolve the hadronic inﬂuence
for the electron and can thus contribute to a clariﬁcation
of these issues.

Outline of the paper

This paper describes how we want to reach the above
accuracy of 0.5 ppb (or better) in α. Since the phase of
the atomic wave function is measured against the phase
of laser beams, the accuracy is based on a laser system
of high phase stability. While many other systematic ef-
fects also need to be taken into account, in this paper we
focus on the construction of the laser system. Section II
describes the basic principle of the measurement of h/m;
the atom interferometric realization is then described in
Sec. III. The main part of the paper, Sec. IV, describes
the feedback loops that we use to obtain a drastic re-
duction of laser phase noise, the most important noise

The principle of our experiment is to measure the recoil

frequency

fr =

hf 2
2mc2

of an atom with the mass m that absorbs or emits a
photon having the frequency f , where h is the Planck
constant and c the velocity of light: If an atom absorbs
a photon, it also absorbs the photon momentum p =
hf /c and thus acquires a kinetic energy of p2/(2m) =
h2f 2/(2mc2). Thus, transitions between the ground and
the excited states can take place if the light frequency is

f = feg ±

fr ,

where hfeg is the energy of the excited state of the atom
relative to the ground state in the rest frame of the
atom. The positive sign yields absorption, the negative
stimulated emission. In our experiment, we use the D2
transition in cesium atoms, so m = mCs is the mass
of the cesium atom and f
352 THz. Thus,

would measure the diﬀerence in the frequencies of light
that produce stimulated emission and absorption in Cs
atoms.

we can express α by the recoil frequency, the Rydberg

veriﬁed by inserting the deﬁnitions R∞ = mee4/(8cǫ2
0h3)
and α = e2/(4πǫ0~c). The quantities entering this re-
lation are known to high accuracy from frequency mea-
surements (hydrogen spectroscopy for R∞ and measur-
ing the ratio of cyclotron frequencies in Penning traps for
the mass ratios), see Tab. II. The uncertainties in these
quantities have been improved recently by new measure-
ments of me/mu and the Cs transition frequency and
combine to 0.24 ppb in α [note that most uncertainties
enter α with half their value due to Eq. (3)]. However,
for both the mass ratios as well as the Rydberg constant,
there is a clear potential for signiﬁcant improvements in
the near future. But already with the present uncer-
tainties, we can obtain α to an accuracy of up to about
0.3 ppb.

III. ATOM INTERFEROMETRY FOR
MEASURING h/m

A. Previous experiment at Stanford

The measurement of h/m is extremely challenging:
The recoil frequency shift of about 2 kHz out of fD2 ≃
352 THz is minuscule — it is even small compared to
the natural linewidth Γ
5 MHz of the transition.
2π
Therefore, several reﬁnements were introduced in the pre-
vious experiment:

×

∼

•

•

Two-photon transitions between two hyperﬁne
ground states are made. The two ground states
are long-lived and thus their linewidth is no longer
limited by the lifetime of the excited state. Be-
sides, the two photon momenta increase the recoil
8 kHz, as the eﬀective wavevector
shift to 4fr ∼

wavevectors k1,2 of the counterpropagating beams.

Atom interferometry [see Fig. 2] can dramatically
improve the resolution. The beam splitters are
formed by π/2 laser pulses that transfer the atoms
g, p0i
(where g, e denote the ground
from a state
|
and excited states and p0 the initial external mo-
mentum) to a state
with 50%
probability. By interfering two atomic paths that
have experienced the recoil ~keﬀ at diﬀerent times
separated by T , one obtains interference fringes
with a width of 1/T . The atom source is an atomic
fountain in which atoms cooled to near the re-
coil temperature Trec (200 nK for cesium) [20] are
launched and are under free-fall conditions for up
to about 1 s. Fringe widths of 4 Hz are practical, an
improvement of 6 orders of magnitude compared to
the basic experiment (in which the linewidth is ei-
ther limited by the natural linewidth of 5 MHz or
even the Doppler linewidth of the thermal atoms of

300 MHz).

•

∼
We compare the measurements of two “conjugate”
interferometers, i.e., ones where the recoil points
vertically upwards and downwards, see Fig.
3.
Therefore, the signal is doubled while the fringe
shift due to gravity cancels out (as do numerous
other systematic eﬀects).

•

By inserting up to N = 30 additional excitations
into the interferometer paths, we increase the recoil
to 4fr(N + 1).

This describes the ﬁnal stage of that experiment, which
was improved several times. For simplicity, we left out
several details like the use of adiabatic transfer to perform
the beam splitters and π-pulses, that will be found in the
literature [6, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24].

B. New experiment

In this section, we will describes the major improve-
ments that are made in the new experiment to achieve
better accuracy:

•

•

(SCIs):
Simultaneous conjugate interferometers
The use of adiabatic transfer for the beam split-
ters (as well as the technical diﬃculty of addressing
interferometers simultaneously, that we will deal
with in this paper) made it necessary to run the
two conjugate interferometers subsequently. This
means, however, that time-dependent disturbances
such as vibrations do not cancel between the inter-
ferometers. Using SCIs, however, (Fig. 3) we can
achieve cancellation for both time-independent and
-dependent errors. Obviously, however, if the vibra-
tions enter the phase relationship between the laser
beams used in the SCIs, this method is of little use.
The major challenge thus is to generate these four
laser beams with an accurate phase relationship.

Multi-photon transitions between same (F = 3
or F = 4, mF = 0) internal states: We re-
place the transitions between hyperﬁne states by
multi- (n-) photon transitions (“Bragg diﬀraction”)

momentum states, but within a single internal state
of the atom (Fig. 4). This strongly reduces the in-
ﬂuence of magnetic and electric ﬁelds, since the in-
ternal state is never changed: Thus, the sensitivity
to external ﬁelds is now the same in all interfer-
ometer paths and thus cancels. n
photon tran-
sitions also increase the momentum transferred to
the atoms. The phase of the atomic wave function
Ψ is proportional to the momentum squared, and
thus to n2. The signal to noise ratio can thus be

been demonstrated in atomic beam interferometers
[25, 26]. Beam devices, however, have shorter inter-
action times and lower signal to noise ratio than the
atomic fountain interferometers used for precision
measurements.

•

Strong laser noise reduction: The most severe lim-
itation of the previous experiment was laser phase
noise, arising, for example, from imperfections of
the laser phase stabilization, mechanical vibrations
of optics and ﬁbers, and air currents. It took about
a week of integration time to obtain the ﬁnal reso-
lution of a few ppb. Experience has shown that the
resolution obtained in a few days corresponds to the
accuracy possible in one year, since the experiment
has to be repeated many times in order to check for
systematic eﬀects. Therefore, we reduce the laser
noise about 1000 fold to hopefully achieve a ppb
level resolution in minutes rather than weeks. This
reduction is achieved by an extremely tight phase-
lock, common-mode rejection between the conju-
gate interferometers, and secondary phase stabi-
lization loops that measure the phase near the lo-
cation of the atoms. More details on this will be
found in Sec. IV.

C. Phase of the SCIs

The phase of the SCIs shown in Fig. 3 is given as
follows: We use the usual Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin
method. There are four π/2 pulses for each atom
group. The Hamiltonians describing the interactions of
the atoms with these laser pulses are proportional to

FIG. 4: Bragg diﬀraction: A Raman transition (left) trans-
fers the atom into another ground state. In Bragg diﬀraction,
a n−photon transition between the ground state and the same
ground state is performed. However, this applies n times the
recoil momentum ~k to the external motion of the atom and
thus transfers it into a momentum energy level at n2 times
the recoil energy, transferring the atom to a higher level of
(external) kinetic energy.

exp(inφ1−4/2), where φ1−4 are the phases of the pulses.
The factor of n/2 arises because an n
photon transition
corresponds to an n/2th order Bragg diﬀraction. Thus,
the transition amplitudes are proportional to the inter-
action to the power of n/2. We add an accent to denote
the phases for the second interferometer. The phases of
the two interferometers are denoted Φ1,2. We obtain

INTERFEROMETER LASER SYSTEM AND

NOISE REDUCTION

At the heart of the experiment is a laser system gener-
ating the light pulses for the beam splitters in the inter-
ferometer. The accuracy that we aim for requires a phase
noise much lower than demonstrated in previous exper-
iments; and the SCIs require four simultaneous, phase
locked frequencies. The system has to supply these fre-
quencies in Gaussian pulses of the appropriate length for
obtaining π/2 and π pulses.

A. Requirements

To simultaneously address the two interferometers,
four laser frequencies f1−4 are needed, which have to
satisfy resonance conditions in the frame of the falling
atoms. Technically, the phase φ is given by phases of
four simultaneous laser beams. The ﬁrst interferometer
will be addressed by the frequencies f1 and f4. The sec-
ond interferometer is addressed by f2 and f3. Thus, we

where T
for example, with N = 10, n = 10, and T=0.2 s, would
give an error of 36 ppb in h/m.
If this is reached for
one individual launch (every two seconds), it would be

5

1 ppb in h/mCs and 0.5 ppb in α within a few hours of
integration.

The frequency f0, on the other hand, drops out of the
ﬁnal result. However, a large noise in f0 would make
it impossible to measure interference fringes within the
individual interferometers. By a simultaneous analysis
of the combined data using an ellipse ﬁt [27], it is still
possible to measure the diﬀerential signal. However, for
diﬀerent applications and as a tool for characterizing sys-
tematic eﬀects, one wants to have fringes from the indi-
vidual interferometers. Therefore, we need a good phase
noise performance in f0 as well.

B. Basic setup

∼

Two frequencies are generated from two Coherent 899
Ti:sapphire lasers that will be denoted red and black
in this paper (Fig. 5). Compared to diode lasers [28],
Ti:sapphire lasers provide higher output power, which
is important for high-order Bragg diﬀraction with high
1.4 W output power) is
eﬃciency. The black laser (
pumped by a Coherent Verdi-10. The red laser (
1.6 W)
contains an intra-cavity electro-optic modulator (EOM)
for phase locking. Because of the losses associated with
the insertion of the EOM it needs a higher pump power,
which is provided by a Coherent Innova argon-ion laser
that is running at 15.6 W output power. (Without the
EOM, the power of the red laser can be 2.0 W at this
pump power.) The light of both lasers is brought into
the setup by two single-mode ﬁbers (not shown), to de-
couple the alignment of the setup and the one of the
lasers. The ﬁbers provide about 1.0 and 1.2 W at their
outputs.

∼

→

The frequency of the black laser is stabilized to a
frequency which is 10 GHz higher than the one of the
F = 5 D2 manifold. This is done by phase-
F = 3
locking it at 10 GHz oﬀset (given by a microwave synthe-
sizer) to a diode laser that is itself frequency stabilized
to a resonance in a cesium vapor cell.
The frequency diﬀerence fred −

is phase locked to a variable frequency around 168 MHz
(Fig. 6) by the “primary” phase lock as described in
Ref.
It uses the intracavity EOM as a feedback
path with 10 MHz closed-loop bandwidth, achieved using
broadband radio-frequency ampliﬁers to drive the EOM
and a passive network to set the frequency response. The
speed is actually limited by the delay due to the
5 m
signal path between the EOM and the detector.

We achieve a phase-noise of -138 dBc/Hz (i.e., the noise
power spectral density expressed in dB within one Hz
bandwidth, referred to the carrier) measured 1 MHz from
the carrier (Fig.

phase noise achieved in any phase locked laser system.
The phase noise was measured by taking a beat note be-
tween the lasers using a separate photodetector with a
HP 8590B spectrum analyzer. The low frequency part

for details. However, even the best phase-lock does not
guarantee that the light as seen by the atoms has low (or
even acceptable) noise, because the transmission of light
through ﬁbers [30], the vibration of optical elements, and
even the ﬂuctuating index of refraction of air due to air
currents seriously degrade the phase stability. Therefore,
we use an elaborate system of feedback loops to cancel
the phase noise as seen by the atoms. In this paper, we
will concentrate on these extra feedback loops and their
interrelation.

Although it has been pointed out in the literature (e.g.,
[28]), we note here that there are many common mistakes
in frequency and phase-noise measurements. The most
common one is to infer the noise from the error signal in a
closed phase or frequency locked loop (“in-loop measure-
ment”). There is no certainty that all noise components
are revealed in such a signal. For example, if the beam
splitter in the beat setup of the primary phase lock (Fig.
5) vibrates, this causes the phase of the beat to be un-
stable. However, this instability is removed by the lock,
with the result that its negative image now appears in the
red laser light. For this and other reasons (such as imper-
fections of the phase detector), the in-loop measurement
often underestimates the real noise, by as much as 40 dB
in some cases. A conservative method to measure phase
noise is to overlap the beams on another beamsplitter
elsewhere in the setup and use a separate beat detector
(“out-of-loop signal”). All phase noises quoted in this

work have been measured using this method.

The beams of the red and the black lasers are over-
lapped on an acousto-optic modulator (AOM1, Fig. 5)
168 MHz at 50%
that is running at a frequency fI ≃
deﬂection eﬃciency. Two pairs of beams are thus ob-
tained, each consisting of an un-deﬂected beam from one
laser and a deﬂected and frequency shifted beam from the
other laser. Each of them has a power of about 500 mW.
The frequencies of them are

(Fig. 6). Within each pair, the frequency diﬀerence is
fI. This will be the reference for measuring
thus ∆
the recoil shift. Each pair then gets frequency shifted by
the double-pass AOMs 2 and 3 by fIII. After that, the
frequencies are

t2/(2σ2)] with a σ of the order of 20 µs. The AOMs
exp[
need to be located before the ﬁbers (Fig. 5). Located af-
ter the ﬁbers, they could impair the pointing stability and
the shape of the beams that address the atoms. Pointing
stability and a high quality of the spatial mode pattern
are important, because the wave-fronts of the beams de-
ﬁne the “ruler” that measures the phase of the atomic
states.

Active feedback is used to control the envelope wave-
form to obtain an accurate Gaussian envelope. Although
just two actuators are provided to stabilize the power of
four beams, the amplitude stabilization is arranged such
that it keeps the Rabi frequency of the transitions in each
of the SCIs constant. However, we will focus on the gen-
eration of frequencies here and thus skip the description
of this part.

Each pair then enters its own single-mode ﬁber with
the same eﬃciency for each of the frequencies. With a
well-aligned setup, we achieve about 180 mW of output
power per frequency, i.e., 600 mW total. For the fre-
quency fm that is the reference for the recoil frequency,

C. Common-mode rejection

Because of the nearly perfect overlap of the beams
within each pair (veriﬁed by the similarity of the ﬁber-
coupling eﬃciencies), any vibrations aﬀect both frequen-
cies nearly equally and thus should have a very slight
eﬀect on the measurement of mfr.

To make the best use of this common-mode rejection,
the beat signal used for the primary phase lock are the
parasitic reﬂections from the input surface of AOM1 (Fig.
5): Any vibrations that cause phase noise before AOM1
are removed by the primary phase lock. Vibrations after
AOM1, however, are common mode and thus rejected.
Vibrations in the signal path of the beat system after
the beam splitter are common to both frequencies and
are rejected by controlling the red laser’s frequency. The
mirror and beam splitter of the beat setup are mounted
rigidly using half-inch optics on a common copper block.
This reduces the inﬂuence of vibrations. The copper
block is electronically temperature stabilized to keep the
optical path length constant to below a wavelength. As
a result, the DC phase between the beat frequencies of
the signals in each of the two ﬁbers is long-term stable
to much below a wavelength. This will be important for
the operation of the secondary phase locks.

D. Secondary phase lock for fm

There are two signiﬁcant frequency diﬀerences between
the laser beams, f0 and fm. The stability of both is
improved by two secondary feedback loops that measure
the noise after the ﬁbers. Since the one for f0 cannot
operate without the other one, we will explain the fm
post-ﬁber phase lock ﬁrst.

∼

The transmission of the signals through ﬁbers and the
vibration of optical elements can introduce many radi-
ans of phase uncertainty. However, as explained, most
of that cancels in our setup. The eﬀective phase noise
that is relevant for the interferometer is given by inte-
grating the noise spectral density shown in Fig. 7, solid
graph, from 1 Hz to about 10 kHz (these limits are rough,
but conservative, estimates based on a pulse duration of
tens of µs and a pulse separation of 0.2 s). We achieve
a
5 mrad rms eﬀective phase noise, already somewhat
better than the above aim of 20 mrad. Still, however,
Fig. 7 (solid graph) shows a pronounced increase of the
noise at frequencies below about 10 kHz. Because of the
common-mode rejection inherent in our setup, this resid-
ual low-frequency noise is too large to be explained sim-
ply by vibrations, even taking into account the dispersion
due to the slight frequency diﬀerences between f1−4. A
clue to the origin of the noise is that the noise at the
outputs of both ﬁbers are uncorrelated. An explanation
for this noise is a vibration of the beam pointing at the
entrance of AOM1: Since the acoustic wavelength λI of
fI within the AOM is only a few microns, a small dis-
placement δ makes the laser beams see the fI at phase
that diﬀers by 2πδ/λI. Since vibrationally induced dila-
tions of the lasers are uncorrelated, the common mode
rejection does not work for this eﬀect.

To remove these inﬂuences, the light is detected on the
platform by three photodetectors, PD1-PD3. PD3 is ac-
tually a quadrant photodetector, where the sum of the
signals from all quadrants is used here; the individual
signals are used for detecting and correcting for any mis-
alignment in the counterpropagation of the laser beams,
see Ref.
[31]. For here, we assume that the beams are
aligned, so that PD3 can be viewed as a simple photode-
tector.

PD1 and 2 detect the output of each ﬁber. Their pho-
tocurrents I1,2 have a Gaussian envelope with a width of
σ and oscillate at fm. The signals are proportional to

For now, we assume a perfect Gaussian envelope. For
the purpose of this discussion, we assume that f1−4 are
deﬁned at the locations of the beat detectors. For the
secondary phase lock, a phase detector is used that basi-
cally measures the timing of the zero crossings of a signal.
Therefore, taking the diﬀerence generates a signal that

After signal preampliﬁcation, the signal is high pass ﬁl-
tered by a ﬁrst order ﬁlter to reject a residual DC signal
due to an imbalance of the average intensities of the light
on PD1 and PD2. Technically, the desired Gaussian en-
velopes can only be generated with a certain inaccuracy.
This might result in slightly diﬀerent envelope waveforms
for both detectors. The DC part of this is rejected by
the high-pass, whereas the time-dependent part can only
partially be rejected. The subsequent electronics basi-
cally detects the phase via the time of the zero-crossings
of the signal. Any oﬀset due to envelope waveform im-
balance thus modulates the detected phase. However,
while ﬂuctuations in the imbalance will lead to noise, an
imbalance cannot lead to a systematic shift of the mea-
surement of fr, since on average they will cancel in the
readout of the interferometer phase since it is common to
all π/2 pulses (unless the ﬂuctuations are systematically
diﬀerent for the third and the fourth π/2 pulse in each
run.)

The signal is then ampliﬁed by a limiting ampliﬁer
made of cascaded diﬀerential ampliﬁers as described in
Ref. [32]. This has a very large gain and will be saturated
by the signal throughout the pulse duration, although the
(truncated) Gaussian envelope has an amplitude ratio of
1000:1 between peak and the lowest value. A square-wave
of constant amplitude is thus generated, which is fed to
DBM2 (Fig. 5) used as phase detector. It compares the
phase of the beat signal to the one of a reference signal
generated by a synthesized function generator with low
phase-noise. The detected phase diﬀerence is used as
the input to a PI controller that adjusts the phase of
the reference signal of the primary phase lock. The PI
controller is switched oﬀ and set to a hold position in the
inter-pulse interval.

Because of the common-mode rejection and the tem-
perature stabilized beat setup of the primary phase lock,
the secondary phase lock only has to make small correc-
tions that do not vary much between pulses. Therefore,
it can be a relatively slow feedback loop of a few kHz
bandwidth.

−

Without use of this secondary phase lock, fm is given
by ∆
fI. Both ∆ and fI are about 170 MHz, whereas
fm is of the order of 1 MHz. Since the phase noise of fre-
quency synthesizers using a reference of a given quality
is approximately proportional to the output frequency, it
is desirable to take fm from a low-frequency reference di-

rectly rather than as the diﬀerence of two higher frequen-
cies. Indeed, the stability of our optical phase locks ex-
ceeds the one of a good synthesizer at 168 MHz, whereas
a synthesizer at 1 MHz can be better. The secondary
phase lock allows to do that (Fig. 5): A reference for
fm is generated directly by a synthesizer, and the sec-
ondary phase lock corrects ∆ to keep fm aligned to that
reference. ∆
fI has to be set to fm to within a few
Hz accuracy by the synthesizer for ∆. Within a typical
pulse duration of 200 µs, the phase correction necessary
is then a few mrad, well within the range of the phase
shifter.

−

It is very important that noise from vibrational varia-
tions of the optical path lengths δLu, δLd from PD1 and
2 to the atoms for the upper and lower beams (Fig. 5) is
cancelled out. In the individual paths, it causes optical

E. Secondary phase-lock for f0

Compared to the frequency fm, the stability require-
ments for f0 are much less stringent, as it drops out of the
ﬁnal result. Nevertheless, the phase ﬂuctuations should
be small compared to π/(n/2), because otherwise they
will wash out the fringes of the individual interferome-
ters (n/2 is the order of the Bragg diﬀraction). However,
f0 is the diﬀerence of frequencies transmitted in separate
optical ﬁbers. Since the optical path length ﬂuctuations
of the ﬁbers are essentially uncorrelated, they fully con-
tribute to the noise in f0; there is no common-mode rejec-
tion as for fr. Therefore, a stabilization is also necessary
for the phase of the f0 component.

Since the phase ﬂuctuations in f0 exceed π even on
timescales below a second, the phase at the start of each
pulse is unknown, i.e., it may be anything between 0
and 2π. For the truncated Gaussian pulses with σ
15 µs and a total duration of

∼
200 µs, lock must be

∼

9

acquired in much below a microsecond so that the phase
is unstabilized only over a negligible fraction of the pulse
duration.

Because of the speed requirement, an electro-optic
modulator (New Focus) installed before one of the ﬁber
inputs is used as a phase shifter (Fig. 5). It requires a
voltage of about 400 V for generating a phase shift of 2π.
For reasons of causality, the minimum time required for
acquiring lock is 2-3 times the total delay in the feed-
back loop. This contains about 40 ns delay due to the
optical path length and signal cables. It is thus desired
to have the same or higher speed in the electronics used
for lock. Especially the high-voltage ampliﬁer is usu-
ally rather slow. Thus, we built an ampliﬁer capable of
generating 400 V signals with tr = 50 ns rise-time, using
electron tubes in the output stage [33]. This is about
10 times faster than the hybrid technology high-voltage
operational ampliﬁers that are otherwise used. The PI
servo is built using 200 MHz gain-bandwidth product op-
erational ampliﬁers and has a negligible contribution to
the overall delay. The system acquires lock with a time
constant of about 0.25 µs. It is switched oﬀ in the inter-
pulse interval.

1. Signal processing

The beat signal after the ﬁbers consists of six Fourier
components (compare Fig. 6): two at fm that add con-
fm and f0 + fm, and two
structively, one each at f0 −
components at f0 that cancel each other if the ampli-
tudes are properly balanced. The fm component has a
frequency <
1 MHz while the others are above 5 MHz.
∼
Thus, fm can be suppressed by a high-order high pass
ﬁlter. The remaining signal is shown in the time-domain
in Fig. 8 (above): It has an overall Gaussian envelope.
The enlarged portion shown in Fig. 8 (below) reveals the
fm signal as an envelope of an oscillation at f0.

Since the phase of fm is already extremely accurately
controlled, we are left with stabilizing the ’carrier’ at f0.
However, at the zeroes of the fm envelope, the phase
of the f0 signal is switched by 180◦. This reverses the
sign of the feedback loop for the f0 phase. Therefore,
the sign has to be electronically reversed synchronously
in order to obtain a stable lock. To do that, we syn-
thesize an appropriate reference signal with appropriate
polarity switching by feeding electronic reference signals
at f0 and fm into the two inputs of DBM3 (Fig. 5). The
output signal is converted to a square-wave of constant
amplitude by a limiter.

Because of the high speed of the servo loop, the syn-
chronism between the synthesized signal and the zero-
crossings in the optically generated beat signal depicted
in Fig. 8 must be better than about 200 ns, or the servo
could make cycle slips at each zero-crossing of fm. At
fm = 10 kHz, for example, 200 ns correspond to 2 mrad
phase shift that would be generated by a 1.6 nm motion
of one mirror in the optical setup. It is thus important

that the accuracy of the secondary phase lock for fm is
much better than 1 mrad.

The performance of the system is shown in Fig. 9:
In the unstabilized case (upper graph), the phase noise
is strongest at about 200 Hz oﬀset from the carrier, due
to mechanical resonances of mirror mounts. With stabi-
lization (lower graph), this noise is suppressed by about
30 dB to a standard error of √σ2
0.05 rad. This is low
compared to π/(n/2) even for n = 10 photon transitions.

∼

2. Vibration cancellation

As f0 accounts for the Doppler eﬀect due to the free-fall
motion of the atoms and therefore also for the Doppler
shift due to vibrations, such a stabilization will also
strongly reduce the sensitivity of the individual interfer-
ometers to vibrations, thus making an active vibration
isolation unnecessary (a simple passive stage at the bot-
tom of the interferometer is suﬃcient). This is because
the phase of f0 can be measured after the beams have
passed the interferometers, so that the measurement con-

tains the vibrationally induced ﬂuctuations. Feedback to
the laser phase can then reduce them. Without the lock,
a high-performance vibration isolation would be required
fo all optics on top and at the bottom of the fountain
[23, 34, 35].

F. Performance of the system and conclusions

With the secondary PLL for fm (Fig. 5), we measure
the residual noise in the diﬀerential phase. To make this
measurement as realistic as possible, we use another two
beat detectors at locations in the optical path that are
close to the vacuum chamber. We add their frequencies
using a DBM to obtain 2fm. We ﬁnd the noise shown
as dashed graph in Fig. 7. At 1 Hz oﬀset from the car-
rier, it has a level of -90 dBc/Hz. It falls down to about
-120 dBc/Hz at 100 Hz. At 400 kHz, it starts to drop
again, eventually reaching -138 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz. For
the interferometers, the laser beams are applied in the
form of Gaussian pulses having a width of σ and a spac-
ing of T . The noise that enters the phase readout can
thus be approximated by integrating the noise spectral
10 kHz. Thus,
density from 2/(πT )
≈
≈
10−4 rad in
we obtain a rms phase uncertainty of 1.6
10−5 rad in fm. For n = N = 10 and
2fm, and 8
T = 0.2 s in the SCIs, this will contribute 0.15 ppb of un-
certainty in the SCIs’ phase, see Eq. 9. Laser noise will
thus no longer be a limiting factor.

Usually in atom interferometers, this phase uncertainty

the vibration of mirrors. Thus, a resolution

period of weeks. Our improvement is due to the combi-
nation of the common-mode rejection inherent to SCIs,
due to a setup that provides cancellation of path-length
ﬂuctuations, and due to the phase-locks described above,
which lock precisely the signiﬁcant phase of fm.

Note that the phase noise of -90 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz corre-
sponds to a relative frequency noise of 10−19 at 1 s inte-
gration time. For comparison, this level of relative stabil-
ity is the one reached in gravitational wave detectors like
GEO600 and LIGO for time-scales below about 20ms,
where shielding from vibrational noise becomes eﬀective.

V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

We have described our project to measure h/mCs, the
ratio of the Planck constant to the cesium mass to an
accuracy of below 0.5 parts per billion. Such a mea-
surement would allow us to determine the ﬁne structure
constant α and to test the theory of quantum electrody-
namics. After a brief outline of the project, we concen-
trated on describing the laser system that will provide for
the atomic beam splitters and the readout of the atomic
phase. The emphasis is on the feedback loops that are
used to reduce the laser phase-noise at the location of
the atoms. We did not describe the system that will en-
sure accurate counterpropagation of the beams, as this is
described elsewhere [31]. Also, we did not describe the
operation of the atomic fountain.

The interferometer laser system depicts an eﬀective
10−5 mrad for one single inter-
phase uncertainty of 8
ferometer run, which corresponds to an improvement by

×

11

a factor of 103−4 relative to previous experiments. This
provides for an inaccuracy of 0.3 ppb in a single mea-
surement. This demonstrates the potential of SCIs to
increase the resolution in atom interferometers.

Besides various sources of noise, many systematic ef-
fects will have to be considered. Examples for the present
experiments are discussed in [5, 6, 14]. The present
experiment has signiﬁcantly reduced inﬂuences of laser
phase noise, beam misalignment (by stabilization of the
relative propagation direction [31]), and the index of re-
fraction of cold atoms studied in [36] (by going to a rela-
tively large detuning). The characterization and removal
of systematic errors is facilitated by low noise, as this
allows to run the experiment at full resolution within a
short integration time. Improved accuracy by about one
order of magnitude can thus hopefully be achieved.

Measuring h/mCs will be one of the most important
goals of future atom interferometry space missions. The
microgravity environment there allows longer interaction
times and reduces some systematic eﬀects. Since this will
allow to make full use of the phase stability we reached
for our SCIs, we believe that there is a strong case for
the application of SCIs in such experiments.

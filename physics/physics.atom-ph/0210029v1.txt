The ﬁltered laser excitation technique was applied for measuring transition frequencies of the Ca2
B-X system from asymptotic levels of the X1Σ+
= 38. That level has
−1 below the molecular 1S+1S
an outer classical turning point of about 20 ˚A which is only 0.2 cm
asymptote. Extensive analysis of the spectroscopic data, involving Monte Carlo simulation, allowed
for a purely experimental determination of the long range parameters of the potential energy curve.
The possible values of the s-wave scattering length could be limited to be between 250a0 and 1000a0.

INTRODUCTION

In our previous paper [1] we reported on an accu-
rate determination of the Ca2 X1Σ+
g ground state po-
tential energy curve (PEC) from Laser Induced Fluo-
rescense (LIF) spectroscopy. The study was motivated
by the rapid progress in the development of the Ca
frequency standard [2] and the recent photoassociation
spectroscopy data on the 1S0+1P1 asymptote [3].
It
was considered as the ﬁrst step of a comprehensive in-
vestigation, which should provide a description of the X
state for short and intermediate internuclear distances,
thus enabling the precise determination of the long range
part of the PEC, for example from photoassociation spec-
troscopy or from a molecular beam experiment.

The results of the LIF experiments, however, suggested
that in the case of Ca2 it might be possible to make a
reasonable description of the long range part of PEC al-
ready by means of a classical spectroscopy. Here we mean
the shallow potential well of the Ca dimer, which lead to
thermal population even of the highest rovibrational lev-
els for normal working temperatures (1220 K), so that a
single laser scheme could be applied for their excitation.
Of great importance is also the possibility to extend the
description of the PEC by a long range dispersive expan-
sion already from 9.4 ˚A [1].

For detecting transitions from ground state levels with
v′′ > 35 we applied the Filtered Laser Excitation (FLE)
technique, which was used also by Hofmann et al. [4] for
studying the A1Σ+
u excited state in Ca2. With this tech-
nique we collected spectroscopic information for about
24 highly excited levels of the X state with v′′ up to 38.
The outer classical turning point of the last observed level
with v′′ = 38 and J ′′ = 10 is at 20 ˚A and is located on
the rotationally reduced potential only 0.2 cm−1 below
the molecular asymptote.

Although the FLE resolution was limited by the
Doppler broadening, we will demonstrate that combining
the data from [1] and this experiment, it is possible to

nications, ul. Hajdushka poliana 8, 1612 Soﬁa, Bulgaria

reduce the uncertainty of the experimentally determined
long range coeﬃcients, and especially C6 to an extent, to
compare them with the results of the most recent theo-
retical predictions [5, 6].

In section II we explain the experimental set up and
discuss the achieved experimental resolution and uncer-
tainties. Section III summarizes the methods for con-
structing of the PEC. Analysis of the experimental data
are performed in section IV, where we employed a Monte
Carlo simulation in order to determine the error limits of
the ﬁtted long range parameters of the PEC.

II. EXPERIMENT

The calcium dimers are obtained in a heat pipe oven
already described in Ref. [1]. The experiments are per-
formed at helium or argon buﬀer gas under a typical
pressure of 20 − 50 mbar and an oven temperature of
1220 K. Working with argon as buﬀer gas enables us to
reduce the pressure to a lower value than with helium
without reducing the life time of the heat pipe due to
solid calcium closing the optical path. In the frequency
range accessible by the lasers in our group the most fa-
vorable Franck-Condon factors between the levels close
to the asymptote of the X1Σ+
g state and the levels of
u state (v′ = 2) are less than 10−2.
the B1Σ+
In order
to achieve a suﬃcient signal-to-noise ratio using Fourier
transform spectroscopy a long term stability in the oper-
ation of the oven is needed which is not achievable with
our present apparatus. In addition, as it was mentioned
in Ref.[1], the discrete ﬂuorescence is accompanied by
a strong background emission due to bound-bound-free
and free-bound-free molecular transitions. To overcome
this problems we chose the ﬁltered laser excitation (FLE)
technique for direct excitation of the levels close to the
asymptote of the ground state.

A 1 m monochromator (GCA/McPherson Instru-
ments) used as a narrow band pass ﬁlter of a typical
window width 2 cm−1 is set on a strong line of the ﬂu-
orescence progression when exciting a transition to a se-
lected rotational level with v′ = 2 of the B state using a
single mode dye laser (Coumarine 6). Then the laser op-
erating around 550 nm (60 mW on the Ca2 sample) scans

2

FIG. 1: Experimental setup

the frequencies of transitions from near asymptote levels
of the ground state to the selected v′ = 2 level. Laser
frequencies resonant with such transitions will result in
ﬂuorescence, which matches the transmission band of the
ﬁlter and can be detected. The signal after the monochro-
mator is recorded as a function of the laser wavelength by
a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu, R928). Although many
other transitions of the X-B system contribute to the ab-
sorption spectrum of Ca2 in the scanned spectral region,
only excitations which decay into the selected frequency
window will be registered. Thus this selective technique
provides greatly simpliﬁed absorption spectra in a region
where the weak transitions from the asymptotic levels of
interest are practically completely overlapped by other
much stronger transitions.

The relative positions of the FLE lines are calibrated
using the frequency comb of a temperature stabilized
Fabry-Perot interferometer with a free spectral range of
149.75(1) MHz. The absolute line position is obtained
using the absorption spectrum of iodine vapor at room
temperature (ﬁg. 1) calibrated with the IodineSpec cal-
culating software with which the positions of the iodine
lines are predicted with an accuracy better than 3MHz
in the studied frequency range [7, 8]. In order to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio each spectrum is recorded sev-
eral times. Before the averaging procedure, the recorded
signal is normalized to the laser intensity to minimize the
inﬂuence of its variations with frequency and time. The
typical width of the observed lines is 0.05 cm−1 corre-
sponding to the Doppler broadening. The intensity of the
slowly varying background due to free-bound-free or free-
bound-bound transitions of the B-X system is compara-
ble to the intensity of the strongest lines and is mainly
responsible for the noise in the spectra. Taking account
of the linewidth, the signal-to-noise ratio and the uncer-
tainty in the calibration with the I2 lines, the uncertainty
of the absolute frequency for the strongest lines is esti-
mated to be 0.0035 cm−1. Two typical spectra are shown
in ﬁg.2 for low and intermediate J. The experimental
traces as solid lines contain some gaps which were not
scanned. The number above the line gives v′′ and the
inset gives v′ and J ′ of the excited state.

Using the FLE technique we observed transitions from
44 ground state levels and among them 24 close to the
asymptote with v′′ ≥ 35. The last observed levels are

thetic spectra used for assignment of the observed spectral
features are shown.

(v′′ = 38, J ′′ = 6, 8, 10) as summarized in the data ﬁeld
in ﬁg. 3. The assignment of the new observed lines is
performed using the potential energy curve determined
in our previous study of the ground state [1] and a nu-
merical potential of the B state determined from the data
available in the literature [9]. Simulations of the transi-
tions by these potentials for selected detection windows
are presented in ﬁgure 2 as dotted lines. These lines are
shifted vertically with respect to the observed traces in
order to show clearly the quality of the simulation. The
intensity of the synthetic spectrum is determined by the
appropriate Franck-Condon factors, by the thermal pop-
ulation of the ground state levels and by the selected
detection window. The small diﬀerences between the ob-
served and the simulated spectral features could be at-
tributed to the limited accuracy of the B state PEC (0.05
cm−1) and to the fact that the used ground state poten-
tial was determined for levels with only v′′ ≤ 35. Also,
only transitions in the main calcium isotopomer, 40Ca2
were simulated. The unambiguity of the assignment was
usually proved further by the observation of relatively
long (5-6 vibrational quanta) and self consistent vibra-
tional progressions of P,R doublets.

With the present set-up we can study the inﬂuence of
the collisions between calcium dimers and the buﬀer gas
by changing its pressure since no additional instrumental
broadening on the lines is present. We found that the

quantum numbers of the

collisional broadening and the shift of the observed lines
are much smaller than what was previously assumed [1].
This means that the experimental uncertainties of the
transitions obtained in that study were overestimated.

For completeness we enriched our data with progres-
sions obtained by LIF using the 501 nm, 488 nm and 457
nm lines of an Argon ion laser (Spectra Physics, Beam-
Lok 2060) recorded by Fourier transform spectroscopy.
Most of the transitions which are known to be excited
by these lines [10] were observed in this study. The
present set of transitions representing all the LIF and
FLE data covers a range of rotational quantum numbers
from J ′′ = 4 to 164 and a range of vibrational quantum
numbers from v′′ = 0 to 38. We have recorded a total
of 3580 transitions resulting in 924 levels of the ground
state [16].

During this study six atomic calcium lines were
also observed around 1.9µm, which correspond to the
3D1,2,3 → 3P1,2,3 transitions, when irradiating the sam-
ple by Ar+ laser lines. These transitions have been al-
ready observed in Mg in a similar experiment [11]. Here
they could be attributed to predissociation of the molecu-
lar B state through a coupling with repulsive states corre-
lated to the 3D + 1S asymptotes. It is worth mentioning
that the 3D1,2,3 → 3P1,2,3 transitions were observed
also at temperatures down to 950 K, which suggests that
the ﬁrst step of the process is predominantly excitation
of pairs of free Ca atoms by the laser radiation to the
molecular B state. The intensity ratio between the in-
frared emission and the laser light was highest for the
457 nm Ar+ line and decreases with the increase of the
laser wavelength.

After a new examination of the previous Fourier trans-
form spectra using the new potential energy curve which
will be presented in the following, three unassigned weak
molecular progressions were found to belong to the cal-
cium isotopomer 44Ca40Ca. The exciting transitions were
identiﬁed as (0, 42)←(4, 43) and (0, 72)←(5, 73) at
18788.36 cm−1 and (0, 111)←(8, 112) at 18787.36 cm−1.

III. CONSTRUCTION OF PEC

Following the approach adopted in the previous report
[1], information which concerns only the ground state was
extracted from the raw spectroscopic data. From transi-
tion frequencies with a common upper state level, diﬀer-
ences between ground state levels were calculated. The
PEC for the ground state was then constructed, which
describes these experimentally observed diﬀerences. Sim-
ilar to Ref.[1] the possible combinations of line frequen-
cies within a progression were restricted only to pairs of
one P and one R lines, forming a total of 8500 diﬀerences.
The methods for construction of PEC were discussed
in detail in Ref. [1] and will be summarized only brieﬂy
here.

The ﬁrst method represents the potential as a trun-

cated expansion over analytic functions:

U (R) =

n

Xi=0

ai

R − Rm
R + bRm (cid:19)

(cid:18)

i

,

(1)

where ai, b and Rm are parameters (Rm is close to the
equilibrium distance). For short and long internuclear
distances the potential is smoothly extended respectively
for R ≤ Rinn with

A + B/R12

(2)

and for R ≥ Rout with

De − C6/R6 − C8/R8 − C10/R10.

(3)

Here De is the value of the dissociation energy deﬁned
with respect to the minimum of the PEC. Since Rout is
usually chosen within the region where the contribution
of the exchange energy is negligible, no additional dump-
ing (or cut oﬀ) functions for the dispersion coeﬃcients
are introduced.

Parameters ai and C6 and C8 are ﬁtted in a nonlinear
ﬁtting procedure (for details see [12]), while A, B, C10
and De are adjusted by the program in order to ensure
smooth connection between the extensions and the an-
alytic form. Rm, b and the connecting points Rinn and
Rout are kept ﬁxed to values, which allow fast conver-
gence of the ﬁtting routine.

The second method deﬁnes the PEC for short and in-
termediate internuclear distances as a set of points con-
nected with cubic spline function. For large internuclear
distances the same long range expansion as in (3) is used.
The values of the potential Ui in a preselected grid of
points, De, C6, C8 and C10 are treated as ﬁtting param-
eters. They are determined in an iterative ﬁtting routine,
which linearizes the problem by using a modiﬁed version
of the inverted perturbation approach [13]. The connect-
ing point Rout is chosen in the following way. Initially,
the PEC is constructed in a pointwise form up to 13 ˚A.

Then only the long range parameters are ﬁtted assuming
that Rout = 9.5 ˚A. Although both sections of the PEC are
determined independently, their shapes turn out to be al-
most identical between 9.5 ˚A and 13 ˚A. As a last step the
C10 coeﬃcient of the long range expansion is slightly ad-
justed (the change does not exceed few percent) in order
to ﬁt best the shape of the pointwise potential between
9.4 ˚A and 10 ˚A. The crossing point of the pointwise and
the long range curves is taken as Rout. The new value of
Rout diﬀers from that which was used when ﬁtting the
long range parameters. Usually the change is small (typ-
ically 0.1 ˚A) and since the two sections are very close in
this region, the eﬀect of such a change on the quality of
the ﬁt is negligible. Of course, a second iteration could
be performed with the new value of Rout, but usually it
is necessary only in the beginning, when the initial values
of the ﬁtting parameters are far from the best ones.

Before ﬁtting the PEC to the new data set, the exper-
imental errors of the data obtained by LIF were reana-
lyzed, since the value of the normalized standard devia-
tion σ ≈ 0.45 given in the previous study (Ref. [1]) signals
their overestimation. The value of the uncertainty before
was chosen to be 0.01 cm−1 for a strong LIF line in order
to take into account possible frequency shifts due to col-
lisions. Since the new FLE measurements showed that
the probable inﬂuence of the temperature and the buﬀer
gas pressure are much smaller than expected we reduced
the errors of all LIF frequencies by a factor of 0.6, which
will give a more realistic estimate on the error limits of
the ﬁtted PEC parameters.

The analytic potential listed in table I describes the
diﬀerences between the observed spectral lines from both
experiments with a standard deviation σ = 0.0064 cm−1
and normalized standard deviation ¯σ=0.69. The quality
of the PEC for the near asymptotic levels is estimated
by calculation the standard deviation with a reduced set
of diﬀerences, where for each diﬀerence at least one level
belongs to v′′ ≥ 35. We obtained σ35 = 0.0092 cm−1
and ¯σ35 = 0.92. The same parameters for the numeri-
cal potential (table II) are σ = 0.0068 cm−1, ¯σ = 0.74
and σ35 = 0.0092 cm−1, ¯σ35 = 0.89.
In order to cal-
culate the value of the pointwise potential in the range
R < 9.44 ˚A, a natural cubic spline through all the grid
points should be used. The parameters of both curves
are chosen such, that their minima are set to zero. In or-
der to facilitate the comparison between the dissociation
energies D0 deﬁned with respect to the lowest rovibra-
tional level (v′′ = 0, J ′′ = 0), their values are given in
tables I and II as additional parameters.

IV. UNCERTAINTIES OF THE LONG RANGE
PARAMETERS

The motivation of this study is not only to describe the
rovibrational structure of the 40Ca2 ground state. We
rather want to examine to which extent the performed
spectroscopic study is able to go beyond the reproduction

of the observed diﬀerences between ground state levels.
Of greatest interest is the reliability of the determined
long range parameters (and especially C6) since they play
an important role in phenomena involving two interacting
cold Ca atoms in the ground state.

Our analysis relies on two main assumptions:

• the interaction between two Ca atoms can be de-
scribed within an adiabatic picture, through a sin-
gle channel model applying the one dimensional
Schr¨odinger equation with an eﬀective potential en-
ergy curve;

• the shape of the potential for internuclear distances
R ≥ 9.4 ˚A can be described with the long range
expression (3), neglecting the exchange energy.

Due to the zero net electronic and nuclear spin in the
case of 40Ca and the large energy separation between
the ground state and the lowest excited states the ﬁrst
assumption seems to be well justiﬁed. The second one is
supported by the expected small value of the exchange
energy [1, 14] at 9.5 ˚A and the dominant van der Waals
character of the interaction.

Under these assumptions we ask the question: what are
the variations of the PEC parameters around the ﬁtted
ones which are still in agreement with the experimental
data?

In Ref. [1] the answer was given by plotting a contour
plot of the likehood function χ2 by varying the long range
parameters. For the nonlinear ﬁtting procedures it is,
however, not straightforward how to use the contour plot
in order to determine the conﬁdence interval of the pa-
rameters since it is not obvious to which conﬁdence limit
a given contour corresponds. That is why there is some
ambiguity in the probable errors of the ﬁtted parameters
determined only by using contour plots. The use of the
matrix of variances and covariances, which is obtained
by the ﬁtting routines in the linearized form is not useful

errors of the experimental frequencies being independent
and following a normal distribution, the quantities which
enter the ﬁt are actually diﬀerences between these fre-
quencies. Consequently their errors are not independent
and we are not allowed to interpret the above mentioned
matrix as in the case of independent data points.

A possible way to get the probability distribution of the
ﬁtted parameters is to perform a Monte Carlo simulation
of synthetic data.

A. Monte Carlo simulation

Since our experimental data come with some measure-
ment uncertainties, which we assume to be normally dis-
tributed, the set c(0) of the ﬁtted parameters of the PEC
will diﬀer from the true one c(t). If we perform a series
of similar experiments the experimental data sets will be
slightly diﬀerent and consequently we will obtain diﬀer-
ent sets of ﬁtted parameters c(i)
exp. Having a suﬃcient
number of measurement sets we could plot the distribu-
tion of c(i)
exp and then decide what are the most probable
values and what are their uncertainties.

So let us assume that the ﬁtted potential U (0)(R),
described with a set of parameters c(0), is not too far
from the true one. Then, knowing the experimental un-
certainty associated with each observed transition fre-
quency, we can synthesize a set of experimental data
which will have exactly the same structure as the real
one (measurement errors, distribution of v and J quan-
tum numbers). For this goal transition frequencies are
formed using the eigenvalues for U (0)(R) (since the up-
per state levels play no role in our analysis their ener-
gies could be set to zero) and adding to each calculated
frequency a small random quantity normally distributed
with mean value zero and a standard deviation equal to
the experimental error. Then we transform the synthetic
frequencies into synthetic diﬀerences and use the same
ﬁtting procedure in order to obtain a new set of param-
eters c(i)
sim. Performing a large number of simulations we

can plot the distribution of c(i)
sim − c(0). Since the simu-
lated data are related statistically to U (0)(R) in the same
way as the real experimental data to the true potential
and since these two potentials were assumed to be close
to each other the obtained distribution should be not too
diﬀerent from that of c(i)
exp − c(t).

In order to realize these ideas we used the pointwise
representation of the potential since in the present real-
ization of our computer codes it allows more ﬂexibility in
connecting the long range expansion with the potential
curve at intermediate internuclear distances. The prize to
pay for this is that the ﬁrst derivative of the PEC might
have a small “kink” in Rout. This problem, however,
does not inﬂuence the analysis of the PEC and it could
be avoided by slight adjustment of the pointwise curve.
What we win is that all the long range parameters are ﬁt-
ted to the experimental data independently of the actual
shape of the potential at intermediate internuclear dis-
tances. The continuity of the potential is ensured mainly
by varying the connecting point Rout and to a smaller ex-
tend C10. Analysis similar to those, performed in Ref. [1]
showed that the present body of experimental data ﬁxes
the inner part of the PEC approximately between 3.5 ˚A
and 9.5 ˚A. Possible variations in this region are connected
mainly with the experimental uncertainties and the in-
ﬂuence of the selected representation for the potential is
negligible. Therefore we may expect that the choice of
the connecting point Rout around 9.5 ˚A makes our anal-
ysis almost independent of the functions used to model
the PEC at short internuclear distances.

v1J1 − E(i)

Having generated a set of
v1J1,v2J2 = E(i)

synthetic diﬀerences
∆E(i)
v2J2 we treat them as the exper-
imental data. U (0)(R) is taken as initial potential and a
small correction to it is ﬁtted which should minimize the
diﬀerence between ∆E(i)
v1J1,v2J2 and the diﬀerences cal-
culated with the corrected potential. The correction is
deﬁned as follows:

an equidistant grid of internuclear distances Ri and δDe,
δC6, δC8, δC10 are the corrections to the long range pa-
rameters. Using the theory of perturbations the shift of

are the corresponding mean values of Si(R) and R−j
calculated with the wave functions ΨvJ (R) of the levels
forming the diﬀerence.

Note that in principle the exact presentation of U (0)(R)
is not of importance since we study only the possible
small variations around it which are still allowed by the
experimental data. The advantage of expressing the cor-
rection to the potential in a pointwise form (cubic spline
function is used for interpolation) is that the inﬂuence of
the parameters δui is localized in R, since away from Ri
Si(R) decays exponentially [13]. This gives a high ﬂexi-
bility in constructing the needed form of the correction.
Additionally, the correlations between δui are introduced
mainly by the experimental data and not by the selected
basis functions.

With each set of simulated data a new ﬁt is performed
which adjusts δui, δDe, δC6, δC8 and δC10. Along with
this we examine the contributions due to δui and the long
range corrections to the ﬁtted diﬀerences (the sums in
Eq. 6). As it could be expected, the changes of the PEC
for R < Rout are very small (δui ∼ 0.01 cm−1) for all sets
of synthetic data due to the large amount of experimental
observations in this region. In addition the corrections to
the diﬀerences due to δui, i.e. the ﬁrst term of the right
side of eq. 6, turn out to be smaller than the correspond-
ing experimental uncertainties and in principle one could
neglect them. We checked this and, indeed, the distri-
bution of the long range parameters was almost identical
for simulations with and without ﬁtting δui. Since this
is true for diﬀerent numbers of δui parameters, we may
consider it as a proof of the statement made above, that
in the present case the determination of the long range
parameters is almost independent on the model used to
describe the inner part of the PEC.

The positions of the energy levels and the molecular
asymptote De in Ref. [1] were deﬁned with respect to
the minimum of the PEC, Umin. Then we estimated that

the possible variation of Umin for diﬀerent representations
of the potential is of the order of 0.01 cm−1, which was
smaller than the uncertainty of the dissociation energy,
0.09 cm−1. With the extended experimental data set
and after the revision of the experimental uncertainties
we are now able to give a much better prediction of the
dissociation energy with uncertainty also of the order of
0.01 cm−1. Obviously deﬁning the dissociation energy
with respect to Umin will introduce an undesired increase
of the uncertainty for this long range parameter. Con-
sequently, starting from here we will consider only the
value of the dissociation energy D0 deﬁned with respect
to the lowest rovibrational level E00 = Ev′′=0,J ′′=0. In-
deed, ﬁtting δui to the simulated data we convinced our-
selves that although the shape of the potential (and also
Umin) could vary slightly from ﬁt to ﬁt, the overall eﬀect
on the position of E00 is much smaller than the typical
variation of Umin. Nevertheless, the contribution of E00
to the uncertainty of D0 is taken into account.

In this way, the main steps of the performed Monte

Carlo analysis are:

1. Find the PEC U (0)(R) which can reproduce the
experimental observations with smallest standard
deviation;

2. From the eigenvalues for U (0)(R) generate a set of
synthetic data by adding normally distributed ran-
dom deviations according the experimental uncer-
tainties. This set has exactly the same structure as
the experimental data;

3. Perform a ﬁt with the synthetic data as it was done
with the original one and collect the obtained po-
tential parameters in a distribution list;

4. Repeat steps (2)-(4) until enough simulated long
range parameters are collected in order to analyze
their distribution.

B. Results

In ﬁgure 4 two projections of the long range parameters
distribution obtained from 3000 simulations are shown.
It is worth mentioning the strong correlation between C6
and C8, which is the case also for the other pairs of dis-
persive coeﬃcients. In order to determine the conﬁdence
regions for the parameters we construct an ellipse in the
four dimensional space of the parameters, whose axes
have such orientations and relative lengths that the re-
sulting surface follows the form of the distribution. Then
we change gradually the lengths of the axes by a constant
factor and count the number of points which are enclosed
by the ellipse. For example, the ellipse which contains
68.3 % of the points will determine the 68.3 % (1σ) con-
ﬁdence region of the parameters. The projections of the
68.3 % and the 90 % conﬁdence regions (strictly speaking
the contours surrounding the projections) are plotted in
the left part of ﬁgure 4 for the pair of parameters D0 and
C6.

This allows us to determine the mean value and un-
certainty of the dissociation energy of the 40Ca2 ground
state with respect to the lowest rovibrational level as
1069.868 ± 0.010 cm−1 and of the C6 coeﬃcient as
(1.003 ± 0.033) · 107 cm−1˚A6 at a conﬁdence limit of
68.3 %. The values and the uncertainties of all the long
range parameters are summarized in table III and com-
pared with the values from other sources.

The highest observed rovibrational level in Ref. [1] had
v′′ = 35 and it was concluded that with the available
experimental data set it is not possible to give any rea-
sonable estimation for C6. Now, by using a Monte Carlo
analysis we can be more rigorous. In ﬁgure 5 we compare
the projections of two distributions on the D0-C6 plane.
The ﬁrst one is derived using only the data from Ref. [1]
before the revision of those experimental errors. In order
to obtain a meaningful estimation of the dissociation en-

FIG. 5: Projections of the long range parameters distributions
on the D0-C6 plane derived from the LIF data from Ref. [1]
and from this study (the black spot in the centre).

FIG. 6: Projections of the long range parameters distributions
on the D0-C6 plane derived by assuming the validity of the
long range expansion from 9.4 ˚A (solid circles) and from 10
˚A (open circles).

ergy of the X state, we restricted in Ref. [1] the possible
variation of C6 within a ± 5 % interval around the the-
oretical value [5]. This interval is denoted in ﬁg. 5 with
horizontal dashed lines and leads to an uncertainty of the
dissociation energy similar to that, given in Ref. [1]. Af-
ter including the new LIF and FLE data the distribution
shrinks to the small black spot in the centre of ﬁgure 5
(see also the inset), which is actually the distribution
from ﬁgure 4. It would be, however, not correct to inter-
pret the drastic reduction of the size of the distribution
only as a result of the transitions involving rovibrational
levels with v′′ > 35. In fact the items, which led to the
distribution presented in ﬁgure 4 are:

• The assumption that the long range expansion (3)
is valid starting from 9.4 ˚A. This allows to link the
values of the long range parameters with the fre-
quency diﬀerences involving levels with 30 ≤ v′′ ≤
38, i.e.
the shape of the long range potential is
roughly tested from 9.4 ˚A up to ≈ 20 ˚A (the clas-
sical turning point of the last observed level). A
Monte Carlo simulation shows (ﬁgure 6) the change
of the distribution when shifting Rout from 9.4 ˚A
only by 0.6 ˚A to Rout = 10 ˚A. Note, that in this
case the loss of accuracy on C6 is larger by a factor
of two compared to the increase of the D0 uncer-
tainty;

• Availability of highly excited levels with v′′ = 38,
since they limit the variation of the dissociation
energy;

• The enlargement of the experimental data, which
allow accurate determination of the PEC for short
and intermediate internuclear distances. Because of
the large body of data, the long range parameters
are almost independent of the exact representation

of the rest part of the PEC, which is clearly indi-
cated by the small variations of δui (eq. 6) during
the statistical analysis;

• The corrected estimate of the experimental uncer-

tainties of the data in Ref. [1].

C. The value of the C6 coeﬃcient

The conﬁdence interval for C6 given in this paper
(1.003 ± 0.033) · 107 cm−1˚A6 does not overlap with the
most recent theoretical prediction of (1.070 ± 0.006) · 107
cm−1˚A6 within the error stated in Ref. [5].

From our side, we realize that an important point in
our analysis is the assumption for the validity of the long
range expansion (3) down to ≈ 9.4 ˚A. As it was shown in
ﬁg. 6, shifting Rout to larger internuclear distances will
increase the uncertainty on the ﬁtted parameters. The
same will happen if we introduce additional terms into
the long range model (for example the exchange energy).
Our analysis can readily include these additional param-
eters, provided there are new experimental observations
which require this.

D. The s-wave scattering length

In order to obtain the s-wave scattering length and its
conﬁdence interval, it is straightforward to calculate its
value for each of the simulated PEC. These calculations
will show how reliably the spectroscopically determined
potential up to ≈ 20 ˚A can be applied to model cold
collisions. The results are presented in ﬁg. 7a. The po-
sition of the last bound level (v′′ = 40) with respect to
the molecular assymptote, D0 − Ev′′=40,J ′′=0 is shown in

ﬁg. 7b. The values of the scattering length a within the
68.3 % conﬁdence region vary from 250a0 to 1000a0 (the
Bohr radius a0 ≈ 0.52918 ˚A). Since these values indicate
a bound level very close to the asymptote (several MHz,
see ﬁg. 7b),initially we were surprised that from our much
less accurate data (several 100 MHz) we can make such
a good prediction of the position of the last bound level.
Obviously the large amount of observed data ﬁxes the ac-
cumulated phase of the wave function for this level along
the PEC up to ≈ 20 ˚A and the variation of the binding
energy with respect to the asymptote is restricted mainly
by the uncertainty of C6. In addition, from ﬁgure 7b we
see that the smaller the binding energy, the less sensitive
it is to the uncertainties of the other long range param-
eters.

The inner wall of the potential (R < 3.5 ˚A), however, is
not well ﬁxed by the experimental data. Could its change
shift the last level by several MHz without inﬂuencing
the positions of the other levels? The answer is negative.
The wave functions for small internuclear distances for
the highly excited levels diﬀer only by a constant factor.
For example, for a PEC with binding energy D0 − E40 ≈
3 MHz for v′′ = 40, the shapes of the wave functions for
v′′ = 40 and v′′ = 35 are almost identical up to 7.5 ˚A
and the ratio between them is:

Ψv′′=35(R)
Ψv′′=40(R)

≈ 35 for R < 7.5 ˚A.

(9)

So, using the perturbation theory it is clear, that a
change of the potential for R < 3.5 ˚A, which will shift
the position of the level with v′′ = 40 by 1 MHz will
shift the level with v′′ = 35 by ≈ 1.2 GHz (0.04 cm−1).
Since this change will not alter for example the position
of the lowest level (v′′ = 0), the introduced shift of the
diﬀerence Ev′′=35 − Ev′′=0 will exceed the experimental
uncertainty roughly by a factor of 6, which is a contra-
diction.

Due to the revised conﬁdence interval for the C6, the
uncertainty of the scattering length was not reduced
compared to Ref. [1] (112a0 ÷ 800a0), although the un-
certainty of C6 itself is smaller than the assumed one
in Ref. [1] (±5 % around the theoretical prediction of
1.07 · 107 cm−1˚A6 [5]). Following the dependence of the
binding energy on the last level on C6 (ﬁg. 7b) we see
that for smaller values of C6 this level approaches the
asymptote, which makes an accurate determination of
the scattering length more diﬃcult.

study by Fourier transform spectroscopy were enriched
by adding 56 transition frequencies from ground state
levels with v′′ up to 38. This gave us an opportunity to
reanalyze the existing description of the long range part
of the PEC from Ref. [1].

By assuming the long range expansion (3) for the po-
tential energy curve to be valid already from 9.4 ˚A, the
probability distributions of the dissociation energy and
the dispersion coeﬃcients were derived from Monte Carlo
analysis. Their mean values and uncertainties are given
in Table III. We showed, that due to the large amount
of experimental data, the long range analysis is almost
independent of the model functions used to describe the
inner part of the PEC.

The reliability of the experimental potential for de-
scribing collisions between two Ca atoms at low temper-
atures was checked by calculating the s-wave scattering
length and the position of the last bound level with re-
spect to the asymptote for the variety of long range ex-
tensions of the potential allowed by the present experi-
mental data. Following the distribution of the long range
parameters, the binding energy of the last level was found
to vary between several 10 kHz and several MHz. This
conﬁrmed our anticipations [1] for a large and positive
scattering length, 250a0 < a < 1000a0. Contrary to
the previous study, the present determination is purely
experimental and does not rely on the theoretical esti-
mations for C6. Moreover, the diﬀerence in the values of
C6 from Ref. [5] and from this study exceeds the stated
uncertainties, although a small model dependence is still
existing by altering the connecting point between the in-
ner potential and the long range branch (compare ﬁg. 6).
The Monte Carlo simulations open new perspectives
for analyzing the uncertainties of the parameters of the
PEC. They could be used also to determine the kind of
spectroscopic data and their required accuracy for achiev-
ing the desired uncertainty of the ﬁtted parameters. For
example, we checked that including a vibrational pro-
gression up to v′′ = 39 with the present experimental
accuracy will not reduce the uncertainties of C6 and D0
signiﬁcantly. This could be reached, however, even with
the present distribution of data, provided the accuracy
can be improved. Therefore, we believe that only high
resolution Doppler free spectroscopic techniques should
be used for further improvement on the Ca2 ground state
PEC, especially at long internuclear distances.

V. CONCLUSIONS

nique. The spectroscopic data obtained in our previous

Abstract

We calculate exactly the modes of motion of the Time-averaged Orbiting
Potential (TOP) trap with its four degrees of freedom, namely the three
translations and the spin, taken into account. We ﬁnd that, when gravity
is neglected, there are two parameters in the problem namely, the angular
velocity of the rotating ﬁeld and its strength. We present the stability di-
agram in these parameters. We ﬁnd the mode frequencies calculated from
the time-averaged potential model used by the inventors of the TOP is an
excellent approximation to our exact results. However, for other parameters,
this may not be the case.

1 Introduction.

The ﬁrst observation of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) [1] was done in
the so-called Time-averaged Orbiting Potential (TOP) trap. Although later
other magnetic traps, optical plug, and even an all-optical one[2] were used,
the ingenious TOP trap continues to be a workhorse in the trade[3] because
of its unique advantage as pointed out by [4]. It seemed to us thus worthwhile
to extend the analysis given in Ref.[4], which is based on the concept of a
time-averaged adiabatic potential, by studying the exact motion of all the
degrees of freedom in the problem, namely the three translational degrees
of freedom and the spin degree of freedom of the particle[5]. This has the
advantage of allowing the calculation of limitations required by stability.
We ﬁnd that, when gravity g is neglected, there are two parameters in the
problem, the angular velocity of the rotating ﬁeld Ω and its strength α, and
we present the stability diagram in the α-Ω plane. The parameters reported
in Ref.[4] are shown to be well inside the stable region. Their calculated
frequencies agree excellently with our exact frequencies for their experiment.
When the limit of high ﬁeld strength is taken, our analytic results reduce to
their formulae. The stability diagram that we found shows that the TOP
trap is very ﬂexible for the experimentalist in terms of allowed parameters α
and Ω. Our treatment is classical, but we also discuss what is involved in a
quantum-mechanical calculation.

The structure of this paper is as follows:

In Sec.2 we ﬁrst deﬁne the
problem, write down the equations of motion and ﬁnd stationary solutions
of these equations. Next, we perturb the stationary solutions, linearize the
equations of motion and derive the secular equation which determines the
frequencies of the various possible modes. The secular equation is given as a
function of α, Ω and g. In Sec.3 we use the secular equation to ﬁnd the mode
frequencies for the TOP trap described in Ref.[4], and compare our exact
results with their calculations and measurements. In Sec.4 we specify to the
case g = 0 and derive approximate expressions for the mode frequencies in
the limit where α is large, starting from the secular equation. These are
found to agree with the corresponding expressions given in Ref.[4].
In Sec.5
we present the stability region in the α-Ω plane (for g = 0) for which stable
trapping occurs, and comment on its implications and limitations. Finally,
in Sec.7 we summarize our results and discuss brieﬂy the related quantum-
mechanical problem.

Eqs.(5) are almost the equations of motion of the particle in a coordinate

of the angle ϕ, which is measured with respect to the ﬁxed ˆx axis rather than
with respect to the axis deﬁned by the rotating ﬁeld. To show this we rewrite

2.2 The stationary solutions and their stability.

We seek a solution in which the particle moves synchronously with the ﬁeld
at a constant radius and height. Setting

ϕ = ϕ0 + Ωτ ; r(τ ) = r0 ; z(τ ) = z0

in Eqs.(10) we ﬁnd two possible solutions, given by

It can be easily shown that the stationary solution corresponding to ϕ0 =
1800 has its magnetic moment antiparallel to the direction of the local mag-
netic ﬁeld, whereas for the ϕ0 = 00 solution it is parallel to the direction of
the ﬁeld. From Eq.(12) we also conclude that for a stationary solution to
exist,
must be smaller than 1. This is simply a consequence of the fact
that, in our model, the magnetic ﬁeld cannot apply a force greater than µH ′
in the +z-direction. When the weight of the particle mG is greater than
µH ′, the magnetic force cannot balance the weight of the particle. The lat-
ter then accelerates in the axial direction, and no stationary solution exists.
Note also that the particle is located above the origin with its spin pointing

inward, even in the absence of gravity [6]. This is necessary in order to have
a z-component of the ﬁeld. The latter exerts torque on the spin that causes
it to rotate synchronously with the ﬁeld.

To check the stability of the solutions found, we add ﬁrst-order pertur-

bations. We set

In deriving these equations we used the constraint

ˆn

since ˆn is, by deﬁnition, a unit vector. We have also discarded in Eqs.(14)
the equation corresponding to the last equation in Eqs.(10) as it turned out
to be identical to the fourth.

Looking back at Eqs.(14) we note that the two possible solutions diﬀer by
the sign of α (reversal of the direction of the rotating ﬁeld). It is therefore
suﬃces to concentrate on the solution with ϕ0 = 1800 for example, and to
study both positive and negative values of α. This is what we do in the
following.

To look for oscillatory (stable) solutions for Eqs.(14) we set

δr = (δr)0 e−iωt
δϕ = (δϕ)0 e−iωt
δz = (δz)0 e−iωt

determines the eigenfrequencies ω of the various possible modes.

At this point we pause and prove that the solution with ϕ0 = 00 is not
stable for any combination of α, Ω and g: We consider the fourth order
polynomial Eq.(17) as a polynomial in x = ω2. We note that when x = 0,
0 which is positive when
the polynomial takes on the value A0 =
α is negative. When x
on the other hand, it takes on a value which
is asymptotic to A4x4 =
0x4 which, for suﬃciently large (negative)
x, gives a negative value. Thus, at least one root x = ω2 of the polynomial
must be negative, corresponding to two purely imaginary frequencies with
opposite signs, and hence to an unstable solution.

Solving for the four roots ω of the characteristic polynomial Eq.(17) and
multiplying the ω’s by Ω0/2π gives the frequencies: 7.38MHz, 7.524441522KHz,
7.475558498KHz and 67.99Hz. The highest frequency 7.38MHz corre-

the value µHs/2πS where Hs is the strength of the local magnetic ﬁeld at
the stationary point. As was calculated above, Hs is roughly equal to the
7.5KHz
strength of the rotating ﬁeld H. The two middle frequencies
turn out to be very close to the frequency of rotation of the ﬁeld 7.5KHz.
The reason that we keep so many digits in these frequencies will be clar-
iﬁed shortly. Calculation of the eigenvectors for these two modes yields
(δr)0 / (δz)0 ∼
1 for both, which shows that their coupling to
the axial coordinate is small, indicating that these are the two lateral vi-
brational modes. Recall that the frequencies that are found here correspond

to the rotating frame. To ﬁnd the frequencies in the laboratory frame we
explicitly calculate the time dependence of the lateral coordinates: The x
coordinate for example, is given by x (τ ) = (r0 + δr) cos [1800 + Ωτ + δϕ]
where δr = (δr)0 cos (ωτ ), δϕ = (δϕ)0 cos (ωτ + φ0) and φ0 is a phase which
is determined by the eigenvectors. Expansion of x (τ ) to ﬁrst order in the
perturbations shows that it contains a term proportional to the product
cos [1800 + Ωτ + δϕ] cos (ωτ + φ0) which contains a term with slow frequency
Ω and another term with fast frequency ω + Ω with the same amplitude.
ω
We thus ﬁnd that, in the laboratory frame, the frequencies of the axial vi-
brational modes are given by subtracting and adding the rotation frequency
from the middle frequencies found by using Eq.(17).This gives the two slow
lateral frequencies +24.441522Hz and
24.441502Hz, and the fast lateral
−
frequencies 15.0244KHz and 14.9756KHz. The eigenvector for the lowest
frequency 67.99Hz satisfy (δr)0 / (δz)0 ∼
1, which is a clear indi-
cation that this is the axial vibrational mode. In this case, the frequency of
vibration is the same both for the rotating frame and the laboratory frame
so no subtraction/addition of Ω is needed.

Table I compares our results to the measured and calculated results re-
ported in [4]. We conclude that the Time-averaged Orbiting Potential (TOP)
approximation is indeed a very good approximation to the exact result ob-
tained here. Note however, that the two fast lateral frequencies ω + Ω that
our analysis yield, were not reported in Ref.[4], possibly because they were
not looked for.

Note also that in the time-averaged orbiting potential approximation,
the resulting potential is necessarily isotropic in the lateral plane. Hence,
in this approximation there is only one lateral vibrational frequency. The
exact analysis presented here, on the other hand, gives naturally two fre-
quencies, corresponding to the two slow lateral vibrational modes, and two
more frequencies, corresponding to the fast lateral modes. For the TOP trap
parameters given above we ﬁnd the slow frequencies to be very nearly equal,
up to the seventh signiﬁcant digit. The splitting is a consequence of the fact
that the clock-wise lateral vibrational mode is not equivalent to the counter
clock-wise lateral vibrational mode since in both cases the spin precesses
in the same direction. This splitting may be large for other choice for the
parameters.

For the numerical example of the previous section we have found that g

[7, 8], and it is therefore natural to ﬁnd approximate expressions for the
mode frequencies under these limits. We expect that for these values, the
four frequencies will be as follows: A very high frequency ωp corresponding to
the precession, two very close middle frequencies ωxy which are almost equal
to Ω and correspond to the lateral vibrations, and a very low frequency ωz
corresponding to the axial vibrations. The large dynamic range spanned
by these frequencies suggests that there is a certain relation between the
coeﬃcients of the polynomial in the secular equation Eq.(17). We exploit this
relation in order to ﬁnd approximate expressions for the mode frequencies:
We ﬁrst construct a fourth-order polynomial in ω2, whose roots ω2

ω2
z , expand it in powers of ω2, and keep

5 The stability region for g = 0.

Having analyzed the TOP trap for the limit α
1, we turn our attention to
study the region α, Ω
1, which has not yet been exploited experimentally.
To keep matters simple, we specify to the gravitation-free case g = 0. We
use Eq.(17) to scan the α-Ω plane in the search of points corresponding to
stable solutions. The result is shown in Fig.(8).

This ﬁgure shows the boundary lines between points corresponding to sta-
ble regions and unstable regions. The fact that these lines consist of diﬀerent
segments, indicate that two diﬀerent segments of a given line correspond to
diﬀerent modes that become unstable. For example, going upward along
the α = 2.5 line, we ﬁnd that the two slowest modes coalesce and become
0.73. As Ω is increased, these modes become stable again

Ω10α we conclude that points, both along the Ω = 0 line and
along the α = 0 line, have one mode with vanishing frequency, corresponding
to a soft mode. In addition, all points in the α < 0 half-plane correspond
to unstable solutions, as was proved earlier. Note also that the coeﬃcients
in the secular equation really depend on Ω2 and not just on Ω. Hence, the
continuation of the stability diagram to the Ω < 0 half-plane is simply a
mirror reﬂection of the Ω > 0 half-plane with respect to the Ω = 0 line.

The stability diagram shows that the TOP trap is much more tolerant
that what one would have expected. There are many points near the cor-
ner of the ﬁrst quadrant of the α-Ω plane that may be used experimentally.

6 Connection with the adiabatic approxima-

tion.

It is instructive to study the same problem in the limit where the system is
extremely adiabatic. For simplicity we specify to the case G = 0. In this
approximation, the direction of the spin ˆn is locked to the direction of the
local magnetic ﬁeld, so that

7 Discussion

We have shown that our exact analytic results reduce to the formulae derived
via the time-averaged orbiting potential approximation, in the case where α
is large. In addition, the stability diagram that we found, suggests that the
TOP trap is very ﬂexible for the experimentalist in terms of the allowed
parameters. We have also shown that under the adiabatic approximation,
where the direction of the spin ˆn is locked to the direction of the ﬁeld in
the rotating frame, we recover, for large magnetic ﬁeld α, the exact mode
frequencies.

It is interesting to note that Eqs.(7) and (8) pave the way for a quantum-
mechanical treatment of the same problem in the comoving frame. When
gravity is neglected, the Hamiltonian for this system is given by

more resonable to study it for the case S = 1. We believe that despite the
complexity that the Coriolis and centrifugal forces add to the problem, it
is possible to solve TOP trap quantum-mechanically. The analysis of this
problem is still under study.

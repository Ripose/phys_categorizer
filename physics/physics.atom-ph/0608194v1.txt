We perform precision microwave spectroscopy—aided by Stark deceleration—to reveal the low
magnetic ﬁeld behavior of OH in its 2Π3/2 ro-vibronic ground state, identifying two ﬁeld-insensitive
hyperﬁne transitions suitable as qubits and determining a diﬀerential Land´e g-factor of 1.267(5) ×
10−3 between opposite parity components of the Λ-doublet. The data are successfully modeled
with an eﬀective hyperﬁne Zeeman Hamiltonian, which we use to make a tenfold improvement of
the magnetically sensitive, astrophysically important ∆F = ±1 satellite-line frequencies, yielding
1 720 529 887(10) Hz and 1 612 230 825(15) Hz.

Scientiﬁc advances such as creating new forms of dipo-
lar matter, realizing molecular scalable quantum com-
putation, and uncovering physics beyond the Standard
Model demand improved understanding of even the most
familiar of polar molecules. Techniques such as buﬀer
gas cooling [1], photoassociation [2], and Stark decelera-
tion [3, 4], are beginning to yield cold samples of ground
state polar molecules, such as OH, that can be utilized
for these endeavors. However, so far no technique simul-
taneously achieves the large molecule number and ultra-
cold, <100 µK, temperature required. Solving this prob-
lem would be exciting not only for the accompanying
ability to study ultracold collisions and collective phe-
nomena dominated by long-range dipole-dipole interac-
tions [5], but also for the prospect of using the strong
dipolar interaction to robustly implement quantum logic
gates [6, 7]. This would obviate the need for the pre-
cise, dynamical position control or the short-lived excited
states that encumber other proposed quantum computa-
tion systems [6].

Stark deceleration currently provides relatively large
numbers of polar molecules, but at temperatures limited
to a few mK. Additional cooling will be required if we
hope to reach densities necessary for exploring ultracold
dipolar gas phenomena. Magnetic trapping is a promis-
ing aid for cooling because it provides long term conﬁne-
ment of relatively hot particles while also admitting elec-
tric (E) ﬁelds to the trapped molecules. This latter point
is important since B- and E-ﬁelds can modify collisional
processes in ways that enhance the eﬃciency of sympa-
thetic cooling with co-trapped alkalis. Once cooled, E-
ﬁelds can tune the dipole interaction to explore collective
phenomena such as ﬁeld-linked states [5]. To achieve
these goals, we need to understand precisely the inﬂu-
ence of B-ﬁelds on collisional resonances in the cold and
ultracold regimes, and experimental data are required to
validate theory models of polar molecular states in low
B-ﬁelds. Additionally, because ﬂuctuating B-ﬁelds are
a nuisance for long-term qubit coherence and precision
measurements, accurate models are required to account

for and nullify these unwanted eﬀects. The natural com-
bination of precision microwave spectroscopy with the
cold, monoenergetic packets from Stark decelerators [8]
enables us to understand polar molecule hyperﬁne Zee-
man behavior, as presented in this Letter.

As a demonstration of this technique, we experimen-
tally verify our reﬁnement of previous OH Zeeman the-
ory [9, 10] to the hyperﬁne regime and use it to identify
two candidate qubit transitions that are robust against
B-ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. Moreover, we apply this model to
the precision measurement of the magnetically sensitive
OH ground state satellite-lines, completing the ten-fold

physically important J = 3/2 Λ-doublet [8]. These
measurements highlight the ability of the Stark decel-
erator not only to enhance our understanding of unex-
plored regimes of molecular coupling, but also to con-
tribute toward searches of non-Standard Model physics,
e.g. the variation of fundamental constants such as ﬁne-
structure, α, and the electron-proton mass ratio, y, which
may be measured by comparing Earth-bound OH with
that found in OH megamasers [11, 12]. These dis-
tant sources are spatially well-deﬁned, and by combin-
ing our recent measurements with astrophysical studies
of comparable resolution, we will be able to constrain—
with spatial dependence—ﬁne-structure variation below
1 ppm for ∆α/α over 6.5 G yr [13]. We further note that
the low-ﬁeld behavior revealed in OH may also occur in
other molecules and certainly in those with 2Π structure.
Methods presented here are crucial if B-ﬁeld eﬀects are
to be enhanced for molecular cooling schemes or miti-
gated in molecular-based clocks, qubits [6, 7], and preci-
sion measurements of the electron electric dipole moment
in molecules [14].

·

The hyperﬁne Zeeman structure of OH is subtly per-
turbed by angular momentum couplings of higher order
S spin-orbit interac-
than the well-known, diagonal L
tion, and this study reveals their eﬀect on OH tran-
sition frequencies in low B-ﬁeld. These perturbations
cause the parity states, labeled f and e, of the 2Π3/2 ro-
vibronic ground state—which are otherwise identical—to
possess slightly diﬀerent hyperﬁne energy splittings and
g-factors. Figure 1(a) sketches the relevant energy lev-
els and the higher-order angular momentum couplings
between them. The two 2Π ﬁne-structure manifolds are
mixed with the ﬁrst electronically excited state, 2Σ1/2,
via J
S couplings. Mediated
by these couplings, the spin-rotation induced splitting of
the ρ-doubled 2Σ1/2 state causes the 2Π states to also
split. The resulting Λ-doublet energy splitting, ∆Λ, be-
tween parity states is smaller in 2Π3/2 due to the weaker,
oﬀ-diagonal L
S coupling. The hyperﬁne parity diﬀer-
ence may be ascribed to the minute diﬀerence in coupling
strength between 2Σ1/2 and the energetically separated
parity states. Likewise, the larger f -state g-factor is due
to the stronger J
S coupling between the energetically
closer 2Π f -parity states [15].

Experimentally, we focus on the electric dipole allowed,

Λ-doublet parity states, as shown by arrows in Fig. 1(b).
We write these states in the
basis and distin-
guish π-transitions from states by substituting ∆p for
the parity value, p. The hyperﬁne energies of the parity
states are written as Γf,e = ¯Γ
ξ/2, where the average
splitting, ¯Γ, and diﬀerence, ξ, are approximately 54.1 and
1.96 MHz, respectively [16]. Similarly, the g-factors are
written gf,e = ¯g

δg/2, where δg is 0.3% of ¯g [10].

of the ground state precluded low-ﬁeld measurements.
While these subtle diﬀerences can be neglected in pre-
vious experiments wherein huge magnetic ﬁelds cause
the Zeeman energies to be much larger than the hy-
perﬁne splittings, we demonstrate that—in this new era
of high-resolution molecular spectroscopy—these eﬀects
cannot be ignored when low-ﬁelds are present. In other
words, in ﬁelds of 1 T, where J is a good quantum num-
ber, Λ-doublet transition frequency diﬀerences vary as
expected—linearly with applied B-ﬁeld [10]. However, in
ﬁelds <30 G, where F = J
1/2 is a good quantum
number, we do not ﬁnd a linear variation of transition
frequency with B-ﬁeld. We instead observe a linear fre-
quency shift out to
1 G, and thereafter detect shifts
that are signiﬁcantly varied in curvature versus B-ﬁeld,
as shown in the data of Fig. 2 for B < 8 G.

±

∼

Qualitatively, this eﬀect may be understood as a diﬀer-
ential onset of the Paschen-Back eﬀect in the two parity
states, which we explicate by ﬁrst considering the hypo-
thetical case in which no diﬀerences exist between either
the g-factors (δg = 0) or the hyperﬁne splittings (ξ = 0).
As such, the parity states are identical with respect to
an applied B-ﬁeld, and one would expect no frequency
shifts in the hyperﬁne Zeeman transitions of, e.g., the π-
transitions between main-lines (∆F = 0) versus B-ﬁeld
until B
1 T. This holds in spite of quadratic level shifts
induced by mixing between F = 2 and F = 1 at B > 30
G, as described by the Paschen-Back eﬀect, since this on-
set occurs at exactly the same B-ﬁeld for p = f, e. If we
now account for δg
= 0, then a linear variation of the hy-
perﬁne Zeeman transitions appears and is proportional to
mF δg at low ﬁelds. Finally adding the hyperﬁne pertur-
bation induces an interesting dynamic in the frequency
diﬀerences. The onset of the Paschen-Back eﬀect now
occurs at slightly diﬀerent B-ﬁelds for the parity states,
causing the otherwise linear diﬀerential frequency shifts

To investigate this more rigorously, we employ an eﬀec-
tive Hamiltonian [15] to systematically distill the full—
though intractable—system Hamiltonian into one that
focuses solely on the state of interest, 2Π3/2. The re-
sulting Zeeman Hamilitonian is expanded into the hy-
perﬁne basis, and the hyperﬁne energy and g-factor dif-
ferences are incorporated parametrically, a point of de-
parture from previous treatments [9, 15]. The resulting
hyperﬁne Hamiltonian is applicable to higher-rotational
states (J

3/2) as well as to the 2Π1/2 manifold [19]:

ity Hamiltonians for each value of mF , and upon di-
agonalization yields 16 energy eigenvalues for the four
J = 3/2 hyperﬁne states. The oﬀ-diagonal terms vanish
for

to F = 1, and the diagonal Zeeman terms vanish for the
linearly insensitive mF = 0 states. Eigenvalue diﬀerences
correspond to transition energies as a function of B-ﬁeld.

Typical operation produces a 106 cm−3 dense packet with
mean velocity controllable from 410 m/s down to nearly
rest and a minimum temperature of 5 mK [4]. We choose
to run the decelerator at 200 m/s as a compromise be-
tween slowing eﬃciency, microwave power, and interro-
gation time [8]. We perform Rabi spectroscopy by in-
terrogating the OH packet with one or more microwave
pulses referenced to the Cs standard [8]. Laser-induced
ﬂuorescence provides state detection by exciting the f
manifold—equally driving the two hyperﬁne states—with
282 nm light and registering a fraction of the subsequent
313 nm emission with a photomultiplier tube. Main and
satellite transitions originating from

with a single microwave pulse and detected by registering
a reduction in photon counts (see Fig 1(b)).

Their relative peak heights and frequency shifts versus
cavity position also provide a tool for mapping E-ﬁeld
direction and power inhomogeneities. When combined
with the
data, this mapping provides a mea-
surement of the B-ﬁeld inhomogeneity as well. We per-
form B-ﬁeld calibration and corresponding Zeeman shift
measurements over several portions of the cavity. This
reduces systematic errors, and we conclude that our B-
ﬁeld calibration and inhomogeneity mapping are accurate
to within less than 1%. Other systematic shifts, such
as from collisions, stray electric ﬁeld, doppler shift, and
black body radiation, are collectively <3 Hz [8].

the line frequencies is estimated to be <0.6 Hz. The ﬁt
value for the B-ﬁeld calibration is consistent with that ob-
tained earlier, albeit with a larger uncertainty. We choose
to use the ﬁt-value’s error to obtain a conservative esti-
mate of the transition measurement’s uncertainty. The

Variation of α may be constrained by taking the sum
and diﬀerence of either the main- or satellite-lines. The
diﬀerence is sensitive to α while the sum measures the
red-shift systematic. The satellite-lines oﬀer a 55-fold in-
crease in resolution over the main-lines due to the 2¯Γ
versus ξ separation [11]. Now that the complete Λ-
doublet is measured with high-precision, one can simulta-
neously constrain variation of α and y [12]. All four lines
must be detected from the same source, and the closure
criterion, i.e., the zero diﬀerence of the averages of the
main- and satellite-line frequencies, provides a critical
systematics check. We obtain an Earth-bound closure
of 44
21 Hz. Imminent astrophysical measurements of
the satellite-lines below the 100 Hz level [18] highlight
the prescience of our study for observing the variation of
fundamental constants.

angular momentum operators and their quantum numbers are discussed.

The eigenfunctions of the total angular momenta are calculated for both
odd D and even D cases. The radial equations for a spherically symmetric
system are derived. The exact solutions for the system with a Coulomb

potential are obtained analytically. The energy levels and the corresponding

ﬁne structure are also presented.

I. INTRODUCTION

The exact solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation in the real three-dimensional space
for a hydrogen atom and for a harmonic oscillator were important technical achievements
in quantum mechanics [1,2]. During the past half century, the mathematical tools for
the orbital angular momentum operators and their eigenfunctions in an arbitrary D-
dimensional space have been presented [3,4,5,6,7,8]. The nonrelativistic D-dimensional
Coulombic and the harmonic oscillator problems have been studied in some detail by
many authors [9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. The solutions of the Dirac equation, however, have
been studied in the usual three- [17,18,19,20,21], two- [22] and one-dimensional [23] space.
Motivated by the recent interest of higher-dimensional ﬁeld theory , we generalize the
Dirac equation to D+1 space-time. The conserved total angular momentum operators and

their quantum numbers are discussed. The eigenfunctions of the total angular momenta
are calculated for both odd D and even D cases. From the viewpoint of mathematics, this
problem is a typical application of group theory to physics. In terms of the eigenfunctions,
we obtain the radial equations for the spherically symmetric system, and analytically solve
the radial equations for the quantum Coulombic system.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the generalization of the
Dirac equation to D + 1 space-time. In Sec. 3, the conserved angular momentum oper-
ators and their quantum numbers are discussed. The eigenfunctions of the total angular
momentums are calculated for both odd D and even D cases in terms of the method of
group theory. The radial equations for the system with a spherically symmetric potential
are derived. In Sec. 4, the wave functions of bound states for a Coulombic system, which
are expressed by the conﬂuent hypergeometric functions, are presented. The energy levels
and the corresponding ﬁne structure are also discussed. Some conclusions are given in
Sec. 5.

where M is the mass of the particle, and (D+1) matrices γµ satisfy the anti-

commutative relations:

III. THE RADIAL EQUATIONS

Since the potential V (r) is spherically symmetric, the symmetry group of the system
is SO(D) group. Erdelyi [3] and Louck [5,7] introduced the hyperspherical coordinates in
the real D-dimensional space

x1 = r cos θ1 sin θ2 . . . sin θD−1,
x2 = r sin θ1 sin θ2 . . . sin θD−1,

Now, let us sketch some necessary knowledge of the SO(D) group. From the represen-
tation theory of Lie groups [25,26,27], the Lie algebras of the SO(2N+1) group and the
SO(2N) group are BN and DN , respectively. Their Chevalley bases with the subscript µ,
1

If the eigenstates

for a given weight m are degenerate, this weight is called a

the lowering ones. For an irreducible representation, there is a highest weight M, which
is a simple weight and can be used to describe the irreducible representation. Usually,
the irreducible representation is also called the highest weight representation and directly
denoted by M. The Casimir C2(M) can be calculated by the formula (e.g. see (1.131) in
[27])

The spinor wave functions as well as those for the total angular momentum are diﬀerent
for D = 2N +1 and D = 2N, and will be discussed separately in the following subsections.

From the Sturm-Liouville theorem [29], there are bound states with the energy less
than and near M for the attractive Coulomb potential and with the energy larger than and
M for the repulsive potential, if the interaction is not too strong. It is convenient
near
to introduce a dimensionless variable ρ in Eq. (35) for bound states:

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we generalized the Dirac equation to (D+1)-dimensional space-time. The
conserved angular momentum operators and their quantum numbers are discussed. The
eigenfunctions of the total angular momentums are calculated for both odd D and even
D cases, respectively. The uniﬁed radial equations for a spherically symmetric system are
obtained. The radial equations with a Coulomb potential are solved by the power series
expansion approach. The exact solutions are expressed by the conﬂuent hypergeometric
functions. The eigenvalues as well as their ﬁne structure energy are also studied. Our
solutions coincide with those in 3+1 dimensional [21] and 2+1 dimensional [22] space-time.

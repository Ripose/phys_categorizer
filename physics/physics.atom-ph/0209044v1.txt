Annihilation cross-section of ultra low-energy atomic antihydrogen (E ≤ 10

−5 a.u.) on atomic
hydrogen are calculated within a quantum mechanical coupled channels approach. The results diﬀer
from the extrapolations of semiclassical models to low energies. The main features of the observables
are found to be determined by a family of H ¯H nearthreshold metastable states.

I. INTRODUCTION

The projects of synthesis and spectroscopy of ultracold atomic antihydrogen in traps [1] require theoretical calcula-
tions of the low energy matter-antimatter inelastic collisions rates. We present here a quantum mechanical model of
P n∗ + e−e+)
atomic antihydrogen (H) and atomic hydrogen (H) interaction, describing inelastic collisions (H + H
at energies less than 10−5a.u.

→

We developed a unitary coupled channel model which incorporates the main physical inputs. Our results for the
annihilation cross-section will be compared to those provided by the semiclassical methods [2,3,4]. We will show that
in our approach the low energy properties are determined by a rich spectrum of nearthreshold S-matrix singularities
generated by long range van der Waals potential.

We develope the eﬀective potential approach to the low energy rearrangement collisions, used by the authors for
H ¯p scattering [5]. The details of the formalism would be published elsewhere, here we give only very brief description.

The wave-function is represented as a sum of two components:

III. RESULTS

The H ¯H scattering length is found to be aHH = (6.1

i2.7) a.u. It was found to be an oscillating function of reduced
mass of H ¯H thought of as a free parameter (see Fig.1.) The immediate consequence of such a behavior of the scattering
length is a strong isotope eﬀect. In particular, the DH scattering length was found to be aDH = (15.0
i11.6) a.u.
The annihilation cross-sections for H ¯H and D ¯H systems are presented on Fig.2. It should be mentioned that the
semiclassical models show no sign of oscillating behavior of observables. The extrapolated to low energies values of
semiclassical cross-sections depend on velocity v like (1/v)2/3 in contradiction with quantum mechanical 1/v-law and
signiﬁcantly smaller than the calculated quantum cross-section.

An oscillating behavior of scattering length as a function of reduced mass is explained by existence of nearthreshold
quasibound states [6], generated by van der Waals long range attraction. Appearance of the new nearthreshold states
with increasing of the reduced mass of the system results in a strong enhancement of annihilation cross-section. The
energies, inelastic widths and mean radius of several such states are shown in Table I.

Taking in mind, that main properties of observables are governed by

C6/R6 tail of local potential, while the short
range interaction, including eﬀective potential, only modiﬁes the spectrum of the nearthreshold states, we can get the
analytical expression for the H ¯H scattering length:

where C6 is van der Waals constant, r0 is the range of short range interaction (r0

(so called black sphere limit) the scattering length becomes smooth function of reduced mass M and van der Waals

Our numerical calculations show that we are far from the black sphere limit, and the scattering length is indeed an
oscillating function of M and C6. We have also ﬁnd it to be very sensitive to short range interaction details. In
particular, taking into account the nuclear potential, which describes the nuclear absorption, signiﬁcantly changes the
value of scattering length from aHH = 5.2

i1.8 a.u. to its ﬁnal value of aHH = (6.1

IV. CONCLUSION

A coupled channels model describing the HH system at energies less than 10−5 a.u. has been developed. The
results thus obtained for annihilation cross-section substantially diﬀer from the low energy extrapolations of the black
sphere model and other classical or semiclassical approaches.

The reaction dynamics is found to be determined by the existence of several nearthreshold states. Such states are
produced by van der Waals potential and have inelastic widths due to the coupling with Protonium formation channels.
We predict strong isotope eﬀect in H ¯H and D ¯H scattering. Our results seem to be in a qualitative agreement with
recently published results [7] by P. Froelich et al.

We show that the conductance of atoms through a tightly
conﬁning waveguide constriction is quantized in units of
λ2
dB/π, where λdB is the de Broglie wavelength of the inci-
dent atoms. Such a constriction forms the atom analogue of
an electron quantum point contact and is an example of quan-
tum transport of neutral atoms in an aperiodic system. We
present a practical constriction geometry that can be realized
using a microfabricated magnetic waveguide, and discuss how
a pair of such constrictions can be used to study the quantum
statistics of weakly interacting gases in small traps.

Quantum transport, in which the center-of-mass mo-
tion of particles is dominated by quantum mechanical
eﬀects, has been observed in both electron and neutral-
atom systems. Pioneering experiments demonstrated
quantum transport in periodic structures. For exam-
ple, Bloch oscillations and Wannier-Stark ladders were
observed in the conduction of electrons through super-
lattices [1] with an applied electric ﬁeld, as well as in
the transport of neutral atoms through accelerating op-
tical lattices [2,3]. Further work with neutral atoms in
optical lattices has utilized their slower time scales (kHz
instead of THz) and longer coherence lengths to observe a
clear signature of dynamical Bloch band suppression [4],
an eﬀect originally predicted for but not yet observed in
electron transport [5].

Quantum transport also occurs in aperiodic systems.
For example, a quantum point contact (QPC) is a single
constriction through which the conductance is always an
integer multiple of some base conductance. The quan-
tization of electron conductance in multiples of 2e2/h,
where e is the charge of the electron and h is Planck’s
constant, is observed through channels whose width is
comparable to the Fermi wavelength λF . Experimen-
tal realizations of a QPC include a sharp metallic tip
contacting a surface [6] and an electrostatic constriction
in a two-dimensional electron gas [7,8]. Electron QPC’s
have length-to-width ratios less than 10 because phase-
coherent transport requires that channels must be shorter
than the mean free path between scattering events, ℓmfp.
Geometric constraints are the limiting factor in the ac-
curacy of quantization in an electron QPC [9].

In this Letter, we present an experimentally realizable
system that forms a QPC for neutral atoms — a con-
striction whose ground state width bo is comparable to
λdB/2π, where λdB is the de Broglie wavelength of the

atoms. The “conductance”, as deﬁned below, through
a QPC for atoms is quantized in integer multiples of
λ2
dB/π. The absence of frozen-in disorder, the low rate

This new regime is interesting because deleterious eﬀects
such as reﬂection and inter-mode nonadiabatic transi-
tions are minimized [12], allowing for accuracy of conduc-
tance quantization limited only by ﬁnite-temperature ef-
fects. Furthermore, the observation of conductance quan-
tization at new energy and length scales is of inherent
interest.

If a QPC for neutral atoms were realized, it would
provide excellent opportunities for exploring the physics
of small ensembles of weakly interacting gases. For in-
stance, the transmission through a series of two QPC’s
would depend on the energetics of atoms conﬁned in the
trap between the two constrictions. The physics of such
a “quantum dot” for atoms is fundamentally diﬀerent
from that of electrons, since the Coulombic charging en-
ergy that dominates the energetics of an electron quan-
tum dot [13] is absent for neutral particles. The quan-
tum statistics of neutral atoms energetically restricted to
sub-dimensional spaces has already aroused theoretical
interest in novel eﬀects such as Fermionization [14] and
the formation of a Luttinger liquid [15].

Recently,

several waveguides have been proposed
[16–18] whose conﬁnement may be strong enough to meet
the constraint bo . λdB/2π for longitudinally free atoms.
In this work, we will focus on the example of a surface-
mounted four-wire electromagnet waveguide for atoms
[18] (see Fig. 1) which exploits recent advances in micro-
fabricated atom optics [19,20]. A neutral atom with a
magnetic quantum number m experiences a linear Zee-
B(r)
man potential U (r) = µBgm
, where µB is the
|
|
Bohr magneton, g is the Land´e g factor, and B(r) is
the magnetic ﬁeld at r. Atoms with m > 0 are trans-
versely conﬁned near the minimum in ﬁeld magnitude
shown in Fig. 1; however, they are free to move in the
z direction, parallel to the wires. Non-adiabatic changes
in m near the ﬁeld minimum can be exponentially sup-
pressed with a holding ﬁeld Bh applied in the axial di-
rection z [21]. Near the guide center, the potential
forms a cylindrically symmetric two-dimensional simple
harmonic oscillator with classical oscillation frequency

A constriction in the waveguide potential can be cre-
ated by contracting the spacing between the wires of the
waveguide. The constriction strength can be tuned dy-
namically by changing the current in the wires. Fig. 2a

ing S(z) is smoothly varied as

where So is the spacing at z = 0, and ℓ is the character-
istic channel length. Assuming the wires are nearly par-
allel, the guide width, depth, oscillation frequency, and
curvature scale as S(z), S(z)−1, S(z)−2, and S(z)−4, re-
spectively. For ℓ = 100So, ﬁeld calculations above this
curved-wire geometry show that the parallel-wire approx-
. 3ℓ, allowing for a well-deﬁned
imation is valid for
waveguide potential over a factor of more than 103 in
level spacing (see Fig. 2b). Our particular choice of S(z)
is somewhat arbitrary but prescribes one way in which
wires can form a smooth, constricting waveguide as well
as run to contact pads (necessary to connect the wires to
a power supply) far enough from the channel (
ℓ) that
their geometry is unimportant. The total “footprint” of
this device (not including contact pads) is approximately
10ℓ, or about 1 mm2, for So = 1 µm and ℓ = 100So.

Atoms approach the constriction from the −z direc-
tion, as shown in Fig. 2a. We calculate the propagation
of the atom waves through the constriction by solving the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation in three spatial di-
mensions. It is important to note that the nature of quan-
tum transport requires fully quantum-mechanical calcu-
lations, even for the longitudinal degree of freedom within
the waveguide. The Hamiltonian for an atom near the
axis of the four-wire waveguide described by Eq. (1) is

where ˆ denotes an operator, ωo is the transverse oscil-
lation frequency at z = 0, and we have assumed the
parallel-wire scaling of ﬁeld curvature, S(z)−4. Since
a direct numerical integration approach is computation-
ally prohibitive, we developed a model that neglects
non-adiabatic propagation at the entrance and exit of
the channel. The waveguide potential is truncated at

±

z =
zT , the planes between which atoms can propa-
gate adiabatically in the waveguide, and the wavefunc-
tion amplitude ψ and its normal derivative ∂ψ/∂z are
matched between plane-wave states (
> zT ) and the

modes of the waveguide (
< zT ). We found that, for

|
ℓ & 10bo, a two-dimensional version of the model could
reproduce the transmissions and spatial output distribu-
tions of a two dimensional split-operator FFT integration
of ˆHQP C (ˆx, ˆz) with the full waveguide potential. This
agreement gave us conﬁdence in our three-dimensional
model of atom propagation through the constriction.

The cross-section for an incident atomic plane wave
to be transmitted through a constriction is dependent
on the plane-wave energy EI and incident angle. How-
ever, if the RMS angular spread of incident plane waves
σ is much greater than the RMS acceptance angle α

We can understand several features shown in Fig. 3
by considering the adiabatic motion of atoms within
the waveguide. As atom waves propagate though the
constricting waveguide, modes with transverse oscillator
EI & 2M ~2/ℓ2
states (nx, ny) such that ~ωo(nx+ny+1)
will contribute negligible evanescent transmission and
adiabatically reﬂect before z = 0. Steps occur when the
number of allowed propagating modes changes: the mth
step appears at ~ωo = EI /m. Note that this condition
can also be written bo = √mλdB/2π, demonstrating that
transverse conﬁnement on the order of λdB/2π is essen-
tial to seeing conductance steps in a QPC. Since low-lying
modes occupy a circularly symmetric part of the poten-
tial, the mth step involves m degenerate modes and is m
times as high as the ﬁrst step. The large aspect ratio of
the atom QPC allows for a suﬃciently gentle constric-
tion to suppress partial reﬂection at the entrance to the
guide, such that the sharpness of steps and ﬂatness be-
tween them is limited only by the spread in incident atom
energies.

where ∆V is the applied voltage, T is the temperature

the current that ﬂows between them will be carried by
electrons with an energy spread kBT and a mean energy

by kinetics instead of energetics. The incident kinetic
energy EI corresponds to EF , and the energy spread

In order to determine the accuracy of conductance
quantization, three measurements (F , Jof (0, 0), and
λdB) are necessary for the atom QPC instead of two mea-
surements (current and ∆V ) for the electron QPC. The
reduced number of degrees of freedom for electrons re-
sults from their Fermi degeneracy: the net current is car-
ried by electrons whose incident ﬂux density Jo and wave-
length λF are functions of EF and ∆V . As a thought
experiment, the simplicity of an externally tuned Jo and
λdB could also be extended to neutral atoms, if two de-
generate ensembles of Fermionic atoms were connected
by a QPC and given a potential diﬀerence ∆U , such as
could be induced by a uniform magnetic ﬁeld applied to

one reservoir. We can redeﬁne neutral atom conductance
as Γ = F/∆U , where F is the transmitted atom ﬂux, just
as the electron conductance G is the ratio of electron ﬂux
(current) to potential diﬀerence (voltage). One can show
that

of the Fermi ensembles and N is the number of modes

Two QPC’s can form a trap between them, just as a
pair of electron QPC’s form a quantum dot [13]. For
~ωo > EI , all modes of the QPC are below cutoﬀ and
evanescent transmission is dominated by tunneling of
atoms occupying the (0, 0) mode. While the quantum
dot between them is energetically isolated, atoms can still
tunnel into and out of the dot. For cold Fermionic atoms,
the Pauli exclusion principle would enable a single atom
to block transmission through the trap, just as the charg-
ing energy of a single electron can block transmission in
electron quantum dots; such a blockade might be used
to make a single-atom transistor. In such a single-atom
blockade regime, quantum dots can also show a suppres-
sion of shot noise below the Poissonian level [13]. Note
that spectroscopic measurement of neutral atom traps
with resolvable energy levels has been suggested previ-
ously [17] in analogy to spectroscopic measurement of
electron quantum dots. We emphasize that the loading
and observation of such a small trap with two or more
QPC “leads” is a powerful conﬁguration for atom optics,
because loading a small, isolated trap is problematic, and
because spectroscopy near the substrate is complicated
by light scattering and inaccessibility.

In conclusion, we show how an electromagnet wave-
guide could be used to create a quantum point contact
for cold neutral atoms. This device is an example of a
new physical regime, quantum transport within micro-
fabricated atom optics.

arated by a distance S and with anti-parallel current ﬂow
(marked “·” for +z and “×” for −z), are mounted on a sub-
strate (crosshatched), which serves both to support the wires
mechanically and to dissipate the heat produced. A poten-

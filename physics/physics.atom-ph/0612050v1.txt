Abstract

We investigate the interaction of ultracold antihydrogen with a conducting surface. Our discus-

sion focuses on the physical regime where the phenomenon of quantum reﬂection manifests. We

calculate the reﬂection probability as function of incident atom energy. We ﬁnd that, for ground

state ¯H atoms (with T < 10−5 K), the probability of reﬂection is R

1

kb, where k is the momen-

≃

−

tum of the atom and b = 2174.0 a.u. is a constant determined solely by the van der Waals-Casimir

tail of the atom-wall interaction.

We show that quantum reﬂection, which suppresses the direct contact of ultra-cold atoms with

the surface, allows for the possibility of conﬁnement and storage of cold antihydrogen atoms. We

calculate the life-time of conﬁnement as a function of antihydrogen energy. We develop a theory

of ¯H in a wave-guide and propose its application to fundamental measurements.

In particular,

for measurement of retardation corrections in the long-range component of the antiatom - wall

potential. We demonstrate, for ¯H falling in the gravitational ﬁeld of Earth onto a conducting

surface, the existence of quantized ¯H states. We calculate that the lifetime of ultracold ¯H in its

lowest gravitational state and obtain τ = (M gb/2~)−1

0.1 s, where M g is a gravitational force

acting on the antiatom. We propose that measurement of this lifetime may provide a new test for

the gravitational properties of antimatter.

INTRODUCTION

The phenomenon of quantum reﬂection in the ultra-cold atomic collisions has attracted

lots of attention during the last decade. The propensity of an ultra cold atom, under the

inﬂuence of an attractive atom-wall potential, to undergo total reﬂection has been predicted

on quantum-mechanical grounds quite some time ago [1]. However, the observation of this

counter-intuitive eﬀect has only recently been observed in the laboratory [2], [3]. Because

quantum reﬂection prevents atoms from reaching the wall, it suppresses inelastic atom-

surface reactions and thus, it can be exploited as an important tool for manipulating cold

atoms [4]. Another reason for interest in quantum reﬂection is that it occurs at large atom-

wall distances where retardation eﬀects are important. Retardation leads to the Casimir

eﬀect [5, 6, 7], where the van der Waals 1/z3 atom-surface potential melds into a 1/z4 power

law potential at large distances. Quantum reﬂection is sensitive to the long-range component

of the atom-surface potential [8] and may therefore allow new tests for the predictions of

QED [3, 9, 10, 11].

Recent success in the production of the cold antihydrogen (further referred to as ¯H)

[12, 13] has spurred renewed interest in this ﬁeld. The ultimate goal of the antihydrogen

project, initiated at CERN, is to enable accurate tests of CPT and gravitational properties

of antimatter. Such a capability requires the availability of ultra-cold antiatoms. Quantum

reﬂection may provide a new tool that hastens the realization of laboratory measurements.

We will show that an interesting manifestation of quantum reﬂection, for antiatoms, is the
existence of long-lived states of ultracold ¯H in material cavities. We introduce a theory

of wave-guides for anti-atoms and discuss their possible application in laboratory studies.

Measurement of anti-atom life-times in a cavity may provide valuable information on the

properties of the long range interaction between the antiatom and the surface. The mea-

surement of the gravitational force acting on an antiatom poses as an intriguing possibility.
An essential property of antiatom-surface interaction is annihilation of ¯H on the surface.
Anti-atoms that are not reﬂected are lost to annihilation and ¯H-wall annihilation events can

be detected to measure the quantum reﬂection probability.

In Sec. II we discuss quantum reﬂection of ¯H impinging on a perfectly conducting surface

at normal incidence and present a calculation for the reﬂection probability. The latter is

given as a function of incident energy, including the zero energy limit characterized by the

2

complex scattering length. In section III we study the probability for quantum reﬂection as

function of the antiatom - wall distance. In Sec. IV we apply our theory and calculate the
lifetimes of ¯H enclosed in a material cavity. In Sec. V we discuss the passage of ¯H through

wave-guides. In Sec. VI we discuss the possibility for application of quantum reﬂection in

measurements of the gravitational properties of an antiatom. Finally, in Sec. VII we study

the loosely bound states of atoms conﬁned in the atom-wall potential. We show that such

states strongly aﬀect quantum reﬂection when absorption by the wall is weak. We discuss

the physical conditions corresponding to the limiting cases of weak and strong absorption

(annihilation) on the surface and show that, in the latter case, the (anti)atom-wall states

are destroyed.

II. QUANTUM REFLECTION AND ABSORPTION

Quantum reﬂection from an attractive (with a suﬃciently large derivative) potential is

known to manifest [14] at low energies. In our discussion we are mainly interested in those

cases where the probability of quantum reﬂection is close to 1. The qualitative parameter

associated with the quantum motion of the particle with mass m and energy E in the
potential V (z) is the local de Broglie wavelength λB(z) = 2π~/

V (z)). One

Condition (2) deﬁnes the domain where the reﬂected wave is generated and is applicable

A detailed discussion of the ultra-cold atom quantum reﬂection can be found in refs. [8, 15,
16]. The ¯H – wall interaction is described by the potential, hereafter denoted V (z). It is

use VCP (z) calculated in [17]. At distances zs ≪

that the above expressions for C3 and C4 are valid in the limit of perfect conducting surface

[5], and can be speciﬁed for a realistic metal or dielectric surface at ﬁnite temperature [18].

into account by imposing full absorption on the wall implemented in the manner described

4 that the scattering length approximation (eq. (17) becomes valid for E < 10−11 a.u. i.e.

when kb

1, but the validity of the non-perturbative approximation (given in column 3)

extends to higher temperatures.

It is interesting to compare this value for the scattering length with the corresponding

value for the purely homogeneous potential

C4/z4 with the full absorption at the origin.

We note that the imaginary part of the scattering length aCP is rather close to the value
C4/z4 potential and suggest that the main contribution

obtained for a purely homogeneous

−

to the penetration probability arises from the asymptotic Casimir tail (7). The nonzero real

part of the scattering length is the contribution from distances where the potential changes

from the van der Waals (6) to the Casimir limit (7). In fact, one can see from (21) that

the real part of the scattering length for the purely homogeneous potential with s = 4 (with

absorptive core) is exactly zero, while for s < 4 it is negative.

p

the incoming or outgoing wave is unambiguous only in case when it can be represented in the

semiclassical form exp(

range of antiatom-wall distances, the solution everywhere has the form of an incoming wave

and no reﬂection occurs. However, for certain regions (2) of antiatom-wall separation, the

WKB approximation fails (the so-called badlands). The solution of the Schr¨odinger equation

diﬀers from the semiclassical one and leads to the appearance of a reﬂected wave. Hence

the function B(z) in (35) can be interpreted as a function that ”converts” the semi-classical

We need to put one more condition on A(z) and B(z) in order to deﬁne them uniquely.

Following the phase function method [22, 23] we require that

As z

0 the WKB approximation becomes valid. Using it (and thus reﬂection from these

parts of potential exponentially decreases) we found that the contribution to the amplitude

of the reﬂected wave from the distances z < 100 a.u. is indeed small.

In addition, at ultra-low energies (practically for E

10−10 a.u.) the reﬂected wave is

generated within a wide range of distances. In that case we cannot deﬁne an unambiguous

”reﬂection distance”. The plot shows that for the energy E = 10−12 a.u. the reﬂection

probability is 0.88 and this value is in harmony with the calculated value presented in Table

distances, from 100 a.u. up to 500 a.u., the contribution is 22%. However, with increasing

energy the reﬂecting domain is more localized and is shifted to shorter distances, whereas

the reﬂection probability is diminished. According to Fig.1, for E = 10−10 a.u. the reﬂection

probability is 0.31 and 92% of the reﬂected wave is generated in the domain from 100 a.u.

up to 1000 a.u. In this case the reﬂection probability reaches its full value within a well

deﬁned interval ∆z around zr, and allows us to deﬁne zr, the ”reﬂection distance”. At higher

energies, reﬂection occurs at the reﬂection distance ( ∆z

zr ) and the reﬂection probability

≪

becomes exponentially small. The reﬂection coeﬃcient as well as reﬂection distance zr can

be estimated using ”complex turning point method” [8, 24, 25].

As discussed above, the real part of the scattering length is more sensitive to the details

of the potential at intermediate distances. More generally, one can expect that the real part

of the phase shift δ(E) (deﬁned through the equality S = exp(2iδ(E))) provides additional

information on the antiatom-surface interaction. In Fig. 2 we plot Re δ(E) for the exact

interaction VCP (z), as well as for two model interactions V1 =

In conclusion, we emphasize that annihilation of ¯H on the surface allows a description

that depends only on the nature of the van- der Waals-Casimir potential.

In particular

all inelastic processes that occur at characteristic distances of few a.u. (including thermal
heating of ¯H atoms by phonon exchange [26, 27]) do not aﬀect the reﬂected wave.

In the case of strong absorption the phase and amplitude of the reﬂected wave are in-

dependent inn details of the short-range interaction. This allows one to glean important

information on parameters that characterize the van der Waals-Casimir atom-wall potential.

In the limit of a perfectly conducting surface, they are solely determined by the dynamical
dipole polarizability of ¯H. Our treatment can be generalized to the case of ﬁnite conductiv-

ity or non-zero temperatures by introducing corrections to the Casimir-Polder interaction

12

constants [18]. In particular, the simple estimation of ¯H quantum reﬂection constant b in

case of dielectric surface can be obtained using expression (22) with the modiﬁed value of

b for polyethylene (ǫ

2.3) is b

1138.9 a.u., which is approximately twice smaller than

in case of perfect conducting surface. As a consequence the characteristic energy, for which

quantum reﬂection from polyethylene surface starts to be signiﬁcant (kb

1, E = 1/(2mb2))

∼

is four times greater, than in case of perfect conducting surface.

In the following section we consider the conﬁnement of antihydrogen between material

walls. In particular we show how the properties of quantum reﬂection are related to the
shifts and widths of the energy levels of ¯H atoms enclosed in cavities with conducting walls.

IV. ULTRACOLD ¯H BETWEEN TWO CONDUCTING WALLS

The partial reﬂection of ultra-cold ¯H from the material wall enables the existence of
quasi-stationary (decaying) states of ¯H in-between two walls. In so far we will be interested

in the one-dimensional wave-function of such states. We expect that the distance L between

The level shifts and widths are determined by the value of complex scattering length

, c.f. eq. 18) that characterizes quantum reﬂection. The lifetimes increase with

the wall separation as L3 and decrease with the excitation quantum number as n2. These

expressions are obtained using the assumption that the scattering length approximation (15)

is valid, and restricts its validity for εn < 10−11 a.u.

The solutions Φn(z), corresponding to the complex energy levels

En, are the eigen-
functions of a non-self-adjoint Hamiltonian. In fact, they are decaying quasi-bound states
with energy εn −

iΓn/2. This implies that such states obey the bi-orthogonality condition

is just its time of ﬂight between the walls.

As an example, we take L = 10 µm which is much greater than the length scale b = 0.115

µm, that characterize the Casimir force. At this wall separation distance, the ground state

energy is ε0 = 7.5 10−14 a.u. the width is Γ0 = 1.7 10−15 a.u. and corresponds to the lifetime

0.014 s. We compare this value to the time of ﬂight between the walls t = L/v = 0.0005
s. Thus ¯H in this state bounces about 30 times before it annihilates. Since the life time

is proportional to L3, and the passage time to L2, the number of the bounces between the

walls grows linearly with L. Let us mention here that the concept of quasi-stationary state

itself is meaningful only in case its life-time is much greater than the corresponding time of

ﬂight between the walls.

V. ANTIHYDROGEN IN A WAVE-GUIDE

A laboratory demonstration of quantum reﬂection states could realized by introducing
¯H atoms through a slit between parallel conducting walls separated by distance L. (The

similar principle was used to observe quantum motion of neutrons in the gravitational ﬁeld
of Earth [28, 29]. Ignoring, for the moment, the inﬂuence of gravitation on ¯H, we align the

conducting walls parallel to the gravitational ﬁeld. The Schr¨odinger equation, that governs

the motion of antiatoms inside the wave-guide with transverse dimension z and horizontal

dimension x, is

Ψ(z, x) =

Cn exp(ipnx)Φn(z)

(47)

where Cn are the amplitudes of corresponding states, dependent on the properties of

the ﬂux entering the wave-guide, and pn is the horizontal momentum of the state with the

Let us mention that the eigen-functions Φn(z) of not-self-adjoint Hamiltonian do not

form a basis in the Hilbert space [30]. So far the expansion (47) is an approximation. We

will show however that under certain conditions of the wave-guide experiment few quasi-

stationary states from (47) would be give exhaustive contribution to the measured ﬂux,

which veriﬁes our approach.

If the characteristic spatial dimension of the incoming ﬂux H0 is much larger than the

separation L and the distribution of the transverse velocity in the incoming ﬂux exceeds

the value 1/L, the ﬁrst few excited states are uniformly distributed. Because the transverse

a term is not surprising. Indeed, decaying states are not stationary and they don’t have well

deﬁned energies and so they can be thought of as a superposition of truly stationary states.
Therefore transitions between states with frequencies ωnk = εk −
εn occur. The transitions
manifest in the appearance of the oscillating exponents exp(iωnkτ pass) in the expression

for the measured ﬂux (51). However, observation of such interference requires rather good

resolution in the horizontal velocities of the initial ﬂux. The uncertainty in passage time
δτ pass = τ passδv/v is of order of ω−1

nk , and it follows that the limit for horizontal velocity

resolution is

δv

< τ passωnk.

For a broader distribution in the horizontal velocity, the interference terms cancel due to

fast oscillating exponents and the expression for the ﬂux takes the form

X

The time of ﬂight τ pass may be chosen in such a way that only a few transverse states
with the smallest Γn = n2Γ1 contribute to the ﬂux of ¯H in the wave-guide. This time of

ﬂight selects the states with small transversal energy εn and thus our expression for the

horizontal momentum (49) is justiﬁed. Let us also note that such a choice of time of ﬂight

ensures that contribution of quasi-stationary states to the ﬂux at the exit of the wave-guide

is much greater than the contribution of all the ”non-resonant” terms, which were neglected

in the approximative expansion (47) of the total wave-function [31]. The typical length d
for a ﬂux of ¯H with the horizontal velocity v = 10 m/s should be about 10 cm to ensure

that only the ground transverse state passes through the slit L = 10 µm. Changing the

slit separation leads to an enhanced contribution from the excited transversal states, due to

the dependence (43) of the decaying rates Γn on L. The measured function F (L) provides

information on the parameter b. In particular, if only the ground state passes through the

guide, one gets the following (C1 and F0 independent) expression for b

We stress that the quantity b above is very sensitive to the Casimir force since quantum

reﬂection in the guide selects only those antiatoms that have interacted with the surface

through the van der Waals - Casimir potential (all others are annihilated).

VI. GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS

We have shown that quantum reﬂection takes place for very slow anti-atoms. This fact

could be exploited to study the gravitational properties of anti-atoms. In this section we

discuss the possibility for measuring the gravitational force acting on antihydrogen. We dis-

tinguish between the gravitational mass, which we refer to as M and inertial mass, hereafter
denoted by m. We consider an ¯H atom bouncing above a conducting surface in the gravita-

tional ﬁeld of Earth. Conﬁnement is achieved by quantum scattering by the van der Waals-

Casimir potential from below, and by the gravitational ﬁeld from above. The characteristic

length and energy scales are

The characteristic scale of the gravitational energy of ¯H is ε = 2.211 10−14 a.u., whereas

the corresponding length scale is l0 = 5.871 µm and is much greater than the length scale,

(b = 0.115 µm ), of the Casimir force. Thus, the gravitational ﬁeld does not signiﬁcantly

aﬀect the atom-wall interaction. The energy levels and the corresponding wave-functions

are

We note factorization of gravitational eﬀects (appearing in the above formula via fac-

tor Mg) with the eﬀect of quantum reﬂection, appearing through the constant b. Such a
factorization is a consequence of the small ratio in the characteristic scale b/l0 ≃

0.02.

We ﬁnd that the widths of the gravitational states (63) are independent of the energy (for

the energies En < 10−11 a.u.) to the ﬁrst order in the small ratio b/λn. This is understood

using the following simple argument. The frequency of the atom bouncing above the surface

in the gravitational ﬁeld is ω

1/√E, whereas the probability (17) of annihilation on the

The measurement of this lifetime can be achieved by monitoring the spatial decay of the

ﬂux of antiatoms with the velocity v parallel to the surface. Such a ﬂux, as function of the

VII. SURFACE STATES FOR ATOMS AND ANTIATOMS

Our treatment of quantum reﬂection of antiatoms makes use of the fact that the antiatom-

wall interaction is strongly absorptive at short distance, and is mathematically expressed by

absorption condition (11). In this section we study the case where absorption on the surface

is not necessarily strong. Such a situation may correspond to the partial loss of ordinary

atoms that undergo inelastic interaction at the surface, or to reﬂection of antiatoms from

partially transparent evanescent-wave atomic mirror.

Below we outline a resonance-type dependence of the atom loss probability on the proper-

ties of the short range interaction in case of the weak surface absorption. We show that such

resonance behavior stems from the presence of narrow near-threshold atom-surface states

[33].

For the purpose of illustration, and in order to allow an analytic description, we replace

the exact van der Waals-Casimir potential by the model potential (24). We do not impose

the full absorption boundary condition, instead the complex phase-shift δs, produced by the

short-range interaction is used.

For the model potential Vm, the analytic expression for the scattering length (29) simpliﬁes

substantially since ξ = 2C3

prominent are the oscillations. The maxima occur when

This example illustrates the inﬂuence of near-threshold singularities on the S-matrix and

we express the S-matrix in the vicinity of its pole

Taking into account that for small k

The maximum in the loss probability occurs when the pole z of the S-matrix crosses the

real axis of the complex k-plane. In the absence of absorption, the pole lies on the imaginary

axis of the complex k-plane and when it crosses the real axis the scattering length approaches

positive inﬁnity. In the presence of absorption the pole has a real negative component. The

smaller the shift from the imaginary axis, the more pronounced the eﬀect.

δ2 = 0.1, and it is practically washed out in case of stronger absorption δ2 = 1.0.

In the hypothetical case where the short range part of the (anti)atom-wall interaction

can be varied in a controlled way (e.g. by reﬂection from the optical evanescent wave) one

could accurately measure the properties of the (anti)atom-wall potential by careful tuning

of resonances and ﬁtting the experimental data to eq. (82). In this way, one could measure

the values of the C3 and C4 coeﬃcients.

In conclusion, we ﬁnd that the main diﬀerence in quantum reﬂection in cases of strong

and weak absorption by the material wall is that in the latter case, narrow atom-surface

states can be formed. The position of these states depends on the short range interaction.

The presence of a near-threshold state strongly enhances the probability of atom loss, and

might be used for resonant spectroscopy (e.g. with the use of optical evanescent wave). In

case of strong absorption, the near-threshold states are completely destroyed by annihilation.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

We presented a theoretical account of cold antiatoms interacting with a material wall.

We focused on the antihydrogen - wall system where the latter is represented by an ideally

conducting surface. We have shown that, as antiatoms approach the surface in an attractive

potential they are not necessarily annihilated.

If suﬃciently cold, they may be totally

reﬂected. Reﬂection occurs in the region where the long range tail of the van der Waals -

Casimir interaction dominates. We calculated the reﬂection probability as function of the

incident energy of antiatoms. We analyzed the behavior of the reﬂected wave as a function

of distance from the surface and introduced the notion of a ”reﬂection distance”. We have

also shown that quantum reﬂection allows the existence of long-lived metastable states of
¯H in the conducting cavity.

We pointed out that scattering of ultra-cold ¯H in an attractive van der Waals - Casimir

potential is sensitive to retardation in the antiatom-wall interaction. We explored the possi-

25

bility of performing experimental measurements with ¯H by introducing it into a wave-guide.
The rate of the ¯H annihilation on the wall of the guide could provide important informa-

tion on retardation eﬀects in matter-antimatter systems.

In the strong absorption limit,

such measurements are not ”contaminated” by eﬀects produced on the wall and which are

characterized by poorly known short-range parameters. However, they could be employed
to study the asymptotic properties of ¯H- wall interaction.

We also proposed measurement of eﬀects due to gravity acting on the antihydrogen. In
particular we found that the life-time of ¯H, in the combined gravitational and the mirror

image potential of a conducting plate, to be on the order of 0.1 s. The established dependence
of that lifetime, τ = 2~/(Mgb), on the gravitational force allows the possibility for measuring

the gravitational properties of antimatter.

Finally, we outlined the role of the near-threshold atom-surface states the where absorp-

tion on the surface is small. For antiatoms, weak absorption could arise with the introduction

of an evanescent wave that prevents antiatoms from direct contact with the wall. We showed

that a resonant increase in the absorption rate can be observed if the atom-wall interaction

is ”tuned” to form an atom-wall state at the threshold. We note the possibility of exploiting

resonant absorption for studies of atom-surface interactions.

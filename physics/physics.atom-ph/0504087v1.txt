exitation energies (EEs) with respet to the ground state and related properties suh osillator

strengths, transition probabilities, nulear magneti dipole and eletri quadrupole moments are also

omputed to assess the auray of the sheme. The eletri quadrupole oupling onstant obtained

from the present alulation is o(cid:27) by less than 1% from the experiment. The IPs and EEs also

agree with experiment to 0.06 eV or better and the (cid:28)ne struture splittings are aurate to better

than 0.001 eV. The one-eletron properties reported here are also in exellent agreement with the

experiment.

1 Introdution

Theoretial determinations of hyper(cid:28)ne oupling onstants and transition dipole matrix elements are

stringent tests of atomi wave funtions near as well as at a large distane from nuleus [1, 2℄. The

aurate predition of hyper(cid:28)ne oupling onstants and other related atomi properties suh as transition

energies, osillator strengths, lifetime et. also requires preise inorporation of relativisti and higher

order orrelation e(cid:27)ets as these e(cid:27)ets are strongly entangled [3℄. In partiular, the hyper(cid:28)ne oupling

onstant and dipole matrix element alulations are relevant to the parity non-onservation (PNC)

studies in atoms as PNC transition amplitudes involve both short range eletro-weak interation and

dipole matrix element [4℄.

The relativisti and dynamial eletron orrelation e(cid:27)ets an be inorporated in many-eletron sys-

tems through a variety of many-body methods. Among these approahes, the oupled luster method

(CCM) has emerged as one of the most powerful and e(cid:27)etive tool for a high preision desription of

eletron orrelations in many-eletron systems [5℄. The CCM is an all-order non-perturbative sheme,

and therefore, the higher order eletron orrelation e(cid:27)ets an be inorporated more e(cid:30)iently than

using the order-by-order diagrammati many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) [1℄. The CC method

is size-extensive, a property whih has been found to be ruial for an aurate determination of state

energies, bond leavage energies and related spetrosopi onstants. Sine the order-by-order MBPT

expansion terms are diretly related to the CC equations (as the latter is an all-order version of the

former sheme), the CC results an be improved by adding the important omitted diagrams with the aid

of low order MBPT.

quadrupole oupling onstant of

The nulear quadrupole moment Q of

27Al is of interest in several researh area. The nulear
27Al was measured in ioni rystals [6, 7℄ and in metalli alloys [8℄.
The nulear quadrupole moment Q is then determined by ombining the alulated eletri (cid:28)eld gradient
(q) at the nuleus with the experimental quadrupole oupling onstant. In 1976, Rogers et al [9℄ em-
ployed the seond order MBPT method to determine the nulear quadrupole moment Q for the lowest
27Al. Later, Sundholm and Olsen [10℄ omputed Q(2P3/2) of Al using restrited ative
2P3/2 state of

spae (RAS) based multi-on(cid:28)gurational Hartree-Fok (MCHF) approah [11℄. However, none of these

1

alulations provide aurate estimate of Q value for this system. These orrelated alulations further

indiate that inlusion of higher order eletron orrelation e(cid:27)ets is neessary to improve the auray

of nulear quadrupole moment of

27Al.

In this artile, we report the magneti dipole and eletri quadrupole oupling onstants for two lowest

2P3/2 state of

27Al obtained from relativisti oupled luster method. We also present the ionization
27Al. E(cid:27)ets of eletron orrelations on the

potential, transition energies and other related properties of

omputed quantities are investigated using di(cid:27)erent levels of CC approximation. In the present work,

we ompare atomi properties of

27Al obtained from oupled luster and unitary oupled luster (UCC)

method to aess the relative performane and auray of these two shemes. The UCC [12℄ and its

variants [13, 14, 15, 16℄ were developed almost two deades ago to inorporate higher order eletron

orrelation e(cid:27)et systematially. Reently we have applied the relativisti UCC in atomi systems for

the (cid:28)rst time to alulate properties like lifetime of exited states [17℄. To our knowledge, no prior

UCC alulations are available for this system. Thus, the present work will be the (cid:28)rst appliation of

relativisti UCC method to this atomi system.

are disussed in the subsequent setion.

2 Methodology

Sine the Coupled Cluster methods used in this work are disussed elsewhere[13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19℄, we

only outline the essential features of the method here.

In this work, we employ the straight forward extension of non-relativisti oupled luster theory to

the relativisti regime by adopting the no-virtual-pair approximation (NVPA) along with appropriate

modi(cid:28)ation of orbital form and potential terms [20℄. We begin with Dira-Coulomb Hamiltonian (HD )

3 Computational Details

The Fok-spae relativisti oupled luster method is applied to ompute the ground and exited state

energies of Al. The Dira-Fok equations are (cid:28)rst solved for the alkali metal ion M +

, whih de(cid:28)nes the (0-

hole,0-partile) setor of the Fok spae. The ion is then orrelated using the losed shell CCSD/LCCSD,

after whih one-eletron is added following the Fok-spae sheme

Both the DF and relativisti CC programs utilize the angular momentum deomposition of the wave-

funtions and CC equations. Using the Juys- Levinson-Vanagas (JLV) theorem [22℄, the Goldstone

diagrams are expressed as a produts of angular momentum diagrams and redued matrix element. This

proedure simpli(cid:28)es the omputational omplexity of the DF and relativisti CC equations. Appropriate

onstraints are also imposed to avoid (cid:16)variational ollapse(cid:17) and (cid:16)ontinuum dissolution(cid:17).

In the atual omputation, the DF ground state and exited state properties of Al are omputed using

the (cid:28)nite basis set expansion method (FBSE) [23℄ with a large basis set of (32s28p24d15f ) Gaussian

funtions of the form

with k = 0, 1, . . . for s, p, . . . type funtions, respetively. For the exponents, the even tempering ondition

(15)

(16)

is applied. Here, N is the number of basis funtions for a spei(cid:28) symmetry. The self-onsistent DF

orbitals are stored on a grid. It is assumed that virtual orbitals with high energies do not ontribute

signi(cid:28)antly to properties like IPs. In the CCSD alulations, we therefore trunate the virtual s, p, d
and f orbitals above 1000 a.u., 1000 a.u., 500 a.u. and 100 a.u., respetively.

4 Results and Disussions

Table 1 ompares the IP, EE and FS of Al atom omputed using CC methods with the experiment[24℄.

As it an be seen from Table 1 that UCC estimates the IP, EEs and FS more aurately than CCSD

and LCCSD approah. Though not well understood but the present as well as some earlier studies [25℄

indiate that the IPs omputed with LCCSD sheme are often more aurate than the orresponding

CCSD estimate. For instane, the

o(cid:27) from

the experimental value, while the orresponding CC value is o(cid:27) by 124 cm−1

. However, it an be seen in

2P1/2(3p1/2) IP estimated using LCCSD method is 84 cm−1

Table 1 that the CCSD estimate of EE and FS are more aurate than the LCCSD sheme (for the low

lying states) exept the ionization potential (IP). For the high lying states the di(cid:27)erene in the omputed

FS value among LCCSD, CCSD and UCC is not signi(cid:28)ant.

Table 2 ompares the nulear quadrupole moments Q omputed using CC methods with the exper-

iment [26℄ and with other theoretial alulations [9, 10℄. It is evident from Table 2 that the seond

order MBPT alulations by Rogers et al.

[9℄ overestimates the Q value by 13%. Multi-on(cid:28)guration
Hartree-Fok (MCHF) [11℄ though yield reasonably aurate estimate of Q than the seond order MBPT,
but still the omputed Q value is not quite aurate (o(cid:27) by ∼ 4%). The trend of MBPT(2) and MCHF

results strongly indiates that the ontribution of higher order term is non-negligible and this is further

supported by the CC estimate of Q value. The extremely aurate estimate of Q o(cid:27)ered by LCCSD

sheme is perhaps a bit fortuitous. Nevertheless, the performane of CC, espeially the UCC, outshines

the MBPT(2) and MCHF treatments. Note that the e(cid:27)ets of partial triple and quadrupole exitations

are present in UCC alulations in the same level of approximations.

The eletri quadrupole (B ) and magneti dipole (A) hyper(cid:28)ne matrix elements for the ground and

exited states of Al omputed using the LCCSD, CCSD and UCC methods are displayed in Table 3. This

table learly demonstrates that the UCC estimate of the eletri quadrupole moment for

2P3/2(3p3/2 )

state of Al is quite aurate (o(cid:27) by only 0.166 MHz or 0.8%) ompared to the other two CC variants. To

our knowledge, the experimental A and B value for exited states of Al are not available. However, the
2P3/2(3p3/2 ) state strongly suggests that our predited
auray of our omputed IP, EE, FS, and B for
A and B value for exited states of Al will also be quite aurate.

In Table 4, we ompare the 3p1/2 → 4s and 3p3/2 → 3s transition energies (λ), osillator strengths
(fik ), line strengths (Sik ) and transition probabilities (Aik ) obtained from LCCSD, CCSD and UCC
shemes with the experiment. Table 4 shows that our omputed quantities (λ, Sik , and Aik ) are in

exellent agreement with experiment espeially those predited by UCC sheme. That the UCC sheme

provides more aurate estimate of IP, EE et., is also evident from Figure 1, where the absolute errors

(in %) in the omputed properties are plotted against di(cid:27)erent CC shemes.

5 Conluding remarks

The relativisti open-shell oupled luster sheme for diret energy di(cid:27)erene alulations (and related

one eletron properties) is presented and applied to Al. In this work, we investigate the e(cid:27)ets of eletron

orrelations on the ground and exited state properties using di(cid:27)erent levels of CC approximations. We

have shown that unitary oupled luster (UCC) method is apable to providing aurate estimate of

transition energies and related properties. The present work further demonstrates that aurate estimate

of atomi properties like nulear quadrupole moment (Q) requires higher order orrelation e(cid:27)ets whih

an be inorporated via UCC sheme in an e(cid:30)ient manner.

We review the progress made in the determination of the weak charge, QW , of the cesium
nucleus which raises the status of Atomic Parity Violation measurements to that of a
precision electroweak test. Not only is it necessary to have a precision measurement of
the electroweak asymmetry in the highly forbidden 6S-7S transition, but one also needs
a precise calibration procedure. The 1999 precision measurement by the Boulder group
implied a 2.5 σ deviation of QW from the theoretical prediction. This triggered many
particle physicist suggestions as well as examination by atomic theoretical physicists of
several sources of corrections. After about three years the disagreement was removed
without appealing to ”New Physics”. Concurrently, an original experimental approach
was developed in our group for more than a decade. It is based on detection by stimu-
lated emission with ampliﬁcation of the left-right asymmetry. We present our decisive,
recent progress together with our latest results. We emphasize the important impact for
electroweak theory, of future measurements in cesium possibly pushed to the 0.1% level.
Other possible approaches are currently explored in several atoms.

Keywords: Electroweak interference; nuclear weak charge; atomic parity violation;
stimulated-emission detection.

1. Introduction

In this short review paper we intend to survey the theoretical and experimental
progress made in Atomic Parity Violation since the emergence of the ﬁeld in 1974.
First (
2), we indicate the connection between Atomic Parity Violation (APV) and
§
Electroweak (EW) Theory. Everything centres around one electroweak parameter,
the weak charge of an atomic nucleus, QW , associated with the exchange of the Z0
boson between the atomic electron and nucleus. We provide a short background to
APV experiments. How can Z0 bosons aﬀect atomic radiative transitions? How is
QW extracted from experiment? Besides the measurement of a left-right asymmetry
itself, ALR, the theoretical interpretation of the result requires state of the art

triggered important theoretical eﬀorts. It also gave additional motivations for our
current Cs experiment in Paris, presented next. We show that this experiment
now provides valuable PV data by a method totally diﬀerent from Boulder. We
indicate other possible experimental approaches, in diﬀerent atoms, under current
investigation. Finally (
§

5), we dicuss the relevance today of APV experiments.

2. Electroweak parity violation in atoms

For a naive estimate of ALR let us consider two radiative electron-hadron processes
(Fig. 1, Left and center), the ﬁrst one of amplitude Aem governed exclusively by
electromagnetic interactions, and the second one of amplitude AW associated with
a Z0 boson exchange. The weak amplitude AW contains a part which is odd under
space reﬂexion, which will give rise to a left-right asymmetry ALR by interference
with the dominant electromagnetic amplitude. For two mirror-image experiments

we obtain two diﬀerent transition probabilities: PL/R =

If q denotes the four-momentum transfer between the lepton and the hadron, Aem
is proportional to e2/q2 while AW ∝

Such a result would appear to make the observation of the left-right asymmetry in
atoms completely hopeless. Fortunately there are important enhancement mecha-
nisms which make this naive estimate far too pessimistic. In fact, in actual experi-
ments, ALR can be as large as a few times 10−6.

Atomic Parity Violation 3

The ﬁrst source of enhancement ﬁnds its origin in the so-called Z 3 law. This
law predicted by C. Bouchiat and one of the authors (M.-A. B.) in 19743,4 states
that the electroweak eﬀects in atoms should grow a little faster than the cube of the
atomic number Z. Indeed, for valence electrons belonging to penetrating orbitals,
like s1/2 or p1/2, the orbital is deformed in the vicinity of the atomic nucleus, right
where the short range interaction takes place. It looks like the orbital associated
with a Coulomb potential of charge Z, whose radius is given by a0/Z. Hence, in
is enhanced by the factor Z 2. Moreover, the various
heavy atoms the factor
nucleons in the atomic nucleus add their contributions coherently. Since, in heavy
atoms, the number of nucleons grows roughly as Z, the overall enhancement eﬀect
is proportional to Z 3.

For a more quantitative analysis it is necessary to introduce the parity violating

electron-nucleus potential which, in the non-relativistic limit, can be written as:

Vpv(re) =

QW GF
4√2

(cid:0) δ3( ~re) ~σe.~ve/c + h.c. (cid:1) .

(2)

Here we have kept the dominant contribution in which the Z0 couples to the electron
as an axial vector and to the nucleons as a vector. Consequently, the strength of
this interaction is naturally expressed in terms of a nuclear charge, QW . For the
electroweak interaction this charge plays the same role as the nuclear electric charge
for the Coulomb interaction. Hence its name, the ”weak nuclear charge”. Like the
electric nuclear charge, Z, the weak charge QW is the sum of the weak charges of
all the constituents of the atomic nucleus, the u and d quarks :

QW = (2Z + N )QW (u) + (Z + 2N )QW (d) .

The second source of enhancement comes from the possibility of exciting highly
7S1/2 transition in cesium. In a transition
forbidden transitions like the 6S1/2 →
7S1/2 the electromagnetic selection rules strictly forbid the ex-
such as 6S1/2 →
istence of an electric dipole transition. The weak interaction associated with Z0
exchange breaks this rule and gives rise to a parity violating electric dipole ampli-

aThis formula is valid only to lowest order in the electroweak interaction.
bNote that Z0 exchange gives rise to a transition electric dipole, not to a static electric
dipole. The reason is that this PV weak interaction preserves time reversal invariance,
while a static dipole would be a manifestation of simultaneous P and T violation. Another
consequence of time reversal invariance is that Epv
1 is pure imaginary in a phase convention
where M1 is real.3

Once the Z 3 enhancement became apparent, the main question was how best
to take advantage of it. There were in fact two diﬀerent lines of attack. The ﬁrst
7S1/2 in ce-
takes advantage of highly forbidden M1 transitions such as 6S1/2 →
sium. Its merits are the relatively large asymmetry and the simple atomic structure
characteristic of an alkali atom which has a single valence electron outside a tight
atomic core. This type of transition, however, represented completely new territory
1014, so that one could antic-
and the suppression factor looked absolutely huge,
ipate diﬃculties with the signal-to-noise ratio. Nevertheless, this was the approach
chosen by our group in Paris and later on by the Boulder group5. The forbidden M1
7P1/2 transition in Tl was selected by the Berkeley group6. The second line
6P1/2 −
of attack consists in working with allowed M1 transitions in atoms of even higher Z
such as Tl, Pb and Bi, with Z respectively equal to 81, 82, and 83. The suppression
factor is only 105 and a priori this should avoid the signal-to-noise diﬃculties. This
approach was adopted at Oxford7, Seattle8, Novosibirsk9 and Moscow10. Precise
measurements in these elements have been achieved, but presently the diﬃculty lies
in the more complicated atomic structure. The accuracy in QW is today limited by
the precision in atomic calculations. For this reason this presentation is limited to
the case of cesium where the most precise determination has been so far achieved.

3. APV in the highly forbidden cesium transition: Past results

3.1. General principle of the Cs experiments

In order to observe the atomic transition well above the background coming from
loosely bound cesium dimers, we apply a static electric ﬁeld E. This ﬁeld induces a
transition electric dipole dind via parity-conserving mixing of atomic P states with
S states. In this induced dipole

dind = αE + i β ~σ

E ,

×

(5)

there are actually two contributions, one due to the scalar transition polarizability
α, and the other to the vector polarizability β. Here ~σ stands for the electron
spin operator. The coupling of dind to the electric radiation ﬁeld ˆǫex provided by
a resonant laser wave, gives rise to an induced electric dipole amplitude, Eind

Experiments only measure amplitude ratios like Im Epv

1 /βE and since β is
known from atomic theory only to within 1% accuracy, there was a crucial need
for an accurately known amplitude usable for absolute calibration. Fortunately, as
shown in 1988 by our ENS-Paris group11,12, a very precisely known transition
amplitude does exist. In zero electric ﬁeld the M1 6S1/2 →
7S1/2 Cs transition
amplitude contains a certain contribution M hf
M1, induced by the oﬀ-
diagonal hyperﬁne interaction. Experimentally this contribution is easily identiﬁed
because it contributes only to the
1 hyperﬁne lines and with opposite
|
signs. The key-point is that, up to corrections less than 0.25% coming from many-
body eﬀects11,13,14, M hf
can be expressed in terms of the geometrical mean of the
1
diagonal matrix elements11, i.e. the hyperﬁne splittings ∆W of the two S states,
themselves measured in cesium with high precision: M hf
∆W7S. Fi-
nally, as advocated in ref.12, a precise measurement of M hf

absolute determination of β thereby making possible an absolute determination of

The atomic orbitals and the valence-state energies are perturbed by many-body
eﬀects. Initially, two diﬀerent approaches have been employed, one semi-empirical15,
and the second starting from ﬁrst-principles16,17, following techniques inspired from
4.1 for more
ﬁeld theory to perform relativistic many-body computations (see
details). Results agree within the stated precision.

§

3.2. Completed Cs experiments: the very ﬁrst in Paris, and a high

precision one in Boulder

The experiment completed in Paris18, in 1982 and 1983, was the ﬁrst carried out
in cesium. The detected signal was the circularly polarized ﬂuorescence on the
6P1/2 transition following circularly polarized 6S-7S excitation in a trans-
7S1/2 −
verse E ﬁeld. With 12 % experimental accuracy and a theoretical uncertainty at
that time less than 8 %, it has led to a quantitative test of the standard electroweak
theory in the electron-hadron sector, which is of a new kind3. Because of the low

In particular, it provides a test for additional neutral vector bosons. This point will
be discussed for the present context in the last section.

APV can also be a source of valuable information relevant for nuclear physics,
via the nuclear-spin-dependent PV interaction. The relevant experimental parame-
ter involved here, is the diﬀerence between the two asymmetries measured on two
diﬀerent hyperﬁne lines belonging to the same transitionc. If non-zero, the quantity:

is a manifestation of the nuclear-spin-dependent interaction. An eﬀect of about 4%
is expected as a result of the parity violating interactions taking place inside the nu-
cleus between the quarks. The valence electron is contaminated by photon exchange
(see the corresponding diagram represented on Fig. 1, right). The theoretical con-
cept relevant for describing this eﬀect is the nuclear anapole moment, introduced a
long time ago by Zel’dovich20. For a simple interpretation in terms of chiral mag-
netization of the nucleus the reader is referred to21. Explicit calculations have been
performed for cesium by the Novosibirsk22 and Paris23 groups. It is interesting to
note that the eﬀect of the electron-nucleus Z0 exchange associated with an axial-
vector coupling to the nucleons, also involving the nuclear spin, is formally identical
but about ﬁve times smaller.

In 1997 precision measurements of Im Epv

1 /β on the two hyperﬁne lines

∆F =
polarized atomic beam that crosses an optical power build-up cavity resonant for the

larly to the angular momentum, ξk, of the resonant light beam. The pseudo-scalar
quantity which manifests PVis the mixed product: E

appear in the transition rate of single Zeeman components of the transition. One
monitors a change in the ground state population induced during passage through
the interaction region which is correlated with the parameter reversals. Combin-

A deviation between experiment and theory of 1.13 = 2.6 σ was concluded. The
existence of an extra neutral gauge boson27, whose mass lies in the range hundreds
of GeV, was invoked as a possible interpretation in terms of ”new physics” beyond
the Standard Model, that did not contradict high energy physics results.

4. New activity in the ﬁeld

4.1. Atomic theory
The 0.4% theoretical uncertainty assigned on Qexp
W by the Bouder group raised
questions about small corrections to the prediction neglected so far. This prompted
several theoretical groups to reconsider the problem.

A. Derevianko28 was the ﬁrst to evaluate the Breit correction (the magnetic
interaction between all electrons) and to announce a non-negligible correction to
0.6%, rapidly conﬁrmed by other groups29,30. The eﬀect of a diﬀerence

Theorists of relativistic many-body calculations have reﬁned their calculations
and still agree on the result within a 1% level of precision29,34,30, with a precision of
0.5%30 being claimed. In addition, the last calculations now include the contribution
of self-energy and vertex QED radiative corrections35,36 found to be non-negligible

In spite of this apparently perfect agreement with the SM, we would like to

somewhat too early to consider such an agreement as deﬁnitely well established.

the atomic factor but also Qth

calculation incorporating all corrections to the parity violating electron-nucleus

4.2. A novel experimental approach: APV measured in Cs using
stimulated-emission detection and asymmetry ampliﬁcation

→

7S1/2−

Our new experiment currently performed on the Cs 6S
7S transition diﬀers rad-
ically from both our ﬁrst 82-83 experiment18 and the Boulder experiment2. While
all APV experiments on highly forbidden transitions in a Stark ﬁeld have used so far
the detection of ﬂuorescence signals, this experiment exploits the possibilities of the
6P3/2 in interaction with two copropagating
Λ-type three-level system 6S1/2−
lasers. One intense laser with linear polarization ˆǫex excites the forbidden transition
in a longitudinal E ﬁeld and the second laser probes the angular anisotropy induced
in the excited state. The probe laser is ampliﬁed and its linear polarization ˆǫpr is al-
tered. A precise analysis of the polarization change is performed on the transmitted
beam. In order to provide suitable conditions for PV measurements, a large gain for
the probe has to be achieved, hence the realization of this experiment with a pulsed
excitation laser and a gated probe. The left-right asymmetry is a rotation of the
linear polarization of the probe ˆǫpr, which can be measured at each laser pulse with
a dual-channel polarimeter operating in balanced mode (see Fig. 2). The eﬀect is

This chiral optical gain can be understood on the basis of simple symmetry con-
siderations. The excitation polarization ˆǫex and the E ﬁeld determine two symmetry
planes for the experiment. Without parity violation one would expect the excited
Cs vapor to have its optical axes contained in those planes. If this were the case, a
ˆǫex would pass through the vapor without
probe beam linearly polarized with ˆǫpr k
alteration of its polarization. Actually, due to parity violation acting during the ex-
citation process, the optical axes of the excited vapor are tilted with respect to the
10−6 rad, odd
symmetry planes and it is this tiny tilt angle θpv =
under E-reversal, which has to be determined. As a consequence of this tilt, while

the probe beam passes through the vapor its polarization rotates towards the axis
of larger gain. This causes an imbalance at the output of the polarimeter, odd in
E-reversal, which is measured. It is precisely calibrated by measuring the imbalance
induced by a small precisely known tilt of ˆǫex, in identical conditions.

An attractive feature of this experiment is that the left-right asymmetry itself,
ALR, is ampliﬁed while the probe propagates through the optically thick vapor.
Therefore, instead of being a decreasing function of the applied ﬁeld as in usual ﬂu-
orescence experiments, ALR is transformed by stimulated-emission detection into
40. Another conceptual diﬀerence with the Boulder
an increasing function of

experiment is that the detected observable is directly the asymmetry itself as op-
10−6 in the total transition rate, correlated
posed to a modulation of order 6
with parameter reversals. Moreover, the present approach avoids the diﬃculty met
there regarding systematics associated with M1 interference eﬀects and line-shape
dependent eﬀects. Another attractive feature is the cylindrical symmetry exhibited
by the experiment: the signal is expected to remain invariant under simultaneous
rotations of the laser beam polarizations ˆǫex, ˆǫpr about the common beam direc-
tion. This feature enables us to discriminate against possible systematics arising
from stray transverse ﬁelds and misalignments41.

×

However, the observation of the PV chiral optical gain remains an experimental
challenge42. For instance, detection has to be restricted to the
20 ns time interval
during which the pulse excited vapor acts as an ampliﬁer. This is achieved using a
fast optical switch on the probe laser beam, with severe requirement with respect

to its extinction ratio43. Among several other unusual problems to be solved, there
was the generation of a pulsed longitudinal uniform E ﬁeld of 2kV/cm inside a 8-cm
long Cs vapor cell at the useful atomic density and submitted to intense laser light
pulses. One key-element here was provided by the all-sapphire so-called ”grooved”
cells, ﬁnally upgraded with high optical quality metal coated windows. An original
trick to enhance the signal has been the use of a polarization-tilt magniﬁer.

level of sensitivity is now adequate for a one-to-two percent QW -precision objective.
There is still room for improvement by boosting the ampliﬁcation phenomenon, for
instance in a new transverse ﬁeld geometry as we have proposed recently44. In this
proposal, a 0.1% statistical precision looks achievable.

The work reported in this section has demonstrated an original method for parity
violation measurements in a highly forbidden atomic transition oﬀering perspectives
for high precision and reliability.

4.3. Experiments in progress in other atoms and new proposals

4.3.1. Work in progress on a chain of rare earth isotopes

It has not been possible, yet, to test experimentally an important prediction of
the SM concerning the variation of QW along a string of isotopes. It has been
suggested45 that in rare earth spectra one can ﬁnd atomic states of opposite parity
which are nearly degenerate, for instance in Dy (Z=66) and Yb (Z=70) which both
oﬀer a chain of seven stable isotopes. One expects this near-degeneracy to enhance
the PV eﬀect, thus making possible precise measurements. In ﬁrst approximation,
ratios of Epv
1 amplitudes should provide ratios of the weak charges, without invoking
atomic physics calculations46, made complex by conﬁguration mixings.

The search in Yb, conducted in Berkeley47, presents analogies with that per-
formed in Cs. The spectrum of this atom is much simpler than that of other rare
earth atoms, so that the theoretical predictions should be more reliable. In the
chosen transition, Epv
is predicted to be 100 times larger than in Cs. Important
1
exploratory work has already been carried out and the M1 amplitude of this highly
forbidden transition has already been measured48.

4.3.2. Prospects with cooled and trapped atoms

Cooling and trapping techniques open the way to measurements with radioactive
cesium isotopes or even francium atoms. With Z=87, Fr is expected to lead to PV
eﬀects 18 times larger than Cs (Z 3 law and relativistic eﬀects3,
3.1). In addition,
Fr has many isotopes.

§

Fr atoms, either obtained from a radioactive source or produced on-line by an
accelerated ion beam colliding a target, are produced at a limited rate with a su-
perthermal velocity distribution. The ﬁrst prerequisite is to avoid their spreading
out in space and loss inside the wall. Successive attempts to load Fr atoms in a
neutral atom trap have already made possible the observation of several Fr allowed
transitions, leading to precise spectroscopic measurements49,50. In our opinion, the
observation of the forbidden 6S
7S line with a sample of cold Cs atoms would
represent an important preliminary step to assess the feasibility of a PV measure-
ment in the Fr 7S

8S forbidden transition (for a deﬁnite proposal, see51).

4.3.3. Static manifestations of the electroweak interaction
When an atom is placed in a chiral environment, Sandars’ theorem52 no longer holds
and Parity Violation can manifest itself by an energy shift of its atomic levels in spite
of T-invariance. Although shifts of this kind still require considerable experimental
eﬀorts to be detected, their existence presents undoubted conceptual interest.

For chiral molecules one expects a small energy shift between the two mirror-
image enantiomers. It has been searched for by comparing vibrational frequencies
of the right and left-handed species of CHFClBr molecules53. Experiments in more
favorable conditions are in progress.

When Cs atoms are trapped in a solid matrix of 4He of hexagonal symmetry,
two applied E and B static ﬁelds and the crystal axis ˆn create a chiral environment
around each atom. In these conditions, a linear Stark shift proportional to the Cs
E)/B2
nuclear anapole moment and to the (T-even) P-odd pseudoscalar (ˆn
has been predicted54.

Both eﬀects could provide a static manifestation of the electroweak interaction,

which is still missing.

5. Relevance of Atomic Parity Violation today
The main goal of Atomic Parity Violation3 is to provide a determination of the weak
nuclear charge QW , from the measurement of Epv
1 via an atomic physics calculation
which now aims at 0.1% precision in cesium55. In view of present and forthcoming
results from high energy experiments, an important issue concerns the relevance of
further improving diﬃcult experiments such as APV measurements. We would like
to present arguments in favor of small scale APV experiments.

(i) First we wish to reiterate that APV experiments explore the electroweak (EW)
electron-hadron interaction within a range of low momentum transfers qat of
1 MeV or there abouts in cesium, as opposed to the huge ones explored in
collider experiments: 100 GeV at LEP I and LEP II and 1 TeV at LHC. To
obtain relevant information, one has to approach an absolute precision of 10−8
in the measurement of a radiative atomic transition left-right asymmetry.

(ii) For qat ∼

1 MeV, the quarks of the atomic nucleus act coherently, while at high
energies the nucleons are broken into their fundamental constituants: the quarks
act then incoherently. This is what happens in deep inelastic electron-nucleon
scattering, such as the SLAC experiment56 involving a GeV polarized electron
beam colliding against a ﬁxed deuterium target. As a consequence, diﬀerent
combinations of electron-quark PV coupling constants are involved in the LR
asymmetries of the two experiments: 2
at high energies instead
of (2Z + N )C(1)
for QW . It is easily seen that, in a model-
independent analysis, the two experiments delimit nearly orthogonal allowed
bands in the [C(1)
(iii) The fact that qat ∼

light extra neutral gauge boson, for instance with a mass in the range of a few
MeV. Such a drastic modiﬁcation of EW interactions appears as an alternative
explanation for the remarkably intense and narrow gamma ray line emitted
from the bulge of our galaxy, close to the energy of 511 keV which coincides
with the electron mass57,58. According to this somewhat exotic model, the
observed spectrum would result from the annihilation of two light dark matter
1-2 MeV) into a pair (e+, e−) via the exchange of a light
particles (mass
gauge boson U, with a mass of about 10 MeV59. In order to reproduce the size
of the observed eﬀect, one has to exclude at a large conﬁdence level an axial
coupling of the electrons to the new U boson, while such a coupling is the only
possible one for dark particles which carry no charge. This is where APV comes
into play.
The most plausible conclusion to which the present value24 of ∆QW leads is
that the U boson couples to the electron as a vector particle with no axial
coupling at the 10−6 level, while its vector coupling to leptons and quarks
are of the same order of magnitude60. Thus, the APV measurements provide
an empirical justiﬁcation for a key-hypothesis, introduced in the astrophysical
model accounting for the 511 keV galactic line.

W from the SM prediction, are most often analyzed in
the framework of ”new physics” models which aﬀect EW interactions at energies
higher than MZ0c2 through the existence of gauge bosons heavier than the Z0,
such as for instance Kaluza-Klein excitations of the SM gauge bosons61. It
turns out that ∆QW is proportional to the same factor X = π
Z0 as the
deviations from the SM in existing collider experiments, provided that q2R2
k ≪
1 TeV−1 stands for the compactiﬁcation radius associated with
1, where Rk ≤
the additional dk dimensions of the new physical space for EW gauge ﬁelds. A
determination of ∆QW below the 0.1 % level of precision would give constraints
on Rk, competitive with those of LEP II62,63,64. Furthermore, one can consider
models which predict eﬀects undetectable by LEP II results but that would be
visible in APV experiments62,65. Therefore, a 0.1% accurate determination of

(iv) Deviations ∆QW of Qexp

In view of the present need for further measurements, underlined above, there
are strong incentives to pursue APV measurements in Cs by stimulated-emission
detection and to push further the technologies opening the path to novel-type ex-
periments, both in cold radioactive atoms and chains of rare earth isotopes. We ﬁnd
it remarkable that results of APV experiments that involve scattering photons, of
only a few eV, by a sample of a few cubic centimeters of dilute atomic vapor, can
stand comparison with experiments performed in colliders of the highest energy, for
providing a lower limit on the mass of a hypothetical additional neutral boson.

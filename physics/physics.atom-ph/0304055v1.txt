CTMC electron transfer total and partial cross sections between simple ions using
classical basis functions

In this work we present a recipe to generate stationary classical spatial distributions for electrons
for arbitrary levels, patterned after the works [Hardie D J W and Olson R E 1983 J Phys B: At Mol
Phys 16 1983] and [Cohen J S 1985 J Phys B: At Mol Phys 18 1759]. It provides a compact way
of producing quantum-like classical wavefunctions in ordinary and momentum spaces. The same
recipe is used to analyze the output of CTMC simulations for electron transfer between simple ions:
It yields an alternative for the estimate of partial cross section for capture into quantum energy
levels to the standard method of Becker and MacKellar [Becker R L and MacKellar A D 1984 J
Phys B: At Mol Phys 17 3923] .

INTRODUCTION

The Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) method is the workhorse among the computational tools for mod-
elling heavy particles collisions with electron transfer, due to its simplicity of implementation, accuracy and wide
range of applicability.
Along the years, several attempts have been made to improve from the original version of the method [1] and to get
even more accurate results. The CTMC method is made of three steps: 1) the choice of the initial conditions; 2) the
solving of the dynamical equations; 3) the determination of the ﬁnal conﬁguration. Giving an accurate recipe for all
of the three steps in problems involving several electrons and/or non-hydrogenlike ions, is a tremendously complicated
matter, far from being fully solved. Dealing only with hydrogenlike and fully stripped ions removes complications
related to point (2), since the interparticle forces are exactly known, but still leaves some open questions relating to
points (1) and (3). The problems arise from the well known fact that it is not possible to devise classical statistical
distributions that exactly match the corresponding quantum-mechanical ones for all of the phase space variables.
The original choice, and still the most commonly adopted, is to pick up initial conditions from a microcanonical
ensemble. This allows matching exactly quantum mechanical energy and momentum distribution, at the expense of
a poor spatial distribution. This choice is based on the idea that it is the velocity matching between electron and
projectile nucleus, more than the spatial overlap between the trajectories, to determine the output of the simulation.
It has the further advantage, from the numerical point of view, that microcanonical distributions are, by construction,
stationary under the potential of the target nucleus.
However, the concern about the deﬁcient description of large-impact-parameter collisions, which is unavoidable within
this picture, led several researchers to devise more eﬃcient strategies, able to accurately reproduce even the spatial
distribution. Accurate statistical distributions can be useful even for semiclassical variants of the CTMC method (see
[2] ).
We refer here to the works by Eichenauer et al.
[3], where the (truncated) Wigner function was used; to Hardie
and Olson [4] which adopted a linear combination of microcanonical spatial distributions corresponding to diﬀerent
binding energies. Explicitly, they wrote

value of E). The weights wi and the energies Ei were chosen empirically to get a good representation of the hydrogen
1s orbital.
Both approaches were encompassed within Cohen’s formulation [5]: Cohen supposed that the phase space distribution
function could be written in terms of just the binding energy: ̺(r, p)
f (E). This conditional probability can be
integrated over either of the variables r, p to get the probability distribution function (PDF) for the other variable.
In particular,

≡

̺(r, p)dp = ρ(r) .

Z

Cohen imposed the rhs to be equal to its quantum mechanical value and, by inverting the integral equation, found
f (E) (Eq. 13 in Cohen’s paper, see ﬁg. 1). Cohen, indeed, showed that the empirically truncated Wigner function
used in [3] shares most of its essential features with his exact result. We will show later that the same is true for the
Hardie and Olson’s approach.
Following Cohen’s terminology, we will henceafter use the term “p-CTMC” to refer to the CTMC method when
using microcanonical distribution, and “r-CTMC” to refer to its modiﬁed versions. A common feature of all these
r-CTMC versions is that the spatial distribution is correctly recovered, and the momentum distribution quite closely
reproduced, but at some cost: ﬁrst of all, care must be exerced in insuring that the ﬁnal distribution be stationary
in absence of the projectile. This can be of concern for low-velocity collisions, where it has much time to evolve.
The second eﬀect is subtler: since the distribution of binding energies is not a Dirac delta, but is spread over a ﬁnite
support, some of the statistical runs start with electrons that are bound to the target nucleus less (or more) strongly
that allowed by Quantum Mechanics. This, of course, has consequences on the integrated results (total cross sections),
as shown in Cohen’s work. But some further subtle eﬀects arise when one looks for diﬀerential results, such as partial
cross sections for capture into selected quantum levels. Indeed, the standard procedure for identifying capture into a
given quantum level is the binning procedure by Becker and MacKellar [6] : the classical values are “quantized” into
speciﬁc n levels according to

with nc = Zp/√2U, and Zp, U are the projectile charge and the electron binding energy to the projectile, respectively.
(For more detailed analysis, similar relations have been written for angular quantum numbers, too, but we will not
consider them here). This procedure has been recently modiﬁed to be more accurate when dealing with non hydrogen-
like atoms [7, 8]. While well suited for p-CTMC, this binning procedure is not consistent with r-CTMC. One can easily
be convinced of this by applying eq. (4) to the initial electron distribution (ﬁg. 1): he would get electrons spread over
several n levels (indeed, over all of them, although their population will be not negligible only over a few), instead
than all into a single energy level. The same is expected to happen for captured electrons: those randomly chosen
with a large binding energy will probably populate lower n levels than should be allowed to do (and the converse will
be true for those picked from the low-energy part of the distribution). But it should be clear that this eﬀect is not
a consequence of the stochasticity intrinsinc to the CTMC method, mimicking the quantum mechanical randomness;
instead is an artifact due to our inconsistent method of binning.
In this work we present a slightly diﬀerent method of generating the initial distribution. In itself, it cannot by no
means be considered a novel method:
indeed it is patterned after Hardie and Olson’s, and tailored to closely ﬁt
Cohen’s formula, so that it can be seen as to give a simpliﬁed expression for this latter one. However, we think that
it enjoys some advantages over these two methods. It shares with Cohen’s method the deﬁnition of a PDF for having
the electron bound with a given energy, p(E), closely related to Cohen’s f (E). However, the wavefunction is still built
from a linear combination of microcanonical wavefunctions, hence its stationarity is automatically assured. The real
conceptual novelty in the work, however, is that p(E) is used to identify not only initial distributions, but also ﬁnal
ones. This provides a diﬀerent method to assign probabilities for capture into selected states. Results are compared
against quantum methods and standard CTMC runs using Eq. (4), and found to be encouraging. Besides this main
point, the present method enjoys another minor advantage in that it is able to provide a simple alghoritm to generate
spatial PDF for ground and (albeit with decreasing accuracy) excited states.

II. THE METHOD

We start with a continuous version of Hardie and Olson’s method, that is, suppose that the spatial PDF can be

given by a weighted average of microcanonical PDFs over the binding energy:

ρ(r) =

dEp(E)ρµ(r, E) .

Of course, the integration runs only over the ﬁnite support of ρµ (Eq. 2).
By comparing (5) with Cohen’s deﬁnition for f (E) (Eq. 13) or ̺(E) (Eq. 16) , and using Eq. (2) , it is clear that
the two are related by

apart for unimportant normalization constants. For p(E) we choose an inverse gamma distribution:

In order to give a value to β, ν, it is convenient to compute the ﬁrst moments of this distribution:

for which simple expressions are found:

(In the second expression, the exact analytical dependence from ν has been replaced with a simpler but very accurate
power-law dependence). We replace into the lhs’s of previous equations the exact quantum mechanical values:

With this choice, we catch the main features of the wavefunctions. About the other statistical quantities of interest,
we notice that the average energy is also computable analytically:

By inserting into this equation the values of β, ν as found from the previous equations, it is possible to see that
it approximates rather well that the quantum value E = Z 2/(2n2) . In ﬁgure (1) we plot p(E) for values of the
parameters corresponding to the ground state of hydrogen atom, together with the Cohen’s ̺(E) function.
It is
apparent how the two curves closely ﬁt. This yields the justiﬁcation a posteriori for our choice of the form of the
PDF p(E). We have overplotted also the empirical coeﬃcients found by Hardie and Olson. It is clear that what they
had done was essentially a discretization of p(E).

The classical wavefunctions for (n, l) = (1, 0) and (n, l) = (2, 1) are plotted in ﬁgs. (2, 3). The ground state is nicely
reproduced; not so well, instead, the excited one, but we must remind that, by construction, we are sure that the two
ﬁrst moments of the wavefunction are exactly reproduced. This means that-even increasing the quantum number-our
ﬁtting procedure cannot degradate indeﬁnitely.

With this we are done for the part concerning the generation of initial distributions. The practical recipe to generate
a stationary spatial distribution corresponding to a quantum state (Z, n, l)is therefore: ﬁrst, the parameters β, ν are
evaluated from eqns. (10-13); second, a value E0 of the binding energy and using the just computed β, ν is randomly

picked up from the distribution p(E) (7); ﬁnally, electron coordinates are chosen with standard methods from the
stationary microcanonical distribution ρµ(r, E0).
Let us now try to export this simple recipe to the study of the PDF fcap(E) of captured electrons. If we could expect
our system to follow “quantum-mechanics-like” prescriptions, fcap(E) should be a linear combinations of functions
p(E):

fcap =

cβ,νpβ,ν(E) ,

Xβ,ν

Probcap(n, l) = cβ,ν.

and the indices β, ν were exactly those corresponding to the projectile’s quantum levels, according to eqns. (10-13).
In this case the fraction of capture into each level would most simply be:

Of course, such an outcome is extremely unlikely, since our system follows classical rules. Therefore we must implement
a discretization procedure, comparable to that of Eq. (4). Here, we exploit the property of the functions (7) of being
well localized (see, e.g. ﬁg. 1). This means that we can try to use them as “basis functions” for decomposing fcap
and write an expression of the form (15) where, now, the parameters β, ν are no longer preassigned, but instead are
computed as ﬁtting coeﬃcients. The expression “basis function” should be, of course, be understood as rather loose,
since these functions are not orthogonal to each other. Each basis function is thus assigned to an energy level. This
can be done, by example, by computing the average energy for each basis function (Eq. 14), and assigning the whole
PDF to the quantum level nearest in energy to < E >β,ν. The fraction of captures into that level will be therefore
given by (16).

III. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES

→

The system H(1s) + He2+

H+ + He+(n,l) is ideal to test this approach: it is well documented in literature, and
the capture to helium occurs into few levels, thus making manageable the decomposition (15). In ﬁg. (4) we plot the
total cross section for this process, computed using a CTMC code ad hoc developed according to the above guidelines,
thus comparing our results with those already present in literature: a full quantum mechanical molecular approach
[9], a diﬀerent classical method [10], and a standard p-CTMC computation [11]. Our CTMC results underestimate
the correct value of σ for impact velocity v < 1, but this is a well known deﬁciency of CTMC methods. More relevant
is the perfect agreement between our CTMC results and Olson’s one at v = √2, which gives conﬁdence about our
correct implementation of the code. (The fact that the two results are obtained using r- and p-CTMC models is of
no concern here. Cohen already showed that the diﬀerencies between the two approaches disappear at high v).

The best way to understand the present approach is by looking at ﬁg. (5): here, we have plotted the number
of captures per energy unit at ﬁxed energy. Using standard routines, the CTMC data have been ﬁtted to a linear
combination of three curves (7), whose parameters are given in table I.

About 10% of the curve falls into the region labelled as “n = 1”. With the standard binning procedure, these
capures would be assigned to the He+(1s) state. We will show that, instead, with the present method, no captures
are assigned to this state.
Now, we proceed by assigning the fraction of captures due to each component to the quantum energy level whose
principal number n is closest to the estimated eﬀective quantum number neq: the results are listed in table II for
some values of the impact velocity v and together with estimates from the other models. We have added a point also
for H(1s) + Be4+ collisions.

Esentially, the present algorithm “drains” captures from the lowest and highest levels, where the naive binning
argument would have been placed them. The results are in rough accordance with those found using a quantum
mechanical molecular approach, that should be more reliable in this velocity range.

When v increases, ionization begins to appear. The curve dN/dE does not go to zero any longer as E

0, but
crosses the axis E = 0 at a ﬁnite value (corresponding to a ﬁnite fraction of captures into unbound states with E < 0).
Fitting this curve becomes increasingly diﬃcult since a larger and larger number of basis function would be needed.
An example is shown in ﬁg. (6), where the equivalent of ﬁg. (5) is displayed, but computed at an impact velocity
v = √2. In order for the ﬁtting routine to converge, the experimental curve had to be artiﬁcially truncated below
E = 0.025.

→

By contrast, as long as ionization can be neglected, even more highly charged ions can be dealt with satisfactorily:

in ﬁg. (7) we see that the ﬁtting of the captures H(1s) , Be4+

Be3+ is fairly good.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

This work consists of two parts: the ﬁrst is trivial in itself, since simply provides an approximate form for the
function found by Cohen. However, it is important since yields a compact analytical expression for the function (7)
which behaves as a sort of basis function for the classical wavefunctions, in the same way as Laguerre functions are
for the quantum problem.
Also, we do not claim we have found a breackthrough in this ﬁeld: indeed, the procedure of ﬁtting the energy PDF
of captures, although not diﬃcult, is competitive with the Becker and MacKellar’s one (4) only when the number of

basis functions is small. However, we have not carried on a devoted study trying to optimize this aspect, for which
some expedients seem viable. For example, it might be convenient to bin the captures in function of 1/E instead of
E. Notwithstanding this, the procedure suggested seems interesting and perhaps deserves further study.

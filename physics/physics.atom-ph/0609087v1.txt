Abstract
An experiment is proposed to excite the ‘forbidden’ 1s2s 3S1 - 1s2s 1S0 magnetic dipole (M1)

transition at 1.557 µm in a collimated and slow atomic beam of metastable helium atoms. It is
demonstrated that an excitation rate of 5000 s−1 can be realised with the beam of a 2 W narrowband

telecom ﬁber laser intersecting the atomic beam perpendicularly. A Doppler-limited sub-MHz

spectroscopic linewidth is anticipated. Doppler-free excitation of 2% of trapped and cooled atoms

may be realised in a one-dimensional optical lattice geometry, using the 2 W laser both for trapping

and spectroscopy. The very small (8 Hz) natural linewidth of this transition presents an opportunity
for accurate tests of atomic structure calculations of the helium atom. A measurement of the 3He
- 4He isotope shift allows for accurate determination of the diﬀerence in nuclear charge radius of

both isotopes.

INTRODUCTION

Measurements of level energies of low-lying states in helium provide very sensitive tests

of basic theory of atomic structure. Although helium is a two-electron system, energy levels

of the nonrelativistic helium atom can be calculated with a precision that is, for all practical

purposes, as good as for nonrelativistic hydrogen. Relativistic corrections to these energies

can be calculated in a power series of the ﬁne structure constant α and have been calculated
up to O(α2). Eﬀects of the ﬁnite nuclear mass can be included in a power series of the mass

ratio µ/M, where µ is the reduced electron mass and M the nuclear mass. QED corrections,
both hydrogenic and electron-electron terms, up to O(α3) have been calculated as well.

Eﬀects of the ﬁnite nuclear size can be incorporated straightforwardly [1, 2]. Present day

theory aims at calculating higher-order corrections (in α, µ/M) and cross terms (such as

relativistic recoil). The most diﬃcult terms to date are the relativistic and QED terms of
O(α4) and higher. Higher-order corrections are largest for low-lying S-states and therefore
the most sensitive tests of atomic structure calculations can be performed for the 1 1S0
ground state and the metastable states 2 1S0 (lifetime 20 ms) and 2 3S1 (lifetime 8000 s).

Present-day laser spectroscopy on the low-lying S-states has several disadvantages. To ex-

tract an experimental value for the ionisation energy of these states the transition frequency

to a high-lying state has to be accurately measured and one has to rely on theoretical values

of the ionisation energy of the upper state in the transition. Here the lifetime of the upper

state and line shifts due to stray electric ﬁelds and laser power are limiting factors. For the
ground state, excitation is diﬃcult: one photon of 58 nm is required to excite the 2 1P1 state
[3] or two photons of 120 nm to excite the 2 1S0 state [4]. For the 2 1S0 and 2 3S1 metastable
states CW laser light is used to excite with one photon the 2 3P [5], 3 3P [6, 7] and n 1P [8]
states. Two-photon spectroscopy is applied to excite the 3 3D state [9] and n 1D states [10].
2 3P0

The most accurate transition frequency measurement to date is for the 2 3S1

→

transition [5], with an absolute accuracy of 4 kHz. This measurement, however, does not
provide an accurate measurement of the 2 3S1 ionisation energy as the 2 3P0 ionisation energy

is not known well enough. Moreover, recent measurements of the ﬁne structure splitting of
the 2 3P state have shown that experiment and theory do not agree at the 10 kHz level [11].

This very recent ﬁnding is considered an outstanding problem of bound state QED and asks

for independent measurements on other transitions with similar accuracy. Experimental

2

accuracies for the ionisation energy of the 2 1S0 and 2 3S1 states, deduced from measurements

to highly excited states and relying on the theoretical calculations of the ionisation energies

of these states, are 150 kHz and 60 kHz respectively. These values agree with but are more
accurate than present-day theory for the 2 1S0 and 2 3S1 ionisation energy, which is accurate

to 5 MHz [12] and 1 MHz [13] respectively. The theoretical accuracies represent the estimated

magnitude of uncalculated higher-order terms in QED calculations.

QED shifts largely cancel when identical transitions in diﬀerent isotopes are studied.

Measuring the isotope shift, the main theoretical inaccuracy is in the diﬀerence in the rms
charge radius of the nuclei [14, 15]. As the charge radius of the 4He nucleus is the most

accurately known of all nuclei (including the proton) isotope shifts measure the charge radius
of the other isotope involved. In this way accurate determination of the 2 3S1 - 2 3P transition
isotope shift have allowed accurate measurements of the charge radius of 3He [15, 16] and
the unstable isotope 6He [17], challenging nuclear physics calculations. It has to be noted,
however, that the measurement of the 4He nuclear radius has sofar not been reproduced

[15]. These measurements therefore primarily measure diﬀerences in charge radius.

Elaborating on an idea of Baklanov and Denisov [18] we propose direct laser excitation of
2 1S0 transition in a slow atomic beam or in an optical lattice. This transition

the 2 3S1

→

has the advantage of an intrinsically narrow natural linewidth of 8 Hz and a wavelength of

1.557 µm. Also, as the transition connects two states of the same 1s2s conﬁguration, the

theoretical error in the transition frequency may be smaller than the error in the ionisation

energy of the individual states [19]. The main disadvantage is that the transition is extremely

weak; the Einstein A-coeﬃcient for this magnetic dipole (M1) transition is 14 orders of
2 3P transition. In this paper
magnitude smaller than for the electric dipole (E1) 2 3S1

→

we show that with 2 W of a narrowband ﬁber laser at 1.557 µm we can excite more than 1
in 107 atoms in an atomic beam experiment or more than 1% of atoms trapped in a one-

dimensional standing light wave. Present-day sources of metastable helium atoms [20] easily

provide suﬃcient atoms in either an atomic beam or in a trap to observe the transition.

In order to evaluate the feasibility of detecting the transition, we need to choose an

experimental conﬁguration. Several approaches can be considered [25]: spectroscopy in a

discharge cell, on a thermal or laser-cooled beam, on a cold cloud in a magnetic or optical

trap, and ultimately spectroscopy on atoms in an optical lattice. Here, we ﬁrst consider a

relatively simple but promising setup: spectroscopy on a laser-cooled and collimated beam

as produced on a daily basis in groups working on BEC in metastable helium [20].

BLOCH EQUATIONS MODEL

In order to describe the excitation of the 2 3S1

2 1S0 magnetic dipole transition, we

→

use a simpliﬁed set of optical Bloch equations (OBE’s). The decay rate of the upper level
is fully dominated by the two-photon (2E1) decay to the ground state: Γ2 = 51 s−1 [24].

Fig. 1 summarizes the relevant decay rates. The driven Rabi frequency of the transition

(with atomic frequency ω21) is denoted by Ω, the detuning by ∆ = ωlaser

ω21.

ﬁxed irradiance I0 and a statistical probability distribution P (ω) for the frequency. The dis-

tribution is assumed to be Gaussian, centered at the transition frequency ω21 and with an rms

and is transversely cooled to an rms velocity spread of twice the Doppler limit for the He∗

prepare the atomic beam. Thus, we can expect a workable signal.

The spectroscopic linewidth of 400 kHz is dominated by the Doppler width. Decreasing

ing the spectroscopic linewidth. The limiting homogeneous linewidth is given by the 10 kHz

interaction time broadening. Applying multiple crossings of laser– and atomic beam using

roof-top prisms will not only increase the signal proportionally, but also decrease the inter-

action time broadening. As a bonus, possible Doppler shifts due to nonorthogonal excitation

can be monitored and minimised in this conﬁguration. A schematic view of the proposed

setup, with three crossings depicted, is shown in Fig. 2.

EXPERIMENT IN AN OPTICAL LATTICE

The 1.557 µm wavelength of the forbidden transition can also serve well to form a far
oﬀ-resonance optical trap (FORT) for the 2 3S1 atoms. The dynamic polarisability at this
2 3P2 transition that is
wavelength is fully dominated by the contribution of the 2 3S1

→

resonant at 1.083 µm. This can be used in a next-generation spectroscopy experiment. As

the trapping potential is fully insensitive to the wavelength on the scale of a spectroscopic

scan of the forbidden transition, a single laser can be simultaneously used for trapping

and spectroscopy. We propose using a cold atomic cloud and transferring this cloud to a

one-dimensional optical dipole trap formed by a single retroreﬂected laser beam.

We assume 5

107 atoms in a cloud with rms size 68 µm (radial) by 340 µm (axial) at

stable 2 Watt ﬁber laser with a linewidth of 10 kHz. The trapping/spectroscopy laser beam,

directed along the long axis of the cigar-shaped cloud, has a waist radius of 136 µm. This

produces a trapping dipole potential with a maximum depth of 24.4 µK, to which the full

cloud can be transferred. Analysis of this trap indicates that roughly half the atoms end up

7

in the lowest vibrational state of the standing wave “micro-traps” along the laser beam axis.

This will eﬀectively cause a strong Doppler-free part in the spectroscopic signal by Lamb-

where the extra factor of two is due to the fact that the atoms are now trapped at the

as the Rabi frequency is high we can easily choose the excitation to last a time t satisfying

have to be detected. In an experiment, the trapping/excitation laser can be set oﬀ-resonance

for trapping, and switched to the frequency of the forbidden transition to excite the atoms
to the 2 1S0 state. We can then detect the excited atoms by photoionisation after a few

milliseconds of excitation (adjusting the geometry of the ionisation laser beam to ionise all
2 1S0 atoms expelled from the trap).

An alternative detection option is simply by measuring the increased Penning ionisation
that we expect when atoms are excited. The excited 2 1S0 atoms can also decay through
Penning ionisation in collisions with the 2 3S1 atoms. We assume the rate constant of this
process to be 10−10 cm3s−1, i.e., on the order of the rate constant for Penning ionisation of
unpolarised atoms in the 2 3S1 state [27]. This results in a decay rate of ΓP I = 100 s−1, lead-

ing to a homogeneous broadening of the transition with this value. However, as the dipole
shift of the excited 2 1S0 state has opposite sign, the excited atoms are anti-trapped and
escape the cloud of 2 3S1 atoms in τesc
0.3 ms. Then Penning ionisation stops, eﬀectively
reducing the total 2 1S0 ionisation rate by a factor of 30 as compared to the case of perfect

≈

overlap.

As the Doppler width is eﬀectively eliminated by Lamb-Dicke narrowing, the linewidth

is now determined by the laser linewidth. As this width can be further reduced, ultimately

the limiting factor will be simply the upper level decay rate.

However, systematic shifts of the transition frequency will have to be carefully considered

and corrected for. The largest shift is caused by the diﬀerence in dipole shift between

the lower and upper level of the transition and amounts to 2.0 MHz for the chosen lattice

parameters. In optical lattice experiments aiming at optical frequency standards one selects

a lattice laser wavelength at which the Stark shift of the lower state equals the Stark shift

8

of the upper state (the ‘magic’ wavelength). For helium there is no practical wavelength

available. The highest magic wavelengths are around 410 nm, where (accidentally) the dipole

shift itself is so small that no lattice is feasible at reasonable laser power, and at 351 nm,

where the polarisability is 15 times smaller than at 1.557 µm and the sign is such that

the atoms cannot be conﬁned at antinodes. At 1.557 µm, combining measurements of the

transition frequency at diﬀerent laser intensities with careful calculations of the intensity-

dependent dipole shift will still allow for very accurate extrapolation to zero Stark shift.

Collisional shifts, vanishingly small in the beam experiment, may contribute as well in

the lattice experiment. For fermions this shift will be absent at the temperatures considered.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The beam and lattice experiment both promise signal strengths and linewidths that

should make a measurement with 1 kHz resolution possible. Improvements beyond this level

also seem feasible. Standard frequency comb technology easily allows an absolute frequency

measurement at this accuracy. A ﬁber-laser based frequency comb around 1.5 µm or a

titanium-sapphire laser based frequency comb (after frequency doubling) may be used for

this purpose.

The main obstacles to be overcome are the residual Doppler linewidth for the beam

experiment and the dipole and collisional shifts for the lattice experiment. Another factor

to be considered in both experiments is the Zeeman shift due to a stray magnetic ﬁeld. A
M = 0 transition. For 4He, this can be achieved by
solution is to measure only an M = 0
simply exciting with linearly polarised light. For 3He, it will be important to shield stray

test? In a recent paper Morton, Wu and Drake [12] have tabulated the most up-to-date
experimental and theoretical ionisation energies, both for 4He and 3He. The theoretical
uncertainties for the 2 3S1 and 2 1S0 states are larger than the experimental error for 4He

for both states. Experiment and theory agree to well within the error bars.

It may be

expected that the theoretical error in the 1.557 µm transition frequency will be smaller than

the quadratic sum of the errors in the ionisation energy of the metastable states due to
cancellation eﬀects [19]. Therefore, a measurement of the 2 3S1 - 2 1S0 transition frequency

9

will not only provide a direct and accurate link between the ortho (triplet) and para (singlet)

helium system but will also test QED calculations more stringently than the existing data.

The isotope shift can be calculated with very high accuracy. Using the most recent

values for the nuclear masses and the most recent evaluation of the diﬀerence in the square
of the nuclear charge radii, i.e., 1.0594(26) fm2 [15, 16], we deduce a theoretical transition

isotope shift of 8034.3712(9) MHz. A measurement of the isotope shift thus provides a very

sensitive test of theory. It may also be interpreted as a measurement of the diﬀerence in
nuclear charge radius of 4He and 3He. A measurement at the 1 kHz level will provide this

diﬀerence with an accuracy of 0.001 fm [14], similar to the accuracy obtained from isotope
shift measurements on the 2 3S1 - 2 3P transition. These have been performed with

5 kHz

∼

accuracy [15, 16], limited by the 1.6 MHz natural linewidth of that transition. The 8 Hz

natural linewidth of the 1.557 µm transition and the possibilities to improve the beam and

lattice experiment further via sub-Doppler cooling resp. uncoupling of the trapping and

spectroscopy lasers, may push the accuracy below the 1 kHz level providing new challenges

to theorists calculating ionisation energies and, in the case of the isotope shift, provide the

most accurate data on diﬀerences in nuclear charge radius and nuclear masses of the isotopes

involved.

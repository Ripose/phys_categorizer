Abstract

We have developed a quite stringent method in selectivity to ionize the low angular-
momentum (ℓ) states which lie below and above the adjacent manifold in highly
excited Rb Rydberg atoms. The method fully exploits the pulsed ﬁeld-ionization
characteristics of the manifold states in high slew-rate regime: Speciﬁcally the low ℓ
state below (above) the adjacent manifold is ﬁrstly transferred to the lowest (high-
est) state in the manifold via the adiabatic transition at the ﬁrst avoided crossing
in low slew-rate regime, and then the atoms are driven to a high electric ﬁeld for
ionization in high slew-rate regime. These extreme states of the manifold are ionized
at quite diﬀerent ﬁelds due to the tunneling process, resulting in thus the stringent
selectivity. Two manipulation schemes to realize this method actually are demon-
strated here experimentally.

One of the attractive characteristics of the Rydberg atoms is that they couple
strongly to the external electromagnetic ﬁeld[1,2]. From this property, it has
been proposed that the atoms are utilized for a single photon detector in the
microwave range[3,4] besides a number of other applications in fundamental
physics research such as the cavity quantum electrodynamics [5]. In fact the
electric dipole transition matrix elements between the states with principal
quantum number n and n ± 1 are larger with increasing n (proportional to
n2a0, where a0 is the Bohr radius) and yet the lifetime of these states is long
enough (proportional to n3 for the low ℓ (ℓ ≪ n) states) to be utilized for this
purpose. In actual schemes along this line, the Rydberg atoms, excited from
the initially prepared lower state to a upper state by absorbing microwave
photons, are selectively ionized by means of the ﬁeld ionization.

In order to utilize the Rydberg atoms as a microwave single-photon detector,
it is therefore essential to ﬁeld-ionize the lower and the upper states selectively.
In the Rydberg states with n less than 50, where the corresponding photons
are in the millimeter to sub-millimeter wave region, this selectivity is mostly
achieved by fully exploiting the adiabatic transitions in the time evolution of
atoms in the Stark map[1,2]. However this ionization scheme has increasing
diﬃculty to achieve good selectivity for the higher excited Rydberg states
because the diﬀerence in the ionization ﬁeld for these states via the adiabatic
transitions is smaller with increasing n. Moreover the non-adiabatic process
becomes dominant for the higher excited Rydberg states, thus the eﬃciency
for the selection is correspondingly reduced with this conventional scheme.

In this Letter we present a new stringent method to selectively ionize the highly
excited Rydberg atoms with n larger than 90; this new method is realized by
choosing, as the lower and the upper states, two low angular-momentum (ℓ)
states which lie below and above the adjacent manifold. The ionization paths
are then manipulated for the chosen two states in the following way. Firstly
the low l state below (above) the adjacent manifold is transferred to the lowest
(highest) state in the manifold through the ﬁrst avoided crossing with a slowly
varying (low slew-rate) pulsed electric ﬁeld. Then a pulsed ﬁeld is applied to
drive the manifold states into the ionization along the non-adiabatic paths in
the Stark structure in high slew rate regime.

The stringent selectivity in the above ionization scheme now results from the
characteristics of the ﬁeld ionization process for the manifold states as revealed
in our previous work[6]: In fact the tunneling process in the ﬁeld ionization is
increasingly the dominant process in the highly excited Rydberg atoms with
increasing n > 90 [6]. The ionization ﬁeld value with this process depends
strongly on the energy position in the split manifold states as well known in
Hydrogen atom [1,2], that is, the ionization ﬁeld value is higher in the higher
energy (bluer) state than in the lower energy (redder) state. The ionization

example, are 4.5 and 10.5 V/cm, respectively, quite large diﬀerence compared
to the case of the adiabatic transition scheme mentioned earlier. The eﬀec-
tiveness and universality of the present scheme are demonstrated here in the
highly excited Rydberg states of Rb.

Schematic diagram of the present experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. A
thermal atomic beam of Rb was introduced to the center of the ﬁeld ionization
electrodes, where the 85Rb atoms in the ground state 5s1/2 were excited to the
ns and np states through the second excited 5p3/2 state by the two-step laser
excitation. A diode laser (780 nm) and a dye laser (479 nm) with a dye of
coumarin 102 pumped by a Kr ion laser were used for the ﬁrst and second
step excitations, respectively. The polarizations of the laser lights adopted
in the present experiment are parallel and perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld
applied for the ﬁrst and the second lasers, respectively 3 .

The electrodes consist of two parallel plates of 52 mm length and 40 mm width,
the distance between them being 24 mm. A pulsed electric ﬁeld was applied
to the electrodes for the ﬁeld ionization in the present experiment. For this
purpose a sequence of voltage pulse was generated by a waveform generator

3 No appreciable change in the experimental results was observed, however, with
other conﬁgurations such as both parallel and perpendicular cases.

the electrodes. The pulse proﬁle adopted here has mainly three components,
slow (s), fast (f ) and holding (h) parts as shown in Fig. 1; the slow component
s is used for transferring the low ℓ states into the manifold states, while the fast
component f is to ionize the manifold states in high slew rate regime as will
be explained in detail later. The component h is used for an advanced pulse
proﬁle to improve and enhance the selectivity more. The pulse proﬁle adopted
for each measurement will be shown later together with the experimental data
4 .

The electrons liberated by the ﬁeld ionization were guided to a channel electron
multiplier through two ﬁne-mesh grids placed in one of the electrode plates.
Ionization signals of electrons from the channel electron multiplier were am-
pliﬁed by a preampliﬁer and a main ampliﬁer and then fed to a multichannel
scaler P7886 (FAST ComTek) after the pulse height discrimination. The ion-
ization events were counted as a function of the elapsed time from the starting
time of the ramp ﬁeld with the dwell time of 500 ps. From the correspondence
of the applied electric ﬁeld and the time bin, the observed timing spectra were
converted into the ﬁeld ionization spectra as a function of the applied electric
ﬁeld.

As the ﬁrst step for the selective ﬁeld ionization, two schemes of forward and
backward drivings for the manipulation of the ionization path were examined
experimentally;

1) forward driving scheme: Typical pulse proﬁle applied for this scheme is
shown in Fig. 2 together with the Stark structure around n = 108 manifold
for |mj| = 1/2. The Stark energy structure was calculated with the matrix
diagonalization method[9]. The relevant energy levels here are the 111s (lower)
and 111p (upper) states which are below and above the adjacent 108 manifold,
respectively, as shown in the top of the ﬁgure. In order to transfer the initially
excited s and p states into the manifold states, a linearly ramped ﬁeld is
ﬁrst applied to the atoms up to ∼ 80 mV/cm. Here the slew rate of the
applied ﬁeld is slow enough (less than 1 mV/(cm·µs)) to cause the s (p) state
transfer adiabatically to the lowest (highest) manifold state 5 . Then the atoms

4 Repetition rate of the applied pulse was typically 5 kHz. The rate does not give
any eﬀect on the experimental results and conclusion presented here, but is related
to the detection eﬃciency of the Rydberg atoms since we used cw atomic beam in
the present experiment. The detection eﬃciency depends on various experimental
factors, maximum being about 80 %.
5 Detailed slew rate dependences of the transition probabilities for the adiabatic
and non-adiabatic processes at the ﬁrst avoided crossings of the s (and also the p)
state and the adjacent manifold states were measured in a separate experiment and
compared with theoretical predictions taking into account the multilevel-crossing
eﬀect. Detailed results of these studies will be presented elsewhere.

are driven for ionization to high electric ﬁeld with the same direction to the
preceding slow component, here in this case up to 14 V/cm, with a slew rate
of 13.4 V/(cm·µs). The observed ionization spectra resulting from the applied
pulse ﬁeld are shown also in Fig. 2. As presented in detail in our previous

investigation[6], the high ﬁeld peaks in the spectra (peaks γ and β in Figs. 2d
and 2e, respectively) come from the tunneling process and the values of the
ionization ﬁeld corresponding to these peaks are quite diﬀerent. We call this
scheme forward driving scheme.

2) backward driving scheme: In Fig. 3a shown is the pulse proﬁle applied for
this scheme, where the initially applied slow component and the following fast
pulse component of the electric ﬁeld have opposite polarity. The reversed elec-
tric ﬁeld causes the atoms driven to zero ﬁeld once after the transition to the
manifold states and then driven to higher electric ﬁeld for ionization. This
reversed (backward) driving of the applied electric ﬁeld makes the ionization
path completely diﬀerent from the case of the f orward driving: In fact the
peaks due to the tunneling process for the p and s states in Figs. 3d and
3e have reversed positions to those shown in Figs. 2d and 2e in their ioniza-
tion ﬁelds. This kind of reversed driving in the ionization process has been
previously studied by Harmin[7] theoretically and also by several groups [8]
experimentally but only at lower n region. More detailed characteristics of this
backward driving scheme revealed systematically in the present experiment will
be presented elsewhere.

The above two driving schemes have diﬀerent features as revealed in the ob-
served spectra: 1) The fraction of the tunneling-process component to the total
ionization signals for the 111p state is larger in the case of backward driving, 2)
the width of the component for the 111p state in the backward driving is nar-
rower than in the forward driving. These features indicate that the backward
driving scheme is superior for the microwave single-photon detector from the
view point of the selectivity and the detection eﬃciency, although the peak
position of the tunneling-process component for the 111p state is in between
the two peaks for the 111s state.

It is also noted here that a small peak (denoted by β) observed in between
the two prominent peaks (α and γ) in Fig. 3e in the ionization spectrum of
111s state is due to the transition induced by the blackbody radiations from
the initially prepared 111s state to the neighboring p states: In fact this peak
position corresponds exactly to that observed in the excitation of the 111p
state as seen in Fig. 3d. The observed ratio (2%) of this peak component to
that of the initially excited 111s component is also in rough agreement with
the value (3%) estimated from the relevant transition rates under the actual
experimental conditions. The origin of this peak was further conﬁrmed by
introducing a microwave source into the present experimental system, where
the source frequency is tuned to the transition frequency from the 111s1/2 to
the 111p3/2 states; in Fig. 3f shown is the enhanced peak due to the eﬀect
of this microwave source 6 . Manipulating the ionization path as described

state obtained with the advanced three-step ﬁeld ionization scheme together with
those for the standard one-step scheme presented in Fig. 3. Note here that the slow

the proﬁle drawing of (a) and (c) for simplicity. (a) and (b) One-step pulse proﬁle

above was thus found to be quite eﬀective to selectively ionize the low ℓ states
below and above the adjacent manifold. However the lower peak (α) due to
the autoionization-like process is rather broad and has a tail component which
extends to the region of the peak (β) due to the blackbody induced transitions
as noted above. The extension of this tail part to the transition component
is more clearly seen in Fig. 4b where a raw timing spectrum is shown in
logarithmic scale.

forward driving scheme. This component is, however, too small to be seen clearly in
the spectrum shown in Fig. 2e because of its small relative ratio to the lower peak
from the autoionization-like process and also of its broad distribution.

8

In order to improve the selectivity further more, the applied pulse proﬁle was
modiﬁed as shown in Fig. 4c; essential modiﬁcation here is that the pulse
proﬁle at the ionization stage is divided into three parts, in each of which
the applied electric ﬁeld is held for some period before proceeding to the next
step of ionization. Each part of the pulse proﬁle is used to induce the ﬁeld
ionization corresponding to each peak observed in the previous scheme as seen
in Fig. 4b. However this division of the pulse proﬁle into three parts is not just
for dividing the ionization spectra into three in which each of the three peaks
is just included. Instead this pulse proﬁle actually enhances the separation
between the low ﬁeld ionization (portion α in Fig. 3e) of the autoionization-
like process and the following ionization related to the s - p transition (portion
β in Fig. 3e) as clariﬁed actually in Fig. 4d. This is because the ionization at
the portion α has a ﬁnite lifetime, which depends strongly on the applied
electric ﬁeld [9], and even at the lower electric ﬁeld than its peak ﬁeld, the
atoms relevant to this ionization process are ionized within the holding time
(5 µs in the present case) longer than their lifetimes. Since the ionization ﬁeld
value to be held for this part can be chosen in such a way that at this lower
ﬁeld the atoms in the upper p state are not ionized at all, the extended tail of
the lower peak α which entered into the peak region of the portion β in the
previous one-step backward driving scheme is almost completely removed out
in this new three-step scheme.

The background underneath the transition peak was thus reduced by more
than two orders of magnitude compared to the one-step scheme described
earlier. As a result the eﬀective noise temperature of this detector system,
intrinsically determined by the background contributions due to the tail con-
taminations from the initially prepared lower state, is well below 10 mK with
this scheme. Thus the present method of ﬁeld ionization detection satisﬁes
the most important requirement of low noise characteristics for a sensitive
microwave single-photon detector.

In conclusion, we have established a quite stringent method to selectively
ionize the low ℓ states which lie below and above the adjacent manifold by
properly manipulating the ionization path through the pulsed electric ﬁeld.
With more sophisticated pulse proﬁle of three steps further, which has the
holding time in between the steeply rising ﬁeld for ionization, the selectivity is
much more enhanced due to the characteristics of the ionization mechanism in
these highly excited Rydberg atoms. Two actual schemes were proposed and
experimentally demonstrated to be practical and eﬀective for this purpose. It
was shown in particular that the backward driving scheme is more eﬃcient for
the Rydberg atoms to be utilized as the microwave single photon detector.
The present method thus opens a new way to detect single microwave pho-
tons individually over the region of 10 cm wavelength with higher n Rydberg
atoms[4,10].

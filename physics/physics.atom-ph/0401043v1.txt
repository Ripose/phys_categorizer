We illuminate the importance of a self-consistent many-body treatment in calculations of vac-
uum polarization corrections to the energies of atomic orbitals in many-electron atoms. Including
vacuum polarization in the atomic Hamiltonian causes a substantial re-adjustment (relaxation) of
the electrostatic self-consistent ﬁeld. The induced change in the electrostatic energies is substantial
for states with the orbital angular momentum l > 0. For such orbitals, the relaxation mechanism
determines the sign and even the order of magnitude of the total vacuum polarization correction.
This relaxation mechanism is illustrated with numerical results for the Cs atom.

Compared to hydrogenic one-electron systems, calcu-
lation of radiative corrections for many-electron atoms
brings in an additional layer of complexity: a strong
Coulomb repulsion between the electrons. The problem
is especially challenging for neutral many-electron atoms,
where the interaction of an outer-shell electron with other
electrons is comparable to its interaction with the nu-
cleus. At the same time, a reliable calculation of radia-
tive corrections for a heavy neutral system is required
in evaluation of the parity non-conserving (PNC) ampli-
tude in the 55-electron 133Cs atom. Here it has been
only recently realized that the sizes of radiative correc-
tions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] are comparable to the experimental
error bar [6] of 0.35% and, together with the Breit cor-
rection [7], dramatically aﬀect agreement (or disagree-
ment [8]) with the Standard Model of elementary parti-
cles.

A systematic approach to the problem of radiative cor-
rections in strongly correlated systems is to start from a
Furry representation based on a self-consistent electronic
potential [9]. This potential takes into account the fact
that an electron moves in an average ﬁeld created by
both the nucleus and other electrons. Based on this idea,
a program of calculating radiative corrections to PNC
amplitudes have been put forth by Sapirstein et al. [5].
Kuchiev and Flambaum [3] and Milstein et al. [4] pur-
sue a more qualitative approach using an independent-
electron approximation. We believe that the question
of an interplay between correlations and radiative cor-
rections is yet to be addressed. While here we do not
compute the PNC corrections, we illuminate a situation
where disregarding correlations would lead to a substan-
tial error in determining radiative correction: a radiative
correction changes sign and even the order of magnitude

when the presence of other electrons is accounted for.

In particular, we consider vacuum polarization (VP)
corrections to energies of atomic states. To the leading
order in αZ the VP may be accounted for by introducing
the Uehling potential UVP(r) into the atomic Hamilto-
nian. This potential is attractive, and for a hydrogen-
like ion the resulting VP corrections to the energies are
always negative. For a complex atom, we ﬁnd by con-
trast that, for orbitals with l > 0, the total correction
is positive. Brieﬂy, the reason for such a counterintu-
itive eﬀect is due to a readjustment of atomic orbitals
when the UVP(r) potential is added to the self-consistent
Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) equations. The innermost 1s
orbitals are “pulled in” by the short-ranged VP poten-
tial, leading to a decrease of the eﬀective nuclear charge
seen by the outer orbitals and thus to an increase of the
electrostatic energy of these orbitals. Since for orbitals
with l > 0, overlap with UVP(r) and thus the lowest
order correction are small, the resulting indirect “relax-
ation” contribution dominates the total VP correction to
the energies. In the following we will present numerical
results supporting this relaxation mechanism. Atomic
units (~ = |e| = me ≡ 1) are used throughout.

Because of our interest in PNC in Cs, below we illus-
trate the relaxation eﬀect with numerical results for this
atom; however, the relaxation mechanism is also appli-
cable in the cases of other many-electron atoms. We also
notice that the relaxation mechanism described here is
similar to that observed in calculations of the Breit cor-
rections [10, 11].

where the single-particle Dirac Hamiltonian is

where ρ0 is the normalization constant, c and a are the
nuclear parameters.
In our the numerical example for
133Cs, we use c = 5.6748 fm and a = 0.52 fm.

A common starting point for describing a multi-
electron atom is the self-consistent ﬁeld method. Here
the many-body wave-function is approximated by a
Slater determinant constructed from single-particle or-
bitals (bi-spinors) uk(r). The orbitals are obtained by
solving self-consistently the eigenvalue equations

(h0 + UDHF) uk(r) = εkuk(r) ,

(4)

where UDHF is the traditional DHF potential which de-
pends on the orbitals occupied in the Slater determinant.
The DHF energies for the core and several valence or-
bitals of Cs are listed in Table I.

The polarization of the vacuum by the nucleus mod-
iﬁes the nuclear electric ﬁeld seen by the electrons. To

We approximated ρnuc(r) with the Fermi distribution,
Eq. (3).
In the numerical evaluation of the extended-
nucleus Uehling potential, we employed the routine from
Ref. [12]. The Uehling potential UVP (r) generated by
the Cs nucleus is shown in Fig. 1. Notice that the actual
range of this potential is a few nuclear radii (instead of
Compton wavelength λe ≈ 384 fm), because the potential
for a point-like charge, Eq.(5), diverges logarithmically as
r → 0; therefore the folded potential UVP is dominated
by the contributions accumulated inside the nucleus.

the eﬀective range of the VP potential.

How does one compute the VP corrections δεk to the
energies of the atomic orbitals? Below we consider two
possibilities: (i) lowest-order perturbative treatment,

δε(1)

k = huk|UVP|uki ,

(6)

and (ii) the self-consistent approach.
Indeed, as in
Ref. [2], the VP potential may be introduced into the
DHF equations,

(h0 + UVP + U ′

k(r) = ε′

k(r) ,

k and orbitals u′

and a set of new energies ε′
k(r) is ob-
tained. Notice that the DHF potential is modiﬁed as
well, since it depends on the new set of the occupied or-
bitals u′
k(r). The correlated VP correction to the energy
of the orbital k is simply

δεDHF
k

= ε′

k − εk .

(8)

Additionally, we carried out an independent corre-
lated calculation in the framework of the linearized Cou-
pled DHF approximation [13], which is equivalent to the
random-phase approximation (RPA). This approxima-
tion describes a linear response of the atomic orbitals
to the perturbing interaction, i.e. the VP potential. Nu-
merical values obtained from the linearized coupled DHF
calculations were in close agreement with the full DHF
results.

The numerical results of our calculations are presented
in Table I. While analyzing this Table, we observe that
the lowest order corrections, δε(1)
k , are always negative,
reﬂecting the fact that the Uehling potential is attractive
(see Fig. 1). Owing to the short-ranged nature of VP,
and the fact that only the s-orbitals have a signiﬁcant
overlap with the nucleus, the corrections to the energies
of l = 0 orbitals are much larger than those for l >
0 orbitals. As to the correlated corrections, they diﬀer
quite substantially from the lowest order-corrections. A
comparison of Eq. (7) and Eq. (4) reveals the origin of
this discrepancy: the perturbation, in addition to the
Uehling potential, contains a diﬀerence between the two
DHF potentials

δU = UVP + (U ′

DHF − UDHF) .

(9)

For orbitals with l > 0, where the ﬁrst term above is
small, the modiﬁcation of the DHF potential contributes
signiﬁcantly to the VP energy corrections.

The modiﬁcation of the DHF potential induced by the
vacuum polarization is clearly a many-body eﬀect, not
present in hydrogen-like system. Such an eﬀect has been
explored before, for example in calculations of the Breit
corrections [10, 11], and it is commonly referred to as a
relaxation mechanism. Let us illustrate this relaxation
mechanism. Denoting the correction to the occupied or-
bital wave functions as χa(r) = u′
a(r) − ua(r), we write

DHF − UDHF) (r) ≈

where we discarded contributions non-linear in χa(r),
and “exchange” denotes non-local part of the perturba-
tion. The ﬁrst two (direct) terms can be interpreted as an
electrostatic potential produced by a perturbation δρel(r)
in the radial electronic density

We plot both the electronic density ρel(r) and the VP-
induced perturbation δρel(r) in Fig. 2. The minima of
ρel(r) correspond to positions of the electronic shells,
marked on the plot by their values of principal quantum
number n.

The ﬁgure 2 may be interpreted in the following way:
the s orbitals are “pulled in” by the attractive Uehling
potential closer to the nucleus. As a result, screening of
the nuclear charge by the inner orbitals becomes more
eﬃcient. For example, the modiﬁcation of the eﬀective
charge felt by the n = 2 electrons is simply the area un-
der the δρel(r) curve, accumulated between r = 0 and
the radius of the shell (r ≈ 0.08a0); from Fig. 2 it is clear
that the induced modiﬁcation of the eﬀective charge for
the n = 2 shell has a negative sign. Such an enhanced
screening leads to a reduced attraction of the electrons by
the nucleus and to the increase in the energy of the outer
electrons. From Table I, we see that this indirect relax-
ation contribution to the energy may be well comparable
to the direct VP correction, δε(1)
k . While for l = 0 orbitals
the direct correction gives a reasonable estimate, for all
orbitals with l > 0, the neglect of the relaxation would
lead to even qualitatively incorrect result. Moreover, the
higher the orbital angular momentum, the smaller is the
direct correction, and the more important is the relax-
ation mechanism. For example, for 4d orbitals the VP
correction in the lowest order is four orders of magnitude
smaller than the correlated result.

To summarize, here we illuminated the importance
of the self-consistent many-body treatment in calcu-
lations of vacuum polarization corrections.
Including
the VP Uehling potential into the atomic Hamiltonian
causes re-adjustment (relaxation) of the electrostatic self-
consistent ﬁeld. The induced change in the electrostatic
energies is substantial for states with the orbital angular
momentum l > 0. As illustrated in our numerical results

for Cs, the relaxation mechanism determines the sign and
even the order of magnitude of the total VP correction
for orbitals with l > 0.

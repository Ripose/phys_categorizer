We present experimental and theoretical studies of the absorption, emission and photodissociation
spectra of Rb2 molecules in solid helium. We have identiﬁed 11 absorption bands of Rb2. All laser-
excited molecular states are quenched by the interaction with the He matrix. The quenching results
in eﬃcient population of a metastable (1)3Πu state, which emits ﬂuorescence at 1042 nm. In order
to explain the ﬂuorescence at the forbidden transition and its time dependence we propose a new
molecular exciplex Rb2(3Πu)He2. We have also found evidence for the formation of diatomic bubble
states following photodissociation of Rb2.

INTRODUCTION

The spectroscopy of alkali dimers,

in particular of
the Rb2 molecule is a well established area of research
[1, 2, 3, 4]. Recently it has attracted renewed attention
in connection with the creation of ultracold molecules
via the photoassociation of ultracold atoms in magneto-
In such experiments the ultracold
optical traps [5, 6].
molecules are usually produced in their lowest triplet
state (a3Σ), and their transfer into the zero-vibration sin-
glet ground state X 1Σ remains a major problem [7, 8, 9].
Another recently developed technique [10, 11, 12, 13] in-
volves the attachment of several alkali atoms to a super-
ﬂuid helium nano-droplet, where they cool down to 0.38
K and may form a dimer. The energy released in the for-
mation of a strongly bound molecule in its singlet ground
state usually results in the complete evaporation of the
nano-droplet, therefore only weakly bound triplet states
could be observed in most of these studies. There have
been a few reports on alkali dimers in cryogenic rare-gas
matrices. Takahashi et. al.
[14] observed emission of
Na2 molecules in superﬂuid helium, and some absorption
bands of Li2 and Na2 in solid xenon were reported in [15].
Theoretical studies were reported for Na2 in solid argon
[16, 17].

In our earlier publications, the spectroscopy of Cs
and Rb atoms in solid helium has been well established
[18, 19, 20, 21]. The absorption of laser radiation at the
wavelengths of the Cs D1 and D2 transitions, blueshifted
by the interaction with the He matrix, induces ﬂuores-
cence on the atomic D1 line and emission bands from
bound-free transitions in Cs∗He2 and Cs∗He7 exciplexes.
Fluorescence from Rb atoms in solid helium is quenched
by the interaction with the matrix [22]. The quenching
is attributed to the very fast formation of Rb∗HeN ex-
ciplexes. A weak absorption on the Rb D1 transition at
760 nm has been detected in a transmission experiment

nm) from the top is used for the implantation, and a non-
focused horizontal laser beam is used for the excitation of
the implanted atoms/molecules. The video camera is used to
monitor crystal growth and the implantation process.

[20]. Only recently [21] a weak ﬂuorescence from the Rb
D1 and D2 transitions was obtained in solid He, together
with the emission of Rb∗HeN exciplexes. No ﬂuorescence
from nor absorption by Rb2 molecules in bulk solid or liq-
uid He has been reported so far. Here we present the ﬁrst
experimental study of Rb2 dimers in solid helium.

II. EXPERIMENT

A. Experimental setup

The experimental setup is illustrated in Fig. 1. A
solid 4He matrix doped with Rb atoms was produced
by the technique described in our earlier papers [19, 23].
The measurements were performed in the hcp and bcc
crystalline phases of solid 4He in the pressure range of
27 − 36 bar, at a temperature of 1.5 K . The sample was
produced in a helium pressure cell immersed in superﬂuid
helium cooled by pumping on the helium bath. Windows

provide optical access from three orthogonal directions.
A helium crystal is grown inside the pressure cell, by
condensing and then solidifying pressurized helium gas
from an external reservoir. The helium host matrix is
then doped with rubidium atoms, as shown in Fig. 1,
by means of laser ablation with the second harmonic of
a pulsed frequency-doubled Nd:YAG-laser beam (or the
signal beam of the OPO described below) focused onto a
solid target containing pure natural Rb or a Rb-Cs mix-
ture.

We have studied the absorption spectrum of the sam-
ple in the range of 400-1000 nm. In order to cover such
a broad range, three sources of coherent radiation were
used: (i) the signal beam from an optical parametric os-
cillator (OPO, OPTA GmbH model BBO-355-vis/IR),
pumped by the third harmonic (354 nm) of a pulsed
Nd:YAG laser for 400-700 nm; (ii) the idler beam of the
same OPO for 780-1000 nm, and (iii) a tunable cw Ti:Sa
laser pumped by a Nd:YVO3 laser for 720-780 nm. The
excitation laser beams (ii) and (iii) cross the pressure cell
in a horizontal direction, passing through the volume of
maximal doping. The beam (i) illuminates the sample
from the top of the cryostat. In this conﬁguration the
signal beam of the OPO (pulse energy of 2 mJ, pulse
width of 5 ns, wavelength in the range of 500-670 nm)
can also be used as implantation laser.

Fluorescence light from the sample volume (approx.
3 mm3) is collected by a lens located in the cryostat and
then analyzed by a grating spectrograph (Oriel, model
MS257) with a resolution of 2 nm equipped with a CCD
camera.
In addition to spectral measurements we also
performed time-resolved studies of the molecular ﬂuo-
rescence, for which we used a Si photodiode mounted
after a second output slit of the spectrograph. The time-
resolution of this system is limited by the 100 kHz band-
width of the preampliﬁer.

B. Observed emission spectra

The ﬂuorescence spectrum observed in experiments
with a crystal doped from a solid Rb target contains fea-
tures which can be associated with atomic Rb, with Rb2
dimers and with Rb∗HeN exciplexes (Fig. 2). Recently
we have done a detailed spectroscopic study of the Rb-He
exciplexes [21]. We restrict the present discussion to Rb
and Rb2. A typical emission spectrum obtained under
excitation at 570 nm is shown in Fig. 2, in which one
distinguishes three spectral features. The two compo-
nents of the narrow doublet at 780 nm are easily identi-
ﬁed as the D1 and D2 emission lines of atomic Rb. They
are separated by 14 nm, which corresponds to the ﬁne-
structure splitting of the Rb 5PJ states in solid helium.
Both components of the doublet are strongly broadened
and blueshifted with respect to the free Rb atom due to
the interaction with the surrounding He. Both the shift
and the spectral width depend on the He pressure. The
intensity of these two lines is orders of magnitude lower

than the intensity of the D1 line of Cs recorded under
similar conditions [19]. In a previous study [20] the D1
line of Rb was excited by a cw Ti:Sa laser in an absorption
experiment at 760 nm, but ﬂuorescence was overlooked
in that experiment, probably because of the strong inten-
sity of scattered laser radiation in this part of the spec-
trum. We attribute the central spectral feature of Fig. 2
to Rb*He2 exciplexes, formed by the atomic 5P states as
discussed in detail elsewhere [21]. The rightmost spec-
tral feature at 1042 nm originates from the Rb2 dimer.
It is the only molecular band that could be observed in
the ﬂuorescence spectrum in the range of 500-1600 nm,
when exciting the sample in the range of 450-900 nm.

C. Excitation spectra

The molecular emission at 1042 nm can be excited on
a number of resonant absorption bands. The excitation
spectrum of the 1042 nm emission is shown in Fig. 3(a).
The rightmost band centered at 842 nm (feature ”a”) is
the strongest band observed in the present experiments.
The band at 740 nm (labelled ”b”) overlaps with the D2
absorption line of atomic Rb. As a rule, the signal is
much larger when the beam is focused and illuminates
the sample in the vertical direction. However, some of
the other bands with maxima at 650, 580, 525, and 445
nm could even be observed with a non-focused beam.
In addition, the blue wing of the band at 650 nm has
a shoulder (labelled ”d”), which can be interpreted as a
weaker band partially overlapping with the 650 nm band.
At higher helium pressures this band shifts towards the
blue at a faster rate than the stronger band. At 35 bar
its maximum is at 625 nm and the two bands become
resolved.

The fact that the emission peak at 1042 nm appears
under excitation at very diﬀerent wavelengths and that
no other molecular emission is observed suggests that
all molecular excited states are quenched by the interac-

tion with the helium matrix. The excitation of any state
seems to be followed by very fast radiationless or far in-
frared transitions to a low-lying state which decays by
emitting 1042 nm light.

Fig. 3(c) shows the excitation spectrum for atomic
emission on the Rb D1/D2 doublet (actually the detec-
tion spectrograph was set to 780 nm, which corresponds
to D1 emission). The features ”j”, ”e”, ”d”, and ”i”
show that atomic emission can not only be excited by
absorption at the atomic resonance lines (740 and 760
nm respectively), but also at 650, 580, and 495 nm. We
assign these bands to absorption by molecular state(s)
of Rb2 which dissociate into one ground-state and one
excited state atom.

D. Time resolved ﬂuorescence

We measured the time dependence of the molecular
ﬂuorescence following pulsed excitation at selected exci-
tation and emission wavelengths. A characteristic ﬂuo-
rescence pulse shape is shown in Fig. 4. The atomic and
exciplex emission decay-times are too short to be resolved
by our detection system. Both channels yield a ﬂuores-
cence pulse which coincides with that of the scattered
laser light (curve 1 in Fig. 4) and thus reﬂects the time
resolution (FWHM = 3 µs) of the detector. This is con-
sistent with other studies of atomic Rb and Cs in liquid
He [22], and our own (unpublished) results on Cs in solid
He in which atomic lifetimes on the order of a few 10 ns
were observed. The molecular ﬂuorescence at 1042 nm
shows an exponential decay with a characteristic time of
45 µs that is well resolved (curve 2 in Fig. 4). The ﬂuo-
rescence pulse shows also an intriguing ﬁnite rise-time of
approximately 15 µs. Pulse shapes with identical decay
and rise-times could be measured when exciting either at
840 or at 650 nm.

ﬂuorescence at 1042 nm, (c) measured photodissociation spec-
trum of the Rb dimer (detected via the atomic Rb ﬂuores-
cence at 780 nm). (b), (d) are calculated Condon factors for
the transitions from the X 1Σg and (1)3Σu states populating
the (1)3Πu state (b) and the atomic 5P1/2 state (d). Experi-
mental data are shown as points, and the solid lines are ﬁtted
Gaussians. The assignment of all peaks is given in Table III C
and in the text of Sec. III. The dotted vertical lines mark the
spectral regions covered by the 3 excitation sources described
in the text. The vertical scales diﬀer for the diﬀerent intervals.

process. The blueshift and the intensity of the ﬂuores-
cence following absorption on the photodissociating band
at 650 nm decrease with decreasing He pressure, similar
to the behavior observed on the atomic ﬂuorescence of
Cs (excited on the atomic D1 line) in solid He [19]. How-
ever, unlike the observation of the purely atomic process
in cesium-doped helium, the intensity rises again when
the (photodissociation-induced) ﬂuorescence is recorded
during the phase transition to the liquid. The ﬂuores-
cence recorded under the latter conditions is shown as
curve 2 in Fig. 5(b). One sees that the spectral width of
each component of the atomic ﬂuorescence doublet (curve
2) coming from that structure is smaller and that their
intensity ratio diﬀers from the one observed in hcp helium
(curve1). The blueshift of both spectral lines under those
conditions is only 4.0 nm, much smaller than in solid He,
but also signiﬁcantly smaller than in pressurized (25 bar)
superﬂuid He [25], when excited at the atomic D1 line
(760 nm). We could not observe any ﬂuorescence after
the complete melting of the crystal.

The molecular ﬂuorescence band at 1040 nm (excited
at 650 nm) exhibits a qualitatively diﬀerent behavior at
the same phase transition. The spectral position and the
width of the band do not show a measurable pressure de-
pendence and the intensity quickly vanishes at the tran-
sition from the bcc phase to the liquid. We could not
detect any molecular emission induced by excitation at
650 nm, under the same conditions in which curve 2 of
Fig. 5(b) was obtained.

We have performed the same measurements when the
sample is irradiated with 580 nm light. Here the behavior
is again quite diﬀerent. The atomic ﬂuorescence disap-
pears already at the beginning of the bcc to liquid phase
transition, while, at the same time, the molecular ﬂuores-
cence can be observed until the complete melting. This
interesting phenomenon will be discussed below.

III. THEORETICAL MODEL

The dimer Rb2 is the best candidate for describing
most of the observed spectral lines described above, and
we will substantiate this assignment by discussing its ab-
sorption and ﬂuorescence spectra in detail.

A. Molecular potentials

Theoretical ab initio potential curves of the Rb2
molecule are available in the literature [26, 27]. The po-
tentials from [26] are shown in Fig. 6. The ground state
of Rb2 has two components: a deeply bound (covalent)
singlet state X 1Σg and a weakly bound (van der Waals)
triplet state (1)3Σu.

The wavefunctions of the molecule’s oscillations de-
pend on a single parameter r, the internuclear separation
in the diatomic molecule, and can be found by solving the

photodissociation of Rb2 following excitation at 650 nm (b):
curve 1 - hcp phase at p = 30 bar, curve 2 - during the solid-
liquid phase transition at p = 26.4 bar. Vertical dashed lines
mark the wavelengths of the free atomic D1 and D2 lines at
795 and 780 nm.

E. Emission spectra at the phase transition

We have performed experiments at diﬀerent helium
pressures in the range of 26-36 bar. At 1.5 K, two phase
transitions occur within this range [24]. The solidiﬁca-
tion of superﬂuid He at 26.4 bar produces ﬁrst a body-
centered cubic (bcc) crystalline structure, and then a
hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure at 26.8 bar. The
standard implantation procedure described above pro-
duces the best results, i.e., the largest density of im-
planted species and hence of spectroscopic signals when
applied at 29.5 bar in the hcp crystal. By releasing the
pressure after the doping process to below 27 bar we were
able to observe molecular and atomic ﬂuorescence in the
bcc phase and even during the transition to the liquid
phase.

When atomic Rb in a hcp crystal at 30 bar is excited at
740 nm the D1/D2 ﬂuorescence spectrum (Fig. 5(a)) is
blue-shifted by approximately 10 nm and strongly broad-
ened with respect to the free atomic lines. When the
same ﬂuorescing transitions are observed after photodis-
sociation of Rb2 at 650 nm under otherwise identical con-
ditions the emission lines shown as curve 1 in Fig. 5(b)
are observed. The spectrum shows a reduced blue shift of
approximately 7 nm. These ﬂuorescence spectra exhibit
interesting features, when recorded during the melting

When calculating the Franck-Condon factors one has
to take into account the selection rules, which allow only
transitions between terms of the same multiplicity, while
transitions between singlet and triplet states are forbid-
den.
In most spectroscopic experiments [3], the alkali
dimers are produced in a hot and dense atomic vapor in
which only the deeply bound X 1Σg state is populated.
Therefore only the transitions between singlet states have
been studied in detail and the corresponding potential
curves evaluated. As for the triplet states, the available
potential curves are obtained mainly from ab initio cal-
culations.

B. Emission spectrum

The long decay-time of the molecular ﬂuorescence sug-
gests that it originates from a metastable state and
that the corresponding transition is forbidden in the free
molecule. Inspection of the potential energy diagram in
Fig. 6 reveals the (1)3Πu state to be a good candidate
for the excited state of the ﬂuorescing transition. It is
the lowest lying excited state of the molecule, and it
can be populated by a cascade of radiationless transi-
tions following laser excitation to any other higher ly-
ing state.
In the free molecule the transition to the
singlet ground-state X 1Σg is forbidden by multiplicity
and the triplet-triplet transition to the (1)3Σu state by
parity. The absence of ﬂuorescence from other excited
states suggests that in solid He these states are quickly
quenched and that all excited population is collected in
the long-lived (1)3Πu state, which ﬁnally decays towards
the X 1Σg ground-state. A similar eﬀect was reported
in spectroscopic studies of Hg2 dimers in a cryogenic Ar
matrix [28], where only the emission from the metastable
A0+
g state was observed under excitation on four diﬀerent
allowed transitions.

The potentials in Fig. 6 show that the minimum of the
(1)3Πu potential lies almost at the same internuclear dis-
tance as the minimum of the ground state. The overlap
integral between the lowest vibrational states v′ = v = 0
is therefore exceptionally large and quickly vanishes with
increasing v′. In fact only 0→0 and 0→1 transitions pro-

The transition probabilities between vibrational states
of a given electronic transition are given by the Franck-
Condon factors, i.e., the overlap integrals between the
wavefunctions of excited (Ψe) and ground (Ψg) states.
There is an important simpliﬁcation resulting from the
fact that at the temperature of our experiments (1.5 K)
only the lowest molecular vibration states are populated.
Therefore the absorption spectrum consists only of tran-
sitions from the v = 0 vibration level in the electronic

FIG. 7: Experimental (points) and calculated (solid curves)
emission spectra of (1)3Πu → X 1Σg transition in Rb2. Curve
1 was obtained by shifting the calculated curve by 20 nm to
the red. Curve 2 is obtained by shifting the excited state po-
tential curve by 0.12 ˚A towards larger interatomic distances,
and then shifting again the calculated spectrum by 20 nm to
the red.

order to model the observed emission band, we represent
these two components by Gaussian curves with a spec-
tral width (FWHM) of 7.5 nm. This width was chosen
to match the left side of the experimental spectrum as
shown in Fig. 7 and is typical for atomic emission lines
in solid helium. The amplitudes of the curves are given
by the calculated Franck-Condon factors.

The calculated emission band has its peak at 1022 nm,
whereas the experimental band peaks at 1042 nm. This
shift of 20 nm can be attributed either to the interaction
of the molecule with the helium matrix, or to the impreci-
sion of the theoretical molecular potentials. Atomic emis-
sion lines in solid and liquid He are known to be shifted
by 10-15 nm towards shorter wavelengths, and to show
an increase of this shift with the increase of He pressure.
However, our observations of the molecular ﬂuorescence
band discussed here show that its spectral position and
its lineshape do not depend on pressure, which leads us to
conclude that the observed wavelength is close to the one
of the free molecule. As the ground-state potential curve
is very well known from theory and experiments [3, 29],
one therefore has to suspect imprecisions of the (1)3Πu
potential curve to be responsible for the 20 nm shift.
There are no detailed spectroscopic studies of this state.
Only the mutual perturbation of the A1Σu and (1)3Πu
states in the vicinity of their crossing point at 5.1 ˚A was
studied [30]. The observed ﬂuorescence spectrum (dots)
and the calculated band shifted by 20 nm (curve 1), are
compared in Fig. 7, after scaling the amplitude of the
calculated spectrum. The 20 nm shift suggests that the
depth of the calculated potential well is underestimated
by 190 cm−1.

The observed emission spectrum has a pronounced
asymmetry.
It may result from the overlap of several
(two) vibronic transitions, as discussed above. However,
when each component is modelled by a symmetric Gaus-

sorption bands (in nm). The second column shows the labels
of the corresponding peaks in Fig. 3.

sian curve, the resulting asymmetry is smaller than that
of the experimental spectrum (see Fig. 7). This discrep-
ancy can be reduced if one shifts the minimum of the
excited state potential with respect to that of the ground
state. Curve 2 in Fig. 7 was obtained by shifting this
potential curve by 0.12 ˚A towards larger interatomic
distances and yields a better agreement with the exper-
imental data. The alternative interpretation of the dis-
crepancy between the measured and calculated emission
spectra is presented below, in Sec. III D.

C. Molecular absorption spectrum

When comparing the calculated Franck-Condon fac-
tors of the absorption bands shown in Fig. 3(b) to the
experimentally measured spectra of Fig. 3(a) one can
identify all observed bands. The calculated wavelengths
of the band maxima are presented in the third column
of Table III C. The relative intensities can not be pre-
dicted by our model which does not consider the tran-
sition dipole moments. We have ﬁtted the experimental
spectra with Gaussian curves. The results of the ﬁts are
shown in Fig. 3(a) as solid lines and the positions of the
band maxima are collected in the fourth column of Ta-
ble III C.

The strongest absorption band at 842 nm (band ”a” in
Fig. 3(a)) belongs to the X 1Σg → A1Σu transition. The
experimentally measured absorption band is blueshifted
with respect to the calculated one by 35 nm. This shift
can again be attributed either to the inﬂuence of the He-
matrix, or to an uncertainty in the excited state potential
curve. The band at 740 nm (band ”b” in Fig. 3(a)) is
assigned to the (1)3Σu → (1)3Πg transition. Both the
excited and the ground state have very shallow poten-
tial wells and therefore the transition wavelength is very
close to that of the atomic D2 absorption line (the red
component of the doublet ”h” in Fig. 3(c)).

Another strong absorption band is observed at 653
nm (band ”c” in Fig. 3(a)). We identify it as the

X 1Σg → B1Πu band. The calculated band position is
at 664 nm. The potential curves of the involved states
are well known from experiments [29, 31]. The blueshift
due to the interaction with the He-matrix is 11 nm, sig-
niﬁcantly smaller than that of the atomic lines and of the
X 1Σg → A1Σu band.

The weak absorption band labelled ”d” in Fig. 3(a)
lies in a spectral region in which no allowed molecular
transitions exist. Its wavelength strongly depends on the
helium pressure. We suppose that this band (at 622 nm)
is due to the forbidden transition (1)3Σu → (3)1Σg from
the triplet ground-state.

The observed absorption band at 580 nm (peak ”e” in
Fig. 3) is a superposition of two allowed triplet-triplet
bands: (1)3Σu → (2)3Σg and (1)3Σu → (2)3Πg. None
of these states has been studied experimentally before.
The calculated wavelengths of both transitions are longer
than the experimental one by 6 and 10 nm respectively.
The absorption band at 525 nm (peak ”f” in Fig. 3(a))
can be attributed to another triplet-triplet system:
(1)3Σu → (3)3Σg. The calculated position of this band
is at 507 nm, i. e. the interaction with the matrix shifts
it to the red, unlike all other observed bands.

The narrow band at 445 nm (peak ”g” in Fig. 3(a))
can be assigned to allowed transitions from the singlet
ground state. The X 1Σg → (2)1Σu and X 1Σg → (2)1Πu
bands with calculated wavelengths of 477 and 465 nm
respectively are good candidates to explain this band.

D. Speculation about the formation of a molecular

Rb∗

2HeN exciplex

We have shown above that every observed excitation of
the Rb2 dimer ﬁnally leads to a population of the (1)3Πu
state. The laser-excited states do not ﬂuoresce at the ex-
citation wavelength, nor do they emit ﬂuorescence in the
near (red or blue) vicinity of the excitation wavelength
as atoms, e. g., typically do. The quenching of all up-
per states thus seems to occur on a time scale which is
much shorter than their radiative lifetimes. This deexci-
tation proceeds via a direct or a cascade-like radiationless
transition or via transitions emitting far-infrared light,
which is not accessible by our spectrometer. Only the
ﬁnal metastable state (1)3Πu, perturbed by the interac-
tion with the surrounding He, lives long enough to emit
ﬂuorescence with a lifetime of 45 µs.

Besides this long lifeteime we have observed an in-
triguingly long (15 µs) rise-time of the ﬂuorescence sig-
nal which indicates that the ﬂuorescing state is popu-
lated via some intermediate metastable level. This state
must lie below the A1Σu state, the lowest lying level after
whose excitation one observes the 1042 nm ﬂuorescence.
In Fig. 6 one sees that no such state exists in the free
Rb2 molecule.

For this reason we tentatively explain the observation
in terms of a relatively slow conformational change of the
system formed by the metastable Rb2(3Πu) molecule and

FIG. 8: Structure of the molecular Rb∗
2HeN exciplex in which
several He atoms from the interface of the molecular bubble
produce a bound or quasi-bound state with the rotationally
quenched metastable Rb2 ((1)3Πu) molecule. This structure
is proposed for explaining the puzzling time-dependence of
the molecular ﬂuorescence.

the surrounding helium atoms (molecular bubble). The
quantitative modelling of the interaction between the de-
fect molecule and the He crystal is beyond the scope of
the present paper. However, such a theoretical study was
reported recently [32] for the hydrogen molecule embed-
ded in liquid He. For the metastable c3Πu state which
is analogous to the (1)3Πu state of Rb2 the authors of
[32] suggest an exciplex structure consisting of several He
atoms bound around the waist of the dumbbell-shaped
molecular orbital of H2. This structure closely resembles
that of Cs(6P1/2)He7 and Rb(5P1/2)He6 exciplexes ob-
served in our recent experiments [19, 21] in solid He, it
is shown schematically in Fig. 8. Here we suggest that a
similar molecular exciplex Rb∗
2HeN could be formed by
the (1)3Πu state of the Rb2 molecule in solid He.

The metastable state of the dimer is prepared in a
relatively large molecular bubble. In order to leave the
bubble surface and to move towards the dimer, the He
atoms have to tunnel through a potential barrier. The
tunnelling time may be as long as a few microseconds,
which would explain the slow onset of the ﬂuorescence.
The perturbation of the dimer by the bound He atoms
lifts the selection rule that forbids the radiative transition
to the singlet ground-state. Unlike the atomic exciplexes
studied in [19, 21], the suggested molecular exciplex has
a very long life-time and its emission spectrum is very
similar to that of a free Rb2 molecule. The interaction
between the elliptical orbital of the X 1Σg ground state of
Rb2 and the attached He atoms is repulsive and shifts the
ground state towards higher energies. It is responsible for
the redshift of the measured emission spectrum whose
pressure-independence remains an open question. After
ﬂuorescing the exciplex dissociates and the He atoms re-

turn to the bubble interface. The 1042 nm ﬂuorescence
thus does not originate from the metastable (1)3Πu state
directly, but rather from an exciplex formed by that state.

E. Photodissociation spectrum

The excitation spectrum for atomic emission at 760
nm is presented in Fig. 3(c). Only the doublet labelled
”h” represents absorption by individual Rb atoms (D1
and D2 absorption lines). The peaks: ”d”, ”e”, ”i”, and
”j” represent photodissociation lines of the Rb2 molecule.
Three of them (”d”, ”e”, and ”i”) lie very close to the
molecular absorption bands discussed in the previous sec-
tion, while the peak ”j” has no analog in the absorption
spectrum of Fig. 3(a).

The calculated Franck-Condon factors for the relevant
molecular bands are shown in Fig. 3(d). The lineshapes
of the bound-free transition (1)3Σu → (2)3Σu (peak ”i”)
and of the bound-free part of the (1)3Σu → (1)3Πg band
(peak ”b”) are calculated based on a standard adiabatic
line-broadening theory [33] as the Fourier transform of
the autocorrelation function

C(τ ) = exp{−

(1 − exp[−i∆ν(r)τ ])Ψ(0)

g (r)2dr},

(4)

Z

where ∆ν(r) represents the transition energy correspond-
ing to the interatomic separation r. Only the bound-free
part of the (1)3Σu → (1)3Πg band is shown in Fig. 3(d),
whereas the bound-bound components of this band are
represented in Fig. 3(b) by their Franck-Condon factors.
The blue component of the atomic absorption dou-
blet ”h” (D2 resonance line) overlaps with the molecular
(1)3Σu → (1)3Πg absorption band (”b” in Fig. 3(a)).
As can be seen from Fig. 6, the position of the mini-
mum (6.1 ˚A) of the shallow potential well of the triplet
ground-state is much larger than that of the (1)3Πg state.
The Condon point of the excited state is right at the
top of the potential barrier. Excitations occurring at
smaller distances thus populate vibrational states which
rapidly relax towards the bottom of the potential well
with subsequent radiationless transitions to lower-lying
electronic states, and ﬁnally to the (1)3Πu state. On
the other hand, absorption at larger internuclear dis-
tances populates the right side of the (1)3Πg potential
barrier which results in the dissociation of the molecule
into a 5S ground-state atom and an atom in the excited
5P state. This dissociation channel cannot be distin-
guished from the purely atomic absorption-emission cy-
cle in our experiments. A similar competition between
quenching and dissociation of the (1)3Πg state was ob-
served in experiments on potassium dimers attached to
helium nanodroplets [10, 13], where the atomic absorp-
tion lines and the molecular (1)3Σu → (1)3Πg band were
resolved.
In those experiments the quenching of the
laser-excited (1)3Πg state of K2 resulted in ﬂuorescence

8

at the two allowed singlet-singlet transitions, whose up-
per states lie below the (1)3Πg state: A1Σu → X 1Σg
and B1Πu → X 1Σg. The fast desorption of the excited
molecule from the surface of the droplet prevented the
population of the metastable (1)3Πg state to be observed
in that study.

The photodissociation band ”i” has almost the same
wavelength as the X 1Σg → B1Πu band in Fig. 3(a) (la-
belled ”c”). However, the Condon point of the B1Πu
potential lies well below the dissociation limit, and hence
no photodissociation is expected. We therefore attribute
the peak ”i” to a dissociation of the dimer following ab-
sorption from the triplet ground-state. The only band
that has a corresponding wavelength is the forbidden
(1)3Σu → (2)3Σu transition at 670 nm. The excited state
is strongly repulsive and the shift due to the interaction
with the matrix has the same sign as for all other bands
and a magnitude of 20 nm. The photodissociation at the
wavelength close to the X 1Σg → B1Πu band of Rb2 was
observed in an experiment with He-nanodroplets [12].
The authors of [12] interpret it as either the forbidden
(1)3Σu → (2)3Σu transition that becomes allowed due to
the perturbation of the Rb2 molecule by the matrix, or
as the dissociation of a Rb3 molecule.

The photodissociation peak at 625 nm overlaps with
the peak ”d” of Fig. 3(a), and therefore we assign it to the
same forbidden (1)3Σu → (3)1Σg transition. The poten-
tial curve of the (3)1Σg state below the Condon point is
crossed by the repulsive (2)3Σu state and by the strongly
bound (2)3Σg state. The transition to the former results
in the dissociation of the dimer, while the latter is con-
nected by an allowed transition to the metastable (1)3Πu
state which ﬂuoresces at 1042 nm.

Using the same arguments we can assign the asym-
metric photodissociation band at 590 nm (peak ”e” of
Fig. 3(c)) to a superposition of the (1)3Σu → (2)3Σg and
(1)3Σu → (2)3Πg transitions. The photodissociation is
due to the crossing of the (2)3Σg state with the repulsive
(2)3Σu state at R=5.5 ˚A, below the Condon point.

Finally, the band peaked at 493 nm (peak ”j” in
Fig. 3(c)) produces no molecular ﬂuorescence but only
photodissociation. It can be assigned to one of the three
forbidden transitions from the singlet ground-state, viz.,
X 1Σg → (3)1Σg (505 nm), X 1Σg → (2)3Πu (496 nm), or
X 1Σg → (2)3Σu (488 nm). The upper state of the last
transition is repulsive, while the upper states of the ﬁrst
two transitions cross it below their Condon points and
may thus also populate it.

F. Photodissociation vs molecular emission at the
phase transition

Here we suggest a speculative qualitative interpreta-
tion of the changes in the ﬂuorescence spectrum at the
solid-liquid phase transition. The ﬂuorescence at 1042
nm following the excitation at 650 nm disappears dur-
ing the transition to the liquid phase because the up-

9

repulsion, this overlap results in a shift of the atomic lev-
els towards higher energies. Because of the larger shift of
the excited state the transition becomes blue shifted.

Based on the bubble model we suggest the following
qualitative interpretation of the observed lineshifts at
the phase transition. The Rb2 dimer forms a molec-
ular bubble whose shape reﬂects the symmetry of the
molecule’s electronic conﬁguration. The photodissocia-
tion of Rb2 does not result in the formation of two inde-
pendent atoms occupying each an individual bubble, but
the two Rb atoms, separated by several ˚A, will rather
reside in a single large helium bubble (Fig. 9). It is not
clear a priori whether this diatomic bubble conﬁguration
is energetically favored over the situation, in which atoms
reside in individual bubbles. Because of the larger aver-
age distance of the ﬁrst He solvation shell this molecular
bubble will perturb the atomic levels to a lesser extent
than the smaller monoatomic bubble (studied in [18, 25])
and could therefore explain the smaller spectral shifts of
the observed emission lines.

IV. SUMMARY

We have presented results of laser-induced ﬂuorescence
experiments in solid He doped by laser ablation from a
metallic rubidium target. We have observed for the ﬁrst
time ﬂuorescence from Rb atoms and from Rb2 dimers
in solid He. Atomic emission was observed after atomic
excitation as well as after excitation of photodissociating
states in the Rb2 molecule. In the latter case the atomic
emission lines are less perturbed than after direct atomic
excitation, a fact which we attribute to emission from
diatomic bubbles.

Absorption and emission bands of Rb2 were studied in
the visible and near infrared domains. All absorption and
photodissociation bands in this range could be assigned
by comparison with calculated Franck-Condon factors.
No emission from any of the allowed transitions of the
free Rb2 molecule could be observed in the investigated
spectral range. At the same time we found a large num-
ber of absorption bands which all lead to emission of ﬂuo-
rescence on the forbidden transition from the metastable
(1)3Πu state to the ground state. The emitting state was
found to have a lifetime of 45 µs and a formation time
of 15 µs. We interpret this feature by proposing that
the metastable state forms (on a time scale of 15 µs)
a Rb2(3Πu)HeN molecular exciplex, which then decays
with a lifetime of 45 µs.

FIG. 9: Possible ﬁnal bubble conﬁgurations following disso-
ciation of the Rb2 dimer by absorption of 650 nm light. The
situation shown on top is energetically favored. Experimen-
tal evidence that the upper graph describes the dissociation
process comes from the fact that the atomic ﬂuorescence line
emitted after photodissociation is less shifted than the well
studied emission from the atomic bubble (bottom graph).

per B1Πu state becomes less perturbed by the surround-
ing helium and the rate of radiationless transition to
the metastable (1)3Πu state drops below that of the al-
lowed radiative transition B1Πu → X 1Σg. This emis-
sion is diﬃcult to detect experimentally because of a very
strong background from scattered laser light at 650 nm.
Nonetheless the red wing of this band appears in the
experimental spectra close to the atomic doublet. On
the other hand, the photodissociation at 650 nm is much
less sensitive to changes in the helium density because
the dissociating state is populated directly by absorption
and involves no radiationless transition.

The absorption at 580 nm populates the states (2)3Σg
and (2)3Πg which themselves do not dissociate but which
have allowed radiative transitions to the metastable
(1)3Πu state and thus do ﬂuoresce at 1042 nm. In conse-
quence, a reduction of the helium density results in a sup-
pression of the photodissociation due to matrix induced
mixing with dissociative states, while the metastable
state is still eﬃciently populated and thus emits ﬂuo-
rescence.

The systematic diﬀerence of the spectral shifts of the
atomic emission lines following excitation via diﬀerent
channels (atomic absorption at 760 nm or photodissocia-
tion at 650 nm) suggests that the presence of the second
(ground-state) Rb atom (resulting from the dissociation)
reduces the perturbation imposed by the surrounding He
on the ﬂuorescence emitting Rb atom. The bubble model
[18, 25] successfully predicts the shifts of the resonance
lines of Rb and Cs bubbles in liquid and solid He. As
the electronic density of the excited P state in the alkali
occupies a larger volume than its ground state, it has a
larger overlap with the surrounding He. Due to the Pauli

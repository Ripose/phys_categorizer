We develop the method of ﬁnding analytical solutions of the Bogolyubov-De Gennes equations for the excitations of
a Bose condensate in the Thomas-Fermi regime in harmonic traps of any asymmetry and introduce a classiﬁcation
of eigenstates. In the case of cylindrical symmetry we emphasize the presence of an accidental degeneracy in the
excitation spectrum at certain values of the projection of orbital angular momentum on the symmetry axis and
discuss possible consequences of the degeneracy in the context of new signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation.

The recent realization of Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) in trapped alkali atom gases [1–3], followed by
the second generation of experiments [4–8], has opened
the possibility of investigating macroscopic quantum phe-
nomena in these systems. For understanding the macro-
scopic quantum behavior of a trapped Bose-condensed
gas especially important is the character of elemen-
tary excitations of the trapped condensate, which to a
large extent is predetermined by the interaction between
atoms.
In dilute gases the interaction is primarily bi-
nary and is characterized by a single parameter, a, the
s-wave scattering length. This allows one to develop a
transparent theory which can be tested experimentally.
At present theoretical investigations of elementary ex-
citations of trapped Bose condensates include analyti-
cal solutions for the spectrum of low-energy excitations
in spherically symmetric harmonic traps in the Thomas-
Fermi regime [9] and numerical analysis of the eigenfunc-
tions and eigenenergies of the excitations in the traps of
spherical and cylindrical symmetry [10–14]. In the lat-
ter case the eigenfrequencies of the lowest excitations, as
those measured in the JILA [4,8] and MIT [7] experi-
ments, have also been found analytically [9,15,16,13].

Most interesting are the low-energy excitations, i.e.,
the excitations with energies much smaller than the
chemical potential (mean ﬁeld interaction between parti-
cles), as they are essentially of collective character. Pre-
vious studies revealed that the eigenfrequencies of con-
densate oscillations are strongly diﬀerent from those of a
collisionless thermal gas [4,7,8], but are rather close to the
frequencies of a thermal gas in the hydrodynamic regime
[16,17]. In this paper we develop the method of ﬁnding
analytical solutions of the Bogolyubov-De Gennes equa-
tions for the spectrum and wavefunctions of the conden-
sate excitations in the Thomas-Fermi regime in harmonic
traps of any type of asymmetry and introduce a classi-
ﬁcation of eigenstates. We analyse the structure of the
excitation spectrum in the case of cylindrical symmetry
and ﬁnd an accidental degeneracy at certain values of the
projection of orbital angular momentum on the symme-
try axis. We address the question of how the accidental

degeneracy can manifest itself, providing us with a clear
distinction between the condensate oscillations and the
oscillations of a classical gas in the hydrodynamic regime.
We consider a Bose-condensed gas in an external har-
monic potential V (r) = M

The solution (16) can be used in Eqs. (10) and (11)
from the very beginning for ﬁnding the wavefunctions
and spectrum of elementary excitations with energies
¯hωi. However, for the excitations with energies
Eν ≫
comparable to the trap frequencies this would lead to
an incorrect result. Moreover, such a procedure makes
Eqs. (10) and (11) incompatible with each other. The
physical reason is that the wavefunctions of such exci-
tations vary over a distance comparable with the size of
the condensate. Hence, the kinetic energy of the conden-
sate, omitted in the derivation of Eq.(16), and the kinetic
energy of the excitations are equally important. This
is taken into account in our derivation of Eqs. (13) and
(14), relying on the exact expression for Ψ0. In principle,
the exact equations (13) and (14) can be used to obtain
a systematic expansion of the excitation wavefunctions
and energies in the ζ parameter.

In the case of spherical symmetry (ωi = ω = ω) the
excitations are characterized by the orbital angular mo-
mentum l and its projection m. The solution of Eq.(17)
has the form W = xl/2P (x)Ylm(θ, φ), where Ylm is a

For cylindrically symmetric traps (ω1 = ω2 = ωρ,
ω3 = ωz) the projection of the orbital angular momentum
on the z axis, m, is a conserved quantity. The eigen-
states of the excitations can be labeled by the quan-
tum numbers N , m, and the axial parity
Pz. The
radial parity describing the behavior of the eigenfunc-
tions with respect to simultaneous inversion of the two
radial coordinates is [+] for even m, and [

m. The polynomials W can be represented in the form
W = ρ|m|Bnm(ρ, z) exp (imφ), where ρ and z are the di-
mensionless axial and radial coordinates, and Bnm poly-
nomials of power n = N

mial Bnm has the form znz ρnρ, where nz and nρ are pos-
itive integers. The sum nz + nρ takes the values 0, 2, ...n

In the simplest case of m = 0 Eq.(26) gives the fre-
quencies of the quadrupole shape oscillations of the con-
densate. The frequencies Ω±
20 and the frequency of
quadrupole radial oscillations Ω02 were found in the hy-
drodynamic approach in [9]. They were also obtained
in [15] by considering the condensate evolution under a
weak modulation of the trap frequencies, in [16] from
the Hamiltonian of the scaling dynamics, and in [13] on
the basis of variational approach. The frequencies Ω02
and Ω−
20 were measured in the JILA experiment [4] for
β = √8 and calculated numerically for this trapping ge-
ometry in [10]. The frequencies Ω±
20 were found in the
MIT experiment [7] for β = 0.08.

Eq.(28) gives

Although the condensate frequencies Ω2m do not sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀer from those for a classical gas in the hy-
drodynamic regime (for m = 0 see [16]), the accidental
degeneracy determined by Eq.(28) is characteristic only
for the condensate. The presence of the accidental degen-
eracy can strongly inﬂuence the picture of the condensate
oscillations. The coupling between the degenerate modes
is provided by the interaction terms in the Hamiltonian
(1), proportional to ˆΨ′3 and ˆΨ′4 and omitted above in
the derivation of the Bogolyubov-De Gennes equations.
Therefore, driving only one of the degenerate modes, it
is feasible to expect the appearance of oscillations rep-
resenting a superposition of the two modes. This phe-
nomenon ensures a clear distinction between the conden-
sate oscillations and the oscillations of a classical hydro-
dynamic gas and, hence, can be a signature of BEC for
the gas in the hydrodynamic regime.

(Dated: October 28, 2013)

The quasistatic limit of the velocity-gauge strong-ﬁeld approximation describing the ionization
rate of atomic or molecular systems exposed to linear polarized laser ﬁelds is derived. It is shown that
in the low-frequency limit the ionization rate is proportional to the laser frequency, if a Coulombic
long-range interaction is present. An expression for the corresponding proportionality coeﬃcient is
given. Since neither the saddle-point approximation nor the one of a small kinetic momentum is
used in the derivation, the obtained expression represents the exact asymptotic limit. This result
is used to propose a Coulomb correction factor. Finally, the applicability of the found asymptotic
expression for non-vanishing laser frequencies is investigated.

INTRODUCTION

Keldysh-Faisal-Reiss (KFR) theories are very popular
to describe nonresonant multiphoton ionization of atoms
and molecules in intense laser ﬁelds (see, e. g., [1, 2, 3, 4]
and references therein). While the principle concept of
ignoring the eﬀect of the laser ﬁeld in the initial state
and the interaction of the ionized electron with the re-
maining atomic system in the ﬁnal state is common to all
KFR approximations, the approaches diﬀer in the details
of their formulation. Whereas the length gauge was used
in the original work of Keldysh [5], the velocity gauge
was invoked by Reiss [6] and Faisal [7]. Historically,
the velocity-gauge variant of KFR theory is also known
as strong-ﬁeld approximation (SFA) [8]. Although this
terminology is not consequently adopted nowadays, this
meaning of SFA is used in the present work that discusses
exclusively the velocity-gauge variant of KFR.

A natural test of KFR theories is a comparison of its
prediction in the tunneling limit with the corresponding
one of quasistatic theories [9, 10]. The tunneling limit
of the length-gauge version of KFR was considered al-
ready by Keldysh for the explicit example of a hydrogen
atom. In the derivation he employed, however, two ad-
ditional approximations: the one of a small kinetic mo-
mentum and the saddle-point method (SPM). In his de-
tailed work [6] about SFA theory Reiss has also used
the SPM to obtain an approximation for the general-
ized Bessel functions (’asymptotic approximation’) that
are required for the calculation of the transition ampli-
tude. As in Keldysh’ work he also adopted an expan-
sion assuming a small kinetic momentum in order to de-
rive the diﬀerential ionization rate in the tunneling limit.
The algebraically cumbersome form of the in [6] derived
’asymptotic approximation’ has motivated the develop-
ment of a simpler form appropriate for the tunneling
regime. This approximation [11] is again based on the
SPM and is referred to as ’tunneling 1 approximation’.
It was, however, recently criticized by Bauer [12] who
has shown numerically that the ’tunneling 1 approxima-
tion’ is much worse than the ’asymptotic approximation’

in the case of large kinetic momenta. Since neither [6]
nor [11] contain explicit asymptotic expressions in the
0), a systematic
limit of vanishing laser frequency (ω

cantly underestimates the ionization rate, especially in
the limit ω
0 or for very strong ﬁelds. Since both lim-
its can be well described with quasistatic theories, a com-
parison of them with the corresponding limit of SFA can
provide an insight into the reasons for such a disagree-
ment. The derivation and analysis of such an asymptotic
expression for the SFA ionization rate is the main mo-
tivation of this work. As is shown below, the SFA rate
does not converge to the tunneling result, if long-range
Coulomb interactions are present.

The asymptotic limit of SFA for ω

teresting, because it may be used for deriving a Coulomb
correction factor by comparing this limiting expression
with the one of quasistatic theories. Rescaling the SFA

rate (for ω
sistatic limit for ω
0 is supposed to correct SFA for
the otherwise neglected long-range Coulomb interaction
between the ionized electron and the remaining ion. Such
a Coulomb correction factor was proposed by Becker and
Faisal (see [1] and references therein) and is extensively
used in their atomic and molecular SFA calculations[1, 2].
Note, this correction factor is in fact very large and can
amount to almost three orders of magnitude for atomic
hydrogen and standard parameters of intense femtosec-
ond lasers. Although it is emphasized in [1] that the
low-frequency limit of SFA converges to the tunneling
result, this is only shown for the case of short-range in-
teractions. As is demonstrated in the present work, the
correct asymptotic limit of SFA in the presence of long-
range Coulomb interactions diﬀers from the short-range
case even qualitatively, since it is proportional to ω, but
ω independent for short-range potentials. Therefore, the
present work also allows to directly derive an asymptot-
ically correct Coulomb correction factor for SFA.

→

The present paper is organized the following way. Af-
ter a brief description of the ionization rate within SFA
in which the basic formulas and notations are introduced
(Sec. II A), an expression is derived in Sec. II B that is nu-
merically very convenient for the calculation of general-
ized Bessel functions and thus the SFA in the quasistatic
limit. In Sec. II C an exact asymptotic formula is derived
for the generalized Bessel functions in the limit ω
0.
In this derivation neither the SPM nor any other approx-
imation beyond the ones inherent to SFA are used and
it is demonstrated that the SPM yields wrong results for
weakly bound systems or very intense ﬁelds. In Sec. II D
two simpliﬁcations are introduced that in contrast to the
SPM or small-momentum approximation are universally
justiﬁed in the limit ω
0. This allows to derive an
exact analytical expression of the quasistatic limit of the
SFA in the presence of long-range interactions that we
name QSFA. In Sec. III the QSFA is discussed for the
example of atomic hydrogen. After a derivation of the
parameters speciﬁc to the considered atomic system in
Sec. III A, the rate obtained in the weak-ﬁeld limit is dis-
cussed and compared to tunneling models in Sec. III B.
Based on this comparison, a Coulomb correction factor
is derived for SFA and compared to an earlier proposed
one. The range of validity of QSFA for standard laser
frequencies is explored in Sec. III C where also a correc-
tion is proposed that is explicitly given for the 1S state
of hydrogenic atoms. The ﬁndings of this work are sum-
marized in Sec. IV.

sider the direct transition of an electron from the ini-
tial bound state Ψ0 to a continuum state Ψp due to the
linear polarized laser ﬁeld F(t) = F cos ωt with period
T = 2π/ω. The total ionization rate is given in the SFA

problematic to use (5) for numerical calculations, since
very many terms are required and their amplitudes are
much larger than the ﬁnal result. This can lead to large
cancellation errors. In the next subsection we solve this
problem by a transformation of the integral (2) to a form
that is more convenient for numerical calculations.

The transformations above could also be used in the con-
text of SPM, where the integration in (17) is performed
in an approximate way using an expansion of S(u) at
u = u± (see next subsection for more details). However,
the expression obtained for L within the SPM is only
approximate. Since our intention is to perform an ex-
act calculation of L (within a controllable precision), the
integration in (17) is done numerically using Gaussian
quadrature. Moreover, it is suﬃcient to calculate only
L+. Indeed, using

The next step is to substitute the summation over N by

to calculate diﬀerential rates, but due to the coupling of
qN and ζ in ρ it is impossible to obtain a simple ana-
lytical expression without the use of an expansion (e. g.
1). Instead of
the small kinetic momentum one, qN ≪

Eq. (44) is one of the central results of the present work.
It shows that the ionization rate calculated within SFA
is proportional to the frequency ω in the limit ω
0.
Thus the SFA rate vanishes in the static limit ω = 0
for all binding energies and ﬁeld strengths! Clearly, this
prediction of SFA is unphysical implying that SFA is not
applicable in the quasistatic limit for atomic systems.
As is also clear from the derivation, this conclusion is
not a consequence of the usually adopted SPM or small-
momentum approximation, since they were not adopted.

The present ﬁnding appears to be in conﬂict with the
discussion given, e. g., in [1], where it is explicitly stressed
that SFA (corresponding to the ﬁrst-order S-matrix the-
ory in velocity gauge) approaches the correct tunneling
limit for ω
0 (and suﬃciently weak ﬁelds). However,
in [1] (and corresponding references therein) this conclu-
sion is reached on the basis of a derivation valid for short-
range potentials, while the present result is obtained for
the long ranged Coulomb potential. For short-range po-
tentials the integral over χ in (46) diverges and one has
to consider the term proportional to γ2 in (25). This
term removes the divergence and the obtained limit for
the ionization rate is now ω independent in accordance
with the discussion in [1]. For long-range potentials there
is no divergence in (46), and thus (44) gives the corre-
sponding quasistatic limit of SFA for that case. Clearly,
the agreement of the SFA rate with the one predicted by
tunneling theories that is obtained for short-range poten-
tials cannot be used as a measure of the validity of the
SFA, if long-range potentials are present. However, as is
discussed below for the speciﬁc example of hydrogen-like
atoms, the QSFA results may be used together with tun-
neling theories to obtain an approximate Coulomb cor-
rection factor for SFA.

Since for long-range potentials the SFA rate leads to
unphysical results in the quasistatic limit, one would ex-
pect that there is very limited interest in its explicit
calculation. However, as is shown below, the explicit
calculation of WQSFA is not only useful for obtaining a
Coulomb correction factor, but it provides also an al-
ternative recipe for an eﬃcient though approximate cal-
culation of SFA rates for atomic and molecular systems
exposed to intense laser ﬁelds in a large range of experi-

III. QUASISTATIC LIMIT OF SFA FOR

resulting in

˜Φ(ρ, χ) =

Substitution of (50) into (46) and integration over χ
yields B1S0 = 1. The functions B(ρ) for all hydrogenic
states with principal quantum number n
3 are listed in
Appendix A. Note, for hydrogen-like states the function
B(ρ) is κ-independent and, therefore, the proportionality
coeﬃcient R is a function of τ only. The evaluation of R
according to Eq. (45) can then simply be performed nu-
merically. Since the integrand is a smooth exponentially
decaying function [this is directly evident, if the SPM ap-
proximation is adopted as in (47)], quadrature can easily
and very eﬃciently be performed with high precision.

≤

The proportionality coeﬃcients R(τ ) for a variety of
states of hydrogen-like atoms are shown in Fig. 2 for the
complete range of values of the inverse ﬁeld parameter τ .
In Fig. 2 a the range τ
1 is shown. For better visibility
the function R(τ )/√τ is plotted instead of R(τ ).
It is
worth noticing that for very small τ the R values for all
states approach 0. This is a known failure of SFA, since
a larger ﬁeld intensity to binding energy ratio (and thus
smaller τ ) should clearly result in a larger and not in a
smaller ionization rate [13].

≤

In the τ range shown in Fig. 2 a in which the R values
follow the expected behavior (decreasing R for increasing
τ ), the diﬀerent states vary rather diﬀerently as a func-
tion of τ . It is clearly visible that R depends mostly on
the quantum numbers l and m and only very weakly on
n. A diﬀerent dependence is found for large values of τ
as is discussed below.

it is possible to identify four factors that prevent an

is due to the (unphysical) ω dependence of QSFA. Also
the constant factors that depend on the quantum num-
bers n, l, and m diﬀer. For example, for ﬁxed n and
m = 0 QSFA predicts the same ionization rate for states
with diﬀerent l whereas the PPT formula predicts an l

is, however, very close to 1. Finally, both rates diﬀer in
their dependence on ﬁeld strength and binding energy
which is expressed as two factors to stress the n depen-
dence or independence.

Since QSFA is the exact asymptotic limit of SFA,
Eq. (54) can be used to derive a Coulomb-corrected SFA
rate, WCSFA = QPPT WSFA. Clearly, the factor QPPT de-
rived here explicitly for atomic hydrogen could be applied
also to other atomic or molecular systems by performing
the evident modiﬁcations like the introduction of eﬀective
quantum numbers [10], such as n∗, l∗, etc. Although the
range of validity of WCSFA for ω
= 0 is not directly evi-
dent, in contrast to WSFA it at least reaches the tunneling
limit. Already in the past eﬀorts have been made to de-
rive Coulomb-correction factors for KFR theories, but so
far the resulting rates did not lead to convincing results
(see [1] and references therein). Based on some approx-
imations, A. Becker at al. [2] have proposed a Coulomb

correction factor, C2. Using this factor, very good agree-
ment is found between experimental and theoretical SFA
ionization yields for a large number of atoms and laser
frequencies. The comparison is, however, mostly per-
formed on a qualitative level, since the experiments did
not provide absolute yields and thus the theoretical and
experimental data were adjusted at one common point.
In addition, SFA results for atomic hydrogen (with and
without C2 factor) are compared to full numerical solu-
tions of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation in [2]
and again good agreement is found (on logarithmic scale).
For atomic hydrogen one has C2 = κ6n/F 2n which cor-
responds just to the last factor in (54). Clearly, the C2-
corrected SFA rate does not approach the tunneling limit
0. However, the terms missing in C2 yield for
for ω
ω = 0.05 a. u. and the ground state of a hydrogen atom a
factor 0.5 - 1.2 for F = 0.05
0.1 a. u. This can explain
the reasonable agreement of the C2-corrected SFA results

parameters in [2]. However, the deviation increases by a
factor 10 for the CO2 laser frequency or for larger n. It
may be noted that although [2] contains also comparisons
with experimental data obtained with a CO2 laser, the
present work shows that the found agreement is due to
the fact that the comparison is made on a relative scale,
as mentioned before. In this case the erroneous ω depen-
dence of SFA (clearly not corrected by the C2 factor) is,
for example, not visible.

C. Range of validity of QSFA

As follows from the derivation, WQSFA in (44) is the
exact asymptotic form of the SFA ionization rate WSFA in
the limit ω
0. It is of course interesting to investigate
the validity regime of QSFA for non-zero values of ω. In
fact, as is shown now, QSFA provides for a wide range of

→

parameters a good approximation to SFA even for laser
wavelengths of around 800 nm or less.

Fig. 3 shows the ratio WSFA/WQSFA for the 1S state
of a hydrogenlike atom as a function of laser frequency
for nine diﬀerent values of the inverse ﬁeld parameter
τ . The variation of τ is achieved by using three dif-
ferent values for both the binding-energy related quan-
tity κ and the ﬁeld intensity F . The (reference) ioniza-
tion rate WSFA has been calculated numerically using the
scheme described in Sec. II B. All curves approach unity
0 indicating the correctness of the derivation of
for ω
QSFA as well as numerical consistency.
In the case of
the smallest shown value of the inverse ﬁeld parameter,
τ = 0.625, one notices that the ratio shows an oscillatory
behaviour that is due to channel closings that are not re-
solved in QSFA. The oscillation amplitude increases with
ω, but the ratio remains in between about 0.75 and 1.25
in the full frequency range. Therefore, QSFA is correct
to within 25%. If one averages over the oscillations, one

ﬁnds an even much better quantitative agreement be-
tween QSFA and SFA. In view of the fact that the SFA
rate is known to overestimate the eﬀect of channel clos-
ings and that these pronounced channel closing features
mostly disappear when averaging over realistic laser pa-
rameters (envelope, focal volume etc.), the QSFA can be
said to provide a very accurate approximation for the
given parameters. Note, ω = 0.1 a. u. corresponds to a
laser wave length of about 450 nm and thus the shown
frequency range covers a large range of experimentally
relevant lasers.

Increasing τ by decreasing F (but keeping κ ﬁxed)
leads to larger oscillation amplitudes while the oscillation
period increases. Most importantly, the average value of
the ratio drops with increasing ω below 1. QSFA starts
to overestimate the SFA rate. Nevertheless, the oscilla-
tion averaged QSFA rate deviates for τ = 2.5 at 800 nm
Increasing τ by increas-
from SFA by less than 25 %.
ing κ (for ﬁxed F = 0.2 a. u.) decreases the oscillation
amplitude. However, the ω averaged ratio deviates more
from unity than for smaller binding energies. Chang-
ing κ from 0.5 a. u. (corresponding to a binding energy
3.5 eV) to 1.0 a. u. (13.6 eV, hydrogen atom) and
Eb ≈
2.0 a. u. (27.2 eV, He+) changes the ratio at ω
0.1 a. u.
to about 0.75 and 2.0, respectively. From the represen-
tative examples shown in Fig. 3 one can see that these
are general trends. A decrease of F (ﬁxed κ) leads to
larger oscillation amplitudes and deviations of the aver-
aged ratio from unity. This limits the applicability of
QSFA to a smaller ω range. An increase of the binding

≈

10

energy (ﬁxed F ) damps the oscillation, but increases the
deviation from unity. Combining both results it is clear
that QSFA works best for small binding energies and high
ﬁeld strengths and thus for small values of τ . However,
τ alone is not a suﬃcient parameter to describe the va-
lidity of QSFA, as can be seen from the examples shown
for τ = 2.5 and 5.0. In this example QSFA works better
for the larger value of τ that is realized by enlarging both
Eb and F .

≤

→

In Figs. 4 and 5 the validity of the QSFA is investi-
gated for diﬀerent initial states of hydrogen-like atoms.
3. Fig. 4 shows
This includes all possible states with n
the results for F = 0.05 a. u. and κ = 0.5 a. u. These are
the same parameters as the ones used for the 1S state
in the upper left corner of Fig. 3. The results in Fig. 5
were on the other hand obtained with F = 0.1 a. u. and
κ = 1.0 a. u. and correspond therefore to the ones in the
middle of Fig. 3. Again, all ratios approach unity for
ω
0 as it should be. Comparing the results for the S
states one notices that the oscillation amplitude increases
with n, but the deviation of the ω-averaged results is very
similar. The same trend is visible within the P states (for
either m = 0 or m = 1). For a given n value the oscil-
lations are most pronounced for l = 0 and decrease with
increasing l. In view of the ω-averaged results the range
of validity of the QSFA as a function of ω shows, however,
a weaker dependence on l, but is in fact decreasing for
increasing l. For a given n and l combination (2P0 and
2P1, 3P0 and 3P1, or 3D0, 3D1, and 3D2) the ω-averaged
ratios indicate that the range of validity of the QSFA in-
creases with m. One may notice the close similarity of
the results within the series 1S0, 2P1, and 3D2, 2P0 and
3D1, as well as 2S0 and 3P1. Finally, as was the case for
the 1S state, also Figs. 4 and 5 show that a larger value
of τ decreases the oscillation amplitude and increases the
validity regime of the QSFA.

Fig. 4 shows in addition the ratio of W ap1

SFA [see Eq.(40)]
and WQSFA. The overall good agreement with the ratio
WSFA/WQSFA indicates W ap1
WSFA. Clearly, the ﬁrst
SFA ≈
step in deriving QSFA is well justiﬁed for ﬁnite frequen-
cies. Especially, the highly oscillatory behavior of the
rate due to channel closings is relatively well reproduced
by W ap1
SFA. The main reason for the deviation between
SFA and QSFA is thus due to step 2 of the derivation
which smoothes out the highly oscillatory behavior of
the rate if ω is varied.

It is instructive to investigate the main reason for the
failure of QSFA to reproduce SFA for large values of τ . It
turns out that for large τ it is most essential to consider
in Eq. (25) also the terms proportional to γ2. This yields

the 1S state of a hydrogenlike atom, κ = 2.0 a. u. and

SFA that is also not reproduced in the corrected QSFA,
the overall agreement is very good, even if the rate varies
by many orders of magnitude, if ω changes from 0 to
0.1 a. u. The results of the corrected QSFA are not only
interesting for improving the QSFA, but they also con-
ﬁrm once more that the two steps made in the derivation
of the QSFA are justiﬁed. Finally, it is worth noticing
that the range of applicability of Eq.(55) is not restricted
to a range of parameters that according to the Keldysh

parameter γ belongs to the quasistatic regime (γ
Fig. 6 shows that it works even for γ > 1.

11

On the basis of a comparison of the QSFA result with
the prediction of the Popov-Peremolov-Terent’ev (PPT)
formula a Coulomb correction factor is derived. This
factor is compared to a previously proposed one that was
supposed to be successfully adopted in a wide range of
calculations. It is discussed that part of this success may
be due to the fact that the comparisons to experimental
data was only possible on a relative scale. In this case
a number of important terms missing in the previously
proposed Coulomb correction factor is not visible.

The goal of this work has been the derivation of an
anlytical expression for the SFA in the quasistatic limit
in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions and a
discussion of the resulting QSFA in comparison to SFA.
The investigation of the validity of the SFA itself by
comparing to the results of full solutions of the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation is presently underway
and will be discussed elsewhere.

IV. CONCLUSION

Acknowledgments

The SFA (KFR theory in velocity gauge) was studied
both analytically and numerically in the quasistatic limit.
The derived analytical asymptotic expression (QSFA)
shows that in the presence of long-range Coulomb in-
teractions and thus for ionization of neutral or positively
charged atoms or molecules the SFA rate is proportional
to the laser frequency in this limit. This evidently un-
physical result indicates a break-down of the SFA. Fur-
thermore, this result shows that in contrast to the case of
short-range potentials the SFA rate does not converge to
the tunneling limit for weak ﬁelds, if long-range Coulomb
interactions are present. The analytical result is sup-
ported by a numerical study for which an eﬃcient scheme
for the numerical evaluation of the SFA transition ampli-
tude has been developed.

Using diﬀerent states of hydrogenlike atoms as an ex-
ample, the predictions of the original SFA and the QSFA
are compared to each other. It is found that QSFA allows
for a rather accurate prediction of the SFA rate even for
ﬁnite laser frequencies extending in some favorable cases
to wavelengths of 500 nm and below. It is shown that the
validity regime of the QSFA can even be extended using
a correction factor that is explicitly derived for 1S states.
The large range of applicability of the QSFA is of practi-
cal interest, since its numerical evaluation is simpler than
the one of the original SFA rate, especially in the IR and
far-IR frequency regime. Furthermore, it is very conve-
nient for studies of the frequency dependence of the SFA
rate, since the QSFA is, besides a simple proportionality
factor, ω independent. Thus the QSFA has to be eval-
uated for a given system and ﬁeld strength only once.
In turn, the relatively large range of laser frequencies in
which QSFA and SFA agree demonstrates that also the
SFA rate itself is in a wide range of laser parameters only
proportional to ω. An exception is the pronounced ω de-
pendence due to channel closings that is not reproduced
by QSFA.

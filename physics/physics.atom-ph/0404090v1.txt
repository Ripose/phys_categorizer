We report the use of an atomic magnetometer based on nonlinear magneto-optical rotation with
frequency modulated light (FM NMOR) to detect nuclear magnetization of xenon gas. The magne-
tization of a spin-exchange-polarized xenon sample (1.7 cm3 at a pressure of 5 bar, natural isotopic
abundance, polarization 1 %), prepared remotely to the detection apparatus, is measured with an
atomic sensor (which is insensitive to the leading ﬁeld of 0.45 G applied to the sample; an indepen-
dent bias ﬁeld at the sensor is 140 µG). An average magnetic ﬁeld of ∼ 10 nG induced by the xenon
sample on the 10-cm diameter atomic sensor is detected with signal-to-noise ratio ∼ 10, limited by
residual noise in the magnetic environment. The possibility of using modern atomic magnetometers
as detectors of nuclear magnetic resonance and in magnetic resonance imaging is discussed. Atomic
magnetometers appear to be ideally suited for emerging low-ﬁeld and remote-detection magnetic
resonance applications.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a versatile tech-
nique for the study of structure and dynamics on both
molecular and macroscopic scales, and on time scales
from nanoseconds to hours. Spin-polarized 129Xe (nu-
0.78 µN , where
clear spin-1/2, magnetic moment µ
µN is the nuclear magneton) is particularly well suited
for NMR and magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) stud-
ies for several reasons.
It is possible to polarize it us-
ing the laser-optical-pumping techniques [1]. In contact
with various analytes, it displays a wide range of relative
chemical shifts of up to several hundred ppm [2, 3], which
makes it an ideal probe of its local chemical environment
[4]. Finally, it has a long longitudinal relaxation time
of several minutes or longer even at low ﬁelds. Xenon
can also be used in solution, and is especially soluble in
organic solvents.

An important recent development in NMR/MRI is the
technique of remote detection [5, 6], in which informa-
tion about an analyte is transferred onto a mobile spin-
polarized substance, and is then read out at a diﬀerent
location. This technique allows the separate optimization
of the encoding and the detection environment. As the
signal in this case is the overall magnetization of the spin-
polarized sample, the task is now to read this information
out eﬃciently and with high sensitivity. Detection using
superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs)
[7] and atomic magnetometers [8] provide an alternative
to the traditional techniques involving induction detec-
tion in the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld. In fact,
SQUIDs have already proven useful in NMR experiments
[2, 9].

Atomic magnetometers (the essential components of
which consist only of a diode laser, an atomic vapor cell,

and the necessary optics and electronics) are also attrac-
tive for NMR applications as they have the potential to
be very cheap and compact and—in contrast to SQUIDs,
which require cryogenic temperatures—they operate at
room temperature. The ﬁrst use of an atomic magne-
tometer for detection of the static magnetic ﬁeld pro-
duced by a sample of gaseous nuclear-polarized atoms
was reported nearly 35 years ago in the pioneering work
of Cohen-Tannoudji et al.
In that work, a 6-cm
diam. vapor cell containing 5%-optically-polarized 3He
gas at a pressure of 3 torr was placed next to a cell of
similar dimensions containing 87Rb and serving as a sen-
sor of an optical-pumping magnetometer. The 60 nG
ﬁeld produced by the nuclear spins was detected with
10−9 G/√Hz. A similar setup was also

Modern atomic magnetometers utilizing alkali-metal
vapors in anti-relaxation-coated cells can achieve sensi-
tivities to magnetic ﬁeld better than 10−11 G/√Hz, see,
for example, Ref. [12] and review [8]. Recently, a sensi-
10−12 G/√Hz was demonstrated [13] with
tivity of 5
an atomic sensor of a volume of only 0.3 cm3 where,
instead of anti-relaxation coating, buﬀer gas was used
to reduce relaxation in wall collisions, and operation
at a high alkali-atom density ensured the rapid spin-
exchange-collision regime [14], where spin-relaxation in
collisions between alkali atoms is also reduced. Due to
such advances, the use of atomic magnetometers for low-
ﬁeld NMR experiments becomes attractive.

With a view toward future NMR applications, par-
ticularly remote detection, we have carried out ex-
ploratory measurements of samples of gaseous spin-
exchange-polarized xenon with a modiﬁed version of the

rates a 10-cm diameter spherical 87Rb-vapor cell at room
temperature with no buﬀer gas, whose inner walls are
coated [17] with paraﬃn to reduce spin relaxation in
collisions of Rb atoms with the wall. The magnetic-
ﬁeld measurement is based on the technique of nonlin-
ear magneto-optical rotation with frequency-modulated
light (FM NMOR) [15]. The key feature of the method
is the use of an ultra-narrow resonance arising when the
frequency of the light is modulated at twice the Larmor-
precession frequency of the Rb atoms (Fig. 2). The
magnetometer operates in a closed feedback loop involv-
ing digital signal processing, locking to an FM NMOR
resonance by adjusting the diode-laser-modulation fre-
quency. The mean frequency of the 4 µW laser light
delivered to the sensor is locked to the D1-resonance us-
ing a technique [18] involving an auxiliary Rb-vapor cell
(not shown). The atomic sensor cell is placed inside a
106 [19])
multi-layer magnetic shield (shielding factor
equipped with internal magnetic coils. The FM NMOR
magnetometer is intrinsically a scalar device; however, a
bias ﬁeld of 140 µG applied along the direction of light
propagation renders the sensor linearly sensitive only to
the average component of the magnetic ﬁeld produced by
the sample in that direction.

The xenon samples of natural isotopic abundance con-
taining about 26% of 129Xe were prepared using a com-
mercial spin-exchange polarizer (MITI IGI 9800 Xe). A
gas mixture of 1% Xe, 10% N2, and 89% He was used. Af-
ter polarization, xenon was removed from the gas mixture
by freezing in a cold ﬁnger that was immersed into liquid
nitrogen. At the end of the polarization process, the Xe
batch was thawed into a sapphire sample tube equipped
with a miniature titanium spring-loaded valve mecha-
nism with overall outer diameter of 6.4 mm and sample
volume dimensions of 4.8 mm inner diameter and 140 mm
length [20]. These materials were chosen to ensure a long

ter of the tube was dictated by the tight constraints given
by the geometry of the atomic magnetometer’s magnetic
shield [19]. The tube was designed for operation with gas
pressures of up to 30 bar. The xenon polarization was
measured by the polarizer’s onboard NMR spectrometer
and calibrated using thermally-polarized xenon dissolved
in pentane on a Varian Unity Inova NMR spectrometer
equipped with an Oxford 7-T magnet. The longitudi-
nal relaxation time constant T1 in the tube was found
to be T1
45 min within the 7-T magnet, and typically
<
15 min in the earth and laboratory ﬁelds. For the

A piercing solenoid (see Fig. 1) was used to apply a
leading ﬁeld of 0.45 G to the xenon sample. The setup is
designed so that the leakage ﬁeld outside of the solenoid
has negligible eﬀect on the atomic sensor; ﬁeld due to
105 smaller at
the piercing solenoid is a factor of
the vapor cell, as determined by an auxiliary measure-
ment with the atomic magnetometer (Fig. 3). During
the xenon measurement, this leakage ﬁeld provides a con-
stant magnetic ﬁeld oﬀset that is much smaller than and
transverse to the 140 µG bias ﬁeld applied to the atomic
sensor. Thus, the FM NMOR measurement is largely
insensitive to it.

ing and loaded into the magnetometer apparatus inside
the piercing solenoid (Fig. 1). Typically, it takes about
5 min between the completion of xenon gas preparation
and the beginning of the atomic magnetometer measure-
ments. Diﬀerential measurement is achieved by moving
the sample within the piercing solenoid in and out of the
position next to the Rb cell where maximal sensitivity to
the xenon magnetic ﬁeld is obtained. This modulation is
eﬀective in discriminating between the xenon magnetiza-
1 nG/min) of
tion signal and the slow drift (typically,
the magnetic ﬁeld within the shield. When the sample
tube is in the position where the atomic sensor is most
sensitive to its ﬁeld, the average magnetic ﬁeld from the
xenon magnetization over the volume of the magnetome-
ter sensor cell (equal to the ﬁeld in the center of the
cell) is a factor of 5000 smaller than the ﬁeld in the sam-
ple tube. This suppression factor was calculated from
the experimental geometry and veriﬁed experimentally
by replacing the sample cell with a calibrated solenoid of
the same dimensions, and could be greatly reduced with
a sensor geometry designed speciﬁcally for this applica-
tion. When the sample tube is moved away to the “out”
position, the suppression factor is about two orders of
magnitude larger. An example of experimental data is
shown in Fig. 4.

With a measurement time of about 3 s per point, we
detect the decay of xenon magnetization corresponding
to an initial average ﬁeld at the atomic sensor of about
10 nG with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of about 10,
clearly demonstrating the ability of the atomic sensor
to detect dc magnetization of a small gaseous sample. It
should be emphasized that the S/N obtained in this work
is many orders of magnitude lower than what one could
obtain with straightforward modiﬁcations of this tech-

FIG. 4: An example of the Xe-magnetization signal recorded
with the atomic magnetometer. Approximately every minute,
the xenon sample is moved within the solenoid between the
position of maximum and near-zero sensitivity (when the sam-
ple is partially outside of the innermost magnetic shield) of
the atomic magnetometer to the magnetic ﬁeld produced by
the sample. We have subtracted from the data the overall
slow drift due to the temperature drift-related change of the
residual magnetization of the shield. This drift is determined
from the portion of the data taken when the xenon sample is
in the position where the sensor does not feel its magnetiza-
tion. There is a slight oﬀset of the data (<∼ 1 nG) due to the
diamagnetic susceptibility of the sample tube.

nique. Perhaps most signiﬁcant would be the improve-
ment of the geometrical suppression factor from 5000 to
about 10 with optimized geometry. In addition, the mag-
netic noise in this experiment is dominated by the ﬂuc-
tuations of the magnetic ﬁeld within the magnetic shield
and exceeds the projected intrinsic sensor noise of our ap-
paratus [12, 15] of <
10−11 G/√Hz by about two orders
∼
of magnitude. This noise can be eﬀectively suppressed
(as was done, for example, in Ref. [13]) by employing a
gradiometric arrangement of magnetic sensors.

With a system consisting of two compact, high-
precision atomic magnetometers operating in gradiomet-
ric mode, it is possible to measure the magnetization of
about 1013 fully polarized nuclear (e.g., 129Xe) spins in
less than a second with a signal-to-noise of 10. The open
geometry of an atomic magnetometer equipped with a
piercing solenoid would allow measurements in which po-
larized samples can be continuously transported through
the magnetometer, an important feature for remote de-
tection experiments [5]. Commercial xenon hyperpolar-
ization systems are capable of producing over a liter of
xenon gas at 1 bar with typical polarization of
8%.
Using such a system and an optimized atomic magne-
tometer, it will be possible to make point-by-point low-
ﬁeld measurements, in which a single-point sample will

ten thousand single-point measurements to be taken in
less than an hour. Faster and/or higher resolution scans
can, in principle, be obtained by using multiple atomic
sensors in parallel, and/or by reducing the S/N.

In principle, it is also possible to perform manipula-
tions on the nuclear spins within the magnetometer, in-
cluding adiabatic spin-ﬂips, spin-echoes, etc. This capa-
bility may be of interest for ultra-low ﬁeld NMR stud-
ies (leading ﬁelds can be as low as 10−7 G limited by
the magnetic-shielding system; if necessary, much larger
leading ﬁelds than those used in this work may be applied
as well). Ultra-low ﬁeld NMR with SQUID detection has
been recently demonstrated as a powerful tool for an-
alytical chemistry [9]. A useful feature of the present
approach is the ability, due to the presence of the pierc-
ing solenoid, to apply a leading ﬁeld to the sample under
investigation and an independent bias ﬁeld to the atomic-
magnetometer sensor cell.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated reliable detection
of nuclear spin polarization of gaseous samples of spin-
exchange-polarized xenon using an atomic magnetome-
ter based on nonlinear magneto-optical rotation with
frequency-modulated light. The present apparatus is
not optimized for NMR/MRI work, and there is a large
(
5000) geometrical suppression factor that will be re-
∼
duced in a future dedicated setup. That setup will also
employ a gradiometric arrangement of atomic sensors,
thus reducing the presently dominant source of noise re-
sulting from ﬂuctuations and drift of the magnetic ﬁeld
within the magnetic shield. Estimates of the sensitivity
of such a device show its great promise as a detector for
NMR and MRI studies.

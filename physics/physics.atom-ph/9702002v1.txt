Abstract

A simple analytical solution for the problem of multiphoton detachment from

negative ions by a linearly polarized laser ﬁeld is found. It is valid in the wide

range of intensities and frequencies of the ﬁeld, from the perturbation theory

to the tunneling regime, and is applicable to the excess-photon as well as near-

threshold detachment. Practically, the formulae are valid when the number of

photons is greater than two. They produce the total detachment rates, relative

intensities of the excess-photon peaks, and photoelectron angular distributions

for the hydrogen and halogen negative ions, in agreement with those obtained

in other, more numerically involved calculations in both perturbative and non-

perturbative regimes. Our approach explains the extreme sensitivity of the

multiphoton detachment probability to the asymptotic behaviour of the bound-

state wave function. Rapid oscillations in the angular dependence of the n-

photon detachment probability are shown to arise due to interference of the

two classical trajectories which lead to the same ﬁnal state after the electron

emerges at the opposite sides of the atom when the ﬁeld is close to maximal.

I. INTRODUCTION

In this paper we present an analytical solution to the problem of multiphoton detachment

from a negative ion by a linearly polarized laser ﬁeld. It gives very reliable quantitative results

for a wide range of intensities and frequencies of the laser ﬁeld, from the weak-ﬁeld regime,

where the process is described by the perturbation theory, to the strong ﬁelds where it proceeds

as tunneling. The theory is valid when the number of photons n is large, but usually gives

good results as soon as n > 2. We use it to calculate and examine various characteristics of the

problem: the total multiphoton detachment rate, the n-photon detachment cross sections, the

spectrum of excess-photon detachment (EPD) photoelectrons (the analogue of above-threshold

ionization in atoms), and the peculiar photoelectron angular distributions.

There are two important physical properties of the multiphoton detachment process:

(i) The frequency of the laser ﬁeld is much lower than the electron binding energy,

ω

,

E0|

≪ |

where E0 =

κ2/2 is the energy of the bound state (atomic units are used throughout).

−

This means that multiphoton detachment is an adiabatic problem. The external ﬁeld varies

slowly in comparison with the period of electron motion in the system. Therefore, the general

adiabatic theory [1–3] is applicable. As long as the laser ﬁeld is weaker than the atomic ﬁeld,

the detachment probability is exponentially small with respect to the adiabaticity parameter

n.

to (ii), the ﬁnal state of the electron can be described by the Volkov wave function [4] which

2

takes into account the external ﬁeld and neglects the atomic ﬁeld. Moreover, the Volkov wave

function describes explicitly the variation of the electron energy in the laser ﬁeld. This makes

it very convenient for application of the general adiabatic theory, as suggested by (i).

Calculations based on the Volkov ﬁnal-state wave function were ﬁrst done by Keldysh [3].

Subsequently, the idea was developed by Perelomov et el [5] and later reconsidered by Faisal

[6] and Reiss [7]. This approach is usually supposed to give a correct qualitative picture of

multiphoton processes. In this paper we demonstrate that, in fact, it produces very accurate

quantitative results for the multiphoton detachment from negative ions. We re-examine and

extend the Keldysh theory, paying particular attention to the following points. First, we show

that the EPD can be accurately described by the theory. Originally, the theory was developed

for low-energy photoelectrons [3] with kinetic energies much smaller than the binding energy.

The present approach is valid at any photoelectron energy. Secondly, the angular distribution

of photoelectrons is examined in detail. We show that a nontrivial oscillatory pattern of the

angular distribution is caused by the simple and interesting physics. The photoelectron’s

escape from the atomic particle is most probable when the ﬁeld reaches its maximum. There

are two such instants in every period of the laser ﬁeld T = 2π/ω, say, t = 0 and t = T /2.

As a result, there are two classical trajectories which lead to the same ﬁnal state of the

photoelectron. Interference of the corresponding amplitudes gives rise to an oscillatory angular

dependence of the detachment rate. There is a similar eﬀect in the single-photon detachment

in the presence of a static electric ﬁeld, where the interference takes place between the two

trajectories of the electron emitted up or down ﬁeld [8,9].

Estimate (2) leads to a further simpliﬁcation of the problem, since the initial bound-state

wave function of the atomic system should also be considered at large distances, where it can

be replaced by its simple asymptotic form. The complicated behaviour of the wave function

inside the atom, and the corresponding many-electron dynamics have little inﬂuence on the

multiphoton detachment.

In contrast, use of the wave function with incorrect asymptotic

behaviour, e.g. that corresponding to the Hartree-Fock binding energy, introduces an error,

which is exponentially large with respect to √n. Such sensitivity has been noticed in the

perturbation theory calculations of the two- and three-photon detachment from H− [10].

There has been a large number of papers where multiphoton detachment from the hy-

3

drogen and halogen negative ions is investigated. Perturbation theory calculations include

those based on the Hartree-Fock approximation [11], adiabatic hyperspherical approach [10],

model potential [12], a conﬁguration-interaction procedure [13], and the Lippmann-Schwinger

equation [14]. There are also numerous non-perturbative methods, such as the Floquet close-

coupling method [15], complex-scaling generalized pseudospectral method [16], non-Hermitian

Floquet Hamiltonian method [17], and the R-matrix Floquet theory [18,19]. All the above

methods rely on much more involved numerical calculations than those needed in our analyti-

cal approach. However, we believe that the present theory provides accurate answers for most

of the multiphoton detachment problems. For illustration purposes, we reproduce a variety of

results obtained earlier, including the n-photon cross sections, total detachment probability,

EPD spectrum and photoelectron angular distributions for a large range of frequencies and

intensities of the ﬁeld (Sec. III). We believe that in some cases our results are more accurate

than those obtained previously, due to the correct asymptotic behaviour of the bound-state

wave function we use.

The good accuracy we have achieved within the Keldysh-type theory is quite useful for the

multiphoton detachment problem. On the other hand, its validity is very important for the

development of an adiabatic theory of more complicated phenomena, such as double ionization

[20–22].

The formulae obtained in this paper can be used to estimate probabilities of multiphoton

ionization of neutral atoms. However, the inﬂuence of the Coulomb ﬁeld of the positive ion

on the wave function of the photoelectron cannot be neglected [23,24], and our results for the

multiphoton ionization would be less reliable.

II. THEORY

A. Basic equations

Consider the removal of a valence electron from an atom or a negative ion by the laser ﬁeld

F(t) = F cos ωt. The diﬀerential detachment rate can be written as the sum over n-photon

of the time-dependent Shr¨odinger equation with the quasienergy Ep = p2/2 + F 2e2/4ω2. It

describes the outgoing photoelectron in the laser ﬁeld with the translational momentum p, and

F 2e2/4ω2 is the electron quiver energy due to the ﬁeld. The subscript n in Apn reminds one

that the amplitude must be calculated at Ep = E0 + nω provided by the energy conservation

in Eq. (3).

As we show below, the detachment probability is determined by the asymptotic behaviour

of the bound-state wave function at large distances. This means that the role of electron corre-

lations in the multiphoton detachment of a single electron is small, provided Φ0(r) represents

correctly the asymptotic behaviour of the true many-electron wave function of the system,

is though less physical than the length gauge in this problem. The amplitude (4) is not

gauge invariant when U(r) is neglected for the ﬁnal state (compare (11) with (15)), except

for the zero-range s-wave initial state, Φ0(r) = Ae−κr/√4π. The length gauge interaction

(6) emphasizes large distances, where the bound-state wave function Φ0(r) has a well-deﬁned

asymptotic behaviour. We will see in the next section that this gives it a major advantage over

the velocity gauge. In the limit ω

0 the length-gauge calculation reproduces the static-ﬁeld

result [25,26].

B. Adiabatic approximation

For multiphoton processes the integral over time in the amplitude (11), contains a rapidly

oscillating exponent exp[iS(ωt)], where S(ωt)

2πn is the coordinate-independent part of

This makes the amplitude Apn exponentially small, and the integral

culated using the saddle-point method. The positions of the saddle points are given by

T
0 . . . dt should be cal-
R

dS(wt)/dt = 0, which yields

(p + kt)2 + κ2 = 0 .

The saddle-point method in this problem has a simple and important physical contents. The

two terms in the right-hand side of Eq. (16) describe the energy of the electron in the initial

and ﬁnal states, E0 and (p + kt)2/2, respectively. According to the general adiabatic theory

[2], the transition from the initial into the ﬁnal state happens at the moment of time when

their energies are equal. This is exactly the meaning of Eq. (17).

Note that condition (17) coincides with the positions of singularities of the Fourier trans-

form ˜Φ0(p + kt) in the amplitude (11). Indeed, the general asymptotic form of Φ0(r) is

Φ0(r)

Arν−1 exp(

κr)Ylm(ˆr) ,

≃r≫1

−

where ν = Z/κ, Z is the charge of the atomic residue (ν = Z = 0 for the negative ion),

and ˆr = r/r is the unit vector. It is easy to see that due to (18) the Fourier transform (12)

is singular at q2 =

κ2. Using [27] we derive the following asymptotic form of ˜Φ0(q) for

Therefore, when the length-form amplitude is calculated by the saddle-point method, we

do not need to know the behaviour of the bound-state wave function in the whole space. In

contrast, when using the velocity-form amplitude (15), the value of the Fourier transform for

the true ﬁnal-state momentum p is needed. To calculate it one must know the exact wave

function at all distances including r

1. What makes the problem even harder, many-electron

correlations become essential there.

According to the general theory of adiabatic transitions [2], in the case when the ﬁnal-state

energy Ep is greater then the initial energy E0, we should take into account the two saddle-

points in the upper half-plane of complex t.

Changing the integration variable to ωt and substituting the asymptotic expression for the

Fourier transform near the singularity (19), we can write amplitude (11) as the sum over the

two saddle points,

where the integral is taken over the vicinity of the µth saddle point, ˆpµ is the unit vector in

±

for the initial electron state bound by short-range forces, as in a negative ion, the integrand

in (21) has no singularity (ν = 0), and the application of standard saddle-point formulae is

straightforward. Having the general case in mind, we will calculate the amplitude for arbitrary

ν, taking into account the singularity at the saddle point. This is also useful if one wants to

calculate the amplitude in the original form (4), without using the transformation which leads

to Eq. (11).

Using dS(ωt)/d(ωt) = [(p + kt)2 + κ2]/2ω, we can re-write Eq. (21) as

It is easier to look at the physics behind Eqs. (25)-(28) in the case when the photoelectron

where γ = κω/F is the Keldysh parameter. Thus, for small photoelectron momenta the saddle

points are ωt1 = i sinh−1 γ and ωt2 = π + i sinh−1 γ, and the detachment takes place at the

two instances when the external ﬁeld is maximal, t = 0 and T /2 on the real axis. Accordingly,

the total amplitude (25) is the sum of the two contributions from these points. This results

in oscillations in the photoelectron angular distribution, which we discuss in greater detail

below.

The original approach used in [3,5] was to expand Eqs. (26), (27) and the action (24)

in powers of p/κ to the second order (see Sec.

II D 2), thus obtaining corrections to (31).

In this regime γ remains the main parameter which determines the probability of multipho-

ton detachment [29]. However, the applicability of the saddle-point result (25) is essentially

narrowed by such expansion (Sec. III).

The adiabatic nature of the problem allows us to estimate the radial distances which are

important in the multiphoton detachment process. We have already seen that the saddle

points in the integral in (11) coincide with the poles of the Fourier transform ˜Φ0(q). The form

of ˜Φ0(q) at q

estimate (2). It is important that R

1 in both weak- and strong-ﬁeld regimes. This makes

≫

the Keldysh approach valid for short-range potentials. There is another physical reason which

helps to understand why the atomic potential can be neglected for the photoelectron. When a

large number of photons is absorbed by the photoelectron, higher angular momentum partial

waves are populated. The inﬂuence of the short-range potential upon them is small. For

10

a given electron momentum p the important l values can be estimated as l

pR. In the

perturbation theory regime this estimate yields l

(p/κ)√n, which suggests that the spread

∼

of the probability to ﬁnd the photoelectron with given l is described by a random walk of n

steps.

Estimate (2) also explains the extreme sensitivity of the multiphoton detachment rates

to the asymptotic behaviour of the bound-state wave function. Suppose a bound state wave

function characterised by κ′ instead of the true κ is used. The error in the amplitude (4)

introduced by replacing κ by κ′ comes in as a factor exp[

∆κR], where ∆κ = κ′

κ. The value

−

of R is large, thus, even a small ∆κ can produce an exponential error in the amplitude. Using

the perturbation-theory regime estimate of R we obtain the error factor of exp[

2(∆κ/κ)√2n]

for the detachment rate.

The total n-photon detachment rate of the lm state is obtained by integrating (33),

and if we are interested in the total detachment rate for a closed shell, the sum over m and

the electron spin projections must be completed,

The dominant contribution to this sum is given by the m = 0 state, since it is extended along

the direction of the ﬁeld, see Sec. II D 2.

Of course, one can easily obtain the total detachment rate by summing the n-photon rates

There are two limits which can be usefully explored with the help of Eq. (33). The ﬁrst

is the perturbation theory limit, where the detachment rate is proportional to the nth power

of the photon ﬂux J = cF 2/(8πω), and the process is described by the generalized n-photon

cross section

The other is the low photoelectron energy limit studied earlier in [3,5].

It enables one to

recover the static-ﬁeld results [25,26].

To obtain the perturbation-theory limit, it is convenient to re-write the saddle-point equa-

tion (26) for sin ωtµ in the following form:

This formula coincides Eq. (53) of Ref. [5]. The cos(. . .) in the last square brackets of Eq. (42)

appears due to the interference between the contributions of the two saddle points in amplitude

(25), and is the analogue of cos Ξ in Eq. (40). It determines the oscillatory behaviour of the

angular dependence of the n-photon detachment rate, which would otherwise simply peak

along the direction of the ﬁeld, θ = 0, or θ = π, for m = 0.

Formula (42) also shows clearly that the detachment rate for the states with m

= 0 is

much smaller than that of m = 0, due to the factor (p sin θ/κ)2|m|. It comes from the leading

term in the expansion of the associated Legendre polynomial P |m|

for negative ion case ν = 0. It has been shown recently [30] that the account of the polarization

potential

αe2/2r4 acting between the outer electron and the atomic residue in the negative

ion, changes the numerical pre-exponential factor in Eq. (43). However, this correction is not

very large, e.g., it increases the detachment rate for Ca− by a factor of 2, in spite of the large

polarizability α(Ca) = 170 a.u.

It is worth noting that the perturbation theory formula (40) and the low electron energy

limit (42) have a common range of applicability. If we use p

κ in the ﬁrst, and take the

perturbation theory limit γ

1 in the second, the two formulae yield identical results.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section we use the formulae we obtained within the adiabatic theory to calculate

the photodetachment rates, EPD spectra and photoelectron angular distributions for H− and

halogen negative ions. These are so far the most studied species, which enables us to make

comparisons with results of other calculations. Our aim is to show that our theory achieves

good accuracy in describing multiphoton detachment in both perturbative and strong-ﬁeld

regimes.

κ =

E0|

|

2
q

To apply the theory, all we need is the asymptotic parameters A and κ of the corresponding

bound-state wave functions. The values of A are tabulated in various sources, and we use

those from [32]. The values of κ are calculated using the corresponding binding energies,

. They are taken from the electron aﬃnity tables [33], or obtained by combining

those with the ﬁne-structure intervals of the atomic ground states [34], when we consider the

detachment of p1/2 electrons from the halogens.

In Fig. 1 we present the generalized n-photon detachment cross sections for H− obtained

by integrating the diﬀerential cross sections from Eq. (40) with A = 0.75 and κ = 0.2354

over θ. The cross section has been multiplied by 2 to account for the two spin states [cf.

Eq. (36) with l = 0, j = 1/2]. The results of the perturbation theory calculations [12] are

14

shown for comparison. In the latter the interaction of the electron with the atomic core was

described by a model potential which accounted for the polarizational attraction between the

electron and the atomic core, and was chosen to reproduce the binding energy of H−, as well

as the electron-hydrogen scattering phaseshifts. Figure 1 shows that there is good agreement

between our results and those of [12]. We checked that even for n = 3 the diﬀerence does not

exceed 20% at the cross section maximum.

Laughlin and Chu note [12] that their model-potential results are close to those obtained in

[10] using the hyperspherical method which accounts for correlations between the two electrons

in H−. They are also in agreement with the two-electron perturbation theory calculations of

[14] and the recent R-matrix Floquet theory calculations [18], which also take into account

electron correlations. The main idea behind those approaches was to reproduce the negative

ion wave function as correctly as possible at all distances, particularly near the atomic core.

This idea is favoured by the experience gained in a number of problems, such as the single-

photon detachment, electron-atom scattering, etc., where electron correlations are indeed very

important. However, as shown above, the multiphoton problem under consideration proves to

be diﬀerent. Absorption of several quanta is dominated by large distances satisfying inequality

(2). The complicated behaviour of the wave function inside the atomic core turns out to be

inessential. This is the main reason for the good agreement we observe in Fig. 1.

To check our theory in the non-perturbative regime, where one must use Eq. (33), the

EPD spectra of H− for the three large ﬁeld intensities I = 1010, 5

1010, and 1011 W/cm2,

×

of the 10.6-µm radiation, ω = 0.0043 a.u., are presented in Table I. For these parameters the

electron quiver energy, or the ponderomotive energy shift, in units of ω, z = F 2/4ω3 = 0.894,

4.472, and 8.945, and the Keldysh parameter γ = 1.895, 0.847, and 0.599, respectively. For

given ω absorption of a minimum of 7 photons is required. The ponderomotive threshold shift

changes this number to nmin = 8, 11, and 16. The calculation of the detachment rates from

Eqs. (33)–(36) has been done using Mathematica [31]. For the smallest intensity the lowest

EPD peak n = 8 dominates the total detachment rate, whereas for the higher intensities many

peaks in the EPD spectrum can be observed.

The detachment rates in Table I are compared with those obtained in the non-perturbative

calculations of Telnov and Chu [17]. They describe their method as a complex-scaling general-

15

ized pseudospectral technique applied to the solution of the time-independent non-Hermitian

Floquet Hamiltonian for the complex quasienergies, and use the accurate model potential

from [12] to describe the interaction of the electron with the atomic residue.

There is a good overall agreement between the two calculations. The discrepancy usually

does not exceed a few per cent, and is slightly larger for higher EPD peaks and smaller

ﬁeld intensities. The latter is somewhat puzzling, since there is a good agreement in the

perturbation-theory limit for the 7-photon cross section at ω = 0.0043 a.u.:

σ7 = 3.537

10−200 cm14s6

(Eq. (40) integrated over angles),

σ7 = 3.639

10−200 cm14s6

(result of [17]).

×

In Fig. 2 we show the angular dependence of the photoelectron peaks for n = 16, 17, 18,

and 19, at I = 1011 W/cm2. We have checked that their shapes, as well as those for other n

and intensities, are practically identical to the angular distributions presented in Figs. 5–7 of

[17]. Also shown in Fig. 2 are the diﬀerential detachment rates obtained from Eq. (42). It

works quite well for two lowest n, but the agreement becomes poor with the increase of the

photoelectron energy, e.g., for n = 19, where p/κ

0.75.

≈

It is worth stressing again that the remarkable oscillatory behaviour is caused by the inter-

ference of the two saddle-point contributions in Eq. (33), or in other words, the interference

between the electron waves emitted at the two instants separated by T /2, when the ﬁeld

reaches its maximum. The geometrical phase diﬀerence which determines the oscillations of

cos(. . .) in Eq. (42) can be calculated classically. Suppose that the electron is considered free

at the moment when it escapes the atomic particle. Its classical coordinate is then given by

r(t) =

t kt′dt′ = (F/ω2) cos ωt. At the two instants tµ when the adiabatic transition takes

r(tµ) =

where Eq. (31) is used for small momenta p

κ. Note that though tµ are complex, the

corresponding electron coordinates are real. These points located at the opposite sides of the

atomic particle, are sources of the two electron waves emitted at the angle θ with respect to

F. The geometrical phase is obtained by multiplying the base

r(t1)

r(t2)

by the projection

of the electron momentum on the the direction of the ﬁeld p cos θ.

Our results for halogen negative ions are presented in Fig. 3 and Table II. They have been

obtained from Eqs. (40), (36) for comparison with the perturbation theory calculations [11]

at the Nd:YAG laser frequency ω = 0.0428 a.u. In that work the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock

wave functions of the valence np electrons were used, together with experimental threshold

energies. The photoelectron was described in the plane wave approximation. This approxi-

mation is equivalent to our use of the Volkov wave function in the perturbation-theory limit.

As shown in the earlier works by Crance [35], the multiphoton detachment results obtained in

the plane wave approximation are close to those obtained using the frozen core Hartree-Fock

wave functions of the photoelectron.

The shapes of angular distributions presented in Fig. 3 are quite close to those in Fig. 2

of Ref. [11], although quantitative comparison is not feasible due to the use of an arbitrary

vertical scale in [11].

The absolute values of the n-photon detachment cross sections in from our calculations and

[11] compare reasonably on a logarithmic scale for all cases shown in Table II. However,there

is a systematic discrepancy. To ﬁnd its origin let us recall that the multiphoton detachment

rate is very sensitive to the asymptotic behaviour of the bound-state wave function (see end

of Sec.

II B).

In [11] the Hartree-Fock wave functions have been used. Their asymptotic

behaviour exp(

κhf r) is diﬀerent from the correct exp(

κr), based on the experimental value

−

−

of κ. Thus, to account for the discrepancy in Table II, the Hartree-Fock based results should

be multiplied by the factor

exp[2(κhf −

∼

κ)R] ,

(44)

where, according to (2), R

1/√ω. Formula (44) shows that when κhf > κ, the Hartree-Fock

≈

based calculations underestimate the detachment rate, while for κhf < κ they overestimate it.

The Hartree-Fock values of κhf are 0.602, 0.545, 0.528, and 0.508, for the outer np subshell

of F−, Cl−, Br−, and I−, respectively. Examination of the lowest n cross sections throughout

Table II shows that the qualitative explanation of the discrepancy based on (44) is correct.

For example, for F− where κhf = 0.6 and κ = 0.5, formula (44) gives 2.6, whereas the ratio

of the 3-photon detachment cross sections for F−, j = 3/2, in Table II is 4.3. Also, the best

agreement in Table II is achieved for Br−, j = 1/2, where κhf is very close to the correct

value. Therefore, we conclude that the incorrect asymptotic behaviour of the Hartree-Fock

17

wave functions can produce signiﬁcant errors in the multiphoton detachment rates. This

must be kept in mind when comparisons are made between diﬀerent n-photon detachment

calculations [19].

IV. SUMMARY

The main result of our work is that the adiabatic theory approach to the multiphoton

problems originally suggested by Keldysh, is more powerful and accurate than is generally

believed.

It yields accurate multiphoton detachment rates for negative ions, and reveals a

number of interesting details about the physics of the problem: the role of large distances and

asymptotic behaviour of the bound-state wave function, and the origin of oscillations in the

angular distribution of photoelectrons. The formulae obtained in the paper allow one to make

simple and reliable estimates of the n-photon detachment rates for n > 2 in both perturbative

and non-perturbative regimes.

[29] Note that the ﬁnal answer for the probability presented in [3] [Eq. (16)] is two times

smaller than one would get from (25), neglecting the interference between the two terms.

This possibly means that the contribution of only one saddle point has been taken into

account in [3].

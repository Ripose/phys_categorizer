We report the best ﬁgure-of-merit achieved for an internal nuclear polarized hydro-

gen gas target and a Monte Carlo simulation of spin-exchange optical pumping. The

dimensions of the apparatus were optimized using the simulation and the experimen-

tal results were in good agreement with the simulation. The best result achieved for

this target was 50.5% polarization with 58.2% degree of dissociation of the sample

beam exiting the storage cell at a hydrogen ﬂow rate of 1.1

1018 atoms/s.

The exploitation of polarization observables through the use of polarized beams and po-

larized internal gas targets in storage rings is an increasingly valuable technique in nuclear

and particle physics. Nucleon properties, such as the spin structure functions and the elec-

tromagnetic form factors, have been measured in recent years with polarization techniques

utilizing polarized internal targets at DESY (HERMES), NIKHEF and the MIT-Bates Lab-

oratory. The spin-dependent asymmetry from the ~p + ~p

p + p + φ process has been

suggested [1, 2] as a possible probe of the strangeness content of the nucleon. The near
Y + Θ+ process could be used to determine the parity of the Θ+ pen-

threshold ~p + ~p

taquark state [3, 4, 5], if its existence is conﬁrmed.

The Laser-Driven Target (LDT) is capable of producing nuclear polarized hydrogen and

deuterium for storage rings. The LDT and the Atomic Beam Source (ABS) (another tech-

nique more commonly used) both use storage cells [6] to increase the target thickness, com-

pared to a free gas jet target. However, the LDT oﬀers a more compact design than the ABS,

and can provide a higher Figure of Merit (FOM) [30] as reported in this work. An LDT was

ﬁrst used in nuclear physics experiments [7, 8] in 1997 and 1998 at the Indiana University

Cyclotron Facility following earlier work on the laser-driven source and target [9, 10, 11, 12].

2

A hydrogen LDT project was initiated at MIT in late 1990s with the goal of implementing

such a target in the South Hall Ring at the MIT-Bates Linear Accelerator Center for a

precision measurement of the proton charge radius [13, 14]. In this paper we report the best

FOM result obtained from this target, which beneﬁted from the development of a realistic

Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the target.

A LDT is based on the technique of spin-exchange optical pumping. The valence electron

of potassium is polarized through optical pumping in a magnetic ﬁeld of

1 kG using

∼

circularly polarized laser light. Spin exchange collisions then transfer the polarization from

potassium to the Hydrogen (H) electron. Finally, the hyperﬁne interaction during H-H

collisions transfers the electron spin to the nucleus [15, 16]. If there are many H-H collisions,

the rate of transfer of spin to the nucleus equals the reverse rate, and the system is in Spin

Temperature Equilibrium (STE) [17]. The time-constant for STE is approximately given

by [17]:

τST E =

1 + (B/Bc)

where Bc is the critical magnetic ﬁeld (507 G for hydrogen), nH is the density of atomic

velocity between hydrogen atoms. Laser-driven sources and targets are designed with the

dwell time-constant in the spin-exchange cell much greater than the STE time-constant

to guarantee that the system is in STE. Moreover, STE has been veriﬁed in laser-driven

sources and targets [18, 19, 20]. Under STE conditions, the hydrogen nuclear and electron

polarizations are equal [18].

The main contributions to depolarization of the alkali and hydrogen in our apparatus

come from the ﬂow of atoms into and out of the LDS and depolarization during wall colli-

sions [21]. Atoms may also recombine at a surface producing molecules with predominantly

zero net nuclear spin. The recombination is characterized by the degree of dissociation, fα,

which is the fraction of the hydrogen ﬂux in the sample beam exiting the storage cell that is

in atomic form. Driﬁlm coatings are employed to limit the recombination and depolarization

eﬀects from wall collisions [22]. The depolarization from radiation trapping [23, 24] can be

limited by optical pumping in a large magnetic ﬁeld in the kG range [17]; however, the rate

of transfer of spin to the nucleus by the hyperﬁne interaction is reduced. Therefore, the

beam can be used to measure the alkali density and polarization via a Faraday polarimeter.

magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld in the spin-exchange cell must be optimized for these two

competing eﬀects [17, 21, 25].

Figure 1 is a schematic view of the MIT LDT. Hydrogen gas ﬂows successively into

diﬀerent sections of a piece of pyrex glassware (which consists of a dissociator tube, a spin-

exchange cell and a transport tube) and an aluminum storage cell. The molecular gas is

dissociated into atoms by an RF discharge in the dissociator tube. In the spin-exchange

cell the hydrogen gas (now a mixture of atoms and molecules) is mixed with the potassium

vapor produced in a side-arm by heating a potassium ampoule. The results from two spin-

exchange cells, “Original” and “Large-1”, are reported herein. To minimize the number of

wall collisions, the Original spin-exchange cell design was spherical with an inner diameter

of 4.8 cm. Large-1 was a cylindrical cell optimized by the MC simulation described below.

The entire volume contained by the spin-exchange cell, transport tube and storage cell must
be heated to 200–250◦C to prevent the alkali-metal vapor from condensing on the walls,

which would degrade the driﬁlm coating. The potassium number density is typically 0.3%

compared to H. The standard storage cell is an open ended aluminum cylinder coated with

4

driﬁlm. The cell is 40 cm in length, and 1.25 cm in diameter with two sampling holes allowing

the target gas to be monitored by an atomic polarimeter. One hole is centered and the other

one is 15 mm downstream. Both are positioned at right angles to the entrance hole of the

storage cell, which ensures that the atoms monitored by the atomic polarimeter undergo

wall collisions in the storage cell before escaping the cell. A MC simulation determined that

atoms that exit the center (oﬀ-center) sampling hole experience, on average, 1370 (1370)

wall collisions of which 135 (155) wall collisions are in the storage cell.

The laser used is a Titanium-Sapphire laser (Ti:Sapph) pumped with a 20 W Argon

ion laser. The laser beam passes through an Electro-Optic Modulator (EOM, not shown),

an expanding lens, and a quarter-wave plate before arriving at the spin-exchange cell via

a periscope with two polarization-preserving mirrors. The EOM broadens the relatively

narrow linewidth of the Ti:Sapph laser to provide a better match to the potassium Doppler

absorption proﬁle with a FWHM of 1.0 GHz. In addition, two sampling beams are split oﬀ

from the pump beam for monitoring the laser spectrum and wavelength.

Gas exiting the sampling hole of the storage cell is collimated through a series of apertures

which also serve as conductance limiters between sub-chambers of the polarimeter. A per-

manent sextupole magnet focuses one electronic spin state of the atomic beam and defocuses

the other. The optimal focal length was determined by an atomic beam simulation. The

beam is then sampled by a Quadrupole Mass Analyzer (QMA) which alternately measures

both the atomic and molecular intensities. The QMA is shielded from the holding ﬁeld by

two layers of µ-metal. The small signal at
1 m from the storage cell is enhanced using a
∼
chopper along with a lock-in ampliﬁer. The background pressure is reduced to 10−9 Torr

by diﬀerentially pumping the two sub-chambers with ion pumps and also a NEG pump in

the second (QMA) chamber. The background can be measured by blocking the beam with

a shutter or moving/rotating the polarimeter away from the sampling hole.

The degree of dissociation of the sample beam exiting the storage cell is given by the

change in the molecular signal (after subtracting the background) when the RF discharge is

turned on and oﬀ. The electron polarization of the atomic hydrogen species, Pe, is given by

the change in the atomic signal when the laser is turned on and oﬀ by opening or closing

a laser shutter (after subtracting the background). This measurement also indicates the

hydrogen nuclear polarization, as the system is designed to be in STE. The mean dwell

time for atomic hydrogen in the Original spin-exchange cell and transport tube has been

The mean dwell time is therefore larger than the STE time constant by a factor of approx-

the nuclear polarization [18] in conditions where the mean dwell time was larger than the

STE time-constant by a factor of 300, and the system was expected to remain in STE at

half that ratio.

The best results achieved by the MIT LDT in the Original conﬁguration are shown in

Fig. 2 together with the overall errors which are dominated by the systematic errors. The

combined systematic uncertainty in the FOM is estimated to be 8.4%, which is dominated

by the non-linearity in the QMA response (less than 3%), hydrogen ﬂow control (4%), and

3% in the density averaged target polarization. The measurements were repeated several

times for this cell geometry under various conditions, including recoating the surface, with

reproducible results.

A detailed MC simulation of optical pumping and spin-exchange collisions for our target

was developed and used to extract the recombination and depolarization coeﬃcients, and

to provide a new cell design to improve the target performance. The simulation techniques

developed for the LDT are also applicable to the design of the ABS, particularly at future

facilities where constraints may cause signiﬁcant recombination and/or spin-exchange. The

recombination coeﬃcient, γr(nH), is the probability for a hydrogen atom to recombine at a

wall collision and is a function of nH near the surface. As nH varies throughout the simulated

volume, γr changes with position on the surfaces.

In the simulation, a hydrogen atom moves ballistically between wall collisions in the

spin-exchange cell, transport tube and storage cell. A new velocity, both magnitude and

7

(3)

direction, is randomly generated after each wall collision, according to a Maxwellian and

a cos Θ distribution, respectively, where Θ is the polar angle measured with respect to

the normal to the surface. At high temperatures, which are experienced in an LDT, the

recombination coeﬃcient, γr, is given by [29]

γr(nH) = CHnH,

where CH is a constant. After the hydrogen atom exited either through a sampling hole

or the ends of the storage cell, another hydrogen atom was generated at the top of the

spin-exchange cell.

The MC was used to determine nH throughout the apparatus. As nH depends on the

average probability that atoms have not recombined at a given point, and this probability

depends on nH through Equation 3, the simulation was iterated and nH recalculated after

each iteration until the degree of dissociation of atoms exiting the storage cell sampling hole

and nH converged.

Although the hydrogen atoms were transported separately, H-H and H-K spin-exchange

collisions were treated by allowing the hydrogen atoms to interact with the average hydrogen

electron and nuclear polarization and potassium electron polarization. The apparatus was
2 mm3 grid. Initial values of the average H and K

polarizations were assigned at every point on the grid. After a hydrogen atom exited the

apparatus in the simulation, the average polarizations were updated, and the simulation was

iterated until convergence. A hydrogen atom can be depolarized during a wall collision with

the probability given by the depolarization coeﬃcient, γp. The MC results were ﬁt to the

experimental results for the Original conﬁguration, shown in Table I, by varying CH and γp,
10−18 cm3 and 0.00355 respectively. Further discussion

which were determined to be 3.33

×

of the MC simulation will be reported in a forthcoming paper.

A cylindrical spin-exchange cell with a much larger diameter was constructed based on

the MC studies and the practical constraints of our target chamber. The calculated mean

dwell time divided by the STE time constant was 280. This design, labeled Large-1 in

Table I, has a spin-exchange cell volume 6.8 times larger than that of the Original design.

The best result obtained for this cell using the EOM was Pe = 50.5% and fα = 58.2% at a
1018 atoms/s. These results are in good agreement with the MC simulation,

ﬂow rate of 1.1

×

which predicted Pe = 57% and fα = 51% at the same ﬂow rate.

8

While in the Original conﬁguration, driﬁlm coatings were found to last in excess of 100

hours under operating conditions. The polarization result for the Large-1 cell was stable at

50% polarization for about 12 hours but with rather rapid deterioration of the dissociation

fraction. This observation may have been due to uneven heating of the spin-exchange cell

and the transport tube. For the Large-1 geometry, there was only a 1 cm gap for the hot

air to circulate around the glass due to the constraint of the existing target chamber. One

can overcome this constraint with the design of a new target chamber.

One may argue that it is probably not completely justiﬁed to compare the performance

of the HERMES ABS target and the IUCF LDT with the FOM of the LDT obtained in

our polarized target lab due to the diﬀerence in the storage cell conductances. A detailed

study shows that minimal modiﬁcations are needed for the installation of this target in the

MIT-Bates storage ring. A more realistic comparison which takes into account correction

factors due to the target geometry, temperature and molecules still shows that our target

with the Large-1 cell geometry has (33

11)% higher ﬁgure of merit than that of the

±

HERMES hydrogen target. These results represent an even larger improvement compared

to the previous best FOM from an LDT, which was obtained at IUCF. A similar comparison

that does not bias toward the MIT LDT due to the storage cell conductance is (210

30)%

±

higher than the IUCF result. These comparisons will be explained in a forthcoming paper.

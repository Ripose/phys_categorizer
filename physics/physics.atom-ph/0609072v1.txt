Abstract. The photorecombination spectrum of 48Ti18+ was measured employing the merged
electron-ion beams technique at a heavy-ion storage ring. The experimental electron-ion collision
energy range 0−80 eV comprises all dielectronic recombination (DR) resonances associated with
2s → 2p (∆N = 0) core excitations as well as trielectronic recombination (TR) resonances that
involve 2s2 → 2p2 core double-excitations. At low collision energies DR resonances are observed
that are associated with the excitation of metastable 2s 2p 3P0 primary ions with nearly inﬁnite
lifetime for the isotope 48Ti with zero nuclear spin. For the isotope 47Ti with nonzero nuclear
spin hyperﬁne quenching of these resonances occurs. The procedure for obtaining the associated
time constant from a recombination measurement is outlined.

1. Introduction
The ns np 3P0 state in divalent atoms and ions is the ﬁrst excited state above the ns2 1S0
ground state. Its decay by a one-photon J = 0 → J = 0 transition is strictly forbidden and
the lifetime of the 3P0 state is nearly inﬁnite provided the ion has zero nuclear spin (I = 0).
If I > 0 the hyperﬁne interaction mixes levels with diﬀerent J and, consequently, the 3P0 level
acquires a ﬁnite lifetime. This hyperﬁne quenching has been treated theoretically for Be-like,
Mg-like and Zn-like ions [1, 2, 3, 4]. Theoretical work on neutral alkaline-earth-metal atoms [5, 6]
was motivated by the idea to use the hyperﬁne induced 3P0 → 1S0 transition in ultraprecise
atomic clocks. In another application the 13C2+(3P0 → 1S0) ﬂuorescence from planetary nebulae
was measured to infer the 13C/12C abundance ratio and, thereby, to gain insight into stellar
nucleosynthesis [7].

So far, the only experimental values for ns np 3P0 → ns2 1S0 hyperﬁne induced (HFI)
transition rates were obtained for In+ (n=5) [8] stored in a radio frequency trap and for Be-like
N3+ from astrophysical observations [9]. Although the latter result had a rather large uncertainty
of ±33%, it allows one to discriminate between the two theoretical values [1, 3] that are available
for this ion and that diﬀer by almost a factor of 4. In view of these theoretical uncertainties it is
evident that accurate experimental benchmarks are highly desirable, especially for few electron
systems such as Be-like ions where correlation eﬀects are particularly strong.

In the present work the hyperﬁne quenching of the 2s 2p 3P0 state of Be-like 47Ti18+
was observed in dielectronic recombination (DR) experiments carried out at the heavy-ion

The procedure for obtaining the associated decay constant from electron-ion recombination
measurements is outlined. The result will be published elsewhere [10]. Here, the Ti18+
recombination spectrum is presented and its isotope-dependence is discussed.

2. Experiment
Mass selected 47,48Ti18+ ion beams (natural abundances 7.2% and 73.7%, respectively) were
provided by a tandem accelerator, followed by a radio frequency linear accelerator, at energies
close to 240 MeV, using a ﬁxed magnetic setting for the beam line and the storage ring. In one
straight section of the storage ring the ion beam was continuously phase-space cooled using the
velocity-matched electron beam of the TSR electron cooler. In a second straight section, the ion
beam was merged with the collinear electron beam of the high-resolution electron target [11],
run at variable acceleration voltage in order to set the required collision energy in the co-moving
≈ 40 µeV and
reference frame of the ions. The target electron beam temperatures were kTk
kT⊥ ≈ 4 meV. Ti17+ ions formed by electron-ion recombination in the electron target or by
charge transfer in collisions with residual gas molecules were deﬂected out of the closed orbit of
the circulating Ti18+ ion beam in the ﬁrst dipole magnet downstream of the electron target and
were directed onto a scintillation detector operated in single-particle counting mode with nearly
100% detection eﬃciency.

Recombination spectra of the Ti18+ ions as a function of the relative electron-ion energy were
taken by varying the cathode voltage of the electron target appropriately. The procedure for
electron-ion measurements at the TSR storage ring has been described in more detail in, e. g.,
Ref. [12] (and references therein). For the present spectral measurements, a constant current of
cooled, circulating Ti18+ ions was maintained. Currents of a fraction of a µA were injected at a
rate of ≈1 s−1 in order to obtain stationary stored currents of ≈40 µA for 48Ti18+ and ≈6 µA
for 47Ti18+, respectively; this largely reﬂects the diﬀerence in the natural isotope abundances.

3. Results and discussion
An overview over the measured 48Ti18+ recombination spectrum is presented in ﬁgure 1. The
energy range 0–80 eV comprises all resonances associated with 2s → 2p (∆N = 0) core
excitations. The spectrum is similar to the previously measured ones of the isoelectronic ions
Cl13+ [14] and Fe22+ [15]. At higher energies it is dominated by the regular Rydberg series of
2s2 1S0 → (2s 2p 1P1) nℓ DR resonances converging to the 2s 2p 1P1 series limit at 73.11 eV [13].
The 2s 2p 3PJ series limits are barely visible. They are expected to occur at 35.73, 37.77, and
43.05 eV for J = 0, 1, and 2, respectively. At lower energies the spectrum is more irregular due
to the larger ﬁne-structure splitting of the lower-n resonances. Some resonance features, e. g.,
at 23.6 and 34.0 eV can be related to 2s2 → 2p2 core double-excitations. A thorough discussion
of these trielectronic recombination (TR) resonances can be found elsewhere [14].

In single-pass merged-beams electron-ion recombination experiments with lower charged Be-
like C2+, O4+, and F5+ ions, strong Rydberg series of DR resonances were observed associated
with 2s 2p 3P → 2s 2p 1P and 2s 2p 3P → 2p2 3P core excitations of metastable 2s 2p 3P
primary ions [16]. In these experiments the metastable 3P fraction in the primary ion beams
amounted up to ≈70%. In the present 48Ti18+ recombination spectrum analog strong resonance
features are absent. The J = 1 and J = 2 levels of the Ti18+(2s 2p 3P ) term have theoretical
lifetimes of 74 ns and 1 ms, respectively [17], much shorter than the average storage lifetime
(≈50 s). Thus, the major fraction of the initially present metastable ions decayed to the ground
state very fast on the time scale of the experiment, and the remaining (inﬁnitely) long-lived 3P0
metastable fraction amounted to only ≈5% (see below). In the single-pass experiments, however,
typical ﬂight times were of the order of several µs, i. e., much shorter than the lifetimes of the
3P1 and 3P2 states. For lower charged ions these lifetimes are even larger than the values given

decaying 3P1 component of the 3P term was contained in the primary beams of the single-pass
experiments.

In the present experiment DR resonances associated with the excitation of the metastable
3P0 fraction of the primary ion beam are only observed at low electron-ion collision energies.

population of ≈5% for the metastable Ti18+(2s2p 3P0) ions in the stored 48Ti18+ beam.

Using a 47Ti18+ beam the resonances assigned to metastable Ti18+(2s2p 3P0) ions essentially
disappear [Fig. 2(b)]. Their average population is strongly reduced through the 2s 2p 3P0 →
2s2 1S0 HFI radiative decay. The isotope-dependent occurrence of resonances in a DR spectrum
was also observed in earlier TSR experiments, using the heavier divalent ion Pt48+ (Zn-like)
[19]. Here, resonances due to 4s 4p 3P0 were seen for 194Pt48+ and disappeared for 195Pt48+. A
measurement of the optical decay lifetime, predicted to be 0.2971 ms [20], was not attempted
as, in contrast to the present case, it should be much shorter than the time needed for electron
cooling of the ion beam. In the present case of 47Ti18+ the theoretical value for the HFI decay
rate of the 3P0 state is τHFI = 2.8 s [1] so that a sizeable 3P0 fraction can be expected in the ion
beam even after cooling for some 100 ms.

For the experimental determination of τHFI the decay of the 47Ti18+(3P0) beam component
was monitored as a function of storage time. To this end the relative electron-ion energy in the
electron target was set ﬁxed to 0.75 eV where the 2s 2p 3P0 → (2s 2p 1P1) 11d DR resonance
associated with excitation of the 3P0 state occurs (ﬁgure 2). After injection of a single Ti18+
ion pulse into the storage ring the recombination rate was recorded for up to 200 s. Prior to
the injection of the next pulse the remaining ions were kicked out of the ring. This scheme
was repeated for a suﬃcient number of times to reduce statistical uncertainties to a level as
low as achievable within one week of beam time. This method had been applied previously
for measuring the slow radiative decay rates of 1s 2s 3S states in the He-like ions (B3+, C4+,
N5+ [21] and Li+ [22]). The experimental result for τHFI of the 47Ti18+(2s 2p 3P0) state will be
presented and discussed in a forthcoming publication [10].

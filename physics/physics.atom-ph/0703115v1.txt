Ferrite materials provide magnetic shielding performance similar to commonly used high perme-
ability metals but have lower intrinsic magnetic noise generated by thermal Johnson currents due
to their high electrical resistivity. Measurements of magnetic ﬁelds inside a ferrite shield with a
−1/2,
spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) atomic magnetometer reveal a noise level of 0.75 fT Hz
25 times lower than would be expected in a comparable µ-metal shield. We also identify a 1/f
component of magnetic noise due to magnetization ﬂuctuations and derive general relationships
for the Johnson current noise and magnetization noise in ferromagnetic shields in terms of their
conductivity and complex magnetic permeability.

Many sensitive magnetic measurements depend on
high performance magnetic shields typically made from
high magnetic permeability metals.1 Several layers of
such µ-metal can attenuate external ﬁelds by many or-
ders of magnitude. The most sensitive measurements,
however, are limited at the level of 1–10 fT Hz−1/2 by
the magnetic noise generated by the innermost layer
of the magnetic shield itself.2,3 Superconducting mag-
netic shields do not generate magnetic noise,4 but ther-
mal radiation shields required for their use with room-
temperature samples typically also generate noise of 1–
3 fT Hz−1/2.

MnZn ferrites are promising materials for magnetic

∼

shielding because of their high relative permeability (µ
∼
104µ0) and much higher electrical resistivity (ρ
1 Ω m)
than µ-metal. We measured magnetic ﬁelds inside a
10 cm diameter MnZn ferrite shield using a spin-exchange
relaxation free (SERF) atomic magnetometer and found
that the magnetic noise level is up to 10 times lower
than the noise measured in Ref. 3 from a 40 cm diam-
eter µ-metal shield. In addition to electrical resistivity
other sources of dissipation can lead to magnetic noise
in accordance with ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem.
In
particular, magnetic viscosity eﬀects result in an imag-
inary component of magnetic permeability at low fre-
quency and generate magnetization noise with a 1/f
power spectrum.5 The measured low frequency magnetic
noise inside the ferrite is in good agreement with a predic-
tion for this magnetization noise based on independently
measured complex permeability of the ferrite material.
To aid with the design of low noise magnetic shields we
also derive simple analytic relationships for Johnson cur-
rent noise and magnetization noise inside inﬁnitely long
cylindrical magnetic shields.

Shield performance was measured using a SERF mag-
netometer, diagrammed in Fig. 1, that is similar to the
design in Ref. 3. A
2 cm diameter spherical glass cell
contains potassium in natural abundance, 3 atm of 4He
50 torr N2 gas to quench
to reduce wall relaxation, and
the K excited state. The cell was heated by a resistive
twisted-pair wire heater and the K density was measured
1013 cm−3, corresponding to a temperature of
to be 3

FIG. 1: (Color online) Schematic of the experimental appara-
tus. Three layers of µ-metal and one layer of ferrite form a set
of cylindrical shields, symmetric about the axis of the pump
laser. The shielding factor of the shields was measured using a
SERF magnetometer, formed in the K cell at the intersection
of the pump and probe beams.

temperature of
150 C. The space around the oven is
∼
evacuated to
10 millitorr for thermal insulation and
laser light travels through the shields in evacuated tubes
to reduce optical noise due to convection. Circularly po-
larized light tuned to the D1 resonance of potassium at
770 nm polarizes the potassium atoms. Atomic spin pre-
cession in a magnetic ﬁeld is detected by optical rotation
of oﬀ-resonant, linearly polarized light. The polarization
angle is precisely measured using a photoelastic modu-
lator (PEM) and a lock-in ampliﬁer.6 The optical com-
ponents are mounted on a breadboard less than 100 cm
in diameter; the compact construction is intended to de-
crease low-frequency noise due to thermal drift.

Cylindrical shields are composed of three layers of
1.6 mm thick, high permeability µ-metal surrounding a
10 mm thick, 104 mm inner-diameter ferrite shield. The
shields have 18 mm access holes along the three princi-
pal axes of the device. The ferrite shield is assembled
from three parts: an annulus and two discs as endcaps.

100 in the axial direction. Whereas the shielding factor in
the radial direction agrees with calculations based on the
µ of the ferrite, the shielding factor in the axial direction
is lower than expected, which is likely due to small gaps
between the ferrite parts. The mating ferrite surfaces

of the shielding factor at 22 Hz is due to the cancella-
tion of the external ﬁeld leaking through the holes in the
shields with the phase-shifted ﬁeld penetrating through
the shield.1

Measurements of the ferrite shield magnetic noise per-
formed with the SERF magnetometer were limited by
optical rotation noise outside the magnetometer band-
In order to measure the magnetic
width of
noise spectrum over a larger frequency range, we tuned
the magnetometer to resonate at higher frequencies by
applying a constant Bz ﬁeld. The resonant frequency
of the atomic spins is given by f = γBz/2πq where
γ = gµB/~ is the gyromagnetic ratio for the electron and
q is the slowing-down factor due to the hyperﬁne interac-
tion and spin-exchange collisions in the SERF regime.7
The magnetometer noise spectrum was calibrated by ap-
plying known ﬁelds in 3 directions and measuring the
magnetometer response as a function of frequency. The
response curves Ry(f ) and Rx(f ) to modulated By and
Bx are shown in Fig. 2; the response to modulated Bz
0. As the ﬁgure indicates, in the

sensitive only to the ﬁeld By perpendicular to the plane
of the lasers. When the ﬁeld parallel to the pump beam

FIG. 3: (Color online) SERF magnetometer noise spectra.
The composite noise spectrum was constructed from nine res-
onant spectra whose sensitivity windows covered the entire
frequency range. Two such sample spectra are shown with
Bz = 0 nT covering the low frequency range below 5 Hz and
Bz = 18 nT covering 80 to 110 Hz range. Probe noise is
obtained with unpolarized atoms. Lines indicate the calcu-
lated ferrite noise 4.4f −1/2 fT and a baseline white noise of
0.75 fT Hz

−1/2.

Bz corresponds to a Larmor frequency greater than the
atomic relaxation rate, the magnetometer also has a sig-
niﬁcant resonant response to the ﬁeld Bx parallel to the
probe beam; the response in this regime is comparable in
magnitude to the response to By.8 Thus, the measured
noise spectrum Vm(f ) is composed of the magnetometer
response to noise in both x and y directions and can be
Rx(f )2 + Ry(f )2.
calibrated using δBm(f ) = Vm(f )/
Note that we assume the noise in both x and y directions
is the same due to the symmetry of the shield geometry
and δBm(f ) is the magnetic ﬁeld noise along a single axis
and is directly comparable to the theoretical calculations
below.

We measured noise spectra from the magnetometer at
nine resonant frequencies in order to determine the mag-
netic noise spectrum up to 200 Hz. Each successive spec-
trum traced out a smooth envelope of noise near reso-
nance and was dominated by probe noise oﬀ resonance.
The consistency of these successive spectra indicates that
the magnetometer is primarily measuring magnetic ﬁeld
noise. In contrast, the voltage spectrum of probe beam
noise, which is due to shot noise and other non-magnetic
noise, is not dependent on Bz. A composite spectrum
shown in Fig. 3 is assembled from the most responsive
frequency ranges of each of the measured resonant spec-
tra. This composite spectrum shows magnetic noise that
decreases up to 35 Hz, in good agreement with the cal-
culation of ferrite magnetization noise presented below.

Deviation from the ferrite noise at very low frequencies is
likely due to thermal and mechanical drift. Note that the
ferrite temperature rose to 50 C during operation. Above
−1/2 due
35 Hz, the magnetic noise levels oﬀ at 0.75 fT Hz
to decreasing magnetometer signal and is primarily lim-
ited by photon shot noise.

Ferrite and µ-metal, as all dissipative materials,
exhibit thermal noise according to the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem. Following the generalized Nyquist
relation,9 the magnetic ﬁeld noise spectrum at a point in-
side a dissipative (non-superconducting) magnetic shield
can be calculated from the power loss in the shield ma-
terial generated by an oscillating current ﬂowing in a
hypothetical excitation coil located at the same point.
For a ferrite shield, which has low electrical conductivity
(σ < 1 Ω−1m−1), the dissipation power P at low frequen-

This power loss represents an eﬀective resistance in
the excitation coil according to P = I 2Reﬀ /2, where I
is the amplitude of the current in the coil. The eﬀec-
tive resistance Reﬀ then gives a Johnson noise voltage
δV =
4kT Reﬀ across the coil. Since the only coupling
between the coil and the material is through magnetic
induction, this voltage noise must correspond to a mag-
netic ﬁeld noise δBmagn picked up by the coil through
Faraday’s law, δV = AωδBmagn , where A is the area of
the coil (taken as single-turn). As a result, the magnetic

The noise of our ferrite shield was determined by mea-
suring the complex permeability of the material, MN80
from Ceramic Magnetics Inc. The permeability was de-
termined by a four-point impedance measurement at 10–
100 Hz on a sixteen-turn toroidal coil wound around the
cap of the ferrite shield, a 10 mm thick circular disk with
an 18 mm diameter center hole. The measurement was
carried out at room temperature and with driving ﬁelds
in the range of µ0Hdr = 0.4–6 µT. The relative permeabil-
ity was constant over the measurement frequency range
and corresponded to µ′/µ0 = 2030 and µ′′/µ0 = 6.1 when
extrapolated to the zero driving ﬁeld limit. These values

were taken as the low-frequency permeability of the ma-
terial and used in our calculation of magnetic ﬁeld noise
at all frequencies (< 200 Hz) considered in this work.
The corresponding loss factor µ′′µ0/µ′2 = 1.48

was about three times smaller than the manufacturer-
provided value measured at 100 kHz. The ﬁeld noise at
the center of the ferrite shield was then calculated from
Eq. (2) in both axial and radial directions; Hrms was
calculated numerically using commercial ﬁnite element
analysis software (Maxwell 3D, Ansoft Corporation). At
−1/2
1 Hz, the ﬁeld noise was δBmagn = 4.4
in both directions. The spectrum of the calculated radial
noise is plotted in Fig. 3.

analytically calculated by determining H inside the shield
induced by an excitation coil. Following the method for

In comparison, a µ-metal shield generates magnetic
ﬁeld noise from both thermal magnetization noise and

ments performed at very low frequency (< 2 Hz). At very

thermal magnetization noise of δBmagn = 11f −1/2 fT for
a thin shield with t = 1 mm and r = 52 mm, compara-
ble in overall size to our ferrite shield. With increasing
frequency, the thermal magnetization noise decreases un-
til the Johnson noise currents dominate. These currents
can be calculated from the eddy current loss;13 for an
inﬁnitely long cylinder, analytical calculation shows that

where self-shielding becomes dominant, due to either the
skin depth eﬀect or inductive screening. In the case of
a high permeability metal, the self shielding is governed
by the skin depth eﬀect, and the noise rolls oﬀ as f −1/4
1/(πµσt2).14 For the geometry described above,
for f
δBeddy = 19 fT Hz−1/2 at room temperature, becoming
signiﬁcant above 0.3 Hz and rolling oﬀ by 3 dB at about
45 Hz. We have found numerically that the transverse
ﬁeld noise is similar to the longitudinal ﬁeld noise in our

geometry, allowing valid comparison between transverse
measurements and these analytical expressions.

In summary, we have demonstrated a 1 cm thick cylin-
drical ferrite magnetic shield with shielding properties
similar to a 1 mm thick µ-metal magnetic shield of the
same overall size. The ferrite shield has less than half
the thermal magnetization noise in the frequency range
below 0.3 Hz and 25 times lower noise at 30 Hz due to the
absence of Johnson noise currents. Using a ferrite shield,
we have been able to demonstrate a SERF magnetometer
with single-channel sensitivity of 0.75 fT Hz−1/2, limited
only by the magnetization noise of ferrite and photon
shot noise. By assembling a set of resonant sensitivity

measurements, we found that the primary noise in the
system is magnetic and in good agreement with the cal-
culated noise from the ferrite shield across a range of
frequencies from 0 to 200 Hz. Ferrite fabrication is more
economical at smaller dimensions and may be of value to
compact devices that are sensitive to magnetic ﬁelds such
as atomic clocks, atomic gyroscopes, magnetometers and
co-magnetometers.

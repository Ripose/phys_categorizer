Abstract

In this paper, we investigate the integration domain of the Hylleraas coordinates that are em-

ployed for the determination of properties of the Helium atom, the positive ions of its isoelectronic

sequence, and the negative Hydrogen ion. We derive the domain for ﬁnite space, and express it as

composed of two parts T1 and T2. In the limit of inﬁnite space, we show that the Hylleraas domain

is equivalent to T1 in the same limit. For the approximate variational wave functions employed by

Hylleraas and in the literature, the contribution of the domain T2 vanishes. The constraints on

approximate wave functions for which this latter contribution is ﬁnite is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Schr¨odinger equation [1] for the Helium atom, or the positive ions of its isoelectronic

sequence, or of the negative Hydrogen ion, is

where r1, r2 are the coordinates of the two electrons, r12 is the distance between them(see

Fig.1), Z the charge of the nucleus, and Ψ and E the eigenfunction and eigenenergy of

the system. As noted by Hylleraas [2], the Schr¨odinger equation in this instance is not a

six-dimensional but rather a three-dimensional eigenvalue problem. The natural coordinates

of the system are r1, r2, and r12 forming the triangle (r1, r2, r12). The other three angle

variables which determine the orientation of the triangle in space, because of the symme-

try of the system, are arbitrary and can be integrated over. Equivalently, the system is

uniquely described by the coordinates r1, r2, and θ12, the angle between the vectors r1 and r2.

As is well known, there is no closed-form analytical solution to the two-electron eigenvalue

problem. Hence, the energy is most accurately obtained by variational minimization of the

energy functional E[Ψ] deﬁned as

E[ψ] = R

ψ ˆHψdτ

R
with respect to the parameters in the wave function. In performing such variational calcu-

lations, Hylleraas further introduced the ‘elliptical’ coordinates

s = r1 + r2, t = r1 − r2, u = r12.

Then assuming approximate wave functions dependent on these coordinates, he applied the

variational principle to obtain the energy. There has been similar work employing these

(s, t, u) coordinates over the past decades [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

In this paper, we investigate the domain of integration of the elliptical coordinates

(s, t, u) for both ﬁnite and inﬁnite space. We show and prove in section II that the

2

nucleus at the origin.

integration domain may be written as a sum of two contributions T1 and T2.

In section

III, we show for the case of inﬁnite space that the domain of integration employed by

Hylleraas and others corresponds to that of T1. We further show that for the approximate

wave functions employed by these authors, the contribution of T2 vanishes. Thus,

if

the exact wave function (were it known), or any approximate wave function, decays

more slowly than those employed in the literature, then the contribution of T2 becomes

signiﬁcant and must be determined. We summarize our results and conclusions in section IV.

II. DOMAIN OF INTEGRATION OF (s, t, u) COORDINATES

Let us ﬁrst focus on the volume element dτ of Eq.(3). Employing the symmetry of the

system, dτ can be rewritten as

dτ = dr1dr2 = J(r1, r2, θ12)dr1dr2dθ12,

(5)

(6)

(7)

(9)

where J(r1, r2, θ12) is the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation. By ﬁxing r1 ﬁrst, carry

out the integral of r2 with respect to r1 to arrive at (see Fig.1)

dτ =

dr1r2

2dr2 sinθ12dθ12dϕ12 = 2π

dr1r2

Next, by integrating over r1, we note there is no dependence on the Euler angles, so that

Eq.(6) reduces to

dτ = 8π2

We now introduce the new variable u, the distance between r1 and r2:

u2 = r2

1 + r2

2 − 2r1r2 cosθ12.

During the previous integration steps, if r1 and r2 are ﬁxed ﬁrst, then

u du = r1r2 sinθ12dθ12,

so that (for the case of inﬁnite volume)

Eq.(8) appeares in the work of Hylleraas[2].

Let us next conﬁne the two electrons in some ﬁnite volume of space such that 0 ≤ r1 ≤ R

and 0 ≤ r2 ≤ R. The reason we choose the same R is because of the symmetry between the

two electrons. The limit R −→ ∞ then leads to the inﬁnite space integral. For the elliptical

coordinates s and t of Eq.(4), it is easy to show that

dr1dr2 =

dsdt, r1r2 =

(s2 − t2).

Therefore, for any integrand f , which is a function of (s, t, u), we have from Eqs.(10) and

(11) that the integral in terms of the new coordinates (s, t, u) is

FIG. 3: The domain S′ of integration of the Hylleraas coordinates s and t.

Here S′ denotes the integration domain in the new coordinates (s, t).

This do-

main has changed from S :

[0 ≤ r1 ≤ R, 0 ≤ r2 ≤ R] as shown in Fig.2 to

S′ : [0 ≤ s ≤ 2R; −R ≤ t ≤ R] shown in Fig.3.

The function f (s, t, u) could be ψ ˆHψ or ψ2. As stated by Bethe[9]: “ The exact symmetry

5

requirement [of the wave function] then takes the simple form that ψ be an even function of

t for parahelium, an odd function of t for ortho-helium. Since the Hamiltonian is an even

function of t and since the integrals in Eq.(3) contain two factors, the contribution to the

integral from −t is identical with that from +t. We therefore restrict ourselves to positive

values of t in the integrals and multiply the volume element by a factor of 2”. With that in

mind, Eq. (12) can be rewritten as

f dτ = 2π2

Now we can see from equation (13) that the integration domain has two components. For

convenience, let us denote them as T1 and T2 where

The correctness of the integration domain can be readily conﬁrmed by simply choosing

f (s, t, u) = 1. The result should be the square of the volume of a sphere with radius R.

Indeed, one easier way to determine this is by employing Eq.(7)

On the other hand, we can carry out the integral through the new domain derived in Eq.(13).

(20)

The agreement of the two ways to obtain the volume proves that the new integration

domain as deﬁned by Eq.(13) is correct.

III. COMPARISON WITH THE HYLLERAAS DOMAIN OF INTEGRATION

In this section, we compare our new integration domain with that of Hylleraas. In his

original paper[2], Hylleraas used the following domain for when the space is inﬁnite:

(21)

For a comparison with the domain of integration derived, we take the R −→ ∞ limit of

Eq.(13). The two results ought to be equivalent. However, we ﬁnd that it is only limR−→∞T1

(see Eq.(14)) that is equivalent to Eq.(21) of Hylleraas. For R −→ ∞

(22)

As shown by Fig.4, in Eq.(21), for each u with 0 ≤ u ≤ s, we have 0 ≤ t ≤ u , the

area swept is the upper shaded triangle. On the other hand, in Eq.(22), for each t with

0 ≤ t ≤ s, we have t ≤ u ≤ s , so that the area is the same as in Eq.(21). Therefore, for

any integrand, the integrals of Eq.(21) and (22) are the same.

Let us now turn to Eq.(15) and examine T2 in the same limit. As we have shown earlier,

in ﬁnite space, the contribution of T2 plays an important role. When R −→ ∞, we have

It is only when the function h(R, s) decays in a manner such that limR−→∞T2 vanishes

that the Hylleraas domain of integration is the same as that of T1. Thus, for example, if

one assumes as in prior literature that h(R, s) does not decay slower that an exponential

we have T2|R−→∞ = 0. However, if the dependence on the coordinate s contains negative

power terms of s or is multiplied by some power of lns, the contribution of T2 must be

rigorously determined.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have derived the integration domain of the Hylleraas (s, t, u) coordinates

for both ﬁnite and inﬁnite space. This domain is composed of two parts T1 and T2. We ﬁnd

that in the inﬁnite space case, the domain of integration employed by Hylleraas is the same

as that of T1. Thus, it is only when the contribution of the domain of T2 vanishes that ours

and the Hylleraas domain are equivalent. In the literature, the integrands for the energy and
l,m,n hl(s)tmun; hl(s) = sl or (lns)l

normalization employed are usually of the form e−αs

P

[7, 10], etc., for which the contribution of T2 vanishes. Hence, the domain of integration

employed in these works is appropriate. However, if wave functions and integrands with a

slower decay are employed, then the contribution of the domain of T2 must be included.

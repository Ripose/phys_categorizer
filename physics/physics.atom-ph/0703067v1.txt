We report for the ﬁrst time, laser spectroscopy of the 1S0 → 3P0 clock transition in 27Al+. A
single aluminum ion and a single beryllium ion are simultaneously conﬁned in a linear Paul trap,
coupled by their mutual Coulomb repulsion. This coupling allows the beryllium ion to sympathet-
ically cool the aluminum ion, and also enables transfer of the aluminum’s electronic state to the
beryllium’s hyperﬁne state, which can be measured with high ﬁdelity. These techniques are applied
to a measurement of the clock transition frequency, ν = 1 121 015 393 207 851(8) Hz. They are also
used to measure the lifetime of the metastable clock state, τ = 20.6 ± 1.4 s, the ground state 1S0
g-factor, gS = −0.00079248(14), and the excited state 3P0 g-factor, gP = −0.00197686(21), in units
of the Bohr magneton.

PACS numbers:

The 1S0 → 3P0 transition in Al+ has long been recog-
nized as a good clock transition [1, 2], due to its narrow
natural linewidth (8 mHz), and its insensitivity to mag-
netic ﬁelds and electric ﬁeld gradients (J = 0), which are
common in ion traps. More recently, this transition was
also found to have a small room-temperature blackbody
radiation shift [3]. However, diﬃculties with direct laser
cooling and state detection have so far prevented its use.
Some of the basic ingredients for ion-trap based quan-
tum computing [4] can be used to overcome these diﬃ-
culties with the method of quantum logic spectroscopy
[5], where an auxiliary ion takes over the requirements of
laser cooling and state detection. Quantum logic spec-
troscopy was ﬁrst demonstrated experimentally on the
1S0 → 3P1 transition in 27Al+ [6]. Here we use this tech-
nique for spectroscopy of the narrow 1S0 → 3P0 clock
transition, allowing, for the ﬁrst time, high precision op-
tical spectroscopy of an atomic species that can not be
directly laser cooled.

[7, 8], optical atomic frequency standards can be com-
pared with an uncertainty limited only by quantum
projection noise [9] and the systematic errors of the
atomic standards. This stability and accuracy can be
transferred to any part of the optical spectrum, as well
as the RF domain. The 1S0 → 3P0 clock transition in
27Al+, due to its insensitivity to external ﬁelds,
is a
viable candidate to reach 10−18 inaccuracy. Here we
demonstrate high precision spectroscopy of the clock
transition in a single 27Al+ ion, which is the fundamental
step necessary to realize such a frequency standard.

We use 27Al+, because this is the only naturally oc-
curring isotope of aluminum. With nuclear spin I = 5
2 ,
27Al+ has no ﬁrst-order magnetic-ﬁeld-independent tran-
sition, but this is not a signiﬁcant drawback. Instead, we
create a “virtual” (1S0, mF = 0) → (3P0, mF ′ = 0) ﬁeld-

2 ) and (mF = 5

2 ) →(mF ′ = − 5

independent transition, by regularly alternating between
2 ) →(mF ′ = 5
(mF = − 5
2 )
transitions [10]. This way, the average Zeeman state of
both the ground and excited clock state is strictly zero. A
beneﬁt of this approach is that the outer mF = ± 5
2 states
can be prepared more easily than the inner mF states, by
optical pumping through the (3P1, F= 7
2 ) state (300 µs
lifetime). In addition, the ion’s Zeeman splitting serves
as a real-time magnetometer to determine the quadratic
Zeeman shift of the clock transition.

In the experiment, single 9Be+, and 27Al+ ions are
loaded into a linear Paul trap [11], by electron impact
ionization. Under ultra-high vacuum conditions, one ion
pair usually lasts for several hours, before an adverse
chemical reaction with background gas removes one of
the ions from the trap. The pair forms a two-ion “crystal”
along the trap axis, whose in-phase-motion axial normal
mode frequency is 2.62 MHz. The radial modes (per-
pendicular to the trap axis), where the 27Al+ ion’s am-
plitude is largest, have frequencies of 3.8 MHz and 4.9
MHz. Laser beams of 313 nm wavelength drive Doppler
cooling, stimulated Raman, and repumping transitions
on 9Be+ [12]. Another laser produces 266.9 nm radia-
tion to drive the (1S0, F = 5
2 ) transition
in 27Al+, and a frequency-quadrupled ﬁber laser at 267.4
nm (the clock laser), with approximately 3 Hz linewidth,
excites the 1S0 → 3P0 transition.

2 ) → (3P1, F = 7

The 1S0 → 3P0 transition is probed with single interro-
gation pulses from the clock laser. Since the upper state
is metastable, the method of electron-shelving detection
[1] is applied. This way the 1S0 → 3P1 transition is mod-
ulated by the clock states, and the modulation condition
(allowed or forbidden) is detected with quantum logic.

Quantum logic spectroscopy of the 1S0 → 3P1 transi-
tion has been described previously [6], and is used sim-
ilarly here. A quantum logic pulse sequence (described
below) maps the 27Al+ 1S0 state to the dark 9Be+ F

= 1 hyperﬁne ground state via a 1S0 → 3P1 motional-
sideband excitation. This sequence is blocked when the
27Al+ ion is in the 3P0 state, leaving 9Be+ in the bright
F = 2 hyperﬁne ground state, into which it had previ-
ously been optically pumped. An average of seven 9Be+
313 nm ﬂuorescence photons are counted if the 27Al+ ion
is in the 3P0 state (Figure 1b), and only one photon is
counted if the 27Al+ ion is in the 1S0 state (Figure 1a).
This provides for clock-state discrimination with 80 %
ﬁdelity in a single detection experiment, limited by inac-
curacies in the various π-pulses, and imperfect ground-
state cooling. However, the single-experiment detection
ﬁdelity does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the ﬁnal detection ﬁ-
delity for the clock state. We simply repeat the readout
sequence several times, and the combined information al-
lows nearly unit detection ﬁdelity [13].

A typical (1S0, mF = 5

inter-
rogation consists of the following steps, with speciﬁed
durations. For mF = mF ′ = − 5
2 , the polarizations and
angular momentum states of Al+ are reversed.

2 ) → (3P0, mF ′ = 5
2 )

1. Sympathetic Doppler cooling via 9Be+ (600 µs)
cools all six normal modes of the two-ion crystal to
the Doppler limit (mean motional quantum number
¯n ≈ 3).

2. Clock interrogation (1 to 100 ms pulse duration, ad-
justed for desired resolution) drives the 1S0 → 3P0
transition. Beryllium Doppler cooling light is ap-
plied simultaneously to counteract anomalous heat-
ing of the ions [14, 15].

Subsequently, state detection (1S0 or 3P0 ) is performed
by repeating the following sequence about 10 times.

1. Optical pumping π-pulse 27Al+ (1S0, F = 5

2 , mF =
2 ) → (3P1, F = 7
2 , mF ′ = 5
2 ) (4 µs) transfers
residual inner Zeeman state population to the outer
mF = 5
2 state. The inner states may be populated
due to spontaneous decay from the 3P0
state, or
due to imperfect polarization and oﬀ-resonant tran-
sitions during other 1S0 → 3P1 pulses. Most of the
time this pulse has no eﬀect, because 27Al+ is al-
ready in the (1S0, mF = 5

2 ) state.

2. Sympathetic Doppler cooling (600 µs).

repetitions (10 to 20 ms total). The ﬁtted curve is a Fourier-
limited Rabi lineshape, scaled to the observed 90 % contrast.

2 ) → (3P0, mF ′ = 5

and it is dark in the F = 1 state (see Fig. 1a and
1b).

Because the duration of each state detection repetition
is about 2 ms, excitations into the 3P1
state (300 µs
lifetime) usually decay back to the 1S0 state, allowing
re-excitation, while 3P0 excitations (20.6 s lifetime) are
unlikely to change during the detection sequence.

For every clock interrogation pulse, the sequence of
photon counts in step 6 is recorded by a computer, which
performs a maximum-likelihood analysis to determine
whether the Al+ ion was in the 1S0 or 3P0
state [13].
Transitions between the two states are detected, and mul-
tiple repetitions of the same experiment yield the transi-

be in the 1S0 or 3P0
state at the beginning of each
experiment, depending on the outcome of the previous
experiment [17]. The ﬁnal signal is the computer’s deter-

mination of whether or not the ion has made a transition.
Figures 1c and 1d show Rabi ﬂopping, and a scan of the
clock laser frequency across the 1S0 → 3P0 resonance,
with this method.

When performing an absolute frequency measurement
of the 1S0 → 3P0 transition, the linear Zeeman splitting
of several 104 Hz/mT (see below) in both the ground and
excited clock states must be accounted for. To achieve
ﬁrst-order ﬁeld insensitivity, we create a virtual mF = 0
transition by alternating between states of opposite angu-
lar momentum, and tracking separately the mean and dif-
ference frequencies of the two transitions [10]. The mean
frequency has no linear dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld,
although a quadratic Zeeman shift of -70 Hz/mT2 re-
mains [18]. The diﬀerence frequency is directly propor-
tional to the magnetic ﬁeld, providing a real-time ﬁeld
measurement. In this way, the linear Zeeman eﬀect does
not shift the clock’s center frequency, while the quadratic
Zeeman shift can be determined from the linear splitting
and accounted for with submillihertz inaccuracy.

To lock the laser frequency to the atomic reference, the
laser’s frequency oﬀset from the atomic resonance is reg-
ularly measured and corrected. Frequency corrections
are obtained by alternating between the left and right
“half-power” points of the ion’s resonance and applying
frequency feedback to keep the transition probabilities
equal.
In order to switch between angular momentum
states, a computer-controlled waveplate selects purely σ+
or σ−-polarized 1S0 → 3P1 light that optically pumps
27Al+ to the mF = ± 5
2 ground states. At the operating
ﬁeld of approximately 0.1 mT, and typical Fourier lim-
ited linewidths of 20 Hz or less, the linear Zeeman struc-
ture of both clock states is well resolved. A synthesizer
driven acousto-optic frequency shifter changes the probe
frequency by ∆f ≈ −4 kHz to drive the (1S0, mF = 5
2 )
2 ) transition, and by −∆f to drive the
→ (3P0, mF ′ = 5
opposite Zeeman states. When locking the clock laser to
the atomic transition, the clock ground state is switched
between the mF = ± 5
2 states every three seconds. This
way, magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations (typically below 100 nT
in several minutes) contribute only short-term instability
in the clock frequency, rather than long-term inaccuracy.
We have locked the clock laser to the virtual mF =0
clock transition as described above and used the fourth
subharmonic at 1070 nm to reference one tooth of
an octave-spanning Titanium:Sapphire femtosecond laser
frequency comb (femtosecond-comb) [19]. The oﬀset fre-
quency of the femtosecond-comb is locked by use of an
f-2f interferometer, and the repetition rate is measured
by a hydrogen maser referenced to the NIST-F1 primary
cesium standard [20]. A 2600 second long measurement
of the 27Al+ clock transition frequency yields ν = 1 121
015 393 207 851(8) Hz, where the uncertainty is dom-
inated by short-term frequency ﬂuctuations in the hy-
drogen maser. Systematic uncertainties in Al+ are not
expected to be signiﬁcant at this level, where the largest

terms are second-order Doppler shifts of approximately
0.03 Hz.

We have also measured the Land´e g-factors of the 1S0
and 3P0 states. Interrogation pulses (π-polarized) yield
the g-factor diﬀerence gP − gS [21], where gP and gS
are the g-factors of the 3P0 and 1S0 states, respectively.
In addition we use σ+/−-polarized interrogation pulses
to measure another, linearly independent combination of
gP and gS, providing an accurate measurement of both
g-factors, which is unaﬀected by the chemical shifts that
currently limit the accuracy of nuclear magnetic reso-
nance (NMR) based measurements of gS [22]. An ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld B splits the mF =± 5
2 transition fre-
quencies by ∆ν = 5B(gP − gS)µB, where µB is the Bohr
magneton. The frequency splitting ∆ν is tracked and
recorded automatically in the clock laser lock described
above. In order to measure the magnetic ﬁeld, we use the
simultaneously trapped Be+ ion. Be+ has well known
ground-state Zeeman splitting [23], allowing for accurate
calibration of the external magnetic ﬁeld. In between alu-
minum clock interrogations, a 1.25 GHz magnetic ﬁeld is
applied to the beryllium ion with a loop antenna. Com-
puter control software adjusts the radiation frequency to
drive and track the magnetic-ﬁeld-sensitive (2S1/2, F = 2,
mF = −2) → (2S1/2, F = 1, mF = −1) transition, estab-
lishing a record of the magnetic ﬁeld. We ﬁnd the Zeeman
splitting of 27Al+ to be ∆ν/B = -82884(5) Hz/mT , or
gP −gS = -0.00118437(8) (see Figure 2a). A recent multi-
conﬁguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculation [18] yields a
similar theoretical value of gP − gS = -0.00118(6).

In order to determine separate values gP , and gS, we
repeated the above experiment with σ+/−-polarized clock

sitions are probed, and their magnetic-ﬁeld-induced split-

ting ∆ν′ is measured. From ∆ν′/B = (3gP − 5gS)µB =
-27547(5) Hz/mT we ﬁnd gP = −0.00197686(21) and
gS = −0.00079248(14). The uncertainties of these values
are dominated by inaccuracies in the 9Be+-based mag-
netic ﬁeld calibration. This was caused by a perturba-
tion of the current supply for the DC magnetic ﬁeld from
the 1.25 GHz RF pulse itself. We estimate that this per-
turbation is 21 ± 200 nT in both the π and σ+/− mea-
surements, and derive the stated uncertainties from the
measurements at 3 mT, where the magnetic ﬁeld uncer-
tainty has the smallest eﬀect on our results.

Since gS depends solely on the ion’s shielded nuclear
magnetic moment, this measurement may be compared
with the value recorded in nuclear data tables, which
stems from NMR experiments. An estimated shield-
ing factor of σ = 7.87(39) × 10−4 [18] for 27Al+, leads
to a bare moment of µN = 3.64067(28) nuclear mag-
netons. This diﬀers from the published value of µN =
3.64150687(65) [24] by 0.00084(28). However, the liquid-
state NMR result does not account for the chemical shift
of the nuclear magnetic moment due to the aqueous so-
lution, which generally has a magnitude of 10−4 − 10−3
nuclear magnetons [22].

Hyperﬁne-induced spontaneous decay rates of 3P0
states for the Mg-isoelectronic sequence have been calcu-
lated [25]. More recently, the lifetime was calculated [18]
as 22.7±4 s. Here we measured the lifetime by repeatedly
exciting the 3P0 state and waiting for spontaneous decay
into the ground state [26]. The aluminum internal state
was monitored by continuously applying the previously
described clock state readout sequence. Once decay has
been detected, the ion is re-excited. A total of 215 spon-
taneous emission events were observed this way, with a
mean lifetime τ = 20.6 ± 1.4 s. The reported uncertainty
is statistical, and systematic biases are estimated to be
less than 0.25 s. Figure 2(b) shows the distribution of
decay times.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated high resolution
spectroscopy of the 1S0 → 3P0 clock transition in 27Al+
using quantum logic. This technique was used to measure
the clock transition frequency with a fractional uncer-
tainty of 7 × 10−15. We have also calibrated the g-factors
of the ground and excited states and measured the ex-
cited state lifetime. These are the basic steps necessary
to implement an accurate frequency standard based on
27Al+.

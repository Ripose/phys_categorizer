ATOMS IN STATIC FIELDS: CHAOS OR DIFFRACTION ?

A brief review of the manifestations of classical chaos observed in atomic systems
is presented. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of atomic spectra by pe-
riodic orbit-type theories. For diamagnetic non-hydrogenic Rydberg atoms, the
dynamical explanation for observed spectral features has been disputed. By build-
ing on our previous work on the photoabsorption spectrum, we show how, by the
addition of diﬀractive terms, the spectral ﬂuctuations in the energy level spec-
trum of general Rydberg atoms can be obtained with remarkable precision from
the Gutzwiller trace formula. This provides further evidence that non-hydrogenic
systems are most naturally described in terms of diﬀraction rather than classical
chaos.

1 Atoms as Laboratories of Quantum Chaos

Atomic physics has provided some of the most important examples of real,
experimentally observable, quantum systems for which the underlying classical
motion is chaotic. In broad terms, the study of chaos in atoms comprises two
major strands. One is the study of time-dependent periodically driven systems
where the phenomenon of dynamical localization provides a mechanism for the
quantum suppression of chaotic diﬀusion. This is exempliﬁed by the behaviour
of hydrogen in a microwave ﬁeld 1 and, more recently, atoms in traps.2 The
other strand is the study of time independent systems. Here, highly excited
atoms in static external ﬁelds have received particular attention. Although
chaos in the sense of exponential sensitivity to perturbations is not present,
atomic spectra exhibit the characteristic ‘footprints’ of classical chaos, such as
eigenvalue statistics similar to those of random matrices, spectral modulations
and ‘scarring’ of wavefunctions by unstable periodic orbits.

The classic 1969 Garton-Tomkins spectrum of barium in a magnetic ﬁeld 3
revealed the ﬁrst ‘footprints’ of classical orbits in the quantum spectrum of
a ‘real’ system. Oscillations observed in the m = 1 spectrum near the ion-
ization limit at energy spacing
1.5¯hω were, much later, associated with

sical Poincar´e surfaces-of-section for diamagnetic hydrogen in three diﬀerent
regimes of energy. The Wigner functions show three diﬀerent stages of the
Garton-Tomkins orbit: (a) scar, (b) bifurcation and (c) torus quantization.
The surfaces-of-section show the gradual transition from regularity to chaos as

hydrogen at scaled energies (a) ε = −0.1, (b) ε = −0.316 and (c) ε = −0.5 showing the
gradual transition to chaos as ε increases.

Such is the experimental resolution now obtainable (being typically of
the order of 50MHz) that atoms still provide one of the best ‘laboratories’ for
investigating and testing theories of ‘quantum chaology’, although there is also
now great interest in chaos in mesoscopic devices.

For an atom in a strong external ﬁeld the typical spectrum, involving
highly excited states in the classically chaotic regime, looks extremely irregu-
lar. Eigenstates generally defy any form of classiﬁcation in terms of quantum
numbers. However, in the semiclassical limit (¯h
0) periodic orbit theory, in
the guise of the Gutzwiller Trace Formula (GTF),4 exposes the beautiful con-
nection between modulations in the quantum spectrum and classical orbits.
Because of a useful scaling property, Fourier transforms of calculated atomic
spectra can be related directly to classical stabilities. Hence the GTF has pro-

vided atomic physicists with an extremely powerful framework for the analysis
of quantum spectra in the classically chaotic limit.

However it is not widely appreciated that there exist two separate semi-
classical theories for the analysis of atomic spectra. The GTF relates classical
periodic orbits to oscillations in the energy level spectrum in the semiclassi-
cal regime. Closed orbit theory,5,6 on the other hand, is the appropriate tool
for the investigation of experimental photoabsorption spectra (which involve a
quantum spectrum weighted by the appropriate absorption probability).

There are important diﬀerences between the two theories which are illus-
trated qualitatively in Fig. 2. These become especially signiﬁcant when we seek
to understand the diﬀerences in behaviour between hydrogen and other atoms.
These diﬀerences in behaviour have been given diﬀerent dynamical interpre-
tations by diﬀerent authors. We review ﬁrst the main arguments concerning
non-hydrogenic spectra, before contrasting closed orbit theory with periodic
orbit theory.

2 Chaos Versus Diﬀraction in Non-Hydrogenic Atoms

It is now 10 years since it was ﬁrst shown that the GTF provides a quanti-
tative description of highly excited hydrogen atoms in strong external ﬁelds.7
However, comparisons between accurate quantal spectra reveal spectral ampli-
tudes for non-hydrogenic atoms that diﬀer substantially from those of hydrogen
together with additional modulations that cannot be associated with any hy-
drogenic orbits.8,9 Hence, it has been a long-standing problem to apply the
GTF to other species of singly excited (Rydberg) atoms.

Theoretical calculations 9 found the diﬀerences between hydrogen and
other diamagnetic atoms to be most marked in the low energy regime where
hydrogen is regular. Here, non-hydrogenic atoms show many ‘footprints’ of
chaos. For example, spectral statistics lie close to the Wigner (chaotic) limit,a
suggesting underlying chaotic classical motion. However, quantum phase-space
distributions (Wigner functions) do not have the more ‘ergodic’ appearance of
those of hydrogen in the classically chaotic regime. Instead, torus-like struc-
tures are found but with each eigenstate now linked to several ‘tori’ rather
than just one as in the hydrogenic case; clearly this is not the signature of
underlying classical chaos.

In 1994, the additional spectral modulations (‘core-scattered’ peaks) seen
for non-hydrogenic atoms were in fact observed experimentally by three sepa-
rate groups 11,12,13 and identiﬁed 12 as arising from combinations of hydrogenic
orbits.

Some progress towards the goal of adapting the GTF to describe all atoms
was made in 1995 when we successfully adapted the related closed orbit theory
of Delos and co-workers,5,6 which describes the experimentally measured pho-
toabsorption spectrum, to general non-hydrogenic atoms.14,15 However, this
work gave only limited insight and little qualitative explanation of the role
played by the non-hydrogenic core in the actual energy level spectrum.

Classical calculations using a model potential to describe the eﬀect of the
ionic core 11,16,17 suggest one possible explanation, namely that the presence
of the core drastically destabilizes the classical motion. This gives rise not
only to a reduction in amplitude of the oscillations associated with classical
hydrogenic orbits but also to a multitude of new orbits not found in the hy-
drogenic problem. Although this approach provides physical insight into the
eﬀect of the ionic core, quantitative agreement is generally poor, even failing to
reproduce the quantum results for smaller atoms such as helium.18 Indeed, any
sort of classical description of the core-scattering process may be questionable
for atoms such as helium or lithium, where only one or two partial waves are

aThis has been recently veriﬁed by experiment.10

inﬂuenced by the core.

Our 1995 work suggested an alternative explanation of these phenomena.
In non-hydrogenic atoms both the size of the core and the characteristic de
Broglie wavelength are of the order of 1 au. Thus it is more natural to describe
core eﬀects in terms of a diﬀractive process rather than classical paths and
their stability parameters. (Recall that diﬀraction occurs when an obstacle is
encountered whose size is smaller than the wavelength of the incident wave.)
There is now new evidence that this is indeed the case. Now,19 we have
shown that spectral ﬂuctuations of general Rydberg atoms are given with re-
markable precision (to within 1%) on including diﬀractive corrections to the
GTF. Several previously unknown features in the non-hydrogenic energy level
spectra were found. There are additional modulations that are neither peri-
odic orbits nor combinations of periodic orbits. Also, while ‘core-shadowing’
generally decreases the amplitude of oscillations associated with primitive pe-
riodic orbits it can also lead to increases. In addition, the spectral statistics
of diamagnetic non-hydrogenic atoms, previously thought to lie at the Wigner
limit, have been found 20 to belong to an entirely new generic distribution
(‘Half-Poisson’) usually associated with diﬀractive systems.

3 Closed Orbit Theory Versus Periodic Orbit Theory

3.1 Closed Orbit Theory

Closed orbit theory has been presented elsewhere in great detail 5,6 so we
give only an outline. Brieﬂy, when an atom absorbs a photon, the electron
propagates outwards in a near zero-energy Coulomb wave. At suﬃciently large
distances from the nucleus the wave propagates semiclassically along classical
trajectories. Eventually, the trajectories and their associated waves are turned
back by the action of the external ﬁeld. Some of the trajectories return to the
vicinity of the nucleus and the waves associated with them interfere with the
outgoing waves generating oscillations in the absorption spectrum. The result
is a formula for the average oscillator-strength density that can be written as
a combination of a smooth background plus an oscillatory term,

which arises from the interference of semiclassical waves associated with closed
orbits of an electron of energy E. Each diﬀerent orbit is indexed by k and
the repetitions of each orbit are labelled by n. The ‘recurrence amplitude’,
Cn
, contains information about the stability of the orbit via
the m12 element of the stability matrix, M ; this is obtained by studying the

Whereas closed orbit theory describes the photoabsorption spectrum in
terms of the properties of classical orbits that close at the nucleus, the Gutzwiller
Trace Formula 4 relates periodicities in the quantum density of states, ρ(E) =
(1/π)Im Tr G(E), to isolated periodic orbits. In the semiclassical limit (¯h

Although Eqs (1) and (2) show that the periodicity of the spectral mod-
ulations is the same for both theories there are important diﬀerences. Firstly,
the sum in Eq. (1) only includes contributions from orbits which deliver am-
plitude back to the vicinity of the well-localized initial state: only orbits that
return to the nucleus contribute. Note that these orbits need not be periodic.
For the GTF, all periodic orbits of the classical system contribute to the sum
in Eq. (2). Secondly, the amplitudes of the contributions are diﬀerent. Both
formulae contain information about the stability of the orbit via the stability
matrix, M . However, for closed orbit theory, the recurrence amplitude is re-
lated to m12— an oﬀ-diagonal element of M —while in the GTF, the amplitude
of the modulation due to a given orbit is proportional to (2

3.2 Gutzwiller Trace Formula with Diﬀraction

The periodic orbit theory of diﬀraction was developed recently for Hamiltoni-
ans with discontinuities.21,22 For such systems, periodic orbits are decomposed
into two types: those that do not intersect the discontinuity (geometric orbits)
and those that do (diﬀractive orbits). The density of states is then obtained
as a sum:

where Tp is the total sum of periods taken over the paths between the vertices
and d(n) is the diﬀraction constant which depends on the type of diﬀraction.
Equation (4) encapsulates the important result that the trace integral taken
between the nth and n + 1th diﬀractive points is proportional to the Green’s
function between those points.

3.3 Application to Non-Hydrogenic Atoms

We now wish to apply the diﬀractive periodic orbit theory in an atomic context
by treating the non-hydrogenic core as a diﬀractive source. The crucial step is
to obtain an expression for the diﬀractive constant d(θi, θf ).

Consider a wave incident on the atomic core at an angle θf to the z-axis.
On reaching the core, this wave produces a scattered wave, ψscatt, which feeds
outgoing semiclassical waves along periodic orbits; this scattered wave can be
decomposed into two components: 6

The Coulomb-scattered wave, ψCoul, is strongly back-focussed and equated
with the source for geometric paths. The core-scattered wave, ψcore, on the
other hand, is equated with the source of diﬀractive semiclassical waves. At
some radius r0, we express ψcore in a partial wave expansion which, for m = 0,

where δl indicates a set of l-dependent quantum defects describing the non-

exposes the diﬀractive contributions and eliminates contributions from periodic
orbits which do not pass through the core. For comparison, we also plot a
semiclassical diﬀerence spectrum obtained by summing all terms of order √¯h
and ¯h; agreement is excellent. The discrepancy in D2 is due to the eﬀects of
bifurcations that are not taken into account in the semiclassical calculation
presented here.

2.87 and S

We can see that for the non-hydrogenic case the amplitudes of the Garton-
Tomkins orbit, R1 and its harmonic R2, as well as the balloon, V 1
1 , and other
orbits are substantially reduced. There are additional small peaks which cor-
respond accurately to sums of periodic orbits. Importantly, there are strong
peaks (marked D1 and D2) which do not match any combination of orbits. At
these scaled actions (S
2.94) we ﬁnd orbits that are closed
≃
but not periodic. For hydrogen, only orbits that are periodic can contribute.
Here we see that pure diﬀractive orbits, such as D2, can contribute to the
non-hydrogenic spectrum at O(√¯h) so are substantially stronger than com-
binations of orbits. The peak at S
2.87 is due to an isolated closed orbit
and is obtained almost exactly from Eq. (8) as seen in Fig. 3(b) (note that
in Fig. 3(a) the peak associated with this orbit is masked by the peak of a
periodic orbit which does not approach the nucleus). The peak at S
2.94
consists of contributions from a pair of non-isolated orbits close to a bifurca-
tion so their contribution is over-estimated semiclassically. On examination of
the diﬀractive orbits we ﬁnd that they correspond to the ﬁrst closure of asym-
metric periodic orbits, some of which correspond to the Xn series of ‘exotic
orbits’.23 In hydrogenic eigenvalue spectra such orbits can only contribute at
their full period, whereas in the diﬀractive case they appear at closure.

4 Conclusions

We have now successfully extended our 1995 study of closed orbit theory and
for non-hydrogenic spectra to a study of periodic orbit theory per se, in the
form of the Gutzwiller trace formula. We have carried out a detailed study of
diﬀraction in atoms in the GTF for several scaled energies to study the ¯h and
δ dependence of the diﬀractive eﬀects. We ﬁnd that, away from bifurcation
eﬀects, our simple diﬀractive corrections describe the quantal spectra to within
an accuracy of about 1%. We note that a model-potential simulation with
fully chaotic dynamics gives agreement only to within a factor of about two
in general. We conclude that since the atomic core is of the order of one
atomic unit, the diﬀractive eﬀect is too weak be simulated accurately by the
cumulative eﬀect of numerous unstable orbits. However, for low energy, it is

9

most naturally and accurately described as a combination of stable motion,
coupled with a breakdown of the usual semiclassics due to diﬀraction.

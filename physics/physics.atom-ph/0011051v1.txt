Abstract

Origin of recently discovered reversed (opposite sign) dark resonances was

explained theoretically and veriﬁed experimentally. It is shown that the reason

for these resonances is a speciﬁc optical pumping of ground state level in a

transition when ground state angular momentum is smaller than the excited

state momentum.

I. INTRODUCTION

Coherent population trapping was discovered in the interaction of sodium atoms with

a laser ﬁeld in 1976. [1]. Due to this eﬀect a substantial part of population, because of

destructive quantum interference between diﬀerent excitation pathways, is trapped in a

coherent superposition of ground state sublevels – dark states. With a coherent population

trapping are associated dark resonances when due to this eﬀect absorption and as a result

ﬂuorescence from atoms decreases, but intensity of the transmitted light increases when part

of the atomic population is trapped in dark states. If in addition to the optical excitation an

external magnetic ﬁeld is applied, it can destroy coherence between ground state sublevels

and return trapped population into absorbing states and, as a result, increase absorption and

ﬂuorescence, but decrease a transmitted light. A review of applications of dark resonances

was published some years ago by Arimondo [2]. Coherence in an atomic ground state

attracted substantial attention in connection with lasing without inversion [3], magnetometry

[4] and laser cooling [5]. As a result dark resonances recently are studied in detail, including

open systems [6] and systems with losses [7]. In course of these studies a new and unexpected

phenomenon was observed by authors of [8]. In this study D2 line of 85Rb atoms was excited

by a diode laser. Radiation was tuned to the absorption from optically resolved ground

state hyperﬁne level Fg = 3 originating from atomic 5S1/2 state. The ﬁnal state of the

transition was Rb 5P3/2 excited state. Hyperﬁne components of this level was not resolved

and all allowed in a dipole transition excited state hyperﬁne levels with quantum numbers

2

Fe = 2, 3, 4 were excited. In contrary to the usual dark resonance signal when in the absence

of the magnetic ﬁeld one can observe increased transmittance and decreased ﬂuorescence

intensity authors observed opposite eﬀect — decreased transmittance which increases with

magnetic ﬁeld applied and an increased ﬂuorescence intensity which decreased when ﬁeld

was applied. Authors of the paper [8] write that the physical reason of this eﬀect remains

still unclear. They suppose that one of the reasons for the peak in the ﬂuorescence could

be the non-coupled states on the Zeeman sublevels of the excited hyperﬁne levels. These

non-coupled states, as it is supposed in [8], inhibit the stimulated emission induced by the

laser ﬁeld. The decrease of stimulated emission leads to an increase of the ﬂuorescence.

In this letter we oﬀer, in our opinion, very simple and strait forward explanation of the

origin of these ”reversed” dark resonances and perform experimental and numerical studies

of them.

II. REVERSED RESONANCE

In a simple qualitative explanation traditional dark resonances can be connected with a

well known optical pumping phenomenon. Let us assume that we excite atomic transition

Fg = 2 −→ Fe = 1 with a linearly polarized light. Direction of the z axis is chosen

along the light electric ﬁeld vector E. As a result π absorption takes place and transitions

occur between ground and excited state magnetic sublevels with ∆M = Mg − Me = 0,

where Mg, Me are magnetic quantum numbers of the ground and excited states respectively,

see Fig. 1. According to this scheme absorption does not take place from ground state

magnetic sublevels with quantum number Mg = ±2, because for these states there are no

corresponding excited state magnetic sublevel with the same magnetic quantum number

value.

In the spontaneous decay dipole transitions from optically populated excited state mag-

netic sublevels Me = ±1 to the nonabsorptive ground state sublevels Mg = ±2 are allowed.

As a result, if relaxation in the ground state is slow, in a steady state conditions substantial

3

part of the population will be optically pumped to the ground state sublevels with quan-

tum numbers Mg = ±2 and will be trapped there. As a result traditional decrease of the

absorption and ﬂuorescence and increase of the transmittance will be observed, because the

population of absorbing ground sate magnetic sublevels will be reduced.

If we now apply an external magnetic ﬁeld in a direction perpendicular to the z axis, ﬁeld

will mix ground state sublevels eﬀectively and will return trapped population into the states

from which absorption takes place. As a result absorption and ﬂuorescence will increase.

This is a qualitative explanation of the usual dark resonance.

A similar reasoning can be exploited to explain the ”reversed” resonance observed in

[8] and in this paper. Let us assume that we excite with π radiation atomic transition

Fg = 1 −→ Fe = 2. In this case there are no ground state sublevels not involved in the

absorption that can trap atomic population. The actual relative transition rates proportional

to the squared respective Clebsch – Gordan coeﬃcients in this system of sublevels are shown

in Fig. 2. As one can see ground state magnetic sublevel Mg = 0 is the most absorbing - with

highest relative absorption rate. At the same time just to this sublevel intensively with high

rates decay all three excited state magnetic sublevels populated by the light. One can expect

that in a conditions of a steady state excitation, as a result of interplay of absorption and

decay rates, population of the intensively absorbing ground state magnetic sublevel Mg = 0

will be increased and, as a result, one can expect increased absorption and ﬂuorescence from

this atom and decreased transmittance of the resonant laser light.

If an external magnetic ﬁeld is applied perpendicularly to z axis it will mix ground state

magnetic sublevels and redistribute population between the ground state magnetic sublevels.

As a result population of intensively absorbing magnetic sublevel Mg = 0 will be decreased.

At the same time population of less absorbing magnetic sublevels Mg = ±1 will be increased

This means that the total absorption and ﬂuorescence will be decreased and transmittance

will be increased. This means that reversed dark resonance will be observed.

To prove this qualitative consideration let us solve balance equations for the magnetic

sublevel stationary population nMg in the scheme shown in Fig. 2.

In a steady state

conditions for the ground state magnetic sublevels we will obtain

where Γ is excited state relaxation rate, Γp absorption rate, and ng ground state magnetic

sublevel population in absence of the radiation.

In a condition when absorption is slow

Γp ≪ Γ — weak absorption, we have

n−1 =

If we now keep in mind absorption rates from diﬀerent magnetic sublevels of the ground state,

see Fig. 2, and calculate the overall absorption from such state and compare it with the

absorption from the equally populated magnetic sublevels (when magnetic ﬁeld is applied)

than we see an increase in the absorption rate by a factor 18/17 ≈ 1.059 or by approximately

5.9%.

The same calculation can be performed for the transitions Fg = 2 −→ Fe = 3 and

Fg = 3 −→ Fe = 4. For these schemes in a similar way we will obtain even larger increase

of the absorption due to this speciﬁc optical pumping. The increase will be by a factor

540/461 ≈ 1.17 and 4004/3217 ≈ 1.24 respectively. This means that the described eﬀect

increases with increase of the quantum numbers of involved levels.

Of course presented description is only qualitative, but in our opinion gives a good idea

what is happening when reversed dark resonances are observed. To have a quantitative

description of the phenomenon one must solve equations for the density matrix for an open

system with losses. We will not do this in present paper. Instead a simple analysis will be

carried out.

An analysis of the probabilities of optical transitions originating from Fg = 3 between

excited hyperﬁne levels of the Rb atom show that levels Fe = 2, 3, 4 are populated in the

ratio (5/18 ≈ 0.278) : (35/36 ≈ 0.972) : (9/4 = 2.25). It means that a hyperﬁne transition

leading to the reversed dark resonances discussed above is most strongly excited. For this

scheme let us calculate a signal shape using a full density matrix approach. We solved a

rate equations for a density matrix, see [9], Chapter 5, for Fg = 3 ←→ Fe = 4 transition.

A broad line approximation was used. It means that we assume that in a magnetic ﬁeld all

magnetic sublevels are in equally good resonance with radiation. Secondly, we assumed that

at a magnetic ﬁeld strength used in the experiment (resonance width is less than 100 mG)

hyperﬁne levels experience linear Zeeman eﬀect. No substantial hyperﬁne level mixing at

applied ﬁeld strength takes place. Direct Rb atom magnetic sublevel splitting in a magnetic

ﬁeld calculations and measurements prove that these assumption are valid, see for example

[10]. For signal simulation the following rate constants were used. Excited state relaxation

rate Γ = 3.8 × 107 s−1 [11], absorption rate Γp = 3 × 106 s−1, ground state relaxation
rate γ = 2 × 105 s−1 (mainly due to collisions with the walls of the cell and ﬂy-through

the excitation laser beam) . Lande factors gg = −0.3336, ge = −0.5013 were calculated

in a standard way from the atomic and nuclear data available in [12]. We suppose that a

magnetic ﬁeld is applied along z axis. Laser light excites Fg = 3 −→ Fe = 4 transition and

is linearly polarized along y axis. Intensity of the ﬂuorescence with the same polarization is

calculated and the intensity of the transmitted beam is also calculated as a function of the

magnetic ﬁeld. The results are presented in a Fig. 3. They demonstrate well pronounced

reverse resonances and are in a very good qualitative agreement with the measurements

obtained in [8], see Fig. 5. there. Width of these resonances can be varied by changing

ground state Lande factor value, ground state relaxation rate and absorption rate.

At week absorption Γp ≪ Γ the dark resonance width is determined by a condition when

ground state Larmor frequency is equal to the ground state relaxation rate. For Fg = 3

state of 85Rb atom at low concentration it can be as narrow as 20 − 30 mG. This is a width

that was actually observed in [8].

6

Obtained signals in some sense are the same as the ground state Hanle eﬀect measured

in atoms as well as in molecules in great extent, see. for example [9,13]. In case of molecules

also reversed structure in ground state Hanle eﬀect was observed.

In case of molecules,

when optical pumping takes place in an open cycle and a total ground state population is

substantially reduced, this structure can be attributed to a high order coherence created

between ground state magnetic sublevels [14,15]

III. EXPERIMENTAL

We performed measurements of these reversed resonances also in our laboratory. In our

experiment we use isotopically enriched rubidium (99 % of 85Rb) that is contained in a glass

cell at room temperature to keep atomic vapor concentration low and avoid reabsorption.

Transition 5s 2S1/2 to 5p 2P3/2 at 780.2 nm is excited using both temperature- and current-

stabilized single-mode diode laser (Sony SLD114VS) with beam diameter 7 mm. Absorption

signal (transmitted light) is monitored by a photodiode. As the laser is swept applying a

ramp on a drive current, two absorption peaks with half-width of about 600 MHz separated

by ∼ 3 GHz appear due to the 85Rb ground state hyperﬁne structure. The excited state

hyperﬁne structure is not resolved under Doppler proﬁle.

During the resonance measurements, the laser wavelength is stabilized on absorption

peak originating from ground sate hyperﬁne level Fg = 3.

Helmholz coils are used to sweep the magnetic ﬁeld over zero Gauss region, the Earth

magnetic ﬁeld components are compensated.

Signal detected in a transmitted light is averaged over 64 cycles and the result is presented

in a Fig. 4, data points and Lorenz ﬁtting, curve 1. On the same ﬁgure a calculated signal,

curve 2, is presented. Model for this calculation is the same as in case on Fig. 3. Amplitude

of the experimental and calculated signals are in arbitrary units and in ﬁgure are scaled

in a way to make them easy to compare. For theoretical curve the parameters are chosen

to have values that maximally reproduce our experimental conditions. The ground state

7

relaxation rate γ = vp/r0 = 0.07 µs−1 was chosen as a reciprocal time of thermal motion

of Rb atoms at room temperature with most probable velocity vp = 0.24 mm/µs through
the laser beam of radius r0 = 3.5 mm [9]. Absorption rate was chosen to be Γp = 1.5 µs−1.

Other parameters are as in Fig. 3. Agreement between calculated and measured signal is

remarkable. As far as our model does not account for transitions to other hyperﬁne levels

and so does not reproduce experiment in full, we do not attempt to ﬁt experimental points

with theoretical curve, nevertheless achieved agreement fully convinces us that the proposed

explanation of the reversed dark resonances is correct. To obtain quantitative description of

this signal in future one must take into account in the numerical model all other hyperﬁne

levels involved in the process.

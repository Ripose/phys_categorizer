We calculate the spectrum of a beam of atoms output
from a single mode atomic cavity. The output coupling uses
an internal state change to an untrapped state. We present
an analytical solution for the output energy spectrum from a
broadband coupler of this type. An example of such an output
coupler, which we discuss in detail uses a Raman transition
to produce a non-trapped state.

As a result of recent experiments in which a Bose Ein-
stein Condensate (BEC) has been produced in the lab
[1–4] there has been considerable interest in coupling the
atoms in a BEC out of a trap. This could produce a con-
tinuous, coherent, directional beam of atoms - an atom
laser beam [5–11]. While initial experiments have suc-
ceeded in coupling atoms out of a BEC by changing the
internal state of the atoms to a non-trapped state [12,13],
there is still much to be understood about the output
beam. In this paper we present an analytical solution for
the output energy spectrum of atoms in a single trapped
mode coupled to free space by a change of internal state.
Our analysis is based on the atom ﬁeld input-output the-
ory presented by Hope [14]. We discuss the dependence
of the spectrum on output coupling strength, and relate
these ﬁndings to the MIT atom laser experiment [12,13].
In a BEC a large number of bosonic atoms are cooled
into a single energy eigenstate of a trap. This is an im-
portant step towards producing a monoenergetic beam
of atoms. Nevertheless we still have the problem of how
to coherently couple the atoms out of such a trap in a
way that preserves their monoenergetic nature.

There are many ways in which atoms can be coupled
out of a trap. The simplest method is to turn oﬀ the
trap [8]. The result of rapidly turning oﬀ the trap is to
reproduce the BEC wavefunction in free space. In par-
ticular, the wavefunction momentum width is conserved.
As a result, the atoms have the corresponding range of
energies in free space and the monoenergetic nature of
the original BEC is lost. Fortunately, energy conserving
output coupling is possible. One example is quantum
mechanical tunneling of atoms through the trap walls.
This is the atomic analogue to the use of partially trans-
parent mirrors on an optical laser. Such a process has
been considered in a model of an atom laser proposed by
Wiseman [6]. It would be diﬃcult in practice, however,
to use tunneling to produce suﬃcient ﬂuxes of atoms due
to the exponential dependence of the tunneling rate on

the trap potential barrier.

Another approach to the output coupling problem
would be to change the internal state of the trapped
atoms to an untrapped state. Experimentally such a
method has been used by implementing radio-frequency
pulses to induce spin ﬂips on trapped atoms in a BEC
[12,13]. Furthermore the use of Raman transitions as
a method of output coupling has been suggested [11].
Raman transitions have a number of advantages. A Ra-
man transition can have an extremely narrow linewidth
so that lasers can be tuned so as to only couple atoms
from a particular trap mode, due to energy conserva-
tion. Moreover when Raman beams are oriented so that
they are counter propagating, they provide a momentum
kick of size 2¯hk. This could be used to provide direc-
tionality to the atomic output beam if atoms were sup-
ported against gravity, for instance in a hollow optical
ﬁber [15–17].

We model here an output coupler based on change
of state, focusing initially on the speciﬁc case of a Ra-
man output coupler which uses two lasers tuned to a
two-photon resonance to couple atoms between an initial
atomic state, and a ﬁnal atomic state. There is a third,
excited, atomic state which mediates the Raman transi-
tion. We assume that each of the lasers is far detuned
from single photon resonance. In this far detuned limit
we can adiabatically eliminate the third state to produce
an eﬀective two level Hamiltonian. In this Hamiltonian
we ignore the energies of higher atomic modes of the trap.
Initially these other modes are empty as we assume all
the atoms are condensed in the ground mode. Ignoring
these higher energy modes for later time is valid for very
narrow linewidth Raman lasers which are only on res-
onance with the ground trap mode. This ensures that
higher modes do not become populated by atoms in the
output state transferring back into the initial state at
later times.
In addition population of other modes is
suppressed by Bose enhancement of transitions into the
ground mode [11]. We also ignore the eﬀects of atom-
atom interactions. The resulting eﬀective Hamiltonian is
then of the form

Here, the single trap mode is described by the creation
operator, a† and is coupled by the Raman lasers to a
continuous spectrum of external modes described by cre-
ation operators, b†
k. ¯hω1 (¯hω2) is the energy of the trap
(output) atomic state. ¯hω0 is the ground state trap en-
ergy. m is the mass of the trapped atoms. ¯hk1L and
¯hk2L are the momenta of the two lasers inducing the
Raman transition, with frequencies ω1L and ω2L respec-
tively. Thus ¯h(k1L + k2L) is the total momentum kick re-
ceived by atoms making the Raman transition. Ω1 (Ω2) is
the Rabi frequency of the transition between the trapped
(output) state and the excited state which mediates the
Raman transition. ∆1 and ∆2 are the detunings of the
two Raman lasers from the excited state. We have as-
sumed these are large in adiabatically eliminating the up-
per level. If the lasers are tuned close to the two-photon

The form of κ′(k, t) for a general interaction describing a
change of state is κ(k, t) = ψ∗(k
k0) [14]. Here, ψ(k) is
the ground state momentum space wavefunction of the
single mode system and k0 describes a possible ﬁxed mo-
mentum kick applied to the atoms in the state change
process. In the following we discuss the Raman coupling
case, given by Eqs. (5 - 8) for deﬁniteness. The results,
however, are valid for a general output coupler in the
regime where the coupling strength, Γ, and the energies
¯h˜ω0 and ¯h˜ωk are suitably deﬁned.

inverse Laplace transforms. Using these solutions, the

We present an analytic solution for the spectrum in the
limit of broadband coupling. For simplicity, we consider
the case where the total momentum kick from the Raman

lasers is very small. That is we assume k1L ≈ −
is analogous to the MIT output coupling experiments in
which the atoms receive a negligible momentum kick in
changing state [12,13]. We also assume that the coupling
function κ(k, t) is broad. The shape of κ(k, t) is given by
the ground state momentum wavefunction of the trap,
ψ(k). We consider here a harmonic trap, with a gaussian
ground state of standard deviation σk in wavenumber

Using this approximation to calculate Mk(t) is equivalent
to discarding high (> ¯hσ2

the Laplace transform space. As we increase the width
of our coupling in momentum space, given by σk, our
solution for Mk(t) becomes valid for increasingly high
frequencies. For an inﬁnitely broad coupling our expres-
sion becomes exact, and is equivalent to the form of the

agrees with the perturbative solutions presented by Hope
[14]. For longer times, we can see that the spectrum
reaches a stable shape. For very large values of the cou-
pling strength, the long time limit becomes very broad in
k-space. As a result, the shape of the output spectrum, as
given by Eq. (9), simply reﬂects the momentum distribu-
tion of the cavity wave-function, ψ(k). As a result there
is no narrowing of linewidth in momentum space. The
recent MIT experiments [12,13] are an example of an out-
put coupling with an extremely large coupling strength.
In these experiments a short, 5µs RF pulse was used to
couple atoms out of a BEC, making a pulsed atom laser.
We consider here a continuous coupler, turned on at
time t = 0, and examine the resulting long time spectrum
in the external modes described by b†

The longtime expression for Mk(t), Eq. (16) contains two
terms. The ﬁrst of these terms dominates in the case of
small Γ, while the second dominates for very large Γ.
As a result, the long time spectrum has two distinct be-
haviours depending on the strength of the coupling. We
consider the case of slow coupling (small Γ) initially. In
this case, the long time expression for Mk(t) is dominated
by the ﬁrst term in Eq. (16) above, and the resulting long
time spectrum is given by

A plot of the long time spectrum, Eq. (18) as a function
of ωk is presented in Fig. 2 for various coupling strengths.
Fig. 2 shows that for increasing coupling strength the
linewidth of the long time spectrum increases. The val-
ues for Γ chosen correspond approximately to values of

similar to values presented in [11]. However, much
smaller or larger coupling strengths can be achieved by
suitably adjusting the intensities of the lasers and their
detunings. The ﬁgures assume a trap with ground state
123 s−1, typical of magnetic traps
frequency ω0 = 2π
for ultra cold atoms [18]. A ground state gaussian with
106m−1 has been assumed, which corre-
width σk ≈
sponds to a position space wavefunction of size of the
order of 2µm. This value of σk corresponds to a width in
ωk space of σωk ≈
For each of the graphs shown in Fig. 2, the lorentzian
like spectrum is centred about ω0, the ground state fre-
quency of the single mode trap, with the width of the
spectrum dependent on the strength of the coupling as
mentioned above. In all cases, however, the linewidth is
much less than that which would be obtained if the trap

Eq. (18) that the distribution isn’t exactly lorentzian due
to the presence of ωk in the second part of the denomi-
nator. However for large ω0 the spectrum is well approx-
imated by a lorentzian distribution of width

/√ω0.

We have already noted that for large coupling rates,
2, and hence of
the width of the longtime limit of
the longtime spectrum is increased. When Γ is very
/√ω0 >> σωk , the width of Mk(t) becomes
large,
|
large compared with κ(k, t) and the spectrum becomes
dominated by the cavity momentum spread ψ(k). As
a result, for suﬃciently fast coupling (large Γ) the out-
put spectrum changes signiﬁcantly from the lorentzian
shape considered above, and instead reﬂects the momen-
tum spread of the cavity. This is shown in Fig. 3. For
very large Γ the spectrum is centred about zero, and falls
away exponentially in ωk space, as required for a gaussian
distribution in momentum space given by ψ(k).

We have shown that the longtime spectrum from an
output coupler based on state change depends on the
strength of the output coupling. For very strong cou-
pling, the output spectrum is given by the cavity spec-
trum, and is very broad in momentum space. The spec-
trum is then centered about the zero of momentum when
there is no net momentum kick from the lasers. As
the strength of the coupling is reduced, however, the
long time linewidth is correspondingly reduced. For
small coupling strengths the ﬁnal linewidth is eﬀectively
lorentzian, centred about the energy of the cavity with a
linewidth proportional to the coupling strength Γ.

The authors would like to thank Joseph Hope for much

advice and many thoughtful discussions.

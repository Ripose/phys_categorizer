Abstract. We have theoretically investigated the focusing of a launched cloud of
cold atoms. Time-dependent spatially-varying magnetic ﬁelds are used to impart
impulses leading to a three-dimensional focus of the launched cloud. We discuss
possible coil arrangements for a new focusing regime:
isotropic 3D focusing of
atoms with a single magnetic lens. We investigate focusing aberrations and ﬁnd
that, for typical experimental parameters, the widely used assumption of a purely
harmonic lens is often inaccurate. The baseball lens oﬀers the best possibility for
isotropically focusing a cloud of weak-ﬁeld-seeking atoms in 3D.

1. Introduction

The development of laser-cooling techniques [1] has facilitated the preparation of
It is therefore now possible to

modify drastically the centre-of-mass motion of atoms, in direct contrast with the small
angular deﬂection of fast beams studied prior to the development of laser cooling [3].
The (very strong) optical scattering force utilised to cool atoms can also be used
to manipulate their position, as can the (relatively weak) conservative optical dipole
force. Since the dipole force is coherent it represents a better way of manipulating
cooled atoms than the scattering force (for which the random nature of absorption
and spontaneous emission leads to Brownian heating). An alternative method of
manipulating paramagnetic cold atoms is to use the Stern-Gerlach force [4].

One of the goals in the ﬁeld of atom optics [5] is to realise atom-optical elements
that are analogues of conventional optical devices, such as mirrors, lenses and beam-
splitters. An atom mirror reverses the component of velocity perpendicular to the
surface and maintains the component parallel to the surface. An atom lens can
modify both the transverse velocity component and the longitudinal component. To
date, the Stern-Gerlach force has been used to realise ﬂat atomic mirrors [6], curved
atomic mirrors [7], and pulsed mirrors for both cold (thermal) [8] and Bose condensed
atoms [9]. It has also been demonstrated that the surface of a magnetic mirror can
be adapted in real time with corrugations that can be manipulated in times shorter
than the atom-mirror interaction time [10].

There are many reasons for studying focusing of launched cold atoms: atom

lower background pressure [12]; loading miniature magnetic guides [13], atom chips [14]
and storage rings [15]. In comparison to an unfocused cloud, the density of the cloud
can be increased by many orders of magnitude after magnetic focusing.

The ﬁrst demonstration of 3D focusing using pulsed magnetic lenses was
conducted by Cornell et al. [16]. However, their work did not address the optimum
strategy for achieving a compact focused cloud, nor did they discuss the limiting
features for the quality of their atom-optical elements. The group of Gorceix has
performed experiments demonstrating the longitudinal Stern-Gerlach eﬀect with an
atomic cloud using pulsed magnetic forces [17], and an experimental and theoretical
study of cold atom imaging by means of magnetic forces [18]. To date, the experimental
and theoretical studies of pulsed magnetic focusing have been analysed under the
assumption that the magnetic lens potential is harmonic - this work addresses the
validity of this approximation, and the eﬀects of aberrations. We note also that there
has been no theoretical or experimental work on full 3D focusing of cold atoms using
a single magnetic pulse, although this is a very useful focusing strategy.

The scope of this paper is to investigate theoretically and numerically the
limiting factors to the quality and size of the ﬁnal image obtained in pulsed magnetic
focusing experiments; to identify the sources of aberration; and to discuss schemes for
minimising their deleterious eﬀect. In this paper we restrict our attention to focusing
strategies using a single magnetic impulse. A second paper describing more than one
impulse (alternate gradient focusing) [19] is in preparation. Whilst this work shall
concentrate on the analysis for achieving a compact cloud in space, it is also possible
to use pulsed magnetic ﬁelds to reduce the momentum spread of an expanding cloud
with appropriate magnetic impulses. This can be viewed as an implementation of δ-
kick cooling, which has been demonstrated with atoms [20], ions [21] and Bose Einstein
condensates (BEC) [9]. Some of the techniques described here are also successfully
used for the deceleration of polar molecules using time-varying electric ﬁelds [22].
Atom-optical elements realised with light forces [1, 23] are beyond the scope of this
paper.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 outlines the theory
of how to achieve the desired magnetic ﬁelds; Section 3 contains an analysis of
magnetic imaging and minimising the ﬁnal cloud size; Section 4 describes and contrasts
the performance of diﬀerent magnetic lenses; Section 5 contains a discussion and
concluding remarks.

2. Magnetic lens theory

2.1. The Stern-Gerlach force

An atom’s magnetic dipole interaction energy is U = mF gF µBB for a ﬁeld of
magnitude B, where mF is the magnetic quantum number, gF is the Land´e g-factor
and µB the Bohr magneton. We assume that ﬁeld zeros are avoided and that the
magnetic moment adiabatically follows the ﬁeld. Depending on an atom’s hyperﬁne
quantum state, the Stern-Gerlach force F =
B can be used to attract it
towards weak (if mF gF > 0) or strong (if mF gF < 0) magnetic ﬁelds. The choice
of whether atoms in weak or strong-ﬁeld seeking states are launched depends on the
particular application. For some applications, e.g.
loading a remote dipole trap, or
a secondary magneto-optical trap, it does not matter which atomic state is used. In
this work we assume that the ensemble (of alkali metal atoms) has been optically

A purely harmonic magnetic ﬁeld magnitude will result in an aberration-free lens.
In this paper we will consider current-carrying wires assembled to give two diﬀerent
kinds of second order magnetic ﬁeld magnitude:

B0, B1 and B2 are the bias ﬁeld, the axial gradient and the ﬁeld curvature, respectively.
In both cases these parameters are chosen to prevent the ﬁeld magnitude exhibiting
zeros in the region of interest, thus avoiding Majorana spin-ﬂip transitions [24]. The

deﬁnes the centre of the lens. A lens of the form of B1D can be used
either to focus axially or radially; a lens of the form of B3D is used to focus isotropically
in 3D. The accelerations associated with these ﬁelds are harmonic about

The acceleration of equation (3) results in a lens which is axially converging
(diverging) and radially diverging (converging) if B2 is positive (negative). In order to
achieve a 3D focus with such lenses, an axially converging lens pulse must be followed
by an appropriately timed axially diverging lens (or vice versa). This alternate-
gradient focusing strategy is the subject of another paper [19]. In contrast, this paper
details novel lenses which yield accelerations of the form in equation (4). Isotropic 3D
focusing can be achieved with a single lens pulse for atoms in weak-ﬁeld-seeking states,
as Earnshaw’s theorem (which states that a maximum of magnetic ﬁeld magnitude in

2.2. Magnetic ﬁelds from current bars and circular coils

This work considers straight current bars and circular coils for the formation of
lenses. The Biot-Savart law yields magnetic ﬁelds that are analytic for both ﬁnite-
and inﬁnite-length current bars. For circular coils the ﬁeld can be expressed in
terms of elliptic integrals [26]. A discussion of the form of the contours of magnetic
ﬁeld magnitude for various magnetic trapping conﬁgurations has been provided by
Bergeman et al. [27]. The ﬁelds are constrained by Maxwell’s equations, which, in
conjunction with symmetry arguments, allow the spatial dependence of the ﬁelds to

Let us consider two coils of N turns with radius a, separation s, carrying currents

the same sense and a current IAH in opposite senses, i.e. 2IH = I1 +I2, 2IAH = I1

The sign function switches between a single and a double coil. The expressions of

2.3. Conﬁgurations for realising magnetic lenses

There are six distinct coil and current bar conﬁgurations used in this paper for
single-pulse focusing. Figure 1 displays these six strategies, whilst ﬁgure 2 shows the
associated magnetic ﬁeld information. Strategies I-III lead to the axial/radial focusing
of equation (3), whereas strategies IV-VI yield isotropic 3D focusing (equation (4)).
Strategies I-V deal with cylindrically symmetric coil arrangements.

the centre of a single coil; Strategies II and III use the geometric centre of a pair
of coaxial coils (carrying equal currents in the same sense) with separations of
S=0.58 and S=2.63 coil radii, respectively; Strategy IV uses the geometric centre
of a pair of coaxial coils with unequal currents and a relative separation S = √3;

2.3.1. Strategy I: a single coil The magnetic ﬁeld magnitude at the centre of a
single coil of radius a with N I1 current turns is characterised by the coeﬃcients in
equation (9) with S = 0 and using I2 = 0 when evaluating ηH. The radial curvature
is positive, thus, a single coil can be used to radially focus weak-ﬁeld seeking atoms.
However this lens has an axial curvature that is negative and twice the magnitude.

Figure 2. Here we show the respective axial and radial variation of the magnetic
ﬁeld magnitude associated with the six lens strategies I-VI of Figure 1. R, X
and Z are the scaled radial, x and axial displacements from the centre of the
lens, respectively. In Images IV and V the axial gradients in the magnetic ﬁeld
magnitude alter the centre-of-mass velocity of an atom cloud but do not lead to
lensing. Parabolic approximations to the ﬁeld magnitudes are also given.

Figure 1 Strategy I shows the geometry of this lens.

2.3.2. Strategies II, III and IV: a pair of axially-displaced coils For a pair of separated
coaxial coils, where both coils have equal current with the same sense, an axially
diverging (converging) lens is realised for separations less (greater) than the coil radius
(equation (10)). The lens curvature is zero when the separation equals the coil radius
(the Helmholtz condition for achieving uniform ﬁelds). The axial curvature is a factor
of -2 greater than the radial curvature.

2.3.4. Strategy VI: Ioﬀe-Pritchard conﬁguration Ioﬀe-Pritchard (IP) traps are used
extensively for atom trapping and are similar to the Ioﬀe conﬁguration utilised in
plasma conﬁnement [28]. One of the simplest forms of this trap is with a pair of coaxial
coils to generate both a bias ﬁeld, B0, and an axial curvature B2. Four current bars
run parallel to the z-axis, with each bar running through the corner of a square (with
side length w = W a) centred on the axis. The magnitude of the current in each bar
is equal, but neighbouring bars have the opposite current sense.

Here, B′
1 = 4µ0I ′/(πw2), where I ′ is the magnitude of the current in a bar, and the
prime distinguishes it from the axial gradient deﬁned previously. The shape of the
magnetic ﬁeld magnitude contours depend on the geometry of the trap and the ratio
of the coil current to the bar current. Such traps are extensively used in Bose-Einstein
condensation experiments, where an additional circular coil pair is used primarily to
lower the bias ﬁeld B0, yielding an anisotropic harmonic-oscillator potential, with tight
radial conﬁnement B2r = B′
B2/2, and weaker axial conﬁnement B2z = B2.

In BEC experiments variants of the IP trap described above are used, since
inﬁnitely-long current bars are not realisable. An elegant winding pattern is the
baseball geometry. A baseball coil has an axial curvature in addition to a radial
gradient, and these quantities can no longer be independently varied. Figure 1 Strategy
VI shows the cuboidal baseball geometry, where the sides have lengths w = W a,
w = W a and l = La, (l is along the z-axis). The bars carry a current I ′.
It is
impossible to realise a 3D isotropic lens solely by adjusting the aspect ratio of the
coils w/l, and for this reason we add a coaxial pair of coils carrying equal currents in
the same sense (if ηAH

The simplest isotropic lens to calculate is when we use circular Helmholtz coils –
i.e. S = 1, B2 = 0 and the only contribution of the circular coils in equation (13) is
the axial constant ﬁeld B0, which we tune to enable lens isotropy. The ﬁnite-length
current bars lead to a non-trivial relationship among the parameters for realising an
isotropic lens by adjusting the circular coil bias-ﬁeld and curvature. For the purpose
of our calculations we use the parameters W = W = L = 2 for a cubic baseball, with
S = 1 and a relative circular coil current of N I

I ′ = 0.154.

2.4. The harmonicity of the magnetic lenses

The previous subsection was a description of the way to achieve a radially converging
lens with a single coil or a pair of coils; an axially converging lens with a pair of
displaced coils; and three geometries for achieving an isotropic 3D lens. Aberrations
are caused by departures of the actual potential from the ideal harmonic potential.
To measure the degree of departure from harmonicity of a lens, as a function of the
distance from the lens’ centre, we use:

ǫ = |
aH

−
−

aH
a0

,

|

(15)

where aH is the harmonic ﬁt, (equation (3) or (4)), to the full Biot-Savart lens
acceleration aF. The departure from harmonicity is a function of position, and the
cylindrical co-ordinates R and Z are used to plot ǫ(R, Z) for diﬀerent coil systems.
Note the scaled co-ordinates R and Z are normalised to measure length in units of the

for the six diﬀerent focusing strategies.

2.4.1. Strategies I-III: axial/radial focusing Figures 3 I-III show the spatial variation
of the departure from harmonicity of Strategies I-III. For Strategy I, II and III the
departure from harmonicity averaged over a sphere of radius 0.25 a is 0.058, 0.007
and 0.009 respectively. The radially converging lens of Strategy II, and the axially
converging lens of Strategy III are almost an order of magnitude more harmonic than
the single coil radially converging lens of Strategy I.

2.4.2. Strategies IV-VI: isotropic 3D focusing The isotropic 3D lens of Strategy IV
rapidly becomes anharmonic as one moves axially away from the lens centre because of
the axial magnetic ﬁeld zero illustrated in Figure 2 IV. In both Strategy IV and V the
lack of axial symmetry means that there are ﬁrst-order terms in the ﬁeld magnitude,
resulting in a gradient which aﬀects the centre-of-mass motion of the atomic cloud.

Figure 3. The departure from harmonicity ǫ(R, Z) of the six diﬀerent lens
strategies of Fig. 1 is considered for displacements of up to 0.25 coil radii.
Averaged over a sphere of 0.25 times the coil radius, the departures from
harmonicity for the six conﬁgurations are: 0.058, 0.007, 0.009, 0.385, 1.347 and
0.148 respectively.

The main problem with Strategy V is that although both the axial and radial
curvatures are equal at the lens centre, they vary rapidly with position. The lens-
centre curvatures are also 8.4 times weaker than the axial curvature at the centre
of a single coil, leading to longer duration magnetic lensing impulses. The cloud of
atoms therefore experiences the lens’ axial anharmonicities for a greater period, again
compromising the quality of the focus.

Figures 3 IV-VI show the spatial dependence of the departure from harmonicity of
Strategies IV-VI. For Strategy IV, V and VI the departure from harmonicity averaged
over a sphere of radius 0.25 a is 1.347, 0.385 and 0.148 respectively. The IP lens of
Strategy VI is thus signiﬁcantly more harmonic than the two coil lens of Strategy IV,
which is in turn considerably better than the axially oﬀset single coil lens of Strategy
V.

3. Imaging and minimum cloud size

The separable equations of motion for a lens that is harmonic in 3D (equations
(3),(4)) allow us to consider motion in each cartesian dimension as a separate simple
harmonic equation. It is useful to employ the
-matrix formulation used widely
in geometrical optics. The position and velocity of an atom along a given Cartesian
axis, say x, is written as a 2-component vector, and the ﬁnal and initial vectors are
related via the equation:

To simplify the eﬀects of gravity we perform the calculations in a free-falling frame
of reference. In this frame the free evolution of the cloud is an isotropic expansion,
matrix. The inﬂuence of a converging or diverging magnetic

4. Investigating various coil conﬁgurations for pulsed focusing

4.1. Methodology

ABCD

The
matrix formalism outlined above is a useful starting point for studying
pulsed magnetic focusing. However, this formalism ignores magnetic aberrations
arising due to the departure of the real potential from an ideal parabolic spatial
dependence (ﬁgure 3). For a non-parabolic potential the change in position and
velocity which occur during lensing must be calculated numerically. Here, for the ﬁrst
time to our knowledge, we test the ‘perfect’ atomic lens approximations by performing
numerical focusing simulations. The cloud and its motion are treated classically,
and for the atomic densities encountered in the expanding cloud, the collision rate is
negligible. The atoms travel on ballistic trajectories, except when a magnetic impulse
is applied, in which case the full Stern-Gerlach force is included in the numerical
integration. For the sake of deﬁniteness we chose to investigate the focusing of 85Rb
atoms in an atomic fountain launched vertically through a height of 22 cm (which
corresponds to a ﬂight-time of 212 ms), a height which is of interest experimentally.
The atoms come to rest at the apex of their trajectories where they could be used for
further experiments or loaded into a dipole trap. The eﬀects of gravity were included,
but these eﬀects on the quality of focus were found to be negligible for the parameters
used in these simulations.

The approach adopted was a numerical simulation, in which the trajectories
of typically 500 atoms are followed. The initial velocity and position probability
distributions are isotropically Gaussian for each Cartesian direction. The standard
deviation of position was chosen to be a value typical of experiments at 0.4 mm [4],
and the velocity distribution corresponding to a typical launch temperature obtained
with Rb in moving molasses, namely T = 20 µK. These simulations facilitate the
calculation of statistically relevant quantities, such as the standard deviation of the
time-dependent size of the atomic cloud. In all the simulations the maximum current
value in any coil was limited to 10, 000 A.

4.2. Strategies I-III: axial/radial focusing

To illustrate our methodology we discuss the focusing properties of a single, circular,
current-carrying coil (Strategy I). Figure 5 (a) shows the evolution of the x component
of a launched cloud of 500 atoms subject to a radially converging lens constructed from
a single 5 cm radius coil. The impulse is applied half-way in time, and the length of
the impulse is chosen to reverse the transverse velocity, as can be seen from the change
in sign of the gradient after t = 106 ms. For this case, the
matrix predicts a
radial focus with magniﬁcation
1, which is in excellent agreement with the numerical
simulation using a parabolic lens (using the strength of equation (10)). The vertical
line at t = 212 ms corresponds to the imaging time. For real coils, it is seen that
the focussed cloud image is signiﬁcantly larger than the initial cloud. The aberration
worsens as the coil radius decreases. Note that although focusing is seen in the radial
direction, defocusing is seen in the axial direction due to the opposite sign of the
magnetic ﬁeld curvature.

−

Figure 5 (b) contains an analysis of the cloud in terms of shells of diﬀerent radii
measured from the centre of the coil; atoms further from the centre are not focussed
as tightly, and also focus earlier in time. As the ratio between cloud extent and coil
radius decreases, the departure of the ﬁeld from the parabolic approximation becomes

less signiﬁcant. Therefore one method to reduce the aberrations experienced by the
atoms is to increase the coil radius, or decrease the atomic cloud temperature.

We turn our attention to obtaining the minimum cloud size, equation (18), by
investigating the eﬀect of the λ parameter. As discussed in section 3.1, a thin parabolic
lens produces the smallest cloud size when λ
1, i.e. the pulse is applied as late in
time as possible. This is a manifestation of Liouville’s theorem - a more compact
spatial extent can be generated at the expense of a larger velocity spread.

seen that the smallest cloud size for a parabolic lens occurs when one waits as
long as possible before focusing, i.e. λ is as close as possible to 1 (limited by the
solution of equation (24)). This means that the magnetic impulse ends at the desired
focusing time. For parabolic ﬁts to the 3 and 5 cm radius single coils (Strategy I) the
maximum values of λ are 0.968 and 0.929, corresponding to negative magniﬁcations,
M = (1

λ)/λ, of 1/30.1 and 1/13.1 respectively.

Along with the parabolic case, ﬁgure 6 (a) shows numerical simulations for 500
atoms passing through 3 and 5 cm radius coils, for both Strategies I (single coil) and II
(two coils). As expected the 5 cm lens better approximates a parabola. Compared to
the
matrix result there is a marked diﬀerence in the behaviour of the minimum
radially-focussed cloud-size for ﬁelds from real coils – the value of λ at which the
minimum is obtained is dominated by aberrations in the magnetic ﬁeld. The
matrix approach does not provide an adequate description of pulsed magnetic

In ﬁgure 6 (b) the radial expansion factor of a 5 cm single coil (Strategy I) is

The easiest way to reduce aberrations appears to be the use of a very large coil
radius. Unfortunately the curvature of the ﬁeld decreases with the cube of the coil
radius (equation (10)), which necessitates longer pulse durations for larger radius

coils. This increase in pulse duration reduces the maximum value of λ that can be
used and therefore also limits the minimum cloud size. The aberrations can only be
further reduced by increasing the current-turns, something which has experimental
limitations.

ABCD

The aberrations associated with a real coil dramatically aﬀect the strategy for
achieving a radially compact cloud. The impulse has to be applied signiﬁcantly earlier
than an
-matrix analysis would suggest. However, for experimentally-realistic
parameters it is seen that it is possible to achieve a ﬁnal radial cloud size that is smaller
than the initial size. Strategy II (two coils of radius a carrying the same current I,
separated by S = 0.58), clearly has a better performance than Strategy I (single coil),
as seen in ﬁgure 6 (a). Most importantly, in the 5 cm case, the radial extent of the
ﬁnal cloud is 0.75 times the original radial extent of the cloud.

Strategy III produces an axially converging/radially diverging lens with a high
level of harmonicity (ﬁgure 3) comparable to that of Strategy II. We omit our results
for axial focusing in this paper, as it will be revisited in the context of alternate-
gradient focusing in a future publication [19].

4.3. Strategies IV-VI: isotropic 3D focusing

Isotropic 3D focusing can be achieved using two coils with diﬀering currents (Strategy
IV). For realistic experimental parameters, the numerical simulations showed that the
aberrations in the lens smeared out any focusing. However, for unrealistically large
lens radii and large currents (e.g. 15 cm and 200, 000 Amp-turns) it is possible to
achieve 3D focusing.

As discussed in section 2.3.3, a single coil can be made to have isotropic curvature

(Strategy V). At z =
2/7a, the axial and radial curvatures are equal, and
the gradient of the ﬁeld is non-zero. A numerical simulation was performed for a
launched cloud, with an impulse applied when the cloud’s centre of mass reached a
2/7a from the centre of a single coil. Due to the large departure
distance z = +
from harmonicity for the experimentally realistic parameters we used, aberrations
dominated and focusing was not observed.

The baseball lens (Strategy VI) yielded the best isotropic 3D lens. Figure 7 (a)
shows the temporal evolution of the volume expansion factor, (σxσyσz/σxiσyi σzi),
for a launched cloud subject to a focusing pulse from a baseball lens. Five diﬀerent
values of λ are depicted, from 0.3 to 0.7 in steps of 0.1. The bias coils have radii
of a = 5 cm, separation S = 15, and current N I = 3082 A; the baseball has sides
of length W = L = 2 and carries a 10, 000 A current. The minimum cloud size is
obtained when λ = 0.3, and represents a 31.2 increase in cloud volume at the focal
time, T = 212 ms. This is to be contrasted with the 13, 000 increase in cloud volume if
no magnetic lens were used. It is interesting to note that for the parameters we have
and S = 2) are
simulated, the results of a ‘pure’ Ioﬀe-Pritchard lens (W = 2, L

and produces smaller cloud sizes at the focus.

5. Discussion and Conclusion

We have highlighted the limiting size of a focussed launched cold cloud of weak-
ﬁeld seeking atoms for various pulsed magnetic focusing techniques. The
ABCD
matrix formalism is convenient for giving an estimate as to the parameters needed
for magnetic focusing, but does not contain the departure of the potential experienced
by atoms from a perfect parabolic dependence for ﬁelds produced by real coils (and
bars). In this work we have shown how important it is to consider these aberrations
as they drastically alter the results. We have identiﬁed the origin of these aberrations,

Single-impulse magnetic focusing of launched cold atoms

16

and described techniques for minimising them.

We have discussed single coil lenses (Strategy I), as well as ﬁve novel atomic lenses
strategies (II-VI), and tested their aberrations both analytically and numerically. For
all of the Strategies we found that our analytic results for aberrations (section 3) tied
in well with the numerical simulations of section 4. It was demonstrated in Strategies
II and III that a ‘doublet’ radially (axially) focusing lens formed from two coils with
relative separation S = 0.58 (2.63) provided much tighter focusing than the single-coil
lens of Strategy I. Amongst the isotropic 3D lenses we found that the baseball lens
(Strategy VI) was superior to the two coil lens of Strategy IV, which was in turn
considerably better than the axially oﬀset single coil lens of Strategy V. Of the single-
impulse lenses, the baseball lens oﬀers the best possibilities for isotropically focusing
a cloud of weak-ﬁeld-seeking atoms in 3D. Experiments to test these predictions are
underway in our laboratory.

It should be noted that in section 4 we have used the rms radius of a cloud of
atoms to measure how tightly the entire atomic cloud is focused. By only considering
a low-velocity fraction of the atomic distribution, even fractions as large as 50%, it is
possibly to reduce drastically the rms focal spot size, increasing the atomic density by
orders of magnitude. We will address this complex issue in more detail in our future
publication dealing with alternate-gradient focusing [19].

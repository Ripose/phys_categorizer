Abstract

We developed a method to calculate positions and widths of three-body resonances. The method

combines the hyperspherical adiabatic approach, slow variable discretization method (Tolstikhin

et al., J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 29, L389 (1996)), and a complex absorbing potential.

The method can be used to obtain resonances having short-range or long-range wave functions.

In particular, we applied the method to obtain very shallow three-body Eﬁmov resonances for a

model system (Nielsen et al., Phys. Rev. A 66, 012705 (2002)).

INTRODUCTION

The problem of weakly bound states of three resonantly interacting particles, ﬁrst dis-

cussed long ago by Eﬁmov [1], has attracted a particular interest in recent years [2, 3, 4, 5]

owing to the development of reﬁned experimental techniques allowing tunning of the inter-

particle interaction. Now, it has become possible to tune the two-body interaction in such

a way that a shallow two-body bound or virtual state appears.

In this situation, three

particles interacting pairwise through the two-body potential have a series of weakly bound

states [1]. If it happens that in addition to the weakly bound or virtual two-body state,

there is another two-body bound state deeply below, the weakly-bound Eﬁmov states are

able to dissociate into a dimer and a free atom. Therefore, in such a situation, the Eﬁmov

states have ﬁnite lifetimes. These are Eﬁmov resonances [4, 5, 6, 7]. Recently, such Eﬁmov

resonances have been observed in the experiment [5].

Eﬁmov has predicted an universal behavior for the energies of the Eﬁmov states [1]: If

one knows the position, let’s say, of the lowest state, the others can be found using a scaling

law:

En = En−1 exp(2π/ξ) ,

(1)

where ξ is a constant depending on the actual interaction potential. This is possible because

the long-range potential of an Eﬁmov-type system behaves as (ξ2 + 0.25)/(2µρ2), where ρ

is the hyper-radius and µ is the reduced three-body mass. The long-range behavior of the

potential does not depend on details of the short-range two-body interaction. Due to the

same reason, widths of the Eﬁmov resonances are scaled in the same way [6, 7]. Thus, if

one needs to ﬁnd positions and widths of the Eﬁmov resonances for a particular three-body

system, one has to be able to obtain at least one state: The approximate positions (and

widths) of others can be obtained using the scaling law.

Wave functions of such weakly bound Eﬁmov states are mainly situated at large inter-

particle distances. On the other hand, in order to obtain the wave functions, their small-

distance part must be represented accurately, even though the probability density at small

distances could be very small. In this situation, the calculation of the wave functions (of

bound or resonant states) becomes diﬃcult because of the very diﬀerent lengthscales in the

two regions.

Pen’kov [6] previously presented theory of Eﬁmov resonances and calculated six reso-

2

nances for a model two-body interaction potential. In the calculation, he used the formalism

of Faddeev equations. The obtained positions and widths are in agreement with the scaling

law. Later, Nielsen et al.

[7] obtained Eﬁmov resonances for a diﬀerent model potential.

In the calculation they used a diﬀerent approach: adiabatic hyperspherical method coupled

with a multi-channel R-matrix method along the hyper-radius. Using this approach, the

authors obtained the scattering matrix as a function of energy above the lowest dissocia-

tion threshold. Then, widths and positions of the resonances have been obtained from the

variation of the phase shift δ(E) of the scattering matrix.

Here, we are suggesting a diﬀerent approach to calculate widths and positions of three-

body resonances. The approach is general and can be used for weakly bound (long-range)

and deeply-bound (short-range) resonances. The method also uses the hyperspherical co-

ordinates similar to Ref.

[7].

Instead of solving a multi-channel scattering problem, we

suggest to employ the slow variable discretization (SVD) [8] method with adapted grid step

[9] in hyper-radius and hyperangles. As a basis set in hyper-radius we use the sine-DVR

(discrete variable representation) method [10, 11]. At a large hyper-radius, we place a com-

plex absorbing potential (CAP) to absorb the dissociating ﬂux. Positions and widths of the

three-body resonances are obtained as real and imaginary parts of complex eigenvalues of

the resulting Hamiltonian of the system.

The article is organized in the following way. In section II we present our approach of

calculation of the three-body resonances. Then, in section III, we apply the method to

obtain a single resonance of three particles interacting through a potential with a barrier

[12]. The wave function of the resonance is situated mainly at relatively short distances. The

second application of the developed method is discussed in section IV, where we calculate

several Eﬁmov resonances for three particles interacting through a two-body short-range

potential with a large two-body scattering length. We compare our results with a previous

theoretical study [7]. Finally, in section V, we discuss advantages and possible applications

of the method.

II. METHOD

A. Hyperspherical coordinates used in the present method

In our approach we assume that the total angular momentum of the three-body system

is zero. Thus, only three interparticle coordinates determine the conﬁguration of the sys-

tem. We represent the three interparticle coordinates by the Smith-Whitten hyperspherical

coordinates [13]. The formulas of the actual version of the coordinates can be found in Refs.

[9, 13]. We use the same notations as Ref. [9]. For a graphical view of the coordinates we

refer the reader to Fig. 6 of Ref. [14] and Fig. 1 of Ref. [9]. In those studies the hyperangle

φ changes in the interval [0; 2π]. For systems with three identical particles (symmetry group

C3v), which are only considered in this study, the possible irreducible representations are A1,

A2, and E. In order to represent A1 or A2 wave functions, it is enough to consider a smaller

interval of φ, namely [π/6; π/2]. Wave functions of the E irreducible representation require a

larger interval [π/6; 7π/6]. The systems considered here have A1 resonances only. However,

the method works for other irreducible representations and can be adapted to systems with

non-identical particles. The second hyperangle θ changes in the interval [0; π/2]. The shape

of a three-particle conﬁguration is determined by the two hyperangles, the overall size of

the system is determined by the hyper-radius ρ

[0;

). Therefore, the hyper-radius is the

natural dissociation coordinate for the three-body system.

B. The adiabatic hyperspherical approximation

For a three-body system interacting through the potential V (ρ, θ, φ), we have to solve

the Schr¨odinger equation

ˆ
T
h

(ρ, θ, φ) + V (ρ, θ, φ)

Φn(ρ, θ, φ) = Evib

n Φn(ρ, θ, φ)

(2)

to obtain the vibrational three-body wave function Φn(ρ, θ, φ) and eigenenergy Evib

n . In this

study, V (ρ, θ, φ) is given by a sum of two-body potentials. The present method does not use

that property of the potential and works for potentials that are not separable into a simple

sum of the three two-body terms. It is well known that realistic three-body potentials cannot

be represented in such a way.

One way of solving Eq. (2) is to use the hyperspherical adiabatic approach, treating the

i

4

hyper-radius as an adiabatic coordinate. Then, Eq. (2) is solved in a two-step procedure.

In the ﬁrst step, one ’freezes’ the hyper-radius at ρi and solves the Schr¨odinger equation in

two-dimensional space of hyperangles

H ad

ρi ϕa(ρi; θ, φ) = Ua(ρi)ϕa(ρi; θ, φ),

(3)

where ϕa(ρi; θ, φ) is the hyperangular wave function at hyper-radius ρi for the ath eigenvalue
Ua(ρi) (see, for example, Fig. 8). The Hamiltonian H ad
ρi

is obtained from the full Hamil-

tonian of Eq. (2) by ﬁxing the hyper-radius. The eigenenergies Ua(ρi) are called adiabatic

potentials. Once Ua(ρi) are obtained, Eq. (2) is written in the well-known form of a system

of coupled diﬀerential equations

h

ψa,n(ρ) +

[Wa,a′(ρ)ψa′,n(ρ)] = Evib

(4)

where T (ρ) is the kinetic energy operator associated with hyper-radial motion, Wa,a′(ρ) are
the coupling terms between the diﬀerent channels a and a′, and ψa,n(ρ) is the ath-channel

component of the hyper-radial wave function. Assuming that the complete set of adiabatic

channels a is included in Eq. (4), the solutions of Eqs. (2) and (4) are equivalent. As it

is also well-known, sharp ρ-dependence of the coupling terms Wa,a′(ρ) makes the numerical

solution of Eq. (4) diﬃcult.

C. Mapped DVR method and slow variable discretization

The slow variable discretization method suggested by Tolstikhin et al. [8] is used to take

into account the adiabatic couplings between the adiabatic states ϕa(ρi; θ, φ) in a diﬀerent

way. We give only the formulas that are used in the current work. The detailed discussion of

SVD can be found in Ref. [8]. The total vibrational eigenstate Φ(ρ, θ, φ) (index n is omitted

here) is represented as an expansion in the basis formed by the adiabatic states ϕa(ρi; θ, φ)

obtained from Eq. (3). The expansion coeﬃcients are ψa(ρi):

Φ(ρ, θ, φ) =

ψa(ρi)ϕa(ρi; θ, φ) ,

where the sum is over all channels a. Expanding the hyper-radial wave function in a complete

basis set πj(ρ)

We use a DVR basis

to represent the hyper-radial part of wave functions. Since the

πii

|

weakly bound states and resonances have wave functions extending to large distances, we

use a variable grid step for DVR basis functions similarly as we did in Refs. [9, 15]. Namely,

we introduce a new variable x such that ρ = ρ(x). The grid steps ∆ρ and ∆x along ρ and

x correspondingly are linked to each other as ∆ρ = J(x)∆x, where J(x) = dρ/dx. We may

set ∆x to be 1 and, therefore, ∆ρ = J(x).

In practice, ﬁrst, we choose the dependence

∆ρ(ρ). Once ∆ρ(ρ) is chosen, the grid step in ρ automatically determines J(x). Then the

J(x)dx gives the dependence ρ(x). Changing the variable ρ to x in the kinetic

integral
energy operator ˆT (ρ) and the wave function ψ to ˜ψ = √Jψ, Eq. (9) becomes

(11)

where ˜cia =

J(xi)cia. The matrix of the kinetic energy operator ˜T (x) is determined once

the DVR basis set πi(x) is chosen. Previously, we have used complex exponents, exp(ikxi)

p

as DVR basis functions. However, as it was pointed out in Refs. [10, 11], the sine function

basis, sin(ikxi) has a certain advantage: zero boundary conditions at the ends of the grid are

better represented by the sine functions than by the complex exponents. So, in this study

6

we use the sine DVR basis. The actual form of the orthonormal DVR sine basis functions

πi(x) is well known. See, for example, Eqs (5-7) of Ref.
[10]. To calculate the matrix
elements ˜Ti′i of the kinetic energy operator we use an approach similar to the one described
in Refs.[10, 11]. The matrix ˜Tii′ can be represented as the following matrix product

To represent wave functions of loosely-bound states we choose a smaller step ∆ρi = J(xi)

in the regions where the wave functions oscillate a lot, and a larger grid step for the regions

where the wave functions change smoothly. One possibility is to connect the grid step ∆ρ

to the local kinetic energy [9, 15]:

∆ρ = β

This approach of choosing ∆ρ gives good results in the regions where the WKB applicability

condition is satisﬁed. In other situations, around classical turning points, for example, one

needs to take a smaller step.

D. Complex absorbing potential

A complex absorbing potential is used to simulate an inﬁnite hyper-radial grid (see Ref.

[16] and references therein). The CAP is placed at the end of the grid and, therefore, absorbs

the outgoing dissociation ﬂux of decaying resonant states. The length and the strength of

CAP are chosen to minimize its eﬀect: the outgoing ﬂux should be completely absorbed and

should not be reﬂected back to the internal region. The CAP is purely imaginary and added

to the adiabatic potentials Ua(ρ). This makes the Hamiltonian non-Hermitian. Solving the

generalized complex eigenvalue problem of Eq. (7) the eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian are

where E′ is the position of the resonance and Γ is the resonance linewidth (inverse of lifetime)

E = E′

(17)

obtained in the form

[17].

In literature, diﬀerent types of CAPs are used (see Ref. [16] and references therein). In

our calculations, we use quadratic and exponential forms of CAP. The widths and positions

of the resonances do not depend on the form of CAP if the length and strength are chosen

appropriately (see Table I). The optimal lengths and strengths of the CAPs are determined

using the de Broglie wavelength of the dissociating products according to guidelines provided

in Ref.

[16].

In this case, the dissociating products are a dimer plus a free atom. The

kinetic energy of the dissociating products, from which we get the de Broglie wavelength, is

the diﬀerence between the three-body bound state energy of the resonance, Etrimer, and the

dissociation energy of the ground state adiabatic curve, Ediss (see inset in Fig. 2).

E. Reduced grid and variable grid-step in 2D space of hyperangles

In this study, we are interested only in vibrational states of the A1 irreducible represen-

tation. Such states can be represented by reduced interval [π/6; π/2] of the hyperangle φ.

(Examples of A1 functions are given in Figs. 8 and 9). Using Neumann boundary conditions

∂ϕa(φ = π/6)
∂φ

=

∂ϕa(φ = π/2)
∂φ

= 0 ,

(18)

we are able to represent states of the A1 irreducible representation. To represent states with

A2 symmetry, we would have to impose Dirichlet boundary conditions. Such states come

8

up in systems of fermions, for example (assuming that only the vibrational part of the total

wave function determines the symmetry of the state). To represent Ea or Eb states, we

would need to change our φ interval to [π/6,7π/2] and our boundary conditions according

to Ea (symmetric, Neumann) or Eb (antisymmetric, Dirichlet) representation.

We also employ a variable grid in hyperangles because the hyperangular wave functions

are extremely localized when the hyper-radius is large. This occurs particularly in the

asymptotic region of hyper-radius, where the hyperangular wave function is nonzero only

in a small hyperangular region representing the dimer plus free atom conﬁguration. For

example, in the upper-left frame of Fig. 9, we see the hyperangular wave function very

localized near θ = π/2 and φ = π/6. The variable step size in the hyperangles, used in

this study, is shown in Fig. 1. The step size in θ, becomes smaller as θ approaches π/2,

while the step size in φ, approaches zero as φ approaches π/6. In principle, it is possible to

use diﬀerent dependences like those shown in Fig. 1 for diﬀerent hyper-radii. It would save

some computation time. However, in this study, we use the same hyperangular grid for all

values of ρi.

III. EXAMPLE: THREE PARTICLES INTERACTING THROUGH A TWO-

BODY POTENTIAL WITH A BARRIER

A. Our results

To test our method, ﬁrst, we applied it to a simple model system that consists of three

bosons with nucleon mass, m1 = m2 = m3 = 1837.5773 a.u. (939 MeV) [12]. The three-

body potential V (r12, r23, r31) in the Schr¨odinger equation, Eq.

(2), is constructed as a

sum of pairwise potentials: V (r12, r23, r31) = V2(r12) + V2(r23) + V2(r31), where the pairwise

interaction V2(r) is given by:

V2(r) =

−

55e−0.2r2

+ 1.5e−0.01(r−5)2

,

(19)

in MeV and the distance r is in fm. The two-body potential has a two-body bound state at

E(2) = -6.76 MeV [12].

As the ﬁrst step, we obtain the adiabatic energy curves. The resulting adiabatic potentials

are shown in Fig. 2. The lowest potential at ρ

corresponds to a decay into a dimer and

→ ∞

a free atom. The dissociation energy of the ground state (Ediss in Fig. 2) corresponds to the

dimer binding energy E(2). All other channels dissociate into three free atoms. If the energy

of a three-body state is above the lowest dissociation limit, the system may dissociate, with

the excess of energy transferred into the kinetic energy of the dissociating products.

With our method, we are able to calculate three-body resonances and bound states. We

ﬁnd that there is only one three-body bound state at E0 = -37.35 MeV. This result is in

agreement with the previous study by Fedorov et al. [12] giving E0 = -37.22 MeV. Figure 3

shows the multi-channel hyper-radial wave function ψ(ρ) of this state.

Due to a potential barrier in the pairwise interaction, the lowest adiabatic state also has

a barrier. If the barrier is high enough, one or more resonances (pre-dissociated states) may

exist with the energy above the lowest dissociation limit (dimer + free particle). The energy

interval between the dissociation limit and the top of the barrier is roughly from -7 MeV to

-5 MeV.

Most of the eigenvalues of Eq. (11) are neither bound states nor resonances: these are

just states of the continuum spectrum. To distinguish the resonances from the continuum

states, we may look into their wave functions or carry out calculations for a diﬀerent grid

length and CAP parameters of the grid: Positions and widths of resonances should be stable

long-living states that tunnel through the potential barrier as shown in the inset. Note logarithmic

scale in hyper-radius.

with respect to the change of the grid length and CAP parameters. We have found only

one resonance for this system with energy -5.32 MeV and halfwidth 0.11 MeV. The wave

function of the resonance is shown in Fig. 4. The ground state component of the hyper-

radial wave function has non-negligible components both inside the bound region as well

as in the continuum region, as expected for a resonant state. Note that the ground state

component of the hyper-radial wave function, ψ1, is at least one order of magnitude greater

than any other component, meaning that this state ’lives’ mostly in the ground adiabatic

curve. Nevertheless, the presence of other components means that non-adiabatic couplings

are not negligible. The signiﬁcance of the non-adiabatic coupling is also demonstrated in

Fig. 6, which demonstrates the convergence of the results with respect to a diﬀerent number

of adiabatic channels included in Eq. (11): One channel is not enough to obtain an accurate

result, two channels provide a much better accuracy. To compare with Fig. 4, a continuum

wave function for vibrational state with energy E =

6.4 MeV is shown in Fig. 5. An

−

important diﬀerence with the resonant wave function is that the continuum wave function

is situated mainly in the outer region of the hyper-radius, not reaching the potential well.

For two-body systems, the complex energy of resonances does not depend on the shape of

CAP, if CAP is smooth enough. So, we have also checked the convergence of our results with

respect to diﬀerent types of CAPs. Namely, we compared the quadratic and exponential

CAPs. As expected, we found that the energy of the only resonance depends only weakly

on the CAP parameters. Table I compares the results obtained with the quadratic and

exponential CAP.

has a considerable amplitude in the region of the potential well (around 10−4 a.u.). This can

be compared with the continuum wave function shown in Fig. 5, for which the potential-well

amplitude is very small. Comparing the amplitudes of the diﬀerent components, it is clear that
10−3

the principal contribution is due to the lowest adiabatic state. CAP is placed around ρ = 4

×

a.u., the distance at which the outgoing dissociation ﬂux starts to be absorbed.

B. Comparison with previous study

Having developed the described method, we have tested it on the present system because

it was previously considered in Ref.

[12]. We have obtained the energy of the only bound

state, which is agreement with the mentioned study. However, the position (-5.319 MeV)

and halfwidth (0.112 MeV) of the resonance do not agree with Ref. [12], that gives position

-5.96 MeV and halfwidth 0.40 MeV. This came as a surprise because the calculation for the

second three-body system considered here is in a good agreement with a previous work [7].

The reason of the disagreement is not clear. We are conﬁdent about the adiabatic states

obtained in this study because we have obtained the same bound state as Fedorov et al. We

are conﬁdent about the one-channel calculation giving a value of the complex energy, which

is quite close to the converged value. The one-channel code does not use SVD at all and we

have tested it on diatomic molecules with a barrier.

As an additional test, we have carried out a calculation based on the WKB approximation.

a reliable result for this situation.

In Ref.

[12] the situation could

be diﬀerent because no CAP was used. Instead, a complex scaling variable was employed.

However, the complex scaling variable plays a role of an absorber. It is possible that if the

absorbed is too short, it must reﬂect partially the outgoing dissociation ﬂux.

To provide an insight into the hyperangular part of the total wave function, in Figs. 8 and

9 we give hyperangular wave functions calculated for two diﬀerent values of hyper-radius,

ρ = 0.001 and 0.01 a.u., correspondingly. For the small hyper-radius, the adiabatic states are

delocalized. For the large hyper-radius, the lowest state is strongly localized: the amplitude

is not zero only in the region where φ

approach and the hyper-radial coordinates. Instead of solving the eigenvalue problem along

the hyper-radius, in Ref.

[7] the three-body scattering problem was considered. Namely,

the energy-dependent scattering matrix S(E) was obtained for energies above the lowest

dissociation limit (deeply bound dimer + a free particle). For the present situation when

there is only one open channel, S(E) is a scalar function of E: S = e2iδ(E). The positions

and widths of the resonances have been obtained considering the phase-shift δ(E). We use

the results by Nielsen et al. [7] to test the present method.

Since the Eﬁmov states are very weakly bound, their wave functions extend to very large

distances. For example, the minimum of the lowest adiabatic state is around 1 a.u., but the

exponentially decaying tail in the closed channel of the fourth Eﬁmov resonance reaches the

distance of 105 a.u. (See Fig. 1 of Ref. [7].) At the same time, the component of the wave

when hyper-radius is large. Therefore, in order to represent the complete wave function,

one has to have a grid with a large number of points. Nielsen et al. [7] have used about 3

millions grid points in the interval 0.1 < ρ < 106 a.u.

Our method allows us to use a much smaller grid. The exponentially decaying tail can be

represented with a modest number of grid points (DVR points in our method). This can be

made with a variable grid step, which grows logarithmically with hyper-radius. However, to

be able to use the logarithmically-growing step, one has to absorb the outgoing dissociative

ﬂux at a small distance where the grid step is still small and the oscillating component of

the wave function is still represented properly. Thereore, we place the absorbing potential

TABLE II: Comparison of complex energies obtained in this work using diﬀerent number of included

adiabatic states with the results of Nielsen et al.

[7]. The imaginary part of the energies is the

halfwidth of the resonances. The overall agreement is good except for the position of the 4th

resonance, which is probably not represented accurately in this study: the grid is not long enough

in the present calculation. In Ref. [7], six adiabatic states have been used.

at the lowest adiabatic potential only at a small distance.

In a typical calculation, the variable grid in ρ has only 340 points and extends from 0.002

to 20,000 a.u. The grid step is constant from ρ = 0.002 to 0.1 a.u. This region corresponds

to the minimum of the two lowest adiabatic states (Fig. 1 of Ref.

[7]). From ρ = 1 a.u.

the grid step changes logarithmically with ρ: ∆ρ = 0.04ρ. We use a quadratic absorbing

potential placed at the lowest adiabatic state. CAP starts at ρ =12 a.u; its length is L = 10

a.u., and the strength A2 = 11 a.u. The parameters L and A2 are chosen according to Ref.

[16] in order to minimize reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients for the outgoing dissociation

ﬂux. In the calculation we used only 4 adiabatic states. The calculation of the four adiabatic

states and the corresponding wave functions at 340 grid points of ρ is made in parallel on 96

processors and took about an hour. The size of the matrix for the hyper-radial eigenvalue

problem is (340

on a single processor and takes also about one hour. With the modest calculation eﬀort,

we have obtained all four Eﬁmov resonances with a reasonable accuracy. Table II compares

calculated energies and widths of the Eﬁmov resonances with the results from Ref.

[7].

To give an idea about the wave function of an Eﬁmov resonance, Fig. 10 shows the four

components of the third resonance. The wave function ’lives’ mainly in the ﬁrst excited

adiabatic state: the probability to ﬁnd the system in the ﬁrst excited state is the largest.

Regular oscillations are present mainly in the lowest adiabatic state, which corresponds to

19

the open dissociation path. Beyond 20 a.u., the oscillations decay because of the complex

absorbing potential. Smaller oscillations visible in other adiabatic states are due to the

coupling to the lowest state. Oscillations along the states decay with the distance ρ because

the coupling becomes smaller and the system can dissociate only through the lowest state.

of the corresponding adiabatic states to ϕ1(ρ; θ, φ). This is a generic property of the hyperspherical

adiabatic approach: the couplings between adiabatic states decays slowly with ρ. Beyond ρ = 20

a.u., the oscillations on the lowest adiabatic state are damped due to the presence of the absorbing

potential.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a method to calculate three-body bound states and resonances. The

method uses the adiabatic hyperspherical approach, slow variable discretization, sine DVR

basis set, and a complex absorbing potential placed at a large the hyper-radius. Using the

hyper-radius as a dissociation coordinate allows us to account for two-body and three-body

20

breakup uniformly.

If needed the three-body and two-body dissociation channels could

be distinguished by inspecting the asymptotic behavior of resonance wave functions. To

simplify the calculation, we employed a variable grid step in the two hyperangles and hyper-

radius. In practice, the optimal variable change should be adapted to the given three-body

potential.

We have applied the developed method to two diﬀerent three-body systems of identi-

cal particles interacting through pairwise potential. However, the method works also for

distinguishable particles as well as for intrinsically three-body potentials. The ﬁst system

consisted of particles interacting through the two-body potential with a barrier. Our cal-

culation for the only bound state is in agreement with the previous study [12]. However,

the position and width of the only resonance does agree with Ref.

[12]. The reason for

this disagreement is not clear. We believe that our result is correct. The second system

considered here has four weakly bound resonances: Eﬁmov resonances [7]. The widths and

positions of the resonances obtained in the present study are in good agreement with results

of Ref. [7].

Among the advantages of the developed method is a relatively modest basis set along the

hyper-radius. For example, Nielsen et al. had to use several million grid points along the

hyper-radius to obtain converged results. We needed only 340 points. For a better precision,

this number could be doubled. Another advantage is that the method does not rely on non-

adiabatic coupling terms, which are diﬃcult to represent accurately on a coarse hyper-radial

grid. Most of the calculation can be done on a parallel computer, only the last step, which

is relatively short, should be done on a single processor. This is an important advantage in

view of the availability of parallel computers. The method works for intrinsically three-body

potential and can be easily adapted for distinguishable particles.

The method can be used in a number of problems dealing with long-living states of

systems with several degrees of freedom, if a dissociation coordinate could be separated from

other coordinates. Such a dissociation coordinate should be used as an adiabatic coordinate.

The other coordinates could be treated in the same way as the two hyperangles in the present

approach. Depending on how good is the ’adiabaticity’ of the dissociation coordinate, the

number of adiabatic channels to include could be diﬀerent: for the dissociation coordinate

that is not adiabatic (slow), one may need to include many channels for convergence. Among

possible applications of the method could be two-electron or electron-positron problems, pre-

21

dissociation of small polyatomic molecules, and decay of nuclei.

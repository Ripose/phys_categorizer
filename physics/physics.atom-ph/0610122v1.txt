Abstract

The m α6 correction to energy is expressed in terms of an effective Hamiltonian H (6) for an arbitrary

state of helium. Numerical calculations are performed for n = 2 levels and the previous result for 23P

centroid is corrected. While the resulting theoretical predictions for the ionization energy are in a moderate

agreement with experimental values for 23S1, 23P , and 21S0 states, they are in a signiﬁcant disagreement

for the singlet state 21P1.

High precision calculation of helium energy levels including relativistic and QED effects is a

complicated task [1]. It has been early recognized that the two-electron Dirac-Coulomb Hamilto-

nian is only an approximate Hamiltonian, as it includes negative spectrum and it does not account

for magnetic and higher order interactions between electrons. The proper approach has to be

based on Quantum Electrodynamic theory. For heavy few-electron ions the interactions between

electrons can be treated perturbatively on the same footing as the electron self-interaction and the

vacuum polarization. Highly accurate results have been obtained for heavy helium- and lithium-

like ions [2, 3], and the convenient form of this 1/Z expansion has been introduced a few years

ago by Shabaev in [4]. For systems with a larger number of electrons the zeroth order Hamil-

tonian will include an effective local potential to approximately account for interactions between

electrons. This approach is being developed by Sapirstein et al [5], and more recently by Shabaev

and collaborators [6]. One of the most interesting results obtained so far, was the calculation of

QED corrections to parity violation in cesium atom [6].

For light atomic systems the relativistic and QED effects are only a small correction to the

nonrelativistic Hamiltonian, and for this reason they can be treated perturbatively. More precisely,

this perturbative approach relies on expansion of the binding energy in powers of the ﬁne structure

constant α,

E(α) = E(2) + E(4) + E(5) + E(6) + E(7) + O(α8)

(1)

where E(n) = m αn E (n) is a contribution of order αn, which may contain ﬁnite powers of ln α.

Each contribution E (n) can be expressed in terms of the expectation value of some effective Hamil-

tonian H (n) with the nonrelativistic wave function [7]. This approach allows one for a consistent

inclusion of all relativistic and QED effects order by order in α. We present in this work high pre-

cision calculation of n = 2 energy levels in helium including the most difﬁcult contribution E(6).

This contribution has already been derived separately for triplet states in [8, 9] and for singlet

states in [10, 11]. Here, we obtain H (6) which is valid for all helium states and present numerical

results for 23S1, 23P, 21S0 and 21P1 energy levels

The leading term in the expansion of energy in powers of α, E (2) = E is the nonrelativistic

energy, the eigenvalue of the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian, which in atomic units is

but separate matrix elements of the ﬁrst and the second term in the above are divergent. The spin

dependent terms which contribute to ﬁne structure, are ﬁnite and have been derived by Douglas

and Kroll in [8]. These contributions are not included here, because we consider spin-orbit av-

eraged levels. The singularities of matrix elements in Eq.

(7) can be eliminated by algebraic

transformations [11] in a similar way for both singlet and triplet states. Therefore we extend the

The higher order contribution E (7) is known only to some approximation. Following Ref. [13]

the hydrogenic values for one-, two-, and three-loop contributions [14] at order m α7 are extrapo-

lated to helium, according to

E (7) =

E (7)(1S, He+) + E (7)(nX, He+)

for X = S and for states with higher angular momenta E (7)(nX, He+) is neglected.

with random αi, βi, γi [15]. This basis set is a very effective representation of the two-electron

wave function, namely the nonrelativistic energies with 1500 basis functions are accurate to about

18 digits. Moreover, matrix elements of operators for relativistic and higher order corrections

can all be obtained analytically in terms of rational, logarithmic and dilogarithmic functions, for

Numerical results for matrix elements of m α6 operators with singlet and triplet P states are pre-

sented in Table I, due to singularity of these operators we had to use octuple precision arithmetics.

The m α6 correction to energy involves also second order matrix elements Esec. If we write

cancellation between m α6 contributions and the Dirac energy for the He+ ion, the subtotal line in

Table II. Because of this cancellation, the dominant contribution is the one loop radiative correc-

tion, with the exception of 21P1 state, where the wave function at the nucleus happens to be very
close to 16, the He+ value, see Table I.

The summary of all important contributions to ionization energies is presented in Table III. We

include the ﬁrst and second order mass polarization correction to the nonrelativistic energy as well

as ﬁrst order nuclear recoil corrections α4 m2/M and α5 m2/M. We expect higher order terms

in the mass ratio to be much below the 0.01 MHz, the precision of calculated contributions, see

Table III. Results for nonrelativistic as well as for leading relativistic corrections are in agreement

with those obtained previously by Drake [13, 16]. Corrections of order m α5 were calculated

using Drake and Goldman [17] values for Bethe logarithms. m α6 correction is calculated in this

work. All but m α7 contributions are calculated exactly. This last one, m α7 is estimated on the

basis of hydrogenic value according to Eq. (16). It is the only source of uncertainty of theoretical

predictions, as the achieved numerical precision for each correction is below 0.01 kHz.

The value for 21S0 state has already been presented in our former work [11], here we display
in more details all the contributions. The value for 23S1 state is in agreement with our previous
calculation in [9], where we obtained E (6) = 3.496 93(50).

It justiﬁes that obtained result is

correct, since both derivations of m α6 operators were performed in a different way. However, the

result for 23P state is in disagreement with our result from [18], therefore we checked Ref. [18]

and found a mistake. The derived set of operators representing E (6) was correct, but the expectation
value of H ′
EN i = 11.903 751.
With the second order matrix element −15.838 656(9) and subtracting He+ m α6 energy −Z 6/16,

EN , in the notation of [18], was in error. The correct result is hH ′

it is equal to 0.049 702(9), while the former result was 0.140 689(9), see Table II of [18]. Together

with other corrections from that Table the total m α6 contribution becomes −1.170 188(9), in

agreement with the result obtained here.

We ﬁnd a moderate agreement with experimental ionization energies for 21S0, 23S1 and 23P
states but a disagreement for 21P1 state. Following [13] the result for 23S1 state was obtained by
combining 23S1−33D1 measurement by Dorrer et al [19] 786 823 850.002(56) MHz with theoreti-
cal 33D1 ionization energy 366 018 892.97(2) by Drake [13, 16]. Ionization energy of 23P was ob-

9

tained from the measurement by of 23S1−23P transition Cancio et al [20] of 276 736 495.6246(24)
MHz and the previously obtained 23S1 ionization energy. Ionization energy of 21S state was ob-
tained from measurements of 21S − n1D transitions by Lichten et al [21] with n = 7 − 20 and

Drake’s calculations for n1D states [13, 16]. Finally, the result for 21P ionization energy is deter-

mined by combining 21P − 31D2 transition 448 791 404.0(30) MHz by Sansonetti and Martin [22]
(including correction of 0.6 MHz [13]) with calculated [13, 16] 31D2 energy 365 917 749.02(2)
MHz. The signiﬁcant disagreement with theoretical predictions for 21P state calls for independent

calculation of m α6 term and on the other side for the direct frequency measurement of 21P −31D2
or 21P − 21S transitions.

Further improvement of theoretical predictions can be achieved by the calculation of m α7 con-

tribution. The principal problem here will be the numerical calculation of the relativistic correc-

tions to Bethe-logarithms and the derivation of remaining operators. Such calculation has recently

been performed for helium ﬁne structure [24], therefore in view of newly proposed experiments

[25], calculations for other states of helium although not simple, can be achieved.

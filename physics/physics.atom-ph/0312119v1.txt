Cold supersonic beams of molecules can be slowed down using a switched sequence of electrostatic
ﬁeld gradients. The energy to be removed is proportional to the mass of the molecules. Here we
report deceleration of 174YbF, which is 7 times heavier than any molecule previously decelerated.
We use an alternating gradient structure to decelerate and focus the molecules in their ground
state. We show that the decelerator exhibits the axial and transverse stability required to bring
these molecules to rest. Our work signiﬁcantly extends the range of molecules amenable to this
powerful method of cooling and trapping.

It has recently become possible to decelerate cold su-
personic beams of light polar molecules in suitable ex-
cited states using electrostatic forces. This has been
demonstrated with beams of CO [1], ND3 [2, 3], and
OH [4]. Once the molecules are suﬃciently slow they can
be trapped electrostatically [3, 5]. The key feature of an
electrostatic decelerator is that molecules move through
the fringe ﬁeld of a capacitor from low to high electric
ﬁeld. If the molecules are weak-ﬁeld-seekers the increase
in their potential energy causes them to slow down. The
ﬁeld is then switched oﬀ and the molecules ﬂy out of the
capacitor without being accelerated. With many capac-
itors along the beam line, this process can be repeated
until the molecules are brought to rest. The highest elec-
tric ﬁelds are on the surfaces of the electrodes, resulting in
a transverse force towards the beam axis that focuses the
weak-ﬁeld-seeking molecules as they propagate through
the decelerator [3].

Until now, no ground state beam has been deceler-
ated because ground state molecules are strong-ﬁeld seek-
ers. Strong-ﬁeld-seekers can be decelerated by reversing
the charging sequence so that the ﬁeld is oﬀ when the
molecules enter each capacitor and switched on before
they leave. However, Maxwell’s equations prevent the
simple focussing that weak-ﬁeld seekers enjoy because it
is not possible to have a static maximum of electric ﬁeld
in free space [6]. This diﬃculty can be overcome by the
method of alternating gradient focussing, whereby a se-
quence of alternating focussing and de-focussing lenses
results in a net focussing eﬀect. Recently a beam of
strong-ﬁeld-seeking CO molecules in the metastable a3Π
state was slowed from 275 m/s to 260 m/s in such a de-
celerator [7]. Here we report the deceleration and fo-
cussing of a supersonic 174YbF beam in the ground state
X 2Σ+(v = 0, N = 0) and we show that it is feasible
to bring such molecules to rest. These are seven times
heavier than any molecules previously decelerated, so the

amount of kinetic energy to be removed is proportionally
larger. If the number of decelerator stages is to remain
practical each stage must remove a large amount of en-
ergy. Much more energy can be removed from heavy
molecules in their ground state than in any weak-ﬁeld-
seeking state.

The ability to decelerate heavy molecules and ground
state molecules greatly extends the range of species
amenable to this powerful method of cooling and trap-
ping. YbF is of particular interest because it oﬀers one of
the most sensitive ways to search for elementary particle
physics beyond the standard model through a measure-
ment of the electric dipole moment of the electron [8].
This important quantity can be measured more sensi-
tively by slowing the molecules. Furthermore, decelera-

tion would enhance experiments that study possible con-
nections between the homochirality of biomolecules and
parity violation [9, 10] and would improve the sensitivity
of nuclear anapole measurements [11].

Our beam line is shown in Fig. 1(a). The supersonic
source uses 4 bar of Ar, Kr or Xe mixed with a small frac-
tion of SF6 as the carrier gas. A solenoid valve releases
this gas every 0.2 s in 100 µs pulses that expand through
a nozzle into a vacuum of ∼ 5 × 10−5 mbar. A disk of Yb
is positioned immediately outside the nozzle. The edge
of this disk is ablated by the unfocussed 1064 nm out-
put of a 10 ns, 20 mJ pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The Yb and
SF6 react to form YbF, which becomes entrained in the
gas pulse and thermalizes with it. The molecules then
pass through a 1 mm-diameter skimmer, 82 mm from the
nozzle, into a high vacuum. This source produces YbF
beams as slow as 290 m/s with translational and rota-
tional temperatures as low as 1.4 K [12]. A 552 nm laser
beam, the velocity selector, crosses the molecular beam
108 mm downstream from the skimmer. This laser beam
pumps molecules out of the ground state except during an
adjustable period of typically 10-20 µs when it is switched
oﬀ. The moment at which a molecule crosses the laser
beam is mainly determined by its speed. Consequently,
the resulting pulse of ground state molecules is a veloc-
ity group whose width and center are determined by the
timing of the laser pulse. A further 4 mm downstream
the molecules enter the decelerator. This has 12 stages,
each comprising a pair of 20 mm-long stainless steel rods
parallel to the beam axis z and rounded to have hemi-
spherical ends. The rods are 6 mm in diameter, with
a 2 mm gap between them, as indicated on the left of
ﬁg. 1(b). The stages are separated from each other by
10 mm gaps. They are arranged in four groups of three,
alternating between vertical (y) and horizontal (x) orien-
tation, as illustrated in ﬁg. 1(a). Finally, a 552 nm probe
laser, 258 mm from the end of the decelerator and perpen-
dicular to the molecular beam, selectively excites one hy-
perﬁne sub-level of the ground state. The time-evolution
of the ﬂuorescence is detected by a photomultiplier.

The decelerator electrodes are operated at ±10 kV, giv-
ing an electric ﬁeld on the axis of nearly 100 kV/cm at the
center of each stage. Fig. 1(b) shows the resulting Stark
shift of the molecules in a vertical stage versus transverse
position x or y. This potential focusses the molecules
toward the beam axis in the x-direction and defocusses
then along y. It is approximately harmonic over most of
the region between the electrodes. The transverse mo-
tion can therefore be described using transfer matrices
(as in optics), and the transverse oscillations are stable
provided −2 <Tr(M)< 2, where M is the transfer matrix
for one unit of the periodic structure [7]. We have cho-
sen to alternate the focussing and defocussing axes after
every third lens, rather than between each lens. In this
way, we are able to maximize the number of deceleration
stages per unit length and still satisfy the alternating

gradient stability criterion.

Fig. 1(c) shows the variation of the Stark shift along
the beam axis through one stage. As the beam pulse
passes through the stage the voltages are switched on
and oﬀ by fast high-voltage switches under the control of
a 50 MHz pattern generator. Fig. 1(c) illustrates where
the ﬁeld might be switched on and oﬀ to decelerate a
molecule moving to the right. The switching sequence
that decelerates a pulse of molecules through many stages
is designed so that a particular molecule, known as the
synchronous molecule, reaches the same positions within
each stage at the moments of switching on and oﬀ. The
switch-oﬀ position is described by a phase angle φ deﬁned
through the energy loss of the synchronous molecule per
stage W0 sin φ, where W0 is the maximum possible energy
loss per stage. By choosing φ < 90◦ we ensure that those
molecules running ahead of the synchronous molecule are
decelerated more, while those lagging behind are deceler-
ated less. This phase stability is important for a deceler-
ator because it allows a ﬁnite velocity group of molecules
to propagate as a bunch [13].

The dotted curve in ﬁg. 2(a) shows the YbF time-of-
ﬂight distribution with the decelerator oﬀ, using Xe car-
rier gas pre-cooled to 210 K. We deduce from this distri-
bution that the YbF pulse has a mean velocity of 298 m/s
distributed with a full width at half maximum (FWHM)
of 26 m/s, corresponding to a temperature of 2.7 K. When
the decelerator is turned on (solid line) at a phase angle of
60◦, approximately half the molecules gather into a nar-
row bunch whose speed is 287 m/s with 13 m/s FWHM.
Most of the molecules inside the bunch have been decel-

erated, although some of the slowest molecules from the
original distribution are accelerated into the bunch, as
indicated by the reduction in the number of molecules at
long arrival times when the decelerator is turned on. The
bunch will stay together as more stages of deceleration
are added to bring it to rest.

To test our understanding of the decelerator, we sim-
ulate the motion of molecules through the apparatus by
integrating the axial equation of motion using the cal-
culated potential on the axis of the beam line, which is
plotted in Fig. 1(c). For the initial velocity distribution in
the simulation, we take a beam whose temperature and
central velocity have the values derived from the dotted
data in ﬁg. 2(a). The result of this calculation, plotted in
ﬁg. 2(b), is qualitatively very similar to the experimen-
tal result, indicating that the motion of the molecules is
indeed roughly separable into axial and transverse com-
ponents and showing that we understand the basic de-
celeration process.

Fig. 2(c) shows the results obtained with the velocity
selector turned on and timed to select the central 20µs
section of the pulse. The resulting velocity distribution
remains centered on 298 m/s but now has a FWHM of
only 8.5 m/s. When the decelerator is turned on, this
entire distribution is shifted down in velocity by 10 m/s
and the time-of-ﬂight proﬁle is narrowed to 70% of its
original width because the decelerator slows down the
faster molecules in the bunch more than the slower ones.
Fig. 2(d) conﬁrms that these results are also well de-
scribed by a simple simulation of the axial motion.

We have further tested the decelerator using four other
initial speeds, chosen by varying the mass and temper-
ature of the carrier gas, with the results shown in ﬁg. 3.
In each experiment the velocity selector was used to nar-
row the velocity distribution to a FWHM in the range
9-14 m/s. This longitudinal velocity range lies within the
phase stability range of the decelerator, meaning that
the entire velocity-selected pulse can be decelerated. In
all four experiments, the phase angle is set to 60◦, corre-
sponding to a total energy loss of 46 cm−1. The measured

energy loss conﬁrms this, showing that the decelerator
works correctly over a wide range of initial speeds. All
the beams become 20-30% narrower in their time-of-ﬂight
proﬁle when the decelerator is switched on as a result of
the phase stability. The slowest beam we have produced
is shown in Fig. 3(d). Here the speed of the molecules
entering the decelerator is only 286.5 m/s and the decel-
erator reduces their energy by 7%.

The ﬁnal speed of the molecules can be adjusted by
making an appropriate choice of phase φ in the high volt-
age switching pattern, as shown by the data points in
ﬁgure 4. Here we have simply taken the peak of the de-
celerated pulse as a measure of the speed. The solid line
shows the expected change for a synchronous molecule,
corresponding to an energy loss of W0 sin φ per stage.
Crosses show the result of a numerical simulation that
takes into account the entire ensemble of molecules. The
uncertainty in these simulations is the same as the error
bars on the data. As the phase is increased toward 90◦,
the measured change of speed shows reasonable agree-
ment with the theories. Figures 2, 3 and 4 show that
this alternating gradient decelerator works well over a
wide range of operating parameters and that its deceler-

ation and phase stability properties are well understood.
Transverse conﬁnement is important for the successful
operation of the decelerator. In order to study this exper-
imentally we measured the number of molecules reaching
the detector for a range of electrode voltages and lens
lengths. Although the physical length of the electrodes
is ﬁxed, we can vary the length of time for which each lens
acts on the molecules by changing the turn-on point in
the timing sequence (ﬁg. 1(c)), keeping the turn-oﬀ point
ﬁxed. Measurements on a 590 m/s beam are shown in
Fig. 5, where we plot the total number of molecules trans-
mitted through the decelerator, normalized to the num-
ber when the decelerator is oﬀ for various lens lengths
(5(a)) and various electrode voltages (5(b)). The dot-
ted lines show the expected transmission of molecules
through our decelerator in the absence of edge eﬀects,
lens aberrations and misalignments. This was calculated
using transfer matrices, sampling over a realistic range
of initial transverse velocities and positions. At low lens
power, the calculated transmission dips below unity be-
cause the defocussing lenses are 10% stronger than the
focussing ones. At higher power, alternating gradient fo-
cussing increases the transmission. Our data follow the
expected trend, whereas the only previous study of alter-
nating gradient deceleration of molecules showed a 20-
fold shortfall in the transmission, a problem attributed
to misalignments of the electrodes [7]. By varying the
phase angle φ we can control the fraction of time that
the molecules spend in the fringe ﬁelds of the lenses and
we ﬁnd that this alters the focussing. We believe that the
fringe ﬁelds, not accounted for in the matrix model, are
the cause of the small discrepancy between theory and
experiment observed in ﬁg. 5(a). This observation un-
derlines the importance of keeping the fringe ﬁelds under

review while designing alternating gradient decelerators.

We have demonstrated that heavy ground state
molecules can be slowed down by using an alternating
gradient decelerator. The technique we have demon-
strated can be applied to a wide range of heavy polar
molecules. We have used a 12-stage decelerator operated
at a ﬁeld of 100 kV/cm with a deceleration phase angle of
60◦ to remove 7% of the kinetic energy of YbF molecules.
We were able to raise the electric ﬁeld to 140 kV/cm with-
out electric ﬁeld breakdown. At this higher ﬁeld, 110
stages would bring the molecules to rest. They could
then be coupled into an electrodynamic trap [14, 15] or
a wire trap [16], or they could be switched into a weak-
ﬁeld seeking state and stored in an electrostatic trap e.g.
a quadrupole trap [17] or chain-link trap [18]. Trapping
heavy molecules will provide a spectacular increase in the
spectroscopic resolution available, leading to new appli-
cations in metrology, quantum chemistry and fundamen-
tal physics.

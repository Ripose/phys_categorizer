Abstract. A problem to account for the direct electron-positron annihilation in
positron-hydrogen scattering above the positronium formation threshold has been
resolved within the time independent formalism. The generalization of the optical
theorem is derived for the case when an absorption potential
is present in the
Hamiltonian. With this theorem the annihilation cross section is fully determined
by scattering amplitudes. This allows us to separate out analytically the contribution
of the positronium formation from the overall annihilation cross section. The rest is
determined as the direct annihilation cross section. It is done uniformly below as well
as above the positronium formation threshold. The multichannel three-body theory for
scattering states in the presence of an imaginary absorption potential is developed in
order to compute the direct e+e− annihilation amplitude. Special attention has been
paid to an accurate deﬁnition of the coordinate part of the absorption potential as
the properly constructed zero-range potential, which corresponds to the delta-function
originated from the ﬁrst order perturbation theory. The calculated direct annihilation
cross section below the positronium formation threshold is in good agreement with
results of other authors. The direct annihilation cross section computed with the
formalism of the paper shows nonsingular behavior at the positronium formation
threshold and is in good agreement with existing data. A number of e+e− direct
annihilation cross sections and positronium formation cross sections in the energy
gap between Ps(1s) and H(n = 2) thresholds are reported. A sharp increase in the
calculated direct annihilation cross section across the resonant energy is found for all
ﬁrst S and P-wave Feshbach resonances.

1. Introduction

In positron-hydrogen collision, if the energy is higher than the positronium formation
threshold, we have two genuine diﬀerent asymptotic channels. The positron may go
away leaving the hydrogen atom behind in ground or in an excited state, or the positron
and the electron may form a positronium leaving the proton behind. This picture
gets modiﬁed if we take into account the possibility that the positron and the electron
annihilate. In case of rearrangement scattering, when the positron and the electron form
positronium in the Ps(1s) state, the positron-electron pair annihilates mostly from this
state. The lifetime of the Ps(1s) state depends on the total spin [1]. In this process, once
positronium is formed, the third particle does not aﬀect the annihilation. The direct
annihilation occurs without formation of the positronium.
In this case the positron
interacts with the electron in the ﬁeld of the proton only when all the three particles
are close to each other. Thus, the direct annihilation is a genuine three-body process.
The standard approach treats the e+e− annihilation on the basis of the perturbation
The annihilation cross section appears as a matrix element of
theory [2, 3].
the coalescence operator between scattering states, which are the solution of the
unperturbed three-body Coulomb Hamiltonian. At higher energies, this formalism have
diﬃculties. At the positronium formation threshold, the calculated annihilation cross
section becomes inﬁnite. There has been a number of attempts to improve theory and to
achieve a uniﬁed treatment of the positron annihilation and the positronium formation
[4, 5, 6]. In one approach, to make the lifetime of the e+e− pair ﬁnite, an imaginary
absorption potential is added to the positron-electron subsystem Hamiltonian [4]. ”The
loss of particles”, due to this potential, is then interpreted as the e+e− annihilation.
The standard QED formula [2, 3] for the positron annihilation cross section suggests
the coordinate part of the absorption potential to be the three-dimensional Dirac delta
function depending on the relative position vector between the positron and the electron.
Subsequently, this kind of absorption potential was used for computing the annihilation
cross section above the positronium formation threshold [5, 7, 8]. The three-dimensional
delta-function is too singular to be an ordinary potential in the Schr¨odinger equation
[9, 10, 11]. In the actual calculations in Refs. [4, 5, 7, 8] with the delta potential, this
singularity was smoothed out. Nevertheless, the mathematically sound formulation of
using the three-dimensional zero-range potentials in three-body Coulombic systems is
still needed. It is done in this paper to complete the theory.

Direct annihilation cross section above the positronium formation threshold is
subject of an extensive study [12]. In Ref. [5, 6] it was claimed that the direct process
and the annihilation after the positronium formation are inseparable and therefore the
notion of the direct annihilation above the threshold is meaningless. In contrast, the
direct cross section was deﬁned and computed successfully below and above the Ps-
formation threshold in Ref. [8]. This calculation showed no sign of the presence of any
threshold behavior in the energy dependence of the direct annihilation cross section.

This paper is devoted to continue the study of the direct annihilation within the

Multichannel Formalism for Positron-Hydrogen Scattering and Annihilation

time independent formalism introduced in [13]. In section 2 we deﬁne the scattering
solution for the e+
H Schr¨odinger equation in the presence of an absorption potential.
Subsequently, the multichannel formalism, which is needed to determine scattering and
absorption amplitudes above the positronium formation threshold, is developed.
In
section 3 we derive the generalization of the optical theorem in the presence of an
absorption potential. This optical theorem is used to separate out the annihilation after
the positronium formation cross section from the overall absorption cross section. The
remaining part is naturally the direct annihilation cross section. The correct form of
the zero-range absorption potential is introduced in section 3. Section 4 contains the
results of calculations for the direct annihilation. Section 5 concludes the paper.

Throughout the paper we use bold letters for vectors, e.g. x, and non-bold for
their magnitudes, e.g. x =
. The unit vector pointing out in the direction of the
vector y is denoted as ˆy = y/y. In the paper we work with wave-functions and their
components of the form Ψ(X, p) where X stands for the conﬁguration coordinate and
p for the momentum of the asymptotic motion. For the sake of clarity of notations and
to avoid overloading of formulae we drop very often the conﬁguration space coordinate
from the notations of wave-functions and their components leaving only the momentum
explicitly.

2. Three-body scattering formalism

In this section we apply the three-body multichannel formalism to e+

H scattering.

2.1. Three-body scattering in the presence of absorption potential

We consider the three-body problem with an additional imaginary potential which acts
between the positron and the electron. If the center of mass motion is removed, the
Hamiltonian in the Jacobi coordinate system takes the form

H = H C + igW2(x2),

Here we assign numbers 1,2 and 3 to the positron, the proton and the electron,
respectively, therefore the electric charges are expressed through the unit charge e as

The potential igW2(x2) acting between particles of the pair 2 is deﬁned such that g is
real and negative, and W2(x2) is real and non negative. In this case igW2 is a complex
absorbing potential. We do not specify the coordinate dependence of W2 yet, except of
requiring that W2 is short-ranged.

Here φ1(x1) is the hydrogen ground state wave function with the energy ǫ1, and
the incident momentum of the positron p1 is related to the energy by the condition

the term V C
in the right hand side of Eq. (6) is always conﬁned into the region
of the conﬁguration space where the hydrogen wave function φ1(x1) is not negligible.
This makes the term V C
short-range-type and hence the asymptotics (7) in the
coordinate y1 is free from the Coulomb contribution. This property holds true for all
equations we deal with in the paper.

The formula (12) suggests that the scattering amplitude can be split into the sum of
two terms

F = F 0 + igF 1,

(14)

where F 0 is exclusively due to the Coulomb interactions between the positron and
the hydrogen and igF 1 is due to the absorption potential only. Let us note, that the
immediate identiﬁcation of these amplitudes with pieces of (12) does not lead to the
consistent form of the amplitudes F k since the wave-function Ψ+ itself may be split into
two parts similarly to (14). Hence, the contribution from diﬀerent kinds of interactions
cannot be separated on the basis of equation (12). The appropriate way is to rewrite
the LSE (8) in the form of distorted wave representation [14]. To this end, let us recast
(8) into

The asymptotic analysis of equation (18) will give us the representations for amplitudes

This problem with LSE is well known in the three-body scattering theory [15, 16, 17]
and is the manifestation of the general fact that no single LSE speciﬁes the three-body
scattering wave function uniquely, if the rearrangement channel is open. The resolution
of the problem has been found by transforming LSE into the matrix equations for
the components of the wave function. Proper arranging of the interactions between
the equations, which guarantees the uniqueness of the solution, leads to the equations
known as the Faddeev three-body equations [16, 17, 18]. We adopt this formalism
to our case in the next subsection where it is proven that for the energy above the
positronium formation threshold, similar to (14), the amplitude F is given by the formula

threshold between Ps(n = 1) and H(n = 2) thresholds the Scr¨odinger equation

asymptotic form of the wave function is diﬀerent in diﬀerent asymptotic arrangements.
This is exactly that property of the three-body wave-function, which cannot be recovered
by any single LSE.

{

In order to take into account the multichannel character of the scattering problem
above the rearrangement threshold we use the formalism of Faddeev equations [18].
Since the original formalism is developed for the short range interaction, at the ﬁrst stage
we reformulate the three-body Hamiltonian in such a way that Coulomb interactions
are split into long-range and short-range parts [19]

V C
i (xi) = V l

i (xi, yi) + V s

i (xi, yi).

This splitting is made in the three-body conﬁguration space by a smooth splitting
function ζi(xi, yi) constructed such that ζi(xi, yi) = 1 if xi/x0 < (1 + yi/y0)ν and
ζi(xi, yi) = 0 if xi/x0 > (1 + yi/y0)ν for some x0 > 0, y0 > 0 and 0 < ν < 1/2. With
such a ζi the short- and long-range parts of the Coulomb potentials are deﬁned as

The Hamiltonian (1) is then transformed into

The important feature of equations (32, 33), with regard to the description of the
annihilation, is the fact that now the two-body absorption potential igW2 is incorporated
into equations in two manners. It appears in the diagonal part on the left hand side of
the equation (33) and in the coupling term on the right hand side. The diagonal terms
of the equations (32, 33) are responsible for the asymptotic conﬁgurations in channels
1 and 2, so the absorption potential in the left hand side of (33) is natural to associate
with the annihilation after positronium formation. The coupling term in (32, 33) couples
equations in the reaction volume, therefore the absorption potential in the right hand
side of (33) is the source for the direct annihilation. These associations will be put on
the solid ground in the next section.

taking asymptotics of the right hand side of (47) as y1 → ∞

what we have demonstrated above is that the nontrivial contribution into the amplitude

for evaluations made above, can be found in Ref. [20].

The formulae (51, 54) determine the ingredients of the amplitude F11 uniformly
above as well as below the rearrangement threshold of the positronium formation. It is
possible to show by preforming backwards transformations that below the Ps-formation
threshold, where the representations (14, 21, 23) are valid, the equality

holds true. It is important to note, that from the analysis of the equation (47) it follows

This means that the respective terms in the left and right hand sides of the ﬁrst equation
in the chain (57) are not identical. In fact the amplitude F 0
11 takes into account not
only the Coulomb interaction between the positron and the hydrogen, as F 0 does,
but also the possibility of e+e− annihilation after the positronium formation. That
is due to the presence of the absorption potential in the diagonal part of the equations
(48). This means that below the positronium formation threshold the annihilation
after virtual formation of the positronium is incorporated into the F 0
11 amplitude and
consequently F 1
11 is the pure direct annihilation amplitude. It is worth mentioning again,
that the formulae (51, 54) determine the amplitudes uniformly below as well as above
the positronium formation threshold, whereas it is not true for representations (21, 23).
They are valid only below the positronium formation threshold.

3. Optical theorem in the presence of absorption and annihilation cross
section

3.1. Optical theorem

The standard optical theorem for Hermitian Hamiltonians is nothing but the
manifestation of the ﬂux conservation, what is equivalent to the unitarity of the S-
matrix. The absorption potential breaks the Hermiticity and the scattering is not
unitary. The lack of unitarity is the measure of how much of the ﬂux is absorbed and
in the case of the annihilation is the way to determine the annihilation cross section.
There is extensive literature on the optical theorem but [14] is the most suitable for our
purpose. Following this approach by multiplying the SE (6) by complex conjugate wave
function Ψ+∗ and subtracting the complex conjugated SE multiplied by Ψ+ we arrive
at the equality

The positive quantity in the left hand side of (61) is the absorption cross section which

So that, the overall annihilation cross section can be computed either by the integral

The analysis made above shows that the deﬁnitions of cross sections in terms of
scattering amplitudes (64, 65) are uniform and are valid below as well as above the
rearrangement threshold of the positronium formation. Moreover, by construction, the
integrals (51, 54) involved in the deﬁnitions of the amplitudes F 0
11 have the ﬁnite
limit as g
0. This property will be used below for perturbative calculations of the
amplitudes and cross sections. At the same time the integrals in representations (62, 68)

are divergent above the positronium formation threshold if the limit g
0 is taken.
That makes these formulae not suitable for perturbative methods above the positronium
formation threshold.

3.2. Absorbing annihilation potential

In this formula r0 is the classical electron radius, c is the speed of light and v is the

annihilation is given by the integral

Here Ψ0+ is the Ψ01 solution of the e+
H scattering problem (26, 27, 28) when the
absorption potential is not taken into account. The integral in (73) is well deﬁned below
the Ps-formation threshold. In this case (72, 73) can be considered as the ﬁrst order
Ψ0+
perturbation approximation to (62), since below the rearrangement threshold Ψ+
is the well deﬁned ﬁrst order perturbation solution (Born) to (18). This observation was
used in [4] to determine the absorption potential for 2γ singlet e+e− annihilation as

Here a0 is the Bohr radius and α is the ﬁne structure constant. This potential was used in
[4] to calculate the direct annihilation cross section by solving the Lippmann-Schwinger
equation for T-matrix below the Ps-formation threshold.

The formula (73) cannot be extended for calculations above the Ps-formation
threshold since the integral diverges. One of ways to go over the Ps-formation
threshold is the use of (62) with absorption potential (74) incorporated into the
Schr¨odinger equation. This was done in papers [5, 7] where the overall annihilation
cross section σa was computed below as well as above the Ps-formation threshold
within the hypersperical close coupling technique for the time independent three-body
Schr¨odinger equation. Paper [8] represents the solution of the time-dependent three-
body Schr¨odinger equation with the absorption potential (74) below as well as above the
Ps-formation threshold. All these papers dealt with numerical solutions of respective
equations and the delta-functional singularity of the potential (74) was treated by a
certain numerical approximation. Nevertheless, the analytical status of the potential
(74) is not satisfactory. The delta-functional singularity is too strong and makes the
Hamiltonian not well deﬁned. This issue was not addressed in aforementioned papers
and we give a portion of the necessary analysis in this subsection.

The spin-averaging factor 1/4 for singlet 2γ annihilation is implied implicitly.

It is well known already since the papers by Fermi [9] and then Breit [10] that
the three-dimensional delta-function potential can be incorporated into the Schr¨odinger
equation only perturbatively. One of the approaches to go beyond the perturbative
treatment is the use of a zero-range potential [10, 11]. There are two common ways to
introduce the zero-range potential. One is imposing boundary conditions for the wave-
function at the singularity point. The other one is introducing into the Hamiltonian
an additional term, which enforces the wave-function to fulﬁll the boundary conditions.
This term can conveniently be represented in the compact form by the quasi-potential
[22, 23]. We choose the second option.

The singularity caused by the zero-range potential in the case of the electron-
e2/x2.
positron interaction is located at the same point as the Coulomb singularity
The latter leads to the modiﬁcation of the standard zero-range potential and of the
respective quasi-potential. The resulting deﬁnition for the coordinate part W2 of the
absorption potential is

Coulomb modiﬁcation, can be found in [24].

ig2µ2/¯h2. This asymptotics, as usually, determines the appropriate
where a/b =
boundary conditions, which we do not write down here explicitly. It can be shown that
the action of the quasi-potential on the function with such an asymptotics is given by
the formula

W2(x2)Ψ(x2, y2) = δ(x2)b(y2).

The latter means that the action of the quasi-potential on a function χ(x2, y2), which
is regular in the point x2 = 0, is equivalent to the delta-function

W2(x2)χ(x2, y2) = δ(x2)χ(0, y2).

This formula shows that if a matrix element of the quasi-potential is calculated between
the functions χ, ω, which are regular at x2 = 0, then the quasi-potential is equivalent
to the delta-function, i.e.

This statement justiﬁes the use of the delta-function as the coordinate part of the
absorption potential in [5, 7, 8], since the basis functions of the approaches used to
compute the matrix elements of the absorption potential are smooth. Nevertheless,
any basis of smooth functions cannot reproduce the singularity in (77) by a ﬁnite
number of terms, what always happens along the numerical solution. Hence, such a
treatment of the zero-range potential in [5, 7, 8] is approximative but, in view of the

fact a(y2) =

H
collision below the Ps-formation threshold and above the threshold in the Ore gap. The
latter is deﬁned as the interval of the energy between the Ps(1s) and H(n = 2) thresholds.
All calculations were made on the basis of an extension of the multichannel numerical
algorithm for Faddeev equations, described in details in [25], for the case of annihilation.
The algorithm uses the bipolar harmonic expansion to represent the angular dependence
of the wave-function components

the orthogonal collocation procedure. The maximum values of l1, l2 used in (81) range
from 12 to 15.

In order to test the numerical approach, the genuine Coulomb problem for e+

scattering was solved on the platform of MFE (32, 33) with g = 0. The results of
calculations for s-wave e+

shows that the diﬀerence is not so dramatic.

The extensive calculations of the direct annihilation cross section σa

1 were made in
the interval of the energy between H(n = 1) and H(n = 2) thresholds on the basis of the
formula (65). Figure 2 shows the s-wave eﬀective number Z 1

formula (82), and the results of calculations from [8]. Although, quite diﬀerent methods
(time-independent Faddeev equations and time-dependent wave-packet approach to the
Schr¨odinger equation) of calculations for the direct annihilation cross sections have been
used, the agreement between data is fairly good. In fact, the deﬁnition of the direct cross
section σa

(see equation (63)) is quite equivalent to the time-dependent deﬁnition by formula (7) of
ref. [8]. Nevertheless, as the data of Tables 4, 5 shows, the exact use of the formula (84)
would be very unpractical. The formation cross section σ21, which is the leading term of
σa

bigger than σa

the formation and direct parts made in Subsection 3.1 and given by formulae (63-65) in

direct annihilation cross section in terms of amplitudes is proven to extend the standard
formula to the energy region above the positronium formation threshold. Below the
threshold our cross section and the cross section calculated from the standard theory are
in good agreement provided the close vicinity of the positronium-formation threshold is
not considered where the standard cross section becomes inﬁnite. The direct annihilation
cross section deﬁned by the formula (65) does not exhibit any singular behavior at the
Ps-formation threshold. It is in good agreement with the nonsingular direct annihilation
cross section computed from the time-dependent solution of the three-body Schr¨odinger
equation for e+

H system [8].

The formalism of this paper can readily be extended beyond the Ore gap. In this
case the multichannel optical theorem, which generalizes (61), plays the key role in
the determination of cross sections. Preliminary calculations indicated the much larger
enhancement of the direct annihilation cross section near the Feshbach resonances in
the eight open channel region above the Ps(n = 2) threshold. Since there are numerous
resonances beyond the Ore gap, they evidently made a signiﬁcant contribution to the
overall annihilation peak around 12 e.V. displayed in Figure 2 of [8]. We hope that
our individual annihilation resonance structure will provide a new experimental tool to
study sharp resonances. Although at the present time, it is not possible to conduct such
an experiment for e+
H system, experiments for positron scattering on large molecules
have been done for many systems [34].

Our approach,

in perspective, opens the way to considering more complicated
systems with more than three particles, as for example e+e+e−e−. Suitable formalism
for multichannel scattering [35], which is the generalization of the Faddeev equations
for the four-particle systems, will be helpful as an important theoretical step towards
the experimental veriﬁcation and utilization of the rich positron annihilation physics.

It is possible to tune the scattering length for the collision of ultra-cold 1S0 ground state alkaline-earth atoms
using an optical Feshbach resonance. This is achieved with a laser far detuned from an excited molecular
level near the frequency of the atomic intercombination 1S0–3P1 transition. Simple resonant scattering theory,
illustrated by the example of 40Ca, allows an estimate of the magnitude of the effect. Unlike alkali metal species,
large changes of the scattering length are possible while atom loss remains small, because of the very narrow
line width of the molecular photoassociation transition. This raises prospects for control of atomic interactions
for a system without magnetically tunable Feshbach resonance levels.

PACS numbers: 34.50.Rk, 34.10.+x, 32.80.Pj

In recent years the ability to change the interaction be-
tween ultra-cold colliding atoms has opened the way for new
and exciting experiments with ultra-cold atomic gases. The
observation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in atomic
cesium [1] would have been impossible without the ability
to change the interaction from being attractive to being re-
pulsive. More impressively, time-varying interactions have
allowed the creation of condensates of two-atom molecules
starting from an atomic Bose condensate[2, 3]. Most recently,
the observation of the condensation of pairs of fermionic [4]
atoms has started investigations into the so-called BEC-BCS
crossover[5], where BCS is the abbreviation for the Bardeen-
Cooper-Schrieffer phase transition in a fermionic gas[6].

The key to these developments has been the ability to
change the interaction between atoms by a magnetically-tuned
Feshbach resonance [7]. Theoretical discussion of the proper-
ties of these resonances can be found in Refs. [8, 9, 10, 11].
The interaction between the atoms at ultra-cold temperature
can be characterized by a single parameter, the scattering
length[12, 13], which can be controlled in sign and magnitude
using these resonances.

Another way to change the scattering length of two collid-
ing atoms is to optically couple the ground scattering state
with an excited bound state[14]. These optical Feshbach reso-
nances are theoretically analyzed in Refs. [15, 16] and imple-
mented experimentally in Refs. [17, 18]. The recent experi-
ment of Theis et al. [18] with 87Rb atoms showed, however,
that a signiﬁcant change of the scattering length is accompa-
nied with substantial loss of atoms. The same is true if a two-
color Raman process is used [19].

In this paper we discuss the optical tuning of scattering
lengths in ultra-cold alkaline-earth atom vapors. To do so we
will assume that the laser is far detuned from excited molecu-
lar states near the intercombination transition, 1S0–3P1, as re-
cently analyzed in Ref. [20]. We show that signiﬁcant changes
of the scattering strength can be achieved without the ex-
cessive atom loss that plagues experiments with alkali-metal
gases[18]. Prospects for an optically tuned scattering length
in ultra-cold alkaline-earth vapors seems to be particularly at-
tractive, since magnetically tuned Feshbach resonances do not
occur between the isotopes of ground-state 1S0 alkaline-earth

atoms with zero nuclear spin. Several alkaline earth metal
atoms also have isotopes with nonzero integer or half-integer
nuclear spin. Optical methods could be used to tune their
scattering lengths, although we will not consider these specif-
ically in this paper. Optical Feshbach control can be also ap-
plied to other atomic systems having a similar electronic struc-
ture. The recent Bose-Einstein condensation of ytterbium [21]
makes this system especially interesting.

≈

The theoretical description of optical Feshbach resonances
and the closely related photoassociation (PA) process is well
established [14, 15, 16]. The elastic and inelastic scattering
rates due to a single photoassociation resonance level depends
on (1) the natural line width Γe,nat
2ΓA of the excited
molecular level e, (2) the stimulated width Γeg(εr) that cou-
ples the excited level to the s-wave collision of the ground
state g at relative kinetic energy εr, and (3) the detuning
∆e from optical resonance. Here, following the notation
∆
of Ref. [20] for PA near the 1S0-3P1 intercombination line of
a Group II atomic species, ΓA is the natural decay width of
the atomic transition, ∆ = ¯hω
EA, where

Ee is the energy of an isolated excited molecular bound level,
EA is the energy of the 3P1 atom, and ω is the frequency of
the light driving the transition. The stimulated width is

onance is small. Consequently, we will only consider the case

Equation (8) shows that the change in scattering length for an
optically induced Feshbach resonance has the same form as

responds to blue detuning and a positive change in scattering
length.

This length depends on the molecular physics parameters of
the ground and excited states but is independent of collision

to the laser intensity I, given our large detuning assumption.
The optical length is the same as the radius introduced in
Eq. (12) of Ref. [15].

we may take kr typical of a collision energy in the system.
Combining these criteria, they may be stated either in terms

In general it will be difﬁcult to satisfy these criteria for
the case of strongly allowed molecular transitions with large
Γe,nat since they typically have a relatively small lopt at the
large detunings that are necessary. However, using the exam-
ple of Ca atoms, we now will show that these criteria can be
satisﬁed by an intercombination line transition, for which the
needed large detuning can be achieved close enough to atomic
resonance that the Franck-Condon factor is large enough that
lopt is not too small.

ing range of the scattering length of about 200 a0 accompa-

(a0 = 0.05291772 nm). The optical length for this strongly
allowed 87Rb2 transition is lopt
100 a0, which is relatively
small and comparable to abg = 103 a0. Therefore, a signiﬁ-
cant change of the scattering length, i.e. aopt

be induced close to resonance and is accompanied by a large

We have calculated properties of optical Feshbach reso-
nances for calcium near the intercombination line. The molec-
ular structure and transition dipole moments are evaluated as
in Ref. [20]. The molecular structure is insufﬁciently known
to quantitatively predict the absolute positions of the excited
bound vibrational levels. It is necessary to measure these po-
sitions experimentally. Moreover, the background scattering
length of the ground state is not precisely known but is be-
lieved to be positive and on the order of a few hundred a0 [25].
Nevertheless, we can map out the values of lopt, aopt, and
other Feshbach properties as a function of the background
scattering length, binding energy, and laser detuning and in-
tensity.

Figure 1 shows lopt as a function of both background scat-
tering length abg and ∆e (The positive binding energy rela-
tive to 3P1+1S0 atoms is

the stimulated width Γeg(εr), necessary for the evaluation of
lopt, are described in the ﬁgure caption and Ref. [20]. Fig-

length at the maxima ranges between 10 a0 and 105 a0. The
interference minima to the right of the arrows are due to the
mixing of 0+
u and 1u bound states . The third minimum is
due to vanishing overlap between excited 0+
u and ground state
wave functions. The nature and properties of these features
are discussed in detail in Ref. [20].

The ﬁgure also shows that the envelop of lopt (i.e., ignoring
oscillations) increases when

In fact, for a laser intensity of 1 W/cm2 and binding energies

The laser detunings shown in the ﬁgure are orders of magni-

that

satisﬁed. However, for collision energies on the order of of 1
µK, Γe,nat(1 + 2krlopt) is of the same order as the frequency
range in Fig. 2 and our assumptions are broken. Consequently,
for these collision energies we need a detuning ∆

The essential molecular physics that sets the magnitude
of lopt depends on the molecular Franck-Condon factor in
Eqs. (1) and (2). The transition dipole moment cancels in the
deﬁnition of lopt in Eq. (13) due to the relation Γe,nat
2ΓA.
However, the small natural line width of the 1S0–3P1 tran-
sition for alkaline-earth atoms has an important role to play,
since much smaller detuning from atomic resonance can be
used than in the case of alkali-metal atoms. Both numeri-

cal and analytic calculations, similar to those used in the Ap-
pendix of Ref. [16], show that the magnitude of the Franck-
Condon factor (ignoring an oscillating phase factor) increases
as the binding energy of the excited level decreases. To oper-
ate at sufﬁciently large detuning to satisfy Eqs. (14) and (15)
requires a quite large binding energy for strongly allowed tran-
sitions, i.e, many GHz to more than a THz. On the other hand,
binding energies in the MHz range can be used in the case
of weak intercombination line transitions. Consequently we
ﬁnd that optical lengths can be orders of magnitude larger for
weak intercombination lines than allowed transitions, since
the Franck-Condon factors can be intrinsically much larger
once the necessary conditions are satisﬁed for changing scat-
tering length without major losses.

In summary, we have shown that molecular energy levels
close to the 1S0 +3 P1 dissociation limit of alkaline-earth
metal atoms provide optical Feshbach resonance states that al-
low for a signiﬁcant change of scattering length even for mod-
erate laser intensities and laser frequencies far detuned from
optical resonance, with a relatively small trap loss rate coefﬁ-
cient. A small loss rate coefﬁcient leads to longer observation
times. Although we have used calcium as an example system,
we expect our conclusions to remain valid for other alkaline-
earth atoms as well as atoms with similar electronic structure
like ytterbium [21]. Optical Feshbach resonances seem to be
a promising tool that will allow a tunable interaction strength
in atomic systems which do not have magnetic Feshbach res-
onances.

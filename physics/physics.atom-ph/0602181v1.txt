Cold inelastic collisions of atoms or molecules are analyzed using very general arguments. In free
space, the deactivation rate can be enhanced or suppressed together with the scattering length of the
corresponding elastic collision via a Feshbach resonance, and by interference of deactivation of the
closed and open channels. In reduced dimensional geometries, the deactivation rate decreases with
decreasing collision energy and does not increase with resonant elastic scattering length. This has
broad implications; e.g., stabilization of molecules in a strongly conﬁning two-dimensional optical
lattice, since collisional decay of the highly vibrationally excited states due to inelastic collisions is
suppressed. The relation of our results with those based on the Lieb-Liniger model are addressed.

Feshbach resonances [1, 2] have been used to control
atomic interactions in trapped ultracold quantum gases
by tuning a magnetic ﬁeld near a diatomic molecule Fes-
hbach resonance to convert atoms into weakly bound
molecules. For fermionic atoms the molecules formed
were remarkably long-lived [3], whereas for bosonic atoms
in a BEC [4], collisional decay of the highly excited vibra-
tional molecular state occurs [5] and only a small fraction
of molecules is observed in this case.

Here we show, using general scattering theory argu-
ments, that inelastic ultra-cold collisions in reduced di-
mension can be strongly suppressed. This generalizes the
work of Ref. [6], which uses the exactly solvable Lieb-
Liniger many-body model for indistinguishable bosons in
one-dimension (1D) [7], to all kinds of quasi-1D scatter-
ing processes occurring in atomic waveguides, e.g., colli-
sions of atoms and molecules. Quasi-1D scattering occurs
in a gas in the presence of a waveguide potential that con-
ﬁnes a 3D gas suﬃciently tightly in two directions so the
radial conﬁnement energy ω⊥ (in units where ¯h = 1) is
much larger than the collision energy [8], as in 2D optical
lattices [9], elongated atomic traps [10], and atomic in-
tegrated optics devices [11]. This suppression has broad
implications, e.g., it can be used to stabilize molecules
produced from bosonic atoms in tight atomic waveg-
uides, since vibrational-to-translational energy-transfer
collision rates are signiﬁcantly reduced relative to the
3D rates at low collision energy. Suppression of inelas-
tic scattering can also occur in collisions of other excited
collision partners (e.g., in hyperﬁne excited atom colli-
sions). Long-lived excited ultracold atoms and molecules
may be useful in quantum interferometry and quantum
computation.

Low-energy inelastic exoergic collisions in the presence
of a Feshbach resonance can often be treated as multi-
channel scattering with zero-range interactions described
by boundary conditions for s-wave radial wave functions
ϕj(r) = r
ψj(r)dΩr (see [13] and references therein).

for the input channel ϕo, the closed channel ϕc, and the
deactivation product ϕd having a set of output chan-
nels
. This method is applicable to collisions of any
type of particles when s-wave scattering is allowed. Note
that broad Feshbach molecules [14] cannot be treated us-
ing the zero-range approach of Eq. (2). However, if one
is considering atom-molecule or molecule-molecule colli-
sions, the resonance does not coincide with the resonance
in atom-atom collisions, e.g., two resonances in collisions
of Cs2 molecules have been observed at 12.72 and 13.15
G [15], far oﬀ the atom-atom resonance at 19.84 G.

The theoretical framework for calculating atom-diatom
scattering can be drawn along the lines of the Arthurs

When the coupling of the input channel to the other
channels vanishes, Eq. (2) reduces to the Bethe-Peierls

Consider now collisions in a transverse harmonic
waveguide. This problem has been analyzed in Refs. [8,
17] for a single-channel Huang pseudopotential, which is
equivalent to the boundary condition in Eq. (3). The
case of a multichannel δ-function interaction has been
considered in Ref. [16] using a renormalization procedure.

deactivation under conﬁnement does not have resonances
and can be strongly suppressed even compared to the
non-resonant process in free space. Suppression appears
also at E = (2k + 1)ω⊥, where excitations of transverse
waveguide modes become open, leading to jumps in the
elastic scattering amplitude [16, 19].

The above results are obtained for a system composed
of two arbitrary types of particles interacting via s-wave
scattering. A suppression of inelastic collision has been
predicted in Ref. [6] for a many-body system of 1D in-
distinguishable bosons using the Lieb-Liniger model [7].
However, as we shall see below, the suppression is mostly
a two-body interaction eﬀect even in this model.

Consider ﬁrst the two-body scattering process with
particle momenta p1 and p2. The Lieb-Liniger wave func-

In summary,

inelastic collision rates in free space
demonstrate resonances and dips, being proportional to
2, and are capped by (18). Interference of deactiva-

tion of the open and closed channels can also suppress the
rate. In quasi-1D scattering at low collision energies [see
Eq. (24)], inelastic collisions do not have resonances and
are suppressed. This result applies to the collision of any
type of atoms or molecules interacting via s-waves and is
not based upon the 1D Bose gas Lieb-Liniger model.

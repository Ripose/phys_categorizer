In a two level atom, real-time quantum state holography is performed through

interferenes between quantum states reated by a referene pulse and a hirped

pulse resulting in oherent transients. A sequene of several measurements allows

one to measure the real and imaginary parts of the exited state wave funtion.

These measurements are performed during the interation with the ultrashort laser

pulse. The extreme sensitivity of this method to the pulse shape provides a tool for

eletri (cid:28)eld measurement.

INTRODUCTION

The e(cid:27)et of laser pulse shape on a quantum system is related to the nature of the inter-

ation. For a linear response of the system (one-photon transition in the weak (cid:28)eld regime),

the (cid:28)nal outome depends only on the spetral omponent at the resonane frequeny and

is therefore independent of the pulse shape, and partiularly of the spetral phase [1℄. This

explains for instane why signals equivalent to wave-paket interferenes ould be observed

with inoherent light as well as with ultrashort pulses [2℄. However, the temporal evolution

towards the (cid:28)nal state may depend strongly on the pulse shape. A straightforward illustra-

tion of this statement is the non-resonant interation whih leads to transient exitation of

the system, but to no (cid:28)nal exitation. In the absene of predesigned ontrol mehanisms

only a losed loop sheme [3, 4℄ may be employed to (cid:28)nd e(cid:30)ient pulse shapes [5, 6, 7, 8℄ :

The outome of many di(cid:27)erent shapes is fed bak into an algorithm that iteratively opti-

mizes the exitation shape without insight into the physial mehanism that is triggered by

a partiular shape.

In ontrast the e(cid:27)et of shapes on small systems an be systematially studied within an

open-loop sheme [9, 10, 11, 12℄. This open-loop approah is well adapted to these systems for

whih theoretial preditions are reliable. It onsists of reahing a spei(cid:28) goal (manipulation

bak. Physial analysis of the proess allows one to predetermine the theoretial pulse shape

whih leads to the desired result. It is then implemented experimentally.

In this artile, we desribe manipulation of Coherent Transients (CT) in an open loop

approah. These CT are osillations in the exited state population resulting from the inter-

ation between a two-level system and a weak hirped pulse. The shape of these osillations

is extremely sensitive to slight hanges in the pulse shape [12, 13℄. Two previous letters

[14, 15℄ have shown that their high sensitivity provides a new sheme for quantum state

measurement and eletri (cid:28)eld reonstrution. This artile presents in details the works and

alulations orresponding to these results. First we reall the oherent transients and how

to manipulate them. Then the quantum state measurement reonstrution is presented in

detail. In partiular several shemes are disussed. Then the experimental set-up and several

previous feasibility test are desribed. Finally the results are presented and disussed.

as already demonstrated [12, 16℄ (f Fig. 2). These strong osillations result from interferenes

the omplex plane.

The CT phenomenon is better understood by examining the behavior of ae (t) in the

omplex plane as displayed in the inset of Fig. 2. The probability amplitude follows a Cornu

4

spiral starting from the origin. Three regions an be distinguished. The two spirals result

from ontributions before (I) and after (III) resonane for whih the quadrati phase varies

rapidly. The intermediate region (II) orresponds to the passage through resonane where the

phase is stationary. It provides the main ontribution to the population. The two spirals,

although similar, result in totally di(cid:27)erent behaviors of the population. The (cid:28)rst one (I)

winds round the origin with an inreasing radius. The resulting probability inreases thus

slowly and regularly and remains small. After resonane (III), a seond spiral winds round

the asymptoti value leading to strong osillations of the population.

We show in the next setion how a modi(cid:28)ation of the exitation sheme provides the

possibility to observe osillations due to the (cid:28)rst part of the pulse.

III. QUANTUM STATE MEASUREMENTS

A. priniple

The CTs are extremely sensitive to tiny phase modi(cid:28)ations of the pump pulse [12, 13℄.

Therefore, they an provide detailed information on the exiting pulse and simultaneously

on the exited quantum state. However, although sensitive to phase e(cid:27)ets these CTs give

aess to the exited state probability |

ae(τ )

2

|

whereas the probability amplitude is neessary

to ahieve a omplete measurement of the eletri (cid:28)eld. Moreover, the osillations are only

produed by the seond part of the pulse (after resonane)[16℄. To overome these limitations,

we propose a new exitation sheme based on a two pulse sequene with a well de(cid:28)ned phase

relationship. The pump pulse is written as

Epu(t) = Epu1(t) + eiθEpu2(t)

(3)

where Epu1(t) and Epu2(t) are two replia of the initial pulse with additional spetral phase.

These an be obtained with either a Mihelson-type interferometer or a pulse shaper. The

(cid:28)rst pulse Epu1(t) reates an initial population in the exited state. The seond pulse Epu2(t)

is strongly hirped and su(cid:30)iently delayed so that it does not overlap with the (cid:28)rst pulse.

This seond pulse reates a probability amplitude in the exited state whih interferes with

the initial probability amplitude reated by the (cid:28)rst pulse.

It should be noted that the details of the shape of the (cid:28)rst pulse are not ritial. Only

the (cid:28)nal state reahed at the end of the (cid:28)rst pulse is involved in the temporal evolution of

the system during the seond pulse.

Looking at the evolution of the quantum state in the omplex plane (Fig. 3 (b)), one sees

that the e(cid:27)et of the (cid:28)rst pulse is to shift the starting point of the spiral so that osillations

due to CTs our on the whole duration of the seond pulse. Assuming a su(cid:30)ient time

interval between the two pulses to avoid any overlap, the probability amplitude indued by

the (cid:28)rst pulse ae1(t) has reahed its asymptoti value ae1(

) when the interation with the

∞

seond pulse starts. For a probe pulse signi(cid:28)antly shorter than the details one wants to

retrieve on the exited state population, the reorded (cid:29)uoresene S θ(τ ) is diretly propor-

tional to the exited state population. During (or after) the seond pulse, it an be written

B. Reonstrution tehniques

The probability amplitude produed by the seond pulse Epu2(t) is retrieved by ombining
the CTs sans S θ(τ ) (see Eq. 4) obtained for di(cid:27)erent values of the programmable phase

the (cid:28)rst pulse. We will show here di(cid:27)erent possible reonstrution shemes. As an example,

we simulate the CTs orresponding to the following two-pulse sequene : the (cid:28)rst pulse is

100 fs long, the seond one is hirped to 10 ps (2.105

2

fs

quadrati phase) and delayed by

6 or 10 ps. Both pulses are resonant ωpu = ωeg and have the same energy. Determining the

real and imaginary part of the probability amplitude requires at least two equations, whih

means two CT sans with di(cid:27)erent values of θ. In this ase, a system of two seond order

equations is obtained. A geometri method is used to solve it. With a third measurement,

the quadrati term in Eq. 4 an be removed in order to obtain a linear system.

With a set of three sans, the angles θk(k = 0, 2) must be hosen so that the orresponding

matrix is not singular. This is the ase for instane with θk = 2kπ/3. The orresponding

CTs are plotted in Fig. 4. From these measurements, we alulate S [3](τ ) de(cid:28)ned as :

If the seond pulse is muh weaker than the (cid:28)rst one, the quadrati term in |

solution and α = π/2 is the simplest hoie.

Generally, the non-linear equation system gives two di(cid:27)erent solutions and only one is

physially aeptable. To easily identify this solution and separate it from the other one, we

have developed a geometri reonstrution whih is desribed in detail in the appendix.

The experimental set-up is displayed in Fig. 5. The 5s - 5p (P1/2 ) transition (at 795

nm) is resonantly exited with a pulse sequene. The transient exited state population is

probed "in real time" on the (5p - (8s, 6d)) transitions with an ultrashort pulse (at 607

nm). The laser system is based on a onventional Ti : Sapphire laser with hirped pulse

ampli(cid:28)ation (Spit(cid:28)re Spetra Physis) whih supplies 1 mJ -130 fs -795 nm pulses. Half

of the beam is used for the pump pulse. The remaining seeds a home made Non-ollinear

Optial Parametri Ampli(cid:28)er (NOPA) ompressed using double pass silia prisms, whih

delivers pulses of a few miroJoule, 30 fs -FWHM pulse intensity, entered around 607 nm.

The pump pulse is shaped with a programmable pulse-shaping devie produing the pulse

6
8

sequene, reombined with the probe pulse and sent into a sealed rubidium ell. The pump-

probe signal is deteted by monitoring the (cid:29)uoresene at 420 nm due to the radiative asade

(8s, 6d) - 6p - 5s olleted by a photomultiplier tube as a funtion of the pump-probe delay.

In parallel, a ross-orrelation of the pump pulse sequene is reorded. The pulse shaping

devie is a 4f set-up omposed of one pair eah of re(cid:29)etive gratings and ylindrial mirrors.

Its ative elements -two 640 pixels liquid rystal masks- are installed in the ommon foal

plane of both mirrors. This provides high resolution pulse shaping in phase and amplitude

[17℄. This is used to generate the shaped pump pulse sequene by applying the funtion

Interferometri stability

The relative stability of the two pulse sequene is a ruial point in the present experiment.

Both the relative phase and delay between the two pulses of the pump sequene should be

kept stable as ompared to 2π or to the optial period To . Experiments of wave paket

interferenes have been performed with a Mihelson interferometer used to produe the

pulse pair. The delay was either atively [18, 19, 20℄ or passively [21, 22, 23, 24, 25℄ stabilized

using di(cid:27)erent tehniques. The best ahieved stability is better than To/100 with a Mihelson

plaed under vauum [25℄.

Alternatively, in experiments where only the amplitude of the interferene pattern is

needed, di(cid:27)erent strategies have been developed. These are based either on periodi modu-

lation of the delay followed by a lok-in ampli(cid:28)er [26, 27℄, or random (cid:29)utuations applied to

the delay followed by measurement of the resulting noise [28, 29, 30℄.

In our approah, the required stability and ontrol of the phase and delay are naturally

provided by the phase and amplitude pulse shaper [17℄. As an illustration, we have performed

demonstration experiments with a pump sequene onsisting of two idential Fourier trans-

form limited pulses, delayed by 3 ps. In a (cid:28)rst example (see Fig. 6), the relative phase (at the

resonane frequeny) is set to 0 and π for two sans of the pump - probe delay. Two ross-

orrelations measurements (Fig. 6a and b) illustrate the relative position of the pulses. The

phase shift of π does not a(cid:27)et these ross-orrelations. In the pump-probe san, the three

positions of the probe pulse with respet to the pump sequene lead to : (i) No (cid:29)uoresene

signal when the probe is before the pump pulses, (ii) a onstant signal independent of the

relative phase for the probe before the pump pulses, (iii) onstrutive (θ = 0) or destru-

tive (θ = π) interferenes for a probe pulse after the pump sequene. In the onstrutive

interferene ase, the (cid:29)uoresene signal is 4 times the signal obtained with a single pulse,

as expeted from usual interferenes.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We present a series of results obtained with a sequene of two pulses generated by the

high resolution phase and amplitude pulse shaper : The (cid:28)rst one is lose to Fourier limited

(a replia of the input pulse) and the seond one is time delayed (φ(1)
hirped (φ(2)

2.105 fs2

pu =

pu = 6 ps) and strongly

). Their amplitude are set equal. With phase and amplitude shap-

−

ing, an extra relative phase θ an easily be added to the seond pulse. The various reords

orrespond to di(cid:27)erent values of θ and are used to illustrate the two reonstrution methods

desribed in Setion III B.

In the (cid:28)rst example, three sans with phases separated by 2π/3 are used : θ = θ0 +

2kπ/3 (k = 0, 1, 2). The quality of the reonstrution does not depend on θ0 and here we
have θ0 ≃

0.7 (the reonstrution e(cid:30)ieny does not depend on θ0 ). The sans are displayed

in Fig. 8-a. As a di(cid:27)erene to the ase of a single hirped pulse (Fig. 2) [16℄, the three

regimes are now learly visible. The osillations are observed before resonane as well as

after resonane. The behavior during the passage through resonane depends diretly on the

relative phase θ. A rapid inrease, slow inrease or slow derease is observed resulting from

onstrutive, partially onstrutive or destrutive interferenes. As expeted, and similarly

to the ase of two FT limited pulses (see Fig. 6 and 7), the asymptoti value depends also

strongly on θ. The linear reonstrution method is used. The good stabilities of the laser

and experimental set-up allow us using diretly the raw data without any adjustment. The

exited state probability amplitude produed by the seond pulse (with θ = θ0 ) is extrated

from the three measurements and displayed in Fig.8-b). One observes learly the expeted

Cornu spiral.

two measurements is displayed in Fig. 9b. The reonstruted probability amplitude is also

displayed in Fig. 10 in a 3D plot (real and imaginary part of the probability amplitude as a

funtion of time). The pro jetions on the various 2D planes are also displayed. The expeted

Cornu spiral [16℄ is learly seen in the omplex plane.

In previous experiments [12, 16℄, only the exited state probability was measured. Here,

The two methods provide similar quality of reonstrution. The linear approah requires

three measurements. It inreases the reording time by a fator of 1.5 as ompared to the

nonlinear method. Conversely it is more robust and an be used in a wider variety of situ-

ations (relative phase, intensity ...). A larger number of reordings ould be ombined in a

linear square (cid:28)t approah to improve the auray of the measurement. This would of ourse

be at the extent of the reording time.

Several examples of quantum phase measurements of states reated by ultrashort pulses

are based on interferenes between an unknown wave funtion and a (cid:17)referene(cid:17) wave fun-

tion. These wave funtions are reated by a sequene of two ultrashort pulses (an unknown

pulse and a referene pulse). The quantum state reated by the unknown pulse is dedued

either by time- and frequeny- integrated (cid:29)uoresene measured as a funtion of the delay

[31℄, or by measuring the population of eah eigenstate for di(cid:27)erent values of the relative

phases [32℄. Alternatively, the amplitude of noise resulting from random (cid:29)utuations of the

delay is measured [30, 33℄. In another approah, the dispersed (cid:29)uoresene emitted by an

osillating nulear wave paket in a diatomi moleule was reorded as a funtion of time

[34℄. In this ase, the (cid:29)uoresene wavelength - position relationship is derived from the

Frank-Condon priniple.

In all these examples involving several exited states, either a partiular seletivity is

used to detet independently eah exited state, or the delay is used to obtain a set of

measurements whih are then inverted to obtain the amplitude of eah quantum state. In

our study, only one single exited state is involved and the measurements are performed at

the same delay. This ensures determining the temporal evolution of the quantum state.

Our quantum state measurement method an be extended to the ase of p exited states
)i=1,p of di(cid:27)erent energies ~ωi . Their probability amplitudes an be retrieved from a set of

|
2p+1 measurements in a linear reonstrution sheme. As an example, the (cid:28)rst measurement

|

This allows thus to remove the nonlinear ontributions from the subsequent measurements.

The remaining 2p measurements are performed with the two pulse sequene, eah with a

set of p phases (θi,k)i=1,p for k = 1, 2p applied at the frequenies ωi . They provide with the

VI. CONCLUSION

We have presented a new method to determine the real time evolution of an exited

quantum state in interation with an ultrashort laser pulse.

By simple derivation of the exited state probability amplitude, it is possible to retrieve

the eletri (cid:28)eld (phase and amplitude) of the seond pump pulse Epu2(t), provided that

the probe pulse is well known or short enough. The possibilities o(cid:27)ered by this tehnique

are disussed in detail elsewhere [14℄. It an also be used for a di(cid:27)erential measurement to

analyze the hanges indued by inserting a material. In this last ase, the requirements on

the properties of the probe pulse are less severe.

We thank Chris Meier for fruitful disussions.

VII. APPENDIX

We detail here the geometrial reonstrution used to solve the set of seond-order non-

linear equations. This latter interprets the equation system (6) in terms of irles intersetion

in the omplex plane. Figure 3 (a) shows the two CTs sans for θ = 0 (blak) and θ = α (gray)

used for the reonstrution (in the simulations α = π/3). The orresponding probability

amplitudes are plotted in Fig. 3 (b). In both ases, the ontribution of the (cid:28)rst Fourier-

limited pulse is a straight line and the ontribution of the seond pulse is a Cornu spiral.

The phase θ only hanges the relative orientation of the line and the spiral. At any time τ ,

the CTs values S 0(τ ) and S α(τ ) respetively orrespond to r2

0(τ ) and r2

α(τ ), where r0(τ ) and

rα(τ ) are the distanes in the omplex plane between the origin and the urrent positions on

both spirals (see Fig. 3 (b)). Retrieving the probability amplitude produed by the seond

pulse orresponds to geometrially reonstruting the blak Cornu Spiral in Fig. 3 (b), using

the two time dependant distanes r0(τ ) and rα(τ ).

To ahieve this, we mentally rotate the gray path by an angle of −

α, around the starting

point of the Cornu Spiral (1,0). We then hoose this point as the new origin for the omplex

plane. These transformations preserve both angles and distanes and therefore do not hange

15

our equation system. Figure 11 shows the two paths after the transformations. We all

P0 and Pα the starting points of eah path whose oordinates are known : (

1, 0) and

−

cos(α), sin(α)) respetively. Thanks to these transformations, the two Cornu Spirals are

(

−

now superimposed and orrespond to the amplitude probability we want to retrieve. The

two distanes r0(τ ) and rα(τ ) an now be seen as the distanes between the point ae2(τ ) on

the Cornu spiral and two referene points P0 and Pα . To geometrially reonstrut ae2(τ )

Fig. 11 (cid:21) New geometri interpretation : r0(τ ) and rα(τ ) are the distanes between ae2(τ )

and two referene points P0 et Pα .

one just needs to (cid:28)nd, for every time τ , the intersetion of the irle C0 (entered on P0
with a radius r0(τ )) and the irle Cα (entered on Pα with a radius rα(τ )), as depited in
(cid:28)gure 12. We get two di(cid:27)erent solutions, a+

Two ways of pushing the spiral away from (P0, Pα) are inreasing the intensity of the (cid:28)rst

pulse, and reduing the angle α. However, a too small angle leads to near-degeneray of the

irles, inreasing thus the unertainties in determining their rossing points. Usually, the

reonstrution works well with a (cid:28)rst pulse at least as intense as the seond one and an

angle α in the interval [π/4, π/2].

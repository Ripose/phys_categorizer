The inﬂuence of electron-electron Coulomb repulsion on nonsequential double ionization of rare-
gas atoms is investigated. Several variants of the quantum-mechanical transition amplitude are eval-
uated that diﬀer by the form of the inelastic electron-ion rescattering and whether or not Coulomb
repulsion between the two electrons in the ﬁnal state is included. Our calculations support the
conjecture that, for small transverse momentum, ﬁnal-state Coulomb repulsion has been observed
in recent experiments. Moreover, for high laser intensity, an entirely classical model is formulated
that simulates the rescattering scenario.

Multiple ionization of atoms by intense laser ﬁelds
can proceed via diﬀerent quantum-mechanical pathways.
The atom or ion may be ionized step by step such that the
transition amplitude is the product of the amplitudes for
single ionization. If such a factorization is not possible,
one speaks of nonsequential multiple ionization. Diﬀer-
ent physical mechanisms may be envisioned to underlie
the latter, but electron-electron correlation is a necessary
precondition.

The actual presence of the nonsequential double ion-
ization (NSDI) pathway was inferred long ago [1] from
data at 1053 nm at rather low intensity, but the mech-
anism responsible for it could only be identiﬁed af-
ter the cold-target recoil-ion momentum spectroscopy
(COLTRIMS) technique (also referred to as the reac-
tion microscope) provided much more detailed informa-
tion about the process than was available before [2]. In
principle, COLTRIMS is capable of analyzing double ion-
ization in terms of all six momentum components of two
particles of opposite charge, that is, the ion and one elec-
tron, while earlier experiments were only able to yield
total double-ionization rates. To the extent that the pho-
ton momentum can be neglected (this is well justiﬁed
for the near-infrared lasers used in these experiments),
this is synonymous with a complete kinematical charac-
terization of the process. As a result, rescattering has
emerged as the dominant mechanism. This puts NSDI
in the same category as other rescattering-induced pro-
cesses such as high-order harmonic generation and high-
order above-threshold ionization [3]. For a recent review
of the new developments, see Ref. [4].

An exact description of NSDI is, in practice, only pos-
sible for helium and requires the solution of the six-
dimensional time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation [5, 6].
Various approximations and models have been consid-
ered, in particular, one spatial dimension for each elec-
tron [7, 8, 9], or neglecting the backaction of the outer
electron on the inner [10], or density-functional meth-

ods [11]. Classical-trajectory Monte Carlo calculations
[12] yield reasonable agreement with the data where ap-
plicable, that is, far above the threshold. The exact
quantum-mechanical transition amplitude can be ana-
lyzed in terms of Feynman diagrams [13], and individ-
ual Feynman diagrams lend themselves to an interpreta-
tion in terms of particular physical processes. The basic
diagram that contains rescattering has been evaluated
by several groups [14, 15, 16]. This basic diagram in-
corporates (i) tunneling of the ﬁrst electron and (ii) its
subsequent motion in the laser ﬁeld, (iii) the inelastic-
rescattering collision with the second (up to this time
still bound) electron, and (iv) the propagation of the ﬁ-
nal two electrons in the laser ﬁeld. It does not contain,
for example, the interaction of the electron in the inter-
mediate state with the ion nor the interaction of the ﬁnal
electrons with the ion or with each other.

In this Letter, we incorporate the electron-electron
Coulomb repulsion in the ﬁnal state into the basic
quantum-mechanical transition amplitude of NSDI. We
will ﬁnd that this repulsion is reﬂected in recent ex-
perimental data for very small transverse electronic mo-
menta. Moreover, we formulate and evaluate a classical
inelastic-rescattering model that turns out to reproduce
the quantum-mechanical results for high laser intensity.
The quantum-mechanical transition amplitude that
formalizes the assumptions of the rescattering model is

which, for the contact and Coulomb potentials that we
consider, can be obtained in closed form. The remaining
integrals over the intermediate-state momentum k, the
ionization time t′, and the rescattering time t are eval-
uated by saddle-point integration, which is justiﬁed for
the high ponderomotive energies UP of the experiments.
The standard saddle-point approximation reduces the
ﬁve-dimensional integration to a sum over the complex
solutions ks, ts, t′
s (s = 1, 2, . . . ) of the saddle-point equa-
tions. The transition amplitude

is the coherent superposition of the contributions of all
saddle points. Here, the various exponentials in the am-
plitude (1) have been collected into the action Sp(t, t′, k).
The method is explained in detail in Refs. [17, 19]. In
rescattering problems, the complex solutions tend to
come in pairs that approach each other very closely near
the classical cutoﬀs. In this case, the standard saddle-
point approximation becomes inapplicable. We here em-
ploy a so-called uniform approximation [19, 20], which
invokes the same information on the saddles but works
regardless of their separation (it reduces to the stan-
dard approximation when the saddles are suﬃciently far
apart) [21].

Both in the saddle-point and in the uniform approx-
imation, the upshot of employing the correlated two-
electron Volkov state (2) is very simple: the result of
the uncorrelated two-electron Volkov state just has to be
augmented by the factor 2πγ/[exp(2πγ) − 1] [22].

The consequences are illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 for
the cases where V12 is the contact interaction or the
Coulomb interaction, respectively. We follow the pre-
sentation of the experimental data and decompose the
ﬁnal-state momenta into their components parallel and
perpendicular to the (linearly polarized) laser ﬁeld, so
that pi ≡ (pik, pi⊥) (i = 1, 2). Then, we present density
plots of the double-ionization probability as a function of
the parallel components p1k and p2k, while the perpendic-
ular components pi⊥ are partially or entirely integrated
over.

The ﬁnal-state Coulomb repulsion has a large eﬀect
if one of the transverse momenta is restricted to small
values [Figs. 2(e,f) and 3(e,f)], while there is virtually no
eﬀect when these values are large [Figs. 2(c,d) and 3(c,d)].
When both transverse momenta are entirely integrated
over [Figs. 2(a,b) and 3(a,b)], the eﬀect is moderate but
clearly present: the momentum density along the p1k =
p2k diagonal is slightly reduced and peaks away from it.
Remarkably, if one transverse momentum is restricted

neling ionization, whereas the second electron remains
bound. Subsequently, the ﬁrst electron propagates in the
continuum described by the Volkov time evolution opera-
tor U (V)
(t, t′), gaining energy from the ﬁeld. At the later
time t, it dislodges the second electron in an inelastic col-
lision mediated by the interaction V12, which is accounted
for in the lowest-order Born approximation. Throughout
the paper, we compare two possible choices for this in-
teraction: the Coulomb interaction V12 ∼ |r1 − r2|−1 and
a three-body contact interaction V12 ∼ δ(r1 − r2)δ(r1).
The latter has to be interpreted as an eﬀective electron-
electron interaction on the background of the ion. For
the ﬁnal two-electron state |ψ(V)
p1p2 (t)i with asymptotic
momenta p1 and p2, we take the correlated (outgoing)
two-electron Volkov state [18]

p1p2(t)i = |ψ(V)

p = (p1 − p2)/2, r = r1 − r2, and γ = 1/(2|p|) (Coulomb

In order to evaluate the multiple integrals in the tran-
sition amplitude (1), we expand the Volkov propagator

FIG. 2: Comparison of the double-ionization probability
densities with (right-hand column) and without (left-hand
column) electron-electron repulsion in the ﬁnal state as a
function of the electron momenta parallel to the laser ﬁeld.
The ﬁeld parameters are for a Ti:Sa laser with frequency
ω = 0.0551 a.u. and an intensity of 5.14 × 1014 Wcm−2 (pon-
deromotive energy UP = 1.2 a.u). The atomic parameters
correspond to neon (E01 = 0.9 a.u., E02 = 1.51 a.u.). The
electron-electron interaction V12 is speciﬁed by the three-body
contact interaction. For all panels, the transverse momentum
of one of the electrons is integrated over. The other one is
integrated, too [(a) and (b)], restricted to |p|2⊥/
Up ≥ 1.5

[(c) and (d)], or restricted to 0 ≤ |p|2⊥/

to large values [(c) and (d)], there is little qualitative
diﬀerence between the momentum distributions for the
contact and the Coulomb interaction: both are strongly
concentrated on the diagonal, but in the latter case their
center is situated at smaller momenta than in the former.

Comparing our results with the available experimental
data, we observe that the pi⊥-integrated momentum cor-
relation in neon [23] is quite well reproduced by Fig. 2(a).
Notice that this is the very simplest model, with the con-
tact interaction and no ﬁnal-state repulsion. In argon,
experimental data exist where the transverse momentum
of one of the electrons is restricted [24, 25]. Here, going
from small to large transverse momenta we ﬁnd parallel
trends in the data and in Figs. 2(d) and (f) and 3(d) and
(f) [26]. In particular, the experimental distributions of
Fig. 1(a) and (b) of Ref. [25] for argon are qualitatively
similar to Fig. 2(f), while they are clearly at variance with

FIG. 3: Same as Fig. 2, but with V12 speciﬁed by the Coulomb
interaction.

Fig. 3(f). The same holds true for the data of Ref. [24].
The rescattering diagrams of Fig. 1, though fully
quantum-mechanical, stimulate a classical interpretation.
In what follows, we recast their physical content into an
entirely classical expression. First, let us enumerate the
quantum features inherent in the transition amplitude
(1): (i) the electron enters the ﬁeld via tunneling, which
is reﬂected in the fact that, in the saddle-point solution,
the ionization time t′
s (and, to a lesser degree, also ts and
ks) is complex; (ii) the contributions of the individual
saddle points are added coherently in the sum (6); (iii)
in principle, the atom can absorb an arbitrary number
of photons from the laser ﬁeld, that is, double ioniza-
tion still occurs, though at a much reduced rate, if the
maximal kinetic energy of the returning electron is less

However, we do not expect the quantum features (ii) and
(iii) to have a signiﬁcant impact on the yields of double
ionization far above the threshold and in the case where
some transverse momentum components are integrated
over.

In order to check this surmise, we consider the classical

Here, the electron appears in the continuum with zero
velocity at the time t′ at the time-dependent rate R(t′),
which describes the quantum-mechanical tunneling pro-
cess (we will take for it a simple tunneling rate [27]). For
each ionization time t′, the return times t ≡ t(t′), and
the corresponding kinetic energies Eret(t) and drift mo-
menta k(t) are calculated along the lines of the classical
simple-man model [3]. They correspond to the saddle-
point solutions ts, except that they are real [28]. The δ-
function in Eq. (7) expresses energy conservation in the
inelastic collision that sets free the second electron. The
yield (7) is zero unless the ﬁnal momenta are compati-
ble with energy conservation. Their actual distribution
is governed by the form factor |Vpk(t)|2. In Eq. (7), the
probabilities of the various orbits s = 0, 1, . . . are added
so that their contributions cannot interfere, in contrast
to the quantum-mechanical amplitude (6). In Fig. 4, we
present the result of the classical model when the per-
pendicular momentum components pi⊥ are completely
integrated over. Comparing the quantum-mechanical re-
sults of Figs. 2(a) and 3(a) with their classical analogs,
we conclude that generally the latter reproduce the for-
mer quite well. This agrees with a similar conjecture de-
rived from the comparison of one-dimensional classical-
trajectory and quantum calculations [7]. But, in detail,
the quantum distributions are slightly wider and the low-
density regions are enhanced in comparison with the clas-
sical distributions, reﬂecting the fact that the quantum
distributions extend into the classically forbidden region
[where the argument of the δ function in Eq. (7) never
vanishes].

In summary, we have investigated the eﬀects of
electron-electron repulsion in the ﬁnal two-electron state
of non-sequential double ionization. The calculations al-
low us to conclude that footprints of electron-electron
repulsion have been observed in experiments where the
transverse momentum of one of the electrons is small.
If the laser intensity is high enough, the quantum-
mechanical momentum distributions can be well repro-
duced in a purely classical model.

tke, and W. Sandner, and we are greatly indebted to E.

of an additional mechanism contributing, possibly exci-
tation of the second electron followed by tunneling [see

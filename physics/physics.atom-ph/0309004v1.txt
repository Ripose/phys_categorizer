Abstract

We explore the character of a novel set of “ﬁeld-linked” states that were predicted in [A. V.

Avdeenkov and J. L. Bohn, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 043006 (2003)]. These states exist at ultralow

temperatures in the presence of an electrostatic ﬁeld, and their properties are strongly dependent

on the ﬁeld’s strength. We clarify the nature of these quasi-bound states by constructing their wave

functions and determining their approximate quantum numbers. As the properties of ﬁeld-linked

states are strongly deﬁned by anisotropic dipolar and Stark interactions, we construct adiabatic

surfaces as functions of both the intermolecular distance and the angle that the intermolecular axis

makes with the electric ﬁeld. Within an adiabatic approximation we solve the 2-D Schr¨odinger

equation to ﬁnd bound states, whose energies correlate well with resonance features found in fully-

converged multichannel scattering calculations.

INTRODUCTION

In the modern world of physics, manipulation of quantum phenomena in atoms and

molecules forms the basis for future applications. With the development of new techniques

for cooling and trapping polar molecules, new opportunities to harness them appeared [1, 2,

3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In particular, the interactions between pairs of molecules are likely to be

susceptible to manipulation in an electric ﬁeld. This in turn may imply an ability to direct

the course of chemical reactions [10], to inﬂuence the many-body physics of degenerate Bose

or Fermi gases composed of polar molecules [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], or to manipulate quantum

bits [16].

A particularly attractive opportunity for controlling intermolecular interactions emerges

in a set of novel long-range bound states of molecular pairs [17, 18]. In the presence of an

external electric ﬁeld, the counterplay between Stark and dipole-dipole interactions generates

shallow potentials that are predicted to support bound states of two polar molecules. For

OH molecules we have estimated that the bound states do not exist at all for ﬁelds below

about 1000 V/cm [17]. Thus the ﬁeld plays an essential role in binding the molecules into an

[OH]2 dimer; we have accordingly dubbed this new kind of molecular state a “ﬁeld-linked”

state. The purpose of this communication is to further clarify the structure of ﬁeld-linked

(FL) states. Interestingly, quadrupolar interactions between metastable alkaline-earth atoms

exhibit similar states in the presence of magnetic ﬁelds [19, 20, 21].

Schematically, the FL states originate in avoided crossings between a pair of potential

energy curves: one that represents an attractive dipolar interaction converging to a high-

energy Stark threshold; and one that represents a repulsive dipolar interaction converging

to a lower-energy threshold. The characteristic size of the FL states is therefore roughly

determined by equating the dipolar energy µ2/R3 to the Stark energy µ

. Here R is the

distance between the molecules, µ is their dipole moment, and

length scale of the avoided crossing is then Rscale = (µ/

dipole moment of 1 Debye, where Rscale is measured in units of a0 (the Bohr radius) and

E
is measured in V/cm. Thus for a reasonable-sized laboratory ﬁeld of 104 V/cm, the size of

the FL state is

60a0, although extremely weakly bound states can be far larger than this.

∼

Ref. [17] described the FL states in this simple curve-crossing picture. Adiabatic potential

curves for the OH-OH interaction were constructed by expanding the relevant potential

2

into partial waves in the intermolecular coordinate. For clarity, only the lowest partial

waves, L = 0, 2 were included. While intuitively appealing, this picture is inadequate, and

indeed a partial wave expansion is inappropriate, for the following reason. The dipole-dipole

interaction can strongly couple diﬀerent values of L, with a strength on the order of

µ2/R3.

≈

At the typical scale distance Rscale, the dipole coupling exceeds the centrifugal interaction by
a ratio 2mµ2/¯h2Rscale, where m is the reduced mass of the molecular pair. For our example
= 104 V/cm, and for a light molecule (like OH) with a reduced mass

case of µ = 1 D,

m = 10, this ratio is already

100. The ratio becomes even larger in a stronger ﬁeld, or

E

≈

for a heavier molecule. Therefore L is no longer a good quantum number for the FL states,

but rather the relative orientation of the molecules is of more signiﬁcance.

Accordingly, in this paper we present a formulation of FL states in terms of potential

energy surfaces in (R, θ), where θ is the angle that the intermolecular axis makes with re-

spect to the electric ﬁeld. Within an adiabatic representation, we compute FL states as

bound states of a single surface. Qualitatively, these identify the FL states as conﬁned to a

narrow range about θ = 0, so that their motion consists primarily of vibration along the ﬁeld

axis. Additionally, we show that the binding energies predicted by this adiabatic approx-

imation agree remarkably well with resonance positions determined from fully-converged

multichannel scattering calculations.

II. MODEL

Because the FL states are generated primarily by the competition between Stark and

dipolar interactions, our model will focus almost exclusively on these two terms in the

Hamiltonian. In particular, our simplifying assumptions here are:

1) The individual molecules are assumed to be in their electronic ground states, to be

rigid rotors, and to lie in their rotational ground states. It is assumed that none of these

degrees of freedom can be excited at the large intermolecular separations and low relative

energies that we consider.

2) Each molecule is assumed to have total spin j and to have a non-Σ electronic ground

state that can support a lambda-doublet. Again, at the intermolecular separations, energies,

and ﬁelds of interest, it is assumed that j is approximately conserved. We ignore hyperﬁne

structure in the model, so that j is an integer for bosonic molecules, and a half-integer for

3

fermionic molecules. While hyperﬁne structure is well-known to be important in ultracold

collisions, it is not germane to the main discussion of dipolar interactions, and can in any

event be included in a straightforward way later.

3) The projection of each molecule’s angular momentum onto its own interatomic axis,

denoted ω, takes only the two values

j. As a point of comparison, the energy diﬀerence

between the j = 3/2,

ω

= 3/2 ground state and the j = 3/2,

ω

= 1/2 excited state of OH

|

|

|

|

is 270 K [22], so this restriction is not such a bad one.

4) We work in the limit of large electric ﬁeld, i.e., in the linear Stark regime where the

electric ﬁeld interaction dominates the lambda-doublet splitting. Thus the molecular states

are characterized by the signed quantities

ω, rather than linear combinations of ω and

ω

−

characteristic of the zero-ﬁeld limit. We will describe some eﬀects of lambda-doubling in the

following, but they will be perturbative in this limit. A readable account of molecular wave

±

±

functions in this approximation is given in Ref. [23].

5) Finally, we assume that the molecules never get close enough together for short-range

interactions such as hydrogen bonding, exchange, or chemical reactions, to contribute. In

addition, we neglect long range interactions such as dispersion and quadrupole-quadrupole

interactions, as being negligible compared to dipole-dipole interactions.

Although this model does not describe any particular molecule, it lays the groundwork

for constructing FL states for any desired molecule. To keep the magnitudes of observable

quantities realistic in the following, we use as model parameters the dipole moment (1.68
D), lambda- doublet splitting (0.055 cm−1), and mass (17 amu) of the OH radical.

A. Basis set

Within the simpliﬁcations outlined above, the internal state of an individual rigid-rotor

molecule is speciﬁed by three quantum numbers: j, ω, and the projection of the molecule’s

angular momentum on an appropriate external axis. to describe the Stark interaction this

axis is conveniently taken as the electric ﬁeld axis. However, to describe FL states we choose

instead to quantize this angular momentum along the intermolecular axis. This emphasizes

the dimer nature of the FL states and allows a reasonable description of how the dipole-dipole

forces act ultimately to keep the molecules from crashing into one another.

Each molecule (i = 1, 2) is thus described by a rigid rotor wave function,

where notation for the electronic wave function is suppressed, under the assumption that

it plays no role at the temperatures and electric ﬁelds of interest. Here ki and ωi are

the projections of total angular momentum j onto the intermolecular axis and onto the
molecule’s own body-frame axis, respectively. The Euler angles ˆei = (αi, βi, γi) are referred

to the intermolecular axis. We further couple the molecular spins into a total spin J:

As for the relative motion of the molecules, we wish to avoid an expansion into partial

waves, as mentioned in the Introduction. We thus consider a basis set for the complete wave

, is the only rigorously conserved quantity in the

Hamiltonian for FL states; we therefore separate it at the outset. It will aﬀect the functions

F via centrifugal energies.

In addition, the wave functions must incorporate the proper symmetry under the exchange
of identical molecules, denoted by the operator ˆP12. The symmetrized states are constructed

in Appendix A, and deﬁne a pair of quantum numbers s and x:

Finally, it is useful to consider the eﬀect of the parity operator ˆI that inverts all coor-

dinates through the system’s center-of-mass. Eigenvalues ǫ of this operator are obviously

not conserved by the electric ﬁeld, yet we can construct basis sets that are eigenfunctions
of ˆI, as is done in Appendix A. When we consider matrix elements of the electric ﬁeld and

dipole-dipole Hamiltonia, we ﬁnd that the quantity

B. Hamiltonian matrix elements

To uncover the joint motion in (R, θ) that governs the FL states, we will expand the total

wave function into the basis (7) and integrate over all other degrees of freedom to derive a

set of coupled-channel diﬀerential equations for the functions F . In this section we therefore

construct the Hamiltonian matrix elements in the “internal” basis

[17], our model Hamiltonian can be written as

(cid:17)

where Ti and H S

i are the translational kinetic energy Stark energy of each molecule, and Vµµ

is the dipole-dipole interaction.

In the following subsections we list the matrix elements of the various terms of the

Hamiltonian in the unsymmetrized basis. Transformation into the symmetrized basis set is

Solutions of the coupled-channel partial diﬀerential equations (19), subject to scattering

boundary conditions, yield both the energies and resonance widths of the FL states. To clar-

ify the nature of these states, however, we ﬁrst invoke a Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

Thus we will diagonalize the model Hamiltonian for ﬁxed values of the pair (R, θ), and seek

bound state in one of the resulting potentials. In a single adiabatic surface V adiab(R, θ), the

III. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIELD-LINKED STATES

For concreteness, we consider here a pair of bosonic molecules with j = 1, and parameters

corresponding to the OH radical, as discussed above. From the similar model in Ref. [17],

we then expect to see a small number of FL states at modest electric ﬁeld values. Our aim

in this section is to describe these states approximately in terms of the quantum numbers

in our basis set deﬁned in the previous section.

A. Adiabatic surfaces

The number of adiabatic potential surfaces is set by the number of internal states of the

molecules. (Contrast this to an expansion in partial waves, where the number of channels is,

in principle, inﬁnite.) For a pair of j = 1 molecules, the present model contains 36 channels,

hence 36 surfaces. Moreover, conservation of q implies that these 36 surfaces split into two

sets of 18 channels each. The surfaces for q = 1 and q =

1 are identical, if only the Stark

−

and dipolar interactions are included, as we assume. We ﬁnd that including the lambda-

doublet interaction leaves the q =

1 surfaces unchanged, but introduces some weak avoided

−

crossings among the q = 1 surfaces. Since lambda-doubling is a perturbation for the ﬁelds

we consider, we will ignore this small eﬀect. Hereafter we report on the q =

1 surfaces.

Additionally, the quantities ωi are conserved in the absence of lambda-doubling, meaning

that we can further classify the surfaces according to whether ω1 = ω2 or ω1 =

ω2.

Subdividing the surfaces in this way yields nine surfaces with q =

1 and ω1 = ω2,
which are of greatest interest here. Slices through these surfaces at a ﬁxed angle θ = 5◦ are

−

shown in Figure 1. Here we take the applied electric ﬁeld strength to be

= 104 V/cm.

Empirically, we ﬁnd that surfaces with even values of

To gain a better understanding of the nature of the FL states, it is useful to evaluate mean

values of the quantum numbers in our basis set. In general, the symmetry-type quantum

numbers x, s, and ǫ are badly nonconserved, and average to zero. However, the angular

momentum quantum numbers J and K typically have well-deﬁned mean values that are

useful for interpretation.

The avoided crossings that allow FL states to be supported have their origin in the fact the

the Stark interaction is diagonal in the laboratory frame (deﬁned by the ﬁeld axis), whereas

the dipolar interaction is diagonal in the rotating frame (deﬁned by the intermolecular axis).

Competition between these two symmetries generate the avoided crossings. However, in the

limit where θ

0 the two axes coincide and both interactions become diagonal in K. In

→

this case the avoided crossings become diabatic crossings, and there is a conical intersection

in the surfaces. Our description in terms of adiabatic surfaces is, therefore, incomplete. It

is however useful, as we will see in the next section. There may be interesting information

on geometrical phases inherent in the FL states; this will be a topic of future study.

B. Bound states

To complete a description of the FL states we must understand their motion in R and θ.

Each bound state is nearly doubly-degenerate with respect to reﬂection in the θ = π/2 plane.

In Figure 4 we present wave function plots of those bound states that have even reﬂection

symmetry, corresponding to the bound states listed in Table I. In this ﬁgure, (a-c) refer to

these states exhibit zero-point motion in the θ direction, and that excitations are primarily

in the R direction. We therefore label the FL states with a vibrational quantum number v.

For

= 1, a nodal line appears along the θ = 0 direction, owing to the centrifugal energy

that forces the molecules away from the electric ﬁeld axis.

In realistic laboratory circumstances, the FL states are quasi-stable, being subject to

dissociation into free molecules in lower-energy internal states [17]. Nevertheless, the adia-

batic bound states we have identiﬁed here correspond to real features of these dissociating

states. To show this, we have carried out a complete coupled-channel scattering calculation

in a laboratory-frame representation, similar to that in Ref.

[18], but without including

hyperﬁne structure. We have included partial waves up to L = 16 to ensure convergence at

the several percent level in scattering observables.

We compute the time delay for the scattering process, deﬁned as [29]

Resonance peaks appear at characteristic energies that correlate well with the binding energies as

determined from the FL adiabatic surfaces (vertical lines).

where δ is the eigenphase sum, i.e., the sum of the inverse tangents of the eigenvalues of the

scattering K-matrix. This quantity, plotted in Figure 5, exhibits peaks at energies where

resonances occur. There is also a signiﬁcant background component, arising from threshold

eﬀects, but the peaks are nevertheless visible. Also indicated are the binding energies of the

FL states as given in Table I. The good agreement between the two calculations suggests

that when FL resonances are observed in experiments, the nature of the resonant states will

be well-approximated by the wave functions determined above.

In general, resonances in ultracold polar molecule scattering will come in three varieties.

The “true” ﬁeld-linked states, like the ones that we describe here, are largely independent of

physics at small values of R. We can verify this assertion by changing the small-R boundary

conditions in our multichannel scattering calculation. The positions of the FL resonances

15

do not depend at all on these boundary conditions. However, their lifetimes can ﬂuctuate

2, since the continuum states into which they can decay do depend on

within a factor of

∼
short-range physics.

A second type of FL state appears to have components at both large and small R.

Examples of these are found for states lying below the middle threshold in Fig. 1. We ﬁnd

that their positions are relatively insensitive to the short-range boundary conditions, but

that their lifetimes vary wildly. We refer to these as “quasi-FL” states. Finally a third

category of resonance is strongly sensitive to initial conditions, both in position and width.

These are resonant states of the short-range interaction, which are expected to be numerous

in low-energy molecular collisions [30, 31].

IV. OUTLOOK

We have left out many details of molecular structure and interactions, in order to em-

phasize the basic structure of the ﬁeld-linked states. This structure is remarkably simple,

and consists primarily of a pair of molecules in relative vibrational motion along an axis

that nearly coincides with the direction of the electric ﬁeld. The number of FL states is not

large, since the forces holding them together are necessarily weak.

Signiﬁcantly, to adapt this simple picture to a particular molecular species requires only

a detailed knowledge of the structure of each molecule separately, plus some information on

long-range parameters such as dispersion coeﬃcients. In other words, realistic modeling of

experimentally probed FL states can probably be achieved using currently existing informa-

tion. This is in stark contrast with molecular collisions involving close contact between the

molecules, in which case existing potential energy surfaces are likely to be inadequate for to

describe collisions at ultralow temperatures.

APPENDIX A: SYMMETRIZED WAVE FUNCTIONS

To incorporate the eﬀects of symmetrization under the exchange ( ˆP12) and parity ( ˆI)

operations, we follow the treatment of Alexander and DePristo [27]. To this end it is

convenient to relate the Euler angles of each molecule to the electric ﬁeld axis rather than
the intermolecular axis; these Euler angles are denoted ˆeL. The symmetry operations then

perform the following functions:

ˆP12 : R

These basis functions can in turn be assembled into parity eigenfunctions. Note that ˆI

has the same eﬀect on the relative coordinates as does ˆP12, so that eiMφF

(1,2)JK is already
a parity eigenstate with eigenvalue s. Denoting the parity of the total wave function by ǫ,

the parity of the relative wavefunctions should be p = ǫs, or p = q(

−

quantum number q deﬁned in Eqn.(6). This deﬁnition seems (and is) completely arbitrary;

it is justiﬁed by explicitly working out the matrix elements for the Stark and dipole-dipole

interactions, and ﬁnding that both conserve the value of q.

The inﬂuence of ˆI on each molecule is to reverse its direction of rotation about its own

axis, and to introduce a phase [28]:

APPENDIX B: CONSERVATION OF q

It is straightforward (if somewhat tedious) to write the symmetrized matrix elements for

diﬀerent contributions to the Hamiltonian, in terms of the unsymmetrized basis. We present

18

here some of the key results, which rely mostly on the symmetry properties of the angular

momentum recoupling coeﬃcients, as described in Brink and Satchler [24].

Dipolar interaction. In Eqn. (15), the 9-j symbol must be invariant under exchanging its

second and third rows, yet this operation introduces a phase shift (
. Therefore,
we must have J + J ′ = even, and the matrix element (15) is invariant under the substitution

K. In the symmetrized basis it reads

Thus the exchange quantum number x is explicitly conserved. Similarly, the matrix elements

are invariant under simultaneously reversing the signs of all ω’s and K, whereby

Because K = K ′ for the dipolar interaction, this implies in turn that q is conserved. The

matrix derivation of symmetrized matrix elements for the lambda-doubling is exactly the

same, and this interaction also conserves q.

Stark interaction. Symmetrized matrix elements of the Stark Hamiltonian (11) are

slightly more complicated, since reversing the sign of K also aﬀects the Wigner d-function.

From this point, translation into the x, q symmetrized basis is trivial. In general, q is not

are ignored.

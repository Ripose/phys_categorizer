Abstract

The electromagnetic modes and their ﬁeld distributions are determined for a dielectric

cylindrical structure embedded in another dielectric, with a thin metallic ﬁlm at the

cylinder/dielectric interface. These modes provide energy relaxation channels for ex-

cited dipole emitters located inside or outside the cylinder. Signiﬁcantly, we ﬁnd that

the emission rate is sensitive to the magnitude of the electron density of the metallic

ﬁlm coating. For typical parameter values, we ﬁnd large enhancements of the emission

rate, which can be in excess of three orders of magnitude, relative to the case in the

absence of the ﬁlm, arising at speciﬁc ranges of electron density. The theory is shown to

conform with known asymptotic limits, including the high density (perfect conductor)

limit, the low density (bare dielectrics) limit and the large distance (unbounded bulk)

limit, among others. The implications of the results for the purpose of atom cooling

and trapping and for the guiding of atoms within such microstructures are pointed out

and discussed.

There is at present much interest in small (micrometre to nanometre) scale spherical

[1,2] and cylindrical structures [3-11]. Cylindrical dielectric structures, are particularly

interesting for use not just as electromagnetic waveguides [3-5], but also as atom guides,

where the guiding mechanism is mainly controlled by excited cavity modes [6,7,10,11].

It is envisaged that the development of atom guides at such a small scale would lead to

many desirable advancements in atom lithography and should facilitate atomic physics

research.

The response of quantum systems to the vacuum ﬁelds supported by structures

of this kind is also of considerable interest currently. Although some work on the

coupling of the ﬁelds to electric dipoles near dielectric cylinders has been reported

recently using Green function and other methods [8], the greater majority of reports

have been concerned with cylindrical structures where the walls are totally impenetra-

ble to electromagnetic ﬁelds of all frequencies. In particular, Rippin and Knight [9]

quantised the electromagnetic modes in hollow cylindrical waveguides with perfectly

conducting walls and proceeded to calculate the decay rate of an oscillating electric

dipole located inside the cylindrical guide. The characteristics of such structures as

atom guides were subsequently explored [10,11]. However, the relevant experimental

work on atom guiding has been carried out on dielectric cylindrical guides (see Ref.

[12] and references therein) and there is clear need for treatments appropriate for the

more general situation, involving dielectric structures.

Furthermore, it has become clear in the context of atom mirrors that the presence of

a thin metallic ﬁlm can lead to a considerable enhancement of the electromagnetic ﬁelds

which could then be used to manipulate atoms eﬃciently in the presence of layered

dielectric structures [13-15]. For similar reasons it is envisaged that a metal coated

dielectric cylinder should form an eﬃcient atom guide. As far as the authors are aware

the eﬀect of a thin metallic ﬁlm coated at the cylinder surface on the electromagentic

properties has not been explored before, nor has the coupling of the electromagnetic

modes, modiﬁed by the presence of the ﬁlm, to atoms in the vicinity. In particular the

2

characteristics of dipole emission and the parameters which control the enhancement

need to be understood ﬁrst before the structure is explored for its merits as an atom

guide.

We therefore consider a general system comprising a dielectric cylinder of radius

R0 and dielectric function ǫ1(ω) embedded in a diﬀerent material of dielectric function

ǫ2(ω). Although we shall only deal with constant ǫ1 and ǫ2, these dielectric functions

can both, in general, be frequency-dependent. A thin ﬁlm of a given metal is intro-

duced at the cylindrical interface between the two dielectrics, with the main purpose

being the control of the evanescent modes arising under certain conditions, depending

on the dielectric functions ǫ1 and ǫ2. The role of the metallic ﬁlm is similar to that in

atomic mirrors where an overlayer is deposited on the planar dielectric surface of the

conventional layer structure. This has been shown, both experimentally and theoret-

ically, to lead to pronounced enhancement of the repulsive potential arising from the

modiﬁed evanescent mode [13-15].

The cylindrical system under investigation is schematically shown in Fig. 1(a) in

which an emitter of electric dipole moment vector µ and oscillation frequency ω0 is

situated at any point inside the cylinder (rt ≤ R0) or outside it (rt > R0) where R0 is

the cylinder radius and rt is the cylindrical polar radial position of the dipole emitter.

The allowed electromagnetic ﬁeld modes are evaluated using the photon tunneling

technique [16]. Brieﬂy, the photon tunneling procedure involves plane waves which can

either be transverse magnetic (TM), or transverse electric (TE) incident within region 2

(outside the cylinder) at an azimuthal angle φ0. This is reﬂected and transmitted at the

cylinder surface, producing appropriate linear combinations of TE and TM solutions at

the diﬀerent regions in a manner satisfying electromagnetic boundary conditions. For

this one needs to express the incoming plane wave form in terms of Bessel functions

In addition to the continuity of the tangential components of the electric ﬁeld vector

at the cylinder interface, the second set of boundary conditions must ensure that all

tangential magnetic ﬁeld components experience a jump due to the conductivity σ

associated with the metallic ﬁlm coating

σ =

inse2
m∗(ω + iγ)

Here ns is the two-dimensional electron density of the ﬁlm, and e and m∗ are the

electron charge and eﬀective mass, respectively, and γ << ω represents a small plasma

loss term. This boundary condition can be expressed as [13]

ˆrt × [H(R0+, φ, z) − H(R0−, φ, z)] = σEk(R0, φ, z)

(4)

where the magnetic ﬁeld vectors are evaluated at R0± which imply that the radial

coordinate approaches rt = R0 from outside the cylinder (+) and inside it (-). The

resulting ﬁeld distributions inside and outside the cylinder emerge in terms of Bessel

functions, reﬂecting the cylindrical symmetry of the structure. There are four types

of mode: propagating (kt1 and kt2 both real), evanescent (kt1 imaginary, kt2 real),

guided (kt1 real, kt2 imaginary) and surface modes (kt1 and kt2 both imaginary), whose

characteristics depend on the relative magnitudes of the dielectric functions ǫ1 and

ǫ2, as well as the electron density ns of the metallic coating. Figure 1(b) displays

the dispersion regions of the allowed modes in the ω versus kz plot. The light lines

corresponding to ǫ1 and ǫ2 are also shown. In general, the modes will have a mixture

of both TE and TM characters. However, in the limit ns → ∞ corresponding to the

perfect conductor case, they split into pure TE and pure TM forms [16].

where E(r) is the quantised electric ﬁeld vector operator at the position of the electric

dipole. The notation is such that |ei and |gi are the two quantum states representing

the dipole system, |{0}i stands for the vacuum ﬁeld state, |{k2, n, η}i is a single quan-

tum ﬁeld state of frequency ω(k2, n, η), n is an integer labelling the order of the Bessel

function and η runs over the allowed types of mode. In the case of propagating and

evanescent modes, the process of normalisation for the quantised ﬁelds is carried for a

plane wave in an inﬁnite bulk of material 2 (i.e. as though the cylinder does not exist).

For the surface and guided modes the quantisation process follows the familiar path. It

can be shown that the quantisation procedure amounts to determining normalisation

factors from the condition

where Eη(r, ω, k2) are the electric ﬁeld vector functions associated with the quantised

The result emerging from Eq.(5) should be modiﬁed to take account of the local

ﬁeld correction [17] such that

The expressions arising from Eq.(5), together with Eq.(7), by necessity, require nu-

merical evaluations, which permit the exploration of the changes in the characteristics

of the system with varying cylinder radius, dipole frequency, dipole position inside and

outside the cylinder and with varying metallic ﬁlm electron density. The results are

shown in Figs. 2 to 4.

Figure 2 exhibits the variations in the rate with the dipole radial position rt for

a cylinder of ﬁxed radius R0 = 500nm. The inset to the ﬁgure shows the variations

corresponding to the limiting cases ns = 0 (absence of the ﬁlm) [8] and ns = ∞

(perfectly conducting ﬁlm) [9-11]. The values at rt = 0 are for dipole position on

the cyinder axis. On the opposite side for rt large (rt >> R0), it is seen that all the

curves converge to the same value corresponding to the rate of a dipole embedded in

the inﬁnite bulk of dielectric 2.

In the vicinity of the ﬁlm where rt ≈ R0 marked

variations can be seen, depending on the density of the ﬁlm. For ns = 1020m−2 there

is considerable enhancement near the surface; at this density the dipole frequency is

at resonance with that of a surface mode. This is followed by a marked reduction at

ns = 1021m−2. Further increase in the density to ns = 1022m−2 results in the rate

dipping dramatically to smaller values approaching zero, at the surface, as one would

expect in the perfect conductor (large density) limit, shown in the inset to Fig. 2. Note

that, for this cylinder radius, in the large ns limit the lowest order (n = 0) mode is the

only mode allowed in a cylinder of impenetrable walls.

Figure 3 displays the variations of the emission rate with the ﬁlm density ns for a

dipole oriented parallel to the axis. The oscillation frequency is such that ¯hω0 = 0.5eV

and the radius of the cylinder is taken to be R0 = 500nm. Note the sudden onset of

the dip in the rate for the dipole at the centre of the cylinder and close to the surface

at rt = 0.9R0. This sudden dip with increasing density is for all dipoles located inside

the cylinder and which oscillate at ¯hω0 = 0.5eV. This feature can be explained by the

fact that at such a low frequency the lowest order mode cannot be excited since the

radius of the cylinder is below the cut-oﬀ condition λ0 > R0 that exists for a cylinder

surrounded by a perfect conductor.

By contrast, Fig. 4 displays the variations corresponding to the case in Fig. 3, but

for a dipole oscillating at frequency such that ¯hω0 = 1.5eV. Note the appearance of

the second peak at high density when the dipole is inside the cylinder near the surface

(dashed curve) and also the ﬁnite values at high densities for a dipole inside the cylinder

6

(dashed and solid curves). The ﬁnite values at high densities can be explained by the

fact that the lowest order mode in the corresponding perfect conductor (cylindrical

waveguide) case has a frequency below ω0 and this provides the necessary decay channel

leading to a ﬁnite emission rate. The second peak in the dashed curve (dipole near the

surface) is due to the next order mode in a cylinder with impenetrable walls which,

although it has a frequency just above ω0, is at resonance inside the cylinder with the

incoming TM wave within a certain ﬁnite range of surface densities.

From these results one clearly concludes that the presence of the metallic ﬁlm

modiﬁes the electromagnetic properties of the dielectric structure in a manner strongly

dependent on the electron density of the metallic ﬁlm. In particular, it can lead to a

considerable enhancement of the spontaneous rate. The theory also reproduces various

appropriate asymptotic limits, most notably: the high ns limit, corresponding to the

perfect conductor case, the zero ns limit, corresponding to the bare dielectric cylinder

case and the limit when the dipole is far away from the cylinder corresponding to an

unbounded medium 2. As mentioned previously, the enhancement of the evanescent

mode dut to the introduction of the metallic ﬁlm has been put to good use in the

context of atom mirrors. Similarly, the enhancement found here in the case of a metal

coated cylinder is envisaged to produce a repulsive force which acts on the atom near

the ﬁlm in a hollow cylindrical structure. This should lead to an eﬃcient atom guide

in such a manner which is dependent on the density of the metallic ﬁlm. The inﬂuence

of the ﬁniteness of the density in the metal-coated cylinder acting as an atom guide is

now under study and the results will be reported in due course.

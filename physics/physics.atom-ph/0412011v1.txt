(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We have performed a comparison of laser (LsOPM) and lamp (LpOPM) pumped cesium vapor
magnetometers. Although the LsOPM operated 50% above its shot-noise limit we found an intrinsic
sensitivity of 15 fT/√Hz and 25 fT/√Hz for the LsOPM and LpOPM respectively. Two modes of
operation, viz., the phase-stabilized and the self-oscillating mode were investigated and found to yield
a similar performance. We have compared the performance of the LsOPM and the LpOPM directly
by simultaneous measurements of ﬁeld ﬂuctuations of a 2 µT magnetic ﬁeld inside a multilayer
magnetic shield and have used one of the magnetometers for an active ﬁeld stabilization. In the
stabilized mode we found a gradient instability of 25 fT within an integration time of 100 s, which
represents an upper limit of the long-term stability of the magnetometers.

INTRODUCTION

temporal resolution.

The precise measurement and control of magnetic
ﬁelds and ﬁeld ﬂuctuations is of crucial importance in
many fundamental physics experiments. The suppres-
sion of systematic uncertainties in experiments search-
ing for permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs) in
atoms and neutrons is one prominent example. New
generations of EDM experiments with ultracold neutrons
(UCNs) aim at a higher statistical precision by the use of
higher UCN ﬂux and larger storage volumes. In such ex-
periments magnetic ﬁeld drifts and ﬂuctuations can pro-
duce false EDM signatures thereby putting stronger con-
straints on the magnetic ﬁeld control. Although magne-
tometers based on superconducting quantum interference
devices (SQUIDs) are the most sensitive magnetometers
available to date they are of limited interest for monitor-
ing magnetic ﬁelds in large volumes. Moreover, SQUIDs
do not measure absolute ﬁeld values.

Two distinct magnetometric techniques were used in
past EDM experiments. In the ILL experiment[1], which
has produced the presently lowest upper bound on the
neutron EDM, a vapor of 199Hg atoms ﬁlled into the ul-
tracold neutron storage chamber (20 liter) served as “co-
habitating” magnetometer. The PNPI experiment [2], on
the other side, used a set of two self-oscillating cesium va-
por magnetometers placed above and below the storage
chamber for monitoring the ﬁeld in the chamber. Both
techniques have pros and contras. Co-magnetometers
yield only a volume-averaged ﬁeld value, which yields
no information on ﬁeld gradients and their ﬂuctuations.
External magnetometers, on the other hand, do not mea-
sure the ﬁeld in the volume of interest directly, but allow
- if used in suﬃcient number - to access ﬁeld distribu-
tions, thereby permitting the active control of speciﬁc
multipole moments of the ﬁeld. Borisov et al. have pro-
posed a large volume (external) magnetometer based on
nuclear spin precession in 3He [3]. That device uses a
double pulse Ramsey resonance technique, which besides
its lack of spatial resolution also suﬀers from a lack of

The PNPI experiment used two conventional state-
of-the-art discharge lamp pumped self-oscillating cesium
vapor magnetometers (OPM)[2]. Such types of magne-
tometers - developed since the 1950’s - have a shot-noise
limited performance and large bandwidths. The high
spatial and temporal resolution of optically pumped al-
kali magnetometers thus make such devices interesting
alternatives for the continuous monitoring of ﬁelds, gra-
dients, and ﬂuctuations thereof. The use of alkali OPMs
for the ﬁeld control in larger volumes calls for a substan-
tially larger number of sensor heads, which suﬀers from
the fact that a single discharge lamp can only drive a lim-
ited number of sensors. The steady development in the
past decades of narrow-band semiconductor diode lasers
makes such light sources attractive alternatives to dis-
charge lamps. Owing to the high spectral density of its
radiation a single diode laser of moderate power (a few
mW) can be used to drive dozens of magnetometer heads.

Having a multichannel external magnetometer ap-
proach for a planned neutron EDM experiment in mind
we have performed a comparative study of state-of-the-
art discharge lamp pumped magnetometers (LpOPM)
and laser pumped magnetometers (LsOPM) using sim-
ilar room temperature sensor cells (7 cm and 6 cm di-
ameter respectively) and identical electronics. We dis-
cuss the principle of operation and details of their prac-
tical realization. The devices were operated in two dis-
tinct modes, viz., the self-oscillating mode and the phase-
stabilized mode. Details of the development and perfor-
mance of the LsOPM have been published earlier [4]. We
have determined the intrinsic sensitivities of the magne-
tometers and present measurements of the ﬂuctuations
of a 2 µT ﬁeld recorded simultaneously by the LsOPM
and the LpOPM in a multi-layer magnetic shield. The
LpOPM reached its ultimate shot-noise limited perfor-
mance while the LsOPM showed a superior intrinsic sen-
sitivity, although its performance still lies 50% above its
fundamental shot-noise limit.

and the ﬁeld measurement reduces to a frequency mea-
surement. In Eq. 1 the subscript of γA refers to the total
angular momentum of the precessing atomic state. Al-
though OPMs based on nuclear spin polarization were
demonstrated in the past [1, 3, 5, 6] we restrict the
present discussion to alkali vapors in which the precess-
ing levels are one or both of the hyperﬁne ground states
with total angular momentum F = I
1/2, where I is
the nuclear spin. Magnetic resonance is used to mea-
sure the precession frequency by inducing resonant spin
ﬂips by a weak magnetic ﬁeld B1 oriented at right angles
with respect to B0 and oscillating at the frequency ωrf .
Although for the magnetometer discussed here ωrf
lies
in the audio range of frequencies the index “rf” (radio-
frequency) is used to comply with common notation.

Optical pumping with a resonant circularly polarized
light beam creates spin polarization in the medium (room
temperature alkali atom vapor contained in a glass cell)
and hence an associated net bulk magnetization. It has
been realized for many years that the pumping process

general the optically pumped medium becomes transpar-
ent with respect to the pumping light, except for the spec-
trally resolved closed
tran-
sition [7], in which case the absorption of the pumped
medium increases. The fact that the optical properties
of the medium depend on its spin polarization is used to
detect the magnetic resonance transition by monitoring
either the power or the polarization of the transmitted
or scattered light beam. The technique is known as op-
tically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR).

In the present study we have used a particular realiza-
tion of the ODMR technique, the so-called Mx-method,
in which B0 is oriented at 45◦ with respect to the direc-
tion of propagation (
k) of the circularly polarized light
beam. The particular feature of that technique is that the
transmitted light intensity is modulated at the frequency
ωrf of the oscillating ﬁeld, when ωrf is tuned close to ωL.
The amplitude of the modulation depends as sin 2θ with
cos θ =
k. The amplitude and phase of the modula-
tion depend on ωrf as a classical Lorentz oscillator with
a resonance frequency ωL. On resonance the phase shift
between the oscillating B1-ﬁeld and the transmitted light
modulation is 90◦ and for a small detuning δω = ωrf −
ωL
the phase shift varies linearly with δω. The width of the
resonance(s) are determined by the transverse relaxation

rate of the spin polarization, which is limited by sev-
eral eﬀects. In atom-atom collisions only the sum of the
angular momenta of the collision partners is preserved
but spin-exchange processes can change the individual
polarizations. The rate of spin exchange depolarization
is proportional to the collision rate, i.e., to the vapor
density, the spin-exchange cross-section, and the relative
velocities of the collision partners. The dominant depo-
larization mechanism is due to collisions of the atoms
with the cell walls and the depolarization rate depends
on the adsorption time of the atoms on the walls and on
the wall collision rate. This process can be suppressed
by either preventing the atoms from reaching the walls
through the addition of an inert buﬀer gas or by reduc-
ing the sticking time on the walls by a suitable coating of
the wall surfaces by paraﬃn or silanes. However, these
coatings may act as a sink for alkali atoms thereby sig-
niﬁcantly lower the atomic density [8]. A stable vapor
pressure is established by having the vapor in thermal
equilibrium with a droplet of alkali metal contained in a
sidearm. Depolarizing collisions with the bulk metal are
suppressed by connecting the cell proper to the sidearm
via a small aperture.

The intrinsic linewidth resulting from the combined ac-
tion of the mentioned depolarization eﬀects depends on
temperature, quality of the wall coating and cell geom-
etry. Besides those intrinsic broadening mechanisms the
interaction with the optical ﬁeld and with the oscillating
magnetic ﬁeld further broaden the magnetic resonance
line. These processes are known as optical and r.f. power
broadening respectively.

B. Eﬀects of hyperﬁne structure

The ground state of alkali atoms with a nuclear spin
I splits into two hyperﬁne levels with total angular mo-
1/2 with 2F± + 1 Zeeman sublevels la-
menta F± = I
beled by the magnetic quantum number M , respectively.
The general evolution of the hyperﬁne levels in a mag-
netic ﬁeld is described by the Breit-Rabi-Formula [9]. In
hyperﬁne in-
low magnetic ﬁelds (Zeeman interaction
teraction) the energy of the state
is shifted by

much smaller than the resonance linewidth. The low ﬁeld
approximation (Eq. 1) is therefore valid for the present
work.

C. Practical realization

In this work we compare the performance of lamp
pumped and laser pumped magnetometers. Both de-
vices have a common basic design consisting of the light
source, the sensor head, the detector and feedback elec-
tronics (Figs. 1, 2). The sensor head contains the sensor
proper, a spherical glass cell (60 mm diameter for the
LpOPM, produced in the group of one of the authors,

with paraﬃn in which cesium vapor is in thermal equi-
librium with a droplet of metallic cesium at room tem-
perature. The cell is mounted in a (200 mm long, 110 mm
diameter) cylindrical housing. The pumping light is car-
ried from the light source to the sensor cell by a multi-
mode ﬁber (800 µm diameter) in the LsOPM and by a
ﬁbre bundle (6 mm diameter) in the LpOPM. The light
transmitted through the cell is carried back to a detec-
tor (photodiode) by an identical ﬁber in the LsOPM and
by an 8 mm diameter ﬁber bundle in the LpOPM. The
lengths of the ﬁbers are 8 m and 5 m length respectively
for the laser and the lamp pumped device. The sensor
head contains also polarization optics (linear polarizer
and quarter-wave plate) for making the light circularly
polarized prior to entering the cell as well as lenses for
collimating the incoming light and focussing the outgoing
light into the return ﬁber (bundle). Particular care was
taken to use only non-magnetic components in the sensor
head. The coils producing the oscillating ﬁeld consist of
two 70 mm diameter loops with 12 turns of copper wire
each, separated by 52 mm. When two sensors are oper-
ated in close proximity, the cross-talk of the respective
r.f. ﬁelds is avoided by sliding a 1 mm thick Al cylinder
over the heads. The optical, electronic and mechanical
components of the LsOPM were produced at the Univer-
sity of Fribourg, while the LpOPM was realized at the
Ioﬀe Institute.

the diﬀerent layers as described in Tab. I. C: magnetic ﬁeld
coil.

The characterization of the magnetometers described
in Sec. III A was performed in Fribourg. Two magne-
tometers were placed inside of a multi-layer cylindrical
magnetic shield as shown in Fig. 3 and Tab. I. The mag-
netic ﬁeld of 2 µT was produced by a 50 cm long, 15 cm
diameter solenoid driven by an ultra-low noise current
supply.

For a direct comparison of the noise performance with
an accuracy below 0.1 pT the level of magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuc-
tuations at the experimental site have to be kept below
that level, a performance, which is hard to realize. Mag-
netic ﬁeld variations (in a 1 Hz bandwidth) in unshielded
environments are of the order of several nTrms or more.
A shielding factor exceeding 10’000 is thus needed to sup-
press ﬂuctuations at that level.

D. Features of the LsOPM and the LpOPM

6P1/2i

In both types of magnetometers the D1 transition
of Cs at a wavelength of 894 nm is
6S1/2i → |
|
used for optical pumping. The LpOPM is driven by an
electrodeless discharge lamp, in which a power stabilized
high frequency generator (
100 MHz) produces a dis-
∼
charge in a 12 mm diameter glass bulb containing cesium
vapor and Xenon as buﬀer gas. The pumping light is
collimated and ﬁltered by a D1 interference ﬁlter cen-
tered at 894.5 nm with a FWHM=11.5 nm. Because of
the high temperature of the discharge plasma the spec-
trum of the emitted D1 radiation is considerably broader
than the Doppler width of the room temperature absorp-
tion line in the sensor cell. All four hyperﬁne components
of the D1 line are excited simultaneously as indicated in
Fig. 4(a). As the same light is used for detecting the
ground state spin precession the LpOPM detects mag-
netic resonance in both the F=4 and the F=3 hyperﬁne
ground states. Because of the diﬀering g-factors of the
two states (Eq. 5) the corresponding magnetic resonance
lines are split by 22 Hz in the 2 µT ﬁeld, which is larger
than the width of the magnetic resonance lines (
2.5–
5 Hz) under optimized conditions. The F=3 component

is much weaker than the F=4 component, so that the
former plays a minor role for magnetometry.

The LsOPM is pumped by a tunable extended cav-
ity laser in Littman conﬁguration (Sacher Lasertech-
nik, model TEC500). The output power of more than
10 mW exceeds the power required for magnetometry by
more than three orders of magnitude. Therefore a single
laser can be used to drive dozens of magnetometers in
experiments calling for the simultaneous monitoring of
the magnetic ﬁeld in diﬀerent locations. The laser fre-
quency is actively stabilized to the Doppler broadened

F = 3 hyperﬁne transition using a dichroic
atomic vapor laser lock (DAVLL) [10] in an auxiliary
(vacuum) cesium cell. This lock is very stable and allows
a reliable operation of the magnetometer over measure-
ment periods of several weeks.

the narrow band light. This process, called hyperﬁne
pumping, degrades the eﬃciency of the optical pumping
process and reduces the overall spin polarization which
can be achieved with laser radiation. A straightforward
6S1/2; F = 3, M
way to reduce that loss is to empty the
i
|
sublevels using a repumping laser tuned to a transition
emanating from the F=3 hyperﬁne ground state. An
experimental study of that process is underway. In the
LpOPM all four hyperﬁne components are pumped si-
multaneously. As a result the loss due to hyperﬁne pump-
ing is excluded and a larger spin polarization is obtained
in the F=4 state. The drawback of the large spectral
width of the beam from the lamp is that an appreciable
part of its spectrum lies outside of the room temperature
absorption spectrum of the sensor cell. The correspond-
ing photons carry no spectroscopic information, but pro-
duce excess shot noise in the detected photocurrent. In

that respect narrow-band laser light leads to a better de-
tection eﬃciency in the LsOPM.

E. Modes of operation

Both types of magnetometers were operated in two dif-
ferent modes. The self-oscillating mode (SOM) (Fig. 2
a) uses the fact that at resonance the driving r.f. ﬁeld
and the modulated photocurrent are dephased by 90◦.
For that reason the sinusoidal part of the photocurrent
can be used, with an appropriate ampliﬁcation and phase
shift to drive the r.f. coils in a feedback loop. In such
a conﬁguration the system will auto-oscillate at the Lar-
mor frequency. An amplitude gain control ensures that
the amplitude of the coil current is kept constant inde-
pendently of phase and frequency, so that any r.f. power
dependent systematic eﬀects are suppressed.

The phase-stabilized mode (PSM) (Fig. 2 b) also uses
the characteristic phase dependence between the applied
oscillating ﬁeld and the modulation of the detected pho-
tocurrent for locking the frequency of an external os-
cillator to the Larmor frequency. The phase, the in-
phase component, and the quadrature component are
detected simultaneously by a lock-in ampliﬁer (Stanford
Research Systems SR830). Both the in-phase signal (dis-
persive Lorentzian) and the 90◦ phase shifted phase sig-
nal (arctan-dependence) show a linear zero-crossing near
zero detuning (ωrf = ωL). Either of the two signals can
thus be used as discriminant in a feedback loop, which
stabilizes the phase to 90◦. It can be shown that from a
statistical point of view both signals yield an equivalent
magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity. The phase signal is less sen-
sitive to light power ﬂuctuations, which may be advan-
tageous to suppress systematic eﬀects related to power
ﬂuctuations [11]. However, the used commercial digi-
tal lock-in ampliﬁer had only a moderate update rate of
400 Hz of its phase output, so that the much faster in-
phase signal was used in the feedback loop.

In principle the PSM can be understood as a variant
of the SOM, in which the phase-detector, the VCO, and

modes of operation changes of the magnetic ﬁeld lead to
instantaneous changes of the Larmor frequency and thus
to instantaneous changes of the transmitted modulation
frequency. The time needed for the radio-frequency to
adjust to a new value after a sudden ﬁeld change depends
on the ﬁlters and other delays in the feedback loop. If a
very fast response is not required, as in our applications,
the bandwidth can be decreased by appropriate ﬁlters. In
the SOM it is the preampliﬁer of the photodetector which
limits the bandwidth to 10 kHz, whereas in the PSM the
feedback loop ﬁlters provide a bandwidth up to 1 kHz [4].
From a practical point of view the registered bandwidth
is limited by the data acquisition system. Because of the
frequency dependence of the phase-shifter the SOM is,
in general, optimized only for a given Larmor frequency,
which reduces the dynamic range of the SOM device. The

duced to about 250 Hz. Note that using the phase-stabilized
LpOPM yields the same result since the bandwidth is inde-
pendent of the light source.

phase-stabilized magnetometer keeps the phase-shift at
90◦ independently of the Larmor frequency. In practice
the dynamic range is limited by the frequency range of
the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) used to generate
the oscillating ﬁeld. The long-term stability of both feed-
back schemes is limited by temperature dependent phase
drifts.

The Al shield slipped over each magnetometer for
avoiding cross-talk eﬀectively acts as a low-pass ﬁlter for
external magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations (skin eﬀect) which
reduces the response bandwidth of all devices to about
250 Hz (Fig. 5).

III. PERFORMANCE

A. Magnetometric sensitivity: Basics and
fundamental limit

The sensitivity of the magnetometer is deﬁned as the
noise equivalent magnetic ﬂux density (NEM), which is
the ﬂux density change δB equivalent to the total noise
of the detector signal.
In a perfectly stable external
magnetic ﬁeld the smallest detectable ﬁeld changes are
limited by the intrinsic magnetometer noise δBint. For
a measurement bandwidth ∆νbw the intrinsic resolution
δBint depends on the magnetic resonance linewidth ∆ν
(HWHM) and on the signal-to-noise ratio S/Nint of the
magnetometer signal according to

light power after the sensor cell. The power spectrum of
the spectral power density of an ideal magnetometer in
a perfectly stable magnetic ﬁeld thus consists of a delta
function centered at the Larmor frequency, superposed
on a ﬂat background of shot-noise ﬂuctuations. In prac-
tice the peak is broadened by the resolution (1 Hz) of
the FFT analyzer (Stanford Research Systems, model
SR760) used for its recording. The relevant noise con-
tributions which deﬁne the S/N ratio are ﬂuctuations of
the photocurrent at the Larmor frequency, i.e., the value
of the background below the Larmor peak. In practice
that ideal spectrum is modiﬁed by various imperfections
which degrade the magnetometer performance.
In the
following we address contributions from light power ﬂuc-
tuations and magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations.

FIG. 6: Power spectral density of the low frequency noise of
the laser power. The power was 13 µW and the corresponding
shot-noise level is shown as solid line. The noise at 7 kHz,
which lies 50% above the shot noise level, is also shown.

Fig. 6. The individual peaks are even and odd harmon-
ics of the 50 Hz line frequency. Power ﬂuctuations con-
tribute to the photocurrent noise at ωL by two distinct
processes. First, there is a direct contribution via the
noise component of I0 in Eq. 12 at the Fourier frequency
ωL. At ωL/2π= 7 kHz this noise level is close to the
shot-noise level. The second contribution is due to the
second term in (12). Each Fourier component (at ω) of
the power ﬂuctuations is multiplied by cos ωLt, and this
ω in the power density
mixing produces sidebands at ωL ±
spectrum. In this way the continuous low frequency part
of the technical noise around ω = 0 (Fig. 6) produces
a symmetric background under the Larmor peak. Al-
though the power noise around ω = 0 is 18 times (Fig. 6)
larger than the shot noise around ω = ωL, it is suppressed
- according to Eq. 12 - by a factor ξ, which has a value
of approximately 0.05 in the LsOPM. As a consequence
the contribution of the modulation term in Eq. 12 to the
photocurrent noise is less than the contribution from I0.
We have veriﬁed that this is indeed fulﬁlled in a carefully
calibrated auxiliary experiment.

C. Limitations by magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations

In presence of uncorrelated magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations,
δBext, the highest resolution with which a magnetic ﬁeld
change can be detected is given by δB =
ext.
The ﬂuctuations δBext of the external magnetic ﬁeld can
be parameterized by the equivalent noise Next that they
produce on the signal, and δB can be expressed in a form
similar to Eq. 9 by

The light power Iin has a continuous (technical) noise
spectrum, which lies above the shot-noise level, in partic-

ﬂuctuations at frequency ω will mix with the magnetome-

ﬁeld ﬂuctuations, such as the 50 Hz line frequency and
harmonics thereof produce symmetric sidebands, while
low frequency magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations produce a con-
tinuous background underlying the Larmor peak.

of the photocurrent noise on the light power for the laser
in comparison to that of the lamp.
In those measure-
ments only the noise component of I0 (Eq. 12) at 7 kHz
was recorded as it represents the dominant noise contri-
bution of Ipc. For each of the measurements the cesium
cell was removed and the light beam was detected directly
by the photodiode using a transimpedance ampliﬁer for
the photocurrent. The noise N0 measured in this way
gives a lower limit of the intrinsic magnetometer perfor-
mance. The results for the laser and lamp source are
shown in Fig. 9. The noise can be written as

N 2

(16)

where NSN is the shot-noise of the photocurrent, Ndark
the intrinsic detector (photodiode and ampliﬁer) noise,
and NT technical noise of the light source, which is pro-
portional to the photocurrent I0.

Ndark was measured with the light beams blocked for
all (discrete) ampliﬁcation stages of the transimpedance
ampliﬁer. With the highest ampliﬁcation (10−1 µA/V)

D. Measurement of the intrinsic sensitivity

The intrinsic linewidth of the magnetic resonance tran-
sition was measured by extrapolating the experimental
linewidth to zero light power and zero r.f. power. We
found a HWHM of 1.63 Hz for the cell in the LpOPM and
2.35 Hz for the cell in the LsOPM. As all cells were manu-
factured by the same person the diﬀerence of the intrinsic
linewidths is probably due to the slightly larger aper-
ture between the cell and the sidearm in the case of the
LsOPM. After optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio with
respect to light and r.f. power the (power-broadened)
magnetic resonance linewidth (HWHM) is ∆ν = 2.5 Hz
for the LpOPM and 5.0 Hz for the LsOPM.

Figures 7 and 8 show typical power density spectra -
recorded in the phase-stabilized and self-oscillating mode
of operation - of the r.m.s. voltage ﬂuctuations at the
output of the current-to-voltage preampliﬁer of the pho-
todiode current. The spectra contain all structures dis-
cussed above. The pedestal (indicated as dashed area
in Fig. 7) underlying the Larmor peak contains contri-
butions from ﬂuctuations of the light power and of the
magnetic ﬁeld. The white noise ﬂoor in the far wings of
the central structure represents the intrinsic OPM noise
Nint. Its numerical value for use in Eq. 9 was measured
70 Hz above the carrier. At that frequency this noise rep-
resents the noise component of I0 of the power noise in
Eq. 12. We have veriﬁed that the noise component of
the modulated contribution in Eq. 12 is 8 times less than
the noise contribution of I0 under present experimental
conditions. The pedestal under the Larmor peak is thus
most probably due to low-frequency ﬁeld ﬂuctuations.

After optimizing the magnetometric sensitivity with
respect to light power and r.f. power the LpOPM yields
a S/N ratio of 29000, while the LsOPM reaches 98000
in a bandwidth ∆νbw of 1 Hz. It can be seen from the
ﬁgures that the signal-to-noise ratio does not depend on
the mode of operation (SOM or PSM). For the LpOPM
the shot-noise level is nearly reached while in the LsOPM
Nint = 1.5
NSN. According to Eq. 9 the measured S/N
ratios and linewidths under optimized conditions result
a NEM δBint of 25 fT for the LpOPM and of 15 fT for
the LsOPM in a bandwidth of 1 Hz. The LsOPM is thus
1.7 times more sensitive than the LpOPM, although its
performance is not yet shot-noise limited.

levels are represented by horizontal lines.

used for I0 < 600 nA we measured Ndark = 48 fA/√Hz.
This corresponds to the shot noise of a current I0 of 7 nA,
so that above 7 nA the intrinsic detector noise can be ne-
glected. This dark current is responsible for the deviation
of the measured noise from the (dotted) shot-noise line
(Fig. 9) at low currents.

For larger photocurrents technical noise NT, which is
proportional to the light power, dominates over the shot
10−7 and
noise. We found NT = k
I0, with kLs = 2.6
10−7 for the laser and the lamp source respec-
kLp = 0.8
tively. With the laser source the shot noise NSN becomes
equal to the technical noise NT for a photocurrent I0 of
4.9 µA, which thus yields a noise level N0 = √2NSN at
that photocurrent. The laser power for optimized mag-
netometer parameters corresponds to 5 µA, thereby ex-
plaining the excess noise of the LsOPM in Figs. 7 and
8. In the case of lamp pumping the technical noise be-
comes important for I0 > 60 µA, so that the magnetome-
ter is shot-noise limited for the (optimized) photocurrent
of 4.3 µA.

If one succeeds in eliminating the excess noise of the
laser power, e.g., by an active power stabilization of the
LsOPM one can achieve an intrinsic shot-noise limited

sensitivity of 10 fT, thereby outperforming the LpOPM
by a factor of 2.5. This is compatible with earlier results
[12] obtained from a comparative study of lamp and laser
pumped magnetometers using 39K, in which the sensitiv-
ity of the LsOPM version was found to be 2.3 times higher
than of the corresponding LpOPM device. It is also inter-
esting to compare those results with the present results
on an absolute scale. The sensitivity of the 39K-LsOPM
was found to be 1.8 fT/√Hz. This superior performance
compared to the 133Cs magnetometer discussed here is
mainly due to the two times larger diameter of the potas-
sium sensor cell, which, combined with the appreciably
smaller spin exchange cross section of potassium, led to
an operating linewidth of 1 Hz compared to 5 Hz with
the present Cs-LsOPM. Furthermore the g-factor of 39K
is twice as large than that of 133Cs. These two factors
explain the superior performance of the K-magnetometer
(1.8 fT) compared to the Cs magnetometer (15 fT).

IV. APPLICATIONS

A. Direct comparison of LsOPM and LpOPM

We performed a direct comparison of the performance
of the LpOPM and the LsOPM in simultaneous mea-
surements of magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations inside the multi-
layer shield described above (Fig. 3). Both devices were
mounted coaxially in the shield and the centers of their
sensor cells were separated by 21 cm. The oscillatory sig-
nal of each magnetometer was ﬁltered by a resonance
ampliﬁer, centered near 7 kHz with a FWHM of 500 Hz,
and analyzed by a frequency counter (Stanford Research
Systems, model SR620) with a gate time of 0.1 s. An
example of such a recording over a continuous interval
of 6 hours with the LpOPM operated in PSM and the
LsOPM operated in the SOM is shown in Fig. 10. One
sees that both devices oscillate a diﬀerent average fre-
quencies, which can be explained by the presence of a
magnetic ﬁeld gradient of 66 pT/cm which drifts by 0.4%
over the 6 hour interval. The drift is probably due to a
thermal drift of the shield’s magnetization. Similar gra-
dients were measured after interchanging the positions of
the two OPMs. Figure 11 shows a 5 minutes time slice
of the data in Fig. 10. There are highly correlated irreg-

ular ﬁeld jumps of approximately 3.6 pT in both traces.
These ﬂuctuations correspond to relative ﬂuctuations of
the solenoid current at a level of 10−6 and are suspected
to be caused by the current source. The Allan standard
deviation [13] of the data is a convenient way for char-
acterizing the ﬁeld drifts on various time scales. Fig. 12
shows the Allan plot of the data from Fig. 10 as a func-
tion of integration time both in absolute and in relative
units. Both magnetometers show the same ﬁeld stabil-
ity and the data points are indistinguishable for small
integration times. While the short term stability is gov-
erned by white noise, the bump between 1 and 200 s is
due to the irregular ﬁeld jumps. The long term stability
is determined by long term ﬁeld drifts of the imperfectly
shielded external ﬁeld and thermal drifts of the solenoid
support structure. At the encountered level of ﬁeld ﬂuc-
tuations possible false eﬀects due to the light shift are
negligible [4].

B. Active ﬁeld stabilization

We have further investigated the performance of the
magnetometers in an active magnetic ﬁeld stabilization
system using a phase-locked loop. For that purpose the
phase of the LpOPM oscillation (PSM) relative to the
phase of a reference oscillator was measured by a lock-
in ampliﬁer and used as error signal driving a correction
coil. While ﬁeld ﬂuctuations common to both sensors
are strongly suppressed by this method, gradient drifts
and ﬂuctuations are not compensated and thus detected
by the free-running magnetometer. The performance of
the stabilization scheme is shown in Fig. 13, where the
top traces represent time series of the ﬁeld readings (1 s
gate time of the frequency counter) of the free-running
LsOPM and the LpOPM used for the feedback. The
lower part of Fig. 13 shows the Allan standard deviation
of those data. The jumps in the magnetic ﬁeld measured
by the LsOPM (Fig. 11) are completely suppressed by
the feedback loop and only white noise in the short term
stability and contributions from gradient drifts in the
long term stability remain. The ﬁeld ﬂuctuations reach
a minimum of 25 fT for τ =100 s, which corresponds to
10−8. Due to the fact that
a relative ﬁeld stability of 1.3
·
the ﬁeld is stabilized to the LpOPM one would expect
a signiﬁcant lowering of the LpOPM’s Allan standard
deviation for short integration times. The white noise
behavior (slope
1/2 in the Allan plot) of the LpOPM
trace is entirely due to the resolution of the frequency
counter, which is limited by trigger time jitter due to
amplitude noise of the measured sine wave.

−

We also realized a setup, in which the roles of the
LsOPM and the LpOPM were reversed. The observed
performance was identical with the one described.

V. FURTHER APPLICATIONS

OPMs based on Cs vapor are well suited for operation
in magnetic ﬁelds smaller than 10 µT (such as typical
ﬁelds used in neutron EDM experiments). In such ﬁelds
asymmetries of the magnetic resonance line due to the
quadratic Zeeman eﬀect will not aﬀect their long-term
stability (accuracy). In ﬁelds between 10 µT and 200 µT
the line asymmetry due to the quadratic Zeeman eﬀect
depends on the light power and power ﬂuctuations induce
ﬂuctuations of that asymmetry and thus of the resonance
frequency. In magnetic ﬁelds above 300 µT the quadratic
Zeeman shift exceeds the linewidth and the magnetic res-
onance spectrum consists of 8 resolved lines [14]. This
oﬀers a further possibility for the use of cesium magne-
tometers. The performance of the LsOPM in that ﬁeld
range is expected not to be worse than the one measured
in a 2 µT ﬁeld. This expectation is based on the fact that
the (performance determining) laser power noise does not
increase with frequency, so that a shot-noise limited sen-

sitivity can be reached. A magnetometer based on the
quadratic Zeeman eﬀect in potassium has been demon-
strated earlier [15].

In contrast to buﬀer gas cells, which require the whole
cell volume to be illuminated in order to achieve a max-
imum sensitivity, paraﬃn-coated cells can be pumped
with a laser beam of much smaller diameter. This allows
one to adapt the spatial dimensions of the paraﬃn-coated
sensors to speciﬁc experimental requirements. One can
think, e.g., of using very large cells of several liters for
measuring volume averaged ﬁelds. Compared to other
proposed large cell schemes[3], the use of a Cs-OPM of-
fers the further advantage of a high temporal resolution.
Recently, a novel type of optically pumped magnetome-
ter with a sub-fT (gradiometric) sensitivity was demon-
strated [16]. Besides its use of very high buﬀer gas pres-

11

sures and its operation at a temperature of 190◦C, spe-
ciﬁc features of that magnetometer are its limited oper-
ation range near zero ﬁeld and its reduced bandwidth of
20 Hz.

We report ab initio relativistic correlation calculations of potential curves for ten low-lying elec-
tronic states, eﬀective electric ﬁeld on the electron and hyperﬁne constants for the 3∆1 state of
the HfF+ cation that is suggested to be used as the working state in experiments to search for the
electric dipole moment of the electron. Calculations show that HfF+ has deeply bound 1Σ+ ground
state, its dissociation energy is De = 6.4 eV. The 3∆1 state is obtained to be the ﬁrst excited state
lying about 0.2 eV higher. The calculated eﬀective electric ﬁeld Eeﬀ = Wd|Ω| acting on an electron
in this state is 5.84 × 1024Hz/(e·cm).

Introduction. The search for the electric dipole mo-
ment of the electron (eEDM), de, remains one of the most
fundamental problems in physics. Up to now only upper
limits were obtained for
. The tightest bound on de
de|
|
was obtained in the experiment on the Tl atom [1], which
established an upper bound of
cm (e
·
is the charge of the electron). It seems unlikely that ex-
periments on atoms can give tighter bounds. Molecular
systems, on the other hand, provide a way for much en-
hanced sensitivity, since the eﬀective intramolecular elec-
tric ﬁeld acting on electrons in polar molecules can be ﬁve
or more orders of magnitude higher than the maximal
ﬁeld available in the laboratory.

The new generation of the eEDM experiments, employ-
ing polar heavy-atom molecules, is expected to reach sen-
sitivity of 10−30
cm/√day (e.g., see [2]). Their
·
results are expected to dramatically inﬂuence all the pop-
ular extensions of the standard model, in particular su-
persymmetry, even if bounds on the P, T -odd eﬀects com-
patible with zero are obtained (see [3, 4] and references
therein). These studies include the beam experiments
carried out on YbF molecular radicals by E. Hinds group
at Imperial College, London [2], and the vapor cell ex-
periment on the metastable a(1) state of PbO prepared
by the group of DeMille at Yale University (see [5] and
references therein). New ways of searching for eEDM,
using trapped cold molecular cations, were investigated
during last two years at JILA by E. Cornell group. The
ﬁrst candidate was HI+ [6], but subsequent calculations
by our group [7] have shown that the cation has rather
small EDM enhancement factor (the ﬁrst estimate of the
enhancement was given by Ravaine et al.
[8]). Then
some more motivated candidates were considered, HfH+
[9], HfF+ [10] etc., having, possibly, 3∆ as the ground
or at least long-lived ﬁrst excited state. The goal of the
present paper is theoretical analysis of HfF+ as a candi-
date for the eEDM experiment.

An important feature of such experiments is that the
knowledge of the eﬀective electric ﬁeld, Eeﬀ , seen by
an unpaired electron is required for extracting de from
the measurements. Eeﬀ can not be obtained in an ex-
periment, rather, electronic structure calculations are

E is the inner molecular electric ﬁeld, σ are the Pauli
matrices. Recently, the Wd value for 3∆1 state is esti-
mated in the scalar-relativistic approximation by Meyer
et al. [14] and the method used for calculation of Wd is
close in essence to that developed by us earlier [15] and
applied to ﬁrst two-step calculations of the PbF molecule
[11, 15]. We recalculate Wd here to obtain a more reliable
value. In the present work, the hyperﬁne constants for
177Hf and 19F nuclei (Ak[Hf] and Ak[F]) for the 3∆1 state
of HfF+ are also calculated. As the experimental value
Ak[Hf] is known, it provides an accuracy check for the
calculated Wd value. Both Ak[Hf] and Ak[F] values are
useful for identifying HfF+ by his spectrum from another
species in the experiment. Accurate theoretical study of
spectroscopic properties is also required already at the
stage of preparation of the HfF+ experiment since the
needed spectroscopic information is not available from
other sources.
In particular, an open question was to
clarify, which state is the ground one, 1Σ+ or 3∆1. In
the former case, the half-life of the working 3∆1 state is
also required.

Methods and calculations. The 12-electron general-
ized relativistic eﬀective core potential (GRECP) [16]
simulating interaction with the explicitly excluded 1s to
4f electrons is used in 20-electron calculations of HfF+.
In 10-electron calculations which are substantially less
time consuming, 5s and 5p spinors of hafnium and 1s or-
bital of ﬂuorine are frozen and not treated explicitly. The

generalized correlation atomic basis set (GCBS) [17, 18]
(12s16p16d10f 10g)/[6s5p5d3f 1g] is constructed for Hf.
The ANO-L (14s9p4d3f )/[4s3p2d1f ] atomic basis set
listed in the molcas 4.1 library [19] was used for ﬂu-
orine. The molecular orbitals are obtained by the com-
plete active space self-consistent ﬁeld (CASSCF) method
[19, 20] with the spin-averaged part of the GRECP [21],
i.e. only scalar-relativistic eﬀects are taken into account
at this stage. In the CASSCF method, orbitals are sub-
divided into three groups:
inactive, active and virtual.
Inactive orbitals are doubly occupied in all the conﬁg-
urations, all possible occupations are allowed for active
orbitals, whereas virtual orbitals are not occupied. So,
wave function is constructed as a full conﬁguration inter-
action expansion in the space of active orbital and both
active and inactive orbitals are optimized for subsequent
correlation calculations of HfF+. Using the C2v point
group classiﬁcation scheme, ﬁve orbitals in A1, four in
B1 and B2 and two in A2 irreps are included into the
active space. In 10-electron calculations, one orbital in
the A1 irreps (which is mainly 2s orbital of F) belongs to
the inactive space. In 20-electron CASSCF calculations,
the 5s and 5p orbitals of Hf and 1s orbital of F are added
to the space of inactive orbitals.

Next, the spin-orbit direct conﬁguration interaction
(SODCI) approach [22, 23, 24] modiﬁed by our group
to include relativistic (spin-orbit) conﬁguration selec-
tion procedure [25] with the selected single and dou-
ble excitations from some multiconﬁgurational reference
states (“mains”) is employed on the sets of diﬀerent ΛS
many-electron spin- and space-symmetry adapted basis
functions (SAFs). Details on features of constructing
the reference space and selection procedure are given in
Refs. [25, 26, 27].

To obtain spectroscopic parameters, six points between
3.1 and 4.0 a.u. and point at 100 a.u. of the HfF+ poten-
tial curves were calculated for ten lowest-lying states in
10-electron calculations and for four states in 20-electron
ones.

The core properties Ak and Wd were calculated only for
the working 3∆1 state at point 3.4 a.u., which is close to
the equilibrium distance (see Table I). Before calculating
core properties the shapes of the four-component molec-
ular spinors are restored in the inner core region after
the two-component GRECP calculation of the molecule.
For this purpose the nonvariational one-center restora-
tion (NOCR) method [15, 21, 27, 28, 29, 30] is applied.
Results and discussion. The result of calculations for
HfF+ spectroscopic parameters are presented in Table I.

The ﬁrst point to note is that the cation is deeply bound.
Second important result is that the 1Σ+ state appears to
be the ground one and the working state, 3∆1, is the
ﬁrst excited one. Besides, the excitation energy from
1Σ+ to 3∆1 is increased from 866 cm−1 to 1633 cm−1
after including the 5s and 5p shells of Hf and 1s shell of
F to the relativistic correlation calculation. Excitation
energies from 1Σ+ to other calculated low-lying states
are also increased. Similarly, the increase is expected
for excitation energies of the rest six states. The SO
splittings of the 3∆ and 3Π states are mainly due to the
SO splitting of the 5d shell of Hf:

Hso = a

The atomic Dirac-Fock calculation of Hf+ gives

and ε3/2 are orbital energies of 5d5/2 and 5d3/2 states of

to splitting between components of the 3∆ and 3Π states
on 1269 and 635 cm−1, correspondingly. It is in a good
agreement with the splitting of the 3∆ state calculated
in Table I but not with the 3Π one because of the SO
interaction with closely lying 1∆ and 1Π states.

The calculated Ak and Wd for the 3∆1 state are pre-
sented in Table II. In opposite to Ak[F], Ak[Hf] and Wd
are not seriously changed when the outer core electrons
are included into calculation. Such behavior of Ak[F] is
explained by the fact that ﬂuorine can be considered with
good accuracy as a closed shell subsystem (thus having
0) in the 3∆ state, i.e. large compensation from
Ak[F]
orbitals with diﬀerent projections of total electronic mo-
mentum for Ak[F] takes place. Therefore, even small per-
turbation can seriously change the Ak[F] value. Calcu-
lated Wd is large and comparable with the corresponding
value for the a(1) state of the PbO molecule [27]. Our
value in 1.34 times larger (diﬀerent sign is, probably, con-
nected with inconsistence of the used conventions) than
value obtained in the paper [14] in scalar-relativistic cal-
culations. Our rather crude estimate of the 3∆1 lifetime
for the 3∆1
1Σ+ transition is about 1/2 sec. This value
is diﬃcult for accurate calculations because of small ab-
solute values of both transition energies and, particularly,
transition dipole moments between those states whereas
absolute errors are similar to those for other transitions.

Using a single trapped barium ion we have developed an rf spectroscopy technique to measure the
ratio of the oﬀ-resonant vector ac Stark eﬀect (or light shift) in the 6S1/2 and 5D3/2 states to 0.1%
precision. We ﬁnd R ≡ ∆S/∆D = −11.494(13) at 514.531 nm where ∆S,D are the light shifts of the
m = ±1/2 splittings due to circularly polarized light. Comparison of this result with an ab initio
calculation of R would yield a new test of atomic theory. By appropriately choosing an oﬀ-resonant
light shift wavelength one can emphasize the contribution of one or a few dipole matrix elements
and precisely determine their values.

PACS numbers: 32.70.Cs, 32.60.+i, 32.80.Pj

Experimental tests of atomic theory often involve
the measurement of atomic state lifetimes, oscillator
strengths, polarizabilities [1], and other properties which
depend directly on atomic dipole matrix elements. Ab-
solute measurements of these quantities can be diﬃcult.
Another approach [2] is to make high precision measure-
ments of properties which can be directly calculated using
modern atomic theory techniques and depend on ratios
of atomic matrix elements. Here we report a 0.1% mea-
surement of the ratio R of the ac Stark eﬀect (or light
shift) in the 6S1/2 and 5D3/2 states of a singly-ionized
barium ion, iso-electronic to the well-studied alkali atom
Cs. Comparison of this result with an ab initio calcula-
tion of R would yield a new test of atomic theory.

Since R is expressible as ratios of matrix elements
(shown below), this measurement also establishes a sum
rule relating the barium matrix elements known to ∼
1% or better (i.e. h6S1/2||r||6P1/2,3/2i) to matrix ele-
ments with about ten times worse experimental precision
[3, 4, 5, 6]. One of the latter, h5D3/2||r||6P1/2i, is cru-
cial for a proposed atomic parity violation experiment
[7, 8, 9]. In our scheme, a particular matrix element can
be studied by choosing a light shift wavelength close to
the corresponding dipole transition so that other contri-
butions remain small. The technique is generalizable to
other trapped ion species with metastable states.

To second order in perturbation theory an oﬀ-resonant
light beam of intensity I, frequency ω, and polarization
ˆǫ causes a frequency shift ∆k,m in atomic level |k, mi of:

∆k,m = 2παI X

k′,m′,±ω

|hk, m|ˆǫ · r|k′, m′i|2
Wk′ − Wk ± ~ω

,

where α is the ﬁne-structure constant, k stands for atomic
quantum numbers nlj, and Wk is the unperturbed en-
ergy of level k. Though it is diﬃcult to measure the
light intensity at the site of a trapped ion, I cancels in
a measured ratio of light shifts. The light shift due to
circularly polarized oﬀ-resonant light acts eﬀectively as a
magnetic ﬁeld pointing along the direction of light prop-
agation [12, 13]. In our case, a laboratory magnetic ﬁeld

FIG. 1: This energy level diagram of 138Ba+ shows the op-
tical transitions and magnetic spin resonances ωS and ωD of
interest in this work as well as the electric-dipole forbidden
2051 nm transition important to a proposed atomic parity vi-
olation experiment. Note the several second lifetimes [10, 11]
of the metastable 5D3/2 and 5D5/2 states. The inset cartoon
of a Paul-Straubel [16] trap and ion shows the alignment of
the lasers and rf spin-ﬂip ﬁeld ~B1 with respect to the static
magnetic ﬁeld ~B0. The 4F5/2 state, while relevant to the
measurement, is not shown.

(B0 ∼ 2.5 G) is aligned with the light shift beam. There-
fore, if the same magnetic sublevels in two atomic states
are used, there is only second order dependence of the ra-
tio on polarization errors and misalignment of the light
shift beam with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld.

By employing an rf spectroscopy technique [14] that
features the metastable 5D5/2 “shelving” state as a
means of detecting spin ﬂips, we make measurements of
the m = −1/2 ↔ +1/2 splittings ωS and ωD in the 6S1/2
and 5D3/2 states of a single 138Ba+ ion without any light
shift, which we interleave with measurements of the split-
tings, ωLS

shift beam. The measured ratio of light shifts R is then

Separately plotted are the h5D3/2||r||6P1/2,3/2i contributions
to the shift in the 5D3/2 state (thin solid) which dominates
in the visible spectrum and the h5D3/2||r||4F5/2i contribu-
tion (thin dashed). The calculation includes electric dipole
coupling with the 6P1/2, 6P3/2, 7P1/2, 7P3/2 [3, 4, 5, 6] and
4F5/2 [15] states.

Here fs and fd are known angular factors. The sums
extend over continuum states. Core eﬀects and higher-
order terms are signiﬁcant at or above the ∼ 1% level
and must be included in a precision atomic calculation.
Because the light shift of level k due to level k′ de-
pends inversely on the detuning between the applied light
frequency and the splitting between k and k′, choos-
ing a light shift frequency ω close to an allowed dipole
resonance will make one or a few terms of the sum in
Eq. (3) dominate. For instance, the contributions of the
h6S1/2||r||6P1/2,3/2i and h5D3/2||r||6P1/2,3/2i terms dom-
inate the shifts ∆S and ∆D for most visible wavelengths
as shown in Figure 2.

We trap a single 138Ba+ ion by applying several
hundred volts of 10 MHz rf to a twisted wire Paul-
Straubel [16] trap. We cool the ion to the Lamb-Dicke
regime on the 493 nm 6S1/2 ↔ 6P1/2 transition using
a frequency doubled 986 nm diode laser while also ap-
plying a 650 nm beam which prevents pumping to the
long-lived 5D3/2 state. This repump laser is frequency
modulated at 2 kHz to a depth of ∼100 MHz to frequency
lock it opto-galvanically to a barium hollow cathode lamp

FIG. 3: Example of a 5D3/2 resonance scan. The probability
that the ion is “shelved” in the metastable 5D5/2 state is
correlated to whether an rf π-pulse was on resonance with
the 5D3/2 m = −1/2 ↔ +1/2 splitting. Here, homogenous
broadening dominates the line width and coherent features
unique to this four state system are visible.

and to eliminate coherent eﬀects which otherwise appear
on the cooling transition [17]. A static magnetic ﬁeld
aligned along both lasers splits the magnetic sublevels
by a few MHz and eliminates dark states [18]. High in-
tensity ﬁltered light-emitting diodes perform shelving to
and deshelving from the 5D5/2 state with rates &10 Hz.
Because earlier reports [9, 14] gave details of the rf
spectroscopy measurement in the 6S1/2 state and since
an important systematic eﬀect arises from the 5D3/2 res-
onance line shape, we describe the measurement in the
5D3/2 state in detail here. The red repumping beam
is aligned with the magnetic ﬁeld. Making it left cir-
cular polarized (σ−) with an electro-optic modulator
causes optical pumping into a state in the lower mani-
fold (m = −1/2, −3/2) of 5D3/2. With the cooling and
repumping beams turned oﬀ, a properly timed rf pulse
resonant with the m = −1/2 ↔ +1/2 splitting moves the
ion to the upper (m = +1/2, +3/2) manifold with mod-
erate probability. We must now read out the occurrence
of this rf spin-ﬂip. Applying a pulse of σ− repumping
light to cause a decay to 6S1/2 followed by a pulse of
shelving (455 nm, 6S1/2 → 6P3/2) light transfers an ion
in the upper 5D3/2 manifold to the 5D5/2 shelving state
while leaving the lower manifold population untouched.
Now detection of 493 nm ﬂuorescence upon reapplica-
tion of the cooling and repumping beams is correlated to
whether the ion is in the 5D5/2 shelved state and hence
whether the rf pulse was on resonance. By repeating the
measurement to gather statistics at several spin-ﬂip radio
frequencies one obtains resonance line shapes as shown
in Figure 3.

The size and shape of the coherent features (e.g. side-
bands) of the line depend primarily on the initial con-
dition of the ion; that is, with what probability a it is
prepared via optical pumping into the m = −1/2 state
instead of m = −3/2.
In principle a ≤ 0.8 because
of diﬀerential pumping rates to 6P1/2; lower values will
result from laser/magnetic ﬁeld misalignment and poor

FIG. 4: The most important systematic eﬀect arises from
distortions in the 5D3/2 resonance line shape caused by the
tensor piece of the light shift. The vertical lines indicate the
simulated light shift values ∆D in units of ΩD. Shown in (a)
and (c) are simulated line shapes for ∆D/ΩD = 5 while (b)
and (d) show ∆D/ΩD = 20. The initial conditions for (a)

red laser polarization quality. By ﬁtting resonances us-
ing the optical Bloch equations we have determined that
0.5 ≤ a ≤ 0.78 are typically observed values.

We chose the convenient 514.531 nm (air wavelength)
line of an argon-ion laser as the oﬀ-resonant light shifting
beam. Approximately 1 W of laser light travels through
an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) used for intensity
stabilization and couples into a single-mode polarization-
maintaining ﬁber after which are circular-polarizing op-
tics and the intensity stabilization photodiode. The use
of the AOM, ﬁber, polarization optics, and sensor in this
order translates laser pointing and polarization noise into
intensity noise which is nulled by the AOM servo to much
better than 0.1% over a dc-10 kHz bandwidth.

A single data run consists of four interleaved mea-
surements: 6S1/2 and 5D3/2 Zeeman resonances with
and without the application of a light shift beam. The
four resonances are typically limited by inhomogeneous
broadening due to small ﬂuctuations in the magnetic ﬁeld
or light shift beam intensity, pointing, and polarization.
They are therefore ﬁt to Gaussians to determine the res-
onance centers and uncertainties. We assign statistical
errors to each light shift ratio measurement by propa-
gating these uncertainties through Eq. (2). About two
hours is required to reach a statistical precision of 1%
per measurement.

Systematic eﬀects common to shifted and unshifted
resonance measurements completely cancel. Many other
systematic eﬀects are eliminated because we interleave

FIG. 5: Observed light shift ratios R deﬁned in Eq. (2) are
shown against the most signiﬁcant systematic parameter: the
ratio of measured light shift in the 5D3/2 state and the spin-
ﬂip Rabi-frequency ∆D/ΩD. For low values of this ratio, the
tensor light shift distorts the D-resonance line shape leading
to systematic shifts of either sign and variable size. If only
data with ∆D/ΩD > 20 are considered (putting any potential
systematic below 0.1% in our models) the straight line ﬁt

resonance measurements in both the 6S1/2 and 5D3/2
states and are only concerned with the ratio of their
shifts. Eﬀects that remain are discussed below; they
fall into the categories of line shape eﬀects, alignment
and polarization errors, ion displacements, magnetic ﬁeld
variations, coupling to the trapping rf ﬁeld, and spectral
purity of the light shift laser.

The most signiﬁcant systematic eﬀect is caused by the
line shape of the light shifted 5D3/2 resonance. J > 1/2
in this state, so a tensor component to the light shift
makes the outer splittings m = −3/2 ↔ −1/2 and
m = +1/2 ↔ +3/2 diﬀerent from the splitting of inter-
est m = −1/2 ↔ +1/2. This has been observed to cause
distortions in the 5D3/2 resonance line shapes when the
light shifts ∆D are comparable to the spin-ﬂip Rabi os-
cillation frequency ΩD. The distortion near the center
of the line decreases markedly with increasing ∆D/ΩD
as illustrated in Figure 4. The distortion is worse at
higher a values and at light shift wavelengths with sig-
niﬁcant h5D3/2||r||4F5/2i contribution. The sign of the
line-center error changes with reversing the light shift
beam polarization relative to the magnetic ﬁeld, or with
initially preparing the ion in the opposite 5D3/2 man-
ifold. We conﬁrmed these reversals, which explain the
increased scatter seen in data with low ∆D/ΩD (see Fig-
ure 5) since the sign of the eﬀect was not controlled. We
minimize this systematic by only including data in the ﬁ-
nal analysis for which ∆D ≫ ΩD. By choosing the cut-oﬀ
∆D/ΩD > 20 our models suggest the average remaining
eﬀect is less than 0.05%.

A misalignment α of the light shift beam from the mag-
netic ﬁeld decreases observed light shifts and alters the
measured R. Throughout the experiment the light shifts

∆S and ∆D are kept small with respect to the splittings
ωS and ωD so that these errors are quadratic in α and
multiplied by factors ∆S/ωS or ∆D/ωD. For a typical
data run, ∆S ∼ 100 kHz at ωS ∼ 6.8 MHz, we estimate
an α = 10◦ misalignment causes < 0.1% change in R
while independently we have constrained α < 5◦. Errors
in the light shift laser polarization couple to misalign-
ments to produce systematic shifts in the 5D3/2 splitting
due to the tensor light shift. These are kept well below
0.1% by maintaining a measured polarization quality of
σ > 0.95 in addition to the above misalignment bounds.
The pseudo-potential due to the rf trap completely
overpowers the expected dipole force experienced by an
ion in a gradient of the light shift beam (P < 100 mW,
with a ∼ 20 µm spot). We have ruled out any eﬀects
which might displace the ion in a beam gradient by tak-
ing some data with the ion near the edge of the beam
to set bounds and taking the majority of data with the
ion centered in the beam spot to ±5%. We detected no
dependence of ∆S on the Rabi spin-ﬂip frequency ΩS
which would imply displacement of the ion caused by the
spin-ﬂip rf. Changes in the magnetic ﬁeld at the site
of the ion accompanying the application of the light shift
laser, for instance due to the activation of a shutter, have
been ruled out at the 1 Hz level by running the experi-
ment with the light shift laser turned oﬀ and seeing no
anomalous shift.

Capacitive pickup of the trap rf creates magnetic ﬁelds
that shift (like the Bloch-Siegert eﬀect) the 6S1/2 and
5D3/2 resonances up to a few kHz. This eﬀect is cal-
ibrated for each run by comparing the measured ratio
of g-factors ωS/ωD against its well measured value [19].
Most of this eﬀect is common to both shifted and un-
shifted resonances since ∆S ≪ ωS and ∆D ≪ ωD by
design; we apply corrections, no higher than 0.06% in
any single run, to account for the net eﬀect on R.

Commercial wavemeters conﬁrmed no signiﬁcant wave-
length drift with occasional small changes in argon-ion
laser tube pressure. Background argon-ion ﬂuorescence
coupled via the optical ﬁber to the ion was measured be-
low 20µW which can only account for sub-Hz light shifts.
All data are shown in Figure 5. By cutting data
with ∆D/ΩD < 20 to minimize systematics as discussed
above we obtain the result R = −11.494(13), where
the quoted uncertainty includes a statistical contribu-
tion of σstat. = 0.008 and total systematic uncertainty
σsyst. = 0.010 added in quadrature. This agrees with a
theoretical estimate of Rest. = 11(1) obtained using pub-
lished matrix elements and uncertainties (see Figure 2
note). An ab initio calculation of R would provide an
exacting test of atomic theory.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the measure-
ment of oﬀ-resonant light shifts in single trapped ions
via electron shelving is a viable technique for precisely
testing atomic theory. Future plans include perform-
ing this measurement again at a diﬀerent oﬀ-resonant

4

wavelength in order to untangle h5D3/2||r||6P1/2,3/2i and
h5D3/2||r||4F5/2i contributions in Eq. (3). The appara-
tus might also be used to measure the 5D3/2 electronic
quadrupole moment via a strong dc potential applied
to the trap ring [20]. Such quadrupole Stark shifts im-
pact single ion frequency standards [21] and merit further
study in a calculable system such as 138Ba+.

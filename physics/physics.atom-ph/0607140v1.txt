We point out that theories describing s-wave collisions of bosonic atoms conﬁned in one- or two-dimensional
geometries can be extended to much tighter conﬁnements than previously thought. This is achieved by replacing
the scattering length by an energy-dependent scattering length which was already introduced for the calculation
of energy levels under 3D conﬁnement. This replacement accurately predicts the position of conﬁnement-
induced resonances in strongly conﬁned geometries.

Many experiments investigating the properties of cold
atomic gases and Bose-Einstein condensates are now per-
formed in tightly conﬁning traps, such as tight optical lat-
tices, leading to systems of reduced dimensionality [1, 2, 3,
4]. There are many uses for such conﬁnements. In spectro-
scopic measurements, they eliminate unwanted Doppler and
recoil effects [5, 6]. They can also be used to create tun-
able analogs of condensed matter systems, and give the pos-
sibility to investigate remarkable many-body regimes in low
dimensions such as the Tonks-Girardeau gas [7, 8, 9, 10].
The theory of s-wave atomic collisions in strongly con-
ﬁned systems has been established in Refs. [7] and [11]
for 2D and 1D conﬁnement, respectively. Both predict a
conﬁnement-induced resonance of the effective 1D or 2D in-
teraction strength. These predictions rely on a description
of the atomic interaction in terms of the scattering length
only. However, in 3D conﬁned systems, it was shown that
a more reﬁned description is needed for very tight conﬁne-
ment [12, 13]. Similarly, in 2D conﬁned systems, numerical
calculations in Ref. [14] showed that the scattering length
description of Ref. [7] may be insufﬁcient. In this paper, we
present an accurate analytical description for scattering in 1D
and 2D geometries based on the ﬁndings of Refs. [13, 15].

We consider a gas of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice
and assume that there is little tunelling between the lattice
cells, so that each cell is independent. The atoms in a cell
are conﬁned by a trapping potential which will be assumed
harmonic (which is true near the centre of the cell). Let us
consider a pair of atoms in such a cell. For a harmonic po-
tential, the centre-of-mass motion decouples from the rela-
tive motion and the stationary Schrödinger equation for the
relative motion wave function ψ(~r) reads:

~2

(cid:21)

ψ(~r) = Eψ(~r).

Here, ~r = (x, y, z) is the relative coordinate with separation
r, µ the reduced mass, U (r) the isotropic atom-atom interac-
tion potential, V (~r) the trapping potential, and E the relative
energy.

For 2D conﬁnement (tube or wave guide geometry), the
atoms are strongly conﬁned in the xy directions and (almost)
free to move in the z direction, therefore we set:

V (~r)

V2D(~r) =

µω2ρ2

where ρ =
and ~ρ is the projection of ~r on the xy
plane. For 1D conﬁnement (pancake geometry), the atoms
are strongly conﬁned in the z direction and (almost) free to
move in the xy directions:

V (~r)

V1D(~r) =

Here, ω is the trapping frequency at the centre of the cell
~/(2µω) as the typical length scale
and we deﬁne σ =

The wave function ψ can be expanded in spherical par-
tial waves labelled by ℓ and mℓ. Since the trapping poten-
tial V (~r) and the interaction potential U (r) are invariant un-
~r, only partial waves of
der the parity transformation ~r
the same parity are coupled. Furthermore, we assume that
the interaction potential U (r) has a spatial range r0, beyond
which its effect is negligible. Consequently, for sufﬁciently
= 0 partial waves are repelled by the
cold collisions, all ℓ
centrifugal barrier beyond r0, so that only the s partial wave
(ℓ = 0) is directly affected by the interaction. As a result, we
will only need to consider even parity waves in the system to
determine its scattering properties. For a typical atomic in-
C6/r6 van der Waals poten-
teraction, which drops off as a
1/4

[16], as long
tial, the range r0 is close to β6 =
as the collisional energy lies in Wigner’s threshold regime.
Typical values for β6 range from 2 nm to 5 nm. We will
show that as long as σ & r0 a simple analytical theory can
be derived without knowing the detailed shape of U (r). This
relies on the fact that the solution ψ of Eq. (1) has analytic
approximations in two overlapping spatial regions.

The ﬁrst region is the noninteracting region where r > r0
- see Figs. 1a and 1a’. The wave function ψ(~r) then satisﬁes
Eq. (1) with U (r) = 0. Consequently, any scattering solution
ψ(~r) is composed of an incident wave and a scattered wave
proportional to the Green’s function G(~r, ~r′) of the system
for U (r) = 0. A plane wave basis is used for the incident
wave. Namely, for 2D conﬁnement, one has:

the solution to the free-space scattering problem at energy E is represented as a thin black line. For r > β6 it has the asymptotic form
corresponding to Eq. (4). The thick black line represents the 1D or 2D wave function in the noninteracting region obtained from Eq. (2) or
(3). It is determined by a matching procedure with the free-space scattering wave function, as explained in the text. The previous theories
[7, 11] were based on a matching with the solution to free-space scattering at zero energy (dotted line), which has the asymptotic form
corresponding to Eq. (5) for r > β6. The resulting noninteracting 1D and 2D wave functions are represented by thick grey lines. They do
not connect to the zero-energy wave function for the considered conﬁnements. The lengths β6, a and 1/k are indicated by arrows.

result, it is composed of several partial waves, where only

pelled by the centrifugal barrier, there is a subregion where

The collisional energy E is always larger than the zero-
point energy of the trap (~ω for tubes, and 1
~ω for pan-
2
cakes), which can be relatively large for strong conﬁnement.
The corresponding collisional momentum ~k in the 3D col-
lision core is therefore at least ~/σ for tubes and ~/(√2σ)
for pancakes. On the other hand, in the noninteracting re-
gion the momenta ~qnm or ~qn along the free direction(s)
may be very small as they are determined by the tempera-
ture or a weak conﬁnement in these directions. When the
momenta in the free direction(s) are much smaller than the
k),
momentum in the tight direction(s) (qmn ≪
we can regard the wave function as an effectively low-energy
2D or 1D scattering wave function which at short separations
connects to the higher-energy 3D collision core. In the fol-
lowing, we will consider the quasi-1D or quasi-2D regimes
where the incoming wave is in the ground state (n = m = 0
or n = 0) of the tight direction.

The noninteracting region and the 3D collision core re-
gion overlap as shown in Figs. 1c and 1c’. In this region,
the wave function ψ is proportional to the physical solution
to the 3D free-space scattering problem, which is dominated
by the s-wave component, since it is in the 3D collision core.
Moreover, as it is also in the noninteracting region, this so-
lution has reached its asymptotic form. Retaining only the
s-wave component, we can write:

Refs. [13, 15]. The next partial wave (ℓ = 2) is propotional
to the spherical Bessel function j2(kr) and thus contributes
to order r2 in an asymptotic expansion near r = 0. The
expression (4) is therefore valid up to order r.

The energy-dependent scattering length a(k) contains all
the effects of the interaction on the wave function in the over-
lapping region, and for any collisional energy E. For moder-
ately tight traps σ
r0 leading to small collisional energies,
there is a range of r for which Eq. (4) simpliﬁes to:

The essence of the method used in Ref. [7] and [17] is
to assume that σ
r0 and match the 3D collision core ex-
pression (5) with the noninteracting expressions (2) and (3),
respectively, in the region where they overlap. (In Ref. [7],
this is achieved by use of a 3D Fermi pseudopotential [19]).
By performing the matching procedure up to zeroth order in
the asymptotic expansion near r = 0, they obtain the factor
η and the amplitudes A00 or A0, and deduce the effective 1D
and 2D interaction strengths [7, 17]:

We stress here that the method can be extended to σ & r0
by matching the expressions (3) and (2) in the noninteract-
ing region with the expression (4) in the 3D collision core up
to ﬁrst order in r. It turns out that the resulting conditions
are formally identical to those of Refs. [7, 17], if one re-
places the scattering length a by the energy-dependent a(k)
in all the formulæ. In particular, a is replaced by a(k) in
Eqs. (6-7). This is not so surprising in view of the results
reported in Refs. [13, 15, 20, 21], which have shown the
relevance of energy-dependent scattering lengths for the ac-
curate calculation of energy levels in 3D conﬁned geome-
tries. Similar extensions of (6) and (7) were considered in
Refs. [22, 23] in order to take into account the energy de-
pendence due to a scattering resonance at low energy.
In
Ref. [23], a renormalised contact interaction was used, lead-
ing to the replacement of a by the quantity 2µ
4π~2 T (k), where
T (k) = 4π~2
2µ a(k)(1 + ika(k))−1 is the T -matrix. This com-
plex quantity equivalent to the real a(k) at low energy. Here
we focus on the energy dependence for strong conﬁnement
even in the absence of any resonance.

In Fig. (2) we illustrate the matching of the wave functions
in the case of a very tight trap and a van der Waals interaction

Figure 3: The 1D interaction strength (left panel) and the 2D interaction strength (right panel) in dimensionless units as a function of the
ratio of the 3D scattering length a over the conﬁnement dimension σ (a is varied and σ is ﬁxed). As in Fig. (2), σ = 1.95 β6 in left panel
and σ = 1.18 β6 in the right panel. The dots are obtained by numerically solving the problem of two atoms interacting through a Lennard-
Jones potential in a 3D cylindrically-symmetric trap; dots in the left panel (tube geometry) were taken from Ref. [14] and conﬁrmed by us,
while we calculated the dots in right panel (pancake geometry) using the adaptive grid reﬁnement method of Ref. [18]. The dashed curves
correspond to the formulæ (6) and (7) with the zero-energy scattering length a, and the solid curves corresponds to the same formulæ using
the energy-dependent scattering length a(k) instead of a. Here, a(k) has been calculated in the effective range approximation, Eq. (8),
which is valid almost everywhere except for small positive scattering lengths where the approximation causes a spurious resonance.

is highly oscillatory for r < β6, and has the asymptotic form
(4) for r > β6) and the noninteracting wave function along
either the z or ρ directions. The coefﬁcients An or Amn
and η of these wave functions have been determined so that
their asymptotic expansion match to ﬁrst order. As as a re-
sult, the two functions differ only by a second-order error,
√6/k,
and therefore nearly agree where r > β6 and r
as long as kβ6 . 1. For extreme conﬁnements such that
kβ6 > 1, the second-order error becomes too large and a
more avanced theory is needed. For comparison, we also in-
dicated the k = 0 solution to the free-space problem (which
has the asymptotic form (5)) and the corresponding noninter-
acting wave function, which have been matched up to zeroth
order, as was done in the original theories [7, 17]. The two
functions disagree markedly for r > β6, showing that the
replacement a
a(k) is essential for a proper matching in
→
a very tight trap.

≪

An interesting consequence of the extended theory is that
if the conﬁnement is strong enough, the collisional energy
in the 3D collision core can probe the energy-dependence of
a(k). For a standard contact potential [19], a(k) is constant
and equal to a. However, a more realistic a(k) has some
energy dependence. For instance, in the effective range ap-
proximation, a(k) has the resonant form:

where re is the effective range of the potential [24]. This
approximation works well for short-range interactions with a

Waals interactions [26]. The interest of Eqs. (8) and (9) is
that they give a simple two-parameter description of the col-
lisions for a wide range of energies.

To illustrate these ideas, we calculated the 1D interac-
tion strength g1D for a van der Waals interaction consistent
with the Lennard-Jones parameters of the numerical calcula-
tion reported in Ref. [14]. The authors observed a differ-
ence between their numerical calculation and the analytic
formula (6) where a is taken as the zero-energy scattering
length. They suggested that this difference comes the fact
that the conﬁnement-induced resonance in g1D results from
a Feshbach resonance with a trap bound state, whose bind-
ing energy is not predicted accurately by a pseudopotential
based only on the scattering length. As a result, the for-
mula (6) does not predict the resonance at the right location.
However, we show in Fig. (3) that the same formula used in
conjunction with the replacement a
a(k) in the effective
range approximation reproduces the numerical calculations
very well. This is because the effective range approxima-
tion is able to reproduce the binding energy of the last bound
state accurately. The only region where the effective range
approximation fails is for small scattering lengths a
β6,
where it predicts a spurious resonance, as visible in Fig. (3).

→

≪

We also calculated the 2D interaction strength and
checked that a similar situation occurs in the pancake con-
ﬁguration. Using the adaptive grid reﬁnement method of
Ref. [18], we solved the Schrödinger equation (1) for a
C6
Lennard-Jones interaction U (r) = C12
r6 and a cylin-
r12
drical harmonic trap. The tight pancake limit is obtained by
setting the ratio of axial and radial frequencies to 400 (thus
leading to a spatial aspect ratio of 1/20), and the tight con-
ﬁnement scale is set to σ = 1.18 β6. The parameter C12
is adjusted to set the number of bound states supported by
the interaction and the scattering length. From this calcula-
tion, we obtained the eigenenergies and then used Eq. (21) of
Ref. [27] to extract the 2D scattering length. We found that it

−

shows very little dependence on the number of bound states,
which can be as low as 2, saving computational efforts. Us-
ing Eq. (7) of Ref. [17] (or Eq. (15) of Ref. [28]), we could
then relate the 2D scattering length to the interaction strength
g2D for any q0 - we chose a q0 given by the zero-point mo-
mentum in the weak direction. Figure (3) compares this nu-
merical g2D with the analytical formula (6) for the same q0.
Again, the position of the conﬁnement-induced resonance
for negative scattering lengths [11] is correctly predicted by
(6) provided the energy-dependent scattering length is used.
As previously, the effective range approximation works well,
except for small scattering lengths. These results also sug-
gest that the observation of the resonance may provide useful
information about the effective range of the interaction.

In summary, we have shown that the effective 1D or 2D
interactions of ultracold bosons in strongly conﬁned systems
are governed by 3D collisions at a relatively high energy
determined by the conﬁnement. The effect of these high-
energy collisions can be well described by a single quantity,
the energy-dependent scattering length, up to extremely tight
conﬁnements. For van der Waals interactions, this quantity
itself can be expressed in the effective range approximation
in terms of the zero-energy scattering length and the van
der Waals length. This parametrized energy-dependent scat-
tering length leads to an accurate analytic prediction of the
conﬁnement-induced resonance both in 1D and 2D conﬁne-
ments.

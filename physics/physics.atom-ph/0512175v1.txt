Abstract. A many-body theory approach to the calculation of gamma spectra of
positron annihilation on many-electron atoms is developed. We evaluate the ﬁrst-order
correlation correction to the annihilation vertex and perform numerical calculations for
the noble gas atoms. Extrapolation with respect to the maximal orbital momentum of
the intermediate electron and positron states is used to achieve convergence. The
inclusion of correlation corrections improves agreement with experimental gamma
spectra.

Many-body theory of positron annihilation spectra

1. Introduction

The main aim of our paper is to develop a many-body theory approach to the calculation
of gamma spectra from positron-atom annihilation.

Positron annihilation has been an important tool for studying electronic and atomic
structure of solids for over half-a-century. Its history can be traced from the ﬁrst review
of the theory of positron annihilation in solids by Ferrel (1956) to a more recent work
by Puska and Nieminen (1994). Positron lifetimes and spectra of annihilation gamma
quanta contain information about the structure and composition of bulk materials and
surfaces, presence and concentration of defects and voids or pores, and their sizes, and
electron momentum distribution. Interpretation of positron annihilation data requires
good theoretical understanding of the process. Many-body theory was the ﬁrst method
used to determine positron annihilation rates in metals (Kahana 1963, Carbotte 1967).
In particular, it was successful in explaining large enhancement factors that increase the
annihilation rates above that obtained in the noninteracting electron gas approximation
(see also Arponen and Pajanne 1979).

In the 1990’s measurements of gamma-ray spectra from positron annihilation on
atoms and molecules in the gas phase became possible (Tang et al 1992, Coleman
et al 1994). For He the experiment showed excellent agreement with the calculated
spectrum obtained from an elaborate variational positron-He wavefunction (Van Reeth
et al 1996). This work also revealed sizeable deviations of the shape spectrum from a
Gaussian, which is often used as an approximation. For noble gas atoms of Ar, Kr and
Xe, a careful study of the shape of the 511-keV gamma-ray line provided an estimate of
the contribution of positron annihilation with inner-shell electrons (Iwata et al 1997a).
A large systematic study was conducted for a variety of inorganic molecules, alkanes,
alkenes, aromatics and perﬂuorinated and partially ﬂuorinated hydrocarbons (Iwata et
al 1997b). In particular, this work determined the relative probability of annihilation
on the ﬂuorine atoms and on the C–H bonds for partially ﬂuorinated hydrocarbons.
Such information is important for achieving better understanding of very large positron
annihilation rates on polyatomic molecules (see, e.g., Surko et al 2005).

On the theory side, much progress in understanding the interaction of low-energy
positrons with many-electron atoms has been obtained by using many-body theory.
Its application to positron-atom collisions was pioneered by Amusia et al (1976) who
considered positron scattering from He. Subsequently, the eﬀect of virtual positronium
(Ps) formation on positron-atom interaction was investigated for heavier noble gas
atoms (Dzuba et al 1993, 1996). These works showed that virtual Ps formation gives
a large contribution to the positron-atom attraction
It leads to the emergence of

scattering and annihilation for noble gas atoms (McEachran et al 1980 and references therein).
In
that approximation the positron was treated as a heavy particle, and the strength of the positron-atom
polarization potential was overestimated, making up for the complete neglect of virtual Ps formation.

alters the picture of low-energy positron-atom scattering (Gribakin and King 1996).
These papers employed an approximate method of accounting for virtual Ps formation.
Recently, a consistent many-body theory approach has been developed. It is based on
the summation of the electron-positron ladder diagram series (Ludlow 2003, Gribakin
and Ludlow 2004).
Its contribution is especially prominent in the calculation of
the annihilation rate. These and earlier calculations (Dzuba et al 1993, 1996) have
demonstrated that electron-positron correlation eﬀects can enhance the positron-atom
annihilation rate as much as 103 times.

In the paper by Iwata et al (1997a), the fraction of annihilation with inner-shell
electrons was derived by ﬁtting the experimental data with a linear combination of the
gamma spectra for the valence and inner shells. These spectra were calculated in the
simplest approximation, by using the positron wavefunction in the static ﬁeld of the
atom.
In spite of a complete neglect of electron-positron correlations, the shapes of
the measured gamma spectra were described reasonably well. On the other hand, some
discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental spectra were obvious, adding
uncertainty to the estimates of the inner-shell annihilation fractions. For example, the
data for Ar was compatible with a zero contribution of annihilation with 2s and 2p
electrons.

Since correlations eﬀects play such a large role in positron-atom interactions, they
must be included in the proper theory of annihilation gamma spectra. In what follows we
brieﬂy recount the main facts and formulae concerning positron annihilation and gamma
spectra using the formalism of creation-destruction operators (section 2). We then
proceed to derive the many-body diagrammatic expansion of the annihilation amplitude,
and consider the signiﬁcance of various terms and their relation to the total annihilation
rate (section 3). In section 4, expressions for the 0th and 1st-order contributions are
reduced to products of radial matrix elements, which can be evaluated numerically.
Section 5 reports the results of such calculations for the noble gas atoms, which conﬁrm
that the correlation corrections to the annihilation amplitude have a marked eﬀect on
the gamma spectra. We also demonstrate the importance of extrapolation over the
maximal orbital angular momentum of the intermediate electron and positron states.
In the Appendix, expressions for the annihilation amplitudes involving many-particle
wavefunctions in coordinate space are given.

2. Basic Theory

2.1. Annihilation operator

Due to the conservation of momentum, annihilation of an electron-positron pair
must lead to the emission of at least two photons
In fact, according to quantum
.
§
electrodynamics (QED), annihilation into two photons is possible only if the total spin

When this process occurs in an external ﬁeld, e.g., when the electron is bound in an atom, annihilation
§
into a single quantum is also possible. However, its probability is small, see, e.g., Johnson et al 1964.

.

S of the pair is zero (Berestetskii et al 1982). For S = 1 the annihilation results in the
emission of three photons
k

In QED the process of electron-positron annihilation is described by the 2nd or
3rd-order diagram, depending on the number of photons emitted (Berestetskii et al
2mc2, and have large
1982). The photons carry away the energy of the particles,
mc, where m is the electron mass, and c is the speed of light. Intermediate
momenta
electron/positron states in the QED diagrams have similar momenta. They are much
larger than the typical momenta of valence and inner-shell atomic electrons (with the
exception of 1s electrons in heavy atoms with Z
100), or the positron momentum
in a typical experiment
. As a result, the annihilation amplitude is independent of
the electron and positron momenta. Hence, the eﬀective operator for annihilation into
gamma quanta with the total momentum P is proportional to

where ˆak1 (ˆbk2) is the destruction operator of the electron (positron) with momentum
k1 (k2), and the δ-function ensures momentum conservation, P = k1 + k2 (Ferrell
1956). Using electron and positron destruction operators ˆψ(r) and ˆϕ(r) in the coordinate

where V is the normalization volume, the annihilation operator (1) can be re-written as
(Ferrell 1956, Chang Lee 1957)

This equation shows that the annihilation of a nonrelativistic electron-positron pair
occurs when the particles are at the same point. Physically, this can be explained using
the uncertainty principle.
Indeed, the spatial separation between the points where
the photons are produced is about ¯h/mc. This is much smaller than the Bohr radius
a0 = ¯h2/me2, i.e. the typical atomic size, or the de Broglie wavelength of the particles
involved (c = 137 in atomic units, where ¯h = m =

= 1).

In equations (1) and (4) electron and positron spin indices have been suppressed.
The operator can be used in this form if the total spin of the electron subsystem is
zero.
In this case the annihilation rate is equal to that averaged over the positron
spin. The rate of annihilation into photons with the total momentum P is given by the
squared modulus of the transition amplitude of operator (4). The total annihilation rate
is obtained by integration over d3P/(2π)3 and summation over the ﬁnal states of the

For S = 0 annihilation into 2, 4, . . . photons is possible, while for S = 1 the number of photons must

be odd (3, 5, . . .). In both cases the process with the smallest number of photons dominates.

In positron annihilation with matter, even if the initial positron is fast, it quickly loses energy due

to inelastic ionizing collisions, and most of the annihilation events involve slow positrons.

system. The correct absolute magnitude of the 2-photon and 3-photon annihilation rates
can be determined by comparison with the spin-averaged positronium annihilation rates
(Berestetskii et al 1982). In the ﬁrst case the squared amplitude must be multiplied by
πr2
0αc, where r0 = e2/mc2 is the classical
electron radius, and α = e2/¯hc is the ﬁne structure constant. This shows that 3-photon
annihilation is about 103 times slower than 2-photon annihilation, and can often be
neglected.

ACAR one measures the small angle Θ between the direction of one photon and the
plane containing the other photon+. If the direction perpendicular to the plane is x,
then Θ = Px/mc. Given that the distributions of Px, Py and Pz are identical (in an
isotropic system), one obtains the distribution of Θ from w(ǫ) by a simple change of
variable, Θ = 2ǫ/mc2.

When a low-energy positron annihilates with a bound electron whose energy is εn,
the centre of the photon spectrum is shifted by εn/2 relative to mc2. The width of
the two-photon momentum distribution is determined by the typical momenta of the

If one neglects the interaction between the positron and the atom and writes the

the actual number of electrons (see, e.g., Surko et al 2005). Repulsion from the nucleus
prevents the positron from penetrating into the atom, suppressing the probability of
its annihilation with the inner electrons. On the other hand, the long-range positron-
atom attraction increases the positron density near the atom, making Zeﬀ larger. The
Coulomb attraction within the annihilating electron-positron pair increases Zeﬀ further
(Dzuba et al 1996, Gribakin and Ludlow 2004).

Note that the rate (14) is related to the positron-atom annihilation cross section

the other hand, equation (15) shows that Zeﬀ has the form of a transition amplitude

can be developed (Dzuba et al 1993).

3.1. Bases and building blocks

When studying positron-atom interactions by many-body theory methods,
it is
convenient to use the bases of electron and positron states of the Hartree-Fock
Hamiltonian of the ground-state atom. Denoting the corresponding electron (positron)
wavefunctions and destruction operators by ψµ (ϕν) and ˆaµ (ˆbν), respectively, we have:

ˆψ(r) =

ψµ(r)ˆaµ,

ˆϕ(r) =

The second form explains the presence of δ in our notation for the amplitude. Note that
the sum over µ in equation (17) contains two distinct contributions,
µ>F .
The ﬁrst sum includes the electron states occupied in the atomic ground state, i.e., those
at or below the Fermi level F (“holes”). The corresponding terms in the operator (17)
describe positron annihilation which leads to creation of a hole, as shown by diagram (a)
in ﬁgure 1. The second sum is over the electron states above the Fermi level (“particles”),
and describes positron annihilation with an excited electron, diagram (b) in ﬁgure 1.

The 2nd-order diagrams shown in ﬁgure 2 have a clear physical interpretation.
Thus, diagram A2 represents a higher-order correction to the annihilation vertex, similar
to diagram A1, with an extra interaction between the annihilating electron and positron.
Such contributions are very important because the electron-positron Coulomb attraction
strongly enhances the amplitude of ﬁnding the two particles at the same point. Diagram
A3 describes polarization of the atom by the positron. This polarization gives rise to
αde2/2r4 at large
an attractive positron-atom correlation potential which behaves as
distances, αd being the atomic dipole polarizability. It has a large eﬀect on the incident
positron (see, e.g., Dzuba et al 1993, 1996). Diagram A4 is a correlation correction to
the Hartree-Fock wavefunction of the hole. Given that the Hartree-Fock approximation
describes atomic ground state orbitals well, one may expect such corrections to be
relatively small. Finally, diagram A5 belongs to another type of vertex corrections
in which annihilation takes place in the presence of a virtual hole-particle excitation.
We will show below that this and similar diagrams can be neglected because of a
speciﬁc cancellation between the contributions of certain pairs of diagrams in the photon
momentum distribution.

in equation (15) is that of a positron incident
on the ground state atom, Zeﬀ is given by the diagrammatic expansion shown in
ﬁgure 3. Each of the diagrams contains a δ-function vertex corresponding to the contact
density operator (19) with matrix elements (20). The 0th order diagram Z0 describes
annihilation of the positron with an electron in a Hartree-Fock orbital occupied in the

included by replacing the positron state ϕε in the static ﬁeld of the atom by the positron
Dyson orbital which accounts for the positron-atom correlation potential (Dzuba et al
1996, Gribakin and Ludlow 2004).

By analogy with equations (11)–(13) and (15), the total annihilation rate is related

to the momentum distribution of the photon pairs by

Zeﬀ =

2 d3P
(2π)3 .
This means that if the terms of the series in ﬁgure 2 are multiplied by their complex
conjugates and integrated over P, the expansion for Zeﬀ from ﬁgure 3 must be recovered.

Indeed, it is easy to see, using equation (21), that the contribution of diagram A0 to the
right-hand side of equation (27) (i.e., A0 times its complex conjugate A0∗) is equal to
diagram Z0, after summation over n. Similarly, the product of diagrams A1 and A0∗,

However, some contributions that appear on the right-hand side of equation (27)
do not match any diagrams of the Zeﬀ expansion. In fact, their analytical expressions
do not even have the form that would identify them with a particular diagram. For
example, consider a product of diagrams A5 and A0∗ from ﬁgure 2,

where ε2γ = ε + εn is the energy of the two gamma quanta with respect to 2mc2, given
by the energy conservation, Eγ1 + Eγ2 = 2mc2 + ε + εn. It is easy to check that the
expression obtained upon integration of (29) over P, can not be drawn as a diagram
consistent with the diagrammatic rules. Hence, it also does not correspond to any
diagram in the expansion of Zeﬀ.

To solve this paradox, note that equation (27) contains a sum over all ﬁnal states.
Thus, besides the process shown in ﬁgure 2, where positron annihilation leads to a
single-hole state, one must consider processes with other types of ﬁnal states. Their
formation is a result of extra electron-positron or electron-electron correlations (which
means that their contribution to the total annihilation spectrum should, in general, be
smaller). The simplest of such states contains two holes and one excited electron. The
corresponding amplitude in the lowest (ﬁrst) order is shown in ﬁgure 4.

It is easy to see how these diagrams contribute to the right-hand side of
equation (27). Thus, B1 times B1∗ (integrated over P) becomes diagram Z7, B1 times

Note that this cancellation of the two anomalous contributions to the total
annihilation rate, Zeﬀ, is exact. However, it occurs even before the integration over the
momentum of the photons. This means that these contributions can be omitted when
calculating the photon momentum distribution and gamma spectrum.
In particular,
diagram A5 in ﬁgure 2 can be ignored. A similar cancellation also takes place for
other diagrams representing corrections to the annihilation vertex, in which the incident
positron line is connected with the ﬁnal-state hole by means of Coulomb interactions
and electron-hole pairs. In all of these diagrams annihilation occurs is the presence of
one or more virtual electron-hole pairs.

In principle, the photon spectra corresponding to diﬀerent ﬁnal ionic states (e.g.,
those shown in ﬁgures 2 and 4) could be considered separately.
In this case, the
contributions (29) and (30) are not added together, and do not cancel each other. In
practice, though, the total energy of the two photons or the ﬁnal state of the ion are
usually not observed. The shift of the centre of the gamma line due to the diﬀerence in
the total photon energy is negligible (as explained in section 2.2) and the cancellation
described above does take place.

4. Evaluation of the diagrams

Let us consider a positron with momentum k which collides with a closed-shell atom
in the ground state, and annihilates, creating a hole in state n. The amplitude of this
process is shown diagrammatically in ﬁgure 2. Let us denote it by Ank(P). Omitting the

5. Numerical calculations and results

In this section we present and analyse the gamma spectra obtained by using the 0th
and 1st-order terms in the amplitude, equations (37), (38) and (40), for the noble gas
atoms.

5.1. Details of the calculations

The calculation starts by determining the electron wavefunctions of the ground-state
atom in the Hartree-Fock approximation. Subsequently, sets of incident positron and

Many-body theory of positron annihilation spectra

15

intermediate electron and positron states in the ﬁeld of the ground-state atom are
generated.

In experiments, the gamma spectra of noble gases were measured with thermalized
room-temperature positrons (kBT = 25 meV). At such low energies only the positron
s wave contributes signiﬁcantly to the annihilation signal, higher partial waves being
suppressed by the centrifugal barrier. The shape of the annihilation spectrum is not
sensitive to the exact value of the positron energy (as long as it remains small), and we
calculate the spectra for the positron momentum of k = 0.05 au, corresponding to the
energy of ε = 34 meV (

The sets of intermediate positron and electron states with orbital angular momenta
l = 0–8 were calculated on a uniform mesh in momentum space, starting with k0 = 0.1
au, and increasing in steps of ∆k = 0.2 au, over 59 continuous spectrum wavefunctions.
The electron and positron wavefunctions were used to compute annihilation and
Coulomb matrix elements, and construct the annihilation amplitudes (40) for a range of
momenta P . Using those, the gamma spectra for the valence and inner subshells were
calculated from equation (37).

2kBT ).

∼

It is known that single-centre expansions of the annihilation amplitudes converge
slowly with respect to the angular momenta of the electron and positron orbitals involved
(Mitroy and Ryzhikh 1998, Mitroy et al 2002, Gribakin and Ludlow 2002). Thus,
Gribakin and Ludlow (2002) showed that the increments in the annihilation rate upon
increasing the maximal angular momentum from l
1 to l, decrease asymptotically
as (l + 1
2)−2. In application to the annihilation spectra, this means that the quantity
obtained by summing over all intermediate electron and positron states with l up to
lmax converges to the value for lmax =

where A is some constant♯. We used this relation to obtain the values of w(ǫ)
by linear extrapolation of w(ǫ)[lmax] from the last two points.

≡

The total spectra are found by adding the contributions of the diﬀerent subshells.
They can be compared with experimental data. Annihilation rates obtained by
integration of the spectra over ǫ, provide information on the relative contributions of
various subshells to the total Zeﬀ, and show the importance of the correlation correction
and extrapolation over lmax.

5.2. Results for Ar

In this section we examine in detail the results of the calculations for Ar, using it as an
example. The next section will present a summary of the results for all noble gas atoms.

lmax = 0–8. Since the spectra are symmetric, w(
ǫ) = w(ǫ), only the positive energies
are shown. The 1s subshell is not included, as its contribution is small and does not
aﬀect the results for the total spectrum.

the result accumulates with the increase of the maximal orbital angular momentum

, equation (44).

→ ∞

In the plots the lowest (thin solid) curve labelled lmax = 0 corresponds to the 0th-
order result (for 3p and 2p), or is very close to it (for 3s and 2s), since the contribution
of the intermediate states with the zero angular momentum is very small. For greater
angular momenta the contributions of successive l decrease slowly, as expected. The
spectra obtained by extrapolation to lmax → ∞
(thick solid curves) are noticeably
larger than those obtained with lmax = 8. For the two outer subshells, extrapolation
increases the spectra by about 20% at small ǫ. Details of the extrapolation procedure
are illustrated by ﬁgure 6. In agreement with equation (44), the dependence of w[lmax](ǫ)
on (lmax + 1

2)−1 is close to linear at large lmax.

Figure 5 shows that the eﬀect of electron-positron correlations described by the
1st-order correction, is strongest for the 3p and 3s subshells which have small ionization
potentials (I3p = 15.76 eV, I3s = 29.24 eV). The electrons in the inner shells are much
more strongly bound (I2p = 249 eV, I3s = 326 eV). This makes it harder for the positron
to perturb their motion, and reduces the eﬀect of correlations. Nevertheless, the 1st-

order correction leads to a noticeable increase of the annihilation signal for them as well.
The larger binding energies also mean that 2s and 2p electrons move at greater speeds
and have a broader momentum distribution. As a result, their gamma spectra are wider,
as seen in ﬁgure 5. Because of the repulsion from the nucleus, the positron wavefunction
has a weaker overlap with the inner-shell electron orbitals, and their contribution to the
positron-atom annihilation rate is much smaller than that of the valence shell.

Tables 1 and 2 quantify the eﬀect of the 1st-order correlation correction on the
shapes of the gamma spectra and annihilation rates. Table 1 gives the full widths
at half-maximum (FWHM) of the annihilation spectra for diﬀerent orbitals. It shows
that the 1st-order correction reduces the FWHM values of the spectra. This can be
explained by noticing that in the 1st-order diagram (A1) the positron annihilates with
an excited electron “pulled out” of the atom. The wavefunction of such excited electron
is less localized than the bound state wavefunction. The corresponding typical electron
momenta are lower, making for smaller Doppler shifts and a narrower gamma spectrum.
The results shown in table 2 are the breakdown of the annihilation rate Zeﬀ for the
2s, 2p, 3s and 3p subshells. Partial Zeﬀ were obtained by integration of the corresponding
spectral densities wnl(ǫ), equation (32). According to the table, extrapolation over lmax
beyond lmax = 8 increases the Zeﬀ values by about 15% for the 3s and 3p orbitals,
and by 2–3% for the n = 2 orbitals. The ﬁnal values show that adding the correlation
correction more than doubles the Zeﬀ value for the n = 3 shell, compared with the 0th-
order calculation. It also increases the contributions of the 2s and 2p subshells, by 22%
and 28%, respectively. Given their large binding energies, this is a remarkably strong
correlation eﬀect. In particular, it is much greater than their contribution of the n = 2

contribution to the dipole polarizability of Ar.

R

The size of the correlation eﬀect for the inner-shell electrons can be compared
with the enhancement factor for positron annihilation on hydrogen-like positive ions
(Novikov et al 2004). This factor is deﬁned as the ratio of Zeﬀ calculated with an
accurate correlated wavefunction to the value obtained using a product of electron and
n−(r)n+(r)dr. The latter equation would be correct
positron densities n±(r): Zeﬀ =
if the total wavefunction of the system was an uncorrelated product of the electron
and positron wavefunctions, cf. equation (15). In the many-body theory approach, the
enhancement factor can be deﬁned as the ratio of Zeﬀ calculated from the expansion in
ﬁgure 3 to the value obtained from the 0th-order diagram Z0, equation (25) (Dzuba et
al 1996, Gribakin and Ludlow 2004). This enhancement factor describes the eﬀect of
short-range electron-positron correlations (Dzuba et al 1996). For the annihilation of
s-wave positrons on the valence electrons of noble gas atoms and hydrogen, it ranges
from about 2.5 for Ne to 6 for Xe and H (Dzuba et al 1996, Gribakin and Ludlow 2004,
Ludlow 2003). According to Novikov et al (2004), the enhancement factors for B4+ and
F8+ are 1.41 and 1.20, while the electron ionization potentials in these systems are 340
and 1100 eV, respectively. The ionization potentials of the 2s and 2p subshells of Ar
are similar to the ﬁrst of these values, and the enhancement factors for Zeﬀ due to the
1st-order correlation correction in table 1 are of comparable magnitude, 1.22 (2s) and
1.28 (2p).

Many-body theory of positron annihilation spectra

±

In spite of the large increase of Zeﬀ above the 0th-order result, the ﬁnal total in
table 2 (1.86) is still much smaller than the experimental Zeﬀ = 26.77
0.09 obtained
with room temperature positrons (Coleman et al 1975). Of course, the large size of the
1st-order diagram means that higher-order corrections are also important, especially for
the valence and subvalence orbitals. The main contribution here comes from electron-
positron ladder diagrams (e.g., A2 in ﬁgure 2). Another important eﬀect is the distortion
of the positron wavefunction by the positron-atom correlation potential (such as that
shown by diagram A3). As mentioned in section 3.2, this strong nonperturbative
eﬀect can be accounted for by calculating the positron wavefunction from the Dyson
equation. All-order summation of the ladder diagram series and the Dyson equation for
the positron have been incorporated in the calculations of Zeﬀ (Gribakin and Ludlow
2004, Ludlow 2003), yielding good agreement with accurate calculations for hydrogen
and experiment for the noble gases. We are currently applying a similar approach to
the calculation of gamma spectra (Dunlop and Gribakin 2005).

Figure 7 shows our ﬁnal gamma spectra for the 2s, 2p, 3s and 3p subshells. Addition
of the partial spectra leads to a smoother, almost featureless total. The contributions
of the inner shells are very small near the centre of the line. However, they noticeably
> 4 keV, and contribute to a overall non-Gaussian appearance
push the wings up at
of the spectrum. A similar eﬀect of core annihilation is a common feature in ACAR
and Doppler broadening spectra of positron annihilation in solids (see, e.g., Lynn et al
1977, Alatalo et al 1995, 1996, Asoka-Kumar et al 1996, Eshed et al 2002).

Let us now compare the total gamma spectrum with experiment. In Iwata 1997b,
parameters of a large number of gamma spectra for atomic and molecular species were
reported. The shapes of the spectra were determined by ﬁtting the observed spectra

a = (4 ln 2)−1/2, and the ﬁtting parameters are the line centre E0, the FWHM of the
two Gaussians, ∆E1 and ∆E2, and the relative weight of the 2nd Gaussian D. The

In ﬁgure 8 we compare the experimental spectrum for Ar in the form (45), with the
total spectra obtained in the 0th and 0th+1st-order approximations. For the purpose
of comparison, all spectra are normalized to unity at zero energy shift ǫ. As discussed
above, inclusion of the 1st-order correction makes the spectrum narrower.
It is also
clear that the enhancement due to this contribution is stronger near the centre of the
line and weaker in the wings. As a result, the wings of the 0th+1st-order spectrum in
ﬁgure 8 appear to be suppressed. The experimental data clearly favour the curve which
includes the correlation correction.

It must be said though, that the overall shape of the gamma spectrum and, in
particular, its FWHM value, appear to be very robust. They are much less sensitive to
the correlation correction than the absolute magnitude of the annihilation rate (as seen
earlier in tables 1 and 2). The reason for such robustness of the shapes of the gamma
spectra is that for slow positrons the momenta P of the annihilating electron-positron
pair are determined mainly by the momentum distribution of the bound electron. Such
distribution is described well even at the Hartree-Fock level. This explains why Iwata et
al (1997a) were able to obtain good ﬁts of the experimental data with crude 0th-order
spectra, by adjusting the relative amounts of the outer and inner-shell annihilation.

5.3. Summary of results for all noble gas atoms

Table 4 shows the FWHM values of the gamma spectra calculated using the 0th and
0th+1st-order approximations, as described in sections 5.1 and 5.2. For all atoms (except
He) the spectrum contains the contributions of the two outermost shells, e.g., for Xe,
annihilation on 4s, 4p, 4d, 5s and 5p electrons has been considered. For heavier noble
gas atoms the contribution of inner-shell annihilation becomes more important (Iwata
1997a). However, it never exceeds few per cent, and has only a small eﬀect on the
FWHM values shown in table 4. We see that for all atoms except He, the addition of
the correlation correction improves the agreement with experiment.

a Values obtained from Gaussian ﬁts to the data (Van Reeth et al 1996, Iwata et al
1997b).

The changes in Zeﬀ (table 5) due to the 1st-order correction to the annihilation
amplitude, are more pronounced. The corresponding enhancement of the annihilation
rate ranges from a factor of 1.9 in Ne to 2.9 in Xe. It is larger for heavier noble gas
atoms, where the electrons are less strongly bound, making the correlation eﬀect greater.
Nevertheless, as in Ar, the ﬁnal Zeﬀ values fall far short of experiment. Higher-order
corrections to the annihilation vertex ultimately increase it above the 0th-order result
by factors of 2.5 to 6, with a further increase coming from the distortion of the positron
wavefunction by the positron-atom correlation potential (Dzuba et al 1996, Ludlow
2003). The latter eﬀect becomes progressively stronger in Ar, Kr and Xe, due to the
existence of virtual positron states with energies closer to zero (Dzuba et al 1996).

b Measured in the gas, with small amounts of He or H2 added to Xe to improve positron
thermalization (Wright et al 1985)
c Measured in the positron trap (Murphy and Surko 1990).

Finally, in ﬁgure 9 the gamma spectra calculated in the 0th and 0th+1st-order
approximations are compared with the two-Gaussian ﬁts of the experimental data (Iwata
1997b,c). In all cases the inclusion of the vertex correction leads to better agreement
with experiment. In particular, the relative contribution of the “shoulders” associated
with the inner-shell contributions in Kr and Xe, is described more accurately. As in Ar,
the enhancement of the annihilation rates due to correlations is greater for the outer np
and ns electrons than for the inner (n
1)s subshells. When the
1)d, (n
total spectra are normalized to unity at ǫ = 0, this results in suppression of the wings.

6. Summary and outlook

In this work we have shown how a many-body perturbation series can be developed
for the amplitude of positron-atom annihilation into photons with the total momentum
P. We have also shown how this series converts into a diagrammatic expansion of the
annihilation rate Zeﬀ, upon integration over P and summation over the ﬁnal states.

Expressions for the 0th and 1st-order diagrams in the annihilation amplitude have
been derived, in terms of reduced δ-function and Coulomb matrix elements. These
contributions have been evaluated numerically for the valence and inner subshells of
the noble gas atoms. We have demonstrated the importance of extrapolation over the
angular momentum of the intermediate electron and positron states. A comparison
of the calculated and measured gamma spectra has conﬁrmed that inclusion of the
correlation correction improves agreement with experiment. The correlation correction
also leads to a sizeable enhancement of the annihilation rates, especially for the valence
and subvalence orbitals.

The large role played by the 1st-order diagram means that higher order
contributions must be considered. Thus, one needs to include vertex corrections
containing the electron-positron ladder diagrams to all orders. One also needs to
improve the incident positron wavefunction by taking into account the positron-atom

correlation potential. So far, this programme has been realised in the calculations of
positron-atom annihilation (Gribakin and Ludlow 2004, Ludlow 2003). Work is under
way to implement this for the gamma spectra. This will allow us to obtain accurate
gamma spectra for positron-atom annihilation.
In particular, a much more accurate
determination of the annihilation fraction of the inner-shell electrons in the noble gas
atoms will be possible.

It is expected that our many-body theory work will provide further insights into the
physical mechanisms which determine the shapes and intensities of the gamma spectra.
We hope that this information, and possibly even some of the methods we are developing,
will be useful for the studies of positron annihilation in more complex systems, such as
molecules, clusters and condensed matter.

Appendix: Annihilation amplitude in the coordinate representation

Suppose the initial state of the system is that of a positron with momentum k incident
on a ground-state atom. The amplitude of ﬁnding the positron and one of the electrons
at the same point and having a total momentum P in an annihilation event which leaves
the ion in the ﬁnal state f , is

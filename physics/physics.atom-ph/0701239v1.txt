Abstract. The multiconﬁguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) model has been
employed to calculate the transition rates between the nine lowest levels of radium.
The dominant rates were then used to evaluate the radiative lifetimes. The decay
of the metastable 7s7p 3P0 state through 2-photon E1M1 and hyperﬁne induced
channels is also studied.

1 Introduction

Recent advances in trapping and spectroscopy of free, neutral atoms make it possible to extend
the search for time reversal violation eﬀects into the domain of radioactive elements [1]. In the
last decade several heavy atoms were considered as candidates for experimental searches [2].
There are at least two ongoing atomic trap experiments (in Kernfysisch Versneller Instituut
in Netherlands [3,4] and in Argonne National Lab in the U.S. [5,6]) whose aim is to detect
the electric dipole moment of radium. The advantage of radium lies in octupole deforma-
tions of nuclei in several isotopes [7], simple electronic structure (ground state conﬁguration
[Kr]4d104f 145s25p65d106s26p67s2 yields the closed-shell singlet state 1S0) as well as in coin-
cidental proximity of two atomic states of opposite parity, 7s7p 3P1 and 7s6d 3D2, which are
separated by a very small energy interval 5 cm−1.

The data on atomic spectrum of radium compiled in the tables of Moore [8] came from
the experimental investigations of Rasmussen [9], with subsequent revisions by Russell [10];
both go back to the 1930s. These data cover only 69 classiﬁed lines. The isotope shifts and
hyperﬁne structures of radium were measured by the group of Wendt [11,12,13,14,15,16] in
the 1980s. They have studied both atomic Ra I and ionic Ra II spectra, and obtained the
isotope shifts, magnetic dipole hyperﬁne constants A and electric quadrupole constants B of
the 7s7p 1P1, 7s7p 3P1, 7s7p 3P2, and 7s7d 3D3 levels of neutral radium, as well as the magnetic
dipole hyperﬁne constants A of the 7s 2S1/2, 7p 2P1/2, and 7p 2P3/2 levels of Ra+ ion, together
with the electric quadrupole constant B of the 7p 2P3/2 state of Ra+. Hyperﬁne structures of
singly-ionised radium have been also the subject of several theoretical papers [17,18,19,20,21,22].

The excitation energies of several states of neutral and singly-ionised radium (and barium)
were later calculated in the framework the relativistic coupled-cluster theory by the group
of Kaldor [23,24]. More recently there have been three papers from our group in which we
calculated the lifetimes of the 7s7p 1P1 and 7s6d 3D2 states [25]; the hyperﬁne structure constants
of all levels belonging to the two lowest excited-state conﬁgurations [26]; and the electric ﬁeld
gradients generated by the electronic cloud in the 7s7p 1P1, 7s7p 3P1, and 7s7p 3P2 states, which
in turn (combined with the measured values of the electric quadrupole constants B) yielded
the nuclear electric quadrupole moment of radium-223 isotope [27]. The excitation energies and
lifetimes of several states of radium (and barium) were calculated recently in the framework
of the combined conﬁguration-interaction and many-body perturbation theory by Dzuba and
Ginges [28].

In the present paper we calculated the transition probabilities between the states arising
from the three lowest conﬁgurations of radium: 7s2 1S0, 7s7p 3P0,1,2, 7s7p 1P1, 7s6d 3D1,2,3, and
7s6d 1D2, as well as the lifetimes of these states. The purpose of the present paper is fourfold.
Firstly, we intended to extend the transition rate calculations on all levels arising from the three
lowest conﬁgurations (i.e. 7s2, 7s7p, and 7s6d). We included (1) transitions which contribute
appreciably to lifetimes; (2) transitions involving 7s6d 3D2 and 7s7p 3P1 levels because they are
of interest in EDM experiments (the mixing induced by T-odd interactions is strongest between
these two levels); (3) transitions which may be important for trapping; (4) transitions which are
stronger than 1/s (a somewhat arbitrary threshold). Secondly, new comparison of our results
became available when the two most recent papers [28,5] appeared in print. These in turn
permitted further tests of the newly developed [29] parallel version of the GRASP package [30]
and calibration the theoretical model for the calculations of the spectroscopic properties of
radium. Finally, we present a summary of the available theoretical data on the spectroscopic
properties of eight lowest excited levels of radium, with the hope that they may be of help for
the experimental groups, that are currently in the process of setting up the atomic traps for
the search of permanent electric dipole moments. The Argonne group has already measured [5]
the frequency and the rate of the 3P1 − 1S0 transition in the 225
88Ra isotope, and determined the
lifetime of the 3P1 level. The lifetime of this level have been previously calculated by Hafner
and Schwarz [31] and by Bruneau [32].

2 Theory

The modiﬁed version [29] of the GRASP implementation [30] of the multiconﬁguration Dirac-
Hartree-Fock method [33] was used in the present paper. The starting point is the Dirac-
Coulomb Hamiltonian

where V N is the monopole part of the electron-nucleus Coulomb interaction. The wavefunction
for a particular atomic state (Ψ ) is obtained as the self-consistent solution of the Dirac-Fock
equation [30] in a basis of symmetry adapted conﬁguration state functions (Φ)

The basis N CF was systematically enlarged [34,35] to yield increasingly accurate approxima-
tions to the exact wavefunction. All calculations were done with the nucleus modeled as a
variable-density sphere, where a two-parameter Fermi function [36] was employed to approxi-
mate the charge distribution. The Breit and QED corrections were estimated with the step-wise
procedure described in [34]. They were applied only to two transition rates, as explained in sec-
tion 4.3 below.

3 Method

The wavefunctions were obtained with the active space method in which conﬁguration state
functions of a particular parity and symmetry are generated by substitutions from a reference
conﬁguration to an active set of orbitals. The active set and the multiconﬁguration expansions
are increased systematically. The whole process is governed by convergence of the expectation
values. The calculations were divided into two stages. Each stage was further divided into
several consecutive steps. In the ﬁrst stage, the spectroscopic and virtual spinorbitals were
generated in relatively small multiconﬁguration expansions. The spectroscopic orbitals required
to form a reference wavefunction were obtained with a minimal conﬁguration expansion, with
full relaxation. Then virtual orbitals were generated in ﬁve consecutive steps. At each step
the virtual set has been extended by one layer of virtual orbitals. A layer is deﬁned as a
set of virtual orbitals with diﬀerent angular symmetries. In the present paper ﬁve layers of
virtual orbitals of each of the s, p, d, f, g, h symmetries were generated. At each step the
conﬁguration expansions were limited to single and double substitutions from valence shells to
all new orbitals and to all previously generated virtual layers. These were augmented by small
subsets of dominant single and double substitutions from core and valence shells, with further
restriction, that at most one electron may be promoted from core shells (which means, that in
the case of a double substitution the second electron must be promoted from a valence shell).
All conﬁgurations from earlier steps were retained, with all previously generated orbitals ﬁxed,
and all new orbitals made orthogonal to others of the same symmetry. The initial shapes of
radial orbitals were obtained in Thomas-Fermi potential, and then driven to convergence with
the self-consistency threshold set to 10−8. All radial orbitals were separately optimized for each
of the nine atomic states of interest. The Optimal Level form of the variational expression [36]
was applied in all variational calculations.

In the second stage, the conﬁguration-interaction calculations (i.e., with no changes to the
radial wavefunctions) were performed, with multiconﬁguration expansions tailored in such a
way, as to capture the dominant electron correlation contributions to the expectation values.
The valence and core-valence eﬀects constitute the dominant electron correlation contributions
in the oscillator strength calculations [37], therefore all single and double substitutions were
allowed from several core shells and both valence shells (i.e., 7s2, 7s7p, or 7s6d, depending
on the state) to all virtual shells, with the same restriction as above, i.e. that at most one
electron may be promoted from core shells. The virtual set was systematically increased from
one to ﬁve layers, until the convergence of transition rates was obtained. In a similar manner,
several core shells were systematically opened for electron substitutions — from the outermost
6p to 5s5p5d6s6p shells. The eﬀects of substitutions from 4s4p4d4f shells were neglected. We
estimated them separately for three states and discovered that they change the calculated values
of transition rates by no more than a fraction of a percent. The transition rates were calculated
with the biorthonormal technique [38,39], which permits the application of standard Racah
algebra, while retaining the advantage of wavefunctions separately optimized for each state.
Experimental values of transition energies from Moore’s tables [8] were used in calculations of
transition rates.

4 Results

4.1 The metastable 7s7p 3P0 state

In principle there are three possible decay channels of the 7s7p 3P0 state. It can decay to (the
only lower lying) ground state through (1) a blackbody radiation induced decay, (2) a 2-photon
E1M1 transition, or through (3) a hyperﬁne induced transition. The ﬁrst is beyond the scope of
the present paper, since it depends on the ambient temperature. Of the other two, the former
can be estimated through an order-of-magnitude comparison with the E1M1 1s2p 3P0 – 1s2 1S0
two-photon transition in helium-like heavy ions. We started from a recent evaluation [40], which
gives 3.14 × 109 s−1 for Ra. In order to obtain a good dependence on transition energy and
radial matrix elements, we evaluated the E1M1 matrix elements (following Eq. (2) of Ref. [40])

4

for He-like Ra (using only 1s2p 3P1 as an intermediate state) and for neutral Ra (using only
the 7s7p 3P1). Then we integrated over photon energies with the ﬁve-point Gauss-Legendre
formula. Finally, we evaluated the ratio of these two values to scale the He-like E1M1 rate. This
gives an order of magnitude estimate of 9.6 × 10−3 s−1. Such lifetime (≈ 100 s) of the 7s7p 3P0
state would be comparable to the lifetimes of nuclei of several radium isotopes (it would be
signiﬁcantly shorter only in comparison with the nuclei of the most stable radium isotopes
spanning the mass range 223-229). This would be the case of spin-zero isotopes of radium.

For the isotopes of radium with a nonzero value of nuclear spin, the hyperﬁne-induced
transition must also be considered. We estimated the 7s7p 3P0 – 7s2 1S0 transition rate with a
simple three-state model, in which the wavefunctions of the hyperﬁne components of the upper
3P0 state are described by a symmetry-adapted conﬁguration-state-function expansion of the
form

|7s7p 3P0IF iHF S = c0|7s7p 3P0IF i + c1|7s7p 1P1IF i + c2|7s7p 3P1IF i
running over the appropriate hyperﬁne components IF of the 1P1 and 3P1 states. The hyperﬁne-
induced transition rate (in s−1) may be approximately expressed as

(see [41] or [42] for full derivation). The sum in the expansion (3) should run over all excited
states, but the sum in Eq. (4) is usually dominated by those states, for which the transition rates
to the ground state are large and at the same time the energy denominators in Eq. (5) are small.
In case of the 7s7p 3P0 state of radium the 7s7p 3P1 and 7s7p 1P1 states dominate. The contribu-

due to the presence of the energy denominators in the coeﬃcients (5) and to the fact that the
corresponding oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements are many orders of magnitude smaller (actually they
are exactly zero, unless non-orthogonality between fully relaxed wavefunctions and correlation
eﬀects are not neglected), and they can be safely ignored at present level of the overall accuracy.
The rate of the hyperﬁne-induced transition is isotope-dependent, i.e. it depends on the nuclear
spin and on the nuclear magnetic moment. As in our previous paper [27], the 223
88Ra isotope was
chosen to set the nuclear parameters (the transition rate A(3P0 −1S0) may be readily recalcu-
lated for other radium isotopes, for which nuclear spins and magnetic moments are known). The
nuclear spin of 223
88Ra is I = 3/2, and the nuclear magnetic dipole moment µ = 0.2705(19)µN
was taken from the paper of Arnold et al [13]. The electric dipole transition rates A(1P1 − 1S0)
and A(3P1 − 1S0) from table 1 (in Babushkin gauge) were used. The oﬀ-diagonal magnetic dipole
M1 (3P1,3P0) = 1172 MHz, were evaluated with
constants AHF S
the use of the same wavefunctions, and in the same approximation, as described in section (3)
above. Together they yield hyperﬁne-induced transition rate A(3P0 − 1S0) = 0.0210 s−1 in case
of constructive interference, and A(3P0 − 1S0) = 0.0070 s−1 in case of destructive interference.
The above evaluations of the E1M1 and hyperﬁne-induced rates were performed indepen-
dently. As it turned out, the two contributions are of the same size, therefore they have to
be treated simultaneously. To this end we employed the eﬀective Hamiltonian method [43]. It

require that the energy separation between levels is large compared to level widths. It yields

by comparison with the results of mdfgme code [44] that non-orthogonality between spinorbitals
plays very important role in the evaluation of non-diagonal hyperﬁne matrix elements (neglect-
ing it may even lead to a sign change). We employed a new code, developed by one of us (P.J.) to
evaluate correlated oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne matrix elements from GRASP wavefunctions, taking
into account the eﬀect of non-orthogonality between spinorbitals.

may assume the 5% relative accuracy for the 3P1 − 1S0 transition rate from experiment [5]. The
accuracy of the A(1P1 − 1S0) rate is more diﬃcult to estimate (see ref. [25]). This is the strongest,
’allowed’ transition in the radium spectrum, but (as mentioned above) the contribution of its
1 k7s2 1S0i to the total value of the calculated rate of the hyperﬁne-
matrix element h7s7p 1P o
1 k7s2 1S0i matrix
induced transition 3P0 − 1S0 is 3.7 times smaller than that of the h7s7p 3P o
element, so even a relatively large error bar would be quenched. We may very conservatively
take the entire diﬀerence between the Babushkin and Coulomb gauge ﬁnal values from table 1
in reference [25] as the error limit, obtaining a relative accuracy 25% for the A(1P1 − 1S0)
transition probability. The accuracy of the diagonal magnetic dipole constants was estimated
to be 6% (see [26]). Since an oﬀ-diagonal constant depends on both states rather than on one,
we, again quite conservatively, doubled the ’diagonal’ error limit estimate and assumed 12%
as the contributions of the oﬀ-diagonal hyperﬁne constants to the error bar. Eventually, the
above procedure yields the lifetime of the metastable 3P0 state τ = 34(15)s of 223
88Ra isotope.
The lifetime is based on both the 2-photon and hyperﬁne-induced channels. The error bar does
not include the 2-photon contribution.

4.2 The 7s7p 3P1 state

Figure 1 presents the transition probability A(3P1 −1S0) as a function of the size of the mul-
ticonﬁguration expansion. The transition rates were calculated in Babushkin and Coulomb
gauges, which in the non-relativistic formulation correspond to length and velocity form of the
transition integral, respectively. Both curves were obtained in the ’core-valence’ approximation
described above. The resulting Babushkin and Coulomb values are compared with the experi-
mental result obtained by the Argonne group [5] and with three available theoretical values (the
value A=4 · 106s−1 obtained by Bruneau [32] did not ﬁt within the vertical scale of ﬁgure 1).
It is clearly seen in the ﬁgure 1 that the core-valence correlation eﬀects are saturated in the
framework of the single and restricted double substitutions and ﬁve layers of virtual orbitals,
as described in section (3) above. The remaining diﬀerence between the ﬁnal Babushkin and
Coulomb gauge values may be attributed to the omitted core-core eﬀects. We have made an
attempt to estimate the contribution of the core-core correlation to 3D2 − 1S0 and 1P1 − 1S0
transition rates [25], but for other transitions the gauge diﬀerences and comparisons with data
obtained by other authors, where available, are the only indications of the accuracy of our
calculated rates. Although the gauge diﬀerence must not be treated as the error bar per se, it is
a useful indicator in partially saturated multiconﬁguration calculations of transition rates. The
values obtained in the Babushkin gauge are weighted toward the outer parts of the electronic
wavefunctions, while the Coulomb gauge values weight more inner parts, where the core-core
eﬀects arise. Therefore partially saturated expansions often produce Babushkin and Coulomb
gauge values converging toward diﬀerent limits, as in ﬁgure 1, with the diﬀerence arising from
the omitted core-core eﬀects. This is also the reason why Babushkin gauge results are usu-
ally treated as more reliable, which seems to be conﬁrmed by the agreement of the Babushkin
gauge transition rate A(3P1 − 1S0) with experiment (although agreement this close is very likely
accidental; and good agreement for one level is not enough to justify a more general rule).

4.3 The 7s6d 3D2 and 7s7p 1P1 states

These two levels are distinguished because they were the subject of a separate paper [25]. In the
present paper we duly quote the data obtained in core-valence approximation, and the reader
is referred to the above mentioned paper for further discussion.

4.4 The remaining 7s7p 3P2, 7s6d 3D1, 7s6d 3D3, and 7s6d 1D2 states

The remaining 7s7p 3P2, 7s6d 3D1, 7s6d 3D3, and 7s6d 1D2 states, together with the states
discussed in sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 above, constitute full set of states arising from the three
lowest electronic conﬁgurations of radium.

Some of these levels should also be considered metastable, not only 7s7p 3P0. The 3D3 − 3D2
transition is the strongest ’direct’ decay channel for the 3D3 state, but it is in fact very weak
(comparable to that of the 3P0 − 1S0 transition). The rates of other possible ’direct’ decay
channels would be still smaller (e.g. M2 transition 3D3 − 3P1 rate is comparable to that of the
3D2 − 3P0 transition), therefore the multiphoton or hyperﬁne-induced transitions may also play
a role in the 3D3 lifetime. Similar considerations may in principle apply to the 3P2, 1D2, and
3D2 states (we did not pursue this issue, though).

5 Summary and conclusions

Table 1 presents calculated transition rates, and the lifetimes are presented in table 2. Coulomb
gauge values of electric multipole transitions from the table 1 were not used to obtain the
lifetimes. With the exception of the 3P0 level, the transition rates are given with 4 signiﬁcant
digits and the lifetimes with 3 signiﬁcant digits, but that not necessarily reﬂects their accuracy.

As discussed in section (4.2) above, the accuracy of our results is diﬃcult to estimate, but it is
probably much worse than 3 or 4 digits, particularly for very weak transitions.

The results of the present calculations may be considered as fully converged in core-valence
approximation (convergence has indeed been observed for all transitions, similarly to that shown
in ﬁgure 1), with core-core eﬀects omitted.

With the exception of the 1P1 − 3D2 and 1D2 − 3P1 transitions (we cannot oﬀer any plau-
sible explanation for these discrepancies), our Babushkin gauge values are in reasonably good
agreement with the results of Dzuba and Ginges [28]. An interesting feature is the large discrep-
ancy between the results obtained in Babushkin and Coulomb gauges for transitions connecting
closely-lying triplet P and triplet D states. The B/C ratios (i.e. the ratios of Babushkin versus
Coulomb gauge results) turned out to be much closer to unity for those transitions when the
experimental energies in the transition operator were replaced by theoretical ones. This obser-
vation, together with inconsistent results of the calculations of energies of excited states, had led

us [25] to suggest an experimental veriﬁcation of radium data in Moore’s tables [8]. At that time
we were not aware of the papers by Eliav et al [23] and Landau et al [24], where the excitation
energies of radium were calculated in the coupled-cluster approximation. More recently these
calculations were independently conﬁrmed within the framework of the CI+MBPT theory [28].
In both cases good agreement with experiment had been achieved. There are two principal
diﬀerences between the methods and approximations used in the abovementioned three papers
with respect to the methods and approximations used in the present paper. The transition rates
were the primary targets of the present calculations, not the transition energies. Therefore we
optimised the electronic wavefunctions separately for each of the nine states of interest. The
core-valence correlation eﬀects were fully accounted for. The core-core correlation eﬀects, which
are less important in calculations of transition rates and hyperﬁne structures, were treated in a
very crude approximation in the cases of 1S0, 3D2 and 1P1 states, and were neglected for other
states. The calculations of energy level diﬀerences require well balanced orbital sets and exten-
sive multiconﬁguration expansions. The results are usually in better agreement with experiment
if a common set of orbitals is used for both states. If the orbital sets are separately optimised,
the transition energy is obtained as a pure diﬀerence of the total energies of the two states
of interest. They are both several orders of magnitude (ﬁve orders in case of radium) larger
than the transition energy itself, therefore our calculated transition energy values may be less
accurate than the calculated transition rates and hyperﬁne structures. Any further reﬁnement
of the present calculations would require computer resources, which are currently unavailable.

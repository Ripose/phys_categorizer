oscillators

Ground state energies and wave functions of quartic and pure quartic oscillators are calculated by
ﬁrst casting the Schr¨odinger equation into a nonlinear Riccati form and then solving that nonlinear
equation analytically in the ﬁrst iteration of the quasilinearization method (QLM). In the QLM
the nonlinear diﬀerential equation is solved by approximating the nonlinear terms by a sequence of
linear expressions. The QLM is iterative but not perturbative and gives stable solutions to nonlinear
problems without depending on the existence of a smallness parameter. Our explicit analytic results
are then compared with exact numerical and also with WKB solutions and it is found that our ground
state wave functions, using a range of small to large coupling constants, yield a precision of between
0.1 and 1 percent and are more accurate than WKB solutions by two to three orders of magnitude.
In addition, our QLM wave functions are devoid of unphysical turning point singularities and thus
allow one to make analytical estimates of how variation of the oscillator parameters aﬀects physical
systems that can be described by the quartic and pure quartic oscillators.

INTRODUCTION

A basic nonrelativistic quantum mechanics problem is
to solve the Schr¨odinger equation with a potential V (x)
that governs motion of a given physical system. The ﬁrst
two terms of the power expansion of a one-dimensional,
even potential around an equilibrium position are

g2x2
2

+ λx4,

(1)

where x is the deviation from an equilibrium position.
The above potential describes the dynamics of a great
many systems that deviate from the idealized picture of
pure harmonic motion. When both g and λ are nonzero,
we call this potential a “quartic” or quartic anharmonic
oscillator; whereas, when g = 0 with nonzero λ it is
dubbed a “pure quartic” oscillator. In addition to pro-
viding an excellent description of spectroscopic molecu-
lar vibrational data(see Ref.[1] and references therein),
the quartic anharmonic oscillator (1) also serves as a ba-
sic tool for checking various approximate and perturba-
tive methods in quantum mechanics. Such an application
appears in several recent ﬁeld theoretical model studies
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].

It is well known [15, 16] that for the quartic an-
harmonic oscillator the perturbation expansion diverges
even for small couplings and becomes completely use-
less for strong coupling.
In view of this divergence
of perturbation theory, we have adopted [17, 18] the
general and very powerful quasilinearization method
(QLM) [19, 20, 21, 22, 23], which although iterative is
not a perturbative method. In QLM the p-th order solu-
tion of a nonlinear diﬀerential equation with N variables
is obtained by ﬁrst approximating the nonlinear aspect

by a sequence of linear terms and then iteratively solving
the associated linear equations. This iterative process
converges to a solution without requiring the existence
of a smallness parameter. Properties and applications of
the quasilinearization method were reviewed recently in
[24].

To apply the quasilinearization method, one ﬁrst casts
the Schr¨odinger equation into the nonlinear Riccati form
and then solves that nonlinear equation by the QLM iter-
ations. In a series of publications [17, 18, 25, 26, 27], we
have shown that for a range of anharmonic and other
physical potentials (with both weak and strong cou-
plings), the QLM iterates display very fast quadratic
convergence.
Indeed, after just a few QLM iterations,
energies and wave functions are obtained with extremely
high accuracy, reaching 20 signiﬁcant ﬁgures for the en-
ergy of the sixth iterate even in the case of very large
coupling constants.

Although numerical solutions using either the QLM
or direct numerical solution of the diﬀerential equations
can be very accurate, it is important to also provide an-
alytic solutions. Analytic solutions allow one to gauge
the role of diﬀerent potential parameters, and explore
the inﬂuence of such variations on the properties of the
quantum system under study. However, in contrast to
the harmonic oscillator, the anharmonic oscillator can-
not be solved analytically, and thus one usually has to
resort to approximations.

The goal of this paper is to obtain and test approxi-
mate analytic solutions for the quartic and pure quartic
oscillators using the explicit analytic equation for the ﬁrst
QLM iterate. We will show that both energies and wave
functions will be represented by closed analytic expres-
sions with the accuracy of the wave functions being be-

tween 0.1 and 1 percent for both small and large coupling
constants. Various accurate analytic expressions for the
energies have already appeared in the literature based on
using convergent, strong coupling expansions generated
by rearrangement of the usual divergent weak coupling
expansion [28] or by some variational requirement [29].
However, accurate analytic expressions representing wave
functions have not hitherto been known. That result is
provided here.

The ground state wave function is nodeless and for an
even potential (1) should therefore be an even function.
Its logarithmic derivative is necessarily odd, and there-
fore the boundary condition obviously is y(0) = 0 and
correspondingly yp(0) = 0.

A.

Linear Initial Condition

The zero iterate should be based on physical consider-
ations. Let us consider ﬁrst an initial guess y0(x) =
gx.
This linear initial condition completely neglects the an-
harmonic term containing λ compared with the harmonic
term and thus this initial guess is expected to be reason-
able only for relatively small values of λ.

Solution of the ﬁrst order linear diﬀerential Eq.(3) with
the above zero boundary condition at the origin can al-
ways be found analytically. For p = 1 the solution is

arithmic derivative in the ﬁrst iteration: E1 = a
2 and
bx3, where a = g + 3λ
y1(x) =

leads to the ﬁrst QLM iteration wave function ψ(x) =

energy coincides with the perturbative result, as well as

with the result obtained by Friedberg, Lee and Zhao [30]
who used their recently developed iterative method for
solving the Schr¨odinger equation.

The wave functions we obtained above obviously have
incorrect asymptotic behavior. Also, the energies E1 cal-
culated for diﬀerent λ, as displayed in Table 1, are far
from being precise. Therefore, to improve the result one
is tempted to go to the second QLM iteration, using y1(x)
as an input.

Since y2(x)e−

goes to inﬁnity, y2(x) and consequently the correspond-
ing wave function grows exponentially at inﬁnity, unless
the integral in Eq.(6) equals zero when its upper limit
equals inﬁnity. This condition yields the following ex-
pression for the energy E2 in the second iteration:

Values of E2, for this initial linear form, are compared to
exact values E calculated numerically in Table 1. It is
seen that E2 approximates the exact E reasonably well
only for small λ, as we anticipated would result from
using an initial linear condition. We now turn to another
choice for the initial form.

B. Quadratic Initial Condition

To ensure a proper wave function asymptotically, one
needs an adequate initial guess. Our second condition
is based on the asymptotic behavior of the quartic po-
tential. The zeroth iterate of the logarithmic derivative,

y0(x), is for example now obtained by taking an initial
√2λ x2. This choice
iterate of quadratic form y0(x) =
for the ﬁrst iterate automatically satisﬁes the asymptotic
and x = 0 boundary conditions, but is based on neglect-
ing the harmonic term compare with the anharmonic one.
With this quadratic initial condition, the solution

as x goes to inﬁnity, and consequently y1(x) grows expo-

The integrals in Eq.(9) can be expressed in terms of the
Euler Gamma function Γ(x) [31]. The ﬁnal expression
for the ﬁrst iterate energy based on a quadratic initial
condition reads

(cid:1)

(cid:0)
This result should be proper for large λ when the sec-
ond term of the quartic potential g2x2
2 + λx4 dominates
over the harmonic term and thus a term containing g in
initial guess y0(x) could be neglected. The above expres-
sion for the energy is not expected to be suitable for small
λ. Indeed, one can see that for the λ
0, the energy in
Eq.(10) diverges.

C. Linear Plus Quadratic Initial Condition

To obtain a result accommodating arbitrary values of
both g and λ, one has to start from an initial choice y0(x)
that takes into account the asymptotic behavior of both
the harmonic and the anharmonic parts of the potential.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The ground state energies for the quartic oscillator in
the ﬁrst QLM approximation for diﬀerent initial guesses
and for values of g = 1 and λ between zero and one
thousand and their comparison with the numerically cal-
culated exact and WKB values are given in Table 1. One
can see that the values computed using explicit equations
(12) and (14) for the QLM energy are signiﬁcantly more
accurate than the WKB values or than values obtained
in the ﬁrst and second QLM iterations with the initial
guess y0(x) =
gx. They have a precision of 0.4 to 9
percent for values of λ varying between 0.1 and 1000,
respectively.

However, the main results of our work, are not the
expressions for the energy. As mentioned in the intro-
duction, such expressions were already given in diﬀerent
forms by others. Our major results are the analytic ex-
pressions for the wave functions given by Eqs.(11) and
Eq.(13), which are based on using the ﬁrst QLM iter-
√2λx2 and
ate with the initial conditions y0 =
y0 =

g2x2 + 2λx4, respectively.

The graphs of the wave functions for the quartic os-
cillator with g = 1 and for diﬀerent λ together with
the correspondent exact and WKB wave functions, are
presented in Figs. 1, 3 and 5, while Figs. 2, 4 and 6
display the logarithm of the absolute value of the dif-
ferences between the WKB or QLM wave functions and
the exact solution for λ being equal to 0.1, 1 and 10,
respectively. The same graphs for the pure quartic os-
cillator (g = 0) are presented in Figs. 7, 9, 11 and in
Figs. 8, 10, 12, respectively. One can see that in all the
graphs the diﬀerences between the exact and QLM solu-
tions are two to three orders of magnitude smaller than
the diﬀerences between the exact and the WKB solutions
and that the QLM wave functions expressed analytically
by Eqs.(11),(13) have an accuracy of between 0.1 and 1

percent. The order of magnitude better accuracy of the
wave function compared to the poorer accuracy of the en-
ergies is explained by the fact that the general theorems
[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] for the QLM iterates show that
the solutions converge quadratically with each iteration,
while no such convergence theorem has been proven for
the energy iterates. Note, that the dips in the Figures are
artifacts of the logarithmic scale, since the logarithm of
the absolute value of the diﬀerence of two solutions goes
to
at points where the diﬀerence changes sign. The
overall accuracy of the solution can therefore be inferred
only at x values not too close to the dips.

IV. CONCLUSION

We calculated analytically the ground state energy and
wave function of the quartic and pure quartic oscillators
by casting the Schr¨odinger equation into the nonlinear
Riccati form , which is then solved in the ﬁrst iteration of
the quasilinearization method (QLM), which approaches
the solution of the nonlinear diﬀerential equation by ap-
proximating nonlinear terms with a sequence of linear
ones and does not rely on the existence of a smallness
parameter. Comparison of our results with exact nu-
merical solutions and the WKB solutions shows that the

explicit analytic expressions we obtain (12) and (14) for
the ground state energy have a precision of only a few
percent while the analytically expressed wave functions
(11) and (13) have an accuracy of between 0.1 and 1
percent and are more accurate by two to three orders
of magnitude than those given in the WKB approxima-
tion. The QLM wave function in addition possess no
unphysical turning point singularities which allows one
to use these wave functions to make analytical estimates
of the eﬀects of variation of the oscillator parameters on
the properties of systems described by quartic and pure
quartic oscillators.

Extension of this approach to excited states and to

other potentials is underway.

The next QLM iterations could be evaluated numeri-
cally [17, 18, 25, 26, 27]. These further QLM iterates for
the diﬀerent anharmonic and other physical potentials
with both strong and weak couplings also display very
fast quadratic convergence so that the accuracy of ener-
gies and wave functions obtained after a few iterations
is extremely high, reaching 20 signiﬁcant ﬁgures for the
energy of the sixth iterate even in the case of very large
coupling constants.

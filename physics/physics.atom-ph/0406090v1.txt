Rotational structures of long-range diatomic molecules

(Dated: June 15, 2004)

We present a systematic understanding of the rotational structure of a long-range (vibrationally
highly-excited) diatomic molecule. For example, we show that depending on a quantum defect, the
least-bound vibrational state of a diatomic molecule with −Cn/rn (n > 2) asymptotic interaction
can have only 1, 2, and up to a maximum of n − 2 rotational states. A classiﬁcation scheme
of diatomic molecules is proposed, in which each class has a distinctive rotational structure and
corresponds to diﬀerent atom-atom scattering properties above the dissociation limit.

INTRODUCTION

How fast can we rotate a molecule before breaking
it [1, 2]? How does a rotational series terminates at
the dissociation limit? How many rotational levels are
there for a diatomic molecule in its last (least-bound),
or next-to-last, vibrational state? These intriguing, and
closely related, questions are taking on a new dimension
of practical importance as our ability to make large sam-
ples of long-range molecules (vibrational highly-excited
molecules) [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], and even
condensates of long-range molecules [14, 15, 16], contin-
ues to grow. To understand the properties of a long-range
molecule, especially how it responds to external pertur-
bations such as collision with other atoms, we need not
only the properties of a particular molecular state, such
as the least-bound s state. We also need to know what
are the states around it.
It is this global structure of
states that is the focus of this work.

One approach to this problem is to compute the uni-
versal spectra for each type of long-range interaction,
−Cn/rn, as we have done previously for n = 6 [17, 18]
and n = 3 [19], and simply observe them. This would,
however, be very tedious and can never be completely
inclusive. Our approach here is based on the recognition
that the global structure of states, not including speciﬁc
values for binding energies, depends only on the zero-
energy wave function, more speciﬁcally, on its number
of nodes as a function of both the angular momentum
quantum number l and the exponent n characterizing
the long-range interaction.

Our results, and answers to the questions raised above,
can be summarized in two simple formulas that will be
derived later in the article. The ﬁrst gives the dependence
of the number of bound states on the angular momentum
l for a quantum system with −Cn/rn (n > 2) long-range
interaction.

(cid:21)

∗bgao@physics.utoledo.edu; http://bgaowww.physics.utoledo.edu

Here [x] means the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
Nl is the number of bound states of angular momentum
l. N0 is the number of s wave bound states. µc is a
quantum defect, to be deﬁned later, that has a range of
0 ≤ µc < 1.

The second formula relates the quantum defect to the

s wave scattering length

a0s = ¯a0s

tan(πµc) + tan(πb)
tan(πµc)

.

Here a0s = a0/βn is the s wave scattering length, a0,
scaled by the length scale βn = (2µCn/¯h2)1/(n−2) asso-
ciated with the long-range interaction; b = 1/(n − 2);
and

(cid:21)

is the mean s wave scattering length of Gribakin and
Flambaum [20], scaled by βn.

The consequences of these results are easily understood
and are discussed in Sec. III. Equation (1) is derived in
Sec. II. It is another example of universal properties at
length scale βn, as discussed in a more general terms in
two recent publications [21, 22]. This universal property
is followed by all molecules in varying degrees. Devia-
tions from it and other issues are discussed in Sec. IV. A
primer of the angular-momentum-insensitive quantum-
defect theory (AQDT) [17, 18], which is the foundation
of this work, can be found in Appendix A.

II. DERIVATION OF EQUATION (1)

Equation (1) may be derived using two diﬀerent meth-
ods. One is to apply AQDT [17, 18], the version for
arbitrary n > 2 as outline in [21] and Appendix A, to the
zero-energy state of a diatomic molecule. This approach
is discussed brieﬂy in Appendix A. The other approach is
the method of eﬀective potential [21, 22]. It is this latter
method that we present here, for the purpose of further
promoting this powerful concept. While it makes no dif-
ference in this particular case, for more complex systems,

such as quantum few-body or quantum many-body sys-
tems [22] where no analytic solutions are available, the
method of eﬀective potential may be the only way to un-
cover universal properties at diﬀerent length scales. The
results would, of course, be mostly numerical in those
cases. But a numerical solution done right can indeed
yield universal behavior [22].

The method of eﬀective potential is very simple.
It
states that for a physical observable that depends only
on states around the threshold, such as the number of
nodes of the zero-energy wave function that we are look-
its universal behavior at length scale βn
ing at here,
can be derived from any potential that has the right
asymptotic behavior and is strongly repulsive at short
distances. Speciﬁcally, a universal result at length scale
βn is obtained from the corresponding result for the ef-
fective potential by taking a proper limit to eliminate
the shorter length scales while keeping the short-range K
matrix, K c(0, l) ([17] and Appendix A), to be a constant
for one particular l [21, 22].

We take here, for simplicity, a hard-sphere with an

attractive tail (HST),

VHST(r) =

(cid:26)

∞
, r ≤ r0
−Cn/rn , r > r0

,

as our eﬀective potential. Its number of bound levels for
angular momentum l is given by ([21] and Appendix A)

NHST(l) =

(cid:26)

m , jν0,m ≤ y0 < jν0,m+1
0 , y0 < jν0,1

,

(5)

where y0 = [2/(n − 2)](βn/r0)(n−2)/2, ν0 = (2l + 1)/(n −
2), and jν0,m (m ≥ 1) is the m-th zero of the Bessel
function Jν0 (x) [23].

Its K c parameter at zero energy is given by ([21] and

Appendix A).

K c

HST(0, l) = −

Jν0(y0) cos(πν0/2) − Yν0 (y0) sin(πν0/2)
Jν0(y0) sin(πν0/2) + Yν0 (y0) cos(πν0/2)

,

where J and Y are the Bessel functions [23].

In the limit of r0 → 0+ that eliminates the shorter
length scale (see [22] for a more precise deﬁnition), y0 ≫
1, and the roots of the Bessel function are given by [24]

jν0,m → (m + ν0/2 − 1/4)π .

K c(0, l) becomes an l-independent constant

K c(0, l) → K c = tan(y0 + π/4) .

Deﬁne the quantum defect, µc(ǫ, l), to be a parameter in
a range of 0 ≤ µc < 1 and related to K c by

K c(ǫ, l) = tan

πµc(ǫ, l) +
(cid:20)

(cid:21)

It is clear that µc(0, l) also becomes an l-independent
constant

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

where j is an integer chosen such that µc falls in the range
of 0 ≤ µc < 1.

Combining these results, the number of bound states
of angular momentum l can be written in the limit of
r0 → 0+ as

NHST(l) → m , m ≤ j + µc − 1

n−2 l < m + 1 .

(11)

In other words,

NHST(l) r0→0+−→

j + µc −

n − 2

l

.

(cid:21)

(cid:20)

where [x] again means the greatest integer less than or
equal to x. Note that the result on the right-hand-side
of this equation is now no longer just a property of the
HST potential, but a universal property at length scale
βn, applicable to any quantum system with the same
long-range behavior and has a βn that is much longer
than other length scales in the system.

Since 0 ≤ µc < 1, the integer j in Eq. (12) is simply
the number of bound states for l = 0. Eq. (1) is thus de-
rived. It is trivial to show that starting from a LJ(n,2n-2)
eﬀective potential [21] (see also Sec. IV B) leads to iden-
tical result. And again, the same result can be derived
by applying AQDT to the zero-energy diatomic state, as
outlined in Appendix A.

We emphasize that the method of eﬀective potential is
fundamentally diﬀerent from the pseudopotential method
[25].
In the latter method, a diﬀerent pseudopotential
is required for each partial wave. And each pseudopo-
tential has at least one independent parameter to char-
acterize the scattering of that particular partial wave.
Without another theory relating scattering of diﬀerent
partial waves, no universal l-dependence of any kind can
be established. (This is in addition to its well known lim-
itations in describing bound states.) In contrast, a single
eﬀective potential is used to describe all l. And one can
do this because a single parameter in AQDT describes a
multitude of angular momentum states (see [17, 18] and
Appendix A). Put it in another way. Scattering of diﬀer-
ent angular momenta are indeed related, and so are the
bound spectra of diﬀerent angular momenta. Their re-
lationships are determined by the long-range interaction
([17, 18] and Appendix A), and are incorporated auto-
matically in an eﬀective potential [21]. The universal
property described by Eq. (1) is but one reﬂection of this
type of systematics. To further re-enforce this concept,
we leave as an exercise to derive the relationship between
the p wave scattering length and the s wave scattering
length for n = 6. The derivation is trivial and all the in-
formation required can be found in Appendix A and [26].
The answer will be provided in an upcoming publication.

make our statements unnecessarily complex without in-
troducing any new physics. In speciﬁc applications, all
one needs to do is to exclude states that cannot satisfy
the symmetry requirement (see, for example, [27]), as
needed.

The physical implications of Eq. (1) can be easily un-
derstood by noting that N0 − 1 is the maximum vibra-
tional quantum number, vmax, while Nl − 1 is the maxi-
mum vibrational quantum number, vmax,l, that can sup-
port a rotational state of angular momentum l. A vibra-
tional state v can have all l for which vmax,l ≥ v. Letting
Lmax,v to be the maximum rotational quantum number
for vibrational state v, we have from Eq. (1)

v =

vmax + µc −

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

which can be written as

Lmax,v = (n − 2)(vmax − v) + [(n − 2)µc] ,

(14)

where the square braket in the second term, [x], again
denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x

This result suggests the classiﬁcation of molecules into
n − 2 classes, each corresponding to an equal interval of
b = 1/(n − 2) in the quantum-defect space. For class i
with ib ≤ µc < (i + 1)b, we have i ≤ (n − 2)µc < i + 1,
and therefore

Lmax,v(i) = i + (n − 2)(vmax − v) .

(15)

Thus each class of molecules corresponds to a unique
rotational structure that terminates at Lmax,v(i). This
classiﬁcation is summarized in Table I. In particular, it
means that the least-bound vibrational state can have
1 (Class 0), 2 (Class 1), and up to a maximum of n − 2
(Class n−3) rotational states, depending on the quantum
defect of the molecule. For the next-to-last vibrational
state, add n − 2 rotational states to each class, and so on
for lower vibrational states.

What makes this classiﬁcation useful is that each class
not only has a distinctive rotational structure, it also cor-
responds to distinctive atom-atom scattering properties

3

above the dissociation limit. First, each class of molecules
corresponds to a distinctive (non-overlapping) range of
scattering length, which can be determined from Eq. (2)
and is summarized in Table I.

Equation (2) derives easily from the deﬁnition of the
mean scattering length [20], Eq. (3), the deﬁnition of
the quantum defect, Eq. (9), and the following rigorous
relation between K c and the s wave scattering length
([21] and Appendix A)

Flambaum [20]. These equations combine to give

(17)

which is the exact relation between scattering length and

quantum defect.
Eq. (2), applicable even when the system deviates from
the universal behavior (see Sec. IV C and Appendix A).
With the correspondence between quantum defect and
scattering length, our classiﬁcation of molecules can
translate into other general statements, such as, a) The
least-bound vibrational state of a diatomic molecule with
a0s ≥ 2¯a0s has only a single rotational state. b) The
least-bound vibrational state of a diatomic molecule with
negative scattering length has n − 2 rotational states.
It is worth noting that molecules with negative scatter-
ing length all fall into a single class, Class n − 3, while
molecules with positive scattering length separate into
n − 3 classes, from Class 0 to Class n − 4. A similar
feature was ﬁrst noted by Gribakin and Flambaum [20].
The diﬀerent scattering properties for diﬀerent classes
are not restricted to the s wave. In fact, more interesting
diﬀerences occur for higher partial waves. For example,
Class 0 does not have a p wave bound state for the last
vibrational level. This p state, which would have been
bound for µc ≥ b, does not disappear completely.
It
shows itself as p wave shape-resonance above the thresh-
old, which actually becomes inﬁnitely narrow (inﬁnitely
long-lived) as one approaches µc = b from the side of
Class 0. In general, a Class i system is the one that has
a shape-resonance of l = i + 1 closest to the threshold.
The detailed properties of these resonances are however
beyond the scope of this article (see, e.g. [17, 26, 28, 29]).
The critical values of µc = ib that are the boundaries
between diﬀerent classes correspond to having bound or
quasibound states of angular momenta l = i + (n − 2)j
(j being a non-negative integer) right at the threshold
(Appendix A). They have vibrational quantum numbers
of v = vmax − j, respectively. This is a generalization of
some of the results in [18] to the case of arbitrary n > 3.
Note that the wave functions for zero-energy bound or
quasibound states are well deﬁned and are given in the
region of long-range potential by (Appendix A)

uǫ=0l(r) = Ar1/2

s Jν0 (y) ,

(18)

where rs = r/βn is a scaled radius, and y = [2/(n −
−(n−2)/2
. This wave function has an asymptotic be-

s
havior of 1/rl at large r, thus representing a true, nor-
malizable, bound state for l > 0, and a quasibound (not
normalizable) state for l = 0. The fact that s-wave wave
function in the eﬀective-range theory becomes completely
meaningless when a0 = ∞ is only a limitation of the the-
ory, not a reﬂection of any physical reality.

IV. DISCUSSIONS

We discuss here some special cases, deviations from the

universal behavior, and how they might be treated.

A. The case of n = 3

Our result is applicable to n = 3, even though the
scattering length has no deﬁnition in this case (for any
l) [30, 31]. Speciﬁcally, it predicts that quantum sys-
tems with n = 3 have only a single class (Class 0) with
In other words, the last vibra-
Lmax,v = vmax − v.
tional state for n = 3 has a single rotational state, an
s state. The next-to-last vibrational state has two rota-
tional states, and so forth. This prediction is conﬁrmed
by the analytic solution for −C3/r3 potential [19, 31].

B. The special case of LJ(n,2n-2) potentials

For a set of Lennard-Jones potentials LJ(n,2n-2) (n >

2) deﬁned by

VLJn(r) = −Cn/rn + C2n−2/r2n−2 ,

(19)

the number of bound levels for any l is given by ([21] and
Appendix B)

NLJn(l) =

2 − ν0

2

z0 + 1
0
( (cid:2)

(cid:3)

, z0 ≥ (ν0 + 1)/2
, z0 < (ν0 + 1)/2

,

(20)

where ν0 = (2l + 1)/(n − 2), and the square braket [x]
again means the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
z0 = (βn/β2n−2)n−2/[2(n−2)], where β2n−2 is the length
scale assoicated with the C2n−2/r2n−2 interaction. Thus
for the LJ(n,2n-2) potential, the universal dependence of
the number of bound states on l, as speciﬁed by Eq. (1),
is exact, true even when β2n−2 is comparable to βn and
the corresponding potentials are so shallow as to support
only a single or a few bound states.

This result implies that to break the universal depen-
dence on l, one needs not only a short-range interaction,
but the behavior of this interaction also has to be diﬀer-
ent from LJ(n,2n-2).

C. Deviations from the universal behavior

The key to understand qualitatively the deviations
from the universal behavior is to recognize the origin
of this universality. The universal l-dependence origi-
nates from the l-independence of K c(0, l) ([17] and Ap-
pendix A), which is a result of both the small mass ratio
me/µ, where me is the electron mass and µ is the re-
duced mass of the molecule (not to be confused with the
quantum defect µc), and the condition of βn ≫ r0 where
r0 is a representative of other length scales in the system.
(For HST potential, it coincides with the r0 that we used
earlier.)

With this understanding, it is clear that the universal
behavior of Eq. (1) should be followed by all molecules to
some degree. The mass ratio me/µ is always small and
can be taken for granted. (This is why we don’t always
mention it.) And almost by deﬁnition, βn is the longest
length scale in the problem, otherwise it would not, and
should not have been called the long-range interaction.

It is also clear that the universal behavior is best
followed by the states with highest vibrational quan-
tum numbers. For example, consider our prediction of
Lmax,v(i) = i + (n − 2)(vmax − v). For the least-bound
it would only require l-
vibrational state, v = vmax,
independence of K c over a range of ∆l = n − 2.
In
comparison, the same result applied to v = vmax − 9
would require l-independence of K c over 10 times that
range, which generally becomes considerably worse (de-
pending also on n, and other details of the short-range
interaction).

As far as predictions for the last few vibrational states
(long-range molecules) are concerned, there is no need
to worry about deviation except when µc is very close
to one of the critical values of µc = ib, where a small
l-dependence may mean the diﬀerence between a bound
state and a shape resonance.

Whenever necessary, the deviation from universal be-
havior can be easily handled within the AQDT frame-
work. All we need is to count the nodes of the zero-
energy wave functions more carefully! As discussed in
Appendix A, AQDT is an exact formulation and an ex-
cellent platform for exact numerical calculations. This
also applies to node-counting: integrate the Schr¨odinger
equation at zero energy and count the nodes up to a
distance where K c(0, l) has converged to a desired accu-
racy [One computes K c(0, l) by matching the integrated
wave function to that given by Eq. (A8) at diﬀerent radii
r. As a function this matching radius, K c(0, l) con-
verges to a r-independent constant when the potential
becomes −Cn/rn and the wave function becomes that of
Eq. (A8)]. Adding to that the number of nodes beyond
this distance, which can now be calculated analytically,
gives one the total number of nodes. This way, one would
never miss a node which could potentially be at inﬁnity.
One could also try to ﬁnd if there are any systemat-
ics in the deviation by going to the next, shorter, length
scale. Any such attempt would however be necessarily

system-speciﬁc and will be deferred to speciﬁc applica-
tions. Examples of the universal rotational structure for
n = 6 can already be found in [17, 18], though they were
not discussed explicitly. It was the simple structures ob-
served there that motivated this work.

V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have shown that the rotational struc-
ture of a long-range molecule follows a simple univer-
sal behavior that is characterized by two parameters,
the exponent n of the long-range interaction −Cn/rn,
and a quantum defect, which is related in a simple way
to the s wave scattering length [whenever it is well de-
ﬁned (n > 3)]. The resulting classiﬁcation scheme gives
a simple qualitative description of both the rotational
structure of a long-range molecule and the correspond-
ing atom-atom scattering properties above the dissocia-
tion threshold.

Finally, getting back to one of the questions at the
beginning that we have not answered explicitly: how fast
can we rotate a molecule before breaking it? The answer
is, of course, Lmax,v units of angular momenta, which is
generally a very small number for long-range molecules.

APPENDIX A: AQDT: A PRIMER

We give here a brief review of the angular-momentum-
insensitive quantum defect theory (AQDT) [17, 18]. The
focus will be on the conceptual aspects, and issues di-
rectly related to this particular work. We point out that
there are a number of diﬀerent quantum-defect formu-
lations for diatomic systems [27, 32, 33, 34, 35]. There
are also quantum-defect analysis [36, 37], and numerical
methods that incorporate the concepts of quantum-defect
theory [38]. Only our formulation is brieﬂy reviewed here.

Consider a radial Schr¨odinger equation

where V (r) becomes −Cn/rn beyond a distance r0. (r0
does not have to have a precise value like the case of
HST. It is a representative of length scales associated
with interactions of shorter range, introduced to simplify
our discussion.)

In AQDT, the wave function in the region of long-range
interaction (r ≥ r0) is written as a linear superposition

of a pair of reference functions

uǫl(r) = Aǫl[f c

ǫsl(rs) − K c(ǫ, l)gc
which also serves to deﬁne the short-range K matrix
K c(ǫ, l). The functions f c and gc are solutions for the
long-range potential −Cn/rn [31, 39]. Their notations
reﬂect the fact that with proper scaling and normaliza-
tion, f c and gc depend on r only through a scaled radius
rs = r/βn and on energy only through a scaled energy
[31, 39]

ǫs =

(A3)

Note that for the purpose of cleaner notion for arbitrary
n, we have abandoned the factor of 16 used previously for
n = 6 [17, 18, 26, 39], and the factor of 4 used previously
for n = 3 [19, 31].

Much of the art of a quantum defect theory [40, 41, 42,
43] is in choosing f c and gc that best reﬂect the under-
lying physics. For a molecule, the wave function at short
distances is nearly independent of l because the rotational
energy is small compared to electronic energy (originated
from the small mass ratio me/µ). AQDT takes advantage
of this fact by picking a pair of solutions for −Cn/rn po-
tential that have not only energy-independent, but also
l-independent behavior at short distances (possible be-
cause n > 2) [17, 21, 22]:

f c

where y = [2/(n − 2)]r

.

With this choice of reference pairs, matching to wave
function at short distances yields an K c that is nearly
independent of l, provided that r0 is much smaller than
βn so that the reference functions at this point are well
represented by their l-independent form of Eqs. (A4)-
(A5).

An approximately l-independent K c thus reﬂects the
underlying physics that for long-range molecules and
atom-atom scattering at low energies, the angular mo-
mentum dependence is most important only at large dis-
tances where its eﬀects can be incorporated analytically.
This is the physical origin of why a single parameter in
AQDT is often capable of describing a multitude of an-
gular momentum states [17, 18, 21]. The results of this
work is but one reﬂection of the resulting systematics.

The approximate energy-independence of K c, under
the same condition of βn ≫ r0 is fairly standard [40, 42].
It is both because the reference functions have been cho-
sen to be energy-independent at short distances, and be-
cause the short-range wave function varies with energy
on a scale of (¯h2/2µ)(1/r0)2, much greater than the cor-
responding energy scale associated with the long-range
interaction, which is (¯h2/2µ)(1/βn)2 [19].

In a multichannel theory that takes into account the
hyperﬁne structures of atoms (starting from the formu-
lation in [27]), the concepts of AQDT, and the concept

of l-independence in particular, remain unchanged and
lead to an even greater reduction in the number of pa-
rameters required for a complete characterization of the
system [44, 45]

We emphasize that AQDT is an exact formulation that
does not require either the energy-independence or the l-
independence of K c.
It is simply the best framework,
especially conceptually, to take advantage of them when
they are there (βn ≫ r0). The parameterizations that we
often use to extract universal behaviors should not dis-
tract from the fact that AQDT also provides an excellent
platform for exact numerical calculations, whether single
channel [21] or multichannel. This is especially true close
to the dissociation limit, where matching to analytic solu-
tions for −Cn/rn potential to obtain K c(ǫ, l) converges
much faster than matching to free-particle solutions to
obtain the standard K matrix. The calculations in [21]
are all based on this platform. [AQDT may even be the
best method to calculate the scattering length when it is
close to inﬁnity.]

A major task of AQDT is, of course, ﬁnding the ref-
erence functions. This is in general highly nontrivial
[31, 39], especially analytically. No solution is yet avail-
able for n = 5 at ǫ 6= 0. This diﬃculty is however not a
problem here as we need only the zero-energy reference
functions, which can be easily found for arbitrary n and

tions, the zero-energy wave function can be written either
as

physics. K c is more convenient in computation, while

Equation (5) is simply a result of node-counting the
wave function, given exactly by Eq. (A9), from r0 to
inﬁnity (y = 0 to y0) [24]. Equation (6) is obtained
simply by imposing the boundary condition uǫ=0l(r =
r0) = 0.

Equation (16) is obtained by comparing the asymptotic
behavior the uǫ=0l(r) (for l = 0) at large r with the cor-
responding expansion that deﬁnes the s wave scattering

length.

uǫ=0l=0(r) → A(r − a0) .

(A10)

The derivation of Eq. (1) in AQDT is straightforward.
In the limit of r0 ≪ βn, the number of nodes of the
zero-energy wave function inside r0 is an l-independent
constant [to a degree measured by the l-independence of
K c(0, l)]. Counting the number of nodes of the outside
wave function, Eq. (A9), from r0 to inﬁnity (y = 0 to
y0) [24], and ignoring the l-dependence of µc(0, l) leads
to Eq. (1). From this derivation, it is clear that deviation
from the universal behavior is measured by the degree to
which µc(0, l) or K c(0, l) is independent of l.

Having a bound or quasibound state right at the
threshold corresponds to the boundary condition of
uǫ=0l(r) → 0 (a ﬁnite constant for l = 0) in the limit
of r → ∞. Deﬁne

xl(ǫ) ≡ tan[πµc(ǫ, l) − πlb] .

(A11)

From Eq. (A9), the condition for a bound-state at the
threshold is clearly

xl(0) = tan[πµc(0, l) − πlb] = 0 ,

(A12)

which translates into µc(0, l) = ib for having bound or
quasibound states of angular momenta l = i + (n − 2)j
right at threshold, with corresponding wave functions
given by Eq. (18). In terms of K c, the same condition
takes the form of

K c(0, l) = tan

which is a generalization of the condition in [18] to the
case of arbitrary n. Note that the conditions expressed in
the form of Eqs. (A12) and (A13) are exact, with no as-
sumption on the l-independence of either parameter. The
universal behavior corresponds to when the l-dependence
can be ignored (βn ≫ r0).

The xl(ǫ) parameter deﬁned by Eq. (A11) has also
other applications. For example, for µc(0, l) >≈ ib,
xl(0) >≈ 0 is a convenient expansion parameter for de-
scribing bound states of angular momenta l = i+(n−2)j
that are close to the threshold. xl(ǫ) is also closely
related to the K 0
l (ǫ) matrix used in [26], simply by
K 0
l (ǫ) = −xl(ǫ). With this relation, all the results of [26]
can be rewritten in terms of either K c or µc. Making use
of the l-independence of either parameter in these results
leads, for example, to the relation between p and s wave
scattering lengths. This has been left as an exercise, with
the answer to be provided elsewhere.

Reference [26] oﬀers an important lesson on the im-
portance of picking reference functions. The f 0 and g0
functions in [26, 39], which deﬁne K 0, diﬀer from f c and
gc only by trivial linear transformation. But because
the resulting K 0
l (ǫ) = − tan[πµc(ǫ, l) − πlb] did depend
on l, relationships between scattering and bound spectra
of diﬀerent angular momenta were not recognized until

much later [17, 18]. Reference [26] was only able to take
advantage of the energy-independence of K 0
l to show,
for example, that the eﬀective range and the scattering
length are not independent, but are related in a way de-
termined by the long-range interaction. The same con-
clusion was also reached independently by Flambaum et
al. using a diﬀerent approach [47].

APPENDIX B: DERIVATION OF THE RESULTS
FOR LJ(N,2N-2) POTENTIALS

The analytic results for NLJn(l), Eq. (20), and
LJn(0, l) given in [21] [and therefore µc
K c
LJn(0, l), and of
course a0s] are derived from the zero-energy solution of
the radial Schr¨odinger equation, Eq. (A1), for the class of
potentials deﬁned by Eq. (19). Instead of giving all the
boring math details, we prefer to simply note its relation-
ship to the harmonic oscillator solution, as they have the
same underlying mathematical structure.

Upon a transformation x = (r/βn)α and ul(r) =
x−(α−1)/(2α)vl(x) with α = −(n − 2)/2, the correspond-
ing equation at zero energy becomes

with γ + 1/2 = [2/(n − 2)](l + 1/2).
Thus for
the class of potentials given by Eq. (19), the solu-
tion of the radial Schr¨odinger equation at zero en-
ergy is equivalent to the solution of a 3-D isotropic
harmonic oscillator with an eﬀective angular momen-
tum γ, a eﬀective frequency determined by ¯hω =
(¯h2/2µ)(2/|α|)(β2n−2/βn)n−2(1/βn)2, at an eﬀective en-
ergy (not zero) Ee = (¯h2/2µ)(1/α2)(1/βn)2. From this
correspondence, both results are easily deduced. For ex-
ample, the number of bound states is simply the number
of harmonic oscillator states below, and including Ee.

Cold, dense Rydberg gases produced in a cold-atom
trap are investigated using spectroscopic methods and time-
resolved electron counting. On the discrete Rydberg reso-
nances we observe large trap losses and long lasting elec-
tron emission from the Rydberg gas (>30ms). Our observa-
tions are explained by quasi-elastic l-mixing collisions between
Rydberg atoms and slow electrons that lead to the population
of long-lived high-angular-momentum Rydberg states. These
atoms thermally ionize slowly and with large probabilities,
leading to the observed eﬀects.

Laser-cooled atoms can be used to study highly ex-
cited Rydberg atoms [1] at both large densities and low
atomic velocities. Due to the low velocity of the Rydberg
atoms, ionizing Rydberg-Rydberg collisions that domi-
nate the behavior of hot Rydberg gases [2–4] are largely
suppressed. Therefore, the interactions between the Ryd-
berg atoms, free electrons and ions result in a variety of
novel phenomena that are speciﬁc to translationally cold
Rydberg gases. Density-dependent eﬀects have been ob-
served in the resonant excitation transfer between cold
Rydberg atoms [5,6]. A minute increase of the frequency
of the Rydberg excitation laser leads to the production
of metastable cold plasmas rather than cold Rydberg
gases [7]. At a critical density corresponding to about
one atom per atomic volume, Rydberg gases might un-
dergo a Mott transition that would lead to a new kind of
metastable matter [8–10]. The formation of metastable
Rydberg matter might proceed through an intermediate
phase, in which the Rydberg population accumulates in
long-lived high-angular-momentum (high-l) states [10].
In the present paper, we show that in cold Rydberg gases
high-l Rydberg states are eﬃciently produced by a ro-
bust mechanism, which is, in a similar form, also at work
in ZEKE (ZEro Kinetic Energy) electron - spectroscopy,
a powerful technique that has revolutionized molecular
spectroscopy [11].

In our experimental cycle, 87Rb atoms are collected
and cooled in a magneto-optic trap (MOT [12], see Fig. 1)
for about 950ms. 1ms after the shutdown of the MOT a
5µs long diode laser pulse (λ = 780nm) resonant with the
5S1/2, F = 2 → 5P3/2, F = 3 transition is applied. While
the 780nm pulse is on, a blue dye laser pulse (λ ≈ 480nm,
10ns width, bandwidth ≈ 15GHz, repetition rate 10Hz)
excites ns- and nd-Rydberg states from the intermediate
5P3/2-level. The maximum photon ﬂuence of one blue

pulse easily exceeds the saturation ﬂuence at the pho-
toionization threshold (7 × 1016cm−2 at λion = 479.1nm
[13]). If the dye laser operates with the oscillator only,
the broad-band ASE (ampliﬁed spontaneous emission)
contained in the blue pulse is < 1% of the pulse energy
(≈ 50µJ). With the dye ampliﬁers on, the ASE contains
≈ 10% of the pulse energy, is about 5nm wide and cen-
tered at λ = 478nm, which is above the ionization thresh-
old. The pulsed dye laser is pumped by the 3rd harmonic
of a Nd-YAG laser (355nm), a small fraction of which
(<1mJ) can be diverted to partially ionize the atomic
cloud before the blue laser pulse arrives. The Rydberg
excitation causes a reduction of the ground-state pop-
ulation, which reduces the area density of ground-state
atoms that we measure with a low-intensity probe laser
pulse resonant on the 5S1/2, F = 2 → 5P3/2, F = 3 tran-
sition. A microchannel-plate (MCP) detector located
about 10cm from the atomic cloud is used to detect elec-
trons emitted from the Rydberg gas.

FIG. 1. Level scheme (left) and outline of the experimental

setup (right).

Fig. 2a) shows a trap-loss spectrum taken with both
the 5S1/2 → 5P3/2 and the Rydberg transition saturated.
In the continuum as well as on the discrete Rydberg res-
onances up to about 70% of the atoms are removed. The
trap-loss spectra are largely independent of the time at
which the probe pulse is applied. Thus, the observed trap
loss is mostly due to the permanent loss of atoms from
the trap upon excitation. The observed trap loss is a cu-
mulative eﬀect, as each trapped atom experiences many
blue laser pulses during the MOT loading time (2.5s). We
have used a simple model of the MOT loading dynamics
to estimate the single-pulse loss fraction X. In Fig. 2b),
a ﬂoor of X ≈ 1% is observed between the discrete Ryd-
berg lines, which is due to direct photoionization by the
above discussed 10% ASE of the blue pulse. The discrete
Rydberg lines peak at an X of up to 8% above the ﬂoor,
a value that corresponds to one-third loss of the excited

1

Rydberg atom population. Further, there is no signiﬁ-
cant change in X at the continuum threshold. Our ob-
servations show that there is a process by which initially
bound Rydberg atoms permanently leave the trap with
an eﬃciency that rivals direct optical photoionization.

Two-body ionizing Rydberg-Rydberg collisions could,
in principle, cause a trap loss. Based on an ionization
cross section given in [4], a Rydberg atom velocity of
0.1m/s, a lifetime of 100µs (n ≈ 40), and a Rydberg atom
density of 5×109cm−3 we estimate a collisional ionization
probability of ≈ 0.5% of the excited Rydberg population,
corresponding to an X ≈ 0.13%. This ﬁgure is too small
for two-body ionizing Rydberg-Rydberg collisions to be
the dominant source of trap loss.

To estimate the importance of thermally induced mi-
crowave ionization of the excited ns and nd Rydberg
states, we have performed rate equation simulations of
the population ﬂow among the bound atomic states and
the continuum. We use a basis (n, l) of discrete levels up
to n = 100 with all allowed values of l and the proper
quantum defects, and a grid of 10100 continuum states
(ǫ, l) with energies up to ǫ = 130meV and l = 0, 1, .., 101.
Due to isotropy, we can assume uniform distributions
over the magnetic substates and use m-averaged transi-
tion rates [1]. The obtained thermal ionization probabil-
ities for an ideal 300K blackbody spectrum are displayed
in Fig. 3.

While direct thermal ionization of the initially excited
states does not cause enough ionization to explain the
observed trap loss - see Fig. 3 -, it produces ions mov-
ing at about 1m/s and electrons with about 8meV av-
erage kinetic energy; the latter ﬁgure results from the
rate-equation calculations. Based on Fig. 3 and on the
number of excited Rydberg atoms, we estimate that up

2

to ∼ 105 electron-ion pairs are created. If the blue laser
is used with its ampliﬁers active, the ionizing ASE of the
blue laser pulse adds a signiﬁcant amount of additional
electron-ion pairs (electron energy ≈ 10meV). As a re-
sult, conditions are such that a metastable cold plasma
is formed [7]: A fraction of the electrons quickly evapo-
rates, leaving behind a plasma with a net positive charge
that acts as an electron trap. If, under our conditions,
the initial number of electrons exceeds about 1000, the
trap becomes deep enough to retain a fraction of the elec-
trons [7]. The net positive charge causes a slow Coulomb
expansion, due to which all trapped electrons eventually
evaporate. The electron storage time is thereby limited
to of order 100µs, which is long enough for the retained
electrons to frequently collide with the main product of
the laser excitation - the bound Rydberg atoms ﬂoating
in the plasma. The collisions initiate a sequence of events
we refer to as the ZEKE-eﬀect.

In step A of the ZEKE-eﬀect (see Fig. 4), the atoms
are promoted from their initial s or d-states into a high-l-
state by the electric-ﬁeld sweep produced by a bypassing
electron. The ﬁeld sweep brings the initial Rydberg state
in contact with a hydrogenic manifold of high-l states,
and state-mixing causes a quasi-elastic transition of the
atom into a superposition of high-l-states. To model
these collisions, we have numerically solved the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation. For a given initial state
|n0, l0, m0i, electron velocity v and collision parameter b
the calculation yields a ﬁnal probability P (n0, l0, v, b) of
ﬁnding the atom in the hydrogenic manifold, i.e.
in a
state with l ≥ 4. For l0 6= 0, we run the calculation for
the allowed values of m0 and average the resultant prob-
abilities over m0. The cross section σ for a transition into
l ≥ 4 is then deﬁned as

σ(n0, l0, v) = Z b=∞

For l0 = 0, 1 or 2 it is easy to determine an upper cutoﬀ
value for b where P → 0. The range b < a0n2, where the
neglected ionizing processes should become dominating
[4], does not signiﬁcantly contribute to σ.

FIG. 5. Left: Calculated l-mixing cross sections σ for col-
lisions of Rydberg atoms in the indicated initial states with
electrons versus the electron energy. Right:
l-mixing cross
sections σ with n5
eﬀ -ﬁts (dotted) for s- and d initial states at
an electron energy of 4.5meV versus the eﬀective quantum
number.

Fig. 5 shows the results of our cross section calcula-
tions for the s and d-states of two values of n. The drop
of σ at higher electron energy reﬂects the fact that the
passage behavior of the Rydberg atoms in the Stark map
(Fig. 4) turns diabatic. The s-states generally have cross
sections about 2.5 times smaller than the cross sections
of the nearest d-state. This reﬂects the diabatic crossing
behavior of the s-state atoms with the lowest few states
of the nearest hydrogenic manifold - note the narrow an-
ticrossings in Fig. 4. For ﬁxed electron energy, the cross
sections approximately scale as n5
eﬀ. The average values
of l of the atoms that made a transition into the hy-
drogenic manifold are of order n/2 (not shown), i.e. the
l-distribution becomes pretty well randomized within the
hydrogenic manifold.

3

The plasma volume (≈ 1mm−3), the electron num-
ber (≥ 1000), the electron velocity (≈ 50000 m/s), the
electron storage time (≈100µs), and the cross sections
depicted in Fig. 5 lead to the conclusion that the step A
in Fig. 4 happens with certainty for n larger than about
20. The presence of the plasma that temporarily traps
the electrons is crucial, as it keeps the electrons from
leaving and causes them to frequently collide with the
abundant, bound Rydberg atoms ﬂoating in the plasma.
Collisions between Rydberg atoms and ions are ineﬀec-
tive, because the ions are very slow (≈ 1m/s), as are the
Rydberg atoms themselves.

After step A in Fig. 4, the weak but rapidly varying
microﬁelds generated by more distant electrons will be
suﬃcient to further randomize the Rydberg population
among the quantum-defect-free hydrogenic states (step
B). Step B is more probable than step A, but it is not
required for the subsequent step C. Once all plasma elec-
trons have evaporated, the only electric ﬁelds the Ryd-
berg atoms are still exposed to are the ﬁelds generated
by the very slowly moving ions. Therefore, we expect
that the plasma dynamics and the internal dynamics of
the Rydberg atoms decouple at about 100µs after the
excitation.

FIG. 6. Electron count rates for the indicated Rydberg
d-states vs. the delay time between the Rydberg excitation
and the counting gate. The signal lasts at least 100 times as
long as the natural lifetime of the initially excited states, and
shares the qualitative features of simulated results (dotted).

Subsequently, while the cloud of high-l Rydberg atoms
produced by the steps A and B slowly expands, the atoms
decay or thermally ionize on a slow time scale (step C in
Fig. 4). To model the overall dynamics of the Rydberg
population, we have included an initial ”plasma phase”
in our rate-equation simulations. During that phase,
the populations in the n-manifolds and the nearby non-
hydrogenic states are periodically averaged over the al-
lowed l-values (with weights ∼ (2l+1)); after the “plasma
phase” the averaging ceases. The obtained ionization
probabilities are displayed in Fig. 3 for 25µs and 500µs
long plasma phases. The ionization probabilities are sta-
ble against variations of the duration of the plasma phase
and are large enough to explain the experimentally ob-
served trap losses.

The discussed model is supported by the results de-

s
s
scribed in the following. Using the MCP detector lo-
cated near the atom trap, we have measured the thermal
ionization current vs.
time (Fig. 6). When we excite
discrete Rydberg levels, we ﬁnd long-lived electron sig-
nals that extend beyond 30ms and that only occur if the
frequency of the blue laser is resonant with a discrete
Rydberg line. The delayed electron signal, which is char-
acteristic for the ZEKE-eﬀect [11], is due to thermal ion-
ization of high-l Rydberg states.

Fig. 7 shows the electron current in a time-delayed
the wavelength of the blue laser
counting window vs.
for conditions well below the saturation of the Rydberg
transition. The clarity of the ionization threshold in the
long-lived electron signal, which is typical for the ZEKE-
eﬀect [11], shows that the delayed electrons are linked
to the initial optical excitation of bound Rydberg atoms.
In Fig. 7a) the blue pulse is generated with the dye laser
oscillator only, which has practically no ASE. Therefore,
all electron-ion pairs that are created within about 100µs
from the Rydberg excitation originate in thermal ioniza-
tion of the excited ns- or nd-Rydberg atoms. Since the
5P → ns-photoexcitation cross sections are about six
times smaller than the ones of the neigboring d-states,
and since the thermal ionization probability of the s-
states is only half that of the neighboring d-states (see
Fig. 3), the thermal electron yield on the s-lines is less
than one-tenth of the yield on the neighboring d-lines.
Recalling that of order 1000 slow electrons are needed to
form the essential cold-plasma electron trap - with some
electrons left in it -, it follows that there is a wide range
of parameters where the ZEKE-signal should occur on
the d-lines, but not on the neighboring s-lines. Fig. 7a),
where the s-lines barely appear, shows one such case.

We have used two methods to force a ZEKE-signal
on the s-lines in cases where it would normally not ap-
pear. In Fig. 7b) we have used the same parameters as
in a), except that the blue laser pulse has been generated
with a dye-laser ampliﬁer being active. The pulse has
then been attenuated to the same pulse energy as in a).
The ASE produced by the ampliﬁer creates enough slow
electron-ion pairs to form the cold-plasma electron trap,
independent of whether the coherent part of the laser ex-
cites d or s Rydberg atoms. As a result, we observe both
s and d lines in the ZEKE-signal. In Fig. 7c), the blue
laser pulse is the same as in a), i.e. it has no ASE, but we
ionize a small fraction of the atoms by a UV laser pulse
that hits the cloud a few ns before the blue laser pulse
(see Fig. 1). The electrons produced by the UV pulse
have an energy of about 1eV and therefore all leave. The
remaining electron-free potential well captures any slow
electrons that are subsequently produced. The compara-
tively few thermal electrons produced on the s-lines now
don’t escape, as in the case of Fig. 7 a), but are trapped
and trigger the ZEKE-eﬀect (note the s-lines in Fig. 7c)).

In this paper we have shown that dense, cold Rydberg
gases in a room-temperature thermal radiation ﬁeld de-
cay via the ZEKE-eﬀect, which involves the quasi-elastic
collisional production of high-l Rydberg states and un-
usually slow thermal ionization. The eﬀect hinges on
the temporary existence of a cold plasma, which acts as
a transient electron trap. The stability of the observed
phenomenon makes it likely that it represents the generic
decay pattern of cold, dense Rydberg gases. It appears
likely that the spontaneous and eﬃcient production of
high-l Rydberg states could aid the formation of con-
densed Rydberg matter [9,10]. Since it has become ap-
parent that the radiation temperature is one of the most
important parameters of the system, we intend to per-
form future studies in a cryogenic enclosure with variable
wall temperature.

Abstract. Atomic response to a probe beam can be tailored, by creating coherences between
atomic levels with help of another beam. Changing parameters of the control beam will change
the nature of coherences and hence the nature of atomic response as well. Such change can
depend upon intensity of both probe and control beams, in a nonlinear fashion. We present
a situation where this nonlinearity in dependence can be precisely controlled, as to obtain
different variations as desired. We also present a detailed analysis of how this nonlinear
dependency arises and show that this is an interesting effect of several Coherent Population
Trap(CPT) states that exist and a competition among them to trap atomic population in.

Response of a material medium to an electromagnetic ﬁeld usually exhibits a linear
dependence on the intensity, at low intensities. When the intensity is sufﬁciently high,
intensity dependant components of refractive index and absorption become dominant and the
response of the material starts becoming increasingly nonlinear. While this is usually true for
bulk medium, dilute atomic gases show a nonlinearity even at lower intensities. This is due to
the fact that a near resonant laser prepares the atom in a coherent superposition of its energy
levels. The response of an atom in such a superposition is not merely a sum of responses
from the atom in its constituent states and can be dramatically different. Thus, by creating a
superposition state, a control laser can alter the behaviour of the atom towards a probe laser
propagating through such a medium. Such coherence induced control of an atomic response
can also be interpreted as a coupling between photons of the control beam and those of the
probe beam, giving us the same picture as in traditional nonlinear optics [1],[2]. Although
a nonlinear response at higher intensities is also observed, due to anharmonic interaction
of the atom with the laser, the coherence induced nonlinearity is much more efﬁcient since
it happens at much lower intensities. This phenomena has found several applications such
as achieving giant nonlinearities [3], efﬁcient generation of of Vacuum UltraViolet (VUV)
using third harmonic[4], suppression of nonlinear responses [5], light induced focusing [6]

and many more. A fast variation of atomic response between a complete transparency to a
complete opacity can also be achieved which would effectively make an optical switch using
the medium [7].

A recent study [8] experimentally investigates several L

-like systems for dependency
of atomic response on probe intensity and shows existence of a threshold intensity where
linearity breaks down. On the other hand, we present a slightly different conﬁguration in
this paper which exhibits an almost completely nonlinear response. Further, this nonlinearity
is precisely controllable, by manipulating the intensity and frequency of the pump beam.
Our conﬁguration consists of two hyperﬁne states with quantum number F=1 and its Zeeman
manifolds, totally amounting to six levels. Such a system is often encountered in atoms such
as 87Rb or Sodium, which is used in many atom-laser experiments.
In other words, this
is a familiar system which exhibits a sufﬁciently rich nonlinear response under appropriate
conditions, as explained in this paper. We also present in detail the algorithm used to obtain
numerical solutions which describe the dynamics of this system. Due to involvement of
two lasers of slightly differing frequencies, the most used method of transformation into a
rotational frame will not eliminate explicit time-dependencies in the interaction Hamiltonian
and hence we resort to a continued fraction approach to solve them. This method, being non-
perturbative in approach is valid for any intensities of pump and probe beams. Thus, we are
not conﬁned to regimes of strong pump and weak probe alone, and are able to continuously
investigate the behaviour of the atom as probe beam’s intensity is increased from almost zero
value to a value larger than that of the pump beam. Augmenting the study with an analysis
using Semi-classical Dressed states, we are able to show that the complex response shown by
the atom is due to existence of many Coherent Population Trap (CPT) states which compete
with each other for atomic occupation.

CPT states are formed when superposition of atoms are prepared in such a superposition
of its bare states, that the probability of transitions from each of its constituent states to a
common external state cancel each other. Thus, the atom can not absorb a photon to make a
transition to the common external state is thus trapped [9]. However, there may exist other
states to which transitions not canceled, and the CPT state can be depopulated by using the
appropriate laser. Our conﬁguration, due to existence of many degenerate levels, leads to
formation of more than one CPT state. As the parameters of the lasers, such as frequency
and intensity are scanned, the atoms are transferred from one CPT state to other. The rates
of optically pumping the population to a particular CPT state or out of it depends upon the
nature of the state. Therefore, in the intermediate states, a competition between different CPT
states manifests, as to trapping the population. This phenomena is observed as a variation in
probe absorption and dispersion, which varies nonlinearly with variation of intensities of the
beam, as shown in this paper. Furthermore, the nature of nonlinear response shown to one of
the beams can be modiﬁed by varying the detuning or intensity of the other beam involved.
Thus, a precise control over the nonlinearity is possible, which may have several applications
in information processing using nonlinear properties of the medium.

This communication is divided into three parts. We describe the atomic conﬁguration
in detail in the following section, and also describe the method we have adopted to solve

the density matrix equations. In the subsequent section, we present the results obtained under
different conditions of pump and probe intensities. From this numerical results, we attempt an
insight into the phenomena that occurs. We obtain the semiclassical dressed states in section
IV and substantiate our conclusion of competition between different CPT states.

A closely resembling conﬁguration has been analyzed and reported by Petrosyan et. al.,
[2] showing an efﬁcient two-photon process occurs in the media, with one photon from the
pump beam and another from the probe. The authors present study of propagation effects
in a situation where the
levels are Zeeman shifted. Our analysis differs from
theirs in three aspects. Firstly we look at the steady state phenomena, which can model
most experiments involving cw lasers as well as very long pulses. Secondly we analyze a
nearly-degenerate system with no Zeeman shifts involved, which, as we show, exhibits a wide
variety of non-linear phenomena. Thirdly, we derive a general method for obtaining numerical
solutions of such systems with no restrictions on intensities of pump and probe beams. The
method obtains results to all orders of magnitude in pump and probe beams and hence can be
adopted even when probe and pump beams are of comparable intensities, or even when probe

These equations determine the dynamics of the different subsystems that exist in our
main system. The transfer of populations and coherences from one subsystem to the other can
be determined from here. In this paper we present results in steady state. The steady state is
described as the state that is created as a result of equilibrium reached due to the continuous
exchange of populations and coherences among different subsystems due to the incoherent
processes like collisions and spontaneous emission as well as coherent interactions due to the
two ﬁelds. Such a steady state is characterized mathematically by setting on left hand side
t ¯r (n) = 0. Using this condition leads to three term algebraic recursion relations [10], which

This completes consistent mathematical procedure used for the numerical study for
variety of cases in the six level model. The numerical procedure involves truncating the
recursion relation (11) and (12) for sufﬁciently large values of integers n and m such that the
result of (13) converge to stable values. These are then used to determine other observables of
the system using (9) and (10) above. This method, which is non-perturbative in approach,
can be used for arbitrary intensities of pump and probe beams, as long as result of (13)
converges. The methodology adopted to solve this system can be extended to study several
other conﬁgurations which involve two or more lasers and leading to time dependent terms
such as those found in this case. We could use the same mathematics to solve a more
complicated systems where the pump laser interacted resonantly with some transitions and
off-resonantly with others, which were also coupled by the probe beam. We got consistent
solutions for that system as well.

2. Results of numerical solutions

obtain total susceptibility as

Since absorption and refractive index are related to c (1) as inverse Beer length a =
2p (w /c)Imc (1) and n = 1 + 2p Rec (1) respectively, we compute real and imaginary parts
of c (1) to qualitatively study the atomic response. We present real and imaginary parts of c (1)
as a function of probe Rabi frequency W
l.
We notice a pronounced nonlinear variation of both absorption and dispersion of the probe
beam. For the graphs shown in ﬁgure 2, the pump beam is assumed to be resonant with
the
transition, while the probe beam is detuned by an amount which is thrice the
transition linewidth g ge. We do not yet understand why this precise value shows a maximum

nonlinearity. Perhaps the cause lies in the nature of different coherent superpositions that are
formed for different values of w p and w

l.

l = 10−

The curves in ﬁgure 2, which are labeled 1 to 5, correspond to different values of
5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0. Parts (a) and (c) show Imc (1), while parts (b) and (d)
show corresponding variation in Rec (1). In all of them, W
p values on the ordinate range from
5 to 5.0, i.e., we investigate situations as W
p ranges from a near-zero value, increasing
a 10−
upto becoming equal to W
l and then increasing further. All values used for computation are
normalized to the coherence decay g ge. Note that this susceptibility is calculated to ﬁrst order
in probe beam Ep but to all orders in pump beam amplitude El.

Note that each curve begins with a different value of c (1), indicating that when W

p is

p. For very large values of of W

l.
p is increased, value of c (1) is determined by instantaneous values of both W

l and
p, all curves asymptotically reach a single value of c (1),
irrespective of the W
l value. In other words, when the two Rabi frequencies differ by a large
amount, the larger of the two determine the behaviour of c (1). Varying one of them with the
other one ﬁxed will show a behaviour of c (1) as seen in curves of ﬁgure 2, indicating the
competition between two Rabi frequencies which control the behaviour.

l = 10−

Curve number 1 of ﬁgure 2a corresponds to W

p is increased. Curves 2 and 3, with W

5, which is effectively a situation
where only the probe laser is present. Appropriately, this shows a saturation of probe
absorption as W
l = 1.0 and 2.0 respectively,
show an increased absorption, which eventually saturates. Surprisingly, increasing W
l still
further leads to reduced absorption, as shown by curves 4 and 5 of the same ﬁgure. The
accompanying dispersion curves from ﬁgure 2 b show a corresponding behaviour. All the
5 curves asymptotically reach a saturation value of Re c (1)
0. But curve 1 shows an
early saturation behaviour as compared to others. Curves 2 and 3 begin with an increased
dispersion and eventually reach the saturation value, although at a much higher value of W
p.
Increasing W
l further, as shown by Curves 4 and 5, dispersion ﬂips the sign and becomes
negative throughout, eventually approaching zero asymptotically. This means that dispersion
can be varied between negative and positive values by controlling W
l, and thus a propagating
probe pulse can be compressed or expanded dynamically. Note that the absolute magnitude
of Rec (1) remains less than one, even when negative. Therefore the refractive index remains
positive for all values of W
p. However, we can control the refractive index between values
less than one and greater than one, by choosing appropriate value of W

≈

l.

Plots of ﬁgure 2c and 2d show the data for same conditions except that a collisional
decay rate of g c = 0.1 has been introduced. It is clearly seen that c (1) reaches its saturation
value for a higher value of W
p, than in case of no collisions. The numerical value of c (1) also
signiﬁcantly reduces, than its counterpart of no collision case. The qualitative behaviour of
the variation, including the changes in sign of Rec (1), remains same. It has been shown that
collisional processes destroy coherences formed and the laser that creates the coherence is
required to be stronger in order to balance this loss [11]. The effect seen here is similar, since
p to saturate c (1) when collisions are present. This is an indication that
it requires a stronger W
the phenomena is indeed driven by atomic coherence, rather than mere optical pumping.

We now look at the ’Dressed states’ to understand the behaviour seen in above graphs.

the probe absorption is different. When W

analytical expression for the dressed states since the two ﬁelds are detuned from each other.
Only when both ﬁelds are on resonance with the atomic transition and hence w

can perform rotational transformation which eliminates time dependency in Hamiltonian and
hence analytically obtain eigenvalues

identical to one found in reference [13]. The probability amplitude for
is seen to depend
upon the ratio of Rabi frequencies of the two lasers W
l. On basis of this, it can be
interpreted that the occupation probability of
state under these conditions depend upon the
relative strength of the two lasers. Intuitively extending this to the situation when w
= 0,
one can assume that the superposition state deviates only little from (23). In other words, the
occupation probability of the state
depends only on the relative intensities of the two
lasers.
The mixed states : A study of Tr(r 2) shows the distribution of atomic population among the
different CPT states. Figure 5 shows Tr(r 2) as a function of w
w p, at different situations.
The curves labeled 1 to 4 correspond to W

Tr(r 2) is close to 1.0 throughout when W

w p = 0, conﬁrms this fact. For all values in

probe detuning. It can immediately be seen that for small values of W
l, the probe absorption
is a characteristic Lorentzian function of probe detuning, as shown in ﬁgure 6 (a). When the
pump beam becomes stronger, as in ﬁgures 6(b) and 6(c), the Rabi splitting of levels due
to dynamic stark shift and onset of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency is noticed by
presence of side bands and zero absorption for w

l
It is now relevant to compare data shown in ﬁgure 6 with those in ﬁgure 2. The
w p = 3.0 in ﬁgure 2 is equivalent to a point on the abscissa of
corresponding situation of w
ﬁgure 6. Increase of W
p, as in data of ﬁgure 2, is identical to a vertical line in ﬁgure 6 over
which the point of investigation moves. It can immediately be noticed that as W
p is increased,
the peaks of Im c (1) curve traverse across this vertical line. Since this peak shape and height
also change across the curves of ﬁgure 6, it is evident that the nonlinear Im c (1) seen in ﬁgure
2 originates in this traverse of peaks across the vertical line.

w p = 0.0.

In conclusion, we have studied an atomic response to a probe beam which varies
nonlinearly with respect to the strength of probe beam. The exact trajectory of this variation
can be controlled using a control beam. The control beam is polarized orthogonally to
the probe beam and also propagates in a perpendicular direction. This allows a very easy
control of the two beams without affecting each other. The atomic system, with two sets
In short, this is a very

simple and easy to use system which allows a critical control and nonlinear variation of
atomic response. Such critical control can have applications in a wide ranging areas of
information processing, magnetometry etc. A precise control on the nonlinearity of c (1) will
allow preparation and propagation of soliton pulses within the media as well. Further, the
phenomena also involves the atom being prepared in different CPT states. This property
will be very useful in Quantum Computation where a faithful preparation of a state is
required before performing Computational operations on it. Since these states are CPT
states and constitute only ground states of the atom, such prepared states are robust against
intensity ﬂuctuations and decoherence. Thus the state remains little affected till the Quantum
Computation operations are preformed. Preparations of such states also do not require precise
pulse shaping techniques. We shall follow up with a work describing such state preparation
in detail.

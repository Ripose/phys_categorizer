Abstract. Fully numerical mesh solutions of 2D quantum equations of Schr¨odinger
and Hartree-Fock type allow us to work with wavefunctions which possess a very ﬂex-
ible geometry. This ﬂexibility is especially important for calculations of atoms and
molecules in strong external ﬁelds where neither the external ﬁeld nor the internal
interactions can be considered as a perturbation. The applications of the present ap-
proach include calculations of atoms and diatomic molecules in strong static electric
and magnetic ﬁelds. For the latter we have carried out Hartree-Fock calculations for
He, Li, C and several other atoms. This yields in particular the ﬁrst comprehensive in-
vestigation of the ground state conﬁgurations of the Li and C atoms in the whole range
of magnetic ﬁelds (0 < B < 10000 a.u.) and a study of the ground state electronic
conﬁgurations of all the atoms with 1 < Z ≤ 10 and their ions A+ in the high-ﬁeld
fully spin-polarised regime. The results in a case of a strong electric ﬁeld relate to
single-electron systems including the correct solution of the Schr¨odinger equation for
the H+
2 ion (energies and decay rates) and the hydrogen atom in strong parallel electric
and magnetic ﬁelds.

I

INTRODUCTION

Theoretical studies of atoms and molecules in strong external ﬁelds are motivated
by several applications. The latter are e.g. experiments with intense laser beams
(electromagnetic ﬁelds with dominating electric component) and astronomical ob-
servations of white dwarfs and neutron stars (magnetic ﬁelds). The experimental

availability of extremely strong electric ﬁelds in laser beams makes the theoretical
study of various atomic and molecular species under such conditions very desirable.
The properties of atomic and molecular systems in strong ﬁelds undergo dramatic
changes in comparison with the ﬁeld-free case. These changes are associated with
the strong distortions of the spatial distributions of the electronic density and cor-
respondingly the geometry of the electronic wavefunctions. This complex geometry
is diﬃcult for its description by means of traditional sets of basis functions and
requires more ﬂexible approaches which can, in particular, be provided by multi-
dimensional mesh ﬁnite-diﬀerence methods.

Let us discuss the problem of atoms in a strong magnetic ﬁeld in more detail. We
start this consideration with the hydrogen atom which was the ﬁrst atom whose
behaviour in strong magnetic ﬁelds was investigated (for a list of references see
[1–4]).
In cylindrical coordinates (ρ, z) its non-relativistic Hamiltonian has the

where m is the magnetic quantum number, sz is the spin z projection and
0 = 2.3505·105T is the magnetic ﬁeld strength in atomic
γ = B/B0, B0 = ¯hc/ea2
units. The magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the z axis. The Hamiltonian (1) contains
two potentials of diﬀerent spatial symmetries: the spherical-symmetric Coulomb
term 1/r and the cylindrically symmetric potential of the magnetic ﬁeld γ2ρ2/8.
When considering the impact of the competing Coulomb and diamagnetic interac-
tion it is reasonable to distinguish the three diﬀerent regimes of weak, strong and
intermediate ﬁelds. In the latter case the magnetic and Coulomb forces are compa-
rable. In the case of relatively weak ﬁelds the main features of the geometry of the
wavefunction are determined by the dominating Coulomb term whereas the eﬀect of
the magnetic ﬁeld can be consider as a perturbation of the Coulomb wavefunctions.
For the opposite situation of very strong magnetic ﬁelds and dominating cylindrical
symmetry the adiabatic approximation [5–7] was the main theoretical tool during
the last four decades. This approximation separately considers the fast motion of
the electron across the ﬁeld and its slow motion in a modiﬁed Coulomb potential
along the ﬁeld direction. Both early (see [8]) and more recent works [2,9–12] on the
hydrogen atom have used diﬀerent approaches for these regimes of the magnetic
ﬁeld. All these calculations had problems when considering the hydrogen atom in
ﬁelds of intermediate strength. The detailed calculations of the hydrogen energy
levels carried out by R¨osner et al [2] also retained the separation into diﬀerent
regimes of the ﬁeld strength by decomposing the electronic wave function either in
terms of spherical (weak to intermediate ﬁelds) or cylindrical (intermediate to high
ﬁelds) orbitals. A solution allowing to obtain comprehensive results on low-lying
energy levels of the hydrogen atom for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths including the in-
termediate ﬁeld regime is provided by the multi-dimensional mesh solution of the
Schr¨odinger equation [3].

For diﬀerent electronic degrees of excitation of the atom the intermediate regime
is met for diﬀerent absolute values of the ﬁeld strength. For the ground state this
regime is roughly given by γ = 0.2 − 20. For atoms with several electrons there are
two decisive factors which enrich the possible changes in the electronic structure
with varying ﬁeld strength compared to the one-electron system. First, we have a
third competing interaction which is the electron-electron repulsion and, second,
the diﬀerent electrons feel very diﬀerent Coulomb forces, i.e. possess diﬀerent one
particle energies, and consequently the regime of the intermediate ﬁeld strengths
appears to be the sum of the intermediate regimes for the separate electrons.

The fact that most methods have problems in the intermediate ﬁeld region has
consequences for the current state of the art of our knowledge on on multi-electron
atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds. There exist a number of such investigations in
the literature [6,7,13–22]. The majority of them deals with the adiabatic regime
in superstrong ﬁelds and the early works are mostly Hartree-Fock (HF) type cal-
culations. There are also several early variational calculations for the low-ﬁeld
domain [15,23,24]. HF calculations for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths have been carried
out in refs. [2,19] by applying two diﬀerent sets of basis functions in the high- and
low-ﬁeld regimes. As a result of the complicated geometry this approach suﬀers in
the intermediate regime from very slow convergence and low accuracy of the cal-
culated energy eigenvalues. Accurate HF calculations for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths
were carried out in refs. [18,20] by the 2D mesh HF method. Investigations on the
ground state as well as a number of excited states of helium including the corre-
lation energy have recently been performed via a Quantum Monte Carlo approach
[22]. Very recently benchmark results with a precision of 10−4 − 10−6 for the en-
ergy levels have been obtained for a large number of excited states with diﬀerent
symmetries using a conﬁguration interaction approach with an anisotropic Gaus-
sian basis set [25,26]. Focusing on systems with more than two electrons however
the number of investigations is very scarce [6,21,27]. In view of the above there is
a need for further quantum mechanical investigations and for data on atoms with
more than two electrons in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. For the carbon atom there exist
two investigations [6,7] in the adiabatic approximation which give a few values for
the binding energies in the high ﬁeld regime and one more relevant recent work by
Jones et al [21]. On the other hand, our two-dimensional Hartree-Fock approach
allowed us recently to perform precise and reliable consideration of a series of multi-
electron atoms for the whole range of the magnetic ﬁeld strengths from γ = 0 up
to ultrastrong ﬁelds γ = 103 − 104 [18,20,28–31].

II TWO-DIMENSIONAL MESH HARTREE-FOCK

METHOD

Our calculations for multi-electron atoms in magnetic ﬁelds are carried out under
the assumption of an inﬁnitely heavy nucleus in the (unrestricted) Hartree-Fock
approximation. The solution is established in the cylindrical coordinate system

(ρ, φ, z) with the z-axis oriented along the magnetic ﬁeld. We prescribe to each
electron a deﬁnite value of the magnetic quantum number mµ. Each single-electron
wave function Ψµ depends on the variables φ and (ρ, z)

Ψµ(ρ, φ, z) = (2π)−1/2e−imµφψµ(z, ρ)

(2)

where µ denotes the numbering of the electrons. The resulting partial diﬀerential
equations for ψµ(z, ρ) have been presented in ref. [20].

The one-particle equations for the wave functions ψµ(z, ρ) are solved by means of
the fully numerical mesh method described in refs. [3,18,20]. In our ﬁrst works on
the helium atom in magnetic ﬁelds [18,20] we calculated the Coulomb and exchange
integrals by means of a direct summation over the mesh nodes. But this direct
method is very expensive with respect to the computer time and due to this reason
we obtained in the following works [28–31] these potentials as solutions of the
corresponding Poisson equation. The problem of the boundary conditions for the
Poisson equation as well as the problem of simultaneously solving Poisson equation
on the same meshes with Schr¨odinger-like equations for the wave functions ψµ(z, ρ)
have been discussed in ref. [20].

The simultaneous solution of the Poisson equations for the Coulomb and ex-
change potentials and Schr¨odinger-like equations for the wave functions ψµ(z, ρ)
is a complicated computational problem, especially for atoms in strong magnetic
ﬁelds. The problem consists in the diﬀerent geometry of the spatial distribution
of the electron density and the potentials correspondent to this density. In strong
magnetic ﬁelds the distributions of the electronic densities are compressed towards
the z axis and look like needles directed along the z axis. The equations for the
wavefunctions can be solved in ﬁnite cylindrical domains as done in refs. [3,18,20].
For strong magnetic ﬁelds γ >> 1 these domains can be rather small in the ρ
direction. On the other hand, the potentials created by these charge distributions
cannot have such a strongly anisotropic form and the Poisson equations for them
must be solved on meshes with the distribution of nodes not very diﬀerent for the
z and ρ directions. This means some loss of the precision for the wavefunctions
due to a decrease of the number of nodes in the area of a large electronic density.
The most diﬃcult problem, however, is the diﬀerent asymptotic behaviour of the
wavefunctions and potentials. The wavefunctions of the bound electrons decrease
exponentially as r → ∞ (r is the distance from the origin). This simpliﬁes the
problem of the solution of the corresponding equations in the inﬁnite space be-
cause it is possible either to solve these equations in a ﬁnite domain Ω (with simple
boundary conditions ψ|∂Ω = 0 or ∂ψ/∂n|∂Ω = 0) with negligible errors for domains
of reasonable dimensions or otherwise to solve these equations in the inﬁnite space
on meshes with exponentially growing distances between nodes as r → ∞. The
solutions of the Poisson equations for non-zero sums of charges decrease as 1/r as
r → ∞. In result, every spatial restriction of the domain Ω introduces a signif-
icant error into the ﬁnal solution. In some other mesh Hartree-Fock approaches
developed for diatomic molecules (e.g. see [32,33]) this problem has been solved

for ﬁnite Ω by introducing special boundary conditions for the potentials obtained
from the asymptotic behaviour of the potentials. This approach, being in princi-
ple approximate, requires additional calculations with diﬀerent extensions of Ω to
estimate the error.

In the present approach we address the above problems by using special forms
of non-uniform meshes [28]. Solutions to the Poisson equation on separate meshes
contain some errors δP associated with an inaccurate description of the potential
far from the nucleus. However due to the special form of the function δP (h) for
these meshes (where h is a formal mesh step) the errors do not show up in the ﬁnal
results for the energy and other physical quantities, which we obtain by means of
the Richardson extrapolation procedure (polynomial extrapolation to h = 0 [3,41]).
The main requirement for these meshes is not an exponential, but a polynomial
increase of the mesh step h when r → ∞. Moreover, this behaviour can be only
linear one, i.e. h−1 = O(1/r) as r → ∞. The error of the mesh solution in this case
has the form of a polynomial of the formal step of the mesh ˜h = 1/N, where N is
the number of nodes along one of the coordinates. In practical calculations these
meshes are introduced by means of an orthogonal coordinate transformation from
the physical coordinates xp to the mathematical ones xm made separately for ρ
and z. And the numerical solution is, in fact, carried out on uniform meshes in the
mathematical coordinates xm. The characteristic feature of these meshes consists of
rapidly increasing coordinates of several outermost nodes when increasing the total
number of nodes and decreasing the actual mesh step in the vicinity of the origin.
Due to this property we call these meshes “Run away” meshes. To be concrete we
present here two such meshes:

1. The “Plain Poisson” mesh is generated by the coordinate transformation

xp = A

xm

1 − x2
m

(3)

−∞ < xp < +∞, −1 < xm < +1, A is a constant. This simplest mesh of this group
is near to the uniform ones near the origin (i.e. a plot of the distance between the
neighbouring nodes contains a large horizontal section close to xp = 0) and then
this mesh smoothly transforms to the “run away” behaviour for xp → ∞.

2. The “Atomic Poisson” mesh

xp = A

(|xm| + b)xm

1 − x2
m

(4)

(b > 0) allows obtaining more precise results for atoms at reasonable values of
b < 1 due to a more dense distribution of nodes near the origin. In fact, this formula
provides three diﬀerent types of behaviour in three diﬀerent domains: (a) A uniform
mesh in a small vicinity of xp = 0. This behaviour provides absence of irregularities
in the ﬁnite-diﬀerence representation of the Hamiltonian. (b) |xp| ≈ A|x2
m| - the
quadratic expansion of the mesh. (c) h−1 = O(1/r) as r → ∞. The distribution of
nodes for not too big distances from the origin (b) given by the simple formula (4)

is similar to well known “Lagrange meshes” for atoms and provide similar precision
of results. (See e.g. [34] for a deﬁnition of the “Laguerre mesh” (a mesh with nodes
at zeros of the Laguerre polynomials) as a “Lagrange mesh” suitable for systems
with the Coulomb potential and [35] (22.16.8) for approximate formulas for the
zeros of the Laguerre polynomials).

The overall precision of our results depends, of course, on the number of mesh
nodes and, if necessary, can be improved in calculations with denser meshes. The
most dense meshes which we could use in the present calculations had 120 × 120
nodes.
In most cases Richardson’s sequences of meshes with maximal number
80 × 80 or 60 × 60 were suﬃcient.

III THE STRUCTURE OF THE ATOMIC GROUND

STATE CONFIGURATIONS FOR THE LIMIT

γ → ∞

In this section we provide some qualitative considerations on the problem of the
ground states of multi-electron atoms in the high ﬁeld limit. These considerations
along with the well known electronic structure of the ground states at γ = 0
present a starting point for the combined qualitative and numerical considerations
given in the following section. At very high ﬁeld strengths the nuclear attraction
energies and HF potentials (which determine the motion along the z axis) are small
compared to the interaction energies with the magnetic ﬁeld (which determines the
motion perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld and is responsible for the Landau zone
structure of the spectrum). Thus in the limit (γ → ∞), all the one-electron wave
functions of the ground state belong to the lowest Landau zones, i.e. mµ ≤ 0 for all
the electrons, and the system must be fully spin-polarised, i.e. szµ = − 1
2 . For the
Coulomb central ﬁeld the one electron levels form quasi 1D Coulomb series with the
binding energy EB = 1
for nz > 0, whereas EB(γ → ∞) → ∞ for nz = 0, where
2n2
nz is the number of nodal surfaces of the wave function crossing the z axis. In the
limit γ → ∞ the ground state wave function must be formed of the tightly bound
single-electron functions with nz = 0. The one-particle binding energies of these
functions decrease as |m| increases and, thus, the electrons must occupy orbitals
with increasing |m| starting with m = 0.

z

In the language of the Hartree-Fock approximation the ground state wave func-
tion of an atom in the high-ﬁeld limit is a fully spin-polarised set of single-electron
orbitals with no nodal surfaces crossing the z axis and with non-positive magnetic
quantum numbers decreasing from m = 0 to m = −N + 1, where N is the number
of electrons. In result, we have for the ﬁrst 10 atoms and positive ions in the limit
γ → ∞ the following structure of ground state conﬁgurations which is a simple

We shall often refer in the following to these ground state conﬁgurations in the
high-ﬁeld limit as |0N i. The states |0N i possess the complete spin polarisation
Sz = −N/2. Decreasing the magnetic ﬁeld strength, we can encounter a series of
crossovers of the ground state conﬁguration associated with transitions of one or
several electrons from orbitals with the maximal values for |m| to other orbitals
with a diﬀerent spatial geometry of the wave function but the same spin polar-
isation. This means the ﬁrst few crossovers can take place within the space of
fully spin polarised conﬁgurations. We shall refer to these conﬁgurations by noting
only the diﬀerence with respect to the state |0N i. This notation can, of course,
also be extended to non-fully spin polarised conﬁgurations. For instance the state
1s22p−13d−24f−35g−4 with Sz = −2 of the carbon atom can be brieﬂy referred to as
|1s2i, since the default is the occupation of the hydrogenic series 1s, 2p−1, 3d−2, . . .
and only deviations from it are recorded by this notation.

IV GROUND STATE ELECTRONIC

CONFIGURATIONS OF ATOMS AND POSITIVE

IONS AT ARBITRARY FIELD STRENGTHS

Currently the carbon atom is the most complicated system with a thoroughly
investigated structure of its electronic conﬁgurations for arbitrary magnetic ﬁelds
and we start this section with a consideration of this atom.

In the case of decreasing the magnetic ﬁeld strength from very large values to
γ = 0 the fully spin-polarised ground state conﬁguration of a multi-electron atom
must undergo one or several crossovers to become ﬁnally the zero-ﬁeld ground
state conﬁguration. This conﬁguration for the carbon atom corresponds to the
spectroscopic term 3P . In the framework of the non-relativistic consideration this
term consists of nine states degenerate due to three possible z-projections of the
total spin Sz = −1, 0, 1 and three possible values of the total magnetic quantum
number M = −1, 0, 1. For very weak magnetic ﬁelds it is reasonable to expect
values Sz = −1 and M = −1 for the ground state which can be described in our

notation as 1s22s22p02p−1.

Thus the possible ground state conﬁgurations of the carbon atom can be divided
into three groups according to their total spin projection Sz : the Sz = −1 group
(low-ﬁeld ground state conﬁgurations), the intermediate group Sz = −2 and the
Sz = −3 group (the high-ﬁeld ground state conﬁgurations). This grouping is
required for the qualitative part of the following considerations which are based on
the geometry of the spatial parts of the one electron wave functions.

We start our consideration for γ 6= 0 with the high-ﬁeld ground state and sub-
sequently consider other possible candidates in question for the electronic ground
state for Sz = −3 (see Figure 1) with decreasing ﬁeld strength. All the one electron
wave functions of the high-ﬁeld ground state 1s2p−13d−24f−35g−46h−5 possess no
nodal surfaces crossing the z-axis and occupy the energetically lowest orbitals with
magnetic quantum numbers ranging from m = 0 down to m = −5. We shall refer
to the number of the nodal surfaces crossing the z axis as nz. The 6h−5 orbital pos-
sesses the smallest binding energy of all orbitals constituting the high-ﬁeld ground
state. Its binding energy decreases rapidly with decreasing ﬁeld strength. Thus,
we can expect that the ﬁrst crossover of ground state conﬁgurations happens due
to a change of the 6h−5 orbital into one possessing a higher binding energy at the
corresponding lowered range of ﬁeld strength.
It is natural to suppose that the
ﬁrst transition while decreasing the magnetic ﬁeld strength will involve a transition
from an orbital possessing nz = 0 to one for nz = 1. The energetically lowest
available one particle state with nz = 1 is the 2p0 orbital. Another possible orbital

the magnetic ﬁeld strength considered for the extraction of the ground state electronic conﬁgura-
tions with Sz = −3. Our results (solid lines) and data taken from ref.21 (broken lines). Energies
and ﬁeld strengths are given in atomic units.

into which the 6h−5 wave function could evolve is the 2s state. For the hydrogen
atom or hydrogen-like ions in a magnetic ﬁeld the 2p0 is stronger bound than the
2s orbital. On the other hand, owing to the electron screening in multi-electron
atoms in ﬁeld-free space the 2s orbital tends to be more tightly bound than the
2p0 orbital. Thus, two states i.e. the 1s2p02p−13d−24f−35g−4 state as well as the
1s2s2p−13d−24f−35g−4 conﬁguration are candidates for becoming the ground state
in the Sz = −3 set when we lower the ﬁeld strength coming from the high ﬁeld
situation.

Analogous arguments lead to the three following candidates for the ground
state in case of the second crossover in the Sz = −3 subset which takes place
with decreasing ﬁeld strength: 1s2s2p02p−13d−24f−3, 1s2p02p−13d−13d−24f−3 and
1s2s2p−13d−13d−24f−3.
It is evident that the one particle energies for the 3d−1
and 2p0 obey E3d−1 > E2p0 for all values of γ since they possess the same nodal
structure with respect to the z-axis and only the 3d−1 possesses an additional
node in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis. For this reason the conﬁguration
1s2s2p−13d−13d−24f−3 can be excluded from our considerations of the ground state.
This conclusion is fully conﬁrmed by our calculations.

Similar reasoning given in detail in ref. [30] can be repeated for two other (Sz =
−2 and Sz = −1) subsets of states and leads to the results presented in table 1 and
in Figure 2.

Figure 3 allows us to add some more informations to the considerations of the
previous section. This ﬁgure presents spatial distributions of the total electronic
densities for the ground state conﬁgurations of the carbon atom. More precisely,
it allows us to gain insights into the geometry of the distribution of the electron

and the total spin. Thereby we can understand the corresponding impact on the
total energy of the atom. The ﬁrst picture in this ﬁgure presents the distribution
of the electron density of the ground state of the carbon atom at γ = 0. The
following pictures show the distributions of the electronic densities at values of the
ﬁeld strength which mark the boundaries of the regimes of ﬁeld strengths belonging
to the diﬀerent ground state conﬁgurations. For the high-ﬁeld ground state we
present the distribution of the electronic density at the crossover ﬁeld strength
γ = 18.664 and for three additional values of γ up to γ = 1000.

For each conﬁguration the eﬀect of the increasing ﬁeld strength consists in com-
pressing the electronic distribution towards the z axis. However most of the
crossovers of ground state conﬁgurations involve the opposite eﬀect which is due to
the fact that they are associated with an increase of the total magnetic quantum

number M = P6

µ=1 mµ.

For the lithium atom the analogous arguments and calculations [29] lead to the

scheme presented in table 2.

V GROUND STATE ELECTRONIC

CONFIGURATIONS IN THE HIGH-FIELD REGIME

Let us consider now the series of neutral atoms and positive ions with Z ≤ 10
in the high ﬁeld domain which we deﬁne here as the one, where the ground state
electronic conﬁgurations are fully spin polarised (Fully Spin Polarised (FSP) regime
Sz = −N/2). The FSP regime supplies an additional advantage for calculations
performed in the Hartree-Fock approach, because our one-determinant wave func-
tions are eigenfunctions of the total spin operator S2. Starting from the high-ﬁeld
limit we investigate the electronic structure and properties of the ground states
with decreasing ﬁeld strength until we reach the ﬁrst crossover to a partially spin
polarised (PSP) conﬁguration with Sz = −N/2 + 1.

The approach to this investigation is very similar to that described in the previous
section and the picture of the crossovers associated with the ground states of atoms
and positive ions A+ is presented in table 3. It should be noted that, for atoms
with Z ≤ 6 and ions with Z ≤ 7, the state |1s2i becomes the ground state while
lowering the spin polarisation from the maximal absolute value Sz = −N/2 to
Sz = −N/2 + 1. For heavier atoms and ions we remark that the state |1s2i is not

the energetically lowest one in the PSP subset at magnetic ﬁeld strengths for which
its energy becomes equal to the energy of the lowest FSP state. For these atoms
and ions the state |1s22p0i is energetically lower than |1s2i at these ﬁeld strengths.
For atoms with Z ≥ 7 and positive ions with Z ≥ 8 the intersection points between
the state |1s22p0i and the energetically lowest state in the FSP subspace have to be
calculated. In result, the spin-ﬂip crossover occurs at higher ﬁelds than this would
be in the case of |1s2i being the lowest state in the PSP subspace. In particular, the
spin-ﬂip crossover for the neon atom is found to be slightly higher than the point of
the crossover |2p0i−|2p03d−1i, and, therefore, this atom has in the framework of the
Hartree-Fock approximation only two fully spin polarised conﬁgurations likewise
other neutral atoms and positive ions with 6 ≤ Z ≤ 10. It should be noted that
the situation with the neon atom can be regarded as a transient one due to closeness
of the intersection |2p0i − |2p03d−1i to the intersection |2p0i − |1s22p0i. This means
that we can expect the conﬁguration |2p03d−1i to be the global ground state for the
sodium atom (Z = 11). In addition an investigation of the neon atom carried out
on a more precise level than the Hartree-Fock method could also introduce some
corrections to the picture described above for this atom.

Summarising our results we remark that the atoms and positive ions with Z ≤ 5
have one FSP ground state conﬁguration |0N i whereas the atoms and ions with
6 ≤ Z ≤ 10 possess two such conﬁgurations |0N i and |2p0i.

Possessing total energies for all the atoms with Z ≤ 10 we can compare these
results with the adiabatic calculations [6,7]. Both our results (E2D) and calculations
[6,7] (E1D) are carried out in the adiabatic approximation. The diﬀerence between
E1D and E2D consists only in the usage of the adiabatic approximation for obtaining

energies E1D instead of exact solution of the Hartree-Fock equations for E2D. Thus,
the comparison of E1D and E2D allows us to evaluate the precision of the adiabatic
approximation itself and obtain an idea of the degree of its applicability for multi-
electron atoms for diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths and nuclear charges. All our values lie
lower than the values of these adiabatic calculations. It is well known, that the
precision of the adiabatic approximation decreases with decreasing ﬁeld strength.
The increase of the relative errors with decreasing ﬁeld strength is clearly visible
in the table. On the other hand, the relative errors of the adiabatic approximation
possess the tendency to increase with growing Z, which is manifested by the scaling
transformation E(Z, γ) = Z 2E(1, γ/Z 2) (e.g. [36,20]) well known for hydrogen-like
ions. The behaviour of the inner electrons is to some extent similar to the behaviour
of the electrons in the corresponding hydrogen-like ions. Therefore their behaviour
is to lowest order similar to the behaviour of the electron in the hydrogen atom at
magnetic ﬁeld strength γ/Z 2 i.e. this behaviour can be less accurately described by
the adiabatic approximation at large Z values. The absolute values of the errors
in the total energy associated with the adiabatic approximation are in many cases
larger than the corresponding values of the ionisation energies.

VI MESH APPROACH FOR SINGLE-ELECTRON

ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR SYSTEMS IN

STRONG ELECTRIC FIELDS

In this section we present some features of our approach With respect to its
application to systems in strong external electric ﬁelds and correspondingly some
relevant physical results.
In contrast to the situation discussed in the previous
sections atoms and molecules in external uniform electric ﬁelds have no stationary
states, because for every state there is a probability that one or several electrons
leave the system. Thus, when switching on the external uniform electric ﬁeld, all
the stationary states turn into resonances. Using the complex form of the energy
eigenvalues

E = E0 − iΓ/2

one may consider quasi-stationary states of quantum systems similarly to the sta-
tionary ones. In this approach the real part of the energy E0 is the centre of the
band corresponding to the quasi-stationary state and the imaginary part Γ/2 is the
half-width of the band which determines the lifetime of the state. In this communi-
cation we consider systems which can be described by two-dimensional one-electron
Hamiltonians. These systems include the hydrogen atom and the H+
2 molecular ion
in an electric ﬁeld [37–39] and the hydrogen atom in parallel electric and magnetic
ﬁelds [39,40]. The only electron present in such a system can leave it under impact
of the external electric ﬁeld. From the mathematical point of view the problem
consists in obtaining solutions of the single-particle Schr¨odinger equation for this

electron with the correct asymptotic behaviour of the wavefunction as an outgoing
wave. Currently we have three diﬀerent possibilities for ﬁxing this asymptotics
realised in our computational program:

1. Complex boundary condition method. This method is described in detail in ref.
[38]. The method is based on the fact that the single-electron Schr¨odinger equation
for a ﬁnite system can be solved with the arbitrary precision in a ﬁnite area both
for stationary and for quasi-stationary eigenstates. The case of stationary states is
considered in [41,3]. The approach for the quasi-stationary states will be discussed
following [38]. Figure 5 presents the potential curve for the simplest Hamiltonian
of the hydrogen atom in an electric ﬁeld

F is the electric ﬁeld strength multiplied by the charge of the electron. Analogously
to [40,3] the calculations can be carried out in an area Ω which is ﬁnite along the
direction z. For this coordinate we used uniform meshes. The boundary of the
area z = −Lz− for z < 0 (F ≥ 0) (Figure 5) is determined from the condition of
small values of the wavefunction on the boundary and, therefore, small perturba-
tions introduced by the corresponding boundary condition [3]. The values of the
wavefunction on the opposite boundary of the area (z = Lz+) cannot be excluded
from the consideration. We consider non-stationary states of the system decaying
into continuum of free particles. In this process an electron leaves the system in
direction z → +∞ and, thus, an outgoing wave boundary condition is to be estab-
lished on z = Lz+. The form of this boundary condition can be derived from the
asymptotic behaviour of the wavefunction for z → +∞ and has the form

electric ﬁeld.

where k = [2(E+F z)]1/2 is the wavenumber. Solving the Schr¨odinger equation with
the Hamiltonian (5) and the boundary condition (6) established on a reasonable
distance Lz+ from the origin of the system we can obtain the complex eigenvalues
of the energy and the wavefunctions of the type presented in the Figure 6.

This straightforward approach enables obtaining precise results both for atoms
and molecules from weak to moderate strong ﬁelds (for instance for the ground
state of the hydrogen atom up to F = 0.20 − 0.25 a.u.).

2. Classical complex rotation of the coordinate z in the form z → zeiΘ. In this
approach we have obtained precise results for atomic systems in strong ﬁelds from
the lower bound of the over-barrier regime up to superstrong ﬁelds correspond-
ing to regime |ReE| << |ImE| [39]. On the other hand, this method cannot be
immediately applied to molecular systems in our direct mesh approach [42,39].

3. Exterior complex transformation of the coordinate z. In our numerical ap-
proach we transform the real coordinate z into a curved path in the complex plane
z. This transformation leaves intact the Hamiltonian in the internal part of the
system, but supplies the complex rotation of z (and the possibility to use the zero
asymptotic boundary conditions for the wavefunction) in the external part of the
system. The transformation can be applied both for atoms and molecules and pro-
vides precise results for ﬁelds from weak up to superstrong with some decrease of
the numerical precision in the regime |ReE| << |ImE| [39].

The numerical results obtained by all three methods coincide And are in agree-
ment with numerous published data on the hydrogen atom in electric ﬁelds (see
e.g. [43–46] and references in [38]).

Some of our results for the hydrogen atom in parallel electric and magnetic ﬁelds

[39] are shown in Table 4.

The second system which we present in this section is the hydrogen molecular
ion H+
2 in a strong longitudinal electric ﬁeld. Our approach allowed us to carry out
the ﬁrst correct consideration of this system [37] and, in particular, to obtain the
potential curves of its ground state, presented in Figure 7 (left). The minima in
these curves give the equilibrium internuclear distances, presented in this Figure
(right) as a function of the electric ﬁeld strength. One can see that at a critical
value of the electric ﬁeld about 0.065 a.u. the minimum disappears and, thus, above
this critical value the hydrogen molecular ion cannot exist. This critical value of
the maximal electric ﬁeld Fc = 0.065a.u. = 3.3V/˚A for the molecule H+
2 is in a good
agreement with experimental results by [47]. According this work H+
2 molecule may
exist in laser beam ﬁelds with intensity less than 1014W/cm2 which corresponds to
3V/˚A, and does not exist in more intense ﬁelds.

VII CONCLUSIONS

In this communication we have presented a 2D fully numerical mesh solution
method in its various applications to atoms and simple diatomic molecules in strong
external electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Speciﬁcally these are calculations of atoms
with Z ≤ 10 and their positive ions in strong magnetic ﬁelds and the comprehensive
investigation of the electronic structure of the ground states of the Li and C atoms
in arbitrary magnetic ﬁelds. For the carbon atom seven diﬀerent electronic ground
state conﬁgurations for diﬀerent domains of the magnetic ﬁeld strength have been
found. The investigation of the series of atoms with Z ≤ 10 in very strong magnetic
ﬁelds enables us to evaluate the applicability of the adiabatic approximation and
to show its decreasing precision for heavier atoms.

The mathematical technique developed for solving Schr¨odinger equations for
quasi-steady states allowed us to obtain a series of results for the hydrogen atom
in parallel electric and magnetic ﬁelds and for the H+
2 ion in strong electric ﬁelds.
Thus, the method described above allows us to obtain a number of new physical
results partially presented in this communication. These calculations are carried
out in the Hartree-Fock approximation for multi-electron systems and are exact
solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation for the single-electron case. As the following
development of the method we plan to implement the conﬁguration interaction
approach in order to study correlation eﬀects in multi-electron systems both in
electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

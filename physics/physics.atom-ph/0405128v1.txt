Abstract

A program RCFP will be presented for calculating standard quantities in the de-
composition of many–electron matrix elements in atomic structure theory. The list of
quantities wich are supported by the present program includes the coeﬃcients of frac-
tional parentage, the reduced coeﬃcients of fractional parentage, the reduced matrix
elements of the unit operator T (k) as well as the completely reduced matrix elements of
the operator W (kj kq) in jj–coupling. These quantities are now available for all subshells
(nj) with j ≤ 9/2 including partially ﬁlled 9/2–shells. Our program is based on a recently
developed new approach on the spin–angular integration which combines second quanti-
zation and quasispin methods with the theory of angular momentum in order to obtain
a more eﬃcient evaluation of many–electron matrix elements. An underlying Fortran
90/95 module can directly be used also in (other) atomic structure codes to accelerate
the computation for open–shell atoms and ions.

age, reduced matrix element, relativistic, second quantization, standard unit tensors, tensor

Nature of the physical problem:
The calculation of atomic properties and level structures is based on the evaluation of many–
particle matrix elements of physical operators. For symmetry–adapted functions, the matrix
element for a given tensor operator A(K) of rank K can be expressed as

j,k coeﬀ(j, k) < γjJj||A(K)||γkJk > by using the (reduced) coeﬃcients of fractional parent-
age and the reduced matrix elements of the (unit) standard tensors T (k) or W (kqkj ). These

reduced coeﬃcients and matrix elements are frequently applied to both the conﬁguration
interaction and multi–conﬁguration Dirac–Fock method [2] as well as to many–body pertur-
bation theory [3].

Method of solution:
A new combination of second quantization and quasispin methods with the theory of angular
momentum and irreducible tensor operators leads to a more eﬃcient evaluation of (many–
particle) matrix elements and to faster computer codes [4]. Practical implementations of
this new scheme will support not only large–scale computations on open–shell atoms but
may even help to develop programs for calculating the angular parts of (eﬀective) one– and
two–particle operators for many–body perturbation theory (in higher orders) in the future.

Restrictions onto the complexity of the problem:
For jj–coupled subshells states, our module provides coeﬃcients and matrix elements for all
subshells (nj) with j = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, 7/2, and 9/2.

Typical running time:
For large computations, the running time depends on the shell structure and the size of the
wave function expansion for a given atomic system. However, the program promptly responds
in its interactive mode if only single coeﬃcients and matrix elements are to be calculated.

Unusual features of the program:
The interactive version of RCFP can be used as an ”electronic tabulation” of standard quan-
tities for evaluating general matrix elements for jj–coupled functions.

Introduction

In atomic structure theory, the eﬃcient evaluation of many–electron matrix elements play
a crucial role. Typically, such matrix elements have to be evaluated for diﬀerent one– and
two–particle operators which describe the interaction of the electrons with each other or
with external particles and ﬁelds. By exploiting the techniques of Racah’s algebra [1], the
evaluation of these matrix elements may often be considerably simpliﬁed by carrying out the
integration over the spin–angular coordinates analytically. For atoms with open shells, several
approaches to this analytic integration were developed in the past. One of the most widely–
used computational schemes is from Fano [2, 3] and has been implemented in a number of
powerful programs [4, 5] since that time.
Fano’s procedure [2] is based on the coeﬃcients of fractional parentage (cfp). During the last
decades, this procedure was applied both to LS– and jj–coupling; in the following, we will
restrict ourselves to jj–coupling as appropriate for relativistic calculations. By using the cfp
as the basic quantities, however, Fano’s procedure does not exploit the full power of Racah’s
algebra. Instead of using cfp, it is often more convenient to exploit unit tensors [6, 7] which are
closer related to the tensorial form of physical operators. But so far, unit tensors have been
applied only for evaluating diagonal matrix elments while all non–diagonal matrix elements
still have to be evaluated by using the cfp [7, 8]. A recently developed approach [9, 10] now
treats diagonal and non–diagonal matrix elements on a uniform basis. This approach is based
on a second quantization and uses a coupled tensorial form for the creation and annihilation
operators [11]. It also applies the theory of angular momentum to two diﬀerent spaces, i.e.
the space of orbital angular momentum j and the quasispin space [12]. The basic quantities
of this new approach are the so–called reduced coeﬃcients of fractional parentage (rcfp) and
the completely reduced matrix elements of the W (kqkj) operator.
Obviously, each computational scheme is based on a set of standard quantities to decompose
the many–electron matrix elements. These quantities are either the cfp, rcfp, the reduced
matrix elements of the unit tensor T (k), the completely reduced matrix elements W (kqkj ),
depending on the approach. Therefore, very diﬀerent tabulations of these quantities are
found in the literature. For example, numerical values for the cfp are found by Shalit and
Talmi [13] for subshells with j = 5/2, 7/2 and 9/2 while rcfp for j = 5/2 and 7/2 were
ﬁrst tabulated by Saviˇcius et al [14]. Matrix elements of T (k) are tabulated, for instance, by
Slepcov et al [15] for subshells with j = 3/2, 5/2 and 7/2; often, however, it is more convenient
to express these matrix elements in terms of the completely reduced matrix elements of the
operator W (kqkj) even though no explicit compilation of these matrix elements yet available.
In practical applications, they are instead derived from a sum of products of rcfp and 6–j
symbols.
In this paper, we will present the program RCFP for the calculation of the standard quantities
both in Fano’s and our new approach. These quantities are needed for the integration over

4

the spin–angular variables. Our program not only supports large–scale computations on
open–shell atoms but may even help to develope codes for calculating the angular parts of
(eﬀective) one– and two–particle operators from many–body perturbation theory (in higher
orders) in the future.
The theoretical background will be presented in section 2. This includes a brief outline of
the quasispin concept, the deﬁnitions of the rcfp and the reduced matrix elements of the unit
tensors W (kqkj) and T (k) as well as the proper classiﬁcation of subshells in jj–coupling. The
program organization will be dealt with in section 3 while, ﬁnally, a few examples are given
in section 4.

2 Theoretical background

The theory of angular integration for symmetry–adapted functions has been reviewed in
several texts and monographs [3, 7, 10, 16]. As mention above, this theory is usually built
on a number of standard quantities like the cfp or the reduced matrix elements of the unit
tensor T (k) which, in turn, can be applied to lay down the expressions for more complex
matrix elements. Other important quantities (which are also provided by our program) are
the rcfp and the completely reduced matrix elements of the tensor operators W (kqkj).
In
the following, we shall not repeat too many details about this angular integration on the
spin–angular coordinates; instead, we just list the deﬁnition of those quantities which can
be obtained from our program along with a number of useful relations among them. For all
further details, we ask the reader to refer to the literature given above.

In the literature, several deﬁnitions and phase conventions are used for deﬁning the standard
quantities for angular integration. Here, we follow the deﬁnitions from Saviˇcius [14] and from
Kaniauskas and Rudzikas [12]. We also apply the so–called standard–phase systems,

mk = (−1)k−mk A(k)
A(k)†
−mk

throughout this paper which were originally introduced by Fano and Racah [17].

2.1 The quasispin concept

In jj−coupling, a wave function for a subshell of N equivalent electrons with principal quan-
tum number n and (one–electron) angular momentum j is often written as

where J denotes the total angular momentum and α all additional quantum numbers as
needed for an unique classiﬁcation of these states. Using the quasispin concept, a further
(angular) quantum number Q, the quasispin momentum of the subshell, can be introduced
so that the wave function of this subshell (to which we brieﬂy refer to as a subshell state)
then reads

(1)

(2)

(3)

|njN αJ)

|njN αQJ) .

5

2j+1

For any given subshell, the quasispin Q is closely related to the seniority quantum number ν as
used in the seniority scheme, i.e. Q =
/2. If compared with the seniority notation
the quasispin Q to has the advantage of its projection, MQ, being related to the occupation
number N by MQ =
/2. Therefore, when exploring the quasispin concept for
classifying the atomic subshell states (3), the Wigner–Eckart theorem can be applied twice,
both to the space of quasispin (Q–space) as well as to the total angular momentum (J–space).
Hence, any reduced matrix element in J–space can be further reduced also in Q–space [12]

to a so–called completely reduced matrix element.
mq denotes a tensor with
rank q and projection mq in the Q−space. As seen from its notation the completely reduced
matrix element
is independent of the occupation number N of the
particular subshell states; the occupation number N of these states occurs explicitly only on
the left–hand–side of Eq. (4) while it is incorporated into Q on the right–hand side. Thus,
by applying the quasispin concept, the evaluation of general matrix elements will result in a
much smaller number of completely reduced matrix elements which are independent of the
occupation of electrons N in this subshell but still allows an unique decomposition.

The electron creation a(j)

second quantization and atomic structure [18]. Using the quasispin concept, the operators

The properties of the rcfp have been summarized by Saviˇcius et al [14] and Gaigalas et

the literature to subshell states with a the same number N (< j + 1/2) of electrons or holes,
respectively.

2.3 Reduced matrix elements of standard operators

The unit tensors W (kqkj) and T (k) are other standard quantities in atomic spectroscopy. Many
texts on the evaluation of matrix elements in many–particle physics frequently refer to these
quantities [6, 7]. The tensor W (kqkj ), for example, is deﬁned as the tensorial product of two
creation operators in second quantization

Since the completely reduced matrix elements
of the opera-
tor W (kqkj) are, again, independent of the occupation number, they allow for a more compact
(cid:16)
representation (tabulation) in atomic structure calculations. This fact becomes important,
in particular, when calculating atoms with open d− and/or f −shells. So far, no detailed
analysis or tabulation of these completely reduced matrix elements in jj−coupling has been
published in the literature or has been implemented in any atomic structure code.

(cid:17)

2.4 Classiﬁcation of subshells in jj–coupling

A unique classiﬁcation of the atomic states and, hence, the subshell states is required for
all structure computations. For subshells with j = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, and 7/2, two quantum
numbers Q and J (respectively, ν and J in the seniority notation) are suﬃcient to classify
the subshell states for all allowed occupation numbers N unambiguously. For these subshells,
no additonal quantum numbers α are then needed to be speciﬁed in (3). By contrast, some
additional number(s) are required for classifying the subshell states for j ≥ 9/2 [cf. Shalit
and Talmi [13] or Grant [3]]. For j = 9/2, there are two doublets (pairs of subshell states)
with ν = 4, J = 4 and ν = 4, J = 6 in the [9/2]4 and [9/2]6 conﬁgurations which require an
additional ”number” in order to classify these states uniquely. To distinguish the individual
subshell states of these two pairs, we use the number N r = 1 or N r = 2 beside of the standard
quantum numbers Q and J, respectively, ν and J. Table 1 lists all (jj−coupled) subshell
states for j = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, 7/2 and 9/2, starting for each j with the lowest occupation
number.

T (k). It can be applied interactively, for instance, for calculating a few individual coeﬃcients
or matrix elements in some theoretical derivation but also, by using the underlying module
rabs rcfp, in any relativistic atomic structure calculations in order to evaluate all required
(many–electron) matrix elements automatically. RCFP is written in Fortran 90/95 and is
designed as additional component of the RATIP package [21] as will be explained in subsection
3.3. By exploiting the advantages of the new Fortran 90/95 standard, we deﬁned several
derived data types which facilitate the work and which shall enable us to incorporate this
module in our present developments on large–scale computations for open–shell atoms and
ions. The deﬁnition of the various derived structures can be found in the header of the module
rabs rcfp but will not be explained here.

As seen from section 2, the most basic quantities for evaluating matrix elements among
diﬀerent subshell states are the rcfp and the completely reduced matrix elements of W (kqkj ).
These quantities are more general than the cfp or the reduced matrix elements of the unit
tensor T (k) as they do not depend on the occupation number in the corresponding shells.
Thus, the rcfp and the completely reduced matrix elements can be tabulated much easier for
subshells with j ≤ 7/2 or even j = 9/2 and are also applied in the present program. This is
in contrast to most earlier atomic structure codes which are built on the cfp. For j ≤ 7/2, the
rcfp have been taken from Rudzikas [7] while the corresponding tables for j = 9/2 have been
created by us using Eq. (7) and the tabulations by Shalit and Talmi [13] for the cfp. Similarly,
a tabulation of the completely reduced matrix elements of W (kqkj) have been obtained from
the reduced matrix elements of T (k) [15] and from the two relations (12) and (13) for the
subshells with j ≤ 7/2. Up to the present, the module rabs rcfp does not contain a full
tabulation of the completely reduced matrix elements of W (kqkj) for j = 9/2 even though
such an implementation might help considerably in the future in order to accelarate structure
calculations on atoms having open g 9/2 and/or h 9/2 subshells. At present, these coeﬃcients
are calculated from Eq. (11) each time they are needed. Also, the values of the cfp and the
reduced matrix elements of T (k) are calculated from Eqs. (7) or (12) and (13), respectively.

3.2 Interactive work

The program RCFP is typically applied in its interactive mode.
In this mode, it replies
immediately to the input as typed in by the user. In the next section, we display several
short dialogs for calculating individual coeﬃcients and matrix elements. From the main menu
of the RCFP component (see Fig. 1),
we need ﬁrst to select the type of the quantity which is to be computed. For example, by
entering 1 on the screen the user can calculate any cfp in jj–coupling for subshells with
j ≤ 9/2. Similarly, a 2 supports the computation of rcfp, and so on. Finally, a q will
terminate the program.

The input of the required quantum numbers needed for the computation of any quantity
is facilitated by the program.
It is only necessary to type those quantum numbers which
cannot be derived automatically and which distinguish the individual coeﬃcients and matrix
elements. For calculating a cfp or a reduced matrix elements of T (k), for instance, the orbital

quantum number j, the subshell occupation number N , the seniority quantum number ν,
and the subshell total angular momentum J is needed in order to specify the bra–function
uniquely. Only if additional quantum numbers are indeed required for a unique classiﬁcation
of the subshell states, the program will ask for the quantum number N r. A number of
examples will illustrated the usage of RCFP below in section 4.

3.3 Distribution and installation of the program

RCFP has been developed as (a new) component of the RATIP package [21]. To facilitate the
combination with this package, RCFP will be distributed as an archive ﬁle of the directory
ratip rcfp. From this archive, ﬁrst of all the ﬁle structure is reconstructed by the com-
mand tar -xvf ratip rcfp.tar on a UNIX workstation or any compatible environment.
The directory ratip rcfp then contains the Fortran 90/95 module rabs rcfp.f, the (main)
program xrcfp.f as well as the makeﬁle make-rcfp. It also includes a number of examples in
the subdirectory test-rcfp and a short Read.me which explains further details about the in-
stallation. Since the same ﬁle structure is preserved in both cases, the combination of RCFP
with RATIP is simply achieved by running the command cp -r ratip rcfp/. ratip/. —
Inside of the RATIP root directory, then make -f make-rcfp will generate the executable
xrcf, similarly as for the other two components xcesd99 [22] and xreos99 [21] of the RATIP
package. Like before, the name of the (Fortran 90/95) compiler and special compiler ﬂags
can be overwritten in the header of the makeﬁle. Although RCFP makes use of four other
modules which are part already of RATIP, no further adaptation of the program is needed.
At present, the RCFP program has been installed and tested under the operating systems
Linux and AIX but, owing to the compliance of the Fortran 90/95 standard, no diﬃculties
should arise on any other platform.

The subdirectory test-rcfp lists a number of examples which demonstrate the usage of the
program. To each item in the main menu in Fig. 1, a short ﬁle displays the full dialog to
compute one or several individual coeﬃcients or (completely reduced) matrix elements. The
ﬁle show-cfp-dialog, for instance, reports the calculation of several cfp for subshells with

11

j = 9/2 including an example for which the (additional) quantum number Nr need to be
speciﬁed.

Apart from the application of rabs rcfp in the RCFP program, this module can be used
also in other programs which, in the future, will provide the angular coeﬃcients for general
matrix elements of one– and two–particle operators for jj−coupled functions.

4 Examples

To illustrate the use of RCFP in its interactive mode, we show three examples concerning
the calculation of rcfp and matrix elements. We will just display the input (which has to be
typed in by the user) along with the given reply by the program. In order to support also an
occasional usage of the program, the notation of the various coeﬃcients and matrix elements
is kept as close as possible with their printed form [cf. section 2]. Moreover, all information
which can automatically be deduced by the program is simply provided by typing Enter at
input time. For an improper selection of quantum numbers or any incomplete information, a
short message is printed explaining the failure before all previous (correct) input is repeated.
This saves the user from re-enter all of the previously typed input just because of one single
(mistyped) quantum number.
In the following examples, we display the user’s input in
boldface mode while the response of the program is shown in normal text mode.

Our ﬁrst examples displays the computation of the cfp
[7/2]4, ν = 2, J = 2 {| [7/2]3, ν = 3, J = 3/2, ν = 1, j = 7/2

In our third example, ﬁnally, we ask for the value of one of the completely reduced matrix
element of the W (10) operator, i.e. (j = 9/2, ν = 4, J = 6, N r = 2 ||| W (10) ||| j = 9/2, ν =
4, J = 6, N r = 2). As mentioned in section 2, an additional quantum number N r is required

for a unique speciﬁcation of the subshells states with j = 9/2. Here, we start by selecting
item 3 from the main menu.

A very similar dialog occurs for the computation of any other coeﬃcient or reduced matrix
element. In conclusion, RCFP has been developed as a new component of the RATIP package
which enables the user to calculate standard quantities in the evaluation of many–electron
matrix elements explicitly. In the future, the underlying Fortran 90/95 module rabs rcfp
will be exploited also to calculate the Hamiltonian matrix and further properties of free atoms
from jj−coupled conﬁguration state functions. The deﬁnition of the rcfp and the completely
reduced matrix elements and further improvements (see Gaigalas et al [9]) will allow for faster
and more convinient computations than it is presently supported by standard atomic structure
programs. A module for calculating the angular coeﬃcients for jj−coupled functions with
respect to any (given) scalar two–particle operator is currently under development.

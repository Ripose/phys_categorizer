We investigate a new type of quantum ratchet which may be realised by cold atoms in a double-well
optical lattice which is pulsed with unequal periods. The classical dynamics is chaotic and we ﬁnd
the classical diﬀusion rate D is asymmetric in momentum up to a ﬁnite time tr. The quantum
behaviour produces a corresponding asymmetry in the momentum distribution which is ‘frozen-
in’ by Dynamical Localization provided the break-time t∗ ≥ tr. We conclude that the cold atom
ratchets require Db/~ ∼ 1 where b is a small deviation from period-one pulses.

Cold atoms in optical lattices provide an excellent ex-
perimental demonstration of the phenomenon of Dynam-
ical Localization [1]. Dynamical Localization (DL) has
been described as the so-called ‘quantum suppression of
classical chaos’. More precisely, in the usual realisations,
a periodically-driven or kicked system is associated with
classically chaotic dynamics for suﬃciently strong pertur-
bation. Its average energy grows diﬀusively and without
limit, whereas for the corresponding quantum system the
diﬀusion is suppressed after an ~-dependent timescale,
the ‘break-time’ t∗. The ﬁnal quantum momentum dis-
tribution is localized with a characteristic exponential
proﬁle. The formal analogy established with Anderson
Localization [2] forms a key analysis of this phenomenon.
A series of recent experiments on Cesium atoms [3]
gave a classic demonstration of this eﬀect for atoms in
driven or pulsed lattices of sinusoidal form. The possi-
bility of experiments with asymmetric lattices, in par-
ticular with asymmetric double wells
leads us
to investigate the possibility of constructing a ’clean’
atomic ratchet, where the transport results purely from
the chaotic Hamiltonian dynamics, with no Brownian or
dissipative ingredients.

[4,5],

There is already an extensive body of work on Brow-
nian ratchets [6], driven by the need to understand bio-
physical systems such as molecular motors and certain
mesoscopic systems. Some of this work encompasses the
quantum dynamics [7]. However, to date there has been
very little work on Hamiltonian ratchets. One notable
exception is the work by Flach et al
[8] where the gen-
eral form of the spatial and temporal desymmetrization
required to generate transport was investigated. To our
knowledge, the only substantial study of quantum Hamil-
tonian ratchets to date, however, is the work of Dittrich
et al
[9] which concluded that transport occurs in mixed
phase-spaces. They demonstrated that overall transport
(in their system with periodic boundary conditions) is
zero if starting conditions cover all regions of phase-space
(including stable islands and chaotic regions) uniformly.
A key result was a sum rule which exploited the fact that
transport in the chaotic manifold is balanced by trans-
port in nearby regular manifolds (stable islands/tori).
Very recenty [10], it was shown that a kicked map with
a ‘rocking’ linear potential leads conﬁnenement in the
chaotic region between a pair of tori which are not sym-

1

metrically located about p = 0.

Here we propose a new type of Hamiltonian quantum
ratchet which, classically, is completely chaotic. This
ratchet is fully consistent with the rules established by
Dittrich et al , but relies on a diﬀerent mechanism: the
transport is due to a non-uniform momentum distribu-
tion within a completely chaotic phase-space. To our
knowledge, this is the only example of a clean, non-
dissipative ratchet which does not rely on speciﬁc dy-
namical features such as a particular sets of islands/tori.
The basic mechanism is as follows: for a repeating cycle
of kicks perturbed from period-one by a small parameter
b, we ﬁnd that the classical diﬀusion rates for positive and
negative momenta (D+ and D− respectively) are diﬀer-
ent up to a ﬁnite time. Up to this time, an asymmetry in
the classical momentum distribution Ncl(p) accumulates
with kick number. But, beyond this ‘ratchet’ time, tr,
the rates equalize ,we have D+
D (where D is

ef f /2 ), no more symme-
the total diﬀusion rate D
∼
try accumulates and the net classical momentum < pcl >
becomes constant. But < p2
cl >, of course, continues to
Dt. We ﬁnd that the corresponding
grow with time as
quantum current depends on t∗/tr : if the break time is
too short no asymmetry in the quantum Nqm(p) accu-
mulates and there is no quantum transport. If t∗ >> tr
the localisation length L becomes large and the eﬀec-
tive quantum momentum asymmetry

In Fig.1 we compared the evolution of a quantum
wavepacket with equal kick times (Ti = 1) with a cor-
responding unequal-kick case with N = 3, b = 0.1. Since
V (x) in general represents a double well potential, we
refer to it as the dw-QKR to distinguish it from the
standard map case with V = K sin x. For convenience
and by analogy with optical terminology, we refer to the
unequal-kick case as the ‘chirped’ or cdw-QKR. N = 3 is
the minimum number needed to break time-reversal in-
variance: N = 2 in this system gives no transport. Larger
numbers (N > 3) do give transport but have the eﬀect
of increasing break-times, which, as discussed below, we
wish to keep small.

The upper graph in Fig.1 shows that, for both equally
and unequally kicked double-well potentials, the average
energy of a classical ensemble of particles grows linearly
with time t , ie < P 2 >
Dt. Neglecting all corre-
ef f /2 =
lations, it is approximated by D
D0 ∼
Kp(1 + 4a2). The Φ dependence appears in neglected
correlations which in this case appear as products of
Bessel functions [11]. For the standard QKR the correc-
tions appear as oscillations in D(K), with the maxima
corresponding to the K ′s for which accelerator modes are
important . They were observed experimentally in [12].
We ﬁnd that these corrections are unimportant for the
cdw-QKR : the lowest order approximation gives a good
ﬁt from quite low values of K. The equal-kick case, the
dw-QKR does need substantial corrections. In fact, since
for the cdw-QKR phase-space periodicity in momentum
is largely destroyed and indeed we ﬁnd no evidence of
accelerator modes; the dw-QKR is periodic in p and we
ﬁnd strong eﬀects due to accelerator modes.

The break-time is substantially longer however (typically

We ﬁnd that t∗ grows as N . The ﬁgure shows that there
is no net momentum in the T = 1 case and, asymptot-

iments in [3] measured the momentum distribution of
a cloud of atoms and observed the hallmark of DL : a
triangular form of the logarithm of the momentum dis-
tribution N (p). Fig 1(c) (upper) shows this is also the
case for the dw-QKR. However, for the chirped case, the

FIG. 2. Behaviour of the cdw-QKR. The results were ob-
tained from quantum wavepackets and classical trajectories.
Both the classical and quantum < p > reach a constant value
after a ﬁnite time (t∗ and tr respectively). (a) Graph show-
ing that the quantum ratchet transport is very sensitive to
~ if the quantum wavepacket localizes before the classical
wavepacket reaches tr. The values of ~, (0.8 → 0.125) are
indicated. K = 1.6, a = 1/2, N = 3 (hence D ∼ 2.5) and
b = 0.1. The asymptotic quantum < p > increases with ~
and ‘catches’ up with the classical results for ~ ∼ 0.25. (b)

cal diﬀusion rates (D+(t, b), D−(t, b)): < p2 > is evaluated
separately for positive and negative momenta for a cloud of
classical particles with D ∼ 2.5 and diﬀerent b. We see that
the growth in < p2 > shows a divergence from linear growth
which, for small bp< p2 >, is similar in magnitude but oppo-
site in sign for the negative and positive components. The +

if t > tr then D+ ∼ D− ∼ D ∼ 2.5. The lower graphs show

Fig 2b shows that, for a given b (b = 0.1 in this
graph), the classical saturation time falls with D. The
fact that < pcl > saturates at all is surprising: after
all, the ensemble of classical trajectories is continually
expanding and exploring new phase-space regions corre-
sponding to higher momenta. Hence speciﬁc dynamical
features such as partial barriers (cantori) do not account
for this ratchet eﬀect, though we ﬁnd ‘scars’ of cantori
do aﬀect the detail of N (p).

We solve the classical dynamics of the dw-QKR with
the usual map , xi+1 = xi + Pi ; Pi+1 = Pi + V ′(xi+1) for
the i
th kick. For the chirped case, however, we have
a 3-kick map ( we consider N = 3 here but the analysis
for N > 3 is qualitatively similar). We consider the ﬁrst
kick of the n

The eﬀect of the chirping is to allow the free evolution to
proceed for an additional distance δ1 = Pn0b. The second
kick has corresponding δ2 = 0 and the third kick has
δ3 =

a small perturbation at the start of the evolution of the

In general, if we work out the change in < p2 > for
successive kicks in the standard map we obtain a diﬀu-
sion rate D which is the same (after the ﬁrst few kicks)
whether we average the momentum from 0
or from
. Both the zero-th order contribution K 2/2 as
0
well as higher corrections such as C(2) (involving corre-
lations between the i

or C(3) etc, are even in p and insensitive to the sign of
p. However, in the cdw-QKR case, if we can make the
perturbative expansion above, we now have correlations
which depend on the sign of p and which scale with b.

much smaller than the classical values but increase in
magnitude until there is a ’cross-over’ point at D

after which they are much closer to the classical values.
We do not expect perfect agreement with the classical

In conclusion, we have found a mechanism for a
generic, completely chaotic Hamiltonian ratchet. But
much remains to be done, such as considering the ef-
fect of the partial loss of coherence in the experiment or
the eﬀect of the ﬁnite duration of the experimental kicks.
Though transport appears as a general sign-dependent
correction to the classical diﬀusion rate , the role of spe-
ciﬁc dynamical eﬀects such as desymmetrization of Levy
ﬂights [8] must be investigated.

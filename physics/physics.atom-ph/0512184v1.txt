We present a four-mode model that describes coherent photo-association (PA) in a double-well
Bose-Einstein condensate, focusing on the average molecular populations in certain parameters.
Our numerical results predict an interesting strong-damping eﬀect of molecular oscillations by
controlling the particle tunnellings and PA light strength, which may provide a promising way for
creating a stable molecular condensate via coherent PA in a magnetic double-well potential.

The remarkable realizations of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in cold dilute atomic gases have

provided a rich playground to manipulate and demonstrate various properties of quantum degenerate

gases [1]. Recently rapid advances have been witnessed for creating a quantum degenerate molecular

gase via a magnetic Feshbach resonance [2-3] or an optical photo-association (PA) [4-5] in an atomic

BEC, and the appealing physical properties of the formed atom-molecule mixtures were investigated

very extensively under the quasi-homogeneous trapping conditions [2-5]. The coherent PA process not

only produces a new species of BEC but also leads to many interesting quantum statistical eﬀects due

to its nonlinear coupling nature in the dynamics [6]. On the other hand, the pure atomic condensates in

a double-well potential also attracted considerable interest since many intriguing quantum phenomena

really can appear in this system [7], hence a natural question arises about the possible new properties

of a hybrid atom-molecule condensate in a double-well potential, by adding an additional associating

light. This problem is also related to that of molecular formations via PA in an optical lattice [8].

In fact, our previous work in three-mode case already showed that [9], the coherent PA process in

a double-well potential really leads to some novel quantum statistical phenomena, e.g., the squeezing-

free eﬀect for molecules in the initial vacuum-state well via PA of tunnelling atoms from another

site. In this paper, we present an eﬀective mean ﬁeld approach (MFA) to study the average molecular

populations in two wells by numerically solving the general depleted case beyond short-time limits.

We ﬁnd that, just for valid MFA parameters range, the new freedoms of atomic tunnelling and then

the formed molecules can strongly inﬂuence the molecular occupations, meanwhile the associating

light strength also can play a notable diﬀerent role. In particular, the novel eﬀect of strong decaying

molecular oscillations (without or with molecular tunnelling in the deep- or shallow-well case) can

be revealed by adjusting these two parameters. A simple physical picture for this eﬀect is given

by comparing with the well-known two-color free-bound-bound PA case [10], which clearly shows a

promising way to create a stable molecular condensate via coherent ”double-well PA” technique.

FIG. 1: A sketch of the coherent photo-association (PA) process in a magnetic double-well potential. Initially,
the atomic component A is entirely trapped in the right site, the coherent PA only happens in the left site.

Turning to the situation of Fig. 1, we assume for simplicity that large number of Bose-condensed

atoms are loaded into, say, the right side of a double-well magnetic potential, and then the Josephson

tunnelling of particles may generate condensate in left well which is initially vacuum. The coherent PA

process occurring only within left well may coherently convert the tunelling atoms into the molecules.

The dynamics of double-well atomic condensates can be described by a simple model [7] which includes

the Kerr-type atomic interactions occupying the same or diﬀerent wells. However, the atomic collisions

eﬀects on the dynamics of double-well condensates are well-known [7, 11] and its strength can be tuned

by the technique of magnetic-ﬁeld-induced Feshbach resonance [12], hence, to see clearly the results

of nonlinear PA interactions in presence of particles tunnelling, we naturally ignore it for present

purpose (the strengths for the molecules or atom-molecule collisions are yet not known [5]). In the

second quantized notation, boson annihilation operators for trapped atoms and molecules in two

wells are denoted by a1, a2, b1 and b2, respectively. The free part of the total Hamiltonian are

written as H0 =

1b1, where ∆ and δ are the magnetic and optical detunings respectively,

and generally, one should also consider the possible eﬀects of these detunings [5], but here we focus

attention on the most interested eﬀects in this system due to the interactions of diﬀerent modes (i.e.,

the resonance case). Deﬁning the magnetic and optical (Rabi) coupling frequencies as ga, gb and γ,
the four-mode Hamiltonian can be written as H = H0 + Hint, where the interaction part is (~ = 1)

and Ga (Gb) is the atomic (molecular) tunnelling term, and γ represents an eﬀective Rabi frequency

characterizing the coherent PA process applied for an arbitrary time interval. For simplicity, we

have ignored the incoherent process of the excited-state molecular damping or the eﬀect of molecular

dissociating into those non-condensate atomic modes [13].

In practice, to avoid possible heating

eﬀects in PA process, the condition γ
ω should be satisﬁed by properly choosing the trap frequency
ω = √4V0ER with V0 the potential depth and ER the atomic recoil energy. Obviously a conserved

Note that the main feature of our present scheme is that the coherent PA process starts not directly

in the initial trapped atomic condensate, but in the ”developing” atomic mode which is initially in a

vacuum state. The Heisenberg equations of motion for the atomic and molecular modes read

˙a1 = iGaa2 + 2iγa†

where αi and βi (i = 1, 2) are two complex numbers. Such replacement is the so-called semiclassical

approach analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii approximation used to describe an alkali condensate [3, 4].

It is completely accessible to also incorporate the molecular damping terms ξβi phenomenologically

into the molecular-mode equations for our numerical study (ξ is proportional to the molecular damping

rate), but we would not consider it here for two physical reasons: ﬁrstly we mainly focus on the role

of coherent PA process in the double-well situation and, comparing with the well-known single-well

PA case, these additional damping terms fail to bring any qualitatively new results for the evolutions

of average molecular occupations in our model; secondly, some techniques can be used to minimize

the eﬀects of these quasi-bound molecular damping terms, such as the Feshbach-resonance-assisted
stimulated adiabatic passage (STIRAP) method, proposed by Ling et al. through the MFA [14].

We remark that the MFA in our model should have a limited range of validity. In particular, it

certainly should break down and be replaced by a fully quantized theory when the eﬀects of quantum

f luctuations become important. For example, by directly starting from Eq. (2), we have analyzed

the quantum dynamics and statistics in the short-time and undepleted limits (without molecular

tunnelling) [9]. Of course, the precise criteria for the validity of MFA in our model will be known

only when the generalization to the more interested long-time depleted case is available. Nevertheless,

one would expect that its range of validity should include a certain variety of phenomena of interest,

especially when the concerned problem is the average molecule numbers under certain parameters [6].

Interestingly, we will see that some nontrivial results really can be revealed in the present model.

To see concrete examples, we have analyzed the diﬀerent dynamical behaviors for the molecule

numbers in two wells under the conditions of deep- and shallow- well cases, respectively, and compared

these behaviors with that of single-well case, which indicates a quite diﬀerent but interesting way to

create a stable molecular condensate by using this double-well potential.

(i) Deep double-well case.

The results about the dynamical evolutions of molecular numbers can

be shown as Fig. 2 by numerically solving Eq. (3). Clearly, if one only consider the atomic tunnelling,

the PA leads to an increasing of molecule number in left site, as it should be. However, comparing

with the single-well case (see the later), the molecular formation which happens in an initial vacuum

FIG. 2: (Color online) The molecular populations in a deep double-well case: (a),(b) without molecular
tunnelling; (c),(d) with molecular tunnelling. The initial atoms number is typically 5000 [5]. The couplings
strength (in units MHz) and temporal length can be limited within validity range of mean ﬁeld approach [6].

FIG. 3: (Color online) The molecular populations in a shallow double-well case with (a),(b) weak or (c),(d)
strong molecular tunnelling. Stronger couplings are not considered (with reducing valid evolution time [6]).

instead of a trapped condensate will not need a strong PA light. More interestingly, when we take

the molecular tunnelling into account, similar phenomena like that of two-color PA with ”molecular

tunnelling” term [10] can be observed, i.e., almost all the formed molecules accumulate in right

site, meanwhile the strong PA light leads to decaying molecular oscillations with time. A simple

physical picture can also be similarly given for this [14]: the interf erence of two possible evolution

channels for the left-site molecular mode (i.e., the left-site atomic mode and the right-site molecular

mode) under certain parameters leads to its eﬀectively zero occupation and then the accumulations of

photoassociated molecules in a diﬀerent site. Note that, for ensuring the validity range of MFA, the

couplings strength and the temporal length should be carefully reduced within certain values [6, 14].

(ii) Shallow double-well case.

The evolutions of the molecular numbers are shown in Fig. 3, which

clearly shows the diﬀerent roles of atomic and molecular tunnellings in coherent molecular formations.

For much stronger atomic tunnelling and strong PA light, we ﬁnd strong decaying molecular oscillations

which, together with other useful techniques [5, 10, 14], may provide a promising way to obtain more

stable molecular condensate via a double-well potential. Note that, this results are based on our

mean-ﬁeld zero-dimensional model under the approximation of density homogeneity within two wells,

although it can be possible to estimate the inhomogeneity eﬀect in the Thomas-Fermi limit [14].

FIG. 4: (Color online) The populations of atoms Na(= |α|)2 and molecules Nb(= |β|2) in a single well, for
(a),(b) the short-time or (c),(d) the long-time case (for the comparison with the double-well PA case).

(iii) Single-well case.

For a clear comparison, we also plot the short- and long-time behaviors of

molecule numbers evolutions for single well case as in Fig. 4(a)-(b), respectively. The only control

−

parameter now is the PA light strength. Obviously, although stronger PA light induces rapid molecules

increasing, it also leads to rapid molecular oscillations for long evolution time, which should be avoided

in any actual experiment. Thereby the considerable decaying of molecular oscillations in our scheme,

especially for long evolution time, obtained by controlling particle tunnellings and PA light strength,

may shed some new light on current experimental eﬀorts towards a stable molecular condensate.

We should emphasis again that, in our mean-ﬁeld zero-dimensional model, the only used approx-

imation is the atomic density homogeneity within two wells. Although we have ignored the atomic

collisions and the molecular damping as explained above, these terms would be simple to include in

the model especially in the high coupling limits where their eﬀects on the spatial structure can be

much reduced. Also it would be interesting to adopt the MFA beyond zero-dimensional model [5, 15].

Summing up, we have numerically examined an interesting scheme for creating a molecular conden-

sate via coherent PA of the Josephson tunnelling atoms in a double-well potential, focusing on the

average molecular numbers in two wells. Starting from a mean-ﬁeld four-mode model, we analyzed

the diﬀerent roles of atomic and molecular tunnellings and that of PA light strength in the molecular

formations. An interesting strong-decaying eﬀect was observed for the right-site molecular oscillations

6

in the case of strong atomic tunnelling and strong PA light strength (with PA process only happening

in the left site). This is diﬀerent from the single well case and may provide a promising way for

creating a stable molecular condensate via PA process in a double-well potential. Our scheme can be

viewed as further generalization of two-color PA (only with ”molecular tunnelling” [10, 14]).

Of course, even more important phenomena due to quantum ﬂuctuations of matter-wave ﬁelds,

like the quantum statistics of the resulting ﬁelds, can be investigated only by methods beyond any

mean-ﬁeld approach. A powerful numerical technique based on the c-number stochastic equations in

the positive-P representation of quantum optics [16] may be used to study these intriguing subjects

as in the extensive studies of two-color PA process [5, 15], which may comprise the future works.

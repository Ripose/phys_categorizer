Abstract
A theoretical description of the dissociative recombination process for the HCO+ ion suggests

that the Renner-Teller coupling between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom plays a vital

role. This ﬁnding is consistent with a recent study of this process for another closed-shell molecule,
the H+

3 ion, where Jahn-Teller coupling was shown to generate a relatively high rate. The cross
section obtained here for the dissociative recombination of HCO+ exhibits encouraging agreement

with a merged-beam experiment.

The dissociative recombination (DR) of small molecular ions that collide with electrons

plays an important role in interstellar diﬀuse and dense clouds. It is well known that these

clouds constitute building material for new stars. The importance of DR cross sections as
parameters in star formation models, for such astrophysically relevant ions as H+
3 and HCO+,

is one of the reasons why DR has been extensively studied in laboratory experiments [1].

For diatomic molecules the process is well understood and described theoretically [2]. Until

recently [3, 4, 5, 6] though, theory was unable to model the DR process in triatomic ions,

except in cases where a neutral dissociative state crossed the ionic Born-Oppenheimer surface

in the Franck-Condon region, generating a rapid rate [3]. In triatomics, a key complication

is the fact that multiple vibrational (3) and rotational (3) degrees of freedom must generally

be taken into account. And in addition to the greater computational burden of treating

more dimensions quantum mechanically, the addition of these new degrees of freedom can

also lead to new conceptual issues, related to the degeneracy of vibrational or rovibrational
levels in certain triatomic ions (e.g., in both H+
3 and HCO+). This can cause an intrinsic

instability of the corresponding neutral molecules [7] that causes them to distort away from

the symmetric geometry.

Consider an incident electron that interacts with a closed-shell triatomic ion having a

degenerate vibrational mode. If the symmetry group Γ of the resulting neutral complex has

at least one degenerate irreducible representation, the electronic partial wave components

with angular momentum l > 0 typically contain at least one such representation, whereby

the corresponding electronic states of the neutral molecule are degenerate in the clamped-

nuclei approximation. Due to the Jahn-Teller theorem [7, 8, 9], ﬁrst formulated by Landau

[7, 10], this degenerate electronic state strongly interacts with a degenerate vibrational state

of the Γ group. The interaction leads to either a quadratic (Renner-Teller) [11] or linear

conical (Jahn-Teller) intersection, depending on whether the molecule is linear or not. In

electron-induced reactions, electron capture can be followed by dissociation or autoioniza-

tion of the recombined system. Since the degenerate electronic state causes the instability

of the symmetric conﬁguration, the recombined molecule quickly distorts away from the

symmetry point to remove the degeneracy, after which the autoionization channel typically

becomes energetically closed, and the molecule eventually ﬁnds a pathway along which it

can dissociate. In a system for which no direct crossing of a neutral dissociative state with

the ground state of the ion is present, this mechanism can become dominant, and it can

2

still produce large DR cross sections. This is expected to be particularly true for molecules

containing hydrogen.

Two of us recently have found that this is what happens in H+

3 + e− collisions [6]. For
HCO+, a closed-shell linear ion in its ground state, the picture is rather similar. The lowest

doubly-degenerate vibrational E states are coupled to the electronic states E1(npπ) of the

neutral system through the Renner-Teller interaction, resulting in a large probability for

recombination.

The aim of the present study is to understand the mechanism of DR in HCO+, and in

particular to interpret its large measured rate. This ion was ﬁrst detected in space and then
synthesized in the laboratory [12]. Experimental measurements of DR in HCO+ were realized

in a number of merged-beam, afterglow-plasma, and storage ring experiments [13, 14]. In
[15] we have presented the potential energy surfaces for the ground state of HCO+

Ref.

and the lowest states of HCO, calculated as a function of all three vibrational coordinates.

The potentials were then used to estimate the DR rate. Since the splitting between the two

E1(npπ) electronic states for the principal quantum number n = 3 was found to be small,

it was suggested that the Renner-Teller non-Born-Oppenheimer coupling should not play
a signiﬁcant role in DR of HCO+, therefore it was not included in the model of Ref.

[15].

However, since even a small coupling between degenerate states may in principle result in

large DR probability, we decided to investigate the role of the Renner-Teller coupling in

HCO in more detail.

The starting point of the present theoretical approach is the molecular Hamiltonian H of

HCO, which we represent as H = Hion + Hint , where Hion is the ionic Hamiltonian and Hint

describes the electron-ion interactions. We assume that the ion is in its ground electronic

state. Hion and Hint depend on the four internuclear coordinates

}
where RCH and RCO are the C-H and C-O internuclear distances, θ is the bending angle,

RCH, RCO, θ, ϕ

Q

=

{

,

which is zero for linear conﬁgurations. The angle ϕ represents the azimuthal orientation of

the bending. The electronic energies do not depend on it.

We assume that the incident electron is initially captured in one of the ionic Rydberg

states, which can be approximately characterized by the principal quantum number n, the

orbital angular momentum l, and its projection on the molecular axis λ. In our model we
have included only the npπ−1,npπ+1, npσ, nsσ and ndσ states. The symbols

1 imply two

±

opposite-sense rotations associated with the diﬀerent signs of λ. Linear combinations of

3

the nπ±1 states give states npπ+ and npπ−, symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to

reﬂection in the plane containing the molecular axis. The other three states are symmetric.

These states were established in Ref.

[15] to be the most important for DR, since they

have the largest dependence on the vibrational coordinates. Therefore, Hint has a block-

diagonal form with inﬁnite number of 5

5 blocks corresponding to n = 2, 3,

,

, plus the

×

continuum. Since the only oﬀ-diagonal couplings included in our analysis are those among

the three np states, for simplicity we specify only these states in the formulas below.

The np-block of Hint in the basis of the npπ+1, npσ and npπ−1 states has the form [16]

denote both the nπ

as a function of the bending angle θ for ﬁxed RCH = 2.0 a.u. and RCO = 2.0877 a.u. Labeling the

states with electronic momentum projection λ is an approximation and for large values of θ it is

not appropriate. However, the four sσ, pσ, dσ, and pπ+ are always uncoupled from pπ− states for

nonlinear geometries. Without coupling between the pπ+ and pσ states, the pπ+ and pπ− states

would have the same defects, therefore the Renner-Teller parameters can be calculated from their

splitting.

Similarly to our previous DR studies [4, 5, 6], we employ multi-channel quantum defect

theory and need to construct the reaction matrix K, related to the potential as in Ref. [17].

Once the reaction matrix Ki,i′ is obtained, the DR treatment is along the lines of Refs.

[4, 18] with the following diﬀerences. We use here the RCH distance as dissociative adi-

abatic coordinate. This choice is justiﬁed because experimentally the H+CO channel is

6

largely dominant. We keep the RCO distance constant at its ionic equilibrium value. This

simpliﬁcation was made because according to our model of Eq. 1, only nuclear motion along
RCH, θ and ϕ can generate a high probability for HCO+ to capture the electron. In addi-

tion, the previous theoretical DR study [15] has demonstrated that taking into account the

vibration over RCO does not increase the DR cross section signiﬁcantly. Consequently, for

every RCH distance we calculate matrix elements of the ”large” reaction matrix

The matrix

in Ref. [4]. The curves in general have non-zero autoionization widths Γa(RCH), which in

turn are used to calculate the DR cross section as described in Refs.

[4, 18]. We assume

study shows that the DR rate strongly depends on the vibrational population. To compare

with the experimental data, we have to average the cross section over the vibrational state

distribution, which is not available for the experiment by Le Padellec et al.

[13].

It is

reasonable to guess that the vibrational temperature in that experiment is 1000 K. For

such temperature the averaged calculated cross section will be about a factor 1.5-2.5 smaller

be also explained by diﬀerent initial vibrational populations. Determination of the actual
experimental vibrational distribution and/or its control in HCO+ could be an important

step in understanding DR in small polyatomic ions. We have also calculated the thermal

DR rate α(kT ) according to Eq. (7) of Ref. [4]. The resulting theoretical rates are shown

in Fig. (4) and compared to experiment.

We should mention some approximations made in the present study that can aﬀect the

obtained DR cross section. First, the treatment does not account for the possible autoion-

ization after the electron is captured by the ion, but before the neutral molecule dissociates.

The inclusion of this process might decrease the calculated DR cross section. However, a
previous H+

3 estimation has shown that this eﬀect is negligible due to the fast transition of

the ion-electron system to the low-lying states that are energetically closed to ionization.

The second approximation is our neglect of the C-O vibrational motion. Its inclusion can

probably only increase the likelihood of capturing the electron and, therefore, the DR cross

section. Also, the n = 2 Rydberg states have a dissociative character and they are not well

described by this model. However, we believe that the main contribution to the probability

is due to the Renner-Teller coupling between motion of the electron and the molecular ion

along the θ and ϕ coordinate. In conclusion, we have shown that even a modest Renner-

Teller splitting can cause a greatly enhanced DR rate, bringing the theoretical results close

to experiment.

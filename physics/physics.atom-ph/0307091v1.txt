Abstract. – We demonstrate a technique for frequency measurements of UV transitions with
sub-MHz precision. The frequency is measured using a ring-cavity resonator whose length
is calibrated against a reference laser locked to the D2 line of 87Rb. We have used this to
measure the 398.8 nm 1S0 ↔ 1P 1 line of atomic Yb. We report isotope shifts of all the
seven stable isotopes, including the rarest isotope 168Yb. We have been able to resolve the
overlapping 173Yb(F = 3/2) and 172Yb transitions for the ﬁrst time. We also obtain high-
precision measurements of excited-state hyperﬁne structure in the odd isotopes, 171Yb and
173Yb. The measurements resolve several discrepancies among earlier measurements.

Precise measurements of the frequencies of atomic transitions are an important tool in
expanding our knowledge of physics. For example, precise measurement of the D1 line in Cs
[1] combined with an atom-interferometric measurement of the photon recoil shift [2] could
lead to a more accurate determination of the ﬁne-structure constant α. In addition, hyperﬁne-
structure and isotope-shift measurements in atomic lines can help in ﬁne-tuning the atomic
wavefunction, particularly due to contributions from nuclear interactions. This is important
when comparing theoretical calculations with experimental data in atomic studies of parity
violation [3]. The most precise optical frequency measurements to date have been done using
the recently developed frequency-comb method with mode-locked lasers [1], with errors below
100 kHz being reported. However, to the best of our knowledge, this technique has not yet
been applied to UV spectroscopy, which relies on older and less-accurate techniques.

In this Letter, we present the most comprehensive study of the 398.8 nm 1S0 ↔ 1P 1 line
of atomic Yb. Yb (Z=70) is an attractive candidate for studying atomic parity violation [4]
and the search for a permanent electric-dipole moment in atoms [5]. Laser-cooled Yb has also
been proposed for frequency-standards applications [6]. The 1S0 ↔ 1P 1 line is widely used
in laser-cooling experiments [5, 7]. Over the years, there has been much interest in this line,
and its isotopic and hyperﬁne components have been measured using a variety of techniques
– level-crossing and anti-crossing spectroscopy [8, 9, 10], Fabry-Perot cavity [11], saturated-
absorption spectroscopy [12], photon-burst spectroscopy [13], and most recently using optical

double-resonance spectroscopy with cold atoms in a magneto-optic trap [7]. However, all
these measurements have errors of several MHz and show wide discrepancies with each other.
We report the ﬁrst sub-MHz measurement of the isotope shifts of all seven stable isotopes,
including the rarest isotope 168Yb (natural abundance = 0.13%). We have been able to resolve
the overlapping 173Yb(F = 3/2) and 172Yb transitions for the ﬁrst time. We also report high-
precision measurements of excited-state hyperﬁne structure in the odd isotopes, 171Yb and
173Yb.

Our novel technique for the frequency measurement uses the fact that the absolute fre-
quency of the D2 line (5S1/2 ↔ 5P3/2 transition) in 87Rb has been measured with an accuracy
of 10 kHz [14]. A stabilized diode laser locked to this line is used as a frequency reference
along with a ring-cavity resonator whose length is locked to the reference laser. For a given
cavity length, an unknown laser on an atomic transition has a small frequency oﬀset from
the nearest cavity resonance. This oﬀset is combined with the cavity mode number to obtain
a precise value for the absolute frequency of the unknown laser. We have earlier used this
technique to make measurements of hyperﬁne intervals in the D2 line of 85Rb with 30 kHz
precision [15], where we have also highlighted the advantages of the Rb-stabilized ring cavity.
In this work, we apply the technique for UV measurements using a frequency-doubled IR laser
to access the UV lines. By measuring the frequency of the IR laser and not the UV laser,
we avoid several complications associated with UV spectroscopy. The technique is uniquely
suited for measuring hyperﬁne intervals and isotope shifts since several sources of systematic
error cancel in such measurements.

The schematic of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1. Laser1 is a frequency-stabilized diode
laser that acts as the frequency reference for the cavity. It is locked to the D2 line of 87Rb
using saturated-absorption spectroscopy in a vapor cell. Laser2 is a tunable Ti-sapphire laser
(Coherent 899-21) whose output is fed into an external frequency doubler (Laser Analytical
Systems LAS100) to access the 398.8 nm Yb line. The doubler uses a patented ∆-cavity
design that allows it to track large frequency scans of the Ti-S laser (up to 30 GHz) without
mode hops. The Ti-S laser is frequency stabilized to a linewidth of 500 kHz. A part of its
output is tapped oﬀ before the doubler and coupled into the ring-cavity resonator for the
frequency measurement. Yb spectroscopy is done inside a vacuum chamber maintained at a
pressure below 10−9 torr. The Yb atomic beam is produced by heating a quartz ampoule
containing metallic Yb to a temperature of 400◦C. To reduce Doppler broadening, the laser
beam intersects the atomic beam at right angles and the ﬂuorescence from the atoms is

Fig. 2 – Determination of the frequency oﬀset. The lower trace is the ﬂuorescence signal as the laser
is scanned across the 174Yb transition. The upper traces are the cavity-reﬂection signal for two values
of the AOM frequency: 110.46 MHz for the solid line and 114.96 MHz for the dotted line. A ﬁt to
the separation between the ﬂuorescence and cavity peaks vs. the AOM frequency yields the exact
frequency that brings the cavity on resonance, which in this case is 112.64 MHz.

Fig. 3 – Three-peak ﬁtting to extract overlapping transitions. The ﬂuorescence signal (shown as
gray circles) is ﬁtted to three Lorentzians with the same linewidths. The three peaks correspond to
173Yb(F = 3/2) labeled as a, 172Yb labeled as b, and 173Yb(F = 7/2) labeled as c. The thick line

residuals shown on top.

detected through a narrow slit. A typical Yb spectrum is shown in Fig. 1b. With 20 mW of
UV light in a beam of diameter 1 cm, we achieve a linewidth of 45 MHz, or about 50% larger
than the natural linewidth of 28 MHz.

The frequency measurement proceeds as follows. The outputs of Laser1 (reference) and
Laser2 (Ti-S) are fed into the ring cavity. The cavity length is adjusted using a piezo-mounted
mirror to bring it into resonance with the wavelength of Laser1. The cavity is then locked to
this length in a feedback loop. However, Laser2 will still be oﬀset from the cavity resonance.
This oﬀset is accounted for by shifting the frequency of the laser using an acousto-optic
modulator (AOM) before it enters the cavity. The signal from a scan of Laser2 is shown in
Fig. 2. The upper trace shows the reﬂected signal from the cavity, which goes to a minimum
as the cavity comes into resonance. The lower trace is the ﬂuorescence signal corresponding
to the 174Yb transition. The cavity resonance slightly to the left of the 174Yb peak (solid
line) is for an AOM frequency of 110.46 MHz, while the one to the right (dotted line) is for
a frequency of 114.96 MHz. Thus, by changing the AOM frequency, we can move the cavity
resonance across the 174Yb peak. The peak centers are determined to an accuracy of 50 kHz
by ﬁtting a Lorentzian lineshape, and we verify that there is no signiﬁcant deviation from
this lineshape from the featureless residuals. A straight-line ﬁt to the peak separation vs.
the AOM frequency gives the AOM frequency that brings the cavity into resonance (with a
typical accuracy of 100 kHz). Once the exact cavity length (or mode number) is known, the
absolute frequency of Laser1 is used to determine the absolute frequency of Laser2.

The measurements rely on the fact that the cavity mode number is known exactly. For
this, we measure the cavity free-spectral range (fsr) very precisely, in the following manner.

EUROPHYSICS LETTERS

We ﬁrst lock the cavity with the reference laser on the F = 2 → F ′ = (2, 3) transition in
87Rb and measure the AOM oﬀset for the 174Yb transition. We then shift the reference laser
to the F = 1 → F ′ = (1, 2) transition, which is exactly 6622.887 MHz higher [16, 14]. This
shift causes the cavity mode number to increase by almost exactly 5 since the fsr is about
1326 MHz. The cavity is locked to the new frequency and the AOM oﬀset for the same 174Yb
transition is measured. The diﬀerence between the two AOM oﬀsets along with the change in
the reference frequency gives exactly 5 times the cavity fsr. Using this method, we determine
the fsr with a precision of 30 kHz. To determine the mode number, we measure the frequency
of the 174Yb transition to an accuracy of 20 MHz using a home-built wavemeter [17]. Thus,
there is a unique mode-number that matches the cavity resonance condition and the measured
fsr. Indeed, the next nearest mode that satisﬁes the resonance condition has an fsr diﬀering
by 625 kHz, or about 20 times the error in the determination of the fsr. Similarly, a change in
the mode number by one causes the frequency of the 174Yb transition to change by 60 MHz,
or about 3 times the error with which the frequency is known.

The Yb spectrum has two peaks where there is signiﬁcant overlap between neighboring
transitions. One of these consists of the 171Yb(F = 1/2) and the 170Yb transitions. This
does not present any problem in our technique because the two transitions are separated by
about 40 MHz and the spectrum shows two clear maxima. A two-Lorentzian ﬁtting algorithm
uniquely extracts the locations of the two transitions. However, the other multiple peak
consists of the 173Yb(F = 3/2), 172Yb, and 173Yb(F = 7/2) transitions, all lying within 50
MHz of each other. As seen from Fig. 3, the ﬁrst two transitions have a separation less than
the natural linewidth and are completely merged. When we ﬁt a single Lorentzian to these two
overlapping transitions, we ﬁnd its linewidth to be 1.4 times larger than the linewidth of the
neighboring 173Yb(F = 7/2) transition, and indeed the linewidth of all the other peaks in the
spectrum. This gives us conﬁdence that the increased linewidth is a result of the convolution
of two individual Lorentzians. Therefore, we ﬁt two Lorentzians to the overlapping peaks,
and a third Lorentzian to the neighboring peak, with the constraint that the linewidth of all
three peaks is the same. The algorithm then returns three peaks having linewidths similar
to what we obtain for other well-resolved peaks. As seen from Fig. 3, the ﬁt residuals are
very small and their structure-less noise shows that there is no ambiguity in the ﬁtting. After
ﬁtting to about 30 spectra we obtain an average value of 17.64 ± 0.90 MHz for the separation
between the 173Yb(F = 3/2) and the 172Yb line centers. We believe this is the ﬁrst direct
measurement of this separation.

The ﬁrst source of systematic error we consider arises due to improper perpendicular
alignment of the laser beam with the Yb atomic beam. A misalignment angle of 10 mrad can
cause a Doppler shift of about 7 MHz. To minimize this, we have repeated each measurement
with a counter-propagating laser beam. Since the shift in this case is of opposite sign, the
error cancels when we take an average of the two values. Indeed, the diﬀerence between the
two values gives an estimate of the misalignment angle, which in our case is less than 2 mrad.
In any case, the error cancels in the determination of the isotope shifts (relative to 174Yb)
since all isotopes experience the same shift. Of course, there is a small diﬀerential Doppler
shift due to the fact that the diﬀerent isotopes leave the oven with slightly diﬀerent velocities.
But even for a large misalignment angle of 10 mrad the diﬀerential shift is only 120 kHz,
which is negligible at our level of precision.

There are two classes of systematic error inherent to our technique. The ﬁrst depends
on variations of the reference laser. The possible causes are shifts in the laser lock point
due to residual Doppler proﬁle or optical-pumping eﬀects in the Rb saturated-absorption
spectrometer which change the lineshape of the peaks. We have tried to minimize this by using
third-harmonic locking and careful control of pump and probe intensities in the spectrometer.

Collisional shifts in the Rb vapor cell are estimated to be less than 10 kHz. The magnetic
ﬁeld in the vicinity of the cell is less than 0.1 mT. Such magnetic ﬁelds cause broadening
of the lines but do not shift the line center. As a further check on these errors, we have
repeated the experiments with the vapor cell at diﬀerent locations, and using vapor cells from
diﬀerent manufacturers. In our earlier work [15], we have shown that systematic shifts in the
reference frequency are below 30 kHz. Finally, we have measured the same Yb transition using
diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions to lock the reference laser. The reference frequency changes by
known amounts (up to several GHz), and we have veriﬁed that the measured frequencies are
consistent within the error bars. Changing the lock point of the reference laser also changes
the cavity mode and the AOM oﬀset needed to bring the Yb transition into resonance with
the cavity. This checks for systematic errors that might arise from variations in the direction
of the beam entering the cavity when the AOM frequency is varied.

The second class of systematic errors in our technique is wavelength dependent. Since our
cavity is comparing the wavelengths of the two lasers, we have to convert these to frequencies
using the refractive index of air [18]. Any error in the refractive index would reﬂect as a sys-
tematic shift in the measured frequency. From the reliability of the refractive index formulae,
we estimate that this could cause a shift as large as 3 MHz in the measured frequencies. The
only way to reduce this is to use an evacuated cavity, which we plan to do in the future.
Wavelength-dependent systematic errors can also arise from varying phase shifts in the cavity
mirrors, but we expect these to be negligible at the MHz level. It is important to note that
both classes of systematic errors do not aﬀect the determination of frequency diﬀerences of
the unknown laser, up to several 10s of GHz. For example, in the measurement of the Yb
line, these errors would cause all the frequencies to shift, but the diﬀerences listed in Table I
will not change down to the kHz level.

The measured frequencies of the various transitions in the 1S0 ↔ 1P 1 line of Yb are listed
in Table I. Each value is an average of 6 individual measurements and the error quoted is
the statistical error in the average. Even though we measure the absolute frequency of each
transition, we have listed the values as shifts from the frequency of the 174Yb transition. This
is because, as mentioned earlier, the measured frequencies may have large systematic errors
due to the uncertainty in the refractive index, but the frequency diﬀerences have negligible
error. Furthermore, this way of presenting the data allows direct comparison with previous
work where only the shifts were measured. It is clear from the several blank entries for the

previous work that our work is the most comprehensive measurement of this line to date. In
addition, some of the previous results have non-overlapping error bars to the extent of 10σ
and our work resolves these discrepancies. For 176Yb, it is now accepted that the low value
obtained by Chaiko [19] is incorrect. For 171Yb(F = 1/2), our value is in agreement with the
recent value of 1151.4 MHz reported by Loftus et al. [7] but inconsistent with the value of
1136.2 MHz reported by Deilamian et al. [13]. Indeed, the main result in the work of Deilamian
et al. is to resolve the overlapping 171Yb(F = 1/2) and 170Yb transitions. The separation
they measure is 36.3 ± 2.5 MHz, which is in good agreement with our value of 39.5 ± 0.4 MHz.
For 170Yb, the most discrepant value is the result of Chaiko, where we have already seen that
the value for 176Yb is incorrect. The most recent result for 170Yb is consistent only at the 2σ
level, suggesting the need for further high-precision measurements to verify our results. All
the other shifts reported by us agree with previous work.

We have used the data in Table I to obtain the hyperﬁne-coupling constants in the
6s6p 1P 1 state of the odd isotopes, 171Yb and 173Yb. For 171Yb, the measured {3/2 − 1/2}
interval is used to calculate the magnetic-dipole coupling constant A, yielding a value of
A171 = −213.08(47) MHz. This value is compared with earlier values in Fig. 4. Our value
is consistent but has signiﬁcantly smaller error. For 173Yb, there are three hyperﬁne levels
and the measured intervals are used to calculate the magnetic-dipole coupling constant A and
the electric-quadrupole coupling constant B. We obtain values of A173 = 57.91(12) MHz and
B173 = 610.47(84) MHz. These values are again compared to earlier results in Figs. 5a and b,
respectively. While our value of A173 is consistent, the value of B173 is higher than the most
recent value reported by Liening [10] from a level-crossing experiment. However, our value is
in agreement with the other values. In addition, we have calculated the value of gJ from the

Ayan Banerjee et al.: Precise measurements of UV atomic lines

7

value of A171/gJ = 206.0(16) reported by Budick and Snir [8] using a level-crossing experi-
ment. We obtain a value of gJ = 1.034(7), which is consistent with the currently accepted
value of 1.035(5) [11], giving further conﬁdence in our results.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a novel technique for measuring the frequencies of
UV transitions using a Rb-stabilized ring-cavity resonator. The UV lines are accessed using
a frequency-doubled IR laser. By measuring the frequency of the IR laser instead of the UV
laser, we simplify the measurement process and avoid several sources of systematic errors.
We have used this technique to measure various transitions in the 398.8 nm line in Yb. We
obtain sub-MHz accuracy in the determination of isotope shifts for all isotopes (including the
rarest isotope 168Yb), representing an order of magnitude or more improvement in precision.
We have also determined hyperﬁne structure for the odd isotopes with high precision. Our
technique actually gives the absolute frequencies of the diﬀerent transitions. However, we have
quoted only the shifts from the 174Yb transition since uncertainties in the refractive index of
air in the cavity can cause an error as large as 3 MHz. In future, we plan to evacuate the
cavity which will eliminate the need for refractive index correction. In addition, we plan to use
a frequency-doubled diode laser for the UV spectroscopy. The output of the diode laser can be
easily frequency modulated by modulating the injection current. The error signal generated
can be fed back to lock the AOM frequency to a given peak, which will give us much higher
accuracy in the frequency measurement. Using such a current-modulated diode laser, we have
already demonstrated a precision of 30 kHz in measuring the 780 nm D2 line of 85Rb [15],
and we hope to achieve similar precision in the measurement of UV lines.

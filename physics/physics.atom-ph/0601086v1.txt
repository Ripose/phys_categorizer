Based on an experimental study of two-body and three-body collisions in ultracold strontium
samples, a novel optical-sympathetic cooling method in isotopic mixtures is demonstrated. Without
evaporative cooling, a phase-space density of 6 × 10−2 is obtained with a high spatial density that
should allow to overcome the diﬃculties encountered so far to reach quantum degeneracy for Sr
atoms.

PACS numbers: 32.80.Pj, 34.50.-s, 05.30.Jp, 32.80.-t.

The combination of laser cooling [1] and evaporative
cooling allowed to reach ultra-low temperatures and to
observe Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and Fermi de-
generacy for diﬀerent atoms [2]. Laser cooling is indeed
very eﬀective to reach phase-space densities within few
orders of magnitude of quantum degeneracy. The limits
in cooling at high density are set by the optical depth of
the sample, i.e. reabsorption of scattered light, and light-
assisted atom-atom collisions. Forced evaporative cool-
ing [3] represents the common way to circumvent these
limits. However, this procedure does not work for all
atoms. In particular, among the atoms cooled with opti-
cal methods, none of the alkali-earth atoms reached quan-
tum degeneracy so far, except ytterbium which has an
alkali-earth-like electronic structure [4]. A phase-space
density of ∼ 10−1 was reported for Sr [5] but BEC could
not be reached. Sr is of interest for several reasons: In a
natural strontium sample, diﬀerent isotopes can be inves-
tigated with diﬀerent statistics; 88Sr (82.6 %), 86Sr (9.8
%), and 84Sr (0.6 %) are bosons with zero nuclear spin;
87Sr (7%) is a fermion with nuclear spin I = 9/2. A BEC
of Sr atoms would allow the study of 0-spin condensates,
fast optical cooling and continuous coherent matter-wave
sources, quantum devices both for frequency standards
and inertial sensors. Besides the studies towards quan-
tum degeneracy, Sr has recently been the subject of ac-
tive research in various ﬁelds spanning from laser cooling
physics [6, 7], investigation of ultra-narrow transitions
towards future optical clocks [8, 9, 10, 11], multiple scat-
tering [12], and collisional physics [13] [14] [15] [16] [17].

In this article, we present a novel scheme for the pro-
duction of a high phase-space density sample of atomic
strontium. Since collisional processes play a crucial role
and relevant parameters are not well known for this atom,
we studied 2-body and 3-body collisions both in pure
samples, and isotopic mixtures. Our results show that
usual evaporative cooling methods are diﬃcult to ap-
ply in a single species sample of 86Sr or 88Sr. The in-
vestigation of an ultracold 86Sr-88Sr mixture revealed a

large interspecies elastic cross-section; this allowed us to
demonstrate an optical-sympathetic cooling method con-
ceptually diﬀerent from what was done so far on neutral
atoms [18, 19] and somehow analogous to the one used
for trapped ions [20], achieving a phase-space density of
6×10−2 in conditions suitable to further cooling of the
sample towards BEC.

The experimental setup, based on the apparatus pre-
viously described in [8, 21], allows to trap single-isotope
samples or isotopic mixtures of 86Sr and 88Sr atoms in
an optical dipole trap. The loading procedure starts with
a magneto-optical trap on the 1S0-1P1 resonance transi-
tion at 461 nm. During this phase, a decay channel from
the excited state results in the accumulation of atoms
in the magnetically trapped metastable 3P2 state [22].
The isotopic mixture is produced in the magnetic trap
by stepping the frequency of the trapping laser to the ap-
propriate values. After loading the magnetic trap, atoms
are optically pumped back into the electronic ground
state and a second cooling stage is applied based on a
magneto-optical trap operating on the narrow 1S0-3P1
transition at 689 nm. At this point we typically obtain
107 88Sr atoms at 2 µK, and 106 86Sr atoms at 1 µK.
The isotopic mixture is then loaded into an optical dipole
trap by superposing a focused 922 nm laser on the red
magneto-optical trap, resulting in a 90 µK deep poten-
tial with radial and axial frequencies of 2 kHz and 26
Hz, respectively. To optimize the transfer eﬃciency from
the red magneto-optical trap into the optical dipole trap,
the optical dipole beam waist is axially displaced from
the magneto-optical trap by 500 µm (corresponding to
2/3 of the dipole beam Rayleigh range and two times
the red magneto-optical trap radii) in order to increase
the magneto-optical trap-dipole trap spatial overlap [23].
The measured 6 s lifetime in the optical trap is consistent
with the residual background gas pressure in our appara-
tus. The oﬀ-resonant photon scattering induces a heating
of 0.4 µK/s. The polarization of the dipole beam is set to
nearly fulﬁll the requirements for trapping at the ”magic
wavelength” that cancels the diﬀerential Stark shift for
the 1S0-3P1 transition [24]. The atom number and tem-
perature are measured independently on the two isotopes
by absorption imaging with a resonant probe beam, and

the contribution of the non-resonant isotope is taken into
account. The spatial density is inferred from the mea-
sured temperature and the trapping potential.

Two-body and three-body collisions are studied by
loading single species or the isotopic mixture into the
optical dipole trap. For the investigation of 2-body elas-
tic collisions, the gas is initially put out of equilibrium by
a sudden perturbation of the optical potential (pure sam-
ples), or by an isotope-selective laser cooling pulse (mix-
ture). We relate the measured thermalization time at the
given density and temperature to the elastic cross-section
σ following and generalizing the approach described in
[25]. The resulting values are σ88−88 = (3 ± 1) × 10−17
m2, σ86−86 = (1.3 ± 0.5) × 10−14 m2, and σ86−88 =
(4 ± 1) × 10−16 m2. In the single isotope case, the results
are consistent with the corresponding scattering lengths
measured by photoassociation spectroscopy [16, 17]. No
previous reference data is available for the two-isotope
collisions.

We studied the 3-body recombination rate K3 by load-
ing a single isotope (either 86Sr or 88Sr) into the dipole
trap and observing the evolution of the atom number
and temperature. With 88Sr we found no experimental
evidence for non-exponential decay and, given the initial
atom density at the trap center of 3 × 1013 cm−3, we set
3 at 10−27 cm6/s. To determine
an upper bound on K 88

where n is the density, and N (t) is the atom number

3 =
(1.0±0.5)×10−24 cm6/s. This recombination rate is more
than three orders of magnitude larger than the typical
values for ultracold alkali vapors [27].

The ﬁrst consequence of these results is that evapora-
tive cooling on pure samples of either 86Sr or 88Sr can-
not be eﬃcient. 86Sr presents an extremely large elastic
cross-section, a good point to establish a fast thermaliza-
tion, but the 3-body recombination rate introduces a loss
channel that is fatal with the typical geometries accessi-
ble through optical dipole trapping. An optical trap with
a much larger trapping volume would partially suppress
this loss channel [28]. 88Sr instead turns out to be stable
against 3-body decay, but the small elastic cross-section
results in a long thermalization time compared to typi-
cal trap lifetime. Indeed, in our experiment evaporative
cooling of 88Sr by reducing the dipole beam intensity al-
lowed to increase the phase-space density to a maximum
of 2×10−1, limited by the reduction of the thermalization

These results led to a new all-optical sympathetic cool-
ing scheme. The basic idea of the new cooling method is
to use a mixture of isotopes trapped in the dipole trap:
one isotope is laser cooled and by elastic collisions cools
the other isotope which is the one of interest. The ad-
vantage, compared to the schemes used so far for neutral
atoms, is that the limitations of laser cooling of spatially
dense and optically thick samples are drastically reduced.
In this work, continuous laser cooling of 86Sr leads to heat
dissipation in a 88Sr sample by sympathetic cooling; the
small 86Sr optical depth does not limit the achievable
minimum temperature. Sympathetic cooling with neu-
tral atoms normally requires a thermal bath with a large
heat capacity with respect to that of the sample to be
cooled. This is due to the fact that when the thermal
bath is cooled by evaporative cooling, each lost atom
carries an energy of the order of few times the temper-
ature of the sample. In the case of optical-sympathetic
cooling, each laser-cooled atom can subtract an energy
of the order of the optical recoil in a time correspond-
ing to a few lifetimes of the excited state (say 4, when
operating at 1/4 Isat), without being lost. Considering
the 1S0-3P1 transition, the power subtracted per atom
is of the order of 6 mK/s; if the inter-isotope thermal-
ization is fast enough, each 86Sr atom can cool about
103 88Sr atoms down to µK temperatures in one sec-
ond. In the 86Sr-88Sr isotope mixture the relatively large
inter-species cross-section results in thermalization times
typically of the order of few milliseconds. This thermal-
ization is fast even on the time scale of laser cooling on
the intercombination 1S0-3P1 transition. On the other

laser cooling on one isotope insensitive to the presence of
the other.
We

implemented the optical-sympathetic cooling
scheme by extending the temporal overlap between the
optical dipole trap and the 86Sr red magneto-optical trap
after switching oﬀ the 88Sr magneto-optical trap. During
this phase the parameters that optimize the 88Sr cooling
are substantially the same as those typically employed
in the second cooling stage (intensity 30-100 Isat with
Isat = 3µW/cm2, -200 kHz frequency detuning, mag-
netic ﬁeld gradient 0.6 mT/cm). The horizontal dis-
placement between the red magneto-optical trap and the
dipole trap optimizes the spatial overlap and provides a
continuous ﬂux of 86Sr atoms from the magneto-optical
trap to the optical dipole trap replacing the atoms that
are lost during the optical-sympathetic cooling due to
light assisted collisions. Figure 2 reports the dynamics
of optical-sympathetic cooling, starting from an initial
temperature of 15-20 µK, limited by density dependent
heating [21, 29]. It can be observed that the cooling pro-
cess does not induce losses on 88Sr while the number of
86Sr atoms exponentially decays with a 80 ms lifetime.
About 100 ms after switching oﬀ the 88Sr red magneto-
optical trap, we observe that the mixture attains thermal
equilibrium. From this point on the equilibrium is main-
tained, which is an essential condition for the implemen-
tation of this cooling scheme. Under optimized condi-
tions (overall optical intensity 100 Isat) the temperature
decays from the initial value with a 150 ms time constant.
The minimum attainable temperature depends both on
the intensity of the 86Sr cooling beam, and the 88Sr den-

sity. Figure 3 reports the asymptotic temperature as a
function of the overall cooling light intensity incident on
the sample, for a ﬁxed amount of trapped 88Sr. At high
intensity, the 86Sr lifetime increases due to the reduced
spatial density and the ﬁnal temperature is proportional
to the intensity as expected from the usual Doppler the-
ory. By lowering the intensity, the ﬁnal temperature and
the 86Sr lifetime decrease to the point where 86Sr is lost
too fast with respect to the cooling dynamics of 88Sr.
The optimum values are obtained when the overall cool-
ing light incident on the atoms has an intensity ∼ 30 Isat.
For 6 × 105 88Sr atoms trapped in the dipole trap, the
ﬁnal temperature is 6.7µK at a peak density of 1.3 × 1014
cm3; the corresponding phase-space density is 5 × 10−2.
This value is only a factor of two lower with respect to
what was previously obtained without forced evaporation
[5], but it exhibits more favorable conditions for starting
evaporative cooling, considering the higher spatial den-
sity (more than one order of magnitude higher) and the
larger number of trapped atoms. By keeping the cooling
parameters on 86Sr ﬁxed at the optimum value and by
varying the number of trapped 88Sr, we determined the
dependence of the ﬁnal temperature with respect to the
88Sr density. Figure 4 shows the dependence of 88Sr tem-
perature from the number of atoms in the trap. We deter-
mine the density-dependent heating dT /dn ≃ 2 µK/(1014
cm−3), which is 20 times lower than the equivalent value
for pure laser cooled 88Sr [29]. This strong reduction
is a direct consequence of the optical distinction of the
two isotopes on the 1S0-3P1 transition. The limit on the
86Sr temperature of 4 µK for zero 88Sr density can be
attributed to the laser cooling dynamics in the tightly
conﬁning potential of the dipole trap. Considering the
power laws involved, reducing the optical dipole poten-
tial in the ﬁnal stage of the optical-sympathetic cooling
should lead to further cooling of the sample and consid-
erably increase the 88Sr phase-space density.

In conclusion, we investigated the collisional properties

We exploit the fast 86Sr-88Sr thermalization to demon-
strate an optical-sympathetic cooling scheme in which
heat dissipation for one isotope is obtained by laser cool-
ing; the sympathetically cooled component is more than
one order of magnitude more abundant than the laser
cooled one, reducing substantially the limitations asso-
ciated to laser cooling at high spatial density. We cool
up to 7 × 105 88Sr atoms at a peak spatial density of
1.4 × 1014 cm−3 and 6 × 10−2 phase space density. The
combination of this cooling scheme to a ﬁnal evapora-
tive cooling stage on pure 88Sr should allow to increase
considerably the phase-space density opening the pos-
sibility to investigate quantum degenerate gases of Sr.
An interesting possibility is also the development of new
atomic sensors based on ultracold Sr atoms exploting the
weak interatomic interaction and their small sensitivity
to magnetic and electric ﬁelds.

of ultracold Sr atoms of interest for the production of a
Bose-Einstein condensate. On pure 86Sr we ﬁnd a very
large 3-body recombination rate which sets stringent lim-
its on the evaporation eﬃciency on this isotope. For 88Sr
we ﬁnd that the small elastic cross-section results in a
long thermalization time compared to typical trap life-
time. This can explain why BEC of Sr was not achieved
so far. On the other hand, for the 86Sr-88Sr mixture we

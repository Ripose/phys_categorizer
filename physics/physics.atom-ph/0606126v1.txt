Abstract We developed a gravity-gradiometer based on atom interferometry for the determination of the
Newtonian gravitational constant G. The apparatus, combining a Rb fountain, Raman interferometry
and a juggling scheme for fast launch of two atomic clouds, was speciﬁcally designed to reduce possible
systematic eﬀects. We present instrument performances and show that the sensor is able to detect the
gravitational ﬁeld induced by source masses. A discussion of projected accuracy for G measurement using
this new scheme shows that the results of the experiment will be signiﬁcant to discriminate between
previous inconsistent values.

Determination of fundamental constants

1 Introduction

Recent advances in atom interferometry led to the devel-
opment of new methods for fundamental physics experi-
ments and for applications [1]. In particular, atom inter-
ferometers are new tools for experimental gravitation as,
for example, for precision measurements of gravity acceler-
ation [2], gravity gradients [3], equivalence principle tests
[4], 1/r2 law test [5,6,7], and for possible applications in
geophysics [2,8]. Ongoing studies show that future exper-
iments in space [5] will allow to take full advantage of
the potential sensitivity of atom interferometers using, for
example, atom gyroscopes [9,10] to test general relativity
predictions [11]. The possibility of using atom interferome-
try for gravitational waves detection was also investigated
[12,13,14].

In this paper, we describe an atom interferometer de-
veloped for a precise determination of the Newtonian grav-
itational constant G. The basic idea of the experiment and
the planned precision were presented in [15]. Here we dis-

cuss the interferometer performances and show that the
sensor is able to detect the gravitational ﬁeld induced by
source masses. The projected accuracy for G measurement
using this new scheme shows that the results of the exper-
iment will be signiﬁcant to discriminate between existing
inconsistent values.

In fact, because of the importance of this fundamen-
tal physical constant, more than 300 experiments were
performed to determine its value but the results are not
in agreement. As a result, the present recommended CO-

DATA value (G = 6.6742(10)
fected by an uncertainty of 150 ppm, which is much larger
than for any other fundamental physical constant [16].
With a few exceptions, most experiments were performed
using conceptually similar schemes based on suspended
macroscopic masses as probes and torsion balances or pen-
dula as detectors.

In our experiment, freely falling atoms act as probes of
the gravitational ﬁeld and an atom interferometry scheme
is used to measure the eﬀect of nearby well-characterized
source masses (Figure 1). 87Rb atoms, trapped and cooled
in a magneto–optical trap (MOT), are launched upwards
in a vertical vacuum tube with a moving optical molasses
scheme, producing an atomic fountain. Near the apogee of
the atomic trajectory, a measurement of their vertical ac-
celeration is performed by a Raman interferometry scheme
[17]. External source masses are positioned in two diﬀer-
ent conﬁgurations and the induced phase shift is measured
as a function of masses positions. In order to suppress
common-mode noise and to reduce systematic eﬀects, a

The interferometer is realized by a sequence of a π/2-
pulse, a π-pulse and π/2-pulse, each separated by the time
T , that produces two possible paths, I and II, in space-
time. The ﬁrst (π/2 pulse) splits the atomic wave packet,
the second (π pulse) induces the internal and external
state inversion and the third (π/2 pulse) recombines the
matter waves after their diﬀerent space–time evolution.
After recombination of the two paths, at the output of
the interferometer the probability of ﬁnding the atoms in
state

shows a typical interference-like behaviour:

ΦI,II are the phases accumulated on path I and II, respec-
tively. The phases ΦI and ΦII depend on the local phase of
the light ﬁeld as seen by the atoms during Raman pulses.
This links the vertical atomic position to the phase evo-
lution of the laser ﬁeld. The phase evolution depends on
ω2(t) and on the

varies the eﬀective frequency linearly in time to compen-
sate for the ﬁrst order Doppler eﬀect of the free-falling

For the measurement of G, we use a Raman interfer-
ometer to detect the change in atoms acceleration induced
by external source masses. In order to achieve high sen-
sitivity and accuracy, however, the experimental scheme
was developed with important speciﬁc features.

First, we launch two clouds of atoms to realize two
fountains that are displaced vertically (see Figure 1). The
Raman pulses act on both clouds simultaneously and gen-
erate two interferometers at the same time. In a detec-
tion of the diﬀerential phase shift between the two inter-
ferometers, spatial homogeneous accelerations cancel and

double-diﬀerential scheme has been adopted. The vertical
acceleration is simultaneously measured in two vertically
separated positions with two atomic samples, that are
launched in rapid sequence with a juggling method. From
the diﬀerential acceleration measurements as a function of
the position of source masses, and from the knowledge of
the mass distribution, the value of G can be determined.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we in-
troduce Raman interferometry and the basic idea of the
experiment to measure G. Section 3 describes the appara-
tus and the experimental sequence. A characterization of
interferometer and gradiometer performaces is presented
in Section 4. In Section 5 we report the detection of exter-
nal source masses. In Section 6, we discuss the expected
performance with the ﬁnal conﬁguration and the projected
accuracy in the measurement of G.

2 Raman interferometry basics and idea of
the experiment

In this section, we discuss the basic idea of the experiment,
the scheme of Raman interferometry and its application
to measure G. A more detailed discussion can be found in
[15] and references therein.

In a Raman interferometry-based gravimeter, atoms in
an atomic fountain are illuminated by a sequence of three
light pulses. The light pulses are realized with two laser
beams, which have frequencies ω1 and ω2 close to transi-
tions of a Λ-type three-level atom with two lower states

common mode measurement noise is reduced. The two-
cloud setup results in an atomic gravity gradiometer. If
the trajectory of the ﬁrst cloud is located above the source
masses, atoms will experience an induced acceleration in
-z direction. In contrast, choosing the trajectory of the
second cloud below the source masses, the induced accel-
eration of this cloud will be in +z direction. Taking the
diﬀerence of these two accelerations yields a signal, which
is about twice the one obtained with only one cloud.

Second, we determine the diﬀerential interferometer
phase shifts with the source masses at distinct positions
(positions 1 and 2 in Figure 1). Evaluating the diﬀer-
ence between the measurements further reduces system-
atic spurious eﬀects if they are constant over the time scale
of the source masses repositioning.

Third, the atomic trajectories and the shape and posi-
tioning of source masses were optimized to reduce experi-
mental sensitivity to crucial parameters like precision and
stability of the atomic fountain.

The combination of these features will allow to reach

the targeted accuracy ∆G/G

10−4.

3 Experimental setup

The experimental apparatus consists of the vacuum cham-
ber, the laser sources and optical set up for the production
of the double fountain of Rb atoms using a juggling proce-
dure, the apparatus for Raman pulse interferometry, and
the system of source masses, their support and precision
positioning components. The experimental sequence, tim-
ing and data acquisition are computer controlled. In this
section, we describe the main parts of the apparatus. More
details can be found in [18].

3.1 Atomic fountain and juggling apparatus

The fountain of 87Rb atoms is produced using a magneto-
optical trap and moving–molasses scheme. The laser beams
are in a 1-1-1 six-beam σ+/σ− conﬁguration. This keeps
the central vertical axis free for the Raman laser beams
and allows to realize a stable and precise atomic fountain.
The relevant parts of the vacuum system are shown in
Figure 1. It consists of three main parts: The lowest part is
a titanium cube with cut edges where atoms are trapped
in the MOT from the vapour produced by a dispenser
(SAES Getters 5G0807), cooled and launched in the foun-
tain. The middle part of the vacuum system is a thermally
demagnetized 316 LN stainless steel cell. This cell is used
for pumping and to detect the atoms. The top part of the
vacuum system is the interferometer tube. It is 1 m long,
has a diameter of 40 mm and is made of titanium. The
tube is magnetically shielded with two coaxial cylinders of
µ–metal (Amuneal) that are 0.76 mm thick and 1 m long,
with internal diameters of 74 mm and 84 mm. The atten-
uation of the radial and axial components of the external
ﬁeld is 76 dB and 69 dB, respectively. The saturation ﬁeld
BS is about 6 mT.

A magnetic ﬁeld gradient of 75 mT/m in the MOT
region is generated by a water-cooled pair of coils in anti–
Helmholtz conﬁguration. The cooling radiation is gener-
ated by a tapered ampliﬁer delivering 500 mW output
power. It is injected with 25 mW from a laser (New Focus
Vortex 6000, 65 mW at 125 mA) frequency–stabilized on
the 5 2S1/2, F=2
5 2P3/2, F=3 transition of 87Rb. This
laser also acts as the main frequency reference for the ex-
periment. The radiation for the MOT is detuned by 3Γ
6.1 MHz) to the red of the resonance.
(Γ = 2π

→

Repumping light is provided by an extended cavity
diode laser, frequency–locked to the reference laser and
optically injecting a slave diode laser.

·

Cooling light is coupled into ﬁbers that are connected
to an integrated ﬁber splitter system (Sch¨after&Kirchhof)
which distributes the light to the 6 MOT beams which
have an intensity of 4.2 mW/cm2 each with 11 mm beam
waist. Each beam is delivered to the MOT region through
a collimator rigidly ﬁxed to the cell. Hyperﬁne repump-
ing light is provided by a beam in one direction with an
intensity of 0.8 mW/cm2.

The atomic cloud is launched into the fountain tube
tube by using the moving molasses method. The laser
beams propagating upwards and downwards are separately
controlled by two acousto–optic modulators (AOMs). By
applying a detuning δω of opposite sign to the upper and
lower beams, the atoms are forced to move along the ver-
tical direction with a velocity

v =

δω
k cos ξ

(3)

where k is the wave vector of the cooling radiation and
ξ the common angle between each of the six beams and
the vertical direction (cos ξ=1/√3). During the launch,
the detuning of the cooling beams in the moving frame
is increased and their intensity is reduced. This sequence
allows to further cool the atomic sample in the moving mo-
lasses frame. The launch sequence for one cloud is realized
in four steps (Figure 2). After the MOT magnetic ﬁeld is
switched oﬀ, the atoms are launched upwards by introduc-
ing a detuning of opposite sign to the three upwards- and
downwards-propagating laser beams. After 2.5 ms, the in-
tensity of the beams is lowered to the saturation intensity
Is = 1.7 mW/cm2 and the mean detuning is increased to
6.3 Γ. After 1.8 ms, the intensity of the cooling beams
−
is reduced by a factor of 2 for 0.3 ms. Finally, the cooling
beams are switched oﬀ, leaving only the repumper beam
on to optically pump the atoms into the F = 2 state. The
temperature of the sample, measured by monitoring its
axial expansion during free fall, is approximately 4 µK.
The number ﬂuctuation from launch to launch is about
3%. The fountain sequence is synchronous with the 50 Hz
power line.

The gradiometer requires two clouds of cold atoms
moving with the same velocity at the same time, but ver-
tically displaced. A vertical separation of 35 cm for atoms

simultaneously on both clouds. The selection is realized
in the vacuum tube, where a uniform vertical bias ﬁeld of
25 µT is applied. The sequence starts by blowing away the
residual population in the F=1 state, by applying a 3 ms
pulse of elliptically polarized radiation resonant with the
F’=0 transition. This beam is tilted with respect
F=1
to the vertical direction so that ∆mF=0,
1 are possible.
A narrow selection of the vertical velocity distribution of
atoms in the F=2,mF=0 is transferred to the F=1,mF=0
state using a 100 µs velocity–selective Raman pulse. The
atoms in the F=2 state are removed from the sample by
applying a circularly polarized vertical beam for 5 ms, res-
onant with the F=2

F’=3 transition.
After the selection sequence, the atoms end up in the
F=1,mF=0 state with a horizontal temperature of 4 µK
and a vertical temperature of 40 nK, corresponding to ve-
locity distribution widths (HWHM) respectively of 3.3 vrec
and 0.3 vrec (vrec = 6 mm/s for Rb resonance transition).

3.3 Raman interferometer apparatus

−

Stimulated Raman transitions are driven by light from
two extended-cavity phase–locked diode lasers, with a rel-
ative frequency diﬀerence equal to the 87Rb ground state
hyperﬁne splitting frequency (νhf=6.835 GHz) and ampli-
ﬁed by a single tapered ampliﬁer. The detuning from the
D2 resonance is

3.3 GHz.

The laser locking system was described in detail in [20].
The two main requirements of the optical phase–locked–
loop (OPLL) are robustness, necessary for continuous op-
eration over long periods of time, and low rms phase error
, a limiting parameter for the interferometer sen-
ph
sitivity. These requirements are accomplished using a de-
tector that combines in a mutually exclusive way a digital
phase and frequency detector and an analog phase detec-
tor. The digital detector allows a capture range of the

propagating beams. The time axis is not to scale.

launched 60 cm and 95 cm above the MOT results in a
launch delay between the two clouds of about 100 ms. The
two atomic clouds are prepared using the juggling tech-
nique [19]. During the ballistic ﬂight of the ﬁrst cloud
of atoms a second cloud is loaded from the backgroud
vapour. Just before the ﬁrst cloud falls down in the MOT
region, the second one is launched. Then, the ﬁrst cloud,
used as a cold and intense source of atoms, is recaptured,
cooled and launched upwards within less than 50 ms (Fig-
ure 3).

To optimize the juggling sequence, several factors must
be taken into account. First, the recapture eﬃciency of
the atomic fountain decreases with the launch height. The
dominant loss process is the scattering with the thermal
background atoms. The loss process due to the thermal
expansion of the cloud during the ﬂight is so far negligi-
ble. Second, the higher the launch of the ﬁrst cloud, the
longer the loading time for the second one. Third, increas-
ing the time used to collect atoms for the ﬁrst cloud has
two opposite eﬀects: the number of recaptured atoms after
the launch is higher, but the experimental repetition rate
is reduced, and so the instrument sensitivity.

In our experimental sequence, the ﬁrst cloud is launched
60 cm upwards, which leads to a loading time of 650 ms
for the second cloud. In this way the number of atoms
launched in each of the two clouds used in the gradiome-
ter is 5

108.

·

3.2 State preparation procedure

After the launch, the atoms are selected both in velocity
and by their mF state. The selection procedure uses ver-
tical beams so that the state preparation can take place

order of 100 MHz, whereas the analog detector ensures a
low noise spectral density necessary for accurate phase–
locking.

The master laser (ML) is an extended-cavity diode
laser (New Focus Vortex 6000, 65 mW at 130 mA). The
slave laser (SL) is an anti–reﬂection coated diode (Sacher
SAL–0780–040, 35 mW at 60 mA) mounted in an ex-
tended cavity. The ML and SL beams are combined on a
polarizing beam splitter (PBS) followed by a linear polar-
izer. One output of the PBS is sent to a fast photodiode to
generate the beat note. The second PBS output injection–
seeds a tapered ampliﬁer, whose astigmatism is corrected
for with a cylindrical lens. A hot Rb cell ﬁlters resonant
light in the spectral wings of the ampliﬁer output.

The pulse timing of the Raman beams during the in-
terferometer sequence is controlled by an AOM, driven by
a waveform generator (Agilent 33220A). After the AOM,
the beams are coupled into a polarization–maintaining
ﬁber, which acts as a spatial ﬁlter. The ﬁber output is
collimated by an aspherical lens (f=1000 mm) to obtain a
beam waist of 10 mm. Most of the optical elements on the
path of the Raman beams have a (λ/20) quality to avoid
phase–front distorsions.

⊥

The Raman beams enter the vacuum system through
the lower window of the MOT cell and exit through the
window at the top of the interferometer tube. After pass-
ing through a quarter–wave plate, they are retroreﬂected
by a mirror, thus obtaining a lin
lin conﬁguration in
the interferometer region. The horizontality of the retrore-
ﬂecting mirror has been adjusted within 20 µrad using a
tiltmeter (Applied Geomechanics 755–1129). Taking into
account the Doppler eﬀect and considering the polariza-
tion of the beams, only Raman transitions with ∆mF=0
are possible for atoms with non zero velocity. To compen-
sate for the varying Doppler shift of the atomic resonance
during the atoms free–fall trajectory, the Raman beams
frequency diﬀerence is linearly swept using a continuous–
phase waveform generator (Agilent 33250A). The central
π pulse of the interferometer sequence is sent 5 ms before
the atoms reach the top of their trajectory, when their
velocity is still high enough to discriminate between up-
wards and downwards propagating Raman beams. For a
Raman beam intensity of 30 mW/cm2, the π pulse lasts
100 µs.

The interferometric phase shifts are detected using the
relative phase of the Raman beams as a reference. To scan
the interferometric fringes, a controlled phase jump φL is
applied after the π pulse to the rf signal generated by the
low–phase–noise reference oscillator (Anritsu MG3692A).

Coils wound between the vacuum tube and the mag-
netic shield enable a precise control of the magnetic ﬁeld
during the interferometer sequence. A solenoid, of 1 m
length, generates a vertical bias magnetic ﬁeld on the z–
axis, chosen as quantization direction in the interferomet-
ric region. A series of 10 coils, each 9 cm long, are used to
add a controlled phase shift via the second–order Zeeman
shift on the atoms during the interferometer sequence.

tube (top view).

3.4 Detection scheme

×

↔

After the interferometric sequence, the population of the
two hyperﬁne sublevels of the ground state is measured in
the intermediate chamber using normalized ﬂuorescence
detection. The falling clouds pass through two horizontal
counterpropagating circularly–polarized beams, vertically
displaced by 20 mm. The beams have a rectangular sec-
6) mm2, and their wave vector k is parallel
tion of (13
to a local magnetic ﬁeld. Each beam has a power of 1 mW
and is resonant with the F=2
F’=3 transition, in order
to interact with atoms in the F=2 state. The lower part of
the higher beam is not retroreﬂected in order to horizon-
tally blow–away the atoms after detection. On the lower
probe beam 0.4 mW of repumping light is overlapped to
optically pump atoms from the F=1 state to the closed
F = 2
F’ = 3 transition. With this conﬁguration, atoms
in the F=2 state are detected with the higher beam and
atoms in the F=1 state with the lower one. The ﬂuores-
cence photons from the two detection regions are collected
by a 5 cm diameter lens (f=100 mm) placed at a distance
of 130 mm and separately focused onto two large area pho-
todiodes (Hamamatsu S7539). The population fractions in
the two states are obtained via normalization, eliminating
the shot–to–shot dependence on atom number. With a
104 detected atoms per cloud in each
typical number of 5
state, the signal-to-noise ratio is 60/1, limited by back-
ground light.

3.5 Source masses set–up

Two sets of masses are used to generate a well–known
gravitational ﬁeld. Each set is made of 12 identical cylin-
ders, symmetrically arranged in a hexagonal conﬁguration
around the vertical axis of the atomic fountain (Figure 4).
The cylinders have a diameter of 100 mm and a height
of 150 mm. The two sets of masses are held by two tita-
nium rings, which are connected to a precision translation
stage speciﬁcally designed for the experiment. This allows
to move vertically the two sets of masses and to position
them at a relative distance ranging between 4 and 50 cm.
The distance is measured with two linear optical encoders

In the ﬁnal conﬁguration for the G measurement, well–
characterized W masses will be used (see Section 6). The
results reported in this paper were instead obtained using
Pb source masses. Each cylinder had a mass of 12.80 kg.
The total mass of the 24 cylinders was 307.2 kg.

4 Atom interferometer operation and
characterization

In the gravimeter conﬁguration, the atom interferome-
ter operating with a single sample of atoms launched in
the fountain, the main phase term is the one induced by
Earth’s gravity

φ(g) = keﬀ g T2
(4)
where ~keﬀ is the momentum transferred to the atoms by
a Raman pulse.

The observed interference signal is shown in Figure 5.
The fraction of atoms in the F=2 state is plotted as a
function of the phase φL, which is electronically added
to the Raman lasers before the ﬁnal π/2 pulse. The to-
tal phase is in this case the sum of φ(g) and φL. Each
data point results from a single launch of an atomic cloud
80 cm above the center of the MOT and requires 5.5 s.
The phase step is 10◦. The phase change due to the vary-
ing Doppler eﬀect during the atoms ﬂight was cancelled
by chirping the lasers’ frequency. Figure 5 compares the
signals recorded without vibration isolation for the mirror
retroreﬂecting the Raman beams (except for the table air
legs with active position stabilization, Newport RS 2000)
and the signal recorded when an active vibration isola-
tion system (HWL Scientiﬁc Instruments AVI 350–M(L))
was used to stabilize the mirror. The signal-to-noise ratio,
deﬁned as the ratio between twice the fringe amplitude
and the rms noise, is 7 in the ﬁrst case and 18 in the
second case. The pulse spacing T can be increased up to
150 ms, but the phase noise induced by mirror vibrations
drastically reduces the fringe visibility. A good phase deﬁ-
nition for the fringes requires a better isolation system for
the mirror and for the table where the atomic fountain is
mounted. A gravity gradient measurement is obtained by
two vertically separated acceleration measurements. The
simultaneous realization of these measurements overcomes
the stringent limit set by phase noise thanks to common-
mode noise rejection. The Raman sequence interval T, as
well as the gradiometer sensitivity, can then be increased
up to the limit set by experimental constraints. If glow and
gup are the gravity acceleration values at the position of
the lower and upper interferometers, the diﬀerential phase
shift is

As discussed above, the gradiometer requires two clouds
of cold atoms moving with the same velocity at the same
time, but vertically displaced. A vertical separation of
35 cm for atoms launched 60 cm and 95 cm above the
MOT requires a launch delay between the two clouds of

by the Earth’s gradient that is constantly present during
the whole set of measurements. This result diﬀers from
the value of 175 mrad produced by the Earth’s gravity
gradient. The diﬀerence can be attributed to the Coriolis
eﬀect.

the relative phase shift can be obtained from its eccentric-
ity and rotation angle. The measured signal-to-noise ratio
is about 100/1 limited by residual amplitude noise.

To adjust the operating point of the gradiometer, a
controlled phase shift was added to the lower interferom-
eter using a magnetic ﬁeld pulse, acting on the mF = 0
atoms via the second–order Zeeman eﬀect. The resulting
phase shift can be written as

For the determination of G, the gradiometer signal will
be detected as a function of the source masses positions so
that rotational contributions cancel and only ﬂuctuations
of the launch direction and height within the measurement
time can aﬀect the signal.

In this case, a knowledge of the pulsed magnetic ﬁeld
is needed for a precise gradient measurement, although
it is not critical in the double–diﬀerential scheme for the
G measurement where only stability matters. The mag-
netic ﬁeld in the interferometric region was mapped for
diﬀerent current values in the bias coils using atoms in
diﬀerent mF sublevels as probes. A sample of cold atoms
in the F = 2 state was repeatedly launched in the interfer-
ometer tube and a selected velocity class was transferred
to the F=1 state with a Raman pulse before reaching the
inversion point. The atomic sample was then transferred
back to the F=2 state with a π Raman pulse and selec-
tively detected. The delay of the second pulse was varied,
in order to interact with the free–falling atoms at diﬀerent
vertical positions. This measurements also provide the op-
timal value for the Raman beams frequency ramp, which
is 25.1354(3) MHz/s corresponding to a gravity acceler-
ation g of 9.8056(1) m/s2. In Figure 7 a direct measure-
ment of the magnetically–induced phase shift is shown.

5 Detection of source masses

In order to test the apparatus and to show the possibil-
ity of detecting the eﬀect of external source masses, the
interferometer was operated in gradiometer conﬁguration
and a set of Pb masses was used.

Pb cylinders had the shape and arrangement as de-
scribed in Section 3.5. Masses were alternately set in the
positions corresponding to the conﬁguration (1) and the
conﬁguration (2) shown in Figure 1. In the ﬁrst case, the
acceleration induced on the atoms in the upper cloud is in
z direction and the acceleration for the lower cloud
the
is in the +z direction. The sign of the induced accelera-
tion is changed, moving the masses to the conﬁguration
(2) with respect to the atomic clouds.

−

In Figure 8, the diﬀerential phase shifts measured for
the two sets of Pb cylinders in the two conﬁgurations are
reported. Considering the diﬀerences between two consec-
utive measurements, the resulting phase shift from the
whole data set is 144(5) mrad, which corresponds to a sen-
10−2
sitivity of 3
in the measurement of G. The total data acquisition time
was about 5 h.

10−9g and a relative uncertainty of 4

·

·

By evaluating the diﬀerence of consecutive measure-
ments, a reduction of systematic eﬀects, due for instance
to spatially inhomogeneous spurious accelerations, Earth’s
gravity gradient, inhomogeneous electric and magnetic ﬁelds
and inertial forces, is achieved.

Figure 8. Gravitational phase shift detected for the two po-
sitions of the source masses. The experiment was performed
with Pb masses and data were analyzed using the ellipse ﬁtting
method. Each data point results from a ﬁt over 288 sequences
with a phase step of 5◦ for the local oscillator. The acquisi-
tion time for each point is 20 minutes. The translation of the
source masses between two consecutive measurements required
∼ 100 s. The full data set for two measurements in diﬀerent
conﬁgurations are also shown in the upper part of the ﬁgure.

6 Towards the measurement of G

To reach the planned accuracy of ∆G/G=10−4 in the mea-
surement of G, an optimization and characterization of the
interferometer and source mass apparatus are required.

The source masses material for the G measurement is a
sintered alloy made of tungsten (95.3%), nickel (3.2%) and
copper (1.5%) (Plansee INERMET IT180). This material
is non–magnetic and has a typical density of (18000
±
200) kg/m3. The 24 cylinders for the experiment come
out of the same furnace run. Then the cylinders undergo
a hot isostatic pressing (HIP) treatment at T=1200◦C,
P=1000 bar which improves the homogeneity of the ma-
terial.

Characterization tests on this material were performed
before and after the HIP treatment. Samples were ob-
served by a microscope to detect internal holes; holes,
with a typical diameter of
150 µm, were reduced to a
∼
negligible size by the HIP treatment. The material mean
density was measured through a double weighting (in air
and in water) at constant temperature. An ultrasonic test
was performed to study its homogeneity that also showed
a signiﬁcative improvement after the HIP procedure. We
measured the dimensions and deviations from the cylin-

precision of 1-2 µm. A sample cylinder was cut into blocks

should not aﬀect the ﬁnal precision planned for the G

The parameters of the atom interferometer must be
optimized considering the shape of the gravitational ﬁeld
produced by the source masses. For the conﬁguration 1 in
Figure 9, selected atomic trajectories will maximize the
phase diﬀerence between the two interferometers. Keep-
ing the same atomic trajectories, the source masses will
be moved to conﬁguration 2 in which the phase diﬀerence
term has minimum sensitivity to the atomic position. In
this way, the interferometers will be realized where the ac-
celeration is stationary for both conﬁgurations. ∆G/G=10−4
can be reached assuming for the atoms a uncertainty of 1
mm for the position and 5 mm/s for the velocity. Higher
levels of precision and accuracy are imposed on the knowl-
edge of the distance between the source masses (10 µm)
and of the relative positioning (100 µm). This will be
achieved by a combination of stable mechanical position-
ing and translation mount and direct optical measurement
of the position of the cylinders during the experiment.

7 Conclusions

The apparatus developed to measure G using a new scheme
based on atom interferometry was presented. The atom
interferometer is used to measure the gravitational ﬁeld
produced by source masses. A diﬀerential scheme, real-
ized by an atom juggling procedure, was implemented
working as a gravity-gradiometer, thus reducing common-
mode noise. The result of a preliminary experiment was
reported, where the eﬀect of Pb source masses was clearly

detected. Further improvements in the Rb atomic foun-
tain, a reduction of noise sources and the use of well char-
acterized W source masses will allow to reach the pro-
jected precision in the measurement of G.

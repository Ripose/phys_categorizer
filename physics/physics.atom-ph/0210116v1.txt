A new ab initio theoretical formulation to calculate Zef f and hence the positron annihilation
rates is presented using the on-shell and half-oﬀshell T-matrix scattering amplitudes without any
explicit use of the scattering wave function. The formulation is exact and universal, as long as the
dynamics of the systems can be described by a Lippmann-Schwinger type equation. It could serve
as an eﬀective tool as all the T −, K−, and S−matrix formulations, yield directly the scattering
amplitudes; not the wave function. We also present a basic numerical test of the formulation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Positron, being an antiparticle, interacts intimately (short-range interaction) with atomic electrons due to the
absence of any restriction imposed by the Pauli Exclusion principle. Thus their annihilation studies, namely, the
Positron annihilation spectroscopy and Positronium annihilation lifetime spectroscopy have emerged as two front line
research areas, as they are expected to provide a more detail account of their close interactions with the target and
bear the potential of various modern technological applications [1–3].

Up until now, the theoretical study of annihilations rate requires the evaluation of the scattering wave function.
However, it is of fundamental importance to note that most scattering calculations (T-, K-, S-matrix) yield directly the
scattering amplitudes; not the wave function. Thus, the evaluation of Zef f normally requires a separate calculation for
the wave function using these scattering amplitudes (like those in ref. [4]), or need to adopt of a diﬀerent methodology
that will yield the scattering wave function directly. Ryzhikh and Mitroy [4] have used the T-matrix formulation to
evaluate the scattering wave function which has subsequently been used to evaluate Zef f . Gribakin [5] has used an
approximate form of the T-matrix equation to evaluate Zef f . Here, we present a new ab-initio theoretical formulation
based on the integral equation formalism, whereby Zef f and hence the annihilation rates can be exactly calculated
using on-shell and half-oﬀshell T-matrix scattering amplitudes but without any explicit use of the scattering wave
function.

Theoretically, the positron annihilation rates (Λ) are expressed in terms of Zef f , the eﬀective number of target

electrons available to the incoming positron as [6–8]:

where r0 is the classical electron radius; c is the speed of light; 4πr2
0c is the non-relativistic electron-positron annihi-
lation rate; πr2
0c is the same for the spin-averaged case of two-gamma annihilation (which excludes electron-positron
triplet state contribution and considers only singlet state annihilation). N is the number density of atoms or molecules
in the medium; δ is the Dirac δ-function; x and rj are the positron and the electron co-ordinates.

Here we present a new formulation whereby the r.h.s of equation 1.2 is represented exactly by the onshell and
half-oﬀshell coupled-channel T-matrix scattering amplitudes, thus facilitating the evaluation of Zef f without any
explicit use of the scattering wave function. When a positron collides with a target, it can have direct as well as
rearrangement scattering. So, we present our formulation in two diﬀerent sections consisting of I) direct (elastic and
inelastic) scattering and II) direct plus rearrangement (positronium formation) scattering.

II. POSITRON ANNIHILATION CONSIDERING THE DIRECT SCATTERING CHANNELS

In this section, we consider the direct scattering of positrons from atomic (φn) targets where the total wave function

is expanded as [9]:

ψ+

k (x, r1, r2, ...rN ) =

Fn(x)φn(r1, r2, ...rN )

Xn

where Fn’s are the expansion coeﬃcients, representing the motion of the positron with momentum k; rj is the
co-ordinate of the j − th electron and x is that of the positron. The total Hamiltonian is partitioned as

where H 0
d is the unperturbed part of the total Hamiltonian in the direct scattering channel of the positron and the
atom and Vd is the positron-atom interaction potential. The unperturbed and the total Hamiltonians satisfy the
following eigen-value equations:

where E = k2/2m − EA is the total energy; EA is the binding energy of the initial target atom (φn); m and k are
the reduced mass and the onshell momentum of the positron. With the eigen-value equations 2.3 and 2.4 for the
unperturbed and the total Hamiltonians, one can write the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the scattering wave
function |ψ+

k i as [9,10]:

Using the closure relation (2π)−3
k i =

elements:

The total scattering wave function can be evaluated from this equation [4]. However, we generally solve it for the
scattering T-matrix amplitudes obtained by multiplying eqn.(2.6) by Vd and projecting with hk′φn′ | and using the

Eqn.(2.7), in its one-dimensional partial-wave form (eqn.2.16), is exactly solved using the matrix inversion method
[11]. Simultaneous equations are formed by replacing k′ with various values of k′′ on which the radial integral over dk′′
is discretized. The solutions of the simultaneous equations give us the both-onshell (hk′φn′ |T |kφni) and half-oﬀshell
(hk′′φn′ |T |kφni) T -matrix amplitudes for various values of k′′, where k, k′ are on shell momenta and k′′ are the oﬀ-
shell ones. While the solutions for the onshell T -matrix elements reﬂect the asymptotic behavior of the wave function
and provide the physical cross sections, the half-oﬀshell elements are usually thrown away. We understand that the
latter might contain the short-range properties of the wave function and they together with the on-shell elements can
N
j=1 δ(x − rj) = ∆, (say) and project it
lead to an exact evaluation of the Zef f . We multiply eqn.2.6 from left by

This equation, although can be solved numerically, needs an extra eﬀort to evaluate the principal value part of the
last term, which contains a product of two singularities arising out of the product of Greens functions. We, therefore,
look for the evaluation of hkφn|∆|ψ+

We solve this equation exactly (which is a very straight forward numerical summation) and substitute the complex
conjugate of hk′φn′ |∆|ψ+
k i in eqn(2.8) to get Zef f . However, like the T-matrix equation, we solve them in their
one-dimensional partial wave form. To arrive at the corresponding partial wave equations for (2.10) and (2.8), we
deﬁne the matrices D and Z as:

∆|ψ+
hψ+

k i = D|kφni
k |D = hkφn|Z

and rewrite eqn(2.10) and eqn(2.8) formally in terms of them:

In terms of partial wave Z-matrices, Zef f (k2) comes out to be:

While eqn.(2.16) is generally used to study positron-atom scattering, eqs.(2.17) and (2.18) are particularly useful to
evaluate Zef f from the onshell and half-oﬀshell T-matrix outputs of eqn.2.16). We shall present a simple numerical
account on e+-He scattering to verify the code and compare the numbers, but beforehand we present a general formula
for Zef f by inserting eqn.(2.17) into eqn.(2.18). This latter is of particular interest, as it will explicitly demonstrate
how the Zef f is dependent on the T-matrices. For this, we ﬁrst rewrite eqs.(2.16), (2.17) and (2.18) in the following

Zkk = ∆kk + i∆kk[T

where ∆pq corresponds to plane-wave value of Zef f for the initial and ﬁnal momenta p and q. Im[Tkk] and |Tkk|2
are proportional to physical cross sections (representing the asymptotic behavior of the wave function). Others are
interference terms, linear and quadratic in the half-oﬀshell T-matrix elements, and expected to play a crucial role at
low and intermediate energies. To understand their role, and to check the normalizations of equations 2.17 and 2.18,
we provide a numerical test below.

A. Numerical test to equations 2.17, 2.18

To test the formulations of the equations 2.17, 2.18 (Equation 2.16 is well established in literature) we perform
sample calculation on e+-He elastic scattering, considering only the static interaction [keeping summation over τ ′′ ≡
He(1s2)], and evaluate the Zef f using the resulting onshell and half-oﬀshell T-matrix elements. We use atomic units
throughout and use delta-function normalization for the plane wave.

We note that equations {2.16,2.17,2.18} and {2.20,2.21,2.22} are equivalent. In ﬁgure 1, ﬁrst we plot the dotted
curve which is obtained considering only the plane wave parts (ﬁrst term of the r.h.s) of eqs.(2.20), (2.21) and (2.22).
This plane wave approximation gives a value of Zef f = 2.0(= Z) as was expected and provides the normalization.
Next we consider ﬁrst two terms of the r.h.s of eqs.(2.20), (2.21) and (2.22) and plot the result as dashed curve. This
approximation is equivalent of considering the plane wave and the onshell T-matrix contributions of equations (2.16),
(2.17) and (2.18) leaving aside the half-oﬀshell contribution (particular integral part of the Greens function). We
obtain a lower value of Zef f with increasing energies, signaling the manifestation of a repulsive potential at higher
energies. Now, the solid curve is obtained with all the three terms of eqs.(2.20), (2.21), and (2.22). That is, considering
both the onshell and the half-oﬀshell contributions together with the plane wave. The static potential in a e+-He
scattering is repulsive and consequently it lowers the value of Zef f (and hence the annihilation rate). We compare the
solid curve with the results of a Schwinger Multi-Channel (SMC) calculation on e+-He with the same physical content
(considering static interaction only) [12]. Both the curves agree quite well. The marginal diﬀerence in the Zef f value
between the present and the SMC calculation is supposed to be acceptable since, the wave functions for Helium used
in these two calculations are diﬀerent (we use the Roothaan-Hatree-Fock ﬁve-term wave function of Clementi and
Roetti [13] for He) and also the T-matrix and the SMC formulations are diﬀerent.

The results provided in ﬁgure-1 are aimed at checking the new equations vis-a-vis other methodologies where we
considered the static interaction. Formally, to arrive at a physically converged result for the Zef f , full expansion
basis indicated in equations 2.17 and 2.18 need to be employed like the case for the scattering T-matrix equation
2.16. However, in practice it has been found that the positron-scattering cross sections do not converge easily unless

5

real and virtual eﬀects of the rearrangement channel of positronium (Ps) formation is considered in the theoretical
formulation. So, for a converged description of the scattering and annihilation we need to consider the Ps formation
channel explicitly in the theoretical formulation. However, the above formulation is suitable for employing model
polarization potentials alongside the static potential so as to arrive at a meaningful physically converged result
without being conﬁned in the ab initio framework.

III. POSITRON ANNIHILATION CONSIDERING THE DIRECT AND THE PS-FORMATION
CHANNELS.

When the possibility of a real or virtual positronium formation is considered, through the capture of a target
electron by the incident positron, the theoretical formulation for a single electron target diﬀers from a multi electron
target in the sense that for the latter case the Ps-target(ion) wave function need to be formally antisymmetrized.
Here, we discuss them in two diﬀerent sections A and B.

For positron scattering from a single electron target, the total wave function (2.1) can be expanded (considering Ps

formation) as [9,14]:

The above two equations are very straight forward to solve as one need to carry only numerical integrations with
known values of Td, Tc and the calculated plane-wave matrix elements concerning ∆ as inputs. We are not interested
to repeat the calculations for Td and Tc and rather hope that the existing T-matrix results [16] may be applied to
calculate Zef f .

For multi-electron targets the formulation is very much similar to that of section IIA, except few fundamental
changes. Without repeating the whole thing, we thus mention here about the necessary changes. For the positron
scattering from a multi-electron target, the capture channel need to be explicitly antisymmetrized and expressed as:

ψ+

k (x, r1, r2, ..rN ) =

Xn

Fn(x)φn(r1, ...., rN ) + A1

Gνµ(ρ1)χν (t1)ϕµ(r2, ..., rN )

where ϕ represents the residual target ion and A1 is the antisymmetrization operator, which antisymmetrizes electron
1 with other target electrons. The initial target wave function φ is supposed to be antisymmetrized implicitly. The
total Hamiltonian is now partitioned as: H = H 0
c(j) and Vc(j) are the unperturbed
Hamiltonian and the Ps-target(ion) interaction potential in the capture channel of the positronium formation, with
the j-th electron being attached to the positron. Accommodating the Pauli exclusion principle for the rearrangement
channel, the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation is now written as:

c(j) + Vc(j); where H 0

d + Vd = H 0

where Td and Tc are deﬁned as Vd|ψ+
following closure relations for the direct and the rearrangement channels:

k i = Td|kφni (here Td ≡ T of section-I) and Vc(j)|ψ+

k i = Tc(j)|kφni. Using

|ψ+

k i = |kφni + G0

The rest of the procedures are exactly similar to those described in section IIA and are not repeated here.

In summary, we present a new ab initio methodology to calculate Zef f from physical (onshell) and virtual (half-
oﬀshell) scattering T-matrix amplitudes, without any use of the scattering wave function. The formulation presented
here is for positron annihilation in atoms, but it could be universally applied to other annihilation studies as long
as the dynamics of the interacting particles (or clusters) can be described by the well-known Lippmann-Schwinger
type equation. The methodology is exact and can act as an useful tool for the annihilation studies as most of
the scattering theories (T-matrix, K-matrix, S-matrix) yield directly the scattering amplitudes. Performing elastic
scattering and employing elastic-channel T-matrix amplitudes (on- and oﬀ-shell) we reproduce the corresponding Zef f
result and demonstrate the utility of the methodology. A similar T-matrix formulation for the pick-oﬀ annihilation
of ortho-positronium is under way and will be published soon.

We present results of ﬁrst-principles calculations of the frequency-dependent polarizabilities of all
alkali atoms for light in the wavelength range 300-1600 nm, with particular attention to wavelengths
of common infrared lasers. We parameterize our results so that they can be extended accurately
to arbitrary wavelengths above 800 nm. This work is motivated by recent experiments involving
simultaneous optical trapping of two diﬀerent alkali species. Our data can be used to predict
the oscillation frequencies of optically-trapped atoms, and particularly the ratios of frequencies of
diﬀerent species held in the same trap. We identify wavelengths at which two diﬀerent alkali atoms
have the same oscillation frequency.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The trapping of two diﬀerent species of ultracold gases
has been an active topic of research for about ten years
(see [1] and references therein), and has led to the simul-
taneous production of quantum degenerate Bose-Einstein
and Fermi-Dirac gases [2, 3, 4] and recently to the ob-
servation of heteronuclear Feshbach resonances involving
Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac species [5, 6].

Two recent experiments [5, 6] provide a glimpse of
the possibilities of mapping out the phase diagram of
a Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac mixture, potentially a rich
system that remains to be explored. Our present work
provides accurate estimates of the trapping frequencies of
disparate species conﬁned in the same optical trap. We
have been attentive to ﬁnding cases in which all species,
Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac atoms, and the molecules
formed from them, have the same trapping frequencies.
This case is of particular interest because it has been
shown to be optimal for a recently proposed scheme of
In addi-
cooling mediated by Feshbach resonances [7].
tion, we note that while the DC polarizabilities of alkali
atoms have been subject to careful experimental inves-
tigation, there is relatively little accurate experimental
data on frequency-dependent polarizabilities. We draw
attention to the fact that current experiments oﬀer the
possibility of measurements of unprecedented accuracy
regarding the ratio of frequency-dependent polarizabili-
ties of diﬀerent species. Such measurements could pro-
vide more decisive comparison of ab initio atomic theory
with experiments, than has been made to date.

We begin with a summary of the calculation of
frequency-dependent polarizabilities, the details of which
have been presented in previous publications [8, 9].
The computational method we use here has delivered
agreement with experiments on static polarizabilities at
the 1% level. There are few direct measurements of

frequency-dependent polarizabilities - the experiments
are much more demanding, and have larger uncertain-
ties associated with modeling the intensity proﬁle of a
focused laser beam. However, the alkali metal atoms are
a special case, at least in the infrared spectral region.
There, the polarizability is dominated by the contribu-
tion from the longest-wavelength resonance transitions,
and it is possible to perform consistency checks between
static values and long-wavelength values of the frequency-
dependent atomic polarizabilities. We present tabulated
values of calculated frequency-dependent polarizabilities
over a range of wavelengths from the ultraviolet through
the infrared spectrum, with particular attention to those
wavelengths (primarily in the infrared) which have been
or might be employed in the present generation of op-
tical traps. For the infrared region, we display simple
formulae that allow accurate computation of frequency-
dependent polarizabilities for wavelengths not explicitly
reported upon here.

Finally, we enumerate selected wavelengths, at which
two species of optically-trapped alkali atoms would have
the same frequencies of oscillation in a common optical
trap. Such wavelengths oﬀer opportunities for mapping
out phase diagrams of Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac
mixtures in a space of reduced dimensionality. Moreover,
to the extent that molecular resonances consist of weakly
bound states at large internuclear separation, the oscil-
lation frequencies of trapped molecular species should be
very close to the frequencies of their atomic components.
This may present an ideal system for investigation.

II. CALCULATION OF POLARIZABILITIES

The frequency-dependent polarizability of an atom in
its ground state may be separated into polarizability of
the ionic core αcore and the valence contribution αns

The calculation of the core polarizability is carried out in
the random-phase approximation (RPA); we veriﬁed that
our static values agree with RPA values from Ref. [10].
The separation of the polarizability into core and valence
parts also requires the addition of the compensation term
αvc which accounts for the contribution from the excita-
tion to the occupied valence shell that is forbidden by
the Pauli exclusion principle. The calculation of the core
polarizability does not exclude the excitation from the
core to the valence shell and half of this contribution has
to be subtracted. Thus, the polarizability contributions
may be separated as

αns = αcore + αvc + αns
v .

for the next three terms (for example n′ = 4, 5, 6 terms

detailed description of the single-double (SD) all-order
method and its extensions. The all-order values of the
matrix elements are evaluated for their accuracy, and the
extensions of the SD all-order method (SDpT, which par-
tially includes triple excitations or SDsc, which includes

be of better accuracy. The uncertainty of the resulting

comparison of various atomic properties of alkali-metal
atoms with experiment [9, 11, 13], and the spread of
SD, SDpT, and SDsc values. Some of these values were
published previously in Refs. [11, 14]. The experimental
7p3/2
values from [14] are used for 6s
transitions. In summary, the set of values used for the
calculation of the ﬁrst four terms in the sum over states
of Eq.(2) consists of the best known values for these tran-
sitions. The experimental energies from Refs. [15, 16] are
used for the corresponding energy levels. We refer to the
total contribution from the ﬁrst four terms as the main
term; the remaining contributions are referred to below
as the tail contribution; i.e.

We evaluated the tail contributions with a complete
set of basis Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) wave functions
generated using the B-spline method [17]. We use 40
splines of order k = 7 for each angular momentum. The
basis set orbitals are deﬁned on a non-linear grid and
are constrained to a large spherical cavity of a radius
110 a.u. The cavity radius is chosen to ac-
R = 75
commodate ﬁrst four ns, np1/2, and np3/2 valence or-
bitals. For consistency, we use the same basis sets for
the tail calculations as we used in the all-order calcula-
tion of the main term matrix elements. The tail con-
tribution is calculated in the DHF approximation. We
list our results for the frequency-dependent polarizabil-
ities from the ultraviolet through the infrared spectrum
in Table I. Particular attention is given to the values
for the infrared wavelengths which have been or might
be employed in the present generation of optical traps.
Our values of the ac polarizabilities are accurate to better
than 0.5% with the exception of the values correspond-
ing to wavelengths in the ultraviolet spectrum. For these
wavelengths, non-primary resonances become dominant
and the uncertainty of the polarizability values is domi-
nated by the uncertainty in the corresponding resonance
matrix elements. For example, the ﬁrst resonances in Rb

III. RESULTS

We have investigated the dependence on the frequency
ω of all of the terms contributing to αns, where ns is the
ground state. We ﬁnd that the αcore, αvc, αtail, and αns

terms with n′ = n + 1, n + 2, n + 3 depend weakly on the
value of ω for wavelengths above 800 nm. In fact, it is
possible to accurately parameterize the values of the ac

than 0.1% which is signiﬁcantly below the accuracy of
the values themselves. We note that the formula (4) is
not applicable for the lower wavelengths owing to the im-
portance of the other n′p
ns resonances. For example,
the 420 nm wavelength corresponds to 6p
5s transition
in Rb; therefore, the ground state polarizability at this
frequency will be dominated by the n′ = 6 term.

IV. THE FREQUENCY-MATCHING CRITERIA
FOR MIXED SPECIES

We have also conducted a search of the wavelength val-
ues at which two species of optically-trapped alkali atoms
(6Li, 7Li, 23Na, 40K,41K, 87Rb, 133Cs, and 210Fr) would
have the same frequencies of oscillation in a common op-
tical trap, i.e. λ such that

where mi is the atomic weight [19]. The wavelengths of
those selected matches and their uncertainties are listed
in Table III. We have omitted all matches at wavelengths
below 500 nm. While we had found numerous matches
in the range from 300 nm to 500 nm they are diﬃcult
to place accurately since the accuracy of our calcula-
tion is lower in this region. The width of the matches
500 nm region is generally very narrow and
in the 300
the corresponding values of the polarizabilities are small,
making them of limited experimental use. We deﬁne the
width of the match as the wavelength range where the
parameter s given by Eq. (5) is between 0.9 and 1.1. The
width of the match is very narrow if the corresponding
wavelength is in the immediate vicinity of the resonance.
We have also omitted most matches at higher wave-
lengths from Table III that are close to the resonance.

Note that we listed the values of the wavelengths in the
air. While the diﬀerence between air and vacuum wave-
0.4 nm, it
lengths is small in the considered region, 0.15
is suﬃcient to cause changes in the frequency-dependent
polarizabilities (at some wavelengths) which exceed the
uncertainties of the calculations. We used the following
formula to compute the wavelength in air from the vac-
uum wavelength[20]

The wavenumber σ is here to be expressed in reciprocal
nm. We also list the values of the ac polarizabilities and
their uncertainties in Table III.

The uncertainty in the wavelength of the match results
from the uncertainties in the values of the frequency-
dependent polarizabilities α1(λ) and α2(λ) given in Ta-
ble III. The uncertainties in the values of α(λ) are found
to be independent of λ within the range of the match to
a very good precision but are generally diﬀerent for α1
and α2. We calculate the resulting uncertainties δλ1 and
δλ2 due to uncertainties in the values of α1 and α2 sep-
arately and add the results in quadrature to obtain the
ﬁnal uncertainty δλ. To evaluate δλ1, we calculate the
±
α
δα1]/m1 and then determine the
1 (ω)/m1 = [α1(λ)
±
wavelengths λ± at which α
1 (λ)/m1 = α2(λ)/m2. The
maximum of the diﬀerences between the initial match
wavelength and λ± is taken to be the uncertainty δλ1.
The evaluation of δλ2 is done in the same way.

We illustrate several of the matches given in Table III
in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The ratios α(λ)/m of frequency-
dependent polarizabilities to the atomic weights for Li
and Na in the wavelength range 500-800 nm are plotted
in Fig. 1. The corresponding matches are shown by the
arrows and the corresponding wavelengths are given on

Two of the matches, at 589.397 nm and 670.79 nm, are
very close to the resonances and, therefore, are not listed
in Table III as discussed before. The match areas for
those cases are extremely narrow and the polarizability
of the corresponding alkali is very sensitive to very small
changes in the wavelength. Fig. 2 shows similar plot to
illustrate the wavelengths at which 40K and 87Rb have
the same frequencies of oscillation in a common optical
trap in the range 740-820 nm.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we conducted a systematic study of the
ground state frequency-dependent polarizabilities of the
alkali atoms from ultraviolet through infrared spectral
regions. The values of the ac polarizabilities and their
uncertainties are calculated for a number of wavelengths,
including the wavelengths of common infrared lasers.
A combination of high-precision measurements of the
ratios of frequency-dependent polarizabilities of diﬀerent
species could provide excellent tests of the current
experimental and theoretical values of the electric-dipole
matrix elements in alkali-metal atoms. We provide
formulas and the necessary parameters for the accurate
calculation of the ac polarizabilities for all alkali-metal
atoms at wavelengths above 800 nm. Finally, we list
selected wavelengths at which two species of alkali atoms
would have the same oscillation frequencies in a common
optical trap.

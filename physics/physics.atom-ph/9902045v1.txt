The motion of atoms in a dark magneto-optical lattice is considered. This lattice is formed by a
non-uniformly polarized laser ﬁeld in the presence of a static magnetic ﬁeld. Cold atoms are localized
in the vicinity of points where dark states are not destroyed by a magnetic ﬁeld. As a result the
optical interaction tends to zero (dark or gray lattices). Depending on the ﬁeld conﬁguration such a
lattice can exhibit one or two-dimensional periodicity. It is shown that in 1D and 2D dark magneto-
optical lattices the eﬀects connected with the Bose-statistics of particles can be observed under the
−6K and densities 1011 − 1012cm−3, those are usual for current experiments

I. INTRODUCTION

After the outstanding experiments on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of an atomic gas in a magnetic
[1–3] studies of phenomenon originated from quantum statistics of particles became one of the main subjects
contemporary atomic physics. Achieving of BEC by optical means is of especial interest [4–7]. On the one
this allows deeper understanding of the nature and physical properties of condensates under various conditions.
the other hand, the works in this direction may lead to new eﬀective methods of super-deep cooling. It is w
noting, that in the refs. [1–3] laser ﬁelds play an auxiliary role and they are used for precooling down to suﬃcien
low temperatures with successive evaporating cooling in a magnetic trap, when in the ﬁnal stage of experimen
optical ﬁelds are absent and the main part of atoms escape from a trap under evaporative cooling. One of the
components of the optical methods [4,6] is the formation of a non-dissipative optical or magneto-optical poten
when atoms scatter photons with very low rates. There exist two principal ways to solving this problem. The ﬁrst
consists in the use of far-oﬀ-resonance light ﬁelds with the high intensity [4,6,8]. In this case the potential depth
order of 103 εr (εr = (¯hk)2/2M is the single-photon recoil energy) and the rate of spontaneous photon scattering ab
1 s−1 are achived [6,7]. Another way is connected with the use of coherent population trapping (CPT) phenomena
in near-resonance light ﬁelds. As is known [9], under the resonance interaction of a polarized radiation with atoms,
having optical transitions Fg = F
1 (g and e denote
the ground and excited states respectively), there exist dark states. These states are coherent superposition of
ground-level Zeeman substates, which is fully decoupled with light (
= 0. Due to optical pumping atoms
are trapped in these states and do not scatter light. The use of ﬁelds with a polarization gradient allows to create
a potential in dark states (dark potential). Although for dark states ac Stark shift vanishes, dark potentials can
created by the atomic translational motion (so-called gauge or geometric potentials) [10–12], or by applying of a static
(magnetic or electric) ﬁeld. In the later case the atomic multipole moments are spatially non-uniform, that leads
the coordinate dependence of the interaction energy with a static ﬁeld. As a result, a periodic potential is formed.
From the other hand, static ﬁelds induce precession of multipole moments and destroy dark states. However,
eﬀect can be suppressed to negligible values due up to two factors:

Fe = F with F an integer and Fg = F

1. We can choose a speciﬁc geometry of ﬁelds [13] where atoms are localized near the points, where dark states

are not destroyed by a static ﬁeld.

2. The use of high-intensity laser ﬁeld allows to lack atoms in dark states. In the result, as is shown in ref.

can obtain a very deep potential with a large spatial gradient. Both these reasons lead to the large energy separation

In the present paper, with Fg = 1

Fe = 1 transition as an example, one- and two-dimensional non-dissipativ

magneto-optical lattices are considered with especial attention to the formation of atomic structures with lo
dimensions (2D – planes, 1D – lines). In such a lattice the spontaneous scattering of photons is strongly reduced
the main dissipative mechanism is elastic interatomic collisions. In the framework of an ideal Bose-gas model
shown that under applying of an additional weak conﬁning potential, the condensation is possible at the temperatures
and densities typical for the current experiments on laser cooling.

It is worth noting, in the low-saturation limit, that corresponds to the dissipative regime, dark magneto-optical

lattices had been theoretically [15] and experimentally [16] studied. Sub-Doppler cooling down to 20 εr had
predicted and observed. Experimental evidence of the translational motion quantization had been presented.

III. IDEAL BOSE-GAS IN DARK MAGNETO-OPTICAL LATTICES

which corresponds to the thermodynamic equilibrium. In the present paper we restrict our treatment by the
gas model when the contribution of atom-atom interactions into the system energy is negligible. At the same
collisions are implicitly taken into account as a reason of the thermal equilibrium.

BEC is one of the most interesting phenomenon arising in a Bose gas under suﬃciently low temperatures. As it
been shown by recent studies, the character and parameters of the phase transition essentially depend on the system
dimensions and on the presence of an external conﬁning potential. So, it is well-known [?], that in the case of a
gas BEC in the 1D and 2D cases is absent. However, as it has been recently shown in refs. [19,20] in both 1D and
cases BEC becomes possible under applying a conﬁning potential. Moreover, the conditions for the BEC achievemen
are appreciably less stringent than in the 3D case.

The non-dissipative dark magneto-optical lattice considered in the previous section are promising tools for studies

of BEC in systems with lower dimensions. Let us consider the concrete examples.

A. 1D lattice – 2D condensation

The simplest realization of 1D dark magneto-optical lattice is the lin

lin light ﬁeld conﬁguration plus a magnetic

ﬁeld directed along the wave prorogation direction (see in ﬁg.2). Here the dark magneto-optical potential has
form [14]:

⊥

Atoms are localized in the planes zn = λn/2, where the ﬁeld has the σ− polarization and the dark state coincides
with the Zeeman substate
ization of atoms in the vicinity of the single well bottom, when tunneling between wells is negligible. Basing
harmonic approximation, one can ﬁnd the energy separation between the lower levels ∆ε = √8¯hΩε. Then under
temperatures

atoms are in the vibrational ground state. In the other words, the translational motion of atoms along z is frozen.
For instance, for the D1-line of 87Rb (λ = 787 nm) under the magnetic ﬁeld amplitude B
4 G freezing is achiv
at T < 10−5K. Due to the absence of tunneling, each of localization planes can be considered as an independen
thermodynamic and mechanical system, where particles freely move along the x and y axes.

If an additional conﬁning (in the xy-plane) potential is applied (for example, far-oﬀ-resonance optical shift),
BEC can be reached in a single plane. As it was shown in ref. [20], for 2D harmonic potential with the frequency
the expression for the transition temperature is given by:

In the case under consideration BEC can be observed, for instance, by the time-of-ﬂight measurements of the atomic
momentum distribution after turning oﬀ of a conﬁning potential. It should be noted that the phases of condensates
in each planes are independent. So, if the lattice is considered as whole, we have the quasicondensation only.

B. 2D lattice – 1D condensation

The example of three-beam ﬁeld conﬁguration where the 2D dark magneto-optical potential is formed is sho
in ﬁg.3. Here the three wave-vectors lie in the xy-plane and make an angle 2π/3 one with another. The linear
polarizations of beams make the same angle φ
= 0, π/2 with the z-axis. This angle φ can be varied in a wide domain.
The main reason for the inequality φ

= π/2 is the fact that in the case of φ = π/2 there exist lines, where the

Atoms are localized in the vicinity of straight lines, where the ﬁeld has σ− circular polarization. In the same manner
as in the previous section, one can show that under suﬃciently low temperatures kBT < √¯hΩεr the translational
degrees of freedom along x and y are frozen out. Each of lovalization lines can be considered as an independen
system. Under applying of a conﬁning (along z) harmonic potential we have the condensation at the temperature

1 Introduction

The complete αZ-dependence formulas for the nuclear recoil corrections to
the energy levels of hydrogenlike atoms in the case of a point nucleus were
ﬁrst obtained by a quasipotential method [1] and subsequently rederived by
diﬀerent approaches [2-4]. According to [4], the nuclear size corrections to the
recoil eﬀect can be partially included in these formulas by a replacement of
the pure Coulomb potential with the potential of an extended nucleus. The
total recoil correction for a state a of a hydrogenlike atom is conveniently
written as the sum of a low-order term ∆EL and a higher-order term ∆EH
[1], where (¯h = c = 1)

part of the nuclear size eﬀect since using the extended nucleus wave function
and the extended nucleus Green function strongly reduces the singularities
of the integrands in (1) and (2) in the nuclear region.

The term ∆EL contains all the recoil corrections within the (αZ)4m2/M
approximation. Its calculation for a point nucleus, based on the virial rela-
tions for the Dirac equation [5-7], yields [1]

∆EL =

(3)

where εa0 is the Dirac electron energy for the point nucleus case.

∆EH contains the contribution of order (αZ)5m2/M and all contributions
of higher order in αZ. To lowest order in αZ, this term represents the
Salpeter correction [8]. The calculation of this term to all orders in αZ
was performed in [9,10] for the case of a point nucleus. According to these
calculations, the recoil correction to the Lamb shift of the 1s state in hydrogen
constitutes –7.1(9) kHz, in addition to the Salpeter term. This value is close
to the (αZ)6m2/M correction (–7.4 kHz) found in [3] and is clearly distinct
from a recent result for the (αZ)6m2/M correction (–16.4 kHz) obtained in
[11]. (The (αZ)6 log (αZ)m2/M corrections cancel each other [12,13].) The
total recoil correction to the ground state energy in 238U91+ was calculated
in [9] to be 0.51 eV.

In this work we calculate the recoil correction to the ground state energy
of hydrogenlike atoms in the range Z=1–110 using the formulas (1) and (2)
employing the potential of an extended nucleus.

2 Low-order term

Using the virial relations for the Dirac equation in a central ﬁeld [7], the
formula (1) can be transformed to (see Appendix)

The ﬁrst term on the right side of equation (4) corresponds to the low-order
recoil correction for the point nucleus (see Eq. (3)). The second term gives
the nuclear size correction . We calculate this term for the uniformly charged
nucleus. In Table I, we display the results of this calculation for the the 1s
state. The values are expressed in terms of the function ∆FL(αZ) which is
deﬁned by

the contribution of this term to ∆PL is

We will see in the next section that this term cancels with the corresponding
correction to the Coulomb part of the higher-order term. This implies that
the sum of the low-order and higher-order contributions is more regular at
r

0 than each of them separately.

3 Higher-order term

To calculate the higher-order term (2) we transform it in the same way as it
was done in [9]. The ﬁnal expressions are given by the equations (41)-(54) of
Ref. [9] where the pure Coulomb potential (VC(r) =
αZ/r) in the equations
(42) and (48) has to replaced by the potential of the extended nucleus V (r).
We calculate these expressions for the uniformly charged nucleus by using the
ﬁnite basis set method with the basis functions constructed from B-splines

[14]. The algorithm of the numerical procedure is the same as it is described
in [9]. The results of the calculation for the 1s state are presented in the
second column of the Table II. They are expressed in terms of the function
P (αZ) deﬁned by

results from [9]. In the fourth column of the table, the diﬀerence ∆P = P

It is comparable with the deviation of the complete αZ-dependence value
from the Salpeter contribution (in the case of hydrogen ∆P =

corresponding result (∆P = 0.0092(2)) from the Table II.

4 Discussion

In this work we have calculated the recoil correction to the ground state
energy of hydrogenlike atoms for extended nuclei in the range Z = 1
110.
This correction is conveniently written in the form

(23)

The function PF S(αZ) = P (αZ) + ∆PL(αZ) is shown in Fig. 1. For compar-
ison, the point nucleus function P0(αZ) and the Salpeter function PS(αZ)
are also presented in this ﬁgure. The Table III displays the values of the
recoil corrections (in eV) in the range Z=10–110.

In the case of hydrogen we ﬁnd that the recoil correction amounts to
7.2(2) kHz beyond the Salpeter contribution and the nonrelativistic

almost coincides with the point nucleus result. This is caused by the fact
that the nuclear size correction to the higher-order term (Eq. (22)) and the
relativistic nuclear size correction to the low-order term (Eq. (14)) cancel
each other.

For high Z, where the αZ expansion as well as the reduced mass approx-
imation are not valid any more, we should not separate any contributions
from the total recoil eﬀect. In the case of hydrogenlike uranium (238U91+),
the total recoil correction constitutes ∆E = ∆EL + ∆EH = 0.46 eV and is
by 10 % smaller than the corresponding point nucleus value (∆Ep.n. = 0.51
eV) found in [9]. This improvement aﬀects the current numbers of the Lamb
shift prediction [17].

Finally, we note a very signiﬁcant amount of the nuclear size eﬀect for
Z=110. According to the Table III, the ﬁnite nuclear size modiﬁes the point
nucleus result by more than 40%.

Table 2: Higher-order term for the 1s state expressed in terms of the function
P (αZ) deﬁned by Eq. (15). The nuclear radii employed in the calculation
are the same as in Table I. P0(αZ) is the related value for the point nucleus
and ∆P = P
P0. PS(αZ) is the Salpeter contribution obtained by Eq.
(16).

Table 3: Recoil corrections in eV. For comparison, the nonrelativistic recoil
correction is given separately. The last column displays the deviation from
the point nucleus results for the total recoil eﬀect. The mass values are given
in nuclear mass units. They were taken from [24], except for Z = 110 where
we adopted the value of [21].

Abstract

We have performed relativistic many-body calculations of the hyperﬁne inter-
action in the 6s and 7s states of Cs, including the oﬀ-diagonal matrix element.
The calculations were used to determine the accuracy of the semi-empirical
formula for the electromagnetic transition amplitude h6s|M 1|7si induced by
the hyperﬁne interaction. We have found that even though the contribution
of the many-body eﬀects into the matrix elements is very large, the square
root formula h6s|Hhf s|7si = qh6s|Hhf s|6sih7s|Hhf s|7si remains valid to the
accuracy of a fraction of 10−3. The result for the M1-amplitude is used in the
interpretation of the parity-violation measurement in the 6s − 7s transition
in Cs which claims a possible deviation from the Standard model.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent progress in highly accurate measurements of parity non-conservation (PNC) in
atoms has got to the point where new physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary
particles can be studied. The latest analysis [1] of the most precise measurements of the
PNC in cesium [2] suggests that the value of the weak charge of the 133Cs nucleus may diﬀer
from the prediction of the Standard Model. In that experiment [2] the ratio of the PNC E1
amplitude to the tensor polarizability β for the 7S1/2 − 6S1/2 transition was measured with
0.35% accuracy. The measured value can be written in the form

kP N C

β

QW
N

,

(1)

where kP N C is the electron matrix element of the electric dipole transition induced by the
weak interaction between 7S1/2 and 6S1/2 states of 133Cs, QW is the weak nuclear charge
and N is the number of neutrons. To interpret the measurements in terms of the weak
nuclear charge one needs to know kP N C and β. The value of kP N C can be obtained from
atomic calculations only. Bennett and Wieman [1] used the value kPNC = 0.9065(36)iea0
which is the average of our result kPNC = 0.908(9)iea0 [3] obtained in 1989 and the result
of the Notre-Dame group kPNC = 0.905(9)iea0 [4] obtained in 1990. Note that Bennett and
Wieman assumed 0.4% accuracy of the calculations contrary to the 1% accuracy claimed in
both calculations. This assumption was based on the comparison of the calculated atomic
quantities relevant to the PNC amplitude (electromagnetic transition amplitudes between
lower s and p states and hyperﬁne structure intervals of these states) with the latest very
accurate measurements which resolved major discrepancies between theory and experiment
in favor of theory.

The most precise value of β, β = 27.024(43)(67)a3

0, was obtained in Ref. [1] from the
measurements of the ratio M1hf s/β where M1hf s is the M1 transition amplitude between
the states 6S and 7S induced by the hyperﬁne structure (hfs) interaction. Semiempirical
formula for the M1hf s amplitude derived in Refs. [5–7] was used in the analysis:

M1hf s = −(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Here A6s and A7s are the hfs constants of the 6s and 7s states of Cs, gS = 2.0025, gI =
−0.0004, the coeﬃcient 1.0024 was introduced to account for the many-body eﬀects. This
gives M1hf s = | µB
0 and kP N C = 0.9065(36)iea0 and measurements of (1) [2]
lead to the value of the weak charge of 133Cs QW = −72.06(28)(34) which diﬀers from the
prediction of the Standard Model QW = −73.20(13) [8] by 2.5σ.
From the point of view of accurate atomic calculations, there are two major questions in
the analysis above which should be considered. The ﬁrst is whether the actual accuracy of
the PNC calculations is really 0.4%. The second is whether the semi-empirical formula (2)
is accurate. In the present paper we address the second question, leaving the ﬁrst one for
later work.

II. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS

M1hf s amplitude appears due to mixing of the 6s and 7s states by the hfs interaction,

M1hf s = h6s, F|Hhf s|7s, Fi

E6s − E7s

h7s, F|M1|7s, F ′i
+ h6s, F|M1|6s, F ′ih6s, F ′|Hhf s|7s, F ′i

E7s − E6s

.

(3)

Two major assumptions have been made to arrive at (2) from (3). First, the non-relativistic
expression for the operator of the M1 transition was used:

M1 = −|µB|g(L + 2S).
Second, the square root formula is assumed to be valid

h6s|Hhf s|7si = qh6s|Hhf s|6sih7s|Hhf s|7si.

(4)

(5)

The accuracy of both of these assumptions needs to be examined. The situation is clear with
the relativistic corrections to the M1 operator (4). According to the estimations of Bouchiat
and Piketty [6] the relativistic eﬀects modify the amplitudes h6s|M1|6si and h7s|M1|7si at
only the 10−4 level. This is in line with the many-body calculations of the relativistic eﬀects
in g-factors and M1-transition amplitudes for Cs and other alkaline atoms in our early works
[9,10].

The situation with the square root formula (5) is less clear. In their pioneering work
Bouchiat and Piketty [6] estimated the ﬁrst order core polarization corrections to it and
introduced the correction factor 1.0017. In a later paper by Bouchiat and Gu´ena [7] this
factor was assumed to be 1.0024 (see also formula (2)). The accuracy of the estimation of
the many body correction was assumed to be approximately equal to the correction itself
(∼ 0.002) [6,7].
In these works there were no accurate calculations of other many body
contributions to the hfs beyond the ﬁrst order core polarization corrections. However, it is
known that these contributions can be up to 20% of the hyperﬁne structure (see below).
The applicability of eq. (2) in this situation is not obvious.

The accurate relativistic many-body calculations of the oﬀ-diagonal hfs matrix element
(5) were recently performed by the Notre Dame group [11]. The accuracy of the calculations
was about 1% and agreement with formula (5) within this accuracy was achieved. Note that
the theoretical accuracy for the diagonal hfs matrix elements is also about 1% (see Refs.
[12,13] and this article). This accuracy is not suﬃcient to ﬁnd an accurate value of β to add
anything new to the result of the cesium PNC experiment published in [2].

However, we believe that the validity of the square root formula (5) can be demonstrated
to much higher accuracy than the absolute theoretical accuracy of the hfs calculations (here
we agree with [5–7]). We suggest that the following combination of matrix elements be
calculated

R =

h6s|Hhf s|7si

qh6s|Hhf s|6sih7s|Hhf s|7si

− 1,

(6)

3

where all hfs matrix elements are calculated in the same approximation. The value of R
can be calculated with very high accuracy because uncertainties in diﬀerent matrix elements
cancel each other almost exactly. We will demonstrate that inclusion of diﬀerent many body
and relativistic eﬀects leave the formula

h6s|Hhf s|7si = qh6s|Hhf s|6sih7s|Hhf s|7si

(7)

valid to very high accuracy, so that the value of R (6) remains very small.

Let us start from the analytical estimates of diﬀerent contributions to R in (6). First
note that in the single-electron approximation formula (7) is exact if the wave functions of
the 6s and 7s states are proportional

ψ6s = Bψ7s

(8)

(a0 is Bohr radius) on short distances from the nucleus, r ≤ a0/Z. Dirac equations for the
states 6s and 7s diﬀer by the energy only. Therefore, their solutions on short distances
where the diﬀerence in energies is small compared to the potential, diﬀer by normalization
only. One can say that (8) is valid if

∆E/|V | ≪ 1,

(9)

where ∆E = 0.08445 a.u.
is the energy diﬀerence between the 6s and 7s states of Cs,
V is the atomic potential. The Hamiltonian of the hfs interaction Hhf s is proportional to
1/r3 and the main contribution to its matrix elements comes from the distances r ≤ a0/Z.
Substitution of V = Ze2/r, r = a0/Z and Z = 55 into (9) gives

∆E
V ≈ 3 × 10−5.

(10)

Note that for s-waves the correction can be even smaller.
Indeed, in the non-relativistic
approximation s-wave hfs is proportional to δ(r). Thus, the typical distances r ∼ ¯h/(mec) =
αa0, where α = 1/137.
Let us now consider the many-body eﬀects. It is convenient to do this using the many
body perturbation theory in the residual Coulomb interaction U, U = H − HHF . Here H is
the exact Hamiltonian of the atom and HHF is the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian. We generate
the complete zero-approximation set of the eigenvalues, wave functions and Green’s functions
using the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian. The small parameter of this many-body perturbation
theory is the ratio of the non-diagonal matrix element of the residual interaction U to
the large energy denominator for excitation of the electron from the closed electron shell
(electron core), e.g. 5p -electron: U/E5p ∼ 10−2.
The perturbative (correlation) corrections to the hfs matrix element can be divided into
two classes: the self-energy corrections and the vertex corrections. The former can be
included into eq. (6) through the redeﬁnition of the single electron wave functions while the
latter are included through the redeﬁnition of the Hhf s operator.

Self-energy corrections dominate in the hfs of alkaline atoms (see, e.g. [14]). The major
contribution is due to the correlations between an external electron and core electrons. We
include them by using so called Brueckner orbitals instead of the Hartree-Fock orbitals as the
single-electron wave functions in eq. (6). The Brueckner orbitals are obtained by introducing

4

an additional operator ˆΣ into the Hartree-Fock equations for the external electron and
solving the Dyson-type equation (HHF + ˆΣ(E) − E)ψ = 0. The ˆΣ is an energy-dependent
non-local operator which is also called the “correlation potential” [12,15]. For the calculation
of ˆΣ see the next section. The Brueckner type correlation correction constitutes 20% of the
hfs of 6s and 7s states of Cs. However, if we neglect the dependence of ˆΣ on energy,
It follows from the calculations that ∂ ˆΣ/∂E ∼ 1% for
the estimation (10) is still valid.
E ∼ E6s, E7s (it is suppressed by the parameter ∆E/E5p). This leaves condition (10)
practically unchanged.
Dominating vertex corrections to the hfs matrix element are due to the eﬀect of core po-
larization by the nuclear dipole magnetic ﬁeld. Since the core states change in the magnetic
ﬁeld, the Hartree-Fock potential V created by the core electrons as well as the correlation
potential ˆΣ also change. The eﬀect of this change on the hfs can be accounted for by
redeﬁning the operator of the hfs interaction [12]:

H′hf s = Hhf s + δV + δ ˆΣ.

(11)

The correction to the hfs caused by δV is often called the RPA-type [16] correction, while an-
other correction associated with δ ˆΣ is the non-Brueckner correlation correction or structural
radiation [15]. These corrections are more likely to cause deviation from the square root
formula since they are localized on larger distances up to the core radius. Note, however,
that in the case of the hfs interaction δV is completely due to the Hartree-Fock exchange
potential. There is no change to the Hartree-Fock direct potential since magnetic ﬁeld does
not change electron density in the ﬁrst order of perturbation theory. This means that δV
vanishes exponentially outside the core. Inside the core, at r ∼ a0 , ∆E/V ∼ 0.01 and the
6s and 7s orbitals are still proportional. Note that the potential V at these distances may
be estimated as V ∼ −Zef f e2/r, where Zef f ∼ 5. Since the contribution of δV is about 10%
we come to the estimate 10−3 for the error of the square root formula.
There is one more reason why the square root formula is accurate. The expression for
R (6) is symmetric with respect to the energies E6s and E7s. Therefore, its decomposition
over ∆E (∆E = E6s − E7s) starts from ∆E 2:

R = a(∆E)2 + b(∆E)4 + . . . .

(12)

Since all linear in ∆E terms are canceled out one can say that the error should be smaller
than in the estimates above. The dimensionless parameter for (12) is

(∆E/E5p)2 ∼ 10−2,

where E5p ≈ 0.84 a.u. is the core excitation energy. Since the term a(∆E)2 arises due to δV
and δ ˆΣ which contribute about 10% and 1%, respectively, into the hfs, the total deviation
from the square root formula caused by the RPA and non-Brueckner corrections should be
smaller than 10−1×10−2 = 10−3. We may add that the contribution of δ ˆΣ to the hfs is much
smaller than the contribution of ˆΣ since δ ˆΣ has an additional suppression by the parameter
(∆E/E5p) [15].

There are also contributions to the self-energy and vertex due to the radiative corrections.
We have not considered these contributions in our calculations. However, they come from

5

the very short distances r ≤ ¯h/mec = αa0 and should not cause any signiﬁcant deviation
from the square root formula.
Finally, let us estimate contributions to M1hf s which cannot be presented in the form of
eq. (3). Let us use the basis of the exact atomic eigenstates and treat Hhf s as a perturbation
in this basis. The result can be presented in the form

M1hf s = X
+ X

E6s − Eα

hf6s, F|Hhf s|α, Fi
hα, F|M1|f7s, F ′i
β hf6s, F|M1|β, F ′ihβ, F ′|Hhf s|f7s, F ′i

Eβ − E7s

.

(13)

Here |f6si,|f7si,|αi,|βi are the eigenstates which include all possible conﬁguration mixing,
|αi and |βi may contain an arbitrary number of pairs of excited electrons and holes in
the electron core. All non-diagonal matrix elements of the M1 operator vanish in the
non-relativistic limit. Moreover, it was demonstrated in our work [9] that the dominant
contribution appears only in the second order in the spin-orbit interaction and in the
ﬁrst order in conﬁguration mixing, i.e. non-diagonal M1 matrix elements are of the or-
der M1 ∼ (Zα)4Qin/E ∼ 10−4 − 10−5|µB|, where Qin is the non-diagonal matrix ele-
ment of the Coulomb interaction corresponding to an excitation of a core electron and
E is the energy of this excitation.
Indeed, the operator of the magnetic moment is
M1 = µB(L + 2S) = µB(2J − L) (relativistic correction to this expression ∼ 10−5). Elec-
tron wave functions are the eigenfunctions of the total electron angular momentum J. There-
fore, J does not give any non-diagonal matrix elements. On the other hand, the matrix ele-
ment hα, J = 1/2|L|β, J = 1/2i requires spin-orbit interaction both in the bra hα, J = 1/2|
and ket |β, J = 1/2i vectors, since in the non-relativistic limit they correspond to the total
orbital angular momentum L = 0, i.e. L|αi = L|βi = 0. Thus, we need the second order in
spin-orbit interaction. Note that the non-diagonal in angular momentum L matrix elements
of the hyperﬁne interaction like h˜s1/2|Hhf s| ˜d3/2i do not help since in this case both the hfs
matrix element and M1 matrix element h˜s1/2|M1| ˜d3/2i are very small.

Therefore, we may safely assume that the correction to the diagonal M1 contribution (3)
does not exceed 10−3.

[9,10];

We should note that it may not be easy to come to this conclusion using perturbation
theory in the Dirac basis of electron orbitals (jj scheme) (Dirac basis was used in Ref. [6]).
In this basis the small result must appear due to strong cancellations between diﬀerent terms
in the sum over intermediate states.

III. MANY-BODY CALCULATIONS

To test the validity of the square root formula (7) we performed accurate many-body
relativistic calculations of the oﬀ-diagonal and diagonal hfs matrix elements. Detailed dis-
cussion of the accurate hfs calculations can be found elsewhere [12]. Here we repeat the
main points emphasizing the role of diﬀerent many-body eﬀects.

6

We start calculations from the relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) method in the V N−1 ap-
proximation (calculations for the external electron are carried out in the frozen self-consistent
ﬁeld of the core ). The core polarization is calculated using the Hartree-Fock equations in
an external ﬁeld [14]. It is equivalent to the well-known random-phase approximation with
exchange method (see, e.g. [16]). The many-body eﬀects such as the Brueckner-type cor-
relations, and the structural radiation are included by means of the correlation potential
method [15]. As it was pointed out in the previous section, the Brueckner-type correlation
corrections are included by solving the Dyson-type equation for the states of the external
electron

(HHF + ˆΣ − E)ψ = 0.

(14)

Correlation potential ˆΣ accounts for the correlation between an external electron and core
electrons. We use many body perturbation theory and the Feynman diagram technique
to calculate ˆΣ [12,19]. The perturbation expansion of ˆΣ in the residual Coulomb interac-
tion starts from the second order. The corresponding diagrams are presented on Fig. 1.
We include both the second order diagrams and three dominating classes of higher order
correlations:

1. Screening of the Coulomb interaction between an external electron and core electrons
by other core electrons. This is a collective phenomenon and the corresponding chain
of diagrams is enhanced by a factor approximately equal to the number of electrons
in the external closed subshell (the 5p electrons on Cs). We stress that our approach
takes into account screening diagrams with double, triple and higher core electron
excitations in contrast to the popular coupled cluster method where only double and
selected triple excitations are considered (see, e.g. [13]). The eﬀect of screening is
taken into account in all orders by summation of the corresponding chain of diagrams
which in the Feynman digram technique form a matrix geometrical progression.

2. Hole-particle interaction in the core polarization operator. This eﬀect is enhanced
by the large zero-multipolarity diagonal matrix elements of the Coulomb interaction.
We take it into account by amending the direct Hartree-Fock potential in which the
polarization operator is calculated.

3. Iterations of the self-energy operator ( ˆΣ). This chain of diagrams describes the non-
linear eﬀects of the correlation potential and is enhanced by the small denominator,
which is the excitation energy of an external electron (in comparison with the excita-
tion energy of a core electron). The iterations of ˆΣ are included by solving equation
(14).

Substituting the Brueckner orbitals into eq. (6) accounts for the dominating correlation
corrections to the hfs. Corresponding diagrams are presented on Fig. 2. These corrections
constitutes 23% of the hfs of the 6s state of Cs and 12% of the hfs of the 7s state of Cs.

To take into account the core polarization eﬀect we self-consistently solve the Hartree-
Fock equation for the core states in the nuclear magnetic ﬁeld. The details are presented in
Ref. [14]. When all corrections δψn to core states caused by the magnetic ﬁeld are found,
they are used to calculate the correction δV to the Hartree-Fock potential. Then core

7

polarization is included into the single-electron matrix element ha|Hhf s|bi between valence
states |ai and |bi by redeﬁning the operator of the hfs interaction H′hf s = Hhf s + δV . This
corresponds to the summation of the inﬁnite series of the RPA-type of diagrams presented
on Fig. 3. The RPA-type core polarization contribution to the hfs of the 6s and 7s states
of Cs is about 15%.

Core polarization also leads to the change of ˆΣ. Corresponding contributions to the hfs
matrix element ha|δ ˆΣ|bi are often called structural radiation. Second order diagrams for
structure radiation are presented on Fig. 4. We use direct summation over the complete set
of single-electron states to calculate these diagrams.

There is also a contribution to the hfs due to the change of normalization of the wave

function caused by ˆΣ. This contribution can be written in a form

Anorm =

1
2ha|Hhf s|bi(ha|∂ ˆΣ/∂E|ai + hb|∂ ˆΣ/∂E|bi).

(15)

The combined contribution of the structural radiation and renormalization into the hfs of
the 6s and 7s states of Cs are 1.5% and 0.6% respectively.

When all dominating higher-order correlations are included into the calculation of the
Brueckner orbitals for the 6s and 7s states of cesium, the accuracy for the calculated energies
of these states is very high and constitutes about 0.1%. However, we introduced ﬁtting
parameters to re-scale ˆΣ to ﬁt the energies exactly. This procedure allows us to eﬀectively
include some omitted higher order correlations and to test the sensitivity of the hfs matrix
elements on the value of ˆΣ.

The results for the hfs are presented in Table I.

In this table h ≡ Hhf s, the matrix
elements of δV are RPA-type corrections, the matrix elements of δ ˆΣ are structural radiation
(including renormalization (15)), matrix elements with ψBr include Brueckner-type corre-
lation corrections. One can see that the correction to the square root formula due to the
considered many-body eﬀects does not exceed 4.4 × 10−4. When all dominating many-body
eﬀects are taken into account the accuracy of the calculated hfs constants compared to ex-
periment is about 1%. However the square root formula is still valid to the accuracy of about
10−4. The most likely cause of the remaining discrepancy with experiment is higher-order
correlation corrections not included in our calculations. These corrections are localized on
the radius of the core and due to the fact that these corrections are very small (∼ 1% of
the experimental hfs) it is extremely unlikely that they can break the square root formula.
The same may be said about the very small radiative and Breit corrections. Note that our
ﬁnal results for the diagonal hfs matrix elements for the 6s and 7s states are in very good
agreement with the calculations of the Notre-Dame group [13].

It follows from the above that the correction to the square root formula is about an
order of magnitude smaller than the estimations of Bouchiat and Gu´ena [7]. However,
there is no formal disagreement between the results, since Bouchiat and Gu´ena estimated
the uncertainty of their result to be equal to the correction itself. We believe that for the
analysis of the PNC experiment it is safer to assume no correction to the square root formula.
This slightly changes the numbers. The M1hf s amplitude, tensor polarizability β and weak
charge of the 133Cs nucleus become

M1hf s = |

µB
c |0.8074(8) × 10−5,

8

β = 26.957(43)(27)a3
0,
QW = −71.88(28)(29).

(16)

To stress the importance of the result here we used an estimate of the theoretical accuracy
0.4% [1] in the value of kP N C. Our result for M1hf s is in very good agreement with the
result of Derevianko et al [11]

M1hf s = |

µB
c |0.8070(73) × 10−5,

(17)

but has the better accuracy. The weak nuclear charge QW in (16) represents even larger
deviation from the Standard Model value QW = −73.20(13) [8] than the result presented
by Bennett and Wieman [1]. The deviation is 2.9σ if 0.4% accuracy of calculations of the
kP N C is assumed. Note that even if 1% accuracy is assumed for the calculated value of
kP N C as it was claimed in both theoretical works [3,4] then there is still 1.5σ deviation from
the Standard Model. However, we would like to stress once more that before making any
conclusions about agreement or disagreement with the Standard Model the question about
the accuracy of the atomic calculations of the PNC electronic matrix element kP N C (see (1))
should be carefully re-analyzed.

FIG. 1. Second-order diagrams for the self-energy of the valence electron ( ˆΣ operator). Dashed
line is the Coulomb interaction between core and valence electrons. Loop is the polarization of the
atomic core which corresponds to the virtual creation of the excited electron and a hole in the core
shells.

FIG. 2. Bruckner-type correlation diagrams for the hfs. Cross denotes the hfs interaction. The
Σ operator includes second-order diagrams (Fig.1) and higher-order diagrams as described in the
text.

FIG. 3. Core polarization (RPA) diagrams for the hfs in the ﬁrst and second order in Coulomb

interaction.

The generation of high harmonics in laser-irradiated light homonuclear diatomics (H +
2 , N2
and O2) compared to that in atomic counterparts (of nearly identical binding energy) is stud-
ied within the velocity gauge version of conventional strong-ﬁeld approximation. The applied
strong-ﬁeld approach (alternatively developed earlier to incorporate rescattering eﬀects be-
yond the conventional saddle-point approximation) is currently extended to molecular case by
means of supplement the standard linear combination of atomic orbitals and molecular orbitals
method. The associated model proved to adequately reproduce a general shape and detailed
structure of molecular harmonic spectra, which demonstrate a number of remarkable distinctive
diﬀerences from respective atomic spectra calculated under the same laser pulses. The revealed
diﬀerences are found to be strongly dependent on internuclear separation and also very sensitive
to the orbital and bonding symmetry of contributing molecular valence shell. In particular, the
model correctly predicts the behavior of high-frequency plateau (both for its extent and even
details of structure) in molecular harmonic spectra at small (nearly equilibrium) and large in-
ternuclear separations. In addition, for some group of harmonics, the harmonic emission rates
were ascertained to dominate by contribution from inner molecular shells of higher binding
energy and diﬀerent orbital symmetry compared to the outermost molecular orbital normally
predominantly contributing.

1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND MOTIVATION.

Apart from pure fundamental interest, the strong-ﬁeld phenomenon of high-order
harmonic generation (HHG) in laser-irradiated species is currently believed to be a highly
promising for creation compact (table-top) sources of ultra-short (sub-femtosecond) pulses
of powerful coherent XUV radiation [1, 2]. Being accessible, such a high-frequency radia-
tion might be used for X-ray holography or monitoring of biological processes in vivo [2]
as well as tomographic imaging of molecular orbitals [3] with an unprecedented brightness
and spatial and temporal resolution. For the reasons above, the HHG process became
a subject of equally great experimental and theoretical interest in the last decade (see
also e.g., [4-6], for review and references cited therein). Compared to atoms, the laser-
irradiated molecules as sources of high harmonics [7-14] oﬀer promising prospects as to
raising the up to now disappointingly low conversion eﬃciency for harmonic generation
[7-12] and/or harmonic cutoﬀ frequency [10, 13] due to an advanced possibility of con-
trolling and manipulating the additional external degrees of freedom in molecules. For
example, the internuclear distance R0 of simplest diatomic molecules, which determines
diﬀerently delocalized initial electronic states, can be used to enhance the harmonic con-
version eﬃciency exceeding the atomic one due to transient enhancement of harmonic
emission in expanding molecules [12]. Particularly, the calculated harmonic conversion
eﬃciency was found to be noticeably enhanced (by several orders of magnitude) with
increasing of R0 over equilibrium internuclear separation [10, 12, 14]. Diatomic molecules
may also produce high harmonics of much higher cutoﬀ frequency due to a much longer
high-frequency plateau extended up to 8Up of maximum length [10] versus the respective
maximum value 3.17Up ascertained for atomic harmonic spectra (here Upis the pondero-
motive energy of ﬁeld-induced oscillating motion of an electron in the continuum; the
atomic system of units is used unless stated otherwise).

Because of the electron wavelength is comparable to the size of the molecular wave-
function, the intensity of emission at a particular X-ray photon energy is also expected
to be sensitive to the wavelength of the electron wave and the shape of the molecular
wavefunction and/or orientation of internuclear molecular axis with respect to incident
laser ﬁeld polarization [8-11]. In addition, simultaneous observation of both ion yields and
harmonic signals [15] under the same conditions was shown to serve as an eﬀective tool

to probe molecular structure in an instant [16] and also make it possible to use quantum
phenomena in HHG associated with molecular symmetries to disentangle the contribu-
tions from the ionization and recombination processes [17]. In this context, homonuclear
(or homopolar) diatomics seem to be also of special interest due to identical atomic
nuclei give rise to a possibility of various laser ﬁeld-induced and orientation-dependent
intramolecular interference eﬀects [15] that may additionally aﬀect the molecular HHG
process. The clear signs of intramolecular interference-related eﬀects due to two-centered
nature of diatomic molecule were numerically revealed [11] in high-harmonic spectra of
model (1D or 2D) H +
2 and H2 systems as a broad and pronounced local minimum of
the position strongly dependent on the internuclear separation and spatial orientation of
diatomic molecule. The origin of the minimum was attributed to the destructive interfer-
ence of photoelectron emission from separate atomic centers [11], so that a transparent
interpretation can be given in terms of interference between two radiating point sources
located at the positions of the nuclei. The latter pivotal idea (obviously proposed ﬁrst
in Ref. [18]) about intramolecular interference of atomic photoionization amplitudes was
successfully exploited in [19] for description of molecular ionization as compared to ion-
ization of respective atomic counterparts having nearly identical binding energies. Based
on the velocity gauge formulation of conventional strong-ﬁeld approximation (SFA) (see,
[20] and associated Keldysh-Faisal-Reiss theories [21]) with the atomic ionization
e.g.
rates modiﬁed by the interference from the atomic centers, the molecular ionization was
predicted to be enhanced (or, at least, not suppressed) in N2 (versus Ar) and/or sup-
pressed in O2 (versus Xe ). The mentioned suppression in O2 was interpreted in terms of
the strong-ﬁeld MO-SFA model [19] as intimately related to intramolecular interference,
which is to be always destructive for low-energy photoelectrons emitted from the 1πg
highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of antibonding symmetry and predominantly
contributing to respective ionization rate. Accordingly, the background physical mecha-
nism underlying an enhanced ionization in N2 versus Ar was identiﬁed as constructive
intramolecular interference for low-energy photoelectrons emitted from the 3σg HOMO
in N2 of bonding symmetry.

Meantime, because of the high suppression in strong-ﬁeld ionization of O2 versus
Xe, the laser-irradiated diatomic O2 is expected to produce high harmonics of notice-
ably higher cutoﬀ frequency as compared to Xe atom [13]. Namely, due to a suppressed
molecular ionization in H2 and O2 (versus their atomic counterparts) and correspond-
ingly larger value of the saturation intensity, the latter diatomics survive at a consid-
erably higher laser intensity (at which their atomic counterparts are to be completely
ionized) and, thus, they are still able to produce harmonics of a considerably higher cut-
oﬀ frequency (proportional to laser intensity). The related extension of high-frequency
plateau in harmonic spectra of O2 relative to Xe, was recently observed in experiment
and numerically simulated [13] based on the Lewenstein model [22] supplemented by the
molecular tunneling ionization (or the so-called MO-ADK) theory [23] to account for the
diﬀerences in ionization of molecules compared to atoms in terms of Ammosov-Delone-
Krainov (ADK) model of tunneling ionization [24]. The MO-ADK model partly succeeded
in reproducing of suppressed ionization (e.g., in O2 versus Xe compatible with experiment
[25]), although, being applied to molecular HHG, the model seems to encounter diﬃculties
in providing a transparent interpretation and satisfactory agreement with experiment in
prediction of the cutoﬀ frequency observed in molecular high-harmonic spectra [13] (see
also Sec.4 below, for details). Being also applied to ionization of other diatomic species
(e.g., in H2 versus companion Ar atom), the ADK-based approach resulted in a dis-

2

crepancy with experiment [26], at least in the strong-ﬁeld domain (i.e., only where the
tunneling theory is generally valid). Since the wavefunction of initial molecular state cor-
responding to HOMO is always approximated by only a single one-centered atomic orbital
within the MO-ADK model, such theory is not suitable either for adequate description
of intramolecular interference-related phenomena arising from the two-centered nature of
molecular valence shell in diatomics.

Thus, there are numerous interrelated and remarkable aspects of molecular HHG
and above-threshold ionization (ATI) as a prerequisite to the HHG, which appear to be
also strongly interdependent and interrelated in laser-irradiated molecules too. However,
with the possible few exceptions, the fundamental physics associated with how atoms and
molecules respond to intense laser radiation (i.e. optical ﬁelds approaching the atomic
unit) cannot be treated exactly due to the comparable strengths of the electron-nucleus,
electron-electron and electron-ﬁeld interaction. Although ab initio quantum calculations
for atoms are readily available, at least within the single-active electron (SAE) approxima-
tion, this is not the case for molecules as fully three-dimensional (3D) calculations on even
relatively simple diatomics, such as H +
2 , are extremely diﬃcult [14]. Therefore, the HHG
process in diatomic molecules is primarily treated nowadays using approximate SAE-
based general strong-ﬁeld approaches, such as conventional strong-ﬁeld approximation
(SFA) formulated in terms of ”rescattering” (or recollision) picture and model zero-range
binding potential of atomic centers [10] and/or various pure numerical procedures (see e.g.
[27]) and simulations (e.g., [8, 11, 12]). The harmonic emission rates for molecules can be
also calculated, in principle, based on diﬀerent ab initio numerical procedures and meth-
ods, such as direct numerical solution of time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE
method, e.g., [11]) and time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) including
many-electron eﬀects [28]; however, the related results seem to be very computationally
demanding and hardly available for reliable and transparent interpretation.

All the aspects above gave us a strong motivation to consider the harmonic genera-
tion in laser-irradiated diatomics and verify the mentioned aspects within the currently
proposed alternative model of molecular HHG. The model is based on fully quantum-
mechanical SAE-based strong-ﬁeld approach developed earlier [29, 30] and proved to ad-
equately incorporate rescattering eﬀects in atomic HHG and high-energy ATI processes.
In the present paper the proposed strong-ﬁeld approach is extended to molecular case
of diatomic specie (i.e.
substantially many-electron system) by means of supplement
the standard linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) and molecular orbitals (MO)
method invoked for approximate reproducing the two-centered one-electron wavefunction
of initial molecular discrete state. The LCAO-MO method proved to be surprisingly
well working for adequate description and transparent interpretation the phenomena of
enhanced (and/or suppressed) ionization of laser-irradiated diatomics in terms of pre-
viously developed strong-ﬁeld SFA-LCAO model [31]. This model is to be also used
further in Sec.3 for numerical calculation and evaluation of laser intensity for ionization
saturation under conditions of molecular HHG experiment [13]. The related results for
calculated harmonic emission rates (or high-harmonic conversion eﬃciency) and position
of high-frequency plateau cutoﬀ proved to be sensitive to the molecular orbital symmetry
and internuclear separation. At last, our present consideration is not restricted to only
one, a single (the outermost) molecular valence shell, so that other (inner) contributing
molecular orbitals of higher binding energies and diﬀerent orbital symmetry are addition-
ally and equally well incorporated, wherever appropriate. The proposed molecular HHG
model is shown to adequately reproduce the distinctive features of molecular harmonic

spectra compared to respective atomic spectra as well as noticeable diﬀerences found in
structure of molecular harmonic spectra corresponding to HOMO of bonding symmetry
(e.g., 3σg in N2) relative to antibonding symmetry (e.g., 1πg in O2).

2. THE APPLIED STRONG-FIELD HHG MODEL: BASIC ASSUMPTIONS AND ANA-

LYTICAL RELATIONS.

The harmonic emission process under discussion is to be further investigated within
framework of the strong-ﬁeld fully quantum-mechanical approach developed in [29, 30]
and applied previously to treatment of atomic HHG process. Let’s outline ﬁrst in brief the
main features of related strong-ﬁeld model, which is currently to be extended to molecular
case. Within the dipole approximation (neglecting any photon momenta) the Hamiltonian
of EM interaction in the velocity gauge (VG) form, reads as

is the operator of electron canonical momentum, c0 ≈
where
137 is the light
velocity in vacuum. This means that the vector potential A(t) of incident laser ﬁeld and
associated ﬁeld strength E(t) are supposed to be independent on coordinate r, but both
are functions of time t only. Our present consideration will be restricted entirely to the
case of only harmonic emission processes in which the atomic or molecular specie occupies
the same state before and after the passage of the laser pulse. Thus, the bound discrete
state is supposed to be unperturbed by incident laser ﬁeld and the respective undis-
torted (laser-free) stationary wavefunction Φ0 (r, t) = Φ0 (r) exp (
iε0t) already known in

advance (or, at least, found to any arbitrary prescribed accuracy).

Then, for particular case of linearly polarized laser ﬁeld of the frequency ω, electric

In a pulsed laser ﬁeld of arbitrary duration τ , the total yield of photoelectrons (i.e.,
the produced photoelectron and/or ion signal that is measured in experiment) depends
on the peak ﬁeld strength E0 and laser’s spatial and temporal proﬁles. For spatially
homogeneous incident laser ﬁeld, the amplitude E of laser ﬁeld is only dependent on the
peak ﬁeld strength E0 and temporal proﬁle function g (t) according to:

E (t) = eE (t) sin (ωt) = eE0g (t) sin (ωt)

So, for example, for Gaussian shape of laser pulse intensity:

with t0 = τ /2 as the time moment at which the laser intensity reaches a maximum during

is generally a considerably faster than the time period of essential change of temporal
proﬁle function g (t), the ionization rate (13) derived assuming time-independent laser
ﬁeld intensity can be approximately considered as still valid, but corresponding to the
instant ionization rate. This means that the ionization rate (13) is just supposed to be
adiabatically changing with variation of laser intensity through the laser pulse action and
the total ionization probability for the overall time of laser pulse duration τ can be found
according to the quasistatic formula:

3. SAE-EXTENSION TO MOLECULAR HHG IN DIATOMIC MOLECULES: THE MOLEC-

ULAR ORBITALS IN COORDINATE AND MOMENTUM SPACE.

So far, up to this point, we didn’t specify the nature of laser-irradiated system, so
that all the relations above are supposed to be equally well applicable to arbitrary atomic
and/or molecular species provided the SAE consideration is valid to derive the Fourier
transform of a single-electron wavefunction of initial bound discrete state in a closed
analytical form. Thus, according to the HHG model currently extended to molecular
case of homonuclear diatomics, the speciﬁed properties of laser-irradiated system are
incorporated solely through the ionization potential I (n)
and Fourier transform (6) being
the wavefunction Fn (p; R0) of initial n-th molecular discrete state in momentum space.
The corresponding single-electron wavefunctions, or molecular orbitals, each of a ﬁxed

p

0 =

of identical electrons, are
the mathematical constructs used to describe the multi-electron wavefunction in molecules
(similar to atomic orbitals in atom). According to the standard linear combination of
atomic orbitals (LCAO) and molecular orbitals (MO) method, the wavefunction of each
(n-th) molecular valence shell can be approximately considered as two-centered MO:

Because the highest-lying orbitals are responsible for chemical properties, they are of
particular interest. For N2 molecule and the 3σg HOMO of gerade and bonding symmetry
commonly considered, the approximate two-centered single-electron molecular wavefunc-
tion can be composed, for example, as a superposition of scaled hydrogen-like 2pz or 1s

generally chosen to adequately (although, approximately) reproduce the spatial distribu-
tion of electronic density in respective MO under consideration relative to the internuclear
axis. In particular, an appropriate choice of predominantly contributing AOs φ(n)
(r) al-
lows for approximate reproducing a considerable electron density (inherent to σ valence
shells) or negligibly small electron density (inherent to π valence shells) nearly along the
internuclear axis spatial region, irrespectively of bonding or antibonding symmetry. For
example, the 3σg HOMO in N2 is well-known as a considerably prolate along the inter-
nuclear axis, so that respective spatial distribution of molecular electron density can be
approximately reproduced by the linear combination (20) of two predominantly contribut-
ing 2pz hydrogen-like atomic orbitals, which are oriented along the internuclear molecular
axis (supposed to be coincident with spatial OZ axis). Accordingly, the 1πg HOMO in
O2 is well-known to have a negligible electron density along the internuclear axis and this
feature can be adequately reproduced by a single linear combination (23) of two predom-
inantly contributing 2px (or 2py) scaled hydrogen-like atomic orbitals, which are oriented
perpendicularly to the internuclear axis.

j

We have to mention here that the ”+” combination of 2pz scaled hydrogen-like atomic
orbitals we previously used in [31] to reproduce 3σg HOMO in N2 doesn’t provide the
even (gerade) spatial parity and bonding symmetry of the (2p) 3σg, although proved to be
a surprisingly well working in explaining of relevant experiment [26] (which, particularly,
shows no suppression found in strong-ﬁeld ionization of N2). Therefore, presently the ”
”
−
combination of 2pz states in Eq.(20) is used, which does provide the even spatial parity of
the (2p) 3σg HOMO. However, according to the MO-SFA model [19], such a composition
would result in destructive intramolecular interference and accordingly high suppression
in ionization of N2 (see also [31], for details). To eliminate the mentioned deﬁciency, in our
present consideration we apply a more accurate composition of the 3σg HOMO taking into
account some admixture of contribution from atomic s-states required mostly to provide
a good agreement with experiment (which doesn’t show a suppressed ionization in N2).
Thus, the 3σg MO is to be further approximated by the coherent superposition of few
diﬀerent MOs corresponding to separate contributions from atomic states of a speciﬁed
orbital symmetry (viz., the scaled hydrogen-like 1s, 2s and 2pz orbitals):

Φ(1s2s2p)3σg (r; R0) = A1sΦ(1s)3σg (r; R0) + A2sΦ(2s)3σg (r; R0) + A2pΦ(2p)3σg (r; R0)

(24)

with the weight coeﬃcients Aj (j = 1, 2, 3) being the relative contributions (
1)
|
from respective atomic states and considered as variational parameters to be found from
the equation for minimum of respective molecular binding energy, the value of which is
put to be equal to the experimental value. Unlike this, the 1πg HOMO in O2 is further
supposed to be reproduced by the single (2p) 1πg MO (24), which proved to be fairly
well working [31] in interpretation of a high suppression of strong-ﬁeld ionization found
in relevant experiment [25, 26].

Let’s note ﬁrst that the angular dependence of the (2p) 3σg molecular wavefunction
in momentum space (25) clearly indicates that a separate contribution from 2pz states
alone is highly resistant to ionization along the direction perpendicular to the internu-
clear molecular axis (cos (θp)
0). The respective angular dependence on the angle θp of
photoelectron emission relative to the internuclaer axis is well seen in Fig.1a to be a consid-
erably prolate along the internuclear axis. Thus, the photoelectron emission from (2p) 3σg
MO is profoundly dominated along the internuclear molecular axis (cos (θp)
1). similar
to observed earlier in [31] for incorrect (the ”+”) combination of two 2pz states. This,
particularly, illustrates that the spatial (gerade or ungerade) symmetry of the (2p) 3σg
MO doesn’t essentially aﬀect the angular dependence (viz., nodal plane along the molec-
ular axis) of respective Fourier transform. Owing to the presence of cos (θp) factor (see
” (currently used) and the ”+” (earlier used in [31]) combination
Eq.(25)), both the ”
of 2pz atomic states suggest a predominant photoelectron emission along the internuclear
axis (see also Fig.1a presented in [31], for comparison). The sign of the combination
mostly alters the absolute value of local maxima in respective Fourier transform due to
diﬀerent (sine or cosine) trigonometric factor arising due to intramolecular interference
of contributions of ionization from two atomic centers [19] separated by the internu-
clear distance R0. Since the generalized Bessel functions in Eqs.(10)-(11) are commonly
maximized when photoelectron momentum p is parallel to the laser polarization e, the

−

≈

9

ionization from (2p) 3σg HOMO composed as a single combination of 2pz states alone
is thus expected to be predominant when N2 molecular axis is aligned along the laser
e). The latter conclusion (also previously made in [31] for (2p) 3σg
ﬁeld polarization (R0||
HOMO of ungerade symmetry) seems to be natural and consistent with relevant experi-
ment [32] and earlier alternative VG-SFA calculation [19] (see Fig.7b presented therein)
using pure numerical self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) procedure of 3σgHOMO composi-
tion taking the contribution from atomic s-states into account. However, this statement
is in a contradiction to respective VG-SFA results of calculation [33] applying the same
VG-SFA approach and numerical HF-based procedure of 3σg composition as proposed
earlier in Ref.[19]. Contrary to [19], the strong-ﬁeld ionization of N2 was found in [33]
to be predominant for perpendicular orientation of internuclear axis relative to the laser
ﬁeld polarization.

A2p ≈

A2p ≈

A2s ≃ −

To clarify the reason of the contradiction, Figures 1b-1d demonstrate the angular
dependence of molecular wavefunction in momentum space calculated for possible diﬀer-
ent 3σg compositions (5), either with or without taking a comparable contribution from
atomic s-states into account. The relative (weight) coeﬃcients Aj at 1s , 2s and 2pz states
under consideration proved to have comparable values for 3σg composition presented in
1/√2 for
Fig.1, although not necessarily of the same signs. For example, A1s ≃ −
1/√3 for (1s2s2p) 3σg composition, so that
(1s2p) 3σg, whereas A1s ≃ −
the weight coeﬃcients at 1s and 2pz states (as well as 1s and 2s states) are found to have
always opposite signs. Moreover, only the combinations with A1s and A2p (as well as A1s
and A2s) of opposite signs proved to provide no suppression in N2 ionization revealed
in experiment [26]. To summarize, the presented Fourier transforms corresponding to
(1s2p) 3σg and/or (1s2s2p) 3σg valence shells clearly suggest a predominant photoelec-
tron emission from 3σg HOMO along the internuclear axis, contrary to suggested in [33].
Our Fig.1 also demonstrates that such diﬀerence may only arise owing to relative contri-
bution from s-states, which seems to be somehow overestimated (compared to p-states)
within the particular (12s7p)/[6s4p] basis chosen in [33] for numerical HF-based proce-
dure of 3σg composition in coordinate space (see also [34] for details). In the meantime,
a composition overestimating the relative contribution from s-states doesn’t seem to be
suitable to 3σg molecular state, which is known to have a more complex structure surely
dominated by p-states in coordinate space [17]. This also becomes especially evident ow-
ing to Fig.12 in Ref.[35] displaying the correct orbital shape for the 3σg wavefunction in
N2, which obviously contrasts with the resulting 3σg state of substantially diﬀerent shape
and detailed structure suggested in [33] (cf., for example, respective Fig.1c presented in
the last reference therein).

For laser-irradiated atomic counterparts of diatomics under consideration - such as
Ar (for N2 and/or H2) and Xe (for O2) with 3p and 5p outermost atomic valence shells,
respectively - the initial atomic ground state can be also approximately reproduced by
corresponding one-electron hydrogen-like atomic orbital. The analytical expression for
respective atomic Fourier transforms F (3px,3py)

(e.g., in Ar) corresponding to diﬀerent possible values of associated magnetic quantum

The proposed strong-ﬁeld model is also equally well suitable to describe molecular

Under the conditions of equivalent atomic centers and the atomic or molecular specie
occupies the same state before and after the passage of the laser pulse, only odd harmonics
of the fundamental laser frequency of linear polarization are emitted [29]. The harmonic
emission rates are to be currently calculated only for high-order harmonics of polarization
ek′,λ′, for which the emission rate becomes maximal, that is parallel to polarization e of
incident laser ﬁeld. The model-related background analytical expressions (3)-(12) and
(25)-(28) do imply fully 3D consideration of the process (particularly, they are available
for arbitrary orientation of internuclear molecular axis with respect to the laser polar-
ization e), nonetheless, the molecular axis is supposed further to be strongly aligned
along the polarization of incident laser ﬁeld (i.e. (e
cos (Θ) = 0 ) throughout
our present consideration, unless stated otherwise. The associated orientation eﬀects in
molecular harmonic generation are thus beyond the scope of our present consideration,
which is mostly focused on behavior of molecular harmonic spectra depending on equally
important problem parameters, such as internuclear separation R0 and properties of a
speciﬁed laser-irradiated diatomic (such as orbital symmetry, composition and structure
of molecular valence shells) as well as incident laser parameters (such as laser intensity,
pulse duration and temporal proﬁle).

4. CALCULATION, NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION.

When studying the strong-ﬁeld phenomena, the major diﬃculty with molecules is
to deal with both the electronic and the nuclear degrees of freedom (i.e., related to the
molecular vibrational and rotational motion). Nonetheless, the including of the nuclei
motion into a proper consideration is generally feasible within frame of the currently ap-
plied approach, but this additionally requires of preliminary knowing available reliable

11

data (previously calculated or measured in experiment) related to dependence of molec-
ular binding energy on internuclear separation R0. To the best of our knowledge, the
latter dependence is reliably known only for the simplest diatomics (H +
2 or H2), solely for
which the R0 -dependent behavior of molecular HHG can be numerically studied within
the currently proposed model. For all other diatomics under consideration (N2 and O2),
the nuclei motion will be further completely ignored and the Born-Oppenheimer approx-
imation is supposed to be valid. For this reason we start our numerical study from H +
2
molecular ion, which is suﬃciently well explored in previous theoretical and experimental
studies (see [36], for a review). Beginning from the ﬁrst HHG calculations [37, 38], this
molecular specie, owing to its structural simplicity, became the object of a large number
of other theoretical and experimental investigations (e.g., [8, 10-12]), the results of which
can be used for direct comparison.

calculated as harmonic
emission rates (13) compared to respective atomic counterparts of nearly identical binding
energy under conditions considered earlier in [10]. Like in [10], the results presented in
Fig.2a were calculated assuming R0-independent ﬁxed molecular binding energy ε0 (viz.,
= 0.4 a.u. for any internuclear separation R0), which is supposed to be identical to
ε0|
|
that of model atomic ”counterpart” bound to model zero-range potential (ZRP). Since
the molecular binding energy is known to be R0-dependent, Fig.2b also presents the
analogous high-harmonic spectra of H +
2 calculated under the same laser pulse and R0-
dependent molecular binding energy ε0 (R0) corresponding to initial 1σg ground state.
Also, unlike Fig.2a, the high-harmonic spectrum of respective atomic ”counterpart” was
calculated assuming the hydrogen-like 1S discrete state of atomic binding energy ε0 ≈
15.86 eV nearly identical to the molecular binding energy ε0 ≈ −
2 (1σg)
−
corresponding to R0 = 12 a.u. The molecular harmonic spectra presented in Fig.2 show
the clear signs of the so-called ”low-energy hump” similar to that revealed in [10] within a
low-frequency domain, which is enormously enhanced for two-centered case as compared
to the one-centered (”atomic”) case also presented in Fig.2. The origin of this ”hump”
arising in molecular high-harmonic spectra was well explained earlier [10] in terms of the
rescattering mechanism and, particularly, by the existence of two diﬀerent pathways for
the initially released electron to recombine: with the center it started from as well as
with the other. Namely, the ”hump” corresponds to the case when the initially released
electron moves directly from one center to the other within a time interval that is short
compared with the period of the ﬁeld, moreover, this happens around the time where the
ﬁeld is near its maximum. Under these conditions the energy gain, which the released
electron acquires from the driving laser ﬁeld when moving along the shortest way from
one atomic center to other, can be approximately evaluated just by εel ∼
ER0 that
ER0/ω of the ”hump”. According to
corresponds the position of the top harmonic Nh ≈
this quasiclassical interpretation, the position of its top harmonic should be noticeably
shifted toward a higher frequency part for a larger internuclear separation R0. This
particular behavior is fairly well reproduced in Fig.3 by other high-harmonic spectra of
H +
2 calculated for a diﬀerent incident laser pulse and various larger values of R0, for which
Fig.3 also shows the signs of ”split” arising within the ”low-energy hump”.

We also note the position of high-frequency plateau cutoﬀ calculated for relatively
large internuclear separation and presented in Figures 2 and 3 noticeably deviates from
what is prescribed by the well known rule ”Ip + 3.17Up” for standard harmonic cutoﬀ
frequency. So, according to this rule, one would expect for the position NC of the cutoﬀ
frequency to be nearly at the harmonic order NC ≈
49 in Fig.2b, that

43 in Fig.2a or NC ≈

12

is quite consistent with those ﬁgures suggest for atomic case. Meanwhile, the respective
molecular harmonic spectra calculated for R0 = 12 a.u. clearly demonstrate a noticeably
diﬀerent position for the cutoﬀ frequency, viz., at harmonic order NC ≈
51 in Fig.2a or
55 in Fig.2b. Moreover, there is also a pronounced and well-deﬁned ”cutoﬀ split”
NC ≈
visible within the plateau cutoﬀ domain of molecular harmonic spectra presented in Figs.2,
3. This ”cutoﬀ split” is similar to the split revealed earlier [10] in the cutoﬀ domain of
H +
2 high-harmonic spectra calculated for suﬃciently large internuclear separation R0.
The origin of the ”cutoﬀ split” can be also well explained in terms of the rescattering
mechanism and, particularly, attributed to the interference of two other (longest, but
topologically diﬀerent) pathways for the released electron moving from the one atomic
center to the other to recombine with (see, also [10], for details). The respective separation
in energy the released electron gains from the driving laser ﬁeld is about at the position
of high-frequency plateau cutoﬀ (viz., nearly around the mentioned above harmonic order
N = 47 in Fig.2a and/or N = 51 in Fig.2b), so that the two maxima alongside completely
mask the actual cutoﬀ position as the distance R0 increases.

As noted above, unlike the atomic case, the cutoﬀ position NC in calculated molecular
harmonic spectra proved to be not ﬁxed yet even for the ﬁxed parameters of incident laser
pulse, but also substantially dependent on internuclear separation. Such R0-dependent
behavior of NC (R0) is well illustrated by Fig.3, which represents H +
2 harmonic spectra
calculated for diﬀerent ﬁxed values of R0 under the same laser pulse. In particular, Fig.3
demonstrates the deviation of the harmonic cutoﬀ position from the well known rule
”Ip + 3.17Up”, even if the corresponding decrease of molecular ionization potential Ip for
larger R0 is taken into complete account. So, in Fig.3a the position of high-frequency
cutoﬀ for relatively small R0 = 4 a.u. is in a full accordance with the aforementioned
rule for standard cutoﬀ corresponding to the harmonic order NC ≈
73. This value is
accordingly and noticeably smaller compared to NC ≈
80 prescribed for larger ioniza-
tion potential Ip = 30.0 eV corresponding to the equilibrium internuclear separation
R0 = 2 a.u. Thus, the calculated position of harmonic cutoﬀ initially moves toward a
lower frequency domain of spectrum due to corresponding decrease of molecular ioniza-
tion potential Ip as R0 increases. However, under further expansion and corresponding
decrease of molecular ionization potential, the cutoﬀ frequency is, nevertheless, getting to
move back toward a higher frequency domain, contrary to the ”standard cutoﬀ” rule. So,
for example, in molecular harmonic spectra calculated for larger internuclear separation
and presented in Fig.3a, one can identify the cutoﬀ position located at harmonic order
NC (R0 = 15 a.u.)
89 respectively. These two values are
noticeably larger than NC ≈
70 prescribed by the mentioned ”standard cutoﬀ” rule based
on correspondingly decreased molecular ionization potential in H +
2 taken into account.
The physical mechanism underlying this quite an opposite tendency of increasing the har-
monic cutoﬀ frequency for suﬃciently large R0 increased can be again well understood in
terms of semiclassical ”recollision” picture invoked above for interpretation of the ”cutoﬀ
split”. Namely, when R0 increases, the released electron acquires an additional energy
gain from the driving laser ﬁeld when moving along the longer ways from one atomic cen-
ter to other. Due to the mentioned additional energy gain followed by recombination the
acquired electron energy is released as a photon of a considerably higher frequency that
gives rise to increasing of the harmonic cutoﬀ frequency. Beginning from suﬃciently large
internuclear separation (over about R0 = 10 a.u.), this mechanism becomes predominant,
insomuch that the related additional energy gain can compensate or even overcome the
competing decrease of standard cutoﬀ frequency due to diminished molecular ionization

79 and NC (R0 = 30 a.u.)

potential Ip for larger R0. Such a complicated R0-dependent behavior of harmonic cutoﬀ
position revealed in molecular high-harmonic spectra under discussion seems to be very
promising for various applications. To the best of our knowledge, the dissociating di-
atomics with large internuclear separations were predicted ﬁrst in [39] to be capable to
produce high harmonics of frequency far beyond the ”standard” (atomic) cutoﬀ, however,
this idea has not been conﬁrmed yet by experiments. Particularly, when the nuclei are
separated by a distance equal to odd multiples of πα0 (where α0 = (E/ω2) is the classical
amplitude of electron’s excursion in laser ﬁeld), the cutoﬀ limit was shown to extend
beyond Ip + 3.17Up up to Ip + 8Up since the limit of 8Up is the maximum kinetic energy
reachable by the electron during its classical excursion from one atomic center to other
(see also [10]). The results presented in Fig.3 generally conﬁrm such a prediction and
indicate unambiguously that, quite a noticeable extension of high-frequency plateau cut-
oﬀ is to be present in molecular harmonic spectra for very large internuclear separation.
Although, due to relatively small values of R0 used under calculations compared to πα0
110 a.u., the calculated extension of high-frequency plateau is not very impressive.

On the other hand, the values of R0 considered in Figures 2, 3 proved to be suﬃciently
large to conﬁrm the result of previous research [10, 38] showing that molecular harmonic
spectra do not obey the ”Ip + 3.17Up” rule yet for the position of high-frequency cutoﬀ.
Moreover, unlike atomic high-harmonic spectra, the molecular harmonic cutoﬀ is split
due to intramolecular interference and this ”cutoﬀ split” well seen to be a noticeably
broader and more pronounced for larger R0. Also, like in [10], the currently calculated
H +
2 harmonic spectra in Fig.3 clearly demonstrate a signiﬁcant enhancement (up to several
orders of magnitude) in harmonic emission rate as internuclear separation R0 increases.
ε0 (R0)
This is not surprising for diatomics since the respective molecular binding energy
|
is to be smaller for larger R0. The similar enhancement of harmonic emission due to
decreased ionization potential was initially revealed in atomic high-harmonic spectra (see,
e.g., Fig.5 and Fig.10 in [40] as well as references to relevant experiments cited therein).
This also allows for quite a clear explanation, namely, the laser-irradiated species having
a smaller ionization potential are generally more polarizable, so that their response to
the incident laser ﬁeld is expected to be a noticeably stronger than in harder ionized
species. Our results calculated for H +
2 and presented in Fig.3 also conﬁrm that the similar
underlying physical mechanism is responsible for the enhancement of harmonic emission
rate in diatomics for larger internuclear separation as well as the transient enhancement
of the high-harmonic conversion eﬃciency recently found as exceeding the atomic one
in expanding molecules [12, 14]. It is also very interesting that Fig.3 still demonstrates
noticeable diﬀerences in details of two high-harmonic spectra of H +
2 corresponding to
diﬀerent 1σg and 1σu initial molecular states and calculated for large R0 = 30 a.u., at
which generic structural features (e.g., such as orbital symmetry) of particular laser-
irradiated diatomic are expected to have a very minor importance.

|

Another remarkable feature well recognized in molecular harmonic spectra presented
in Fig.3a is a suﬃciently pronounced local minimum clearly visible within the high-
frequency plateau region and located respectively at N = 55 for R0 = 4 a.u., N = 53 for
R0 = 15 a.u. and N = 49 for R0 = 30 a.u. The minima seem to be similar to those revealed
earlier in numerically calculated molecular high-harmonic spectra [11] and predicted to
arise in harmonic spectra of diatomics with HOMO of bonding symmetry due to destruc-
tive intramolecular interference of photoelectron emission from separated atomic centers
to intermediate continuum states. Like in [11], the interference-related minimum in Fig.3a
shows a regular dependence of its position on internuclear separation and, particularly,

14

min

moves toward a lower frequency domain with increase of R0. Such R0-dependent behavior
is generally in accordance with the semiclassical (although, quite an ad hoc) interpretation
given in [11] and related rule N (HHG)
0) suggested for
location of the minimum. However, the harmonic spectra calculated under the conditions
of [11] and presented in Fig.3a doesn’t seem to conﬁrm the above prediction for location
of the minimum, but rather suggest a diﬀerent (although, quite a raw) approximate rule
N (HHG)
0) . The presently suggested empirical rule seems to
min
be similar to revealed earlier for the interference-related minimum arising in calculated
molecular photoelectron spectra [10, 31] due to direct ATI in diatomics with HOMO of
bonding symmetry. Therefore, the interference-related phenomena arising in molecular
harmonic spectra should also allow for transparent interpretation similar to that given
for molecular ATI [31]. In our opinion, this also remarkably demonstrates a close and
intimate interrelation of molecular ATI and HHG processes.

Since the harmonic generation process is strongly related to ionization, one should
also expect the enhanced harmonic emission rates in laser-irradiated species for which
the ionization rate is also enhanced for some reason. On the other hand, for laser pulses
of suﬃciently high peak intensity I and long pulse duration τ , the enhanced ionization
leads to a faster saturation of ionization and exhaustion of initial state of laser-irradiated
system, which, after reaching the saturation of ionization.is unable to eﬃciently produce
high-order harmonics anymore. This gives rise to quite a natural restriction imposed
I), which
on standard cutoﬀ frequency Ip + 3.17Up (with ponderomotive energy Up ∼
thus cannot be extended yet under further increase of incident laser intensity I over
the saturation intensity Isat. Hence, the laser-irradiated species, such as H2 and O2,
showing a suppression in ionization rate (compared to counterpart systems of nearly
identical ionization potential Ip) are expected to produce harmonics of considerably higher
frequency corresponding to a longer high-frequency plateau with an extended cutoﬀ due
to a noticeably higher laser intensity Isat that saturates ionization. The extension in high-
harmonic spectra of O2 relative to atomic Xe under respective laser saturation intensity
was recently observed in experiment [13] and also partly reproduced in related MO-ADK
calculations [13] based on the Lewenstein atomic HHG model [22].

In order to assess a possible extension of high-frequency plateau in molecular har-
monic spectra of more complex diatomics, such as N2 and O2, compared to respective
atomic counterparts, one has to evaluate ﬁrst the respective saturation laser intensity for
each of laser-irradiated species under consideration. Fig.4 displays our results for total
probability of ionization of O2, Xe, N2 and Ar calculated under conditions of experiment
[13] according to formula (16) extended to the diatomic case based on earlier developed
SFA-LCAO model [31] as described in Sec.3 above. The respective saturation laser in-
tensity Isat is well identiﬁed in Fig.4.and deﬁned as the intensity at which about 99% of
laser-irradiated species being ionized by the end of the laser pulse duration. The results
have been summarized in the Table I, which, for the convenience of direct comparison,
also represents the respective results of [13] calculated according to MO-ADK theory [23].

The table demonstrates a fairly good consistence of our currently calculated results with
the prediction of MO-ADK theory, except the saturation intensity calculated for O2.
The deviation is explained by a diﬀerent value of molecular ionization potential, viz.
Ip (O2) = 12.56 eV used in [13] (see, e.g., Table I presented therein), which is a slightly
higher compared to the currently used experimental value Ip (O2) = 12.07 eV [26]. This
inevitably leads to an overestimated high suppression in ionization of O2 relative to Xe,
thereby giving rise to a noticeably overestimated value of the saturation laser intensity

·
The high-harmonic spectra of O2 presented in Fig.5 demonstrate a noticeable exten-
sion compared to the spectrum of Xe calculated at respectively lower laser saturation
intensity previously found (Fig.5b). At the same time, the extension of molecular high-
frequency plateau and respective cutoﬀ frequency currently calculated for O2 (relative to
Xe) noticeably deviates from the similar extension found in [13] for diﬀerent saturation
intensities calculated using the MO-ADK model. Particularly, the harmonic order NC
for cutoﬀ position in presently calculated harmonic spectrum of O2 is about 39 (versus
calculated 43 and measured 53, both reported in [13]) provided the contribution from the
1πg HOMO is only taken into account, like in [13]. However, the total harmonic spectrum
of O2 presented in Fig.5a and corresponding to the coherent contribution (31) from the
(2p) 1πg HOMO and two closest (2p) 1πu and (1s2s2p) 3σg inner shells additionally taken
into account demonstrate a noticeably longer high-frequency plateau of cutoﬀ located
at NC (O2) = 45 and thus extended relative to Xe, for which the cutoﬀ is located at
NC (Xe) = 29. Note also that the additional extension clearly visible in Fig.5a is mostly
due to the contribution from the inner 3σg valence shell, whose separate contribution
within the cutoﬀ domain is comparable with that from the (2p) 1πg HOMO and always
prevailing with respect to that from the (2p) 1πu, despite the inner 3σg has the higher
ionization potential than 1πg or 1πu. This noted feature seems to be quite a natural
for strongly aligned diatomics under consideration and can be explained by an enhanced
ionization (initial release of electron to intermediate continuum states) from the 3σg MO,
which is a considerably prolate along the internuclear axis. Unlike σ orbitals, π molecu-
lar orbitals (such as 1πg HOMO and inner 1πu in O2) are predominantly oriented along
the direction perpendicular to the internuclear axis, so that the photoelectron emission
(initial release of electron to intermediate continuum states) from π molecular orbitals in
aligned diatomics is a considerably suppressed along the internuclear axis that leads to a
relatively smaller harmonic emission rate (see also the relevant discussion in [31]).

The high-harmonic spectra of N2 and its atomic counterpart Ar calculated for respec-
tive saturation intensities currently found and shown in Table I, are presented in Fig.6.

16

In particular, Fig.6b demonstrates some minor extension of cutoﬀ in harmonic spectrum
of Ar relative to N2 due to a slightly enhanced ionization rate of N2 observed in exper-
iments [25, 26] and related lower laser saturation intensity compared to Ar. The cutoﬀ
position in currently calculated harmonic spectrum of N2 corresponding to the separate
contribution from the (1s2s2p) 3σg HOMO (only taken into account in [13]) is located at
harmonic order about 55 that is well consistent with that calculated in [13]. Meanwhile,
the total harmonic spectrum of N2 presented in Fig.6a and calculated taking the coherent
contribution (30)from two closest inner (2p) 1πu and (2s) 2σu valence shells into account
demonstrates a bit longer plateau of cutoﬀ position at harmonic order NC (N2) = 61
that is in a reasonably good accordance with experimental value measured in [13]. This
noted extension of high-frequency plateau cutoﬀ is also clearly visible to arise mostly due
to 2σu valence shell, whose separate contribution within the cutoﬀ region is comparable
with that from the 3σg HOMO and always prevailing over that from 1πu, even though
the ionization potential of 2σu is higher. Thus, the additional extension due to the con-
tribution from inner valence shells is quite similar to that we observed earlier in the total
high-harmonic spectrum of O2 presented in Fig.5a. This probably might also explain the
diﬀerence between the positions found for harmonic cutoﬀ in high-harmonic spectra of
N2 calculated and observed in [13].

As a ﬁnal remark to the results presented in Table II, we have to comment the respective
HHG results for N2 and Ar reported in [13] and based on MO-ADK calculation of laser
saturation intensity (see Table I in Ref.[13]). Namely,the latter results seem to be at least
confusing and contradicting to the MO-ADK results presented ibidem in Fig.4, which un-
ambiguously shows a considerable suppression for N +
2 ion signal compared to Ar+ for the
shorter laser pulse of duration τ = 30 f s. Under these conditions close to experiment [13]
corresponding to τ = 25 f s, the MO-ADK model suggests the calculated ratio N +
2 /Ar+
for ion signals from N +
2 relative to Ar+ to be nearly around 0.5 (see also Fig.8 in [23]) that
is consistent with relevant experiment [25], at least within the strong-ﬁeld domain where
the tunneling ionization theory is only valid. This, however, implies that the MO-ADK
based calculation would result in an accordingly higher saturation intensity rather for N2

than for Ar, similarly to the suppressed ionization in O2 relative to Xe. Contrary to such
a natural conclusion the calculated laser saturation intensity for N2 was identiﬁed in [13]
1014 W/cm2 reported for
to be a noticeably lower (viz., 3.71
Ar) that seems to be self-contradicting and thus makes a fairly good agreement of the
calculated and measured harmonic cutoﬀ frequency of respective high-harmonic spectra
observed in [13] quite a questionable and controversial.

5. CONCLUSION.

The strong-ﬁeld process of high-order harmonic generation was considered and stud-
ied numerically in a number of laser-irradiated homonuclear diatomics (namely, H +
2 ,
N2 and O2) compared to their atomic counterparts of nearly identical ionization poten-
tial. The proposed strong-ﬁeld molecular HHG model is essentially based on quantum-
mechanical SFA-based approach developed earlier and currently extended to molecular
case using the standard LCAO-MO method applied for adequate reproducing the wave-
function of initial molecular discrete state. The latter wavefunction is approximately
considered as a single-electron and two-centered molecular orbital (MO) consisting of
coherent superposition of few predominantly contributing scaled hydrogen-like atomic
orbitals (AO) centered on each of the atomic cores and thus separated by internuclear
distance R0. The form of contributing AOs is generally diﬀerent for various molecular va-
lence shells (such as σg , πu and πg) of diﬀerent orbital and bonding symmetry. Wherever
appropriate, the comparable contributions from other (inner) molecular valence shells of
a larger binding energy and diﬀerent orbital symmetry are also incorporated. This, par-
ticularly, allows for fully 3D consideration of molecular HHG process as well as deriving
the ﬁnal expressions for amplitude and rate of harmonic emission rate in closed analytical
form available for further numerical calculations.

The calculated molecular high-harmonic spectra were found to exhibit a general shape
similar to atomic ones, with extended high-frequency plateau ending by a well deﬁned
harmonic cutoﬀ. Although, the detailed structure, such as the extent of high-frequency
plateau and respective harmonic emission rates demonstrate a number of noticeable and
remarkable diﬀerences from respective atomic harmonic spectra. These distinct diﬀer-
ences, such as the ”low-frequency hump” and ”cutoﬀ split” arising due to two-centered
nature of molecular bound state, are ascertained to be strongly dependent on the internu-
clear separation R0. For suﬃciently large R0 the molecular harmonic spectra demonstrate
a plateau of a noticeably longer extent and signiﬁcant enhancement in harmonic emission
rates compared to spectra corresponding to equilibrium internuclear separation and cal-
culated under the same laser pulses. In addition, our SFA calculations seem to conﬁrm
the existence of a broad and pronounced minimum predicted to arise in harmonic spectra
of diatomics with HOMO of bonding symmetry due to destructive intramolecular interfer-
ence of contribution from photoelectrons of large momenta emitted from separate atomic
centers [11] to intermediate continuum states. Namely, our results presented in Fig.3a
seem to reproduce R0-dependent behavior of the interference-related minimum found in
1D and/or 2D TDSE calculations [11], although also suggest a bit diﬀerent (compared
to [11]) approximate rule for location of this minimum in molecular harmonic spectra.

Finally, the average harmonic emission rate proved to be very sensitive to orbital
symmetry of molecular orbital and its predominant orientation with respect to the in-
ternuclear molecular axis, insomuch that for some group of harmonics the contribution
from inner molecular shell of higher binding energy (but, diﬀerent orbital symmetry) can

18

be comparable (or even predominant within the plateau cutoﬀ region) relative to that
from the HOMO. Also, due to a high suppression revealed in ionization rate for O2 rela-
tive to Xe atom, the harmonic spectrum calculated for O2 was found to demonstrate a
high-frequency plateau of a considerably longer extent (and accordingly higher harmonic
cutoﬀ frequency) than in spectrum of Xe atom, for which the saturation laser intensity
was calculated to be a noticeably smaller. To conclude, the numerically studied behavior
of harmonic spectra calculated for O2, N2 and H +
2 depending on the problem parameters
proved to be in a reasonable or fairly good accordance with relevant data calculated by
earlier authors and observed in molecular HHG experiments.

sity presently found and summarized in Table I. (a) The spectra of O2 corresponding to
partial contributions from the 1πg HOMO (open circles), the inner 1πu (ﬁlled triangles)
and 3σg (ﬁlled squares) valence shells separately are presented vs overall O2 spectrum cor-
responding to coherent contribution (32) from those three highest-lying molecular valence
shells under consideration put together (stars), (b) The overall harmonic spectrum of O2
presented vs the Xe spectrum (ﬁlled diamonds) calculated for respective (diﬀerent from
O2) saturation laser intensity. The results of Fig.5b are to be compared with relevant
ones presented in Fig.5 of Ref.[13].

Abstract. The nuclear polarization of H2 molecules formed by recombination of nuclear polarized H atoms

on the surface of a storage cell initially coated with a silicon-based polymer has been measured by using

the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry in deep-inelastic positron-proton scattering. The molecules are

found to have a substantial nuclear polarization, which is evidence that initially polarized atoms retain

their nuclear polarization when absorbed on this type of surface.

Fig. 1. A beam of nuclear-polarized hydrogen atoms is

generated by an atomic beam source (ABS) [13] and in-

jected into the center of the storage cell [14] via a side

tube. The atoms then diﬀuse to the open ends of the cell

where they are removed by a high speed pumping system.

A magnetic ﬁeld of 330 mT surrounding the cell provides

a quantization axis for the spins and inhibits nuclear spin

relaxation by eﬀectively decoupling nucleon and electron

spins. The atoms diﬀusing from a second side tube of the

cell are analyzed by a Breit-Rabi polarimeter (BRP) [10]

which measures the polarization of the atoms and by a tar-

get gas analyzer (TGA) [15] which determines the atomic

fraction.

2.1.1 Cell surface

The nuclear polarization of recombined H2 molecules

was recently measured in a separate experiment at IUCF

[11]. The nuclear polarization of the molecules obtained by

recombination of polarized atoms on a copper surface was

measured by elastic proton-proton scattering. The other

existing measurement of polarization of recombined atoms

concerns tensor polarized D atoms recombining on a cop-

per surface at AmPS [12]. The absence of any measure-

ment of the nuclear polarization of molecules recombined

on a surface involving a silicon-based polymer motivated

The uncertainty of the measurement is dominated by

the low statistics of the data taken at 260 K (0.19 mil-

lion events) compared to the 100 K data sample (2.5 mil-

lion events). The statistical uncertainty corresponds to the

change in the value of χ2(β260K ) by one unit from its

minimum, and was found to be independent of the value

of β100K . The main source of the systematic uncertainty

arises from the knowledge of α260K

. Unfortunately, the

sampling corrections described in Section 2.2 cannot be

applied at 260 K as the associated systematic uncertainty

grows rapidly if αr is signiﬁcantly below unity. Hence, an

The loss of polarization of the molecule after recombi-

nation has been described in Ref. [11]. In free ﬂight, the

internal molecular ﬁelds Bc from the spin-rotation inter-

action and the direct dipole-dipole interaction cause the

nuclei to rapidly precess around a direction which is skew

to the external ﬁeld by Bc/B. The orientation of Bc is

randomized at each wall collision. Between successive wall

collisions, the component of the polarization along the ex-

ternal ﬁeld decreases by an amount (Bc/B)2 and after n

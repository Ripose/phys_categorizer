Fock’s theory of hydrogen atom and quantum
space

Abstract

It is shown that V.A.Fock’s theory of hydrogen atom gives an ex-

ample of the non-relativistic Snyder-like Quantum Geometry (QG).

1 Introducton

V.A.Fock’s theory of hydrogen atom [1] is a very bright landmark in the
history of quantum theory. Many physicists trust that the meaning of this
theory is much more general and important than the explanation of the
symmetry of one speciﬁc atomic system though very important one. They
believe that its actual meaning still must be understood, that it contains
some ”signal form the future”, some features of the true quantum theory
of particle interactions. The search for this more general sense of [1] can
only be based on attempts to develop V.A.Fock’s idea in this or in that
way, making ”experiments” on it, for example, generalizing it to the case of
the relativistic quantum (ﬁeld) theory. And attempts to interpret [1] in a
new sense take place indeed. Works based on the historical paper [1] have
permanently appeared since the time it was published in 1935, certifying the
faith of the authors in its more profound destination.

In the present paper an attempt has been made to look at the V.A.Fock’s
approach from the point of view of Quantum Geometry and noncommutative
diﬀerential calculus. This work is a development of the article [9].

There are no grounds to transfer the geometric notions derived from the
macroscopic experience to small (microscopic) distances. ¿From the philo-
sophical point of view this question has been discussed since ancient times.
The term ”αµǫρωσ” has been introduced similtaneously with ”ατ ωµωσ” and
denotes the smallest, indivisible portion of the space.

The suggestions to consider geometry as a subject of quantisation natu-
ally appeared almost similtaneously with quantum theory itself. So Quantum
Geometry (QG) is as old as quantum theory itself. One of the ﬁrst QG models
was suggested by H.Snyder [2], [3]. In this approach usual commuting posi-
tion operators were changed for the noncommuting quantities of a concrete
form. W.Pauli [3] stressed that new Snyder’s coordinate operators could be
considered as boosts of the momentum space of constant curvature (De Sitter
or Anti De Siter momentum space). In other words, the Snyder quantization
of space-time is based on the substitution of the pseudo-Euclidean geometry
of the momentum space by the De Sitter geometry.

To be more exact, actually Snyder didn’t use the connection of his quan-
tum coordinates with generators of the isometry group of the curved mo-
mentum space (see [3]). The idea to consider the momentum space with
non-Euclidean geometry as a cornerstone of the theory with quantum space-
time belongs to Yu.A.Golfand [5] and was developed by I.E.Tamm [6] and
others [7]-[12].

Such a change of the geometry of the momentum space leads to the mo-
diﬁcation of the procedure of extension of the S-matrix oﬀ the mass shell
[11], i.e. to the diﬀerent dynamical description. In fact, the statement on the
geometry of the momentum space oﬀ the mass shell is an additional axiom
of quantum ﬁeld theory (QT). Actually in the standard QFT, this axiom is
accepted without saying. In the nonrelativistic theory, the extension oﬀ the
energy shell on he ground of Schr¨odinger equation in the momentum space
and Lippmann-Schwinger equation must be considered.

We can think that some background interaction exists, which modiﬁes
the geometry of the momentum space. See in this connection [8]. As we
have stressed above, all other axioms are fulﬁlled, including the standard
translation invariance. The last means that there are relative coordinates
(properly deﬁned) which are the subjects of quantization [11]. In consequence
of the change of the geometry of the p-space the space-time becomes quantum

2

(noncommutative).

We stress that physical meaning of the geometry and topology of the
momentum space has not obtained clear physical interpretation yet. The
space-time groups considered in QFT as the covariance groups are the groups
isometry groups of space-time.

It is worth to mentioning a series of recent papers [14]-[16] where it has
been shown that the curved momentum space and the corresponding Snyder-
like quantum space naturally arise when considering the 2+1 model of gravity
interacting with the scalar ﬁeld.
(The canonical momenta belong to the
hyperboloid in four-dimensional projective hyperboloid.)

The explicit character of Snyder’s approach to space-time quantization
has a remarkable consequence: we can deﬁne the spectrum of a commutative
∧
xµ and other generators of the De Sitter
set of operators constructed from
group. As it has been shown in [11], the formulation of the generalized causal-
ity condition and QFT in terms of the points of this new numerical quantum
space-time is as comprehensive procedure as it is in the usual QFT with
the Minkovskian space-time. In this approach the structure of the singular
ﬁeld-theoretic functions is entirely reconstructed as compared to the stan-
dard QFT, and the corresponding perturbation theory is free of ultraviolet
divergences.

In the present paper, we shall use the V.A.Fock’s theory of hydrogen atom
symmetry to show that it is in fact the realization of the picture described
above in the non-relativistic case: The Coulomb ﬁeld fulﬁlls the role of the
background interaction mentioned above, which provides the noneuclidean
geometry of momentum space. The modiﬁed shifts of the last (which are up
to some similarity transformation the Runge-Lenz vector’s components) can
be considered as nonrelativistic analogs of Snyder’s coordinates (2).

The paper is organized as ﬂlows. In Section 2, we recall brieﬂy the nec-
essary moments of the V.A.Fock’s theory of hydrogen atom. In Section 3,
we consider Snyder’s theory. Section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the
spectrum and matrix elements of unitary irreducible representations of the
isometry group of momentum space and the interpretation of the spectrum
as quantum space (QS) is given. It is shown that the Schr¨odinger equation
in QS is a diﬀerential-diﬀerence equation with the increment equal to Bohr’s
radius. In Section 5, an introduction to the noncommutative diﬀerential cal-
culus with impact to apply it to the Schr¨odinger equation in QS is given.
Section 6 contains the theory of Schr¨odinger equation in QS as a noncom-

3

mutative diﬀerential equation in QS. In the last 7th Section an example of
integrable case (q-oscillator) of the generalised Schr¨odinger equation is given.

4 Wave functions and diﬀerential-difference
Schr¨odinger equation in quantum space

As it was shown by V.Fock [1] the solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation
in momentum space (13) are the eigen-functions of the Laplace-Beltrami
operator on the Lobachevsky space (8), or the Casimir operator of the Lorentz
group:

representations of Lorentz group the parameter r runs over the interval

which coincides with the physically admissible region of variation (see
(14)). ¿From the other side the interval (17) is the range of variation of
the relative distance in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Taking these
properties of r into account we interpret the parameter r as the relative
distance in the quantum space [8], [10].

(16), from the other hand side it is the generating function for the radial

expression (18) plays the role of the plane wave in quantum r-space. The
radial solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation in the momentum space can be
obtained from the expansion in spherical harmonics:

It looks now quite natural to make the next step and introduce the inter-
action term V (r) into the free diﬀerential-diﬀerence Schr¨odinger equation in
quantum space (32). ¿From the usual point of view this corresponds to some
perturbations for the Coulomb potential. We stress that there are even inte-
grable cases for such diﬀerential-diﬀerence equations (see [13] and references
therein).

5 Contraction

The important requirement to the theory with curved momentum space is its
correspondence with the usual theory. In the physical regime, when we can
neglect the eﬀects of curvature all relations must go over into the usual ones.
Let us ﬁrst analyse this problem in the momentum space (7). The vicinities
of the tops of both poles

P0 ≈ ±
1

carry the ﬂat geometry. For these regions we are in the regime when
the In¨on¨u-Wigner contraction ([17]) is actual approach. For example the
Snyder’s quantum coordinate operators (15) go over into usual coordinate
operators (1) in these regions.

In classical physics the small p-s correspond to great impact parameters.
In this regime the scattered particle slightly feels the Coulomb ﬁeld. In the
case of the bound states we must consider the orbits corresponding to big
values of principal quantum number n. In the contraction limit all ﬁnite-
diﬀerence relations reduce to standard diﬀerential relations of Quantum Me-

6 Non-Commutative diﬀerential calculus and

ﬁnite-diﬀerence derivatives

We start this section with an historical remark. Referring to the second
Snyder’s paper on quantum space (the second paper of [2]) we invite the
reader to convince that his generalisation of Maxwell’s equations for the case
of QG is based, in fact, on a version of the noncommutative diﬀerential
calculus.

12

Let us show that the ﬁnite-diﬀerence Schr¨odinger equation (33) is na-
turally described in terms of noncommutative diﬀerential calculus [18]-[23].
This calculus can be naturally and most easily introduced on a ground of
the theory of diﬀerential forms as its deformation. We shall limit ourselves
with the diﬀerential calculus over the associative algebra A over R or C. In
our case the necessity to consider an algebra over C follows from the form
of ﬁnite-diﬀerence Schr¨odinger equation, containing shifts by the imaginary
quantity ia. This is general property of ﬁnite-diﬀerence Schr¨odinger equation
(33) corresponding to the continuous part of the spectrum of hydrogen atom,
requiring to consider the wave functions in the complex ρ-plane. Finite linear
combinations of elements of A and ﬁnite products are again elements of A.
The multiplication is associative. A diﬀerential calculus on A is a Z- graded
associative algebra over C

Let A be the algebra of all functions on C. In what follows we consider
the one dimensonal case. It is generated by canonical coordinate function
of one variable ψ(ρ) = ρ . One of the simplest deformation of the ordinary
diﬀerential calculus on A is

d

[dρ, ρ] =

dρ

i
2

where i (in dimensional units ia) is the step in the ﬁnite-difference Schr¨o-
dinger equation. To establish the connection between the noncommutative
differential calculus and ﬁnite-difference operations in (Schr¨odinger eq.) is
our goal here. This is a special case of of the commutation structure (47)
considered above. Similar relations are encountered when considering the
diﬀerential calculus on the lattice [18] - [23]. Equation (60) can be rewritten
in a form

which can be generalised to he total algebra A as

Then we can introduce the generalised derivatives (left and right) cor-
responding to our deformed diﬀerential calculus. For the left derivative we
write

dψ(ρ) =

∂ ψ(ρ)

¿From Leibniz rule (44) we have

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

d (ψ(ρ) ϕ(ρ)) = dρ

diﬀerence radial derivative” from this equation making a substituton

Abstrat. (cid:21) Multi-eletron giant dipole resonanes of atoms in rossed eletri and magneti

(cid:28)elds are investigated. Stationary on(cid:28)gurations orresponding to a highly symmetri arrange-

ment of the eletrons on a deentered irle are derived, and a normal-mode stability analysis

is performed. A lassi(cid:28)ation of the various modes, whih are dominated either by the mag-

neti or Coulomb interations, is provided. A six-dimensional wave-paket dynamial study,

based on the MCTDH approah, is aomplished for the two-eletron resonanes, yielding in

partiular lifetimes of more than 0.1 µs for strong eletri (cid:28)elds.

Introdution. (cid:21) Atoms exposed to strong external (cid:28)elds have proven to be a persistent

soure of intriguing phenomena with ma jor impat on a variety of other (cid:28)elds suh as the

quantum dynamis of (cid:28)nite systems or Laser spetrosopy of Rydberg atoms [1(cid:21)3℄. Fousing

on rossed eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds, new on(cid:28)gurations of the hydrogen atom, the so-alled

giant dipole states, were disovered in the nineties [4(cid:21)6℄. These states represent a new form

of mirosopi matter where the eletron and proton are separated by large distanes due to

the presene of an eletri (cid:28)eld: There exists an outer potential well whose bound atomi

states possess a huge eletri dipole moment. The atomi wave funtion then resembles an

osillating barbell in ontrast to the usual shell-like struture of the eletroni states in (cid:28)eld-

free spae. In refs. [7℄ the giant dipole states of Positronium have been investigated, thereby

arriving at the onlusion that the deentered positron-eletron on(cid:28)guration is a quasistable

state, i.e., the matter-antimatter system ould be prevented from annihilation for very large

time sales up to several years. Reently, dipolar matter has also beome of ma jor interest in

the ontext of ultraold atomi and moleular physis, suh as dipolar quantum gases [8℄ or

ultraold moleular Rydberg states [9℄.

In the present investigation we onsider an N

−eletron atom (total mass M ) where the
eletrons (m) and the nuleus, interating via the Coulomb potential V , are sub jet to rossed

eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds. The translational invariane yielding the onservation of the

total anonial momentum in the absene of the (cid:28)elds is now lost, whih manifests itself in

gauge. It is only reently that gauge-independent pseudoseparations for one-eletron [6℄ and

many-eletron systems [14℄ have been performed. The latter provided a generalized potential

for the eletroni motion, possessing ma jor impat on the predition of new strutures and

e(cid:27)ets in rossed (cid:28)elds suh as the deentered giant dipole states [6, 14℄. Our starting point is

existene of an outer well and bound giant dipole states for su(cid:30)iently strong (external and/or

motional) eletri (cid:28)elds in the one-eletron ase.

Little is known, however, about multi-eletron giant dipole resonanes (GDR) whih are

the sub jet of the present investigaton: In Ref. [14℄ a naturally limited analytial investigation

of the deentered two-eletron on(cid:28)guration was performed. It provided evidene, but no (cid:28)nal

onlusion, on the existene of highly symmetri deentered resonanes. In the following we

derive the eletroni on(cid:28)gurations orresponding to the deentered N

−eletron giant dipole

resonanes. We lassify the modes and investigate their stability. Moreover, a numerially

exat six-dimensional wave-paket dynamial investigation of two-eletron resonanes will be

performed, supplying valuable information on lower bounds of the lifetimes of the GDR.

Stationary deentered on(cid:28)gurations. (cid:21) With the gauge-independent generalized poten-

tial at hand, let us searh for deentered stationary points, being andidates for on(cid:28)gurations

for the range K/Kcr ∈ [1, 10] (B = 10

). Imaginary parts appear as solid lines, while points (+) are

used for the real parts. (cid:21) The top horizontal line represents four almost degenerate ylotron modes.

Below, the four Coulomb modes fall o(cid:27) quikly and interset the CM mode (the nearly horizontal

line about four orders below the ylotron modes). There are two residual deay modes, whose slope

is twie that of the Coulomb modes.

into the details, we mention that there are ertain interations among di(cid:27)erent mode types.

Their prinipal auses are rossings between the CM mode and the deay modes (resulting

in some striking deformations of the usual line pattern), and avoided rossings of the CM

mode with at least some of the Coulomb modes. This may be taken as a hint for the di(cid:27)erent

symmetry relations among the Coulombi and the deay modes.

Let us remark on the in(cid:29)uene of the global rotations ∆. While the stationary harater
is not a(cid:27)eted by a ommon rotation of the relative oordinates si by an angle ∆ on the

irle, the dynamis di(cid:27)ers.

In order to see this dependene, we inspet the modes as a

funtion of the rotation angle {
}. Apart from an obvious symmetry(cid:22)note that rotating
by ΦN = 2π/N gives an indistinguishable setup(cid:22)we found that the Coulomb modes and
the deay modes show a pronouned periodi hange. For the ase N = 2, we enounter an
exeptional behavior whenever ∆ omes lose to 0 mod π . One of the Coulomb modes then

γρ(∆)

tends to zero, along the way turning real. In this respet, the loal stability indiated above

is appliable only outside the singular horizontal on(cid:28)guration ∆ = 0.

Wave-paket dynamial study. (cid:21) We now turn to a numerial study of the two-eletron

system (N = 2). We emphasize that a six-dimensional resonane study is at the frontier of

what is urrently possible and requires a areful hoie of the omputational approah. This

applies espeially in view of the fat that our system is governed by dramatially di(cid:27)erent time

sales (see below). Therefore we adopted the Multi-Con(cid:28)guration Time-Dependent Hartree

(mtdh) method [15, 16℄, a wave-paket propagation sheme known for its outstanding e(cid:30)-

ieny in high-dimensional settings. Its basi idea is to solve the time-dependent Shrödinger

equation by expanding the wave funtion in a moderately sized time-dependent basis related

to Hartree produts. We stress that this approah is designed for distinguishable partiles.

Applying it to a fermioni system like ours (cid:28)nds its sole justi(cid:28)ation in the fat that the spatial

6

separation between the eletrons is so large that they are virtually distinguishable.

Let us (cid:28)rst point out how the omputational method an be applied to our problem. There

are essentially two on(cid:29)iting types of motion and orresponding sales: perpendiular to the

102 a.u. (for the strong laboratory (cid:28)eld
magneti (cid:28)eld, we have the magneti length RB

take plae approximately in a harmoni potential(cid:22)we an use the usual osillator lengths

1/√mωz as an estimate. These are roughly on the order of 103

Within our numerial study we fous on the investigation of the stability of the giant dipole

states by using the propagation of harmoni-osillator wave pakets initially loalized at the

extremal position. Relaxation tehniques have been applied in order to improve the intially

hosen wave paket. Moreover, following the evolution of wave pakets with an initial displae-

ment from the extremum, we tested the robustness of the resonanes. For omparison, we also

Very lose to the ritial point, e.g. K = 1.1Kcr, the observed motion is unstable for
several degrees of freedom, spei(cid:28)ally for those belonging to the relative vetor s⊥ = (x, y)T
perpendiular to the magneti (cid:28)eld, on a time sale of 103 ps. Other modes are a(cid:27)eted too
via ouplings. This is a general fat, but for K = 1.1Kcr it is very pronouned, whereas it
is suppressed for the time evolution in ase of larger values of K due to the weaker Coulomb

modes (see Fig. 2).

For K being twie its ritial value, K = 2Kcr , the vertial on(cid:28)guration is virtually
104 ps. As opposed to the ase K/Kcr = 1.1, the instability is
stable on a sale of T
almost exlusively due to the relative motion in y . However, the response of the system
upon displaing the initial wave paket in Z and z by 2, 000 a.u. unveiled that x is rendered

rather unstable. Hene the resonane is expeted to be less robust, although its lifetime is

not signi(cid:28)antly redued altogether. To illustrate the resonane harater of the system, Fig.

For K = 10Kcr, we (cid:28)nd the system to be pratially stable on the time sale T = 105 ps.

The initial wave paket experienes only tiny deformations with respet to all degrees of

freedom but z , showing some osillatory behavior. However, those are still marginal ompared

to the spatial extension of the deentered state. As a result of our wave-paket dynamial

study, we an onlude that the lifetimes of the GDR for su(cid:30)iently large K are beyond 0.1µs.
To omplete the disussion, let us touh on the e(cid:27)ets of di(cid:27)erent irular on(cid:28)gurations ∆

of the GDR. As examples, we investigated both the supposedly unstable `horizontal on(cid:28)gura-

tion' (∆ = 0) and a `diagonal on(cid:28)guration' (∆ =

Conlusion and outlook. (cid:21) Our investigation shows that atoms in rossed (cid:28)elds exhibit

multi-eletron giant dipole states with extraordinary lifetimes. These resonanes onstitute

highly symmetri and exoti states of matter, where the elerons are strongly orrelated and

an, for laboratory (cid:28)eld strengths, be separated from the nuleus (or positively harged ore)

by many thousand Bohr radii. An experimental preparation of the giant dipole states might

employ the sheme suggested for single eletrons [17℄. The latter is based on the preparation

of Rydberg states via Laser exitation, followed by a sequene of eletri-(cid:28)eld swithes that

arry the exited eletrons to the deentered on(cid:28)guration. Preparing di(cid:27)erent initial Rydberg

states, like irular ones, enhanes the variety of aessible deentered states.

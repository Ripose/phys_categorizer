Optical absorption in a degenerate Bose gas

Abstract

We here develop a theory on optical absorption in a dilute Bose gas at
low temperatures. This theory is motivated by the Bogoliubov theory of el-
ementary excitations for this system, and takes into account explicitly the
modiﬁcation of the nature and dispersion of elementary excitations due to
Bose-Einstein condensation. Our results show important diﬀerences from ex-
isting theories.

PACS numbers: 03.75.Fi, 32.70.Jz, 32.80.-t

A remarkable property of a degenerate Bose gas is the modiﬁcation of the nature of exci-
tations in the system. This has been elucidated by the work of Feymann and Bogoliubov [1].
For a classical or non-degenerate Bose gas, elementary excitations are basically quasiparti-
cles. For a degenerate Bose gas however, the long wavelength elementary excitations are the
same as density waves of the system, propagating at the sound velocity. They correspond to
neither addition nor removal of a quasiparticle, but a linear combination of both. At short
wavelengths these excitations resemble more closely quasiparticles, with the dispersion the
same as free particles apart from a shift.

Recently there is much interest in optical excitations in dilute degenerate Bose gas. The
frequency of absorption has been used as an indication of the formation of Bose-Einstein
condensation in the system [2]. An optical excitation is a non-trivial process, as one of the
original atoms (referred to as a-atoms below), all identical before the excitation occurs, is
converted to another one which is distinguishable from all the others. Moreover a-atoms
which are not excited internally interact diﬀerently with this ‘foreign’ atom (referred to as
c-atom below) than among themselves, and must respond by rearrangement of their relative
motion. The frequencies at which optical absorption occur are therefore diﬀerent from ω0,
the value for a single isolated atom.

Optical absorption in a Bose gas has been considered by Oktel and Levitov [3], and also
by Pethick and Stoof [4]. Johnsen and Kavoulakis [5] considered the case of excitons in
semiconductors where the initial and ﬁnal bosons have diﬀerent eﬀective masses, using an
approximation equivalent to that used by Oktel and Levitov [3]. Let us brieﬂy summarize
the main results of Ref. [3] most relevant to the discussions below. These authors concen-
trate on intermediate to high temperatures and ignore the modiﬁcations of the nature of
quasiparticles below the transition temperature. They make the dramatic prediction that,
for T < Tc and in the limit of no momentum transfer, there is actually not one but two
absorption lines. These lines are located at the frequencies

Here we would like to re-examine and extend this investigation to low temperatures. In
particular, we are interested in the eﬀects brought about by the macroscopic occupation
of the lowest energy state. Note that not only the dispersion is changed for T < Tc, but
also that now the annihilation of an a-atom can correspond both to an absorption and a
creation of a Bogoliubov excitation. We shall see that properly accounting for these features
substantially modiﬁes the absorption spectrum. In general it no longer simply consists of
two lines. In some regimes where the spectrum is approximately two relatively sharp lines,
the frequencies of these lines diﬀer from those of eq (1).

p1 + p2 = p3 + p4. V is the volume. The Hamiltonian of the system containing also a c-atom
is given by H = Ha + Hc + Hac. Hc describes the free motion of the c-atom

where we have neglected the eﬀective mass change in the optical transition. ω0 accounts for
the internal energy diﬀerence between the a and c atoms. Hac describes the interaction of
the c-atom with the rest of the a-atoms. We write it as

is generated automatically. This operator was not taken into account in ref [3]. Also, if
the Hamiltonian were to consist of Ha alone, these equations, together with those with a†

in some detail the contributions from Hac and emphasize another crucial diﬀerence of our
present treatment from that of [3]. Consider cka†

below): the c-atom can be scattered from k + q to k in two ways in the presence of a
condensate, either by removing/adding one condensate atom while creating/annihilating
q. Note that each of these in turn can correspond to emission/annihilation

pure a-atom system ( For simplicity, we shall choose the gauge where up and vp are all

The interpretation of these equations is clear by an examination of their form. In the

Ep, and ξp+k + Ep respectively. These diﬀerent possibilities of excitons are coupled

Let us ﬁrst check how our results reduce to those of [3] for T > Tc. In this regime there
is no need to treat η(0)
in a special manner since N0 is no longer macroscopic. Also up = 1

p,k and equation (9) becomes equivalent to that
used in Ref. [3]. For k = 0 there is only one line and the frequency is given by, from eq (9),
ω′ = gacn. Since µ = 2gaan, ω = 2(gac −
For T < Tc we need to consider the three coupled linear equations (8-10). The terms
on the right hand side involving explicitly gac represent ‘vertex corrections’ if the above
calculations were formulated in terms of Feymann diagrams. They in general cannot be
ignored. However, it is of interest to pretend that this can be done and examine the results.
This is a good approximation at very low temperatures for small gaseous parameters ( see

An example for gac/gaa = 20 is as shown in Fig. 1. At very low temperatures t = 0.1

the absorption is basically a sharp line at dimensionless frequency ˜ω
except for small wings from absorption (emission) of quasiparticles at frequencies above
(below) the main absorption line. At increasing temperatures the lower frequency wing
grows, eventually evolves into something which resembles a sharp line at a frequency which
decreases with temperature. At the same time the upper line increases in frequency. We
checked that at higher temperatures than the ones shown, the weight of the lower (upper)
line decreases (increases). While our calculation cannot be simply extended into higher
temperatures (see below), we believe that the upper line will eventually evolve to the line

The results for a large and negative gac is as shown in Fig 2. At very low temperatures
the results are qualitatively similar to positive gac. However, at temperatures as low as
t = 0.4 the results are qualitatively diﬀerent from those of gac > 0. The upper line is much
broader and extends to much higher frequencies. The dependence on the sign of gac becomes
even more signiﬁcant at higher temperatures, as shown in Fig 3 for t = 1.0. Note that for
2s transition in atomic hydrogen [2], gac/gaa is likely to be large and negative. The
the 1s
implication of this on experiments in traps where the density is non-uniform needs however
further investigations.

Though we found basically two lines at intermediate temperatures, we note here that
the separation between the lines are quantitatively diﬀerent from those predicted in [3].
Since the distinctions between quasiparticles and real particles are ignored in [3] there is
an ambiguity in generalizing eq. (1) quantitatively, according to whether one uses the total
n′(0) for
number of excitations, or the total number of p
nT . For the ﬁrst choice we ﬁnd that, e.g., for gac/gaa = 20 at t = 1.0, ˜ω should be given by
3.76, while the second choice produces an
2.49 and
even bigger separation between the two lines. In all cases the separations between the lines
are overestimated (c.f. Fig 3). The disagreement for all choices further worsens at higher
temperatures. We believe that these diﬀerences result from the neglect in [3] of the third

3.1. The third choice yields 3.39 and

channel ( ‘type 2 excitons’).

We have also investigated the dependence of the absorption spectrum on the (modiﬁed)
gaseous parameter (n0a3)1/2. A smaller (n0a3)1/2 reduces (enhances) the eﬀect due to the
thermal excitations and the result resembles those of a lower (higher) temperature.

The treatment here is restricted to dilute gases at relatively low temperatures. At higher
temperatures one need to worry about more complicated objects involving annihilation and
creation of multiple Bogoliubov excitations, and the interaction among these various chan-
nels. The theory for optical absorption will become much more complicated just as a theory
of the elementary excitations will be at these temperatures.

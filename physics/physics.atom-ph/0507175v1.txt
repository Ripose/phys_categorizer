We use classical electron ensembles and the aligned-electron approximation to examine the eﬀect
of laser pulse duration on the dynamics of strong-ﬁeld double ionization. We cover the range of
intensities 1014 − 1016W/cm2 for the laser wavelength 780 nm. The classical scenario suggests that
the highest rate of recollision occurs early in the pulse and promotes double ionization production
in few-cycle pulses. In addition, the purely classical ensemble calculation predicts an exponentially
decreasing recollision rate with each subsequent half cycle. We conﬁrm the exponential behavior by
trajectory back-analysis.

Detailed study of the classical picture of two-electron
and multi-electron ejection from atoms and molecules is
becoming important as short-pulse and high-ﬁeld exper-
imental work moves into the multi-electron regime [1].
This is because it is well recognized that there is no re-
alistic prospect of a quantum mechanical treatment of
atomic and molecular multi-electron phenomena under
the relevant experimental conditions, i.e., under highly
non-perturbative ﬁelds with femtosecond and shorter
time resolution. The exact solution of Schr¨odinger’s
time-dependent equation for helium double ionization in
this regime by the Taylor group [2] is accepted as the
farthest that a comprehensive quantum treatment will
go in the foreseeable future. At the same time, evidence
has been accumulating that a purely classical scenario
[3, 4] is consistent with many of the double ionization
eﬀects that are observed, and can be adapted further for
multiple electrons.

Simultaneous ejection of two electrons from atoms
more complex than helium has been under experimental
study for more than two decades [5], and has been studied
intensely in the decade since the discovery and conﬁrma-
tion [6] of a knee-like structure in the experimental ion
count measurements in several inert gases, now accepted
as implying anomalously high electron correlation. This
signature has been reported for some molecules as well
[7]. Theoretical work based on a sequential ionization
process involving independent electrons [8] is known to
be inadequate to produce the knee signature.

The prevailing picture of double ionization builds on
the familiar electron rescattering scenario proposed for
NSDI by Corkum [9]. In this picture, one electron is ion-
ized by the Keldysh mechanism [10], tunneling out of the
nucleus through a Coulomb barrier that has been lowered
by the strong laser ﬁeld. Then the laser ﬁeld returns it in
a purely classical fashion to the nucleus to collide with the
bound electron and free it. A relatively direct classical
analysis, without tunneling, of the eﬀect can be based on
solutions of Newtonian equations for individual electron
trajectories obtained from large ensembles of 100,000 -
1,000,000 members, which can be interpreted in a clear
way [11]. An example of a pair of energy trajectories

measured in laser cycles, showing a pair of two-electron tra-
jectories, with the trapezoidal laser ﬁeld envelope f (t) super-
posed for reference. During laser turn-on the bound electrons
exchange energy rapidly, and soon after laser turn-on is com-
plete one (lighter red line) escapes and then returns in re-
peated e-e recollisions until the inner electron (darker blue
line) also has enough energy to escape the nucleus, and thus
the pair become doubly ionized. Notice that after each rec-
ollision, the energy of the inner electron is modiﬁed, and the
outer electron carries diﬀerent energies in each recollision.

is shown in Fig. 1, where a sequence of rescatterings is
clearly evident. Agreement between such classical and
more elaborate partly or entirely quantum calculations
[12, 13, 14, 15] is remarkably good [16, 17, 18].

Here we use the classical ensemble method [11] with
100,000 2-e trajectories and laser pulses with diﬀer-
ent numbers of laser cycles over a range of intensities,
1014 − 1016 W/cm2. Each laser pulse has the experimen-
tal wavelength 780 nm. Our laser ﬁeld is taken to be a
sine wave [19] with maximum ﬁeld E and a trapezoidal
envelope function 1 ≥ f (t) ≥ 0 with 2-cycle turn-on and
turn-oﬀ, which is shown superposed on Fig. 1. For this
report the number of cycles in the plateau ranges from
0 to 10. The trapezoidal shape is chosen because it pro-
vides a ﬁxed plateau intensity and is known to suppress
eﬀects associated solely with turn-on [20].

To begin we show in Fig. 2 that in the domain of

2

is released. This uncertainty has begun to be eliminated
by the ability to use shorter pulses [21], which can sup-
press recollision eﬀects requiring more than one cycle.
These experiments show that double ionization does not
require multiple recollisions, consistent with the “quan-
tum” picture. The open question is whether the classi-
cal theory, which has multiple-recollisions as typical, and
doesn’t invoke tunneling, agrees with this. The preser-
vation of the knee signature in short pulses as shown in
Fig. 2 conﬁrms that NSDI can still proceed in the ab-
sense of the typical multiple-recollisions. This positive
answer prompts another question: how does this classi-
cal picture incorporate both of these long and short pulse
duration NSDI schemes? As we show here, the answer
further conﬁrms the attraction of a purely classical pic-
ture.

In order to accomplish classical double ionization the
outer electron must ﬁnd the inner electron in a suitable
phase relation to its motion while going through the nu-
clear region. We have already demonstrated [16] the eﬃ-
cacy of well-phased (what were called “slow-down”) rec-
ollisions. Of course, the outer electron may or may not
return to the nucleus to make a recollision. If it returns
to the nucleus, the recollision may take place in a condi-
tion that is more or less favorable than in the previous
encounter. Because of the energy exchange that initially
helped free the outer electron, the inner electron is gener-
ally to be found near the bottom of the nuclear potential
well, where its bound oscillations are rapid and random.
In a large ensemble it is reasonable that there will always
be some in the right phase relation, even very early in the
pulse.

Our data conﬁrms this qualitative picture, and pro-
vides features not available in a quantum calculation, i.e.,
data based on speciﬁc recollision counts. This can pro-
vide insights that are otherwise inaccessible. The ﬁrst
example is shown in Fig. 3. Here we show a new form of
time record for pulses with 16 diﬀerent intensities. We
count the number of trajectories that ﬁt the “recollid-
ing” deﬁnition [22] at 256 time instants, i.e., 32 times
per cycle, for 8-cycle pulses at 16 diﬀerent intensities. In
these records the intensities are low enough that the en-
tire recollision sub-ensemble is smoothly depleted during
the double ionization over 8 cycles, and one can antici-
pate a straightforward analysis, as follows.

With each successful recollision some of the available
population is removed. This means that the next recolli-
sion has a fraction fewer candidates available for double
ionization. A fractional decrease per half cycle is the
same as predicting an exponential decrease in the num-
ber of recollisions over time. To make a check of this pre-
diction the classical approach suggests use of our “back-
analysis” method [16], but the number of successful dou-
ble ionizations in any half cycle is very small even in a
100,000-member ensemble, making statistical reliability
diﬃcult to achieve. However, the number of recollisions,
successful or not, is much greater and can be used as a
surrogate for the number of successful ones. Fig. 4 shows

FIG. 2: Variation of “knee” structure in laser pulses with
diﬀerent number of plateau cycles (N ). The probability of
double ionization is the number of double ionization events
divided by 100,000, the total number of 2-e trajectories used.

interest here the knee signature of NSDI is preserved in
a classical ensemble theory of the double ion count even
for short pulses. We see that for intensities above the
main knee region the double ionization yield is basically
not dependent on the number of cycles in the pulse. We
will see further evidence that in this regime the ﬁeld is
suﬃciently strong to eﬀect both electrons within a single
cycle.

As Fig. 1 shows, while the pulse is turning on a rapidly
repeated energy exchange occurs between the bound elec-
trons, and this is what permits one to escape (with-
out tunneling) over the Coulomb barrier, which becomes
more and more suppressed as the ﬁeld turns on. Our en-
semble calculations [3] establish that when many cycles
of laser pulse are available Fig. 1 is typical of the clas-
sical process, i.e., the typical double-ionization event has
been preceded by several or even many recollisions. This
picture stands in two-way contrast to the “quantum” pic-
ture in which tunneling is employed to release the ﬁrst
electron, and where double ionization is deemed to occur
in the very ﬁrst recollision cycle.

There has been no way to choose between these two
pictures of the double ionization timing. Experiments do
not reveal how many cycles pass before the ﬁrst electron

FIG. 3: Number of recolliding electrons vs. time, counted at 8 times in each half cycle, for sixteen diﬀerent intensities of 8-cycle
pulses, from 4 × 1013 to 1015 W/cm2. The pulses with intensities in this range, which includes the main knee region, remove
electron pairs smoothly and steadily, leading to the almost exactly exponential decrease of peak numbers through the duration
of the pulse.

ter several or more cycles, the absence of these multiple-
recollision gateways in short pulses reduces the produc-
tion of double ionization as indicated in Fig. 2. However,
at only sightly higher intensities the picture changes.

In Fig. 5 the record shows the same type of data shown
in Fig. 3, but for a range of higher pulse intensities.
The diﬀerence in eﬀect is substantial, not only because
the higher range of intensities promotes more eﬀective
double ionization, but because it also alters the nature
of the process. The recollision begins to occur twice as
rapidly. That is, it starts at the halfway point of the
turn-on. Furthermore, most recollisions occur prior to
peak intensity. The higher intensities in Fig. 5 merely
emphasize this eﬀect. One can see it beginning as early
as in the third row of Fig. 3 where recollision starts prior
to peak intensity. At high intensities, this eﬀect coupled
with the ﬁnding that the double ionization yield does not
depend much on the pulse duration suggests that NSDI
events can be completed within a single cycle.

In summary, we have shown that NSDI production is
predicted by the purely classical theory to occur at short
times well in advance of the typical double ionization
time. We see that the pulse begins to be strong enough
to disturb a substantial fraction of the ensemble even be-
fore the plateau regime is reached at the beginning of the
second cycle. In fact, this distortion is due to the stronger
eﬀect of barrier suppression, which promotes one of the
bound electrons to leave the nucleus, and allows recolli-
sions to take place early in the pulse, which substantially
enhances the NSDI production from a short pulse.

data extracted from Fig. 3 that conﬁrms the exponential
prediction and gives the exponential rates.

One clear feature quickly seen in this new form of data
is that the half cycle that typically has the most rec-
ollisions, gateways to NSDI, is the very ﬁrst one after
the pulse reaches full strength. By itself this establishes
that the classical picture does not neccessarily require
many cycles of recollision in order to generate NSDI elec-
trons. Since the more typical double ionization occurs af-

pulses, from 2 × 1015 to 9 × 1015 W/cm2. The intensities in this range begin to be high enough to distort the NSDI process.
The doubled peaks indicate that a major fraction of all members of the ensemble can be induced to leave the nuclear region in
the same direction at the same time.

We present a novel technique for producing pulses of laser light whose frequency is arbitrarily
chirped. The output from a diode laser is sent through a ﬁber-optical delay line containing a ﬁber-
based electro-optical phase modulator. Upon emerging from the ﬁber, the phase-modulated pulse is
used to injection-lock the laser and the process is repeated. Large phase modulations are realized by
multiple passes through the loop while the high optical power is maintained by self-injection-locking
after each pass. Arbitrary chirps are produced by driving the modulator with an arbitrary waveform
generator.

INTRODUCTION

II. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP

In a variety of applications, it is desirable to be able
to exert rapid and arbitrary control over the frequency
of a laser, while minimizing the associated variations
in intensity. Diode lasers, both free-running and in
external cavities, are particularly amenable to rapid
frequency control via their injection current.[1] However,
current modulation produces not only frequency mod-
ulation, but also intensity modulation, which is often
undesirable. This issue has been addressed by injection-
locking a separate laser with the modulated light.[2]
The frequency modulation is faithfully followed, while
the intensity modulation is suppressed. Linear chirps
up to 15 GHz/µs,[2] as well as signiﬁcantly boosted
output powers [2, 3] have been achieved in this manner.
Other techniques for rapid tuning include electro-optical
crystals located within the diode laser’s external cavity
[3, 4, 5, 6] and ﬁber-coupled integrated-optics waveg-
uides to phase-modulate the laser output.[7, 8, 9] In
the present work, we combine two key elements to
produce pulses of arbitrarily frequency-chirped light: 1)
an electro-optical waveguide phase modulator, located
in a ﬁber loop and driven with an arbitrary waveform
generator; and 2) optical self-injection-locking after each
pass through the loop.[7, 9] Multiple passes around the
loop allow large changes in phase to be accumulated,
and the self-injection-locking maintains a high output
power. We expect such controlled light to be useful in
applications such as adiabatic population transfer,[10]
coherent transients,[11, 12] atom optics,[13, 14] ultracold
collisions,[15] radio-frequency spectrum analyzers based
on spectral hole burning,[16] optical coherent transient
programming and processing,[17] and high-bandwidth
spatial-spectral holography.[18]

A schematic of the experimental set-up is shown in
Fig. 1. The central laser is a free-running diode laser
(FRDL), Hitachi HL7852G, with a nominal output of 50
mW at 785 nm. Its temperature is reduced and stabi-
lized in order to provide a wavelength near the Rb D2
line at 780 nm. The output of this laser is sent through
an optical isolator in order to prevent undesired optical
feedback, and then through two acousto-optical modula-
tors (AOM2 and AOM3) whose purpose will be discussed
below. The beam is then coupled into a 40 m long single-
mode polarization-maintaining ﬁber delay line to prevent
overlap of successive pulses as they propagate around the
loop. Within the loop is a ﬁber-coupled integrated-optics
phase modulator. This device, EOSpace model PM-0K1-
00-PFA-PFA-790-S, is a lithium niobate waveguide de-
vice capable of modulation rates up to 40 Gbit/s when
properly terminated with 50 Ω. Our device is untermi-
nated in order to allow higher voltages (e.g., we use up
to 10 V) to be applied. Upon emerging from this ﬁber
loop, the light is coupled back into the FRDL in order to
(re) injection-lock it.

To initialize the FRDL frequency, we use a seed pulse
from a separate external-cavity diode laser [19] (ECDL)
to injection-lock it. The ECDL can have its frequency
stabilized to a Rb atomic resonance using saturated ab-
sorption spectroscopy. The seed pulse, typically 170 ns in
width, is generated using AOM1. After this initial seed-
ing, the ECDL is completely blocked and the FRDL then
self-injection-locks with the pulses of light emerging from
the ﬁber loop. The two injection sources, which are not
present simultaneously, are merged on a beamsplitter.
This combined beam is directed into the FRDL through
one port of the output polarizing beamsplitter cube of its
optical isolator, thereby insuring unidirectional injection.
Injection powers of 250 µW are typically used.

The timing diagram for the pulse generation is shown
in Fig.
2. The FRDL emits light continuously, but
injection-locks to the ECDL only during the brief seed
pulse. AOM2 is pulsed on in order to switch this pulse
into the ﬁber loop. This ﬁrst-order beam is frequency
shifted by the 80 MHz frequency driving AOM2. AOM3,

FIG. 1: Schematic of the apparatus. The free-running
diode laser (FRDL) is initially injection-locked by a seed
pulse originating from the external-cavity diode laser (ECDL)
and switched on by acousto-optical modulator AOM1. The
injection-locked output pulse from the FRDL is switched into
the ﬁber loop by AOM2. The frequency shift produced by
AOM2 is compensated for by AOM3. The ﬁber loop is con-
nected to a phase modulator (PM) driven by an arbritrary
waveform generator (AWG). The phase-modulated pulse (re)
injection locks the FRDL and the loop cycle is repeated. Af-
ter N passes through the loop, the pulse is combined with
the ECDL output on a fast photodiode (PD) for heterodyne
analysis. Beamsplitters (BS), polarizing beamsplitters (PBS),
and optical isolators (OI) are also shown.

which is on continuously, provides a compensating fre-
quency shift. Without this compensation, a large fre-
quency change would accumulate after multiple passes
around the loop. Such a controllable frequency oﬀset
may be desirable for some applications. After passing
through the ﬁber, the pulse enters the phase modulator.
The desired modulation is imprinted on the pulse with
an 80 MHz (200 MSa/s) arbitrary waveform generator
(AWG): Agilent 33250A. The pulse then exits the ﬁber
and (re) injection-locks the FRDL. The resulting pulse
emerging from the FRDL is an ampliﬁed version of the
phase-modulated pulse. It is sent through the loop again,
in exactly the same manner as the original pulse, for fur-
ther phase modulation. The switching of AOM2 and the
voltage provided to the phase modulator by the AWG
are synchronized to the 221 ns cycle time of the entire
loop using a pulse/delay generator. This ensures that
phase changes for each pass accumulate optimally. After
the desired number of cycles through the loop, AOM2 is
switched oﬀ, opening the loop and sending the pulse to
the diagnostics and/or experiment. The entire sequence
can be repeated at a rate determined by the loop time
and the number of passes around the loop.

Our main diagnostic is to combine the frequency-

seed pulse, generated by AOM1, initiates the process. Sub-
sequent pulses of light from the FRDL, generated by AOM2,

sired phase modulation is applied synchronously during each
pass.

chirped pulse with the ﬁxed-frequency light from the
ECDL and measure the resulting heterodyne signal with
a ﬁber-coupled fast photodiode and 500 MHz oscillo-
scope. We note that a fourth AOM outside the loop (not
shown in Fig. 1) would allow the desired portion of the
ﬁnal chirped pulse to be selected and sent to the exper-
iment. Because the initial seed pulse is typically shorter
than the pulses propagating around the loop (see Fig. 2),
there are portions of the output pulse during which the
FRDL is not injection-locked at the desired frequency.
We intentionally set the unlocked FRDL frequency far
enough from that of the ECDL to ensure that only the
desired portions of the pulse are visible in the heterodyne
signal. Oﬀsets ranging from 3 GHz to 600 GHz have
been utilized, with smaller oﬀsets providing more robust
injection locking. For applications where light far from
the ECDL frequency has no adverse eﬀects, selection by
the fourth AOM may not be necessary.

An important advantage of our scheme is the fact that
the injection locking ampliﬁes the pulse to the original
power level after each cycle, thereby allowing an arbi-
trary number of passes (we have used more than 20)
through the modulator. This ampliﬁcation is also im-
portant because the time-averaged optical power seen by
the modulator must be limited (e.g., to <5 mW at our
operating wavelength) to avoid photorefractive damage.
We require only enough power in the ﬁber output, typi-
cally 750 µW, to robustly injection-lock the FRDL after
each pass.

FIG. 3: Heterodyne signal between the ECDL and the
injection-locked FRDL pulse after 15 passes through the loop.
No phase modulation is applied, so the 80 MHz beat signal is
due to the frequency shift of AOM1.

To verify the ﬁdelity of the injection locking, we per-
form the following test. With no voltage applied to the
phase modulator, we pass a pulse through the loop 15
times before examining its heterodyne signal. Since the
initial seed pulse is shifted 80 MHz by AOM1, and the
shifts from AOM2 and AOM3 are set to cancel, we ex-
pect that the beat signal will be sinusoidal at 80 MHz.
This is indeed the case, as shown in Fig. 3.

The time varying frequency f(t) of a pulse is related to

the modulated phase ϕ(t) by:

f (t) = f0 + (1/2π)(dϕ/dt)

(1)

where f0 is the original carrier frequency (in Hz). The
phase change produced by N passes through the modula-
tor is linear in the applied voltage V with a proportion-
ality constant characterized by Vπ:

∆ϕ = N π(V /Vπ).

(2)

We measure Vπ by applying a linear voltage ramp of 8 V
in 100 ns and measuring the resulting frequency shift of
280 MHz after N=10 passes through the loop, as shown in
Fig. 4. This yields Vπ = 1.4 V, somewhat more eﬃcient
than the speciﬁed value of 1.8 V.

In order to produce a linear chirp, the phase change
should be quadratic in time, requiring a quadratic volt-
age: V(t) = αt2. A series of increasing and decreasing
quadratics, matched at the boundaries, is programmed
into the AWG. This output voltage, together with the
heterodyne signal and the resulting frequency as a func-
tion of time, are shown in Fig. 5. The inverse of the local
period of the heterodyne signal, determined from succes-
sive minima and maxima, is used as the measure of fre-
quency. Linear ﬁts to the decreasing and increasing fre-
quency regions yield chirp rates of -36 and +37 GHz/µs,
respectively. These match well to the value of 38 GHz/µs
expected from the programmed waveform and the value

of Vπ. We note that the chirp shown here is achievable
only with multiple passes due to the input voltage limits
of the modulator. However, if a given chirp range ∆f is
to be achieved in a time interval ∆t, the required voltage
change, ∆V = α(∆t)2 = (Vπ/N)(∆f∆t), is proportional
to ∆t, indicating that faster chirps are easier to produce.

As an example of an arbitrary chirp, we show in
Fig. 6 the result of a phase which varies quadratically
in time with a superimposed sinusoidal modulation.
The resulting frequency as a function of time, shown
in (d), has the expected linear plus sinusoidal variation
and matches quite well the numerical derivative of the
AWG output, shown in (b). Although we have not yet
explored this avenue, it should be possible to correct for
imperfections in the AWG and/or the response of the
phase modulator by measuring the chirp and adjusting
the programmed waveform to compensate.

In summary, we have described a novel technique for
producing pulses of light with arbitrary frequency chirps.
The method is based on multiple passes through a ﬁber-
based integrated-optics phase modulator driven by an ar-
bitrary waveform generator, with self-injection locking af-
ter each pass. Our work has utilized light at 780 nm, but
the chirping concept should work for a variety of wave-
lengths. We have shown examples of frequency shifts,
linear chirps, and linear plus sinusoidal frequency mod-
ulations. We have yet to explore the limitations of this
scheme. We are presently limited in modulation speed by
the waveform generator, and our heterodyne diagnostic
is limited by the bandwidths of both the oscilloscope (500
MHz) and the photodiode (1 GHz). For faster modula-
tions, synchronization of successive passes will become
more critical, but this can be adjusted either electron-
ically or by the optical path length. We note that the
phase modulation need not be identical for each pass,

adding ﬂexibility to the technique. At some point, the
injection locking will not be able to follow the modu-
lated frequency, but we see no evidence of this at the lin-
ear chirp rates of ∼40 GHz/µs (and corresponding chirp
range of ∼2 GHz) which we have so far achieved.

It is interesting to compare our scheme with pulse
shaping in the femtosecond domain.[20] With ultrafast
pulses, there is suﬃcient bandwidth to disperse the light
and separately adjust the phase and amplitude of the
various frequency components (e.g., with a spatial light

modulator) before reassembling the shaped pulse. Our
time scales are obviously much longer (e.g., 10 ns - 100
ns), and we control the phase directly in the time domain.
A logical extension of our work would be to indepen-
dently control the amplitude envelope with a single pass
through a ﬁber-based integrated-optical intensity modu-
lator. As with femtosecond pulse shaping and its appli-
cation to coherent control, time-domain manipulations of
phase and amplitude should be amenable to optimization
via genetic algorithms.

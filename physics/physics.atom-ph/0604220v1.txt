Stochastic properties of loading and loss mechanism in a few atom trap are analyzed. An ap-
proximate formula is derived for the atom-number correlation function for the trapped atoms in the
limit of reasonably small two-atom loss rate. Validity of the approximate formula is conﬁrmed by
numerical simulations.

INTRODUCTION

II. DESCRIPTION OF MODEL

Techniques for trapping small number of atoms in a
microscopic volume have recently become an important
tool for wide range of experiments in atomic physics and
quantum optics such as cold collisions [1], atom metrol-
ogy [2], cavity quantum electrodynamics [3] and quantum
information [4].

There have been numerous measurements of trap load-
ing and loss parameters of a magneto-optical trap (MOT)
with many atoms, but they used indirect methods such
βn2
as ﬁtting to a model curve, dn/dt = R − Γn −
[5], where n is the density of trapped atoms, Γ the loss
rate due to collisions with background atoms, and β a co-
eﬃcient for two-atom collisional process among trapped
atoms. Recently, several groups have trapped a small
number of atoms in a MOT with a strong magnetic ﬁeld
gradient and could observe individual loading and loss
In this way, loading rate R, one-
events in real time.
atom loss rate L1, and two-atom loss rate L2 have been
directly measured [6, 7].

R

The atom-number correlation function has also been
measured from the observed sequence of instantaneous
atom number in a trap [8]. Since no analytic solution
is known for the master equation in the limit of non-
negligible two-atom loss, the study of the atom-number
correlation function has been limited to the case of no
two-atom loss, for which the correlation function does
not provide any further information other than the one-
atom loss rate.

In the present work, we provide a comprehensive frame
work for investigation of the atom-number correlation
function based on the master equation (Chaps. II and
III). An approximate formula has been derived for the
correlation function in the limit of non-negligible two-
atom loss (Chap. IV) and the validity of the approximate
formula has been put to a test by numerical simulations
(Chap. V).

The time dynamics of the atom number N in a trap
is governed by loading and loss processes. The loading
process occurs at a certain rate R, called loading rate,
which is determined by capture ability of the trap. The
capture ability depends on such experimental conditions
as laser intensity, laser beam size, laser-atom detuning
and background source density of atoms but not on the
number of atoms trapped already. We can assume R as
a constant under ﬁxed experimental condition.

The loss rates, on the other hand, are aﬀected by the
number of atoms in the trap. One-atom loss occurs when
one of the trapped atoms collides with a fast-moving
background atom of diﬀerent kind. One atom loss rate is
thus linearly proportional to the number of atoms N al-
ready present in the trap. We deﬁne Γ1 as the one-atom
loss coeﬃcient in such a way that the one atom loss rate
L1 is given by L1 = Γ1N .

Two-atom loss process is due to the collision between
two of the trapped atoms. There are several types of
two-atom collision processes responsible for two-atom
losses. They are ground-state hyperﬁne-changing colli-
sions, ground-excited-state ﬁne-structure changing colli-
sion and ground-excited-state radiative escape. When-
ever these collisions occur, the colliding two atoms can
gain enough kinetic energy for escaping from the trap
[6]. Therefore, the two-atom loss rate is proportional
to the number of two-atom combinations for the atoms
In terms of Γ2 the two-atom loss coeﬃ-
in the trap.
cient, the two-atom loss rate L2 is then given by L2 =
Γ2N (N − 1)/2.

The loading and loss processes occur randomly. Due to
random nature of these processes, it is more convenient to
treat the problem in terms of the atom number distribu-
tion function PN than to deal with the time variation of
the instantaneous atom number N itself. In order to un-
derstand the connection between time evolution of PN (t)
and that of N , let us suppose that we turn on the load-
ing process at time t = 0 and observe the atom number,
initially zero, afterwards. The atom number will change
randomly as depicted in Fig. 1, but the center of ﬂuctu-
ation will increase to a steady-state value determined by
the balance between the loading and loss processes.

If we repeat the observation inﬁnitely many times, each
observation will give a diﬀerent time sequence in detail.

FIG. 2: Connections among probabilities PN ’s. Loading pro-
cess N − 1 → N , one-atom loss process N + 1 → N and
two-atom loss process N + 2 → N result in an increase in PN
whereas loading process N → N + 1, one-atom loss process
N → N − 1 and two-atom loss process N → N − 2 cause a
reduction in PN .

III. WITHOUT TWO-ATOM LOSS TERMS

If a density of atoms in a trap is low enough, the col-
lisions among the trapped atoms can be neglected. If we
assume Γ2 = 0, Eq. (1) is simpliﬁed as

dPN
dt

= RPN −1 + Γ1(N + 1)PN +1 − (R + Γ1N )PN . (2)

This equation corresponds to the well-known birth-death
model [9]. In the steady state, we have dPN /dt = 0 for
all N and the solution is a Poisson distribution given by

PN =

1
N !
for all integers N ≥ 0 with ¯N = R/Γ1, the mean atom
number.

e− ¯N ¯N N

(3)

A rate equation for the ensemble-averaged atom num-
ber hN i in the trap can be derived from the Eq. (2).
Multiplication of N to the both sides of Eq. (2) followed
by summation over N gives a diﬀerential rate equation
for hN i:

ber constantly ﬂuctuates due to random loading and loss pro-
cesses. (b) Ensemble averaged atom number in time. (c) En-
semble averaged atom number distribution at various times.

However, if we average all of the observed time sequences
with the initial starting time aligned, we obtain a distri-
bution of atom numbers at any time t, corresponding
to PN (t), and a sequence of averaged atom number as
a function of time. Alternatively, we can replace the in-
ﬁnitely many observations with an ensemble of identically
prepared traps. The sequence of averaged atom number
is then an ensemble average of the atom number hN i.

It is shown that the time evolution of the ensemble-
averaged distribution PN (t) can be described the follow-
ing master equation:

for N = 0, 1, 2, . . . with a convention of P−1 = 0. Con-
nections among probabilities PN ’s are depicted in Fig.

In the steady state, dhN i/dt = 0 and thus we get hN i =
¯N = R/Γ1 from Eq. (4). Here the upper bar indicates
a time average in the steady state. From the properties
of the Poisson distribution we get the following relation
between the variance and the mean.

In the second line in Eq. (12), we used Eq. (4), which is
independent of the initial condition. By using the con-
ditions C(0) = hN 2it ≡ N 2 and ¯N = R/Γ1, we obtain

= R ¯N − Γ1N 2 = R ¯N − Γ1( ¯N 2 + ¯N ) = −R

In the steady state, the correlation function of the atom

number is deﬁned as follows.

C(τ ) = ¯N 2 + σ2e−Γ1τ ,

C(τ ) ≡ hN (t)N (t + τ )it

(8)

and therefore, the normalized correlation function is

(13)

(14)

where τ is a time delay and the notation h. . .it represents
a time average. Although the ensemble-averaged atom
number hN i does not change in the steady state, equal
to the mean atom number ¯N , the atom number N itself
is continuously ﬂuctuating around its mean.

We can replace the time average above with an ensem-
ble average. Let us denote the atom number at time t
in the ith ensemble member as N (i)(t). Then we can
rewrite the correlation function as

C(τ ) =

N (i)(0)N (i)(τ ) ,

(9)

i
X

where the summation over i is performed over all mem-
bers of the ensemble. We can regroup the ensemble into
sub-ensembles in such a way that the members in each
sub-ensemble have a common initial atom number N0.
Since N (i) values are distributed according to PN of Eq.
(3), we can rewrite the above equation as

C(τ ) =

(10)

where the summation over i′ represents a summation over
each sub-ensemble. All sub-ensembles are statistically
identical, described by the same master equation, Eq. (2).
Now, we can see that the quantity in [. . .] is nothing but
the ensemble-averaged atom number hN i at time t = τ
when its initial value is N0 at time t = 0. The correlation
function is then simpliﬁed as

C(τ ) =

N0PN0 hN (τ )i|hN (0)i=N0

(15)

The correlation function shows a decay behavior from
1 + 1/ ¯N to 1 with a characteristic correlation time tc =
1/Γ1. It is interesting to note that the atom-number cor-
relation function exhibits bunching, i.e., C(0) > C(τ ) for
τ > 0, when the atom number distribution is Poissonian
whereas a Poisson distribution for photon number does
not necessarily means bunching for a photon number cor-
relation function.

IV. WITH TWO-ATOM LOSS TERMS

If the density of atoms in a trap becomes higher, the
two-atom loss terms are no longer negligible, and thus
the full version of the master equation, Eq. (1), should
be considered. However, the full master equation cannot
be solved analytically. Instead, we rely on numerical so-
lutions, either by Monte-Carlo simulation or an iteration
method for given parameter values. Such numerical stud-
ies are discussed elsewhere [10]. In this work, we focus
on approximate solutions to the master equation.

The rate equation for hN i with the two-atom loss terms

can be derived from the master equation as

d
dt

hN i = R − Γ1hN i − Γ2hN (N − 1)i

(16)

In the steady state, we let dhN i/dt = 0. Diﬀerently
from the case of excluding two-atom loss terms, however,
we do not get any information about ¯N other than the
following relation between the variance and the mean.

Following the same line of reasoning from Eq. (8) to
Eq. (12) with the rate equation Eq. (16), we can obtain

presence of non-negligible two-atom loss terms as follows.

moments is obtained from the rate equation for hN 2i in
the steady state.

If Γ2 = 0, Eq. (21) reduces to Eq. (13).

The diﬀerential equation Eq. (18) cannot be solved ex-
actly because of the complexity in the last term. How-
ever,
in the limit of reasonably small two-atom loss,
Γ2 ≪ R, Γ1, the atom number distribution is approxi-
mately a Poisson distribution with a variance σ2 ≈ ¯N .
This is the most signiﬁcant approximation in our analy-
sis. The validity of this approximation will be discussed
in the next section. In this limit, the mean value ¯N can
be obtained from Eq. (17).

Our second approximation is that the correlation func-
tion is in the same form as that of Eq. (14) except for
the decay constant. This is a reasonable approximation
since the correlation function always starts from N 2 and
goes to ¯N 2 at inﬁnity. Therefore, we assume

C(τ ) ≃ ¯N 2 + σ2e−Γeff τ ,

(24)

where Γeﬀ is an eﬀective decay constant to be deter-
mined. It can be determined by Eq. (21).

FIG. 3: Comparison of atom-number correlation functions by
numerical simulation (solid curve) and by approximate for-
mula (dotted curve). Parameters are R=0.08, Γ1=0.04 and
the two-atom collision constant Γ2 is (a) 0.004, (b) 0.04 and
(c) 0.4, respectively. A dashed curve represents a correlation
function given by Eq. (15) neglecting two-atom loss. Grey
curves are the ﬁt given by the approximate formula with σ2
treated as a ﬁtting parameter. The resulting σ2
values are
0.94 ¯N , 0.78 ¯N and 0.50 ¯N for (a), (b) and (c), respectively.

V. COMPARISON WITH SIMULATION
RESULTS

In order to check the validity of our approximate for-
mulas Eqs. (23) and (28), we solve the master equa-
tion numerically and compare the results with the ap-
proximate formulas in Fig. 3. Under the condition of
Γ2 ≪ R, Γ1, Eq. (28) agrees well with the numerical re-
sults as shown in Fig. 3(a). Our approximation is valid in
this limit. As Γ2 is increased beyond this limit, however,
the approximation starts to deviate from the simulation

result as seen in Fig. 3(b), where we have Γ2 ∼ R, Γ1.
The approximation is still acceptable even under this
condition although not as good as in Fig. 3(a). The
deviation is severe in Fig. 3(c), under the condition of
Γ2 ≫ R, Γ1.

The failure of the approximation is mostly due to the
fact that the atom number distribution is assumed to be
a Poissonian. The atom number distribution function is
not well approximated by a Poisson distribution when Γ2
becomes comparable to and larger than R and Γ1, so the
assumption, ¯N ≈ σ2, fails. In general, the variance σ2
is smaller than the mean value ¯N . Consequently, when
τ = 0, the approximate result is always larger than the
true value.

(29)

If we treat σ2 in Eq. (27) as a ﬁtting parameter, we obtain

better agreement between the numerical results and the
approximate formula even for Γ2 & Γ1, R. For example,
the grey curves in Fig. 3 are the ﬁt given by Eq. (27),
agreeing well with the numerical results.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have derived approximate formulas for the mean
atom number and the atom-number correlation function
in the limit of reasonably small two-atom collision com-
pared to the one-atom collision and the loading rates.
The validity of the approximate formulas was conﬁrmed
by comparing them with numerical solutions.

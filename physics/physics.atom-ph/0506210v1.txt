A calculation of the one-loop self-energy and vacuum-polarization corrections to the hyperﬁne splitting of the
1s and 2s states in light H-like ions is carried out to all orders in the parameter Zα. Using the known values for
the Zα-expansion coefﬁcients, the numerical data obtained are extrapolated from Z = 5 and higher to Z = 0,
1, and 2, with the resulting accuracy being signiﬁcantly better than in previous evaluations. Our calculation
shifts the theoretical value of the normalized difference of the 1s and 2s hyperﬁne-structure intervals in 3He+
by 0.056 kHz and improves its accuracy.

Introduction

Hyperﬁne splitting of the ground state in light H-like sys-
tems, such as hydrogen, deuterium, tritium, and helium-3 ion,
has long been known experimentally with extremely high pre-
cision. The present-day theory of the ground-state hyperﬁne
structure (hfs) is still far behind the experiment, due to a rela-
tively large contribution of the nuclear-structure effects, which
cannot be accurately calculated at present. One of the possi-
bilities to overcome this difﬁculty [1] is to study the normal-
ized difference ∆21 = 8 ν2s − ν1s, where ν1s and ν2s are the
1s and the 2s hfs interval, respectively. A large class of cor-
rections to ν1s and ν2s (among them, all lowest-order nuclear
effects) are proportional to the nonrelativistic electron density
at the position of the nucleus (r = 0) and, therefore, do not
contribute to the difference ∆21. Consequently, the theoret-
ical study of this difference can be performed up to a much
higher accuracy than that of ν1s and ν2s separately.

The experimental value of the difference ∆21 is obtained
by combining results of two independent measurements of ν1s
and ν2s and is known less precisely than ν1s. The best accu-
racy is obtained for the helium-3 ion in a combination of two
relatively old results [2, 3],

∆21(3He+) = 1 189.979 (71) kHz .

(1)

Recent progress was achieved in the measurement of ν2s in
hydrogen [4] and deuterium [5], which signiﬁcantly improved
the corresponding experimental values for the difference ∆21.
Theory of hfs and, speciﬁcally, of the difference ∆21 in
light H-like atoms has recently been examined in detail in
Ref. [6]. It is demonstrated that one of the major uncertain-
ties in the theoretical prediction of ∆21(3He+) stems from the
one-loop self-energy correction. The self-energy correction is
also responsible for a signiﬁcant part of the theoretical uncer-
tainty for the ground-state hyperﬁne splitting in muonium [7].
The goal of the present investigation is to improve the nu-
merical accuracy of the one-loop QED correction for the 1s
and 2s states in light H-like atoms. Our consideration will
be carried out to all orders in the parameter Zα (Z is the

nuclear charge number and α is the ﬁne-structure constant).
All-order calculations of the self-energy hfs correction in H-
like ions have been previously performed by numerous au-
thors [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Different evaluations are
generally in good agreement (except for the ﬁrst two calcula-
tions, see a discussion in Ref. [14]). For high- and middle-Z
ions, results for this correction can be presently considered
as well established at the level of the experimental interest.
In the low-Z region, however, the experimental accuracy is
much higher and technical problems encountered in all-order
calculations are more demanding than for higher-Z ions. It
would be clearly preferable to perform a direct all-order cal-
culation for Z = 1 and 2 with an accuracy signiﬁcantly higher
than the one obtained from the Zα expansion, as it was done
for the Lamb shift [16]. However, such a project has not been
realized yet. Blundell et al. [12] obtained the higher-order (in
Zα) contribution to the 1s self-energy correction for Z = 1
by extrapolating their numerical results for higher Z. Similar
procedure was employed in the investigation by two of us [14]
for the self-energy correction to the 1s and 2s hfs intervals for
Z = 1 and 2.

The vacuum-polarization hfs correction was evaluated to all
orders in Zα in Refs. [8, 17, 18] (without the magnetic-loop
Wichmann-Kroll correction) and in Refs. [13, 19] (complete
calculations). However, the above studies were mainly con-
cerned with high- and middle-Z ions, so that little information
was provided about the behavior of the Wichmann-Kroll part
of the vacuum-polarization correction in the low-Z region.

In the present work, we perform a calculation of the one-
loop self-energy and vacuum-polarization corrections to the
1s and 2s hfs intervals in H-like ions. The paper is orga-
nized as follows. In Sec. I we evaluate the self-energy correc-
tion by employing the additional-subtraction scheme [20] that
improves the convergence properties of the resulting partial-
wave expansion.
In this way, we signiﬁcantly increase the
accuracy of the numerical results for Z ≥ 5 as compared to
the previous evaluations. The vacuum-polarization correction
is evaluated in Sec. II. The higher-order one-loop QED con-
tribution is inferred from our all-order results in Sec. III by
subtracting the known terms of the Zα expansion. Finally, we

discuss the experimental consequences of our calculation.

I. SELF-ENERGY CORRECTION

In this section we describe the evaluation of the self-energy
hfs correction without any expansion in Zα. We start with
general formulas for the self-energy correction in the presence
of an additional perturbing potential δV . To the ﬁrst order
in δV , the self-energy correction is given by the sum of the
irreducible, the reducible, and the vertex correction [21],

∆ESE = ∆Eir + ∆Ered + ∆Ever .

(2)

The irreducible part arises through a perturbation of the wave
function,

∆Eir = hδa|γ0

Σ(εa)|ai + ha|γ0

Σ(εa)|δai ,

Σ = Σ − δm, δm is the one-loop mass counterterm, Σ

The self-energy correction to hfs is given by the above for-
mulas, in which we should assume the perturbing potential to

netic moment is denoted by µ),

and MF is its projection. Radial integrations over the nuclear
coordinates can easily be performed already in the general ex-
pressions. One can show that formulas (3)-(7) yield correc-
tions to hfs if we employ the perturbing interaction in the form

A.

Irreducible part

As follows from Eq. (3), evaluation of the irreducible part
of the self-energy hfs correction implies a calculation of a
non-diagonal matrix element of the self-energy function and,
therefore, is very similar to the evaluation of the ﬁrst-order
self-energy correction to the Lamb shift. Since our present
approach to this problem is somewhat different from the stan-
dard potential-expansion method, we now give a short de-
scription of the scheme used for the evaluation of a self-energy
matrix element.

Ultraviolet divergencies in the self-energy function (4) are
traditionally isolated by separating the ﬁrst two terms in the
expansion of the bound-electron propagator G in terms of the
binding potential V ,

G(E, x1, x2) = G(0)(E, x1, x2) + G(1)(E, x1, x2)

function, G(1) is the ﬁrst-order expansion term

G(1)(E, x1, x2) =

(13)
and G(2+) is the remainder. Representing G in the form (12)
leads to splitting the matrix element of the self-energy func-
tion into the zero-potential, one-potential, and many-potential
parts (see Refs. [22, 23, 24] for details),

with the mass-counterterm part naturally ascribed to the zero-
potential term.

The integration contour CLH consists of two parts, the low-
energy (CL) and the high-energy (CH ) one. The low-energy
part extends from ε0 − i0 to −i0 on the lower bank of the
branch cut of the photon propagator and from i0 to ε0 + i0 on
the upper bank of the cut. In order to avoid the appearance of
poles of the electron propagator near the integration contour,
each part of CL is bent into the complex plane if the calcula-
tion is performed for an excited state. The high-energy part of
the contour is CH = (ε0 − i∞, ε0 − i0] + [ε0 + i0, ε0 + i∞).
The parameter ε0 of the contour is chosen arbitrary from the
interval ε0 ∈ (εa − ε1s, 1 + εa), where ε1s is the ground-state
energy.

The function G(2+) = G − G(0) − G(1) that enters Eq. (15)
is not known in its closed form at present and, consequently,
an evaluation of the many-potential term has to be performed
by expanding G (and, therefore, G(2+)) into eigenfunctions
of the Dirac angular momentum with the eigenvalue κ. This
expansion will be referred to as the partial-wave expansion
in the following. The convergence properties of this expan-
sion are of crucial importance for the numerical evaluation of
the self-energy correction. In our previous investigation [20],
it was demonstrated that the convergence rate of the partial-
wave expansion could be signiﬁcantly enhanced by separating
from ∆E many a part that is calculated in a closed form.

It was shown that in the region x1 ≈ x2 the function G(2+)

could be approximated by a simpler function G(2+)
(E, x1, x2) = G(0)(E + Ω, x1, x2)

(17)

The above approximation can be obtained from the exact ex-
pression for G(2+) by neglecting the commutators [V, G(0)]
to all orders. The function G(2+)
is expressed in terms of the
a
free Green function and can be easily evaluated in a closed
form. We thus write ∆E many as a sum of two terms,

∆E many = ∆E sub

many + ∆E remd
many .

(18)

The subtraction term ∆E sub
many is obtained from the high-
energy part of Eq. (15) by the substitution G(2+) → G(2+)
.
The second term ∆E remd
many is the remainder. The subtraction
term is evaluated numerically in its closed form (i.e., without
any partial-wave expansion), whereas the remainder yields a
rapidly converging partial-wave expansion; for the details of
the evaluation see Ref. [20].

B. Reducible part

The reducible part is deﬁned by Eq. (6). Using the deﬁ-
nition of the self-energy function and employing the contour
CLH for the integration over ω, we write the expression in the

Ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) divergences present in this
expression can be conveniently isolated by separating the
Green function G into 3 parts,

(20)

(21)

and µa denotes the momentum projection of the states ψa in
this expression. The terms on the right-hand-side of Eq. (20)
substituted in Eq. (19) give rise to the splitting of ∆Eir, re-
spectively, into 3 parts:

∆Ered = ∆E(0)

red + ∆E(a)

red + ∆E many

red

.

(22)

In this sum, the term ∆E(0)
red contains all UV divergences. It is
calculated in momentum space in a way similar to that for
the zero-potential part of the ﬁrst-order self-energy correc-
tion. UV-divergent terms are covariantly isolated; they dis-
appear when combined with the free-propagator contribution
in the vertex part. The term ∆E(a)
red contains all IR divergences
present in the reducible part. (IR divergences of this type are
sometimes also termed as the reference-state singularities).
These divergences are regularized by employing the photon
propagator with a ﬁnite photon mass µ. The limit µ → 0
can be taken when ∆E(a)
red is combined with the correspond-
ing contribution from the vertex part.

The term ∆E many

is ﬁnite. Contributions of such type are
frequently encountered in all-order QED calculations. Usu-
ally, they are evaluated in coordinate space after expanding
into an inﬁnite partial-wave series. In the present investiga-
tion, we modify the standard scheme in order to achieve a bet-
ter convergence of the partial-wave expansion, analogously to
that for the irreducible part. We thus separate ∆E many
into
two parts,

las are immediately obtained from the corresponding expres-
sions for the subtraction term for the ﬁrst-order self-energy
correction [20]. The remainder term is calculated by a partial-
wave expansion. Due to the additional subtraction in the high-
energy part, the convergence properties of this partial-wave
expansion are much better than in the standard approach.

where a′ and a′′ denote the intermediate states with εn = εa
and with the momentum projection µa′ and µa′′ , respectively.
The integration over ω can be carried out analytically, which
leads to an explicitly ﬁnite result. Sometimes it is more con-
venient to calculate this contribution directly according to
Eq. (28) (as long as the contour CLH is employed for the in-
tegration over ω, this expression is suitable for the numerical
evaluation).

ver

The third term ∆E many

does not contain any divergences
and is calculated in coordinate space after expanding into a
partial-wave series. We note that the additional subtraction,
similar to the one introduced for the reducible part, does not
improve the convergence properties of the partial-wave expan-
sion in this case. This is due to the fact that a signiﬁcant contri-
bution to the partial-wave expansion terms originates from the
ﬁrst-order commutator [V, G(0)]. In order to achieve a signif-
icant improvement, one needs to separate the complete con-
tribution of the vertex with one magnetic and one Coulomb
interaction. Such contribution was evaluated in a closed form
for the self-energy correction to the g-factor [25, 26] using
the explicit form of the interaction with the constant mag-
netic ﬁeld. In the case of the self-energy hfs correction, we
are presently unable to obtain a closed representation for this
term. Nevertheless, the partial-wave expansion for ∆E many
is converging signiﬁcantly faster than that for ∆E many
and
∆E many
, so that the enhanced convergence achieved for the
red
irreducible and reducible parts results ﬁnally in a signiﬁcant
improvement of the total accuracy of the calculation.

bined with the corresponding contribution from the reducible

gent. In order to retain its ﬁnite part, we consider it together

model and in the Feynman gauge. In Table II we list the ﬁnal
results for the self-energy hfs correction for H-like ions with Z
varying from 5 to 30. A comparison of the results of different
theoretical evaluations for this correction in the low-Z region
is given in Table III.

As can be seen from Table III, the present calculation im-
proves the numerical accuracy of the self-energy hfs correc-
tion by about an order of magnitude for the 1s state and even
more for the 2s state, as compared to our previous calcula-
tion [14]. This progress is due to the additional subtraction
scheme employed in the present work for the evaluation of
the irreducible and reducible parts of the correction. In or-
der to illustrate the improvement in the convergence proper-
ties of the partial-wave expansion introduced by this scheme,
in Figs. 1 and 2 we plot (in the decimal logarithmic scale) the
dependence of the absolute value of the individual terms of
the partial-wave series on the expansion parameter |κ| within

the vertex function.) Figs. 1 and 2 represent this comparison
for the irreducible and the reducible part, respectively.

As a result of the improvement achieved, we were able to
eliminate completely the uncertainty arising from termination
of the partial-wave expansion in the irreducible and reducible
parts. Still, there remains the partial-wave expansion of the
many-potential vertex term ∆E many
, which has to be termi-
nated and properly extrapolated to inﬁnity. (In actual calcula-
tions, the summation was terminated at |κ| = 40). The error
due to this extrapolation yields one of the main uncertainties
of our numerical evaluation (the other source of the uncer-
tainty is the stability of numerical integrations.) Fortunately,
the partial-wave expansion of ∆E many
is monotonic and rel-
atively well-converging (not worse than 1/|κ|3 for all Z ≥ 5),
and so the uncalculated tail of the expansion can be estimated
reasonably well.

the present work (open dots). Plotted are the contributions to the
function Dn(Zα) as a function of the absolute value of the relativis-
tic angular momentum parameter κ. A discontinuity of the curve on
the upper graph around |κ| = 19 is due to the change of the sign of
the contributions to D1(Zα).

II. VACUUM-POLARIZATION CORRECTION

into two parts,

The vacuum-polarization hfs correction can be conve-
niently split
the so-called electric- and
magnetic-loop contributions. The electric-loop part originates
from the diagrams with the hfs interaction attached to the ex-
ternal electron line, whereas the magnetic-loop one comes
from the diagram with the hfs interaction attached to the
vacuum-polarization loop. These contributions are also tra-
ditionally separated into the Uehling and Wichmann-Kroll
(WK) parts. The WK part is suppressed by a factor of (Zα)2
as compared to the Uehling contribution and can often be re-
garded as a small correction for low-Z ions.

can be found, e.g., in Refs. [13, 19].
In the case of the
point nucleus, this contribution was evaluated also analyti-
cally [6, 27]. For completeness, we re-calculate it in the
present work. The corresponding contributions to the higher-
order remainder F VP
n (Zα) for the point nuclear model are
listed in the ﬁrst and the second columns of Table IV for the
1s and 2s states, respectively. The results presented are in
agreement with the previous calculations of this correction.

The WK part of the vacuum-polarization hfs correction
is more difﬁcult to calculate. Especially, this refers to the
magnetic-loop WK contribution. As outlined in Ref. [19],
this correction is divergent in the point-dipole approximation
for the nuclear magnetization distribution. A ﬁnite result for
this correction is obtained if an extended nuclear magnetiza-
tion distribution is employed. It should be also taken into ac-
count that the magnetic-loop WK interaction contributes to
the measured value of the nuclear magnetic moment [28]. In
order to prevent double-counting, the corresponding contribu-
tion should be subtracted from the magnetic-loop WK part of
the vacuum-polarization hfs correction. Practical calculations
[13, 19] show that, after such a subtraction, the magnetic-loop
WK correction depends weakly on details of the nuclear mag-
netization distribution and has a ﬁnite limit in the point-dipole
approximation.

The results of our numerical evaluation of the electric- and
magnetic-loop WK contributions for the 1s and 2s states of
light H-like ions are listed in Table IV, in terms of the higher-
order remainder F VP
n (Zα). The electric-loop WK correction
was calculated for the point nuclear model by employing the
analytical-approximation formulas for the WK potential from
Ref. [29]. The relative accuracy of this approximation is con-
sidered by the authors to be not worse than 10−4 for all Z
up to Zα = 0.95. As an independent test of the accuracy
of this approximation in the low-Z region, we checked that
it reproduces well the ﬁrst two terms of the Zα expansion of
the WK correction to the Lamb shift. The magnetic-loop WK
correction was calculated for the point-dipole nuclear mag-
netization model by using a code developed in our previous
investigation [19]. A comparison given in Table IV demon-
strates good agreement of our numerical values with the 1s
results of Ref. [13] for Z = 10 and 18.

III. HIGHER-ORDER ONE-LOOP QED CORRECTION

One of the main goals of our investigation is to improve the
accuracy of the one-loop QED correction for Z = 1 and 2,
these being the most interesting cases from the experimental
point of view. The present approach does not employ the Zα
expansion and, therefore, our numerical results do not suffer
from omission of the higher-order terms, as is the case with
the perturbative Zα-expansion approach. But on the other
hand, technical problems do not presently allow us to perform
a direct numerical evaluation for Z = 1 and 2 with a sufﬁcient
accuracy. In the present work, we employ an indirect method
used previously in Refs. [12, 14]. By subtracting the known
terms of the Zα expansion from the all-order results for higher
values of Z, we identify the higher-order remainder and then

For the a30 term, there is a preliminary result [30] for the 1s
state, a30(1s) = −15.9(1.6), and a partial result [6, 31] for
the difference ∆21, a30(2s) − a30(1s) = 7.92.

The higher-order self-energy remainder F SE

can be in-
ferred from our all-order numerical data. The correspond-
ing results for the function F SE
(Zα) and the difference
1
(Zα) − F SE
21 (Zα) ≡ F SE
F SE
(Zα) are plotted on the up-
1
per graphs of Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. We note that both

n

2

1

(Zα) and F SE
the F SE
21 (Zα) functions have a rapidly vary-
ing structure in the low-Z region.
In order to demonstrate
this more clearly, we subtract their “linear” part (obtained by
a global linear ﬁt), with the corresponding plots presented
on the middle graphs of Figs. 3 and 4. The behavior ob-
served apparently indicates that the logarithmic term to order
α(Zα)4EF enters with a large coefﬁcient, which complicates
extrapolation considerably.

Now we would like to extrapolate our results for the higher-
order remainder to the lower values of Z, namely Z = 0, 1,
and 2. For this purpose we employ a procedure similar to the
one recently described in detail in Ref. [32]. The extrapolated
value of a function at Z = z0 is obtained in two steps. First
we apply an (exact) linear ﬁt to each two consecutive points
from our data set and store the resulting value at Z = z0 as a
function of the average abscissa of the points involved in the
ﬁt. Then we perform a global parabolic least-squares ﬁt to the
set of data obtained and take the ﬁtted value at Z = z0 as a
ﬁnal result.

We tested this procedure for variation of the logarithmic
contribution to the next-to-leading order and found it rather
stable. However, in order to take into account the presence
of such contribution explicitly, we modify the procedure de-
scribed above as following. First, we approximate our numer-
ical data by a function

f (Z) = c0 + (Zα) [c1 ln(Zα) + c2 + (Zα) c3]

(45)

with free coefﬁcients ci, which are determined by a least-
squares ﬁt similar to the one described in Ref. [33]. Then,
we use the values obtained for c1 and c2 in order to deﬁne a
modiﬁed higher-order remainder function as

n (Zα) = F SE
F SE

n (Zα) − (Zα) [c1 ln(Zα) + c2] .

(46)

e

The numerical results for this function are plotted on the lower
graphs of Figs. 3 and 4. The function
is much ﬂatter in
the low-Z region than F SE
and, therefore, is more suitable
for the extrapolation. We obtain our ﬁnal results extrapolating

tained for the function F SE

quence of the logarithmic contribution to the next-to-leading

taken from Table IV for Z = 1 and 2 and from Refs. [6, 27]
for Z = 0. The electric-loop WK correction for Z = 1 and 2
was calculated directly in Sec. II; the corresponding numerical
value for Z = 0 was obtained by a simple extrapolation. Ex-
trapolation was also employed in order to obtain the results for
the magnetic-loop WK part of the vacuum-polarization cor-
rection presented in the table. The error bars speciﬁed are ob-
tained under the assumption that the logarithmic contribution
to the next-to-leading order enters with a coefﬁcient of about
2.

We now turn to the experimental consequences of our cal-
culation. As demonstrated in Ref. [6], the higher-order self-
energy correction is one of the major sources of uncertainty of
the theoretical prediction for the normalized difference of the
hfs intervals ∆21 = 8 ν2s − ν1s for the 3He+ ion. Our present
calculation changes the theoretical value of this correction by
−0.056 kHz (as compared to our former result [14]) and im-
proves its accuracy by a factor of 2. The resulting value of

the one-loop QED contribution that incorporates all orders in
Zα starting with the constant term to order α(Zα)3EF for
the 3He+ ion is given in the ﬁrst line of Table VI. In the next
lines of the table, we give the total theoretical value for the
difference ∆21(3He+) taken from Ref. [6], this value modi-
ﬁed by the present calculation, and the corresponding experi-
mental result. As can be seen from the table, our calculation
increases the deviation of the theoretical prediction from the
experimental value from 0.9 σ to 1.6 σ.

It should be noted that our numerical results for all correc-
tions at Z = 1, except for the one for the magnetic-loop WK
contribution, can be directly applied to the hyperﬁne splitting
in muonium. Our calculation of the magnetic-loop WK cor-
rection does not hold for muonium since it involves a reg-
ularization by an extended magnetization distribution of the
nucleus and a subtraction of the related contribution to the
measured value of the nuclear magnetic moment. In the case
of muonium, the nucleus is substituted by a point-like muon

and the regularization should be performed by a ﬁnite mass of
the muon rather than by a ﬁnite size.

IV. SUMMARY

In the present investigation, we carried out an all-order (in
Zα) calculation of the one-loop QED correction to the hyper-
ﬁne splitting of the 1s and 2s states in light H-like ions. This
calculation signiﬁcantly improved the accuracy of this correc-
tion, as compared to the previous evaluations. By subtracting
the known terms of the Zα expansion and extrapolating the
remainder to lower values of Z, we obtained the results for
the higher-order remainder for Z = 0, 1, and 2. Our calcu-
lation shifts the theoretical value of the normalized difference
∆21 of the 1s and 2s hfs intervals in 3He+ by 0.056 kHz and
slightly improves its accuracy.

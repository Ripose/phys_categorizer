Abstract

The values of ion-atom ionization cross sections are frequently needed for many applications

that utilize the propagation of fast ions through matter. When experimental data and theoret-

ical calculations are not available, approximate formulas are frequently used. This paper brieﬂy

summarizes the most important theoretical results and approaches to cross section calculations in

order to place the discussion in historical perspective and oﬀer a concise introduction to the topic.

Based on experimental data and theoretical predictions, a new ﬁt for ionization cross sections is

proposed. The range of validity and accuracy of several frequently used approximations (classical

trajectory, the Born approximation, and so forth) are discussed using, as examples, the ionization

cross sections of hydrogen and helium atoms by various fully stripped ions.

INTRODUCTION

Ion-atom ionizing collisions play an important role in many applications such as heavy

ion inertial fusion [1], collisional and radiative processes in the Earth’s upper atmosphere [2],

ion-beam lifetimes in accelerators [3], atomic spectroscopy [4], and ion stopping in matter

[5], and are of considerable interest in atomic physics [6]. The recent resurgence of interest in

charged particle beam transport in background plasma is brought about by the recognition

that plasma can be used as a magnetic lens. Applications of the plasma lens ranging from

heavy ion fusion to high energy lepton colliders are discussed in Refs. [6-10]. In particular,

both heavy ion fusion and high energy physics applications involve the transport of positive

charges in plasma: partially stripped heavy elements for heavy ion fusion; positrons for

electron-positrons colliders [9]; and high-density laser-produced proton beams for the fast

ignition of inertial conﬁnement fusion targets [11].

To estimate the ionization and stripping rates of fast ions propagating through gas or

plasma, the values of ion-atom ionization cross sections are necessary. In contrast to the

electron [12] and proton [13, 14, 15] ionization cross sections, where experimental data or

theoretical calculations exist for practically any ion and atom, the knowledge of ionization

cross sections by fast complex ions and atoms is far from complete [16, 17, 18, 19]. When

experimental data and theoretical calculations are not available, approximate formulas are

frequently used.

The raison d’etre for this paper are the frequent requests that we have had from colleagues

for a paper describing the regions of validity of diﬀerent approximations and scaling laws

in the calculation of ion- atom stripping cross sections. The experimental data on stripping

cross sections at low projectile energy were collected in the late 1980s, while comprehensive

quantum mechanical simulations were performed in the late 1990s. Having in hand both

new experimental data and simulation results enabled us to identify regions of validity of

diﬀerent approximations and propose a new scaling law, which is the subject of the present

paper.

The most popular formula for ionization cross sections was proposed by Gryzinski [20].

The web of science search engine [21] shows 457 citations of the paper, and most of the

citing papers use Gryzinski’s formula to evaluate the cross sections. In this approach, the

cross section is speciﬁed by multiplication of a scaling factor and the unique function of the

2

projectile velocity normalized to the orbital electron velocity. The popularity of Gryzinski’s

formula is based on the simplicity of the calculation, notwithstanding the fact that his

formula is not accurate at small energies.

Another ﬁt, proposed by Gillespie, gives results close to Gryzinski’s formula at large

energies, and makes corrections to Gryzinski’s formula at small energies [22]. Although

more accurate, Gillespie’s ﬁt is not frequently used in applications, because it requires a

knowledge of ﬁtting parameters not always known a priori.

In this paper, we propose a new ﬁt formula for ionization cross section which has no ﬁtting

parameters. The formula is checked against available experimental data and theoretical

predictions. Note that previous scaling laws either used ﬁtting parameters or actually did

not match experiments for a wide range of projectile velocities. We also brieﬂy review the

most important theoretical results and approaches to cross section calculations in order to

place the discussion in historical perspective and oﬀer nonspecialists a concise introduction

to the topic.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec.II we give a brief overview of key

theoretical results and experimental data. Further details of the theoretical models are

presented in Appendices A-C. The new proposed ﬁt formula for ionization cross section is

presented in Sec.III, including a detailed comparison with experimental data, and in Sec.IV

the theoretical justiﬁcation for the new ﬁt formula is discussed.

II. BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE THEORETICAL MODELS AND EXPERIMEN-

TAL DATA FOR IONIZATION CROSS SECTIONS

There are several theoretical approaches to cross section calculations. These include:

classical calculations that make use of a classical trajectory and the atomic electron velocity

distribution functions given by quantum mechanics [this approach is frequently referred to

as classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC)]; quantum mechanical calculations based on

Born, eikonal or quasiclassical approximations, and so forth [16, 17, 18, 19]. All approaches

are computationally intensive and the error and range of validity are diﬃcult to estimate in

most cases. Therefore, diﬀerent ﬁttings and scalings for cross sections are frequently used

in practical applications.

Most scalings were developed using theories and simulations based on classical mechanics.

3

Classical trajectory calculations are easier to perform compared with quantum mechanical

calculations. Moreover, in some cases the CTMC calculations yield results very close to

the quantum-mechanical calculations [23, 24, 25, 26]. The reason for similar results lies

in the fact that the Rutherford scattering cross section is identical in both classical and

quantum-mechanical derivations [27]. Therefore, when an ionizing collision is predominantly

a consequence of the electron scattering at small impact parameters close to the nucleus,

the quantum mechanical uncertainty in the scattering angle is small compared with the

angle itself, and the classical calculation can yield an accurate description [28, 29, 30].

Whereas in the opposite limit, when an ionizing collision is predominantly a consequence

of the electron scattering at large impact parameters far from the nucleus, the quantum

mechanical uncertainty in the scattering angle is large compared with the angle itself, and

the classical calculation can remarkably fail in computing the ionization cross section [31, 32].

In the present analysis, we consider ﬁrst the stripping or ionization cross section of the

hydrogen-like electron orbits (for example one-electron ions), with nucleus of charge ZT ,

colliding with a fully stripped ion of charge Zp. Subsequently, we show that the approach

can be generalized with reasonable accuracy for any electron orbital, making use of the

ionization potential of the electron orbitals. Because diﬀerent terminology is used in the

literature, we call a stripping collision a collision in which the fast ion loses an electron in

a collision with a stationary target ion or atom (in the laboratory frame); and we call an

ionizing collision a collision in which a fast ion ionizes a stationary target ion or atom [16].

Both cases are physically equivalent to each other by changing the frame of reference, and

further consideration can be given in the frame of the atom or ion being ionized.

Atomic units are used throughout this paper with e = ~ = me = 1, which corresponds

·

is the Rydberg energy. The normalizing coeﬃcients are kept in all equations for robust

application of the formulas. For eﬃcient manipulation of the formulas it is worth noting

that the normalized projectile ion velocity is v/v0 = 0.2

E[keV /amu], where E is energy per

nucleon in keV /amu. Therefore, 25keV /amu corresponds to the atomic velocity scale. Some

p

papers express the normalized velocity v/v0 as βα, where β = v/c, and v0/c = α = 1/137.

Here, c is the speed of light, and α is the ﬁne structure constant.

For a one-electron ion, the typical scale for the electron orbital velocity is vnl = v0ZT .

4

Here, n, l is the standard notation for the main quantum number and the orbital angular

momentum [27]. The collision dynamics is very diﬀerent depending on whether v is smaller

or larger than vnl.

A. Behavior of cross sections at large projectile velocities v > vnl

If v >> vnl, the electron interaction with the projectile ion occurs for a very short time

and the interaction time decreases as the velocity increases. Therefore, the ionization cross

section also decreases as the velocity increases. In the opposite case v << vnl, the electron

circulation around the target nucleus is much faster than the interaction time, and the

momentum transfer from the projectile ion to the electron averages out due to the fast

circulation. Thus, the cross section decreases as the projectile velocity decreases. This is
why the cross section typically has a maximum at v = vmax ∼
vmax also depends on the charge of the projectile.

vnl, but as we shall see below,

1. Thompson’s treatment

In the ﬁrst treatment, Thompson calculated the ionization cross section in the limit

v >> vnl [33]. This treatment neglected completely the orbital motion of the target electrons

and assumed a straight-line trajectory of the projectile. In this approximation, the velocity

kick acquired by the electron during the collision is entirely in the direction perpendicular

to the ion trajectory, because the ﬁnal action of the force along the trajectory cancels out

due to symmetry, i.e., the electron velocity change during the approaching phase is equal

to minus the electron velocity change during the departing phase. The momentum acquired

by the electron ( me∆v) from passing by the projectile moving with the speed v and impact

parameter ρ is given by the integral over time of the force perpendicular to ion trajectory

F⊥ = e2Zpρ/(ρ2 + v2t2)3/2, where t = 0 corresponds to the distance of the closest approach.

Time integration of the force yields

∆v(ρ) =

2e2Zp
mevρ

.

(1)

From Eq.(1) it follows that only collisions with suﬃciently small impact parameters result in

ionization. The minimum impact parameter for ionization of an initially stationary electron

5

(ρmin) is me∆v(ρmin)2/2 = Inl. During a collision with impact parameter ρmin the energy
transfer from the projectile to the electron is equal to the ionization potential Inl = Z 2
or ∆v(ρmin) = vnl. Substitution of Eq.(1) gives the total ionization cross section πρ2

Similarly, Eq.(2) can be derived by averaging the Rutherford cross section over all scattering

angles leading to ionization. Although the ﬁrst derivation of Eq.(2) was done by Thompson

[33] the formula is frequently referred to as the Bohr formula [16].

2. Gerjuoy’s treatment

The following treatments account for the eﬀect of ﬁnite electron orbital velocity. The

most complete and accurate calculations were done by Gerjuoy [34]. He calculated the

diﬀerential cross section dσ/d∆E(ve, v, ∆E) of energy transfer ∆E in the collision between

the projectile ion and a free electron (the target atomic potential was neglected) with given

initial speed ve (and arbitrary direction), by averaging the Rutherford cross section over

all orientations of electron orbital velocity ve. The total cross section is then calculated by

integration over the energy transfer for energies larger than the ionization potential, and

weighted by the electron velocity distribution function f (ve). This gives

< mev2

ionization potential Knl = Inl [27], and Bnl = 1. The Bnl factors are introduced to account

for the diﬀerence in the electron velocity distribution functions (EVDF) from the EVDF of

the hydrogen-like electron orbitals. The data for Knl are calculated for many atoms in Ref.
[35]. For example, the average kinetic energy for the helium atom is Knl ≡
1.43E0, whereas Inl = 0.91E0, and therefore BHe = 1.22. That is the reason that accounting

for the ﬁnite orbital electron velocity gives a cross section which is 5/3 times larger than the

Bohr formula in Eq.(2). This is a consequence of the fact that for an electron with nonzero

velocity less energy transfer is required for ionization.

Although a microcanonical distribution provides the same velocity distribution as in quan-

tum theory for hydrogen-like shells, this is not the case for other electron shells. Moreover,

the spatial distribution of the charge density is poorly approximated even for hydrogen,

vanishing identically for r > 2a0 rather than decreasing exponentially [18]. Substituting the

general diﬀerential cross section dσ/d∆E(ve, v, ∆E) from Eq.(A3) of Appendix A and the

3. Bethe’s treatment

The classical calculations underestimate the cross sections for very high projectile ve-

locities v >> vnl. The scattering angle of the projectile due to collision with the target

atom is of order θc = ∆p/Mv, where ∆p is the momentum transfer in the collision, and M

is the mass of the projectile particle. The minimum energy transfer from the projectile is
determined by the ionization potential, with ∆E = v∆p > Inl, and ∆p > ∆pmin ≡

that ∆pmin ≡
∆pmin, it follows that θc = ∆p/Mv << θd = ~/(Mvanl). Therefore, the

Bethe made use of the Born approximation of quantum mechanics to calculate cross

sections [38] (see Appendix B for details). This yields for v >> vnl

(11)

(cid:20)
If the projectile speed is much larger than the electron orbital velocity v >> vnl, the loga-

(cid:21)

v
vnl (cid:19)

rithmic term on the right-hand side of Eq.(11) contributes substantially to the cross section,

and as a result the quantum mechanical calculation in Eq.(11) gives a larger cross section

than the classical trajectory treatment in Eq.(6). The quantum mechanical cross section

is larger than the classical trajectory cross section due to the contribution of large impact

parameters (ρ) to the quantum-mechanical cross section, where the ionization is forbidden in

classical mechanics because the energy transfer calculated by classical mechanics is less than

the ionization potential [∆E = v∆pc(ρ) < Inl, where ∆pc is the momentum transfer given by

classical mechanics in Eq.(1)]. However, ionization is possible due to diﬀraction in quantum

mechanics [39]. Moreover, integration over these large impact parameters where the ion-

ization is forbidden in classical mechanics, contributes considerably to the total ionization

cross section (see Appendix B for further details).

4. Gryzinski’s treatment

Gryzinski attempted to obtain the ionization cross sections using only classical mechanics

similarly to Gerjuoy. But, in order to match the asymptotic behavior of the Bethe formula

in Eq.(11) at large projectile velocities, Gryzinski assumed an artiﬁcial electron velocity

distribution function (EVDF) instead of the correct EVDF in Eq.(8) [20], i.e.,

(12)

The ionization cross section was calculated by averaging the Rutherford cross section over

all possible electron velocities, similar to the Gerjuoy calculation in Eq.(3), but was less

accurate for small velocities v < vnl. The eﬀect of using the EVDF in Eq.

(12) is to

populate the EVDF tail with a much larger fraction of high-energy electrons with ve >> vnl,

∼

v >> vnl, Gerjuoy’s calculation of the diﬀerential cross section dσ/d∆E(ve, v, ∆E) of energy

transfer ∆E is similar to Gryzinski’s. Therefore, we can substitute Eq.(12) into Eqs.(5)

and (4). Because in the limit v >> vnl the ionization cross section is proportional to
the average electron kinetic energy < mev2

e /2 > [Eq.(6)], and the average kinetic energy

diverges, it follows that a small population of high-speed electrons contributes considerably

to the cross section. Using the general expression for dσ/d∆E(ve, v, ∆E) avoids singularity

and yields the logarithmic term in the ionization cross section similar to the Bethe formula in

Eq.(11). After a number of additional simpliﬁcations and assumptions, Gryzinski suggested

an approximation for the cross section in the form given by Eq.(10) with [20]

(17)

Therefore, the Gryzinski formula can be viewed as a ﬁt to the Bethe formula at large

velocities v >> vnl with some rather arbitrary continuation to small velocities v << vnl.

Figure 1 shows the experimental data for the cross section for ionizing collisions of fully

stripped ions colliding with a hydrogen atom,

X q+ + H(1s)

X q+ + H + + e,

where X q+ denotes fully stripped ions of H, He, Li, C atoms, and (1s) symbolizes the ground

state of a hydrogen atom. The experimental data for H + ions were taken from [40] (note

that authors of this reference concluded that the previous measurements of the cross sections

were inaccurate); from [41] for He+2, C +6 ions ; and from [42] for Li+3 ions.

From Fig.1 it is evident that the Bethe formula describes well the cross sections for

projectile velocities larger than the orbital velocities v >> vnl. At large energies, the GGV

formula underestimates the cross sections as discussed before, whereas Gryzinski’s formula

gives results close to the Bethe formula and the experimental data. Both, the GGV and

Gryzinski formulas disagree with the experimental data at small energies.

B. Behavior of cross sections at small projectile velocities v < vnl

The Bethe, GGV and Gryzinski’s formulas fail at small velocities because they assume

free electrons, neglecting the inﬂuence of the target atom potential on the electron motion

during the collision. Apparently the assumption of free electron motion fails if the circulation

period of the electron around the atom’s nucleus is comparable with the interaction time

of an ion with the electron. Let us now estimate the projectile velocities at which the

electron circulation needs to be taken into account. The typical impact parameter leading

to ionization is

Here, Zp is the charge of the fully stripped projectile and ZT is the nuclear charge of the

target atom or ion. For velocities larger than vmax, the ionization cross section decreases as

the velocity increases [see Eq.(11)] due to the decreasing interaction time with an increase

in velocity. On the other hand, for velocities less than vmax, the collision becomes more

adiabatic. The inﬂuence of the projectile is averaged out due to the slower motion of

the projectile compared with the electron orbital velocity, and the ionization cross section

decreases with decreasing projectile velocity. Thus, the cross section has a maximum at

Note that if the projectile speed is comparable with or smaller than the electron orbital

sections, as for example in Ref.

[43]. Nevertheless for the case 2Zp ∼

of the cross section calculated from the Born approximation is similar to the experimental

results. To describe the behavior of the cross section near the maximum, the second-order

Equation (21) was derived making use of the unperturbed atomic electron wave functions,

which implicitly assumes that the projectile particle transfers momentum to the electron and

departs to large distances, where it does not aﬀect the electron to be ionized. The wave

function can therefore be described as a continuous spectrum of the atomic electron, not

aﬀected by the projectile.

This assumption breaks down at low projectile velocities when the projectile velocity is

comparable with the electron orbital velocity.

Indeed, the electron kinetic energy in the

frame of the projectile is of order mev2/2 and the potential energy Zpe2/ρioniz, where ρioniz

is the impact parameter leading to ionization, given by Eq.(18). Substituting ρioniz from
Eq.(18) into electron potential energy Zpe2/ρioniz gives that potential energy is larger than

kinetic energy if

v < vnl.

(22)

Therefore, under the condition in Eq.(22), an electron can be eﬀectively captured by the

projectile after the collision instead of leading to ionization. As a result, the ionization cross

section is small compared with the charge exchange cross section at low projectile velocities.

The assumption of the unperturbed electron wave function results in grossly overestimated

ionization cross sections as can be seen in Fig.1.

The ionization cross sections are also diﬃcult to measure at small projectile energies,

because careful separation between the large charge exchange cross section and the small

ionization cross section is necessary for the correct measurement [40]. Therefore, early

measurements of the ionization cross section at small velocities were not always accurate

and less well for He and H molecules with the same ions [22]. Because σBethe

mod (v) becomes
negative for v < 0.7, Gillespie’s Eq.(23) can not be applied to these low projectile velocities.

In principle, the general ﬁt σBA

f it in Eq.(21) can be used instead of σBethe
mod

in Eq.(20). However,

because the two formulas diﬀer considerably in the range of interest, 0.7 < v < 1, the ﬁtting

coeﬃcients λnl have to be updated for use with σBA
f it .

Although Gillespie’s ﬁt proved to be very useful, there are a number of reasons to look

for another ﬁt. Gryzinski’s Eq.(C6) is frequently used, because it requires only knowledge of

one function for calculations of cross sections, notwithstanding the fact that it overestimates

the cross sections at low energies.

2. Bohr and Linhard’s treatment

For v . vnl, a universal curve is expected if both the cross sections and the square of

impact velocity are divided by Zp [48]. This scaling was established for the total electron

loss cross section σel, which includes both the charge exchange cross section σce and the

ionization cross section. Based on the results of classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC)

calculations, Olson proposed the following ﬁt [49],

σel(v, Zp) = ZpAnlπa2

logarithmic term in the Bethe formula [Eq.(11)] for v >> v0

Zp because it is based on

classical trajectory calculations. To make Eq. (24) agree with Eq.(6), the coeﬃcients γnl

should be proportional to √Inl. For example, the ionization potential for hydrogen is IH =

13.6eV , and for helium IHe = 24.6eV . The ratio of γH = 1.12 to γHe = 1.44 diﬀers

from √IH/√IHe by only ﬁve percent, i.e., γH/√IH/

γHe/√IHe

= 1.05. Therefore, as was

shown by Janev [50], the scaling in Eq.(24) can be rewritten in a form similar to Eq.(10) by

Because the scaling in Eq.(24) is based on classical trajectory calculations, it is valid

p

only for intermediate velocities where the underbarrier transitions allowed in the quantum

A similar scaling to Eq.(24) was derived in Ref.[64] based on quantum mechanical cal-

×

culations making use of the quasi-classical approach developed originally by Keldysh for

multi-photon ionization of atoms in a strong electromagnetic ﬁeld. These calculations give

scaling similar to Eq.(24), but with a diﬀerent function f (x) given in [64]. The quantum

mechanical calculation results for the charge exchange cross section in Ref. [64] are a factor

of 3 larger than Olson’s cross section in Eq.(24) for v/(v0

Zp) < 0.2.

Direct application of the scaling in Eq.(25) for the ionization cross section instead of

p

the total electron removal cross section does not produce a single scaled function [see Fig.2

for hydrogen and Fig. 4.(b) for helium]. Furthermore, the data are considerably scattered

near the maxima of the cross sections. A number of other semi-empirical models have been

developed, which use up to ten ﬁtting parameters to describe the ionization cross sections

over the entire projectile energy range [19].

III. NEW FIT FORMULA FOR THE IONIZATION CROSS SECTION

Analysis of the experimental data in Fig.1 shows that the maxima of the experimentally

measured cross sections occur at

Zp + 1, not at

Zp as would be the case according to

Olson’s scaling in Eq.(24). Therefore, it is natural to plot cross sections as a function of

p

Zp + 1). Note that at large velocities, according to Eq.(6)

Resulting plots of the scaled cross sections are shown in Fig.3. Comparing Fig.2 and Fig.3

one can clearly see that all of the experimental data merge close to each other on the scaled

plot based on Eq.(26).

The resulting universal function can be ﬁtted with various functions, but the simplest ﬁt

was proposed by Rost and Pattard [52]. They showed that if both the cross section and the

projectile velocity are normalized to the values of cross section and projectile velocity at the

cross section maximum, then the scaled cross section σ/σmax is well described by the ﬁtting

estimate Bnl = 0.8 for the ionization of hydrogen by protons, while for ionization of hydrogen

by bare nuclei of helium and lithium, we ﬁnd Bnl = 0.93. As can be seen from Fig.3, the

function in Eq.(27) with σmax and vmax deﬁned in Eq.(28) describes well the cross sections

at small and intermediate energies, but underestimates the cross section at high energies.

The reason is that the function in Eq.(27) does not reproduce the logarithmic term in the

Bethe formula in Eq.(11). To improve the agreement with the experimental data and the

Bethe formula we propose a new scaling for the ﬁtting function in Eq.(26) deﬁned by

(cid:1)(cid:3)

At large x >> 1, Eq.(30) approaches the Bethe formula in Eq.(15), and at small x < 1,

Eq.(30) approaches the result in Eq.(27). The function Gnew(x) has a maximum at x

with Gnew(1)

0.86. Because 0.86 is in between the maxima of the scaled cross section of

≃

hydrogen by protons (Bnl = 0.8) and the cross section for ionization of hydrogen by bare

nuclei of helium and lithium (Bnl = 0.93), we did not incorporate the coeﬃcients Bnl in

(30)

1,

≃

17

Eq.(30). This gives it a general form and introduces small errors of less than 8%.

We have applied the new ﬁt in Eqs.(26) and (30) to the ionization cross section of helium,

shown in Fig.4a. The symbols in Fig.4a denote the experimental data for H +, He+2, Li+3

[53, 54], for C +6 [55], for I +Zp and U +Zp [56], and for Au+Zp [57], where Zp = 10

40. The

−

solid curves correspond to the continuum-distorted-wave-eikonal initial state (CDW-EIS)

theoretical calculation from Ref. [58], which is a generalization of the Born approximation.

The CDW-EIS theory accounts for the distortion of the electron wave function by the pro-

jectile. From Fig.4a it is evident that the CDW-EIS theory overestimates the cross section

near the maximum, and underestimates the cross section at small energies.

Direct application of the scaling formula in Eq.(25) to the ionization of helium does not

produce similar good results to the hydrogen case [see Fig. 4(b)]. But after applying the

new scaling in Eq.(26), all of the experimental and theoretical results merge close together

on the scaled plot, as is clearly evident in Fig.4(c). Moreover, if we use the ﬁt function

of velocity normalized to the orbital velocity vnl estimated from the ionization potential of

helium (IHe = 24.6eV) making use of Eq.(9), the cross section is given by the same scaling as

in Eq.(26) with the same function as in Eq.(30), as evident from Fig.4(d). (The number of

electrons in the helium atom is Nnl = 2, and therefore the scaled cross section is twice that of

hydrogen.) From Fig.4(d) it is clear that the new proposed ﬁt in Eq.(26) using the function

in Eq.(30) gives very good results for both hydrogen and helium. Further veriﬁcation of the

new scaling is diﬃcult because reliable experimental data and numerical simulations for a

broad range of projectile velocities are absent for other atoms. The discrepancy between the

new ﬁt and the helium data at very small velocities is discussed in the next section.

Note that one experimental point in Fig.4 for C +6 projectiles is located far away from

the ﬁt. The error bar for this point is about 30% [55]. This data may be inaccurate, as the

experimental point is higher than the predictions of CDW-EIS theory, which overestimates

the cross section near the maxima of the cross sections for all other ions. The reason for the

large scatter in the uranium data on the scaled plot at small energies is not clear, because

the experimental data for all other projectiles are located much closer to the ﬁt line.

IV. THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THE NEW FIT FORMULA FOR

IONIZATION CROSS SECTION

In this section we discuss the theoretical foundations for the new ﬁt to the ionization

cross section given by Eq.(26) and Eq.(30). We start with an analysis of high projectile

velocities.

p
[The factor

(Zp + 1)/2 appears in the

denominator under the logarithm in the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of Eq.(31).] We

p

claim that incorporating this factor gives a better cross section estimate than the Bethe

formula. A comparison of the existing experimental data with the Bethe formula in Eq.(11)

and the ﬁt formula in Eq.(31) is shown in Fig.5. The experimentally estimated uncertainty

of 5.5% [42] is shown by the error bar. The region of validity of the Born approximation

and, hence, the Bethe formula is [27, 28]

v > max(2Zpv0, vnl).

(32)

The ﬁrst condition in Eq.(32) assures that the projectile potential is taken into account

in the Born approximation; the second condition allows use of the unperturbed atomic

wave function. Unfortunately the experimental data exists in the region in Eq.(32) only for

the ionization of hydrogen by protons. Figure 5 shows that the Bethe formula describes

the experimental data for ionization of hydrogen by protons within the error bar only for

v > 6v0. Application of the ﬁt formula instead of the Bethe formula reduces discrepancy

with the data.

The applicability of the Born theory and the Bethe formula in Eq.(11) was studied

experimentally in Refs. [32, 55, 57, 59]. It was conﬁrmed that the necessary condition for

the validity of the Bethe formula is given by the condition in Eq.(32). The failure of the

Bethe formula for large Zp is apparent from the experimental data for gold ions shown in

Fig.4(a). The ion velocity corresponds to v = 12v0 or v = 8.9vnl, whereas Zp = 24, 43, 54,

and does not satisfy the condition in Eq.(32). As a result, the cross sections are much smaller

than given by the Bethe formula, as evident from Fig.4(a). (At large projectile energies, all

data merge to the Bethe formula, which corresponds to a straight line in a logarithmic plot,

similar to Fig.1.)

The applicability of the Bethe formula is limited by the validity of the Born approxi-

mation. One of the easiest ways to correct it was suggested in Ref.[64]. Firstly, the Born

This calculation results in a smaller cross section than the Bethe formula for 2Zpv0/v > 1.

Note that in the above analysis we have used unperturbed electron wave functions, which is

valid only for v >> v0.

23

While a number of smart semi-empirical ways to improve the ﬁrst Born approximation

were developed [60, 61, 62], the rigorous approaches to improve the Bethe formula are

based on the eikonal approximation instead of the Born approximation [63]. The eikonal

approximation is justiﬁed if kanl > 1, where k is the projectile particle wave vector k =
Mv/~, and the projectile kinetic energy is large compared to the potential energy interaction

with the target. For heavy projectile particles with mass much larger than the electron mass,

these conditions are well satisﬁed. The ionization cross section in the eikonal approximation

is given by [27]

(cid:19)

The eikonal approximation in Eqs.(43) and (44) accounts approximately for all orders of

the perturbation series, whereas the Born approximation only make use of the ﬁrst order.

The calculations in the eikonal approximation yield a formula similar to Eq.(42) [65]. Note

that the validity of the eikonal approximation in Eq.(44) is limited to v >> v0,because the

electron wave functions Ψi and Ψf are assumed to be unperturbed atomic functions. The

inﬂuence of the projectile on the electron wave functions has to be taken into account for

v . v0. This is typically performed in the distorted wave approximation [16].

Therefore, the correction to the Born approximation in Eq.(42) and the eikonal approxi-

mation give a formula similar to Eq.(31) but with a factor α

Zp (α is a coeﬃcient of order

unity), instead of

(Zp + 1)/2. At large velocities, both formulas give similar results.

B. Behavior of cross sections at small projectile velocities v < vnl

If the projectile velocity is small compared with the orbital velocity, the collision is

adiabatic and the electron circulates many times around both nuclei. The electronic energy

states need to be determined in such a quasimolecule as a function of the positions of both

nuclei at a particular time. In both the quantum mechanical and the classical approaches,

ionization is only possible if during the collision the initial and ﬁnal electronic terms cross at

some instant. In classical mechanics this corresponds to the so-called ”v/2 mechanism”. In

a collisional system comprised of two nuclei of equal charges (say ionization of hydrogen by

24

a proton), an electron which is exactly in between the two nuclei experiences a very small

electric ﬁeld because the electric ﬁelds from both nuclei exactly cancel for all times at this

point. The electron can ”ride” this saddle point of the potential if its velocity is equal to

one-half the velocity of the projectile. The collision dynamics is illustrated in Fig.6.

with velocity 1/2. Atomic units are used: velocity is normalized to v0; distance is normalized to

a0; and time is normalized to a0/v0. Figure 6(b) shows the position [x(t), z(t)] of the electron as a

function of time, and the distance between the electron and the ﬁrst (ρ1) and the second proton

(ρ2) for the same conditions as in Fig.6(a). The trajectory of a S-promotion is shown in Figs.6(c)

for ﬁxed positive charges (v

0). The initial conditions correspond to an internuclear separation

vz = 1.155 (solid line), and vz = 1.165 (dotted line).

From Fig.6 one can see that the electron is stranded in between the protons at t = 15a0/v0

and its velocity projection on the x-axis is one-half of the projectile velocity. A small

variation of the initial condition from z =

1.606756a0 (solid line) to z =

1.606751a0

−
(dotted line) completely changes the result of the collision. After the collision the electron

−

stays near the ﬁrst nucleus and does not become ionized. As a result, the probability

of ionization is extremely small even though the projectile velocity is not small (for the

conditions in Fig.6, v = 1/2 in atomic units). The mechanism for ionization described

above is also so-called T-promotion in quantum mechanical descriptions [67].

Another mechanism for ionization is attributed to the so-called S-promotion mechanism

[67]. It is associated with the special type of trajectory of the electron in the ﬁeld of two

positive charges, shown in Fig.6(c). Figure 6(c) shows that an electron with particular initial

conditions tends to spiral with a large number of turns enclosing a segment of the straight

line joining the nuclei Fig.6(c) [68]. Such a trajectory is unstable - a small variation of initial

conditions results in a completely diﬀerent trajectory as shown in Fig.6(c). Analysis of the

electron motion in the ﬁeld of two positive charges, ZT and ZP , which are separated by a

R, respectively. Moreover, rp is the radius vector from the projectile to the electron; rT is

−
the radius vector from the target nucleus to the electron; and R is the radius vector from the

projectile to the target nucleus. The canonical momentum Pξ in Eq.(47) tends to inﬁnity if

1, preventing the electron from approaching a segment of the straight line joining the

ξ

→

nuclei, ξ = 1. In the special case

(ZP + ZT )R = λ, Pφ = 0,

(50)

the singularity vanishes at the point ξ = 1 in Eq.(47). As a result, for initial conditions

satisfying the condition in Eq.(50), Pξ is ﬁnite for ξ = 1. From Eq.(46), ξ approach unity

exponentially with time – the limiting electron trajectory lies on the internuclear axis – as

shown in Fig.6(c), where the initial conditions for the solid line correspond to the condition

in Eq.(50). A small departure from the condition in Eq.(50) shown by the dotted line in

Fig.6(c) prevents the trajectory from approaching ξ = 1. Thus the internuclear axis ξ = 1,

represents the locus of points of unstable equilibria. In a quantum mechanical treatment,

such periodic unstable trajectories is responsible for S-promotion of electron to the the

continuum (ionization) when the nuclei approach each other [69]. The potential barrier in

Eq.(47) increases when R decreases. As a result, an electron near the top of the barrier slows

down and is then collected and promoted to the continuum as the top of the barrier further

rises. Due to the strong instability of the locus, a numerical simulation of the corresponding

classical trajectory is extremely diﬃcult. [We could not present the classical analog of the

ionization scenario for S-promotion, in contrast to the T-promotion as shown in Fig. 6(a)

The probability of ionization is greatly enhanced in quantum mechanics due to tunnelling

into classically forbidden regions of phase space. The cross sections can be calculated using

the quasiclassical method, where the probability of transition is given by

and (b).]

Moreover, n numerates diﬀerent branch points or channels of ionization for S and T-

−

by only two exponents with R1 = 1.9 , ∆1 = 0.53 (corresponding to S-promotion) and

R2 = 6.7, ∆2 = 1.8 (corresponding to T-promotion). Because ∆1 << ∆2, primarily the

S-promotion determines the ionization cross section at small velocities (v < 0.5), while both

mechanisms contribute to ionization for v in the range v = 0.5

1. Recent experimental

−

study and quantum mechanical calculations using the continuum-distorted-wave eikonal-

initial-state (CDW-EIS) model [70] show that a electron emission spectrum is dominated

by a well deﬁned electron capture to continuum (S-promotion) peak although existence of

saddle-point electron emission (T-promotion) is not conﬁrmed.

Eq.(30) underestimates the cross section for v < 0.5, but gives a result close to the sum in

Eq.(53) for v in the range v = 0.5

1. While the data for hydrogen at very low projectile

−

velocity is absent, and the ﬁt agrees well for the entire dataset in Fig.3, the disagreement

is clearly seen when the ﬁt is compared with the experimental data for the ionization of He

shown in Fig.4(d). Adiabatic theory results are absent for helium, but the experimental ion-

ization cross section of He by protons can be described by Eq.(53) with diﬀerent coeﬃcients

∆n and Rn. The behavior of the experimental ionization cross section of He by He+2 is

somewhat puzzling because of the very slow decrease of the cross section for small projectile

velocity.

In view of

these observations,

the applicability of

the new ﬁt

is

limited to

28

v/[vnl

(Zp + 1)] > 0.5. Note that for small projectile velocity the ionization cross sec-

tion is ten times smaller than the maximum of the cross section, σmax, and the ionization

p

cross section is completely dominated by charge exchange, whose cross section is compara-

ble to σmax. Consequently both experimental measurements and theoretical simulations are

very diﬃcult for very small projectile velocity.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The new scaling in Eq.(26) for the ionization and stripping cross sections of atoms and ions

by fully stripped projectiles has been proposed. The new scaling does not have any ﬁtting

parameters and describes the shape of the cross section as a single function of the scaled

projectile velocity [Eq.(30)]. Note that previous scaling laws either used ﬁtting parameters

([46, 52]) or actually did not match experiments in a wide range of projectile velocities

[20, 34]. The proposed scaling formula agrees well with theoretical predictions in the limit

of large projectile velocities. The new scaling has been veriﬁed by comparison with available

experimental data and theoretical simulations for the ionization cross sections of hydrogen

and helium by H +, He+2, Li+3, C +6, and O+8. The agreement between the new proposed

scaling and experimental data is very good. The diﬀerence between the proposed ﬁt and

the experimental data is within 15% accuracy, which is similar to the estimated uncertainty

in the measurements. The validity of the ﬁt is limited at very small velocities, where the

ionization cross section is very small, about one-tenth of the maximum cross section σmax,

and the ionization cross section is completely dominated by charge exchange, whose cross

section is comparable to σmax. Finally, the ﬁt is valid for scaled projectile velocity v >

0.5vnl

Zp + 1, where vnl = v0

2Inl/E0 is the orbital velocity of the electron estimated from

the ionization potential Inl, where E0 = 27.2eV (twice the hydrogen ionization potential).

Similarly, the ﬁt is valid for E > 12.5(Zp + 1)Inl/E0 in units of keV /amu, where E is the

projectile kinetic energy per nucleon.

APPENDIX A: CLASSICAL CROSS SECTION AVERAGED OVER ATOMIC

ELECTRON VELOCITY DIRECTIONS

Gerjuoy averaged the Rutherford cross section over all orientations of the electron velocity

ve (for a ﬁxed electron speed ve) and derived the diﬀerential cross section dσ/d∆E(ve, v, ∆E)

for energy transfer ∆E in the collision between a free electron and the projectile [34]. The

total cross section is calculated by integrating over values of energy transfer larger than

the ionization potential (∆E > Inl ) and averaging over the electron velocity distribution

function (EVDF) f (ve). This gives

APPENDIX B: THE BORN APPROXIMATION

Although the Born approximation is valid only for large projectile velocities v >> Zpv0

[27], the Born approximation does give results close to the experimental data even outside

its validity range [47]. Therefore, we have studied cross sections in the Born approximation

for the entire velocity range.

In the Born approximation, the ionization cross section for hydrogen atoms by impact of

fully stripped projectile atoms with charge Zp is given by [16, 38, 39],

where PInl(q,

v) is the probability of ionization, and qmev0 is the momentum transfer dur-

ing the collision. We introducing the velocity in atomic units

Having estimated the function PInl(q,

lytically for large v >> v0. The region of small q contributes signiﬁcantly to the cross

section [see Eq.(B1)]. Therefore, we split the integration in Eq.(B1) into the two re-

gions q < qup and q > qup, where qup = 1/2. In the ﬁrst region q < qup, it follows that

In classical mechanics, ionization occurs if the energy transfer to the electron is more than

A small momentum transfer to the electron along the projectile trajectory qz(ρ) can be

determined making use of the energy conservation. Due to conservation of the momentum,

the momentum transferred from the projectile particle is

Let us compare Eq.(B23) with the quantum mechanical result Eq.(B5). In the limit q >> 1,

q and the two functions are equivalent. Both functions dP (q, κ)/dκ have a maximum

≈

at κ = q, and the width of the maximum is of order 1, which simply means that the entire

momentum q is transferred to the ionized electron momentum κ.

Moreover it is possible to prove that the classical mechanical dPc(q, κ)/dκ is equivalent

to the quantum mechanical function dPq(q, κ)/dκ for any s

electron orbital (spherically

Equation (B33) is identical to Eq.(B1), where the quantum mechanical ionization proba-

bility Pq(q, v) is replaced by the classical mechanical ionization probability Pc(q) in Eq.(B30).

The functions Pq(q, v) [Eq.(B2)] and Pc(q) [Eq.(B30)] are shown in Fig.8. Figure 8 shows

that the functions PInl(q, v) and Pc(q) are nearly identical for q > 0.6. The classical proba-

bility of ionization Pc(q) rapidly tends to zero for q < 0.6, while the quantum probability of

APPENDIX C: FORMULARY FOR IONIZATION CROSS SECTION

In the high energy limit of fast projectile motion v >> vnl, the classical mechanical

calculation can be readily carried out (see Appendix A).

Rost and Pattard [52] proposed a ﬁt for the ionization cross section, which utilizes two

ﬁtting parameters, namely the maximum value of the cross section and projectile energy

corresponding to the maximum value of the cross section. They showed that if both the

cross section and the projectile velocity are normalized to the values of the cross section and

the projectile velocity at the cross section maximum, then the scaled cross section σ/σmax

is well described by the ﬁtting function [52]

where σmax is the maximum cross section, which occurs at the velocity vmax.

We have shown that for ionization by a bare projectile, the values σmax and vmax are well

deﬁned by the projectile charge Zp, with

or lithium, Bnl = 0.93.

Equation (C14) describes well the cross sections at small and intermediate energies, but

underestimates the cross section at high energies, because it does not reproduce the logarith-

mic term of the Bethe formula in Eq.(C7). To improve the agreement with the experimental

data and the Bethe formula, we propose the new scaling

In all previous equations cross section are given per electron in the orbital. If Nnl is the

number of electrons in the orbital, the ionization cross section of any electron in the orbital

should be increased by the factor Nnl.

Finally, it should be noted that a number of other semi-empirical models have been

developed, which use up to ten ﬁtting parameters to describe the ionization cross sections

over the entire projectile energy range [19].

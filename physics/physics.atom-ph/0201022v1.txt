We study long range interactions between two Rydberg atoms and predict the existence of ultra-
long range Rydberg dimers with equilibrium distances of many thousand Bohr radii. We calculate
the dispersion coeﬃcients C5, C6 and C8 for two rubidium atoms in the same excited level np, and
ﬁnd that they scale like n8, n11 and n15, respectively. We show that for certain molecular symme-
tries, these coeﬃcients lead to long range potential wells that can support molecular bound levels.
Such macrodimers would be very sensitive to their environment, and could probe weak interactions.
We suggest experiments to detect these macrodimers.

PACS numbers: 34.20.Cf, 32.80.Rm, 32.80.Pj

New techniques used for cooling and trapping of atoms
[1] and molecules [2], and which led to the realization of
atomic Bose–Einstein condensation [3], have also been
applied to experiments with ultracold plasmas [4], and
ultracold Rydberg atoms [5]. The exaggerated proper-
ties of Rydberg atoms provide a fertile ground for new
physics. For example, transport properties of ultracold
gases doped with ions were recently explored and ex-
tended to cold Rydberg samples [6], while entangled
states relevant for quantum computing can also be pro-
duced with ultracold Rydberg atoms [7]. Finally, the
creation of “trilobite” Rydberg molecules was proposed
[8], where one atom of the dimer remains in its ground
state while the second one is excited to a Rydberg state.
In this paper, we explore the interactions between two
Rydberg atoms. We show that long range wells support-
ing several bound levels exist for certain molecular sym-
metries. We explore the sensitivity of these wells to the
particular asymptotic form of the potential long range ex-
pansion and show that their existence is robust. We also
estimate the eﬀect of retardation as well as the validity
of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. We give nu-
merical examples for the case of rubidium (Rb), and dis-
cuss experimental schemes to detect these macrodimers.
These molecules could lead to measurements of very weak
interactions, such as vacuum ﬂuctuations, and provide a
unique tool to study quenching in ultracold collisions.

We consider two atoms each excited by one photon
from their ground state into the same Rydberg state np
[9], where n is the principal quantum number. For Rb,
this corresponds to the 5s → np transition [10]. At large
separation R, the potential energy between two atoms
can be expanded in powers of 1/R [11]. For two identical
atoms in the same np state, it takes the form [12]

decaying exchange interactions, which can be neglected
at large enough R.

The numerical values of C5, C6 and C8 [13] were cal-
culated using the expressions of Marinescu [12]. The
sums over the electronic states were evaluated directly,
and using the n-scaling of the dipole (∝ n2), quadrupole
(∝ n4), and octopole (∝ n6) matrix elements and the
energy diﬀerences (∝ n−3) involved, we obtained the fol-
lowing scaling laws: C5 ∝ n8, C6 ∝ n11, and C8 ∝ n15.
The magnitude and sign of the dispersion coeﬃcients de-
pend on the molecular symmetry considered, and it is
possible to obtain a long range potential well with an
attractive long range R−5 contribution and a repulsive
shorter range R−6 or R−8 contribution (see Fig. 1). For
the np − np asymptote, we found that three pairs of de-
generate molecular states give long range potential wells:
1Πg-3Πu, 3Σ−
u , and one of 1Σ+

For the system to be adequately described by Eq. (1),
the exchange energy must be negligible. To estimate
the region of validity of Eq. (1), we use the Le Roy

tant and Eq. (1) is not adequate to describe the system.
In Fig. 1, we illustrate the wells for the three pairs

of Rb with n = 20. The Le Roy radius RLR is equal to
1902 a0, where a0 is a Bohr radius. The well of the pair of
states 1Σ+
u is very deep (potential depth De = 4.5 ×
106 cm−1), but is located at a much shorter distance than
the Le Roy radius (equilibrium distance Re = 240 a0):
the interactions for these states are not well described by
Eq. (1), as opposed to the two other pairs. The well of the
pair 1Πg-3Πu has a depth De = 3.74 × 10−2 cm−1 and an
equilibrium distance Re = 2509 a0. By comparison, the
well of the pair 3Σ−
u is much shallower and farther
away, with De = 6.88 × 10−5 cm−1 and Re = 4956 a0.
In Fig. 2, we compare De, Re and RLR for the three
pairs for various values of n, and ﬁnd the same general
behavior. For the remainder of this letter, we focus our
attention on the deeper wells described by Eq. (1), i.e.,
the 1Πg-3Πu pair, since the much shallower wells of the
g -1Σ−
3Σ−
u pair may prove more diﬃcult to detect.
In Fig. 3, we illustrate the scaling of the dispersion
coeﬃcients, equilibrium distance, and well depth of the
1Πg-3Πu pair as a function of n.
In atomic units, the
coeﬃcients are given approximately by C5 ∼ 3 n8,
C6 ∼ −0.7 n11, and C8 ∼ −50 n15 (see Fig. 3(a)). Ne-

to zero, we ﬁnd that the equilibrium distance scales as
Re ∼ 0.3 n3 a0, in good agreement with the numerical
values shown in Fig. 3(b). The scaling of De is 108n−7
cm−1, as expected (see Fig. 3(c)). Note that other pairs
may have diﬀerent Re and De scaling, depending on the
relative magnitude of the dispersion terms. The wells for
the 1Πg-3Πu pair, although shallow, support many vibra-
tional bound levels. In Table I, we list the two lowest and
highest levels found for n = 20, 40 and 70 [16], which sup-
port 143, 125 and 107 bound levels, respectively. While
the wells for high n are much shallower than those with
smaller n (e.g., see n = 20 and 70 in Table I), their larger
extension leads to denser energy levels, and hence they
also support a large number of levels.

When using the expression for V (R),

the Born–
Oppenheimer approximation is assumed valid. To ver-
ify that it is the case, we compare the vibrational period
τvib(v) of a given bound level v with the typical time for
the electron motion τe = h/|En| = (4π/αc)n2a0 where
En is the electron binding energy. If τe/τvib ≪ 1, the Ry-
dberg electrons of both atoms easily follow the motion of
the ions, and the Born–Oppenheimer curve V (R) needs
no further diabatic corrections. Taking the levels in Ta-
ble I as examples, for n = 20, we ﬁnd τe/τvib ∼ 1.5×10−6
for the lowest level v = 0, and 2.2 × 10−11 for the highest
level v = 142: the electrons follow adiabatically the ions
for all vibrational levels. For n = 70, the ratio becomes
6.8 × 10−9 for v = 0 and 4.5 × 10−14 for v = 106. Natu-
rally, the Born–Oppenheimer approximation gets better
for the higher vibrational levels, since they are more ex-
tended and therefore take more time to make a full os-
cillation. However, the spontaneous decay of one of the
excited Rydberg atoms will limit the lifetime of these long
range molecules and prevent the existence of the upper
lying vibrational bound levels. Although the lifetime of
the excited atoms is long, scaling as τat ∼ τ0n3, where
τ0 ∼ 1.4 ns [17], it is much shorter than the vibrational
period for high v. E.g., for n = 20, we ﬁnd τat ∼ 11.2
µs and τvib = 0.083 µs and 5.58 ms for v = 0 and 142,

In ef-
fect, the upper vibrational levels can be considered as
quasi-continuum states since only a fraction of an entire
oscillation will take place before de-excitation.

Another eﬀect limiting the existence of Rydberg long
range molecules is auto-ionization. When two excited
atoms interact, one atom can decay to a lower excited
state while the second atom is ionized, the free elec-
tron picking up most of the kinetic energy. However,
if the separation between the Rydberg atoms is larger
than RLR, there is little overlap between their electronic
clouds, and one expects the auto-ionization probability
to be small (the atoms interact via their electric dipoles
at such distances). Note also that for alkali dimers in
general [18], and Rb in particular, avoided crossings with
the ionic curves (here correlated to Rb++Rb−) perturb
the lowest asymptotes such as 5p − 5p. However, for the
case where the Le Roy radius condition is satisﬁed, i.e.,
for n ≥ 20 (see Fig. 2(b)), the np − np asymptotes are
much higher than the ionic curves, and no perturbation
from avoided crossings will occur.

The density of electronic states in the Rydberg region
is very large, and avoided crossings from potential curves
correlated to other asymptotes with the same symmetry
could perturb the shallow wells. However, the closest
asymptotes are generally separated by several times the
potential depth De, and no avoided crossing in the well

region occur [19]. Fig. 4 illustrates the well for 40p − 40p
and the two nearest curves correlated to 36s − 47p and
42s − 36f , for the 1Πg-3Πu symmetries. The separa-
tion between them is much larger than De and no cross-
ings occur. Although the various asymptotes become
denser as n increases, the potentials become very shal-
low (De ∝ n−7), and generally no crossing is found. Note
that avoided crossings from a lower asymptote repulsive
curve and a higher asymptote attractive curve (with the
same symmetry) could, in fact, produce deep wells.

For these extremely extended states, retardation ef-
fects may become important. Again, to estimate the
importance of the photon time-of-ﬂight, we compare the
electronic time τe with the time it takes a photon to cover
the distance between the two centers: τph ∼ R/c. For the
highest levels, the relevant distance is the outer turning
point R2, but for the deeper levels, a good estimate is ob-
tained by using the equilibrium distance Re. Using the
scaling Re ∼ 0.3 n3, we have τph/τe ∼ (0.3α/4π)n ≪ 1
for n < 100. For the highest vibrational levels v in Ta-
ble I, we get τph/τe ∼ 0.06, 0.07, and 0.11, for R2 of
v = 140, 141, and 142, respectively (for n = 20), and
τph/τe ∼ 0.19, 0.26, and 0.51 for R2 of v = 104, 105, and
106, respectively (for n = 70). Although retardation ef-
fects are not important for the lower vibrational levels
(with R2 slightly larger than Re), even for large n, one
needs to consider them for the higher vibrational levels.
The sensitivity of the interaction potential to retardation
eﬀects could actually be used to detect these eﬀects with
high accuracy using high precision spectroscopy.

We included three terms in the asymptotic 1/R expan-
sion (1), but one has to verify the eﬀect of the truncation
on the well properties. The standard procedure to esti-
mate the maximum error due to the truncation of higher
terms is to include half of the last term [20]: here, C8. In
Fig. 4, we illustrate the eﬀect of such variation for n = 40.
The well becomes deeper, but is still located outside the
Le Roy radius, hence the existence of long range wells is
robust to the truncation of the 1/R expansion.

To detect these Rydberg macrodimers, one could pho-
toassociate them from the ground state (5s for Rb) to
the target molecular symmetry, using appropriate pho-
ton wavelength and polarization. After the photoassoci-
ation pulse [10], one can ﬁeld-ionize the system with an
electric pulse and detect the ions. The existence of the
molecules should lead to small peaks red-detuned from
the atomic asymptote. Because the spacing of the bound
levels is small, individual levels will be hard to detect (a
laser width smaller than the spacing ∆ is needed:
for
n = 20, ∆ ∼ 10−3 cm−1 ∼ 300 MHz for the deepest
levels), and the most probable signature would be an
overall red-detuned peak. The wells are shallow, and
only those deep enough could be detected. To enhance
the sensitivity of the detection scheme, one could also
use radio-frequency to excite a bound level to a contin-
uum state corresponding to another asymptote (e.g., to
(n + 1)s − np). The detection of any (n + 1)s atoms (e.g.,
by ramp-ﬁeld ionization) would be attributed to the ex-
istence of a long range bound molecular state, since the
RF ﬁeld would not be resonant with free np atoms.

We have computed long range interactions between two
Rb atoms in the same np state, and found that shallow
long range wells supporting several vibrational levels ex-
ist for certain molecular symmetries. Although speciﬁc
calculations were performed for Rb and np − np asymp-
totes, the existence of these macrodimers is general: one
can expect them for various asymptotes n1ℓ1 − n2ℓ2 and
for all alkali atoms. Furthermore, avoided crossing be-
tween curves of the same symmetry with diﬀerent asymp-
totes could also provide deep long range molecular wells,
in a manner similar to the long range wells observed in
many alkali dimers [21]. The macrodimers are extremely
sensitive to their environment, and as such, they could be
used as probes for extremely weak interactions, e.g., to
measure retardation eﬀects and vacuum ﬂuctuations, or
any weak electromagnetic interaction. Also, due to their
very small rovibrational energy splittings, macrodimers
would provide a unique tool to study quenching in ul-
tracold collisions, since they would remain trapped (as
opposed to usual dimers [22]). Finally, the detection of
such exotic molecules in itself would be a considerable
achievement.

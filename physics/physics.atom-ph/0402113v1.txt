In the laser excitation of ultracold atoms to Rydberg states, we observe a dramatic suppression
caused by van der Waals interactions. This behavior is interpreted as a local excitation blockade:
Rydberg atoms strongly inhibit excitation of their neighbors. We measure suppression, relative to
isolated atom excitation, by up to a factor of 6.4. The dependence of this suppression on both laser
irradiance and atomic density are in good agreement with a mean-ﬁeld model. These results are an
important step towards using ultracold Rydberg atoms in quantum information processing.

The possibility of a computer that operates accord-
ing to the principles of quantum mechanics has at-
tracted growing interest from a variety of research ﬁelds
[1, 2]. A number of possible implementations are be-
ing investigated, including solid-state systems, nuclear
magnetic resonance, cavity quantum electrodynamics,
trapped dipolar molecules, trapped ions, and trapped
neutral atoms. A key element to any successful system is
the ability to control the coherent interactions between
the fundamental building blocks (qubits). Highly-excited
Rydberg atoms with principal quantum numbers n & 30
have the advantage that they interact quite strongly with
each other, allowing information to be exchanged quickly
[3]. Here we report an important advance towards using
ultracold Rydberg atoms in quantum computing. We ob-
serve that the laser excitation of a macroscopic sample
of ultracold atoms to high-lying Rydberg states can be
dramatically suppressed by their strong long-range inter-
actions. This leads to a local blockade eﬀect, where the
excitation of one atom prevents excitation of its neigh-
bors. Our observations agree well with a model based on
mean-ﬁeld interactions.

In a high-n Rydberg state, the electron spends most of
its time quite far from the nucleus [4]. As a result, the
energy of this highly-excited state is very sensitive to ex-
ternal perturbations, including those caused by neighbor-
ing Rydberg atoms. A system of two ultracold Rydberg
atoms, subject to these long-range interactions, has been
proposed as a possible realization of a quantum logic gate
[3, 5]. Rydberg states combine the advantages of long
radiative lifetimes and strong long-range interactions, al-
lowing information to be exchanged before decoherence
sets in, even when the atoms are suﬃciently separated to
allow individual addressing. If the atoms are ultracold,
they can be highly localized, e.g., in the sites of an optical
lattice, allowing control of their interactions and eﬃcient
detection of their quantum state. An outstanding chal-
lenge is the assurance that at most a single Rydberg atom
is produced at a given site. Towards this end, the concept
of an excitation blockade has been proposed [6, 7]. With
multiple atoms occupying a suﬃciently localized site, the
strong Rydberg-Rydberg interactions allow at most one

Rydberg excitation. Further excitations are blocked by
the large energy level shifts that push the resonant fre-
quencies outside the laser bandwidth.

For two atoms in np states, separated by a distance R,
the C6/R6 van der Waals (vdW) interaction dominates
at long range [8, 9]. The rapid n11 scaling of the C6 co-
eﬃcient indicates the advantage of using high-n Rydberg
states. The original proposals for quantum gates[3] and
an excitation blockade [6] with Rydberg atoms involved
ﬁnite electric ﬁelds which mixed the angular momentum
states, giving rise to a C3/R3 dipole-dipole interaction.
The vdW interaction, which we have employed, has the
important advantage of providing nonzero energy level
shifts for every molecular state regardless of the orienta-
tion of the atoms. By contrast, dipole interactions van-
ish for certain orientations, reducing the eﬃciency of the
dipole blockade mechanism.

The basic idea of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1.
We start with a sample of about 107 ultracold 85Rb atoms
in the 5s ground state and illuminate them with a UV
pulse resonant with a transition to an np Rydberg state
[10]. Once a Rydberg atom is produced, the strong vdW
interaction shifts the energy levels of neighboring atoms,
suppressing their excitation. As a result, each Rydberg
atom resides in a domain, within which no other Rydberg
excitation is possible. The higher the atomic density, the
more atoms will be in each domain, and the larger will be
the factor by which the overall excitation fraction of the
macroscopic sample is suppressed. It is this suppression
that we observe in the experiment.

The ultracold sample of 85Rb atoms, with a peak den-
sity up to 1011 cm−3 and a temperature of ∼100 µK,
is provided by a diode-laser-based vapor-cell magneto-
optical trap (MOT). Trapped atoms in a speciﬁc hyper-
ﬁne level of the ground state are excited to np3/2 states
with n=30-80 by a narrowband 297 nm laser pulse of 8.6
ns duration (FWHM), generated by frequency doubling
of a pulse-ampliﬁed cw laser as in our earlier work [10].
The bandwidth of about 100 MHz, measured by scanning
over the 30p resonance, is about twice the Fourier trans-
form limit due to frequency chirping in the pulsed am-
pliﬁer [11]. In order to excite the highest density region,

Irradiance, scaled to n=30 (MW/cm2)

FIG. 2: Comparison of Rydberg excitation for the unblock-
aded (isolated atom) 30p state and the blockaded 70p and 80p
states at a peak density of 6.5 × 1010 cm−3. Irradiances are
scaled by (n*/30*)3 to account for the n dependence of the
electric dipole transition probability. Insets show the region
near the origin with an expanded scale. The dashed line for
n=30 is a least-squares ﬁt to the data, while the solid curves
for n=70 and n=80 are theoretical predictions, using a single
adjustable scaling parameter α as described in the text. To
account for the calculated eﬀects of slight variations in the
MOT cloud parameters, the n=30 results are multiplied by
1.29 (n=70 inset), 1.19 (n=80 inset) and 1.24 (main ﬁgure,
using the average correction for n=70,80).

at all intensities used, because for n=30 the vdW inter-
action is relatively weak. A linear ﬁt is combined with
calculations utilizing the 5s → 30p oscillator strength

quency chirp corresponding to the observed bandwidth.
The two calibrations agree within 2%, conﬁrming that we
can make accurate quantitative predictions of excitation
probabilities in the absence of a blockade.

The dependence of the Rydberg signal on the peak UV
irradiance is shown in Fig. 2 for n=30, 70 and 80. The
signal plotted is the fraction of the entire MOT sample
that is excited. For each n, the irradiance values are
scaled to n=30 by the factor (30*/n*)3 in order to ac-
count for the decrease in transition strength with increas-
ing n. Here n*=n − δ, and δ = 2.6415 is the quantum
defect for p3/2 states [15]. Note that the n=30 saturation
intensity for isolated atoms, deﬁned as that required for
an unchirped π-pulse in the center of the beam, is 0.36
MW/cm2. With this irradiance scaling, the various n’s
would fall on a universal isolated atom excitation curve if
the Rydberg levels were unshifted by atomic interactions.
This is seen to be the case for the very lowest intensities,
at which the Rydberg atoms are suﬃciently sparse that
interactions between them are negligible.

FIG. 1: Schematic of the experiment. Top: a UV laser beam
illuminates a sample of ultracold 85Rb atoms in order to excite
Rydberg atoms. Our theoretical model divides the region into
domains of radius Rd. Zoom: Within a given domain, any one
of the numerous ground-state atoms may be excited into a Ry-
dberg state. Inset: Because of strong Rydberg-Rydberg vdW
interactions, the mean-ﬁeld energy shift ε depends on the
particular location, as does the excitation probability |ce|2.
Atoms near the domain center are less shifted and their exci-
tation is more probable than those near the periphery. The
−3 and
graphs correspond to n=80 atoms at ρ = 6.5 × 1010 cm
scaled irradiance I = 0.187 MW/cm2.

the UV light is focused into the MOT cloud, yielding a
cylindrical excitation volume ∼500 µm long and ∼220
µm in diameter (FWHM). Within 60 ns after the laser
pulse, a ∼1500 V/cm electric ﬁeld is applied, ionizing the
Rydberg atoms and accelerating the ions towards a mi-
crochannel plate (MCP) detector. The trapping light is
turned oﬀ when the UV pulse arrives in order to prevent
direct photoionization from the 5p level.

The MCP is calibrated using two methods. The ﬁrst
is based on the signal from near-threshold photoioniza-
tion of the 5s ground state. The measured density dis-
tribution in the MOT, obtained from the trapped-atom
ﬂuorescence proﬁle, is combined with the measured UV
beam parameters and the known photoionization cross
section[12, 13] to calculate the number of photoions per
laser pulse. The second method is based on the n=30 Ry-
dberg signal, which behaves as isolated-atom excitation

The salient feature of Fig. 2 is the dramatic suppres-
sion of Rydberg excitation for n=70 and 80 relative to
the isolated atom (n=30) excitation curve. As expected,
the suppression is larger for n=80 due to its stronger
vdW interaction, reaching a factor of 6.4 at the highest
intensities shown.

We model the suppression of Rydberg excitation by
solving the Bloch equations for the ground-state and
excited-state amplitudes, cg and ce, of a given atom. The
key point is to include the energy level shift ε due to in-

ﬁrst-order shift due to its interaction ˆVint with |pki is

shift is dominated by the vdW interaction correspond-

g and 3Σ+

For simplicity, we consider a spherical domain of ra-
dius Rd and volume Vd which contains several atoms,
but by deﬁnition, only a single Rydberg atom |pii. All
other excited atoms, outside the domain, contribute to
the total shift of this Rydberg level εi = Σk6=i εki. The
shift of |pii, and therefore its probability of excitation,
depends upon its location within the domain, as shown
in the insets to Fig. 1. At the center of the sphere,
the distance from any other excited atom is maximized,
and the shift is therefore minimized. At the periphery
of the domain, the proximity of external Rydberg atoms
increases the shift, leading to a stronger suppression of
excitation. The domain radius Rd is determined from the
condition

d3r|ce(r, t)|2 = 1,

ρ

where ρ, the local density of atoms, is assumed uniform
within the domain. The amplitude ce(r, t) of an atom
located at r depends on its shift ε(r, t). In our mean-ﬁeld
model, we calculate this shift by replacing the discrete
sum by an integral over the excited atoms outside the
domain (V ′ = V −Vd) and considering their density ρe(t)
to be locally uniform:

The radius Rd and density ρe are related self-
consistently via ρeVd = 1. The shift of an atom located
at r = y Rd can be rewritten as

ε(y, t) = − ˜C6 g(y)/R6

where the eﬀective vdW coeﬃcient, ˜C6, and the spatial
variation of the shift, g(y) (with g(0) = 1), are obtained
by numerical integration of Eq. 2. Substituting

Using the adapted zeroth order wavefunctions for the
molecular states λ = 1 and 2 [9], and averaging over
for
projections mj of the excited states
atoms outside the domain and integrating over all pos-
sible angles of molecular axes, we ﬁnd ˜C6 = 7/60 C6.
By solving numerically Eqs. 5, we ﬁnd the local den-
sity of excited atoms ρe(ρ, Ω0) after the Gaussian laser
pulse of peak Rabi frequency Ω0 has ended. To com-
pare with the experimental measurements, this function
is averaged over the density and laser intensity proﬁles
in the trapped sample to provide the overall fraction of

The data and the predictions of the model described
above are compared in Fig. 2 for both n=70 and n=80.
We limit the scaled irradiance to less than 0.35 MW/cm2
because the validity of the model is questionable when
the isolated atom excitation approaches saturation. For
the curves shown, we have used a scaling factor α=2.4.
This reﬂects a possible underestimate of the absolute
atomic density ρ (known only to within a factor of two)
and/or the eﬀective C6 coeﬃcient. With this scaling fac-
tor, the agreement between the model and the data is
quite good. For n=80, we observe a maximum overall
suppression by a factor of 6.4 relative to isolated atom ex-
citation, and the theory indicates the suppression reaches
a factor of 19 in the center of the MOT.

We have also measured the excitation fraction as a
function of atomic density at a ﬁxed laser irradiance. The
density is varied by transiently transferring the popula-
tion between the two hyperﬁne levels of the ground state,
F =2 and F =3, which are separated by 3.0 GHz. Since
our UV laser bandwidth is very narrow, it excites selec-
tively from only one of these levels. Therefore, changing
their relative population immediately preceding the UV
pulse, while keeping other parameters of the MOT ﬁxed,
varies the eﬀective atomic density available for excita-
tion. This population transfer is due to the slow (∼100
µs ) optical pumping into F =2 which occurs when the
repumping laser is turned oﬀ before the trapping laser.
The extent of the transfer is controlled by the time inter-
val between switching oﬀ these two lasers. The eﬀective

to strong vdW interactions. The dependence of this
dramatic suppression on laser irradiance, atomic den-
sity, and principal quantum number are in good agree-
ment with a model based on a mean-ﬁeld treatment of
the atomic interactions. We have observed a sample-
averaged suppression by up to a factor of 6.4 relative to
isolated atom excitation. Increasing the atomic density
should result in signiﬁcantly larger suppressions. The
prospects of achieving a complete blockade in a micro-
scopic sample, such as at a single site in an optical lat-
tice, look very promising. For example, with a density of
1012 cm−3 and a laser bandwidth of 1 MHz, we conser-
vatively estimate that in a spherical sample of 50 atoms,
the probability of exciting more than one atom to n=80
is less than 1%. This would represent another important
step toward quantum computing with ultracold Rydberg
atoms.

FIG. 3: Density dependence of the n=80 Rydberg signal.
Relative densities are accurate to 5-10%, but the absolute
−3 at a relative density
peak density, nominally 6.5 × 1010 cm
of 1.0, is uncertain by as much as a factor of two. MOT
fractions are expressed in terms of the available ground-state
population in the selected hyperﬁne level (see text). The solid
curve shows the mean-ﬁeld theoretical prediction, using the
same scaling parameter as for Fig. 2.

density is measured by comparing the isolated atom sig-
nals from F =2 and F =3 to the n=30 state.

The measured excitation fraction for n=80 as a func-
tion of atomic density is shown in Fig. 3 along with the
prediction of the model. Note that the excitation fraction
is with respect to the number of atoms in the appropriate
hyperﬁne level. The scaling factor in the model is again
chosen to be α=2.4. Just as for the irradiance depen-
dence in Fig. 2, the data and the model agree quite well.
Note that in the absence of a blockade, one would expect
a constant excitation fraction (here 6.4%) instead of the
rapid decrease observed.

We have veriﬁed that the suppression of excitation we
have observed is not due to Stark shifts from charges cre-
ated during the UV laser pulse. At suﬃciently high inten-
sities, we do observe signiﬁcant numbers of free electrons
within 30 ns of a resonant excitation pulse. However,
at the maximum irradiance used in the present work,
5.1 MW/cm2 for n=80, we observe less than 100 such
electrons. In the worst case, if these electrons were all
produced during the laser pulse, the resulting average
microﬁeld would be less than 20 mV/cm. If all were to
leave the excitation volume, the space charge ﬁeld at its
edge would be ∼50 mV/cm. The resulting Stark shifts
for 80p are 0.9 MHz and 5.6 MHz, respectively, negligible
compared to the laser bandwidth of ∼100 MHz.

In conclusion, we have observed a local blockade of
Rydberg state excitation in a macroscopic sample due

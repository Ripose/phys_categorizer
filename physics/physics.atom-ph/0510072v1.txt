Conﬁguration interaction in many-electron atoms may cause anomalies in the ﬁne structure which
make the intervals small and very sensitive to variation of the ﬁne structure constant. Repeated
precision measurements of these intervals over long period of time can put strong constrain on
possible time variation of the ﬁne structure constant. We consider the 5p4 3P2,1,0 ﬁne structure
multiplet in the ground state of neutral tellurium as an example. Here the eﬀect of change of the
ﬁne structure constant is enhanced about one hundred times in the relative change of the small
energy interval between the 3P1 and 3P0 states.

INTRODUCTION

The possibility of fundamental constants to vary is pre-
dicted by theories unifying gravity with other interac-
tions (see, e.g. review by Uzan [1]). There is an evidence
found in quasar absorption spectra that the ﬁne struc-
ture constant α (α = e2/¯hc) might be smaller in early
cosmological epoch [2, 3, 4, 5]. However, similar analysis
applied by other authors to diﬀerent sets of data does not
support this claim [6, 7]. Recent progress in improving
atomic clocks and developing optical frequency standards
(see, e.g.
[8]) made it possible to put strong constrains
on possible time variation of fundamental constants in
laboratory measurements. In particular, constrains ob-
tained for the ﬁne structure constant α need only about
one order of magnitude improvement to see whether they
are consistent with the quasar absorption spectra data if
the same rate of change is assumed over cosmological
time. These constrains were obtained with the full use of
the technique developed for highly accurate optical stan-
dards. However, the choice of atomic transitions was not
optimal for searching of variation of the ﬁne structure
constant. Frequencies used so far change at about the
same rate as α if α changes, i.e.
there is no enhance-
ment.

An alternative approach was suggested in Refs.[9, 10].
It was proposed to measure small frequency between two
close states with diﬀerent dependence on α. Here small
change of α may lead to orders of magnitude larger rela-
tive change in frequency. The enhancement factor k can
be expressed as k = 2q12/ω, where q12 is the diﬀerence in
relativistic energy shifts of two levels and ω is transition
frequency. A good candidate for such experiments is dys-
prosium atom [9, 10, 11]. It has two almost degenerate
states of opposite parity and corresponding enhancement
factor is of order of 108 [10]. The measurements for dys-

prosium are currently underway at Berkeley [11].

While it is hard to ﬁnd anything better than dyspro-
sium in terms of enhancement factor, it has its disadvan-
tages too. The levels involved are not so narrow. While
one of the states lives long enough to cause no problem
the other level does not. One has to work inside the
line width to have the desirable accuracy. This puts cer-
tain limitations on achievable constrains on α-variation.
Therefore, it would be important to ﬁnd something which
combines the advantages of having metastable states and
strong enhancement. A number of such transitions were
considered in recent work [12].
It has been suggested
to look at close metastable states of diﬀerent conﬁgu-
rations. Energies of diﬀerent conﬁgurations change at
diﬀerent rates when α is changing. This, together with
small energy intervals between the states ensures strong
enhancement [12].

In present work we consider slightly diﬀerent possibil-
ity. We suggest to study anomalously small ﬁne struc-
ture intervals in ground conﬁgurations of many-electron
atoms. The use of the ground state ﬁne structure mul-
tiplet ensures that states are metastable. They can only
decay via M 1-transitions which are very much suppressed
due to small value of transition frequency. On the other
hand, conﬁguration interaction in many-electron atoms
can reduce ﬁne structure intervals and lead to strong sen-
sitivity to the change in the ﬁne structure constant. In
next sections we consider in detail ﬁne structure of the
ground state of tellurium and discuss some other possi-
bilities.

II. THEORY AND RESULTS FOR TELLURIUM

To study sensitivity of atomic frequencies to variation
of the ﬁne structure constant α it is convenient to present
them in the vicinity of the physical value of α (α = α0 =
1/137.036) in the form

ǫ = ǫ0 + qx,

(1)

where x = (α/α0)2 − 1 and coeﬃcient q deﬁnes the sen-
sitivity of the frequency to variation of α. In general, its
value can be found from atomic calculations. If α changes
the relative frequency changes at the rate

∆ω
ω

=

2q12
ω0

∆α

(2)

where k = 2q12/ω0 is enhancement factor. To search
for variation of the ﬁne structure constant one needs to
compare atomic frequencies with diﬀerent enhancement
factors over long period of time. The larger this diﬀerence
the more sensitive the experiment to variation of α. Note
that k can have negative value which means that changes
of α and frequency go in opposite directions: frequency
decreases when α increases and vise versa.

For “normal” ﬁne structure intervals which are pro-
portional to (Zα)2 formula (1) is valid for all values of
α, 0 < α < α0. Therefore, q12 = ω0 and k = 2.
In
other words, the factor k is the same for all “normal” ﬁne
structure intervals and comparison between them cannot
reveal any drift of α. These ﬁne structure intervals can
still be used in search for variation of the fundamental
constants if they are compared to hyperﬁne structure or
to frequencies of suitable optical transitions.

Situation changes dramatically if ﬁne structure mul-
tiplet is strongly perturbed by conﬁguration interaction
with neighboring states. We consider neutral tellurium
atom in its ground state as an example.

Experimental and theoretical energies of the ground
state 5p4 conﬁguration of tellurium are presented in Ta-
ble I. There are strong anomalies in the ﬁne structure
multiplet 3P2,1,0. The 3P2 - 3P1 and 3P1 - 3P0 inter-
vals have opposite signs and diﬀer in value more than
hundred times. This is because of conﬁguration inter-
action between the 3P2 and 1D2 states and between the
3P0 and 1S0 states while the 3P1 state has no close neigh-
bors to mix with. Conﬁguration interaction leads to acci-
dental almost exact cancellation between spin-orbit and
Coulomb terms in the energy interval between the 3P1
and 3P0 states. Since spin-orbit interaction is much more
sensitive to the change of α than the Coulomb term, it
is natural to expect that the 3P1 - 3P0 energy interval is
very sensitive to the variation of α.

To check how strong is sensitivity of the ﬁne structure
intervals of Te I we perform model conﬁguration inter-
action (CI) calculations for the 5p4 conﬁguration of the
atom. First, we perform Hartree-Fock calculations for
open shells to ﬁnd the 5p1/2 and 5p3/2 states of neutral
tellurium. Then we use the CI technique to construct
four-electron states of the 5p4 conﬁguration and to cal-
culate their energies (in fact, in this approximation CI
technique is reduced to diagonalization of the interac-
tion Hamiltonian describing direct mixing of diﬀerent 5p4
states). It turns out that some extra ﬁtting is needed to
have good agreement with experiment. Namely, we re-
duce the value of the F2(5p3/2, 5p3/2) Coulomb integral
by 25%. This reduction simulates the eﬀect of screen-
ing of Coulomb interaction between valence electrons by

core electrons. The results for energies are presented in
Table I. One can see that in spite of simple approxima-
tion used in calculations the agreement with experiment
is very good.

Coeﬃcients q (see Eq.(1)) are found by varying α in

computer codes:

q =

ǫ(x = +0.1) − ǫ(x = −0.1)
0.2

.

The results for q are also presented in Table I. Since
we have good agreement with experiment for the ener-
gies it is natural to assume that the accuracy for the
q-coeﬃcients is also good.

Table II presents frequencies and enhancement factors
for transitions between all states of the 3P0,1,2 ﬁne struc-
ture multiplet. The enhancement for the 3P1 − 3P0
is more than one hundred due to anomalously small fre-
quency of the transition. Ratio of this small frequency
to almost any other atomic frequency is extremely sen-
sitive to variation of α. However, other transitions from
Table II can also be used.

Because of very exotic behavior of the ﬁne structure in-
tervals of Te I it is very interesting to see what happens
to them when α varies from zero (non-relativistic limit)
to its physical value α0. We have performed such calcu-
lations and results for ﬁve low states of the 5p4 ground-
state conﬁguration of Te I are presented on Fig. 1. Va-
lence energies (energy to remove all four valence electrons
from atom) are shown as functions of (α/α0)2. All three
energies of the 3P0,1,2 multiplet have the same value at
α = 0 and ﬁne structure intervals are proportional to α2
at small α. At larger values of α interaction with the 1D2
and 1S0 leads to signiﬁcant perturbation of the 3P mul-
tiplet. In particular, repulsion between the 1S0 and 3P0
levels causes the latter to cross with the 3P1 level in the
vicinity of the physical value of α. This explains anoma-

lously small energy interval between the two states.

Let us mention in the end of this section that both
upper states of the 3P multiplet are metastable. The
3P1 state decays mostly by M1 transition to the ground
state. Its lifetime is about 1 sec. The 3P0 state decays
via E2 transition to the ground state and corresponding
lifetime (if no other factors are involved) is about 4 × 103
sec.

III. POLONIUM AND CERIUM

There are many other examples of the anomalous ﬁne
structure in the ground and low excited states of many-
electron atoms which involve metastable states and large
enhancement and therefore suitable for search of varia-
tion of the ﬁne structure constant. The actual choice
between them would involve consideration of many other
factors which are important for experimentalists but not
discussed in present paper. Below we discuss two more
examples just to have broader picture.

Brief look at the spectra of elements presented in
Moore’s tables [13] reveals that practically all elements
with the np4 conﬁguration in the ground state have
anomalies in the ﬁne structure (though none of them has
so small energy interval as Te I). The most interesting
case after Te I is probably polonium (Po I). It has the
largest nuclear charge Z (Z = 84) among the np4 ele-
ments which mean strong relativistic eﬀects and large q
and k coeﬃcients (see formulas (1) and (2)). Experimen-
tal and theoretical data similar to those considered for

Te I are presented in Tables III and IV. We see that en-
hancement factors k are large and diﬀerent for diﬀerent
transitions. This is exactly what is needed for the search
of variation of the ﬁne structure constant.

Another interesting example is the positive ion of
cerium (Ce II). An extract from the tables [14] presenting
experimental energies and g-factors Lande of lower states
of Ce II are presented in Table V together with non-
relativistic (NR) values of the g-factors. Non-relativistic
g-factors were calculated according to the formula

g = 1 +

J(J + 1) − L(L + 1) + S(S + 1)
2J(J + 1)

.

(3)

The data presented in Table V reveals an interest-
ing picture. Fine structure multiplets of Ce II inter-
sect. There are many states with the same total mo-
mentum J within an energy interval spanned by singe
ﬁne structure multiplet. For example, there are four(!)
states of J = 4.5 within energy interval of the lowest
ﬁne structure multiplet 4Ho. It is clear that they must
be strongly mixed. Fine structure intervals do not obey
Lande’s rule and experimental g-factors deviate signiﬁ-
cantly from the non-relativistic values. All these suggest
strong conﬁguration mixing and sensitivity of the inter-
vals to variation of α. An interval of particular interest
is the 4Ho
9/2 one. It is small, only 299 cm−1
and states involved are strongly mixed with other close
states. This ensures strong enhancement of the change
of α in the relative change of frequency.

11/2 − 4Ho

Calculations for Ce II are more diﬃcult than for Te I
and Po I because of valence states of high angular mo-
mentum (5d and 4f ). Therefore we believe that it is
premature to attempt them now. The presence of en-
hancement is obvious but its actual value would become
important only on the stage of planning the measure-
ments. We are ready to perform the calculations if there
is any interest from experimentalists.

Cases of ﬁne structure anomalies similar to what is
presented here for Ce II can be easily fond in spectra
of many other rare-earth elements. Which of them are
suitable for the search of α variation is the question which
needs further consideration.

IV. CONCLUSION

surements. We propose to use ﬁne structure intervals in
the ground or low excited states of many-electron atoms
which are strongly perturbed by conﬁguration interac-
tion with neighboring states. This method has double
advantages. On one hand, the use of low states ensures
that they are metastable. This is important for very
accurate frequency measurements. On the other hand,
strong perturbation may lead to anomalously small ﬁne
structure interval and strong enhancement of the rela-
tive sensitivity of the frequencies to the change of the
ﬁne structure constant. Because of the high relative sen-
sitivity one does need extremely accurate absolute mea-
surements of the frequencies (this is the diﬀerence with
conventional atomic clock measurements). Large value of
the eﬀect/frequency ratio may also help to reduce impor-
tance of some systematic eﬀects (e.g. the Doppler shift
and broadening). Note, however, that we do not consider
in this paper any practical measurement scheme.

Enhanced and highly non-linear dependence of the
small ﬁne structure intervals on the magnitude of the
relativistic corrections also presents certain theoretical
interest.

Abstract. We extend a recently introduced mapping model, which explains the
bunching phenomenon in an ion beam resonator for two ions [Geyer, Tannor, J.
Phys. B 37 (2004) 73], to describe the dynamics of the whole ion bunch. We
calculate the time delay of the ions from a model of the bunch geometry and ﬁnd
that the bunch takes on a spherical form at the turning points in the electrostatic
mirrors. From this condition we describe, how the observed bunch length depends
on the experimental parameters. We give an interpretation of the criteria for
the bunch’s existence, which were derived from the experimental observations by
Pedersen et al [Pedersen et al , Phys. Rev. A 65 042704].

1. Introduction

From ion traps one usually expects that they keep a number of ions localized in a
volume deﬁned by their — sometimes not so simple — set of electromagnetic ﬁelds.
The ions, on the other hand, try to escape, partly due to their kinetic energy and
partly due to their mutual repulsion. But recently a surprising cooperative behavior
of the ions was discovered in a Zajfman trap [1], an ion trap resonator built of two
opposite electrostatic mirrors and two focussing lenses [2]: the ions are injected into
the trap from an ion beam and this injected bunch of ions bounces back and forth
between the two mirrors but does not diﬀuse in the trap. The ions, which all have the
same charge and also slightly diﬀerent energies and trajectories through the trap, seem
to “stick together”; they are eﬀectively trapped inside the bunch. This “dynamical
trap”, the ion bunch, behaves as if it were a macroscopic super particle.

As a ﬁrst application of the Zajfman trap operating in this bunching regime a high

resolution spectrometer has been demonstrated with a resolution of ∆m/m
[3]. This value was until now only achieved in storage rings [4].

The operating regime of the trap and the stability conditions, under which this
counter intuitive “self–bunching”, or synchronization, occurs, were ﬁrst explained by
Strasser et al [3] by relating the ion dynamics to the so called negative mass instability
[5]: due to the special dispersion of the trap the period of an ion increases with its

energy. This can be described by a negative eﬀective mass of the ions. Consequently
the ions have to repel each other in order to synchronize their motion.

A microscopic explanation of the observed synchronization for two identical ions
was given by the authors in reference [6], which we refer to as “part I” in the
following: the problem is described by a set of simple mappings for the evolution
of the ions’ relative coordinate through the diﬀerent parts of the trap. The ions’
interaction is incorporated phenomenologically as a time delay. With this approach we
not only conﬁrm the already known stability conditions but describe the microscopic
process taking place: synchronization is a continued alternation of energy and position
exchange between the two ions.

In this paper we show how the model of two identical ions can be generalized
to describe the dynamics of the whole bunch. For this we associate one of the ions
with a “test ion”, which moves through the cloud of the other ions, and the other
describes the motion of the bunch’s CM. With the two identical ions we did not need
to specify the interaction to explain the mechanism, but now the interaction potential
it is derived from of the
that the test ion feels is an important part of the eﬀect:
charge distribution in the bunch, i.e., the test ion’s averaged position in the bunch,
but it also determines its motion inside the bunch.

This test ion case is a specialization as well as a generalization of the two identical
ions description: by specifying the interaction we can describe the generalized behavior
of arbitrary many ions. We therefore ﬁrst repeat in section 2 the basics of the two
ions case, before section 3 describes how the bunch geometry is incorporated. In this
section the central result of a spherical bunch at the turning point is derived, too. The
dependence of the bunch length on the various parameters of the trap and the ions
is illustrated in section 4. Then, in section 5 we show, how the criteria for bunching,
which were deducted from the experimental observations by Pedersen et al [7], are
connected to our explanations. The results are summarized and further developments
are sketched in section 6.

2. The mapping model

2.1. The ions in the trap

The trap and the experimental ﬁndings about the ions’ behavior were described in
detail in references [7] and [8] and the mapping model for two identical ions was
introduced and explained in [6].

We start from this two ion description with the simpliﬁed trap:

F is the constant gradient of the mirror ﬁeld.

In general the two ions have masses m1 and m2 and charges q1 and q2, respectively.
As synchronization shows up in the distance between the ions, we use center of mass
(CM) and relative coordinates. With the total mass M = m1 + m2 and the reduced
mass µ = m1m2

m1+m2 they are deﬁned as

R and P are the CM coordinate and momentum, respectively; the relative motion is
described by x and p. The ions’ positions and momenta are denoted by x1, p1 and x2,
p2.

With the ion–ion interaction W (x) the Hamiltonian for these two ions reads

To separate CM and relative coordinates when both ions are in the same part of the
trap potential we need that q1V (x1) + q2V (x2) = (q1 + q2)V (R). With the potential of
equation (1) we get the condition that both ions must have the same charge to mass
ratio:

q1m2 −
M

q2m1

⇔

q1

=

q2
m2

For two identical ions this condition is trivially fulﬁlled. Here we describe a bunch of
N + 1 identical ions; then the above condition is also fulﬁlled, when we use one of the
ions as a test ion of mass m and charge q and identify the other with the remaining
N identical ions of the bunch:

m1 = m m2 = N m
q1 = q

q2 = N q

The number of ions N is consequently a positive integer, which can be N = 1, too.
Now, with M = (N +1)m and µ = N
N +1 m, the CM and relative coordinates (equations
(2) and (3)) specify as:

In reference [6] we combined the geometry of the trap and the ions’ mass and
energy into two parameters, which are derived from the times that the ions spend in
the mirror, i.e., at

> L/2, and in the central part of the trap, respectively.

It turns out that not the times themselves but their ratio α — the second

2.2. The momentum kick and the mappings

In our model potential the CM and the relative motion separate for nearly all the time,
except for a short interval τk. This is the time between when the ﬁrst ion crosses the
L
kink between the ﬂat part and one of the mirrors at
2 and when the second one
passes that point, too. During that time the ions are accelerated relative to each other
by the trap potential. For the case of ions going into the mirror at x = L/2 it is:

As τk is short the relative distance x does not change during this time in our
approximation, also the ions’ very weak interaction can be neglected [6]. This sudden
of the relative
change of the momentum (19) can be formulated as a mapping
distance and momentum x and p just before this kick onto the values x′ and p′ right

2.3. The ion–ion interaction and the stability condition

As shown in part I [6] the ions’ motion is synchronized by their repulsion, when the
ions interact in the mirror. Without further specifying the form of the interaction
potential we can model its eﬀect by a time delay τm, that aﬀects the relative motion
when the ions’ paths cross each other. After including τm into the mirror mapping as

The eigenvalues λ1/2 (25) are complex for 0 < γ < 1. Then the test ion is stably
synchronized with the bunch [9] — which then will be stable, as the test ion describes
the motion of all the other ions in the bunch, too. This requires that the dispersion
be positive, i.e., α < 1, and the delay in the mirror is positive, τm > 0. For a negative
delay, τm < 0, which would lead to synchronization for α > 1, in general an attractive
interaction is necessary, which does not occur for equally charged ions.

We will in the following only consider the case of α < 1 and τm > 0, i.e., the
interaction between the test ion and the other ions of the bunch is repulsive and it
takes place around the bunch’s turning point in the mirror.

2.4. The spatial dispersion of the trap

There is yet another diﬀerence between our one dimensional model and the real trap
that we need to include: in the real trap even two ions with exactly the same energy
may have diﬀerent periods, as the length of their orbits varies with the radial distance
from the trap’s central axis. Pedersen et al characterized this spread of isoenergetic
periods by a time diﬀerence ∆Ti [1].
If this spread is too big, synchronization is
suppressed in the experiment.

As our one dimensional model does not allow for oﬀ–axis orbits, we include
this spread as an externally given parameter in the following way, explained for two
identical ions: In the central part Tf is eﬀectively independent of whether a given
trajectory lies on or oﬀ the trap’s central axis. So this diﬀerence in the period is
accumulated in the mirrors. There a delay τi of one of the two ions with respect to
the other due to the spatial dispersion leads to a bigger separation between the ions,
which is equal to extending the time that the CM spends inside the mirror by τi
2 ; if
the total spread after one period is ∆Ti = 2τi we consequently have to replace the
4 . This is valid for a test ion and the bunch,
time interval Tm in
too. The mirror’s mapping then takes on the following form:

(29)

The stability is independent of the time spread ∆Tv (see [1]) caused by the ﬁnite
energy resolution of the ion source: when the two ions are in the synchronized mode
they oscillate around each other, exchanging momentum all the time. Therefore even a
beam which had been injected without any energy spread is “heated up” corresponding
to its length, as explained in reference [6] and ﬁgure 1. The energy spread of the initial
injected bunch can be seen as a snapshot of the diﬀerent ions somewhere on their orbit
around the bunch’s CM.

This heating is related to the time delay τm, which we will determine in the
following section. When we then have actual numbers for τm we will calculate the
bunch’s phase space volume.

3. Estimating the bunch length

To explain the observed synchronization in the two ion model of part I it was suﬃcient
that the ions experience a time delay, when their paths cross in the mirror. The
magnitude of this delay did not matter, only its sign.

Synchronization in the ”Zajfman trap” II

Figure 1. The phase space positions of the ions in the injected bunch (a) serve
as starting points for the ions’ oscillations around the bunch’s center in the stable
regime (b): no matter how small the energy (momentum) spread of the ion source
is (a), the bunch’s internal energy in the trap depends on its length.

Figure 2. The ions’ motion in the mirror is divided into three stages: (i) while the
bunch penetrates into the mirror the bunch contracts, but the ions do not change
their relative ordering. (ii) When the bunch has reached its minimal length A at
the turning point the ions cross over the potential barrier to the other side and
(iii) on its way out of the mirror the bunch expands again symmetric to (i). The
behavior of the explicitly denoted test ion is representative for the motion of all
the other ions.

From the above explanations we conclude that the bunching phenomenon is more
stable against perturbations, when the time delay is larger:
the observed bunch
consequently will be this conﬁguration, which maximizes the delay for the given
experimental parameters.

Now, to set up a quantitative description of the experiment we calculate the
length of the bunch that is observed in the experiment at the pickup and explain its
dependencies on the various parameters. We therefore have to relate the time delay
to the bunch length.

For this we use the modiﬁed two ion model: one of the ions with a mass m1 = m is
the test ion. It moves relative to the bunch’s CM, where the other ion with m2 = N m
is located. The test ion then moves inside a potential, which is the convolution of
the bunch’s charge distribution and the Coulomb interaction between the test ion and
each of the other ions of the bunch. We therefore describe the form of the bunch by
its charge distribution.

3.1. The minimal bunch length

The central process — the delaying of the test ion — takes place when the bunch
turns around in the mirror. We therefore have to relate the length A of the bunch at
the turning point to the length Lb, which can be observed in the central part of the
trap.

Synchronization in the ”Zajfman trap” II

8

We again start from non interacting ions. Then we can divide the bunch’s
behavior in the mirror into three distinct steps, see ﬁgure 2: (i) when the bunch
enters the mirror the ions get a compressing momentum kick, which for each ion is
proportional to its distance from the CM, see equation (19). With the macroscopic
length of the bunch the momentum kick is much bigger than the spread of the ions’
momentum in the central part of the trap. Therefore, to a very good approximation,
the ions do not change their relative order, while the bunch contracts to some minimal
length, shortly before the CM turns around in the mirror. Then the second stage takes
place while the CM turns around: (ii) the ions move through the now (stationary)
bunch to the other side. After that, in the third stage, (iii), the bunch expands again
on its way out of the mirror, until the second kick at the exit of the mirror undoes the
ﬁrst momentum kick and stops the expansion.

When the interaction is weak compared to the momentum kick, then this three
stage process will pertain. But now the ions feel the potential, when they pass
through the bunch in the second stage: they are slowed down and therefore delayed.
Consequently the time delay and, therefore, all properties of the stable bunch are
determined by its geometry at the turning point.

For non interacting ions the length of the bunch in time is the same both at the
observed Lb and at the minimal length A. It is identical with the time interval τk,
which deﬁnes the momentum kick (17), expressed here with the average momentum
p0:

The minimal length of the bunch occurs when the CM turns around in the mirror.
Then the ﬁrst ion, being in front by τk, has already returned from the turning point

Here we assume that the mirror potential at the turning point is linear over the

For the following we use the special form of our model potential (1) and come back
to the general form only after we analyzed the behavior of the observed bunch in our
model potential. Then equation 32 becomes:

With the values of the initial experiment [1], i.e., Ar+ ions with E0 = 4.2 keV and
F = 80keV/m, a bunch of, e.g., Lb = 2 cm is compressed to A = 0.95 mm.

With the linear slopes of our model potential the bunch is contracted linearly
during the ﬁrst stage. Therefore an arbitrary position x inside the uncompressed
bunch of length Lb is transformed into xi in the contracted bunch, i.e., when it has
the length A, as:

xi =

In the two ion case [6] there was no need for some minimal length, as the crossing
time of two ions is always well deﬁned, but for many ions the spatial extension of the
continuous bunch translates into a length in time, during which the ions cross the
bunch.

3.2. Calculating the delay

According to the above explained three stage description we have to deal with the
following process: (i) the linear contraction translates an ion from a position x in the
expanded bunch to the position xi in the contracted bunch (34). (ii) Only from this
position the ion starts to cross over the now stationary bunch potential to the other
xi, where the linear interaction free expansion picks it up again
side until it reaches
(iii).

−

Consequently the time delay τm due to the repulsive bunch potential is deﬁned
as the diﬀerence between the time T that the test ion needs to cross over the bunch
of minimal length A, starting from an initial position xi up to the symmetric distance

xi, and T0, the time needed for the same distance 2xi without any potential:

−

τm = T

T0 =

p(xi)/m

(35)

Please note that with the interaction the spatially symmetric positions xi and
xi are not reached at times symmetric to Tm/2; all ions are delayed in the central
−
stage, consequently they all reach their symmetric position on the other side of the
bunch later than without interaction. The third expanding stage only starts, when
all ions have changed to their respective side of the bunch. Of course, this separation
into three successive stages is an idealization, which will not be observed strictly in
the experiment.

To calculate the times T and T0 we need the explicit form of the bunch potential

and the momentum of the ion at the end of the ﬁrst stage, i.e., at xi.

We start with the momentum: it is the sum of the ion’s initial momentum relative
to the CM in the central part of the trap plus the momentum kick at the position
x. For a macroscopic bunch the kick is much bigger than the momentum spread: an
energy spread of 10 eV in the central part at an ion energy of 4.2 keV corresponds to a
momentum spread of about 5.7 a.u. for Ar+ ions; during the time Tm this momentum
diﬀerence widens the bunch by about 0.25 mm, much less than the distance 2Lb of
a few cm, which is traversed during the same time due to the momentum kick. We
consequently neglect the momentum spread and calculate the ions’ energy relative to
the CM from the kick alone.

The momentum change of one ion relative to the bunch at the position x due to

the kick was shown to be (equation (19) with µ = m)

T0 is independent of xi because due to the linear contraction of the bunch the

3.3. Modelling the bunch potential

To calculate the time T that the test ion needs to pass over the bunch we need the
ions’ distribution in the bunch. From this we calculate the bunch potential and then
the delay, which in turn discerns, if this speciﬁc bunch is stable. But if it is not stable
for all xi, the ions will redistribute, adapting the bunch potential. In a more exact
treatment the bunch potential would have to be iterated so that for all ions in all parts
of the bunch the stability criterion is fulﬁlled.

To keep the description simple we will not allow for an arbitrary bunch form but
explicitly make the (mean ﬁeld) ansatz that the ions are distributed Gaussian around
the CM all of the time, i.e., in the central part of the trap and during the whole
evolution through the mirror. With this assumption we only need one parameter to
describe the width of the bunch. The charge density ρ(x) of the contracted bunch
then will be, with the total number of ions N in the bunch and its width A at the
turning point:

The ”softcore parameter” or ”impact parameter” d is a measure for how close the ions
have to come when passing each other; it describes the radius of the ion beam in the
trap potential.

We could now insert this potential into (35), but then the delay for a speciﬁc ion

3.4. More insight: Linearizing τm

From the expressions for τm according to (35), (38), (46) and (47) we could
now calculate numerically the time delay and learn about its behavior. But
these expressions are too complex to easily “see” the dependencies on the various
parameters. They can be simpliﬁed by expanding both the Arsinh and the square
root in equation (46). This approximation is valid for Lbmω
4p0, i.e., when the
ions’ energy from the momentum kick is much higher than necessary to cross the
bunch. Then the resulting delay is also small. From equations (39), (41) and (43) we
see that Wb, and therefore ω, scales linearly with N . When we keep N low enough
this condition is fulﬁlled even for a short bunch or a thin beam.

The ﬁrst summand in the second line equals T0 (38). With equations (10), (33) and

Finally two degrees of freedom are left, which the bunch can adjust to achieve the
most stable conﬁguration, i.e., the biggest τm: the number of ions N and its length
A. All other quantities have been ﬁxed by the experimentator.

From (51) it is readily seen that the delay is proportional to the number of ions

N in the bunch:

τm ∝

N

The bunch can consequently stabilize itself by taking up more ions; or, put the other
way, the bunch has the tendency to keep all ions together. It is stable with respect to
the number of ions.

The dependence of τm on the beam diameter d and the bunch length A at the
turning point in the mirror is less obvious, but if there is a “most eﬃcient” value of
A, i.e., for which the delay is maximal for a given d, then for this conﬁguration the
derivative ∂τm

∂A vanishes.

the potential is ﬂatter and slows down the ions less, whereas in a shorter bunch the
distance 2xi, over which the delay is accumulated, shrinks faster than the increasing
eﬀect of the steeper potential barrier.

delay scales with the most important parameters:

τm ∝

A3/2 ∝

d3/2

To arrive at equation (51), which is independent of the ions’ initial conditions
and is “local in the turning point”, it was important that both the top of the bunch
potential and the ions’ energy relative to the CM had the same quadratic dependence
on the distance from the bunch’s center. This is a consequence of the constant slopes
of the mirror ﬁelds. But if the mirror is not linear, the bunch’s potential at the turning
point can still be expanded as in equation (42). If the bunch is not contracted linearly
from Lb into A in the real experiment’s mirror ﬁeld, then the energy ǫ(xi) of the ions
will not be quadratic in xi, but in any case it is a symmetric function of the distance
from the CM. It can therefore at least be approximated by a quadratic dependence.
Consequently the central importance of the turning point will not vanish, though τm
then depends on xi, but the delay is still maximal for A

d.

With the above result, i.e., by setting A = d, we can use the transformation (32)

For the deﬁnition of Xm see (11). In our model trap Lb is determined solely by the
geometric trap parameters at the bunch’s turning point. The position Xm of the
turning point itself is of course determined by the ions’ energy. There a spherical
bunch is formed, which is then “projected out” into the trap’s central region.

With the numerical values of the experiment, i.e., E0 = 4.2 keV, q = +1 and
F = 80 keV
m we get Xm = 5.25 cm. In reference [7] a beam radius of d = 0.5 mm was
derived from trajectory calculations. These trajectory calculations also had predicted
a spherical bunch at the turning point. With this value of d we predict an observed
bunch length in the central part of the trap of Lb = 1.45 cm. Ar+ ions with the above
E0 = 4.2 keV have a speed of v0 = 14.2 cm
µs , our Lb therefore corresponds to a length
in the time domain of Wb = 0.1 µs. For comparison Pedersen et al measured a value
of Wb ≈
The greatest uncertainty in comparing our results to the measurements stems
from the greatly simpliﬁed form of our model potential. In the experiment only the
voltage on one of the ﬁve electrodes was varied, we can therefore not expect that the
resulting ﬁeld is linear. Due to geometrical limitations, i.e., the length L of the trap
is ﬁxed and the maximal Xm is limited in the experiment, it will be diﬃcult to check
the validity of equations (58) or (59) over a wide range of parameters. Also the beam
at the turning point have to be

From the condition (27) that 4Xm > L — which is another way of expressing the
bunching criterion α < 1 — we see that there is a minimal bunch length determined

Note that though the delay, a dynamical property, increases with the number of ions
in the bunch 57, the observed Lb itself is independent of N in this approximation and
only determined by external parameters.

4. Numerical evaluation: Behavior of the time delay

Now we have all parts together to actually evaluate the time delay and take a look at
its behavior.

The delay depends on a number of parameters, some of which are “externally
given” and others describe how the bunch “reacts” to this environment: the size L
of the trap, the energy E0, the charge q and the mass m of the ions and the slope of
the mirror ﬁelds F are ﬁxed. Derived from those are the momentum p0 = √2mE0,
the time Tm (10) and the dispersion parameter α (13), which we consider ﬁxed, too.
In the following these quantities will be set to their respective experimental values of
E0 = 4.2 keV, F = 80 kV/m, q = +1 and m = 40 amu, which were used in the initial
experimental discovery of the bunching eﬀect [1]. With these values we get Tm = 1.48
µs and α = 0.956.

On the other hand we have the number of ions in the bunch N , the observed
length Lb and the length A in the mirror. There is no constraint on these quantities,
so the bunch will try to adjust them to achieve the most stable conﬁguration possible
in the given trap regime. The two lengths, Lb and A, are not independent, though.
They are connected to each other by a unique transformation (32), determined by
the mirror potential. When the central process of the ions crossing the bunch takes
place, the bunch is characterized by its minimal length A, therefore this length is
more important; Lb is merely the projection of this contracted length out of the
mirror. Therefore we expect the absolute values which we predict for the observed Lb
not to be exact, but we expect that the important dependencies, governed by A, are
reproduced.

The parameters we mentioned up to now are easily classiﬁed as given or
dependent. The last parameter, the radius of the beam d, has a special role: it belongs
to the group of ﬁxed quantities, as it is determined by the electrostatic potentials on
the mirror electrodes, but in our treatment it appears as a constituent of the bunch
potential Wb (41); it is closely intertwined with A, as we have seen above. We already
know from equation (54) that the delay is maximal for A
d, but in the following
numerical illustrations we will treat A and d as independent parameters — just to see
our results of the previous section conﬁrmed.

≈

4.1. Time delay vs. minimal length

First we look at the time delay as a function of the bunch length A for ﬁxed N and a
given d. We evaluate equations (38), (46) and (47) with N = 106 for three values of d
— 200 µm, 500 µm and 1000 µm — and plot the results in ﬁgure 3. For short bunches,
i.e., small A, and for long bunches the delay is small with a maximum inbetween. This
maximum of τm occurs around A = d, where the length and the width of the bunch
are about equal. This is exactly the behavior predicted in the previous section.

The linearized results (51) are indiscernible from the full solution for the
parameters used in ﬁgure 3; they diﬀer by less than one percent for small A and
coincide for larger A.

Figure 3. Time delay calculated from(38) and (46) for a constant number of ions
N = 106 and ﬁxed beam diameters of d =200µm (- - -), 500 µm (— - —) and
1000 µm (——). The arrows indicate for each curve where the bunch length is
equal to the beam diameter, i.e., A = d. The thin broken curve plots the weighted
average of the delay from the equations of motion with the full bunch potential,
i.e., without the harmonic approximation (42).

The behavior of τ (A) can be understood in the following way: the time delay is
determined by two factors: the height of the bunch potential Wb (41) and the length
2xi (34) of the potential barrier that the ions have to cross over. When the contracted
bunch is very long then the resulting low potential barrier only has a small eﬀect.
When the bunch is short, then the barrier is high, slowing down the ion much more,
but as xi is small, the fraction of time spent passing over the bunch is small, too,
and therefore the resulting delay is small. Of course, somewhere inbetween these two
extremal cases there has to be a maximum, apparently when the bunch is spherical
at the turning point.

One might argue that for very short bunches the potential barrier should ﬁnally
become so high that the ions come to a stop on top of the barrier. Then the delay
would be high, too. But it is not only the length A of the bunch, which determines
the potential’s form, but also its width d: the curvature mω2 (43) at the potential top
is limited by the wider of the two functions contributing to Wb (see equation (41), be
this the Gaussian ion distribution or the softcore Coulomb interaction.

To check the validity of our harmonic approximation to the potential (42) we
also solved the equations of motion for ions starting at various xi on the full potential
(41). From these delays the average, weighted with the ion density ρ(xi) (39), was
calculated for d = 500µm. It is shown as the thin broken curve in ﬁgure 3, which
has its maximum at the same position and deviates only slightly from the harmonic
approximation.

For A = d = 1 mm the delay τm is plotted against the starting position xi in ﬁgure
ﬁgure 4. For comparison also the contracted longitudinal bunch proﬁle ρ(xi) is shown.
We see that τm decays much slower with increasing distance xi from the bunch’s center
than ρ(xi): at xi = 2.5 mm, where the bunch density becomes negligible, τm is still
half of the maximal value close to the center. Consequently most of the ions have a τm

When we now keep the bunch length ﬁxed and vary the beam diameter, ﬁgure 5, the
maximum of the delay for a spherical bunch shows up again. For the three bunch
lengths shown in ﬁgure 5 the delay decreases with increasing beam diameter, but for
each Lb — and the corresponding A — there is a point, where the delay is higher than
for shorter or longer bunches. Consequently all possible delays are smaller than the
ones from A = d, which is indicated by the solid enveloping line according to equation
(57).

number of ions N . The thin solid lines indicate in (a) the linear relation between
τm and N (53) and in (b) the constant A = d (51) according to the linearized
solution.

From this plot it can be seen, too, that when the spatial dispersion requires a
minimal delay of, e.g., 0.025 ns, i.e., ∆Ti = 0.05 ns, then the beam has to be focussed
to a radius of less than 1 mm — and in the real experiment to an even smaller value.

4.3. The conﬁguration of maximal delay

Another view of the time delay’s behavior is given in ﬁgure 6. Now for given N and
d the bunch length A is optimized to maximize the time delay. Panel (a) plots the
obtained delay and (b) the length A for this maximal τm, both vs. N and for two
diﬀerent values of d.

For small N the delay grows linear with N while the most eﬃcient A is constant,
slightly higher than d. This behavior was already derived in equation (57). Then,
above a certain N the delay grows faster than linear while A shrinks. This happens
when the height of the potential barrier becomes comparable and ﬁnally higher than
the ions’ energy relative to the CM. At this point, where Lbmω = 4p0, our formula
for the crossing time T (46), and therefore the validity of (57), breaks down, as the
argument of the square root becomes negative. Now the ions bounce back from the
bunch potential and do not reach the other side any more.

Consequently there are — for a given d — two limits for the number of ions in a
bunch: the lower limit is determined by the minimal delay necessary to compensate
for the spatial dispersion ∆Ti and the maximal N stems from the requirement that the

t
Synchronization in the ”Zajfman trap” II

18

ions have to be able to pass over the contracted bunch’s potential. From the minimal
density to well below the maximal N the bunch length is in our model independent
of the number of ions.

This is consistent with the experimental observation that the bunch length is
essentially independent of the density of the injected ion beam over at least three
orders of magnitude.

As τm increases with N the bunch is stable against emitting ions, it will even try
to capture ions which come “close enough” in phase space. The size of this “capture
area” in phase space can be estimated as explained in the next section.

4.4. Energy spread of the conﬁned bunch

In section 2.4 we stated that the bunch is heated up to a speciﬁc energy spread in the
trap by the momentum kicks from the trap potential, no matter how small the initial
energy spread at injection time had been. This externally determined energy spread
corresponds to a volume in phase space that the bunch covers; ions which, for some
reason, enter this region are trapped in the bunch.

In our harmonic approximation τm is a constant for all ions in the bunch (see
sections 3.3 and 4.1). To calculate this energy spread we can therefore use a relation
between the maximal distance xmax between the two ions and their maximal relative
momentum pmax, which was derived in part I from the composite mapping for a half
period

′1/2 (24) (equation (37) of reference [6]) with a constant τm:

We again plug in the numbers from the original experiment, i.e., Tm = 1.48 µs,
µ = m = 40 amu and α = 0.956 and read an ǫ = τm
5 at Lb = 2 cm for
N = 106 ions from ﬁgure 3.

Tm ≈

10−

With these values and xmax = Lb we get ∆p = pmax = 13.7 au, which translates
m = 0.89 au = 24 eV at a

into an energy spread in the laboratory frame of ∆E = p0∆p
beam energy of E0 = 4.2 keV.

The values of Lb and ∆p now deﬁne the phase space density of the bunch and,

consequently, that region, from which ions can be captured into the bunch.

In the above equation (61) the second term in the square root can be neglected
against the ﬁrst by six orders of magnitude with the experimental parameters. We see
then, that ∆p, and consequently ∆E, scales with the square root of the time delay:

5. Identifying the empirical criteria

In [7] three empirical criteria were given by Pedersen et al for synchronization to occur.
We now show how these criteria are connected to what we learned from our mapping

Synchronization in the ”Zajfman trap” II

19

approach, about how and when synchronization occurs and about the bunch’s size
and behavior.

(i) The ﬁrst criterion is the so called ”kinematical criterion”, which in [7] is given
as ∂T
∂E > 0. This criterion obviously is the same as our requirement of α < 1, see (25).
It is related to the special dispersion relation of the trap, in which the faster ion has
a longer period.

(ii) The second criterion, the ”focussing criterion”, states that the interaction of
the ions is important only in the mirror regions and that the bunch diameter has to
be compressed to about the same size as its length. We showed in part I [6] that
collisions in the central part are far more unlikely than collisions in the mirror and
that only collisions in the mirror stably synchronize the ions. We met the requirement
of comparable longitudinal and transverse dimensions when we estimated the bunch
length in sections 3 and 4: a spherical bunch is most eﬃcient in delaying the ions and,
therefore, most stable against external perturbations. With this result, i.e., A = d,
and the projection (32) onto Lb we then derived an estimate (58) for the observed
bunch length, which reproduces the prediction of Pedersen et al (see equation(29) of
reference [7]).

(iii) The third criterion of [7], the ”collision criterion”, states “[. . . ]

that the
collision probability at the turning point must ensure that the ions indeed lock their
motion [. . . ]” and “[. . . ] to few collisions and to many lead to diﬀusion [. . . ]”. For
our formulation the number of collisions has to be substituted by the magnitude of
the time delay — each ion experiences one “collision” when the bunch turns around in
the mirror. The corresponding condition in our approach is the positive eﬀective time
∆Ti
4 > 0 (see equation (29)). As discussed above the delay due to
delay: τ ′m = τm −
the collisions has to be bigger than the intrinsic dispersion ∆Ti/4 for synchronization
to survive this perturbation. We want to emphasize again that the time spread ∆Tv
due to the ions’ diﬀerent energies is not a perturbation but a part of the ion dynamics.
The magnitude of the delay depends on the strength of the interaction, which in turn
depends on the focussing at the turning points in the mirror, i.e., the “hardness” of
the collisions. So the beam diameter may not be wider than a certain maximal value
∆Ti is positive for all relevant initial conditions. This maximal
to ensure that 4τm −
d, corresponding to the minimal “collision probability”, scales with a minimal N
according to equation (57).

The other upper limit was illustrated in ﬁgure 6: if the bunch contains too many
ions or is focussed to tightly the ions bounce oﬀ the bunch potential, experience a
negative delay and diﬀuse out of the bunch.

6. Summary and conclusions

In this paper we extended a recently proposed description of the bunching eﬀect in the
Zajfman trap [6]: the motion of two identical ions in their CM system is described by
three mappings for the diﬀerent parts of the trap. When the ions cross their paths in
the mirror their repulsive interaction slows them down temporarily and the resulting
time delay is responsible for coupling their motion. Here we generalize this two ion
approach to describe the motion of a (representative) test ion in the macroscopic
bunch. The same stability conditions apply as in the two ion case. The size and form
of the bunch are now speciﬁed and a relation between the observed bunch length in
the central part of the trap and its size at the turning point in the mirror is derived,
allowing to explicitly calculate the time delay.

We show that the time delay is maximal for a bunch, which is spherical at the
turning point and how the observed bunch length is derived from this most stable
conﬁguration in dependence on the various parameters.

Our prediction of the observed bunch length does not only match the experimental
results within the level of approximation of our model, but we also conﬁrm that the
bunch length is essentially independent of the number of ions. The lower and the
upper limits on this number are identiﬁed: the lower limit is connected to the spatial
dispersion of the trap, as the time delay that the ions experience when they cross the
bunch has to be big enough to compensate for it. At the upper limit the repulsive
bunch potential becomes too high and the ions can not cross the bunch any more.
Then the ions bounce back from the bunch, the resulting time delay changes its sign,
the ions do not synchronize any more and consequently the bunch looses ions.

The numerical evaluation of the time delay at various parameters illustrates the
behavior of the bunch and conﬁrms the validity of the subsequent approximations
employed in of our description. Experimental data to compare all our results to are
still sparse.

Finally we identify the empirical conditions for synchronization given by Pedersen

et al in the framework of our model.

In this paper we only considered a static bunch, i.e., the bunch exists initially and
is either stable or not. Future work therefore has to focus on the dynamical properties
of the bunching eﬀect, as, e.g., how and at which rate the bunch acquires additional
ions from which parts of phase space. Other open questions include the description of
ions of diﬀerent masses: what is the mass resolution of a Zajfman trap operated as a
mass spectrometer, do bunches of diﬀerent ions “stick together” or can one have more
than one bunch in the trap independently?

Another set of questions is connected with the bunch’s internal dynamics and if
there is an application for this “inner trap” moving through the outer macroscopic
trap.

It is not clear at the moment, if our simple model can be used to answer these
questions or if a more detailed description of the many ion dynamics has to be
used. Nevertheless, our simple model can explain the underlaying mechanism and
the stability criteria and provide insight into how the macroscopic bunch reacts to the
externally given conditions and parameters.

We thank Daniel Strasser and Daniel Zajfman for constructive discussions and further

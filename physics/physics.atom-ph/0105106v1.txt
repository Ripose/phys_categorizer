Scattering and reaction cross sections of e± − P s system are calculated for total angular momentum
L = 0, 1 and 2 and energies between the P s(n = 2) − P s(n = 3) threshold. We solved a set of
Faddeev-Merkuriev and Lippmann-Schwinger integral equations by applying the Coulomb-Sturmian
separable expansion technique. We found that the excited positronium states play dominating roles
in scattering processes.

PACS number(s): 31.15.-p, 34.10.+x, 34.85.+x, 21.45.+v, 03.65.Nk, 02.30.Rz, 02.60.Nm

The e± − P s system plays a very important role in
studying the antimatter. While, on the experimental
side, new experiments, that involve the positronium in
one way or another, are being carried out or planned
[1], on the theoretical side, the existing calculations are
restricted for low energy elastic scattering below the
P s(n = 2) threshold (see Ref. [2] and references therein).
Recently, based on a three-potential picture, we have
developed a new method for treating three-body Coulom-
bic systems [3]. The three-potential formalism results in
a set of Faddeev-Merkuriev and Lippmann-Schwinger in-
tegral equations. These integral equations were solved by
the Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion technique.

In this paper we present scattering and reaction calcu-
lations for energies between the P s(n = 2) − P s(n =
3) threshold and for total angular momentum L =
0, 1, and 2. First we outline the method of Ref. [3] to
the e± − P s system and then present the results.

In the e± − P s system two particles are always identi-
cal. Let us denote them by 1 and 2, and the non-identical
one by 3. The Hamiltonian is given by

H = H 0 + vC

1 + vC

2 + vC
3 ,

(1)

where H 0 is the three-body kinetic energy operator and
vC
α denotes the Coulomb interaction in the subsystem α.
We use the usual conﬁguration-space Jacobi coordinates
xα and yα; xα is the coordinate between the pair (β, γ)
and yα is the coordinate between the particle α and the
center of mass of the pair (β, γ). Thus the potential vC
α ,
the interaction of the pair (β, γ), appears as vC
α (xα). We
also use the notation X = {xα, yα} ∈ R6.

The Hamiltonian (1) is deﬁned in the three-body
Hilbert space. So, the two-body potential operators are
formally embedded in the three-body Hilbert space,

vC = vC (x)1y,

(2)

where 1y is a unit operator in the two-body Hilbert
space associated with the y coordinate. The role of a
Coulomb potential in a three-body Coulombic system
is twofold.
In one hand, it acts like a long-range po-
tential since it modiﬁes the asymptotic motion. On the

other hand, however, it acts like a short-range potential,
since it correlates strongly the particles and may support
bound states. Merkuriev introduced a separation of the
three-body conﬁguration space into diﬀerent asymptotic
regions [4]. The two-body asymptotic region Ω is deﬁned
as a part of the three-body conﬁguration space where the
conditions

|x| < x0(1 + |y|/y0)1/ν ,

(3)

with x0, y0 > 0 and ν > 2, are satisﬁed. Merkuriev
proposed to split the Coulomb interaction in the three-
body conﬁguration space into short-range and long-range
terms

vC = v(s) + v(l),

where the superscripts s and l indicate the short- and
long-range attributes, respectively. The splitting is car-
ried out with the help of a splitting function ζ,

v(s)(x, y) = vC (x)ζ(x, y),
v(l)(x, y) = vC (x)[1 − ζ(x, y)].

The function ζ is deﬁned such that

ζ(x, y) X→∞
−−−−→

1, X ∈ Ω
0 otherwise.

(cid:26)

In practice usually the functional form

ζ(x, y) = 2/

1 + exp

(x/x0)ν /(1 + y/y0)
(cid:2)

(cid:3)(cid:9)

,

(cid:8)

is used.

In the Hamiltonian (1) the potential vC

3 , acting be-
tween the identical particles, is a repulsive Coulomb po-
tential which does not support bound states. Conse-
quently, the entire vC
3 can be considered as long-range
potential. Then, the long-range Hamiltonian is deﬁned
as

H (l) = H 0 + v(l)

1 + v(l)

2 + vC
3 ,

and the three-body Hamiltonian takes the form

summation implicitly included)

H = H (l) + v(s)

1 + v(s)
2 .

(10)

So, the Hamiltonian of the e± − P s system appears for-
mally as a three-body Hamiltonian with two short-range
potentials. The Faddeev procedure is applicable, and,
in this case, we get a set of two-component Faddeev-
Merkuriev integral equations

We make the following approximation on the integral

where |φ(l)
tor, respectively, of the channel Coulomb Hamiltonian

α are eigenstate and resolvent opera-

α i and G(l)

H (l)

α = H (l) + v(s)
α .

Since the particles 1 and 2 are identical the Faddeev
components |ψ1i and |ψ2i, in their own natural Jacobi
coordinates, have the same functional forms

hx1y1|ψ1i = hx2y2|ψ2i = hxy|ψi.

(14)

Therefore we can determine |ψi from the ﬁrst equation
only

|ψi = |Φ(l)

1 i + G(l)

1 v(s)

1 pP|ψi,

(15)

where P is the operator for the permutation of indexes
1 and 2 and p = ±1 are eigenvalues of P. We note that
although this integral equation has only one component
yet gives full account on the asymptotic and symmetry
properties of the system.

We solve this integral equation by using the Coulomb–
Sturmian separable expansion approach. The Coulomb-
Sturmian (CS) functions are deﬁned by

alytically. The contour C should encircle, in positive di-
rection, the spectrum of hy1 without penetrating into the
spectrum of hx1. Further details on the contour and on
those CS matrix elements are given in Ref. [3] and refer-
ences therein.

where i and f refer to the initial and the ﬁnal states,
respectively. Having the solutions ψ and Φ(l) the matrix
elements can easily be evaluated.

In the numerical calculations we used atomic units.
For the parameters of the splitting function (8) we took
x0 = 10, y0 = 20 and ν = 2.1, respectively, and for the
size parameter of the CS basis we used b = 0.2. In the
expansion of the potentials we went up to 11 angular mo-
mentum channels and, in each angular momentum chan-
nels, up to N = 27 CS functions. This way we achieved
convergence up to 2 − 3% and also the K-matrix were
symmetric with a similar accuracy. Some of the results
were cross-checked by the results of conﬁguration-space
diﬀerential equation calculation [5], and we found again
very good agreements.

The results for total angular momentum L = 0, L = 1
and L = 2 are given in Tables I, II and III, respec-
tively. We can see that the excited positronium states
play dominating roles in scattering processes, especially
when the total energies approach the positronium exci-
tation threshold (from above). This behavior is consis-
tent with the rather large size of the excited positron-
ium targets, where the long-range polarization potential
play dominant roles. This behavior is similar to the phe-
nomena found in ¯p − Ps multichannel scattering process,
where this mechanism dominates the antihydrogen for-
mation cross section (will be published in a separate pa-
per).

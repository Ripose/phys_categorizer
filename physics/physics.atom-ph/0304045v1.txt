Abstract

The recent observation of coherent backscattering (CBS) of light by atoms has em-
phasized the key role of the velocity spread and of the quantum internal structure of
the atoms. Firstly, using highly resonant scatterers imposes very low temperatures
of the disordered medium in order to keep the full contrast of the CBS interference.
This criterion is usually achieved with standard laser cooling techniques. Secondly,
a non trivial internal atomic structure leads to a dramatic decrease of the CBS con-
trast. Experiments with Rubidium atoms (with a non trivial internal structure) and
with Strontium (with the simplest possible internal structure) show this behaviour
and conﬁrm theoretical calculations.

Key words: Multiple scattering, Atom, Cooling

After a few scattering mean free path ℓ, a wave (with wavenumber k = 2π/λ)
propagating in an opaque medium rapidly looses the memory of its initial
direction. At this scale, intensity propagation is often described as a diﬀusion
process. However this description discards an important phenomenon: inter-
ference between multiply scattered waves. It is now known that interference
alters the wave transport and can, under suitable conditions, bring it to a
complete stop. This is the Anderson (or strong) localization regime, where
the diﬀusion is suppressed [1]. For twenty years, there have been tremendous
experimental as well as theoretical eﬀorts to study interference eﬀects in the
multiple scattering regime [2].
A hallmark in this ﬁeld is the CBS cone which is observed as a reﬂection

1/kℓ at backscattering. It corresponds to the in-
peak with angular width
coherent sum of two-waves interference between a possible multiple scattering
path amplitude and its reversed counterpart [3]. This interferential increase of
the conﬁguration-averaged diﬀuse reﬂection oﬀ a disordered sample depends
on the nature of the scatterer but also, for vectorial waves like light, on the
input/output polarization channel. For classical spherically-symmetric scatter-
ers, the maximum enhancement factor of the CBS cone is 2 in the h
h helicity-
k
preserving polarization channel, independently of the geometrical shape of the
scattering medium [4]. This is so for two reasons. First, in the h
h channel
k
single scattering is suppressed : for spherically-symmetric scatterers, the polar-
ization is conserved at backscattering, like in specular reﬂection oﬀ a mirror.
Second, in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, the amplitudes of the interfering
paths are exactly equal at backscattering by virtue of the reciprocity theorem
[5].
We will see that the observation of a CBS cone with a maximum contrast on
a resonant atomic gas, however imposes severe restrictions on the external as
well as internal degrees of freedom of the atoms. In section 1 we review some
eﬀects related to moving resonant scatterers. In section 2 we show how the
internal structure of the atomic scatterer reduces the CBS contrast. In section
3 experimental results, obtained in the weak localization regime kℓ
1, are
presented. They conﬁrm theoretical predictions about the role of the internal
structure.

1 CBS with resonant scatterers

1.1 Dynamical breakdown of CBS enhancement factor: Double scattering

model

When the scattering medium is made of moving particles, and this is the case in
an atomic cloud, the amplitudes of the direct and reverse scattering sequences
are no more linked by reciprocity and one observes a dynamical breakdown
of the CBS eﬀect [6]. This reduction of the CBS enhancement factor depends
on the velocity distribution of the particles and we can assert very generally
that the interference contrast will not be much aﬀected provided the velocity
spread will not be too large. For moving resonant scatterers, we will see that
“not too large” imposes a stringent condition which will require laser cooling
techniques to be fulﬁlled.
As a simplistic starting model, we neglect light polarization eﬀects (scalar wave
approximation) and describe atoms as highly resonant isotropic scatterers. The
atomic resonance is characterized by a transition frequency ω0 in the optical
domain and a transition width Γ (typically ω0
108). The scatterers are then

sequences: ﬁrst the atomic response at each scattering has to be evaluated
kv which is randomly Doppler-shifted. This means that
at a frequency ω
each scattering has a variable strength and that the wave experiences a ran-
dom phase-kick. Furthermore, after scattering is completed, the wave has a
frequency ω′ = ω

eﬀective medium (until the following scattering) occurs with an optical in-
dex evaluated at random frequency. As an overall conclusion, there will be
a random strength imbalance and a random dephasing between direct and
reverse scattering sequences, leading to a reduction of the CBS interference.
Let us illustrate this dynamical breakdown for a peculiar double scattering
path (see ﬁgure 1). We consider an incoming resonant light wave (frequency
ω = ω0, wave-vector ki) and, to simplify the discussion, we only consider the
eﬀect of dephasing between the paths. The total phase shift at backscattering

1.2 Atoms cooling and trapping

In a MOT, due to the combined action of the Zeeman and Doppler eﬀects,
a restoring force spatially traps the atoms at the zero of the magnetic ﬁeld
gradient and cools them in velocity space (for a review on cooling see e.g.
W. Phillips [7]). The cooling action is based on a Doppler-induced diﬀerential
radiation pressure force between contra-propagating laser beams. For a two-
level system in the low saturation limit and at low velocities (kv
Γ), the
average force is a pure friction force if the laser is red-detuned with respect to
the transition (ω < ω0) . At steady state, this cooling mechanism is balanced
by the heating mechanism induced by the random character of photon absorp-
tion and emission processes. The equilibrium state is then characterized by a
Gaussian velocity distribution with rms value:

where the recoil velocity vr = ¯hk
m is the velocity change during a single ab-
sorption or emission event. For the usual dipole-allowed transitions, the recoil
frequency shift is small with respect to the width of the transition

Thus equation 4 is well fulﬁlled in a MOT and the dynamical breakdown
of the CBS eﬀect should be negligible in most cases (see for example Table

1). Moreover, when Fg > 0, extra cooling mechanics, the so-called Sisyphus
cooling [8], lower the ﬁnal rms velocity with respect to relation (5).

For Rb, the MOT is loaded in a cell from a low-pressure thermal vapour and
for Sr from an eﬀusive atomic beam. The total number of trapped atoms is
determined by a balance between trapping and loss mechanisms (e.g. atom-
atom collisions). It usually ranges from 107 to 1010 atoms in standard operating
conditions. However for localization experiments, it is crucial to achieve an
optical depth at least larger than unity to reach the multiple scattering regime.
This requirement is usually satisﬁed in a MOT using a resonant probe beam. It
can be also interesting to achieve a high spatial density for strong localization
experiments where kℓ
1 is demanded. Unfortunately, in most cases, multiple
scattering is the dominant limiting factor [9] and spatial densities in a MOT
are generally limited to a few of 1010atoms/cm3 implying kℓ

2 Reduction of the CBS cone due to internal structure

In section 1.1, we saw how the velocity distribution of atoms can alter the CBS
contrast. Another important suppression mechanism of the CBS interference
eﬀects has been pointed out in reference [10]. It is related to the internal de-
grees freedom of the scatterers. In fact, the optical dipole transition connects
two Zeeman-degenerate multiplets (in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld). The
groundstate (resp. excited) multiplet has a total angular momentum Fg (resp.
Fe) and contains 2Fg + 1 (resp. 2Fe + 1) magnetic levels. To fully describe scat-
tering, one needs to specify the initial and ﬁnal groundstate levels. Two types
of transitions can occur : those leaving the internal state unaﬀected (Rayleigh
transitions) and those changing the internal state (Raman transitions). Thus,
when calculating the CBS cone one has to take properly into account all those
allowed mechanisms. Note that since all levels in a given multiplet have same
energies, light scattering is always elastic. However scattering is no more de-
scribed by the atomic polarizability alone and one now needs the full scattering
tensor. In other words, non scalar features of scattering will become essential.
It can be shown that the internal structure has two major consequences. First,
because Raman transitions are unavoidable and since they are accompanied

by a change of light polarization at backscattering (see Figure 2b), the single
scattering contribution is no more suppressed in the h
h channel. This leads
k
to a rather trivial CBS contrast reduction since the same would occur with
classical non-spherically symmetric scatterers. Second, and this point is more
subtle, the interfering amplitudes are no more linked in general by reciprocity.
This is because under time-reversal the angular momentum of atoms has to
be ﬂipped. This leads to unbalanced amplitudes for the direct and reverse
scattering sequences and to a decrease of the CBS contrast as soon as Fg > 0
[11,12]. In the h
h channel, it can be shown that this contrast reduction can be
k
attributed to the antisymmetric part of the scattering tensor [11]. For Fg = 0
(absence of internal structure in the groundstate), one recovers the previous
classical result. Figure 3 shows the CBS cone for the four usual polarization
channels and for two diﬀerent transitions in a semi-inﬁnite medium. For the
Fe = 1 transition, cones shape and height are the same than for
Fg = 0
a classical dipole-like scatterer. For the Fg = 3
Fe = 4 transition, the
enhancement factor is systematically lower for all polarization channels.

3 Experimental results

≪

The detailed experimental procedure for the CBS observation has been pub-
lished elsewhere [13]. Brieﬂy, the signal is obtained using a collimated resonant
1cm). To avoid
probe with a beam waist bigger than the size of the cloud (
any eﬀects linked to the saturation of the optical transition (non-linearities,
inelastic radiation spectrum) [14], the probe intensity is weak (saturation pa-
rameter s
1). The scattered light is collected in the backward direction by
placing a CCD camera in the focal plane of an achromatic doublet. The CBS
cone plots shown in ﬁgure 4 are obtained in the h
h polarization. As predicted,
k
the enhancement factor is strongly reduced for the Rb transition. However a
quantitative comparison with theory calls for some care since the calculation
assumes an homogeneous semi-inﬁnite medium whereas the Rb experiment is
made on a ﬁnite sample of Gaussian-distributed atoms. In this type of geome-
try, it is clear that the weight of long scattering paths are overestimated with
respect to the ﬁnite size sample case. Besides, theoretical calculations show
that the major contribution of the CBS cone comes from low scattering orders.
Thus, considering only the single and double scattering events, the enhance-
ment factor is predicted to be α(2)
th = 1.17 [10]. The experimental value thus
interpolates nicely these two extreme predictions. For the Sr experiment, the
enhancement factor is found to be α = 1.86 , slightly lower the theoretical pre-
diction α = 2. Several experimental issues can explain the diﬀerence; the ﬁnite
angular resolution of the detection apparatus and the imperfect polarization
channel isolation [15]. In ﬁgure 5, the experimental Sr CBS cone is compared
to a Monte-Carlo simulation [15]. The agreement is clearly excellent.

4 Conclusion

To summarize, we have shown that the internal structure and the velocity
distribution of resonant scatterers like atoms have a deep impact on the CBS
eﬀect. The dynamical breakdown induced by the motion of the scatterers can
be made negligible at the expense of using laser-cooled atoms. Unfortunately,
the internal structure irrevocably leads to very small enhancement factors in
all polarization channels as soon as the atomic groundstate is degenerate. This
has been evidenced by experiments on Rubidium. Restoration of a full inter-
ference contrast is obtained with non degenerate atoms like in the Strontium
experiment. This should have interesting potentialities for wave localization
experiments with cold atoms. For example, in the quest for Anderson local-
ization (which could be obtained only at high density where kl
1) where
interferences play a crucial role, a Fg = 0
Fe = 1 transition appears to be
a good choice. Is it now possible to increase the cloud density to reach the
Anderson localization threshold? For this purpose, cooling strontium with the

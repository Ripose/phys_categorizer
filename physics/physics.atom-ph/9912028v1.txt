Abstract

Parity (P ) and time (T ) invariance violating eﬀects in the Ra atom are
strongly enhanced due to close states of opposite parity, the large nuclear
charge Z and the collective nature of P, T -odd nuclear moments. We have
performed calculations of the atomic electric dipole moments (EDM) pro-
duced by the electron EDM and the nuclear magnetic quadrupole and Schiﬀ
moments. We have also calculated the eﬀects of parity non-conservation pro-
duced by the nuclear anapole moment and the weak charge. Our results show
that as a rule the values of these eﬀects are much larger than those considered
so far in other atoms (enhancement is up to 105 times).

The lower energy levels of radium corresponding to conﬁgurations of diﬀerent parity have
very close energies. This leads to a strong enhancement of the various parity (P ) and time
(T ) invariance violating eﬀects. In our previous paper [1] we considered the states 7s6d 3D2
1, which are separated by
1 and 7s7p 3P1 with E = 13999.38cm−
with E = 13993.97cm−
3 eV). Simple estimates showed that the eﬀects
a very small interval of
of nuclear P - and T -odd moments such as the magnetic quadrupole moment (MQM), the
Schiﬀ moment (SM) and the anapole moment (AM) are many times larger than in all atomic
systems considered before. In the present paper we present more accurate calculations of
these and other parity and time invariance non-conserving eﬀects in those states of the
radium atom where the eﬀects are large. We use a relatively simple ab initio approximation
to perform the calculations. The approximation is a reasonable compromise between the
simplicity of the calculations and the accuracy of the results.
It is based on relativistic
Hartree-Fock (RHF) and conﬁguration interaction (CI) methods. A minimum number of
basis states are used at the CI stage of the calculations. However, important many-body
eﬀects, such as polarization of the atomic core by an external ﬁeld and correlations between
core and valence electrons, are included in the calculations of single-electron matrix elements.
To control the accuracy of the calculations we also calculated hyperﬁne structure intervals
and lifetimes of lower states of radium and its lighter analog barium.

Our calculations conﬁrm the estimates done in the previous work [1] and show that the
value of most P - and T -odd eﬀects in radium is much higher than in other atoms considered
before. The parity non-conserving (PNC) electric dipole transition amplitude between the
9(QW /N)iea0, which is 100 times
ground and 3D1 even states is about E1P N C ≈
larger than the measured PNC amplitude in cesium [2] and about 5 times larger than the
corresponding amplitude in francium [3]. The enhancement of the electron electric dipole
moment (EDM) in the 3D1 state of Ra is about 5400, which is again many times larger than
corresponding values for the ground states of Fr (910) and Au (260) [4]. The transition
amplitude between the ground and 3D2 even states induced by the nuclear anapole moment

is about 10−
Also, the EDM of the Ra atom in the 3D2 state induced by the nuclear Schiﬀ and magnetic
quadrupole moments is strongly enhanced. Both contributions (SM and MQM) are about
cm (η is the dimensionless constant of the P -,T -odd nucleon-nucleon interaction).
10−
This is again about 105 times larger than the EDM of the Hg atom which currently gives the
best limit on η [5]. All this makes radium a very promising candidate for the experimental
study of P - and T -odd forces by means of atomic physics.

We use relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) and conﬁguration interaction (CI) methods to
construct two-electron wave functions of the ground and lower excited states of barium and
radium. The calculations start from the RHF method for a closed shell system corresponding
to the ground state conﬁguration (6s2 for Ba and 7s2 for Ra). Since nsnp and ns(n
1)d
conﬁgurations, with n = 6 for Ba and n = 7 for Ra, do not correspond to a closed-shell
system, we calculate p and d basis states in a model HF potential. For example, to calculate

for the CI calculations (ns1/2, np1/2, np3/2, (n
−
that this simple CI approximation signiﬁcantly overestimates the relative value of spin-orbit
intervals for the odd-parity states and underestimates it for the even-parity states. This
aﬀects the accuracy of the calculation of P - and T -odd eﬀects because most of them involve
transitions with a change of spin which are sensitive to the value of the relativistic eﬀects. We
found that the spin-orbit intervals are sensitive to the screening of the Coulomb interaction
between two external electrons (recall that Coulomb integrals contribute to the spin-orbit
splitting due to the diﬀerence between the single-particle radial wave functions belonging
to diﬀerent components of the single-particle doublets). To improve the quality of the wave
functions we introduce ﬁtting factors fk to the Coulomb interaction in the CI calculations (k
is the multipolarity of the Coulomb interaction). It was found that multiplying all Coulomb
integrals of multipolarities 0, 1 and 2 by factors f0 = 0.7, f1 = 0.75, f2 = 0.9 signiﬁcantly
improves the energies and ﬁne structure intervals of lower odd and even states of barium
and radium. These factors simulate the eﬀect of the screening of the Coulomb interaction
between valence electrons and core electrons. They also compensate to some extent the
eﬀect of the incompleteness of the basis set.

To calculate values other than energy, such as the eﬀect of electron interaction with
photons and nuclear P - and T -odd ﬁelds, we also include core polarization eﬀects (direct
and exchange RPA-type corrections) and core-valence correlation eﬀects (the Bruckner-type
correlation corrections). These two eﬀects are very important for the considered states of
radium. Indeed, consider mixture of the 3DJ and 3PJ ′ states by the P - and T -odd interac-
tion W . Corresponding dominant conﬁgurations (7s6d and 7s7p) can only be mixed by a
7p
matrix element. However, this matrix element is extremely small in the Hartree-
h
Fock approximation. This is because the electron interaction with P - and T -odd nuclear
moments is localized in the vicinity of the nucleus where the d-electron does not penetrate
due to the centrifugal barrier. On the other hand, the polarization of the electron core by
these moments produces a long-range correction δV to the HF potential which eﬀectively
renormalizes the interaction of an external electron with the nucleus. The corresponding
d transition due

elements also contribute to the mixture of the 3DJ and 3PJ ′ states due to the conﬁguration

The p

more important and as we see from our calculations there are cases when s

they increase the density of an external electron on the nucleus by

30% (see e.g. [6]).

The full scale inclusion of the core polarization and correlation eﬀects into the CI cal-
culations (see, e.g. [7]) lies beyond the framework of this research. We adopted a simpliﬁed
approach in which the corresponding corrections are calculated for the single-particle matrix

larization and core-valence correlations have been extrapolated from accurate calculations
of the core polarization and Bruckner-type correlation corrections for the radium positive
ion. Ra+ has a simple electronic structure - one electron above closed shells - and the
corresponding procedures are well deﬁned for it [8].

To check our method and the accuracy of our results, we calculated the hyperﬁne struc-
ture (hfs) constants of 213Ra and 137Ba. The results for the energies and hfs constants are
presented in Table I. One can see that even for this very simple CI approximation the
accuracy of the energies and ﬁne structure intervals is very good. The accuracy of the hfs
constants is also good for the most important states 3D2 and 3P1. Table II shows the eﬀect
of the core polarization (RPA) and Bruckner-type correlations (Σ) on the single-electron

Apart from the enhancement, there are several suppression factors in (1). First, the electric
dipole matrix element is small because of a change of spin. It is 3 to 5 times smaller than
most of those amplitudes which do not change atomic spin (see Table III). Second, in the

This is one hundred times larger than the measured PNC amplitude in cesium [2] and about
5 times larger than the corresponding amplitude in francium [3]. Even radium isotopes have
close values of the amplitudes (approximately, the eﬀect is proportional to the number of
neutrons N).

B. Anapole moment

The Hamiltonian of the electron interaction with the nuclear anapole moment is presented
in the appendix (A9). Similar to the spin-independent PNC interaction, it mixes states of
opposite parity and leads to non-zero E1-transition amplitudes between states of initially
equal parity. However, it can also mix states with ∆J = 1 and it depends on the nuclear spin,
so that its contribution to transitions between diﬀerent hyperﬁne structure components are
diﬀerent. The corresponding expression is very similar to (1). However, dependence on the
hyperﬁne structure must be included (see formula (A12) in the appendix for details). This
3D2i
amplitude is proportional to the
matrix element. Contributions of diﬀerent
single-electron transitions into this matrix element are presented in Table IV. Note the
strong cancellation between terms corresponding to s
d transitions. This means
that an accurate inclusion of the core polarization and core-valence correlation eﬀects is very
important indeed, as has been discussed above. We believe that the ﬁtting of the energies
helps to stabilize this matrix element similar to the case of the E1-transition amplitude.

3D2 transitions are presented in Table V. Note that
the contribution of the anapole moment to the PNC amplitude (3) can be measured by
comparing the amplitudes between diﬀerent hyperﬁne structure components similar to what
was done for cesium [2]. However, it may be much more eﬃcient to measure the eﬀect of the
3D2 transition because it is about ten times larger due to the
anapole moment in the 1S0−
small energy denominator and because the nuclear spin independent PNC interaction does
not contribute to this amplitude at all due to the large change of the total electron angular
momentum ∆J = 2.

IV. ATOMIC ELECTRIC DIPOLE MOMENTS

A. Electron EDM

An electron electric dipole moment interacting with an atomic ﬁeld mixes states with
the same total momentum J and opposite parity. As a result, an atomic EDM appears. The
EDM of radium in the 3D1 state is strongly enhanced due to the closeness of the opposite
parity state 3P1. In an approximation when only the mixture of the closest states is included,
the EDM is given by

To plan experimental measurements of space and time invariance violation in radium it
is important to know the lifetimes of the states of interest. Apart from that, comparison of
the calculated and experimental lifetimes can serve as a good test of the method used for
calculation of P - and T - invariance violation since the same dipole transition amplitudes

contribute in either case. As far as we know, none of the radium lifetimes have been measured
so far. On the other hand, some experimental data is available for barium. Therefore, we
calculated lifetimes of lower states of both atoms. Results for dipole transition amplitudes
are presented in Table III and the corresponding lifetimes are in Table VIII.

For the purpose of the present work, the most important states of radium are 3P1,3D1 and
3D2 states. The decay rate of the 3P1 state is strongly dominated by the 3P1 - 1S0 transition.
Transitions to the 3D1 and 3D2 states are suppressed due to small frequencies. The 3P1 - 1S0
dipole transition amplitude involves a change of the atomic spin and therefore is sensitive
to the value of the relativistic eﬀects. This makes the amplitude numerically unstable.
This probably explains the poor agreement between diﬀerent calculations (see Table VIII).
However, we believe that the ﬁtting of the ﬁne structure which we have done for Ba and
Ra (see Section II) brings the amplitude close to the correct value. This is supported by
similar calculations for barium. The 3P1 - 1S0 amplitude contributes 38% to the decay rate
of the 3P1 state of barium. Good agreement between calculated and experimental lifetimes
of this state (see Table VIII) means that all transition amplitudes, including the 3P1 - 1S0
amplitude, are calculated quite accurately.

The lifetime of the 3D1 state of Ra is determined by the 3D1 - 3P0 transition which is
numerically stable. The lifetime of this state calculated by us is in good agreement with the
estimations done by Budker and DeMille [9].

The 3D2 state of radium is a metastable state. It decays only via electric quadrupole
(E2) transition to the ground state. Calculations similar to the electric dipole transitions
show that the lifetime of this state in the absence of external ﬁelds is about 15 seconds.
However, measurements of the atomic EDM involve placing the atoms in a strong electric
ﬁeld. It is important to know how the lifetimes of the 3D2 and 3D1 states of Ra are aﬀected
by this ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld mixes states of diﬀerent parity and ∆J = 0,
1. If only an
admixture of the nearest state is taken into account, the amplitude which determines the
decay rate of a 3DJ state is given by

For an electric ﬁeld of 10 kV/cm, the lifetime of the 3D2 state is 30 µs, while the lifetime
of the 3D1 state is 240 ms. This latter result is in good agreement with estimations done
by Budker and DeMille [9]. Note that the state 3D2, with maximum or minimal possible
projection of the total momentum on the direction of the electric ﬁeld (M =
2), cannot
be mixed by this ﬁeld with the 3P1 state. Therefore its lifetime is much less aﬀected.

The radium atom turns out to be a very promising candidate for the study of time

enhanced due to the high value of the nuclear charge Z and the closeness of the opposite
parity states of the atom. Moreover, the contribution of diﬀerent mechanisms to the time and
space invariance violating eﬀects can be studied separately if measurements are performed
for diﬀerent states and diﬀerent isotopes of the radium atom. For example, the atomic EDM
induced by the electron EDM is strongly enhanced in the 3D1 state, while contributions of
the nuclear Schiﬀ and magnetic quadrupole moments are strongly enhanced in the 3D2 state.
On the other hand, the magnetic quadrupole moment is zero for isotopes with nuclear spin
I = 1/2, like 225Ra, while the Schiﬀ moment for these isotopes is not zero.

Calculations of the space and time invariance violating eﬀects in radium reveal the im-
portance of relativistic and many-body eﬀects. The accuracy achieved in the present work
is probably 20-30 %. However, a further improvement in accuracy is possible if such a need
arises from the progress in measurements.

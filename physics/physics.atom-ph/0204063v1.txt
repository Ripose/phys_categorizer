Abstract

We use a diode laser locked to a Rb transition as the frequency reference along

with a scanning Michelson interferometer to make precise measurements on

the D1 and D2 lines of potassium. The Rb reference frequency is known with

sub-MHz accuracy. We obtain the following values for the energy levels: 12

985.169 60(13)(15) cm−1 for the 4P1/2 state (D1 line); 13 042.875 95(14)(15)
cm−1 for the 4P3/2 state (D2 line); and 57.706 35(19)(15) cm−1 for the 4P3/2 −

4P1/2 ﬁne-structure interval. The leading source of systematic error cancels

in the determination of the interval. The errors represent about an order of

magnitude improvement over tabulated values.

Semiconductor diode lasers bring several advantages to the ﬁeld of laser spectroscopy,

the principal ones being tunability and narrow spectral width [1]. By placing a single-mode

diode in an external cavity and using optical feedback from an angle-tuned grating [2], it can

be made to operate at single frequency (single longitudinal mode) with linewidth of order 1

MHz and tunability over several nm. In addition, techniques such as saturated-absorption

spectroscopy using counter-propagating pump and probe beams can help eliminate the ﬁrst-

order Doppler eﬀect and allow narrow hyperﬁne transitions within a given atomic line to be

resolved. It is thus possible to get an absolute frequency calibration of the laser by locking to

such a transition. Recently, we have shown that a diode laser locked to an atomic transition

in Rb can be used along with a scanning Michelson interferometer as a precision wavemeter

to determine the unknown frequency of a tunable laser [3].

In this Letter, we apply this technique to determine the absolute frequencies of the D lines

in potassium. The frequency of the reference laser is known with sub-MHz accuracy, and

the unknown laser is tuned to the one of the D-line transitions in K with ∼MHz accuracy,

therefore the frequencies are also determined with ∼MHz accuracy. More importantly, we

can determine the ﬁne-structure interval in the 4P state with this accuracy. Knowledge of

ﬁne-structure intervals is important for several reasons, e.g. in the study of atomic collisions,

astrophysical processes, and relativistic calculations of atomic energy levels. Alkali atoms

are particularly important because of their widespread use in ultra-cold collision studies,

photoassociation spectroscopy, atomic tests of parity violation, and more recently in Bose-

Einstein condensation [4]. The species we have studied is K in which there has been renewed

interest recently because laser cooling can be used to produce a quantum degenerate Fermi

gas [5]. But the technique is more general and applicable to other alkali atoms such as Li

or Cs, alkali-like ions, and indeed any system where precise knowledge of energy levels is

important. We achieve an accuracy of 0.00015 cm−1, which is one to two orders of magnitude

better than the typical accuracy of the energy-level tables [6].

The interferometer used for the ratio measurement has been described extensively in a

previous publication [3]. For consistency with the terminology there, we will call the two

2

lasers as “reference” and “unknown”, respectively. The basic idea is to obtain the ratio

of the two laser wavelengths using a scanning Michelson interferometer where both lasers

traverse essentially the same path. As the interferometer is scanned, the interference pattern

on the detectors goes alternately through bright and dark fringes. Since both lasers traverse

the same path, the ratio of the number of fringes counted after scanning through a certain

distance is the ratio of the two wavelengths. The ratio obtained is a wavelength ratio in air,

however, the wavelength ratio in vacuum (or equivalent frequency ratio) is easily calculated

by making a small correction for the dispersion of air [7] between the reference wavelength

and the unknown.

The reference laser is a diode laser system built around a commercial single-mode diode.

The output is ﬁrst collimated using an aspheric lens to give an elliptic beam of 5.8 mm ×

1.8 mm 1/e2 diameter. The laser is then frequency stabilized in a standard external-cavity

design (Littrow conﬁguration) using optical feedback from an 1800 lines/mm diﬀraction

grating mounted on a piezoelectric transducer [2]. Using a combination of temperature and

current control, the laser is tuned close to the 780 nm D2 line in atomic Rb. A part of the

output beam is tapped for Doppler-free saturated-absorption spectroscopy in a Rb vapor

cell. The injection current into the laser diode is modulated slightly to obtain an error signal

and the laser is locked to the 5S1/2, F = 2 → 5P3/2, F ′ = (2, 3) crossover resonance. The

frequency of this resonance has been measured previously to be 384 227 981.877(6) MHz [8].

The elliptic beam from the laser is directly fed into the Michelson interferometer. The large

Rayleigh ranges (∼34 m and ∼3 m in the two directions) ensure that the beam remains

collimated over the length of the interferometer and diﬀraction eﬀects are not signiﬁcant.

The relevant energy levels of 39K are shown in Fig. 1. The ground state has two hyperﬁne

levels with F = 1 and 2. The D1 line is the 4S1/2 ↔ 4P1/2 transition at 770.1 nm. The 4P1/2

state again has two hyperﬁne levels with F = 1 and 2. The D2 line is the 4S1/2 ↔ 4P3/2

transition at 767.7 nm. The upper state has 4 excited levels, with F = 0, 1, 2, and 3. The

measurements on the D lines of K are done using a single-frequency tunable Ti-sapphire

laser (Coherent 899-21). The laser can be tuned from 700–800 nm and is frequency stabilized

3

to an ovenized reference cavity that gives it a linewidth of 500 kHz. A part of the output is

split oﬀ for saturated-absorption spectroscopy in a K vapor cell. The cell is heated to about

70oC to get suﬃcient vapor. The saturated-absorption spectra on the D1 and D2 lines for

transitions starting from the F = 2 ground level are also shown in Fig. 1. The two hyperﬁne

transitions in the D1 line are well resolved, as seen in the ﬁgure. This is because the hyperﬁne

interval in the 4P1/2 state is about 60 MHz. On the other hand, all the hyperﬁne levels in

the 4P3/2 lie within a range of 30 MHz, and the individual transitions in the D2 line are
not resolved. However, the peak in the spectrum corresponds to the F = 2 → F ′ = (2, 3)

crossover resonance, and this is what we use for the measurements. For transitions starting

from the F = 1 ground level, the peak corresponds to the F = 1 → F ′ = (1, 2) crossover

resonance.

To get several independent measurements of the energy levels, we tune the Ti-sapphire

laser to diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions of the D1 and D2 lines in K. In each case, the wave-

length ratio is measured about 600 times. The values are statistically analyzed to obtain

the mean ratio and the 1σ (statistical) error in the mean. The mean wavelength ratios

obtained from four such measurements (two for each line) are listed in Table I. We extract

the hyperﬁne-free energy level of the state by making two corrections to the measured ratio.

First, we convert the wavelength ratio in air to a frequency ratio using the refractive index of

air from Edl´en’s formula [7]: n = 1.000 275 163 at 780.0 nm (reference), n = 1.000 275 231

at 770.1 nm (D1), and n = 1.000 275 255 at 767.7 nm (D2). Then we remove the hyperﬁne

frequency shifts shown in Fig. 1, which are known to sub-MHz accuracy [9]. The extracted

values of the energy levels are also listed in Table I.

The main source of statistical error is that the frequency counter counts zero-crossings

and does not count fractional fringes. The total number of fringes counted depends on the

fringe rate (or cart speed) coupled with the 1 s integration time. We use about 20 cm of

cart travel per measurement, which results in a single-shot statistical error of about 5 parts

in 107 in each data set [10]. The error of less than 2 parts in 108 in Table I comes after

averaging over ∼ 600 individual measurements. We also plot a histogram of the individual

4

points to make sure that the distribution around the mean is Gaussian. This guarantees

that there is no signiﬁcant statistical bias in the data.

There are several potential sources of systematic error, the main two being variation in the

lock point of the lasers and non-parallelism of the two laser beams in the interferometer. We

have checked for the ﬁrst error by locking the unknown laser to diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions.

The transitions are about 500 MHz apart and the saturated-absorption spectrum in each

case is quite diﬀerent. Therefore, we expect the deﬁnition of the lock point also to be quite

diﬀerent. However, as seen from Table I, within the errors quoted the diﬀerent ratios yield

consistent values for the hyperﬁne-free energy level. This implies that there is no signiﬁcant

variation in the lock point of the lasers.

The second source of systematic error, namely that the two beams have a small angle

between them, is more serious. Any misalignment would cause a systematic increase in the

measured ratio given by 1/ cos θ, where θ is the angle between the beams. We have tried

to minimize this error in two ways. The ﬁrst method is as follows. When the beams from

the two arms of the interferometer are combined on the beamsplitter, two output beams are

produced. Of these, the one on the opposite side of the beamsplitter from the input beam

has near-perfect contrast and is detected for the measurement. The unused output beam

(the one on the same side of the beamsplitter as the input beam) propagates towards the

other laser, and can therefore be used as a tracer for checking the parallelism of the lasers.

Using this method, we ensure that the reference and unknown beams are parallel over a

distance of about 3 m [11]. The second method to check for parallelism is to look for a

minimum in the measured ratio as the angle of the unknown beam is varied. This works

because the measured value is always larger than the correct value, whether θ is positive or

negative, and becomes minimum when θ = 0. We ﬁnd this method to be more reliable and

it quickly guarantees us that the beams are perfectly aligned.

It is diﬃcult to get a quantitative estimate of the systematic error due to this non-

parallelism. However, it is important to note that the error cancels in the determination of

the ﬁne-structure interval. This is because the measurements on the D1 and D2 lines are

5

done without changing the alignment in the interferometer. The direction of the output of

the Ti-sapphire laser does not change when its wavelength is changed, therefore any mis-

alignment angle remains the same during all the measurements. If there is a misalignment,

the measured frequencies on both the D1 and the D2 lines will be systematically higher

but by the same amount, so that when we take their diﬀerence to obtain the ﬁne-structure

interval, the error will cancel.

As a further check on possible systematic errors in our measured frequencies, we have

repeated the measurement scheme using a diﬀerent reference laser. This set of measurements

was done using a reference diode laser locked to a transition in the D1 line of Rb at 795 nm.

The diode laser system is identical to the ﬁrst one, except that after stabilization it is locked

to the 5S1/2, F = 3 → 5P1/2, F ′ = 3 transition in 85Rb. The frequency of this transition

is 377 106 271.6(4) MHz [12]. Since this frequency is also known with sub-MHz accuracy,

we do not expect any decrease in the precision of the measurements. However, because the

laser is diﬀerent, it requires completely new alignment of the interferometer, which gives us

a good check on systematic errors arising from any misalignment angle between the beams.

More importantly, it gives us a check on the reliability of converting wavelength ratios in air

to vacuum using Edlen’s formula because the reference wavelength has changed from 780

The results of the second set of measurements are listed in Table II. The values for the

D1 and D2 lines of K are consistent with the earlier results in Table I, within the quoted

errors. Therefore, we have strong reason to believe that our systematic errors are less than

the statistical errors. Combining the results from Tables I and II, we obtain the following

The errors are statistical and systematic, respectively.

The values we obtain can be compared to the values listed in the K energy-level tables

released by the National Institute of Standards and Technology [6]: 12 985.170 cm−1 for

the 4P1/2 state; 13 042.876 cm−1 for the 4P3/2 state, and 57.706 cm−1 for the ﬁne-structure

interval. Our results are consistent with these values but have signiﬁcantly higher accuracy,

thus demonstrating the power of our technique to improve the accuracy of the existing

energy-level tables.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a diode laser stabilized on a Rb transition

can be used as an absolute frequency reference to make precise measurements of the energy

levels in atoms. The reference laser and a laser tuned to the atomic transition of interest are

fed into a scanning Michelson interferometer to obtain their frequency ratio very precisely.

We have used this technique to make frequency measurements on the D1 and D2 lines

of K, and obtain improvement of about an order of magnitude over existing values. The

leading source of systematic error is non-parallelism between the two laser beams in the

interferometer. While we have several checks to minimize this error, it cancels to ﬁrst order

in the determination of the ﬁne-structure interval. The technique should prove useful in other

atomic systems and particularly alkali atoms, where transitions are easily accessible with

tunable diode lasers and knowledge of ﬁne-structure intervals is important. Since atomic

energy levels are generally known to about 0.01 cm−1 accuracy, our precision wavemeter [3]

has the potential to improve these values by up to two orders of magnitude.

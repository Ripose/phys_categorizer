We have simulated the dynamics of interacting atoms in optical lattices. The periodic lattice struc-
ture is produced with laser beams detuned a few linewidths to the red from the atomic transition.
The atoms localize in lattice sites as a steady state is reached during the cooling, but they can still
to some extent move between the sites. Our Monte Carlo Wave Function simulations show that in
such situations the interactions can lead to evaporative cooling of the atoms as the hotter ones are
ejected from the lattice.

Neutral atoms can be cooled and trapped in light-
induced optical lattices [1]. By controlling the laser light
one can adjust the properties of the lattices in order to
study e.g. the quantum nature of atomic motion in a pe-
riodic structure [2], including the analogues to the behav-
ior of electrons in periodic solid state lattices [3]. Ideas
regarding the possibility to use optical lattices in atom
optics and quantum computation have also emerged re-
cently [4–7]. In experiments the trapped gas density is
typically very low, providing at best a ﬁlling ratio of 10 %
for the near red detuned lattices [1]. Thus it is normally
a very good approximation to ignore that the atoms in-
teract with each other. In magneto-optical traps for cold
atoms the interaction processes are highly inelastic and
limit the numbers and temperatures achievable for the
atomic gas as densities increase to about 1011 atoms/cm3
[8]. By using Bose-Einstein condensates or combining
lattices and other types of optical traps it is becoming
possible to obtain ﬁlling ratios close to unity and even
higher [9]. Applications such as quantum computing re-
quire atoms to interact in order to perform quantum log-
ical operations [5,6].

Controlled interaction studies could be performed
e.g. by superimposing two optical lattices, which can be
moved in respect to each other [6]. This, however, does
not answer the question of what happens in a basic lattice
conﬁguration when the ﬁlling ratio increases, especially
when the interactions become an unseparable part of the
cooling process, including the localization of atoms at
lattice sites. For low densities the atom cloud reaches
a thermal equilibrium state, and based on the studies
in magneto-optical traps one would expect that inelastic
interactions increase the temperature of this equilibrium
state as the gas density increases [10]. We have performed
Monte Carlo simulations of two atoms in a lattice. They
show that (for the parameters of our study) an equilib-
rium is not easily obtained.
Instead, one observes an
evaporative cooling process.

The main atomic interaction process in lattices is that

two cold atoms get close enough to each other to form a
long–range quasimolecule [8]. Compared to single atoms,
such a molecule interacts diﬀerently with the surrounding
laser light, and this interaction depends strongly on the
interatomic distance. Previously the atomic interactions
in lattices have usually been modelled by assuming ﬁxed
positions for both atoms and calculating how the atomic
energy levels are shifted by the interaction [11–14]. Such
static models ignore the dynamical nature of the inelas-
tic processes. But to allow the atoms to move makes the
problem complicated and computationally tedious. We
present in this Letter a study of interactions in a lattice
between moving atoms. Once the dynamical processes
are understood, they can be used as input for macro-
scopic theories.

The distribution of atoms in an optical lattice depends
on the choice of laser ﬁeld conﬁguration and the atomic
level structure. The laser ﬁeld should have a spatially
changing polarization, and the atom needs at least two
Zeeman sublevels in the lower energy state, and a diﬀer-
ent angular momentum in the upper energy state. The
interaction between the laser ﬁeld and an atom gives rise
to periodic light-induced potentials for atoms in the Zee-
man states of their internal ground states. A single atom
moving in such a lattice will undergo Sisyphus cooling
because of optical pumping from one ground state to an-
other, in a manner that favors the reduction of kinetic
energy between the rapid optical pumping cycles [15].
This cooling eﬀect takes place rapidly in lattices created
by lasers which are tuned only a few linewidths below
the atomic transition (red-detuned bright lattices). Af-
ter cooling, the atoms are to a large extent localized in
these potential wells.

We have chosen as a basis for our studies the simplest
atomic transition for a red-detuned laser ﬁeld, i.e., a sys-
tem with a lower state angular momentum Jg = 1/2 and
an upper state angular momentum Je = 3/2. We de-
note the ﬁrst state as the ground state |g±1/2i, the index
referring to the quantum number m for the eigenvalue

1

of the z projection of the angular momentum operator,
Jz. Similarly, we denote the second state as the excited
state, with eigenstates |e±3/2i and |e±1/2i. The reso-
nance frequency of the transition is ω0. In the numerical
calculations we have used the atomic properties of Cs.

The laser ﬁeld has periodicity in one dimension, and
consists of two linearly polarized counter-propagating
beams, with orthogonal linear polarization and frequency
ω. For this conﬁguration, the combined laser ﬁeld is

E(z, t) = E0(exeikz − ieye−ikz)e−iωt + c.c.,

(1)

where E0 is the amplitude and k is the wavenumber.
When the interactions become important, the atomic
cloud is still relatively dilute so that only two atoms at
a time are involved, and the dipole-dipole interaction
(DDI) dominates the process. We calculate the two-atom
DDI potentials following the procedure described in Ap-
pendix A of Ref. [16]. We consider two atoms interact-
ing with the laser ﬁeld, coupled to a reservoir, namely
the vacuum electric ﬁeld. The system Hamiltonian reads
(after rotating wave approximation)

Hs = Xα=1,2

p2
α
2M − ¯hδPe,α + V,

(2)

where the sum over α is over the two atoms, δ is the
detuning δ = ω − ω0, M = 133 a.u. is the Cs atom mass,
and Pe,α = P3/2
m=−3/2 |emiα αhem|. The potential V gives
the interaction with the laser ﬁeld. The strength of this
interaction is given by the Rabi frequency Ω = 2dE0/¯h
where d is the dipole moment of the transition.
The system interacts with the reservoir through a
dipole coupling between the atoms and the vacuum
modes. As we want an expression for the DDI poten-
tial, we concentrate our eﬀort on the calculations leading
to an expression like Eq. (25) of Ref. [16], which origi-
nates from the commutator between the system density
operator, ρ, and the DDI potential, Vdip. Also, we con-
centrate on spontaneous terms, i.e., terms with vanishing
average photon number. Let us introduce the operators

(3)

where CGq
m are the appropriate Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃ-
cients and q is the polarization label in spherical basis.
Furthermore, we use a description in terms of a center of
mass coordinate Z and a relative coordinate r = r2 − r1
(with coordinate along the quantization axis z = z2−z1).
With these coordinates, the interaction potential with
the laser ﬁeld reads

In order to calculate the DDI term, we look at the
Hamiltonian part of the damping terms in the equation
of motion for the system density operator ρ. After ma-
nipulations similar to those presented in appendix A of
Ref. [16], and using arguments from Ref. [17] to evalu-
ate integrals of Bessel functions multiplied with principal
value functions, we ﬁnd the DDI potentials between the
two atoms. In the following we look only at atoms on
the axis of the laser ﬁeld, i.e., a one-dimensional situa-
tion, and in this case, the DDI potential reduces to

Numerical simulation of the motion of atoms in the lat-
tice ﬁeld in one dimension only, using the Monte Carlo
Wave Function (MCWF) method [18], is computation-
ally very demanding [19]. In order to perform two-atom
studies, which require even in one dimension at least two
translational degrees of freedom, we have ﬁxed one atom
in position, and let the other one move freely. This ﬁxes
the relation between the lattice coordinates and the rela-
tive interatomic coordinate. Thus an inelastic interaction
process will not change the kinetic energy for both atoms,
but we use the relative kinetic energy as an estimate for
the kinetic energy change per atom.
(We express en-
ergy and momentum in recoil units: Er = ¯h2k2/2M and
pr = ¯hk respectively).

We have formulated the problem in the two-atom basis,
which leads to a system of 36 internal states. In studies
for magneto-optical traps one tends to use the molecu-
lar frame, where the atom-atom interactions have been
included to the molecular potential structure [20]. How-
ever, the quantum jump processes needed for the Monte
Carlo method are easier to describe in the atomic basis.
One aspect of the simulations is that we do not use the
adiabatic elimination of the excited states [21], which is
typically employed in order to simplify the equations for
atomic motion. For simplicity we neglect Doppler cool-
ing. In the molecular frame the system of two interacting
atoms is excited resonantly to a molecular state with an
attractive interatomic potential (see Fig. 1). This leads
to the acceleration of the relative motion of the atoms,
until the process terminates with spontaneous decay. We
use these attractive potentials for the verbal description
of the process but it must be emphasised that they do
not directly appear in the two-atom basis. The kinetic
energy change due to the attractive potentials also com-
plicates greatly the numerical simulations by demanding

larger momentum and ﬁner spatial grid than in the single
atom Sisyphus cooling simulations [22].

We use the laser parameters δ = −3Γ and Ω = 1.5Γ
corresponding to a lattice modulation depth of U0 =
584Er. These parameters correspond to a lattice where
the atoms move from one lattice site to another on a
timescale that is comparable to the timescale of a har-
monic oscillation within one of the lattice potential wells.
In our selected system the atomic interactions are too
weak to really destroy the lattice, so the actual case of
interest is the one where the atoms need to be simulta-
neously at the same lattice site.

In the MCWF method an approximation for the two-
atom steady state density matrix is obtained as an en-
semble average of diﬀerent wave function histories, for
which the spontaneous emission occurs as probabilistic
quantum jumps [18]. These quantum jumps (both atoms
in our case have six decay channels) occur according
to probabilities weighted by the appropriate Clebsch-
Gordan coeﬃcients of the decay channels. There are
various ways how to calculate the results by ensemble
averaging. We take the ensemble average of single his-
tory time averages in the steady state time domain [23].
Thus we obtain the kinetic energy per atom, and the spa-
tial and momentum probability distributions for various
occupation densities (ρo) of the lattice.

A comparison between the number of atoms having
gained large kinetic energy via interactions and the total
number of interaction processes show (see Table I) that
basically every interaction process produces hot atoms in
our chosen parameter range. This leads to an evaporative
cooling process in the optical lattice: those atoms which
are able to move from one well to the other and which
have larger kinetic energy than localized atoms leave the
trap. A crucial ingredient in the interaction process in-
creasing the kinetic energy by a large amount and leading
to evaporation is that a large fraction of the population
has to enter the attractive molecular excited state during
the interaction process. This fraction in turn depends on
the relative velocity between the interacting atoms when
they reach the resonance point for the attractive molec-
ular states. The relative velocity in turn depends on the
lattice depth. In our simulations the surroundings is still
favorable so that the relative velocity between atoms is
low enough to keep the excitation probability high when
atoms approach each other and cross the molecular res-
onance point.

The number of attractive molecular states is ﬁve (with
two degenerate ones) and the resonant excitation to these
potentials takes place at diﬀerent interatomic distances
(see Fig. 1) [20]. If the atoms do not get a large increase in
kinetic energy at the ﬁrst resonance they reach, there are
still other resonances left. A comparison with semiclas-
sical (SC) excitation and survival calculations suggests
that the potential which becomes resonant ﬁrst when the
atoms approach each other has the dominant role in the

3

interaction process.

When calculating the steady state kinetic energy per
atom (Table I), we use two critical wavenumbers kc.
Wavefunction histories which at some time point have
gained larger total kinetic energy than given by kc are ne-
glected in ensemble averaging (considered lost from the
lattice). The smallest value of kc we use [24] is more
than two times larger than the semiclassical critical value
ksc
c given in Ref. [15]. The denser the lattice is initially,
the larger is the number of interaction processes and the
more eﬀective is the evaporative cooling process. This
can be seen in the results for kinetic energy per atom
using kc = 40 (see Table I). The kinetic energy decreases
when the initial density of the lattice increases. Results
with kc = 70 include atoms that are lost from the lat-
tice, and the value of kinetic energy is slightly above the
sparse lattice (non-interacting case) result.

The momentum distribution in Fig. 2 shows the eﬀect
of the evaporative cooling process clearly. Due to the
interactions between atoms part of the population has
shifted to the region of large k (wings in Fig. 2) and does
not localize back to the lattice because the atoms are
above the recapture range. Thus the central peak of the
momentum distribution corresponding to atoms localized
at lattice sites has a 13% narrower FWHM for an initially
dense lattice compared to the non-interacting case.

We have shown that at high-density, red-detuned
(a few linewidths) optical lattices, atomic interactions
should lead to the ejection of the hotter atoms from the
lattice. This is because (a) atoms may move from one
lattice site to another even in the steady state for Sisy-
phus cooling, and (b) because the molecular interaction
is strong enough to give to each clearly interacting atom
pair almost always enough energy to escape from the lat-
tice. Earlier simulations for roughly the same laser (and
Cs) parameters in magneto-optical traps have indicated
that the dominating eﬀect would be a clear broadening of
the atomic momentum distribution, i.e., radiative heat-
ing [10]. In both situations high-momentum atoms are
produced, but in magneto-optical traps the production
is independent of initial relative momentum, whereas in
optical lattices atoms with higher momentum are favored
(in both cases the fast atoms get involved in more close
encounters than the slow ones, but in lattices working
in our selected parameter region this fact becomes en-
hanced).

[22] Due to the large kinetic energies involved, the spatial step
size ∆z has to be smaller than in single atom simulations
since the momentum space size Lk = 2π/∆z. We use the
split operator Fourier method to solve the non–Hermitian
time–dependent Schr¨odinger equation. The density of the
lattice is controlled by changing the length Lz of the nu-
merical grid.

[24] The semiclassical value ksc

(from Ref. [15]) gives the
point where the cooling force has its maximum value, but
the cooling is still eﬀective above that point. Our values
of kc gives us a criterion for neglecting energetic histories
from the ensemble (i.e., atoms lost from the lattice).

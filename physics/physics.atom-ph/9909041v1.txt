An analysis of the channel wave functions is made to clarify the types
of resonance emerging from the Ps-Ps and Ps-Ps* collisions . The ordering
of the energy levels of the states of the dipositronium is evaluated based
on the inherent nodal structures of wave functions and on existing theo-
retical results. A few very probable low-lying narrower resonances, namely

Since the discovery of the positron the investigation of the systems com-
posed of positrons and electrons becomes an attractive topic. These sys-
tems might exist in astrophysical processes and might play an important
role in astronomical evolution. Experimentally, the (e+e−) , (e+e−e−), and
(e+e+e−) systems together with their excited states have long been found in
laboratories. However, the (e+e+e−e−) system, namely the dipositronium
Ps2, has not yet been found. Theoretically, in recent years the existence
of the ground state of Ps2 has been predicted by a number of authors1−4,
an excited bound state with LΠ = 1− (here L is the total orbital angular
momentum, Π is the parity) has been predicted in the ref.[5], and two more
excited bound 0+ states have also been predicted in ref.[1,6]. Obviously, in
addition to these bound states, resonances of Ps2 might also exist, and they
might emerge during Ps-Ps and Ps-Ps* collisions (here Ps and Ps* denote
the ground state and the excited state, respectively, of the (e+e−) system).
In this paper, a qualitative analysis is performed to evaluate what types of
low-lying resonances might be observed during the above collisions.

Let us start from the Ps-Ps collision. Let the two positrons be called the
particles 1 and 2, while the two electrons be 3 and 4. Let us assume that
the spins of the positrons are coupled to s1, and those of the electrons are
coupled to s2, and χs1s2 is the spin state. Let the spatial wave function of
a Ps in its ground state be denoted as Φ. Then the antisymmetrized wave

It is obvious from (4) that the channel should have s1 + s2+L= even.
When L=even, it is clear from (4) that

Equation (5) implies that the spatial wave function

should be invariant to p13p24 if L is even.

Furthermore, since the ground state of Ps has an even parity, the parity

of the channel Π is therefore equal to (-1)l = (−1)L.

On the other hand, the eigenstates of the dipositronium Ps2 can be clas-
siﬁed by the rotation group, space inversion group, and D2d point group1,7.
Thus an eigenstate (bound state or resonance) can be labeled as LΠ
i (µ),
where µ denotes one of the representations A1, A2, B1, B2, and E of the D2d
group; the subscript i denotes the i − th state of a series of states with the
same L, Π,and µ . The i = 1 state is the lowest of the series. In some cases
the subscript i may be omitted if it is not necessary to appear. Incidentally,
µ is related to s1 and s2 as listed in Table 17. Furthermore, when µ = A1

Evidently, the good quantum numbers of a resonance should match those
of the channel wave functions. Thus, during the Ps-Ps collision, only the
resonances with

(i) s1 + s2+L= even,
(ii) Λ = 1 if L is even,
(iii) parity Π = (−1)L
can be induced . Consequently, three types of resonances , namely the
i (A1) states with an even L, the L+
L+
i (B1) states with an even L, and the
−
i (E) states with an odd L, might emerge during Ps-Ps collision. It is noted
L
that the observation of a resonance depends on its width. If the width is
very broad, then the observation is diﬃcult or even impossible. Therefore,
the above three types of resonances might not all be observed.

The width of a resonance depends on how the wave function is distributed
in the channel region and in the interior.
If the amplitude of the wave
function is small in the channel region (as to be compared with the amplitude
in the interior), then the width is narrow and the state is nearly stable. If
it is large in the channel region, then the width is broad. When the width
is broad, the resonance is diﬃcult to be identiﬁed and therefore might not
be observed.

When the energy of a state is higher than the threshold of a channel and
when the quantum numbers of the state match those of the channel, there
are two factors to hinder the wave function in the interior from extending to
the channel region. One is the diﬀerence in structure between the channel
wave function and the wave function in the interior. When the diﬀerence is
large, the extension of the wave function is diﬃcult, and therefore the width
is small. The other one is the centrifugal barrier and the Coulomb barrier.
These barriers play their role only if the bombarding energy is low. Thus
they are important to low-lying resonances in general. However, since the
Ps and Ps* are neutral in charge, the Coulomb barrier is unimportant in
our case, but the centrifugal barrier might be important. In what follows
we shall study the eﬀect of this barrier to the low-lying resonances.

Let us study the low-lying resonances with L≤ 2 induced by Ps-Ps colli-
sion with the threshold energy -0.5 (atomic units are used in this paper). It
has been calculated1 that the energies of the 0+
1 (B1) are -0.4995
and -0.4994, respectively . Both are a little higher than the Ps-Ps threshold
and therefore they might be observed as resonances. However, since in this

2 (A1) and 0+

3

case there is no centrifugal barrier to hinder the wave function, the widths
of these two resonances might be broad. Thus, even if the calculation in the
ref. [1] is correct, these resonances might not be observed.

The energy of the 1

1 (µ) states with L6=0.

It was found7 that the 1

−
1 (E) state has never been calculated. Nonetheless,
it was known from all existing theoretical calculations that the energy of a
state would be high if the wave function contains many nodal surfaces; the
more the nodal surfaces, the higher the energy. Besides, it was found that
the ﬁrst-states (the i = 1 states) either do not contain any nodal surface,
or contain only the inherent nodal surfaces8,9. Thus the inherent nodal
structures can be used to evaluate the ordering of the ﬁrst-states. More
speciﬁcally, for the dipositronium, the ordering of the 0+
1 (µ) levels have
been found to be just ordered according to the number of inherent nodal
surfaces that they contain7. This fact should also be true for the group
−
of other LΠ
i (E) states do
not contain inherent nodal surfaces, while all the other L=1 states contain
−
inherent nodal surfaces7. Thus the 1
1 (E) state is the lowest L=1 state.
−
1 (B2) is -0.3344. The

−
energy of the 1
1 (E) is lower than -0.5, then it is bound. If the energy is
higher, then it is a resonance. It is noted that the ﬁrst excited L=0 state
and the lowest L=1 state of the positronium have exactly the same energy.
This is in general not true for other systems. However, the energies of the
−
0+
2 (A1) and the 1
1 (E) of the dipositronium might be close. If this is true,
−
1 (E) would be close to -0.4995 . On the other hand,
the energy of the 1
the centrifugal barrier is equal to l(l+1)
2r2 − 0.5, where l is the relative partial
wave of the two Ps, and r is the relative distance of the two Ps. Once the
channel radius has been evaluated, the height of the barrier can be known.
It is noted that the radius of a Ps is equal to 2, the channel radius should be
considerably larger than this value. When the channel radius is given from
4 to 6, then the height of the p−wave barrier is from -0.4375 to -0.4722.
−
So, if the energy of the 1
1 (E) is considerably lower than the height of the
barrier (e.g., the energy is close to -0.4995), the collapse of the state would be
eﬀectively hindered and accordingly the width would be narrower. In brief
−
, there are three possibilities. If the energy of the 1
1 (E) is lower than -0.5,
the state is bound; if it is a little higher than -0.5, it is a narrow resonance
and thereby can be easily observed; if it is much higher than -0.5, it might
be a broad resonance and might not be observed.

The 2+

while the other 2Π
1 (B1) states
are the two lowest L=2 states. It is very unlikely that they would be lower
than the threshold at -0.5, thus they are likely to be resonances. If their
energies are considerably lower than the height of the d−wave barrier (e.g.,
their energies are lower than -0.46), they would have narrower widths and
might be observed. Otherwise, the widths might be broad and the observa-
tion might be diﬃcult.
In conclusion, the 1

Let us study the low-lying resonances with L≤ 2 induced by Ps-Ps*(2p)

For the case of L=0, the p−wave of the Ps-Ps*(2p) collision can induce
the 0+(E), 0+(B2), and 0+(A2) resonances. However, it was shown in the
ref.[1] that the 0+
1 (B2) states are lower than the threshold, thus
they can not be induced. Nonetheless, their higher states (e.g., the 0+
2 (E) )
might be observed if they are higher than and close to the threshold due to
the p−wave barrier. The energy of the 0+
1 (A2)
is only a little higher than the threshold, the p-wave barrier should act
eﬀectively. Thus the width of this resonance should be narrow and therefore
can be easily observed. The search of this resonance is an interesting topic.
For the case of L=1, odd-parity resonances may be induced by s-wave
while even-parity resonances can only be induced by p-wave. Thus, even-
parity states in general might have a narrower width. Three kinds of even-
parity states, namely the 1+(A2), 1+(B2), and 1+(E), can be induced. It
was found that the wave function of the 1+(A2) is allowed by symmetry to
be distributed surrounding a square with a pair of the same kind of particles
located at the two ends of a diagonal (this geometric conﬁguration is denoted
as SQ), while the wave function of the 1−(B2) is not allowed7. The SQ is the

5

most favorable conﬁguration in favor of binding. Since the SQ is accessible
to 1+(A2) but not accessible to 1−(B2), the 1+
1 (A2) would be lower than
−
the 1
1 (B2). The latter has an energy -0.3344, thus the former would be
lower than the threshold and therefore might be bound. It was found7 that
the 1+(B2) and 1+(E) contain more inherent nodal surfaces than the 1−(B2)
contains. Thus the 1+
1 (E) would be higher than -0.3344. If their
energies are higher than but close to the threshold -0.3125, they would have
narrower widths and therefore might be observed. If they are much higher
than the threshold, they would have a broad width and therefore diﬃcult
to be observed.

1 (B2) and 1+

For the L=2 resonances, the bombarding wave should at least have l =
1(2) if the parity is even (odd). Since the energies of L=2 states have never
been evaluated, it is diﬃcult to evaluate which resonances can be observed
at this moment. Nonetheless, the odd parity resonances might have a larger
possibility to be observed due to having a higher centrifugal barrier. Among
the odd states the 2−(B2) and 2−(A2) should be very high due to having
so many inherent nodal surfaces7, while the 2−(E) should be lower because
−
the SQ is accessible to this state. If the 2
1 (E) is lower than -0.3125, it is
bound because the Ps-Ps channel is close to it; if it is higher than and close
to -0.3125, it would be a resonance with a narrower width.

1 (B2), 1+

In conclusion, a number of LΠ

i (µ) resonances with µ =A2, B2, and E
might be induced in Ps-Ps*(2p) collision (among them the L=0 resonances
have an even parity). Where the most probable narrower low-lying resonance
is the 0+
1 (A2). The existence of the other suggested narrower low-lying
resonance, namely the 1+

−
1 (E) , and 2
1 (E) , is also possible
Let us study the low-lying resonances with L≤ 2 induced by Ps-Ps*(2s)
collision with also the threshold energy -0.3125. From an analysis similar
to the above, LΠ(µ) resonances with Π = (−1)L and µ =A1, B1, and E
might be induced. However, the L=0 resonances do not contain centrifugal
−
−
barrier, thus they have broad widths. The 1
1 (A1) and 1
1 (B1) contain many
inherent nodal surfaces just as the 0+
1 (A2) state7, but the energies of the
former two should be considerably higher than the latter (at -0.3121) due
to the diﬀerence in L, thus the former should be considerably higher than
the threshold -0.3125. Thus they can not take advantage from the p−wave
−
barrier, and therefore have a broad width. The 1
1 (E) has been mentioned
that it might appear as a narrower resonance emerging from Ps-Ps collision.
−
It is possible that the 1
2 (E) resonance might be observed during the Ps-
Ps*(2s) collision. Among the L=2 states, the 2+
1 (E) has the same inherent
−
1 (B2)7. The former should considerably higher
nodal structure just as the 1

6

than the latter (at -0.3344) due to the diﬀerence in L, but may not much
higher than the threshold -0.3125. Thus the 2+
1 (E) may take advantage from
the d− wave barrier and therefore has a narrower width, and thereby can
be observed.

In summary, an analysis based on symmetry has been performed in this
paper. Which types of resonance would emerge during the Ps-Ps and Ps-
Ps* collisions is clariﬁed via the analysis of the channel wave functions. The
ordering of the energy levels of the states of the dipositronium is evaluated
based on the inherent nodal structures of wave functions and on existing
theoretical results. How the widths are aﬀected by the centrifugal barrier has
been discussed. Emphasis is placed on the states that might have an energy
higher than and close to the Ps-Ps or Ps-Ps* threshold. A few very probable
low-lying narrower resonances beneﬁting from the centrifugal barrier have
been proposed. The existence of these suggested narrower resonances remain
to be checked.

Although the above qualitative analysis can only talk about the possibil-
ities but does not give deﬁnite quantitative results, the analysis is still useful
because it can help us to understand the physics underlying the forthcoming
experimental data and theoretical results. Speciﬁcallly, as a ﬁrst step, the
experiment for the identiﬁcation of the 0+
1 (A2) resonance via the Ps-Ps*(2p)
collision is suggested. If this resonance can not be found, this state would be
−
the ﬁfth bound state (together with the 0+
1 (B2)
1 (B2), and 1
that have been theoretically conﬁrmed to be bound ).

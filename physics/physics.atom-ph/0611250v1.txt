Crystals of metallic rubidium are observed “growing” from paraﬃn coating of buﬀer-gas-free glass
vapor cells. The crystals have uniform square cross-section, ≈ 35 µm on the side, and reach several
mm in length.

PACS numbers: 81.10.Bk

For many years, we have been using glass alkali-metal
vapor cells with inner walls coated with paraﬃn. High-
quality paraﬃn coatings [1, 2] have the “magical” prop-
erty that polarized alkali atoms may bounce between the
cell walls several thousand times before they depolarize,
which has led to wide-spread application of such cells
anywhere where long-lived atomic polarization is desired,
for example, in optical atomic magnetometers [3].

While condensation of the alkali metal on the paraﬃn
coated walls is usually carefully avoided, and the excess
metal is located in the cell “stem” (see Fig. 1), in some
of the cells, we have observed needle-like metal crystals
shown on the insets of Fig. 1, that have “grown” from
the paraﬃn coating and have reached the length of up to
2-3 mm in about a two-month’s time since the cells were
made (our coating procedure is described in Ref.
[4]).
The crystals are all of regular square cross-section, ≈
35 µm on the side, terminating on a sharp-vertex pyramid
at the ends of the needle.

The observed rate of growth indicates that an atom
from the vapor phase that hits the crystal at the pris-
matic part of the needle near the vertex has sticking
probability of order unity, or that atoms adsorbed in a
“wrong” place on the crystal somehow migrate towards
the end of the needle.

While most of the whiskers are perpendicular to the
cell wall, occasionally, we ﬁnd needles that grow at an
angle.

A quick e-mail poll of the workers who have studied
paraﬃn coated cells has revealed that, while most of them
have not seen alkali-metal whiskers, the paraﬃn-coating
pioneer, Hugh Robinson (now at NIST, Boulder), has, in
fact, ﬁrst observed their formation some 20 years ago, and
was even able to stimulate their formation by providing
a “cold spot” on the surface of the cell. Unfortunately,
Robinson’s results remain unpublished.

As it turns out, rubidium is a member of a large “fam-
ily” of metals that tend to grow whiskers. In fact, tin,
zinc, and gold whiskers represent a signiﬁcant problem for
electronics industry, as they can lead to electrical shorts

and failure of electronic equipment. NASA maintains an
informative web site [5] devoted to metal whiskers, how-
ever, alkali metals have not as yet been featured. There
are also reports of bismuth whiskers growing in a heat-
pipe vapor cell [6].

Alkali-metal needles may also present certain prob-
lems, for example, in the work that requires application
of high-voltage electric ﬁeld to coated cells [7]. On the
other hand, they might also prove useful as a way to
manufacture alkali-metal wires, for which one interesting
application is loading a dense cryogenic buﬀer gas with
the alkali metal by laser ablation from of the end of a
micron-sized wires [8].

We are grateful to W. Happer, L. R. Hunter, H. G.
Robinson, and M. Zolotorev for useful comments, and to

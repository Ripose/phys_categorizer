We present VUV observations of transitions between doubly excited sextet states in O3+, F4+ and
Ne5+. Spectra were produced by collisions of an oxygen, ﬂuorine and neon beam with a nitrogen gas
jet target. Prepared beam-gas experiment yields new and explicit information on doubly core-excited
ions. Some observed lines were assigned to the 1s2s2p3 6S-1s2p33s, 3d 6P electric-dipole transitions
in O3+, F4+ and Ne5+. Three lines have been reassigned. Present data are the ﬁrst explicit
measurements on transitions between sextet states in boronlike ions by beam-gas spectroscopy.

PACS numbers: 32.70.-n, 39.30.+w, 31.10.+z, 31.15.Ar

The sextet states of doubly excited boronlike ions are
possible candidates for x-ray and VUV-lasers [1], and
have been investigated recently. The lowest terms of this
system (1s2s2p3 6S, 1s2s2p23s 6P and 1s2s2p33d 6P) have
been studied along the B I sequence [2, 3, 4]. The stud-
ies of higher excited sextet states (1s2p33s 6S) have been
lately reported [1]. However, the energy level diagrams
of these ions are still far from complete. Experimen-
tally, these levels are diﬃcult to observe by conventional
spectroscopy techniques, such as the high voltage dis-
charge in gas cell method, because they lie well above sev-
eral ionization limits of ﬁve-electron singlet states. Even
though they are metastable against autoionization, they
usually de-excite and disappear by collisions with other
ions without radiative transitions. The fast beam-foil
technique allows straight forward observations of the ra-
diative transitions produced by these sextet states [5, 6]
along B I sequence.

In 1992 the beam-foil spectroscopy [2, 3] was used to
provide initial data on low-lying sextet states in boron-
like nitrogen, oxygen and ﬂuorine. The recent work of
Lapierre and Knystautas [3] on possible sextet transi-
tions in Ne VI highlights the signiﬁcance in this sequence.
They measured several excitation energies and lifetimes.
The ﬁne structures of individual 1s2s2p23s 6PJ states
were resolved and measured in O IV, F V and Ne VI
by Lin and Berry et al [1]. There are no further results
reported for transitions from sextet states in boronlike
system.

In some works on beam-foil spectroscopy of sextet
states in B I isoelectronic sequence, their identiﬁcations
show rather weak lines and overwhelming blending prob-
lems. Hence, accurate theoretical studies of sextet states
in doubly excited B I isoelectronic sequence are strongly
needed to help identiﬁcations. However, the theoreti-
cal analysis of these ﬁve-electron ions is diﬃcult because

strong electron correlation, relativistic corrections, and
even QED eﬀects have to be included in the calcula-
tions [1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].

Doublet and quartet transitions in core-excited boron-
like ions have been studied successfully using beam-gas
collision spectroscopy [15, 16]. Well prepared beam-gas
spectroscopy of oxygen, ﬂuorine and neon ions is a possi-
ble technique to study the sextet transitions in boronlike
O IV, F V and Ne VI. The sextet states in B I isoelec-
tronic sequence are well above several ionization levels
and metastable against electric-dipole radiation decay to
singly excited ﬁve-electron states and against Coulomb
autoionization into the adjacent continuum 1s22l’2l”nl
4L due to diﬀerent spin multiplicity. Thus, the main de-
cay channel is radiation in beam-gas experiments. The
lifetimes of the ground quintet states in boronlike ions
are long enough (about 10−5 second for O V) so that
the ”prepared” beryllium-like ions, excited to metastable
quintet states by collisions with nitrogen gas molecular,
can reach alkaline vapor target atoms. The spectra ob-
tained have signiﬁcant features emitted from core-excited
ions and very clean background because of, after careful
preparation and selection of the ion beam, the dominant
core-conserving single-electron pick-up cross-sections of
metastable doubly excited ions at low beam energy in
alkaline vapor cell.

Presented herein are the ﬁrst measurements on the
1s2s2p3 6S-1s2s2p23s, 3d 6P electric-dipole transitions
in boronlike O IV, F V and Ne VI by well prepared
beam-gas spectroscopy. Comparison is given with the
recent results of measurements from beam-foil spec-
troscopy [2, 3], and multi-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock
(MCHF) and multi-conﬁguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF)
calculations [2, 3, 4] for the transitions.

In this work, the beam-gas spectra of oxygen, ﬂuorine
and neon at low beam energy were previously recorded
at Lyon using grating incidence spectrometers. The ex-
perimental arrangement in Fig.
1 was used [15, 16].
Multi-charged ions extracted from a 14 MHz CAPRICE
ECR ion source of the AIM, a joint CEA/CNRS facility
at CEA Grenoble with acceleration voltage of 2-20 kV,
were mass and charge analyzed by two bending magnets

states.

and sent into the beam line devoted to UV spectroscopy.
A nitrogen gas jet target was placed between the two
magnets. After electron capture collisions in a cesium
cell, photons emitted were detected at 90 degrees to the
ion beam direction by a 2.2 m- McPherson grazing in-
cidence spectrometer equipped with a position-sensitive
microchannel plate detector which allows simultaneous
recording of spectral lines within a wavelength region of
about 50 ˚A in the range of 60-600 ˚A.

The spectra of ﬂuorine recorded in above experiments
are shown in Figs. 2. In the ”direct” F5+ beam (simi-
lar for O 4+ and Ne 6+ ion beams), the fraction of the
ions in the F5+(1s22s2) state is high, about 97%, and
that of the F5+(1s22s3s) metastable state is low, about
3%.
In the upper ﬁgure of Fig. 2 one sees that the
transitions between doublet terms are dominant. In the
”prepared” F5+ beam, the fraction of the ions in the
F5+(1s22s2p 3P0,1,2) state increases to about 45%, that
of the F5+(1s22s2) state decreases to about 50%. The life-
time of the F5+(1s2s2p2 5P1,2,3) quintet metastable state
is long enough for such ions to reach the second excitation
region, the cesium cell. The fraction of the ions in the
F5+(1s2s2p2 5P1,2,3) quintet metastable state is about
5% at the energy (>1 keV/amu). The fraction of transi-
tions between quartet terms increase dramatically, as well
as that of transitions between sextet terms. In the lower
ﬁgure of Fig. 2 the transition labelled as P is identiﬁed as
the 1s2s2p3 6So - 1s2s2p23s6P electric-dipole transitions,
which does not appear in the direct spectrum. Please be
noted that the 2s2p2 2D-2s2p(1Po)3d 2Fo transition is at
wavelength of 158.95 ˚A in the direct spectrum, which de-
creases dramatically in the prepared spectrum, whereas

Shown in Fig.3 are the prepared spectra of oxygen, ﬂu-
orine and neon obtained in above beam-gas experiments.
The 1s2s2p3 6S - 1s2s2p23s, 3d 6P electric-dipole tran-
sitions in O IV, F V and Ne VI have been searched in
these clean spectra. The observed 1s2s2p3 6S - 1s2s2p23s
6P electric-dipole transitions at wavelength of 120.04 ˚A
[3] is conﬁrmed. The observed 1s2s2p3 6S -

for Ne VI [2, 3] are absent. Meanwhile, we have found
some notable features were unidentiﬁed, which are un-
able to be seen in direct spectra. Shown in Fig. 4 are
the details of the 1s2s2p3 6So

sition in O IV. Here the transition rates from the ﬁne

calculation by this work. The wavelengths of the ﬁne
structure components were calculated SCHF results plus
a ﬁtted shift for all three components. The Gaussian
curves of the three components utilized the experimental

the three ﬁne structure components is a least-squared ﬁt-
ting of the measured data. The measured wavelength of
the transition of 227.13±0.04 is the weighted center of the
ﬁtted proﬁle of experimental data using the above theo-
retical analysis. After studying the details of the transi-
tions theoretically and experimentally described above,
and comparing with the measured results of O IV,F
V and Ne VI from beam-foil experiments [2, 3], and
multi-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock (MCHF) and multi-
conﬁguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) calculations of F V
and Ne VI [2, 3, 4], we assign some unidentiﬁed observed
lines as the 1s2s2p3 6S - 1s2s2p23s, 3d 6P electric-dipole
transitions in O IV, F V and Ne VI. Results of the identi-
ﬁcation and measurements of wavelengths of transitions
between sextet states by this work and comparison are
shown in Table I. Errors of wavelengths are small mainly
from calibration and curve ﬁtting. The latter includes
experimental and statistical errors.

Present results on O IV, F V and Ne VI represent the
ﬁrst explicit experimental data on transitions between
sextet states in boronlike ions. Well prepared beam-gas
spectroscopic experiments have yielded new and explicit
information on the system. Using the calculated wave-
lengths and transition rates by this work and results by
others, we were able to assign the observed lines to the
1s2s2p3 6So-1s2p23s,3d 6P electric-dipole transitions in
O IV, F V and Ne VI, and measured the wavelengths

These measurements are part of a series aimed at un-
derstanding optical emissions and energy terms in doubly
excited sextet states in boronlike ions. The experiments

also lend reliability to the use of MFHD and MCDF ap-
proaches in calculating wavelengths and transition rates
for the transitions between sextet states in boronlike ions.

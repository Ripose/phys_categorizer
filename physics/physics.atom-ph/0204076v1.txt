There have been recent suggestions for searching for the electron electric dipole moment, using
solid state experiments with compounds containing Gd3+ ions [1,2]. These experiments could im-
prove the sensitivity compared to present atomic and molecular experiments by several orders of
magnitude. The analysis of the problem requires a calculation of the enhancement coeﬃcient K for
the electron electric dipole moment in the Gd3+ ion. In this work we perform this calculation. The
result is K ≈ −4.9 ± 1.6. Limitations of the accuracy of the calculation are mainly due to the lack
of data on Gd3+ excitation spectra. We formulate which quantities have to be measured and/or
calculated to improve the accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION

A violation of the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) has been discovered in the decay
of the K 0 meson about 40 years ago [3]. The exact origin of this symmetry violation remains an enigma, although
the standard model of electroweak interactions can describe these processes phenomenologically. It has also been
proposed by Sakharov [4] that the matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in our universe could have arisen from
a CP-violating interaction active at an early stage of the big bang. The CP-violation implies a time-reversal (T)
asymmetry and hence violation of the combined TP-symmetry, because there are strong reasons to believe that the
combined CPT-symmetry should not be violated [5]. An electric dipole moment (EDM) of a system in a stationary
quantum state indicates a violation of the TP-symmetry; this is why searches for EDMs of elementary particles,
atoms and molecules are a very important approach to the studies of violations of fundamental symmetries [6]. In
the present work we concentrate on the EDM of the electron de.

At present the best limitation on de comes from the Berkeley experiment with an atomic thallium beam [7],
de < 1.6 · 10−27 e cm. There are some ideas for improving the sensitivity. One way of improvement is an experiment
with metastable levels of PbO molecules [8]. A breakthrough could be achieved in solid state experiments. This idea
was suggested by Shapiro in 1968 [9]. The application of strong electric ﬁelds to electrons bound within a solid would
align the electric dipole moments of these electrons. This should lead to a simultaneous alignment of the electron
spins; the magnetic ﬁeld arising from this alignment could be detected experimentally. An experiment of this kind
has been performed with nickel-zinc ferrite [10]. However, due to experimental limitations, the result was not very
impressive. Interest to the approach has been renewed recently due to suggestions of Lamoreaux [1] and Hunter [2] to
perform similar experiments with gadolinium gallium garnet, Gd3Ga5O12, and gadolinium iron garnet, Gd3Fe5O12,
employing new experimental techniques. First estimates of sensitivity promise to improve the current upper limit on
the electron EDM by at least three orders of magnitude, depending on the experimental setup. A thorough analysis
of the problem requires the calculation of the enhancement coeﬃcient for the electron EDM in the Gd3+ ion. We
perform this calculation in the present work.

II. SINGLE PARTICLE CONTRIBUTION

The Gd3+ ion has a nucleus with charge Z = 64 and 61 electrons. The 7 electrons in the outer shell occupy
the 4f orbitals. So the shell is half ﬁlled, and hence the total orbital angular momentum is zero, L = 0, and total
spin S = 7/2. Let us consider the state with maximum z-projection of the spin. In the representation of second
quantization the ground state wave function is of the form

|gsi = f †

−3↑f †

−2↑f †

−1↑f †

0↑f †

1↑f †

2↑f †

3↑|0i,

(1)

where f †
The TP-odd interaction of the electron EDM with the electric ﬁeld E is of the form, see e.g. Ref. [6]

mσ is the creation operator for a 4f electron with spin σ and z-projection of orbital angular momentum lz = m.

Vd = −deγ0Σ · E,

where γ0 and Σ = γ0γ5γ are Dirac γ-matrices. Because of Schiﬀ’s theorem [11] it is crucially important to account for
very complex many-body screening eﬀects, when working with the Hamiltonian (2); technically this means that the
many-body perturbation theory practically is not convergent. The standard way [6] to avoid this complication is to
split the Hamiltonian into two terms: Vd = −deγ0Σ · E = −deΣ · E − de(γ0 − 1)Σ · E. Then due to Schiﬀ’s theorem
[11] the contribution of the ﬁrst term to the EDM of the ion is identically zero, so one can reduce the interaction

Vd → V r

d = −de(γ0 − 1)Σ · E.

Perturbation theory with this operator is reasonably convergent.

In leading order of single particle perturbation theory the EDM of the ion Dsp is given by diagrams shown in Fig.1.

Note that from here on we skip the atomic energy unit E0 in all equations, assuming that all energies are expressed
in units of E0. To ﬁnd values of the parameters that appear in this equation, we have performed a Hartree-Fock
calculation for the Gd3+ ion. It is known that a Hartree-Fock calculation for an open shell is not a uniquely deﬁned
procedure. In our calculation we used the following averaging: we assumed that the shell is fully occupied, but the
occupation number of each single particle f -orbital is 1/2. This is a crude approximation, it gives reasonable values
of energy levels and radial integrals, but one cannot rely on this calculation as far as energy splittings are concerned.
As a result of the calculation we obtained the following values of energies and radial integrals:

Where available, experimental data should be used, but unfortunately the experimental data on this particular ion is
scarce. Only the value of the 4f energy level (ionization limit) is known, see Ref. [12],

E4f = −1.65 E5d = −1.20 E5g = −0.32
r4f,5g = 0.088
r4f,5d = 0.63

E4f = −355000 cm−1 = −1.62 E0.

It agrees well with (11). From (12) and (11) one ﬁnds ν4f = 2.22, ν5d = 2.58 and ν5g = 5.0.

The most important is the E4f − E5d energy splitting. The accuracy of the present Hartree-Fock calculation is not
suﬃcient to determine this splitting. There is reliable experimental data for the energy levels of Gd2+, Gd1+, and
Eu2+, see Ref. [12]. Naive extrapolation of the splitting from these ions gives

On the other hand there is experimental data for Gd3+ [13] that indicates

A :

E5d − E4f ≈ 40, 000 cm−1 ≈ 0.18 E0.

B :

E5d − E4f ≈ 100, 000 cm−1 ≈ 0.45 E0.

Unfortunately Ref. [13] does not contain identiﬁcations of all the possible levels, therefore we cannot quite rely on the
data. For this reason we will present two estimates of K: one for the case (A), see (13), and another for the case (B),
see (14). Experimental and/or theoretical determination of the E5d − E4f splitting would be the most important to
improve the accuracy of the calculation of the enhancement coeﬃcient K.

Substituting values of the parameters listed above into eq. (10) we ﬁnd the contribution of the 5d intermediate

state to the EDM enhancement coeﬃcient:

The contribution of the 5g intermediate state is very small. We also estimate the contribution of the higher d-levels
(mainly the continuous spectrum) as

Altogether this gives the following value of the single particle contribution to the EDM enhancement coeﬃcient

III. MANY-BODY CORRECTIONS

In the situation with cesium or any other atom with valent s- or p-electrons [6] the single particle estimate is
satisfactory. However here we have f -electrons that have a very small wave function in the vicinity of the nucleus.
As a result the single particle contribution is strongly suppressed. Technically this suppression is reﬂected in eq. (8);
the matrix element is proportional to 1/γ3, and for f5/2-electrons γ ≈ 3, while for s1/2- or p1/2-electrons γ ≈ 0.88.
Therefore it is very important to estimate the many-body corrections. The leading many-body corrections to the EDM
enhancement coeﬃcient Kmb are shown in diagrams Fig.2, where the wavy line denotes residual Coulomb interaction

We have only included s − p1/2 matrix elements of V r

Like the parameters presented in (11) the energy levels and radial integrals in this formula have been calculated using
a Hartree-Fock method

E5s = −3.15 E5p = −2.26 E6s = −1.03 E6p = −0.84
F (2)(6p, 4f ; 5d, 5s) = −0.023.
F (2)(5p, 4f ; 5d, 6s) = 0.028

The corresponding eﬀective principal quantum numbers are ν5s = 1.59, ν5p = 1.88, ν6s = 2.78, ν6p = 3.09. Using
the E5d − E4f energy splitting given in (13) and (14) and substituting all the parameters into eq. (22), we ﬁnd the
many-body correction due to the 6s-, 6p-, and 5d- intermediate states, see Fig.2

One should also perform the summation over higher s-, p-, and d- intermediate states. We estimate this contribution
as

Combining (24) and (25) one ﬁnds the leading many-body correction to the enhancement coeﬃcient

It is substantially smaller than the single particle contribution (17), so the many-body perturbation theory is conver-
gent. The ﬁnal result for the electron EDM enhancement coeﬃcient, K = Ksp + Kmb, reads

(23)

(25)

(26)

(27)

A : Kmb1 ≈ −0.7,
B : Kmb1 ≈ −0.3.

A, B : Kmb2 ≈ −0.2

A : Kmb ≈ −0.9,
B : Kmb ≈ −0.5.

A : K ≈ −6.4,
B : K ≈ −3.3.

IV. CONCLUSION

We recall that the case A corresponds to the energy splitting (13), and the case B corresponds to (14).

We have calculated the electron EDM enhancement coeﬃcient in the Gd3+ ion. The single particle contribution
as well as the leading many-body corrections have been taken into account. The result is K ≈ −4.9 ± 1.6. The
main reason for such a large uncertainty lies in the unknown energy splitting E4f − E5d. Experimental and/or
theoretical determination of the splitting in Gd3+ would be the most important step for improving the accuracy of
the enhancement coeﬃcient calculation.

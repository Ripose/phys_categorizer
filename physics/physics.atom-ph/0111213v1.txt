We simultaneously trap ultracold lithium and cesium atoms in an optical dipole trap formed by the
focus of a CO2 laser and study the exchange of thermal energy between the gases. The cesium gas,
which is optically cooled to 20 µK, eﬃciently decreases the temperature of the lithium gas through
−12
sympathetic cooling. The measured cross section for thermalizing 133Cs-7Li collisions is 8 × 10
cm2, for both species in their lowest hyperﬁne ground state. Besides thermalization, we observe
evaporation of lithium purely through elastic cesium-lithium collisions (sympathetic evaporation).

It is particularly useful

Exchange of heat through thermal contact between two
ensembles is the most obvious and ubiquitous thermody-
namic process.
In the context of cold gases, this pro-
cess can be utilized to sympathetically cool one com-
if the
ponent in a mixture.
other component can be cooled eﬃciently in a direct
way, e.g. by optical methods. Sympathetic cooling has
been demonstrated with charged particles which ther-
malize through the long-range Coulomb interaction [1].
For neutral atoms and molecules one can use helium
gas as a cooling agent which can be cooled cryogeni-
cally to well below 1 K [2]. Only recently, sympathetic
cooling has been successfully extended to the ultracold
regime [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Quantum degeneracy of bosons and
fermions was obtained by thermalization between atoms
of the same species in diﬀerent internal states [3], be-
tween two isotopes of the same species [4, 5] and, as a
recent highlight, between atoms of diﬀerent species [7].
The degree of quantum degeneracy obtained in those ex-
periments was ﬁnally limited by two important loss pro-
cesses: exoergic collisions between magnetically trapped
atoms, and evaporation, which decreases the heat capac-
ity of the cooling agent.

In this Letter, we explore the thermodynamics of sym-
pathetic cooling for a mixture of two diﬀerent atomic
gases at ultralow temperatures. We present an intrin-
sically loss-free approach which can be generalized to a
vast range of atomic species and even molecules. Both
the coolant gas and the gas of interest are in their internal
energetic ground state, and conﬁned to the same volume
by the optical dipole force [8]. The coolant gas is cooled
by pure optical techniques [9] which can be applied in an
optical dipole trap without signiﬁcant loss.

Our model system is a mixture of cesium and lithium in
an extremely far-detuned optical dipole trap. Cesium is
an excellent cooling agent, since it can be optically cooled
to very low temperatures, mainly due to its high mass.
Lithium, on the other side, is diﬃcult to cool optically.
In addition, it is nearly an ideal gas due the very small
cross section for elastic Li-Li collisions [5]. Thermaliza-
tion thus occurs purely through collisions with the cesium
atoms. As a second important thermodynamic process

besides thermalization, we study evaporation through Li-
Cs collisions (sympathetic evaporation) in traps with ﬁ-
nite depth. Both processes allow an independent mea-
surement of the a priori unknown interspecies scattering
cross-section.

To trap a mixture of ultracold species, the focus of a
CO2 laser beam, at λ = 10.6 µm, constitutes an almost
perfect realization of a conservative trapping potential
(quasi-electrostatic trap, QUEST) [8, 10, 11, 12]. Atoms
and molecules can be stored in any internal state, es-
pecially the energetic ground state. For atoms in the
lowest-energy hyperﬁne state, energy-releasing processes
in two-body collisions cannot occur. Due to the large de-
tuning of the laser frequency from any atomic resonances,
heating through photon scattering can be completely ne-
glected.

Using a commercial sealed-tube laser, we obtain a
power of 108 W in the vacuum chamber, focused to
a waist w0 = 86 µm. For a Gaussian laser beam,
with power P and waist w0 the trap depth is given by
0), which yields U Cs
U0 = αstatP/(πε0cw2
0 /kB = 0.85 mK
and U Li
0 /kB = 0.34 mK. By measuring the oscillation
frequencies of Cs atoms in the trap, ωx,y/2π = 850 Hz
and ωz/2π = 18 Hz, we ﬁnd our trap is slightly deformed
axially, probably due to stable multimode operation of
the laser [13].

Atoms are transferred into the dipole trap from
magneto-optical traps (MOT) for lithium and cesium
which are superimposed on the focus of the CO2 laser
beam. Both MOTs are loaded from Zeeman-slowed
atomic beams. The lifetime of the gas is limited only
by rest-gas collisions to ≈ 100 s. Details of our appa-
ratus and of the procedure for loading atoms into the
QUEST are given in Refs. [12, 13].

Transferred separately, we obtain 5 × 105 Cs atoms in
the QUEST, which we cool by polarization gradient cool-
ing to 20 µK. We ﬁnd that the temperature is lower for a
shallower trap, while in free space we reach temperatures
below 3 µK. Apparently the Stark shifts caused by the
QUEST inﬂuence the cooling process in a way which is
not yet understood. The Cs is optically pumped into the
lowest hyperﬁne state (F = 3), and since we compen-

sate the magnetic ﬁeld, the atoms are distributed evenly
over the degenerate mF states. The peak density of Cs
atoms in the QUEST is ∼ 2 × 1011 cm−3. Since the
scattering length of the Cs is larger than the typical rela-
tive wavevector in collisions, the internal thermalization
of the Cs gas is dominated by the unitary maximum s-
wave scattering cross-section [14] σCsCs = 4π/k2, where
k is the relative wavevector. We use the expression for
distinguishable atoms since the majority of the collisions
are between atoms in diﬀerent mF states. The collision
rate is approximately 7 per second, and thermalization
through Cs-Cs collisions is estimated to take ∼ 2 sec-
onds [14].

The situation for Li is diﬀerent: since the temperature
reached in the MOT is higher than the trap depth, only
approximately 105 atoms are transferred. Numerical sim-
ulations indicate these atoms occupy a truncated thermal
distribution with an internal energy of ∼ 3kB × 75 µK,
which only very weakly depends on the MOT tempera-
ture. The lithium atoms are optically pumped into the
F = 1 hyperﬁne state, and in the absence of a magnetic
guiding ﬁeld distribute themselves over the degenerate
mF states. As the scattering length of Li in the F = 1
state is anomalously small [5], the distribution does not
thermalize on the 100 s timescale of our experiment.

In order to simultaneously trap the two species, a
Cs MOT is loaded and the atoms transferred into the
QUEST in optical molasses. Subsequently, a Li MOT is
loaded at a slightly diﬀerent position, to minimize light-
induced atom loss in a two-species MOT [15]. Once it
reaches the desired density, the Li MOT is compressed
and overlapped with the QUEST for a few ms to opti-
mize transfer of Li atoms. We can simultaneously trap
typically 4 × 104 Li atoms with up to 105 Cs.

After a variable interaction time in the QUEST, usu-
ally a few seconds, we analyze the gas sample. The
temperature and atom number of Cs are determined by
absorption imaging and time-of-ﬂight velocimetry [16].
However, the lithium gas in our trap is too dilute to use
absorption imaging. We determine the temperature of
the lithium gas using a release- recapture method. The
dipole trap potential is suddenly turned oﬀ for a variable
ballistic expansion time of order 1 ms. After this time,
the dipole trap is turned on again for ∼ 500 ms to re-
capture the atoms that are still close to the center of the
trap, while the others are lost. The number of remain-
ing atoms can then be measured by the ﬂuorescence of a
MOT.

Figure 1 shows two such release-recapture measure-
ments: one for a pure Li ensemble and one for a Li en-
semble that has been trapped simultaneously with cold
Cs. The pure Li gas is seen to be lost from the trap
in ∼ 0.4 ms, while the ensemble of Li that has been in
thermal contact with cold Cs (TCs = 28 µK initially) is
seen to contain many more slow atoms, which indicates
cooling. To quantitatively understand this cooling pro-

cess we compare the release-recapture measurements to
calculations.

For a gas at low temperature (kBT ≪ U0) in an ex-
tremely elongated Gaussian trap (ωax ≪ ωrad), we derive
an analytical approximation of the number of recaptured
atoms,

N0

Nr(t) =

1 − e−η (cid:2)1 − exp (cid:0)−ηW (˜t2)/˜t2(cid:1)(cid:3) .

(1)

Here w0 is the Gaussian beam waist, η = U0/kBT ,
˜t2 = mw2
0t2/4U0, and W (z) is the product logarithm
function, satisfying W (z) exp(W (z)) = z. The analytical
approximation of Eq. (1) agrees with numerical simula-
tion for temperatures up to kBT ∼ 0.15 U0. Full numer-
ical calculation of Nr(t) is possible for any T and shows
that for kBT > 0.2 U0 (75 mK for Li) the width of the
recapture curve becomes essentially independent of tem-
perature, i.e., release-recapture measurements no longer
provide reliable temperature data. Hence Eq. (1) can be
used over all of the useful parameter range of this ther-
mometry method. For the temperature range of interest,
we estimate the accuracy of this method to be better
than 20%.

The release-recapture curve of the pure Li in Fig. 1
can be reproduced by assuming a thermal distribution at
TLi = 71 ± 15 µK. The sympathetically cooled Li ensem-
ble is well-described by TLi = 30 ± 6 µK, which is equal
to the Cs temperature within the uncertainty margins,
indicating that the gases have fully thermalized.

We measure the thermalization time by making a se-
ries of temperature measurements for both components,
as seen in Fig. 2. The Cs and Li temperatures converge to
the same value ¯T = 33 µK to within 2%. The measured
atom numbers show that no signiﬁcant loss of either Li
or Cs occurs during thermalization. The thermalization

ture with energy independent cross-section, the average
energy transferred per collision is kB∆T ξ, where ∆T is
the temperature diﬀerence between the components, and
ξ = 4m1m2/(m1 +m2)2 is the reduction factor due to the
mass diﬀerence (ξ = 0.19 for a Li-Cs mixture). The heat
capacity of a harmonically trapped atomic gas is 3kB per
atom, leading to an average number of 3/ξ collisions per
Li atom (assuming NCs ≫ NLi) needed for thermaliza-
tion [13, 14, 17]. The thermalization rate is related to
the collision rate per Li atom γcoll by

From the measured thermalization rate we calculate
γcoll = 7(1) s−1.

Surprisingly, the Li atoms have as high a collision rate
with Cs as the Cs atoms themselves, even though the
Cs-Cs collisions have the maximum s-wave cross-section.
The explanation for this lies in the small unitary cross
section and the low thermal velocity for Cs, both a re-
sult of the high mass. The collision-enhancing eﬀects
of the low Li mass compensate the loss of thermaliza-
tion eﬃciency that is caused by the mass ratio factor ξ.
The inferred cross-section for Li-Cs collisions is σLiCs =
0.8(4) × 10−11 cm2, where the main limitation of the ac-
curacy is the determination of the absolute densities. As-
suming s-wave scattering dominates, we ﬁnd an s-wave
scattering length |aLiCs| = (σLiCs/4π)1/2 = 180+40
−50 a0.

This value is smaller than the inverse of the wavevector
k at thermal energies, but for superthermal collisions,
such as play a role in evaporation, one would have to
take into account the energy dependence of the s-wave
cross section [14]. For thermalizing collisions we estimate
only a minor inﬂuence in our case. Adequate theory for
thermalization and evaporation with energy-dependent
cross-sections is still lacking.

In a trap of ﬁnite depth, thermalizing collisions lead
to evaporation of particles, as atoms are scattered into
untrapped states in the high-energy tail of the thermal
distribution. This evaporation is practically absent in
two cases: if the temperature is much lower than the trap
depth (as is the case for pure Cs samples in our trap) or
if the collision rate is extremely small (as is the case for
pure Li samples in our trap). The thermalizing Li-Cs
collisions enable, besides cooling, evaporation of the Li
from the trap. The Li evaporates even under conditions
where the Cs evaporation is negligible for two reasons:
The Li trap depth is smaller and the collision rate for
Li atoms exceeds that for Cs atoms. Remarkably, since
a Li atom needs energy to evaporate from the trap, this
sympathetic evaporation of the Li represents transfer of
thermal energy from a cold (Cs) to a hot (Li) ensemble.
The evaporation probability per collision in an ensem-
ble where the Cs and Li are thermalized is, assuming
energy-independent cross-sections, Pevap ∼ η exp(−η),
where η = U Li
0 /kBT [13]. In numerical simulations for
the relevant mass ratio and η we ﬁnd an atom loss rate

γevap ≃ 0.5 ηe

−ηγcoll.

(3)

In particular, the simulations conﬁrm that Pevap is al-
most independent of the mass ratio as long as η > 2/ξ.
In Fig. 3 the evolution of the number of trapped Li atoms
in thermal contact with Cs is shown for diﬀerent temper-
atures. The inset shows γevap as a function of tempera-
ture. We ﬁt the model of Eq. (3) to the data, with γcoll as
the only free parameter, and obtain a ﬁt at γcoll ∼ 50 s−1,
which results in an eﬀective cross-section for evaporation
of about 5 × 10−11 cm2, with an estimated uncertainty of
about a factor 3. This is of the same order of magnitude
as the thermalization cross-section, but contributions due
to energy-dependence of the cross-section (e.g., the onset
of p-wave scattering) cannot be excluded.

Sympathetic evaporation poses a limit to thermaliza-
tion in shallow traps: a considerable fraction of the atoms
is lost during the ﬁrst thermalization time for traps with
U0/kB ¯T < W (3/ξ) ( ¯T is the average temperature, W
is the product logarithm function). For the Li-Cs mass
ratio, thermalization without signiﬁcant loss is possible
if η > 4.
In the initial few collisions, the Li distribu-
tion is far from thermal equilibrium with the Cs, and the
evaporation loss cannot be estimated analytically. In nu-
merical simulations we see a small loss of Li atoms in the
initial few collisions, which is < 10% if TCs/U Li
0 < 0.1,

The usefulness of

cooling depends
strongly on the timescale of thermalization. To reach
the quantum degenerate regime in our trap geometry,
the temperature of the Li gas must be decreased by two
orders of magnitude from the initial temperature after
loading, which takes ∼ 5 thermalization times, assuming
the Cs is optically cooled to be always much below the
Li temperature. This means only an average number of
∼ 50 Li-Cs collisions are needed for sympathetic cool-
ing, compared with more than 1000 Li-Li collisions for
evaporative cooling of Li to BEC.

The heat which the Li transfers to the Cs can be re-
moved by repeated pulsed optical cooling. This is more
eﬃcient than continuous cooling since the light-induced
inelastic collisions can act only during the short (20 ms)
cooling pulses, while thermalization continues over longer
time. In this way, we have been able to reach Li temper-
atures down to 25 µK. The main limitation for reaching
lower temperatures is the base temperature of the Cs
polarization-gradient cooling, which appears to be lim-
ited by the trapping potential and the high Cs density.
Diﬀerent optical cooling schemes, or operation at lower
Cs density, may provide lower Cs temperatures and ulti-
mately an evaporation-free route to quantum degeneracy
of both the fermionic and bosonic lithium isotopes.

4

Another intriguing aspect of the Li-Cs mixture is the
formation of cold heteronuclear molecules. By loss-free
sympathetic cooling, we reach densities of 2 × 1010 cm−3
and 2 × 1011 cm−3 for lithium and cesium, respectively,
which provide good starting conditions for photoasso-
ciation experiments [18]. Once the cold molecules are
formed they may be stored in the quasi-electrostatic trap
together with the atomic gases as a ﬁrst step towards cold
quantum chemistry. In addition, the large electric dipole
moment of the LiCs dimer can be used to manipulate
and control internal and external degrees of freedom of
the molecules.

We develop a theoretical treatment of polarization spectroscopy and use it to generate model spectra for the
D2 transitions in 87Rb, 85Rb, and 133Cs. Experiments demonstrate that the model accurately reproduces spectra
of transitions from the upper hyperﬁne level of the ground state, but not of transitions from the lower hyperﬁne
′ = F + 1 dominates, with a steep gradient
level. For the upper hyperﬁne spectra, the closed transition F → F
through line center ideally suited for use as a reference in laser locking.

INTRODUCTION

Polarization spectroscopy is a sub-Doppler spectroscopic
technique in which birefringence is induced in a medium by a
circularly polarized pump beam, and interrogated with a coun-
terpropagating weak probe beam [1, 2, 3]. It is closely related
to saturation spectroscopy, and has proved a useful tool in ar-
eas as diverse as combustion diagnostics [4], plasma charac-
terization [5], and laser frequency stabilization [6, 7, 8].

In this work we develop a simple theoretical model of polar-
ization spectroscopy based on a calculation of rate equations.
Using this model, we generate spectra for the hyperﬁne tran-
sitions of the D2 lines of rubidium and cesium, and show that
for transitions from the upper hyperﬁne level of the ground
state (n2S1/2(F =
1,
where
is the nuclear spin) our model gives good agreement
with the observed spectra. For transitions from the lower hy-
perﬁne level, the model breaks down, demonstrating that fac-
tors not included in the model play a signiﬁcant role.

The layout of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we de-
rive expressions needed to construct our model and discuss
how spectra are produced. Section 3 describes the experimen-
tal apparatus used to test the model’s predictions in rubidium
and cesium, and section 4 contains experimental and theoret-
ical spectra for all six D2 transitions. Section 5 contains a
discussion of our results, and in section 6 we draw our con-
clusions.

II. THEORY

A. Optical Bloch and population change equations

The density matrix is used to calculate the atom-light in-
teraction. Consider a two level atom with ground state a,
excited state b, and transition angular frequency ω0, inter-
acting with laser light of angular frequency ωL and detuning
ω0. The Optical Bloch equations are [9]

Here ρaa and ρbb are the ground and excited state proba-
bilities, respectively, and the off-diagonal terms ˜ρab and ˜ρba
are coherences. (The tilde notation means that we are using
“slow” variables - i.e.
the evolution of the coherence at the
laser frequency has been factored out separately). The Rabi
frequency is denoted by ΩR and is proportional to the prod-
uct of the electric ﬁeld of the laser and the transition matrix
element. The effect of spontaneous emission is to reduce the
excited state population at a rate Γ = 1/τ , and the coher-
ences at a rate Γ/2, where τ is the excited state lifetime [9].
There are no collisional terms as the mean time between col-
lisions in the room temperature vapor cells used in these ex-
periments is far longer than the mean time spent in the laser
beams. Similar equations are derived for many-level atoms
for every Zeeman sub-state. It becomes much easier to solve
these equations by eliminating the coherences. To this end, it
is assumed that the coherences evolve sufﬁciently quickly that
their steady state value can be used. For example, by setting
the time derivatives to zero in the second and third equations
in (1) and substituting into the ﬁrst equation we obtain

This leaves rate equations for populations only. Recall-
ing that the light intensity I is proportional to the square of
the Rabi frequency, the saturation intensity Isat is deﬁned as
R/Γ2. The three terms on the right-hand side
I/Isat = 2Ω2
of (2) have the usual physical interpretation: the ﬁrst repre-
sents stimulated emission out of the excited state, proportional
to the light intensity; the second absorption into the excited

state, proportional to the light intensity; and the third sponta-
neous emission out of the excited state, which is independent
of the light intensity. The intensity-dependent terms have a
Lorentzian line-shape, with full width at half maximum of Γ.
Note that the usual rate equations of laser physics for popu-
lations with Einstein A and B coefﬁcients assume broad-band
radiation, and use the intensity per bandwidth (evaluated at
line center); in contrast, equation (2) is valid for narrow-band
radiation and is a function of the detuning.

±

It is easy to generalize these equations for multilevel sys-
tems. Each excited state can decay into up to nine different
ground states (three possible polarizations, and the ∆F =
1 selection rule). The pump beam drives σ+ transitions,
0,
and the Rabi frequencies and saturation intensities are calcu-
lated from the known line-strength coefﬁcients. There are 36,
24, or 48 Zeeman levels which have to be considered for the
85Rb, 87Rb, or 133Cs systems, respectively; hence the sim-
pliﬁcation of the equations by eliminating the coherences is
substantial. It is not immediately obvious, however, whether
this elimination is valid. This was studied by numerically
solving the optical Bloch equations containing the coherences
and the rate equations for a few sample systems. For a short
time the solutions differ - the rate equations are linear in time
whereas the optical Bloch equations give a quadratic time de-
pendence for the evolution of populations. However, the solu-
tions become indistinguishable after a time of
7τ [10]. As
the typical time of ﬂight of an atom through the laser beams
(discussed below) is roughly two orders of magnitude longer
10−6 s) it is an excellent approximation to solve the
(
≃
equations for the rate of change of populations.

B. Calculation of anisotropy

The birefringence of the medium can be probed by a lin-
early polarized probe beam, which can be decomposed into
two beams of equal amplitude and opposite circular polariza-
tion. For an isotropic medium, both circular components ex-
perience the same refractive index and absorption. There is
a difference in absorption coefﬁcients, ∆α, for the optically
α−, with α± being the ab-
pumped medium: ∆α = α+ −
sorption coefﬁcients of the circular components driving σ±
transitions. Correspondingly, the incident linearly polarized
beam exits the medium with a rotated elliptical polarization.
Both the ellipticity and the angle of rotation are proportional
to ∆α [6]. In our experimental set-up (Section 3) we are sen-
sitive to the rotation of polarization, providing the absorption
coefﬁcients are not too large. The signal has a characteristic
dispersion spectrum (equation (9) in [6]). Therefore for each
resonance we calculate one parameter, the line-center differ-
ence in absorption.

The experiments were performed with alkali metal atoms
(85Rb, 87Rb, 133Cs) on the D2 transition. For an atom in the
2S1/2 ground state with nuclear spin
there are two values

for 87Rb, 9.2 GHz for 133Cs) exceeds the room temperature
Doppler width (
0.5 GHz), whereas the excited state hyper-
ﬁne splitting is less than the Doppler width. Therefore, the
absorption spectrum consists of two isolated Doppler broad-
ened absorption lines per isotope. Sub-Doppler absorption
features are obtained by using counter-propagating pump and
probe beams. There are three excited state resonances coupled
to each ground state via electric dipole transitions, namely
1). In addition, one
S1/2(F )
observes three cross-over resonances at frequencies halfway
between each pair of conventional resonances [11].

The calculation assumes that there is no excited state popu-
lation initially, and that the ground state population is spread
uniformly amongst the 2(2
levels.
The pump beam has intensity I and drives σ+ transitions.
This optical pumping process drives the population towards
the largest possible value of mF , and the medium becomes
anisotropic. Equations similar to (2) are written down for each
mF level, and the set of coupled equations are solved numer-
ically.

1). The selection rules forbid atoms in the excited state
F
from falling into the other ground state; consequently, all of
the ground state population ends up pumped into the extreme
magnetic sublevels with mF = F (for
+ 1/2) or mF = F
and mF = F
1/2). Figure 1 illustrates the op-
1 (for
tical pumping process. The absorption coefﬁcients α± differ
most for this extreme state; therefore, the anisotropy of the
medium is maximized. For other transitions there is the pos-
sibility of falling into the other ground state, where they are
too far (a few GHz) from resonance with the probe beams
to cause a rotation of polarization. Note that the sign of the
anisotropy generated by the
+ 1/2 transitions is expected to
be opposite that of the lower hyperﬁne transitions, due to the
lack of allowed σ+ transitions from the high-mF states when
F =

1/2.

I

After solving the coupled population rate equations it is
possible to calculate the time-dependent anisotropy of the
medium,
(t). This is deﬁned as a sum over all of the ground
mF states of the difference in the absorption coefﬁcients for
the components of the probe beam driving σ± transitions, tak-
ing into account the ground and excited state populations:

D. Generating theoretical spectra

To generate the predicted spectra, the three values of
A
from (7) are multiplied by dispersion functions of the form
x/(1 + x2), where x = 2∆/Γ. As in the work of Yoshikawa
et al. [12] the strength of cross-over features is assumed to
be the average of the two associated resonances; hence cross-
over features are calculated by multiplying this average by a
dispersion function located halfway between each resonance.
To account for spectral broadening produced by satura-
tion effects (power broadening), we substitute a broadened
linewidth γ
2π MHz for the natural linewidth Γ in the
dispersion function. Doppler broadening is incorporated by
convolving the resulting spectra with a Gaussian of FWHM
2π MHz, consistent with residual Doppler broadening
≤
due to the ﬁnite crossing angle between the probe and pump
beams. Magnitudes for both types of broadening were set by
the experimental conditions, as were the values for tempera-
ture, beam radii, and I/Isat.

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The layout of our experiment is similar to that described in
[6] and is shown in Figure 2. The probe beam’s plane of polar-
ization is set at π/4 with respect to a polarizing beam splitter
(PBS), which acts as an analyzer. The signal we record is the
difference between the signals in each arm of the PBS; in the
absence of a pump beam, the two arms will have equal intensi-
ties, and the difference will be zero. This technique produces
polarization signals an order of magnitude larger than the con-
ventional (single detector) method - an important advantage if
the signal is being used for laser locking [6].

The experimental layouts for rubidium and cesium spec-
troscopy are very similar, differing only in the length of the
alkali vapor cell, equipment used to control magnetic ﬁeld
along the axis of the cell, and waveplate type. Table 1 con-
tains information on the spot radii (1/e2 intensities) of the

FIG. 2: Experimental layout. A thick glass slide picks off a fraction
of the extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) light and splits it into
two parallel beams. One beam acts as the probe, and the other as a
(nearly) counterpropagating pump. The beams overlap inside a 70
mm (50 mm) Rb (Cs) cell, which rests inside a long solenoid and
below an earth canceling coil. In the cesium experiment two coils in
the Helmholtz conﬁguration replace the solenoid. A half-wave plate
rotates the plane of polarization of the probe beam with respect to the
polarizing beam splitter (PBS) cube axis; a quarter-wave plate makes
the pump circularly polarized.

±

In both experiments the pump and probe beams are de-
rived from the same extended cavity diode laser (ECDL).
The diode for the rubidium (cesium) laser was a Sanyo DL-
7140-201 (Sharp SDL-5401-G1). The crossing angle between
probe and counterpropagating pump within the vapour cell is
0.2 mrad. Neutral density ﬁlters are used to vary pump
<3.0
and probe powers independently. A half-wave plate rotates
the polarization of the probe relative to the axis of the PBS; a
quarter-wave plate converts light in the pump beam to circular
polarization. The two output beams from the PBS are focused
onto photodiodes, which are connected to simple current-to-
voltage circuits designed to output a voltage linearly propor-
tional to the incident intensity. These voltages are then sub-
tracted electronically to yield the polarization spectra.

Since light of a given polarization may drive σ+, σ− or
π transitions depending on the external magnetic ﬁeld, it is
necessary to establish a “preferred” magnetic ﬁeld direction
along the vapor cell axis. In the rubidium experiment this is
done by placing a room-temperature cell containing 85Rb and
87Rb inside a 300-turn solenoid of length 280 mm and diam-
eter 26 mm. The magnetic ﬁeld inside the solenoid is uniform
to within 0.2% over the length of the 70 mm cell. In the ce-
sium experiment the cell is partially submerged in an ice bath,

4

×

and two 300
300 mm square coils in the Helmholtz conﬁg-
uration generate an axial magnetic ﬁeld uniform to 1%. The
ice bath is needed because our model assumes an optically
thin medium, but at 23 ◦C absorption exceeds 90% for a 50
mm Cs vapor cell (compared to a maximum of 30% for Rb in
a 70 mm cell). In the ice bath this is reduced to 60% (50%)
for transitions from the upper (lower) hyperﬁne level of the
ground state. In both experiments we also cancel the (primar-
ily vertical) ambient laboratory magnetic ﬁeld with a 245 mm
diameter coil mounted above the cell. The magnitude of the
axial ﬁeld is set to a value just below the point where Zeeman
splitting of the hyperﬁne levels begins to distort the polariza-
tion spectra, typically

150 µT.

Figure 3 shows the data obtained with the layout described
in the last section (thick line) and the theoretical spectra (thin
line). All experimental spectra were taken with pump and
probe beam intensities

fects. The left-hand column contains spectra of transitions
from the upper hyperﬁne level of the ground state, i.e.

in 85Rb, and 6 2S1/2 (F = 4)
transitions in 133Cs. The closed transitions in this group are
the well-known “cooling” transition used in laser-cooling ex-
periments. The right column shows polarization spectra of
transitions from the lower hyperﬁne level, with the highest-
frequency peaks representing “repump” transitions. Zero de-
tuning is relative to the highest-frequency transition, and all
detunings are given in units of ∆/2π. The magnitude of each
feature is given in volts, and will depend on the gain resistance
in the photodiode circuit (1 MΩ in our experiment). For the
upper hyperﬁne transitions in Cs, two sets of data are shown;
one taken with the vapor cell at room temperature (dashed
line), the other with the cell in an ice bath as described in the
previous section (solid line).

→

In the upper hyperﬁne spectra, polarization signals of
closed transitions dominate, with magnitudes up to three times
that of the next largest feature. This is true for all three
species, and is in marked contrast with conventional saturated
absorption/hyperﬁne pumping spectra [13]. For the lower hy-
perﬁne spectra, the pattern is more complicated. The (low-
frequency) closed transitions in Cs and 85Rb show a charac-
teristic strong dispersion feature, but in 87Rb the largest fea-
ture arises from one of the cross-over peaks. In 85Rb closely-
spaced transitions generate a polarization spectrum in which
individual peaks merge, making exact matching of features
and transitions difﬁcult.

V. DISCUSSION

By comparing theoretical and experimental traces, we see
immediately that for upper hyperﬁne transitions, our model

closely-spaced F = 2
in 87Rb arise automatically from the calculated anisotropies.
The magnitudes of theoretical spectral peaks relative to the
largest (closed transition) peak also agree well with experi-

→

mental data, especially in 85Rb. The effect of reducing vapor
pressure by cooling the Cs cell is readily apparent. Although
the central peaks are still offset from theoretical spectra com-
pared to their counterparts in the Rb spectra, the magnitude of
the offset is signiﬁcantly less at 0 ◦C than at room tempera-
ture, and the shapes of the spectra broadly agree.

By contrast, observed lower hyperﬁne spectra (right col-
umn in Fig. 3) differ markedly from predictions. Although
some features - particularly the dispersive shape and relative
magnitudes of the outermost Cs transition peaks - resemble
theoretical predictions, others clearly do not. Crucially, how-
ever, the model spectra show similar discrepancies for each of
the three species, indicating that the lack of agreement must
be due to physical processes not included in our model.

To gain insight into the anisotropies induced by lower hy-
perﬁne transitions, we performed experiments designed to
measure the anisotropy directly. As in Reference [6], a
quarter-wave plate was inserted before the PBS, oriented such
that it converted the circular polarization component of the
probe which drives σ+ (σ−) transitions into vertically (hor-
izontally) polarized light. The output from the arms of the
PBS then directly measures the absorption experienced by the
components driving σ+ and σ− transitions.

For upper hyperﬁne transitions, the largest anisotropies (i.e.
largest difference in signal between the two arms) resulted
from the closed transitions. This agrees with theoretical pre-
dictions and is reﬂected in our data. For lower hyperﬁne tran-
sitions, large and strongly negative anisotropies occurred at
the cross-over frequencies - a fact reﬂected in our data, but
not in the model. This suggests that for such transitions, it is
no longer valid to assume that the strength of crossover fea-
tures is the average of the two associated resonances.

The present model assumes a uniformly distributed circular
laser beam. The experimental beam has a Gaussian proﬁle,
which will lead to slight variations in the absolute height of
the spectroscopic peaks. It will not, however, account for the
difference between upper and lower hyperﬁne transitions. The
most signiﬁcant approximation that is likely to break down for
lower hyperﬁne transitions is the assumption that only atoms
with no axial velocity will contribute to the anisotropy. As was
shown in [13], a full description of the spectrum, especially
open transitions, must take into account a large velocity class
of atoms moving along the beam, not just the “stationary”
ones. The contribution of these nonzero velocity classes will
1/2 because the line strength
be more signiﬁcant for F =
factors for the closed transition are weakest; for F =
+ 1/2,
line strength factors are strongest for the closed transition, and
the “stationary atom” approximation is reasonable.

Expanding the model to include a large velocity class would
be computationally intense, and is beyond the scope of this
work. Walewski et al. have performed numerical simula-
tions which included nonzero axial velocities, and success-
fully used their model to explain features of polarization spec-

6

tra in ﬂames [14]. However, the organic molecules they stud-
ied have very different structures and properties from those of
the alkali atoms examined here, and adapting their model to
account for alkali spectra would be correspondingly nontriv-
ial.

In comparing theoretical predictions with experimental sig-
nals, we have chieﬂy focused on the shape and relative magni-
tudes of spectral features. The absolute magnitude of the ex-
perimental polarization spectroscopy signal depends not only
on the gain resistor in the photodiode circuit, as discussed in
the previous section, but also on the intensity of the probe
beam in the absence of a vapor cell (see Eq. 7 in reference
[6]). This in turn depends on the optical thickness of the va-
por, which is both temperature-dependent (as noted earlier in
our discussion of cesium) and different for each species. Be-
cause of these factors, the species with the largest calculated
anisotropy will not necessarily produce the largest experimen-
tal signal. Our decision to display theoretical and experimen-
tal spectra on separate scales reﬂects these considerations.

Finally, we note that although the peaks associated with the
closed transitions in the upper hyperﬁne spectra are ideal for
laser locking, with steep slopes centered on line center, this is
not true for the lower hyperﬁne spectra, where the position of
each zero crossing is not trivially related to the position of the
resonances.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have experimentally studied polarization spectroscopy
for the D2 transitions in 87Rb, 85Rb, and 133Cs. We have pre-
sented a model of polarization spectroscopy based on numer-
ical integration of population rate equations which accounts
F ′ transitions, but not as well

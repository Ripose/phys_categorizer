Absolute dielectronic recombination (DR) rates for lithium-
like Ni25+(1s22s) ions were measured at high-energy resolu-
tion at the Heidelberg heavy-ion storage ring TSR. We stud-
ied the center-of-mass energy range 0–130 eV which covers
all ∆n=0 core excitations. The inﬂuence of external crossed
electric (0–300 V/cm) and magnetic (41.8–80.1 mT) ﬁelds was
investigated. For the measurement at near-zero electric ﬁeld
resonance energies and strengths are given for Rydberg lev-
els up to n=32; also Maxwellian plasma rate coeﬃcients for
the ∆n=0 DR at electron temperatures between 0.5 and 200
eV are provided. For increasing electric ﬁeld strength we ﬁnd
that for both the 2p1/2 and the 2p3/2 series of Ni24+(1s22pjnℓ)
Rydberg resonances with n > 30 the DR rate coeﬃcient in-
creases approximately linearly by up to a factor of 1.5. The
relative increase due to the applied electric ﬁeld for Ni25+ is
remarkably lower than that found in previous measurements
with lighter isoelectronic Si11+, Cl14+ and also Ti19+ ions,
[T. Bartsch et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 2233 (1997); 82, 3779
(1999) and to be published] and in contrast to the results for
lighter ions no clear dependence of the electric ﬁeld enhance-
ment on the magnetic ﬁeld strength is found. The Maxwellian
plasma rate coeﬃcients for ∆n=0 DR of Ni25+ are enhanced
by at most 11% in the presence of the strongest experimen-
tally applied ﬁelds.

I. INTRODUCTION

Dielectronic recombination (DR) is an electron-ion col-
lision process which is well known to be important in as-
trophysical and fusion plasmas [1,2]. In DR the initially
free electron is transferred to a bound state of the ion via
a doubly excited intermediate state which is formed by
an excitation of the core and a simultaneous attachment
of the incident electron. This two step process

e− + Aq+ → [A(q−1)+]∗∗ → A(q−1)+ + hν

(1)

involves dielectronic capture (time-inverse Auger pro-
cess) as the ﬁrst step with a subsequent stabilization of

the lowered charge state by radiative decay to a state be-
low the ionization limit. This second step competes with
autoionization which would transfer the ion back into its
initial charge state q with the net eﬀect being resonant
elastic or inelastic electron scattering. Another recombi-
nation process, which in contrast to DR is non-resonant,
is radiative recombination (RR)

e− + Aq+ → A(q−1)+ + hν

(2)

where the initially free electron is transferred to a bound
state of the ion and a photon is emitted simultaneously.
The cross section for RR diverges at zero electron en-
ergy and decreases rapidly towards higher energies. In
the present investigation we regard RR as a continuous
background on top of which DR resonances are emerging.
In the case of narrow non-overlapping DR resonances
the DR cross section due to an intermediate state labelled
d can be well approximated by [3]

σd(Ecm) = ¯σdLd(Ecm)

where Ed is the resonance energy, gi and gd are the sta-

excited intermediate state d, Aa(d → i) and Ar(d → f )
denote the rate for an autoionizing transition from d to
i and the rate for a radiative transition from d to states
f below the ﬁrst ionization limit, respectively. The sum-
mation indices k and f ′ run over all states which from d
can either be reached by autoionization or by radiative
transitions, respectively.

Soon after the establishment of DR as an important
process governing the charge state balance of ions in the
solar corona [4], Burgess and Summers [5] and Jacobs
et al. [6] realized that DR cross sections should be sen-
sitive to external electric ﬁelds present in virtually any

1

plasma environment. The electric ﬁeld enhancement of
DR rates was subsequently reproduced in a number of
theoretical calculations [7]. Brieﬂy, the eﬀect arises from
the Stark mixing of ℓ states and the resulting inﬂuence on
the autoionization rates which, by detailed balancing, de-
termine the capture of the free electron. Autoionization
rates strongly decrease with increasing ℓ and, therefore,
only low ℓ states signiﬁcantly contribute to DR. Electric
ﬁelds mix low and high ℓ states and thereby increase the
autoionization rates of the high ℓ states and consequently
also the contribution of high Rydberg states to DR.

The control of external ﬁelds in experiments using in-
tense ion and electron beams is a challenge. Results
from early recombination experiments [8,9] could only be
brought in agreement with theory under the assumption
that external electric ﬁelds had been present in the inter-
action region. The ﬁrst experiment where external ﬁelds
were applied under well controlled conditions was per-
formed by M¨uller and coworkers [10] who investigated
DR in the presence of external ﬁelds (DRF) of singly
charged Mg+ ions. They observed an increase of the
measured DR cross section by a factor of about 1.5 when
increasing the motional ~v × ~B electric ﬁeld from 7.2 to
23.5 V/cm. The agreement of these results with theo-
retical predictions [11,12] was at the 20% level. Further
DRF experiments with multiply charged C3+ ions also
revealed drastic DR rate enhancements by electric ﬁelds
[13]; however, the large uncertainties of these measure-
ments left ambiguities.

The ﬁrst DRF experiment using highly charged ions at
a storage ring was carried out with Si11+ ions by Bartsch
et al. [14].
It produced results with an unprecedented
accuracy, enabling a detailed comparison with theory.
Whereas the overall agreement between experiment and
theory for the magnitude of the eﬀect (up to a factor of 3
when increasing the ﬁeld from 0 V/cm to 183 V/cm)
was fair, discrepancies remained in the functional de-
pendence of the rate enhancement on the electric ﬁeld
strength. This ﬁnding stimulated theoretical investiga-
tions of the role of the additional magnetic ﬁeld which is
always present in storage ring DR experiments, since it is
needed to guide and conﬁne the electron beam within the
electron cooler. In a model calculation Robicheaux and
Pindzola [15] found that in a conﬁguration of crossed ~E
and ~B ﬁelds indeed the magnetic ﬁeld inﬂuences through
the mixing of m levels the rate enhancement generated
by the electric ﬁeld. More detailed calculations [16,17]
conﬁrmed these results. It should be noted that in theo-
retical calculations by Huber and Bottcher [18] no inﬂu-
ence of a pure magnetic ﬁeld of at least up to 5 T on DR
was found.

Inspired by these predictions we previously performed
storage ring DRF experiments using Li-like Cl14+ [19]
and Ti19+ [20] ions and crossed ~E and ~B ﬁelds where
we clearly discovered a distinct eﬀect of the magnetic
ﬁeld strength on the magnitude of the DR rate enhance-
ment. The electric ﬁeld eﬀect decreased monotonically

with the ~B ﬁeld increasing from 30 mT to 80 mT. A
decrease of the electric ﬁeld enhancement by a crossed
magnetic ﬁeld is also predicted by the model calculation
of Robicheaux and Pindzola [15] for magnetic ﬁelds larger
than approximately 20 mT where, due to a dominance
of the magnetic over the electric interaction energy, the
ℓ-mixing weakens and consequently the number of states
participating in DR decreases. At lower magnetic ﬁelds
m-mixing yields an increase of the DR rate with increas-
ing ~B ﬁeld. A corresponding experimental observation
has been made recently by Klimenko and coworkers [21]
who studied recombination of Ba+ ions from a continuum
of ﬁnite bandwidth which they had prepared by laser ex-
citation of neutral Ba atoms. For a given electric ﬁeld
strength of 0.5 V/cm, they ﬁnd that the recombination
rate is increasingly enhanced by crossed magnetic ﬁelds
up to about 20 mT. However, there is no eﬀect of the
magnetic ﬁeld when it is directed parallel to the electric
ﬁeld vector. For the m-mixing to occur the crossed ~E
and ~B arrangement is essential. In the case of parallel ~B
and ~E ﬁelds m remains a good quantum number and no
inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld is expected.

The aim of the present investigation with Li-like Ni25+
is to extend the previous studies to an ion with even
higher nuclear charge Z. Because of the Z 4 scaling of
radiative rates it is expected that with higher Z less ℓ
states of a given Rydberg n level take part in DR and
therefore the sensitivity to ℓ-mixing decreases [10]. Re-
sults of Griﬃn and Pindzola [22] who calculated decreas-
ing DR rate enhancements for increasing charge states
of iron ions point into the same direction. Another as-
pect of going to higher Z is that even high lying 2pjnℓ
Rydberg resonances are more separated in energy and
therefore easier to resolve. This has been demonstrated
by Brandau et al. who resolved 2p1/2nℓ DR resonances
up to n = 41 in the recombination spectrum of Li-like
Au76+ ions [23]. When choosing Ni25+ we hoped to be
able to study the ﬁeld enhancement eﬀect on a single
2pjnℓ resonance. This would enable a quantitative com-
parison with theory which at present is limited to a single
low value of n [16] when explicitly treating all nℓm levels
required for a realistic description of DR in crossed ~E
and ~B ﬁelds.

In our DRF studies we have chosen Li-like ions as test
systems since on the one hand their electronic structure is
simple enough to be treated theoretically on a high level
of sophistication and on the other hand provides strong
DR channels connected to the 2s → 2pj core excitations.

II. EXPERIMENT

The measurements have been performed at the heavy
ion storage ring TSR [24] of the Max-Planck-Institut
f¨ur Kernphysik in Heidelberg. For a general account of
experimental techniques at heavy ion storage rings the
reader is referred to an article by M¨uller and Wolf [25].

2

Recombination measurements at storage rings have been
reviewed recently by M¨uller [26], Schippers [27] and Wolf
et al. [28]. Detailed descriptions of the experimental pro-
cedure for ﬁeld free DR measurements have been given
by Kilgus et al. [29] and more recently by Lampert et
al. [30]. Therefore, we here only describe more explicitly
experimental aspects pertaining especially to the present
investigation.

The 58Ni25+ ion beam was supplied by the MPI tan-
dem booster facility and injected into the TSR with an
energy of 343 MeV. Using multiturn injection and e-cool
stacking [31] ion currents of up to 3300 µA were stored
in the TSR. At these high ion currents, however, intra
beam scattering heated the ion beam during DR mea-
surements resulting in a considerable loss of energy res-
olution. To avoid this and to limit the recombination
count rate to below 1 MHz, i. e. to below a count rate
where dead time eﬀects are still negligible, we kept ion
currents below 1 mA during all DR measurements. In
the storage ring the circulating Ni25+ ions were merged
with the magnetically guided electron beam of the elec-
tron cooler. In the present experiment the electron den-
sity was 5.4 × 106 cm−3 at cooling energy. Generally
the electron density varies with the cathode voltage Uc
thereby following a U 3/2
dependence. The distribution
of collision velocities in the electron-ion center of mass
frame can be described by the anisotropic Maxwellian

characterized by the longitudinal and transverse temper-
atures T|| and T⊥. In Eq. (5) me is the electron mass,
kB is the Boltzmann constant, and vrel
is the detun-
ing of the average longitudinal electron velocity from
that at cooling, which determines the relative energy
Erel ≈ mev2
rel/2 between the electron and the ion beam.
The longitudinal temperature, inferred from the experi-
mental resolution for relative energies Erel ≫ kBT⊥, was
kBT|| ≈ 0.25 meV. It implies an energy resolution given
by ∆E(FWHM)= 4pln(2)kBT||Erel [29]. The longitudi-
nal velocity spread of the stored ion beam yields a consid-
erable contribution to this temperature, while the veloc-
ity spread of the electron beam alone, after acceleration,
is estimated to be < 0.1 meV. In the transverse direction
the electron beam was adiabatically expanded [32] from
a diameter dc ≈ 9.5 mm at the cathode to a diameter
de = 29.5 mm in the interaction region; the reduction
of its transverse velocity spread by this expansion de-
termines the low value of the transverse temperature of
kBT⊥ ≈ 10 meV.
Before starting a measurement, the ion beam was
cooled for 5 seconds until the beam proﬁles reached their
equilibrium widths. This can be monitored online by
employing beam proﬁle monitors based on residual gas

3

ionization [33]. The cooled ion beam had a diameter
di ≈ 2 mm. During the measurement the electron cooler
voltage was stepped through a preset range of values dif-
ferent from the cooling voltage, thus introducing non-zero
mean relative velocities between ions and electrons. Re-
combined Ni24+ ions were counted as a function of the
cooler voltage with a CsI-scintillation detector [34] lo-
cated behind the ﬁrst dipole magnet downstream of the
electron cooler. The dipole magnet bends the circulat-
ing Ni25+ ion beam onto a closed orbit and separates the
recombined Ni24+ ions from that orbit.

Two diﬀerent measurement schemes were applied for
the measurement of i) a high resolution ‘ﬁeld-free’ DR
spectrum (residual stray electric ﬁelds ≤ 5 V/cm) and ii)
DRF spectra with motional electric ﬁelds ranging up to
300 V/cm. In view of the result of Huber and Bottcher
[18] who calculated that purely magnetic ﬁelds below 5 T
do not inﬂuence DR, the use of the term ‘ﬁeld-free’ seems
justiﬁed in case i) even with the magnetic guiding ﬁeld
(up to 80 mT) still present in the electron cooler.

A. Procedure for a ﬁeld free high resolution

measurement

In between two measurement steps for diﬀerent values
of Erel the cooler voltage was ﬁrst set back to the cooling
value in order to maintain the ion beam quality and then
set to a reference value which is chosen to lead to a rela-
tive velocity where the electron-ion recombination signal
is very small, favourably being only due to a negligible
RR contribution (reference relative energy Eref ). Under
this condition the recombination rate measured at the
reference point monitors the background signal due to
electron capture from residual gas molecules. Choosing
short time intervals of the order of only 10 ms for dwelling
on the measurement, cooling and reference voltages en-
sured that the experimental environment did not change
signiﬁcantly between the signal and the background mea-
surements. An additional interval of 1.5 ms after each
change of the cooler voltage allowed the power supplies
to reach the preset values before data taking was started.

The electron-ion recombination coeﬃcient

α(Erel) =Z d3~v σ(v)vf (~v, vrel)

(6)

is obtained from the background corrected recombination
count rate R(Erel) − R(Eref ), the detection eﬃciency η,
the electron density ne, the number of stored ions Ni, the
nominal length L = 1.5 m of the interaction zone and the
ring circumference C = 55.4 m using the relation

α(Erel) =

R(Erel) − R(Eref )
γ−2
i η ne(Erel)NiL/C

+ α(Eref )

(7)

where γi = 1 + Ei/(mic2) is the relativistic Lorentz fac-
tor for the transformation between the c. m. and the

laboratory frames where the ions of mass mi have the
kinetic energy Ei. The detection eﬃciency of the CsI-
scintillation detector [34] used to detect the recombined
ions is very close to unity for count rates up to 2.5
MHz. The second term in Eq. (7) is to be added in
case of a non-negligible electron-ion recombination rate
at the reference energy. We insert the theoretical RR
rate at Eref = 131.5 eV which we have calculated to be
α(Eref ) = 1.39 × 10−11 cm3/s using a semi-classical for-
mula for the radiative recombination cross section [35]

with R denoting the Rydberg constant and kn being cor-
rection factors given by Andersen and Bolko [36]. This
expression for recombination on bare nuclei is used to
approximately describe RR on a lithium-like core by in-
troducing the lowest quantum number nmin = 2 and
weight factors tn accounting for partial occupation of n-
shells. In our calculation we use t2 = 7/8 and tn = 1 for
n > 2. For the maximum (cut oﬀ) quantum number we
use ncut = 150 as explained below.

After the generation of a recombination spectrum from
the experimental data via Eq. (7) a correction procedure
accounting for non-perfect beam overlap in the merging
sections of the cooler is applied [30] which in our case only
slightly redistributes the DR resonance strengths, result-
ing in DR peaks narrower and taller by small amounts.
The systematic uncertainty in the absolute recombina-
tion rate coeﬃcient is due to the ion and electron cur-
rent determination, the corrections accounting for the
merging and demerging sections of the electron and ion
beams, and the detection eﬃciency.
It is estimated to
be ±15% of the measured recombination rate coeﬃcient
[30]. The statistical uncertainty of the results presented
below amounts to less than 1% of the rate coeﬃcient
maximum.

B. Procedure for DRF measurements

The geometry of the magnetic and electric ﬁelds
present in the merging section of the electron cooler is
sketched in Fig. 1. We choose the z-axis to be deﬁned
by the ion beam direction. The magnetic guiding ﬁeld ~B
deﬁnes the electron beam direction. The ﬁeld strength B
is limited both towards low and high values. Only ﬁelds
B > 25 mT guarantee a reliable operation of the electron
cooler. The maximum tolerable current through the gen-
erating coils limits B to at most 80 mT. Correction coils
allow the steering of the electron beam in the x-y plane.
In the ﬁrst place these are used to minimize the trans-
verse ﬁeld components Bx and By with respect to the ion
beam, such that the two beams are collinear and centered
to each other. The collinearity is inferred indirectly from

4

beam proﬁle measurements of the cooled ion beam [33]
with an accuracy of ∼ 0.2 mrad; i. e. the transverse mag-
netic ﬁeld components caused by imperfections in the
beam alignment amounts at most to 2×10−4B. Resid-
ual ﬁelds which may vary in size and direction along the
overlap length, are expected to be also of this magni-
tude. Since the settings of the various steering magnets
result from a rather tedious beam optimization process,
they are not exactly reproduced after each optimization
procedure that is required e. g. after a change of the
magnetic guiding ﬁeld Bz. This means that the residual
transverse magnetic ﬁelds for the collinear geometry may
also slightly vary from one set of cooler settings to an-
other. All uncertainties in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld
translate into an uncertainty in the motional electric ﬁeld
of less than ±10 V/cm in our present experiment.
In DRF measurements we oﬀset the current through
the correction coils to generate additional magnetic ﬁeld
components Bx and By. Their inﬂuence on the stored ion
beam is negligible, i. e. the ion beam is still travelling with
velocity vi in z-direction. However, in the frame of the ion
beam the magnetic ﬁeld components Bx and By generate
x + B2
y
in the x-y plane rotated out of the y direction by the
azimuthal angle φ = arctan(By/Bx) = arctan(Ex/Ey),
i. e. E⊥ = Ey for φ = 0. The electrons (due to their
much lower mass) follow the resulting magnetic ﬁeld
vector ~B which now crosses the ion beam at the an-
y/Bz). Two consequences are
to be dealt with: i) The ion beam now probes diﬀerent
portions of the space charge well of the electron beam.
This reduces the energy resolution.
In order to mini-
mize this eﬀect we used a rather small electron density
of only 5.4× 106 cm−3 at cooling, i. e. one order of mag-
nitude smaller than in the Si11+ experiment of Bartsch
et al. [14]. ii) The angle θ between electron beam and ion
beam explicitly enters the formula for the transformation
from the laboratory system to the c. m. system which is
easily derived from the conservation of four-momentum.
It reads

gle θ = arctan(qB2

x = viqB2

Erel = mic2(1 + µ)"s1 +

with the mass ratio µ = me/mi,

Γ = γiγe −q(γ2

i − 1)(γ2

e − 1) cos θ

(10)

and γe = 1 + Ee/mec2; Ee denotes the electron labo-
ratory energy.
It is obvious that the cooling condition
Erel = 0 can only be reached for γi = γe and θ = 0, i. e.
for Γ = 1. In regular ﬁeld-free measurements a scheme of
intermittent cooling is used during data taking, i. e. after
each measured energy a cooling interval (Erel = 0) is in-
serted. For DRF measurements this would require rapid
switching from θ 6= 0 to cooling with θ = 0. It turned out

that such a procedure heavily distorts the electron beam
mainly because of the slow response of the power supplies
controlling the steering coils. Under such conditions use-
ful measurements could not be performed. Therefore,
we omitted the intermittent cooling and reference mea-
surement intervals, thereby losing resolution. After each
injection into the ring and an appropriate cooling time
the correction coils were set to produce a deﬁned E⊥ and
the cathode voltage was ramped very quickly through a
preset range with a dwell-time of only 1 ms per measure-
ment point. In such a manner a spectrum for one E⊥
setting was collected within only 4 s. After termination
of the voltage ramp the correction coils were set back to
θ = 0 and the whole cycle started again with the injec-
tion of ions into the ring. In subsequent cycles a range
of typically 30 preset E⊥ values was scanned. Each spec-
trum was measured as many times as needed for reaching
a satisfying level of statistical errors. This whole proce-
dure was repeated for diﬀerent settings of the guiding
ﬁeld strength Bz.

In order to compare only contributions from DR to the
measured spectra we subtracted an empirical background
function αBG(Erel) = a0+a1Erel+a2/(1+a3Erel+a4E2
rel)
with the coeﬃcients ai determined by ﬁtting αBG(Erel)
to those parts of the spectrum which do not exhibit DR
resonances. One should note that a proper calculation of
the RR rate coeﬃcient is hampered by the fact that for
θ 6= 0 the electron velocity distribution probed by the ion
beam cannot be described by Eq. (5).

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Recombination at zero electric ﬁeld

1. DR cross section

For the ∆n = 0 DR channels of Li-like Ni25+, i. e. for
DR involving excitations which do not change the main
quantum number of any electron in the 1s22s core, Eq.
(1) reads more explicitly

e− + Ni25+(1s22s1/2) → Ni24+(1s22pjnℓ)
→(cid:26) Ni24+(1s22s1/2nℓ) + hν (type I)

Ni24+(1s22pjn′ℓ′) + hν′ (type II)

(11)

The lowest Rydberg states which are energetically al-
lowed are n = 13 and n = 11 for 2s1/2 → 2p1/2 and
2s1/2 → 2p3/2 core excitations, respectively.
The Ni25+(1s22s1/2) recombination spectrum has been
measured for 0 ≤ |Erel| ≤ 131.5 eV. The result is shown
in Fig. 2. At Erel = 0 a sharp rise of the recombination
rate due to RR is observed. At higher energies DR reso-
nances due to ∆n = 0 2s1/2 → 2pj transitions occur, the
lowest resonance appearing at Erel = 0 eV. Individual
2pjnℓ resonances are resolved for n ≤ 32. Their reso-
nance strengths have been extracted from the measured

spectrum by ﬁrst subtracting the theoretical recombina-
tion rate coeﬃcient due to RR (cf. section II A) where the
c. m. velocity spread can be neglected since Erel is very
large compared to kT⊥ and kTk. In principle the resulting
rate coeﬃcient should be zero at oﬀ-resonance energies.
However, we ﬁnd that probably due to our approximate
treatment of RR (cf. Eq. (8)) small non-zero rate coeﬃ-
cients remain after subtraction of the calculated RR rate
coeﬃcient. These are removed by further subtracting a
smooth background before the observed DR resonance
structures are ﬁtted by Gaussians. (Details of the ob-
served smooth RR rate were not further investigated in
the present work.) The resulting values for resonance po-
sitions and strengths are listed in Table I. The 2p1/213ℓ
and 2p3/211ℓ resonances at about 2.5 eV and 4.5 eV,
respectively, exhibit a splitting due to the interaction of
the nℓ-Rydberg electron with the 1s22pj core. For higher
n resonances this splitting decreases and cannot be ob-
served because of the ﬁnite experimental energy spread
which increases as √Erel. The 2pj Rydberg series limits,
E∞, are obtained from a ﬁt of the resonance positions
En with n ≥ 16 to the Rydberg formula
n − δ(cid:19)2

En = E∞ − R(cid:18) q

(12)

with the quantum defect δ as a second ﬁt parameter.
The ﬁt results are listed in Table II, where spectroscopic
values [37] for the series limits are also given. Our val-
ues agree with the spectroscopic values within 0.6%, i. e.
within the experimental uncertainty of the energy scale
[29]. The result that the ﬁtted quantum defects are al-
most zero reﬂects the fact that the interaction between
the core electrons and the Rydberg electron is weak.

The measured DR rate decreases already below the
2p1/2 and 2p3/2 series limits as obtained from the ﬁt to
the peak positions.
(cf. Fig. 2). This discrepancy re-
sults from ﬁeld ionization of high Rydberg states with
n > nf ≈ (3.2 × 108V/cm q3/Edip)1/4 in the charge an-
alyzing dipole magnet (see Sec. II) with magnetic ﬁeld
strength Bdip = 0.71 T where the moving ion experi-
ences the motional electric ﬁeld Edip = viBdip (nf is the
classical ﬁeld ionization limit). A more realistic value
for the cut-oﬀ has to account for Stark splitting and
tunnelling eﬀects.
In Ref. [10] an approximate value
ncut ≈ (7.3 × 108V/cm q3/Edip)1/4 was found. For the
calculation of the actual cut-oﬀ quantum number ncut
relevant in this experiment one has to take into account
that on the way from the cooler to the dipole magnet
states with n > nf may radiatively decay to states below
nf . An approximate calculation of this eﬀect [38] yields
ncut = 150 for the present case.

An estimate of the DR line strength escaping detec-
tion because of ﬁeld ionization can be made by extrap-
olating the measured DR line strength to n = ∞ em-
ploying the n−3 scaling of the autoionization and the
type II (cf. Eq. (11)) radiative rates [39]. For autoion-
ization rates we make the ansatz Aa(nℓ) = Aa/n3 for

5

0 ≤ ℓ ≤ ℓmax and Aa(nℓ) = 0 for ℓmax < ℓ < n. Rates
for the sum of type I and type II radiative transitions we
represent as Ar(nℓ) = A(I)
r /n3. The same repre-
sentations of the relevant rates have already been used
by Kilgus et al. [29] in a recombination study of isoelec-
tronic Cu26+ ions. After summation over all ℓ substates
Eq. (4) simpliﬁes to

¯σnEn = S0

]

(13)

with S0 = 2.475(2jc + 1)(ℓmax + 1)2× 10−30cm2eV2s. For
the statistical weights in Eq. (4) we have used gi = 2
and gd = 2(2ℓ + 1)(2jc + 1). Here, jc is the total an-
gular momentum quantum number of the core excited
state i. e. jc = 1/2 and 3/2 in the present case. The ﬁrst
step of the extrapolation procedure consists of adjusting
the model parameters such that Eq. (13) ﬁts the mea-
sured DR line strengths. Here the values for A(I)
r have
been taken from atomic structure calculations [40] while
S0, Aa and A(II)
r were allowed to vary during the ﬁt. It
turned out that the ﬁt is not very sensitive to large varia-
tions of the Auger rates Aa. In this situation we kept also
the Auger rates ﬁxed at values which have been inferred
from atomic structure calculations and which are meant
to be order of magnitude estimates only. In Fig. 3 we
have plotted the measured and ﬁtted resonance strengths
(multiplied by the resonance energy) as a function of the
main quantum number. The actual parameters used for
drawing the ﬁt curves are listed in Table II. The ﬁt has
been restricted to n ≥ 20 for both the 2p1/2 and the 2p3/2
series because additional Coster-Kronig decay channels
2p3/2nℓ → 2p1/2ǫℓ′ open up when En crosses the 2p1/2
series limit. A corresponding discontinuous decrease of
the 2p3/2nℓ DR resonance strength can be clearly dis-
cerned in Fig. 3. Since the additional autoionizing chan-
nels are included for the 2p3/2nℓ series of resonances but
not for the 2p1/2nℓ series, Aa for the 2p3/2nℓ series is
more than a factor of 2 higher than Aa for the 2p1/2nℓ
series. A factor of 2 would just correspond to the ratio
of statistical weights.

Inserting the ﬁt parameters listed in Table II into
Eqs. (12) and (13) now allows an extrapolation of the
DR resonance positions and strengths, respectively, to
be obtained for arbitrary high n. In order to check the
quality of the extrapolation we have convoluted the ex-
trapolated DR cross section with the experimental elec-
tron energy distribution using the electron beam tem-
peratures kBT|| = 0.25 meV and kBT⊥ = 10 meV. Af-
ter adding the semiclassically calculated RR rate coef-
ﬁcient — as described above — the resulting extrapo-
lated DR+RR recombination rate coeﬃcient is plotted in
Fig. 4 together with the experimental one. Despite the
very simple model assumptions the calculated recombi-
nation rate agrees with the measured one also over the
energy intervals covered by the 2pjnℓ resonances with
n > 31 which are not resolved individually and there-

6

fore have not been used for the ﬁts. Deviations for the
Ni24+(1s22p3/2nℓ) resonances with n ≤ 19 stem from
the fact that for these resonances the Coster-Kronig de-
cay channels to Ni25+(1s22p1/2) are closed whereas the
ﬁt has been made to resonances where they are open. At
energies close to the series limits slight deviations from
the model rate occurs even when the expected value of
ncut = 150 is inserted into the model (dashed line in
Fig. 4). The origin of this discrepancy has probably to
be searched for in the approximations made in both the
ﬁeld ionization model and in the model rate descriptions,
in particluar regarding the dependence of the angular
momentum ℓ which may be aﬀected by even the small
residual electric ﬁelds in the interaction region.

2. Maxwellian plasma rate coeﬃcient

The comparison between the measured data and the
calculated extrapolation to n → ∞ (full line in Fig. 4)
suggests that only a minor part of the total Ni25+ ∆n =
0 DR resonance strength has not been measured. This
enables us to derive from our measurement the Ni25+ DR
rate coeﬃcient in a plasma. To this end the experimental
DR rate coeﬃcient is substituted by the extrapolated one
at energies ∼ 3 eV below the series limits. Compared to
using the experimental result without extrapolation this
results in a correction of the plasma rate coeﬃcient of at
most 5%. The experimental DR rate coeﬃcient including
the high n-extrapolation is convoluted by an isotropic
Maxwellian electron velocity distribution characterized
by the electron temperature Te. The resulting ∆n = 0
DR plasma rate coeﬃcient is displayed in Fig. 5 (thick full
line). Summing experimental and extrapolation errors,
the total uncertainty of the DR rate coeﬃcient in plasmas
determined in this work amounts to ±20%.
eﬃcient is provided by the following ﬁt formula

A convenient representation of the plasma DR rate co-

α(Te) = T −3/2

e Xi

ci exp (−Ei/kBTe)

(14)

It has the same functional dependence on the plasma
electron temperature as the widely used Burgess formula
[41], where the coeﬃcients ci and Ei are related to oscil-
lator strengths and excitation energies, respectively. The
results for the ﬁt to the experimental Ni25+ ∆n = 0 DR
rate coeﬃcient in a plasma (thick full line in Fig. 5) are
summarized in Table III. The ﬁtted curve cannot be dis-
tinguished from the experimental plasma rate coeﬃcient
in a plot as presented in Fig. 5.

In Fig. 5 we also compare our results with theoreti-
cal results for ∆n = 0 DR by Mewe et al. [42] (dashed
line), Romanik [43] (dash-dotted line) and Teng et al.
[44] (dashed-dot-dotted line) who interpolated DR cal-
culations performed by Chen [45] for selected lithiumlike
ions. At temperatures kBTe > 1 eV the rate of Mewe et

al., which is based on the Burgess formula [41], overesti-
mates our experimental result by up to a factor of ∼ 5.
At lower temperatures the experimental result is under-
estimated by factors up to 10. Above an electron temper-
ature of 30 eV Romanik’s theoretical result agrees with
our ∆n = 0 DR rate coeﬃcient to within 15%, which
is within the 20% experimental accuracy.
In this en-
ergy range the interpolation result of Teng et al. under-
estimates the experimental rate coeﬃcient by 20–30%.
It should be noted that neither the calculation of Ro-
manik nor that of Teng et al. covers temperatures below
10 eV. When compared with our RR calculation (thin
full line in Fig. 5) our experimental result shows that in
the temperature range of 1 to 10 eV, where Ni25+ ions
may exist in photoionized plasmas, DR is still signiﬁ-
cant. The importance of DR in low temperature plasmas
has been pointed out recently by Savin et al. [46] who
measured DR of ﬂuorine-like Fe17+ ions. At higher tem-
peratures Romanik’s calculation [43] suggests that above
100 eV ∆n = 1 DR contributions become signiﬁcant (up-
per dash-dotted line in Fig. 5).

B. DRF measurements

Fig. 6 shows a series of Ni25+ recombination spectra
measured in the presence of external electric ﬁelds E⊥
ranging from 0 to 270 V/cm. The magnetic ﬁeld on the
axis of the cooler has been Bz = 80 mT. Due to the
altered measurement scheme that leaves out the inter-
mittent cooling of the ion beam, the energy resolution
is reduced compared to Fig. 2. Now individual 2pjnℓ
DR resonances are resolved only up to n = 21. Two
features in the series of spectra are to be noted. Firstly,
the strength of the DR resonances occurring below 47 eV
does not depend on E⊥. Secondly, the strength of the un-
resolved high-n DR resonances increases with increasing
ﬁeld strength. This can been seen more clearly from the
close-up presented in Fig. 7. At energies of more than
10 eV below the 2pj series limits the diﬀerent DR spec-
tra lie perfectly on top of each other whereas at higher
energies (i. e. n > 30) an increase of the DR intensities
by up to a factor of 1.5 at E⊥ = 270 V/cm is observed.
The degraded resolution of the DR spectrum does not
allow us to resolve n levels in the range of the electric
ﬁeld enhancement.
In order to quantify this DR rate
enhancement we consider integrated recombination rates
with the integration intervals chosen as marked in Fig. 7.
The integration intervals 44.0–53.5 eV and 66.2–
76.0 eV include all 2pjnℓ resonances with n ≥ 31 for
j = 1/2 and j = 3/2, respectively. In the following we
denote the resulting integrals by I1/2 and I3/2. The en-
ergy range 44.0–53.5 eV also contains 2p3/2nℓ resonances
with 16 ≤ n ≤ 19. These resonances, however, are not
aﬀected by the electric ﬁeld strengths used in our ex-
periment. Consequently, any change in the magnitude
of I1/2 as a function of E⊥ we attribute to ﬁeld eﬀects

on 2p1/2nℓ resonances. As a check of the proper nor-
malization of the DR spectra we additionally monitor
the integral I0 = R 18eV
2eV αDR(Erel)dErel which comprises
the strengths of the 2p3/211ℓ, 2p3/212ℓ and 2p1/2nℓ DR
resonances with 13 ≤ n ≤ 15. Since these low n reso-
nances are not aﬀected by E⊥ we expect I0 to be con-
stant. Any deviation of I0 from a constant value would
indicate a reduction of beam overlap due to too large a
tilting angle θ of the electron beam. The maximum an-
gle θmax to which the overlap of the electron beam with
the ion beam is ensured over the full interaction length
L is given by tan θmax = (de − di)/L. With the geomet-
rical values given above one obtains θmax ≈ 1◦. Apart
from the highest E⊥ at φ = 180◦ and at the lowest mag-
netic guiding ﬁeld, i. e. at Bz = 41.8 mT, the condition
θ < θmax was always met. This is exempliﬁed in the up-
per panel of Fig. 8 where I0, I1/2 and I3/2 are shown for
-270 V/cm ≤ E⊥ ≤ 220 V/cm. There, positive (nega-
tive) ﬁeld strength indicates φ = 0◦ (φ = 180◦). While
I1/2 and I3/2 clearly exhibit a ﬁeld eﬀect which is nearly
symmetric about E⊥ = 0 V/cm, I0 is independent of E⊥.
The fact that the increase of the integrated recombi-
nation rate coeﬃcient is independent of the sign of the
electric ﬁeld vector is expected from the cylindrical sym-
metry of the merged beams arrangement in the electron
cooler. However, for the entire experimental setup this
symmetry is broken by the charge analyzing dipole mag-
net with an electric ﬁeld vector lying in the bending plane
(the x-y plane of the coordinate frame deﬁned in the in-
teraction region). This, in principle, could lead to re-
distribution of population between diﬀerent m substates
in the dipole magnet [47] and a resulting ﬁeld ionization
probability depending on the azimuthal angle φ of the
motional electric ﬁeld vector in the cooler. In order to
clarify this question we took a series of DRF spectra with
φ ranging from 5◦ to 175◦. At the same time the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds were kept ﬁxed at E⊥ = 100 V/cm
and Bz = 80 mT. A scan around a full circle was prohib-
ited by the limited output of the power supplies used for
steering the electron beam in the particular arrangement
of this experiment. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 8
no signiﬁcant dependence of the integrated recombina-
tion rates on the azimuthal angle φ was found.

As a measure for the magnitude of the ﬁeld enhance-

ment we introduce the ﬁeld enhancement factor

rj(E⊥, Bz) = Cj(Bz)

Ij (E⊥, Bz)
I0(E⊥, Bz)

(15)

for j = 1/2 or 3/2 and the constant Cj(Bz) chosen such
that rj (0, Bz) = 1.0 (see below). Plots of enhancement
factors as a function of E⊥ are shown in Fig. 9 for diﬀer-
ent values of Bz. Since the ﬁeld eﬀect is independent of
the orientation of the electric ﬁeld in the x-y plane data
points for φ = 0◦ and φ = 180◦ are plotted together. The
enhancement factor exhibits a linear dependence on the
electric ﬁeld. Exceptions occur for Bz = 41.8 mT and
φ = 180◦ at E⊥ values where θ becomes maximal, and

7

around E⊥ = 0 V/cm. In the former case the complete
overlap of the ion beam and the electron beam over the
full length of the interaction region is lost. This is indi-
cated by a reduction of I0, and apparently a consistent
normalization cannot be carried out. In the latter case
residual electric and magnetic ﬁeld components resulting
e. g. from a non-perfect alignment of the beams prevent
us from reaching E⊥ = 0 eV. After excluding all data
points with E⊥ ≤ 10 V/cm and those with φ = 180◦,
E⊥ ≥ 200 V/cm for Bz = 41.8 mT, we were able to ﬁt
straight lines to the measured ﬁeld enhancement factors
as a function of E⊥. The constants Cj(Bz) in Eq. (15)
have been chosen such that the ﬁtted straight lines yield
r(ﬁt)
j

(0, Bz) = 1.0.

As a measure for the electric-ﬁeld enhancement of the

DR rate enhancement we now consider the slopes

sj(Bz) =

dr(ﬁt)

j

(E⊥, Bz)
dE⊥

(16)

of the ﬁtted straight lines, which are displayed as a func-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld strength in Fig. 10. The er-
ror bars correspond to statistical errors only. Systematic
uncertainties e. g. due to residual ﬁelds are diﬃcult to
estimate. Nevertheless, their order of magnitude can be
judged from the ≈ 10% diﬀerence between the two data
points at Bz = 80 mT which have been measured with
diﬀerent cooler settings.

For all magnetic ﬁelds used the electric ﬁeld depen-
dence of the rate enhancement factor is steeper for the
2p3/2nℓ series of Rydberg resonances than that for the
2p1/2nℓ series. This can be understood from the fact
that the multiplicity of states and consequently the num-
ber of states which can be mixed is two times higher for
j = 3/2 than for j = 1/2. Following this argument one
would expect a ratio of 2 for the respective incremen-
tal integrated recombination rates Ij(E⊥, Bz)−Ij(0, Bz).
From our measurements we ﬁnd lower values scatter-
ing around 1.5 indicating a somewhat reduced number
of states available for ﬁeld mixing within the series of
Ni24+(1s22p3/2nℓ) DR resonances. In calculations for Li-
like Si11+ and C3+ ions ratios, even less than 1 have been
found [16,48]. This has been attributed to the electro-
static quadrupole-quadrupole interaction between the 2p
and the nℓ Rydberg electron in the intermediate doubly
excited state, which more eﬀectively lifts the degener-
acy between the 2p3/2nℓ than between the 21/2nℓ levels.
Another reason for the reduced number of 2p3/2nℓ states
participating in DRF might be the existence of additional
Coster-Kronig decay channels for these resonances with
n ≥ 20 to Ni25+(1s22p1/2) (cf. section III A).
Slopes for the relative electric ﬁeld enhancement ac-
cording to Eq. (16) were previously determined in mea-
surements by Bartsch and coworkers for the lighter iso-
electronic ions Si11+, Cl14+ and Ti19+ [14,19,20]. The
present results are compared with these previous data
in Fig. 11.
It should be noted that the comparison is
only semi-quantitative, because the choice of integration

8

ranges for the calculation of the integrated recombina-
tion coeﬃcients is somewhat arbitrary and diﬀerent cut-
oﬀ quantum numbers ncut exist for the diﬀerent ions (cf.
Table IV). Clearly, the relative enhancement for a given
electric ﬁeld strength is much lower for Ni25+ than for the
lighter ions studied so far, with the reduction for the step
from lithium-like titanium (Z = 22) to nickel (Z = 28)
apparently much larger than the step from, e. g., chlorine
(Z = 17) to Z = 22. As a general trend with increasing
Z, the radiative decay rates Ar decrease ∝ Z for type
I transitions (see Eq. (11)) and ∝ (Z − 3)4 for type II
transitions, while the autoionization rates are rather in-
dependent of Z. This shifts the range where the low-ℓ
autoionization rates are larger than the radiative stabi-
lization rates (the condition for DR enhancement by ℓ-
mixing to occur [15]) down to states of lower principal
quantum number n for increasing Z. For Ni25+ the de-
gree of mixing reached by the typical experimental ﬁeld
strengths appears to be much reduced as compared to
lighter ions. In addition, a clear dependence of the elec-
tric ﬁeld enhancement on the the magnetic ﬁeld strength
is no longer observed for Ni25+. To clarify the reason for
the strong reduction of both the electric and the addi-
tional magnetic ﬁeld eﬀect in the heavy system studied
here, detailed quantitative calculations are desirable.

External electric and magnetic ﬁelds are ubiquitous in
astrophysical or fusion plasmas. Therefore, it is of in-
terest to look into the implications of the ﬁeld enhance-
ment eﬀect for the Ni25+ ∆n = 0 DR rate coeﬃcient in
a plasma. As an example we show in Fig. 12 the ratio
of rate coeﬃcients derived from two measurements with
and without external electric ﬁeld. As compared to zero
electric ﬁeld, the recombination coeﬃcient at our highest
experimental electric ﬁeld strength (E⊥ = 270 V/cm at
Bz = 80 mT) is enhanced by up to 11%. This value
only represents a lower limit for the enhancement at
the given ﬁeld strength, as we observe DR resonances
due to Ni24+(1s22pjnℓ) intermediate states only up to
ncut ≈ 150. It should also be noted that in our experi-
ments we did not reach the electric ﬁeld strength where
the DR rate enhancement saturates.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The recombination of lithium-like Ni25+ ions has been
experimentally studied in detail. Spectroscopic infor-
mation on individual DR resonances associated with
Ni24+(1s22pjnℓ) intermediate states, which have been ex-
perimentally resolved up to n = 32, has been extracted
and the ∆n = 0 DR plasma rate coeﬃcient has been de-
rived. Our experimental result is underestimated by up
to a factor of 2 by semi-empirically calculated rate coef-
ﬁcients. At plasma temperatures above 10 eV, results of
detailed theoretical calculations are available [43] which
agree well with the experiment. At lower temperatures,
where Ni25+ ions may exist in photoionized plasmas, no

data for the DR rate coeﬃcient have been previously
available.

In the presence of external electric ﬁelds up to
300 V/cm, the measured DR resonance strength is en-
hanced by a factor 1.5; a rather weak eﬀect in compari-
son with previous measurements at Z = 11, 17 and 22.
Due to the overall weakness of the ﬁeld eﬀect for Ni25+
ions, a marked dependence of the DR rate enhancement
on the strength of a crossed magnetic ﬁeld as observed
for Cl14+ and Ti19+ ions has not been detectable in the
present investigation.

Experimental limitations prevented us from obtaining
an energy resolution in our DRF measurements compara-
ble to that achieved in the ﬁeld-free measurement. Con-
sequently, we could not resolve a Ni24+(1s22pjnℓ) DR
resonance with n high enough to exhibit a ﬁeld eﬀect.
Such an observation would have facilitated a direct com-
parison with ab initio calculations, which due to the large
number of nℓm states to be considered, presently can
only treat a single n manifold of Rydberg states in the
presence of crossed ~E and ~B ﬁelds [16]. Improvements
of this situation can be expected in the near future from
the steady increase of computing power on the theoreti-
cal side, and on the experimental side from a dedicated
electron target which is presently being installed at the
TSR. With the electron target and the electron cooler
operating at the same time we will be able to perform
DRF measurements with continuously cooled ion beams,
yielding DRF spectra with increased resolution.

TABLE IV. Parameters in DRF experiments with Li-like
ions. For each ion the ﬁeld eﬀect has been quantiﬁed by
considering an integrated DR rate coeﬃcient which com-
prises the resonance strengths of 2pj nℓ DR resonances with
nmin ≤ n ≤ nmax where nmax is the approximate cut-oﬀ quan-
tum number due to ﬁeld ionization in the charge analyzing
dipole magnet. It depends on the ion beam energy and the
ion’s charge state [38].

FIG. 3. Product of strength and resonance energy of the
2pjnℓ DR resonances for j = 1/2 (closed symbols) and
j = 3/2 (open symbols) as extracted from the experimen-
tal recombination spectrum. Statistical error bars are mostly
smaller than the symbol size. The strengths of the 2p3/214ℓ
and 2p3/215ℓ resonances have been obtained by subtract-
ing interpolated values for the 2p1/220ℓ and 2p1/223ℓ reso-
nance strengths from the measured peak areas at 31.7 eV and
37.3 eV, respectively. The thick full curves represent ﬁts ac-
cording to Eq. (13) with the ﬁt parameters listed in Table II.

FIG. 5. Ni25+ ∆n = 0 DR plasma rate coeﬃcient as de-
rived from our measurement (thick full line, estimated error
±20% as indicated). Also shown are theoretical results of
Mewe et al. [42] (dashed line), Romanik [43] (dash-dotted
line) and Teng et al. [44] (dash-dot-dotted line). At temper-
atures kBTe > 100 eV two DR rates by Romanik are shown,
with the upper one additionally containing ∆n = 1 DR con-
tributions. The RR rate coeﬃcient (thin full line) has been
calculated from the RR cross section given by Eq. (8) with
q = 25 and nmax = 150.

The enhancement is larger for the series of 2p3/2nℓ resonances
(open symbols) as compared to the 2p1/2nℓ series (closed sym-
bols). Triangles pointing upwards (downwards) mark data
points measured at φ = 0◦ (φ = 180◦). The data points
which for experimental reasons (see text) have been excluded
from the linear ﬁts (full curves) are marked additionally by

Si11+ (open circle) [14], Cl14+ (diamonds) [19], Ti19+ (full

are drawn to guide the eye. For Ti19+ and Ni25+ where the
ﬁeld eﬀects on the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 series of DR resonances
have been determined separately, the corresponding slopes
have been averaged. Clearly the eﬀects of external electric
and magnetic ﬁelds on DR decrease with increasing nuclear

using crossed atomic and laser beams to reduce the Doppler width signiﬁcantly below the isotope
shifts in the 423 nm transition. The loading rate of ions into the trap is studied under a range
of experimental parameters for the abundant isotope 40Ca+. Using the ﬂuorescence of the atomic
beam at 423 nm as a measure of the Ca number density, we estimate a lower limit for the absolute
photo-ionization cross-section. We achieve loading and laser-cooling of all the naturally occurring
isotopes, without the need for enriched sources. Laser-heating/cooling is observed to enhance the
isotope-selectivity. In the case of the rare species 43Ca+ and 46Ca+, which have not previously been
laser-cooled, the loading is not fully isotope-selective but we show that pure crystals of 43Ca+ may
nevertheless be obtained. We ﬁnd that for loading 40Ca+ the 389 nm laser may be replaced by an
incoherent source.

INTRODUCTION

Resonance-enhanced photo-ionization for loading ion
traps was ﬁrst demonstrated with magnesium and cal-
cium ions by Kjærgaard et al. [1]. The same group has
recently used crossed-beam Doppler-free excitation of the
4s5p 1P1 calcium transition, followed
272 nm 4s2 1S0 ↔
by photo-ionization, to load selectively all the naturally
occurring isotopes of this element; the loading was not
observed directly, but by using charge-exchange to in-
fer the presence of the other isotopes from the ﬂuores-
cence of laser-cooled 40Ca+ ions which replaced them [2].
4s4p 1P1 Ca
Gulde et al. showed that, using the 4s2 1S0 ↔
transition at 423 nm, followed by excitation close to the
continuum by an ultraviolet photon, photo-ionization is
around ﬁve orders of magnitude more eﬃcient than con-
ventional electron bombardment ionization [3].

As pointed out by these authors, photo-ionization has a
number of advantages over electron bombardment. Only
the desired species is loaded into the ion trap, allow-
ing pure crystals of particular isotopes to be obtained.
Since no electron beam is involved, there is no charging
of insulating parts of the trap structure, which leads to
drifting electric ﬁelds that for many experiments must
be accurately compensated. The eﬃciency of the photo-
ionization process allows much lower number densities of
neutral atoms in the interaction region, greatly reducing
the quantities of material sputtered onto the trap elec-
trodes; it has been shown that clean electrode surfaces
reduce the heating rate of trapped ions from the motional
ground state [4], an important consideration for quantum
logic experiments in ion traps. For experiments in which
high-ﬁnesse optical cavities are combined with ion traps,
the lower atomic beam density reduces the degradation of

the mirror surfaces and can avoid the need for a separate
“loading trap” [5, 6].

Our particular interest lies in using 43Ca+ as an ion-
qubit in quantum logic experiments [7]. This ion has
a number of advantages as a qubit [8, 9]; it is also an
attractive candidate for a trapped ion optical frequency
standard [10, 11]. The most obvious diﬃculty in work-
ing with 43Ca+ is its low natural abundance of 0.135%.
In this paper we describe the development of a photo-
ionization system capable of loading 43Ca+ into a Paul
trap from a natural abundance source.
(Isotopically-
enriched sources are available, although the maximum
enrichment of
80% [12] means that it would still be ad-
vantageous to use an isotope-selective method for reliable
loading of this isotope.)

∼

We describe the crossed atomic and laser beam setup
4s4p 1P1 transi-
for excitation of the 423 nm 4s2 1S0 ↔
tion with a Doppler width narrow compared with the
isotope shifts. Spectroscopy of the atomic beam is used
to ensure the intensity of the 423 nm laser is below sat-
uration (to avoid reducing the isotope-selectivity of this
step by power broadening), and also to estimate the num-
ber density of atoms in the beam. Photo-ionization from
the 4s4p 1P1 level is achieved by a 389 nm photon; since
we expect the photo-ionization cross-section to be only
weakly dependent on the photon energy, we use a non-
stabilized diode laser for this step. We study the photo-
ionization trap loading rate as a function of the power
and detuning of the 423 nm laser, and as a function of the
power of the 389 nm laser. We ﬁnd that the 389 nm laser
photo-ionizes equivalently above or below lasing thresh-
old, and that it can be replaced by a much cheaper in-
coherent source if high photo-ionization rates are not re-
quired. We estimate the absolute photo-ionization load-

ing eﬃciency and compare it with that for electron bom-
bardment ionization in our apparatus.

The sensitivity of the loading rate as a function of
the 423 nm detuning determines the isotope-selectivity
which can be attained. However, for very rare species
with mass number X a practical limitation is the rate
at which charge-exchange replaces the desired, trapped,
ions X Ca+ by the abundant 40Ca+ ions issuing from the
oven. We demonstrate loading of all the naturally occur-
ring isotopes, including 43Ca+ and the 0.004%-abundant
46Ca+. These two species are laser-cooled for the ﬁrst
time in the experiments reported here. The limited
isotope-selectivity attainable for these rare ions means
that some form of “puriﬁcation” of the ions loaded is
necessary [13, 14]; in the case of 43Ca+ we show that this
is possible with no loss of the desired species. Hence it
should be possible to load arbitrarily large crystals of this
important ion.

Level diagrams for 43Ca and 43Ca+, showing the en-
ergy levels and transitions relevant to these experiments,
are shown in ﬁgure 1.
Isotope shifts in the six transi-
tions shown are summarized in table I, together with the
abundances of the six naturally occurring isotopes.

II. APPARATUS

A.

Ion trap

×

The apparatus consists of a linear radio-frequency (r.f.,
6.2 MHz) Paul trap in an ultra-high vacuum system
10−11 torr), with diode laser
(background pressure < 2
systems available to drive all the transitions shown in
ﬁgure 1. Details of the trap are given in [18]. Typical
axial and radial frequencies used in the present exper-
iments are 170 kHz and 500 kHz respectively. Auxiliary
d.c. electrodes are used to compensate stray electric ﬁelds
to the level of about 1 V/m using a photon-r.f. correla-
tion technique applied to the ﬂuorescence from a single
trapped ion [21]. A magnetic ﬁeld of
3 G is applied to
prevent optical pumping into magnetic sub-states [11].

∼

B. Lasers

The lasers are all of the external-cavity grating-
stabilized Littrow design, except the 389 nm laser which
has no grating stabilization. The blue and ultravio-
let laser diodes are all GaN devices, the infrared ones
GaAlAs. The grating-stabilized lasers may be locked to
tunable, stabilized, optical cavities to reduce linewidths
and medium-term frequency drift below 5 MHz. The
laser frequencies are set within about 100 MHz of the
ionic transitions with wavemeters. Doppler-free satu-
rated absorption spectroscopy in a calcium hollow cath-
ode is used to monitor the 423 nm laser frequency rel-
4s4p 1P1 atomic transition. The
ative to the 4s2 1S0 ↔
vacuum wavelength of the 389 nm free-running laser was

measured using a grating spectrograph to be 388.9(1) nm
at 20◦C (with negligible dependence on drive current);
above lasing threshold, the spectral width is expected
to be <
3 nm. For con-
venience of alignment, the 423 nm and 389 nm laser
beams are both injected into the same single-mode op-
tical ﬁbre to transport them to the trap; this ensures
that the beams are well overlapped in the interaction
region, which is centred on the trap. The transmis-
sion of the ﬁbre is

389 nm. The maximum intensities at the centre of these

the trap are: 10 mW/mm2 at 397 nm; 20 mW/mm2 at
393 nm; 6 mW/mm2 at 866 nm; 200 mW/mm2 at 854 nm;
650 mW/mm2 at 850 nm. These intensities are based on
the measured spot sizes for the various beams, which
range from 40–300 µm.

C. Detection system

Fluorescence from the interaction region at 423 nm and
397 nm acts as a diagnostic of neutral calcium and cal-
cium ions respectively. The trap region is imaged by a
compound lens onto an aperture to reject scattered light;
further lenses re-image the trap, via a violet ﬁlter, onto a
photomultiplier (PMT). A movable beamsplitter allows
a portion of the light to be directed to a charge-coupled
device (CCD) camera; the camera is used to detect the
presence of non-ﬂuorescing ions in the trap (revealed as
“gaps” in an otherwise regular crystal), and to check
whether the ions form a cold crystal or a hot cloud. The
net detection eﬃciency of the PMT system, including
the solid angle subtended by the lens and the quantum
eﬃciency of the PMT, was measured to be 0.13(2)% at
397 nm; the photon count rate observed from a single,
cold, 40Ca+ ion under conditions of near-saturation is
consistent with this ﬁgure. The net detection eﬃciency
at 423 nm is η = 0.15(3)%.

The discriminated pulses from the PMT are counted
directly by 10 MHz on-board counters in the computer
which controls the experiment; two alternately-gated
counters are used to eliminate read-out delay. For the
large peak photon counting rates encountered in studies
106 s−1), we correct
of the 423 nm ﬂuorescence (up to
the measured PMT count rate S′ for the maximum count-
ing rate S max = 10 MHz, assuming S
S max, to obtain
the true count rate S

S′/S max).

stainless steel tube (diameter 2 mm, wall thickness

the total angular momentum F . The nuclear spin is I = 7
2 . The largest hyperﬁne splitting in each term is indicated in MHz;
the levels approximately conform to an interval rule [15, 16]. Diagrams for the even isotopes are the same but with no hyperﬁne
structure. (a) 43Ca: the lifetime of the 4s4p 1P1 level is 4.49(4) ns [17] and the natural linewidth of the 423 nm transition
35.4(3) MHz. Photo-ionization from the 4s4p 1P1 level requires a photon of wavelength less than 389.8 nm. (b) 43Ca+: the
natural widths of the ultraviolet transitions are approximately 23 MHz, the lifetimes of the metastable D levels about 1.2 s [18].
Inset: Positions of the hyperﬁne components of the 393 nm and 397 nm transitions (solid lines, labelled with F lower : F upper)
and the isotope shifts of the even isotopes (dotted lines, labelled with the mass number), as a function of detuning ∆ relative

details for 43Ca+; note the change of scale.

oven is heated by passing a current (between 3 A and
6 A) along its length, which produces a beam of calcium
atoms directed towards the trap. Estimated oven tem-
peratures are in the range 500–650 K, depending on the
current used (section III C).

The oven is situated 22(2) mm from the centre of the
trap. The atomic beam is collimated by the r.f. trap elec-
trodes to an eﬀective aperture of length l = 1.7(1) mm
along the direction of the 423 nm/389 nm laser beams.
However, the detection system only images a limited
length of the interaction region (inset ﬁgure 2), so the
eﬀective aperture for observation of the 423 nm ﬂuores-
cence is reduced to l′ = 0.44(4) mm. Since the oven
oriﬁce is of comparable dimensions to l, l′ the angular
divergence of the beam is somewhat larger than these

distances would otherwise imply.

III. SPECTROSCOPY OF THE ATOMIC BEAM

We describe in this section spectroscopy of the 423 nm
transition, using the calcium atomic beam from the oven.
For optimal isotope-selectivity in the photo-ionization
loading, the narrowest possible linewidth of this transi-
tion is required.
Ideally the linewidth should be small
compared with the isotope shifts (table I), with the
lower limit being set by the 35.4(3) MHz natural width.
Other contributions to the homogeneous width include
power broadening (saturation), transit-time broadening
and laser linewidth. Collisional broadening is entirely

TABLE I: Abundances of the naturally occurring calcium isotopes [19], and isotope shifts for Ca and Ca+ transitions relevant
to this work. Shifts in the 423 nm transition are taken from [16]; uncertainties quoted are below 1 MHz. Shifts in the ultraviolet
Ca+ transitions were measured in [20]; we quote the (more accurate) measurements for the 397 nm transition: the shifts at
393 nm are all consistent with these. Shifts in the infrared transitions are from [15]; the data given are for the 854 nm transition,
which are again consistent with those for the other two lines. For the odd isotope, the shift of the centre of gravity of the
hyperﬁne components of each transition is given; note that in the Ca+ S–P lines, the hyperﬁne structure is signiﬁcantly larger
than the isotope shift, ﬁgure 1(b).

negligible at the low number densities involved here.
The inhomogeneous broadening (Doppler width) is de-
termined by the oven temperature, the collimation angle
of the atomic beam and the angle between the laser beam
and the atomic beam.

For orthogonal beams, the velocity distribution ap-
proximates to a Gaussian whose width compared with
that in the oven is determined by the collimation geom-
10.1]. For non-orthogonal
etry and the oven oriﬁce [22,
beams, the velocity distribution broadens and becomes
asymmetric, resulting in a broadening and shift when it
is convolved with the homogeneous proﬁle.

§

A. Alignment of the crossed beams

To ensure orthogonal alignment of the laser and atomic
beams, we minimize the width of the 423 nm ﬂuorescence
spectrum as a function of the angle between the beams.
The power of the 423 nm laser P423 is set safely below the
saturation level for maximum sensitivity (see next sec-
tion). A ﬂuorescence spectrum with the alignment opti-
mized is shown in ﬁgure 2, together with a simultaneously
acquired Doppler-free hollow cathode spectrum. From
several such spectra we ﬁnd that the oﬀset between the
40Ca ﬂuorescence peak and the hollow cathode saturated-
absorption peak is at most 10 MHz (after accounting for a
pressure red-shift of up to 13 MHz in the hollow cathode
lamp due to 6 torr of neon buﬀer gas [23]). This indicates
a beam misalignment of at most

12 mrad.

The ﬁtted Voigt proﬁle shown has Lorentzian full-
width at half-maximum (fwhm) 39 MHz and Gaussian
fwhm 52 MHz. The transit-time broadening is estimated
from the measured laser spot size and the approximate
atomic velocity (section III C) to be 2(1) MHz. The laser
linewidth estimated from the error signal when the laser
is locked to a stabilized reference cavity is 4(1) MHz. The
Gaussian width is consistent with the collimation aper-

B. Saturation broadening

It is important to avoid saturation broadening of the
423 nm transition. Since it is diﬃcult to estimate ab-
solute intensities accurately, and the atomic response is
averaged over the laser beam proﬁle, we studied the sat-
uration of the transition empirically, by varying the laser
power. Results, obtained after alignment of the crossed
beams, are shown in ﬁgure 3. Saturation eﬀects be-
gin, both in the peak ﬂuorescence and the Lorentzian
linewidth, above a laser power of about 10 µW.

The photo-ionization rate will increase as the popula-
tion of the 4s4p 1P1 state, i.e., linearly until saturation
sets in. Since the atomic beam is much larger than the
laser beam, however, the total number of atoms in the
upper state will continue to increase even well above sat-
uration, though more slowly with increasing power. The
isotope-selectivity will decrease roughly as the square of
the Lorentzian linewidth, for ﬁxed Gaussian width (the
wings of the Voigt proﬁle are determined overwhelmingly
by the Lorentzian component, for the Gaussian width
involved here). To maximize the photo-ionization rate
without sacriﬁcing isotope-selectivity, we work at powers
in the range 5–15 µW for photo-ionization loading.

whose expected positions are indicated. The dashed line
shows the best ﬁt when the 43Ca components are omitted

signal by 43Ca is about 22% of the total signal above back-
ground. Left inset: Fluorescence at 40Ca line centre from

due to the other isotopes are too small to be visible.

C. Number density and temperature in the atomic
beam

We can use the peak 40Ca ﬂuorescence at 423 nm to de-
duce the number density of calcium atoms in the atomic
beam, using the known line strength and the measured
photon collection eﬃciency. This in turn permits an esti-
mate of the absolute photo-ionization loading eﬃciency.
By measuring the number density as a function of oven
current we can also compare the eﬃciency of photo-
ionization trap loading with the electron bombardment
method (which have similar loading rates at very diﬀer-
ent oven currents).

The peak ﬂuorescence as a function of oven current
is shown in ﬁgure 4(a). The laser power was set below
saturation and under these conditions the peak corrected
photon count rate S is related to the number density N

ature which satisﬁes p = N0kT and the known vapour
pressure curve p = p(T ) simultaneously [25]. This is
shown in ﬁgure 4(b), and ranges between about 500 K
and 650 K. The temperature is useful for estimating the

of mass M : v = 433(4) m/s for 40Ca at T = 575(10) K.

density in the interaction region deduced from this ﬂuores-
cence rate as described in the text, and the error bars refer

quantitative estimate of this is diﬃcult since the angular
divergence depends on the sizes of the oven oriﬁce and the
trap capture region, neither of which is accurately known.
Instead, we investigate the actual photo-ionization load-
ing rate as a function of 423 nm detuning, as described
in the following section.

With the 423 nm beam well aligned orthogonal to the
atomic beam, and the laser power set below saturation,
we observe a linewidth of 76 MHz (fwhm), made up of
Lorentzian and Gaussian contributions of about 39 MHz
and 52 MHz respectively. This compares favourably with
the isotope shifts, table I. We do not use these data to
predict relative loading probabilities for the diﬀerent iso-
topes, however, since the collimation angle of the atomic
beam for loading the trap is greater than that relevant to
the 423 nm ﬂuorescence (l > l′) and the Gaussian contri-
bution to the linewidth will be correspondingly larger. A

IV. PHOTO-IONIZATION LOADING STUDIES

A. Expected form of photo-ionization cross-section

Calculations [26] of the cross-section Q for photo-
ionization from the 4s4p state suggest that, at 389 nm,
Q lies in the range 60–280 megabarns (1 megabarn =
10−22 m2). The large range results from the existence of
an auto-ionizing resonance close to the ionization thresh-
old, whose wavelength is uncertain to
5 nm. Since the
energy of the resonance is not well-known, we do not at-

∼

tempt to choose a particular laser wavelength, beyond
ensuring that it is below the threshold required for ion-
ization. The width of the resonance is certainly large
compared to the laser linewidth, so there is no need for
the laser to be carefully frequency-stabilized.

∼

The electric ﬁelds present in a Paul trap can allow ion-
ization to occur even for excitation slightly below the
continuum limit [3]. For the typical velocity estimated
above, atoms cross the photo-ionization laser beams in
0.2 µs and all atoms are thus able to sample the ex-
∼
trema of the r.f. ﬁeld (period 0.16 µs). The peak ﬁeld
105 V/m. A
varies across the trap, but is at most
rough estimate [27] of the eﬀect of such a ﬁeld on the
ionization threshold may be made by assuming a hydro-
e/4πǫ0x near the continuum
genic potential V (x) =
eEx) of the elec-
and equating this to the potential (
tron in the external ﬁeld E; the result is that the ion-
ization limit could be shifted at the furthest to a wave-
length of 391.3 nm. However, no signiﬁcant enhancement
of the photo-ionization cross-section is expected by using
wavelengths closer to this shifted ionization limit, even
for monochromatic light, because the oscillatory electric
ﬁeld blurs out the discrete energy levels of the atom near
the continuum and the average transition probability is
no higher than that within the continuum [28,

18.6].

B. Photo-ionization loading rate measurements

A typical photo-ionization loading curve is shown in
ﬁgure 5, where the ﬂuorescence at 397 nm from cold
40Ca+ ions in the trap is plotted as a function of time
after the photo-ionizing lasers are switched on. As the
size of the ion crystal grows, the ﬂuorescence per ion
increases due to the eﬀect of r.f. micromotion for ions ly-
ing oﬀ-axis, because they spend time closer to resonance
with the red-detuned 397 nm cooling laser. However, for
the range of crystal sizes in these experiments, the ﬂuo-
rescence per ion is roughly constant and we use the ﬁnal
ﬂuorescence level as a measure of the total number of ions
loaded. (The ﬂuorescence was calibrated after a typical
load by reducing the trap strength until the ions could
be counted on the camera.) For each load, we wait a few
seconds after the photo-ionizing lasers are switched oﬀ,
to allow any hot ions to be cooled and to join the crystal,
check that the ions are still crystalline using the cam-
era, and then take the ﬁnal number of ions m divided by
the duration τ of exposure to the photo-ionizing lasers
as our measure of the loading rate R. We ﬁnd that an
error √m/τ is broadly consistent with variations in the
loading rate taken under nominally identical conditions
(see for example ﬁgure 6).

We have studied the loading rate as a function of the
power P423 and detuning ∆423 of the 423 nm laser, and
of the power P389 of the 389 nm laser. This was done
at ﬁxed oven current, to keep the atomic number den-
sity as constant as possible. For each measurement, the
397 nm ﬂuorescence was allowed to increase to a level rep-

The 423 nm and 389 nm photo-ionizing lasers are switched
on at t = 0 and oﬀ at t = 216 s (dotted line). The 397 nm
and 866 nm cooling lasers illuminate the ions continuously.
Background counts due to scattered 397 nm light and (dur-
ing the loading) 423 nm ﬂuorescence and 389 nm light have
been subtracted from the PMT signal. The step in 397 nm
ﬂuorescence when the ﬁrst cold ion appears is arrowed. The
large steps in the ﬂuorescence are typical and may result from
the details of the cooling dynamics as the number of ions in
the trap increases. The dashed line indicates the ﬁnal ﬂuo-
rescence level, which corresponds to 36(3) ions; the average
loading rate of 0.17(3) ion/s is obtained by dividing this by the
time for which the photo-ionizing lasers are switched on. The
conditions were: oven current 4.25 A, P423∼ 6 µW, ∆423 =
0(5) MHz, P389 = 0.93(9) µW, ∆397 = −68(10) MHz.

resenting about 40 trapped ions, whereupon the photo-
ionizing lasers were blocked. In practice, the number of
ions loaded varied between 22(2) and 63(5); the length
of photo-ionizing exposure was between 2 s and 600 s.

Figure 6 shows the dependence of loading rate on
423 nm power and detuning. Note that the loading rate
could in principle saturate at a diﬀerent power level to the
423 nm ﬂuorescence studied above, since photo-ionization
is limited by the width of the 389 nm beam (the lifetime
of the 4s4p 1P1 level, 4.49(4) ns, is much shorter than
the time an atom spends in the laser beams,
0.2 µs)
whereas the ﬂuorescence collected is limited by the imag-
ing aperture. Nevertheless, we observe that the loading
rate also starts to saturate above a power of P423
10 µW
due to saturation of the upper state population. Given
the power available in the 423 nm laser, the maximum
loading rate could be made perhaps an order of mag-
nitude larger by increasing the spot size at the trap to
1 mm; spot sizes much larger than this, however, would
start to reduce the isotope-selectivity because of the in-

FIG. 7: Photo-ionization loading rate as a function of 389 nm
laser power, with: oven current 4.25 A, P423∼ 6 µW, ∆423 =
0(5) MHz, ∆397 = −68(10) MHz. No signiﬁcant diﬀerence in
eﬃciency is observed even when the laser is well below lasing
threshold (vertical dashed line), indicating that the photo-
ionization cross-section is independent of the spectral width
of the laser. A straight line (y ∝ x) is ﬁtted to the data. The
single measurement with the ultraviolet LED in place of the
389 nm laser is also included (see section IV D).

In contrast to the 423 nm bound-bound transition, no
saturation eﬀect is expected for the 389 nm bound-free
ionizing transition, and this is veriﬁed for the 389 nm
powers we can attain (ﬁgure 7): the dependence of the
loading rate on P389 is linear over two orders of mag-
nitude. Signiﬁcantly, there is no change in eﬃciency
whether the 389 nm laser is running above or below las-
ing threshold, despite the fact that the spectral width
is expected to be about ﬁve orders of magnitude larger

in this region.

C. Absolute photo-ionization eﬃciency

We can deduce a lower limit for the photo-ionization
cross-section from the loading rate under conditions of
near-saturation on the 423 nm transition, when we ex-
pect that nearly half the atoms are in the 4s4p 1P1 upper
level (at least across that part of the 423 nm beam which
overlaps the 389 nm beam). From the deﬁnition of the
photo-ionization cross-section Q, the number of atoms

geometry relevant to loading.

creasing atomic beam divergence angle.

The loading rate as a function of ∆423 is of critical
importance for isotope-selective loading. We expect the
dependence to be modelled by a Voigt proﬁle with sim-
ilar Lorentzian width to that of the 423 nm ﬂuorescence
spectrum, but diﬀerent Gaussian width because of the
diﬀerent atomic beam collimation angles for ﬂuorescence
detection and ion loading. The Lorentzian and Gaussian
widths are not well-determined if they are both ﬂoated,
due to the noise in the data, so we ﬁx the Lorentzian
width at 39 MHz, from the ﬂuorescence spectrum in ﬁg-
ure 2, and ﬁnd a ﬁtted Gaussian width of 71 MHz. This
Gaussian width is consistent with a beam collimation an-
gle deﬁned by the electrodes and an oven oriﬁce of size
1 mm. The consequent isotope-selectivity expected is

(equation 1), justifying the assumption of saturation.
The loading rate was measured to be R = 4.9(9) ion/s
with P389 = 1.1(1) µW, giving a cross-section Q =
170(60) megabarns. This is a lower limit since it assumes
that every ion produced is trapped and that the capture
region of the trap extends across the full width of the
atomic beam as far as the r.f. electrodes, but it lies in
the anticipated range (section IV A).

Alternatively, the loading rate can be expressed in
terms of the probability q per atom of being ionized (and
trapped) as it crosses the interaction region:

D. Loading using an ultraviolet LED

The observation that the 389 nm laser is able to photo-
ionize atoms just as eﬃciently below lasing threshold led
us to experiment with an alternative light source for the
second step of the photo-ionization, an ultraviolet light-
emitting diode (LED). The device tested was a Nichia
NSHU590 diode, with nominal output power 500 µW,
peak wavelength 375 nm and spectral width 12 nm. The
chief advantages of this device are that it is about three
orders of magnitude cheaper than a wavelength-selected
ultraviolet laser diode, and does not require temperature
and current stabilization. Measurements with a grat-
ing spectrograph indicated that the peak wavelength was
in fact between 375 nm and 390 nm, depending which
part of the emission region was focussed on the spectro-
graph slit, and the spectral width was
25 nm; however
at least half of the spectral intensity lies in the range
λ < 389.8 nm useful for photo-ionization. The main
drawback of the LED is its extended emission region:
it is diﬃcult to focus a large fraction of the power into
a region smaller than a few millimetres, unlike a laser
beam.

∼

When we ﬁrst tested the LED in place of the 389 nm
laser we were surprised to ﬁnd that it was capable of load-
ing ions into the trap while the 423 nm laser was blocked
and the oven was switched oﬀ! A small number of 40Ca+
ions were loaded, together with several “dark” ions; at

9

∼

∼

the same time we noticed that the stray d.c. electric ﬁeld
in the trap changed by
10%, drifting gradually back
to its former value over a period of an hour or so. Our
interpretation is that the large (
5 mm) patch of light
from the LED was irradiating the r.f. electrodes, ablat-
ing and photo-ionizing calcium and other ions from the
surface where they had previously been deposited by the
atomic beam. Photo-electric emission could be respon-
sible for charging insulating patches on the electrodes,
causing the stray ﬁeld to change temporarily before the
charge leaks away (the photo-electric cut-oﬀ wavelength
for calcium is 433 nm). Surface ablation is a well-known
method of loading ion traps [29], though it is perhaps
surprising at the low light intensities involved here.

To avoid this problem, we imaged the LED onto a
200 µm pinhole, which was re-imaged at approximately
1:1 magniﬁcation into the trap region, and overlapped
with the 423 nm beam. This eliminated loading of
non-40Ca+ ions and eﬀects on the stray ﬁeld, but only
0.32(3) µWof ultraviolet power was then available at
the trap. The loading rate under these conditions,
0.06(1) ion/s, is plotted in ﬁgure 7 and is similar to that
expected with comparable 389 nm laser power. This rate
is not suﬃcient for loading the rarer isotopes, where it
is necessary to beat losses due to charge-exchange (sec-
tion V B), but is perfectly adequate for loading small
crystals of 40Ca+. We note that high-power (
150 mW)
ultraviolet LEDs are also available, though their cost ap-
proaches that of a laser diode.

V.

ISOTOPE-SELECTIVE LOADING

A. Expected selectivity

From the data in ﬁgure 6(b) we expect good isotope-
selectivity, because the net fwhm, 94 MHz, is small com-
pared with the isotope shifts in the 423 nm transition.
This discrimination has to be set against the very low
abundance of some isotopes. In ﬁgure 8 we plot the cal-
culated probability of loading the diﬀerent isotopes as
a function of detuning ∆423, based on the ﬁtted Voigt
proﬁle in ﬁgure 6(b). We regard the loading as “isotope-
selective” for those isotopes where there exists a detun-
ing at which one is more likely to load the desired iso-
tope than any other; it can be seen from ﬁgure 8 that
this is the case for all isotopes except 43Ca+ and 46Ca+.
The most demanding case is 46Ca+, where the maximum
achievable loading probability, relative to the total load-
ing probability, is only 6.0%. The relative probability of
loading 43Ca+ is also plotted in the ﬁgure: it reaches a
maximum of 21% at a detuning of 0.623 GHz. This com-
pares with a theoretical maximum of 33% which would
be possible with a Lorentzian width equal to the natural
linewidth and negligible Gaussian width; thus not a great
deal would be gained by eﬀorts to collimate further the
atomic beam.

The detunings of the Doppler-cooling lasers also aﬀect

then rare ions already trapped are replaced by 40Ca+
faster than subsequent ones can be loaded. If the charge-
exchange rate is suﬃciently fast, then rare ions will not
even be cooled before they are replaced, and the trap will
ﬁll up with 40Ca+ before any ﬂuorescence signal from the
rare ions is seen.

In practice we ﬁnd that, providing one is not attempt-
ing to load large crystals, charge-exchange is only a limi-
tation for the rarest isotope 46Ca+. For the typical load-
ing parameters used for loading 43Ca+, for example, the
loading rate is
1 ion/s while the lifetime against loss
1 min. 46Ca+ is about thirty
due to charge-exchange is
times less abundant, so we expect the loss rate to ap-
proach the loading rate under the same conditions.

∼

∼

We note that the charge-exchange process was used
by Mortensen et al. [2] to demonstrate isotope-selective
loading, but that they were not attempting to retain and
to laser-cool the diﬀerent isotopes; instead they relied on
charge-exchange to replace every isotope by 40Ca+ and
used the resulting 40Ca+ ﬂuorescence as a measure of the
original load size.

C. Even isotopes

Loading one of the even isotopes consists of choosing
the 423 nm detuning for maximum selectivity and set-
ting the appropriate detunings of the 397 nm and 866 nm
lasers used for Doppler-cooling. After loading, we can
check for the presence of other isotopes by looking for ﬂu-
orescence using diﬀerent detunings of the cooling lasers
(the lasers are blocked while the detunings are changed,
to avoid possible heating). Phase-sensitive detection with
a chopped 866 nm beam can be used to detect very small
ﬂuorescence signals above scattered 397 nm background
light.

∼

As expected from ﬁgure 8 we can load small, pure crys-
tals of 44Ca+ and 48Ca+ (and of course 40Ca+) without
diﬃculty. Predicted peak loading probabilities of 44Ca+
and 48Ca+ are 94% and 85% respectively. Practical load-
ing rates can be achieved in spite of the small abundances
100 µW) and by in-
by using maximum 389 nm power (
creasing the oven current. We concentrate here on the
more challenging cases of 42Ca+ (which lies closest to
40Ca+) and 46Ca+ (which is extremely rare).

19 42Ca+ ions and only

The maximum expected probability of loading 42Ca+
is 58%, at a detuning ∆423 = 0.394 GHz, with 40Ca+ by
far the dominant impurity. However, when we loaded
using this detuning, we obtained a crystal consisting of
5 40Ca+ ions, i.e., a loading
∼
∼
eﬃciency of about 80%. We attribute this to the mech-
anism mentioned above, that the 397 nm laser was blue-
detuned from the 40Ca+ transition by about 350 MHz,
thus tending to heat this species and expel it from the
trap; the 40Ca+ ions are only cooled sympathetically by
the 42Ca+ [30]. This mixed-species crystal also illustrates
the typical charge-exchange rates: after
20 min, with
the photo-ionizing lasers blocked but the oven left on at

ﬁgure 6(b) (except that the Gaussian width is adjusted to
take account of the diﬀerent isotopic masses). The dashed

three hyperﬁne components have been summed), are labelled
by the mass numbers. The thick solid curve is the sum of
the contributions from all the isotopes. The detached solid

region where this quantity is > 0.05.

the selectivity, due to the isotope shifts in the ionic transi-
tions (table I). For example, to cool 42Ca+ eﬃciently, the
397 nm laser needs to be detuned
350 MHz to the blue
of the 40Ca+ transition, which will tend to heat 40Ca+
ions and expel them from the trap, thus enhancing the
selectivity.

∼

B. Charge-exchange loss

It is possible for an ion X Ca+ which has been loaded
into the trap to undergo charge-exchange with a neutral
atom in the atomic beam; since the overwhelming prob-
ability is that the neutral atom is 40Ca the process is
usually:

X Ca+ + 40Ca

X Ca + 40Ca+

→
and the original ion in the trap is replaced by 40Ca+.
The charge-exchange rate is proportional to the number
density in the atomic beam. This process is a limitation
for loading more than one ion of a rare isotope: if the loss
rate through charge-exchange exceeds the loading rate,

∼

4.25 A, the number of 40Ca+ ions had increased to

and there was only a very low signal visible at the 42Ca+
detunings; after a further 30 min, there was no detectable
signal from 42Ca+. This indicates that the lifetime (per

ion) against loss by charge-exchange is

0.1 ion/s, with a sacriﬁce of a factor

The 0.004%-abundant 46Ca+ is the most diﬃcult iso-
tope to load, with an expected peak loading probabil-
ity of 6.0% (neglecting enhancement by heating as ob-
served for 42Ca+). To achieve the maximum photo-
ionization rate without excessive saturation-broadening
of the 423 nm transition, we set P423

100 µW) and increased the
maximum 389 nm power (

oven current to 5.0 A. Using the measured loading rates
for 40Ca and the number density data we expect a 46Ca+
loading rate of

in selectivity because of the high 423 nm power. Under
these conditions, a ﬂuorescence signal was detected af-
ter
17 s of exposure to the photo-ionizing lasers. The
oven was switched oﬀ immediately to prevent charge-
exchange. The ions could not be made to crystallize,
however, indicating that too many impurity ions were
present to be cooled sympathetically by the 46Ca+. We
therefore applied a “tickle” voltage to one of the trap
end-caps, close to the axial resonance frequency, which is
less likely to expel the directly-cooled 46Ca+ than other
isotopes. Crystallization was then observed, ﬁgure 9, and
camera images implied that the crystal consisted of a sin-
gle 46Ca+ ion and several impurity ions (most probably
40Ca+). The observed isotope shift in the 866 nm transi-
tion was
6.4(2) GHz; although this particular shift has
not been measured before, it is in agreement with that
expected (table I) and thus conﬁrms the identity of the
ion.

D. Odd isotope

The laser requirements for Doppler-cooling 43Ca+ are
more demanding than for the even isotopes because of the
hyperﬁne structure, ﬁgure 1(b). In particular, a separate
repumper is necessary on one of the ultraviolet transi-
tions because of the large (3.2 GHz) hyperﬁne splitting
between the S3

loaded 40Ca+ as well; this indicates that we achieve sig-

ing probability of only 21%, presumably because 40Ca+
ions are heated by the 393 nm laser and expelled from
the trap. The maximum ﬂuorescence rate detected from
a single 43Ca+ ion was 23000 s−1, compared with typ-
ically 32000 s−1 for 40Ca+ (a reduction attributable to
less eﬃcient repumping from the D states).

To conﬁrm the identity of the ﬁrst single ion we loaded
by this method, we scanned the frequency of the 397 nm
repumper: at low intensity, the two hyperﬁne compo-
nents S3
1/2 are well-resolved, ﬁg-
ure 10, and have the expected separation. As a further
check, the axial resonance frequency was measured and

If the photo-ionizing lasers and oven are left on for
longer we ﬁnd that we load crystals containing about 50%
43Ca+ and 50% 40Ca+. This may occur either because of
charge-exchange, or because once 43Ca+ is trapped and
cooled, it can cool 40Ca+ sympathetically in spite of the
heating eﬀect of the 393 nm laser. We discovered that it
was possible to purify such mixed crystals by temporar-
ily blocking the 397 nm ultraviolet repumper; when this
laser is blocked a small ﬂuorescence signal is still visi-
ble from 43Ca+ (because of oﬀ-resonant repumping on
S3
3/2 by the 3 GHz-detuned 393 nm laser) but
1/2 ↔
there is no longer any laser capable of cooling 40Ca+ di-
rectly. We assist the 40Ca+ heating by switching on the
866 nm repumper, tuned to be resonant with the 40Ca+
transition. One might expect the Coulomb coupling be-
tween the diﬀerent species to make this puriﬁcation pro-
cess rather ineﬃcient, but we found on the contrary that
it always seems successful at removing the 40Ca+ ions
without loss of any 43Ca+. For example, a mixed crystal
consisting of three 43Ca+ ions and eight 40Ca+ ions was
puriﬁed completely by blocking the 397 nm repumper for
8 s. The technique can also be applied during loading:
∼
with the oven and photo-ionizing lasers on, we watch the
43Ca+ ions being loaded on the camera and, as soon as
there is evidence of “dark ions” in the trap, block the
397 nm repumper for a few seconds to purify the crystal,
then un-block it to continue loading. In this way, pure
43Ca+ crystals of arbitrary size can be loaded; the inset
of ﬁgure 10 shows a 9-ion linear crystal.

VI. PHOTO-IONIZATION AND ELECTRON
BOMBARDMENT COMPARED

The limitations of electron bombardment ionization
are discussed in [3]. A signiﬁcant problem in our ap-
paratus was the eﬀect of ﬁring the electron gun on the
stray electric ﬁelds in the trap. After loading, the static
ﬁeld necessary to compensate the micromotion of the ions
was found to decay exponentially with a time constant
6 hours. For the typical load shown in ﬁgure 11(a)
∼
the vertical stray ﬁeld would not have been stable to
the 1 V/m resolution of our compensation method until

laser is scanned. The 397 nm intensity was reduced to
∼ 0.2 mW/mm2 for this scan, to reduce the widths of the
peaks. A double Lorentzian is ﬁtted to the data: the sepa-
ration between the two components is 582(6) MHz (where a
1% error is allowed in deducing the frequency scale from a
confocal cavity of 300 MHz free spectral range), in excellent
agreement with the known hyperﬁne splitting in the P1/2 level
of 581 MHz. The S3
1/2 component has been assigned
the known shift of −1381 MHz relative to 40Ca+. Inset: A

ing of the 397 nm repumper to remove even-isotope impurity
ions, as described in the text. The separation between the
closest ions is 13(1) µm.

28 hours after the trap was loaded. We ascribe this
∼
drift to charge on insulating parts of the trap structure
which decays with time, and have not observed this sys-
tematic decay after photo-ionization loading. On longer
timescales, between loads, we observed that the vertical
stray ﬁeld changed by up to
200 V/m; this is compared
∼
with recent photo-ionization compensation data in ﬁg-
ure 11(b). The cause of these long-term changes in the
stray ﬁeld could have been changes in the distribution of
material deposited on the trap electrodes when the oven
or electron gun was ﬁred: calcium deposited on the stain-
less steel r.f. electrodes could give rise to static ﬁelds of
this magnitude, due to the diﬀerence in work functions
between these two metals.

This highlights a further issue: based on the work
of the NIST Ion Storage group, we expect that mate-
rial deposited onto the trap electrodes from the oven
and/or electron gun will contribute signiﬁcantly to mo-
tional heating of trapped ions in the sub-Doppler cool-
ing regime relevant to quantum logic experiments [4, 32].

The estimates of calcium number density and temper-
ature in the atomic beam given in section III C, above,
109 atom/s/mm2 on a surface normal
imply a ﬂux of
to the atomic beam, at the 6 A oven current which was
necessary for loading the trap using electron bombard-
ment. For the same loading rate, this can be reduced
by over four orders of magnitude using photo-ionization.
Furthermore, the same photo-ionization loading rate can
be maintained even when using a well-collimated atomic
beam designed to prevent deposition of atoms on the trap
structure.

∼

∼

With maximum power in both photo-ionizing lasers,
we measured a loading rate of 1.6(2) ion/s at an oven cur-
rent of 3.25 A. This compares with an electron bombard-
ment loading rate of
1 ion/s at an oven current of 6.0 A.
Extrapolating the number density data of ﬁgure 4(a) to
6.0 A oven current indicates that photo-ionization is a
104 times more eﬃcient than our electron
factor of
bombardment ionization setup. A further two orders
of magnitude enhancement of the loading eﬃciency in
this apparatus would be available by (i) increasing the
spot sizes of the photo-ionizing lasers to reduce satura-
tion eﬀects on the 423 nm transition and (ii) eliminating
the optical ﬁbre in the 389 nm beam. We note, how-
ever, that the per atom eﬃciency of photo-ionization trap
loading can be approached by techniques of surface ion-
ization [33].

The photo-ionization method overcomes the limita-
tions of electron bombardment ionization: the species-
and isotope-selectivity ensure that unwanted ions are not
trapped and furthermore allow studies of rare isotopes
without enriched sources; there is negligible eﬀect due to
1 V/m
the loading on the stray ﬁelds (at the level of
in this trap);
it works well irrespective of radial trap
strength [3], so that compensation of stray ﬁelds for dif-
ferent trap conditions is unnecessary; the high eﬃciency
of photo-ionization means that the ﬂux of the atomic
beam can be attenuated by many orders of magnitude
which reduces immensely problems associated with de-
position of material on the trap structure. These advan-
tages must be weighed against the complexities of two
additional lasers, compared with an electron gun inside
the vacuum system.

VII. CONCLUSION

FIG. 11: (a) Drift of the stray ﬁeld versus time after load-
ing with electron bombardment ionization. The magnitude
of the vertical ﬁeld required to compensate horizontal ion mi-
cromotion is plotted. The micromotion compensation here
was performed by minimizing the width of the S1/2 ↔ P1/2
spectrum; we assign an error of ±3 V/m. An exponential
decay function is ﬁtted to the data (solid line); this has time-
constant 6.3(7) hours and amplitude 88(4) V/m. No such drift
is visible after loading by photo-ionization, at the 1 V/m level.
(b) Variation of the steady-state stray ﬁeld versus time, over
the course of nearly a year for electron bombardment load-
ing (squares, left) and over the course of 45 days for photo-
ionization loading (circles, right). Each point is taken from a
diﬀerent load. For the electron bombardment data the error
bar represents the estimated additional drift possible after the
ﬁnal compensation measurement. For the photo-ionization
data, the estimated error in compensating the stray ﬁeld is
1 V/m; the standard deviation of the data set is 2.8 V/m, indi-
cating some residual systematic variation (which may be due
to the remaining atomic beam ﬂux, or mechanical variations
in the trap geometry over time).

We have presented quantitative studies of photo-
ionization ion-trap loading for calcium ions, using the
ﬂuorescence from the neutral atoms to estimate the ab-
solute eﬃciency of this process. We ﬁnd that, in our
trap, this loading method is around four orders of mag-
nitude more eﬃcient than conventional electron impact
ionization, comparably to Gulde et al. [3], and does not
give rise to stray electric ﬁelds. We have shown that the
setup of Gulde et al. may be further simpliﬁed by elim-
inating frequency-stabilization for the 389 nm laser and,
if high loading rates are not required, by replacing this

laser with a light-emitting diode. We have optimized the
photo-ionization procedure for the purposes of isotope-
selection, demonstrating trapping of all the naturally oc-
curring isotopes from a natural abundance source. The
rare species 43Ca+ and 46Ca+ have been laser-cooled for
the ﬁrst time.

The odd isotope 43Ca+ is of particular interest for ex-
periments in quantum information processing and optical
frequency standards, and we have demonstrated the abil-
ity to load pure crystals of this ion. We note, however,
that an enriched source would still be advantageous for

work with this isotope, since it would reduce any remain-
ing deposition of material from the atomic beam on the
trap electrodes to the minimum possible. An interesting
feature of photo-ionization compared with electron bom-
bardment ionization is that the laser beams allow it to be
spatially-selective: this could be useful for loading spe-
ciﬁc traps in proposed quantum computing architectures
involving microtrap arrays [34]. The spatial selectivity
could be extended to three dimensions by crossing the
423 nm and 389 nm beams. The isotope-selectivity would
also be invaluable for loading “refrigerator” ions [35] in
schemes where continuous cooling is provided by one iso-
tope, while quantum logic operations are carried out us-
ing another isotope: following the estimate in [29], the de-
coherence rate, due to oﬀ-resonant photon scattering, of
a 43Ca+ qubit being cooled sympathetically by a 42Ca+
refrigerator ion is
0.1/s for a trap with a heating rate
∼
of 103 motional quanta per second [4].

Finally, in comparison with the work of Mortensen et
al., it is clear that the 272 nm 4s2 1S0 ↔
4s5p 1P1 transi-
tion is much more favourable for isotope-selective ion-
ization of calcium than the 423 nm transition used in
this work, since it possesses a narrower natural width,
8.5(5) MHz [17], and isotope shifts about a factor of two
larger [2]. However, this scheme requires a signiﬁcantly
more complex laser source than the blue diode laser used
here, and is somewhat less eﬃcient since it involves ex-

14

citation deeper into the continuum. An unfortunate cir-
cumstance at the time of writing is the unavailability of
further diodes at 423 nm from Nichia Corporation but
we are optimistic that, with blue laser diodes under de-
velopment by several other manufacturers and research
laboratories, the situation will improve.

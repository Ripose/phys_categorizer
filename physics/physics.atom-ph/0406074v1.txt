We survey results on the creation of heteronuclear Fermi molecules by tuning a degenerate Bose-
Fermi mixture into the neighborhood of an association resonance, either photoassociation or Fes-
hbach, as well as the subsequent prospects for Cooper-like pairing between atoms and molecules.
In the simplest case of only one molecular state, corresponding to either a Feshbach resonance or
one-color photoassociation, the system displays Rabi oscillations and rapid adiabatic passage be-
tween a Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms and fermionic molecules. For two-color photoassociation, the
system admits stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) from a Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms
to stable Fermi molecules, even in the presence of particle-particle interactions. By tailoring the
STIRAP sequence it is possible to deliberately convert only a fraction of the initial atoms, leaving
a ﬁnite fraction of bosons behind to induce atom-molecule Cooper pairing via density ﬂuctuations;
unfortunately, this enhancement is insuﬃcient to achieve a superﬂuid transition with present ul-
tracold technology. We therefore propose the use of an association resonance that converts atoms
and diatomic molecules (dimers) into triatomic molecules (trimers), which leads to a crossover from
a Bose-Einstein condensate of trimers to atom-dimer Cooper pairs. Because heteronuclear dimers
may possess a permanent electric dipole moment, this overall system presents an opportunity to
investigate novel microscopic physics.

INTRODUCTION

It has recently come to the fore that collective as-
sociation can actually produce a quantum degenerate
molecules, serving as a compliment to the development
of buﬀer-gas cooling [1] and Stark-deceleration [2] tech-
niques. The trail to molecular Bose-Einstein conden-
sate (BEC) was pioneered by experiments [3] with pho-
toassociation of 87Rb condensate that were just on the
verge [4] of coherent atom-molecule conversion. Next-
generation experiments were aimed at the strongly inter-
acting regime [5, 6], and probed the predicted [4, 7, 8]
photoassociation rate limit. As of late,
laser experi-
ments [9] have conﬁrmed [4, 10, 11] an optically tunable
BEC scattering length, no small feat in the face of rapid
spontaneous decay. Meanwhile, groundbreaking magne-
toassociation experiments demonstrated a magnetically
tunable scattering length [12, 13], and led to the con-
trolled collapse of a condensate with atom bursts em-
anating from remnant condensate [14]. Subsequent co-
herent oscillations between burst and remnant [15] were
interpreted as evidence for atom-molecule coherence [16,
17, 18, 19]. In the search for the neutral-atom analogue
of superconducting Cooper pairs of electrons [20, 21], ul-
tracold [22, 23, 24] and condensate [25, 26, 27] molecules
were unambiguously created via magnetoassociation of
fermionic atoms [28, 29, 30]. Similarly, quantum degen-
erate molecules have been observed and characterized in
magnetoassociation of atomic BEC [31].

Collective association is a general theory to describe

a quantum-degenerate gas tuned near a photoassocia-
tion or Feshbach resonance. The former is a resonance
where two colliding atoms absorb a photon and jump
to a bound molecular state [32], whereas the latter is
a resonance where one atom from a colliding pair spin
ﬂips in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld [33, 34], known
aﬀectionately as magnetoassociation. Some of the ﬁrst
theoretical investigations into association of a quantum
degenerate gas pointed to strongly enhanced molecule
formation [35, 36], and a focus on Bose-Einstein con-
densates [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43] in particular led
to the idea of Bose-enhanced molecule production [44],
or so-called superchemistry [45]. However, it soon be-
came clear that this idea applied equally well to de-
generate Fermi and Bose-Fermi mixtures, indicating the
possibility for changes in statistics, i.e., creating Bose
molecules from Fermi mixtures [46, 47, 48, 49, 52] or
Fermi molecules from Bose-Fermi mixtures [50, 51], and
thereby taking superchemistry to a new level. Moreover,
collective association [54] of Bose-Fermi mixtures [55] in
particular oﬀers a convenient source of ultracold polar
molecules, which can be used for quantum computa-
tion [57] and searches for the standard-model-violating
electric dipole moment of the electron [58].

So motivated, our attention has therefore turned to
resonant association in Bose-Fermi mixtures of atoms,
and the subsequent possibility of atom-molecule Cooper
pairing. While the Raman formation of ground state
Fermi molecules appears feasible in practice [52], the sub-
sequent oﬀ-resonant transition to a superﬂuid of atom-

molecule Cooper pairs occurs out of reach of present ul-
tracold technology [52]; hence, an association resonance
for trimers is apparently necessary to experimentally re-
alize atom-dimer Cooper pairing [53]. The purpose of
this article is to survey our results on collective Fermi
molecule formation, in order to highlight future research
avenues in the physics of quantum degenerate dipolar
gases.

The survey herein is outlined as follows.

In Sec. II,
we discuss the broad features of converting a degenerate
Bose-Fermi mixture into Fermi molecules via a collec-
tive association resonance, in particular Rabi-like oscil-
lation and rapid adiabatic passage. In Sec. III, the focus
is on the formation of stable Fermi molecules with Ra-
man photoassociation of a Bose-Fermi mixture, and the
subsequent possibility for boson-induced Cooper pairing
between atoms and molecules, where Raman photoas-
sociation converts a fraction of the initial mixture into
molecules and the leftover bosons enhance the atom-
molecule interaction. Since this enhancement is insuf-
ﬁcient to induce pairing within reach of present ultra-
cold technology, Sec. IV explores the possibility of driving
atom-molecule Cooper pairing with an association reso-
nance that converts atom-dimer pairs into trimers, i.e., a
crossover from a BEC of trimers to atom-dimer Cooper
pairs. Besides a summary, Sec. V identiﬁes some open
questions regarding dipolar particle interactions.

II. SHORTCUT TO DEGENERATE FERMI
MOLECULES VIA COLLECTIVE ASSOCIATION

Analogous with coherent optical transients in few level
atomic systems [59], photoassociation of a BEC has been
predicted to induce Rabi-like oscillations between atomic
and molecular condensates [38, 39, 45], whereby an en-
tire gas of, say, two million Bose-condensed atoms are
collectively converted into a million molecules that are,
in turn, collectively converted back into (roughly) two
million atoms, ad inﬁnitum. Another interesting possi-
bility arises because the ground state of the system is all
atoms for large positive detunings (far below threshold)
and all molecules for large negative detunings (far above
threshold), so that a slow sweep of the laser detuning
from one extreme to the other will collectively convert a
BEC of atoms into a BEC of molecules [38]. Incidentally,
it was a particular combination of these two concepts,
applied instead to magnetoassociation, that led to the
observation[15] of collective Ramsey fringes between an
atomic condensate and a small fraction of molecular con-
densate dressed by dissociated atom pairs [16, 17, 18, 19].
Given a degenerate mixture of Bose and Fermi gases [55],
will similar coherent phenomena manifest in free-bound
association degenerate Fermi molecules?

To address this question, we model an ideal degen-
erate Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms coupled by either
a Feshbach or photoassociation resonance to a Fermi-
degenerate gas of molecules. But ﬁrst we make some

2

simpliﬁcations to allow for ease of modeling. First, by
making a proper [50] unitary transformation, any explicit
chemical potential can be absorbed into the detuning
and forgotten. Second, collective association occurs on a
timescale much faster than trapped-atom motion, allow-
ing neglect of the kinetic energies, and justifying omission
of an explicit trap. Third, any Fermi energies lie within
the Wigner threshold regime, so that the coupling
can
be taken as the same for all modes. Finally, we work
in momentum space, but retain only the k = 0 conden-
sate modes since Bose stimulation favors these transitions
over k

= 0 modes. The simpliﬁed Hamiltonian reads

where c annihilates a condensate atom, ak (bk) annihi-
lates an atom (molecule) with wavevector k, and κ =
/√V .From the Heisenberg equations of motion for an on-
K
resonance system (δ = 0) [50], it is easy to show that
for equal numbers of bosonic and fermionic atoms, NB =
NF = N , the system that evolves with the character-
istic frequency Ω = √N κ. Using Fock states, said in-
tuition is conﬁrmed by solving the Schr¨odinger equation
numerically, the results of which are shown in Fig. 1.
For the two-body case (N = 1), a complete oscillation
between Fermi-Bose atoms and Fermi molecules occurs
in a time 2π/Ω. However, for N = 5 quantum many-
body ﬂuctuations not only frustrate complete conversion,
but also shift the oscillation frequency and lead to col-
lapse and revival. Increasing the initial particle number
to N = 10 gives better short-time agreement with the

two-body result. This behavior is exactly analogous to
the single-component bosonic case [38, 39]. Although
limited computational resources preclude explicit inves-
tigation, based on the bosonic analogy [38, 39] we fully
expect the ﬁrst half oscillation to be complete for large
particle number.

−

From the Hamiltonian (1), it should also be clear that
the system will favor all atoms for large positive detun-
ings, while favoring all molecules for large negative de-
tunings. With Ω established as the characteristic fre-
quency for collective atom-molecule conversion, changes
in the detuning that are of the order of Ω, and occur
over a time of order Ω−1, should qualify as adiabatic.
Hence, if the detuning is swept in a linear fashion ac-
ξΩ2t, then dimensionless sweep rates
cording to δ =
ξ . 1 should enable rapid adiabatic passage to degen-
erate Fermi molecules. Our suspicions are again corrob-
orated by a Fock-state-based numerical solution to the
Schr¨odinger equation, shown in Fig. 2. While many-
body eﬀects appear to rather seriously aﬀect the eﬃ-
ciency of a marginally adiabatic sweep (ξ = 1) compared
to the N = 1 case, the diﬀerence between N = 5 and
N = 10 (not shown) is in fact small. Overall, many-
body eﬀects are expected to be weak for near-adiabatic
1), and vanishing for sweeps that are deep-
sweeps (ξ
adiabatic (ξ . 0.1), again in agreement with our BEC
experience [38].

For an estimate of explicit numbers we eschew pho-
toassociation because of the losses associated with the
electronically-excited state, and focus on the atom-
molecule coupling provided by the Feshbach resonance
located at B0 = 534 G [61], which has a width ∆R = 4 G
and an associated zero-ﬁeld Fermi-Bose-atom scatter-

molecule coupling is
(4π
0.14 cm3/2 s−1, where we have estimated the diﬀerence
between the Fermi-Bose atom pair and molecular mag-
netic moments to be equal to the Bohr magneton µBohr.
Assuming NB = 105 condensate atoms in a trap with
respective radial and axial frequencies ωr/2π = 215 Hz
and ωa/2π = 16.3 Hz [56], the density of bosons is ρB =
1013 cm−3. As for the fermions, we assume a modest
8.1
number, say, NF = 103, which has three consequences:
(i) the atomic BEC will act as a reservoir, thus absorb-
ing any heat created by holes in the Fermi sea [62]; (ii)
barring an unfortunately large scattering length for Bose-
atom and Fermi-molecule collisions, we can neglect the
possibility of any Fermi-Bose collapse instabilities [56];
(iii) the size of the Fermi cloud (RF = 8.3 µm) is smaller
than the BEC (RB = 10 µm), so that overlap is not an

issue. Moreover, for NB ≫

molecule conversion is τa2m ∼
This timescale is safely below the fastest timescale for
trapped-atom motion τt = (ωr/2π)−1 = 4.7

justifying our neglect of trap dynamics and the kinetic
energy; physically put, this means that the Fermi en-
ergy is negligible compared to the atom-molecule cou-
pling strength.

It is important to mention two neglected complica-
tions: noncondensate modes and interactions between
particles. On the matter of dissociation to noncondensate
modes, and the related pair correlations[16, 17, 18, 19],
we note that in the all-boson case [60] such transitions
can be neglected for a sweep directed as in Fig. 2, i.e., for
˙δ < 0. Given the success of the analogy so far, similar
is expected for the Fermi molecule system. As for colli-
sions between particles, they are described in terms of the
coupling strength is λ = 2π~a/m∗, where a is the s-wave
scattering length, m∗ is the mass of the atom or the re-
duced mass of the atom-atom (atom-molecule) pair. An
estimate for λ indicates that it is negligible compared to
the atom-molecule coupling for a typical 87Rb -40K sys-
tem and, besides, particle interactions have little eﬀect
on sweeps across resonance in the boson case [63] and
similar is expected for Fermi molecules.

III. RAMAN PHOTOASSOCIATION OF
STABLE FERMI MOLECULES AND THEIR
SUBSEQUENT COOPER PAIRING WITH
ATOMS

Given that a degenerate mixture of Bose and Fermi
atoms admits basic collective association, the natural
question to ask is whether Raman photoassociation to the
ground molecular state will be eﬃcient, since for bosons it
is not a trivial matter to overcome the condensate mean-
ﬁeld shifts. If so, the follow up to this question is whether
it possible to realize Cooper pairing, not between atoms
or molecules, but instead between atoms and molecules.
First introduced to explain superconductivity, anoma-

lous quantum correlations between two degenerate elec-
trons with equal and opposite momenta–Cooper pairs–
are due physically to an electron-electron attraction me-
diated by the exchange of lattice-vibration-generated
phonons [64], and are a manifestation of fermionic su-
perﬂuidity [65]. Anomalous pairing between diﬀerent
chemical species was immediately suggested to explain
the larger excitation energy for nuclei with even rather
than odd numbers of nucleons [66], although it turned
out that interspecies pairing plays the dominant role.
Today quantum matter optics oﬀers a means to explore
condensed-matter and nuclear physics by proxy, such as
the pairing of fermions in atomic traps and nuclei [67].
Here we point out that, while the dipolar-dipolar case
has been considered, Cooper pairing between non-dipolar
atoms and dipolar molecules oﬀers a novel avenue of in-
vestigation.

In this section we survey Raman photoassociation [44,
68, 69, 70] of Bose-Fermi mixtures of atoms [55], and the
subsequent prospects for Cooper pairing between diﬀer-
ent chemical species (i.e., atoms and molecules). First,
we demonstrate that an arbitrary number of stable Fermi
molecules can be created via fractional [71] stimulated
Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP [72]), which is feasi-
ble because, contrary to bosonic systems [69], collisional
interactions can be negligible. Density ﬂuctuations in
the condensate leftover from the photoassociation pro-
cess then replace the vibrating ion lattice of the super-
conductor [73], and the subsequent phonon exchange can
enhance the intrafermion attraction. We ﬁnd that a typ-
ical attraction is enhanced, but this enhancement is in-
suﬃcient for a transition to atom-molecule Cooper pairs
within reach of present ultracold technology.

We model a Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms coupled by
heteronuclear photoassociation to electronically-excited
Fermi molecules, which is favored over homonuclear
transitions for well resolved resonances. The excited
molecules are themselves coupled by a second laser to
electronically stable molecules. For a degenerate sys-
tem, the bosonic [fermionic] atoms of mass m0 [m+] are
represented by the ﬁeld ψ0(r, t) [ψ+(r, t)], and the ex-
cited [stable] fermionic molecules of mass me = m0 + m+
[m− = me] by the ﬁeld ψe(r, t) [ψ−(r, t)], with the boson
(fermion) ﬁeld operator obeying commutation (anticom-
mutation) relations. The Hamiltonian density for said

The backbone of free-bound-bound stimulated Ra-
man adiabatic passage is counterintuitive pulse timing:
the two lasers are adjusted so that the level that level
with the most population is less strongly coupled to the
electronically-excited intermediate state, i.e., the bound-
bound pulse arrives ﬁrst and the free-bound pulse ar-
rives last, so that the intermediate state population and
the associated losses are kept to a minimum. When
the number of bosons is much greater than the number
NF , the frequency scale for atom-
of fermions, NB ≫
molecule conversion is set by Ω+ = √ρBK+. Although
a maximum NB = 100 is used, qualitative scaling to
large boson number is cinched by assuming a density,

ial frequencies ωr = 100

coupling is Ω+ ∼
2π MHz. The (assumedly nega-
decay rate is Γ = 10
tive) Fermi atom-molecule scattering length is estimated
as

stricted to NF = 4 for numerical ease, and large-particle-

NB = 100, the system reproduces the single particle case
(NB = NF = 1), i.e., the results are identical to those for
a three-level atom, as expected for a mostly-undepleted
boson ﬁeld. Atom-molecule collisions are negligible for
couplings as large as Λ+−/Ω0 = 10−5, which is similar
to a bosonic system, lending conﬁdence to the restricted-
collision model. Furthermore, NF = NB = 4 shows
that many-body eﬀects can limit molecular conversion.
This many-body eﬀect is similar to the one-color BEC

case [38], and is not attributable to fermion statistics.

The important point is that STIRAP works basically
as expected, even in the presence of collisions. This sit-
NF , the condensate
uation arises because, when NB ≫
density is eﬀectively ﬁxed, and the associated mean-ﬁeld
contribution simply amounts to a static bias that can
be absorbed into the detuning; with Fermi-Fermi col-
lisions blocked, which is most likely for small ground-
state molecules, only collisions between the Fermi atoms
and molecules can move the system oﬀ the required two-
photon resonance, and STIRAP works better. In other
words, we get the advantage of Bose enhancement of the
free-bound coupling (Ω+ ∝
√ρB), without the mean-ﬁeld
shifts. While limited computational resources preclude
explicit investigation, these results should scale quali-
tatively with increasing particle number, as for up to
NF = 20 in one-color production of Fermi molecules.

Now we are safe to presume the existence of an
arbitrary admixture of Fermi-degenerate atoms and
molecules, and thus to consider any subsequent anoma-
lous pairing. Once the transient STIRAP pulses have
vanished, the system is described by
H0 [Eq. (2a)] with
∆ = δ = 0 and σ = 0,
. For equal-mass fermions, it
is known that a fermion density ﬂuctuation gives rise to
an eﬀective chemical potential for the bosons, which cre-
ates a bosonic density ﬂuctuation, which in turn leads
to an eﬀective chemical potential for the fermions.
In
other words, phonons spawned by BEC density ﬂuctua-
tions are exchanged between the fermions, altering their
interaction. Just like lattice vibrations that drive the
attraction between degenerate electrons in superconduc-
tors, BEC density ﬂuctuations lead to an attractive in-

±

teraction that can enhance overall attractions, and thus
Cooper pair formation [73].

IV. CROSSOVER FROM A BEC OF TRIMERS
TO ATOM-DIMER COOPER PAIRS

While possible in principle, accessible atom-molecule
superﬂuidity means that next-generation technology
must shed another order of magnitude in temperature
from the ﬁrst generation [74], or that a system with
an attractive and a strong-but-not-too-strong interaction
will be found. Our opinion is that it will be worthwhile
to look for other ways of driving atom-molecule Cooper
pairs, such as a photoassociation or Feshbach resonance.
We therefore model an ideal degenerate mixture of
fermionic atoms and dimer molecules coupled by either a
Feshbach or photoassociation resonance to bound trimer
molecules. An ideal gas is chosen mainly because oﬀ-
resonant particle-particle interactions are generally too
weak for practical purposes. The initial fermionic atom-
dimer state could be prepared using a Raman scheme
for photoassociating a degenerate Bose-Fermi mixture of
atoms (as in the previous section), and selectively re-
trimer
moving the leftover bosons. The atom-dimer
resonance is expectedly well resolved so that, once the
initial atom-dimer state has been created, transitions in-
volving three free atoms are avoided. In contrast to the
all-boson case [75], ultracold transitions that involve a
free bosonic atom are Pauli blocked, i.e., the two identi-
cal fermionic constituents of a given trimer may not form
a bound state.

↔

In second-quantization parley, a particle of mass mσ
and momentum ~k is described by the creation opera-
tor ak,σ. The greek index corresponds mnemonically to
the number of constituent atoms a given particle con-
tains: 3 for bosonic trimers, 2 for fermionic dimers,

6

and 1 for fermionic atoms. All operators obey their
(anti)commutation relations. The microscopic Hamilto-
nian for such a freely-ideal system is written:

The free-particle energy is deﬁned by ~ǫk,σ = ~2k2/2mσ,
and the chemical potential by ~µσ.
In particular, the
molecular chemical potential is deﬁned by µ3 = 2µ
δ0,
where the bare detuning δ0 is a measure of the binding
energy of the trimer with δ0 > 0 taken as above threshold.
,
The (mode-independent) atom-molecule coupling is
and V is the quantization volume.

The key realization is how to cast the Hamilto-
nian (5) into a readily diagonalized form. Consider a
time-dependent unitary transformation, which leaves the

Given the generator U = Πk,σ exp[
k,σak,σ], then
uk,3 = uk,1 +uk,2 implies [H, U ] = 0 and, thus, H

ǫk,2(1)]/2, which
formation speciﬁed by uk,1(2) = [ǫk,1(2) −
conveniently corresponds to the special case uk,3 = 0,
leaving the trimer term unchanged. The new Hamilto-
nian reads:

Whereas the below-threshold regime of a trimer con-
densate is no doubt of interest (aR > 0), both as a pre-
cursor to fermionic superﬂuidity and in its own right, we
keep our focus on attractive systems. The strongly inter-
1, indicating a tran-
acting regime is deﬁned by kF |
sition to predominantly atom-dimer Cooper pairs at the
critical temperature Tc ∼
0.45TF . Using m3 = m1 + 2m1
as an example, which is akin to a system of 6Li atoms
and 7Li-6Li dimers, the required dimer-atom fraction is
N2/N1 = 0.31, the ratio of the eﬀective and atomic Fermi
temperatures TF = 0.7T (1)

F . Although Eq. (11) is of dubious validity
Tc ∼

in principle drive superﬂuid pairing between atoms and
dimer molecules at transition temperatures within reach
of present ultracold technology.

To rigorously identify the critical temperature for the
superﬂuid transition, it is necessary to go beyond the

FIG. 5: Onset of the superﬂuid transition to a Bose-Einstein
condensate of trimers dressed by anomalous atom-dimer pairs.
The non-zero superﬂuid gap clearly lowers the system energy
compared to the normal state (dashed curve). When the
detuning is large and positive (δ2

the system is mostly rogue pairs with a negligible fraction of

An algebraic system can be derived [76] from the
so-called grand partition function, Ξ = Tr exp (
βH),
which we solve numerically for the chemical potential
as a function of temperature, which in turn should dis-
play a characteristic cusp at the onset of superﬂuidity.
Physically, a cusp arises because the superﬂuid BEC-pair
dressed state is lower in energy than the normal state,
implying the concurrent appearance of a non-zero gap,
as shown in Fig. 5. For positive detunings large com-
pared to the collective-enhanced coupling (δ2 ≫

δ2), the eﬀective atom-dimer theory (11)
with δ1 ≈ −

tion. Also, the fraction of trimer is puny (
the large detuning. Any s-wave collisional interactions
are negligible compared to the detuning, justifying the
ideal-gas assumption. The trap, albeit omitted, should
actually favor the occurrence of superﬂuid pairing [48].

Dimer molecules created near a Feshbach resonance
are highly vibrationally excited and, thus, character-
istically long-range (K¨ohler et al.
Fermion-

[15]).

composite dimers are consequently long-lived due to
Pauli-suppressed vibrational relaxation [? ], and there
is no reason to expect otherwise from Feshbach trimer
states. In photoassociation, a two-color Raman scheme is
required to avoid spontaneous decay: a laser couples the
atoms to an electronically-excited intermediate trimer
state, a second laser couples the system to a ground-
electronic trimer manifold, and the intermediate trimer
state is well-detuned. Long-range states are available
with photoassociation, although a Raman scheme also al-
lows access to stable lower-lying vibrational levels, which
are much smaller and less understood. Nevertheless, the
molecular fraction is negligibly small when the system
is well above the appropriate threshold, diminishing the
chance for spontaneous for decay of any kind.

V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

In conclusion, we highlight that the term Ω = √N κ
was previously referred to as the Bose-enhanced free-
bound coupling; however, this behavior is now clearly
independent of statistics, so that Bose stimulation of free-
bound association has nothing whatsoever to do with
Bose statistics, but is instead a many-body cooperative
eﬀect that applies equally well to Fermi-degenerate sys-
tems. Consequently, we ﬁnd that collective Rabi oscil-
lations and rapid adiabatic are feasible in principle, and
that the latter should also be possible in practice. Sim-
ilarly, stimulated Raman adiabatic passage from a de-
generate Bose-Fermi mixture to Fermi molecules should
be possible, even in the presence of collisions. On the
other hand, while possible in principle, achieving oﬀ-
resonant atom-molecule superﬂuidity with current ultra-
cold technology means that a system with an attrac-
tive and a strong-but-not-too-strong interaction must be
found. Hence, we suggest searching for an association

8

resonance that combines atoms and diatomic molecules
into triatomic molecules, which leads to a crossover from
a BEC of trimers to atom-dimer Cooper pairs at a tem-
perature reachable with current techniques.

Each of the above results can be reinvestigated to de-
termine the eﬀect of long-range dipolar interactions. Oﬀ
hand, Rabi-like oscillations are not likely to bear much
fruit: the usual s-wave collisions lead to mean-ﬁeld shifts
that make exact resonance, and thus large-amplitude
Rabi oscillations, diﬃcult to achieve; the long-range dipo-
lar interaction will most probably make this diﬃcult sit-
uation even worse. But, we expect that rapid adiabatic
passage survives the inclusion of particle interactions, as
in the all-boson case [63], and the addition of a dipolar in-
teractions for the molecules could sideline this method for
creating heteronuclear molecules. Moreover, STIRAP is
highly sensitive to particle-particle interactions [69], and
it is possible that inclusion of the long-range dipolar in-
teraction could moot this technique for anything other
than simple heteronuclear systems (e.g., 6Li-7Li). Be-
sides the formation of heteronuclear molecules with an
association resonance, the role of dipolar interactions in
atom-molecule Cooper pairing could also be investigated,
which raises an interest because the dipolar molecule
will induce a dipole moment in the atom (as opposed
to pairing between two permanent or induced dipolar
particles [77]).

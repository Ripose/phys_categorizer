The independent eigenstates of the total orbital angular momentum

operators for a three-body system in an arbitrary D-dimensional space are

presented by the method of group theory. The Schr¨odinger equation is re-

duced to the generalized radial equations satisﬁed by the generalized radial

functions with a given total orbital angular momentum denoted by a Young

diagram [µ, ν, 0, . . . , 0] for the SO(D) group. Only three internal variables

are involved in the functions and equations. The number of both the func-

tions and the equations for the given angular momentum is ﬁnite and equal

to (µ

I. INTRODUCTION

From the very early stage of the progress in quantum mechanics in the real three-

dimensional world, it has been pointed out that the essence of these theories would be

easily understandable if their mathematics is constructed in the non-relativistic hyper-

space worlds [1,2]. The mathematical tools for generalization of the orbital angular mo-

mentum in an arbitrary D-dimensional space have been presented [3–7]. Recently, the

D-dimensional Coulombic and the harmonic oscillator problems in a two-body system

have been studied in some detail by many authors [8–22].

Exact solutions played very important roles in the development of physics. The exact

solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation in the real three dimensional space for a hydrogen

atom and for a harmonic oscillator were important technical achievements in quantum

mechanics [23], which provided strong evidence in favor of the theory being correct, at

least as far as atomic physics is concerned. The next simplest atom is the helium atom,

for which the Schr¨odinger equation cannot be solved analytically, but only numerically

[24–28]. In the numerical calculation, one of the main diﬃculties is how to separate the

global rotational degrees of freedom.

In our previous paper [29] we separated completely the global rotational degrees of

freedom in the Schr¨odinger equation for an N-body system in the real three-dimensional

space from the internal ones. We have determined a complete set of (2l + 1) independent

base functions for a given total orbital angular momentum l, which are the homogeneous

polynomials in the components of coordinate vectors and do not contain the Euler angles

explicitly. Any function with the given angular momentum l in the system can be ex-

panded with respect to the base functions, where the coeﬃcients are the functions of the

internal variables, called the generalized radial functions. The generalized radial equa-

tions satisﬁed by the functions are established explicitly [29]. For the typical three-body

system in the real three dimensional space [30,31], such as a helium atom [32,33] and

a positronium negative ion [34], the generalized radial equations [35] have been solved

numerically with high precision.

With the interest of higher dimensional ﬁeld theory recently, we have a try to generalize

the study of the D-dimensional two-body system to the D-dimensional three-body system.

The purpose of this paper is, for a three-body system in an arbitrary D-dimensional space,

to ﬁnd a complete set of independent base functions with any given total orbital angular

momentum and to reduce the Schr¨odinger equation with a spherically symmetric potential

V to the generalized radial equations, where only three internal variables are involved.

Any function with the given angular momentum in the system can be expanded with

respect to the base functions. It provides a possibility to calculate numerically the energy

levels of the three-body system in D-dimensions with high precision.

From the viewpoint of mathematics, the separation of the global rotational degrees of

freedom from the internal ones is a typical application of group theory to physics. The

properties of the independent base functions for a given total orbital angular momentum

would be more clear if they are constructed in arbitrary D-dimensional space than that in

the real three dimensional space. The total orbital angular momentum for a three-body

2

system in a D-dimensional space is described by an irreducible representation denoted by a

Young diagram with one or two rows. For the real three-dimensional space, the rotational

symmetry group is SO(3) group, and its only irreducible representations denoted by the

Young diagrams with two rows are [l, 1], which are equivalent to the representations

denoted by the one-row Young diagrams [l, 0], respectively. This is the reason why the

angular momentum can be described by only one quantum number l for the real three-

dimensional space.

This paper is organized as follows. After separating the motion of the center of mass

by the Jacobi coordinate vectors in Sec. 2, we review in Sec. 3 the generalization of the

orbital angular momentum operators and the properties of the spherical harmonics [4,6]

and the harmonic polynomials [7] for a two-body system in D dimensions. In Sec. 4 we

will deﬁne the generalized harmonic polynomials for a three-body system in D dimensions

and prove that they constitute a complete set of independent base functions for a given

total orbital angular momentum in the system. The generalized radial functions are

deﬁned and the generalized radial equations are derived in Sec. 5. Some conclusions will

be given in Sec. 6.

II. SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION IN D DIMENSIONS

For a quantum N-body system in an arbitrary D-dimensional space, we denote the

position vectors and the masses of N particles by rk and by mk, k = 1, 2, . . . , N, respec-

tively. M =

k mk is the total mass. The Schr¨odinger equation for the N-body system

so on. An additional factor √M is included in Rj for convenience. The mass-weighted

the number of the remaining linearly independent homogeneous polynomials of degree l

IV. THREE-BODY SYSTEM IN D-DIMENSIONS

vectors R1 and R2, which will be denoted by x and y, respectively:

where ξj are the internal variables. Since Eq. (22) is rotational invariant, the total orbital

angular momentum is conserved. The wave function Ψ(x, y) with the given total angular

momentum has to belong to an irreducible representation of SO(D). In the traditional

method, one calculates the wave function by the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients:

(y) are called the partial angular momentum states,

and their combination is called the total angular momentum state, which is a homogeneous

polynomial of degrees l and l′ in the components of x and y, respectively.

There are three problems. First, what kinds of representations (or total angular mo-

mentum L) appear in the Clebsch-Gordan series for decomposition of the direct product of

two representations denoted by one-row Young diagrams [l, 0, . . . , 0] and [l′, 0, . . . , 0]? This

problem has been solved in group theory by the Littlewood-Richardson rule and traceless

conditions. A new character is that the representations denoted by two-row Young dia-

grams appear in the Clebsch-Gordan series for a three-body system when D > 3. Those

representations denoted by the Young diagrams with more than two rows could not appear

because there are only two Jacobi coordinate vectors. For simplicity we denote a one-row

or two-row Young diagram by [µ, ν]

[µ, ν, 0, . . . , 0]. Hence, we have the Clebsch-Gordan

series:

(25)

When D = 4, the representation denoted by a two-row Young diagram reduces to a

direct sum of a selfdual representation [(S)µ, ν] and an antiselfdual one [(A)µ, ν]. Their

dimensions are equal to half of d4([µ, ν]) given in Eq.

(25). When D = 3, due to

the traceless condition, the only representations with the two-row Young diagrams are

representations [µ, 1], which are equivalent to that with the one-row Young diagrams [µ, 0],

8

respectively. Eq. (25) still holds for D = 3. Second, how to calculate the Clebsch-Gordan

coeﬃcients? The calculation must be very complicated. We will avoid the diﬃculty by the

method of determining the highest weight states directly. Third, how many base functions

are independent for a given total orbital angular momentum such that any wave function

with the same angular momentum can be expanded with respect to the base functions

where the coeﬃcients are the functions of the internal variables. We are going to solve

the last two problems by group theory.

Let us sketch some necessary knowledge of group theory. From the representation

theory of Lie groups [36–38], the Lie algebras of the SO(2n+1) group and the SO(2n) group

are Bn and Dn, respectively. Their Chevalley bases with the subscript j, 1

But, the bases with the subscript n are diﬀerent:

Fn = L(2n)(2n+1) + iL(2n−1)(2n+1),

If the eigenstates for a given weight m are degeneracy, this weight is called a multiple

SO(D), we only need to consider the highest weight state

where the coeﬃcients ψµν

q (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) are called the generalized radial functions. When

substituting Eq.
derivation is to apply the Laplace operator (21) to the function Ψ[µ,ν]

(36) into the Schr¨odinger equation (22), the main calculation in the

M (x, y). The calcula-

tion consists of three parts. The ﬁrst is to apply the Laplace operator to the generalized

radial functions ψµν

q (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3), which can be calculated by replacement of variables:

(37)

where ∂ξ denotes ∂/∂ξ and so on. The second is to apply it to the generalized harmonic

polynomials Qµν

q (x, y). This part is vanishing because Qµν

(37). Only three invariant variables ξ1, ξ2 and ξ3 are

involved both in the equations and in the functions. When D = 4, Eq. (40) holds for the

generalized radial functions either in [(S)µ, ν] or in [(A)µ, ν], because two representations

incorporate to one irreducible representation of the O(4) group when the space inversion is

considered. When D = 3, the equations for the functions in [µ, 0] and in [µ, 1] are diﬀerent

although two representations [µ, 0] and [µ, 1] are equivalent, because the functions have

(39)

(40)

diﬀerent parity.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

After separating the motion of center of mass, we have deﬁned the homogeneous

polynomial Qµν

q (x, y) of degree q and (µ+ν

q) in the components of the Jacobi coordinate

−

vectors x and y, respectively. Qµν

ν + 1) generalized harmonic polynomials Qµν

q (x, y) is a solution of the Laplace equation. We have
q (x, y) constitute a complete

proved that (µ

−

set of independent base functions for the total orbital angular momentum [µ, ν]. Any

wave function with the given angular momentum in the system can be expanded with

respect to the base functions, where the coeﬃcients are the functions of the internal

variables, called the generalized radial functions. The three-body Schr¨odinger equation

with a spherically symmetric potential V in D dimensions reduces to the generalized radial

equations satisﬁed by the generalized radial functions. Only three internal variables are

involved in the functions and equations. The number of both the functions and the

equations for the given angular momentum [µ, ν] is ﬁnite and equal to (µ

ν + 1). Only

−

a ﬁnite number of partial angular momentum states are involved in constructing the

generalized harmonic polynomials Qµν

q (x, y), and the contributions from the remaining

partial angular momentum states have been incorporated into those from the generalized

radial functions.

The generalization of this method to a quantum N-body system in D-dimensions is

straightforward. The diﬃculty is how to obtain the uniﬁed forms for the generalized

harmonic polynomials, because it needs D

1 vectors to determine the body-ﬁxed frame

1 Jacobi coordinate vectors. The cases with N < D are very diﬀerent

D. We will study this problem elsewhere.

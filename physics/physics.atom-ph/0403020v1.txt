We present a quantitative study of roughness in the magnitude of the magneti (cid:28)eld produed by

a urrent arrying mirowire, i.e. in the trapping potential for paramagneti atoms. We show that

this potential roughness arises from deviations in the wire urrent (cid:29)ow due to geometri (cid:29)utuations

of the edges of the wire : a measurement of the potential using old trapped atoms agrees with

the potential omputed from the measurement of the wire edge roughness by a sanning eletron

mirosope.

we believe the spetrum is dominated by instrumental

noise. Our use of the Boltzmann law to dedue the po-

tential results in a saling of the noise level by the tem-

perature. Sine the temperature used at 33 µm distane
is about 4.6 times smaller than for louds at 80 µm, we

expet the noise level to be smaller by the same fator.

This is onsistent with the observation.

In the following we evaluate the rough potential due to

edge (cid:29)utuations of the entral wire. For this purpose,

the edges of the wire are imaged using a sanning ele-

tron mirosope (SEM), after removal of the BCB layer

by reative ion ething. Figure 4(a) indiates that the

funtion f , whih gives the deviation of the position of
the wire edge from the mean position y = ±W0/2, is
roughly independent of x. We make the approximation
that f depends only on z . We dedue f from SEM im-

ages taken from above the wire (see Fig. 4(b)). To resolve

f , whose rms amplitude is only 0.2 µm, we use (cid:28)elds of
view as small as 50 µm. The funtion f is reonstruted

over the entire length of the entral wire using many im-

ages having about 18 µm overlaps. As shown in Fig. 4(),

where

several length sales appear in the spetrum. There are

small (cid:29)utuations of orrelation length of about 100 nm

and, more importantly, (cid:29)utuations of larger wavelength

(60 to 1000 µm).

The geometri (cid:29)utuations of the edges of the wire in-

due a distortion of the urrent (cid:29)ow whih produes a lon-

gitudinal magneti (cid:28)eld roughness responsible for a po-

tential roughness. To ompute the urrent density in the

wire, we assume a uniform resistivity inside the wire. We

also assume that (cid:29)utuations are small enough to make

the urrent density distortion linear in fL/R , where fL/R

As an be seen in Fig. 4, the top surfae of the wire

also presents some roughness. Using an atomi fore mi-

a orrelation length of 0.5 µm. Their alulated ontri-

density at least one order of magnitude below the one

measured with the atoms.

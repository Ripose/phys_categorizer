High resolution laser excitation of np Rydberg states of cesium atoms shows a dipole blockade at
F¨orster resonances corresponding to the resonant dipole-dipole energy transfer of the np + np −→
ns + (n + 1)s reaction. The dipole-dipole interaction can be tuned on and oﬀ by the Stark eﬀect,
and such a process observed for relatively low n (25 − 41) is promising for quantum gate devices.
Both Penning ionization and saturation in the laser excitation can limit the range of observation of
the dipole blockade.

Rydberg atoms have long been known to possess huge
electric dipole moments leading to exaggerated collisional
in particular,
properties of room temperature atoms,
large cross sections and long interaction times [1]. These
properties have stimulated great interest in the possibil-
ity of controlling the strong long-range interactions be-
tween cold atoms [2, 3, 4], which could be particularly
exciting for quantum information applications [5, 6]. One
interesting process is the possibility of dipole blockade in
the Rydberg excitation of atoms, due to the dipole-dipole
interaction shifting the Rydberg energy from its isolated
atomic value. If the volume of the laser excitation is small
enough, no second atom can be excited after the Rydberg
excitation of the ﬁrst one, producing an atomic ensemble
in a singly excited collective state. The use of the dipole
blockade of the excitation has been proposed as a very ef-
ﬁcient realization of a scalable quantum logic gate [6]. If
we consider the laser high-resolution-excitation of a large
ensemble of atoms from the ground state or from a low-
excited state towards a Rydberg state, the dipole-dipole
interaction between Rydberg atoms should lead to a lim-
itation of the number of excited atoms versus the initial
density of atoms. A partial, or local, blockade of the exci-
tation is thus expected. The ﬁrst excited Rydberg atoms
shift the resonance for their non-excited neighbors and
prevent their excitation with a narrow-bandwidth laser.

Up to now no evidence of a dipole blockade has been
demonstrated. In zero electric ﬁeld, the atomic Rydberg
state do not have permanent dipole moments and no
dipole blockade is expected. Second order dipole-dipole
or van der Waals coupling between Rydberg atoms can
occur, and a suppression of the excitation correspond-
ing to a partial, or local, blockade has been reported in
excitation of high Rydberg states (n ∼ 70 − 80) using a
pulse ampliﬁed single mode laser [7]. Cw excitations have

also been performed showing the supression of the exci-
tation [8] and studying the sub-Poissonian atom counting
statistics [9]. The authors notice that for long-duration
excitations, appearance of ions can lift the blockade. For
a broad-band excitation, the suppression of the excita-
tion is not expected. Rather a band of levels can be ex-
cited with a density-dependent broadening, which has
been probed using micro-wave transitions [10], or laser
depumping [11].
In high electric ﬁeld, the Stark eﬀect
mixes the Rydberg states, and the Rydberg atoms have a
signiﬁcant permanent dipole moment. The dipole block-
ade is expected but the presence of both dipole-dipole
and van der Waals couplings complicate the evolution
of the blockade versus the electric ﬁeld. An alternative
is the use of a conﬁguration of strong dipole-dipole cou-
pling in low electric ﬁeld with relatively low Rydberg
states, similar to F¨orster resonances [12]. The F¨orster
(or Fluorescence) Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is
commonly used as spectroscopic technique based on long-
range dipole-dipole coupling to estimate small distance
and dynamics between ﬂuorescent molecules [13, 14].

In this letter, we report the observation of the dipole
blockade of the Rydberg excitation by cw lasers, by tak-
ing advantage of a resonant dipole-dipole coupling of ce-
sium atoms, speciﬁcally the process

np3/2 + np3/2 −→ ns + (n + 1)s.

(1)

The dipole-dipole interaction is W ∼ µµ′R−3, where µ,
µ′ ∼ n2 atomic units are the dipoles corresponding to
the transitions np3/2 −→ ns and np3/2 −→ (n + 1)s, re-
spectively, and R the distance between the two atoms.
Control of the dipole-dipole coupling is achieved by us-
ing the Stark eﬀect. The resonance is obtained when, by
Stark shifting, the level np3/2 is located midway in the
energy diagram between the states, ns and (n + 1)s [2].
At such resonances, also called F¨orster resonances, we
observe a signiﬁcant decrease of the p excitation, inter-
preted as a local dipole blockade.

The details of the experimental setup have been de-
scribed in several papers [2, 4, 11]. But here, three cw
lasers provide a new high resolution multistep scheme of
excitation, as depicted in Fig.1 (a). The Rydberg atoms

are excited from a cloud of 5 107 cesium atoms (tempera-
ture 200 µK,characteristic radius ∼ 300 µm, peak and av-
erage density 2 1011 and 4 1010 cm−3, respectively) pro-
duced in a standard vapor-loaded magneto-optical trap
(MOT) at residual gas pressure of 10−10 mbar. The ﬁrst
step of the excitation, 6sF = 4 → 6p3/2F = 5, is pro-
vided by the trapping lasers of the MOT. The density of
excited, 6p3/2, atoms present in the MOT can be mod-
iﬁed by switching oﬀ the repumper lasers of the MOT,
with a delay ranging from 0 to 1 ms before applying the
other steps of the excitation. We use an infrared diode
laser (DL100 TOPTICA) with a wavelength of λ2 = 1.47
µm in an extended cavity device for the second step of the
excitation, 6p3/2F = 5 → 7sF = 4. The bandwidth is of
the order of 100 kHz and the available power is 20 mW.
The last step of the excitation, 7sF = 4 → np3/2 (with
n = 25 − 45), is provided by a Titanium:Sapphire (Ti:Sa)
laser pumped by an Ar+ laser. The wavelength λ3 ranges
from 770 to 800 nm, the bandwidth is 1 MHz, and the
available power is 400 mW. The Ti:Sa laser is switched
on during a time, τ = 0.3 µs by means of an acousto-
optic modulator. The beams of the infrared diode laser
and of the Ti:Sa laser cross with an angle of 67.5 degrees
and are focused into the atomic cloud with waists of 105
and 75 µm respectively. Their polarizations are both lin-
ear and parallel to the direction of the applied electric
ﬁeld, leading to the excitation of the magnetic sublevel
|m| = 1/2 for np3/2. The spectral resolution, ∆ν, of the
excitation is of the order of 5 − 6 MHz, limited by the
lifetime, 56.5 ns, of the 7s state and by the duration and
the spectral width of the Ti:Sa laser pulse. The magnetic
quadrupole ﬁeld of the MOT is not switched oﬀ during
the Rydberg excitation phase, it contributes for less than
1 MHz to the observed linewidths. The average intensity
(∼ 3 mW/cm2) of the infrared diode laser is chosen to
reach saturation of the transition (∼ 1.4 mW/cm2). At
the trap position, a static electric ﬁeld and a pulsed high
voltage ﬁeld are applied by means of a pair of electric
ﬁeld grids spaced by 15.7 mm. We analyze selectively
the Rydberg states by applying just after the Ti:Sa laser
pulse a ﬁeld ramp with a rise time of 700 ns, and by
detecting the ions with a pair of microchannel plates.

The experimental procedure consists of Stark spec-
troscopy of the np3/2 states at a repetition rate of 80 Hz
for diﬀerent atomic densities, and for diﬀerent Ti:Sa laser
intensities. During the excitation process a small number,
∼ 100, of ions less that one percent of the total number
of Rydberg atoms is formed, which we attribute to cold
collisions between Rydberg atoms [15]. These ions are
simultaneously detected with the Rydberg atoms. Fig.2
shows the analysis of spectra of the 38p3/2 state per-
formed at diﬀerent values of the electric ﬁeld. At zero
electric ﬁeld, the number of excited Rydberg atoms is
about 11 000, corresponding to an estimated average den-
sity of 2 109 cm−3. The electric ﬁeld dependence of the
width, the total number of atoms excited, and the num-

ber of ions present in the Rydberg sample at the end of
the excitation are shown in Figs.2 (a, b, c). First we ob-
serve a minimum in the number of excited atoms at the
resonance of the reaction of Eq. (1), at F = 1.46 V/cm.
The width of the lines away from the F¨orster resonance
is 6 MHz, the limit of resolution of the multistep laser
excitation. It is increased at the resonance to 8 − 9 MHz.
At the resonance, we do not observe any increase in the
number of ions. In the high ﬁeld wing of the resonance,
we can observe a small increase of this number, up to
200, which corresponds to a Penning ionization process
by exciting pairs of close atoms which are subjected to
an attractive force [11, 15]. The number of ions stays
small enough to add no broadening to the line. Figs.2
(d, e) show the selective detection of the population in
the 38p3/2 state and the population transferred in the
38s state versus the electric ﬁeld. The resonance in the
s signal is at the same position as the minimum of the p
excitation, both curves presenting the same width versus
the electric ﬁeld.

Fig.3 shows the evolution of the amplitudes of the
np3/2 excitation versus the electric ﬁeld for diﬀerent prin-
cipal quantum numbers n = 42, 40, 38, 36, and 25. Ex-
cept for n = 42 , we observe a minimum corresponding to
the resonance of the reaction of Eq. (1). For n ≥ 42, the
energy of a pair of atoms np3/2 + np3/2 becomes smaller
than the one of a pair ns + (n + 1)s, and the F¨orster
resonance no longer exists. Nevertheless at n = 42, the
diﬀerence between the energy levels of a pair of atoms is
only −9.5 MHz, small enough to observe a decrease of
the excitation at zero ﬁeld. The data show a clear dipole
blockade of the excitation of up to 30% for n = 40, 38,
and 36. For each n, we observe also a small increase in
the width of the spectral line of the p3/2 excitation at the
F¨orster resonance. For lower n, ∼ 25, a less important

dipole blockade of the excitation is also observed but no

One property of the dipole blockade of the excitation
is that it should be dependent on the atomic density and
on the laser excitation. Fig.4 shows the evolution of the

is used for most of reported results) and 2.7 109 cm−3.
First we see the appearance of the dipole blockade when
the number of Rydberg atoms exceeds 1000. Both curves
present then the same blockade up to a Rydberg excita-
tion of 3500 atoms. Above this point, the evolution of
both curves diﬀers. When the number of Rydberg atoms
exceeds 5000, the eﬀect of dipole blockade disappears in
the case of an initial 7s state density of 2.7 109 cm−3,
while its eﬃciency goes on to increase for a three times
larger density. This result can seem quite surprising and
is linked to the saturation of the excitation. Experimen-
tally, the number of Rydberg atom varies linearly with
the power of the Ti:Sa laser up to 4 mW, corresponding
to an intensity of 22 W/cm2, then the excitation starts to
saturate. For instance on Fig.4, to obtain 5000 Rydberg
atoms, we need ﬁve times more power (6 and 30 mW,
respectively) while the atomic density of 7s state is only
three times smaller. We observe a broadening of the res-
onance with the laser power (see Fig.4 (a)) independent
on the atomic density. By increasing the laser power from
0.1 to 10 mW we observe an increase in the eﬃciency
of the dipole blockade. If we increase more the power
of the Ti:Sa laser the dipole blockade becomes less eﬃ-
cient. Indeed, at high laser power the resonance lines are
broadened, such that the laser excitation of pairs of closer
atoms become possible, preventing the dipole blockade.
The range in density and laser intensity allowing obser-
vation of the dipole blockade is therefore limited, and the
dipole blockade results shown in Figs.2 and 3 correspond
to the optimum of our experimental conditions, with a
low power of the Ti:Sa laser (linewidth ∼ ∆ν) and a high
atomic density. At this point of this letter, we understand
most of the features of the experiment, the observed
dipole blockade seems to indicate that at the F¨orster res-
onance no pair of close atoms can be excited at a distance
smaller than Rmin ∼ (µµ′/W )
, which
corresponds for n = 38 to ∼ 4 µm, in agreement with the
measured Rydberg atom number and average Rydberg
density, 8500 and 1.7 109 cm−3 (W ∼ 2.5 MHz by con-
sidering the average density and 5.5 MHz for the peak
one).

An unexpected result is that the width of the F¨orster
resonance versus the static electric ﬁeld (see Fig.1 (b)),
which converted to frequency (50 ± 10 MHz in the case
of Fig.2 (b)) is much larger than the width of the spec-
tral line (8 MHz shown in the inset of Fig.4 (b)). The
resolution of this paradox lies probably in the dynamics
of the dipole-dipole coupling during the Rydberg exci-
tation, where many-body interactions are not negligible
when the Rydberg density increases [2, 3, 16, 17]. The
many-body eﬀects are linked to the migration of the s
state (ns or (n+1)s) excitation in the p state environment
by excitation exchange due to dipole-dipole coupling in
the frozen Rydberg gas, i.e. by the resonant processes:

The R−3 character of the dipole-dipole interaction makes
the dipole blockade mostly result of two-body eﬀects,
meaning during the excitation each atom is essentially
sensitive to its closest Rydberg neighbor. Nevertheless,
in the local blockade process a pair of atoms at distance
of the order of Rmin can be excited and interact with
the energy transfer of Eq.
(1) and the many-body ef-
fects of Eq. (2) occur. The role of the migration of the s
state excitation is to increase the number of s Rydberg
atoms in the sample, because a pair of close Rydberg,
p, atoms can react several times [2]. Such an ensemble
of s excitation enhances probably the blockade outside
F¨orster resonance, where the sp −→ ps dipole-dipole in-
teraction is always resonant, while the reaction of Eq.(1)
is no longer resonant and less eﬃcient. The broad band
of the F¨orster resonance is a signature for the many-body
behavior, while the narrow laser resonances are ones for
two-body interaction.

To conclude, we have shown clear evidence for a local
dipole blockade of the Rydberg excitation at a F¨orster
resonance, controlled via the Stark eﬀect. This result is
not only promising for quantum information but oﬀers
a lot of applications. The use of a second laser scanned
around the transition 7s −→ np3/2 should permit us to
excite pairs of very close atoms with a repulsive or an
attractive mutual force. The band of levels due to the

4

Rydberg interactions can also be probed by microwave
excitation [10, 18]. The precise shape of the resonance
should be an excellent probe of the random character of
the distribution of the pairs [19]. The Stark control of
the dipole blockade should also allow us to prepare Ryd-
berg atomic samples with pairs of repulsive or attractive
atoms to analyze the formation of ions and the evolution
towards an ultracold plasma [20, 21]. The observation
of the total dipole blockade, meaning the excitation of a
single atom, is still a challenge. It implies a volume of the
Rydberg sample with a radius of the order of Rmin. Here
we observe the F¨orster resonance up to n = 41, limiting
Rmin at the value of 4 µm. The choice of another F¨orster
conﬁguration with n of the order of 100 or more increases
Rmin up to 20 µm. A microwave ﬁeld instead of the Stark
eﬀect could also be used to produce the dipole moments
and to control the dipole blockade [22, 23].

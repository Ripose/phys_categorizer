Atom-surface interactions can signiﬁcantly modify the intensity and phase of atom de Broglie
waves diﬀracted by a silicon nitride grating. This aﬀects the operation of a material grating as
a coherent beam splitter. The phase shift induced by diﬀraction is measured by comparing the
relative phases of serveral interfering paths in a Mach-Zehnder Na atom interferometer formed by
three material gratings. The values of the diﬀraction phases are consistent with a simple model
which includes a van der Waals atom-surface interaction between the Na atoms and the silicon
nitride grating bars.

A coherent beam splitter is a useful component for
constructing an atom interferometer [1]. The purpose of
the beam splitter is to generate a quantum superposi-
tion of atom waves, propagating along two paths which
can be recombined to form an interference pattern. The
contrast and phase of the interference pattern can then
be used to study interactions that aﬀect the atoms dif-
ferently in the two interferometer paths. However, atom
beam splitters formed using laser light [2, 3, 4] and mate-
rial grating structures [5] can create beams with diﬀering
complex amplitudes. A familiar analogy of this in optics
occurs for light beam splitters formed using glass plates,
thin metal ﬁlms, and multi-layer dielectric stacks which
all cause a phase shift between the reﬂected and trans-
mitted components [6]. These complex amplitudes are an
important concern when building an atom interferometer
since they aﬀect the phase and contrast of the interfer-
ence pattern, and have been identiﬁed as a source of un-
certainty for atom interferometer gyroscopes [7]. Here we
present the ﬁrst evidence of beam splitter induced phase
shifts in an atom interferometer based on material grat-
ings and a new method for measuring these phase shifts
for interferometers that utilize diﬀraction.

The van der Waals (vdw) atom-surface interaction [8]
plays a signiﬁcant role in determining the intensity and
phase (diﬀraction phase) of atom waves split by a ma-
terial grating. Several atom-optics experiments have ob-
served how atom-surface interactions can aﬀect the in-
tensity of atom waves [5, 9, 10]. By comparison, few ex-
periments have directly measured the diﬀraction phases
induced by atom-surface interactions [11]. In this Letter
the ﬁrst and second order diﬀraction phases are measured
by comparing the phase diﬀerence between the various
interfering paths in a three grating Mach-Zehnder atom
interferometer.

The experimental setup used to measure the atomic
diﬀraction phases induced by a material grating is shown
in Fig. 1. A Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer, similar
to the one described in [12], is formed using zeroth and
ﬁrst order diﬀraction from three 100 nm period silicon

FIG. 1: Diagram of experimental setup for measuring diﬀrac-
tion phases with an atom interferometer. Since the interfer-
ence pattern is read out using G3 as a mask, only the paths in-
dicated by the solid lines will lead to a signiﬁcant interference
signal. The mismatch of the grating spacings ∆L ≡ L′′ − L′
and the diﬀraction phases Φn induced by G1 determine the
measured interference phases Φmn.

nitride gratings [13] which are denoted G1,G2,G3. These
gratings are nominally separated by 1 m. A collimated
supersonic Na atom beam is ﬁrst diﬀracted by grating
G1, inducing a phase shift which depends on the diﬀrac-
tion order and will be described later. Each diﬀracted
beam then undergoes ﬁrst order diﬀraction by G2 and
forms a spatial interference pattern just before G3. The
atoms transmitted through G3 are ionized by a 60 µm
wide hot Re wire and counted by a channel electron mul-
tiplier. Grating G3 is then scanned in the direction trans-
verse to the incident atom beam (x-axis) to determine the
phase of the interference pattern. While there are many
paths which can interfere at the plane of G3 only the
ones which involve ﬁrst order diﬀraction by G2 (as in-
dicated in Fig. 1) will lead to a signiﬁcant interference
signal because of velocity dispersion and the use of G3 as
a transmission mask. Since each relevant path through
G2 undergoes ﬁrst order diﬀraction both paths acquire
the same diﬀraction phase, which means there is no net
phase shift induced by G2. In addition, grating G3 acts

as a transmission mask so only the diﬀraction phases in-
duced by G1 will lead to a relative phase shift between
the interfering paths. In principle, the diﬀraction phases
can then be determined by comparing the phase of the
various interferometer outputs which can be measured
separately by moving the detector along the x-axis.

In practice there are two types of phase shifts that need
to be considered when predicting the relative phase of the
various interferometer outputs. One originates from the
diﬀraction phase induced by G1 and the other from a dis-
tance mismatch between the gratings G1,G2,G3, which is
denoted by ∆L ≡ L′′ − L′ in Fig. 1. In order to report
a measurement of the diﬀraction phases, expressions for
both of these phase shifts will be put forth.

From previous work it has been shown that atomic
diﬀraction from a material grating will create diﬀracted
beams with complex amplitudes ψn given by

where An is the amplitude and Φn is the diﬀraction phase
for a given diﬀraction order n as derived in [5, 10, 11].
The variable ξ is the position measured from the center
of the grating window whose size is w and grating period
is d. The expression in Eqn. 1 is valid in the far-ﬁeld
(Fraunhofer) diﬀraction regime and is appropriate for our
experimental setup as described in [5]. The phase φ(ξ)
represents the phase accumulated by the atom wave as
it propagates through the grating window, given by the
WKB approximation to leading order in V (ξ) as

atom-surface distances of . 1µm for Na atoms and ne-
glects the ﬁnite thickness of the grating bars [5, 8]. A
plot of diﬀraction phases and amplitudes are shown in
Fig. 2 as a function of C3.

There is also a phase shift between the interferome-
ter outputs induced by a distance mismatch of the grat-
ings G1,G2,G3 along the z-axis. The origin of this phase
shift can be understood by recalling that when two plane
waves interfere at an angle θ = λdBd−1,
interference
fringes will be formed with intensity maxima along lines
with an angle θ/2 as described in [14]. In other words, a
spatial interference pattern of the form cos[kg(x − zθ/2)]
with wave number kg = 2π/d will be observed. If the
n = 0, 1 paths depicted in Fig. 1 are regarded as plane

Φ∆L =

will be observed if there is a distance mismatch ∆L ≡
L′′ − L′ between the interferometer gratings. For two
general paths originating from the diﬀraction orders m, n
of G1 the eﬀective phase shift induced by ∆L will be given
by (m + n)Φ∆L, since the fringe maxima are just rotated
by an angle (m + n)θ/2 with respect to the z-axis.

The expressions for the diﬀraction phase Φn (Eqn. 1)
and grating distance mismatch phase Φ∆L (Eqn. 4) can
then be used to specify the wave function |χmni just be-
fore grating G3

|χmni = eikg x|ψmi + ei(m+n)Φ∆L |ψni,

(5)

for any two interfering paths involving the diﬀraction or-
ders m, n of grating G1. The wave functions |ψmi and
|ψni describe the two atom beams corresponding to a
given interferometer output and accounts for the diﬀrac-
tion phases and amplitudes through the relations

intensity can then be found in the usual way

∝ 1 + Cmn cos(kgx + Φmn),

(8)

where Cmn and Φmn are the observed contrast and phase
for a given interferometer output involving the diﬀraction
orders m, n as depicted in Fig. 1. The measured inter-
ferometer phase

Φmn ≡ (Φm − Φn) − (m + n)Φ∆L,

(9)

can also be expressed in terms of the diﬀraction phases
Φn and grating mismatch phase shift Φ∆L. From Eqn. 9
it can be seen that Φmn = −Φ−m−n, as implied by the
symmetry of the interferometer.

Equations 8 and 9 can now be used to predict the phase
shift between the various interferometer outputs shown in
Fig 1. One noteworthy aspect of Eqn. 9 is the possibility
for Φmn to be made zero if the diﬀraction phase term
is cancelled by the appropriate choice of ∆L. To verify
this prediction the phase diﬀerence Φ−10 − Φ01 = −2Φ01
was measured as a function of ∆L and the results are
shown in Fig. 3. The atom beam velocity v = 2900
m/s (λdB = 0.056 ˚A) was measured independently by
observing the diﬀraction pattern generated by G1 when
the other gratings are removed. Equations 4 and 9 can
then be used to generate the solid curve in Fig. 3, since
the grating period is known to be d = 100 nm. The data
agree quite well with our theory considering that there

tance mismatch ∆L. The solid line is a best ﬁt using Eqn.

are no free parameters in the solid curve. At this point
∆L is known only up to some oﬀset ∆L01 which can
be interpreted as the grating distance mismatch which
leads to the special case of Φ∆L = Φ0 − Φ1. However,
the value of ∆L01 will be determined next using another
independent measurement technique.

As ∆L is shifted further from zero the partial spatial
and temporal coherence of the atom beam causes the
measured interference contrast to decrease. This notion
is evident in the experimental data presented in Fig. 4,
which plots the observed interference contrast as a func-
tion of ∆L. This contrast peak can be used to determine
the oﬀset ∆L01, which then speciﬁes the value of Φ0 − Φ1
through Eqns. 4 and 9. For our particular atom beam
setup spatial coherence was the dominant mechanism re-
sponsible for the contrast reduction.

The spatial coherence of the atom beam is determined
by the spatial extent of the atom beam source, and de-
scribes the correlation of diﬀerent transverse points of the
wave function. When ∆L = 1 mm there is about 60 nm
of shear (i.e. transverse displacement) between the two
interfering beams, since θ = λdBd−1 ≈ 60 µrad. As a
result the contrast will be reduced because the regions of
overlap for the two interfering wave functions will be less
correlated when there is nonzero shear. The van Cittert-
Zernike theorem states that the contrast will be reduced
in a way that is related to the spatial Fourier transform
of the atom beam source proﬁle [6]. If the source inten-
sity distribution is assumed to be w−1

the contrast will be reduced according to

FIG. 5: Measured contrast, phase, and average intensity as a
function of detector position. From the contrast proﬁle one
can clearly make out the diﬀerent interferometer outputs as
indicated in Fig. 1. The grating distance mismatch ∆L was
chosen so that Φ01 = −Φ−10 ≈ 0.

to the data in Fig. 4 using Eqn. 10 yielded a value of
∆L01 = 218 ± 72 µm. Since d = 100 nm and zc = 2.8 m,
a best ﬁt value of wc = 81 µm was found to be consistent
with the data, according to Eqn. 10.

Given the data in Figs. 3 and 4 the best ﬁt value of
∆L01 implies that Φ0 − Φ1 = 0.39 ± 0.13 rad, according
to Eqn. 4. The diﬀraction phase Φ0 = 0.30 ± 0.15 rad
was measured recently in [11], which yields the ﬁrst order
diﬀraction phase Φ1 = −0.09 ± 0.20 rad. This value for
Φ1 is consistent with the value predicted by Eqn. 1, as
summarized in Table I.

By moving the detector so that it intercepts the diﬀer-
ent interferometer outputs indicated in Fig. 1 the higher
order diﬀraction phases can be determined. The mea-
sured contrast, phase, and intensity is shown in Fig. 5 as
a function of detector position. From Fig. 5 the phase
Φ12 = 0.4 ± 0.2 rad can be determined. Equation 9 then
implies that Φ1 − Φ2 = 1.57 rad, which ﬁnally leads to
Φ2 = −1.66 ± 0.48 rad. This value compares well to that
predicted by Eqn. 1, as shown in Table I.

In conclusion the atomic diﬀraction phases Φn in-

duced by a material grating structure have been mea-
sured for n = 0, 1, 2. This was accomplished by com-
paring the relative phases of the various outputs of a
three-grating Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer. These
measurements agree with a simple model that includes
a vdW atom-surface interaction between the Na atom
beam and the silicon nitride grating. In the future, one
could simultaneously monitor Φ01 and Φ−10 with two de-
tectors, while applying some interaction to say the n = 1
arm. One could then perform self-referencing phase mea-
surements with the interferometer, eliminating the need
to take control data in a serial fashion. In this type of
application knowledge of the diﬀraction phases observed
here would be required.

A systematic study of the decay rates of antiprotonic helium (p4He+ and p3He+) at CERN AD
(Antiproton Decelerator) has been made by a laser spectroscopic method. The decay rates of some
of its short-lived states, namely those for which the Auger rates γA are much larger than their
radiative decay rates (γrad ∼ 1 µs−1), were determined from the time distributions of the antiproton
annihilation signals induced by laser beams, and the widths of the atomic resonance lines. The
magnitude of the decay rates, especially their relation with the transition multipolarity, is discussed
and compared with theoretical calculations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The antiprotonic helium atom (pHe+) is an exotic
three-body system consisting of an antiproton, an elec-
tron, and a helium nucleus [1, 2, 3]. Detailed studies have
been done for its metastable-state region, where the prin-
cipal quantum number n and angular momentum l are
both around 38, and where lifetimes against annihilation
can be as long as several microseconds. Recently new
CPT-violation limits on the antiproton mass and charge
were determined [4] at CERN AD (Antiproton Decel-
erator) using a laser spectroscopic method to measure
some transition energies of the pHe+ atom to a precision
of 50–200 ppb. The measured transition energies were
compared with two independent variational three-body
calculations with QED corrections by Korobov [5, 6, 7]
and by Kino [8, 9].

In addition to their level energies Er, an important
property of the states of this exotic atom is their decay
rate γ, which forms the imaginary part of the complex
energy,

E = Er − i

γ/2π
2

.

(1)

In particular, the Auger rates γA, which are dominant
in the total decay rate for some pHe+ states, have been
calculated by many theorists [10, 11, 12, 13] over a period
of more than 30 years. The latest calculations with CCR

(Complex Coordinate Rotation) method by Korobov [7]
and Kino [9] yield both real and imaginary parts of the
complex energy at the same time, and the both parts are
expected to have absolute precisions of the same order.
An independent check on the validity of these three-body
calculations can therefore be obtained by measuring the
decay rates of Auger-dominant states.

Although the CPT-violation limits [4] were obtained
by the level-energy measurements with high relative pre-
cisions of 50–200 ppb, discussions of the decay rates
with such high accuracy are diﬃcult both experimen-
tally and theoretically. The experimental diﬃculty orig-
inates in the ﬁnite response time in the detection of
the antiproton annihilations, and in the broadening of
the atomic spectral linewidth from various sources (laser
linewidth, Doppler width and so on). Theoretically, the
diﬃculty lies in representing continuum-coupled discrete
states with a limited set of wave functions, and in the
small magnitude of the Auger widths (order of MHz–
GHz) compared to the transition energies (0.4–1 PHz,
from visible light to UV). However, due to the smallness
of the Auger widths, the absolute precisions of both ex-
perimental and theoretical decay rates can be as good
as those of the level energies for some states, and their
measurements would be meaningful for the veriﬁcation
of the CCR calculations.

A prominent and important feature of the theoretically
calculated Auger rates is their drastic dependence on the

lowest possible transition multipolarity L, which is equal
to the minimum angular momentum carried away by the
Auger electron [10, 12]. The theoretical rates are approx-
imated by a rough estimation,

γA ∼ 1017−3L s

−1 for L = 2, 3, 4.

(2)

States with L ≤ 3 have radiative rates of 105–106 s−1.
They are consequently Auger-dominated, and we refer
to them as “short-lived” states. For states L > 3, fast
Auger decays are suppressed, and the atom de-excites
only radiatively. These are the states which we call
“metastable”.

By 2001, we had studied the decay rates of eight p4He+
states [14, 15]. Although most of them have decay rates
in accordance with the above approximate Eq. (2), we
found two exceptions. One was the (n, l)=(37, 33) state,
which is possibly aﬀected by an electron-excited conﬁgu-
ration (32, 31)¯p ⊗ (3d)e having a nearby level energy [11].
Another was the (32, 31) state, the decay rate of which
our low-density measurement with the RFQ decelerator
[4, 16] revealed to be greatly enhanced by collisions. We
call these decay-rate discrepancies “anomalies” [15].

II. MEASUREMENT OF DECAY RATES

In 2001–2003, we studied decay rates of ten states of
pHe+, including seven states of p3He+. A detailed de-
scription of the experimental procedure using laser spec-
troscopy can be found in Refs. [17, 18, 19].

Antiproton pulses of duration ∼ 300 ns, each of which
contained some 107 particles were brought to rest in a he-
lium gas target at a temperature of 5.5 K and pressures
between 20 and 200 kPa. Charged pions produced by
their subsequent annihilation were detected by ˇCerenkov
counters, time spectra of these pions being recorded as
analog pulses (“ADATS”, for Analog Delayed Annihila-
tion Time Spectrum), by a digital oscilloscope [20].

When we applied a laser pulse tuned to a wavelength
of a metastable to short-lived transition, a sharp peak
appeared in the ADATS, the intensity (area) of which was
proportional to the number of antiproton annihilations
induced by the laser pulse. Spectral line proﬁles could
then be obtained by plotting the peak intensity against
the laser wavelength as this was scanned through the
central transition wavelength.

Three methods were used to deduce decay rates ac-

cording to their magnitude.

A. Decay rates faster than 6 ns

−1 (wide

resonances)

When the decay rate is fast enough, a transition to
the state is observed as a wide resonance having a nat-
ural width larger than the laser linewidth (∼ 1 GHz at
“high resolution” mode, see below). Fig. 1 shows four

(n, l) → (n + 1, l − 1) type resonances newly measured in
this work. Such transitions are called “unfavored”, since

2

duction. Their FWHM (full width at half maximum) were
obtained by ﬁtting with Lorentz functions. Statistical errors
are shown.

they have typically ten times smaller transition dipole
moments than (n, l) → (n − 1, l − 1) (or “favored”) tran-
sitions. The measurements were performed at a speciﬁc
target atomic density of 3 × 1020 cm−3 (6 K, 20–30 kPa),
since for most states ([14, 15]) no systematic density vari-
ation of the decay rates larger than the experimental er-
ror was observed.

The dye laser used in our laser system (Lambda Physik
Inc. Scanmate 2E) could be operated in “broadband” or
“high resolution” modes. In the “broadband” mode, the
power was high (a few 10 mJ/shot) but the linewidth
was several GHz, while in the “high resolution” mode,
the laser frequency linewidth was severely constrained
by an intracavity etalon to about 1 GHz. For some of
the unfavored transitions shown in Fig. 1, the laser was
operated in the broadband mode to fulﬁll the require-
ment of high power for the unfavored resonances. It is
diﬃcult to know the exact linewidth during the resonance
scans. By investigating the spectra broadening measured
by Fizeau interferometers, the linewidth could be deter-
mined as 4–10 GHz, except for the 448-nm case for which
the laser was operated in the high resolution mode with
a linewidth of 0.7–1.3 GHz.

The analysis procedure for each of these states was the
following. The resonance spectrum was ﬁtted with two
identical Voigt functions (convolutions of a Gaussian and
a Lorentzian), separated by a ﬁxed frequency splitting.
This splitting was introduced to represent the hyperﬁne
splitting [21, 22], caused by the coupling of the electron
spin and the p orbital magnetic moment. For the hyper-
ﬁne splitting, theoretical values by Bakalov and Korobov
[23] were used, or (2 ± 0.5) GHz assumed for uncalcu-
lated states. The width of the Gaussian component was
ﬁxed at the laser linewidth plus Doppler broadening, and
the Lorentzian width was obtained from the ﬁtting pro-
cedure. The Lorentzian width was considered to be ap-
proximately equal to the natural width ∆νnat because the

other factors such as the collisional and power broadening
were estimated to be much smaller than 1 GHz. Finally,
∆νnat was converted to the decay rates γ by

γ = 2π∆νnat.

(3)

The errors were estimated mainly from the statistical
ﬂuctuations, uncertainty of the laser linewidths and hy-
perﬁne splittings.

B. Decay rates of about 0.2 ns

−1 or slower (long

tail peaks)

If the decay rates are slow enough, antiprotons which
annihilate from the Auger-dominated state do so after a
measurable additional delay. We can then obtain the
decay rates directly by ﬁtting the “tails” of the laser
resonance peaks with exponential functions. The eﬀect
of the fall time of the Hamamatsu Photonics R5505GX-
ASSYII photomultiplier tubes (about 4 ns) in prolonging
these tails was corrected for in the ﬁtting procedure. This
method is applicable for decay rates up to about 0.1–0.2
ns−1, depending on the performance of the photomulti-
plier tubes.

FIG. 2: Prolonged laser resonance peak (lower) and unpro-
longed one (upper).

In this work, only the (34,32) state of p4He+ could
be considered to fall in this category. This state was
measured also in the previous work [15]; in the present
experiments we obtained a more reliable result by using
a fast-response photomultiplier tube.

C.

Intermediate rates

For the states that do not show either wide resonances
or prolongation of laser peaks, we cannot measure their
decay rates directly. The daughter states of an unfavored

3

[the (35, 33) → (36, 32) of p3He+] and ﬁve favored reso-
nances [to the (37, 33), (35, 32), (33, 31), and (31, 30) of
p3He+, and the (39, 34) of p4He+ from each correspond-
ing (n + 1, l + 1) state] come under this category. In this
case, we concluded that their decay rates are between
the two experimental limits. The lower limit (0.1 ns−1)
is determined mainly by the instrumental prolongation
eﬀect of the laser peak, as mentioned above. The upper
limit is determined by the laser linewidth. It is 6 ns−1
(corresponding to 1 GHz width) for the high resolution
scans, and 20 ns−1 for the broadband scan. The latter
value was obtained by assuming that the laser bandwidth
in broadband mode is wider than 4 GHz.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Fig. 3 and Table I show the results of our decay rate
measurements for all the eighteen (including eight al-
ready published) states. Theoretical values by Korobov
and Shimamura [13], Kartavtsev with co-workers [11],
and the latest calculations by Korobov [7] and Kino [9]
are also shown.

Most of the experimental decay rates are roughly in
agreement with the calculations. By using these results,
we were able to expand the recent precise experiment-
theory comparison of the level energies [4] to the complex
plane. In Fig. 4, the complex energy, deﬁned as Eq. (1),
was compared with values from two theories, [7] and [9].
For the imaginary part (i.e. the half Auger width) of the
three p4He+ states presented in Fig. 4, no discrepancy
greater than 10 MHz, was found. This limit is absolutely
even more precise than that obtained for the real part
(i.e. the level energy).

A noteworthy state is the (36, 32) of p3He+. Although
an ab-initio calculation [13] predicted a large anomaly, its
decay rate was found to be non-anomalous. Another cal-
culation [11] was done by introducing continuum-coupled
wave functions explicitly in the equation of motion, and
resulted in a non-anomalous value. After the present ex-
periment was ﬁnished Korobov presented the results of
a new calculation with the CCR method. These are in
good agreement with our experiment, suggesting that the
coupling with the continuum is well represented by this
new method.

As for the latest results obtained in this work, two
anomalous candidates have been found. They were the
(35, 32) state of p4He+ and the (34, 31) state of p3He+,
both of which have much faster decay rates than the typ-
ical values expected by Eq. (2). Theoretical Auger rates
are also faster than the typical rates for the (35, 32) state
of p4He+, but there is a large discrepancy between the
two CCR calculations for the (34, 31) state of p3He+.
Korobov obtained an anomalous value in the old calcula-
tion [13], but his latest result [7] is non-anomalous, while
the value by Kino [9] is anomalous.

These situations resemble the case of the (37, 33) state
of p4He+, the rate of which is supposed to be increased

[14, 15] are shown. The bold vertical dotted lines show the typical Auger rates estimated by Eq. 2. The experimental points

Sec. II C). Some of the experimental error bars are too small to see.

by a state mixing with an electron-excited conﬁguration
having a nearby level energy. Since an excited electron
is far away from the nucleus compared to the distance of
the other two particles, the energy of the electron-excited
states can be approximated by the following formula [11,
15],

There is still a possibility that the rate enhancements
were caused by collisions, since we do not know the exper-
imental decay rates of the atom isolated in vacuum. In
any case, studying these states both experimentally and
theoretically should be a good test for understanding the
continuum-coupled three-body system.

in atomic units. Here Z = 2 is the atomic number of
helium. As are illustrated in Fig. 5, the conﬁgurations
(31, 30)¯p ⊗ (3d)e for the (35, 32) state of p4He+, and
(30, 29)¯p ⊗ (3d)e for the (34, 31) state of p3He+ can be
the reason for the anomalies in the same way. For the
latter case, the possibility of the inﬂuence by an electron-
excited state was pointed out by Kartavtsev [11].

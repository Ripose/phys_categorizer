The polarization state of the optical electromagnetic ﬁeld lying several nanometers above complex
dielectric–air interfaces reveals the intricate light–matter interaction that occurs in the near–ﬁeld
zone.From the experimental point of view, access to this information is not direct and can only
be extracted from an analysis of the polarization state of the detected light. These polarization
states can be calculated by diﬀerent numerical methods well–suited to near–ﬁeld optics.
In this
paper, we apply two diﬀerent techniques (Localized Green Function Method and Diﬀerential Theory
of Gratings) to separate each polarisation component associated with both electric and magnetic
optical near–ﬁelds produced by nanometer sized objects. A simple dipolar model is used to achieve

study by demonstrating the role played by the near–ﬁeld polarization in the formation of the local
density of states.

INTRODUCTION

Light interactions with dielectric or metallic surfaces
displaying well–deﬁned subwavelength–sized structures
(natural or lithographically designed) give rise to unusual
optical eﬀects[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The
recently observed “light conﬁnement state” in which the
light ﬁeld is trapped by individual surface defects, be-
longs to this class of phenomena[8]. Although, with usual
dielectric materials (silica for example), the local near–
ﬁeld intensity variations observed around the particles (or
structures) remains moderate over the optical spectrum
(between 10 to 40 per cent of the incident light inten-
sity), these variations can nevertheless be easily mapped
with the tip of a Photon Scanning Tunneling Microscope
(PSTM)[8]. The images recorded with this technique re-
veal dramatic changes when passing from the TM (trans-
verse magnetic) to the TE (transverse electric) –polarized
modes. In general, TM–polarized light tends to display
larger contrast than TE–polarized light. ¿From the ex-
perimental point of view, the deﬁnition of the polar-
ization direction of the incident and detected intensity
must be deﬁned with respect to a unique incident plane.
About six years ago Van Hulst and collaborators pro-
posed a clever probe conﬁguration devoted to polariza-
tion mapping [13]. These authors performed these mea-
surements by using a combined PSTM/AFM microscope
in which detection is implemented by a microfabricated
silicon–nitride probe. ¿From this technique, polarization
contrast is extracted by changing the polarization direc-
tions of both the incident and the detected light. The

main ﬁndings gathered in this work[13], concern the rel-
ative eﬃciency of the four excitation–detection possibil-
ities (TE/TE,TE/TM,TM/TE,and TM/TM) to record
a highly resolved PSTM image.
In particular, the ef-
ﬁciency of the TM/TM acquisition mode is well repro-
duced. Although a complete interpretation of this work
requires a realistic numerical implementation of the com-
bined AFM/PSTM probe tip, we can obtain useful in-
formation by analyzing the near–ﬁeld polarization state
versus the polarization state of the illumination mode.

In addition,

in closely related contexts, the control
of the near–ﬁeld polarization state provides an interest-
ing and versatile tool for generating powerful applica-
tions (tunneling time measurements [14], highly–resolved
microscopy and spectroscopy [1], surface plasmon reso-
nance spectroscopy of molecular adlayers [15], atom op-
tics [19, 20]. More precisely, in the ﬁeld of atom optics
and interferometry, one is interested in building diﬀrac-
tion gratings that can play the role of beam splitters.
Several devices have been successfully realised, ranging
from mechanical transmission gratings to light standing
waves in free space or evanescent for a prism. For a
general review the reader is referred to [16]. To circum-
vent some theoritical limitations [17] it has been recently
proposed [18] to use micrometer sized metallic stripes
to shape the evanescent ﬁeld. A full near-ﬁeld, metal-
lic/dielectric approach open obviously new perspectives.
In particular the spacing period is no longer linked to the
atomic optical transition and a reﬂection stucture cannot
clug. More, higher harmonics in the optical evanescent
ﬁeld can be tuned to produce for example a blazed atomic

and

grating. Nevertheless, the optical potential is strongly
related to the light ﬁeld polarisation, which is a farther
motivation for the present study. We will begin our the-
oretical analysis with a simple dipolar scheme in which
the main experimental parameters (incident angle, opti-
cal index, polarization of the incident light, ...) appear
explicitly[21, 22, 23]. In a second stage, these results will
be completed with an ab–initio approach allowing objects
of arbitrary shape to be treated exactly.

SINGLE DIELECTRIC PARTICLE

To illustrate the coupling between a polarized incident
wave and a small spherical object lying on the sample,
we consider the simple dipolar model depicted in Fig. 1.

ated with the bare surface, and R = (0, 0, R) labels the

properties of the spherical particle–surface supersystem
is described in terms of a “dressed” polarizability[23, 24].

A. New ﬁeld components in the near–ﬁeld domain

At an observation point r located above the sample
(z > 0) and in the immediate proximity of the particle,
the incident light ﬁeld is locally distorted. As illustrated
in Ref.
[25], these distortions generate not only a pro-
found modiﬁcation of the intensity level (both electric
and magnetic), but also a complete change of the po-
larization state. At subwavelength distances from the
scatterers, we expect therefore to observe the occurrence
of new components that were absent in the incident ﬁeld
{E0(r, t); B0(r, t)}. The physical origin of this polariza-
tion transfer can be easily understood if we introduce
the two relevant ﬁeld propagators S0 and Q0 that es-
tablish the physical link between the oscillating dipole
µ(t) = αef (R, ω0) · E0(R, t) and the new near–ﬁeld state
{E(r, t); B(r, t)} generated above the particle

E(r, t) = E0(r, t) + S0(r, R) · αef f (R, ω0) · E0(R, t)

Illumination with a TE–polarized surface wave

In this incident polarization mode, the electric ﬁeld is
directed along the (OY) axis. We have then E0(R, t) =
(0, E0(t), 0). Let us see what happens when the observa-
tion point moves along the diagonal straigth line (A–B)
schematized in ﬁgure 2. For a given β angle, the intro-
duction of the position vector r = (r cos(β), r sin(β), z)
(where r varies between −∞ and ∞) along the line (A–
B), allows the electric ﬁeld polarization evolution to be

observed when passing over the particle. Each cartesian
component can be simply extracted from Eq. (5). This
leads to three analytical relations:

Some interesting features can be deduced from these
equations. (i) First, we observe that the polarisation is
not modiﬁed when the observation point is perpendicular
the particle center (i.e. when r = 0). The set of equations
reduces then to

Ex(t) = 0,

Clearly the eﬀective polarizability reduces the electric
ﬁeld magnitude compared to its initial value. This fact
explains the observation of contrasted dark zones above
small particles lighted with the TE polarization (c.f. Fig.
(4)). (ii) Around the particle (when R/2 < r < 2R) two
new components, namely Ex(t) and Ez(t), deﬁne a new
local polarization state. These components vanish again
when the observation point moves away from the particle.
Similar relations can be derived for the TM–polarized
mode from Eq. (5).

To conclude this section, let us examine what happens
with the magnetic ﬁeld part (cf. Eq. 6). Since in the
reference system of Fig. (1), the incident magnetic ﬁeld
displays two components diﬀerent from zero, B0(r, t) =
(B0x(t), 0, B0z(t)), we can write

Bx(t) = B0x(t) −

iω0(z − R)

Bz(t) = B0z(t) +

k E0(t).

(18)

Unlike what happens with the electric ﬁeld, the particle
does not produce new magnetic ﬁeld components in the
near-ﬁeld.
In this case, the polarization change corre-
sponds to a diﬀerent balance in the initial components.
It is important to recall that we have used the dipole ap-
proximation to describe the particle-ﬁeld interaction, i.e.
the size of the particle is assumed to be small compared
to the wavelength of light. In a more realistic calcula-
tion, with nanostructures of characteristic dimension ≈
100 nanometers this result is not rigorously exact. How-
ever, we still expect, in TE polarization mode, a negli-
gible particle contribution to By compared to the total
magnetic ﬁeld intensity.

III. AB INITIO STUDY OF THE NEAR–FIELD
POLARIZATION STATE

Analytical results presented in the previous section
supply qualitative information about the spatial polar-
ization state distribution. In a recent paper, analysis of
polarization eﬀects was proposed in the context of near–
ﬁeld optics in which a limited number of single parti-
cles were investigated[26]. Since in many practical situ-
ations experimentalists are interested in lithographically
designed structures, these preliminary analyses must be
completed by ab initio procedures for solving Maxwell’s
equations.

A. Localized objects

Ez(t) = 0.

(15)

Recently, theoretical modelling in the vicinity of lo-
calized objects was performed in the framework of the

In the numerical work to be discussed in this section,
the retarded propagators S and Q have been chosen in
reference[31].

The test–object we consider in this section is the word
OPTICS engraved at the surface of a T i02 layer de-
posited on a silica surface. Intentionally we have chosen

ﬁeld susceptibility method[27, 28]. Today, this method
is one of the most versatile and reliable numerical tech-
niques to solve the full set of Maxwell equations for
the typical parameters of near–ﬁeld optics.
It works
well even for metallic nanostructures (see for example
references[7, 9, 10]). This approach (called the Direct
Space Integral Equation Method (DSIEM)) is based on
the knowledge of the retarded dyadic tensor S(r, r′, ω) as-
sociated with a reference system which, in our problem,
is a ﬂat silica surface[29, 30]. The numerical procedure
considers any object deposited on the surface as a lo-
calized perturbation which is discretized in direct space
over a predeﬁned volume mesh of N points {Ri}. In a
ﬁrst step, the electric ﬁeld distribution E(Ri, ω) is de-
termined self-consistently inside the perturbations (i.e.,
the source ﬁeld). At this stage, a renormalization proce-
dure associated to the depolarization eﬀect is applied to
take care of the self-interaction of each discretization cell.
The ﬁnal step relies on the Huygens–Fresnel principle to
compute the electromagnetic ﬁeld E(r, ω) on the basis of
the knowledge of the ﬁeld inside the localized perturba-
tions E(Ri, ω). The two main computational steps can
be summarized as follows:

(i) Local ﬁeld computation inside the source ﬁeld

E(Ri, ω) =

K(Ri, Rj, ω) · E0(Rj, ω),

(19)

Xj

where K labels the generalized ﬁeld propagator of the
entire system (localized object plus bare silica surface).
In the {Ri; Rj} representation it is given by

K(Ri, Rj, ω) = δi,j + vjS(Ri, Rj, ω) · χ(Rj, ω),

(20)

where χ represents the electric susceptibility of the lo-
calized object, vj is the volume of the elementary dis-
cretization cell, and S is the ﬁeld–susceptibility of the
entire system. This last quantity is usually computed by
solving Dyson’s equation:

vkS(Ri, Rk, ω) · χ(Rk, ω) · S(Rk, Rj, ω),

Xk

(ii) Electric and magnetic near–ﬁeld mapping computa-
tion around the source ﬁeld region

The lateral dimensions of the object are given in Fig.

tern is 20 nm and 2.1, respectively. The wavelength of
the incident laser is 633 nm. All ﬁelds are computed 10
nm above the surface of the structure, i.e. 30 nm above
the glass-air interface. The incident light is a TM/TE–
polarized evanescent surface wave traveling along the Ox
axis. This illumination condition is used in the Photon
Scanning Tunneling Microscope (PSTM). Some general
comments can be made about these results. First, all
components of both the electric and magnetic ﬁelds have
been excited in the near-zone. The occurence of these
new components is a pure near–ﬁeld eﬀect because it is
always localized around the structures. In Figs. (4) and
(5) we display the electric ﬁeld part. As predicted in sec-

sults, numerous regions appear with a dark contrast and
a moderate intensity level.

As expected, the excellent image–object relation cur-
rently observed in the TM–polarized mode is mainly pro-
vided by the ﬁeld component Ez normal to the object.

The magnetic near–ﬁeld intensity maps (cf. Figs. 6, 7)
also show a signiﬁcant conﬁnement of the magnetic ﬁeld
over the particle which reverses the contrast with respect
to the electric map. Similarly to what happens with the
electric ﬁeld, the role played by the additional compo-
nents can degrade the topographic information contained
in the complete ﬁeld maps. Notice in Fig. (6) that, as
mentioned in section II, the new y-component of the mag-
netic ﬁeld is very small compared to the total magnetic
ﬁeld.

center of the metallic particle. While this scheme allows
non–local and quantum size eﬀects to be included, it is
nevertheless restricted to simple particle shapes (spheres,
ell0ipsoids, etc.). When dealing with spherical metallic
clusters having a typical radius below 15 nm this de-
scription is mandatory and can be easily included in the
DSIEM formalism[32]. For the applications discussed in
this paper, involving lithographically designed metallic
structures larger than this critical size, we can adopt the
discretization of χ(r′, ω) over all the volume occupied by
the particle. In this case, the local susceptibility is just
related to the metal optical index n by the relation[9]:

χ(r′, ω) =

(n2(ω) − 1)

In the visible range, the numerical data for describing
both real and imaginary parts of n have been tabulated
by Palik[33] for diﬀerent metals. We present in Fig. (8)
a gray scale representation of the electric ﬁeld distribu-
tion computed above the topographical object depicted
in Fig. 3. In this case, the high optical metal index gen-
erates complex ﬁeld patterns without clear relation to
the topography. Furthermore the possible excitation of
localized plasmons reinforces this phenomena and some
parts of the localized metal pattern (e.g. the corners) can
even behave as an eﬃcient light sources.

calized Green’s function method described above is no

longer applicable. But any ﬁgure can be decomposed in
points (direct space) or Fourier components ( reciproqual
space). We thus can use two methods wether the real ob-
ject contain few points or few Fourier components. In the
case of periodic gratings, the ﬁeld distribution can be in-
vestigated with this second class of methods [34, 35, 36].
The so–called diﬀerential theory of gratings (DTG) was
originally developed twenty years ago to predict the eﬃ-
ciencies of one– and two–dimensional diﬀraction gratings.
Based on a rigorous treatment of Maxwell’s equations,
this method can also be used eﬃciently to determine the
optical near–ﬁeld scattered by three dimensional periodic
objects. In the following subsection, in order to avoid a
complete presentation of this well–established technique,
we will only summarize the essential steps of the compu-
tational procedure.

As in previous sections, we are interested in the elec-
tromagnetic near-ﬁeld diﬀracted above objects engraved
on an interface illuminated by total internal reﬂection.
When using the DTG method[34], the electromagnetic
ﬁeld above the grating can be expanded in a Fourier se-
ries

where r = (l, z) = (x, y, z), A(r) represents either the

electric ﬁeld E(r) or the magnetic ﬁeld B(r). The 3D–
wave vectors kp,q =
kkp,q, γp,q
, associated with the har-
monic (p, q) obey the well-known dispersion equation

where dx and dy denote respectively the period of the
grating along the 0x– and 0y–directions. From Eq. (26),
it may be seen that the coeﬃcient γp,q may be either
real or purely imaginary. Real values of γp,q correspond
to radiative harmonics while imaginary values introduce
evanescent components in the expansion (25).

In a general way, the six components of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld A(r) can be deduced from two independent pa-
rameters usually named the principal components. Let us
choose, for example, the y–components Ey(r) and By(r)
as principal components. It is a simple matter to show
that the Fourier y–components of the ﬁeld just above the
surface of objects can be expressed as a linear combina-
tion of the y–components of the incident ﬁeld:

Eyp,q = T EE
Byp,q = T BE

pq E0y + T EB
pq E0y + T BB

pq B0y ,
pq B0y .

(cid:26)

(28)

The transmission coeﬃcients T EE, T EB, T BE and T BB
describe the coupling between the electric and magnetic
harmonics composing the scattered and the incident ﬁeld.
These coeﬃcients depend both on the geometry of the
sample and on the angular conditions of incidence but
not on the polarization of the incident light. The po-
larization of the incident plane wave is controlled by the
values of B0y and E0y. From a numerical point of view,
the transmission coeﬃcients are obtained by the inver-
sion of a complex square matrix whose dimension is 2NT
× 2NT (where NT is the total number of harmonics used
to describe the scattered ﬁeld in Eq. (25)). Columns
of this matrix contain the Fourier y–components of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld which would have illuminated the
periodical objects in order to obtain a pure harmonic
ﬁeld (p, q) just above the nanostructure. A detailed de-
scription of the calculation of the matrix elements can be
found in Refs. 34, 36. With Eq. (28), we can calculate
all the Fourier components of electric and magnetic ﬁelds
just above the objects, which are used as initial condi-
tions to obtain the ﬁeld anywhere.
General remarks
about contrast, relative intensities and image-object re-
lation have been made previously (see sections II B and
III A 1), therefore we only highlight the speciﬁc electro-
magnetic properties of periodic structures.

We studied a lattice of 100 × 100 × 100 nm3 T iO2 dots,
separated by 150 nanometers. A strong localization of
the electric ﬁeld appears above the pads in TM-polarized

over, a careful analysis of the diﬀerent components shows
that it is possible to create a particular ﬁeld map such
as ﬁeld lines oriented along y-axis (Ey in TE-mode) or
x-axis (Ex in TM-mode), or periodic ﬁeld spots with very
diﬀerent characteristics (spot size, periodicity and shape)
considering the other components in the two polarization
modes. These particular ﬁeld components distribution
could have a great interest for the interaction of cold
atoms with optical evanescent waves [37, 38].

IV. LOCAL DENSITY OF STATE AND
POLARIZATION EFFECTS

Unlike what happens with electronic surface states, the
Local Density of photonic States (the so–called photonic
LDOS) contains information related to the polarization
of the excitation ﬁeld.
It is well established that the
density of states near surfaces plays a signiﬁcant role in
near–ﬁeld physics [12]. In particular, the photonic LDOS
is a useful concept for the interpretation of ﬂuorescence
decay rate in the very near–ﬁeld [39] and could help in un-
derstanding image formation produced by illuminating–
probe SNOM [40]. By referring to the electric ﬁeld, we
deduce the optical LDOS from the ﬁeld–susceptibility of
the entire system (plane surface plus supported nanos-
tructures, see section III A) [40, 41]

ρ(r, ω) =

Im [T rS(r, r, ω)] .

(29)

2π2ω

In this expression, the optical LDOS is related to the
square modulus of the electric ﬁeld associated with all
electromagnetic eigenmodes of angular frequency ω. Be-
cause of the vectorial character of electromagnetic ﬁelds,
it is very useful to introduce three polarized optical LDOS
also called partial LDOS, so that [40]

ρ(r, ω) = ρx(r, ω) + ρy(r, ω) + ρz(r, ω),

(30)

ρi(r, ω) =

ImSii(r, r, ω),

i = x, y, z (31)

2π2ω

The three diﬀerent polarized optical LDOS computed
over a pattern made of three dielectric cylinders of optical
index 2.1 are represented on ﬁgure 11. At this stage, we
can made some general remark. In the conﬁguration in-
vestigated in ﬁgure (11) we can verify that both X–LDOS
and Y–LDOS are almost identical with just a rotation of
π/2 between them. Nevertheless, this properties does
not subsist any more if we reinforce the optical coupling
between the dielectric posts. More precisely, certain ar-
rangements of nanoscale pillars (circular or ellipsoidal)
can force light waves into states generated by the col-
lective coupling between the pillars leading to signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between X–LDOS and Y–LDOS maps.

Moreover, although optical LDOS characterizes the
spectroscopic properties of an electromagnetic system in-
dependently of the illumination mode, it is interesting to
note the strong analogy between the dark contrast over

the pads obtained for Y–LDOS and the dark contrast
that appears in the case of s-polarized illumination mode
(i-e incident electric ﬁeld along the y-axis) observed in
section II B. In addition, as in the case of optical near–
ﬁeld maps discussed in the previous section, the polarized
LDOS’s can display signiﬁcant discrepancies relatively to
the shapes of the underlying objects.

Finally, let us note that partial LDOS’s are not only
a powerful mathematical tool but can easily be linked to
the physical properties of electromagnetic systems. The
most famous example is the ﬂuorescence lifetime τ of a
molecule near an interface which critically depends on
the spatial LDOS variation [42, 43, 44]

V. CONCLUSION

On the basis of both simple analytical model and so-
phisticated 3D Maxwell’s equations solvers this paper has
focussed on the unusual behaviour of the light polariza-
tion in the near–ﬁeld. When subwavelength patterned
objects are excited by a surface wave of well–deﬁned po-
larization, a complex rotation of the light polarization
state can be expected in the near zone. This phenomenon
localized around the scatterer is a typical near–ﬁeld ef-
fect. The occurrence of new components is more pro-
nounced in the electric ﬁeld than in the magnetic part.
Subwavelength features are present in all components but
with very diﬀerent energy levels.

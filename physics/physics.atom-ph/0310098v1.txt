Abstrat

We have employed the relativisti oupled luster theory to alulate the magneti dipole and

eletri quadrupole hyper(cid:28)ne onstants for the ground and low lying exited states of singly ionized

magnesium. Comparison with experimental and the other theoretial results are done and preditions

are also made for a few low lying exited states whih ould be of interest. We have made omparative

studies of the important many body e(cid:27)ets ontributing to the hyper(cid:28)ne onstants for the di(cid:27)erent

states of the ion.

1 Introdution

The hyper(cid:28)ne interations in alkali metal atoms and alkaline earth ions have been of interest for quite

a long time [1, 2℄. A number of theoretial investigations inluding some based on relativisti many-

body theory have been performed [3, 4, 5℄ and they ompare reasonably well with experiments. Some

of the theoretially predited values ould be of experimental interest with the advent of high preision

tehniques [6℄ involving trapped and laser ooled atoms [7℄ and ions [2℄.

The high preision alulations of di(cid:27)erent properties of many-eletron atoms requires aurate wave-

funtions in the nulear region as well as the region far from the nuleus. The study of properties like

hyper(cid:28)ne onstants requires aurate wave-funtions near the nuleus. Sine hyper(cid:28)ne interations are

sensitive to eletron orrelations, the determination of atomi hyper(cid:28)ne onstant provides an important

test for ab initio atomi struture theory [8℄.

In this paper we have arried out ab-initio alulations of the magneti dipole and eletri quadrupole

hyper(cid:28)ne onstants and ompared the many-body e(cid:27)ets for the ground as well as some exited states.

Setion 2 provides the neessary theoretial bakground to the magneti dipole (A) and the eletri
quadrupole (B ) hyper(cid:28)ne onstants. In setion 3 there is an overview of the oupled-luster theory and

its appliation to this spei(cid:28) problem. Finally in setion 4 the results of our alulations are presented

and disussed.

2 Theory

The interation between the various moments of the nuleus and the eletrons of an atom are olletively

referred to as hyper(cid:28)ne interations [8℄. In this paper we shall onsider the interations between the

atomi eletrons with the nulear magneti dipole and eletri quadrupole moments. Nulear spin an

give rise to a nulear magneti dipole moment and the departure from a spherial harge distribution in

the nuleus an give rise to an eletri quadrupole moment.

The hyper(cid:28)ne interation is given by [9℄

Hhf s =

M (k) · T (k),

(1)

Xk

where M (k)
are spherial tensors of rank k , whih orresponds to nulear and eletroni parts
of the interation respetively. The lowest k = 0 order represents the interation of the eletron with

and T (k)

the spherial part of the nulear harge distribution. The eigenstates of the hyper(cid:28)ne Hamiltonian are

denoted by |IJF MF i. Here I and J are the total angular angular momentum for the nuleus and the
eletron state, respetively, and F = I + J with the pro jetion MF .

In the (cid:28)rst order perturbation theory, the energy orresponding to the hyper(cid:28)ne interation of the

(cid:28)ne struture state |JMJ i are the expetation values of Hhf s suh that

The k = 1 term desribes the magneti dipole oupling of the nulear magneti moment with the
magneti (cid:28)eld reated by the eletron at the position of the nuleus. The nulear dipole moment µI is

hyper(cid:28)ne onstant A is de(cid:28)ned as

The seond order term in the hyper(cid:28)ne interation is the eletri quadrupole part. The eletri

3 Overview of the oupled luster theory : method of alulation

We start with an N eletron losed shell Dira-Fok (DF) referene state |Φi. The orresponding orre-

lated losed shell state is then

where T is the ore eletron exitation operator. Then the Dira-Coulomb eigenvalue equation is

|Ψi = exp(T ) |Φi ,

H exp(T ) |Φi = E exp(T ) |Φi ,

with the Dira-Coulomb Hamiltonian

H =

cαi · pi + (βi − 1)mc2 + VN +

Xi

1
rij

.

Xi<j

This leads to the exat ground state energy E of the losed-shell part of the system. Here α and β are
Dira matries and VN is the nulear potential. If we onsider the DF state |Φi as the Fermi vauum,

then the normal ordered Hamiltonian is

HN ≡ H − hΦ| H |Φi = H − EDF .

If we pro jet hΦ| exp(−T ) from the left we obtain the orrelation energy (∆E ) and if we pro jet
any of the exited determinant hΦ⋆| exp(−T ) we additionally get a set of equations whih are used to
obtain the T amplitudes. Using the normal ordered dressed Hamiltonian HN = exp(−T )HN exp(T ) the

orresponding equations for orrelation energy and amplitudes beome

and

hΦ| HN |Φi = ∆E,

hΦ⋆| HN |Φi = 0.

Here the state|Φ⋆i may be singly exited |Φr

abi and so on. The index a, b, · · ·
refers to hole and p, q, · · · to partiles. We have onsidered the oupled luster single and double (CCSD)
approximation, where the luster operator T is omposed of one- and two-body exitation operators, i.e.
T = T1 + T2 , and are expressed is seond quantization form

where A is a onstant vetor onsisting of the matrix elements hΦ⋆| HN |Φi, T is the vetor of the
exitation amplitudes and B(T ) is the matrix whih depends on the luster amplitudes itself so that

Eqn. (19) is solved self-onsistently. For example, a typial ontribution to the term

HN T2T2 is

Here Vdgrs is the two-eletron Coulomb integral and tpr
ad is the luster amplitude orresponding to a
simultaneous exitation of two eletrons from orbital a and d to p and r respetively. To obtain a full

set of terms whih ontribute to this spei(cid:28) exitation, diagrammati tehniques are used.

The ground state of M g+

alulate the ground state energy of the system we (cid:28)rst ompute the orrelations for the losed shell

) using the losed shell oupled luster approah and then use the tehnique of eletron

attahment (open shell oupled luster (OSCC)) method. The energy of the exited state are obtained

by the same way. In order to add an eletron to the kth virtual orbital of the DF referene state we

Partiles and holes are denoted by the lines direted upward and downward respetively. The double

line represents the O verties. The valane and virtual orbitals are depited by double arrow and single

The staring point of the omputation is the generation of the Dira Fok orbitals [13℄ whih are

de(cid:28)ned on a radial grid of the form

ri = r0 [exp(i − 1)h − 1]

(30)

with the freedom of hoosing the parameter r0 and h. Although we have used a large basis for the

generation of the single partile orbitals, the high-lying virtual orbitals (above a ertain threshold) are

kept frozen as their ontributions to the high-lying virtuals in the T and S amplitudes in the CC equations

are negligible. Another advantage of this approximation is that it redues the memory required to store

the matrix elements of the dressed operator H and the two-eletron Coulomb integrals in the main

memory and thereby reduing the omputational ost. In our alulation, we have inluded all possible

single, double and partial triple exitations from the ore.

of triple exitations to all orders in the residual Coulomb interation. It is, therefore, not surprising hat

the result of our alulation when arried out by using seond order MBPT as in [3℄, is in agreement

with the results of that alulation (see table 3).

The important ontributions to the magneti dipole hyper(cid:28)ne onstants for di(cid:27)erent states are given

in table 4. In partiular, we have analyzed the ontributions from various many body e(cid:27)ets and have

demonstrated that the most important ontributions ome from ore polarization and pair orrelation

e(cid:27)ets. The largest ontribution omes from O . The next two largest ontributions ome from (OS1 +
1O) and(OS2 + S†
S†
2O) whih orrespond to the pair-orrelation (PC) and ore-polarization (CP) e(cid:27)ets

respetively. The ontribution from the orresponding MBPT terms are listed in table 5. Figures 1 and

2 represents the pair-orrelation and ore-polarization diagrams in MBPT and CC respetively.

We have listed the ontributions from the di(cid:27)erent terms ontaining the dressed operator O in table
4 and the table 5 ontains the ontributions from the terms ontaining the operator O diretly. The

results given in tables 4 and 5 show that the CP ontribution is larger than that the PC in magnitude

for all the states, although the ratio of the two e(cid:27)ets is not uniform. However, in our earlier work on

Ba+
[14℄ we found that the PC e(cid:27)ets are larger than CP e(cid:27)ets for the s and p1/2 states but not for
the p3/2 and d3/2 states. This an be understood by onsidering the role of the relativisti e(cid:27)ets. Sine
Ba+
, the s and p1/2 eletrons have larger densities in the nulear

is heavier than a system like M g+

region for the former ompared to the latter.

5 Conlusion

In this paper we have arried out ab-initio relativisti oupled luster alulations of magneti dipole

(A) and eletri quadrupole (B ) hyper(cid:28)ne onstants for the ground and some exited states of M g+

. We

have shown that the dominant many-body ontributions to these properties ome from ore-polarization

and pair-orrelation e(cid:27)ets.

In addition to omparing with the available experimental data we have also predited the values of

A and B for a few states whih ould be of interest in the future. Using ion-trap and other experimental

tehniques it may be possible to measure both the magneti dipole and eletri quadrupole hyper(cid:28)ne

onstants for di(cid:27)erent states of M g+

thereby heking the auray of our alulations. This would

onstitute an useful test of the validity of the oupled-luster theory in apturing the many-body e(cid:27)ets

in hyper(cid:28)ne interations in light atomi systems with a single valane eletron.

Abstract

Relativistic corrections to the hyperﬁne splitting are calculated for the triplet
23S1 state of the helium isotope He3. The electron-electron correlations are
fully incorporated. Due to the unknown nuclear structure contribution a
comparison with the experimental result is performed via He3+ hyperﬁne
splitting. A signiﬁcant discrepancy with the experiment arises and a possible
explanation is proposed.

The calculation of higher order relativistic and QED eﬀects in few electron systems is
a long standing problem. Various measurements of transition frequencies have reached the
precision of few ppb, while no theoretical predictions are yet so accurate [1]. The usual
approaches, which incorporate most of relativistic eﬀects from the beginning, are not capa-
ble to include electron-electron correlations in a complete way. The alternative approach
starts from the Schr¨odinger equation and incorporates relativistic eﬀects perturbatively in
the eﬀective hamiltonian. The principal advantage is the simplicity and high accuracy of
nonrelativistic wave functions, which allows for precise calculations of higher order relativis-
tic eﬀects. The cost one pays in the perturbative approach is the complexity and singularity
of the eﬀective hamiltonian. The He3 hyperﬁne splitting [2] is a nice example of diﬃculties
in the bound state QED and perturbative approaches. The Fermi interaction, as given by
Dirac δ3(r) function is already quite singular. Incorporation of further relativistic eﬀects
leads to even more singular operators, which have to be properly handled. In a recent work
on m α6 contribution [3] to the helium 23S1 ionization energy, we have shown the way to
handle singular eﬀective operators. In this approach the Coulomb interaction have to be
smoothed at small distances with the use of some parameter λ, to avoid small r noninte-
grable singularities. The key point of this approach lies in the fact, that dependence on λ
cancel out between all matrix elements, and correct energy levels are restored in the limit
λ → ∞. However, our result obtained here is in the disagreement with experiments on the
helium hyperﬁne splitting. The possible explanation is postponed to the discussion at the
end of this work.

Hyperﬁne splitting in He3 of 23S1 state is due to the interaction of electron and helion
(nucleus) magnetic moments. In the 23S1 state both electron spins are parallel and sum to
S = 1 in contrast to the ground state were S = 0. Magnetic moment of helion comes mainly
from the neutron particle. It means that helion g-factor is negative and hyperﬁne sublevels
are inverted with respect to hydrogen, the upper one has S + I = 1/2 and the lower one
S + I = 3/2. Therefore, by a hyperﬁne splitting one means here Ehfs = E(1/2) − E(3/2).
According to the perturbative approach the general expression for the hyperﬁne splitting up
to the order m α6 is:

Ehfs = hH (4)

where r = r1 − r2 and r = |r|. Since H (4) contributes at order m α6 of hfs, see last term in
Eq. (1), we neglect here small recoil corrections. However, the possible signiﬁcance of these
corrections is discussed at the end of this work. hH (5)
hfs i is delta-like term with the coeﬃcient
given by the two-photon forward scattering amplitude. It is the same like in hydrogen and
strongly depends on the nuclear structure. It also automatically includes nuclear recoil ef-
fects and inelastic contribution (nuclear polarizability). hH (5)
hfs i has been considered in detail
for the case of hydrogen and muonic hydrogen. However, there are no suﬃcient experimental
data available for helion, He3 nucleus, therefore we were unable to estimate these contribu-
tions. Moreover, it would be incorrect to apply this correction for point-like nucleus, because
high energy photon momenta are involved, where nucleus, could not be approximated as a
point like particle. Therefore we will leave this contribution unevaluated, and at the end
for the comparison with an experiment, will subtract the appropriately scaled hydrogenic
value for hyperﬁne splitting The last term H (6)
hfs includes spin dependent operators, which
contribute at order m α6. It is only this term, which derivation was not performed so far
in the literature and is presented here. The detailed description on derivation of eﬀective
hamiltonian, reader may ﬁnd in former works, for example in [4]. There are four time or-
dered diagrams, which contributes to H (6)
hfs and are presented in Fig 1. The ﬁrst two are the
same as in hydrogen, other two are essentially three body terms. One derives the following
expressions, which corresponds to these diagrams.

It is worth noting the cancellation of electron-electron terms, hV3 + V4i = 0. Only the
electron-nucleus interaction terms remains, which are the same as in hydrogen. Matrix

Once the interaction is regularized, one can calculate all matrix elements and take the
limit λ → ∞. As a ﬁrst step, using formulas from [4], we rederived the known relativistic

It agrees with that, obtained directly from the
Dirac equation. Since for helium, all matrix elements could be calculated only numerically,
we will transform eﬀective operators to the regular form, where λ could be taken to inﬁnity
before the numerical calculations. The initial expression for a complete set of relativistic
corrections in atomic units is (with implicit λ regularization):

the helium and hydrogen-like helium hfs, therefore we will not consider it any further. The

In the numerical calculations of these matrix elements we follow the approach developed by

with randomly chosen αi, βi, γi in some speciﬁed limits. This basis set has been proven to
give excellent results for the nonrelativistic energy and the wave function. Moreover, its
simplicity allows for the calculations of relativistic corrections. With basis set N = 1200 we
obtained the nonrelativistic energy (without the mass polarization term p1p2 µ/M)

E = −2.1752293782367913057(1) ,

(34)

slightly below the previous result in [6]. Expectation values of Dirac delta function without
and with the mass polarization term are correspondingly:

h 4 π (δ3(r1) + δ3(r2))i = 33.184142630(1) ,
h 4 π (δ3(r1) + δ3(r2))iMP = 33.184152589(1) .

(35)
(36)

The last one gives the leading hfs in helium, which is

Ehfs = 2 Z α4 µ3
m M

|1 + k| (1 + a) hπ (δ3(r1) + δ3(r2))iMP ≈ 6 740 451 kHz ,

(37)

where use values of physical constants from Ref. [7] with one exception [8]. Numerical
results for EX with X = A, B, D, N are presented in Table I. The inversion of H − E in
EA is performed in the similar basis set as for 23S1 wave function, however the nonlinear
parameters had have to be properly chosen, to obtain a suﬃciently accurate result. Namely,
if 0 < X, Y, Z < 1 are independent pseudo random numbers with homogeneous distribution,
then:

α = A2 X −n + A1 ,
β = (B2 − B1) Y + B1 ,
γ = (C2 − C1) Z + C1 .

Parameters A, B, C and n are found, by minimization of the second order term with regu-
larized Dirac delta on both sides. The inversion of H − E in EB is performed in the basis
set of the form

φ = r1 × r2

vi (e−αi r1−βi r2−γi r + (r1 ↔ r2)) .

Unfortunately, we have not been able to get a reliable number for ED with this numerical
approach. The reason is that operators in ED are so singular, that this basis set gives a
very pure convergence. The result presented in Table I, is obtained analytically within 1/Z
approximation, namely we neglected completely electron-electron interaction and corrected
this value by factor hπ(δ3(r1) + δ3(r2))i/9. The estimated uncertainty is of the order of 10%.
The total contribution of m α6 term to hfs is

E(6) = |1 + k|

α6 201.0297(5) = 2171.930(5) kHz ,

(42)

(37), E(6)/Ehfs ≈
what could compared to the leading Fermi contact interaction in Eq.
0.000322. Between all the contributions to He3(23S1) hyperﬁne splitting in Eq.(1), H (5),
essentially the nuclear structure contribution, requires input from the nuclear physics to be
reliable evaluated. This is the reason we do not present ﬁnal theoretical predictions for hfs,
to compare with the precise measurement in [2]

Instead, we can compare our result indirectly by subtracting the ground state hfs of helium
ion as measured in [9]

Ehfs(He+) = −38.998(19) kHz .

(45)

In this way, nuclear structure contribution, of order m α5 cancels out, as well as the leading
Fermi contact interaction. What remain are electron–electron correlation eﬀects. Theoreti-
cal predictions for this diﬀerence are

(46)

We do not associate here the uncertainty due to higher order terms. A strong disagreement
of the theoretical result in Eq. (46) with the experimental one in Eq. (45) indicates that
the calculations presented here are incomplete or incorrect. The set of operators in H (6)
hfs is
the same as in hydrogen, and in fact we rederived for checking the hydrogenic result. We
have shown that there are no extra three-body terms due to internal cancellations. The
whole numerics was performed using multiple precision library by Bailey [10] with 48 digits
to avoid possible round-oﬀ error. The higher order QED corrections could not explain this
discrepancy, because it would require a very large coeﬃcient ∼ −4 α/π (Z α)6 ln(Z α)−2.
However the old calculations in [11] using an approximate Dirac-Hartree wave function, led
to the result which is in a much better agreement with experiment ∆Eth,old = −32(22) kHz.
Nevertheless, we think, this result might not reliable at the precision level of 3 %, which
is the discrepancy in question. The most probable explanation is the correction discovered
by Sternheim [12]. It is the second order contribution due to Fermi interaction H A
hfs in Eq.
(3) with singlet S intermediate states. It could be understood as a recoil correction since
it includes additional small factor m/M. The nonvanishing oﬀ–diagonal matrix element
between the singlet and triplet S-state is given by

H A

hfs → δH =

Z α
3 m M

and the correction is

σn · (σ1 − σ2) [δ3(r1) − δ3(r2)] (1 + k) (1 + a) ,

(47)

(48)

δE = h δH

(E − H)′ δH i .

One would expect the largest contribution coming from 21S0 state, since it has the closest
energy. Sternheim result is δE = −66.7(3) kHz, what nicely would explain the discrepancy
of 69 kHz. However, the inclusion of higher excited states, will lead to the inﬁnite result.
Moreover, this correction is partially included in hH (5)
hfs i, and only after proper subtraction
it becomes ﬁnite. The complete calculation of the recoil correction to helium hyperﬁne
splitting is beyond the scope of this work. Nevertheless, it would be a surprising result that
relativistic recoil correction which has additional factor m/M gives larger contribution than
the leading relativistic one, to the hyperﬁne structure diﬀerence between He and He+.

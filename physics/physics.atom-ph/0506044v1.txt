Abstract:

At low magnetic ﬁeld, metastability exchange optical pumping of helium-3 is known to provide
high nuclear polarizations for pressures around 1 mbar. In a recent paper, we demonstrated that
operating at 1.5 T can signiﬁcantly improve the results of metastability exchange optical pumping at
high pressures. Here, we compare the performances of two diﬀerent optical pumping lines at 1.5 T,
and show that either the achieved nuclear polarization or the production rate can be optimized.

INTRODUCTION

is necessary for all applications needing a dense sample.

Highly polarized helium-3 is used in various ﬁelds of
science,
for example, to perform magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of air spaces in human lungs [1, 2], or
to prepare spin ﬁlters for neutrons [3] and polarized tar-
gets for nuclear physics [4]. The most successful methods
presently used to polarize helium-3 are spin-exchange op-
tical pumping using alkali atoms [5, 6], and pure-helium
metastability exchange optical pumping [7, 8]. The ap-
plications have driven research towards improvement in
terms of photon eﬃciency, steady-state polarization, and
production rate, both for spin exchange optical pumping
[9], and metastability exchange optical pumping [3, 10].
The metastability exchange technique was demonstrated
by Colegrove, Schearer, and Walters over forty years ago
[7]. In standard conditions, metastability exchange op-
tical pumping is performed at low pressure (1 mbar) in
a guiding magnetic ﬁeld up to a few mT. Metastable
23S-state atoms are produced using a radiofrequency
discharge. They are optically pumped using the 23S-
23P transition at 1083 nm. The electronic polariza-
tion is transferred to the nuclei by hyperﬁne interaction.
Through metastability exchange collisions, nuclear po-
larization is transferred to ground state helium-3 atoms.
Metastability exchange optical pumping in standard con-
ditions provides in a few seconds high nuclear polariza-
tions (up to 90% at 0.7 mbar [11]). Unfortunately, the
achieved nuclear polarization rapidly drops down when
the helium-3 pressure exceeds a few mbar [10, 12]. There-
fore, a delicate polarization-preserving compression stage

We recently demonstrated that operating at 1.5 T can
signiﬁcantly improve the nuclear polarization achieved at
high pressures [13], using one of the most intense lines in
the 23S-23P absorption spectrum. Here, we show that
a diﬀerent choice of optical pumping transition can fur-
ther improve the steady-state polarization although the
production rate is slightly lower. We also describe more
precisely the experimental protocol, and demonstrate the
consistency of the optical absorption technique for dy-
namic measurement of the nuclear polarization in pres-
ence of the optical pumping laser.

A. Setup

Experiments are performed in the bore of a clinical
MRI scanner providing a homogeneous 1.5 T magnetic
ﬁeld. The experimental apparatus is shown in Fig.1. The
helium-3 gas is enclosed in a sealed cylindrical Pyrex cell,
5 cm in diameter and 5 cm in length. Cells ﬁlled with
pressure P =1.33, 8, 32, and 67 mbar of pure helium-3
are used. A radiofrequency high voltage applied to elec-
trodes on the outside of the cell generates a weak elec-
trical discharge in the gas.
It is used to populate the
23S state and maintain a metastable atoms density nm
in the range 1-8×1010 atoms/cm3, depending on the ap-
plied voltage and the gas pressure. The optical pumping
laser is a 50 mW single mode laser diode ampliﬁed by
a 0.5 W ytterbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer [14]. The laser
wavelength can be tuned by temperature control over
the entire spectrum of the 23S-23P transition of helium
(∼150 GHz at 1.5 T, see Fig.2). The circular polariza-
tion of the pump beam is obtained using a combination
of polarizing cube and quarter-wave retarding plate. The
pump beam is back-reﬂected after a ﬁrst pass in the cell
to enhance its absorption, and collected by a photodi-
ode to measure its absorption. The probe beam is pro-
vided by another single mode laser diode. It is attenu-
ated and linearly polarized perpendicularly to the mag-
netic ﬁeld. The absorption of probe and pump lasers are
measured using a modulation technique. The discharge
intensity is modulated at 133 Hz and the absorptions
are measured with lock-in ampliﬁers. The average values
of the transmitted probe and pump intensities are also
recorded. Laser sources and electronics remain several
meters away from the magnet bore in a low-ﬁeld region.

The structure of the 23S-23P transition and Zeeman
sublevels of helium-3 at 1.5 T is described in [13, 15]. In
our experiments, optical pumping is performed using one
of the two σ− pumping lines labeled f4 or f2 in the ab-
sorption spectrum displayed in Fig.2. The f4 line consists
of four unresolved transitions spreading over 1.31 GHz.
Given the Doppler width of helium-3 at room temper-
ature (2 GHz FWHM), it addresses simultaneously four
metastable sublevels A1 to A4 with mF =-3/2, -1/2 and
1/2, where mF is the magnetic quantum number for the
total angular momentum (see Fig.3). The f2 line (two
transitions split by 1.37 GHz) simultaneously addresses
sublevels A5 and A6 with mF =1/2 and 3/2. The pop-
ulation transfer into A5 and A6 for f4 pumping (or into
A1 to A4 for f2 pumping) occurs as follows: excitation

C. Optical measurement of nuclear polarization

The optical detection method used in our experiments
is based on absorption measurements using a weak probe
beam. This absorption technique does not need any cali-
bration and can be used at arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld, and
It relies on the fact that in the absence

of optical pumping, metastability exchange collisions im-
pose a spin temperature distribution for the metastable
populations amF ∝ eβmF , where 1/β is the spin temper-
ature in the 23S state related to the nuclear polarization
M in the ground state M = (eβ − 1)/(eβ + 1).

In practice, the probe laser frequency is swept over two
lines. Peaks amplitudes are precisely measured by a ﬁt
to a Voigt absorption proﬁle. The population ratio of
the two hyperﬁne sublevels addressed by the probe lines
is then found using the ﬁeld-dependent computed transi-
tion probabilities, and is used to calculate the spin tem-
perature. Hence, the ground-state nuclear polarization
M is inferred [15].

Polarization build-up is monitored in the presence of

FIG. 5: Example of dynamic monitoring of the nuclear polar-
ization M in the 8 mbar cell. Starting from a gas prepared
with M > 0 at time t = 0, the pump laser is tuned on the
f2 line with 0.5 W power. After reaching the steady-state nu-
clear polarization Meq = −0.75, the pump laser is turned oﬀ
at t = 1300 s, and the discharge-induced decay of the polar-
ization is observed.

the optical pumping beam. Therefore, the probe absorp-
tion measurements must involve metastable sublevels not
addressed by the optical pumping laser. In our conﬁgu-
ration (see Fig.3), the populations of sublevels A5 and
A6 (respectively A1 and A2) are measured for f4 (re-
spectively f2) pumping. Fig.4a shows typical absorption
spectra recorded in the absence and in the presence of the
pump laser. In the absence of the pump laser (solid line),
the spectrum is accurately ﬁt by the spectrum computed
assuming a spin temperature distribution (residue plot in
Fig.4b). The presence of the pump strongly aﬀects the
population distribution, with eﬃcient population trans-
fer from the pumped levels to A5 and A6 and modiﬁes
the absorption proﬁle (dashed line). However the ratio of
populations in sublevels A5 and A6 remains unaﬀected,
and an absorption measurement still accurately provides
the correct value for M.

An example of dynamical measurement of polarization
build-up and decay is shown in Fig.5 for the 8 mbar cell.
Several scans of the probe laser are recorded successively,
and the value of the nuclear polarization M is inferred as
a function of time. The gas is initially polarized to the
equilibrium positive value of M achieved with f4 pump-
ing. At time t = 0, the pump laser is tuned to the f2 line.
When the new steady-state polarization Meq is reached,
the pump laser is turned oﬀ and polarization decays by
discharge-induced relaxation.

Several experimental parameters inﬂuence the perfor-
mances of optical pumping: the cell geometry, the gas
pressure, the discharge conditions (voltage, electrodes

pumping transition, and the pump laser power. A sys-

pumping lines actually lies in the photon eﬃciency, de-
ﬁned as the number of polarized nuclei per photon ab-
sorbed by the gas. A simple calculation, based on the
average angular momentum transfer from polarized light
to atoms during one absorption-collisional redistribution-
spontaneous emission cycle, shows that the photon eﬃ-
ciency of f2 should be approximately twice that of f4.
This has been experimentally checked, at various laser
powers. Magnetization production rates for f2 pumping
are yet slightly lower due to the lower absorption of the
pump beam on this line with respect to f4.

tematic study of optical pumping using the f4 line has
been reported in [13]. Here, we focus on the compari-
son of optical pumping with f4 and f2 lines in the same
cells. We present selected results obtained with identical
discharge conditions for f4 and f2, using a 0.5 W pump
power.

The f2 line yields higher steady-state polarizations but
f4 allows pumping with signiﬁcantly shorter build-up
times (Fig.6). As a result, the magnetization produc-
tion rates Ra = P × Meq/tb are slightly lower for f2 (see
Table I). The main diﬀerence between the two optical

We have compared the performances of two diﬀerent
optical pumping lines at 1.5 T in helium-3 gas, at high
pressures (up to 67 mbar). The strongest line of the σ−
absorption spectrum (f4) yields the highest magnetiza-
tion production rates. However, the highest steady-state
nuclear polarizations (up to Meq = −0.75 at 8 mbar)
are achieved using a weaker line with higher photon eﬃ-
ciency. f2 pumping, requiring fewer absorbed photons to
achieve the same production rate, is thus advantageous
when long, optically thick pumping cells are used.

Given the structure of sublevels and optical transi-
tions, one could expect that the two most intense σ+
lines would be just as eﬃcient as the corresponding σ−
lines. Similar optical pumping performances have indeed
been obtained, although no systematic comparison has
been carried out.

An analysis of all optical pumping data collected at
1.5 T is under way using a detailed model of metastability
exchange optical pumping in high ﬁeld conditions, and
will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.

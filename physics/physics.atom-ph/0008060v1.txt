Abstract

Absorption of radiation from the sodium dimer molecular states correlating

to Na(3s)-Na(3s) is investigated theoretically. Vibrational bound and contin-
uum transitions from the singlet X 1Σ+
u and
B 1Πu states and from the triplet a 3Σ+
g and
c 3Πg states are studied quantum-mechanically. Theoretical and experimen-

g state to the ﬁrst excited A 1Σ+
u state to the ﬁrst excited b 3Σ+

tal data are used to characterize the molecular properties taking advantage

of knowledge recently obtained from ab initio calculations, spectroscopy, and

ultra-cold atom collision studies. The quantum-mechanical calculations are

carried out for temperatures in the range from 500 to 3000 K and are com-

pared with previous calculations and measurements where available.

I. INTRODUCTION

Vast amounts of experimental spectroscopic data on the electronic states and ro-

vibrational levels of the sodium dimer are available and many theoretical studies have been

performed. For example, Ref. [1] presents an extensive bibliography summarizing a variety

of work dating from 1874 to 1983. Nevertheless, recent developments in atom trapping and

cold atom spectroscopy have led to improved atomic and molecular data through combi-

nations of cold collision data, photoassociation spectroscopy, and magnetic ﬁeld induced

Feshbach resonance data [2–8].

Now that very reliable information is available, calculations of absorption spectra at high

temperatures become feasible. Absorption coeﬃcients in absolute units for a gas of sodium

atoms and molecules at temperatures from 1070 to 1470 K were measured over the range

of wavelengths from 350 to 1075 nm by Schlejen et al. [9]. They performed semiclassical

calculations involving the relevant molecular singlet and triplet transitions, however, those

previous calculations do not fully reproduce their experimental spectra [9]. The present

work is concerned with the absorption involving two ground Na (3s) atoms and a ground

Na (3s) atom and an excited Na (3p) atom, corresponding to transitions between the singlet
transitions from the X 1Σ+
u and B 1Πu states and the triplet transitions
g and c 3Πg states. We assembled and evaluated the available
from the a 3Σ+
data for the molecular system and calculated quantum-mechanically the absorption spectra

g state to the A 1Σ+

u to the b 3Σ+

at temperatures between 500 and 3000 K.

II. ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS

The thermally averaged absorption coeﬃcients kν for molecular spectra at wavelength ν
are obtained from the product of the thermally averaged cross sections and the molecular

density [10]. In turn, the molecular density can be expressed in terms of the atomic density

squared and the chemical equilibrium constant [11]. In the present study, we use the atomic
density-independent reduced absorption coeﬃcient, kν
n2
a

, where na is atomic density.

Four possible types of vibrational transitions between two electronic states can be iden-

tiﬁed: bound-bound (bb), bound-free (bf), free-bound (fb) and free-free (ﬀ) and quantum-

mechanical expressions for the reduced absorption coeﬃcient can be derived. The radial

wave function φ for a bound level, with vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, v and

J, is obtained from the Schr¨odinger equation for the relative motion of the nuclei,

where V (R) is the potential for the relevant electronic state labeled by the projection Λ of

the electronic orbital angular momentum on the internuclear axis, µ is the reduced mass of

the nuclei, and E is the eigenvalue of the bound level or the continuum energy.

For the temperatures of interest here, T ≤ 3000 K, the bound-bound reduced absorption

coeﬃcient from a vibration-rotation state of the lower electronic state (v ′′, J ′′, Λ′′) to the

vibration-rotation state of the upper electronic state (v ′, J ′, Λ′) is [10,12–14]

III. MOLECULAR DATA

The adopted singlet X 1Σ+

potential and the lower X 1Σ+
plotted in Fig. 1. The adopted triplet a 3Σ+

u , and B 1Πu potentials and the diﬀerences of the upper
g , A 1Σ+
g potential (diﬀerence potentials or transition energies) are
g , and c 3Πg potentials and the diﬀerence
potentials are plotted in Fig. 2. In the remainder of the section details on the construction

of the potentials are given. We use atomic units throughout.

A. The X 1Σ+

g potential

For R < 4 a0, we adopted a short range form a exp(−bR), with a = 2 702 514.0 cm−1 and
b = 2.797 131 ˚A−1 as given by Zemke and Stwalley [16]. Over the range of 4 < R < 30 a0 we
used the Inverse Perturbation Analysis (IPA) potential given by van Abeelen and Verhaar [7]

which is consistent with data from photoassociation spectroscopy, molecular spectroscopy,

and magnetic-ﬁeld induced Feshbach resonances in ultra-cold atom collisions. For the long

range form, we used

− C6/R6 − C8/R8 − C10/R10 − AR

7

2 α−1 exp(−2αR),

(8)

where C6 = 1 561 [2], C8 = 111 877, C10 = 11 065 000 [17], A = 1
80 , and α = 0.626 [7,18]. To
ﬁt the very accurate dissociation energy, 6 022.0286(53) cm−1, recently measured by Jones et

al. [19], a point at the potential minimum 5.819 460 a0 was added. The short and long-range
data were smoothly connected to the IPA values. Vibrational eigenvalues calculated with
our adopted potential agree for v ≤ 44 to within 0.1 cm−1 with published Rydberg-Klein-

Rees (RKR) values [16]. Our ﬁnal potential yielded an s-wave scattering length of 15 a0 in
satisfactory agreement with the accepted value of 19.1 ± 2.1 a0 [7].

B. The A 1Σ+

u potential

We used ab initio calculations given by Konowalow et al. [20] for values of R over the

range 3.8 a0 < R < 4.75 a0. We combined the RKR potential values over the range

4

2.522 19 ˚A< R < 7.204 14 ˚A given by Gerber and M¨oller [21] with the RKR potential
values over the range of 7.260 536 ˚A< R < 261.327 403 ˚A given by Tiemann, Kn¨ockel, and
Richling [22,23]. The data was connected to the long range form,

− C3/R3 − C6/R6 − C8/R8,

(9)

with the values of C3 = 12.26, C6 = 4 094 and C8 = 702 500 [24]. For R < 3.8 a0, the form
a exp(−bR) + c was used with the parameters a = 0.9532, b = 0.5061 and c = 0.104696

computed to smoothly connect to the RKR points. The adopted potential yields a value of
De = 8 297.5 cm−1 using Te = 14 680.682 cm−1 [21] and the atomic asymptotic energy of
16 956.172 cm−1 [25]. The calculated eigenvalues reproduce the input RKR values to within
0.4 cm−1. For the transition frequencies measured by Verma, Vu, and Stwalley [26] and by
Verma et al. [1] over a range of vibrational bands we ﬁnd typical agreement to about 0.4 cm−1
for J ′ values up to 50 increasing to 1 cm−1 for J ′ = 87. We also have good agreement with

less accurate measurements by Itoh et al. [27]. One precise transition energy measurement

is available: In a determination of the dissociation energy of the sodium molecule Jones et
al. [19] measured the value 18762.3902(30) cm−1 for the v ′ = 165, J ′ = 1 to v ′′ = 31, J ′′ = 0
transition energy. Our value of 18762.372 cm−1 is in excellent agreement.

C. The B 1Πu potential

The RKR potential of Kusch and Hessel [28] was used1 over the range of 2.655 5671 ˚A <
R < 5.173 513 4 ˚A. For the values of R in the ranges 2.581 ˚A < R < 2.646 0268 ˚A and
5.251 918 4 ˚A < R < 11.0 ˚A, we took the potential values from Tiemann [30]. We also took
his long-range form,

C3/R3 − C6/R6 + C8/R8 − a exp(−bR),

(10)

with C3 = 6.1486, C6 = 6490.5, C8 = 868135.2, a = 23.7011, and b = 0.7885. For
R < 2.581 ˚A, the form a exp(−bR) + c was used with the values a = 14.97332, b = 1.42983
and c = 0.0121935 chosen to give a smooth connection with the data from Tiemann.

The B 1Πu potential exhibits a barrier that has been studied extensively [21,29–31] and
the maximum value occurs around R = 13 a0 (6.9 ˚A) as shown in Fig. 1. We took De =

1 For this reference, we correct an apparent typographical error of 4.309 78 ˚A with 4.339 78 ˚A ob-

tained by comparison with RKR potential of Demtr¨oder and Stock [29].

2 676.16 cm−1 using Te = 20 319.19 cm−1 from Kusch and Hessel [28] and the barrier energy
371.93 cm−1 measured from dissociation given by Tiemann [30]. The calculated energy
23 393.524 cm−1 of the v ′ = 31, J ′ = 42 state with respect to the X 1Σ+
g state potential
minimum compares well to the measured value, 23 393.650 cm−1. Quasibound levels from

v ′ = 24 to v ′ = 33 for the several J ′ values observed by Vedder et al. [32] are reproduced
to within 0.1 cm−1 and calculated transition frequencies compare well, to within 0.5 cm−1,

with those measured by Camacho et al. [33].

D. The a 3Σ+

u potential

RKR potentials are available from Li, Rice, and Field [34] and Friedman-Hill and

Field [35] and a hybrid potential was constructed by Zemke and Stwalley [16] using var-

ious available data. An accurate ab initio study was carried out by Gutowski [3] for R
values between 2 and 12.1 ˚A and the resulting potential has well depth 176.173 cm−1 and
equilibrium distance 5.204 ˚A.

Our adopted potential consists of Gutowski’s potential connected to the long-range form
given in Eq. (8) with the values for C6, C8, C10 and α the same as for the X 1Σ+
g state, but
80 . For R < 2 ˚A the short range form a exp(−bR) was used with a = 1.4956
with A = − 1
and b = 0.79438 chosen to smoothly connect to the ab initio data. Our adopted potential

yields an s-wave scattering length of 65 a0 in agreement with the value 65.3 ± 0.9 of van
Abeleen and Verhaar [7]. Recently, a potential alternative to Gutowski’s was presented by

Ho et al. [36]. For the present study the two potentials are comparable—we will explore

their diﬀerences in a subsequent publication.

E. The b 3Σ+

g and c 3Πg potentials

We are unaware of empirical excited state triplet potentials but ab initio calculations

are available from Magnier et al. [37], Jeung [38] and Konowalow et al. [20]. Comparing the
available potentials, we found for the b 3Σ+
g state that the experimentally [39] determined
Te of 18 240.5 cm−1 and De of 4 755 cm−1 are closest to Magnier’s calculated values (Te of
18 117 cm−1 and De of 4 740.7 cm−1) compared with Jeung’s (Te of 18 400 cm−1 and De of
4 702.4 cm−1) and Konowalow et al .’s (De of 4 599 cm−1). Also, we found Magnier’s potential
gave the best agreement with experimental measurements [40] of the term diﬀerences of the
a 3Σ+
g state and, in the absence of
experimental data for the c 3Πg potential, we adopted Magnier’s calculated potentials over

g (v ′) vibrational transitions. For the b 3Σ+

u (v ′′) → b 3Σ+

6

the range of R values 5 < R < 52 a0. Over the range of R values 4.25 < R < 5 a0, we used
g and c 3Πg adopted potentials, the long-
potentials by Konowalow et al. [20]. For the b 3Σ+
range form was taken from Marinescu and Dalgarno [24] for R > 52 a0 and for R < 4.25 a0,
we used the form a exp(−bR) where the values are a = 55.7864 and b = 1.75934 for the
b 3Σ+

g potential and a = 2.67691 and b = 0.91547 for the c 3Πg potential.

F. Transition dipole moment functions

We used for the singlet transitions the ab initio calculations of Stevens et al. [41] over the

range 2 < R < 12 a0. For R > 12 the transition dipole moment functions were approximated
by a+b/r3, where a = 3.586 4 and b = 284.26 for X 1Σ+
u transitions and a = 3.5017
g → B 1Πu transitions. The parameter values for a were selected
and b = −142.13 for X 1Σ+
to match the short-range parts and those for b were from Marinescu and Dalgarno [24]. The
X 1Σ+
u dipole moment function was scaled with a factor of 1.008, as discussed
in Sec. IV A below. For the triplet transitions the ab initio calculations of Konowalow et

g → A 1Σ+

g → A 1Σ+

al. [42] were used over the range 4 < R < 100 a0.

IV. RESULTS

A. Lifetimes

In order to evaluate our assembled potential energy and transition dipole moment data
u and B 1Πu states and compare

we calculated lifetimes of ro-vibrational levels of the A 1Σ+

with prior studies.

Lifetimes for levels of the A 1Σ+

u state have been measured [26,43–45] and calcu-
lated [26,46]. In Fig. 3 we present a comparison of rotationally resolved lifetimes for levels
of the A 1Σ+
u state measured by Baumgartner et al. [45] with the present calculations. In
evaluating the lifetimes, we used the procedures described in Ref. [10]. When the transition

dipole moment function of Ref. [41] is multiplied by a factor of 1.008, agreement is generally
very good over the range 0 to 3500 cm−1 of available term energies. Our calculations are

also in good agreement with the rotationally unresolved measurement of Ducas et al. [43]

and the calculations using diﬀerent molecular data by Pardo [46].

Rotationally resolved lifetimes for the B 1Πu state have been measured by Demtr¨oder
found that the lifetimes for the B 1Πu state are sensitive to
the slope of the transition dipole moment function in the range of internuclear separation

et al. [47]. Demtr¨oder et al.

7

from, roughly, 4 < R < 10 a0 and they obtained an empirical value for the function that
we found to be in good agreement with the transition dipole moment function of Stevens et

al. [41]. Using the transition dipole moment function of Stevens et al., in turn, we ﬁnd good

agreement between our calculated lifetimes and experimental lifetime measurements [47], as

shown in Fig. 4. The ab initio dipole moment of Konowalow et al. [42] was found not to

reproduce the experimental lifetimes.

B. Absorption Coeﬃcients

Absorption spectra in the far-line wings of the Na(3s)-Na(3p) resonance lines are investi-

gated in terms of singlet and triplet molecular transitions. The blue wing consists of radiation
from X 1Σ+
g → A 1Σ+
u
and a 3Σ+
g transitions. There are few experimental studies [9,14,48] and that of
Schlejen et al. [9] is most relevant to our work. In this section, we compare our calculated

u → c 3Πg transitions and the red wing from X 1Σ+

g → B 1Πu and a 3Σ+
u → b 3Σ+

absorption coeﬃcients with the measurements of Schlejen et al. [9].

The theoretical spectra are assembled from four molecular band spectra over the wave-

length range 450–1000 nm excluding the region 589±2 nm around the atomic resonance

lines. The far line wings are calculated using Eqs. (2)–(7), with the data from Sec. III. In

the calculations, all the vibrational levels including quasi-bound levels with rotational quan-

tum numbers up to 250 are included. The maximum internuclear distance that is used for

integration of the transition dipole matrix element is approximately 100 a0 and the Numerov
integration used to obtain the energy-normalized continuum wave function is carried out to

100 a0 at which the wave function is matched to its asymptotic form. The bin size ∆ν used
for Eq. (2) was 10 cm−1 simulating the experimental resolution. Results for absolute absorp-

tion coeﬃcients computed with the quoted atomic densities and temperatures of Schlejen et

al [9] and shown in Fig. 5 compare very well with the four experimental spectra given by

Schlejen et al , given in Figure. 5 of Ref. [9]. The spectra show clearly that as temperature

increases, certain satellite features grow more apparent at 551.5 nm and 804 nm. These

satellites will be discussed in greater detail later in this section. The present calculations

reproduce ﬁne-scale ro-vibrational features present but unresolved in the measurements of

Ref. [9].

We also have calculated reduced absorption coeﬃcients at temperatures up to 3000 K
using the bin size ∆ν of 1 cm−1 for Eq. (2). The contributions of the four molecular bands

to the reduced absorption coeﬃcients are shown in Fig. 6 for three temperatures 1000 K,

2000 K and 3000 K. As can be seen by comparing columns (a) and (b) in Fig. 6, the singlet

8

transitions contribute more to the reduced absorption coeﬃcients in the far line wings and

the triplet transitions contribute more near the atomic resonance lines. We found that for

singlet transitions bound-bound and bound-free transitions are dominant over free-bound

and free-free transitions for the temperature range T ≤ 3000 K, thus accounting for the

“grassy” structure in Fig. 6(a). However, the free-bound and free-free contributions increase

rapidly with temperature. In contrast to the singlet transitions, the triplet transitions arise
mainly from free-bound and free-free transitions due to the shallow well of the initial a 3Σ+
u
state. Hence, the reduced absorption coeﬃcients in Fig. 6(b) do not exhibit much structure.

Because the density of bound molecules decreases rapidly with increasing temperature, the

reduced absorption coeﬃcient in the line wings due to the singlet transitions also decreases

rapidly with increasing temperature.

It should be noted that the scale of the reduced

absorption coeﬃcient at 1000 K is two orders of magnitude larger than the scale shown for

T = 2000 K and 3000 K.

Woerdman and De Groot [48] derived the reduced absorption coeﬃcient at 2000 K from
a discharge spectra. The measured values of 5 ± 1 × 10−37 cm−1 at 500 nm and 10 ± 1 ×
10−37 cm−1 at 551.5 nm are well-reproduced by our values of, respectively, 5 × 10−37 cm−1
and 11 × 10−37 cm−1 calculated with the bin size ∆ν of 5 cm−1 simulating the experimental

resolution obtained by Woerdman and De Groot [48].

The molecular absorption spectra contain “satellite” features around the energies where

the diﬀerence potentials possess local extrema [49,50]. For Na2 the satellite frequencies have
been studied [9,14,48,51] and the energies have been calculated using ab initio methods [42].
In the present work, we investigate the satellites arising from a 3Σ+
g → A 1Σ+
u ,
and a 3Σ+
g transitions with measured maximum intensities at, respectively, the
wavelengths 551.5 nm, 804 nm, and 880 nm. The calculated extrema of the diﬀerence

u → c 3Πg, X 1Σ+

u → b 3Σ+

potentials adopted in the present study occur at wavelengths at 548 nm, 809 nm and 913 nm,

however in the quantum-mechanical approach there is no well-deﬁned singularity.

We can use the quantum-mechanical theory to study satellite features in more detail and

as a function of temperature. In Fig. 7 we show calculated reduced absorption coeﬃcients
at three temperatures for the a 3Σ+
u transitions. The rich
ro-vibrational structure in the X 1Σ+
u satellite feature arises because the dominant
contributions are from bound-bound transitions; the structure is not reproduced by semi-
u → c 3Πg satellite feature is
classical theories [9]. In contrast, the smooth, structureless a 3Σ+
due mainly to free-free transitions, and consequently, the decrease of the satellite intensity

u → c 3Πg and X 1Σ+
g → A 1Σ+

g → A 1Σ+

with temperature is less severe. The slight discrepancy between the calculated wavelength

of 550 nm and the measured wavelength of 551.5 nm [48,52,53] for the peak intensity is

9

probably due to remaining uncertainties in the triplet potentials [36,54].

We also investigated the a 3Σ+

u → b 3Σ+

g → A 1Σ+

u and a 3Σ+

T ≤ 3000 K than the X 1Σ+

g satellite which is far weaker in intensity at
u → b 3Σ+
g
satellite arises primarily from free-bound transitions. The population density of atom pairs
with high continuum energies in the initial a 3Σ+
u state increases with temperature, see
Eq. (6), and more ro-vibrational levels in the b 3Σ+
g state are accessible through absorption
of radiation, as can be seen from the potential curves shown in Fig. 2(a). As a result, this

u → c 3Πg satellites. The a 3Σ+

satellite feature exhibits an increase in intensity with temperature.

In Fig. 8 calculated

absorption coeﬃcients for temperatures 1000, 1500, 2000 and 3000 K are plotted. The

satellite feature intensity was measured at 1470 K by Schlejen et al. [9]. They observed a

primary peak at 880 nm and a secondary peak at 850 nm, compared to our calculated values

at 1500 K of 890 nm and 860 nm, respectively. The 10 nm discrepancy in both peaks is
u and b 3Σ+
probably a result of uncertainties in the short range parts of our adopted a 3Σ+
g
potentials. Our calculations also demonstrate that the wavelengths of the peaks change with

temperature, see Fig. 8, and that the primary peak from quantum-mechanical calculations is

less prominent than that obtained from semiclassical calculations exhibited in Figures 6(c)

and 6(d) of Schlejen et al. [9]. Our calculated reduced absorption coeﬃcients appear to be

in excellent agreement with the reduced absorption coeﬃcients interpolated from Figures

6(a) and 6(b) of Schlejen et al. [9] using their quoted Na densities.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have carried out quantum-mechanical calculations of the reduced absorption coeﬃ-

cients in sodium vapor at high temperatures. Accurate molecular data are an important

ingredient. Comparisons with experiments [9,48] are good, but the theory is not limited

by the previous experimental resolution. Future work [55] will focus on comparisons of the

present theory and experiments currently on-going in our group [56].

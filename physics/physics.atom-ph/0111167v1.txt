We report on an original method, due to Majorana, leading to a semi-analytical series solution of the
Thomas-Fermi equation, with appropriate boundary conditions, in terms of only one quadrature.
We also deduce a general formula for such a solution which avoids numerical integration, but is
expressed in terms of the roots of a given polynomial equation.

PACS numbers: 31.15.Bs, 31.15.-p, 02.70.-c

In 1928 Majorana found an interesting semi-analytical
solution of the Thomas-Fermi equation [1] which, unfor-
tunately, remained unpublished and unknown until now
(see [2]). We set forth here a concise study of such a so-
lution in view of its potential relevance in atomic physics
as well as in nuclear physics (as, for example, in some
questions related to nuclear matter in neutron stars [3]).
The problem is to ﬁnd the Thomas-Fermi function ϕ(x)
obeying the diﬀerential equation:

To be deﬁnite, throughout this paper we will use a prime
′ or a dot ˙ to denote derivatives with respect to x or t,
respectively. The strategy adopted by Majorana is to
perform a double change of variables:

x , ϕ(x)

t , u(t)

(6)

−→
where the novel unknown function is u(t). The relation
connecting the two sets of variables (assumed to be in-
vertible) has a diﬀerential nature, that is:

with the boundary conditions:

ϕ′′ =

ϕ3/2
√x

ϕ(0) = 1

ϕ(

) = 0 .

∞

ϕ =

144
x3

.

An exact particular solution of Eq. (1) satisfying, how-
ever, only the condition (3), was discovered by Sommer-
feld [4]:

This can be regarded as an asymptotic expansion of the
desired solution, and Sommerfeld himself considered a
“correction” (in some sense) to Eq. (4) in such a way
to take into account the condition (3). However, this
“corrected” approximate solution had a divergent ﬁrst
derivative for x = 0 [4].
As will be clear below, Majorana solution can be consid-
ered as a modiﬁcation of Eq. (4) as well, but the method
followed by him is extremely original and very diﬀerent
from the one used by Sommerfeld.
Let us consider solutions of the Thomas-Fermi equation
(1) which are expressed in parametric form:

x = x(t)

ϕ = ϕ(t)

.

t = t(x, ϕ)

u = u(ϕ, ϕ′)

.

(7)

(8)

(9)

In such a way the second order diﬀerential equation (1)
for ϕ is transformed into a ﬁrst order equation for u.
Note, however, that in general Eqs. (7) are implicit equa-
tions for t and u, since x and ϕ depend on them (one is
looking for parametric solutions in terms of the parame-
ter t and the unknown function u). For the speciﬁc case
of the Thomas-Fermi equation, Majorana introduced the
following transformation:

t = 144−1/6 x1/2 ϕ1/6

u =

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

ϕ−4/3 ϕ′

.

Observe that Eq. (8) is reminiscent of the Sommerfeld
solution, since it can be cast into the form:

ϕ =

144
x3 t6
The diﬀerential equation for u(t) is obtained by taking
the t

We have now to express the quantity ˙xϕ1/3 in terms of

where:

The condition (2) implies, from Eqs. (8),(9), that t = 0

where ϕ′
ﬁed by u(t) for the univocal solution of Eq. (17) is ob-
tained from the boundary condition (3) by inserting the
Sommerfeld asymptotic expansion (4) into Eqs. (8),(9).
For x

we have t = 1 and

→ ∞

u(1) = 1 .

(19)

We then easily recognize that the branch of u(t) giving
the Thomas-Fermi function (in parametric form) is the
one between t = 0 and t = 1. In this interval we look for
the solution of Eq. (17) by using a series expansion in
powers of the variable τ = 1

u = a0 + a1 τ + a2 τ 2 + a3 τ 3 + . . .

(20)

From the condition (19) we immediately have:

a0 = 1 .

(21)

The other coeﬃcients are obtained by an iterative for-
mula coming from the substitution of (20) into Eq. (17):

(we have explicitly used that a−1 = 0), with m =
0, 1, 2, 3, . . .. The equation (25) for m = 0:

(a0 −

1) [a1 −

8 (a0 + 1)] = 0

is identically satisﬁed due to Eq. (21). For m = 1 we
have a second degree algebraic equation for a1:

of which we have to choose the smallest root (we are
performing a perturbative expansion):

a2
1 −

18 a1 + 8 = 0

a1 = 9

The remaining coeﬃcients are determined, using Eqs.
(21) and (28), by linear relations. In fact excluding the
cases with m = 0, 1, after some algebra Eq. (25) can be
written as:

am =

the interval [0, 1] for τ , since the series made of the coef-

The numeric values of the ﬁrst 20 coeﬃcients are reported
in Table I. Given the function u(t) we have now to look
for the parametric solution x = x(t), ϕ = ϕ(t) of the
Thomas-Fermi equation. To this end let us put:

ϕ(t) = exp

(cid:27)

where w(t) is an auxiliary function to be determined in
terms of u(t), and the condition (2) (or ϕ(t = 0) = 1) is
automatically satisﬁed. By inserting Eq. (31) into Eq.
(9) and using (16) we immediately ﬁnd:

w =

Summing up, the parametric solution of Eq. (1) with the
boundary conditions (2), (3) takes the form:

and u(t) is given by the series expansion in (20) with
the coeﬃcients determined by (21), (28) and (29). Eq.
(33) represents the celebrated Majorana solution of the
Thomas-Fermi equation; it is given in terms of only one
quadrature ∗.
We have performed numerically the integration in (34)
stopping the series expansion in (20) at the terms with

n = 10 and n = 20, respectively, and compared the para-
metric solutions thus obtained from (33) with the exact
(numerical) solution of the Thomas-Fermi equation. We
found that the two Majorana solutions approximate (for
excess) the exact solution with relative errors of the order
of 0.1% and 0.01%, respectively.
We can also obtain an approximate (by defect) analytic
solution by inserting the series expansion (20) into the
expression (34):

In Fig. 1 we compare the above solution with the exact

More in general, we can truncate the series in (35) to
a certain power τ k and thus the integrand function is
approximated by a rational function:

Let us then assume that the roots τi (i = 1, 2, . . . , k) of
the polynomial in the denominator,

Q(τi) = 0 ,

(41)

are known, so that we can decompose the function F (t)
in a sum of simple rational functions †:

∗Eq. (33) is, probably, the major result of this paper and was
obtained by Majorana. What follows is, instead, an original
further elaboration of the material presented above

†For simplicity we are also assuming that all the zeros of
Q(τ ) are simple roots, as it is likely in the present case. How-
ever, the generalization to the case in which multiple roots
are present is straightforward.

Obviously, using the method described above, the exact
result is recovered in the limit k
. This procedure
can, however, be employed for getting approximate but
accurate solutions of the Thomas-Fermi equation since,
as it is clear from above, we have translated a numer-
ical integration problem (see Eq. (34)) into the one of
a numerical search for the roots of the polynomial Q(τ ).
Note also that we already know one of such roots (namely,
τ1 = 0) given the particular form of Q(τ ). This implies
that, since the general solution of a fourth-degree poly-
nomial equation in terms of radicals is known, from (46)
and (47) we can get an analytic approximate solution by
considering terms in the series in (35) up to order O(τ 5),
thus obtaining a certainly much better approximation to
Eq.
(39). We do not report here the
explicit form of such a solution because of its very long
expression.
Summarizing,
in this paper we have reported on an
original method, due to Majorana, forwarding a semi-
analytical solution of the Thomas-Fermi equation (1)
with boundary conditions (2), (3). The procedure ap-
plies as well to diﬀerent boundary conditions, although
the constraint (2) is always automatically satisﬁed. This
corresponds to physical situations present in atomic as
well as in nuclear physics. We have further studied the
Majorana series solution thus obtaining a general formula
whose degree of approximation is limited by the one for
searching roots of a given polynomial rather than to the
one for integrating a rational function.
The method used by Majorana for solving the Thomas-
Fermi equation can be generalized in order to study a
large class of ordinary diﬀerential equations, but this will
be discussed elsewhere.

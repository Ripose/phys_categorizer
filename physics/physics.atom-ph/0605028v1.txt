We report on the origin of fragmentation of ultracold atoms observed on a permanent magnetic
ﬁlm atom chip. A novel technique is used to characterize small spatial variations of the magnetic
ﬁeld near the ﬁlm surface using radio frequency spectroscopy of the trapped atoms. Direct obser-
vations indicate the fragmentation is due to a corrugation of the magnetic potential caused by long
range inhomogeneity in the ﬁlm magnetization. A model which takes into account two-dimensional
variations of the ﬁlm magnetization is consistent with the observations.

An atom chip is designed to manipulate magnetically
trapped ultracold atoms near a surface using an arrange-
ment of microfabricated wires or patterned magnetic ma-
terials [1]. Since the realization of Bose-Einstein conden-
sates (BECs) on atom chips [2, 3], pioneering experiments
have studied single-mode propagation along waveguides
[4], transport and adiabatic splitting of a BEC [5] and
recently on-chip atom interferometry [6, 7]. Permanent
magnets are particularly attractive for atom chips as they
can provide complex magnetic potentials while suppress-
ing current noise that causes heating and limits the life-
time of trapped atoms near a surface [8]. To date, per-
manent magnet atom chips have been developed with a
view to study one-dimensional quantum gases [9, 10], de-
coherence of BEC near surfaces [8, 11], hybrid magnetic
and optical trapping conﬁgurations [12], and self biased
all-magnetic potentials [13]. It has been found, however,
that in addition to current noise, atom chips have other
limitations, as undesired spatial magnetic ﬁeld variations
associated with the current-carrying wires or magnetic
materials act to fragment the trapped atoms.

In previous work, fragmentation of atoms trapped near
current-carrying wires was traced to roughness of the
wire edges that causes tiny current deviations [14, 15].
This introduces a spatially varying magnetic ﬁeld com-
ponent parallel to the wire which corrugates the bottom
of the trap potential. While more advanced microfabri-
cation techniques have been used to produce wires with
extremely straight edges, thereby minimizing fragmenta-
tion [16], the ﬁrst experiments with permanent magnet
atom chips have now also indicated the presence of signif-
icant fragmentation [17, 18]. This has motivated further
work towards understanding the mechanisms that cause
fragmentation near magnetic materials.

In this Letter we report on the origin of fragmentation
near the surface of a permanent magnetic ﬁlm atom chip.
To characterize the magnetic ﬁeld near the ﬁlm surface
we have developed a new technique which combines preci-
sion radio frequency (RF) spectroscopy of trapped atoms
with high spatial resolution. This allows sensitive and in-

trinsically calibrated measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld
landscape to be made over a large area. We ﬁnd the frag-
mentation originates from long range inhomogeneity in
the ﬁlm magnetization and has characteristics that dif-
fer from those observed for current-carrying wire atom
chips. To account for the observations we have devel-
oped a model for the spatial decay of random magnetic
ﬁelds from the surface due to inhomogeneity in the ﬁlm
magnetization.

A schematic diagram of a basic permanent magnetic
ﬁlm atom chip is shown in Fig. 1. Our atom chip consists
of a Tb6Gd10Fe80Co4 ﬁlm on a 300 µm thick glass-slide
substrate [11]. The edge of the substrate is polished to
optical quality prior to ﬁlm deposition. Scanning pro-
ﬁlometer measurements on similarly prepared substrates
indicate that the residual edge roughness is less than
50 nm and the top surface is extremely smooth. The
substrate is sputter-coated with a multilayer magneto-
optical ﬁlm (6 × 150 nm TbGdFeCo and 6 × 140 nm Cr)
and a gold overlayer (100 nm), and the ﬁlm topology
accurately follows that of the polished substrate. The
deposited ﬁlm has been analyzed using a SQUID mag-
netometer and a magnetic force microscope (MFM) and
has excellent magnetic properties [19]. The ﬁlm is then
magnetized perpendicular to the surface by a magnetic
ﬁeld of 1 T and afterwards is magnetically homogeneous

within the sensitivity of the MFM. A second glass slide,
coated with a non-magnetic gold ﬁlm, completes the re-
ﬂective atom chip surface (Fig. 1). Both substrates are
then epoxied to a 500 µm thick silver foil current-carrying
structure which is used for loading ultracold atoms into
the permanent magnet microtrap, to provide weak longi-
tudinal conﬁnement, and as an in-built radio frequency
antenna.

At the edge of the perpendicularly magnetized ﬁlm
a ﬁeld is produced that is analogous to that of a thin
current-carrying wire aligned with the ﬁlm edge (Ief f =
0.2 A) [11]. A magnetic microtrap is formed by the ﬁeld
from the ﬁlm, a uniform magnetic ﬁeld Bbias, and two
In the experiment 2 × 108
current-carrying end wires.
87Rb atoms are collected in a mirror magneto-optical
trap located 5 mm from the surface. These atoms are op-
tically pumped to the |F = 2, mF = +2i hyperﬁne state
and subsequently transferred to a magnetic trap formed
by a Z-shaped current-carrying wire and Bbias. A prelim-
inary RF evaporative cooling stage is used to reduce the
cloud temperature below 5 µK. The remaining atoms are
then transferred to the magnetic ﬁlm microtrap by adia-
batically reducing the current through the Z-shaped wire
to zero. The ﬁnal values of Bbias vary from 0.2 mT to
0.8 mT, so the transverse trap frequency varies between
2π × 410 Hz and 2π × 1500 Hz while the trap position y0
ranges from 200 µm to 50 µm from the surface. The end-
wires are operated at 0.5 A such that the trap depth is
∼100 µK and the elongated cloud of atoms extends across
5 mm of the atom chip surface to allow measurement of
the magnetic potential.

The narrow energy distribution of ultracold atoms is
an inherent advantage when used as a probe of weak po-
tentials.
In particular, the equilibrium distribution of
trapped atoms has been used to image magnetic ﬁelds

2

near test wires with high sensitivity and high spatial res-
olution [20, 21]. In parallel, RF spectroscopy has been
used as a precise and powerful method for investigating
the properties of cold atom clouds [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. In
this paper we describe a new technique using RF spec-
troscopy of ultracold atoms to accurately proﬁle small
magnetic ﬁeld variations near the magnetic ﬁlm surface.
A spatially uniform RF ﬁeld of frequency ν is applied
perpendicular to the trap axis to resonantly outcouple
atoms to untrapped magnetic states at positions where
gF µB|B(x, y, z)| = hν. The RF ﬁeld is swept using a
single frequency ramp (∼0.2 MHz/s) from 2 MHz to a
ﬁnal cut-oﬀ frequency νf ranging between 1.4 MHz and
0.5 MHz. The Rabi frequency of the RF transition is
2π × 0.5 kHz, high enough to ensure that atoms with
total energy greater than hν are removed from the trap
with high probability and that regions of the potential
where gF µB|B(x, y, z)| ≥ hν thereafter remain unpopu-
lated. During the early stages of the RF sweep the cloud
undergoes some evaporative cooling as the in-trap colli-
sion rate is high enough to allow rethermalization. At the
end of the sweep the resonant frequency approaches that
corresponding to the trap bottom and the cloud becomes
signiﬁcantly truncated by the RF ﬁeld.

Immediately after the sweep, Bbias is switched oﬀ to
accelerate the atoms away from the ﬁlm surface in the
remaining permanent magnetic ﬁeld gradient. The lon-
gitudinal density distribution is unperturbed during the
1 ms expansion time and is an accurate representation
of the in-trap distribution. A resonant absorption image
is then recorded by a CCD with a spatial resolution of
5 µm. A series of absorption images for diﬀerent val-
ues of νf is shown in Fig. 2. Noticeable fragmentation
is observed when νf is reduced below 1.3 MHz (Fig. 2a).
For νf ∼ 0.9 MHz the density distribution becomes trun-
cated by the RF ﬁeld and regions of the atomic density
decrease to zero (Fig. 2b). Reducing νf further results in
well separated clumps of atoms which are found only in
the lowest potential wells (Fig. 2c, d).

For a quantitative analysis we assume that the full
trapping potential can be expressed in terms of the trans-
verse conﬁnement and the corrugated longitudinal poten-
tial mF gF µB|Bz(z)| [15]. The atomic distribution in the
trap immediately after the RF sweep is described by a
truncated Boltzmann distribution [23, 27]. To extract
|Bz(z)|, the integrated atomic density as a function of
νf is ﬁtted for each position z to the truncated thermal
distribution function (Fig. 2e),

of the magnetic ﬁlm. A cloud of atoms positioned 50 µm
from the surface of the magnetic ﬁlm and 100 µm from
the edge is signiﬁcantly fragmented, while a cloud po-
sitioned 50 µm above the non-magnetic gold ﬁlm does
not exhibit atomic density variations. This observation
conﬁrms that the magnetic ﬁeld variations originate from
the magnetic material itself and not from imperfections
along the edge of the ﬁlm.

where T is a ﬁt parameter, which characterizes the non-
equilibrium distribution during truncation. We note that
this model does not appropriately describe regions of the
potential where the atomic density is large, such as the
bottom of the potential wells. To extract the magnetic
potential in these areas we ﬁt Eq. 1 over values of νf
that excludes high atomic density. After reconstruct-
ing the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle the eﬀect of the end-wires
is subtracted. The statistical uncertainty in the mea-
surement is approximately 0.1 µT, which is mainly at-
tributed to ﬂuctuations of external magnetic ﬁelds. With
appropriate magnetic shielding the expected sensitivity
of the technique is limited by the power broadened RF
linewidth required to eﬀectively outcouple atoms.

Complete magnetic ﬁeld proﬁles are given for several
distances from the ﬁlm in Fig. 3. Firstly, the ampli-
tude and structure of the corrugated potential are con-
stant from day to day; however the amplitude increases
as the trap is positioned closer to the surface, with an
approximate power law dependence given by y−a, where
a = 1.8 ± 0.3. For y0 > 100 µm the potential has a char-
acteristic period of about 390 µm, signiﬁcantly longer
than that commonly observed near electroplated wires
[15, 28]. Closer to the ﬁlm, additional corrugations ap-
pear with a characteristic period of about 170 µm. These
y-dependent characteristics of the potential have allowed
time-dependent manipulation of BECs at particular in-
teresting regions of the disordered potential [18].

We have found that the amplitude of the corrugated
potential is not consistent with magnetostatic calcula-
tions based on ﬂuctuations of the ﬁlm edge (Fig. 4),
suggesting that the cause of fragmentation may be spa-
tial variations of the magnetization within the body of
the ﬁlm. To investigate this, a second bias ﬁeld is ap-
plied in the y direction to bring the trap closer to the

characteristic feature size d = 5 µm and ∆M/Ms ≃ 0.4.

of which, we are most interested in the magnetic ﬁeld
component Bz(x, y, z) that corrugates the bottom of the
trapping potential. Using a standard approach incorpo-
rating the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the ran-
dom magnetization N (kx, kz) and the magnetic scalar
potential we obtain an expression for the Bz component
of the corrugated magnetic ﬁeld. In the case of a mag-
netic ﬁlm occupying a half-plane with the edge at x = 0
(Fig. 1) and arbitrary magnetization noise we have, for
heights greater than the ﬁlm thickness,

inhomogeneity and d is the characteristic feature size of
the domain structure. For x = 0 the model predicts that
the corrugated magnetic ﬁeld component decays with a
y−2 dependence, consistent with our experimental result.
This behavior can also be compared with the more rapid
decay (∝ y−2.5) expected for white noise ﬂuctuations of
the edge of current-carrying wires [14, 15]. Film edge
ﬂuctuations are expected to produce corrugations three
orders of magnitude smaller than that observed in the
experiments (Fig. 4). The model also predicts the fast
decay of the corrugated magnetic ﬁeld away from the ﬁlm
edge for x < 0.

In Fig. 4 the experimental results are compared with
the model with relevant energy scales indicated by dot-
ted lines. The characteristic feature size and distribution
function of the domain structure has been inferred from
MFM measurements of a demagnetized TbGdFeCo ﬁlm
and is found to have close to white noise characteristics
with d ≈ 5 µm. The best ﬁt of Eq. 4 to the data is found

originate from reversal of a small number of magnetic
domains (My(x, z) = ±Ms) then we conclude that the
mean magnetization of the ﬁlm is 0.9Ms.

The TbGdFeCo magnetic ﬁlm was originally chosen
for its desirable magnetic properties including a large co-
ercivity (µ0Hc = 0.32 T) and a high Curie temperature
(Tc ∼300◦C) [19]. We attribute the observed inhomo-
geneity to deterioration of the magnetic ﬁlm experienced
during the vacuum bake-out (140 ◦C over 4 days) despite
the relatively high Curie temperature of our ﬁlm. This
conclusion is consistent with reports of reduced perpen-
dicular anisotropy found for similar ﬁlms after annealing
at temperatures above 100◦C [29, 30] and with our own
measurements on similar ﬁlms.

In conclusion, trapped ultracold atoms are extremely
sensitive to small magnetic ﬁeld variations found near the
surface of a permanent magnetic ﬁlm. These variations
corrugate the longitudinal trapping potential and result
in fragmentation of atomic density. We have developed
the technique of spatially resolved RF spectroscopy as a
powerful method for accurately mapping small magnetic
ﬁeld variations near the surface of the magnetic ﬁlm. A
simple model accounts for spatial inhomogeneity of the
ﬁlm magnetization and agrees well with the observations.
The development of new permanent magnet atom chips
will require additional research aimed at further optimiz-

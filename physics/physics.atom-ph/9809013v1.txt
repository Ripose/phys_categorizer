Coulomb and spin-orbit interaction matrix elements
in dd′ conﬁguration

Abstract. The d2d′ conﬁguration is analysed in group-theoretical terms. Starting
from the table given by Condon and Odabasi (1980) for the conﬁguration d2d′,
we determine a set of convenient group-theoretical basis states, and rewrite the
Coulomb matrix elements in terms of this new basis. Linear combinations from
the diﬀerent parts of the Coulomb operators are formed such that they have simple
group transformation properties in our scheme. The sequence of groups that we use is
U (20)
SOS(3)
⊃
⊃
SOL(3), where T denotes the isospin of ˇSimonis et al (1984), in
SOT (3)
which electrons with the same angular momentum l but diﬀerent principle quantum
numbers n are accommodated by introducing the eigenvalue MT of T0. Using the
Wigner-Eckart theorem and selection rules on the higher symmetry groups, the tables
of the Coulomb and spin-orbit matrix elements for the reconstituted operators (with
simple group transformation properties) are much simpliﬁed in terms of these basis
states.

1. Introduction

The conﬁguration d2d′ has been observed in the excited spectra of some rather common
atoms and ions. For instance, from the data of Sugar and Corliss (1985), Sc I, Ti II,
V III and Cr IV all have excited levels with the conﬁguration 3d24d observed.
In the
case of vanadium and chromium, almost all the 27 possible spectroscopic terms of the
conﬁguration 3d24d were found and their energies measured; for vanadium, a few 3d25d
levels were seen as well. In addition to the d2d′ systems, the present work also applies
to commonly found systems of the type d8d′. For example, 3d84d has been observed in
Co I and Ni II (Sugar and Corliss, 1985). For nickel, all 27 possible spectroscopic terms
of the conﬁguration 3d84d have been found, as well as some levels of 3d85d, 3d86d, 3d87d
and 3d88d.

Condon and Odabasi (1980) calculated the Coulomb matrix elements of d2d′ using
the classical methods. Their basis couples the two equivalent electrons (d2) to an
intermediate state [S′]L′, to which the d′ electron is coupled to give the ﬁnal state [S]L.

quite good, as the d′ electron usually interacts rather weakly with the other d electrons.
As one can check from the data for V III and Cr IV (Sugar and Corliss, 1985), there is
not a substantial mixing of the states in this basis except for 2P, 2D and 2F .

Instead of this physical basis, we choose to use a diﬀerent one that has simple
transformation properties under higher symmetry groups. There are advantages in doing
so, particularly when they are taken as intermediate states in a perturbation expansion
(see, for example, Hansen et al 1997). In that case, the sum over intermediate states that
appear render the choice of basis irrelevant to the physical properties being investigated.
And certainly, if we introduce higher symmetry groups into the analysis, even though
they might not give “good” quantum numbers, in the sense that they do not commute
with the full Hamiltonian, they give simple results as far as the computation of matrix
elements is concerned. The selection rules, and especially the Wigner-Eckart theorem,
when applied to higher groups, strikingly reduce the amount of calculation and expose
new mathematical structure.

Other than matrix elements among the states of the d2d′ conﬁguration itself, our
interest in conﬁguration interaction (CI) means that we will also need the matrix
elements that connect d2d′ to d3. The physical basis that is commonly used for d3
coincides with the group-theoretical basis that utilizes the higher unitary and symplectic
groups U(10) and Sp(10). For this reason, it is best to use the same group-theoretical
basis for the conﬁguration d2d′ as that needed to study the conﬁguration interaction
between d3 and d2d′. Once again, the Wigner-Eckart theorem and selection rules for the
higher symmetry groups are invaluable.

The isospin formalism (ˇSimonis et al 1984, Kaniauskas et al 1987) that we will
introduce into our work also provides a very useful setting for the study of CI. In the
isospin formalism, the states in d3 and d2d′ that carry the same group labels belong
to the same isospin multiplet, but with diﬀerent isospin z-component MT . We can
therefore easily obtain the CI matrix elements from the ones for d2d′ if everything, the
states and the operators, have simple transformation properties under the symmetry
groups. These considerations give us strong reasons to abandon the physical basis for
d2d′ and turn to the group-theoretical one instead.

As explained earlier, this provides a set of good physical states, but there are also good
reasons to use an alternative basis which carries a set of simple group labels, that is,
irreducible representations (irreps). The groups that we have chosen are

The groups U(5) and SO(5) are based on the ﬁve orbital states of a d (or d′) electron; the
group U(10) utilizes the spin of the electron as well. Another more common alternative

where the symplectic group Sp(10) is closely related to the seniority scheme widely used
in atomic spectroscopy. It is, however, felt that the idea of seniority might not as useful
in conﬁgurations with inequivalent electrons. At least not in the way we used it in
conﬁgurations of equivalent electrons.

To simplify the notation, we use square brackets for unitary group labels, with a

The mapping of states from the classical basis to the new basis was worked out by
Judd (1997) and the author, and is given in table 1. The reader should for the moment
disregard the ﬁrst superscript labeling each state. That is the isospin label which will be
introduced later in section 4. If the alternative scheme involving the symplectic group
Sp(10) is used instead, almost all of the states in the ﬁrst column of table 1 corresponds
to a single state in that scheme. The only mixing comes from a pair of 2D states that
share the same labels in U(10) and SOS(3)
SO(5). They are given on the last two
lines in table 1.

to the new basis without diﬃculty. At the same time, we also followed Judd (1998)
and Racah (1954) and take speciﬁc linear combinations of the two-electron Coulomb
operators so that they transform irreducibly under the action of the group SO(5).

The full two-body Coulomb interaction contains three distinct parts. One involves
only the d-electrons (or only the d′-electrons, if we had more than one d′-electron.) The
other two are the direct and exchange parts that involve one d and one d′ electron.

We can write the perturbing Hamiltonian as

H1 =

fk(d, d)F k(d, d) + fk(d, d′)F k(d, d′) + gk(d, d′)Gk(d, d′)

=

eiEi + f iF i + giGi

where the sums run over k = 0, 2, 4 and i = 0, 1, 2. The F k and Gk are the usual
direct and exchange radial integrals, and the matrix elements of fk(d, d′) and gk(d, d′) in
d2d′ in the classical basis are tabulated by Condon and Odabasi (1980). The operators
e0, e1 and e2 on the second line, constructed from the operators fk(d, d) by Judd (1998)
and Racah (1954) independently, transform irreducibly as (00), (00) and (22) of SO(5)
respectively. They are given by

3.1. The irreps of the Coulomb operators

As can be seen from table 1, all the states have deﬁnite group labels with respect to
the symmetry groups in (2). We have now to determine the transformation properties
of the nine operators ei, f i and gi. Of course, we know that they are scalars in the
spin and orbital spaces. As mentioned in the previous section, these nine operators thus

The group labels for the nine operators ei, f i and gi can thus be written down
rapidly as given in table 4. (Once again, the reader can ignore the isospin superscript
for the time being.) The only ones that need explanation are the three ei operators as
well as f 0 and g0. The three equivalent electron operators ei do not contain the irrep
2]10 of U(10) because the two creation operators (and likewise, the annihilation
[2
operators) must form an antisymmetric product in U(10). So no [2
2]10 appears. In
fact, they were examined by Judd and Leavitt (1986), and it is found that e0 belongs
to [0]10 of U(10), e2 belongs to [11
11]10.
For the operators e0, f 0 and g0, they can be shown to be U(10) scalars rather
easily. From the expressions (8a) through (8c), it is a simple exercise to show that they
commute with all the 100 generators d†µdν + d′†µ d′ν of the group U(10). (See section 4 for
further discussion of the group generators.) Hence, they are all U(10) scalars.

3.2. Selection rules and the Wigner-Eckart Theorem

With the group labels for the operators worked out, we are now in a position to
appreciate the use of the new group-theoretical basis. We can look at the situation
on diﬀerent group levels. First of all, the six SO(5) scalars operators e0, e1, f 0, f 1,
g0 and g1 cannot connect states with diﬀerent SO(5) labels. And for the other three
operators e2, f 2 and g2 which belong to (22), the Kronecker products for SO(5) account
for all the vanishing matrix elements one can ﬁnd in table 2 on those three columns.

When we apply the Wigner-Eckart theorem on the group U(10), we expect a lot of
simple proportionality relations among the diﬀerent operators. Between the operators

Most of the proportionality relations above are the result of the Wigner-Eckart
theorem at work on the group U(10). To demonstrate, let us use a few examples.
For i = 2 in equation (9a), since [111]10 ×
11]10 once and no
2]10 part) of the
2]10 appears (see table 6), only the [11
[2
−
operators f 2 and g2 contributes to their matrix elements. Hence, by the Wigner-Eckart
theorem, they should be proportional to each other, and the proportionality constant
turns out to be unity. Analogous argument applies to explain the proportionality
relations in (9b), (10a) and (10b) for i = 0, 2. The i = 1 operators contain the irreps
11]10, which both contribute to the matrix elements in general. So, the
[0]10 and [11

[111]10 contains [11

11]10 part (but not the [2

Wigner-Eckart theorem fails to provide an explanation for these i = 1 cases in (9a)
and (10a); although it works well with (9b) and (10b) where the scalar part [0]10 does
not contribute to the matrix elements. But in any case, it cannot explain why the
proportionality constants are the same for i = 0, 1 and 2.

The last relation (10c) is a little bit diﬀerent. Since [21]10 ×
11]10 and [2
−

[21]10 contain both
2]10, we do not have a simple relation as we had before. For i = 2,
[11
if we write equation (10c) as
e2i
e2i − h
, we can interpret
as two
h
independent sets of isoscalar factors; hence
can be written as a linear combinations
h
of the two sets of isoscalars. Once again, the argument does not apply to the i = 1 case;
and for i = 0, the three sets of matrix elements
are proportional to
each other as the operators are all U(10) scalars. Despite these diﬀerences between the
i = 0, 1 and 2 cases, they display the same relation as given in (10c). We will explain the
above relations in a more elegant way in the next few sections. Relations (9a) and (9b)
will be explained in section 3.3, and relations (10a) - (10c) in section 4.4 making use of
the isospin structure.

Before we go on any further, let us pause and reﬂect on what we have achieved
so far. We are trying to ﬁnd all the matrix elements of the nine operators ei, f i and
gi for the conﬁguration d2d′. The matrix elements
are rather well known, as they
come strictly from the d2 matrix elements (see Condon and Odabasi, 1980). Now with
equations (9a), (9b) and (10c), the gi matrix elements can be easily obtained from
those of f i and ei. Furthermore, with equations (10a) and (10b), the matrix elements
[111]10β
are readily obtained from the ei matrix

elements; we are only left with
to ﬁnd these matrix elements? By observation, we ﬁnd that the matrix elements of
ei + f i are surprisingly simple. For i = 0, the sum e0 + f 0 is always 3; for i = 1,
ei ≡
the sum e1 + f 1 is diagonal, and the value depends only on the U(5) and SO(5) irreps,
b
but not the U(10) label nor the spin and orbital ranks. For the case i = 2, the sum is
almost diagonal, with the three exceptions

The diagonal values once again do not depend on the U(10) irrep and the spin, although
they do depend on the orbital rank. These properties, which will be addressed in
section 5, greatly simplify our task of ﬁnding the f i matrix elements. With these
simple relations, (almost) all the matrix elements can be related to the known ei matrix
elements. We will elaborate this further in section 5.

3.3. The operators ei and

ei with simpler U(10) transformation properties

e

As mentioned before, the ten creation operators d†µ belong to the irrep [1]10 of U(10); so
do the ten components d′†µ . When we form products from the two independent sets, we
can get [2]10 or [11]10. From the knowledge of unitary groups and their representations,
we know that [2]10 corresponds to the symmetric product, while [11]10 the antisymmetric
one. More precisely, (d†µd′†ν + d′†µ d†ν) and (dµd′ν + d′µdν) have 45 components each; they

simultaneous interchange of d† with d′† and d with d′. But they are neither symmetric

we ﬁrst note that the annihilation operators within the parenthesis transform as the

similar expression with the creation operators grouped as a [11]10 product. This tells
us the new operators ei belong to [11

namely, we ignored the scalar parts. The arguments above do not exclude the possibility
that the operators can be U(10) scalars. As we already know, f 0 and g0 are both U(10)

From a group-theoretical point of view, it is more convenient to use these new
ei, with simpler transformation properties, rather than the distinct
operators, ei and
direct and exchange operators, f i and gi. Notice that the operators ei have the same
transformation properties as ei. The matrix elements of ei and
ei are given in table 5,
in which we copied down the ei matrix elements from table 2 to make it complete.
These new operators transform irreducibly in U(10), makes applying the Wigner-Eckart
theorem as well as the selection rules on the U(10) level so much easier and more elegant.

The above products are obtained using the method of Young’s tableaux. When
negative integers are involved in the IR, we ﬁrst add a constant to it so that all integers
becomes non-negative; then use the standard Young’s method to ﬁnd the Kronecker
product, and ﬁnally subtract the same constant from the resulting IR’s.
The Kronecker products are valid for large enough n. For instance, [111
contains at least six entries and is identically zero for U (5).

in the isospin space. This gives an elegant explanation to the simple relations observed in
the previous sections, as well as providing new results such as the closed-form expressions

lets us conveniently switch between conﬁgurations d3, d2d′ and so forth; hence CI can

[111]10 and [21]10. Another very important aspect about orthogonality is, operators with
diﬀerent transformation properties are necessarily orthogonal. For this reason, the i = 2

e2 is orthogonal to e2 and e2 as they have diﬀerent U(10)
SO(5) respectively. Similarly,
irreps. But ei and ei, as well as f i and gi, have the same transformation properties.
Can we ﬁnd a higher symmetry group to distinguish them? We also like to have a group
such that all the states in d2d′ belong to a single irrep.

4.2. The group U(20), its generators and its subgroup

The 100 generators of the group U(10) in terms of the creation and annihilation
operators are d†µdν + d′†µ d′ν. They can be re-expressed as (d†d)(SL) + (d′†d′)(SL), where
N ′
S = 0, 1 and L = 0,
among themselves. If we drop the scalar operators for which S = L = 0, we are left
with the SU(10) generators. The other subgroups that we use, SOS(3) and U(5), are
generated by (d†d)(10) + (d′†d′)(10) and (d†d)(0L) + (d′†d′)(0L) respectively.

One can however consider a more general transformation group. If we take the 20
one-electron states (d†µ or d′†µ acting on the vacuum
) as the basis vector space, the
most general transformation among them constitute the unitary group U(20), which has
400 generators of the form d†µdν, d′†µ d′ν, d′†µ dν and d†µd′ν. These operators preserve electron
number, but they connect states in diﬀerent conﬁgurations, like d2d′ with d3 and so
forth. The nine operators (ei, ei and

4.3. Isospin ranks for states and operators

2(N

−

Since fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons occupy the same
quantum state (spin and orbital quantum numbers ms, ml, and isospin z-component
mt, which is the same as principal quantum number n in a certain sense). Therefore,
any state with r electrons (d or d′) belongs to [1r]20 of U(20). Using the branching rule
given in table 3, [1r]20 →
, we can quickly write down the
isospin rank for all the states. Using the same notation as for regular spin, we put the
multiplicity [T ] = 2T + 1 as a superscript preceding the U(10) label. They are given in
table 1. Notice that the isospin ranks are uniquely determined by the U(10) labels for
atomic states. (This is not true for operators, however.) As for the isospin z-component
MT , it is simply given by the conﬁguration type. From equation (15), we can see that

Let us now look at the isospin rank of the Coulomb operators. The operators we
have considered so far, which do not include CI, all have MT = 0. This can be veriﬁed
by evaluating the commutator [T0, e0] = 0 for example (using equations (15) and (8a)).
From now on, we will omit the commutator brackets, knowing that the adjoint action
(group generators acting on operators) always means taking the commutator; and the
above equation reads T0e0 = 0. Since we know that all Coulomb operators belong
U(10) (from
to [11
table 3) will give us the possible ranks for the operators. The branching rules uniquely
determine the isospin rank of the operator
2]10. In fact, we
e1 are also isospin scalars as well. From equation (11),
can easily show that

For the other six operators ei and ei, the possible isospin ranks as given by the
branching rules are 1,5[0]10 and 1,3,5[11
11]10. The immediate question that comes to
mind is whether we can separate the various spin rank components from these operators.
Repeatedly applying the raising operator T+ to them should eliminate the lower rank
T 2
components. One of the results that we ﬁnd is T
+ei is proportional to T+ei. This
tells us that the operators ei do not have a rank 1 component. So, they belong only to
1,5[0]10 and 1,5[11

11]10. The results are summarized in table 4.

there is no spin 1 component, the remaining piece must be the isospin scalar part. From

Comparing this result to equation (17), we see that ei and ei are almost the same; after
all, they have the same group transformation properties. Of course, in the complete
analysis of conﬁgurations with at least two d′ and two d-electrons, one should include
three new operators of the kind d†d†dd
d′†d′†d′d′ to account for the interactions between
the two d′-electrons.

With our modiﬁed deﬁnition of e0, the right hand side of equation (18) becomes
8e0, and is a pure isospin rank 2 operator. Repeating the exercise, and keeping

track of the CG coeﬃcients carefully, one ﬁnds that this is true for any i. The

In principle, we can re-tabulate the matrix elements using these six new operators
ei that have simpler transformation properties in place of ei and
ei + ei and 2ei −
ei. However, we also feel that the relatively simple expressions of ei and ei (as in
equations (17) and (19)) have their merits. Moreover, the ei matrix elements are easily
obtained from the d2 matrix elements. We would rather leave them untouched. The
new combinations, with pure isospin ranks, can nevertheless give us a lot of useful
information and insight into the problem we are facing.

2 states cannot be stretched to T = 2. Therefore,

Recall that we have found some simple proportionality relations in equations (14a)–
(14c). The underlying reasons are as follows. The combination 2ei−
ei, with isospin rank
2, must have vanishing matrix elements if sandwiched between a pair of 2[21]10 states,
since two T = 1
for these
matrix elements, and thus we arrive at relation (14c). And the other combination ei +ei,
being an isospin scalar, must be diagonal in isospin space. So, it vanishes between a pair
of 4[111]10 and 2[21]10 states. In other words,
, as in equation (14b). From
our new perspective, the two Wigner-Eckart relations we had before are now interpreted
as selection rules on the isospin group.

To explain relation (14a) requires a more elaborate analysis. First notice that the
4[111]10 states also appear in the conﬁguration d3. In fact, they are almost the same
state, with the only diﬀerence in isospin z-component. Recall that states in d3 have

The ﬁrst one is of course relation (14a) that we are aiming at; the second one is a bonus,
that relates the d2d′ matrix elements to the ones in d3. Of course, the d3 matrix elements
are also available in the literature (see Nielson and Koster 1963 for instance), so the
second equation can be served as a consistency check.

4.5. Conﬁguration mixing via Coulomb interaction

The isospin arguments used above can relate the d3 Coulomb matrix elements to those in
d2d′. In the same way, we can obtain the mixed matrix elements between conﬁgurations
d3 and d2d′. The ﬁrst point to note is that the Coulomb operators which connect d3 with
d2d′ necessarily have MT = 1; so no isospin scalar Coulomb operator can be responsible
for CI. Let us write (

Before we close this section, we should mention the relevance of Brillouin’s theorem
(see Bauche and Klapisch 1972, and Godefroid et al 1987) in our analysis. The theorem
says, the Hartree-Fock (HF) solution ΨHF of the conﬁguration lN has vanishing matrix
elements with a class of states in lN
1l′. They are the states in which the l′ electron
1 state via the ordinary fractional parentage coeﬃcients (cfp) as
is coupled to the lN
1l′ and lN with the same angular form will not mix
in lN . That is to say, states in lN
via Coulomb interaction, if the HF solution for the lN conﬁguration is used.
In our
will have a vanishing radial integral. That
case,
i
does not make our work less useful, however. In order to apply Brillouin’s theorem in
our situation, one has to ﬁrst ﬁnd out the HF solution ΨHF for each single LS term
in the conﬁguration lN , which might be straightforward, but deﬁnitely not easy. Only
then, equation (24a) will rendered irrelevant, as Brillouin’s theorem predicts zero radial
integrals in those cases. All other results are otherwise unaﬀected.

e0 is an isospin
scalar, so is the combination e0 + e0. Their expressions from table 7 certainly verify that
fact; as T 2 is a scalar in SOT (3)
U(10); and the total electron number NT = N + N ′
is in fact a scalar in U(20) and hence scalar in all its subgroups.

Since the operators e2 + e2 and
e2 are both isospin scalars, clearly the sum must also
be diagonal in isospin space. With a little hindsight, we can further conclude that it is
diagonal in the U(5) space as well; so that the [21]5 states will not mix with [111]5 or
[3]5 states∗. The above three exceptions are the only possible oﬀ-diagonal entries we can
have. Furthermore, the matrix elements for a set of L states do not depend on the spin,
isospin or U(10) irreps; they depend only on their respective SO(5) irreps. All these
can be explained using the spin-isospin supermultiplet group SU(4) of Wigner (1937).

To explain these, let us ﬁrst introduce an alternative branching scheme U(20)

⊃
U(5) as oppose to the one in (16). The U ′(10)
SOS(3)
group acts on the isospin-orbital space, which is analogous but diﬀerent from the spin-
orbital U(10) group that we had before; however, the U(5) group is the same in both
schemes. To better display the symmetry, in the original scheme, we label a state with
its spin superscript [S] put before the U(5) label. For example, we now write the ﬁrst
2[21]5(21)F
of the doublet F states and the last of the quartet F states as
i
2[21]5(21)F
and
and
; which become
i
respectively in the new scheme. With a mere spin-isospin exchange, the doublet F
state switches with the quartet F state; on the other hand, the operator
e2 is invariant.
This explain why the two states have the same matrix element. But there is yet another
doublet F state,
, that has the same diagonal matrix element. To
accommodate this, we should promote the idea of spin-isospin exchange to a more
general transformation in the spin-isospin space. This leads us to introduce the SU(4)
supermultiplet group due to Wigner (1937). The three F states now fall into a single
U(20)♯. The other possible multiplets
U(5)
supermultiplet [21]4 ⊗
in d2d′ are [111]4 ⊗
e2, being a SU(4) scalar, is
∗ The operator is not a U (5) scalar however; U (5) scalars do not give (22) of SO(5).

aﬀect the validity of our arguments and results.

since each U(5) irrep is paired with a unique SU(4) irrep in the problem on hand. This

In other words, we only need to calculate the matrix element for one of the four terms
SGHI to determine the proportionality constant (which turns out to be unity). The

on the fully stretched state (2I) is reasonably easy. In the end, we ﬁnd that

is the only matrix element we need to calculate. All other d2d′ matrix elements are
related to ei ones via some simple arithmetic relations. This is a truly surprising result
from the present analysis.

6. Spin-Orbit interaction

From a group-theoretical point of view, the spin-orbit interaction is much simpler than
the Coulomb interaction. The interaction Hamiltonian, in second quantized form, is:

H2 = ζdd w(11)0

dd + ζd′d′ w(11)0
d′d′

where the ζdd and ζd′d′ are the corresponding radial integrals; the symbol κ following
the ranks (SL) for the coupled tensor w(SL)κ
(d†d)(SL)κ is the rank to which S and
L coupled (see Judd 1967). The radial integral ζdd is related to the classic parameter ζ
√15ζ. In the same manner, we can include
of Condon and Shortley (1953) by ζdd =
CI into our analysis by introducing the perturbing Hamiltonian

The operators w(11)0
are simply hermitian conjugate to each other. Each
1]20, the adjoint representation of U(20);
of the above four operators belongs to [1

since the nine components of w(11) are the SU(20) group generators (see section 4.2),
the coupled scalar operator must also belong to the adjoint representation. Using the
branching rule U(20)
1]10 +
1]10 can eventually give us a S = L = 1 (3P ) tensor in

U(10) scalar irreps can be dropped. Then from U(10)
1]10 gives

us 1,3[1
we only want the spin 1 part, so 3[1
1]5 is the only permissible label for the spin-orbit
operators on the SOS(3)

U(5) level.
Finally, on the SO(5) level, using the branching rules U(5)

1]5 gives
us (11) + (20) of SO(5), but (20) contains only S, D and G terms in SOL(3) while we
are looking for a P term. So, we can conclude that the spin orbit operators belong to
[1

6.1. Relations between various spin-orbit matrix elements on the U(10) level

Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, we can take advantage of the known spin-orbit
interaction matrix elements of the conﬁguration d3 (see Nielson and Koster 1963,
in which all the states belong to 4[111]10 of SOT (3)
U(10). Since
for instance),

[111]10 ×
write down several direct proportionalities. With the numerical constants, they run

Since these involve reduced matrix elements, no components of w(11) or magnetic
quantum numbers MS and ML appear; hence the extra information κ = 0 is rendered
irrelevant. So, with just three constants, we can determine all the spin-orbit matrix
elements between a pair of 4[111]10 states in d2d′, as well as the CI matrix elements
between d2d′ and d3.

For matrix elements involving the 2[21]10 states, there are no such corresponding
states in the d3 conﬁguration. But still, for matrix elements between the 4[111]10 and
2[21]10 states, since [111]10 ×
[21]10 contains the adjoint only once, we can relate the
reduced matrix elements by direct proportionalities, which turn out to be

Lastly, for matrix elements between a pair of 2[21]10 states, the simple version of the
Wigner-Eckart theorem does not apply, since [21]10 ×

twice. The above equations are all we can get from the Wigner-Eckart theorem on the
U(10) level. One direction to proceed is to seek for similar relations on the U(5) and
SO(5) levels, so that most of the remaining matrix elements can eventually be related
to the ones in d3. We can also look at the use of isospin in the spin-orbit analysis.

In order to take advantage of the underlying isospin structure in the spin-orbit

7. Concluding remarks

We started with this relatively simple conﬁguration d2d′ as the subject of the present
work. The ideas and techniques introduced in this paper can certainly be applied to
other conﬁgurations like dN d′ and dN d′
. Of course, it is a diﬀerent question whether
these conﬁgurations are experimentally observed, or simply of theoretical
interest.
Another obvious extension is to apply it to the f -shell electrons. The f -shell is known

N ′

Coulomb and spin-orbit interaction matrix elements in d2d′ conﬁguration

25

to have a richer group structure. We are aware that similar analysis on the f -shell might
reveal more surprises calling for explanations.

Another direction for further research is to introduce the idea of quasispin into
the analysis. Quasispin generators are of the type (d†d†)(00) and (dd)(00) in the case
of ordinary d-electrons. These operators, together with (d†d)(00) + (dd†)(00), generate
the SOQ(3) quasispin group. But in the case where the electrons have an extra
spin structure, namely the isospin, it is known that the analogous quasispin group
is qualitatively diﬀerent (see Flowers and Szpikowski 1964b, Feng and Judd 1982). The
full quasispin group is SO(8) rather than merely SO(3). This extra group structure
may gives us some new selection rules and proportionality relations, as we know it does
in the case of conﬁgurations of equivalent electrons.

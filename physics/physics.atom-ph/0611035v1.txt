polarizabilities: Applications to a few alkali atoms and alkaline earth ions

We present a general approach within the relativistic coupled-cluster theory framework to calculate
exactly the ﬁrst order wave functions due to any rank perturbation operators. Using this method,
we calculate the static dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities in some alkali atoms and alkaline earth-
metal ions. This may be a good test of the present theory for diﬀerent rank and parity interaction
operators. This shows a wide range of applications including precise calculations of both parity
and CP violating amplitudes due to rank zero and rank one weak interaction Hamiltonians. We
also give contributions from correlation eﬀects and discuss them in terms of lower order many-body
perturbation theory.

For a long time, studies of dipole and quadrupole po-
larizabilities have been highly interesting in many im-
portant aspects for both neutral atoms and ions [1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. These quantities are used in the
case of ions to remove the quadratic Stark shifts in the re-
cent proposed optical frequency standards where suitable
instruments are not available for very precise measure-
ments [12, 13]. Relativistic eﬀects are also investigated
for these properties [14, 15]. Often theoretical studies
are limited by many approximations to only approximate
accuracy of the results [17, 21]. In many cases, semiem-
pirical methods, which combine the calculated E1 and
E2 matrix elements of important states and the exper-
imental excitation energies, are used to calculate these
quantities [18, 19]. Core electron contributions are al-
ways only estimated in this approach [1, 18]. Therefore,
an ab initio method is necessary to be able to, in prin-
ciple, explain the importance of the electron correlation
eﬀects in the above properties and also test the many-
body theories employed. These results are largely used
to determine the van der Waals coeﬃcients or dispersion
factors [19, 20, 21, 22].
In some cases, the Dirac-Fock
(DF) method and relativistic random-phase approxima-
tions (RPA) for the Dalgarno-Lewis [21, 22, 23] or scalar
relativistic Douglas-Kroll [15, 16] eﬀective Hamiltonians
are used to determine these quantities. A number of cal-
culations on these quantities using molecular codes and
pseudopotentials have also been reported [9, 15, 16, 17].

Using the relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory, we
report here a novel approach for the ﬁrst time to calculate
wave functions up to all orders in the residual Coulomb
interaction and ﬁrst order due to any kind of perturbed
operator in one valence systems. This takes care of the
sum-over-states approach of the many-body perturbation

theory (MBPT) as an exact solution. This method can
be applied to calculate the ﬁrst order wave function due
to dipole and quadrupole transition operators. Hence,
polarizabilities can be obtained by calculating the expec-
tation values of the corresponding operators. As an ab
initio test of the theory, it is also possible to calculate the
light shift ratio in ions like Ba+ using the present method
as proposed in [24]. Moreover, parity non-conserving
(PNC) and CP violating amplitudes can be calculated
very precisely using this method due to rank zero or rank
one weakly interacting Hamiltonian, which are the most
challenging studies during the last three decades [25, 26].
To demonstrate the application of the method, we con-
sider three systems each from alkali atoms (Li, Na and
K) and alkaline earth ions (Be+, Mg+ and Ca+) to cal-
culate their dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities having
diﬀerent angular momentum selection rules.

The energy shift, ∆E(Jn, Mn) of any state |JnMn >,
with principal quantum number n, in a direct current
(dc) electric ﬁeld ~E = Eˆz can be expressed as

∆E(Jn, Mn) = −

where α1(Jn, Mn) is deﬁned as the static polarizability
of state |JnMn >. Further, α1(Jn, Mn) can be divided
as

z can be expressed in terms of the spherical harmonics of

coupled-cluster (CC) excitation operators, T excites only
the core electrons and Sn excites either only the valence

To get both the unperturbed and perturbed wave func-

where the exact wave function of the nth state can be
written in terms of the original atomic wave functions and
ﬁrst order corrections due to the corresponding dipole or
quadrupole operators O(= D or Q); i.e.

Note that the C angular factors from the α’s are absorbed
in the ﬁrst order wave functions.

We show that it is possible to calculate α(JnMn)’s
exactly by calculating both the |Ψ(0)
n i using
single many-body theory which can avoid the sum-over-
states approach given above. In our approach, we would
like to obtain the ﬁrst order perturbed wave function as

In the RCC theory, we express the exact wave function

for one valence (n) state of a system as

where T (0) and S(0)
are the CC operators for the DC
n
Hamiltonian and T (1) and S(1)
n are the corresponding ﬁrst
order excitation operators due to the interaction Hamil-
tonian. To calculate αi(JnMn), only linear terms involv-
ing T (1) or S(1)
n operators are kept from the exponential
function of Eqn. (0.10)

|Ψni = eT (0)

{1 + (1 + S(0)

n )T (1) + S(1)

Hence, the unperturbed and perturbed wave functions

can be separated as

|Ψ(1)

n i = eT (0)
n i = eT (0)

We consider only the single and double excitations
from the RCC method (CCSD method) in our calcula-
tions, which is proved successful to cope with the electron
correlation eﬀects in most one valence systems; i.e.

T = T1 + T2
Sn = S1n + S2n.

The above approach can easily be extended for a very
precise calculations of PNC amplitudes [25] and CP vi-
olating electric dipole moments (EDMs) in atoms [26]
by obtaining the ﬁrst order wavefunctions due to nuclear
spin independent and dependent weak interaction Hamil-
tonians in the place of dipole and quadrupole operators.

We construct the relativistic single particle orbitals us-
ing Gaussian type orbitals (GTOs) and we consider the
ﬁnite size of the nucleus assuming a Fermi charge distri-
bution as discussed in [27]. One can use length and veloc-
ity gauge expressions for E1 and E2 operators to verify

accuracy of the results. However, we have used only the
length gauge expressions which are more stable than oth-
ers in our calculations. We present our results in Tables
I and II, and compare them with the experimental re-
sults and other calculated values. Numerous calculations
are available for the dipole polarizabilities in the neutral
systems. However, we present only a few recent calcula-
tions in these tables. To our knowledge, there are only
a few experimental results for the dipole polarizabilities
whereas no results are found for the quadrupole polariz-
abilities, though there exist a number of calculations.

We present the DF and diﬀerent RCC results in Table
III to understand the role of electron correlation eﬀects.
As seen from this table, OS(1)
1n and its complex conju-
gate (cc) terms contribute predominantly. To interpret
these contributions, we break down this RCC term into
some of the leading order MBPT diagrams as shown in
the Fig. (1(a)). It is obvious from this relationship that
the above term consists of dominant DF (Fig.1(ai)), core-

polarization (Fig.1(aii) and 1(aiii)) and pair-correlation
(Fig.1(aiv)) eﬀects, therefore this results in large contri-
butions for all the systems. However, we also show in the
Fig. (1(b)) another important RCC term (OS(1)
2n ) as the
sum of diﬀerent types of core-polarization eﬀects. From
Table III, we ﬁnd that contributions from other higher or-
der terms are non-negligible while going towards the large
systems. We also notice from this table that the trend of
the correlation eﬀects in neutral and ionic systems with
the same electronic conﬁgurations are diﬀerent.

In conclusion, we have developed for the ﬁrst time a
general method in the relativistic coupled-cluster theory
to calculate the ﬁrst order wave functions due to any
rank operators for both the parities. This technique can
be applied to diverse areas of physics ranging from polar-
izabilities to probe physics beyond the Standard Model of

particle physics. We also investigated electron correlation
eﬀects from the dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities
calculations in six diﬀerent systems and highlight their
behavior. We observed that higher order correlation ef-
fects become important in large systems; suggesting that
the method can be employed rigorously in heavy systems
to obtain accurate results, and can be studied as ab initio
tests. Indeed, this approach can also be extended to de-
termine frequency dependent (dynamic) polarizabilities
which we defer to our next studies. Conclusively, the
many-body aspects presented here would certainly be of
interesting for both physicists and quantum chemists.

We are grateful to Professor B. P. Das for many useful
discussions and suggesting us to carry out this work. We
are also delighted to thank Professor P. Fulde for very
enlightening discussions and hospitalities at MPI-PKS.

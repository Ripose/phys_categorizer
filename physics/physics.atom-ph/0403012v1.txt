Abstract

In the ﬁrst Born approximation and using an elliptically polarized laser ﬁeld, the
Mott scattering of an electron by a Coulomb potential is investigated using the Dirac-
Volkov states to describe the incident and scattered electrons. The results obtained are
compared with the results of S.M. Li et al [1] for the case of a linearly polarized laser
ﬁeld and with the results of Y. Attaourti et al [2] for the case of a circular polarization.

1 Introduction

In this note, we give deﬁnite analytical results concerning the process of Mott scattering in

the presence of a strong laser ﬁeld and compare our results to previous theoretical works,
namely the work of S.M. Li et al [1] and the work of Y. Attaourti et al [2]. We hope this

contribution will be useful to all researchers working in this ﬁeld and will bring an end to
the controversy raised by the expression found by C. Szymanowski et al [3] for the case of

a circular polarization of the laser ﬁeld. An analytical expression for the spin-unpolarized

diﬀerential cross section is derived using trace calculations. The electric ﬁeld strength as

well as the frequency of the laser ﬁeld and the kinetic energy of the incoming electron being

key parameters, the study of the process of Mott scattering in the presence of an elliptically

polarized laser ﬁeld introduces a new key parameter, namely the degree of ellipticity η. The

cross section dependency on this new key parameter is reported. The general features of the

Mott scattering process are qualitatively modiﬁed when a laser ﬁeld is present and this is

particularly true when one study the spin-dependent relativistic Mott scattering. Not only it

is important to take care of the fact that the electron is a fermion but also to describe this

particle by the appropriate wave function in a non-perturbative way. This is done by using

the Dirac-Volkov wave functions [4] which contain the interaction of the electron with the

laser ﬁeld to all orders. The organization of this paper is as follows. In section II, we present

the theory in the ﬁrst Born approximation. In section III, we discuss the analytical results

for the spin-unpolarized diﬀerential cross section modiﬁed by the laser ﬁeld and analyze their

dependencies on the new relevant parameter, that is the degree of ellipticity η. We end by

a brief summary and conclusion in section IV. Throughout this work, we use atomic units
¯h = m = e = 1 and work with the metric tensor gµν = diag(1,

1).

2 Theory

We treat the laser ﬁeld classically since we are considering intensities that do not allow pair

creation [3]. The four potential corresponding to the laser ﬁeld satisﬁes the Lorentz condition
∂µAµ = 0 and is given by

A = a1 cos(φ) + a2 sin(φ) tan(η/2),

(1)

with φ = k.x = kµxµ = wt
k.x and where η is the degree of ellipticity of the laser ﬁeld. The
−
four vectors a1 and a2 satisfy the following relations a2
2 = a2 and the Lorentz condition
k.A implies a1.k = a2.k = 0. The linear polarization is obtained for η = 0 and the circular
polarization is obtained for η = π/2. The electric ﬁeld associated with the potential of the

1 = a2

laser ﬁeld is

The Dirac-Volkov wave functions ψqi(x) and ψqf (x) describe the incident and scattered electron
respectively. Such wave functions normalized to the volume V are [4]

where u(p, s) represents a Dirac bispinor normalized as u(p, s)u(p, s) = 2c2 and qµ = (Q/c, q)
is the quasi-impulsion acquired by the electron in the presence of the laser ﬁeld

The quantity R(q) is deﬁned by R(q) = 1+k/A//(2c(k.q)), and S(q, x) =

−
(a2.q) cos(φ) tan(η/2))/(c(k.q)), where the Feynmann slash notation is used [5] : for a given
four vector A, we have A/ = γµAµ. Finally the averaged squared potential A2 is given by

A2 = a2(1 + tan2(η/2))/2,

from which one deduces A2 = a2 for the case of a circular polarization of the laser ﬁeld and
A2 = a2/2 for the case of a linear polarization of the laser ﬁeld. The argument z of the
ordinary Bessel functions is

by the laser ﬁeld and its polarization does not play a key role. The physical explanation of

this observation is that classically, when the particles are close to the small angle scattering

region, this corresponds to large impact parameters and the incident electron does not deviate

notably from its trajectory. For other scattering angles, (45

to sum over a very large number of photons to recover the laser-free DCS. Furthermore, all

numerical simulations have shown the following. The DCS for linear polarization is always

higher than the two others. The DCS for elliptical polarization is lower or higher than the

DCS for circular polarization depending on the value of the degree of ellipticity η.

To have an idea about the behaviour of the DCS as a function of the degree of ellipticity

η, we have obtained a three dimensional curve corresponding to the same geometry as in Fig.

2 but for a degree of ellipticity η varying from 0 to π/2. There are oscillations of the DCS

for the elliptical polarization and the DCS for linear polarization is always the higher DCS.

These oscillations decrease as the number of photons exchanged is increased. The convergence

towards the laser-free DCS is faster for the linear polarization of the laser ﬁeld. For the circular

polarization, this convergence is easily obtained when one ﬁnds the value for the convergence

corresponding to the linear polarization whereas it is much more diﬃcult to infer from the

previous results for which value of the number of photons exchanged, the DCS for the elliptical

polarization will converge to the laser-free DCS. However, depending on the value of η and in

the non relativistic regime we have chosen, this number is

1250 photons. When the incident

±

9

electron relativistic parameter is increased from γ = 1.0053 to γ = (1

2 = 2, the previous

mentioned results remain valid but the corresponding DCSs are very small indicating a small

probability that the very fast projectile electron will exchange photons with the radiation

ﬁeld. As for the behaviour of the DCSs with respect to the degree of ellipticity, the ellipically

and circularly polarized laser modiﬁed cross sections become more sharply peaked around the

1

β2)−

−

angle θf = 0

. A similar result has been reported [3].

4 Conclusions

In this work, we have extended the study of the Mott scattering process of an electron by a

charged nucleus to the case of a general polarization. We have shown that the Mott-scattering

geometry as well as the key parameters such as the electric ﬁeld strength and the incident

electron kinetic energy inﬂuence the behaviour of the DCSs. Moreover, the degree of ellipticity

η is also a key parameter for the description of the Mott scattering process particularly in the

region of large momentum transfer and for a number of photons exchanged lower than that

for which the DCSs tend to the laser-free one.

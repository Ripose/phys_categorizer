Abstract. In this paper we review the diﬀerent relativistic and QED contributions to energies, ionic radii,
transition probabilities and Land´e g-factors in super-heavy elements, with the help of the MultiConﬁgura-
tion Dirac-Fock method (MCDF). The eﬀects of taking into account the Breit interaction to all orders by
including it in the self-consistent ﬁeld process are demonstrated. State of the art radiative corrections are
included in the calculation and discussed. We also study the non-relativistic limit of MCDF calculation
and ﬁnd that the non-relativistic oﬀset can be unexpectedly large.

1 Introduction

In the last decades, accelerator-based experiments at GSI
and Dubna have lead to the discovery of super-heavy ele-
ments up to Z = 116 and 118 [1] (for a recent review see
[2]). Considerable theoretical work has been done to pre-
dict the ground conﬁguration and the chemical properties
of those superheavy elements. Relativistic Hartree-Fock
has been used to predict the ground conﬁguration proper-
ties of superheavy elements up to Z = 184 in the early
70’s [3,4]. The Multiconﬁguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF)
method was used to predict orbital properties of elements
up to Z = 120 [5], electron binding energies up to Z = 118
[6,7], and K-shell and L-shell ionization potentials for the
superheavy elements with Z = 112, 114, 116, and 118
[8]. Ionization potential and radii of neutral and ionized
bohrium (Z = 107) and hassium (Z = 108) have been
evaluated with large scale MCDF calculations [9]. Kaldor
and coworkers have employed the relativistic coupled-cluster
method to predict ground state conﬁguration, ionization
potential, electron aﬃnity, binding energy of the negative
ion of several elements with Z ≥ 100 [10,11,12,13,14,15,
16,17].

Very recently, laser spectroscopy of several fermium
(Z = 100) transitions has been performed, the spectroscopy
of nobelium (Z = 102) is on the way [18,19,20], and
large scale MCDF calculations of transition energies and
rates have been performed by several authors for super-
heavy elements with Z = 100 [18,21], Z = 102 [21] and
Z = 103 [22], which are in reasonable agreement with the
fermium measurements.

There are however many unanswered questions, that
need to be addressed in order to assess the accuracy and
the limit of current theoretical methods. For inner-shells,
or highly ionized systems, QED eﬀects must be very strong
in superheavy elements, where the atomic number Z ap-
proaches the limit Zα → 1 (α = 1/137.036 is the ﬁne
structure constant), at which the point-nucleus Dirac equa-
tion eigen-energies become singular for all s1/2 and p1/2
− (Zα)2, where
states (the energy depends on
j is the total angular momentum). This mean that all
QED calculations must be performed for ﬁnite nuclei, and
to all orders in Zα. QED calculations for outer-shell are
very diﬃcult. At present, only the simplest one-electron,
one-loop diagrams can be calculated, using model poten-
tials to account for the presence of the other electrons.
The evaluation of many-body eﬀects, that remains large
for neutral and quasi-neutral systems, is also made very
diﬃcult by the complex structure of these atoms, in which
there may be several open shells. In that sense, meth-
ods based on Relativistic Many-Body Perturbation theory
(RMBPT) and MCDF methods are complementary. The
former one usually allowing for more accurate results, but
limited to (relativistic) closed shell systems minus one or
plus one or at most two electrons, while the latter is com-
pletely general but convergence becomes problematic for
large size conﬁguration set, particularly if one wants to
optimize all orbitals.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we present
brieﬂy the MCDF method, with emphasis on the speciﬁc
features of the code we have been using, and we described
the QED corrections that have been used in the calcu-

2

lations. In Sec. 3 we study speciﬁc problems associated
with the MCDF method (or more generally to all-order
methods). We thus study the non-relativistic limit of the
MCDF codes, and speciﬁc problems associated with high-
Z. In Sec. 3.2 we study a number of systems from highly-
charges ions to neutral atoms, for very large atomic num-
bers. The evaluation of atomic charge distribution size and
Land´e factors is performed in Sec. 5 and Sec. 6 is our
conclusion.

2 Calculation of atomic wavefunctions and
transition probabilities

2.1 The MCDF method

In this work, bound-states wavefunctions are calculated
using the 2006 version of the Dirac-Fock program of J.-P.
Desclaux and P. Indelicato, named mdfgme [23]. Details
on the Hamiltonian and the processes used to build the
wave-functions can be found elsewhere [24,25,26,27].

The total wavefunction is calculated with the help of
the variational principle. The total energy of the atomic
system is the eigenvalue of the equation

Hno pairΨΠ,J,M (. . . , ri, . . .) = EΠ,J,M ΨΠ,J,M (. . . , ri, . . .),
(1)
where Π is the parity, J is the total angular momentum
eigenvalue, and M is the eigenvalue of its projection on
the z axis Jz. Here,

Hno pair =

HD(ri) +

V(|ri − rj|),

where HD is the one electron Dirac operator and V is
an operator representing the electron-electron interaction
of order one in α. The expression of Vij in the Coulomb
gauge and in atomic units is

where rij = |ri − rj| is the inter-electronic distance, ωij is
the energy of the exchanged photon between the two elec-
trons, αi are the Dirac matrices and c is the speed of light.
We use the Coulomb gauge as it has been demonstrated
that it provides energies free from spurious contributions
at the ladder approximation level and must be used in
many-body atomic structure calculations [28,29].

The term (3a) represents the Coulomb interaction, the
term (3b) is the Gaunt (magnetic) interaction, and the last
two terms (3c) stand for the retardation operator. In this

expression the ∇ operators act only on rij and not on the
following wavefunctions.

By a series expansion of the operators in expressions (3b)

and (3c) in powers of ωij rij /c ≪ 1 one obtains the Breit
interaction, which includes the leading retardation contri-
bution of order 1/c2. The Breit interaction is, then, the
sum of the Gaunt interaction (3b) and the Breit retarda-
tion

In the many-body part of the calculation the electron-
electron interaction is described by the sum of the Coulomb
and the Breit interactions. Higher orders in 1/c, deriving
from the diﬀerence between Eqs. (3c) and (4) are treated
here only as a ﬁrst order perturbation. All calculations
are done for ﬁnite nuclei using a Fermi distribution with a
tickness parameter of 2.3 fm. The nuclear radii are taken
or evaluated using formulas from reference [30].

The MCDF method is deﬁned by the particular choice
of a trial function to solve equation (1) as a linear combi-
nation of conﬁguration state functions (CSF):

|ΨΠ ,J,M i =

cν |ν, Π , J, M i .

(5)

Xν=1

The CSF are also eigenfunctions of the parity Π , the total
angular momentum J 2 and its projection Jz. The label ν
stands for all other numbers (principal quantum number,
...) necessary to deﬁne unambiguously the CSF. The cν
are called the mixing coeﬃcients and are obtained by di-
agonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix coming from the
minimization of the energy in equation (1) with respect
to the cν. The CSF are antisymmetric products of one-
electron wavefunctions expressed as linear combination of
Slater determinants of Dirac 4-spinors

κ is a two-component spinor, and P and Q are
respectively the large and small component of the wave-
function.

A variational principle provides the integro-diﬀerential
equations to determine the radial wavefunctions and a
Hamiltonian matrix that provides the mixing coeﬃcients
cν by diagonalization. All the energies are calculated us-
ing the experimental nuclear charge distribution for the
nucleus taken from [30].

The mdfgme code provide the possibility to obtain
wavefunctions and mixing coeﬃcient with either only the

Coulomb (3a) interaction used to obtain the diﬀerential
equations and the Hamiltonian matrix that is diagonalized
to obtain mixing coeﬃcient or the full Breit operator (4).
The convergence process is based on the self-consistent
ﬁeld process (SCF). For a given set of conﬁgurations, ini-
tial wavefunctions, obtained for example, with a Thomas-
Fermi potential, are used to derive the Hamiltonian matrix
and set of mixing coeﬃcients. Then direct and exchange
potential are constructed for all orbitals, and the diﬀeren-
tial equations are solved. Then a new set of potential are
constructed and the whole process is repeated. Each time
the largest variation of all wavefunction has been reduced
by an order of magnitude, a new Hamiltonian matrix is
build and diagonalized, and a new cycle is done.

The so-called Optimized Levels (OL) method was used
to determine the wavefunction and energy for each state
involved. This allow for a full relaxation of the initial and
ﬁnal states and provide much better energies and wave-
functions. However, in this method, spin-orbitals in the
initial and ﬁnal states are not orthogonal, since they have
been optimized separately. The formalism to take in ac-
count the wavefunctions non-orthogonality in the transi-
tion probabilities calculation has been described by L¨owdin
[31] and Slater [32]. The matrix element of a one-electron
operator O between two determinants belonging to the
initial and ﬁnal states can be written

where the ψi belong to the initial state and the φi and
primes belong to the ﬁnal state. If ψ = |nκµi and φ =
|n′κ′µ′i are orthogonal, i.e., hnκµ|n′κ′µ′i = δn,n′δκ,κ′δµ,µ′ ,
the matrix element (8) reduces to one term hψi| O |φii
where i represents the only electron that does not have
the same spin-orbital in the initial and ﬁnal determinants.
Since O is a one-electron operator, only one spin-orbital
can change, otherwise the matrix element is zero. In con-
trast, when the orthogonality between initial and ﬁnal
states is not enforced, one gets [31,32]

where Dij′ is the minor determinant obtained by crossing

The mdfgme code take into account non-orthogonality
for all one-particle oﬀ-diagonal operators (hyperﬁne ma-
trix elements, transition rates. . . ). The overlap matrix is

build and stored, and minor determinants are constructed,
and calculated using standard LU decomposition.

2.2 Evaluation of QED corrections

In superheavy elements, the inﬂuence of radiative correc-
tions must be carefully studied. Obviously the status of
the inner orbital and of the outer ones is very diﬀerent. It
is not possible for the time being, to do a full QED treat-
ment. Here we use the one-electron self-energy obtained
using the method developed by Mohr [33,34]. These cal-
culations have been extended to the n = 2 shell [35,36]
then to the n = 3 to n = 5 shell, for |κ| ≤ 2 [37]. More
recently, a new coordinate-space renormalization method
has been developed by Indelicato and Mohr, that has al-
lowed substantial gains in accuracy and ease of extension
[38,39]. Of particular interest for the present work, is the
extension of these calculation to arbitrary κ values and
large principal quantum numbers [40]. All known value to
date have been implemented in the 2006 version of the md-
fgme code, including less accurate, inner shell ones , that
covers the superheavy elements [41,42]. The self-energy of
the 1s, 2s and 2p1/2 states is corrected for ﬁnite nuclear
size [43]. The self-energy screening is taken into account
here by the Welton method [44,45], which reproduces very
well other methods based on direct QED evaluation of
the one-electron self-energy diagram with screened poten-
tials [46,47,48]. Both methods however leave out reducible
and vertex contributions. However these two contributions
cancels out in the direct evaluation of the complete set of
one-loop screened self-energy diagram with one photon ex-
change [49]. The advantages of screening method, on the
other hand is that they go beyond one photon exchange,
which may be important for the outer shells of neutral
atoms. Recently special studies of outer-shell screening
have been performed for alkali-like elements, using the
multiple commutators method [50,51].

The comparison between the Welton model and the
[50,51] is presented in Table 1. This
results from Ref.
table conﬁrms comparison with earlier work at lower Z,
and shows that the use of a simple scaling incorporated in
GRASP 92 and earlier version of mdfgme, which use the
mean value of the radial coordinate over use hydrogenic
or Dirac-Fock wavefunctions, to derive an eﬀective atomic
number Zeﬀ by solving hr (Zeﬀ)ihydr. = hr (Zeﬀ )iDF. This
can be easily explained by noticing that the scale of QED
corrections is the electron Compton wavelength ΛC =
α a.u., while mean atomic orbital radii scale as n2

Z a.u.

When dealing with very heavy elements in the limit
Zα → 1, one should consider if perturbative QED is still
a valid model. Unfortunately, we still lack the tools to
answer this fundamental question. However, the use of
numerical all-order methods may gives some partial an-
swers. In particular they allow to include the leading con-
tribution to vacuum polarization to all orders by adding
the Uehling potential [53] to the MCDF diﬀerential equa-
tions. This possibility has been implemented in the md-
fgme code as described in [54], with the help of Ref.
[55].
It also allows to calculate the eﬀect of vacuum polarization

in quantities other than energies, like hyperﬁne structure
shifts [54], Land´e g-factors [56], or transition rates. It can
also provides some hints on the oder of magnitude of QED
eﬀects on atomic wavefunction, orbital or atom radii, and
electronic densities.

For high-Z, higher order QED corrections are also im-
portant. In the last decade, calculations have provided the
complete set of values for two-loops, one-electron diagrams
to all orders in Zα [57,58,59,60,61] and also low-Z ex-
pansions. All available data has been implemented in the
mdfgme code. However, this data is limited to the n ≤ 2
shells.

3 Limitation of the MCDF method

3.1 Non-relativistic limit

It may sound rather paradoxical to investigate the non-
relativistic limit of MCDF (and more generally) all-order
calculations, when studying superheavy elements. It was
found many years ago, in systems like the ﬂuorine isoelec-
tronic sequence [62], that the non-relativistic limit, ob-
tained by doing c → ∞ in a MCDF code, was not properly
recovered: states with LSJ label 2S+1LJ and identical L
and S, and diﬀerent J, which should have had the same
energy in the non relativistic limit did not. This lead to
incorrect ﬁne structure in cases when a relativistic con-
ﬁguration has several non relativistic parents (i.e., several
states with one electron less, and diﬀerent angular struc-
ture, that can recouple to give the same conﬁguration).

More recently, this non-relativistic problem was shown
to be general to any all-order methods, in which sub-
classes of many-body diagrams are re-summed, without
including all the diagrams relevant of a given order. In
the MCDF method, in particular, one should add all con-
ﬁgurations with single excitations of the kind nκ → n′κ,
that in principle, should have no eﬀect on the energy in
a non-relativistic calculation, due to Brillouin’s theorem
[63]. In the iso-electronic sequence investigated up to now,
this eﬀects became less severe when going to higher Z.

In neutral, or quasi-neutral superheavy elements, the
outer-shell structure can be complex, with several open
shells, and thus many possible parents core conﬁgurations.
It is then worthwhile to study if this problem could arise.
We have then studied a number of cases. As a ﬁrst example
we have studied neutral uranium. The ground state con-
ﬁguration is known to be [Rn]5f 36d7s2 5L6. We have cal-
culated all levels of the ground conﬁguration with J = 0 to
9, both in normal conditions, and taking the speed of light
to inﬁnity in the code. The results are shown on Fig. 1.
There are two group of levels that can be aﬀected by a NR
oﬀset: the 5f 36d7s2 5HJ , J = 4, 5 and the 5f 36d7s2 5LJ ,
J = 6, to 9. The non-relativistic (NR) oﬀset is evalu-
ated for both groups of levels as the diﬀerence between
the energy of a given conﬁguration and the one for the
conﬁguration with the lower energy in the NR limit. The
ﬁgure clearly show a NR oﬀset of 25 meV for the 5H4 and
5H5, and one of less than 1 meV for the four 5LJ levels.
While it can be signiﬁcant compared to the accuracy of
a laser measurement, it is probably negligible compared
to the accuracy of realistic correlation calculations. the
largest ever observed. This problem is thus very severe,
and would lead to completely wrong values for the ﬁne
structure. In order to assess the generality of this prob-
lem, we have investigated several other systems. Element
125 is the ﬁrst element with a populated 5g orbital [3,4].
We have calculated the NR oﬀset for a conﬁguration with
125 electrons [Rn]5f 146d107s27p68s25g6f 4, for Z = 125,
135 and 140. The results are presented on Fig. 2. We ﬁnd
three groups of levels with LSJ labels, four levels with
label 6FJ (J = 1/2 to 7/2), three levels with label 6KJ
(J = 9/2 to 13/2) and four levels with label 6NJ (J=15/2
to 21/2). The NR oﬀset in each group is of the order of a
few meV, while the (non-relativistic) energy diﬀerence be-
tween the two ﬁrst groups is 0.19 eV, and between the ﬁrst
and the last groups 0.25 eV. The ﬁgure also shows that
the NR oﬀset gets smaller when Z increases as expected.

We have also investigated the lower excited states of
a somewhat simpler system, element 118 (eka-radon). We
have explored the [Rn]5f 146d107s27p58s which should ex-
hibit no NR oﬀset (it has single parent states) and [Rn]-
5f 146d107s27p57d. The results are presented on Fig. 3. As
expected, the 7p58s 3PJ states do not exhibit an NR oﬀset,
within our numerical accuracy. The 7p57d 3LJ conﬁgura-
tions however do have a strong NR oﬀset, up to 0.8 eV,
much larger than we expected from the other results pre-
sented above. Clearly, such a large oﬀset would render any
calculation of the ﬁne structure useless, unless the NR oﬀ-
set is corrected for.

Subtracting the NR oﬀset is only a partial ﬁx, since it
[63] that not only the ﬁne structure
was shown in Ref.
is aﬀected, but also the level energy. The only possible
solution is thus to do calculations with a large number of
conﬁgurations, including all single excitations. In view of
the complexity of calculations on the superheavy elements,
and of the extra convergence diﬃculties associated with
the presence of Brillouin excitations, this is not a very
appealing perspective.

3.2 Eﬀect of the all-order Breit operator on simple
systems

The use of diﬀerent form of the electron-electron interac-
tion in the self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF) process has a pro-
found qualitative inﬂuence on the behavior of variational
calculations that goes beyond changes in energy. In par-
ticular the mixing coeﬃcients between conﬁgurations con-
tributing to intermediate coupling are strongly aﬀected.
For example, let us examine the very simple case of the
1s2p 3P1 state in two-electron system. In a MCDF calcula-
tion, intermediate coupling is taken care of by calculating
| 1s2p 3P1i = c1 | 1s2p1/2J = 1i + c2 | 1s2p3/2J = 1i. The
evolution as a function of the atomic number Z of the c2
coeﬃcient, is plotted on Fig. 4, with only the Coulomb in-
teraction, or the full Breit interaction made self-consistent.

Fig. 3. Non-relativistic oﬀset on the lower excited conﬁgura-
tions of eka-radon (Z=118).

The ﬁgure shows clearly that the inclusion of the Breit in-
teraction in the SCF process lead to values of c2 that are
one order of magnitude lower at high-Z that when only
the Coulomb interaction is included. It means that the JJ
coupling limit is reached much faster. This has some in-
ﬂuence even in the convergence of the calculation: as the
exchange potential for the 2p3/2 orbital is proportional

2

c1
c2 (cid:17)

(cid:16)

, it becomes very large, and the calculation does
to
not converge. This can be traced back to a negative en-
ergy continuum problem. If we use the method described
in Ref.
[26] to solve for the 2p3/2, then convergence can
be reached, provided the projection operator that suppress
coupling between positive and negative energy solution of
the Dirac equation is used. On Fig. 5, the diﬀerent contri-
butions to the 1s2p 3P1 level energy are plotted at Z = 40.
The minimum, which corresponds to the level energy, is
obtained for a mixing coeﬃcient (habitually obtained by
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix), c2 = 0.104.
The shape of the magnetic and retardation energy con-
tribution, as observed on the ﬁgure, shows clearly that
the curve used to ﬁnd the minimum (which represents the
sum of the contribution of the mean values of the opera-
tors in Eqs. (3a), Eqs. (3b), and (4)) is shifted to the left
compared to the pure Coulomb contribution. This explain
why the mixing coeﬃcients gets much smaller when using
the Breit interaction in place of the Coulomb interaction
in the SCF process. At high-Z this lead to an extra diﬃ-
culty to achieve convergence: as can be seen in Figs. 6 and
7, the minimum corresponding to the 1s2p 3P1 state (the
one lower in energy) is very close to c2 = 0. It thus some-
times happens during the convergence, that c2 changes
sign, leading to very tedious tuning of the convergence pro-
cess. This is even worse for the 1s2p 1P1 state, because one
is trying to reach the maximum energy. In that case the
oscillation of the c1 coeﬃcient around zero are impossible
to damp. Obviously, such problems will slowly disappear
when going to neutral systems. For example, in neutral
nobelium (Z = 102) c2 changes only from 0.47250012 to
0.47316712.

4 Relativistic and QED eﬀects on transition
energies and probabilities

4.1 Beryllium isoectronic sequence correlation

As one would expect the stronger eﬀects that could hap-
pen when Zα → 1, it is interesting to investigate a simple
many-body system. In that sense the beryllium isoelec-
tronic sequence is an interesting model case, as it exhibit
a very strong intrashell coupling between the 1s22s2J = 0
and 1s22p2
1/2J = 0 conﬁgurations, which are almost de-
generate in energy. We thus calculated all contributions to
the energy, with and without including the vacuum polar-
ization and Breit interaction in the SCF process. From this
we could deduce the loop-after-loop Uehling contribution
to the total energy, and the intrashell correlation. Most
quantities contributing to the total energy do not exhibit
any speciﬁc behavior when Zα → 1. However, a major
changes in behavior of the system occurs around Z = 125
as shown in Fig. 8. One can see that the ground state,

which is 1s22s2J = 0 at lower Z, becomes 1s22p2
1/2J = 0.
This can be seen on the mixing coeﬃcients as plotted on
Fig. 8. This translates into a strong increase in the loop-
after-loop vacuum polarization contribution. Obviously, if
we were able to evaluate other second-order QED calcula-
tion than loop-after-loop vacuum polarization, including
oﬀ-diagonal two-electron self-energy matrix elements for
quasi-degenerate state, following recent work on helium-
like systems [64,65,66], there could be more unexpected
eﬀects to observe.

While not displaying such a feature, the total corre-
lation energy increases strongly, reaching up to 3.6 keV.
One can observe eﬀects on other properties of the atom,
like orbital energies and mean orbital radius. Figure 9
shows that, in the same atomic number range when the
ground state changes of structure, the 2p3/2 orbital radius
and energy exhibit a very strong change. The behavior of
the ground state must be connected to the fact that the
small component of 2p1/2 orbitals, as can be seen from
(7), has a s behavior, and the ratio between small
Eq.

and large component is of order Zα. It is thus under-
standable that such eﬀects could occurs when Zα → 1. It
should be noted that this eﬀects happens even with a pure
Coulomb electron-electron interaction, which is one more
proof it is only connected with the behavior of the one-
electron wavefunctions. We investigated the similar case
of the magnesiumlike sequence, which exhibit strong in-
trashell coupling between the 3s, 3p and 3d orbitals, but
we could not observe any eﬀect on energies in this range
of Z. However the [Ne]3p2
1/2 mixing coeﬃcient started to
increase faster around Z = 128, but convergence problems
prohibited us to investigate higher Z.

4.2 Relativistic correlations on the neon isoelectronic
sequence

Calculating completely correlated energies can be performed
only on relatively small systems. Neonlike ions, with 10
electrons are a small enough system that can be calcu-
lated with rather large basis sets. We have extended the

from Z = 95 to Z = 134, the highest Z for which con-

function of nℓ does not change with increasing Z.

4.3 Transition energies and probabilities in nobelium
and element 118 (eka-radon)

In this section we study the diﬀerent contributions to the
energy and transition probabilities of nobelium (Z = 102)
and eka-radon (Z = 118). Nobelium is the next candidate
for measurement of its ﬁrst excited levels transition en-
ergy by laser spectroscopy. Large scale calculations have
been performed recently [21]. Here we examine a num-

even though many of them have not been calculated from
n > 2, should remain completely negligible, since they
will be of the same order of magnitude as the Loop-after-
loop and K¨all`en and Sabry contributions. The self-energy
screening is almost exactly compensating the self-energy,
but leaves a contribution that should be visible if one can
calculate correlation well enough. At the present level of
accuracy, calculation of the pure Coulomb correlation is
the real challenge as it requires considerable eﬀort on the
size of conﬁguration space.

The transition probabilities on Table 5 have been eval-
uated with diﬀerent approximation, using theoretical en-
ergies. Here the choice of the wavefunction optimization
technique has a sizeable eﬀect. It remains small compared
to correlation, but still at the level of 0.2%. We also inves-
tigated the eﬀect of using fully relaxed orbitals on both
initial and ﬁnal state. In particular we checked at the
Dirac-Fock level of approximation, what is the order of
magnitude of taking into account non-orthogonality be-
tween initial and ﬁnal state orbitals. We found 2.2% for
the 3P1 → 1S0 transition, 0.014% for the 1P1 → 1S0
transition and -0.025% for the 3P2 → 1S0. For calcula-
tions between correlated wavefunctions, it is anyway im-
portant to evaluate the matrix elements for oﬀ-diagonal
operators, taking account non-orthogonalities between ini-
tial and ﬁnal state orbitals, as it can change dramatically
the contribution of a given CSF, since overlaps between
correlations orbitals in initial and ﬁnal states can be very
diﬀerent from either one or zero.

As another example we have also calculated several
transition energies and rates for element 118, which are
displayed in Table 6. For the most intense 7p57d → 7s27p6
transitions and for the 7p58s → 7s27p6 transitions we did
a MCDF calculation, taking into account all single and
double excitations, (except the ones corresponding to the
Brillouin theorem) from the 7s and 7p shells to the 7d and
6f shells for the 7p6 1S0 ground state (38 jj conﬁgurations)
and for the 7p57d excited states (657 jj conﬁgurations),

into account all single and double excitations, except the
one corresponding to the Brillouin theorem, from the 5f
and 7s shells to the 7p, and 6d shells (48 jj conﬁgura-
tions). For the excited states we included excitations from
5f , 7s and 7p shells to the 7p and 6d ones. This leads to
671 jj conﬁgurations for the 7s7p 3P1 and 7s7p 1P1 states
and 981 for 7s7p 3P2. The results of this calculation are
presented on Table 3 for the total energies of the levels,
on Table 4 for the transition energies and on Table 5 for
transition probabilities. It is clear from the two ﬁrst tables
that many contributions that are important for level en-
ergies are completely negligible for transition probabilities
in this case. This is not true for highly charged ions, even
at much lower Z. In particular two-loop QED corrections,

and from the 7p and 8s shells to the 7d and 6f shells for
the 7p58s excited states (151 jj conﬁgurations).

The transition energy was calculated for some of these
transitions, with and without including the vacuum polar-
ization and Breit interaction in the SCF process, and we
concluded that the transition energy is not signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by the inclusion of these interactions in the SCF.
This is illustrated on Fig. 11 that shows the transition
energy values for 7p57d 3P1 transition.

5 Relativistic and QED eﬀects on Land´e
factors, atomic radii and electronic densities

Although transition energies and probabilities, as well as
ionization potential are important quantities, it is interest-
ing to study relativistic and QED eﬀects on other atomic
parameters, like Land´e g-factors, atomic radii and elec-
tronic densities. Land´e factors, which deﬁne the strength
of the coupling of an atom to a magnetic ﬁeld, can help
characterize a level.

In some experiments concerning superheavy elements,
singly ionized atoms are drifted in a gas cell, under the in-
ﬂuence of an electric ﬁeld. The drift speed can be related,
in ﬁrst approximation, to the charge distribution radius of
the ion [68,69]. In this context, it can also be interesting
to look at the atomic density, and see how it is aﬀected
by relativistic and QED eﬀects. In that case, though, we
can only get a feeling of this eﬀect by comparing den-
sities calculated with and without the Breit interaction
self-consistent, or with and without the Uehling potential
included in the diﬀerential equation. At presents, there is
no formalism that would enable to account for changes in
the wavefunction related to the self-energy.

ical radius (“smr”) and the mean radius of the outermost or-

(NB: the dip in the curve correspond to sign changes of the
correction).

Charge distribution can be described in a number of
ways, and the deﬁnition of atomic or ionic radius has
evolved over the years. Slater noticed a long time ago
the correlation between the value of the maximum charge

density of the outermost core electron shell and the ionic
radius of an atom [70]. Such a deﬁnition, however does not
provide a way to take into account mixing of outer shell in
MCDF calculations. Other authors have chosen either the
mean radius of a speciﬁc orbital hrn,l,j i [71] or weighted
mean radius [72]. Results have been obtained for bohrium
and hassium. It is not at all obvious either than what is
true in crystals must be valid for singly charged ions drift-
ing in a gas. Here we have evaluated four diﬀerent quan-
tities and their dependence in the Breit interaction and
vacuum polarization. We have evaluated the position of
the maximum density of the outermost orbital, the mean
radius of the outermost orbital hrn,l,ji, the atom mean ra-
dius, and the atom mean spherical radius. The two ﬁrst
quantities have been tested in detail, but they cannot rep-
resent the ionic radius when one has a complex outer shell
structure or when one calculate correlation. The mean ra-

dius of the atom is represented as

for p = 1 and the mean spherical radius is obtained as

hr(2)

at. i. Both can be calculated in a MCDF model, as the
q
̟i contain both the occupation numbers and the mixing
coeﬃcients. As an example we have plotted the contribu-
tion to hr(p)
at. i to Sg+ on Fig. 13 of individual values of
̟ihr(p)
i for the diﬀerent orbitals. Contrary to the in-
dividual orbitals quantities or to the average performed
[9], both quantities
only on the outer shell, like in Ref.
have sizeable contributions from several outer shells. The
7s, 6p, 5f and 6d contribute signiﬁcantly to both the mean

and the mean spherical atomic radius, but the contribu-
tion of the 6d orbitals is more dominant for the mean
spherical radius. The results for singly charged ions with
57 ≤ Z ≤ 71 and 90 ≤ Z ≤ 108 are presented on Table 7
and plotted on Fig. 14. The comparison between mean ra-
dius and mean spherical radius with the Breit interaction
in the SCF process with Coulomb values, shows changes
around 0.04% to 0.08% depending on the atomic number.
Self-consistent vacuum polarization has an eﬀect 2 to 4
times smaller, depending on the element. We emphasize
the fact that we used the for the ion the conﬁguration
corresponding to the ground state of a Dirac-Fock calcu-
lation, as given in [6]. For a few elements, the physical
ground state, as given for example on the NIST database,
is diﬀerent.

We have used the deﬁnition above to evaluate the eﬀect
of correlation on the ion radii. The calculation has been
performed on neutral nobelium (Z = 102). The results are
presented on Table 8. One can see that the radius of max-
imum density follows exactly the trend of the mean radius
of the outer orbital. however the atomic mean radius and
mean spherical radius follow a diﬀerent trend.

There has been two experiments measuring drift time
of singly ionized transuranic elements in gases. One mea-
sured the relative velocity of Am+ with respect to Pu+
[68] and one which measured the same quantity for Cf+
and Fm+. The results of these experiments is expressed
as

∆rA

The experiments above provide ∆rAm+
Pu+ =-3.1 ± 1.3%
and ∆rFm+
Cf + =-2% respectively, which shows a shrink-
age of Am as compares to Pu and of Fm as compared
to Cf. The comparison between these experiments and
the calculation of singly charged ion radii from Table 7 is
shown in Table 9. Although it is diﬃcult to draw any ﬁrm

−

q

at. i repro-
conclusion from so few data, it seems that
duces best the experiment, followed by hr(1)
at. i. We want to
point out that the < r7s > values for neutral atom, from
Ref.
[5], or ours, which are in good agreement gives a
-1.5% change for Am/Pu and -3.0% for Fm/Cf, compare
well with experiment. The 7s radius of the singly charged
ions, as shown in Table 7, increases when going from Am
to Pu, thus leading to a ratio of the wrong sign, while the
5f average radius, or the global atomic radii as deﬁned
here all show the right trend. The change of behavior for
Am, is due to the relative diminution of the l(l + 1)/r2
barrier compared to the Coulomb potential as a function
of Z. The 5f radius reduces then strongly, leading to the
change of the structure of the ground conﬁguration, and
to the change of the radius of the 7s orbital.

QED corrections on Land´e factors of one and three
electron atoms have been studied in great details in the
last few years, because of the increase in experimental
accuracy associated with the use of Penning traps in a
new series of experiments [73,74]. These experiments pro-
vided a strong incentives to evaluate very accurately QED
corrections on Land´e factors, beyond the one due to the
anomalous magnetic moment of the electron [75,76,77,

78,79,80,81,82]. To our knowledge, there has been only
one calculation dealing with QED corrections in heavy
elements, in which the Feynman diagrams correspond-
ing to self-energy and other corrections were evaluated.
This calculation concerned alkali elements up to francium
(Z = 87) [83]. Here we deal with much more complex
system, with several open shells, and we calculate QED
corrections due to the inclusion of the Breit interaction
and of the vacuum polarization in the SCF, as well as the
contribution from the electron anomalous moment. The
coupling of an atom with a magnetic moment µ to a ho-
mogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B gives an energy change

As an example, we illustrate the diﬀerent eﬀects by
evaluating the Land´e g-factors for the ground conﬁgura-
tion of neutral actinide and transactinide up to Z = 106,
and of singly ionized lanthanide, actinide and transac-
tinide up to Z = 106. The results are displayed on Table
10 for neutral atoms and on Table 11, for singly ionized
atoms. The ground conﬁguration of neutral atom comes

from [85]. For singly ionized atoms, it has been taken from
Refs. [6] for Z up to 106 and from [9] for Z = 107 and 108.
Depending on the outer shell structures, the QED correc-
tions can be dominated by either the g − 2 correction or
the Breit correction (order of 0.1% of the Land´e factor).
The Vacuum polarization correction is at best one order
of magnitude smaller at Z = 106.

In Table 12, we present correlation eﬀects on the Land´e
g-factor of the lowest levels of No, evaluated with the same
wavefunctions as in Sec. 4.3, with the Breit operator in
the SCF process. The eﬀect of correlation ranges from
0.6% to 0.02% depending on the level.

6 Conclusions

In this work we have evaluated the eﬀects of self-consistent
Breit interaction and vacuum polarization on level ener-
gies, transition energies and probabilities Land´e g-factors
on super-heavy elements. We have also studied their ef-
fect on orbitals and atomic charge distribution radii and
found very large eﬀects on highly charged ions. We have
found some hints, when studying Be-like ions, of rather
strong non-perturbative correlation eﬀects for Z ≈ 128.
For neutral or quasi-neutral systems, self-consistent Breit
interaction and vacuum polarization have a small but no-
ticeable eﬀects on Land´e factor and transition rates, which
could be felt experimentally. Transition energies, on the
other hand are heavily dominated by Coulomb correla-
tion. This is rather good news, since treating the Breit
interaction self-consistently obliges to evaluate during the
SCF process magnetic and retardation integrals, which
are about one order of magnitude more numerous than
Coulomb ones, leading to calculations that cannot ﬁt on
even on the largest computers available today, even with
relatively small conﬁguration space.

We have shown that very large non-relativistic oﬀset
aﬀect the ﬁne structure separation of elements with several
open shells. This should be carefully taken into account to
avoid providing completely wrong results with all-order
methods. We have also shown that the inclusion of the
Breit interaction in the SCF process, because it get mixing
coeﬃcients closer to the jj limit, can noticeably complicate
numerical convergence.

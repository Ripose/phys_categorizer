We show that for a general system of N s-wave point scatterers, there are always N eigenmodes.
These eigenmodes or eigenchannels play the same role as spherical harmonic partial waves for a
spherically symmetric target—they give a phase shift only. In other words, the T matrix of the
system is of rank N and the eigenmodes are eigenvectors corresponding to non-0 eigenvalues of the
T matrix. The eigenmode expansion approach can give insight to the total scattering cross section;
the position, width, and superradiance or subradiance nature of resonance peaks; the unsymmetric
Fano lineshape of sharp proximity resonance peaks based on the high energy tail of a broad band;
and other properties.

INTRODUCTION

II. BASIC CONCEPTS IN QUANTUM
SCATTERING

Scattering of waves from a group of scatterers is rich
in interesting physical phenomena. Examples are elec-
trons or phonons scattering from defects or impurities in
crystals and light scattering from conjugated molecules
or biological complexes.

p

Multiple scattering eﬀects are nontrivial, especially
when scatterers are placed close, i.e., inside each other’s
σ/π, where σ is the total cross sec-
eﬀective radius
tion of a single scatterer. If the scatterers are resonant,
their eﬀective radius can be much larger than their the
physical size or force range. A classical example is the
case of weak, ﬁxed frequency sound incident on two proxi-
mate, small identical air bubbles in water [1, 2, 3]. Quan-
tum mechanically, for two scatterers placed together well
within the resonant wave length of scattered particle, ex-
tremely narrow proximity resonance can appear [4, 5].
Three or more proximate scatterers lead to related ef-
fects.

In this paper we have formulated a novel general
method, eigenmode expasion, for quantum scattering of a
system of s-wave point scatterers of any number and geo-
metric conﬁguration, and applied it to resonant and non-
resonant scattering from such systems. The eigenmode
expansion approach is equivalent to solving Lippmann-
Schwinger equation exactly—taking all orders of multiple
scattering into account, yet it provides many new physi-
cal insights.

Our formulation for a general non-symmetric system
of s-wave scatterers turns out to be directly analogous
to the usual formulation for spherically symmetric po-
tentials. For this reason, and to establish notation, we
begin by brieﬂy reviewing some standard results in quan-
tum scattering theory [10].

Consider an elastic scatterer placed at ~r = 0. The
asymptotic form of the total wave function can be written
as:

ψ~k(~r) ∼= ei~k

~r + f (~k, ˆr)
·

eikr
r

for r → ∞.

(1)

The ﬁrst term on the RHS is the incoming plane wave,
and the second term is the scattered wave. At distance r
large compared to the size of the scatterer, the scattered
wave is an outward spherical wave with some angular de-
pendent scattering amplitude f (~k, ˆr), which must satisfy
the optical theorem:

4π
k

Imf (~k, ˆr = ˆk) = σ(~k),

(2)

where the total cross section

σ(~k) ≡

|f (~k, ˆr)|2 dˆr.

ZZ

The T matrix of the scatterer in the subspace of energy
shell |~k| = k, Tk, can be deﬁned as an operator acting on
functions of ˆr:

Tky(ˆr) ≡

f (kˆr′, ˆr)y(ˆr′) dˆr′.

If the scatterer is spherically symmetric, it is meaning-
ful to rewrite the incoming wave as a sum of spherical

Each term in Eq. (4) is a solution to free space
Schr¨odinger equation (without the scatterer). We can
also expand f (~k, ˆr) (which is a function of k and ˆk · ˆr
only) into Ylm(ˆr)’s:

f (~k, ˆr) =

4πfl(k)Y ∗lm(ˆk)Ylm(ˆr),

Each term in Eq. (6) is a solution to Schr¨odinger equa-

part Ylm(ˆr)eikr/r for space with and without the scat-
terer is the factor of 1 + 2ifl(k)k, which should be uni-
modular since there is no absorption or emission involved.
Thus we deﬁne

−

1 + 2ifl(k)k ≡ ei2δl(k), or fl(k) =

sin δl(k)eiδl(k),

k

where δl(k) is the phase angle and is real. Ylm(ˆr)’s are
actually eigenvectors of Tk with eigenvalues kfl(k) =
sin δl(k)eiδl(k):

TkYlm(ˆr) = sin δl(k)eiδl(k)Ylm(ˆr).

(7)

Therefore, in Ylm(ˆr) basis, Tk has a diagonal form:

Tk = diag{sin δ0(k)eiδ0(k), · · · , sin δl(k)eiδl(k)

(repeat 2l + 1 times), · · ·}.

consistent with the optical theorem. The total cross sec-
tion is a sum of contributions from each partial wave.

We restrict ourselves to scatterers whose force range is
small compared to the wavelength of the scattered parti-
cle so that it only scatters the s-wave component j0(kr):
f (~k, ˆr) ≡ f (k) = f0(k). There is only one non-0 phase
angle δ(k) = δ0(k) left and Tk is reduced to a rank-1
matrix:

Tk = diag{sin δ(k)eiδ(k), 0, · · ·}.

(9)

Note that |f (k)| is of order
as the eﬀective radius.

where the “scattered wave” can exist without the in-
coming wave. Physically E0 and Γ0 correspond to po-
sition and width of the resonance peak respectively. In
phase shift picture, the phase angle monotonically in-
creases from 0 to π as the energy goes from 0 to ∞.
The position of the peak corresponds to the maximum
possible value of sin2 δ, i.e., at δ = π/2, and the width
is determined by how fast δ passes through π/2 and
nearby region as a function of energy (dashed lines in
Fig. 1). Eq. (10) is slightly distorted from the more fa-
miliar form: f (k) = − 1

III. SCATTERING OF MULTIPLE POINT
SCATTERERS [6]

We assume the force range of the scatterer is small
compared to the wavelength of incoming wave, so that it
can be considered as existing only at one point. In this
point scatterer model, Eq. (1) holds not only asymtoti-
cally, but over all space:

ψ~k(~r) = ei~k

~r + f (k)Gk(r),
·

(11)

where the free space Green function Gk(r) = eikr/r.
Since any incoming wave φ(~r) of energy E = k2/2 can
be written as a superposition of plane waves ei~k
~r with
·
|~k| = k, the total wave function can be written as:

ψ(~r) = φ(~r) + φ(0)f (k)Gk(r).

(12)

The only signiﬁcant diﬀerence to Eq. (11) is the extra
factor φ(0), the amplitude of the incoming wave at the
point scatterer. From now on, we mean “s-wave point
scatterer(s)” when we use the word “scatterer(s)” unless
otherwise noted.

The total wave function for a system of N scatterers

ﬁxed at positions ~r1, ~r2, · · ·, ~rN is:

ψ(~r) = φ(~r) +

ψi(~ri)fiGi(~r),

(13)

N

Xi=1

where fi is the scattering amplitude of the i-th scatterer,
Gi(~r) is the free space Green function from ~ri:

Gi(~r) =

~ri

eik
~r
|
−
|
|~r − ~ri|

,

and for simplicity we have omitted all implicit k (energy)
dependence in equations. The φ(0) in Eq. (12) is replaced
by the amplitude at the i-th scatterer of the i-th eﬀec-
tive incoming wave ψi(~r)—the sum of the incoming wave
and waves scattered by all scatterers except by the i-th
scatterer itself:

ψi(~r) = φ(~r) +

ψj( ~rj )fjGj(~r).

(14)

Xj
=i

We know the total wave function everywhere once we
know ψi(~ri). Eq. (14) provides a system of linear equa-
tions for ψi(~ri). We can express them explicitly in matrix
form. Deﬁne vector for incoming wave ~φ and vector for
eﬀective incoming waves ~ψ as:

φi ≡ φ(~ri), ψi ≡ ψi(~ri) (i = 1, · · · , N ).

Deﬁne the N ×N free space Green matrix G as:

Gij ≡

(cid:26)

Gj (~ri) for i 6= j,
for i = j,
0

and matrix F as:

F ≡ diag{f1, f2, · · · , fN }.

Substitute ~r with ~ri in Eq. (14), we get

~φ = M ~ψ, or ~ψ = M−

1~φ,

(15)

where

M ≡ 1 − GF.

The physical implication of Eq. (15) is clear. Formally

M−

1 = 1 + GF + (GF)2 + · · · ,

3

each term (GF)l (l = 0, 1, · · ·) means the incoming wave
is scattered l times, since F means scattering once by one
scatterer, and G means free propagation from one scat-
terer to another. An integral equation similar to Eq. (15)
is known in general scattering theory as the Lippmann-
Schwinger equation [7]. A trivial case is when the scat-
terers are far apart: |~rj − ~ri|≫|fi|, so multiple scattering
1, so ~ψ ≈ ~φ,
eﬀects do not exist: GF ≈ 0. M ≈ 1 ≈ M−
the eﬀective incoming waves are just the incoming wave.
The scattered wave is just a sum of the scattered waves
from each scatterer as if other scatterers were not present.
The scattered wave φsc(~r) depends only on ~φ, the am-
plitudes of the incoming wave at scatterers. Resonances
1(E) on complex E plane, or at sin-
occur at poles of M−
gular points of M(E), where the “scattered wave” can
exist without the incoming wave. Positions and widths
of resonance peaks are related to real and imaginary parts
1(E) as mentioned in section II. The scat-
of poles of M−
tered wave is a sum of the scattered waves from each
scatterer hit by an eﬀective incoming wave. Asymptoti-

If the incoming wave is a plane wave ei~k

parenthesis of Eq. (16) is nothing else but the angular

tain the total cross section from f (~k, ˆr).

IV. FORMULATION OF EIGENMODE
EXPANSION

Is there any incoming wave for multiple scatterers such
that, for the same inward part of the wave function, the
only diﬀerence in outward part for space with and with-
out the scatters is a phase factor, just as spherical har-
monic partial waves for a spherically symmetric target?
This is equivalent to looking for eigenvectors of the T ma-
trix (or the S matrix, S = 1 + 2iT ) of the whole system.
In the spherically symmetric potential case, diagonaliza-
tion of S matrix is essentially spherical harmonic partial
wave expansion. Some textbooks have discussed the for-
mal diagonalization of the S matrix for a general system,
and its application to scattering of particles with spin
and scattering reactions [11]. We have found, as will be
shown immediately, that for a system of s-wave point
scatterers of any number and geometric conﬁguration,
the T matrix can be analytically represented under some
special basis, and can be diagonalized easily.

For a single scatterer, for incoming partial wave j0(kr)
(= (G(r) − G∗(r))/2ik), the scattered wave is propor-
From
tional to G(r)—the outward part of j0(kr).

4

Eq. (14), we see the scattered wave of multiple scatterers
for any incoming wave is a superposition of Gi(~r)’s, so
we try to write the incoming wave as a superposition of
j0(k|~r − ~ri|)’s:

the “eigen-phase angle” or simply phase angle of eigen-
mode j:

ei2∆j ≡ 1 + 2iλj, or λj = sin ∆jei∆j .

(22)

Compare Eq. (18) and (22), we see for the same inward
ikr/r of the wave function, the only diﬀer-
part y′j(ˆr)e−
ence in the outward part yj(ˆr)eikr/r for space with and
without the scatterers is the phase factor of 1 + 2iλj,
which should be unimodular. Each ~qj or yj(ˆr) can be
regarded as an eigenmode of the system, qij being the
relative amplitude of the scattered wave from the i-th
scatterer (Eq. (20)). We can deﬁne a real variable ∆j as

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

λj’s lie on the unitary circle—the circle of radius 1/2 and
centered at i/2—on complex plane.

Eigenmodes have some basic properties (see ap-
pendix A for proof of these properties). (1) ~qj can always
be chosen real due to time reversal symmetry:

q∗ij = qij.

(24)

(2) The eigenmodes obey orthonormal relations upon
normalization:

~qi

T J ~qj =

1
4π

δij , or

y∗i (ˆr)yj(ˆr) dˆr = δij .

(25)

ZZ

(3) λj’s and yj(ˆr)’s are actually eigenvalues and eigen-
vectors of the T matrix:

T yj(ˆr) = sin ∆jei∆j yj(ˆr).

(26)

It is clear now that the eigenmodes yj(ˆr) here have the
same role as spherical harmonics Ylm(ˆr) in spherically
symmetric case (compare Eq. (25) and the orthonormal
relations of spherical harmonics, and compare Eq. (26)
and (7)). Spherical harmonics are eigenmodes under spe-
cial conditions, namely, when the system is spherically
symmetric.

Any incoming wave can be written as: φ(~r) =
N
i=1 cij0(k|~r − ~ri|) + φ′(~r), where φ′(~r) is orthogonal
to each j0(k|~r − ~ri|). Immediately we see the φ′(~r) part
P
does not scatter at all, because each scatterer only scat-
ters s-wave and φ′(~r) is orthogonal to each j0(k|~r−~ri|), an
s-wave centered at ~ri. For a single scatterer, the T matrix
is of rank 1 (Eq. (9)). For a system of N scatterers, if the
scatterers are far apart so that j0(k|~r −~ri|)’s do not over-
lap, the T matrix of the system has N degenerate non-0
eigenvalues sin δeiδ, so it is of rank N . If the scatterers
are not far apart so multiple scattering eﬀects exist, the
rank of the T matrix is still N , since the system only
scatters incoming waves belonging to the N -dimensional
function space the sum in Eq. (17) span.

There is a simpler explanation for the rank of the T ma-
trix. Recall from section III that the scattered wave
φsc(~r) depends only on ~φ, amplitudes of the incoming
wave at scatterers (Eq. (13) and (15)). For all the in-
ﬁnitely degenerate incoming waves of energy E = k2/2,
we can have a basis in which all but N waves have 0 am-
plitude at all ~ri’s. Consequently, the system only scat-
ters the N waves which have non-0 amplitudes at ~ri’s,
and does not scatter the rest at all. This is related to
the previous paragraph because for any incoming wave
φ(~r) with energy k2/2 and orthogonal to j0(k|~r − ~ri|), we
must have φ(~ri) = 0—0 amplitude at the i-th scatterer.
In eigenmodes yj(ˆr) (plus all other linearly indepen-
dent functions of ˆr orthogonal to all yj(ˆr)’s) basis, the
T matrix has a diagonal form:

T = diag{sin ∆1ei∆1, · · · , sin ∆N ei∆N , 0, · · ·}.

V. APPLICATIONS OF EIGENMODE
EXPANSION TO PROXIMITY RESONANCE

(Compare with Eq. (9).) The eigenmodes are actually
eigenvectors corresponding to non-0 eigenvalues of the
T matrix. In fact, matrix T is representation of T ma-
trix in the (nonorthogonal) bj(ˆr) ≡ 1

where we have used the orthonormal relations of yj(ˆr)
Eq. (25). The optical theorem is also satisﬁed (ap-
pendix B), as it should be. The total scattering cross
section not only depends on the energy (or k), but also
the direction of the incoming wave ˆk, since aj depends
on ˆk. This is what we would expect for a system without
spherical symmetry. The average of total cross section
over all possible incoming directions for a given energy,
=k σ(~k) dˆk, on the other hand, is a property of the
1
4π
system only, independent of ˆk [12]. From now on, we
mean the average of σ(~k) over all possible ˆk’s, denoted
as σ, whenever we use the word “total cross section”.
The average of |aj|2 over all possible ˆk is just 4π (ap-
pendix B), so the total cross section

contribute a resonance peak to total cross section (if the
peaks do not overlap). The position of the peak is at
where ∆j = π/2, and the width is determined by how
fast ∆j passes through π/2 and nearby region as a func-
tion of energy. For a system of N scatterers, there will be
N resonance peaks in total cross section, whose positions
1(E)
and widths are consistent with the N poles of M−
on complex E plane.

First we consider the simplest case of multiple scatter-
ing: two identical scatterers separated by distance d. It
is easy to verify that F, M, and J all have the form of
1J. Thus without know-

, so does TJ = kFM−

(cid:18)
ing f (k) explicitly, we can immediately say the two (un-
normalized) eigenmodes are:

and ~q2 =

(cid:18)

(31)

corresponding to the two scatterers oscillating perfectly
in and out of phase with the same strength, respectively.
Eq. (31) is valid at any energy. Fig. 1 shows an example
of the total cross section and phase angles as a function
of energy. For kd < 1, i.e., the scatterers are placed
within each other’s eﬀective radius, the “s-like” symmet-
ric ~q1 mode becomes a broad band, and the “p-like” anti-
symmetric ~q2 mode becomes a sharp proximity resonance
peak, both shifted from the peak of single scatterer, as
In the limit of d → 0, ~q1 mode
shown in Fig. 1a [4].
rigorously becomes an s-wave and ~q2 mode a p-wave.

The three scatterer case turns out to have a richer phe-
nomenology. We consider three identical scatterers po-
sitioned on a straight line separated by equal distance:
~r1 = (−d, 0, 0), ~r2 = (0, 0, 0), ~r3 = (d, 0, 0). Compared
to the two scatterer case, the diﬀerence is that the rel-
ative amplitudes in each ~qj are now energy dependent.
Nonetheless, upon reﬂection about yz plane, there are al-
ways two symmetric modes ~q1, ~q3, and one antisymmetric
mode ~q2. Fig. 2c shows the phase angles as a function
of energy. They determine the positions and widths of
the peaks in total cross section (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b shows
the contributions of each eigenmode to the total cross
section in Fig. 2a. The eigenmodes at ~q1 mode’s peak
(E = 6.735) are:

The total cross section is a sum of contributions from
each eigenmode, perfectly analogous to Eq. (8)!

Numerical evidence shows that for scatterers with the
properties of Eq. (10), each eigen-phase angle ∆j mono-
tonically increases from 0 to π as the energy goes from 0
to ∞. Or equivalently, each λj starts from 0 and rotates
counterclockwise on the unitary circle and back to 0 as
energy goes from 0 to ∞. Therefore each eigenmode will

We see that ~q1 is s-like, ~q2 p-like, and ~q3 d-like. Indeed
numerical evidence shows that at low energies (E < E0)
~q1, ~q2, and ~q3 converge to s-, p-, and d-waves when d → 0.
The ~q1 mode gives most of the broad band and the other
two modes give two sharp proximity resonance peaks.

FIG. 1: Solid lines: (a) total cross section σ and (b) phase an-
gles ∆j of each eigenmode as a function of energy of a system
of two identical scatterers separated by distance d = 0.25/k0.
The scattering amplitude of each scatterer is speciﬁed by
Eq. (10), with E0 = k2
0/2 = 10 and Γ0 = 1. For comparison,
the total cross section and phase angle of a single scatterer
are also shown (dashed lines).

If we disregard the continuity of ∆j(E), it is deter-
mined up to an integral multiple of π. For reasons
that will become clear in a moment, we redraw Fig. 2c
in Fig. 2d with restriction −π/2 < ∆j ≤ π/2. At
E ∼ 12.28, ∆1 and ∆3 undergo an avoided crossing: in-
stead of one going sharply from some −α to π − α and
the other remaining at 0, ∆1 goes sharply from −α to
0− and ∆3 goes sharply from 0+ to π − α. This is really
an avoided crossing of eigenvalues λ1 and λ3 at λ ≈ 0 of
matrix TJ as a function of E. Tracking ~q1 and ~q3 around
the avoided crossing region, we ﬁnd ~q1 is s-like and ~q3 is
d-like before the crossing (E < 12.28), yet ~q1 becomes d-
like and ~q3 becomes s-like after the crossing (E > 12.28).
In contrast, ∆2 rigorously crosses ∆1 and ∆3, since it has
a diﬀerent symmetry. Indeed if we remove the symmetry
of the system, there is always avoided crossing whenever
two phase angles tend to cross at 0 (Fig. 3b). The ~q3
mode peak exhibits a Fano lineshape (Fig. 2a) [8]. The
dip around E ∼ 12.28 before the peak comes from the
avoided crossing at 0. Sin2∆ will exhibit a Fano line-
shape if ∆ goes from some −α to π − α, with minimum
at ∆ = 0 and the peak still at ∆ = π/2. Therefore, there

is always a dip when two phase angles tend to cross at 0.
The deepness of the dip depends on how narrowly they
avoid crossing.

Numerical evidence shows that for a general system of
N identical scatterers conﬁned well within each other’s
eﬀective radius, there is always a broad band with res-
onance energy < E0 and some sharp proximity reso-
nance peaks on the high energy tail of the broad band
(Fig. 4) [6]. The broad band corresponds to a mode (say,
~q1) where all scatterers oscillate in phase, i.e., all qi1’s
have the same sign, so there is no node in y1(ˆr). In this
sense this is an s-like mode. The s-like mode corresponds
to the superradiant state in scattering of one photon by
a collection of atoms [9]. Qualitatively the peak is broad
because the scatterers oscillate in phase and waves scat-
tered from each scatterer add up constructively, causing
this mode to decay much faster than single scatterer. The
remaining N − 1 modes give N − 1 sharp proximity res-
onance peaks. They correspond to weak, long lifetime
subradiant states. The scattered waves of these modes
are weak because at their respective peaks they have little
s-wave component and waves scattered from each scat-
terer tend to add up destructively. ~q1 mode is s-like at
low energies. As a consequence of avoided crossing of
phase angles, the s-like character will shift to diﬀerent
eigenmodes at diﬀerent energies.

It is somewhat surprising to ﬁnd numerically that, even
for a typical nonsymmetric system, at low energies yj(ˆr)’s
are very much like linear combinations of Ylm(ˆr)’s of same
l, i.e., they almost have well deﬁned angular momenta l’s.
yj(ˆr)’s also have lowest l’s possible at low energies, so
they are still s-, p-, d-, · · · like. By lowest possible l’s, we
mean that if all scatterers are on a line, there will be 1 s-
like, 1 p-like, 1 d-like, · · ·, mode, bacause each eigenmode
must have rotational symmety with respect to the line
of scatterers; if all scatters are on a plane, there will
be 1 s-like, 2 p-like, 3 d-like, · · ·, modes, because each
eigenmode must have reﬂection symmetry with respect
to the plane of scatterers; if the scatters are distributed
in 3D space, there will be 1 s-like, 3 p-like, 5 d-like, · · ·,
modes. At higher energies, the eigenmodes have mixed l’s
in avoided crossing region, yet the mixing is still mostly
within lowest possible l’s. yj(ˆr)’s always have very little
component of l’s higher than necessary.

For a general nonsymmetric system, if the sharp prox-
imity resonance peaks are well separated, each sharp
peak corresponds to a trend of a sharp increase of a phase
angle by π based on the “broad band trend line”. We can
get the broad band trend line on phase angles vs. energy
graph by ﬁrst identifying the segments of each phase an-
gle where its corresponding eigenmode is s-like, and then
connecting them smoothly over the avoided crossing and
sharp peak regions (Fig. 2d and 3b). Each sharp peak
corresponds to a trend of a phase angle to sharply in-
crease from some −α (0 < α < π/2) on the broad band
of s-like mode to π − α—back onto the broad band, with
avoided crossing at 0. In total cross section vs. energy
picture, each proximity resonance peak exhibits an un-

if the phase angles do not come close enough in avoided
crossing, but in principle each sharp proximity resonance
peak is always unsymmetric (Fig. 2a ( ~q3 peak only), 3a

VI. SUMMARY

We have shown that for a system of N s-wave point
scatterers, we can always ﬁnd N eigenmodes, for which
the only diﬀerence in the outward part with and without
the scatterers is just a phase factor. The T matrix of the
system is of rank N . The eigenmodes are eigenvectors
corresponding to non-0 eigenvalues of the T matrix and
are orthogonal to each other. The total scattering cross
section is a sum of contributions from each eigenmode.
The position and width of resonance peaks are deter-
mined by where the eigen-phase angle ∆ (determined up
to an integral multiple of π) equals π/2 and how fast ∆
passes through π/2 and nearby region as a function of
energy.

Each phase angle monotonically increases from 0 to π
as energy goes from 0 to ∞ if each scatterer has one Breit-
Wigner type resonance. If identical scatterers are placed
well within each other’s eﬀective radius, the eigenmodes
are always s-, p-, d-, · · · like with lowest possible angular
momenta l’s except for the regions where phase angles
have avoided crossings. Within avoided crossing regions,
the eigenmodes have components of diﬀerent l’s mixed,
yet the mixing is still almost within lowest possible l’s.

There is always one broad band arising from an s-
like mode, whose peak is shifted to energy lower than
the peak of single scatter resonance, and N − 1 sharp
proximity resonance peaks on the high energy tail of the
broad band. The broad band peak correspond to super-
radiant state in scattering of light, and the sharp peaks
correspond to subradiant states. The unsymmetric Fano
lineshape of sharp peaks based on the high energy tail
of the broad band background originates from the trend
of a phase angle sharply increases from some −α on the
broad band to π − α (back onto the broad band) with
avoided crossing at 0.

In the future, we will investigate the generalization of
eigenmode expansion in scattering to groups of multi-

dependence of the sprectrum (total cross section as a
function of energy or wavelength) on the spatial distribu-
tion of scatterers, and statistical properties of the spectra
of collections of a large number of randomly distributed
scatterers. We need to extend the theory to non-identical
scatterers, and to multiphoton emission of collections of
atoms (i.e. true superradiance).

is also a valid total wave function. Compare Eq. (A1)
and (A2), we know both ~qj and ~qj ∗ are eigenvectors of
TJ corresponding to the same eigenvalue sin ∆jei∆j , so
~qj can be chosen real.

Note in Eq. (A2) we have assumed k is real, so it is
not applicable to complex E, especially at the poles of
M−

Abstract We investigate nonresonant contributions to Rayleigh
scattering cross sections in atomic transitions. The problem-
atic nonresonant contributions set a limit to the accuracy to
which atomic spectra determine energy levels. Speciﬁcally, we
show that oﬀ-resonant contributions for the 1S–2S two-photon
transition in atomic hydrogen are negligible at current and pro-
jected levels of experimental accuracy. The possibility of a dif-
ferential measurement for the detection of oﬀ-resonant eﬀects
in one-photon transitions in atomic hydrogen is discussed.

Introduction

Recently, the dramatic progress in the laser-spectroscopic experiments in atomic hydrogen [1]
has sparked interest in theoretical calculations at highly improved accuracy [2–5]. This raises
interesting questions regarding the relation of the resonance peak in the scattering cross section,
which is observed in experiments, and the actual diﬀerence in the – real parts – of the energies
of the two levels involved in the atomic transition 1. In short, one may ask to which level of
accuracy atomic spectra determine energy levels. Related questions are of prime importance for
the determination of fundamental constants [6].

These issues are mostly easily dealt with if one assumes that the scattering process is de-
scribed to a good approximation by a Kramers–Heisenberg [7] formula. For one-photon tran-
sitions, the excitation of the atom from the ground state by a laser photon and subsequent
spontaneous emission 2 is well described by the two diagrams in Fig. 1. For two-photon tran-
sitions, the situation is more involved. We consider here a process where two interactions with
laser-photons are followed by two spontaneous emissions (see Fig. 2).

It has been pointed out as early as 1952 [9], that the experimental spectrum of atomic hydro-
gen does not reproduce the energy level diﬀerences precisely, and that nonresonant contributions
to Rayleigh scattering shift the observed resonance peaks relative to the energy level diﬀerences
by a frequency δω which is of the order of

α2 (Zα)6 mc2
~ ,

∝

(1)

where m is the electron mass, α is the ﬁne structure constant, Z the nuclear charge number,
and c the speed of light; ~ = h/(2π) is the natural unit of action where h denotes Planck’s
constant. This shift δω occurs for one-photon transitions where the atom returns to its ground
state after the spontaneous emission. Later, the interesting fact that resonance peaks do not
necessarily determine atomic energy levels was discussed in [10]. Nonresonant contributions
have also been discussed by a number of experimemtalists, e.g. [11]. We also refer to the related
investigations [12–17]. In a recent theoretical calculation of higher-order radiative eﬀects for
hydrogenic P states [18], it had also been pointed out that an accurate analysis of the line shape
becomes necessary at the level of the current theoretical uncertainty.

A priori, the detection of a nonresonant contribution of the form (1) in a one-photon tran-
sition would require the determination of the peak of a hydrogenic transition frequency with
a relative accuracy of roughly 10−7 [the natural radiative decay rate of a typical bound state
in atomic hydrogen is of the order of α (Zα)4 in units of m c2/h]. In Sec. 3, we will devise a
diﬀerential experiment by which the nonresonant contribution could be observed more clearly.
This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2, we estimate nonresonant frequency shifts in
both one- and two-photon transitions with special attention devoted to the 1S–2S two-photon
transition in hydrogen (our estimates are also of relevance for other two-photon processes). In
Sec. 3, we consider a diﬀerential experiment in which nonresonant eﬀects could be observed in a
measurement of optical transition frequencies in atomic hydrogen. Conclusions are left to Sec 4.

1the “imaginary part” of the energy −i Γ/2 corresponds to the “radiative width” of the state which is related

to the “radiative lifetime” τ according to 1/τ = Γ/~

2This process, which constitutes an elastic scattering process – the atom returns to the ground state –, is known
as Rayleigh scattering. Inelastic scattering of highly energetic photons by free electrons (or by “approximately
free” electrons) is known as Compton scattering, and inelastic scattering in the low-frequency domain is known
as Raman scattering (see e.g. the discussion on pp. 314–316 of [8])

The ﬁrst theoretical description of atomic two-photon transitions was given in [19], with the ﬁrst
experimental observation following in [20]. The description becomes less involved if one assumes
that both the initial and the ﬁnal state of the transition are “asymptotic states”, i.e. states which
can be used as initial and ﬁnal states for S-matrix elements. This is a valid approximation only
in the case of a long radiative lifetime for both the initial and the ﬁnal state of the transition.
In the “asymptotic-state” approximation, the diﬀerential cross section [see Eq. (7.43) of [21]]
to be the ground state) through

This problematic Doppler-broadened background can be suppressed by appropriately chosen
experimental conditions: in current experiments [1], the resonance conditions require that two
laser photons from two counter-propagating beams (these are eﬀectively σ+ and σ− polarized),
are absorbed by the atom, resulting in a mutual cancellation of ﬁrst-order Doppler-shifts and a
suppression of the Doppler-broadened background.

As is evident from Eq. (2), for two-photon transitions, we can expect large nonresonant
eﬀects if the light of one of the lasers is close to an intermediate resonance (~ωL ≈
E1).
In this case, the energy denominator in (2) becomes resonant – we would then even have to

an “intermediate-state” resonance occurs only if there exists an intermediate state with the
appropriate energy.

For the current high-precision hydrogen measurements [1], the situation is diﬀerent. Here, two
counter-propagating laser photons from opposite spatial directions, but with the same frequency,
drive a two-photon transition. This eliminates at the same time the ﬁrst-order Doppler eﬀect

For such a Doppler-free two-photon transition, all energy denominators in the summation
in (2) remain oﬀ-resonant even at the peak of the two-photon resonance which is near ωL ≈
E1)/(2~). A possible exception would be formed by an atomic system in which there is
(Ef −
– accidentally – an intermediate state present with an energy “half-way” between E1 and Ef ,

hydrogen spectrum is not “equally spaced”.

An inspection of the cross-section (2) accounts for the fact that the Doppler-free two-photon
1S–2S resonance is extremely narrow with a natural line width of Γf = Γ2S. We recall that the
natural width of the 2S level in atomic hydrogen is 1.3 Hz [22].

How could nonresonant contributions be estimated in an improved framework which avoids
the “asymptotic-state” approximation inherent to Eq. (2)? As a “warm-up exercise”, we ﬁrst
consider a two-photon process with one photon being absorbed and one being emitted (see
Fig. 1). The atom is being excited from its ground state
by
interaction with a laser of frequency ωL and returns to the ground state
via spontaneous
emission. The cross section is proportional to [7, 9]

In this case, the energies of the two emitted photons ωs and ωt are subject to the condition
ωs + ωt = 2ωL. An integration over one of the energies is required; this has no inﬂuence on our
considerations below. In this context, it is problably worthwhile to note that similar calculations
involving four-photon processes have to be performed in the context of third-harmonic genera-
tion, see Eq. (9-77) of [8]. Terms left out in the expression (13), denoted by “. . . ”, correspond to
the diﬀerent time-orderings of spontaneous emissions and interactions with the laser [cf. Eq. (2)].

We can now use exactly the same formalism as were used in the analysis of the two-photon
cross section (3). A calculation based on the Eqs. (4) – (12) shows that the nonresonant con-
tributions to the four-photon process described by Eq. (13) result in a shift of the peak of the

We will now consider the 1S–2S two-photon transition in atomic hydrogen. The imaginary
part of the energy (“the width”) of the 2S state is given – to within a good approximation – by
the two-photon radiative lifetime which is of the order of [22]

(15)

(16)

Γ2S ∝

α2 (Zα)6 .

δω2L ∝

α4 (Zα)10 .

This order-of-magnitude estimate can also be inferred by considering the poles and corresponding
residues of the low-energy part of the two-photon self-energy, as expressed in nonrelativistic
quantum electrodynamics [the relevant formula is given in Eq. (16) of [23]]. In view of Eqs. (14)
and (15),

This is a factor of α2 (Zα)4 smaller than the width of the 2S state. For the 1S–2S transition in
atomic hydrogen, this estimate means that the oﬀ-resonant contributions will enter at the level
of 10−14 Hz. This is far smaller than the natural width of the 2S state and irrelevant for current
measurements which have an accuracy of about 46 Hz [1].

In many cases, the shift of the peak of a resonance by oﬀ-resonant contributions is much
smaller than the natural width of the resonance itself. This is not surprising and can be un-
derstood qualitatively. A careful inspection of the physics associated with Eq. (10) is suﬃcient.
The derivative of the narrow resonance contribution fres(x) near x = 0 changes rapidly in the
vicinity of the resonance; by contrast, the oﬀ-resonant contribution foﬀ(x) is rather ﬂat in that
frequency region. The shifted resonance frequency must fulﬁll the condition that the sum of the
derivatives of resonant and oﬀ-resonant contributions must add up to zero. The derivative of
the resonant contribution changes rapidly – even within its natural width – and compensates
that of the oﬀ-resonant contribution in the vicinity of the original resonant contribution. This
implies that the shifted peak of the resonance must lie very close to its original value and can
only be shifted by a frequency diﬀerence which is much smaller than the natural width of the
initial and ﬁnal states in the resonance transition.

The nonresonant shift is evaluated here by employing the condition (10), which is valid for
the maximum of the cross section. In most experiments, the peak of the resonance is not a
speciﬁc target of the investigation, and the determination of the resonance frequency usually
proceeds based on a ﬁt of the experimental line shape with a judiciously chosen mathematical
function, e.g. a Lorentzian line proﬁle or other, more sophisticated mathematical models of the
line shape [1]. To a ﬁrst, crude approximation, the resonance frequency is the midpoint of the
half maximum points on the curve of the lineshape. Therefore, the order-of-magnitude estimates
(12), (14) and (16) indicate the magnitude of the shift, and the new line shape depends on the
details of the particular experimental observation.

We will conclude this section by stating that there is a further nonresonant contribution
originating from the possibility of the nonrelativistically forbidden, nonresonant one-photon
magnetic 1S–2S transition. This contribution is, however, Doppler-broadened [see Eq. (2)] and is
therefore negligible to a very good approximation. Its magnitude will depend on the experimental
conditions. Our result in Eq. (16) is not meant to indicate that the peak of the resonance
corresponds to the 1S–2S energy level diﬀerence at the level of precision of δω2L. For instance,
vertex corrections to the scattering which correspond to the diagram in Fig. 3 contribute at a

7

relative accuracy of α (Zα)4 [in relation to the two-photon width given in Eq. (15)], which is
larger by one factor of α than the nonresonant contribution in Eq. (16). Also, it is known that
the second-order Doppler eﬀect and the AC Stark shifts in the intense laser ﬁeld are the most
important systematic eﬀects in current experiments [1].

3 Diﬀerential measurement

We consider the process 1S–2P3/2–1S described by the cross section (3). There is a nearby 2P1/2
level which is separated from the 2P3/2-level by the ﬁne-structure interval

This is two orders of (Zα) smaller than the hydrogenic energy diﬀerence between states with
diﬀerent quantum numbers, which is of order (Zα)2. According to Eq. (11), the nearby 2P3/2
level should lead to a large nonresonant contribution of order

where the diﬀerent multiplicities of the 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 states are taken into account (in the
form of the additional factor 1/2 – there are only two nonresonant 2P1/2 levels, but four 2P3/2
levels). This shift, which is of the order of δν = δω/(2π) = 0.45 MHz, could be within the
range of current measurements, even though it has to be compared to the natural width of the
hydrogenic 2P states which is of the order of Γ(2P) = 0.2 GHz.

The obvious idea would be to switch “on or oﬀ” the nonresonant contribution from the
nearby 2P1/2 state. This can be reached by switching from a measurement with polarized light
and spin-unpolarized hydrogen to a measurement with polarized light and spin-polarized atomic
hydrogen.

4 Conclusions

We have analyzed nonresonant contributions to two-photon and four-photon processes shown in
Figs. 1 and 2. For the hydrogenic 1S–2S transition, we obtain the order-of-magnitude estimate
3Some arguments presented in the seminal paper [9] with regard to nonresonant levels which are “removed
from the (intermediate state) m (of the two-photon process) by a ﬁne- or hyperﬁne-structure splitting” do not
appear to be universally applicable [it was argued that the smaller energy denominator in this case is compensated
by smaller transition matrix elements Dm1 in the numerator of (3)]. This argument is certainly applicable to oﬀ-
resonant states which lie very close to the initial state of the two-photon process. However, in the presence of an
intermediate state very close to the resonance state, whose transition matrix elements are of the same order as
for the resonant state, this argument does not appear to hold, and the relativistic treatment including the ﬁne
structure eﬀects cannot be avoided.

(14) for the the nonresonant corrections to the observed transition frequency. The nonresonant
eﬀect in this case is negligible on the level of current measurements (see Sec. 2), and it is much
smaller than other systematic eﬀects like the second-order Doppler eﬀect and the AC Stark shift.
We would also reiterate here [9], that relativistic and radiative corrections contribute to
the nonresonant energy shifts – a typical diagram is given in Fig. 3, and the magnitude of the
associated eﬀect is estimated in Sec. 2.

We discuss the possibility of a diﬀerential measurement by which a nonresonant contribution
from a nearby state could be detected in current Lamb shift measurements (see Sec. 3). For the
speciﬁc experimental setup outlined in Sec. 3, the requirement would be to determine the line
center – deﬁned as the frequency corresponding to the maximum cross section – to within a rela-
tive accuracy of roughly 1/400; this measurement could be feasible with the current technology.
The nonresonant shift in this case is indicated in Eq. (20).

The discussion in Sec. 3 shows that nonresonant levels which are lying close to a resonance
may result in surprisingly large shifts of the peaks of the cross sections. However, the qualitative
considerations presented near the end of Sec. 2 always remain valid: the “nonresonant shift” δω
constitutes only a fraction of the natural radiative width of the resonance if the natural width
of the transition is small compared to the energy interval between the resonant and the nearest
oﬀ-resonant state. This consideration also applies if levels lie very close to each other, and the
denominator in Eq. (12), (14) or (18) becomes very small: one example would be singlet and
triplet hydrogenic S levels which are separated from each other only by a hyperﬁne structure
splitting.

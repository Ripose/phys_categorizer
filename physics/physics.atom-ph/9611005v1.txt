We discuss the formation of antihydrogen atoms ( ¯H) in an ultra-cold positron-antiproton plasma. For
108 cm−3 the characteristic formation time of stable ¯H is determined by collisional
positron densities np >
∼
relaxation of highly excited atoms produced in the process of 3-body Thompson recombination. Relying
on the mechanisms of “replacement collisions” and “ transverse collisional drift” we ﬁnd a bottleneck in
the relaxation kinetics and analyze the physical consequences of this phenomenon.

Recently, the bound state of an antiproton with a
positron, i.e. antihydrogen ( ¯H), has been produced at
relativistic energies [1]. Succesful experiments on accu-
mulating up to 105 antiprotons in an ion trap at tem-
peratures T
4K [2] initiated the ideas to create and
study ultra-cold ¯H. As discussed in [3–5], antihydrogen
at sub-Kelvin energies is an ideal system for testing CPT-
invariance and the weak equivalence principle by gravity
and spectroscopic experiments.

Cold antihydrogen is expected to be produced by merg-
ing cold plasmas of positrons and antiprotons [6]. The
attention is now mainly focused on the formation of ¯H
through the process of Thompson capture in 3-body col-
lisions

Neutral (anti)atoms ¯H∗ produced in this process have

der of the Thompson radius RT = e2/T (e is the positron
charge). They subsequently undergo collisional and ra-
diative relaxation and are supposed to acquire binding
energies larger than the threshold energy of ionization
by the electric ﬁeld at the ends of the ion trap. For real-
100 V/cm) the threshold energy ε0 varies
istic ﬁelds (10
from 20 to 60K, which corresponds to the principal quan-
50. We will use the term “stable”
tum number n0 ∼
for atoms with binding energies ε > ε0, as they leave the
ion trap without ionization and can be further captured
in a neutral atom trap.

atures of a few Kelvin the Thompson process becomes
very fast. However, the formation of stable (ε > ε0)
ultra-cold ¯H is governed by the relaxation kinetics. Thus,

densities the formation of stable ¯H by collisional relax-
ation dominates over radiative deexcitation. Considering
both the mechanisms of “replacement collisions” [8] and
“transverse collisional drift” [9] we ﬁnd a bottleneck in
the relaxation kinetics and discuss the physical conse-
quencies of this phenomenon.

the system can be treated classically. The criterion (4)
allows us to use the drift approximation (see e.g. [11])

Relaxation of highly excited atoms with the transverse
size ρ satisfying the condition (5) proceeds through col-
lisions with plasma positrons and involves two leading
mechanisms. The mechanism of “replacement collisions”,
ﬁrst found in numerical calculation [8], assumes that
an incident plasma positron has an impact parameter
smaller than ρ and becomes bound with the antiproton
in the course of the collision, whereas the initially bound
positron becomes unbound and carries away the increase
e2/ρ) and,
of the binding energy. The latter is large (
hence, replacement collisions provide a fast relaxation of
the positron longitudinal motion in the Coloumb well
U (ρ, z). Already after a few replacement collisions the
longitudinal motion comes to thermal equilibrium with
the background plasma and the positron oscillates in the
bottom of the Coulomb well, with the characteristic am-
ρ. Hence, the atom size
plitude zT ∼

ρ, and the binding energy is related to the trans-
verse size by ε = e2/ρ.

The most important consequence of replacement col-
lisions is the increase of the binding energy of the atom
and, accordingly, decrease of the atom size ρ. The fre-
neρ2vT and the
quency of replacement collisions is
change of the size in each collision is of order ρ itself.
Therefore, the time dependence of the size can be found
from the equation

For ˙ρ, ρ treated as ensemble averages the validity of

The rate of replacement collisions is independent of
the magnetic ﬁeld. These collisions provide eﬃcient re-
laxation of excited atoms with large ρ (small binding en-
ergy) even in inﬁnitely high ﬁelds. At ﬁnite B and suﬃ-
ciently small ρ, but still satisfying the condition (5), there
is another relaxation mechanism, “transverse collisional
drift” resulting from far positron-atom collisions with im-
pact parameters larger than RT [9]. Due to such colli-
sions a bound positron undergoes diﬀusion in the plane
perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The corresponding
diﬀusion coeﬃcient is the same as that for free plasma
positrons due to far positron-positron collisions:

where Λ = log (neR3
The principal diﬀerence originates from the fact that the
longitudinal motion of bound positrons is coupled to the
transverse one, whereas for free positrons the coupling
is absent. Therefore, collisions between free positrons
do not change their longitudinal velocities and, hence,
do not contribute to the mobility [11]. On the contrary,

far positron-atom collisions change both the longitudinal
velocity of a bound positron and its distance from the
antiproton. This leads to a non-zero mobility coeﬃcient
of bound positrons, b⊥ = D⊥/T [9]. Thus, there will be
a collision-induced drift of the bound positron towards
the antiproton, with the velocity

The drift increases the binding energy of excited atoms
and, in contrast to replacement collisions, provides eﬃ-
cient relaxation at small ρ.

On the basis of the two described mechanisms, we can
now draw the picture of the kinetics of collisional re-

laxation. For ρ

undergo relaxation due to replacement collisions. As fol-
lows from Eqs. (6) and (8), the rate of replacement colli-
sions decreases with increasing binding energy ε (decreas-
ρb = RB(RT /RB)2/5
ing ρ) and at ρ
RT becomes
equal to the rate of transverse collisional drift. Further
increase of ε occurs due to the transverse drift, and the
relaxation rate increases with ε. Thus, the total relax-
ation rate is minimum at ρ
ρb, and this point actually

represents a bottleneck in the relaxation kinetics. The

ratio ρb/RB ≫

In the range of ﬁelds and temperatures relevant for
producing antihydrogen in ion traps [6]), the bottleneck
(BT )2/5 is smaller or of the
binding energy εb = e2/ρb ∝
order of the threshold energy ε0 for typical experimental
conditions. Therefore, the formation of stable ¯H will be
determined by the characteristic time τ (9). It is impor-
tant to emphasize that possible decrease of temperature
or change of the magnetic ﬁeld in ion trap experiments
can not appreciably reduce τ . One can also check that
the characteristic time of radiative relaxation of atoms
with binding energies ε <

Neutral atoms are produced in the inner spatial region

and return to the plasma as positrons and antiprotons.
In this case the outcome of antihydrogen from the trap

where the atoms reach the ends of the trap after acquiring
binding energies ε > ε0 and escape from the trap without
ionization. Then the rate of producing neutral ¯H by the
ion trap is determined by the rate of Thompson capture
Np/τT (Np is the number of antiprotons). For realistic
parameters of the ion trap experiments [6]: ne = 108

Abstract

To obtain the basis for combining various many-body techniques to QED in

a consistent manner, we investigate the theory of quantum electrodynamical

self-consistent ﬁelds. The reserch interest was born mainly of the electronic

structure theory, thus we consider of atomic and moleculer systems as our

main subjects. But the formalism is more fundamental. First, we derive the

quantum electrodynamical Hartree-Fock theory by using the Green’s function

method. Then we construct a relativistic Hamiltonian written by creation-

annihilation operators for electron and positron in a general form, and check

that it reproduces the Hartree-Fock theory. We use this Hamiltonian to derive

the time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory and random phase approximation,

in the operator formalism. The relativistic Slater determinant of the Thouless

parametrization is also used. Finally we discuss the applications and futher

possible developments.

1999, and given as a part of the doctoral thesis of the author presented to Osaka univ., Nov. 2000.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is natural to have an interest in the method to construct the relativistic many-body

theory ( and relativistic self-consistent ﬁelds ). There are also many physical situations

demanding the relativistic many-body theory for atoms, molecules and solids. Relativistic

eﬀects appear to be crucial in many cases. We have several relativistic extensions of many-

body theory [1–3], but almost all of them are approximate theories from the beginning,

not the fully relativistic formalism. The Hamiltonian is given under some assumption and

approximation. Therefore they have validities and limitations.

In the case of relativistic

electronic structure theory, there are several approximation schemes. The famous Dirac-Fock

method is based on the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit no-sea (the approximation completely neglects

the eﬀects of the Dirac sea) Hamiltonian [1]. It has a Dirac type one-body Hamiltonian,

and describes the interaction of electrons via the Coulomb potential and Breit operator.

This Hamiltonian with several many-body schemes (Hartree-Fock, relativistic many-body

perturbation theory, so on) give good numerical results for neutral heavy elements. But

it can not be applied, for example, to describe the inner-core electrons of heavy elements

or, electrons of highly ionized heavy elements such as lithium-like uranium. Because in

these cases, quantum electrodynamical, QED, eﬀects (such as the vacuum polarization or

the electron self-energy) can not be negrected, we must take the Dirac sea into account.

There is also a theoretical treatment for taking account of these QED eﬀects [3]. This

method is based on the Furry picture of QED, and the QED corrections are estimated

perturbatively with the renormalization procedure. This method gives very accurate results

for highly charged ions. But it gives only correction. This method is not based on a single

principle from beginning to the end: It must be combined with the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit

no-sea scheme, for comparing with the experimantal value. Practically it treats only the

one-particle QED eﬀects, and the problem is reduced to that of hydrogen-like atoms. A

matter of course, this method is only valid for the systems of a few electrons.

A theory suitable for description of the interaction between electrons is intrinsically

2

QED [4]. Electrons interact by exchaging a photon intermediately. Only QED can fully

describe such a situation. Thus we have a fundamental question that how to construct a

relativistic many-body theory based on QED in a consistent manner. And also how we

can construct the self-consistent ﬁelds in QED, which it should be the central theme of

the many-body theory in QED. In the nonrelativistic theory, there are various many-body

techniques, and these methods are used in atoms, molecules, solids and nuclear systems. A

large part of them is constructed in the operator method, and people use them in discussions,

not only for stational properties but also for dynamical processes. It should be fruitful if

these many-body techniques are applied to QED. It should enlarge the ability of QED, and

should overcome the limitation of validity of it. By these considerations, we investigate a

general formalism for the many-body theory in QED, especially the self-consistent mean-

ﬁelds.

In Sec.II, we derive the quantum electrodynamical Hartree-Fock (HF) theory by

using the Green’s function formalism. By this method, we can introduce the HF theory

with no ambiguity. Thus we regard the result as the basis for our next step of investigation.

In Sec.III, we give a relativistic Hamiltonian which is explicitly written by the creation-

annihilation operators. We present a evidence that this Hamiltonian obtains the same result

for the HF, with the Green’s function method given in Sec.II. With this Hamiltonian, we

examine the method introduced from the nonrelativistic many-body theory in the operator

formalism, and derive the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory , HF condition, and

random phase approximation (RPA). We expect that the operator formalism will extract

the capability of our theory. In this paper we mainly focus on the formalism. But we also

discuss the possibilities of our theory, especially in applications of atomic physics, in Sec.IV.

In Sec.V, some general conclusion with summary, discussions of the remaining problems and

the futher developments, are presented. We also present the ﬁnite-temperature quantum

electrodynamical HF theory in appendix.

II. DERIVATION OF THE HARTREE-FOCK THEORY BY USING GREEN’S

FUNCTION FORMALISM

In this section we introduce a QED Lagrangian and Hamiltonian, and then we derive

the Hartree-Fock theory by the ﬁeld-theoretical Green’s function method. Some parts of

the contents were given in literature [5–9]. But Eq.(21) is our original result. The form of

Eq.(21) will become the basis of our theory developed in Sec.III. Here we intend to conﬁrm

the theory and to construct the basis for later investigation. We use the metric convention

as ds2 = gµνdxµdxν = (dx0)2 − (dx1)2 − (dx2)2 − (dx3)2, and the metric tensors are deﬁned

as gµν = diag(1, −1, −1, −1).

The starting point for our discussion is the following QED Lagrangian

L(x) = −

Fµν(x)F µν(x) + ¯ψ(x)(iγµ∂µ − m0)ψ(x) + e ¯ψ(x)γµψ(x)(Aµ(x) + A(e)

µ (x)),

(1)

1
4

where ψ(x) designates the electron-positron ﬁeld, m0 as its bare mass, and γµ is the usual

Dirac gamma matrix. The convention e = |e| is used. The anti-symmetric electromagnetic

tensor is deﬁned by Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ. Aµ is the electromagnetic potential and A(e)

µ is the

external ﬁeld. To consider the atomic situation, we introduce the static Coulomb potential

of nucleus and write it as A(e)

0 = U(r), where it is in fact nonrelativistic and classical. Now

the coordinates describing the system are ﬁxed at a nucleus which is located at the origin.

As long as we treat the interaction between the nucleus and electrons by the external ﬁeld

approximation, it is diﬃcult to describe the retardation eﬀects. We suppose it is diﬃcult to

construct a fully Lorentz covariant theory in our situation. But it is enough for our aim in

this paper. Here we also negrect the recoil eﬀect of the nucleus.

Adopting the action principle, we obtain the equations of motions (in the Lorentz gauge)

∂µF µν = (∂2

0 − ∇2)Aν = −e ¯ψγνψ,

(iγµ∂µ − m0 − γ0U(r))ψ = −eγµAµψ.

(2)

(3)

Now we use the well known canonical quantization scheme for the Dirac ﬁelds

β(x0, y)} = δαβδ(x − y),

{ ˆψα(x0, x), ˆψβ(x0, y)} = { ˆψ†

α(x0, x), ˆψ†

β(x0, y)} = 0,

where α and β denote the spinor indices. We also quantize the electromagnetic ﬁeld Aµ, but

here we do not discuss the problem of quantization scheme with gauge ﬁxing. For our aim,

it is unnecessary. The equation of motion for photon are formally solved as

ˆAµ(x) = −e

d4yDµν(x − y)ˆ¯ψ(y)γν ˆψ(y),

Z

where Dµν(x−y) is a full 2-point function for photon. Here we assume there are only virtual

photons in the system. Next, we remove the photon degree of freedom and the equation of

motion for the Dirac ﬁeld becomes

iγ0∂0 ˆψ(x) = (−iγ · ∇ + m0 + γ0U(r)) ˆψ(x) + e2

d4yγµ ˆψ(x)Dµν(x − y)ˆ¯ψ(y)γν ˆψ(y).

After these preparations, we derive the HF theory by using the Green’s functions and

Feynman rules. This method is famous in the textbook for the nonrelativistic many-body

theory [10], and here we extend it straightforwardly. In the perturbation theory based on

the Dyson equations, the HF approximation is deﬁned as an inﬁnite-order summation of

speciﬁc diagrams in expanding the fermion 2-point function [5–8,10]. Here we also obey this

ansatz and take into account two diagrams as the lowest order vacuum polarization and

fermion self-energy, in the central ﬁeld. Thus we obtain the next formula for the HF total

In (9), we also perform the Fourier transformation in time and employ the energy contour

integration. For this purpose we must decide the integration path [7], so we will examine

the structure of the 4-current because in (8) and (9), the interaction terms are written in

the form of current-current interactions. If we choose the current operator which is normal-

ordered about the Dirac vacuum, its vacuum expectation value vanishes in the zeroth-order.

Consider, for example when we introduce an external ﬁeld generated by a nucleus and

describe the system by using the Furry picture [3,11], the vacuum polarization is observed

around the nucleus, so the vacuum expectation value of the current becomes non-zero even

in the zeroth-order [3]. This situation becomes more clear if we concern to the fact that the

zeroth-order in the Furry picture already involves an inﬁnite order of summation in which

each term is expanded by the external ﬁeld. We want to include the vacuum polarization

eﬀect in our theory. For this purpose, the current generally have to be calculated by the

Schwinger’s expression [8,12]

sums cancel, but for the ﬁeld present case two sums do not cancel completely but diverge (it

must be mentioned that if there is no external ﬁeld and the system is homogeneous like the

electron gas, the normal-ordered current gives same result with above deﬁnition). Hereby

this result should be interpreted as describing the vacuum polarization eﬀect. To obtain a

ﬁnite value, we must perform the renormalization procedure. Now the HF current with the

vacuum polarization becomes

With these observations, we conclude that the HF total energy should be written by the

reﬂects time-ordering of ﬁeld operators in the propagator, to be symmetric and use both the

upper and lower halves of the integration contour. Using the following equation

(21)

In (21), we handle not only N-electrons but inﬁnite number of interacting electrons and

positrons. It is essentially diﬀerent from the non-relativistic theories. The direct term and

the exchange term give the quantum correction self-consistently. In the direct term, there is

no energy-ﬂow and the photon propagator becomes an instantaneous Coulomb interaction,

while for the exchange term the exponent in the propagator has the energy diﬀerence and it

describes the retardation eﬀect. Both the Dirac sea and the Fermi sea contain the Hartree-

Fock quasi-particles.

The (21) involves two types of divergences. One is the zero-point energy of the fermion

system, while other has its origin in the interaction between particles.

In principle, the

zero-point energy can be removed by a simple subtraction, EHF = E − EZP , and it gives

the redeﬁnition of the HF total energy. Here we use the next deﬁnition for the zero-point

energy

where iS(0)

F (x, y) = h0|T ˆψ(x)ˆ¯ψ(y)|0i is the free, and no-external-ﬁeld fermion propagator.

On the other hand, the divergences which originate from the interaction must be treated by

the renormalization methods in the quantum ﬁeld theory [4]. For this purpose we should

introduce some reasonable cut-oﬀ, and prepare the renormalization constants. But in the

above case we can not apply the commonly used method for the ﬁeld theory. There is a

large number of eﬀorts to perform the renormalization in atomic QED calculations [3]. All

of them are based on the perturbative QED. We have not met any of non-perturbative

renormalization in QED, which can be applied to our thoery. This problem still remains as

an open question.

III. OPERATOR FORMALISM

The most part of QED in literature treats the translation and Lorentz invariant vac-

uum, and which contains no external, central ﬁeld. It is constructed by the ﬁeld operators

and Green’s functions. On the other hand, the many-body theory is constructed not only

by the ﬁeld operators and Green’s functions, but also by the creation-annihilation opera-

tors, especially in the atomic and moleculer physics. In this formalism, we frequently use

the occupation numbers for the one-particle states or the density matrices, and also the

canonical transformation among the creation-annihilation operators take many active parts.

These operators and the Hamiltonian are in the Schr¨odinger representation. We can ﬁnd a

large number of approximation schemes in this formalism, and they have various advanta-

geous features. To combine these methods to QED, we investigate the creation-annihilation

operator formalism for QED in this section.

A. Hamiltonian

This subsection is devoted to introduce a fully normal-ordered relativistic Hamiltonian

for our theory. We essentially need a normal-ordered Hamiltonian, to use operator methods

developed in the nonrelativistic many-body theory. We start from (8). This Hamiltonian is

written in the Heisenberg representation, containing no approximation. The ﬁeld operators

are now substituted into the expanded form given in (11) and (12). For the kinetic energy

term we can simply take the normal-ordering, and neglecting a c-number. Also the time is

chosen as x0 = 0 to become the Schr¨odinger representation. About the interaction term,

the photon propagator is substituted by the free propagator and we perform the Fourier

transformation in time y0, and then we transform to the Schr¨odinger representation at the

time x0 = 0. We use the normal-ordered currents and take a product of them to express the

interaction term. Once more we employ normal-ordering for this product, and we obtain

16 fully normal-ordered operators with 8 one-body operators. We simply negrect the latter.

they do not conserve the particle number, but conserve the total charge of the system, as

It is clear that the naive application of usual nonrelativistic method, such as performing the

factrization and taking the pairing, does not give the expression given in (21). Then here we

propose to examine the relation between the contraction and the pairing. The contraction

and pairing are deﬁned by

(23)

(24)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

A•(t)B•(t′) = T (A(t)B(t′)) − N(A(t)B(t′)),

A∗(t)B∗(t′) = A(t)B(t′) − N(A(t)B(t′)),

11

here • denotes a contraction, ∗ denotes a pairing. The normal-order N is refered to the

Fermi sea. The relation between the contraction and the pairings is

A•(t)B•(t′) = A∗(t)B∗(t′)θ(t − t′) − B∗(t′)A∗(t)θ(t′ − t).

(31)

The deﬁnition of the pairing gives hF |A(t)B(t′)|F i = A∗(t)B∗(t′), the contraction becomes

A•(t)B•(t′) = hF |A(t)B(t′)|F iθ(t − t′) − hF |B(t′)A(t)|F iθ(t′ − t).

(32)

Especially in the case of t = t′

hF |T (A(t)B(t′))|F it=t′ = hF |A•(t)B•(t′) + N(A(t)B(t′))|F it=t′

= hF |A(t)B(t′)|F iθ(t − t′)|t=t′ − hF |B(t′)A(t)|F iθ(t′ − t)|t=t′.

(33)

(34)

Now we introduce the deﬁnition for the step function at the same times as

θ(t − t′)t=t′ = θ(t′ − t)t=t′ =

1
2

.

By this deﬁnition we obtain the following relation:

hF |T (A(t)B(t′))|F it=t′ = hF |A•(t)B•(t′)|F it=t′
1
2

hF |A(t)B(t)|F i −

=

hF |B(t)A(t)|F i.

(35)

With the examination given above, we introduce a hypothesis that the Hamiltonian given

in (23) is written by operators in the same-time T -products, and when we factorize the

vacuum expectation value for an operator product with the aid of the Wick theorem, each

contraction should be calculated by the deﬁnition given in (35).

Eq.(43) gives a consistent result with that derived by the Green’s function method in

the last section. The results given above imply that we can generalize this method to

calculate expectation values for arbitrary products of operators. We always factorize the

matrix elements of an operator product by using the Wick theorem into the sum of the

products of contractions, and the contraction is calculated after the deﬁnition given above.

It is clear from the above discussion that only the deﬁnition of the contraction for same-time

operators is modiﬁed. Later we will use this deﬁnition to derive the HF, TDHF and RPA.

It must be taken into account the fact that the operator method based on the Schr¨odinger

representation, i.e., all operators appearing in the theory obey the same-time, t = 0.

Now we assert that we obtain a basis to construct the relativistic many-body theory in

the operator formalism. The Schr¨odinger equation in our theory becomes

|Ψ(t)i =

AN

I (t)ΦN

I (x1, x2, ..., xN ),

XN XI
∂
i
∂t

|Ψ(t)i = ˆH|Ψ(t)i,

where ΦN
I

is an N-particle Slater determinant, and AN

I (t) is a time-dependent coeﬃcient.

It is clear from the above derivation, the Hamiltonian and the wavefunction depend on the

gauge. A problem, how we should be treat the gauge dependence of our theory in many-body

procedure, still remains.

B. The Slater determinant

In the Hartree-Fock theory, the many-particle wavefunction is expressed by a single Slater

determinant, and the one-particle functions are optimized variationally. It is well-known that

any Slater determinant can be written in the Thouless form [13]

(44)

(45)

(46)

where |Φ0i is a ﬁxed N-particle determinantal state. The parameter zij have to satisﬁes the

a canonical transformation on fermion operators. This second quantized representation of

a single Slater determinant is very useful in operator methods. We try to generalize it to a

relativistic form, because it plays essential roles in the later discussions.

Let us introduce several Dirac vacua

where the ﬁrst, second and third is old, new and HF vacuum, respectively. Determinants

are given as

We want to obtain a relativistic exponential operator which transforms one to another

representations. We assume the following relations for the canonical transformation:

ˆan|0i = ˆbn|0i = 0,

n|0′i = ˆb′

n|0′i = 0,

where ˆS† = ˆS will be satisﬁed. Here new operators are expanded by a complete set of the

old representation. The deﬁnition of the new vacuum becomes

Therefore, the new vacuum is formally given by a superposition of the states in the old

representaion. In the relativistic theory, the vacuum also be transformed. The relation of

two determinants becomes

Here we demand that the matrices formed by the paramerters αmn, βmn, β∗

mn, γ∗

mn should

be Hermitian. Then the exponential operator formally given above is unitary. It is clear

that the (59) satisﬁes relations given by (53)∼(56). Each parameter should be determined

in the approximation scheme, and in the HF theory they are variationally determined and

reﬂect the variational condition. Variations for one-particle functions are generated by each

operator product in the exponent. It must be noticed that the second and the third terms in

the exponent can be understood as the generalized Bogoliubov transformation to the Dirac

vacuum, which does not conserve the particle numbers, and they describe the ﬂuctuations

of the Dirac vacuum. In the HF theory, the parameters included in them would be satisﬁed

not only the HF variational condition but also vanish the matrix elements for the parts

of the Hamiltonian which do not conserve particle numbers. These conditions must be

satisﬁed for the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. In (53)∼(56), the new operators can be

interpreted as quasi-particles, and they are given by superpositions of old operators. Later

we use this exponential operator to derive the TDHF theory, the HF condition and the

RPA equations. The most important point in this exponential operator is that it gives the

degrees of freedom of a system explicitly. By this feature we can introduce many ﬂexible

approximation scheme, and can describe the dynamics of a system in detail, much more

than the usual QED treatment.

Now we must mention some mathematical points characteristic in the ﬁeld theory. It is

well-known fact that, in the theory of inﬁnite degrees of freedom as quantum ﬁeld theory, a

diﬀerent Fock space construct a separated Hilbert space, and two representations are uni-

tarily inequivalent to each other [14]. Thus expansions used in (57) and (58) give just formal

deﬁnitions. A vector of one representation can not be expanded by bases of another repre-

sentation. For example, a state for the observed electrons can not be expanded meaningfully

16

by the bases of the bare electron Hilbert space. Thus we can not treat the interaction eﬀect

by only one Hilbert space. In fact, the renormalization procedure is a transformation to

another representation. The renormalization method projects bare parameters to physical

one, and transforms to the Fock space of observed particles. Therefore we interpret that a

state of a new representation (the HF state) is formally expanded by old bases by using ei ˆS,

then we evaluate matrix elements, and have to employ the renormalization to transform to

an observed particle (Hartree-Fock quasi-particle) space. In our theory, the Fock space for

HF states is self-consistently selected with the renormalization procedure.

Using the exponential operator given in (59), we can write the expectation value of the

Hamiltonian (Eq.(23)) in a general Slater determinant (Eq.(58)) into an expanded form, by

the same way as nonrelativistic cases. Here we will write a relativistic Slater determinat as

|Φ(α, β, β∗, γ∗)i = ei ˆS(α,β,β∗,γ∗)|Φ0i.

(60)

The expectation value of our Hamiltonian is given as follows:

hΦ(α, β, β∗, γ∗)| ˆH|Φ(α, β, β∗, γ∗)i = hΦ0| ˆH|Φ0i

+ihΦ0|[ ˆH, ˆS(α, β, β∗, γ∗)]|Φ0i

hΦ0|[[ ˆH, ˆS(α, β, β∗, γ∗)], ˆS(α, β, β∗, γ∗)]|Φ0i

+

i2
2!
+O( ˆS3).

(61)

In (61), the ﬁrst line is the HF total energy, the second line gives the ﬁrst derivatives with

respect to the parameters (α, β, β∗, γ∗), and it must be zero in the HF condition. The

third line corresponds to the second derivatives and they determine the stability of the HF

state, it is equivalent to the stability of collective modes in the RPA. It is obvious fact that

the operator formalism makes possible to do these discussions. By using our theory, for

example, it may be possible to discuss the instability of the HF solution, or to apply the

coupled-cluster method in the electronic structure theory.

17

C. The time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory

In this and in the following subsection, we will derive the TDHF, HF condition and RPA,

by using the operator method, based on the previous discussions. Here it is also the aim

to demonstrate the usefulness of our theory. We take the starting point to the TDHF, the

theory for the time evolution of the mean-ﬁeld [15].

Using the Hamiltonian ( Eq.(23)), we construct the action functional

SHF =

dthΦ(α(t), β(t), β∗(t), γ∗(t))|i

− ˆH|Φ(α(t), β(t), β∗(t), γ∗(t))i

(62)

Here the time-dependence of the determinantal state is borne on the parameter set

(α, β, β∗, γ∗). Introduce the Dirac-Frenkel variation principle,

δSHF = δ

dthΦ(α(t), β(t), β∗(t), γ∗(t))|i

− ˆH|Φ(α(t), β(t), β∗(t), γ∗(t))i = 0.

Thus we obtain the stationary condition

Another form can be obtained for the TDHF equations. We also derive the TDHF equations

in the density matrix form because later we use them for the derivation of the HF condition

and RPA equations. Hereafter we write |Φ(κ)i for |Φ(α, β, β∗, γ∗)i. The deﬁnition of the

In our formalism, theories of beyond-TDHF also can easily be constructed. For example,

we can introduce a multi-conﬁgurational wavefunction |Ψ(t)i =

I AI(t)|ΦIi (here |ΦIi is a

Slater determinant) for making an action functional and adopt the Dirac-Frenkel variation.

Then we obtain the multi-conﬁgurational TDHF in QED

where the conﬁguration coeﬃcients and one-particle functions are optimized simultaneously.

D. The HF condition and the random phase approximation

The TDHF gives a picture that the presentation point for the system moves in a param-

eter space. The RPA has the meaning of the linearized approximation to the TDHF. It is

well-known that the RPA equation can be derived by several diﬀerent methods. The famous

equation-of-motion method developed by Sawada [16] can also be applied to our case, but

in our case it is too cumbersome. Here we use the TDHF equations and derive the RPA

equations by expanding the density matrices [13]. This method is convenient to derive the

RPA and also we can easily interpret the physics and relations to other theories.

First, we try to write down the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (Eq.(23)) in a single

determinant |Φ0i. It is given as follows

hΦ(κ)| ˆH|Φ(κ)i =

(82)

Next, we introduce an exponential operator to use the expansion of the density matrix by

parameters. This operator must explicitly divide the one-particle space into above and below

the fermi level. Then we introduce the next form

only the phase degree of freedom. Then we negrect the latter and

from our RPA equations by use of a procedure employed in the nonrelativistic theory. These

equations treat the Dirac vacuum on an equal footing with the N-electrons, as a many-body

systems.

Ionescu et al. also obtained an RPA equation for Dirac vacuum [17], by using the method

of Bethe-Salpeter equation [10]. They studied the collectivity of Dirac vacuum around heavy

nucleus, but could not ﬁnd the evidence of it.

24

IV. SUGGESTED APPLICATIONS

In this section, we propose some applications of our theory. Because it is besed on a

simple and natural formulation, we should ﬁnd many physical situations for our theory. Here

we limit our discussion to the atomic physical situations.

In the context of the electronic structure of atoms, there are three eﬀects in atoms: The

electron correlation, the relativistic eﬀect and the QED eﬀect [18]. The electronic structure of

atoms is determined by the relation of these three factors. The electron correlation depends

on the electron numbers and can be treated by several many-body methods. The relativistic

eﬀect becomes large with increasing the atomic number. This can be treated satisfactorily

by the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit no-sea scheme. The case of highly ionized heavy atoms, the

QED eﬀect becomes dominant and it can not be neglected. This eﬀect is treated by the

perturbation theory in the Furry picture of QED. But practically this method can treat only

the system of atoms with a few electrons. In fact, especially in heavy atoms, as the ionicity

becomes high and the electron number decrease, the many-body eﬀect becomes small and

the QED eﬀect becomes large. Therefore we argue that our theory should be applied to the

cases where the electron number is not few and the many-body eﬀects must be take into

account at least in the mean-ﬁeld level ( can not apply Furry picture perturbation scheme, in

practice ) , also the QED eﬀects are strong and can not be neglected. Thus heavy elements

in middle level of ionicity should be one of the subject of our theory. The Dirac-Coulom-

Breit no-sea scheme has been applied to only neutral or almost neutral atoms. The method

of the QED correction works only for the highly ionized heavy atoms. Our theory should be

suitable for intermediate case between them. We can make mention that only parts of the

whole domain of the atomic physics was studied.

To explain the excited states or optical phenomena of the system, we need the information

about the many physical properties, such as the excitation energies, transition amplitudes,

multipole polarizabilities and oscillator strengths [19]. The RPA can treat these properties.

The RPA method contains speciﬁc diagrams in all orders. Thus generally the RPA gives high

25

numerical accuracy. The inner-core excitation or ionization in heavy elements like uranium,

the QED eﬀect is strong and we need a quantum electrodynamical theory. Our RPA ( Eqs.

(103) ∼ (106) )should be applied. Our RPA is suitable for the phenomena where both the

electron correlation and QED eﬀect is important.

In the heavy-ion collision, if the nuclear charges are large enough, a spontaneous electron-

positron pair creation occurs. Our RPA can give all types of excitations ( electron excitation,

ionization, pair-creation ) which will be happened in the heavy-ion collision. Futhermore, in

these collisions, the adiabaticity breaks down. In such a strange chemical reaction we should

treat the dynamics of the electrons and nuclei on an equal footing. There is a method that

does not use the adiabatic potential energy sufaces but uses the time-dependent variational

principle [20]. Our TDHF ( Eqs.

(77)∼(80) ) can be combined with such a method to

describe the heavy-ion collisions.

The problem of the renormalization still remains. But if it is solved in the future,

our method should gain a large ability for numerical calculations, and should ﬁnd various

applications especially in the atomic physics. We should obtain several maps or charts for

various physical quantities in the atomic physics, which they have two coordinates ( atomic

number and ionicity ).

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we have investigated a method to construct a quantum electrodynamical

many-body theory, especially the mean-ﬁeld theory. We have given the form of the HF in

QED, and also some problems were discussed. We have taken the result obtained there as

a starting point of our study, and have investigated the operator method. A relativistic

Hamiltonian was derived on QED. The relativistic Slater determinant of Thouless form

was obtained. We have discussed that in our case, the Wick theorem should be modiﬁed.

After those preparations, we have introduced the TDHF and RPA in our theory. In our

observation, the theory showed no diﬃculty at least in the mean-ﬁeld level. All of our theories

26

include the Dirac sea as the dynamical degrees of freedom. This point is the characteristic

feature of our formalism. This feature extends the capabilities of our theories than others.

We should point out the possibility of the path-integral formalism. In a non-relativistic

theory, Kuratsuji and Suzuki developed the method using generalized coherent state (GCS)

representation [21]. The crutial point of this method is using GCS for obtaining the resolu-

tion of unity and construct a kernel in path-integral form. They gave a proof that the Slater

determinant of Thouless form can be used as GCS. We propose to apply this method to our

theory. In the imaginary time formalism, the partition function becomes

Z = Tre−β ˆH

D(α, β, β∗, γ∗(τ )) exp

here |α, β, β∗, γ∗i is the Slater determinant and τ is the imaginary time. The path is de-

termined by the movement of the coordinate (α, β, β∗, γ∗). This kernel is exact for our

Hamiltonian. If we apply the stationaly phase approximation, we obtain the time-dependent

veriation principle leading to the TDHF equation, (63). Expand in the vicinity of the HF

state by parameters, the following form is obtained:

About futher progress, we mention about the method of beyond-RPA. The RPA describes

the small oscillations at a stationary point and only suitable for describing the low excita-

tions. We can investigate, in principle, the theory for high excitation and large amplitude

anharmonic oscillations, such as the mode coupling theory. This theory should be applied to

the system which is under both the strong QED eﬀect and strong quantum ﬂuctuation. We

can also extend our theory to the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through the TDHF

formalism, the same way as the nonrelativistic theory. The works for these problems should

become in the future.

APPENDIX: THE FINITE-TEMPERATURE HARTREE-FOCK THEORY

In this appendix, we derive the quantum electrodynamical ﬁnite-temperature Hartree-

Fock theory by using the temperature Green’s function formalism. To our knowledge, no

ﬁnite-temperature HF theory has been presented in literature. But of course, there is the

ﬁnite-temperature QED in literature [22].

First, we give several deﬁnitions. The grand partition function and statistical operator

are given as

ZG = e−βΩ = Tre−β ˆK,

ˆρG = Z −1

G e−β ˆK = eβ(Ω− ˆK).

The Hamiltonian for the system is given as

The above equation includes the eﬀect of the Dirac vacuum correctly. Take the zero-

temperature limit, it recover the zero-temperature theory given in the previous sections.

The Dirac vacuum also has thermal energy, depending on the temperature and be treated

in the same footing as many-particles. (A16) also has the renormalization problem. Our

result given in this appendix should be a starting point to the next step, for example, the

operator formalism for ﬁnite-temperature mean-ﬁeld dynamics.

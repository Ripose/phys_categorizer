Abstract

The nonresonant (NR) corrections are estimated for the most accurately

measured two-photon transition 1s-2s in the hydrogen atom. These correc-

tions depend on the measurement process and set a limit for the accuracy of

atomic frequency measurements. With the measurement process adopted in

the modern experiments the NR contribution for 1s-2s transition energy can

reach 10−3 Hz while the experimental inaccuracy is quoted to be ± 46 Hz.

Nonresonant (NR) corrections have been ﬁrst introduced in Ref. [1] where the modern

QED theory of the natural line proﬁle in atomic physics has been formulated. The NR

corrections indicate the limit up to which the concept of the energy of an excited atomic

state has a physical meaning - that is the resonance approximation. In the resonance ap-

proximation the line proﬁle is described by the two parameters: energy E and width Γ .

Beyond this approximation the speciﬁc role of E and Γ should be replaced by the complete

evaluation of the line proﬁle for the particular process. If the distortion of the Lorentz proﬁle

is small one can still consider the NR correction as an additional energy shift. Unlike all

other energy corrections, this correction depends on the particular process which has been

employed for the measurement of the energy diﬀerence. Quite independent of the accuracy

1

of theoretical calculations of the ”traditional” energy corrections which can be much poorer

than the experimental accuracy, NR corrections deﬁne the principal limit for the latter.

One can state that nonresonant corrections set the limit for the accuracy of all the atomic

frequency standards.

Nonresonant corrections have been evaluated for H-like ions of phosphorus (Z=15) and

uranium (Z=92) in Refs. [2,3]. While for uranium the NR correction turned out to be

negligible, its value was comparable with the experimental error bars in case of phosphorus.

Recently the NR correction has been evaluated for the Lyman-α 1s-2p transition in hydrogen

[4]. In [4] the process of the resonance photon scattering was considered as a standard pro-

cedure for the determination of the energy levels. According to [1] the parametric estimate

of the NR correction to the total cross-section is (in relativistic units):

Here α denotes the ﬁne structure constant, m is the electron mass, Z is the nuclear charge

number and c1 abbreviates a numerical factor. Evaluations in [4] yielded c1 = −1.31 ∗ 10−3

and δ1 = −1.30 Hz. In Ref. [4] a factor 4/9 was missing in the expression for c1. Moreover,

there exists another NR correction to the total cross section of the same process, connected

with the contribution of the near-resonant 2p3/2 state (see below):

δ1 = c1mα2(αZ)6

δ2 = c2mα4(αZ)4

(1)

(2)

For the hydrogen atom (Z = 1) this correction is parametrically of the same order, but

numerically it is larger than (1): c2 = 4.94 10−3, δ2 = 4.89 Hz. Finally, the ”asymmetry”

correction, which is of the same order, arises from the resonant term when replacing the width

Γ(ω0), where ω0 is the resonant frequency, by Γ(ω). In the case of the Lyman-alpha transition

Γ(ω0) =

α3 a.u. should be replaced by Γ(ω) = (211/39)α3ω a.u. This result corresponds

to the ”velocity” form of the transition amplitude. The ”length” form that follows from the

”velocity” form after the gauge transformation would yield Γ(ω) = (217/311)α3ω3 a.u. The

”asymmetry” shift is diﬀerent for the ”velocity” and the ”length” forms. However, we should

2

remember that the ”velocity” form follows originally from the QED description and that the

gauge transformation in the simple form mentioned above does exist only at the resonance

frequency. The additional ”asymmetry” shift which follows from the ”velocity” form of

Γ(ω) is given by δ3 = c3mα2(αZ)6 with c3 =

= 1.015 ∗ 10−3 yielding δ3 = 1.007 Hz.

The ω-dependent terms in the Lorentz denominator lead to smaller NR contributions [1].

Still the accuracy for the Lyman-α frequency measurements is much poorer: about 6 MHz

[5]. Modern experimental techniques employed in Lamb-shift measurements are based on

two-photon resonances, in particular for the transition 1s-2s [6,7]. In the present paper we

provide an estimate for the NR correction to the transition frequency in this case.

The magnitude of the NR corrections depends strongly on the conditions of the exper-

iment. It is important whether total or diﬀerential cross sections are measured since some

NR corrections vanish after the angular integration. In [4] the following expression for the

NR correction to the frequency of the one-photon transition, which applies in case when the

total cross section scattering is measured, has been derived:

Here B, n, and A denote initial, intermediate and ﬁnal electron states, respectively. A′

lables the resonant intermediate state. Then ΓA′ is the total width and ΓA′A, ΓBA′ are partial

widths, connected with the transitions A′ → A and B → A′. The notations ΓAB;CD are used

for the ”mixed” transition probabilities where one amplitude corresponds to the transition

A → C and the other one to the transition B → D. Finally, EB, EA′ and En denote the one-

electron energies. In case of the Lyman-α transition B = A = 1s, A′ = 2p and the photon

frequency is close to ω = E2p − E1s. Then ΓA′ = ΓA′A = ΓBA′ = Γ2p. Assuming that the

”mixed” probabilities are parametrically of the same order as Γ2p ≃ mα(αZ)4 (in relativistic

units) and using the parametric estimate ∆E ≃ m(αZ)2 for the energy denominators in Eq.

(3) we obtain immediately the estimate (1). An explicit summation over the total energy

spectrum for the hydrogen atom leads to the coeﬃcient c1 quoted above.

Expression (3) corresponds to the interference term between resonant and nonresonant

3

contributions to the photon scattering amplitude. The nonresonant contributions arise when

we replace the resonant intermediate state 2p by np states with n > 2 and also when the

incident and emitted photons are interchanged.

In [8] it has been observed that a large NR contribution arises when taking into account

the ﬁne structure of the H atom and considering the state 2p3/2 as a nonresonant one.

Then the enhancement follows from the small energy denominator ∆Ef = E2p3/2 − E2p1/2.

However, this contribution vanishes in the total cross section after angular integration and

remains only ﬁnite if the diﬀerential cross section is considered. The latter may correspond

to a particular experimental situation but it is the total cross section which deﬁnes the

absolute limit for the accuracy of the frequency measurement. Additionally, we would like

to note that there exists also a quadratic NR contribution to the total cross section from

2p3/2 state. This contribution does not vanish after angular integration and is given by the

formula:

δ2 =

( 1
2Γ2p)4
∆E3
f

.

This can be easily obtained in the same way as Eq. (3) (see [4]). The parametric estimate

Eq. (2) immediately follows from Eq. (4) and from the estimate ∆Ef = m(αZ)4.

Formula (3) is valid also for the NR correction to the process of the resonant two-

photon excitation 1s + 2γ → 2s.

In this case B = A = 1s, A′ = 2s, 2ω = E2s − E1s,

ΓA′ ≃ ΓA′A ≃ ΓB′A = Γ2s,2γ. Here Γ2s,2γ is the two-photon width of the 2s level (neglecting

the small contribution of the one-photon width Γ2s,1γ). Using the parametric estimate for

the two-photon width Γ2s,2γ ≃ mα2(αZ)6 one obtains

|δ| =

m(αZ)2 = mα4(αZ)10

This estimate has been derived in Ref. [8] where the conclusion has been drawn, that NR

corrections for 1s + 2γ → 2s transition enter at the level 10−14 Hz and thus are negligible at

the current and projected level of experimental accuracy. At present the latter is ±46 Hz

and is expected to be two orders of magnitude smaller in future experiments [7].

The NR correction (5) corresponds to the process described by the Feynman graph of Fig.

1. However, the experiment in [6,7] is based on a diﬀerent process. In this experiment the H

atom being in its ground state is excited ﬁrst by the absorption of the two laser photons into

the 2s state. After some time delay tD the 2s state is detected by applying a ”small” electric

ﬁeld and observing the quenched Lyman-α decay. The corresponding process is described by

the Feynman graph of Fig. 2. For the analysis we will assume that for the ”small” electric

ﬁeld the Stark parameter ξS = h2s| ~d · ~E|2pi/∆EL corresponds to ξS ≪ 1. ~d is the electric

dipole moment operator, ~E is the electric ﬁeld strength, ∆EL is the Lamb shift between 2s

and 2p states. Accordingly, we can replace the intermediate 2s state in the graph in Fig.

2 by the state 2s′ = 2s + ξS2p. The resonant cross-section corresponding to the Feynman

graph of Fig. 2 is determined by

(6)

Here Γ2p,1γ denotes the Lyman-α width and ∆E(2)

s

is the second-order Stark shift for

the 2s state. The Stark shift for the 1s state can be neglected for ”small” electric ﬁelds.

However, in the real experiment [6,7] the excitation region is separated spatially from the

detection region. Therefore the Stark shift does not contribute to the excitation condition:

2ω = E2s − E1s. Moreover, the width of the resonance is deﬁned by the time delay tD,

which is necessary for the atom to reach the detection region: for ξS ∼ 0.1 the decay time

in the electric ﬁeld is (ξ2

SΓ2p,1γ)−1 ≃ 10−7 s. This is very small time compared to tD: the

characteristic atomic velocities are 104 cm/s and the space separation of the excitation and

detection regions is 13 cm [6,7]. Then tD ≃ 10−3 s what corresponds to the experimental

width of the resonance Γexp ∼ 1 kHz. Then Eq. (6) should be replaced by

The major nonresonant contribution arises from the closely lying 2p level

where Γ2p,2γ is the two-photon width of the 2p level. The interference term between σres and

σNR is absent in the total cross section, but may be present in the diﬀerential cross section.

To ﬁnd the NR correction we employ the same idea as in [4], i.e. we determine the

position of the maximum for the function σ(ω).

In the case in which the total cross section is measured we obtain

Here we assumed that ∆EL ≫ Γ2p,1γ where ∆EL = E2s − E2p is the Lamb shift. The

corresponding expressions (in relativistic units) are: Γ2p,1γ =

mα(αZ)4 = 0.04mα(αZ)4

and ∆EL = 0.4mα(αZ)4. Taking into account that Γ2p,2γ is deﬁned by the E1M1 transition

and Γ2s,2γ corresponds to the 2E1 transition, we have Γ2p,2γ/Γ2s,2γ ≃ (αZ)2. Insertion of

these quantities into Eq. (9) leads to the negligible NR correction. The NR correction to

the diﬀerential cross-section is much larger. In this case the formula of the type of Eq. (3)

for diﬀerential cross section should be used:

This limit for the experimental accuracy turns out to be many orders of magnitude

larger than the corresponding value obtained from (5). It is the value (10) which should be

compared with the projected experimental accuracy of about 10−1 Hz [6,7].

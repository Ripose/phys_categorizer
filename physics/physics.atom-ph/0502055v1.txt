Abstract

We show how to construct asymmetric optical barriers for atoms. These barriers can be used

to compress phase space of a sample by creating a conﬁned region in space where atoms can

accumulate with heating at the single photon recoil level. We illustrate our method with a simple

two-level model and then show how it can be applied to more realistic multi-level atoms.

Laser cooling of atoms relies on the Doppler shift to preferentially scatter near-resonant

light when atoms are moving towards the beam, with multiple scatterings required to achieve

substantial cooling [1]. Although this approach has been very successful, the process requires

a cycling transition, which has limited the applicability of laser cooling to a small set of atoms

in the periodic table. Further cooling below the single photon recoil limit was made possible

by creating dark states in momentum space using quantum interference [2] or stimulated

Raman transitions [3]. Dark states in position space have been based on creating selective

regions where laser cooling turns oﬀ due to optical pumping to a dark state [4, 5]. More

recently collective-emission-induced cooling was demonstrated using an optical cavity [6].

Compression of phase space beyond laser cooling has been accomplished by evaporation.

We consider in this Letter a diﬀerent approach to compression of phase space which

utilizes an asymmetric optical barrier that conﬁnes atoms in one state but not another.

Spontaneous emission is used only as an irreversible way to transfer atoms from one state to

another when they are in the trap. The laser then reduces the entropy of the atomic cloud

by increasing the density with a minimal increase in the kinetic energy.

The original motivation for this work came from plasma physics where it was shown that

a ponderomotive potential in the radio frequency regime in a magnetic ﬁeld could be made

as an eﬃcient asymmetric barrier for electrons or ions, thereby driving electrical currents

with little power dissipation [7]. Thus, the question to ask is: can we construct in the optical

regime a barrier that transmits atoms coming from one side but reﬂects atoms coming from

the other side?

To answer this question, we ﬁrst construct a simple model. Consider a two-level atom

transition, while another beam, denoted RES, is tuned exactly on resonance, as shown in

Fig. 1(a). We construct a barrier as shown in Fig. 1(b); On the left side is a focused RES

sheet, and to the right of that a focused B sheet. An atom impinging from the right will

encounter the B sheet which is a repulsive barrier and it will be reﬂected back. In contrast,

an atom impinging on the barrier from the left will ﬁrst be promoted to the excited state

i

2

with some probability. It then encounters the barrier which is attractive for that state,

|
so it goes through (neglecting quantum reﬂection). We must assume that the spontaneous

lifetime is longer than the transit time of the atom through the barrier, and that the atom

decays to the ground state after crossing the barrier. Clearly, this wall reﬂects atoms from

the right and transmits them from the left. How can such a barrier be used to compress

phase space? Consider a 1D (one-dimensional) box of length L with a spatially uniform

distribution of atoms. Now suppose we turn on a uni-directional barrier somewhere in the

box, as shown in Fig. 2(a). After some time, all the atoms will be trapped in one region, as

illustrated in Fig. 2(b).

To study this simple model further, we have performed a Monte-Carlo simulation and

compared with a simple analytic model. We start with atoms uniformly distributed in a

1D box and with a Maxwell distribution in velocity with standard deviation σv. A semi-

penetrable wall with width 2d separates the box into two parts with widths l1 > l2, so that

resonant part of the wall with width d borders with longer side and the blue detuned part

of the same width borders the shorter side. We assume that external walls of the box are

repulsive for both states. As soon as an atom enters the resonant beam, it gets transferred

to state

for which the second half of the wall is attractive [8]. We simulated exponential

decay of the atom with decay time τ . As the atom decays it gains one recoil velocity vr in a

random direction. The velocity relaxation time is much longer than time to accumulate in

the small region: in the simulation we record velocity of a test particle as soon as it reaches

the smaller region and gets a recoil kick in a random direction. Three diﬀerent cases are

considered in the simulation: (I) Decay occurs in the small region. In this case, the particle

is trapped. (II) Decay occurs in the large region or in the resonant beam.

In this case,

the particle is not trapped, but gets another chance and eventually will be trapped. (III)

Decay occurs in the repulsive wall. In that case, the particle is considered lost from the

distribution, since it would acquire a large kinetic energy as it exits the barrier.

The model has six parameters: d, vr, τ , l1, l2, σv. The unit of length, Lu, is taken to be

d, and the unit of velocity, vu, is taken to be vr. The unit of time is then tu = Lu/vu = d/vr.

We observe how a change of parameters (τ , l1, l2, and σv) aﬀects the performance, which we

characterize by two ﬁgures of merit. The ﬁrst one is compression in phase space, we deﬁne

1D phase space density as the number of trapped particles per unit length per unit velocity,

C = e

(l1 + l2 + 2d)
σv,ﬁnal

·
where e is the ratio of number of trapped atoms to number of initial atoms. The second

ﬁgure of merit is the average rate of phase space density change C/Tf , where Tf is the time

it takes to capture a fraction f of the atoms. For the discussions below we use the time

when ninety percent of trappable atoms are captured, T0.90.

Figure 3(a) shows the velocity distribution for 50000 atoms before and after the process

for the following parameters: τ = 10, l1 = 100, l2 = 10, σv = 5. In the plots (c)-(f) in Fig. 3

variations of the parameters are performed with respect to this set. Figure 3(b) displays the

distribution of capturing times. For this particular set of parameters we ﬁnd a compression

factor, C = 9.2.

As the length of bigger part of the box, l1, increases (Fig. 3(c)) the compression factor

increases, the average time of the operation increases as well and as a result the rate of

compression saturates. For a particular initial velocity distribution and wall width there is

an optimal decay time for which the compression is the largest (Fig. 3(f)). Average rate of

compression in this case decreases monotonically (Fig. 3(e)).

Naturally, the operation of the scheme is optimal when the decay rate is much larger than

hence the scheme is only eﬃcient in the ﬁrst limit when the initial velocity spread is much

larger than the recoil velocity. In this limit it is also applicable in two and three dimensions

hence the recoil that might be accumulated in the transverse dimension will not be signif-

icant. In Fig. 3(c) we show that for appropriate decay times the agreement between this

simple analytic formula and the results of Monte-Carlo simulations is very good.

which this wall is nearly transparent. A uni-directional barrier can be constructed in this

case in the same way as for the two level model, except that the repulsive barrier should be a

beam tuned to the blue of the

transition, it will generally be completely

and the atom can pass through the barrier.

This scheme can be realized in alkaline earth atoms. For example, calcium has a ground

state

and a transition to one excited state

with a wavelength of 423 nm and lifetime

of 5 ns, and a transition to another excited state

e2

with a wavelength of 657 nm and

lifetime of 330 µs. In this case, the B sheet would be tuned to the blue of the 423 transition

(far enough to minimize spontaneous scattering) while the RES sheet would be tuned to the

657 nm transition. The resonant beam must be spectrally broadened in an experimental

realization so that Doppler shifts are not important.

For alkali atoms one-way barrier may be constructed as shown in Fig. 5. For atoms in

state

the beam M is attractive, since it is detuned to the red side of the transition. The

is not aﬀected by the beam RES and the beam M is a repulsive wall for it. For example,

beam would be tuned to the transition. Phase-space compression in a gravitational trap

using a one-way barrier will be analyzed in a separate publication [12]. In that paper we

will also extend the scheme to multilevel atoms and molecules.

One limitation of the suggested method is that typical dipole trap depths are only a few

mK. This requires therefore in the case of atoms and molecules that cannot be laser-cooled

other methods which are not laser-based. In recent years there has been enormous progress

in this direction and several methods have already been demonstrated experimentally. These

include buﬀer-gas cooling [9], Stark deceleration [10], and rotating supersonic nozzle [11].

We can ask about the density limits of the proposed method. Re-absorption of a photon

emitted by an atom in the excited state inside the smaller region places the main limitation

on density. As the photon mean free path becomes comparable to the average distance an

atom travels in the excited state, atoms will leave the region rather than emitted photons

and substantial recoil heating will occur. However for the case of the three level model these

limits are greatly extended by two factors. The ﬁrst is the small oscillator strength [14]

and the second is the large Doppler shifts of emitted photon compared with the linewidth.

Due to these considerations density will be limited by three-body loss well before photon

re-absorption.

In summary, we have shown that atomic phase space compression can be achieved through

a variety of related methods that form a one-way atomic barrier. As distinct from laser

cooling, the methods proposed here do not rely on velocity-selective resonance conditions.

Here, use is instead made of a localized asymmetric excitation in which the order of excitation

matters — so that the structure acts diﬀerently on atoms coming from opposite directions

thereby encountering excitations in diﬀerent order. Interestingly, there is a double analogy

between these methods on one hand, and methods to drive current in plasma on the other

hand. Currents can also be driven eﬃciently in plasma through velocity-selective resonant

conditions [13], including making use of Doppler shifts, analogous to methods in velocity-

selective resonance conditions for laser cooling [1, 2, 3]. The one-way wave-induced magnetic

wall in the rf regime that drives current in plasma [7], does not utilize velocity selection

8

(although, like here, the velocity selection might also be used to additional advantage).

Thus, it is the second rf current-drive eﬀect in plasma, which forms a one-way wall, as

opposed to the velocity-selective methods, that is analogous to the eﬀect proposed here of

atoms’ phase space compression through one-way atomic barriers by asymmetric excitations.

The method outlined in this Letter could be used to compress phase space of atoms or

molecules that do not have a cycling transition. It could also be used to initiate evaporative

cooling which requires a minimum density to achieve the necessary collision rate. Finally, a

state-selective barrier could ﬁnd other applications, such as isotope separation.

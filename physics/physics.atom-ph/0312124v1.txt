Abstract
In this paper we, to our knowledge, for the ﬁrst time obtain the rate equations for Zeeman co-
herences in the broad line approximation and steady-state balance equations directly from optical
Bloch equations without the use of the perturbation theory. The broad line approximation allows
us to use the adiabatic elimination procedure in order to eliminate the optical coherences from the
optical Bloch equations, but the steady-state condition allows us to derive the balance equations
straightforward. We compare our approach with the perturbation theory approach as given pre-
viously and show that our approach is more ﬂexible in analyzing various experiments. Meanwhile
we also show the validity and limitations of the application of the rate equations in experiments
with coherent atomic excitation, when either broad line approximation or steady-state conditions
hold. Thus we have shown the basis for modeling the coherent atomic excitation experiments by
using the relatively simple rate equations, provided that certain experimental conditions hold.

INTRODUCTION

Coherent eﬀects in laser radiation interaction with atoms and molecules play a major
role in the physics and chemistry. Applications, such as electromagnetically induced trans-
parency [1], laser cooling [2, 3, 4], lasing without inversion [5], coherent population transfer
[6], diﬀerent nonlinear magneto optical eﬀects [7], new methods for magnetometry [8, 9],
coherent control of chemical reactions [10] and many other are widely used as a powerful
research tools. Theoretical and experimental investigations of the coherent eﬀects become
increasingly important, as they open the way for more practical applications. Apart from
some relatively simple cases, when direct solution of time dependant Scrodinger equation
can be used [6], usually, when one speaks about the modelling of experiments with atomic
coherent excitation, he means the so-called ”optical Bloch equations” (OBE), or Liouville
equations [11, 12, 13] for quantum density matrix ρ. These involve both optical and Zee-
man coherences created in an ensemble of atoms. Zeeman coherences are quite stable and
therefore it is relatively easy to employ them practically – for example, Zeeman coherences
are a basic ingredient of sub-Doppler and sub-recoil laser cooling mechanisms [2, 3, 4]. Op-
tical coherences, on the other hand, are very sensitive to a variety of factors – collisions,
ﬁnite laser line-width, laser light ﬂuctuations – both in phase and in amplitude, and many
other. This means that, in describing a wide variety of atomic excitation experiments one
can neglect the optical coherences. It leads to the well known rate equations for Zeeman
coherences [12, 14]. By saying ”rate equations” we mean that they do not couple Zeeman
coherences to optical coherences.

Among the ﬁrst ones to obtain the rate equations for Zeeman coherences by neglecting
the optical coherences were C.Cohen-Tannoudji and J.P.Barrat in 1961 [14]. They used
perturbation theory to obtain the rate equations in the so-called ”broad-line approximation”
(BLA) [15]. These rate equations were obtained by considering the excitation with light from
the spectral lamp and did not include the light induced transition eﬀects into the analysis
. They assumed intuitively that one can neglect the optical coherences in case of such an
excitation. No mathematical arguments were provided, and the only justiﬁcation of the
used model was the good agreement between the theory and experiment. This lack of the
rigorous mathematical argument was overcome later by C.Cohen-Tannoudji – with a slightly
diﬀerent approach, through the use of the perturbation theory and assuming the BLA [12].
The BLA means, that the spectral line-width of the laser light used in excitation of atomic
transition △ω is very large compared to the natural line-width Γ of the atomic transition

and the spacing between laser modes δω is small compared to Γ

In this case diﬀerent “Bennett holes”, burnt by the various modes in the Doppler proﬁle,
overlap, and the structure caused by diﬀerent holes in the atomic response disappears. If, in
addition, the modes cover all the velocity distribution, the atomic response does not depend
on the velocity of translation motion of the atom and quantum density matrix ρ refers to
internal variables only. In order to use the perturbation theory, the following condition must
be satisﬁed:

(1)

(2)

(3)

∆ω ≫ Γ,

δω < Γ.

△ω ≫ Γ, Γp,

2

1
Γp

where Γp is connected to the time Tp =

characterizing the evolution of density matrix

ρ under the eﬀect of the coupling with the light beam. The rate equations for Zeeman
coherences, obtained by considering the conditions (1) – (3), are often called the BLA
equations.

In the past rate equations for Zeeman coherences in BLA were very successfully used
to analyze numerous nonlinear magneto optical eﬀects. These include, for example, the
interaction of molecules with multimode laser radiation – nonlinear Hanle eﬀect, quantum
beats, beat resonance, alignment to orientation conversion in a magnetic ﬁeld etc., see, for
example [16, 17] and references therein. This approach from the viewpoint of implementation
in the form of computer routines seems to be substantially less demanding technically than
the OBE.

On the other hand, these rate equations for Zeeman coherences currently is not an often
used approach to describe the laser radiation interaction with atomic gas. At ﬁrst this seems
obvious, as for the typical laser and atomic line-width the BLA conditions seem to be a very
special case.

However recently we have applied these equations for description of some linear and
nonlinear magneto-optical eﬀects in stationary interaction of alkali atoms with a broad
band diode laser radiation [18, 19, 20, 21]. In these cases the BLA clearly did not hold.
Nevertheless, the agreement between simulation and experiment was good. The detailed
analysis showed that for the use of BLA equations one does not always have to consider
the BLA conditions – a rather striking result at a ﬁrst sight. For example, in the case
of a ”steady-state” excitation there actually are no limitations for the use of the BLA
equations except for the ”steady-state” itself. The ”steady-state” or stationary excitation
means that the excitation light does not depend on time, which implies the same for the total
density matrix ρ(t) – and this is the case in the large number of coherent atomic excitation
experiments.

What was the reason for such a good agreement between simulation and experiment in
the above experiments with alkali atoms? After a detailed analysis it turned out, that the
key factor was the fact, that the spectral line-width of radiation from the diode lasers was
mainly determined by the phase ﬂuctuations. The problem was, that the rigorous analysis of
the limitations of the rate equations for Zeeman coherences in case of a noisy laser radiation
seemed to be still lacking. On the other hand, there has been a large amount of work (see
the overview in [22, 23]) dealing with the OBE when the exciting radiation has a ﬁnite
line-width arising from the ﬂuctuations – both in phase and in amplitude.

Thus in this paper we use the results obtained for the OBE and to our knowledge for the
ﬁrst time obtain the rate equations for Zeeman coherences directly from the OBE. We also
compare our approach with the perturbation theory approach [12] and show the advantage
of our approach. We analyze the limitations of usage of the rate equations for Zeeman
coherences in conditions of noisy laser radiation – with an accent on analysis for nonlinear
magneto-optical eﬀects in atoms. In the limit of large angular momentum (molecular case)
such an analysis, at least partially, was done previously in [24]. In this paper our goal is
to ﬁll in this gap for the atoms. The obtained results are in such a good agreement with
experiment, that we feel, that the relatively simple rate equations’ approach (comparing to
the conventional OBE approach) is far too often undeservedly neglected, when discussing
the modelling of nonlinear magneto-optical eﬀects in atoms.

II. BROAD BAND RADIATION INTERACTION WITH ATOMS.

A. Exciting light.

In our analysis of usage of rate equation for Zeeman coherences we will describe the
exciting light classically by a ﬂuctuating electric ﬁeld E(t) polarized along the unit vector e

E(t) = ε(t)e + ε∗(t)e∗,

(4)

ε(t) = |εω| e−iΦ(t)−i(ω−kωv)t.
We account for a shift ω − kωv in the laser frequency due to the Doppler eﬀect – v is the
velocity of translation motion of atoms and kω is the wave vector of the exciting light. ω
is the center frequency of the spectrum, |εω| is an amplitude of laser light ﬁeld and Φ(t)
is the ﬂuctuating phase, which gives the spectrum of the radiation a ﬁnite bandwidth ∆ω.
If the phase ﬂuctuations are completely random, then the line-shape of the exciting light
is Lorentzian. In the case of a laser this light corresponds to the single mode laser with
randomly ﬂuctuating phase.
In the case of a spectral lamp this light corresponds to the
lamp, where the dominant mechanism for the line-width broadening is determined by the
collisions between the radiating atoms or molecules. Note, that for the single-mode laser
the BLA condition (2) is not fulﬁlled.

(5)

The Rabi frequency ΩR is determined by

ΩR =

d · |εω|
~

,

where d is assumed to be the strongest atomic electric dipole moment for the transition
(transitions) under consideration.

B. Optical Bloch equations.

We consider the dipole interaction of an atom with a laser ﬁeld in presence of an external
static magnetic ﬁeld B. We assume that the atomic center of mass moves classically, which
means, that the only eﬀect of the dipole interaction of the atom with a laser ﬁeld is an
excitation of a classically moving atom at the internal transitions. In this case the internal
atomic dynamics is described by the semiclassical atomic density matrix ρ, which paramet-
rically depends on the classical coordinates of the atomic center of mass. We consider atoms
with deﬁnite velocity v, illuminated by the exciting light (4), (5), resonant with the g ↔ e
transition, in presence of an external static magnetic ﬁeld B, which removes the degeneracy
of the levels g and e, so that now we consider Zeeman sublevels gi and ei. In writing OBE,
see for example [22]

(7)

R due to spontaneous emission. This means that we neglect
we consider only the relaxation
e
other relaxation mechanisms, such as collisions, ﬂy-through relaxation etc. This assumption
means, that diﬀerent velocity groups do not interact – the density of atoms is suﬃciently
low. For simplicity we also assume that the atomic transition forms a closed system – cycling

The equations (15) – (18) are stochastic diﬀerential equations [27] with stochastic variable

. In an experiment, as a rule, we deal with quantities that are averaged over the time
intervals that are large in comparison with phase ﬂuctuation time in the excitation light
source, therefore we need to perform the statistical averaging of the above equations. In order
to do that, we solve the equations(16) and (17) (with initial conditionρgiej (t0) = ρeigj (t0) = 0)

Now we employ the relation (3) which allows us to use the decorrelation approximation
[28, 29, 30]. The decorrelation approximation means that we neglect the ﬂuctuations of
ρaiaj (t) (a = e, g) around their mean value
, and thus separate atom and ﬁeld
variables in (20) and (21):

ρaiaj (t)

where a = e, g. The decorrelation approximation in general is valid only for Wiener-Levy-
type (see below) phase ﬂuctuations [30, 31]. In the case of a general stochastic ﬁeld the
decorrelation approximation can be used as a ﬁrst approximation only for weak ﬁelds below
saturation [29, 30].

In order to evaluate the correlation function

, we assume two simple models,
which lead to similar results. The ﬁrst one is the ”phase jump” model [32, 33, 34], which
assumes the phase to remain constant, except sudden random “jumps”, when it changes
to a new constant value. This model is used to describe the ﬂuctuations from the spectral
lamp, when the dominant mechanism for the line-width broadening is determined by the
collisions between the radiating atoms or molecules [22, 32, 33]. The second model is the
”phase diﬀusion” model [30, 31, 35, 36], which assumes the continuous random diﬀusion of
the phase. This model is used to describe the ﬂuctuations from the single-mode laser with
ﬂuctuating phase [22, 35, 36].

(cid:10)

1. ”Phase jump” model.

Our analysis of phase jumps in excitation radiation is based on the detailed analysis of
the model in case of optical Bloch equations performed in [32, 33, 34].
In this work we
closely follow an approach, that is analogous to the eﬀect of instantaneous collisions on the
density matrix [22]. The random jump process is Poissonian in nature – the probability for
the phase to change N times during time t − t′ is

where T is the average time between successive phase jumps. Now we deﬁne
as the
average phase change during one jump. If during the time t − t′ there has been only one
. Obviously, if during the time t − t′ there has
phase jump, then
, as every jump in average adds one

At this point we make further simpliﬁcations. We consider the case, when there is no
correlation of the phase values before and after the jump [32]. Then T is also the correlation

time of the phase (in average after the time T the phase “forgets” its past) T =

[29, 30, 31, 35, 36]. In phase diﬀusion model the ﬁeld has a constant amplitude, but its
phase is a ﬂuctuating quantity, which obeys the Langevin equation

where ς(t) is a Gaussian random force with correlation function

which means, that ς(t) obeys the Langevin equation for Brownian motion [22, 27]

where F (t) is a δ-correlated Gaussian force fulﬁlling the correlation

of the ﬁeld in the limit β → ∞. Explicit expressions for β and b in terms of fundamental
laser constants are discussed by Haken in [37], see also [38].

The spectrum of the exciting radiation, described by (27) – (31), is given by the Fourier

but the phase Φ(t) obeys a Wiener-Levy stochastic process. As mentioned above, the
Wiener-Levy process is the only one, for which the decorrelation approximation is mathemat-
ically rigorous [29, 30, 31]. It is easily understood, as in this process the relevant ﬂuctuating

quantity ς(t) is δ-correlated (correlation time

of ς(t) tends to zero when β → ∞), and

(cid:11)
and is described by the Langevin equation for Brownian motion with negligible acceleration
[22, 27, 30, 31], which can be shown to be equivalent to the diﬀusion equation [22]. For
Wiener-Levy process the relation (32) becomes:

where we have used the fact, that t > t′.

The Lorentz proﬁle is not a good description of the wings of any laser spectrum, thus this
model is appropriate for rather small detunings. However, as shown in [35, 36], for β ≫ b
(or β ≫ △ω) in the limit β ≫ Γ, ΩR, the line-shape of the exciting light is Lorentzian with

cut-oﬀ at frequencies β.

In this case the damping term

is simply multiplied by the

cut-oﬀ term, dependent on the detuning [35, 36]. This corresponds to a more realistic model
of the laser spectrum. We also have to remember, that for the rotating wave approximation

D. The eﬀective relaxation caused by the ﬂuctuations of the exciting light.

As can be seen, both approaches give similar results for time average phase ﬂuctuation
value - the eﬀect of the phase ﬂuctuations on the density matrix is simply to add the
additional relaxation term, equal to the HWHM of the exciting light. Now we use (26) and
(34) to rewrite (19) - (22) (for simplicity we further drop the averaging brackets):

IV. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS.

A. Perturbation theory approach.

The obtained rate equations for Zeeman coherences coincide with equations obtained
earlier in perturbation theory approach in [12]. In perturbation theory approach as small
parameters are used ratios between rate constants involved in the problem (Γp, Γ) and line-
width of the excitation radiation △ω. Here we would like to stress that, however the obtained
equations coincide, the approach used in this study is diﬀerent and allows us to examine in
more detail the limits of usage of rate equations for Zeeman coherences to analyze speciﬁc

experiments. To compare both approaches, let us have a brief look in method used and
conclusions obtained with perturbation theory.

Let Tp =

be the time characterizing the evolution of density matrix ρ under the eﬀect

of the coupling with the light beam. In the following analysis it is assumed that the intensity

is suﬃciently low so that Tp is much longer than the correlation time T =

of the light

Now consider a time interval △t such that

∆ω ≫ Γp.

Tp, τ ≫ ∆t ≫ T,

where τ =

. Since Tp, τ ≫ △t, one can conclude that ρ(t + △t) − ρ(t) is very small and can
be calculated by perturbation theory. By using perturbation theory, it is shown in [12], that
the average variation of ρ, hρ(t + △t) − ρ(t)i (the average is taken over all possible values
of the random function ε(t) - see below) is linear in △t and only depends on ρ(t)

hρ(t + △t) − ρ(t)i

=

△ρ(t)

.

△ρ(t)

This means, that we can replace

BLA relations (1) – (3) hold and the relative phases of the diﬀerent modes are assumed

(39) for simplicity. The obtained rate equations are exactly the same as the above derived
equations (44), (45), but with Γp and △Ep having slightly diﬀerent form as deﬁned in (47)
– (50). This mismatch is easily avoided, if instead of the exciting light model (55) – (58) we
take the model (4), (5), (26), (34). Then the rate equations are the same as equations (44),
(45), with Γp and △Ep deﬁned as in (49) and (50).

Thus the perturbation theory approach is summarized as follows: we deﬁne ”a priori” the
BLA conditions (1) – (3) and then use the perturbation theory to obtain the rate equations
- and thus we are restricted to the BLA case.

However, in our approach we obtain the ”phase-averaged” OBE and then it is possible

to choose between the BLA (1) – (3) or steady-state (60) possibilities.

Thus we arrive to the conclusion stated above that the approach discussed in this article
allows to examine the limits of usage of rate equations for Zeeman coherences to a greater
detail than the perturbation theory approach. Therefore it can be applied to analyze larger
number of experimental situations.

B. Velocity dependence.

When we look at (47) – (50), we see, that Γp (induced transition rate) and △Ep (dynamic
Stark shift) are velocity dependent, and thus are also the equations (44), (45). This means,
that in describing the observable signal we need to take into account all the velocity groups
involved (note, that we have already assumed, that diﬀerent velocity groups do not interact –
the density of atoms is suﬃciently low). In standard method one has to determine the signal
dependence on velocity and then sum (integrate) over the velocities (of course, assuming that
velocity distribution is known). However, usually the signal dependence on velocity cannot
be found in analytical form, as can be seen from (44) – (50). Thus a large amount of
calculation is necessary to determine this dependence – and still it is just an approximation.
The situation is simpliﬁed only for a speciﬁc kind of experiments. For example, if we
consider a case, when exciting line-width △ω is much larger than Doppler width △ωD of
the atomic line (as it was originally assumed in the perturbation theory approach as given
in [12])

∆ω ≫△ωD,

(59)

then, as mentioned above, the atomic response does not depend on the velocity of translation
motion of the atom and quantum density matrix ρ refers to internal variables only. In such
a case we obtain the rate equations by simply putting kωv = 0 in (44), (45), which is the
same as to consider the atomic velocity group kωv = 0 only. Only one velocity group is also
involved in experiments with cold atomic gases, atomic beams, etc.

However, we have successfully used the rate equations for Zeeman coherences (44), (45)
in modeling of various experiments [18, 19, 20, 21]. In these experiments (59) clearly did not
hold, nevertheless in describing experimental signal from all velocity groups, we have used
the calculated signal from just one velocity group kωv = 0 (note that △Ep (kωv = 0) = 0).
It is clear, that in this case for the experimental and simulation results to coincide, we cannot
use the exact expressions (47), (49) for Γp (kωv = 0). Thus we must consider the ”eﬀective”
induced transition rate Γef f

, which in general does not coincide with Γp (kωv = 0).

p

Using the signal from velocity group kωv = 0 as the calculated signal is justiﬁed, if we

known only in some speciﬁc cases – for example, for the ”steady-state” excitation with laser
intensities below saturation – then we know, that Γef f
p ∼ Γp (kωv = 0), as the signal from
velocity group kωv = 0 is proportional to the signal from all velocity groups – see [17].
However, in most cases establishing the relation between Γp (kωv = 0) and Γef f
is rather
complicated, as it involves a large amount of calculations.

p

Therefore in analysis of experiments we have used the following approach – the signal
from velocity group kωv = 0 is calculated and then the best ﬁt to an experiment is found –
thus experimentally ﬁnding the relation between Γp (kωv = 0) and Γef f
. In order to predict
further results, we use the extrapolation and various other mathematical techniques. This
method has proven to be successful in many cases.

p

C. Steady-state excitation.

As it was shown above generally, the usage of the rate equations for Zeeman coherences for
description of time dependent behavior of atoms in laser and magnetic ﬁelds requires certain
conditions regarding absorption rate connected with light intensity and spectral width of
the laser line. At the same time very often in coherent atomic excitation experiments the
”steady-state” or stationary excitation conditions are reached – the excitation light does not
depend on time, which implies the same for the total density matrix ρ(t). For the steady-
state to happen, the system has to go over a rather large number of cycles, which means,
that the steady-state is reached only after some time, after which it remains in this constant
state forever (unless, of course, the conditions imposed on the system are changed). This
means, that mathematically we can obtain the steady-state, if we consider ρ(t = ∞) at some
certain time moment in eternity t = ∞, when we can be sure, that the system has reached
its steady-state - of course, if it can reach the steady-state at all. It is also obvious, that
for steady-state the time derivative of the density matrix is zero and thus mathematically
we can also obtain the steady-state by simply putting dρ(t)/dt = 0 for both optical and
Zeeman coherences.

Thus under the steady-state conditions we can express the optical coherences in terms of
Zeeman coherences from the OBE straightforward, without any assumptions. In doing so
we obtain the rate equations for Zeeman coherences ρgigj (t) and ρeiej (t), which now form a
set of linear equations, because of the steady-state condition:

dρgigj (t)
dt
dρeiej (t)
dt

= 0,

= 0.

(60)

As mentioned above, under the steady-state conditions in principle there is no limitations


in the use of the rate equations, except the steady-state condition (60) itself.

D. The case of large Zeeman splitting.

In the case of large Zeeman splitting, that is, when (39) does not hold, the ﬁnal rate
equations become more complicated. However, the derivation procedure, of course, is still
the same: we assume the already mentioned conditions, then simplify optical coherences
ρeigj from (36), (37), and substitute them in (35), (38). Thus we arrive to the ﬁnal
ρgiej and

rate equations, which now become more complicated than (44), (45). The deﬁnitions of Γp
and △Ep also become diﬀerent than those in (47) – (50). All the above analysis still holds.

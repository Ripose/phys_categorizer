Abstract

We present the derivation of the eﬀective higher-order Hamiltonian, which gives m α6 contribu-

tion to energy levels of an arbitrary light atom. The derivation is based on the Foldy-Wouthuysen

transformation of the one-particle Dirac Hamiltonian followed by perturbative expansion of the

many particle Green function. The obtained results can be used for the high precision calculation

of relativistic eﬀects in atomic systems.

INTRODUCTION

The calculation of relativistic corrections to energy levels of atomic systems is usually

accomplished by using the many-electron Dirac-Coulomb (DC) Hamiltonian with possible

inclusion of the Breit interaction between electrons. However, such a Hamiltonian can

not be rigorously derived from Quantum Electrodynamic (QED) theory, and thus gives an

incomplete treatment of relativistic and QED eﬀects. The electron self-energy and vacuum

polarization can be included in the DC Hamiltonian [1, 2], though only in an approximate

way. A diﬀerent approach, which is justiﬁed by quantum ﬁeld theory, is to start from a

well adapted one-electron local potential and build many body perturbation theory. This

approach allows for the consistent inclusion of QED eﬀects as well as a correct treatment of

the so called “negative energy states”. It is being pursued by Sapirstein and collaborators

[3], but so far no high accuracy results have been achieved for neutral few electron atoms.

An alternative approach, which is suited for light atoms, relies on expansion of energy levels

in powers of the ﬁne structure constant

E(α) = E(2) + E(4) + E(5) + E(6) + O(α7),

where E(n) is the contribution of order m αn, so E(2) is the nonrelativistic energy as given

by the Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian H (2) ≡ H0,

E(4) is the leading relativistic correction given by the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian H (4) [4],

E(5) is the leading QED correction, which includes Bethe logarithms.

It has been ﬁrst

obtained for hydrogen, for a review see Refs. [5, 6]. A few years later E(5) was obtained for

the helium atom [7], see Ref. [8] for a recent simple rederivation. This result can be easily

extended to arbitrary light atoms, and recently calculations of E(5) have been performed for

lithium [9, 10] and beryllium atoms [11]. E(6) is a higher order relativistic correction and is

the subject of the present work. It can be expressed as a sum of three terms,

E(6) = hφ|H (4)

(E − H0)′ H (4)|φi + hφ|H (6)|φi + α3λhφ|

Xa>b Xb

δ(3)(rab)|φi,

where H (6) is an eﬀective Hamiltonian of order m α6. It is well known that the second order

correction from the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian is divergent since it contains, for example, the

Dirac δ functions. It is less well known that H (6) also leads to divergent matrix elements,

and yet less well known that in the sum of both terms these divergences almost cancel out.

The additional term containing λ is the contribution coming from the forward scattering

three-photon exchange amplitude which cancels the last divergence in electron-electron in-

teractions, which leads to a ﬁnite result. The cancellation of divergences requires at ﬁrst the

inclusion of a regulator, a cut-oﬀ in the maximum photon momenta, which is allowed to go

to inﬁnity when all terms are combined together.

The ﬁrst derivation of H (6) was performed for helium ﬁne-structure by Douglas and Kroll

in [12]. In this case all matrix elements were ﬁnite because they considered only the split-

ting of nPJ levels. The numerical evaluation of this splitting has been performed to a high

degree of precision by Yan and Drake in [13]. Since calculations of higher order relativistic

corrections when singular matrix elements are present are rather complicated, they were

ﬁrst studied in detail for positronium, the electron-positron system. The m α6 contribu-

tion to positronium hyperﬁne splitting was ﬁrst obtained (without annihilation terms) by

Caswell and Lepage in [14], where they introduced a new approach to bound state QED

namely, nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics (NRQED). Although their original calcu-

lations happened to contain some mistakes the idea of NRQED was very fruitful, because it

simpliﬁed enormously the treatment of bound states. Its use has led to signiﬁcant progress in

bound state QED, with the calculation of the complete three photon-exchange contribution

of order m α6 to positronium energy levels in [15, 16], and [17]. It was shown there, that by

introducing a regulator, either a photon momentum cut-oﬀ or dimensional regularization,

one can derive and calculate all matrix elements in a consistent way. The agreement between

3

these calculations and the other purely numerical calculation based on Bethe-Salpeter equa-

tion [18, 19] justify the correctness of the eﬀective Hamiltonian or NRQED approaches. It

was quickly found, after the positronium exercise, that a similar eﬀective Hamiltonian H (6)

can be derived for the Helium atom. Although the derivation of H (6) for S- and P-states of

helium is rather straightforward [20], the elimination of electron-electron singularities and

the calculation of matrix elements is quite involved. For this reason the ﬁrst results have

been obtained for triplet states 23S1 in [21] and 23P [22], where electron-electron singulari-

ties are not present, because the wave function vanishes at ~r1 = ~r2. Within the dimensional

regularization scheme Korobov and Yelkhovsky [23] were able to derive a complete set of

ﬁnite operators and calculate their matrix elements for the 11S0 ground state of helium.

None of these results have been conﬁrmed yet. In this work we present a simple derivation

of eﬀective operators contributing to H (6) for an arbitrary state of arbitrary light atoms.

The results obtained agree for the special cases of the 1S, 3S1 and 3PJ levels of helium with

the former result in [12, 20]. Since we do not explicitly eliminate here electron-electron

singularities we were not able to verify the result [23] for the ground state of helium.

Our derivation consists of three steps. The ﬁrst step is the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW)

transformation of a single electron Dirac equation in an electromagnetic ﬁeld [24], performed

to the appropriate level of accuracy. The second step is formal.

It is the quantization

of the electromagnetic ﬁeld interacting with the atom, using the Feynman integration by

paths method [24]. The third step is the derivation of an eﬀective interaction through the

perturbative expansion of the equal-time Green function of the total atomic system.

II. FOLDY-WOUTHUYSEN TRANSFORMATION

The Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) transformation [24] is the nonrelativistic expansion of the

Dirac Hamiltonian in an external electromagnetic ﬁeld,

where ~π = ~p − e ~A. The FW transformation S [24] leads to a new Hamiltonian

H = ~α · ~π + β m + e A0 ,

HF W = ei S (H − i ∂t) e−i S ,

(6)

(7)

which decouples the upper and lower components of the Dirac wave function up to a speciﬁed

order in the 1/m expansion. Here we calculate FW Hamiltonian up to terms which contribute

4

to m α6 to the energy. While it is not clear here which term contributes at which order,

we postpone this to the next section where this issue become more obvious. Contrary to

standard textbooks, we use a more convenient single Foldy-Wouthuysen operator S, which

can be written as

S = −

where Y is an as yet unspeciﬁed odd operator {β, Y } = 0, such that [Y, e A0 − i ∂t] ≈

[Y, (~α · ~π)3] ≈ 0. It will be ﬁxed at the end to cancel all higher order odd terms. The F.W.

Hamiltonian is expanded in a power series in S

The sum of H(i), Eq. (9) gives a Hamiltonian, which still depends on Y . Following FW

order and thus can be neglected. The resulting FW Hamiltonian is

HF W is not unique. The standard approach [24], which relies on subsequent use of FW-

transformations diﬀers from this one, by the transformation S with some additional even

operator. However, all HF W have to be equivalent at the level of matrix elements between

the states which satisfy the Schr¨odinger equation.

This Hamiltonian is equivalent to the one derived previously in [15], after use of the identity

hφ|[p2, [p2, V ]]|φi = 4 hφ|(~∇V )2|φi

which holds for expectation values on stationary Schr¨odinger states φ. For the exact

Coulomb potential V = −Z α/r, matrix elements of HDC become singular. Nevertheless, as

was shown in [15], one can obtain Dirac energy levels up to order m (Z α)6 by regularizing

the Coulomb potential in an arbitrary way, and all singularities cancel out between the ﬁrst

and second order matrix elements.

Our aim here is to obtain the Hamiltonian for further calculations of m α6 contribution
to energy levels of an arbitrary light atom. For this one can neglect the vector potential ~A

in all the terms having m4 and m5 in the denominator. Moreover, less obviously, one can
˙~E and the ~B2 term. It is because they are of second order
neglect the term with ~σ · ~A ~σ ·
in electromagnetic ﬁelds which additionally contain derivatives, and thus contribute only at

higher orders. After these simpliﬁcations, HF W takes the form

III. THE HIGHER ORDER BREIT-PAULI HAMILTONIAN

We consider the equal time retarded Green function G = G({~r′

a}, t′; {~ra}, t), where by
{~ra} we denote the set of coordinates for all particles of the system. This Green function is

similar to that used by Shabaev in [25]. In the stationary case considered here, G = G(t′ −t).

The Fourier transform of G in the time variable t′ − t can be written as

G(E) ≡

1
E − Heﬀ(E)

(24)

(25)

which is the deﬁnition of the eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ(E).

In the nonrelativistic case

Heﬀ = H0. All the relativistic and QED corrections resulting from the Lagrangian can be

represented as

G(E) =

+

1
E − H0

1
E − H0
1
E − H0 − Σ(E)

≡

Σ(E)

1
E − H0

E − Heﬀ(E)

=

+

1
E − H0

1
E − H0

Σ(E)

Σ(E)

+ . . .

1
E − H0

where Σ(E) is the n-particle irreducible contribution. The energy level can be interpreted

as a pole of G(E) as a function of E. For this it is convenient to consider the matrix element

of G between the the nonrelativistic wave function corresponding to this energy level. There

is always such a correspondence, since relativistic and QED eﬀects are small perturbations

of the system. We follow here a relativistic approach for the electron self-energy presented

in [5]. This matrix element is

hφ|G(E)|φi = hφ|

1
E − H0 − Σ(E)

|φi ≡

1
E − E0 − σ(E)

(26)

where

σ(E) = hφ|Σ(E)|φi +

hφ|Σ(E)|φni

hφn|Σ(E)|φi + . . .

(27)

1
E − En

Having σ(E), the correction to the energy level can be expressed as

δE = E − E0 = σ(E0) + σ′(E0) σ(E0) + . . .

= hφ|Σ(E0)|φi + hφ|Σ(E0)

(E0 − H0)′ Σ(E0)|φi + hφ|Σ′(E0)|φi hφ|Σ(E0)|φi + . . .(28)
Since the last term in Eq. (28) can be neglected up to order m α6, one can consider only

Σ(E0). In most cases, the explicit dependence of Σ on state, through E0, can be eliminated

by appropriate transformations, with the help of various commutations. The only exception

Xn6=0

1

8

is the so called Bethe logarithm, which contributes only to the order m α5. If we consider

this term separately, the operator Σ gives an eﬀective Hamiltonian

Heﬀ = H0 + Σ = H0 + H (4) + H (5) + H (6) + . . .

(29)

from which one calculates corrections to energy levels as in Eq. (5). The calculation of Σ

follows from Feynman rules for Lagrangian in Eq. (23). We will use the photon propagator

in the Coulomb gauge:

For excited states, the integration contour is deformed in such a way that all the poles from

the electron propagator lie on one side, so it is not strictly speaking the Feynman contour.

One easily recognizes that in the nonrelativistic limit G00 is the Coulomb interaction. How-

ever this term is already included in H0, which means that this nonrelativistic Coulomb

interaction has to be excluded from the perturbative expansion. Next order terms resulting

from 0 and ~ lead to the Breit Pauli Hamiltonian, Eq. (4). Below we derive the higher order

term in the nonrelativistic expansion, namely the m α6 Hamiltonian, which we call here the

higher order eﬀective Hamiltonian H (6). It is expressed as a sum of various contributions

which are calculated in the following.

δH1 is a correction due to the last three terms in HF W in Eq.

(22). These terms

involve only A0, so the nonretardation approximation is strictly valid here. This correction

We have encountered here for the ﬁrst time singular electron-electron operators. One can

make them meaningful by appropriate regularization of the photon propagator, or by di-

mensional regularization. In general it is a diﬃcult problem and, as we have written in the

introduction, the explicit solution was demonstrated for the positronium and helium atom

only.

IV. SUMMARY

The obtained complete m α6 contribution H (6) Eq. (38) is in agreement with the former

derivation for the particular case of helium S [20] and P levels [12], but is much more com-

pact. Due to diﬀering ways of representing various complicated operators, this comparison

is rather nontrivial, and we had to refer in many case to momentum representation to ﬁnd

agreement. Since the present derivation diﬀers from the former one, this agreement may be

regarded as a justiﬁcation of this, and as well as the former results. We have not derived here

the term λ in Eq. (5). It is obtained by matching the forward scattering amplitude in full

QED with the one obtained from the eﬀective Hamiltonian or NRQED, and it accounts for

the contribution with high electron momentum. λ depends however, on the regularization

scheme, and once it is ﬁxed it can be obtained in a similar way as in dimensional [23] or

photon propagator regularizations [20].

H (6) can be used for high precision calculations of energy levels of few electron atoms,

provided two diﬃculties are overcome. The ﬁrst one is the algebraic elimination of electron-

electron singularities. The elimination of electron-nucleus singularities was demonstrated

on hydrogen and helium examples, and could easily be extended to an arbitrary atom. The

elimination of electron-electron singularities using the dimensional regularization scheme

was performed for the ground state of helium atom in [23], however this derivation was

very complicated and so far this result has not been conﬁrmed. The extension to more

than two-electron atoms is even more complicated, therefore a new idea which will lead to

elimination of electron-electron singularities is needed. The second diﬃculty is the lack of

analytical values for integrals with basis sets, which fulﬁll the cusp conditions. For example,

for the Hylleraas basis set only three-electron integrals are known analytically [26, 27].

This cusp condition is necessary, because eﬀective operators present in δH (6) contain many

derivatives. For these reasons the calculation of m α6 contribution to atomic energy levels

has been accomplished only for a few states of helium atoms [13, 21, 22, 23] and hyperﬁne

splitting [28], where a powerful random exponential basis set has been applied. For the

three- [9, 10] and four-electron [11] systems the leading QED eﬀects, namely the correction

17

of order m α5 have only recently been calculated. Due to developments in the Hylleraas

basis sets [27, 29] we think the calculation of m α6 contribution to lithium energy levels is

now possible, particularly interesting is the Q(α2) correction to hyperﬁne splitting, which

may be regarded as a benchmark calculations for MCDF or MBPT methods. Another

interesting example is the ﬁne structure of PJ levels, where electron-electron singularities

are not present, such as for helium ﬁne structure.

We extend an isothermal thermal model of ultracold neutral plasma expansion to systems with-
out spherical symmetry, and use this model to interpret new ﬂuorescence measurements on these
plasmas. By assuming a self-similar expansion, it is possible to solve the ﬂuid equations analytically
and to include velocity eﬀects to predict the ﬂuorescence signals. In spite of the simplicity of this
approach, the model reproduces the major features of the experimental data.

Ultracold plasmas are produced from photo-ionized
laser-cooled gases [1, 2, 3]. In these laboratory plasmas,
it is possible to study the kinetics and thermodynamics
of multi-component, strongly-interacting Coulomb sys-
tems. These systems are characterized by the ratio of
the nearest-neighbor Coulomb energy to the average ki-
netic energy, denoted as Γ = (e2/4πǫ0d)/(kbT ), with d
being the interparticle spacing.

A new class of ultracold plasma experiments has re-
cently become available in which it is possible to spec-
troscopically study the plasma ions [4, 5, 6]. These plas-
mas are made using alkaline-earth atoms, because the
resonance transition wavelengths of the ions are readily
generated using standard laser methods. The spatially-
resolved time evolution of the plasma ion temperature
and density can be measured using absorption and ﬂuo-
rescence techniques.

These ultracold neutral plasmas are not trapped, al-
though eﬀorts are underway in a few laboratories to trap
them. The untrapped plasmas freely expand, and as they
expand the density and temperature change radically.
Processes of recombination, collisional and thermal ion-
ization, radiative cascade, and adiabatic and evaporative
cooling all play important roles in how the system evolves
and equilibrates.

A variety of models have been used to investigate the
properties of these plasmas [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].
One particularly simple isothermal ﬂuid model [8] has
been surprisingly successful in predicting the general fea-
tures of these plasmas [6, 9, 13].
In this paper we ex-
tend this model from the spherically-symmetric Gaus-
sian plasma distributions to Gaussian distributions with
elliptical symmetry.

The elliptical symmetry has important experimental
advantages. In such systems the plasma expands primar-
ily in two dimensions. The practical advantage is that the
density falls more slowly than in the three dimensional
case, making it possible to study the plasma for longer
times. The Doppler-shift due to the directed expansion

of the plasma is also suppressed.
It should therefore
be possible to study plasma oscillations and heating ef-
fects for greater time periods before these oscillations are
masked by the directed expansion of the plasma. Finally,
if the plasmas are generated from a density-limited neu-
tral atom trap, the elongated symmetry allows a greater
number of atoms to be trapped initially, corresponding
to a greater column density of plasma ions. This directly
increases the visibility of ﬂuorescence and absorption sig-
nals.

I.

ISOTHERMAL FLUID MODEL

An isothermal ﬂuid model has been presented in the
literature [8, 9]. It successfully reproduces most of the
major features of recent experimental work. This model
was motivated by trends observed in more sophisticated
treatments. The basic ideas of the model will be reviewed
here, and an extension to the case of a Gaussian distri-
bution with elliptical symmetry will be presented.

The initial ion density distribution is proportional to
the Gaussian distribution of the neutral atom cloud from
which the plasma is created. For a spherically sym-
metric cloud, the initial distribution can be written as
n(r) = n0 exp(−βr2). Because the electrons thermalize
much faster than the ions, in this model we take the ini-
tial electron density distribution to be the thermal equi-
librium distribution, given by the Boltzmann factor:

ne(r) = n0e exp

eV (r)
kBT (cid:21)

(cid:20)

(1)

The lowest temperature plasmas are nearly charge-
neutral, and the electron density distribution is approxi-
mately equal to the ion density. In this limit, it is shown
in [8, 9] that for a spherically symmetric plasma that to
within an arbitrary additive constant the electrical po-
tential energy can be written as

eV (r) = kBT ln[n(r)/n0e] = −kBT βr2.

The force is the negative gradient of this potential en-
ergy. It is manifestly radial, spherically symmetric, and

linearly proportional to the radial coordinate r, measured
from the center of the plasma. The velocity, which is the
time integral of the acceleration, is also linearly propor-
tional to r. The consequence is that if the distribution is
Gaussian initially, it will remain Gaussian at all times in
the expansion.

For the case of non-spherical symmetry, the approach
is more or less the same, although the isothermal nature
of the plasma has a more restricted meaning. We will
take the initial ion density distribution to be Gaussian,
symmetric in the x − y plane, and initially elongated in
the z direction:

The initial conditions are β1(0) = σ−2

where we have neglected the energy due to electron-ion

have both T and γ in terms of β. Inserting this into Eq.

The solution to this equation is β−1
0 + ct + v2t2,
where c is an integration constant. The constant c must
be equal to zero to meet the condition that the ion ve-
locity is initially zero at t = 0 [7]. The time evolution of
the density and velocity functions can now be written as

1 = σ2

Following the derivation used in the case of spherical
symmetry, the velocity is taken to be ~v = γ1(t)(xˆx+y ˆy)+
γ2(t)z ˆz. Inserting this and the density proﬁle of Eq. 3
into Eq. 4 gives

Because x, y, and z are independent variables, the only
non-trivial solution of this equation is

γ = − ˙β/2β,

where we have dropped the subscripts because all com-
ponents have this same form of solution.

Solving Eq. 5 requires a little more care. It is straight-
forward to write down the acceleration vector follow-
ing the derivation of the spherically symmetric case.
However, the solution requires that the temperature be
isothermal in a given dimension, but anisotropic in space.
This condition allows the density distribution to reduce
to the proper form in the limiting case of a plasma in-
ﬁnitely long in the z dimension. This decouling requires
energy to be conserved separately in the x − y plane and
in the z dimension. The plasma equations for these two
spaces are now exactly identical and completely separa-
ble.

We note that for two-dimensional planar Gaussian
charge distributions, a closed-form expression for the
electric ﬁeld has been derived [15, 16].
If such a com-
pact analytical solution could be written in the three-
dimensional case, it would remove the decoupling con-
straint that we imposed in order to solve the plasma
equations. However, such a solution is not readily ap-
parent.

II. FLUORESCENCE SIGNAL MODEL

The geometry of our measurements is shown in Fig. 1.
In the experiment, the probe laser beam is spatially ﬁl-
tered and focused into the plasma with a confocal beam
parameter that is long compared to all plasma dimen-
sions. The position oﬀset of this probe laser relative to
the plasma is denoted by the parameter a. After the
plasma is created, the number of atoms in the column
deﬁned by the probe laser beam changes dramatically.

laser is represented by the solid dark arrow parallel to the z
axis, displaced by a variable distance a. At later times the
plasma expands slowly in z, but quickly in the x − y plane.
Regions 2 and 3 represent the plasma size at later and later
times. As the plasma expands, the number of atoms in the

plasma (a = 0), the number of ions in the beam mono-
tonically decreases. However, if the laser is outside of
the initial plasma distribution, as shown in Fig. 1, the
number ﬁrst increases as the plasma moves into the laser
beam, and then decreases as the plasma disperses.

The ﬂuorescence signal depends on both the number
of ions in the column deﬁned by the probe laser beam
(Gaussian beam proﬁle with 1/e2 radius w) and the ve-
locity distribution of the ions in the plasma. Because the
laser has a narrow bandwidth, atoms moving at veloci-
ties greater than ∼9 m/s are Doppler-shifted out of reso-
nance. In this section we will use the results of the previ-
ous section to derive an expression for how the plasma ion
ﬂuorescence signal should change with time for diﬀerent
values of the oﬀset parameter a.

The ﬂuorescence signal s(t) is proportional to the ab-
sorption of the probe laser beam. Using Beer’s law and
the standard approximation of small optical depth, s(t)
can be written as

s(t) ∝

n(x, y, z, t)f1(x − a, y)¯σ(ν − ν0),

(15)

where f1 is the spatial proﬁle of the probe laser beam, and
¯σ is the absorption cross section as a function of ν − ν0,
the diﬀerence between the laser frequency and the atomic
resonance frequency. Removing the limitation of small
optical depth is trivial. We can simplify this expression
by setting the laser frequency equal to ν0, and recogniz-
ing ν − ν0 = v/λ as the Doppler shift due to the velocity

transition. Equation 12 gives the position-dependent ve-
locity of the ions. We deﬁne a length ℓ ≡ Γλσ2

by a linear combination of the Lorentzian and Gaussian
line proﬁles [17], we will only write down these two limit-
ing forms. Power broadening of the line can be included
in a straightforward manner [18].

We take the plasma density proﬁle from Eq. 11, and

III. ULTRACOLD CALCIUM PLASMAS

We create ultracold neutral plasmas by photoioniz-
ing laser-cooled calcium atoms in a magneto-optical trap
(MOT). The calcium MOT is formed in the usual way
by three pairs of counter-propagating laser beams that
intersect at right angles in the center of a magnetic
quadrupole ﬁeld [19]. The 423 nm laser light required
for the calcium MOT is generated by frequency-doubling
an infrared laser in periodically-poled KTP (PPKTP),
and has been described previously [20]. A diode laser
master-oscillator-power-ampliﬁer (MOPA) system deliv-
ers 300 mW single frequency at 846 nm, as shown in Fig.
2. This laser is phase-locked to a build-up cavity using
the Pound-Drever-Hall technique [21], giving a power en-
hancement of 30. A 20mm long PPKTP crystal in the
small waist of the build-up cavity is used to generate
typically 45 mW output power at 423 nm [22, 23].

The laser is further stabilized by locking the 423 nm
light to the calcium resonance transition using saturated
absorption spectroscopy in a calcium vapor cell [24]. Our
vapor cell diﬀers from Ref. [24] in that it has a stainless
steel body with conﬂat metal seals and windows and a
valve. An acousto-optic modulator (AOM) in one arm
of the saturated absorption laser beams shifts the laser
frequency so that the laser beam sent to the MOT is
35 MHz (one natural linewidth) below the atomic res-
onance. We also use the AOM to chop this beam and
use a lock-in ampliﬁer to eliminate the Doppler back-
ground in the saturated absorption signal. Because the
846 nm laser is already locked to the frequency-doubling
cavity, the feedback from this second lock circuit servos
the frequency-doubling cavity length.

The trap is loaded from a thermal beam of calcium
atoms that passes through the center of the MOT. The
thermal beam is formed by heating calcium in a stainless
steel oven to 650o C. The beam is weakly collimated by
a 1mm diameter, 10mm long aperture in the oven wall.
The distance between the oven and the MOT is approx-
imately 10 cm. As the beam passes through the MOT,
the slowest atoms in the velocity distribution are cooled
and trapped. An additional red-detuned (140 MHz, or
four times the natural linewidth) laser beam counter-
propagates the calcium atomic beam, signiﬁcantly en-
hancing the MOT’s capture eﬃciency. To prevent op-
tical pumping into metastable dark states we also em-
ploy a diode laser at 672 nm. The density proﬁle of the
MOT has an asymmetric Gaussian proﬁle and is well-
represented by Eq. 11 with the peak density equal to
4 × 109 cm−3, σ0 = 0.5 mm, and α = 2.5.

We photo-ionize the atoms in the MOT using a two-
color, two-photon ionization process. A portion of the
846 nm diode laser radiation from the MOT laser is
pulse-ampliﬁed in a pair of YAG-pumped dye cells and
frequency doubled. This produces a 3 ns-duration laser
pulse at 423 nm with a pulse energy around 1 µJ. This
laser pulse passes through the MOT, and its peak in-

tensity is a few thousand times greater than the satura-
tion intensity. A second YAG-pumped dye laser at 390
nm counter-propagates the 423 nm pulse and excites the
MOT atoms to low-energy states in the region of the ion-
ization potential. We photo-ionize 85-90% of the ground-
state atoms in the MOT. The minimum initial electron
temperature is limited by the bandwidth of the 390 nm
laser to about 1 K.

Ions in the plasma scatter light from a probe laser
beam tuned to the Ca II 2S1/2 −2 P1/2 transition at 397
nm. The probe laser is generated by a grating-stabilized
violet diode laser. This laser, as well as the 672 nm laser
used in the neutral atom trap, is locked to the calcium
ion transition using the DAVLL technique [25] in a large-
bore, low-pressure hollow cathode discharge of our own
design (see Fig. 3).

The probe laser is spatially ﬁltered. The typical probe
laser intensity is a few hundred µW focused to a Gaus-
sian waist of 130 µm in the MOT. We average repeated
measurements of the scattered 397 nm radiation with the
probe laser in a given position, denoted by the param-
eter a in Fig. 1. This produces a time-resolved signal
proportional to the number of atoms resonant with the
probe beam in a particular column of the plasma. By
translating a mirror just outside the MOT chamber, we
scan the probe laser across the ion cloud. In this manner
we obtain temporal and spatial information about the
plasma expansion.

the initial electron energy of the plasma, and therefore
the expansion velocity ve, was ﬁxed, and the parameter
a was varied from 0 to 4σ0.

In the following, we present a complementary compar-
ison. The solid line in Fig. 4 shows ion ﬂuorescence
signal with the probe laser tuned to the ion resonance
frequency, and with the probe laser beam propagating
along the z axis (a = 0 in Fig. 1) for a range of initial
electron energies.

As discussed in Ref.

[6], the early rise in the ﬂuores-
cence signal shows the increasing number of plasma ions
in the 2P1/2 level. This feature is easily explained in
terms of the classic Rabi two-level atom with damping.
The probe laser intensity is in the range of 5 to 10 times
the resonance Rabi frequency. Our numerical integration
of the optical Bloch equations mimics the approximately
20 ns rise time observed in the experimental data, and
shows that the Gaussian spatial proﬁle of the probe laser
beam washes out subsequent oscillations in the excited
state fraction. Following the initial rise, the ﬂuorescence
decays. At approximately t = 50 ns the decay slows down
due to correlation-induced heating in the plasma [4, 6].
These two processes are not included in the isother-
mal model. We therefore begin the comparison of the
model with the data at time t = 10−7 s. The model
is normalized to the data and ﬁt using ve as the only
ﬁt parameter in an un-weighted least-squares ﬁtting rou-
tine. The model uses the Lorentzian lineshape in Eq.
18. The justiﬁcation for using this lineshape arises from
the analysis presented in Ref.
In Fig. 2 of that
reference, the t = 0 velocity is 6 m/s. This is the rms
velocity of a Boltzmann distribution, and it is due al-
most entirely to correlation-induced heating. This veloc-
ity width gives a Doppler width smaller than the natu-
ral line width, and the Voigt proﬁle is close to a pure
Lorentzian. Furthermore, as the plasma evolves, the ion
temperature falls due to the adiabatic expansion. The
time scale for this is ∼ σ0/ve = 2 µs. This is shorter
than the time scale for heating the ions by collisions with
the electrons, ∼ mCa/meωp = 50 µs. It is therefore not
surprising that the Gaussian lineshape gives a poorer ﬁt
to the data. In the ﬁtting procedure, the Gaussian line-
shape produces expansion velocities that do not grow as
the initial electron energy increases. The ﬁgure shows
that the Lorentzian model describes the data well over a
few orders of magnitude in time. The velocities extracted
from these data are shown in Fig. 6.

[6].

The diﬀerences between the model and the signal are
not negligible. For all initial electron energies, the model
is slightly too low at t = 300 ns, and too high at t > 1 µs.
The data are not corrected for optical pumping into the
D−states, which we measure to have a time constant of
about 5 µs. The diﬀerences between the model and the
ﬂuorescence signal could indicate internal heating pro-
cesses that manifest themselves in the ion velocity on
the few hundred ns time scale. They could also indicate
ions that appear in the plasma from Rydberg states at
late times or collective plasma density variations. These

tive to the ionization limit. The solid line is the ﬂuorescence

in Eq. 18. The model is normalized to the ﬂuorescence signal
at t = 10−7 s, and the single ﬁt parameter is the expansion
velocity, ve.
In the top panel, the plasma is spontaneously
generated after exciting the atoms to a Rydberg state with
n∗ ∼ 35.7.

diﬀerences can be studied in future work.

We also compare the ﬂuorescence signal and the model
over a range of initial electron energies with the probe
laser beam shifted to a = 1.1mm = 2.2σ0.
In this ar-
rangement, the ion ﬂuorescence signal is initially small,
and grows as ions move into the probe laser beam. Typi-
cal data are shown in Fig. 5. For these data, the model is
ﬁt to the t > 6 µs signal using a least-squares procedure,
with ve as the ﬁt parameter. The velocity extracted from
this ﬁt is shown in Fig. 6. It is possible to ﬁt the data
using ve so that the peak in the model coincides with the
peak of the ﬂuorescence signal. These velocities are also
plotted in the ﬁgure.

For these data, the signal in the ﬁrst µs is small com-
pared to the model. Moreover, there are variations in
the ﬂuorescence signal that do not appear in the model.
This suggests that at the edges of the plasma expansion,
the density distribution is distinctly non-Gaussian, even
at early times before any ion motion is possible. It also

As an example, it should be possible to extend this
model to include eﬀects due to electron-ion recombina-
tion at early times. For strongly-coupled neutral plas-
mas, the three-body recombination rate should be on the
order of the plasma frequency. Using the high-sensitivity
and fast time-response of ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, it
should be possible to directly measure spectroscopic re-
combination signatures in low-temperature, low-density
plamsas, where the predicted three-body recombination
rate is greater than the plasma frequency. For exam-
ple, reducing the plasma density to 106 cm−3 will make
the recombination time ∼ 1/ωp = 20 ns. Increasing the
probe laser intensity to 100 times the saturation intensity
will shorten the early rise time of the ﬂuorescence signal
to around 10 ns. Optical pumping time will be compara-
ble to the correlation-induced heating time, around 200
ns.

FIG. 5: Relative ion ﬂuorescence signal. The probe laser is
tuned to resonance and propagates at a distance a = 1.1mm =
2.2σ0 relative to the center of the initial distribution. The
solid line is the data, and the dotted line is the ﬁt using the
Lorentzian lineshape in Eq. 18. The model is normalized to

appears, as pointed out in Ref.
[6], that the Gaussian
density proﬁle is recovered at late times for all initial
electron energies.

V. CONCLUSION

We present an extension of the isothermal plasma ex-
pansion model of Refs.
[8, 9] for quasi-two-dimensional
geometry. We include velocity eﬀects and predict a ﬂu-
orescence or absorption signal vs. time for given initial
conditions. The model matches the correct order of mag-
nitude and general features of the ﬂuorescence signal.
Some discrepancies are pointed out, which can be studied
in future work.

Making the plasmas more ideally two-dimensional
should improve applicability of the model, and further
suppress eﬀects due to expansion in the long dimension.
Increasing the range of initial electron temperatures and
plasma densities can probe interesting regions of phase

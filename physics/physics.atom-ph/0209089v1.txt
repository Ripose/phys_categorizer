Abstract

Local(multiplicative) eﬀective potential energy theories of electronic structure comprise the

transformation of the Schr¨odinger equation for interacting fermi systems to model noninteract-

ing fermi or bose systems whereby the equivalent density and energy are obtained. By employing

the integrated form of the Kato electron-nucleus cusp condition, we prove that the eﬀective electron

-interaction potential energy of these model fermions or bosons is ﬁnite at a nucleus. The proof

is general and valid for arbitrary system whether it be atomic, molecular, or solid state, and for

arbitrary state and symmetry. This then provides justiﬁcation for all prior work in the literature

based on the assumption of ﬁniteness of this potential energy at a nucleus. We further demonstrate

the criticality of the electron-nucleus cusp condition to such theories by example of the Hydrogen

molecule. We show thereby that both model system eﬀective electron-interaction potential ener-

gies, as determined from densities derived from accurate wave functions, will be singular at the

nucleus unless the wave function satisﬁes the electron-nucleus cusp condition.

I. INTRODUCTION

Consider the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation for atoms, molecules, or solids:

ˆHΨ(r1, ...rN ) = EΨ(r1, ...rN ),

where Ψ(r1, ...rN ) is the system wave function, E the energy, and N the number of electrons.
(We suppress the spin coordinate throughout the paper.) The electronic Hamiltonian ˆH in

atomic units is

where the ﬁrst and last terms represent the electron kinetic and electron interaction potential

the electrons due to the external charge Z of the nuclei at Rα:

At the coalescence of an electron with a nucleus, the external potential energy operator v(r)

is singular. For the wave function to satisfy the Schr¨odinger equation and remain bounded,

it must satisfy the Kato [1] electron nucleus cusp condition at each nucleus. The cusp

condition is usually stated in diﬀerential form [1]. In integrated form, the statement of the

cusp condition for arbitrary state of the system is [2, 3]

ψ(r, r2, ...rN ) = ψ(0, r2, ...rN ).(1

where the vectors ri now represent the positions of the electrons from a particular nucleus.

The vector a(r2, ...rN ) is undetermined.

In addition to solving the Schr¨odinger equation(1), electronic structure is also determined

by calculations performed within the framework of local(multiplicative) eﬀective potential

energy theories. Representative of such theories are Kohn-Sham density functional theory

(KS-DFT) [4], the Optimized Potential Method (OPM) [5], and quantal density functional

theory (Q-DFT) [6]. The basic idea underlying such theories is the transformation of the

Schr¨odinger equation to that of the model S system of noninteracting fermions whereby the

equivalent density ρ(r) and energy E are obtained. The diﬀerential equation describing the

model fermions is

where vs(r) is their eﬀective potential energy:

vs(r) = v(r) + vee(r),

with vee(r) their eﬀective electron-interaction potential energy. The potential energy vee(r)

accounts for electron correlations due to the Pauli exclusion principle and Coulomb repulsion,

and Correlation-Kinetic eﬀects which are a consequence of the diﬀerence in the kinetic energy

of the interacting and noninteracting systems. The various theories diﬀer in their deﬁnitions

of the potential energy vee(r). In KS-DFT, the energy E is a functional of the ground state

density ρ(r), and vee(r) is deﬁned as the functional derivative of its KS electron-interaction

energy EKS

ee = EKS

of the orbitals φi(r) : EKS
derivative of EKS

ee [ρ] component. In the OPM, this energy component is considered a functional
ee [φi]. The potential energy vee(r), deﬁned as the functional
ee [φi], is obtained by solution of an integral equation in conjunction with
the diﬀerential equation (6). Within Q-DFT, the potential energy vee(r) is the work done
Fs(r). The density ρ(r) equivalent to that

to move the model fermion in a conservative ﬁeld

of the interacting system Eq. (4) is determined from the orbitals φi(r) as

ρ(r) =

The energy is determined from the energy functionals, or in terms of the components of

the conservative ﬁeld. The highest occupied eigenvalue of the diﬀerential equation is the

negative of the ionization energy [7, 8, 9].

An understanding of the structure and general properties of the potential energy vee(r)

that allows for the transformation from the interacting to the noninteracting model system

is therefore of importance. The structure is also of signiﬁcance for the evaluation and

construction of approximations within the various S system theories. A key aspect of this

structure, and one that has been controversial, is whether the potential energy vee(r) is

ﬁnite or singular at a nucleus. The principal manner by which the structure is determined

is one that employs methods[10] which assume knowledge of the exact density ρ(r). The

3

densities in turn are obtained from correlated or conﬁguration-interaction wave functions

that are highly accurate from the total energy perspective. Work on the He atom by Smith

et al [11], Davidson [12] , and Umrigar and Gonze [13], show vee(r) to be ﬁnite at the

nucleus. Almbladh and Pedroza [14], on the other hand, showed it to be singular there.

Additional work on light atoms show it to be either ﬁnite [13, 15] or to diverge at the

nucleus [16]. For the determination of its structure for few- electron molecular systems

[17] such as H2 and LiH, the potential energy vee(r) is assumed ﬁnite at each nucleus.

Expressions for vee(r) at a nucleus have also been derived [18], but once again they are

based on the assumption that it is ﬁnite there. In various approximations with KS-DFT

[19], the potential energy vee(r) also diverges at the nucleus.

The controversy was resolved for closed shell atoms and open shell atoms in the central

ﬁeld approximation by Qian and Sahni [20] who proved analytically that vee(r) is in fact

ﬁnite at the nucleus. Furthermore, they were the ﬁrst to show that this ﬁniteness was a

direct consequence of the electron-nucleus cusp condition.

In their proof they employed

the diﬀerential form of the cusp condition. In this form of the cusp condition, the angular

dependence is integrated out. Hence, its application constrains their proof to spherically

symmetric systems.

In this paper we generalize the conclusion of Qian and Sahni and prove that vee(r) is ﬁnite

at a nucleus independent of the type of system (atomic, molecular, or solid state), and of

the system state and symmetry. Our proof employs instead the integrated form of the cusp

condition, and it is for this reason that the result is valid for systems of arbitrary symmetry.

The proof too is distinctly diﬀerent. Ex post facto, the proof thus provides justiﬁcation for all

the work on the determination of vee(r) based on the assumption that it is ﬁnite at a nucleus.

It is also possible to transform the Schr¨odinger equation to that of the B system of

noninteracting bosons such that the density ρ(r) and energy E of the interacting system is

once again obtained [8]. In this local eﬀective potential energy theory, the density amplitude

ρ(r) is determined directly. The diﬀerential equation for the model bosons is

(10)

with vB

ee(r) the corresponding eﬀective electron-interacting potential energy. The potential
ee(r) accounts for Pauli and Coulomb correlations, and Correlation-Kinetic eﬀects
due to the diﬀerence in kinetic energy of the interacting fermion and noninteracting

boson systems[21]. Once again, within density functional theory, vB

functional derivative of an electron-interaction energy functional EB

ee(r) is deﬁned [8] as a
ee[ρ], whereas in Q-DFT
FB(r). The energy is determined from the
total energy functional or in terms of the components of the conservative ﬁeld. The single

[21] it is the work done in a conservative ﬁeld

eigenvalue µ is the chemical potential or the negative of the ionization energy.

In this paper we also prove that the potential energy vB

ee(r) is ﬁnite at a nucleus. The
proof is again general and valid for systems of arbitrary state and symmetry, and also

employs the integrated form of the cusp condition.

As a second component to the paper, we demonstrate the criticality of the electron-

nucleus cusp condition to the ﬁniteness of the potential energies vee(r) and vB

ee(r) at a
nucleus by application to the Hydrogen molecule. It becomes evident thereby that densities

derived from wave functions that do not satisfy the cusp condition lead to potential energies

that are singular at a nucleus, irrespective of how accurate the wave functions may be from

an energy standpoint.

II. CRITICALITY OF CUSP CONDITION—APPLICATION TO THE HYDRO-

For two electron systems in their ground state such as the Helium atom, Hooke’s atom,

and Hydrogen molecule, the S and B systems are equivalent. This is because the S system

orbital is then φi(r) =

ρ(r)/2, i = 1, 2. Hence, the demonstration of the signiﬁcance of

q

the cusp condition as applied to the Hydrogen molecule is equally valid for both systems.

(In this example, the S system diﬀerential equation has only one eigenvalue.) It is evident,

therefore, that the singularity in v(r) at each nucleus must be cancelled by the

term in order for vee(r) or vB

ee(r) to be ﬁnite there.

In our calculations we employ the accurate gaussian geminal wave function of Komasa

and Thakkar [22] for the Hydrogen molecule which is spin free and of the form

(14)

for each k. The individual exponential parameters are allowed to become negative as

long as square-integrability is satisﬁed. The ground state energy obtained with this wave

function is E =

1.174475313 a. u. and that of the most accurate correlated wave function

[23] is E =

1.174475668 a.u. Thus the energy obtained by the gaussian wave function is

accurate to the sixth decimal place. It is well known that such gaussian geminal or orbital

wave functions do not satisfy the electron-nucleus cusp condition, and it is for this reason

−

−

we employ this wave function. Additionally, in contrast to wave functions such as the

Kolos-Roothan type wave function [23, 24], the calculations are analytical.

In Fig. 1 we plot the density along the nuclear bond axis with the two nuclei on the z

axis at R =

0.7a.u.. It is evident that the density is very accurate right up to the nucleus,

±

6

and on the scale of the ﬁgure appears to possess a cusp at each nuclear position. However,

in magnifying the scale as in Fig.2, We see that there is no cusp as expected, and that the

density is smooth across the nucleus.

2√ρ(r)

∇2√ρ(r)

In Fig.3 we plot v(r) and

along the z axis about one nucleus. Whereas v(r) is

singular as expected, the

term is ﬁnite at the nucleus. Therefore, the singularity

in v(r) is not cancelled. Hence, although the wave function is very accurate from the

perspective of the ground state energy, the fact that it does not satisfy the electron-nucleus

cusp condition leads to the potential energy vee(r) (or vB

ee(r) ) being singular at each nucleus.
In determining these potential energies from accurate densities , it is therefore imperative

that the densities be obtained from wave functions that satisfy the electron-nucleus cusp

condition.

III . PROOF

We ﬁrst prove that the potential energy vee(r) is ﬁnite at a nucleus. Employing the

integrated form of the electron-nucleus cusp condition for the wave function Eq. (5), the

electron density near a nucleus as obtained from the deﬁnition of Eq. (4) is

IV. CONCLUSION

We have proved that the eﬀective electron-interaction potential energy of model nonin-

teracting fermi and bose systems that reproduce the density and energy of an interacting

fermi system in an external ﬁeld is ﬁnite at a nucleus. The proof is valid for arbitrary

state and symmetry of the interacting system. The ﬁniteness of this potential energy at

the nucleus in these local eﬀective potential energy theories is a direct consequence of the

electron-nucleus cusp condition. Since the cusp condition holds for both ground and excited

states of the interacting system, the eﬀective electron-interaction potential energy is ﬁnite

at the nucleus whether the noninteracting fermions are in a ground or excited state. The

proof is general, and does not distinguish between ground and excited states of the model

system. The noninteracting bosons are, of course, always in their ground state.

The study of the structure of these eﬀective potential energies via densities derived from

accurate wave functions now has an important proviso. These wave functions must satisfy

the electron-nucleus cusp condition. Otherwise, the potential energies will be singular at a

nucleus, thereby leading to erroneous conclusions regarding their structure.

+ and D2

A procedure is described for the precise nonrelativistic
+ that
evaluation of the dipole polarizabilities of H2
avoids any approximation based on the size of the electron
mass relative to the nucleus mass. The procedure is con-
structed so that sum rules may be used to assess the accuracy
of the calculation. The resulting polarizabilities are consistent
with experiment within the error bars of the measurements
and are far more precise than values obtained by other theo-
retical methods.

+ and D2

The separation of nuclear and electronic motion is the
underlying principle of the theory of molecular struc-
ture. The theory is challenged by recent measurements
of Jacobson et al. [1] of the electric dipole polarizabil-
+ which have a precision beyond
ities of H2
that obtained in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
The measurements stimulated the introduction of meth-
ods [2–5] that take into account the diabatic coupling
omitted in the earlier calculations and they led to polar-
izabilities that agree with the measured values within the
combined experimental and theoretical uncertainties. We
present here new theoretical predictions of much greater
accuracy which in turn pose a signiﬁcant challenge to ex-
periment. The accuracy of our method can be assessed
by the use of sum rules and we predict nonrelativistically
+ to a precision well
the polarizabilities of H2
beyond that achieved by the experiments. The method
is general and it should be possible to apply it to many-
electron diatomic molecules.

where R is the vector joining the nuclei, r is the position
vector of the electron measured from the midpoint of
R, M is the mass of the proton or deuteron, V (r, R)
is the electrostatic interaction potential and (1 + ǫ) =
[1 + (1 + 2M )−1]. We use atomic units throughout. The
change in energy of the system for small values of the
applied ﬁeld is given by ∆E = − 1
2 αdF 2, where αd is the
polarizability. Thus if Ψ(0)(r, R) is the eigenfunction of
the unperturbed system with Hamiltonian H0 and E0 is
the eigenvalue, the polarizability can be written

αd = −2hΨ(1)|(1 + ǫ)ˆn · r|Ψ(0)i,

where

(H0 − E0)Ψ(1)(r, R) + (1 + ǫ)ˆn · rΨ(0)(r, R) = 0.

(3)

Alternatively Ψ(1) can be determined from the stationary
value of the functional

J = hΨ(1)|H0 − E0|Ψ(1)i + 2(1 + ǫ)hΨ(1)|ˆn · r|Ψ(0)i. (4)

basis set ψn(r, R),

This expression for the polarizability is stationary with

The completeness of the set ψn(r, R) can be assessed
by inspecting other sum rules. Introduce the oscillator

The values of the calculated sums S(0) and S(−1)
agree with the exact values [11,12] to better than 2 parts

uating S(−2) since the summation Eq. (6) is stationary
with respect to ﬁrst order errors. The corresponding val-
ues of the dipole polarizabilities αd are given in Table II

Table II and Fig. 1 contain a comparison of our calcu-
lated values of αd with experiment and with the results of
other theoretical methods. We leave aside calculations of
the polarizability corresponding to an electric ﬁeld along
the body-ﬁxed axis [17,18]. Moss [4] employed a varia-
tional method and an artiﬁcial channel method, with a
classical description of the rotation. We are able to re-
produce his results with our procedure if we take N = 0
for the intermediate states with the consequent neglect
of Σ − Π coupling, the error introduced by ignoring rota-
tional coupling being accordingly one in the fourth dec-
imal place in the calculated polarizability. The calcu-
lations of Bhatia and Drachman [5] and Shertzer and
Greene [2] make no approximations other than in the
numerical applications of their methods and yield values
consistent to within the precision they claim with our
results.

We have determined the non-relativistic electric dipole
+ and
polarizabilities of the lowest rotational state of H2
+ to a precision, we believe, of one part in 108. We
D2
expect that relativistic corrections will enter at the level
of one part in 105 based on known corrections for the
hydrogen atom [19]. Other eﬀects arising from the ﬁnite
size of the nucleus and nuclear spin will be still smaller.
A new analysis of the experimental data [1] incorporating
our values of the sum rules may yield improved estimates
of other properties that enter the interpretation.

[10] The basis functions utilized here depend on nonlinear
scaling parameters α, β, and γ. The nonlinear param-
eter γ appearing in the vibrational sector basis func-
tions of Ref. [9] was replaced in the present work by
γn = (2n + β + 1)−1γ, where n is the order of the La-
guerre polynomial. Parameters used in the present calcu-
+ are α = 2.7, β = 77, and
lations for both H2
γ = 3500 for the Σu functions and α = 2.8, β = 77, and
γ = 3500 for the Πu functions. They diﬀer from those
determined in Ref. [9], where the emphasis was on ob-
taining minimum values for the energies. In the present
work we demanded maximum values of the polarizabili-
ties in optimizing the Σu and Πu states. The values of the
nonlinear parameters for the ground electronic Σg state
are identical with those of Ref. [9].

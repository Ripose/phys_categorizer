The specular reﬂectivity of slow, metastable neon atoms from a silicon surface was found to increase
markedly when the ﬂat surface was replaced by a grating structure with parallel narrow ridges. For a
surface with ridges that have a suﬃciently narrow top, the reﬂectivity was found to increase more than
two orders of magnitude at the incident angle θ of 10 mRad from the surface. The slope of the reﬂectivity
vs θ near zero was found to be nearly an order of magnitude smaller than that of a ﬂat surface. A grating
with 6.5 % eﬃciency for the ﬁrst-order diﬀraction was fabricated by using the ridged surface structure.

Quantum reﬂection[1] of a particle is a reﬂection
of wave nature that occurs as a result of impedance
mismatch at a steep slope of interacting potential.
The reﬂection occurs equally even when the particle
is moving along the downhill slope of the potential.
The reﬂectivity depends on the steepness of the
spatial variation of the potential and approaches
unity when the kinetic energy of the particle ap-
proaches zero. Quantum reﬂection was veriﬁed ex-
perimentally by the reﬂection of helium and hy-
drogen atoms on a liquid helium surface[2, 3, 4, 5]
and, more recently, by the detection of specular re-
ﬂection of metastable neon atoms from silicon and
glass surfaces[1], which was caused by the attrac-
tive van der Waals potential near the surface. The
quantum reﬂection due to the van der Waals po-
tential occurs at a distance many times larger than
the atomic separation of the solid, and the atomic
scale irregularity of the solid surface is averaged
out. The surface of the deﬂection is clearly deﬁned
within the distance of the de Broglie wavelength of
an atom colliding on the surface. These features
are in remarkable contrast to those of atom reﬂec-
tors developed to date and closely resemble clas-
sical optical reﬂectors. Therefore, in principle, it
should be possible to use quantum reﬂection as a
tool to make simple, stable and nondispersive atom
reﬂectors. However, the reﬂectivity from a ﬂat solid
surface decreases so rapidly with atomic velocity
that its practical application is almost inconceiv-
able. We discuss and experimentally demonstrate
a new technique that improves the reﬂectivity many
orders of magnitude by modifying the surface of the

solid. By making the surface periodically ridged
with a narrow ﬂat top, we improved the reﬂectivity
more than two orders of magnitude at an incident
angle of 10 mRad. As an example of its application,
we fabricated a reﬂective grating that had an eﬃ-
ciency of 6.5 % for the ﬁrst-order diﬀracted atomic
wave.

The atom will feel spatial variation of poten-
tial suﬃciently steep when the change in the lo-
0 − 2mU/¯h2 within the dis-
k2
cal wavevector k =
tance 1/k0 becomes larger than |k0|, where k0 is the
wave vector of the atom at a large distance from the
surface. Therefore,

from the surface[6]. The atomic wave is partially
reﬂected at the vicinity of zmax, and the part of the
wave that passes through the peak of φ is acceler-
ated adiabatically and hits the repulsive wall of the
surface. The φ increases indeﬁnitely as the wave
vector k0 or the potential constant Cn approaches

zero, and the reﬂectivity is expected to approach
unity if the normal incident velocity is suﬃciently
low or Cn is suﬃciently small. Since Cn is approxi-
mately proportional to the density of the solid near
the surface, the reﬂectivity should be improved by
decreasing the eﬀective density near the surface.
Motivated by this consideration, we etched the sil-
icon surface to form a grating structure with very
narrow ridges so that the atom interacts with only
a small fraction of the entire surface. We measured
the reﬂectivity of an ultracold neon atomic beam in
the 1s3 metastable state as a function of incident
angle.

An example of the silicon surface used in the ex-
periment is shown in Fig. 1. The grating struc-
ture was formed on the (0,0,1) surface that was
ﬂat within 20 nm, by the following procedure. A
100 nm-thick oxidized layer was formed on the
(0,0,1) surface, then the surface was coated with
a negative resist. The pattern of a periodic array
of stripes that form the top of the ridges was writ-
ten with an electron beam on the resist, and the
oxidized layer was removed photo-lithographically
with buﬀered HF excluding the top of the ridges.
The direction of the ridge was aligned precisely
parallel to the (1,1,0) direction. The silicon was
then etched by tetramethylammonium (TMAH).
The etchant preferentially etched the (0,0,1) sur-
face and left (±1, ∓1, 1) facets on two sides of the
oxidized stripe, forming a roof-shaped ridge. The
etching process was stopped just before the bottom
(0,0,1) facet disappeared, or the top of the ridge
was eroded seriously. The height of the ridge was
between 1.5 and 6 µm. Finally, the oxidized layer
on the ridge was removed with buﬀered HF. The
ﬂatness of the top of the ridge was believed not
to be degraded by the etching process. The size of
the plate was typically 10 mm by 90 mm. The ridge
was formed parallel to the 10 mm side and was per-
pendicular to the atomic beam. We measured the
reﬂectivity of several samples with a periodicity p
between 10 and 100 µm and a width d of the top
of the ridge between 40 nm and 11µm.

The experimental setup was described in our
previous report[1]. Metastable neon atoms in the
1s3 state were generated by optical pumping from
atoms in the 1s5 state trapped in a magneto-optical
trap. The 1s3 atoms were freed from the trap
and fell nearly vertically pulled by gravity. A di-
aphragm with a square hole (1 × 1 mm) was placed

33 cm below the atomic source. The silicon plate
was placed 15 cm further below the diaphragm. Its
surface was placed approximately parallel to a side
of the square hole of the diaphragm. The longitudi-
nal velocity of the atom at the surface was approx-
imately 3 m/s, and its de Broglie wavelength was
7 nm. The entire vertical length of the silicon plate
was illuminated by the atoms that passed through
the square hole. A part of the atomic beam hit the
plate, reﬂected and formed a line image on the mi-
crochannel plate detector (MCP) that was placed
112 cm below the atomic source. A part of the
atomic beam missed the plate and hit the MCP di-
rectly. The intensity of the direct beam was used to
calibrate the absolute reﬂectivity, while the angle of
the reﬂection was calculated from the distance be-
tween the image of the reﬂected atoms and that of
the direct beam. Figure 2 shows a cross-sectional
view of the experimental setup and a typical pat-
tern of atoms on the MCP. The pattern was ob-
tained from the surface that had 1 µm wide ridges
and a periodicity of 100 µm. The strong stripe in
the middle is the image of the specularly reﬂected
atoms. The weak line at the left is the ﬁrst-order
diﬀraction pattern produced by the 100 µm peri-
odic structure.

The reﬂectivity was measured at the normal inci-
dent velocity between 4 and 30 mm/s, which corre-
sponded to the incident angle θ of the atomic beam
measured from the silicon surface between 1.3 and
10 mRad. Figure 3 shows the reﬂectivity of four
diﬀerent samples as a function of normal incident
velocity. For comparison, the curve for a ﬂat sur-
face taken from ref. 1 is shown by a solid line. The
periodicity p and the width d of the four samples
were 100 µm and 11 µm, 100 µm and 1 µm, 30 µm
and 40 nm, and 10 µm and d = 40 nm, respectively.
The one-dimensional wave equation with the
potential −Cn/zn is written in a dimensionless
form if the distance z is normalized by β =
(mCn/¯h)1/(n−2) and the energy by ¯h2/(mβ2).
This means that, for the van der Waals potential
−C3/z3, the reﬂectivity of a ridged surface is equal
to the reﬂectivity of a ﬂat surface at (d/p) times
smaller velocity, if the one-dimensional theory with
C3 replaced by (d/p)C3 is applicable. The actual
improvement in the reﬂectivity is not that spec-
tacular and shows that the two-dimensional wave
equation must be integrated to obtain a quantita-
tive result. However, the general trend in Fig. 3

agrees with this estimate. The reﬂectivity is larger
for a smaller d/p. The slope near θ = 0 for the sam-
ples with d/p ∼ 100 is approximately eight times
8
smaller than that of the ﬂat surface. As a result,
at around the velocity of 30 mm/s corresponding
to the incident angle θ = 10 mRad, the reﬂectivity
was more than 102 times larger than that of a ﬂat
surface . For the sample with a larger periodicity,
the reﬂectivity decreased more rapidly than that
of the ﬂat surface at large θ. This result is eas-
ily understood based on geometrical consideration.
When an atom passes near the top of the ridge, it
must pass within distance zmax in order to be de-
ﬂected and to contribute to the specular reﬂection.
An atom that passes at a larger distance can be
deﬂected at the next ridge only when it does not
hit the side of the ridge. By ignoring the numeri-
cal factor and putting φmax ∼ 1 in Eq. (1), zmax
is roughly given by 1/k0 ≈ λdB/(2πθ), where λdB
is the de Broglie wavelength of the colliding atom.

on the surface condition. Therefore, the quantum
reﬂection is a valuable tool for studying the char-
acteristics of solid surfaces.

Further improvement of the reﬂectivity at a
larger angle will be possible if the width of the
ridge and the periodicity are reduced. The reﬂect-
ing distance zmax decreases as the eﬀective C3 de-
creases and also as k0 increases. The ultimate limit
on the reﬂectivity is determined by the distance at
which the colliding atom is inﬂuenced by interac-
tions other than van der Waals potential. When
the atom approaches too close to the surface, the
interaction potential become ﬂattened by the re-
pulsive core potential and ceases to be suﬃciently
steep to cause reﬂection. A metastable atom can be
inelastically scattered when it touches the electron
on the solid surface. The distance to cause these
phenomena is in the order of nm. Therefore, the
ultimate normal incident velocity or the incident
angle is determined by λdB/(2πθ) ∼ 10nm. For
the metastable neon this gives the normal incident
velocity of 50 cm/s. For a lighter atom such as he-
lium the reﬂectivity should be high at any angles
in principle if the atom is cooled below 100 µK.

As an example of application to atom optical
elements, we fabricated a reﬂective grating on a
silicon surface with a ridged structure. Figure 4
shows the diﬀraction grating with a periodicity of
2 mm. The grating was composed of 1-mm-wide re-
ﬂective stripes each of which was composed of 102
ridges separated by 10 µm. The top of the ridge
was 100 nm wide. At a large diﬀraction angle, the
intensity of the ﬁrst-order diﬀraction relative to the
specular reﬂection was approximately 0.4, which is
in agreement with the intensity ratio of a transmis-
sion grating with a 50% opening. As the incident
angle is reduced, the relative intensity of the ﬁrst-
order diﬀraction becomes weaker, and the eﬃciency
becomes almost constant at a value of 6.5 %. This
is due to the same physics that increases the reﬂec-
tivity of a ridged surface. As the angle decreases,
all atoms become deﬂected even when the spacing
of two successive ridges is as large as 1 mm. There-
fore, the 1-mm-wide ﬂat stripe does not function as
an absorbing surface, and the contrast of the am-
plitude grating is lost. A similar loss of contrast
was observed on the phase grating of an evanescent
wave[7].

In conclusion we have demonstrated that for light
atoms the reﬂectivity of quantum reﬂection can be
suﬃciently increased for use as practical reﬂective
atom optics elements, which enables us to design
simple stable devices. The present result shows

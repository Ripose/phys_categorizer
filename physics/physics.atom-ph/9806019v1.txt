High resolution amplitude and phase gratings in atom optics

(September 23, 2013)

An atom-ﬁeld geometry is chosen in which an atomic beam traverses a ﬁeld interaction zone
consisting of three ﬁelds, one having frequency Ω = c/λ propagating in the ˆz direction and the other
two having frequencies Ω + δ1 and Ω + δ2 propagating in the -ˆz direction. For n1δ1 + n2δ2 = 0 and
|δ1| T, |δ2| T ≫ 1, where n1 and n2 are positive integers and T is the pulse duration in the atomic
rest frame, the atom-ﬁeld interaction results in the creation of atom amplitude and phase gratings
having period λ/[2(n1 + n2)]. In this manner, one can use optical ﬁelds having wavelength λ to
produce atom gratings having periodicity much less than λ.

I. INTRODUCTION

Over the past several years, atom interferometry has
emerged as an important new research area in atomic,
molecular and optical physics [1]. The technology has
improved to the point where it is now possible to control
the center-of-mass motion of atoms using either micro-
fabricated gratings [2] or optical ﬁelds [3]. Accompany-
ing the developments in atom interferometry and atom
optics have been attempts to produce nanostructures us-
ing atom optics elements. Probably the most successful
method to date employs standing wave optical ﬁelds to
focus atoms to a series of lines or dots having size on the
order of tens of nanometers [4]. The period of the struc-
tures produced in these focusing schemes is λ/2, where
λ is the wavelength associated with the standing wave
ﬁelds. Spatial features having dimensions as small as
λ/8 have been achieved by exploiting the ground state
optical potentials for a magnetically degenerate ground
state [5], but the period of the entire pattern remains
equal to λ/2.

We have described previously a method for produc-
ing spatially modulated atomic densities [6]. When an
atomic beam passes through one or more standing wave
optical ﬁelds having wavelength λ, it is possible to use co-
herent transient techniques to create atomic “gratings”
having spatial period equal to λ/(2n), where n is a posi-
tive integer. The atomic gratings arise as a result of the
nonlinear interaction between the atoms and the ﬁelds.
For example, when an atomic beam passes through a res-
onant, standing wave optical ﬁeld, the ﬁeld can create all
even spatial harmonics in the excited and ground state
populations. As a result of spontaneous emission, the
excited state gratings decay back to the ground state;
however, for properly chosen level schemes the ground
state gratings are not completely ”ﬁlled in.” As a con-
sequence, one has long-lived ground state gratings with
which to operate. The fate of these ground state gratings
depends on the collimation of the atomic beam.

If the angular divergence of the atomic beam is θb, the

gratings persist for a distance of order Lb = λ/(2nθb)
following the atom-ﬁeld interaction. For distances larger
than Lb, the gratings wash out quickly as a result of
Doppler dephasing. The grating structure is not lost,
however. If the atoms interact with a second standing
wave ﬁeld, the various spatial harmonics will rephase at
diﬀerent distances following the interaction with the sec-
ond ﬁeld. By a proper choice of optical ﬁeld strengths,
one can create and isolate atomic density patterns that
correspond very closely to pure, higher order spatial har-
monics [6]. The patterns could be deposited on a sub-
strate and used as elements in soft x-ray systems.

One can also use nonresonant optical ﬁelds to interact
with the atoms. In this case, one creates a ground state
phase grating rather than an amplitude grating [7]. If a
highly-collimated atomic beam is used, the phase grating
can focus the atoms to a series of lines having spatial pe-
riod equal to λ/2. For a beam having angular divergence,
echo techniques can be used to rephase and isolate the
various spatial harmonics [6,8].

≥

If the goal of an experiment is to create a pure, higher
order spatial harmonic, it would be helpful to eliminate
the lower order harmonics from the outset. In this paper,
we describe a method in which a single ﬁeld interaction
zone can be used to produce gratings having spatial pe-
riod equal to λ/(2n) where n
2 (see Fig. 1). An atomic
beam passes through an interaction region in which three
ﬁelds act. One of the ﬁelds has frequency Ω and propa-
gates in the ˆz direction, while two additional ﬁelds, each
counterpropagating relative to the ﬁrst ﬁeld, have fre-
quencies Ω + δ1 and Ω + δ2, respectively. A two-photon
process in which a photon of frequency Ω is absorbed and
one of frequency Ω + δ1 or Ω + δ2 is emitted (see Fig. 2a)
produces a contribution to the ground state amplitude
varying as e2ikz, k = 2π/λ. Such two-photon processes
are not resonant, however, and lead to a vanishingly small
second harmonic amplitude if
1 (j = 1, 2), where
T is the pulse duration in the atomic rest frame. On the
other hand, an elementary four-photon process involving
the absorption of two photons of frequency Ω and the
emission of one each of frequency Ω + δ1 and Ω + δ2 is

resonant, provided δ1 =
δ2 (see Fig. 2b). This process
is responsible for the creation of the fourth spatial har-
monic in the ground state amplitude. Thus the geometry
of Fig. 2b can be used to produce a ground state ampli-
tude having spatial period λ/4 provided δ1 =
δ2. With
other choices of δ1 and δ2, one can suppress an arbitrary
number of lower order harmonics and produce a ground
state amplitude having period λ/(2n) where n > 2.

−

The suppression of lower order harmonics has impor-
tant implications for nanolithography. It is shown below
that the ﬁeld amplitudes and detunings can be chosen
such that a single, higher order atomic grating having
period λ/(2n) can be created to a high degree of accu-
racy. Both amplitude and phase gratings can be pro-
duced. Phase gratings can lead to atom focusing into
lines separated by λ/(2n)

gratings represent a pure, higher order spatial harmonic
that can be deposited on a substrate or used directly to
scatter soft x-rays.

≫

Of course, there are other methods for suppressing
lower order spatial harmonics. A coherent beam split-
ter can produce momenta separation of state amplitudes
that are greater than 2~k. As long as these momenta
components are not spatially separated, the atomic beam
contains density matrix elements in which lower order
spatial harmonics are suppressed. Beam splitters based
on higher order Bragg scattering [9] can lead to ground
state densities corresponding very closely to pure, higher
order spatial harmonics. Adiabatic rapid passage [10] can
also lead to very nearly pure, higher order spatial har-
monics, albeit between state amplitudes corresponding
to diﬀerent internal states. Beam splitters based on tri-
angular optical potentials such as magneto-optical beam
splitters [11] and bichromatic beam splitters [12] produce
large momenta separations, but not pure spatial har-
monics. Our approach is most closely related to that of
Yablonovich and Vrijen [13], who use diﬀerent frequency
ﬁelds to increase spatial modulation in two-photon mi-
croscopy. Here we extend and expand their ideas to the
domain of atom optics and atom interferometry.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section II, an
illustrative example is considered in which the second or-
der spatial harmonic is suppressed. Methods for creating
both amplitude and phase gratings are discussed, as are
the eﬀects of spontaneous decay during the pulse. Both
numerical solutions and an approximate analytical solu-
tion is considered in this section. In Sec. III, numerical
solutions are presented for the suppression of harmon-
ics beyond second order. It is shown that high contrast,
amplitude gratings can be created for arbitrary n. A
summary of the results is given in Sec. IV, and the im-
plications for nanolithography are discussed.

II. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE

Many of the features of harmonic suppression can be
illustrated for the ﬁeld geometry of Fig. 1. The atomic
beam propagates in the ˆx direction and the ﬁelds prop-
agate along the z-axis. The total ﬁeld can be written as
E(r, t) = E(z, t)f (x, y), where f (x, y) is a spatial mode
function,

E(z, t) =

and c.c. stands for complex conjugate. Fields 1 and 2

be real, and set δ1 =

In the atomic rest frame these ﬁelds appear as a radia-
tion pulse and the ﬁeld amplitudes become functions of
time. The atoms are modeled as having two levels, 1 and
2, separated in frequency by ω. The problem divides into
two parts, interaction of the atoms with the ﬁelds and
free evolution of the atoms following the ﬁeld interac-
tion. In the main body of the paper we consider only the
ﬁeld interaction region. In the ﬁeld interaction region, all
eﬀects associated with quantization of the atoms’ center-
of-mass motion, as well as any transverse Doppler shifts,
are neglected. In Sec. IV, we will discuss the free evo-
lution of the atoms following their interaction with the
ﬁeld.

The fundamental processes responsible for excitation to
state 2 from state 1 are shown schematically in Fig. 3.
There can be direct, resonant excitation to state 2 by
ﬁeld E0 and three-photon, resonant excitation involv-
ing the absorption of one photon each from ﬁelds E1
and E2 and emission of one photon into ﬁeld E0 (as
noted above, the amplitude modulated ﬁeld used in this
section can be considered as a sum of two ﬁelds hav-
ing frequencies Ω1 = Ω + δ1 and Ω2 = Ω + δ2, with
δ2 ≡

the Rabi frequency χ0 is a shorthand notation for χ0(z, t)
and contains a factor eikz and, similarly, Rabi frequen-
cies χ1 and χ2 contain factors e−ikz. The overall ampli-
tude for the one photon process varies as χ0eikz and as
(χ0χ1χ2)e−3ikz/δ2 for the three-photon processes. The
δ2 factor reﬂects the fact that the two intermediate states
in the three-photon processes are each oﬀ-resonance by
an energy ~δ. In taking the square of the amplitude, one
ﬁnds a spatial modulation at 4kz. As seen in Sec. III, di-
agrams of this type can be used to estimate the required
ﬁeld strengths for suppression of higher order harmonics.
Equation (16) cannot be solved analytically for arbi-
trary pulse envelope functions. On the other hand, it
can be solved analytically if we assume square pulses,

It follows from Eq. (18) [or from Eq. (16)] that the ex-
cited state population immediately after the pulse is a pe-
riodic function of z having period λ/4. The second order
spatial harmonic having period λ/2 has been suppressed,
owing to the large detunings

In Fig. 5, the solutions of the exact equations [Eq.
(4)] for the upper state probability are compared with
those of the coarse-grained equations [Eq.
(16)]. Re-
call that the solutions of the course grained equations
should approach those of the exact equations as the ratio

δ/χ0 increases. This feature is seen clearly in Fig. 5.
The curve having δ/χ0 = 40 correspond to the solution
of both the exact and course-grained equations - they
are not distinguishable for this ratio of δ/χ0. Even for
δ/χ0 = 5, the results do not diﬀer by much. The course
grained equations depend only on the parameters χ0 and
δ/χ1; consequently the solutions of the exact equations
1. If
depend on these two parameters only for δ/χ0 ≫
δ/χ0 . 1, the solution of the exact equations depends in-
dependently on the parameters χ0, δ, and χ1; moreover,
the solution has period λ/2 rather than λ/4. Although
not evident from the ﬁgure, the δ = χ0 results diﬀer from
pure λ/4 periodicity by as much as 10%. These diﬀer-
ences are more evident in Fig. 6, drawn for δ/χ0 = 1/3.
To assure λ/4 periodicity, one must have δ/χ0 & 5.

In Fig. 7, the upper state probability is plotted as a
function of kz for ﬁxed χ1/δ = 5/6, and several values of
χ0. These curves follow the same qualitative behavior as
those shown in Fig. 4 for the square pulse. In Fig. 8, the
upper state probability is plotted as a function of kz for
ﬁxed χ0 = π and several values of χ1/δ. For χ1/δ . 0.5,
the grating contrast is less than unity, but the grating is
very nearly pure fourth harmonic. With increasing χ1/δ,
the grating contrast approaches unity and harmonics of
1, are evident.

When ∆ > 1, the elementary processes shown in Fig. 3
are no longer resonant. Thus one expects that the excited
state population following the pulse to be negligible. On
the other hand the resonant, elementary 4-photon pro-
cesses, shown in Fig. 9, lead to a modiﬁcation of the
phase of the ground state amplitude. To calculate the
phase change of the ground state amplitude, it is con-
venient to use the semiclassical dressed states associated
with Eq. (16). These states are obtained by instanta-

C. Role of Spontaneous Emission

So far we have neglected the role of spontaneous emis-
sion during the excitation pulse. To investigate the role of
spontaneous emission during the pulse, we adopt a highly
simpliﬁed decay scheme in which state 2 decays to a state
outside the two-state manifold with rate 2γ. As a result,
population leaks out of the two-level manifold. Clearly,
any excited state amplitude grating will be diminished
by decay. It also turns out that phase gratings are de-
stroyed by spontaneous decay since the excited state pop-
ulation during the pulse is not negligible under conditions
favoring a signiﬁcant spatially modulated phase grating.
Spontaneous emission breaks the adiabatic following that
would return the atom to its ground state in the absence
of such decay [14].

Within the context of this model, spontaneous emis-
sion can be included in Eq. (4) by the addition of a term

spontaneous emission destroys grating formation when
γ & 1. This is easily understood. To have strong spa-
tial modulation of amplitude or phase gratings, there is
always a signiﬁcant excited state population during the
pulse; any decay results in a loss of population from the
system in our simple decay scheme.

We have also carried out density matrix calculations
using various decay schemes. It appears that one must
require γ . 0.5 to retain reasonable grating contrast.

III. SUPPRESSION OF HIGHER ORDER
HARMONICS

One can generalize the previous results to allow for the
suppression of harmonics higher than second order. The
appropriate ﬁeld geometry is shown in Fig. 1. Sponta-
neous emission during the atom-pulse interaction is ne-
glected. For the ﬁeld (1), the state amplitudes evolve
as

˙a =

iF(z, t)a

Since H(z, t) cannot be factored as a constant matrix
times a function of t, the method used in Sec. II is not
applicable. On the other hand it is not diﬃcult to obtain
numerical solutions of Eq. (25).

Diagrams similar to those shown in Figs. 3 and 9 can
help us to estimate the ﬁeld strengths needed to obtain
both amplitude and phase gratings. Before considering
such diagrams, we note that the lowest order ac Stark

it is important to choose the Rabi frequencies such that
Eq. (27) is satisﬁed. Higher order contributions to the

small as λ/10 can be produced with contrast of order
unity. For suﬃciently large δ, an arbitrary number of
lower order harmonics can be suppressed.

IV. DISCUSSION

It has been shown that atom-ﬁeld interactions can
be used to create high contrast amplitude gratings for
atomic state populations and phase gratings for atomic

having wavelength λ are used, it is possible to choose
atom-ﬁeld detunings such that the lowest spatial har-
monic component in the gratings has period λ/2n, where
n is an integer. For the sake of deﬁniteness, we will refer
to the harmonic having period λ/2n as the (2n)th har-
monic. The gratings produced are not pure in the sense
that they contain all integer multiples of the (2n)th har-
monic, but the ﬁeld strengths can be chosen in such a
manner as to maximize the contribution from the (2n)th
harmonic. Once the gratings are created, the question
remains as how to image the gratings at some distance
L from the atom-ﬁeld interaction zone. One can probe
the gratings by applying counterpropagating ﬁelds hav-
ing frequencies Ω and Ω+δ1 to generate a signal with fre-
quency Ω + δ2; alternatively, one can deposit the atomic
density grating on a substrate. The situation is diﬀerent
for amplitude and phase gratings.

≪

In the case of amplitude gratings, one has the op-
tion of working with distances L that correspond to ei-
ther classical or quantum-mechanical scattering for the
atoms. If L & LT , where the so-called Talbot length LT
is deﬁned by LT = 2(λ/2n)2/λdB (λdB is the atomic de
Broglie wavelength), the atomic center-of-mass motion
for the atoms must be treated quantum mechanically;
LT , this motion can be treated classically. Typ-
for L
ically, LT is of order of a few cm for a thermal beam. We
restrict our discussion to the classical scattering limit.
For classical scattering, the total atomic density is not
modulated, as long as no state-selective mechanism re-
moves atoms from the system. In other words, the ex-
cited and ground state population can be modulated fol-
lowing interaction with the ﬁelds, but the sum of these
populations is not modiﬁed. If the excited state popu-
lation decays to the ground state following interaction
with the ﬁeld, the grating structure disappears. There
are several methods to maintain the gratings following
the atom-ﬁeld interaction. The most direct method is to
use optical transitions, such as those in Ca, Mg, or Yb,
with lifetimes approaching a microsecond or longer. One
can then probe the population diﬀerence grating follow-
ing the atom-ﬁeld interaction or selectively ionize excited
state atoms to leave a net atomic density grating that
could be deposited on a substrate.

For shorter-lived atomic transitions, there are several
alternatives. One possibility is to ionize some of the ex-

6

cited state atoms during the atom-ﬁeld interaction, which
would leave a net atomic density grating. Another pos-
sibility is to use atoms whose ground state consists of a
manifold of substates. When the excited state decays,
the total ground state density is not modulated, but that
of speciﬁc substates may be modulated. By selectively
ionizing some of the ground state sublevels, one again
achieves a net atomic density grating. Still another al-
ternative is to use a beam of metastable atoms and drive
transitions between the metastable state and an excited
state that can decay back to the ground state [15]. Fol-
lowing the atom-ﬁeld interaction, there will be a grating
of metastable atoms that can be detected selectively.

In the case of shorter-lived excited states, one can run
into problems related to the eﬀective pulse interaction
time T which corresponds to the transit time of the atoms
through the ﬁeld interaction zone. Recall that all fre-
quencies are measured in units of T −1. For appreciable
gratings, it is necessary that γT . 0.5. If the ﬁelds are
focused to a spot size of 10 µ and the longitudinal atomic
speed is 5
20 ns. For these param-
eters, one must use atoms whose excited state lifetime
exceeds 20 ns. It is also possible to limit the atom-ﬁeld
interaction time by using pulsed ﬁelds. For transit times
of order 20 ns, the detunings and Rabi ﬁeld strengths
considered in this paper correspond to frequencies in the
MHz to GHz range. Such values do not pose any serious
experimental diﬃculties.

Assuming that we can produce a density grating, many
methods are available for imaging the gratings. Perhaps
the most direct method is to detect the grating immedi-
ately following the atom-ﬁeld interaction. This scheme is
analogous to free-induction decay (FID) in coherent tran-
sient spectroscopy. All harmonics in the beam are super-
imposed, and the grating begins to wash out as a result of
the transverse Doppler eﬀect at distances Lb = λ/(2nθb),
where θb is the atomic beam divergence. To avoid overlap
of the diﬀerent harmonic components, echo techniques
can be used [16]. With two interaction zones separated
by a distance L0, diﬀerent harmonics are focused at dif-
ferent distances following the second interaction zone.
For example, one can optimize the (2n)th harmonic at
L = 2L0, the (4n)th harmonic at L = 3L0/2, the (6n)th
harmonic at L = 4L0/3, etc. In this manner one is able
to isolate and focus harmonics higher than 2n which were
created in the ﬁrst ﬁeld interaction zone [6]. For exam-
ple, one could create 4th harmonic in the ﬁrst interaction
zone and 16th harmonic in the second interaction zone
to optimize the 12th harmonic at L = 4L0/3.

Although FID and echo techniques can be used also
for phase gratings [8], we consider here only the focusing
capabilities of phase gratings. The phase grating can be
thought to arise as the result of an ac Stark shift poten-
tial that acts as a spatially modulated index of refraction
for the atoms and causes them to focus at a distance of
order LT /A, where A is some eﬀective pulse area in the

problem associated with the creation of the (2n)th har-
monic. In this manner, one can focus an atomic beam
to a series of lines (or dots if a 2-D geometry is utilized)
having spacing λ/2n.

In summary, we have outlined methods for generating
and detecting spatially modulated atomic density ampli-
tude or phase gratings having period λ/2n using optical
ﬁelds having wavelength λ. All harmonics having larger
periods are suppressed by a proper choice of atom-ﬁeld
detunings.

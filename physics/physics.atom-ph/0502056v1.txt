Abstract. – We describe the statistical mechanics of a new method to produce very cold
atoms or molecules. The method results from trapping a gas in a potential well, and sweeping
through the well a semi-permeable barrier, one that allows particles to leave but not to return.
If the sweep is suﬃciently slow, all the particles trapped in the well compress into an arbitrarily
cold gas. We derive analytical expressions for the velocity distribution of particles in the cold
gas, and compare these results with numerical simulations.

Introduction. – Evaporative cooling was originally suggested as a means to achieve Bose-

alkali atoms [4,5] culminated in the ﬁrst observation of Bose–Einstein condensation in atomic
vapors [6–8]. Since then it has been the essential process by which to obtain degenerate
quantum gases. Nevertheless it has shortcomings. The main two are

1. Almost all atoms originally trapped to produce the condensate are lost during the evap-

oration process.

2. The time scale for collisions leading to thermal equilibrium can be short compared to

the time employed to form the condensate.

The latter shortcoming is especially severe for fermionic atoms, since for two fermions in the
same state, s-wave scattering is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle. Currently, degen-
erate fermionic gases can only be obtained by a combination of evaporative and sympathetic
cooling [9] in the presence of bosonic atoms or diﬀerent states of the fermionic atoms [10].

Recently, procedures to construct semi-permeable barriers for ultra–cold atoms have been
suggested [11, 12]. Such barriers transmit atoms coming from one side and reﬂect them from

principle these barriers may be constructed for many diﬀerent atoms and molecules. We have
shown that by placing such a wall into a box-shaped potential one may achieve a substantial
increase in phase space density [11], or equivalently, substantial cooling.

Fig. 1 – Schematic view of the optical compressor. Particles begin in region A with characteristic
energies kBT . Particles arriving at the semi–permeable barrier from the right travel through it, while
those in region B arriving from the left are reﬂected. The semi–permeable barrier moves to the right
at speed u = ˙xb, transferring particles from region A to region B, where their maximum kinetic energy
is much less.

Our goal in this letter is to demonstrate that by slowly sweeping a semi–permeable wall
through a general trapping potential, the particles naturally compress into a state of very low
energy. The basic idea is illustrated in Figure 1. At any given time, all particles remaining
in region A to the right of the potential have energy less than V (xb). When the wall moves
slightly to the right, the particles that reach it are at their turning point, and have very small
kinetic energy. As the semi–permeable barrier continues to move to the right, one might think
that particles on the left in region B gain back their energy. However, for a convex potential,
as the particles bounce oﬀ the moving wall, they lose more energy in the collision than they
gain otherwise. In this way, a slow sweep of the semi–permeable barrier through the convex
well reduces particle energies to very low values set by the speed of the sweep.

The conditions needed for this optical compressor to work are quite diﬀerent from those
required for the eﬀectiveness of evaporative cooling. The optical compressor tolerates the
existence of a nonequilibrium distribution of particles to the right of the wall. In particular,
the velocities of particles that reach the semi–permeable barrier from the right are all very
low, rather than being given by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution that would describe
them in equilibrium. Thus the process of compression may be fast compared to the thermal
equilibration time of the particles. On the other hand, the sweep of the wall cannot occur
too quickly, because the kinetic energy of particles after they traverse the wall is given by a
positive power of the wall velocity.

Thus, the optical compressor provides a process completely complementary to evaporative

cooling:

1. No atoms are lost during the compression process.

2. The time scale for collisions leading to thermal equilibrium must be long compared to

the time spent sweeping the semi–permeable barrier.

We note that as the equilibration time becomes comparable to the time of the sweep, phase
space compression will occur due to combination of evaporative cooling in region A and the
process discussed here.

Model. – We consider an ideal collisionless gas trapped in a one-dimensional potential
V (x); two other dimensions are either untrapped or conﬁned in a box-shaped potential. The

gas is originally in thermal equilibrium at temperature T = 1/kBβ. An ideal inﬁnitely thin
semi–permeable barrier is located at position xb, which is originally far to the left of any
particles. The barrier moves to the right with velocity u = ˙xb, its intersection point with the
well moving from E1 to E0 and eventually passing through the whole well and out the right
hand side.

In the limit of slow wall velocities it is possible to obtain analytical results. We ﬁrst focus
on the distribution of velocities with which particles cross the barrier, and then consider the
question of how their velocities change after they have crossed the barrier.

Particles with energy E are not aﬀected by the wall until the wall reaches the point where
(E). We

V (xb) = E. Let the period of oscillation of a particle of energy E in region A be
assume that there are

particles near energy E, and that their positions in the trap are random. Therefore, from the
time the ﬁrst particle of this energy passes through the barrier, until the last one leaves, there
passes a time
(E). The last particle to be captured is one that had just passed the turning
point and was headed to the right as the barrier reached energy E. Particles of energy E will
pass at a uniform rate through the barrier during the time interval
(E). The ﬁrst particle
to pass the barrier will have no kinetic energy, while the last one through will have kinetic
energy

Here ˙E gives the rate at which the intersection point of the barrier with the potential well
decreases in energy per time. We are using here the assumption that motion of the semi–
permeable barrier through the well is fast compared to the thermal equilibration time, or else
the kinetic energies of particles escaping the trap would be described by a Maxwell–Boltzmann
distribution with temperature T . We note that even if the semi–permeable barrier moved so
slowly through the trap that thermal equilibrium obtained in region A, there would still be
some cooling in region B, as we now describe.

Once particles have passed the semi–permeable barrier, they collide repeatedly with the
barrier as it moves to the right and reﬂect from it. They lose energy to the barrier in this
process. The ﬁnal energy of each particle can be determined by observing that the process is
pdq is conserved [13]. Consider
adiabatic in the sense of mechanics, so that the action I =
a particle that has kinetic energy K and total energy E as it passes through the barrier. If
the kinetic energy K is not too large, the potential in region B can be treated as linear, and
one computes that the particle has action

where m is the particle mass, and V ′ is the slope of the potential. As the wall continues to
move to the right, this action is preserved, allowing one to determine the ﬁnal energy e of the
particle once the barrier has swept all the way through the trap. We deﬁne in particular the

Here θ is a Heaviside step function. This expression follows by noting that the n(E)dE
particles with potential energy E cross the barrier with kinetic energies K evenly distributed
between 0 and ˙E
. The energies E0 and E1 are the minimum and maximum intersection
points of the semi–permeable barrier with the potential well, as indicated in Figure 1. The
factor dK/de accounts for changes in the energy distribution of particles due to adiabatic
expansion in region B.

T

The distribution f (e) in Eq. (5) does not describe thermal equilibrium. Once the com-
pression process has terminated, we expect that the gas will be maintained for times long
compared with the thermal equilibration time. The total energy of particles in the trap will
be conserved in this process. Thus the end result will be a thermal distribution of particles
with average energy ¯ef = E/N and temperature Tf that may be found from the system of
three equations with three unknowns (entropy S, free energy F , and temperture T ) [14]:

We performed numerical simulations of the process by randomly preparing particles with
various energies in gravitational and harmonic potentials. We solved the equations of motion
while moving a semi–permeable barrier slowly through the potential. This procedure was
repeated for N particles with average energy corresponding to the temperature. The results
of these simulation are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. They are in good agreement with the analytical
formulas for small velocities.

Comparisons and limitations. – Because the one-way wall for an atomic barrier relies
upon diﬀerent internal states, it truly diminishes the system entropy as a Maxwell demon
would, except for the unavoidable heating due to recoil of a photon motion. This can be
captured as the cooling eﬀect as described in this paper. By comparison, in a plasma, where
analogous one-way walls were proposed in the radio frequency regime [17], there is no opportu-
nity to change internal states of the plasma ions. Instead, the one-way ponderomotive-eﬀect
wall operates through Hamiltonian forces only, thereby conserving phase space. Thus for
plasmas, no matter how the wall is moved, no real cooling can take place.
In the end, if
the plasma ions occupy the same volume in space, they would of necessity occupy the same
volume in velocity space – and hence not achieve a cooling eﬀect. Note, however, that while
the one-way radio-frequency wall does not cool plasma, it can force ions or electrons to move
in one direction only. Thus, plasma currents can be driven by plasma waves, which can be
useful for a variety of plasma applications [18].

The limitation of the semi-permeable wall we suggested [11] is that it results in heating
of atoms to a single photon recoil mvr = ¯hkL. As the wall velocity diminishes, the process
becomes ineﬃcient. If the temperature of the gas is originally nr recoils; i.e. kBT = n2
rEr
where Er = ¯h2k2
L/2/m, then assuming that the ﬁnal energy is Er we ﬁnd the slowest velocity
with which it is still advantageous to move the wall in case of the parabolic trap is

(19)

(20)

(21)

In particular, if we start with a temperature of 10 recoils, the minimum wall velocity comes
out to be u = 0.05vr. If velocity relaxation happens on time scale τ , the size of the trap can
then be uτ . For alkalies, τ can be as long as tens of seconds; hence in this case the size of the
cloud is on the order of centimeters.

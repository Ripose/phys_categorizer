Abstract

The proton structure eﬀects, including ﬁnite size, polarizability and self–
energy is considered and their inﬂuence on energy levels of muonic hydrogen
is recalculated. A new theoretical prediction for the Lamb shift is presented
together with improved values of all known QED contributions.

The precision tests of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in atomic systems have reached
the level, where nuclear structure eﬀects become signiﬁcant. Moreover, the lack of accurate
data on low energy structure functions of the nucleus strongly limits theoretical predictions.
The well known example is the hydrogen hyperﬁne structure splitting, where measurement is
6 orders of magnitude more precise than the current theoretical predictions. Other example
is the Lamb shift in hydrogen, where inaccuracy in the proton charge radius dominate other
theoretical uncertainties. Since many years it was the motivation to study the pure QED
systems like muonium and positronium, where strong interaction eﬀects are negligible or well
estimated at the precision level of interest. A new possibilities in the improvement of QED
test on bound systems appeared with the project of measurement of the Lamb shift in muonic
hydrogen [1]. Being bound in the ground state, muon with its 200 heavier mass compared
to the electron, penetrates the proton and become sensitive to the distribution of charge,
magnetic moment or the polarizability. The main goal of the measurement of the Lamb
shift in muonic hydrogen is a precise determination of mean square proton charge radius.
It will verify older measurements of proton charge radius based on the elastic electron–
proton scattering. The results of these experiments had to be extrapolated to very low
q2 = 0 momentum transfer, and therefore might be not very reliable.
In contrast the
muonic Lamb shift measurement aims to improve the precision of the proton charge radius
by at least 10 times. However it would require the calculation of all other contributions
with the comparable or better precision. Few years ago, in the summary of all known up
to date QED eﬀects on muonic hydrogen energy levels [2], we concluded that three–loop
vacuum polarization have limited the precision of theoretical predictions by 0.01 meV, and
pointed attention to the proton polarizability eﬀect, which was not calculated that time.
The progress on the experimental side with the preparation of the measurement of muonic
hydrogen Lamb shift has stimulated further theoretical works. The rather diﬃcult three–
loop vacuum polarization contribution has recently been calculated by Kinoshita and Nio
[3] with the result

A new contribution coming from hadronic vacuum polarization has been studied by Friar
and collaborators [4], who obtained the following result

The proton polarizability correction has been analyzed by Rosenfelder in [5]. His estimate
for this eﬀect is

0.018 meV. The calculation of proton
Another recent work [6] gives a similar result of
polarizability eﬀect is aﬀected by the lack of precise data on low–energy proton structure
functions. In this paper we present another estimate of this eﬀect together with the complete
review of all other proton structure contributions. We would like to emphasize the impor-
tance of the proton self–energy eﬀect and the related problem with the meaning of mean
square charge radius. In other words we present the relation of charge radius as obtained
from atomic spectroscopy measurements with that based on the electron scattering data.

which gives
fm from [7]. From this one concludes, that the measurement of muonic hydrogen with the
precision of 0.01 meV will lead to the tenfold improvement in the proton charge radius. This
formula in (4) accounts for most of the proton structure eﬀects. Any correction beyond that
is much smaller and usually neglected for light (electronic) atoms. It is our aim to review
them in the context of muonic hydrogen Lamb shift.

Since the leading contribution to the 2P-2S splitting comes from the electron vacuum
polarization (e.v.p.), the second order corrections from combined ﬁnite size and e.v.p. eﬀects
are nonnegligible. They have been calculated in [8], here we present a little more accurate
result

Further corrections are due to pure photon exchange terms only. The O(m α5) correction
is given by two–photon scattering amplitude with external momenta on mass shell, see Eq.
(7).
It is the main contribution, which we analyze in this work. However, lets consider
ﬁrst the small corrections beyond this two–photon exchange approximation, namely that
of order m α6. Since they are small, it is suﬃcient to calculate them in the external ﬁeld
approximation, or in other words in the limit of inﬁnite nucleus mass. The energy levels are
obtained then from the Dirac equation in the potential of the ﬁnite size nucleus. They have
been considered in details by Friar in [9]. In the logarithmic approximation they are given
by two terms

Since it changes the analytic behavior of T1 and T2 at small p2
proton self–energy could be only partially accounted for in the proton formfactors, as a
contribution to anomalous magnetic moment or the charge radius. Since, in our opinion
this problem is not generally known, we repeat here the analysis from our former paper on
radiative recoil corrections and correct some minor missprints.

For a true proton there is a ﬁnite size correction as given by Eq. (4). The problem is that
the proton self-energy is modiﬁed by and modiﬁes as well, the ﬁnite size eﬀect. Therefore
some corrections might be counted twice. To incorporate the correction (14) unambiguously
we must precisely specify what is the nuclear mean square charge radius. Its usual deﬁnition
through the Sachs formfactor

is not correct at our precision level, because the radiative correction to GE is infrared
divergent or depend on spurious photon mass. Following [2] we propose thus a diﬀerent
deﬁnition using the forward scattering amplitude described by T µν, or more precisely by its
longitudinal component TL deﬁned by

The small second term in the above Eq. gives
the proton self–energy contributes only through Bethe log. The correction to anomalous
magnetic moment is already taken into account in the calculation of relativistic eﬀects as
given by the Breit Hamiltonian.

We now return to the forward scattering amplitude and its associated correction to energy
of µH. We can neglects here QED eﬀects on the structure functions, since they are α times
smaller. Otherwise dispersion relations for T1 and T2 as in Eq. (29,30) will not be correct.
After neglection of QED eﬀects one can expect a separated pole at 2Mν = q2, that is due
to the elastic contribution. It is obtained with the help of the proton elastic formfactors F1
and F2, see Eq. (18). One derives for T1 and T2 the following expressions

Any contribution in the two photon exchange beyond this second order Born term is con-
sidered to be due to the proton polarizability. The correction to energy as given by Eq.
(7) shows infrared singularity, which is due to the ﬁnite size eﬀect, already accounted for at
the lower order in α. One ﬁrst subtracts this singularity and then integrate over q. With
the commonly used dipole parametrization of proton formfactors and Λ2 = 0.71 GeV2 one
obtains ∆E = 0.018 meV. However, as pointed out in [1] this result is not correct, because
this dipole parametrization corresponds to the proton radius r = 0.81 fm, which diﬀers
signiﬁcantly from the value r = 0.862 fm. Instead, we use the parametrization by Simon et
al. [7] with the result

∆E = 0.0232(15) meV = r3 0.0281 .

(25)

This parametrization in [7] is not correct for Q2
1 GeV or greater since for large
Q2 it behaves like Q−2 not Q−4, however it does not inﬂuence the result at the presented
precision level. This r3 dependence in Eq. (25) is only an approximate dependence. This
dependence become exact in the large nucleus mass limit with the dipole parametrization
of proton formfactors. The result 0.0232(15) was obtained assuming r = 0.862(12) fm. If
the proton radius r from µH measurement will be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, this result should
be adjusted with the improved parametrization of proton formfactors.

The ﬁrst dominant part could be well calculated, while the calculation of the smaller second
part will require additional assumptions. This second part was usually neglected in studies
of polarizability eﬀect in composite nuclei, see for example [11]. The imaginary part of Ti
in variable ν at ﬁxed q2 is obtained from the inclusive cross section γ∗ + p

where νth is the threshold value of ν for the production of π mesons. This formulas are
1/2, due to the diﬀerent deﬁnition
obtained from [12], by multiplying right hand side by
of Ti in our work. While W2 for proton behaves like 1/ν to large ν, W1 goes like ν, and thus
the dispersion relation in (30) contains a subtraction at ν = 0. We have assumed here, that
T2 has similar asymptotic behavior as W2. i.e. vanishes in the large ν limit. However, there
is no too much information on T1(0, q2). One recognizes that in the limit of small q2 it is

and R is equal to R = WL(ν, q2)/W1(ν, q2) = σL/σT , the ratio of longitudinal to transverse
cross sections, and thus could be measured. A recent work [14] by E143 collaborations brings
the most recent parametrization of R in the momentum range Q2
1 GeV. What we ﬁnd,
is a weak dependence of R on ν for small Q2, of order few GeV, see for example Figure 3 of
this work. Moreover R is between 0.3
0.4. However there is no precise data on the most
Q2 at
important region for us of Q2 < 1 GeV. One knows from conditions (12,13), that R
small Q2 and constant ν. The only known paper by Brasse et. al [15] brings comments on
R, that it is of order 10% at the resonance region. Since, what we ﬁnd later on, E2 is small
and we do not have precise data on R at the resonance region we simply neglect R in the
expression for E2 in (34). We expect, this approximation will not alter signiﬁcantly the ﬁnal
result for the polarizability correction. Various parametrization of structure functions W2
were presented in the literature. We have chosen that, which match the q2 = 0 limit known
as a photoproduction and are correct for region of ν and Q2 of order few GeV. We use the
parametrization from [15] for the resonance region. It is given by a compact formula and a
long table of numbers, see Table 1 of [15]. For ν close to the threshold for γ∗ + p+

in [15]. The photoproduction of π0 could be neglected close to this threshold value. Out of
the resonance region, W > 1.990 GeV, we use an ALLM97 parametrization with the recent
corrections [16]. With these parametrizations integrals in (33,34) are performed numerically

where the uncertainty of 0.33 forms 20% of ﬁnal result and is an estimate due to approxi-
mations and assumptions performed during this derivation, namely: unknown R, unknown
Q2 dependence of βM and inaccuracy of ALLM97 parametrization at low Q2 and ν. The
contribution to the (2P-2S) splitting of n = 2 states is

EP OL = 0.012(2) meV .

(39)

It is slightly lower than the result obtained by Rosenfelder in [5]. We think it is due to
approximate treatment of the Q-dependence in his work. Other contributions to the Lamb
shift in muonic hydrogen are presented in the Table I. It is an improved version of the former
Table I in [8]. All QED corrections are recalculated with a better precision. The ﬁnal result
for the Lamb shift diﬀers from that in [8] by more than the error estimate there. It is due
to the mistake in the sum in Table I in [8] and due to the inclusion of new terms: proton
polarizability, third order electron v.p. and the hadronic v.p. It should be noted here that
the same eﬀects should be included in hydrogenic Lamb shift, when having a new value
of the proton charge radius.
It was not necessary so far since in the electron scattering
measurements of proton radius, these eﬀects have not been excluded. The uncertainty in
the ﬁnal result has two main sources: the proton polarizability and the estimate of higher
order QED eﬀects. While the ﬁrst one is pretty diﬃcult to improve, the second source
of uncertainty, higher order QED corrections could be well calculated. By these higher
corrections we mean diagrams presented on Figure 1. Diagrams in the second raw, have
been calculated in an approximate way in [8] and are named in the Table I as a muon
self–energy with electron v.p. Some further theoretical work is necessary for obtaining the
improved value of the hyperﬁne splitting of S-levels, since the proton polarizability eﬀect is
also present there. In summary, having now precise theoretical predictions, the measurement
of the 2P-2S transition frequency in the muonic hydrogen will lead to the improved value of
the proton charge radius.

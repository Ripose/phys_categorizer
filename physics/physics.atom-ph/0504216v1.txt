Abstract
We report an observation of the weak 61S0-63P0 transition in 171,173Yb as an important step to

establish Yb as a primary candidate for future optical frequency standards, and to open up a new
approach for qubits using the 1S0 and 3P0 states of Yb atoms in an optical lattice.

Optical clocks show great promise as the next generation of precision frequency standards

due to the high frequency and correspondingly high line-Q of weakly allowed atomic tran-

sitions. Thanks to femtosecond comb technology [1], clocks based on optical transitions in

both single trapped ions and neutral atom clouds are poised to exceed the already very high

precision set by microwave frequency standards [2]. A recent proposal combining the Lamb-

Dicke conﬁnement of single ion frequency standards with the high signal-to-noise of neutral

atom clouds, and exploiting a highly forbidden transition insensitive to external magnetic

ﬁelds and trap light polarization has the potential to do even better [3]. The scheme makes
use of the 1S0-3P0 electric dipole transition in alkaline-earth atoms, weakly allowed in odd

isotopes by the hyperﬁne interaction of the nuclear spin and completely forbidden by a

single-photon process in even isotopes. Trapping the atoms in a Stark-free optical lattice

will allow a large ensemble of atoms to exhibit a spectrum free of Doppler and recoil shifts,
leading to an estimated accuracy of a few parts in 1018 [4, 5]. As an additional applica-
tion, the near absence of decoherence between the 1S0 and 3P0 states suggests forming a

qubit from these states and creating an optical lattice array of such qubits for quantum

information [6, 7].

Yb and Sr are both strong candidates for an optical lattice clock as well as for creating

useful qubits. Both atoms have experimentally accessible optical transitions, allowing the

atoms to be readily laser-cooled and trapped, and in the case of Yb, Bose-Einstein condensed

[8]. While the Sr clock transition has been studied extensively, both in and out of an optical

lattice [9, 10], the same transition in Yb has thus far remained unexplored experimentally.

In this paper, we focus on the odd isotopes of Yb [12]. Here we report the direct excitation
of the 578 nm 1S0−3P0 transition in the odd isotopes 171,173Yb [11]. We also discuss the

possible application of this type of transition in making qubits for quantum computation.

The level structure of Yb is shown in Fig. 1. The experiment is performed on a sample
of cold atoms collected in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the strong 1S0−1P1

transition at 399 nm. To excite the clock transition, we irradiate the cloud of atoms with

a 578 nm probe, continuously monitoring 399 nm ﬂuorescence from the atom cloud. As the

probe laser frequency is scanned over the clock transition, there is an observable decrease in
MOT ﬂuorescence as atoms are excited into the metastable 3P0 state and escape the trap.

The experimental apparatus is diagrammed in Fig. 2. The 399 nm transition is used to
decelerate an atomic beam in a Zeeman slower and then capture either 171Yb or 173Yb in

899-21) is locked to the atomic resonance with an adjustable detuning to prevent slow

frequency drift. Further details of the MOT and Zeeman slower are discussed elsewhere [13].

We probe the clock transition with a ring dye laser (Coherent 899-21) internally locked

to a temperature stabilized Fabry-Perot cavity. A small fraction of the laser’s output is

directed through an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) to an iodine saturated-absorption cell

serving as a frequency reference. The main dye laser output is directed onto the MOT and

its frequency continuously scanned from iodine line 1852 through the Yb clock resonance.

The MOT beams are chopped on and oﬀ at a rate of 2.5 kHz. Resonance data are taken

either with the probe beam on continuously or with the probe and MOT beams chopped

out of phase with each other. The latter procedure should completely avoid the shifts and

broadening of the clock transition due to near-resonant 399 nm light while maintaining a

steady-state MOT population. The MOT magnetic ﬁelds produce a negligible perturbation
on the clock resonance because of the small g-factors of the 1S0 and 3P0 states [5].

The resonant absorption cross-section for the λ = 578 nm photons may be written σ =
(pln2/πλ2/2)(Γ/∆ω) for the case of a Gaussian line shape, where ∆ω is the full width at half

Doppler broadening of about 1MHz at a MOT temperature of 1mK, the value of R is close

to unity. Thus, by contrast with a similar method in Sr [9], we both expect and observe

large fractional reduction in MOT ﬂuorescence at the clock resonance.

The large MOT ﬂuorescence reduction due to the clock resonance in 171Yb is shown

in Fig. 3 (a). Here the resonance data are taken with the probe beam on continuously,

and are subject to extra broadening of the clock transition in the presence of the MOT

light. Data taken with the MOT and probe beams alternately chopped show similarly large

resonances with widths comparable to the independently measured probe laser linewidth.

Further study is required to understand and quantify the diﬀerent sources of broadening in

all our resonance data. The probe laser frequency is given by the detuning from a speciﬁc

hyperﬁne resonance of the iodine line 1852[14], shown in Fig. 3 (b). A similar ﬂuorescence
reduction is also observed in the case of 173Yb. The two clock transitions in 171Yb and 173Yb

are approximately 2.6 and 3.9 GHz below the lowest frequency hyperﬁne component of the

iodine line 1852.

Qubits, as basic elements in quantum computation, are extensively investigated in order

to break through the limit of classical computers. Decoherence of atomic qubits, often caused

by external magnetic ﬁelds and collisions, is generally believed to be the largest obstacle in

the way of building quantum computers. Atom collisions can be reduced by trapping atoms

in optical lattices and keeping low densities, and in fact methods for entangling qubits in

lattices have been proposed [6, 7]. However, magnetic ﬁeld perturbations can be diﬃcult and

inconvenient to eliminate in experiments. Alkaline-earth atoms show intrinsic advantages
in forming qubits in this respect because their metastable 3P0 states and the 1S0 ground

states are insensitive to external magnetic ﬁelds. These states have negligible decoherence

but reasonably large single-photon transition strengths, as shown by the large fractional

ﬂuorescence reduction even with the relatively broad linewidth in Fig. 3 (a). Thus, a qubit
formed by a 1S0 ground state and a metastable 3P0 state can simply be ﬂipped by a single-

photon transition instead of more complicated two-photon Raman transitions as for alkali

atoms [6, 7].

In conclusion, we have observed the weak 1S0-3P0 clock transition in cold 171,173Yb, which

is an important step to establish Yb as one of the primary candidates for future optical

frequency standards, and we have also discussed a new approach for qubits with this single-

photon transition.

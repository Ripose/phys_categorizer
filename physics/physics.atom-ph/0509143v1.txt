Abstract

Quantum electrodynamics has been the ﬁrst theory to emerge from the ideas of regulariza-
tion and renormalization, and the coupling of the fermions to the virtual excitations of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. Today, bound-state quantum electrodynamics provides us with ac-
curate theoretical predictions for the transition energies relevant to simple atomic systems,
and steady theoretical progress relies on advances in calculational techniques, as well as
numerical algorithms. In this brief review, we discuss one particular aspect connected with
the recent progress: the evaluation of relativistic corrections to the one-loop bound-state
self-energy in a hydrogenlike ion of low nuclear charge number, for excited non-S states,
up to the order of α (Zα)6 in units of the electron mass. A few details of calculations for-
merly reported in the literature are discussed, and results for 6F, 7F, 6G and 7G states are
given.

1 Introduction

The bound-state self-energy of an electron in a hydrogenlike atom has been one of the key theo-
retical and experimental cornerstones in the development of modern ﬁeld theory. During the last
decade, the techniques available for calculations have dramatically advanced, and the accuracy
of today’s predictions is several orders of magnitude better than in the early days of quantum
electrodynamics (QED). The advances would be impossible without the combined theoretical
efforts toward the description of the hydrogen spectrum, which have involved generations of
physicists. The aim of the current brief review is threefold: ﬁrst, to give an overview of some
recent advances in Lamb shift calculations and self-energy calculations in particular, second,
to describe a few details of recent calculations, for higher excited non–S states, which may be
useful in an independent recalculation of the higher-order binding corrections, and third, to sup-
plement previously available data for higher-order corrections by results for 6F, 7F, 6G and 7G
states.

In “usual” calculations of virtual loops, we are used to the association: “the number of loops
equals the power of the coupling constant.” For hydrogenic bound states, the situation is dif-
ferent, and the expansion of a bound-state energy, including QED effects, is actually a double
expansion in terms of the QED α ≈ 1/137.036 and the electron-nucleus coupling parameter
Zα, where Z is the nuclear charge number.

1

Speciﬁcally, the leading one-loop energy shifts (due to self-energy and vacuum polarization)
in hydrogenlike systems are of order α (Z α)4mc2, where m is the electron mass and c is the
speed of light. The complete correction in this order was obtained ﬁrst in the years 1948 and
1949 [1, 2, 3, 4]. The leading two-loop energy shifts are of order α2 (Z α)4mc2; the paradigm is
that α counts the number of loops, whereas Zα is a measure of the relativistic corrections that
enter the loop corrections and are typical of the bound-state problem.

When scanning the literature, one should be aware that sometimes, the QED energy shifts are
expressed in terms of atomic units, for which the fundamental energy scale is that of the Hartree,
which equals α2mc2, and therefore the leading QED shift is of order Z 4α3 in atomic units.
The current paper will be concerned mainly with the calculation of the correction of order
α (Z α)6, which is effectively a relativistic correction to the one-loop correction (sic!) due to
the binding of the electron to the nucleus (hence the name “binding corrections”). We thus have
to consider the relativistic atomic physics aspect of the problem in addition to the usual loop
calculation.

The separation of the problem into high- and low-energy virtual photon contributions has been
discussed (e.g.) in §123 of Ref. [5]. In the context of NRQED [6, 7, 8, 9], the general paradigm is
to map the high-energy effects onto effective operators. By contrast, the low-energy effects are
mapped onto the transverse degrees of freedom of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and are integrated
up to some cutoff scale. The systematic expansion of the Wilson coefﬁcients multiplying the
effective operators is rather nontrivial. In the current context, we start from the fully relativistic
expression of the self-energy, and do appropriate expansions for both domains. For the problem
at hand, this conceptually simpler approach has certain pragmatic advantages.

One might well ask why we would need information on the Lamb shift of higher excited states in
the ﬁrst place, especially because the most accurately measured hydrogenic transition involves
the 1S and the metastable 2S level [10]. The answer is that one transition is not enough to
determine fundamental constants like the Rydberg to sufﬁcient accuracy: one needs at least two
transitions. We would like to cite from Ref. [11], a system of equations that illustrates this fact
in a particularly clear way. One combines two of the most accurately measured frequencies
(f1S−2S [10] and a f2S−8D [12] transition), where we can either use 8D3/2 and 8D5/2 for the
8D level, for a determination of the Rydberg. Deﬁning eD as a dimensionless relativistic Dirac
energy, we can schematically establish the following equations,

f1S−2S =R∞ c {eD(2S) − eD(1S)} + L2S − L1S ,

f2S−8D =R∞ c {eD(8D) − eD(2S)} + L8D − L2S .

By L, we refer to the Lamb shift [see Eq. (67) of Ref. [13] for an often-used deﬁnition of this
effect]. We can eliminate L2S using the combination

(1a)

(1b)

(2)

where

W21 = 8L2S − L1S
is independent of the nuclear-size correction (proton radius) and can therefore be determined
theoretically to high accuracy. We can now solve the system of equations (1) for two unknowns:

(3)

L2S =

L1S + W21
8

2

L1S and R∞, provided we have theoretical values for the weighted combination W21 and L8D.
The evaluation of an important contribution to the latter will be one of the issues discussed in
the current brief review.

A generalization of this rather elementary exercise involves a least-squares analysis [14].
Roughly speaking, one tries to ﬁnd the “best ﬁt,” in the sense of least squares, to a set of
experimental results representing the most accurately measured transitions in hydrogen and
deuterium. For the 2002 adjustment [15], a total of 23 transitions in hydrogen and deuterium
have been used as input data. The least-squares analysis includes covariances among the the-
oretical uncertainties. One thus obtains theoretical values, including standard uncertainties, for
the proton radius and the Rydberg, and one can make optimal predictions for other transition
frequencies not used in the adjustment of the constants. Some of the predicted frequencies are
currently more accurate [14] than the predictions for the anomalous magnetic moment of the
electron.

There is another aspect which is relevant to calculations for higher excited states: the extrapo-
lation of the data to higher quantum numbers, for given manifolds of states. For example, we
can extrapolate to higher principal quantum numbers n for given angular momenta (orbital and
spin). In an apparently not widely known paper (Ref. [16]), the one-loop Bethe logarithm has
been evaluated, in terms of a (slowly convergent) integral representation, in the limit of n → ∞.
From this point onwards, the extrapolation to higher principal quantum numbers of the one-loop
nonrelativistic Bethe logarithm, based on a few known low-n results, becomes an interpolation.
However, this calculation uses a few particular properties of the nonrelativistic Bethe logarithm
[order α(Zα)4], which are not applicable to the much more involved correction of order α (Zα)6
(relativistic Bethe logarithm). Nevertheless, it has recently been observed that a large number
of relativistic effects and loop corrections can actually be expressed as an inverse power series
in the principal quantum number [17, 18]. This is not irrelevant because it gives conﬁdence that
such ﬁts, applied to other corrections like the relativistic Bethe logarithm provide us with an
accurate representation of the corrections for large n, where the complex structure of the wave
function leads to a prohibitively large number of terms in intermediate steps of the calculation,
which makes an evaluation impossible even if today’s computer algebra systems [19] are used.

This brief review follows two investigations [18, 20] in which previous treatments of the one-
loop problem were extended to higher quantum numbers, and some general expressions rel-
evant to selected manifolds of bound states were presented. Here, we supplement the results
obtained previously by explicit numerical calculations for 6F, 7F, 6G and 7G states. Further-
more, in Sec. 2, we discuss some general ideas relevant to the calculation, before dwelling on
the low-energy part in Sec. 3. This part, mediated by ultrasoft virtual photons, is one of the
key elements in the treatment of higher excited non-S states. Throughout the paper, we restrict
the discussion to states with nonvanishing orbital angular momentum. Numerical results are
presented in Sec. 4, and conclusions are drawn in Sec. 5.

2 General Ideas

We ﬁrst take the opportunity to refer the reader to the two most comprehensive treatments of
the one-loop self-energy problem for a bound state, which have appeared in the literature up to

3

now and which we are aware of. These are Refs. [21] and [22]. Here, we brieﬂy mention a few
particular aspects of interest which may be useful in ﬁnding a general access to the calculations,
also with regard to a possible independent veriﬁcation. We ﬁx the units so that ~ = c = ǫ0 = 1,
which implies that e2 = 4πα. The electron charge is e, not −e.

In Feynman gauge, the one-loop bound-state self-energy reads

E = i e2

γµ(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

where Dµν(k) is the photon propagator, and CF is the Feynman contour. Lorentz covariance is
explicitly broken by the Coulomb potential V = −Zα/r. The quantity δm is the mass counter
term, and m is the electron mass.

We divide the problem of calculation into two contributions, which correspond to two different
photon energy regions, and two different parts of the photon energy integration contour CF.
The photon energy separation parameter ǫ takes the role of an infrared cutoff for the high-
energy part, and it acts as an ultraviolet cutoff for the low-energy part. The low-energy part may
be expressed as

and the high-energy part EH reads

EL = α

ǫ
(Zα)2 m (cid:19)

,

EH = α

(Zα)n gn

Xn≥4

ǫ
m(cid:17)

(cid:16)

.

The key is to ﬁrst expand both contributions in Zα for small Zα, then in ǫ, for small ǫ. By per-
forming the expansions in that sequence, we automatically assume that (Zα)2m ≪ ǫ. Counter-
intuitively, this is equivalent to performing an expansion for large ǫ, after scaling the powers
of Zα out of the calculation, as will be demonstrated below in Sec. 3.3. It is also important
to realize that the actual numerical value of ǫ is arbitrary. All that matters is the expansion in
systematic expansion in ǫ, including the logarithmic terms. In Refs. [21] and [22], it has been
stressed that different gauges may be used for the evaluation of the low- and the high-energy
parts. This gauge “arbitrariness” (rather than “invariance”) holds only if linear terms in ǫ are
neglected. This remarkable fact is a cornerstone in the construction of nonrelativistic QED La-
grangians (NRQED), where most high-energy effective operators are taken from calculations
carried out in Feynman gauge, but the ultrasoft-scale effects (where the virtual photon energy is
of the order of the atomic binding energy) are calculated in Coulomb gauge.

The general structure of the one-loop energy shift E, for non-S states, is

E = EL + EH =

(Zα)4 me c2

F (Zα) .

The dimensionless function F (Zα) depends on the bound-state quantum numbers and has the
expansion (again, for non-S states)

Here, we ignore higher-order terms irrelevant for the current α (Zα)6-calculation. The indices
of the constant coefﬁcients AXY correspond to the power X of Zα and the power Y of the
logarithm ln[(Zα)−2]. The function F (Zα) is obtained as the sum

F (Zα) = FH(Zα, ǫ) + FL(Zα, ǫ) ,

(9)

where FH corresponds to EH and FL corresponds to EL. The sum F (Zα) is independent of the
cutoff parameter ǫ.
Let us consider the concrete case of the 8D3/2 state. The high-energy part reads

The calculation entails techniques familiar from high-energy physics and is described in detail
in Ref. [22]. The term −1/20 is a consequence of the anomalous magnetic moment of the
electron as described in detail in Chap. 7 of Ref. [23]. The low-energy part is obtained largely
by atomic-physics calculational techniques and reads

and thus free of ǫ, as it should be. A comparison of Eqs. (9) and (12) reveals that

A60(8D3/2) = +0.007723 .

(13)

The generalization of the term −1/20 − (4/3) ln k0(8D) to an arbitrary hydrogenic state is
discussed in A. Model examples illustrating the cancellation of the cutoff parameter ǫ can be
found in Appendix A of Ref. [24] and in Section 2 of Ref. [25].

3 Low–Energy Part

3.1 Orientation

In this brief review, we will focus on the low-energy part (“ultrasoft” scale, ω ∼ (Zα)2 m).

where the fully relativistic Dirac wave functions ψ is used, and the αi = γ0γi matrices are
a noncovariant form of the Dirac γ matrices. The quantity k = |~k| is virtual photon energy.
Note that one should actually supplement a principal value prescription in this formula, because
the lower-lying states generate poles in the integration region k ∈ (0, ǫ) with ǫ ≫ (Zα)2m.
The ensuing problem of the accurate deﬁnition of a resonance eigenvalue has been discussed in
Ref. [26], in the context of two-loop corrections.

It is well known that the Dirac Hamiltonian HD in Eq. (14) can be transformed to the
Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian plus various relativistic corrections, using the Foldy–Wouthuysen
transformation U, which leads to a transformed Hamiltonian UHDU −1. It is this transforma-
tion which is the key to the successful identiﬁcation of all terms which contribute to the low-
energy contribution in a given order of the Zα expansion. Speciﬁcally, one may apply that same
transformation U to the current operator [13],

The result is

(17)

Here, we have dropped terms which couple lower and upper components of the Foldy-
Wouthuysen transformation and lead to vanishing energy shifts within the context of the ǫ-
expansion. The term proportional to ~k ×~σ entails a spin ﬂip, but the leading-order current pj/m
necessitates a change in the angular momentum of the electron. Because of angular momentum
selection rules, we may thus neglect this term in the calculation.

Alternatively, one might have obtained the current (17) by considering a Foldy–Wouthuysen
transformation of a Dirac Hamiltonian with a vector potential ~A included, i.e. a transformation
of ~α · (~p − e ~A) + β m + V instead of ~α · ~p + β m + V . The effective current operator then is
the term that multiplies ~A in the transformed Hamiltonian. That latter approach is used, e.g., in
Ref. [27]. The term

leads to the so-called quadrupole correction. The other current corrections in Eq. (17) are con-
sidered separately and identiﬁes as “relativistic corrections to the current” (see Refs. [13, 28]).
Of course, these corrections have to be supplemented by relativistic corrections to the Hamilto-
nian and to the bound-state energy, as well as corrections to the wave function. These corrections
are well deﬁned and identify all terms relevant in the order α (Zα)6 m.

3.2 Dimensionless energy parameter

One of the advantages of the Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation is that we may carry out all
further calculations using the nonrelativistic form of the bound-state propagator. There exists a
closed-form Sturmian decomposition for all angular components [29, 30, 31],

(19)

Here, a = 1/(Zαm) is the Bohr radius, and (k)c is the Pochhammer symbol. The symbols
L2l+1
denote the associated Laguerre polynomials. The radial integrals can usually be evaluated
k
using standard techniques, which leaves the sum over k as a ﬁnal problem in the calculation
(note that k in this context is to be differentiated from the virtual photon energy which is also
denoted by k in many calculations in this ﬁeld of research). In B, we discuss some important
properties of typical hypergeometric function encountered which result from an evaluation the
sums. Convergence acceleration techniques are useful for accurate calculations of relativistic
effects, because the k-sum is typically slowly convergent for high virtual photon energies.

The nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger–Coulomb Green function for the hydrogen atom [30] reads

(20)

Here, z = ES − k is an energy parameter that involves the Schr¨odinger energy ES of the
reference state. When the photon energy k assumes values in the range (0, ∞), the argument z
ES/z, so that
decreases monotonically from ES < 0 to −∞. The basic idea is now to set t =
t runs from a value t = 1 for k = 0 to a value t = 0 for k = ∞. As a function of Zα and the
principal quantum number n, the quantity t parameterizes the energy argument z as

p

Equation (3.126) of Ref. [22] specializes this transformation to the case n = 2. In Refs. [29, 30,
31], we encounter the notation

which enters into Eqs. (19) and (20). An expansion for large k then corresponds to an expansion
for small t (see B).

3.3 Extraction of a ﬁnite part

In many cases, it is necessary, within bound-state calculations, to extract a nonlogarithmic,
constant term from an integral that contains a variety of divergent contributions in the ultraviolet

7

domain. Here, we discuss possible algorithms which can be used for such calculations, and
which may eventually be useful for an independent veriﬁcation of the results reported here. For
example, the ﬁnite parts which lead to the relativistic Bethe logarithms might be alternatively
extracted using a discretized Schr¨odinger–Coulomb propagator on a lattice [32]. In this case,
it is necessary to have a means for extracting nonlogarithmic terms numerically rather than
analytically. We believe that an independent veriﬁcation of the nonlogarithmic terms, using
purely numerical methods, could be a very worthful cross-check of the analytic approach (up to
the last stage of the calculation where the integrals are evaluated numerically) which was used
in previous evaluations.

In order to approach this problem, we ﬁrst consider a model calculation inspired by the structure
of the nonrelativistic integrand that leads to the Bethe logarithm in Eq. (37) below. It consists in
the evaluation of the integral

I =

dk k

Λ

Z
0

(Zα)2
k + h(Zα)2

=(Zα)2Λ − (Zα)4 h ln

Λ + (Zα)2h

(cid:18)

(Zα)2h (cid:19)

and in the extraction of the logarithmic and nonlogarithmic terms (ǫ prescription), or in the cal-
culation of just the nonlogarithmic term (numerical evaluation of generalized Bethe logarithms).

The ﬁrst prescription would consist in expanding the integral for large Λ, and dropping all linear,
quadratic etc. terms for large Λ. In this way, we obtain the result

Let us now consider a variation of the ﬁrst prescription. We go to atomic units, i.e. scale all
powers of Zα out of the integrand via the transformation k → (Zα)2k. We then deﬁne λ =
Λ/(Zα)2 and obtain

where the last form is obtained after dropping the linear and (possibly further) quadratic terms;
the ﬁnal result is in full agreement with Eq. (24).

The second prescription is based on the identiﬁcation Λ → ǫ. We ﬁrst expand the result in
Eq. (23) in powers of Zα, which entails the replacement

I ∼ −(Zα)4 h ln

terms. We thus obtain the result

I ∼ −(Zα)4 h ln

ǫ
(Zα)2h(cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

which is equivalent to the result in Eq. (24) upon the identiﬁcation Λ → ǫ. This illustrates that
the expansion in small ǫ after the expansion in Zα is actually an expansion for ǫ ≫ (Zα)2m,
after dropping the linear terms. In particular, all of the above prescriptions lead to the result

for the nonlogarithmic term.

x → ∞ ,

(29)

Xn=−1,−1/2,0,1/2,...,m

and we wish to evaluate the nonlogarithmic term N that is generated by the integral

for large Λ. In the sense of Eq. (23), we would have f (x) = x(Zα)2/[x + h(Zα)2] and and
N = (Zα)4 h ln ((Zα)2h). For the more general case [see Eq. (29)], we deﬁne

results in three minus signs. Analogous considerations have recently been used in Refs. [33, 34].

4 Numerical Results

For the states under investigation, the A60 coefﬁcients are listed in Tables 1 and 2. For the
5F5/2 state, the result had previously been recorded as 0.002 403 158, and for 5F7/2, a value
of 0.008 087 020 had been indicated (see Ref. [20]). The correction of this result, in the last
decimal, is beyond current and projected levels of experimental accuracy. For the current brief
review, we re-evaluate many of the integrals leading to the A60 coefﬁcients with an enhanced
number of integration nodes. The two entries in question change by more than the previously
indicated numerical accuracy. Results for 6F, 7F, 6G, and 7G as reported in Tables 1 and 2 are
obtained here. In Ref. [18], we already corrected a computational error for 3P1/2 as previously
reported in Eq. (96) of Ref. [28], where a value of −1.14768(1) had been given. As in previous
calculations (see Refs. [13, 28]), certain remaining one-dimensional integrals involving (partial
derivatives of) hypergeometric functions could only be evaluated numerically. For n = 8, we
recall the results [18] A60(8D3/2) = 0.007 723 850 and A60(8D5/2) = 0.034 607 492.

5 Conclusions

The challenges of bound-state quantum electrodynamic calculations are associated to the ac-
curacy of the experimental veriﬁcations, to the signiﬁcance of the theory for the determination

10

of the fundamental constants, and to the conceptual complexity of the calculations which is
derived from the apparent simplicity of the physical systems under study. The latter aspect is
developed to full extent only if an accurate understanding is required in higher orders of pertur-
bation theory.
Let us brieﬂy discuss possible extensions of this work in addition to the independent veriﬁ-
cation using a more numerically inspired approach, as outlined in Sec. 3.3. In Refs. [24, 35],
calculations of the ﬁne-structure splitting for P states are described which rely on a form-factor
approach; this would be equivalent to using an effective operator for the high-energy part. Usu-
ally, NRQED-inspired calculations involve a high-energy part, which takes care of the con-
tribution of the high-energy virtual photons, and which is given by effective operators, and a
low-energy part, which is given by photons whose energy is of the order of the electron binding
energy. The latter integration region is often referred to as the “ultrasoft scale” in the literature
(see, e.g., Refs. [7, 8, 9, 36, 37]). The two scales (sometimes three, if one makes an additional
distinction with regard to electron momenta) require a completely separate treatment and can-
not be calculated on the same footing. Thus, the introduction of scale-separation parameters is
required. These cancel at the end of the calculation. For the high-energy effective operators,
this scale-separation parameter takes the role of an infrared cutoff, whereas for the low-energy
contributions, the scale-separation parameter gives a natural scale for the failure of the nonrela-
tivistic (“ultrasoft”) approximation to the virtual photons, i.e. it acts as an ultraviolet cutoff. This
property is characteristic of QED bound-state calculations and is a feature that adds a certain
twist to the analysis which is not present in usual quantum-ﬁeld theoretic loop calculations.

A Mass renormalization and the leading-order result

In the ﬁrst articles on the self-energy, the concepts of mass renormalization and covariant inte-
gration were developed and applied for the ﬁrst time to the calculation of observable physical
effects. The leading-order energy shift, of order α(Zα)4m c2, is the sum of a Dirac F1 form-
factor contribution, an anomalous magnetic moment term (F2 electron form factor), a vacuum-
polarization term, and an effect mediated by low-energy virtual photons. The latter contribution
can be interpreted as an “average virtual excitation energy”, as a “logarithmic sum” or, as it
is most widely called, a “Bethe logarithm” ln k0. One may therefore point out that the leading
order-α(Zα)4-effect summarizes already the core of most properties of the electron mediated by
the virtual interactions with the quantum ﬁelds. The self-energy of a bound electron is actually
the difference of the self energies of a bound and a free electron, the latter being attributable
to its mass, wherefore it can be reabsorbed into a redeﬁned physical parameter entering the
Lagrangian of QED.
Yet at the same time, it is important to remember that different energy scales enter the prob-
lem: (a) the atomic binding energy and (b) the relativistic electron rest mass energy scale. The
separation is already explained in §123 of Ref. [5], and its extension to higher orders in the Zα
expansion is discussed in this brief review.
The generalization of the α(Zα)4m-part of the result in Eq. (12) to an arbitrary non-S state,
reads

where κ = 2(l − j)(j + 1/2), with the usual meaning for the bound-state angular momen-

Here, φ is the nonrelativistic (Schr¨odinger) form of the bound-state wave function.
It took 50 years [1, 2, 3, 4, 40] to advance our understanding from the order α(Zα)4mec2 to
the order α(Zα)6mec2. For a successful calculation of the higher-order relativistic corrections,
it has been essential to master the much more involved analytic, covariant integrations in the
high-energy part, and to advance our understanding of relativistic and retardation corrections to
the current. Also, the possibility of handling very involved analytic intermediate expressions by
computer algebra has become an essential ingredient of the modern calculations.

Finally, let us remark that for low-lying states, it is possible to evaluate the one-loop effect
numerically to very high accuracy [41, 42, 43], even for low nuclear charge numbers. For very
highly excited states, however, ﬁrst exploratory work has revealed that the numerical difﬁculties
associated with the renormalization are still rather prohibitive in the context of an accurate
numerical evaluation, because it entails a loss of more than twelve decimals for higher excited
states. In addition, the wave functions become much more complex, and this inhibits a fast
convergence of the numerical integrations, leading to the temporary conclusion that analytic
calculations are still preferable for higher excited states, in the domain of low nuclear charge
numbers.

B Asymptotics

We here discuss the asymptotics of two hypergeometric functions that are often encountered in
bound-state calculations of the kind [13, 18, 21, 28] considered in the current brief review. The
ﬁrst of these functions is

Φ1(n, t) = 2F1(1, −nt, 1 − nt, ξ) = −nt

(38)

Xk=0

,

which develops singularities at t = k/n. These correspond to lower-lying states and their
equidistant spacing is a consequence of the energy parameterization discussed in Sec. 3.2. For
given n, there are typically n − 1 lower-lying states accessible by dipole decay, and thus n − 1
singularities at t = m/n, for m = 1, . . . n − 1, as t is in the range (0, 1). The argument ξ of the
hypergeometric typically reads

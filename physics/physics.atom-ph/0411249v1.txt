Abstract

Three diﬀerent conﬁgurations of compact magneto-optical sources of slow 87Rb atoms (LVIS,

2D+-MOT and 2D-MOT) were compared with each other at ﬁxed geometry of cooling laser beams.

A precise control of the intensity balances between the four separate transverse cooling laser beams

provided a total continuous ﬂux of cold atoms from the LVIS and 2D+-MOT sources about 8 × 109

atoms/s at total laser power of 60 mW. The ﬂux was measured directly from the loading rate of a

3D-MOT, placed 34 cm downstream from the sources. Average velocities of the cooled atomic beam

for the LVIS and 2D+-MOT sources were about 8.5 m/s and 11 m/s respectively. An essential

advantage of the compact magneto-optical sources is that their background ﬂux of thermal atoms

is two to three orders of the magnitude smaller than the ﬂux of slow atoms.

INTRODUCTION

Eﬃcient loading of atomic traps in an ultra-high-vacuum environment,

like UHV

Magneto-Optical Traps (MOT) [1] or magnetic guides [2, 3], requires intense beams of

slow atoms. The most intense source of slow atoms is a Zeeman slower [4] and for Rb can

provide ﬂuxes of up to 1011 at/s at velocities of 30 m/s. The main disadvantages of Zeeman

slowers are their complexity, large size, essential stray magnetic ﬁelds, large ﬁnal divergence

of cold atoms and high background of thermal atoms. The general concept of atomic beam

deceleration requires an initial thermal beam with a ﬂux, which exceeds the ﬁnal ﬂux of

cold atoms by at least one order of magnitude. Therefore many UHV experiments, which

are sensitive to intense background ﬂux of thermal atoms, demand an additional in-vacuum

mechanical shutter to block the thermal atomic beam. Introducing such a shutter inside

an UHV chamber, even in the high-pressure part, is a challenging problem, taking into ac-

count that many of these experiments, like BEC experiments [5], are sensitive to mechanical

vibrations.

of thermal atoms.

The concept of magneto-optical sources of atoms is quite diﬀerent - to extract slow atoms

from an ultra-cold sample of atoms prepared in a magneto-optical trap. The advantages of

this approach are very small velocity and divergence of extracted atoms and low background

The main motivation of this work was to create a compact, robust, economic and eﬃcient

magneto-optical source of cold atoms for loading an UHV MOT of a Rb fountain standard

of frequency. The main demand on the source in that experiment was to have a high ﬂux of

cold atoms at minimum background of thermal atoms. This goal was achieved by minimizing

the length of the source chamber and introducing an additional diﬀerential tube between

the MOT-source and UHV-MOT chambers. An essential diﬀerence of our MOT-source,

compared to previous ones [3, 6, 7], is that for transverse cooling of atoms, four independent

laser beams are used instead of retroreﬂected beams. This allows us to get a perfect balance

between these beams and achieve maximum ﬂux of cold atoms at smaller power of light.

In this paper, Section 2 describes the model of the MOT source, which is exploited to

estimate the ﬂux and velocity of the beam of cold atoms produced by the source. In Section

3 the measurements of the main parameters of three diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the MOT

source (LVIS, 2D+-MOT and 2D-MOT) are presented and compared to the theoretical

2

results. In the concluding Section 4 the main results of the work are summarized.

II. MODEL OF THE MOT-SOURCE

Any continuous MOT-source of slow atoms consists of a magneto-optical trap with a

dark channel in it, through which the slow atoms are extracted. The ﬁrst and the most

straightforward version of such a low-velocity intense source (LVIS) [6] is based on a standard

3D-MOT, in which one of the six beams has a dark channel at its centre. A 2D+-MOT [7]

is very similar to an LVIS except that it uses a two-dimensional quadruple magnetic ﬁeld.

A pure 2D-MOT [8] uses only four laser beams for transverse cooling of atoms and a two-

dimensional transverse quadruple magnetic ﬁeld. As it was shown in [8], the pure 2D-MOT

source of short length is expected to be much less eﬃcient than the compact LVIS and

2D+-MOT sources.

To estimate basic parameters of the sources a very simpliﬁed model of the MOT-source,

based on a two-level model of an atom, which excludes all stochastic processes related to

spontaneous scattering of photons, was applied. The corresponding dissipative force, which

describes the motion of an atom in the trap, is given by

~Ftot(x, y, z) = ~Fx+ + ~Fx− + ~Fy+ + ~Fy− + C(z)( ~Fz+ + A(x, y) ~Fz−),

the unperturbed atomic transition ω0, ∇Bl is the gradient of magnetic ﬁeld along the cor-

responding l-axes and Γ is a natural FWHM width of the atomic transition.

The orientation of the anti-Helmholtz coils along the y-axis assumes that ∇By =
−2∇Bx = −2∇Bz. The factor µ′ = 5µB/6 is an averaged magnetic moment of the

J = 1/2 → J = 3/2 atomic transition, where µB is the Bohr magneton constant. The

factor of six in front of the saturation parameter in the denominator of the force is intro-

3

duced to take into account the cross-saturation of six laser beams. Equation (1) is empirical

but provides the right magnitude of the force at low and high values of the saturation

It is also in reasonable agreement with our experimental observations. The
parameter.
coeﬃcient A(x, y) = 1 − exp[−2(x8 + y8)/a8] in front of the ~Fz+ modelled the extraction
channel of radius a in one of the laser beams of the LVIS or the 2D+-MOT. The second factor

C(z) = 1/(1 + exp[8(z −b)]) modelled the retroreﬂecting mirror of the source, which was set-

ting up a border for the intensity of the longitudinal laser beams at a distance z = b = 2 cm

from the centre of the trap. Both functions A(x, y) and C(z) were chosen to be steep enough

to provide adequate results, but not too steep thus allowing the numerical integration of the
Newtonian equation of atomic motion in the ﬁeld of the force ~Ftot(x, y, z). Based on the

model of the trapping force presented, a numerical solution of a system of diﬀerential equa-

tions, characterizing a classical motion of atoms in the trap, was solved. Fig. 1 illustrates

a two-dimensional motion of ten Rb atoms in the XOZ plane of the LVIS. All atoms start

at a distance w from the centre of the trap with their velocities within the capture range

of the MOT. Here we used the same parameters as in the experiment: Γ = 2π × 6.0 MHz,

∇By = 8 G/cm, w = 1.25 cm, a = 0.1 cm, b = 2 cm, s0 = 3, ∆ = −3Γ. The two upper

rectangles simulate the retroreﬂecting mirror with a 2 mm hole in its centre.

This model makes it possible to estimate the maximum ﬂux of the MOT-source and

the velocity distribution of extracted atoms. As it was shown in reference [6], when the

extraction of atoms from the source is much faster than the collision rate between them,

the total ﬂux of cold atoms Φ of the LVIS is simply equal to the loading rate of the trap R.

Later on in the paper [7] an additional factor, which is taking into account the losses due

to collisions of cold atoms with background thermal atoms, was introduced. In our case the

loading rate of the MOT-source was calculated as

Z Z Z~v< ~vc
where n87 ≃ 2.16 × 109 at/cm3 is the total density of 87Rb atoms, S is the area of the

(2)

surface surrounding the trap, v⊥ is the component of the atomic velocity, which is normal to

the surface S and directed inwards the trap and g(~v, T ) is the Maxwell-Boltzmann probability

weighting factor for the atoms of velocity ~v. The integration was performed only over the

velocity class of atoms trapped in the MOT by the damping force introduced above. For

4

values of the saturation parameter s0 between 0.5 and 8, the corresponding maximum radial

capture velocities of the MOT-source range between 23 m/s and 34 m/s. The factor Kcoll in

equation (2) represents the reduction of the ﬂux due to collisions of cold rubidium atoms with

thermal background rubidium atoms. As in paper [7] we suppose that these collisions mostly

aﬀect the cold atoms during their motion towards the output of the MOT source. Therefore
the loss factor can be deﬁned as Kcoll = exp(−Γbeamtout), where Γbeam = σef f nRb¯v ≈ 415 s−1

is the rate of the collisions between the cold atoms of the beam with thermal Rb atoms,

tout ≈ 2 ms is the mean travelling time of the captured atoms from the centre to the output of
the MOT. To calculate Γbeam we used the eﬀective collision cross section σef f = 2×10−12 cm2

[7, 8], the total density nRb of both the main isotopes of Rb and average thermal velocity of
atoms ¯v = 270 m/s. We estimate the total density as nRb = n85 +n87 = 7.7×109 at/cm3 from
the pressure of Rb vapor P= 3.17 × 10−7 mbar at our room temperature T=296 according

to data of [9].

The Fig. 2 shows the calculated loading rate and therefore the maximum ﬂux of the LVIS

source as a function of the maximum saturation parameter s0 of cooling laser beams.

The calculated velocity distributions of atoms extracted from the LVIS and the 2D+-MOT

are shown in Fig. 3. To model the 2D+-MOT the longitudinal gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld

∇Bz was set to zero. One can see that the total ﬂuxes of LVIS and 2D+-MOT are nearly
equal to one another. On the other hand, the average velocity of slow atoms in the 2D+-

MOT (≃ 9 m/s) is slightly higher than the velocity of the LVIS beam (≃ 8 m/s). The

velocity of the LVIS is lower because of the Zeeman shift, which detunes the frequency of
the pushing beam ~Fz+ out of resonance with atomic transition as atoms are moving towards

the output of the source. The model shows that the average velocity of extracted atoms

strongly depends on the distance between the center of the trap and its output border,

formed by the retroreﬂecting mirror. Obviously the longer acceleration distance leads to

higher velocities of extracted atoms.

An estimate of the ﬂux of thermal atoms for the retroreﬂecting mirror of 6 mm thickness

with a 2 mm central hole gives the total background ﬂux of both Rb isotopes, of about

1.9 × 107 at/s. This ﬂux is nearly 3 orders of the magnitude smaller than the calculated ﬂux

of cold atoms at s0 > 3. The most critical parameter for reducing the background thermal

ﬂux is the length of the diﬀerential tube, formed by the hole in the mirror.

III. EXPERIMENT

An experimental setup of a MOT-source is shown in Fig. 4. A standard DN40 stainless

steel cross with ﬁve standard optical viewports was used as the body of the source. Inside

the output port of the cube an ensemble of retro-reﬂecting optics, consisting of a gold-coated

mirror with a λ/4-retardation plate on top of it, was installed. Both elements were of 25 mm

in diameter and had a 2 mm hole in a centre. The mirror had a width of 6 mm and was

attached to a copper holder of 12.5 mm width with 2.5 mm channel in its centre. The distance

between the front reﬂecting surface of the mirror and the MOT’s centre was minimized and

equal to 20 mm. The diﬀerential tube, formed by the mirror and its holder, was used both

for pumping the volume of the MOT-source and at the same time for extraction of slow

atoms. An important function of this tube was to reduce the background ﬂux of thermal

atoms. All the cooling laser beams were produced with ﬁve polarization-maintaining ﬁbres

and collimation lenses having a focal length of 150 mm. The resulting diameter of the beams

at 1/e2 intensity level was about 2.5 cm.

The main pair of anti-Helmholtz magnetic coils was oriented along the y-axis. These coils

provided in a centre of the trap the magnetic ﬁeld gradients of ∇By = 8 G/cm and ∇Bx =

∇Bz = −4 G/cm correspondingly. An additional pair of anti-Helmholtz coils compensated

the gradient of the main coils along the z-axis and produced a two-dimensional quadruple

ﬁeld, which was necessary for realization of the 2D-MOT and the 2D+-MOT conﬁgurations

of the source.

The cooling light, resonant with the 5S1/2(F = 2) → 5P3/2(F ′ = 3) transition of 87Rb,
was provided by a tapered-ampliﬁer diode laser. The typical power in each of the four

transverse cooling beams was about 12 mW and the power of the longitudinal cooling beam
was about 10 mW. An additional diode laser, resonant with the 5S1/2(F = 1) → 5P3/2(F ′ =
2) transition, was used for repumping atoms from the 5S1/2(F = 1) ground hyperﬁne state.

To measure the ﬂux of slow atoms, produced by the MOT-sources, the atoms were trapped

by a second 3D-MOT. The residual gas pressure in the 3D-MOT section of the vacuum
chamber was about 10−9 mbar. The measurement of a loading rate of the 3D-MOT directly

gave the value of the ﬂux. The advantage of the method, compared to the approach used

in references [3, 6, 7, 8], is that it does not rely on how precisely the overall density and the

velocity distribution of atoms in the beam are known. Therefore, the measurement of the

6

ﬂux is as precise as the number of atoms accumulated in a 3D-MOT is known. The 3D-MOT

was set up at a distance of 34 cm from the source and had a standard six-orthogonal-beams

conﬁguration. The diameters of the laser beams were the same as in the MOT-source and

the power of each of them was about 4 mW. A separate repumping laser beam of the same

diameter with power of 5 mW was also applied. The beam of cold atoms entered the 3D-

MOT along one of its diagonals. A standard frequency detuning of the 3D-MOT was the

same as for the MOT-source and equal to ∆ = −3Γ.

Three diﬀerent conﬁgurations of compact MOT-sources were tested. The LVIS was

formed by ﬁve laser beams of the correct circular polarizations. A three-dimensional

quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld of the LVIS was produced by the main pair of magnetic coils

oriented along the y-axis. The only the diﬀerence of the 2D+-MOT was that the two-

dimensional quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld was used instead of the three-dimensional one. For

that purpose a pair of anti-Helmholtz coils, oriented along the z-axis (see Fig. 4) and produc-

ing a gradient of ∇Bz = 4 G/cm was added. As a result the gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld

along the z-axis was completely eliminated and the transverse gradients were equalized to

the values of ∇By = 6 G/cm and ∇Bx = −6 G/cm. The conﬁguration of the pure 2D-MOT

was the same as the 2D+-MOT, except that the laser beam along the z-axis was switched

oﬀ.

The loading cuves of the 3D-MOT from the three diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the MOT-

source are presented in Fig. 5. Each of the curves there is an average of three subsequent

loading cycles. To calibrate the number of atoms in the 3D-MOT a standard procedure was

applied [10]. For that purpose an additional circularly polarized probe beam, overlapped

with the centre of the 3D-MOT was introduced. The frequency of the probe was detuned
from the 5S5/2(F = 2) → 5P3/2(F ′ = 3) transition by ∆ = −3Γ. Such a detuning of the

probe was chosen to reduce its absorption by the sample of cold atoms. The whole sequence

of the measurement was as follows. First, a small number of atoms (< 108) was collected

in a 3D-MOT. The loading of the MOT was stopped by switching oﬀ the cooling light of

the MOT-source. Then the magnetic ﬁeld of the 3D-MOT was switched oﬀ and after an

additional delay of 10 ms all cooling beams of the 3D-MOT were also shut down. At the

same moment the probe beam was switched on and the ﬂuorescence of atoms was measured

with a calibrated photodiode. The response time of the photodiode was fast enough to

detect the ﬂuorescence signal within ﬁrst few hundred microseconds, before atoms were

7

blown away by spontaneous force of the probe light beam. Based on the formula for the rate

of spontaneous scattering of monochromatic light by a two-level atom and the measured

power of the ﬂuorescence, the total number of atoms in the 3D-MOT was estimated. In

that way the photodiode’s signal was normalized to the number of atoms in the 3D-MOT.

This normalization was valid for a small number of atoms in the MOT, but might not be

correct for the maximum number of loaded atoms, because of absorption of the MOT beams

in the atomic sample. However, the loading atomic ﬂux is determined only by the loading

rate of the MOT at the very beginning of the process, so the calibration of the photodiode

described above showed the right estimate of the atomic ﬂux. The Fig. 5 shows that the

ﬂuxes of LVIS and 2D+-MOT are nearly equal to one another and are about 8 × 109 at/s.

This ﬂux provided loading of about 1.3 × 1010 atoms into a 3D-MOT in just three seconds.

Although, our calibration, as it was mentioned above, is not very precise for such large

number of atoms. The pure 2D-MOT provides a much smaller ﬂux of 2 × 108 at/s. Such a

poor ﬂux of a short-length version of a 2D-MOT source was expected according to the results

of our previous investigations [8]. In absence of cooling laser beams the source emitted only a

background beam of thermal atoms. The ﬂux of this background thermal beam was so small

that no trapped atoms were detected in the 3D-MOT. This observation strongly supports

the theoretical estimates of this ﬂux to be two-three orders of magnitude smaller than the

ﬂux of cold atoms.

The velocity distribution of atoms extracted from the MOT-source was measured by a

standard time-of-ﬂight (TOF) technique [6, 7]. A fast switching of the atomic beam inten-

sity was realized by introducing an additional plug-in laser beam, which deﬂected atoms

transversely just in front of the retro-reﬂecting mirror. This beam had a diameter of 2 mm,

a power of 10 mW and was switched with an acousto-optical modulator. In our experiment,

instead of using a single perpendicular laser beam to detect atoms at some distance from the

source, four beams of the 3D-MOT were used. For that purpose one pair of couterpropagat-

ing beams of the 3D-MOT was switched oﬀ. The other four beams of the MOT, which had
an angle of ≃ 54◦ with respect to the atomic beam, provided a very fast two-dimensional

transverse cooling of atoms and their concentration at the centre of such a 2D-MOT. To

increase the velocity resolution of the TOF measurement, the diameters of the laser beams

were reduced down to 1 cm. The resulted velocity distributions of atoms extracted from

the LVIS and the 2D+-MOT are presented in Fig. 6. One can see that the velocity of the

8

LVIS (8.5 m/s) is lower than the velocity of the 2D+-MOT (11 m/s). The mean velocities of

atoms extracted from the sources agree remarkably well with the predictions of our simpli-

ﬁed model (see Fig. 3). The FWHM widths of the model velocity distributions were 3.0 m/s

and 4.5 m/s correspondingly. The larger widths of the experimentally measured velocity

distributions can be explained by the stochastic nature of the spontaneous force, which was

not taken into account in the model.

The Fig. 7 presents a dependence of the LVIS ﬂux on a total power of cooling laser beams.

At maximum available total laser power of 60 mW (≃ 12 mW per beam) the maximum

saturation parameter in each of the laser beams of the LVIS is s0 ≃ 3. For the same

light intensities the model predicts approximately the same total ﬂux of atoms of about

8 × 109 at/s.

In Fig. 8 a dependence of the atomic ﬂux on the imbalance between powers of the two

cooling laser beams, directed along the y-axis is given. One can see that the atomic ﬂux

decreases to less than half if the imbalance factor (Py− − Py+)/Py− + Py+) is as small as 0.1.

For simultaneous imbalance in both pairs of transverse laser beams the decrease of the ﬂux

is expected to be twice larger. Taking into account essential absorption losses of laser power

in Rb vapors, at vacuum viewports and retroreﬂection optics, it is unlikely that the gain in

laser power, achieved by using retroreﬂection optics, would compensate for the losses due to

intensity imbalances of the laser beams.

IV. CONCLUSION

It is shown that for well balanced intensities of cooling laser beams the ﬂuxes of slow atoms

produced by the LVIS and 2D+-MOT sources are nearly the same, but that the velocity of

atoms extracted from the 2D+-MOT are slightly higher. The maximum ﬂux ≃ 8 × 109 at/s

was achieved with laser power of 60 mW. Both the experimental measurements and the model

presented suggest strong evidence that the observed ﬂux of slow atoms is the maximum ﬂux

achievable for the size and power of cooling laser beams used. This ﬂux is 1.5 times higher

than the ﬂux of the original LVIS [6], achieved with 500 mW of laser power, and the same

as maximum ﬂux produced by a compact 2D+-MOT [3] with laser power of 300 mW. The

conclusion of this work is that the eﬃciencies of the LVIS and 2D+-MOT sources of slow

atoms in a case of compact conﬁguration are nearly the same and determined mainly by

9

available laser power.

The compact MOT source will be used in our Rb fountain atomic frequency standard.

The achieved ﬂux of 8 × 109 at/s allows us to load about 109 atoms in just 125 ms, which is

a good starting condition for an intense Rb fountain.

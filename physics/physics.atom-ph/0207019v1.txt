A Raman conﬁguration of counterpropagating traveling wave ﬁelds, one of which is lin⊥lin
8 periodic-
8 periodicity. Using

polarized and the other linklin polarized, is shown to lead to optical potentials having λ
ity. Such optical potentials may be used to construct optical lattices having λ
numerical diagonalization, we obtain the optical potentials for 85Rb atoms.

Recently, we proposed a new method for producing
atom gratings having λ/4 periodicity, where λ is the
wavelength of the radiation ﬁeld driving the optical tran-
sitions [1]. The method is based on Raman transitions
that are simultaneously driven by two pairs of coun-
terpropagating waves. Usually, atom interactions with
counterpropagating resonant ﬁelds leads to atom grat-
ings having overall periodicity λ/2. A number of tech-
niques have been developed to reduce this periodicity,
such as harmonic suppression [2,3,5,4,6,7], fractional Tal-
bot eﬀect [8,9], atom lens ﬁltering [10,11] and large angle
beam splitters [12–18], but the basic starting point is the
λ
2 periodicity atom gratings. The scheme considered in
[1] allows one to reduce this fundamental periodicity to
λ/4; the methods referred to above can then be used to
reduced this periodicity even further. In this brief report,
we show that the basic Raman geometry leads to optical
potentials having λ/8 periodicity.

G′, m′

The atom-ﬁeld geometry of the Raman scheme is de-
picted in Fig. 1. One needs two pairs of counterprop-
agating ﬁelds. Each pair of ﬁelds, labeled by the sub-
script j = 1, 2, itself consists of a pair of counterpropa-
gating ﬁelds labeled by the subscript α = 1 or 2. The
value α = 1 corresponds to a ﬁeld that drives transitions
|G, mgi ↔ |H, mhi and the value α = 2 corresponds to
g(cid:11) ↔ |H, mhi, where
a ﬁeld that drives transitions (cid:12)
(cid:12)
H, mh are angular momenta and Zeeman quantum num-
bers of the excited state hyperﬁne manifold and G, mg
and G′, m′
g are angular momenta and Zeeman quantum
numbers of two ground state hyperﬁne manifolds, sepa-
rated by frequency ωG′G. Field Eαj = E11 corresponds
to a ﬁeld in the ﬁrst Raman pair that drives G ↔ H
transitions, ﬁeld E21 corresponds to a ﬁeld in the ﬁrst
Raman pair that drives G′ ↔ H transitions, ﬁeld E12
corresponds to a ﬁeld in the second Raman pair that
drives G ↔ H transitions, and ﬁeld E22 corresponds to a
ﬁeld in the second Raman pair that drives G′ ↔ H tran-
sitions. Each pair of Raman ﬁelds produces two-quantum
g(cid:11) and the Raman detuning
transition |G, mgi ↔ (cid:12)
(cid:12)
δ is the same for each pair of ﬁelds. However, a criti-
cal assumption of the model is that the diﬀerent pairs
of Raman ﬁelds cannot interfere on single-photon tran-

G′, m′

sitions, e.g. the excited state population in the H man-
ifold has no interference term associated with ﬁelds E11
and E12 and no interference term associated with ﬁelds
E21 and E22. This can be accomplished in a number
of ways - ﬁelds E11 and E12 can have diﬀerent frequen-
cies, diﬀerent polarizations or random frequency noise.
Even though interference on single photon transitions is
suppressed, the pairs of Raman ﬁelds can interfere and
act as a standing-wave Raman ﬁeld in driving transitions
between states G and G′. If the ﬁelds propagate along
the z axis and if second Raman pair counterpropagates
relative to the ﬁrst, one is led to a transition amplitude
evolving as cos(2kz) and an atomic density having λ/4
periodicity.

Gratings involving Raman transition have been ana-
lyzed [19–22] for the case of standing waves acting on
the each optical transition. Owing to the spatially mod-
ulated ac-Stark shifts of the atomic levels, one can achieve
in this case only λ
2 overall periodicity. Our geometry is
diﬀerent. Since the ﬁelds do not interfere on single pho-
ton transitions, the λ

2 periodicty is suppressed.

In our previous article [1], we showed that the period-
icity of the atom gratings could be reduced to λ
8 if one
pair of Raman ﬁelds is lin⊥lin polarized and the other
is linklin polarized, e.g.

E11kE12kE22⊥E21.

This result is the Raman analogue of the conventional
lin⊥lin polarized ﬁeld geometry for electronic transi-
tions, which, in the far-detuned case, leads to the λ
4 -
period atom gratings [23] and optical lattices [24]. The
calculations of Ref. [1] were aimed mainly at situations

1

involving atom scattering in the Raman-Nath approxi-
mation; however, it was pointed out in that article that
the formalism could also be applied to cw optical ﬁelds.
To illustrate this possibility, we proceed to calculate
the optical potentials for 85Rb when the ﬁeld polariza-
tions are given by Eq. (1). The resulting optical poten-
tials have λ
8 periodicity and may enable one to construct
optical lattices having this periodicity. By diagonalizing

numerically the Hamiltonian derived in [1], we obtain the
optical potentials associated with the G = 2, 3 ground
state hyperﬁne manifolds of 85Rb. The results of the cal-
culations are shown in Fig. 2 and Table I. The optical
potentials have been displaced to ﬁt on a single graph -
mean values for each of the potentials are listed in the
Table.

If the quantization axis is chosen along the wave-
vectors, the selection rule for two-quantum transitions
is ∆mg = 0, ±2, implying that sub-systems having even
and odd Zeeman quantum numbers are decoupled from
one another, and can be diagonalized independently. We

assume that all ﬁelds drive only D2 transitions in 85Rb,
such that the electronic angular momenta for ground and
excited states are JG = 1/2 and JH = 3/2. We choose
ﬁeld detunings ∆1j for |G = 2i ↔ |H = 1i transitions as
∆11 = 2π × 40 MHz and ∆12 = 2π × 61 MHz (both de-

2

tunings between the H = 2 and H = 3 excited state
hyperﬁne levels), Poynting vectors Sαj = 0.2 W/cm2,
and a Raman detuning δ = 2π × 1.0 MHz. The eigen-
states for each potential is a z-dependent mixture of
magnetic sublevels belonging to the diﬀerent hyperﬁne
manifolds. Each eigenstate maps into a single magnetic
substate only when one turns oﬀ the ﬁelds. Even in
this case identiﬁcation of the potentials is a problem,
since magnetic sublevels for diﬀerent manifolds are de-
generate. To overcome this problem we insert a small
∼ 2π × 10 KHz equidistant splitting of the sublevels.
Following the smooth dependence of the potentials’ po-
sitions and amplitudes as the ﬁelds’ Poynting vector is
reduced to Sαj = 20 µW/cm2, we can assign in Fig. 2
the asymptotic identiﬁcation of each potential curve with
a speciﬁc magnetic state sublevel.

It is not always possible to produce λ

8 period optical
potentials using the ﬁeld polarizations given in Eq. (1).
In certain limiting cases, the potentials are ﬂat for these
polarizations. For example, if one detunes far from each
hyperﬁne transition, ﬁelds E11 and E21 do not drive Ra-
man transitions (see Eq.
(11) of Ref. [1]) and no in-
terference between the diﬀerent pairs of Raman ﬁelds is
possible. Also for transitions such as G, G′, H = 1, 2, 1
or G, G′, H = 1, 2, 2 the fact that the transition matrix
elements vanish between states having the same angular
momentum and m = 0 suppresses interference between
the diﬀerent pairs of Raman ﬁelds. This implies that the
optical potentials for 87Rb are ﬂat with the ﬁeld polar-
izations given in Eq. (1).

The possibility to produce optical potentials having a
depth of a 100 recoil energy shifts with available laser
sources suggests that λ
8 -period optical lattices could be
constructed using the Raman technique. It remains to
calculate diﬀusion losses and nonadiabatic coupling to
determine the equilibrium spatial distribution of atoms
in these potentials.

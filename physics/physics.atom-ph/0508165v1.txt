Abstract

Recent experiments have demonstrated that highly charged ions can be guided through insulating

nanocapillaries along the direction of the capillary axis for a surprisingly wide range of injection

angles. Even more surprisingly, the transmitted particles remain predominantly in their initial

charge state, thus opening the pathway to the construction of novel ion-optical elements without

electric feedthroughs. We present a theoretical treatment of this self-organized guiding process.

We develop a classical trajectory transport theory that relates the microscopic charge-up with

macroscopic material properties. Transmission coeﬃcients, angular spread of transmitted particles,

and discharge characteristics of the target are investigated. Partial agreement with experiment is

found.

INTRODUCTION

The transmission of multiply and highly charged ions (HCI) through nanocapillaries has

recently been employed as a tool to study the interaction with surfaces, speciﬁcally, the

internal walls of the capillary. The original motivation was to delineate the initial state

of hollow-atom formation at large distances from the surface [1, 2, 3] information hardly

accessible by scattering at ﬂat surfaces. Image attraction and close collisions tend to erase

the memory on this early state of ion-surface interaction when the ion suﬀers close encounter

as it is either reﬂected from the topmost layer of the surface or penetrates into the bulk. A

previous ﬁrst step to access information on the early stages of the neutralization process was

the usage of “stepped”, or terrace-decorated, surfaces [4]. Capillaries provided an attractive

alternative as the ion can escape the capillary prior to a close encounter with the surface,

the hollow atom can be directly spectroscopically investigated [1, 5]. Initial investigations

focused on metallic capillaries with typical radii of r = 50 to 100 nm (“nanocapillaries”)

and a length L of about one µm, thus featuring an aspect ratio of the order of 1:20 and

geometric opening angles θ0 < 3◦. Incidence angles θin larger than θ0 therefore necessarily

lead to the impact of all projectiles on the surface and, consequently, to the destruction of

the hollow atom (or hollow ion).

More recently, capillaries through insulating foils (PET or “Mylar”, [6]) and SiO2 [7] with

aspect ratios

1 : 100 have been studied in several laboratories [8, 9, 10]. Unexpectedly,

∼

considerable transmission probabilities for projectiles in their initial charge state were mea-

sured for incidence angles as large as

20◦. Apparently, ions are guided along the capillary

∼

axis with a spread (FWHM) of ∆θout of several degrees for mylar [6] but close to geometric

opening θ0 for SiO2 [8]. Keeping the initial charge state, contrary to the expected neutral-

ization upon approach of the internal capillary surface, suggests that the ions bounce oﬀ the
walls at distances larger than the critical distance Rc ≈
workfunction of capillary). Key to this process is the charging up of the internal insulator

walls due to preceding ion impacts. Ion guiding through the capillary ensues as soon as a

dynamical equilibrium of self-organized charge up by the ion beam, charge relaxation, and

reﬂection is established.

A theoretical description and simulation of this process poses a considerable challenge in

view of the widely disparate time scales simultaneously present in this problem:

1. The microscopic charge-up and charge hopping due to the impact of individual ion

impact takes place on a time scale of sub-f s to f s with typical hopping time τh < 10−15

s.

2. The transmission time τt of a projectile ion through the capillary for typical ion energies

of

200 eV/u is of the order of τt ≈

≈

10−10 s.

3. Typical average time intervals ∆t between two subsequent transmission (or impact)

events in the same capillary are, for present experimental current densities of nA/mm2

of the order of ∆t

0.1 s.

≈

reach days.

4. Characteristic (bulk) discharge times τb for these highly insulating materials, can be
estimated from conductivity data [11] to typically exceed τb & 103 s and can even

As this multi-scale problem spans a remarkable 18 orders of magnitude, a fully microscopic

ab initio simulation covering all relevant scales is undoubtedly out of reach. The more modest

goal of the present approach is therefore to develop a simulation that allows to interrelate

the microscopic description of ion-surface impact with macroscopic properties of charge-up

and transport. Aim is therefore to employ in our simulation only parameters that are not

freely adjustable but can, at least as far as their order magnitude is concerned, be deduced

from data for macroscopic material properties of the nanocapillary material. Speciﬁcally,

the bulk discharge time τb as well surface charge diﬀusion constant Ds will be estimated

from surface and bulk conductivity data for mylar [11].

The present approach represent a mean-ﬁeld classical transport theory [12] based on a

microscopic classical-trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) simulation for the ion transported,

self-consistently coupled to the charge-up of and charge diﬀusion near the internal capillary

walls. As a limiting case we also consider a simpliﬁed rate-equation approach. We ﬁnd

partial agreement with experimental data. We conclude this paper by pointing to future

experimental and theoretical challenges to be overcome.

FIG. 1: Ion-nanocapillary interaction, schematically: array of nanocapillaries oriented along the

surface normal with close-up of an individual capillary. An insulating material (PET) with di-

electric constant ε is covered on both sides with gold layers (dark shaded) preventing charge up

of the target during experiment. Capillaries with radius a = 50 nm and L = 10 µm are typically

D = 500 nm apart. Projectiles enter and exit the capillary under angles θin and θout with respect

to the capillary axis. The capillary axis is either normal to the surface or Gaussian distributed

with ∆θa . 2◦ (FWHM).

II. METHOD OF SIMULATION

A. The Scenario

The simulations presented below incorporate the features of the following underlying

scenario: an ensemble of ions of charge state Q are incident relative to the surface normal

of the nanocapillary foil with angle θin. The axis of the capillary with radius a is assumed

to be either aligned with the surface normal (Fig. 1) or Gaussian distributed around the

orientation of the normal with width ∆θa. The lateral inter-capillary spacing D is of the

order of D

10 a such that, on an atomic level, inter-capillary interaction eﬀects can be

≈

neglected. Mesoscopic ﬁeld eﬀects resulting from the charge-up of the ensemble of capillaries

will, however, be taken into account. The entrance and exit surfaces are covered by a 30

nm metallic gold layer in order to avoid macroscopic charge-up of the capillary foil. The

insulating material on the inside is characterized by a dielectric constant ε = 3.3. In view

of the low projectile velocities vp for which guiding is studied, vp . 0.1 a.u., the static limit

ε(ω

0) = ε of the dielectric function ε(ω) is appropriate to characterize the linear response.

will eventually experience close encounters with the surface. Therefore, the eﬀective angle for

transmission would be smaller than given by Eq. 2, unless guiding eﬀects become operational.

Ions reaching the surface will undergo a charge transfer sequence yielding a neutralized

projectile and deposite a number Qef f of positive charges with Qef f & Q at the surface.

In our simulation, we use Qef f = Q for the microscopic charge up per ion impact at the

capillary wall above all because the secondary electron emission coeﬃcient γ for impact of

slow ions at insulator surfaces is small γ . 1 [9]. We have, however, tested the inﬂuence

of larger γ by performing simulations in which up to 2Q positive charges and Q electrons

with energies up to 50 eV were produced. Trajectories of the latter were followed and these

electrons were allowed to neutralize positive charges on the capillary wall. No signiﬁcant

diﬀerences between simulations for diﬀerent γ could be found.

The charged-up micro-patch will undergo surface diﬀusion with diﬀusion constant Ds as

well diﬀusion into the bulk with diﬀusion constant Db. Bulk diﬀusion is extremely slow

for highly insulating materials while the surface diﬀusion towards the grounded metallic

layers will be a factor

100 faster, thus governing the overall discharge process. Self-

The non-trivial aspect of this classical-trajectory Monte Carlo simulation is that memory

the mean ﬁeld Fmean. It furthermore depends on the surface and bulk diﬀusion constants

Ds,b of the material. By deducing values for Ds,b from macroscopic conductivity data and

considering them to be independent from the stage of charge-up, we treat the discharge

process in linear response, i.e. we neglect non-linear processes discussed recently [13, 14, 15].

Details of the determination of V will be discussed below.

Solving Eqs. 4 and 5 is, while straight-forward in principle, quite demanding in view

of the disparate time scales and ensemble sizes involved. We have therefore developed an

algorithm that approaches the accuracy of conventional Runge-Kutta methods while con-

siderably increasing the computing eﬃciency. First, the capillary is divided into three-sided

prisms which are further subdivided into three tetrahedrons (see Fig. 2). The force (Eq. 5) is

calculated before the simulation of a given trajectory only at the corners of the tetrahedrons.

The starting point of the trajectory is determined from a uniform probability distribution

over the entrance surface of the capillary, the entrance angle θin is selected from a Gaussian

distribution centered around the nominal entrance angle. Its full width at half maximum

mined and, as the last step, the exit point is derived from the analytical propagation of

the trajectory within the tetrahedron. This exit point becomes the starting point of the

trajectory within the next tetrahedron and so forth (see Fig. 2). From comparison between

our method and a fourth-order Runge-Kutta simulation we have determined the optimal

size of the tetrahedrons. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant speed-up (up to a factor 100) while preserving

accuracy to a good degree of approximation.

The propagation of the trajectory is stopped if one of the following two requirements is

met: Either the projectile reaches the exit surface of the capillary at which point the exit

angle for this trajectory is calculated and the transmission probability of the ensemble is

updated or the trajectory is not suﬃciently deﬂected by the ﬁeld of surface charges and

hits the surface. The point of impact is determined and serves as starting point of the

simultaneously performed calculation of the charge diﬀusion. Diﬀusion of the deposited

Q charges is determined for a time interval ∆t between two the subsequent trajectories

(n, n + 1) enter the same capillary m. We have performed simulations both for Poissonian

distributed intervals with mean ∆t as well as for ﬁxed intervals ∆t = ∆t. The results are

indistinguishable which is not surprising as ∆t is 9 orders of magnitude larger than τt.

C. Calculations of the Fields Inside the Capillaries

The forces governing Eq. 5 are determined from the electric ﬁelds ~F resulting from the

charge-up as well as the image ﬁeld.

with ~Fim given by Eq. 1, ~Fcoul represents the electric ﬁeld due to the charge-up of the wall
of the mth capillary, and ~Fmean is the mesoscopic ﬁeld resulting from the charge-up of the

entire ensemble of capillaries.

Calculation of the charge distribution makes use of the macroscopic properties of these

highly insulating materials [11]. Starting point is the bulk conductivity of Mylar σb ∼=
10−16 Ω−1m−1. The surface conductivity σs is larger by a factor of about 100 [11]. From the

diﬀusion will be key for the understanding of the charge-up and discharge characteristics.

The point to be noted is that for such low conductivities and large uncertainties in the

eﬀective number of carriers present, Eq. 8 can only serve for an order of magnitude estimate.

We will later check on the consistency of these estimates by comparison with results of our

simulation. After deposition of Q charges per impact, charges are assumed to undergo an

unbiased random walk resulting in the diﬀusive spread of the charges. For simplicity and to

avoid the introduction of any free parameter, modiﬁcation of the random walk by mutual

Coulomb repulsion is neglected. Accordingly, the probability distribution for the charge

distribution in the surface a time interval ∆t after impact is given by [17]

where ρ is the distance on the surface. Likewise, the distribution for bulk diﬀusion in 3D is

discharging at the boundary to the metallic layer, we treat surface diﬀusion explicitly using

get simultaneously charged-up, they generate a mesoscopic electric ﬁeld that is aligned along

the capillary axis. Due to the large distance of the charge patches near the entry side from

the exit surface (

10 µ m) the ensemble can be viewed as a charged condenser consisting of

≈

two metallic plates (the gold layers) with a dielectric material characterized by the dielectric

constant ε in between (Fig. 1). The mean ﬁeld can be estimated from the total charge

deposited on the capillary walls, the dielectric constant of the insulating material, and the

irradiated target area.

We have performed simulations of the potential and ﬁeld ~Fmean near the exit surface

using the program POISSON/SUPERFISH [18]. Equipotential lines from these calculations

are shown in Fig. 3. For eﬃcient implementation into the classical transport simulation
we also developed a simpliﬁed analytic model for ~Fmean. To this end, the exit plane of

the capillary is approximated by a inﬁnitely thin metal plate with a hole of radius a. For

III. RESULTS

A. Transmission function for ion guiding

Following the pioneering work of Stolterfoht et al. [6] several groups studied the ion

guiding through Mylar (PET) [8, 9, 10] and SiO2 nanocapillaries [7]. Key ﬁnding is the

build-up of a self-organized charge distribution that enables the collision-free transmission.

Patterns of the self-organized charge distribution are shown in Fig. 4. While Fig. 4a shows a

typical charge-up condition leading to blocking (electrostatic “bottleneck”), Fig. 4b displays

a distribution giving rise to guiding. The bottleneck condition was realized by setting Ds

to be equal to the bulk values of Db, corresponding to a slow overall discharge time set here
to be τb ≃
[6] for the time interval over which recharging after beam switch-oﬀ could be realized. Only

35 min. In fact, such a slow discharge time has been suggested by experiment

in the simultaneous presence of both fast (via surface transport, Ds) and slow decay (via

bulk transport Db) can guiding be established and maintained. When taking into account

both surface and bulk diﬀusion, assumptions about a non-linear discharging characteristics

[13, 14, 15] need not to be invoked.

The resulting transmission probability as a function of the angle of incidence relative

to the capillary axis (Fig. 5) displays signiﬁcant transmission for angles well outside the

geometric opening angle θ0. The quantitative agreement with the experimental transmission

function is reasonably good considering the discrepancies between diﬀerent data sets. The

latter is, in part, due to the extraordinarily long bulk discharge times (from Db estimated

to be in the range of hours) which makes measurements under reproducible conditions of

complete initial discharge a challenge.

results at θin = 0◦.

B. Angular distributions

The two-dimensional angular distribution of the guided ions displays anisotropic struc-

tures (Fig. 6) in the θx–θy plane where θx is the angle relative to the capillary axis in the

“scattering plane”, the plane spanned by the incident velocity vector and the capillary axis

while θy is the angle perpendicular to the scattering plane. The θy distribution normal to the

plane of incidence remains almost constant for all angles. Parallel to the plane of incidence

(θx) broadening and displacement of the peak from the center of the distribution is found.

This is in agreement with experiments which show a small deviation of the centroid of the

scattering distributions towards larger scattering angles for large incidence angles θin [6]. At

certain incidence angles (e.g. 3◦) structures in the distribution (solid lines in Fig. 6) become

visible which qualitatively agrees with recent experimental ﬁndings [9]. From the simulation

we can delineate the origin of the second maximum as being due to the formation of a small

secondary charge patch close to the exit surface which deﬂects projectiles passing by at close

distance. We point out that double peak structures are stable under variation of Ds and the

capillary length L although they appear at diﬀerent angles θin. It remains to be investigated

to what extent double peaks in the data are non-accidental and can be taken as evidence

for patch formation near the exit surface.

The simulated transient discharge behavior for 3 keV Ne7+ with θin = 1◦ and θin = 5◦ is

shown in Fig. 9. It is probed by ﬁrst switching oﬀ the ion beam at t = t0 and switching it

on again after a time interval δt = t

t0 for a suﬃciently short time interval in order not

to disturb the discharge process. Data points are normalized to the transition rate at t = t0

and represent an average transmission over 10 capillaries.

The charging and discharging behavior can be described in terms of a simple analytic

rate equation model which is a generalization of the model proposed in [13, 14]. To this

end we approximate the full surface diﬀusion including the charge absorption at the nearby

gold layer by an eﬀective surface discharge time which we estimate, in analogy to the bulk

discharge time (see Eq. 11), by

τs = a2/Ds .

(19)

The apparent τs is expected to depend on the angle of incidence θin. On the one hand, the

extension of the charge patch from the gold layer at the entrance scales as

to be deﬂected along the capillary axis. The latter requirement is directly reﬂected in the

later onset of transmission for θin = 5◦ as compared to the switch-on in the case of θin = 1◦

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a simulation for ion guiding through insulating nanocapillaries within

the framework of a mean-ﬁeld classical transport theory. We combine a microscopic trajec-

tory simulation with macroscopic material properties for bulk an surface conductivities of

highly insulating materials (PET, “Mylar”). Projectiles hitting the inner wall of the insulat-

ing material in the early stage of the irradiation deposit their charge on the capillary surface.

These charges diﬀuse along the surface and, eventually, into the bulk due to the small but

ﬁnite surface and bulk conductivities of the insulator. Projectiles entering the capillary at

a later stage are deﬂected by the Coulomb ﬁeld of a self-organized charge patch close to the

entrance of the capillary. Invoking this scenario we are able to reproduce a range of exper-

imental ﬁndings, e.g., ion guiding even for large incidence angles, the temporal decrease of

transmission during beam-oﬀ times, and, in part, a relatively large angular spread of the

transmitted beam. We have shown, that these results can be interpreted on the basis of a

linear model including transport of deposited charges along the surface without resorting to

freely adjustable parameters. Future investigations should address the dependence on ma-

terial properties. In particular, measurements for other insulating materials (SiO2) should

provide for benchmark data and critical tests for the theoretical framework presented here.

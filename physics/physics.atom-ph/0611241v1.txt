Abstract

Testing extra dimensions at low-energies may lead to interesting eﬀects. In this
work a test point charge is taken to move uniformly in the 3-dimensional subspace
of a (3+n)-brane embedded in a (3+n+1)-space with n compact and one warped
inﬁnite spatial extra dimensions. We found that the electromagnetic potentials of
the point charge match standard Liennard-Wiechert’s at large distances but diﬀer
from them close to it. These are ﬁnite at the position of the charge and produce ﬁnite
self-energies. We also studied a localized Hydrogen atom and take the deviation from
the standard Coulomb potential as a perturbation. This produces a Lamb shift that
is compared with known experimental data to set bounds for the parameter of the
model. This work provides details and extends results reported in a previous Letter.
Keywords: Brane worlds, Liennard-Wiechert, Hydrogen atom, Point charges.

1 Introduction

Spacetimes with more than three spatial dimensions have been attracting interest for long

time. First proposals go back to Kaluza and Klein [1], in their attempt to unify electro-

magnetism with Einstein gravity by proposing a theory with a compact ﬁfth dimension

of a size of the order of the Planck length. Later on the emphasis shifted to a “brane

world” picture [2, 3, 4] with our world being conﬁned to a subspace of higher-dimensional

spacetime. More recently it was put forward, inspired also in [5, 6], that at energy scales of

the Standard Model matter cannot propagate into extra dimensions whilst gravity on the

other hand can permeate all over. Within brane worlds extra dimensions may be compact

but large [7, 8, 9], or inﬁnite and warped [10, 11]. They have opened a rich and interest-

ing phenomenological model-building aiming at solving long standing problems like the

hierarchy and cosmological constant problem within high-energy physics [12, 13, 14], as

well as testing models with observational data at the cosmological level [15].

We should stress at this point that to implement the brane scenario one looks for

physical mechanisms which localize higher dimensional ﬁelds to a lower dimensional brane.

Localization of gauge ﬁelds has turned out to be more diﬃcult than that of scalar and

spinors, however, some mechanisms have been developed in [16, 17, 18, 19]. The one in

[16] is a particularly simple scenario that was probed to localize electromagnetic ﬁelds.

It consists of a single (3+n)-brane embedded in a (3+n+1)-dimensional space containing

n compact extra dimensions and one inﬁnite and warped. This is a (5+n)-dimensional

brane world that we refer to as a Randall-Sundrum II model modiﬁed by n extra compact

dimensions (RSIIn). As for fermions some mechanisms have been developed in [20, 21,

22, 23, 24]. We shall combine some of these ideas for our purposes below.

It is generally assumed within brane models that relevant eﬀects appear at high ener-

gies [12, 13, 14] whereas low-energy eﬀects have no chance to become relevant. This is not

necessarily the case since some high-precision tests may be sensible to such tiny eﬀects or

else, at worst, it may be possible to set bounds for the diﬀerent parameters of the models

[25, 26, 27]. In this paper we investigate two low-energy eﬀects for RSIIn. The ﬁrst one

involves determining the electromagnetic potentials of point charge in uniform motion

in a 3-dimensional subspace of the single (3+n)-brane. Considering that experiments in

2

atomic physics are sensitive to small frecuency shifts down to 1 mHz [25, 26], one can in

principle use the atom as an instrument to measure the anti-de Sitter radius ǫ. The second

problem we investigate is a Hydrogen atom, localized on the brane, where the binding

electromagnetic ﬁeld is just the one obtained in the ﬁrst part. We have calculated the
2S1/2 −
to the Lamb shift associated to QED. This has allowed us to set bounds for the parameter

2P1/2 splitting coming from the presence of the extra dimensions that corresponds

of the scenario, namely the anti-de Sitter radius or, equivalently, the tension of the brane.

In the present work we provide details and extend some of the results of a previous Letter

The paper is organized as follows. In section II we describe the RSIIn brane world

and describe the localization mechanism for the electromagnetic and spinor ﬁelds. Section

III is devoted to calculate the eﬀective electromagnetic potentials for a test point charge

in uniform motion thus providing details and generalizing the static results of [28]. In
section IV the 2S1/2 −
Finally in section V we focus on the discussion of our results as well as some perspectives.

2P1/2 shift of a localized Hydrogen atom is calculated completely.

2 The scenario RSIIn

Now we describe the brane world we use in the present work. Looking for a localization

mechanism for gauge ﬁelds as due to the gravity associated with the brane it was proved

in [16] that the following setting would accomplish such task: A single (3+n)-brane em-

bedded in a (3+n+1)-dimensional space so that space-time is (5 + n)dimensional with n

compact dimensions and one inﬁnite and warped. We call such a scenario RSIIn. Much as

in the case of the Randall-Sundrum models to solve Einstein equations the brane tension

and the negative bulk cosmological constant must be ﬁne-tuned. The resulting metric is

[28].

Since our purpose is to study low energy-physics eﬀects and hence the situation where

electromagnetic ﬁelds and spinors are localized to a 3-dimensional subspace of the (3+n)-

brane we next describe how this works in RSIIn.

2.1 Localization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld

There has been extensive discussion about the localization of gauge ﬁelds in brane-worlds

[16, 17, 19]. Here we just reproduce the proposal in [16] for the RSIIn scenario. Consider

a gauge ﬁeld AM , with action

For low-energies, hence Ri small, and in the background (1), we truncate this action to

the zero Kaluza-Klein modes of the compact n dimensions. The eﬀective 4-dimensional

electromagnetic action turns out to be

Hence Aµ is normalizable, up to a normalization factor proportional to

electrodynamics on it becomes 4-dimensional at large distances l >> Ri. We proceed next

n
ǫ . If n = 0
1 the gauge ﬁeld localizes on the brane and

p

to discuss the spinor localization in RSIIn.

2.2 Localization of spinors

As in the case of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in RSIIn, the observed 4-dimensional ﬁelds

are the zero modes of higher dimensional ones. For explicit calculations we shall be con-

sidering n=1,2, namely 6- and 7-dimensional spacetime unless we specify otherwise, and

hence 8-component spinors. The analysis should hold with the adequate generalizations

4

for arbitrary n. We combine the localization mechanism of [22] designed to work in 5-

dimensional spacetime for massive fermions with the projection analysis of [23, 29] that

allows one to identify 4-component spinors out of the higher dimensional ones.

To begin with a domain wall is considered to be produced by some scalar ﬁeld χ. The

domain wall separates two regions in the non-compact extra dimension y. Explicitly the

v, y < 0 separates from χ = v, y > 0. One introduces a Yukawa coupling
region χ =
between the spinor and the scalar gχ ¯ψψ. For a given sign of the Yukawa coupling g the

−

zero modes have chirality deﬁned. In general there is no dependence on the details of the

proﬁle of the scalar ﬁeld across the wall. It turns out to be convenient to organize the
chiral spinors into one ﬁeld Ψ. The mass term is given by µ ¯Ψτ1Ψ. At low-energies, and
hence small Ri, we truncate this action to the zero Kaluza-Klein modes of the compact n

dimensions. The resulting fermion action reads, after an adequate internal rotation [16],

Since the details of the proﬁle of the scalar ﬁled across the wall play no role for the

localization of ﬁelds, we use an inﬁnitely thin wall approximation. In this limit one has

gχ(y) = gvsign(y). The components ΩA are given in terms of the frames components

Because of the presence of φ(x), from the point of view of 3-dimensional space, the spinor

represents a quantum point-like particle. Now, the fundamental representation for Ψ

corresponds to the eigenvalues +1 and

Overall, for a given scalar ﬁeld fulﬁlling the conditions above, that is to say gv > 1/2ǫ, it is

possible to envisage a long life-time for the spinor to be localized on the brane. We assume

this is the case and hence the role of the extra dimensions in RSIIn at low-energies for a

localized Hydrogen atom we are interested in is reduced to an eﬀective electromagnetic

potential for a point-like proton which we describe in the following section.

3 Liennard-Wiechert potentials for a point particle

As a ﬁrst step in the calculation of the energy levels corrections for Hydrogen atoms one

has to ﬁnd the eﬀective electrostatic potential that replaces the Coulomb potential. In

[28] we have presented the electrostatic potential produced by a point charge localized in

the single brane. A uniformly moving 4D point charge source will be considered as follows

√gjµ = σ(5+n) vµδ3(~x

~x(t))δ(y

y(t)) ,

−

−

~x(t) = ~vt ,

y(t) = ζ .

(18)

(19)

(20)

Here σ(5+n) is the charge density and vµ is the velocity of the source and ζ is a parameter

that turns out to be useful in regularizing a delta product later on so we are interested

at the end in the limit ζ

0. For completeness we brieﬂy recall the calculation leading

term containing ∂µ ˆAµ is pure gauge on the brane so we just drop it from now on. One
now proceeds to solve (21) using the Green’s function approach, which satisﬁes

Here the ﬁrst term is the contribution of the zero mode, m = 0, the second term comes

Our electrostatic potentials for n = 1, 2 are consistent with the Coulomb potential

at long distances and they preserve spherical symmetry. Remarkably these electrostatic

potentials are ﬁnite at the position of the charge. See Fig. (1). The ﬁnite character of

our eﬀective electrostatics potentials allows to maintain the idea of an eﬀective 3D point

particle.

atom caused by the existence of extra dimensions in RSIIn. The eﬀective four-dimensional

Now we are ready to compare the 2S1/2-2P1/2 energy shift for Hydrogen in the presence

of n compact and one warped extra dimensions with the QED Lamb shift. Namely, by

assuming a null result from the experiment that could be directly associated to the extra

dimensions we have [30, 32]

∆E(n) < ∆ELamb ,

(71)

and with the use of the explicit formulae obtained above we can estimate bounds for ǫ.

Notice this has the advantage with respect the use for comparison of the uncertainty in

the measurement that one does not need to consider other important eﬀects as the charge

14m, 10−

5 Discussion

In this work we have investigated low-energy eﬀects associated to the presence of extra

dimensions. The brane world considered here is a Randall-Sundrum like containing a

(3 + n)-brane embedded in a (3 + n + 1) space with n compact and one warped inﬁ-

nite extra dimensions or RSIIn. Apart from its hybrid character having both compact

and non-compact extra dimensions this model is interesting because it localizes the zero

mode gauge ﬁeld due to the presence of the compact dimensions [16]. The eﬀects we

have considered are i) the eﬀective electromagnetic potentials of a point charge moving

uniformly along the non compact directions of the (3 + n)-brane and ii) the Lamb shift

for a Hydrogen atom localized in the same subspace.

We took a test point charge as seen from the 4D spacetime perspective, moving uni-

formly along a timelike straight geodesic spatially contained along the non compact di-

rections of the (3 + n)-brane. Some comments regarding the stability of such geodesic are

in order. Although unstable such geodesics are interesting whenever the tunneling time

into the extra dimensions is large enough. As it is clear from our discussion above for the

spinor localization based on [22] for RSIIn this can be the case quantum mechanically.

It has also been proved for other similar scenarios in [33]. Thus it is reasonable to think

in terms of a semiclassical approximation leading to such a tunneling eﬀect with long

life-time for our uniformly moving particle. We assume then that our description of the

classical test charge is the leading order of the corresponding semiclassical approximation

for the quantum situation. Moreover, at high enough energies, a particle gets excited

along the compact extra dimensions and in this case the instability of the geodesic is

removed.

18

Our results summarize as follows. At low energies our point charge in uniform motion

produces electromagnetic potentials given by the zero mode regarding the compact extra

dimensions but include light massive modes associated to the non-compact dimension.

They reduce to the standard Liennard-Wiechert potentials in 4D Minkowski spacetime

at long distances, as determined by the characteristic scale of the scenario ǫ. Remarkably

below this scale they diﬀer from the standard ones and become ﬁnite at the position of the

point charge. They can easily be seen to produce ﬁnite self energies for the point particles

tempting to explain the ﬁniteness of the electromagnetic potentials and self energy due

to the fact that our charge looks point-like in 3D but it is actually eﬀectively smeared

along the compact extra dimensions at low energies due to the zero mode approximation

in the compact dimensions for the electromagnetic ﬁelds. Indeed as R

0 in (45) and

(48) such ﬁniteness is lost. However it must be observed that for ﬁnite R actually the

standard divergences for the Coulomb potential and self-energy are regained in the limit

→

ǫ

→

0. So the ﬁniteness is better described as a combined eﬀect of the presence of the

compact and warped extra dimensions. Indeed not having compact dimensions amounts

to an impossibility of localizing the particle’s electromagnetic ﬁeld to the brane.

As for the Hydrogen atom model we take a Dirac equation in RSIIn for which we have

adopted the localization mechanism of the spinor as given in [19, 22, 23]. Here we pick the

zero mode in both compact and non-compact extra dimensions for the localized spinor and

couple it with the static form of the time component of the eﬀective Liennard-Wiechert

potential we have determined in the present work, Eqs. (45) and (48). For the static case

the eﬀective potential can be seen as diﬀering from the standard 4D Coulomb potential

by an additive term containing a diﬀerent power of the spatial separation between the

point like charges. The power depends upon the number n of compact extra dimensions.

By making use of a perturbation analysis in terms of this deviation from the Coulomb

perimental Lamb shift data ∆ELamb/h = 1057845.0(9.0)kHz [31]. Assuming the eﬀect
of the extra dimensions ∆E(n) is smaller than the Lambs’s ∆ELamb yields the bounds to
13m for n = 1, 2, respectively. Notice

the length scale of the scenario: ǫ < 10−

14m, 10−

we estimated such bounds by comparing it with the Lamb shift itself and not with the

experimental uncertainty in its measurement. So no other eﬀects like the charge radius of

the proton or the recoil eﬀect, among others, are relevant since they are indeed less than
∆ELamb. Of course one could insist on using such uncertainty but no signiﬁcant improve-

ment is obtained because although the bounds improve one has then to incorporate the

afore mentioned extra eﬀects that essentially cancel the improvement. Furthermore our

upper bounds for ǫ lie in the fermi range so no conﬂict with macroscopic electromagnetism

tests is expected. To go beyond such scale say scattering experiments one would actually

require a quantum ﬁeld approach or QED on RSIIn which remains an interesting open

problem.

physics.

Overall both of our results add evidence on how known low-energy phenomena can be

used to probe models with extra dimensions that were originally thought to be testable

only at high energies while being automatically compatible with standard low-energy

Remarkably, ﬁniteness of the electromagnetic potentials and self-energy has led in the

past to new ideas as for instance the proposal that gravity regulates the self-energy of a

point particle [34] or a non linear electrodynamics of Born and Infeld [35] implementing

the ﬁniteness of the electric ﬁeld [35]. In light of our results it would be of interest to study

other singular problems in standard electrodynamics as the radiation reaction problem.

In this regard higher dimensional ﬂat spacetimes have been considered [36, 37] but curved

hybrid scenarios like RSIIn have not to the best of our knowledge. As for the quantum

extensions it would be interesting to study further the ﬁnite character we have found here

for the potentials and self-energy of a point charge quantum mechanically and its possible

standard model [39, 40] to see whether they may add something to realistic brane world

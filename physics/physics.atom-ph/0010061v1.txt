Abstract

The ﬁrst three dynamic multipole polarizabilities for the ground state of hydrogen, helium,
hydride ion, and positronium hydride PsH have been computed using the variational Monte
Carlo (VMC) method and explicitly correlated wave functions. Results for the static dipole
polarizability by means of the diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method and the ﬁnite ﬁeld ap-
proach show the VMC results to be quite accurate. From these dynamic polarizabilities van der
Waals dispersion coeﬃcients for the interaction of PsH with ordinary electronic systems can be
computed, allowing one to predict the dispersion energy for the interaction between PsH and
less exotic atoms and molecules.

While experimentalists relay everyday on positrons and positronium atoms (Ps) to collect informa-
tion about microscopic features of macroscopic systems like solutions, polymers and crystals, much
less eﬀort has been devoted to the theoretical understanding of the complex interactions that take
place between ordinary matter and positrons. Among the explored avenues of this ﬁeld, we mention
the interest in predicting the stability of classes of compounds like e+M and MPs [1-9], where M
represents an atomic or molecular system, and the calculation of the cross sections in the scattering
process of e+ and Ps on a molecule or an atom [10-16].

On the contrary, the evaluation of the interaction energy between e+M or MPs and a molecule
or atom is an almost unexplored issue [17]. We believe this fact is primarily due to the need of
a very accurate trial wave function to describe correctly the correlated motions of electrons and
positrons. So far, only variational calculations with explicitly correlated Gaussians (ECG) [1, 5] or
Hylleraas-type functions
[7-9], and the DMC method [2-4] have shown to be able to adequately
recover the correlation energy in positron-containing systems.

Related to the calculation of the interaction energies is the calculation of second order properties
of positron-containing systems, a problem whose surface has been barely scratched in the past
[6]. These properties, speciﬁcally the dynamic polarizabilities, are strictly related to the van der
Waals coeﬃcients that describe the long range interaction between systems [18], representing a way
to tackle the problem of the asymptotic intermolecular interactions. Recently, Caﬀarel and Hess
showed that these properties can be computed by means of quantum Monte Carlo simulations [19]
connecting the imaginary-time-dependent dynamics of the unperturbed system with the transition
probabilities of a reference diﬀusion process. In this work we apply a modiﬁed version of their method
to compute dynamic multipole polarizabilities for PsH, H, He, and H− as a way to understand the
behaviour of these systems when interacting with an external ﬁeld, and as a ﬁrst step towards the
deﬁnition of the interaction potential between PsH and the ordinary matter.

As far as we know, the work by Le Sech and Silvi

[6] is the only one reporting calculations on
the eﬀect of a constant electric ﬁeld on PsH. In that work they computed both the static dipole
polarizability, 123 a.u., and the behaviour of the annihilation rate Γ2γ versus the intensity of the ﬁeld
employing explicitly correlated wave functions, numerical integration, and a variation-perturbation
approach. As by-product of our calculations of the potential energy curve of the e+LiH system [20],
we obtained an estimation of the static dipole polarizability of 49(2) a.u., a value quite diﬀerent from
the one computed by Le Sech and Silvi. Since we believe this diﬀerence to be too large to admit an
explanation based on the diﬀerent accuracy of the methods used to compute this value, we plan to
solve this puzzle in this work.

In the method by Caﬀarel and Hess [19] the frequency-dependent second order correction to the
ground state energy is written as a sum of the two time-centered autocorrelation functions of the
perturbing potential V

Caﬀarel and Hess

[19] showed that it is possible to compute CV V (t) employing an optimized
trial wave function and the pure-diﬀusion Monte Carlo (PDMC) method, an alternative algorithm
to the commonly used DMC with branching, where each walker explicitly carries its own weight
along all the simulation [21].

In their work on He and H2, Caﬀarel, R´erat, and Pouchan [22] reported that the autocorrelation
function CV V (t) becomes dominated by the noise at large times, and this fact might be due to the
ﬂuctuations of the walker weights that increase during a PDMC simulation, while the value of the
autocorrelation function itself becomes smaller. While the second eﬀect is intrinsic to the stochastic

2

method, the ﬁrst can be reduced employing a more accurate trial wave function that is able to
reduce the weight ﬂuctuations. Another possibility, giving up the exactness of the method (i.e. not
sampling the exact Ψ2
0), is represented by the sampling of a quite accurate trial wave function without
carrying around the weight for each walker, a method we call Perturbation Theory variational Monte
Carlo (PT-VMC). This algorithm can be useful for those systems whose autocorrelation function
has a large decaying time, as the case of H− and PsH. This large decaying time will increase the
ﬂuctuations of the carried weights, and hence the statistical noise in the autocorrelation functions
in the long-time region.

As a test of the correctness of our computer program and of the accuracy of the method, we
computed the ﬁrst three autocorrelation functions, and hence the dynamic polarizabilities up to the
octupolar one, for the two systems H and He. The analytical forms of the perturbing potentials were
taken from Ref.
[22]. While for H we employed the exact ground state wave function and compared
with the analytic values of the multipole polarizability [18], for the He case we used a 25 term
Hylleraas-type wave function optimized by means of the standard energy minimization [23]. We
ﬁtted the numerical CV V (t) results of our simulations with a linear combination of three exponential
functions

CV V (t) ≃

in order to have an analytical representation of the autocorrelation functions at all the times. Since
it is important to reproduce accurately the long time behaviour of CV V , the smallest λi in Eq. 3
was independently calculated ﬁtting ln [CV V ] in the long time region with a ﬁrst order polynomial.
This choice was found to improve sensibly the goodness of the total ﬁtting in this time range.

These analytical representations of CV V allow us to compute easily the integrals in Eq. 1 and to
obtain simple expressions of α(ω). The parameters obtained by the ﬁtting procedure are available
from the authors upon requests.

For both systems we found excellent agreement of the static polarizabilities (H αdip =4.495 au,
αquad =15.034 au, αoct =133.105 au; He αdip =1.382 au, αquad =2.401 au, αoct =10.367 au) with
the exact results for H [18], with PDMC results by Caﬀarel, R´erat, and Pouchan [22], with Glover
and Weinhold upper and lower bounds for He [24], and with the accurate results by Yan et al.
[25].
At this point we would like to stress that, although in the PT-VMC method the walkers carry
always a unitary weight because the branching process is absent, similarly to the PDMC method
the time step has to be chosen short enough to produce only a small time step bias. For these
two systems we found the time step of 0.01 hartree−1 to be adequate to compute statistically exact
results.

As a check of the ability of the PT-VMC method to compute polarizabilities also for highly
polarizable systems whose exact wave function is more diﬀuse than the one of He and H, we selected
the hydride ion as test case. For this system we optimized a 5 term Hylleraas-type wave function
whose average properties are shown in Table 1 together with the accurate results obtained in Ref.
[26]. Table 1 contains also the multipole static polarizabilities computed in this work employing a
time step of 0.01 hartree−1, and the static polarizability computed by Glover and Weinhold [24].
Comparing the mean values in Table 1, one can notice that our 5 term wave function gives lower
values than the ones obtained in Ref.
[26] except for hr−i. This fact may explain the underestimation
of the αdip by PT-VMC, that recovers 92(2) percent of the accurate value. Nevertheless, this result
represents a fairly good estimation of the static dipole polarizability for H−, a quantity that appears
diﬃcult to compute even with more complex approaches [27].

As far as PsH is concerned, we computed the autocorrelation functions using two diﬀerent trial
wave functions, including one (Ψ1
T ) terms [3]. The choice of two trial wave functions
to guide the Langevin dynamics was aimed at testing the dependency of CV V (t) on the quality of
the wave function itself.

Employing the PT-VMC method and our wave functions for PsH, we computed the autocorre-

lation functions for three perturbation potentials:

where the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the two electrons, while the subscript p indicates the positron.
These potentials are the cartesian forms of the dipole, quadrupole, and octupole moment operators
for the PsH system. Figure 1 shows the averaged correlation functions for V1, V2, and V3 as obtained
by the VMC method employing the 28 term trial wave function. Each value of the correlation
functions was computed employing roughly 1010 conﬁgurations. From Figure 1 one can note the eﬀect
at large evolution times of the dispersion of the “trajectories” used to compute the autocorrelation
function. This eﬀect makes diﬃcult the reproduction of the long-time regime of these functions due to
the exponential decay and the roughly constant statistical error introduced by the method. Moreover,
the statistical error strongly depends on the perturbation potential whose autocorrelation function
is computed, i.e., more speciﬁcally on the dispersion of its mean value over the Ψ2

T distribution.

The results for the static multipole polarizabilities, i.e.

for ω = 0, computed with both trial
wave functions, are shown in Table 2. While for the dipole polarizabilities there is a good agreement
between the two values, larger diﬀerences are present for the higher multipole polarizabilities. This
fact is an indication of the diﬀerent accuracy of the two functions in approximating the exact wave
function at large distances from the nucleus.
In fact it can be shown that if one approximates
the autocorrelation functions taking care only of the excitation to the ﬁrst state of the appropriate
i i − hVii2, where Vi is the perturbing
symmetry, the autocorrelation function is proportional to hV 2
potential. Comparing the dipole results with the value obtained by Le Sech and Silvi
[6], again
the large diﬀerence of the computed polarizabilities is apparent. As a ﬁnal check for this problem,
we computed the energy of the PsH when immersed in a weak static electric ﬁeld F by means of
standard DMC simulations adding the linear potential F (x1 + x2 − xp). To make our simulations
stable, i.e. to avoid the dissociation of the PsH, we truncated the eﬀect of the linear potential at
|xi| = 15 bohr. We ﬁtted the DMC results by means of the simple polynomial a − αdipF 2/2, where
αdip is the static dipole polarizability, obtaining αdip = 42.3(8) a.u. We believe that this result,
statistically indistinguishable from the αdip obtained by the PT-VMC method, gives the deﬁnitive
answer to the problem of the PsH polarizability. Nevertheless, the discrepancy between our PT-
VMC and DMC αdip and the one computed by Le Sech and Silvi
In our
experience [3], to compute the matrix elements they needed, millions of conﬁgurations must be
used even for systems like PsH to avoid to be fooled by a false convergence. Unfortunately, Le Sech
and Silvi did not report any information about the number of conﬁgurations they used to compute
the integrals, so we cannot judge the numerical accuracy of their results.

[6] remains puzzling.

An attempt to estimate the total accuracy of our α results can be made comparing the polariz-
ability values obtained by the two wave functions. These diﬀer by 10 percent at most, a value that
we feel might give a conservative estimate of the relative errors for the higher multipolar ﬁelds.

As stated previously, although dynamical polarizabilities are interesting on their own, they repre-
sent the basis to compute van der Waals dispersion coeﬃcients for the interaction between diﬀerent
systems. Therefore, following Ref.
[25], we present the calculation of the C6, C8, and C10 dispersion
coeﬃcients between H, He, and PsH as a ﬁrst eﬀort to obtain accurate information on the interac-
tion between positronic systems and ordinary matter in the framework of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation and second-order perturbation theory.

Using the ﬁtted parameters for H, He, and PsH we computed the coeﬃcients for the interaction
between the ordinary systems and between these and PsH. The values are reported in Table 3. Since
the values for the H-H, H-He, and He-He coeﬃcients are accurately known [25], we use them as a
test of the accuracy of our approach: all the values diﬀer from the accurate results by Yan et al.
[25] at most by one part over hundreds.

Comparing the Cn’s for the ordinary systems with the ones for the interaction with PsH, it strikes
that these last are more than an order of magnitude larger than the formers. These features, due
to the larger PsH polarizability, indicates that positronic systems strongly interact with ordinary
matter even at large distances. Unfortunately, nothing can be said about location and depth of
the total potential minimum. This strongly depends also on the eﬀect of the repulsion between the
positron cloud and the H and He nuclei, so that we believe a supermolecule approach is needed.
In a previous work [17] we computed the interaction energy between H and PsH, showing that
this system could have a metastable state. Although the dispersion coeﬃcients for the interaction
between He and PsH are smaller than those for PsH and H, they might be large enough to give rise
to a potential well that could support at least a stable state. If this turns out to be the case, the
He-PsH system could be the lightest van der Waals (i.e. bound by means of dispersion forces) stable
dimer.

In this paper we have tried to establish a theory for angular correlation between the photo- and Auger electrons in the
two-step double photoionization of a rare gas atom. The basic ﬁnding of this paper is that a general theoretical expression for
the angular correlation function is established in the problem of double photoionization of atoms in the presence of linearly
polarized monochromatic light. We consider the case of a xenon atom and the incident light is of 94.5 eV with arbitrary linear
polarization. The theoretical results are compared with the experiments done by K¨ammerling and Schmidt [J.Phys.B, 26,
1141(1993)].

In a recent paper we gave a theory for angular correlation in the double photoionization (DPI) of a rare gas atom [1]. We
took DPI to be a two step process [2]. The atom is irradiated by a beam of unpolarized photons and emits a photo-electron.
This is the ﬁrst step. After a ﬁnite time interval the singly ionized atom de-excites by emitting an Auger electron. The time
delay between the two steps decouples them energetically. However, the angular momenta of the photo-electron and the Auger
electron interact to yield their ﬁnal angular correlation. We deﬁned the angular correlation W as a function of θ, the angle
between the directions of emission of the two electrons.

The object of the present paper is to obtain a general expression for the angular correlation function for DPI of a rare gas
atom due to a linearly polarized photon beam described by Stokes parameters S1, S2 and S3 [3]. The atom is initially randomly
oriented, but becomes aligned after the absorption of a photon. It is also energetically excited, and emits a photo-electron from
10−18 sec. The singly ionized atom with an inner
one of its inner shells. The photo-electron leaves the interaction region in
shell vacancy will now tend to de-excite by emitting an Auger electron from one of the outer shells [4]. A typical Auger lifetime
of say the xenon (Z = 54) O-shell is

−15 sec. The photo- and Auger ionizations are thus widely separated in time.

We now come to the basic problem of calculating the angular correlation between the photo-electron and the Auger electron.
In a natural way, we can deﬁne the angular correlation function W (θ) to be the probability that the angle between their directions
of emission is θ. On what factors should it depend, and how can we formulate a general approach to its investigation? The
following points may be noted.
(i) Obviously, W (θ) should be independent of the choice of coordinates, because basically it is a function of the angle θ. This
calls for a tensor formalism.
(ii) Since W has the nature of a probability, we can only evaluate it by counting the number of coincident events in which the
angle between the directions of emission has a particular value θ, and so on. Thus the question arises of a set of detectors which
can concurrently detect the photo-electron and the Auger electron. In other words, we have to deﬁne a detection operator to
describe such operations quantum mechanically.
(iii) The detectors may or may not be completely dependable in actual practice. This raises the question of eﬃciency of a
particular detector.
(iv) Thus we can think of two kinds of quantum mechanical operators to describe our problem: (a) a density operator ρ which
describes the probability of occurrence of an electron in a particular state, and (b) an eﬃciency operator ε which describes the
probability that our detector will actually detect the electron in that state.

∼

We can thus visualize the angular correlation function as a scaler which is simply related to the product of the two tensor
operators ρ and ε as deﬁned above. Evidently a contraction of these tensor operators will be called for to give the scaler W (θ).
One virtue of this theory is that we are invoking the statistical properties of a complete ensemble and no perturbation series
of any kind is involved.

Let us now look a little more carefully at the angular correlation function W (θ). When we say that it is the probability that
the angle between the directions of emission of the two electrons is θ, we actually mean two things. (i) The two electrons are
in states which are compatible with their directions of emission making an angle θ with each other, and (ii) the eﬃciencies of
the two electron detectors are such that the angle between the directions of emission may be inferred to be θ. Taking these two
factors into account we deﬁne

In DPI experiments, a Cylindrical Mirror Analyser (CMA) is used for detection and energy analysis of the electrons. It

imparts to the electron a cylindrical symmetry regardless of its angle of incidence with respect to the axis.

As for the orbital angular momentum of the incident photo- or Auger electron, this is ﬁxed by arranging to receive only
those incident electrons which have the characteristic energy. This implies that the detector is receiving all the photo- or
Auger electrons, as the case may be, having the characteristic energy and orbital angular momentum. In other words, the
CMA is acting not only as a diﬀerential energy analyser, but also as an angle-integrated device. For a given orbital angular
momentum which labels a photo- or Auger electron, the conjugate angle of incidence becomes completely indeterminate. It is
this indeterminacy which gives a statistical character to the distribution of the two electrons. That in its turn manifests itself
in their angular correlation.

We decompose the density matrix [5] of the photo-absorbed rare gas atom in terms of the density matrix of the unobserved
doubly ionized state and of the two continuum electrons. The choice of detectors is discussed in detail in reference [6]. The
expression for the eﬃciency tensor component is

Since the residual doubly ionized state is unobserved we can write

We have calculated the theoretical values of the angular correlation function for two possible cases. The electric ﬁeld vector
is along the x axis and a perpendicular plane geometry is used to describe the process. We choose the collision frame x, y, z
attached to the sample and the z axis coincides with the direction of incident the photon beam. Since the Stokes parameters
S1 and S2 refer to the same quantity, but with diﬀerently oriented axes, one can take S2 = 0. This is done by selecting the x
axis of the collision frame to coincide with the direction of maximum linear polarization, i.e. the major axis of the polarization
ellipse. The same polar and azimuthal angles are chosen in the experiment. Here e1 and e2 are the directions of propagation of
the photo-electron and the Auger electron respectively. (i) The photo-electron is observed in a ﬁxed direction and the Auger
electron spectrometer is turned around to get the angular distribution of the Auger electron with respect to the photo-electron.
Here the maximum allowed value of k is 2j2. This is our ﬁrst case. (ii) The second case is the complementary case i.e. the Auger
electron is observed in a ﬁxed direction and the photo-electron spectrometer is turned around to get the angular distribution
of the photo-electron with respect to the Auger electron. Here the maximum allowed value of k is 2j1,max. This value gives the
highest order of the Legendre polynomials occurring in the correlation function.

The angular correlation function in DPI due to polarized photons now becomes

i) Case 1 : the photo-electron is observed in a ﬁxed direction and the Auger electron spectrometer is turned around to get the
angular distribution of the Auger electron with respect to the photo-electron,

W (θ)

1 + 1.314P2(cos θ) + 1.100P4(cos θ) .

∼

ii) Case 2 : the Auger electron is observed in a ﬁxed direction and the photo-electron spectrometer is turned around to get the
angular distribution of the photo-electron with respect to the Auger electron,

W (θ)

1 + 0.817P2(cos θ) + 0.602P4(cos θ) + 0.570P6(cos θ) .

∼

If the incident photon is unpolarized Eq.(5) reduces to Eq.(25) of reference [1].

The solid line in the ﬁgures represents the theoretical curve and the dotted points are experimental values of W (θ). Fig 1
gives the polar plot of the angular correlation function for unpolarized photons. Figures 2 and 3 for linearly polarized photons.

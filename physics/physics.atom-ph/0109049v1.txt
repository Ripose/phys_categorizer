We present a detailed experimental study of a three-
dimensional lin⊥lin bright optical lattice. Measurements of
the atomic temperature and spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcients are
reported for diﬀerent angles between the lattice beams, i.e.
for diﬀerent lattice constants. The experimental ﬁndings are
interpretated with the help of numerical simulations. In par-
ticular we show, both experimentally and theoretically, that
the temperature is independent of the lattice constant.

I. INTRODUCTION

The spatial modulation of the intensity or polarization
of laser beams leads to cooling and trapping of atoms
[1,2]. In the case of a periodic spatial modulation of the
light, the trapping of atoms results in their localization
in a periodic structure, called optical lattice [3,4].

Near-resonant bright optical lattices, the ones consid-
ered in this work, are based on the Sisyphus cooling
mechanism [2,5]. The periodic modulation of the light
polarization, produced by the interference of several laser
beams, leads to a periodic modulation of the light shifts
(optical potentials) of the diﬀerent Zeeman sublevels of
the ground state of the atom. As a result of the optical
pumping between diﬀerent optical potentials, atoms are
cooled and ﬁnally trapped at the potential minima.

The lin⊥lin conﬁguration, which corresponds to a Sisy-
phus cooling, and the σ+ − σ− one have been the ﬁrst
laser cooling schemes leading to sub-Doppler tempera-
tures [2]. Therefore much experimental and theoretical
work has been done on these cooling schemes, and many
temperature measurements have been reported. How-
ever the majority of the experimental data corresponds to
1D conﬁgurations or to 3D optical molasses produced by
six phase-uncontrolled laser beams [6]. A much smaller
amount of experimental data is available for 3D optical
lattices, as obtained by the interference of four phase-
uncontrolled laser beams [7]. Besides the early studies
by our group [4], temperature measurements for a four-
beam 3D lattice have been done at NIST [8] and later on
by the Kastberg’s group [9,10]. In these works the tem-
perature of the atoms in a lattice with ﬁxed geometry
was studied as a function of the atom-light interaction
parameters (laser intensity and detuning, corresponding
to diﬀerent depths of the potential well and diﬀerent op-
tical pumping rates). No attention was payed to depen-

1

dencies of the temperature on geometrical parameters as
the lattice constants, which can be varied by changing
the angles between the lattice beams. That is one of the
issues analyzed in the present work.

Another aspect of optical lattices relatively unexplored
is the diﬀusive atomic dynamics. That will be the sec-
ond issue analyzed in this work. In a bright optical lat-
tice, as obtained with a laser ﬁeld red detuned from a
Fg = F → Fe = F + 1 transition, atoms at the bot-
tom of a potential well strongly interact with the light
and therefore undergo ﬂuorescence cycles. This produces
complex transport phenomena which have not yet been
completely understood. Two diﬀerent mechanisms may
lead to spatial diﬀusion. First, the optical pumping may
transfer an atom from a potential well to a neighbour-
ing one corresponding to a diﬀerent optical potential, as
shown in Fig. 1. Second, atoms are heated as result of
the recoil associated to the ﬂuorescence cycles. Thus, the
increase in kinetic energy following many ﬂuorescence cy-
cles may allow the atom to leave the potential well. In
this case the atomic diﬀusion is not associated to optical
pumping between diﬀerent ground state sublevels.

There has already been a few investigations devoted
to the study of spatial diﬀusion in optical molasses and
bright optical lattices [11–15]. In Refs. [11–14] the atomic
transport and spatial diﬀusion has been studied by a di-
rect imaging of the expansion of the atomic cloud. A
completely diﬀerent approach has been followed in Ref.
[15] where both the atomic dynamics in a single potential
well and the atomic transport in the lattice have been
studied through polarization-selective intensity correla-
tion spectroscopy.

This work is organized as follows.

In this work we present a detailed experimental study
of the temperature and spatial diﬀusion of 85Rb atoms
cooled in a 3D lin⊥lin bright optical lattice. Measure-
ments for diﬀerent angles between the lattice beams, i.e.
for diﬀerent lattice constants, are presented. The experi-
mental results are compared with numerical simulations.
In Section II we
describe the experimental set-up. Section III contains
the results of the temperature measurements obtained
by recoil-induced resonances and the corresponding nu-
merically calculated values. In Section IV we present our
results for the measurement of the spatial diﬀusion co-
eﬃcients by direct imaging of the atomic cloud and we
compare them with the numerical simulations. Finally,
in Section V we present the conclusions of our work.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP

The preparation of the atoms in the optical lattice is
the standard one used in previous experiments [7]. The
rubidium atoms are cooled and trapped in a magneto-
optical trap (MOT). Then the MOT magnetic ﬁeld and
laser beams are turned oﬀ and the atoms are cooled and
trapped in the optical lattice. The periodic structure
is determined by the interference of four linearly polar-
ized laser beams, arranged as shown in Fig. 2: two y-
polarized beams, symmetrically disposed with respect to
the z axis, propagate in the xOz plane with a relative
angle 2θx, while two x-polarized beams, also symmetri-
cally disposed with respect to the z axis, propagate in
the yOz plane and form an angle 2θy. As discussed in
Refs. [7,16], this conﬁguration results in a 3D periodic
potential, with minima located on an orthorhombic lat-
tice and associated with pure circular (alternatively σ+
and σ−) polarization.

For the measurements presented in this work, the an-
gles between the lattice beams in the xOz and yOz
planes are equal: θx = θy ≡ θ. This corresponds to
the lattice constants, i.e. to the distance (along a ma-
jor axis) between two sites of equal circular polarization,
λx,y = λ/ sin θ, λz = λ/(2 cos θ), with λ the laser ﬁeld
wavelength. For this conﬁguration with equal angles and
equal intensity laser beams the radiation pressure is bal-
anced.

For the MOT and the lattice we used the Fg = 3 →
Fe = 4 D2 line transition of 85Rb. A repumping beam
resonant to the Fg = 2 → Fe = 3 transition is also added.

III. TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS

We measured the temperature of the atomic sample
after a 20 ms cooling phase in the optical lattice by
using the method of recoil-induced resonances [17–19].
Once the lattice beams are turned oﬀ, two additional
laser beams (the pump and the probe beams, see Fig. 2)
are introduced for the temperature measurements. They
cross the atomic sample in the xOz plane, and they are
symmetrically disposed with respect to the z axis form-
ing an angle of 230. The probe transmission is moni-
tored as a function of the detuning between the pump
and probe ﬁelds. For equal pump and probe polariza-
tions, the states |α, pi and |α, p′i with the same internal
quantum number α but diﬀerent atomic momentum are
coupled by Raman transitions. The diﬀerence in popula-
tion of these states determines the absorption or gain of
the probe, and the probe transmission spectrum results
to be proportional to the derivative of the atomic momen-
tum distribution. From the width of the resonance in the
probe transmission spectrum it is then straighforward to
derive the atomic temperature [18]. The geometry of our
pump and probe ﬁelds corresponds to measurement of
the temperature in the x direction [20].

Results of our measurements for the temperature as a
function of the lattice beam intensity at diﬀerent values
of the lattice detuning and for diﬀerent choices of the
lattice angle θ are shown in Fig. 3.

We observe a linear dependence of the temperature
with the laser intensity, with a d´ecrochage at small inten-
sities, in agreement with theoretical models and previous
measurements [9,10].

As an original result, on the basis of the measurement
reported in Fig. 3, we ﬁnd that the temperature is inde-
pendent of the angle between the lattice beams, i.e. of the
lattice constant. However, this behaviour, independent
of the lattice constant, is speciﬁc of the temperature and
we should not conclude that the atomic dynamics does
not depend on the lattice constants. In fact, as we will
show in the following, other quantities, such as the spa-
tial diﬀusion coeﬃcients, show a strong dependence on
the angle between the lattice beams.

We also studied the temperature of the atomic sam-
ple as a function of the lattice detuning ∆, for diﬀerent
for diﬀerent val-
depths of the potential well U0, i.e.
′
0 (U0 is proportional
ues of the light shift per beam ∆
′
0). Results of our measurements are shown in Fig.
to ∆
4. We conclude that the temperature depends on the
depth of the potential well only, and not on the lattice
detuning, except for an increase at small detunings. We
have also performed a theoretical study with the help of
semi-classical Monte Carlo simulations [21]. Taking ad-
vantage of the symmetry between the x and y directions
(see Fig. 2), we restricted the atomic dynamics in the
xOz plane. The numerical calculations in this restricted
conﬁguration give the same dependencies of the dynami-
cal quantities on the lattice parameters as full 3D calcu-
lations, so they are useful to interpret the experimental
results. However, a direct quantitative comparison is not
necessarily meaningful because the restriction of the dy-
namics to two dimensions may introduce scaling factors
(see [21] for more details).

We considered 1/2 → 3/2 atoms, as customary in nu-
merical analyses of Sisyphus cooling. Because the exter-
nal degrees of freedom of the atoms are treated as classi-
cal variables, it is straighforward to calculate the variance
of the atomic momentum distribution, which is propor-
tional to the steady-state temperature in a thermalized
cloud

kBTi =

(i = x, z) ,

(1)

hp2
i i
M

with pi the atomic momentum in the i− direction, M
the atomic mass and kB the Boltzmann constant. We
found results in good agreement with the experimental
ones. In particular, the independence of the temperature
on the lattice angle is well conﬁrmed by the numerical
simulations. The physical picture of Sisyphus cooling
[2] allows an immediate interpretation of this result: an
atom looses kinetic energy until it gets smaller than the
depth of the potential well, independently of the lattice

2

constant. More precisely in the regime considered here
(the jumping regime [2]), the atomic dynamics is well de-
scribed by a brownian motion: an atom undergoes a fric-
tion force Fi = −αivi and a ﬂuctuating force, essentially
produced by the ﬂuctuations of the dipole force, which is
described by the momentum diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dpi in
the i− direction. As shown in Ref. [21], αi and Dpi are
proportional to 1/λ2
i in a domain where the spontaneous
emission can be neglected. Hence, the temperature, given
by the Einstein relation kBTi = Dpi /αi, is independent
of the lattice constants.

The increase of the temperature at small lattice detun-
ing is also present in our numerical results. As the laser
frequency gets close to the atomic resonance the momen-
tum diﬀusion corresponding to multiple atomic recoils
increases while the friction coeﬃcient associated to the
Sisyphus cooling decreases [2]. As a result, at small lat-
tice detuning the equilibrium temperature increases ap-
proaching the atomic resonance. We veriﬁed this point by
arbitrarily removing the corresponding term in the sim-
ulation. Then, no increase of the temperature at small
detuning appeared.

IV. MEASUREMENT OF THE SPATIAL
DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS

We now turn to the study of spatial diﬀusion. We
observed the atomic cloud expansion by using a Charge
Coupled Device (CCD) camera. We took images of the
expanding cloud at diﬀerent instants after the atoms have
been loaded into the optical lattice. The exposure lasts
1 ms and we took an image every 7 ms. Since we wanted
to explore regions of large detuning and low intensity for
the lattice beams, we increased to maximum the lattice
beams intensity while imaging the atomic cloud to in-
crease the brightness of the image. Of course, the atomic
dynamics was aﬀected during the imaging and we took
only an image for every realization of the diﬀusion. Since
the x and y directions are equivalent in our lattice, we
choose to take images in a plane containing the z axis and
forming an angle of 45o with the x and y axis (ξ axis).
Fig. 5 shows typical images of the expanding cloud.

We veriﬁed that the proﬁle of the atomic cloud is well
approximated by a gaussian function (Fig. 5, right).
From the images of the atomic cloud we derived the
atomic mean square displacements h∆z2i and h∆ξ2i. As
evidenced by the plots of Fig. 6, the cloud expansion
corresponds to a normal diﬀusion, i.e. the mean square
atomic displacement increases linearly with time.

From data as those of Fig. 6 we have been able to
derive the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcients Dz and Dξ in the
z- and ξ-directions by ﬁtting the experimental data with

h∆x2

i i = 2Dit

(i = z, ξ) .

(2)

We determined the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcients as a func-
tion of the lattice beam intensity for diﬀerent values of

the laser detuning and lattice constant. Our results are
shown in Fig. 7.

It appears that Dξ is an increasing function of the lat-
tice intensity. On the other hand, the experimental data
do not show a clear general dependence of Dz on the laser
intensity.

As an important fact, we observe that Dξ is a decreas-
ing function of the angle θ between the lattice beams.
This supports the picture of the atomic spatial diﬀusion
as produced by optical pumping (see Fig. 1).
Indeed
if we assume that the diﬀusion is produced by the op-
tical pumping between neighbouring wells, the diﬀusion
coeﬃcients (Eq. 2) will be simply proportional to the
pumping rate and to the square of the lattice constant.
As the lattice constant λx,y = λ/ sin θ decreases for in-
creasing θ, the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcients decreases as
a result.

It is diﬃcult to test whether a similar argument applies
also to the diﬀusion in the z direction, as the range of
λz = λ/(2 cos θ) explored experimentally has been quite
small because of practical diﬃculties with lattice beams
with very large or very small angles. However we note
that at large lattice intensity, the spatial diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient in the z− direction increases for increasing λz,
i.e. for increasing θ, as expected. This behaviour is not
observed at small lattice intensity.

In the numerical simulations, we monitored the vari-
ance of the atomic position distribution as a function of
time. We veriﬁed that the spatial diﬀusion is normal, and
determined the diﬀusion coeﬃcients from Eq. 2. The re-
sults of our calculations are shown in Fig. 8.

We note a linear dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cients on the lattice beams intensity, and a d´ecrochage
at small intensity. For the values of lattice intensity at
which this d´ecrochage is observed, the temperature is still
′
in the linear regime (T proportional to ∆
0). This corre-
sponds to a transition to anomalous diﬀusion [22], where
only few atoms, ﬂying over several potential wells, con-
tribute to the diﬀusion process.

In the linear regime, Di is proportional to λ2

i (i = ξ, z),
in agreement with the simple picture presented above and
with the experimental results along the ξ axis. On the
contrary, in the regime of d´ecrochage, the atoms do not
move from a well to a neighbouring one so no variation
of Di proportional to λ2
is expected. Both the exper-
i
imental and theoretical results conﬁrm that Di is not
proportional to λ2

i in this regime.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we studied, experimentally and theoret-
ically, the temperature and the spatial diﬀusion of rubid-
ium atoms cooled in a 3D lin⊥lin optical lattice. The
atomic temperature and the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcients
are studied for diﬀerent angles between the lattice beams,
i.e. for diﬀerent lattice constants. The experimental ﬁnd-

3

ings are interpretated with the help of numerical simula-
tions.

We show, both experimentally and theoretically, that
the temperature is independent of the lattice constants.
This is consistent with a simple physical picture: an atom
looses kinetic energy until it gets smaller than the depth
of the potential well, independently of the lattice con-
stants.

The experimental results for the spatial diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcients show a linear dependence on the lattice beams
intensity, and a d´ecrochage at small
intensity. Both
d´ecrochage and linear regime are conﬁrmed by the nu-
merical simulations. However in the experiment the
d´ecrochage in the diﬀerent directions does not appear at
the same values of lattice parameters, in contrast with
the theoretical predictions. We have not been able to de-
termine with certainty the origin of this discrepancy. The
choice of the 1/2 → 3/2 transition for the numerical sim-
ulations, diﬀerent from the one of the experiment, could
be a source of disagreement between the theoretical re-
sults and the experimental ﬁndings. This point requires
further analysis.

In the linear regime, the numerical simulations show
that the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcient is proportional to
the square of the lattice constant, in agreement with the
picture of atomic diﬀusion produced by optical pump-
ing. Experimental ﬁndings for the diﬀusion coeﬃcients
along the ξ axis and also along the z axis for much higher
intensities that that leading to d´ecrochage conﬁrm the
theoretical predictions.

[20] We note that the temperature in z direction can be diﬀer-
ent from the ones in the (equivalent) x and y directions.
In fact, as it will be discussed in detail in the following,
the temperature depends on the depth of the potential
well. Therefore in the case of anisotropy of the optical
potentials, the temperatures in the diﬀerent directions
are diﬀerent.

FIG. 8. Numerical results for the spatial diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient in the x and z-directions as a function of the light shift
per beam at ﬁxed lattice beam detuning (∆ = −3Γ, with
Γ/2π = 5.9 MHz for 85Rb), i.e. as a function of the lattice
beams intensity. The diﬀerent data sets correspond to diﬀer-
ent lattice angles θ.

Abstract

The propagation of ultracold atomic gases through abruptly changing waveguide potentials is

examined in the limit of non-interacting atoms. Time-independent scattering calculations of mi-

crostructured waveguides with discontinuous changes in the transverse harmonic binding potentials

are used to mimic waveguide perturbations and imperfections. Three basic conﬁgurations are ex-

amined: step-like, barrier-like and well-like with waves incident in the ground mode. At low

energies, the spectra rapidly depart from single-moded, with signiﬁcant transmission and reﬂec-

tion of excited modes. The high-energy limit sees 100% transmission, with the distribution of the

transmitted modes determined simply by the overlap of the mode wave functions and interference.

INTRODUCTION

The manipulation of ultracold matter waves can now, somewhat routinely, be performed

above microchip or magnetized surfaces [1, 2]. In such experiments, the quantum nature of

the dilute atomic gases dominates over the classical, enabling precision matter wave control

[3].

One of the key requirements in using an “atom chip” to perform atom optics is the

ability to transport atoms from one atom optical component to another. Here, we present

calculations of wave propagation through waveguides with idealized perturbations consisting

of sudden changes to the transverse conﬁning potential. An increase (decrease) in the

tranverse conﬁning potential results in a decrease (increase) in the kinetic energy along the

direction of wave propagation, providing eﬀective step potentials along the waveguide.

The present study was motivated in three ways. Firstly, recent experiments have demon-

strated a signiﬁcant fragmentation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a waveguide

located close to the surfaces [4, 5], attributed, at least in part, to imperfections created dur-

ing the wire fabrication processes [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Secondly, to further understand some of the

limitations to designing atom optics devices that are based on variations of the waveguide

potentials, for example, the smoothly varying wide–narrow–wide wire geometry has been

proposed as a quantum-point-contact type device for atoms [11]. Thirdly, the literature has

been lacking a multimode analysis of many of the simplest waveguide geometries, as it has

been experimentally shown that introducing a perturbation in a waveguide can result in the

transverse excitation of a BEC [4].

To characterize the impact of transverse discontinuities, here we explore the Schr¨odinger

wave mechanics of waveguides with step-like, barrier-like and well-like potentials along the

direction of propagation. There have already been some theoretical investigations using time-

dependent calculations of wave propagation through smooth potentials such as a bottleneck

(step-up) and a smooth termination (extreme step-down) in the limit of non-interacting

atoms [12, 13], while non-linear (atom-atom) eﬀects in the bottleneck-type geometry have

also been examined [14, 15]. The advantages in using abrupt potentials whilst neglect-

ing atom-atom interactions is that simple time-independent calculations can be used to

characterize the transmission and reﬂection probabilities. Under these conditions, we have

previously investigated a circular bend [16], which consists of an abrupt transition from the

2

lead waveguides into the bend and at low-energies behaves like a potential well.

Our multimode analysis, restricted as it is to the the linear regime, provides a baseline for

comparison of BEC propagation through quasi-one-dimensional (1-D) waveguides including

the transverse degrees of freedom. For example, previous time-independent studies have

investigated non-linear wave propagation through shallow-well, step and gaussian shaped 1-D

potentials [17, 18, 19, 20]. Such simple waveguide potentials could be generated by modifying

the transverse conﬁnement, where knowledge of the transverse excitation probabilities, in

the abrupt and linear limits, should be useful.

For ground mode matter waves propagating at low energies through the various pertur-

bations, the present results show that the spectra rapidly depart from single-moded, with

signiﬁcant transmission and reﬂection of excited modes. The high-energy limit sees 100%

transmission, and we present a simple model to determine the distribution of the trans-

mitted modes that combines the overlap of the mode wave functions with the multi-path

interference of the modes.

II. DETAILS OF THE CALCULATIONS

There are a number of atom chip wire conﬁgurations that can create waveguides [2,

21], but we follow the theoretical ansatz adopted in Refs. [16, 22]. That is, we assume

that the waveguides consist of an idealized trapping potential that is quadratic near the

minimum and operate at low matter-wave densities such that atom-atom interactions can

be neglected. Furthermore, so that the waveguide potentials reduce to an eﬀective 2D

problem, the waveguides are assumed to be created by multiple wire conﬁgurations with

abrupt changes in the spacing between the wires, such that the height and transverse position

of the potential minima remains constant along the waveguide. The out-of-plane quantum

number is then a conserved quantity.

the lead–barrier–lead transition. The dot-dashed lines correspond to the parity-forbidden levels

(assuming an even incoming mode). All the energies and coordinates are given in terms of oscillator

units for the leads.

The corresponding energy levels of Eq. (1) are shown in Fig. 1(b). These energy levels

behave as eﬀective potentials for the longitudinal motion since we expand the total wavefunc-

tion in each region on the transverse oscillator states. In this model, all coupling between

modes occurs through the matching between regions. The potentials in Eq. (1) are sym-

metric in x so that parity in x is conserved, simplifying the present analysis and discussion

considerably [the dot-dashed lines in Fig. 1(b) are not coupled to the solid lines]. In ex-

periments, imperfections would as likely be oﬀ-center, resulting in populating of all modes

(as was possible in our previous study of the circular bend [16]). The fundamental physics,

however, remains much the same, so we chose to adopt parity-conserving perturbations with

the incoming waves restricted to the ground (even) oscillator mode.

To perform the time-independent scattering calculations we initially adopted the transfer

4

matrix method [23], although most of the calculations reported in this paper use the interface

matching method [16, 23]. The two methods are similar, however, and since the transfer

matrix approach facilitates the discussion of our results, we outline it here. The extension

of the transfer matrix method from one-dimension to include transverse degrees of freedom

is trivial [24, 25], so only a short summary is given here as it applies to a barrier/well-like
geometry of length (z1 −

z0) = l.

Firstly, the time-independent wavefunction is expanded on transverse SHO states, ϕn(x)

for frequencies ωa, and χm(x) for ωb:

overlaps of SHO-functions with diﬀerent frequencies [26, 27] (such overlaps are also found

R

in calculations of transitions between molecular vibrational modes [28]), we performed the

transverse integrations numerically using a B-spline basis.

The scattering solution is obtained by constructing the transfer matrix Q = AB, which
relates one lead’s coeﬃcients, ~a and ~b, to the other’s, ~g and ~h. Given that the wave is

the linear equation ~a = Q11~g is solved, and then ~b = Q21~g. The transmission and reﬂection

There are convergence diﬃculties with the transfer matrix approach, the demonstration

and discussion of which is mostly relegated to the appendix. In brief, the problems are related

to the slow decay of the SHO overlaps O0m with m, which requires the inclusion of strongly

closed channels, leading to the appearance of large exponentials in the transfer matrix. While
the transfer matrix method eliminates the need to ﬁnd intermediate coeﬃcients (ie. ~c and ~d),

it was generally found to be unstable beyond the smallest of the perturbations considered in

this paper. The interface matching method, in contrast, explicitly solves for the intermediate

coeﬃcients and is able to include enough closed channels to ensure near machine-precision

convergence for the range of geometries and energies given in this paper. The transfer matrix

method works well, however, for step-like geometries with a single interface (ie. Q = A) as

there are no exponentials in the matrix elements, and furthermore, all the coeﬃcients are

explicitly solved for.

A.

Interface overlaps

The multimoded transmission and reﬂection probabilities for three basic geometries are

given in this section: the step-like potential, the barrier-like potential and the well-like

potential. The calculations for the step-like potentials use the transfer matrix method,

while interface matching is used for the barrier-like and the well-like potentials. Before

presenting these calculations, it is instructive to discuss how the interface overlaps O0m

The O0m dependence on the frequency ratio ωb/ωa is discussed here since it strongly

inﬂuences the amount of mode excitation caused by the diﬀerent geometries. Using the

orthonormality of the SHO eigenstates, along with the recursion relations of the Hermite

6

polynomials, it can be shown that the overlap integrals of the ωa = 1 ground mode with the

ωb even modes reduce to the particularly simple form:

for all m = 0, 2, 4, 6 . . .. Due to symmetry, O0m = 0 for m = 1, 3, 5 . . .. Eq. (6) was also

obtained by Aslangul [27].

The dependence of the ﬁrst three overlaps (m = 0, 2, 4) on frequency is shown in Fig. 2(a).

At ωb = 1, there is a perfect waveguide match, and we must have O00 = 1 and O0m = 0 for

The slow decay of the overlaps with the higher modes can be seen in Fig. 2(b). This

implies that, even at low energies, many closed channels must be included in the following

calculations to achieve computational convergence.

B. Step-like waveguide potential

The transmission and reﬂection probabilities, Tnf and Rnf , of ground mode plane-waves

traversing four step-like waveguides are shown in Fig. 3. At incident energies below the

lowest reﬂection threshold (E < 2.5, the lowest excited mode energy), the system behaves

like the familiar 1-D step potential. Ground state transmission, T0, remains the dominant

channel across the range of energies shown in Fig. 3(a) (for the range of ωb examined here),

although excited mode transmission can also be seen in Fig. 3(a) as each mode opens.

Signiﬁcant reﬂection is seen into the ground nf = 0 mode in Fig. 3(b), which rapidly drops

oﬀ from threshold. As each reﬂection threshold opens, the reﬂection into the excited modes

nf > 0, seen in Fig. 3(c), ﬁrstly increases then is seen to experience an overall decrease. All

of which are consistent with the Wigner threshold laws for multichannel systems [29].

For incidence in the ground channel, the total transmission approaches 100% in the high

energy limit. In this limit the transmission probability is given simply by

Tnf (E

) =

with the SHO overlaps of Eq. (6). Such projections were introduced as part of the waveg-

uide calculations of J¨a¨askel¨ainen and Stenholm [12, 30], in which the transmission excitation

probabilities generated by both bottleneck and split-potential waveguides were brieﬂy dis-

cussed as the potentials tended towards abrupt. Similar multimode projections have also

been theoretically examined during expansion of a BEC from a microtrap into a waveguide

[15], with an emphasis on the eﬀects of atom-atom interactions.

Equation (7) can be seen as the high-energy limit of the matrix elements of A, given by

Eq. (4). At energies high compared to the step height, the momenta of the lowest few modes
are approximately the same on both sides of the step, κnf ≈
the number of channels involved, the matrix elements that dominate the Q = A transfer

[see Fig. 2(b)]. In this case, these four transmission modes must be open before the high

energy limit [

Tnf = 1, as per Eq. (7)] is reached to within 2%.

Whether the wave is incident from the left or the right, these results apply. The ground

P

mode transmission T0(E) is absolutely identical as a function of total energy E for both the

waveguide constriction (ie. step-up from ωa = 1 to ωb > 1), and the waveguide expansion (ie.

step-down from ωa > 1 to ωb = 1) This results also holds for the familiar 1-D step potential,

and, although we do not show it here, the transmission and reﬂection mode mixing conspires

to ensure this is also the case in the multichannel system. The mode mixing as a function

of E is diﬀerent for either geometry, however, since for the step-up case there can be many

reﬂection channels open at the lowest transmission threshold, E = Eb, while for the step-

down, there can be many transmission channels open at E = Eb. At high energies, neither

of the step geometries generates reﬂection, and for incidence in the ground mode the limits

10

from Eq. (7) apply.

C. Barrier-like waveguide potential

To demonstrate the characteristics of a single barrier-like potential, we consider the case

shown in Fig. 1, for a ﬁxed length l and frequencies that change from ωa = 1 to ωb > ωa

and back to ωa = 1. We also present the high-energy characteristics for scattering from this

potential.

The transmission and reﬂection probabilities for four waveguide constrictions ωb =

1.5,2,3,5 and length l = 10 are shown in Fig. 5. Resonances appear in all of the spec-

symmetry). Above E = 2.5, there is signiﬁcant excited mode transmission [Fig. 5(a)], while

the amount of reﬂection into the ground mode [Fig. 5(b)] and the excited modes [Fig. 5(c)]

is signiﬁcant across the energy range.

To observe the high-energy limit, the results for the ωb = 5 barrier of Fig. 5 were extended

shows that while there is more structure in the reﬂection probabilities than for the step-like

potential in Fig. 4(c), the total amount of reﬂection still tends towards zero as more barrier

modes become open at E/Eb = 5, 9, 13, . . ..

To obtain an expression analogous to Eq. (7), we must take into account the fact that

the transmitted waves going through a barrier experience at least two interface projections

as in Eq. (7). The phases accumulated while propagating the length l of the barrier must

also be included in such a prescription, which suggests that at high energies (relative to the

where m is only summed over the propagating barrier modes. The crosses shown in Fig. 6(a)

demonstrate that the two-mode version of this model does a remarkable job in describing

the transmission probability above the m = 2 barrier threshold (at E/Eb = 5). Depending

on the phase diﬀerences, the modes that are excited at the ﬁrst interface can be converted

back to the ground mode by the second interface. We also noted this behavior in circular

waveguide bends [16], where the amount of excitation could be suppressed by changing the

angle swept out by the bend to the point where the accumulated phase diﬀerence between

the n = 0 and n = 1 modes was a multiple of π. A similar design consideration could

perhaps be useful for atom optics devices such as the quantum point contacts [11], where

any unavoidable – yet unwanted – mode excitations could be minimised by varying the

length between the changes in waveguide potentials.

D. Well-like waveguide potential

The transmission and reﬂection probabilities for well-like waveguides due to a potential

bulge (ωa > ωb) are the focus in this last section. The scattering behavior for a well is

complicated by the presence of bound states which translate into the presence of Feshbach

resonances in a multichannel problem. Much of the resonance physics seen here has been

extensively discussed as part of our studies of the circular waveguide bend [16, 31]. The

propagation thresholds in a bend lie slightly lower than the connecting leads [32, 33], result-

ing in very weakly bound states and energetically narrow resonances. The present well-like

waveguides can provide extreme diﬀerences between the lead and bulge energy thresholds,

and thus the possibility of multiple narrow resonances located below the thresholds.

Two bulges are considered here, the ﬁrst from ωa = 1.5 to ωb = 1 and back to ωa = 1.5,

and the second with ωa = 2 to ωb = 1 and back to ωa = 2. In both cases, we choose ωb = 1

to be the reference oscillator frequency, to simplify the comparison with the barriers in the

previous section. The transmission and reﬂection probabilities of both of these potentials

with well length l = 10 are shown in Fig. 7.

Multiple 100% reﬂection resonances exist at energies below the ﬁrst excited lead mode

energy, ie. below E = 3.75 for ωa = 1.5 and E = 5 for ωa = 2. As was noted in our

circular bend studies [16], the reﬂection resonances below the second excited mode (ie.

below E = 6.75 for ωa = 1.5, and at E = 9 for ωa = 2) do not result in complete reﬂection

due to the reduced coupling between the ground and second excited mode and due to the

existence of alternate pathways to reﬂection.

The high-energy transmission probability asymptotes for the well-like potential are again

given by Eq. (8), although the energy of the ﬁrst excited mode within the well means that the

two-mode model starts at E = 2.5 (in other words, at a lower energy than for the equivalent

barrier-like potential). The two-mode model is shown in Fig. 7(a) for the ωa = 2 well, and is

seen to be a bad approximation near the E = 2.5 threshold due to the signiﬁcant reﬂection

there. The two-mode model generally provides a reasonable approximation at higher energies

once the total reﬂection probability has dropped below the total excited mode transmission

probability, and also when the many narrow reﬂection resonances no longer play a role.

Waveguides with more extreme discontinuities such as ωa = 3 and 5 were also explored.

They exhibit so many resonances across the range of energies shown in Fig. 7, however, that

14

the transmission and reﬂection probabilities essentially become a dense series of closely-

spaced vertical spikes. At energies above the second excited mode threshold (E = 4.5),

there are not so many resonances, although there remains signiﬁcant reﬂection probability.

As an example, the ωa = 5, l = 10, well-like waveguide has a total reﬂection probability at

E = 37.5 (E/Ea = 15) that has only dropped down to about 0.2. This reﬂection probability

can be compared with the ωb = 5, l = 10 barrier-like geometry in Fig. 6(b) at E = 37.5

(E/Eb = 15), where the total reﬂection probability was only about 0.02. In other words,

reﬂections play a far more dominant role for the well-like potentials than the barrier-like.

IV. SUMMARY

Using time-independent solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation, we have explored the

propagation of dilute, ultracold atomic gases through abruptly changing waveguide poten-

tials. Previous studies have discussed the conditions for “adiabatic” waveguide propagation

through microstructures (eg. Refs. [11, 12, 13, 34]). In contrast, the interest here was on

the consequences of sudden potential variations for mode excitation with a view towards

modelling waveguide imperfections, examining the eﬀects of using abrupt potentials in atom

optical devices, and simply to explore the behavior of some simple geometries.

Three idealized geometries with changes in the transverse guiding potential have been

the focus of study: step-like, barrier-like and well-like. The low-energy behavior of all the

geometries departed from single-moded, with the exception of the mildest perturbations at

energies below the lowest excitation threshold. Signiﬁcant generation of both transmission

and reﬂection excited modes was caused by the mismatch of the modes at the interfaces

between the waveguide sections. The strong coupling to excited modes is due to the signiﬁ-

cant overlap of the ground SHO function of one frequency with the excited SHO functions

with a diﬀerent frequency. Certainly, care should be taken during wire fabrication of atom

optical elements to ensure that any deliberate (or not) changes in a waveguides transverse

frequency are not abrupt.

High energy wave propagation through abrupt potentials amounts to 100% wave trans-

mission via projections across each interface, along with multimode interference. The present

SHO-based waveguides behave somewhat diﬀerently than the hard-walled models for ballis-

tic electron propagation through waveguides with a wide-narrow junction (see Ref. [35], and

15

the references thereafter that cite it). In that case an impedence mismatch occurs, where

there is always some amount of reﬂection at high energies due to the fact that the narrow

guide modes can never represent the wide guide modes over the whole width of the lead.

Although, to the best of our knowledge, calculations for such electron waveguides have not

discussed high-energy/abrupt potential transmission and reﬂection limits.

A further condition was suggested for high energy transmission through microstructures

with multiple interfaces to account for the interference between modes. It was shown that

a simple two-mode model can give a reasonable approximation to the amount of ground

mode transmission, and provides an additional consideration for the design of “atom-chip”

waveguides to control single-moded wave-transmission through potentials that generate mul-

timoded excitations.

APPENDIX A: CONVERGENCE OF TRANSFER MATRIX CALCULATIONS

Our transfer matrix program was validated by reproducing the single-mode calculations of

electron propagation through a linear array of 1-D potentials [36], and secondly by comparing

with multi-moded 2-D results from an interface matching program [16].

The multimode transfer matrix method, however, has numerical convergence diﬃculties

as the number of modes included in a calculation increases. This behavior can be seen in

Table I, for scattering with diﬀerent incident energies E oﬀ a barrier-like potential with

ωb/ωa = 2 of length l = 5. The unitarity of the transfer matrix results deviate signiﬁcantly

from

f Tnf + Rnf = 1, even as N is increased. The interface matching calculations are

shown for comparison, and barely suﬀer from the same problems.

In an attempt to rescue the transfer matrix approach, a second method for constructing

the transfer matrix was investigated. This second attempt involved inverting a matrix C,

numerical results of solving Q = AC −1 are also shown in Table I, and while unitarity results

for the single-channel calculation, it is as unstable, if not worse that Q = AB.

For the geometries considered in this paper the transfer matrix approach was not able to

adequately converge over the required range of energies. The exception to this was for the

step-like geometry, where for the most extreme calculations in this paper (Fig. 4: ωb/ωa = 5

and E = 37.5) N = 128 modes could easily be included (since the transfer matrix contains

no exponential terms, and all coeﬃcients are explicitly solved for).

17

We also ﬁnd that, since the Onm overlaps are energy independent, obtaining convergence

is much easier for the present interface matching calculations than for previous circular

waveguide bend calculations using the same method [16, 37]. For the most extreme barrier-

like calculation (Fig. 6: ωb/ωa = 5, l = 10 and E = 37.5), the interface matching method
achieved unitarity to better than 10−10 with N = 96 modes.

Some of the transfer matrix convergence issues were passingly mentioned by Wu et.al [24],

where the transfer matrix method was initially applied to a system of multiple circular bends

(the transfer matrix is simply built as a number of matrix products). In the end, however, the

calculations shown in Ref. [24] were performed using multiple interface matching. We labor

on this point since no such unitarity problems were noted in the multichannel transfer matrix

calculations of Ref. [25], where the examples given were for 2 or 3 channel calculations with

delta potentials. On the other hand, the advantage of the transfer matrix approach is that,

in the single-mode approximation, one can easily obtain the transmission characteristics of

both ﬁnite and inﬁnite length periodic potentials [23, 38].

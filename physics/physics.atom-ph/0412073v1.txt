We measure the lifetime of the 8s level on a magneto-optically trapped sample of 210Fr atoms with
time-correlated single-photon counting. The 7P1/2 state serves as the resonant intermediate level
for two-photon excitation of the 8s level completed with a 1.3 µm laser. Analysis of the ﬂuorescence
decay through the the 7P3/2 level gives 53.30 ± 0.44 ns for the 8s level lifetime.

We present in this letter a measurement of the 8s level
lifetime of francium; the heaviest and most relativistic
of alkali atoms.
It is a test of the modern techniques
of ab initio calculations using many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT) [1, 2]. Fr is yet to be used in Parity
Non-conservation (PNC) measurements [3], but work to-
wards that goal requires the understanding of the ex-
cited state properties of the atom. It is important to en-
sure that our quantitative understanding of the atomic
structure of Fr is as good as that of lighter alkali e.g.
Cs where PNC experiments have achieved resolution to
extract weak force parameters [4]. Quantitative mea-
surements on Fr and comparison with theoretical calcu-
lations validate the same MBPT techniques used for Cs
and other atoms with a more relativistic atom where cor-
relations from the 87 electrons are large. The 8s state is
the preferred candidate for an optical PNC measurement;
the dipole forbidden excitation between the 7S1/2 ground
state and the ﬁrst excited 8S1/2 state, becomes allowed
through the weak interaction.

The lifetime τ of an excited state is determined by its
individual decay rates, 1/τi, through the matrix element
associated with the i partial decay rate. The connections
between lifetime, partial decay rates and matrix elements
are:

where ω is the transition energy divided by ~, c is the
speed of light, α is the ﬁne-structure constant, J ′ and J
are respectively, the initial and ﬁnal state angular mo-
menta, and |hJkrkJ ′i| is the reduced matrix element [5].
Equation 1 links the lifetime of an excited state to the
electronic wavefunctions of the atom. The comparison of
measurements with theoretical predictions test the qual-
ity of the computed wavefunctions specially at large dis-
tances from the nucleus due to the presence of the radial
operator.

The lifetimes of the low lying states in Fr are reaching
a level of precision comparable to that of the other alkalis
[5, 6, 7]. The atomic theory calculations for these tran-
sitions [8, 9, 10] predict the lifetimemes measured with

impressive agreement, strengthening the possibility of a
PNC experiment in a chain of francium isotopes.

We use the method of time correlated single photon
counting to obtain the lifetime of the 8s level in Fr in a
magneto-optical trap (MOT). We populate the 8s level
with a two photon transition, then we turn oﬀ the excita-
tion suddenly and observe the exponential decay through
the ﬂuorescence photons [11].

The production, cooling and trapping of Fr on-line
with the superconducting linear accelerator at Stony
Brook has been described previously [12]. Brieﬂy, a 100
MeV beam of 18O ions from the accelerator impinges on
a gold target to make 210Fr (radioactive half life 3 min).
We extract ∼1×106 francium ions/s out of the gold and
transport them 15 m to a cold yttrium neutralizer where
we accumulate the Fr atoms. We then close the trap with
the neutralizer and heat it for one second (∼1000 K) to
release the atoms into the dry-ﬁlm coated glass cell where
they are cooled and trapped in a MOT. The cycle of ac-
cumulating and trapping repeats every 20 s.

Figure 1 shows the states of 210Fr relevant for trapping
and lifetime measurements. A Coherent 899-21 titanium-
sapphire (Ti:Sapph) laser operating at 718 nm excites
the trapping and cooling transition (7S1/2, F = 13/2 →
7P3/2, F = 15/2). A Coherent 899-21 Ti:Sapph laser
operating at 817 nm repumps any atoms that leak out of
the cooling cycle via the 7S1/2, F = 11/2 → 7P1/2, F =
13/2 transition. The ﬁrst photon for the 7S1/2 → 8S1/2
transition comes from a Coherent 899-01 Ti:Sapph at 817
nm, it populates the 7P1/2, F = 13/2 state. The second
photon at 1.3 µm originates from an EOSI 2010 diode
laser to excite the 7P1/2 → 8S1/2 transition.

A Burleigh WA-1500 wavemeter monitors the wave-
length of all lasers to about ±0.001 cm−1. We lock the
trap, ﬁrst photon and repumper lasers with a transfer
lock [13], while we lock the second photon laser with the
aid of a Michelson interferometer that is itself locked to
the frequency stabilized HeNe laser used in the transfer
lock.

The MOT consists of three pairs of retro-reﬂected
beams, each with 15 mW/cm2 intensity, 3 cm diameter
(1/e intensity) and red detuned 31 MHz from the atomic

resonance. A pair of coils generates a magnetic ﬁeld gra-
dient of 9 G/cm. We work with traps of ≈ 104 atoms, a
temperature lower than 300 µK, with a diameter of 0.5
mm and a typical lifetime between 5 and 10 s.

Figure 2 displays the timing sequence for the excita-
tion and decay cycle for the measurement. Both lasers
of the two photon excitation are on for 50 ns before they
are switched oﬀ, while the counting electronics are sensi-
tive for 500 ns to record the excitation and decay signal.
The trap laser turns oﬀ 500 ns before the two-photon
excitation. We repeat the cycle at 100 KHz.

We turn the trap light on and oﬀ with an electro op-
tic modulator (EOM) (Gs¨anger LM0202) and an acousto
optic modulator (AOM) (Crystal Technology 3200-144).
The combination of the two gives an extinction ratio of
better than 1600:1 after 500 ns. AOMs modulate the
repumper and the ﬁrst photon (817 nm) light (Crystal
Technology 3200), they have extinction ratios of 109:1
and 26:1 30 ns after the pulse turns oﬀ respectively. We
couple the 1.3 µm laser into a single mode optical ﬁber
pass it through a 10 Gbits/s lithium niobate electro-optic
ﬁber modulator (Lucent Technologies 2623N), then am-
plify it (Iphenix IPSAD1301) and again modulate it with
a second electro-optic ﬁber modulator (Lucent Technolo-
gies 2623N); the result is an on-oﬀ ratio of better than
1000:1 in a time of 20 ns.

A 1:1 imaging system (f/3.9) collects the ﬂuorescence
photons onto a charge coupled device (CCD) camera
(Roper Scientiﬁc, MicroMax 1300YHS-DIF). We moni-
tor the trap with the use of an interference ﬁlter at 718
nm in front of the camera. A beam-splitter in the imag-
ing system sends 50% of the light onto a photo multiplier

tube (PMT) (Hamamatsu R636). An interference ﬁlter
at 718 nm in front of the PMT reduces the background
light other than ﬂuorescence from the cascade through
the 7P3/2 level decay back to the ground state 7S1/2.

After we turn oﬀ the excitation lasers, the atom re-
turns back to the ground level using two diﬀerent decay
channels (see Fig. 1): First, by emitting a 1.3 µm photon
it decays back to the 7P1/2 state and ﬂuoresces 817 nm
light to return to the 7s ground level. The second possi-
ble decay channel is the 8s → 7P3/2 transition followed
by the decay to the 7s ground level. The 1.7 µm ﬂuo-
rescence from the ﬁrst step of this decay is unobserved,
but we detect 718 nm light from the second part of the
decay. With the known lifetime of the 7P3/2 state, it is
possible to extract the 8s level lifetime from the cascade
ﬂuorescence decay.

We amplify (Ortec AN106/N) the current pulses from
the photon detections in the PMT. We gate (EG&G
LG101/N) and send them to a constant fraction discrim-
inator (Ortec 934). The output starts a gated time-to-
amplitude converter (TAC) (Ortec 467) that we stop with
a ﬁxed time delay pulse after the two-photon excitation.
We use a multichannel analyzer (MCA) (EG&G Trump-
8k) to produce a histogram of the events showing directly
the exponential decay. A pulse generator provides the
primary timing sequence for the measurement (Berkeley
Nucleonics Corporation BNC 8010).

We take sets of data for about 1500 s, that are individ-
ually processed, and ﬁtted. The total number of counts
in a set is typically in the order of 3×105. Figure 3 shows
the accumulated decay of a set of data, together with the
exponential ﬁt and the residuals.

We apply a pile-up correction, that accounts for the
preferential counting of early events [14]. As low count
rates keep this correction small, we collect data with a
small number of ﬂuorescence photons. We typically count
one photon every 500 cycles. The correction alters the
ﬁtted lifetime by +0.1%. We perform a nonlinear least
square ﬁt and use an iterative algorithm to ﬁnd the ﬁtting
parameters that produce the smallest χ2.

The decay signal S8s through the 7P3/2 state is a sum
of two exponentials [7] and a background AB with a slope
AS, from the turn oﬀ of the trap. The ﬁtting function is:

where τ7p is the known lifetime of the 7P3/2 state and τ8s,
AB, A8s and A7p are the ﬁtting constants. Figure 3 shows
an example of a data set and the ﬁt. We start the ﬁt 20
ns after both excitation lasers are turned oﬀ. The ﬁtting
function describes the data well, and the reduced χ2
ν of
this particular decay is 1.11. A discrete Fourier transform
of the residuals shows no structure. The average χ2
ν for all
the data ﬁles used to obtain the lifetime is 1.07 ± 0.07. A
change (within our quoted uncertainty) on the calibration
of the linearity of the MCA is responsible for deviation
from unity of the reduced chi squared. The slope that we
ﬁnd is 0.02 counts in 500 channels for a counting time of
1 second and it is the remanent of the trap light. A ﬁt
to a ﬁle consisting of the sum of all ﬁles gives consistent
results both for the 8s lifetime and for the 7P3/2 lifetime
when this last one is left as a free parameter.

We calculate the contribution to the uncertainty in the
8s lifetime from the 7P3/2 lifetime of 21.02(11) ns [6]
using Bayesian statistics [7]. The 7P3/2 state gives a
Bayesian error of 0.15%.

We do not observe any systematic eﬀects depending
on the start and end points of the ﬁt, the so called trun-
cation error, beyond the statistical uncertainty. We look
for eﬀects in the lifetime from imperfect lasers turn oﬀ by
leaving the ﬁrst photon on continuously. The change in
the lifetime with the ﬁrst photon oﬀ or continuously on
during the decay constraints the uncertainty from imper-
fect lasers turn oﬀ to ±0.07 %. The time calibration of
the pulse detection system contributes ±0.01 % to the un-
certainty. The TAC and MCA nonuniformity contribute
±0.11 % error in the 8s level lifetime and increases the
value of the χ2
ν.

We study the eﬀect of the initial state conditions on
the obtained lifetime by changing external parameters of
the measurement. We vary the power of the 817 nm ﬁrst
photon laser and we observe no change in the measured
lifetime. The time of ﬂight of the atoms can inﬂuence the
measured 8s level as excited atoms may leave the imag-
ing region before they ﬂuoresce. However, the average
velocity of the atoms in the MOT is less than 0.1 m/s
and the imaging region has a diameter of 1 mm. The
time it takes the atoms to traverse the imaging region is
approximately 105 times the measured 8s level lifetime.
The slope in the ﬁtting function inﬂuences the value of
the obtained lifetime. Files with and without the second
photon that produces the background exponential decay
give a consistent slope. We compare the lifetime obtained
by leaving the slope as a free parameter or by ﬁxing it
to the background ﬁles value and obtain an uncertainty
contribution of ±0.36 %.

The counting PMT is continuously on and detects light
from both the two photon excitation and the ﬂuorescence
light from the MOT. We bound the possible saturation
eﬀects on the PMT by comparing the average response
of the PMT in photon counting mode with the response
of a fast photodiode not subject to saturation. W e ﬁnd
a maximum contribution of ±0.24% to the overall uncer-
tainty from the PMT recovery.

We search for other possible systematic eﬀects in the
lifetime of the equivalent level (6s) in Rb, given the com-
plications of working with Fr. These measurements are
performed both in a vapor cell and in a MOT . There can
be collisional quenching or radiation trapping in a gas of
atoms that can modify the lifetime; however, we ﬁnd no
evidence of change when we vary the number of atoms
from 103 to 105 in the Rb trap and we establish a limit
on radiation trapping from the Rb data of ±0.01 %. We
have performed an extensive search for some additional
magnetic sensitivity: there is no change in the lifetime
beyond the statistical uncertainty when we change the
gradient of the Fr MOT. The detection of the cascaded
photon reduces the possibility of quantum beats [11]. We
establish a limit on magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects of ±0.11 % in
the uncertainty of the Fr measurement consistent with
our work in Rb [15].

time measurement. The statistical error dominates the
uncertainty of the measurement. We obtain a lifetime of
53.30 ± 0.44 ns for the 8s level of francium.

Figure 4 compares the obtained 8s level lifetime with
theoretical calculations. a to d are ab initio MBPT cal-
culations of the dipole matrix elements by a : Safronova
et al. [9], b : V. A. Dzuba et al. [8], c : W. R. Johnson
et al. [16], and d : V. A. Dzuba et al. [10]. We calculate
the lifetime with Eq. 1 from their predictions and mea-
sured transition energies [17]. e to h are semiempirical
calculations: e : M. Marinescu et al. [18], f : C. E. Theo-
dosiou [19], g : E. Bi´emont et al. [20], and h : W. A. van
Wijngaarden et al. [21]. The scatter of results from the
MBPT calculations is small and they are all within one
percent of our result. The semiempirical methods are
less accurate and they have a broader scatter for their
predictions (expanded scale in Fig. 4).

Our measurement establishes that the MBPT calcu-

lations of matrix elements that contribute to the total
lifetime of the state are very good. They take into ac-
count the large relativistic eﬀects present in this heavy
atom as well as the multiple correlations from its 87 elec-
trons. Their accuracy is vital for future interpretation of
PNC measurements. The agreement of theoretical pre-
dictions over diﬀerent species reinforces the interpreta-
tion of PNC measurements in Cs which are now sensitive
to the nuclear weak force [4].

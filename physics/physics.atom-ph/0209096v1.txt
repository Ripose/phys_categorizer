Abstract

We study the eﬀects of the relativistic electronic dressing in laser-assisted electron-hydrogen
atom elastic collisions. We begin by considering the case when no radiation is present. This
is necessary in order to check the consistency of our calculations and we then carry out the
calculations using the relativistic Dirac-Volkov states. It turns out that a simple formal analogy
links the analytical expressions of the diﬀerential cross section without laser and the diﬀerential
cross section in presence of a laser ﬁeld

1 Introduction

Recently, the study of relativistic aspects of laser-induced processes has proved necessary par-

ticularly as a result of very paramount breakthroughs in laser technology which is capable now to

attain considerable ultrahigh intensities which could never have been dreamt of three or four decades

ago. Many experiments that have shown a relativistic signature have been recently reported. To

name some, the transition between Thomson and Compton scattering inside a very strong laser ﬁeld

was investigated by C.I. Moore, J.P. Knauer and D.D. Meyerhofer [1]. C. Bula et al. [2] performed

experiments on non linear Compton scattering at SLAC. Also, there are many other types of laser-

assisted processes in which relativistic eﬀects may be important. For instance, the process of emission

of very energetic electrons and ions from atomic clusters which are submitted to ultrastrong infrared

laser pulses [3]. It is now obvious that the whole apparatus and formalism of the non relativistic

quantum collision theory [4] has to be revisited in order to extend known non relativistic results to

the relativistic domain. Many theoretical studies of laser-assisted electron-atom collision have been

mainly carried out in the non relativistic regime. [5].

In presenting this work, we want to show that the modiﬁcations of the relativistic diﬀerential cross
e− + H(Is1/2) due to the dressing of

section corresponding to the elastic collision e− + H(Is1/2)

the Dirac-Volkov electron, in the presence of an ultraintense laser ﬁeld can provide many interesting

insights concerning the importance and the signatures of the relativistic eﬀects.

In this work, we do not consider very high laser intensities that allow pair creation [6]and focus

instead on the domain of intensities that justiﬁes a strong classical electromagnetic potential [7].

The Dirac-Volkov electrons are thus dressed by a strong classical electromagnetic ﬁeld with circular

polarization.

The organization of this paper is as follows :

In section (2) we will present the formalism and establish the expression of the relativistic dif-

ferential scattering cross section in absence of the laser ﬁeld. This will serve as a guide and test the

consistency of the calculation in presence of the laser ﬁeld. In section (3), we give the expression of

the diﬀerential cross section in presence of a laser ﬁeld with circular polarization and we compare

it with the relativistic diﬀerential cross section without laser ﬁeld. We show that a simple formal

analogy links these two diﬀerential cross sections.

In section (4), we give a brief discussion of the results. In section (5), we give a brief conclusion.

Throughout this work, we use atomic units and the abbreviation DCS stands for diﬀerential cross

section.

2 Diﬀerential cross section without laser ﬁeld

In order to recover the relativistic diﬀerential cross section without the laser ﬁeld, we begin by
e− + H(Is1/2) in the absence of radiation. The (direct)
considering the process e− + H(Is1/2)
transition amplitude corresponding to this process is :

where the index i for the initial state and the index f stands for the ﬁnal state. As we study the

elastic excitation by electronic impact, we have f = i = (1s1/2). The velocity of light is c = 137.036

the Fourier transform of the average (static) potential felt by the incident electron in the ﬁeld of the

We must of course recover the result in the non relativistic limit (β

0 and γ

relativistic limit.

3 The diﬀerential cross section in presence of a laser ﬁeld

We turn to the calculation of the DCS for elastic scattering without exchange in the ﬁrst Born

approximation and in the presence of a laser ﬁeld. The (direct) transition amplitude in this case is

The four-vector qµ = (Q/c, q) is the four-momentum of the electron inside the laser ﬁeld with wave
four-vector kµ.

The factor R(q) acting on the bispinor u contains information about the spin-dressing ﬁeld interaction.

Thus, the Dirac-Volkov wave function represents a free-electron wave (containing a ﬁeld-dependent

phase) modulated by a wave generated by the interaction of the spin with the classical single mode
ﬁeld with four-vector potential Aµ.

behaved for the forward scattering witch corresponds to s = 0. When no radiation ﬁeld is present,

p

all Bessel functions vanish except for s = 0: We have Js(z = 0) = δs0 and in this case, the result

reduces to the unpolarized DCS given in Eq. (11)

4 Results and discussions

The kinematics of the process is that given in [9] and we maintain the same choice for the laser

angular frequency, that is w = 0.043 which corresponds to a near-infrared neodymium laser.

4.1 The Nonrelativistic regime

In the limit of low electron kinetic energy and moderate ﬁeld strength, typically an electron kinetic

energy W = 100 a.u and a ﬁeld strength ε = 0.05 u.a, it is easy to see that the eﬀects of the
additional spin terms and the dependence of qµ on the spatial orientation of the electron momentum

due to (k.p) are expected to be small. For W = 100 a.u and ε = 0.05 u.a, some angles θ(qi, qf ) and
θ(pi, pf ) are given in Table.1 and this shows indeed that the dependence of qµ (and hence of q) on
the spatial orientation of the electron momentum is indeed small in the nonrelativistic regime.

In Fig. (1), we compare the non relativistic DCS given by Eq. (15) and the relativistic DCS

given by Eq. (11) as functions of the scattering angle θ(pi, pf ) in absence of the laser ﬁeld. As

expected, in the nonrelativistic limit, there is only a small diﬀerence between these two cross sections

and we see that this diﬀerence becomes more pronounced for the case of forward scattering. For

large angle scattering, there is almost no diﬀerence between the nonrelativistic calculations and the

relativistic calculations.

In Fig. (2), instead of plotting

the scattering angle, we use the angular coordinates (θi, φi) of pi and (θf , φf ) of pf to plot the
angular dependence of the two DCSs as functions of θf , the angle between pf and the Oz axis.

geometry where θi = φi = 45◦ and the angle θf varies from 0◦ to 180◦ with φf = 90◦. The relativistic
β2 is equal to 1.0053 which corresponds to an electron kinetic energy equal
parameter γrel = 1/

p

non relativistic DCS is very close to the relativistic one, which was to be expected. Also, there a
peak in the vicinity of θf = 35◦.

In Fig. (3), we compare the relativistic summed DCS with and without laser ﬁeld for the net

exchange of

100 photons. As one can see, the laser ﬁeld gives rise to important modiﬁcations of

values of the angular parameters, one cannot distinguish the two curves in the case of an exchange
300 photons above 70◦ .Beyond this value, the non relativistic DCS is lower than the relativistic

of

±

±

one. In Fig. (8), the DCSs for the absorption of one photon are shown and there is a qualitative

diﬀerence between the two approaches. Indeed, we have already mentioned that there is a peak in the
vicinity of θf = 35◦ when we have plotted the two DCS as functions of θf . This peak is peculiar to the
geometry chosen and the relativistic DCS corresponding to the absorption of one photon is peaked for
35◦ whereas the non relativistic one is peaked at about θf = 30◦. One explanation that can be
θf ≃
given to this diﬀerence is that spin-eﬀects as well as relativistic electronic dressing that are fully taken

into account in the relativistic treatment inﬂuence the location of such peaks. This is another reason

that gives a strong motivation to study relativistic eﬀects in laser-assisted electron-atom collisions.

Experimentalists need to have theoretical predictions that will enable them to focus on a particular

direction. Of course, this is only a modiﬁcation. due to the relativistic electronic dressing. To be

complete, we shall present very soon, a treatment that takes into account the relativistic dressing

of the atomic system by the strong radiation ﬁeld. In Fig. (9), and for the same values of angular

parameters, the DCSs for the emission of one photon are given and as expected there is a complete

analogy between the process of absorption and emission. In fact, these two processes give the same

values for the DCSs.

4.2 The relativistic regime

In the limit of high electron kinetic energy and strong ﬁeld strength, typically an electron kinetic
energy W = c2 a.u and a ﬁeld strength ε = 1.00 a.u, the eﬀects of the additional spin terms and

9

the dependence of qµ on the spatial orientation of the electron momentum due to (k.p) begin top

be noticeable. For these values of W and ε, some cos of angle θ(qi, qf ) and θ(pi, pf ) are given in
Table.2 and this shows indeed that the dependence of qµ (and hence of q) on the spatial orientation

of the electron momentum is not negliegeable in the relativistic regime.

In Fig. (10), the non relativistic DCS is compared to the relativistic DCS as functions of the

dσ
dΩ

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

R ≃

scattering angle θ (not to be confused with the angle θf ). The nonrelativistic formalism is no longer

applicable since there is now a net diﬀerence between the DCS given by Eq. (11) and the DCS given

by Eq. (15) particularly for small angles. Indeed, for the case of forward scattering,

= 1
4 and the diﬀerence between the DCS remains noticeable up to θ = 1.5◦. For large

while

N R

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

dσ
dΩ

angles, both approaches give nearly the same results. In Fig. (11), we compare the non relativistic

DCS and the relativistic DCS without laser ﬁeld as functions of the angle θf . Again, these two DCS
35◦. It is clear that the non relativistic formalism is
present both a peak in the vicinity of θf ≃
no longer applicable as we have considered now a relativistic parameter γrel = 2, with corresponds

to an electron kinetic energy of about 0.511 M ev. It is a fully relativistic regime and we show in

Fig. (12) the DCS with (dashed line ) and without (dotted line ) laser ﬁeld for the net exchange of

3500 photons. Even in this case, the DCS with laser ﬁeld is almost smeared out and one has to

±
go up to a very large number of photon exchange to recover the relativistic DCS without laser ﬁeld.

Unfortunately, and due to a lack of high speed computing facilities, we cannot present for the time

being a complete analysis of the relativistic and the ultrarelativistic regime. However this will be

done in forthcoming paper. Now, we compare the DCSs in the relativistic regime, for the relativistic

parameter γ = 2. In Fig. (13), we compare the summed DCS relativistic and non relativistic where

there is an exchange of

500 photons. The values of the nonrelativistic DCS is almost halved with

±

regard to the relativistic DCS. In Fig (14), we show the angular distribution of the two DCSs for the

process of the absorption of one photon. For the relativistic DCS, there is an appearance of three
peaks one located in the vicinity of θf = 22.5◦ and double peak in the interval (40◦, 45◦) while for the
non relativistic DCS, there is a double peak in the vicinity of 33◦. We also have the same qualitative

result that the non relativistic DCS is almost halved with regard to the relativistic DCS for the

process of absorption of one photon. In Fig. (15), we present the same result but for the process

of emission of one photon. The values of the DCS are exactly the same as that of the absorption

process.

Finally, in Fig. (16), we give the envelope of the diﬀerential cross section as a function of the energy

5 Conclusion

In this work, we have studied the eﬀect of the relativistic electronic dressing in laser-assisted electron-

hydrogen elastic collisions. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that such a calculation has been

carried out at this level. Even if the formalism may seem heavy and complicated, we have (using

the case with no laser ﬁeld as a guide ) checked every step of our calculations. What emerges is

that the relativistic electronic dressing reduces considerably the magnitude of the DCS. We must

sum the DCS given by Eq. (23)over a very large number of photon in order to get the same order of

magnitude as that of the DCS given by Eq. (11). Of course, a more sophisticated approach is needed

in order to have a complete treatment of this relativistic process. The relativistic generalization of

the method due to F.W. Byron and C.J. Joachain [10] which takes into account the atomic dressing

will be presented in a separated paper. These authors and others [11] have show that in the non

relativistic regime, the dressing of atomic states can give rise to very important modiﬁcations of the

DCS. The case of inelastic collisions will be published very soon. The non relativistic treatment of

laser-assisted electron atom collisions taking into account both the electronic dressing and the atomic

dressing has been studied by many authors [12]. All agree that at least in the nonrelativistic regime,

the eﬀects of atomic dressing can modify the behaviour of the DCS. The study of the relativistic

electronic dressing in laser-assisted inelastic collisions will be sent very soon to the Los Alamos web

site xxx.lanl.org. Recently, some authors ([13],[14]) have used the strong ﬁeld approximation (SFA)to

study the photoionization of hydrogen by electron impact. Work is in progress to present a more

rigorous approach.

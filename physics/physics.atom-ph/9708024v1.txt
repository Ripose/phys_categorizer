HYDROGEN ATOMS IN NEUTRON STAR ATMOSPHERES:
ANALYTICAL APPROXIMATIONS FOR BINDING ENERGIES

Alexander Y. Potekhin∗

INTRODUCTION

Since the ﬁrst observations of neutron stars thirty years ago, they have aﬀected
many branches of physics. These extremely compact stars serve as natural physical
laboratories for probing the properties of matter under extreme physical conditions. In
particular, more than half of them possess magnetic ﬁelds B > 1012 G.

Despite their name, neutron stars consist not only of neutrons. They have a
crust containing ionized iron, heavier elements, and exotic neutron-rich nuclei,1 above
which lie liquid and gaseous outer envelopes, which are thought to be composed of iron
or lighter elements.2 The atmosphere, that aﬀects the spectrum of outgoing thermal
radiation, likely consists of hydrogen, the most abundant element in the Universe, which
might be brought to the star surface by fall-out of circumstellar medium. Neutral atoms
can provide an appreciable contribution to the atmospheric opacity.

Apart from the physics of neutron stars, quantum-mechanical calculations of strong-
ly magnetized hydrogen atoms ﬁnd application also in the physics of white dwarf stars3,4
and in the solid state physics.5 Because of this practical demand, hydrogen in strong
magnetic ﬁelds has been well studied in the past two decades.6 The peculiarity of the
problem for neutron stars is that an atom cannot be considered abstractedly from its
106 K), so

that typical kinetic energies of the atoms are non-negligible in comparison with typical
binding energies. Taking the thermal motion into account is highly non-trivial, because
an atom moving across magnetic ﬁeld is equivalent to an atom placed in orthogonal
electric and magnetic ﬁelds, so that the cylindrical symmetry is broken.

Indeed, neutron star atmospheres are hot (T

At γ

cyclotron frequency, the collective motion eﬀects7,8 become especially pronounced. In
particular, so-called decentered states (with the electron localized mostly in the “mag-
netic well” aside from the Coulomb center) are likely to be populated even at the rela-
tively high densities ρ > 10−2 g cm−3 typical of neutron star atmospheres. These exotic
states have been predicted two decades ago by Burkova et al.9 and studied recently by
other authors.10–12

Collective-motion eﬀects on the usual “centered” states have been ﬁrst consid-
ered in frames of the theory of perturbation.8,13 Non-perturbative results covering both
centered and decentered states were subsequently presented for binding energies and
wavefunctions,14,15 oscillator strengths,15 spectral line shapes,16 and photoionization
cross sections.17 None of these data, however, has been published in an easy-to-use
form of tables or analytical expressions.

In this contribution I propose approximate analytical expressions for the binding
energies of the hydrogen atom arbitrarily moving in a magnetic ﬁeld typical of neutron

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

Motion of the hydrogen atom in a magnetic ﬁeld can be conveniently described by
the pseudomomentum K = mp ˙rp+me ˙re−

of the ﬁeld. Gorkov and Dzyaloshinskii19 have shown that in the representation in
which all components of K have deﬁnite values, the relative motion can be described
in terms of a one-particle Hamiltonian which depends on K.

It is convenient to describe the centered states of the atom using the relative
rp as independent variable and the axial gauge of the vector
r. For the decentered states, the “shifted” representation19

At small pseudomomenta K, the states ν = 0 remain tightly bound and cen-
tered, the mean electron-proton separation ¯x being considerably smaller than rc (for
the hydrogen-like states ν
1, however, ¯x is close to rc at any K). The larger K,
the greater is the distortion of the wavefunction towards rc, caused by the motion-
induced electric ﬁeld in the co-moving reference frame, until near some Kc transition
to the decentered state occurs, and the character of the motion totally changes. With
further increasing K, the transverse velocity decreases and tends to zero, whereas the
electron-proton separation increases and tends to rc. Thus, for the decentered states,
the pseudomomentum characterizes electron-proton separation rather than velocity.

At very large K the longitudinal functions become oscillator-like, corresponding
to a wide, shallow parabolic potential well.9 For a ﬁxed ν, this limit is reached at
2)2¯h/aB, where aB is the Bohr radius. Still at arbitrarily large K, there remain
K
inﬁnite number of bound states with high values of ν whose longitudinal wavefunctions
are governed by the Coulomb tail of the eﬀective one-dimensional potential.15

The decentered states of the atom at K > Kc ∼

to be destroyed by collisions with surrounding particles in the laboratory and in the

white-dwarf atmospheres. In neutron-star atmospheres at γ
centered states may be signiﬁcantly populated. This necessitates inclusion of the entire
range of K below and above Kc in the consideration.

ANALYTICAL APPROXIMATIONS

Binding Energies of the Non-Moving Hydrogen Atom

Binding Energies of the Moving Hydrogen Atom

For the moving hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic ﬁeld, the ﬁrst analytical ﬁt
to E(K) has been published by Lai and Salpeter.26 It is rather accurate for the ground
state at K < Kc but cannot be applied to excited or decentered states.

We describe the longitudinal energy (3) by the formula

The two-term structure of (6) is dictated by the necessity to describe the two physically
distinct regions of K below and above Kc. The parameter α has the meaning of the
width of the transition region near Kc in logarithmic scale of pseudomomenta.

For the tightly-bound states, we parameterize the dependencies E(j)(K) as follows:

In ﬁgure 1 the above ﬁtting formulae are compared with our numerical results15

only in narrow ranges of K near anticrossings.

Now let us turn to the hydrogen-like states. Their binding energies are approxi-
mated by the same formula (6) but with slightly diﬀerent expressions for E(1) and E(2).
For these states, M ⊥
nsν exceeds mH by orders of magnitude, and the perturbation method
fails already at small K,13 rendering the notion of the eﬀective mass practically useless

CONCLUDING REMARKS

The analytical approximations for binding energies presented in this contribution
depend continuously on two arguments — magnetic ﬁeld strength and transverse pseu-
domomentum. They are accurate, typically, within a few parts in 100–1000. The
accuracy can be improved by almost an order of magnitude by optimizing the param-
eters meﬀ, Kc, α, q1, q2 in equations (6)–(8) separately at each discrete value of γ.
Tables of such optimized parameters have been obtained and will be published else-
where, together with analytical approximations of geometrical sizes of various quantum-
mechanical states of the moving atom and oscillator strengths of radiative transitions
among them. The atomic sizes play important role in distribution of atoms over quan-
tum states in a plasma and in their contribution to the plasma absorption coeﬃcients.
For example, a size of an atom may be used to evaluate eﬀects of “unbounding” of
electrons caused by random charge distribution in the plasma. For non-magnetized
hydrogen plasma, an approximate treatment of these eﬀects was revised recently;27 for

5

the strong magnetic ﬁelds analogous work is under way. Eventually, the analytical
estimates of K-dependencies of the binding energies, atomic sizes, and transition rates
help to generalize previously developed models of fully ionized atmospheres of magnetic
neutron stars28 to the more realistic case of partially ionized atmospheres.

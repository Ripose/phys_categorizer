Introduction.
to go beyond the Coulomb approximation for the two-electron interaction. The usual
next step is to include the Breit interaction. A number of commonly used atomic
packages, such as GRASP package [1], allows to do this routinely. However, in many
precision calculations one needs to account for diﬀerent corrections, which are not
included in standard packages. Thus, it may be important to analyze the role of the
Breit interaction on diﬀerent stages of atomic calculations. Below we present several
simple observations which may help to include Breit interaction in atomic calculations
in an optimal way.

Breit interaction between electrons 1 and 2 has the form

where ~αi are Dirac matrices and r12 is the distance between the electrons. Equation
(1) can be readily derived from the general expression for the interaction via transverse
photon in the Coulomb gauge by expanding it in powers of the photon frequency (see, for
example, [2]). The operator V 1
B is called the magnetic (or Gaunt) term and the operator
V 2
B is called the retardation term [3]. The magnetic term of the Breit operator is known
to dominate in atomic calculations [4] and it is much simpler than the whole Breit
operator. In present work we will neglect the retardation term and we will check the
accuracy of this approximation by comparison to the resent calculation by Derevianko
[5] where the whole Breit operator was used. Note also, that some technical details
of atomic calculations with retardation term were recently discussed in [6] (see also
references therein).

Breit interactions in Dirac-Fock calculations. Here, we are interested in the calculations
of the low-energy properties of heavy atoms. In such calculations all electrons are usually
divided into two parts: the core electrons and the valence ones. Correspondingly, the
interaction between electrons is reduced to the interaction between the valence electrons
and the interaction of the valence electrons with atomic core. The latter is described by
the Hartree-Fock potential which includes direct and exchange terms. In this case the
following observations can be made.

(i) Breit correction to the interaction between the valence electrons is of the order of
α2 (α is the ﬁne structure constant) which is usually below the accuracy of modern
calculations of heavy atoms.

(ii) Breit correction to the direct term of the Hartree-Fock potential turns to zero if the
core includes only closed shells. Indeed, the vertex of the Breit interaction includes
Dirac matrix ~α, which is averaged to zero when summation over the closed shell is
done.

(iii) Breit correction to the exchange interaction of the valence electron with the core
does not turn to zero and is of the order of R2, where R is the overlap integral
between the upper component of a valence orbital and the lower component of a
core one. The largest integrals R correspond to the innermost core orbitals, where
small components are of the order of αZ. Thus, the dominant Breit correction is
the one to the exchange core potential.

(iv) The exchange interaction between valence electrons and the innermost core
electrons is signiﬁcantly screened if the core relaxation is allowed. Therefore, it
is very important that Breit correction to the core potential is calculated self-
consistently. In some cases the core relaxation can reduce the ﬁnal Breit correction
to the valence energies by an order of magnitude (see the results for Cs below).

We are not going to give all technical details of the calculations here, but there
are few points to be mentioned, at least brieﬂy. Above we have argued that the only
important contribution of the Breit interaction comes from the exchange with the core.
The corresponding matrix element can be written in a form:

There are two things one has to keep in mind when solving the Dirac-Fock-Coulomb-
Breit (DFCB) equations. The ﬁrst is that Breit approximation is not completely
relativistic and, thus, some caution may be necessary. For example, one can use
projectors to the positive energy states. Technically that can be done with the help
of the kinetic balance condition for the small components of the Dirac orbitals. Second,
if we include Breit interaction in DF equations, the resultant corrections are not linear
in Breit interaction. It is not diﬃcult to eliminate the higher orders in Breit interaction
with the help of a scaling parameter λ: one can substitute VB with λVB and then
calculate limλ→0(δελ
n/λ). In practice, however, the higher orders in
Breit interaction are usually small enough to be neglected even for λ = 1 and there is
no need in calculating these limits.

n/λ) and limλ→0(δϕλ

Correlation eﬀects. The usual accuracy of the DF approximation for binding energies
of heavy atoms is of the order of 10%, while the Breit corrections are usually about
1% or less. Therefore, there is no point in calculating Breit corrections if one is not
going to account for correlations in some way. It is usually convenient to distinguish
between valence-valence and valence-core, or core-core correlations. The easiest and
straightforward way to treat the former is to use the conﬁguration interaction (CI)
method, while the latter are treated more eﬃciently within the many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT) in residual Coulomb interaction [7]. Below we discuss how to include
Breit interaction in the CI and the MBPT calculations.

If the CI is done in the frozen core approximation, then as we have said above,
there is no need to include Breit corrections to the two-electron interaction, but it is
necessary to include Breit corrections to the core potential. It is also important that
core orbitals are found from the DFCB equations.

If the MBPT in residual Coulomb interaction is used to account for valence-core
and core-core correlations, one may need to include Breit corrections to corresponding
diagrams. Generally speaking, there are two types of corrections: “direct” and “indirect”
ones. The former corresponds to the substitution of the residual Coulomb interaction
with the Breit interaction in the MBPT expressions, and the latter corresponds to the
use of the DFCB equations as a zero order approximation. The direct corrections are
suppressed because the largest Breit radial integrals correspond to the virtual excitations
from the innermost core shells (see above) and these excitations correspond to the
huge energy denominators. Therefore, one can neglect them without signiﬁcant loss of
accuracy. The indirect corrections are much simpler: they are accounted for simply by
the use of the DFCB basis set instead of the DFC one.

We see that dominant Breit corrections come from the solution of the DFCB
equations for atomic orbitals. After that these orbitals can be used as a basis set for the
CI and the MBPT calculations. On the CI stage one has to include Breit potential of
the core explicitly when calculating one-electron integrals for valence electrons, while in
the MBPT calculations the direct Breit corrections can be neglected altogether. That
signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes calculations and allows to use standard CI and MBPT codes

without signiﬁcant changes.

Up to now we have focused on the calculations of atomic spectra. If it is necessary
to calculate some other atomic observables, the general calculation scheme remains
the same [8]. However, the MBPT part should be extended and some new types of
the MBPT corrections may appear. Also, it may be necessary to solve the random-
phase approximation (RPA) equations for the operator of interest. For example, if we
calculate hyperﬁne structure (HFS) constants, we have to solve the RPA equations for
the operator of the hyperﬁne interaction. Again there are direct and indirect Breit
corrections to these equations. The latter are easily included in the same way as above.
The former are important only for operators which are singular at the origin and, thus,
have large matrix elements for the innermost core electrons. This is the case for the
hyperﬁne interaction, while electric dipole operator gives the opposite example.

Numerical results. Here we present some results for Cs and Tl. These two atoms are
interesting because they are used in precision measurements of parity nonconservation
and high accuracy atomic calculations are necessary to compare these measurements
with Standard model predictions. The nuclear charge Z for Tl is much larger than for
Cs, so we can also see how Breit corrections grow with the nuclear charge.

In table 1 we present results of the DF calculations of binding energies for Cs in the
Coulomb and Coulomb-Breit approximations. We also give results of the perturbative
calculations of the Breit corrections for comparison. It is seen that the relaxation of the
core signiﬁcantly reduces Breit corrections to the valence energies.

In table 2 the direct Breit corrections to the HFS constants are given. As we
have mentioned above, here one has to calculate Breit correction to the RPA vertices
in addition to the corrections to the orbitals. In notations of Derevianko [5] the latter
corresponds to the one-particle correction and the former corresponds to the two-particle
one. It is seen again that corrections obtained in the self-consistent approach are much
smaller than the corresponding ﬁrst order perturbative corrections. That is caused by
the screening of the Breit interaction by the core electrons which is neglected in the
perturbative approach. Note, that screening eﬀect is particularly important for the
s-wave.

The diﬀerence between our calculations of the ﬁrst order Breit corrections to the
HFS constants and the results of the paper [5] should be due to the retardation term
in (1). This diﬀerence is about 10% for the p-wave and 25% for the s-wave. That
conﬁrms that this term is signiﬁcantly smaller than the magnetic one, but it can become
important when Breit correction becomes larger or the accuracy of the calculations is
improved.

On the next stage we calculated correlation corrections following the method
described in [7, 8]. These corrections include the self-energy correction to the Hartree-
Fock potential and the structural radiation corrections to the HFS operator. The latter
contribution is small and we did not calculate Breit corrections to it. Note that the
indirect Breit corrections were calculated for the self-energy and the RPA contributions,

Letter to the Editor

while the direct Breit corrections for the self-energy were neglected. The results of these
calculations are given in table 3. It is seen that direct and indirect Breit corrections to
the HFS constants are comparable. That means that it is important to include Breit
corrections when electronic correlations are considered.

Calculations for Tl are much more complicated and require large CI for three valence
electrons in addition to the MBPT (see [7, 8] for details). The Breit corrections appear
to be much more important for Tl than for Cs. Here they are not negligible already
when the energy spectrum is considered (see table 4). In particular, the ﬁne structure
splitting of the ground state is changed by 1%. Another diﬀerence from Cs is that the
screening eﬀect here is relatively weaker, but still signiﬁcant. For example, the ﬁrst
order Breit correction to the ﬁne splitting of the ground state is −130 cm−1 while the
DFCB value is −81 cm−1.

Comparison of the results of the CI calculations from table 4 with the ﬁnal results,
which include the MBPT corrections, demonstrates that Breit contributions to the
MBPT part constitute about 10% of the total Breit corrections to the transition
frequencies. That is consistent with the overall role of the MBPT corrections in the
ﬁnal answer where they also contribute about 10%.

Conclusions. We see that Breit interaction is important in precision calculations of
heavy atoms. It is suﬃcient to include only (exchange) Breit potential of the core and
neglect valence-valence Breit interaction.
It is important to allow core relaxation to
avoid overestimation of Breit corrections to energies and orbitals of valence electrons.
It is also important to calculate Breit corrections to the RPA part and to the MBPT
part when one calculates the HFS constants or other similar observables.

Three dimensional electrodynamic trapping of neutral atoms has been demonstrated. By applying
time-varying inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds with micron-sized electrodes, nearly 102 strontium atoms
in the 1S0 state have been trapped with a lifetime of 80 ms. In order to design the electrodes, we
numerically analyzed the electric ﬁeld and simulated atomic trajectories in the trap, which showed
reasonable agreement with the experiment.

Coherent manipulation of atoms or ions in the vicin-
ity of solid surfaces has attracted increasing interest as
a promising tool for quantum information processing
(QIP), because of their potential scalability and control-
lability of atoms or ions that work as qubits [1, 2, 3, 4].
So far, two approaches, i.e., magnetic manipulation of
atoms with miniaturized wire traps [5, 6] and miniature
Paul traps [1] for ions, have been demonstrated. Re-
cent experiments, however, have witnessed that coher-
ence time of these trapped atoms or ions was shortened
by electro-magnetic interactions caused by thermal mag-
netic ﬁelds [7, 8, 9, 10] or ﬂuctuating patch potentials
[12] appeared on the surface if the distance between the
particle and the surface become smaller than 100 µm. To
avoid these harmful inﬂuences and have a lifetime nearly
a second, paramagnetic atoms need to be more than tens
of microns apart from metal surfaces at room temper-
ature [7, 8, 9, 10]. A reported heating rate of ions [12]
indicated stronger coupling of trapped ions to surface po-
tentials than that of neutral atoms.

It has been pointed out that the best candidates for
long-lived trap are spinless neutral atoms, which weakly
interact with stray ﬁelds via the Stark eﬀect [13, 14].
Alternatively, material dependence of the trap lifetime
has been investigated to reduce thermal magnetic ﬁeld in
magnetic atom-chips [9, 10, 11]. Electric manipulation of
atoms, which allows manipulating spinless neutral atoms
in addition to paramagnetic atoms and molecules, may
open up a new possibility for scalable quantum systems
with long coherence time.
In this Letter, we demon-
strate three dimensional (3D) electrodynamic trapping
of laser cooled Sr atoms in the 1S0 state with miniature
electrodes fabricated on a glass plate. The very thin elec-
trodes (
40 nm) used in the experiment will signiﬁcantly
reduce thermal magnetic ﬁelds near metal surfaces, which
would be especially proﬁtable in applying this scheme to
paramagnetic atoms.

larizability α is positive for atoms in stable states, these
atoms can be trapped at a local maximum of the electric
ﬁeld strength and behave as a “high-ﬁeld seeker”. How-
ever, as the Laplace equation does not allow an electro-

−

static ﬁeld to form a maximum in free space, 3D trapping
is not possible for a static electric ﬁeld alone [15]. In ad-
dition owing to a small dipole polarizability, rather high
electric ﬁelds are required for the Stark manipulation of
laser-cooled atoms: So far 1D or 2D focusing/trapping
experiments [16, 17, 18] have been demonstrated by ap-
plying several to ten kV to electrodes with dimensions of
a few mm. A dynamic stabilization scheme, as employed
in RF ion traps, allows electric trapping with higher di-
mensions. Electrodynamic 2D focusing of atoms [16] and
guiding of molecules [19] were demonstrated by using 4
rods with oscillating voltages. 3D trapping by 3 phase
electric dipole ﬁelds [20] or by an oscillating hexapole
ﬁeld superimposed on a static homogeneous ﬁeld [21]
has been proposed. The latter scheme has recently been
demonstrated in trapping cold polar molecules [22].

Here we consider 3D electrodynamic trapping with
two-phase electric-dipole ﬁeld, which will allow planar
geometry that is suitable to be used with atom chips
[23]. In order to illustrate the scheme, we ﬁrst assume

where m is the atomic mass, ω0 = (2bV0/d3)
3α/m is
the trapping frequency of an atom perpendicular to the
dipole axis. The axial symmetry of electrodes determines
η = 2 and ξ = 1. The static dipole polarizability of

ground state is used in the calculation. While both of the
potentials ux and uy provide static conﬁnement along the
z axis, they form saddle potential in the xy-plane. The
3D trapping, therefore, can be realized by dynamically
stabilizing atomic trajectories in xy-plane by alternating
these two potentials. In Eq. (1) anharmonic terms higher
than r2
j /d4, where ri and rj stand for x, y, z coordinate,
are neglected. However, as discussed later, these terms
play crucial role in determining the eﬀective trap volume.
By switching the charge distribution between x and y
axis at a period of T /2, the time-dependent Stark poten-
tial is given by

where n is an integer. The time evolution of the position
and velocity of an atom subjected to U (r, t) can be de-
scribed by transfer matrices [18, 26], whose eigen-values
of
1 guarantee stable trapping. Harmonic approxi-
mation of the Stark potential as given in Eq. (1) is used
to determine the stability of the trap with respect to the
driving frequency f0
1/T . For the electrodes conﬁgu-
ration with η = 2 (and ξ = 1) as discussed above, the sta-
bility regime is calculated to be 1.56 < 2πf0/ω0 < 1.80
[23] (see Fig. 2(a)). This narrow stability regime for f0,
however, made experiments rather challenging.

≡

The stability regime on f0 can be extended by reduc-
ing the normalized strength η of the anti-trapping poten-
tial, as shown by a gray area in Fig. 2(a). Wider driv-
ing frequency range can be obtained for η close to unity,
which is realized by applying line charges instead of point
charges. Figure 1(b) depicts a model for designing actual
electrodes, where shaded parts are made of conducting
material and the other parts insulator. When voltages
are applied to four rectangular parallelepiped electrodes
with diagonal separation of √2w and thickness of h, most
of the charges distribute at the ridge of the electrodes.
Therefore the Stark potential can be approximated by
line charges of length h.

We numerically analyzed the electric ﬁeld produced by
these electrodes by employing the ﬁnite element method
(FEM). Figure 2(b) shows the normalized strength of the
anti-trapping potential η (ﬁlled circles) and that of the
static potential ξ (empty circles) as a function of the
electrode thickness h, where channel width of w = 50 µm

were obtained in agreement with the case of two point
charges [23] because the charge distributes at the tip of
the electrode. By increasing the thickness of the elec-
trodes, while the trapping frequency √ξω0 along z-axis
becomes weaker, η approaches to unity and wider sta-
bility region can be obtained, as expected for the two
dimensional atom guide [16, 19].

Considering these trade-oﬀs, we designed the thickness
of the electrodes as h=100 µm for w = 50 µm, which
provided η = 1.1 (see Fig. 2(b)). By applying voltages
of V0 = 200 V to the electrodes, ω0 = 2π
2.9 kHz and
√ξω0 = 2π
0.89 kHz along z-axis were obtained. The
latter is strong enough to support atoms against gravity
even when z-axis directs vertically. The electrode assem-
bly was made on a 100-µm-thick fused-silica substrate of
1 inch diameter, which was ﬁrst coated with 250 nm thick
silver on both sides. A cross through-hole and electrode
pattern were fabricated by Focused Ion Beam (FIB) pro-
cess. Side-walls of the hole were then coated with 40-nm-
thick silver to form four electrodes. Figure 3(a) shows a
scanning ion microscope (SIM) image of the atom chip.
An electrodynamic trapping experiment was per-
formed in four steps, in less than a second: (1) Laser cool-
ing and trapping of 88Sr atoms, (2) transport of atoms
into an electric trap, (3) electrodynamic trapping, and
(4) detection of trapped atoms. A schematic of an ex-
perimental setup is shown in Fig. 3(b). We cooled and
trapped more than 104 atoms at several µK in 0.6 s by
3P1 spin-
using magneto-optical trap (MOT) on the 1S0

of the electrodes as shown in Fig. 3(a) were used as a mir-
ror to perform a mirror MOT [6], in which the trapped
atom cloud was located 1.5 mm below the mirror surface.
This electrode assembly, or the “Stark chip” was glued on
a 1-mm-thick vacuum view port with a clear aperture of
10−9 Torr
8 mm. The vacuum pressure was typically 1
during the experiment.

The atoms were then loaded into a one dimensional
far-oﬀ-resonant optical lattice (FORL) formed by a pair
of counter-propagating lasers at λL
810 nm [28]. These
lasers were focused onto the center of the through hole of
the Stark chip. The 1/e2 waist radius was set to 16 µm
so as to have the Rayleigh length of 1 mm to reach atoms
in the MOT. Laser intensity of 100 mW per beam was
chosen to provide a lattice potential with a radial conﬁne-
1.2 kHz at the chip center,
ment frequency of ωr
×
which was close to a secular frequency of the electric trap
as described below and allowed a good mode matching
in atom loading into the electric trap. By changing the
frequency of one of the lattice lasers [29], we adiabati-
cally transported atoms into the atom chip in 6.8 ms.
The transported atomic cloud inside the electrode gap
had a temperature of about 7 µK and a 1/e2 radius of
ratom

7 µm.

Turning oﬀ the lattice lasers, the electrodynamic trap-
ping was started by applying V0 = 200 V onto the di-
agonal electrodes (see Fig. 1(b)) at a driving frequency
6.4 kHz, which gave a secular frequency of
of f0
1.0 kHz. After a certain trapping time, the elec-
≈
tric trap was switched oﬀ. Using the moving lattice,
we extracted the atoms 0.28 mm below the chip to ob-
serve trapped atoms. We illuminated them with a 10-
µs-long probe laser resonant to the 1S0
1P1 transition
at λ = 461 nm. The ﬂuorescence was imaged onto an
Intensiﬁed CCD (ICCD) camera to measure the number
of trapped atoms with an uncertainty of 10 %.

atoms as a function of the driving frequency f0 for a
trapping time of 5 ms. We have performed numerical
integrations of the equation of motion of an atom sub-
jected to the alternating electric ﬁelds [23] that were cal-
culated by the FEM for the electrode conﬁguration shown
in Fig. 1(b). Taking the initial atom temperature and its
spatial distribution as used in the experiment, the calcu-
lation (solid line) well reproduced the experiment, where
the amplitude (atom number) was used as a ﬁtting pa-
rameter.

As mentioned earlier the stability of the miniaturized
electric trap is crucially aﬀected by the anharmonicity
of the trapping potential, since the Stark potential pro-
vided by the dipole electric ﬁeld contains relatively-large
higher-order terms [24]. These terms limit the eﬀective
trap diameter 2reﬀ to be typically one ﬁfth of the elec-
trode separation √2w as determined by numerical simu-
lation [23]. This limited trapping volume, in turn, makes
the capture velocity vc of the trap be dependent on a
starting phase φ0 of electric trapping ﬁeld. Atoms with
an outward velocity vc toward a particular direction, say
x-axis, need to be decelerated by the driving ﬁeld be-
fore reaching reﬀ by the end of the trapping-phase, while
the similar but 180◦ out of phase discussion applies for
the atomic motion in y-axis that is in the anti-trapping
phase. We deﬁned φ0 = 0 when the Stark potential
U (r, t) was switched at t = nT as given in Eq. (2), i.e.,
φ0 = t−nT
360◦ for the n-th driving period, and studied

the starting phase φ0 dependent trap eﬃciency as shown
in Fig. 4(b). The number of trapped atoms (ﬁlled cir-
cles) was in reasonable agreement with a numerical sim-
ulation (solid line), where the amplitude (atom number)
was used as an adjustable parameter, indicating that the
best loading is realized for the trapping ﬁeld started at
φ0 = 90◦ or 270◦. In the experiment, a slight asymmetry
in the peak heights was observed. This may be attributed
to spatial oﬀset of an initial atomic cloud with respect to
the trap center, which was possibly caused by misalign-
ment of the FORL lasers. We have measured the lifetime
of atoms in the electric trap to be 80 ms, which was
in reasonable agreement with glancing-collisions-limited
lifetime [32] assuming the background gas pressure of
10−8 Torr in the electrode gap. Note that similar
∼
lifetime was observed for atoms in the FORL, when its
trap depth was comparable to that of the electric trap
(
≈

30µK).
In applying atom-traps to QIP experiments, qubit
states should experience the same trapping potential so
as to minimize decoherence caused by atomic motion
[30, 31]. For example, in the case of this Stark trap,
m
Zeeman substates of the 3P2 metastable state, which has
a lifetime over 100 s [33], can be used as a qubit state that

±

experience the same Stark shift. Although the coherent
evolution of these states may be disturbed by the thermal
magnetic ﬁelds that appeared on the electrodes surfaces,
a very thin electrode (40 nm) demonstrated here may
signiﬁcantly reduce thermal magnetic ﬁelds that cause
spin ﬂips [13, 14], since the Johnson noise induced cur-
rents decrease as electrode’s thickness [10]. Furthermore,
since the operation of the electrodynamic trap relies on
switching of electric ﬁelds, it is free from ohmic dissi-
pation and allows dense integration of traps. Array of
electrodes, four of which activated in turn so as to adia-
batically transfer atoms, may constitute atom wave guide
that is reminiscent of the quantum CCD [34].

In conclusion, we have investigated the design of elec-
trodes with a help of numerical simulation and demon-
strated an electrodynamic trapping of spinless neutral
Sr atoms with micron-sized structures. By reducing the
electrode size to a few µm, these atom traps can be driven
by a few volts [23], which will make electric atom traps
compatible with electronic logic circuits, oﬀering an in-
terface between atom manipulation and electronics.

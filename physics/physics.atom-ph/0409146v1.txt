Abstract. We perform spectroscopy on the hyperﬁne splitting of 85Rb atoms trapped
in far-oﬀ-resonance optical traps. The existence of a spatially dependent shift in the
energy levels is shown to induce an inherent dephasing eﬀect, which causes a broadening
of the spectroscopic line and hence an inhomogeneous loss of atomic coherence at a
much faster rate than the homogeneous one caused by spontaneous photon scattering.
We present here a number of approaches for reducing this inhomogeneous broadening,
based on trap geometry, additional laser ﬁelds, and novel microwave pulse sequences.
We then show how hyperﬁne spectroscopy can be used to study quantum dynamics of
optically trapped atoms.

1. Introduction

The development of laser cooling and trapping techniques [1, 2, 3] has been motivated,
to a great extent, by their potential use for precision measurements, of which precision
frequency measurements are of outmost importance. Cold atoms are attractive for these
measurements mainly because of the suppression of the Doppler broadening and because
they allow for a longer interrogation time and hence a narrower linewidth.

Modern atomic frequency standards are based on atomic clocks, which measure
the frequency associated with the transition between two ground state hyperﬁne levels.
The performance of such a clock can be improved by lengthening the time over which
such a transition is measured. During the 1950’s various possibilities were suggested to
lengthen this interrogation time: Ramsey [4] proposed conﬁning the atoms in a storage
ring with an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, or a storage cell with properly coated walls.
Zacharias [5] proposed to build an atomic “fountain” in which a thermal beam of atoms
is launched upward, so slow atoms from the tail of the velocity distribution will turn
around and fall back under the force of gravity. Using the Ramsey method of separated
ﬁelds, the atoms could be interrogated once on their way up and then again on their way
down, resulting in a long total interrogation time. Back then, this idea failed because of
collisions of these slow atoms with the faster ones. Using laser-cooled atoms, Zacharias’
idea was revived in 1989 by Kasevich et. al.
[6]. They cooled sodium atoms using
a magneto-optical trap [7] and launched them on ballistic trajectories by applying a
short pulse of resonant light. Two short π
2 microwave pulses were applied as the atoms

turned around inside a waveguide and allowed the ground-state hyperﬁne splitting to
be measured with a linewidth of 2 Hz.

To further increase the measurement time beyond the practical limit imposed by
the height of a fountain, one can use trapped atoms, and in particular optical dipole
traps, based on the dipole potential created by the interaction of a neutral atom and
a laser beam [8, 9]. Unfortunately, the interaction between the trapping light and the
trapped atoms is not negligible. First, even for a far-oﬀ-resonance trap, where many of
the undesired eﬀects of the atom-light interaction are suppressed, residual spontaneous
scattering of photons from the trap laser destroys the ground state spin polarization
or spin coherence [10]. Next, and more importantly, atom trapping relies on inducing
a spatial inhomogeneous shift of the atomic energy levels, and the existence of such
a shift makes precision spectroscopy of trapped atoms a diﬃcult task. In the case of
hyperﬁne spectroscopy in optical traps, the inhomogeneity is approximately equal for
both states, since the trapping light interacts with both levels with the same strength
(the dipole matrix elements are identical). However, the diﬀerence in detuning between
them results in a diﬀerential
inhomogeneity, which induces a dephasing eﬀect and,
when ensemble-averaged, causes a broadening of the spectroscopic line and hence a loss
of atomic coherence at a much faster rate than the spontaneous photon scattering rate
[11]. These eﬀects can be reduced by increasing the trap detuning [11, 12, 13, 14] and
also by using blue-detuned optical traps, in which the atoms are conﬁned mainly in the
dark [11, 15]. However, the residual frequency shifts are still the main factor limiting
the coherence of the trapped atoms, and hence the use of dipole traps for precision
spectroscopy.

A number of approaches for reducing the inhomogeneous broadening of the ground
state hyperﬁne splitting of optically trapped atoms are presented in this tutorial.
Following a brief review on light shifts and optical dipole traps in section 2, and a
description of the basic experimental setup in section 3, we present in section 4 a
simple, classical model for microwave spectroscopy in an optical trap, and use it to
analyze the atomic coherence times for diﬀerent trap geometries in section 5. Based
on this model, we present in section 6 a novel method for reducing the inhomogeneous
frequency broadening by the addition of a weak light ﬁeld, spatially mode-matched with
the trapping ﬁeld and whose frequency is tuned in-between the two hyperﬁne levels. In
section 7 we show another way of achieving long coherence times in an optical trap: a
narrow energy distribution is achieved using a microwave “pre-selection” pulse which
selects a subset of the atomic ensemble. Our technique allows the selection of a narrow
energy band around any central energy enabling us to maximize the number of selected
atoms (for a given energy width) by choosing the energy with the highest density of
populated states.

A full, quantum-mechanical model is developed in section 8. The limit of short
and strong pulses is further elaborated in section 9, and used to predict the Ramsey

10 it is shown that, for certain trap parameters, the dephasing can be reversed by

Hyperﬁne Spectroscopy of Optically Trapped Atoms

stimulating a “coherence echo”. The failure of the echo for other trap parameters is
due to dynamics in the trap, and thereby “echo spectroscopy” can also be used to study
quantum dynamics in the trap even when more than 106 states are thermally populated,
and to study the crossover from quantum dynamics to classical dynamics. We then show
(in section 12) that the decay in the hyperﬁne coherence due to interactions with the
environment, is only partly suppressed by echo spectroscopy, primarily due to dynamical
(time-dependent) dephasing mechanisms. An improved pulse sequence is demonstrated,
containing additional π pulses for which the decay of coherence is reduced by a factor
2.5 beyond the reduction oﬀered by the simple echo scheme.

Finally, in section 13 we show that our echo spectroscopy methods enable us to
study quantum dynamics of trapped atoms also for chaotic and mixed dynamics where,
surprisingly, partial revivals of atomic coherence occur in the perturbative (quantum)
regime, and disappear in the non-perturbative (semi-classical) regime, indicating a clear
quantum to classical transition as a function of the perturbation strength.

2. Light Shifts and Dipole Traps

Throughout the work presented in this tutorial we use far-oﬀ-resonance optical dipole
traps, which are traps based on the dipole potential created by the interaction of a
neutral atom and a laser beam [9]. A few concepts on which the rest of the work
presented here is based, are reviewed. In sections 2.1 and 2.2 a brief review of the origin
of the dipole potential, and its connection with the ac Stark shift of the ground-state is
presented using an idealized two-level atom. In section 2.3 a short review on the use of
the dipole potential to trap neutral atoms is given
. In sections 2.4 and 2.5, a description
§
of the main mechanisms for atomic decoherence is given, this time for multi-level atoms.

2.1. The Optical Dipole Potential

The interaction of a neutral atom and a nearly-resonant electro-magnetic ﬁeld is
governed by the dipole interaction, and is usually separated into two terms which
correspond to a reactive force and a dissipative force. When an atom is exposed to
light, the electric ﬁeld component induces a dipole moment in the atom, oscillating at
the driving-light frequency.

If we assume for example a monochromatic light ﬁeld with an electric ﬁeld given
by ~E(~r, t) = ˆeE(~r)e−
iωLt + c.c., where ˆe is the unit polarization vector and ωL the
frequency, then the dipole moment is ~d(~r, t) = ˆed(~r)e−
iωLt + c.c.. The amplitude of the
dipole moment is related to the amplitude of the ﬁeld by d = αE, where α is the atomic
complex polarizability, which is a function of the driving frequency. The interaction of
the induced dipole moment with the driving ﬁeld gives rise to the potential [9]

In a quantum picture, the dipole force results from absorption of a photon from the
ﬁeld followed by stimulated emission of a photon into a diﬀerent mode of the laser ﬁeld.
The momentum transfer is the vector diﬀerence between the momenta of the absorbed
and emitted photons. The dissipative component has its origin in cycles of absorption
of photons, followed by spontaneous emission, in a random direction. Using equation 2
we can write an equation for the rate of spontaneous photon scattering:

The atomic polarizability can be calculated by using the solutions of the optical

As seen, in the perturbative limit the light-shift of the ground state is equal to the dipole
potential in equation 6. The reason is that, since in this regime the atom is mostly in
the ground state, the light shifted ground state can be identiﬁed as the potential for
the motion of the atoms (see ﬁgure 1c). In the case of multi-level atoms, equation 14
should be modiﬁed to include the electric dipole interaction between the ground-state
and all the excited states, with their respective detuning and transition strength (see
section 2.5).

2.3. Optical Dipole Traps

The dissipative part of the atom-light interaction is used for laser cooling of atoms
[16], a pre-requisite for optical trapping. However, spontaneous photon scattering is in
general detrimental to trapped atoms, mainly because it can induce heating and loss.
Comparing equations 6 and 7 yields,

which results in the well known fact that a trap with an arbitrarily small scattering rate
can be formed by increasing the detuning while maintaining the ratio I/δ.

Equation 6 indicates that if the laser frequency is smaller than the resonance
frequency, i.e. δ < 0 (“red-detuning”) the dipole potential is negative and the atoms are
attracted by the light ﬁeld. The minima of the potential is found then at the position
of maximum intensity. In the case δ > 0 (“blue detuning”) the minima of the potential
is located at the minima of the light intensity.

Trapping atoms with optical dipole potentials was ﬁrst proposed by Letokhov [20]
and Ashkin [21] . Chu and coworkers [8], were the ﬁrst to realize such a trap, trapping
about 500 atoms for several seconds using a tightly focused red-detuned beam. Later,
a far-oﬀ-resonant trap for rubidium atoms was demonstrated [13], with a detuning of
106γ. In this case, the potential is nearly conservative and
up to 65 nm, i.e. δ > 5

spontaneous scattering of photons is greatly reduced. A comprehensive review of the
diﬀerent schemes and applications of such optical dipole traps is presented in reference
[9]. In the limiting case where the frequency of the trapping light is much smaller then
the atomic resonance, trapping is still possible, practically with no photon scattering
[22]. Such a quasi-electrostatic trap, formed by two crossed CO2 laser beams, was used
to create a Bose-Einstein condensate without the use of magnetic traps [23].

Apart from using far-oﬀ-resonance lasers, the interaction between the light ﬁeld and
the atoms can be reduced by the use of blue-detuned traps, in which atoms are conﬁned
mostly in the dark [15]. Experimentally, blue-detuned traps, which require surrounding
a dark region of space with a repulsive dipole potential, are harder to realize than
red-detuned ones, where already a single focused beam constitutes a trap [8]. Several
conﬁgurations for far-detuned dark optical traps were demonstrated, in which gravity
provided the conﬁnement in one direction: “Light sheets” traps were generated by
elliptically focusing two laser beams and overlapping the two propagating light sheets to
form a “V” cross-section that supports against gravity, while the conﬁnement in the laser
propagation direction is provided by the beam divergence [11]. In a later work, and in
order to achieve larger trapping volume, a diﬀerent trap was constructed with four light
sheets producing an inverted pyramid [24]. A single beam trap was demonstrated using
two axicons and a spherical lens to generate a conical hollow beam propagating upwards
[25]. Such gravito-optical traps are limited to weak conﬁnement. Traps in which light
provided the conﬁnement in all directions were developed with hollow beams. Laguerre-
Gaussian “doughnut” modes were used, together with additional plug-in beams, to form
such a trap [26].

Several dark traps based on a single laser beam were demonstrated, providing
grater experimental simplicity and enabling dynamical changes of the trap geometry
and strength. As opposed to the 2D case, were any desired light distribution can be
generated using diﬀractive or refractive optical elements, there is no simple procedure
to design an arbitrary 3D light distribution [27, 28]. Nevertheless, through the use of
refractive and holographic optical elements, it is possible to produce light distributions
which are suitable for trapping atoms in the dark using a single laser beam. Such light
distributions, which comprise of a dark volume completely surrounded by light, were
realized using either combinations of axicons and spherical lenses, diﬀractive optical
elements, or rapidly scanning laser beams.

In the ﬁrst scheme realized, the trapping beam was produced by passing a Gaussian
beam through a phase plate of appropriate size, which shifted the optical phase at the
center of the beam by π radians. Interference leads to a dark volume at the focus of
the lens, surrounded by light in all directions [29]. An additional method, with a much
larger volume and more symmetric shape, was realized by simultaneously focusing two
diﬀraction orders of a properly designed binary phase element, consisting of concentric
phase rings with a π-phase diﬀerence between subsequent rings [30]. An improved trap
conﬁguration was demonstrated by adding an axicon telescope before the phase element
of the above setup [31]. This conﬁguration maximizes the trap depth for a given laser

Hyperﬁne Spectroscopy of Optically Trapped Atoms

power and trap dimensions, and greatly reduces the light induced perturbations to the
trapped atoms. A related scheme was demonstrated in references [32] and [33]. Finally,
a tightly-focused rapidly-rotating laser beam was used to create a trap [34]. If the scan
frequency is high enough, the optical dipole potential can be approximated as a time
averaged quasi-static potential. For a blue-detuned laser beam, and a radius of rotation
larger than the waist of the focussed beam, a dark volume suitable for 3D trapping is
obtained.

2.4. Photon Scattering and Coherence Relaxation in Multi-Level Atoms

The dipole potential can be viewed as originating from cycles of absorption of a photon
and stimulated emission into a diﬀerent laser mode. This process is unfortunately
in which the absorption is followed by
accompanied by spontaneous scattering,
spontaneous emission in a random direction. Spontaneous scattering is one of the main
limiting mechanism for the atomic hyperﬁne coherence
k

Spontaneous scattering is a two-photon process, in which an atom initially at a
F, mF i

of some excited level. The atom then decays back to the ground state, to a ﬁnal

. If F ′′ = F and m′′F = mF , the process is called “Rayleigh scattering”.

Otherwise, it is denoted “Raman scattering”. Clearly, Raman events destroy the atomic
state coherence and hence are detrimental to the spectroscopy. As will be discussed
below in section 12, also Rayleigh scattering events can be destructive for spectroscopy
of a trapped ensemble.

F ′′, m′′F i
then to calculate the rate of transitions γF,mF
the amplitudes for all possible paths must be summed. For rubidium atoms, these
are the two excited states 52P1/2 and 52P3/2, with all their diﬀerent hyperﬁne levels and
corresponding Zeeman sub-levels. We further assume that the laser polarization is linear,
hence conservation of angular momentum dictates mF = m′F . The total transition rate

A word of caution is in order about our use of the terms “decoherence” and “dephasing” . Decoherence
k
results from the dissipative interaction of a single quantum superposition state with the environment
(e.g.
in the case of trapped atoms, the coupling to the electro-magnetic vacuum which leads to
spontaneous scattering of photons). In addition, the response of a macroscopic ensemble of quantum
systems (each prepared in a superposition state) decays due to the dephasing between the microscopic
systems resulting from local variations in their evolution, and hence the ensemble coherence is lost.

The ﬁrst step in spectroscopy of trapped 85Rb atoms, is to transfer the entire
population to F = 2. There, it is distributed uniformly between mF levels. We then
apply a certain microwave pulse sequence (e.g. a Rabi pulse) which acts only on the
transition
, since a bias magnetic ﬁeld is applied
i
to shift all other transitions from resonance. Finally, we detect the total population
of F = 3. We would like to measure, independently, the rate of incoherent scattering
events that also aﬀect the population of F = 3, in order to subtract them from our
coherently driven population changes. Experimentally, we can measure the amount of
F -changing transitions, but not the rate of Rayleigh scattering events, or Raman events
that do not change F [10]. Equation 16, together with the appropriate summation, is
used to calculate the relative amount of diﬀerent scattering processes. For example,
the rate γF =2
F =3 for a transition between hyperﬁne levels 2 and 3 is calculated by
→
F over initial mF levels of F = 2, and summing over ﬁnal m′′F
averaging γF,mF
levels of F = 3. The total scattering rate is given by summing over mF levels of F = 2
and m′′F levels of F = 3. Figure 2 shows a calculation of the relative amount of these
two processes, as a function of the laser wavelength. Using the results of ﬁgure 2 we
calculate the total amount of scattering events out of our measurement.

Note, that for a detuning larger than the ﬁne-structure splitting of the excited state
(15 nm in rubidium), a destructive interference exists between the transition amplitudes
for Raman scattering, summed over the intermediate excited states [10]. In this case,

most spontaneous scattering events leave the internal state of the atom unchanged.

2.5. Light Shifts and Dephasing in Multi-Level Atoms

For a real multi-level atom, the light-shifts described in section 2.2 depend, in general,
on the particular substate of the atom. The equivalent of equation 14 in the case of a

However, the light shift is inversely proportional to the trap laser detuning, which diﬀers

hyperﬁne states “feel” diﬀerent trap shapes. For microwave spectroscopy of a thermal
ensemble this results in a rapid decay of the ensemble-averaged spectroscopic signal as
a consequence of dephasing, much faster than the decay due to spontaneous scattering
of photons.

3. Experimental Setup

All the experiments described in this tutorial consist of three stages. During the ﬁrst
stage standard laser-cooling techniques are used to cool an ensemble of 85Rb atoms
and load a portion of them into a far-oﬀ-resonance trap. During the second stage, all
the nearly-resonant laser beams are shut-oﬀ leaving only the far-oﬀ-resonance trapping

beams are used for the diagnostics. In this section, a detailed description of the above
steps is provided.

3.1. Laser Cooling and Trapping

The heart of our setup is a vacuum chamber connected to a small reservoir of rubidium
atoms through a valve. The chamber has six big windows used for the laser beams,
and two additional small windows used for imaging the atomic cloud with an intensiﬁed
CCD camera and measuring the ﬂuorescence signal with a photomultiplier tube (see
ﬁgure 3).

The ﬁrst step in all the experiments described here is a magneto-optical trap (MOT)
[7]. The MOT laser beams consist of three orthogonal pairs of counter-propagating
beams, detuned approximately

time-scales between the fast transverse oscillations and the very slow longitudinal ones
is used in the analysis of some of our experiments to neglect the longitudinal motion,
which is essentially frozen during the duration of the experiment, and hence to treat the
system as a two-dimensional one.

F = 3 are in general populated by spontaneous scattering of photons from the trapping
laser, which always accompanies the dipole potential and tends to destroy the atomic
coherence (see section 2). A simple way to measure the amount of photon scattering
is by measuring the spin relaxation caused by spontaneous Raman scattering [10, 29].
This is a very useful experimental technique which enables to measure even very low
scattering rates. For this measurement, the trapped atoms are ﬁrst prepared in the
lower hyperﬁne level of the ground state, F = 2. The number of atoms in F = 3 after
a variable time t, N3 (t), is measured by detecting the ﬂuorescence after a short pulse
of a resonant laser beam. The fraction of Raman scattering events out of the total
photon scattering events can be calculated using the known matrix elements for the
transition, and therefore the total amount of photon scattering can be inferred from the
spin relaxation measurement (see section 2.4).

We calculate the microwave driven part of the population by subtracting from the
measured signal the above contribution due to F -changing Raman transitions induced
by the trap laser and normalize to the signal after a short π-pulse, which transfers the
whole population of

4. Microwave Spectroscopy in a Dipole Trap: A Classical Model

We drive the magnetic-insensitive transition with a nearly-resonant microwave ﬁeld, and
apply a static magnetic ﬁeld in order to shift all other (magnetic sensitive) levels out
of resonance. In such case, and neglecting for the moment the eﬀects of the trap on
the atoms, we can consider a two-level system, separated in energy by EHF = ~ωHF.

ωHF is the microwave detuning, and we have
used the rotating wave approximation. As a function of the interaction time, an atom
oscillates between the two states at the eﬀective Rabi frequency, where the contrast of
the oscillation is determined by the Rabi frequency and the detuning. This sinusoidal
population transfer is referred to as Rabi ﬂopping. If the interaction time is ﬁxed and the
power is varied, P
reaches a maximum for ΩMWt = π. For such a pulse, the transition
probability as a function of frequency has a maximum for ωMW = ωHF, and (FWHM)
0.8/t. A measurement of the resonance frequency using a single
width of ∆ω/2π
pulse of constant duration is called Rabi spectroscopy. Figure 4 shows a Rabi spectrum
of cold atoms freely falling after the shut oﬀ of the cooling and trapping beams. The
pulse duration is limited by the falling time of the atoms from the detection volume. For
this short pulse we observe a Fourier-limited linewidth, indicating that no decoherence
or dephasing mechanisms exist for for free-falling atoms in this time-scales.
An alternative and widely used method is Ramsey spectroscopy,

in which two
consecutive pulses of duration t, separated by a “dark” period of duration T , are used.
The ﬁrst pulse (called a π
2 pulse) puts the atoms in a quantum superposition of both

≈

Hyperﬁne Spectroscopy of Optically Trapped Atoms

states. During free evolution, due to the detuning of the driving ﬁeld from resonance,
these two states develop a relative phase in the rotating frame of the ﬁeld. The second π
2
pulse causes the two states to interfere, thus translating phase diﬀerences into population
diﬀerences. If the ﬁeld frequency is scanned, the phase diﬀerence acquired in the dark
period, and thus also the population of the levels after the second pulse, oscillate.

When performing Rabi or Ramsey Spectroscopy on optically trapped atoms, the
above treatment no longer holds. The dipole potential is inversely proportional to the
detuning of the trapping laser beam from resonance. Since there is a slight diﬀerence in
potential for atoms in diﬀerent hyperﬁne states, the external (center of mass) potential
depends on the internal (spin) state, hence the internal and external degrees of freedom
cannot be separated.

We ﬁrst consider a simple model of Rabi spectroscopy, in which we assume the
atoms to be in thermal equilibrium in the potential of the trap and frozen in position
during the microwave pulse. In order for this model to be valid, the microwave pulse
duration t must be much shorter than the typical oscilation time in the trap, i.e.

For a trapped atomic ensemble, averaging over the diﬀerent values of U(r) causes
a shift in the ensemble averaged transition frequency ,

function of the trap’s geometry, which determines the degree of exposure of the atoms
to the trapping light. Following references [9] and [15], we introduce the parameter

5. Case Study: Inhomogeneous Broadening and Trap Geometry

As a speciﬁc example for the use of the classical model presented in the previous section
we compare the performance of four diﬀerent trap geometries. One trap is red-detuned
(the crossed Gaussian beams trap [12]), and three are blue-detuned: the Rotating Beam
Trap (ROBOT) [34] is based on a repulsive optical potential formed by a tightly focused
blue-detuned laser beam which is a rapidly scanned using two perpendicular acousto-
optic scanners. The Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) trap [26], consists of a hollow laser beam
(LG3
0) and two additional “plug” beams that conﬁne the atoms in the propagation
direction of the hollow beam. Finally, the“optimal trap” [31] uses two refractive axicons
and a binary phase element to create a spatial light distribution consisting of two hollow
cones attached at their bases and completely surrounding a dark region.

−

Figure 5 shows the calculated optical potential distribution of three of these traps,
in the r
z plane. The dashed lines in ﬁgure 5 are equidistant contours of equal potential,
and the solid one is the contour line corresponding to the trap depth. We assume a trap
laser with a ﬁxed power P = 1W and a sample of 85Rb atoms, which are laser cooled
to a temperature of 5 µK, and form a nearly spherical cloud with a radius of 0.5 mm,
typical parameters for a magneto-optical trap.

Adopting a criteria of > 90% geometrical loading eﬃciency from the magneto-
optical trap, we choose a radius r = 0.5 mm for all dark traps. The beam waist is
chosen as w0 = 50 µm for the ROBOT, and w0 = 10 µm for the optimal trap. The
length of the latter is an independent parameter, chosen as L = 3 mm to optimize
the power distribution as explained in reference [31]. We neglect the enhanced loading
eﬃciency of red-detuned traps [38], and assume for the crossed trap w0 = 0.6 mm, which
corresponds to > 90% overlap with the magneto-optical trap + [12].

The detuning in the comparison is chosen such that the depth of each trap is 3
times larger than the mean kinetic energy of the atoms. Since a ﬁxed laser power
is assumed, less eﬃcient traps would require a smaller detuning to provide the same
In table 5, the calculated required detuning in each of the diﬀerent

traps, with the parameters discussed above, is presented together with the calculated
darkness factor κ. As expected, all blue-detuned traps have a better darkness factor
than the red-detuned trap. The optimal trap has a signiﬁcantly better darkness factor
(κ = 0.02) than all other schemes, due to its very thin walls and nearly minimal surface
to volume ratio. Next, the mean spontaneous photon scattering rate
, and the
inhomogeneous hyperﬁne frequency broadening σ(ωHF) are calculated using equations
29 and 30, respectively. Here, the advantage of the optimal trap is even much larger,
since the improved darkness factor is combined with the eﬃcient distribution of optical
power that enables an increased detuning for the same trap depth. For example, the
inhomogeneous broadening in the optimal trap is only 47 Hz, while for all the others is
of the order of a few KHz.

Including gravity in our calculations, results in an increase of 10-60% for the
scattering rate and inhomogeneous broadening for rubidium atoms in the above dark
traps. For the lighter alkali-metal atoms (e.g. sodium and lithium), the inclusion of
gravity yields an increase of no more than 5% in the scattering rate.

Our classical model and the above comparison show that, in addition to the use
of far-oﬀ-resonance lasers and dark optical traps, geometry can also be exploited to
minimize the undesired exposure of the atoms to the trapping light.

6. A Compensated Trap

The previous section indicated that even for far detuned traps with favorable geometries
the hyperﬁne coherence of optically trapped atoms is still predominately limited by the
diﬀerence in the trap-induced ac Stark shifts between the two hyperﬁne levels. To cancel
these relative ac Stark shifts, we introduce an additional laser beam, with intensity I ′ (r)
and frequency between the resonant frequencies of the two ground state hyperﬁne levels,
ωHF/2 and +ωHF/2 from the lower and higher hyperﬁne level
say in the middle, i.e.
respectively∗. The total shift is obtained by adding the shifts from the trap and the
2 , yielding
∗ The detuning of the compensating laser can be chosen in the range
a straightforward modiﬁcation of equations 35,36; however, choosing δ = 0 minimizes spontaneous
photon scattering.

a more general method which does not require the existence of a “magic wavelength”,

7. Energy Selection

In this section we present a method for increasing the coherence time in an optical
trap, by narrowing the energy distribution of the trapped ensemble using a microwave
“pre-selection”. First, all the atoms are optically pumped into F = 3, where they
are distributed among the diﬀerent mF states. Then, a weak “selection” π-pulse, with
frequency ωs and duration ts (and hence FWHM spectral width ∆ωs/2π
0.8/ts, see
section 4), is applied. As a result, a subset of the atoms in
, composed of those
atoms having resonance frequency in the vicinity of ωs, is transferred to the lower
). Since the resonance frequency is a monotonic function of energy,
hyperﬁne state (
this selection can be viewed as an energy selection of atoms in the trap, i.e. an energy
band is selected around the energy Es. Next, a strong and short laser pulse resonant
transition ejects all the “unselected” atoms
with the
from the trap without causing any eﬀect on the “selected” atoms. The end-result of

the energy of the atom in the trap. With our technique, it is possible to select a narrow
energy band around any central energy, enabling, for example, to maximize the number
of selected atoms (for a given energy width) by selecting the energy with the highest
density of thermally populated states. For example, assume a 3D harmonic trap for
E2. If the trap is populated with an atomic
which the density of states obeys g(E)

We perform a proof-of-principle experiment of the energy-selection scheme, using

and a wavelength λ = 810 nm (See section 3). In order to probe the resulting energy
distribution, we perform Rabi spectroscopy of the remaining atoms using a 20 ms
microwave pulse. As seen in ﬁgure 10, the spectrum of atoms selected with a short

In a similar way to the “echo” spectroscopy of section 10 below, any broadening of
the narrow selected energy-slice as a consequence of diﬀerent eﬀects, such as photon
scattering and trap instabilities, can be very instructive on the eﬀects causing the
broadening. For example, a change in the trapping potential after the selection pulse
and before the measurement, will result in a line-shape that reﬂects the trap’s local
density of states (LDOS) [43].

8. Microwave Spectroscopy in a Dipole Trap: A Quantum Model

The classical model of section 4 fails to completely describe the spectroscopic properties
of the trapped atoms. As an example, ﬁgure 11 shows that for a powerful and
long enough pulse, the resonance line in a Rabi spectrum of trapped atoms develops
sidebands, which are, as we shall show next, a clear evidence of the quantization of the

motional levels in the trap.

In reference [11], a semi-classical, dynamic model was used, in which the center-
of-mass motion of the atoms is solved, and the phase is integrated over the classical
trajectory of the atoms. The total signal is obtained by averaging over the diﬀerent
trajectories. The validity of this model is not clear, since it assumes the same classical
trajectory for particles in diﬀerent internal states. Such a model ignores the separation of
trajectories with same initial conditions due to the diﬀerence in potentials, and predicts
longer coherence times than the measured ones [11].

We present in this section a quantum-mechanical

treatment of microwave
spectroscopy in an optical dipole trap. The existence of a diﬀerence in potential for
atoms in diﬀerent hyperﬁne states, means that the external (center of mass) potential
depends on the internal (spin) state, hence the internal and external degrees of freedom
cannot be separated and the entire Hamiltonian including both internal and external
degrees of freedom has to be considered:

primed numbers (see ﬁgure 12).

When a microwave ﬁeld VMW with frequency close to ωHF is applied, transitions
between the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian corresponding to diﬀerent internal states,
are driven
. The microwave ﬁeld acts only on the internal state of the atoms, hence the
matrix elements for the transitions can be written as the free-space matrix elements for
the internal state transition, times the overlap between the initial and ﬁnal vibrational
eigenstates, which correspond to diﬀerent Hamiltonians:

Now we can understand the result of ﬁgure 11. Non-vanishing matrix elements for
transitions to vibrational states with n′
= n show up as sidebands in the microwave
spectrum, if the pulse is long and weak enough so that the power broadening is smaller
than the typical level spacing. For a microwave pulse area corresponding to a π-
pulse (ﬁgure 11a) the sidebands are not visible, indicating that the matrix elements
for the sidebands are very small. Only for a stronger pulse (ﬁgure 11b), the sidebands
emerge. We veriﬁed that the sidebands are stronger for smaller values of the detuning,
= n′, as expected from the
and hence larger perturbation and larger
h
analysis. The coupling to diﬀerent vibrational levels, has a strong analogy to the Franck-
Condon factors in molecular spectroscopy. Note, that the near harmonicity of our trap
is responsible for the fact that the sidebands are seen even though many levels are
thermally populated.

Such quantum dynamics and in particular the decay of ﬁdelity or Loschmidt echo
in chaotic systems has been the topic of intense theoretical and numerical studies in
recent years (see for example references [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]),
mainly because ﬁdelity is also the standard measure for loss of information in quantum
computation [60]. However, experimental studies of chaotic and mixed systems are
still a missing chapter, since they require the preparation of highly-excited, pure
quantum states to avoid “spreading” these interesting eﬀects by averaging over an
inhomogeneously broadened system.

In conclusion to this section, Ramsey spectroscopy of optically trapped atoms
occupying a pure state can yield important information on their quantum dynamics
and in particular on the ﬁdelity (or equivalently the Loschmidt echo) as they are
perturbed by the small and well controlled diﬀerence in optical potential acting on
the two internal states. However, in most experiments and in ours in particular, pure
and highly excited states are practically inaccessible, and for thermal ensembles the
interesting quantum eﬀects are overwhelmed and completely smeared out by the rapid
inhomogeneous dephasing of the system. In the next section we show how an echo-like
scheme can suppress this inhomogeneous dephasing and enable us to directly measure
the quantum dynamics of thermal ensembles of optically trapped atoms.

The results of the previous section indicate that the decay of the Ramsey fringe contrast
is not only a ﬁngerprint of decoherence (an irreversible eﬀect) but also a consequence
of dephasing. Dephasing, which causes the ensemble averaged signal to decay, can
be reversed, at least partially, by stimulating an eﬀective “time reversal”, as has been
reported for spin echoes [61] and photon echoes [62, 63], and more recently for a motional
wave packet echo using ultra cold atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice [64]. We
achieve such reversal in dephasing by adding a π-pulse, which inverts the populations

2 -pulse even for a system that has dephased
completely before the π-pulse. The coherence echo is observed by seeing that all the

gravity, the revival at τ = 1.8 ms is complete. The lack of a perfect revival at τ = τosc
in ﬁgure 16, is due to the anharmonicity of the Gaussian trap. Note, that our technique
is sensitive enough to map the quantum dynamics of a system, due to a perturbation
approximately three orders of magnitude smaller than kBT .

For a suﬃciently long time τ the wave packet oscillations of ﬁgure 16 damp due to
a complete dephasing of the dynamics. At such a long time a simple expression for the
echo signal can be given. In particular, assuming random phases between all vibrational

This means that for 106 thermally populated states the relative energy shift needs to

will cause the two parts of the wave function generated by the ﬁrst π
2 -pulse to acquire
diﬀerent phases during the two “dark” periods of time τ , hence causing imperfect
interference at the time of the second π
2 -pulse. Examples of such mechanisms are
ﬂuctuations of the trap depth e.g. due to noise in the trap laser power [68], ﬂuctuations
in the bias magnetic ﬁeld giving rise to a ﬂuctuating second order Zeeman shift, and
spontaneous Rayleigh scattering of a photon from the trap laser. Rayleigh scattering of
photons does not lead to instantaneous loss of coherence, as does a Raman scattering
event [10]. Nevertheless, the recoil energy acquired by the atom can signiﬁcantly change
its vibrational level, and therefore its resonance frequency. The result is, again, a time-
dependent resonance frequency of the two level systems. Other heating mechanisms,
such as pointing instability of the trap laser beam, typically involve a much smaller
energy change than Rayleigh photon scattering, hence they induce a much longer time
scale for dephasing. The second type of mechanisms for decay of echo coherence (T1
processes) relates to the ﬁnite lifetime of the internal states of the atoms, which is limited
mainly by transitions induced by the trap laser light.

As stated above, dynamical T2 processes do not cause instantaneous decoherence,
but are characterized by a typical time scale over which a substantial phase diﬀerence
evolves. If the time between pulses τ is larger than this time scale, we expect the coherent
signal to disappear. The time τ can be reduced by adding more (equally spaced in time)
π-pulses between the two π
2 -pulses (see ﬁgure 19). If the decay of the echo coherence is
dominated by dynamical T2 processes, and the time scale for variations in the resonance
frequency is longer than τ , we expect a coherent signal to reappear [69]. The method has
a strong similarity with the “decoupling” method used in quantum information schemes
in NMR, where a repeated fast refocusing completely stops the dynamics (See reference
[70] and references therein).

a purely 2-level system. We attribute this to a weak population mixing between mF -
states within the same F -manifold as a consequence of spontaneous Raman scattering
and oﬀ-resonant stimulated Raman transitions involving two photons from the trap
laser. The net eﬀect of these transitions is to increase the population of the F = 3

population mixing eﬀect, we measure the population of F = 3 as a function of time

time coherence signal for a sequence with 10 π-pulses. Wave packet revivals appear for
τT otal =7 and 14 ms (i.e. a time between π-pulses of 0.7 and 1.4 ms) as expected for an
harmonic trap with our measured transverse oscillation time of 1.4 ms.

In ﬁgure 21 the coherence time τc is shown as a function of the number of π-pulses.
It is seen that the coherence time initially shows linear dependence on the number of
π-pulses and then reaches a maximum value of
65 ms, a 2.5 fold improvement as
compared to the simple echo coherence time. The maximum coherence time is given
by a trade-oﬀ between suppressing the dephasing due to T2 processes, by adding more
π-pulses, and the increased dephasing due to mixing to other vibrational states, that
the additional π-pulses induce.

The decay rate after the initial fast decay shows the residual decoherence, not
suppressed by the multiple-π scheme. We ﬁt the slope of the intermediate, nearly linear
section of the coherence decay curves with a straight line, and correct for the long time
slope (We show in ﬁgure 21 twice the slope since the decay of coherence contributes
only 1/2 to P
). We see that the addition of π-pulses improves the intermediate slope
by a factor of 6. However, as explained before, the initial mixing to other vibrational
levels prevents us from fully exploiting this improvement.

13. Quantum Dynamics and Chaos

The coherence properties of trapped atoms are related to their dynamics in the trapping
potential. Loosely speaking, the fact that the same electron which is probed by the
spectroscopy is used for the trapping, means that there is an inherent interplay between
dynamics and spectroscopy. Already at the ﬁrst demonstration of hyperﬁne spectroscopy
in a dark optical trap [11], it was conjectured that dynamics and spectroscopy are
coupled in dipole traps, and that the classical trajectories of the atoms in the trap aﬀect
the coherence time of a spectroscopic measurement performed on them. This interplay
between dynamics and spectroscopy means that precision spectroscopy in optical traps
can serve also as a sensitive probe of the dynamics.

The quantum manifestations of diﬀerent types of classical dynamics is still an issue
of unsettled debates, since the unitary evolution characteristic of quantum mechanics, is
inconsistent with the classical deﬁnition of chaos, i.e. an exponential sensitivity to the
initial conditions. A widely accepted signature of quantum chaos is the correspondence
between the spectral statistics of quantized classically chaotic systems and the one of the
canonical ensembles of random matrix theory [72]. An alternative approach is to look at
the stability of the dynamics with respect to small changes in the Hamiltonian, as ﬁrst
proposed by Peres [46]. In this framework, the “ﬁdelity” denotes the overlap between a
state evolved by a Hamiltonian H
with the same state evolved by a slightly perturbed
Hamiltonian H
[46]. Despite the renewed theoretical and numerical interest in the
ﬁdelity and its properties (see references [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]),
experimental studies in chaotic and mixed systems are still lacking, mostly due to

↓

the diﬃculty of preparing highly-excited pure quantum states. The use of “echo
spectroscopy” eliminates the need for pure quantum state preparation, since quantum
ﬁdelities can be experimentally observed even in a thermal ensemble and for extremely
highly excited quantum states.

As a speciﬁc example, we use in reference [65] “echo spectroscopy” to experimentally
measure quantum dynamics of ultra cold 85Rb atoms trapped in atom-optics billiards
[73, 74, 75, 76], with underlying chaotic or mixed classical dynamics. In this experiment
the trap is a light-sheet wedge billiard, made from two crossed blue detuned light sheets
deﬁning the billiard walls and where gravity conﬁnes the atoms in the vertical direction
[11]. The light sheets have in-focus (1/e2) dimensions of 20
250 µm, and by the use of
cylindrical lenses mounted on rotational stages, the wedge angle are adjusted in order
. The conﬁnement in the longitudinal direction is
to control the classical dynamics
k
provided by the diﬀraction of the beams. The very elongated shape of the trap allows
us to consider only the transverse motion and neglect the longitudinal one, which has a
timescale much longer than the experiment time. The temperature of the atoms is much
larger than the mean level spacing in the trap, and the atoms typically occupy many
108) states in the trap. The measured echo signal is the ensemble average of
(up to
all of them.

speciﬁc features, despite the fact that the underlying classical dynamics is chaotic. In

For larger perturbations a crossover to a regime where the decay is monotonic
In this regime the decay is independent of perturbation strength. The
is observed.
perturbation is large enough so the overlap of equivalent eigenstates is small, and this
indicates that the eﬀects of quantization of the trap levels should not play a role and
a classical description might be possible. Since the echo amplitude can be viewed as a
propagator [44], and in our system the thermal de-Broglie wavelength is much smaller
than the billiard’s dimensions, it is possible to use a semiclassical propagator [72]. It
is then seen that the classical trajectories contributing to the ensemble average of the
echo amplitude, are those that after evolving forward in time in H
, and then
backwards in time in H
, return to the vicinity of their initial position. These
trajectories we divide into two types: those that during this propagation hit the wall,
and those that do not. Since H
are highly diﬀerent mainly in the vicinity of the
wall, then the action integral along the ﬁrst type of trajectories will yield a very large
phase and the contribution from these trajectories to the ensemble average of the echo
amplitude will average out. However since the second type of trajectories does not feel
the diﬀerence between the potentials it will retrace its forward propagation backwards
in time causing the action integral to vanish. These trajectories will give a perfect
contribution. Therefore the echo amplitude in this regime simply measures the classical
probability that the particles have not yet hit the wall. Calculations of the echo signal

using this model yields good agreement with the experimental measurements.

14. Summary

∼

In this tutorial we present our experiments on the microwave spectroscopy of the ground
state hyperﬁne splitting of optically trapped atoms. We introduce a number of schemes
to overcome the inherent perturbation of the atomic levels by the trapping potential.

First, we present a simple, classical model and use it to analyze the light-
induced perturbations on optically trapped atoms, and in particular the inhomogeneous
broadening of the hyperﬁne splitting, for a number of trap geometries. An “optimal”
trap, achieved by minimizing the surface to volume ratio of the trap (to almost that of
a sphere) and by choosing the minimal wall thickness which is allowed by diﬀraction, is
shown to allow an atomic coherence time which is
200 longer than existing single-beam
dark traps, and

1800 times longer than red-detuned traps.

∼

Next, we demonstrate a scheme for eliminating the trap-induced inhomogeneous
broadening of the transition, by adding a weak “compensating” laser, spatially mode-
matched with the trapping laser and with a proper detuning and intensity. Despite
being tuned close to resonance, this laser induces a negligible change in the dipole
potential, and does not considerably increase the spontaneous scattering rate. With the
suppression of inhomogeneous broadening, the atomic coherence time is now limited by
the much smaller spontaneous scattering time. Whereas in a conventional optical trap
the ac Stark shift of the line center strongly depends on the temperature of the atoms,
which may drift considerably, in the compensated trap the suppression of the line shift
is equally eﬀective for all temperatures. Hence, it provides a means of achieving a higher
stability of the line center than that achieved by simply stabilizing the trapping laser
detuning and intensity. For relative spectroscopic measurements, such as the proposed
measurement of the electron’s permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) [78], only
stability (and not absolute accuracy) of the line center is of importance. For example, for
a 10 µK deep YAG-laser trap, and a compensating beam with a 15 KHz (time averaged)
5
frequency stability, locking the relative intensity between both beams to a 1 : 10−
stability, will result in

14 stability of the microwave line center.

10−

Conversely, we present a method in which a long microwave pulse is used to select
a narrow energy band from the atomic ensemble, around any central energy. The rest
of the atoms are expelled from the trap using an on-resonant laser, without perturbing
the selected atoms. With our method, the central energy can be chosen to maximize the
number of selected atoms by selecting the energy with the highest density of populated
states.

∼

We also demonstrate that a macroscopic coherence,

lost as a consequence of
dephasing of the diﬀerent populated vibrational levels, can be eﬃciently revived by
stimulating an echo if the trap detuning is large enough so
1 for
all thermally populated states. This suppression of dephasing due to perturbations
induced by the trap yields a dramatic increase in the coherence time for trapped

atoms, that may ﬁnd important applications for precision spectroscopy and quantum
information processing. We further demonstrate that echo spectroscopy can be used
to experimentally map the quantum dynamics of trapped atoms, showing a crossover
between quantum and classical regimes. In this way it can serve as an extremely sensitive
experimental tool for investigating quantum chaos in atom-optics billiards even when
more than 106 states are thermally populated, thereby avoiding the need of preparing
highly excited pure quantum states.

We demonstrate that the dephasing in microwave spectroscopy of optical trapped
atoms due dynamical changes in the trap parameters, or other similar processes, can
be suppressed beyond the suppression oﬀered by the simple echo, by using an improved
pulse sequence containing additional π-pulses. The achieved coherence time is limited
by increased mixing between transverse states and, to a lesser extent, the lifetime of
the internal states of the atoms. Both these factors are expected to be substantially
smaller for a trap laser with much larger detuning, such as in [68]. The demonstrated
pulse sequence may also ﬁnd use in precision spectroscopy of a periodic eﬀect, where
the π-pulses can be synchronized with the period of that eﬀect.

Finally, we show that “echo spectroscopy” can serve as an important tool for the
study of the properties of the ﬁdelity (or Loschmidt Echo) and its relation to the
underlying classical dynamics of a quantum system. The main diﬃculty in experimental
studies of these matters, is the preparation of highly-excited pure quantum states. This
diﬃculty can be tackled by using echo spectroscopy, which eliminates the need for pure
quantum state preparation and allows the experimental observation of quantum ﬁdelities
even in a thermal ensemble and for extremely highly excited quantum states.

A ﬁrst work in this direction in our experimental system was done in references
[44, 45]. Using a perturbative treatment we show that the coherence of the echo scheme
is a function of the survival probability or ﬁdelity of eigenstates of the atoms in the trap
[44]. The echo coherence and the survival probability display “system speciﬁc” features,
even when the underlying classical dynamics is chaotic. We performed echo spectroscopy
in chaotic and mixed atom-optics billiards, as a function of the perturbation strength,
and observed two diﬀerent regimes [45]. First, a perturbative regime in which the decay
of echo coherence is non-monotonic and partial revivals of coherence are observed,
as opposed to the prediction from random matrix theory. These revivals are more
pronounced in traps with mixed dynamics as compared to traps where the dynamics
is fully chaotic. Next, for stronger perturbations, the decay becomes monotonic and
independent of the strength of the perturbation. In this regime no clear distinction can
be made between chaotic traps and traps with mixed dynamics.

Some of the ideas presented here, have been found useful by other experimental
groups. A “compensating” technique has been used [79] to compensate the Stark shift
in an ion trap quantum processor. Recently, two other groups working on quantum
information processing with single ions and atoms have reported the use of coherence
echoes [80, 68].

The combined possibilities oﬀered by our experimental system (control of dynamical

Hyperﬁne Spectroscopy of Optically Trapped Atoms

phase-space and spectroscopy) can have impact on other ﬁelds of study: First, the eﬀect
of interactions between the particles trapped in a billiard is an interesting question in
the context of semiconductor quantum dots. In atom-optic billiards, the interactions
can be tuned in a controlled way, by changing the density of the trapped atoms or by
the use of a magnetic ﬁeld near a Feschbach resonance to change the atom’s scattering
length [81]. Next, open systems, which are characterized by a scattering matrix (and
not by eigenstates) can be investigated, and related to results in quantum dots, such
as universal conductance ﬂuctuations [82]. Finally, chaotic atom-optic billiards, which
their unique ability to move from the quantum to the classical regime, can be used for
experimental studies of parametrically-dependent Hamiltonians [83] and driven quantum
systems [84].

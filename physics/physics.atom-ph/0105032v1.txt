The eﬀects of Coherent excitation of a two level system
with a linearly chirped pulse are studied theoretically and ex-
perimentally (in Rb (5s - 5p)) in the low ﬁeld regime. The Co-
herent Transients are measured directly on the excited state
population on an ultrashort time scale. A sharp step corre-
sponds to the passage through resonance.
It is followed by
oscillations resulting from interferences between oﬀ-resonant
and resonant contributions. We ﬁnally show the equivalence
between this experiment and Fresnel diﬀraction by a sharp
edge.

Coherent excitation of atomic transitions is a general
phenomenon occurring whenever electromagnetic radia-
tion interacts with atoms. This interaction may result
in various kinds of processes, for example Rabi oscilla-
tions, free induction decay, adiabatic population transfer
and Coherent Transients (CT) [1]. By simply varying the
temporal shape of the pulses, a great variety of systems
can be manipulated such as spins in Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance [2] or atomic and molecular systems in coher-
ent control schemes [3]. We consider here the simplest
case of linearly chirped pulses where the ”instantaneous
frequency” drifts in time.

Depending on the frequency sweep and on the inten-
sity, adiabatic following can be observed with a signiﬁ-
cant population transfer. For example total population
transfer has been achieved via multilevel ladder climbing
[4–9] and Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage [10].

On the contrary if the adiabaticity criterion is not ful-
ﬁlled, the ﬁnal population depends crucially on the pulse
integral and CT dominate the interaction. This letter
presents theoretical and experimental studies of these
Coherent Transients. Although many works have dealt
with the transfer eﬃciency into the ﬁnal state, we report
here the ﬁrst direct observation of these transients on a
subpicosecond time scale. The CT result in oscillating
population. This is a signature of interferences between
resonant and non-resonant excitation. A detailed under-
standing of this behaviour is crucial to analyze pump-
probe experiments in which dynamics takes place on the
same time scale as laser interaction. Due to the diﬃculty
to control properly the laser pulses, the eﬀects of CT are
most often ignored [11].

Similarities can be found with optical CT observed in
the experiments of free induction decay or photon echoes
which provide relaxation rates [12–14]. In these experi-

ments, they observed on the transmitted optical signal, a
beat between initially induced polarisation of the medium
at resonance and a near-resonant laser. In the particular
case of a single chirped optical pulse, the beat frequency
increases linearly after passage through resonance, fol-
lowing the increase of resonance mismatch [15]. On the
contrary to these previous studies, the present report in-
volves CT directly observed on the population before re-
laxation becomes signiﬁcant. The beats result here from
interferences between the resonant and non-resonance ex-
citation paths. The passage through resonance does not
lead to total inversion [16]. Thus non-resonant excitation
can lead to population transfer after resonance. How-
ever, these extra contributions have a phase which varies
rapidly with respect to the phase of the dominant con-
tribution, leading to population oscillations.

In this letter, we describe theoretically the tempo-
ral evolution of the excited state population induced by
chirped pulse excitation in the low ﬁeld regime. The
CT oscillating pattern is experimentally studied on the
Rb (5s → 5p) transition. The 5p population is probed
”in real time” by a second excitation induced by an ul-
trashort pulse overlapping partially with the excitation
pulse. These results illustrate the relative importance of
the various stages of the interaction. Most of the pop-
ulation transfer occurs at resonance. The small frac-
tion of excited state amplitude transferred after reso-
nance leads to strong interferences, whereas interaction
before resonance results in negligible eﬀects.
In order
to point out the diﬀerent stages of the interaction, two
cases are investigated, the ﬁrst being when resonance is
reached at the middle of the interaction (on-resonance
case) and secondly when the resonance is reached earlier
(oﬀ-resonance case).

The excitation scheme is depicted on Fig. 1. A quan-
tum system with three states |gi,
|ei and |f i, of in-
creasing energies ¯hωg, ¯hωe and ¯hωf respectively, inter-
acts with two ultrashort laser pulses E1(t) and E2(t).
These laser pulses have carrier frequencies ω1 and ω2,
each one close to resonance with an atomic transition :
ωeg = ωe − ωg ≃ ω1 and ωf e = ωf − ωe ≃ ω2. Moreover,
these transitions are suﬃciently separated compared to
the laser linewidths (|ωf e − ωeg| ≫ ∆ω1, ∆ω2) so that
each laser can be assumed to interact with one atomic
transition only.

The ﬁrst laser pulse is obtained by frequency chirp-

∆ω1 . The second one is kept as short as possi-
ble in order to probe the transient population. Keeping
only the resonant component (within the rotating wave
approximation), the electric ﬁelds of the pulses are given

In this letter, we concentrate on the case where the pump
pulse is strongly chirped, so that τ1c ≃ 2φ′′
1 /τ1. More-
over, to measure the ”instantaneous” excited state pop-
ulation (in state |ei), the probe pulse is assumed to be
nearly Fourier transform limited (φ′′
2 ≃ 0), and of short
duration compared to the chirped pump pulse duration
(τ2 ≪ τ1c). This will ensure that the ﬁnal state popula-
tion (in state |f i) reproduces the |ei state population.

eﬃciency. As time increases from t0, new contributions
are added to the amplitude ae (t). These contributions
have a phase which increases more and more rapidly,
leading alternatively to an increase and a decrease of the
excited state amplitude.

In order to illustrate the coherent transients, an ex-
periment has been performed in Rubidium atoms. The
(5s - 5p (2P1/2)) transition (at 795 nm) is excited either
with a Fourier transform limited pulse or with a chirped
pulse. The laser bandwidth of ∼ 10 nm limits the exci-
tation of the other ﬁne structure component 5p (2P3/2))
transition (at 780 nm). The transient excited state pop-
ulation is probed on the (5p - ns,n’d) transitions with an
ultrashort pulse (at 607 nm).

The laser system is based on a conventional Ti: Sap-
phire laser with chirped pulse ampliﬁcation (Spitﬁre
Spectra Physics) producing 130 fs pulses around 795 nm
at a 1 kHz repetition rate with energy of as much as
800 µJ. Half of the light is used as the pump pulse. The
other half feeds a home made Non-collinear Optical Para-
metric Ampliﬁer (NOPA) [17] compressed with Brewster-
cut prisms, which delivers pulses of a few microJoules,
30 fs (after compression), centered around 607 nm. The
pump pulse is negatively chirped with a pair of grat-
ings (|φ′′
∼ 2. 105 fs2)), recombined with the probe pulse
and sent into a sealed rubidium cell with fused silica
Brewster-window ends (3 mm length). The cold ﬁnger
of the cell is maintained at about 80 ◦C, corresponding
to a pressure of 4. 10−5 mbar. The pump-probe signal is
detected by monitoring the ﬂuorescence at 420 nm due to
the radiative cascade (ns,n’d) → 6p → 5s collected by a
photomultiplier.

Figs. 2 and 3 present the experimental pump-probe
signals. Measurements have been performed for resonant
excitation (λ1 = 795 nm on Fig. 2) and for a central
wavelength detuned below resonance by roughly half the
laser bandwidth (λ1 ≃ 801 nm on Fig. 3). Each ﬁg-
ure presents a ﬂuorescence signal obtained with a chirp
of φ′′
1 = −4. 105 fs2 corresponding to a pulse duration of
11 ps. As a comparison, chirp-free data are displayed in
the insets.
In this latter case, the pump-probe signals
show a sharp step, with a short rise time correspond-
ing to the laser cross-correlation duration. On-resonance,

the two excited states corresponds to a ﬁne structure
wave packet which oscillates [18,19]. These oscillations
are well-known and not related to the present study.

Due to the smaller eﬃciency of the oﬀ-resonance exci-

tation (λ = 801 nm, Fig. 3), the ﬂuence was increased
to 110 µJ/cm2, inducing some power eﬀects. However,
experiments performed for diﬀerent ﬂuences show quali-
tatively the same behaviour.

In each case, the experimental curve is compared with
the numerical solution of the Schr¨odinger equation pro-
jected on the 5s, 5p (2P1/2, 2P3/2), 6d up to 10s states.
The comparison with the numerical resolution (where
this time origin is well deﬁned) has been used to ad-
just the relative time origins of the various experimental
data. Indeed, in the case of long chirped pulse, the exper-
imental determination of the time delay origin is a real
challenge via standard setup based on frequency mixing.
The CT scheme could provide an alternate experimental
determination of both time origin and long linear chirp
measurements. The only ﬁtted parameter is the value of
the chirp which diﬀers by less than 2% from the estimates

deduced from the geometry of the stretcher. An excel-
lent agreement on the oscillation pattern is obtained. The
contrast of the ﬁrst periods is well reproduced. It drops
more rapidly in the experiment. Several causes can be
invoked : residual spatial chirps or small incoherent com-
ponents of the pump pulse. After the sharp step, the os-
cillation frequency of the interferences increases linearly
with time : ωeg −ω1 (t) = t/φ′′
1 . For a pulse frequency be-
low resonance and a negative chirp, the passage through
resonance occurs at the beginning of the pulse. Thus the
major part of the pump spectral components contributes
after the resonance so that many oscillations result as
can be seen on Fig. 3. On the contrary, in the resonant
case, only the second half of the pulse contributes to the
interferences and fewer oscillations are observed.

An other way to explain the CT phenomenon is to ex-
amine the behaviour of ae (t) in the complex plane as
displayed in the insets of Fig. 4 for φ′′
1 = −8. 105 fs2.
Two examples obtained via a numerical resolution of the
Schr¨odinger equation are given. They correspond to the
experimental data shown on the same ﬁgure. The prob-
ability amplitude follows a double spiral starting from
(0, 0). Three regions can be distinguished. The two spi-
rals result from contributions before (I) and after (III)
resonance. The intermediate region (II : time inter-

to the population. This contribution is characterized by
a sharp increase of |ae (t)|, in an almost ”straight” di-
rection as expected from the stationary phase approxi-
mation applied to Eq. 1. The two spirals play diﬀerent
roles. The ﬁrst one (I) winds round the origin with an in-
creasing radius. The resulting probability increases thus
slowly and regularly. After resonance (III), a second spi-
ral winds round the asymptotic value leading to strong
oscillations. For a central laser frequency equal to the res-
onance frequency, the two spirals have the same weight
(Fig. 4a). Detuning of the laser frequency changes their
relative weight (Fig. 4b). For negative chirp and nega-
tive detuning, the second spiral (after resonance) has a
larger weight since resonance is reached during the ﬁrst
half of the pulse. This leads to a higher number of os-
cillations, as can be observed by comparing Fig. 2 and
3. Conversely, a negative chirp and positive detuning
reduces the number of oscillations.

The general expression of the excited state amplitude
(Eq. 1) presents strong similarities with Fresnel diﬀrac-
tion of a gaussian beam by a sharp edge. Eﬀectively, the
spirals displayed on Fig. 4 are similar to the well-known
Cornu spirals. In Eq. 1 the variable t corresponds to the
position of the sharp edge in the gaussian beam. With-
out detuning, Eq. 1 reproduces the classical diﬀraction
ﬁgure on axis. The eﬀect of detuning can be understood
by observing in a slant direction θ, with sin θ ∝ ∆ω.

Other analogies between time and space Fresnel

diﬀraction have been reported by several groups [20,21].
One example deals with two-photon absorption (or fre-
quency doubling) from a chirped pulse [20]. The spatial
coordinate was associated to the laser frequency instead
of the pump probe delay in our present case. By inserting
masks on the laser spectrum, the equivalent of a Fresnel
zone lens was reproduced in the spectral domain. The
frequency doubled pulse was thus spectrally focused. In
our case, pulse shaping of the laser pump pulse should
provide similar eﬀects as a Fresnel lens. For instance, by
slicing the temporal proﬁle of the pump pulse, it should
be possible to suppress the destructive interference con-
tributions to ae (t) and increase signiﬁcantly its asymp-
totic value.

accurate measurement of the chirp. This scheme can be
extended to nonlinear variations of the chirp which could
thus be measured in a direct way. Moreover, in pump-
probe experiments as well as in any experiment based on
a combination of ultrashort pulses, such coherent tran-
sients should be taken carefully into account to analyze
the data. Finally based on this phenomenon, new pulse
shaping schemes could be developed to improve the trans-
fer eﬃciency.

Abstract

We perform three-body calculation of direct muon-transfer rates from
thermalized muonic hydrogen isotopes to bare nuclei Ne10+, S16+, and Ar18+
employing integro-diﬀerential Faddeev-Hahn-type equations in conﬁguration

space with two-state close-coupling approximation scheme. All Coulomb po-

tentials including the strong ﬁnal-state Coulomb repulsion are treated exactly.

A long-range polarization potential is included in the elastic channel to take

into account the high polarizability of the muonic hydrogen. The transfer

rates so calculated are in good agreement with recent experiments. We ﬁnd
that the muon is captured predominantly in the n = 6, 9, and 10 states of
muonic Ne10+, S16+, and Ar18+, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION

A theoretical description of three-body charge-transfer reactions in physics is both chal-
lenging and interesting and is a subject of active research [1–8], as the study of this funda-
mental problem provides a testing ground of the underlying physical model. This is even
more so when the mass of the exchanged charged particle is not negligible compared to
the other two and when there is a strong ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction. The ﬁrst feature
invalidates the commonly-used simplifying Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation scheme
[2] and calls for a detailed three-body description. The second feature demands a proper
dynamical treatment of the ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction.

The direct muon (µ) transfer rates at low energies from the muonic-hydrogen isotopes

1Hµ (pµ) and 2Hµ (dµ) to bare nuclei XZ+ of large charge Z:

(Hµ)1s + XZ+

(Xµ)(Z−1)+ + H+

→

(1)

have been the subject of many experimental investigations [9–17], where H stands for the
hydrogen isotope proton (p) or deuteron (d) and XZ+ stands for the target nuclei. Investi-
gations of the low-energy muon-transfer reactions in collisions of muonic hydrogen Hµ with
nuclei XZ+ are of importance for the muon-catalyzed fusion cycle [18]. Although, there
have been many experiments of muon transfer with nuclei of large charge Z, the theoretical
investigations are limited to nuclei XZ+ with Z = 1 [7] and Z = 2 [8]. The theoretical
description of these reactions at low energies has both the complicating features mentioned
above and becomes extremely complicated as the charge Z of the nuclei increases. This is
due to the strong electromagnetic ﬁeld of the nuclei simultaneously responsible for a large
initial-state polarization and a strong ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction. Also, the large mass
of the transferred muon compared to the electron leads to additional diﬃculties compared
to the electron-transfer reaction where a Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation is eﬃcient
[2]. In addition, a large number of open channels in the muon-transfer reactions even at
zero energy complicates the theoretical treatment. It is diﬃcult to incorporate these eﬀects
properly in a dynamical three-body calculation. This is why there are no published work
to date on a three-body dynamical calculation of these muon-transfer rates for nuclei with
charge Z > 3. These aspects demand a careful three-body quantum mechanical treatment
with exact inclusion of the ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction.

The recent theoretical activities in charge transfer are centered around problems with
much weaker polarization and Coulomb interactions compared to those encountered in muon
transfer involving bare nuclei like argon or sulphur. In electron-hydrogen-atom [1], deuteron-
hydrogen-atom [2], positron-hydrogen-atom [4], electron-positronium-atom [5], hydrogen-
positronium-atom [6] and H-µ-H [7] systems the ﬁnal-state Coulomb interactions are zero
compared to 17e2/ρ in the case of p-µ-Ar18+ considered here, where e is the electronic charge
and ρ is the radial separation in the ﬁnal state. In proton-deuteron [3] and H-µ-He [8] systems

2

there is a small ﬁnal-state Coulomb repulsion, e.g., e2/ρ. The initial-state polarization is
also much smaller in those studies [1–8]. The large charge of the bare nuclei complicates
substantially the analysis of the present muon transfer problems.

Recently, we presented a theoretical formalism for the study of such muon-transfer reac-
tions using two-component integro-diﬀerential Faddeev-Hahn-type equations [19] in conﬁg-
uration space with close-coupling approximation scheme [20], and applied it to the study of
muon transfer from muonic hydrogen isotopes to He2+ and Li3+ [21], and C6+ and O8+ [22].
The transfer rates λZ calculated there are in good agreement with experiments, whenever
available. The formalism of Ref. [22] seems to be appropriate for the study of the problem
of muon transfer from muonic hydrogen isotopes to nuclei with large charge.

Among such transfer reactions, muon transfers from muonic hydrogen isotopes to Ne10+,
S16+, and Ar18+ have been the center of active interest to diﬀerent experimental groups.
There have been several experiments for muon transfer from pµ to argon which yielded

of argon is quite controversial with widely diﬀerent values for the transfer rates, specially in
the case of pµ. Despite this intense experimental activity in these muon-transfer reactions
there are no quantum dynamical calculations valid at low energies for these transfer rates.
In view of the above interest and controversy, in this paper we undertake the challenging
three-body study of direct muon transfer from pµ and dµ to argon using the formulation
of Ref. [22]. To test our approach, in addition, we apply it to study muon transfer from
hydrogen isotopes to neon and sulphur where experimental results are available. In the case

Although there is a very large number of open channels in these problems, for a given
nuclei the muon is transferred predominantly to a few (muonic) atomic labels of the heavy
nuclei XZ+ [23–25]. For example, it was ﬁrst noted by Gershtein [25] and reconﬁrmed later
[22] that the muon is captured mostly in the n = 4 states of C6+, and n = 5 states of O8+
[17,22]. Also these transfers take place mostly to the ﬁnal muonic-atomic states with low
angular momenta and transfer rates are negligible for muonic atomic states with angular
momenta l > 2. Semiclassical description of these muon transfer reactions has been very
useful in explaining many qualitative and quantitative features [24,26]. Using a semiclassical
model based on potential curves of the two-centered pµXZ+ system, Holzwarth et al. [23]
demonstrated that muon transfer to F9+ takes place essentially to the n = 6 level of the
(Fµ)8+ system. They also showed that transfer to the nearby levels of the (Fµ)8+ atom is
negligible compared to the n = 6 level. From similar consideration of semiclassical barrier

n denotes the integral part. For C6+, O8+ and F9+ this formula leads to n = 4,

5, and 6, respectively, in agreement with calculation [23,25]. The formula (2) is expected
to work even better for heavier nuclei Ne10+, S16+ and Ar18+ where the channelization to a
ﬁnal speciﬁc state n should be more perfect with muon transfer to nearby n states heavily
suppressed.

The correct dynamical formulation should include all open transfer channels and we in-
cluded them in a previous study on muon transfer with light nuclear targets [21]. However,
it is quite impossible now to treat even this reduced number of open transfer channels in a
quantum calculation with heavier targets due to convergence diﬃculties in the presence of
the large ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction mentioned above. Hence, in the present treatment
we use a two-channel model to calculate transfer to a single ﬁnal state, where we include
the elastic and one transfer channel. Diﬀerent sets of equations are used for the diﬀerent
ﬁnal states. Eventually, the total transfer rate is calculated by summing the diﬀerent con-
tributions. After calculation we ﬁnd that in both cases (pµ and dµ) the muon is captured
predominantly in the n = 6 state of Ne10+, n = 9 state of S16+, and n = 10 state of Ar18+
in complete agreement with formula (2) and in this pioneering theoretical study we present
results for these cases. The transfer is highly suppressed to other values of n and higher l
states.

In the Faddeev-Hahn-type equation [19], the wave function is broken up into components
with proper asymptotic behavior in diﬀerent physical channels. Consequently, these wave-
function components are much smoother functions of conﬁguration-space variables than the
Schr¨odinger wave function which is the sum of all these components. Hence, this approach
simpliﬁes the solution procedure and the correct asymptotic behavior of the solution in dif-
ferent channels can be incorporated easily. In addition, these equations allow us to introduce
explicitly a polarization potential in the initial channel. All Coulomb potentials including
the strong ﬁnal-state Coulomb repulsion are treated exactly (without approximation or pa-
rameters) in this formalism. The eﬀect of strong polarization of the muonic hydrogen by
the bare nuclei is accounted for by a polarization potential with a cut oﬀ parameter. By a
proper inclusion of the polarization potential in the intermediate region, the present transfer
rates are found to be essentially independent of this parameter. The correct inclusion of the
ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction has the advantage of building in the proper asymptotic be-
havior of the wave function in a low-order close-coupling type approximation [27,28]. Hence
as in Ref. [22] we make a two-state close-coupling approximation to the Faddeev-Hahn-type
equation in the present study and ﬁnd that a numerical solution using the present scheme
leads to very encouraging agreement with recent experimental transfer rates.

The theoretical framework for the present study is based on the formalism developed in
Refs. [20–22] which was used for the study of muon transfer from muonic hydrogen atoms
to lighter charged nuclei H+, He2+, Li3+, C6+, and O8+. In the dynamical equations in Refs.
[21,22] the ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction in the transfer channel is treated exactly without
approximation. In addition, as in Ref. [22], here we explicitly include a polarization potential
in the elastic channel. The presence of the strong Coulomb interaction and the associated
large polarization make the present calculational scheme far more complicated numerically
compared to those of Refs. [21,22]. In a coupled-channel approach for atomic processes, the
coupling to inﬁnite number of p-wave states is responsible for generating the polarization
potential [29,30]. As it is impossible to include all such states in a numerical scheme, the
commonly accepted procedure is to replace these coupling terms by the polarization potential
as in Ref. [31].

In Sec. II we present a brief account of the theoretical formulation. In Sec. III we report

the present numerical results and ﬁnally, in Sec. IV we present some concluding remarks.

II. THEORETICAL FORMULATION

A detailed account of the theory has already appeared [20–22]. For the sake of complete-
ness we report here a summary of the theoretical development. Here we describe the dynam-
ical equations we use based on the close-coupling approximation to Faddeev-Hahn-type two-
component equations [21]. We use units e = ¯h = mµ = 1, where mµ(e) is the muonic mass
(charge), and denote the heavy nucleus XZ+ by 1, the hydrogen isotope(s) by 2 and muon by
3. Below the three-body breakup threshold, following two-cluster asymptotic conﬁgurations
are possible in the system 123: (23)
2. These two conﬁgurations correspond
to two distinct physical channels, denoted by 1 and 2, respectively. These conﬁgurations are
determined by the Jacobi coordinates (~rj3, ~ρk): ~r13 = ~r3−
~r2,
~r1, where ~ri, mi (i = 1, 2, 3,) are coordinates
~r23 = ~r3 −
and masses of the particle i, respectively.

and zero otherwise. The value of the cut-oﬀ parameter Λ has to be chosen appropriately. By
adding equations (4) and (5) we ﬁnd that they are equivalent to the Schr¨odinger equation.
Distortion potentials are useful in phenomenological models of scattering in atomic
physics [31]. Although, unnecessary in a complete solution of the Schr¨odinger equation,
they facilitate the numerical eﬀort in a simpliﬁed model. We have included the proper po-
larization potential in the initial channel. Although, a polarization potential exists in the
ﬁnal rearrangement channel, the most important interaction in this channel is the Coulomb
repulsion which has been exactly included in our description.

Because of the strong ﬁnal-state Coulomb repulsion, it is very diﬃcult to solve the
multichannel model equations based on Eqs. (4) and (5). Hence, for solving (4) and (5) we
expand the wave function components in terms of bound states in initial and ﬁnal channels,
and project these equations on these bound states. The expansion of the wave function is

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We employ muonic atomic unit: distances are measured in units of aµ, where aµ is the
radius of muonic hydrogen atom. The integro-diﬀerential equations are solved by discretizing
them into a linear system of equations as in Refs. [21,22]. As we are concerned with the
low-energy limit, only the total angular momentum L = 0 is taken into account. Even at
zero incident energy, the transfer channels are open and their wave functions are rapidly
oscillating Coulomb waves. A large number of discretization points is needed for achieving
convergence.
First Eqs.

(10) and (11) are solved setting the polarization potential to zero. The
numerical convergence for the system of equations including the elastic and a transfer channel
(at a time) is obtained after moderate eﬀort. Finally, the total transfer cross section is
calculated by adding the results of diﬀerent two-channel contributions. In this case we need
up to 700 discretization points per channel adequately distributed between 0 and 70aµ.
This relatively large number of points is necessary to properly deal with the large ﬁnal-state
Coulomb interaction which could be as large as 17e2/ρ in the case of argon. Some 20 to
30 discretization points per channel would be enough for uncharged fragments in the initial
and ﬁnal state.

Next the calculations are repeated in the presence of polarization potential. It is more
diﬃcult to obtain convergence with the polarization potential (7) which is taken to be zero
at small distances below the cut oﬀ Λ. In this case to get numerical convergence we have to
up to 300aµ. We need up to 2000 discretization points
integrate to very large distances
per channel to obtain convergence. More points are employed near the origin and less at
large distances. For example, near the origin we take up to 60 equally spaced points per
30aµ) we take up to 8 equally
unit length interval aµ; in the intermediate region (ρ = 15
spaced points per unit length interval, and in the asymptotic region (ρ = 30
300aµ) we
take up to 6 equally spaced points per unit length interval.

low-energy muon-transfer rates from (pµ)1s and (dµ)1s to Ne10+, S16+, and Ar18+. We ﬁnd
in our calculation that in all cases the transfer takes place predominantly to the angular
momenta states l = 0, 1 of the n = 6 orbital of (Neµ)9+, n = 9 orbital of (Sµ)15+, and n = 10
orbital of (Arµ)17+. The transition to other states of (Xµ)(Z−1)+ is negligibly small. Hence in
this work we only present muon-transfer rates for the l = 0, 1 states of the above orbitals of

tot
/1010 s−1 with and without the polarization potential are presented in Tables I to V together
with the results of experimental works. In all cases the partial transfer rates without the
polarization potential saturates to a reasonably constant value for E < 0.01 eV. A similar
behavior is also observed in the presence of the polarization potential. In all cases presented,
the rate of transition to the s state of the muonic atomic orbital is larger than that to the p
state both in the presence and absence of polarization potential. For example, in the case of
Ne10+, the muon-transfer rate to the 6s state of (Neµ)9+ is larger than that to the 6p state,
and so on.

First we consider the results in Table I for muon transfer from muonic protium (pµ)1s
to Ar18+.
In this case we ﬁnd that a constant value for the transfer rate is achieved for
0.04 eV and we present results up to this energy. The present total transfer rate of
E
≤
1010 s−1 is in good agreement with experiments of Refs. [9–11]. However,
(12.9
it disagrees strongly with experiments of Refs. [12,13]. In the case of muon transfer from
(dµ)1s to Ar18+, we ﬁnd in Table II that the total transfer rate has decreased in this case
compared to that in Table I, in agreement with the observed experimental trend [9]. For the
rates reported in Table II a constant value is obtained for E
0.04 eV. The present total
1010 s−1 for (dµ)1s to argon is in reasonable agreement with the
transfer rate of (5.3
experimental rates of Refs. [9,14].

In the cases of muon-transfer rates from hydrogen isotopes to muonic sulphur and neon
reported below in Tables III, IV, and V, a constant value for the rate was not obtained till
E = 0.04 eV, as in the case of argon above. Hence in these cases we report the results of
our calculation for energies 0.01 and 0.04 eV with the experimental energy lying in between.

of Ref. [15].

From Tables I to V we ﬁnd that in most cases the transition rates calculated in the present
model without the polarization potential is already in reasonable agreement with experiment.
This suggests that the present model based on the close-coupling approximation to coupled
Faddeev-Hahn-equations is very suitable for muon transfer reactions with neon, sulphur, and
argon. A similar conclusion can be made from our previous study on muon transfer reactions
with hydrogen [20], helium, lithium [21], carbon, and oxygen [22]. Although, the eﬀect of
polarization in these cases is expected to be large on the observables of the elastic-channel
observables at low energies, this eﬀect is not found to be so pronounced on the muon-transfer
rates calculated in this work.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have calculated muon-transfer rates from muonic protium and deuterium to bare
nuclei neon, sulphur, and argon employing a full three-body quantum-mechanical description
of rearrangement scattering by solving the Faddeev-Hahn-type equations [19] using close-
coupling approximation. The exact inclusion of the ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction in the
rearrangement channel (without approximation) guarantees the correct asymptotic form
of the wave function in this channel. We also included a polarization potential at large
distances in the initial channel beyond a cut oﬀ distance Λ. In these problems the short-
range part of the interaction extends to about 20 muonic atomic units (25aµ). By varying
Λ in the intermediate range between 120aµ to 160aµ we ﬁnd that the transfer rates are
almost independent of the cut oﬀ Λ. This makes the reported transfer rates of this work
quasi-independent of cut oﬀ. It is shown that in the present approach, the application of
a close-coupling-type ansatz leads to satisfactory results for direct muon-transfer reactions
from muonic hydrogen to bare nuclei neon, sulphur, and argon. The present rates are in
good agreement with experiments [9–11,14–16]. Our calculation also reproduces the observed
experimental trend of transfer rates to sulphur and argon from protium and deuterium [9].
The transfer rate increases with the decrease of mass of the hydrogen isotope in the case of
argon; the reverse is true for sulphur.

It is interesting to note from the works of Refs. [20–22] and the present investigation that
a low-order approximation to the Faddeev-Hahn-type equations as considered here produces
very good muon-transfer rates from hydrogen isotopes to bare nuclei at low energies.
In
previous studies it was noted that low-order approximation to these equations also produces
very accurate scattering observables at low energies for electron-hydrogen [32] and positron-
hydrogen systems [27] in agreement with the variational results. It is well-known that similar
low-order approximation to the Schr¨odinger equation leads usually to poor results at low
energies [1,4,31]. Hence low-order approximation to the Faddeev-Hahn-type equations is
a very attractive alternative for studying low-energy Coulomb charge-transfer reactions in

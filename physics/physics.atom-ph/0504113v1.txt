We report on a method of light–shift engineering where a laser is used to tune the polarizability of
an excited atomic state. The technique is used both to selectively load a speciﬁc region of an optical
lattice and to enhance the loading of an optical trap. The results are explained by calculating the
diﬀerential light–shift of each hyperﬁne state. We conclude that the remarkable spatial selectivity of
light–shift engineering using an auxiliary laser provides a powerful technique to prepare ultra-cold
trapped atoms for experiments on quantum gases and quantum information processing.

Optical dipole traps and optical lattices are ﬁnding an
ever increasing range of applications in experiments on
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) [1, 2, 3, 4], optical
clocks [5], single–atom manipulation [6, 7], and quan-
tum information processing (QIP)[8, 9]. In many appli-
cations, one is interested not only in the light–shift of
the ground state, which determines the trap depth, but
also the relative shift of a particular excited state. One
has some control over this diﬀerential shift as the ground
and excited states have diﬀerent resonances, and the laser
can be tuned to a ‘magic’ wavelength where the ground
and excited state polarizabilities are the same [5, 7, 10].
However, using a ‘magic’ wavelength is not always ap-
propriate either because one is no longer free to select
the laser wavelength to minimize spontaneous emission,
or because of the unavailability of suitable light sources.
In this paper, we report on a diﬀerent method of light–
shift engineering where a second laser ﬁeld is used to
control the excited state polarizability. Light–shift engi-
neering using an independent laser could have signiﬁcant
advantages over the use of a ‘magic’ wavelength for some
applications, as it can be applied to speciﬁc regions of a
trap. For example, we show how the technique can be
used to selectively load a well deﬁned region of an optical
lattice. Speciﬁcally, we consider the case of loading 85Rb
atoms into a deep CO2 laser lattice. A quasi-electrostatic
lattice based on a CO2 laser (wavelength 10.6 µm) is par-
ticulary attractive for trapping cold atoms or molecules
as it combines low light scattering [11] with a lattice con-
stant suﬃciently large to allow single-site addressability
[12]. We show that by focussing an additional laser (a
Nd:YAG laser with wavelength 1.064 µm) on speciﬁc sites
of the lattice we can selectively load into only those sites.
This spatially selective loading is most eﬀective when the
cooling light is blue–detuned relative to the unperturbed
atomic resonance. We explain the eﬀect by calculating
the diﬀerential light-shifts between the ground and ex-
cited states in the presence of two light ﬁelds. We show
that only in the light–shift engineered region where the
CO2 and Nd:YAG laser beams overlap, is the diﬀerential

tion, we show that for red-detuned cooling light, light–
shift engineering produces a signiﬁcant enhancement in
the number of atoms loaded into a deep optical trap.

The experimental set-up employed to demonstrate con-
trolled loading by light–shift engineering is shown in
Fig. 1. An octagonal vacuum chamber ﬁtted with home-
made Zinc Selenide (ZnSe) UHV viewports [13] to accom-
modate the CO2 laser beams provides a background pres-
sure of 1.2×10−10 Torr. A focussed Nd:YAG beam, with
variable power, locally heats an alkali metal dispenser to
provide a controllable source of thermal 85Rb atoms [14].
A CO2 laser (propagating along z in Fig. 1) with power
45 W is focussed to form a waist (1/e2 radius) of 70 µm at
the center of the chamber. The output beam is collimated
and retro–reﬂected to form a 1D lattice. The intensity of
the CO2 laser is controlled using an acousto-optic mod-
ulator (AOM). The intensity at the center of the lattice,
I0 = 2.3 × 106 Wcm−2, gives a ground state light–shift
U0 = − 1
2 α0I0/(ǫ0c) = h(−36 MHz). A Nd:YAG laser
beam (propagating at +45◦ to the y axis in the xy plane)
with power 7.8 W is focussed by a f = 150 mm lens to
overlap with the CO2 lattice in the trapping region. The
Nd:YAG laser has a circular focus with a beam waist of
30 µm in the overlap region. This gives an intensity of
I0 = 5.5 × 105 Wcm−2 leading to a ground state light–
shift U0 = h(−18.6 MHz). The CO2 and Nd:YAG laser
beams are linearly polarized along the x and z axes, re-
spectively.

Loading of a CO2 laser lattice is carried out as follows:
The CO2 and Nd:YAG laser beams are left on through-
out the loading stage. We load a magneto-optical trap
(MOT), centered on the dipole trap, with 2 × 107 85Rb
atoms in typically 3 seconds. After the magnetic ﬁeld
is switched oﬀ, the cooling laser beam intensities are re-
duced from 55 mWcm−2 to 10 mWcm−2 and the detun-
ing is increased to ∆ = −8Γ, where Γ = 2π(6 MHz) is the
natural linewidth of the transition, to create an optical
molasses. After 10 ms of molasses, the atom cloud has a
typical temperature of 40 µK. During the molasses phase
the hyperﬁne repumping laser intensity is lowered from
6 mWcm−2 to 200 µWcm−2 and then switched oﬀ com-
pletely with a shutter for the ﬁnal 5 ms such that atoms
are pumped in the lower hyperﬁne state [15]. After the
molasses phase, the cooling light and the Nd:YAG laser
are extinguished for a few hundred milliseconds, then the
CO2 laser is turned oﬀ and the MOT beams (tuned to
resonance) are turned back on to image the cloud. A

region [19].

detunings (a) ∆ = 2π(−20 MHz) and (b) ∆ = 2π(+2 MHz).
For blue–detuning (b) only the light–shift engineered region
where the CO2 and Nd:YAG laser beams overlap is loaded.

Finally, we should add that the enhanced loading ob-
served in the overlap region cannot be explained simply
by the fact that the trap is deeper in this region. To
demonstrate this we have reduced the CO2 laser power
by a factor of four such that the depth in the combined
CO2 plus Nd:YAG trap is less than a CO2 lattice alone
at full power. Typical column densities are shown in Fig.
3. We see that the density in the combined trap is still
signiﬁcantly higher than for a deeper CO2 lattice.

FIG. 3: Column density for a CO2 laser lattice without the
Nd:YAG laser (dashed line), and for a shallower CO2 laser lat-
tice with the Nd:YAG laser (solid line). The overall ground
state light–shift in the overlap region of the shallow combined
trap (−27 MHz) is less than the maximum light-shift for the
CO2 laser lattice alone (−36 MHz), but loading into the com-
bined trap is still signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient.

To explain the spatially selective loading for blue–
detuned cooling light, we have calculated the polarizabil-
ity of the 5s and 5p states as a function of wavelength.
The details of the calculation will be explained elsewhere

tion of the CO2 and Nd:YAG laser beams. Inset: Schematic

spot sizes in the interaction region. (b) Observed enhanced
loading of the dipole trap (dark represents high density). The
image size is 1.54 × 0.33 mm with a viewing direction approx-
imately perpendicular to both the CO2 and Nd:YAG laser
propagation directions.

typical atom distribution viewed approximately perpen-
dicular to the CO2 and Nd:YAG beam axes is shown in
Fig. 1(b). One sees that the CO2 lattice loads eﬃciently
out in the wings where the trap depth is smaller. This
eﬀect has been widely observed in experiments on far-oﬀ
resonance optical dipole traps [12, 16, 17] and arises due
to the smaller diﬀerential light–shift between the ground
and excited states away from the focus. We also see that
the loading is greatly enhanced in the region where the
Nd:YAG laser intersects the CO2 laser lattice.

Remarkably, if we detune the cooling light slightly to
the blue of the unperturbed atomic resonance such that
neither the CO2 nor the Nd:YAG laser beams alone trap
any atoms, then we still observe that the region where the
two beams intersect is eﬃciently loaded, see Fig. 2(b).
This spatial selectivity provides a very clear demonstra-
tion of the power of light–shift engineering using an aux-
iliary laser ﬁeld. In addition, it demonstrates that the
enhanced loaded observed in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2(a) cannot
be explained by a ‘dimple’ eﬀect [18], where atoms from

[20]. Brieﬂy, the scalar polarizability α0 is the average of
the dipole polarizabilities αxx, αyy and αzz for an atom
exposed to a laser ﬁeld polarized, respectively, in the x,
y, and z-directions: α0 = (αxx + αyy + αzz)/3. The
scalar polarizability is the same for all m-components of
the 5p state. In addition, there is a tensor polarizabilty
α2 = (αxx − αzz) /3 which lifts the degeneracy of dif-
ferent m-states. In order to obtain these quantities, we
represent the interaction of the valence electron with the
core by the model potential proposed by Klapisch [21].
The polarizabilities are calculated by the implicit sum-
mation method [22]. Thus αxx (and similarly for αyy
and αzz) is obtained as αxx = −e(h0|x|1i + h0|x| − 1i)/F ,
where |0i represents the state vector of the unperturbed
5s, or 5p−1,0,1 states, and | ± 1i are such that

(E0 ± ~ω − H0)| ± 1i = eF x|0i.

(1)

Here H0 is the Hamiltonian of the ﬁeld-free model atom
and E0 is the eigenenergy of the unperturbed state, i.e.
H0|0i = E0|0i, and F is an arbitrary electric ﬁeld. These
equations are solved in position space by expanding the
wave functions on a discrete basis of radial Sturmian
functions and spherical harmonics [23].
In the zero-
frequency limit, the resulting values of α0[5s], α0[5p] and
α2[5p] converge towards 333a3
0, re-
spectively, in satisfactory agreement with previous exper-
imental and theoretical work [24]. The dynamic polariz-
abilities as functions of wavelength are shown in Fig. 4.
We ﬁnd that α0 = 722a3
0 at 1.064 µm, which agrees well
with experiment and other theoretical work [25, 26, 27].

FIG. 4: Calculated polarizabilities of the 5s and 5p states of
Rb. For the p state we show the scalar and tensor polariz-
abilities, α0 = (αxx + αyy + αzz) /3 and α2 = (αxx − αzz) /3,
respectively. For the s state, α0 = αxx = αyy = αzz.

For our purposes the most important result of Fig. 4
is that the polarizabilities of the 5s at the CO2 laser
wavelength (λ = 10.6 µm) and the Nd:YAG wavelength
(λ = 1.064 µm) have the same sign, whereas the polar-
izabilities of the 5p state have opposite signs. It follows

FIG. 5: The diﬀerential light–shifts asa function of position
along an axis perpendilualr to both the CO2 and Nd:YAG
laser propagation directions. The diﬀerential shift is the dif-
ference between the light–shifts of the ground state and the
mF = −4, . . . , +4 magnetic sub-levels of the 5p2P3/2(F = 4)
state in 85Rb for atoms in (a) the CO2 laser lattice only, and

that one can use a combination of CO2 and Nd:YAG
lasers to tune the diﬀerential light–shift between the 5s
and 5p states through zero. To calculate the light–shift
experienced by atoms in the combined CO2 plus Nd:YAG
trap we calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix [28, 29]

where U0 is a diagonal matrix with components cor-
responding to the hyperﬁne splitting, the index i de-
notes the CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers, and Qi

trix with components hF, mF |Qµ|F ′, m′
F i with Qµ =
[3 ˆJ 2
µ − J(J + 1)]/J(2J − 1) and Jµ being the electronic
angular momentum operator in the direction of laser ﬁeld
i. The diﬀerential light–shift between the ground state
and the 5p2P3/2(F = 4) state for the CO2 laser alone
is shown in Fig. 5(a). As a single laser beam splits the
states according to the magnitude of mF , there are ﬁve
curves corresponding to |mF | = 0, . . . , 4. We see that
all the levels are far blue-detuned (positive diﬀerential
shift) at the centre of the lattice, making laser cooling
ineﬀective. Adding the Nd:YAG laser produces the shifts
shown in Fig. 5(b). The Nd:YAG laser lifts the degen-
eracy between the ±mF components, although two pairs
of states remain close to degenerate. More importantly,
one pair of states is pulled down into the region of neg-
ative diﬀerential shift. This allows eﬃcient laser cooling
in the center of the overlap region, even when the cool-
ing light is slightly blue–detuned relative to the unper-
turbed resonance frequency. Note that, eﬃcient loading
for blue–detuning can only be explained if one includes

4

the tensor polarizability term α2. Although α2 is smaller
than the scalar polarizability (by a factor of 4 or 5), it
dramatically alters whether states see the cooling light as
red or blue detuned and therefore completely determines
whether the trap is loaded or not.

As light–shift engineering allows laser cooling to work
as eﬃciently as in free space one might expect to load
atoms at lower temperature than in conventional loading
schemes. To address this issue we need to increase the
sensitivity and the resolution of our imaging system to
allow accurate density and temperature measurements.
This will be the focus of future work.

To conclude, we have shown how light-shift engineering
using an auxiliary laser ﬁeld can be used to implement

spatially selective loading of deep far-oﬀ resonance opti-
cal lattices. We have performed theoretical calculations
of the atomic polarizabilities and have shown that the
addition of a second laser ﬁeld induces a splitting of the
excited state which is crucial in determining the eﬃciency
of loading into the combined trap. The technique could
be applied to load a single-site in 3D CO2 lattice, with
the interesting prospect of BEC in the limit of high trap
frequency.
In addition one could adapt the technique
to perform patterned loading of optical lattices [30] for
applications in QIP experiments.

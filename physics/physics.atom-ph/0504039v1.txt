Mesoscopic interference eﬀects in multiple scattering of photons depend crucially on the internal
structure of the scatterers. In the present article, we develop the analytical theory of multiple photon
scattering by cold atoms with arbitrary internal hyperﬁne multiplets. For a speciﬁc application, we
calculate the enhancement factor of elastic coherent backscattering as a function of detuning from an
entire hyperﬁne multiplet of neighboring resonances that cannot be considered isolated. Our theory
permits to understand why atoms behave diﬀerently from classical Rayleigh point-dipole scatterers,
and how the classical description is recovered for larger but still microscopic objects like molecules
or clusters.

INTRODUCTION

Atomic physics and quantum optics currently discover
the fascinating ﬁeld of mesoscopic physics [1]. Mesoscopic
phenomena are due to interference eﬀects that survive
a disorder average in phase-coherent samples. Interfer-
ence eﬀects can be observed using both genuine quantum
matter waves such as electrons or ultra-cold atoms and
classical waves such as acoustic or electromagnetic waves
[2]. Arguably, the most dramatic eﬀect is the break-
down of diﬀusive transport due to strong localization,
a phenomenon invoked by P.W. Anderson in the context
of the metal-insulator transition [3]. Strong localisation
has been observed unambiguously for electrons [4] and
microwaves [5] in quasi one-dimensional systems. Yet
even in dilute samples far from the dense regime where
strong localisation could be expected, interference eﬀects
can be measured. In optics, a rather robust interference
phenomenon is the coherent backscattering (CBS) eﬀect.
Here, the constructive interference between waves coun-
terpropagating along a given multiple scattering path
enhances the average diﬀuse intensity reﬂected from an
ensemble of random samples in a narrow angular range
around the backscattering direction [6]. Under optimal
experimental conditions allowing to apply the reciprocity
theorem [7], this two-wave interference enhances the in-
tensity exactly by a factor of 2 [8].

Quantum optical systems involving multiple scattering
of photons by atoms are well adapted to study general
concepts of quantum transport. Indeed, atoms are very
eﬃcient point scatterers for light because the scattering
cross-section close to an internal resonance is huge com-
pared to the actual atomic size. Laser-cooling techniques
permit to prepare low temperature clouds where a negli-
gible Doppler broadening of atomic transitions preserves
the phase coherence of the propagating photons. For
low enough laser intensity, photons are scattered com-
pletely elastically from closed atomic dipole transitions
such that inelastic scattering and absorption are absent
(see, however, [9] for saturation eﬀects at higher ﬁeld in-

tensities). Furthermore, by injecting and detecting well-
deﬁned photon polarization states, one is capable of prob-
ing the internal spin degrees of freedom of the atomic
scatterers.

The experimental observation of coherent backscatter-
ing (CBS) of laser light by cold atoms [10, 11] has re-
vealed the crucial impact of the internal atomic structure
onto coherent photon transport. Atomic dipole transi-
tions with a non-degenerate ground-state scatter photons
like isotropic point-dipoles (also known as Rayleigh scat-
terers) [12]. In general, however, photons probe dipole
transitions with rather high Zeeman degeneracy due to
large total angular momentum. It was shown theoreti-
cally that an average over all possible angular momentum
orientations then leads to an antisymmetric component
of the atomic scattering tensor which reduces the inter-
ference contrast of coherent backscattering considerably
[13, 14]. Indeed, in the absence of an external magnetic
ﬁeld, photons are scattered elastically by freely orientable
atomic dipoles just like electrons propagating in a sam-
ple of magnetic impurities (spin-ﬂip scattering), and in
this case interference corrections to the diﬀusive trans-
port picture are cut oﬀ very eﬃciently [15].

Previous analytical studies of the CBS double scat-
tering contribution from an inﬁnite atomic medium [14]
as well as the case of multiple scattering inside an in-
ﬁnite medium [15] treated an arbitrary single, isolated,
degenerate atomic dipole transition. This description is
a priori accurate if the hyperﬁne optical resonance un-
der consideration is suﬃciently far away from neighbor-
ing transitions and if the laser detuning is suﬃciently
small. However, Kupriyanov and coworkers [11] showed
that the CBS enhancement factor displays a slight asym-
metry as function of the probe frequency around the res-
onance that can only be accounted for by including the
other optical hyperﬁne transitions. In the framework of
their purely numerical calculation, they were not able to
give a qualitative explanation for the fact that the largest
asymmetry is observed in the h
h polarization channel
of preserved helicity and that the higher enhancement is

k

found towards the blue-detuned side of the transition.

Extending our previous results, we develop in the
present contribution an analytical theory for multiple
photon scattering from atoms with a statistical distribu-
tion over complete hyperﬁne multiplets. We rely on the
decomposition of the scattered intensity into irreducible
components with respect to the rotation group. This
method has been developed some time ago in atomic
physics [16, 17], but only today, with the advent of
laser cooling techniques, we can study subtle interfer-
ence eﬀects for the multiple coherent scattering of quasi-
monochromatic radiation. As an application, we calcu-
late the CBS enhancement factor as a function of probe
frequency for scattering from an inﬁnite half-space. This
choice is not meant to describe a realistic experiment but
minimizes the purely geometrical eﬀects of a ﬁnite optical
thickness that varies with the scattering mean-free path.
Our approach explains sign and magnitude of the asym-
metry observed in [11]. Furthermore, our theory permits
to describe precisely how the eﬀective degeneracy can be
reduced by tuning far from hyperﬁne- or ﬁne-structure
multiplets. This allows us to understand how more com-
plicated objects such as molecules or clusters, that in-
volve more and more transitions, eventually scatter light
as classical objects with an optimal interference contrast.
Therefore, we are able to bridge the gap towards eﬀective
theories for mesoscopic photon physics in systems with
classical scatterers [18].

In section II, we develop the general theory of multiple
photon scattering by hyperﬁne multiplets in the indepen-
dent scattering approximation. In section III, we discuss
the transition to classical scattering properties. Section
IV contains the limiting cases of purely elastic scattering
and the calculation of CBS from atoms with a hyperﬁne
multiplet of overlapping resonances. With section V, we
conclude the paper by indicating possible extensions of
the work.

II. ANALYTICAL THEORY

A. Theoretical description

We describe the photon ﬁeld for weak laser intensity
with wave vector k and
kǫ
by one-photon Fock states
i
|
transverse polarization ǫ. In units where ~ = c = 1, the
energy or angular frequency of this state is ω = k. The
scattering of these one-photon states by atomic dipole
transitions will be described following the lines of [14, 15]
while generalizing to multilevel transitions.

We consider atoms at rest which are initially prepared
in an electronic ground-state with angular momentum
J, but possibly in any sublevel F of the corresponding
hyperﬁne multiplet. The probe light frequency is near-
resonant with an electric dipole transition connecting the
electronic ground-state J to an electronic excited state
J ′ = J
1, J, J + 1. We assume here that the atom
ﬁne structure is well described by an LS-coupling scheme

FIG. 1: (color online) Typical level structure of an atomic
dipole transition in the LS-coupling scheme (energy splittings
not drawn to scale). First the electronic spin S (S = 1/2 in
this example) is coupled to the orbital angular momentum
L (here L = 0 in the ground state and L = 1 in the ex-
cited state) to produce the ﬁne structure angular momentum
J (here J = 1/2 and J
= 1/2 not shown). The
= 3/2; J
frequency of the ﬁne structure resonance line is ω0 (dashed
arrow). J is then coupled to the nuclear spin I to give the hy-
perﬁne angular momentum F . The allowed hyperﬁne dipole

(Fig. 1), where the total electronic angular momentum
J = L + S couples to the nuclear spin I, producing a
hyperﬁne multiplet F = J + I with F =
, ..., I + J.
|
The energy splitting of each hyperﬁne multiplet then is
much smaller than the ﬁne structure splitting. This is
the typical situation in alkali atoms like Rubidium: for
5P3/2) of the Rb85 isotope with nu-
the D2 line (5S1/2 →
clear spin I = 5/2, the ground-state J = 1/2 is split into
two levels with F = 2 and F = 3. Similarly, the excited
state J ′ = 3/2 is split into F ′ = 1, 2, 3, 4. Other coupling
cases could be easily treated along the lines of reasoning
described in the present paper. In general, several opti-
cal transitions F
1, F, F + 1 between the
ground-state and the excited state hyperﬁne multiplets
J ′ transition
are allowed. We will assume that the J
is closed so that, after having scattered an incoming pho-
ton, the atom returns to the same ground-state hyperﬁne
multiplet but possibly in a diﬀerent hyperﬁne level (this
is the case for the Rb D2 line).

Note that the frequency diﬀerence between the various
hyperﬁne transitions is completely negligible compared
to ω, and can be safely ignored for the evaluation of Γ
in the present context. Since the dipole operator D acts
only on the electronic angular momentum J, and not on
the nuclear spin I, the reduced matrix element can be
reduced even further [19]:

The 6j-symbol describes the recoupling of the 4 angular

sum over the ﬁnal hyperﬁne levels Ff in (5) then can be
done using a 6j-symbol normalization rule such that one
ﬁnds a uniform width for all excited hyperﬁne levels,

The prefactor contains the free photon spectral density

tion volume V .

C. Averaging over atomic degrees of freedom

Multiple scattering in the dilute regime can be depicted
as a succession of scattering events by single atoms con-
nected by propagation in an eﬀective medium. An eﬀec-
tive photon transport theory is obtained by a conﬁgura-
tion average over atomic degrees of freedom. The atoms
are assumed to be initially prepared independently in the
ground-state levels Fg with probabilities pg. These prob-
abilities can represent an equilibrium distribution at a
certain temperature or situations where hyperﬁne pump-
ing has been achieved.
Inside each level, we assume a
complete statistical distribution over magnetic quantum
numbers mg. Accordingly, the one-atom density matrix
of internal degrees of freedom reads

ˆρat =

pg ˆρ(0)
g

,

ˆρ(0)
g =

2Fg + 1

ˆPg .

(10)

The assumption of a scalar ˆρ(0)
is reasonable for opti-
g
cally thick samples, where the isotropization by multiply
scattered photons dominates possible optical pumping ef-
fects due to the incident laser. Needless to say, this as-
sumption greatly simpliﬁes the calculation. In essence,
an entirely analytical description is only manageable be-
cause the average over an isotropic distribution like (10)
restores rotational invariance.

D. Scattering mean free path and total
cross-section

The wave vector k of a photon with frequency ω in
the dilute atomic medium is determined by the disper-
sion relation k(ω) = ωnr(ω) where nr(ω) is the refractive

(6)

index. In scattering media, the refractive index has an
imaginary part that reﬂects the fact that scattering de-
pletes the propagating average photon ﬁeld. This deﬁnes
the scattering mean free path
k(ω) = 1/2ℓ(ω). Techni-
cally, the scattering mean free path is calculated via the
photon self-energy, which in turn is proportional to the
scattering operator (3) averaged over the atomic density
matrix (10) [14, 15]. Carrying out the isotropic sum over
mg, one ﬁnds

Here, n is the number density of atoms. The sum over
the ground-state levels g is due to the simple atomic dis-
tribution (10). The sum over the excited levels e is due
to the linear superposition of scattering amplitudes, and
the Lorentzian frequency dependence comes from taking
the imaginary part of the resonant denominators in (3).
The atomic level structure enters via the coeﬃcients Ceg,
a short-hand notation for the 6j-symbols

(13b)

Energy conservation dictates that extinction of the for-
ward propagating mode is related to the total scattering
cross-section σ(ω) by the relation ℓ(ω)−1 = nσ(ω). This
relation, the optical theorem in a multiple scattering dis-
guise, will be proved in the following subsection. We can
use it here to write the total scattering cross-section as

(14)

This total cross-section is a weighted sum of Lorentzians
of uniform width for all possible transitions (g
f ).
Since the total cross-section measures the total depletion
of the initial photon state, it includes both elastic scat-
tering events where the ﬁnal atomic level f is identical
to the initial level g, but also inelastic scattering where
the internal energy of the atom is changed. A separate
evaluation of elastic and inelastic scattering is possible
by considering the diﬀerential cross-section.

while the atom undergoes a transitions (g

frequency analysis are considered, it can be written in

Here, the total cross-section σ(ω) has been factorized
such that the dimensionless atomic vertex funtion
con-
tains all angular information about light polarization and
internal atomic structure. This vertex function has been
calculated in [14] for the case of a single isolated reso-
J ′ using the techniques of irreducible tensor
nance J
operators. Since we still assume a scalar density ma-
trix (10), the vertex function must still be the sum of all
possible scalar products of its vector arguments,

The coeﬃcients sgf
K (ω), together with the scattering
mean free path (11), are the basic ingredients for com-
puting multiple scattering quantities. The derivation of
expressions (18) to (20) constitutes the main achievement

of the present work. From this point on, we will essen-
tially explore its consequences.

The total cross-section (14) can be calculated from (15)
by a sum over all ﬁnal photon polarization vectors ˜ǫ and
an angular integration over the scattered photon’s direc-
tion ˜k/
. This operation on the vertex function (16)

(21)

which is equivalent to

(2K + 1)sK(ω) = 3 .

(22)

XK=0,1,2

This last relation can be deduced from (18) by virtue of
6j-symbol orthogonality [20] and the sum rule (13b). In a
more general setting, this relation is shown to be a trace-
conservation property of the intensity scattering vertex
[21]. With this, we indeed recover the total cross-section
(14) and thus prove the optical theorem ℓ(ω) = 1/nσ(ω)
that was used above to derive the total scattering cross-
section directly from the mean free path.

Note that the interference between scattering ampli-
tudes via diﬀerent excited states e, present in (18), disap-
pears in the total cross-section (14). This is a result of the
complete statistical average over the degenerate ground-
state. On the elementary level of Clebsch-Gordan coef-
ﬁcients, the somewhat abstract 6j-symbol orthogonality
appears as a complete cancellation of interference terms
from equiprobable ground-states for large detuning.

F. Elastic vs. inelastic scattering

cients permits to distinguish between elastic scattering
events with f = g and inelastic scattering events with

In principle, a frequency analysis of the scattered pho-

tic components from the various initial states g are at
the same frequency and cannot be distinguished by a
frequency analysis.

e = 3

Elastic scattering is of course desirable for coherent
multiple scattering since the scattered photons stay on
resonance. Therefore, previous experiments of coherent
backscattering from degenerate atomic dipole transitions
have been performed on various isolated hyperﬁne tran-
F ′ that are closed (see [22] for a compre-
sitions F
hensive list). Or rather, these transitions are very nearly
closed: a small rate of inelastic scattering persists be-
cause after excitation to an oﬀ-resonant hyperﬁne level
inelastic transitions are possible, for example the process
F ′
Ff = 2 is the case of the much-
Fg = 3
F ′ = 4 of Rb85. Detuning
studied transition F = 3
→
away from the closed resonance towards the other reso-
nances of course increases the inelastic scattering rate. A
completely consistent theory of scattering from hyperﬁne
multiplets therefore needs to take into account inelastic
scattering. This can be done in a Monte Carlo simula-
tion of photon trajectories but is beyond the scope of
the present article, devoted to analytical results. In sec-
tion IV, we will therefore specialize to the interesting
case where hyperﬁne multiplets are simultaneously ex-
cited from a unique ground-state which assures purely
elastic scattering.

III. TRANSITION TO CLASSICAL
SCATTERING PROPERTIES

For an isotropic atomic transition F = 0

F ′ = 1,
there is only a single non-degenerate ground-state and a
single three-fold degenerate excited state. In such a case,
the weights coeﬃcients in (16) are simply w1 = 1, w2 =
w3 = 0, and the atom scatters light like a classical point-
dipole or Rayleigh scatterer with

(28)

This is equivalent to the quasi-classical model of an elas-
tically bound electron.
In this case interference eﬀects
in multiple scattering are fully preserved and the CBS
enhancement factor achieves its maximal value 2 in the
helicity-preserving channel [12]. In optics, scattering of
light – including interference eﬀects like CBS – by small
particles (smaller than the wavelength of light) is often

6
successfully described by modelling the small particles
as classical point-dipole scatterers. However, such clas-
sical particles are very unlikely to be in a pure F = 0
state, and we know that atoms in F > 0 states show
very low CBS interference in all polarization channels
[10, 13]. Therefore, the validity of the classical point-
scatterer model for complex objects with possibly many
internal resonances is rather surprising. In this section,
we therefore show how “classical” scattering properties
are recovered for complex quantum objects (like atoms,
molecules or clusters). In other words, we close the gap
between the microscopic theory for atoms and eﬀective
models for classical scatterers.

A. Time scales

A non-trivial point is to understand why the hyperﬁne
structure aﬀects the light scattering properties at all, al-
though the nuclear spin is optically completely inactive.
Since F is a good quantum number, the semiclassical pic-
ture of hyperﬁne structure is that both the nuclear spin I
and the electronic angular momentum J precess around
their constant sum F = I + J. It follows that the atomic
electric dipole precesses after being excited by the incom-
ing laser ﬁeld. If the laser source is very monochromatic –
linewidth smaller than the classical precession frequency,
i.e., temporal coherence longer than the precession period
– the radiated ﬁeld is built by a coherent superposition of
radiating dipoles with various spatial orientations. The
net result of this coherent superposition, calculated us-
ing quantum theory of angular momenta, is the unusual
radiation pattern (16). There are, however, two com-
plications: ﬁrstly, the atomic dipole decays because of
spontaneous emission over the time Γ−1; secondly, if the
excitation is not exactly resonant, it also oscillates at a
frequency equal to the detuning δ from resonance.

These two eﬀects are properly understood by consider-
ing the scattering of a quasimonochromatic wave-packet
formed by superposition of diﬀerent neighboring frequen-
cies around a central frequency ω. Such a wavepacket
is not scattered instantaneously, but after some delay
tW(ω), known as the Wigner time delay. It is given by
the derivative of the scattering phase shift arctan(2δ/Γ)
– see (9) – with respect to frequency:

tW(ω) =

2
Γ

1
1 + 4δ2/Γ2 .

(29)

The Wigner time delay is the time scale after which the
atomic dipole induced by the incoming electromagnetic
ﬁeld ceases to radiate coherently. It is maximum at reso-
nance where it is twice the lifetime of the atomic excited
state, and decays towards zero away from resonance.

If the Wigner time delay tW(ω) is longer than the pe-
riod of hyperﬁne precession T∆ = 2π/∆, where ∆ is the
typical hyperﬁne splitting, then the radiating dipole pre-
cesses during its coherence time, thus giving rise to a
speciﬁc radiation pattern. This is the case at resonance

6

if the linewidth Γ is smaller than the hyperﬁne splitting
∆, a situation usually encountered for an isolated hyper-
ﬁne component. By contrast, if the Wigner time delay
tW(ω) is shorter than the period of hyperﬁne precession
T∆, then one expects the radiating dipole to be spatially
frozen during its coherence time. Consequently, the ra-
diation pattern should turn into the one associated with
a classical dipole.

≫

There are two obvious ways of reaching the classical
scattering situation tW(ω)
T∆. Either the sponta-
≪
neous decay rate is larger than the hyperﬁne splitting,
∆, such that the various components of the hyper-
Γ
ﬁne multiplet are not resolved anyway. Or the resonances
are well separated, Γ
∆, and one uses a suﬃciently
large detuning to bring the Wigner time delay below the
hyperﬁne precession period. By detuning far away from
the entire multiplet of hyperﬁne resonances, the excita-
tion then no longer probes the nuclear spin, and therefore
scattering is only sensitive to the ﬁne structure.

≪

B. Analytical derivation

The full analytical theory developed in section II per-
mits to follow precisely how the diﬀerent resonance con-
tributions combine to yield classical scattering character-
istics for large detuning. When the Wigner time delay is
shorter than the hyperﬁne period, all resonant denomi-
nators (δeg +i Γ/2) can be taken equal to a common value
ω0 is now the detuning from
(δ + i Γ/2), where δ = ω
J ′ (cf. Fig. 1). In
the ﬁne-structure resonance line J
expression (14), the resonant denominator can thus be
factorized from the sum over excited states e. The sum
rule (13a) together with the normalization
g pg = 1
can then be used to obtain the eﬀective ﬁne-structure
cross-section

(31)

is the ratio of multiplicities normalized to M01 = 1. The
cross-section is now independent of the hyperﬁne struc-
ture, i.e., no longer depends on the nuclear spin I and the
population pg of the various hyperﬁne levels. Similar ar-
guments apply to the scattering of broadband radiation
by thermal atoms (see especially section 3.4.2. of [16]).

The radiation pattern of the scattered photons is
subject to the same transformation:
the frequency-
dependent denominator can be factorized from the sum
over e in (18). For large enough detuning, the atomic
medium makes no diﬀerence between photons scattered
elastically or inelastically, such that all contributions of
ﬁnal states f must be added. The resulting sum involves

the product of three 6j coeﬃcients which can be com-
puted using the Biedenharn-Elliott sum rule [20] and ev-
erything boils down to the coeﬃcients calculated in [14]:

sK = 3(2J ′ + 1)

1 1 K
J J J ′ (cid:27)

(cid:26)

.

(32)

The diﬀerential cross-section then is still given by (15),
its only frequency dependence being the single Lorentzian
resonance of the total cross-section (30).

The very same arguments apply to the electron spin
responsible for the atomic ﬁne structure.
Indeed, the
coupling of the electronic orbital angular momentum L
with the optically inactive electronic spin S produces the
total electronic angular momentum J = L + S. Again,
when the spontaneous decay rate Γ is larger than the ﬁne-
structure splitting (meaning that the various components
of the ﬁne-structure multiplet are not resolved), or when
the laser frequency is far-detuned from the ﬁne-structure
multiplet such that one has to sum over all possible ex-
cited levels J ′, one recovers the case of a L
L′ tran-
sition, where only the orbital properties (directly related
to the charge density response to the laser excitation)
of the electrons play a role. The formulas are simply ob-
tained from eqs. (30), (31), and (32) through replacement
of (J, J ′) by (L, L′).

→

If the ground-state of an atom is an S state with L = 0,
which can be optically excited only to a P state with
L′ = 1, we ﬁnd MLL′ = 1 and the sK coeﬃcients (32)
simply reduce to s0 = 3, s1 = s2 = 0. We are back to
the situation (28) where the atom radiates exactly like a
classical point-dipole scatterer since only a single atomic
transition 0

1 is optically active.

→

C. Molecules and complex objects

The previous analysis can be extended to objects
slightly more complex than atoms, but whose energy
spectrum and eigenstates can still be calculated. Let
us for example consider a diatomic molecule with ro-
vibrational structure. If the molecular linewidths are suf-
ﬁciently small for the rotational structure to be resolved,
and if the incoming light is suﬃciently monochromatic for
a single rotational line to be resonant, then the molecule
will scatter light with the speciﬁc radiation pattern of the
J ′ transition. This is because the Wigner
resonant J
time delay is longer than the rotational period of the
molecule. In contrast, if several J
1 ro-
tational transitions have to be taken into account coher-
ently, a sum over excited states has to be performed, very
similar to the one in (3), with the only diﬀerence that
the dipole matrix elements depend now on the molecu-
lar quantum numbers, instead of J and F. These dipole
elements are given in [25] for various possible couplings.
A full discussion is beyond the scope of this paper, but
the net result is as expected: the sum simpliﬁes thanks
to sum rules over 3j and 6j symbols and the radiation

J ′ = J, J

→

pattern depends only on the electronic dipole transition
considered. In the most common case where it is a Σ
Π
P
transition (the molecular equivalent of an atomic S
transition), one recovers again as a net result the fact
that the molecule scatters light like a Rayleigh scatterer.
The case of objects with more complicated internal
structure can be analyzed along the same lines. When-
ever the internal evolution time is longer than the Wigner
time delay, one expects the internal structure to be frozen
and irrelevant for light scattering properties. When the
size of the object increases, the density of states rapidly
increases and the quantum coherences decay faster, mak-
ing the Wigner time delay shorter. At the same time, the
internal time scale for rotation increases following the
larger moment of intertia. Observing an unusual radia-
tion pattern would require to selectively excite a single
resonant optical transition between two precise quantum
eigenstates. For objects with more than a few atoms,
this is highly improbable. Generically, quantum interfer-
ence is washed out, and the object scatters “classically”,
i.e., following the average electronic polarizability [26].
For an object with rotational invariance, this implies an
isotropic polarizability tensor and the radiation pattern
will be identical to the one of a point dipole scatterer
(28). For more general situations where the scatterers are
anisotropic and possibly oriented – for example nematic
liquid crystals in external ﬁelds – the scattering proper-
ties remain anisotropic and are described by a classical
anisotropic polarizability tensor [27].

IV. ELASTIC SCATTERING

The general expressions of section II simplify consider-
ably in the case of a unique ground-state since only elastic
scattering can occur. This is the case when there is no
hyperﬁne splitting (because either I = 0 or J = 0), or
when a closed dipole transition far from other resonances
is probed (cf. Fig. 2). In such cases, the 6j coeﬃcients
(12) obey certain selection rules and are most easily cal-
culated using the sum rule eq. (13b) that reduces to a
single term for the only ground level Fg:

C2

eg =

1
(2J ′ + 1) (2Fg + 1)

,

(33)

an expression which is notably independent of the excited
state(s) e. In the following, we distinguish between cases
where a single excited state is relevant (and we are back
to the previous results [14]) and the new situation where
several excited states have to be considered.

A. Unique excited state

In the two situations shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b,
there is only a single eﬀective two-level system to be con-
sidered. In these two cases, sums over ground and excited

B. Multiple excited states

A more interesting situation occurs when there is a
unique ground-state coupled to a multiplet of excited
states, e.g., for a vanishing electronic ground-state an-

Expression (38) shows clearly that the coherent super-
positon of amplitudes (3) carries through to the aver-
age intensity: the coeﬃcients sK are squares of interfer-
ing amplitudes and not the sum of squared amplitudes.
Therefore, the inﬂuence of other resonances may lead to
subtle phenomena in multiple scattering, sensitive to the
diﬀerential cross-section, which are not immediately vis-
ible in the total scattering cross-section (37).
Indeed,
by virtue of a 6j-symbol orthogonality, the total cross-
section is just the “incoherent” sum of the individual
cross-sections and therefore insensitive to these interfer-
ence eﬀects. In the classical picture, this can be nicely
understood: the three hyperﬁne matrix elements actu-
ally originate from the same optically active transition
J ′ = 1, and the precession of J around the
J = 0
nuclear spin I modiﬁes only its spatial repartition, not
the total scattering rate.

→

In [14], elastic coherent backscattering of light by
atoms has been calculated analytically in the double scat-
tering approximation and for a semi-inﬁnite scattering
medium, at ﬁxed detuning from an isolated resonance
J ′. Now, all results of [14] can be extended to
J
arbitrary values of light frequency. Similarly, using the
Monte-Carlo method described in [28], the full CBS cone
(with arbitrarily large scattering orders) can be com-
puted numerically.

→

As a speciﬁc example, we will consider the case of
the fermionic isotope Sr87 of Strontium where the energy
splitting between hyperﬁne components is comparable to
the widths of the resonances themselves [29]. Fig. 3(a)
1P1
shows the total scattering cross-section for the 1S0 →
optical transition (Γ/2π = 32 MHz) with Fg = I = 9/2

C. Single backscattering from a semi-inﬁnite
medium

The amount of light reﬂected oﬀ the sample after N
scattering events can be quantiﬁed by a dimensionless
parameter called the bistatic coeﬃcient γN . The sin-
gle scattering bistatic coeﬃcient γ1 in the backward di-
rection for a semi-inﬁnite medium with constant spatial
density exposed to an incoming plane wave at normal in-
cidence is essentially the atomic polarization vertex (16)
(see eq. (42) of [14], namely

In Fig. 3(b), γ1 is plotted as function of the detuning
9/2 by using the frequency-
from the transition 9/2
dependent weights wi(ω) given by (17) in terms of (38).
The four curves correspond to the usual polarization
h (parallel helicities, i.e., opposite circular
channels: h
h (orthog-
polarizations in the backward direction), h
onal helicities), l
l (parallel linear polarizations), and
l
l (orthogonal linear polarizations). Since we take a
⊥
semi-inﬁnite medium, every photon entering the medium
must eventually exit. The atomic internal structure only
redistributes photons into diﬀerent polarisation chan-
nels. The total intensity is independent of frequency,

Far from resonance, the atom radiates like a point-
dipole scatterer, in agreement with the general discussion

since the radiated polarization is equal to the incoming
one, the bistatic coeﬃcient vanishes in the l

channels and takes its maximal value 3/4 in the l

complex. Anisotropic scattering populates all polariza-
tion channels and interference eﬀects between the various
hyperﬁne components are clearly made visible by the po-
larization analysis.

D. Double scattering interference contrast

The multiply scattered intensity (N > 1) contains
two dominant contributions: ﬁrst, the so-called ladder
contribution γ(L)
N without interference between multi-
ple scattering amplitudes. This corresponds to waves
co-propagating along scattering paths. Second, the so-
called maximally crossed contribution γ(C)
N which origi-
nates from counter-propagating waves and incorporates

2

2

and γ(C)

the interference responsible for the CBS peak. The CBS
interference contrast at scattering order N is the ratio
N /γ(L)
γ(C)
N . For double scattering, N = 2, the formulas
(B6) and (B24) of [14] directly give γ(L)
at exact
backscattering in terms of the weights (w1, w2, w3). In
2 /γ(L)
Fig. 3(c), the double scattering CBS contrast γ(C)
is plotted as function of detuning. The on-resonant pre-
dictions for well separated resonances, shown as symbols,
neglect the interference between the diﬀerent resonances
and are clearly not suited for quantitative predictions.
Outside the multiplet, the double scattering CBS inter-
ference contrast approaches the maximum value 1 pre-
dicted for the isotropic dipole or non-degenerate transi-
J ′ = 1 in all channels (beyond double
tion J = 0
scattering, the contrast is unity only in the parallel chan-
nels h
l), again in agreement with the general
h and l
discussion in section III.

Considering only the resonance with highest frequency,
here 9/2
7/2, it is evident that the interference con-
trast is generically larger towards the blue side in order
to reach the optimal value 1 at large detuning. Further-
more, the largest asymmetry or slope on resonance is
found for the h
h channel since it starts from the low-
est contrast on resonance. These features, present in the
ﬁgures of [11] but unexplained by the authors, therefore
ﬁnd a natural explanation.

weights wi(ω) can be used for evaluating the multiply
scattered intensity via the propagation eigenvalues of the
ladder and crossed series, λ(ω) and χ(ω), as derived in
[15]. For third order scattering and beyond, exact an-
alytic calculations become very complicated, and it is
more convenient to turn to a Monte-Carlo approach, as
described in [28]. In Fig. 3(d), we plot the CBS enhance-
ment factor for Sr87 as a function of detuning, in the four
polarization channels and for a semi-inﬁnite medium.
The most obvious observation is that the enhancement
factors are typically small in the region of overlapping
atomic transitions, and take larger values at large de-
tuning, as expected from the transition to classical scat-
tering behavior discussed in section III. High orders of
scattering contribute signiﬁcantly to the ladder intensity,
but only weakly to the CBS contribution because phase
coherence is rapidly lost after the average over atomic de-
grees of freedom. The enhancement factor thus behaves
similarly to the double scattering contrast, only amplify-
ing the changes with the detuning.

A strong reduction of the CBS enhancement factor in
the vicinity of a particular resonance may have various

origins. For example, in the h
h channel, for negative
detuning, the double scattering contrast is rather high.
This is because the dominant contribution comes from
the 9/2
J type with large
J (see [14]). The reduction of the enhancement factor
here must be attributed to single scattering. For posi-
tive detuning, the situation is opposite: single scattering
is rather low, but also the double scattering contrast is
poor.

Note, however, that this limit is reached very slowly:
the enhancement hardly exceeds 1.5 in the h
h channel
for the largest detuning in Fig. 3, although it is twice
as large as the total splitting ∆ of the hyperﬁne multi-
plet. The reason for the slow recovery is simple to under-
stand: for a semi-inﬁnite medium, long scattering paths
contribute signiﬁcantly to the CBS cone, with all paths
beyond order N giving an integrated contribution scaling
like N −1/2. At large detuning, the wi coeﬃcients tend to
their limiting values like δ/∆. This in turns implies that
δ/∆ of the perfect contrast is lost at each
a fraction
∆/δ on
scattering event, putting an eﬀective cutoﬀ
the scattering orders contributing to the CBS cone. Al-
together, this implies that the asymptotic value 2 for the
enhancement factor is reached only like
δ/∆. In other
words, even a small unresolved hyperﬁne structure may
signiﬁcantly reduce the interference contrast. This is a
clear illustration that CBS – and any quantum interfer-
ence for that matter – is very sensitive to small couplings
to uncontrolled degrees of freedom.

V. CONCLUSION

In the present paper, we have considered multiple scat-
tering of photons by a disordered medium of atom at rest
with several internal resonances. We have developed the
analytical calculation of the total photon scattering cross-
section σ(ω) and the diﬀerential cross-section (dσ/dΩ)
as a function of the light frequency and of the relevant
angular momentum parameters deﬁning the internal res-
onances. We have examined under which conditions the
various resonances conspire to yield the classical model
of an isotropic dipole. As an application of the theory to
multiple elastic scattering from hyperﬁne multiplets, we
have calculated the CBS enhancement for a hypothetic
half-space with a homogeneous average density of atoms.

The present paper makes two major restrictive as-
sumptions that should be lifted in subsequent investi-
gations. First, the results presented in section IV for
the CBS enhancement factors have been calculated for
the case of a closed transition with a unique ground-
state assuring purely elastic scattering. The more general
case of inelastic scattering from open transitions can be
treated along the same lines by using the analytical the-
ory developed in section II. Second, real experiments
with cold atoms are not performed on semi-inﬁnite ho-
mogeneous media, but on inhomogeneous clouds of ﬁnite
optical thickness. Their mean free path and thus the
optical thickness change drastically under detuning from
resonance. This in turn modiﬁes the relative weight of
diﬀerent scattering orders and therefore also the enhance-
ment factor. Consequently, for scattering media of ﬁnite
extent, these purely geometrical eﬀects must be taken
into account. An eﬃcient numerical Monte-Carlo method
for this situation has been presented in [28]. The above

analytical expressions for the mean free path and the
intensity vertex coeﬃcients can be introduced into this
program and permit to obtain accurate CBS enhance-
ment factors and full peak shapes for quantitative com-
parison with experiments. However, both questions are
beyond the scope of the present contribution and will be
discussed elsewhere.

Abstract

The ground state hyperﬁne splitting values and the transition
probabilities between the hyperﬁne structure components of high Z
lithiumlike ions are calculated in the range Z = 49 − 83. The rela-
tivistic, nuclear, QED and interelectronic interaction corrections are
taken into account. It is found that the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect can be
eliminated in a combination of the hyperﬁne splitting values of the
hydrogenlike and lithiumlike ions of an isotope. This gives a good
possibility for testing the QED eﬀects in a combination of the strong
electric and magnetic ﬁelds of the heavy nucleus. Using the experimen-
tal result for the 1s hyperﬁne splitting in 209Bi82+ , the 2s hyperﬁne
splitting in 209Bi80+ is calculated to be ∆E = 0.7981(2) eV while the
contribution derived from QED constitutes 0.0007(1) eV.

1 Introduction

Recently, laser spectroscopic measurements of the ground state hyperﬁne
splitting in high Z hydrogenlike ions became possible at ESR [1] and at the
Super-EBIT [2]. The present status of theory of the hyperﬁne splitting in high
Z hydrogenlike ions is discussed in [3]. One of possible directions of further
experiments is an extension of the investigations to high Z lithiumlike ions.
Recently the hyperﬁne structure values of lithiumlike ions were calculated
in the range Z = 7 − 30 [4] in connection with astrophysical search and for
209Bi80+ (without the QED correction) [5] in connection with experiments at
GSI [1]. In Sec. 2 of the present paper we reﬁne the calculation of [5] for
209Bi80+, considering a more accurate treatment of the nuclear eﬀects and
taking into account the QED corrections, and extend it to lithiumlike ions in
the range Z = 49 − 83, which are likely candidates for the experiments. In
addition, a method based on using the experimental values of the 1s hyperﬁne
splitting for determination of the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect in the lithiumlike ions
is proposed. This method is used to reduce the uncertainty of the ground
state hyperﬁne splitting in 209Bi80+ and 165Ho64+. It gives a good possibility
for testing the magnetic sector of QED. In Sec. 3 the transition probabilities
between the hyperﬁne structure components are calculated.

The one-electron contribution is enclosed in the square brackets of the equa-
tion (1). We denote it by a2s:

To calculate the nuclear charge distribution correction δ we used the two-
parameter Fermi model with the parameters taken from [6].

In the case of
Neglecting these terms gives the equations derived in [7].
the single particle nuclear model the equations (4)-(8) were used in [3] for
calculations of the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect for the 1s state. We extended these
calculations to the 2s state. The uncertainty due to deviation from the
single particle nuclear model was estimated in the same way as in [3]. This
uncertainty gives a dominant contribution to the error bars of the hyperﬁne
splitting values. So, more accurate calculations of the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect
including a consequent procedure for determination of the uncertainty are
necessary. Such calcualations, based on a dynamic-correlation model [8,9],
are underway and will be published elsewhere. However, the uncertainty
of the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect can be considerably reduced if the 1s hyperﬁne
splitting value is known from experiment with suﬃcient precision. To explain
this point, let us consider the equations (4)-(8). As one can see from these
equations, the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect depends of the electronic structure only
through the functions KS(r) and KL(r). Simple approximate expressions for
these functions were derived in [10]. As it follows from these expressions and
is conﬁrmed by more accurate calculations, with high precision (∼ 0.1% for
Z=83) the functions KS(r) and KL(r) for the 2s state are diﬀerent from those
for the 1s state only by an overall factor denoted in [10] by b. (This fact can
easily be understood if we take into account that the binding energy of the
electron (W = E − mc2) is small in comparison with the nuclear potential
(V (r)) in the nuclear region. So, the binding energy gives only a small
correction to behaviour of the functions g(r) and f (r) within the nucleus.)
It follows that the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect for the 2s state can be found by
using ε for the 1s state and the values of the overall factors tabulated in [10]
(while the relative precision of b in [10] is of order αZR/(¯h/mc), where R
is the nuclear radius, the precision of the ratio b(2s)/b(1s) is higher by orders
of magnitude). If the 1s hyperﬁne splitting is known from experiment, the

High precision experimental values of the 1s hyperﬁne splitting were found
for 209Bi82+ (λ = 243.87(4) nm) [1] and for 165Ho66+ (λ = 572.79(15) nm) [2].
Using these experimental values and the related theoretical values from [3]
(with µ = 4.1106(2)µN for 209Bi [11] and µ = 4.132(5)µN for 165Ho [12,13,2]),
the equations (9)-(10) give ε(1s) = 0.0152(2), ε(2s) = 0.0164(3) for 209Bi82+
and ε(1s) = 0.0095(13), ε(2s) = 0.0101(14) for 165Ho66+. For comparison, the
direct calculation, based on the single particle nuclear model, gives ε(1s) =
0.0118(49), ε(2s) = 0.0127(53) for 209Bi82+ and ε(1s) = 0.0089(27), ε(2s) =
0.0094(28) for 165Ho66+.

2.1.2 QED corrections

The radiative correction is the sum of the vacuum polarization (VP) and
self energy (SE) contributions. The VP contribution is largely made up of
the Uehling term. Calculation of this term was done in the same way as for
the 1s state [3,14]. As to the Wichman-Kroll term, we calculated only the
electric loop correction to the electron wave function expecting that, like the
VP screening contribution for two-electron ions [15], the magnetic loop term
is too small.

To calculate the SE contribution we used a covariant way based on ex-
pansion of the electron propagator in terms of external ﬁeld [16,17]. The
formal expression for this contribution can easily be derived using the Green
function method (see, e.g., [5]). The contribution of the diagram with the hy-
perﬁne interaction outside the self-energy loop is divided into irreducible and

5

reducible parts. The reducible part is the part in which the intermediate-
state energy (between the self-energy loop and the hyperﬁne interaction)
coincides with the initial-state energy. The irreducible part is the remaining
one. The irreducible part is calculated in the same way as the ﬁrst order
self-energy contribution. The reducible part is grouped with the vertex dia-
gram. According to the Ward identity the counterterms for the vertex and
the reducible parts cancel each other and, so, the sum of these terms regular-
ized in the same covariant way is ultraviolet ﬁnite. To cancel the ultraviolet
divergences we separate free propagators from the bound electron lines and
calculate them in the momentum representation. The remainder is ultravi-
olet ﬁnite but contains infrared divergences, which are explicitly separated
and cancelled. The results of our calculation for a ﬁnite nuclear charge dis-
tribution for the 1s and 2s states, expressed in terms of the function F (αZ)
deﬁned by

∆ESE =

F (αZ)∆ENS ,

are given in the table 1. A more detailed analysis of the calculation is given
in Ref.
In the
[18], which contains also the results for a point nucleus.
case of the 1s state the calculation of the SE contribution to the hyperﬁne
splitting for a ﬁnite nuclear charge distribution was done ﬁrst in [17,19] in
a wide interval of Z.
In the case of Z = 83 and a point nucleus such a
calculation was done in [20] where it was found xSE = −3.8α. The present
calculation for Z = 83 and a point nucleus gives xSE = −3.94α (in the case
of an extended nucleus, xSE = −3.09α). The discrepancy of the present
result with the one of Ref. [20] is caused by a spurious term which appears
in the non-covariant regularization procedure used in [20]. A comparison of
the present calculation for an extended nucleus with Refs. [17,19] ﬁnds some
discrepancy too. So, for Z = 83 our result is F = −5.14(1) while in [17,19]
it was obtained F = −5.098. This discrepancy results from a small term in
the vertex contribution omitted in [17,19]. For the 1s state our results are in
good agreement with a recent calculation of Ref. [21] where for Z = 83 it is
found F = −5.1432.

In addition to the nuclear charge distribution correction, there is also a
nuclear magnetization distribution correction to the QED eﬀect (a combined
QED - Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect). This correction is expected to be negligible
compared with the uncertainty of the ﬁrst order Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect.

6

Comparing the VP and SE contributions for the 1s and 2s states we found

that, within a few percent, they are related by

x(2s)
VP,SE
A(2s) ≈

x(1s)
VP,SE
A(1s)

.

(12)

This means that, like the nuclear corrections (δ and ε) [10], a dominant
contribution to the QED corrections to the hyperﬁne splitting arises from
distances where the binding energy of the electron is small compared with
the nuclear potential.

The values of the one-electron corrections to the 2s hyperﬁne splitting,
with the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect calculated within the single particle nuclear
model, are listed in the table 2.

2.2

Interelectronic interaction corrections

To ﬁnd the function B(αZ) we have to calculate the Feynman diagrams
containing, in addition to the hyperﬁne interaction line, a photon line cor-
responding to the interelectronic interaction. Such a calculation for a point
nucleus with an approximate evaluation of the ﬁnite nuclear size eﬀect was
done in [5]. In the present paper we calculate this function with accurate
treatment of the nuclear charge distribution eﬀect. For that the formulas
from [5] and the ﬁnite basis set method for the Dirac equation [22-24] are
used. Like the one-electron contribution, it is convenient to represent the
function B(αZ) in the form

B(αZ) = B0(αZ)(1 − δB)(1 − εB) ,

(13)

where B0(αZ) is the point nucleus approximation of B(αZ), δB is the nu-
clear charge distribution correction to this function, and εB is the nuclear
magnetization distribution correction. The values B0 and δB are given in the
second and third columns of the table 3. As one can see from the tables 2 and
3, in agreement with an approximate evaluation of the nuclear size eﬀect for
B(αZ) given in [5], the values δB are very close to the related one-electron
values δ. It is natural to assume that the nuclear magnetization correction
εB is also close to the related one-electron value ε (this assumption can be
argued in the same way as the corresponding assumption for δ in [5]). So,

7

in the last column of the table 3 we give the values B(αZ) corrected by the
factor (1 − ε).

The term C(αZ)/Z 2 in equation (1) is small enough and was estimated

in the non-relativistic approximation:

C(αZ)

Z 2 ≈

C(0)
Z 2

(14)

The coeﬃcient C(0) was found from the CI-HF calculation of [4] to be C(0) =
0.87 ± 0.05.

2.3 Complete theoretical values

In the table 4 we give the theoretical values of the energies and wavelengths
of the transition between the ground state hyperﬁne splitting components of
high Z lithiumlike ions, based on using the single particle nuclear model in
the calculation of the Bohr-Wesskopf eﬀect. The error bars given in the table
are mainly deﬁned by the uncertainty of the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect discussed
in [3]. As is known (see tables 1 and 2 in [10]), the nuclear corrections ε and
δ are weekly dependent functions of the the principal quantum number n for
the s states and, so, cancel considerably in the the ratio of the 2s and 1s
hyperﬁne splitting values. It means that, if the value ε is calculated in the
same nuclear model for the 1s and 2s states, the ratio has a higher precision
than the individual hyperﬁne splitting values. In this connection in the last
column of the table 4 we give the values η deﬁned by

η =

8∆E(1s)22s
∆E1s

=

A(2s)(1 − δ(2s))(1 − ε(2s)) + x(2s)

rad + B(αZ)
A(1s)(1 − δ(1s))(1 − ε(1s)) + x(1s)
rad

Z + C(0)

Z 2

.

(15)

These values can be useful for comparison experimental values of the hyper-
ﬁne splitting in the hydrogenlike and lithiumlike ions of an isotope. According
to the equation (12) the one-electron QED corrections are also considerably
cancelled in the ratio (15) and, so, the value η is mainly deﬁned by the
functions A(αZ) and B(αZ).

More accurate calculations can be done for 209Bi80+ and 165Ho64+ by using
the values of the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect found above from the 1s hyperﬁne
splitting experiments. In addition, a combined interelectronic interaction -

8

QED correction can roughly be estimated assuming

∆E(2s)

int,QED ∼

B(αZ)
Z

∆E(2s)
QED
A(αZ)

.

(16)

This formula can be understood if we take into account that the interelec-
tronic interaction correction is mainly deﬁned by the direct Coulomb in-
teraction of the 2s electron with the closed 1s shell [5]. Since a dominant
contribution to the QED correction arises from distances where the Coulomb
potential of the nucleus is to be alone (see the text after the equation (12)),
the interaction of the 2s electron with the spherically symmetric potential
of the closed 1s shell almost does not change the relative value of the QED
correction (it changes mainly the normalization factor of the wave function
for small distances). The precision of the estimate (16) is taken to be 50%.
Combining these corrections with the other contributions from the tables
2-4 gives ∆E = 0.7981(2) eV (λ = 1.5535(3)µm) for 209Bi80+ and ∆E =
0.3054(1) eV (λ = 4.060(1) µm) for 165Ho64+. The values of the individual
contributions are given in the table 5. It should be stressed here that the
uncertainty of the total hyperﬁne splitting values is not equal to the sum of
the uncertainties of the individual contributions given in the table 5. It is
caused by the fact that the total hyperﬁne splitting value found in this way
is stable enough in respect to possible changes of the nuclear charge radius
and the magnetic moment. For explanation, let us represent the 2s hyperﬁne
splitting value in the form

∆E(2s) = ∆E(2s)

Because the factor (1 − b(2s)
b(1s) ) is small (it constitutes -0.078 for Z=83) the
ratio δ(∆E(2s))/∆E(2s) is smaller, at least, by orders of magnitude than δµ/µ.
Considering in the same way a small variation of the nuclear charge radius
and taking into account that δ(1s), δ(2s), and δB are considerably cancelled
in the equation (18) (e.g., in the case Z = 83, (δ(2s) − δ(1s))/(δ(1s))=0.063
and (δB − δ(1s))/(δ(1s))=0.16) we get a similar result. As to a small variation
of the 1s experimental hyperﬁne splitting value, we ﬁnd δ(∆E(2s))/∆E(2s)=
δ(∆E(1s)
exp . So, the uncertainty of the total hyperﬁne splitting value
is mainly deﬁned by δ(∆E1s
exp) and the combined interelectronic interaction
-QED term estimated by (16).

2.4 Testing QED eﬀects

One of the main objects of the investigations of the hyperﬁne splitting of
highly charged ions consists in testing QED eﬀects in the strong electric and
magnetic ﬁelds of heavy nuclei. As one can see from the table 5, the QED
contributions for the 2s state are larger than the uncertainties of the hyperﬁne
splitting values with the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect found from the 1s hyperﬁne
splitting. However, since the calculation of the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect includes
the QED correction of the 1s state, it is natural to consider as a value derived
from QED the sum of the last three terms in the equation (17). (Strictly
speaking, division of the contributions into QED and non-QED parts is not
uniquely deﬁned. So, a part of the interelectronic interaction contribution
(the function B(αZ)) can be considered as a two-electron QED eﬀect [5]).
We ﬁnd that the value derived from QED is 0.0007(1) eV for 209Bi80+ and
0.0002 eV for 165Ho64+. Comparing these values with the uncertainty of the
hyperﬁne splitting given above (see also the table 5) shows that measurement
of the ground state hyperﬁne splitting in lithiumlike bismuth would give a
good possibility for testing QED eﬀects in a combination of the strong electric
and magnetic ﬁelds.

3 Transition probabilities

As is well known [25-27], the transition between the hyperﬁne splitting com-
ponents of an atomic level is a M1 transition. In the hydrogenlike approx-
imation, which corresponds to the zeroth order in 1/Z, in the case of one
electron over a closed shell the transition probability is given by the formula

wF →F ′ = α

Because the integrand in (20) is strongly decreasing function of r at r → 0,
the ﬁnite nuclear size corrections to (21), (22) can be neglected. To calculate
the 1/Z interelectronic interaction correction to the transition probability
we used the technique developed in [29,5]. We found that this correction is
small enough. So, it increases w by 0.23% for 209Bi80+ and by 0.17% for
165Ho64+. We note also that a calculation of the transition probability for a
many electron atom, including an approximate treatment of the 1/Z term,
can be done by the formula

Such a calculation, based on the CI-HF method [4], conﬁrms the exact (in

The results of the calculation of the transition probabilities and the life-
times (τ = 1/w), based on using the transition energies from the table 4,
are presented in the table 6. According to the equations (20)-(22) the uncer-
tainty of the transition probability is three times larger than the uncertainty
of the transition energy.

More accurate calculation of the transition probability for 209Bi80+ and
165Ho64+, based on the transition energies from the table 5, gives w = 12.09(2)
s−1 (τ = 0.0827(1) s) for 209Bi80+ and w = 0.676(1) s−1 (τ = 1.479(2) s) for
165Ho64+. The errors bars are chosen to include the uncalculated terms.

Conclusion

In the present paper we calculated the ground state hyperﬁne splitting values
and the transition probabilities between the hyperﬁne structure components
of high Z lithiumlike ions. We proposed a method which allows one to elimi-
nate completely the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect in a combination of the hyperﬁne
splitting values of the 1s and 2s states and, so, gives a good possibility for
testing the QED eﬀects. So, according to our calculations a measurement
of the ground state hyperﬁne splitting values in 209Bi82+ and 209Bi80+ with
accuracy 10−4 would allow one to test the QED eﬀects with accuracy 15%.
Recently [30], the ﬁrst experimental result for the ground state hyperﬁne
splitting in lithiumlike bismuth was reported to be ∆Eexp = 0.803(31)eV.
This value is in good agreement with the theoretical value found within
the single particle nuclear model (∆E = 0.801(4)eV) as well as with the
value obtained by using the experimental result for the 1s hyperﬁne splitting
(∆E = 0.7981(2)eV).

We analyze the formation of Rb2 molecules with short photoassociation pulses applied to a cold
85Rb sample. The laser ﬁeld couples a continuum level of the ground electronic state X1Σ+
g with
bound levels in the 0+
u (5S+5P3/2) vibrational series. The non-adiabatic coupling
between the two excited channels induces time-dependent beatings in the populations. We propose to
take advantage of these oscillations either to probe the photoassociation process via a photoionization
pulse, or to optimize the stabilization step into deep levels of the ground state.

Making ultracold molecules in the v=0 level of the
ground electronic state is presently an important chal-
lenge since it opens the road toward coherent ultracold
chemistry [1, 2]. Schemes based on photoassociation
of ultracold atoms [3] with cw lasers, followed by ra-
diative stabilization, have been very successful to form
molecules in excited vibrational levels of the ground elec-
tronic state [4, 5]. The possibility of controlling the pho-
toassociation reaction by use of short laser pulses has
been discussed in theoretical papers [6, 7, 8] and very
recently attempted by two experimental groups [9, 10],
both in the rubidium case. The success of such exper-
iments would create a bridge between the two domains
of cold matter and coherent control, where femtosecond
(fs) pulses are used to probe the dynamics of chemical
reactions and to control the exit channels [11]. Up to
now, photoassociation experiments with fs laser pulses
have achieved destruction of the stable molecules already
existing in the trap rather than creation of additional
molecules. Indeed, whereas cw lasers red-detuned by 0.5-
28 cm−1 relative to the D2 line are eﬃcient in populating
levels in the external well of the 0−
g (5S+5P3/2) poten-
tial [5], the scheme seems to be no longer working with
broadband excitation [9, 10].

u (5S+5P1/2) and 0+

An alternative route is photoassociation with resonant
coupling as realized in Cs2 [12] and RbCs [13]. In the Rb2
case, one populates the 0+
u (5S+5P3/2)
coupled series. Several experimental and theoretical pa-
pers [14, 15, 16] have analyzed the strong perturbations
in the Rb2 vibrational spectra. The resonant coupling
phenomenon has been proposed to optimize the stabi-
lization step in pump-dump experiments [17]. However,
one should ﬁrst make sure that the levels populated in the
photoassociation step do belong to the 0+
u series. The aim
of the present paper is to propose a scheme for identifying
0+
u (5S+5P1/2,3/2) molecules in short-pulse photoassocia-
tion experiments. We consider pulses in the picosecond
range as they populate a limited number of bound vibra-
tional levels. We show that characteristic time-dependent
oscillations appear in photoionization probe signals or in
the number of stabilized molecules.

Time-dependent ﬂuorescence signals manifesting the

coupling between the two series have been previously ob-
served by pump-probe spectroscopy [18]. In this exper-
iment, a molecular beam of Rb2 is excited by a 120-fs
laser pulse, from the v = 0 level of X1Σ+
g to low vibra-
u state, lying ∼ 5600 cm−1 below
tional levels of the A1Σ+
the 5S+5P asymptote with a classical internal turning
point around 8a0. A delayed pulse, operating in a suit-
able detection window around the outer turning point of
the b3Πu potential (12a0), probes the population trans-
ferred to this state. It presents an oscillatory behavior
with several characteristic periods of the order of 1 ps.
This is explained in terms of interferences between sev-
eral paths for the motion of the wavepacket in the ex-
u and b3Πu
cited state, due to the crossing of the A1Σ+
potentials at Rshort ≈ 9.3a0. This crossing can be seen
in Fig. 1(a), where we plot the potential energy curves
corresponding to the two Hund’s case a A1Σ+
u and b3Πu
states [hereafter referred to as VA and Vb], as determined
by Bergeman et al. [19]. We also show the ground state
potential obtained by matching ab initio calculations [20]
n Cn/Rn [21],
to the long-range dispersion potential −
and slightly shifting the repulsive barrier to reproduce
P
the large value of the scattering length [22].

In this paper, we consider photoassociation at a mod-
erate detuning of ≈ 60 cm−1 below the D1 line, exciting
loosely-bound vibrational levels of the coupled system in
the vicinity of the up-to-now unexplored crossing at long
range Rlong ≈ 29.2a0 [Fig. 1(c)]. Indeed, inclusion of the
spin-orbit eﬀective Hamiltonian HSO lowers the energy of
the b state by a quantity asymptoticaly ∼ 79 cm−1, giv-
ing rise to the diabatic curve ¯Vb, that crosses VA at Rlong.
The diagonalization of HSO within the {A, ¯b} subspace
renders two Hund’s case c 0+
u (P3/2) adia-
batic curves, correlated to the 5S+5P1/2 and 5S+5P3/2
asymptotes, splitted by ∆Efs = 237 cm−1. The mixing
angle θ(R) deﬁnes the transformation from the diabatic
to the adiabatic basis at a given internuclear distance R:

by the derivative dθ/dR. We display in Fig. 1(b) the
R-dependence of cos2 θ. There is a sharp variation,
corresponding to a singlet-triplet change of character,
in the region of Rshort where the two diabatic curves
cross abruptly.
In the range of distances from 10 to
15 a0, where the splitting between the diabatic curves
is very large compared to ∆Efs, the mixing angle be-
comes 0, so that 0+
u (P1/2) has a pure singlet character.
For R > 15a0, cos2 θ(R) decreases toward its asymptotic
value 1/3, which, due to the very similar slopes of VA and
¯Vb at large R [cf. Fig. 1(c)], is only reached at distances
far beyond 40a0. A complete mixing with θ = 45◦ occurs
in the vicinity of Rlong. In contrast with the crossing at
Rshort explored in Ref. [18], this long-range crossing is
not localized.

The system – We perform calculations for a system
of 85Rb atoms at a temperature of 100 µK as in usual
photoassociation (PA) experiments [9, 10]. Only s-wave
scattering and J = 0 rotational levels are considered.
The three components of the radial wavefunction cor-
respond to the electronic ground state (X1Σ+
g ≡X), and
singlet (A1Σ+
u ≡A) and triplet excited states (b3Πu≡b).
We introduce a Gaussian chirped pulse of energy Epulse,

ω(t) = ωL + χ · (t − tP ) ,

around the carrier frequency ωL. The laser is red-detuned
from the atomic D1 line at ωD1 by ∆L = ~(ωD1−ωL), χ is
the linear chirp rate in the time domain, while the spec-
tral bandwidth is δω = 4 ln 2/τL ≈ 14.7 cm−1/τL[in ps].
The instantaneous intensity of the pulse involves a Gaus-
sian envelope

with a FWHM equal to τC (≥ τL), the pulse dura-
tion [23]. For this pulse, 98% of the energy Epulse is
delivered in the time window [tP −τC , tP +τC ] over the il-
luminated area σ [7]. During this time, the instantaneous
laser frequency is resonant with all the excited levels with
a binding energy in the range [∆L − ~|χ|τC, ∆L + ~|χ|τC],
which deﬁnes a photoassociation window in energy. For
the case of a single excited state, this can be translated
into a PA window in R by the reﬂection principle [23].

We apply the rotating wave approximation on the
instantaneous frequency to derive the dynamical equa-
tions [7, 8]. In our system, the laser couples the X state
to the A excited channel, with a time dependent cou-
pling ~Ω(t) = −
I(t)/(2cǫ0)a(R)D, where c and ε0 are
the speed of light and permitivity of vacuum, D = 5.201
a.u. is the relevant atomic electric-dipole moment (EDM)
and a(R) accounts for the R-dependence of the molecular
EDM; at large distances a(R) =

2/3.

Numerical treatment – The low temperature of the ex-
perimental systems demands the use of a very large sim-
ulation box for the faithful inclusion as box-states of the
continuum states above threshold [23]. To this end, a nu-
merical grid up to L = 30 000a0 has been built with the
Mapped Grid Method [24] and the dynamical equations
have been time-propagated as in Ref. [7].

From now on, we concentrate on a short PA pulse that
couples the scattering state |X, E = 98.85 µKi with lev-
els ≈ 60 cm−1 below D1 (218 cm−1 below 5S+5P, corre-
sponding to λpump = 798 nm). The pulse is centered at
tP = 50 ps, with τC = 10 ps, χ = 1.47 cm−1 ps−1, and
Epulse = 41 nJ focused on σ = 2.8 × 10−3 cm2. We set
the bandwidth to δω ≈ 15 cm−1 to avoid populating the
dissociative levels in the excited states. The correspond-
ing PA window in energy is indicated by the shaded box
in Fig. 1(c).

Results – We present in Fig. 2 the free evolution of the
wavepacket in the excited states, Ψexc(R, t), well after the
PA pulse has ﬁnished. The photoassociation probability
for a single pair of atoms is 4.21 × 10−6, and most excited
population concentrates around two peaks at 22a0 and
37a0. The relative importance of these peaks changes in
time. For example, the peak at 22a0 that is present at
t = 72 ps, has disappeared at t = 76 ps, but reappears at

This behavior can be understood in terms of quan-
tum interferences between the various stationary lev-
els that form the wavepacket. The excited wavepacket
can be decomposed in the basis formed by the vibra-
tional eigenfunctions φcoup

total population in the excited potentials are constant
after the pulse.

We show in Figs. 3(b) and (c) two φcoup

(R) wavefunc-
tions present in the excited wavepacket under considera-
tion. The wavefunction in the lower panel corresponds to
a level 51 cm−1 below the 5S+5P1/2 limit. It turns out to
be ascribeable to a “0+
u (P1/2) level”, as most of its prob-
ability density is accumulated close to the outer turning
point of this potential at this energy, Rext, 1/2 ≈ 37a0
[black circle in Fig. 1(c)]. More unusual is the wavefunc-
tion in panel (b), which corresponds to a level 54 cm−1
below 5S+5P1/2. This is a typical example of a “resonant
0+
u (P3/2) level” [15]. It features two maxima of proba-
bility, corresponding to the turning points Rext, 1/2 and
Rext, 3/2 ≈ 22a0 [red circle in Fig. 1(c)] in 0+
u (P1/2) and
0+
u (P3/2) respectively. As the instantaneous frequency of
the chirped pulse is resonant with ∼ 15 levels in the cou-
pled 0+
u series, the excited wavepacket will have compo-
nents on stationary levels of both types, thus explaining
the double-peak structure observed in Fig. 2.

Now, it is easy to show that the population density at
an internuclear distance R has a time dependence deter-
mined by all the beating frequencies ωij = (Ei − Ej )/~,
where Ei, Ej are the energies of those levels for which
6= 0. The largest weights in the decomposition cor-
cv′
respond to v′ = 406 and 408. These are two “0+
u (P1/2)”
levels separated by ∆E ≈ 4.24 cm−1, which corresponds
to a beating of 7.85 ps, in agreement with Tbeat.

uncoupled basis formed by the eigenstates of VA and ¯Vb.
In this case, many levels contribute, in particular, levels
outside the energy PA window of the pulse. The largest
contributions actually come from A and ¯b levels with
classical turning points at Rext,1/2 and Rext,3/2, which
correspond to the levels indicated by squares in Fig. 1(c).
In fact, for the two strongly coupled A and ¯b states, a
PA window cannot be deﬁned in energy nor in R.

The observed beating in the population density close
to a particular R can be probed experimentally with a
suitable laser pulse that ionizes the molecule and coher-
ently populates several levels of the lowest Rb+
2 (X2Σ+
g )
potential [25] with classical turning point Rext, + ≈ 22a0.
The stationary wavefunction of one such level is plotted
in Fig. 3(a). Assuming that the ionization process is a
vertical transition, the population tranfer to the ionic
channel will concern the part of the wavepacket that
is close to Rext,+, i.e., the peak around Rext,3/2.
In-
deed, we show in Fig. 4(a) the time evolution of the
g ), v′′|Ψexc(t)i|2 for the levels
overlap
v′′ ∈ [185, 194] that have Rext,+ ≈ 21 − 23a0 and can be
populated using a laser with central wavelength λprobe =
479.8 nm and bandwidth δω ≈ 30 cm−1. The signal
presents a rich structure of peaks and troughs. Never-
theless, the evolution is dominated by three timescales,
roughly T1 ≈ 15 ps, T2 ≈ 4.5 ps and T3 ≈ 28 ps.
These times correspond to the beatings between the lev-
els v′ = 407 and 408 [two “0+
u (P1/2)” levels] for T1,
v′ = 406 and 410 [the ﬁrst one being “0+
u (P1/2)” while
v′ = 410 is a “resonant 0+
u (P3/2)” level, cf. Fig. 3(b)]
for T2, and for T3 both v′ = 405-406 and v′ = 409-
410 [both being “0+
u (P3/2)” beatings]. Quite
remarkably, a similar ionizing pulse designed to probe
the wavepacket close to 37a0 (λprobe = 469.3 nm) would
render a signal where only T1 appears [cf. Fig. 4(b)]: as
the classical turning point of the 0+
u (P3/2) components is
22a0 ≪ 37a0, almost no eﬀect of the 0+
u (P1/2)-0+
u (P3/2)
coupling is expected to show up at this distance.

sonable Franck-Condon factor with |Ψexc(t)i.
In both
cases, the mean value of the vibrational period in the
pure 0+
u (P1/2) potential at this energy, T1/2 ≈ 13 ps, has
an important role. (The stabilization is more eﬃcient to-
ward the higher-lying levels as the corresponding outer
turning points are in the range [Rext,3/2, Rext,1/2].)

In summary, we have studied the dynamics of Rb2
0+
u molecules created by a picosecond PA pulse from
a cold sample of 85Rb atoms. The excited wavepacket
spans ∼ 15 vibrational levels in the coupled 0+
u basis
and presents two maxima of probability at Rext, 1/2 and
Rext, 3/2. The subsequent dynamics shows quantum in-
tereferences, with a beating of the population close to
Rext, 3/2. We have argued that this beating can be
monitored by photoionizing the wavepacket with a laser
with well-deﬁned energy spectrum which, in practice, de-
ﬁnes a window of internuclear distances whose density
probability is probed. We have also analyzed the time-
dependence in a pump-dump sequence to form bound
ground-state molecules. Fourier analysis of these oscil-
lations has been performed, showing a complex pattern
of frequencies that will be published elsewhere. In the
future, we will further study the role of SO coupling in
87Rb and 133Cs samples and with fs PA pulses using a

mask to avoid dissociation.

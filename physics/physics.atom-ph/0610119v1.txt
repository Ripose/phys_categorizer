Abstract.

The radium atom is a promising system for studying parity and time invariance
violating weak interactions. However, available experimental spectroscopic data for
radium is insuﬃcient for designing an optimal experimental setup. We calculate the
energy levels and transition amplitudes for radium states of signiﬁcant interest. Forty
states corresponding to all possible conﬁgurations consisting of the 7s, 7p and 6d single-
electron states as well as the states of the 7s8s, 7s8p and 7s7d conﬁgurations have been
calculated. The energies of ten of these states corresponding to the 6d2, 7s8s, 7p2, and
6d7p conﬁgurations are not known from experiment. Calculations for barium are used
to control the accuracy.

Calculation of energy levels and transition amplitudes for barium and radium

1. Introduction

Studying parity (P ) and time (T ) invariance violating eﬀects in atoms is a way of
searching for new physics beyond the standard model (see, e.g. [1]). These eﬀects
are strongly enhanced in radium atom due to high value of the nuclear charge Z, and
speciﬁc features of the nuclear and electron structure [2, 3, 4]. The atomic electric dipole
moment induced by the T,P-violating nuclear forces and P-violating eﬀects produced
by the nuclear anapole moment are enhanced 3 orders of magnitude in comparison with
previous experiments (the detailed comparison and complete list of references may be
found e.g.
in the review [1]). Preparations for the measurements are currently in
progress at Argonne [5] and Groningen [6, 7].

Detailed knowledge of the positions of the lowest states of an atom as well as
transition probabilities between them is important for the design of cooling and trapping
schemes and for estimation of the enhancement of the P and T -odd eﬀects. Energy
spectrum of Ra was ﬁrst measured by Rasmussen [8] in 1934.
Interpretation of his
data was corrected by Russell [9] also in 1934. Compilation by Moore [10] based on
these two works contains about forty energy levels of radium. There were few more
experimental works on radiums studying Rydberg states [11], hyperﬁne structure and

by Sielzo et al the lifetime and position of the 3Po
1 state of Ra has been measured.
The result for the energy is in excellent agreement with early data by Russell [9] and
Rasmussen [8].

[9] were reliable and accurate.

There were some doubts inspired by theoretical work of Biero´n et al[16] among
experimentalists working with radium on whether the data presented by Rasmussen [8]
This disagreement between theory
and Russell
and experiment motivated our previous calculations [17]. The calculations strongly
favored experimental data. However, the strongest evidence of the correctness of the
experimental data came from recent success in trapping of radium atoms at Argonne.
Corresponding paper which would include among other things new data on experimental
resolution to the D-state location is to be submitted soon [18].

Excellent agreement between theory and experiment for radium and its lighter
analog barium[17] allows us to address next problem - gaps in experimental data for
radium. In particular, it is important to know the positions of the states corresponding
to the 6d2 conﬁguration. The locations of these levels are important when considering
the possibility of laser-cooling and trapping Ba or Ra in the metastable 6s5d 3D3 or
7s6d 3D3 state, respectively. This would be a useful alternative to the relatively slow
and leaky transitions available from the ground 1S0 state. In particular, the 6s5d 3D3 -
5d6p 3F4 transition in barium and the 7s6d 3D3 - 6d7p 3F4 transition in radium could
provide a fast and closed cycling transition. However, the data for barium [19] indicates
that the energies of the 5d2 conﬁguration lie very low, between the 6s6p and the 5d6p

expect that the energies of the 6d2 conﬁguration of radium also lie pretty low. This would

Calculation of energy levels and transition amplitudes for barium and radium

limit the cooling and trapping schemes for radium causing leaking of some transitions
into the states of the 6d2 conﬁguration [18].

The main task of our previous paper [17] was to prove that the experimental data
was correct. Therefore we calculated only energy levels known from experiment.
In
present paper we extend the calculations to include all states of the lowest conﬁgurations
of radium. We calculate energy levels and lifetimes of forty states of the 7s2, 7s7p, 7s6d,
7s8s, 6d7p, 6d2, 7s8p, 7p2 and 7s7d conﬁgurations. For 19 lowest states we also present
detailed data on electric dipole transition amplitudes. Similar calculations for barium
are used to control the accuracy of the calculations.

2. Method of calculations and results for barium

The method of calculations has been described in detail in our previous works [20, 21,
22, 17]. Here we repeat its main points most relevant to present calculations.

The calculations are done in the V N −2 approximation [21] which means that initial
Hartree-Fock procedure is done for a double ionized ion, with two valence electrons
removed. This approach has many advantages. It simpliﬁes the inclusion of the core-
valence correlations by avoiding the so called subtraction diagrams[20, 21]. This in
turn allows one to go beyond second-order of the many-body perturbation theory
(MBPT) in treating core-valence correlations. Inclusion of the higher-order core-valence
correlations signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy of the results [21, 22]. Also, using V N −2
approximation makes calculations for a positive ion and for a neutral atom very similar
providing more opportunities for the control of the accuracy. One more advantage is
that atomic core is independent on the state of valence electrons. Ground and excited
states are treated equally which is important for calculating energy intervals.

Single-electron Hamiltonian for a valence electron has the form

ˆh1 = h0 + ˆΣ1,

where h0 is the relativistic Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian:

ˆh0 = cαp + (β

Ze2
r
and ˆΣ1 is the correlation potential operator which represents correlation interaction of
a valence electron with the core. Calculations for a positive ion are done by solving the
equation

where ǫv and ψv are the energy and wave function of a valence electron. Both ǫv and ψv
include the eﬀect of core-valence correlations and the wave functions ψv are often called
Brueckner orbitals to distinguish them from Hartree-Fock orbitals which do not include
correlations.

The eﬀective Hamiltonian for a neutral two-electron atom is the sum of two
single-electron Hamiltonians plus an operator representing interaction between valence
electrons:

ˆH eﬀ = ˆh1(r1) + ˆh1(r2) + ˆh2(r1, r2).

Interaction between valence electrons is the sum of Coulomb interaction and correlation
correction operator ˆΣ2:

ˆh2 =

+ ˆΣ2(r1, r2),

ˆΣ2 represents screening of Coulomb interaction between valence electrons by core
electrons.

We use standard conﬁguration interaction (CI) technique to solve the Schr¨odinger
equation for two-electron valence states. Two-electron wave function for the valence
electrons Ψ has a form of expansion over single-determinant wave functions

1 and ˆΣ(2)

The most complicated part of the calculations is calculation of the correlation
correction operators ˆΣ1 and ˆΣ2. We use MBPT and Feynman diagram technique to
do the calculations. MBPT expansion for ˆΣ starts from second order. Inclusion of the
second order operators ˆΣ(2)
into eﬀective Hamiltonian (4) accounts for most of
the core-valence correlations. However, further improvement is still possible if higher-
order correlations are included into ˆΣ1. We do this the same way as for a single valence
electron atoms [23]. Two dominating classes of the higher-order diagrams are included
into ˆΣ1 by applying Feynman diagram technique to the part of ˆΣ1 which corresponds to
direct Coulomb interaction. These two classes are (a) screening of Coulomb interaction
between valence and core electrons by other core electrons, and (b) interaction between
an electron excited from the core and the hole in the core created by this excitation [23].
The eﬀect of screening of Coulomb interaction in exchange diagrams is imitated by
introducing screening factors fk into each Coulomb line. We assume that screening
factors fk depend only on the multipolarity of the Coulomb interaction k. It turns out
that the values of fk vary very little from atom to atom and the same values can be
used for all atoms of the ﬁrst and second columns of the periodic table:

f0 = 0.72, f1 = 0.62, f2 = 0.83, f3 = 0.89, f4 = 0.94, f5 = 1.0, . . . .

Calculations show that for atoms like Ba and Ra accurate treatment of ˆΣ1 is more
important than that of ˆΣ2. Therefore we calculate ˆΣ2 in second order of MBPT only.
One needs a complete set of single-electron states to calculate ˆΣ and for construction
of two-electron basis states (7) for the CI calculations. We use the same basis in both
cases. It is constructed using B-spline technique [24, 25]. We use 50 B-splines of order
7 in a cavity of radius Rmax = 40aB, where ab is Bohr radius. Single-electron basis
orbitals in each partial wave are constructed as linear combination of 50 B-splines

The eﬀect of inclusion of second and higher-order ˆΣ into eﬀective Hamiltonian for
two-electron valence states of Ba and Ra was studied in detail in our previous paper [17].
It was also suggested there that the best results can be obtained if ﬁtting parameters
are introduced before ˆΣ1 for each partial wave. The values of these parameters for
Ba found from ﬁtting experimental energies of the 6s2, 6s6p and 6s5d conﬁgurations
are λs = 1.0032,λp = 1.0046 and λd = 0.9164. Note that we keep the same ﬁtting
parameters for ˆΣp1/2 and ˆΣp3/2 as well as for ˆΣd3/2 and ˆΣd5/2. We do this to avoid
false contribution to the ﬁne structure. Fitting of the energies imitate the eﬀects of
higher-order correlations, incompleteness of the basis set, Breit and QED corrections.

Final results for Ba are presented in Table 1. The results for twelve states of the 6s2,
6s5d, 6s6p and 5d6p conﬁgurations are the same as in our previous work. However we
present now 27 more states, including states of very important 5d2 conﬁguration. Note
that corresponding energies absent in Moore book [10] and we use recent compilation by
Curry [19] instead. Parameter ∆ in the Table is the diﬀerence between experimental and
theoretical energies (∆ = Eexpt
Ecalc). The agreement between theory and experiment
is extremely good in most of cases. The largest diﬀerence is for the 5d2 1S0 state. It
is 723 cm−1 or 2.7%. Note however that experimental value for this state came from a
diﬀerent source than all other data and has the largest uncertainty (see [19] for details).
There is a chance that the experimental value is incorrect. The only other large diﬀerence
is for the 5d2 1D2 state. It is 409 cm−1 or 1.8%. For other states of the 5d2 conﬁguration
the diﬀerence between theory and experiment is about 1% or smaller. For most of other
states the diﬀerence is just small fraction of a per cent.

Energy levels of barium where calculated by many authors before [26, 27, 28, 29,
30, 31]. The scope of the present work does not allow us to cite all these results.
Comprehensive review of previous calculations for Ba is a big task while our present
consideration serves very speciﬁc and limited purpose. We just want to demonstrate
that our method work very well for Ba, therefore we can expect the results of similar
quality for Ra which has similar electron structure.

In Table 1 we also present the values of observed and calculated g-factors. Non-

Comparing calculated values of g-factors with observed and non-relativistic values is

In Table 1 we also present calculated values of lifetimes of all considered states.
Only electric dipole (E1) transitions were included in the calculations. Therefore, we
don’t present lifetimes of the long living states which can only decay via magnetic dipole
(M1) or electric quadrupole (E2) transitions.

where d =
consistent potential of the atomic core due to the electric ﬁeld of the photon. The
term with δ ˆV N −2 accounts for the so called RPA (random-phase approximation) or core
polarization correction. The functions Ψi are two-electron basis states (7) and ci are
expansion coeﬃcients for states Ψa and Ψb over basis states Φi as in (6).

Expression (11) is approximate.

It includes dominating contributions to the E1
amplitudes but doesn’t take into account some small corrections. A detailed discussion
of diﬀerent contributions into matrix elements between many-electron wave functions
can be found e.g.
in Ref. [32]. In terms of that paper expression (11) corresponds to
the leading contribution to the eﬀective amplitude (ARPA, see Eq. (22) of Ref. [32]). It
accounts for conﬁguration interaction, core-valence correlations and core polarization
eﬀects. Next, the so called subtraction contribution (ASBT) does not exist in present
calculations since we use the V N −2 approximation. Subtraction terms appear only if
Hartree-Fock procedure includes valence electrons. They account for the diﬀerence
between Hartree-Fock potential and potential of the core in the CI Hamiltonian. In the

V N −2 approximation for a two valence electrons atom these two potentials are identical.
The terms not included into (11) are: the two-particle correction (ATP),the self-energy
correction (Aσ), structure radiation and normalization corrections (see [32] for details).
Using expression (11) gives satisfactory accuracy for most of the cases. However
neglecting other contributions for small amplitudes may lead to some instability of the
results. This is especially true for small amplitudes which vanish in the non-relativistic
limit (∆S > 0, ∆L > 1). Present calculations give only rough estimation of the values
of these amplitudes. However, it doesn’t have much eﬀect on lifetimes since lifetimes
dominate by strong transitions with large amplitudes.

Typical accuracy of the calculations for strong transitions is illustrated by the data
in Table 2. Here we compare some calculated transition probabilities for Ba with the
most accurate experimental data. The probability of the E1 transition from state i to

3. Results for radium

The results of calculations for energies, g-factors and lifetimes of forty lowest states of
radium are presented in Table 3. Energies are compared with available experimental
data. Calculations follow the same procedure as for barium. The only diﬀerence is in
values of rescaling parameters for correlation potential ˆΣ. Fitting of the experimental
energies of the 7s2, 7s7p and 7s6d conﬁgurations leads to the following values of the
rescaling parameters: λs = 1.0021,λp = 1.0053 and λd = 0.9327. These values are very
close to similar values for barium (see above). The Coulomb integrals and correlation
corrections in electronic analogues (e.g. Ba and Ra) usually have approximately the
same values. This fact may be used to extract unaccounted higher correlation corrections
Indeed, the

diﬀerences between theory and experiment for similar states of radium and barium
are very close at least for lower states. This is in spite of diﬀerent order of levels,
about 2.5 times diﬀerence in ﬁne structure intervals (spin-orbit interaction increases
Z 2) and some diﬀerence in ﬁtting parameters for the correlation potential. This
∼
means that the diﬀerence between theory and experiment for barium can be used to
improve the predicted positions of those states of radium for which experimental data
is absent. Column Extrap. in Table 3 presents energies of radium corrected using the
diﬀerence between theory and experiment for barium. States where experimental data is
available illustrate that the procedure leads to systematic improvement of the agreement
between theory and experiment for lower states of radium. For states where there is no
experimental data extrapolated values give better prediction of the energies than just
ab initio calculations.

Note that this procedure doesn’t work for higher states. This is because saturation
of the basis in the CI calculations rapidly deteriorates with the increase of the excitation

energy. Since the energies of similar excited conﬁgurations of Ba and Ra are signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent the eﬀect of incompleteness of the basis is diﬀerent too.

Experimental data for g-factors of radium is not available. However, comparing
S scheme still
calculated and non-relativistic values of g-factors indicates that the L
works very well for the most of the lower states of Ra and can be unambiguously used to
name the states. The L
S scheme breaks higher in the spectrum due to the combination
of relativistic eﬀects and conﬁguration mixing. For example, as can be seen from Table 3
states 7s8p 3Po
1 are strongly mixed. The calculated g-factors of
each of these states deviate signiﬁcantly from the non-relativistic values. This makes it
diﬃcult to identify the states. Also, strong conﬁguration mixing is probably the reason
for poor agreement between theory and experiment for the energies of these states.

Calculation of energy levels and transition amplitudes for barium and radium

11

Lifetimes of the states presented in Table 3 were calculated using Eqs. (11) and (12)
for all possible electric dipole transitions from a given state to lower states. This involves
270 E1-transition amplitudes. It is impractical to present all of them in a table. However,
for considering diﬀerent trapping and cooling schemes it is important to know transition
probabilities between diﬀerent pairs of states rather than just lifetimes. Therefore we
present in Table 4 52 amplitudes between 19 lowest states of radium. This data should
be suﬃcient in most of cases. More data is available from authors on request. Note that
the values of small amplitudes which vanish in non-relativistic limit (∆S > 0, ∆L > 1)
should be considered as rough estimation only (see discussion in previous section).

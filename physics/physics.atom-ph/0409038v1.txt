We report measurements of the lifetimes of the 3d 2D5/2 and 3d 2D3/2 metastable states of a single
laser-cooled 40Ca+ ion in a linear Paul trap. We introduce a new measurement technique based
on high-eﬃciency quantum state detection after coherent excitation to the D5/2 state or incoherent
shelving in the D3/2 state, and subsequent free, unperturbed spontaneous decay. The result for the
natural lifetime of the D5/2 state of 1168(9) ms agrees excellently with the most precise published
value. The lifetime of the D3/2 state is measured with a single ion for the ﬁrst time and yields
1176(11) ms which improves the statistical uncertainty of previous results by a factor of four. We
compare these experimental lifetimes to high-precision ab initio all order calculations and ﬁnd a
very good agreement. These calculations represent an excellent test of high-precision atomic theory
and will serve as a benchmark for the study of parity nonconservation in Ba+ which has similar
atomic structure.

tions make it ideal for the study of the accuracy of various
implementations of the all-order method. The properties
of Ba+ are of interest due to studies of parity nonconser-
vation in heavy atoms and corresponding atomic-physics
tests of the Standard model of the electroweak interac-
tion [12].

INTRODUCTION

The lifetime of the metastable D-levels in Ca+ is of
high relevance in various experimental ﬁelds such as
optical frequency standards, quantum information and
astronomy. Trapped ion optical frequency standards
[1] and optical clocks [2] are based on narrow absorp-
tion lines in single laser-cooled ions. With transition
linewidths in the 1 Hz range [3], Q-values (frequency of
the absorption divided by its spectral width) of ≈ 1015
can be achieved. As the lifetimes of the D-levels in Ca+
are on the order of 1 s, yielding sub-Hz natural linewidths
of the D-S quadrupole transitions, Ca+ has long been
proposed as a promising candidate for a trapped ion fre-
quency standard [4]. Such long lifetimes together with
the ability to completely control the motional and elec-
tronic degrees of freedom of a trapped ion [5] make it
ideally suited for storing and processing quantum infor-
mation [6]. In Ca+ a quantum bit (qubit) of information
can be encoded within the coherent superposition of the
S1/2 ground state and the metastable D5/2 excited state
[7] with very long coherence times [8, 9]. In astronomy,
absorption lines of Ca+ ions are used to explore the kine-
matics and structure of interstellar gas clouds [10, 11]
and the D-level lifetimes are required for interpretation
of the spectroscopic data. On the other hand, in the-
oretical atomic physics Ca+ is an excellent benchmark
problem for atomic structure calculations owing to large
higher-order correlation corrections and its similarity to
Ba+. The size and distribution of the correlation correc-

Experimental investigations of long atomic lifetimes
have proﬁted enormously from the development of ion
trap technology and laser spectroscopy. Early exper-
iments on the measurement of the D-level lifetimes in
40Ca+ [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] used large clouds of ions and
the lifetime was determined by recovery of ﬂuorescence
on the UV-transitions (S1/2 - P1/2 or S1/2 - P3/2, see
Fig. 1) after electron shelving in the D-states or by ob-
serving UV ﬂuorescence after driving transitions from
the D-states to the P-states. Shelving in this context
means that the electron for a certain time remains in a
metastable atomic level which is not part of a driven ﬂuo-
rescence cycle. These lifetime measurements were limited
by deshelving induced by collisions with other ions or the

buﬀer gas used for cooling. Similar results using the same
techniques have been obtained in an ion storage ring [18].

Much more accurate results can be obtained by per-
forming lifetime measurements with single trapped ions
[19, 20, 21, 22, 23] or strings of few trapped ions [24] and
employing the quantum jump technique. This technique
is based on monitoring the ﬂuorescence on the S1/2 - P1/2
dipole transition while at random times the ion is shelved
to the metastable D5/2-state where the ﬂuorescence falls
to the background level. For observing ﬂuorescence both
the S1/2 - P1/2 (397 nm) and the D3/2 - P1/2 (866 nm)
transition have to be driven to prevent the ion from resid-
ing in the metastable D3/2-state. Shelving to the D5/2-
state is initiated by applying laser light at 850 nm (D3/2
- P3/2) [19] or at 729 nm (S1/2 - D5/2) [23]. Statistical
analysis of the ﬂuorescence dark times yields the lifetime
τ . The most precise measurement using this technique
was carried out by Barton et al. [22] who found the result
of τ =1168(7) ms.

Here, we introduce a measurement technique [25] based
on deterministic coherent excitation to the D5/2 state
or incoherent shelving in the D3/2 state, followed by
a waiting period with free spontaneous decay and ﬁ-
nally a measurement of the remaining excitation by high-
eﬃciency quantum state detection. During the waiting
time all lasers are shut oﬀ and no light interacts with
the ion. This method basically is an improved version
of a technique that was used earlier to measure the D3/2
metastable level lifetime in single Ba+ ions [26]. The
main advantage of this ”state detection” method is that
no residual light is present during the measurement which
could aﬀect the free decay of the atom. In addition, it al-
lows for the measurement of the D3/2 level lifetime which
otherwise is inaccessible with the quantum jump tech-
nique. There exist only a few reported D3/2-level lifetime
results for Calcium [15, 16, 18] but none from a single ion
experiment.

Figs. 2 and 3 compare the diﬀerent experimental
[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] and the-
oretical [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] methods and results for
the D5/2- and D3/2-level lifetimes.
From Fig. 2 it is
evident that the single ion measurements are the most
accurate ones. Generally, lifetime measurements on sin-
gle ions or crystallized ion strings are more accurate as
systematic errors, e.g. due to collisions, can be reduced to
the highest possible extend. Therefore, single ion D-level
lifetime measurements for Calcium are of special inter-
est. The existence of accurate D-state lifetime values is
of special interest for theory as well since most studies
of alkali-metal atoms were focused on the measurements
of the lowest nP-state lifetimes and D-states are much
less studied. The properties of D-states are also gener-
ally more complicated to accurately calculate owing to
large correlation corrections.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND METHODS

For the experiments, a single 40Ca+ ion is stored in a
linear Paul trap in an ultra high vacuum (UHV) envi-
ronment (10−11 mbar range). The Paul trap is designed
with four blades separated by 2 mm for radial conﬁne-
ment and two tips separated by 5 mm for axial conﬁne-
ment. Under typical operating conditions we observe
radial and axial motional frequencies (ωr1, ωr2, ωax) =

trap using a 2-step photoionization procedure [33]. The
trapped 40Ca+ ion has a single valence electron and no
hyperﬁne structure (see Fig. 1). Doppler-cooling on the
S1/2−P1/2 transition at 397 nm puts the ion in the Lamb-
Dicke regime [5, 6]. Diode lasers at 866 nm and 854 nm

prevent optical pumping into the D states during cool-
ing and state preparation. For coherent excitation to the
D5/2 state we drive the S1/2 to D5/2 quadrupole transi-
tion at 729 nm. A constant magnetic ﬁeld of 3 G splits
the 10 Zeeman components of the S1/2 – D5/2 multiplet.
We detect whether a transition to D5/2 has occurred by
applying the laser beams at 397 nm and 866 nm and
monitoring the ﬂuorescence of the ion on a photomulti-
plier (PMT), i.e. using the electron shelving technique
[34]. The internal state of the ion is discriminated with
an eﬃciency close to 100% within approximately 3 ms
[35]. The following stabilized laser sources are used in
the experiment: two frequency-stabilized diode lasers at
866 nm and 854 nm with linewidths of ≈ 10 kHz and
two Ti:Sa lasers at 729 nm (< 100 Hz linewidth) and
794 nm (< 100 kHz linewidth), of which the 794 nm laser
is externally frequency doubled to obtain 397 nm. The
experimental setup and the laser sources are described in
more detail elsewhere [7, 36].

III. MEASUREMENT OF THE D5/2 STATE
LIFETIME

A. Measurement procedure and results

3

This three-step cycle is repeated typically several thou-
sand times. The decay probability p is then determined
as the ratio of D-state results in the second and the
ﬁrst state detections. For the calculation of the D5/2-
state lifetime τ(5/2) we use an exponential ﬁt function
(1 − p) = exp{−∆t/τ(5/2)}. For ∆t we use the time in-
terval between the ends of the two detection periods.

Fig. 5 shows the measured D5/2-level excitation proba-
bility (1 − p) after several delay times ranging from 25 ms
up to 5 s. A weighted least squares ﬁt to the data yields
the lifetime τ(5/2) = 1168(9) ms using the ﬁtting func-
tion described above, where the only ﬁtting parameter is
τ(5/2). The statistical error (in brackets) is the 1σ stan-
dard deviation. The ﬁt yields χ2
ν = 0.47, indicating that
the experimental decay is consistent with the expected
exponential decay behavior. The least-squares method
is justiﬁed by the normal distribution of the mean decay
probabilities which is a result of the ’central limit theo-
rem’ of statistics. This was also veriﬁed using simulated
data sets (see next section).

FIG. 4: Simpliﬁed pulse scheme for the D5/2 lifetime mea-
surement: the preparation consists of Doppler cooling, re-
pumping, and optical pumping (2ms); followed by a π-pulse
(few µs) and a detection periods (3.5 ms). The waiting time
is varied between 25 ms and 5 s.

The measurements consist of a repetition of laser pulse
sequences applied to the ion. The sequence generally is
composed of three steps (see Fig. 4):

1. State preparation and Doppler cooling, consisting
of 2 ms of Doppler cooling (397 nm and 866 nm light),
repumping from the D5/2 level (854 nm light) and op-
tical pumping into the S1/2(m=-1/2) Zeeman sublevel
(397 nm σ− polarized light).

2. Coherent excitation at 729 nm with pulse length and
intensity chosen to obtain near unity excitation (π-pulse)
to the D5/2(m = −5/2) Zeeman level.

3. State detection for 3.5 ms by recording the ﬂuores-
cence on the S1/2 - P1/2 transition with a photomulti-
plier. Discrimination between S and D state is achieved
by comparing the ﬂuorescence count rate with a thresh-
old value. The state is measured before and after a ﬁxed
waiting period ∆t to determine whether a decay of the
excited state has happened.

from 25 ms to 5 s plotted on a logarithmic scale. The solid line
is a least squares ﬁt to the data yielding τ(5/2) = 1168(9) ms.
The residuals (diﬀerence of data points and ﬁt curve) of the
ﬁt are shown in the lower diagram.

B. Systematic errors

There are several types of systematic errors that may
aﬀect the lifetime result. In UHV single ion experiments
the biggest error source is usually radiation which irradi-
ates the ion due to insuﬃcient shielding of room light
or insuﬃcient shut-oﬀ of laser beams.
In our experi-
ment, the strongest inﬂuence stems from residual light

at 854 nm. The inﬂuence of this radiation on the D5/2
-level lifetime has been investigated extensively in [22]. If
radiation at 854 nm is present during the delay interval it
may de-excite the D5/2-level to the ground state via the
strongly coupled P3/2-level. This additional ”decay chan-
nel” artiﬁcially shortens the observed lifetime. The ob-
vious source for residual 854 nm radiation is the 854 nm
diode laser itself. In our experiment, it is eliminated by
a fast mechanical shutter [37] which is closed during the
delay interval. The 40 dB attenuation of the double-pass
AOM which usually switches the 854 nm light was shown
to be insuﬃcient: In an earlier experiment without the
shutter the lifetime was determined to 1011(6) ms [8]. In
addition, the results observed without shutter were found
to ﬂuctuate by approximately ±50 ms depending on the
speciﬁc AOM and diode laser adjustments.

Another source for 854 nm radiation is background ﬂu-
orescence at 854 nm from the 866 nm diode laser. To
eliminate this radiation an AOM in single pass with an
attenuation of more than 20 dB was used to shut the
866 nm beam. As the systematic lifetime error with-
out AOM was found to be of the order of a few percent,
this attenuation is suﬃcient. Note that this source of
error cannot, in principle, be directly eliminated in the
quantum-jump technique where 866 nm light must be ra-
diated onto the ion continuously. In that case, the only
way to correct for this systematic error is to measure at
diﬀerent light powers and extrapolate the lifetime to zero
power which in turn implies a larger statistical error. In
summary, radiation at 854 nm did not inﬂuence the mea-
sured D5/2 -level lifetime at the given level of statistical
uncertainty.

The D5/2 -level lifetime could in principle be also re-
duced by transitions between the D-levels, i.e. by a M1-
transition stimulated by thermal radiation. The corre-
sponding transition rate is given by W12 = B12ρ(ν) with
the Einstein coeﬃcient for stimulated emission B12 and
the energy density per unit frequency interval for thermal
radiation ρ(ν). With the rate of spontaneous emission
A12 = (8πhν3/c3)B12, W12 is rewritten as:

W12 =

A12
ehν/kT − 1

(1)

With ν = 1.82 THz and A12 = 2.45×10−6 s−1 taken from
[38] we get W12 = 7.23 × 10−6 s−1 at room temperature
which changes the D5/2 -level lifetime by much less than
the statistical error of our measurement.

lifetime-
enhancing systematic eﬀects. Both radiation at 393 nm
(roomlight) or 729 nm (Ti:Sa laser, double-pass AOM
attenuation of ≈ 40 dB) can lead to re-shelving of the
ion. This eﬀect, however, leads also to a diﬀerent decay
function. It is modeled by a simple rate equation for the
excited state population pD

˙pD = −ΓpD + R(1 − pD)

(2)

where Γ = 1/τ denotes the natural decay rate and R the
reshelving rate induced by laser radiation. The solution

(3)

of eq. (2) is of the form

pD = Ae−Γ

t + B

′

with A = 1−R/Γ′, an oﬀset B = R/Γ′ and the new decay
rate Γ′ = Γ + R. Thus, an oﬀset B is the signature of a
re-shelving rate. The result from ﬁtting the experimental
data in Fig. 5 with the modiﬁed exponential ﬁt function
(3) is τﬁt = 1165(10) ms and Rﬁt = 3(2) × 10−3 s−1.

To evaluate the systematic error due to a repumping
rate R we use the following technique: We generate simu-
lated data sets from random numbers by considering the
fact that the decay probability for a given waiting time
is distributed binomially around a mean that is given by
an exponential function with an expected mean decay
time τ(5/2). For these data sets we also take into account
the particular experimental waiting times and number of
measurements. In this way ’ideal’ data sets are created
that contain a purely statistical variation of data accord-
ing to the experimental settings and that are free of any
systematic errors. First, a ﬁt of Eq. (3) to such an ideal
simulated data set yields an additional repumping rate
R = 0 with a standard deviation of ∆R = 3 × 10−3 s−1.
Thus, the above ﬁtted repumping rate Rﬁt is consistent
with zero and not suﬃciently signiﬁcant to allow any con-
clusion about the actual rate or the model, i.e. the sta-
tistical error is too large for this small systematic error
to be resolved in a ﬁt to the data. Second, to obtain an
upper limit for the systematic error of the lifetime due to
a possible re-pumping rate we assume that such a rate
Rsim exists in the experiment. We then simulate data
sets including the rate Rsim and the lifetime τ(5/2) and
ﬁt these data sets with a normal exponential ﬁt func-
tion (1 − p) = exp (−∆t/τsim). The deviation of the ﬁt
result τsim from τ(5/2) used for the simulation gives the
systematic lifetime error. For Rsim = 3 × 10−3 s−1 this
systematic error is ∆τ = −3 ms.

Another systematic eﬀect that implies a diﬀerent ﬁt
model is the state detection error. Even though the de-
tection eﬃciency is close to unity, Poissonian noise in the
PMT counts and the possibility of a spontaneous decay
during the detection period produce a small error [39].
the probability ε1 to measure the
The ﬁrst error, i.e.
ion in the wrong state due to noise of the count rate,
depends on the discrimination between S and D state in
the electron shelving technique. Such discrimination is
achieved by comparing the ﬂuorescence count rate dur-
ing the detection window with a threshold value. Proper
choice of this threshold value leads to an error as small as
ε1 = 10−5 which can be neglected for the following analy-
sis. The second error, i.e. the probability ε2 for a wrong
state measurement due to spontaneous decay, also de-
pends on the length of the detection window, ﬂuorescent
count rates for the ion in S and D states and the thresh-
old setting. For the chosen parameters in the experiment
we evaluate ε2 = 10−3. The measured excitation proba-
bility is then (1−p)meas = (1−ε2)(1−p)real and implies a
model function of the form (1 − p) = (1 − ε2)e−Γ∆t. A ﬁt
to simulated data as described above yields a statistically

consistent limit for this detection error of ε2 = 1 × 10−3.
Again, it cannot be resolved by a ﬁt to the measured
data. From simulated data including an assumed detec-
tion error of ε2 = 1 × 10−3 we get an upper limit of the
systematic lifetime error ∆τ = 7 ms.

In addition to radiative eﬀects, non-radiative lifetime
reduction mechanisms exist, namely, inelastic collisions
with neutral atoms or molecules from the background
gas. Two relevant types of collisions can be distinguished:
Quenching and j-mixing collisions. Quenching collisions
cause direct deshelving of the ion into the ground state.
In the presence of high quenching rates lifetime measure-
ments have to be done at diﬀerent pressures. An extrap-
olation to zero pressure then yields the natural lifetime.
Measurements of collisional deshelving rates for diﬀer-
ent atomic and molecular species have been performed
in early experiments [14, 16]. Ref. [16] ﬁnds speciﬁc
quenching rates for Ca+ of Γq
H = 37 × 10−12 cm3s−1
for H2, and Γq
N = 170 × 10−12 cm3s−1 for N2. Colli-
sions may also induce a change of the atomic polariza-
tion, a process called j-mixing or ﬁne structure mixing
where a transition from the D5/2 to the D3/2 state or
vice versa is induced. These rates have also been de-
termined in Ref.[16] to Γj
H = 3 × 10−10 cm3s−1 for H2
and Γj
N = 13 × 10−10 cm3s−1 for N2. Such collisional
eﬀects cannot be distinguished from a natural decay pro-
cess. Collisional eﬀects are most prominent in experi-
ments with large clouds of ions or at higher background
pressure. To give an upper limit of the eﬀect in our ex-
periment estimates of the constituents of the background
gas must be made. If a background gas composition of
50% N2 and 50% H2 is assumed [40] and the pressure
p < 2 × 10−11 mbar in the linear ion trap set up is taken
into account, an upper limit for the additional collision
induced rate of γ = 3×10−4 s−1 is calculated. This eﬀect
is well below a 10−3 relative error and can be neglected
here.

In summary, the result for the lifetime of the D5/2 level
can be quoted as: τ(5/2) = 1168 ms ±9 ms (statistical)
-3 ms (repumping rate) +7 ms (detection).

IV. MEASUREMENT OF THE D3/2 STATE
LIFETIME

A. Measurement procedure and results

For the measurement of the D3/2-level lifetime some al-
terations in the pulse sequence are required (see Fig. 6).
To populate the D3/2 state we use indirect shelving by
driving the S-P transition at 397 nm and taking advan-
tage of the 1:16 branching ratio into the D3/2 level. After
a few microseconds the D3/2 level is populated with unity
probability.

Furthermore, because that level is part of the closed 3-
level ﬂuorescence cycle used for state detection its popu-
lation cannot be probed with the state detection scheme
described in the previous paragraph. In that sense the

5

D3/2 level is not a shelved state. The method used here
is that prior to state detection the decayed population
is transferred to the D5/2 shelving state. The measured
excitation probability of the D5/2 state divided by the
shelving probability then corresponds to the decay prob-
ability from the D3/2 level and the further analysis is
analogous to the one in Sec. III. Shelving in the D5/2
state is achieved by coherent excitation (π-pulse). How-
ever, it must be taken into account that the D3/2 state
may decay into both Zeeman sublevels of the S1/2 ground
state. Hence, two π pulses from both sublevels are re-
quired to transfer all decayed population to the D5/2-
state.
In our experiment we chose the two ∆mj = 2
transitions (mj = −1/2 to mj = −5/2 and mj = 1/2
to mj = 5/2). The combined transfer eﬃciency Pπ of
the two pulses is determined in the ﬁrst part of the pulse
sequence (cf. Fig. 6): after Doppler cooling the ion is not
optically pumped into the S1/2(mj = −1/2) ground state
as usual but might populate both Zeeman sublevels. The
measured transfer eﬃciency Pπ is used for calculation of
the decay probability.

FIG. 6: Simpliﬁed pulse scheme for the D3/2 lifetime mea-
surement. It consists of a measurement of the π-pulse trans-
fer eﬃciency on the S1/2-D5/2 transition (prep, π and det1);
D3/2-state preparation (prep, s); waiting period ∆t and state
detection (π and det2). For details of the pulse sequence see
text. The waiting time is varied between 25 ms and 5 s.

The measurement of the D3/2-level lifetime τ(3/2) thus
consists of a repetition of the following laser pulse se-
quences applied to the ion. The sequence generally is
composed of three steps (cf. Fig. 6):

1. Measurement of transfer eﬃciency Pπ: state prepa-
ration and Doppler cooling, consisting of 2 ms of Doppler
cooling (397 nm and 866 nm light), repumping from
the D5/2 level (854 nm light) and spontaneous decay
into the S1/2(m=-1/2) or (m=+1/2) Zeeman sublevel;
π-pulses on the S1/2 to D5/2 transitions (mj = −1/2 to
mj = −5/2 and mj = 1/2 to mj = 5/2); state detection
for 3.5 ms by recording the ﬂuorescence on the S1/2 -
P1/2 transition with a photomultiplier.

2. State preparation and shelving in the D3/2-level:
2 ms of Doppler cooling (397 nm and 866 nm light),
repumping from the D5/2 level (854 nm light) and op-
tical pumping into the S1/2(m=-1/2) Zeeman sublevel
(397 nm σ− polarized light); shelving pulse at 397 nm
for a few µs.

3. Measurement of decay probability: free decay for a
variable delay time; π-pulses on the S1/2 to D5/2 tran-
sitions (mj = −1/2 to mj = −5/2 and mj = 1/2 to

mj = 5/2); state detection for 3.5 ms by recording the
ﬂuorescence on the S1/2 - P1/2 transition with a photo-
multiplier.

The measured D3/2-level excitation probability (1 − p)
is plotted vs. various delay times between 25 ms and
2 s in Fig. 7. Again, the data have been ﬁtted using
the least squares method and the ﬁt function 1 − p =
exp(−∆t/τ(3/2)). Here, p denotes the corrected decay
probability p = Pex/Pπ, i.e. the detected excitation of
the D5/2 level Pex corrected for the near-unity shelving
probability Pπ (which is typically 0.98-0.99 on average).
Since there is no correlation between Pπ and Pex in one
experiment it is more appropriate to use for the correc-
tion the average of Pπ for each delay time. The output
from the ﬁt is τ(3/2) = 1176(11) ms with χ2
ν = 0.68 indi-
cating good agreement of data and exponential model.

FIG. 7: D3/2-level excitation probability for delay times from
25 ms to 2 s plotted on a logarithmic scale. The solid line is
a least squares ﬁt to the data yielding τ(3/2) = 1176(11) ms.
The residuals (diﬀerence of data points and ﬁt curve) of the
ﬁt are shown in the lower diagram.

B. Systematic errors

Also for this experiment systematic errors due to resid-
ual light have to be investigated. The measured lifetime
might be reduced by residual light at 866 nm or 850 nm
present during the delay interval. This light would de-
excite the D3/2 level via the P1/2- or P3/2-levels, respec-
tively, and results in a faster eﬀective decay rate. The
main source of light at 866 nm is the corresponding diode
laser itself which is switched with a single pass AOM with
an attenuation of 20 dB. As this attenuation was found
to be insuﬃcient a fast mechanical shutter (cf. Sec. III)
was installed which remained closed throughout the en-

6

tire waiting period. The ﬂuorescence background of the
854 nm diode laser at 866 nm was found to be negligible.
Light at 850 nm could de-shelve the ion via the P3/2 state
and is expected to mainly originate from the ﬂuorescence
background of the 854 nm diode laser. For this laser, a
double-pass AOM attenuation of 40 dB was proven to
be suﬃcient since no eﬀect on the lifetime could be mea-
sured within a 5% error even if the laser was switched on
at full intensity during the whole waiting time.

Lifetime reducing eﬀects are not obviously detectable
because they only increase the decay rate while the func-
tional shape of the decay curve remains the same, i.e. no
oﬀset is introduced for long delay times. The main con-
cern in our experiment is the 866 nm light and extreme
care has been taken to ensure that the shutter was indeed
closed during the delay time. Before the 397 nm shelving
pulse and between the π pulse and the second detection a
1 ms period has been inserted to allow for shutting time
and jitter. During the lifetime measurements the correct
shutting was checked by monitoring the transmission on
photodiodes. In fact the shutters close fast within about
400 µs but the start time is not well deﬁned and jitters
by about 500 µs.

Lifetime prolonging eﬀects can be induced by residual
light at 397 nm or 729 nm which might re-excite the ion
after it has already decayed. This re-shelving process
can be detected as an oﬀset as already pointed out in
Sec. III. The 397 nm laser light is switched by two single
pass AOMs in series (one before a ﬁber, one behind it,
combined attenuation ≈ 55 dB). Nonetheless, we used a
shutter to exclude the inﬂuence of 397 nm laser light to
the largest possible extent. To give a limit on the sys-
tematic eﬀect of any re-pumping source the same method
as in section III B is applied. The experimental data is
ﬁtted with the rate model function Eq. (3) yielding a rate
of Rﬁt = 3(10) × 10−3 s−1. The standard deviation of R
for an simulated ideal data set is ∆R = 1.5 × 10−2 s−1
(with mean R = 0), so again the rate is concealed by the
statistical error. From simulations an upper limit for the
systematic lifetime error of ∆τ = −2 ms is obtained.

Another source of systematic error is vibrational heat-
ing of the ion during the delay time. If, due to heating,
the transfer eﬃciency Pπ(∆t) is smaller after the waiting
time than Pπ(0) determined in the ﬁrst part of the pulse
sequence the correction for the transfer eﬃciency is too
small and the actual decay rate is higher than measured.
A π pulse only has high transfer eﬃciency if the ion is
in the Lamb-Dicke regime [5, 6], i.e. η2¯n << 1 where η
is the Lamb-Dicke parameter and ¯n is the mean phonon
number. If the factor η2 ¯n becomes signiﬁcant both the
Rabi frequency Ω¯n and the maximum transfer eﬃciency
decrease as Ω¯n = Ω0(1 − η2 ¯n), where Ω0 is the coupling
strength on the S-D transition. Taking the mean phonon
number after Doppler cooling of ¯n ≈ 10 and the measured
heating rate in the linear ion trap of ∂n/∂t ≈ 10 s−1 [35]
we can estimate the transfer eﬃciency after a waiting
time of 2 s, Pπ(2 s) = 0.98 if the π-pulse time was initially
chosen to fulﬁll Pπ(0) = 1. We experimentally checked

the degradation of transfer eﬃciency with waiting time
by introducing a delay time ∆t between the Doppler cool-
ing pulse and the π-pulse in the ﬁrst step of the pulse
sequence and subsequently performing a state detection
measurement. Figure 8 shows an average of various mea-
surements of π-pulse transfer eﬃciency Pπ(∆t) vs. delay
time ∆t. A linear ﬁt Pπ(∆t) = 1 − a∆t to the data

FIG. 8: Average transfer eﬃciency of the π-pulses on the S1/2
to D5/2 transition after various delay times between Doppler
cooling and π-pulses.

yields a = −4(2) × 10−3 s−1. With simulated data sets
including such a decreasing transfer eﬃciency Pπ(∆t) we
determine a systematic lifetime error of ∆τ = −7 ms.

Finally, the detection error is considered, in analogy to
section III B. From simulated data sets with a detection
error of ε2 = 1 × 10−3 a systematic error for the life-
time of ∆τ = +8 ms is found. Systematic errors due to
collisional eﬀects (quenching and j-mixing) can be again
neglected as argued above.

Summarizing the analysis, the lifetime for the D3/2
level is given as: τ(3/2) = 1176 ms ±11 ms (statistical)
-2 ms (repumping rate) -7 ms (heating) +8 ms (detection
error).

V. AB INITIO ALL ORDER CALCULATION OF
THE D-STATES LIFETIMES

We conducted the calculation of the 3d 2D3/2 - 4s
2S1/2 and 3d 2D5/2 - 4s 2S1/2 electric-quadrupole ma-
trix elements in Ca+ using a relativistic all-order method
which sums inﬁnite sets of many-body perturbation the-
ory terms. These matrix elements are used to evaluate
the 3d-level radiative lifetimes and their ratio.

In this particular implementation of the all-order
method, the wave function of the valence electron v is

where Φv is the lowest-order atomic wave function, which
is taken to be the frozen-core Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF)
wave function of a state v. This lowest-order atomic wave
function can be written as |Φvi = a†
v|0C i, where |0Ci rep-
resents DHF wave function of a closed core. In equation
(4), a†
i and ai are creation and annihilation operators,
respectively. The indices m, n, and r designate excited
states and indices a and b designate core states. The ﬁrst
two lines of Eq. (4) represent the single and double exci-
tation terms. The restriction of the wave function to the
ﬁrst ﬁve terms of Eq. (4) represents a single-double (SD)
approximation. The last term of Eq. (4) represents a class
of the triple excitations and is included in the calculation
partially as described in Ref. [41]. We carried out the all-
order calculation with and without the partial addition
of the triple term; the results of those two calculations
are labeled SD (single-double) and SDpT (single-double
partial triple) data in the text and tables below. The ex-
citation coeﬃcients ρma, ρmv, ρmnab, and ρmnva are ob-
tained as the iterative solutions of the all-order equations
in the ﬁnite basis set. The basis set, used in the present
calculation, consists of the single-particle states, which
are linear combinations of B-splines [42]. The single-
particle orbitals are deﬁned on a non-linear grid and are
constrained to a spherical cavity. The cavity radius is
chosen to accommodate the 4s and 3d orbitals.

The matrix element of the operator Z for the tran-
sition between the states w and v is obtained from the
expansion (4) using

Zwv =

hΨw|Z|Ψvi
hΨv|ΨvihΨw|Ψwi

.

The resulting expression for the numerator of the Eq. (5)
consists of terms that are linear or quadratic functions
of the excitation coeﬃcients. We refer the reader to
Refs. [41, 43, 44] for further description of the all-order
method.

The numerical implementation of the all-order method
requires to carry out the sums over the entire basis set.
We truncate those sums at some value of the orbital an-
gular momentum lmax; lmax = 6 in the current all-order
calculation. The contributions of the excited states with
higher values of l which are small but signiﬁcant for the
considered transitions, are evaluated in the third-order
many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). To evaluate
those contributions, we carried out a third-order MBPT
calculation with the same basis set and lmax, used the

TABLE I: Electric-quadrupole reduced matrix elements E2
in Ca+ (in a.u.) calculated using diﬀerent approximations:
Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF), third-order many-body pertur-
bation theory (Third order), single-double all-order method
(SD), and single-double all-order method including partial
triple excitation contributions (SDpT). The all-order data cal-
culated with lmax = 6 are listed separately. The contribution
of basis set states with orbital angular momentum l = 7 − 10
calculated using third-order MBPT is listed in rows labeled
“Extr.”. This correction is added to obtain the values listed
in rows labeled “SD” and “SDpT”.

aThis value is the diﬀerence of the third-order result obtained
with the same basis set as the all-order calculation (the number
of splines N = 35/40 and lmax = 6) and third-order result with
N = 70 and lmax = 10.

all-order calculation and then repeated the third-order
calculation with larger basis set containing the orbitals
with l up to lmax = 10. The diﬀerence between these
two results is added to the ab initio all-order results.
The convergence of the MBPT terms with l is rather
rapid; the diﬀerences between the third-order calcula-
tions with lmax = 4, 6, 8, 10 are 1.8%, 0.4%, and 0.1%,
respectively. The last number is well below the expected
uncertainty of the current calculation. Thus, the contri-
bution from orbitals with lmax > 10 can be omitted at
the present level of accuracy. The contribution from the
excited states with lmax > 6 relative to the total value
of the matrix elements is signiﬁcantly larger for 4s − 3d
electric-quadrupole transitions (about 0.5%) than for the
primary ns− np electric-dipole transitions in alkali-metal
atoms. We note that while the all-order matrix elements
contain the entire third-order perturbation theory con-
tribution there is no straightforward and simple way to
directly separate it out (see Ref. [45] for the all-order vs.
perturbation theory term correspondence issue). Thus,
we have conducted a separate third-order calculation fol-
lowing Ref. [46]. The results of the third-order and the

8

all-order calculations (with and without partial inclusion
of the triple excitations) are listed in Table I. The contri-
bution from the excited states with orbital angular mo-
mentum l > 6 calculated as described above is listed in
the row labeled “Extr.”. The all-order values corrected
for the truncation of the higher partial waves are listed
in rows labeled “SD” and “SDpT”.

We also investigated the eﬀect of the Breit interaction
to the values of the electric-quadrupole matrix elements.
The Breit interaction arises from the exchange of a vir-
tual photon between atomic electrons. The static Breit
interaction can be described by the operator

where the ﬁrst part results from instantaneous magnetic
interaction between Dirac currents and the second part
is the retardation correction to the electric interaction
[47]. In Eq. (6), αi are Dirac matrices. The complete
expression for the Breit matrix elements is given in [48].
To calculate the correction to the matrix elements arising
from the Breit interaction, we modiﬁed the generation of
the B-spline basis set to intrinsically include the Breit
interaction on the same footing as the Coulomb inter-
action and repeated the third-order calculation with the
modiﬁed basis set. The diﬀerence between the new val-
ues and the original third-order calculation (conducted
with otherwise identical basis set parameters) is taken
to be the correction due to Breit interaction. We give
the breakdown of the third-order calculation with and
without inclusion of the Breit interaction in Table II.
The Dirac-Hartree-Fock values are given in column DHF.
The random-phase approximation (RPA) values, iterated
to all orders, are listed in column RPA. The third-order
Brueckner-orbital, structure radiation and normalization
terms are listed in the columns BO, SR, and Norm, re-
spectively. The breakdown of the third-order calcula-
tion to RPA, BO, structure radiation and normalization
terms follows that of Ref. [46]. The reader is referred to
Ref. [46] for the detailed description of the third-order
MBPT method and the formulas for all of the terms. We
ﬁnd the Breit correction to the DHF contribution to be
dominant, with the contributions from all other terms be-
ing insigniﬁcant. The total Breit correction is very small
and below the estimated uncertainty of our theoretical
values discussed below. However, the Breit contribution
to the ratio of the matrix elements is found to be small
but signiﬁcant owing to higher accuracy of the ratio.

The procedure described above does not include a
class of the Breit correction contributions referred to in
Ref. [49] as two-body Breit contribution [50]. To con-
duct the study of the possible size of the two-body Breit
contribution we calculated the Breit contribution to 10
diﬀerent electric-dipole matrix elements (6s− 6p, 6s− 7p,
7s − 7p, 7s − 6p, and 5d3/2 − 6p) in Cs using the method
described above and compared those values with the re-
sults from [49]. Cs is chosen as “model” atom as it is a
similar system compared to Ca+. The Breit contribution

to Cs properties was studied in detail owing to its impor-
tance for the interpretation of Cs parity nonconservation
experiments. In Ref. [49], both one-body and dominant
two-body Breit contributions have been taken into ac-
count. We ﬁnd the largest diﬀerence between our data
and that of [49] to be 25%. For most of the transitions,
we either agree to all the digits quoted in [49] or diﬀer by
10% or less. Therefore, the two-body contribution was
not signiﬁcant for any of the Cs electric-dipole transitions
that we could compare with. We agree with the values of
the Breit correction to the DHF matrix elements given in
Ref. [49] exactly, as expected, since the two-body Breit
contribution only aﬀects the correlation part of the cal-
culation. Thus, we found no evidence that the two-body
Breit correction may exceed the already calculated one-
body correction, especially considering the fact that the
Breit correction to the lowest-order DHF value dominates
the one-body Breit correction to the 4s − 3d matrix ele-
ments in Ca+. Therefore, we assume that the two-body
Breit contribution does not exceed the already calculated
part. In summary, the omission of the two-body Breit
interaction introduces an additional uncertainty in our
calculation and we take the uncertainty to be equal to
the value of the correction itself. Most likely, it is an
overly pessimistic assumption based on the comparison
with the calculation of the Breit correction to Cs electric-
dipole matrix elements carried out in Ref. [49].

Next, we use a semi-empirical scaling procedure to
evaluate some classes of the correlation correction omit-
ted by the current all-order calculation. The scaling pro-
cedure is described in Refs. [44, 45]. Brieﬂy, the single-
valence excitation coeﬃcients ρmv are multiplied by the
ratio of the corresponding experimental and theoretical
correlation energies and the calculation of the matrix el-
ements is repeated with those modiﬁed excitation coeﬃ-
cients. This procedure is especially suitable in this partic-
ular study since the matrix element contribution contain-
ing the excitation coeﬃcients ρmv overwhelmingly dom-
inates the correlation correction for the considered here
transitions. We conduct this scaling procedure for both
SD and SDpT calculations; the scaling factors are diﬀer-
ent in these two cases as SD method underestimates and
SDpT method overestimates the correlation energy.

Table III contains the summary of the resulting matrix
elements; the Breit correction is included in all values.
We note that the scaled values only include DHF part of
the Breit correction to avoid possible double counting of
the terms (because of the use of the experimental corre-
lation energy in the scaling procedure). The ﬁnal values
are taken to be scaled SD values based on the compar-
isons of similar calculations in alkali-metal atoms with
experiment [41, 45, 51]. The uncertainty is calculated as
the spread of the scaled values and ab initio SDpT val-
ues. The uncertainty in the Breit interaction calculation
is also included; it is negligible in comparison with the
spread of the values.

We use our ﬁnal theoretical results to calculate the life-
times of the D3/2 and D5/2 states in Ca+. The transition
probabilities Avw are calculated using the formula [52]

where hvkQkwi is the reduced electric-quadrupole matrix
element for the transition between states v and w and λ is
corresponding wavelength in ˚A. The lifetime of the state
v is calculated as

.

In both D3/2 and D5/2 lifetime calculations we consider
P
a single transition contributing to each of the lifetimes.

The transition probabilities of other transitions (M1 D3/2
- S1/2, M1 D5/2 - D3/2, and E2 D5/2 - D3/2) have been
estimated in Ref. [38] and have been found to be 6 to 13
orders of magnitude smaller that the transition probabil-
ities of the D3/2 - S1/2 and D5/2 - S1/2 E2 transitions.
Thus, we neglect these transitions in the present study.
The experimental energy levels from Ref. [53] are used
in our calculation of the lifetimes. From the calculations
we yield τ(3/2) = 1196(11) ms for the D3/2-state and
τ(5/2) = 1165(11) ms for the D5/2-state. These lifetime
values are compared with experimental and other theo-
retical results in Figs. 2 and 3.

The all-order calculation is in agreement with the
present experimental values and recent experiments [22,
23, 24] within the uncertainty bounds. The present calcu-
lation includes the correlation correction, which is large
(23%) for the considered transitions, in the most com-
plete way with comparison to all other previous calcula-
tions [27, 28, 29, 31, 38] and is expected to give the most
accurate result. It is also the only calculation which gives
an estimate of the uncertainty of the theoretical values.
In Ref. [22], the issue of the theoretical ratio of the
τ(3/2)/τ(5/2) lifetimes was raised. It appeared that there
was a disagreement between previously calculated theo-
retical ratios; Barton et al. [22] quotes the values 1.0283
[28], 1.0175 [29], and 1.0335 [31]. Such a disagreement
appears to be rather puzzling since this particular ra-
tio is far less sensitive to the correlation correction than
the values of the corresponding matrix elements. Thus,
we studied the value of the ratio and its uncertainty in
detail. We list the values of the ratio of the D3/2 and
D5/2 lifetimes calculated in various approximations in
Table IV. The experimental energy levels from Ref. [53]
are used in all our calculations of the lifetimes for consis-
tency. We include results with and without the addition
of the Breit correction. As mentioned before, we ﬁnd that
the ratio does not change substantially with the addi-
tion of the correlation correction; in fact, the correlation
only contributes about 0.15% to the ﬁnal value. Thus,
we calculate the uncertainty in the ratio by considering
the spread of the high-precision values of the ratio itself
(SDsc, SDpT, and SDpTsc), rather than calculating the
uncertainty in the ratio from the uncertainties in the in-
dividual matrix elements. We also ﬁnd that the while
the Breit correction to the values of the matrix elements
was insigniﬁcant at the current level of accuracy this is
not the case for the ratio. In fact, the shift of the ratio
values with the addition of the the Breit interaction is of
the same order of magnitude as the spread of the high
precision values as demonstrated in Table IV. We take
the SDsc value to be our ﬁnal result for consistency with
the calculation of the matrix elements. The uncertainty
of the ﬁnal value includes both the uncertainty in the
correlation correction contribution and the uncertainty
in the Breit interaction. As in the case of the individual
matrix elements, the uncertainty in the Breit interaction
is taken to be equal to the contribution itself. The Breit
correction to the ratio is determined as the shift in the

ﬁnal ratio value due to addition of the Breit interaction.

10

We compare our ﬁnal theoretical value of the life-
time ratio with the experiment and other theory in
Table V. The ratios of the other theoretical values
[27, 28, 29, 31, 38] are calculated from the numbers in
the original publications; care was taken to keep the num-
ber of digits in the ratio consistent with the number of
digits in the values of the lifetimes or transitions rates
quoted in the papers. First, we discuss the above men-
tioned discrepancy of the theoretical ratios. Ref. [22] lists
the following ratios: 1.0283 [28], 1.0175 [29], and 1.0335
[31]. We have listed the data from the original publica-
tions in Table V which shows that the actual numbers
with taking into account the number of digits quoted in
the original papers should have been 1271/1236=1.028
[28], 1.16/1.14=1.02 [29], and 1080/1045=1.033 [31]. The
ﬁrst result is essentially a third-order relativistic many-
body perturbation theory calculation with addition of
semi-empirical scaling and omission of the some classes
of small but signiﬁcant third-order terms. It is very close
to our third-order number 1.0286 from Table IV. The
next paper [29] quotes only 3 digits in the lifetime values
(1.16s and 1.14s) so the accuracy is insuﬃcient to obtain
the fourth digit in the ratio. We note that the method de-
scription in [29] is that of the non-relativistic calculation
and it is unclear how the separation to D3/2 and D5/2 life-
times was made. The last calculation yields a larger ratio
but that calculation has serious numerical issues such as
taking only 20 out of 40 B-splines and including too few
partial waves. It also omits all terms except Brueckner-
orbital ones and possibly even third-order Brueckner or-
bital contributions, which are large. The paper is not
clear on the subject of the treatment of the higher-order
contributions. Thus, we do not consider the result of [31]
to be reliable. Therefore, there are essentially no incon-
sistencies in the previously calculated theoretical ratios
when the accuracy of the calculations is taken into ac-
count. Our theoretical value of the lifetime ratio is higher
than the experimental value. The spread of all values in
Table V, including even lowest-order DHF values, is so
small that it does not appear probable that any omitted
Coulomb correlation or two-body Breit interaction can
be responsible for the discrepancy. The only transition
which can actually reduce the value of the theoretical
ratio is the D3/2-S1/2 M1 transition. Thus, an accurate
calculation of this transition rate will be useful in search
for a theoretical explanation of the discrepancy. How-
ever, the transition rate published in [38] is extremely
small (AM1 = 7.39 × 10−11s−1) and has to be incorrect
by many orders of magnitude to aﬀect the ratio at such a
level which does not appear likely since the same calcu-
lation gives a reasonably good (within 18%) number for
the D3/2-S1/2 E2 transition rate.

VI. DISCUSSION

Figures 2 and 3 show an overview of the most recent
experimental and theoretical results for the lifetime of the
D5/2 and D3/2 states, respectively, in an chronological or-
der. It is remarkable that the theoretical predictions scat-
ter rather widely, with no noticeable convergence while
the experimental results show a trend towards longer life-
times in the recent years as more systematic errors are
identiﬁed and stamped out.

In comparison with previous work it can be concluded
here that our lifetime result for the D5/2 level agrees with
and thereby conﬁrms the most precise value of Barton
et al.. We stress that this lifetime measurement is an
independent check of earlier results as we used a diﬀerent
measurement technique. In addition, the result for the
D3/2 level represents the ﬁrst single ion measurement and
reduces the statistical uncertainty of the previous values
for the lifetime by a factor of four.

For the calculated lifetimes we ﬁnd excellent agree-
ment of the theoretical all-order lifetimes with the ex-
perimental results. Such agreement demonstrates the
necessity of including partially the triple contributions
to the all-order calculations for these types of transitions
and conﬁrms that scaling of the single-double all-order
results, which is signiﬁcantly simpler and less time con-
suming calculation in comparison with ab initio inclusion
of partial triple excitations, is adequate for these types

of transitions. This is an important result for the evalu-
ation of the accuracy of similar theoretical calculation in
Ba+ which is important to parity violating experiments
in heavy atoms. Such experiments are aimed at the tests
of the Standard model of the electroweak interaction and
at the study of the nuclear anapole moments. One of the
features of most PNC studies in heavy atoms is the need
for comparable accuracy of theoretical and experimental
data. The current study is also of interest in regard to
recently found discrepancy between the 5d lifetimes and
the 6s − 6p Stark shifts in Cs [54]. Atomic properties of
cesium were studied extensively by both experimental-
ists and theorists owing to a high-precision measurement
of parity non-conserving amplitude in this atom. Both
of these quantities depend on the values of the 5d − 6p
matrix elements. While those matrix elements are the
electric-dipole ones rather than the electric-quadrupole
ones studied here, the calculation itself as well as the
breakdown of the correlation correction terms is very sim-
ilar to the present calculation. Thus, the current study
presents an important benchmark in the ﬁeld of high-
precision measurements and calculations. The study of
the lifetime ratio demonstrated that the Breit interac-
tion, which produces only a very small correction to the
values of the actual matrix elements,
is important in
high-precision calculations of the corresponding matrix
element ratios.

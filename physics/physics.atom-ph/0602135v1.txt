With ultracold 88Sr in a 1D magic wavelength optical lattice, we performed narrow line photoas-
sociation spectroscopy near the 1S0−3P1 intercombination transition. Nine least-bound vibrational
molecular levels associated with the long-range 0u and 1u potential energy surfaces were measured
and identiﬁed. A simple theoretical model accurately describes the level positions and treats the
eﬀects of the lattice conﬁnement on the line shapes. The measured resonance strengths show that
optical tuning of the ground state scattering length should be possible without signiﬁcant atom loss.

ventional molecular spectroscopy that probes the most
deeply bound vibrational levels of diﬀerent electronic
states, PA spectroscopy excites the vibrational levels
close to the dissociation limit, where the molecular prop-
erties depend mostly on the long-range dipole-dipole in-
teratomic interactions. Molecular potentials are much
simpler at long range than at short range, and are di-
rectly related to the basic atomic properties such as the
excited state lifetime and the s-wave scattering length.

In this Letter, we report the use of PA spectroscopy
to resolve nine least-bound vibrational levels of the 88Sr2
3P1 intercombination line. Our iden-
dimer near the 1S0
tiﬁcation of these levels is required for tuning of the
ground state scattering length with low-loss optical Fes-
hbach resonances [10]. This is of great interest for Sr,
since magnetic Feshbach resonances are absent for the
ground state, and the background scattering length is
too small to allow evaporative cooling [9]. In contrast to
prior PA work that utilizes strongly allowed transitions
with typical line widths in the MHz range, here the spin-
forbidden 1S0
3P1 line has a natural width of 7.5 kHz.
This narrow width allows us to measure the least-bound
vibrational levels that would otherwise be obscured by a
broad atomic line, and to observe characteristic thermal
line shapes even at µK atom temperatures. It also per-
mits examination of the unique crossover regime between
the van der Waals and dipole-dipole interactions, that
3P1 dissociation limit. This
occurs in Sr near the 1S0
access to the van der Waals interactions ensures large
bound-bound Franck-Condon factors, and may lead to
more eﬃcient creation of cold ground state Sr2 molecules
with two-color PA than what is possible using broad tran-
sitions. Bosonic 88Sr is ideal for narrow line PA because
of its hyperﬁne-free structure and a high isotopic abun-
dance (83%). In addition, Sr is a candidate atom for op-
tical clocks [11, 12, 13], and PA spectroscopy could help

potentials (not to scale). The ground and excited molecu-
lar states coincide with two ground state atoms, and with
one ground and one excited state atom, respectively, at large
internuclear separations. The ground state has gerade sym-
metry and its energy is given by the potential Vg, while the
excited state ungerade potentials that support dipole tran-
sitions to the ground state are V0u and V1u, the latter with
a small repulsive barrier. All vibrational states of 0u and
1u (dashed and dotted lines, respectively) are separated by
more than the natural line width, permitting high resolution
PA spectroscopy very close to the dissociation limit when the
atoms are suﬃciently cold.

determine density shifts for various clock transitions.

To enable long interrogation times needed for narrow
line photoassociation, we trap Sr atoms in a 1D opti-
cal lattice. This technique also suppresses recoil shifts
and Doppler broadening and thus simpliﬁes the PA line
shapes. The specially chosen lattice wavelength (λmagic)
induces state-insensitive AC Stark shifts that minimize
the perturbing eﬀects of the lattice [14].

Figure 1 illustrates the relevant potential energy curves
for the Sr2 dimer as a function of interatomic separation
R. The photoassociation laser at 689 nm induces allowed
transitions between the separated 1S0 atom continuum at
a temperature T to the vibrational bound levels of the

that allows Doppler- and recoil-free photoassociation spec-
troscopy. The lattice laser intensity is large enough to conﬁne

PA laser co-propagates with the lattice. The 914 nm lattice

to the total atomic angular momentum projections onto
the internuclear axis of 0 and 1, respectively. Although
our calculations, based on the coupled channels method
in Ref. [15], account for the Coriolis mixing between the
0u and 1u states, this mixing is small enough that 0u and
1u are good symmetry labels for classifying the states.
Including the Coriolis mixing is necessary in order to ﬁt
the observed 0u and 1u bound state energies. Only s-
waves (total ground state molecular angular momentum
J = 0) contribute to the absorption (excited state J = 1)
at our low collision energies. The long-range potentials
are given by the C6/R6 van der Waals and C3/R3 dipole-
dipole interactions, plus a rotational term

where h is the Planck constant, µ is the reduced mass,
A0u = J(J + 1) + 2, and A1u = J(J + 1). The values of
C3, C6,0u, and C6,1u are adjusted in our theoretical model
so that bound states exist at the experimentally deter-
mined resonance energies. Since our modeling of the PA
energy levels due to long-range interactions is not sensi-
tive to the details of short-range interactions, the latter
are represented by simple 6-12 Lennard-Jones potentials
whose depths are chosen to approximately match those
in Ref. [16]. The coeﬃcient C3 can be expressed in terms
of the atomic lifetime τ as C3 = 3¯hc3/(4τ ω3), where ¯hω
is the atomic transition energy and c is the speed of light.
Since the C3 and C6 interactions have comparable mag-
nitudes in the region of R relevant to the energy levels
we observe, the standard semiclassical analysis based on
a single interaction

R−n [17] is not applicable.

The experiment is performed with

2 µK 88Sr atoms
that are trapped and cooled in a two-stage magneto-
optical trap (MOT) [18, 19]. As the atoms are cooled in

tice is νz ∼
recoil frequency and the 7.5 kHz line width, resulting in
Doppler- and recoil-free spectroscopy if the PA laser is
collinear with the lattice beam. Figure 2 illustrates the
lattice conﬁguration. The polarizations of the lattice and
PA lasers are linear and orthogonal in order to satisfy the
λmagic condition at 914 nm [14]. The choice of λmagic en-
sures that 1S0 and the magnetic sublevels of 3P1 that are
coupled to 1S0 by the PA laser are Stark shifted by equal
amounts, resulting in the zero net Stark shift for the tran-
sition and consequently eliminating inhomogeneous Stark
broadening and shifts of the PA lines. A 689 nm diode
laser used for PA is oﬀset-locked to a cavity-stabilized
master laser with a sub-kHz spectral width [11, 13].

To trace out the molecular spectra, the PA laser fre-
quency is stepped, and after 320 ms of photoassocia-
tion at a ﬁxed frequency the atoms are released from
the lattice and illuminated with a 461 nm light pulse
(resonant with 1S0
1P1) for atom counting. At a PA
resonance, the atom number drops as excited molecules
form and subsequently decay to ground state molecules
in high vibrational states or hot atoms that cannot re-
main trapped. Figure 3 shows the nine observed PA line
spectra near the dissociation limit.

The line ﬁts for the free-bound transitions are based on
a convolution of a Lorentzian proﬁle with a thermal dis-
tribution of initial kinetic energies [20], as schematically
shown in Fig. 4 (a). In the 1D optical lattice, we work in

the quasi-2D scattering regime, since T
(kB is the Boltzmann constant), and the axial motion is
quantized. For weak PA laser intensities used here, the

Dimensional eﬀects appear in Eq. (5) as a larger density

els were applied, without an appreciable diﬀerence in the
obtained optical lengths. However, the 2D model yields
ν0 corrections of +15(10) kHz that are included in Table
I. The measurement errors in the Table are a combi-
nation of a 30 kHz uncertainty of the atomic reference
for the PA laser, and of the systematic and statistical
reproducibility. The calculated ν0 results are based on
the coupled channels model [15] and were obtained us-
ing C3 = 0.007576 au (τ = 21.35 µs), C6,0u = 3550 au,

ﬁcient knowledge of the short-range potentials, require
the following uncertainties in the long-range parameters:
C3 = 0.0076(1) au (τ = 21.4(2) µs), C6,0u = 3600(200)
au, and C6,1u = 3800(200) au. The theoretical results for
the two PA lines at detunings over 8 GHz disagree with
experiment by 0.1-1% due to a high sensitivity to the
short-range potentials, while all the other lines ﬁt well
within the speciﬁed uncertainties of as low as 10−5.

Since the width of the Sr intercombination line is in
the kHz range, even ultracold temperatures of a few µK
contribute signiﬁcant thermal broadening. Figure 4 (b)
shows two spectra of the
222 MHz PA line taken at
−
T = 1.7 µK and T = 3.5 µK (T was measured from the
time-of-ﬂight atom cloud expansion). The spectrum of
the hotter sample manifests thermal broadening as a tail
on the red-detuned side.

A photoassociation line depth is given by the optical
length [10], lopt, a parameter proportional to the free-
bound Franck-Condon factor and the PA laser intensity.
It is useful for specifying the laser-induced changes in
both elastic and inelastic collision rates that lead to op-
tical control of the atomic scattering length and to atom
loss, respectively. The optical lengths were obtained from
the data and calculated from the Franck-Condon factors

may arise from the calibration of the atomic density and
the focused PA laser intensity. In addition, we observe
line broadening γ1, most likely a result of the residual
magnetic ﬁeld, and any variation in this extra width can
lead to lopt error. The
0.4 MHz resonance is special
due to its very large classical turning point, and its ef-
fective optical length increases with decreasing ε, while
lopt is energy-independent for the other lines (due to the
Wigner threshold law [22]). Therefore, the reported ef-
fective lopt values for the
0.4 MHz line are based on
−
the 2 µK sample temperature with the 1 µK zero-point
energy. In addition, the ﬁtted lopt for this resonance was
multiplied by 2.5 to obtain the value quoted above, since
our calculations show that 60% of the photoassociated
and decayed atoms have insuﬃcient kinetic energies to
10 µK deep trap. The measured and cal-
leave the
culated lopt for the other PA lines can diﬀer by up to
an order of magnitude, but both decrease rapidly as the
magnitude of the detuning increases and are of the order
of lopt/I = 1 a0/(W/cm2) for the most deeply bound lev-
els. The theoretical optical length of the
222 MHz line
was found to have the largest dependence on the assumed
ground state scattering length due to its sensitivity to the
nodal structure of the ground state wave function.

In summary, we have measured a series of nine vibra-
tional levels of the 88Sr2 dimer near the 1S0
3P1 inter-
combination transition. The 20 µs long lifetime of 3P1,
combined with the magic wavelength optical lattice tech-
nique, allowed direct probing of the least-bound state,
and observation of thermal photoassociation line shapes
even at ultracold µK temperatures, with explicit dimen-
sional eﬀects. We have characterized the strengths of the
molecular resonances, and shown that the least-bound
state should allow a unique combination of extensive, yet
low-loss optical control of the 88Sr ground state scatter-
ing length that may enable eﬃcient evaporative cooling.

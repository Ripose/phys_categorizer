A novel modiﬁed oscillator method of calculating energy eigenvalues for colliding ultracold atoms
tightly conﬁned in harmonic potentials is presented and applied to trapped spin-polarized metastable
helium atoms. The perturbed harmonic oscillator problem is characterised by a long asymptotic
region beyond the eﬀective range of the interatomic potential, and a very eﬃcient method for
integrating inwards through this outer region is developed. The calculated eigenvalues for states
with l = 0 agree closely with those computed directly from the radial Schr¨odinger equation for the
trapped atoms using a discrete variable method, and with those computed self-consistently from an
energy-dependent eﬀective scattering length. Finally, the self-consistent method is generalized to
collisions with l 6= 0 and applied to d-wave collisions of metastable helium atoms.

I. INTRODUCTION

An understanding of ultracold collision processes between neutral atoms is crucial to the design and operation of
atom traps, and to the development of novel quantum processes using trapped atoms [1]. The elastic collision rate must
be high enough to produce eﬃcient thermalization during the evaporative cooling phase of magnetostatic trapping,
whereas the inelastic collision rate must be small, because such collisions can generate energetic atoms and change the
atomic state, hence destroying the trapping conditions and producing trap loss. Elastic collisions are also important in
studies of Bose-Einstein condensates where they determine the mean ﬁeld of the condensate [2]. Ultracold collisions
are usually studied under weak trapping conditions in which the conﬁning inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld is either
ignored or is assumed to have a parabolic or harmonic spatial variation of suﬃciently low frequency (typically 102 Hz)
that it can be treated as uniform during the collision. However, recent interest in phenomena such as quantum phase
transitions of 87Rb atoms conﬁned in three-dimensional optical lattices [3], and far oﬀ-resonance three-dimensional
optical lattices to store metastable argon atoms [4] or to implement quantum logic gates and create highly entangled
quantum states [5], involve conditions where the trapping frequency is typically 105 to 106 Hz and the tight trapping
environment is expected to signiﬁcantly modify the properties of the colliding system.

In several existing calculations for tightly conﬁned neutral atoms the exact interatomic potential is replaced by the

regularised δ- function pseudopotential

where a is the scattering length and M is the reduced mass of the system. This potential reproduces the s-wave
phase shifts in the Wigner threshold regime and also the correct asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction at large r.
This enables an analytical solution for the case of a spherically symmetric harmonic trap to be obtained [6], with the
energy eigenvalues determined from the condition

of this approach has been investigated by Tiesinga et al. [7] for the Na and Cs systems by comparing the energy
eigenvalues with those computed numerically using the best available full interatomic potentials. They ﬁnd that this
approximation is limited to suﬃciently weak traps where ξ

in which an energy-dependent eﬀective scattering length

is introduced, where ¯hk = √2M E and δ0(k) is the s-wave phase shift for the untrapped atoms scattering in the
interatomic potential. The energy eigenvalue condition

is then solved self-consistently. The procedure given in (3) and (4) reproduces the asymptotic wavefunction and the
s-wave phase shifts even at energies above the Wigner threshold regime, and it is found that this self-consistent (SC)
method works even when aef f /ξ

In this paper we report a novel modiﬁed oscillator (MO) approach to the study of conﬁnement eﬀects on ultracold
collisions. This MO method is an adaptation of a technique developed by one of the authors (GP) for highly excited
states in a modiﬁed Coulomb potential. This method is applicable to a system of two arbitrary ultracold neutral
atoms interacting in a harmonic trap, and, as an example, we consider the case of spin-polarized metastable helium
tightly conﬁned in a spherically symmetric harmonic trap as this system has not been studied before under these
conditions.

Interest in collision processes in metastable 23S helium (denoted by He∗) has been generated by the quest to attain
Bose-Einstein condensation in this system [10,11] and, subsequently, to understand these condensates [12]. Such
condensates are novel in that they are the ﬁrst excited-state condensates and open up new ﬁelds for investigation
such as those of atomic correlations and the growth kinematics of the condensate. This experimental success has
depended upon the correctness of the theoretical prediction [13–17] that the inelastic Penning ionization processes
can be strongly suppressed through spin polarization of the He∗ system in the magnetostatic trap.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the formalism is developed for collisions of two neutral atoms in an
external three-dimensional isotropic harmonic trap, and the general nature of the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
of the resultant radial Schr¨odinger equation discussed. A quantum defect is introduced and shown to be analytic in
energy. The MO method is presented in Sec. III and a generalization of the SC method to non s-wave collisions
is formulated in Sec. IV. In Sec. V the MO method is applied to ultracold metastable helium atoms harmonically
conﬁned at diﬀerent trapping frequencies. The results are compared with those computed from the SC method (3)
and by direct numerical solution of the radial Schr¨odinger equation using a discrete variable representation (DVR) of
the kinetic energy operator. Results are also obtained for d-wave collisions of metastable helium in a 10 MHz trap
and ﬁnally, in Sec. VI, we summarize and discuss our results.

II. TWO-ATOM COLLISIONS IN A HARMONIC TRAP

Consider two atoms j = 1, 2 of mass Mj and position rj relative to the centre of the trap. For a central interatomic
, and an isotropic harmonic trap, the two-atom Hamiltonian is separable into

potential V (r), where r =
centre-of-mass and relative motions. The energy eigenvalue equation for relative motion of angular momentum l is

where the reduced mass M = M1M2/(M1 + M2). The trap potential Vtrap(r) = M ω2r2/2 has been assumed to be
independent of the atomic state, which is generally valid in far-detuned optical lattices [18]. As the interaction is
spherically symmetric, ψ(r) has the form

where Ylm(θ, φ) are spherical harmonics and Fkl(r) satisﬁes

In general, the interatomic potential V (r) supports a number of bound states, nb say, for E < 0, so that the lowest
trap state (E > 0) has nr = nb. If however a pseudopotential is used such as Vδ(r) in (1), there are no bound states
with E < 0 and the wave function for the lowest state with E > 0 has no nodes. In this case the number of nodes,
r, and the quantum defect, µ′, are deﬁned by
n′

The diﬀerences between these two types of potential and the eﬀects of their use are discussed in detail by Peach [21].

V. APPLICATION: ULTRACOLD METASTABLE HELIUM ATOMS

As an application of the MO method we consider the case of spin-polarized metastable helium tightly conﬁned
in harmonic traps of various frequencies. The colliding atoms are in the 5Σ+
g molecular state for which we use the
potential of St¨arck and Meyer [23]. This potential has a scattering length of 156.777a0 and supports 15 bound
states. Calculated quantum defects for the 31 lowest trap states with l = 0 are shown in Tables 1 and 2 for trapping
frequencies ranging from 1 to 100 MHz. Also shown are the results obtained using the SC solution of (4). Very
recently Gad´ea et al. [24] have constructed a new 5Σg potential that supports the same number of states but has a
scattering length of 291a0. Experiments [10], [11] suggest that these two scattering lengths represent lower and upper
limits on the exact value.

The most direct approach to the solution of the energy eigenvalue equation (5) is to use a discrete variable represen-
tation (DVR) [25] (usually a Fourier grid) of the kinetic energy operator, and convert the bound state problem into
one involving the diagonalization of a N
N matrix where N , for this single-channel problem, is equal to the number
of grid points. For the 5Σ+
g metastable helium system in a 10 MHz trap, the grid has to extend out to approximately
104)a0 in order that the eigenfunctions of all of the states of interest have exponentially decayed suﬃciently on
(103
−
the outer boundary. On the other hand, the grid must still provide suﬃcient resolution in the repulsive wall region
of the 5Σ+
20, 000. At higher trap
6a0). Computation of the lowest 25 states requires a value of N
frequencies the outer boundary is smaller but, even at 100 MHz, N is still
15, 000. Results obtained from the DVR
method for 10 and 100 MHz traps are also shown in Table 1.

The agreement between the results from the MO and SC approaches is excellent, the absolute diﬀerences being only
O(10−7) at 1 MHz, increasing to O(10−5) for 10, 20 and 50 MHz, and O(10−4) at 100 MHz. The MO results are also
in excellent agreement with those obtained from the DVR method, with the absolute diﬀerences being O(10−6) for all
but the last four states, where the DVR method is beginning to get a little less accurate because the eigenfunctions
have not decayed suﬃciently on the chosen outer boundary of r. For the trapping frequencies considered, the bound
states in the 5Σ+
g potential are relatively unaﬀected by the presence of the harmonic trap. The number of bound
states with E < 0 is still nb = 15, but the most loosely bound state does show some unusual behavior, being shifted
downwards at 1 MHz and upwards at 100 MHz. The trapping frequencies of 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 MHz correspond to
the ratios a/ξ = 0.1167, 0.3691, 0.5221, 0.8255 and 1.167 respectively. The pseudopotential result (2), based upon the
use of an energy-independent scattering length a, breaks down at the higher trapping frequencies. Allowance for the
variation of aeﬀ(E) with energy E is essential in order to obtain the correct eigenvalues; aeﬀ(E) changes sign as it passes
through a divergence at k = 0.01356a

−1
0 , producing a rapid variation in aeﬀ(E)/ξ around E/¯hω

165.6/ν(MHz).

As a test of the generalized self-consistent (GSC) method (49) we have considered the case of spin-polarized
metastable helium atoms in a 10 MHz trap. We have chosen l = 2 since for identical atoms, parity considerations
exclude odd values of l, and in this case the 5Σg potential supports 14 bound states and b2 = 2.383887
0 in (53).
Scaled energy eigenvalues n∗ calculated for the 31 lowest trap states using the MO and GSC methods are given in
Table 3. The two sets of results agree to six signiﬁcant ﬁgures. The associated quantum defects µ′ for l = 2 are much
smaller than the l = 0 quantum defects, increasing from O(10−4) for the lowest states to O(10−2) for the highest
states considered.

A novel modiﬁed oscillator method of calculating energy eigenvalues for colliding ultracold atoms tightly conﬁned
in harmonic potentials has been presented and applied to trapped spin-polarized metastable helium atoms. The

VI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

7

perturbed harmonic oscillator problem is characterised by a long asymptotic region beyond the eﬀective range of the
interatomic potential and an eﬃcient method for integrating inwards through this outer region, has been developed.
The radial Schr¨odinger equation for the relative motion of the harmonically conﬁned atoms is transformed into that
for a modiﬁed Coulomb potential and a quantum defect introduced that is an analytic function of energy. At large
separations r, each eigenfunction for the conﬁned atoms is expressed as a product of the unperturbed harmonic
oscillator eigenfunction and a residual function R(x) that is slowly varying in x = 1/r. The unperturbed function is
calculated by dividing the region into a number of ranges and expanding the function in a power series within each
range. The diﬀerential equation for R(x) is then solved accurately using a grid method requiring relatively few mesh
points. The Schr¨odinger equation is integrated directly through the inner region and the two solutions matched at
r = r0(
40) a0. The eigenvalues are determined very eﬃciently by iteration on an initial estimate obtained by
extrapolating the quantum defects downwards in energy from highly excited trap states.

Energy eigenvalues calculated with the MO method agree closely with those computed directly from the radial
Schr¨odinger equation for the trapped atoms using a DVR method, and with those obtained by a self-consistent
solution that is based upon the introduction of a pseudopotential and an energy-dependent eﬀective scattering length.
The MO method is much faster than the DVR method, especially for the lower trapping frequencies and higher energy
trap states where the DVR integration grid has to extend to very large distances in order to ensure exponentially
vanishing solutions on the outer boundary, resulting in very large matrices that need to be diagonalized.

The higher trap states considered in our comparison of methods to study conﬁnement eﬀects on ultracold collisions
may not be physically realistic. The harmonic approximation to the conﬁning potential of the optical lattice is only
valid for the lower lying states of the atoms conﬁned near the nodes or antinodes of the lattice. Also, the rate of
quantum tunnelling from these higher states to neighboring wells in the lattice may be signiﬁcant, thus requiring a
calculation of the band structure type for the entire lattice.

In future, a full multichannel generalization of our model will be developed in order to include collisional loss
processes and to study the loss rate as a function of trapping frequency. In particular, for trapped metastable helium
atoms, it will be important to include the magnetic dipole-dipole interactions that couple the spin-polarized 5Σ+
g state
to the 1Σ+
g state from which there is a high probability of loss through Penning and associative ionization at small
interatomic separations.

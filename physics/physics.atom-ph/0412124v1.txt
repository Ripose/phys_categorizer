Weak interactions within a nucleus generate a nuclear spin dependent parity violating electro-
magnetic moment; the anapole moment.
In heavy nuclei, the anapole moment is the dominant
contribution to spin-dependent atomic parity violation. We analyze a method to measure the nu-
clear anapole moment through the electric dipole transition it induces between hyperﬁne states of
the ground level. The method requires tight conﬁnement of the atoms to position them at the
anti-node of a standing wave driving the anapole-induced E1 transiton. We explore the necessary
limits in the number of atoms, excitation ﬁelds, trap type, interrogation method, and systematic
tests necessary for such measurements in francium, the heaviest alkali.

I. INTRODUCTION

Parity nonconservation (PNC) in atoms comes from
two types of interaction: Nuclear spin independent and
nuclear spin dependent [1]. Nuclear spin dependent PNC
occurs in three ways [2,3]: An electron interacts weakly
with a single valence nucleon (nucleon axial-vector cur-
rent AnVe), the nuclear chiral current created by weak
interactions between nucleons (anapole moment), and
the combined action of the hyperﬁne interaction and the
spin-independent Z 0 exchange interaction from nucleon
vector currents (VnAe). [4,5].

Zel’dovich ﬁrst proposed the existence of the nuclear
anapole moment in 1957 [6]. Vetter et al. [7] obtained a
limit for its value in thallium, and it was measured with
an accuracy of 15% through the hyperﬁne dependence
of atomic parity nonconservation in cesium by Wood et
al. [8,9]. Previous studies have proposed measuring the
anapole moment more directly through hyperﬁne transi-
tions in alkali atoms [10–14]. In this paper, we study the
feasibility of measuring the anapole moment through the
electric dipole transitions it induces between the hyper-
ﬁne levels of the ground state in alkali atoms held in a
dipole trap. Since the anapole moment scales as Z2/3 and
the matrix element scales as Z2, with Z the atomic num-
ber, we focus our study primarily on francium isotopes,
the heaviest of the alkali atoms [15]. Recent work related
to time-reversal invariance tests in traps [16,17] points to
the many potential advantages of combining traps with
tests of fundamental symmetries, but also highlights the

systematics errors present in such measurements, indi-
cating further work is needed.

The organization of the paper is as follows: Section II
gives the theoretical background for the nuclear anapole
moment, section III explains the proposed measurement
method, section IV presents an analysis of the systematic
eﬀects, and section V contains the conclusions.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

Parity violating atomic transitions are generated pri-
marily by the exchange of weak neutral currents between
electrons and nucleons. These currents can be of two
kinds, depending on whether the electron or the nucleon
gives the axial vector current. Assuming an inﬁnitely
heavy nucleon without radiative corrections, the hamil-
tonian is [18]

A. The anapole moment

The anapole moment of a nucleus is a parity non con-
serving (PNC), time reversal conserving moment that
arises from weak interactions between the nucleons (see
the recent review by Haxton and Wieman [4]). It can be
detected in a PNC electron-nucleus interaction and re-
veals itself in the spin dependent part of the PNC inter-
action. Wood et al. [8,9] measured the anapole moment
of 133Cs by extracting the dependence of atomic PNC on
the hyperﬁne energy levels involved, and consequently
nuclear spin. The measurement shows that atomic PNC
is a unique probe for neutral weak interactions inside the
nucleus, which otherwise remain hidden by much larger
electromagnetic charged currents [20].
The anapole moment is deﬁned by

with J the electromagnetic current density. The anapole
moment in francium arises mainly from the weak inter-
action between the valence nucleons and the core. Flam-
baum, Khriplovich and Sushkov [3] by including weak in-
teractions between nucleons in their calculation of the nu-
clear current density, estimate the anapole moment from
Eq. 6 of a single valence nucleon to be

where j is the nucleon angular momentum. These val-
ues correspond to the nuclear values for the case of a
single valence nucleon. The calculation is based on the
shell model for the nucleus, under the assumption of ho-
mogeneous nuclear density and a core with zero angular
momentum leaving the valence nucleon carrying all the
angular momentum.

B. Calculations of anapole moments of francium
isotopes

We have used Eqs. 5 and 7 to estimate the anapole mo-
ments of the light francium isotopes. In even-neutron iso-
topes, the unpaired valence proton generates the anapole
moment, whereas in the odd-neutron isotopes both the
unpaired valence proton and neutron participate. We
then have an unpaired h9/2 proton for all the isotopes
and an f5/2 neutron for the odd-neutron isotopes.
In
the latter case, one must add vectorially the contribu-
tions from both the proton and the neutron to obtain
the anapole moment

The mixing coeﬃcient is imaginary due to time reversal
symmetry. In practice, the mixing is measured through
the transition amplitude it induces. The presence of ex-
ternal electric and magnetic ﬁelds further modiﬁes the
mixing and must also be included. In the measurement
considered in this paper, the transition amplitude for
209Fr between the hyperﬁne level F =4, m=0 to F =5,
m=-1 with a microwave electric ﬁeld of 476 V/cm oscil-
lating along the x-axis (Fig. 2) and a static magnetic

A more accurate result can be obtained with the use of
many-body methods [5,21,22]. The electric ﬁeld corre-
spond to the expected one for our setup and the static
magnetic ﬁeld is the one required to reduce the sensitivity
of the measurement to magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations

III. MEASUREMENT STRATEGY

We propose a measurement of the nuclear anapole mo-
ment by direct excitation of the microwave E1 transition
between the ground hyperﬁne states of an alkali atom.
The transition is parity forbidden, but is allowed by the
anapole induced mixing of opposite parity states. The
general approach has been suggested and followed in the
past [10–12,23,24]. We modify the suggestion of Fortson
[20] for atomic PNC to use an ion placed at the anti-node
of a standing optical wave. We place many trapped atoms
at the anti-node of a standing microwave ﬁeld, so that the
stability requirements on the interrogated sample are re-
laxed. Nevertheless, the atoms must be well localized
within the anti-node of the standing wave (microwave
6.6 mm
frequency νm ∼
for francium).

45 GHz and wavelength λm ∼

In the case of francium, we prepare the atomic sam-
ple in the following manner. Francium atoms from the
Superconduntinc LINAC at Stony Brook are initially
trapped in a high eﬃciency magneto-optical trap (MOT)
[25], and then transferred to a second MOT in a separate
chamber by means of a push beam. We then load the
atoms into a dipole trap located at the electric ﬁeld anti-
node of a standing wave in a microwave cavity. Given all
the constraints for preparation and transfer of the fran-
cium atoms, we will use a Fabry-Perot conﬁguration for
the microwave cavity.

Once the atoms are in the dipole trap we pump them
into a single Zeeman sublevel. We prepare a coherent su-
perposition of the hyperﬁne ground states with a Raman

pulse of amplitude AR and duration tR. Simultaneously
we drive the E1 transition of amplitude AE1 with the cav-
ity microwave ﬁeld and then measure the population in
the upper hyperﬁne level (normalized by the total num-
ber of atoms (N )) through a cycling transition. At the
end of each sequence the excited state population is given
by

as explained below) we need 300 atoms for a 3% measure-
ment after 104 cycles. With more atoms it will be easier
to study all the systematic eﬀects. It seems reasonable to
expect a sample of 106 francium atoms, which will give
a signal to noise ratio of 20. AE1 depends linearly on κa,
the constant we are trying to measure, so using heavy
atoms such as francium will increase the signal to noise
ratio.

While measurements in francium beneﬁt from a large
AE1, large atomic samples of other alkalis are easily pre-
pared. For example, while the anapole-induced parity
mixing is a factor of 10 smaller in cesium than in fran-
cium, a competitive measurement with the same signal-
to-noise requires a sample population 100 times larger or
N = 108 for the same strength driving ﬁeld. While the
fundamental signal-to-noise indicates the inherent trade-
oﬀs between diﬀerent alkali species, technical noise must
also be considered. Having a large AE1 minimizes the
relative eﬀect of technical noise sources.

At the end the noise will be dominated by technical
noise. The measurement is specially sensitive to detun-
ings. The eﬀect can be reduced by increasing the Raman
pulse to an odd multiple of a π/2 pulse. This does not
change any of the results obtained so far.

A. Signal to noise ratio

B. Apparatus setup

The choice for the value of AR has to take into ac-
count the diﬀerent sources of noise on the measurement.
The signal is maximized for a π/2 Raman pulse. The
measurement of the upper hyperﬁne state population col-
lapses the state of each atom into one of the two hyperﬁne
levels. The collapse distributes the atoms binomially be-
tween the two hyperﬁne levels and leads to an uncertainty
in the measured excited state fraction called projection
noise [26]. The projection noise is given by

Note that the projection noise is zero when all the atoms
are in one of the hyperﬁne levels. We can select the
Raman pulse to reduce the projection noise at the ex-
pense of reducing also the signal. If one includes other
sources of noise such as the photon shot noise, that goes
2, then the optimum operating value for the
as
Raman pulse is still around a π/2 pulse. For a projec-

The atoms are excited by an standing-wave microwave
electric ﬁeld E(t) = E cos(νmt + ψ) cos(kmy)ˆx. The mi-
crowave frequency νm is tuned to the Zeeman-shifted hy-
perﬁne transition frequency ν0. The microwave magnetic
ﬁeld M is deliberately aligned along B; since (for a per-
fect standing wave) M is out of phase with E, we thus
have M(t) = M sin(νmt + ψ) sin(kmy)ˆz, with M = E in
cgs units. As we discuss below, proper alignment of M
and positioning of the standing-wave node is critical for
suppressing systematic eﬀects and line-broadening mech-
anisms. The Raman transition is driven by two plane-
wave optical ﬁelds, ER1(t) = ER1 cos(ωRt + φR)ˆx and
ER2(t) = ER2 cos((ωR + νm)t + φR)ˆz. We assume that
the Raman carrier frequency ωR is detuned suﬃciently
far from optical resonance that only the vector part of
the Raman transition amplitude (V
ER2) is
non-negligible [27]; that is, we ignore the tensor part of
the Raman amplitude. In the rotating wave approxima-
tion the Raman amplitude is given by

cavity axis is along the y-axis. The microwave electric ﬁeld
inside the cavity oscillates along the x-axis. The two Raman
laser beams are polarized along the x-axis and z-axis, respec-
tively. The microwave magnetic ﬁeld and the static magnetic
ﬁeld are both directed along the z-axis. A dipole trap (not
shown) holds the atoms at the anti-node of the microwave
electric ﬁeld.

The various electric and magnetic ﬁelds of the appar-
tus deﬁne a coordinate system related to the measured
rate Ξ±. The transition rate Ξ± depends on three vec-
tors: The polarization of the E1 transition, the polariza-
tion of the Raman transition (V), and the static mag-
netic ﬁeld B which deﬁnes magnetization of the atoms.

The time varying ﬁelds must be all phase locked with
respect to each other. The above pseudoscalar indicates
the methods for changing the handedness of the measure-
ment, a single reversal of any of the ﬁelds will change the
sign of the interference term of Ξ±.

In summary we have the following reversals at our dis-

posal:

1.- Magnetic ﬁeld reversal (β reversal).

2.- A shift of π in the relative phase between the E1

and the Raman ﬁelds (s reversal).

Reversing the magnetic ﬁeld will also reverse the Zee-
man sublevels. In order to reach the correct Zeeman sub-
level the state preparation has to be inverted, meaning
that σ+ light will go into σ− and visceversa. Everything
else will remain the same, including the point of opera-
tion of the static magnetic ﬁeld and the frequency of the
microwave cavity.

C. Magnetic ﬁeld

The stability of the static magnetic ﬁeld, BDC, inﬂu-
ences the precision of the measurement. We want to drive
E1 transitions between two particular Zeeman sublevels,
. The Rabi frequencies, ΩR

|
i
and ΩE1, depend on the detuning of the driving ﬁeld
from the energy diﬀerence of these two states. While the
frequencies of the exciting ﬁelds can be well controlled,
the energy diﬀerence of the Zeeman states is determined
primarily by the static magnetic ﬁeld.

F = 5, m2

i → |

The design of the experiment must minimize the sen-
sitivity to magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. We can choose the
static magnetic ﬁeld such that the energy separation be-
tween levels goes through a minimum. At the minimum,
the energy separation depends quadratically on the mag-
netic ﬁeld. We use the Zeeman sublevels which give the
smallest quadratic dependence. The mixing of levels due
to the magnetic ﬁeld needs to be taken into account to
calculate the E1 amplitude. Table I lists the appropriate
Zeeman sublevels and magnetic ﬁeld which minimize the
eﬀect of magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations for diﬀerent francium
isotopes. The experiment can be made not only between
levels, but also between the

m1 and m2, without changing anything except the state
preparation where on the last step we would need to move
into the other hyperﬁne level. The operating point of the
static magnetic ﬁeld and the frequency of the microwave
cavity would have to be corrected slightly because of the
nuclear spin contribution. Swapping m1 and m2 does
not work as a reversal because the transition amplitudes
change, but it can still be useful as a consistency check.

where B is in Gauss. Under this scheme, control of the
magnetic ﬁeld to 0.06 Gauss (three parts in 105) reduces
the frequency noise due to magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations
down to ∆νm ∼
Even though the experiment takes place in a large mag-
netic ﬁeld, the state preparation and detection have to
be done in an small magnetic ﬁeld. The transition be-
tween both regimes has to be done adiabatically, and
care should be taken to avoid eddy current or hysteresis
eﬀects.

D. M 1 transition

The dominant transition between the two hyperﬁne
states is a magnetic dipole M1 transition. An M1 tran-
sition combined with other imperfections such as a mis-
alignment of the polarization of the microwave ﬁeld will

mimic the parity violating signal. In our proposal, the
magnetic component of the microwave ﬁeld drives these
transitions. In this section, we examine ways to reduce
M1 transitions between the two hyperﬁne states.

Trapped atoms oscillate around the microwave magnetic ﬁeld

Third (see Fig. 3(c)), the atoms in the dipole trap os-
cillate around the microwave magnetic ﬁeld node. When
an atom crosses the node, it sees a microwave magnetic
ﬁeld pointing in the opposite direction. The change
in position eﬀectively ﬂips the phase of the magnetic
ﬁeld which the atom sees, and reverses the evolution
of the transition so that the transition is dynamically
suppressed. The suppression will only take place if the
frequency of oscillation (ζ) of the atoms inside the trap
is larger than the Rabi frequency of the M1 transition.
The suppression factor is given by (1/√N )ΩM1/ζ. The
frequency of oscillation along the cavity axis for our ge-
ometry is ζ/2π

crowave transition at around 45 GHz. We choose to pro-
vide a standing wave microwave ﬁeld with a Fabry-Perot
cavity.

At this frequency, the wavelength of the excitation ﬁeld

Clearly, we need to carefully account for this transition
or strongly reduce it. We choose to suppress it in three
ways.

First (see Fig. 3(a)), we place the atoms at the mag-
netic ﬁeld node (electric ﬁeld anti-node) of the microwave
cavity.
If the dimension of the trap along the cavity
axis is dt = 10 µm, then the magnitude of the mi-
crowave magnetic ﬁeld at the edges is reduced by a factor
= sin(2πdt/λm). At 45 GHz this gives a reduction fac-

Second (see Fig. 3(b)), we direct the polarization of
the M1 ﬁeld to be along the z-axis (Fig. 2). The M1
transitions in this case will be of the type ∆m = 0, but
the transition will not be resonant. The static magnetic
ﬁeld, BDC, splits the magnetic sublevels of the two hy-
perﬁne levels, and the microwave ﬁeld is resonant for the
= 1 E1 transitions (the microwave electric ﬁeld is

polarized along the x axis). The alignment will not be
perfect and so we expect a suppression factor equal to

A waist of 1 cm for the cavity is enough to cover
the 1mm diameter of the atom cloud. We choose a
radius of curvature of Rm=9.9 cm for the cavity mir-
rors to ensure stable cavity, since for our parameters
(d/2Rm))2 < 1. Due to the curvature of the wave-

ization of the microwave ﬁeld. The gradient is smaller

Later, we will show that this rotation is within accept-
able ranges and does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the anapole
moment measurement.

The ﬁeld inside the cavity can be decomposed into a
standing wave and a traveling wave. The presence of the
travelling wave directly generates M1 transitions despite
the location of the atoms at the node of the standing
wave magentic ﬁeld. We can signiﬁcantly reduce the am-
plitude of any intracavity travelling wave by adopting a
symmetrical arrangement in which the microwave ﬁeld
is produced by two identical antennas, one on each mir-
ror. The use of an antenna gives a very high coupling
eﬃciency into the cavity [29] as compared to a slit or a
grating [30]. The electric ﬁeld inside the cavity is given

F. Dipole trap

The atomic sample must remain trapped over the
course of the measurement. We choose to use a far-
detuned dipole trap, since the perturbations produced
by these are small and measurable. A variety of diﬀer-
ent geometries have been proposed over the years. These
include red-detuned traps based on focused beams, and
blue-detuned traps with hollow beams (see Ref. [31,32]
for reviews of recent work). In this section we examine
the eﬀect of a dipole trap on the anapole measurement.
We consider a dipole trap which conﬁnes the atomic
sample to a volume with a 10 µm length along the cavity
axis, and a 1 mm diameter in the radial dimension. The
small axial dimension conﬁnes the atoms to the node of
the magnetic microwave cavity ﬁeld and therefore it has
to be as small as experimentally possible. The transverse
dimension should be smaller than the waist of the cavity
ﬁeld. The atoms are conﬁned to a region smaller than
the microwave wavelength (Lamb-Dicke regime) where
the Doppler broadening becomes negligible. Since we
will use up to 106 atoms for the measurement, the den-
sity of the atomic sample is 1011 cm−3. The use of far
detuned trap will prevent the appearance of light-assisted
collisions.

The depth of the conﬁning potential must be at least
ten times the average temperature of the atoms to avoid
losses through evaporation. The ground state AC Stark
shift produced by far of resonance trap including only
bound state contributions is given by [16]

rad/s the frequency of the 7P1/2 level (λ0 = 817 nm). Nega-
tive intensity indicates that the trap is blue detuned).

The AC Stark shift, which produces the conﬁning force
of the dipole trap, displaces the two hyperﬁne levels
of ground state in the same direction but not by the
same amount. This diﬀerential shift changes the reso-
nant frequency for the cavity-driven E1 transition used
in the anapole moment measurement. For a detuning
we) larger than the hyperﬁne splitting (∆HF S)
(δ = w
the change in the hyperﬁne separation is approximately
equal to (∆HF S/δ)∆E [33]. The advantage of using a
far of resonance trap (FORT) is that we can reduce this
shift considerably.

−

The atoms in the trap will occupy diﬀerent vibrational
levels. For a suﬃciently far detuned trap transitions be-
tween diﬀerent vibrational levels are suppressed. Each vi-
brational level has slightly diﬀerent resonance frequency
which will lead to broadening of the signal and loss of co-
herence. One possible solution is to superimpose an addi-
tional laser to the trap that produces a diﬀerential Stark
shift that exactly cancels the one for the trap. This can
be achieved by tuning the laser frequency exactly in the
middle of the ground hyperﬁne levels and adjusting the
intensity accordingly [33]. The problem with this tech-
nique is that the photon scattering will still be present.
Another option is to use a blue detuned trap such that
the atoms spend more time in the dark. Coherence times
as long as 4.4 s have been proven with a blue detuned
trap, this is 300 times larger than the coherence time
obtained with a red detuned trap under similar condi-
tions [34]. The main source for decoherence in this case
is distribution of Stark shifts felt by the atoms.

Using a laser at 532nm we expect a coherence time
16 times smaller in francium because of the diﬀerence in
hyperﬁne splittings and detunings. The dephasing grows
slowly in time and can be reversed with the use of an
“echo” technique. We can increase the magnitude of the
Raman pulse to (2n + 1)π/2 such that the atoms spend
half of the time in each hyperﬁne level. In this case we
only need to keep the coherence for a time approximately
equal to tc/n with tc the coherence time. Using n=38 we

8

only need a coherence time of 26 ms to have an inter-
action time of 1s. This is below the expected 300 ms
coherence time.

The atoms will oscillate between the dark and bright
regions of the trap and on the walls they will see an
average diﬀerential Stark shift approximately equal to
kT (∆HF S/δ)/h=6.3 Hz. The eﬀect of this time vary-
ing detuning is similar to an steady state detuning of
the same magnitude. Since this can be compensated by
changing slightly the microwave frequency then we only
care about changes on the maximum detuning.

The dipole trap in combination with the cavity ﬁeld
may generate a multi-photon transition. There are four
vectors involved in such transition: E1D, M1D the
dipole trap electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E the microwave
electric ﬁeld and B the static magnetic ﬁeld. We can
form two parity and time reversal conserving observables:
(E1D
E). For both
cases having the dipole laser propagation perpendicular
to the cavity axis will bring their contributions to negli-
gible levels.

IV. TECHNICAL NOISE

We can measure the anapole moment by determining
the population transferred from the lower hyperﬁne level
to the upper hyperﬁne level by the application of the Ra-
man and microwave ﬁelds. Both of these ﬁelds (or any
other stray ﬁeld) are characterized by a ﬁeld amplitude,
frequency (or detuning), and interaction time. We will
assume a common detuning (δ) and interaction time (t).
The total transition amplitude will be given by

A = (AR1 + AE11 + A1) + i(AR2 + AE12 + A2),

(26)

where AR1,R2 are the real and imaginary components of
the Raman amplitude, AE11,E12 the corresponding for
the E1 transition amplitude and A1,2 are the real and
imaginary parts of any other transition present such as
an M1 transition.

Table II shows the phase of the diﬀerent type of tran-
sitions for diﬀerent ﬁeld polarizations. This table also
shows which transitions change sign under magnetic ﬁeld
reversal. Some ﬁelds have an additional phase factor, so
for example the E1 amplitude inside the cavity has to
be multiplied by eiψ, the standing wave M1 ﬁeld inside
the cavity is out of phase with the E1 so it has to be
multiplied by ieiψ, and if we have a travelling wave M1
transition generated by the microwave cavity then it has
to be multiplied by eiψ. ψ is an experimental knob that
we can change to look for systematic eﬀects.

The Raman ﬁeld will be polarized along the y axis so
that AR1 = ARy and the E1 transition is polarized along
the x axis so that AE11 = iAE1x (or ψ = π/2). These
two amplitudes will interfere since both are in phase and

only one (the E1) changes sign under magnetic ﬁeld re-
versal as shown in Table II. Expanding Eq. 15 for large
ARy and everything else small we obtain

The signal and noise terms are contained in Aef f . We
can use this expression to set limits in the diﬀerent ex-
perimental parameters. This expression can also be used

panding the expression for small t we obtain for the ﬁrst

×

We will divide the analysis into three parts: Line
broadening mechanisms which contain terms that induce
some noise in the experiment that averages to zero after
an inﬁnite number of cycles, systematic eﬀects that in-
clude terms that mimic the PNC signal, and calibration
errors that modify the value of the extracted constants
on the PNC signal.

A. Line broadening mechanisms

In this section we will show the requirements for a 3%
measurement on the terms that do not change under re-
versal. The corresponding terms in the last parenthesis of
Eq. 27 have to be controlled to 3AE1 for 104 repetitions.

From Eq. 27 we see that the eﬀect of some of the
noise terms will be reduced if we increase ARy as much
as possible. We can take ARy to be exactly equal to a
(2n + 1)π/2 pulse, and we include any deviation from
this value into A1. We can control the Raman pulse to
0.025% in one second if we are shot noise limited.
In
this case the maximum value we can have for the Raman
pulse is ARy/¯h = 121 rad or n = 38.

1. ARy

2. δ

The detuning has to be controlled to δ = 2.7 rad. The
required accuracy for the microwave ﬁeld frequency is one
part in 1011.

The Raman π/2 pulse, which initially prepares the
atoms, consists of two laser ﬁelds. Both of these must
be phase locked with respect to each other, but also with
respect to the microwave ﬁeld. This is technologically
feasible with diode lasers [35,36]. If necessary the Raman

9

pulse can be substituted by an M1 pulse generated by a
microwave horn. The advantage of using an M1 is that
the ﬁeld will be automatically phase locked with the E1
transition because both come from the same microwave
source.

The dipole trap shifts the levels but as we just showed
earlier, as long as the trap is suﬃciently far detuned the
eﬀects can be reduced. For a trap at 532 nm the Stark
shift will be 6.3 Hz. This shift (or the dipole laser power)
has to remain constant to 7% to be below the limit set
before.

The presence of an M1 transition will produce an AC
3

shift of the levels. The value of the maximum shift is
mHz which is negligible.

∼

For what follows we will ignore the detuning and we
will concentrate only in the amplitudes involved in the
experiment. The amplitudes of interest are the Raman
amplitudes ARx,Ry, the E1 amplitude AE1x, an M1 tran-
sition that is in phase with the E1 ﬁeld AMix,Miy and an
M1 transition that is π/2 out of phase with the E1 ﬁeld
AMox,Moy. As an example, if the standing wave mag-
netic ﬁeld inside of the cavity is tilted towards the x axis
it will generate an amplitude AMox since this ﬁeld will
be out of phase with the E1 ﬁeld. The M1 amplitudes
are included into Eq. 27 as A1 or A2 depending on their
phase relation to ARy.

The most interesting values for the relative phase (ψ)
between the E1 and the Raman transition are multiples
of π/2. First we will study the case with ψ = 0, π. This
does not correspond to the PNC measurement since the
E1 transition and the Raman transition will be out of
phase and therefore they will not interfere. The signal
obtained with this conﬁguration will be helpful in the
evaluation of unwanted contributions. Using Table II we
can rewrite Aef f from Eq. 27 as

This corresponds to the experimental condition for the
PNC measurement. The PNC signal is contained in the
last term, and it changes sign under both reversals as
it should. This is how reversals can be used to isolate

−

the signal from other contributions. The other terms
that have the same behavior under reversals constitute
the systematic eﬀects and these are the most dangerous
terms. We continue with the analysis of the terms that
do not have the same behavior under reversals and can
be isolated.

3. A2

Rx/ARy

This term appears due to a bad polarization alignment
of the Raman ﬁeld. If we assume that the polarization of
the Raman ﬁeld can be adjusted to one part in 103 then
this requirement is fulﬁlled.

4. isARyAM iy/ARy

Most of the terms that depend on the M1 transition are
multiplied by an small number such as ARx/ARy. This
is not the case for this term so we must understand its
origin and magnitude.

The magnetic microwave ﬁeld inside the cavity is out
of phase with respect to the electric ﬁeld because it is an
standing wave. Imperfections on the standing wave may
create travelling wave components that may be in or out
of phase with respect to the microwave electric ﬁeld.

Eq. 24 gives the amplitude of the travelling wave ex-
pected in our setup. The travelling wave is polarized
along the z axis, so we can include the polarization sup-
pression factor of 10−3. Combining these two numbers
with the amplitude for the M1 transition we get an am-
plitude which is 0.25AE1 and is out of phase with the E1
transition or an amplitude of 0.75AE1 which is in phase.
This is enough for the requirement of AMiy < 3AE1x.

The relative phase between both antennas (ϑ) can be
adjusted by minimizing the M1 contribution when the
magnetic ﬁeld is tilted slightly. The antennas phase mis-
match contribution will be smaller than the one just men-
tioned if ϑ < 0.01 rad.

B. Systematic eﬀects

The constraint in the terms that mimic the PNC sig-
nal is stronger since these terms do not average out. To
get a 3% measurement their contribution must be below
0.03AE1.

1. sβARxAM oy/ARy

This term appears because of a combination of mis-
alignment of the Raman ﬁeld, misalignment of the mi-
crowave ﬁeld, or imperfections in the microwave cav-

R1×

×

·

2. sβARyAM ox/ARy

This term has the same origin as the previous one, but
now its contribution is considerably larger since now is
multiplied by ARy. This is the most dangerous term and
eventually the limiting factor in the precision of the mea-
surement. To reduce this term one depends completely
on the suppression mechanisms. For a 3% measurement
we must maintain the suppression mechanisms to that
level also.

The cavity mirrors may have some birefringence, which
will generate a microwave magnetic x-axis component.
For the cavity we have considered, the microwaves make
roughly 100 reﬂections. To keep the M1 suppression the
same then we want a polarization rotation smaller than
10−3 rad, the rotation per reﬂection must be smaller than
10−5 rad.
If the other suppression mechanisms work
properly this constraint can be relaxed by a factor of
14 and still get a 3% measurement.

The atomic sample must be precisely held at the node
of the microwave magnetic ﬁeld. The maximum displace-
10−11m to keep the 3% mea-
ment we can tolerate is 3
surement.

×

C. Calibration errors and extraction of nuclear
physics

Once we isolate the PNC signal (Eq. 16) it is nece-
sary to extract the constants of the interaction from it.
The uncertainty in the Raman amplitude and interac-
tion time are negligible, then from the measurement we
get directly AE1/¯h. The amplitude is the product of the
microwave electric ﬁeld and the matrix element. The mi-
crowave electric ﬁeld has to be known to 3%. The electric
ﬁeld can be measured by tilting the magnetic ﬁeld and
inducing an M1 transition. The wave functions used on
the matrix element have to be also known to the same
accuracy to extract κnsd. The eﬀective constant of the
anapole moment κa can be obtained after subtracting the
other two contributions to κnsd (Eq. 4). As explained
before, the anapole moment of the even-neutron isotopes
comes only from the unpaired proton, while the odd-
neutron isotopes contain contributions from the unpaired
proton and neutron. A measurement of the anapole mo-
ment to better than 10% will give an initial separation of
both contributions. The eﬀective constant of the anapole
moment is related to the weak meson-nucleon couplings,
and the measurement will further constrain their values
[19]. Furthermore, the constraints obtained with the odd
and even neutron isotopes are almost orthogonal on the

10

meson-nucleon coupling space [4]. Extraction and under-
standing of the nuclear parameters will require an equiv-
alent eﬀort from theorists to improve their calculations
of both the atomic and nuclear physics involved.

D. Other sources of ﬂuctuations

Transitions to other levels are generated by the mi-
crowave magnetic ﬁeld. These are transitions of the
type ∆m = 0 but they are small because they are non-
resonant at the magnetic ﬁeld we will be working (de-
tuning
0.4 GHz). Nevertheless, these transitions must
still be taken into account in a detailed analysis of the
data.

∼

The presence of stray electric ﬁelds produces Stark in-
duced transitions that mimic the PNC signal. A stray
electric ﬁeld of a magnitude of 13 V/cm in the z direc-
tion will generate a transition amplitude equal to the
parity violating signal. Stray ﬁelds large enough to be a
problem are unlikely to occur and can be ignored [27].

Gradients can also induce higher order multipole tran-
sitions such as an E2 transition or an even higher transi-
tion. Fortunately, these higher order transition between
the two hyperﬁne ground levels are strongly suppressed.
Table III summarize the results of the above analysis of
systematic eﬀects.

The anapole moment provides a unique probe of weak
hadronic interactions.
In particular it is sensitive to
weak long range meson exchange interactions, and con-
sequently allows a measurement of weak neutral currents
in the nucleus. This is not the case in high energy ex-
periments where the weak contribution must be sepa-
rated from the strong and electromagnetic contributions
which are much larger. We have presented the analysis
of a measurement strategy of the nuclear spin dependent
part of the PNC interaction, dominated by the anapole
moment. While the proposed measurement method can
be extended to other alkali atoms, a series of measure-
ments in a chain of francium isotopes will allow the sep-
aration of the proton and neutron contributions to the
anapole moment. The production and trapping of suﬃ-
cient amounts of francium is necessary to obtain a pre-
cise measurement. The contributions from protons and
neutrons will permit stronger orthogonal constraints on
meson-nucleon couplings.

TABLE I. Parameters of the ﬁve relevant francium iso-
topes. This includes spin, hyperﬁne splitting (Hfs) of the
7s1/2 state [37,38], Zeeman sublevels m2, m2, static magnetic
ﬁeld B0 at the minimum hyperﬁne separation, and corre-
sponding hyperﬁne separation νm at that magnetic ﬁeld.

TABLE II. Phase (P = A/|A|) of the relevant transition
amplitudes for the initial state F1=4, m1 and ﬁnal state
F2=5, m2 and polarized along the speciﬁed axis. For this
table all the ﬁelds have the same phase (equal to 0). PRx rep-
resents the Raman transition with one vector along the z axis
and the other along the y axis such that their cross product
points along the x axis. β represents the static magnetic ﬁeld
reversal together with a sign change on the Zeeman sublevel
m.

The quantum electrodynamic theory of the nuclear recoil eﬀect in atoms to all orders in αZ
and to ﬁrst order in m/M is considered. The complete αZ-dependence formulas for the relativistic
recoil corrections to the atomic energy levels are derived in a simple way. The results of numerical
calculations of the recoil eﬀect to all orders in αZ are presented for hydrogenlike and lithiumlike
atoms. These results are compared with analytical results obtained to lowest orders in αZ. It is
shown that even for hydrogen the numerical calculations to all orders in αZ provide most precise
theoretical predictions for the relativistic recoil correction of ﬁrst order in m/M .

I. INTRODUCTION

In the non-relativistic quantum mechanics the nuclear recoil eﬀect for a hydrogenlike atom is easily taken into
account by using the reduced mass µ = mM/(m + M ) instead of the electron mass m (M is the nuclear mass). It
means that to account for the nuclear recoil eﬀect to ﬁrst order in m/M we must simply replace the binding energy
E by E(1 − m/M ).
atom is described by the Dirac equation (¯h = c = 1)

Let us consider now a relativistic hydrogenlike atom. In the inﬁnite nucleus mass approximation a hydrogenlike

where VC is the Coulomb potential of the nucleus. For the point-nucleus case, analytical solution of this equation
yields the well known formula for the energy of a bound state:

(−iα · ∇ + βm + VC (x))ψ(x) = εψ(x) ,

εnj =

,

(1.2)

where n is the principal quantum number and j is the total angular momentum of the electron. The main problem
we will discuss in this paper is the following: what is the recoil correction to this formula?

It is known that to the lowest order in αZ the relativistic recoil correction to the energy levels can be derived
from the Breit equation. Such a derivation was made by Breit and Brown in 1948 [1] (see also [2]). They found
that the relativistic recoil correction to the lowest order in αZ consists of two terms. The ﬁrst term reduces the ﬁne
structure splitting by the factor (1 − m/M ). The second term does not aﬀect the ﬁne structure splitting and is equal
to −(αZ)4m2/(8M n4). Calculations of the recoil eﬀect to higher orders in αZ demand using QED beyond the Breit
approximation. In quantum electrodynamics a two-body system is generally treated by the Bethe-Salpeter method
[3] or by one of versions of the quasipotential method proposed ﬁrst by Logunov and Tavkhelidze [4]. In Ref. [5]
(see also [6]), using the Bethe-Salpeter equation, Salpeter calculated the recoil correction of order (αZ)5m2/M to the
energy levels of a hydrogenlike atom. This correction gives a contribution of 359 kHz to the 2s - 2p1/2 splitting in
hydrogen. The current uncertainties of the Lamb and isotopic shift measurements are much smaller than this value
(see, e.g., [7]) and, therefore, calculations of the recoil corrections of higher orders in αZ are required. In addition, for
the last decade a great progress was made in high precision measurements of the Lamb shifts in high-Z few-electron
ions [8–10].
In these systems, the parameter αZ is not small and, therefore, calculations of the relativistic recoil
corrections to all orders in αZ are needed.

II. RELATIVISTIC FORMULA FOR THE RECOIL CORRECTION

First attempts to derive formulas for the relativistic recoil corrections to all orders in αZ were undertaken in [11,12].
As a result of these attempts, only a part of the desired expressions was found in [12] (see Ref. [13] for details). The
complete αZ-dependence formula for the relativistic recoil eﬀect in the case of a hydrogenlike atom was derived in [14].

1

The derivation of [14] was based on using a quasipotential equation in which the heavy particle is put on the mass
shell [15,16]. According to [14], the relativistic recoil correction to the energy of a state a is the sum of a lower-order
term ∆EL and a higher-order term ∆EH:

∆E = ∆EL + ∆EH ,

∆EL =

∆EH =

Here |ai is the unperturbed state of the Dirac electron in the Coulomb ﬁeld VC(r) = −αZ/r, p = −i∇ is the
momentum operator, G(ω) = [ω − H(1 − i0)]−1 is the relativistic Coulomb-Green function, H = α · p + βm + VC ,
αl (l = 1, 2, 3) are the Dirac matrices, εa is the unperturbed Dirac-Coulomb energy,

Dlm(ω) is the transverse part of the photon propagator in the Coulomb gauge. In the coordinate representation it is

Dm(ω) = −4παZαlDlm(ω) ,

The scalar product is implicit in the equation (2.3). In Refs. [17,18], the formulas (2.1)-(2.3) were rederived by other
methods and in [17] it was noticed that ∆E can be written in the following compact form:

∆E =

i

2πM Z ∞

dω ha|[p − D(ω)]G(ω + εa)[p − D(ω)]|ai .

(2.6)

However, the representation (2.1)-(2.3) is more convenient for practical calculations.

The term ∆EL can easily be calculated by using the virial relations for the Dirac equation [19,20]. Such a calculation

gives [14]

∆EL =

m2 − ε2

a

2M

.

(2.7)

This simple formula contains all the recoil corrections within the (αZ)4m2/M approximation. The term ∆EH taken
to the lowest order in αZ gives the Salpeter correction [5]. Evaluation of this term to all orders in αZ will be discussed
below.

The complete αZ-dependence formulas for the nuclear recoil corrections in high Z few-electron atoms were derived
in Ref. [21]. As it follows from these formulas, within the (αZ)4m2/M approximation the nuclear recoil corrections
can be obtained by averaging the operator

(2.8)

with the Dirac wave functions. This operator can also be used for relativistic calculations of the nuclear recoil eﬀect
in neutral atoms. An independent derivation of this operator was done in [22]. The operator (2.8) was employed in
[23] to calculate the (αZ)4m2/M corrections to the energy levels of two- and three-electron multicharged ions.

III. SIMPLE APPROACH TO THE RECOIL EFFECT IN ATOMS

As was shown in [13], to include the relativistic recoil corrections in calculations of the energy levels, we must add
to the standard Hamiltonian of the electron-positron ﬁeld interacting with the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld and
with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus VC, taken in the Coulomb gauge, the following term

HM =

1

2M Z dxψ†(x)(−i∇x)ψ(x)Z dyψ†(y)(−i∇y)ψ(y)
M Z dxψ†(x)(−i∇x)ψ(x)A(0) +
−

A2(0) .

eZ

(3.1)

This operator acts only on the electron-positron and electromagnetic ﬁeld variables. The normal ordered form of HM
taken in the interaction representation must be added to the interaction Hamiltonian. It gives additional elements
to the Feynman rules for the Green function. In the Furry picture, in addition to the standard Feynman rules in the
energy representation (see [24,13]), the following verteces and lines appear (we assume that the Coulomb gauge is
used)

Let as apply this formalism to the case of a single level a in a one-electron atom. To ﬁnd the Coulomb nuclear
recoil correction we have to calculate the contribution of the diagram shown in Fig. 1. A simple calculation of this
diagram yields (see Ref. [13] for details)

(3.5)

This exactly coincides with formula (2.6).

Consider now a high-Z two-electron atom. For simplicity, we will assume that the unperturbed wave function is a

one-determinant function

u(x1, x2) =

1

√2XP

(−1)P ψP a(x1)ψP b(x2) .

(3.6)

The nuclear recoil correction is the sum of the one-electron and two-electron contributions. The one-electron contri-
bution is the sum of the expressions (3.5) for the a and b states. The two-electron contributions are deﬁned by the
diagrams shown in Figs. 4-6. A simple calculation of these diagrams yields

∆E(int) =

(3.7)

The formula (3.7) was ﬁrst derived by the quasipotential method in [21].

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

A. Hydrogenlike atoms

According to equations (2.1)-(2.3) the recoil correction is the sum of the low-order and higher-order terms. The
low-order term ∆EL is given by equation (2.7). The higher order term ∆EH was calculated to all orders in αZ in
[25–27]. The results of these calculations expressed in terms of the function P (αZ) deﬁned as

Comparing the function P (αZ) from Table 1 with the lowest order contributions (4.2)-(4.4) shows that for high Z the
complete αZ-dependence results diﬀer considerably from Salpeter’s ones.

In the case of hydrogen, the diﬀerence ∆P = P − PS amounts to -0.01616(3), -0.01617(5), and 0.00772 for the 1s,
2s, and 2p1/2 states, respectively. Table 2 displays the relativistic recoil corrections, beyond the Salpeter ones, to the
hydrogen energy levels. These values include also the corresponding correction from the low-order term (2.7) which
is calculated by

(4.6)

The results of Refs. [25,27] which are exact in αZ are compared with the related corrections obtained to the lowest
order in αZ. In [28,29] it was found that the (αZ)6 log (αZ)m2/M corrections cancel each other. The (αZ)6m2/M
correction was derived in [18] for s-states and in [30] for p-states. The (αZ)7log2(αZ)m2/M correction was recently
evaluated in Refs. [31,32]. The uncertainty of the calculation based on the expansion in αZ is deﬁned by uncalculated
terms of order (αZ)7m2/M and is expected to be about 1 kHz for the 1s state. It follows that the results of the
complete αZ-dependence calculations are in a good agreement with the results obtained to lowest orders in αZ but
are of much higher accuracy.

As it follows from Ref. [13], the formulas (2.1)- (2.3) will incorporate partially the nuclear size corrections to the
recoil eﬀect if VC(r) is taken to be the potential of an extended nucleus. In particular, this replacement allows one to
account for the nuclear size corrections to the Coulomb part of the recoil eﬀect. In Ref. [33], where the calculations of
the recoil eﬀect for extended nuclei were performed, it was found that, in the case of hydrogen, the leading relativistic
nuclear size correction to the Coulomb low-order part is comparable with the total value of the (αZ)6m2/M correction
but is cancelled by the nuclear size correction to the Coulomb higher-order part.

One of the main goals of the calculations of Refs. [25,26,33] was to evaluate the nuclear recoil correction for highly
charged ions. In the case of the ground state of hydrogenlike uranium these calculations yield -0.51 eV for the point
nucleus case [25] and -0.46 eV for the extended nucleus case [33]. This correction is big enough to be included in
the current theoretical prediction for the 1s Lamb shift in hydrogenlike uranium [34] but is small compared with the
present experimental uncertainty which amounts to 13 eV [10]. However, a much higher precision was obtained in
experiments with heavy lithiumlike ions [8,9]. In this connection in Refs. [25,26] the nuclear recoil corrections for
lithiumlike ions were calculated as well.

B. Lithiumlike ions

In lithiumlike ions, in addition to the one-electron contributions, we must evaluate the two-electron contributions.
In the case of one electron over the (1s)2 shell the total two-electron contribution to the zeroth order in 1/Z is given
by the expression

∆Eint = −

1

M Xεn=ε1s

ha|p − D(εa − εn)|nihn|p − D(εa − εn)|ai ,

(4.7)

where D is deﬁned by equation (2.4). Calculation of this term causes no problem [25,26]. For the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2
states, the results of this calculation expressed in terms of the function Q(αZ) deﬁned by

∆Eint = −

are presented in Table 3. For the s-states the two-electron contribution is equal zero. To the lowest orders in αZ the
function Q(αZ) is given by [23]

(4.9)

(4.10)

The expressions (4.9)-(4.10) serve as a good approximation for the Q(αZ) function even for very high Z.

For low Z, in addition to the corrections considered here, the Coulomb interelectronic interaction eﬀect on the non-
relativistic nuclear recoil correction must be taken into account. It contributes on the level of order (1/Z)(αZ)2m2/M .
To date, the highest precision in experiments with heavy ions was obtained for the 2p3/2−2s transition in lithiumlike
bismuth [9]. The transition energy measured in this experiment amounts to (2788.14±0.04) eV. In [8] the energy of the
2p1/2 − 2s transition in lithiumlike uranium was measured to be (280.59± 0.10) eV. In both cases the recoil correction
amounts to -0.07 eV and, therefore, is comparable with the experimental uncertainty. At present, the uncertainty
of the theoretical predictions for these transition energies is deﬁned by uncalculated contributions of second order in
α (see Refs. [34,35]). When calculations of these contributions are completed, it will be possible to probe the recoil
eﬀect in high-Z few-electron systems. This will provide a unique possibility for testing the quantum electrodynamics
in the region of strong coupling (αZ ∼ 1) beyond the external ﬁeld approximation since in calculations of all other
QED corrections in heavy ions the nucleus is considered only as a stationary source of the classical electromagnetic
ﬁeld.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper the relativistic theory of the recoil eﬀect in atoms is considered. It is shown that the complete αZ-
dependence calculation of the recoil correction provides the highest precision even in the case of hydrogen. The recoil
corrections to the energy levels of highly charged ions contribute on the level of the present experimental accuracy. It
provides good perspectives for testing the quantum electrodynamics in the region of strong coupling (αZ ∼ 1) beyond
the external ﬁeld approximation.

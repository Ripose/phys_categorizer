Collective Modes in a Dilute Bose-Fermi Mixture

Abstract

We here study the collective excitations of a dilute spin-polarized Bose-Fermi
mixture at zero temperature, considering in particular the features arising
from the interaction between the two species. We show that a propagating
zero-sound mode is possible for the fermions even when they do not interact
among themselves.

PACS numbers: 03.75.Fi, 67.60.-g, 67.55.Jd

Recent experimental progress in atomically trapped gases has led to a resurgence of
interest in quantum ﬂuids. A particular notable feature is the number of systems available,
ranging from single component bose gas in the original experiments where Bose-Einstein
Condensation (BEC) was ﬁrst achieved [1] to binary bose mixture [2], spinor condensate in
optical traps [3] and degenerate fermi gas [4,5]. Other systems have also received much recent
attention, in particular bose-fermi mixture. This last mentioned system occurs naturally if
‘sympathetic cooling’ is employed to reduce the kinetic energy of the fermions [6]. There
have already been several studies on the properties of this system. Questions addressed
include stability against phase separation [7,8] and collective excitations [8].

Although Bose-Fermi mixtures have been studied intensively in low temperature physics
in the context of 3He-4He mixtures [9], the atomically trapped gases oﬀer many additional
possibilities. By the choice of atoms, concentration of the various components, or the control
of interaction strength among them by external ﬁelds [10], one can unmask phenomena
previously unobservable. In this paper, we shall study one example of this by considering
the density oscillations of a bose-fermi mixture at low temperatures. We shall show that
a variety of novel phenomena can arise due to the coupling between the two components
for suitable parameters such as the ratio of the sound velocity of the bose gas to the fermi
velocity of the fermions. In particular, we shall show that it is possible to have a propagating
fermionic sound mode even in the absence of interaction among the fermions themselves.
Sound propagation has also been considered in ref [8] which however did not investigate the
eﬀects being studied here. We shall comment on this later.

We shall then consider a mixture of weakly interacting bose and fermi gases at zero
temperature. Both gases are assumed to be spin-polarized such as would be the case usually
in magnetic traps. For a dilute mixture, interaction among the bosons themselves and
between the bosons and fermions can be characterised by the scattering lengths abb and
abf in the s-wave channels. The fermions however do not interact among themselves since
they are spin-polarized. For simplicity we shall consider a uniform system. We shall further
assume that the gas is stable against phase-separation unless explicitly speciﬁed. We are
interested in the density waves of this system. As we shall see in general the modes may be
damped. Also since the density oscillations are likely to be studied by exciting the systems

with external potentials, we shall instead consider the density responses of the system under
external perturbing potentials. Collective modes of the system will show up as resonances
of these responses.

already left out terms that are small if q << pf . ω should be interpreted as having a small

and the responses thus
reduce to those of the pure bose and fermi gases. The corresponding formulas for χb and χf
were already given in eq (3) and eq (4) above. Before we proceed we shall recall the behavior
of these responses [11] and thus the collective modes. For simplicity we shall restrict ourselves
to small wavevectors, i.e. q << mbcb and pf , and without loss of generality ω > 0. The
bosonic response Imχb consists of a delta function at the excitation frequency ω = cbq. This
is due to the Bogoliubov mode which is purely propagating and undamped. For the fermions
however, there is no collective behavior. The absorptive part, Imχf , is ﬁnite for a whole
range of frequencies |ω| < vf q, known as the particle-hole continuum, arising from the many
possibilities of independent particle-hole excitations. Re χb is simple. It is given by g−1
bb at
ω = 0 and diverges to ±∞ as ω → cbq from below and above respectively. Reχf is given
by Nf at ω = 0. It decreases with increasing ω, changes sign at around ω ∼ 0.83vf q and
approaches −∞ as ω → vf q from both above and below. For ω > vf q, it remains negative
with its magnitude gradually approaching zero as ω → ∞.

Now we return to the bose-fermi mixture. The response δnb to an external potential V ext

It will be convenient to discuss the normalized response

˜χb = 1 in the static limit (ω = 0, q → 0) when there is no boson-fermion interaction
(gbf = 0).

Similiarly the fermionic response to an external potential acting on the fermions alone

is χf /(1 − g2

bf χbχf ). We shall discuss the behavior of the normalized quantity

˜χf ≡ N −1

f χf /(1 − g2

The normalization is chosen such that ˜χf = 1 in the static limit (ω = 0, q → 0) when there
is no boson-fermion interaction (gbf = 0).

bf χbχf ) and χf /(1 − g2

Before proceeding let us ﬁrst examine the responses at ω = 0. Stability requires that
the density responses χb/(1 − g2
bf χbχf ) be positive. Using the ω = 0
values of χb and χf above, these necessary conditions can be rewritten as gbb > 0 and
W ≡ Nf g2
bf /gbb < 1. Using the expression of Nf given earlier, the last inequality gives

earlier in [7] and [8] using slightly diﬀerent considerations. For bosons and fermions with
similar masses, we shall see shortly that W , a dimensionless parameter, serves as a useful
measure of the coupling between the bosons and fermions. If the bosons and fermions have

We shall discuss now the behavior of ˜χb and ˜χf in turn. The results are qualitatively

stability criterion (not only the linear stability condition above but also others derived in
[7])
Bosonic Response:
1. cb > vf : In this regime a propagating bosonic mode exists.
It can be easily veriﬁed
(e.g. graphically) that the mode frequency ω satisﬁes ω > cbq ( > vf q). The original
bosonic mode at ω = cbq is pushed upwards by the particle-hole ‘modes’ lying below. Some
examples are shown in Fig 1. This mode ‘repulsion’ is generally expected (c.f. coupled
harmonic oscillators).
It is however of interest to examine the microscopic nature of the
mode. At the mode frequency both χb and χf are negative. Thus, e.g., if gbf > 0, δnb and
δnf are of the same sign (see eqn (5)). The repulsion between the two species provides the
enhanced restoring force and oscillation frequency. This frequency shift is typically small
since usually W << 1.
2.
In this case the original bosonic mode lies inside the particle-hole contin-
uum of the fermions. The bosonic mode is thus Landau damped. For weak-coupling
the damping, thus the width of the response, can be estimated easily using eq(7) to be

(cbq). Examples are shown in Fig 2. There is a small shift of the mode
due to Reχf . The shift is towards higher frequency for u suﬃciently close to 1 but opposite
otherwise (Reχf < (>) 0 for ω/vf q > (<) 0.83. )
3. It is also of interest to study the bosonic mode for gbb < 0. This is in fact the case for the
6Li-7Li mixture investigated in ref [6], where the 7Li bosons have a negative scattering length
of ≈ −1.5nm. In this case the original bosonic system is unstable, and the Bogoliubov mode
has an imaginary frequency for suﬃciently small wavevector ( q < qc = 2mb|cb|/¯h, here
|cb| ≡ [|gbb|nb/mb]1/2). Since Nf g2
bf > 0 > gbb, the system is still unstable in the presence of
the fermions [7] (see also above). Of interest is the eﬀect of the fermions on the unstable
mode. Now for imaginary frequencies ω = iα, χf (q, iα) = Nf {1 − α
vf q ]} is
purely real and positive. χf decreases monotonically with α from χf = Nf at α = 0 to 0 as
α → ∞. It can be easily veriﬁed that there is a real solution for α to the dispersion relation
(c.f. eq (7) )

for suﬃciently small q (which includes the physically most relevant region where α attains
its maximum, i.e., the fastest growing instability). Thus the instability is not damped by
the particle-hole degree of freedom. In fact it can be veriﬁed easily that, for given q, α is
increased in the presence of the fermions. The system has become even more unstable. This
mode has δnb and δnf of opposite signs and corresponds to phase-separation as expected.
Fermionic Response:
1. cb > vf : In this case the fermionic response for 0 < ω < qvf is only slightly modiﬁed.

4

A new feature appears near ω ∼ cbq > vf q due to the coupling to the bosonic mode. An
example is as shown in Fig 3.
2. cb < vf : In this regime there are two important features of the fermionic response. If
u = cb
is suﬃciently close to 1, the imaginary part contains a sharp resonance at ω above
vf
the particle-hole continuum (Fig 4). There are two ways of understanding this mode. It can
be regarded as the continuation of the situation from cb > vf , i.e., it is due to the bosonic
mode which is itself slightly pushed up in frequency (c.f., Fig 3, note in particular the result
for u = 1). Alternatively, this mode can be considered as a zero-sound mode induced by
the bosons. The form for ˜χf in eq (9) is precisely that of an interacting fermi gas with
s-wave interaction gf f (and therefore necessary with more than one spin species, where the
response is given by χf /(1+gf f χf )) though with an eﬀective frequency dependent interaction
gf f → −g2
−1]. The
bosonic mode ω ∼ cbq for cb suﬃciently close to but below vf will thus induce a zero-sound
mode for the fermions just like an interaction among the fermions will. [12] Note however
there cannot be a real s-wave interaction among the fermions as they are of equal spins. Thus
this mode cannot be obtained by considering the eﬀective interaction among the fermions
as in ref [8].

The frequency of this propagating mode can be estimated by using the well-known disper-
sion relation of the zeroth sound ω/vf q ≈ 1+2e−2(1+
u)2 −1]
as suggested above. In order for the velocity of the mode to be say 1% above vf , then cb has
to be within around 7% of vf if W = 0.1. This estimate agrees with the numerical results
of Fig 4.

F0

The second interesting feature is that near the original bosonic mode frequency ω ∼ cbq,
there is a reduction in the absorptive part Im ˜χf (see Fig 6). In fact Im ˜χf → 0 as ω → cbq.
This, as well as the corresponding behavior of Re ˜χf , can be seen easily mathematically from
eq(5) due to the resonance nature of χb at this frequency. Physically this can be regarded as
due to mode-mode repulsion – the bosonic mode has pushed away the particle-hole ‘modes’
near ω ∼ cbq. This feature is present even for small coupling W . A larger W mainly increases
the width of this ‘transparent’ region. Thus in fact the frequency dependence of Re ˜χf is
actually stronger for smaller W ’s.

The energy absorption by the bose-fermi mixture from an external perturbation acting on
the fermions is thus substantially reduced for frequencies within this ‘transparent region’.
The width of this region can be estimated by using the observation that the fermionic
response is roughly reduced by the factor 1 + W (cbq)2
ω2−(cbq)2 for these frequencies. For the
fermionic response to be reduced to say 1/2 of its bare value, then |ω − cbq|/cbq < W/2.
This estimate agrees very roughly with the numerical results in Fig. 6.

In conclusion, I have investigated the collective modes of a Bose-Fermi mixture, and have

shown that there is important mode-mode coupling eﬀects, especially if vf ∼ cb.

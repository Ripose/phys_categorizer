Exploiting an approach similar to the R-matrix theory, the diﬀusion Monte Carlo method is em-
ployed to compute phase shifts and threshold cross sections for the elastic scattering of o-positronium
oﬀ light atoms. Results are obtained for Ps-H and Ps-He as representative cases of open and closed
shell targets. The method allows for an exact treatment of both correlation and exchange interac-
tions, and represents the most promising approach to deal with these eﬀects in more complicated
targets. In particular the Ps-He threshold cross section, computed in a many body framework for
the ﬁrst time, represents a standard by which past and future numerical and experimental estimates
can be judged.

PACS numbers:

Positronium (Ps) scattering oﬀ atomic and molecular targets has an overwhelming importance if an understanding
of the interaction mechanism between an overthermal Ps and a condensed matter environment is required [1]. For
instance, by means of elastic and inelastic cross sections, it may be possible to model energy transfers from Ps to the
surroundings or to describe the trapping of Ps in a free volume cavity. Despite its long history [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and
even in the case of light atoms, some quantitative aspects of the process still remain controversial and have recently
been addressed by a number of authors, both experimentally [8, 9, 10, 11] and theoretically [12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
From the computational point of view, the diﬃculties with which almost every method is faced are related to the
composite nature of both target and projectile. As a consequence, sensible results can be obtained only if correlation
and exchange eﬀects are properly treated. Moreover, an accurate description of the correlation eﬀects between the
target electrons and the positron in the Ps is important in computing ”pick oﬀ” annihilation rates. These eﬀects have
only recently been computed consistently for the case of positronium scattering oﬀ hydrogen and positronium atoms
[14, 17]. However, the full ab initio treatment (i.e. without the use of exchange or correlation model potentials) of
systems with more than two electrons still represents a formidable task. A glance to the recent literature on bound
systems containing a positron reveals a practically identical situation with only small numbers of electrons treated
explicitly. In this context, it has been shown by several authors [18, 19] that ﬂexible and accurate computational
techniques for small and medium size systems are provided by the family of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.
Among them, the diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) scheme represents the most powerful approach to study strongly
correlated systems thanks to its ability to sample a distribution proportional to the exact ground state wave function
of a given Hamiltonian. Where fermions are concerned, the antisymmetric nature of the wave function and its
consequent non-positiveness imply the introduction of a bias known as nodal error. For a given energy ǫ, the nodal
error ∆ǫ, which disappears if the nodal surfaces of the exact wave function are known, has a value which commonly
spans the range ∆ǫ/ǫ ∈ [10−5, 10−4] [20]. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the following results have been computed in the
DMC framework.

The application of QMC methods to scattering problems was independently proposed in the eighties in two pi-
oneering papers by two groups in the ﬁeld of nuclear physics [21, 22]. Their ideas have been recently applied to
the exciton-exciton scattering problem [17], thus providing the ﬁrst accurate calculation for the Ps-Ps system. This
approach, which closely resembles the original idea behind the R-matrix theory of Wigner [23], is brieﬂy summarized
in what follows for the case of an elastic collision. We deﬁne rAB = RA − RB as the relative position of the centers
of mass of A and B and p and µ as their relative momentum and reduced mass. The choice of a boundary rAB = R
under the condition Vint(R) ≪ p
2µ , allows one to approximate the wave function in the region rAB > R with the

ΨA(sA)ΨB(sB)

(cid:20)

Φl(rAB)
rAB

Ylm(cid:21)

A is the antisymmetrization operator, sA and sB the internal coordinates of the two separate fragments, ΨA and ΨB
their wave functions and Ylm and Φl the angular and radial functions describing the dynamics of the relative motion
of the two centers of mass.

The stationary form of Φl can be expressed as

Φl(rAB) = Il(prAB) + Sl(p)Ol(prAB)

2

where Il and Ol are Hankel functions, and Sl(p) is the scattering matrix. Here, p is connected to the total energy
by Etot = p
2µ + EA + EB where the computation of EA and EB, both being bound state energies, can be exactly
(R)
performed employing the DMC method. The condition Φ
Φ(R) = B and a corresponding value of p (i.e. Etot) are
enough to precisely state the value of Sl(p) in Eq.(2). The link between B and p is contained in the dynamics of the
interior region and therefore the computation of Etot in this region, under the same boundary condition on rAB = R
(i.e. imposing the continuity of the logarithmic derivative), provides the value of Sl. Eventually the scattering matrix
assumes the form

′

Hence, as long as the boundary condition is exactly controlled, all the relevant information is contained in the interior
region. In this subspace the wave function is normalizable and the energy, now parametrically dependent on R, can
be studied by means of one of the QMC techniques e.g. VMC, DMC or one of their variants. In order to easily fulﬁll
the above boundary condition in the DMC framework, one can choose the value of B to be inﬁnite. From a physical
point of view, this choice corresponds to add a rigid wall located at R along the distance between the target and
projectile centers of mass. Results will be presented in terms of phase shift δl(p) which is deﬁned by Sl = e2iδl and
can be expressed, starting from Eq.(3) and taking the B → ∞ limit, as

Sl(p) = −

l (pR) − BIl(pR)
I′
l(pR) − BOl(pR)
O′

tan δl(p) =

jl(pR)
nl(pR)

where jl and nl are respectively the spherical Bessel and Neumann functions.

Before going on we feel that it is worth stressing two important points. First, one has to satisfy the condition
V ≪ p
2µ , so an upper limit to the sphere radius R does not exist, while it cannot be chosen smaller than some
unfortunately not well speciﬁed threshold value. This imposes an upper limit to the relative kinetic energy. For Ps
scattering oﬀ neutral atoms, the interaction potential between the target and the projectile dies oﬀ as 1/r6
AB. This
short range potential allows the use of fairly small radii, a possibility not necessarily available for diﬀerent colliding
fragments. Secondly, since DMC samples the lowest energy state, it cannot be applied to scattering problems in
presence of a bound state.

Both these two points highlight the importance that studying excited states could have within this approach. The
possibility of raising the energy whilst keeping the surface constrain ﬁxed can, in principle, allow the study of every
system at any energy.

In this work, we applied the presented technique to the S-wave scattering of positronium oﬀ hydrogen and helium

built according to Young diagrams. In the Ps-H case, the exact internal wave function of both fragments is known
and O has the form

O = 1 + (−1)SP12

where S (0 or 1) is the spin momentum of the state and P12 the permutation operator between the two electrons. The
S = 0 space part of the wave function is everywhere positive, while the nodal surface for the S = 1 state is exactly
provided by the action of O. Under this condition the energy can be computed by DMC without any approximation.
The singlet state supports a bound state and, as said above, it is thus necessary to exploit an excited state technique.
Evidently, in order to get the required scattering information, the boundary condition at the surface for every state
must be controlled. As shown in Ref [17] the Correlation Function DMC method[24] with our choice of B accomplishes
automatically this requirement and it will therefore be used in the following. Detailed descriptions of this method
are out of the scope of the present work and can be extensively found in the literature [24, 25]. In this respect, we
limit ourselves to show the convergence for one calculation in Figure 1. All the simulations for the triplet state of
Ps-H were carried out using a time step of 0.01 hartree−1, 2000 walkers, and a total of 100 blocks of 10000 steps each.
Simulations for the singlet states were performed employing 2000 conﬁgurations, a time step of 0.01 hartree−1, and
a grand total of 10000 decorrelated Euclidean time evolutions. Low energy phase shifts for both S = 0 and S = 1
systems are shown in Figure 2. Scattering lengths are reported in Table I, together with three independent estimates
of the same quantities very recently calculated [12, 13, 14]. Whereas all of them agree in assigning the value for the
triplet state, there appears to be some controversy where the singlet state is concerned. Our results, which we believe
to be statistically exact, are very close to the values proposed in Ref [14] suggesting these could be safely considered as
a deﬁnitive estimate. This fact can be also taken as a strong proof of the reliability of the method we are employing,
as well as of the full-electron Stochastic Variational Method approach used in Ref [14].

With this premise, we now address the more debated problem of positronium scattering oﬀ helium. Before discussing
our computed quantities for this process, it is worth noting that the experimental measurements of the threshold value
of the cross section span almost an entire order of magnitude [8, 11]. The most recent theoretical estimates, obtained
by diﬀerent computational schemes, do not single out one of these as the correct one. The primary reason for this
failure is the small size of the cross section and a consequent large fractional error associated with any approximation.
To make a more direct comparison with experiments, Table II shows the most recently calculated and measured
threshold cross sections.

In the present study, the system is treated with a genuinely many-body technique and no physical approximation
have been made prior to the numerical simulation. The absolute freedom one has in choosing the analytical form of

which has a DMC energy statistically exact. Moreover, the only Young diagram compatible with the choice of an
helium atom in its ground state (S = 0) gives the following form for O:

O = (1 + P12)(1 − P13)

Simulations for this system were characterized by a time step of 0.005 hartree−1, 4000 walkers, and a total of 130
blocks of 25000 steps each. The numerical results for the phase shift are shown in Figure 3.

The value of the computed scattering length is 1.4046(6) bohr with a corresponding threshold cross section of

0. Comparison with numerical estimates and experimental results curiously shows this value to lie in a
’neutral’ zone, intermediate amongst the most recently proposed values (Table II). The nodal error, being the only

approximation introduced, deserves some comments. General considerations [26] show this bias on the phase shift to
be always negative and proportional to V −1/3 where V is the sphere volume. As a result of this, our scattering length
could be slightly lower than the exact one. More quantitatively, one can observe that in the interaction region the
employed function closely resembles the functional form used in bound state calculations on similar systems, for which
the nodal error roughly equals 10−5 hartree [19]. In the rest of the simulation volume the nodes of the trial wave
function are practically exact thanks to the validity of Eq. 1. For such a reason we expect a bias on the energy of the
same order of magnitude as the one in bound state calculations. If so, the nodal error would turn out to be smaller
than the statistical ﬂuctuations of our energy values, therefore warranting the statistical exactness of our results.

Among the numerous applications directly derivable from this method, we would like to emphasize that the possibil-
ity to sample the exact particle distributions in conﬁgurational space may allow one to obtain an eﬀective interaction
potential between Ps and a given atom or molecule. This potential, where all the physical eﬀects are correctly ac-
counted for, could be successively used to simulate Ps in condensed phases as molecular crystals and liquids. Moreover,
it could also help in deﬁning the preferential spatial location where the Ps positron would annihilate during a ”pick
oﬀ” annihilation event, so that the interplay between the theoretical and the experimental results may enhance the
diagnostic role played by Ps in condensed matter science. The DMC method is also suitable, as demonstrated in a
slightly diﬀerent context [27], for the computation of Zef f , and its formal extension to reactive processes (inelastic
are still excluded) has been known since the seminal work of Alhassid and Koonin [21].

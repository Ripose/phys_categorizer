Abstract. First introduced to explain superconduc-
tivity, anomalous quantum correlations between degen-
erate electrons with equal and opposite momentum, i.e.,
Cooper pairs, are due physically to an electron-electron
attraction mediated by the exchange of lattice-vibration-
generated phonons [1]. Cooper-like pairing between dif-
ferent chemical species was immediately suggested to ex-
plain the larger excitation energy for nuclei with even-
rather-than-odd numbers of nucleons [2], although un-
ambiguous evidence for proton-neutron pairs never man-
ifested. Here we report the prospect of Cooper pairing
between diﬀerent chemical species in a degenerate Fermi
atom-molecule mixture submerged in a Bose condensate
of atoms, a state enabled via two-color Raman photoasso-
ciation [3–7] of a Bose-Fermi mixture of degenerate atoms
[8–10]. Condensate density ﬂuctuations replace the vi-
brating ion lattice of the superconductor [11,12], and
phonon exchange induces atom-molecule Cooper pairing
at about a third of the Fermi temperature.

Photoassociation occurs when two atoms absorb a laser
photon [13], thereby jumping from the free two-atom con-
tinuum to a bound molecular state. Neutral-atom statis-
tics is determined by the number of neutrons in the nu-
cleus, which must odd for fermionic atoms and even for
bosonic atoms. Similarly, the sum of the total number of
neutrons in the nuclei of the constituent atoms is what
determines neutral-molecule statistics. Molecules formed
by association of two fermions will accordingly result in
a boson, whereas fermionic molecules are born from the
union of a boson and a fermion. Given a degenerate
Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms [8–10], two questions arise:
Will the atoms photoassociate cooperatively into stable
Fermi-degenerate molecules? If so, is it possible to enable
high-temperature Cooper pairing, not between atoms or
molecules, but between atoms and molecules?

To address these questions, we model a degenerate
Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms [8–10] coupled by heteronu-
clear photoassociation to electronically-excited degener-
ate Fermi molecules, which is favored over homonuclear
transitions for well resolved resonances [14]. The excited
molecules are themselves coupled by a second laser to
electronically stable molecules. Initial bosonic [fermionic]
atoms of mass m0 [m+] are denoted by the ﬁeld ψ0(r, t)
[ψ+(r, t)], and the excited [stable] fermionic molecules of
mass me = m0 + m+ [m− = me] by the ﬁeld ψe(r, t)
[ψ−(r, t)], with the boson (fermion) ﬁeld operator obey-
ing the appropriate commutation (anticommutation) re-
lations. The Hamiltonian density for this system is

and the intermediate (two-photon) laser detuning, basi-

lar state relative to the photodissociation threshold, is δ
(∆). Particle trapping is implicit to the chemical poten-
tial ¯hµσ (σ = 0, e,
). Low-energy (s-wave) collisions
are accounted for by the boson-boson (boson-fermion,
fermion-fermion) interaction strength λ00 = 2π¯ha00/m0

sions involving excited molecules are ignored.

Consider now the process of stimulated Raman adia-
batic passage (STIRAP) from atoms to stable molecules.
The key to STIRAP is counterintuitive pulse timing [15],
meaning that the two lasers are adjusted so that in the
beginning, when the population is in the initial state
(atoms), the strongest coupling is between the intermedi-
ate and ﬁnal states (excited and stable molecules), while
in the end, when eﬀectively everything is in the target
state, the coupling between the initial and excited states
is strongest. As the system passes from atoms to stable
molecules, the state with the larger population is always
weakly coupled to the electronically-excited molecular
state, and the subsequently low (ideally zero) population
reduces (eliminates) radiative losses.

While an atomic BEC will in principle respond as a
unit to form a molecular BEC [4–6], and photoassociation
of nondegenerate bosons and fermions was recently ob-
served [14], it is not clear what will become of a quantum
Bose-Fermi mixture [8–10], since Pauli blocking generally
prevents cooperation among degenerate fermions. Noth-
ing daunted, instead of complete conversion [15], which
would leave no fermionic atoms to form Cooper pairs with
molecules, we pursue fractional STIRAP [18]. Figure 1
shows that the fermions will indeed act cooperatively to
form stable degenerate-Fermi molecules, thereby mim-
icking behavior that was previously attributed to Bose
statistics [4–6]. Likewise statistical independence was
also found in atom optics four-wave mixing [16,17].

Once the transient STIRAP pulses have vanished, the
H0 in Eq. (1) with ∆ = δ = 0
system is described by

and σ = 0,

words, phonons spawned by BEC density ﬂuctuations are
exchanged between the fermions, altering their interac-
tion. Just like lattice vibrations that drive the attrac-
tion between degenerate electrons in superconductors,
BEC density ﬂuctuations lead to an attractive interac-
tion that can induce high-temperature Cooper pair for-
mation [11,12]. Adapting Ref. [11] to unequal masses,
eﬀective Fermi atom-molecule scattering length is

tive STIRAP converts roughly 18% of the initial Fermi
atoms into molecules (see Fig. 1), and that the fermions

If, by chance, the interaction between bosonic atoms
and fermionic molecules is repulsive (a0+ > 0), then
it will be necessary to introduce a Feshbach resonance

ρ− = 3.2

[21,22] in order to adjust the sign, and probably the mag-
nitude, of the atomic Bose-Fermi interactions. As long
as the required magnitude change is an order of magni-
tude or less, the system can be kept safely away from
resonance, and it is reasonable to expect weak interac-
tions and negligible losses; however, when the Bose-Fermi
interactions are repulsive, immiscibility can become an
issue. Speciﬁcally, a repulsive Fermi-Bose interaction
can cause the system to split into separate bosonic and
fermionic “phases”, in which case the BEC is no longer
available to inﬂuence atom-molecule interactions. From
an unequal-mass adaptation of Ref. [20], the Bose-Fermi
phases are expected to mix for ρ±
≈
1012 cm−3. If a switch to re-
2.8
pulsive Fermi-Bose atomic interactions is necessary, im-
miscibility is expected to be a marginal issue, one that
could be managed by going to lower densities.

For a signature, recall that Cooper pairing was sug-
gested to explain how nuclei with even numbers of nu-
cleons can have a larger excitation energy than nuclei
with odd numbers of nucleons [2]. Hence, consider the
atom-molecule system in the presence of very weak laser
light that is tuned onto one-photon resonance, so that
the system evolves, to lowest order, according to the
Hamiltonian density
H0 of Eq. (1) with δ = 0. The
Fermi temperature is then TF = ¯h(µ+ + µ− + ∆)/kB,
and Eq. (3) can be manipulated to read ωL2 −
ωL1 =
(µ+ + µ−), where the laser 1(2) photon en-
ωb + δǫb −
ergy is ¯hωL1(2), the molecular binding energy is ¯hωb, and
δǫb = 1.6 exp[
] kBTc/¯h. The presence of
anomalous atom-molecule correlations should therefore
blue shift the frequency of a dissociating photon by an
amount δǫ, in contrast to the otherwise red-shifted pho-
todissociation spectrum [23,24].

The remarkable possibility for realizing anomalous
correlations between atoms and molecules emphasizes
the intimate connection between quantum matter op-
tics and both condensed-matter [1] and nuclear [2] sys-
tems. Many issues remain to be investigated, however,
including the permanent dipole moment of the heteronu-
clear molecules, which could play a role under the right
conditions. Beyond an exotic superﬂuid state, if a two-
species mixture of atoms is loaded into an optical lat-
tice with one particle from each species per site [7]
then, analogous to the three-level atom [18], fractional
atom-molecule STIRAP could produce the ﬁnal state

to our pure-boson experience, lending conﬁdence to the

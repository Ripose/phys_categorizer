The electronic structure of the ground and some excited states of neutral atoms with

the nuclear charge numbers 1 ≤ Z ≤ 10 and their single positive ions are investigated by

means of our 2D mesh Hartree-Fock method for strong magnetic ﬁelds 0.5 ≤ γ ≤ 10000.

For γ = 10000 the ground state conﬁgurations of all the atoms and ions considered

are given by fully spin-polarized conﬁgurations of single-electron orbitals with magnetic

quantum numbers ranging from m = 0 to m = −N + 1 where N is the number of the

electrons. Focusing on the fully spin polarized situation we provide critical values of the

magnetic ﬁeld strength for which crossovers with respect to the spatial symmetries of the

ground state take place. It is found that the neutral atoms and singly charged positive

ions with 2 ≤ Z ≤ 5 have one fully spin-polarized ground state conﬁguration whereas

for 6 ≤ Z ≤ 10 one intermediate fully spin-polarized conﬁguration with an orbital of 2p0

type occurs.

I. INTRODUCTION

The behavior and properties of atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds is a subject which has attracted the
interest of many researchers. Partially this interest is motivated by the astrophysical discovery of strong
ﬁelds on white dwarfs and neutron stars [1–3]. On the other hand, the competition of the diamagnetic and
Coulomb interaction, characteristic for atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds, causes a rich variety of complex
properties which are of interest on their own.

Investigations on the electronic structure in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld appear to be quite com-
plicated due to the intricate geometry of these quantum problems. Most of the investigations in the
literature focus on the hydrogen atom (for a list of references see, for example, [4–7]). These studies
provided us with a detailed understanding of the electronic structure of the hydrogen atom in magnetic

ﬁelds of arbitrary strengths. As a result the absorption features of certain magnetic white dwarfs could
be explained and this allowed for a modeling of their atmospheres (see ref. [8] for a comprehensive review
of atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds and their astrophysical applications up to 1994 and ref. [9] for a more
recent review on atoms and molecules in external ﬁelds). On the other hand there are a number of mag-
netic white dwarfs whose spectra remain unexplained and cannot be interpreted in terms of magnetized
atomic hydrogen. Furthermore new magnetic objects are discovered (see, for example, Reimers et al [10]
in the course of the Hamburg ESO survey) whose spectra await to be explained. Very recently signiﬁcant
progress has been achieved with respect to the interpretation of the observed spectrum of the prominent

white dwarf GD229 which shows a rich spectrum ranging from the UV to the near IR. Extensive and
precise calculations on the helium atom provided data for many excited states in a broad range of ﬁeld
strengths [11]. The comparison of the stationary transitions of the atom with the positions of the absorp-

1

tion edges of the observed spectrum yielded strong evidence for the existence of helium in the atmosphere
of GD229 [12].

For atoms with several electrons there are two decisive factors which enrich the possible changes in
the electronic structure with varying ﬁeld strength compared to the one-electron system. First we have a
third competing interaction which is the electron-electron repulsion and second the diﬀerent electrons feel

very diﬀerent Coulomb forces, i.e. possess diﬀerent one particle energies, and consequently the regime
of the intermediate ﬁeld strengths appears to be the sum of the intermediate regimes for the separate
electrons.

There exist a number of investigations on two-electron atoms in the literature (see ref. [11] and references
therein). Focusing on systems with more than two electrons however the number of investigations is very
scarce [13–19]. Some of them use the adiabatic approximation in order to investigate the very high ﬁeld
regime. These works contain a number of important results on the properties and structure of several
multielectron atoms. Being very useful for high ﬁelds the adiabatic approach does hardly allow to describe

the electronic structure with decreasing ﬁeld strength: particularly the core electrons of multi-electron
atoms feel a strong nuclear attraction which can be dominated by the external ﬁeld only for very high ﬁeld
strengths. In view of this there is a need for further quantum mechanical investigations on multi-electron
atoms, particularly in the intermediate to high-ﬁeld regime.

The ground states of atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds have diﬀerent spatial and spin symmetries in
the diﬀerent regions of the ﬁeld strengths. We encounter, therefore, a series of changes i.e. crossovers
with respect to their symmetries with varying ﬁeld stength. The simplest case is the helium atom which
possesses two ground state conﬁgurations: the singlet zero- and low-ﬁeld ground state 1s2 and the fully
spin-polarized high-ﬁeld ground state 1s2p−1. In the Hartree-Fock approximation the transition point
between these conﬁgurations is given by the ﬁeld strength γ = 0.711. (If not indicated otherwise we use
in the following atomic units for all quantities. In particular, the magnetic ﬁeld γ = B/B0 is measured
in units B0 = ¯hc/ea2
0 = 2.3505·105T = 2.3505·109G.) In previous works we have investigated the series
of transitions of the ground state conﬁgurations for the complete range of ﬁeld strengths for the lithium
[18] and carbon [19] atoms as well as the ion Li+ [18]. The evolution and appearence of these crossovers
and the involved conﬁgurations become more and more intricate with increasing number of electrons of
the atom. Currently the most complicated atomic system with a completely known sequence of ground
state electronic conﬁgurations for the whole range of magnetic ﬁeld strengths is the neutral carbon atom

[19]. Its ground state experiences six crossovers involving seven diﬀerent electronic conﬁgurations which
belong to three groups of diﬀerent spin projections Sz = −1, −2, −3 onto the magnetic ﬁeld. This series
of ground state conﬁgurations was extracted from results of numerical calculations for more than twenty
electronic conﬁgurations selected via a detailed analysis on the basis of general energetical arguments.
The picture of these transitions is especially complicated at relatively weak and intermediate ﬁelds. Due
to this circumstance the comprehensive investigation of the structure of ground states of atoms is a
complex problem which has to be solved for each atom separately. On the other hand, the geometry of
the atomic wave functions is simpliﬁed for suﬃciently high magnetic ﬁelds: Beyond some critical ﬁeld
strength the global ground state is given by a fully spin polarized conﬁguration. This allows us to push

the current state of the art and to study the ground states of the full series of neutral atoms and singly
charged positive ions with Z ≤ 10, i.e. the sequence H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne, in the domain
of high magnetic ﬁelds. For the purpose of this investigation we deﬁne the high ﬁeld domain as the
one, where the ground state electronic conﬁgurations are fully spin polarized (Fully Spin Polarized (FSP)
regime). The latter fact supplies an additional advantage for calculations performed in the Hartree-Fock

2

approach, because our one-determinantal wave functions are eigenfunctions of the total spin operator S2.
Starting from the high-ﬁeld limit we will investigate the electronic structure and properties of the ground
states with decreasing ﬁeld strength until we reach the ﬁrst crossover to a partially spin polarized (PSP)
conﬁguration, i.e. we focus on the regime of ﬁeld strengths for which fully spin polarized conﬁgurations
represent the ground state.

II. METHOD

The numerical approach applied in the present work coincides with that of our previous investigations

[17–19]. Refs. [7,17,18,20] contain some more details of the mesh techniques. We solve the electronic
Schr¨odinger equation for the atoms in a magnetic ﬁeld under the assumption of an inﬁnitely heavy
nucleus (see below for comments on ﬁnite nuclear mass corrections) in the (unrestricted) Hartree-Fock
approximation. The solution is established in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) with the z-axis oriented
along the magnetic ﬁeld. We prescribe to each electron a deﬁnite value of the magnetic quantum number
mµ. Each one-electron wave function Ψµ depends on the variables φ and (ρ, z) as follows

Ψµ(ρ, φ, z) = (2π)−1/2e−imµφψµ(z, ρ)

(1)

where µ indicates the numbering of the electrons. The resulting partial diﬀerential equations for ψµ(z, ρ)
and the formulae for the Coulomb and exchange potentials have been presented in ref. [20].

The one-particle equations for the wave functions ψµ(z, ρ) are solved by means of the fully numerical
mesh method described in refs. [7,20]. The feature which distinguishes the present calculations from
those described in ref. [20] is the method for the calculation of the Coulomb and exchange integrals. In
the present work as well as in ref. [17–19] we obtain these potentials as solutions of the corresponding
Poisson equation.

Our mesh approach is ﬂexible enough to yield precise results for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths. Some
minor decrease of the precision appears in very strong magnetic ﬁelds. With respect to the electronic

conﬁgurations possessing high absolute values of magnetic quantum numbers of outer electrons some
minor computational problems arose also at lower ﬁeld strengths. Both these phenomena are due to a
big diﬀerence with respect to the binding energies ǫB µ of one electron wave functions belonging to the
same electronic conﬁguration

ǫB µ = (mµ + |mµ| + 2szµ + 1)γ/2 − ǫµ

(2)

where ǫµ is the one electron energy and szµ is the spin z-projection. The precision of our results depends,
of course, also on the number of the mesh nodes and can be improved in calculations with denser meshes.

Most of the present calculations are carried out on sequences of meshes with the maximal number of
nodes being 65 × 65.

III. RELEVANT PROPERTIES IN THE HIGH FIELD REGIME

In this section we provide some qualitative considerations on the problem of the ground states of multi-
electron atoms in the high ﬁeld limit. These considerations present a starting point for the combined
qualitative and numerical considerations given in the following section. At very high ﬁeld strengths the
nuclear attraction energies and HF potentials (which determine the motion along the z axis) are small

3

compared to the interaction energies with the magnetic ﬁeld (which determines the motion perpendicular
to the magnetic ﬁeld and is responsible for the Landau zonal structure of the spectrum). Thus in the limit
(γ → ∞), all the one-electron wave functions of the ground state belong to the lowest Landau zones, i.e.
mµ ≤ 0 for all the electrons, and the system must be fully spin-polarized, i.e. szµ = − 1
2 . For the Coulomb
central ﬁeld the one electron levels form quasi 1D Coulomb series with the binding energy EB = 1
for
2n2
z
nz > 0, whereas EB(γ → ∞) → ∞ for nz = 0, where nz is the number of nodal surfaces of the wave
function crossing the z axis. In the limit γ → ∞ the ground state wave function must be formed of the
tightly bound single-electron functions with nz = 0. The binding energies of these functions decrease as
|m| increases and, thus, the electrons must occupy orbitals with increasing |m| starting with m = 0.

In the language of the Hartree-Fock approximation the ground state wave function of an atom in the
high-ﬁeld limit is a fully spin-polarized set of single-electron orbitals with no nodal surfaces crossing the
z axis and with non-positive magnetic quantum numbers decreasing from m = 0 to m = −N + 1, where
N is the number of electrons. For the carbon atom, mentioned above, this Hartree-Fock conﬁguration
is 1s2p−13d−24f−35g−46h−5 with Sz = −3. For the sake of brevity we shall in the following refer to
these ground state conﬁgurations in the high-ﬁeld limit, i.e. the conﬁguration generated by the tightly
bound hydrogenic orbitals 1s, 2p−1, 3d−2, 4f−3, . . ., as |0N i. The states |0N i possess the complete spin
polarization Sz = −N/2. Decreasing the magnetic ﬁeld strength, we can encounter a series of crossovers
of the ground state conﬁguration associated with transitions of one or several electrons from orbitals
with the maximal values for |m| to other orbitals with a diﬀerent spatial geometry of the wave function
but the same spin polarization. This means the ﬁrst few crossovers can take place within the space of
fully spin polarized conﬁgurations. We shall refer to these conﬁgurations by mentioning, i.e. noting,
only the diﬀerence with respect to the state |0N i. This notation can, of course, also be extended to
non-fully spin polarized conﬁgurations. For instance the state 1s22p−13d−24f−35g−4 with Sz = −2 of
1s2(cid:11), since the default is the occupation of the hydrogenic
the carbon atom will be brieﬂy refered to as (cid:12)
(cid:12)
series 1s, 2p−1, 3d−2, . . . and only deviations from it are recorded by our notation.

In the following considerations we shall often refer to subsets of electronic states which possess diﬀerent
spin polarizations. As indicated above we will denote the set of electronic states with Sz = −N/2 as the
FSP subset. Along with the global ground state it is expedient to consider also what we call local ground
states which are the energetically lowest states with some deﬁnite degree of the spin polarization. For
the purpose of the present work we need to know the local ground state of the subset of electronic states
with Sz = −N/2 + 1 (which is the only partially spin polarized subset considered in this paper and which
is refered to as subset PSP) in the high-ﬁeld regime. This knowledge is necessary for the evaluation of
the point of the crossover between the FSP and PSP ground states, i.e.
for the determination of the
critical ﬁeld strengths at which the global ground state changes its spin polarization from Sz = −N/2 to
1s2(cid:11) state is the local ground state of the PSP subset of
Sz = −N/2 + 1. For suﬃciently high ﬁelds the (cid:12)
(cid:12)
electronic states.

IV. GROUND STATE ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS IN THE HIGH-FIELD REGIME

Let us start with the high ﬁeld limit and the state |0N i and subsequently consider possible ground
state crossovers which occur with decreasing magnetic ﬁeld strength. In the high-ﬁeld regime we have per
deﬁnition only crossovers due to changes of the spatial orbitals and no spin-ﬂip crossovers. According to
the goals of the present work we investigate the possible global ground state conﬁgurations belonging to

4

the subset FSP and determine the transition points to the subset PSP. Since the detailed study of the
latter subset of states for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths goes beyond the scope of the present work we consider
1s2(cid:11) state of this subset which is the local ground state of the subset PSP for suﬃciently
ﬁrst only the (cid:12)
(cid:12)
strong ﬁelds. Then we investigate the FSP ground states with decreasing ﬁeld strength until we reach
1s2(cid:11). Subsequently we need to consider other
the point of crossover with the energy of the conﬁguration (cid:12)
(cid:12)
electronic conﬁgurations of the PSP set in order to determine the complete picture of the energy levels
as a function of the ﬁeld strength near the spin-ﬂip crossover and, possibly, to correct the position of this
1s2(cid:11) is not the lowest one of the subset PSP at the spin-ﬂip
point (the latter is necessary if the state (cid:12)
(cid:12)
point).

Let us consider the ground state transitions within the subset FSP with decreasing ﬁeld strength.
The ﬁrst of these transitions occurs when the binding energy associated with the outermost orbital
(mN = −N + 1) becomes less than the binding energy of one of the orbitals with nz > 0. Due to
the circumstance, that all the orbitals with nz > 0 are not occupied in the high-ﬁeld ground state
conﬁguration, it is reasonable to expect the transition of the outermost electron to one of the orbitals
with m = 0 and either nz = 1 (i.e. 2p0 orbital) or nz = 2 (i.e. 2s orbital). The decision between
these two possibilities cannot be taken on the basis of qualitative arguments. For the hydrogen atom or
hydrogen-like ions in a magnetic ﬁeld the 2p0 orbital is more strongly bound than the 2s orbital for any
ﬁeld strength. On the other hand, owing to the electronic screening of the nuclear charge in multi-electron
atoms in ﬁeld-free space the 2s orbital tends to be more tightly bound than the 2p0 orbital. Thus, we
have two competing mechanisms and numerical calculations are required for the decision between the
possible |0N i − |2p0i and |0N i − |2si crossovers to a new local FSP ground state. Our calculations for the
|2si state presented below in table VI for neutral atoms and in table X for positive ions show that the

state |2si becomes more tightly bound than the |2p0i state only for rather weak ﬁeld strengths, where
this state cannot pretend to be the ground state of the corresponding atom or ion due to the presence
of more tightly bound non-fully spin polarized states. In result the ﬁrst intermediate ground state of
the subset FSP, i.e. the state beside the |0N i state which might be involved in the ﬁrst crossover of
the ground state with decreasing ﬁeld strength, is the |2p0i state. Calculations for the subset PSP (see
below) show indeed, that this state is the global ground state in a certain regime of ﬁeld strengths for the
neutral atoms with Z ≥ 6, i.e. C, N, O, F and Ne, as well as their positive ions C+, N+, O+, F+, Ne+.
For the atoms He, Li, Be and B (Z ≤ 5) as well as for the ions Li+, Be+ and B+ the state (cid:12)
1s2(cid:11) becomes
(cid:12)
more tightly bound than |0N i for ﬁelds stronger that those associated with the |0N i − |2p0i crossover and
the |2p0i never becomes the global ground state of these atoms and ions. Thus, both neutral atoms and
positive ions A+ with Z ≤ 5 have only one fully spin polarized ground state conﬁguration |0N i, which
represents the global ground state above some critical ﬁeld strength.

The question about a possible second intermediate fully spin polarized ground state occurring with
further decreasing ﬁeld strength arises for neutral atoms and positive ions with Z ≥ 6 which possess
the intermediate fully spin polarized ground state |2p0i. This state could be either a state, containing
an additional orbital with nz = 1 which would result in the |2p03d−1i conﬁguration, or a state with an
additional s-type orbital, i.e. |2s2p0i. The third possibility of the simultaneous transition of the electron
with the magnetic quantum number mN −1 = −N +2 to the 3d−1 orbital and the electron in the 2p0 orbital
to the 2s orbital, which gives the |2s3d−1i conﬁguration, can be excluded from the list of possible ground
state conﬁgurations without a numerical investigation. The reason herefore is that the 3d−1 orbital is
for any ﬁeld strength more weakly bound than the 2p0 orbital and thus the |2s2p0i conﬁguration possess
a lower energy than the |2s3d−1i conﬁguration for arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld strengths. When comparing

5

the conﬁgurations |2s2p0i and |2p03d−1i we can make use of what we have learned (see above) from
the competing |2p0i and |2si conﬁgurations for higher ﬁeld strengths: The 2s orbital is energetically
preferable at weak magnetic ﬁelds whereas the 3d−1 orbital yields energetically lower conﬁgurations in
the strong ﬁeld regime. Thus, we perform calculations for the |2p03d−1i conﬁguration for many ﬁeld
strengths and then perform at much fewer ﬁeld strengths calculations to check the energy of the |2s2p0i

conﬁguration in order to obtain the correct lowest energy and state of the set FSP.

The behavior of the energy levels described in the previous paragraph is illustrated in Figure 1. In
this ﬁgure the energy curves for four possible fully spin polarized electronic conﬁgurations and two
energy curves for the PSP subset of the neon (Z = 10) atom are presented. This ﬁgure shows, in
particular, the energy curve of the high ﬁeld ground state |0N i which intersects with the curve E|2p0i(γ)
at γ = 159.138. The latter energy remains the lowest in the FSP subset until the intersection of this curve
with E|2p03d−1i(γ) at γ = 40.537. This intersection occurs at higher ﬁeld strength than the intersection
of the curves E|2p0i(γ) and E|1s2i(γ) which is at γ = 38.060. On the other hand, the control calculations
for the state |2s2p0i, not presented in Figure 1, show that its total energy for γ = 38.060 is larger than
the energy E|2p03d−1i. According to the previous argumentation this means that the state |2s2p0i is not
the global ground state of the Ne atom for any magnetic ﬁeld strengths. Furthermore the state |2p03d−1i
is a candidate for becoming the global ground state of the neon atom in some bounded regime of the
ﬁeld strength. However, we have not yet performed (see below) a detailed investigation of the lowest
energy curves of the PSP subset which is essential to take a deﬁnite decision on the global ground state
conﬁgurations. For neutral atoms with 6 ≤ Z ≤ 9 and positive ions A+ with 6 ≤ Z ≤ 10 the energies
of the states |2p03d−1i and |2s2p0i at the points of intersections of the curves E|2p0i(γ) and E|1s2i(γ)
1s2(cid:11). This leads to the conjecture that no neutral
are higher than the energies of the states |2p0i and (cid:12)
(cid:12)
atoms with Z < 10 and positive ions with Z ≤ 10 can possess more than two diﬀerent fully spin polarized
ground state conﬁgurations in the complete range of ﬁeld strengths.

The above concludes our considerations of the fully spin polarized ground state conﬁgurations. To
prove or refute the above conjecture we have to address the question of the lower boundary of the fully
spin polarized domain, i.e. the lowest ﬁeld strength, at which a fully spin-polarized state represents the
ground state of the atom considered. It is evident that this boundary value of the ﬁeld strength is given
by the crossover from a fully spin polarized to a non-fully spin polarized ground state with decreasing
ﬁeld strength.

First of all we have to check if the state (cid:12)
(cid:12)

1s2(cid:11) has the lowest energy of all the states of subset PSP at
the point of intersection of the curve E|1s2i(γ) with the corresponding energy curve for the local ground
state conﬁguration of subset FSP. Following our considerations for the fully spin polarized case we can
conclude that calculations have to be performed ﬁrst of all for the states (cid:12)
(cid:12)

1s2(cid:11)
The numerical calculations show, that for atoms with Z ≤ 6 and ions with Z ≤ 7, the state (cid:12)
(cid:12)
becomes the ground state while lowering the spin polarization from the maximal absolute value Sz =
1s2(cid:11) is not the
−N/2 to Sz = −N/2 + 1. For heavier atoms and ions we ﬁrst remark that the state (cid:12)
(cid:12)
energetically lowest one in the PSP subset at magnetic ﬁelds at which its energy becomes equal to the
1s2(cid:11) at these
energy of the lowest FSP state. For these atoms and ions the state (cid:12)
(cid:12)
ﬁeld strengths. One can see this behavior for the neon atom in Figure 1. The second possible PSP local
1s22s(cid:11) (not presented in Figure 1) proves to be less tightly bound at these ﬁelds. These
ground state (cid:12)
(cid:12)
facts allow in the following a deﬁnite clariﬁcation of the picture of the global ground state conﬁguration
in the high ﬁeld regime. For atoms with Z ≥ 7 and positive ions with Z ≥ 8 the intersection points
1s22p0(cid:11) and the energetically lowest state in the FSP subspace have to be calculated.
between the state (cid:12)
(cid:12)

1s22p0(cid:11) lies lower than (cid:12)
(cid:12)

1s22p0(cid:11) and (cid:12)
(cid:12)

1s22s(cid:11).

1s2(cid:11) being the
In result, the spin-ﬂip crossover occurs at higher ﬁelds than this would be in the case of (cid:12)
(cid:12)
lowest state in the PSP subspace. In particular, the spin-ﬂip crossover for the neon atom is found to
be slightly higher than the point of the crossover |2p0i − |2p03d−1i, and, therefore, this atom has in the
framework of the Hartree-Fock approximation only two fully spin polarized conﬁgurations likewise other
neutral atoms and positive ions with 6 ≤ Z ≤ 10. The above conjecture is therefore refuted and the FSP
|2p03d−1i represents never the global ground state conﬁguration in the high ﬁeld regime for all neutral
atoms and positive ions with Z ≤ 10. It should be noted that the situation with the neon atom can
be regarded as a transient one due to closeness of the intersection |2p0i − |2p03d−1i to the intersection
1s22p0(cid:11). This means that we can expect the conﬁguration |2p03d−1i to be the global ground
|2p0i − (cid:12)
(cid:12)
state for the sodium atom (Z = 11). In addition an investigation of the neon atom carried out on a more
precise level than the Hartree-Fock method could also introduce some corrections to the picture described
above.

After obtaining the new spin ﬂip points for atoms with 7 ≤ Z ≤ 10 and ions with 8 ≤ Z ≤ 10 (which are
1s22p0(cid:11) states) one has to check them with respect to the next
transition points between the |2p0i and (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(in the order of decreasing ﬁeld strengths) possible PSP local ground state conﬁgurations. Analogously
1s22s2p0(cid:11). The numerical calculations
to the FSP subset these conﬁgurations are (cid:12)
(cid:12)
1s22p0(cid:11) conﬁguration at the spin ﬂip points
show, that their energies lie higher than the energy of the (cid:12)
(cid:12)
and they are therefore excluded from the list of the global ground states considered here.

1s22p03d−1(cid:11) and (cid:12)
(cid:12)

The ﬁnal picture of the crossovers of the global ground state conﬁgurations is presented in tables I
(for the neutral atoms) and II (for the positive ions A+). The corresponding values of the ﬁeld strengths
belonging to the point of crossover are underlined in these tables. The ﬁeld strengths for other closelying
crossovers which actually do not aﬀect the scenario of the changes of the global ground state are also

presented in these tables. In a graphical form these results are illustrated in Figures 2 (neutral atoms) and
3 (ions). Shown are the critical ﬁeld strengths belonging to the crossovers of selected states of the atoms
(ions) as functions of the nuclear charge. The ﬁlled symbols mark the crossovers of the energy levels
which correspond to the actual transitions of the ground state conﬁgurations, whereas the analogous
non-ﬁlled symbols correspond to magnetic ﬁeld strengths of the crossovers not associated with changes in
the ground state but excited states. One can see in these ﬁgures the dependencies of the ﬁeld strengths
for various types of crossovers on the charge of the nucleus. In particular, one can see many signiﬁcant
crossovers for Z = 10 lying very close from each other on the γ axis. This peculiarity in combination with
the behavior of the curve γ(Z) for the |2p0i − |2p03d−1i crossover allows one to expect the conﬁguration
|2p03d−1i to become a ground state conﬁguration for Z > 10.

Some summarizing remarks with respect to the global ground state conﬁgurations in the high ﬁeld
regime are in order. The atoms and positive ions with Z ≤ 5 have one ground state conﬁguration |0N i.
The atoms and ions with 6 ≤ Z ≤ 10 possess two high ﬁeld conﬁgurations. The C atom (Z = 6) plays an
1s2(cid:11)
exceptional role in the sense that it is the only atom which shows the ground state crossover |2p0i − (cid:12)
(cid:12)
involving the (cid:12)
(cid:12)

1s2(cid:11) state as a global ground state.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The tables III–X contain numerical values of the total energies of the neutral atoms and positive ions
obtained in our Hartree-Fock calculations. Tables III, IV, V and VI contain the energies of the neutral
1s2(cid:11) and |2si, respectively. The analogous results for the ions A+ are
atoms in the states |0N i, |2p0i, (cid:12)
(cid:12)

7

1s2(cid:11) and |2si). The
presented in tables VII, VIII, IX and X (the results are for the states |0N i, |2p0i, (cid:12)
(cid:12)
energies associated with the points of crossover for the global ground state both in neutral atoms and in
their singly positive ions are presented in table XI. These energy values provide us with the ionization
energies at the transition points. Being combined with the data of the previous tables they provide the
behavior of the ionization energies of the atoms and the total energies of the atoms and positive ions in

the complete high-ﬁeld region.

In Figure 4 we present the ionization energies of neutral atoms divided by the ionization energy of the
hydrogen atom as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength. All the curves for multi-electron atoms at
γ < 600 lie lower than the curve for hydrogen at the corresponding ﬁeld strengths. But for γ > 1500
the ionization energies of all atoms exceed the ionization energy for the hydrogen atom. Moreover,
with growing nuclear charge we observe a stronger increase of the ionization energy for stronger ﬁelds
accompanied by a shift of the starting point for the growth to the regime of stronger magnetic ﬁelds. This
strengthening of the binding of the multi-electron atoms at strong magnetic ﬁelds may be considered as

a hint for increasingly favorable conditions for the formation of the corresponding negative ions.

Figure 5 presents the ionization energies for the |0N i states for various ﬁeld strengths depending on
the nuclear charge Z, i.e.
for all atoms H, He,. . . , Ne. All the ﬁeld strengths presented in this ﬁgure
are above the ﬁrst crossover to another global ground state conﬁguration. Thus, the ionization energies
in this ﬁgure represent the diﬀerences between the energies of the high-ﬁeld ground states of the neutral
atoms and the corresponding singly charged positive ions. The curve for γ = 2000 can be considered as
the prototype example for the general properties of the dependencies EIon(Z). For small values of Z this
curve shows increasing values for EIon with increasing Z, then it has a maximum at Z = 5 and for Z > 5
it decreases with increasing Z. Analogous curves for lower ﬁeld strengths have their maxima at lower

values of Z. At γ = 1000 the ionization energy shows its maximal value at Z = 2, whereas the ionization
energies for γ = 500 and γ = 200 decrease monotonically with increasing Z. On the other hand, for
γ = 5000 and γ = 10000 we obtain a monotonically increasing behavior of the ionization energy for the
whole range 1 ≤ Z ≤ 10 of nuclear charges investigated in the present work. The behavior described
above results from a competition of two diﬀerent physical mechanisms which impact the binding energy
of the outermost electron in the high-ﬁeld ground state Hartree-Fock conﬁguration. The ﬁrst mechanism
is the lowering of the binding energy of the outermost electron with increasing absolute value of its
magnetic quantum number |m| provided that this electron feels a constant nuclear charge. The latter

assumption is a rough approximation to the case of relatively weak ﬁelds when the inner Z − 1 electrons
screen more or less eﬀectively the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus. The second and opposite tendency is
associated with the decrease of the eﬃciency of this screening in extremely strong magnetic ﬁelds due to
the fact that the geometry of the wave functions tends to be one-dimensional in these ﬁelds. In result the
eﬀect of increasing eﬀective nuclear charge exceeds the eﬀect of the growth of |m| with increasing Z for
the high-ﬁeld ground state conﬁgurations. Continuing this qualitative consideration we point out that
at each ﬁxed γ the inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld on the inner electrons become less and less signiﬁcant
as Z increases which is due to the dominance of the Coulomb attraction potential of the nucleus over
the magnetic ﬁeld interaction. This has to result in a signiﬁcant screening of the nuclear charge by these

electrons. In result the functions EIon(Z) for strong ﬁelds deﬁned on the whole interval 1 ≤ Z < +∞
have maxima at some values for Z and decrease for suﬃciently large values of Z.

Next we provide a comparison of the present results with adiabatic HF calculations which were carried
out for multi-electron atoms in refs. [13,16]. We compare our results on the Hartree-Fock electronic
structure of atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds with results obtained by Neuhauser et al [13] via a one-

8

dimensional adiabatic Hartree-Fock approximation. The calculations in this work were carried out for
the four ﬁeld strengths γ = 42.544, γ = 212.72, γ = 425.44 and γ = 2127.2. For Z ≤ 9 and all these ﬁeld
strengths and for Z = 10 at the three larger values of these ﬁelds the Hartree-Fock wave functions of the
ground states are reported to be fully spin polarized with no nodes crossing the z axis. This conclusion
diﬀers from our result for γ = 42.544. According to our calculations at γ = 42.544 the wave functions

without nodes crossing the z axis represent the ground states of atoms with Z ≤ 7 (i.e. H, He, Li, Be, B, C
and N) whereas for the atoms with 8 ≤ Z ≤ 10 (i.e. O, F and Ne) the wave functions of the ground states
are fully spin polarized with one nodal surface crossing the z axis. A numerical comparison of our results
with those of refs. [13,16] is shown in table XII. All our values lie lower than the values of these adiabatic
calculations. Since our total energies are upper bonds to the exact values we consider our HF results
as being closer to the exact values compared to the results of the adiabatic HF calculations. Therefore,
on the basis of our calculations combined with the results of [13,16] we can obtain an idea of the degree
of the applicability of the adiabatic approximation for multi-electron atoms for diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths

and nuclear charges. It is well known, that the precision of the adiabatic approximation decreases with
decreasing ﬁeld strength. The increase of the relative errors with decreasing ﬁeld strength is clearly visible
in the table. On the other hand, the relative errors of the adiabatic approximation possess the tendency
to increase with growing Z, which is manifested by the scaling transformation E(Z, γ) = Z 2E(1, γ/Z 2)
(e.g. [8,20]) well known for hydrogen-like ions. The behavior of the inner electrons is to some extent
similar to the behavior of the electrons in the corresponding hydrogen-like ions. Therefore their behavior
is to lowest order similar to the behavior of the electron in the hydrogen atom at magnetic ﬁeld strength
γ/Z 2 i.e. this behavior can be less accurately described by the adiabatic approximation at large Z values.
The absolute values of the errors in the total energy associated with the adiabatic approximation are in

many cases larger than the corresponding values of the ionization energies.

To conclude this section we discuss brieﬂy three issues, which could aﬀect the precision of the results
presented above. These issues are electron correlations, eﬀects due to the ﬁnite nuclear mass and rel-
ativistic corrections. For all these eﬀects we have to distinguish between their inﬂuence on the total
energy and on other quantities like the ionization energy and the ﬁeld strength for the crossover of the
energy levels. In most cases their inﬂuence on the latter values is much smaller due to the fact that they
involve diﬀerences of total energies for quantum states possessing a similar atomic core. Let us start by
addressing the problem of the electronic correlations which is the critical problem for the precision of

the Hartree-Fock calculations. The ﬁnal evaluation of the correlation eﬀects is possible only on the basis
of exact calculations going beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation. Therefore we can give here only
qualitative arguments based on the geometry of the wave function and on existing calculations for less
complicated systems. The dependence of the ratio of the correlation energy and the total binding energy
for the two ground state conﬁgurations of the helium atom has been investigated in ref. [21]. This ratio
for the 1s2 state decreases with growing γ from 1.4% at γ = 0 to about 0.6% at γ = 100. The same
ratio for the 1s2p−1 state (high ﬁeld ground state conﬁguration) increases with growing γ. It remains
however for all the ﬁeld strengths considered essentially smaller the values for the 1s2 state. This result
for the helium atom in strong magnetic ﬁelds allows us to speculate that for the ﬁeld strengths considered

here the correlation energy for atoms and positive ions heavier than helium atom does not exceed their
corresponding values without ﬁelds. Due to the similar geometry of the inner shells in the participating
electronic conﬁgurations we do not expect a major inﬂuence of the correlation eﬀects both on the ﬁeld
strengths of the crossovers of the ground state conﬁgurations within the subsets FSP or PSP and on the
ionization energies if the states of a neutral atom and the positive ion belong to the same subset. On

9

the other hand, the properties associated with conﬁgurations from diﬀerent subsets (for instance values
of the spin-ﬂip crossover ﬁeld strengths) can be aﬀected more strongly by correlation eﬀects.

Our second issue is the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite nuclear mass on the results presented above. A discussion
of this problem is provided in ref. [11] and references therein. Importantly there exists a well-deﬁned
procedure which tells us how to relate the energies for inﬁnite nuclear mass to those with a ﬁnite nuclear

mass. The corresponding equations are exact for hydrogen-like systems and provide the lowest order
mass corrections O (cid:0) m
M (cid:1) (m and M are the electron and total mass, respectively) for general atoms/ions.
Essentially they consist of a redeﬁnition of the energy scale (atomic units −→ reduced atomic units, due
to the introduction of the reduced mass) and an additional energy shift −(1/M0)γ(M + Sz) where M0 is
the nuclear mass. The ﬁrst eﬀect can simply be ’included’ in our results by taking the energies in reduced
a.u. instead of a.u. The mentioned shift can become relevant for high ﬁelds. However, it can easily be
included in the total energies presented here. We emphasize that it plays a minor role in the region of
the crossovers of the ground state conﬁgurations and decreases signiﬁcantly with increasing mass of the

atom (nucleus).

Relativistic calculations for the hydrogen atom and hydrogen-like ions were performed by Lind-
gren and Virtamo [22] and Chen and Goldman [23]. Our considerations are based on the work
by Chen and Goldman [23] which contains results for the 1s and 2p−1 states for a broad range of
Interpolating their results for the 1s state and using well known scaling
magnetic ﬁeld strengths.
transformations we can conclude that in the least favorable case of Z = 10 relativistic corrections
δE = (Erelativistic − Enon−relativistic)/ |Enon−relativistic| have to be of the order 4 · 10−4 for γ = 200
and 2 · 10−4 for γ = 104. The relativistic corrections for the 2p−1 state at relatively strong ﬁelds ap-
pear to be of the same order of magnitude or smaller than for the 1s state. Thus, making a reasonable

assumption that relativistic corrections for both inner and outer electrons are similar to those in the
hydrogen-like ions with a properly scaled nuclear charge we can evaluate |δE| ≤ 4 · 10−4 for Z = 10 and
lesser for lower Z values. The same relative correction can be expected also for the ionization energies
and energy values used for the determination of the crossovers of the electronic conﬁgurations.

VI. SUMMARY

In the present work we have applied our 2D Hartree-Fock method to the magnetized neutral atoms H,
He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F and Ne in the high ﬁeld regime which is characterized by fully spin-polarized
electronic shells. Additionally we have studied the crossover from fully spin polarized to partially spin
polarized global ground state conﬁgurations. The highest ﬁeld strength investigated was γ = 10000. Our
single-determinant Hartree-Fock approach supplies us with exact upper bounds for the total energy. A
comparison with adiabatic calculations in the literature shows the decrease of the precision of the latter

with growing Z.

The investigation of the geometry of the spatial part of the electronic wave function demonstrates that
in the high-ﬁeld limit this wave function is a composition of the lowest Landau orbitals with absolute
values of the magnetic quantum number growing from |m| = 0 up to |m| = N − 1, where N is the number
of the electrons: i.e. we have the series 1s, 2p−1, 3d−2,. . . For atoms with 2 ≤ Z ≤ 5 these states of type
1s2p−13d−2 . . . represent the complete set of the fully spin-polarized ground state conﬁgurations. Heavier
atoms 6 ≤ Z ≤ 10 have one intermediate ground state conﬁguration associated with the low-ﬁeld end of
the fully spin polarized region. This state contains one 2p0 type orbital (i.e. the orbital with a negative

10

z parity and |m| = 0) instead of the orbital with the positive z parity and the maximal value of |m|.
Extrapolating our data as a function of the nuclear charge Z we expect that a third fully spin polarized
ground state conﬁguration occurs ﬁrst for Z = 11, i.e.
the sodium atom. The third conﬁguration
is suggested to be the |2p03d−1i state. The critical ﬁeld strength which provides the crossover from
the partially spin polarized to the fully spin polarized regime depends sensitively on the changes of

the geometry of the wave functions. Indeed a number of diﬀerent conﬁgurations have been selected as
candidates for ground states in the crossover regime and only concrete calculations could provide us with
a ﬁnal decision on the energetically lowest state of the non-fully spin polarized electronic states. Generally
speaking all the spin-ﬂip crossovers mentioned above involve a pairing of the 1s electrons, i.e. the pair of
orbitals 1s2. The carbon atom (Z = 6) plays an exceptional role since it is the only neutral atom which
1s2(cid:11) as a global non-fully spin polarized ground
possesses two fully spin polarized conﬁgurations and the (cid:12)
(cid:12)
state conﬁguration. The spin-ﬂip crossover of the carbon atom preserves the total magnetic quantum
1s22p0(cid:11) conﬁguration as
number. All other atoms N, O, F and Ne (7 ≤ Z ≤ 10) possess instead the (cid:12)
(cid:12)
a non-fully spin polarized ground state for strong ﬁelds. We have determined the positions, i.e. ﬁeld
strengths, of the crossovers of the ground states. Beyond this total energies have been provided for many
ﬁeld strengths for several low-lying excited states.

An analogous investigation has been carried out for singly charged positive ions 2 ≤ Z ≤ 10. The
structure of the fully spin polarized ground state conﬁgurations for these ions is the following: The ions
with 3 ≤ Z ≤ 5 have one fully spin polarized ground state conﬁguration analogous to the high-ﬁeld
limit of the neutral atoms. For 6 ≤ Z ≤ 10, analogously to the neutral atoms, there exist two fully
spin polarized ground state conﬁgurations. Depending on the values of the nuclear charge number Z the
spin-ﬂip transitions associated with the lowering of the spin polarization with decreasing ﬁeld strength

lead also to wave functions of diﬀerent spatial symmetries. These data being combined with the data for
neutral atoms allow us to obtain the ionization energies of the atoms. The dependencies of the ionization
energies on the nuclear charge at ﬁxed ﬁeld strength generally exhibit maxima at certain values of Z.
The positions of these maxima shift to larger values of Z with increasing ﬁeld strength. We provide
some qualitative arguments explaining this behavior of EIon(Z). Finally we have given some remarks on
the interactions going beyond the present level of investigation, i.e. correlations and ﬁnite nuclear mass
eﬀects as well as relativistic corrections.

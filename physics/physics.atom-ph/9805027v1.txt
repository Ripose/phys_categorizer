The complex processes leading to the collisional popula-
tion of ultra-long-lived Rydberg states with very high angular
momentum can be explained surprisingly well using classical
mechanics. In this article, we explain the reason behind this
striking agreement between classical theory and experiment
by showing that the classical and quantum dynamics of Ry-
dberg electrons in weak, slowly varying external ﬁelds agree
beyond the mandates of Ehrenfest’s Theorem. In particular,
we show that the expectation values of angular momentum
and Runge-Lenz vectors in hydrogenic eigenstates obey ex-
actly the same perturbative equations of motion as the time
averages of the corresponding classical variables. By time
averaging the quantum dynamics over a Kepler period, we
extend this special quantum-classical equivalence to Rydberg
wave packets relatively well localized in energy. Finally, the
perturbative equations hold well also for external ﬁelds be-
yond the Inglis-Teller limit, and in the case of elliptic states,
which yield the appropriate quasi-classical initial conditions,
the matching with classical mechanics is complete.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the past few years new experimental techniques have
made possible the study of the dynamics of atoms or
molecules in which an electron is promoted to a very
high energy state, where it is only weakly bound to the
core [1]. These high energy states can be described by
approximately hydrogenic wave functions with very large
principal quantum numbers (n >
100) [2, 3]. The atoms
∼
(or molecules) in which a valence electron is promoted
to such high-n states are generically called “Rydberg”
atoms, because the energy levels of the excited electron
are well described by a Rydberg-like formula [2], and
their highly energetic electron is known as a Rydberg
electron.
In such systems the weakly bound Rydberg
electron resides mostly at an immense distance from the
atomic core, a distance so large that if Rydberg atoms
were solid, they would be just about visible to the naked
eye. Laboratory-scale external ﬁelds, and even weak
stray electric ﬁelds [4–8], become then comparable to the
atomic Coulomb ﬁeld sensed by the Rydberg electron, so
that the dynamics of the electron can be probed with ac-
curacy, and also fundamental dynamical properties such
as quantum manifestations of chaos [9–14], can be stud-

ied experimentally.

To a very good approximation, the dynamics of Ryd-
berg electrons is hydrogenic. More precisely, small devia-
tions from the purely hydrogenic eigenenergies are intro-
duced by the interaction between the far ﬂung electron
and the electronic cloud around the atomic or molecular
core. These deviations are quantiﬁed by the quantum
defect δℓ, which enters in the formula for the energy lev-
els as a correction to the principal quantum number n
[2, 15]. However, the quantum defect becomes rapidly
negligible as the angular momentum of the electron in-
creases. In fact, more complex atoms are often used as
experimental substitutes for hydrogen, since it is much
easier to excite their valence electron to a Rydberg state,
and yet the ﬁeld sensed by the Rydberg electron does
not diﬀer much from a pure Coulomb ﬁeld. Therefore
many recent investigations of Rydberg electrons in alkali
atoms have really probed the dynamics of quasi-classical
electrons in an essentially coulombic potential. These ac-
curate experimental results have lead to a renewed the-
oretical interest in the hydrogen atom in external ﬁelds
in the limit of large quantum numbers, [10, 16–19] which
has become one of the paradigmatic models for the study
of “quantum chaos” [9–14], and of quantum-classical cor-
respondence in general.

Since the degeneracy of a hydrogenic n-manifold grows
as n2, a fully quantum treatment of the dynamics of Ry-
dberg electrons poses formidable challenges even to the
most advanced computers. Therefore classical mechan-
ics is often the only practical way to study such sys-
tems, under the assumption that for large n’s classical
and quantum predictions should somehow converge. In-
terestingly, however, recent experimental and theoretical
work on electronic wave packets in hydrogenic systems
[20–45] have shown very clearly that the quantum me-
chanical properties of the Rydberg electron are essential
to the dynamics of the wave packet, even in the large-n
regime. For example, the observation of fractional re-
vivals can be explained only by the quantized spectrum
of the Hamiltonian [20–22, 25, 27–29] in spite of the very
large principal quantum numbers involved, which seems
to suggest that large quantum numbers are not suﬃcient
to ensure the accuracy of a purely classical description of
Rydberg dynamics.

On the other hand, classical mechanics yields surpris-
ingly accurate results for the problem of the hydrogen
atom in weak, slowly varying external ﬁelds; i.e., when

1

the classical electron still moves, to a good approxima-
tion, along a Kepler ellipse, and the semimajor axis of
the ellipse (or, equivalently, the Kepler energy of the elec-
tron) remains unchanged. In particular, recent classical,
perturbative calculations [46–49] have succeeded in ex-
plaining several diverse experimental results with aston-
ishing accuracy, ranging from the ultra-long lifetimes of
the molecular high-n states employed in zero-electron-
kinetic-energy (ZEKE) spectroscopy [5–7, 46, 47, 50–56],
to the intrashell transitions induced in alkali Rydberg
atoms by slow ion-Rydberg collisions [46, 47, 57–61]. The
same classical approach also explains the anomalous au-
toionization lifetimes of Rydberg electrons in circularly
polarized microwave ﬁelds [48, 62] and the dynamics and
stability of circular Rydberg states (i.e., states with max-
imum angular momentum) in weak, slowly rotating elec-
tric ﬁelds [4, 49]. Clearly, the success of the classical
treatment must stem from some special equivalence be-
tween classical and quantum predictions in the hydrogen
in fact, such equivalence
atom in weak external ﬁelds:
has been already simply observed (but not explained)
only in the limited case of states with initial zero angular
momentum [63, 64].

In this work we show that the accuracy of the classi-
cal results does indeed rest on a particularly direct con-
nection between classical and quantum predictions, and
demonstrate explicitly that in the perturbative limit the
expectation values of the quantum observables satisfy
exactly the same equations as the time averaged classi-
cal variables. We also investigate the conditions on the
ﬁelds for which the perturbative approach holds, and we
ﬁnd that classical mechanics seems to require more re-
laxed constraints on the external ﬁelds than quantum
mechanics, as the classical condition for the conserva-
tion of the Kepler energy -see below- is not equivalent to
the quantum condition for negligible inter-manifold mix-
ing. However, by studying in detail the contributions
to the dynamics which stem from n-mixing, we demon-
strate that the perturbative equations of motion for the
quantum expectation values remain accurate also under
the less restrictive classical conditions, as long as the dy-
namics is time averaged over a Kepler period. In fact,
the time averaged equations describe well the dynamics
of quantum expectation values also when the Rydberg
electron is initially excited in a superposition of hydro-
genic n-manifolds, i.e., its initial state is not a stationary
eigenstate of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, but a time
dependent wave packet. Interestingly, time averaging is
precisely the same procedure which leads to the classi-
cal perturbative equations, and therefore our result is an
explicit example of how the scrambling of the principal
quantum number (quantum decoherence) brings about a
more direct quantum-classical correspondence. Finally,
we show that for special superpositions of the eigen-
states of the bare Hamiltonian (that is, elliptic states
[29, 65, 66]) and in the limit of large principal quantum
numbers, the quantum expectation values also have the
appropriate quasi-classical initial conditions. Most im-

2

portantly, elliptic states are not merely theoretical con-
structs: they have been prepared in the laboratory and
some of their properties have already been studied exper-
imentally [8, 67–69].

Our ﬁndings are not merely an application of Ehren-
fest’s theorem [70]. Although Ehrenfest’s theorem relates
the time evolution of the quantum expectation values to
the classical equations of motion, it does not state that
quantum expectation values and classical variables obey
exactly the same equations. Such an identity holds only
for the harmonic oscillator and, albeit trivially, also for
the free particle and any linear potential. Because the
harmonic oscillator is often used as a textbook example,
it often leads to the incorrect impression that such exact
equivalence is of more general nature. In truth this corre-
spondence is a very special property of potentials which
are at most quadratic, because in general the expectation
value of the “force operator” f (ˆr) =
V (ˆr), which is
a function of quantum observables, is not equal to the
same function evaluated at the expectation values of the
observables; that is (in general):

In the very special case of the harmonic oscillator, for
example, the restoring force of the spring is simply pro-
portional to ˆx and the two sides of Eq. (1) are identical,
hence the exact correspondence between quantum and
classical evolution. Also, the perturbative treatment of
the Kepler problem borrows heavily from the methods of
celestial mechanics [71] and studies the dynamics of time
averages of the classical variables. Such an approach is
not the same as an expansion of the Hamiltonian around
an equilibrium point and up to quadratic terms in the po-
tential, which would make the system trivially equivalent
to a harmonic oscillator. Therefore, our work amounts
to an extension of Ehrenfest theorem, in a much stronger
form, for the important case of the hydrogen atom in
weak, slowly varying external ﬁelds.

This paper is organized as follows: in section II we de-
rive explicitly the equations of motion for the quantum
expectation values over states conﬁned within an hydro-
genic n-manifold, and show that they coincide with the
classical perturbative equations to ﬁrst order in the ﬁelds.
In section III we investigate the contributions to the dy-
namics due to the inter-manifold mixing: we show that
the same perturbative equations of motion remain accu-
rate even if the state is not initially conﬁned within a
speciﬁc n-manifold, as long as one considers the time av-
erage (over a Kepler period) of the dynamics. In section
IV we study the initial conditions for the quantum ex-
pectation values over diﬀerent quantum states and also
discuss a few physical implications of our results. Finally
in section V we draw some general conclusions.

II. CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM EQUATIONS

In atomic units (which we use throughout this paper)
the Hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom in crossed electric
and magnetic ﬁeld is:

H =

p2
2 −

1
r −

ωLLz + F x +

(x2 + y2) ,

(2)

ω2
L
2

where the electric ﬁeld is parallel to the x-axis and its
strength is F ; the magnetic ﬁeld is antiparallel to the
z-axis and ωL is the Larmor frequency of the magnetic
ﬁeld, which in atomic units is equal to half the strength of
the ﬁeld. For weak ﬁelds the diamagnetic term, which is
proportional to the square of the ﬁeld, can be neglected,
and the Hamiltonian becomes identical to the one for
a hydrogen atom in a weak electric ﬁeld rotating with
frequency ωL, in the noninertial frame which rotates with
the ﬁeld [17, 46–49].

The classical perturbative treatment of the hydrogen
atom in weak, external ﬁelds is based on the methods of
celestial mechanics, and one is interested in the secular
variation of the elements of the Kepler ellipse followed by
the classical electron [71]. While a Kepler ellipse can be
described by many equivalent sets of elements, the equa-
tions of motion are particularly simple if one chooses the
angular momentum and the Runge-Lenz vector. There-
fore, the dynamical variables of the classical problem are
the time averages over a Kepler period, and along a Ke-
pler ellipse (which is the classical solution to zeroth order
in the external ﬁelds), of the angular momentum L of the
electron, and its scaled Runge-Lenz vector a, which for
bound states is deﬁned as [72]:

The antisymmetrization of the cross product is not nec-
essary in classical mechanics, but is essential in quantum
mechanics to obtain a hermitian operator [73, 74]. To
ﬁrst order in the external ﬁelds the classical, time aver-
aged angular momentum and scaled Runge-Lenz vector
(which for the sake of a simpler notation we will still
indicate respectively as L and a) satisfy the following
equations of motion [46, 75–78]:

and ωL is the Larmor frequency vector:
it is directed
along the external magnetic ﬁeld and its magnitude is
equal to the Larmor frequency of the ﬁeld itself.

Eqs. (4) were derived originally by Born [75] and in
classical mechanics they remain accurate as long as the
two frequencies (Stark and Larmor) are much smaller
than the Kepler frequency ωK of the electron [46, 75–78]:

ωS , ωL

ωK =

≪

1
n3 .

In classical mechanics Eq. (6) means that the elements
of the Kepler orbit do not vary signiﬁcantly over a Kepler
period, so that the classical electron still moves, to a good
approximation, along a Kepler ellipse, and the Kepler
energy of the classical electron is conserved. In fact, the
classical angular momentum and the Runge-Lenz vector
obey two constraint equations [72]:

a = 0
L
L2 + a2 = n2 .

·

It is easy to see that both constraints are invariant under
the time evolution dictated by Eqs. (4), and also that
the second of Eqs. (7) implies the conservation of the
Kepler energy of the electron.

Instead, the quantum mechanical interpretation is that
the external ﬁelds remove the degeneracy of the n2 un-
perturbed states of the hydrogenic n-manifold, and the
conditions of Eq.
(6) mean that the energy diﬀerence
between two adjacent perturbed states is much smaller
than the separation between adjacent, unperturbed Ry-
dberg energy levels. However, this is not the usual con-
dition under which in quantum mechanics inter-n mixing
is negligible. For example, in the case of just an external
d.c. ﬁeld (the extension to include also a magnetic ﬁeld is
straightforward [79]) the energy separation between the
lowest and the highest Stark states for a ﬁxed principal
quantum number n is (to ﬁrst order in the ﬁeld) [80]:

∆E = 3n(n

1)F .

−

Therefore the approximate condition for level crossing of
the highest Stark state from a given n-manifold with the
lowest Stark level from the next n-manifold is given by
the Inglis-Teller limit [2]:

3n2F

1
n3 .

≈

Clearly, in the semiclassical limit the quantum condition
on the external ﬁelds for negligible n-mixing of Eq. (9) is
much stronger than the classical condition of Eq. (6). We
show below, however, that the perturbative treatment of
the dynamics of the quantum expectation values remains
accurate also in presence of some degree of n-mixing in-
duced by the external ﬁelds, as long as the dynamics is
time averaged over a Kepler period.

In this section we conﬁne our study to the dynamics of
the quantum expectation values of the angular momen-
tum and the scaled Runge-Lenz vector operators (that is,

eı) over superpositions of the hydrogen atom eigenfunc-
tions with a well deﬁned principal quantum number; i.e.,
over states
which are localized within an hydrogenic
n-manifold. More precisely, we show here that to ﬁrst or-
der in the external ﬁelds the quantum expectation values
obey exactly the same equations of motion as Eqs. (4).
In our demonstration we do not apply Pauli’s replace-
ment -see below- directly in the Hamiltonian [31, 73, 74,
81, 82], and that is precisely why in the next section we
will be able to extend our analysis to the dynamics of
Rydberg wave packets. Moreover, we will also be able to
show that the quantum analogs of Eqs. (4) remain accu-
rate under the classical conditions on the external ﬁelds
of Eq. (6).

To prove the special quantum-classical equivalence, we
will make use of the following identity, which holds within
an hydrogenic manifold and which we derive explicitly in
Appendix A:

where ˆrı and ˆp are components of the position and mo-
mentum operator respectively. In Eq. (10) and through-
out this paper p (and also its corresponding quantum
operator ˆp) indicates a component of the mechanical mo-
mentum of the electron, i.e., p = mv where v is the ve-
locity of the electron. It does not indicate the canonical
eA/c, where A
momentum of the electron
is the vector potential of the external ﬁeld.

 = mv

P

Indeed, armed with the result of Eq. 10 it is easy to
show that to ﬁrst order in the external ﬁelds the expecta-
tion values of the quantum observables satisfy the same
equations as the time averages (over a Kepler period) of
the classical variables.

The equations of motion of the quantum expectation
values are straightforward in the Heisenberg picture [70]:

and we now show that they are identical to Eqs. (4).

The classical equations (4) contain two terms, an elec-
tric term which is proportional to the Stark frequency
ωS, and which couples the angular momentum to the
scaled Runge-Lenz vector; and a magnetic term which
is proportional to the Larmor frequency ωL of the ﬁeld
(or to the rotation frequency of a slowly rotating electric
ﬁeld, in a noninertial frame rotating with the ﬁeld itself
[17, 46–49]). Both the scaled Runge-Lenz vector and the
angular momentum commute with the hydrogenic Hamil-
tonian (they are invariants of the pure Kepler problem)
[72]. Moreover, it is easy to see that the magnetic term of
the classical equations can be recovered by invoking the
vectorial properties of ˆa and ˆL, because of which their

commutators with the magnetic term in of the Hamilto-
nian (i.e.,

ωL ˆLz) obey the well known rule [70]:

where ˆVı stands for the ıth component of any vector op-

Therefore, we only need to investigate the commuta-

tors of ˆa and ˆL with the electric perturbation F ˆx.

which is the same as the right hand side of the corre-

This is not yet in the desired form. However, within

Pauli’s replacement is mathematically exact, however it
is a physically sound approximation only if certain con-
ditions on the external ﬁelds are satisﬁed, i.e., if the state
remains localized within an hydrogenic manifold, and we
discuss such conditions in detail in the following section.
However, lets’ assume for the moment that Eq. (20) is a
physically accurate approximation, and one has:

which is the same electric term as in the right hand side
of the corresponding classical equations of motion, and
our proof is complete.

Our derivation of the equations of motion of the quan-
tum expectation values is accurate only to ﬁrst order in
the ﬁelds because it relies heavily on the identity of Eq.
states; these
(10), which holds for the unperturbed
are eigenstates of the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian and
therefore are quantum solutions to zeroth order in the
ﬁelds. In fact, this is exactly in the same spirit as the
classical approach, where the right hand sides of Hamil-
ton equations are time averaged over a Kepler period
and, most importantly, along Kepler ellipses, which are
the classical solutions to zeroth order in the ﬁelds.

The same consideration can also be cast in the lan-
guage of operators, by observing that we have proven
Eq. (10) only for the time independent operators of the
Schr¨odinger picture, whereas in the right hand side of the
equations of motion one must more correctly use the time
dependent operators of the Heisenberg picture. However,
in a ﬁrst order approximation one may assume that the
time evolution of the operators in the Heisenberg picture
is dictated solely by the hydrogenic propagator, which
commutes with both ˆL and ˆa, so that one can legitimately
use the properties of those operators in the Schr¨odinger
picture.

Since Eq. (10) holds for all possible pairs of indexes

However, the most important feature of our proof is
that we have not applied Pauli’s replacement directly in

the Hamiltonian [31, 73, 74, 81, 82]. An early application
of Pauli’s replacement erases all information about the
precise conditions on the ﬁelds under which the perturba-
tive classical equations of motion constitute an accurate
description of the dynamics of the quantum expectation
values. Moreover, it also makes impossible to study the
corrections to the dynamics due to inter-manifold mixing
and therefore one could not extend Eqs. (4) to the case
of Rydberg wave packets. Instead, in the next section we
address in detail precisely these important issues.

III. INTER-MANIFOLD DYNAMICS AND
QUANTUM-CLASSICAL CORRESPONDENCE
IN RYDBERG WAVE PACKETS

In this section we study inter-manifold mixing and the
conditions on the external ﬁelds under which the clas-
sical perturbative equations of motion oﬀer an accurate
treatment of the dynamics of the quantum expectation
values. We will show that the same conditions as in clas-
sical mechanics hold in quantum mechanics too, provided
that the dynamics is time averaged over a Kepler period.
Most importantly, we will demonstrate that upon time

averaging Eqs.
wave packets.

For the sake of simplicity we restrict our analysis to the
pure Stark case, that is when there is no external mag-
netic ﬁeld; the extension to the more general case includ-
ing a weak magnetic ﬁeld is straightforward. Therefore,
in this section we assume a simpliﬁed Hamiltonian:

again the strength of the external electric ﬁeld.

Inter-manifold mixing is due to two main causes, de-
If the
pending on how the Rydberg state is prepared.
Rydberg electron is initially conﬁned within a hydrogenic
n-manifold, then n-mixing is induced by the applied ex-
ternal ﬁeld, and in that case the inter-manifold contri-
butions to the equations of motion are of second order
in the applied ﬁeld. Note that this is a very realistic
picture for slow ion-Rydberg collisions [46, 47, 57–61]. In
fact, ion-Rydberg collisions are actually gentle encoun-
ters at very large ion-Rydberg separation, which are ef-
fective because of the long-range nature of the coulomb
interaction, and are very accurately modeled by a time
dependent, weak external ﬁeld acting on the Rydberg
electron [46, 47]. Typically, the Rydberg state is pre-
pared in absence of external dc ﬁelds, and the weak ﬁeld
of the colliding ion is turned on adiabatically as the ion
slowly approaches the Rydberg atom. In such situation,
the analysis of inter-manifold mixing is equivalent to the
study of the second order corrections to the equations of
motion, and it allows one to determine for what precise
conditions on the external electric ﬁeld such corrections
are negligible.

If n′ = n one has [80]:

However, n-mixing can also be present at the outset,
either if the Rydberg state is prepared in presence of the
applied dc ﬁeld and the ﬁeld is strong enough to mix ad-
jacent Rydberg levels, or alternatively if a short, large
bandwidth laser pulse is employed in the preparation of
the Rydberg state.
In both cases the ground state is
coupled to a distribution of hydrogenic manifolds, and
the Rydberg electron is not excited to a high energy, sta-
tionary eigenstate of the hydrogen atom, but rather to
some time dependent wave packet. To a ﬁrst approxima-
tion the Rydberg wave packet oscillates with the Kepler
frequency of the eigenstate around which the distribu-
tion of principal quantum numbers is centered; therefore
a Rydberg wave packet contributes rapidly oscillating,
inter-manifold terms to the equations of motion for the
quantum expectation values. Such inter-manifold contri-
butions may be of ﬁrst order in the external ﬁeld.
In
this section we extend the validity of the classical, per-
turbative Eqs. (4) precisely to the case of Rydberg wave
packets, by time averaging the equations of motion over
a Kepler period and by showing that the secular, inter-
manifold contributions to the dynamics remain negligible
under the classical conditions for the external ﬁeld of Eq.
(6).

More precisely, the wave function of a Rydberg wave

packet is:

and the Heisenberg equations of motion for the expecta-
tion values of either ˆL or ˆa over the state of Eq. (24)
include “oﬀ-diagonal” matrix elements (for the sake of
brevity we call “oﬀ-diagonal” the matrix elements of any
operator between states from two diﬀerent hydrogenic
manifolds; whereas we will call “diagonal” the matrix ele-
ments between two states within the same n-manifold, re-
gardless of their angular momentum quantum numbers).
For example, if we indicate generically by ˆO the opera-
tor on the right hand side of the Heisenberg equations of
motion, in the case of ˆLı one has:

where we used the fact that ˆLı commutes with the unper-

elements vanish. Obviously, an identical expression holds
also for the equation of motion of the expectation value
of ˆaı

From the previous section, and also from Appendix A,

As we proved in the previous section, the diagonal ma-
(25) yield
trix elements in the right hand side of Eq.
exactly the same time evolution as the classical pertur-
bative equations. We will show below that under the
classical conditions for the external ﬁeld the oﬀ-diagonal
matrix elements of the double sum oﬀer a negligible con-
tribution to the dynamics. Before that, however, we must
discuss brieﬂy the operators of Eq. (26) and the magni-
tude of their matrix elements between two eigenstates of
the hydrogen atom.

First, the n ˆLı operator yields matrix elements the mag-
nitudes of which are at most <
n2. Moreover, ˆLı com-

mutes with the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian and there-
fore all oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements vanish, and it is very
easy to prove that its inter-manifold contributions to the
dynamics are negligible (see below).

Next, in the case of ˆrı the magnitude of the matrix
elements and, most importantly, their scaling with n are
determined solely by the radial matrix elements:

The result of Eq. (30) rests on the observation that
in the semiclassical limit the radial matrix elements of ˆrı
become rapidly very small for large ∆’s, as one can easily
see from by Eq. (29); and one may safely assume that for
nonnegligible matrix elements the diﬀerence between the
two principal quantum numbers is always much smaller
than any of the principal quantum numbers themselves
n′, nµ). Therefore one may legitimately
(e.g. ∆n′,µ
neglect higher order corrections in ∆n′,µ/n′.

≪

In fact, we assume precisely this important condition
throughout our argument: that is, we assume that the
variance of the distribution of the Rydberg wave packets
over the hydrogenic principal quantum numbers is always
much smaller than the principal quantum number at the
center of the the distribution, i.e., the approximate av-
erage principal quantum number of the Rydberg wave
packet. This is a very realistic approximation for most
laser pulses employed in the excitation of Rydberg elec-
trons, and it breaks down only for ultra-short, ultra-large
bandwidth pulses; or when the Rydberg state is excited
in presence of ultra-strong external ﬁelds.

In what follows we conduct our analysis in the most
general form. Although at some point we specialize our
argument to the case ˆO = ˆrı which yields the largest oﬀ-
diagonal contribution to the equations of motion, it will
be easy to see that the treatment of the case ˆO = nˆpıˆr
is completely analogous.

As we mentioned before, these oﬀ-diagonal matrix ele-
ments are present in the equations of motion either when
the high-energy electron is prepared in a wave packet, or
when the electron is initially conﬁned within a single n-
manifold, in which case they represent the second order
(in the external ﬁeld) corrections to the dynamics.

The dynamics of the matrix elements of Eq. (31) is

Clearly, all the terms of Eq. (39) oscillate with a fre-
quency comparable (but not identical !) to the Kepler
frequency ωK of the hydrogenic manifold at the center of
the the distribution of principal quantum numbers. We
indicate the principal quantum number of this special
hydrogenic eigen-manifold as ¯n. For very weak exter-
nal ﬁelds, the Kepler frequency is much larger than the
Stark frequency of the motion. This is true for the clas-
sical conditions on the ﬁelds of Eq. (6) and also, albeit
in a much stronger form, for the usual quantum condi-
tion of Eq. (9), i.e., the Inglis-Teller limit for negligible
inter-manifold mixing. This means that the wave packet
oscillates several times before the classical perturbative
equations of motion yield any signiﬁcant change in the ex-
pectation values of angular momentum and Runge-Lenz
vector. Therefore, following exactly the approach of clas-
sical perturbation theory for the derivation of Eqs. (4),
we time average the quantum dynamics over the Kepler
period TK = 2π¯n3 of the ¯n-manifold approximately at
the center of the energy distribution of the wave packet.
Such time averaging does not aﬀect the diagonal terms of
Eq (25); however, it allows us to evaluate with accuracy
the secular, oﬀ-diagonal contributions to the dynamics
over a time τ = γTS, that is, over some multiple of the
Stark period TS.

smaller than the average principal quantum number of
the wave packet. We conclude from Eq. (45) that ﬁrst or-
der, oﬀ-diagonal contributions are very small when com-
pared to the dominating principal quantum number of
the wave packet; indeed, this is a suﬃcient condition to
neglect them completely, because the quantum expec-

¯n to ¯n. Most impor-
Lenz vector range precisely from

the oﬀ-diagonal contribution remains small only up to

the secular eﬀects build up and oﬀ-diagonal terms be-
come relevant.

However, its deﬁnition can be easily generalized to the

Clearly, the analysis above does not yet yield any in-

negligible. To learn more about it, one must analyze the

in the equations of motion for the expectation values of

one obtains:

which is essentially the same as the classical condition of
Eq. (6), as we had claimed before.

Clearly, the same analysis applies to the terms of Eq.

lating part of the F4 and F6 terms.

Therefore, we next turn our attention to the remaining
terms from Eq. (39), that is, the contributions which are
proportional to F3 and F5 and also the non-oscillating
parts of the F4 and F6 terms as well. First, one needs
the time averages of the time dependent factors in the F3

It is easy to see from the previous analysis of the F1
terms that G(n′ℓ′m′; nℓm) is a negligible inter-manifold
contribution if and only if the expression within the curly
F ¯n3. However, each of
brackets of Eq. (49) scales as
the terms in the four sums consists of the product of
two matrix elements, and our previous analysis of the
magnitude of the matrix elements of ˆrı and also of any of
the possible choices for ˆO, indicates that all such terms

may scale as
third power of ¯n must originate from cross cancelations
between the four sums within the curly brackets.

Indeed, it is well known that the matrix element for an
atomic transition which increases both the energy and
the angular momentum of the electron is signiﬁcantly
larger than the one for a transition which brings about
the same change in energy, but leads to a smaller ﬁnal an-
gular momentum [80]. Therefore, if ∆ℓ′,ℓ = 0 a diﬀerent,
more complicated pairing of the terms must be employed,
which in this case may depend also on the angular part
of the matrix elements.

Scaling of the inter-manifold contribution with
the principal quantum number. In Fig (a) we plot the loga-
rithm of the maximum magnitude of the inter-manifold terms
vs. the logarithm of the principal quantum number, and the
approximate straight line indicates a simple power-law scal-
ing. In Fig (b) we plot the slope of the line in Fig. (a), i.e.,
the exponent of the power-law, which is clearly converging
to ξ = 3, thereby proving that in the semiclassical limit all
inter-manifold contributions become negligible.

The physical interpretation of our result is particularly
interesting. Rydberg wave packets which are relatively
well localized in energy move along the trajectories of the
classical electron or, for radial wave packets, of an ensem-
ble of classical electrons [20–43]. However, unless some
suitable external ﬁelds are applied to the system, [32–
43], they do so only for a few Kepler periods. Such wave
packets do not remain localized in the angular variable
and therefore spread along the classical ellipse. Even-
tually they display interference fringes as the front of
the packet catches up with its tail, and ﬁnally they also
show quantum revivals and superrevivals [20–22, 25, 27–
29]. However, from the point of view of the time aver-
aged equations of motion the electron is always spread
(i.e., averaged) along the classical trajectory, very much
like in classical mechanics, where after time averaging the
elements of the Kepler ellipse become the dynamical vari-
ables of the system, replacing the phase space coordinates
of the electron. Therefore the time averaged, quantum
equations of motion are insensitive to the spreading of
the wave packet, and to its revivals, and that is why the
same results as for stationary states can be legitimately
extended to wave packets too.

Note that the results of our analysis can be gener-
alized beyond the case of Rydberg electrons excited to
wave packets, and hold also when the Rydberg electron

that case, in fact, one needs only to replace

ﬁned within a n manifold, all oﬀ-diagonal terms in the
equations of motion for the quantum expectation values

the classical constraint on the external ﬁeld of Eq. (48)
holds in that case too.

Indeed, in the very important case of slow ion-Rydberg
collisions the Rydberg electron is initially excited to a
speciﬁc n-manifold, and in the next section we show
that some special linear combinations of hydrogen atom
eigenfunctions which are conﬁned within a hydrogenic
manifold (elliptic states [29, 65, 66]) yield the appropri-
ate quasi-classical initial conditions for the quantum ex-
pectation values of angular momentum and Runge-Lenz
vector, which then closely track the time averages of the
classical variables.

IV. CLASSICAL, QUASI-CLASSICAL AND
QUANTUM INITIAL CONDITIONS

In this section we discuss the initial conditions for the
equations of motion for the quantum expectation values,
and show that in the case of elliptic states [29, 65, 66]
the quantum expectation values track exactly the time
averages of the classical variables. More precisely, for a
classical Kepler ellipse, initially in the xy-plane, and with
the semimajor axis pointing along the x-axis, one has:

Lz = n√1
e2 , ax = ne
Lx = Ly = ay = az = 0 ,

where e is the eccentricity of the orbit, and, as usual, the
energy of the classical electron is:

state is given by a complicated superposition of spheri-
cal eigenstates of the hydrogen atom, all with the same
principal quantum number [29, 65, 66]), which is also lo-
calized in the xy-plane, and oriented like the classical
ellipse above, one has [29, 65, 66]:

large n’s the quantum expectation values and the classi-
cal predictions converge, and for elliptic states the quan-
tum expectation values not only obey the same pertur-
bative equations as the time averages of the classical
variables, but also have almost the same initial condi-
tions. Therefore they closely follow the same trajecto-
ries as the time averaged classical angular momentum
and Runge-Lenz vector. This result has already been
observed numerically [4, 81, 82], and also experimentally
[4, 8] for some special conﬁgurations of the external ﬁelds.
Most importantly, since elliptic states are coherent states
of the angular momentum [29, 65, 66, 84], i.e., states of
minimum uncertainty, it turns out that:

and in the semiclassical limit the expectation values of
ˆLı, ı = 1, 2, 3, are related to the expectation value of ˆL2
approximately like in classical mechanics. In fact, it has
been veriﬁed numerically in a few special cases [81, 82]
that not only the expectation values of ˆLı and ˆaı evolve in
time quasi-classically according to Eqs. (4), but also that
during the time evolution the state remains elliptic. This
is exactly the same situation as in classical mechanics,
where the electron keeps moving along an ellipse, but the
properties of the ellipse vary slowly in time; similarly, the
numerical evidence shows that the elliptic state remains
localized along a classical Kepler ellipse while it slowly
evolves in time.

and the initial conditions diﬀer dramatically from the
classical ones, which leads to some interesting considera-
tions.

As we explained before, the classical constraints of Eq.
(7) remain invariant under the evolution of the perturba-
tive equations. The second classical constraint translates
into a condition over the quantum expectation values,
which is also invariant:

is any state (elliptic, spherical or also a wave

quirements of our derivation. The invariant χ is related

the quantum invariant of Eq. (61) is equal to (n
however, for a spherical eigenstate χ is equal m2, which
for the small m’s typically excited by optical transitions
from the initial low-n state to the Rydberg high-n state
is a much smaller number than the classical result. This
poses severe limits on the largest possible expectation
value of any component of the angular momentum over
a spherical eigenstate; this feature might be exploited in
experiments to study the properties of Rydberg states.

−

The limitation which Eq. (61) imposes on the expecta-
tion values of angular momentum and Runge-Lenz vector
over spherical eigenstates stems from the fact that such
states have vanishing electric dipole moment; a small an-
gular momentum is not balanced by a large Runge-Lenz
vector, as it happens in classical ellipses and quantum
elliptic states. More precisely, for spherical states, the
electric ﬁeld cannot induce ﬁrst order dynamical eﬀects
because the expectation value of the Runge-Lenz vector
over a spherical eigenstate is zero (i.e., there is no perma-
nent electric dipole), and the state must ﬁrst be distorted
by the ﬁeld so that the expectation value of the angu-
lar momentum (or Runge-Lenz vector) can change. This
indicates that the dynamics must be at least of second
order in the external ﬁelds. This situation is germane to
the well known linear Stark eﬀect [80], where degenerate
perturbation theory and parabolic states must be used
to account for the linear dependence of the eigenvalues
on the external ﬁeld. In fact, a spherical eigenstate can
be seen as a superposition of elliptic states (or in a semi-
classical interpretation an ensemble of Kepler ellipses),
which are oriented uniformly in the xy-plane, so that the
total Runge-Lenz vector is averaged to zero.

The (at least) quadratic dependence of the time evolu-
tion on the ﬁeld can be explicitly veriﬁed by expanding
the time dependent operators in the Heisenberg picture,
[70] and by showing that the expectation values of the
ﬁrst order terms in the electric ﬁeld vanish. Using the
Hamiltonian of Eq. (2) (minus the diamagnetic term),
and writing the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian as ˆH0 one
has:

The simplest ﬁrst order term is a direct commutator of
the ﬁeld with a component of the angular momentum:
therefore it is either zero or a component of the position
operator (depending on the index ı), and its expectation
value over a spherical eigenstate vanishes. Other, more
complex ﬁrst order terms come from the double sum in
Eq. (62) and consist of a ﬁrst series of k commutators

the ﬁeld, and ﬁnally of a second series of (p

commutators with ˆH0 −
expectation value of any of such terms over a spherical
eigenstate of the hydrogen atom which is quantized along
the z-axis vanishes, simply because such state is an eigen-
ωL ˆLz. However, the same result can be
states of ˆH0 −
proven as follows also when the atom is quantized along
an arbitrary direction. I) The ﬁrst series of k commuta-
tors either vanishes or yields a component of the angular
momentum (depending on the index ı); II) the commu-
tator of the result of step I with the electric ﬁeld either
vanishes or yields a component of the position operator;
III) ﬁnally, the result of steps I and II must be commuted
ωL ˆLz; this sequence of
(p
commutators can be organized so that one does ﬁrst the
commutators with ˆLz and next those with ˆH0 because
these two operators commute with one another. Obvi-
ously, the expectation value of the commutator of any
operator with ˆH0 vanishes, if it is taken over an eigen-
state of ˆH0 itself. On the other hand the commutators
with ˆLz either vanish directly or yield a component of the
position operator, whose expectation value over a spher-
ical state also vanishes, and our point is proved.

Similar considerations apply also to ˆL2. In fact, it is
even easier to demonstrate that the time evolution of the

the commutator of any operator with ˆL2 vanishes, which
proves our point. Clearly, this result does not depend on
the orientation of the axis of quantization of the atom

Note that even if the time evolution of the expectation
values of ˆLı and ˆL2 is only of second order in the external
ﬁeld, that does not imply that weak external ﬁelds are
not eﬀective in bringing about changes of the angular
momentum. For example, in the expansion of Eq. (62)
the second order terms are multiplied by at least a square
power of the time; if we consider times comparable to the
Stark period and the scaling of the matrix elements of the
position operator with the principal quantum number as
given in Eq. (27), it is easy to see that the ﬁnal result is
not negligible. Moreover, the constraint on the quantum
invariant χ of Eq. (61) does not say much about the total
angular momentum of a spherical state, which is not a
coherent state of the angular momentum, and therefore
not only one has:

but the diﬀerence between the two sides of the equation
can be very large, as one can see by considering a state
with ℓ = n

1 and m = 0.

Since the results of the previous section show that un-
der the classical conditions for the external ﬁelds inter-
manifold contributions to the dynamics can be neglected,
all our considerations apply apply also to a superposition
of spherical states with diﬀerent n’s, and therefore our
analysis sheds some light on the nature of the Rydberg
states employed in ZEKE spectroscopy.

In ZEKE, ultra-high molecular Rydberg states [5–7,
50–53] are ﬁrst excited by few optical transitions and
successively ﬁeld ionized. This technique is extremely
successful because of the ultra-long lifetimes of these Ry-
dberg states, which are explained in terms of extensive
intrashell mixing of the initial, unstable low-ℓ states with
the longer lived high-ℓ states. For increasing angular mo-
menta the coupling between the Rydberg electron and
the molecular core becomes rapidly negligible, so that au-
toionization and predissociation channels are eﬀectively
quenched, and the Rydberg state becomes ultra-long-
lived. Therefore it is understood that ZEKE states, i.e.,
the ultra-long-living Rydberg states responsible for the
ZEKE signal, are complicated superpositions of large-n
spherical eigenstates of the hydrogen atom, which are
skewed in favor of large angular momentum states. Be-
cause of the small spacing of high-n Rydberg eigenener-
gies and of the width of the initial laser pulses, ZEKE
states initially consist of a superposition of several states
with diﬀerent principal quantum numbers [54, 55]. How-
ever, it is generally assumed that only one angular mo-
mentum quantum number is allowed in the superposition
because of the usual selection rules. The population of
higher-ℓ states is ascribed solely to the eﬀect of external
ﬁelds.

In fact, several experimental studies [5–7, 56] have
shown that the vanishingly small stray ﬁelds of the ex-
perimental set-up and, most importantly, the very weak,
slowly varying electric ﬁelds of the ions present in the
interaction region populate with great eﬃcacy the high-
ℓ Rydberg states which are responsible for the observed
ultra-long lifetimes of ZEKE states. On the theoreti-
cal side recent results [46–49, 54, 55], some of which were
based on the classical perturbative approach of Eqs. (4)
[46–49], have explained ℓ-mixing in terms of the hydro-
genic model, in which vanishingly small ﬁelds are suf-
ﬁcient to induce the desired scrambling of the angular
momentum quantum numbers. The great eﬀectiveness
with which such extremely weak ﬁelds (F <
1V /m) pop-
∼
ulate high-ℓ states strongly suggests that the hydrogenic
model is indeed appropriate to describe angular momen-
tum mixing in ZEKE states. Moreover, our present ﬁnd-
ings show that the previous classical results [46–49] are
really quantum mechanical in nature, and can also be ex-
tended to the case of wave packets. On the other hand,
the low-ℓ states excited by the laser pulse have a non-
negligible quantum defect, which decouples them from
the high-ℓ, quasi-hydrogenic states; it is then likely that

another mechanism is at work. More precisely, it is pos-
sible that the initial optical excitation of the ultra-high-n
states may not be strictly limited by the standard selec-
tion rules. Instead, by contributions which are of higher
order in the optical ﬁeld and yet are nonnegligible be-
cause of the ultra-large dipole moments of Rydberg states
-see Eq. (27) and Eq. (28)-, the initial optical pulse may
well populate a few angular momentum states with rel-
atively large ℓ’s, as one of us has recently shown [86].
Therefore, some degree of angular momentum mixing is
probably already present in the initial Rydberg state, in
which case the hydrogenic model, in its present extension
to superpositions of states with diﬀerent quantum num-
bers, provides an accurate description of how weak stray
and ionic ﬁelds bring about the (approximate) random-
ization in ℓ and m of ZEKE states, which accounts for
the observed ultra-long lifetimes.

Finally, the extension of equations Eq. (4) from purely
classical variables to quantum expectation values lends
strength to a previous argument of ours concerning slow,
ion-Rydberg collisions and which until now was based
solely on purely classical calculations [46, 47]. More pre-
cisely, we suggested the need for a review of both exper-
imental and theoretical results for the intrashell transi-
tions induced in Rydberg alkali atoms by slow collisions
with ions. In the case of slow ion-Rydberg collisions the
“magnetic” term of the Hamiltonian arises from the ro-
tation frequency of the ﬁeld, and the problem is treated
in the frame rotating with the ﬁeld itself. In that frame
the Hamiltonian is equivalent to the one of an hydrogenic
electron in weak electric and magnetic ﬁelds of constant
orientation, and time dependent magnitude [17, 46–48].
The ratio of the two magnitudes, however, remains con-
stant, and Eq. (4) can be solved exactly [46–48]. It is
then easy to see that after a full collision, the expectation
value of ˆLz is over a spherical eigenstate (that is with the
initial conditions of Eq. (60)), is [46, 47]:

the target. In a ﬁrst approximation, one may insert in
50n2 and a
Eq. (64) an average impact parameter b
reduced velocity ˜v
1, which are consistent with the
experimental conditions, and the coeﬃcient multiplying
m becomes >
0.9. Therefore the expectation value of ˆLz
∼
cannot change much, and if initially the electron is pre-
= 0 state, the expectation value of ˆLz will
pared in a m
not vanish. However, both in the interpretation of the
experimental data [60], and also in fully quantum the-
oretical treatments [61, 87–89] the assumption has been
made of a uniform population of the m substates, which
corresponds to a zero expectation value of ˆLz. For high
ℓ states this is a reasonably good approximation, even in

∼

the case of a non vanishing expectation value of ˆLz. How-
ever the approximation clearly breaks down for smaller
values of ℓ, which is precisely the regime for which we
suggested a critical review of current results.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have shown that under realistic con-
ditions, the classical and quantum dynamics of Rydberg
electrons in weak, slowly varying external ﬁelds agree be-
yond the mandates of Ehrenfest theorem.

We have shown that for the hydrogen atom in weak,
slowly varying electric and magnetic ﬁelds, to ﬁrst or-
der in the applied ﬁelds the quantum expectation values
of the components of the angular momentum and the
Runge-Lenz vector obey exactly the same equations as
the time averages (over a Kepler period and along a Ke-
pler ellipse) of the corresponding classical variables. Our
proof follows in spirit the approach of classical pertur-
bation theory, as we fully exploit the properties of the
zeroth order solutions of the quantum problem, exactly
as one does in classical mechanics where the time aver-
aging is done along Kepler ellipses, i.e., the zeroth order
solutions of the classical problem. Note that this result
is not an application of Ehrenfest’s theorem, because the
perturbative approach does not consist of the lineariza-
tion of the problem in the neighborhood of an equilibrium
point. Instead, it is an extension, in stronger form, of the
theorem for the important case of the hydrogen atom in
weak external ﬁelds.

Most importantly, in our derivation we have not ap-
plied Pauli’s replacement directly in the Hamiltonian
[31, 73, 74, 81, 82], and therefore we have been able to in-
vestigate the inter-manifold contributions to the dynam-
ics. In fact, by time averaging the dynamics over a Ke-
pler period (which, again, is exactly the same procedure
as in classical perturbation theory) we have shown that
inter-manifold terms do not contribute signiﬁcantly to
the evolution of the quantum expectation values, as long
as the strength of the external ﬁelds satisﬁes the same re-
quirement as in classical mechanics. Interestingly, in the
semiclassical limit the classical constraint is much weaker
than the quantum condition for negligible n-mixing, i.e.,
the Inglis-Teller limit.

This paradox can be resolved by observing that the
perturbative equations remain accurate only up to times
comparable to the Stark period, that is, for times which
in atomic units are
1/∆E, where ∆E is the energy sep-
aration between two Stark levels. Therefore, over such
relatively short times the stationary picture of the Stark
eigenstates which spread out of a hydrogenic n-manifold
does not have much physical signiﬁcance, and that is why
for these relatively short times the more stringent quan-
tum condition can be ignored.

∼

Moreover, by time averaging the inter-manifold dy-
namics we have also extended the validity of the clas-

sical perturbative equations to the case of Rydberg wave
packets, as long as the spread of the packet over the
hydrogenic eigen-manifolds is small compared to its av-
erage principal quantum number. Note, however, that
although our analysis shows that the quantum expecta-
tion values of angular momentum and Runge-Lenz vector
evolve in time like the classical time averaged variables,
it says nothing about the localization of the wave packet
and the quasi-classical dynamics of the packet itself. In
fact, our time averaging is precisely equivalent to consid-
ering a spread out version of the wave packet, smeared
along its orbit. This is the same situation as in classical
mechanics, where one studies the motion of the Kepler
ellipse, as if it the classical electron had been magically
smeared along its own trajectory.

We have also demonstrated that the close quantum-
classical equivalence can be extended, in the limit of very
large principal quantum numbers, to the initial condi-
tions of the equations of motion, provided that the ex-
pectation values are taken over elliptic states, which are
states localized along the classical solutions [29, 65, 66].
Therefore the quantum expectation values of angular mo-
mentum and Runge-Lenz vector over elliptic states fol-
low essentially the same trajectories as the time averages
of the corresponding classical variables. Such complete
quantum-classical equivalence, however, does not hold for
the more familiar spherical eigenstates (
) of the hy-
nℓm
i
|
drogen atom.

The realization that the hydrogenic, perturbative
equations of motion (which account so well for several
physical phenomena) can also be interpreted as purely
quantum mechanical equations has lead to some insight
into the nature the Rydberg states employed in ZEKE
spectroscopy; it also lends support to our result (previ-
ously only classical) which indicates that the averaging
over the ˆLz sublevels (which is used in quantum close-
coupling calculations to the end of making the problem
of ion-Rydberg collisions numerically more tractable, and
also in the interpretation of experimental data) may be
unjustiﬁed.

Finally, one may wonder if the special equivalence be-
tween the dynamics of the time averages of classical vari-
ables and quantum expectation values is a peculiarity of
the hydrogen atom in weak external ﬁelds, or if it can be
extended to other weakly perturbed integrable systems,
and the investigation of this problem is in progress in our
groups.

APPENDIX A: PROOF OF THE IDENTITY OF
EQ. (10)

In our proof of the special quantum-classical equiva-
lence of the dynamics of Rydberg electrons in weak ex-
ternal ﬁelds, we have made extensive use of the following
identity:

ψn

where ˆrı and ˆp are components of the position and me-
chanical momentum (i.e., ˆp = mˆv) operator respec-
is a state conﬁned within an hy-
ψn
tively, and where
|
drogenic n-manifold.

i

In this appendix we prove explictly the identity of Eq.
(A1), and we do so for all the pairs of indexes
to
stress that our derivation of the equations of motion does
not depend on the relative orientation between the initial
axis of quantization of the atom and the direction of the
applied, external ﬁelds in the Hamiltonian of Eq. (2).
We begin with the simplest case, that is when ı = :

ı, 

where ˆH0 is the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian and the re-
is an eigenstate of ˆH0. The
sult follows because
same approach could be extended to all cases. However,
a diﬀerent proof for the cases in which ı
=  is more
convenient to the end of studying the intermanifold con-
tributions to the equations of motion, which we do in the
main text of the paper [see Eq. (26)].

i

Therefore, we consider next the case ı = 2,  = 1:

iˆy

ˆpy, ˆLz
h

i
iˆy ˆpy ˆLz + i

ˆy ˆpx =

We must then show that the expectation value over

Clearly, the state

can be written as:

,

ℓ,m

where the Cn(ℓ, m)’s are some general coeﬃcients, possi-
bly complex. By substituting the expansion of Eq. (A5)
in the expectation value of Eq. (A4) one has:

ˆLz ˆy ˆpy

(A6)

where ¯Cn(ℓ′, m′) denotes the complex conjugate. On the
other hand, from Eq. (A2) it follows that:

nℓ′m′

ˆy ˆpy + ˆpy ˆy
nℓm

nℓ′m′

i
2ˆy ˆpy + [ˆpy, ˆy]

i

= 0 , (A7)

(A3)

(A5)

and therefore the matrix elements of ˆy ˆpy are:

nℓ′m′
h

ˆy ˆpy

nℓm

(A8)

By inserting the matrix elements of Eq. (A8) in the dou-
ble sum of Eq.
(A6) it is easy to see that each term
within curly brackets vanishes exactly, and therefore the
identity of Eq. (A4) is proved.

Next, we consider the case ı = 3,  = 1. One has:

(A10)

ˆz ˆpx = iˆz

Clearly, the matrix elements of ˆz ˆpz are also given by Eq.
(A8), and by inserting that result in Eq.
(A13) it is
easy to verify that once again the expression within curly
brackets vanishes.

Finally, an essentially similar argument proves that the
identity of Eq. (10) holds also for ˆz ˆpy, which completes
our proof.

APPENDIX B: TIME AVERAGING OF THE
INTER-MANIFOLD DYNAMICS

In this appendix we evaluate explicitly the time aver-
ages over a Kepler period TK of the inter-manifold con-
tributions to the equations of motion for the quantum
expectation values.

ˆy, ˆLz

and the expectation value of Eq (A10) becomes:

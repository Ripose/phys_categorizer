We calculate the one- and two-loop corrections of order α (Z α)6 and α2 (Z α)6 respectively, to the Lamb
shift in hydrogen-like systems using the formalism of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics. We obtain gen-
eral results valid for all hydrogenic states with nonvanishing orbital angular momentum and for the normalized
difference of S-states. These results involve the expectation value of local effective operators and relativistic
corrections to Bethe logarithms. The one-loop correction is in agreement with previous calculations for the
particular cases of S, P , and D states. The two-loop correction in the order α2 (Z α)6 includes the pure two-
loop self-energy and all diagrams with closed fermion loops. The obtained results allow one to obtain improved
theoretical predictions for all excited hydrogenic states.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The precise calculation of the electron self-energy contri-
bution to energy levels of hydrogen-like systems is a long-
standing problem in bound-state quantum electrodynamics.
The widely used direct numerical approach [1, 2, 3] is based
on a partial-wave decomposition of the Dirac-Coulomb prop-
agator, which corresponds to the exact all-order treatment of
the electron-nucleus interaction. The one-loop corrections
have already been calculated to a high numerical precision for
a wide range of nuclear charge numbers Z (including the case
of atomic hydrogen Z = 1), whereas the two-loop correction
has been obtained only for Z ≥ 10 with limited numerical
precision. The analytic method is based on an expansion in
powers of Z α and a subsequent analytic or semianalytic in-
tegration. The two approaches are complementary. In prac-
tice, the numerical method has primarily been used for sys-
tems with a high nuclear charge number, whereas the analytic
method usually provides more accurate predictions for low-Z
systems.

Here, we present a uniﬁed analytic derivation of the one-
and two-loop binding corrections of order (α/π) (Z α)6m c2
and (α/π)2 (Z α)6m c2 respectively,
for arbitrary bound
states of hydrogen-like system using the formalism of dimen-
sionally regularized nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics
(NRQED). This method allows for a natural separation of dif-
ferent energy scales, (i) the electron mass and (ii) the binding
energy, using only one regularization parameter: the dimen-
sion d of the coordinate space. This leads to a straightforward
derivation of radiative corrections in terms of expectation val-
ues of some effective operators and the Bethe logarithms. The
calculation of these operators is the main task of this work,
and we obtain them from standard electromagnetic form fac-
tors and the low-energy limit of the two-photon exchange scat-
tering amplitude.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, dimension-

In Sec.

ally regularized NRQED is outlined.
III, the one-
loop self-energy is derived by splitting the calculation into
low- (Sec. III B), middle- (Sec. III C), and high-energy parts.
The general one-loop result is presented in Sec. III D, and the
evaluation for D, P and S states in Secs. III E, III F and III G,
respectively. The two-loop correction is separated into four
different gauge-invariant sets of diagrams, see Figs. 1—4 be-
low. These are subsequently investigated in Secs. IV—VII.
Results are summarized in Sec. IX. Moreover, in Appendix C
we present the calculation of an additional two-loop logarith-
mic contribution to the ground state which was omitted in the
previous work [4].

II. DIMENSIONALLY REGULARIZED NRQED

As is customary in dimensionally regularized QED, we as-
sume that the dimension of the space-time is D = 4 − 2 ε,
and that of space d = 3 − 2 ε. The parameter ε is consid-
ered as small, but only on the level of matrix elements, where
an analytic continuation to a noninteger spatial dimension is
allowed. Let us brieﬂy discuss the extension of the basic for-
mulas of NRQED to the case of an arbitrary number of di-
mensions. Some basis of dimensionally regularized NRQED
in the context of hydrogen Lamb shift has already been for-
mulated in [5], however our approach presented below differs
in many details.

The momentum-space representation of the photon propa-
gator preserves its form, namely gµν /k2. The Coulomb inter-
action is

We now turn to relativistic corrections to the Schr¨odinger
Hamiltonian in an arbitrary number of dimensions. These cor-
rections can be obtained from the Dirac Hamiltonian by the
Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. In order to incorporate a
part of the radiative effects right from the beginning, we use an
effective Dirac Hamiltonian modiﬁed by the electromagnetic
form factors F1 and F2 (see, e.g., Chap. 7 of [6]),

e ~A, σij = [σi, σj]/(2 i), and the form factors F1, F2 are
deﬁned in Eq. (A1) below. In d = 3 spatial dimensions, the
matrices σij are equal to ǫijk σk. The electromagnetic ﬁeld in
HF W is the sum of the external Coulomb ﬁeld and a slowly
varying ﬁeld of the radiation.

There is an additional correction that cannot be accounted
It is represented by an

effective local operator that is quadratic in the ﬁeld strengths.
This operator is derived separately by evaluating a low-energy
limit of the electron scattering amplitude off the Coulomb
ﬁeld. An outline of this calculation are presented in Ap-
pendix B. The result is

electron mass is denoted by m, and δm is the one-loop mass
counter term. By ψ we denote the Dirac wave function. There
are three energy scales in Eq. (3.1), which imply a natural
separation of the one-loop δ(1)E into three parts,

The ellipsis denotes the omitted higher-order terms. We adopt
the following conventions: {X, Y } ≡ X Y + Y X, ~π = ~p −

Each part is regularized separately using the same dimen-
sional regularization. EL is the low energy part, where the
photon momentum is of order k ∼ (Z α)2 m. EM is the
middle-energy part, where k ∼ m, and the electron momen-
tum is p ∼ (Z α) m. Finally, EH is a high-energy part where
all loop momenta are of the order of the electron mass. It is
given by the forward three-Coulomb scattering amplitude and
is represented as a local interaction, proportional to δd(r).

The naming convention for the high-, middle-, and low-
energy parts is a little different from our previous convention.
E.g., in [8], the contribution referred to as the “high-energy
part” in this reference would correspond to the sum of the
“high-energy part” and the “middle-energy part” in the con-
text of the current evaluation. The renaming of the contribu-
tions is inﬂuenced by the NRQED-approach used here and by

the correspondence of the different parts to speciﬁc effective
operators. In this work, for all operators Q, we consider only
the expectation values for states with

[see Eq. (3.1)], denotes the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger–Pauli
wave function. In the following, we will denote the expecta-
tion value of an arbitrary operator Q, evaluated with the non-
relativistic Schr¨odinger–Pauli wave function, by the shorthand
notation hQi.

where we ignore terms of order ε and higher. Because the

it out consistently in the low-, middle- and high-energy parts,
and as well as in the form factors. Moreover, in the two-loop
calculations discussed below, we will drop the square of this
factor. The contribution EL0 can be rewritten as

here on derivation of the general expression for the α (Z α)6
term.

B. Low-energy part

In the low energy part, all electron momenta are of the or-
der of Z α, so in principle, one could perform a direct nonrel-

that enters into Eq. (3.1). It is more convenient however, in-
stead of using Eq. (3.1), to take the Dirac Hamiltonian with
an electromagnetic ﬁeld and to perform this expansion by ap-
plying the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The resulting
Hamiltonian, in d dimensions, is given in Eq. (2.9). Here, we
can neglect form factors and HF W becomes (from now on we
will set the electron mass m equal to unity)

(3.6)

The contribution from the Coulomb potential V is explicitly
separated from the additional electromagnetic ﬁelds ~E and ~B.
The Hamiltonian in Eq. (3.6) may be used to derive the low-
energy part which receives a natural interpretation as the sum
of various relativistic corrections to the Bethe logarithm. We
use the Coulomb gauge for the photon propagator, and only
the transverse part will contribute. This treatment of the low-
energy part is similar to previous calculations [8, 9], the dif-
ference lies in the presence of dimensional regularization.

where δd(r) is a d-dimensional Dirac delta function. One
could obtain EL1 by including this HR in Eq. (3.9). How-
ever, for the comparison with former calculations and for con-
venience we will return to Eq. (3.7), and split EL1 by intro-
ducing an intermediate cutoff Λ

We recall the relation Λ = λ (Z α)2. In all integrals with an
upper limit Λ to be discussed in the following, the divergent
terms in λ will be subtracted. Following earlier treatments
(e.g., [13]), we subtract exactly the term proportional to ln(λ),
but not ln(2 λ). The presence of the factor 1
2 under the loga-
rithm in Eq. (3.15) is a consequence of this subtraction.

The quantity β1 can only be calculated numerically. In con-
stitutes one of three contributions to relativistic Bethe loga-
rithm L, being deﬁned as in [13].

L = β1 + β2 + β3 .

(3.17)

Two others β2, β3 are deﬁned in Eqs. (3.20) and (3.25) below.
In this sense, the deﬁnition of β1 in Eq. (3.16) corresponds to
the deﬁnition of the low energy part L in Eq. (9) of Ref. [13].
The second relativistic correction EL2 is the nonrelativistic
quadrupole contribution in the conventions adopted in [8, 9].
Speciﬁcally, it is the quadratic (in k) term from the expansion
of exp(i ~k · ~r),

In a similar way as for EL1, we split the integration into
two parts, by introducing a cutoff Λ. In the ﬁrst part, with
the k-integral from 0 to Λ, one can set d = 3 and extract
the logarithmic divergence. In the second part, with the k-
integral from Λ to ∞, we perform a 1/k expansion and em-
ploy commutator relations, with the intent of moving the op-
erator H − E to the far left or right where it vanishes when
acting on the Schr¨odinger–Pauli wave function. In this way
we obtain

The third contribution EL3 originates from the relativistic corrections to the coupling of the electron to the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. These corrections can be obtained from the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.1), and they have the form of a correction to the current

C. Middle-energy part

We here consider the middle-energy part EM as the contribution originating from photon momentum of the order of the
electron mass and electron momenta of order Z α. In this momentum region, radiative corrections can be effectively represented
by electron form factors and higher-order structure functions. Electron form factors F1 and F2 modify the coupling of the Dirac
electron to the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the resulting effective Hamiltonian is given in Eq. (2.4). Here we assume that ~A = 0, A0
represents a static Coulomb potential, and ~E = −~∇A0 is the electric ﬁeld of the nucleus. One ﬁnds a nonrelativistic expansion
by the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation in Eq. (2.8), and the resulting Hamiltonian [see Eq. (2.9b)] after putting ~A = 0 and
neglecting F2(0)2 is

The leading (α/π) (Z α)4 one-loop correction reads

where the “radiative potential” δV is deﬁned as

EM0 = hδ(1)V i ,

and the superscript (1) in Eq. (3.28) denotes the one-loop component of δV . The expansion of Fi in powers of q2 is obtained in
Eq. (A3). Using these results, one obtains

Let us now consider the one-loop correction of relative-order (Z α)2. The ﬁrst contribution EM1 comes from the one-loop

The ﬁrst two terms corresponds to the α (Z α)4 term in
Eq. (3.4), whereas the latter terms give the α (Z α)6 con-
tribution. The relativistic Bethe Logarithm L, deﬁned in
Eq. (3.17), consists of a sum of β1 deﬁned in Eq. (3.16), β2
in Eq. (3.20), and β3 in Eq. (3.25). For the convenience of
the reader we brieﬂy recall that all matrix elements should be

evaluated in d = 3 spacetime dimensions, which implies

E. Results for D states

Our aim is to give a few numerical results for some phe-
nomenologically important hydrogenic states, based on the
general result (3.36). For D states, the wave function behaves
at the origin as ∼ r2. This means that a few matrix elements,
such as h~∇4V i, are actually vanishing. The following is a list
of the nonvanishing matrix elements for l = 2:

virtual photons, given in Eq. (5.116) of Ref. [8] for the 1S state and generalized to arbitrarily high principal quantum numbers
using Eq. (3.43). We have A60(nS) = L(nS) + H(nS) and recall that L =

with numerical results for the self-energy remainder function
as reported in Ref. [15] for these states.

One observes the somewhat irregular behavior of β1 as a func-
tion of n, which is partially compensated by the other contri-
butions to A60. Compared to other families of states with the
same angular momenta but varying principal quantum num-
ber [13], the A60 for S states display a rather unusual behav-
ior as a function of n, with a minimum between n = 2 and
n = 3. The calculations of the relativistic Bethe logarithms
L, for higher excited S states, are quite involved and will be
described in detail elsewhere. The value for 1S as reported
in Table I represents an improved result (with a numerically
small correction) as compared to the result communicated in
Ref. [8], as already detailed in [14]. For n ≥ 3, the results
for A60 have not appeared in the literature to the best of our
knowledge. The results for n = 3 and n = 4 are consistent

investigation here, can be written as

(cid:2)

Here, the indices of the coefﬁcients indicate the power of Z α
and the power of the logarithm, respectively. The coefﬁcient
B40 is well known (for reviews see e.g. [11, 12]), and we focus
here on general expressions for the α2 (Z α)6 coefﬁcient. We
split the calculation into four parts, labeled i—iv according to
the subsets of diagrams in Figs. 1—4. This entails a separation
of the two-loop energy shift according to

δ(2)E = δ(2)Ei + δ(2)Eii + δ(2)Eiii + δ(2)Eiv .

(4.2)

The speciﬁc contributions will be considered subsequently in
the following sections of this article. The B-coefﬁcients cor-
responding to the subsets i—iv will be distinguished using
appropriate superscripts.

We ﬁrst focus on the pure two-loop self-energy diagrams
as shown in Fig. 1 and denote the corresponding energy shifts
and B-coefﬁcients by a superscript i. As compared to the
one-loop case treated in Sec. III, the two-loop calculation in-
volves a few more terms with regard to the form-factor con-
tributions. However, as it has been stressed in Refs. [16, 17],
the leading order of the two-loop low-energy part is already
(α/π)2 (Zα)6, so there are no relativistic or quadrupole cor-
rections to include at this energy scale. More precisely, we

Here, the contributions EL, EM and EH are appropriately
redeﬁned for the two-loop problem [cf. Eq. (3.2) for the one-
loop case]. We use deﬁnitions local to the current Section for
the speciﬁc contributions.

The two-loop EH is a high-energy part given by a two-
loop forward scattering amplitude with three Coulomb ver-
tices. Because it leads to a local potential (proportional to a
Dirac δ in coordinate space), the term EH does not contribute
to the energy of states with l 6= 0 or to the normalized dif-
ference of S-states. So, we will not consider this contribution
here. For S states, this term gives an n-independent contribu-
tion to the nonlogarithmic term B60.

FIG. 1: Pure two-loop self-energy diagrams (subset i of the two-loop
diagrams). The double line denotes the bound-electron propagator.

The form-factor contribution EF corresponds to an integra-
tion region where both photon momenta are of the order of the
electron mass, but the electron momentum is of the order of
Z α. This part is a sum of two terms:

EF = EF 1 + EF 2 .

(4.4)

The ﬁrst term EF 1 comes from two-loop form factors, in the
same way as the one-loop EM1 [see Eq. (3.32)]. It contains
additionally an iteration of the one-loop potential δ(1)V and
the term proportional to κ2 from Eq. (2.9b):

The two-loop form factors are given in Eq. (A3) below, and δ(1)V, δ(2)V are the one- and two-loop components respectively of
the potential given in Eq. (3.29). The explicit form of δ(2)V i can be found in Eq. (4.20) below.

EF 2 comes from the low-energy two-loop scattering amplitude and is the analog of the one-loop EM2 in Eq. (3.34). The

effective interaction is

It is a remarkable fact that this two-loop scattering-amplitude contribution is infrared ﬁnite, in contrast to the corresponding
one-loop result in Eq. (3.34).

For the two-loop problem, we redeﬁne EM to be the contribution where one of the photon momenta is of the order of the
electron mass, the second photon momentum is of order (Z α)2 and the electron momenta are of order Z α. In the spirit of
NRQED, the contribution coming from large photon momenta is accounted for by form factors. Therefore EM is given by the
correction to Bethe logarithms coming from one-loop form factors. It is a sum of two parts

The contribution EM1 is similar to the one-loop term EL1 with HR replaced by δ(1)V :

EM = EM1 + EM2 .

We calculate it by splitting the integral in two parts k < Λ and k > Λ in analogy to the one-loop case,

We have not approached the limit d = 3 in the ﬁrst part, because δ(1)V contains 1/ε. It will eventually cancel when combined
with EL, and only then one approaches this limit. EM2 is similar to the one-loop EL3 and comes from the F2(0)-correction to

ized Bethe logarithms N , β4, and β5 is more complicated (see Refs. [13, 18]). The calculation of the two-loop Bethe logarithm
bL for arbitrary excited hydrogenic states is a challenging numerical problem. So far results have been obtained only for excited
S states [16, 17]. The formula (4.18) thus provides the basis for complete two-loop calculations in the order α2 (Z α)6, and
reduces the remaining part of the problem, for a general hydrogenic state, to a well-deﬁned and in essence merely technical nu-
merical calculations. In the following sections we discuss the evaluation of the formula (4.18) for particular hydrogenic states for
which the generalized Bethe logarithms can be inferred from previous calculations. These comprise the ﬁne-structure difference
of D and P states, and the normalized difference for S states.

For D states, we use the general result (4.18) and the fact that matrix elements involving a Dirac-delta function vanish. Thus,
logarithmic terms for D levels vanish, Bi
61(D5/2) = 0. The absence of logarithmic terms even holds for the sum
of all two-loop diagrams (not only for the subset i), and even for arbitrary states with orbital angular momentum l > 2. This
result generalizes the well-known fact that the double-logarithmic contribution B62 vanishes for states with l ≥ 2 [19, 20]. For
the ﬁne-structure difference of Bi

Numerical values of the relevant quantities for n = 2, . . . , 6 can be found in Tab. II. They are in full agreement with results
previously obtained in [21]. The generalized Bethe logarithms β4 and β5 in these expressions are equivalent to the quantities
∆fsℓ4(n) and ∆fsℓ5(n) as deﬁned in Ref. [21]. In the context of the current investigation, the numerical values of ∆fsℓ4(n) and
∆fsℓ5(n) were reevaluated with improved accuracy as compared to Ref. [22] and the data in Tab. II are consistent with them.

E. Results for the normalized difference of S states

We evaluate the general formula given in Eq. (4.18) for the normalized difference of S states, using the matrix elements given
in Eq. (3.42). In the result, we identify terms with the square of the logarithm ln[(Z α)−2] (Bi
62 coefﬁcient), and with single
logarithm (Bi

most important ones reported in this paper, because of the high accuracy of two-photon spectroscopic experiments which involve
S–S transitions.

The generalized Bethe logarithms β4 and β5, which make an occurrence in Eq. (4.18) but are not present in Eq. (4.27), vanish
for S states. The result (4.27) can also be written as

Bi

60(nS) − Bi

60(1S) = bL(nS) − bL(1S) + R(n) ,

(4.28)

which provides a deﬁnition of the remainder R(n). Numerical values for bL(nS), N (nS), R(n) and the normalized S-state
difference Bi
60(1S) are given in Table II, and we have the opportunity to correct a calculational error for N (2S)
whose value had previously been given as 12.032209 in [18].

VI. COMBINED SELF-ENERGY WITH A FERMION LOOP IN THE COULOMB PHOTON LINE

The Feynman diagrams in Fig. 3 represent the modiﬁcation of a leading one-loop self-energy correction by a perturbing
~∇2V . One can easily obtain the result from EL0 + EM0 in Eqs. (3.9) and
Uehling potential VU = − 4
(3.30), by replacing the Coulomb potential V by V + VU , and expanding all matrix elements in VU , up to the linear terms. The
result is

Here, N is a correction to the Bethe logarithm as deﬁned in
Eq. (4.21a). All matrix elements in this result vanish for D-
states and for states with higher angular momenta. The ab-
sence of both logarithmic as well as nonlogarithmic terms

holds from subset iii holds for arbitrary states with orbital
angular momentum l > 2. For P states, we obtain the ﬁne-
structure difference Biii
61 (nP3/2)−Biii
61 (nP1/2) = 0, in agree-
ment with the literature. For the nonlogarithmic term, we ob-

As a last example, we consider the S-state normalized dif-
ference deﬁned in Eq. (3.3). using matrix elements given
in (3.42). For the double-logarithmic term, we recover the
known result Biii
62 (nS) = 0 (see Refs. [4, 23]). The result for
Biii
61 reads [4, 23]

This result is recovered here from Eq. (6.1). As a new result,
we obtain the complete n-dependence of the nonlogarithmic
term Biii

The ﬁrst term in this result corresponds to the α2 (Z α)4 term

We ﬁrst notice the complete absence of logarithmic terms
in the result (7.6). All matrix elements in (7.6) vanish for D-
states and for states with higher angular momenta, in the order
of α2 (Zα)6. The ﬁne-structure difference of the nonlogarith-
mic term for P states is as follows,

The two-loop subsets i—iv (see Figs. 1—4) have been con-
sidered in Secs. IV—VII. We are now in the position to add
the results given in Eqs. (4.18), (5.1), (6.1) and (7.6), and to
present a general expression for the complete two-loop cor-
rection to the Lamb shift, including the vacuum-polarization
terms, valid for general hydrogenic bound states with nonvan-
ishing angular momenta, and for the normalized difference of
S states. This general result reads

The third line in the above equation corresponds to the lower-order α2(Zα)4 contribution (B40 coefﬁcient). We now turn to the
evaluation of this expression for S states. The sum of the contributions in Eqs. (4.27), (5.5), (6.4) and (7.8) corresponds to the
sum of all the matrix elements in Eq. (8.1), evaluated for the normalized difference of S states. The logarithmic terms [4] have
already been veriﬁed for the normalized difference. The n-dependence of the total nonlogarithmic term may be expressed as

B60(nS) − B60(1S) = bL(nS) − bL(1S) + A(n),

where A(n) is an additional contribution beyond the n-dependence of the two-loop Bethe logarithm, deﬁned in analogy to
Eq. (4.28). The result for A is

Numerically, A(n) is found to be much smaller than bL(nS)−
bL(1S), as shown in Table VI. This implies that the numer-
ically most important contribution to B60(nS) − B60(1S) is
exclusively due to the two-loop Bethe logarithm. The theo-
retical uncertainty of B60(nS) − B60(1S), for higher excited
nS states, is caused entirely by the numerical uncertainty of
the two-loop Bethe logarithm bL(nS), with explicitly data for
higher excited states taken from Ref. [17].

The same holds for any hydrogenic states with orbital angular
momentum l ≥ 2. For P states, an evaluation of (8.1) conﬁrm

IX. SUMMARY

For the ﬁne-structure difference of D states, the total two-
loop results is obtained by evaluating the general result in
Eq. (8.1) on D states, or alternatively by adding just the con-
tributions from subsets i and ii [see Eqs. (4.22) and (5.3)],
because the subsets iii and iv do not contribute to the D ﬁne
structure. For the P -state ﬁne structure, the sum of the results
in Eqs. (4.24), (5.4), (6.2), and (7.7) gives the complete result,
including the nonlogarithmic term B60. It has already been
stressed that in order to determine the absolute value of B60
for P and D states, an evaluation of the Bethe logarithm bL for
these states would be required, and its knowledge is currently
restricted to S states.

Despite this, we may evaluate general logarithmic terms for
P and D states. For D states and states with higher angular
momenta, a direct evaluation of Eq. (8.1) immediately reveals
that the logarithmic terms vanish,

B62(nD) = B61(nD) = 0 .

(8.4)

We have presented a uniﬁed approach to the one- and two-
loop electron bound-state self-energy correction in hydrogen-
like atoms, including terms of order α (Z α)6 and α2 (Z α)6,
respectively. We consider states with nonvanishing orbital an-
gular momentum and the normalized difference of S states.
The general analytic structure of the one- and two-loop cor-
rections is given in Eqs. (3.4) and (4.1), respectively. The gen-
eral result for the one-loop correction is given in Eq. (3.36).
We evaluate our formulas for speciﬁc families of hydrogenic
states in Secs. III E, III F, and III G (one-loop case). All one-
loop results are in agreement with those previously reported
in the literature. In addition, we obtain results for the nonlog-
arithmic terms (A60 coefﬁcients), for higher excited S states,
as listed in Tab. I.

For clarity, we separate the two-loop calculation into four
different subsets i, ii, iii and iv consisting of separately
gauge-invariant diagrams (see Secs. IV—VII and Figs. 1—
4). A general formula for the “pure” two-loop self-energy

diagrams is presented in Eq. (4.18). The corresponding ex-
pression, for the self-energy vacuum-polarization diagram in
Fig. 2, can be found in Eq. (5.1). For the subsets iii and iv,
we present general expressions in Eqs. 6.1 and 7.6. For the
total sum of the two-loop effects, a summary is provided in
Sec. VIII.

The two-loop ﬁne-structure difference for P states for the
subset i as given in Eq. (4.24) is in agreement with previous
results [21, 22]. This constitutes an important cross-check of
the method used in the current investigation, which is based
on dimensional regularization, and on effective operators for
the contributions stemming from hard virtual photons. The
results given in Eqs. (5.4), (6.2), and (7.7) complete the ﬁne-
structure difference of P states in the order α2 (Zα)6.

The central result of the current investigation, however, is
the complete n-dependence of all two-loop logarithmic and
nonlogarithmic contributions to the Lamb shift of S states
up to the order α2 (Z α)6. In this regard, our study follows
a number of previous investigations on related subjects (see
Refs. [4, 26, 27, 28]), where the logarithmic terms were pri-
marily investigated, but the nonlogarithmic term was left un-
evaluated. The n-dependence of all logarithmic terms for
S states [corresponding to the B62 and B61 coefﬁcients in
Eq. (4.1)] is recovered in full agreement with the literature.
For the B61 coefﬁcient, we refer to Eqs. (4.26) and (6.3).
Moreover we obtain in Appendix C an additional logarithmic
contribution B61(1S) to the ground 1S state, which was omit-
ted in the former work [4].

Partial results for the n-dependence of the nonlogarithmic
term B60(nS) are given in Eqs. (4.27), (4.27), (6.4) and (7.8).
A summary including all two-loop subsets is provided in
Eqs. (8.1), (8.2) and (8.3). Our results lead to predictions for
the S-state normalized difference with an accuracy of the or-
der of 100 Hz (see Ref. [29] and Appendix D). We ﬁnd that the

18

largest contribution to the n-dependence of B60 stems from
the two-loop Bethe logarithm bL, but the remaining contribu-
tions in Eqs. (5.5), (6.4) and. (7.8) are essential for obtaining
complete predictions (see also Tables VI and VII).

form factors which involves a closed fermion loop (see Fig. 2).

We can now turn to the scattering amplitude T . The expres-

APPENDIX B: LOW-ENERGY LIMIT OF THE
SCATTERING AMPLITUDE

In the leading order, the electron self-energy can be incor-
porated by electromagnetic form factors F1 and F2, and more
precisely by the leading terms of its low momentum expan-
sion. In the higher order, namely α (Z α)6, single vertex form
factors Fi are not sufﬁcient, and the additional term is the low-
energy limit of the spin-independent part of the scattering am-
plitude with two γ0 vertices, (see Fig. 5), with the form factor
contributions subtracted. This term, has not yet been consid-
ered in the literature. A detailed derivation is postponed to a
separate paper; here we present only a brief derivation.

and this expression deﬁnes our normalization. The presence

and the static momentum t, such that t = (1,~0) and t2 = 1.
Because we consider the scattering of a static potential, the
exchange momenta are spatial,

To construct the projection operators for a spin independent
part of the scattering amplitude, let us consider the matrix el-
ement of an arbitrary operator ˆQ, namely ¯u(p′, s′) ˆQ u(p, s),
where u(p, s) is a positive solution of the free Dirac equation,
normalized according to ¯u u = 1. We transform this matrix
element to the more convenient form

use an approximate form of u(p, s),

The one- and two-loop radiative corrections, T (1) and T (2),
are obtained using standard rules of quantum electrodynam-
ics. However, we additionally subtract from these amplitudes
the corresponding form factor contribution. This subtraction
is carried out using the tree diagram with the vertex γ0 re-
placed by Γ0,

(B10)

The vertex function Γµ is deﬁned in Eq. (A1). In the one-loop
order, the subtraction permits the approximation Γµ ≈ 1 for
one of the vertices, with a form-factor correction at the other,
and a second term where the approximations at the vertices are
interchanged. For the two-loop case, it is understood that the
subtraction includes only (α/π)2 terms, so there are a total
of three terms, one with both vertices modiﬁed by one loop
corrections, and two others where only one vertex receives a
two-loop correction. After the form-factor subtractions and
small momenta expansion, the scattering amplitude takes a
simple form

T (i) = q1 · q2 χ(i) ,

Since this additional contribution is numerically small, it does

now slightly smaller. We postpone further conclusions until

which can be associated to the e2 ~E2 = (~∇V )2 term in the

We denote the Lamb shift of an nS states by ∆E(nS) and
use the deﬁnition in Eq. (67) of Ref. [9]. We focus on the
evaluation of the normalized difference for S states, which
we denote as

∆n ≡ n3 ∆E(nS) − ∆E(1S) .

(D1)

Important contributions to the Lamb shift as used for the data
in Table VII, can be found in Tables 1—10 of Ref. [11]. The
new results derived in this article for the nonlogarithmic two-
loop term B60(nS) − B60(1S) can now be used for an im-
provement of the accuracy of the theoretical predictions as
listed in Table VII.

Extrapolations of the two-loop Bethe logarithms bL(nS),
and of the A60 coefﬁcients in Table I, to higher principal quan-
tum numbers, are performed by assuming a functional form
of the type a + b/n + c/n2 for the correction, with a, b and
c as constant coefﬁcients. This functional form has recently
been shown to be applicable to a variety of quantum electro-
dynamic corrections for bound states, see e.g. Refs. [13, 18].
The same functional forms are used to extrapolate the differ-
ence GSE(α) − A60, as a function of n, to higher principal
quantum numbers [numerical results of the nonperturbative
self-energy remainder GSE(α) can be found in Refs. [15, 30]].

The principal theoretical uncertainty with regard to the nor-
malized difference ∆n currently originates from the unknown
n-dependence of the two-loop coefﬁcient B71(nS). An esti-
mate for this correction may be obtained as follows. We ﬁrst

(C5)

21

map the one-loop coefﬁcient A50 onto an effective Dirac delta
potential V50, with

B71-coefﬁcient, may be found e.g. in Eq. (20) of Ref. [4]. The
calculation leads to the estimate

Of course, ~∇2V = 4πδ3(r), and we may use this potential
as an “input” for evaluation the additional one-loop correc-
tion to the Bethe logarithm generated by the local potential.
This leads to a correction of order α2 (Zα)7, with logarith-
mic terms. The leading double-logarithmic term (correspond-
ing to a B72-coefﬁcient) is n-independent. The well-known

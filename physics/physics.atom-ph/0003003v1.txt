It is shown that the magnetic state decoherence produced by collisions in a thermal vapor can

be suppressed by the application of a train of ultrafast optical pulses.

In a beautiful experiment, Itano et al. demonstrated
the Quantum Zeno eﬀect [1]. A radio frequency pi pulse
having a duration on the order of 250 ms was applied to
a ground state hyperﬁne transition. At the same time,
a series of radiation pulses was used to drive a strongly
coupled ground to excited state uv transition. The rf and
strong transitions shared the same ground state level.
Itano et al. showed that excitation of the rf transition
could be suppressed by the uv pulses. They interpreted
the result in terms of collapse of the wave function -
spontaneous emission from the excited state during the
uv pulses is a signature that the uv pulse projected the
atom into its ground state; the lack of such spontaneous
emission implies projection into the ﬁnal state of the rf
transition. This paper triggered a great deal of discus-
sion, especially with regards to the interpretation of the
results [2].

A necessary condition for a quantum Zeno eﬀect is a
perturbation of a state amplitude on a time scale that
is short compared with the correlation time of the process
inducing the transition. In the experiment of Itano et al.,
this time scale is simply the duration of the pi pulse, 256
ms. On the other hand, if one wished to inhibit particle
decay or spontaneous emission [3], it would be necessary
to apply perturbations on a time scale that is short com-
pared with the correlation time of the vacuum, an all
but impossible task. In this paper,we consider the inhi-
bition of collisional, magnetic state decoherence, by the
application of a train of ultrafast, optical pulses. This
correlation time of the collisional perturbations resulting
in magnetic state decoherence is of order of the dura-
tion of a collision and is intermediate between that for
the coherent pi pulse applied by Itano et al. and the
almost instantaneous, quantum jump-like process pro-
duced by the vacuum ﬁeld. It should be noted that re-
lated schemes have been proposed for inhibiting decoher-
ence in systems involving quantum computation [4], but
the spirit of these proposals diﬀers markedly from the
one presented herein.

The rapid perturbations of the system are a necessary,
but not suﬃcient, condition for a mechanism to qualify as
a Quantum Zeno eﬀect. The perturbations must involve
some ”measurement” on the system for the ”Quantum
Zeno” label to apply. The suppression of magnetic state
coherence discussed in this paper is not a Quantum Zeno
eﬀect in this sense. We will return to this point below.

We envision an experiment in which ”active atoms” in
a thermal vapor undergo collisions with a bath of foreign
gas perturbers. A possible level scheme for the active
atoms is depicted in Fig. 1. At some initial time, an
ultrashort pulse excites an atom from its ground state,
having angular momentum J = 0, to the m = 0 sub-
level of an excited state having J = 1. The duration of
the excitation pulse τp is much shorter than the dura-
tion of a collision τc (τc is typically of order 1 ps). As
a result of elastic collisions with the ground state per-
turbers, population in the J = 1 sublevels equilibrate at
a rate Γcol that is typically of order 107 − 108 s−1 per
Torr of perturber pressure. The transfer to the m = 1
substate is probed by a circularly polarized pulse act-
ing on the J = 1, m = 0 → J = 0 excited state transi-
tion, applied at a time Γ−1
col following the initial excitation
pulse. For the sake of deﬁniteness, we assume that the
perturber pressure is such that equilibration occurs in a
time Γ−1
col = 0.1 − 1.0 ns. The question that we address
in this paper is ”How can one inhibit this magnetic state
decoherence by subjecting the active atoms to additional
external radiation ﬁelds?”

As was mentioned above, the key to any Zeno-type ef-
fect is to disrupt the coherent evolution a system from its
initial to ﬁnal state. In our case, the coherent evolution
from the initial m = 0 states to the ﬁnal m = ±1 states
is driven by the collisional interaction. Thus it is neces-
sary to disturb the system on a time scale that is short
compared with the collision duration τc. To do this, we
apply a continuous train of ultrashort pulses that cou-
ple the m = 0 level to the excited state having J = 0
shown in Fig. 1. The pulses are assumed to have dura-
tion τp ≪ τc and are assumed to be oﬀ-resonance; that is
the atom-ﬁeld detuning is large compared with τ −1
p . As
such, each pulse simply produces an ac Stark shift of the
m = 0 sublevel of the J = 1 state, resulting in a phase
shift of this state amplitude. As a consequence, the exter-
nal pulses break the collision-induced, coherent evolution
of the atom from its initial m = 0 state to the m = ±1
states. If the pulse strengths are chosen such that the
phase shift is a random number, modulo 2π, and if many
pulses occur during the collision duration τc, then the
atom will be frozen in its initial state. It is interesting
to note that collisions, which are normally viewed as a
decohering process, must be viewed as a coherent driving
mechanism on the time scales considered in this work.

To obtain a qualitative understanding of this eﬀect, it
is suﬃcient to consider a model, two-level system, con-
sisting of an initial state |0i (corresponding to the J = 1,
m = 0 state) and a ﬁnal state |1i (corresponding to the
J = 1, m = 1 state, for example). The Hamiltonian for
this two-state system is taken as

H = Vc(t) (|0i h1| + |1i h0|) + ¯hXi

∆s(ti)τpδ(t − ti) |0i h0| ,

(1)

where Vc(t) is a collisional perturbation that couples the
two, degenerate states, and ∆s(ti) is the ac Stark shift
of state |0i produced by the external pulse occurring at
t = ti. For simplicity, we take Vc(t) to be a square
pulse, Vc(t, b) = ¯hβ(b), for 0≤ t ≤ τc. The quantity b
is the impact parameter of the collision. Without loss
of generality, we can take the collision to start at t = 0.
The collision duration τc can be written in terms of the
impact parameter b characterizing the collision and the
relative active atom-perturber speed u as τc(b) = b/u.
Moreover, to simulate a van der Waals interaction, we

set β(b) = (C/b6
chosen such that 2C/(b5
0u) = 1. The quantity b0 is an
eﬀective Weisskopf radius for this problem. An average
over b will be taken to calculate the transition rate.

The external pulse train is modeled in two ways. In
model A, the pulses occur at random times with some
average separation T between the pulses.
In model B,
the pulses are evenly spaced with separation T. In both
models, the pulse areas ∆s(ti)τp are taken to be random
numbers between 0 and 2π. A quantity of importance is
the average number of pulses, n0 = τc(b0)/T = b0/(uT ),
for a collision having impact parameter b0.

A. Randomly-spaced pulses

The randomly spaced, radiative pulses act on this two-
level system in a manner analogous to the way collisions
modify atomic electronic-state coherence. In other word,
the pulses do not aﬀect the state populations, but do
modify the coherence between the levels. The pulses can
be treated in an impact approximation, such that dur-
ing a collision, the time rate of change of density matrix
elements resulting from the pulses is ˙ρ00 = ˙ρ11 = 0 and

˙ρ10/ρ10 = ˙ρ01/ρ01 = −ΓD1 − e−i∆s(ti)τpE = −Γ,

(2)

where Γ = T −1 is the average pulse rate and we have
used the fact that the pulse area is a random num-
ber between 0 and 2π. Taking into account the colli-
sional coupling Vc(t, b) between the levels, one obtains
evolution equations for components of the Bloch vector
w = ρ11 − ρ00 = 2ρ11 − 1, v = i(ρ10 − ρ01) as

dw/dx = U (y)v;

dv/dx = −U (y)w − n(y)v,

(3)

where x = t/τc(b) is a dimensionless time, y = b/b0
is a relative impact parameter, and U (y) = y−5 and
n(y) = n0y are dimensionless frequencies. These equa-
tions are solved subject to the initial condition w(0) =
−1; v(0) = 0, to obtain the value ρ11(x = 1, y, n0) =
[w(x = 1, y)+ 1]/2. The relative transition rate S is given
by

where N is the perturber density. A coeﬃcient, R(n0),
which measures the suppression of decoherence, can be

It is now an easy matter to numerically integrate Eqs. (5)
to obtain R(n0). Before presenting the numerical results,
we can look at some limiting cases which provide insight
into the physical origin of the suppression of decoherence.
A plot of ρ11(x = 1, y, n0) as a function of y = b/b0 is
shown in Fig. 2 for several values of n0. With decreasing
y, ρ11 increases monotonically to some maximum value
ρ11(ym) and then begins to oscillate about ρ11 = 1/2

with increasing amplitude. One concludes from such
plots that two eﬀects contribute to the suppression of
coherence. The ﬁrst eﬀect, important for large n0, is a
reduction in the value of ym. The second eﬀect, impor-
tant for n0 of order unity, is a decrease in the value of
ρ11(ym). Let us examine these two eﬀects separately.

The n−2/11
dependence is a general result for a colli-
sional interaction that varies as the interatomic sepa-
ration to the minus 6th power.
It can be understood
rather easily. The pulses break up the collision into
n0y segments, each having a (dimensionless) time du-
ration xb = 1/(n0y). Each segment provides a perturba-
tive contribution to ρ11 of order y−10(n0y)−2, provided
y < yw, where yw is to be determined below. The to-
tal population from the entire collision interval varies as
ρ11 ∼ y−10(n0y)−2n0y = y−11/n0. Of course, ρ11 can-
not exceed unity. One can deﬁne an eﬀective relative
Weisskopf radius, yw, as one for which ρ11 = 1, namely
yw = bw/b0 = n−1/11
. The total transition rate varies as
w ∼ n−2/11

, in agreement with (7). As n0 ∼ ∞, the
atom is frozen in its initial state.

For values of n0 of order unity, the dominant cause of
the suppression of decoherence is a decrease in the value
of ρ11(ym), rather than the relatively small decrease in
ym from its value when n0 = 0. For values n0 ≤ 3,
approximately 45% of the contribution to the transition
rate S(n0) originates from y > ym, and, for these val-
ues of n0, ym ∼ π−1/5 and ρ11(ym) ∼ (1 + e−n0/2π1/5
)/2.

This allows us to estimate the suppression of decoherence
ratio as R(n0) = [0.55 + .45(1 + e−n0/2π1/5
)/2], such that
R(1) = 0.93, R(2) = 0.88, R(3) = 0.84. These values
are approximately 70% of the corresponding numerical
results, indicating that the decrease in ρ11(ym) accounts
for approximately 70% of the suppression at low n0, with
the remaining 30% coming from a decrease in ym. The
ﬁrst few collisions are relatively eﬃcient in suppressing
decoherence. With increasing n0, the suppression process
slows, varying as n−2/11
. In Fig. 3, the suppression of de-
coherence ratio R(n0), obtained by a numerical solution
of Eq. (5), is plotted as a function of n0.

B. Uniformly Spaced Pulses

We consider now the case of equally spaced pulses, hav-
ing eﬀective pulse areas that are randomly chosen, mod-
ulo 2π. The time between pulses is T , and n0 = τc(b0)/T .
For a relative impact parameter y = b/b0, with m ≤
n(y) = n0y ≤ m + 1, where m is a positive integer or
zero, exactly m or m + 1 pulses occur. The eﬀect of
the pulses is calculated easily using the Bloch vector. At
x = 0, w = −1 and v = 0. The Bloch vector then un-
dergoes free evolution at frequency U (y) = y−5 up until
the (dimensionless) time of the ﬁrst pulse, xs = ts/τc(b).
The pulse randomizes the phase of the Bloch vector, so
that the average Bloch vector following the pulse is pro-
jected onto the w axis. From x = xs to xs +T /τc(b) = xs
+1/n(y), the Bloch vector again precesses freely and ac-
quires a phase U T = y−5/n(y) = y−6/n0, at which time
the next pulse projects it back onto the w axis. Taking
into account the periods of free precession and projec-
tion, and averaging over the time xs at which the ﬁrst
pulse occurs, one ﬁnds

(8)

In the limit that n0 ≫ 1, for all impact parameters that
contribute signiﬁcantly to the transition rate, approxi-
mately n(y) pulses occur at relative impact parameter y,
implying that w(y) ∼ cosn(y)[y−5/n(y)] and

which is the same functional dependence found for the
randomly spaced pulses. Note that the form {1 −
cosn(y)[y−15/n(y)]} is identical to that found in theories
of the Zeno eﬀect [1].

The suppression of decoherence ratio R(n0), obtained
from Eqs. (5) and (8) [using ρ11 = (1 + w)/2], is plotted
in Fig. 3. The fact that it lies below that for randomly
spaced pulses is connected with the diﬀerence in the av-
erage collisional phase shift acquired between radiation
pulses for the two models. The oscillations in R(n0) ap-
pear to be an artifact of our square pulse collision model.
In the absence of the pulses, the ﬁrst maximum in the
transition cross section occurs for ymax = (π)−1/5, corre-
sponding to a π collision pulse. With increasing n0, the
pulses divide the collision duration into approximately
n(y) equal intervals. If these pulse intervals are odd or
even multiples of π, one can enhance or suppress the con-
tribution to the transition rate at speciﬁc impact param-
eters. Numerical calculations carried out for a smooth
interatomic potential do not exhibit these oscillations.

C. Discussion

Although the collisional interaction has been modeled
as a square pulse, the qualitative nature of the results
is unchanged for a more realistic collisional interaction,
including level shifts. In fact, for a smooth interatomic
potential that allows for an increased number of radiation
pulses over the duration of the collisional interaction, the
suppression is slightly enhanced from the square pulse
values. Although the pulses are assumed to drive only

4

the J = 1, m = 0 → J = 0, excited state transition, it is
necessary only that the incident pulses produce diﬀerent
phase shifts on the J = 1, m = 0 and J = 1, m = 1 state
amplitudes.

To observe the suppression of decoherence, one could
use Yb as the active atom and Xe perturbers. The Weis-
skopf radius for magnetic decoherence is about 1.0 nm
[5], yielding a decoherence rate of ≃ 1010 s−1 at 500 Torr
of Xe pressure at 300◦C, and a collision duration τc(b0)
≃ 2.5 ps. Thus, by choosing a pulse train having pulses
of duration τp =100 fs, separated by 0.5 ps, it is possible
to have 5 pulses per collision. If an experiment is carried
out with an overall time of 100 ps (time from initial exci-
tation to probing of the ﬁnal state), one needs a train of
about 200 pulses. To achieve a phase shift ∆sτp of order
2π and maintain adiabaticity, one can take the detuning
δ = 3×1013 s−1 and the Rabi frequency Ω ≃ 1×1014 s−1
on the J = 1, m = 0 → J = 0, excited state transition [6].
The corresponding, power density is ≃ 1.5×1011 W/cm2,
and the power per pulse is ≃ 150 µJ (assuming a 1 mm2
focal spot size). This is a rather modest power require-
ment. With 5 pulses/collision duration, one can expect
a relative suppression of magnetic state decoherence of
order 40%.

Finally, we should like to comment on whether or not
the eﬀect described in this work constitutes a Quantum
Zeno eﬀect. Normally, the Quantum Zeno eﬀect is pre-
sented as a projection of a quantum system onto a given
state as a result of a measurement on the system.
In
the experiment of Itano et al., this ”measurement” is re-
ﬂected by the presence or absence of spontaneously emit-
ted radiation during each uv ”measurement” pulse. The
measurement pulse must be suﬃciently long to produce
a high likelihood of spontaneous emission whenever the
atom is ”projected” into the initial state by the pulse.
Following each measurement pulse, the oﬀ-diagonal den-
sity matrix element for the two states of the rf transition
goes to zero.
In our experiment involving oﬀ-resonant
pulses, the number of Rayleigh photons scattered from
the J = 0 level during each applied pulse is much less
than unity. As such, there is no Quantum Zeno eﬀect,
even if suppression of magnetic state decoherence occurs.
On average, each pulse having random area destroys the
coherence between the J = 1, m = 0 and J = 1, m = ±1
state amplitudes, but does not kill this coherence for a
single atom. With an increasing number of radiation
pulses, n0, however, both the average value and the stan-
dard deviation of the transition probability tends to zero
as n−1

for each atom in the ensemble.

The experiment of Itano et al. could be modiﬁed to
allow for a comparison with the theory presented herein,
and to observe the transition into the Quantum Zeno
regime. If the pulses that drive the strong transition are
replaced by a sequence of oﬀ-resonant pulses, each pulse
having a duration τp much less than the time, Tπ, re-
quired for the pi pulse to drive the weak transition, and
each pulse having an eﬀective area, ∆sτp = (Ω2/4δ)τp,
that is random in the domain [0,2π], then the pulses will

0

suppress the excitation of the weak transition (it is as-
sumed that Ω/δ ≪ 1). If the upper state decay rate is γ,
then the average number of Rayleigh photons scattered
during each pulse is n = (Ω/4δ)2 γτp. For n < 1, there is
suppression of the transition rate as in our case, while, for
n >
∼ 1, there is suppression and a Quantum Zeno eﬀect.
There is no average over impact parameter, since exactly
[Tπ/T ] or ([Tπ/T ]+1) pulses in each interval between the
pulses, where [x] indicates the integer part of x.

Abstract

We report the theoretical evaluations of the static scalar polarizability of the 133Cs ground state

and of the black body radiation shift induced on the transition frequency between the two hyper-

ﬁne levels with mF = 0. This shift is of fundamental importance in the evaluation of the accuracy

of the primary frequency standards based on atomic fountains and employed in the realization

of the SI second in the International Atomic Time (TAI) scale at the level of 1

10−15.

I. Introduction

The evaluation of the accuracy of the cesium primary frequency standards requires to take into

account, among others, the shift induced on the clock transition
62S1/2, F = 3, mF = 0
|
i
International System of Units (SI) is in fact based on the above transition observed in absence

by the black body radiation (BBR). The deﬁnition of the second in the

of any perturbation and then, in particular, at T = 0 K [1], where T is the temperature of the

environment.

Gallagher and Cook [2] ﬁrstly considered the eﬀects of BBR on the Rydberg states of the

atoms while Itano et al. [3] focused their attention onto the atomic frequency standards. They
reported the following expression for the relative frequency shift of the 133Cs clock transition

(ν0 = 9192631770 Hz):

10−2 when T0 = 300 K. This expression has been

adopted till now to correct all the primary frequency standards for the BBR shift at an accuracy
level of 10−15 or even better [4].

The BBR induces both non resonant ac Stark and Zeeman shifts of the atomic transitions.
For the ground state 2S1/2 of the alkali-metal atoms the Zeeman shift is of the order of 10−17 [3]
and is not relevant for the accuracy estimation of the present frequency standards.

The direct experimental method to evaluate the BBR shift is based on (1): the frequency shift

∆ν is measured versus the black body temperature T and the experimental points are ﬁtted with

(1) whose temperature dependence follows directly from the Planck radiation law. This method

has been used by Bauch and Schroeder [5] employing a thermal cesium beam and in our group

using an atomic fountain [6].

In order to increase the experimental resolution, the BBR shift may be also evaluated indi-

rectly by measuring the dc Stark shift coeﬃcient k deﬁned as:

∆ν = kE2

where ∆ν is the frequency shift induced by the static electric ﬁeld E. Measurements of k have

been performed in this way by Haun and Zacharias [7] and by Mowat [8], using a thermal beam

and the Ramsey interrogation technique, and by Simon et al. [9] using an atomic fountain. The
BBR shift is then obtained from (2) assuming E:

The measurement of the scalar static polarizability α0 is related to the above method through

where W is the potential energy of a neutral atom in a static electric ﬁeld E of moderate strength.

Due to the very low intensity of the black body ﬁeld, the hyperpolarizability eﬀect is negligible

[11] and will not be considered throughout the paper.

The polarizability is obtained from the force acting on the atom when submitted to a gradient

of the electric ﬁeld:

F =

W = α0E

This force, in turn, can be measured through the deﬂection of thermal beams [12, 13], through

E-H gradient balances [14, 15] or through the time of ﬂight of cooled atoms in a fountain apparatus

[16, 17]. In principle, the BBR shift can be also obtained from (3) and (4) as follows:

¿From the theoretical point of view, the evaluation of the BBR shift requires the computation

of the scalar polarizabilities of the two states deﬁning the clock transition or, in other words, of

the non resonant ac Stark shift. This is typically performed through perturbation techniques

[18, 19]. More precisely, according to (6), we have to calcolate the diﬀerential polarizability

between the two ground state hyperﬁne levels. As pointed out by Feichtner et al.

[20], this

requires to consider in the theoretical analysis a basis of modiﬁed eigenfunctions which account

for the hyperﬁne interaction of the ground and P states with other states of the same quantum

numbers F and mF . A review of the theoretical works leading to the evaluation of the ground
state 133Cs polarizability can be found in [15] and in [17].

Due to the basic importance of the BBR shift correction to evaluate the present primary
frequency standard accuracy at the 10−15 level and, in the next future at the 10−16 level, it is

highly desirable to re-examine the relation (1) considering that:

3

(i) new and more precise experimental data are now available for the electric dipole moments
and for the transition frequencies of 133Cs involved in the theoretical computation of α0;

(ii) recent theoretical evaluations of α0 [21] lead to a signiﬁcantly lower value than that com-

monly assumed up to now [3, 8];

(iii) the two most precise measurements [9, 17] of the electrical polarizability do not agree to

each other.

In this paper we report an ab-initio computation of the BBR shift for the clock transition which

×

comparison with the theoretical and experimental values reported in the literature will be also
given, showing the present diﬃculty to asses the accuracy at the 10−16 level for atomic frequency

standards operating at T

has to be subtracted in order to take the isotropy of the black-body radiation into account [3, 9].

III. Numerical Evaluation

To evaluate numerically the BBR shift given by (17) we need the matrix elements of the operator
r; writing the atomic position vector r as an irreducible rank 1 tensor operator we have:

where r is expressed in terms of its spherical components r0, r−1 and r1; θ (co-latitude) and ϕ
(azimuth) are the polar angles deﬁning the electric ﬁeld direction with respect to the quantization

axis (z axis). The well-known Wigner-Eckart [24] theorem allows us to simplify the generic matrix

quantum numbers only one of the three Q terms is not zero.

Actually, as Feichtner et al. [20] pointed out, the S1/2 state and the P states wave functions

are perturbed by the eﬀect of their hyperﬁne interaction with other states with the same F

and mF but with diﬀerent principal quantum number n. Therefore, the dipole matrix elements

should not be calculated between the unperturbed wave functions but between the perturbed

Table 3: Coeﬃcients cnJF (in units of 10−6) for perturbed cesium 7P wave function

These coeﬃcients are very small (of the order of 10−6) and their contribution to the absolute

value of the scalar polarizability is completely negligible. However, they must be taken into

account in order to obtain the correct value of the diﬀerential polarizability we are interested in.

The ground state wave function is more sensitive to the hyperﬁne interaction so in this

calculation the corresponding sum in (23) has been extended from n = 7 to n = 9; the coeﬃcients

bnJF and cnJF essentially involve higher order corrections and we considered only the ﬁrst term

To evaluate numerically the absolute and the diﬀerential polarizability we need to know the

reduced dipole matrix elements and the frequencies of the transitions involved in this calculation.

Several experimental [17, 26, 27, 28] and theoretical [29, 30, 31, 32] works have been devoted to

the determination of the dipole matrix elements. In particular, the measurement of the excited

These frequencies are known with an accuracy high enough so that we do not consider their

contribution to the evaluation of the uncertainty in the ﬁnal result.

As far as the anJF , bnJF and cnJF coeﬃcients are concerned, we observe that in their deﬁnition

the knowledge of the wave function at the origin is required. In turn, the wave function depends

on the potential used to describe the interaction of the valence electron with the nucleus and with

the closed electron shells [33]. In other words, this potential accounts for the departure from the

hydrogen potential. Due to the diﬃculty in modelizing this interaction, we made a conservative

estimation, attributing an uncertainty of 10% to the coeﬃcients anJF , bnJF and cnJF .

Inserting all these quantities and the respective uncertainties in (17) we obtain:

In (27) the uncertainty is mainly due to the uncertainty of the coeﬃcients anJF , bnJF and cnJF .

We notice that the result (27) has been obtained by means of the integration in (22) over the

11

solid angle Ω which has allowed us to calculate the scalar polarizability we are interested in; as

a check, we obtain the same value using directly the Sandars formula [23]. If we estimate the

BBR shift by using the polarizability value computed for a well deﬁned orientation of the electric

ﬁeld with respect to the quantization axis, the non-zero tensorial part of the polarizability itself
10−16 in 133Cs,

leads to small errors in the coeﬃcient β. More precisely, β changes of about 3

×
depending on whether the electric ﬁeld is parallel or perpendicular to the z axis.

¿From (17) and (18) we have also for the Stark shift coeﬃcient:

In (30) the ﬁrst result is the value expressed in SI units, the second one in CGS units and the

IV. Discussion of the results

We ﬁrstly examine the scalar polarizability value reported in (30); even if it does not lead di-

rectly to the BBR shift of the hyperﬁne transition we are looking for, it represents anyway an

important check of a part of our computations and provides an independent estimation of this
important parameter. The total scalar polarizability α0 must take the core polarizability αc
0 into
consideration which accounts for approximately the 4 % of the total value in the case of 133Cs

[22]. Our ﬁnal result for α0 is then:

In Table 6 we report the data found in literature with an uncertainty lower than 1 %.

An agreement at a level of

10−3 can be observed, well inside the quoted error bars, both

between the theoretical computations and with respect to the experimental value of Amini and

Gould [17].

In Figure 2 the result of our computations concerning the BBR shift parameter β is compared

with the experimental results reported in literature.

Our result agrees with the direct measured values while the indirect measurements, even if

in agreement among them, are higher by three standard deviations. This discrepancy has to

be deeply examined not only for the correct estimation of the diﬀerential polarizability of the

ground state hyperﬁne transition but also for its impact into the accuracy evaluation of the

primary frequency standards. First of all, the following points have to be considered:

(i) our theoretical result leads to a polarizability α0 of the 2S1/2 state in agreement with the
most recent and precise evaluations as shown in Table 6, while the indirect measurements,

considering that the Stark eﬀect is proportional to the polarizability at the ﬁrst order, lead

to a considerably higher value for α0;

(ii) our computations lead to the result of Itano et al. [3] if we use the old values of the transition

frequencies [34] and of the electric dipole moments [20, 33]; the latter, in particular, are

considerably higher than the most precise recent values;

(iii) our β value agrees with the values obtained with the direct measurement method.

Taking the above remarks into account, the following hypothesis may be considered in order

to explain this discrepancy:

(i) the assumption of equivalence between ac and dc Stark shifts is not fully correct, in spite

also of the correction term ǫ introduced by Itano et al. [3];

triangle we indicated the indirect measurements, while with the square the direct ones. a is Ref.
[6], b is Ref. [9], c is Ref. [5], d is Ref. [8], and e is Ref. [7].

(ii) a systematic shift is present in the indirect measurements due to a physical eﬀect not

considered and present in the experiment.

Since we have no reason at the moment to believe in the breakdown of the equivalence between

ac and dc Stark shifts, as far as the second hypothesis is concerned, the following point should

be examined. All the measurements performed with the indirect method are based on a Ramsey

interaction scheme with a Stark ﬁeld applied during the free ﬂight of the atoms between the two

interaction regions. The atoms experience then two sudden changes of the electric ﬁeld which

could perturb the free evolution of the hyperﬁne coherence or induce Majorana-type transitions.

The last hypotheses must be considered more a clue than a probe to explain the discrepancy

under question and obviously requires a more complete theoretical treatment.

V. Conclusions

We have reported in this paper a theoretical evaluation of the 2S1/2 ground state polarizabil-
ity of 133Cs and the BBR shift of the ground state hyperﬁne transition between the magnetic

ﬁeld independent sublevels. The former is in really good agreement with recent theoretical and

experimental values; the latter agrees with the direct measurements reported in the literature

and is lower by three standard deviations than the values obtained from dc Stark measurements.

The discrepancy of 2

10−15 at T =300 K between the more recent estimations and the value

×

accepted up to now impacts the accuracy evaluation of the primary frequency standards at the

level of two or three times their believed standard uncertainties. Moreover, serious problems may
10−16 for the future

be expected from the BBR shift to asses the accuracy at the level of 1

microwave frequency standards operating at T

300 K.

Appendix

To avoid the singularity at ν = ναk in section II we have omitted the ν2 term in the denominator

of (7). This simpliﬁcation, usually adopted in literature, is justiﬁed by the fact that near room

temperature the energy content of the BBR is peaked at frequencies much lower than the lowest

transition frequency of the atom. An estimation of the error due to this approximation is provided

in [3] with the introduction of the corrective term ǫ in (1). Here we re-evaluate this term following

also the method described in [35].

The main term of (36) coincides with (17), as expected. As regards the corrective term ǫ, following

the same procedure to evaluate the dipole matrix elements in the basis of modiﬁed eigenfunctions
10−2, in agreement with the value reported in

as reported in section III, we obtain ǫ = 1.4

×
[3]. This agreement is not surprising because the recent values of the the dipole moments aﬀect

signiﬁcantly the main parameter β, but much less the corrective term ǫ, as can be observed in

(37) where they appear both in the numerator and in the denominator.

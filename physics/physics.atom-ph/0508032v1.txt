Do van der Waals interactions determine the smallest nanostructures that can be used for atom
optics? This question is studied with regard to the problem of designing an atom interferometer
with optimum sensitivity to de Broglie wave phase shifts. The optimum sensitivity to acceleration
and rotation rates is also considered. For these applications we predict that nanostructures with a
period smaller than 40 nm will cause atom interferometers to perform poorly because van der Waals
interactions adversely aﬀect how nanostructure gratings work as beam-splitters.

Atom interferometers that are built with nanostruc-
ture gratings have proven their ability to detect small
perturbations to atomic de Broglie waves. Examples of
quantities measured with this technique include: the po-
larizability of Na atoms [1], the index of refraction for
Na atom waves due to a dilute gas [2, 3], the strength
of atom-surface van der Waals interaction potentials [4],
and the rotation rate of a platform [5, 6]. Because all
of these measurements are related to interference fringe
phase shifts, an important design goal for atom interfer-
ometers is to optimize the sensitivity to the phase of an
interference pattern. This goal was discussed by Scully
and Dowling [7] for matter-wave interferometers in gen-
eral, and then discussed for atom interferometers that
are based on mechanical absorption gratings by Pritchard
[6, 8] and also by Vigu´e [9, 10]. However, none of these
analyses speciﬁcally include the eﬀect of van der Waals
(vdW) interactions between atoms and the nanostrucure
gratings.
In this paper we review how phase sensitiv-
ity can be maximized by selecting the open fraction of
each grating; then we show how vdW interactions mod-
ify these calculations. Finally, we show how vdW inter-
actions determine the minimum period of nanostructure
gratings that can optimize the performance of atom in-
terferometers for inertial sensing.

van der Waals interactions between atoms and material
gratings change the diﬀraction eﬃciencies, en, which we
deﬁne as the modulus of the diﬀracted wave amplitude in
the nth order as compared the wave amplitude incident
on the grating,

The eﬀect of vdW interactions is generally marked by an
(cid:12)
increase in en for n > 1 and a decrease in e0, but the ef-
ﬁciencies en depend non-linearly on the strength of vdW
interactions as discussed in [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In this
paper we will use newly identiﬁed scaling laws for en to
describe how the vdW interactions aﬀect the interference
pattern and the statistical sensitivity to phase shifts in
a three-grating Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer. The
impact of vdW interactions is particularly important if
the grating period is reduced below 100-nm and the atom

beam velocity is reduced below 1000 m/s. This analy-
sis shows how vdW forces set fundamental limits on the
smallest nanostructure features that can be used for atom
interferometry. For example, grating windows that are 20
nm wide will optimize the sensitivity to rotations or ac-
celerations for an atom interferometer with 1000 m/s Na
atoms and 150 nm thick silicon nitride gratings.

The layout of a Mach Zehnder atom beam interferom-
eter is shown in ﬁgure 1. The ﬁrst grating (G1) serves as
a beam splitter. The second grating (G2) redirects the
beams so they overlap in space and make a probability
density interference pattern I ′(x′) just before the third
grating (G3). Because the detector in this example is
located close enough to G3 so that diﬀraction from G3 is
not resolved, the third grating simply works as a mask.
The transmitted ﬂux I(x3) depends on position of the
third grating, x3, relative to the other gratings as

I(x3) =

[1 + C cos(kgx3 + φ)]

as wi/d where wi is the window size for the ith grating
(G1 G2 or G3), and d is the grating period. We will
show that other factors in addition to the open fractions
such as the strength of the vdW interaction, the atom
beam velocity, and the absolute size of the nanostructure
gratings are needed to completely determine ψI and ψII
relative to ψinc.

tain equation 14, it was assumed that eG2

veriﬁed to be a good approximation by the symmetry of
the experimentally observed diﬀraction patterns [13, 17].
Note that if diﬀraction from G3 can be resolved, as
in the interferometer built by Toennies [18, 19], then G3
acts as a beam combiner (not a mask) and C2
becomes
a function of the diﬀraction eﬃciencies of all three grat-
ings. This applies also for phase gratings and has been
considered by Vigu´e [9], however we will restrict this pa-
per on vdW interactions to the case of nanostructure
gratings with G3 acting as a mask. Near ﬁeld diﬀraction
from the collimating slits and C3 dependent near ﬁeld
eﬀects from G3 are explicitly ignored here.

The three bracketed terms in equation 16 are functions

and are listed on the ﬁrst row of table I. This concludes
our review of how to get optimum interference fringe pat-
terns (with minimum σφ) from an atom interferometer

Next we will show how vdW interactions modify the
best open fractions for G1 and G2. To predict how the
diﬀraction eﬃciencies change as a result of the vdW in-
teraction we will use a numerical calculation described
in [14, 15] and summarized here. The van der Waals
potential is

V (r) =

C3
r3 ,

−

(17)

where r is the distance to an inﬁnite plane and C3 is the
vdW coeﬃcient. The vdW coeﬃcient for sodium atoms
and silicon nitride surfaces has been measured to be C3 =
3 meVnm3 [14] and for helium and silicon nitride C3 =
0.1 meVnm3 [11]. The phase shift for atom waves passing
through a slot between two grating bars, as discussed in

references [4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], is

(18)

where ξ is the coordinate inside the grating channel
(ξ = 0 in the middle of the window), ℓ is the thickness
of the grating, ~ is Planck’s constant divided by 2π, and
v is the atom beam velocity. Equation 18 is obtained
by assuming parallel-sided slot walls, neglecting edge ef-
fects at the entrance and exit to the slot, and using the
WKB approximation to ﬁrst order in V (r)/E (potential
over kinetic energy). Despite all these approximations,
equation 18 has been used (occasionally with a modiﬁ-
cation for non-parallel walls) to explain several experi-
mental observations regarding vdW interactions between
atoms and nanostructure gratings [4, 11, 12, 14, 15].

With the vdW-induced phase shift, φ(ξ), given by
equation 18 incorporated into the transmission function
for the grating, the diﬀraction eﬃciencies in the far-ﬁeld
approximation are

This exact choice of parameters is arbitrary, but conve-
nient to simplify equation 20. The diﬀraction eﬃciencies
thus depend on the vdW coeﬃcient, atom velocity, grat-
ing period, grating thickness, and the grating open frac-
tion. This can be compared to equation 15 in which the
eﬃciencies depend only on the open fraction. If C3 = 0,
the eﬃciencies depend only on p1 and p2, and equation
20 reduces to equation 15.

Now we have derived all the relationships (equations
14 and 20) needed to compute the ﬁgure of merit C2

as a function of the vdW coeﬃcient C3. Figure 4 shows

eters (v=1000 m/s, d=100 nm, ℓ = 150 nm and open
fractions (0.56, 0.50, 0.37)) that are similar to those in
experiments [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 19] with supersonic atom
beams and state-of-the-art silicon nitride nanostructure
gratings. As shown in ﬁgure 4, the ﬁgure of merit for this
set of parameters is a monotonically decreasing function
of C3. In other words, the sensitivity to phase shifts be-
comes worse as vdW interactions get stronger. For grat-
ings with geometric dimensions that are related by the
ratios (w : d : ℓ = 1 : 2 : 3) similar to the 100-nm period
gratings that are now available, the quantity C2
/Iinc

is reduced by more than 1/2 (which means that a mea-
surement of φ with comparable uncertainty would require
more than twice as much time) when

Since this condition is nearly satisﬁed in experiments [1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 19], we are motivated to ask the question, “is
it ever worth using sub-100-nm period gratings for atom
interferometry?” Or, to paraphrase Richard Feynmann,
“is there no more room at the bottom?” We will address
this question by exploring how the open fractions and
all the parameters in p3 aﬀect the ﬁgure of merit for
minimum σφ; then as a separate issue we will investigate
how the sensitivity to rotation and acceleration is aﬀected
by vdW interactions.

The open fractions can be made larger or smaller by al-
tering the nanostructure fabrication procedure described
in [20, 21, 22]. So we used equations 14 and 20 to spec-
ify what open fractions should be chosen to optimize the
interferometer if C3 = 3 meV nm3 and the other param-
eters are kept v = 1000 m/s, ℓ = 150 nm, and d = 100
nm. The three terms that contribute to the result for
C2
in equation 14 are each plotted in ﬁgure 3 as a
function of open fraction for the cases C3 = 0, 3, and 30
meVnm3. The optimum open fractions for each of these
cases are summarized in table I, and were used to gener-
ate additional functions plotted in ﬁgure 4 for C2
/Iinc

The new values of w1 and w2 that maximize C2

when C3 6
values found for the case of C3 = 0. This can be un-
derstood qualitatively because larger open fractions are
needed to compensate for the eﬀect of increased C3; in-
creasing the strength of the vdW interaction causes a
change to en that is similar to (but not exactly the same
as) the eﬀect of decreasing the open fraction of the grat-
ing.

If extremely large open fractions (w

d) are possible
to obtain for G1 and G2, then it is approximately cor-
rect to replace the equation 24 by stating that C2

This last condition is consistent with replacing d

atom combinations that do not satisfy the inequality 25,
it is not possible to restore C2

value of 0.0070 regardless of the open fractions. This
shows that vdW interactions set a fundamental limit on
the smallest nanostructures that can be used for atom
interferometry before the performance as determined by
the minimum σφ degrades.

Equation 25 can be approximately derived analytically
by ﬁnding the condition for which the phase begins to
oscillate rapidly (

This analytic approach is justiﬁed because the regions of
rapidly oscillating phase do not contribute signiﬁcantly
to the integral in equation 19, and we know from our ear-
lier study of optimization without vdW interactions that
the combination of replacing the limits by approximately
d/4 and d/4 and ignoring the φ(ξ) term in equation

Identifying the independent parameter p3 helps to clar-
ify several scaling laws. For example, if every geomet-
ric dimension of the gratings (d,w, and ℓ) were multi-
plied by 1/a, then the eﬃciencies en would change as if

law, the eﬃciencies en, and ﬁgure of merit C2

Next we address the question, “What period grating
would optimize an atom beam gyrometer or accelerome-
ter?” Because the interference fringe phase shift, φ, due
to either rotation or acceleration depends on d and v
there is a diﬀerent function to optimize for optimum sen-
sitivity to inertial displacements.

The Sagnac phase shift for a matter wave interferom-

eter rotating at the rate Ω is

where A is the area enclosed by the interferometer paths,
and L is the distance between gratings G1 and G2 (or
equivalently G2 and G3) [6]. In the last equation it was
assumed that the vector orientations of Ω and A are par-
allel. The statistical variance in measured rotation rate
will then be given by

Hence, maximizing the quantity

will minimize the variance in measured rotation rate, and
will therefore minimize the angle random walk obtained
when using a gyrometer for inertial navigation. For mea-
surements of acceleration with minimum variance, the
quantity F (2v)−2 should be maximized.

FIG. 5: The ﬁgure of merit for inertial sensors, F , given by
equation 31 is plotted vs grating period given the restriction
w : d : ℓ = 1 : 2 : 3 for all three gratings, and the param-
eters C3 = 3 meVnm3, and v = 1000 m/s (thick line). For
comparison if C3 = 0 (thin line) then F depends on d−2.

The tradeoﬀ is as follows. For smaller d an atom in-
terferometer gyroscope is limited by vdW interactions,
and for larger d the response factor (dφ/dΩ) is smaller.
The quantity F is plotted in ﬁgure 5 as a function
of d assuming v = 1000 m/s, C3 = 3 meVnm3 and
(w : d : ℓ = 1 : 2 : 3) for each grating. An optimum pe-
riod of d = 44 nm is found.

The main result is that nanostructure gratings with a
period smaller than d = 44 nm will not improve atom
beam interferometer gyroscopes or accelerometers unless
the vdW limitation is overcome. This limitation can be
circumvented somewhat if large open fractions are used,
or by choosing atom-surface combinations that have a
small vdW coeﬃcient C3, or by reducing the grating

thickness ℓ independently of d as shown in equation 24
or by adjusting atom velocity to maximize the ﬁgure of
merit shown in equation 31. Some of these advantages
could be realized if gratings were fabricated from an array
of carbon nanotubes.

In conclusion, we have shown how atom interferome-
ters are aﬀected by vdW interactions between atoms and
nanostructure gratings. We have shown how to calcu-
late the contrast and intensity of the interference pat-
tern given the parameters: grating thickness (ℓ), grating
period (d), grating open fractions (wi/d), atom veloc-
ity (v), and vdW coeﬃcient (C3). We described how
to select open fractions that will optimize an interfer-
ometer for maximum sensitivity to interference fringe
phase shifts. For experiments with the currently avail-
able parameters (ℓ = 150 nm, d= 100 nm, v = 1000
m/s, C3 = 3 meVnm3), we report the open fractions
that minimize the uncertainty in phase (σφ) are given by
If the gratings
(w1/d, w2/d, w3/d) = (0.75, 0.67, 0.37).
are made with a period smaller than d = 50 nm, then re-
gardless of the open fractions, the statistical sensitivity
to phase shifts (given by the uncertainty σφ) will grow be-
cause of the way vdW interactions adversely aﬀect how
the gratings operate as beam splitters. For maximum
sensitivity to rotation or acceleration, there is a mini-
mum grating period in the range of 40 nm. Thus van
der Waals interactions place a limitation on the smallest
nanostructure gratings that can be used for atom inter-
ferometry.

Abstract

We investigate two-photon double ionization of helium by intense (≈ 1015 W/cm2) ultrashort

(≈ 300 as) soft X-ray pulses (E = 91.6 eV). The time-dependent two-electron Schr¨odinger equa-

tion is solved using a coupled channel method. We show that for ultrashort pulses the angular

distribution of ejected electrons depends on the pulse duration and provides novel insights into the

role of electron correlations in the two-electron photoemission process. The angular distribution at

energies near the “independent electron” peaks is close to dipolar while it acquires in the “valley”

of correlated emission a signiﬁcant quadrupolar component within a few hundred attoseconds.

INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) techniques have led to the

development of soft X-ray sources that feature ultrashort pulses with pulse durations of a few

hundred attoseconds (as) [1] and may reach intensities (& 1014 W/cm2) that are capable of

inducing multiphoton processes. Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses (photon energy 27.9 eV)

with pulse duration of 950 as have been characterized with an autocorrelation technique

[2]. Recently, the two-photon double-ionization and above-threshold ionization of helium

were experimentally observed with the Ti:sapphire 27th harmonic pulses (photon energy

41.8 eV) [3]. These experimental advances open up the opportunity to revisit the dynamics

of double ionization of helium by XUV photons previously investigated only in the single-

photon absorption and scattering regime using synchrotron radiation [4, 5]. Simultaneous

ejection of two electrons by a single photon allowed detailed tests of wavefunctions for

the three-body Coulomb problem [6, 7, 8] and the role of electron correlations in strongly

inelastic processes accompanied with near-zero momentum transfer (photoabsorption) or

sizable momentum transfer (Compton scattering) [9, 10].

Multi-photon, in particular two-photon, ionization of helium by XUV pulses has been

studied theoretically by diﬀerent groups. A considerable numerical eﬀort has been made

to solve the two-active electron time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) with various

methods. The R-matrix Floquet theory was successful to describe the (2γ,2e) process of

He [11] in the photon energy range between where absorption of two photons are necessary

for double ionization. The conﬁguration interaction B-spline spectral method [12, 13] was

applied to solve the TDSE for this problem. The products of two B-splines represent the

radial part of the wavefunction which allows the inclusion of the electron-electron interaction

to a high degree of accuracy. Colgan et al. [14] developed a time-dependent coupled chan-

nel method and studied the complete fragmentation of helium at 45 eV photon energy and

presented fully diﬀerential cross sections. Recently Lambropoulos et al. [15] found a “knee”

structure in the intensity dependence reminiscent of a similar knee shape for double ioniza-

tion by strong IR pulses [16]. Photons above the double ionization threshold (ωxuv > 2.9
a.u. or 79 eV) were considered by Parker et al.

[17] who performed the direct numerical

integration of the two-electron TDSE with a mixed ﬁnite-diﬀerence/basis set approach on

a lattice and studied double-ionization with 87 eV photon energy pulses with a laser peak

2

intensity around 1016 W/cm2. They analyzed both sequential as well as non-sequential dou-

ble ionization events by a varying number of absorbed photons for long pulses (τp & 2 fs).

Most recently, Ishikawa and Midorikawa [18] investigated two-photon double ionization by

ultrashort pulses with durations of τp ≈ 150 to 450 as pertinent to HHG sources. They

identiﬁed an “anomalous” component in the electron spectrum in between the two peaks

associated with sequential double ionization and discussed its possible origin in terms of

post-ionization energy exchange and core relaxation eﬀects.

In this paper, we theoretically investigate two-photon double ionization of helium by

ultrashort attosecond pulses as a function of time by solving the TDSE with our coupled

channel method which has been originally developed for heavy-ion helium collisions [19, 20,

21] and later implemented to describe laser-driven atomic processes and two-photon coherent

control [22]. We consider experimentally realized high intensity laser pulses with 13.5 nm

wavelength [23] which are the 59th harmonic of a Ti:sapphire laser (wavelength 800 nm).

The photon energy considered (91.6 eV) is larger than the double ionization threshold of He

(79 eV). A single photon is thus suﬃcient to induce double ionization. This case has been

studied in detail with weak-ﬁeld synchrotron sources where multi-photon eﬀects are absent.

Because one photon can interact with one electron only, double ionization cannot occur

without electron-electron interaction. The picture is that one electron is directly ionized by

absorbing the photon, and the second electron leaves through electron correlation either in

the initial or in the ﬁnal state, or both. This has been discussed in terms of a shake-oﬀ and

electron-electron scattering (often referred to as TS1 [24]).

In contrast, for intense ﬁelds considered here, there is suﬃcient photon ﬂux such that

two photons can be absorbed, one by each electron, and the pair of electrons is ejected.

Electron correlation is therefore not a prerequisite for double ionization to occur. At the

same time, the ponderomotive energy of the XUV pulse EP = 8πI/4cω2

xuv is so small that
ionization by the rescattering of the ﬁrst ionized and accelerated electron that causes “non-

sequential” double ionization by strong IR pulses [25, 26] can be ruled out. We discuss the

conceptual diﬃculties in applying notions of sequential and non-sequential double ionization

to such short pulses. We show that the angular distribution provides detailed insights into

the ionization process on the attosecond time scale. The role electron correlation plays in

this process can be identiﬁed.

II. SCENARIO FOR TWO-PHOTON DOUBLE IONIZATION BY ATTOSECOND

XUV PULSES: TIME SEQUENCE AND CORRELATION

We consider a linearly polarized attosecond XUV pulse with a Gaussian envelope,

F (t) = F0 exp

−2 ln 2

cos(ωxuvt)ez ,

(cid:20)

t2
τ 2
p (cid:21)

(1)

where τp is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the pulse intensity. The center

frequency ωxuv corresponds to a Ti:sapphire 59th harmonic pulse with the energy of 91.6

eV. Following Ref. [18] we will consider pulse durations τp = 150 as and 450 as corresponding
to τp = 6.25 and τp = 18.7 a.u. The period of the XUV cycle is T = 2π/ωxuv ∼= 1.9 a.u.
The XUV pulse (Eq. 1) subtends only few cycles (3 to 10) and therefore closely resembles

few-cycle optical or near-IR pulses. The signiﬁcant Fourier broadening therefore precludes

the appearance of spectrally sharp photoionization peaks. There is, however, a fundamental

diﬀerence to optical pulses of the same intensity: even at an intensity of I = 1015 W/cm2,

the quiver amplitude of a free electron,

scale. Likewise, the ponderomotive energy EP = 8πI/4cω2

xuv ≈ 0.01 a.u. is small on an atomic
xuv ≈ 0.0006 a.u. is negligibly
small. Therefore, ionization takes place deep in the (multi) photon regime rather than in the

p

8πI/c/ω2

tunnel ionization regime applicable to IR pulses of the same intensity. This diﬀerence has

immediate consequences for the notion of “(non) sequential” ionization. While for tunnel

ionization the time window ∆t of an individual ionization “burst” can be uniquely identiﬁed

near the ﬁeld maxima with sub-cycle precision [27], the multi-photon ionization event is

intrinsically delocalized in time over several cycles. Only then does the electron response

to an electromagnetic pulse mimic that of photon absorption. In view of the fact that the

entire XUV pulse duration τp subtends only a few cycles, it is obvious that the notion of

sequentiality of ionization events loses its meaning in the present case. This is in sharp

contrast to intense ﬁeld ionization by optical ﬁelds. There, the ﬁrst ionization by tunnel

ionization under the inﬂuence of a quasi-classical electric ﬁeld is well localized and separated

in time from the collisional ionization of the second electron upon rescattering. The observed

scaling with the pulse duration ∝ τ N

p , where N is the number of photons absorbed, should

therefore not be taken as evidence of (non) sequentiality but a measure of the total energy

absorbed from the radiation ﬁeld during τp. The uncertainty in time when the absorption

process takes place or time delocalization of the multi-photon processes does not imply that

4

all time-diﬀerential information on the ionization process is averaged out, as will be shown

below.

period

The time characterizing the pulse duration should be compared to the time scale of the

electronic motion. Using the approximate hydrogenic expression for the classical orbital

τ0 = 2πn3/Z 2

ef f ,

(2)

the orbital period ranges between τ0 = 40 as (= 1.6 a.u.)
He+(1s)(Zef f = 2) and, for the “outer” electron of He (1s2) with a binding energy of

for the “inner” electron of

24.6 eV (Zef f = 1.3), τ0 = 90 as (≈ 4 a.u.). The cycle period T and the orbital period

are comparable to each other, thus probing the electronic motion on the time scale on

which the two interacting electrons of the helium ground state exchange energy, linear and

angular momentum. Thus, double ionization by attosecond XUV pulses may probe electron

correlations in both initial and ﬁnal states.

The role of correlation in double photoionization of helium is a well-established subject in

the low-intensity or single-photon limit of XUV radiation going back to the pioneering paper

by Byron and Joachain [28]. As the electron-photon interaction is a one-body operator,

single-photon absorption can directly eject only one electron. Ejecting a second electron

requires with necessity electron-electron interaction. The latter does not, however, imply

correlation eﬀects. Adhering here and in the following to the identiﬁcation of correlation

with those pieces of the interaction not included in a mean-ﬁeld or independent particle (IP)

model as embodied in the (single conﬁguration) Hartree-Fock description [24], one-photon

double ionization can proceed via mean-ﬁeld contribution. Already the sudden change of

the screening following the ejection of the ﬁrst electron generates a ﬁnite probability of

ejecting a second electron. This “shake-oﬀ” process accounts for about 40 % of the total

doble ionization cross sections at high photon energies. Clearly, for a quantitatively accurate

description, in particular over the entire range of photon energies from threshold to high

energies [8] correlation eﬀects beyond the mean ﬁeld in both the initial and ﬁnal states are

essential.

For two-photon double ionization by XUV pulses with ωxuv > 2 a.u. dominance of

independent particle (IP) ionization is expected since each reaction

(4)

where n and l are the principal and angular momentum quantum numbers of He+, respec-

tively, is energetically allowed for all n. The quantum numbers, n = 1 and l = 0 are expected

to dominate in Eqs. (3,4). Thus, correlation eﬀects appear to be unimportant for the two-

photon process. It should be noted that the picture of a chain of reactions each satisfying

energy conservation in the photoelectric eﬀect separately, invoked by Eqs. (3, 4) is only

meaningful for τp → ∞. In this limit, Eqs. (3,4) implies an electron spectrum in coinci-
dence with He++ (displayed schematically in Fig. 1) with two Rydberg series symmetrically

centered around the energy

ES = ωxuv − (I1 + I2)/2 = 52 eV

(5)

The single-photon double ionization spectrum well-known from synchrotron-studies appears

as a continuum below 12.6 eV (ωxuv − I1 − I2). Its two-photon replica would set in above

E = ωxuv = 91.6 eV. For ultrashort τp all discrete peaks get dramatically broadened and

merge into a quasi-continuum.

Apart from the broadening, the limit of short τp has further consequences when this time

becomes comparable to the electronic correlation time τC in the helium ground state which

6

can be simply estimated from the characteristic time for collisional exchange of energy and

angular momentum between two classical electrons. Alternatively, it can be estimated from

the correlation energy EC = E − EHF as τC = 1/EC. In either cases, τC is of the order 10

a.u. (or 200 as). XUV pulses with periods T of 2 a.u. and durations of 3 - 10 a.u. therefore

can probe the correlation dynamics.

FIG. 2: Schematic interaction diagrams for two-photon absorption from He ground state. (a)

Each electron absorbs one photon each; (b) one electron absorbs two photons. Dashed lines denote

the electron-electron interactions.

It is instructive to visualize the two-photon double ionization process diagrammatically

(Fig. 2). The two photon lines each representing the one-body operator of photoabsorption

end either at the same or at two diﬀerent electrons resulting in two diﬀerent diagrams. (The

line representing the nucleus has been omitted for simplicity). It should be noted that a

deﬁnite time ordering of the vertices of electron-photon interactions is neither implied non

meaningful for ultrashort pulses in light of the discussion above. The dashed lines refer to

electron-electron interaction in the initial and ﬁnal states which lead to energy and angular

momentum exchange. The latter is reﬂected in a conﬁguration-interaction wavefunction in

terms of admixtures of orbitals of diﬀerent single-particle angular momenta,

Typical orders of magnitude of admixture coeﬃcients for the initial state are [28] (see also

Eq. (15) below) |ap/as| . 0.1, |ad/as| . 0.01 and those of higher l are exceedingly small.

The admixture of non-s orbitals to the He ground state provides a unique signature of

electron correlation as it would be absent in an IP or HF model. More precisely, l 6=
0 conﬁgurations represent angular correlation while coeﬃcients a(i,j)

s may contain radial

correlation. Correspondingly, angular momentum components in the ﬁnal state reﬂect both

the angular momentum transfer ∆l = ±1 by photoabsorption as well as the non-s admixtures

due to electron correlations in the initial and ﬁnal state. Their presence can be mapped out

by the time-dependence of the angular distribution of ejected electrons.

III. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

We have calculated the double ionization by two-photon absorption represented by the

diagrams of Fig. 2 using our time-dependent coupled-channel method. The point to be

noted is that while we discuss and interpret our results within to lowest-order perturbation

theory (LOPT), the calculation is fully non-perturbative taking into account electron-photon

and electron-electron interactions to all orders, albeit within a truncated basis. Brieﬂy, we

calculate ionization process of the helium atom in the laser pulse by solving the TDSE

equation

ˆHΦj(r1, r2) = EjΦj(r1, r2),

to yield

Ψ(r1, r2, t) =

where the aj(t) are the time-dependent expansion coeﬃcients and Ej are the eigenvalues

of (Eq. 10). Inserting (Eq. 11) into the TDSE (Eq. 7) leads to the system of ﬁrst-order

The ionization probability can be retrieved from Pk which includes discretized channels

representing the continuum formed by the wave packets. The equations of coupled channels

(Eq. 12) are solved by a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg integrator of order ﬁve with automatic time

In the following we restrict ourselves to singlet helium states only. The two-particle functions

are made up of symmetrized single particle orbitals, gǫl(r)Y m

consist of radial Slater functions and radial regular Coulomb wave packets. We note that
the coeﬃcients b[j]

µ are related to the admixture coeﬃcients discussed earlier following Eq.

(6). The wave packets form a discrete representation of the Coulomb continuum and can

serve as building blocks of our ﬁnite basis [19, 20].

We include single-particle wavefunctions with 0 ≤ l1, l2 ≤ 2 angular momenta and couple

them to 0 ≤ L ≤ 2 total angular momentum two-electron states. For the L = 0 conﬁgura-

tions we use ss+pp+dd angular correlated wavefunctions, for L = 1 we use sp+pd couplings

and for L = 2 the sd + pp + dd conﬁgurations, respectively. Since already the contribution

of d orbitals in the present case is found to be small, higher li can be safely neglected. The

angular correlated contributions play an essential role to understanding the angular distri-

bution of the ionized electrons. In order to determine the ﬁnal electronic state population,

FIG. 3: Energy distribution of the ejected electrons in two-photon double-ionization of He. The

peak intensity of the pulse is 1015 W/cm2 and the pulse duration is τp=450 as. The solid line

represents our results and the dashed line represents the data for Ishikawa et al. [18]. The energy

positions referred to in text are 37.2 eV (a), 52 eV (b), and 67 eV (c).

Before analyzing the angular distribution from Eq. (17) we brieﬂy present results for

the energy distribution for which a direct comparison with a recent calculation by Ishikawa

and Midorikawa [18] is possible. The single electron energy distribution integrated over the

second electron for the pulse duration of 450 as (Fig. 3) features two prominent peaks which

can be easily identiﬁed with help of Fig. 1 as the ionization spectra following the reactions

Eqs. (3 and 4). The dominant yet strongly broadened peak at 67 eV (labeled c) is due to

electrons ejected from the ground state of He with the ﬁrst ionization potential of I1 = 24.6

eV. In the second interaction, the electrons are ejected from the He+ ion with an ionization

potential of I2 = 54.4 eV, yielding the peak at 91.6 − I2 = 37.2 eV (labeled a). From the

higher members or the Rydberg series only n = 2 peaks are identiﬁable in Fig. 3 as local

humps, one just below and one above the main peaks, respectively. Structures from n ≥ 3

are not visible since their contributions become exceedingly small. The cross section of the

single-photon double ionization continuum below 12.6 eV (see Fig. 1) is by far too small to

be visible on a linear scale. The peaks a and c (Fig. 3) have been previously referred to as

sequential ionization [18] or above-threshold ionization [17]. We will refer to this process

as independent particle (IP) ionization to stress that electron correlation eﬀects play no

signiﬁcant role in their occurrence. This is in striking contrast to the spectral feature in

the “valley” (labeled b) (also referred to as anomalous component [18]) in which correlation

eﬀects are of crucial importance. We refer to this feature as “correlation induced” (CI)

ionization.

The dependence of the CI ionization on the pulse duration τp is illustrated in Fig. 4 for

an ultrashort pulse of 150 as. The valley is now quite shallow and a signiﬁcant fraction

of the ionization probability is contained in the “valley”. This is, in the ﬁrst place, an

obvious consequence of the increased Fourier broadening in the ultrashort pulse limit. In

the opposite limit τp ≫ T and τp ≫ τ0, the spectrum is expected to revert to the quasi-

discrete line spectrum, schematically depicted in Fig. 1. Only in the long-pulse limit, the

notions of time ordering or sequentiality of the process takes on physical meaning. Overall,

our data agree with those of Ref. [18] remarkably well on an absolute scale with the largest

discrepancies in the wings of the peak for the 10 cycle pulse (450 as).

(from inside going outward) after the pulse’s rise to half maximum, for energies 37 eV (left) and
52 eV (right). The unit circle indicates intensities of 7 × 10−6 eV−1 for (a) and 6 × 10−7 eV−1 for

(b). The arrows show the polarization axis.

The identiﬁcation of the valley region near Es with correlated ionization is, in the ﬁrst

instance, taken over from one-photon double ionization by synchrotron radiation where

the region of symmetric energy sharing of the available photon energy is dominated by

correlation eﬀects [24]. The extension of this identiﬁcation to two-photon absorption can

be quantitatively justiﬁed by the properties of the angular distribution, as shown below.

Were the valley simply the result of the Fourier broadening of two IP peaks, the distribution

PDI(θ) at the energies near (ES) should closely resemble those of the spectral regions (a) or

12

(c). That this is not at all the case is illustrated by the polar plot (Fig. 5) of the angular

distribution near the IP ionization peak (a) and the CI ionization valley (b). The diﬀerent

contour line indicates the time evolution of the angular distribution in increments of 50 as

for the 450 as pulse. While the IP peak retains the emission pattern of a Hertz dipole during

the entire pulse duration, the CI electron distribution takes on a pronounced non-dipolar,

i.e. quadrupolar, pattern after about 150 as. The onset of a non-dipolar distribution on this

timescale can be also observed for the ultrashort pulse of τp = 150 as (Fig. 6) indicating that

the sharp diﬀerences in the angular distribution between the IP peak and the CI component

is also present when the valley is very shallow. For the ultrashort pulse a slight peak shift

from 37 eV to about 39 eV is found in agreement with Ref. [18].

where σ0 is the integral cross section, P2,4 are the Legendre polynomials, and β and γ are

the second order (k = 2) and fourth-order (k = 4) anisotropy parameters, respectively.

Note that a “dipolar” emission pattern has k = 2, i.e., it represents “alignment”, while

the “quadrupolar” pattern is of rank k = 4 and should be more correctly referred to as

“hexadecapole”.

Individually, the range of the multipole parameters are −1 ≤ β ≤ 2,

13

and −1 ≤ γ ≤ 7/3, the highest order of anisotropy k = 4 is consistent with two-photon

absorption,

k ≤ 2N .

(19)

Higher anisotropy coeﬃcients beyond k = 4 are not detectable. By projecting the numer-

ically calculated angular distributions to Eq. (18), we obtain the β and the γ parameters

listed in Table 1. Near the IP ionization peaks, (37 and 39 eV for 450 and 150 as pulses,

respectively) β is at least one order of magnitude larger than γ. The β values are very close

to their maximum value of 2.

At 52 eV, near the CI valley, β and γ become comparable, giving rise to a strong mixing

of dipole and quadrupole terms in the angular distributions.

It should be noted that the present deviation from a strictly aligned (k = 2) pattern is due

to multiphoton eﬀects and not due to retardation eﬀects beyond the dipole approximation

[29]. Figs. 5 and 6 clearly show that two-photon IP ionization features a near Hertz dipole

distribution while CI ionization possess a signiﬁcant k = 4 admixture. It is now instructive

to relate the origin of the quadrupole component to correlations. A non-vanishing γ requires

a ﬁnal state in the continuum with Lf = 2 since k = 2Lf . The latter results from coupling
of conﬁgurations involving single-particle orbitals, (lf , l′

f ) : (sf df ), (pf pf ) and (df df ), where

the latter is already negligible at the present intensity. By selectively switching oﬀ ﬁnal

states consisting of (sf df ) and (pf pf ) conﬁgurations we ﬁnd that the IP ionization peak is

dominated by (pf pf ) orbitals while the CI ionization contribution is dominated by (sf df )

contributions. These ﬁnal states can be reached by absorption of two photons along the

14

LOPT pathways that correspond to either diagram (Fig. 2b)

While the ﬁrst path (Eq. (20a)) can be realized for the dominant conﬁguration in the initial

state (si, si) (see Eq. 5)) and would be present for an uncorrelated initial state described by

e.g. HF wavefunction, the second path (20b) has as prerequisite conﬁguration admixtures

(pi, pi) to the initial state and thus initial-state angular correlation. When selectively elim-

inating the (pi, pi) conﬁguration from the initial state we ﬁnd that the cross section in the

valley region is reduced by almost an order of magnitude. This unambiguously characterizes

the “anomalous” cross section component in the “valley” as being due to correlations. By

contrast, the IP ionization peaks are barely aﬀected when (pipi) conﬁgurations are removed.

This is plausible as the dominant two-photon absorption process from an uncorrelated initial

state according to Fig. 2a

predicts a dominance of a Hertz dipole pattern for each ejected electron. Our calculations

suggests that initial-state correlations may be more important than ﬁnal-state correlations.

This is due to the fact that the pair of electrons near the symmetric energy sharing point

Es = 52 eV leave the interaction region quickly with a relatively large speed of v = 2 a.u.

Ishikawa et al.

[18] have discussed the “anomalous” component in terms of two semi-

classical models. Post-ionization energy exchange (PIEE) and second ionization during core

relaxation (SICR). They found that PIEE is ineﬃcient to account for the valley region

consistent with our observation that ﬁnal-state correlations are of minor importance. On

the other hand the relaxation process due to change in screening in the SICR appears to

resemble somewhat a shake process and is as a quasi-isotropic process unlikely to yield a

high-order (k = 4) anisotropy.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the electron energy and angular distributions in two-photon double-

ionization of He by an attosecond, intense soft X-ray pulse, speciﬁcally, for the Ti:sapphire

15

59th harmonic pulse with an intensity of 1015 W/cm2. We solved the TDSE with our coupled

channel method in which the electron-electron interaction is fully taken into account.

The electron energy distributions show well-localized peaks for pulse of long duration

τp. They are understood to arise from the independent particle (IP) ionization. For short

pulses of only a few hundred attoseconds, the peaks shift toward each other and the cross

section in the valley between the peaks becomes signiﬁcant. We attribute this ionization

component to the correlation-induced (CI) ionization. We investigated the electron angular

distributions from IP and CI ionization. We ﬁnd shape proﬁles to be that of a Hertz dipole

for IP ionization but a signiﬁcant admixture of a k = 4 (“quadrupole”) components for CI

ionization. The unique signature of correlation-induced ionization is the presence of this

k = 4 component in the angular shape proﬁles. They were further quantiﬁed in terms of the

multipole expansion parameters.

Time evolution of the electron angular distribution suggests that sequentiality of electron

ejection or photon absorption is neither relevant nor well-deﬁned. Clearly, further studies

are needed to clarify electron correlation eﬀects. Joint energy-angular distributions (i.e.,

kinematically complete momentum distributions) would provide new insight into the ion-

ization mechanism. It would also be useful to understand the ionization with the help of

a perturbative approach, either with the electron-electron interaction or the pulse inten-

sity as the expansion parameter. This would provide a complementary picture to various

mechanisms that may be diﬃcult to identify in fully numerical TDSE results.

We present the ﬁrst formulation and application of relativistic unitary coupled cluster theory to
atomic properties. The remarkable features of this theory are highlighted, and it is used to calculate
the lifetimes of 52D3/2 and 62P3/2 states of Ba+ and P b+ respectively. The results clearly suggest
that it is very well suited for accurate ab initio calculations of properties of heavy atomic systems.

There have been a number of attempts to modify
coupled-cluster (CC) theory [1], despite its spectacular
success in elucidating the properties of a wide range of
many-body systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. One interesting case in
point is unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) theory which was
ﬁrst proposed by Kutzelnigg [6]. In this theory, the eﬀec-
tive Hamiltonian is Hermitian by construction and the
energy which is the expectation value of this operator
in the reference state is unlike in CC theory, an upper
bound to the ground state energy [5]. Another attrac-
tive feature of this theory which we shall discuss later
is that at a given level of approximation it incorporates
certain higher order excitations that are not present in
CC theory. Furthermore, it is well suited for the cal-
culation of properties where core relaxation eﬀects are
important [7, 8]. In spite of the aforementioned advan-
tages, there have been relatively few studies based on this
method [9, 10]. This work is the ﬁrst relativistic formu-
lation of unitary coupled cluster (UCC) theory and also
the ﬁrst application of this theory to atomic properties.
In this letter, we ﬁrst present the formal aspects of rel-
ativistic UCC theory and then apply it to calculate the
lifetimes of the 52D3/2 and 62P3/2 states of Ba+ and P b+
respectively; which depend strongly on both relativistic
and correlation eﬀects. The comparison of the results of
these calculations with accurate experimental data would
constitute an important test of this theory.

The exact wave function for a closed shell state in CC
theory is obtained by the action of the operator exp(T )
on the reference state |Φi. However, in UCC theory [10],
it is written as

|Ψi = exp(σ) |Φi

(1)

where σ = T − T †; and T and T † are the excitation
and deexcitation operators respectively. σ is clearly anti-
Hermitian, since σ† = −σ. Using this unitary ansatz for
the correlated wave function, the relativistic UCC equa-

tion in the Dirac-Coulomb approximation can be written
as

exp(σ†)H exp(σ) |Φi = E |Φi ,
where H is the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian

H =

Using the normal ordered Hamiltonian, Eq.(2) can be

rewritten as

exp(σ†)HN exp(σ) |Φi = ∆E |Φi ,

(4)

where the normal ordered Hamiltonian is deﬁned as
HN = H − hΦ| H |Φi and ∆E = E − hΦ| H |Φi. .

The choice of the operator σ makes the eﬀective Hamil-

tonian H N = exp(−σ)HN exp(σ) Hermitian.

The eﬀective Hamiltonian is expressed by the Haus-

dorﬀ expansion in CC theory as

H N = exp(−T )HN exp(T )

= HN + [HN , T ] +

In UCC, the operator T is replaced by σ = T − T † in the
above equation and this results in H N being expressed
in terms of a non-terminating series of commutators. For
practical reasons, one truncates the series after some ﬁ-
nite order. Truncation at the n-th order commutator
leads to the nomenclature UCC(n).

Using UCC(3 ) approximation and without modifying

the last term of Eq. (5), we write Eq. (4) as

By projecting single, double and higher order excited
determinant states on Eq.(6), we get the cluster ampli-
tude equations. The approximation which includes only
single and double excitations/deexcitations in the UCC
wavefunction is known as UCCSD. After careful analysis,
one ﬁnds that there are new terms arising from T †HN T ,
T †T †HN T and T †HN T T in the UCCSD equations. The
ﬁrst term will give rise to some extra diagrams which cor-
respond to double and triple excitations and the last two
terms to triple and quadrupole excitations. Some typical
diagrams which represent triple and quadrupole excita-
tions are given in ﬁgures 1a and 1b respectively. The
UCCSD approximation in addition to single and dou-
ble excitations, also includes some triple and quadrupole
excitations to all orders in the residual Coulomb inter-
action in a more elegant and simpler manner compared
to CC theory. It would have been computationally pro-
hibitive to include triple and quadrupole excitations for
heavy atoms in the framework of normal CC theory. In-
deed one of the principal advantages of UCC theory is its
ability to subsume higher levels of excitations than CC
theory at the same level of approximation.

To calculate the ground state of the system we
ﬁrst compute the cluster amplitude of the closed shell
states(Ba++ and P b++) by using Eq.(6) and then use
the open shell coupled cluster method (OSCC)[11]. The
exact wave function can then be written as

orbital energies. The above amplitudes are added ap-
propriately in the singles and doubles open shell clus-
ter amplitude equations and they are then solved self-
consistently. We therefore obtain solutions of S1 and S2
amplitudes taking into consideration the partial eﬀect of
the triple excitations. We had referred to this approxi-
mation earlier as CCSD(T).

As we have seen in Eq.(6), H N is deﬁned as H N =
exp(−σ)HN exp(σ). From Eq.(5) it is clear that the the
expansion of H N corresponding to UCC theory can be
expressed as

H N = (H N )CCSD + (H N )extra.

(11)

Following much the same argument as in the closed shell
case, it can be shown that the contributions from the ex-
tra part arising in Eq.(11) contains terms like T †HN T ,
T †T †HN T and T †HN T T . These terms will aﬀect the
open-shell amplitude determining equations. In the UCC
theory for the closed shell, we have seen that although
there are some extra terms arising from the expansion of
H N , the contributing diagrams corresponding to those
terms are not always new. Hence we have taken into ac-
count those diagrams which are not present in the CCSD
approximation.
It can be shown that the extra terms
arising from the inclusion on the operator σ = T − T †
give rise to some new terms but the corresponding dia-
grams have already been taken into account through the

The results of the calculations of the lifetimes of the
52D3/2 state of Ba+ and 62P3/2 state of P b+ are given
in tables II and III respectively. These calculations are

very challenging as they involve accurate determinations
of the line strengths of the M 1 and E2 transitions and
more critically the third and ﬁfth powers of the excitation
energies.

The lifetime of the 52D3/2 state of Ba+ is calculated
using hybrid orbitals consisting of single particle orbitals
which are partly numerical and partly analytical. Such
an approach is described in detail by Majumder et al
[18]. The analytical orbitals are Gaussian type orbitals
(GTOs). The details of this basis are given in table I.

Excitations from all the core orbitals are included for
this ion as well as P b+. Since the calculation of transi-
tion probabilities/lifetimes are extremely sensitive to the
excitation energies. Gopakumar et al [14] have shown
that the hybrid basis can serve this purpose very well.
Our UCCSD(T) calculations yield ionization potentials
(IPs) to an accuracy of about 0.1%, and 0.07% for the
62S1/2 and 52D3/2 states of Ba+ respectively. The cor-
responding IP (in cm−1) values are 80544 (80687) and
75755 (75813). The numbers in the parentheses are the
corresponding experimental values [19].

The values of the calculated and experimental lifetimes
are given in table II. Dzuba et al [15], Guet et al [16]
and Gopakumar et al [14] have not considered the M 1
channel in their calculations. Gopakumar et al have
used CCSD(T), but Guet et al and Dzuba et al have
used diﬀerent variants of many-body perturbation the-
ory (MBPT) with certain semi-empirical features to cal-
culate the transition amplitudes. In addition, the latter
two have used experimental values of the excitation en-
ergies to calculate the transition probabilities/lifetimes.
Our calculation based on UCCSD(T) is purely ab ini-
tio and takes into account the contribution of the M 1
transition. The transition amplitude in this approach
includes some terms in addition to those that appear in

4

CCSD(T); and they arise due to the presence of the deex-
citation operator in the UCC wavefunction. The result of
the lifetime calculation considering only the E2 channel
is 85.567. Inclusion of the M 1 transition improves the to-
tal value (81.01 s) which is within the experimental error
bar (79±4.6 s).

The UCCSD(T) calculations of lifetime for the 62P3/2
state of P b+ are carried out using the same basis func-
tions used by Sahoo et al [13]. The leading correlation
contribution to the M 1 and E2 channel come from the
core polarization and pair correlation eﬀects. It is evident
from Table III that the accuracy of the calculation of ex-
citation energies using UCCSD(T) is even better than
that obtained from CCSD(T). This result and the im-
provements in the M 1 and E2 transition amplitudes due
to the UCC formulation coupled together give a value
of the lifetime of the 62P3/2 state of P b+ that is clearly
in better agreement with the corresponding CCSD(T)
calculation. This value is within the limits of the exper-
imental error [20], but this is not the case for CCSD(T).
In summary, we have applied the relativistic UCC the-
ory for the ﬁrst time to atomic properties. The results of
our UCCSD(T) calculations of the lifetimes of the 52D3/2
and 62P3/2 states of Ba+ and P b+ respectively are in
very good agreement with experiment and superior to
those of all previous calculations. It indeed appears that
this theory is capable of yielding high precision results for
a wide range of properties of heavy atomic systems in-
cluding violation of parity and time-reversal symmetries.
In addition, it would be worthwhile to explore its feasi-
bility for the accurate determination of the properties of
other many-body systems, particularly when it becomes
necessary to go beyond the usual coupled cluster theory.

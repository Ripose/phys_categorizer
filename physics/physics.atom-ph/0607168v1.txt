Abstract

We present quantum mechanical close-coupling calculations of collisions between two hydrogen

molecules over a wide range of energies, extending from the ultracold limit to the super-thermal

region. The two most recently published potential energy surfaces for the H2-H2 complex, the

so-called DJ (Diep and Johnson, 2000) and BMKP (Boothroyd et al., 2002) surfaces, are quan-

titatively evaluated and compared through the investigation of rotational transitions in H2+H2

collisions within rigid rotor approximation. The BMKP surface is expected to be an improve-

ment, approaching chemical accuracy, over all conformations of the potential energy surface com-

pared to previous calculations of H2-H2 interaction. We found signiﬁcant diﬀerences in rotational

excitation/de-excitation cross sections computed on the two surfaces in collisions between two para-

H2 molecules. The discrepancy persists over a large range of energies from the ultracold regime

to thermal energies and occurs for several low-lying initial rotational levels. Good agreement is

found with experiment (Mat´e et al., 2005) for the lowest rotational excitation process, but only

with the use of the DJ potential. Rate coeﬃcients computed with the BMKP potential are an

order of magnitude smaller.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Collisions involving two hydrogen molecules are of great interest for three main reasons.

First, the H2+H2 collision system is a prototype for chemical dynamics studies and can

be used as a testing ground for scattering theory of inelastic (non-reactive) diatom-diatom

collisions involving a weak interaction potential. Second, H2 is the most abundant molec-

ular species in the universe. The rotational and vibrational transitions in H2 induced by

collisions with its twin are of practical importance in models of astrophysical environments

where the physical conditions may not be accessible to terrestrial experiments. Examples in-

clude low densities characteristic of giant molecular clouds in the interstellar medium where

star formation occurs and H2 may act as a coolant1. Heating of the interstellar cloud by

strong shock waves induces rotational and vibrational excitation of the H2 molecules leading

to collision-induced dissociation to two free H atoms2 and photodissociation regions where

H2 is exposed to strong UV stellar radiation3. Third, with recent experimental advances
in the cooling and trapping of molecules4,5,6,7 to form molecular Bose-Einstein condensates,

collisional studies of the H2+H2 system can serve as a model to provide new insights into

the behavior of diatom-diatom collisions at ultracold temperatures including investigations

of Feshbach resonances, predissociation in van der Waals complexes, determination of com-

plex scattering lengths, testing of eﬀective range theory and Wigner threshold laws, and

quasiresonant vibration-rotation energy transfer8,9,10,11,12 in molecular collisions.

Since (H2)2 is the simplest 4-identical-particle closed shell system and there is a con-

tinuing demand for accurate collisional data for modeling astrophysical, atmospheric and

combustion processes there have been considerable theoretical13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25

and experimental26,27,28,29,30,31 studies performed on the H2+H2 system. The most recent
experiment was performed by Mat´e and co-workers31. Using the technique of Raman spec-

troscopy with supersonic expansions of para-H2, they measured the rate coeﬃcient, k00→20,
for H2(j1 = 0) + H2(j2 = 0) → H2(j′

2 = 0) collisions in the temperature range
of 2 to 110 K. With their experimental methodology, without the loss of generality, the

1 = 2) + H2(j′

reduction of the measured k00→20 rate coeﬃcient to the corresponding cross section, σ00→20
in the collision energy range of 360 to 600 cm−1 was made possible. To complement the ex-
perimental measurement, Mat´e et al.31 also performed coupled channel quantum scattering

calculations to determine the σ00→20 excitation cross section as a function of the collision

energy. Good agreement was found between the experimentally-derived cross sections and

theoretical results obtained using the rigid rotor potential energy surface (PES) developed

by Diep and Johnson (DJ)32.

The most recent theoretical study of rotational excitation in H2+H2 collisions was car-

ried out by Gatti and co-workers33. They employed the wave-packet propagation method

in conjunction with the multiconﬁguration time-dependent Hartree algorithm to compute

rotational excitation cross sections for collision energies up to 1.2 eV by a ﬂux analysis of

the interaction of the wave-packet with a complex absorbing potential. Gatti et al. com-

pared their results with the wave packet calculations of Lin and Guo34 who employed the

coupled-states (CS) approximation which neglects Coriolis coupling. They found that the

CS approximation can lead to rather reliable predictions provided the calculations are per-

formed at low collision energies and low rotational excitations. However, without the aid

of accurate molecular potential curves, it is diﬃcult to determine in which energy regime

the Coriolis coupling takes eﬀect for a speciﬁc collision system. Both wave-packet calcula-

tions employed the PES constructed in 2002 by Boothroyd, Martin, Keogh, and Peterson35

(BMKP). While previous calculations18 have indicated that the CS approximation can give

accurate results for rotational excitation in H2 at low energies, these calculations have used

rather simple potential functions for the H4 system.

The purpose of this study is to perform accurate close-coupling calculations of rotational

transitions in H2+H2 collisions within the ground vibrational state. Due to the relatively

large vibrational level spacings of the H2 molecule and the weak H2–H2 interaction poten-

tial, the rigid rotor approximation is expected to hold well for the present system for pure

rotational energy transfer. This is also conﬁrmed by the wave packet calculations of Lin

and Guo34. Here, we perform close-coupling calculations of rotational excitation on both

the DJ and the BMKP PESs and compare our results with the wave-packet results of Lin

and Guo and Gatti et al. So far, the accuracy of the BMKP PES has not been established

by comparing results from accurate quantum calculations with experimental results. Such

a comparison is provided here for both the DJ and BMKP PESs and we show that the rigid

rotor DJ potential yield results that are generally in better agreement with experiment.

We also investigate the behavior of elastic and rotationally inelastic collisions in diatom-

diatom collisions at ultracold energies by taking the H2+H2 system as an illustrative example.

While ultracold rotational and vibrational energy transfer in atom-diatom collisions have

extensively been reported8,9,10,11,12,36 in the last several years, such calculations are yet to

be performed on molecule-molecule collisions. Forrey12 has performed limited calculations

on H2+H2 collisions in the ultracold regime using the semi-empirical potential of Zarur and
Rabitz16 while Avdeenkov and Bohn37,38,39 reported spin-exchange collisions in O2+O2 and

OH+OH/OD+OD systems. Here, we provide a detailed investigation of rotational energy

transfer in H2+H2 collisions on the DJ and BMKP PESs at ultracold energies and report

complex scattering lengths for collisions involving diﬀerent initial rotational levels of the two

molecules.

The paper is organized as follows: A brief description of the theoretical methodology is

given in section II and results are presented in section III. Section IV provides summary
and conclusions. Atomic units are used throughout, unless otherwise noted: i.e., ~ = e =

me = ao = 1 a.u., while 1 hartree = 27.2116 eV = 627.51 kcal/mol.

II. THEORY

Calculations of state-to-state rotational transition cross sections and rate coeﬃcients can

provide an important test of the reliability of the potential energy surfaces describing the

interaction of two H2 molecules when compared to available experiments. To compute the

scattering amplitudes and hence the cross sections, we use well established quantum mechan-

ical close-coupling methods14,17,40,41. Here we only summarize the essence of the theory. To

describe the scattering process, we solve the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation within

rigid rotor approximation for the collision of two H2 molecules in the center of mass frame

III. RESULTS

We have carried out close-coupling calculations for collisions of H2 with H2 using the

BMKP and DJ PESs. The rigid rotor target and projectile energy levels were calculated
using a rotational constant of B = 60.853 cm−1 for the H2 molecule. To solve the coupled
radial equations (6), we used the hybrid modiﬁed log-derivative-Airy propagator43 in the

general purpose non-reactive scattering code MOLSCAT44. The log-derivative matrix43 is

propagated to large intermolecular separations where the numerical results are matched to

the known asymptotic solutions to extract the physical scattering matrix. This procedure is

carried out for each partial wave until a converged cross section is reached. We have checked

that the results are converged with respect to the number of partial waves as well as the

matching radius for all channels included in the calculations.

In addition to the partial wave convergence, based on the DJ PES, we have checked that

the results are converged with respect to various parameters that enter into the close-coupling

calculations. These include the number of quadrature points used for angular integration,

the number of terms in the angular expansion of interaction potential, and the asymptotic

matching radius for radial integration. In the ultracold regime, we used a matching radius

of Ro = 200–300 a.u. to obtain converged values of elastic and inelastic cross sections while

for the subthermal energy region, a matching radius of 50 a.u. was suﬃcient to yield results

of comparable accuracy. Similarly, we used 10 quadrature points each for integration along

angular coordinates θ1, θ2, and φ12.

Finally, two diﬀerent basis sets (22-state: j1j2 = 00, 20, 22, · · ·, 44 and 50-state: j1j2

= 00, 20, 22,· · ·, 66) were also employed to further test the convergence of our results. For

E < 1.0 eV, the two basis sets yield results within 1%, and at E = 1.0 eV, a similar degree

of accuracy was obtained for the dominant transitions. For weaker transitions such as 00
→ 44 rotational excitation, the small and large basis sets gave σ00→44 = 3.01×10−18 and
3.20×10−18 cm2, respectively, at 1.0 eV. Note that the cross sections for dominant transitions

are two orders of magnitude larger than the weaker ones. Even at E = 2.6 eV, the cross

sections obtained from both basis sets for the dominant transitions have similar convergence

properties as for E = 1.0 eV. However, for 00→44, we found that the larger basis set is

preferred since there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the cross sections (i.e., σ00→44 =
4.31×10−17 cm2 and 6.30×10−17 cm2, respectively, from the small and large basis sets, at

2.6 eV). Since our focus is on the low-energy region where the two basis sets yield similar

results, the smaller basis set is adopted throughout the calculations.

Fig. 1 shows the comparison between theoretical and experimental rate coeﬃcients for the

00→20 transition in the temperature range between 50 K and 300 K. Both experimental and

theoretical rate coeﬃcients indicate a precipitous drop for temperatures lower than 100 K.

Unexpectedly, we ﬁnd that the 00→20 excitation rate coeﬃcient computed with the BMKP

PES is about an order of magnitude smaller than that calculated with the PES of DJ and the

experiment, though both BMKP and DJ display the same trend. Only results from the DJ

PES agree with the experimental data of Mat´e et al.31 Good agreement between experiment

and theory based on the DJ PES was also shown by Mat´e et al.31. Further, the theoretical

results obtained by Flower21 using the older PES of Schwenke45 are also seen to be in good

agreement with experiment. The discrepancy with the BMKP results may directly be traced

to the weaker anisotropy of the BMKP PES responsible for the 00→20 transition. In the

calculations the angular dependence of the interaction potential is represented as32

V (R, θ1, θ2, φ12) =

Vl1,l2,l(R)Gl1,l2,l(θ1, θ2, φ12),

(12)

l1,l2,l
X

where Vl1,l2,l(R) are radial expansion coeﬃcients and Gl1,l2,l(θ1, θ2, φ12) are bispherical har-

monics. In Fig. 2 we compare the spherically symmetric (V000) and the leading anisotropic

terms, V022 = V202 and V224, in the angular expansion of the BMKP and DJ interaction

potentials as functions of the intermolecular separation. It is seen that while the spherically

symmetric part is nearly identical for both potentials, the main anisotropic term, V022 = V202,

responsible for the 00→20 rotational excitation is smaller for the BMKP potential at small

intermolecular separations. Our test calculations show that at energies lower than 0.1 eV,

the discrepancy between the two results is mostly due to small diﬀerences in the coupling

elements in the region of the van der Waals minimun, i.e., R > 3.0 au. The same also applies

to the next higher order term, V224. On the other hand, Progrebnya and Clary46 found that

the BMKP surface yields too high values for vibrational relaxation in H2(v = 1)+H2(v = 0)

collisions. They attributed this to higher-order anisotropic terms in the BMKP PES that
leads to preferential population of high rotational levels in the v′ = 0 level after quenching

(see Fig. 2 of the above reference). Calculations employing a modiﬁed version of the BMKP

potential in which only the ﬁrst two leading anisotropic terms of the interaction potential

shown in Fig. 2 are retained gave results in better agreement with the experiment.

The integral elastic cross sections of para-H2+para-H2 collisions as a function of collision

energy is plotted in Fig. 3(a) for both the BMKP and DJ potentials. In the zero-energy limit,

the elastic cross sections attain ﬁnite values in accordance with Wigner’s law. The limiting
value of the elastic cross section is 1.91 × 10−13 cm2 and 1.74 × 10−13 cm2 for the BMKP and

DJ PESs, respectively. The comparable values of the limiting elastic cross sections on the

two potentials is explained based on the nearly identical values for the spherically symmetric

part of the interaction potentials for both surfaces (see Fig. 2). Both potentials exhibit a

shape resonance at collision energies between 0.0002 and 0.0003 eV, arising from the l = 2

partial wave. At higher energies, cross sections on the two potentials exhibit an oscillatory

behaviour (see inset in the top panel of Fig. 3) which arises from interference between partial

cross sections corresponding to diﬀerent values of the total angular momentum quantum

number J. Note that only even values of J are allowed for p-H2–p-H2 collisions. Schaefer

and Meyer19 have provided a detailed analysis of the oscillatory behavior of the elastic cross

sections.

In Fig. 3(b) we compare elastic cross sections from the present work on the DJ and BMKP

surfaces with the theoretical results of Diep and Johnson32 and the experimental measure-

ment of Bauer et al.47. It is seen that the results on the DJ potential give slightly better

agreement with experimental data although the overall agreement between the experiment

and theory is generally good.

In Fig. 4 we compare cross sections from the present calculations on the BMKP surface

for the 00 → 20, 00 → 22 and 00 → 40 transitions with the wave packet results of Gatti et

al.33 and Lin and Guo34. The overall agreement between the CC and the wave-packet results

is rather good, to within 10–15% for all cross sections, except for the 00 → 22 rotational ex-

citation for which the present results are 30–50% larger. The signiﬁcant diﬀerences between

the present results and the wave packet results for this transition is somewhat surprising

considering the fact that the corresponding cross sections are about an order of magnitude

larger than the 00 → 40 transition for which we obtain good agreement with the wave packet

results. We are conﬁdent that this is not a numerical error in our calculations as we have

benchmarked our results against a new time-independent coupled channel code developed

by Krems48 which reproduces our results up to several signiﬁcant digits for all transitions

shown in Fig. 4. The deviation of the CS wave-packet results of Lin and Guo from the

present CC and full wave-packet data of Gatti et al. at higher energies may be attributed to

Coriolis couplings. This evidently suggests that Coriolis coupling plays an important role at

higher energies and that the rigid rotor approximation appears to hold well for this system

for collision energies investigated in the present work.

In Fig. 5(a), we compare rotational quenching cross sections for the 20 → 00 transition

evaluated using the BMKP and DJ potential with the 20 → 20 elastic scattering cross

section. Since the elastic scattering cross section on the two PESs is comparable, only the

result on the DJ potential is shown. The resonance feature that occurs in all three cross
sections just above 10−4 eV is due the l = 2 shape resonance discussed previously (See Fig.

1). It is seen that the inelastic cross sections are much smaller than the elastic one at all

energies shown in the Fig. 5(a). This suggests that it may be possible to cool rotationally

excited H2 molecules in the j = 2 rotational level by thermalizing collisions with ground

state H2 molecules (evaporative cooling) without signiﬁcant trap loss, though the absence of

an electric dipole moment makes it a diﬃcult system to handle experimentally. For incident
energies lower than 10−5 eV, the quenching cross section varies inversely with the velocity in

accordance with Wigner threshold behavior. As a consequence, the product of the relative

velocity and the quenching cross section attains a ﬁnite value in the limit of zero incident

kinetic energy, as illustrated in Fig. 5(b). The limiting value of the quenching rate coeﬃcient
is 2.4 × 10−13 cm3/s.

In ultracold collisions where s-wave scattering dominates, elastic and inelastic scattering

cross sections are conveniently expressed in terms of scattering lengths. The scattering length

is real when only elastic scattering is present, but it becomes complex with the inclusion of

inelastic channels9. The complex scattering length is given by aj1j2 = αj1j2 − iβj1j2 where

α and β are real and imaginary parts of the scattering length. The imaginary part of the

scattering length β is related to the zero-temperature limit of the quenching rate coeﬃcient:
kj1j2(T → 0) = 4πβj1j2~/µ. For the DJ potential we obtain the values α00 = 5.88 ˚A,
α20 = 5.78 ˚A, β20 = 0.003 ˚A, α22 = 5.83 ˚A, and β22 = 0.0023 ˚A. The corresponding values
for scattering on the BMKP potential are α00 = 6.16 ˚A, α20 = 6.16 ˚A, β20 = 0.00028 ˚A,
α22 = 6.16 ˚A, and β22 = 0.00071 ˚A. It is seen that the real part of the scattering length

remains practically unchanged for the three initial states indicating that no zero-energy

resonances occur for any of the three initial states on either PES. The presence of zero-energy

resonances (bound/quasibound states near channel thresholds) generally enhances the elastic

scattering cross section at low energies. The smaller value of the inelastic quenching rates

on the BMKP surface is also reﬂected in the values of β for all three initial states.

In Fig. 6 we compare cross sections for 22 → 00 and 22 → 20 transitions obtained

using the DJ potential with the CC calculations of Forrey12 based on the PES of Zarur and

Rabitz16. The agreement is remarkably good considering that the DJ potential is derived

from accurate ab initio calculations while that of Zarur and Rabitz is a model semi-empirical
potential. The reproduction of the shape resonance near E = 10−4 eV by the two potentials

is a good indicator of the accuracy of the two potential surfaces. The solid curve in Fig. 6

is the quenching cross section for 20 → 00 transition on the DJ potential and it is seen that

the cross sections for 22 → 20 transition is larger at all energies.

Further comparison between BMKP and the DJ potential is presented in Fig. 7 in which

we provide energy dependence of the excitation cross sections for 00 → 20, 22, 40, 42 and

44 transitions. The general trend in all cases, except for 00 → 40 at low energies, is that

the BMKP potential yields smaller values of cross sections compared to the DJ potential.

The diﬀerences get somewhat smeared out when the cross sections are integrated over a

Boltzmann distribution of relative velocities of the two molecules to yield the rate constants.

This is illustrated in Fig. 8 for the same transitions as given in Fig. 7. Comparison is also

made to the rate coeﬃcients computed by Flower21 which show better agreement with the

DJ results.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have performed quantum close-coupling calculations of elastic and inelastic rotational

transitions in collisions of H2 with H2 using the two most recently published ab initio interac-

tion potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the H4 system. The calculations span a wide range

of energies (9-orders of magnitude) extending from the zero-temperature limit to about 2.0

eV. Sensitivity of the results to details of the interaction potential is presented by computing

real and imaginary parts of the scattering lengths for diﬀerent initial rotational levels of the

two colliding H2 molecules. It is shown that the limiting elastic cross section is not very

sensitive to the initial rotational levels of the two H2 molecules although the inelastic cross

sections strongly depend on the initial rotational level.

We also showed that results obtained using the rigid rotor potential surface of Diep and

Johnson32 are in close agreement with the experimental measurements of Mat´e et al.31 for

00 → 20 rotational excitation rate coeﬃcient. However, the corresponding results obtained

using the Boothroyd et al.35 PES are a factor of ten smaller. This is quite signiﬁcant

because the Boothroyd et al. surface is generally believed to be the most accurate potential

surface for the H4 system and it has been used in two most recent six-dimensional quantum
mechanical calculations33,34 of rotational excitation in H2+H2 collisions. The present study

demonstrates that the BMKP surface will need to be reevaluated before it can be adopted

in large-scale scattering calculations, especially for astrophysical applications.

FIG. 1: Rate coeﬃcients for 00 → 20 rotational excitation in H2+H2 collisions as a function of

temperature. The solid and dashed curves are results obtained using the DJ and BMKP potentials,

respectively. The solid squares are the experimental results and the dotted line with crosses is the

theoretical calculation based on DJ PES by Mat´e et al.31. The results on the DJ potential agree

very well with the experiment data whereas those obtained with BMKP do not.

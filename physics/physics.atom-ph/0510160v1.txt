Comparison of classical and second quantized description of the dynamic Stark shift

We compare the derivation of the dynamic Stark shift of hydrogenic energy levels in a classical
framework with an adiabatically damped laser-atom interaction, which is equivalent to the Gell-
Mann-Low-Sucher formula, and a treatment based on time-independent perturbation theory, with
a second-quantized laser-atom dipole interaction Hamiltonian. Our analysis applies to a laser that
excites a two-photon transition in atomic hydrogen or in a hydrogenlike ion with low nuclear charge
number. Our comparisons serve to demonstrate why the dynamic Stark shift may be interpreted
as a stimulated radiative correction and illustrates connections between the two derivations. The
simplest of the derivations is the fully quantized approach. The classical and the second-quantized
treatment are shown to be equivalent in the limit of large photon numbers.

INTRODUCTION

The dynamic (AC) Stark shift is a perturbative eﬀect
that shifts atomic energy levels in a laser ﬁeld.
It is
an essential topic in precision spectroscopy experiments,
which have reached unprecedented accuracy1 and gen-
eral interest.2,3 The dynamic Stark eﬀect is well within
the reach of students who have studied the quantum me-
chanics of the hydrogen atom and can be understood at
diﬀerent levels in theoretical physics courses.

The two approaches we will present, the classical ﬁeld
and fully quantized ﬁeld description, coincide in the clas-
sical limit of high photon density, as is to be expected.
So the AC Stark eﬀect also serves as an example of how
to connect and contrast classical and quantum notions of
physical phenomena.

If an atom is exposed to external electromagnetic
ﬁelds, its energy levels are shifted due to the interaction
of the electrons with the ﬁeld. This shift of energy lev-
els can be observed in spectroscopic experiments, where
for example, absorption or ﬂuorescence spectra are mea-
sured. The Zeeman eﬀect describes this energy shift for
static magnetic ﬁelds, and the DC Stark eﬀect is respon-
sible for the level shift in static electric ﬁelds. Both these
eﬀects can be avoided in principle by a proper shielding
of the atom. However, the probing laser light with which
atoms are irradiated in order to obtain a spectrum also
constitutes a time-dependent electromagnetic ﬁeld and
Its
is necessarily always present in laser spectroscopy.
impact on atomic energy levels is called the AC Stark
eﬀect and for nondegenerate states it can be understood
as a time averaged DC Stark shift, as explained in the
Appendix. This statement holds only for oﬀ-resonant
driving of the atom, where the AC Stark shift can be
considered as a perturbation.

In this article oﬀ-resonant driving is to be understood
with regard to any electric-dipole allowed, one-photon
transition. Even in the nonresonant case two-photon
transitions can be driven eﬀectively when the frequency
of the incident radiation is close to half the atomic tran-
sition frequency.

Before we discuss the oﬀ-resonant excitation of an
atom by laser radiation, we brieﬂy mention the main dif-
ferences with the resonant case.4 Most importantly, if
the frequency of the incident radiation is close to a one-
photon resonance, then the inﬂuence of the laser ﬁeld
on the atomic levels lies outside the regime of perturba-
tion theory and must be included nonperturbatively in
the dressed-state picture. The reason is that the dipole
matrix element between the states involved is nonzero
for one-photon transitions. Consequently, the level shift
is linear in the electric ﬁeld amplitude of the laser, in
contrast to the quadratic dependence that we will obtain
for oﬀ-resonant excitation. For further information on
dressed states we refer the reader to Refs. 8,9,10,11.

In a classical framework the dynamic Stark shift can
be described by time-dependent perturbation theory. We
will demonstrate that the dynamic Stark shift can be
used to illustrate some basic aspects of quantum electro-
dynamics (QED). The dominant shift of the energy levels
in this case can be attributed to a second-order pertur-
bation in which a laser-photon is created or annihilated
in a virtual intermediate state.

This article is also devoted to showing that the AC
Stark shift can be identiﬁed as a stimulated radiative
correction.12 Indeed, the AC Stark shift is approximately
equivalent to a spectral component of the electron self-
energy (Lamb shift) that results when we restrict the dis-
cussion to a single mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, but
with an important diﬀerence: for the Lamb shift the pho-
ton modes are all unoccupied in the unperturbed state
in contrast to the AC Stark shift for which there is one
highly occupied mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, the
laser mode.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II the dy-
namic Stark shift is described using a classical laser ﬁeld,
which necessitates the use of time-dependent perturba-
tion theory and an adiabatically damped interaction. In
contrast in Sec. III we derive the dynamic Stark shift
using a quantized-ﬁeld approach and time-independent
perturbation theory. The classical and second-quantized
results are shown to agree in the classical limit, that is,
for a macroscopically populated laser ﬁeld mode.

II. CLASSICAL FIELD APPROACH

From the Dyson series we can calculate the time evolution
operator UI(ǫ, t) up to second order in VI:

2

In this section we rederive the classical expressions for
the dynamic (AC) Stark shift using a classical description
of the laser ﬁeld. Our approach is the usual one employed
in the literature, and our treatment and our notation
is inspired by Chap. 5 of Ref. 13. Let us consider the
Hamiltonian

H = H0 + V (ǫ, t),

(1)

where

H0 =

p2
2me

−

Ze2
4πǫ0r

,

V (ǫ, t) = V exp(−ǫ|t|) cos(ωLt),

V = −ezEL.

(2a)

(2b)
(2c)

The Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) describes a hydrogen atom
(Z = 1) or a hydrogen-like ion of nuclear charge number
Z > 1 in a plane-wave monochromatic laser ﬁeld, polar-
ized along the z-direction, adiabatically damped in the
distant past (t → −∞) and the distant future (t → ∞).
H0 describes the nonrelativistic unperturbed hydrogen
Hamiltonian, and V (ǫ, t) is the time-dependent, adiabat-
ically damped, harmonic perturbation with magnitude
V ; ǫ is the inﬁnitesimal damping parameter (see, for ex-
ample, p. 342 of Ref. 13). We have assumed that the
wavelength of the driving light of angular frequency ωL
is large compared to the spatial extent of the atomic
wave functions (the dipole approximation). The laser-
atom interaction V (ǫ, t) is treated in the length gauge
as in Ref. 14 with electric ﬁeld amplitude EL. The elec-
tric ﬁeld strength involved in V (ǫ, t) is a gauge-invariant
quantity.14

The parameter ǫ > 0 is introduced to avoid a sudden
turn-on of the perturbation. In the limit ǫ → 0 we will
obtain the constant intensity result after carrying out the
relevant time integrations of the ﬁrst few terms in the
Dyson series. The introduction of an adiabatic damping
parameter is also a key element of time-dependent pertur-
bation theory in QED.15 In QED the interaction Hamil-
tonian is usually expressed in the interaction picture and
a time-dependence is incurred for the ﬁeld operators (see
Appendix A of Ref. 6).

Energy shifts in QED are usually formulated using the
Gell-Mann-Low-Sucher theorem.16,17 The applicability of
this theorem is not restricted to the case of perturba-
tions in a second-quantized approach, but can be applied
equally well to a time-dependent, classical perturbation.
We now consider the eﬀect of the oﬀ-resonant pertur-
bation by an time-dependent electric ﬁeld on a reference
state |φi of the unperturbed atom. In the interaction pic-
ture (denoted by the subscript I), V (ǫ, t) is represented
by

Now consider the time-dependent atomic state |ψI(t)i in
the interaction picture subject to the initial condition
|ψI(t = −∞)i = |φi, where the reference state |φi is an
eigenstate of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0. We ex-
pand |ψI(t)i in a complete set {|mi} of eigenstates of H0
as

|ψI(t)i = UI(ǫ, t)|ψI(−∞)i =

cm(t)|mi,

(5)

where cm(t) = hm|ψI (t)i. The initial condition is thus
cφ(−∞) = 1 for the reference state |φi with all other
cm(−∞) equal to zero. We are interested in the projec-
tion

cφ(t) = hφ|ψI(t)i = hφ|UI(ǫ, t)|φi.

(6)

We substitute UI(ǫ, t) from Eq. (4) and because hφ|z|φi
vanishes for parity eigenstates |φi, the leading order is
V 2 and the problem reduces to calculating the matrix
element

where the multi-index m counts all bound and contin-
uum states of the unperturbed hydrogen atom. Because
the perturbation is harmonic, the time integrals can be
done without diﬃculty, convergence being ensured by the
adiabatic damping. We obtain

notes the summation of the two terms diﬀering only in

factor of 1/4 originate from the deﬁnition of the cosine in

The nonreference states from Eq. (13) give no contribu-

ence state |φi by projecting the time-evolved perturbed
state onto the reference state such that the perturbation
to the eigenenergy Eφ can be directly seen.

Note that ∆EAC(φ) can in general be complex, rather

than real. We deﬁne

This derivation completes our analysis of the AC Stark
shift using an adiabatically damped,13 classical-ﬁeld14
approach.

To illustrate the connection to the Gell-Mann-Low-
Sucher theorem, we observe that cφ(0) in Eqs. (6) and
(9) can be identiﬁed with the quantity hα|U (0, −∞; ǫ)|αi
in the notation of Ref. 17, and the perturbation V (ǫ, t)
as deﬁned in Eq. (2b) has to be supplemented by an aux-
iliary scaling variable g,

V (ǫ, t) → gV (ǫ, t).

(20)

The parameter g is later set equal to unity. We then have
according to Eq. (2±) of Ref. 17,

The latter result ∆E = ∆EAC(φ) agrees with Eq. (12).
In the step leading to Eq. (21c), an expansion of the log-
arithm in powers of g is implied, which is equivalent to a
second-order expansion in the time-dependent perturba-
tion V .

(15)

(16)

The real part of the AC Stark eﬀect describes the energy
shift of the unperturbed energy Eφ, and the imaginary
part, if present, can be interpreted as the ionization rate
γφ. We can now express the dynamic Stark shift of |φi
as

sum of two matrix elements, where E is the energy of
the respective intermediate state E = Eφ ∓ ~ωL:

III. FULLY QUANTIZED APPROACH

In the classical picture we set the ﬁeld amplitude to
a constant value EL and used time-dependent perturba-
tion theory with an adiabatic damping parameter. When
treating the light as a photon ﬁeld, the classical picture
can be interpreted as the limit of the fully quantized
treatment in the limit of a large photon number.

In second quantization the Hamiltonian for the coupled

system, atom + radiation ﬁeld, reads

H =

En|nihn| + ~ωLa†

LaL + HL.

(22)

ZXn

The ﬁrst term contains a sum over the discrete spec-
trum and an integral over the continuous spectrum of
the Schr¨odinger equation. We do not consider electron-
positron pair creation, and therefore we do not quantize

gives the energy density in which the atom is immersed,
which is related to the intensity via

I = wc.

(27)

We use Eqs. (25)–(27) and obtain

∆EAC(φ) = −

IPωL (φ),

(28)

e2
2ǫ0c

in agreement with Eq. (18). Thus the classical-ﬁeld and
the quantized-ﬁeld approach give consistent results in the
classical limit.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have contrasted two ways of deriving analytic ex-
pressions for the dynamic Stark shift of a hydrogenic en-
ergy level. The ﬁrst, based on an adiabatically damped
length-gauge interaction (see Eq. (2b)), leads to a clas-
sical treatment where the electric laser ﬁeld is simply
modeled as a periodic perturbation (see Sec. II). The
second derivation, based on a quantized description of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld, leads to expressions that are
equivalent to the classical expressions in the limit of a
large occupation number of the laser mode (see Sec. III).
The AC Stark shift has been characterized as a stim-
ulated radiative correction12 because it results from a
self-energy-like formalism if the sum over virtual modes
of the photon ﬁeld is restricted to a single mode: the
laser mode. We illustrated this statement by giving an
explicit derivation in Eq. (24). This treatment is based
on time-independent ﬁeld operators. Equation (24) illus-
trates how the classical predictions should be modiﬁed in
an environment where the photon number is not large.
Indeed, the AC Stark shift receives an interpretation in
this context as the second-order perturbation incurred
by the coupled system, atom + laser ﬁeld, due to vir-
tual creation and annihilation of laser photons. When
the perturbation is evaluated using an empty Fock space
as the unperturbed state, and when a sum is formed
over all possible virtual excitations, the self-energy is
obtained.6,21.

(See also Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8) of Ref. 6.) The symbol V
denotes the normalization volume and is chosen so that
the energy density of a one-photon Fock state when in-
tegrated over V yields ~ωL.
It might be argued that
a coherent state of the photon ﬁeld is a much better
description than a Fock state with nL photons in the
laser mode, which we have assumed here. However, in
the limit of large photon number, the relative ﬂuctuation
of the photon number δnL/nL goes to zero for a coher-
ent state, and we may therefore resort to the Fock-state
approximation.19

We work in the Schr¨odinger picture where the ﬁeld
operators carry no time dependence. It is not so widely
known that it is possible to formulate time-independent
operators for the quantized radiation ﬁeld, let alone to do
meaningful calculations with these operators. However,
this formulation is introduced in a few textbooks such as
Ref. 18.

The concept of time-independent ﬁeld operators has
also been used for quantum electrodynamic calculations
(see for example, Eq. (5) of Ref. 20). Following this
approach, we are now in a position to apply time-
independent perturbation theory.6 This approach leads
to the following second-order result for the energy shift
of the unperturbed eigenstate |φ, nLi,

The sum over virtual intermediate states |mi has been
split into two parts depending on the number of photons
in the ﬁeld.
In the classical limit nL → ∞, V → ∞,
nL/V = constant, we can simplify Eq. (24) to read

∆EAC(φ) = −

APPENDIX A: DC STARK SHIFT

We use the relation

For nondegenerate states, the DC Stark shift is a
second-order perturbation in the electric ﬁeld strength
and can be interpreted as the zero-frequency limit of the
AC Stark shift.
In this appendix we brieﬂy illustrate
this relation. In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics the
ground state is the only nondegenerate state. However,
as a consequence of the spin of the electron (ﬁne struc-
ture), the spin of the nucleus (hyperﬁne structure) and
QED eﬀects (Lamb shift), the degeneracy of other states
is broken, and as long as the DC Stark shift is small
compared to these energy diﬀerences, the following con-
siderations also hold for excited states. For larger per-
turbations, the DC Stark eﬀect is linear in the electric
ﬁeld.

For a state |φi that fulﬁlls the above conditions, con-
sider the limit of the dynamic Stark shift obtained in
Eq. (18) as the angular frequency of the laser ﬁeld goes

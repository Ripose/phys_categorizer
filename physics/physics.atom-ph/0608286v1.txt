infrared-active modes

Enhanced positron annihilation on polyatomic molecules is a long-standing and complex problem.
We report the results of calculations of resonant positron annihilation on methyl halides. A free
parameter of our theory is the positron binding energy. A comparison with energy-resolved anni-
hilation rates measured for CH3F, CH3Cl, CH3Br [Barnes et al. Phys. Rev. A 74, 012706 (2006)]
shows good agreement and yields estimates of the binding energies.

In this paper we calculate the positron-molecule an-
nihilation rate due to resonant capture of positrons
by infrared-active vibrational modes, and observe good
agreement with recent experimental data for methyl
halides [1].

When a fast positron interacts with matter, it under-
goes a quick succession of ionizing and other inelastic col-
lisions, and slows down to eV or thermal energies before
annihilation. The low-energy positron annihilation rate
in a gas with number density n is usually parametrized
as

σavn = πr2

0cnZeﬀ ,

λ

≡

(1)

where σa is the annihilation cross section, v is the
positron velocity, c is the speed of light, r0 is the clas-
sical electron radius, and Zeﬀ is an eﬀective number of
electrons per gas atom or molecule, that contribute to
annihilation [2, 3]. Originally, Zeﬀ was introduced in ex-
pectation that the annihilation rate would be in propor-
tion to the number of target electrons, Z. However, early
experiments [4, 5, 6] and later systematic studies [7, 8, 9]
found that for many polyatomic molecules Zeﬀ exceeded
Z by orders of magnitude. It also showed strong chemi-
cal sensitivity and rapid growth with molecular size (see
review [10]).

Explanations of high molecular Zeﬀ were sought
in terms of positron virtual or weakly bound states
[11], resonances [12, 13], long-lived vibrationally excited
positron-molecule complexes [8], and virtual Ps forma-
tion [14]. At the same time, annihilation calculations
which neglected molecular vibrations, failed to reproduce
“anomalous” Zeﬀ for polyatomics [15, 16], but gave evi-
dence that Zeﬀ depend on the molecular geometry [17].
These eﬀorts highlight the fact that positron-molecule
annihilation is a complex problem. Nevertheless, a the-
ory developed in Refs.
[18, 19, 20] provides a frame-
work for analyzing this phenomenon. There are two ba-
sic mechanisms of positron annihilation, direct and res-
onant. The direct mechanism applies to both atoms
and molecules and involves annihilation of an incident
positron “in ﬂight”. Its contribution is enhanced when

a low-lying virtual or weakly bound positron state is
present, leading to Zeﬀ up to 103 for room-temperature
positrons [18, 19].

Resonant annihilation occurs for molecules capable of
binding the positron. To be captured into a bound state,
the positron energy must be absorbed by a vibrational
excitation of the positron-molecule complex. This gives
rise to a vibrational Feshbach resonance (VFR) at the
incident positron energy ε = Eν + ε0, where Eν is the
vibrational excitation energy, and ε0 < 0 is the positron
bound state energy. The positron bound in the VFR can
annihilate (or undergo detachment). The probability of
annihilation is proportional to the resonance lifetime.

For non-monoenergetic positrons and closely spaced
resonances, their contribution to Zeﬀ is proportional to
the vibrational level density at E
ε0 [18, 19]. If
the positron VFR were due to excitation of fundamentals
alone, this density would be proportional to the number
of modes. Experimental Zeﬀ show much faster increase
(e.g., Zeﬀ = 3500, 11 300, and 37 800 for C3H8, C4H10,
and C5H12, respectively). This means that positron at-
tachment involves excitation of overtones and combina-
tion vibrations. Large Zeﬀ are then related to high total
vibrational spectrum densities in the polyatomics.

The important role of vibrations was recently veriﬁed
by measuring the energy dependence of Zeﬀ at sub-eV
energies with a high-resolution positron beam [21, 22].
These experiments uncovered peaks in Zeﬀ, whose en-
ergies corresponded to those of molecular vibrational
modes. In particular, for all alkanes larger than methane,
Zeﬀ displayed a prominent C–H maximum.
Its down-
shift from the C–H mode energy (0.37 eV) provided a
measure of the positron binding energy [23]. Observa-
tion of such peaks means that excited fundamentals act
as vibrational doorway states [20], leading to multimode
vibrations through intramolecular vibrational relaxation
(IVR).

Therefore, to compute Zeﬀ for polyatomics, one must
account for strong electron-positron correlations and
positron binding, the interaction between positronic and
vibrational degrees of freedom and intramolecular vibra-

tional mixing. This makes ab initio calculations of high
molecular Zeﬀ very diﬃcult. However, as we show below,
for small polyatomics some basic features of resonant an-
nihilation can be tested by relatively simple calculations.
The resonant part of the annihilation cross section can
be written using the Breit-Wigner formalism [19, 20, 24],

Consider a compact polyatomic molecule that can bind
the positron with a small binding energy
1
eV. The wavefunction of the bound positron is very dif-
fuse and behaves as ϕ0 = Ar−1e−κr outside the molecule.
Since large distances dominate, the normalization con-
(κ/2π)1/2 [25].

Suppose that the vibrational modes in this small-sized
polyatomic are not mixed with overtones or combination
vibrations. Given the smallness of the binding energy, the
vibrational excitation energies of the positron-molecule
complex should be close to the fundamental frequencies
ων of the neutral molecule. In this case the sum in Eq.

capture into such excited states is mediated by the long-
range dipole coupling. This allows one to calculate their
contribution to Z (res)
eﬀ .

In a recent paper [1] measurements of Zeﬀ for CH3Cl
and CH3Br using a cold trap-based positron beam, have
been reported. The energy dependence of Zeﬀ for these
molecules (and CH3F measured earlier [22]) shows peaks
close to the vibrational mode energies. This points to
an important contribution of resonant annihilation in all
three molecules, although the maximum Zeﬀ value for
CH3F (250) is much lower than those for CH3Cl and
CH3Br (1600 and 2000, respectively).

These molecules have C3v symmetry, and all six of
their vibrational modes are infrared active (see Table I for
CH3Cl). Methyl halides are also relatively small, which
means that IVR may not take place [31]. This makes
them ideal for application of our theory. Equations (4),
(7), and (8) allow one to calculate the contribution of all
VFR to Z (res)
eﬀ , and the only free parameter of the the-
ory, i.e., the positron binding energy, can be chosen by
comparison with experimental Zeﬀ.

In order to do this, Z (res)

from Eq. (4) must be aver-
aged over the energy distribution of the positron beam
[22]. The latter can be modelled by a combination of the
Gaussian distribution in the longitudinal direction (z)
and Maxwellian distribution in the transversal direction
). The corresponding probability density of the total

can be done analytically, since the widths of the reso-
nances, Γν = Γe
ν, are small compared to the en-
ergy spread of the positron beam. Indeed, values from
the last column of Table I show that the elastic widths
of the VFR are less then 0.1 meV. Typical annihilation
widths are even smaller. For example, for a binding en-
ergy of 10 meV (κ = 0.027 a.u.), Eqs. (3) and (8) yield
10−9 a.u. = 0.1 µeV. These estimates also show

The function ∆(E) is a convolution of the δ-function
with the positron energy distribution.
It describes the
appearance of a narrow resonance when measured with
the trap-based positron beam, and is shown in Fig. 1.
Due to the transversal energy component, its maximum is
downshifted by 12 meV from the true resonance position.
The shape of ∆(E) is also markedly asymmetric, with
an extended low energy tail. It agrees well with those of
the observed C–H peaks [21, 22]. Note that the positron
energy distribution was taken into account in experiment
by assuming a 16 meV diﬀerence between the positron
total and longitudinal energies [22].

In accord with Eq.

Given the complexity of the problem and the fact that
ε0 is the only free parameter in the calculation, the agree-
ment between theory and experiment in Fig. 2 is re-
markable.
(9), every vibrational
mode gives rise to a VFR, whose relative magnitude is
determined by the factor gν/kν (since Γe
1). On
the positron longitudinal energy scale, the resonances are
downshifted from the mode energies by the positron bind-
ing energy and a further 12 meV due to the positron
energy distribution.

Besides determining the resonance positions, the bind-
ing energy also aﬀects the overall magnitude of Z (res)
via
1/2 [Eq. (8)]. Hence, the smallness of Zeﬀ in
ρep ∝ |
CH3F in comparison with those of CH3Cl and CH3Br is
related to the weakness of its binding. This is in turn
related to the smaller dipole polarizability and higher
ionization potential of ﬂuoromethane, which make it less
attractive for the positron.

Γe

ν ∼

Note that the infrared absorption strengths of the
ωνd2
modes and the corresponding elastic widths, Γe
ν,
may vary considerably from mode to mode. On the other
hand, the contribution of diﬀerent modes to Zeﬀ are simi-
lar, apart from energy shift and gν/kν factor. As a result,
the energy dependence of Zeﬀ has little resemblance to
the molecular infrared absorption spectra [1]. The rela-
ν also means that the contributions of the
tion Γν ≈
VFR are not sensitive to the exact values of the elastic
widths. Therefore, our use of the “Born-dipole” approx-
imation in the derivation of Eq. (7) is not expected to
lead to sizeable errors in Z (res)
eﬀ .
In conclusion, we have presented a theory of positron
annihilation by capture into vibrational resonances of
infrared-active modes. It agrees well with measured Zeﬀ
for methyl halides and yields estimates of the positron
binding energies for these molecules.

This theory can also be used to investigate the con-
tribution of infrared-active-mode VFRs to Zeﬀ in other
small polyatomics that can bind positrons. Such calcula-
tions will likely underestimate the Zeﬀ , because the res-
onances associated with other (non-dipole) modes may
contribute just as much, as long as their elastic widths
are greater than the annihilation width.

In molecules where multiquantum vibrations are cou-
pled by anharmonicity, the number of VFRs populated
by positron capture will be greatly increased, leading to
much higher Zeﬀ . However, the same coupling will also
allow the VFR to decay by positron emission to vibra-
tionally excited states of the molecule. This will increase
the total resonance widths, thereby reducing their indi-
vidual contributions. Calculation of Zeﬀ for molecules
with IVR is the next big challenge for the theory.

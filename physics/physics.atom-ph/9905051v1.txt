An improved hyperspherical harmonic method for the quantum three-
body problem is presented to separate three rotational degrees of freedom
completely from the internal ones. In this method, the Schr¨odinger equation
of three-body problem is reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations
in terms of the orthogonal bases of functions. As an important example in
quantum mechanics, the energies and the eigenfunctions of some states of
the helium atom and the helium-like ions are calculated.

I. INTRODUCTION

Exact solutions played very important roles in the development of physics. The exact
solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation for a hydrogen atom and for a harmonic oscillator
laid a foundation of quantum mechanics. The next simplest atom is the helium atom,
which is a typical three-body problem and has not been well-solved both in classical
mechanics [1] and in quantum mechanics [2]. The Faddeev equations [3] are popularly
used in both scattering processes [4] and bound state calculations [5] for the quantum
three-body problem. However, only a few analytically solvable examples were found [6].
For the helium atom, variational methods can achieve 9- to 12-place precision for energy
values with a few hundred or thousand variational parameters [7-10]. There are many
reasons to prefer the direct solutions of the three-body Schr¨odinger equation over the
variational one, for example, the analytic structure of the variational wavefunction is
chosen arbitrarily. The accurate direct solution of the three-body Schr¨odinger equation
with the separated center-of-mass motion has been sought based on diﬀerent numerical
methods, such as the ﬁnite diﬀerence [11], ﬁnite element [12], complex coordinate rotation
[13], hyperspherical coordinate [14], and hyperspherical harmonic [15-17] methods.

In the hyperspherical harmonic method [15-17], the six Jacobi coordinates, after sep-
aration of the center-of-mass motion, are separated to one hyperradial variable ρ and ﬁve
hyperangular variables Ω. The wave function is presented as a sum of products of hyper-
radial function and the hyperspherical harmonic function, depending on Ω. Since three
degrees of freedom for the rotation of the system are not separated completely from the
internal ones, there is the huge degeneracy of the hyperspherical basis. The interactions
in the three-body problem is not hyperspherically symmetric so that the matrix elements

of the potential have to be calculated between diﬀerent hyperspherical harmonic states.
Another diﬃculty in the practical calculations by the hyperspherical harmonic method
is the slow convergence of the series. The convergence was fastened by decomposing the
wavefunction ψ = χφ, where χ is chosen to take into account the singularities of the po-
tential and the clustering properties of the wavefunction, and φ is the part to be expanded
in hypersphericals [15].

In an unpublished paper [18], Hsiang and Hsiang devised a principle method to reduce
the Schr¨odinger equation of three-body problem to a system of linear algebraic equations.
Although their method was incomplete, it contained a good idea for simplifying the quan-
tum three-body problem. Developing their idea, we suggest an improved hyperspherical
harmonic method to separate three rotational degrees of freedom completely from the
internal ones, and the decomposition of the function for fastening the convergence of the
series in the hyperspherical harmonic method [15-17] is still eﬀective in the improved
method.

First, after the separation of the center-of-mass motion and the whole rotation, the
three-body Schr¨odinger equation with any given angular momentum and parity is reduced
to the coupled partial diﬀerential equations, depending upon only three variables, which
are invariant in the rotation of the system. The coupled equations are closed because
the potential depends only upon those three variables due to its symmetry in the SO(3)
rotation and the space inversion. Then, we expand the solutions of the coupled equations
by the orthogonal bases of functions to reduce the coupled partial diﬀerential equations to
the coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations. The bases of functions are similar to those in
the S wave case of the hyperspherical harmonic method [16], but in our method they are
eﬀective for any given angular momentum. The coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations
are similar to the hyperradial equations for the hyperradius in the hyperspherical har-
monic method [16], but there is an important diﬀerence between them. The diﬀerential
operators in each ordinary diﬀerential equation of our coupled equations are same so that
the equations can be reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations by the spectral de-
composition of the hyperradial function. This improved hyperspherical harmonic method
is eﬀective for the three-body problems of both identical and non-identical particles, and
eﬀective for any pair potential, which depends only upon the distance of each pair of
particles.

The improved hyperspherical harmonic method greatly decreases the calculating time,
because to solve a system of linear algebraic equations even with the equation number
more than 1000 is faster than to solve a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations with the
equation number less than ten. Furthermore, all the technique used in the hyperspherical
harmonic method to fasten the convergence of the series can also be used in the improved
hyperspherical harmonic method.

In this paper we will demonstrate the improved hyperspherical harmonic method in
some detail. In Sec. II we introduce our notations and write the Schr¨odinger equation
for a three-body problem in the center-of-mass frame by the Jacobi coordinates. Due
to the SO(3) symmetry of the Schr¨odinger equation, in Sec.
III we will explain how
to separate the rotational degrees of freedom completely from the internal ones, and
derive the formulas for reducing the three-body Schr¨odinger equation with any given
angular momentum and parity to a system of partial diﬀerential equations. In Sec. IV
we introduce three new variables through the complex vector coordinates [19]. By a

2

complete set of normalized and orthogonal bases of functions of those new variables, the
Schr¨odinger equation for any angular momentum and parity is further reduced to a system
of linear algebraic equations with some coeﬃcients to be calculated. In terms of some
identities, proved in Appendix, the alternating series contained in the formulas for the
coeﬃcients are calculated analytically. As an important example in quantum mechanics,
the problem of a helium atom is studied in some detail. We solve the system of linear
algebraic equations for the lowest-energy states of the S wave and the P wave in both the
parahelium and the orthohelium in Sec. V, respectively. We also calculate the energies of
the ground state of some helium-like ions there. The solution of the Schr¨odinger equation
for the three-body problem is called exact in the meaning that it is expressed as an inﬁnite
series in terms of the orthogonal bases of functions, and can be calculated in any precision
if enough terms in the series are included. Due to our limited condition in computer, in
the present paper we still use the truncation method of the series and do not fasten the
convergence of the series by decomposition of the wavefunction, so that the calculating
precision is in the thousandths for the energy of the ground state of the helium atom
and in the hundredths for the remaining calculating results. The calculating precision
will be improved elsewhere. The main purpose of this paper is to present the improved
hyperspherical harmonic method. Some discussions are given in Sec. VI.

II. THE SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION

Denote by rj and by Mj, j = 1, 2, 3, the position vectors and the masses of three
particles in a three-body problem, respectively. The relative masses are mj = Mj/M,
where M is the total mass, M =
Mj. The Schr¨odinger equation for the three-body
problem is

Now, we replace the position vectors rj by the Jacobi coordinates Rj:

III. EIGENFUNCTIONS OF THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM

The Schr¨odinger equation (1) is spherically symmetric so that its solution can be
factorized into a product of an eigenfunction of the angular momentum L and a ”radial”
function, which only depends upon three variables, invariant in the rotation of the system:

ξ1 = x

ξ2 = y

ξ3 = x

We call them the ”radial” variables in this paper.

For a particle moving in a central ﬁeld, the eigenfunction of the angular momentum
m(θ, ϕ). What is the generalization of the spherical

is the spherical harmonic function Y ℓ
harmonic function to the three-body problem?

A natural idea for generalization is to introduce the angular variables, for example, the
Euler angles. In this way, as discussed by Wigner (see p.214 in [20]), the eigenfunction of
the angular momentum is the representation matrix of the SO(3) group, Dℓ
mm′(α, β, γ).
However, the Schr¨odinger equation with respect to the Euler angles is singular. In the
hyperspherical harmonic method [16] the spherical harmonic function is generalized to
the hyperspherical harmonic function, which depends upon ﬁve angular variables Ω =
(α, θx, ϕx, θy, ϕy), where θx (θy) and ϕx (ϕy) are the angular variables of x (y). Obviously,
the rotational degrees of freedom are not separated from the internal ones. Is it necessary
to introduce the angular variables explicitly?

In order to avoid the angular variables, let us study the other properties of the spherical
harmonic function, in addition to the eigenfunction of the angular momentum. As is well
m(θ, ϕ), where (r, θ, ϕ) are the spherical coordinates for the position
known,
vector x, is a homogeneous polynomial of degree ℓ with respect to the components of x,
and satisﬁes the Laplace equation as well as the eigen-equation for the angular momentum,
but does not contain the angular variables and the r2 factor explicitly. The number of
linearly independent homogeneous polynomials of degree ℓ with respect to the components
of x is N(ℓ):

N(ℓ) =

It is nothing but the number of

According to the theory of angular momentum [20], the polynomials

It coincides with the number given in Eq. (12). In other words, the eigenfunctions of the
angular momentum L2 with the eigenvalue ℓ(ℓ+1), not containing the factors ξj, are those
homogeneous polynomials of degree ℓ or degree (ℓ + 1). Let us introduce a parameter
λ = 0 or 1 to identify them. Due to the property of the spherical symmetry, what we
need is to write the eigenfunctions of L2 with the largest eigenvalue of L3, where the
normalization factors do not matter with us. Denote them by Qℓλ

(29). The square of the factor ¯h2k/(√2Me2) is the energy
E in the unit Me4/¯h2. This
factor can be calculated by the condition that the coeﬃcient determinant of the coupled
linear algebraic equations vanishes. This problem of calculation can be changed to an
eigenvalue problem. In the real calculation, the inﬁnite series is truncated at integers Nj

V. THE HELIUM ATOM

The problem of a helium atom is a typical three-body problem with two identical
particles. For this problem, we enumerate the helium nucleus to be the ﬁrst particle,
and two identical electrons to be the second and the third particles. Denote by MHe and
e,
Me the masses of the nucleus and the electron, whose electric charges are 2e and
respectively. Thus,

Therefore, the coeﬃcient C(n) in Eq. (29) becomes real. Hereafter we only remain the

where M = MHe + 2Me is the total mass of the helium atom.

Although the spin-dependent interactions are neglected in the Schr¨odinger equation
(1) for the helium atom, the symmetric eﬀects of the spins of two electrons have to
be taken account. The helium is called parahelium if the spinor part of wavefunction
is antisymmetric (S = 0), and it is called orthohelium if the spinor wavefunction is
symmetric (S = 1). Therefore, the spatial wavefunction of parahelium is symmetric with
respect to the permutation of two electrons, and that of orthohelium is antisymmetric.

On the other hand, in our notation, in the permutation of two electrons, y changes
its sign and x remains invariant, namely, β changes its sign, ρ and α remain invariant, so
that L(m)
n (ρ) remain invariant, Znm(α, β) changes to its complex conjugate, and Qℓλ

The square of the factor ¯h2k/(√2meMe2) in Eq. (44) is the binding energy

E in the
unit e2/a0, where a0 = ¯h2/(Mee2) is the Bohr radius. This factor can be calculated from
the condition that the coeﬃcient determinant of Eq. (44) vanishes. The coeﬃcient matrix
on the left hand side of Eq. (44) is a direct product of a (N1 + 1)-dimensional matrix and
a unit matrix. Removing it to the right hand side by right-multiplying with its inverse
matrix, we reduce the problem of calculating energy into an eigenvalue problem. In the
numerical calculation, we take N1 = 7, N2 = 8 and N3 = 16, and obtain the energy for
the ground state of a helium atom:

both electrons from a helium atom is 2.90351e2/a0 ∼
79.00eV. The relative deviation of
the calculated energy from the observed value is in the thousandths.

We also obtain the eigenfunction for the ground state of helium, expressed as the series

There are two sets of solutions for the P wave with the diﬀerent parities. The eigen-

Q11

It is larger than the ionization energy (24.58eV) of the helium atom, which is the minimum
energy required to remove one electron from the ground state of a helium atom. In the shell
model, this P -wave state has to be composed of two P -wave electrons. According to the
Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients [20], the angular part of its wavefunction is antisymmetric [see
Eq. (50)]. Therefore, this state should be explained in the shell model as the compound
state of one 2P and one 3P electrons, because its radial function has to be antisymmetric.

VI. DISCUSSIONS

In this paper we have presented an improved hyperspherical harmonic method for
directly solving the quantum three-body problem. Applying this method to the problem
of the helium atom, we have calculated the lowest energies and the wavefunctions of some
states of the S wave and the P wave in the parahelium and in the orthohelium. The
relative error for the energy of the ground state of the parahelium is in the thousandths,
but the remaining results have the relative error of a few percents.

The main approximation, which we have made in our calculation, is to take the ﬁnite
Nj in the series for the wavefunctions. If the coeﬃcients of the truncated terms in the series
are much smaller than the needed precision, the calculated results will be satisfactory. For
example, for the ground state of the helium, when N1 = 7, N2 = 8 and N3 = 16, we ﬁnd
that all the coeﬃcients at the truncated terms are much less than 0.001:

f7,0,0 = 1.046

10−7,

f0,8,0 = 2.995

10−4,

f0,0,16 = 2.983

10−4.

Therefore, the relative error of the calculated energy must be in the thousandths. It also
can be seen in the calculated results of the energy when diﬀerent Nj are taken:

2.88805(e2/a0),
2.88935(e2/a0),

From the viewpoint of calculation, to raise N1 and N3 will only increases the calculating
quantity, but when N2 raises, the formula for calculating the coeﬃcients D(n, m, n′, m′)
becomes much complicated. Now, it is hard for us to raise N2 more than eight. It is the
reason that we have to accept the precision of a few percents for the remaining calculated
energies, and to leave the improvement of the precision in the future. For example, for the
lowest-energy state of the S wave in the orthohelium, when N1 = 7, N2 = 8 and N3 = 17,
the coeﬃcients at the truncated terms are

Due to the restriction in N2, the relative error of the calculated energy is in the hundredths.
However, the existence of a P wave state of even parity in the parahelium with the energy
0.58(e2/a0) is reliable. Note that this state is forbidden for the electric dipole
−
transition to the ground state, but it is allowed to the P wave state with odd parity.
The energy diﬀerence in the allowed transition is around 39.18eV. We are waiting for the
observation of this transition in experiments.

∼

It seems that the existence of this state conﬂicts with the shell model in the atomic
physics. In the shell model two electrons in the helium atom are supposed to ﬁll in the
energy levels of a hydrogen-like atom according to the exclusion principle. The lowest-
energy state of the P wave with the even parity has to be composed of two P wave
electrons. From the shell model, two 2P electrons cannot compose a P wave state with
symmetric spatial wavefunction, and this state has to be explained as the compound state
of one 2P and one 3P electrons. In this state each electron moves in the electric ﬁeld of
the nucleus, screened by the other electron:

If one electron moves completely inside of the other electron, Z1 = 2 and Z2 = 1, or
vice versa. In the real case, Z1 is less than 2 and Z2 is larger than 1. We assume that
Z1 = 2
E(τ ) is a function of
the parameter τ , and given in the unit e2/a0 as follows:

τ , Z2 = 1 + τ , and 0

This estimation is very rough, but it shows qualitatively that this P wave state seems not
to be the compound state of one 2P and one 3P electrons in the shell model. If it is true,
the shell model in the atomic physics is challenged even qualitatively. We sincerely hope
that this P wave state with the even parity in the parahelium will be studied further in
both theoretical and experimental physics.

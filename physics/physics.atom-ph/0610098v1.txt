We propose a combination of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT)/Raman and pulsed
spectroscopy techniques to accurately cancel frequency shifts arising from EIT ﬁelds in forbidden
optical lattice clock transitions of alkaline earth atoms. Time-separated laser pulses are designed
to trap atoms in coherent superpositions while eliminating oﬀ-resonance ac Stark contributions
at particular laser detunings from the intermediate excited state. The scheme achieves eﬃcient
population transfer up to 60% with potential inaccuracy < 10−17. Cancellation of external light
shifts determined by a density matrix approach is conﬁrmed by a complex wave-function formalism,
suﬃcient at the mHz accuracy, under low ﬁeld strengths or short interaction times.

In the ﬁeld of optical frequency standards and clocks,
single trapped ions [1] and alkaline earth atoms [2, 3, 4,
5, 6] are attractive systems for improved clock perfor-
mances. The optimism arises from superhigh resonance
quality factors of these optical transitions, which are ex-
pected to be 105 better than microwave fountains already
approaching the 10−16 relative fractional uncertainty and
a stability of ∼ 1.6 × 10−14 at 1 s [7], limited by the
quantum projection noise. Fermionic isotopes of alkaline
earths trapped in optical lattices at the magic wavelength
[8, 9] oﬀer ultra narrow linewidths of a few mHz without
recoil and Doppler eﬀects, but remain potentially sensi-
tive to systematic eﬀects arising from the nuclear spin-
related hyperpolarizability [3, 4]. On the other hand,
bosonic isotopes with no nuclear spin and a higher nat-
ural isotopic abundance avoid multiple hyperﬁne com-
ponents but lack direct excitation of the clock transition
|1i ↔ |2i in Fig. 1(a). Indirect excitation via continuous-
wave Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT)
has been proposed to probe these forbidden transitions
[10, 11]. A similar scheme to observe the 174Yb forbid-
den clock transition was implemented by applying a dc
magnetic ﬁeld for state mixing [6].

All such schemes can suﬀer from ac Stark shifts due
to non-resonant electric-dipole couplings of the clock lev-
els to other states induced by the applied electromag-
netic ﬁelds [12, 13]. Ref.
[10] provides some detailed
calculations of these shifts. To further reduce this po-
tential systematic error, we may suppose we could apply
an approach similar to that used for the determination
of the magic wavelength [3, 4] or the hyperpolarizabil-
ity contribution to the ac Stark shifts [5]: Measurements
at diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths are used to extrapolate the
clock frequency to vanishing ﬁeld. However, this sim-
ple approach does not apply to the EIT-related schemes
where the applied ﬁeld strength modiﬁes also the optical
pumping time required to prepare the atoms in a coher-
ent superposition [14]. The preparation time required for
optimal signal contrast and clock stability becomes un-
practically long at low ﬁeld strengths. But using large
ﬁelds increases the ac Stark shifts and limits the clock

accuracy. To overcome these limits, the pulsed scheme
proposed in this Letter (Fig. 1(c)) optimizes clock perfor-
mance by utilizing time-separated laser pulses to prepare
and interrogate the optical clock transition [15].
It is
an original mix of Ramsey phase spectroscopy [16] and
highly eﬃcient population transfer under Coherent Pop-
ulation Trapping (CPT) [17]. The ﬁrst pulse prepares
atoms in a coherent superposition and the second pulse
probes the clock frequency. This conﬁguration produces
a large contrast in the detected clock signal. More im-
portantly, as the detunings of the applied ﬁelds aﬀect the
phase evolution of the atomic wave-function, a proper
combination of the common mode laser detuning ∆0 and
pulse durations τ, τm reduces the clock shift to ∼ 10−17.
The discussion presented here reveals for the ﬁrst time a
general relation connecting the preparation time of the
Raman coherence and the signal contrast in the subse-

where Ω1 and Ω2 are the Rabi frequencies for the tran-
sitions 1S0 ↔ 1P1 and 3P0 ↔ 1P1. In Eq. (1), the dark
state |ΨN Ci remains insensitive to light shift, while the
bright state |ΨCi is always coupled to the laser light.
A realistic atomic clock has to deal with oﬀ-resonant ac
Stark shifts acting on |ΨCi while atoms are pumped into
|ΨN Ci with a few spontaneous emission cycles. Thus, a
judicious trade-oﬀ between the short-time dynamics for
a high-contrast signal (large optical pumping) and the
reduced external ac shifts (and resonance power broad-
enings) under a low ﬁeld strength needs to be found for
practical realizations of these EIT/Raman-type clocks.

To describe our pulsed method, we start from a three-
level conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 1(a). We focus our
calculations on 88Sr, but the approach applies to simi-
lar systems in Yb, Ca, Mg, or Hg, as well as ions. The
Optical Bloch Equations (OBEs) describe three-level dy-
namics including external shifts, relaxations, and deco-
herences between atomic states [18] in terms of the den-
sity matrix:

The relaxation matrix includes the spontaneous emission
rates Γ = Γ31+Γ32, optical decoherences γc1, γc2, and the
Raman decoherence γc (see Fig. 1(a)). Electric and/or
magnetic dipole couplings determine the Rabi frequencies
Ωi (i = 1, 2). Eq. (2) describes the dynamics of a closed
Λ-system where optical detunings ∆i include ac Stark
shifts ηi from non-resonant electric-dipole couplings of |1i
and |2i to other states. For Ω1, Ω2 . Γ31, Γ32, γc1, γc2,
the population in state |3i is slaved to the population
diﬀerence ∆n(t) ≡ ρ22(t) − ρ11(t) and Raman coher-
ence ρ12(t). This allows ﬁnding analytical solutions to
Eq. (2) by adiabatic elimination of the intermediate state
|3i [19, 20]. The reduced two-level system dynamics are
described by a Bloch-vector representation [21, 22].

To remove ac Stark shifts while maintaining a high
signal contrast, we apply the Ramsey technique of sepa-
rated oscillating EIT/Raman ﬁelds to this eﬀective two-
level system, minimizing systematic frequency shifts over
the free-evolution time T . The Ramsey-like sequence of
preparation, free-evolution, and probe, followed by the ﬁ-
nal destructive detection of the ground state population,

is indicated in Fig. 1(c). This eliminates power broad-
ening of the clock transition which is always present for
continuous excitation [23]. By solving for the two-level
system using the methods in [22] we can express the pop-
ulations as

where αii(τ, τm) is the overall envelope function and
βii(τ, τm) is the amplitude of fringes, both containing
exponential decays e−τ /τp and e−τm/τp to their steady
states [21]. τp is the characteristic optical pumping time.

which includes all ac Stark contributions accumulated
during the pulsed interactions. Hence, a longer free-
evolution time T reduces the light shifts on the clock
transition. Furthermore, as will be shown below, a
special value (∆0)m of the common detuning ∆0 can
be found to suppress ac Stark eﬀects on the clock fre-
quency. Study of the population dynamics from Eq. (4)
leads to an expression for the time τp that is required to
pump atoms into their ﬁnal steady state, simpliﬁed for

Here Υ = (Γ31 − Γ32) /Γ is the branching ratio diﬀerence
for the intermediate state which scales the contribution
of each Rabi frequency to the pumping rate τ −1
p . We
emphasize the importance of this time scale as it deter-
mines experimental protocols for detecting the EIT or
CPT response in either transient or steady states. Pre-
vious work on EIT or CPT concentrates mainly on the
symmetric case with Υ = 0. But in the case of alka-
line earths where Υ ∼ ±1, Eq. (6) shows that the Rabi
frequency associated with the weaker transition dictates
τp. For the 88Sr lattice clock where Γ31 = 2π × 32 MHz
≫ Γ32 = 2π × 620 Hz (i.e. Υ ∼ 1), the pumping time

FIG. 3: Time diluted optical frequency shift (Eq. (5) and
Eq. (9)) arising from oﬀ-resonance ac Stark shift contributions
to the 1S0 ↔ 3P0 transition under diﬀerent optical detunings
∆0. (a) Three diﬀerent cases of pulse durations τ = τm are
shown, under T = 1 s and Ω1/Ω2 = 8. Numerical calculations
based on Eq. (2) (solid dots) agree with the analytical results
from the wave function formalism. (b) Same as (a) except
Ω1/Ω2 = 15.16, showing Stark shift cancelation near (∆0)m =
80 MHz. The pumping time at resonance is ﬁxed at τp(0) =
5 s and the common Rabi frequency is Ω =
Γ/4τp(0). (c)
A zoomed-in plot of δν versus ∆0, with the slope reduced
for a longer T . The location of the common crossing point is
(∆0)m. (d) δν under diﬀerent τ around (∆0)m. The crossings
(shown as solid dots) between lines indicate that the same δν
is obtained for diﬀerent values of τ .

p

at resonance τp(0) is determined by the magnetic dipole
coupling Ω2 between 3P0 and 1P1. Figure 2 shows the de-
pendence of τp(0) on each Rabi frequency while keeping
the other one ﬁxed. The dotted lines are the correspond-
ing diﬀerential ac Stark shift of the clock frequency in the
steady state regime. Note that small ac Stark shifts cor-
respond to long optical pumping times conﬂicting with
realistic clock duty cycles. For instance, the proposal by
[10] with ac Stark shift below 21.7 mHz for an accuracy
of 2 × 10−17 leads to a signal contrast of a few % only
after 160 s. The scheme presented here ﬁnds a combi-
nation of parameters that maximizes contrast while sup-
pressing ac Stark shifts, exploiting the transient dynam-
ics for short pulses and detuned laser ﬁelds. Note that
due to the highly asymmetric Υ, this scheme can uniquely
exploit ground-state detection with a high-contrast nar-
row resonance manifested in the population transfer [24].
In the region of detuning between Raman spectroscopy
(∆0/Γ ≫ 1) and EIT/CPT (∆0/Γ ≪ 1), we ﬁnd con-
trasts of up to 60%, even though τ ≪ τp(∆0) ≃ 100 s.
This same approach could be extended easily to the four
level scheme [11], the magnetic induced optical transition
[6](with the magnetic ﬁeld and the common detuning as
operational parameters), or any other clock conﬁgura-
tions involving dark states.

The small diﬀerence between the ﬁeld-free clock de-

3

tuning δr and the ac Stark shifted detuning ∆1 − ∆2 =
(η1 − η2) + δr under laser ﬁelds leads to a small phase
shift of the Ramsey-EIT fringe deﬁned by Φ(τ, τm) in
Eq. (5) [19, 20]. Using numerical solution based on den-
sity matrix formalism we ﬁnd that a judicious choice of
the laser detuning (∆0)m cancels the external ac Stark
shifts, minimizing the inﬂuence to the clock transition
when high ﬁeld strengths are used to rapidly drive EIT
resonances. To conﬁrm these results, we also establish an
analytical expression for Φ(τ, τm) based on the atomic
wave-function formalism [25], using the Hamiltonian of
Eq. (3) keeping only the term −iΓ/2 associated with
spontaneous relaxation [26, 27] and neglecting all lat-
tice decoherences. By adiabatic elimination of state |3i,
within an eﬀective two-level system including only the
clock states |1i and |2i, the amplitudes evolve with a ma-
trix M , generalized from Ref.[28] by assuming ∆1 6= ∆2:

The atomic phase depends not only on the wave-function
coeﬃcients of the atomic evolution but also on the steady
states included in the closed density matrix equations
[30]. However, when short pulses τ, τm ≪ τp(∆0) are
applied, stationary solutions can be ignored. For initial
condition ρ11(0) = 1, ρ22(0) = 0, we ﬁnd an expression
for the atomic phase related to the clock frequency shift:

We are able to ﬁnd values of (∆0)m where the clock shift
is suppressed for diﬀerent practical choices of Rabi fre-
quencies Ωi. Fig. 3(a) plots the clock frequency shift
(δν as deﬁned in Eq. (5)) versus ∆0 under three dif-
ferent cases of τ = τm, with T = 1 s and Ω1/Ω2 = 8.
The dots show numerical results from Eq. (2) and solid
curves are analytical results from Eq. (9). Here, we ﬁnd
a non-vanishing δν under all conditions. However, as the
ratio of Ω1/Ω2 increases, we do ﬁnd both approaches give
the same value of (∆0)m where clock shift is suppressed,
as indicated in Fig. 3(b). When diﬀerent free evolution
times (T ) or pulse durations (τ = τm) are used, the accu-
mulated phase shift changes, leading to variations in the
dependence of δν on ∆0, as shown in the expanded view
of Fig. 3(c) and (d). To determine the optimum value of
(∆0)m for a practical clock realization at τ = 1 s, we can

use two diﬀerent techniques. First, as shown in Fig. 3(c),
extending T reduces the sensitivity of δν on ∆0. Hence,
the curves depicting δν versus ∆0 for diﬀerent T rotate
around (∆0)m, with no changes in the signal contrast. In
the second approach, as shown in Fig. 3(d), we ﬁnd the
values of ∆0 where δν for τ = 1 s is the same as that
for some other values of τ (< 1 s). These values of ∆0
can be plotted as a function of τ and extrapolated to τ
= 0 to ﬁnd (∆0)m. However, the signal contrast under
smaller τ is reduced due to the eﬀect of pulse prepara-
tion on population transfer. We have also determined the
sensitivity of δν to laser intensities (Ωi) and detunings,
demonstrating that the uncertainty of the optical clock
frequency <5 mHz (∼ 10−17) is achievable by controlling
∆0 at the 100 kHz level around (∆0)m. Meanwhile, Ωi

4

ﬂuctuations should be controlled <0.5%. We note that
for a given set of τ and Ωi, diﬀerent values of (∆0)m can
be found. For example, (∆0)m = 200 MHz is another
optimum value for larger Ωi (Fig. 4 (b)). In this case,
the signal contrast is further improved with a population
transfer of up to 60%, leading to enhanced clock stability
but also slightly larger uncertainty.

 

From Eq. (4) we ﬁnd spectral lineshapes and transi-
tion probabilities as a function of the experimental pa-
rameter δr, shown in Fig. 4. Since τ ≪ τp(∆0), the
two-photon resonance has a Fourier transform linewidth
given by the duration τ where power broadening eﬀects
have been eliminated. The spectra also exhibit the typi-
cal coherent Ramsey nutations with period ∼ 1/2T and
a central fringe free from systematic shifts.

In summary, our method achieves the 10−17 accu-
racy expected for a “light-insensitive” lattice clock with
EIT/Raman pulses to dilute ﬂuctuations of the frequency
shift over the free evolution time T . We show that a con-
trast between 20% to 60% (Fig. 4) could be achieved,
also including realistic lattice decoherence times [4]. Ex-
tensions are possible to the proposal of [11] by replacing
the 1P1 state with 3P1, to magnetic ﬁeld induced optical
transitions [6], for other species like 52Cr [31], and for nu-
clear clock transitions [32]. As a general technique, the
pulse approach is applicable to multi-photon excitation
paths where dark states are used as clock transitions.

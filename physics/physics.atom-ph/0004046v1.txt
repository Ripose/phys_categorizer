Nonlinear, ground-state, pump-probe spectroscopy

Physics Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1120

P. R. Berman and B. Dubetsky

(September 24, 2013)

A theory of pump-probe spectroscopy is developed in which optical ﬁelds drive two-quantum,
Raman-like transitions between ground state sublevels. Three ﬁelds are incident on an ensemble of
atoms. Two of the ﬁelds act as the pump ﬁeld for the two-quantum transitions. The absorption or
gain of an additional probe ﬁeld is monitored as a function of its detuning from one of the ﬁelds which
constitutes the pump ﬁeld. Although the probe absorption spectrum displays features common to
those found in pump-probe spectroscopy of single-quantum transitions, new interference eﬀects are
found to modify the spectrum. Many of these features can be explained within the context of a
dressed atom picture.

I. INTRODUCTION

Of fundamental interest in nonlinear spectroscopy is the response of an atomic vapor to the simultaneous application
of a pump and a probe ﬁeld. A calculation of the probe ﬁeld absorption is relatively straightforward [1,2] in the weak
probe ﬁeld limit. Let Ω and Ω′ denote the pump and probe ﬁeld frequencies, ∆ = Ω − ω the pump ﬁeld detuning
from atomic resonance ω, and δ1 = Ω′ − Ω the probe-pump detuning. For a pump ﬁeld detuning |∆| ≫ γe, χ, where
γe is the upper state decay rate and χ is a pump-ﬁeld Rabi frequency, one ﬁnds the spectrum to consist of three
components. There is an absorption peak centered near δ1 = −∆ (Ω′ = ω), an emission peak centered near δ1 = ∆
(Ω′ = 2Ω − ω) and a dispersive like structure centered near δ1 = 0. Experimentally, a spectrum exhibiting all these
features was ﬁrst obtained by Wu et al. [3]. The absorption and emission peaks can be given a simple interpretation
in a dressed-atom picture [4], but the non-secular structure centered at δ1 = 0 is somewhat more diﬃcult to interpret
[5,6]. The width of these spectral components is on the order of γe, neglecting any Doppler broadening.

The spectral response can change dramatically when atomic recoil accompanying the absorption or emission of
radiation becomes a factor [7], as in the case of a highly collimated atomic beam or for atoms cooled below the recoil
limit. In this limit, the absorption and emission peaks are each replaced by an absorption-emission doublet, and the
dispersive-like structure is replaced by a pair of absorption-emission doublets. The spectrum can be given a simple
interpretation in terms of a dressed atom theory, including quantization of the atoms’ center-of-mass motion [7]. It
turns out, however, that at most one absorption-emission doublet (one of the central ones) can be resolved unless
the excited state decay rate is smaller than the recoil shift. Since this condition is violated for allowed electronic
transitions, it is of some interest to look for alternative level schemes in which this structure can be resolved fully.
If the optical transitions are replaced by two-photon, Raman-like transitions between ground state levels, the widths
of the various spectral components are determined by ground state relaxation rates, rather than excited state decay
rates. As a result, the probe’s spectral response should be fully resolvable. Raman processes have taken on added
importance in sub-Doppler [8] and sub-recoil [9] cooling, atom focusing [10], atom interferometry [11–14], and as a
method for probing Bose condensates [15].

In this article we propose a scheme for pump-probe spectroscopy of an atomic vapor using Raman transitions.
This is but one of a class of interactions that can be considered under the general heading of nonlinear ground state
spectroscopy. The spectral response is found to be similar to that of traditional pump-probe spectroscopy [1]; however,
new interference phenomena can modify the spectrum [Sec. III]. The interference phenomena can be interpreted in
terms of a dressed atom picture [Sec. IV]. Although part of the motivation for this work is the study of recoil eﬀects,
such eﬀects are neglected in this article.

II. EQUATIONS OF MOTION

The atom ﬁeld geometry is indicated schematically in Fig. 1. Three-level atoms interact with two optical ﬁelds, E1
and E2, producing strong coupling between initial and ﬁnal levels 1 and 2 via an intermediate excited state level e.
Field E1 couples only levels 1 and e, while ﬁeld E2 couples only levels 2 and e. In addition, there is a weak probe
ﬁeld E that couples only levels 1 and e. As a consequence, ﬁelds E and E2 can also drive two-photon transitions

between levels 1 and 2. Levels 1 and 2 are pumped incoherently at rates Λ1 and Λ2, respectively, and both states
decay at rate Γ. The incoherent pumping and decay represent an oversimpliﬁed model for atoms entering and leaving
the interaction volume. The incident ﬁelds are assumed to be nearly copropagating so that all two-photon Doppler
shifts can be neglected. In this limit and in the limit of large detuning on each single photon transition, one can
consider the atoms to be stationary with regards to their interaction with the external ﬁelds. We wish to calculate
the linear probe absorption spectrum.
The electric ﬁeld can be written as

E (R,t) =

2 hE1ei(k1·R−Ω1t) + E2ei(k2·R−Ω2t) + Eei(k·R−Ωt)i + c.c.,

(1)

where Ω1, Ω2, and Ω are the ﬁeld frequencies, k1, k2, and k the ﬁeld propagation vectors, and c.c. stands for complex
conjugate. In an interaction representation, neglecting any decay or incoherent pumping of the ground state levels,
the state probability amplitudes obey the equations of motion.

i ˙ae = χ1e−i∆1ta1 + χ2e−i∆2ta2 + χe−i∆ta2 − i (γe/2) ae,

the magnitude of the detunings are much larger than γe and any Doppler shifts associated with the single photon
transitions, it is possible to adiabatically eliminate the excited state amplitude to arrive at the following equations
for the ground state amplitudes:

i ˙a1 = S1a1 + S(cid:0)eiδ1t + e−iδ1t(cid:1) a1 + ge−i˜δta2 + g′e−iδ′ta2;

where the incoherent pumping and decay terms have been introduced. It is important to note that, in this represen-
tation, the frequency appearing in the g′ terms is δ1 = δ′ − ˜δ = Ω − Ω1. In other words, the eﬀective ﬁeld frequency
associated with ﬁeld E2 in this representation is Ω1 rather than Ω2.

If η ≪ 1, the two-quantum probe absorption spectrum has the same structure as the probe absorption spectrum
involving single quantum transitions. The situation changes if η >
∼ 1. For example, aside from an interchange of
absorption and gain components as a function of δ1, the probe spectrum for single quantum transitions depends only
on the magnitude of the pump ﬁeld detuning. This is clearly not the case for two-quantum transitions, as is evident
from Fig. 2(a) drawn for η = 1, Γ/g = 0.1, δ/g = ±1. Probe absorption and gain are interchanged when δ changes
sign, but the ratio of the amplitude of the absorption to gain peak changes when δ changes sign. There is another
subtle diﬀerence present in these spectra. The sense of the central dispersive component is opposite to that for single
quantum transitions. With decreasing η , the sense of the central component would reverse, as the spectrum reverts
to the same structure found in pump-probe spectroscopy of single quantum transitions. The probe response also
depends on the sign of ∆ (through g = χ1χ2/∆); this feature follows from the dependence of the spectrum on the
sign of δ and the relationship

which can be derived using Eqs. (A3)-(A7) of Appendix A. It is also possible for the components centered at positive
or negative δ1 to vanish (in the secular approximation) for certain values of η, as can be seen in Fig. 2(b).

FIG. 2. Probe ﬁeld absorption in arbitrary units. Positive ordinate values correspond to probe absorption and negative

values to probe gain.

The case of δ/g = 0 is shown in Fig. 2(c) for η = 1/5, 1,5, and ∆ > 0. If η = 1/5, the spectrum is similar to that
found for single quantum transitions [1]. For η = 1, the spectral component at negative δ1 is found to vanish. When
η >
∼ 1, there is a dispersive-like structure centered at δ1 = 0 that is not found in the pump-probe spectroscopy of
single quantum transitions. Expressions for the three components are given in Eqs. (A8) of Appendix A for |g| ≫ Γ,
Γ ≪ η2.

III. DRESSED ATOM APPROACH

The spectral features seen in Figs. 2 (a),(b) can be explained using a dressed atom approach. Semiclassical dressed

states for two-quantum transitions can be introduced via the transformation [16]

|Bi (cid:19) = T(cid:18) |1i
(cid:18) |Ai

|2i (cid:19) ;

T = (cid:18) cos (θ) −ψ sin (θ)

(17)

(18)

The angle θ is restricted such that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/4 for δ > 0 and π/4 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 for δ < 0. For θ ∼ 0 (δ > 0, |g/δ| ≪ 1),
|Ai ∼ |1i, while for θ ∼ π/2 (δ < 0, |g/δ| ≪ 1), |Bi ∼ |1i. In the secular approximation,

it follows from Eqs. (9) and (15) that, to zeroth order in the probe ﬁeld, the diagonal dressed state density matrix
elements are given by

Γ ≪ ωBA,

(19)

ρ(0)
AA = (Λ1/Γ) cos2(θ) + (Λ2/Γ) sin2(θ) ≡ ΛA/Γ;
ρ(0)
BB = (Λ2/Γ) cos2(θ) + (Λ1/Γ) sin2(θ) ≡ ΛB/Γ;
ρ(0)
AA − ρ(0)
BB = (ΛA − ΛB) /Γ = [(Λ1 − Λ2)/Γ] cos(2θ); .

(20a)

(20b)

(20c)

Note that (cid:16)ρ(0)

AA − ρ(0)

BB(cid:17) has the same sign as (Λ1 − Λ2) if δ > 0 and the opposite sign if δ < 0.

It is now possible to use the energy level diagram (Fig. 3) to read directly the probe absorption spectrum. The
probe ﬁeld is absorbed (or ampliﬁed) via two quantum transitions between states |Ai and |Bi. The two quantum
transitions involve one photon from the probe ﬁeld and one photon from either ﬁeld E1 or E2, since all of these ﬁelds
couple states |Ai and |Bi to state |ei. It is important to remember that the eﬀective ﬁeld frequency of ﬁeld E2 is
equal to Ω1 in this interaction representation. Fields E1 and E couple state |ei to the components of states |Ai and
|Bi involving state |1i, while ﬁeld E2 couples state |ei to the components of states |Ai and |Bi involving state |2i.
For example the matrix element for the two-quantum process from state |Ai to |Bi involving absorption of a probe
photon and emission of a ﬁeld E2 photon is

−iχ

Γ − i(δ1 − ωBA)

while that for absorption of a probe photon and emission of a ﬁeld E1 photon is

−iχ

These two processes add coherently, such that probe absorption via transitions from state |Ai to |Bi is proportional

to the sum of these two matrix elements squared, multiplied by the population diﬀerence (cid:16)ρ(0)

words, the probe absorption at δ1 = ωBA is proportional to a quantity C+ given by

FIG. 3. Dressed-state energy level diagram. In the interaction representation adopted in the text, the frequency of ﬁeld E2
must be set equal to Ω1 in calculating resonance conditions. For (ΛA − ΛB) > 0, solid arrows correspond to probe absorption
centered at δ1 = ωBA and dashed arrows correspond to probe gain centered at δ1 = −ωBA.

Similarly, probe gain via transitions from state |Ai to |Bi at δ1 = −ωBA is proportional to

A formal derivation of these results is given in Appendix B.

(21)

(22)

For the sake of deﬁniteness, let us take (Λ1 − Λ2) > 0; then C+ corresponds to absorption for δ > 0 and to gain
for δ < 0, while C− corresponds to gain for δ > 0 and to absorption for δ < 0. Note that the component centered
at δ1 = −ωBA vanishes if ∆ > 0 and tan(θ) = η2, while that at δ1 = ωBA vanishes if ∆ < 0 and tan(θ) = η−2. The

values of A± = ±C±(cid:2)Γ2∆/ |g| (Λ1 − Λ2)(cid:3) are plotted in Fig. 4 as a function of δ/g for ∆ > 0 and η = 1, 2. For

∆ < 0, one can use the relationship A±(−∆, −δ) = ∓A∓(∆, δ).

Positive values of A± correspond to absorption and negative values to gain.

One sees that the interference between two channels for absorption and emission plays an important role. This
interference arises only for a semiclassical description of the pump ﬁelds. If pump ﬁelds E1 and E2 are quantized and
in pure number states, this interference does not occur, since the ﬁnal states for the two channels are orthogonal.

broad open arrows ﬁeld E2. (a) absorption, (b) gain. Terms involving the sequential absorption and emission of the same ﬁeld
have been neglected, since such terms result only in Stark shifts of levels 1 and 2. The diagrams are drawn for ˜δ > 0; if ˜δ < 0,
the roles of absorption and gain would be interchanged.

The probe absorption vanishes in the secular approximation (19) when δ = 0, since, in this case, θ = π

4 and the
populations of the dressed states are equal. The lowest order dressed atom approach is not useful in this limit. Typical
spectra are shown in Fig. 2 (c) and were discussed in Sec. III.

IV. CONCLUSION

The probe absorption spectrum has been calculated for two-quantum transitions between levels that are simulta-
neously driven by a two-quantum pump ﬁeld of arbitrary intensity. In addition to features found in conventional
pump-probe spectroscopy of single quantum transitions, new features have been found that can be identiﬁed with
interference phenomena. Both Doppler and recoil eﬀects were neglected in out treatment. For nearly copropagating
ﬁelds, eﬀects arising from these processes are negligible. Doppler shifts can be accounted for by the replacements
δ1 → δ1 + (k1 − k) · v, δ1 − ˜δ → δ1 − ˜δ + (k2 − k) · v, and δ1 + ˜δ → δ1 + ˜δ + (2k1 − k2 − k) · v in the equations in the
Appendix.

The dependence of the interference eﬀect of the signs of ∆ and ˜δ can be understood in the bare atom picture in a
perturbative limit. A schematic representation of the probability amplitude leading to probe absorption at δ1 = ˜δ is
shown in Fig. 5(a). Each arrow represents an interaction with one of the ﬁelds. The two contributions to the ﬁnal
state amplitude add coherently. Putting in the appropriate energy denominators, one ﬁnds that the absorption varies

New eﬀects will arise if the ﬁelds are not copropagating and the active medium is a subrecoil cooled atomic vapor,
a highly collimated atomic beam, or a BEC. As for single quantum transitions [7], each component of the spectrum
undergoes recoil splitting. Since the center-of-mass momentum states diﬀer for two-quantum processes involving ﬁelds
E1 and E from those involving ﬁelds E2 and E, one would expect a spectrum consisting of 8 absorption and 8 gain
components.

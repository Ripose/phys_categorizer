Abstract

We report on the ﬁrst observation of resonance structure in the total cross
section for the photodetachment of Li−. The structure arises from the autode-
taching decay of doubly excited 1P o states of Li− that are bound with respect
to the 3p state of the Li atom. Calculations have been performed for both Li−
and H− to assist in the identiﬁcation of these resonances. The lowest lying
resonance is analogous to the previously observed symmetrically excited in-
trashell resonance in H− but it is much broader. Higher lying resonant states
are observed to converge on the Li(3p)limit. These Rydberg-like resonances
are much narrower and correspond to asymmetrically excited intershell states.

Processes such as double excitation and ionization of few-electron atomic systems provide
valuable insights into the dynamics of the electron-electron correlation [1]. Double excitation
has been studied in experiments involving photon-, electron- and heavy particle impact on
atoms and ions. Photoexcitation, although restricted by the electric dipol selection rules,
provides the potential for the highest energy resolution which is of considerable importance
in the investigation of narrow and closely spaced resonance structures. In these investigations
the helium atom has been the most studied system [2,3]. Negative ions, however, are more
sensitive to correlation eﬀects than corresponding isoelectronic atoms or positive ions since
for this member of a sequence the core ﬁeld is weakest and therefore the masking of the
subtler interelectronic interaction is reduced. The photo-double excitation of a negative ion
involves the simultaneous promotion of a pair of electrons to relatively large distances from
a singly-charged core. Under this condition the interaction between the pair of electrons can
become comparable in strength to the weakened interaction of each electron with the core.
The motion of the excited electrons then becomes highly correlated and the independent
electron model ceases to be a valid approximation.

Until recently, most investigations of photo-double excitation in negative ions involved
the H− ion. Experimental studies of photodetachment in this prototype anion have been
reported by Bryant and co-workers [4,5] and several computational techniques [6–10] have
been applied to account for the observed resonance structure. Negative ions of heavier alkali
metals has also been studied [11].

In this paper we report on the ﬁrst observation of resonance structure in the total cross
section for the photodetachment of Li−. The resonances are of 1P o ﬁnal state symmetry and
are optically coupled to the ground state. They arise from the photoexcitation and subse-
quent autodetaching decay of doubly-excited states of Li− that are embedded in continua
representing an excited Li atom and a free electron. The resonances were observed to lie
in the energy region between the Li(3s) and Li(3p) thresholds. Recently Pan, Starace and
Greene used an eigenchannel R-matrix method to predict the shape of the photodetachment
cross section in the vicinity of the Li(n = 3) threshold [12] and the Li(n = 4, 5, 6) thresholds
[13]. The measurements reported here present us with an opportunity to compare experi-
mental data on Li− with corresponding data on H− [4]. Diﬀerences in the spectra of Li− and
H− associated with the lifting of the degeneracy characteristic of the H-atom are apparent
as are certain similarities. We present also new calculations on Li− and H− which are used
to explain the origin of the observed resonances. The method accounts for full correlation
between the outer electrons and the autodetaching decay of doubly excited states is treated
using complex rotation.

Experimental investigations of narrow and relatively weak resonance structure in total
photodetachment cross sections demand measurements of both high sensitivity and resolu-
tion. These conditions were achieved in the present experiment by the use of a collinear beam
apparatus, described in detail elsewhere [14], in which a tenuous beam of Li− is superposed
with a laser beam over a common path of about 50 cm (see Fig.1).

The energy resolution of our apparatus has in a recent experiment [15] been shown to
In the present experiment the laser linewidth

corresponds to an energy resolution of 25 µeV.

regions. Two quadrupole deﬂectors (Q.D.) are used to merge the two beams.

Li−-ions were generated in a hot-plasma type ion source and accelerated to 4 keV. The
tunable ultraviolet radiation used to transiently produce the doubly excited state by pho-
toabsorption from the Li− ground state was generated by frequency doubling of the fun-
damental output of a XeCl excimer-pumped dye laser. Neutral Li atoms produced by
photodetachment were separated from Li− ions by means of an electrostatic quadrupole
deﬂector (Q.D.) and detected. The neutral atom detector consisted of a glass plate (coated
with a thin layer of In2O3 : Sn to prevent charge build up) and a channel electron multiplier
(CEM) that was employed to count the secondary electrons produced by the impact of the
neutrals on the plate.

FIG. 2. Total photodetachment cross section for Li− in the region between the 3s and 3p
thresholds. The dots represent the experimental data while the solid line represents the theoretical
result. The inset shows an expansion of the region around the 3p-threshold.

Two sources of background became evident in the experiment. A contribution from
neutrals produced by the detachment in collisions with the residual gas in the experimental
chamber was rendered essentially negligible by maintaining a vacuum of about 10−9 mbar.
A potentially more serious background source, however, was associated with photoelectrons
generated on the glass plate of the neutral atom detector by the pulsed uv radiation. This
contribution was greatly reduced by modulating the bias on a grid placed between the glass
plate and the CEM. For a short time after the arrival of the laser pulse, a grid voltage of
- 40 eV was used to prevent the background photoelectrons from reaching the CEM. The
grid voltage was reduced to zero about 0.5 µs after the laser pulse (the shortest ﬂight time

of the neutrals from the interaction region to the glass plate) in order to detect the neutrals
constituting the signal. This gated detection procedure signiﬁcantly enhanced the sensitivity
of the measurement. The neutral atom signal, normalized to the intensities of the ion and
photon beams, was used as a monitor of the relative total photdetachment cross section.

The experimentally determined total photodetachment cross section is shown as the dots
in Fig.2. All data points have been normalized to the theoretically calculated value at the
3p threshold. The scatter in the data is primarily caused by the small but unavoidable
change in the overlap of the ion and laser beams as the wavelength of the laser was scanned.
The normalization procedure was unable to account for the beam overlap variation. We
estimated, however, that this eﬀect causes a maximum error in the relative cross section
over the whole spectrum of less than 10%. The statistical scatter, mainly caused by the
shot noise in counting of the neutral particles, is less than 3%. The experimental data
exhibits three signiﬁcant features. There is a small and narrow dip in the cross section just
at the 3p threshold which we interpret as the Wigner cusp arising from the opening of a
new photodetachment channel. Second, there is a narrow resonance structure just below the
threshold and, ﬁnally, a very broad resonance occupies a large part of the region between
the Li(3s) and Li(3p) thresholds.

In order to explain the origin of the resonances in the observed cross section, we have
calculated the expected spectrum of resonances in the photodetachment cross section of Li−.
We have also made a calculation of H− for the purpose of identifying diﬀerences associated
with the presence or absence of a ﬁnite core. The calculated cross sections for Li− and H− are
shown in Fig.2 and Fig.3, respectively, and the parameters associated with the intrashell,
(n = N), resonance (the broad resonance) in each spectrum are listed in Table I. The
calculation exploits a recently developed approach [16] which combines complex rotation,
where the radial coordinates are scaled with a complex constant r → reiθ, with the use of a
discrete numerical basis set [17].

The ground states of Li− and H− were calculated by use of perturbation theory while
a representation of the spectrum of ﬁnal states was obtained by diagonalization of the
matrix for the interaction between the two outer electrons. This procedure yields a two-
particle basis set which includes both doubly excited states, coupled to the continuum, and
bound-continuum states. To construct the matrix we have typically used 1400 basis set
combinations, including both continuum and bound orbitals, but the selection was limited
to sp, pd, and df symmetries. The number of partial waves included is the only important
approximation for H− and determines the number of digits given in Table I. For Li−, approx-
imations are also made concerning the interaction between the core and the outer electrons.
Our one-particle basis set consists of Hartree-Fock orbitals obtained in the potential arising
from the 1s2 core plus a non-local polarization potential which accounts for the dominating
correlation eﬀects in neutral Li. Except for this correction the core is assumed to be inert.
The eigenvectors of the matrix are denoted Ψn and they constitute a discretized description
of the correlated ﬁnal states. Some of these states are rather localized doubly excited states
and the real and imaginary parts of their complex eigenvalues correspond to their energy,
Er, and halfwidth, Γ/2, respectively. The remaining eigenvectors constitute a discretized
description of the bound-continuum channels.

The cross section for photodetachment in the complex rotation scheme has been discussed

by Rescigno and McKoy [18] and is calculated as

where each Ψn represents a correlated state with a complex energy, En = Er − iΓ/2. The
initial ground state is denoted by Ψ0. The usual expression which requires summation over
discrete ﬁnal states, Ψn, and integration over continuum states is replaced in this case by a
summation over the discretized two electron spectrum. The use of complex rotation allows
us to carry out the sum directly without any special considerations close to the poles in the
energy denominator.

The calculated cross section for Li− obtained using Eq. 1 is shown as the solid line
in Fig. 2. In general there is a good agreement with the experimental data. The major
discrepancy is in the height of the broad resonance, but this diﬀerence is within the estimated
experimental error. The resonance parameters, displayed in Table I, are obtained from the
complex eigenvalues of the resonant states. A simple connection between the resonance
parameters and the cross section can be established if the form of the latter was determined
by the resonant state alone. The cross section could then be approximated by the Fano
proﬁle [19];

σ(ω) = σ0

(q + ε)
1 + ε2

(2)

where ε = [¯hω−(Er − E0) ]/ (Γ/2), q is a shape parameter and ¯hω is the photon energy. This
expression is obtainable from Eq. 1 if the sum over all states is replaced by one particular
state. If the cross section is strongly inﬂuenced by more than one state, however, such a
description will certainly not be adequate and as a consequence it will then no longer be
possible to obtain the position and width of a particular doubly excited state from the total
cross section. This is indeed the situation in the studied region of the Li− spectrum.

The result of the H− calculation shown in Fig. 3, is in close agreement with other
calculations [8,10]. The lowest energy resonance is identiﬁed with a doubly excited state
that has a calculated energy of 12.647 eV (relative the H− ground state) and a width of
0.033 eV. These values again agree well with other calculations, such as the accurate results
obtained by Ho [9] using Hylleraas-type wave functions. It is also in agreement with the
resonance parameters obtained by the analysis, in form of a ﬁt to a Fano line shape, of
the experimental data by Hamm et al [4]. The comparison is displayed in Table I. This
resonant state is dominated by a few hydrogenic conﬁgurations; 3s3p(35%), 3p3d(31%) and
3p4d(11%).

In Fig.2 it is seen that for Li− a broad resonance occupies essentially the whole region
between the Li(3s) and Li(3p) thresholds. The calculated cross section is shown as a solid
line and is in close agreement with a recent R-Matrix calculation [12]. The present calculation
predicts a resonant state of width 0.36 eV to lie 4.32 eV above the ground state of Li−. This
state appears to be analogous to the symmetrically excited intrashell state in H−. It has a
very similar binding energy relative the double detachment limit, but is about one order of
magnitude broader. The broadening of the resonance in Li− arises from the strong coupling
to the 3sεp continuum, which is not available below H(n = 3) in H−. The resonant state in
Li− is dominated by the conﬁgurations 3p3d and 4s3p and there appears to be no signiﬁcant
contributions to the localized part of the wave function from conﬁgurations with one electron
in the 3s orbital , which is also in contrast to the case of H−.

While the H− intrashell resonance is well described by a Fano proﬁle the width of the
resonant state in Li− is too broad for this to be possible. The calculated width of 0.36 eV is
overlapping the 3p threshold as well as the narrow resonance seen just below it in Fig.2. The
latter resonance is due to asymmetrically excited Rydberg-like states. The presence of the
threshold and the interference between the resonances aﬀects the shape of the cross section
curve signiﬁcantly. The assumption necessary to obtain a Fano proﬁle, that only one state
determines the shape is thus not valid. The interference results in a narrowed structure in
the spectrum, especially on the high energy side, compared to that which would arise from a
hypothetically isolated doubly excited state of width 0.36 eV. Rydberg-like resonant states
are also apparent in the calculated spectrum of H−.

These states are bound relative H(n = 3) by the strong dipolar ﬁeld between the two
electrons arising due to the degeneracy of the H(3ℓ) states and resulting in nearly equal
admixtures of 3snp and 3pns (or 3pns and 3dnp) conﬁgurations their composition. The
Rydberg-like states in Li−, however, do not have this character. They are completely domi-
nated by 3pnℓ conﬁgurations, with n ≫ 3, and the dipolar ﬁeld is in this case insigniﬁcant.
The explanation for the existence of the Rydberg states in Li− is the inability of the monopole
part of the electron-electron interaction to screen the singly-charged core completely. The
residual nuclear attraction binds the states below the Li(3p) threshold.

To conclude, we have studied the total cross section for photodetaching an electron
from the Li− ion in the energy region between the 3s and 3p thresholds. This region is
dominated by a broad resonance. A narrower resonance structure lies just below the 3p
threshold . By comparing the data with calculated cross sections for Li− and H− we have
been able to identify the broad resonance in the Li− spectrum as being associated with
the presence of a symmetrically excited intrashell doubly excited state, analogous to, but
much broader than, the intrashell state in H−. The sharper resonance structure is identiﬁed

7

with asymmetrically excited Rydberg-like resonant states. Our intention is to extend the
measurements to higher lying resonances to further investigate the similarities and diﬀerences
between the photodetachment spectra of Li− and H−.

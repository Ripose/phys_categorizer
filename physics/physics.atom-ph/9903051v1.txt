We study numerically stabilization against ionization of a fully correlated two-electron model
atom in an intense laser pulse. We concentrate on two frequency regimes: very high frequency, where
the photon energy exceeds both, the ionization potential of the outer and the inner electron, and
an intermediate frequency where, from a “single active electron”-point of view the outer electron is
expected to stabilize but the inner one is not. Our results reveal that correlation reduces stabilization
when compared to results from single active electron-calculations. However, despite this destabilizing
eﬀect of electron correlation we still observe a decreasing ionization probability within a certain
intensity domain in the high-frequency case. We compare our results from the fully correlated
simulations with those from simpler, approximate models. This is useful for future work on “real”
more-than-one electron atoms, not yet accessible to numerical ab initio methods.

I. INTRODUCTION

The advent of high intensity lasers led to an increasing interest in non-perturbative studies of atomic systems
interacting with intense laser light (see, e.g., [1] for a review). One of the most frequently revisited topics during the
last ﬁfteen years was stabilization of atoms (or ions) against ionization in intense laser light, i.e., for increasing laser
intensity the ionization rate decreases. This kind of stabilization was predicted by Gersten and Mittleman already in
1975 [2]. Experimentally, stabilization of highly excited atoms has been reported [3] whereas measuring stabilization
of atoms initially in the ground state is hard to achieve. This is due to the fact that, in order to see stabilization,
the laser photon energy has to exceed the ionization potential. Unfortunately, there are not yet high intensity lasers
available delivering such energetic photons. Therefore most of the studies in this ﬁeld are of analytical or numerical
nature: “high-frequency theory” [4], stationary Floquet calculations [5], the numerical treatment of 1D model atoms,
quantum [6–9] and classical [10], as well as in two-color laser ﬁelds [11], 2D atoms in arbitrary polarized laser light
[12], and full 3D hydrogen [13]. Of particular interest is whether the atom survives in a “real” laser pulse up to
intensities where stabilization sets in, or whether it already ionizes almost 100% during the rise time of the pulse
[14]. In other words: is the atom able to pass through the “death valley” of ionization before arriving at the “magic
mountain” of stabilization? There are also several papers where the authors came to the conclusion that stabilization,
in a strict sense, does not exist at all (see [15,16], and references therein). Indeed, in our studies we also found that in
the limit of inﬁnite laser intensity the ionization probability seems always to approach unity, no matter how high the
laser frequency is. Therefore, if one deﬁnes stabilization as the “failure to achieve full ionization as the intensity is
indeﬁnitely increased for a pulse of ﬁxed frequency, phase, shape and duration” [16] we do not ﬁnd any stabilization.
However, in our opinion the decrease of the ionization rate within a certain intensity regime is worth to be called
stabilization. We are quite sure that there will be great experimental interest once lasers are available which deliver
suﬃciently high-frequency laser light.

In this paper we focus on how the electron correlation in a two-electron model atom aﬀects the probability for
stabilization, i.e., the probability that the model atom remains neutral after the pulse has passed by. For two
frequency regimes we compare the results from the fully correlated calculation with approximate models like “single
active electron” or time-dependent density functional theory. The purpose of these studies is, on one hand, to gain a
qualitative picture of the stabilization mechanism in a more-than-one electron atom, and, on the other hand, testing
approximate methods before applying them to 3D many-electron atoms where accurate, full ab initio studies are not
possible with current days computers. To our knowledge only a few other numerical studies of correlated two-electron
systems in the stabilization regime are reported in the literature so far [17,18].

To analyze the results obtained with this fully correlated model atom we compare with several simpliﬁed models.
Among those, the “single active electron” (SAE) approximation is the simplest one. There, one assumes that an
inner and an outer electron respond independently to the laser ﬁeld. The inner electron “feels” the bare nucleus
(Zi = 2, hydrogen-like). The outer one sees an eﬀective nuclear charge, to be adjusted in such a way that the correct
ionization potential (0.9 a.u.) is obtained. In our numerical model this was the case for Zo = 1.1. Thus, in the SAE
approximation, we solved two independent TDSEs with no dynamic correlation at all,

In this approximation, the inner electron feels the bare nuclear potential and the outer electron. Therefore, we call
this model “inner sees outer” (ISO) approximation. It was utilized in Ref. [21] to study non-sequential ionization
(NSI). In the ground state, the Hartree-potential leads to a screening of the bare nuclear charge. Thus, energetically
the two electrons are almost equivalent in the beginning, though we labelled them “inner” and “outer” in Eqs. (6),
(7). However, during the interaction with the laser ﬁeld one of the electrons might become the outer one. We will
also consider the opposite point of view where the outer electron sees the inner one (“outer sees inner”, OSI). In this
case we have to deal with the system of TDSEs

III. HIGH-FREQUENCY RESULTS

A. Single active electron-approximation

[

Ei >

In this Section we want to compare the results from the fully correlated model atom with those from the correspond-
ing SAE calculations. First, we focus on the high-frequency regime where the laser frequency exceeds both ionization
Eo. From an SAE-point of view we expect both electrons to stabilize, especially the outer
potentials, ω = π >
Eo = 0.9. In Fig. 1 the amount of probability
one since the frequency is 3.5 times larger than the ionization potential
5, +5] (PDIB) vs. time for ˆα = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 is shown for the inner and the
density inside the box x1, x2
outer electron. First we observe the expected result that the outer electron is more stabilized than the inner one: the
amount of PDIB after the pulse has gone is greater for the outer electron. However, qualitatively the set of curves
are quite similar. For the two higher ˆα-values (1.5, drawn dashed, and 2.0, drawn dashed-dotted) one observes that
the curves bend sharply after the up-ramping at t = 5 cycles, i.e., for both electrons ionization is much slower during
the constant, intense part of the pulse. In fact, ionization happens almost exclusively during the rampings. We also
note that the slight decrease of the PDIB during the constant part of the ˆα = 1.5 and ˆα = 2.0-pulses is linear in time,
in contrast to tunneling ionization where we have an exponential dependence (in the case of a constant ionization
rate). Approximately two cycles after the down-ramping at t = 10 cycles, ionization starts to increase again. Finally,
after the pulse is over (at t = 15 cycles) the amount of PDIB remains stationary. Secondly, we observe that there is
obviously no monotonous behavior of stabilization with increasing intensity (or ˆα). Ionization is higher for ˆα = 1.0
(dotted curves) than for ˆα = 0.5 (solid curves). For ˆα = 1.5 (dashed curves) ionization starts to decrease, i.e., we are
entering the stabilization domain at that point. Therefore the so-called “death valley” seems to be located around
ˆα = 1 for both electrons in our model atom.

In Fig. 2 the stabilization probability for both electrons is shown vs. the excursion ˆα. The quiver amplitude ˆα is
related to the laser intensity I = ˆE2 through ˆα = I 1/2ω−2. The stabilization probability of the inner electron exhibits
an oscillatory behavior. The “death valley” is located at ˆα
4. For higher intensity
≈
7. Stabilization of the inner electron recovers
ionization increases again up to a stabilization minimum around ˆα
till the next maximum at ˆα
9. The second maximum is below the ﬁrst. Thus we observe an overall decrease of
stabilization with increasing intensity. This is even more pronounced in the stabilization probability for the outer
electron where the oscillations are less visible. The “death valley” for both electrons is located at ˆα
1 while the
maxima are at diﬀerent positions. The oscillatory character of the stabilization probability in 1D systems has been
observed by other authors as well [23–25]. In contrast to our results an overall increase of stabilization with increasing
intensity was found in [23,24]. This might be due to the fact that we are looking at the ionization probability after
the pulse is over while in analytical papers often the ionization rate is discussed. In the former, ionization during the
up and down-ramps is taken into account while in the latter it is commonly not.

The probability for our He model atom to survive as neutral He after the pulse is over is, in SAE approximation,
simply the product of the probabilities for each electron to remain bound.
In Fig. 2 the corresponding curve is
o. The result from the fully correlated system is also shown (drawn dotted, indicated with ‘corr’). We
indicated by i
·

infer that, especially for ˆα < 5 the stabilization probability is strongly overestimated by the SAE treatment. We could
argue that if the system stabilizes it will probably stabilize in such a way that the correlation energy is minimized. In
that case it sounds more reasonable to take the square of the SAE stabilization probability for the inner electron. In
what follows we will refer to this viewpoint as “independent electron” (IE) model since it follows from crossing out the
correlation term in the Hamiltonian (2). The result is included in Fig. 2, labelled i
i. The IE-curve seems to oscillate
·
around the fully correlated one, especially for ˆα > 6. From this result we conclude that, compared to the IE-model
with two equivalent inner electrons, electron correlation washes out oscillations in the stabilization probability and,
therefore, can stabilize as well as destabilize, depending on the intensity (for a given pulse shape and frequency).

To discuss that further we look at the time-averaged Kramers-Henneberger potential (TAKHP), i.e., we transform
to the frame of reference where the quivering electron is at rest but the nuclear potential oscillates, and average over
one cycle,

For suﬃciently high frequencies this is the leading term in a perturbation series in ω−1 [4]. In the correlation term
no α(t) appears since the interparticle distance is not aﬀected by the KH transformation. We calculated numerically
the TAKHP. The result is shown in Fig. 3 for α(t) = ˆα sin ωt with ˆα = 5. For comparison the TAKHP with the
correlation term neglected is also shown (corresponding to the IE model). With correlation, there are two minima
ˆα, x2 = ˆα whereas without correlation there are two more, energetically equivalent
near x1 = ˆα, x2 =
minima at x1 = x2 = ˆα and x1 = x2 =
ˆα. However, if we assume that the fully correlated system manages it
−
somehow to occupy the ground state of V corr
KH , the correlation energy will be small (for not too small ˆα) since the
interparticle distance is 2 ˆα. The higher ˆα the lower the correlation energy. We believe that this is the physical reason
that, for increasing ˆα, the agreement of the IE results with the fully correlated ones becomes quite good (although the
latter do not exhibit an oscillating stabilization probability). Our viewpoint is further supported by examining the

electron correlation we do not observe four peaks. Instead the peaks at x1 = x2 =
with our discussion of the TAKHPs in Fig. 3. Therefore the correlation energy is rather small since the distance
between the two peaks in the x1x2-plane is √8 ˆα. In the work by Mittleman [26] such multi-electron “dichotomized”
bound states are calculated.

In Fig. 5 our results from the TDDFT calculations are presented. Although the Kohn-Sham orbital Φ(x, t) is an
auxillary entity that has, in a rigorous sense, no physical meaning, we take it as an approximation to a single electron
orbital. If we do this,
5 < x < 5 after the pulse is over, is our TDDFT
stabilization probability. We see that for ˆα < 1.5 the agreement between TDDFT and correct result is very good.
The diﬀerence between TDDFT and IE (indicated by i
i again) is a direct measure of correlation eﬀects since both

models diﬀer by the Hartree-term in the Hamiltonian only. Up to ˆα
compared to the IE approximation. In that region TDDFT agrees better with the full result. As mentioned before, for
higher ˆα the IE curve oscillates around the correct result and therefore it comes occasionly to a very good agreement
with the exact result. Also the TDDFT result agrees very well with the fully correlated curve for ˆα
7. In summary
we can say that the TDDFT result is in good agreement with the exact, fully correlated stabilization probability. Both
have their maximum around ˆα
4 and the “death valley” is also at the right position. For higher ˆα the agreement
seems to become even better.

C. “Inner sees outer” and “outer sees inner”-approximation

In order to explain non-sequential ionization (NSI; see, e.g., Ref. [1] for an overview) it is essential to incorporate
electron correlation (see [27] for a very recent paper, and references therein). For that purpose Watson et al. [21] added
a Hartree-type potential to the TDSE for the inner electron (see Eq. 6, ISO). By doing this the double ionization yield
is greatly enhanced, in accordance with experimental results [28]. The question we address in this Section is whether
this method is applicable to stabilization as well. We will also study the opposite procedure, i.e., where the outer

4

electron feels the inner one (see Eqs. 8 and 9, OSI). From the discussions on the SAE approximation above we can
expect that ISO will probably not agree very well with the exact results since the assumption that the outer electron
) behaves like SAE (the
sees a static, eﬀective nuclear charge is not valid. In Fig. 6 we see that, for low ˆα ISO (
△
o-curve) while OSI (✸) is similar to IE (the curve indicated by i
i
i). In ISO approximation for ˆα > 3 the electron
·
·
correlation obviously causes strong ionization, compared to the SAE result. Especially during the down-ramping,
when probability density of the outer electron moves from the turning points
ˆα back toward the nucleus, ionization
of the inner electron is enhanced. For ˆα > 4.5 the ISO curve even drops below the exact result (indicated by ‘corr’).
In OSI approximation the stabilization probability is also underestimated for ˆα > 4.5.
In summary we can say,
that for ˆα < 2, OSI is in very good agreement with the correct result while ISO is not, due to the inappropriate
assumption of the outer electron feeling just a static eﬀective nuclear charge. However, for higher ˆα ISO and OSI
tend to underestimate the stabilization probability while TDDFT does not (see Section III B and Fig. 5).

±

IV. INTERMEDIATE FREQUENCY RESULTS

In this Section we discuss the stabilization probability in the intermediate frequency regime

Ei where,
according a single active electron point-of-view, the outer electron should stabilize while for the inner one ionization is
more likely. In Fig. 7 we compare the result from the fully correlated calculation with those from the SAE treatment.
In SAE approximation, the outer electron is more stable than the inner one in the region 1.5 < ˆα < 8.5. For the
6, i.e., it is
inner electron no clear stabilization maximum is visible. For the outer electron the maximum is at ˆα
shifted toward higher ˆα compared to the high-frequency case. Both, i
i underestimates ionization, especially
o and i
·
·
for low ˆα in the “death valley”-region. Electron correlation obviously enhances ionization. For lower frequencies this
is the well-known eﬀect of NSI ( [27] and references therein). Although in the fully correlated result we observe a
stabilization probability maximum around ˆα
7.5 the absolute value is below 0.04, and, in our opinion, it makes no
sense to talk about real “stabilization” in that case. As in the high-frequency-case we observe an overall decrease of
the stabilization probability for very high ˆα-values.

Eo < ω <

≈

≈

In Fig. 8 we compare the result from the fully correlated model atom with the corresponding ones from the ISO,
OSI, and TDDFT runs where electron correlation is included approximately. Let us ﬁrst focus on the ˆα-region “left
1. There we observe that ISO is nearest to the correct result while OSI and TDDFT
from the death valley”, i.e., ˆα
underestimates ionization. This is quite understandable within the present knowledge of how NSI works: the inner
electron needs to interact with laser ﬁeld and the outer electron in order to become free. Obviously this is best
accounted for in the ISO approximation. For most ˆα TDDFT lies between the ISO and the OSI result. This is also
quite clear since in TDDFT both correlated electrons are treated on an equal footing (one Kohn-Sham-orbital only)
whereas in ISO (OSI) the inner (outer) electron feels the outer (inner) partner through Coulomb correlation, but not
vice verse. However, all these approximations still overestimate the stabilization probability, at least in the interesting
ˆα-regime where the stabilization probability rises at all (i.e., for 2 < ˆα < 7.5).

≤

To summarize this Section we can say that in order to achieve stabilization of our two-electron model atom it is
necessary to choose a laser frequency that exceeds all ionization potentials. For an intermediate frequency the outer
electron cannot stabilize owing to correlation. The SAE picture is not appropriate and even ISO, OSI, or TDDFT
where electron correlation is included approximately fail.

V. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

In this paper we studied how the electron correlation in a two-electron model atom aﬀects the probability for
stabilization. We found clear stabilization only for frequencies that exceed both ionization potentials. Although
for the intermediate frequency we did not ﬁnd a monotonous increase of the ionization probability with increasing
intensity we prefer not calling this eﬀect stabilization since, on an absolute scale, its probability was very small. In all
cases electron correlation reduced the stabilization probability compared to the SAE picture. In the high-frequency
case the two electrons behave more like two independent inner electrons. Similar results were obtained by Grobe and
Eberly [17] for a H− model-ion. Lewenstein et al. [18] performed classical calculations for a model-atom similar to
ours which also showed that “dichotomized” two-electron states are dynamically accessible.

The agreement of the exact numerical result with TDDFT in the high-frequency case was quite good while in
the intermediate frequency regime stabilization was overestimated by all approximate techniques (ISO, OSI, and
TDDFT).

It is well-known that a slow time-scale in the stabilization dynamics is introduced owing to ﬂoppings between states
in the time-averaged Kramers-Henneberger potential [4,9]. It can be easily imagined that these slow ﬂoppings are

5

aﬀected by electron correlation because, e.g., the merging of the two dichotomous peaks into a single one is suppressed
then. But even without correlation the results for the stabilization probability are quite sensitive to rise time and
pulse duration of the laser ﬁeld since it strongly depends on which Kramers-Henneberger states are mainly occupied
at the time instant when the laser pulse ends. To avoid these additional complications in the interpretation of the
numerical results we chose a rather short laser pulse duration so that low-frequency Rabi-ﬂoppings do not play a
role. Therefore, in the high-frequency studies we just observed the two dichotomous peaks building up (as depicted
in Fig. 4) but no peak-merging during the constant part of our trapezoidal laser pulse.

Finally, we would like to comment on the reduced dimensionality of our two-electron model atom. We also performed
calculations with “real”, i.e., three-dimensional (3D) hydrogen-like ions in the stabilization regime. It seems to be the
case that in 3D stabilization is less pronounced. Moreover, the oscillatory character is less visible, i.e., we observe a
single stabilization maximum followed by a rather monotonous increase of the ionization probability. The diﬀerence
of 1D models and 3D hydrogen was also studied in Ref. [24]. The eﬀect of electron correlation in 3D stabilization will
be the subject of a future paper [29].

dotted, dashed, and dashed-dotted, respectively) for the inner and the outer electron in “single active electron”-approximation.
The laser pulse of frequency ω = π was ramped-up linearly (in ﬁeld) over 5 cycles, held constant for another 5 cycles before
the linear down-ramp between t = 10 and t = 15 cyc. As expected, the outer electron is more stabilized. For the two higher
ˆα-values we clearly see that ionization is weak during the intense, constant part of the pulse.

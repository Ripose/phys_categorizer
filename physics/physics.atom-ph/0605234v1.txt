Abstract

We present a theoretical study of the spectra produced by optical/radio-frequency double res-

onance devices, in which resonant linearly polarized light is used in the optical pumping and

detection processes. We extend previous work by presenting algebraic results which are valid for

atomic states with arbitrary angular momenta, arbitrary rf intensities, and arbitrary geometries.

The only restriction made is the assumption of low light intensity. The results are discussed in

view of their use in optical magnetometers.

INTRODUCTION

Since the 1950s the combination of resonant optical excitation and magnetic resonance has

been an extremely valuable tool for atomic spectroscopy. This double resonance technique

[1] has not only proven useful for investigating atomic structure, for measuring properties of

atoms, their constituents, and their interactions, but has also led to important applications

in atom cooling, optically pumped frequency standards, and optical magnetometers.

Magnetometers based on double resonance in atomic samples measure the modulus of an

externally applied magnetic ﬁeld B0 via the Larmor precession frequency of the sample’s

magnetization in that ﬁeld [2, 3]. The sample is typically a vapor of paramagnetic atoms (or

diamagnetic atoms excited to a metastable state with an orbital angular momentum) sealed

in a glass cell. A macroscopic magnetization is created in the vapor by optical pumping with

polarized resonance radiation. The magnetization precesses in the magnetic ﬁeld B0 to be

measured (referred to as the oﬀset ﬁeld) and that precession is driven by a (much weaker)

magnetic ﬁeld B1(t) (referred to as the rf ﬁeld), co-rotating with the magnetization around

the oﬀset ﬁeld.

Since the optical properties of the medium, characterized by its complex index of re-

fraction, depend on its spin polarization, the driven magnetization will induce periodic

modulations of those properties [4, 5], which are then detected. In most applications, the

same light beam used to polarize the medium is also used to monitor the oscillations by mea-

suring either the power or the polarization state of the transmitted beam. The frequency of

the induced oscillations coincides with the oscillation frequency ω of the rf ﬁeld, and their

amplitude depends in a resonant way on the detuning between ω and the Larmor frequency
ω0 = γF B0 associated with the oﬀset ﬁeld. The Land´e factor γF = gF µB/~ is characteristic

for the pumped atomic state with total angular momentum F .

Most practical double resonance devices rely on atomic orientation prepared by optical

pumping with circularly polarized light. In this paper we present a theoretical study of the

resonance signals obtained in double resonance spectroscopy using linearly polarized light.

As shown ﬁrst by Bell and Bloom [6] magnetic resonance in aligned media leads to signal

modulations at the fundamental and at the second harmonic of the rf frequency. We derive

algebraic expressions for the spectral line shapes of the in-phase and quadrature components

of both signals and their orientation dependence. Previous theoretical treatments of such

2

signals [7, 8] were restricted to speciﬁc angular momentum states (J = 1) or to low rf powers.

The results presented here are more general in the sense that they apply to arbitrary spin

systems and that they are valid for arbitrary rf power levels and for arbitrary orientations

of B0 with respect to the light polarization.

II. POLARIZED ATOMIC MEDIA

A. Atomic Multipole Moments

be expressed in terms of atomic multipole moments mk,q according to [9]

(cid:11)
The three multipole moments mk=1,q=−1,0,+1 represent the orientation of the medium, while

(cid:10)

the ﬁve components mk=2,q=−2,...,+2 represent its alignment. The multipole moments mk,q=0

are called longitudinal multipole moments and their value depends only on sublevel popula-

tions. The multipole moments mk,q6=0 represent sublevel coherences and are called transverse

moments. The representation of the atomic polarization in terms of multipole moments has

a signiﬁcant advantage over a representation in terms of sublevel populations and coher-

ences.

In principle, both representations require the same number of parameters for the

complete description of the atomic ensemble. However, because electric dipole radiation

couples only [10] to orientation (k = 1) and alignment (k = 2) it is suﬃcient to specify the

corresponding 3 + 5 = 8 multipole moments for the complete description of the system’s

optical properties. Moreover, speciﬁc light polarizations couple only to speciﬁc subsets of

3

these 8 multipole moments, so that the use of the tensor formalism in systems with large

angular momenta leads to a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation of the mathematical treatment. In the

case discussed here only the (real) multipole moment m2,0 will be relevant. This approach

therefore allows one to derive results valid for systems with arbitrary angular momenta.

A resonant circularly polarized laser beam interacting with an unpolarized atomic sample

will create orientation (k = 1, vector polarization) and alignment (k = 2, tensor polarization)

in the sample by optical pumping. The lowest order multipole that a linearly polarized

light ﬁeld can create is an atomic alignment. While only atomic states with J

1/2 can

≥

be oriented, the condition J

1 has to be fulﬁlled for the creation of an aligned state.

≥

Note that an alignment along the direction of light propagation can also be produced by

pumping with unpolarized light [6, 11]. The ground state of alkali atoms has an electronic

angular momentum J = 1/2, which cannot be aligned. However, the hyperﬁne interaction

with the nuclear spin splits the ground state into two hyperﬁne levels with total angular

momenta F± = I

J, which can be aligned provided F

1. An alignment can therefore

±

≥

be prepared and/or detected only if the light source has a suﬃcient spectral resolution to

excite a single hyperﬁne transition. In general the Doppler (and pressure) broadened spectra

of discharge lamps, used in conventional optically pumped magnetometers (OPM), cannot

be used to address individual hyperﬁne lines and hence do not allow one to create nor to

detect a ground state alignment. However, radiation from a narrowband laser can resolve

the hyperﬁne structure and it is well known that a linearly polarized laser beam can create

an atomic alignment.

B. DROMs and DRAMs

We will refer to an OPM based on atomic orientation as DROM (double resonance ori-

entation magnetometer), while we will speak of DRAM (double resonance alignment mag-

netometer) when the magnetization has the symmetry of an atomic alignment. Most of the

past research work on double resonance spectroscopy dealt with oriented vapors, although

alignment induced by (unpolarized) lamp pumping in J = 1 metastable states of 4He was

already reported in 1960/61 [6, 11]. In alkali atoms, alignment produced by lamp pumping

can be observed using line splitting by the quadratic Zeeman eﬀect [12] or isotope ﬁltering

[5, 12]. The latter technique is, however, restricted to Rb and cannot be applied to other

alkalis. As mentioned above, linearly polarized laser radiation is an eﬃcient means for pro-

ducing alignment and a discussion of linearly polarized laser pumping in metastable 4He can

be found in [7, 13]. These authors have investigated several magnetometry techniques using

both orientation and alignment signals and they observed magnetic resonances involving

alignment using rf ﬁelds, light intensity modulation, polarization modulation, and frequency

modulation. A variant of the latter technique – in which the transmitted lights’ polarization,

instead of intensity, was measured – was realized with 87Rb [14, 15].

III. DRAM GEOMETRY

We will restrict the discussion to geometries in which the rf ﬁeld B1 is perpendicular to the

oﬀset ﬁeld B0. With this condition, the possible geometries of a double resonance experiment

with linearly polarized light can be described in terms of two angular parameters, viz., θ,

the angle between

B0 and the propagation direction

between the light polarization

IV. MODEL CALCULATIONS

In Fig. 2 we have applied the rotating wave approximation by decomposing the rf ﬁeld

into two counter-rotating ﬁelds, from which we have retained only the component co-rotating

with the alignment. This component is shown in its position at time t = 0, thereby deﬁning

the time origin of the phases of the oscillating signal components. The magnetometer signals

are calculated following a 3-step (prepare, evolve, probe) approach [16].

A. Step 1: Creation of alignment by optical pumping

For the description of the pumping process we chose a coordinate frame in which the

quantization axis lies along the light polarization (lab frame in Fig. 2). For symmetry

reasons, the only non-vanishing alignment component created by the optical pumping process

is the longitudinal multipole moment

In the presence of an oﬀset ﬁeld B0 the alignment components perpendicular to B0 will

for the alignment along the magnetic ﬁeld, given by the projection of mini

tion. Note that this steady state is reached only when the Larmor frequency is much larger

than the transverse relaxation rates. This condition is well fulﬁlled for high-Q magnetic

6

resonances while it is not met by zero-ﬁeld level-crossing resonances (ground state Hanle

eﬀect, nonlinear Faraday eﬀect[16]).

B. Step 2: Magnetic resonance

This step describes the magnetic resonance process, i.e., the evolution of the alignment

under the combined actions of the magnetic ﬁelds B0, B1, and relaxation processes. It is

described in a coordinate frame, which is related to the lab frame by a static rotation of

γ around the y-axis and then by a dynamic rotation, at the frequency ω, around the new

−
z-axis. In this frame, which we call the rotating wave frame (rw frame), the oﬀset ﬁeld B0

is along z, while the rf ﬁeld B1 appears to be static and oriented at an angle α with respect

to the x-direction (see Fig 2). This is the usual ﬁeld conﬁguration for describing magnetic
resonance processes. Note that meq

2,0 is not aﬀected by the transformation to the rw frame.

Due to the rotation of the coordinate frame, a ﬁctitious magnetic ﬁeld Bf =

ment components m2,q6=0 relax towards a zero value, while the longitudinal component m2,0
relaxes towards meq

2,0, introduced in step 1. Below, we present very general results for the

case when all three relaxation rates are diﬀerent, although it is well known that there are

speciﬁc relations between those rates when the relaxation mechanism has speciﬁc rotational

symmetries [17]. Eqations 6 are a generalization of the well known Bloch equations

We have used a computer algebra software to determine algebraic expressions for the

steady state (d/dt m2,q = 0) solutions m2,q of (6). These solutions are then transformed

back to the lab frame, by ﬁrst applying a dynamic rotation at the rate

ω around the

−

z-axis, and then a static rotation by γ around the y-axis of the rw frame. In this way one

can derive algebraic expressions for the time dependent multipole moments m2,q(t) in the

lab frame.

C. Step 3: Detection of the oscillating steady state alignment

In the third and ﬁnal step, we calculate the eﬀect the time dependent multipole moments

have on the optical absorption coeﬃcient of the medium. One can show that the absorption

coeﬃcient of a medium described by mk,q for linearly polarized light is proportional to

. We assume the optical

transition to be closed and the light intensity to be so weak that excited state populations

remain negligible, so that the monopole moment does not depend on time. The only time

dependent (oscillating) component of the absorption coeﬃcient is therefore proportional

to m2,0(t). We deﬁne the time dependent DRAM signal, normalized to the longitudinal

alignment initially produced by the optical pumping, as

(10)

D. Validity of the three step approach

The three step approach is only valid if steady state conditions are reached in steps 1

and 2. This is fulﬁlled when the pump rate Γp, at which alignment components are modiﬁed

by the interaction with the light is negligible compared to the relaxation rates Γ|q|. This

condition can be realized experimentally at low light powers, however, at the cost of a

decreased signal to noise ratio. OPMs are known to perform best when Γp is comparable to

Γ|q|. The lowest order correction, taking the depolarization of light interactions into account,

can be described by

where PL is the laser power.

Γ|q| →

Γ|q| + Γp = Γ|q| + ηPL ,

(11)

It is well known that substitution (11) is valid to all orders in PL for a DROM in a spin

1/2 system [18], in which orientation is the only multipole moment that can be created.

It is reasonable to assume that the same statement can be made for a DRAM in a spin

1 system in which alignment is the only multipole moment created and detected by the

linearly polarized light. For angular momenta F > 1 the creation of higher order (k > 2)

multipole moments and their transfer back to (detectable) k = 2 moments limits the validity

of substitution (11) to low light powers.

V. RESULTS

The calculation outlined above yields signals Sω(t) and S2ω(t) which are modulated at

the rf frequency ω and at its second harmonic 2ω, and which can be written as

where the angular dependence of the signals is given by hω(γ) and h2ω(γ). As stated earlier

the orientation angle α of the rf ﬁeld appears as a phase shift. The in-phase and quadrature

components of the signal have both absorptive (Aω, A2ω) and dispersive (Dω, D2ω) lineshapes

and D2ω change with increasing rf intensity. A narrow additional spectral feature appears

in the ﬁrst harmonic signal for Srf > 0.5. The origin of this structure can be explained

as follows: the basic interaction of the rf ﬁeld with the angular momentum is the coupling

of adjacent Zeeman sublevels. The corresponding ∆M =

1 coherences oscillate at the rf

±

frequency ω and their detection by the light ﬁeld constitutes the ﬁrst harmonic signal. With

increasing rf power, a further interaction of a ∆M = 1 coherence with the rf ﬁeld B1 becomes

possible and leads to the creation of a ∆M = 2 coherence, whose oscillation produces the

second harmonic signal. An additional interaction of the ∆M = 2 coherence with the rf

ﬁeld produces both ∆M = 3 and ∆M = 1 coherences. While the former cannot be detected

optically since linearly polarized light couples at most to ∆M = 2 coherences, the latter

directly contributs to the ﬁrst harmonic signal. In this sense, the additional features can

be understood as resulting from the creation of a ∆M = 2 coherence by a second order

interaction with the rf ﬁeld, the evolution of that coherence in the oﬀset ﬁeld, and back-

transfer to a ∆M = 1 coherence by an additional interaction with the rf ﬁeld followed by

detection of that coherence at the ﬁrst harmonic frequency ω.

The additional narrow feature in the absorptive signal that appears at large rf intensities

was already observed in the pioneering work by Colegrove and Franken on optically induced

alignment [11]. Based on the results presented above the feature can be explained in terms

i.e., as a superposition of two absorptive Lorentzian line shapes whose widths, for Srf →
diﬀer by a factor of 2, while they become equal for large values of Srf. The appearance of

0,

the central dip is a consequence of the diﬀerent rates at which the contributions saturate

with increasing Srf. At low rf powers, the amplitudes of the two contributions to the ﬁrst
ω1 and S3/2
harmonic signals (20) grow as S1/2

1 respectively, which reﬂects that
these resonances correspond to ﬁrst and third order processes as discussed above. The

rf ∝

rf ∝

ω3

second harmonic signals (Eqs. 19a, 19b), on the other hand, grow as ω2

1, which reﬂects their

second order nature.

C. Amplitudes of absorptive and widths of dispersive signals

Let us next consider the amplitudes of the absorptive signals Aω and A2ω given by Eqs. 15b

and 15d. On resonance, the signal amplitudes are given by

Aω(x = 0) =

A2ω(x = 0) =

√Srf
1 + 4Srf
Srf
1 + 4Srf

.

These dependencies are shown on the left in Fig. 6. The second harmonic signal amplitude
saturates, for Srf → ∞
maximum Amax

2ω = 0.25, while the ﬁrst harmonic signal reaches a

, at a value of Amax

ω = 0.25 at Srf = 0.25 and vanishes for Srf → ∞

.

The dependence of the line widths, i.e., the frequency separation ∆ωFW of the maxima

and minima of the dispersive signals Dω and D2ω on Srf can be inferred from the derivatives

of (15a) and (15c). Although an algebraic expression can be derived for the width of the

ﬁrst harmonic dispersive signal Dω, this expression is too complex to be displayed here. We

quote only the expression for the rf power broadening of the width of the second harmonic

dispersive signal D2ω, i.e.,

The dispersive line shape of the second harmonic signal D2ω is thus 2.6 times narrower than

VI. THE PHASE OF THE SIGNALS

We deﬁne the phases ϕω (ϕ2ω) of the ﬁrst and second harmonic signals as the phase

diﬀerence between Sω(t) (S2ω(t)) and oscillations that are proportional to cos ωt (cos 2ωt)

respectively. This deﬁnition is motivated by the fact that the rf ﬁeld in the lab frame is

proportional to cos ωt. As an alternative to the parametrization of the signals in terms of

in-phase and quadrature components (Eq. 12) one can write Sω(t) and S2ω(t) in terms of

moduli Rω, R2ω and phases ϕω, ϕ2ω according to

Sω = hω(γ)Rω(x, Srf) cos [ωt + ϕω(x, Srf)] ,

S2ω = h2ω(γ)R2ω(x, Srf) cos [2ωt + ϕ2ω(x, Srf)] ,

A dual-phase lock-in ampliﬁer can be used to extract the R’s and ϕ’s from the signal.

Such ampliﬁers usually allow one to apply an oﬀset phase ϕos to the signal which then adds

to α. For stabilization purposes, it is practical to choose that oﬀset phase such that the

total phase vanishes at the center of the resonance ϕω(x = 0) = ϕ2ω(x = 0) = 0. This choice

avoids phase discontinuities and provides a signal ϕ(x)

x (for x

1) that is proportional

∝

to magnetic ﬁeld changes near the center of the resonance. In the parametrization deﬁned

above this can be realized simultaneously for both signals when α + ϕos = π/2. In that case

Examples of ϕω(x) and ϕ2ω(x) for diﬀerent values of Srf are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 respec-

The phase of the ﬁrst harmonic signal ϕω (Eq. 25a) for low rf power (Srf ≪

1/2) is

identical to the phase of an orientation based magnetic resonance signal (DROM see Sec.

IX). Conversely to that DROM phase (34b), which does not depend on Srf, the DRAM

phases ϕω and ϕ2ω depend on Srf, and ϕω even changes the sign of its slope at Srf = 1/2.

Note that ϕ2ω makes a total phase swing of 2π across the resonance, while ϕω swings only

VII. PARAMETRIZATION IN θ, φ GEOMETRY

A parametrization of the magnetometer signals in terms of the azimuthal and polar angles

θ and φ of Fig. 1 is useful for practical applications in which one may want to rotate the

16

plane of polarization, i.e., change φ only. Using the procedure outlined in section IV one

can show that the signals are then given by

where the line shape functions Aω, A2ω, Dω, and D2ω correspond to the expressions given

by Eq. (15). The phase angle β is given by

while the angular dependencies of the ﬁrst and second harmonic signals are given by

Sω(t) = gω(θ, φ) [ Aω(x, Srf) cos (ωt

VIII. MAGNETOMETRY CONSIDERATIONS

There are two modes of OPM operation, the self-oscillating mode and the free running

mode, which diﬀer in the way the magnetic ﬁeld value is extracted from the signals described

above. Self-oscillating (or phase stabilized) magnetometers use feedback to keep the driving

frequency ω equal to ω0, and in such magnetometers, ω is measured with a frequency counter

[19]. We will not discuss the self-oscillating mode in detail since the feedback is diﬃcult to

describe analytically. Instead, we discuss the free-running mode which yields an identical

magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity. The goal of the following discussion is not the derivation of

absolute ﬁeld sensitivities, but rather a comparison of the relative magnetometric sensitivities

that one can expect from the ﬁrst and second harmonic signals.

FIG. 7: Slopes sω,2ω of the dispersive signals on resonance (x = 0) as a function of the rf saturation

parameter for two diﬀerent ranges of Srf.

As a free-running magnetometer application we consider the recording of signal changes

induced by variations of the oﬀset ﬁeld B0 while the rf frequency ω is kept constant. Ei-

ther the dispersive signals Dω and D2ω (Eqs. 15a ,15c) or the phase signals ϕω and ϕ2ω

(Eqs. 25a ,25b) can be used as discriminating signals as they both feature a linear depen-

dence on B0 changes near the center of the resonance (x = 0).

The resolution with which ﬁeld changes can be detected is limited by noise processes such

as photon shotnoise, electron shotnoise (in a photodiode), and spin projection noise, all of

which have white a noise spectrum. We specify the magnetometric sensitivity in terms of

the noise equivalent magnetic ﬁeld (NEM) [20, 21], which is the amplitude ∆BNEM of ﬁeld

ﬂuctuations which induce ﬂuctuations of the (dispersive) signal S(B0) that are equal to the

signal noise ∆S:

∆BNEM = ∆S (dS/dB0|x=0)−1
One can show that for a given noise level of the modulated signal one obtains the same

NEM either from the demodulated signal S = Dω(D2ω) or from the demodulated signal S =
ϕω(ϕ2ω). The minimal value of ∆BNEM is thus obtained under conditions which maximize

is thus expected to yield a 1.8 times higher sensitivity to magnetic ﬁeld changes than the

ﬁrst harmonic signal.

IX. DROM SIGNALS

Although detailed line shapes for magnetometers based on circularly polarized radiation

have been discussed in detail in the literature [3] we quote the corresponding expressions

here for completeness. We discuss again only geometries in which B1 is perpendicular to B0,

described by a single angular variable θ (Fig. 8). Optical pumping with circularly polarized

light creates a longitudinal orientation mini

The oscillating orientation components m1,q are obtained by solving the Bloch equations (8)

X. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have presented a general theoretical framework for the calculation of optical rf double

resonance signals that can be easily applied to oriented or aligned atomic media. The theory

yields analytical results with a broad range of validity, and is only limited by the assumption

of low light power.

DRAMs, i.e., magnetometers that use linearly polarized light, present several potential

advantages over the well known DROM scheme:

Line widths: The line shapes of the second harmonic DRAM signal have signiﬁ-

•

cantly narrower linewidths than the DROM signal under identical conditions. Narrow

20

linewidths potentially increase the magnetometric sensitivity and suppress systematic

errors in optical magnetometers due to long term baseline drifts [22].

Light shift: In DROM devices the interaction of the atoms with the circularly polarized

laser light leads to M dependent energy shifts (vector light shift) of the sublevels

F, M

when the laser frequency is not centered on the optical resonance line. In that

|
case, power and frequency ﬂuctuations of the laser mimic magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations,

i

thereby limiting the magnetometric performance. In the DRAM device the linearly

polarized light produces a tensor light shift [23] depending on M 2, which does not

have the characteristics of the Zeeman interaction and will therefore not aﬀect the

magnetometric performance.

Geometry: The DROM scheme achieves a maximal sensitivity for θ = π/4 (Eq. 33).

The 45◦ angle that the laser beam has to make with the magnetic ﬁeld seriously limits

applications which call for a compact arrangement of multiple sensors.

In multi-

channel devices, as required, e.g., for cardiomagnetic measurements [24], the use of

the DRAM signals oﬀers the advantage that the laser beam can be oriented either

parallel or perpendicular to the oﬀset ﬁeld.

Vector magnetometry: Both the DROM and the DRAM devices are scalar magne-

tometers and their resonance frequency measures

. However, the DRAM signals

can be used to realize a vector magnetometer, since the ratio of R2ω/Rω is proportional

to tan γ, for all values of Srf. The knowledge of

and γ locates

B0 on a cone and

the variation of the signal with φ, obtained by rotating the polarizer, will determine

b

the polar angle of

B0 on the cone. In this way the DRAM scheme can be used to infer

B0|

|

B0

|

|

all three vector components of the ﬁeld.
b

Relaxation: We are in the process of performing extensive experimental studies of the

DRAM properties in paraﬃne coated cesium cells [25]. First results indicate that a

description of the signals using three independent relaxation rates (Eqs. 13) is required

to describe the experimental lineshapes in detail. The DRAM signals thus seem to

oﬀer a convenient way for studying spin relaxation processes in aligned media.

Signal noise: Diode lasers are convenient light sources for double resonance experi-

ments. However, they often feature a 1/f (ﬂicker) intensity noise at low frequencies

•

•

•

•

•

21

that turns into the white shot noise level at higher frequencies. The detection of D2ω

and A2ω at twice the Larmor frequency makes it easier to operate in a region where

the laser noise is less aﬀected by ﬂicker noise.

Cs OPMs in the DROM geometry have a shot noise limited sensitivity of 10 fT/Hz1/2

[21]. A direct experimental comparison of DRAM and DROM magnetometers is currently

underway in our laboratory. This study will show if the potential adventages can be realized

in practice.

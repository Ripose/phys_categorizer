In this paper we have applied the luster-expansion ansatz for the wave operator

whih in-

Ω

orporates the orbital relaxation and orrelation e(cid:27)ets in an e(cid:30)ient manner. We have used both

ordinary and normal ordered luster operator (

) to ompute the ionization potential for di(cid:27)erent

states of Ne, Ar, and Kr. The result in our alulation learly shows how the relaxation and orre-

lation e(cid:27)ets play the role in determining the ionization potential, one of the interesting aspets in

theoretial spetrosopy.

1 Introdution

In spetrosopi studies ionization potential (IP), eletron a(cid:30)nity (EA), exitation energy (EE) and

double IP (DIP) are important in many aspets. For example, in all kind of eletron spetrosopy,

inluding photo-eletron and Auger the IP, DIPs always play ma jor roles. Speially, the knowledge

of ore IP provides insights into the hoie and tunability of the ionizing beam in all kinds of eletron

sattering experiments like e − 2e, e − 3e, γ − 2e, double Auger deay et. These experiments are not only

important to understand the physis but also to the development of new (cid:28)elds like quantum omputing

thorough the idea of entanglement involved in the proess. Hene aurate theoretial determination

of IP for ore as well as valane eletrons may give some impetus to the physis underlying in those

experiments.

Open-shell Coupled Cluster (OSCC) method is used sine several years to ompute the IP, EA [1, 2,

3℄ and DIPs [1, 4℄ - usually employing omplete model spae (CMS) [5, 6℄. In the last deade oupled

luster (CC) methods have been generalized to handle the inomplete model spae (IMS) [2,4,7,8℄ in a

size-extensive manner. In this paper we have tried to demonstrate the results arising from the algebrai

struture of the expansion of the wave operator Ω = exp(T + S). We have used both the ordinary
and normal ordered luster expansion of the wave operator Ω. Normally the operator T orresponds to

ore-orrelation.

Lindgren [9℄ has shown how the normal ordered luster expansion of the wave operator Ω an inlude

the orrelation e(cid:27)ets. Here we will show in a sophistiated way how the relaxation e(cid:27)ets, the many-

body e(cid:27)et of di(cid:27)erent kind an also be taken into aount in the alulation of ionization potential

within the algebrai struture of the semi-normal ordered luster expansion of the wave operator Ω.

The form of the luster expansion takes are the relaxation e(cid:27)et in a ompat and e(cid:30)ient manner

and it an be easily demonstrated how the oupling of di(cid:27)erent many body e(cid:27)ets like relaxation and

orrelation e(cid:27)ets ome into the piture automatially. In an earlier publiations Chaudhuri et. al. [10℄

have explored this tehniques and applied to moleules.

In this paper we have alulated ionization potentials (IPs) of di(cid:27)erent states of Ne, Ar and Kr. IPs are

alulated for ore and valane orbitals of those lose shell atoms using two di(cid:27)erent approahes. Setion

2 deals with the theoretial formulation of the two di(cid:27)erent methods of alulation using the exp(S)
and {exp(S)} theories respetively, where {· · ·} denotes normal ordering. Setion 3 presents the results

obtained from our alulation and a detail disussion about the physial aspets of the two theories. In

setion 4 we have made the onluding remarks and the important (cid:28)ndings of our alulations.

2 Theory

It is a well established fat that the orbital relaxation e(cid:27)ets are more important than the orrelation

e(cid:27)ets in the ore hole ionization (CHI) proess. Sine in CHI the relaxation e(cid:27)ets are stronger than

the orrelation e(cid:27)ets, perturbative treatment will not be a e(cid:30)ient one beause in higher orders it will

be very umbersome and that is the reason to hoose the non-perturbative approah like CC.

Let us start from the N -eletron Dira Fok (DF) determinant |Φ0i. The (N −1) ionized determinants
|Φαi are obtained from the DF referene state where one eletron is ionized from the orbital α. Here the
labels α, β . . . denote holes and p, q . . . denote partiles. The optimized unnormalized (N − 1)-eletron

determinant, involving energy optimized orbitals an be written as

(1)

(3)

where

paγ.

The amplitudes hp| sα |γi an be uniquely determined and may be used to indue orbital relaxation
e(cid:27)ets. Like Eq.(1), |Ψi, the ombination of the determinantal states |Φαi also transforms in a similar

way and we have the new funtion having modi(cid:28)ed determinant with the assoiated modi(cid:28)ed orbital set

for wah determinant. We write it as

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
where Cα 's are the oe(cid:30)ients of |Ψi.

To alulate the energy di(cid:27)erene diretly we have to hoose the determinantal state |Φ0i as our

referene state for both the neutral and ionized states. In that ase we have to de(cid:28)ne a new Fok-spae

representation sine Eq.(3) involves only determinantal states not the true Fok-spae operator. To do

it, we (cid:28)rst hoose a two body operator and replae Sα
Sα = Sα

where {· · ·} denotes normal ordering with respet to |Φ0i. Due to the normal ordering, Sα
|Φαi will give zero unless the determinantal state has a hole in α. Figure (1a) and (1b) represent the
Hugenholtz diagrams orresponding to the two terms Sα

It has been shown [9℄ that the normal ordered expansion of S redues to

The higher orders of S will not survive beause S ontains the hole reation operator and self ontration
in S is not allowed. Now let us onsider other form of the S operator, denoted as exp(S) :

3 Results and disussions

The results obtained by our alulation of IPs of Ne, Ar and Kr using two di(cid:27)erent approahes are

presented in table 1. Figure 3, 4 and 5 shows the relative error in IP for di(cid:27)erent states of Ne, Ar and

Kr respetively. From table 1 and (cid:28)gures 3, 4 and 5 it is lear that the agreement of IPs obtained by the

exp(S) theory is better than {exp(S)} theory for the ore states. This nature an be interpreted in terms

of the di(cid:27)erent many-body e(cid:27)ets, namely relaxation and orrelation e(cid:27)ets. For deep lying ores, the

relaxation e(cid:27)ets are stronger than the orrelation e(cid:27)ets, whih is taken are of by the exp(S) theory as
ompared to the {exp(S)} theory (Fig.1, 2). Where as for high-lying ore orbitals the relaxation e(cid:27)ets
are omparatively less than the deep ore orbitals like 1s1/2 and 2s1/2 . And thus the results obtained by
the {exp(S)} theory performs better than the exp(S) theory for high lying states like 3p and 4p. These

an be interpreted in a better way if we look at the Thouless's treatment [11℄. When the relaxation is very

strong, a perturbative treatment is very umbersome in higher orders and also ine(cid:30)ient. The widely

used normal ordered luster expansion approah is not ompat enough to inlude the relaxation e(cid:27)ets

Figure 2: Diagrammati representation of the luster operator S

in an adequate manner in the theories to alulate IP, EA, EE and DIP. To overome this problem we

have explored the generalized Thouless's treatment and have alulated the results by using the exp(S)

theory.

In table 1 the results in the parentheses are obtained from UCC(3) and it is lear that for these kind

of problem the introdution of the unitary exitation operator does not improve the results muh. The

details and the results using UCC(3) [14℄ will be ommuniated shortly.

If we minutely observe the results for Kr we an see that the relaxation and orrelation e(cid:27)ets are

anelled out for almost all the states. In other words, these two e(cid:27)ets are ompensated by eah other.

This beomes more lear if we see the Koopman's energy for this system given in table 1.

Besides the experimental values, IPs from δ -SCF are also listed in table 1. The δ -SCF IPs are

omputed using GRASP programme [15℄. In this proedure, the eletron binding energy orresponds to

the αth orbital is obtained from

IP (α) = E(N ) − Eα(N − 1),

(10)

where E(N ) and Eα(N − 1) are the SCF energies of N and (N − 1)-eletron systems respetively. The
present alulation shows that δ -SCF estimates the ore IP more aurately than the valene IP. This

is in aordane with our expetation. Note that the di(cid:27)erential eletron orrelation whih is important

for valene IP an not be inorporated through δ -SCF proedure. Sine the orbital relaxation e(cid:27)et an
be introdued through δ -SCF proedure, this yield reasonably aurate ore IPs.

4 Conluding remarks

In this paper we have presented the alulation of ionization potentials for ore and valane orbitals of

some rare gas atoms, namely Ne, Ar and Kr. We have explored both the exp(S) and {exp(S)} theory

to obtain the results. Along with the normal luster expansion ansatz we have also obtained the results

by using unitary luster operator theory (UCC) for both the formalisms.

The lose omparison between the results obtained by the two di(cid:27)erent approahes are explored

and disussed in details. The (cid:28)gures ontaining the omputational errors for di(cid:27)erent theories help us

to understand the trends of the obtained results. This alulation learly demonstrate the importane

of di(cid:27)erent many-body e(cid:27)ets, namely di(cid:27)erential eletron orrelation and orbital relaxation e(cid:27)ets in

determining ionization potential of losed shell atoms.

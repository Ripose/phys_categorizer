It is shown that a two-level atom, being initially in general superposition state of ground and
excited energy levels with mutually diﬀerent momentum distributions there, gets a large scale evo-
lution in the energy levels momentum distribution. As a consequence the mean momentum of each
individual energy level also gets large scale changes, more than the own momentum ¯hk of the pho-
ton1. Thoroughly is discussed the special case, when the atom’s preliminary superposition state is
created as a result of interaction of the atom with the resonant standing wave. Also it is pointed
that in such conditions the mentioned phenomenon can be presented as a transformation of the
resonant Kapitza-Dirac splitting of atomic states into the Stern-Gerlach type splitting.

I. INTRODUCTION

Interaction of a two - level system with a plane traveling wave leads to one-photon transitions between energy levels
and consequent changes of total atomic momentum in limits of one photon momentum ¯hk. What can be said about
distributions and mean values of momentum for each individual atomic level? The answer is well-known and is trivial,
if the atom before the interaction is on one of the energy levels: distribution on the other level sets shift ¯hk and
mean values of momentum distinguished also by ¯hk; pe = pg + ¯hk, where pg and pe are mean values of momentum
on ground and excited levels consequently (1D case).What would we have in general case, that is, when the atom
before the interaction with the travelling wave is in the superposition state of ground and excited levels with mutually
diﬀerent momentum distributions there? In the following just this question will be elucidated in details: in general
form in Sec. 2, and the special case of preparing standing wave, latter.

In Sec. 2 it will be shown that in one-photon absorption/emission process, in general, large scale redistributions
of the energy level’s momenta takes place. This entails the time-changes of the pg, pe and these changes can greatly
exceed the value of one photon momentum. In general, the relations pe = pg + ¯hk are not true, too.

In Sec. 3 we will discuss from the practical point of view a very important case, when the preliminary superposition
state of the atom is realized by the coherent diﬀraction of the atom in the ﬁeld of resonant standing wave, which is
being often referred to us the resonant Kapitza-Dirac eﬀect. Will be pointed out, that the redistribution of momenta
in the travelling can be received as a transition from the resonant Kapitza-Dirac splitting to the Stern-Gerlach type
splitting. In Sec. 4 will be discussed the temporal behavior of the energy level’s mean momenta. The results are
summarized in Sec. 5, where the possibility of experimental observation of this phenomenon will be sketched too.

II. DISTRIBUTIONS AND MEAN VALUES OF MOMENTUM ON THE GROUND AND EXCITED
ENERGY LEVELS IN THE ABSORPTION/EMISSION OF ONE PHOTON

Let’s discuss the resonant interaction of a two-level atom with the radiation ﬁeld [1]. For the sake of simplicity,
suppose the ﬁeld has plane wavefront, linear polarization (these assumptions will be conserved for the standing
wave, discussed in Sec.3), turns on instantly and after on it’s amplitude remains constant. Let the wave functions
of free two-level atom’s ground (g) and excited (e) levels be ϕg(−→ρ , t) and ϕe(−→ρ , t) respectively, where−→ρ is atomic
internal coordinate (radius-vector of the optical electron relative to the atomic center-of-mass). The wave function of
interacting atom will be [1]

1Because of not completeness of the literature under the hand, we are not sure that this simple phenomenon isn’t known in
quantum theory of atom-photon interactions or, particularly, in the interferometry of atomic matter waves. One of main pur-
poses of this article is our request to the leading specialists to respond and if the phenomenon is known, send the corresponding
references.

where A and B are the probability amplitudes of the atom to be on the ground and excited levels correspondingly.

When taking into account translational motion of the atomic center of mass, it is necessary to separate respective
parts (wave functions) in A and B coeﬃcients. If, for example, the atom on thw energy level has the well-deﬁned
value of momentum p, the respective wave function is given by function

Ψ = A ϕg(−→ρ , t) + B ϕe(−→ρ , t)

that is, by the exponential function with imaginarily degree. In general, when on energy levels an atom hasn’t deﬁnite
values of momentum, A and B coeﬃcients will be expressed by the series of χ(p)-states:

A(t, z) =

a(p, t)χ(p)dp, B(t, z) =

with probability amplitudes a(p, t) and b(p, t) of atom to have momentum p (at the t moment of time), simultaneously

that is the contribution of momentum per energy level evolves periodically and this is the evolution merely caused

periodic evolutions in the form of momentum distributions there. Herewith the atomic amplitudes a(p, t) and b(p, t)
aren’t mutually proportional (with any constant shift).

To wash out the contributions, appropriate to evolution of the energy level populations, let introduce a pair of new

quantities, pg and pe, which would be scaled in units of level-populations ng and ne respectively:

Since these new quantities are already independent on level populations, their possible evolutions would be stipulated
by form-deformations in the energy levels momentum distributions. Afterwards we will call them mean momenta of
ground energy level (pg) and of excited energy level (pe) correspondingly.. Thereby the total momentum of atom, in
addition to (5), can be presented in the following more convenient form:

These mean momenta, pg and pe, remain constant, of course, if the atom is initially on one of the energy levels. They
remain constant also when the initial distributions are mutually proportional with constant shift ¯hk:

In the general case, nevertheless, the evolution of state is due to interference of non-similarly distributed amplitudes,
the atomic amplitudes distributions on energy levels aren’t proportional with each other yet and, as a consequence,
mean momenta pe and pg get temporal evolution, too.

For acquisition of more concrete and quantitative results, let’s note that for the intentions of atom optics and
interferometry [2] the coherent scattering of atoms in the resonant ﬁeld of standing wave is the routine for preparation
of large spreaded momentum distribution. The probability amplitudes, prepared in a such way, can’t satisfy the
<<undesirable>>condition (21) in principle, since in the ﬁeld of standing wave . as is well known, any state with
momentum p on one energy level is connected with the two-states on other energy level with momenta p
¯hk and
p + ¯hk simultaneously. Therefore, any atom prepared by means of resonant Kapitza-Dirac eﬀect, during its later
interaction with the travelling wave, ought to implicitly change the momentum distributions on energy levels with
following to it above mentioned consequences.

III. PREPARATION OF SUPERPOSITIONAL STATES ON ATOMIC GROUND AND EXCITED
LEVELS BY MEANS OF SCATTERING IN THE FIELD OF RESONANT STANDING WAVE

Let before the interaction with the travelling wave, during time τs, the atom had coherent interaction with the
resonant (ω = ω0) standing wave [3]. We restrict ourselves to the relatively simple case, when the interaction
proceeds by the well known scheme of mutually orthogonal atom-standing wave beams. Moreover, the Raman-Nath
approximation will be employed, which permit to put out from the problem at hand the kinetic energy term in
the Hamiltonian (note that the kinetic energy term has not been included into (12) too). Although the scheme of
calculation is well known and presented in details (see, for example, in [2], [3], we ﬁnd it convenient to give an account
of main intermediate formulas, too.

To describe the interaction in the preparing standing wave, the electric ﬁeld (13) in the Hamiltonian (12) must be

exchanged by

In consequence, the atomic amplitudes As(z, t) and Bs(z, t) have to fulﬁll (14a,14b)-type equations where the
2νs = 2dEs/¯h (which is mean Rabi frequency in the standing wave),

following replacements must be performed: ν

As(z, t) = cos(2νs(t + τs) cos kz),
Bs(z, t) = i sin(2νs(t + τs) cos kz).

These amplitudes at the moment t = 0, when the standing wave is turned oﬀ, just present the initial amplitudes
A(z, 0) and B(z, 0) for interaction with the travelling wave (see the formulas (15a,15b). Using their χ(p)-expantions

where Jn(x) is Bessel function, for atomic center-of-mass motion probability amplitudes a(p, t) and b(p, t) we get the
following expressions:

sin νt J2m+1(2νsτs)] ,

b((2m + 1)¯hk, t) = i2m+1 [cos νt J2m+1(2νsτs) + sin νt J2m1(2νsτs)] ,
a((2m + 1)¯hk, t) = b(2m¯hk, t) = 0

−

The superposition state, created as a result of interaction with the standing wave, present the discrete mainﬁelds of
states, where the space between the adjacent values of momentum is 2¯hk, herewith the mainﬁelds for ground and
excited levels are totally shifted with respect to each other by ¯hk (the half of 2¯hk) [3].

The formulas (25a)-(25c) contain explicitly the seeking result about the evolution of momentum distributions. To
exhibit this evolution, let ﬁrst note that the initial momentum distribution for both energy levels are symmetric
relative to value p = 0. Really, they are speciﬁed by i2mJ2m(.) and i2m+1J2m+1(.) functions for ground and excited
(2m+1) transformations, that is just
energy levels respectively and are symmetric, relative to 2m
relative to value m = 0 (p = 0). This symmetry signiﬁes that the momentum of each energy level (as the incremental
(5), as the mean (20) values) is zero [3] before the interaction with the travelling wave. Nevertheless the symmetry
breaks under the <<inﬂuence>>of travelling wave: one photon absorption/emission process, in accordance with (25a)
and (25b), gives the beginning of asymmetric transformations in the form of momentum distributions, periodically
running in opposite directions for ground and excited energy levels.

2m, 2m+1

→ −

→ −

A typical form of initial distributions and the following redistributions (due to single-photon process) are depicted on
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 for ground and excited energy levels consequently. Single-photon large-scale changes are apparent.
Now let notice that in conditions of Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 we get almost one-side distributions: the translational states
with n > 0 for ground energy level only, and the translational states with n < 0 for excited level only. So, the state
of total atom has been explited into two sub-groups, where one sub-group presents ground-level atoms with negative
values of momentum, and the second sub-group presents vice-versa, the excited-level atoms with negative values of
momentum. Of course, this is a Stern-Gerlach type splitting. That is, one-photon optical transition implements the
resonant Kapitza-Dirac splitting into the Stern-Gerlach type splitting.

The phenomenon of one-photon coherent accumulation of momentum on energy levels (OP-CAMEL), may get
some expansion in exhibition, if the initial momentum distributions would be taken in asymmetric form. This kind of
distributions also can be obtained by the standing wave, but if some travelling wave is previous to it [5]. Such sequence
of pulses is got , if the standing wave is formed by means of reﬂection of a laser pulse from the distanted (from atomic
beam) mirror (see, for example [6],). To avoid the overloading of the text we aren’t going to bring formulas and the
behavior of the OP-CAMEL in these conditions will be given only by some graphs. In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 is presented
the case when the momentum distribution in resonant Kapitza-Dirac splitting is maximum asymmetric. As is seen
from the graphs, in this special case OP-CAMEL appears already as a accumulation of asymmetry on one (ground)
energy level for account of its suppressing on the other (excited) energy level.

IV. TIME EVOLUTION OF MEAN MOMENTUM ON GROUND AND EXCITED ENERGY LEVELS IN
THE FIELD OF TRAVELLING WAVE

Let us now return to the preparation only by the standing wave and discuss the evolution of momenta pg and pe.

By means of expressions for the quantities deﬁning pg and pe (see (18), (19) and (6), (7)) we will have

ﬁgures by dashed lines. In presented case the populations are constant in practice, which follows from (27) and (29)
too, if we take into account J0,1(2u) << 1 for u >> 1. And, ﬁnally, the temporal evolution of mean momenta pg

The parameters of the preparing standing wave are the same as in Fig. 2, where the distance between left-hand

has multiphoton nature (created by means of multiphoton process of reemission of photons from one wave into the

A simple theoretical consideration of optical transition in general conditions, when the atom initially has in su-
perposition state of ground and excited energy levels diﬀerent momentum distributions, shows that one one-photon
optical transition leads to radical asymmetric changes in momentum distributions on each energy level. Saying in
images, in general one photon changes the mean momentum of energy level more than photon’s own momentum.

In important case, when the preliminary superposition state of the atom is being prepared by coherent scattering at
the resonant standing wave, the phenomenon can be presented as a transition from resonant Kapitza-Dirac splitting
of atomic translational states to Stern-Gerlach type splitting. This is schematically depicted in Fig. 10.

V. SUMMARY

6

Finally, let’s give an account of some remarks about the possibility of experimental observation of phenomenon. Firs
let’s notice that the <<non-optical>>methods, which registrate the total atom (for example <<hot-wire>>method),
can’t be used for this purpose, because the phenomenon deals with each individual energy level; the momentum
distribution of total atom doesn’t change or which will be more right, it changes only in one-photon momentum
limits.

It is preferable to use registration methods, that will deal only with one of resonantly connected energy levels, such
as the adjacent optical transitions. Then the phenomenon will appear itself as a pronounced asymmetry in proﬁle of
Doppler broadening, relative to Bohr frequency. Another possibility we see in using of long-living energy levels, so
long that the atomic translational states can be distinguished in space till the spontaneous emission (C zone in Fig.

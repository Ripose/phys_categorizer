We onsider the proess of double photoionization (DPI) in a rare gas atom as a two-step proess, namely (i) photoion-

ization in an inner shell followed by (ii) the emission of an Auger eletron from an outer shell. An angular orrelation

funtion for the two emitted eletrons is de(cid:28)ned by analogy with the theory of angular orrelation in nulear physis. An

expression is obtained for this angular orrelation funtion by a statistial method whih makes use of the density and

e(cid:30)ieny operators. The latter takes are of the attenuation of the probability of detetion of an eletrons due to the

geometrial properties of the detetor. Theoretial values of the angular orrelation funtion are obtained for DPI in xenon

and these are shown to be in good agreement with the experimental results given by K¨ammerling and Shmidt [14℄.

1 Introdution

The theory of angular orrelation was originally formulated in nulear physis. This was done for two possible kinds of

phyial situation.

(i) Angular orrelation of suessive nulear radiations emitted by a radioative nulear speies, e.g. a γ

γ asade.

−

(ii) Angular orrelation of suessive nulear radiations resulting from the more general ase of a nulear sattering

proess.

The earliest paper on this sub jet was written by Hamilton [1℄ for the ase of a γ

γ asade. Later on, Gardner [2℄

−

wrote down the angular orrelation funtion using the wave funtions of the states ourring in a asade deay. Raah

[3℄ obtained thereafter a simple expression for the angular orrelation funtion in terms of the angle between the diretions

of emission of two suessive radiations emitted by a nuleus. He did not worry about the history of this nuleus, and his

theory held regardless of whether the emitted radiations onsisted of bosons or fermions. Subsequently, Biedenharn and

Rose [4℄ extended Raah's work to give a general form of the angular orrelation funtion for suessive nulear radiations.

About the same time, Coester and Jauh [5℄ gave a theory in the more general ontext of nulear reations. Their paper

gives a derivation of the angular orrelation funtion whih brings out the statistial nature of the problem. Later, Devons

and Goldfarb [6℄ wrote a detailed review of angular orrelations up to that point.

In our problem a rare gas atom absorbs a photon having spei(cid:28)ed properties i.e. energy, spin et. As a result, the atom

emits a photo-eletron giving rise to a singly harged ion. This ion now de-exites by emitting an Auger eletron. This

yields a doubly harged residual ion.

Note two basi features of this problem.

(i) The initial atomi state is randomly oriented ( an improper state or (cid:16)Gemish(cid:17)).

(ii) Only limited information is available about the emitted eletrons, usually their diretions of motion.

The density matrix or statistial matrix ρ was introdued into quantum mehanis to provide for the disussion of just

suh a situation [7, 15℄. It forms an important ingredient of the nulear theory of angular orrelations. It will naturally

(cid:28)gure in our atomi theory of angular orrelations as well.

In setion 2 we shall try to onstrut an angular orrelation funtion for the atomi problem outlined above. This is

done in setion 2.1 using a statistial approah . In setion 3 we report our alulation for the xenon atom whih was

experimentally studied by Shmidt and his o-workers[14℄.

2 An angular orrelation theory for atoms : the double photoionization

problem

Double photoionization (DPI) ours when an atomi target onsisting of rare gas atoms is irradiated with photons from

an advaned light soure, e.g. a synhrotron, and an atom emits two eletrons in quik suession. In ase the time interval

between the emission of these two eletrons is very small, one ould think of DPI as a one-step proess. A onsiderable

amount of work has already been done on this [12,13℄. However, in ase the time interval between the suessive emission of

the two eletrons is substantially longer than the time taken by the photo-eletron to leave the interation zone, DPI may

be regarded as a two-step proess [11℄. This in its turn will depend on the energy imparted to the atomi system by the

inident photon.

1

We shall now try to onstrut a theory for the two-step proess desribed above, keeping in view the earlier work done

in nulear physis. Sine this is a two-step proess mediated by eletromagneti interation at two verties, we expet it

to be a seond order proess as ompared to normal photoionization (PI). Hene the probability of its ourrene will be

muh lower than that of PI, and its detetion will all for muh greater preision.

1Se

Consider a randomly oriented rare gas atom in a

state. It absorbs a photon and after a ertain time interval emits

a photo-eletron from an inner shell, giving a single-vaany ioni state. This intermediate ioni state now de-exites by

emitting an Auger eletron, typially from an outer shell, giving rise to a two-vaany (cid:28)nal state [11℄.

So our proess amounts to

The initial state of our system is haraterized by the set of quantum numbers (JaMaαa), or by virtual quantum numbers

We wish to obtain an angular orrelation funtion for the two emitted eletrons in terms of the angle θ between their

quantum numbers, and αa, α′

diretions of emission.

2.1 The method of e(cid:30)ieny and density operators

We now approah the problem of angular orrelation from a statistial standpoint. We note that there is a ertain probability

for the atom to attain the (cid:28)nal state given above. This is desribed by the appropriate matrix element of the density or

statistial operator ρ as de(cid:28)ned in the literature [7,8℄. Now, even if the atom goes over to the (cid:28)nal state, beause of the

(cid:28)nite size of our deteting equipment and other limiting fators, this event may or may not be deteted. There is thus a

ertain probability ǫ (0
ε whih will depend on the size, position and geometrial arrangement of the deteting equipment.

1) that the event will be deteted. This probability is represented by the e(cid:30)ieny operator

≤

≤

ǫ

Now, how does the angular orrelation funtion relate to the operators ρ and ε? We shall try to answer this question in

the following manner. We start out by de(cid:28)ning

ε =

=
P

Q εQ

Q
ρ
|
h
|
Q εQρQQ

Q

i

= T r(ερ) .
P

Here εQ is the e(cid:30)ieny or probability of detetion of the state desribed by quantum numbers Q, and ρQQ the probability
of the system being in the partiular state Q.

From the elements of statistial mehanis, we know that ε is the expetation value ( or average value) of the e(cid:30)ieny

operator ε [8℄. We shall presently see that the angular orrelation funtion is simply related to ε.
Sine ε is the trae of a matrix it is invariant under a unitary transformation in Hilbert spae.
We now ask the question : what are the transformation properties of the matries ε and ρ as we go from one unitary
representation to another? It is easily seen that ε and ρ are tensor operators. Hene they are also alled the e(cid:30)ieny and
density (or statistial) tensors respetively [5℄. The fat that ε and ρ are both tensor operators makes them amenable to

further analysis.

Sine the initial atomi system is randomly oriented, we have rotational symmetry and angular momentum is onserved.

Hene our state vetors are eigenvetors of J2

and Jz . In suh a ase the matrix elements of a tensor operator have a simple

geometri dependene on the magneti quantum numbers. This is given by the Wigner-Ekart theorem.

Using the unitarity property of Clebsh-Gordan oe(cid:30)ients we get the density tensor of rank ka with (2ka+1) omponents

Using this theorem we write the matrix element of the density operator as

leads to photo-ionization in the 4d5/2 shell followed by an N5

Sine the initial photoionization proess is not haraterized by a single angular momentum quantum number but by

angular momentum quantum numbers orresponding to three possible hannels, the angular orrelation funtion desribed

in setion 2.1 above will be modi(cid:28)ed. The total intensity will, however, remain unhanged. If the photoionization hannels

We now de(cid:28)ne the angular orrelation funtion for this ase of hannel mixing by writing

W (θ) = [1 + b2P2(cosθ) + b4P4(cosθ)] .

(38)

(39)

(40)

Figure 1 gives the results of omparison between our theoretial values and the experimental values[14℄. It will be seen that

our polar plot of W (θ) agrees quite losely with that given by K¨ammerling and Shmidt [14℄ exept for a small di(cid:27)erene
in the region around θ = 0 degree and θ = 180 degree.

By using sattering theory with the appropriate boundary onditions, it is possible to obtain δ1 and δ2 without reourse
to the experimental urves. This in its turn should give not only a0 , but also b2 and b4 . This is the way our theory an be

used to predit the value of the angular orrelation funtion at any required angle. This would make our theory autonomous.

In the absene of multihannel interation, δ1 = δ2 = 0, Eq.(40) redues to Eq.(26).

The expetation value ε turns out to be the produt of a normalization fator depending on the redued matrix elements

and an angular fator. The simpliity of the latter is very striking. It seems as if the dynamial alulation involving the

radial matrix elements is redundant. Of ourse this is not true, beause to extrat dynamial properties of the system suh

as triply di(cid:27)erential ross setions (TDCS) we have to play with the normalizing fator. However, the very simpliity of the

result hinges on the fatorization of the problem into a dynamial part and an geometrial part depending on θ. This omes

from the use of Wigner-Ekart theorem, whih is a onsequene of the fat that we are dealing with the matrix elements of

Breit interaction correction to the hyperﬁne constant of an external s-electron in

many-electron atom

O.P. Sushkov

Sydney 2052, Australia

Correction to the hyperﬁne constant A of an external s-electron in many-electron atom caused
by the Breit interaction is calculated analytically: δA/A = 0.68Zα2. Physical mechanism for this
correction is polarization of the internal electronic shells (mainly 1s2 shell) by the magnetic ﬁeld
of the external electron. This mechanism is similar to the polarization of vacuum considered by
Karplus and Klein [1] long time ago. The similarity is the reason why in both cases (Dirac sea
polarization and internal atomic shells polarization) the corrections have the same dependence on
the nuclear charge and ﬁne structure constant.
In conclusion we also discuss Zα2 corrections to the parity violation eﬀects in atoms.

I. INTRODUCTION

Atomic hyperﬁne structure is caused by the magnetic interaction of the unpaired external electrons with the nuclear
magnetic moment. There are two types of relativistic corrections to this eﬀect. The ﬁrst type is a single particle
correction caused by the relativistic eﬀects in the wave equation of the external electron [2]. This correction is of the
order of (Zα)2, where Z is the nuclear charge and α is the ﬁne structure constant. Solving the Dirac equation one can
ﬁnd this correction analytically in all orders in (Zα)2 [3]. An alternative way to ﬁnd this correction is direct numerical
solution of the Dirac equation. Correction of the second type has a many-body origin: it is due to polarization of
paired electrons by the Breit interaction of the external electron. There are two kinds of paired electrons in the
problem: a) Dirac sea, b) closed atomic shells. The contribution related to the Dirac sea was calculated by Karplus
and Klein long time ago [1]: δA/A = α/2π − Zα2(5/2 − ln 2). The α/2π part is due to usual anomalous magnetic
moment and Zα2 part comes from a combined eﬀect of the Nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld and the Breit interaction. We
would like to stress that as soon as Z > 12 the Zα2 part is bigger than α/2π . Eﬀect of the polarization of atomic
shells by the Breit interaction has been recently calculated numerically [4–7]. These calculations were performed for
Cs (Z = 55) because they were motivated by the interest to parity nonconservation in this atom. Results of these
calculations are somewhat conﬂicting, but nevertheless they indicate that the correction for an external s-electron is of
the order of ∼ ±0.4%. In spite of being rather small this correction is comparable with the present accuracy of atomic
many-body calculations and therefore it must be taken into account. The purpose of the present work is to calculate
analytically the correction induced by the Breit interaction. This allows to elucidate the physical origin of the eﬀect
and its dependence on the atomic parameters. This also provides an important lesson for a similar correction to the
parity non-conserving amplitude which we discuss in the conclusion.

II. CONTRIBUTION OF THE DIRECT ELECTRON-ELECTRON MAGNETIC INTERACTION

In the present work we do not consider single particle relativistic eﬀects (Dirac equation), so we assume that in
zero approximation the atom is described by the Schroedinger equation with Coulomb electron-nucleus and electron-
electron interaction. For magnetic interaction throughout this work we use the Coulomb gauge. Vector potential and
magnetic ﬁeld of the nucleus are of the form

AN (r) =

µN × r

r3

HN (r) = ∇ × AN →

µN δ(r),

(1)

where µN is the magnetic moment of the nucleus. We keep only the spherically symmetric part of the magnetic ﬁeld
HN because in this work we consider only s-electrons. Interaction of the magnetic moment µ1 of the external electron
with nuclear magnetic ﬁeld gives the hyperﬁne structure

Here ψe(r) is the wave function of the external electron, and A is the hyperﬁne constant.

Vector potential of the external s-electron is of the form

Hence the magnetic ﬁeld is

Let us repeat once more that we keep only the spherically symmetric part of the magnetic ﬁeld.

The Hamiltonian of an internal electron in the magnetic ﬁeld A = AN + Ae, H = HN + He is given by

where µ2 is the magnetic moment of the internal electron. Certainly |µ1| = |µ2| = |e|¯h

and µ2 are independent. Having eq. (5) in mind one can easily draw diagrams describing correction to the hyperﬁne
structure due to the electron-electron magnetic interaction. This diagrams are shown in Fig.1

The diamagnetic contribution shown in Fig.1c is given by the A2 term from the Hamiltonian (5), hence

(8)

Before proceeding to the accurate calculation of δE it is instructive to estimate a magnitude of the correction. Let
us look for example at the diamagnetic correction (8). According to eqs. (1), (3) the vector potentials are AN ∼ µN /r2
and Ae ∼ µ1rψ2
e (0)/(mc2r), where r is the radius

e (0). Hence the correction (8) is of the order of δE ∼ e2µ1µN ψ2

of the internal shell. Since all the interactions are singular it is clear that the main contribution comes from the
K-shell, so r ∼ aB/Z (aB is the Bohr radius). Together with eq. (2) this gives the following relative value of the Breit
correction to the hyperﬁne constant δC/C ∼ Zα2. So we see that this eﬀect has exactly the same dependence on the
atomic parameters as the Dirac sea polarization considered in the paper [1].
Now let us calculate the coeﬃcient in the Zα2 correction. We consider explicitly only 1s and 2s closed shells
and we also need to consider the external s-electron. In atomic units the single particle energies of these states are:
E1 = −Z 2/2, E2 = −Z 2/8, Ee ≈ 0. At small distances the nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld is practically unscreened and hence
the wave functions are of the simple form [8]

Here ρ = Zr and J1(x) is the Bessel function. The functions ψ1,2 are normalized in the usual way: R ψ2

i d3ρ = 1.
The wave function of the external electron is normalized by the condition ψ2
e (0) = 3/(8π). With this normalization
the leading order hyperﬁne constant (2) is equal to unity, C = 1, and therefore this normalization is convenient for
calculation of the relative value of the Breit correction to the hyperﬁne constant. Using eqs. (1),(3),(8) and performing
summation over spins in the closed shells one ﬁnds the diamagnetic correction

The numerical coeﬃcient was found by straightforward numerical integration. Contributions of the inner shells drop
down approximately as 1/n3, so 0.230=0.207+0.023, where the ﬁrst contribution comes from the 1s-shell and the
second contribution comes from the 2s-shell.

To calculate the paramagnetic contributions (6) we use corrections δψn deﬁned by eq. (7) and calculated in the
Appendix. Substitution of (4), (9), and (A9) into formula (6) and summation over electron spins in the closed shell
gives the following result

where we present explicitly the contributions of 1s- and 2s-shells. The numerical coeﬃcient is found by numerical
integration. Similar to the diamagnetic term the contributions of the inner shells drop down approximately as 1/n3.
The leading order hyperﬁne structure is given by eq. (2) with constant C = 1 due to the accepted normalization.
According to eqs. (10) and (11) the total correction caused by the direct magnetic interaction is δEa + δEb + δEc =
−0.410Zα2(µ1 · µN ). Comparing this with eq. (2) one ﬁnds the relative value of the direct correction:

FIG. 2. Diagrams describing the exchange Breit interaction correction to the hyperﬁne structure. The diagrams a) and b)
give the paramagnetic contribution, and the diagram c) gives the diamagnetic contribution. N denotes the nucleus, e denotes the
external electron, n denotes the internal electron, and ﬁnally m denotes a virtual excitation of the internal electron. The wavy
line shows magnetic interaction with the external electron, and the dashed line shows magnetic interaction with the nucleus.

The diagrams Fig.2a,b show the “paramagnetic” contributions, and the diagram Fig.2c shows the ”diamagnetic”
contribution. Note that the contributions of the diagrams Fig.2a,b must be doubled because the opposite order of
operators is also possible. Let us begin with the “dimagnetic” term. Comparison of Fig.1c and Fig.2c shows that the
direct and the exchange contributions are very similar and therefore the simplest way to derive the exchange term
is just to make appropriate alterations in eq. (10) which gives the direct contribution. The alterations are obvious:
1)opposite sign, 2)ψ2
e → ψeψn, 4)there is no summation over the intermediate spins, hence 4/3 → 2/3.
Thus the result is

The coeﬃcient is found by numerical integration: 0.107=0.096+0.011, where the ﬁrst contribution comes from the

The paramagnetic exchange contribution shown in Fig.2b is similar to the direct ones given by Fig.1a,b. The only
diﬀerence is in algebra of Pauli matrixes and in additional sign (-). This consideration shows that the paramagnetic
exchange contribution is equal to half of that given by eq. (11)

The diagram shown in Fig.2a does not have analogous direct diagram because it has the hyperﬁne interaction
attached to the line of the external electron. Nevertheless the calculation of this diagram is quite similar to the
calculation described by eqs. (6) and (7). After substitution of δψe from (A13) and performing summation over the

In the calculation we have not used the explicit form of the Breit interaction, but nevertheless this is the correction

(18)

Here r = r1 − r2 is distance between the electrons, and αi is the α-matrix of the corresponding electron. The Breit
interaction correction to the hyperﬁne structure of Cs was previously calculated numerically in the works [4–7],

4

but results of these calculations were somewhat conﬂicting. Our result (17) agrees with that of the most recent
computation [7]. Note that eq. (17) gives the leading in Z part of the Breit correction. There are other parts, say the
correction to the energy of the external electron which directly inﬂuence the hyperﬁne constant. However the other
parts contain lower powers of Z.

The correction (17) does not include all Zα2 terms. To realize what is left let us look at the electron-electron

interaction Hamiltonian in (v/c)2 approximation [9]

Here pi, si denote the momentum and the spin of the electron. All the terms containing momenta vanish for s-
electrons, the two last terms are already taken into account by the calculation performed above, however the ﬁrst
term has not been considered yet. The matter is that in spite of being a (v/c)2-correction it has a nonmagnetic origin.
It comes from the (v/c)-expansion of the electron-electron Coulomb interaction 1
2u2), where ui is the Dirac
spinor of the corresponding electron. This is why this term is accounted automatically in the Dirac-Hartree-Fock
calculations [10,4–7]. Nevertheless if one wants to separate the total Zα2 correction analytically then the ﬁrst term
must be also considered explicitly. Since this term is spin independent, it can contribute only via exchange diagrams. A
straightforward calculation very similar to that performed above gives the following result for the Coulomb correction.

V. BREIT INTERACTION CORRECTION TO THE PARITY NONCONSERVATION EFFECT

The Breit interaction correction exists for both nuclear spin independent (weak charge) and nuclear spin dependent
(anapole moment) weak interactions. The correction to the spin independent eﬀect is the most interesting one because
of the high precision in both atomic theory [11] and experiment [12,13]. Recent computations [6,7] show that the
atomic Breit correction to the nuclear spin-independent parity nonconservation (PNC) eﬀect in Cs is about 0.6%.
This is enough to inﬂuence interpretation of the experimental data, see Refs. [13,6]. The Breit correction to the PNC
eﬀect can be calculated analytically similar to the hyperﬁne structure correction. However this calculation is out of
the scope of the present work. In the present paper I just want a) to estimate this correction parametrically, b) to
comment on the importance of the Dirac sea polarization. Let us ﬁrst estimate the correction. It is given by the
diagrams similar to that shown in Fig.2a,b. The only diﬀerence is that the electron-nucleus magnetic interaction must
be replaces by the electron-nucleus weak interaction [14]

HW =

G

2√2m

QW [s · pδ(r) + δ(r)s · p],

(23)

where G is the Fermi constant, and QW is the weak charge. The relative value of the Breit correction is

5

δhHWi / hHWi ∼

α2/r3
∆E ∼

α2Z 3
Z 2 ∼ Zα2.

(24)

Here α2/r3 is the magnetic interaction between external and internal electrons, and ∆E is the excitation energy of the
virtual state of the internal electron. For the estimation we take K-electrons, therefore r ∼ 1/Z, and ∆E ∼ Z 2. Thus
the Breit correction to the PNC eﬀect has exactly the same dependence on atomic parameters as the Breit correction to
the hyperﬁne structure. It is known that there is a large relativistic enhancement factor for PNC eﬀect [14], therefore
one might think that the nonrelativistic expansion used in the estimate (24) has very poor accuracy. However it is
not the case, the matter is that the large relativistic factor appears from the distances r ∼ nuclear size ≪ aB/Z,
therefore this factor is more or less the same for the external electron and for the K-electron. So it is canceled out in
the ratio (24). By the way a similar argument explains a relatively high accuracy of the nonrelativistic expansion for
the hyperﬁne structure correction (17).

I would like also to comment on the importance of the Dirac sea polarization. The eﬀect calculated in refs. [6,7] and
estimated in eq. (24) is caused by the polarization of the closed atomic shells. This is analogous to the contribution
(17) for the hyperﬁne structure. However one has to remember that for the hyperﬁne correction there is also the
contribution of the Dirac sea polarization [1], α/2π − Zα2(5/2 − ln 2) ≈ α/2π − 1.81Zα2, which is bigger and has
the opposite sign. Only account of both eﬀects together (atomic shells + Dirac sea) has the physical meaning. The
radiative correction to the nuclear weak charge is known in the single loop approximation, see Ref. [15]. This includes
α/π and α/π ln(MZ/µ) terms (MZ is the Z-boson mass and µ is some infrared cutoﬀ). However Zα2 radiative
correction to the weak charge has not been considered yet and it is quite possible that this correction is larger than
the α/π contribution (at least this is so for the hyperﬁne constant). To calculate Zα2 radiative correction one needs
to go to the two loop approximation, or to work in the single loop approximation but with the Green’s functions
in the external nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld. Thus: 1) account of the Breit correction calculated numerically in Refs. [6,7]
and estimated in eq. (24) without account of the Dirac sea contribution is not suﬃcient, 2) account of the Dirac sea
polarization can inﬂuence agreement between theory and experiment.

VI. CONCLUSION

Correction to the hyperﬁne constant A of an external s-electron in many-electron atom caused by the polarization
of inner atomic shells by the electron-electron Breit interaction is calculated analytically: δA/A = 0.68Zα2. This
correction has the same origin as the Dirac sea polarization eﬀect δA/A = α/2π − Zα2(5/2 − ln 2) calculated by
Karplus and Klein long time ago [1].
It has been shown that the parametric estimate for the Breit correction to the parity nonconservation eﬀects is also
Zα2. We stress that to take this correction into account one needs to consider both polarization of the inner atomic
shells and polarization of the Dirac sea.

W. R. Johnson for communicating me results of their calculations [7] prior to the publication.

that there is the additional condition of orthogonality

which follows from eq. (7). Having the perturbation (A2) it is convenient to represent δψn in the form

where ρ = Zr. Substitution of (A5) into (A1) shows that the functions f (ρ) obey the following equations

w2 = 1 − 2ρ[(1 − ρ/2) ln ρ − 3/4 + c] − (13/4 − c)2ρ2 + ρ3/4,

where c = 0.577215 is the Euler constant. Altogether eqs. (A5), (A7), and (A8) give

We also need to know the hyperﬁne correction to the wave function of the external electron. Basically it is also
given by eq. (A1), but there is a special point concerning normalization. We use an artiﬁcial normalization condition
e (0) = 3/(8π), see eq. (A8). On the other hand the correct normalization is R ψ2
ψ2
e (r)d3r = 1 and hence ψe(0) ∝ E3/2,
where E is energy of the electron. There are two terms in the right hand side of eq. (A1), the ﬁrst term is proportional
to E3/2 and the second one is proportional to E9/2. For an external electron E → 0 and hence the second term must be
neglected. After that the equation (A1) is getting linear in ψ and we can return to the normalization ψ2
e (0) = 3/(8π).
Similar to (A5) it is convenient to use the substitution

where fe satisﬁes the equation

Note that due to the diﬀerent normalization of ψe the coeﬃcient in the right hand side of eq. (A10), including power
of Z is diﬀerent from that in eq. (A5). Solution of eq. (A11) is

(A12)

where N1(x) is the singular Bessel function. At small x this function behaves as N1 ≈ −2/πx, therefore fe(ρ) has

(A14)

This integral is not well deﬁned at ∞. The origin for this is clear: we are working with zero energy state. To correct
the situation, one has to introduce an exponential factor e−βx2

and then to consider the limit β → 0.

The Conﬁguration Interaction (CI) method using a very large Laguerre orbital basis is applied
to the calculation of the He ground state. A minimum of 35 radial orbitals for each partial wave
ranging from 0 to 12 are included resulting in a basis with a total of 465 orbitals. The convergence
of the energy and electron-electron δ-function with respect to J (the maximum angular momenta of
the orbitals included in the CI expansion) are investigated in detail. It is seen that the convergence
properties of some previous very large calculations show irregularities. The J → ∞ limit of the
2 )−5 + . . .,
energy was obtained by ﬁtting to expansions of the type ∆EJ = AE(J + 1
giving an energy about 10−7 hartree from the exact energy. Convergence issues caused problems
when trying to determine the J → ∞ limit of hδi using a similar asymptotic expansion and the
biggest calculations achieved accuracies between 0.2 and 0.5 %.

INTRODUCTION

Large conﬁguration interaction (CI) calculations of the
helium ground state are performed here in order to more
precisely elucidate the convergence properties of the CI
expansion for this atom. The general properties of the
CI expansion have been known since the seminal work of
Schwartz [1], which provided the underlying foundation
for the later analytic and computational investigations
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The CI expansion using single cen-
ter orbitals is slowly convergent with respect to J, the
maximum angular momentum of any orbital included in
the CI expansion. In particular, the leading term to the
energy increment is expected to behave at high J as:

∆EJ = hEiJ − hEiJ−1 ≈

AE
(J + 1

2 )4 .

Although there have been a number of very large CI
calculations performed on helium, all of these earlier cal-
culations treat the higher J contributions to the energy
with less precision than the low J contributions. Typ-
ically, the number of radial orbitals for the high ℓ are
smaller than the number of low ℓ. The justiﬁcation for
this is that the high ℓ partial waves make a smaller con-
tribution to the energy and other expectation values of
than the low ℓ orbitals. At ﬁrst sight this approach would
seem reasonable for obtaining estimates of the total en-
ergy. However, this approach does lead to problems when
studying the convergence properties of CI expansion it-

self. Here it is necessary to ensure that the successive
contributions to the energy are obtained with the same
relative accuracy and this can hardly be guaranteed with
a radial basis that decreases in size as ℓ increases.

One purpose of the present calculations is ostensibly
to gain an improved insight into the mechanics of ex-
trapolating the partial wave expansion inherent to all CI
calculations to the J → ∞ limit. Besides looking at
the energy, the convergence of the CI expansion of the
electron-electron δ-function is also studied.

The primary motivation, however, was a need to better
understand the convergence issues that manifest them-
selves much more severely in the related positron-atom
problem. The CI method has recently been applied
to the study of positronic atoms (electronically sta-
ble states consisting of a positron bound to an atom)
[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] and also to positron-
atom scattering states [19, 20, 21]. The attractive
electron-positron interaction leads to the formation of a
Ps cluster (i.e. something akin to a positronium atom)
in the outer valence region of the atom [16, 18, 22, 23].

The accurate representation of a Ps cluster using only
single particle orbitals centered on the nucleus requires
the inclusion of orbitals with much higher angular mo-
menta than a roughly equivalent electron-only calcula-

considered, namely e+Li, a calculation with J = 30
was required before the energy had decreased enough
to establish binding. Given that helium is described
as slowly convergent [1], one struggles to ﬁnd an adjec-
tive that could characterize the convergence properties of
positronic systems!
The two most

for
positronic systems are the energy, and the rate for

important expectation values

electron-positron annihilation. The annihilation rate,
which is proportional to the expectation of the electron-
positron δ-function, has the inconvenient property that it
is even more slowly convergent than the energy with re-
spect to orbital angular momentum. One has successive
increments decreasing at high J according to [7, 12, 27]:

∆ΓJ = hΓiJ − hΓiJ−1 ≈

AΓ
(J + 1

2 )2 ,

(2)

To put this in perspective, it would take a calculation
with J ≈ 250 to recover 99% of the PsH annihilation
rate [28]. Given that the annihilation operator is a delta-
function in the electron-positron coordinates it makes
sense to study the convergence of the electron-electron
delta function for the helium ground state.

The present large basis CI calculations of the He
ground state were done to study the properties of the par-
tial wave expansion of the wave function. Since the prop-
erties of the He ground state are known to high precision
it is is used as a laboratory to test diﬀerent methods of
extrapolating the partial wave expansion to completion.
The insights obtained from helium should be applicable
to positronic systems.

II. THE CI CALCULATIONS

The CI wave function in a single-center basis is a linear
combination of anti-symmetrised two-electron states with
the usual Clebsch-Gordan coupling coeﬃcients,

|Ψ; LSi =

cij Aij

hℓimiℓjmj|LMLi h 1

2 µi

1

2 µj|SMSi

Xi,j

×

φi(r1)φj (r2)

.

(3)

The functions φ(r) are single electron orbitals written as
a product of a radial function and a spherical harmonic:

φ(r) = P (r)Yℓm(ˆr) .

(4)

The set of radial wave functions are Laguerre Type Or-
bitals (LTOs) with a common exponential parameter
which ensures orthogonality [12, 13]. The LTO basis has
the property that the basis can be expanded toward com-
pleteness without inducing any linear dependence prob-
lems. The CI basis can be characterized by the index
J, the maximum orbital angular momentum of any sin-
gle electron orbital included in the expansion of the wave
function.

Two sets of calculations have been performed for the
He ground state.
In the ﬁrst set, there were 20 LTOs
per ℓ with the largest calculation including orbitals up

discussion, the energy diﬀerences ∆EJ are also tabulated between the J and (J −1) rows of hEiJ . The energies in the column
CSM are taken from largest explicit calculation by CSM while those in the column CSM∞ are the estimated energies in an

to ℓ = 12. The LTO exponents for a given ℓ were the
same and the values of the exponents were optimized in
a quasi-perturbative fashion. The exponents for ℓ = 0, 1
and 2 orbitals were optimized in a CI calculation with all
60 orbitals. The exponents for ℓ > 2 were optimized sep-
arately for each ℓ with CI calculations that also included
the ℓ = 0, 1, 2 orbitals. Once the exponents were opti-
mized, a sequence of calculations to give the energy and
δ-function for successive J were carried out. The results
of these calculations are reported in Table I.

The second set of calculations were much larger. Here
there were 35 LTOs per ℓ with the exception of ℓ = 0 and
1 where respectively 44 and 36 LTOs were used respec-
tively. The orbital exponents were optimized for each ℓ in
a manner similar to that described above and the calcula-
tions were taken to J = 12. A total of 465 single electron
orbitals were included in the largest calculation, which
required the diagonalization of a hamiltonian matrix of
dimension 8586.

All observable quantities can be deﬁned symbolically

hXiJ =

∆X L ,

J

XL=0

(5)

(7)

where ∆X J is the increment to the observable that oc-
curs when the maximum orbital angular momentum is
increased from J − 1 to J, e.g.

∆X J = hXiJ − hXiJ−1 .

Hence, one can write formally

hXi∞ = hXiJ +

∆X L .

∞

XL=J+1

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side will be determined
by explicit computation while the second term must be
estimated. The problem confronting all single center cal-
culations is that part of hXi∞ arises from terms with

ℓ-values that are not included in the largest explicit cal-
culation. For helium, terms with ℓ > 2 contribute only
0.033% of the total energy. For purely electronic systems
these higher ℓ terms make a small (but slowly convergent)
correction to the total energy and other expectation val-
ues. The two expectation values that were investigated
were that of the energy hEi∞ and the electron-electron
δ-function hδi∞ = hδ(r1 − r2)i∞ Results for the energy
and δ-function expectation values are given in Table I.

INVESTIGATION OF THE PARTIAL WAVE

SEQUENCE

The extrapolation schemes used later in this paper
have their basis in the work of Schwartz [1], Hill [3] and
Kutzelnigg and associates [4, 7]. Analytic work indicates
that the energy increments are given by

∆EJ =

AE
(J + 1

2 )4 +

BE
(J + 1

2 )5 +

CE
(J + 1

2 )6 + . . .

where

AE = −6π2

|Ψ(r, r, 0)|2r5dr = −0.074226

BE = −

given a two-body wavefunction Ψ(r1, r2, |r1 − r2|). No
estimates for CE are known by us to exist. At large J,
one expects the energy increments to be well described
by eq. (1).

For the δ-function one can write

∆δJ =

Aδ
(J + 1

where Aδ has been conjectured [27] to be

(this expression is slightly diﬀerent from that given in
[27] for electron-positron annihilation since we have di-
vided by πr2

variational wave function of the He ground state with ba-
sis of 250 explicitly correlated gaussians and an energy
of -2.9037243752 hartree.

A. Comparison of the partial wave increments

The validity of these results can be tested by looking at
the energy increments of large CI calculations of helium.
Besides the present calculations, data from a number of
previous CI calculations have been used. One of the most
impressive calculations was that by Carroll, Silverstone
and Metzger (CSM) [2] who used a piece-wise polynomial
basis to construct a natural orbital expansion. Besides

performing some very large calculations they also esti-
mated the completeness limit of their radial basis. The
largest explicit calculation by CSM will be termed the
CSM calculation while the extrapolated calculation will
be denoted as CSM∞. Also worthy of comparison are the
very large CI calculations by Sims and Hagstrom (SH)
[8]. One drawback with their calculation was the use of
a Slater Type Orbital basis. They had to resort to very
high precision (REAL*24) arithmetic to avoid the impact
of linear dependence. Finally, a very large calculation us-
ing B-splines has been performed by Decleva, Lisini and
Venuti (DLV) [5]. They obtained energies, hEiJ , close to
the variational limit for J ≤ 4 and obtained estimates of
∆EJ for J ≤ 80. Other notable calculations have been
performed by Jitrik and Bunge [6] and Kutzelnigg and
Morgan [4].

Table II gives the energies of the present 20LTO and
35LTO basis sets, along with the CSM, SH and DLV cal-
culations. These same sets of data are also presented as
energy diﬀerences between consecutive calculations δEJ .
The present calculations are superior to the explicit CSM
and SH calculations. The DLV calculations for J ≤ 3
were exhaustive and give a reliable indication of the in-
completeness of the 35LTO basis (best seen in the δEJ
increments). The estimated CSM∞ energies show irregu-
larities of the order 10−8 hartree. It is noticeable that the
hEi12 energy of the CSM∞ calculation is slightly larger
than the present 35LTO basis at J = 12. This is an indi-
cation of imperfections in the CSM extrapolation with re-
spect to their radial basis since the CSM∞ energy should
be slightly more negative then our best calculations.

A useful way to scrutinize the partial wave series is to

assume a power law decay of the form

and determine the value of p for a succession of three

The exponent derived from the energy increments is pE
while the exponent derived from the δ-function incre-
ments is pδ. One expects pE → 4 [1] and pδ → 2 as
J → ∞ [7, 27], in agreement with eqs. (8) and (11).

The values of pE for the He energies presented in Table
II are plotted in Figure 1 as a function of J. One of
the noticeable features of Figure 1 are the irregularities
in some of the calculations, e.g.
the SH trajectory at
the larger values of J, and the CSM calculation at all
values of J. Although it is not shown in Figure 1, a plot
of the pE versus J for the CI calculation of Jitrik and
Bunge [6] also showed irregularities. The irregularities in
the CSM plot arise as a result of the truncation of the
NO expansion to a ﬁnite number of radial terms. These
irregularities are diminished for the CSM∞ plot which
sits almost on top of the curve for the 20LTO basis. Both
curves exhibit a tendency for pE to level out and even
start increasing at the larger values of J.

The two largest calculations, the DLV and 35LTO cal-
culations have pE versus J trajectories that are quite
close. Both curves steadily decrease with increasing J
with the value of pE appearing to approach the expected

value of 4.0 from above. At J = 12 the 35LTO basis
gave pE = 4.037. The 20LTO basis on the other hand
gave pE = 4.055. Examination of the CSM∞ trajectory
shows that it ﬂattens out for J ≥ 8. In eﬀect, the only
calculations that are still consistent with the asymptotic
limit of eq. (8) are the 35LTO and DLV calculations. The
conclusion that is drawn from Figure 1 is that a larger
radial basis is needed to represent the high ℓ part of the
wave function.

The incremental exponent for the δ-function, pδ is
shown in Figure 2 for the 20LTO and 35LTO basis sets.
It should be noted that the values of pδ was quite sen-
sitive to the precision of the calculation. Originally, the
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian was performed using
the Davidson algorithm [29]. However, this method could
not give δ-function expectation values to better than 8
signiﬁcant ﬁgures (irrespective of the convergence toler-
ance for the energy). This lead to noticeable ﬂuctuations
in the pδ versus J plot! The diagonalization was subse-
quently performed using the EISPACK libraries, reduc-
ing the size of the ﬂuctuations. The trajectory of the
20LTO does not appear to be approaching the pδ → 2
limit as pδ is actually increasing for J > 6. At J = 12 one
obtains pδ = 2.155. The 35LTO basis also exhibits the
tendency for pδ vs J trajectory to ﬂatten out and then
start increasing, but the eﬀect is much less pronounced.
At J = 12 one obtains pδ = 2.064 for the 35LTO basis.

The behavior exhibited in Figures 1 and 2 can be at-
tributed to the convergence of the radial basis. A larger
radial basis is required to predict successive ∆EJ incre-
ments as J increases. The ratio

35LTO basis sets to a J energy increment. One can deﬁne
a similar ratio, RJ

δ , for the δ-function ∆δJ increments.

E and RJ

The behavior of these ratios versus J are depicted in
Figure 3. Both RJ
δ increase smoothly with J,
with hδiJ being much more sensitive to the increase in the
dimension of the radial basis. There was a 6% increase in
∆δ12 when the radial basis dimension per ℓ was increased
from 20 to 35 LTOs with a corresponding 0.7% increase in
the ∆E12. This extra sensitivity of hδiJ is something we
have noticed in calculations of positron annihilation rates
in positron-atom systems [13, 14, 19, 20] even though
explicit mention of this point has not been made.

of eq. (8) or eq. (11) are used. Four successive values of
hXiJ are used to determine AX , BX and CX when the
three leading terms of eq. (8) or eq. (11) are used. The ﬁts
to determine AX and/or BX and/or CX can be done to
diﬀerent sequences of J values as a self-consistency check
that, for example, using two-term ﬁts to the J = 8, 9, 10
or J = 10, 11, 12 sets of hXiJ will give answers that are
numerically close together.

Once the coeﬃcients of the inverse power series have
been determined, the J → ∞ contribution is determined
by a two-step procedure. Firstly, the series (8) and (11)
are summed explicitly up to J +200. The remainder from
≥ J + 201 is determined using the approximate result:

One of the major points of this paper was to determine
whether it is possible to extract the J → ∞ limit from a
ﬁnite sequence of calculations. To this end, we ﬁt inverse
power series of diﬀerent length to a sequence of hXiJ
data, and then those inverse power series are summed to
inﬁnity.

Equations (8) and (11) are the working equations.
We perform ﬁts retaining just the leading order term
(Method 1), the ﬁrst two terms (Method 2), and the
ﬁrst three terms (Method 3) of these series. The ﬁts of
these equations use the minimum information necessary.
So, Method 1, which only retains the ﬁrst AE term of
eq. (8), only requires two successive values of hEiJ to
determine AE. Three successive values of hXiJ are used
to determine AX and BX when the two leading terms

Eq. (16) can be regarded as an approximation to the
∞
2 )−2 dL integral using the mid-point rule. This
J+1(L + 1
approximation is accurate, for example, to 0.1% for p = 2
R
and J = 7.

Figures 4 and 5 show the behavior of the extrapolated
E and δ-function for the three diﬀerent extrapolations
as a function of J. Table I gives estimates of hEi∞ and
hδi∞ using the calculated values at the largest possible
J values to determine the J → ∞ corrections.

Figure 4 shows that the quality of the energy extrap-
olation using Method 1 is inferior to Methods 2 and 3
which give roughly the same energy for J ≥ 8. The
over-estimation of the energy by Methods 2 and 3 is a
consequence of using a large but not quite complete ra-
dial basis and the energy also shows a tendency to creep

up as J increases. But Methods 2 and 3 generally achieve
an accuracy of about 1 × 10−7 hartree over an extended
J range. As shown in Figure 3, the relative underesti-
mation associated with a ﬁnite radial basis does tend to
increase as J increases, and this leads to the magnitude
of extrapolation correction being increasingly underesti-
mated as J increases. The most accurate estimate at
J = 12 is that from Method 1, but Figure 4 suggests
that this agreement is accidental.

The diﬃculties in obtaining sub 0.1% accuracy for
hδi∞ are quite apparent from Figure 5. As one increases
J, the estimates of hδi∞ also increase and the discrep-
ancy with the accurate value of Drake [26] gets larger.
The ultimate accuracy achieved here lies somewhere be-
tween 0.1 and 0.5%. Figure [26] superﬁcially suggests
that Method 1 is the best algorithm to perform the ex-
trapolation. This occurs because hδiJ is decreasing with
J and the ﬁnite radial basis leads to the ∆hδiJ incre-
ments being too small in magnitude. Method 1 with a
2 )−2 form will gives the largest J → ∞ correc-
pure (L + 1
tion and thus compensate for the error resulting from the
ﬁnite radial basis. Usage of a larger radial basis would
result in smaller values of hδiJ , probably resulting in a
hδi∞ curve that approached the correct limit from be-
low. In this case, Method 1 would then give the worst
estimate of hδi∞.

D. The coeﬃcients of the inverse power series

The coeﬃcients of the asymptotic form are known from
eqs. (9), (10) and (12). Estimates of these parameters
are also obtained during the ﬁt of the inverse power
series to a set of hEiJ or hδiJ . We note that CSM∞
give AE = −0.0740 and BE = 0.031 [2]. The very
large calculations of DLV reported AE = −0.07415 and
BE = 0.0317 [2]. Both DLV and CSM obtained these es-
timates by performing a least-squares ﬁt over a range of
J values. The AE are within 0.2% of the eq. (9) estimate,
and the BE are within about 2% of the BE of eq. (10).
One might conclude that very accurate estimates of the
coeﬃcients can reliably be obtained by ﬁtting a series of
energies to eq. (8). Such a conclusion, however, is prob-
ably overoptimistic as we now demonstrate.

One way to illustrate the uncertainties associated with
these determinations of AE and BE is to perform the
ﬁts to eq. (8) over diﬀerent ranges of J and check that
the AE coeﬃcient remains constant. Figure 6 shows the
variation obtained from the diﬀerent calculations of AE
over a range of J values. Fits were performed with both
Methods 2 and 3 for the 35LTO and DLV energy sets, and
just with Method 2 for the CSM∞ energy set (there were
large ﬂuctuations in AE for this data set when Method
3 was used). The AE coeﬃcients for a given method
are computed using the minimum range of J values that
permit the unique determination of the coeﬃcients.

Application of Method 2 to the 35LTO data yields val-
ues of AE that change from -0.07413 at J = 7 to -0.07384
at J = 12. Changing to Method 3 results in values of AE
that range from -0.07426 at J = 7 to -0.07340 at J = 12.
The values of AE obtained from Method 3 show a higher
degree of variability than those obtained by Method 2.
The likely reason for this is that the more sophisticated
Method 3 is more sensitive to small ﬂuctuations in the
energy increments, and it is known from Figure 3 that
the energy increments tend to be systematically under-
estimated as J increases. It is also noticed that the value
of AE derived from the DLV energy data using Method
3 also shows a higher degree of variability than when de-
rived using Method 2.

Figure 7 shows the values Aδ as obtained by Methods
1, 2 and 3 as a function of J. None of the methods
produce an estimate of Aδ that can be guaranteed to be
accurate at the 1% level. The inability to estimate Aδ
below this precision is almost certainly due to the very
slow convergence with respect to the dimension of the
radial basis set.

Finally, it must be emphasized that Aδ was very sen-
sitive to the precision at which hδiJ was computed. Ir-
regularities of ±2% were present when the hamiltonian
diagonalization was initially performed with the David-
son algorithm resulting in hδiJ values with, at most, 8
reliable digits. Care must be taken in extracting as many
signiﬁcant ﬁgures as possible from the CI wavefunction,
especially when invoking Methods 2 and 3.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Results of a set of very large CI calculations of the
He ground state have been presented. Use of techniques
to extend the partial wave expansion of the energy to
completion resulted in a He ground state energy that
was accurate to 1.4 × 10−7 hartree.

However, the prediction of the electron-electron δ-
function is considerably more diﬃcult, and it is not pos-
sible to guarantee an accuracy better than 1% even when
extrapolation techniques are used. Besides the slow con-
vergence with ℓ, there is also a convergence problem con-
cerning the number of radial basis functions. If the num-
ber of radial basis functions per ℓ is kept the same then
the relative accuracy of successive ∆δJ increments de-
creases as J increases.

We should note that investigations of the convergence
with respect to dimension of the radial basis, i.e. N were
also undertaken. A crude estimate of the inﬁnite basis
limit was obtained by assuming the δ-function expecta-

8

tion values converged as N −q where N is the number of
LTOs for a given ℓ. This estimate indicated that even a
basis with 35 LTOs per ℓ will result in the ∆δJ increments
being underestimated by about 5% by J = 12. The ef-
fects of any systematic underestimations of ∆δJ at high
J are magniﬁed when extrapolation to the J → ∞ limit
is done. However, the convergence pattern of each hEiJ
and hδiJ with N revealed complexities that precluded the
development of a reliable N → ∞ extrapolation scheme.
A complete discussion of this aspect of the problem is
deferred until greater understanding is achieved.

These results have disturbing implications for the pre-
diction of the annihilation rate of positronic atoms from
single-center CI type calculations. Some sort of extrapo-
lation in J is necessary in order to determine the energy
and more particularly the annihilation rate. One way to
minimize the impact of the extrapolation is to run the
calculation to the highest possible angular momentum.
However, the high J parts of the annihilation rate will
tend to be increasingly underestimated as J increases,
and this can easily lead to the J → ∞ extrapolation
becoming less reliable.

While the resolution of the problem is postponed to
the future, it is worth mentioning two possible lines of
attack that may improve the convergence.
In the ﬁrst
case, one can replace the localized δ-function by an op-
erator that depends more on the global properties of the
wave function [30, 31]. Alternatively, one might attempt
to compute the coeﬃcient Aδ directly from the ground
state wave function. This may be better than using a
series of ∆δJ increments which become less reliable as J
increases.

Abstract

The locality hypothesis in density-functional theory (DFT) states that the functional
derivative of the Hohenberg-Kohn universal functional can be expressed as a local multi-
plicative potential function, and this is the basis of DFT and of the successful Kohn-Sham
model. Nesbet has in several papers [Phys. Rev. A 58, R12 (1998); ibid. A 65, 010502 (2001);
Adv. Quant. Chem, 43, 1 (2003)] claimed that this hypothesis is in conﬂict with fundamental
quantum physics, and as a consequence that the Hohenberg-Kohn theory cannot be generally
valid. We have in a Comment to the Physical Review [Phys. Rev. A 67, 056501 (2003)] com-
mented upon these works and recently extended the arguments [Adv. Quant. Chem. 43, 95
(2003)]. We have shown that there is no such conﬂict and that the locality hypothesis is inher-
ently exact. In the present work we have furthermore veriﬁed this numerically by constructing
a local Kohn-Sham potential for the 1s2s 3S state of helium that generates the many-body
electron density and shown that the corresponding 2s Kohn-Sham orbital eigenvalue agrees
with the ionization energy to nine digits. Similar result is obtained with the Hartree-Fock
density. In addition to verifying the locality hypothesis, this conﬁrms the theorem regarding
the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue of the highest occupied orbital.

Introduction

The locality hypothesis is the corner stone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the basis for
the widely used Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham model [1, 2]. The central issue is whether the functional
derivatives of the density functionals used in DFT are strictly local potential functions, and whether
a Kohn-Sham model with local potential could lead to the exact result for ground states of arbitrary
electronic systems.

Nesbet has in a series of papers claimed that the locality hypothesis is in conﬂict with Fermi-
Dirac statistics and the exclusion principle [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
with the consequence that traditional DFT generally does not work for systems with more than

two electrons. This result has been challenged by G´al [21], by Holas and March [22, 23], as well
as by us [24]. We have also recently discussed the matter further in a more comprehensive review
[25]. Nesbet has in unpublished works responded to the our comment [18] as well as to that of
Holas and March [19].

The ﬁrst atomic DFT model was the Thomas-Fermi model, where the electron cloud is approx-
imated by a homogeneous electron gas. The energy is then a functional of the electron density,
ρ(r), which for non-interacting electrons becomes [26, 27, 28]

where

is the kinetic-energy functional and v(r) the local, external potential. Minimizing this functional
with respect to the electron density, leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation

TTF[ρ] =

dr [ρ(r)]5/3

Z

Z

δTTF
δρ(r)

+ v(r) = µ,

where µ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the normalization condition,

dr ρ(r) = N .

The original TF model is rather crude, and does, for instance, not give rise to any electronic
shell structure. The question raised by Nesbet in several articles [3, 9, 14] is whether there exists
’an exact Thomas-Fermi model’ for non-interacting electrons, which we interpret to imply that a
functional TTF[ρ] exists such that the energy functional (1) would be exact for such systems. Nesbet
claims that such a model would be in conﬂict with the exclusion principle – the TF equation (3)
with a single Lagrange multiplier could never lead to electronic shell structure, which requires one
parameter for each shell. In the Appendix we have derived the standard Hartree-Fock equations,
using a single Lagrange parameter, which invalidates the claim that additional parameters are
needed to generate shell structure.

R

Since the existence of an ’exact TF model’ is a direct consequence of the validity of the HK
theorem, Nesbet concludes that the fundamental HK theory is incomplete. For the same reason
the basic work of Englisch and Englisch [29, 30] as well as most of the current literature [31, 32,
33, 34, 35, 36, 37] is refuted.

There exists today an overwhelming amount of evidence for the validity of the locality hy-
pothesis in DFT, and it might seem superﬂuous to produce another piece. Since the matter is
still under debate in the literature, however, we shall here try to present simple arguments how
the conﬂict has arisen and how it can be resolved. We shall also present in our opinion strong
numerical evidence in favor of the hypothesis.

2 Functional derivatives

Generally, a density functional (F [ρ]) is deﬁned as a mapping of a normed space of densities1 (M )
on the space of real numbers (

) [38],

R

F [ρ] : M

,
→ R

a mapping that has to be unique in the sense that a certain density corresponds to a single real
number.

1The term ’normed space’ implies that all densities of the space have a deﬁnite, ﬁnite norm, such as ||ρ(r)|| =
dr |ρ(r)|, but the densities need not be normalized.

2.1 The Gˆateaux derivative

The Gˆateaux or weak diﬀerential of a density functional F [ρ] is deﬁned [38, p.46], [39, p.293], [37,

In principle, this diﬀerential depends on the direction δρ, and it need neither be linear nor contin-
uous in δρ. Generally, it can be expressed

2.2 The Fr´echet derivative

The Fr´echet or strong diﬀerential DF [ρ0, δρ] can be deﬁned [38, p.37], [39, p.292]

δF [ρ0, δρ] = F [ρ0 + δρ]

F [ρ0] = DF [ρ0, δρ] + ω(ρ0, δρ),

−

where

lim
||δρ||→0

ω(ρ0, δρ)

= 0.

||
Here, the limit has to be uniform in the neighborhood of the density ρ0, The Fr´echet diﬀerential can
also be expressed in the form (9) with the derivative in the form of a local potential function [38,
p.41].

||

The criterium for Fr´echet diﬀerentiability (12) is stronger than the corresponding Gˆateaux
criterium (7). If the Gˆateaux derivative exists in the neighborhood of a density and is uniformly
continuous in this neighborhood, then the Gˆateaux derivative at that density is also a Fr´echet
derivative [38, p.47], [39, p.295]. In DFT it is possible to stay within the normalization domain,
and then Gˆateaux diﬀerentiability is suﬃcient. If also densities outside this domain are considered,
Fr´echet diﬀerentiability is required.

In the next section we shall summarize the basics of the Kohn-Sham model as a background of
the locality analysis. (For further details regarding the basic theory, see, e.g., refs. [31, 32, 40, 37].)

The HK energy functional of a system with an external, local potential v(r) is

Z

and the energy, Ev0, and the electron density, ρ0(r), of the ground-state (or the lowest eigen-
state of certain symmetry [42]) are obtained by minimizing the energy functional over normalized
densities [32]

Ev0 = min
ρ→N

Ev[ρ] = Ev[ρ0].

As in our previous works [24, 25], we shall extend the deﬁnition of the HK functional (13) in
a straightforward way by allowing the wavefunctions to vary also outside the normalized domain
of the Sobolev space, which is needed in order to be able to apply the Euler-Lagrange procedure.
The minimization then leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation

δFHK[ρ]
δρ(r)

+ v(r) = µ,

where µ is the Lagrange parameter for the normalization constraint,

dr ρ(r) = N .

If we omit the electron-interaction part, ˆW , of the HK functional (13), then the EL equation
(17) is quite analogous to the Thomas-Fermi equation for non-interacting electrons (3). The kinetic
part, THK[ρ], of the HK functional (13) is then the kinetic-energy functional of the ’exact Thomas-
Fermi model’, which thus is a direct consequence of the HK theorem.

3.2 The Kohn-Sham model

electrons, moving in the local Kohn-Sham potential, vKS(r),

The two equations lead to the same solution, if – apart from a constant –

vKS(r) =

δρ(r) −

δTs[ρ]
δρ(r)

+ v(r).

If this potential were known, solving the KS equations self-consistently would yield, in principle,
the exact electron density and, if the HK functional (15) were known, the exact total energy of the
ground state – or the lowest state of a given symmetry. In addition, it has been shown that the
eigenvalue of the highest occupied KS orbital yields the exact ionization energy [43, 44, 45, 36].

A crucial point in the KS procedure is that the functionals involved are diﬀerentiable and that
the functional derivative is in the form of a local potential function. This is now a well-established
fact. In the standard DFT procedure, the variations are restricted to normalized densities, and
then Gˆateaux diﬀerentiability is suﬃcient. The Gˆateaux diﬀerentiability of the functional (13) was
rigorously demonstrated two decades ago by Englisch and Englisch [29, 30], based upon works of
Lieb [34], and the derivative was shown to be in the form of a local potential function.3 These
results have recently been carefully conﬁrmed by van Leeuwen [37]. By extending the deﬁnitions
of the density functionals involved to densities outside the normalization domain, as mentioned
above, we have demonstrated that the functionals are also Fr´echet diﬀerentiable [24, 25, 46].4

4 Nesbet’s locality dilemma and its solution

4.1 The problem

In his eﬀorts to demonstrate that standard DFT is in conﬂict with fundamental physics, Nesbet
considers the ground state – or lowest state of given symmetry – of a system of noninteracting
electrons. For a two-electron system this can be represented by a determinantal wavefunction
Φ(r1, r2), composed of spin-orbitals with the space part satisfying the single-electron Schr¨odinger
equation

φi(r) = εi φi(r)

valid for normalized orbitals. By making small orbital changes δφi, the kinetic energy of the ground
state is to leading order changed by (Eq. 9 in [9])

3The proof concerns the so-called Lieb functional, usually denoted FL[ρ], which in the case of nondegenerate

ground states we are concerned with here is identical to the functional (13).

4This holds for calculations with ﬁnite basis set, where the kinetic energy is ﬁnite, but it may not be rigorously

true when the number of dimensions is inﬁnite. (See ref. [25] for more detailed discussion).

dr δρi(r)

This is neither of the form (9) nor of the form (8) outside the domain of normalized orbitals (where
= 0) when the eigenvalues are diﬀerent. Therefore, dT cannot be a diﬀerential of a
density functional in this region, and no functional derivative exists, as we have demonstrated
R
before [24]. Instead, Nesbet introduces ’orbital-dependent’ derivatives

δT
δρi(r)

= εi −

v(r)

and interprets them as Gˆateaux derivatives, which is obviously neither in accordance with the
standard deﬁnition (9) above, nor with the extended deﬁnition (8).

In spite of the fact that T is not a density functional in the extended domain, Nesbet applies

the chain rule,

δT
δρi(r)

=

δT
δρ(r)

δρ(r)
δρi(r)

which together with the result (27) leads to a conﬂict with the TF equation (3), if the orbital
energies are diﬀerent,

ε1 6

= ε2 ⇒

δT
δρ1(r) 6
The reason for the conﬂict is that the kinetic-energy expression (24), which obviously is an or-
bital functional, is not a density functional outside the domain of normalized orbitals when the
eigenvalues are diﬀerent. Therefore, the chain rule (28) cannot be used in that region, and the
conﬂict is only apparent, as we have demonstrated before [24, 25] and emphasized also by Holas
and March [22]. We shall now indicate how this conﬂict can be resolved.

4.2 The solution

In the treatment of Nesbet the density variations are allowed to go outside the normalization
domain. At the same time it is emphasized that the kinetic-energy expression should be an orbital
as well as a density functional, which, of course, has to be the case in the extended domain.

The kinetic energy and the electron density are not a priori deﬁned outside the normalization
domain, and we have to choose a proper extension. A natural extension is simply to use the
standard expressions also outside the normalization [24, 25],

assuming the orbitals to be mutually orthogonal. Since the orbitals are not normalized, it is vital
to maintain the normalization integrals in the expression to be varied. Instead of the expression
(26), the diﬀerential of the kinetic energy due to orbital changes now becomes [24]

which is in accordance with the expression (9) also for variations outside the normalization. This
veriﬁes that the form (30) is a unique functional of the total density in the neighborhood of the
ground-state density, and it yields the derivative

(27)

(28)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

This is in contrast to the result of Nesbet (29) orbital independent. The derivative is the same in
all directions – also outside the normalization – and is of Fr´echet type.

We can now identify the constant in the derivative (33) with the Lagrange multiplier in the

’Thomas-Fermi’ equation (3),

.

Thus, there is only a single Lagrange parameter, when the extension to the unnormalized domain
is done in a consistent way, and the conﬂict (29) with the Thomas-Fermi equation is removed .

The crucial point in the arguments is the chain rule (28). The more exact form of this rule is

If we assume that the density is given by (25), then δρ(r′

which is equivalent to the simpliﬁed chain rule (28). But this holds only inside the normalization
domain, where the density can be written in the form (25). In the treatment of Nesbet, however,
the variations have to go outside this domain, otherwise the orbital dependence of the diﬀerential
(26) would vanish, and there would be no conﬂict.

4.3 Comments

The basic claim of Nesbet is that ’density functional derivatives of the Hohenberg-Kohn universal
functional cannot be equivalent to local potential functions, as assumed in established literature [31,
32], for more than two electrons in a compact electronic system’ [15], and it is concluded that ’the
TF theory is not equivalent to Kohn-Sham theory, even if the exact Hohenberg-Kohn universal
functional were known and used’ [3].

Reference is made to the ’well-known failure’ of Thomas-Fermi theory to describe the atomic
shell structure. This failure is unknown to us – unless, of course, it refers to the trivial case of the
original approximation (2) from the 1920’s. According to the HK theorem, an exact kinetic-energy
functional does exist (THK[ρ] in Eq.(13)), but to our knowledge, however, no approximation to the
functional beyond the original approximation has been constructed and tested.

A related question addressed by Nesbet is that the Euler-Lagrange equation, like the TF equa-
tion (3) or the HK equation (17), with a single Lagrange parameter, cannot lead to electronic
shell structure. In a recent paper [20] it is stated that ’the exclusion principle requires independent
normalization of the orbital partial densities’. Without such independent normalization Nesbet
claims that the electronic wavefunction will collapse to the lowest single-electron state.

In the Appendix we have given an elementary counterargument by deriving the standard
Hartree-Fock equations for a two-electron system with a single parameter for the normalization of
the total wave function. This obviously leads to shell structure, and there is no collapse into the
lowest electronic state [18]. Parameters for normalization of individual shells are not needed, if
orbital overlap integrals are included in the expression to be minimized.

7

The standard way of deriving the HF equations is, of course, to introduce Lagrange multipli-
ers for the orthonormality condition. Here, however, we want to emphasize that there exist two
equivalent ways of performing a minimization by means of orbital variations, either by enforcing
orthonormality by means of Lagrange multipliers, omitting orbital normalization and overlap inte-
grals, or by maintaining these integrals together with a single Lagrange parameter for the overall
normalization (and performing the orthonormalization afterwards, if desired). In our DFT work
we used the latter method.

The reason for the failure of standard DFT is according to Nesbet that the treatment is re-
stricted to normalized densities [15, 16]. The Euler-Lagrange procedure requires the functional to
be deﬁned also in inﬁnitesimal neighborhoods of such densities. This is regarded as ’a crucial lim-
itation of the Hohenberg-Kohn theory.’ It is assumed that the normalization constraint ’hides’ the
additional parameters needed to generate shell structure. The conclusion is that a correct theory
can only be developed using functional derivatives of orbital densities with nonlocal potentials.

We have shown [24, 25] that restricting the treatment to normalized densities constitutes no
limitation. Extending the treatment to the unnormalized domain leads to identical results – no
’hidden’ parameters are uncovered.

That DFT is complete without any additional parameters has also been demonstrated among
others by Perdew and Levy [36], who emphasize that ’the exact functionals themselves (and not
extraneous constraints) are responsible for the shell structure’.

Our analysis reconﬁrms the well-established result that DFT with local potential is inherently
exact. The same conclusion, using diﬀerent lines of arguments, is reached by Holas and March in
their recent analysis [23].

5 Numerical demonstration of locality

As a further demonstration of the validity of the locality hypothesis, we have, using the method
of Baerends and van Leeuwen [47], constructed numerically the local Kohn-Sham potential for the
1s2s 3S state of neutral helium – a state often used by Nesbet to demonstrate the break-down of this
principle. Our starting point is the density generated by an accurate many-body wavefunction,
obtained by means of our all-order pair procedure [48]. The potential is constructed so that
the Kohn-Sham orbitals generate the many-body density very accurately, and then the energy
eigenvalue of the 2s Kohn-Sham orbital agrees with the many-body ionization energy within our
numerical accuracy of nine digits [49]. This result veriﬁes that a single local potential can generate
essentially exact results, also for electrons with diﬀerent energy eigenvalues, and that there is no
conﬂict between the locality hypothesis and the exclusion principle, as claimed by Nesbet. Related
results (with less numerical accuracy) have been obtained by many groups in the past [44, 50, 51,
52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]. In addition to verifying the locality hypothesis, our result represents another
numerical veriﬁcation of the theorem regarding the highest occupied Kohn-Sham eigenvalue [43,
44, 45, 36, 58].

We have obtained similar result with the Hartree-Fock density, which also can be reproduced
by a local Kohn-Sham potential. The eigenvalue of the KS 2s orbital then agrees with the HF
value with high accuracy. This demonstrates that it is possible to represent exchange – in the DFT
sense – by a local potential.

The latter result is in sharp contrast to the conclusions drawn, for instance, by Nesbet and
Colle [4, 6, 11, 14], who conclude that the Kohn-Sham model with a local potential can never be
exact and, in particular, that a local potential can never be better than the optimized-potential
method of Talman and Shadwick [59]. This potential in turn yields higher ground-state energy
than the Hartree-Fock model, as measured by the expectation value of the Hamiltonian,
, and
i
this is supposed to conﬁrm the failure of the locality hypothesis for exchange. A comparison of
this kind is, of course, of no value, since the energy in DFT is given by the HK energy functional

H

– not by

the nonlocal exchange.

. Needless to say, though, that a local potential can never in all respects reproduce
i

Our results provide counterexamples to Nesbet’s conclusions drawn in several papers [14, 16]
that a correct theory can only be developed using orbital -functional theory with non-local poten-
tials. We have demonstrated that density-functional theory with local potential is exact – but, of
course, not identical to orbital-functional theory with non-local potential.

In summary, we have reconﬁrmed that the locality hypothesis is an exact statement. The conﬂict
with the exclusion principle, claimed by Nesbet, is only apparent and is eliminated by using ex-
pressions that are density functionals also outside the orbital normalization. Our conclusion is
supported by accurate numerical results.

Appendix: Fermi-Dirac Statistics with a single Lagrange Mul-
tiplier

In this appendix we want to demonstrate in an elementary way that it is possible to satisfy
the conditions for Fermi-Dirac statistics in a variational procedure with only a single Lagrange
multiplier. We shall do that by minimizing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian
Ψ
i
|
under the condition that the total wavefunction Ψ is normalized,
= 1, and show that this
leads to the standard Hartree-Fock equations. No additional parameters are needed. Fermi-Dirac
statistics is enforced by demanding that the two-electron wavefunction is antisymmetric.

Generally, the solution of the problem is found by demanding that

is stationary with E is being the Lagrange multiplier for the normalization of Ψ. This leads to the
Schr¨odinger equation

We consider now a two-electron system in a state where the electrons are in diﬀerent orbitals,
such as the lowest triplet state, 1s2s 3S. The antisymmetric wavefunction can be expressed in
terms of spin-orbitals φa and φb,

The hamiltonian ˆH is here

φa(1)φb(2)

Although the normalized two-electron wave function is unique, the orbitals are not. They
need not be individually normalized and/or orthogonal. If we have found orbitals that satisfy the
equations above, however, we can easily transform them to become orthonormal without changing
the two-electron wavefunction. We can thus replace the two-electron normalization constraint with
the one-electron orthonormality constraints without loss of generality. We can then simplify the
equations (42a), (42b) to

Abstract

A procedure to calculate the radiation spectrum emitted by an arbitrarily prepared
Dirac wave packet is developed. It is based on the Dirac charge current and classical
electrodynamic theory. Apart from giving absolute intensity values, it is exact in
terms of relativistic retardation eﬀects and angular dependence. We employ a laser
driven free electron to demonstrate the advantages of our method as compared to
traditional ones that merely rely on the Fourier transform of the dipole operator’s
expectation value. Classical reference calculations conﬁrm the results obtained for
the low-frequency part of the spectrum, especially in terms of the observed red-shifts,
which clearly deviate from non-relativistic calculations. In the high-frequency part
of the spectrum, we note appreciable deviations to the purely classical calculations
which may be linked to quantum averaging eﬀects.

1 Introduction

The appearance of harmonics in the light scattered at free electrons is known
both in theory [1, 2, 3, 4] as well as in experiments [5, 6, 7] for a rather long
time now. Atomic systems [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] in highly intense laser ﬁelds have
turned out to produce especially high orders, the so-called High Harmonics
[14, 15, 16]. In this case, the experimentally observed spectra [17, 18, 19] are

usually explained in terms of the so-called recollision model [20]. Therefore,
in the context of quantum mechanical simulations such as those shown in
[21, 22, 23], apart from the obvious observables such as the expectation value
of the position or momentum operator and the spatial probability density
distribution, there is a lot of interest in calculating the radiation spectrum as
well.

The numerical methods that were described in our previous work [22] pro-
vide the Dirac wave function as a function of time and position, where both
variables are discretized and limited to certain regions. There exists a well-
established procedure [24] that derives the emission spectrum from such a
given data set (e.g. [12, 25]). However, this one was developed for the non-
relativistic Schr¨odinger theory, and contains further approximations. The ques-
tion arises whether, in the highly relativistic regime, where non-relativistic
quantum theory breaks down, it is still advisable to employ a partly non-
relativistic method for the calculation of the quantum emission spectrum.

In this paper, we present a procedure that takes into account all relativistic
spectral eﬀects. It is based on the Dirac charge current and the classical theory
of electromagnetism. Apart from giving absolute intensity values, it is exact
in terms of relativistic retardation eﬀects and angular dependence. To take
advantage of the new scheme, one needs to obtain the time-resolved Dirac
wave function of some physically interesting scenario in the ﬁrst place. We
made use of our advanced two-dimensional Dirac split-operator code [22] and
considered the motion of a free electron in a laser ﬁeld [26] to put the new
scheme to the test. Classical calculations, which should not deviate much from
the quantum calculations for this particular case as far as the lower part of
the spectrum is concerned, serve as a reference and prove the correctness of
the new scheme. However, signiﬁcant deviations from the established method
[24] are revealed. In addition to that, the higher order harmonics are averaged
out. The delocalized quantum charge distribution is likely to be responsible
for this eﬀect.

This remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 brieﬂy reviews
the formulas required to evaluate the radiation spectrum of a classical point
charge and their non-relativistic limit. Section 3 brieﬂy discusses the estab-
lished standard methods, then turns to the derivation of our new method. In
the end, the non-relativistic limit of the latter is evaluated to show that it
matches the former. This section also discusses the solution of some numerical
problems that are involved. Section 4 discusses the results obtained with our
method and relates them to those obtained with the standard methods and
classical formulas. We draw our conclusions in section 5 and provide the clas-
sical equations of motion in appendix A and the Dirac equation in appendix
B, as well as some remarks and references concerning the way that we solved
both problems numerically.

2 Classical radiation spectrum

The physical quantity of interest here is the diﬀerential amount of energy
(d2W ) emitted into a certain interval of frequency (dω) and solid angle (dΩ),
i.e. the quantity d2W
dωdΩ .

2.1 Spectrum of a charged classical point particle in relativistic motion

From [27] we obtain a formula for the far-ﬁeld radiation of a classical charged
point particle which is ready for application:

3 Quantum mechanical treatment

The usual way (e.g. [12, 25]) to calculate the emission spectrum is the follow-
ing: Starting from the classical non-relativistic formula (4) the spectrum for
a quantum mechanical system is evaluated using the corresponding quantity
that is based on the acceleration expectation value

For a more precise derivation and in addition to that a detailed discussion of
the role of the “coherent” part (see above) and the “incoherent” part (not dis-
cussed here) of the spectrum, see [28, 29]. The next step [24] is the application
of the Ehrenfest theorem, i.e. the replacement

which is easy to evaluate if the magnetic ﬁeld ~B is neglected (the so-called
dipole approximation). However, it is the magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects and the for-
ward drift caused by them which have to be taken care of in this work with
an emphasis on relativistic velocities. This precludes equation (4) from be-
ing the basis of any highly-relativistic theory. In a weakly-relativistic work
such as [30], the starting point remains equation (4), however, the relativis-
tically correct equation (A.3) is employed instead of equation (6). Utilising
several essential approximations, the authors obtain an expression that can
be evaluated numerically. Those approximations are no longer valid in the
more strongly relativistic cases considered here, where even for classical calcu-
lations, the substitution of equation (1) by (4) can already lead to noticeable
frequency shifts in the spectrum.

Unfortunately, in a quantum mechanical context, equation (4) is not easily
replaced by the relativistically correct variant (1) and a calculation of the

4

required expectation values in the framework of the Dirac theory. On the
one hand there are fundamental reasons, such as the diﬃculty to deﬁne a
reasonable velocity operator in the Dirac theory 1 , on the other hand one
needs to take into account certain practical considerations 2 . Therefore we
have dropped all corresponding considerations in favour of the following far
more promising idea.

We start by calculating the emission spectrum of a spatially distributed clas-
sical charge current, instead of the one of a point charge. The following deriva-
tion diﬀers slightly from those found in the literature [27] in that the one and
only approximation made is the far-ﬁeld expression for the electric ﬁeld of a
charge current. Otherwise it is exact. The transition to quantum mechanics
is carried out at the very end of the calculation by substituting a suitable
expression for the charge current.

Changes according to (27) have to be applied to all equations (21) to (24), of
course. The following explanation is meant to improve the readers intuitive
understanding of the above purely mathematical description: If we designate
the edge of volume V that lies furthest away from a given, ﬁxed observer
by the label a) and the other, closest edge by b), as shown in Figure 1, then
obviously the time that the radiation needs to travel from a) to the observer is
longer than from b). The simulation starts at r′
0. One would be inclined
to activate the detector at t0 = t′
0 + [travel time b) to the detector] and to
close it at t1 = t′
1 + [travel time from a) to detector] in order to avoid letting
any radiation go by undetected. However, for consistency, then one would also
have to take into account any radiation that reaches the detector at time t0
as deﬁned before, but which originates from position a) at a time before the
beginning of our actual calculation, and about which therefore, no information
is available. Thus, our conservative approach is to open the detector a little
bit later. The choice t0 = t′
0 +[travel time from a) to the detector] throws away
some radiation of origin b), but now everything that is detected is properly
taken care of. Similarly, at time t1 as deﬁned above there would be a lack of
any information about radiation that is coming from b) and superimposing
the radiation that is still arriving from a). Therefore, the conservative choice
t1 = t′
1 + [travel time from b) to the detector] has to be made here, too.
Considering equation (28), one easily notices that the detection interval can
become rather short for large values of R. Thus, a spatially extended motion
can only be analyzed if it is slow, or more exactly speaking, if t′
1 are
widely separated in time. At least for a particle initially at rest, t′
0 can be
moved into the past as much as required without altering R, whenever this is
not the case.

3.2 Application to quantum mechanics

In relativistic quantum mechanics, the probability current density is given in
the following way [32]

jµ
prob = cψ†γ0γµψ, where γ0 = β and ~γ = β~α,

(29)

and can be easily decomposed into the vectorial current density

and the scalar density

For the charge current ~ in the context of Dirac theory, we choose

~prob = cψ†~αψ

ρprob = ψ†ψ.

~ = q ~prob = qc ψ†~αψ

Finally, insert equation (41) (apart from the factor ~δ(0), which has to be
omitted, cf. appendix B) into (40) and the result into (36). Together with
(37), (38) and (39) this would give (for the case h = 1) the ﬁnal formula used
in our code. Because of its size, we do not print it again.

3.4 Numerical limitations

Tests showed that the derivative of the current as shown before in equations
(40) and (41), although correct in theory, cannot be numerically calculated
correctly this way. Apparently, the reason is to be found in equation (34):
This equation is only true, if ψ is a exact solution of the Dirac equation.
Small errors in, for example, the phase of the wave function can have a large
inﬂuence on the result. However, the current (32) itself is independent of the
phase. Therefore, a less elegant, but numerically superior method is a ﬁnite
diﬀerence scheme like the following:

∂
∂t

~ =

~ (t + ∆t)
∆t

−

~ (t)

where

~ (t)

(32)
= qc ψ(t)†~αψ(t)

(42)

A higher order scheme would be desirable, however this would require a rather
impracticable multiple storage of the wave function. Fortunately, ∆t has to be
chosen only small enough as to let ωmax = π
∆t cover the whole spectral range
that is to be expected. It can therefore be much larger than the step size of
the numerical propagation of ψ.

3.5 Non-relativistic limit

Just to gain some trust into the above derivation, we now look at its non-
relativistic and spin-less limit. It can be obtained by ignoring small retardation

If we expand the integration interval to inﬁnity, as indicated above, and re-

place ~a⊥ ↔ h
i⊥, then we recover the classical result (4) in (50). It returns
the spectrum as proportional to the Fourier transform of the perpendicular
component of the mean acceleration. 5 If however, we neglect the retardation

[24]. 6

4 Spectra of free electrons in a laser ﬁeld

In order to appreciate the work carried out in section 3, we have made a com-
parative study of ﬁve diﬀerent methods. In this study, the physical parameters
are primarily chosen in order to magnify the diﬀerences in the spectra and to
speed up calculations.

The scenario is the following one: A free electronic wave packet is propagated
over 20 cycles, two of which are dedicated to the ﬁeld amplitude’s sin2-shaped
turn-on and turn-oﬀ phase, respectively. In order to see a reasonable number
of harmonics in the spectrum of an otherwise free electron [1], such a large
number of cycles is necessary. A free electron is favourable to the numerics:
There are, at least in polarization direction, no large canonical momentum
components, and the wave packet is not torn apart by scattering in addition to
its unavoidable natural spreading. Therefore, it is possible to use small grids
of rather low spatial resolution. The large number of cycles implies a high
frequency in order to keep the overall propagation time short. Note that the
time resolution for Dirac calculations is almost independent of the problem 7
and only given by ∆t . ~
~
mc2 . Therefore the frequency was chosen as
ω = 7.120 a.u. (corresponding to 6.4 nm). 8 In order to stay in the strongly
relativistic regime – it is only here that we can expect appreciable diﬀerences
– the intensity has to be set to the challenging value E0 = 300 a.u. (I =
3.15

1021 W/cm2). The following calculations were carried out:

E ≈

×

5 Note that most authors ignore the correct prefactor and give the spectrum in
“arbitrary units” only.
6 The authors of [24] employ the length gauge ~E(t) =
and the dipole approximation ~A = ~0.
7 Extremely high kinetic energies in the MeV regime are an exception to this rule,
see [23]. They require an even higher temporal resolution since E = γmc2 and γ > 1.
8 This particular frequency is the highest one that is indicated for the future FEL
of the so-called ,,TESLA-Test-Facility (Phase 2)” at DESY in Hamburg [34].

From these data sets, the following spectra were produced:

labelled “classical theory (approx.)”.

In both cases we used the same (relativistically correct) trajectory data set,
i.e. the distinction relativistic vs. non-relativistic only refers to the way that
the spectrum is evaluated.

•

From the single data set according to the Dirac theory, two diﬀerent kinds
of spectra were extracted:

·

·

the fully relativistic one (“Dirac”) according to the method presented in
subsections 3.1 to 3.4: It contains no non-relativistic approximations and
takes into account all retardation and spin eﬀects.
a half-relativistic one (“Dirac-Schr¨odinger”): the expectation value of the
electric ﬁeld was evaluated from the density distribution, and then, ac-
cording to the procedure in subsection 3.5, the spectrum was calculated.
In other words, the relativistically correct Dirac probability density was
fed into a non-relativistic procedure, which was originally developed for
the Schr¨odinger probability density. Spin eﬀects are taken care of for the
propagation, but not for the spectrum calculation, i.e. for the charge cur-
rent.

•

From Schr¨odinger data set (“Schr¨odinger”), the spectrum was evaluated
according to the method in subsection 3.5. This represents an entirely non-
relativistic version, with no spin eﬀects at all.

Additionally, the observation angle ϑ is varied from 0◦ to 90◦ in steps of
30◦. The “Dirac-Schr¨odinger” method allows us to diﬀerentiate between ef-
fects caused by diﬀerent wave function propagation methods and those that
originate from the diﬀerent treatment of the emitted radiation.

14

4.1 Comparison of the results

We point out the following features of the spectrum that was calculated using
the Dirac charge current in Figure 2 and the magniﬁcation thereof in Figure 3:
For ϑ = 0◦, there are only harmonics of ﬁrst, third and ﬁfth order. Third
and ﬁfth order are very weak and hard to distinguish from the oscillating
underground. No red shift is found. At ϑ = 30◦, there are more harmonic
orders: Up to the seventh order both even and odd harmonics can be seen,
and a small red shift is found. This eﬀect is enlarged for ϑ = 60◦. For ϑ =
90◦ we ﬁnd the largest red shift and harmonics of up to ninth order. The
intensity of the fundamental line decreases to a level even below the one of the
second to fourth order harmonics. The underground intensity also decreases.
The underlying reasons are best understood by looking at the similar, but
more intuitive classical picture. Looking at the spectrum in Figure 4 and its
magniﬁed version Figure 5, which are based upon the classical trajectory and
the corresponding relativistically correct radiation formula, we notice that for
ϑ = 0◦ there are only odd harmonics, but both even and odd ones up to about
19th order for all other angles. For order above 20, the peaks disappear in
the noise. There is no red shift at ϑ = 0◦, but an increasing one for larger
angles. At ϑ = 90◦, the intensity of the fundamental line drops below the one
of the second to ﬁfth order harmonic. The similarities between this classical
calculation and the Dirac based one are obvious. The main diﬀerence is that
due to the smeared out charge distribution in the quantum mechanical Dirac
calculation, some sharp structures of the classical spectrum are averaged out,
especially its higher frequency part.

The growth of the red shift with increasing angle can be understood qualita-
tively quite easily (cf. [9]): In the rest frame of the electron, the laser frequency
is red shifted because of the forward drift of the electron in the laser ﬁeld, and
the same is true for the oscillation frequency of the electron in polarization
direction due to the laser’s electric ﬁeld component. If the electron drift is
directed exactly towards the observer (ϑ = 0◦), the latter sees this actually
red-shifted frequency in the electron’s radiation, which however is Doppler-
shifted back to exactly its original position in the frequency domain. If the
observation angle is larger (ϑ > 0◦), the original red shift stays the same, but
the compensating Doppler blue-shift decreases with increasing angle, leaving
behind an increasing net red shift.

The appearance of even and odd harmonics can be understood by the means
of a symmetry consideration. One needs to consider the approximative for-
mula (4), i.e. the magnitude squared of the Fourier transform of the acceler-

ation component ~a⊥ perpendicular to the direction of observation. Reference
[4] provides the classical analytical solution for the particle velocity ~β(η) in
terms of the laser phase η. If we insert a simple harmonic cw-laser ﬁeld in
those formulas and take the time derivative, we obtain for the acceleration
something like

~a = c

~β(η) = u(η)~σ1 + g(η)~σ2

∂
∂t

(51)

where u(η) is a rather complicated function, with odd symmetry with respect
to both η = 0 und η = π
2 , whereas g(η) features even symmetry with respect
to η = 0 and odd symmetry with respect to η = π
2 . In the above, ~σ1 and ~σ2
are unit vectors in propagation and polarization direction, respectively. The
properties of the Fourier transform then automatically lead to even harmonics
for the ~σ1-component of acceleration and odd ones for its ~σ2-component. The
latter ones are exclusively visible for the observation direction designated by
ϑ = 0◦, and only the former ones for ϑ = 90◦. At any angle in between, one
would expect the appropriate mixture of both even and odd harmonic orders.
The above analytical discussion explains the complete disappearance of even
orders in the numerical calculations for ϑ = 0◦ just as well as the suppression
of the fundamental (which is odd by itself) at ϑ = 90◦. All deviations from
the mathematically ideal behaviour have to be attributed to the relativistic
corrections, the retardation r
= 0 and last but not least the usage of
a time-limited, pulse-shaped laser pulse.

·

Summing up the above, we can say that the classical and the quantum me-
chanical description are in good agreement and both deliver well understood
spectra. One might therefore ask immediately for the motivation of the com-
putationally expensive Dirac calculations. In fact, this particular scenario was
set up mainly because we wanted to verify the correctness of the procedure
described in subsections 3.1 to 3.4 using a system from which one would not
expect large quantum eﬀects, so any deviations from the well-known classical
behaviour would easily reveals errors in the method or the code. The agree-
ment between classical and quantum theory is likely to disappear however
for laser-driven bound systems. The parameter regime usually referred to as
“tunnelling regime”, for which a description of the “High Harmonic Genera-
tion” process according to the recollision model [20] is applicable, would be
of high interest. Unfortunately, this regime is characterized by low frequen-
cies and therefore long computational runtimes, which renders it impossible
to study with our Dirac code, at least when simultaneously employing ﬁeld
strengths that are large enough to render relativistic and spin-related eﬀects
visible. Low intensities would be feasible, but not very interesting, as there are
already a number of completely suﬃcient Schr¨odinger [12] and Pauli [25, 30]
calculations for this regime.

However, we note some interesting discrepancies when we compare the method
from subsections 3.1 to 3.4 and the ordinary procedure as shown in subsec-
tion 3.5. The latter, or more exactly equation (48), can, although originally
deduced from Schr¨odinger theory, also be evaluated using the Dirac probability
density: This is achieved by Fourier transforming the perpendicular acceler-
ation component ~a⊥ as in equation (50), where the acceleration is taken as
~E(~x, t) with respect to the Dirac wave function.
the expectation value of
As an example, this is shown in Figure 6 for an observation angle ϑ = 30◦
and enlarged in Figure 7 (second graph from top to bottom in both ﬁgures)
side by side with the exact Dirac procedure, the also exact classical method
according to equation (1) and its non-relativistic approximation (4), as well as
the non-relativistic Schr¨odinger calculation 10 , which is also based upon equa-
tion (50), but is derived from a non-relativistic Schr¨odinger wave function. As
one can see, the three not entirely relativistic methods (“Dirac-Schr¨odinger”,
“classical theory (approx.)”, and “Schr¨odinger”) signiﬁcantly over-estimate
the red shift 11 , because in these calculations, the Doppler eﬀect due to the
electron’s drift in propagation direction is not included. The even harmonics,
which should be visible for any non-zero observation angle, are missing in both
spectra according to equation (50) (“Dirac-Schr¨odinger” and “Schr¨odinger”).
This is because only the perpendicular component of the electric ﬁeld is taken
into account, weighted either with the Dirac or the Schr¨odinger probability
density. As a result, the spectrum features a simple cos(ϑ)-dependence and
90◦. There is no change in structure with varying angle,
even vanishes for ϑ
it has always the shape of the version for ϑ = 0◦, although it is only valid for
this particular angle.

→

Apart from the methodical diﬀerences laid out above, we also see diﬀerences
between the two classical calculations and all three quantum mechanical ones.
Especially the higher order harmonic peaks that are visible in the classical
curves are averaged out in the case of the quantum spectra.

10 Note: The Schr¨odinger calculation only seems to exhibit far less noise than all
the other calculations. The reason is that it was carried out using a much coarser
frequency resolution (about one ﬁfth). Apart from that, its prefactor is not known.
To indicate this, the vertical scale in the corresponding plots was omitted.
11 Note: These three methods even predict a red shift at ϑ = 0◦, which is not shown
here.

17

5 Conclusions

From the above, it can be concluded that the procedure laid out in detail
in subsections 3.1 to 3.4 is superior to the established techniques in terms of
angle dependence of especially the even harmonic orders, and in terms of the
predicted red shifts, whenever the parameters are chosen in a way that leads
to a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of retardation and magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects. In principal,
even spin eﬀects 12 could be analyzed this way, since the method is based on
the Dirac theory. Although originally developed for the usage in combination
with Dirac wave functions, the method could be employed in the context of
the Schr¨odinger or Pauli theory as well 13 , if one abandoned the Ehrenfest
theorem and evaluated equation (44) directly, and it would at least correct
the angle dependence. Employing equation (20) would even lead to correct
red shifts, and the only remaining quantitative deviations would be due to
the underlying non-relativistic wave packet propagation. The computational
cost for the spectrum alone is not essentially higher than for the more sim-
ple schemes, therefore its general usage can be recommended. However, the
parameter regime in which its advantages are best visible are already very
demanding as far as the wave packet propagation is concerned.

For the free electron scenario, classical results are very similar to the ones ob-
tained with our new method. We see no true quantum eﬀects apart from the
disappearance of the higher order harmonics. This may be attributed to aver-
aging eﬀects by the spatially extended Dirac charge current. More signiﬁcant
eﬀects are very likely to be observed once that atomic systems are considered.
It must be noted, though, that our main goal was to devise a relativistically
correct scheme, as opposed to the non-relativistic existing ones. Our results
show that the relativistic corrections are signiﬁcant for the parameters em-
ployed here.

12 We have chosen an initial state that has spin up with respect to the magnetic
ﬁeld direction ~σ3, but did not analyze the inﬂuence of variations of the initial spin
polarization on the spectrum. Spin eﬀects such as those studied in [35] would even
require three-dimensional calculations.

~f(~x,~v,t) = q ~E(~x,t) +

q

~v

×

~B(~x,t).

Equation (A.1), which represents a second-order diﬀerential equation with
respect to the three-dimensional position variable ~x can be easily transformed
[10] into a ﬁrst-order system of diﬀerential equations in terms of the six-
dimensional combined variable (~x, ~v):

~v =

~x = ~v

Formally, the above means

(~x, ~v) = G(~x,~v,t)

where G(~x,~v,t) represents the six-dimensional function that is obtained from the
right hand side of equations (A.3) and (A.4) after inserting the force (A.2).
The ﬁrst-order system (A.5) is then easily numerically integrated by means of
a standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm [36].

B The Dirac equation

The Dirac equation in 3 + 1 dimensions reads as follows:

i~ ∂ψ
∂t

= c~α

~

~
∇ −

~A

q
c

!

·  

i

ψ + βmc2ψ + qA0ψ.

(B.1)

In the above, ~ is Planck’s constant, q and m represent the particle’s charge
and rest mass, c is the speed of light, αi and β are the usual Dirac matrices
(i = 1, 2, 3) [32]. We use atomic units, so for an electron ~ = m =
q = 1 a.u.,

−

19

and c = 137.036 a.u. Suppose we have a potential that is invariant under
translations in one particular direction that is designated by ~n

A0 = A0(~x⊥),

~A = ~A(~x⊥), where ~x⊥ = ~n

(~x

~n),

×

×

(B.2)

then we can use the separation ansatz

ψ(~x) = ψ′(~x⊥)χ(xk) and χ(xk) =

in the Dirac equation (B.1). The result is:

1
√2π

exp

i
~ p0

kxk

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

, where xk = ~n

~x

·
(B.3)

i~ ∂ψ′
∂t

~

= c~α

~
∇⊥ + p0
k~n

−

· 

i

~A

q
c

!

ψ′+βmc2ψ′+qA0ψ′, where ~

∇⊥ = ~n
×

(~
∇×

~n).

(B.4)
In general, there will not be a single momentum p0
k, but rather a momentum
R and the solution is a
distribution giving speciﬁc weights for arbitrary pk ∈
wave packet instead of (B.3). We restrict ourselves to the simple choice p0
k = 0
to eliminate this constant. Other values would not provide more physical in-
sight, and true wave packet calculations would cause the computing times to
grow into the regime of true three-dimensional calculations. Note however,
that the ansatz (B.3) inevitably leads to a meaningless factor ~δ(0) in bilinear
expressions of ψ, such as expectation values or the integrated current density.

We ﬁnally obtain an eﬀective Dirac equation in two dimensions:

i~ ∂ψ′
∂t

= c~α

~

~
∇⊥ −

~A

q
c

!

·  

i

ψ′ + βmc2ψ′ + qA0ψ′

(B.5)

The above equation is integrated [37] using the split-operator scheme [38]
presented in our earlier work [22]. The dynamical grid techniques described in
there are especially well-suited for the free electron problem discussed here,
and dramatically reduce computation times.

A vector potential that describes a laser beam of electric ﬁeld amplitude E0
and frequency ω, which is linearly polarized in direction ˆa and propagates in
direction of the wave vector ~k, such as

~A =

c
ω

ˆa
−

E0 sin (ωt

~x), A0 = 0,

~k

−

·

(B.6)

is invariant in direction ~n Def.= ˆk
ˆa. As can be easily seen, in this context “two-
dimensional” does not mean that there is no magnetic ﬁeld ~B (which points in
the xk-direction). Also note that the above two-dimensional treatment is exact
for the special case of a free electron in a laser ﬁeld that we considered in this
paper, because the vector potential (B.6) features the required symmetry.

Fig. 6. Comparison of several methods to evaluate the radiation spectrum: The
top graph is based on the method from subsections 3.1 to 3.4 and shows the fully
relativistic spectrum due to a two-dimensional Dirac charge current. The second
graph from top to bottom displays the spectrum obtained by Fourier transforming
the perpendicular acceleration component ~a⊥, where the acceleration is taken as
~E(~x, t) with respect to the Dirac wave function, similar
the expectation value of q
m
to the way shown in subsection 3.5 for a Schr¨odinger wave function. The third
graph shows the fully relativistic spectrum calculated for the classical trajectory
according to subsection 2.1, and the fourth graph the one that can be obtained from
the same trajectory data in the non-relativistic limit according to subsection 2.2.
The bottom graph displays the result according to the method in subsection 3.5
for a non-relativistic Schr¨odinger calculation. No vertical scale is given for this last
calculation, which is a contribution of Andreas Staudt, because the prefactor is not
known.

Fig. 7. Enlarged view of Figure 6: The diﬀerences of the distinct methods in terms of
red shift and harmonic orders are obvious. All methods that contain non-relativistic
elements (Dirac-Schr¨odinger, approx. classical theory and Schr¨odinger) feature sig-
niﬁcant red shifts at the observation angle displayed here (30◦). For the exact classi-
cal and the Dirac-calculation noticeable red shifts only occur for much larger angles.
Apart from that, even harmonic orders are missing in both the Dirac-Schr¨odinger
and the Schr¨odinger calculation. The latter only seems to have less numerical noise
than all the others, but this is due to a coarser frequency resolution.

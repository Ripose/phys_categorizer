It is known many examples when the excitation or ionization of atoms occurs as

result of the action of sudden perturbations. First of all these are atomic excitation

or ionization in the nuclear reactions [1,2]. For example in β-decay of nucleus, when

the fast β-electron’s escape is perceived by atomic electrons as a sudden changing of

nuclear charge or in neutron impact with nucleus, when the sudden of momentum

transfer to the nucleus occurs etc.

The sudden approximation [3] can be used for consideration multielectron transi-

tion in complex atoms, when transition occurring in internal shells, are perceived by

relatively slow electrons of external shells as instantaneous (see [4,5]). As a result of

action of sudden perturbation can be considered inelastic processes in the collisions

of fast multicharged ions with atoms [6 - 12] and in the collisions of charged parti-

cles with highly-excited atoms [13]. After action of sudden perturbation, the excited

atom can relax with radiation of photons belonging to known spectrum of isolated

atom. However, if sudden perturbation causes the change of velocities of atomic

electrons, atom can radiate during the action of perturbation. Classical analogue

of such a problem is the [14] radiation of a free electron under the sudden changing

of velocity. Thus, it is necessary to state a general problem on the spectrum of

photons emitted by atom during the time of action of sudden perturbation, i.e. - on

the spectrum of photons emitted simultaneously by all atomic electrons as a result

of action of perturbation.

In many practically important cases perturbation is not suﬃciently small to use a

perturbation theory. However the situations when the time of action of perturbation

is considerably less than the characteristic atomic time that enables one to solve the

problem without restricting the value of perturbation [9,15-17].

In this paper we derive a general expression for the spectrum of photons emitted

by the atom under sudden perturbation and apply this result to some concrete

processes.

Consider ”collision” type sudden perturbation [3], when the perturbation V (t) ≡
V (ra, t) , where ra - coordinates of atomic electrons, acts only during the time τ ,

which is much smaller than the characteristic period of unperturbed atom, describing

by Hamiltonian H0. To be deﬁnite we will assume that V (t) is not equal zero near

t = 0 only. Then in the exact solution of Schr¨odinger equation ( atomic units are

used throughout in this paper)

i

∂ψ
∂t

= (H0 + V (t))ψ

one can neglect by evolution of ψ (during the time τ ) caused by unperturbed Hamil-

tonian H0. Therefore the transition amplitude of atom from the initial state ϕ0 to

a ﬁnal state ϕn, as a result of actions of sudden perturbation V (t), has the form [3]:

+∞

Z−∞
a0n = hϕn | exp(−i

V (t)dt) | ϕ0i,

(1)

where ϕ0 and ϕn belong to the full set of orthonormalized eigenfunctions of the

unperturbated Hamiltonian H0, i.e. H0ϕn = ǫnϕn.

Thus in the sudden perturbation approximation the evolution of the initial state

has the form

t

Z−∞
ψ0(t) = exp(−i

V (t′)dt′)ϕ0,

where ψ0(t) satisﬁes the equation

i

∂ψ0(t)

∂t

= V (t)ψ0(t),

(3)

ψ0(t) → ϕ0 under t → −∞. Let’s introduce full and orthonormal set of functions

Φn(t) = exp(i

+∞

V (t′)dt′)ϕn,

Zt

(4)

obeying eq. (3), and Φn(t) → ϕn t → +∞. Obviously the amplitude (1) can be
rewritten as

a0n = hΦn(t) | ψ0(t)i.

Therefore the radiation amplitude can be calculated in the ﬁrst order of per-

turbation theory (as a corrections to the states (2) and (4)) over the interaction of

atomic electrons with electromagnetic ﬁeld [18,19].

Thus we have obtained the radiation spectrum of atom during the time of sudden

perturbation V (t).

As an application we consider the radiation spectrum of atom in the sudden

transmission of momentum p to the atomic electrons when V (t) has the form

equal to electron’s one and with charge Za, moving in the ﬁeld of homogeneous

forces f(t). This gives us the information about the value of the spectrum (9). Since
f(t) 6= 0 just during the time τ , and the spectrum (9) is proportional to | ˜f(ω) |2,
only the photons belonging to continuum with characteristic frequencies ω ≤ 1/τ
can be emitted by atom.

Analogously one can consider the radiation of atom in the ”switching” type

sudden perturbation (we use the classiﬁcation of sudden perturbations introduced

in [3]).

Formula (5) allows one to obtain the spectrum of photons in the transition of

atom from the state ϕ0 to a state ϕn under the inﬂuence of perturbation (8):

(10)

Here dW/dω = Pn dw0n/dω, where Pn means summing over the complete set of

atomic states. Formula (10) allows one to express the relative contribution of tran-

sitions with excitation to an arbitrary state ϕn to the total spectrum (9)

classical particle [11] with charge Za, which takes (suddenly) a velocity p.

As an another example we give the radiation spectrum in the inﬂuence of mo-

mentum having the Gausian form.

f(t) = f0exp(−α2t2)cos(ω0t) ,

where for the sake of convenience the frequencies Ω = ω/(2α) and Ω0 = ω0/(2α) are

introduced.

One should note an important generality of radiation at sudden perturbation,

namely, the radiation intensity for the multielectron atoms is proportional to the

square of the number of atomic electrons.(see [12]) This fact allows one to conclude

on the coherence of radiation of atomic electrons under such type inﬂuences.

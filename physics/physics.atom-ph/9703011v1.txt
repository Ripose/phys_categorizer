Abstract

A Feshbach resonance associated with the 1s3s4s 4S state of He− has been
observed in the He(1s2s 3S) + e−(ǫs) partial photodetachment cross section.
The residual He(1s2s 3S) atoms were resonantly ionized and the resulting He+
ions were detected in the presence of a small background. A collinear laser-ion
beam apparatus was used to attain both high resolution and sensitivity. We
measured a resonance energy Er = 2.959 255(7) eV and a width Γ = 0.19(3)
meV, in excellent agreement with a recent calculation.

I. INTRODUCTION

The metastable He− ion has received considerable attention since its discovery by Hiby in
1939 [1]. This simple three electron ion is the prototype of an unusual class of negative ions
that are not stable, but rather metastable, against autodetachment. The lowest lying state is
the 1s2s2p 4P o state, which is bound by 77.51(4) meV relative to the 1s2s 3S state of He [2].
The He− ion in this spin aligned quartet state cannot radiate and, since it is embedded in a
doublet continuum, it can only autodetach via the relatively weak magnetic interactions. The
varying strengths of these spin dependent interactions result in a diﬀerential metastability
among the three ﬁne structure levels. The longest lived J = 5/2 level has, for example, a
lifetime of 350(15) µs [3]. Metastable He− ions are therefore suﬃciently long lived to pass
through a typical apparatus with only minor depletion by autodetachment.

Excited states of He−, on the other hand, decay rapidly via Coulomb autodetachment.
Their presence is manifested as resonance structure in scattering cross sections close to
thresholds for new channel openings i. e. the excited state energies of the He atom. Many
doublet resonances have been observed, for example, as transient intermediate states in stud-
ies of electron impact on atomic He targets [4]. Excited quartet states of He−, however, have
hitherto received far less attention. Such states appear as resonances in the photodetach-
ment cross section and, to a lesser extent, in cross section for detachment via heavy particle
collisions. Selection rules on photoexcitation from the 1s2s2p 4P o ground state of He− allow
transitions only to 4S, 4P and 4D excited states. There have been several experimental [5–7]
and theoretical studies [8–10] of the photodetachment cross section of He−. Most recently,
Xi and Froese Fischer [11] have calculated the position and width of quartet states of He−
below the He(n = 4) thresholds.

The prominent 1s2p2 4P shape resonance, which lies just above the He(1s2p 3P o) thresh-
old, was ﬁrst observed experimentally by Peterson et al [12] in a laser photodetachment
study. The accuracy of the measured resonance parameters was later improved by Walter
et al [13].

In the present paper we report on the ﬁrst investigation of the doubly excited 1s3s4s 4S
state in He−, which appears as a Feshbach resonance in the He(1s2s 3S) + e−(ǫs) partial
cross section just below the He(1s3s 3S) threshold.

A two-color excitation scheme (Fig. 1) was used to isolate the He(1s2s 3S) + e−(ǫs, ǫd)
partial photodetachment cross sections in this experiment. The procedure was previously
developed for studies of threshold behavior [14] and resonance structure [15] in the pho-
todetachment cross section of Li−. In the ﬁrst step, metastable He− ions were detached by
absorption of photons of frequency ω1. In the second step He atoms, left in the 1s2s 3S state
as result of the photodetachment, were resonantly excited to a high lying Rydberg state by
absorption of photons of frequency ω2 and subsequently ﬁeld ionized in a static electric ﬁeld
of about 150 kV/m. These processes can be described by the following equations:

where ❀ represents ﬁeld ionization.

The yield of the He+ ions produced in this state selective detection scheme was recorded
as a function of the frequency ω1, while the frequency ω2 was held constant on the transition
to the Rydberg state. Thus, only photodetachment into the He(1s2s 3S1) + e−(ǫs, ǫd) chan-
nels contributed to the He+ signal. Since both laser intensities were constant during a scan,
the positive ion signal, as function of ω1, is proportional to the He(1s2s 3S1) + e−(ǫs, ǫd)
partial photodetachment cross sections.

The detection scheme based on the selective detection of residual He(1s2s 3S) atoms was
eﬀective in eliminating a potential background source unique to measurements involving
metastable negative ions. Since He− ions are non-stable, the ion beam will contain a fraction
of He atoms produced, in ﬂight, by autodetachment. These He atoms will, however, be in
the 1s2 1S ground state and therefore will not be resonantly photoionized.

B. Experimental arrangement

The 4He− beam was produced from a mass selected He+ ion beam via charge exchange
in a Cs vapor cell. The beam energy was 3.1 keV. A current of typically 1 nA was obtained
in the interaction region.

In the interaction region shown schematically in Fig. 2, the laser and ion beams were
coaxially superimposed over the 0.5 m path between the two electric quadrupole deﬂectors
(QD1, QD2). The beam paths were deﬁned by apertures of 3 mm diameter at both ends of
the interaction region. The apparatus has been previously described in more detail [16].

The apparatus was designed to reduce the background of He+ ions produced by double
collisional detachment by installing a pair of deﬂection plates (DP) just before the second

4

quadrupole deﬂector (QD2). The transverse electric ﬁeld between the deﬂection plates was
insuﬃcient to ﬁeld ionize the 24p Rydberg atoms, but strong enough to sweep collisionally
created He+ ions out of the beam.

The highly excited He atoms were ﬁeld ionized by the static electric ﬁeld in the second
quadrupole deﬂector (QD2). The resulting He+ ions were deﬂected into the positive ion
detector (PD), where they impinged on a metal plate (MP) and produced secondary electrons
that were detected with a channel electron multiplier (CEM). To monitor the He− beam
current in the Faraday cup (FC) we periodically grounded the deﬂection plates.

The two photon frequencies ω1 and ω2 used in the experiment were produced by a pair
of dye lasers pumped by a common XeCl excimer laser that delivered pulses of about 15 ns
duration. The visible laser light of frequency ω1 was generated by use of an Exalite 416 dye.
The energy in this case was about 1 mJ. The UV laser light of frequency ω2 was obtained
by frequency doubling the fundamental output generated by a Coumarin 334 dye. In this
case the pulse energy was typically 0.05 mJ. The output of laser ω1 was attenuated to avoid
saturation of both the photodetachment process and the detection system. The two laser
pulses counter-propagated and overlapped in the interaction region.

The frequency ω1 was determined by combining Fabry-Perot fringes with optogalvanic
spectroscopy. The Fabry-Perot fringes served as frequency markers whereas four transitions
in Ar, generated in a hollow cathode lamp, provided an absolute calibration of the energy
scale.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A typical measurement of the 1s3s4s 4S resonance is shown in Fig. 3. The resonance
structure appears on a background created by several processes. We found three processes
to signiﬁcantly contribute to this background: Firstly (a), collisional detachment leaving the
He atom in the 1s2s 3S state. Secondly (b), photodetachment by the laser ω2

He−(1s2s2p 4P o) + ¯hω2 → He(1s2s 3S) + e−(ǫs, ǫd),

followed by resonance ionization indicated in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). Thirdly (c), non-resonant
photodetachment by the laser of frequency ω1

He−(1s2s2p 4P o) + ¯hω1 → He(1s2s 3S) + e−(ǫd),

(3)

and then proceeding as in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2).

To reduce the collisional detached contribution (a) we maintained a pressure of 5 × 10−9
mbar (5 × 10−7 Pa) in the interaction chamber. To reduce contribution (b) we attenuated
the output of laser ω2.

The selection rule ∆L = 0 for Coulomb autodetachment in LS-coupling forbids the
1s3s4s 4S resonance from appearing in the He(1s2s 3S) + e−(ǫd) partial cross section. Thus,
the process (c), as represented by Eq. (3), contributes a constant background over the region
shown in Fig. 3. Xi and Froese Fischer [17] predict a d-wave photodetachment cross section
of 6 Mb across the resonance and a peak s-wave cross section of approximately 20 Mb.

The cross section σBF(E) around the resonance can be represented by a Beutler-Fano

proﬁle [18],

σBF(E) = a + b

(q + ǫ)2
1 + ǫ2

ǫ =

(Γ/2)

,

(4)

where E0 is the resonance energy, Γ the resonance width, q the shape parameter, E the
photon energy, a the background, and b the amplitude of the resonance structure. This
function is least-square ﬁtted to our positive ion signal.

The theory of Fano [18] leading to the above parametrization (Eq. (4)) strictly only
applies to resonances in a total photodetachment cross section.
In the present case we
investigated a partial cross section. Starace [19] has extended the original Beutler-Fano
theory to account for this situation.

Therefore we chose to ﬁt both the Beutler-Fano proﬁle and the function proposed by
Starace to our data. As expected, the values for E0 and Γ were found to be the same.
Since the Beutler-Fano formula only applies strictly to total cross sections, the value of
the q parameter is not entirely meaningful in the context of partial cross sections, and this
parameter is therefore omitted in Table I.

The data shown in Fig. 3 are recorded with co-propagating laser (ω1) and ion beams. The
ﬁt yields a value for the blue-shifted resonance energy Eb
0 . To eliminate the Doppler shift,
we repeated the measurements using counter-propagating laser and ion beams to determine
the red-shifted resonance energy, Er
0. The resonance energy, corrected for the Doppler eﬀect
to all orders, Er, is given by the geometric mean of the two measurements:

compared with recently calculated resonance parameters. The resonance parameters we
measured (Table I) are in good agreement with the ones calculated by Xi and Fischer [11].

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In the present experiment we have combined laser photodetachment and resonance ion-
ization to study a Feshbach resonance associated with the autodetaching decay of the double
excited 1s3s4s 4S state in He−. The measurement was made under the simultaneous con-
ditions of high sensitivity and energy resolution using a collinear beam apparatus. The
production of doubly excited states was enhanced by the use of a large interaction volume
deﬁned by the overlap of the co-axially superposed ion and laser beams. The residual atoms
produced in the photodetachment process were selectively detected according to their exci-
tation state to reduce the background. The energy resolution is enhanced in a collinear beam
measurement by kinematic compression of the longitudinal velocity distribution of the fast
moving ions [21]. In addition, the Doppler shift was removed, to all orders, by performing
separate measurements using co- and counter-propagating laser and ion beams.

The frequency doubled output of excimer pumped dye lasers can be used, in principle,
to study the photodetachment cross section of He− up to the double detachment limit.
Moreover, the decay of a given doubly excited state can be studied in diﬀerent channels.
We plan to search for resonances below higher lying thresholds and to investigate diﬀerent
decay channels.

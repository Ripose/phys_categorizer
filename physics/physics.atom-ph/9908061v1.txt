We examine an extension to the theory of Gaussian wave packet dynamics on a potential surface
by means of a sequence of time dependent displacement and squeezing transformations. Exact ex-
pressions for the quantum dynamics are found, and relationships are explored between the squeezed
system, Gaussian wave packet dynamics, the time dependent harmonic oscillator, and wave packet
dynamics in a Gauss-Hermite basis. Expressions are given for the matrix elements of the potential
in some simple cases.

I. INTRODUCTION

Wave packet dynamics has exposed interesting new phenomena in several ﬁelds. In femto-chemistry [1,2] we are now
able to time-resolve chemical processes and also observe eﬀects such as the breakup and revival of wave packets [3].
In atom optics wave packets are used to model matter waves [4] and electron wave packets are seen in the dynamics
of Rydberg atoms [5]. The numerical modelling of wave packet dynamics has been achieved by a number of methods
[6,2], but one of the earliest approaches was by Heller [7] who simply used the Ansatz of a time dependent Gaussian
wave packet. This Gaussian approach is, usually, an approximation and can be quite wrong, for example at turning
points. Several improvements were made: the method of generalised Gaussian wave packets [8] used complex classical
trajectories for Gaussian wave packets, and the hybrid method [9] used an expansion in terms of a grid of Gaussian
wave packets.

The approach taken here is in the spirit of the Heller’s Gaussian wave packets, but we seek to derive corrections
to the method in order to obtain the full quantum wave packet dynamics. The aim will be to move to a basis which
matches the Gaussian wave packet, and which removes all quadratic operator dependence from the Hamiltonian. The
result is a system Hamiltonian with factors depending only on anharmonic contributions from the potential. The
method, which is in principle exact, is similar to a time-dependent perturbation theory in a time dependent basis.
Indeed, it can be developed as a perturbation theory in the higher order derivatives of the system potential about the
classical motion.

The idea of a time dependent basis, resulting in ‘extended’ Gaussian wave packet dynamics, was put forward by
Coalson and Karplus [10], who wrote down an expansion of the wave packet in a Gauss-Hermite basis. Parameters
for the basis were treated in a variational method by Kay [11] and the phase space picture was explored by Møller
and Henriksen [12]. The use of a Gauss-Hermite basis has recently been expanded by Billing [13–15] to examine
non-adiabatic transitions and corrections to classical path equations. In these papers a complete basis set of states,
based on the Heller Gaussian wave packet, is used for an expansion of the system wave function. The approach
used here is similar in principle, but the focus is on the system Hamiltonian which is transformed by displacement
and squeezing in a way that removes all operator dependence which is quadratic or less. The result is an evolution
equation which depends on a time dependent ‘residual potential’ which is based on the original potential with harmonic
terms removed. By using the displacement nd squeezing transformations we can ﬁnd matrix elements of the residual
potential that determine the dynamics of the system.

In section II of this paper we set up the problem and perform a basis shift according to the classical dynamics.
Section III examines Gaussian wave packet dynamics in this displaced basis, and in the original basis by two diﬀerent
approaches. The relationship between the two approaches is established. In section IV we establish the squeezing
transformation necessary to map the time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet from its initial state. By using the
same transformation for another change of basis we can ﬁnd the equations for corrections to Gaussian wave packet
dynamics. These equations are expressed in a Fock basis in section V, where we also compare our results to the Gauss-
Hermite basis. Some examples of useful matrix elements for potentials are given in section VI, and in section VII the
results are applied to an example of an exponential potential.

The problem we wish to describe is the one dimensional problem of a wave packet in a potential described by the

Hamiltonian

The position and momentum co-ordinates have been denoted by
p to distinguish them from scaled quantities
that will shortly be introduced. The initial wave packet will be taken to be a Gaussian one. This is not essential, but
it will simplify the treatment that will follow. The key feature is that a length scale, characteristic of the initial wave
packet deﬁnes the width of the harmonic oscillator basis that we will use. For a Gaussian initial wave packet

B. Local expansion of the potential

The motion of a Gaussian wave packet in a harmonic potential is exactly solvable, even when the potential is time
dependent, and we will use this to deﬁne the local basis for the wave packet. That is, the potential function U (x)
will be expanded to second order about the the position of the wave packet. The dynamics of a Gaussian wave
packet in this harmonic potential will be determined, and these dynamics will be used to deﬁne the basis for the full
(non-Gaussian) wave packet dynamics.

The wave packet (8) is located at the position x0, which will in general be time dependent; we then take its location

to be given by x0(t). If we expand the potential about this point we obtain,

x0)2 + UR(x, x0) ,

(9)

where the spatial derivatives are indicated with the primes. The terms in the expansion are not explicitly time
dependent; they vary only with time through the position x0(t). The potential function UR(x, x0) is the residual
potential found after making the harmonic expansion. That is, it contains the higher order, cubic and above, terms
in the expansion. The residual potential will play a central role in the non-Gaussian dynamics of the wave packet,
and Eq. (9) serves as its deﬁnition.

C. Displacement of the basis

In the following, we will make two basis changes in order to match the Gaussian part of the wave packet dynamics.
The ﬁrst basis transformation will be a displacement to remove the linear term in x from the potential in Eq. (9).
The necessary displacement is simply x0(t) in space and a momentum p0(t), such that the wave function is shifted to
the origin. The new wave function will be

i.e. Ψ(x, t) = ˆD(β(t))ψd(x, t), where ˆD(β(t)) is the time dependent displacement operator

ψd(x, t) = ˆD(

β(t))Ψ(x, t) ,

−

ˆD(β(t)) = ˆD−1(

β(t)) = exp (ip0(t)ˆx

ix0(t)ˆp) ,

−

−

with

x0 + ip0
√2
The potential U (x) in the Schr¨odinger equation (4) will become transformed as D−1(β(t))U (ˆx) ˆD(β(t)) = U (x0 + ˆx)
and we will then use the expansion in Eq. (9).

(12)

β =

.

The requirement to remove the linear ˆx term (and linear ˆp term) from the potential means that after inserting Eq.

(10) in the Schr¨odinger equation (4) we obtain the conditions:

x′
0 = p0(t)
p′
0 =

−

U ′(x0(t))

which are, of course, the classical equations of motion. With these conditions the linear term in ˆx is lost and the
Schr¨odinger equation now reads

Basis displacement has been of interest in the study of quantum state diﬀusion (QSD) [16] where the non-linear
dynamics create wave packet localisation. By using a displaced basis a reduction in computational eﬀort is gained.
However, in quantum state diﬀusion there is no strong motive for going to the next step of squeezing the basis because
QSD localised wave packets all have the same size. In ordinary Schr¨odinger wave packet dynamics wave packets can
change their widths enormously making basis squeezing desirable.

III. GAUSSIAN WAVE PACKET DYNAMICS

A. Heller’s approach

For completeness we include here an outline of standard Gaussian wave packet dynamics. Heller started with the

Ansatz [7]

ΨGW P = exp

iα(t)(x

x0(t))2 + ip0(t)(x

x0(t)) + iγ(t)

−

−

in the original basis [here we use the scaled basis of Eq. (3)]. The normalisation is included in the time dependent
complex parameter γ(t), and Heller introduced the parameter α(t) which characterises (the reciprocal of) the width
of the Gaussian wave packet. The position x0 and momentum p0 of the wave packet obey the classical equations of
motion, exactly as in Eqs. (13) and (14). By substituting the Gaussian wave packet into the Schr¨odinger equation (4)
with the truncated potential

where E is the classical energy p2

Thus the dynamics of an approximate Gaussian wave packet are completely deﬁned by solving the diﬀerential

equations (13), (14), and (21). The result is approximate because Eq. (20) is an approximation to Eq. (9).

B. Gaussian wave packets in the displaced basis

In order to establish some notation, and motivate the squeezing transformation in section IV, this section gives an
overview of Gaussian wave packet dynamics as found in the displaced basis of Eq. (10). Thus starting with Eq. (18),
we again neglect the residual potential UR to obtain

k(t)
2

ˆx2

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

ψs(x, t) ,

where k(t) = U ′′(x0(t)) is a time dependent spring constant. This Schr¨odinger problem does have a known time
dependent ‘ground’ state solution (see, for example, Ref. [17]), which is not a stationary state, because of the time
dependence in k(t). The ‘ground’ state solution can be formulated in terms of local classical trajectories. Using some
of the notation of Ref. [17] we deﬁne a quantity ǫ(t), through the equation

which would make ǫ follow the classical trajectory of a point close to the centre of the wave packet. For ǫ we have the
following, complex, initial conditions

so that we have a time independent Wronskian with the value

−
Then the ground state wave function takes the form [17]

as may be veriﬁed by substitution into Eq. (22). We note that the time dependent width of this wave packet is
1/√[2Im(ǫ′/ǫ)] which is found to be
/√2 on using the Wronskian (25). The ground state wave function (26) is
|
identical to the Heller Gaussian wave packet if we transform it back to the original basis using the inverse of Eq. (17).
That is,

ǫ

If we perform the displacement of the wave packet we obtain Eq. (19) with the identiﬁcations:

ΨGW P = e−iφU (t) ˆD(β(t))ψs(x, t) .

α(t) = ǫ′(t)/[2ǫ(t)]
γ(t) = x0p0/2

where gn is a complex term arising from the normalisation of Eq. (26), i.e.

Thus we see that the Heller Gaussian wave packet corresponds to the evolution of the ‘ground’ state of the time
dependent harmonic oscillator (22).

IV. TIME DEPENDENT SQUEEZED BASIS

In order to go beyond the Gaussian wave packet approximation we need to take into account the non-Gaussian
behaviour introduced by the residual potential UR. This could, of course, be achieved in any reasonable basis, but in
order to take advantage of the power of Gaussian wave packet dynamics, which is often such a good approximation
to the time evolution, it makes sense to use a time dependent basis which matches the Gaussian wave packet. To
ﬁnd this basis it is not enough to use the displaced basis of section II C; we must also squeeze the basis to match
the (time dependent) width of the Gaussian wave packet as well as its location. Thus, in the same way that we use
a displacement operator to remove the linear dependence of the Hamiltonian on ˆx in section II C, we will here use a
squeezing transformation to remove all quadratic (ˆx and ˆp) terms from the Hamiltonian, thereby leaving the naked
dependence on the residual potential UR. This will ensure that in the special case where the residual potential is zero,
UR = 0, the transformed wave function is stationary. In this case the displacement and squeezing transformations
will map an initial Gaussian wave packet onto Heller’s moving Gaussian wave packet (19). To remove the quadratic
operator dependence we denote the squeezing transformation as ˆUs and deﬁne a wave function ψsdp in the squeezed
and displaced basis as

ψsdp(x, t) = ˆU −1

s ψdp(x, t) = ˆU −1

s eiφU (t)ψd(x, t) = ˆU −1

s eiφU (t) ˆD−1(β(t))Ψ(x, t) .

Writing Eq. (18) as

i

∂ψdp(x, t)
∂t

= [Hs(t) + UR(x0 + ˆx, x0)] ψdp(x, t) ,

we may substitute for ψdp from Eq. (30) to obtain

i ˆU −1
s

∂ ˆUs
∂t

ψsdp + i

∂ψsdp
∂t

= ˆU −1
s

[Hs + UR(x0 + ˆx, x0)] ˆUsψsdp .

The term Hs contains all the quadratic operator dependence and can be removed if the operator ˆUs obeys

To determine ˆUs we will start in the basis of the displaced harmonic oscillator, using the annihilation and creation

operators

After some consideration we express the unitary operator ˆUs in the form

ˆN =

Then using the standard expressions for the action of the squeeze operator [18], and the phase shifting properties of
e−i ˆN θ, the operator ˆUs will transform the annihilation and creation operators as

Explicit expressions for r, φ, and θ, will be found by substitution in Eq. (33). However, to determine ˆU −1
in Eq.
(33) from the Ansatz (37) we need to diﬀerentiate the exponential operator ˆS with respect to the time dependence of
its parameters. This is accomplished by ﬁrst disentangling the operator, i.e. by using the relation [19]

and then diﬀerentiating. It is then necessary to pull the non-exponential factors containing ˆa and ˆa† to one side, and
re-entangle the squeeze operator before a comparison can be made between both sides of Eq. (33). Some details of
this calculation are presented in Appendix A. The ﬁnal results for the squeezing, and phase, parameters are

A few additional relations between r, φ, and θ can be found in Appendix A.

In this way Eq. (33) is solved and we are left with the residual potential UR(x0 + ˆx, x0) in Eq. (32). Because
UR(x0 + ˆx, x0) depends on the operator ˆx it will be transformed under the squeezing transformation (37). Simply by
using Eq. (34) with Eq. (39) we ﬁnd that

Then we obtain from Eq. (32) the “Schr¨odinger equation”

(46)

which is one of our key results. It describes the evolution of a wave function entirely in terms of a “potential” with
higher than quadratic behaviour, i.e. in terms of the residual potential UR.

We note that neglect of UR in Eq. (46) returns us to Gaussian wave packet dynamics. In this case ψsdp is stationary

and we thus ﬁnd from Eq. (30) that

ΨGW P (x, t) = e−iφU (t) ˆD(β(t)) ˆUs(t) ˆU −1

(0) ˆD−1(β(0))Ψ(x, t = 0) .

(47)

This expresses the Heller Gaussian wave packet in terms of a sequence of displacement and squeezing transformations,
and would allow us, for example, to propagate a non-Gaussian wave packet in the same way as the Heller Gaussian
wave packet is propagated in time.

V. FOCK STATE IMPLEMENTATION

Our result so far, Eq. (46), describes corrections to Gaussian wave packet dynamics, but is hard to implement
because of the appearance of the operator ˆp throughout the transformed UR. However, it is amenable to treatment
in a Fock basis. If we return to the operators ˆa and ˆa† in Eq. (34) we can write

so that the Eq. (46) becomes

If we now solve Eq. (49) in a Fock basis we obtain the non-Gaussian wave packet dynamics, i.e. the extended Gaussian
wave packet, in the basis deﬁned by the motion of the Gaussian part of the wave packet. To do this we expand the
wave function in the Fock basis (of states labelled

The equations which have now to be solved depend on the form of UR and its matrix elements. In section VI we will

To determine the spatial wave function in the original (scaled) basis and in terms of the coeﬃcients an we need to

express Eq. (50) in the original spatial basis by using the transformation (30). That is, using also Eq. (37),

The values of x0(t), p0(t), ǫ(t), ǫ′(t) and an(t) can be used to determine the spatial wave function. This result for Ψ
can be compared to the Ansatz employed in the Gauss-Hermite basis used by Billing [14]. The motivation for the

(52)

(53)

basis used by Billing is, as in this paper, the Gaussian wave packet dynamics. However, Billing’s basis is the simplest
kind of basis related to the Heller Gaussian wave packet (19) for n = 0. As a result the expansion used by Billing
/ǫ)n when compared
ǫ
diﬀers from Eq. (53) by phase factors. The nth term in Eq. (53) has an additional phase of (
|
|
to Billing’s Ansatz [14] (see also Appendix B). The n dependence of this phase factor means that quadratic operator
dependence is still present in the equations for the amplitudes of the nth Fock state in Ref. [14]. For this reason the
Billing approach is not governed by a residual potential, but by a lower order potential. However, Billing achieves
optimisation by means of a variational principle which adjusts the wave packet trajectory; a process we do not consider
here. Note that while Eq. (51) requires the evaluation of matrix elements of the residual potential, similar matrix
elements for the full potential are required in Ref. [14]. Again, some analytical approaches to these matrix elements
are given in section VI.

Finally, we expect to perform a numerical integration of the various equations to determine the wave packet dynamics
of our particular system. The equations which have to be numerically integrated are: (i) the classical equations of
motion Eqs. (13), (14), (ii) the ǫ equation (23), which may be split into two complex ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations,
or four real ﬁrst order equations, and (iii) the amplitudes of the corrections in Eqs. (51). For a basis size of N states,
including the lowest energy state, this amounts to 6 + 2N real, ﬁrst order, linear equations.

VI. MATRIX ELEMENTS OF THE RESIDUAL POTENTIAL

We consider a term in UR of the form

A. Exponential terms in UR

Uβ(x) = exp(

where βU is a constant characterising the potential. This term might arise from consideration of a Morse potential
and in that case there would be two exponential terms like this one. Then, following Eq. (49), we will need to evaluate

We can write down a few examples for small q, which can also be determined by explicitly expanding Eq. (63). For

C. Using a Taylor series for the potential

We can now use the results of section VI B to determine the transformed residual potential when we expand the

potential as a Taylor series about the classical position of the wave packet,

Xk=0
with U (k)(x) as the kth derivative of the potential. Then the residual potential is simply given by

VII. APPLICATION TO AN EXPONENTIAL POTENTIAL: NaI

In this section we will apply the techniques developed in the previous sections to an example with a potential
energy that varies exponentially with distance. Such a problem could arise in atom optics where mirrors made from
evanescent waves [21], or a periodic magnetisation [22], have an exponential dependence on distance from the mirror.
However, the example we will consider here arises in a diatomic molecule where the energy of the molecule depends
on the inter-nuclear separation (denoted by R here).

Wave packet dynamics in the NaI molecule have been much described [23–25], both theoretically and experimentally.
Figure 1 shows the essential elements of the system. We consider two potential energy curves: one ionic and one
covalent. The unexcited system is ionic, but at large separations of the two atoms there is an attractive Coulomb
force which results in the level crossing near to 7 ˚A separation. For this system we may use the potentials of Refs.
[26] and [27] as, for example, used in Refs. [24,25] with

for the covalent surface and

V1(R) = A1 exp(

β1(R

−

−

e2/R

e2(λ+ + λ−)/2R4

−

for the ionic surface. The centrifugal term in the dynamics is neglected. The values for the constants in Eqs. (73)
and (74) are taken from [25] (see Table II).

In experiments on NaI (see Refs. [23]) the ground state wave packet on the ionic surface is subjected to an ultra
short laser pulse which places a wave packet on the covalent surface as indicated for t = 0 on Fig. 1. On the covalent
surface the wave packet is not in an equilibrium position, and so it it starts to move towards the crossing point. At
the crossing the wave packet divides into two pieces, and the subsequent oscillations of the wave packet in the upper
adiabatic surface have been much discussed [23–25].

Here we will suppose the laser pulse is suﬃciently short that its amplitude can be considered to be a delta function.
In that case the wave packet on the covalent surface at t = 0 is proportional to the ground state wave function [24,2],
and we take it here to be a Gaussian with a width of 0.056 ˚A. This narrow packet spreads quite rapidly, making this
system of interest to an extended Gaussian wave packet method. We concern ourselves initially with the wave packet
motion, prior to the crossing point, on the exponential potential (73).

With the potential given by Eq. (73) the residual potential [Eq. (9)] is (we will now use x, rather than R, for the

co-ordinate to maintain the notation of sections I-V)

UR(x, x0) = U (x0 + x)

U (x0)

U ′(x0)x

U ′′(x0)x2/2 .

−

−

(75)

Then when we move to the squeezed basis, x becomes transformed as x
When we form the matrix elements, as in Eq. (51), we obtain

s ˆx ˆUs as in Eq. (48).

With these matrix elements for the residual potential, the equations to be numerically integrated are: Eqs. (13), (14),
and (23).

The results for the NaI molecule may be seen in Fig. 1 as the two wave packets on the right of the ﬁgure. The full,
extended wave packet is furthest to the right, and the simple Gaussian wave packet approximation, Eq. (19), is seen
just slightly to the left. The wave packets have been derived from the amplitudes an by simply combining the an with
the spatial representation of the harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions, as in Eq. (53), and then squaring the result.

The same two wave packets are shown on a larger scale in Fig. 2. The extended Gaussian wave packet (XGWP) is
on the right, and as well as being displaced from the Gaussian wave packet it does not have a Gaussian shape because
its base is skewed slightly to right. These results have been tested against a standard numerical integration of the
Schr¨odinger equation using a split step fast Fourier transform method (see, for example, Ref. [2] for a description of
the method). The number of basis states used for the extended Gaussian wave packet in Fig. 2 was just six. However,
for this example it is found that just four basis states are suﬃcient for a reasonable approximation to the wave packet.

VIII. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have seen a description of wave packet dynamics in terms of a time dependent Gaussian basis.
Explicit expressions have been found for the displacement and squeezing parameters that describe the basis, and the
displacement and squeezing transformations have been used to determine analytic expressions for matrix elements of
simple forms of potentials. By expanding a potential as a Taylor series about the classical trajectory it is possible to
use the analytic expressions for the matrix elements (in a truncated expansion) for almost any reasonable potential
[as in Eq. (69)].

The method is good for wave packet evolution where the packet remains close to a Gaussian one, and the method
is especially appropriate if there are large changes in scale during the motion. An example of this, involving rapid
spreading, was given for a dissociative case in NaI. However, only 1D results have been presented, and the method
may not be so good for collision processes where the development of large asymmetries in the wave packet can result
in large excitation of the squeezed basis.

FIG. 1. Relevant potentials for the NaI molecule with superimposed wave packets. Expressions for the ionic and covalent
potentials are given in Eqs. (74) and (73). The wave packets shown for t = 0 and t = 0.1 ps have been scaled. The two wave
packets shown at t = 0.1 ps arise from the Gaussian wave packet approximation (left) and the extended Gaussian wave packet
approach (right). These two wave packets are shown more clearly in Fig. 2.

FIG. 2. Wave packet evolution in NaI after a time of 0.1 ps. The wave packet on the left (GWP) is from the Gaussian wave
packet approximation, Eq. (19). The wave packet on the right (XGWP) is the extended Gaussian wave packet from Eqs. (13),
(14), (23), and Eqs. (51) with six basis states.

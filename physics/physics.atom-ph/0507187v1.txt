Simultaneous Atom Interferometers

We demonstrate phase lock of two > 1.6 W Titanium:sapphire lasers with a phase noise of
-138 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz from the carrier, using an intra-cavity electro-optic phase modulator. The
residual phase variance is 2.5 × 10-8 rad2 integrated from 1 Hz to 10 kHz. Instantaneous oﬀset fre-
quency steps of up to 4 MHz are achieved within 200 ns. Simultaneous atom interferometers can
make full use of this ultra-low phase noise in diﬀerential measurements by suppressing common
inﬂuences from vibration of optics.

The ability to precisely stabilize and manipulate the fre-
quency and phase of laser light is at the basis of the
tremendous progress in precision measurements, includ-
ing the realization of optical clocks[1, 2] and tests of
fundamental laws of physics.[3] Low-noise phase-locked
continuous-wave (cw) lasers are also extensively used for
cooling, condensing, and manipulating atoms;[4] and in
particular, atom interferometry is used in sensitive gyro-
scopes, precision gravimeters and gravity gradiometers,
and precision measurements of fundamental constants.[5]
In these applications, laser light serves as a reference
for measuring the phase evolution of the matter waves.
Thus, lasers with ultra-low phase noise are required to
achieve present atom interferometer accuracy goals.

To achieve low phase noise,

fast feedback mecha-
nisms are necessary to eﬃciently remove the frequency
or phase ﬂuctuations of the laser emission.
In such
atom-manipulation systems, extended cavity diode lasers
are widely used, because their output frequencies and
phases can be easily controlled by changing the injec-
tion current. Other than using fast feedback, low-noise
phase-locking in diode laser systems can also be obtained
by injection-locking.[6] The performance of cw phase-
locked lasers has reached -94 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz oﬀset
from the carrier.[7] Although optoelectronic oscillators
or dual-frequency operated lasers for photonic systems
can have better performance (-140 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz),[8]
they generate beams with two optical frequencies that
cannot be separated into single-frequency beams and

then be redirected to form speciﬁc beam geometries, e.g.,
counter-propagation, which are essential for velocity se-
lective processes in atomic systems. Thus, phase-locked
single-frequency lasers are indispensable tools for atomic
physics research.

In addition to ultra-low phase noise, these applica-
tions often require high optical power and fast (microsec-
onds), precise steps in frequency (‘frequency-agility’).[9]
Although delicate phase-locked diode lasers can be fre-
quency agile, these diode laser systems with optical power
higher than 1 W are rare, even with the help of com-
mercially available optical power ampliﬁers. Haubrich
and Wynands achieved phase-locking of a Ti:sapphire
laser to a stable diode laser of 4 kHz linewidth with
a phase noise of about -90 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz oﬀset
by use of an intracavity electro-optic phase modulator
(EOM).[10] Here, we demonstrate a cw phase-locked sys-
tem of two Ti:sapphire lasers, each providing more than
1.6 W output power, with a phase noise of -138 dBc/Hz at
1 MHz from the carrier. Our system can achieve phase-
continuous frequency steps of 4 MHz in 200 ns.

Both master and slave lasers are Coherent 899-21
Ti:sapphire ring lasers in the high-power-pump conﬁg-
uration with control boxes modiﬁed as suggested by
Haubrich and Wynands. The master laser is pumped
with 10.5 W from a Coherent Verdi-10. The frequency of
the master laser is stabilized to its reference cavity with
supplied servo elements and electronics, and the single-
frequency output power is 1.6 W at 852 nm. The mas-
ter laser can be free-running, but will be referenced to
a Cs vapor cell for frequency stability in our future ap-

plications. The slave laser is pumped by a Coherent In-
nova 400-15 Argon ion laser with 19 W multiline output
power. An EOM (Linos PM25IR) is inserted into the res-
onator between the Faraday rotator and the upper fold
mirror. This causes the output power to drop by ∼ 20%
to 1.85 W. For locking, optical power is picked up from
each Ti:sapphire laser using a residual reﬂection from a
common optical element. A total of 2 mW reaches the
beat detector (Fig. 1). The beatnote is ampliﬁed and
a double-balanced mixer (DBM) serves as a phase de-
tector, with the local oscillator (LO) input driven by an
Agilent E8241A synthesizer at ∼ 168 MHz. In order to
prevent laser amplitude ﬂuctuations from coupling into
the phase noise measurement, a 50 MHz high-pass ﬁlter
is placed before the phase detector.

The feedback to the slave laser consists of three paths:
a slow, an intermediate-speed, and a fast path (Fig. 2).
The slow feedback path has a proportional-integral (PI)
control with a bandwidth of 20 kHz. It controls the length
of the laser’s resonant cavity through the modiﬁed con-
trol box, which modulates a piezo-actuated mirror as well
as etalons in the cavity. The fast and the intermediate-
speed feedback paths feed to opposite electrodes of the
intracavity EOM. The intermediate-speed path uses a PI
controller and a high-voltage operational ampliﬁer (Apex
PA98A, with a high slew rate of 1000 V/µs and ±150 V
swing) for driving the EOM, which provides a frequency
tuning coeﬃcient of 0.2 MHz/V. The bandwidth of this
path is limited to 0.8 MHz by PA98A. The fast feedback
path consists of a passive proportional-diﬀerential (PD)
controller followed by an RF power ampliﬁer (Fig. 2).
After this RF ampliﬁer, a directional coupler is inserted
before connecting to an electrode of the EOM to ground
the electrode for DC voltages. The diﬀerential control in
the fast path compensates for phase lag due to propa-
gation delay at high frequencies. We achieve an overall
closed-loop bandwidth of ∼ 10 MHz, limited by the prop-
agation delay in the optical and electronic signal path
lengths.

We study the performance of the phase-locked lasers

using a separate beat detector after passing both beams
through one single-mode polarization-maintaining ﬁber
with the same polarization, for an out-of-loop measure-
ment. Figure 4 (solid line) shows the phase noise spectral
density. The wideband (> 100 kHz) noise, which goes
down to -138 dBc/Hz, is measured with an HP 8590B
spectrum analyzer, and the low-frequency noise is mea-
sured with a SRS SR785 FFT signal analyzer by down-
converting the beat signal to DC with a separate DBM
but using the same LO as that in the PLL (This is found
necessary, as otherwise the measurement is limited by
the noise of LO.) The peaks at 9 MHz indicate the loop
bandwidth. The residual phase variance integrated over
a frequency range from 1 Hz to 10 kHz is about 10-6 rad2
(solid line).

For comparison, we also measure the phase noise with a
digital phase detector (Analog Devices AD9901) instead
of a DBM (Fig. 4). The ∼8 dB increase of the wide-
band phase noise probably arises from the conversion of
the analog waveforms into digital signals, where voltage
noise in the analog signal causes phase noise as it makes
uncertain the time of zero-crossings.

The frequency agility is illustrated by stepping the LO
frequency. We ﬁnd that with the DBM, phase-lock with-
out cycle slips is maintained for sudden phase-continuous
frequency changes as large as 4 MHz. This 4 MHz fre-
quency step is limited by the ∼ 20 Vp dynamic range of
the fast feedback path. The transient behavior of the
PLL is examined by adding a square wave signal to the
output of the DBM. The slave laser settles to 20% within
200 ns after each step.

The rise of phase noise at low frequencies (solid line in
Fig. 4) is mainly due to laser pointing ﬂuctuations, air
ﬂow, and optics vibration. It can be reduced by a sec-
ondary PLL: phase error is extracted from the beat after
the ﬁber, and is added to the main PLL by shifting the
LO phase. For a single atom interferometer, however,
the two beams must be sent to the atoms via separate
paths in a counter-propagating geometry. Diﬀerential vi-
brational noise in these paths would essentially increase

if the noise is suppressed to a lower level at one point
in the setup. We can avoid this and thus employ the
ultra-low phase noise of the lasers by having two simul-
taneous interferometers in an arrangement shown in Fig.
1. Four frequencies f1...f4 are generated from the two
phase-locked Ti:Sapphire lasers using an acousto-optic
modulator. Using atoms in diﬀerent (internal and/or
external) states, the individual interferometers are ad-
dressed by the beam pairs with the frequencies {f1, f4}
and {f2, f3}, respectively. In many cases, e.g., the pho-
ton recoil measurements[11] and the gravity gradient
measurements[12], the interesting physics is revealed in
the diﬀerence of the interferometer phases, which are pro-
portional to the frequency diﬀerences f1 − f4 and f2 − f3.

For eﬀective noise reduction, we take the beatnotes of
overlapped beams at f1 − f2 and f3 − f4, and phase-lock
their sum (f1 − f2) + (f3 − f4). This, however, is the fre-
quency containing the information, (f1 − f4) − (f2 − f3);
thus, the laser frequencies are generated such that the
diﬀerential phase is directly stabilized.

Noise from vibrational variations of the optical path

shifts in the individual atom interferometers proportional

such a secondary PLL for the diﬀerential phase (Fig. 1),
and measure the residual noise in the diﬀerential phase
using another beat detector at a diﬀerent point in the op-
tical path. The result (dashed line in Fig. 4) is reduced
to 2.5 × 10−8 rad2.

In summary, we have demonstrated phase-locked 1.6 W
Ti:sapphire lasers with an ultra-low phase noise of
-138 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz oﬀset, capable of making instan-
taneous diﬀerence frequency steps of up to 4 MHz in
200 ns without cycle slips. We have described the use
of this laser system for simultaneous atom interferome-
ters such that the readout of the diﬀerential phase of the
interferometers can make use of this low noise, rejecting
noise from optics vibrations. The system will be used to
perform atom interferometry for photon-recoil measure-
ments using Cs atoms with part-per-billion accuracy.

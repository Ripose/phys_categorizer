The hyperﬁne structure of the 4s 2S1/2 − 3d 2D5/2 quadrupole transition at 729 nm in 43Ca+
has been investigated by laser spectroscopy using a single trapped 43Ca+ ion. We determine the
hyperﬁne structure constants of the metastable level as AD5/2 = 3.8931(2) MHz and BD5/2 =
4.241(4) MHz. The isotope shift of the transition with respect to 40Ca+ was measured to be
∆43,40
iso = 4134.713(5) MHz. We demonstrate the existence of transitions that become independent
of the ﬁrst-order Zeeman shift at non-zero low magnetic ﬁelds. These transitions might be better
suited for building a frequency standard than the well-known ’clock transitions’ between m=0 levels
at zero magnetic ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, optical frequency standards based on
single trapped ions and neutral atoms held in optical
lattices have made remarkable progress [1, 2] towards
achieving the elusive goal [3] of a fractional frequency sta-
bility of 10−18. In 199Hg+, 27Al+, 171Yb+, 115In+, and
88Sr+, optical frequencies of dipole-forbidden transitions
have been measured[1, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Among the singly-
charged alkali-earth ions, the odd isotope 43Ca+ has been
discussed as a possible optical frequency standard [8, 9]
because of its nuclear spin I = 7/2 giving rise to transi-
tions 4s 2S1/2(F, mF = 0) ↔ 3d 2D5/2(F ′, mF ′ = 0) that
are independent of the ﬁrst-order Zeeman eﬀect. While
the hyperﬁne splitting of the S1/2 ground state has been
precisely measured [10], the hyperﬁne splitting of the
metastable D5/2 has been determined with a precision
of only a few MHz so far [11]. A precise knowledge of the
S1/2 ↔ D5/2 transition is also of importance for quantum
information processing based on 43Ca+ [12]. In these ex-
periments where quantum information is encoded in hy-
perﬁne ground states, the quadrupole transition can be
used for initialization of the quantum processor and for
quantum state detection by electron shelving.

This paper describes the measurement of the hyperﬁne
constants of the D5/2 level by probing the quadrupole
transition of a single trapped ion with a narrow-band
laser. Our results conﬁrm previous measurements and
reduce the error bars on AD5/2 and BD5/2 by more than
three orders of magnitude. In addition, we precisely mea-
sure the isotope shift of the transition with respect to
40Ca+.

With a precise knowledge of the hyperﬁne structure
constants at hand, the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of

eral transitions starting from one of the stretched states
S1/2(F = 4, mF = ±4) become independent of the ﬁrst-
order Zeeman shift at ﬁeld values of a few Gauss. Tran-
sitions with vanishing diﬀerential Zeeman shifts at non-
zero ﬁelds have been investigated in experiments with
cold atomic gases [14] to achieve long coherence times and
with trapped ions [15] for the purpose of quantum infor-
mation processing. These transitions are also potentially
interesting for building an optical frequency standard and
have several advantages over mF = 0 ↔ mF ′ = 0 tran-
sitions. We experimentally conﬁrm our calculations by
mapping the ﬁeld-dependence of one of these transitions.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Our experiments are performed with a single 43Ca+
ion conﬁned in a linear Paul trap consisting of two tips
and four blade-shaped electrodes [16]. A radio frequency
voltage (νrf = 25.642 MHz; Prf = 7 W) is fed to a he-
lical resonator and the up-converted signal is applied to
one pair of blade electrodes while the other blade pair is
held at ground. In such a way, a two-dimensional elec-
tric quadrupole ﬁeld is generated which provides radial
conﬁnement for a charged particle if the radio frequency
and amplitude are chosen properly. Two stainless steel
tips are placed 5 mm apart in the trap’s symmetry axis
and are held at a positive voltage Utips = 1000 V pro-
viding axial conﬁnement. The electrodes are electrically
isolated by Macor ceramics spacers which assure a 20 µm
tolerance in the positioning of the four blades and the tip
electrodes. For the parameters given above, the ion trap
conﬁnes a 43Ca+ ion in a harmonic potential with oscilla-
tion frequencies νaxial = 1.2 MHz and νradial = 4.2 MHz
in the axial and radial directions. Micromotion due to
stray electric ﬁelds is compensated by applying voltages
to two compensation electrodes. The correct compensa-
tion voltages are found by minimizing the Rabi frequency

of the ﬁrst micromotional sideband of the quadrupole
transition for two diﬀerent laser beam directions. The
trap is housed in a vacuum chamber with a pressure of
about 10−10 mbar.

Single 43Ca+ ions are loaded from an isotope-enriched
source (Oak Ridge National Laboratory; 81.1 % 43Ca+,
12,8 % 40Ca+, 5.4 % 44Ca+) into the trap by isotope-
selective two-step photoionization [17, 18]. The ﬁrst tran-
sition from the 4s 1S0 ground state to the 4p 1P1 excited
state in neutral calcium is driven by an external cav-
ity diode laser in Littrow conﬁguration at 423 nm. Its
frequency is monitored by saturation spectroscopy on a
calcium vapor cell held at a temperature of 300 ◦C and by
a wavelength meter with a relative accuracy of 10 MHz.
The second excitation step connecting the 4p 1P1 state to
continuum states requires light with a wavelength below
390 nm. In our experiment, it is driven by a free-running
laser diode at 375 nm.

For laser cooling, a grating-stabilized diode laser
is frequency-doubled to produce light at 397 nm for
exciting the S1/2 ↔ P1/2 transition (see Fig. 1). By
means of polarization optics and an electro-optical
modulator operated at 3.2 GHz,
laser beams exciting

S1/2(F = 4) ↔ P1/2(F ′ = 4)
S1/2(F = 3) ↔ P1/2(F ′ = 4)

Laser beams n◦ 1-3 are all switched on for Doppler
cooling and ﬂuorescence detection. We avoid coherent
population trapping by lifting the degeneracy of the Zee-
man sub-levels with a magnetic ﬁeld. To avoid popu-
lation trapping in the D3/2 manifold, repumping laser
light at 866 nm has to be applied. The repumping ef-
ﬁciency was improved by tuning the laser close to the
D3/2(F = 3) ↔ P1/2(F ′ = 3) transition frequency and
red-shifting part of the light by −f1, −f1 − f2 with
two acousto-optical modulators (AOMs) operating at fre-
quencies f1 = 150 MHz and f2 = 245 MHz. In this man-
ner, all hyperﬁne D3/2 levels are resonantly coupled to
one of the P1/2(F ′ = 3, 4) levels. Since the electronic g-
factor of the D3/2(F = 3) level vanishes, coherent popu-
lation trapping in this level needs to be avoided by either
polarization-modulating the laser beam or by coupling
the level to both P1/2(F ′ = 3, 4) levels.
In our exper-
iment, non-resonant light (δ ≈ 190 MHz) exciting the
D3/2(F = 3) ↔ P1/2(F ′ = 4) seems to be suﬃcient for
preventing coherences from building up. After switching
oﬀ laser beam n◦ 1, the ion is optically pumped into the
state S1/2(F = 4, mF = 4). The pumping eﬃciency is
better than 95 %.

All diode lasers are stabilized to Fabry-Perot cavities.
The cavity spacer is a block of Zerodur suspended in a
temperature stabilized vacuum housing. For frequency
tuning, one of the reference cavity mirrors is mounted
using two concentric piezo transducers that are compen-
sated for thermal drift. This allows frequency tuning the

spectroscopy on the quadrupole transition.

lasers over several GHz while achieving low drift rates
(typically < 100 Hz/s) once the piezos have settled.

To set the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic
ﬁeld, a single 40Ca+ ion was loaded into the trap. The
ambient magnetic B-ﬁeld was nulled by applying currents
to magnetic ﬁeld compensation coils so as to minimize the
ion’s ﬂuorescence. After that, the magnetic ﬁeld can be
set to the desired value by sending a current through a
pair of coils deﬁning the quantization axis. All coils are
powered by homemade current drivers having a relative
current instability of less than 2 · 10−5 in 24 h.

Light for the spectroscopy on the S1/2 ↔ D5/2
quadrupole transition is generated by a Ti:Sa laser sta-
bilized to an ultra-stable high ﬁnesse reference cavity (ﬁ-
nesse F = 410000)[13]. The free spectral range of the
cavity was measured to be ∆F SR = 1933.07309(20) MHz
by using a second independently stabilized laser and ob-
serving the beat note for the Ti:Sa laser locked to several
diﬀerent modes. From this measurement, also an upper
limit of less than 50 Hz could be determined for the laser
line width. The frequency drift of the 729 nm laser sta-
bilized to the reference cavity is typically less than 0.5
Hz/s. By locking the laser to diﬀerent modes of the ref-
erence cavity and by changing its frequency with AOMs
we are able to tune the laser frequency in resonance with
any transition between levels of S1/2 and D5/2 in 40Ca+
and 43Ca+. The radio frequencies applied to the AOMs
are generated by a versatile frequency source based on
direct digital synthesis.

Spectroscopy on the quadrupole transition is imple-
mented using a pulsed scheme. In a ﬁrst step, the ion is
Doppler cooled and prepared in the S1/2(F = 4, mF =
±4) level by optical pumping. Then the ion is probed on
the quadrupole transition by light at 729 nm. At the end
of the experimental cycle, the ion’s quantum state is de-

tected by a quantum jump technique. For this, the cool-
ing laser and the repumper at 866 nm are turned back on
for a duration of 5 ms, projecting the ion onto either the
ﬂuorescing S1/2 or the dark D5/2 state. The light emit-
ted by the ion is collected with a customized lens system
(N A = 0.27, transmission > 95 %) and observed on a
photomultiplier tube and a CCD camera simultaneously.
A threshold set for the number of photomultiplier counts
discriminates between the two possibilities with high eﬃ-
ciency. Finally the D5/2 state population is pumped back
to S1/2 by means of another grating-stabilized diode laser
operating at 854 nm. This measurement cycle is repeated
a hundred times before setting the probe laser to a dif-
ferent frequency and repeating the experiments all over
again.

In order to set the magnetic ﬁeld precisely, we use
a single 40Ca+ ion to determine the ﬁeld strength by
measuring the frequency splitting of the two transitions
S1/2(m = +1/2) ↔ D5/2(m′ = +5/2) and S1/2(m =
+1/2) ↔ D5/2(m′ = −3/2). Stray magnetic ﬁeld oscil-
lating at multiples of 50 Hz change the magnitude of the
ﬁeld by less than 2 mG over one period of the power line
frequency. By synchronizing the experiments with the
phase of the power line, ac-ﬁeld ﬂuctuations at multiples
of 50 Hz are eliminated as a source of decoherence. As
the duration of a single experiment typically is on the
order of 20 ms, this procedure does not signiﬁcantly slow
down the repetition rate of the experiments.

and metastable state. Here, h is the Planck constant
and AD5/2 (AS1/2 ) and BD5/2 are the hyperﬁne constants
describing the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole
interactions in the D5/2 (S1/2) state; higher-order mul-
tipoles [20] are not taken into account. Terms aris-
ing from second-order perturbation theory [20] are ex-
pected to shift the levels by only negligible amounts as

From earlier measurements and calculations of the iso-
tope shift [21] and the hyperﬁne splitting of the S1/2 [10]
and the D5/2 [11, 22, 23] states, the transition frequen-
cies on the quadrupole transition in 43Ca+ are known to
within 20 MHz with respect to the transition in 40Ca+.
This enabled us to unambiguously identify the lines ob-
served in spectra of the S1/2 ↔ D5/2 transition.
In a
ﬁrst series of measurements the ion was prepared in the
state S1/2(F = 4, mF = +4) by optical pumping with
σ+-polarized light. There are ﬁfteen transitions to the
D5/2 levels allowed by the selection rules for quadrupole
transitions. Spectra were recorded on all of them with
an excitation time of 500 µs in a magnetic ﬁeld of about
3.40 G. In a second measurement series, after pump-
ing the ion into S1/2(F = 4, mF = −4) another ﬁfteen
transitions were measured. To obtain the hyperﬁne con-
stants of the D5/2 state, we ﬁtted the set of 30 transition
frequencies by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian taking the
hyperﬁne constants AD5/2 , BD5/2 , the magnetic ﬁeld B
and a frequency oﬀset as free parameters. The hyper-
ﬁne constant AS1/2 = −806.4020716 MHz was measured
in reference [10]. The g-factors gI ′ = 2.0503 · 10−4 and

gS1/2 = 2.00225664 were taken from references [24] and
[25], gD5/2 = 1.2003(1) was measured by us in an exper-
iment with a single 40Ca+ ion. The ﬁt yields

(a)

AD5/2 = 3.8931(2) MHz,
BD5/2 = 4.241(4) MHz,

where the standard uncertainty of the determination is
added in parentheses. The average deviation between
the measured and the ﬁtted frequencies is about 1 kHz.
If gD5/2 is used as a free parameter, we obtain gD5/2 =
1.2002(2) and the ﬁtted values of the hyperﬁne constants
do not change. Also, adding a magnetic octupole inter-
action [20] to the hyperﬁne Hamiltonian does not change
the ﬁt values of the hyperﬁne constants.

B.

Isotope shift

After having determined the values of AD5/2 and
BD5/2 , the line center of the 43Ca+ S1/2 ↔ D5/2 transi-
tion can be found. By comparing the transition frequen-
cies in 43Ca+ and in 40Ca+, the isotope shift ∆43,40
iso =
ν43 − ν40 is determined. Switching the laser from ν40 to
ν43 is achieved by locking the laser to a T EM00 cavity
mode three modes higher (νn+3 = νn + 3∆F SR) than for
40Ca+ and adjusting its frequency with an AOM. For the
isotope shift, we obtain

∆43,40

iso = 4134.713(5) MHz.

This value is in good agreement with a previous mea-
surement (∆43,40
iso = 4129(18) MHz [10]). Frequency drift
between the measurements, accuracy of the reference cav-
ity’s free spectral range ∆F SR and the uncertainty in the
determination of the exact line centers limit the accuracy
of our measurement.

C. Magnetic ﬁeld independent transitions

Given the measured values of the hyperﬁne coeﬃ-
cients AD5/2 , BD5/2, we calculate that there are seven
transitions starting from the stretched states S1/2(F =
4, mF = ±4) that have no ﬁrst order Zeeman eﬀect for
suitably chosen magnetic ﬁelds in the range of 0-6 G.
These transitions are useful as they oﬀer the possibil-
ity of measuring the line width of the spectroscopy laser
in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld noise. To demonstrate
this property, we chose the transition S1/2(F = 4, mF =
4) ↔ D5/2(F = 4, mF = 3) which has the lowest second-
order dependence on changes in the magnetic ﬁeld. We
measured the change in transition frequency for magnetic
ﬁelds ranging from one to six Gauss as shown in ﬁgure 3.
The black curve is a theoretical calculation based on the
measurement of the hyperﬁne constants. For the data,
the frequency oﬀset is the only parameter that was ad-
justed to match the calculated curve. Both, the experi-

magnetic ﬁelds. The transition frequency becomes ﬁeld-
independent at B=3.38 G and B=4.96 G with a second-order
Zeeman shift of ±16kHz/G2. The measured data are not cor-
rected for the drift of the reference cavity which may lead
to errors in the shift of about 1-2 kHz. To match the data
with the theoretical curve based on the previously measured
values of AD5/2 , BD5/2 , an overall frequency oﬀset was ad-
justed. (b) Calculated shift of the ﬁfteen allowed transitions

transition to the state D5/2(F ′ = 4, mF ′ = 3).

mental data and the model show that the transition fre-
quency changes by less than 400 kHz when the ﬁeld is
varied from 0 to 6 G. The transition frequency becomes
ﬁeld-independent at about B=3.38 G with a second order
B-ﬁeld dependency of -16 kHz/G2, which is six times less
than the smallest coeﬃcient for a clock transition based
on mF = 0 ↔ mF ′ = 0 transitions at zero ﬁeld. At
B=4.96 G the linear Zeeman shift vanishes again.

We used the ﬁeld-independence of this transition for in-
vestigating the phase coherence of our spectroscopy laser.
For this, we set the magnetic ﬁeld to 3.39 G and recorded
an excitation spectrum of the transition by scanning the
laser over the line with an interrogation time of 100 ms.
The result is depicted in ﬁgure 4. A Gaussian ﬁt gives a
line width of 42 Hz. The observed line width is not yet
limited by the life time τ of the D5/2 state (τ = 1.17s)
or by the chosen interrogation time. Line broadening
caused by magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations can be excluded on
this transition. Also, ac-Stark shifts are expected to play
only a minor role. Therefore, we believe that the ob-
served line width is mostly related to the line width of
the exciting laser.

FIG. 4: Frequency scan over the transition S1/2(F = 4, mF =
4) ↔ D5/2(F ′ = 4, mF ′ = 3) with an interrogation time of
100 ms. A Gaussian ﬁt (solid line) determines a width of 42 Hz
which is dominated by the line width of the spectroscopy laser
at 729 nm.

D5/2(F ′ = 2 . . . 6, mF ′) transitions at non-zero ﬁeld.
These measurements yielded values for the hyperﬁne con-
stants AD5/2 , BD5/2 as well as a determination of the iso-
tope shift of the quadrupole transition with respect to
40Ca+. A diagonalization of the D5/2 state’s Hamilto-
nian showed that several transitions exist which become
magnetic-ﬁeld independent at small but non-zero values
of B. These transitions are of practical importance for
probing the laser line width of the spectroscopy laser and

5

for monitoring the drift rate of its reference cavity. For
the purpose of building an optical frequency standard
based on 43Ca+ [8, 9], they might be superior to the
transitions S1/2(F, mF = 0) ↔ D5/2(F ′, mF ′ = 0) for
the following reasons: (i) the initialization step requires
only optical pumping to the stretched state S1/2(F =
4, mF = ±4) which can be conveniently combined with
resolved sideband cooling to the motional ground state
of the external potential. (ii) The magnetic ﬁeld can be
exactly set to the value where the transition becomes
ﬁeld-independent while still maintaining a well-deﬁned
quantization axis. (iii) The second-order Zeeman eﬀect
can be reduced to a value that is six times smaller than
what can be achieved for the best mF = 0 ↔ mF ′ = 0
’clock transition’. Still, we are somewhat cautious about
the usefulness of 43Ca+ as an optical frequency standard
as compared to other candidate ions. While the rather
small hyperﬁne splitting of the metastable state has the
nice property of providing ﬁeld-independent transitions
at low magnetic ﬁelds, it risks also to be troublesome
as the induced level splitting is about the same size as
typical trap drive frequencies. Improperly balanced os-
cillating currents in the trap electrodes might give rise to
rather large ac-magnetic level shifts.

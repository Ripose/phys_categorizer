Abstract

Positron binding to silver and gold atoms was studied using a fully ab initio
relativistic method, which combines the conﬁguration interaction method with
many-body perturbation theory. It was found that the silver atom forms a
bound state with a positron with binding energy 123 (± 20%) meV, while the
gold atom cannot bind a positron. Our calculations reveal the importance of
the relativistic eﬀects for positron binding to heavy atoms. The role of these
eﬀects was studied by varying the value of the ﬁne structure constant α. In
the non-relativistic limit, α = 0, both systems e+Ag and e+Au are bound
with binding energies of about 200 meV for e+Ag and 220 meV for e+Au.
Relativistic corrections for a negative ion are essentially diﬀerent from that
for a positron interacting with an atom. Therefore, the calculation of electron
aﬃnities cannot serve as a test of the method used for positron binding in
the non-relativistic case. However, it is still a good test of the relativistic
calculations. Our calculated electron aﬃnities for silver (1.327 eV) and gold
(2.307 eV) atoms are in very good agreement with corresponding experimental
values (1.303 eV and 2.309 eV respectively).

I. INTRODUCTION

Positron binding by neutral atoms has not been directly observed yet. However, intensive
theoretical study of the problem undertaken in the last few years strongly suggests that
many atoms can actually form bound states with a positron (see, e.g. [1–8]). Most of the
atoms studied so far were atoms with a relatively small value of the nuclear charge Z. It
is important to extend the study to heavy atoms. The main obstacle in this way is the
rapid rise of computational diﬃculties with increasing number of electrons. However, as we
show in this paper, an inclusion of relativistic eﬀects is also important. The role of these
eﬀects in positron binding to atoms has not been truly appreciated. Indeed, one can say
that due to strong Coulomb repulsion a positron cannot penetrate to short distances from
the nucleus and remains non-relativistic. However, the positron binding is due to interaction
with electrons which have large relativistic corrections to their energies and wave functions.
The binding energy is the diﬀerence between the energies of a neutral atom and an atom
bound with a positron. This diﬀerence is usually small. On the other hand, relativistic
contributions to the energies of both systems are large and there is no reason to expect
they are the same and cancel each other. Therefore, some relativistic technique is needed to
study positron binding by heavy atoms.

For both light and heavy atoms the main diﬃculty in calculations of positron interaction
comes from the strong electron-positron Coulomb attraction. This attraction leads to vir-
tual positronium (Ps) formation [9]. One can say that it gives rise to a speciﬁc short-range
attraction between the positron and the atom, in addition to the usual polarizational poten-
tial which acts between a neutral target and a charged projectile [1,9–11]. This attraction
cannot be treated accurately by perturbations and some all-order technique is needed. In
our earlier works [1,9–11] we used the Ps wave function explicitly to approximate the vir-
tual Ps-formation contribution to the positron-atom interaction and predicted e+Mg, e+Zn,
e+Cd and few other bound states. The same physics may also explain the success of the
stochastic variational method in positron-atom bound state calculations (see, e.g. [3] and
Refs. therein). In this approach the wave function is expanded in terms of explicitly cor-
related Gaussian functions which include factors exp(−αr2
ij) with inter-particle distances
rij. Using this method Ryzhikh and Mitroy obtained positron bound states for a whole
range of atoms (Be, Mg, Zn, Cu, Ag, Li, Na, K, etc.). This method is well suited for few-
particle systems. Its application to heavier systems is done by considering the Hamiltonian
of the valence electrons and the positron in the model potential of the ionic core. However,
for heavier atoms, e.g., Zn, the calculation becomes extremely time consuming [5], and its
convergence cannot be ensured.

Another non-perturbative technique is the conﬁguration interaction (CI) method widely
used in standard atomic calculations. This method was applied to the positron-copper bound
state in [6]. In this work the single-particle orbitals of the valence electron and positron are
chosen as Slater-type orbitals, and their interaction with the Cu+ core is approximated by
the sum of the Hartree-Fock and model polarization potentials. The calculation shows slow
convergence with respect to the number of spherical harmonics included in the CI expansion,
Lmax = 10 being still not suﬃcient to extrapolate the results reliably to Lmax → ∞.

In their more recent work the same authors applied the CI method to a number of
systems consisting of an atom and a positron. These include PsH, e+Cu, e+Li, e+Be, e+Cd

2

and CuPs. In spite of some improvements to the method they still regard it as a “tool with
which to perform preliminary investigations of positron binding” [12].

In our previous paper we developed a diﬀerent version of the CI method for the positron-
atom problem [13]. The method is based on the relativistic Hartree-Fock method (RHF)
and a combination of the CI method with many body perturbation theory (MBPT). This
method was ﬁrstly developed for pure electron systems [14] and its high eﬀectiveness was
demonstrated in a number of calculations [15–17].
In the paper [13] it was successfully
applied to the positron binding by copper. There are several important advances in the
technique compared to the standard non-relativistic CI method which make it a very eﬀective
tool for the investigation of positron binding by heavy atoms.

1. The method is relativistic in the sense that the Dirac-Hartree-Fock operator is used
to construct an eﬀective Hamiltonian for the problem and to calculate electron and
positron orbitals.

2. B-splines [18] in a cavity of ﬁnite radius R were used to generate single-particle basis
sets for an external electron and a positron. The B-spline technique has the remarkable
property of providing fast convergence with respect to the number of radial functions
included into the calculations [19,20]. Convergence can be further controlled by varying
the cavity radius R while the eﬀect of the cavity on the energy of the system is taken
into account analytically [13]. Convergence was clearly achieved for the e+Cu system
in Ref. [13] and for the e+Ag and e+Au systems as presented below.

3. We use MBPT to include excitations from the core into the eﬀective Hamiltonian. This
corresponds to the inclusion of the correlations between core electrons and external
particles (electron and positron) and of the eﬀect of screening of the electron-positron
interaction by core electrons. These eﬀects are also often called the polarization of the
core by the external particles. We include them in a fully ab initio manner up to the
second order of the MBPT.

In the present paper we apply this method to the problem of positron binding by silver
and gold atoms. Using a similar technique we also calculate electron aﬃnities for both these
atoms. Calculations for negative ions serve as a test of the technique used for positron-atom
binding. We also study the role of the relativistic eﬀects in neutral silver and gold, silver and
gold negative ions and silver and gold interacting with a positron. This is done by varying
the value of the ﬁne structure constant α towards its non-relativistic limit α = 0.

II. THEORY

A detailed description of the method was given in Ref. [13]. We brieﬂy repeat it here
emphasizing the role of the relativistic eﬀects. We use the relativistic Hartree-Fock method
in the V N −1 approximation to obtain the single-particle basis sets of electron and positron
orbitals and to construct an eﬀective Hamiltonian.

The two-particle electron-positron wave function is given by the CI expansion,

Ψ(re, rp) = Xi,j

i and ψp

where ψe
j are the electron and positron orbitals respectively. The expansion coeﬃ-
cients Cij are determined by the diagonalization of the matrix of the eﬀective CI Hamiltonian
acting in the Hilbert space of the valence electron and the positron,

and V N −1

where ˆhe and ˆhp are the eﬀective single-particle Hamiltonians of the electron and positron,
and ˆhep is the eﬀective electron-positron two-body interaction. Apart from the relativistic
Dirac operator, ˆhe and ˆhp include the direct and exchange Hartree-Fock potentials of the core
exch , respectively. The additional ˆΣ operators account for correlations
electrons, V N −1
involving core electrons. Σe and Σp are single-particle operators which can be considered as
a self-energy part of the correlation interaction between an external electron or positron and
core electrons. These operators are often called “correlation potentials” due to the analogy
with the non-local exchange Hartree-Fock potential. Σep represents the screening of the
Coulomb interaction between external particles by core electrons (see [13,14] for a detailed
discussion).

To study the role of the relativistic eﬀects we use the form of the operators he and hp in
which the dependence on the ﬁne structure constant α is explicitly shown. Single-particle
orbitals have the form

ψ(r)njlm =

1

r   fn(r)Ω(r/r)jlm

iαgn(r) ˜Ω(r/r)jlm ! .

Then the RHF equations

The non-relativistic limit can be achieved by reducing the value of α in (4) to α = 0.

The relativistic energy shift in atoms with one external electron can also be estimated

by the following equation [21]

∆n =

(6)

where En is the energy of an external electron, ν is the eﬀective principal quantum number
(En = −0.5/ν2 a.u.). The coeﬃcient C(Z, j, l) accounts for many-body eﬀects. Note that
formula (6) is based on the speciﬁc expression for the electron density in the vicinity of the
nucleus and therefore is not applicable for a positron.

III. SILVER AND GOLD NEGATIVE IONS

We calculated electron aﬃnities of silver and gold atoms mostly to test the technique used
for positron-atom binding. The calculation of a negative ion Ag− or Au− is a two-particle
problem technically very similar to positron-atom binding. The eﬀective Hamiltonian of the
problem has a form similar to (2)

H CI

eﬀ = ˆhe(r1) + ˆhe(r2) + ˆhee,
ˆhee =

+ ˆΣee,

e2

|re − rp|

where ˆΣee represents the screening of the Coulomb interaction between external electrons
by core electrons (see Refs. [14,13] for detailed discussion). Electron aﬃnity is deﬁned when
an electron can form a bound state with an atom. In this case the diﬀerence between the
energy of a neutral atom and the energy of a negative ion is called the electron aﬃnity
to this atom. Energies of Ag, Ag−, Au, Au− obtained in diﬀerent approximations and
corresponding electron aﬃnities are presented in Table I together with experimental data.
The energies are given with respect to the cores (Ag+ and Au+). Like in the case of Cu−
[13] the accuracy of the Hartree-Fock approximation is very poor. The binding energies
of the 5s electron in neutral Ag and the 6s electron in neutral Au are underestimated by
about 21% and 23% respectively, while the negative ions are unbound. Inclusion of either
core-valence correlations (Σ) or valence-valence correlations (CI) does produce binding but
the accuracy is still poor. Only when both these eﬀects are included the accuracy for the
electron aﬃnities improves signiﬁcantly becoming 20% for Ag− and 11% for Au−. Further
improvement can be achieved by introducing numerical factors before ˆΣe to ﬁt the lowest s, p
and d energy levels of the neutral atoms. These factors simulate the eﬀect of higher-order
correlations. Their values are fs = 0.88, fp = 0.97, fd = 1.08 for the Ag atom and fs = 0.81,
fp = 1, fd = 1.04 for the Au atom in the s, p and d channels, respectively. As is evident
from Table I, the ﬁtting of the energies of neutral atoms also signiﬁcantly improves electron
aﬃnities. It is natural to assume that the same procedure should work equally well for the
positron-atom problem.

Results of other calculations of the electron aﬃnities of silver and gold are presented in

Table II together with the experimental values.

IV. POSITRON BINDING TO SILVER AND GOLD AND THE ROLE OF

RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS

As for the case of copper [13] we have performed calculations for two diﬀerent cavity radii
R = 30a0 and R = 15a0. For a smaller radius convergence with respect to the number of
single-particle basis states is fast. However, the eﬀect of the cavity on the converged energy
is large. For a larger cavity radius, convergence is slower and the eﬀect of the cavity on
the energy is small. When the energy shift caused by the ﬁnite cavity radius is taken into
account both calculations come to the same value of the positron binding energy. Table III
illustrates the convergence of the calculated energies of e+Ag and e+Au with respect to the
maximum value of the angular momentum of single-particle orbitals. Energies presented in
the table are two-particle energies (in a.u.) with respect to the energies of Ag+ and Au+.
The number of radial orbitals n in each partial wave is ﬁxed at n = 16. Fig. 1 shows the
convergence of the calculated energy with respect to n when maximum momentum of the
single-particle orbitals was ﬁxed at L = 10. The cavity radius in both cases was R = 30a0.
Table III and Fig. 1 show that even for a larger cavity radius, convergence was clearly
achieved. Table III also shows the convergence in diﬀerent approximations, namely with
and without core-valence correlations (Σ). One can see that while inclusion of Σ does shift
the energy, the convergence is not aﬀected.

Table IV shows how positron binding by silver and gold is formed in diﬀerent approxi-
mations. This table is very similar to Table I for the negative ions except there is no RHF
approximation for the positron binding. Indeed, the RHF approximation for the negative
ions means a single-conﬁguration approximation: 5s2 for Ag− and 6s2 for Au−. These con-
ﬁgurations strongly dominate in the two-electron wave function of the negative ions even
when a large number of conﬁgurations are mixed to ensure convergence. In contrast, no sin-
gle conﬁguration strongly dominates in the positron binding problem. Therefore we present
our results in Table IV starting from the standard CI approximation. In this approximation
positron is bound to both silver and gold atoms. However, the inclusion of core-valence
correlations through the introduction of the Σe, Σp and Σep operators shifts the energies
signiﬁcantly. In the case of gold, the e+Au system becomes unbound when all core-valence
correlations are included.

As was discussed in our previous paper [13] the dominating factor aﬀecting the accuracy
of the calculations is higher-order correlations which mostly manifest themself via the value
of the Σ operator. An introduction of the ﬁtting parameters as described in the previous
section can be considered as a way to simulate the eﬀect of higher-order correlations. Also,
the energy shift caused by the ﬁtting can be considered as an estimation of the uncertainty
of the calculations. This shift is 0.00240 a.u.
in the
case of gold (see Table IV). Note that these values are considerably smaller than energy
shifts for the silver and gold negative ions (0.00854 a.u. and 0.00921 a.u. respectively, see
Table I). This is because of the cancellation of the eﬀects of the variation of Σe and Σp. In
particular, for gold it is accidentally very small. One can see that even if the value of 0.00240
is adopted as an upper limit of the uncertainty of the calculations, the e+Ag system
a.u.
remains bound while the e+Au system remains unbound. However, the actual accuracy
might be even higher. We saw that the ﬁtting procedure signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy
of the calculations for the silver and gold negative ions. It is natural to assume that the

in the case of silver and 0.00023 a.u.

6

same procedure works equally well for the positron binding problem. The ﬁnal result for
the energy of positron binding by the silver atom as presented in Table IV is 0.00434 a.u.
This result does not include the eﬀect of the ﬁnite cavity size. When this eﬀect is taken
into account, by means of the procedure described in Ref. [13], the binding energy becomes
0.00452 a.u. or 123 meV. If we adopt the value of 0.00240 a.u as an estimation of the
uncertainty of the result, then the accuracy we can claim is about 20%.

The calculation of the positron binding by copper [13], silver and gold reveal an inter-
esting trend. All three atoms have very similar electron structure. However the positron
binding energy for silver (123 meV) is considerably smaller than that for copper (170 meV
[13]) while gold atoms cannot bind positrons at all. We believe that this trend is caused by
relativistic eﬀects. An argument that the positron is always non-relativistic does not look
very convincing because electrons also contribute to the binding energy. Relativistic eﬀects
are large for heavy atoms and electron contributions to the positron binding energy could
be very diﬀerent in the relativistic and non-relativistic limits. Indeed, we demonstrated in
Ref. [21] that the relativistic energy shift considerably changes the values of the transition
frequencies in Hg+ ion and sometimes even changes the order of the energy levels. If we
use formula (6) with the contribution of the many-body eﬀects C = 0.6, as suggested in
Ref. [21], to estimate the relativistic energy shift for neutral Au then the result is -0.037
a.u. This is about an order of magnitude larger than the energy diﬀerence between Au and
e+Au. If the relativistic energy shift in e+Au is diﬀerent from that in Au then the positron
binding energy may be strongly aﬀected.

To study the role of the relativistic eﬀects in positron binding in more detail we performed
the calculations for Ag, Ag−, e+Ag, Au, Au− and e+Au in the relativistic and non-relativistic
limits. The latter corresponds to the zero value of the ﬁne structure constant α (see Section
II). The results are presented in Table V. One can see that the actual relativistic energy
shift for neutral Au is even bigger than is suggested by formula (6) with C = 0.6. The
shift is 0.0805 a.u. which corresponds to C = 0.08. Formula (6) with C = 0.08 also
reproduces the relativistic energy shift for neutral Ag. The relativistic energy shift for an
atom with a positron is of the same order of magnitude but a little diﬀerent in value. This
diﬀerence turned out to be enough to aﬀect the positron binding energy signiﬁcantly. In
particular, the e+Au system which is unbound in relativistic calculations becomes bound in
the non-relativistic limit with binding energy 0.0080 a.u or 218 meV. In the case of silver,
the positron binding energy is considerably higher in the non-relativistic limit. It is 0.0073
a.u. or 199 meV. It is interesting to compare this value with the value of 150 meV obtained
by Mitroy and Ryzhikh using the non-relativistic stochastic variational method [4]. Since
the convergence was achieved in both calculations the remaining diﬀerence should probably
be attributed to the diﬀerent treatment of the core-valence correlations. We use many-body
perturbation theory for an accurate calculation of the Σ operator which accounts for these
correlations. Mitroy and Ryzhikh use an approximate semi-empirical expression for the Σ
operator which is based on its long-range asymptotic behavior.

Note that the relativistic energy shift for negative ions is also large. However electron
aﬃnities are less aﬀected. This is because electron aﬃnities are many times larger than
positron binding energies and therefore less sensitive to the energy shift. Apart from that
there is a strong cancellation between relativistic energy shifts in the negative ion and neutral
atom. This means in particular that the calculation of the electron aﬃnities cannot serve as a

7

test of a non-relativistic method chosen for the positron binding problem. However, it is still
a good test of the relativistic calculations. Note also that our calculated relativistic energy
shifts for neutral and negative silver and gold are in very good agreement with calculations
performed by Schwerdtfeger and Bowmaker by means of relativistic and non-relativistic
versions of the quadratic conﬁguration interaction method (see Table VI and Ref. [24]).

We have computed the Bethe logarithms for the 11S, 21S and 23S states of the helium atom to
about seven ﬁgure-accuracy using a generalization of a method ﬁrst developed by Charles Schwartz.
We have also calculated the Bethe logarithms for the helium-like ions Li+, Be++, O6+ and S14+
for all three states to study the 1/Z behavior of the results. The Bethe logarithm of H− was
also calculated with somewhat less accuracy. The use of our Bethe logarithms for the excited
states of neutral helium, instead of those from Goldman and Drake’s ﬁrst-order 1/Z-expansion,
reduces by several orders of magnitude the discrepancies between the theoretically calculated and
experimentally measured ionization potentials of these states.

Ever since the invention of quantum mechanics, the helium atom has served as an important testing-ground for
our understanding of fundamental physics. In 1929 Hylleraas’ calculation of the binding energy of the non-relativistic
helium atom Hamiltonian showed that Schroedinger’s formulation of quantum mechanics provided a quantitatively
accurate description of not just two-body but three-body systems [1]. During the 1950’s, with the advent of fast
digital computers, calculations by Kinoshita [2] and Pekeris [3] of not only the non-relativistic binding energy but
also of relativistic corrections of O(α2) Rydberg greatly improved the agreement between theory and experiment,
and showed that the estimation of O(α3) Rydberg eﬀects arising from quantum electrodynamics was important for
obtaining agreement between theory and experiment at the level of 1 part in 106 or better. During the 1960’s and
1970’s the variational techniques employed by Pekeris on the lowest states of singlet and triplet symmetry were
extended to a wide range of excited states of the helium atom [4] [5]. During the 1980’s, with the advent of two-
photon spectroscopy with counterpropagating laser beams, which can be used to eliminate the 1st-order Doppler
shift due to the thermal motion of the atoms, it became possible to measure the wavelengths for transitions between
excited states of the helium atom with a precision of 1 part in 109 or better [6]. Though numerous examples of
excellent agreement between theory and experiment in a wide variety of contexts leave no reasonable doubt that
quantum electrodynamics is the correct theory for describing the interactions of charged particles at low energies,
the extraordinary accuracy recently achieved in high-precision measurements on the helium atom poses a challenge
to theorists to develop computational techniques capable of matching such accuracies. Since α3 is of order 10−6, it is
clear that the coeﬃcient of the lowest-order QED corrections needs to be evaluated with a relative accuracy of 10−3
or better, and the eﬀects of contributions with higher powers of α must also be estimated, to match the experimental
accuracy of 1 part in 109 or better.

For a helium atom or helium-like ion of atomic number Z, the leading O(α3) Rydberg contribution to the Lamb

shift is given by the expression [7]

where the so-called Bethe logarithm [8] is deﬁned by an inﬁnite and slowly-convergent sum over all bound and
continuum eigenstates:

ln(k0/Ry) =

Here p is the sum of single-particle momentum operators (p =Pi pi) and Ψ0 is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue E0

of the Hamiltonian H of the atom. For simplicity, we assume that H is the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian of an atom
with atomic number Z, with a point nucleus of inﬁnite mass:

which after division by Z 2 tends to a well-deﬁned limit as Z → ∞. (The eﬀects of the reduced mass µ = meMN /(me +
MN ) due to the ﬁniteness of the nuclear mass MN are subsequently included by scaling by appropriate powers of µ/me,
and the negligible eﬀect of the ‘mass-polarisation’ term M −1
N Pi>j pi·pj on the Bethe logarithm is here ignored.) With
the help of the closure relationPn |ni(En − E0)hn| = H − E0, the commutation relation (H − E0)pΨ0 = i(∇V )Ψ0,
an integration by parts, and Gauss’ Law (∇2V = 4πZPi δ(3)(ri)), the denominator D is easily evaluated:

D = hΨ0 | p · (H − E0)p | Ψ0i = 2πZΨ 2

0 (0),

but the logarithmic factor makes the numerator β much harder to evaluate. Even for a very simple one-electron
system such as the hydrogen atom, β cannot be evaluated in closed form, though several rapidly convergent methods
can be used to evaluate it to high accuracy [9], [10], [11], [12], and the Bethe logarithm of the electronic ground state
of H+
2 was recently evaluated numerically [13]. For a two-electron system such as the helium atom, whose unknown
wavefunction Ψ0 must be represented by an expansion in a large basis set, the numerical challenges are even more
daunting.

In the early 1960’s C. Schwartz recast the numerator as integral over the virtual photon energy k [14],

β = lim

K→∞(cid:16) −K hΨ0 | p · p | Ψ0i + D ln(K)+
p | Ψ0i(cid:17) ,
k dkhΨ0 | p · (H − E0 + k)−1

and thereby replaced the insuperable diﬃculties associated with accurately summing over an inﬁnite number of bound
and continuum eigenstates of H with the more tractable diﬃculty of numerically integrating an accurate representation
of the matrix element of the resolvent (H − E0 + k)−1 for small, intermediate and large values of k. When k is very
large, Schwartz found it suﬃcient to approximate the matrix element with a simple asymptotic formula. For smaller
values of k, the action of the resolvent is solved explicitly as the solution of a system of linear equations in a suitable
basis with p-wave symmetry. For intermediate k the convergence was greatly improved by including a single function
which has the same leading-order asymptotic behavior as the true solution as k → ∞.
Despite growing problems with the numerical linear dependence of his basis as the number of basis functions was
increased, Schwartz was able to compute for the 11S ground state of the neutral helium atom a Bethe logarithm
of 4.370(4) Rydbergs, which yielded a theoretical ionization potential for this state in agreement with the best
experimental values available at that time, and which remained unsurpassed until very recently.

The results presented in this letter were generated by an approach very similar to that used by Schwartz, in which
the integral in Eq. (1) is split into a low k region βL and a high k region βH. The counterterms in Eq. (1) are then
brought inside the integral to cancel explicitly the divergent behavior at large k:

β = βH + βL =Z ∞

where ψL(k) and ψH(k) are solutions of the equations

(H − E0 + k) ψL(k) = pΨ0,
(H − E0 + k) ψH(k) = (H − E0)pΨ0.

(cid:19) ,

(4)

Since H possesses overall rotational symmetry, the solutions ψL(k) and ψH(k) have a total angular momentum
quantum number which can diﬀer by only ±1 from that of Ψ0. In this work Ψ0 has S-symmetry, so ψL(k) and ψH(k)
have P -symmetry.
An elegant derivation of Eq. (2) can be found in the work of Forrey and Hill [12], which examines Schwartz’s method
from a fresh perspective and provides many useful computational techniques. We evaluate the two integrals in Eq.
(2) numerically, using the procedure described by Forrey and Hill, computing the matrix element of the resolvent at

each integration knot by solving variationally for ψL or ψH in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4). When k is very large, we use the
asymptotic approximation [14]

hΨ0 | p (H − E0) | ψH(k)i =
(cid:20)√2k − Z ln(k) + C +

The constants C and D have been computed in closed form only for the hydrogen atom; in this work they are estimated
by extrapolating the values generated by the solution of Eq. (4) at successive integration knots. This equation was
solved explicitly at each successive knot, running in the direction of increasing k, until the relative diﬀerence between
successive extrapolated estimates of C was roughly 1%. For larger k the resulting asymptotic formula was used. For
the helium ground state our estimates of C and D are 4.988(1) and -18.8(3) respectively, with the errors resulting
mainly from extrapolation uncertainty. These estimates can be compared with the value 5.18 computed by Schwartz
[14] for C and the value -20±3 he assumed for D.
The non-relativistic wavefunction Ψ0 was computed variationally using our modiﬁcation [10], [15] of the basis
set ﬁrst developed by Frankowski and Pekeris [4], which exploits knowledge of the analytic structure of the true
wavefunction at the 2- and 3-particle coalescences to improve the convergence of the variational trial function to the
exact unknown wavefunction:

Ψ0 =Xν

cν(φν (s, t, u) ± φν (s,−t, u))

φν (s, t, u) = sntlum(ln s)je−as+ct

where s, t, and u are the Hylleraas coordinates deﬁned by s = r1 +r2, t = r2−r1 and u = r12 and the ± sign is chosen
so that the product of Ψ0 and the spin function is antisymmetric under exchange of the electrons.
Our bases for representing ψL(k) and ψH(k) include functions of four diﬀerent types. The k-independent functions

χ(1)
ν = r1φν (s, t, u) ± r2φν (s,−t, u)

together with the single function χ(2) = pΨ0 provide a good solution space for small k.

For large k the solution ψH(k) becomes concentrated in k-dependent regions of conﬁguration space for which one
electron is very close to the nucleus and the other electron is much further away, so it is essential to use explicitly
k-dependent basis functions. Of primary importance is the ‘Schwartz function’ χ(3), an approximate solution of Eq.
(4) that reproduces the ﬁrst two terms in the asymptotic expansion in Eq. (5):

χ(3) = p1

exp (−√2k r1) − 1

r1

Ψ0! ± (r1 ↔ r2) .

To help approximate that part of ψH(k) which is orthogonal to the ‘Schwartz function’, we also use a fourth set of
functions χ(4)
ν , which are symmetrized sums of products of single-variable Laguerre functions Li(Rj) = Li(Rj)e−Rj /2
of the three perimetric coordinates R1 = r1 +r2−r12, R2 = r1−r2+r12, and R3 =−r1 +r2+r12:

χ(4)
ν = (r1 Lp(aR1)Lq(bR2)Lr(cR3)) ± (r1 ↔ r2).

Combinations of the exponential parameters a, b, and c can be chosen to reﬂect the strong ‘in-out’ correlation in ψH(k)
for large k. For any k the overlap matrix elements for these basis functions are very small or zero far from the main
diagonal, which enables us to avoid the severe problems with numerical linear dependence which prevented Schwartz
from using a large basis of functions of the form of powers of r1, r2, r12 times a highly asymmetrical exponential
of r1 and r2. We set a = b + c to eliminate from χ(4)
any exponential r12-dependence, which would complicate the
ν
evaluation of matrix elements between these functions and the other types of basis functions. Analytic considerations
[12] suggest that the integrand is optimised if b ≈ (2k)1/4 and c ≈ Z. We coarsely search the parameter space in the
neighborhood of these values of b and c seeking to maximize the two integrands of Eq. (2) in accordance with the
variational principle described in [12].

The calculation of βL was fast and straightforward. In this case k was small enough that there was no need to
include explicit k-dependence in the basis. χ(3) was omitted altogether, and a single average value of the parameter
b was used in the χ(4)
functions, independent of the value of k at a particular integration knot. We solved for ψL(k)
ν

functions, the χ(2) function, and 120 χ(4)
ν

in a basis with 92 χ(1)
functions. The parameters b and c were varied to
ν
maximize the integrand. Changes in the integrand due to small variations in b and c were used to assess convergence.
The βH integral was computationally expensive, primarily because including the ‘Schwartz function’ χ(3) requires
evaluating algorithmically complicated matrix elements. Since χ(3) is intended primarily to accelerate the convergence
for very large k, and since over half of the knots in our integration scheme correspond to k < 40, we chose to omit
χ(3) from the basis for knots below k ≈ 40. At each node we solved for ψH in a basis consisting of 92 χ(1)
functions,
the χ(2) function, the χ(3) function (for high k), and 220 χ(4)
functions. We then recomputed the solution of Eq. (4)
ν
after ﬁrst reducing the number N of χ(4)
functions in the existing matrices to study convergence of the integrand. A
ν
simple polynomial ﬁt in the variable 1/N was applied to the sequence of results with N = 220, 165, 120, and 84 to
generate the values of the Bethe logarithms in this letter. The error associated with the ﬁniteness of the basis for ψH
was taken as the entire diﬀerence between the extrapolated value and the value corresponding to N = 220.

ν

Other sources of numerical error arise from the numerical integration itself (for which there are good analytic error
bounds [12]), and the ﬁniteness of the basis used to approximate Ψ0. The latter error is assumed to be comparable
to the relative error in D in all cases. For neutral helium, independent runs with less accurate representations of
Ψ0 indicate that this estimate of this error is somewhat conservative. The numerical integration was parametrized
to keep the absolute error in βH and βL below 10−8. The results of independent calculations carried out for neutral
helium with a coarser mesh were consistent with the analytic error bound.

The uncertainties assigned to the Bethe logarithms in this letter are the sums of the uncertainty due to extrapolation
of ψH and the uncertainty due to approximation of Ψ0 in a ﬁnite basis. The uncertainty in ψL and the numerical
integration error bounds are negligible by comparison.

Our Bethe logarithms for the 11S, 21S, and 23S states are listed in Tables I, II, and III, respectively. The values of
k0 have been divided by Z 2 to illustrate their approach to the hydrogenic limit as Z becomes large. Scaled values of
the nonrelativistic binding energy Enr/Z 2 and D/Z 4 are also listed to provide some measure of the accuracy of Ψ0.
Uncertainties in D were computed by comparison with highly accurate results for < δ(r1) > provided by Drake [16].
The exact hydrogenic limits of ln(k0/Ry) [11], [17] and of Enr and D are displayed in the bottom row of each table,
labeled by 1/∞ (exact). Immediately above the bottom row, in the row labeled 1/∞, we list the hydrogenic values
and the corresponding uncertainties computed using the method described in this letter with 1/Z = 0 so that the
1/r12 term is removed from the Hamiltonian.

For Z = 1 the Hamiltonian H has a single bound state of 11S symmetry. As Z → 1 from above all the singly
excited bound states of a two-electron ion disappear into the continuum as the ‘outer’ electron moves inﬁnitely far
away. Hence as Z → 1 from above, the energies and all other ﬁnite-range properties of the states should tend toward
those for a single hydrogen atom in its ground state with Z = 1. The approach of the Bethe logarithms and other
properties toward their hydrogenic values as Z → 1 from above is visible in Tables II and III for the 21S and 23S
states, respectively.

We have ﬁt our ionic results to the 1/Z expansion developed by Goldman and Drake [18]

ln(k0/Ry) = C0 + C1 /Z + C2 /Z 2 + ···
C0 = ln 2 + 2 ln Z + ln(kH /Ry),

(6)

where ln(kH /Ry) is the weighted sum of the two hydrogenic Bethe logarithms corresponding to the state. Table IV
displays the results of a three parameter polynomial ﬁt for C1, C2, and C3 using data for Z = 4, 8, and 16. The listed
uncertainties come from the formal propagation of error through the regression formula and do not include truncation
errors from higher-order terms in the expansion.

Our results for the 11S state and the 21S states of neutral helium are in complete agreement with the recent
calculations of Korobov and Korobov [19]. The most accurate previous value of the Bethe logarithm of the 23S state
came from Goldman and Drake’s 1st-order 1/Z expansion [17], [18]. A numerical comparison of results for neutral
helium appears in Table V.

Preliminary values of our Bethe logarithms for the 11S, 21S [20] and 23S states of helium were used in a recent
comparison of theory and experiment by Drake and Martin [21]. The values in this letter make slight corrections
to the theoretical ionization energies of the 21S and the 23S levels in that work, while the 11S state is unaﬀected.
Modifying “Bethe log cor.” contribution in Drake and Martin’s Table II to include the values in this letter yields the
theoretical results in Table VI, which are compared with results from several recent experiments [22], [23], [24], [25],
[26].

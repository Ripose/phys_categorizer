Ultrahigh harmonics from laser-assisted ion-atom collisions

We present a theoretical analysis of high-order harmonic generation from ion-atom collisions
in the presence of linearly polarized intense laser pulses. Photons with frequencies signiﬁcantly
higher than in standard atomic high-harmonic generation are emitted. These harmonics are due
to two diﬀerent mechanisms: (i) collisional electron capture and subsequent laser-driven transfer of
an electron between projectile and target atom; (ii) reﬂection of a laser-driven electron from the
projectile leading to recombination at the parent atom.

Over the last decades, a vast amount of work has been
devoted to the study of ion-atom collisions [1] and atoms
in intense laser ﬁelds [2, 3]. However, the two areas were
almost entirely separated. No experiments on ion-atom
collisions in the presence of strong laser pulses have been
carried out. The reported experiments on laser-assisted
collisions [4] involve one-photon processes and thermal
collision energies. Also, theoretical descriptions [5] have
mostly been limited to slow collisions and/or relatively
weak ﬁelds. Recently, however, the theoretical works by
Madsen et al. [6] and by Kirchner [7] investigate fast col-
lisions in the presence of a strong laser ﬁeld. In Ref. [6],
excitation mechanisms are discussed, while Ref. [7] fo-
cuses on ionization and electron capture. In both cases,
the presence of the ﬁeld leads to a signiﬁcant modiﬁca-
tion of the collision process. On the other hand, there has
been no study on the question how typical strong-ﬁeld
processes in atoms, such as high-order harmonic gener-
ation (HHG) [8] and above-threshold ionization [9], are
modiﬁed due to the impact of an ion projectile. In HHG,
a large number of incoming laser photons are converted
into a single high-energy photon. HHG experiments are
presently pursued with great eﬀort [10, 11] since the pro-
cess serves as a source of coherent XUV radiation and
attosecond pulses.

In the present work, we investigate HHG in laser-
assisted ion-atom collision. We focus on impact veloc-
ities such that the time-scales of nuclear and electronic
motion are comparable, i.e., we have signiﬁcant proba-
bilities for collisional electron transfer from the target to
the projectile. For suﬃciently long laser pulse durations,
the laser-driven electron eﬀectively sees a large range of
internuclear distances during one laser pulse. When the
laser polarization axis is parallel to the ion impact veloc-
ity, we show that this situation results in the generation
of high harmonics with photon energies much higher than
usually obtained in atomic HHG.

The classical recollision model [12] describes atomic
HHG as a sequence of strong-ﬁeld ionization, acceler-
ation of the electron in the laser ﬁeld and recombina-
tion with the core. Within this model, the maximum re-

turn energy of the laser-driven electron is 3.17Up where
Up = E2
0 /(4ω2) is the ponderomotive potential for a laser
with ﬁeld amplitude E0 and frequency ω. The maximum
energy of the emitted photons is then equal to 3.17Up+Ip
where Ip is the atomic ionization potential. For ion-atom
collisions, we show below how the interplay between colli-
sional electron capture and laser-driven electron transfer
between target and projectile leads to new mechanisms
of HHG with cutoﬀs at signiﬁcantly higher energies.

We consider collisions of protons on hydrogen atoms for
proton energies of 2 keV (impact velocity v = 0.283 a.u.).
Due to the large impact momentum, the projectile trajec-
tory is assumed to be classical and along a straight line.
Furthermore, we use a two-dimensional model where all
dynamics is restricted to the plane that contains the tar-
get nucleus and the projectile. The internuclear vector
is R(t) = (X, Z) = (b, vt) where b is the impact param-
eter and v is the impact velocity. The interaction with
the laser ﬁeld E(t) = E0(t) sin(ωt + δ) is treated in the
dipole approximation and in velocity gauge. The time-
dependent Hamiltonian then reads (atomic units are used
throughout)

H(t) =

+ p · A(t) + V (rt) + V (rp),

(1)

t

0 E(t′)dt′, rt = r + R(t)/2, and
where A(t) = −
rp = r − R(t)/2. For the electron-proton interaction
R
V we use the softcore potential from Ref. [13]. For the
laser ﬁeld, we choose a wavelength of 800 nm and an
intensity of 1×1014 W/cm2 since these parameters are
readily available in experiment. We use a trapezoidal
pulse shape with a three-cycle turn on and turn oﬀ. The
total pulse duration is 16 optical cycles, which is equal
to 42.7 fs.

Initially, the electron is in the ground state of the target
atom, i.e., localized around rt = 0. The time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation is then solved numerically by means
of the split-operator method [14]. The initial distance be-
tween target and projectile is set to R0 = (b, −250 a.u.)
so that the closest approach occurs at mid-pulse.

Figure 1 shows the harmonic spectrum obtained for a
collision with impact parameter b = 4 a.u. and phase
δ = 0 of the laser. The two curves correspond to dif-
ferent directions of the laser polarization.
If the po-
larization axis is perpendicular to the impact velocity,
the emission spectrum has a form which is familiar from
HHG in isolated atoms: a cutoﬀ occurs at the photon en-
ergy 3.17Up + Ip. Apparently, the passing projectile does
not change the cutoﬀ energy. If the polarization axis is
parallel to the impact velocity, the result is strikingly
diﬀerent. We ﬁnd an extension of HHG to frequencies
reaching slightly beyond 32Up + Ip. The region between
3.17Up + Ip and 8Up + Ip appears like an extension of the
atomic plateau with a steeper slope. (The signiﬁcance
of the values 8Up and 32Up will be explained below.)
Furthermore, interesting hump structures appear in the
spectrum around 3 a.u., 5.6 a.u., and 6.6 a.u.

The inset of Fig. 1 shows the electric ﬁeld E(t) and
the capture probability Pcap(t) which we deﬁne as the
probability that the electron is found within a square of
size 40 × 40 a.u. around the projectile. We see that
the duration of the collisional capture process is much
shorter than the pulse length since the ion-atom colli-

parameters as in Fig. 1. The polarization axis is parallel to

sion is essentially an attosecond process, cf.
[7]. After
capture at mid-pulse, Pcap decreases due to ionization in
the strong ﬁeld. The capture probability is smaller for
the case where the laser polarization is along the impact
velocity, indicating that this geometry leads to more ion-
ization during the ion-atom collision.

Figure 2 gives a temporal analysis of the harmonic
emission for the case that the laser is polarized paral-
lel to the impact direction. Each spectrum in the ﬁg-
ure is obtained by Fourier transforming the dipole ac-
celeration over one laser cycle. We ﬁnd that the emis-
sion below the atomic cutoﬀ is nearly independent of
time. The situation is not the same for the higher
harmonics.
Initially, there is no emission of ultrahigh
harmonics (Z = −140.5 a.u.). Nevertheless, harmon-
ics up to the highest frequency are produced already at
Z = −109.3 a.u. and Z = −78.1 a.u., i.e. long before the
actual ion-atom collision. Around Z = 0, the emission

up to 8Up + Ip are generated. At later times, emission
at these energies drops and again, higher frequencies are
produced.
It is evident that the spectral structures at
3 a.u., 5.6 a.u., and 6.6 a.u. in Fig. 1 mainly arise from
emission around Z = −46.8 a.u. and Z = −78.1 a.u.
Since the generation of these harmonics is limited to al-
most only one laser cycle, individual harmonics are not
well resolved in those parts of the spectrum. The fact
that ultrahigh harmonics are already generated at times
when the approaching ion is farther than 100 a.u. from
the target clearly shows that the presence of the ion in-
ﬂuences the dynamics of the laser-driven electrons when

they are far away from the target atom.

As the next step in our analysis, we vary the impact
parameter while keeping all other parameters constant.
Figure 3(a) displays the ﬁnal capture probability Pcap
as a function of the impact parameter, with and with-
out the presence of the laser. The capture probability is
signiﬁcantly reduced by strong-ﬁeld ionization. The os-
cillatory dependence on the impact parameter, however,
is qualitatively unchanged.

Since we are particularly interested in harmonic gener-
ation well beyond the atomic cutoﬀ, we deﬁne the yield
of ultrahigh harmonics as the integrated quantity

The solid line in Fig. 3(b) displays the yield of ultrahigh
harmonics as a function of the impact parameter.
Its
overall structure is a monotonic decrease. Thus, at ﬁrst
sight it exhibits no correlation with the capture prob-
ability. A closer look, however, reveals that the “dips”
around b = 2.5 a.u. and b = 4 a.u. coincide with extrema
of the capture probability. For further investigation of
this point we deﬁne the coherence parameter C accord-
ing to C = PcapPt. Here, Pt is the ﬁnal probability that
the electron remains bound to the target atom, and is
calculated analogous to Pcap. Small values of C indicate
either ionization or that the electron is localized at one of

3

the two nuclei. For large values of C, the electron state is
a coherent superposition of target and projectile states.
Figure 3(b) shows that the maxima of C coincide with
shoulders in Suh while the minima in C coincide with the
dips in Suh.

We conclude that the generation of harmonics beyond
the atomic cutoﬀ originates from at least two diﬀerent
mechanisms. One mechanism is unrelated to the coher-
ence parameter and gives rise to the monotonic decreas-
ing background in Fig. 3(b). A second mechanism de-
pends on the strength of the coherence parameter and
gives rise to the oscillations on top of the background.

The insets in Fig. 3 show the dependence on the laser
phase δ for ﬁxed impact parameter b = 4 a.u. As we
vary the phase, we ﬁnd only modest changes in the cap-
ture probability, but a signiﬁcant alteration of Suh. Note
that phases between π and 2π give a higher yield than
phases between 0 and π. No clear correlation with the
coherence parameter C is observed, indicating that the
ﬁrst mechanism dominates. This is consistent with the
smallness of the coherence parameter at b = 4 a.u.

As an explanation of our results, we propose the fol-
lowing two mechanisms of HHG. In mechanism (i), one
of two collision partners is ionized by the laser, the free
electron is then accelerated in the time-dependent laser
ﬁeld, and ﬁnally the electron recombines with the other
ion. Mechanism (ii) also begins with the creation and
acceleration of a free electron.
Instead of recombining
at the other ion, however, the electron is elastically re-
ﬂected and is further accelerated in the laser ﬁeld before
it ﬁnally recombines with the core from which it was orig-
inally ejected.

Some years ago, mechanism (i) has been suggested
as a new mechanism of HHG in stretched molecules
[16, 17, 18], and a cutoﬀ at 8Up + Ip was derived
for the special internuclear distances R = (2n + 1)πα,
n = 0, 1 . . ., where α = E0/ω2 is the classical quivering
amplitude of the laser-driven electron. Until now, this
cutoﬀ has not been observed in experiment. One reason
seems to be that rather large internuclear distances are
required. Moreover, the eﬀect occurs only for systems
where the state of the electron prior to ionization can
be described by a single-particle orbital that is coher-
ently delocalized over both nuclei. For example, this is a
valid description for the ground-state of an H+
2 molecular
ion, but not for a neutral molecule at large internuclear
distances. In an ion-atom collision, a coherent superpo-
sition is realized if the coherence parameter C is appre-
ciable. This explains the connection between C and Suh
in Fig. 3(b).

Under the assumption of ﬁxed nuclei, it is straightfor-
ward to derive the maximum cutoﬀ for both processes
by inspection of the classical electronic equation of mo-
tion, ¨r = −E0 sin ωt. For an electron starting with zero

nuclei).

velocity at r = 0 at time t0, we have

˙r(t) = (E0/ω)(cos ωt − cos ωt0).

(4)

Thus, the largest possible velocity equals 2E0/ω, corre-
sponding to an energy of 8Up. If an electron with this
energy recombines at the other ion, it will generate a pho-
ton with energy 8Up + Ip. This explains the cutoﬀ law
for mechanism (i). If the electron is instead elastically
backscattered at time t1, the velocity is thereafter given
by

˙r(t) = (E0/ω)(cos ωt+ cos ωt0 − 2 cos ωt1),

t > t1, (5)

so that the maximum velocity is 4E0/ω corresponding to
an energy of 32Up. This maximum occurs for the case
that t0, t1, and t are times of zero electric ﬁeld.
It is
straightforward to show that recollision with the maxi-
mum energy is possible if the internuclear distance satis-
ﬁes the condition R = 3(2n + 1)πα, n = 0, 1, . . . There-
fore, at these distances we have a cutoﬀ at 32Up + Ip.
For the present laser parameters, α = 16.5 a.u. and
Up = 0.22 a.u. Although nonzero ion velocities may lead
to a correction of the cutoﬀ, we conclude that the gener-
ation of ultrahigh harmonics (Figs. 1,2) is well explained
by the reﬂection mechanism.

For mechanisms (i) and (ii), Fig. 4 shows the maxi-
mum electron energy at recombination time as a function
of the internuclear distance. These results are obtained
by numerical solution of the classical equation of mo-
tion for ﬁxed nuclei. Both curves approach the atomic
limit 3.17Up for R → 0. The maximum energies are
found at 32Up and 8Up, respectively, and this gives rise
to the cutoﬀs mentioned above. Note also that already
at R = πα, the reﬂection mechanism produces electron
energies above 16Up.

The phase dependence observed in Fig. 3 is consistent
with the reﬂection scenario due to the asymmetry of the

4

ion-atom system. Before the ion-atom collision, reﬂec-
tion of electrons can occur only for electrons that are ac-
celerated from the target towards the projectile. Under
inversion of the ﬁeld direction (phase shift by π), these
electrons are accelerated in the opposite direction where
they cannot be backscattered.

In summary, we have investigated ion-atom collisions
in the presence of a strong laser ﬁeld. High harmonics
are generated with energies much larger than found in
atomic HHG if the laser polarization axis is parallel to
the direction of impact. We have proposed two distinct
HHG mechanisms, both involving laser-driven transfer of
electrons between the collision partners. The highest har-
monics are produced by reﬂection of electrons from the
projectile back to the target atom at times when target
and projectile are far away from each other. A simpliﬁed
classical description of the electron gives a cutoﬀ energy
at 32Up + Ip for this process. In principle, the mecha-
nisms of HHG that we have discussed should appear also
in molecules. However, it seems diﬃcult to combine the
required large internuclear distances with precise control
of the molecular orientation. In ion-atom collisions, all
possible distances are sampled, and the orientation con-
trol is straightforward.

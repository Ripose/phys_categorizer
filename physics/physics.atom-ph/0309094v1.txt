(Dated: February 21, 2014)
The lifetime of the 3d2D5/2-level in singly-ionized calcium has been measured by the electron-
shelving technique on diﬀerent samples of rf trapped ions. The metastable state has been directly
populated by exciting the dipole-forbidden 4S1/2 − 3D5/2 transition.
In ion clouds, the natural
lifetime of this metastable level has been measured to be (1095±26) ms. For a single ion, we
determined a lifetime of (1152±17) ms. The 1σ-error bars at the 2%-level have diﬀerent origins for
the two kinds of experiments: data ﬁtting methods for lifetime measurements in an ion cloud and
control of experimental parameters for a single ion. De-shelving eﬀects are extensively discussed.
The inﬂuence of diﬀering approaches for the processing of the single-ion quantum jump data on the
lifetime values is shown. Comparison with recent measurements shows excellent agreement when
evaluated from a given method.

INTRODUCTION

High-precision atomic

lifetime measurements are
a challenge for experimental and theoretical atomic
physics. Increasing volume and precision of astrophys-
ical observations have generated a growing need for pre-
cise atomic lifetime data [1]. Among all the interesting
atomic systems, hydrogenlike atoms oﬀer the possibility
to closely compare the results of atomic data modeling
and experimental values.

There have been various theoretical approaches to the
low-lying metastable doublet levels of 40Ca+ which have
generated somewhat dispersed metastable lifetime pre-
dictions [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

In the past decade the lifetimes of the metastable D-
levels of the singly-ionized calcium have also been mea-
sured several times [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21]. Most of these measurements have been carried
out on single ions in rf traps, showing a clear evolution
towards longer lifetimes throughout the years, as error
sources have been identiﬁed. The experiments which
have been carried out on single laser-cooled ions show
a typical error bar of the order of 2%, with the exception
of one experiment [20], where the announced uncertainty
is inferior to 0.6% and which gives the highest value
ever measured for the 3D5/2-lifetime. In this article, we
present our measurements which have been carried out
by direct pumping of the electric quadrupole transition

which connects the ground state to the 3D5/2 metastable
state and we establish the connection between the diﬀer-
ent published values, the discrepancy being mainly due
to diﬀering data analysis.

Single trapped ions are now extensively used for
metrology and quantum information [22]. Storage times
can exceed days, and the control of the trapping envi-
ronment along with the degree of laser stabilization have
been improved to access linewidths of optical transitions
down to the Hz-level [23]. Our experimental project aims
to propose a frequency standard in the optical domain,
based on the interrogation of the 4S1/2 − 3D5/2 electric
quadrupole transition of a single laser-cooled Ca+-ion.
The measurement of the metastable 3D5/2-level lifetime
is an important step in this direction, allowing to iden-
tify and to control eﬀects which may reduce this lifetime,
and which could thus contribute to the broadening of the
clock transition.

In this paper, we brieﬂy present our experimental de-
vice, and introduce the technique we have used to mea-
sure metastable lifetimes in ion clouds and single ions.
We then present the diﬀerent data processing methods.
The fourth part of this article is devoted to the discus-
sion of the uncertainties of our measurements. We ﬁnally
present and discuss our results in the context of previous
experiments.

FIG. 1: Experimental setup of the miniature ion trap. The
insets show the Ca+ lowest lying levels and the geometry of
the miniature trap.

a modiﬁed Paul trap, a so-called Paul-Straubel trap [24]
consisting of a cylindrical molybdenum ring with an inner
diameter of 2r0 = 1.4 mm and a total ring height of 2z1 =
0.85 mm (Figure 1). Two circular mesh electrodes at 5.5
mm on each side from the trap center, allow the deﬁnition
of well controlled electrical boundary conditions. Two
copper tip electrodes in the plane of the trapping ring are
used as positioning electrodes to correct for imperfections
and asymmetries in the trapping potential and thus to
reduce the micromotion of the conﬁned ions. The applied
trapping frequency Ω/2π = 11.6 MHz with an rf voltage
amplitude of 300 V, gives rise to a total pseudo-potential
well depth of 1.9 eV and motional frequencies around
ωi/2π = 1.5 MHz. The trap has been fully characterized
and is described in detail in [25]. The trapping setup is
mounted into an ultra-high vacuum vessel and baked out
at 150◦C during a couple of days. Vacuum conditions
can be controlled by the ion pump current, a Bayard-
Alpert gauge and a mass spectrometer operating up to
64 a.m.u.. Ions in the trap are created from a calcium
oven heated by a direct current of 3 A. The eﬀusive atom
beam is crossed with a low-energy electron beam in the
center of the trap producing singly-ionized calcium ions.
Laser-cooling is carried out on the 4S1/2 − 4P1/2 elec-
tric dipole transition at 397 nm using an intracavity
frequency-doubled TiSa-laser [Coherent 899]. The out-
put of this laser is stabilized in intensity by a single-pass
acousto-optical modulator (AOM), the error signal is fed
back from a beam pick-up photodiode after crossing the
trap. The optical power used for laser-cooling is about 50

2

µW in the case of an ion cloud, and an order of magnitude
lower for a single ion. The linewidth of this laser has been
found to be below 10 MHz in the course of our experi-
ments. Due to a branching ratio to the 3D3/2-level larger
than 5%, repumping from this level is required, and is as-
sured by a single-mode diode laser at 866 nm mounted
in a Littrow-conﬁguration external cavity (ECDL). This
diode laser is stabilized to a low ﬁnesse (F =200) refer-
ence cavity reducing its linewidth to about 1 MHz and
improving its frequency stability. Stable operation dur-
ing a whole day is achieved by locking the length of the
reference cavity to a hyperﬁne transition of neutral cae-
sium making use of an additional ECDL at 852 nm and
a standard saturated-absorption setup. Typical power
for the 866 nm-diode is about 200 µW focussed into a
70 µm-diameter waist (measured at 1/e2 power level).
A broad-area laser diode is used to probe the electric
quadrupole transition 4S1/2 − 3D5/2 at 729 nm . The
nominal output power of this laser diode is 100 mW and
its free-running linewidth is as large as 2 nm. This diode
has been set up in an external cavity in Littrow conﬁg-
uration and pre-stabilized by electronic feedback onto a
low-ﬁnesse reference cavity (F =200) . We thus obtain a
laser linewidth in the MHz-range and a laser intensity of
approximately 350 µW per 60 µm-diameter waist size in
the trap [26].

Two mechanical shutters in the 729 nm-beam line al-
low to cut the light from this laser completely. Their
closing time is in the ms-range, inferior to the smallest
measurement interval used throughout the experiment.
All the laser beams used in this experiment are brought
to the ion trap by single-mode optical ﬁbers. This allows
the spatial ﬁltering of the laser beams and gives rise to
well controlled waist sizes at the position of the ion. How-
ever, the main advantage of these ﬁbers is to increase the
pointing stability of the laser beams, which improves the
day-to-day reproducibility of the measurements essential
for trapping single ions.

Detection of the ﬂuorescence of the ions is made out-
side the vacuum vessel (Figure 1). The ﬂuorescence sig-
nal is spatially ﬁltered by a small diaphragm (diame-
ter below 500 µm) and then projected onto an intensi-
ﬁed CCD camera (ICCD) and a photomultiplier (PM) in
photon counting mode. A variable beamsplitter between
these two devices allows to choose the fraction of signal
sent to the photomultiplier between 10 and 100 %. The
maximum ﬂuorescence count is about 10000 counts/sec
for a single ion. Data is collected and stored by a personal
computer, that also controls the ion creation process and
actuates the laser shutters. Excellent temporal synchro-
nization is assured by buﬀer-controlled read-out on the
data acquisition board. The typical duration of a mea-
surement bin is 50 ms for the ion cloud measurements
and 30ms for the single-ion measurements.

729-nm laser power has been recorded simultaneously and is
shown in the lower trace. The solid line shows simulation data
in identical conditions.

III. ELECTRON SHELVING

All our lifetime measurements have been performed in
the same trap, in a very similar way for a small ion cloud
or a single ion. In both cases, ions have been laser-cooled
on the strong 4S1/2 − 4P1/2 electric dipole transition
and detected by the scattered 397 nm-photons. We have
used the technique of electron-shelving proposed by H.G.
Dehmelt [27] for the whole set of measurements. This
method allows to observe transitions on the forbidden
electric quadrupole line via the switching of the strong
laser-cooling transition at 397 nm. In our experiment the
3D5/2-state has been populated by direct optical pump-
ing of the dipole-forbidden 4S1/2−3D5/2 transition, tech-
nique which has not yet been applied in the lifetime mea-
surements with single trapped Ca+-ions. The direct ex-
citation of this electric quadrupole transition allows an
unambiguous deﬁnition of initial conditions. However,
to avoid any coupling between metastable and ground
state, we have to assure complete extinction of the excit-
ing laser during shelving . Isolation to a very high degree
has been achieved by the mechanical shutters.

A. measurements in an ion cloud

A typical ion cloud contains 50 to 100 Ca+-ions which
are laser-cooled to a temperature of about 50 K, temper-
ature which is deﬁned as a measure of the kinetic energy
of the trapped particles. This temperature value stands
for an equilibrium between the heating of the ions by the
trapping ﬁeld and the laser-cooling.

To measure the 3D5/2-level lifetime in an ion cloud we
use approximately 350 µW of 729 nm-power focussed in

3

a 60 µm-diameter waist onto the ion cloud. Once the res-
onant laser beam is admitted onto the ions, a fraction of
the ions is pumped into the 3D5/2-state, the experimen-
tal signal is shown in ﬁgure 2. In this coupled four-level
system, the fraction of ions which are pumped into the
metastable D5/2-state depends not only on the power
used for the probing of the electric quadrupole transition
but also on the optical power used for laser-cooling and
repumping in the presented excitation scheme. A simula-
tion program using the density matrix formalism allows
to reproduce the ion behaviour in an identical way, giv-
ing access to the control of experimental parameters, e.g.
laser power and detuning of the implied transitions. The
solid line in ﬁgure 2 visualizes the simulation data.

When the population of the 3D5/2-state has reached an
equilibrium state which is represented by a constant ﬂuo-
rescence level, we shut oﬀ the 729 nm diode laser. The ion
population then decays to the ground state with a time
constant governed by the 3D5/2-state natural lifetime.
This decay can be observed on the 397 nm ﬂuorescence
signal as the decaying ions return into the laser-cooling
cycle and scatter blue photons. The revival function of
the 397 nm ﬂuorescence is ﬁtted with a least-squares
method by the function F (t) = S0 + S · (1 − exp(− t
τm ))
where τm is the measured lifetime for a given set of ex-
perimental parameters, S the net ion signal and S0 the
low-level signal being composed by the ﬂuorescence sig-
nal of the ions remaining in the laser-cooling cycle and
the background signal due to stray light. Actually, the
measured lifetime τm is the natural lifetime of the 3D5/2-
level aﬀected by diﬀerent de-shelving eﬀects as will be dis-
cussed in section IV. The result for the measured lifetime
in an ion cloud is τnat = 1095 ms with an 1σ-statistical
error of 7.5 ms.

B. measurements with a single ion

Experiments with single ions have been carried out
during twelve 6h-runs with single ions laser-cooled to
temperatures below 1K. As the temperature of the ion
is estimated from the asymmetric Doppler proﬁle and is
largely depending on the optical power used for laser-
cooling, this temperature is an upper limit to the esti-
mate of the kinetic energy.

When the electron-shelving technique is applied to a
single ion, the observed ﬂuorescence signal becomes bi-
nary. Actually, while the ion is in the laser-cooling cycle,
a large number of blue photons is scattered giving rise
to a high photon count rate (”bright” level), see ﬁgure
3. We apply the 729 nm diode laser to the ion, and
at the right choice of laser power and frequency the ion
will be pumped into the 3D5/2-level. The ﬂuorescence
rate at 397 nm will then abruptly fall to the low level,
which corresponds to the background light (”dark” level).
These sudden changes in ﬂuorescence due to transitions
between atomic levels are called quantum jumps. Fig-
ure 3 shows the good distinction between the bright and

the dark level. This allows to deﬁne an unambiguous
threshold value for the determination of the duration of
the quantum jumps. Typically, we have set the thresh-
old value at the half of the net signal value, which is the
diﬀerence between the mean upper trace and the mean
lower trace. Variation of the threshold value separating
dark and bright level between one third and two third of
the net signal did not result in variations of the quan-
tum jump length distribution. The histogram of the ob-
served dark intervals represents the decay curve of the
metastable levels (ﬁgure 4).

These decay curves have been processed by two diﬀer-
ent methods. They have been ﬁtted by a least-squares
method using an exponential decay curve (F (t) = A ·
exp(− t
τm )) with two free parameters (A and τm) at a
95% conﬁdence level. Taking into account de-shelving
eﬀects as discussed in section IV, in particular the in-
ﬂuence of the 866nm-diode, the obtained lifetime value
is τnat = 1088 ms with a statistical uncertainty of 13.5
ms. Recent measurements [20, 21] have evaluated the
metastable lifetime by using the method of maximum
likelihood obtaining values larger than 1150 ms. Actu-
ally, the probability of very long events is in most cases
very low (see ﬁgure 4), suggesting that deviations from
the mean are not governed by a Gaussian distribution. It
is then appropriate to apply the most general evaluation
method, assuming a multinomial distribution, and cal-
culating the lifetime by a maximum likelihood estimate
(MLE). We have used the same formula as in [21], that
is

ti, and N is the total number of measured events. Our
result is then τnat = 1152 ms. Since this method is not a
ﬁtting method, but relies on the calculation of the mean
value, the statistical uncertainty for our data is reduced,
giving 2 ms.

IV. EVALUATION OF UNCERTAINTIES

Among the uncertainties on the measured lifetimes of
the metastable 3D5/2-level of Ca+ we distinguish be-
tween the ones which are due to data processing and
those due to physical eﬀects which may aﬀect the appar-
ent lifetime of the state.

A. De-shelving eﬀects

The lifetimes we measure in the course of our exper-
iments are function of the experimental parameters as
various physical eﬀects tend to shorten the observed life-
times. The major de-shelving eﬀects are collisions with
the residual gas, heating or loss of the ions, and coupling
of the atomic levels by laser light. The measured lifetime
τm can therefore be expressed as

γm =

1
τm

=

1
τnat

+nB(Γquench+Γmix)+γheat+γloss+γcoupling.

(2)
We will discuss the inﬂuence of these de-shelving eﬀects
in detail in the following, their quantitative inﬂuence on
the measured lifetimes is summarized in table I.

We have looked for an eventual eﬀect of the trap-
ping potential and of the detuning of the 397 nm laser.

Ion heating

Both parameters could inﬂuence the temperature of the
trapped ions and eventually give rise to an increased
amount of collisions. Nevertheless, we could not evidence
any variation of the measured lifetime in the limit of the
announced error bars.

1. Collisional eﬀects

The apparent lifetime of the metastable state can be re-
duced by inelastic collisions with (neutral) particles from
the residual gas background. The base pressure of the
ultra-high vacuum vessel is below 5×10−10 mbar as mea-
sured by the ion pump current and the two gauges. From
our previous measures of quenching and j-mixing reaction
rates in hot ion clouds [15, 28] and from the measured
composition of the residual gas background by the mass
spectrometer, we can deduce that the only non-negligible
component giving rise to inelastic collisions is hydrogen.
In fact, the partial hydrogen pressure for ion cloud ex-
periments is inferior to 2 × 10−9 mbar, and below the
resolution of the mass spectrometer (1 × 10−9 mbar) for
single ion experiments. The diﬀerence in the pressure val-
ues for both types of experiments is due to the duration
and frequency of the ion creation process.

For the ion cloud experiments the residual hydrogen
pressure results in a value of nBΓquench ≤ (1.8 ± 0.7) ×
10−3 s−1 due to quenching while the contribution of the
ﬁne-structure mixing collisions is nBΓmix ≤ (14 ± 10) ×
10−3 s−1.

The observation of quantum jumps in a single ion al-
lows the direct measurement of the collision rate in the
absence of the 729-nm laser. Every once in a while,
the ion undergoes a quantum jump due to an inelas-
tic collision with a particle from the residual gas. We
have recorded these quantum jumps which are the re-
sult of collisional transfer between the ﬁne-structure lev-
els and from the ground-state. At a base pressure of
2 × 10−10 mbar we have measured an average of 1 quan-
tum jump every 5 minutes resulting in a collision rate of
nBΓcoll ≤ 3 × 10−3 s−1.

Temperature changes in the ion cloud could play a role
in the determination of lifetimes due to changing colli-
sion rates and to varying frequency overlap (and there-
fore varying excitation eﬃciency) between the ions and
the applied lasers. In the ion cloud experiments we have
tuned our experimental parameters to make sure that not
more than one half of the ion cloud is pumped into the
metastable state. As the laser-cooling is permanently ap-
plied to the rest of the ion cloud, sympathetic cooling of
the dark ions prevents these from heating [29]. We can
yet give an upper limit for the inﬂuence of ion heating of
γheat ≤ 1 × 10−3 s−1.

As for the single ions, heating becomes visible if the
laser-cooling parameters (mainly the frequency and the
power of the 397-nm laser) are largely detuned. Af-
ter a dark interval the ion will then slowly return to
the ”bright” ﬂuorescence level over several measurement
bins. In our lifetime measurements, we have made sure
that the laser-cooling parameters are optimized and that
the ion signal returns to the upper ﬂuorescence trace in a
time shorter than one measurement bin (30ms), even for
dark times which are superior to 10 seconds. Moreover,
to ensure eﬃcient cooling of the ion, we maintain it in
the laser-cooling cycle for at least 600 ms before the 729
nm laser is again admitted to the trap.

3.

Ion loss

The revival function of the ﬂuorescence in the ion cloud
could be biased by competing decay processes, in partic-
ular ion loss. Ion loss is not visible on a single revival
function but it will be detectable on the over-all ﬂuores-
cence signal after a one-hour run. The upper limit for
the inﬂuence of ion loss on the lifetime measurements in
an ion cloud is given by γloss < 7 × 10−3 s−1.

If the ion is lost, while we are observing quantum
jumps, we have to reload a new ion. To make sure, that
the vacuum conditions are identical throughout the whole
set of experiments, we wait for about half an hour before

we restart data acquisition.

4. Level coupling by laser light

All the laser beams used in this experiment may in
principle couple the diﬀerent atomic levels, due to the
Stark eﬀect induced by the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the
laser. Atomic level coupling by the 397 nm laser is negli-
gible, laser power at this wavelength being around 50 µW
for an ion cloud and below 10 µW for the experiments
with a single ion.

a.

729 nm One important factor for the reduction
of the metastable lifetime is coupling by the 729-nm laser.
In fact, even at low laser powers, this laser may induce
transitions to the ground state by stimulated emission
on the 4S1/2 − 3D5/2 line. We have taken precautions to
avoid any coupling by this laser.

In any case we have to shut oﬀ the laser by a mechan-
ical shutter in front of the trap for the observation of
the revival function in the ion cloud measurements. The
applied power at 729 nm is measured by a beam pick-
up photodiode at the entrance of the trap. The instant
where the power falls to zero is used to ﬁx the starting
point for the ﬁt of the revival function.

In the single ion experiments complete extinction of
the laser at 729 nm is essential to avoid reduction of the
length of the dark intervals. We use a system of two
synchronized mechanical shutters, one at the entrance
of the optical ﬁber and one at its output, to guarantee
maximum isolation from this radiation. When both shut-
ters are closed, the 729-nm light level is inferior to the
detection limit. For the excitation of quantum jumps,
the 729-nm laser is applied to the laser-cooled ion, when
the ﬂuorescence level falls below threshold, the shutters
are immediately closed. During the ﬁrst measurement
bins the 729-nm radiation is thus still present in the trap
and we have to remove these earliest points to make sure
that the decay conditions are well deﬁned. In our eval-
uation of the distribution of the quantum jumps, we use
data starting only at the ﬁfth bin, which means that we
do not take into account the ﬁrst 120 ms of a quantum
jump, and that quantum jumps whose duration is equal
or inferior to that value are completely omitted. As a
consequence, low-signal bins due to noise, which are typ-
ically of the length of one bin are also eliminated.

866 nm The main eﬀect which reduces the life-
time of the metastable state is the coupling by the re-
pumper laser at 866nm [18], which is necessary for laser-
cooling. We insist on this point, as this ”helper” laser
is often applied with optical power levels largely beyond
saturation to compensate for spatial and spectral insta-
bilities.

b.

We have checked our lifetime measurements versus the
intensity of the repumper laser (see ﬁgure 5), observing
a reduction of the apparent lifetime of the 3D5/2-level
due to the AC Stark eﬀect which couples the 3D5/2- and
4P3/2-states. The measured lifetime of the ions varies as

of the laser at 866nm in mW/mm2, and τm and τnat are
the measured and natural lifetimes, respectively. The
quantitative dependence of the lifetime on the 866 nm-
intensity we have found is of the same order of magnitude
as previous measurements [18, 20].

We would like to point out the fact that measurements
as a function of the optical power are not easy to perform.
On the one hand, absolute calibration of the instrument
of measure is wavelength-dependent and in general not
constant in time. More delicate still is the measure of the
waist size in the ultrahigh-vacuum vessel. We have mea-
sured the waist sizes on diﬀerent days by a commercial
instrument (Melles Griot BeamAlyzer) just in front of
the entrance of the trap by deviation with a high-quality
mirror. This measurement is just an estimate of the waist
dimension, as the position and shape of the focal point
after the vacuum windows are certainly distorted. Ad-
ditionally, the trajectory of the ion may be smaller than
the waist of the laser. As a consequence, the error bar on
the laser power seen by a single ion is diﬃcult to estimate
and may easily reach 10%.

B. Data analysis eﬀects

To determine the 3D5/2-level lifetime from the ion-
cloud experiments we ﬁtted more than 1700 revival
graphs using a least-squares ﬁtting method. Because we
could not evidence any dependence of the lifetime on any
experimental parameter, the complete set of decay con-
stants has been taken into account to establish the ﬁnal
value. It has been found for these values that diﬀerent
methods of data analysis gave slightly diﬀerent results.

Actually, the mean value of the ﬁtted time constants is
not identical to the ﬁt of the sum of the revival curves.
Furthermore, harmonic and geometric mean are not iden-
tical. We have simulated shelving data of the ion cloud at
a given decay rate having the same Gaussian noise pat-
tern as our experimental data. These generated data are
free from experimental bias such as ion loss or laser insta-
bilities. Fitting these data demonstrated the variations
from the diﬀerent evaluation approaches, which could be
as large as 1.6 % and forms the major contribution to
the total error bar.

For a single ion, the total number of quantum jumps
taken into account is superior to 40000. For the experi-
mental points in ﬁgure 5 the mean quantum jump number
per set of experimental parameters is of the order of 4000.
As the number of bins is very high (≥ 400), the number
of events per bin can be very low, explaining the rela-
tively high statistical uncertainty of this measurement.
This latter argument speaks in favor of the application
of the maximum-likelihood method, mainly due to the
very low count rate in the long-lived channels.

Table I summarizes the quantitative inﬂuence of the
diﬀerent eﬀects which deﬁne the precision of our mea-
surements. Data analysis eﬀects play a major role in the
evaluation of the electron-shelving curves in a small ion
cloud, whereas the main error contribution in single-ion
measurements comes from the estimation of the applied
laser power independent of the data processing method.
The total error bar represent an uncertainty on the mea-
surement of the lifetimes of 2.4% in the case of the ion
cloud and 1.9% and 1.4% for the single-ion experiments.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

From the described measurements, the natural lifetime
of the 3d2D5/2-level lifetime has been found to be τIC =
(1095 ± 27) ms in an ion cloud and τQJ = (1152 ± 17) ms
in a single ion. These two values are very close, though
their 1σ error bars do not overlap. This discrepancy
could be an evidence that ion-ion-collisions in the trap
eventually contribute to the reduction of the lifetime.
In the laser-cooled ion cloud the particle density of the
Ca+-ions is roughly 108cm−3. If we suppose an eventual
lifetime reduction on the 1%-level, we can estimate the
upper limit of the contribution of ion-ion collisions to be
Γiic ≤ 1.2 × 10−10 cm3s−1.

In view of the measured probability distributions, we
consider that the estimation of the lifetime in single ion
measurements has to be made by the method of maxi-
mum likelihood. Nevertheless, we have also evaluated our
data by using the least-squares minimization of the expo-
nential ﬁtting curve. The result which has been found by
this method (1088 ms ± 21 ms) is in very good agreement
with experimental values which have been determined in
the past by least-squares methods [18, 19] with compa-
rable probability distributions. The discrepancy between
these values and recent measurements [20, 21] as well as

our value τQJ = (1152 ± 17) ms is apparently due to the
data processing method, as the exponential ﬁt method
is biased towards short-lived channels which accounts for
the diﬀerence of almost 5% in the lifetime result.

Figure 6 shows all the measurements and calculations
that have been carried out on the Ca+-ion over the last
years. A wide variety of theoretical models has been
used to calculate the lifetime of the metastable state. If
we consider only the more recent publications, the val-
ues still span over more than 20% of the average lifetime
value. Since 1999, experimental measurements are con-
verging towards a value around 1100 ms. Usually, life-
times are given with a 1σ error bar, which corresponds to
a poor conﬁdence level. We have plotted the most recent
measurements with a 2σ error bar standing for a 95%
conﬁdence level (see inset on ﬁgure 6). Values obtained
in the storage ring [19] suﬀer from a strong collisional
background and exhibit thus the largest error bars. The
other values have been obtained on laser-cooled single
ions in linear and spherical traps. In the ﬁgure, a graph-
ical distinction has been made between values obtained
by a least-squares ﬁt of the exponential decay curve or
maximum likelihood estimates. Comparing our values for
the quantum jump experiments (QJ-lsf and QJ-mle), it
can be seen, that the discrepancy in absolute values could

only be due to the evaluation method used to process the
data. In general, the overlap of the recent experimental
results is very good, and in particular, the agreement
of our value with the one from the ˚Aarhus group [21]
is excellent. The all-over precision of the experimental
determination of the metastable lifetime measurement is
very high, making the Ca+-ion an ideal candidate for the
comparison with theoretical models.

In conclusion, we have measured the lifetime of the
metastable state to a 1.5%-level. Measurement of the
3d2D3/2-level lifetime would be interesting to allow di-
rect comparison of the ﬁne-structure levels. The actual
experimental protocol does not allow such a measurement
due to the coupling by the repumper laser. A comparable
metastable-level lifetime has been measured in the Ba+-
ion [30]. We plan to apply this latter technique for the
measurement of the 3D3/2 lifetime in Ca+.

8

The high degree of control of our experimental parame-
ters, that we need for the preparation of the metrological
project, has now been achieved . The next step will be
the localization of the ion in the trap to better than a
fraction of the emitted wavelength, giving access to the
Lamb-Dicke regime, where the ﬁrst-order Doppler broad-
ening can be eliminated [31]. Stabilization of the clock
laser to an ULE cavity will be required to make the laser
linewidth compatible with the observed ion features.

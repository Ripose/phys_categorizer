We have performed calculations of the size of the frequency shift induced by a static electric ﬁeld
on the clock transition frequencies of the hyperﬁne splitting in Yb+, Rb, Cs, Ba+, and Hg+. The
calculations are used to ﬁnd the frequency shifts due to blackbody radiation which are needed for
accurate frequency measurements and improvements of the limits on variation of the ﬁne structure
constant, α.

INTRODUCTION

Atomic clocks are now important for both practical
applications and fundamental physics. One of the domi-
nant uncertainties in high-precision measurements of fre-
quencies in atomic clocks is the ac stark shift induced
[1]). We perform ac-
by blackbody radiation (see e.g.
curate calculations of the shift due to blackbody radia-
tion in hyperﬁne transitions in Yb+, Rb, Cs, Ba+, and
Hg+. These transitions play key roles in microwave fre-
quency standards. They are also of interest to physicists
considering experiments to measure α variation in the
laboratory (see e.g.
[2, 3, 4, 5]). An experiment is cur-
rently planned utilizing Yb+ [6]. No accurate calcula-
tions or measurements of the radiation shift for this ion
have been performed previously. However, calculations
or measurements are available for some other atoms and
ions [1, 7, 8, 9, 10]. We compare our results with these
values.

This electric ﬁeld causes temperature-dependent fre-
quency shift of the atomic microwave clock transitions.
The lowest-order eﬀect is linear in hyperﬁne interaction
and quadratic in electric ﬁeld. Therefore, its value can
be calculated using third-order perturbation theory (see,
e.g. [11])

where α is the Dirac matrix, µ is the magnetic moment
of the nucleus and rN is nuclear radius.

To get the eﬀect of electric ﬁeld on the frequency of the
hyperﬁne transition one needs to go through the following
steps:

Substitute the perturbation operator ˆV into equa-
tion (3).

Keep only terms linear in ˆHhf s and quadratic in
the electric ﬁeld.

Apply equation (3) to both components of the hy-
perﬁne structure doublet.

Take the diﬀerence.

The resulting expression for the frequency shift consists
of three terms. The ﬁrst two of them originate from ﬁrst
term of equation (3). In one of them the ˆHhf s operator
is either on the left or right side of the expression (these
two terms are equal and can be combined together), and
in the other the ˆHhf s operator is in the middle. The last
term is due to change of the normalization of the wave
function (second term of equation (3)). It is proportional
to the hyperﬁne structure of the ground state.

After angular reduction these three terms become

III. CALCULATIONS

In order to calculate frequency shift to the hfs transi-
tions due to the electric ﬁeld one needs to have a complete
set of states and know the energies, electric dipole transi-
tion amplitudes and hyperﬁne structure matrix elements
corresponding to these states. It is possible to consider
summation over the physical states and use experimen-
tal data to perform the calculations. The lowest valence
states for which experimental data is usually available
strongly dominate in the summation. Oﬀ-diagonal hfs
matrix elements can be obtained to a high accuracy as
the square root of the product of corresponding hfs con-
stants: Am,n = √AmAn (see, e.g. [12]). However, the
accuracy of this approach is limited by the need to in-
clude tail contribution from highly excited states includ-
ing states in the continuum. This contribution can be as
large as several percent of the sum and its calculation is
not easier than the calculation of the whole sum. Also,
for atoms like Yb+ and Hg+ available experimental data
is insuﬃcient to follow this path.

Therefore, in the present work we use an ab initio ap-
proach in which high accuracy is achieved by the inclu-
sion of all important many-body and relativistic eﬀects.
We make only one exception towards the semiempiri-
cal approach. The frequency shift is dominated by the
term (7) which is proportional to the hfs in the ground
state. These hfs constants are known to very high ac-
curacy from measurements for all atoms considered in
the present work. It is natural to use experimental hfs
constants in the dominating term to have more accurate
results. It is also instructive to perform calculations of
the hfs in the ground state to demonstrate the accuracy
of the method.

Calculations start from the relativistic Hartree-Fock
(RHF) method in the V N −1 approximation. This means

2

that the initial RHF procedure is done for a closed-shell
atomic core with the valence electron removed. After
that, states of the external electron are calculated in the
ﬁeld of the frozen core. Correlations are included by
means of the correlation potential method [13]. We use
two diﬀerent approximations for the correlation poten-
tial, ˆΣ. First, we calculate it in the lowest, second-order
of the many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). We use
notation ˆΣ(2) for the corresponding correlation potential.
Then we also include into ˆΣ two classes of the higher-
order terms: screening of the Coulomb interaction and
hole-particle interaction (see, e.g. [14] for details). These
two eﬀects are included in all orders of the MBPT and
the corresponding correlation potential is named ˆΣ(∞).
To calculate ˆΣ(2) we need a complete set of single-
electron orbitals. We use the B-spline technique [15, 16]
to construct the basis. The orbitals are built as linear
combinations of 50 B-splines in a cavity of radius 40aB.
The coeﬃcients are chosen from the condition that the
orbitals are eigenstates of the RHF Hamiltonian ˆH0 of the
closed-shell core. The ˆΣ(∞) operator is calculated with
the technique which combines solving equations for the
Green functions (for the direct diagram) with the summa-
tion over complete set of states (exchange diagram) [14].
The correlation potential ˆΣ is then used to build a new
set of single-electron states, the so-called Brueckner or-
bitals. This set is to be used in the summation in equa-
tions (5), (6) and (7). Here again we use the B-spline
technique to build the basis. The procedure is very sim-
ilar to constructing of the RHF B-spline basis. The only
diﬀerence is that new orbitals are now the eigenstates of
the ˆH0 + ˆΣ Hamiltonian, where ˆΣ is either ˆΣ(2) or ˆΣ(∞).
We use the all-order correlation potential ˆΣ(∞) for Rb,
Cs and Ba+. It has been demonstrated in a number of
works (see, e.g. [14, 17, 18]) that inclusion of the screen-
ing of Coulomb interaction and the hole-particle interac-
tion leads to very accurate results for alkali atoms. How-
ever, for other atoms with one external electron above
closed shells these two higher-order eﬀects are not domi-
nating and their inclusion generally does not improve the
results. Therefore, for the Yb+ and Hg+ ions we use only
the second-order correlation potential ˆΣ(2).

Brueckner orbitals which correspond to the lowest va-
lence states are good approximations to the real physical
states. Their quality can be checked by comparing exper-
imental and theoretical energies. Moreover, their quality
can be further improved by rescaling the correlation po-
tential ˆΣ to ﬁt experimental energies exactly. We do this
by replacing the ˆH0 + ˆΣ with the ˆH0 +λ ˆΣ Hamiltonian in
which the rescaling parameter λ is chosen for each par-
tial wave to ﬁt the energy of the ﬁrst valence state. The
values of λ are presented in Table I. Note that all values
are very close to unity. This means that even without
rescaling the accuracy is very good and only a small ad-
justment of the value of ˆΣ is needed. Note also that since
the rescaling procedure aﬀects not only energies but also
the wave function, it usually leads to improved values of
In fact, this is
the matrix elements of external ﬁelds.

correlation corrections.

Matrix elements of the hfs and electric dipole opera-
tors are found by means of the time-dependent Hartree-
Fock (TDHF) method [13, 19]. This method is equivalent
to the well-known random-phase approximation (RPA).

The best results are achieved when ψn and ψm are

We use equation (9) for all hfs and electric dipole ma-
trix elements in (5), (6), and (7) except for the ground
state hfs matrix element in (7) where we use experimental
data.

The accuracy of the calculations for energy levels and
electric dipole matrix elements is usually better than that
for hyperﬁne structure (see, e.g. [13, 14, 17, 18]). There-
fore, to check the accuracy we perform more detailed cal-
culations of the hfs constants of the ground state. Here
we also include two smaller contributions: structure radi-
ation and correction due to change of the normalization
of the wave function. The structure radiation term can

ing to the ground state of the atom or ion, calculated
with the rescaled correlation potential ˆΣ. All-order ˆΣ(∞)
is used for Rb, Cs and Ba+. Second-order ˆΣ(2) is used
for Yb+ and Hg+. Comparing the ﬁnal theoretical results
with the experiment shows that the theoretical accuracy
is within 1% for all atoms except Hg+ where it is 1.6%. If
the structure radiation and normalization are neglected,
accuracy for Rb and Cs remains within 1%, accuracy for
Ba+ becomes about 2% and accuracy for Yb+ and Hg+
becomes close to 5%. This can also serve as an estimation
of theoretical accuracy for the frequency shift.

Table III presents contributions of terms (5), (6) and
(7) into the total frequency shift of the hfs transitions for
the ground states of 87Rb, 133Cs, 137Ba+, 171Yb+ and
199Hg+ calculated in diﬀerent approximations. Term (7)
dominates in all cases, while term (6) is small but still
important at least for Rb, Cs and Ba+. Results obtained
with ˆΣ(2) and ˆΣ(∞) diﬀer signiﬁcantly (up to 14% for
Cs). However, after rescaling the results for both ˆΣ(2)
and ˆΣ(∞) come within a fraction of a per cent of each
other. Naturally, rescaling has larger eﬀect on results
obtained with ˆΣ(2). This means that the rescaling re-
ally imitates the eﬀect of higher-order correlations and
should lead to more accurate results. Comparing the
results obtained with ˆΣ(∞), rescaled ˆΣ(∞) and rescaled
ˆΣ(2) gives reasonable estimation of the accuracy of cal-
culations. If we also combine this with the calculation

of the hfs discussed above we can safely assume that the
accuracy of the calculations for Rb, Cs and Ba+ is on the
level of 1%. For Yb+ and Hg+ we have only results with
rescaled and not rescaled ˆΣ(2). They diﬀer by about 11%.
However, there are strong reasons to believe that the re-
sults obtained with rescaling are more accurate. This is
supported by calculations for Rb, Cs and Ba+ as well as
our experience with rescaling used in many earlier works.
Therefore, the calculation of the hfs discussed above gives
a more realistic estimation of the accuracy for Yb+ and

4

Hg+ which is about 5%.

The frequency shifts of some alkali metal atoms have
been calculated and measured previously. We present
previous results for the atoms and ions for which we per-
form calculations in Table IV together with our ﬁnal re-
sults. The results are in good agreement with each other.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have performed calculations of the frequency shift
of the ground state hyperﬁne transition for several atoms
and ions caused by a static electric ﬁeld which can be
used to evaluate the eﬀect of blackbody radiation on the
frequency of the microwave atomic clock transitions. The
size of this shift is comparable to the current error in the
measurements of the energy shift caused by variation of
α and so needs to be taken into account in laboratory
measurements placing limits upon α variation.

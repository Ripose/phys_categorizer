We report an accurate measurement of the recoil velocity of 87Rb atoms based on Bloch oscillations
in a vertical accelerated optical lattice. We transfer about 900 recoil momenta with an eﬃciency of
99.97% per recoil. A set of 72 measurements of the recoil velocity, each one with a relative uncertainty
of about 33 ppb in 20 min integration time, leads to a determination of the ﬁne structure constant
α with a statistical relative uncertainty of 4.4 ppb. The detailed analysis of the diﬀerent systematic
errors yields to a relative uncertainty of 6.7 ppb. The deduced value of α−1 is 137.03599878(91).

The ﬁne structure constant α plays an important role
among all the physical constants because it sets the scale
of electromagnetic interactions. Therefore, it can be mea-
sured in diﬀerent ﬁelds of physics and so be used to test
the consistency of the physics. In the Codata adjustment
[1, 2], all accurate known determinations of α are used
to give the best estimate of α (labelled α2002 for 2002
adjustment). But as pointed out in [2], the actual esti-
mate α2002 is only determined by two data and in fact
mainly by the electron magnetic moment anomaly ae ex-
periment. This lack on redundancy in input data is a
key weakness of the Codata adjustment. For example
α2002 diﬀers from α1998 by more than one sigma mainly
because of some revisions in the complicated theoreti-
cal expression of ae from which α is deduced [2]. Accu-
rate determinations of α by completely diﬀerent methods
are absolutely needed. A competitive determination of α
with respect to ae experiment is actually the measure-
ment of the ratio h/mCs (where h is the Planck constant
and mCs is the mass of the Cesium atom) using ultracold
atoms interferometry [3]. The ﬁne structure constant is
related to the ratio h/mX by [4]:

where several terms are known with a very small uncer-

tainty less than 2.0

In this letter, we report a new determination of the
ﬁne structure constant α deduced from the measurement
of the ratio h/mRb based on Bloch oscillations. We de-
scribe an elaborated experimental method to measure ac-
curately the recoil velocity of a Rubidium atom when it
absorbs or emits a photon. The principle of this experi-

ment is already described in a previous paper [8]: by us-
ing velocity-selective Raman transitions, we measure the
variation of the atomic velocity induced by a frequency-
chirped standing wave. This coherent acceleration arises
from a succession of stimulated Raman transitions where
each Raman transition modiﬁes the atomic momentum
by 2~k (k = 2π/λ, λ is the laser wavelength), leaving the
internal state unchanged. The acceleration process can
also be interpreted in terms of Bloch oscillations in the
fundamental energy band of an optical lattice created by
the standing wave (period d = λ/2)[9]: the atomic mo-
mentum evolves by steps of 2~k, each one corresponding
to a Bloch oscillation. After N oscillations, we release
adiabatically the optical lattice and we measure the ﬁnal
velocity distribution which corresponds to the initial one
shifted by 2N vr (vr = ~k/m is the recoil velocity).

The experimental design diﬀers slightly from our prior
setup [8]. Now, the Bloch beams (optical lattice) and the
Raman beams (velocity measurement) are in vertical ge-
ometry (Fig.1). This scheme is more suitable to achieve
a high precision measurement of the recoil velocity, be-
cause it allows us to increase signiﬁcantly the number of
transferred momenta.

An atomic sample of 3

107 Rubidium 87 atoms is

∼

produced in a magneto-optical trap, followed by a σ+
−
σ− optical molasses. The ﬁnal temperature of the cloud
is 3µK, its radius at 1/√e is
600µm and all the atoms
are in the hyperﬁne state F = 2. An optical Zeeman
repumper (resonant with the F = 2, F ′ = 2 transition)
transfers the atoms to the F = 2, mF = 0 hyperﬁne state.
Then, a narrow velocity class is selected to F =
1 , mF = 0 by using a counter-propagating Raman π-
pulse. The non selected atoms are blown away using a
resonant laser beam. After the acceleration process de-
scribed later, the atomic velocity distribution is probed
using a second Raman π-pulse from F=1 to F=2. The
population in both levels is detected using a time of ﬂight
technic [10] (see Fig.1). The Raman beams are produced

by two stabilized laser diodes. Their beat frequency is
precisely controlled by a frequency chain allowing to eas-
ily switch the Raman frequency detuning from the selec-
tion (δsel) to the measurement (δmes). One of the lasers
is stabilized on a highly stable Fabry-Perot cavity and its
frequency is measured by counting the beatnote with a
two-photons Rb standard [11]. In vertical conﬁguration,
the frequency of one Raman beam is linearly swept in or-
der to compensate the Doppler shift induced by the fall
of the atoms (Fig.2) (with the same slope for the selec-
tion and the measurement). The Raman beams power is
8 mW and their waist is 2 mm. To reduce photon scat-
tering and light shifts, they are blue detuned by 1 THz
from the D2 line. The duration of the π pulse is 3.4 ms:
thus, the width of the selected velocity class is vr/50. In
order to reduce the phase noise, the Raman beams fol-
low the same optical path: they come out from the same
ﬁber and one of them is retroreﬂected (Fig.1).

Coherent acceleration. As shown in our previous work
[8], Bloch oscillations of atoms in an optical lattice are
a very eﬃcient tool to transfer a large number of recoil
momenta to the selected atoms in a short time. The op-
tical lattice results from the interference of two counter-
propagating beams generated by a Ti-Sapphire laser,
whose frequency is stabilized on the same Fabry-Perot
cavity used for the Raman beams and is blue detuned by
40 GHz from the one photon transition. The optical
∼
lattice is adiabatically raised in 500 µs in order to load
all the atoms into the ﬁrst Bloch band. To perform the
coherent acceleration, the frequency diﬀerence of the two
beams is swept linearly within 3 ms using acousto-optic
modulators. Then, the lattice intensity is adiabatically
lowered in 500 µs to bring atoms back in a well deﬁned
momentum state. The optical potential depth is 70 Er

size that the scale of the frequency variation is not the same
for the Bloch and the Raman beams

(Er = ~2k2/2m is the recoil energy).

With these parameters the spontaneous emission is
negligible. For an acceleration of 2000 ms−2 we transfer
900 recoil momenta in 3 ms with an eﬃciency of 99.97%
per recoil. To avoid that the atoms reach the upper
windows of the vacuum chamber, we use a double ac-
celeration scheme (see Fig.2): instead of selecting atoms
at rest, we ﬁrst accelerate them using Bloch oscillations
and then we perform the three steps sequence: selection-
acceleration-measurement. In this way the atomic veloc-
ity at the measurement step is close to zero.

In the vertical direction, an accurate determination of
the recoil velocity would require a measurement of the
gravity g. In order to get rid of gravity, we make a dif-
ferential measurement by accelerating the atoms in op-
posite directions (up and down trajectories) keeping the
same delay between the selection and the measurement
π-pulses. The ratio ~/m can then be deduced from

two typical velocity distributions for N up = 430 and
N down = 460. The eﬀective recoil number is then
2(N up + N down) = 1780. The center of each spectrum is
determined with an uncertainty of 1.7 Hz (

the experimental protocol, for each trajectory, the Ra-
man beams directions are reversed leading to the record
of two velocity spectra. When the atoms follow exactly
the same up or down trajectories, these systematic eﬀects
are cancelled by taking the mean value of these two mea-
surements. Finally one determination of α is obtained
from four velocity spectra.

The Fig.4 presents a set of 72 determinations of the ﬁne
structure constant α. Each determination is obtained af-
ter 20 min of integration time. The dispersion of these
n = 72 measurements is χ2/(n

sulting statistical relative uncertainty on α is 4.4 ppb.

—Systematic eﬀects analysis— We detail now all the
diﬀerent systematic eﬀects taken into account to deter-
mine the ﬁnal value of α−1 and its uncertainty.

Laser frequencies: The frequency of the reference
Fabry-Perot cavity on which the Bloch and the Raman
lasers are stabilized is controlled several times during the
20 min measurement. The measured frequency drift is
1 MHz. Thus, we assume a conservative uncertainty of
300 kHz for the absolute determination of the diﬀerent
laser wavelengths, which corresponds to 0.8 ppb on α−1.
Beams alignment : We have measured the ﬁber-ﬁber

3

coupling of the counterpropagating Bloch and Raman
beams.
It varies of less than 10% with respect to the
maximum coupling. That corresponds to a maximum
10−5 rad between the Raman beams
misalignment of 3.1
10−4 rad between the Bloch beams. The max-
and of 1.6
imum systematic eﬀect on α−1 is of
10−9. Thus, we
correct α−1 by (

Wavefront curvature and Gouy phase: As the experi-
mental beams are not plane waves, we have to consider
the phase gradient in (2) instead of wavevectors k. For
a Gaussian beam, the phase gradient along the propaga-
tion axis is

where r is the radial distance from the propagation axis,
w(z) is the beam radius and R(z) = z(1 + (zr/z)2) is the
curvature radius. The ﬁrst corrective term (Gouy phase)
originates from the spread on the transverse momenta,
which is inversely proportional to the beam transverse
spatial conﬁnement. The second term comes from the
spatial variation of the phase due to the curvature ra-
dius. We have measured w(z) and R(z) with a wavefront
analyser. The correction on α−1 is (
4) ppb. This
is our dominant systematic eﬀect.

Magnetic ﬁeld : Residual magnetic ﬁeld gradients con-
tribute to the systematics in two ways. Firstly there is a
second order Zeeman shift of the energy levels which in-
duces an error in the Raman velocity measurement. Sec-
ondly, the quadratic magnetic force modiﬁes the atomic
motion between the selection and the measurement. We
have precisely measured the spatial magnetic ﬁeld varia-
tions using copropagating Raman transitions. The Zee-
man level shift is not totally compensated by changing
the direction of the Raman beams because the two up (or
down) trajectories are not completely identical. They
diﬀer by about 300 µm, leading to a diﬀerential level

shift of about (0.3

Gravity gradient : Gravity is not totally compensated
between up and down trajectories because they diﬀer by
about 10 cm. The correction on α−1 is (0.18
0.02) ppb.
Light shifts: In principle, light shifts are compensated
in three ways: between the selection and the measure-
ment Raman pulses, between the upward and down-
ward trajectories and when the Raman beams direction
is changed. However this eﬀect is not totally cancelled.
This is ﬁrstly due to a diﬀerent intensity at the selec-
tion and at the measurement because of the expansion
of the cloud, secondly to spatial intensity gradient along
the beams, and thirdly to intensity variations between
the two Raman conﬁgurations. We calculate an eﬀect of
0.2 ppb on α−1. There is also a two-photon
less than
light shift due to the copropagating Raman beams com-

We emphasize that the eﬀect of the refractive index of
the cold cloud is diﬀerent than the eﬀect of the back-
ground vapor refractive index. Especially, we have to
take into account the motion of the dispersive media (cold
cloud) in the global momentum conservation and in the
Doppler eﬀect. Indeed, in the case of the Bloch beams,
the accelerated cloud is itself the dispersive media. If one
has a 100% transfer eﬃciency, the momentum conserva-
tion seems to indicate that the refractive index of the
cloud does not modify the recoil momentum transferred
to the atoms. In our experiment, we have a 99.95% eﬃ-
ciency per Bloch oscillation, which would correspond to
a modiﬁcation of the atomic recoil momentum of about
5
1), leading to a negligible eﬀect. Let us
now consider the Doppler eﬀect of an atom moving at
the average velocity of the cloud, during a Raman pulse:
in the frame of the cloud the length of the optical path
is constant with time, so the Doppler eﬀect is indepen-
dent from the refractive index of the cloud. However,
there is a small eﬀect due to the atomic recoil. It would
lead to an eﬀect on the recoil measurement of the order
of (n
1)/N (where N is the number of Bloch oscilla-
tions), which is also negligible. A deeply detailed study
is in progress. Finally, we have adopted for the refractive
index eﬀect due to the cold cloud a conservative uncer-
tainty of 3

tions (> 99.97% per recoil), we are able to transfer 900
photon momenta. To our knowledge, this is the high-
est number of recoils ever transferred coherently to any
physical system. Our non interferometric measurement
achieves a precision comparable to the best interferomet-
ric measurement [3]. An even more rigorous control of
some systematics will be undertaken to reduce the un-
certainty on a future determination of α.

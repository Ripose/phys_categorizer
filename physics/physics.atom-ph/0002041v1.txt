We propose an experiment that would demonstrate the
“dc” and “ac” Josephson eﬀects in two weakly linked Bose-
Einstein condensates. We consider a time-dependent barrier,
moving adiabatically across the trapping potential. The phase
dynamics are governed by a “driven-pendulum” equation, as
in current-driven superconducting Josephson junctions. At
a critical velocity of the barrier (proportional to the critical
tunneling current), there is a sharp transition between the
“dc” and “ac” regimes. The signature is a sudden jump of a
large fraction of the relative condensate population. Analyti-
cal predictions are compared with a full numerical solution of
the time dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, in an experi-
mentally realistic situation.

The Josephson eﬀects (JE’s) are a paradigm of the
phase coherence manifestation in a macroscopic quan-
tum system [1–3]. Observed early on in superconduc-
tors [2], JE’s have been demonstrated in two weakly
linked superﬂuid 3He-B reservoirs [4]. Weakly interacting
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) gases [5] provide a fur-
ther (and diﬀerent) context for JE’s. Indeed, magnetic
and optical traps can be tailored and biased (by time-
dependent external probes) with high accuracy [6–8], al-
lowing the investigation of dynamical regimes that might
not be accessible with other superconducting/superﬂuid
systems. The macroscopic BEC’s coherence has been
demonstrated by interference experiments [6,7], and the
ﬁrst evidence of coherent tunneling in an atomic array,
related to the “ac” JE, has been recently reported [8].

A superconducting Josephson junction (SJJ) is usu-
ally biased by an external circuit that typically includes
a current drive Iext. The striking signatures of the
Josephson eﬀects in SJJ are contained in the voltage-
current characteristic (V -Iext), where usually one can
distinguish between the superconductive branch or “dc”-
branch (V = 0, Iext 6= 0), and the resistive branch or
“ac”-branch (V ≈ R Iext) (see for example [2]). Exter-
nal circuits and current sources are absent in two weakly
linked Bose condensates and the Josephson eﬀects have
been related, so far, with coherent density oscillations be-
tween condensates in two traps or between condensates
in two diﬀerent hyperﬁne levels [9–14]. This collective
dynamical behavior is described by a non-rigid pendu-
lum equation [9], predicting a new class of phenomena
not observable with SJJ’s.

Now the following question arises: can two weakly

linked condensates exhibit the analog of the voltage-
current characteristic in SJJ? Although BECs are obvi-
ously neutral, the answer is positive. A dc current-biased
SJJ can be simulated by considering a tunneling barrier
moving with constant velocity across the trap. At a crit-
ical velocity of the barrier a sharp transition between
the “dc” and “ac” (boson) Josephson regimes occurs.
This transition is associated with a macroscopic jump
in the population diﬀerence, that can be easily moni-
tored experimentally by destructive or non-destructive
techniques.

In the following we will brieﬂy introduce the phe-
nomenological equations of the resistively shunted junc-
tion (RSJ) model for the SJJ. We will describe the cor-
responding experiment for two weakly linked BECs and
show that the relevant equations are formally equivalent
to the RSJ equations. Then we compare the analytical re-
sults with a numerical integration of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation in a realistic 3D setup.

In the RSJ model, SJJ is described by an equivalent

circuit [2] in which the current balance equation is

Ic sin(θ) + G V + C ˙V = Iext

(1)

where Ic is the upper bound of the Josephson supercur-
rent I (which is represented, in the ideal case, by the
sinusoidal current-phase relation I = Ic sin(θ)); G is an
eﬀective conductance (oﬀered by the quasiparticles and
the circuit shunt resistor), and C is the junction capac-
itance. The voltage diﬀerence V across the junction is
related to the relative phase θ by

˙θ = 2eV /¯h .

(2)

In the low conductance limit G ≪ ωp C where ωp =
p2eIc/¯hC is the Josephson plasma frequency, combining
equations (1) and (2) leads to the “driven pendulum”
equation

where U is the tilted “washboard” potential:

with i = Iext/Ic. This equation describes the tran-
sient behavior before the stationary dissipative behavior
is reached (resistive branch).
If we start from equilib-
rium, with i = 0, and increase adiabatically the current,

no voltage drop develops until the critical value i = 1 is
reached (neglecting secondary quantum eﬀects). At this
point V continuously develops until a stationary asymp-
totic dissipative behavior is reached in a time scale ap-
proximately of order C/G. Similar phenomenology may
occur in BECs and we will derive equations formally iden-
tical to Equations (3) and (4).

A weak link between two condensates can be created
by focusing a blue-detuned far-oﬀ-resonant laser sheet
into the center of the magnetic trap [6]. The weak link
can be tailored by tuning the width and/or the height of
the laser sheet. Raman transitions between two conden-
sates in diﬀerent hyperﬁne levels provide a diﬀerent weak
link [7], in analogy with the “internal Josephson eﬀect”
observed in 70s with 3He − A [15].
Here we consider a double well potential in which the
laser sheet slowly moves across the magnetic trap with
velocity v (but our framework can be easily adapted to
investigate the internal Josephson eﬀect). In the limit of
very low v, the two condensates remain in equilibrium,
i.e.
in their instantaneous ground state, because of the
non-zero tunneling current that can be supported by the
barrier. In fact, an average net current, proportional to
the velocity of the laser sheet, ﬂows through the barrier,
sustained by a constant relative phase between the two
condensates. This keeps the chemical potential diﬀerence
between the two subsystems locked to zero, as in the
SJJ dc-branch. However, the superﬂuid component of
the current ﬂowing through the barrier is bounded by a
critical value Ic. As a consequence there exists a critical
velocity vc, above which a non-zero chemical potential
diﬀerence develops across the junction. This regime is
characterized by a running-phase mode, and provides the
analog of the ac-branch in SJJ’s.

The ”dc” and ”ac” BEC regimes are governed by a
phase-equation similar to the current-driven pendulum
equations (3) and (4). Such equations together with the
sinusoidal current-phase relation I = Ic sin(θ) describe
the phase diﬀerence and current dynamics. The dimen-
sionless current i is related to the barrier velocity by

i = v / vc

with the critical velocity vc given by

vc =

where F is to a good approximation represented by dou-
ble the average force exerted by the magnetic trap on
single atoms in one well.

Equations (3)-(6) can be derived by a time-dependent
variational approximation and have also been veriﬁed, as
we discuss below, by the full numerical integration [18] of
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) [16,17]. The GPE
describes the collective dynamics of a dilute Bose gas at
zero temperature:

with N the total number of atoms. The external po-
tential is given by the magnetic trap and the laser bar-
rier Vext (r, t) = Vtrap (r) + Vlaser (z, t). We consider
a harmonic, cylindrically symmetric trap Vtrap (r) =

and longitudinal frequency, respectively. The barrier is

The equations (3) to (6) can be derived by solv-

ative population η = (N2 − N1)/N and phase θ = θ2 − θ1

scheme between the low interacting limit N 2Ec ≪ EJ

with η ≪ 1, we recover the driven-pendulum phase equa-
tion (3) and the critical velocity relations (5) and (6) with
¯hωp = √EJ Ec. In particular, it is legitimate to consider
the Josephson coupling as a perturbation, with the the
phase dynamics entirely determined by the diﬀerence in
the chemical potentials µ1(N1, lz) and µ2(N2, lz) in the
two wells. In this case Ec corresponds to 2 (∂µ1/∂N1)lz

We make the comparison of Eqs. (8) and (9) with a full
numerical integration of the GPE in an experimentally
realistic geometry relative to the limit N 2Ec ≫ EJ . In
particular, we show that Eq.
(6), derived in the limit
of η ≪ 1, still remains a good approximation even for
η ≈ 0.4. The details of the numerical calculation are
given elsewhere [18].
We have considered the JILA setup, with N = 5× 104
Rb atoms in a cylindrically symmetric harmonic trap,
having the longitudinal frequency ω0 = 50 s−1 and the
radial frequency ωr = 17.68 s−1. The value of the scatter-
ing length considered is a = 58.19 ˙A. A Gaussian shaped
laser sheet is focused in the center of the trap, cutting it
into two parts. We assume that the (longitudinal) 1/e2
half-width of the laser barrier is 3.5 µm and the barrier
height V0/¯h = 650 s−1.

Although the lifetime of a trapped condensate can be
as long as minutes, we have made a quite conservative
choice, by considering a time scale on the order of one sec-
ond. The possibility to perform experiments on a longer
time-scale will improve the observability of the phenom-
ena we are discussing. With this choice of time scale,
that corresponds only to few plasma oscillations, an adi-
abatic increase of the velocity is not possible, therefore
we proceed as follows. For t < 0 the laser is at rest in the
middle of the trap, lz = 0, and the two condensates are
in equilibrium. For t > 0 the laser moves across the trap,
with constant velocity, and the relative atomic popula-
tion is observed at tf = 1 s. With this initial condition,
which introduces small plasma oscillations in the rela-
tive population, it is expected, in absence of dissipation,
to slightly reduce the critical current by the numerical
factor ≈ 0.725 (see the general properties of the driven
pendulum equation [2]).
In Fig.1 we show the relative condensate population
η = (N2 − N1)/N , calculated after 1 second, for diﬀer-
ent values of the laser velocity v. The crosses are the
results obtained with the full numerical integration of
the time-dependent GPE (7). The dot-dashed line shows

the equilibrium values ηeq of the relative population cal-
culated with the stationary GPE and with the laser at
rest in the ”ﬁnal” position lz = v tf . The displacement
of η(tf ) from ηeq is a measure of the chemical potential
diﬀerence, being ∆µ = µ2 − µ1 ≈ N Ec(η(tf ) − ηeq)/2.
For v < 0.42 µm/s, the atoms tunnel through the bar-
rier in order to keep the chemical potential diﬀerence
∆µ locked around zero. The dc component of the tun-
neling current is accounted for by an averaged constant
phase diﬀerence between the two condensates. This is the
close analog of the dc Josephson eﬀect in superconduct-
ing Josephson junctions. The small deviations between
the dashed line and the crosses are due to the presence
of plasma oscillations (induced by our initial condition).
At v ≈ 0.42 µm/s there is a sharp transition, connected
with the crossover from the dc-branch to the ac-branch
in SJJ. For v > 0.42 µm/s, the phase diﬀerence starts
running and the population diﬀerence, after a transient
time, remains on average ﬁxed. A macroscopic chemical
potential diﬀerence is established across the junction. In
this regime ac oscillations in the population diﬀerence are
observed. The frequency of such oscillations are approx-
imatively given by ∆µ(t)/¯h (not visible in the ﬁgure).

FIG. 1. Fractional population imbalance versus the veloc-
ity of the laser creating the weak link. A sharp transition
between the ”dc” and the ”ac” branches occurs at a bar-
rier critical velocity. The solid line and the crosses are the
analytical and the numerical calculations, respectively. The
dashed-dot line represents the static equilibrium value ηeq cal-
culated with the center of the laser at v tf .

The solid line of Fig.1 corresponds to the solutions of
Eqs. (8) and (9) in which the value of the energy integrals
EcN/¯h = 2.46 ms−1 and EJ /N ¯h = 2.41 × 10−4 ms−1
are chosen in order to give the correct value of ωp =
2.44 × 10−2 ms−1 and Ic = 12.1 ms−1. The val-
ues ωp, Ic are calculated numerically studying the fre-
quency of small oscillations around equilibrium and the
current-phase relation, respectively. The force integral is

3

F/¯h = 1.060 ms−1 µm−1. The parameters ωp, Ic and F
are calculated with the laser at rest (v = 0) in lz = 0.
Using these values in Eq. (6) and taking into account the
reducing factor 0.725 we obtain the value 0.407 µm s−1
for the critical velocity, in agreement with the value ob-
served in the simulation.

Small deviations between the variational solutions (full
line in Fig.1) and the numerical results (crosses in Fig.1),
above the critical velocity, are due to “level-crossing” ef-
fects. Numerical results [18] show that when the con-
densate ground state of the “upper” well is aligned with
the excited collective dipole state in the “lower” well,
a ﬁnite number of atoms go from the “upper” well to
the “lower” well. Close to this tunneling resonance it is
possible to control, by manipulating the barrier veloc-
ity below a fraction of vc, the dc ﬂux of atoms from the
ground state condensate in the “upper” well to the longi-
tudinal intrawell collective dipole mode of the condensate
in the “lower” well. This eﬀect is directly observable in
the macroscopic longitudinal oscillations of the two con-
densates (at frequencies ≈ ω0).
Concerning a possible realization of the phenomenon
described in this work, we note that for small barrier
velocities v, the motion of the laser sheet with respect
to the magnetic trap with velocity v or, viceversa, the
motion of the magnetic trap with velocity −v, are equiv-
alent, there being negligible corrections due to diﬀerent
initial accelerations.

Thus far we have discussed the zero temperature limit.
At ﬁnite temperature dissipation can arise due to inco-
herent exchange of thermal atoms between the two wells.
This can be described phenomenologically by including a
term −EcG ˙θ/ω2
p in Eq. (3) where G is the conductance.
Dissipation will be negligible as long as the characteristic
time scale (EcG)−1 ≈ (20G/¯h) s is bigger than the time
scale of the experiment (≈ 1s).
To conclude we note that while it could be diﬃcult
to measure directly the plasma oscillations, since their
amplitude is limited by ∆η < 4
, the macroscopic
change in the population diﬀerence may be easily de-
tected with standard techniques. Moreover the frame-
work that we have discussed can be easily adapted to
investigate the internal Josephson eﬀect.

Our phenomenological equations are similar to the
driven pendulum equation governing the Josephson ef-
fects in SJJs. As a consequence, within this framework
we can study the “secondary quantum phenomena”, such
as the Macroscopic Quantum Tunneling between diﬀer-
ent local minima of the washboard potential (see for in-
stance [19]).

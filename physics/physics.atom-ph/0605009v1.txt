excited and ground states in nickel-like ions

A relativistic many-body method is developed to calculate energy and transition rates for mul-
tipole transitions in many-electron ions. This method is based on relativistic many-body pertur-
bation theory (RMBPT), agrees with MCDF calculations in lowest-order, includes all second-order
correlation corrections and includes corrections from negative energy states. Reduced matrix ele-
ments, oscillator strengths, and transition rates are calculated for electric-multipole (dipole (E1),
quadrupole (E2), and octupole (E3)) and magnetic-multipole (dipole (M1), quadrupole (M2), and
octupole (M3)) transitions between 3l
excited and ground states in Ni-like ions with nuclear
charges ranging from Z = 30 to 100. The calculations start from a 1s22s22p63s23p63d10 Dirac-Fock
potential. First-order perturbation theory is used to obtain intermediate-coupling coeﬃcients, and
second-order RMBPT is used to determine the matrix elements. A detailed discussion of the various
contributions to the dipole matrix elements and energy levels is given for nickellike tungsten (Z =
74). The contributions from negative-energy states are included in the second-order E1, M1, E2 M2,
E3, and M3 matrix elements. The resulting transition energies and transition rates are compared
with experimental values and with results from other recent calculations. These atomic data are
important in modeling of M-shell radiation spectra of heavy ions generated in electron beam ion
trap experiments and in M-shell diagnostics of plasmas.

INTRODUCTION

The Ni-isoelectronic sequence has been studied extensively in connection with x-ray lasers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11]. Recently, an investigation into the use of atomic databases in simulation of Ni-like gadolinium x-ray laser was
presented by King et al. in Ref. [12]. Measurements of 3d − 5f and 3d − 6f transition energies in Ni-like ions (Ag19+,
Sn22+, Pr31+, Gd36+, Yb42+, Ta45+, Ir49+, Th62+, and , U64+) were reported by Elliott et al. in Ref. [13]. Additional
measurements of the 3d5/2 − 6f7/2 transition energies in Ni-like Tm41+, Hf44+, Re47+, Pb54+, and Th62+ were carried
out by Beiersdorfer in Ref. [14]. Recently, the x-ray spectral measurements of the line emission of n = 3–4, 3–5, 3–6,
and 3–7 transitions in Ni- to Kr-like Au ions in electron beam trap (EBIT) plasma were reported by May et al. in
Ref. [15]. X-ray spectra of Ni-like W including 3-4, 5, and 6 transitions recorded by a broadband microcalorimeter,
were analyzed in Ref. [16, 17]. A detailed analysis of 3-4 and 3-5 transitions in the x-ray spectrum by laser produced
plasmas of Ni-like highly-charged ions was presented by Doron et al. [18] (Ba28+), by Zigler et al. [19] (La29+ and
Pr31+), by Doron et al. [20] (Ce30+). Studies of Ni-like ions (Gd36+, W46+ have also been carried out on tokamaks
[21, 22].

Various computer codes were employed to calculate transitions in Ni-like ions. In particular, ab-initio calculations
were performed in Ref. [18] using the relac relativistic computer code to identify 3d − nf (n=4 to 8) transitions
of Ni-like Ba. Atomic structure calculations for highly ionized tungsten (Co-like W47+ to Rb-like W37+) were done
by Fournier [23] with using the graphical angular momentum coupling code ANGULAR and the fully relativistic
parametric potential code RELAC. The Hebrew University Lawrence Livermore Atomic Code hullac is also based
on a relativistic model potential [24]. Ab-initio calculations with the hullac relativistic code was used for detailed
analysis of spectral lines by by Zigler et al. [19] and by May et al. in Ref. [15]. Zhang et al. [25], using the Dirac-Fock-
Slater (DFS) code evaluated excitation energies and oscillator strengths of 3-4 and 3-5 transitions for the 33 Ni-like
ions with 60≤ Z ≥92. The multiconﬁguration Dirac=Fock calculations of the 3d3/2−5f5/2, 3d5/2−5f7/2, 3d3/2−6f5/2,
and 3d5/2 − 6f7/2 transitions were reported by Elliot et al.
in Ref. [13]. The wavelengths and transition rates for
3l − nl′ electric-dipole transitions in Ni-like xenon are presented by Skobelev et al. in Ref. [26]. Results were obtained
by three methods: the relativistic Hartree-Fock (HFR) self-consistent-ﬁeld method (Cowan code), multiconﬁguration
Dirac=-Fock (MCDH) method (Grant code), and the hullac code. The contribution of lots of weak correlation on
transition wavelengths and probabilities by including partly single and double excitation from the 3l inner-shells into
the 4l and 5l orbital layers of highly-charged Ni-like ions were discussed by Dong et al. in Ref. [27]. Energy levels,
transition probabilities, and electron impact excitation for possible x-ray line emissions of Ni-like tantalum ions were
recently calculated by Zhong et al. in Ref. [28].

decay rates calculated by the MCDF approach, were presented by Bi´emont [29] for lowest 17 levels of highly ionized
nickel-like ions. Observation of electric-quadrupole (E2) and magnetic-octupole (M3) decay in the x-ray spectrum of
highly charged Ni-like ions (Th62+ and U64+) were reported by Beiersdorfer et al. in Ref. [30]. The lowest excited
level in Ni-like ions, 3d94d 3D3, decays only via an M3 decay. The radiative decay of this line was measured recently
in Xe26+, Cs27+, and XBa28+ by Tr¨abert et al.
[31, 32]. Calculated values of transitions wavelengths and rates for
Ni-like ions with 30≤ Z ≤100 presented in Ref. [32] were obtained by using Relativistic Many-Body Perturbation
Theory (RMBPT) method. Reduced matrix elements, oscillator strengths, and transition rates into the ground state
for all allowed and forbidden electric- and magnetic-dipole and electric- and magnetic-quadrupole transitions (E1,
M1, E2, M2) in Ni-like ions were presented by Hamasha et al. in Ref. [33]. Relativistic many-body calculations of
multipole (E1, M1, E2, M2, E3, M3) transition wavelengths and rates between 3l−14l′ excited and ground states in
nickel-like ions were recently reported by Safronova et al. in Ref. [34].

In the present paper, RMBPT is used for systematic study of atomic characteristics of transitions in Ni=like
ions in a broad range of the nuclear charge Z = 3–100. Speciﬁcally, we determine energies of 3s23p63d95l(J),
3s23p53d105l(J), and 3s3p63d105l(J) states of Ni-like ions with nuclear charges Z=30-100. The calculations are
carried out to second order in perturbation theory. We consider all possible 3l holes and 5l particles leading to the 67
odd-parity 3d−15p(J), 3d−15f (J), 3p−15s(J), 3p−15d(J), 3p−15g(J), 3s−15p(J), and 3s−15f (J) excited states and
the 74 even-parity 3d−15s(J), 3d−15d(J), 3d−15g(J), 3p−15p(J), 3p−15f (J), 3s−15s(J), 3s−15d(J) and 3s−15g(J)
excited states in Ni-like ions with Z=30 to 100.

RMBPT is also used to determine line strengths, oscillator strengths, and transition rates for all allowed and
forbidden electric-multipole and magnetic-multipole (E1, E2, E3, M1, M2, M3) from 3s23p63d95l(J), 3s23p53d105l(J),
and 3s3p63d105l(J) excited states into the ground state in Ni-like ions. Retarded E1, E2, and E3 matrix elements are
evaluated in both length and velocity forms. A detailed discussion of the various contributions to the dipole matrix
elements and energy levels is given for nickellike tungsten (Z = 74), which plays an important role in tokamaks
[21, 22], electron beam ion traps [17, 35, 36], x-ray lasers [37], and z-pinches [16].

II. METHOD

Details of the RMBPT method were presented in Refs. [38, 39] for calculation of energies of hole-particle states, in
Ref. [40] for calculation of energies of particle-particle states, in Ref. [41] for calculation of radiative electric-dipole rates
in two-particle states, and in Ref. [33, 42] for calculation of radiative electric-dipole, electric-quadrupole, magnetic-
dipole, and magnetic-quadrupole rates in Ne- and Ni-like systems. We will present here only the model space for
Ni-like ions without repeating the detailed discussions given in [38, 39], [40],[41], and [33, 42]. The calculations are
carried out using sets of basis Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) orbitals. The orbitals used in the present calculation are
obtained as linear combinations of B-splines. These B-spline basis orbitals are determined using the method described
in Ref. [43]. We use 50 B-splines of order 10 for each single-particle angular momentum state and we include all orbitals

For atoms with one hole in closed shells and one electron above closed shells, the model space is formed from

hole-particle states of the type a+
3/2
ground state. The single-particle indices v range over states in the valence shell and the single-hole indices a range
over the closed core. For our study of low-lying states 3l−14l′ states of Ni-like ions, values of a are 3s1/2, 3p1/2, 3p3/2,
3d3/2, and 3d5/2,while values of v are 5s1/2, 5p1/2, 5p3/2, 5d3/2, 5d5/2 5f5/2, 5f7/2, 5g7/2, and 5g9/2. To obtain an
orthonormal model states, we consider the coupled states ΦJM (av) deﬁned by

Combining the n = 3 hole orbitals and the n = 4 particle orbitals in nickel, we obtain 68 odd-parity states consisting
of 5 J = 0 states, 13 J = 1 states, 16 J = 2 states, 15 J = 3 states, 11 J = 4 states, six J = 5 states, and two J = 6
states. Additionally, there are 74 even-parity states consisting of 5 J = 0 states, 13 J = 1 states, 17 J = 2 states,
16 J = 3 states, 12 J = 4 states, seven J = 5 states, three J = 6 states, and one J = 7 state. The distribution of
the 142 states in the model space is summarized in Table I. In this table, we give both jj and LS designations for
hole-particle states. Instead of using the 3l−1

2 . The one-body second-order energy is obtained as a sum of the valence E(2)

In Table II, we give various contributions to the second-order energies for the special case of Ni-like tungsten,
Z = 74. In this table, we show the one-body and two-body second-order Coulomb contributions to the energy matrix
labeled E(2)
2 , respectively. The corresponding Breit-Coulomb contributions are given in columns headed B(2)
and B(2)
and hole E(2)
energies with the
latter being the dominant contribution. The values of E(2)
are non-zero only for diagonal matrix elements.
Although there are 142 diagonal and 1636 non-diagonal matrix elements for (3lj5l′
j′ ) (J) hole-particle states, we list
only the part of odd-parity subset with J=1 in Table II. It can be seen from the table that second-order Breit-Coulomb
corrections are relatively large and, therefore, must be included in accurate calculations. The values of non-diagonal
matrix elements given in columns headed E(2)
are comparable with values of diagonal two-body matrix
elements. However, the values of one-body contributions, E(2)
1 , are larger than the values of two-body

2 , respectively. As a result, total second-order diagonal matrix elements are much larger

In Table III, we present results for the zeroth-, ﬁrst-, and second-order Coulomb contributions, E(0), E(1), and E(2),
and the ﬁrst- and second-order Breit-Coulomb corrections, B(1)
hf and B(2). It should be noted that corrections for the
frequency-dependent Breit interaction [44] are included in the ﬁrst order only. The diﬀerence between the ﬁrst-order
Breit-Coulomb corrections calculated with and without frequency dependence is less than 1%. As one can see from
Table III, the ratio of non-diagonal and diagonal matrix elements is larger for the ﬁrst-order contributions than for the
second-order contributions. Another diﬀerence in the ﬁrst- and second-order contributions is the symmetry properties:
the ﬁrst-order non-diagonal matrix elements are symmetric and the second-order non-diagonal matrix elements are
not symmetric. The values of E(2)[a′v′(J), av(J)] and E(2)[av(J), a′v′(J)] matrix elements diﬀer in some cases by a
factor 2–3 and occasionally have opposite signs.

We now discuss how the ﬁnal energy levels are obtained from the above contributions. To determine the ﬁrst-order
energies of the states under consideration, we diagonalize the symmetric ﬁrst-order eﬀective Hamiltonian, including
both the Coulomb and Breit interactions. The ﬁrst-order expansion coeﬃcient CN [av(J)] (often a mixing coeﬃcient)is
the N -th eigenvector of the ﬁrst-order eﬀective Hamiltonian and E(1)[N ] is the corresponding eigenvalue. The resulting
eigenvectors are used to determine the second-order Coulomb correction E(2)[N ], the second-order Breit-Coulomb
correction B(2)[N ] and the QED correction ELamb[N ].

FIG. 4: The ﬁrst- and second-order Coulomb corrections (Z(1), Z(2)), and second-order Breit-Coulomb corrections (B(2)) for
E1, E2, and E3 uncoupled matrix elements for transitions between excited and ground states calculated in length (L)and
velocity (V ) forms in Ni-like ions.

In Table IV, we list the following contributions to the energies of 13 excited states in W46+: the sum of the
zeroth and ﬁrst-order energies E(0+1) = E(0) +E(1)+B(1)
hf , the second-order Coulomb energy E(2), the second-order
Breit-Coulomb correction B(2), the QED correction ELAMB, and the sum of the above contributions Etot. The QED
correction is approximated as the sum of the one-electron self energy and the ﬁrst-order vacuum-polarization energy.
The screened self-energy and vacuum polarization data given by Kim et al. [45], which are in close agreement with
screened self-energy calculations by Blundell

[46] are used to determine the QED correction ELAMB.

When starting calculations from relativistic DHF wavefunctions, it is natural to use jj designations for uncoupled
transition and energy matrix elements; however, neither jj nor LS coupling describes the physical states properly,
except for the single-conﬁguration state 3d5/25g9/2(7) ≡ 3d5g 3I7. Both designations are used in Table IV.

B. Z-dependence of eigenvectors and eigenvalues in Ni-like ions

In Figs. 1 - 2, we illustrate the Z-dependence of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the 3lj 5l′

j′ (J) hole-particle
states. We refer to a set of states of the same parity and the same J as a complex of states. Strong mixing for
the 3lj 4l′
j′ (J) hole-particle states was discussed in many papers (see, for example, [33, 39]). It should be noted

j′ (J) states are less mixed than the 3lj 4l′

j′ (J) states. For odd-parity complex with J=1, we found
strong mixing only for states with 3p-hole, 3pj5s1/2 (1) and 3pj 5dj′ (1) states. In Fig. 1, we show the dependence of
the eigenvectors using the example of odd-parity states with J=1. This particular J=1 odd-parity complex includes
13 states which are listed in Table I. Using the ﬁrst-order expansion coeﬃcients CN [av(J)] deﬁned in the previous
section, we can present the resulting eigenvectors as

Φ(N ) = CN [3d3/25p1/2(1)]Φ[3d3/25p1/2(1)] + CN [3d5/25p3/2(2)]Φ[3d5/25p3/2(1)] +

As a result, 169 CN [av(J)] coeﬃcients are needed to describe the 13 eigenvalues. For simplicity, we plot only three of
the 13 mixing coeﬃcients for the level N =3p5d 1,3P1 in Fig. 1. These coeﬃcients are chosen to illustrate the mixing
of the states; the remaining mixing coeﬃcients give very small contributions to this level. We observe strong mixing
between [3p1/25s1/2(1)] + [3p3/25d3/2(1)] + [3p3/25d5/2(1)] states for Z=57 - 58.

Energies, relative to the ground state, of odd- and even-parity states with J=1, 2 and 3, divided by (Z − 21)2,
are shown in Fig. 2.
It should be noted that Z was decreased by 21 to provide better presentation of the en-
ergy diagrams. We plot the limited number of energy levels to illustrate Z dependence choosing one representative
from a conﬁguration. As a result, we show 6 levels instead of 68 odd-parity states, and 6 levels instead of 74
for the even-parity states in Fig. 2. LS designations are chosen by small values of multiplet splitting for low-Z
ions. To conﬁrm those LS designations we obtain the ﬁne structure splitting for the 3d5s 3D, 3d5p[ 3P, 3D, 3F ],
3d5d[ 3P, 3D, 3F, 3G], 3d5f [ 3P, 3D, 3F, 3G, 3H], 3d5g[ 3D, 3F, 3G, 3H, 3I], 3p5s[ 3P ], 3p5p[ 3P, 3D],
3p5d[ 3P, 3D, 3F ], 3p5f [ 3D, 3F, 3G], 3p5g[ 3F, 3G, 3H], 3s5p 3P , 3s5f 3F , and 3s5g 3G triplets.

Energy diﬀerences between levels of odd- and even-parity triplet terms, divided by (Z − 21)2, are illustrated in
Fig. 3. The energy intervals for the 3d5p( 3P2 − 3P1), 3d5p( 3D3 − 3D2), 3d5p( 3F3 − 3F2), 3d5f ( 3P2 − 3P1),
3d5f ( 3G4 − 3G3), 3d5f ( 3G5 − 3G4), 3d5f ( 3H5 − 3H4), and 3p5s( 3P1 − 3P0) states are very small and almost do not
change with Z as can be seen from Fig. 3. It is the very sharp change of splitting with Z for the 3d5f 3F and 3p5f 3F
terms but the energies ∆E/(Z − 21)2 change by small values, from 5 cm−1 to -20 cm−1 and 20 cm−1 to -30 cm−1,
respectively. The energy intervals vary strongly with the nuclear charge for the 3d5p( 3P1 − 3P0), 3d5p( 3D2 − 3D1),
3d5p( 3F4 − 3F3), 3d5f ( 3P1 − 3P0), and 3d5f ( 3H6 − 354) states. Our calculations show that the ﬁne structures of
almost all levels illustrated in Figs. 3 do not follow the Land´e rules even for small Z. The unusual splittings may be
caused by changes from LS to jj coupling, with mixing from other triplet and singlet states. The diﬀerent J states
are mixed diﬀerently. Further experimental conﬁrmation would be very helpful in verifying the correctness of these
sometimes sensitive mixing parameters.

IV. ELECTRIC-DIPOLE, ELECTRIC-QUADRUPOLE, AND ELECTRIC-OCTUPOLE MATRIX
ELEMENTS

We calculate electric-dipole (E1) matrix elements for the transitions between the 13 odd-parity 3dj5pj′ (1),
3dj5fj′(1), 3pj5s1/2(1), 3pj5dj′ (1), and 3s1/25pj′(1) excited states and the ground state, electric-quadrupole (E2) ma-
trix elements between the 17 even-parity 3dj5s1/2(2), 3dj5dj′ (2), 3dj5gj′ (2), 3pj5pj′(2), 3pj5fj′ (2), and 3s1/25dj′ (2)
excited states and the ground state, and electric-quadrupole (E2) matrix elements between the 15 odd-parity
3dj5pj′(3), 3dj5fj′ (3), 3pj5s1/2(3), 3pj5dj′ (3), 3pj5gj′ (3), and 3s1/25fj′ (2) excited states and the ground state for
Ni-like ions with nuclear charges Z = 30 − 100. Analytical expressions for multipole matrix elements in the ﬁrst and
the second order RMBPT are given by Eqs. (2.12)-(2.17) of Ref. [39].

The ﬁrst- and second-order Coulomb corrections and second-order Breit-Coulomb corrections to reduced E1 and E2
matrix elements will be referred to as Z (1), Z (2), and B(2), respectively, throughout the text. These contributions are
calculated in both length and velocity gauges. In this section, we show the importance of the diﬀerent contributions
and discuss the gauge dependence of the E1, E2, and E3 matrix elements.

A. Example: E1, E2, and E3 matrix elements for W46+

In Table V, we list values of uncoupled ﬁrst- and second-order E1, E2, and E3 matrix elements Z (1), Z (2), B(2),
together with derivative terms P (derv), for Ni-like tungsten, Z=74. We list values for the E1 transitions between
odd-parity states with J=1, the ground state and the E2 transitions between even-parity states with J=2 and the
ground state, the E3 transitions between odd-parity states with J=3, respectively. Matrix elements in both length
(L) and velocity (V ) forms are given. We can see that the ﬁrst-order matrix elements, Z (1)
V , diﬀer by 5–10%;
however, the L–V diﬀerences between second-order matrix elements are much larger for some transitions. Also for the
E1 transitions, the derivative term in length form, P (derv)
L but the derivative term in velocity
form, P (derv)
V by three to four orders of magnitude. For the E2 transitions, the value of P (derv)
in velocity form almost equals Z (1) in velocity form and the P (derv) in length form is larger by factor of two than Z (1)
in length form. For the E3 transitions, the value of P (derv) in velocity form is larger by factor of two than Z (1) in
velocity form and the P (derv) in length form is larger by factor of three than Z (1) in length form.

V

Values of E1, E2, and E3 coupled reduced matrix elements in length and velocity forms are illustrated in Table VI
for the limited set of transitions. Although we use an intermediate-coupling scheme, it is nevertheless convenient to
label the physical states using the jj labelling for high-Z and the LS labelling for low-Z; both designations are used
in Table VI. The ﬁrst two columns in Table VI show L and V values of coupled reduced matrix elements calculated in
ﬁrst order. The L − V diﬀerence is about 5–10%. Including the second-order contributions (columns headed RMBPT
in Table VI) decreases the L − V diﬀerence to 0.02–2%. This non-zeroth L − V diﬀerence arises because we start
our RMBPT calculations using a non-local Dirac-Fock (DF) potential. If we were to replace the DF potential by a
local potential, the diﬀerences would disappear completely. It should be emphasized that we include the negative
energy state (NES) contributions to sums over intermediate states (see Ref. [41] for details). Neglecting the NES
contributions leads to small changes in the L-form matrix elements but to substantial changes in some of the V -form
matrix elements with a consequent loss of gauge independence.

B. Z-dependences of E1 and E2 matrix elements in Ni-like ions

In Fig. 4, diﬀerences between length and velocity forms are illustrated for the various contributions to uncoupled
0 − 3d5/25f7/2(1), 0 − 3d3/25g7/2(2), and 0 − 3d3/25f5/2(3) matrix elements, where 0 is the ground state. In the case of
E1 transitions, the ﬁrst-order matrix element Z (1) is proportional to 1/Z, the second-order Coulomb matrix element
Z (2) is proportional to 1/Z 2, and the second-order Breit-Coulomb matrix element B(2) is almost independent of Z
(see [41]) for high Z. Therefore, we plot Z (1) × (Z − 21), Z (2) × (Z − 21)2, and B(2) × 104 for the 0 − 3d5/25f7/2(1)
transition. All these contributions are positive, except for the second-order Coulomb matrix elements Z (2) in lengths
form.

The diﬀerence between length- and velocity-forms for E2 transitions is illustrated in Fig. 4 for the uncoupled
0 − 3d3/25g7/2(2) matrix element. In the case of E2 transitions, the ﬁrst-order matrix element Z (1) is proportional to
1/Z 2, the second-order Coulomb matrix element Z (2) is proportional to 1/Z 3, and the second-order Breit-Coulomb
matrix element B(2) is proportional to 1/Z for high Z. We plot Z (1) × (Z − 21), Z (2) × (Z − 21)2, B(2) × 104 for the
better illustration of those contributions in the right panel of Fig. 4. All these contributions are positive.

11

The diﬀerence between length- and velocity-forms for E3 transitions is illustrated in Fig. 4 for the uncoupled
0 − 3d3/25f5/2(3) matrix element. We plot Z (1) × (Z − 21)2, Z (2) × (Z − 21)3, and B(2) × (Z − 21) × 104 in the bottom
panel of Fig. 4. The second-order Breit-Coulomb correction to the E3 matrix element B(2) is much smaller in velocity
form than in length form, as seen in the ﬁgure.

The diﬀerences between results in length- and velocity-forms shown in Fig. 4 are compensated by additional second-
order terms called “derivative terms” P (derv); they are deﬁned by Eq. (2.16) of Ref. [39] (see, also Tables V and VI).
The derivative terms arise because transition amplitudes depend on the energy, and the transition energy changes
order-by-order in RMBPT calculations.

V. MAGNETIC-DIPOLE, MAGNETIC-QUADRUPOLE, AND MAGNETIC-OCTUPOLE MATRIX
ELEMENTS

We calculate magnetic-dipole (M1) matrix elements for the transitions between the 13 even-parity 3dj5s1/2(1),
3dj5dj′ (1), 3dj5dj′ (1), 3pj5pj′ (1), 3pj5fj′ (1), 3s1/25s1/2(1), and 3s1/25dj′ (1) excited states and the ground state,
magnetic-quadrupole (M2) matrix elements between the 16 odd-parity 3dj5pj′ (2), 3dj5fj′ (2), 3pj5s1/2(2), 3pj5dj′ (2),
3pj5gj′ (2), 3s1/25pj′(2), and 3s1/25fj′(2) excited states and the ground state, and magnetic-octupole (M3) matrix
elements for the transitions between the 16 even-parity 3dj5s1/2(3), 3dj5dj′ (3), 3dj5dj′ (3), 3dj5gj′(3), 3pj5pj′ (3),
3pj5fj′ (3), 3s1/25s1/2(3), and 3s1/25dj′ (3) excited states and the ground state for Ni-like ions with nuclear charges
Z = 30 − 100.

We calculate ﬁrst- and second-order Coulomb, second-order Breit-Coulomb corrections, and second-order derivative
term to reduced M1 and M2 matrix elements Z (1), Z (2), B(2), and P (derv), respectively, using the method described in
Eqs. (2.13) - (2.18) of Ref.[39] and Eqs. (A3–A5) of Ref. [47], respectively. In this section, we illustrate the importance
of the relativistic and frequency-dependent contributions to the ﬁrst-order M1 and M2 matrix elements. We also show
the importance of the taking into account the second-order RMBPT contributions to M1 and M2 matrix elements and
we subsequently discuss the necessity of including the negative-energy contributions to sums over intermediate states.
Ab initio relativistic calculations require careful treatment of negative-energy states (virtual electron-positron pairs).
In second-order matrix elements, such contributions explicitly arise from those terms in the sum over states for which
εi < −mc2. The eﬀect of the NES contributions to M1-amplitudes has been studied recently in Ref. [48]. The NES
contributions drastically change the second-order Breit-Coulomb matrix elements B(2). However, the second-order
Breit-Coulomb correction contributes only 2–5% to uncoupled M1 matrix elements and, as a result, negative-energy
states change the total values of M1 matrix elements by a few percent only.

A. Z-dependences of M1, M2, and M3 matrix elements in Ni-like ions

BR, in the same ﬁgure. As we observe from the left panel of Fig. 5, the values of Z (1)

The diﬀerences between ﬁrst-order M1 uncoupled matrix elements, calculated in nonrelativistic, relativistic
frequency-independent, and relativistic frequency-dependent approximations are illustrated in the left panel of Fig. 5
for the 0 − 3d5/25d5/2(1) matrix element. The corresponding matrix elements are labeled Z (1)
NR. For-
mulas for relativistic frequency-dependent and non-relativistic ﬁrst-order M1 matrix elements are given by Eqs. (3–6)
of Ref. [48]. We also plot the second-order Coulomb contributions, Z (2)
CL, and the second-order Breit-Coulomb contri-
butions, Z (2)
NR are twice as small as
the values of Z (1)
RF. Therefore, relativistic eﬀects are very large for M1 transitions. The frequency-dependent
relativistic matrix elements Z (1)
R by 10–40%.
The diﬀerences between other ﬁrst-order matrix elements calculated with and without frequency dependence are also
the order of a few percent. Uncoupled second-order M1 matrix elements Z (2)
CL are comparable to ﬁrst-order matrix
elements Z (1)
RF for small Z but the relative size of the second-order contribution decreases for high Z. This is expected
since second-order Coulomb matrix elements Z (2)
CL are proportional to Z for high Z while ﬁrst-order matrix elements
Z (1)
RF grow as Z 2. The second-order Breit-Coulomb matrix elements Z (2)
BR are proportional to Z 3 and become larger
than Z (2)

The diﬀerences between ﬁrst-order M2 uncoupled matrix elements, calculated in relativistic frequency-dependent,

right panel of Fig. 5. The corresponding matrix elements are labeled Z (1)

dependent and frequency-independent ﬁrst-order M2 matrix elements are given by Eqs. (A3–A5) of Ref. [47]. We also

The diﬀerences between ﬁrst-order M3 uncoupled matrix elements, calculated in relativistic frequency-dependent,
and relativistic frequency-independent approximations are illustrated for the 0 − 3d5/25s1/2(3) matrix element in the
bottom panel of Fig. 5. The corresponding matrix elements are labeled Z (1)
R . We also plot the second-order
Coulomb contributions, Z (2)

In Fig. 6, we illustrate the Z-dependence of the line strengths of M1 transition from the 3d5s 3D1 excited state to
the ground state. In this ﬁgure, we plot the values of the ﬁrst-order line strengths S(1)
RF calculated in
the same approximations as the M1 uncoupled matrix elements: nonrelativistic, relativistic frequency-independent,
and relativistic frequency-dependent approximations, respectively. The total line strengths S(1+2), which include
second-order corrections, are also plotted.
It should be noted that the value of nonrelativistic matrix element,
Z (1)
NR(0 − 3d5/25s1/2(1)) equal to zero. Small mixing inside of the even-parity complex with J=1 between 3d5/25s1/2,
3d5/25d3/2 3d5/25d5/2, and 3p1/25p1/2 states gives non-zero value even for Z = 30 of the ﬁrst-order line strengths
NR. Non-zero value of Z (1)
S(1)
R (0 − 3d5/25s1/2(1)) increases the ﬁrst-order line strengths by three order of magnitude for
Z = 30. The diﬀerence between the values of S(1)
RF is 26 % for Z = 30. The second-order contribution gives
additional contribution for the value of the line strengths, the ratio of S(1+2)
RF is about 5 for Z = 30. The
ratios between S(1)
are changed with Z as can be seen from Fig. 6 by increasing relativistic
eﬀects.

In Table VII, we present our RMBPT calculations for E1, E2, E3, M1, M2, and M3 transition rates and wavelengths
in the case of Ni-like tungsten, Z=74.

VI. COMPARISON OF RESULTS WITH OTHER THEORY AND EXPERIMENT

We calculate energies of the 74 even-parity 3dj5s1/2(J), 3dj5dj′ (J), 3dj5gj′ (J), 3pj5pj′ (J), 3pj5fj′ (J),

3s1/25s1/2′(J), 3s1/25dj′ (J), and 3s1/25gj′(J) excited states and 68 odd-parity 3dj5pj′(J), 3dj5fj′ (J),
3pj5s1/2(J), 3pj5dj′ (J), 3pj5gj′ (J), 3s1/25pj′(J), and 3s1/25fj′(J) excited states for Ni-like ions with nuclear charges
Z=30-100. Reduced matrix elements, oscillator strengths, and transition rates are determined for E1, E2, E3, M1, M2,
and M3 allowed and forbidden transitions into the ground state for each ions. Comparisons are also given with other
theoretical results and with experimental data. Our results are presented in two parts: wavelengths and transition
probabilities.

A. Transition energies

In Table VIII, we compare our RMBPT results for the excitation energies of the odd-parity states in Ni-like tungsten
with theoretical results obtained by diﬀerent codes: DFS code by Zhang et al.
[25], and COWAN code [49]. The
diﬀerence in results is about 0.1–0.2 %. It should be noted that the RMBPT and DFS codes used jj-coupling, however,
the COWAN code used LS-coupling for uncoupled matrix elements. To compare results obtained after diagonalization
of energy matrixes in Table VIII, we use LS designations. We found that resulting LS designations in three codes
diﬀer for some states. Those two labelling are diﬀerent for some levels. In the COWAN code, a label for every level
was chosen by maximum value among eigenvectors. It is not convenient sometimes when two levels have the same

13

label. In the present paper, we use RMBPT code to evaluate energies for whole isoelectronic sequence. It is known
that the crossing energy levels inside the one complex with ﬁxed J is forbidden by Wigner and Neumann theorem
(see, for example, in Ref. [50]). As a result, we can use only numbering of the levels by the ordering of energies. We
already mentioned, either LS or jj designations are used to label the resulting eigenvectors and eigenvalues rather
than simply enumerating with an index N . We choose the LS designations here since the jj designations are used
for uncouple matrix elements. The LSJ labels are chosen by small values of multiplet splitting for low-Z ions.

B. E1, E2, E3, M1, M2, and M3 transition probabilities

We present the resulting transition probabilities (Ar) in Figs. 7 and 8. Transition rates for the six E1 lines from
3d5p 3P1, 3D1, 1P1 and 3p5d 3P1, 1P1, 3D1 levels to the ground state are plotted in the top panel of Fig. 7. The
sharp features in the curves shown in these ﬁgures can be explained in many cases by strong mixing of states inside the
odd-parity complex with J=1. The double cusp in the interval Z=57-59 and deep minimum in the Z=51-53 range for
the curve with the 3p5d 3P1 label can be explained by mixing of the 3p3/25d3/2 (1), 3p3/25d5/2 (1), and 3p1/25s1/2 (1)
states. The deep minimum in the Z=86-87 range for the curve with the 3d5dp 1P label can be explained by decreasing
of the second-order contribution to the 0 − 3d3/25p3/2 (1) dipole matrix element. This matrix element gives the main
part of contribution to the transition rate for the 3d5p 1P1 state.

Transition rates for the ﬁve E2 lines from 3d5s 3D2, 1D2 and 3d5g 3D2, 3F2, 1D2 levels to the ground state are
plotted in the central panel of Fig. 7. The curves describing 3d5s 3D2, 1D2 transition rates smoothly increase with
Z without any sharp features. The diﬀerence in values of Ar for 3d5s 3D2 and 3d5s 1D2 lines is about 20–50%. It is
so small diﬀerence in the values of of Ar for 3d5g 3D2 and 3d5g 3F2 up to Z = 60. The double cusp in the interval
Z=88-89 range and deep minimum in the Z= 84 for the curve with the 3d5g 1D2 label can be explained by mixing
of the 3d5/25g7/2 (2) and 3d5/25g9/2 (2) states.

Transition rates for the seven E3 lines from 3d5p 3F3, 1F3, 3D3 and 3d5f 3D3, 3G3, 3F3, 1F3 levels to the ground
state are plotted in the bottom panel of Fig. 7. The deep minimum in the Z= 50 for the curve with the 3d5f 3G3
label can be explained by mixing of the 3d5/25f5/2 (3) and 3d5/25f7/2 (3) states, however the deep minimum in the
Z= 54 for the curve with the 3d5f 1F3 label can be explained by mixing of the 3d3/25f5/2 (3) and 3d3/25f7/2 (3)
states.

Transition rates for the seven M1 lines from 3d5d 3S1, 3P1, 3D1, 1P1, 3d5g 3D1, 3d5s 3D1, and 3s5s 3S1 levels to
the ground state are plotted in the top panel of Fig. 8. The deep minima in the Z= 41 for the curve with the 3d5d 1P1
label can be explained by strong mixing between 3d5/25d3/2 and 3d5/25d5/2 states. The value of Ar for 3s5s 3S1 line
is smaller than the value of Ar for 3d5s 3D1 line by factor 102 - 104.

Transition rates for the eight M2 lines from 3d5p 3F2, 3P2, 3D2, 1D2 and 3d5f 3P2, 3D2, 1D2, 3F2 levels to
the ground state are plotted in central panel of Fig. 8. We can see from these ﬁgures that the curves describing
M2 transition rates, except curves with 3d5p 1D2 and 3d5f 1D2 labels, smoothly increase with Z without any sharp
features. It should be noted that the main part of contribution to the transition rate of the 3d5p 1D2 state gives
0 − 3d3/25p3/2 (2) dipole matrix element. This matrix element has zero value in the ﬁrst-order approximation. The
small non-zero value for the transition rate of the 3d5p 1D2 state is due to the correlation second-order contribution
and mixing inside of the 3dj5pj′ (2) complex.

Transition rates for the nine M3 lines from 3d5s 3D3, 3d5d 3G3, 3D3, 3F3, 1F3 and 3d5g 3D3, 3F3, 1F3, 3G3 levels
to the ground state are plotted in bottom panel of Fig. 8. The sharp features in the curves shown in these ﬁgures can
be explained in many cases by strong mixing of states inside of the odd-parity 3dj5dj′ (3) and 3dj5gj′ (3) complexes.
In Table IX, wavelengths (λ in ˚A) and oscillator strengths f for odd-parity states with J=1 are illustrated for
Ni-like ions. We limit the table to those transitions given in Ref. [25]. Comparison of f obtained by RMBPT and
DFS codes are given. We use LSJ labelling for data with RMBPT headings and the M17 – M22 from Table I and
Table III of Ref. [25] for data with DFS headings. As can be seen from Table IX, the diﬀerence between both results is
about 5 - 20%. This diﬀerence can be explained by the second order contribution included in our RMBPT calculations
since results in Refs. [25] were obtained in MCDF approximations. To support this conclusion, we include values for
oscillator strengths calculated in the ﬁrst-order approximation in Table IX (column ”RMBPT1”). We can see from
this table that DFS data better agree with results of the ﬁrst-order approximation (RMBPT1) than with RMBPT
results.

In Table X, wavelengths (λ in ˚A) and transition rates (A in s−1) for odd-parity states with J=1 are listed for
Ni-like xenon. We compare our results with theoretical results obtained by Skobelev et al. in Ref. [26]. We already
mentioned that results obtained by three methods (HFR, MCDF, and HULLAC) were compared in [26]. Our results
better agree with results obtained by the HULLAC code, as is seen from Table X. It should be noted that HULLAC
results are between our RMBPT results and results of the ﬁrst-order approximation (RMBPT1) (see columns with

14

headings ’RMBPT’ and ’RMBPT1’ in Table X).

Transition energies and transition rates for the 3d5/2 − 5f7/2 and 3d3/2 − 5f5/2 transitions in Ni-like ions with
Z = 56–92 are given in Table XI. We limit the table to those ions with available experimental measurements. We
compare our RMBPT calculations with experimental measurements presented in Refs.[13, 15, 18, 19, 20]. It should
be noted that our RMBPT data are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements presented by Elliot et
al. in Ref. [13].

VII. CONCLUSION

We have presented a systematic second-order relativistic RMBPT study of excitation energies, reduced matrix ele-
ments, line strengths, and transition rates for ∆n=1 electric- and magnetic-dipole, electric- and magnetic-quadrupole,
and electric- and magnetic-octupole transitions in Ni-like ions with nuclear charges Z=30–100. Our calculations of
the retarded E1, E2, E3, M1, M2, and M3 matrix elements include correlation corrections from both Coulomb and
Breit interactions. Contributions from virtual electron-positron pairs were also included in the second-order matrix
elements. Both length and velocity forms of the E1, E2, and E2 matrix elements were evaluated and small diﬀerences,
caused by the non-locality of the starting DF potential, were found between the two forms. Second-order RMBPT
transition energies were used to evaluate oscillator strengths and transition rates. Good agreement of our RMBPT
data with other accurate theoretical results leads us to conclude that the RMBPT method provides accurate data for
Ni-like ions. Results from the present calculations provide benchmark values for future theoretical and experimental
studies of the nickel isoelectronic sequence.

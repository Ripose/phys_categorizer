We have used the hyperspherical adiabatic representation to describe the system of three identical
bosons in an spin stretched state interacting by an attractive 1/r potential. A proposal has been
made how such a system might be realized experimentally in cold trapped atoms using extremely
oﬀ-resonant laser ﬁelds [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 5687 (2000)]. We have obtained eﬀective potentials,
channel functions, and nonadiabatic couplings for this gravity-like interaction, allowing us to calcu-
late the ground state energy with accuracy that substantially improves upon previous results. We
have similarly calculated the energies for the ﬁrst four 0+ excited states. These results show that
the simple adiabatic hyperspherical approximation oﬀers an accurate description for such a system.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, a scheme for inducing gravitation-like in-
teratomic potentials has been proposed [1], opening up
the possibility to create self-bound Bose-Einstein con-
densates (BECs) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
In such a scheme,
the gravitation-like interatomic potential can be achieved
by irradiating the atoms with intense, extremely oﬀ-

anisotropy due to dipole-dipole interactions can, in fact,
be averaged out [7] by the proper combination of laser
beams, leaving a
u/r potential, where u is the strength
of the potential (the analogue of GM m, where G is the
Newton’s constant and M and m are the masses) and r
is the interparticle distance. The strength u of the po-
tential can be adjusted by changing the laser intensity
[1].

−

In ultracold atomic gases, two interesting regimes for
self-bound BECs have been predicted, assuming that
the short-range interatomic interactions can be indepen-
dently tuned by, say, applying a magnetic ﬁeld near a
Feshbach resonance [8]. In one regime, the attractive 1/r
interactions are balanced by the repulsive mean ﬁeld in-
teration assuming a positive two-body scattering length
and negligible kinetic energy. In the other regime, the
balancing factor is kinetic energy, assuming negligible
mean ﬁeld interactions.
In both regimes, the resulting
BEC is self-bound. From a broader point of view, the
induced gravitation-like interaction might make possi-
ble experimental emulation of boson stars (a system of
self-gravitating bosons) in the regime where the kinetic
energy balances the
u/r potential [9, 10]. Moreover,
purely attractive 1/r potentials constitute an interesting
contrast to the attractive and repulsive Coulomb poten-
tials atomic physics are used to.

−

The existence of a lower bound for the ground state
energy in many-body systems interacting through attrac-
tive 1/r potentials is of fundamental importance in or-
der to prove the existence of the thermodynamical limit
and the stability of normal matter [11].
It was shown
in Ref. [12] that for a system of N identical, spinless (or
spin stretched) bosons of mass m interacting gravitation-

In this paper, we have used the adiabatic hyperspheri-
cal representation for this systm to obtain eﬀective three-
body potentials, the corresponding channel functions,
and the nonadiabatic couplings. Using these, we calcu-
late the ground state and low-lying 0+ excited state en-
ergies converged to seven digits. We have also used the
adiabatic hyperspherical representation to obtain lower
and upper bounds that diﬀer by about 0.1%, indicating
that a simple single-channel description oﬀers a quite ac-
curate description of such systems.

II. THE ADIABATIC HYPERSPHERICAL
REPRESENTATION

We have solved the Schr¨odinger equation in hyper-
spherical coordinates. After separation of the center-of-
mass motion, the system is described by the hyperradius
R which gives the overall size; three Euler angles α, β
and γ, specifying the orientation of the plane containing
the three particles relative to the space-ﬁxed frame; and
other two hyperangles ϕ and θ, describing the internal
relative motion between the particles. We have deﬁned
ϕ and θ as a modiﬁcation of Smith-Whitten coordinates
[13, 14, 15]. The key to the adiabatic hyperspherical rep-
resentation is that the dynamics of the three-body system
is reduced to collective motion under the inﬂuence of one-
dimensional eﬀective potentials in R, which is governed
by a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations.

The hyperspherical coordinates are introduced through
the mass-scaled Jacobi coordinates ~ρ1 and ~ρ2 (see Fig. 1)

In the adiabatic hyperspherical representation, the to-
tal wave function is expanded in terms of the channel
functions Φν(R; Ω),

ψn(R, Ω) =

Fnν(R)Φν (R; Ω),

(5)

Xν

where Fnν (R) are the hyperradial wavefunctions, n labels
the diﬀerent energy eigenstates for a given ν, and ν repre-
sents all remaining quantum numbers necessary to spec-
ify each channel. The channel functions Φν(R; Ω) form a
complete set of orthonormal functions at each value of R
and are eigenfunctions of the adiabatic Hamiltonian:

Had(R, Ω)Φν (R; Ω) = Uν(R)Φν(R; Ω).

(6)

The eigenvalues Uν(R) help deﬁne eﬀective three-body
potentials for the hyperradial motion.

Substituting Eq. (5) into the Schr¨odinger equation
(3) and projecting out Φν′, we obtain the hyperradial
Schr¨odinger equation

In this paper, we explore the solutions of the system of
diﬀerential equations (7) for three particles with attrac-
tive 1/r interactions. We determine the eﬀective poten-
tials and couplings by solving Eq. (6) for the J π = 0+
symmetry, where J is the total orbital angular momen-
tum and π is the total parity. The low-lying bound state
energies are then determined by solving Eq. (7).

In order to solve the adiabatic equation (6), we have
expanded the channel functions Φν(R; Ω) in terms of the

jecting out the D functions, the resulting coupled system
of partial diﬀerential equations for φKν (R; θ, ϕ) is solved
(for each value of R) by expanding φKν(R; θ, ϕ) on a
direct product of ﬁfth order basis splines [18] in the hy-
perangles θ and ϕ [14, 15]. For J π = 0+, of course, the
sum involves only one term, requiring the solution of a
single two-dimensional partial diﬀerential equation.

Figure 2 shows the potential V (R, θ, ϕ) as a function
of θ and ϕ at R = 100. The singular points at θ = π/2
and ϕ = π/3, π and 5π/3 are the points where r23 = 0,
r31 = 0 and r12 = 0, respectively. Notice that our choice
for the hyperangles θ and ϕ [14, 15] — like any of the so-
caller democratic or Smith-Whitten coordinates — im-
plies a periodicity of the potential in ϕ for identical par-
ticles, which substantially simpliﬁes the numerical solu-
tion of Eq. (6) when symmetrizing the wave function.
The two-dimensional equation for J π = 0+ thus needs
to be solved only from ϕ = 0 to 2π/3, with the require-
ment that the derivative of φ(R; θ, ϕ) with respect to ϕ
is zero at each boundary, followed by postsymmetriza-
tion to extract the completely symmetric solutions. We
have treated the cusp due the 1/r divergence as r
0
by including more spline functions [18] at ϕ = π/3. For
other J π the solutions can be determined in a similar way
[14, 15].

where I is the laser intensity, q the photon wave number,

teraction is controllable via the laser’s parameters. For
the present calculations, however, we base our units on u,
thus producing a unitless equation. Our length units are
2~2/mu, and our energy units are mu2/2~2. These yield,
in analogy to atomic units, a two-body energy spectrum

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 3 shows the eﬀective three-body potentials in
2Uν(R)]−1/2 such that for large values of R
the form [
they converge to the principal quantum number n2b asso-
ciated with the two-body hydrogen-like subsystems (for
R
one particle is far from the others). The low-
est potential in Fig. 3, converging to n2b = 1, supports
the 0+ bound states (or Se, in analogy with atomic spec-
troscopic notation). In particular, it contains both the
ground state and the Se series of singly excited states,
using the language of atomic structure. The higher po-
tentials (converging to n2b > 1) support series of dou-
bly excited states that are coupled to and can decay
to the continuum of the lowest potential and are thus
metastable. These comments draw on the similarity of
these potentials to those for three-body systems like He
and H− [19]. There are minor diﬀerences, of course, due
to the diﬀerent permutational symmetries of the two sys-
tems and to the absence of the Coulomb repulsion for the
present case.

Since the J π = 0+ channel functions depend only on
the hyperangles θ and ϕ they can be plotted in their
entirety for each value of R. Figures 4 and 5 show the
channel functions for the two lowest channels at R = 0.69
and 100 for ν = 1, and R = 5.75 and 100 for ν = 2. The
ﬁrst R value lies near the respective potential minima;
and the second, in the asymptotic region. For small R,

they lie along a line. Figure 4(a) shows that near the
ν = 1 potential minimum (see Fig. 3) the lowest channel
function is spread out over the entire hyperangular plane
with an increased amplitude near the two-body coales-
cence point (r31 = 0) at θ = π/2 and ϕ = π/3. This
point corresponds to a linear conﬁguration with two of
the particles closer to each other than to the third par-
ticle, representing strong two-body correlations. Since
this R is the equilibrium distance, the three particles in
the ground state thus assume all triangular shapes be-
tween linear and equilateral with a preference for linear
shapes having two particles close to each other (taking
into account the sin2θ volume element). As R increases
[Fig. 4(b)] the channel function “collapses” to the region
around the coalescence points, displaying the two-body
character it must have for R
— in this case the
1s state. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the ν = 2 channel
function. They show much the same behavior as ν = 1
except with the necessary addition of a node. Figure
5(b) shows that ν = 2 converges to the 2s state of the
two-body subsystem. Note that for identical spinless (or
spin-stretched) bosons, 2p two-body states are not al-
lowed by symmetry, so there is only a single potential
correlating to n2b = 2 at R

In Figure 6 we show the nonadiabatic couplings
Pνν′ (R) between the lowest channel and the next three
channels (Pνν = 0 and Pνν′ =
Pν′ν) calculated from
Eq. (9). The fact that the coupling P12 in Fig. 6 is sub-
stantially larger than the couplings with higher channels
implies rapid convergence for the bound state energies as
a function of the number of channels. Further, P12 peaks
around R = 6 which correlates roughly with the loca-
tion of an avoided crossing between the corresponding
potential curves as expected (see Fig.3).

ally be created experimentally by irradiating ultracold
atoms with intense, extremely oﬀ-resonant lasers. We
calculated the ground state and excited state energies
converged to seven digits which represents a substantial
improvement over previous results. Our method is essen-
tially exact, with the only approximation being the trun-
cation of the number of channels used in the expansion of
the total wave function. Although other methods, such
as Hylleraas variational techniques, might provide much
better bound states energies, as we have shown here, the
adiabatic hyperspherical representation naturally oﬀers
qualitative information along with quantitative results.

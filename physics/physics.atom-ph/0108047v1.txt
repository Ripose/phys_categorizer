Relativistic many-body calculations of van der Waals coeﬃcients C6 for dimers correlating to
two ground state alkaline-earth atoms at large internuclear separations are reported. The following
values and uncertainties were determined : C6 = 214(3) for Be, 627(12) for Mg, 2221(15) for Ca,
3170(196) for Sr, and 5160(74) for Ba in atomic units.

Introduction. The realization of Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) in dilute ultracold samples of hy-
drogen and alkali-metal atoms Li, Na, and Rb [1]
has prompted a search for other atomic and molecu-
lar species where BEC can possibly be attained. Of
non-alkali atoms, so far the condensation was successful
only with metastable helium [2, 3]. Cooling and trap-
ping experiments with alkaline-earth atoms (in partic-
ular Mg, Ca, and Sr) were recently reported (see, e.g.,
Ref. [4, 5, 6]) and prospects of achieving the condensation
with alkaline-earth atoms were also discussed [4, 7]. Ul-
tracold alkaline–earth atoms possess several advantages
over alkali-metal atoms. For example, utilization of the
narrow spin-forbidden transition 1S0 → 3P o
1 permits to
optically cool atoms down to nano–Kelvin regime [5, 8].
There is also a number of isotopes available with zero nu-
clear spin, so that the resulting molecular potentials are
not complicated by the “spaghetti” of hyperﬁne-structure
states; this simpliﬁes studies of trap losses and ultracold
collisions [9].

Here we apply relativistic many-body methods to the
determination of dispersion (van der Waals) coeﬃcients
C6 for the interaction of two identical alkaline-earth
atoms in their respective ground states. The leading in-
teraction of two ground-state atoms at large internuclear
separations R is parameterized as −C6/R6. Knowledge
of the dispersion coeﬃcients is required, for example, in
determination of scattering lengths governing properties
of Bose-Einstein condensates of dilute samples [10].

We employ several atomic relativistic many-body
methods of varying accuracy. The dominant contribu-
tion to C6 was evaluated with the conﬁguration interac-
tion (CI) method coupled with many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT) [11, 12]; smaller terms were computed
using the less accurate relativistic random-phase approx-
imation (RRPA) and Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) meth-
ods. The values were further adjusted with accurate the-
oretical and experimental data for electric-dipole matrix
elements and energies of principal transitions. We tabu-

late the values of C6 for Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. We also
estimate uncertainties to be on the order of 1-2% for all
alkaline-earth atoms, except for a 5% accuracy for Sr.

b. Method of calculations. The dispersion coeﬃcient
C6 describes a second-order correction to energies of
molecular terms related to the interaction of atomic
dipoles induced by molecular ﬁelds. Due to large inter-
nuclear separations involved, the two-center molecular-
structure problem is reduced to the determination of
atomic properties. The van der Waals coeﬃcient may
be expressed as [13]

C6 = 6

Xij

|hΨg|Dz|Ψii|2|hΨg|Dz|Ψji|2
(Ei − Eg) + (Ej − Eg)

,

(1)

where Ψg and Eg are the wavefunction and energy of the
atomic ground state, Dz is an electric-dipole operator,
and the summation is over intermediate atomic states
Ψi and Ψj with respective energies Ei and Ej. Atomic
units ¯h = |e| = me = 1 are used throughout. The above
relation can be recast into the Casimir-Polder form

C6 =

where α(iω) is the dynamic polarizability of imaginary
argument deﬁned as

α(iω) = 2Re

Xi

hΨg|Dz|ΨiihΨi|Dz|Ψgi
(Ei − Eg) + iω

.

(3)

The intermediate states in the sum, Eq. (3), can be
separated into valence and core-excited states. We write

α(iω) = αv(iω) + αc(iω) + αcv(iω) .

(4)

To determine the valence contribution αv we employ
combined relativistic conﬁguration interaction method
and many-body perturbation theory (CI+MBPT).
Smaller contributions of core-excited states αc are esti-
mated with the relativistic random-phase approximation
for the atomic core. In this method excitations of core
electrons are allowed into the occupied valence shell and
we introduce the correction αcv to account for a sub-
sequent violation of the Pauli exclusion principle; this

small correction is evaluated using the Dirac-Hartree-
Fock method.

Similar relativistic many-body techniques were in-
volved in our previous high-precision determination of
van der Waals coeﬃcients for atoms with one valence
electron outside a closed core [14, 15]. Divalent atoms,
considered here, present an additional challenge due to
a strong Coulomb repulsion of the valence electrons.
This strong interaction is treated here with the conﬁg-
uration interaction method and smaller residual correc-
tions (like core polarization) are treated with the many-
body perturbation theory. The method, designated as
CI+MBPT, was developed in Ref. [11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19].
Here we brieﬂy recap the main features of the
CI+MBPT method. The complete functional space for
electronic wavefunctions is partitioned in two parts: the
model space spanning all possible excitations of the two
valence electrons and an orthogonal space which adds
various excitations of core electrons. The valence CI ba-
sis set is saturated; e.g., the Ba ground state wavefunc-
tion is represented as a combination of 1450 relativistic
conﬁgurations in our calculations. Application of pertur-
bation theory leads to eﬀective operators encapsulating
many-body eﬀects and acting in the model space. For
example, the CI valence wavefunctions are determined
from the Schr¨odinger equation

Heﬀ (En) |Ψni = En |Ψni ,

with the eﬀective Hamiltonian deﬁned as

Heﬀ (E) = H0 + C + Σ(E).

(5)

(6)

Here H0 is the lowest-order Dirac-Fock Hamiltonian, C
is the residual Coulomb interaction between valence elec-
trons, and Σ is the energy-dependent self-energy opera-
tor corresponding to core-polarization eﬀects in model-
potential approaches. The operator Σ completely ac-
counts for the second order of perturbation theory. By
the same virtue, one introduces an eﬀective (dressed)
electric-dipole operator Deﬀ acting in the model space.
We determine this eﬀective operator using the random-
phase approximation (RPA) [20, 21]. Qualitatively, the
RPA describes a shielding of the externally applied ﬁeld
by the core electrons.

The dynamic valence polarizability αv(iω) was com-
puted with the Sternheimer [22] or Dalgarno-Lewis [23]
method implemented in the CI+MBPT+RPA frame-
work. At the heart of the method is a solution of an
inhomogeneous Schr¨odinger equation for a “perturbed”
state |δΨωi

(Heﬀ − Eg + iω)|δΨωi = (Dz)eﬀ |Ψgi ,

(7)

so that

αv(iω) = 2RehΨg|(Dz)eﬀ |δΨωi .

(8)

In these expressions the electric-dipole operator Deﬀ is
calculated at the CI+MBPT+RPA level of approxima-
tion. Present approach is a frequency-dependent gener-
alization of calculations of static dipole polarizabilities

reported in [19, 24]; technical details can be found in
these works.

The overwhelming contribution (on the order of 90%)
to the value of the van der Waals coeﬃcient, Eq. (1),
comes from the lowest-energy excited nsnp 1P o
1 state.
Therefore the calculated C6 are mostly sensitive to accu-
racies of dipole matrix elements and energy separations
of the principal nsnp 1P o
1 − ns2 1S0 transitions. We ex-
plicitly calculated these quantities using the same level
of CI+MBPT+RPA approximation as employed in the
solution of the inhomogeneous equation (7); these values
are marked as CI+MBPT+RPA and CI+MBPT in Ta-
ble I. We ﬁnd a good agreement with more sophisticated
ab initio [20, 21] and experimental values [4, 25, 26, 27]
(see Table I.) For Be we also computed additional many-
body corrections; they can be neglected at the level of the
quoted signiﬁcant ﬁgures in Table I. We conservatively
estimated an uncertainty in the matrix element for Be as
a half of the diﬀerence between valence CI and correlated
value.

Due to the enhanced sensitivity of C6 to uncertainties
in the dipole matrix element and the energy separation
∆Ep of principal transitions, we further correct the calcu-
lated dynamic polarizability by subtracting the ab initio
CI+MBPT+RPA contribution of the principal transition

from α(iω) and adding it back with experimental energies
and high-accuracy matrix elements compiled in Table I.
The “perturbed” state |δΨωi in Eq. (7) is deﬁned in the
model space of the valence electrons, i.e., it is comprised
from all possible valence excitations from the ground
state |Ψgi. Since the core-excited states do not enter
the model space, their contribution to the polarizability
has to be added separately. Here we follow our work [14]
and use the relativistic random-phase approximation [28]
to determine the dynamic core polarizability as

ergies and fµ are the corresponding electric-dipole oscilla-
tor strengths. Accounting for core excitations is essential
in our accurate calculations, especially for heavier atoms.
For example, for Ba they contribute as much as 15% to
the total value of C6.

The particle-hole excitations summed over in Eq. (10)
include Pauli-principle violating excitations into the oc-
cupied valence shell. We explicitly subtract their contri-
bution; this small correction αcv(iω) is computed with
the Dirac-Hartree-Fock method.

Our calculated dynamic polarizabilities satisfy two im-
portant relations: (i) α(ω = 0) is the ground-state static
dipole polarizability and (ii) as a consequence of the non-
relativistic Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule, at large fre-
quencies ω2 α(iω) → N , where N is the total number of
atomic electrons. Indeed, for Ca we obtain α(0) = 160
a.u., while the experimental value [29] is 169(17) a.u. For
Sr we obtain 199 a.u. which is in agreement with the mea-
sured value [30] of 186(15) a.u. And, ﬁnally, for Ba the
computed static polarizability of 273 a.u. also compares
well with experimental value [30] of 268(22) a.u. Simi-
larly, at large ω, in our calculations the product ω2 α(iω)
approaches 3.99 for Be, 11.9 for Mg, 19.71 for Ca, 37.1 for
Sr, and 54.01 for Ba; these asymptotic relativistic values
are slightly smaller than the exact nonrelativistic limits.
c. Results and theoretical uncertainties. We com-
bine various parts of the dynamic polarizability, Eq. (4),
and then obtain dispersion coeﬃcients C6 with a quadra-
ture, Eq. (2). The resulting values of van der Waals co-
eﬃcients are presented in Table II.
In this Table, val-
ues marked ab initio were determined in the relativistic
CI+MBPT+RPA framework. The values marked ﬁnal
are ab initio values adjusted for accurate dipole matrix
elements and energies of principal transitions, compiled
in Table I.

Diﬀerent classes of intermediate states in Eq. (3) con-
tribute at drastically diﬀerent levels to the total values of
dispersion coeﬃcients. For example, for Ca, the principal
4s4p 1P o
1 −4s2 1S0 transition contributes 85% to the values
of C6, remaining valence-valence excitations contribute
8%, core-excited states contribute 8% and the counter

term αcv modiﬁes the ﬁnal result only by -0.4%. To esti-
mate dominant theoretical uncertainties we approximate
C6 as

(11)

Here αp is a contribution of the principal transition
Eq. (9), and αr = α′
v + αc is a contribution of the re-
maining valence states (α′
v = αv − αp) and core-excited
states. From a direct calculation for Ca we ﬁnd that this
approximation recovers 99.3% of the C6 obtained from
the full expression (2). Based on Eq. (11) the sensitivity
of C6 to uncertainties δD in the matrix element D of the
principal transition is

δDC6 ≈ (4Cpp

(12)

.

To evaluate the sensitivity of C6 to uncertainties in the
residual polarizability we follow Ref. [36]. In the second
term of Eq. (11) a narrow function αp(iω) is integrated
with a relatively broad distribution αr(iω). Therefore we
can approximate that

αp(iω)αr(iω)dω ≈ αr(0)

and the sensitivity of C6 is

δαr C6 ≈ Cpr

δαr(0)

.

(14)

The uncertainty in the residual static polarizability
δαr(0) is a sum of uncertainties in the contributions of va-
lence states beyond principal transition δα′
v(0) and core-
excited states δαc(0). The RRPA static dipole core po-
larizabilities for alkali-metal atoms are known [14] to be
in a 1% agreement with those deduced from semiempir-
ical analysis of Rydberg spectra; we approximate that
δαc(0) ≈ 0.01αc(0). Further we estimate that δα′
v(0) ≈
δαp(0), i.e. the diﬀerence of the contributions of the prin-
cipal transition to static polarizability calculated with
CI+MBPT+RPA and accurate values compiled in Ta-
ble I.

The error bars of the ﬁnal values of dispersion coef-
ﬁcients in Table II were calculated by adding the un-
certainties δDC6 and δαr C6 in quadrature. For all con-
sidered alkaline-earth atoms the uncertainty in C6 in-
duced by errors in matrix elements of principal transi-
tion, δDC6, dominates over δαr C6. The estimated total
uncertainties are in the order of 1-2% for all alkaline-earth
atoms, except for Sr where the accuracy is 5%. Similar
error analysis for alkali-metal atoms [14] has proven to be
reliable; for example, for Cs the predicted C6 = 6851(74)
a.u. was found to be in agreement with a value [37] of
6890(35) a.u. deduced from an analysis of magnetic-ﬁeld
induced Feshbach resonances and photoassociation data.
However, we emphasize that in the case of alkali-metals a

4

number of independent high-accuracy data was available
for the dominant principal transitions ensuring reliability
of derived dispersion coeﬃcients. This is not the case for
alkaline-earth atoms. In our present calculation we rely
on the quoted uncertainties of accurate dipole matrix el-
ements listed in Table I.

A comparison with other theoretical and semiempiri-
cal determinations is presented in Table II. There is a
reasonable agreement among diﬀerent approaches for Be
and Mg; results for Ca are less consistent due to a more
signiﬁcant role of correlations and core-excited states.
Coupled-cluster calculations by Stanton [31] were most
elaborate among theoretical treatments. We ﬁnd a good
agreement with his predictions. Unfortunately, most of
the authors do not estimate uncertainties of their meth-
ods. One of the exceptions is Ref. [32] where sum rules
and Pade-approximants were used to establish bounds on
C6. For Ca, they found 2740 ≤ C6 ≤ 2830 a.u. However,
large uncertainties of underlying experimental data were
not included in these bounds (see also Ref. [31]); this
explains a signiﬁcant deviation of our prediction for Ca,

C6 = 2221(15) a.u., from constraints of Ref. [32].

d. Conclusion. We carried out relativistic many-
body calculations of van der Waals coeﬃcients C6 for
dimers correlating to two ground state alkaline-earth
atoms at large internuclear separations. The values were
adjusted with accurate theoretical and experimental data
for the electric-dipole matrix elements and energies of
the principal transitions. It is worth emphasizing that
the dispersion coeﬃcients depend sensitively on electric-
dipole matrix elements of principal transitions. As more
accurate data for the matrix elements become available,
for example from photoassociation experiments with ul-
tracold samples, the van der Waals coeﬃcients can be
constrained further within our many-body approach.

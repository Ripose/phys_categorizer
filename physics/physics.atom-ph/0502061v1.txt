We present experimental measurements of the mean energy in the vicinity of the ﬁrst and sec-
ond quantum resonances of the atom optics kicked rotor for a number of diﬀerent experimental
parameters. Our data is rescaled and compared with the one parameter ǫ–classical scaling function
developed to describe the quantum resonance peaks. Additionally, experimental data is presented
for the “classical” resonance which occurs in the limit as the kicking period goes to zero. This res-
onance is found to be analogous to the quantum resonances, and a similar one-parameter classical
scaling function is derived, and found to match our experimental results. The width of the quantum
and classical resonance peaks is compared, and their Sub-Fourier nature examined.

INTRODUCTION

The heart of experimentally testing and controlling
classical and quantum systems often lies in the introduc-
tion of an external periodic driving force [1, 2, 3]. The
driving probes system speciﬁc properties, the knowledge
of which allows one, in turn, to understand and to opti-
mally control the system at hand. In particular, driven
systems often exhibit resonance like behavior if the ex-
ternal driving frequency matches the natural frequency
of the unperturbed system.

Typical nonlinear classical systems are resonant for
only a ﬁnite interaction time since the driving itself forces
the system to gain energy and hence drift out of reso-
nance. Only if the natural frequencies are independent of
the energy as for the linear (harmonic) oscillator, can the
system absorb energy on resonance indeﬁnitely. In the
quantum world, the situation may be diﬀerent by virtue
of the unperturbed system possibly having a discrete en-
ergy spectrum.
If this spectrum shows an appropriate
scaling in the excitation quantum number, resonant mo-
tion can persist forever.

A simple example of such a system is provided by the
free rotor, whose energy spectrum scales quadratically in
the excitation quantum number (due to periodic bound-
ary conditions for the motion on the circle). Kicking the
rotor periodically in time with a frequency commensu-
rable with the energy diﬀerence of two neighboring levels
leads to perfectly resonant driving. These so called quan-
tum resonances of the well-studied kicked rotor (KR) [4]
have been known theoretically for some time [5], but the
ﬁrst traces of this example of frequency-matched driving
have only recently come to light in experiments with cold
atoms [6, 7]. Such experiments [7] and theoretical studies
[8, 9] have also shown the surprisingly robust nature of
these resonances in the presence of noise and perturba-
tions.

Experimentally, the quantum resonances of the KR are
hard to detect for two principle reasons. Firstly, only a
relatively small proportion of atoms are kicked resonantly

for the following reason:
ideally, the atomic motion is
along a line, which introduces an additional parameter,
namely the non-integer part of the atomic momentum,
i.e.
the atom’s quasi-momentum. Treating the atoms
independently, their motion can be mapped onto the cir-
cle owing to the spatial periodicity of the standing wave,
which makes the quasi-momentum a constant of the mo-
tion. However, only some values of quasi-momentum al-
low resonant driving to occur [5]. All other values induce
a dephasing in the evolution which hinders the resonant
kicking of the atoms (see Section III for details). Sec-
ondly, if an atom is kicked resonantly it moves extremely
quickly; in fact its energy grows quadratically in time (so-
called ballistic propagation). These fast atoms quickly
escape any ﬁxed experimental detection window after a
suﬃciently large number of kicks [6, 7].

In this paper, we report experimental data which shows
the behavior of a typical experimental ensemble of cold
atoms under resonant driving. Our main observable is
the mean energy of the atomic ensemble measured after
a ﬁxed number of kicks and scanned over the resonant
kicking frequency or period. We verify a recently derived
single-parameter scaling law of the resonant peak seen
the period [8, 10, 11].
when scanning the energy vs.
The scaling law allows us, for the ﬁrst time, to clearly
resolve the resonance peak structure because it reduces
the dynamics to a stationary and experimentally robust
signature of the quantum resonant motion.

After a short review of our experimental setup in Sec-
tion II and the theoretical treatment of the atom-optics
kicked rotor close to quantum resonance in Section III, we
present experimental data for the mean energies around
the ﬁrst two fundamental quantum resonances of the
kicked atom. From this data, we extract the afore men-
tioned scaling law in Section IV. The eﬀect of the quasi-
momentum (as a typical quantum variable) on the mo-
tion disappears in the classical limit of the kicked rotor,
when the kicking period approaches zero [5, 12]. In the
latter case, the rotor is constantly driven, and a ballistic
motion occurs for all members of the atomic ensemble

FIG. 1: Schematic diagram of our experimental set up. A standard six beam magneto optical trap (MOT) of about 105
Cs atoms is formed inside a vacuum cell at the intersection of 3 retroreﬂected “trapping” beams (vertical beams and (anti)
Helmholtz coils are not shown). A standing wave is formed across the cloud of atoms by retroreﬂecting light from a “kicking
laser”, which is transported to the MOT by means of a single mode ﬁbre (SMF). This light is pulsed on and oﬀ by an acousto–
optic modulator (AOM) which is gated by a programmable pulse generator (PPG). The PPG’s pulse train is uploaded from a
computer, which also controls the timing of the experiment (e.g. when the trapping AOM and anti–Helmholtz coils are turned
on and oﬀ).

[13]. Both phenomena, the quantum and the “classical”
(for vanishing kicking period) resonance are related to
one another by a purely classical theory developed pre-
viously for the quantum resonance peaks [8, 10, 11].

In Section V we focus on the ﬁrst direct comparison
of the behavior of the ensemble averaged energies in the
case of the “classical” and the quantum resonance. In
particular, the Sub-Fourier scaling of the resonance peaks
in the mean energy as a function of the kick number is
discussed. The latter makes both types of resonances
studied here a potential source of high-precision mea-
surements of system speciﬁc parameters.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Our experimental system is a realization of the
paradigmatic kicked rotor (KR) model [14, 15], whose
relevance lies in the fact that it shows the basic features
of a complex dynamical system, and it may be used to
locally (in energy) approximate much more complicated
systems, such as microwave-driven Rydberg atoms [16],
or an ion in a particle accelerator [1, 17].

Our experiments utilise a cloud of about 105 cold Cae-
sium atoms, provided by a standard six beam magneto–
optical trap (MOT) [18]. The typical momentum spread
of the atomic sample lies between 4 and 8 two–photon
recoils. The shape of the initial momentum distribution
is well approximated by a Gaussian with standard de-
2~kL, centered at zero momen-
viation σp ≃
tum [19], although signiﬁcant non–Gaussian tails can ex-

ist [13]. The width is measured in units of two–photon
recoils, corresponding to the wavelength of the kicking
laser λL = 2π/kL. The fractional parts in these units of
the initial momenta, i.e. the quasi-momentum discussed
below, are practically uniformly distributed in the fun-
damental Brillouin zone deﬁned by the periodic kick po-
tential [10].

∼

TM

As shown in Fig. 1, the atoms interact with a pulsed,
far-detuned optical standing wave which is created by
retroreﬂecting the light from a 150mW (slave) diode
laser which is injection locked to a lower power (mas-
ter) diode laser at a wavelength of λL = 852 nm. Power
ﬂuctuations were minimal during the experiments per-
formed here (
1%) although larger drifts occurred over
the course of many experimental runs. Accurate pulse
timing is achieved using a custom built programmable
pulse generator (PPG) to gate an acousto–optic modu-
lator. The PPG is programmed by a computer running
operating system kernel [20] which con-
the RTLinux
trols the timing of the experimental sequence (aside from
the pulse train itself). Experimentally, we approximate
δ-kicks by pulses of width τp which are approximately
rectangular in shape. The lowest value of τp used in our
experiments was 240 ns and the highest was 480 ns. For
the experiments reported here, the eﬀect of the ﬁnite
width of the kicking pulses [19, 22] turns out to be neg-
ligible, since fairly small numbers of kicks (less than 20)
and low kicking strengths are used. In the case where the
τ
0 limit is being investigated experimentally, the δ–
kick assumption is clearly not valid [13, 21]. This restricts
us to a minimum period τ = 330 ns, for τp = 240 ns, in

→

our study of the “classical” resonance peaks.

In a typical experimental run, the cooled atoms were
released from the MOT and subjected to up to 16 stand-
ing wave pulses, then allowed to expand for an addi-
tional free drift time in order to resolve the atomic mo-
menta. After this expansion time, the trapping beam is
switched on and the atoms are frozen in space by optical
mollases. A CCD image of the resulting ﬂuorescence is
recorded and used to infer the momentum distribution
of the atoms using standard time of ﬂight techniques [6].
The mean energy of the atomic ensemble may then be
inferred by calculating the second moment of the exper-
imental momentum distribution.

Kicking laser powers of up to 30 mW were employed,
6P3/2(F ′ = 5)
and detunings from the 6S1/2(F = 4)
transition of Cesium of 500 MHz and 1 GHz were used for
the classical and quantum resonance scans respectively.
These parameters produced spontaneous emission rates
of < 0.5% per kick for the quantum resonance scans,
which was low enough to ensure that the structure of
the peaks was not aﬀected for the low kick numbers used
here.

ǫ-CLASSICAL DYNAMICS NEAR THE

FUNDAMENTAL QUANTUM RESONANCES

We now consider the theoretical treatment of the atom-
optics kicked rotor near quantum resonance. The Hamil-
tonian that generates the time evolution of the atomic
wave function is (in dimensionless form) [6, 14]

where p is the atomic momentum in units of 2~kL (i.e. of
two-photon recoils), z is the atomic position in units of
2kL, t′ is time and t is an integer which counts the kicks.
In our units, the kicking period τ may also be viewed
as a scaled Planck constant as deﬁned by the equation
τ = 8ERT /~, where ER = ~2k2
L/2M is the recoil energy
(associated with the energy change of a Caesium atom of
mass M after emission of a photon of wavelength λL =
2π/kL = 852 nm). The dimensionless parameter k is the
kicking strength of the system and is proportional to the
kicking laser intensity.

An atom periodically kicked in space and time is de-
scribed by a wave packet ψ(z) decomposed into 2π-
periodic Bloch states ψβ(z), that is,

ψ(z) =

dβ exp(iβz)ψβ(z) ,

where β is the quasi-momentum (i.e. the fractional part

evolution generated by (1), so the diﬀerent Bloch states
in (2) evolve independently of each other, whereby their
momenta can change only by integers by virtue of the

kicks. For any given quasi-momentum, the dynamics is
formally equivalent to that of a rotor (moving on a circle)

motion: if τ = 2πr/q (r, q integers) then the atomic mo-
tion may show asymptotic quadratic growth in energy so

time. Under these conditions the Floquet operator (3) is
also periodic in momentum space, with the integer period
q. As in previous experimental studies [6], we focus on
the ﬁrst two fundamental quantum resonances q = 1, 2,
for which the amplitudes of Bloch waves with β = 1/2 for
q = 2, and β = 0, 1/2 for q = 1 at momentum states sep-
2~kL exactly rephase after each kick. The
arated by q
rephasing condition enforces ballistic propagation of the
corresponding states in momentum space, so their energy
grows quadratically in time. The remaining Bloch com-
ponents of the original wave packet (2), with β not in the
resonant class, exchange energy with the kicking laser in
a quasiperiodic manner. The competition between the
resonant and the non-resonant subclasses of Bloch states
(between ballistic and quasi-periodic propagation) leads
k2t/4,
to linear growth of the total mean energy, E
obtained by incoherently averaging over the the contin-
uous set of quasi-momenta which constitute the atomic
ensemble [8, 10, 11].

For q = 1, 2, we write τ = 2πℓ + ǫ, where ǫ denotes
the detuning from the exact resonance and l = 1, 2. As
shown in [10, 11], the Floquet operator (3), can then be

The one-parameter scaling law (8) allows us to deduce
the shape and the parameter dependence of the resonance
peaks elegantly from the experimental data, which in the
unscaled form is shown in the Figs. 2 and 3 for τ = 2π
and τ = 4π, respectively.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF THE
SCALING LAW AT QUANTUM RESONANCE

We have used the data obtained for various scans of the
mean energy vs. the kicking period around the quantum
resonances τ = 2π and τ = 4π, and for kick numbers
t = 5, 10, 15 to extract the ratio hEt,ǫi
hEt,0i . We subtract
from the numerator the initial energy of the atomic en-
semble with the characteristic width in momentum space
σp. The contribution of σ2
p/2 to the energy must be
subtracted because the derivation of the scaling function
R(x) assumed an initial atomic momentum distribution

in the unit interval [0, 1) [10], corresponding to a uniform
distribution of quasi-momenta β
[0, 1). Since the

maximum of the resonance peak
tally the most unstable parameter (due to the early loss
of the fastest resonant atoms from the experimental de-
tection window [6, 7, 8]), we use the theoretical value
p/2 = k2t/4 to rescale our experimental data,

rather than the height of the experimental peak itself.
Results are presented in Figs. 4 and 5 for τ = 2π, 4π
respectively. We see very good agreement between the
theoretical scaling function R(x) from Eq. (8) and our
experimental data. Despite the relatively large experi-
mental errors due to the uncertainty in the determination
of σp (see discussion below), the data shows the charac-
teristic structure, and also the oscillations arising from
8.

These oscillations arise from the averaged contributions
of the initial conditions J 0 ∈
2, 2) within the principal
nonlinear resonance island, which evolve with diﬀerent
frequencies around the corresponding elliptic ﬁxed point
of the map (6). The quasi-momentum classes contribut-
ing to G(x) are thus the near-resonant values, whilst the
non-resonant values contribute to the function 1
Φ0(x),
which saturates to a constant for large x [8, 10, 11].

We ﬁtted k and σp for each data set and then used
these ﬁtted parameters to scale our data.
In the case
of the τ = 2π data, the best ﬁt value of k was found
to be 4.5 compared to the independently measured value
of k = 4.1
0.6. For the τ = 4π data, the best ﬁt
value of k was 5.2 compared with a measured value of
k = 5
0.5. The corresponding ﬁtted values of σp were 5
and 5.2 two–photon recoils respectively which diﬀer from
the measured values of 4.53
0.2. This
diﬀerence is due to the systematic error involved in de-
termining σp from the experimental initial momentum
distribution (as discussed in [13]). In particular this dis-
tribution may have noisy exponential wings [19] which
must truncated in order to reliably extract the second
moment leading to an underestimation of the true initial
momentum spread.

It is interesting to note that in Figs. 2 and 3, there
is noticeable asymmetry in the resonance peaks. This
degree of asymmetry is not predicted by the standard
ǫ–classical theory and its precise cause has not yet been
ascertained. However, the asymmetry most likely stems
from one or more systematic experimental eﬀects, in-
cluding the eﬀect of small amounts of spontaneous emis-
sion (< 0.5% chance per kick for the quantum resonance
scans) and also from the slightly lesser time of ﬂight ex-
perienced by atoms for positive as opposed to negative
ǫ. Asymmetry of the peaks has also been noted in other
experiments probing the structure of the quantum reso-
nances [24]. In any case, this asymmetry does not pre-
vent us from observing the structure of the quantum res-
onances, but leads to a slightly enhanced scatter of the
experimental data points in Figs. 4 and 5.

V. CLASSICAL LIMIT OF VANISHING
KICKING PERIOD

In spite of

the intrinsically quantum nature of
the quantum resonances as an example of perfectly
frequency-matched driving, the method reviewed in Sec-
tion III allows us to map the quantum dynamics onto
a purely classical map given by (6). The latter map is
formally equivalent to the usual Standard Map, which
describes the classical limit of the quantum KR when
the kicking period tends to zero [12]:

Jt+1 = Jt + ˜k sin(θt+1) , θt+1 = θt + Jt ,

(9)

now with J = τ p = τ (n + β), and ˜k = kτ . Because of
the analogy between the maps (6) and (9), we expect a
scaling law for the mean energy also in the limit τ
0.
Since τ
0, all quasi-momentum subclasses contribute
now similarly to the energy growth, and the averaged
energy is given only by the initial conditions within the
principal nonlinear resonance island (see [13] for details):

Gcl(x)
scribes quadratic growth in mean energy as τ
0. We
note again that in the case of quantum resonances, ǫ-
classical theory predicts only linear mean energy growth
with kick number at quantum resonance [10, 11]. This
linear increase is induced by the contribution of most
quasi-momentum classes which lie outside the classical
resonance island. For τ
0, almost all initial conditions
(or quasi-momenta) lie within the principal resonance is-
land, which leads to the ballistic growth for the averaged
ensemble energy (10).

since Gcl saturates to the value α

Within the stated parameter range, this result implies
dynamical freezing – the ensemble’s mean energy is inde-
pendent of kick number. This phenomenon is a classical
eﬀect in a system with a regular phase space, and has
been observed in [13] for the ﬁrst time.
It is distinct
from dynamical localization which is the quantum sup-
pression of momentum diﬀusion for a chaotic phase space
[4, 12]. Experimentally, the freezing eﬀect corresponds to
the cessation of energy absorption from the kicks, similar
(but diﬀerent in origin) to that which occurs at dynam-
ical localization. The freezing may be explained as the
averaging over all trajectories which start at momenta
close to zero, and move with diﬀerent frequencies about
the principal elliptic ﬁxed point of the map (9).

From Eq. (12), we immediately see that for the “clas-
sical” resonance τ
0, the resonant peak width scales in
time like (kt2)−1, as at the quantum resonances studied
in Sections III and IV. However, the tails of the classi-
1/x2) than those
cal resonance peak decay faster (as
at quantum resonance (as
1/x, c.f. Eq. (8)). This
∝
very fast shrinking of both types of resonance peaks is
compared in Figs. 6 and 7.

∝

Both types of these sensitive resonance peaks may
serve as an experimental tool for determining or calibrat-
ing parameters in a very precise manner. Additionally,
we note that the quadratic scaling in time at the quantum
resonances and the “classical” resonance, respectively, is
much faster and hence much more sensitive than the Sub-
Fourier resonances detected in a similar context by Szrift-
gizer and co-workers [25]. A detailed study of the quan-
tum energy spectrum of the kicked atoms close to the two
types of resonances is under way to clarify the origin of
the observed Sub-Fourier scaling of the resonance peaks.

FIG. 6:
(a) Circles show experimentally measured mean en-
ergies as τ → 0 after 5 kicks. The measured value of k is
4.9 ± 0.2. The solid line is classical data for k = 4.9, as gener-
ated by the map (9), using practically the same initial momen-
tum distribution as in the experiment. The thermal energy
σ2
p/2 has been subtracted to facilitate comparison with the
quantum resonance curve in (b). In (b), circles show experi-
mental data after 5 kicks near the second quantum resonance
for positive ǫ = τ − 4π and the experimental parameters are
as given for Fig. 3. The thermal energy σ2
p/2 has been sub-
tracted. The solid line is ǫ–classical data as generated by the
map (6).

FIG. 7: (a) Circles show experimental data as τ → 0 for 10
kicks. The other experimental parameters are the same as
those given for Fig. 6(a). The circles in (b) show experimen-
tal data once again for the second quantum resonance after
10 kicks this time. Other experimental parameters are the
same as those given for Fig. 6(b). We note that for the quan-
tum resonance in (b), the simulation and experimental results
diﬀer most markedly near the resonance peak. In this region
(ǫ <
∼ 0.03), some fast, resonant atoms are being lost from the
experimental viewing area leading to a lower energy growth
rate than predicted theoretically (see discussion in Sections
I and II). Note that in (a), it is not possible to probe low
values of τ = ǫ due to the ﬁnite width of the pulses.

→

Finally, we have plotted rescaled experimental data for
the τ
0 resonance against the scaling function of Eq.
(12), as seen in Fig. 8. The scaling was performed using
the ﬁtted parameters as given in Figs. 6 and 7. We
note that it is more diﬃcult to extract the scaling from
experimental data in the classical case, as opposed to
the quantum case, because the peak of the extremely
narrow resonance is diﬃcult to probe. This leads to a
larger uncertainty in the scaled energy and the points
appear somewhat more scattered than those in Figs. 4
and 5. However, the points clearly agree much better
with the classical scaling function from (12) than the ǫ-
classical scaling function (8) which is shown in Fig. 8 as
a dash-dotted line. The clearly diﬀerent scaling of the
quantum and the “classical” resonant peaks goes along
with the same rates at which the peaks become narrower
with time in a Sub-Fourier manner.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have experimentally conﬁrmed a theo-
retically predicted one-parameter scaling law for the res-
onance peaks in the mean energy of a periodically kicked
cold atomic ensemble. This scaling of the resonant peaks
is universal, in the sense that it reduces the dependence
from all the system’s parameters to just one combina-
tion of such variables. Furthermore, the scaling theory

Eq. (8) (valid for the quantum resonances) for comparison.

works in principle for arbitrary initial momentum distri-
butions. In particular, it is valid for the experimentally
relevant uniformly distributed quasi-momenta at the fun-
damental quantum resonances of the kicked atoms. In
the classical limit of vanishing kicking period, the de-
pendence on quasi-momentum, as an intrinsic quantum
variable, disappears entirely, leading to a simpler version
of the scaling law. The discussed scaling of the experi-
mental data oﬀers one the possibility to clearly observe
the quantum and “classical” resonant peak structure over
more than one order of magnitude in the scaling variable.
Furthermore, its sensitive dependence on the system’s pa-
rameters may be useful for high-precision calibration and
measurements.

It will be of great interest to clarify whether a sim-
ilar universal scaling law can be found for other time-
dependent systems, such as the close–to–resonant dy-
namics of the kicked harmonic oscillator [26], or the

driven Harper model [27, 28]. As with the atom-optics
kicked rotor, both of the latter systems may be readily
realized in laboratory experiments [29, 30].

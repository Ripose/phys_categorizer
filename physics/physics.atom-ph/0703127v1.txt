Abstract

Antiprotonic helium, a neutral exotic three-body system consisting of a helium
nucleus, an electron and an antiproton, is being studied at the Antiproton Decel-
erator of CERN by the ASAUCSA collaboration. Using laser spectroscopy of the
energy levels of the antiproton in this system and comparison to theory, a value
of the antiproton-to-electron mass ratio with an error of 3 ppb could be obtained.
This result agrees with the most precise measurement of the value of the proton
and allows us to extract a limit of the equality of the proton and antiproton charge
and mass of 2 ppb. Using microwave spectroscopy, the hyperﬁne structure of an-
tiprotonic helium has been measured to 30 ppm. Experimental improvements are
expected to soon provide a new value for the magnetic moment of the antiproton.

Introduction

Initially discovered at KEK in 1991 [1], antiprotonic helium has been studied exten-
sively at LEAR [2] and the Antiproton Decelerator (AD) of CERN. It is an exotic 3-body
system p – e− – He2+ or short pHe+, where the antiproton occupies highly excited
metastable states with principal quantum number n and angular momentum quan-
tum number l of (n, l) ∼ 33 . . . 39. Its average lifetime of ∼ 3 µs allows access to the
antiproton energy levels by laser and microwave spectroscopy. The energy levels of
pHe+ are shown in Fig. 1. Using laser spectroscopy, the levels (n, l) have been deter-
mined with high precision which allows a determination of the antiproton charge and
mass as described below. Microwave spectroscopy gives access to the hyperﬁne struc-
ture and therefore to the magnetic moment of the antiproton, a quantity that is known
so far to only 0.3%.

Both measurements constitute a precise test of CPT symmetry in the baryon sector.
Fig. 2 compares such tests for different cases including predictions for antihydrogen
(light colours) which will not be discussed here. The blue bars correspond to values
which can be extracted from the particle data group compilation [3]: shown are the rel-
ative differences between particle and antiparticle properties. This way of comparing
different tests of CPT, however, is misleading as quite different quantities are com-
pared for different sectors (leptons, mesons, baryons, atoms!) and it is known that e.g.

CP violation only occurs in the meson sector. A better way of comparing CPT tests
in different sectors has ﬁrst been suggested in the framework of the Standard Model
Extension (SME) by Kostelecky et al. [4]. In his phenomenological model, CPT and
Lorentz invariance violating terms are added to the Dirac equation to describe possi-
ble symmetry breakings. This implies that the parameters, which can be determined
from experiment, have an absolute dimension of energy. Kostelecky and his groups
analyzed many possible experiments and arrived at the limits which are shown as red
bars in Fig. 2 [5–8]. In this context it becomes evident that the most precise tests of CPT

energy scale are measured to extremely high precision.

2 Charge and mass of the antiproton

The fact that the p survives for several microseconds in pHe+ while undergoing radia-
tive transitions whose wavelengths lie in the visible region made it well suited for laser
spectroscopy. The technique developed called “forced annihilation” made use of the
additional fact that antiprotons mostly follow cascades with ∆n = ∆l = −1 or ∆v = 0
with v = n − l − 1 being the vibrational quantum number. At the end of each such
cascade of Fig. 1 there is a pair of adjacent metastable and short-lived states. When the
laser is on resonance, the antiproton is transferred to the short-lived state and annihi-
lates immediately, leading to a sharp spike in the DATS (Delayed Annihilation Time
Spectrum).

The experimental accuracy has been steadily improved, from 0.5 ppm achieved
at the end of LEAR to currently 2 ppb. A ﬁrst major improvement came from the
construction of a radio frequency quadrupole decelerator, RFQD, in a joint venture of
the ASACUSA collaboration and the CERN PS division [9]. This RFQD decelerates the
AD beam from 5 MeV to 60–120 keV, thus allowing to stop antiprotons in helium gas
of three orders of magnitude less density. This way, the dominating systematic error
of density shifts of the transition wavelengths could be avoided. By comparing the
experimental results with two independent theoretical calculations, a CPT limit of 10
ppb on the maximum relative difference of charge and mass of the antiproton could be
established [10] as discussed below.

The next step in accuracy came with utilizing pulse-ampliﬁed cw lasers that were
locked to a frequency comb. With this method, the two now dominant sources of sys-
tematic errors: the laser band width and the absolute calibration of its wavelength,
could be strongly reduced. Again the same 13 transitions were measured and com-
pared to the remaining theory that agrees well with the data. By taking the antiproton-
to-electron mass ratio Mp/me as a free parameter in the theory and ﬁtting all data
points for the various transitions, a value of Mp/me = 1836.152 674 (5) was deduced,
which is in good agreement with the latest proton value from CODATA (cf. Fig. 3 left)
[11]. The error on this ﬁgure is about 3 ppb.

This treatment assumes, that the charge of proton and antiproton have the same
value of |e|. However, as was pointed out by Hughes and Deutch earlier [12], the
independent limits on the charge of p and p are much less, about |Qp − Qp|/e < 2 ×
10−5.
In order to extract independent limits for both charge and mass, one can go
the following way: The TRAP collaboration at LEAR [13] has measured Q/M to a
precision of ∼ 10−10. The measured transitions wave length of pHe+ are dominated
by the Rydberg constant which is ∝ MQ2. As layed out in [2, 14], one can use both
measurements to get separate limits of Q and M. Fig. 3 right illustrates this procedure:
the allowed region for charge and mass of the antiproton is where the two areas of
opposite-sign slope intersect.

measurements of TRAP (Q/M) and ASACUSA (MQ2) to extract individual limits on
antiproton and proton charge and mass.

In general, each measured transition frequency depends in a slightly different way

on charge and mass than in the simple model used above. The relation becomes

with f = 2 − 5 being a transition-dependent “sensitivity factor” obtained by the-
ory. The ﬁnal result is obtained by averaging over all measured transitions. Since the
TRAP measurement of Q/M is still one order of magnitude more precise the the pHe+
spectroscopy, the errors on the individual properties is given by the ASACUSA error
of 2 ppb [11].

A further improvement from this point is only possible by using two-phtoton spec-
troscopy, since the line width is now dominated by Doppler broadening. A ﬁrst test
was done in 2006 and the results look encouraging.

3 Magnetic moment of the antiproton

The energy levels in antiprotonic helium which were so far denoted by principle n
and angular momentum quantum number l exhibit a hyperﬁne (HF) structure due to
the magnetic interaction of the constituents of pHe+. Since the electron in pHe+ is
predominantly in the ground state, the total angular momentum (cid:126)l is equal to the one
of the antiproton, (cid:126)Lp. The magnetic moment of p is given by the sum of angular and
spin terms

and the interaction of the two magnetic moments leads to an unusual splitting: the
two largest moments, the p angular moment and the electron spin create the dominant
splitting following (cid:126)F= (cid:126)Lp + (cid:126)Se called hyperﬁne (HF) splitting, and the p spin leads to a
further splitting according to the total angular momentum (cid:126)J = (cid:126)F + (cid:126)Sp = (cid:126)Lp + (cid:126)Se + (cid:126)Sp.
The latter is called superhyperﬁne splitting (SHF), and the resulting quadruplet structure
is shown in Fig. 1 right.

The hyperﬁne structure of pHe+ has ﬁrst been calculated by Bakalov and Ko-
robov [15], who showed that the HF splitting is in the order of νHF= 10 − 15 GHz
for the metastable states, while the SHF splitting is two orders of magnitude smaller
(νSHF = 100 − 300 MHz). They furthermore showed that the difference of hyper-
ﬁne splittings in laser transitions is very small for favoured transitions with ∆v = 0
(so-called because of the larger dipole transition moment), but exceeds the experi-
mental resolution of ∼ 1 GHz in unfavoured ∆v = 2 transitions. A scan of the
(n, L) = (37, 35) → (38, 34) transition done in the last year of LEAR indeed revealed a
doublet structure with a splitting of ∆νHF= (1.70 ± 0.5) GHz [16], in accoradance with
the theoretical value of 1.77 GHz [15].

In this experiment, the difference of the HF splittings of the two states (37, 35) and
(38, 34) was measured to about 3% precision. In order to directly observe HF transi-
tions within one state (n, L) and to determine the HF splitting to much higher preci-
sion, we devised a laser-microwave-laser resonance method which works as follows:
The wavy lines in Fig. 1 right represent allowed M1 transitions (ﬂipping (cid:126)Se but not (cid:126)Sp)
which can be induced by microwave radiation. All the HF levels are initially nearly
equally populated. In order to create a population asymmetry which is needed to de-
tect a microwave transition, a laser pulse at time t1 stimulating a transition from a
metastable (τ ∼ µs) state to a short-lived (τ (cid:46) 10 ns) state can be used. When the p
is excited to the short-lived state, the pHe+undergoes an Auger transition to a pHe2+
ion which is immediately destroyed via collisional Stark-effect in the dense helium
medium followed by annihilation of the p with a nucleon. An second on-resonance
laser pulse at t2 therefore superposes a sharp spike onto the analog delayed annihila-
tion spectrum (ADATS) whose area is proportional to the population of the metastable
state at the time of the arrival of the laser pulse.

The experiment has been performed at the AD and the result indeed showed the
expected two resonance lines (cf. Fig. 4 left, [17]). The two lines were measured with
a relative accuracy of ∼ 3 × 10−5 and agreed with most theoretical calculations at a
level of ∼ 6 × 10−5, which is comparable to the expected accuracy of the calculations
originating from the omission of terms of relative order α2 ≈ 5 × 10−5 (cf. Fig. 4 right).
The width of the resonance lines of (5.3 ± 0.7) MHz is given by the Fourier limit caused
by the time distance of ∆t = t2 − t1 = 160 ns between the two laser pulses, leading to
an expected width of ∆νMW = 1/∆t = 6.25 MHz.

the orbital g-factor gp

The agreement between theory and experiment can be used to constrain the values

of the magnetic moment of the antiproton. Since the observed transitions νHF
a spin ﬂip of the electron, they are primarily sensitive to the orbital magnetic moment
(cid:96) . The results imply |gp
(cid:96) −1| < 6 × 10−5. This result is
of p, i.e.
unique since no corresponding value for the proton has ever been measured due to the
absence of protonic atoms in our matter-dominated world.
The spin magnetic moment (cid:126)µp (or equivalently gp

s ) is of greater importance for tests
of CPT, since it is a direct property of the antiproton, and its value so far is known only
to a precision of ∼ 0.3% [3] from the measurement of X-rays of antiprotonic lead [21].
± transi-
As recently shown by Bakalov and Widmann [22], the sensitivity of the νHF
tions on (cid:126)µp is rather small and their measurement do not promise an improvement
of the current PDG value. The difference ∆νHF = ν−
HF, however, is equal to the
difference of SHF splittings ν+
SHF and is therefore directly sensitive to (cid:126)µp. The
±, and using a sensitiv-
experimental error in ∆νHF is much larger than the one of νHF
ity factor from [22], the current experimental precision corresponds to an uncertainty
in (cid:126)µp of ∼ 1.6%.

SHF – ν−

HF – ν+

An improvement of the experimental precision is only possible if the line width
can be reduced, i.e. the laser pulse distance ∆t can be prolonged. Using the new pulse-
ampliﬁed cw-laser developed by ASACUSA in 2004, ﬁrst tests were performed in 2006
showing that this is indeed possible. An improvement of the experimental precision
of an order of magnitude would be expected, which should allow to determine (cid:126)µp to
0.1% or better.

4 Summary

Antiprotonic helium continues to provide one of the most precise tests of CPT in the
baryon sector. For charge and mass of the antiproton, an accuracy of 2 ppb has been
reached and the use of Doppler-free two-photon spectroscopy promises further im-
provement. The hyperﬁne structure has been determined with high precision which

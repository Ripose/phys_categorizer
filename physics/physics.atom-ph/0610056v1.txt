Abstract

A new dimensional scaling method for the calculation of excited states of multielectron atoms is

introduced. By including the principle and orbital quantum numbers in the dimension parameter,

we obtain an energy expression for excited states including high angular momentum states. The

method is tested on He, Li, and Be. We obtain good agreement with more orthodox quantum

mechanical treatments even in the zeroth order.

INTRODUCTION

The dimensional scaling (D-scaling) method originally developed by Witten [1] and Her-

schbach [2] is now a well established technique in atomic physics [3]. Substantial progress

has been made in improving the accuracy of the technique and extending it to excited states.

Most notable are the approaches of Goodson and Herschbach [4, 5, 6] and the dimensional

perturbation theory (DPT) developed by Carzoli, Dunn, and Watson [7, 8]. In the present

work, an alternative approach to generalized D-scaling is developed which does not require

calculations of high order 1/D corrections in order to obtain high-angular momentum states

unlike, for example, the Pad´e approximate used by Goodson which required 20 orders of 1/D.

Our approach is simple and yet accurate. It predicts excited states of helium (the canonical

multi-electron problem) and is easily extended to N electron atoms. We demonstrate the

straight forward extension by analyzing lithium and beryllium.

II. TWO APPROACHES TO D-SCALING

In this section, we will review the traditional D-scaling approach for helium and introduce

our alternative quantum number dimensional formulation.

A. Traditional D-scaling for helium

The Hamiltonian for helium, in atomic units, is given by

+ V (r1, r2, θ).

When this energy expression is minimized with respect to the parameters (r1, r2, θ), an
estimate of the ground state (1s2) energy of helium can be obtained which is 5% accurate.

The accuracy can be improved by the 1/D expansion. The limitation of this approach is

that expression (7) cannot produce excited S states nor higher-angular momentum states

(states with L > 0) in its current form without resorting to Langmuir vibrations and high

order 1/D corrections.

B. Present D-scaling for helium

Motivated by the approach of the previous section and to avoid high order dimensional

perturbation expansions, we invented a generalized Laplacian of the form

Without loss of generality, we then factor our parameters into a ﬁnite integer part multiplied

Thus, γi and α will tend toward

faster than D provided ni and L are ﬁnite positive inte-

∞

gers greater than one. By introducing the parameters ni and L, into the usual D dimensional

Laplacian, we will have additional degrees of freedom in the ﬁnal energy expression. This

parameterization can be interpreted as being the cardinality of a space larger than D di-

mensions which includes the energy levels of the physical system. We will refer to this space

as quantum number dimensional space. If we need to recover the usual three dimensional

Laplacian, we can add a second term to Eq. 9 given by

γ1 = n1(D

1) + 6(1

n1)/D

γ2 = n2(D

α = L(D

This parameterization allows us to recover the usual three dimensional Schr¨odinger equation

when D = 3. But for large values of D, system 9 and system 10 are the same. In γ

α

space, the corresponding Jacobian factor now reads

The derivation of this expression is given in the Appendix A. Additionally, in the Ap-

pendix B we show how to correct the energy with the ﬁrst 1/D correction. Equation (12) will

allow us to obtain atomic excited states by associating ni as the principle quantum number

for electron i and L as the sum of the individual hydrogenic assignment orbital quantum

numbers i.e. L = ℓ1 + ℓ2. Thus, our L is the maximum in the set of possible total orbital

for a Bohr model of helium using the Bohr space quantization condition for the kinetic

energy operators i.e. 2πr = nλ where λ is the de Broglie wavelength λ = h/p. Bohr space

quantization was also used by Greenspan [9] to obtain an energy expression for the excited

states of helium but with a potential function that was parametrized. More recently, the

Bohr model has been successfully applied to molecules [10, 11, 12, 13]. Here, we take the

electron-nuclear and electron-electron interaction to have their usual Coulombic form. The

results for excited S states are presented in Table I. We see that a dominant feature is the

increase in accuracy with larger quantum number n2. This can easily be explained in terms

of Bohr correspondence. Physically, as n2 > n1(= 1) the corresponding radii will be very
diﬀerent since ri ∼
therefore it is a hydrogenic problem, which is exactly soluble in the Bohr picture.

[3] and references therein) to use D-scaling for these states. We present here, for the ﬁrst

time, a true Lewis structure picture for helium excited states thus providing an example of a

classical analogue for P states. Physically, the P and D states are just special conﬁgurations

of the two electron system in hyperspherical coordinates. Table II compares the energy of

the He atom for some states with L > 0 obtained in the present analysis with the accurate

values known in the literature. Table III shows the conﬁgurations of the electrons for some
representative states. We have found that pure S states admit an angle of 180◦ whereas states
with P character and higher-angular momenta typically lie in the range of 90◦ < θ < 180◦.

We cannot, with this method, distinguish between singlet and triplet states of helium nor

can we determine the correct spectroscopic assignment of L. We note that in general, our

method ﬁnds a value somewhere near the average of the various L states. For example, the

2p2 1Se state energy is

0.62 a.u. whereas for the 2p2 3P e state E

0.71 a.u. and

≈ −

≈ −

6

the average of the two yields

0.67 a.u. which is much closer to our result of

0.68 a.u.

−

−

However, our calculated energy is only 0.29% diﬀerent from the 1D state. This suggests

that our L is indeed the sum of the individual ℓi s.

Our advantage over the dimensional perturbation treatment is twofold. Firstly, in order

to calculate the excited states of helium they needed to invoke harmonic oscillator wave-

functions as an ansatz to the problem. The various excited modes of the normal coordinates

corresponded to the hydrogenic excited states of helium. Their harmonic oscillator quantum

numbers where associated with the radial and orbital nodes of the hydrogenic wavefunctions

(see for example [17]). In order to calculate with this method, many orders of 1/Dn (in the

1/D expansion) where required. Furthermore, it was seen that the 1/D series was asymptotic

and required further re-summation via Pad´e approximates. The second drawback was the

fact that it could only consider states where ℓ1 = ℓ2. Thus, the 1s2p state is not accounted

for in their treatment.

The states with electron 1 in an s-orbit and electron 2 in a higher angular momentum

state seem to work the best. We can correct the errors by considering small vibrations

about the “frozen” conﬁguration positions. The derivation of the ﬁrst 1/D correction and

its application are provided in the Appendix B for the excited states of helium.

V. GENERALIZATION TO THE N-ELECTRON SYSTEM

The present approach admits a simple generalization to the N electron atom with nuclear

charge Z. We can describe the N electron system by including all pairwise interactions.

The problem will thus involve (1/2)N(N + 1) parameters. Let

is 3.5% diﬀerent from the true ground state of

7.4780. However, the accuracy of higher

−

states (including ℓi > 0) is typically much better (see table IV). Additionally, we tested the

method on beryllium and had some success. In this study, we considered states with the core

electrons ﬁxed in the 1s2 orbits. We found an error with respect to published values of 2.6

percent. To eliminate this systematic error, we subtracted oﬀ the ground state error from

each of the excited states and found very good agreement with published results. Shown

in the table V are some calculated excited states of beryllium which are compared to other

(17)

(18)

(19)

published results.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have introduced an alternative form of dimensional scaling for the excited states of

atoms. By treating the principle and orbital quantum numbers to be innately coupled to the

dimension D, we developed an algebraic equation for multiple excited states of multielectron

atoms including states of high orbital momentum. This method can be extended to include

relativistic eﬀects for nuclei with high Z numbers by including the kinetic-energy mass

correction term of the Breit-Pauli Hamltonian.

Eq. (B2) describes three coupled one dimension harmonic oscillators. To make the oscillator

We have applied Eq.(B4) to correct the energy we found for the 1s2 state from table I and

the 2s3p state from II. Shown in table VI is a comparison between the zeroth order and

ﬁrst 1/D correction for these states with respect to the more exact values. We have noticed

that it is possible to correct the energy with the 1/D expansion to ﬁrst order but only if the

zeroth order error is signiﬁcant. For states where the zeroth order gave very good accuracy

(ie ¡ 1%) we do not expect much improvement from the ﬁrst 1/D correction. It was noted

in reference [3] that 30 terms of the 1/D expansion leads to a 9 decimal place accuracy for

the ground state energy of helium. Thus, the ﬁrst order term should only correct the most

signiﬁcant ﬁgure.

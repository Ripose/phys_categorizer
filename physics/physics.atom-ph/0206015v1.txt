Abstract

A study of the ﬁrst excited states of beryllium atom starting from explicitly cor-
related wave functions is carried out. Several properties are obtained and discussed
focusing on the analysis of the Hund’s rules in terms of the single–particle and electron
pair intracule and extracule densities. A systematic study of the diﬀerences on the
electronic distributions of the singlet and triplet states is carried out. The trial wave
function used to describe the diﬀerent bound states consists of a generalized Jastrow-
type correlation factor times a conﬁguration interaction model wave function. This
model wave function has been ﬁxed by using a generalization of the optimized eﬀective
potential method to deal with multiconﬁguration wave functions. The optimization
of the wave function and the calculation of the diﬀerent quantities is carried out by
means of the Variational Monte Carlo method.

I. INTRODUCTION

Most of the studies on the excited states of the beryllium atom have been focused on the
attainment of the binding energy. They have been mainly carried out by using extensive
Conﬁguration Interaction type wave functions obtaining very accurate results [1]. Recently
very precise values for the energy and related properties such as the electron aﬃnity or mass
shifts have been calculated by making use of the Quantum Monte Carlo method [2] and
by using large expansions of exponentially correlated Gaussian functions [3]. However the
knowledge of other interesting properties of these states is much more scarce. For example,
one and two body electron densities, which provide valuable information on the structure and
dynamics of the system are not fully characterized. This is due to the technical diﬃculties
appearing in their calculation. These densities play an important role in the understanding
and in the interpretation of some interesting features of the electronic structure of atoms
such as the Coulomb hole and the Hund’s rule [4]–[7]. This rule states that if two states arise
from the same conﬁguration, the state having the higher spin will have the lower energy.
For those states with the same spin value, the most bound one is that with the higher value
of the orbital angular momentum. Contrary to qualitative arguments, the electron–electron
repulsion is higher for the triplet state, and is the deeper electron–nuclear attraction energy
value of the triplet state the responsible for the lower triplet energy. This has been shown for
some excited states of Helium–like systems by using Hylleraas type wave functions [8], for the
1P –3P terms arising from the 2s–2p conﬁguration in beryllium, by using both Hartree-Fock
and Conﬁguration Interaction wave functions [9]–[14], and also for some other atomic and
molecular systems within the Hartree–Fock framework [15, 16].

The aim of this work is to extend previous studies to the ﬁrst excited states of the beryl-
lium atom with symmetry 1S, 3S, 1P , 3P , 1D and 3D by using explicitly correlated wave
functions. Starting from those wave functions the energy and some diﬀerent one– and two–
body position and momentum properties as well as the single-particle density and both the
interelectronic (intracule) and the center of mass (extracule) two–body densities in posi-
tion space have been obtained. Explicitly correlated wave functions fulﬁll some analytically
known properties of the densities, as for example the correct short range behavior and cusp
conditions which become very important in describing correctly the Coulomb hole. These
distribution functions provide a picture of the spatial arrangement of the electrons and will
be analyzed in order to get insight on the correlation eﬀects and on the Hund’s rule.

The single–particle density is deﬁned as

The corresponding spherically averaged densities are labelled as ρ(r), h(r12) and d(R), re-
spectively, and represent the probability density functions for the electron–nucleus distance,
r, the interelectronic distance, r12, and the center of mass distance, R. The single–particle
density is normalized to the number of electrons, N, and both the intracule and the extrac-
ule densities to the number of electron pairs, N(N − 1)/2. The value of the intracule and
extracule densities at the origin give us the probability of two electrons to be at the same
position and at opposite positions with respect to the nucleus, respectively.

The wave functions used in this work include explicitly the electronic correlations by means
of a Jastrow-type factor. Nondynamic eﬀects are also taken into account by using a multi
conﬁguration model wave function where the most important substitutions are included.
This parameterization has shown to provide accurate results for the ground state of the
isoelectronic series of the beryllium atom [17]. The calculation of the diﬀerent expectation
values has been carried out by means of the Variational Monte Carlo method [18].

The structure of this work is as follows. In Sec. II the trial wave function is shown in detail.
The results are presented and discussed in Sec.
III. The conclusions of this work can be
found in Sec. IV. Atomic units are used throughout unless otherwise indicated.

II. WAVE FUNCTION

The correlated trial wave function, Ψ, used in this work is the product of a symmetric
correlation factor, F , which includes the dynamic correlation among the electrons, times a
model wave function, Φ, that provides the correct properties of the exact wave function such
as the spin and the angular momentum of the atom, and is antisymmetric in the electronic
coordinates.

Ψ = F Φ

(4)

For the correlation factor we use the form of Boys and Handy [19] with the prescription
proposed by Schmidt and Moskowitz [20]. In particular we have worked with 17 variational
non–linear parameters in the correlation factor which include electron–nucleus, electron–
electron and electron–electron–nucleus correlations.

In order to get the diﬀerent bound states of a given L, S symmetry we make use of the well
known Hylleraas-Undheim theorem. The hamiltonian is diagonalized in a set of m linear
independent trial functions with the proper symmetry and then the eigenvalues constitute
upper bounds to the ﬁrst m bound states. The trial wave functions are linear combinations
of Slater determinants built starting from the single particle conﬁgurations 1s2nln′l′, with
n, n′ = 2, 3 and l, l′ = s, p, d, coupled to the total orbital angular momentum and spin of the
term under study times the Jastrow correlation factor aforementioned. For the 1D state we
have also considered the conﬁguration 1s22s4d.

The model wave function has been ﬁxed within the optimized eﬀective potential framework.
This is a mean ﬁeld approximation to the many electron problem based on ﬁnding the best
local one-body potential minimizing the total energy, which is expressed as an orbital func-
tional as in the Hartree-Fock approach. This method was ﬁrst proposed by Slater [21] as
a simpliﬁcation of the Hartree-Fock equations and further developed and applied to atomic
problems by Talman and coworkers [22, 23]. The trial wave function is a Slater determi-
nant with single–particle wave functions calculated from a certain eﬀective potential that
is assumed to be central. The minimum condition on the eﬀective potential leads to a set
of non-linear coupled integro-diﬀerential equations involving the potential and the orbitals.
They can be solved by means of a self-consistent procedure just like in the Hartree-Fock
method by using either numerical-grid techniques [22, 23] or by expanding the eﬀective po-
tential in a ﬁnite basis set that guarantees the fulﬁllment of the correct asymptotic behavior
[24].

In this work we have generalized this method to deal with multi conﬁguration wave functions
instead a single Slater determinant

Xk
where φk are Slater determinants built with the eigenfunctions of the eﬀective potential,
which has been parameterized in the present work as follows

Φmc =

Ckφk

V (r) =

(Z − N + 1) + (N − 1)

1
r (

ake−bkr

)

Xk

where Z, N are the nuclear charge and the number of electrons, respectively, and {ak, bk} are
ak = 1 to match the exact short range behavior
variational parameters with the constraint
of the potential. It also reproduces the exact long range behavior.

P

Within this scheme, given some particular values of the parameters {ak, bk} the one-body
Schr¨odinger equation deﬁned by the eﬀective potential is solved. The orbitals obtained by
solving this single particle Schr¨odinger equation are used to write down the Slater determi-
nants appearing in the multi conﬁguration expansion of the trial wave function of Eq.(5).

Then the total energy is calculated as the expectation value of the hamiltonian in that trial
wave function. The linear coeﬃcients Ck of the conﬁguration interaction expansion of the
model wave function are also obtained in this step. The optimum set of parameters of the
eﬀective potential is ﬁxed by imposing the minimum condition on the total energy. Finally
it is worth to point out that the one-body problem has been solved here by expanding
the radial part of the single particle wave functions in terms of Slater functions as in the
Roothaan-Hartree-Fock method.

The purpose of the present work is not to obtain the best description of the excited states of
the beryllium atom within the eﬀective potential framework. It constitutes only a previous
step that produces the model wave functions used along with the correlation Jastrow factor.
Therefore full convergence in the number of free parameters of the eﬀective potential has
not been pursued. Instead a certain compromise between the number of free parameters and
the accuracy at the eﬀective potential framework has been found. For example when using
the single conﬁguration 1s22s2 to describe the ground state of the Be atom, the eﬀective
potential wave function used here provides an energy of −14.57235 au to be compared with
the optimized eﬀective potential results −14.57245 au and −14.57256 au reported in [23]
and [24] respectively and with the Hartree-Fock value −14.57302 au. In the case of a multi
conﬁguration wave function built from the linear combination of the conﬁgurations 1s22s2
and 1s22p2 that takes into account the near degeneracy eﬀect and constitutes the complete
active space wave function for this atom, the optimized eﬀective potential energy obtained
by us is −14.61556 au while the exact Multi Conﬁguration Hartree Fock (MCHF) value
with these two conﬁgurations is −14.61685 au [25]. For the sake of completeness we men-
tion here that the energy when a Jastrow correlation factor is used along with the eﬀective
potential model function obtained here is −14.6647(1) au that coincides with the value of
[26] where a MCHF was used as model function, to be compared with the estimated exact
energy −14.66736 au [25].

The way in which the diﬀerent calculations have been carried out is the following. For
any given a state, for example the 2s3s–1S, the set of conﬁgurations that are thought to
be the most important is selected, 1s22s2, 1s22p2, 1s22s3s and 1s22p3p in our example.
With them the model wave function, Φmc, is ﬁxed within the eﬀective potential framework.
The diagonalization gives rise to a set of orthogonal and non correlated vectors (four in
our example). A new correlated basis set is built up by multiplying each one of the non–
correlated vectors by the correlation factor, F , which depends on 17 variational non–linear
In this new basis set, which is non–orthogonal, we diagonalize the atomic
parameters.
hamiltonian, obtaining the eigenvectors along their corresponding eigenvalues, which are
upper bounds to the four ﬁrst states of 1S–type. Because we are interested in the excited
2s3s–1S state, we optimize the non–linear parameters of the correlation factor by minimizing
the second eigenvalue. The minimization has not been carried out on the variance but on
the energy, that has shown to provide not only more accurate upper bounds [27] but also

5

a better description of other properties [26]. The ﬁnal wave function, Ψcmc, is written as a
correlated basis function expansion, that in our example is

Ψcmc[2s3s;1 S] = F (d1φ[2s2;1 S] + d2φ[2p2;1 S] + d3φ[2s3s;1 S + d4φ[2p3p;1 S])
(7)
where the core 1s2 is implicit in each one of the conﬁgurations. The new coeﬃcients dk are
obtained in the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the correlated basis, and the diﬀerent
matrix elements of the hamiltonian in this basis set have been calculated by using the Monte
Carlo algorithm.

III. RESULTS

The use of a large number of conﬁgurations increases greatly the computer time and also
the numerical errors in the diagonalization. Therefore we have to limit ourselves to consider
a number of conﬁgurations as small as possible. Thus, for each one of the states studied, a
given conﬁguration has been selected if the diﬀerence between the energies obtained with and
without it is clearly greater than the statistical error in the calculation, once the correlation
factor has been included. In some cases these conﬁgurations do not coincide with those most
important if the correlation factor, F , is not considered. The best wave functions obtained
in this work recover more than 90% of the correlation energy. The correlation energy has
been traditionally deﬁned in quantum chemistry calculations as the diﬀerence between the
exact (non-relativistic, inﬁnite nuclear mass) and the Hartree-Fock energies. However for
some of the states studied in this work the Hartree–Fock method does not provide an upper
bound on the energy. This problem is handled here by deﬁning the correlation energy as the
diﬀerence between the exact non relativistic energy and that obtained with the best model
wave function Φmc.

We have studied the ﬁrst ten excited states of the beryllium atom, ﬁve singlets and ﬁve
triplets. The conﬁgurations used to study each one of the states considered are shown in
Table I. In general, conﬁguration mixing is much more important for singlet than for triplet
states. In this table we show the excitation energy, in eV , obtained for each one of the states
studied. The non–correlated energy obtained from Φmc by using these conﬁgurations as well
as the correlated energy obtained from Ψcmc are compared with the estimated exact one [28].
In parenthesis we show the statistical error in the Monte Carlo calculation and, in brackets,
the percentage of correlation energy recovered. For triplet states the diﬀerence between the
energy obtained in this work and the exact one oscillates around 0.07 eV , except for the
2s3p–3P for which is 0.1 eV . For singlet states this diﬀerence goes from 0.1 to 0.14 eV . The
greatest diﬀerence is 0.142 eV , i.e. 0.005 hartree, and corresponds to the state 2s3p–1P. In
general the contribution to a given singlet state from other conﬁgurations than the principal
one is much more important than for a triplet state. As a consequence, the energy obtained
for singlet states within a subspace given is, in general, of a poorer quality than for triplet
states.

In Tables II, III and IV we show the results obtained for the moments of the single–particle
and the electron pair intracule and extracule densities, respectively, starting from the cor-
related wave function Ψcmc. We give the expectation values htni, where t = r, r12 and R,
respectively, and n = −2, −1, 1, 2 and 3. We have also calculated the value of the single–
particle and of both, the intracule and the extracule, densities at the origin. In doing so the
following relation has been used

for the single–particle density (χ = ρ, t = r) [29] and for the intracule (χ = h, t = r12)
and the extracule (χ = d, t = R) densities [30]. These expressions allow one to obtain
a local property of the corresponding density in terms of the wave function evaluated in
the whole domain. In order to calculate all these expectation values we have used |Ψcmc|2
as distribution function, except for h(0) and hr−2
12 i for which we have used Q|Ψcmc|2, with
Q =

ij, which provides more accurate results for those expectation values.

To study the quality of the results in Tables II and III we compare the results obtained for
the ground state with those than can be considered as exact obtained also from an explicitly
correlated wave function [31], and with those obtained in [26] where a correlated wave func-
tion similar to Ψcmc but with a MCHF model wave function was used instead. The results
In Tables
obtained in this work are of a great quality, improving those reported in [26].
III–IV we also included the results recently obtained for the ground state intracule and ex-
tracule densities of beryllium starting from a MCHF wave function [32]. Despite these last
results are unaﬀected of statistical errors and are very precise in a numerical sense, they are
not as accurate as ours at low interelectronic distances which is the region where electronic
correlations are more important. That shows the validity of our techniques and our wave
function that, although approximated, accounts for the most relevant physical correlation

of both the intracule and extracule densities of the 2s2p–1P and 2s2p–3P states [14] and
some values obtained for the intracule density of those same states starting from a multi
conﬁgurational wave function [12].

To study the eﬀects of electronic correlations we have considered those states for which the
single conﬁguration Hartree-Fock method can be applied to obtain upper bounds to the
exact non–relativistic energy of the corresponding state. These states are 2s2p–3P, 2s2p–1P,
2s3s–3S , 2p2–1D, 2p2–3P, and 2s3d–3D, i.e. the most bounded state with a L, S given, except
the 2p2–3P state because at a Hartree Fock level this state is orthogonal to the 2s3p–3P one.
For all these states we have worked with a monoconﬁgurational wave function calculated
from the optimized eﬀective potential approach, that it is very similar to the Hartree-Fock
one. For some other states it is necessary to work with an interaction conﬁguration wave

7

function that includes partially correlation eﬀects.

The diﬀerences found between correlated and Hartree–Fock results are much more important
for singlet than for triplet states. To analyze systematically the diﬀerent correlation mecha-
nism included by the trial function we have calculated the following diﬀerence functions

fcmc−sc(t) = 4πt2[fcmc(t) − fsc(t)]
fmc−sc(t) = 4πt2[fmc(t) − fsc(t)]
fcmc−mc(t) = 4πt2[fcmc(t) − fmc(t)]

(9)
(10)
(11)

where f and t stand for R and r, H and r12, and D and R, respectively. The fcmc function
is the corresponding density calculated from the best correlated wave function obtained in
this work, Ψcmc, fmc correspond to a multiconﬁguration wave function without Jastrow cor-
relation factor, Φmc, and ﬁnally fsc is the density calculated from the single conﬁguration
self consistent approach wave function. The fcmc−sc(t) diﬀerence functions account for the
full eﬀect of the electronic correlations on the densities, the fmc−sc(t) give us insight on the
eﬀects of the conﬁguration mixing on the electronic distribution and ﬁnally fcmc−mc give us
information on the importance of the Jastrow factor.

In Figure 1 we show the results obtained for fmc−sc and fcmc−sc, for the 2s2p–1P and 2s2p–3P
states which are representative for those results obtained for singlet and triplet states. The
same is shown in Figure 2 for the fcmc−mc diﬀerence functions. Several are the eﬀects that
can be noticed:

i) The big magnitude of the several diﬀerence functions for singlet states as compared with
those for triplet ones show that the monoconﬁgurational self consistent wave function is not
adequate for describing singlet states and a multiconﬁgurational wave function is necessary
to include those aspects more relevant in the structure of these states.

ii) For singlet states, the medium and long range behavior of the three diﬀerence functions
is well described by the model wave function, Φmc. However short range correlations, which
are explicitly included in the correlation factor, F , are necessary to reproduce the Coulomb
hole in h(r12) as well as the short R behavior of the extracule density.

iii) For triplet states the conclusions are not clear: the diﬀerence functions fmc−sc are quite
ﬂat, except for the extracule function, although they follow the correct trend for large values
of the variable and then they include large range correlations. The functions fcmc−sc show
a great amount of structure for all the three densities. That indicates that for triplet states
the interaction conﬁguration wave function is not so important as in the case of singlet states.

8

iv) As can be seen in Figure 2, the eﬀect of the correlation factor on the three diﬀerence
functions is similar for triplet and singlet states for short and medium distances, indicating
that the correlation factor is nearly independent of the total spin of the system. The diﬀer-
ences between singlet and triplet become more important at larger distances.

v) The main eﬀects of the electronic correlations take place at low values of the interparticle
distance in the intracule density, the so called Coulomb hole. The structure of this Coulomb
hole is practically the same for all the states considered in this work.

A comparative study of the states arising from the same conﬁguration shows that singlet
states are more extended in space than triplet ones. This is due to the outermost electron,
as can be checked by comparing the moments of positive order of singlet and triplet states
in Tables II and III. This fact is particularly relevant for the 2s2p, 2s3d and 2s3s conﬁgu-
rations and specially important in the 2p2 conﬁguration. The 2s3p conﬁguration is the case
where this eﬀect is less important. We have veriﬁed that the Hartree-Fock approximation,
although gives a qualitatively correct picture of this, provides values that overestimate this
eﬀect. Because of this more diﬀuse character of the electron cloud of the singlet as compared
with the triplet one could think that both electron-electron and electron-nucleus interactions
are stronger in the latter. However this does not hold in general, especially for high lying
−1
conﬁgurations. For example the electron–electron repulsion energy, Vee = hr
12 i, is higher
for singlet than for triplet states in the conﬁgurations 2s3p and 2s3d. Besides, the electron–
nucleus attraction energy, Ven = −Zhr−1i is slightly higher for the singlet state than for the
triplet one in the conﬁguration 2s3p.

The Hund’s rule is satisﬁed for all the conﬁgurations studied in this work except for the 2p2
one. In order to shed light over this fact we have analyzed the balance between the nuclear
attraction Ven = −Zhr−1i and electron-electron repulsion Vee = hr−1
12 i energies. For the 2s2p
and 2s3s conﬁgurations the lower energy of the triplet is due to a tighter nuclear attraction
that compensates the electron-electron repulsion that is also stronger in the triplet. This
same interpretation has been given previously for other systems as helium-like ions [6] stud-
ied by means of correlated wave functions and some states of the atoms C, N, O, Si, S and
others [15] studied by using self consistent type wave functions. This is the opposite to the
traditional interpretation of the Hund’s rule based on the assumption that the repulsion is
smaller in the triplet state. We have found that the only conﬁguration for which this tradi-
tional interpretation holds is the 2s3p one, that presents a stronger repulsion in the singlet
that compensates the eﬀect of the nuclear attraction that is slightly bigger also for the singlet.
In the case of the 2s3d conﬁguration both the nuclear attraction and the electronic repulsion
tend to make the triplet more bounded than the singlet. Finally, the only conﬁguration that
does not verify the Hund’s rule is the 2p2 one. This is due to the stronger electronic repulsion
of the triplet that beats the bigger nuclear attraction of this state as compared to the singlet.

A comparative study of the singlet–triplet single–particle, intracule and extracule densities
can be seen in Figure 3 where we show the diﬀerence functions 4πt2[f1(t) − f3(t)] where t
stands for r, r12 and R, and f1 (f3) for the singlet (triplet) single–particle, intracule and ex-
tracule densities. In Figure 3 (top) we show the diﬀerences for the single–particle density. At
very short distances appreciable diﬀerences are observed only for the 2p2 and 2s3d conﬁgura-
tions. For the former the singlet density is clearly higher than the triplet one. For the 2s3d
conﬁguration the triplet shows slightly higher values than the singlet state. For the other
conﬁgurations the statistical errors associated to the Monte Carlo calculation do no allow
us to appreciate clearly the diﬀerences between singlet and triplet single–particle density for
short distances. The conﬁgurations with an electron in the M shell behave diﬀerently than
the 2s2p and 2p2 ones at low and medium distances, where the diﬀerence function show a
region where it is positive. That means that for those conﬁgurations the singlet states have
a higher density at both low and large electron–nucleus distances, whereas for the 2s2p and
2p2 the singlet density is clearly smaller than the triplet one at low and medium r–distances.
It is evident from this ﬁgure that the decrease in the value hr−1i for singlet states is a much
more complex electronic redistribution than the one observed for the 2s2p [12, 14].

At the middle of Figure 3 we plot the diﬀerence function for the intracule density. Again
the behavior of the 2s2p and 2p2 diﬀerence functions is very diﬀerent to the rest of the
cases studied. The ﬁrst two conﬁgurations show a deep minimum at short interelectronic
distances that indicates that, despite the Fermi hole, electrons are more likely to be at short
interelectronic distances in the triplet state than in the singlet one. However the situation
is diﬀerent in the other conﬁgurations where the electronic radial intracule density is higher
in singlet states for short and large interelectronic distances.

At this point it is important to note the diﬀerence in magnitude between the 2s2p and 2p2
conﬁgurations. The ﬁrst one shows a relatively deeper hole for the single–particle than for
the intracule density that allows one to explain the Hund’s rule as usual. However for the
2p2 conﬁguration the magnitude of the hole in the intracule density is much greater than
the corresponding one in the single particle density. This means that the electron–electron
repulsion energy is much smaller in the singlet than in the triplet state, leading to an inver-
sion in the order of the states.

The extracule density give us further insight into these facts. For the 2s2p conﬁguration,
the electrons in the triplet have a tendency to be at opposite positions with respect to the
nucleus to reduce the increased electron repulsion energy [14]. This eﬀect is much less pro-
nounced in the 2p2 conﬁguration as can be seen in Figure 3 (bottom), while for the rest of
the conﬁgurations the opposite holds.

The results obtained for the 2s2p conﬁguration show the same behavior as in the Hartree–
Fock framework [14], although the numerical values are diﬀerent. These two two–body

10

diﬀerence functions decrease from zero to a minimum value, then increase to a maximum
from where they tends to zero taking positive values. The three densities of the 2s3p con-
ﬁguration show a minimum at short distances, not very important in magnitude. This is
due to the diﬀerent behavior of singlet and triplet densities at their corresponding second
maximum, making this conﬁguration slightly diﬀerent from all the rest.

Finally, in all cases the diﬀerence functions approach to zero at large distances from positive
values, that indicates that singlet states are more extended in space than triplet ones.

To better understand these diﬀerences, we show in Figures 4, 5 and 6, the singlet and triplet
single–particle, intracule and extracule radial densities, respectively for each one of the con-
ﬁgurations studied here. In all cases the pictures show two or three maxima, corresponding
to the number of shells involved in each conﬁguration. The third maximum is more diﬃcult
to observe in the single–particle density, as it can be seen in Figure 3, but it is very important
in both the intracule and extracule densities. In all the cases considered the more impor-
tant diﬀerences are found for the second and third maxima due to the diﬀerent coupling
of the outermost electrons. For the 2s2p and 2p2 conﬁgurations, the second maximum of
the single particle density is higher for the triplet than for the singlet state. For the other
conﬁgurations the second maximum is practically the same for the singlet and the triplet
while the third maximum is again higher for the triplet than for the singlet. For both the
intracule and the extracule densities the behavior is similar as in the single–particle density
with some exceptions. For the 2s3s and 2s3d conﬁgurations in both the intracule and extrac-
ule densities the second maximum of the singlet is higher than its counterpart in the triplet
state. For the 2s3p states the second maximum of the extracule density is higher for the
singlet than for the triplet, while the contrary holds for the intracule density. The diﬀerences
for the single–particle density are less important than for the intracule or extracule densities.

In Table V we report some two body properties in position and momentum spaces.
particular we give the position expectation value h~r1 · ~r2i = h
correlation factor, τ , introduced by Kutzelnigg, Del Re, and Berthier [33], deﬁned as

This quantity is bounded in magnitude by unity, −1 ≤ τ ≤ 1. τ = 1 (τ = −1) means
perfect positive (negative) correlation and τ = 0 is for non–correlated variables. For atomic
systems this coeﬃcient is a measure of the averaged relative angle of the position vectors of
each pair of electrons, and it is related to quantities that may be obtained from experimen-
tal measurements, such as the diamagnetic susceptibility and the dipole oscillator strength
distribution. Similar deﬁnitions are done in momentum space.

11

In position space these results indicate that the states here considered present negative an-
gular correlation, except for the singlet from 2s2p and 2s3d. This is consistent with the
previous analysis carried out for the extracule density. In momentum space all the states
show positive angular correlation. We have checked that these values depend strongly of the
conﬁguration mixing chosen in such a way that a small diﬀerence in energy can lead to a
diﬀerence of about 5% for these coeﬃcients.

We also report in Table V some correlated momentum expectation values which are directly
obtained in the Monte Carlo calculation. In particular we show the expectation values hp2i,
hp2
12i, hP 2i and h~p1 · ~p2i These values are compared with those obtained from Φmc, i.e. with
those obtained from a multiconﬁguration non explicitly correlated wave function. As it is
known these two body expectation values as well as hp2i are not linearly independent, but
they satisfy some relations that, for four electron atoms, are written as [36]

3hp2i = hp2
12i + 2h~p1 · ~p2i
3hp2i = 4hP 2i − 2h~p1 · ~p2i

(13)

(14)

As can be noticed from Table V the eﬀects of electronic correlations are very important for
hp2i and henceforth for the kinetic energy. This can be analyzed in terms of the previous
equations. The value of h~p1 ·~p2i from a non correlated wave function is nearly zero, except for
the 2s2p–3P state and for the 2p2 terms, and becomes positive when correlations are taken
into account. Electronic correlations also increase hP 2i while reduce the value of hp2
12i. This
same trend was also found for the ground state of the isoelectronic series of the beryllium
atom [36]. Finally it is worth to stress that the inclusion of the Jastrow correlation factor
reveals to be very important in order to get a reliable description of these properties.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The ﬁrst excited states of the beryllium atom have been studied. We have considered the
singlet and triplet states of the conﬁgurations 2s2p (3P and 1P ), 2s3s (3S and 1S), 2p2
(1D and 3P ) 2s3p (3P and 1P ) and 2s3d (3D and 1D). We have analyzed the diﬀerences
between singlet and triplet states and the eﬀect of electronic correlations on them. This
study has been carried out not only for the energy of the state but also on some other
properties related to the electronic distribution. Explicitly correlated wave functions have
been used to describe these states. They include a Jastrow-type correlation factor and a
multiconﬁguration model wave function providing accurate values of the correlation energy.
The model wave function has been calculated by a generalization of the optimized eﬀective
potential method to include conﬁguration interaction type expansions. All the calculations
of this work have been performed by using the Variational Monte Carlo Method.

The eﬀects of electronic correlations are more important for singlet than for triplet states.

12

To describe the former it is absolutely necessary to consider a multi conﬁguration model
wave function for any of the states studied, while for the latter a single conﬁguration model
wave function provides practically the same results as those given by the multi conﬁguration
one. Both the correlation factor, F , and the Coulomb hole, show a similar structure for
singlet and triplet states. The eﬀects of electronic correlations are more important for the
intracule and extracule densities than for the single-particle density, as one could expect.

Singlet states present a more diﬀuse electronic distribution than triplet ones. This eﬀect is
overestimated in the Hartree-Fock approximation. This fact is deeply related to the rela-
tive binding energy of the singlet and triplet states because of its inﬂuence on the balance
between the nuclear attraction and electron-electron repulsion energies. For the 2s2p and
2s3s conﬁgurations we have found that the bigger magnitude of the nuclear attraction in the
triplet compensates the bigger value of the electronic repulsion of the triplet giving rise to a
lower value of the binding energy, according to the usual interpretation of Hund’s rule. This
is not the case of the 2s3p conﬁguration where the lower energy of the triplet state is due
to the bigger electronic repulsion in the singlet, where the nuclear attraction is also slightly
bigger in magnitude than in the triplet. For the 2s3d conﬁguration both the electron-nucleus
attraction and the electron-electron repulsion contribute in the same direction to make more
bound the triplet state. The 2p2 conﬁguration does not satisfy the Hund’s rule because here
the bigger magnitude of the nuclear attraction in the triplet does not compensate its bigger
value of the electronic repulsion.

The eﬀect of electronic correlations is also to decrease the expectation value h~r1 · ~r2i, i.e.
to increase the probability of two electrons to be at opposite positions with respect to the
nucleus, except for the singlet 2s2p and 2s3d.
In momentum space the situation is the
opposite, ﬁnding positive angular correlation. This is related to the increase of the kinetic
energy when correlations are taken into account (virial theorem) and the pair-center of mass
momentum distribution, while the relative momentum of two electrons becomes reduced.

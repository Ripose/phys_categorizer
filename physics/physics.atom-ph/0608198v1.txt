Resonant energy transfer between cold Rydberg atoms was used to determine Rydberg atom
energy levels, at precisions approaching those obtainable in microwave spectroscopy. Laser cooled
85Rb atoms from a magneto-optical trap were optically excited to 32d5/2 Rydberg states. The
two-atom process 32d5/2 + 32d5/2 → 34p3/2 + 30g is resonant at an electric ﬁeld of approximately
0.3 V/cm. This process is driven by the electric dipole-dipole interaction, which is allowed due to
the partial f character that the g state acquires in an electric ﬁeld. The experimentally observed
resonant ﬁeld, together with the Stark map calculation is used to make a determination of the 85Rb
ng-series quantum defect: δg(n = 30) = 0.00405(6).

I.

INTRODUCTION

Energy can be transferred more rapidly between two
atoms when the process is resonant: one atom gives its
energy to another, without a change in the kinetic energy
of either atom. Although resonant energy transfer often
relies on serendipity, the large Stark shifts of Rydberg
atoms may allow the resonant condition to be exactly
obtained by application of an electric ﬁeld [1]. The res-
onant energy transfer process between Rydberg atoms is
driven by the electric dipole-dipole interaction. Transi-
tion dipole moments between nearby Rydberg states can
be large, typically scaling as n2, where n is the princi-
pal quantum number [2]. As a consequence, resonant
energy transfer collision cross-sections scale as n4, and
are large compared to typical collision cross-sections for
less excited atoms – usually by many orders of magnitude
[1, 2].

Stoneman et al. [3] pointed out that the ﬁelds at which
resonant energy transfer occurs may – under certain con-
ditions – be used for precise Rydberg energy level spec-
troscopy. They examined the resonant energy transfer
process: 29s + 29d → 29p + 28p, in potassium. Since
the shifts of the Rydberg energy levels with ﬁeld are rel-
atively well-understood, they were able to use the reso-
nance ﬁelds to determine improved zero ﬁeld atomic en-
ergy levels. In particular, they determined a substantially
more precise value for the quantum defect of the np-series
of potassium.

The range of electric ﬁelds or “width” over which sig-
niﬁcant resonant energy transfer can be observed is im-
portant in this type of experiment, as it dictates the pre-
cision to which line centers can be determined. By reduc-
ing the spread in the velocity distribution of their sample
Stoneman et al. [3] were able to signiﬁcantly narrow the
width of their observed resonances.

With the development of laser cooling, Rydberg atom
samples with much narrower velocity distributions could
be studied [4, 5].
In general, the resulting narrowness
of the resonant energy transfer resonances has not been

exploited for spectroscopic purposes. Instead, work has
concentrated on the dynamical aspects of resonant en-
ergy transfer between cold Rydberg atoms. For example,
Carroll et al. [6] have recently studied how the relative
orientation of the electric ﬁeld with respect to the spatial
orientation of two Rydberg atoms inﬂuences their dipole-
dipole interaction. They used cold Rb atoms obtained
from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) to study the process:
32d + 32d → 34p + 30k, where 30k represents the Stark-
states centered around n = 30. The Stark states are
superpositions of high angular momentum states (ℓ & 4
in this case) exhibiting energy shifts which are linear in
the applied electric ﬁeld strength. Strong resonant en-
ergy transfer was observed between 1 to 6 V/cm, and was
fully explained by a Stark map calculation, which took
into account the energy shifts of the participating atoms.
However, a series of peaks at approximately 0.5 V/cm
were not reproduced in the calculations (these peaks were
not relevant to the main point of their paper).

In this paper we demonstrate that the resonances ob-

served at low ﬁeld are due to the process:

32d + 32d → 34p3/2 + 30g

(1)

which is an allowed electric dipole-dipole interaction, due
to the f character that the g state acquires in the elec-
tric ﬁeld. In the spirit of the work of Stoneman et al. [3]
we use the observed resonant ﬁelds together with a Stark
map calculation to determine the ng-series quantum de-
fect.

Han et al. [7] have reported a preliminary observation
of two-photon (n + 2)d − ng microwave transitions in
85Rb. However, we are unaware of any other work on
the ng Rydberg series of Rb.

II. EXPERIMENT

The essence of the experiment is to measure the elec-
tric ﬁelds required for eﬃcient resonant energy transfer

85Rb atoms. Some details of our
between cold 32d5/2
apparatus have been previously described [8]. A stan-
dard vapor cell MOT is used as the source of cold 85Rb
atoms. These atoms are excited to 32d5/2 Rydberg states
using a two-photon, two-color process with 480 nm light,
and the nearly resonant, red-detuned 780 nm light used
for cooling and trapping. The 480 nm light is obtained
by frequency doubling a 960 nm cw ring Ti:sapphire
laser, which is frequency stabilized using the technique
described in Ref. [9]. The experiment is done at a 10 Hz
repetition rate, with an acousto-optic modulator used to
produce pulses of light.

For energy level determination from resonant energy
transfer spectroscopy it is critical to zero out any stray
electric ﬁelds, and then be able to apply accurately
known electric ﬁelds. Two stainless steel electrode plates,
separated by 36 mm, are located to either side of the
trapped atoms. By varying the voltages on these plates
and the voltage of the Rb dispenser source with respect
to the grounded chamber, it is possible to compensate
the stray electric ﬁeld in all three directions. The single-
photon transition 48s1/2 − 48p1/2 in 85Rb is used for
this purpose. This general procedure has been described
by Osterwalder and Merkt [10]. Since the single pho-
ton transition is sensitive to magnetic ﬁelds, the inhomo-
geneous magnetic ﬁeld necessary for MOT operation is
shut-oﬀ prior to photoexcitation to Rydberg states. At
the time of the experiment the residual magnetic ﬁeld
inhomogeneity over the sample is less than 17 mG. The
details of this shutting oﬀ procedure are presented in
Ref. [8].

Once the stray electric ﬁeld is compensated, the plate
voltages may be used to produce deliberate ﬁelds. We
calibrate these ﬁelds by observing the shifted frequencies
of the 48s1/2 − 48p1/2 transition and comparing them to
the frequencies expected from a Stark map calculation
[11]. The Stark map calculation uses the most recent
quantum defect data for 85Rb [7, 12]. Although quantum
defects for ℓ > 3 are not known, these do not signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence the calculated transition frequencies.

To observe resonant energy transfer between Rydberg
atoms with known electric ﬁelds, we produce the ﬁelds
in exactly the same way as during calibration using the
48s1/2 − 48p1/2 transition. The inhomogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld is also shut-oﬀ in an identical manner. After a
light excitation pulse of 1 µs duration, the electric ﬁeld
is ramped from zero to the desired value in 160 ns. The
atoms may interact during a waiting period of 21 µs.

Final Rydberg state populations after the waiting pe-
riod are analyzed by selective ﬁeld ionization (SFI) [2].
In this case SFI is only able to distinguish states diﬀering
by energies equivalent to a change of approximately one
principal quantum number. The 34p Rydberg states are
ionized at a lower ﬁeld than both the 32d5/2 initial states
and 30g, k ﬁnal states. By changing the applied electric
ﬁeld and recording the 34p population, resonant energy
transfer spectra may be obtained (see Fig. 1c). For com-
parison we have also recorded analogous spectra at one

2

lower n (Fig. 1a) and one higher n (Fig. 1e).

III. ANALYSIS

The striking diﬀerence in the three spectra presented
in Fig. 1 is the presence of the low-ﬁeld resonances in the
32d5/2 case, but not in the others. Carroll et al. have also
observed similar resonances in 32d (Ref. [6]), but not for
31d (Ref. [13]). Energetics [7, 12] rule out the process:
32d5/2 + 32d5/2 → 34p3/2 + 30f as a possible explanation
for these low-ﬁeld resonances. The ﬁnal state 34p3/2+30f
is at an energy less than the initial state in zero electric
ﬁeld, and this diﬀerence increases with increasing ﬁeld,
due to the f state polarizability.

There are no processes involving the well-characterized
low-angular momentum Rydberg states (ℓ ≤ 3) of Rb
which would account for the low ﬁeld resonances in
Fig. 1c. We need to consider higher angular momen-
tum states. The non-penetrating high angular momen-
tum states of Rydberg atoms have quantum defects which
scale like 1/ℓ5 (see, for example, Ref. [2]). Thus a rough
estimate of the ng-series quantum defect may be obtained
from the nf -series quantum defect [7]: δg ≈ δf (3/4)5 ≈
0.004. A preliminary calculation with this estimated
quantum defect shows that a resonance will occur for
the process: 32d5/2(mj = 1/2) + 32d5/2(mj = 1/2) →
34p3/2(mj = 1/2) + 30g7/2(mj = 1/2) at an electric ﬁeld
of 0.31 V/cm. This is very close to the lowest ﬁeld reso-
nance observed in Fig. 1c. However for the 31d5/2 case,
the energy of the two-atom state 33p3/2 + 29g is less than
the initial state 31d5/2 + 31d5/2, and this diﬀerence in-
creases with increasing ﬁeld (see Fig. 1b). This is consis-
tent with the lack of observed low-ﬁeld resonances in the
31d5/2 spectrum (Fig. 1a).

In the case of the 33d5/2, the electric ﬁeld does shift
35p3/2 + 31g closer in energy to 33d5/2 + 33d5/2. How-
ever, the 31g state reaches the n = 31 Stark manifold at
approximately the same ﬁeld (Fig. 1f). This is consistent
with the experimental observations in Fig. 1e.

The calculations in Fig. 1 consider only mj = 1/2 mag-
netic sublevels. However, electric ﬁelds break the mag-
netic sublevel energy degeneracy; therefore, there should
be diﬀerent resonance ﬁelds corresponding to the diﬀer-
ent possible magnetic sublevels for the states in Eq. 1.
The largest splittings are due to the magnetic sublevels of
30g. The four resonances observed at low ﬁelds in Fig. 1c
correspond to mj = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, and 7/2. The splittings
due to the magnetic sublevels of the other states are much
less than the widths of each of these four peaks.

All four observable resonances should be explainable
by the same ng-series quantum defect (δg). Figure 2a
illustrates calculated resonance ﬁelds as a function of a
variable δg, centered around the estimated δg ≈ 0.004
(see above). As illustrated in Fig. 2, all four resonances
are consistent with the same quantum defect, to better
than the widths of the resonances. We consider this as
strong evidence that the process in Eq. 1 is the explana-

tion for the low ﬁeld resonances.

As Fig. 2 suggests, we can extract an estimate of the
quantum defect from each one of these four resonances.
The uncertainty may also be estimated for each of these
experimentally determined quantum defects from the
derivatives ∂δg/∂F evaluated at the estimated quantum
defects (where F is the electric ﬁeld strength). The elec-
tric ﬁeld zeroing and calibration procedure is estimated
to have a 1σ uncertainty of less than 30 mV/cm at the
resonance ﬁelds. From the four resonances we determine
δg(n = 30) = 0.00405(6), which is consistent with a pre-
liminary report of δg = 0.00400(9) from Han et al. [7].

As demonstrated, energetics strongly support Eq. 1 as
the explanation for the low-ﬁeld resonances. However,
what drives this process? Resonant energy transfer be-
tween Rydberg atoms is typically a dipole-dipole inter-
action, with the coupling between the two-atom states
given by:

ˆVdd =

~µA · ~µB − 3(~µA · ~n)(~µB · ~n)
R3

AB

(2)

where RAB is the separation of the two atoms, ~n is a unit
vector pointing between them, and ~µA and ~µB are transi-
tion dipole moments evaluated on each of the individual
atoms (A and B). In zero electric ﬁeld the process given
in Eq. 1 cannot be driven by the dipole-dipole interac-
tion, since (cid:10)32d5/2|~µ|30g7/2(cid:11) = 0, given the ∆ℓ = ±1
selection rule for transition dipole moments. However,

the dominant character of a state until it reaches the
Stark manfold.
In particular, the mixing of 30g with
30f gives (cid:10)32d5/2mj=1/2|µz|30g7/2mj=1/2(cid:11) = 17 qea0

4

at 0.3 V/cm, where qea0 is the atomic unit of electric
dipole moment. The 32d5/2 to 34p3/2 coupling is al-
lowed in zero ﬁeld, and is much stronger. For example at
0.3 V/cm, (cid:10)32d5/2mj=1/2|µz|34p3/2mj=1/2(cid:11) = 357 qea0
(which diﬀers little from its zero ﬁeld value).

It is interesting to compare the expected signal
strengths for the resonance in Eq. 1 with other res-
onances that have been studied in similar experimen-
tal set-ups. For example, if we compare our transition
dipole moments to those for the 85Rb, 33s1/2 + 25s1/2 →
24p1/2 + 34p3/2 process observed in Ref. [4], we would
expect to have to wait approximately 10 times longer to
see the equivalent amount of collision signal (at the same
density). Since typical waiting times are 3 µs in Ref. [4]
vs. 21 µs in our case, this is consistent.

In the quasi-static picture [4] the collision signal is ex-
pected to scale with the square of the density for a dipole-
dipole interaction, and to a higher power for higher-order
multipole processes (for small collision signals). Exper-
imentally, we observe square law behavior. It does not
appear necessary to consider higher-order multipole in-
teractions (see, for example, Ref. [2]).

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Resonant energy transfer

spectroscopy has been
demonstrated as a useful tool for the determination of

unknown energy levels diﬀerences.
In particular, prior
to the work of Han et al. [7], no spectroscopy of the Rb
ng-series had been performed.

Although resonant energy transfer spectroscopy is not
a general technique for the determination of energy levels,
there may be more possibilities for the observation of res-
onances than previously thought. In particular, at ﬁrst
glance the resonance studied in this paper (Eq. 1) does
not appear to be allowed by the dipole-dipole interac-
tion. However, the mixing of the g-state with the nearby
f -state allows this process to be observed. It is expected
that similar scenarios exist in Rb and other atoms.

Microwave transitions have been used to calibrate the
applied electric ﬁelds in this work. However, there is a
great deal of ﬂexiblity in the particular transition (and
corresponding microwave frequency) that can be used for
this calibration. A precise microwave source is not re-
quired for the actual spectroscopic measurement. This
may be considered to be a signiﬁcant advantage.

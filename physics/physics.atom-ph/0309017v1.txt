Abstract

Using the z-scan technique, we have measured the self-induced absorptive and refractive nonlinear be-

havior of hot atomic rubidium vapor within the Doppler proﬁle of the D2 line. We observe large nonlinear

amplitude and phase effects with only tens of microwatts of incident power. Our results are in good agree-

ment with numerical calculations based on an analytic model of a Doppler- broadened two-level system.

Atomic vapors are interesting nonlinear optical materials because their nonlinear coefﬁcients

depend strongly on detuning, and nonlinear effects can be observed with very low cw laser power.

Nonlinear optics experiments in atomic vapors have included self-focusing, self-defocusing, self-

trapping and self- bending [1, 2, 3, 4]; third-harmonic generation [5]; and four-wave mixing [6].

Several measurements of Kerr nonlinear coefﬁcients have been reported in atomic vapors, for large

detunings [7], and some recent attention has focused on employing quantum coherence to control

atomic nonlinear properties [8].

There has also been recent discussion concerning the role of the nonlinearity of atomic rubid-

ium vapor in light-by-light guiding [9]. Theoretical work using three-level [10] and ﬁve-level [11]

models has been reported, both of which incorporate Doppler broadening numerically. The latter

of these papers argues that the ﬁve-level model is necessary to accurately predict the self-action of

a pump beam propagating in Rb vapor, and presents theoretical results on the index of refraction

variation due to self-action.

In this work, we report a measurement of self-induced nonlinear absorption and refraction in

hot atomic Rb vapor, within the Doppler proﬁle of the D2 line (λ = 780 nm). The nonlinearity

is due to saturated atomic absorption, and only tens of microwatts are needed to get into the

saturation regime for detunings within the Doppler proﬁle. Inhomogenous Doppler broadening

complicates the form of the nonlinearity and a Kerr model is insufﬁcient to describe it. A fully

analytic solution exists for the nonlinear behavior of a Doppler-broadened, two-level system, and it

is reasonably tractable in the limit of small power-broadened linewidth compared with the Doppler

width [12]. Using this model we successfully predict the beam propagation and self-action effects

in our experiment. While a slight variant of this model has frequently been discussed in relation

to nonlinear absorption in inhomogeneously broadened two-level systems, its application to self-

action refractive effects has been much rarer [13].

Our experimental setup is a standard z-scan conﬁguration [14] (see Fig. 1). The primary beam

is provided by a 10 mW tunable cw diode laser with a bandwidth δν

300 kHz. We measure its

symmetric, nearly-Gaussian shape by coupling it through a single-mode ﬁber with about 30%
efﬁciency. The beam is focused by a lens to a Rayleigh range zR ≈

We place a thin (L = 1 mm

stepper motor. To measure the noise in our system, we detune far off-resonance and record the

there should be no refractive effects, and these scans display the qualitative behavior expected

from a negative absorptive nonlinearity (i.e. absorption saturation). With the aperture closed, the

nonlinear phase imprinted by the atoms on the beam will change the far-ﬁeld beam width and be

detected as an asymmetric transmission proﬁle with z, as we observe. The symmetry of these

scans is that of a self-focusing (-defocusing) nonlinearity for blue (red) detuning, as expected.

To quantitatively ﬁt the scans, we model the Rb vapor as an inhomogenously (Doppler) broad-

ened two-level system [12]. The general expressions for the absorptive and refractive coefﬁcients

involve complex error functions, but can be considerably simpliﬁed when the power-broadening

of the homogenous linewidth is small compared to the Doppler width. In this limit the absorption

coefﬁcient and index of refraction are given by

In the limit of low intensity, Eqs. 1 and 2 become a Kerr (third-order) nonlinearity.

In a true Doppler-broadened two-level system, α0 and Is depend only on the homogeneous

linewidth, resonance frequency, atomic density and dipole moment. Because of the hyperﬁne
structure and the two isotopes 85Rb and 87Rb, our system is not truly two-level, so we allow α0

and Is to be parameters in our ﬁt. Our ﬁtting procedure performs a numerical integration of the

beam through the cell at each radial point, using Eqs. 1 and 2. The output beam is then propagated

to the far-ﬁeld detector using a quasi-fast Hankel transform [16]. We use enough radial points so

that, with absorption and refraction turned off, our model gives unity transmission to better than

0.05%. To estimate the numerical error in our integration, we perform the ﬁts twice, doubling

the number of integration steps in the second instance. The two ﬁtting results differ by less than

2%. It is worth noting that although our cell is “thin” in the sense that it is much shorter than the

beam Rayleigh range, it is not thin compared to the atomic absorption length. This requires us to

perform a full integration through the vapor, rather than simply imposing a single absorption and

phase proﬁle on the beam as it passes through the cell.

Our numerical ﬁts give excellent agreement with the open-scan data, with parameters Is =
2.1 mW/cm2 for both red and blue detuning, and α0 = 9.4 cm−1, 9.9 cm−1 for red and blue

detuning, respectively (see Fig. 2). To model the closed-aperture scans, we use these parameters

to calculate the transmission vs. z curves that should result for a 20% ﬂuence aperture, ﬁnding

good agreement within the systematic error (see Figs. 3, 4). The error is mostly from residual

beam astigmatism and uncertainties about the aperture size. We emphasize that we do not ﬁt or

adjust any parameters to produce the theory curves for the closed-aperture scans. The agreement

of the theory with the closed-aperture data is evidence of the Kramers-Kronig relations connecting

380 MHz, v is the most

probable atomic velocity) is 0.4 for the axial center of the beam at z = 0, falling off quadratically

in z and exponentially in the beam radius. Thus for calculations of the integrated transmission,

Eqs. 1 and 2 are good approximations.

To determine the effect of the unshielded geomagnetic ﬁeld we repeated the experiment with

vertical linear polarization, ﬁnding scans that differ by about 10%. Our ﬁts produced values of α0

that were the same as for horizontal polarization to within 5%, but the Is ﬁts were consistently a

factor of 2 larger. We attribute this to optical pumping effects, which can change the saturation

intensity seen by the beam by changing the population of atoms in dark states. With these altered

parameters, the ﬁt of the model to the data is excellent, indicating that a detailed inclusion of

optical pumping in the model is not needed.

The success of this analytic, Doppler-broadened, two-level model in describing self-induced

absorptive and refractive effects suggests that more complicated models are not needed to under-

stand self-action in atomic vapor. However, it is clear that this simple model fails to predict other

important nonlinear effects such as cross-saturation and cross-phase modulation. Their correct

treatment requires more complicated models that include the effects of more atomic levels.

In conclusion, we have used both open and closed z-scans with powers of only tens of mi-

crowatts to measure the absorptive and refractive nonlinearities of Rb vapor within the Doppler

proﬁle of the D2 line. Our open-aperture data are in excellent quantitative agreement with an ana-

lytic, Doppler-broadened two-level model. Parameters from the open-aperture ﬁts produce theory

curves for the closed-aperture data that ﬁt well to within the systematic error. Our results imply

that an analytic two-level model of the nonlinearity of Rb vapor is sufﬁcient for describing self-

action effects, as long as the powers involved do not broaden the homogeneous linewidth to larger

than the Doppler width.

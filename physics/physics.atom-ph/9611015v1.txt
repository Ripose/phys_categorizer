We experimentally study the motion of atoms interacting with
a periodically pulsed near resonant standing wave. For dis-
crete pulse frequencies we observe a comb-like momentum dis-
tribution. The peaks have widths of ≈ 0.3 ¯hk and a spacing
which is an integer multiple of the recoil momentum ¯hk. The
atomic population is trapped in ground states which period-
ically evolve to dark states each time the standing wave is
switched on.

Ultra cold atoms form an ideal system to study the evo-
lution of matter waves. The cold atoms have a large
spatial coherence and can be manipulated by atom-light
interaction. Using laser light, motional quantum states
of atoms can be precisely prepared and observed. Very
recently, Bloch oscillations [1] and the Wannier-Stark
ladder [2] have been demonstrated in fascinating exper-
iments, where laser cooled atoms interacted with an ac-
celerating standing wave potential. A similar system has
been used to study the relation between quantum evo-
lution and the underlying classical dynamics [3]. These
experiments were performed in a regime where dissipa-
tion due to spontaneous emission was negligible.

In this work we study the evolution of atomic mat-
ter waves interacting with a periodically pulsed standing
wave in the presence of dissipation. We prepare atoms via
spontaneous emission in non-stationary quantum states,
which are superpositions of diﬀerent momentum eigen-
states. We monitor their evolution and observe revivals
of states which are decoupled from the light ﬁeld by vary-
ing the time between successive pulses. The periodic in-
teraction with the standing wave leads to an accumu-
lation of the atoms in a comb-like momentum distribu-
tion with peaks narrower than the recoil momentum of
a single photon. Our scheme can thus be regarded as a
new approach to sub-recoil cooling. In velocity selective
coherent population trapping (VSCPT) [4] and Raman
cooling [5] the velocity selection is achieved during the
interaction with either a continuous light ﬁeld or with
a velocity-selective Raman pulse. For both techniques a
long interaction time with the light ﬁeld results in narrow
momentum distributions. In our scheme the kinetic evo-
lution of the atoms between two successive pulses leads
to the selection of sharply deﬁned velocity classes. This
is similar to Ramsey spectroscopy [6], where the energy

diﬀerence between atomic states is determined using two
or more separated interaction regions instead of a single
large one.

To understand the interaction of the atoms with the
pulsed standing wave let us recall the concept of dark
states. Consider an atomic transition which has an inte-
ger total angular momentum F both in the ground and
excited state manifolds. If this transition is driven with
polarized light, there is one ground state of the 2F + 1
ground states which is not coupled to the excited state
manifold [7]. This state is called a dark state and it can
be populated by optical pumping.

If the atom interacts with a continuous one dimen-
sional standing wave ﬁeld with a polarization gradient a
slightly more complex situation arises. We then have to
include the motion of the atom along the standing wave
axis. For the special case of an atom with a F = 1
1
transition there is a dark state which is also an eigen-
state of the kinetic energy [8]. This stationary dark state
facilitates VSCPT cooling. For atoms with larger angu-
lar momenta stationary dark states are not found in the
considered light ﬁeld, i. e. there are no dark states which
are also eigenstates of the kinetic energy. Consequently
the atom cannot remain decoupled from the light ﬁeld
[9].

→

In the case of the periodically pulsed standing wave
the atom kinetically evolves in the time between succes-
sive pulses. The kinetic evolution can lead to a revival of
the dark state [10,11], where the revival time depends on
the atomic velocities along the standing wave axis. This
revival of the dark state can be periodic. An atom can
therefore propagate through the pulsed standing wave
without being excited if it is in a state that evolves to
a dark state each time the standing wave is switched
on. These states are superpositions of states with diﬀer-
ent momenta and will be referred to as propagating dark
states. They exist only for discrete pulse frequencies (for
F > 1) and have discrete momenta. The propagating
dark states are populated by optical pumping and we ex-
pect the atomic population to accumulate in these states
after a suﬃciently long sequence of pulses. The atomic
momentum distribution will then show the momenta of
propagating dark states, which results in a comb-like dis-
tribution.

To be more speciﬁc consider a F = 2

interacting with a periodically pulsed standing wave. The

total Hamiltonian of this system is given by

H = P 2/(2M ) + HA + η(t)V,

where P is the atomic momentum operator, M the
atomic mass and HA the Hamiltonian of the internal
atomic states. The function η(t) is plotted in the lower
part of Fig. 1 and describes the time dependence of the
atom-light interaction V . It is periodically switched on
for time intervals of the length τ separated by longer in-
tervals of the length T . The standing wave consists of two
counter propagating waves with circular polarizations in-
ducing σ+ and σ− transitions. The atom-light interac-
tion can be written as a sum over diﬀerent momentum
families [12]:

within a momentum family. It consists of a W-type and
a M-type coupling scheme, as illustrated in the upper
part of Fig. 1. We will neglect the W-type system (thin
lines) since it does not contribute to the dark state and is
depopulated by optical pumping. The M-type coupling
scheme (bold lines) is given by

It is a superposition of three states with diﬀerent mo-
menta and diﬀerent magnetic quantum numbers, which
belong to the same momentum family p. If the phases
φp,0 and φp,±2 have the same value (modulo 2π), the
state ψp is a dark state and does not couple to the light
ﬁeld, i. e. V
= 0. It is not an eigenstate of the ki-
netic energy and therefore not a stationary dark state.
The free kinetic evolution of ψp can be described by the
time dependent phases φp,0(t) and φp,±2(t) which evolve
according to the kinetic energy of the corresponding mo-
mentum states. These phases are given by φp,0(t) =

where ωr = ¯hk2/(2M ) is the recoil frequency. Here we
assume that the state ψp(t) is in a dark state at t=0
with φp,0(t=0) = φp,±2(t=0) = 0. After a revival time

conditions are satisﬁed for times Tn = nτr/8 (where
τr = 2π/ωr is the recoil time), if ψp belongs to a mo-
mentum family with p = p(n)
n 2¯hk + ¯hk. The kinetic
evolution of a state ψp (with p = p(n)
m ) is periodic and it is
a dark state at times t = 0, Tn, 2Tn, 3Tn, . . .. If the stand-
ing wave is switched on only at these times (i. e. when
ψp is a dark state), ψp is a propagating dark state and
its interaction with the standing wave ﬁeld vanishes. For
n = 1 the propagating dark states have momenta which
are odd integer multiples of ¯hk. For n = 2 the propagat-
ing dark states have momenta which are even and odd
integer multiples of ¯hk [13]. For n > 2 propagating dark
states can also have momenta which are integer fractions
of ¯hk [14].

The lifetime of a propagating dark state in the period-
ically pulsed standing wave is limited by the intervals τ
during which the standing wave is switched on. During
this time the kinetic Hamiltonian leads to an eﬀective
coupling of the dark state to the light ﬁeld [12,9]. This
results in a lifetime 1/Γ′′ of the dark state which is pro-
portional to |Ω|2
Γ )−1 (where Γ−1 is the excited
state life time and ∆ the detuning between laser and
atomic transition frequency). To minimize the excita-
tion of a propagating dark state it is necessary to choose
1/Γ′′. A high Rabi coupling eﬀectively hinders the
τ
evolution of the propagating dark state [15]. We therefore
expect the longest lifetime for propagating dark states
when the time between successive standing wave pulses
is T = Tn (rather then τ + T = Tn). This corresponds
to the assumption that we can neglect the evolution of
the propagating dark state while the standing wave is
switched on.

≪

Atoms which are not in propagating dark states are
excited by the pulsed standing wave. Each spontaneous
emission of a photon changes the momentum of the atom,
and the atom can decay to a propagating dark state.
There it experiences a strongly reduced excitation rate.
We therefore expect that atoms accumulate in propagat-
ing dark states during the interaction with the pulsed
standing wave. The momentum distribution will then
show peaks at the momenta of propagating dark states.
The width of the peaks can become narrower than the
single photon recoil. This velocity selectivity is due to
the kinetic evolution of atoms between two pulses. Con-

During the free kinetic evolution the state ψp′ will in-

again after a time T = Tn, the state ψp′ has not com-
pletely evolved to a dark state. This increases the prob-
ability that ψp′ is excited by the standing wave and it
reduces the atomic population in the momentum family
p′.

states, we have performed an experiment with 87Rb

trapped atoms is accelerated downwards using optical
molasses cooling to a moving reference frame. After
17 cm of ﬂight the cloud arrives with a speed of 3.2 m/s

and a density of n

ﬁelds to below 0.5 mG. On their ballistic trajectory down-
wards the atoms interact with a horizontally aligned

sponding to n = 1). During the interaction time of 1.1 ms

above the sheet of light optically pumps the atoms from
the F = 1 to the F = 2 ground state manifold and can
be used to additionally detect atoms in the F = 1 ground
state. We have used this beam to verify that no atoms
leave the interaction region in the F = 1 ground state
manifold. The overall momentum resolution of the de-
tection system has been improved to σ = 0.3 ¯hk (where
σ is the e−1/2 half width), as compared to previous ex-
periments done with the same apparatus [16]. The mea-
surements presented here are integrated over 200 atom
clouds extracted from the magneto-optical trap at a rate
of 1 s−1. The stray light background has been measured
in an identical repetition of the experiment but without
atoms and has been subtracted from the data. To yield
one dimensional momentum distributions we have inte-
grated the two dimensional images along the direction
perpendicular to the cooling axis.

In Fig. 3(a) the momentum distribution measured for
a pulse spacing T = 35µs is shown. The comb-like
structure with 2¯hk spacing between the sub-recoil cold
peaks stems from atoms trapped in propagating dark
states. The peaks occur at odd multiples of ¯hk, as we
expect for n=1 (T = 1τr/8 = 35 µs). Each propagat-
ing dark state contributes to three neighboring peaks.
The width of these peaks is determined by a best Gaus-
sian ﬁt as σ = 0.3 ¯hk. The envelope of the momentum
distribution has a width of σ
4.4 ¯hk. It results from
broadening of the initial distribution, which has for ge-
ometrical reasons a width of σ = 1.7 ¯hk (measured with
all ﬁelds permanently switched oﬀ in the interaction re-
gion). We experimentally varied the length τ of the
light pulses. For pulses up to a factor of two longer the
observed momentum distribution did not change signif-
icantly, whereas shorter pulses lead to a reduced con-
trast in the momentum spectrum. This is in agree-
ment with the calculated τ Γ′ = 0.8 excitation cycles
per light interval. Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 3(d) show the mo-
mentum distributions for pulse spacings T = 30 µs and
T = 40 µs. The sharp peaks smear out since in both cases
the pulse spacing deviates from the resonance condition
T = 35 µs. Propagating dark states which are completely
decoupled from the standing wave do not exist for these
pulse spacings. A further increase of the pulse spacing to
T = 60 µs completely washes out the comb-like structure.
For T = 2τr/8 = 70 µs [see Fig. 3(c)] a momentum comb
appears again with a spacing of ¯hk, as expected for the
n = 2 resonance.

Our scheme can be extended to two and three dimen-
F and
sions and to transition schemes of the type F
F
1 (for F > 1). For Λ-type coupling schemes
the non-coupling state is a superposition of two momen-
tum states, so that for any time between successive pulses
a propagating dark state exists. As a cooling technique
our scheme might ﬁnd particular interest for atoms which
have transition frequencies that can only be excited us-
ing pulsed laser-sources, e.g. the Lyman-α transition of

hydrogen. As our scheme provides continuous cooling it
can be applied to atomic beams so that another tempt-
ing application appears in atom lithography. There the
width of the fabricated nanostructures is mainly limited
by the transversal momentum distribution of the atomic
beam.

In conclusion, we have experimentally shown that
propagating dark states can be populated if the standing
wave is pulsed with a frequency of 1τr/8 or 2τr/8. For
larger time intervals (nτr/8, n
3) between the pulses
we expect the atoms to accumulate in momentum states
which are spaced by fractional multiples of ¯hk.

Ref. [10]. Their simulation of the F = 2 system corre-
sponds to the special case of n = 4 and m = −2.

[14] For comparison with optical near ﬁeld diﬀraction theory
the condition Tn = nτr/8 can be written in terms of a
length Ln = Tn|~p|/M = n(λ/2)2/λDB, where λ = 2π/k
is the laser wave length and λDB = 2π¯h/|~p| the DeBroglie

wave length of the atoms. These lengths Ln correspond
to the self imaging planes of a diﬀraction grating with
period λ/2 for scalar waves of the DeBroglie wave length.

where a high Rabi coupling leads to a reduced velocity

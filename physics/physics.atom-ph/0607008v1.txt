Abstract

We present an analysis of the three species or degeneracy three Fermi ﬂuid. Strongly interacting

three component Fermi ﬂuid could be realized experimentally with the spin polarized states of

6Li and broad and close lying Feshbach resonances. At high enough trapping ﬁeld, the electron

spin is polarized and the internal degrees of freedom are given by the nuclear spin projection.

For 6Li the nuclear angular momentum I = 1 can support three Zeeman states such that s-wave

interaction becomes possible for atoms occupying diﬀerent states. We estimate the threshold

of the three body binding using numerical and dimensional arguments. This threshold s-wave

scattering length depends on the range, unlike the two body case. We ﬁnd that the pseudo-

potential approximation does not provide accurate description of the degeneracy three Fermi ﬂuid.

We also explore superﬂuidity through broken symmetry pairing between two of the fermion species.

INTRODUCTION

A pair of identical fermions can interact by s-wave scattering when they occupy two

diﬀerent states. Fermi atoms can be loaded into diﬀerent internal spin projection states to

produce interacting Fermi gas at T ≈ 0.

For a Fermi gas at low density, an expansion of the ground state energy in terms of akF

is known (Lenz [1], Huang [2], and Galitskii [3]). Let us suppose that the Fermi gas is

composed of identical fermions occupying s diﬀerent spin states and assume that the partial

densities are the same. We call it the degeneracy s Fermi gas and we have the expansion

Fermi gas is uniquely determined by the parameter akF alone and Eq 1 would correspond

to the hypothetical normal state (the real gas is in the superﬂuid phase for any akF < 0).

However as we will see in later sections, generalization of this expression to s ≥ 3 becomes

troublesome as another dimensionless parameter RkF is required to describe the state of the

system.

On the other hand, for the neutron-neutron strong force interactions a ∼ −18.8f m and

R ∼ 1f m. In these cases, the system is in the intermediate regime of interaction. When

a → ±∞, two body bound pair is possible. However, the many body energy is positive

2

(E0/N ≈ 0.44EF G) [4] and the system is stable. Ground state results were reported [4, 5]

using the Quantum Monte Carlo calculations for this and other regimes of interaction.

In this work, the degeneracy three Fermi ﬂuid results are presented. Experiments using

cold alkali gases are suggested. The alkali atoms have one electron in the outer most shell.

The spin angular momentum of that electron is polarized when strong external magnetic

ﬁeld is applied and the internal degrees of freedom are determined by the nuclear angular

momentum. In case of 6Li, the total nuclear angular momentum I = 1 gives three diﬀerent

projections. Broad and close lying Feshbach resonances make the strong and attractive

interactions among the atoms in diﬀerent internal states possible [6]. This possibility was

explored theoretically by Modawi and Leggett [7]. Through radio-frequency techniques, the

molecule 6Li2 can be made from 6Li atoms occupying diﬀerent combination of internal states.

Given an external magnetic ﬁeld, the lithium pair interact with strength that depends on

the states the atoms occupy [8]. This allows precise determination of the positions of the

resonances and magnitudes of the scattering lengths a12, a13, and a23. Usually the ranges of

the magnetic ﬁeld where the values of a12 and a23 are signiﬁcant largely overlap. However,

a13 is relevant in a completely diﬀerent range of the external magnetic ﬁeld [8].

In the

present work, we assume a simpliﬁed model where a12 = a13 = a23 ( or aGR = aGB = aRB

as we will deﬁne later), leaving the channel dependent interactions to future study.

On the other hand, it is known that at extreme pressure and temperature the matter

breaks down to its basic constituents and forms a ﬂuid of quarks known as ‘quark matter’.

The quarks come in three ‘ﬂavors’; up, down and strange. The phase diagram for this type of

matter can present a type of superconductivity known as ‘color superconductivity’ produced

by the mechanism of the pairing [9].

The suggested complete phase diagram has hadronic ﬂuid at low temperature and pres-

sure. Here the quarks are conﬁned inside of the neutrons and protons. As the temperature

and pressure are increased, the hadronic matter enters the phase known as Quark Gluon

Plasma (QGP) as mentioned above. It is at relatively low temperature but at very high

pressure that the regime of the color superconducting quark matter may be realized.

3

Quark interaction is by the strong force. The quark pairs cannot be color-neutral and the

superconducting state breaks the color symmetry making the gluons massive. The phase of

superconducting quark matter can be in diﬀerent subphases as the function of the density

or pressure.

It is suggested that at the highest pressure the so-called color-ﬂavor-locked

(CFL) paring is realized where all three quark ﬂavors participate symmetrically.

In the

intermediate density regime, many possibilities are suggested such as crystalline pairing,

two ﬂavor pairing, etc.

The current survey does not intend to be exhaustive. Instead, it focuses on the possi-

bility of realizing ground state with pairing through short but ﬁnite range and attractive

interaction. The emphasis is given to the broken symmetry pairing [7, 10] where only two

components participate in the pairing while the third component remains in the normal

phase. First, we start by reviewing three body(trimer) binding problem. Three body bind-

ing energies depend on the range of the potential and diverges in the limit where the range

approaches zero. In addition, as the pair interaction approaches scattering length a = −∞,

inﬁnite number of shallow bound states appear one after another. They are known as Eﬁmov

states [11, 12, 13, 14]. This property is strikingly diﬀerent from the two body bound case,

and consequently qualitatively diﬀerent behavior of the three component ﬂuid is expected.

This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we consider three body problem. Critical

potential strength for the three body bound state is estimated. Scaling behavior is also

analyzed. In section III, three component Fermi ﬂuid is analyzed by quantum Monte Carlo

method. The conclusions are given in the section IV where s = 2 and s = 3 Fermi ﬂuids are

compared.

II. THREE BODY BOUND STATE WITH SHORT RANGE INTERACTIONS

L.H. Thomas [15] noted that in the nucleus of tritium (3H) which has two neutrons and

one proton, the binding energy has no lower bound if we assumed ﬁnite negative s-wave

scattering length a for the proton-neutron interactions and take the range of the interaction

4

to zero. This is in stark contrast to the pair binding and we interpret it as a consequence of

the scaling properties as we will discuss in section II B.

For our argument, we consider a simple three body Hamiltonian

In two body systems the bound state threshold is when

variational wave functions.

A. Estimate of ac

We can give a simple argument to estimate approximately three body ac

2 = ±∞. Suppose a system of three bosons (or fermions in diﬀerent spin states)

in vacuum in which the particles interact with each other by a two body potential of the

form V(r) = v0V (r) ≤ 0. V(r) implicitly assumes a ﬁnite and eﬀective range R given by

parameter µ ≈ 2/R. V (r) can be deﬁned such that the potential strength v0 = 1 corresponds

to a = ±∞ and 0 < v0 < 1 for 1/a < 0 and 1 < v0 < vmax for 1/a > 0. vmax is the upper

bound when the sign of a changes again by jumping to the next branch. For 1 ≤ v0 we know
that two body bound state is possible. We deﬁne Pij = 1

The Schr¨odinger equation has units of energy and length related by ¯h2/m which has

dimensions of EL2. The energy scale is irrelevant in determining the threshold for bound

state. In the case of two body, the threshold at a → ±∞ is independent of the length scale.

In contrast, three body threshold appears at a ﬁnite value of a < 0 and as we will see later it

depends on the choice of the length scale. It can be easily checked that vc

room for improvement. An improved bound state trial wave function and energy can be

obtained (hH3itrial1 of Tab I) by following the method described by Pandharipande et al.

[16, 17]. Here, the trial wave function is constructed as for the many boson droplet. The

ﬁnite and smooth at r = 0. Resulting trial energies hH3itrial1/3 are in close agreement with

GFMC energies.

The fact that ac

3 is ﬁnite (not the unitary limit) and negative is a starting point for an

interesting analysis about the scaling behavior of the length parameters. When we apply

rescaling of the length by taking µ → µ/α (or R → αR), then a → αa and hH3i → hH3i/α2
must satisfy. By making α → 0+ we expect a3

Since the particles are in vacuum, we are free to rescale the unit of length by a factor α.

That is, all the length quantities get multiplied by a common factor α. In particular, the

scattering length is modiﬁed by the overall rescaling of the length. We can verify this from

the following observation. Assuming that the coordinate r has been scaled, the scattering

equation becomes

Rs = αR. We denote the scaled quantities by subindex s. The scattering length behaves as

−

as expected. Thus in the limit α → 0+, we have the scaled range Rs → 0 and as = αa → 0−
if a < 0, and as → 0+ if a > 0. Clearly, this scaling property is independent of the particular

shape of the potential although we used the analytical expression Eq 14 to simplify the

discussion. The key point is that the s-wave scattering length a scales exactly the same as

another length quantity R.

Now, we consider length scaling with the system of three particles in vacuum. We saw

that trimer bound state can happen at a given R and strength vc

This scaling property also holds true for any negative potential with ﬁnite range R.

scale length by overall factor 0 < α < 1 but keep a constant (that is, increase |as| to match

|a|). It is obvious that taking α → 0+ makes Es(αa) → −∞. This means that when R → 0

at a ﬁxed value of a, E goes to −∞ for three body bound state in vacuum.

On the other hand, suppose that we have initially 1/a < 1/ac

3 < 0, that is, the potential
is not strong enough to have bound state. The energy for such system is E = 0 in the

vacuum. Even after length scaling, we do not have bound state Es(αa) = 0.

For the comparison purpose, let’s consider scaling behavior of the system of two particles.

We can see that the scaling of length does not produce the collapse as in the three body

case. For 1/a < 0 there is no bound state and the energy of the pair E = 0 at any length
scale. Then we consider 1/a > 0 regime. Again we have Es(αa) = E(a)

In the pair problem the binding energy scales as ∼ 1/α2 and unlike the trimer case there is

no ‘collapse’ at zero interaction range limit at ﬁnite a.

III. MANY BODY GROUND STATE

For the study of many body systems at ﬁnite density, we use ab initio stochastic method

known as Fixed Node Green’s Function Monte Carlo (FN GFMC), which can be optimized

to deal with the ‘fermion sign problem’.

In general, we take a trial wave function ΨV

antisymmetric upon the exchange of identical fermion particles and take the imaginary time

10

evolution restricted to a deﬁnite sign domain given by the nodal surface of the trial wave

function itself. If the nodal structure is correct, we get the exact ground state otherwise we

get approximate ground state and energy. The implementation of this method is explained

in detail in other publications [4, 5].

For matters of convenience and clarity, we classify the fermions by green(G), red(R), and

blue(B) species. These labels can also represent diﬀerent spin projection states the fermions

can occupy. We assume no matrix element for the Hamiltonian to connect diﬀerent ‘color’

states and given partial densities. A system of approximately 7 particles of each ‘color’

(18 ≤ Ntotal ≤ 24) is considered for the GFMC calculations. The particles are contained in

a ﬁnite box with periodic boundary conditions imposed at the walls to simulate the uniform

matter. For many body systems, we cannot rescale the length without changing the density.

The scaling behavior analyzed in the previous section is only applicable to the few body

systems in vacuum. In the degeneracy two case, one dimensionless product akF uniquely

determines the system. The parameter µ ∼ 2/R can be pushed in principle to the zero range

interaction limit µ → ∞ and eliminated from the description of the system. A speciﬁc value

of µ = 6.2526kF was assumed [4, 5] only for the practical considerations as the results are

within statistical errors of µ = ∞ limit. However, from the scaling behavior analysis of the

previous section, it becomes clear that for the degeneracy three many body systems we need

additional parameter RkF (or kF /µ) in addition to akF in order to characterize the system.

We keep µ = 6.2527kF also in the s = 3 case in order to compare the results with s = 2

case. However, we should keep in mind that for s = 3, this particular value of µ is not the

limit of zero range potential. µ dependent study is left for future works.

(22)

aGB = aRB and the same mass for all the particles. Thus, the Hamiltonian is symmet-

11

ric upon the renaming of the particle labels. We can impose diﬀerent nodal restriction to

the solution. We can test the energy expectation values by using Slater nodes given by

ΨF G = ΨF G,GΨF G,RΨF G,B, where the factors represent the normal states (Slater determi-

nants) of diﬀerent color species. We can also calculate energy with BCS pairing node for

two of the species. This nodal structure can be given by the trial wave function

Let us denominate this as broken symmetry pairing wave function. Here we assume that

species there is pairing correlation (given by ΨBCS,GR). In the last line of Eq 23 we assumed

color particles fP (rij) (= fGG(rij), fRR(rij), fBB(rij)) from the correlation between diﬀerent

color particles fD(rij) (= fGR(rij), fGB(rij), fRB(rij)). Usually fP (rij) is very diﬀerent from

fD(rij). fP (rij) is analogous to f

(r) of the degeneracy two case and reﬂects the law of Pauli

exclusion (fP (0) ≈ 0). The shapes of the correlation functions do not aﬀect the mean energy

value. However, they are optimized to get smaller statistical errors. Also they are optimized

to get the correct pair distribution function g(r) ∼ gtrial(r) ∼ gGF M C(r) as explained in

the reference [18]. We can see that the optimized fD(rij) is largely diﬀerent (more peaked

at r ≈ 0) than the one obtained using LOCV equations [4] at the same potential strength.

Here we see that the three body eﬀects predominate even when the interactions are pairwise

and relatively weak.

which can give better pair distribution functions as the optimization of the correlation

functions can be carried out separately for fGR(r) and fGB(r) = fRB(r). Then we can see

that fGR(0) < fGB(0) as well as gGR(0) < gGB(0) (discussion in the next section). The

approximate optimum nodal structure is tried as αI = {0.2, 0.1, 0.02, 0.01, 0.01} with non
zero short range function ˜β(r) parameterized by b = 0.44 (see [4, 5]). These parameters are

identical to those of the s = 2 case when 1/akF ≥ 0 (strongly interacting regime). This

trial wave function assumes arbitrarily one of three possible broken symmetry pairing states

(ΨF G,BΨBCS,GR, ΨF G,RΨBCS,GB and ΨF G,GΨBCS,RB).

It is obvious that these states are

degenerate in energy without losing generality.

in units of EF G. In the original BCS formalism, the chemical potential µc is kept constant and

the density is varied. Instead, we can consider BCS-Leggett [19] variational formalism where

the density is kept constant and the chemical potential is varied. We can estimate some of

the values. At 1/akF = −1, we have ∆BCS

Leggett = 0.33EF G and Econd/N ≈ −0.02EF G.

At 1/akF = −0.75 , we have ∆BCS

Leggett = 0.5EF G and Econd/N ≈ −0.04EF G.

The FN GFMC results are summarized in the Fig 1. The pairing correlations produce

noticeable eﬀects at 1/akF ≥ −1 (compare the triangles with the circles of Fig 1). Close to

the ac

3, that is ac

3kF ≈ −0.75 (or ac

3µ ≈ −4.7), the pairing eﬀect is small and the GFMC

energies with the broken symmetry wave function nodes are not distinguishable within the

statistical sampling errors from the ones obtained using non-pairing Slater nodes. Since

EGF M C/N > Etrimer/3, we have stability in the regime of interaction considered in this
work (−1. ˙3 ≤ 1/akF ≤ −0.5 and µ = 6.25kF ).

It is also possible to see the eﬀects of pairing in the g(r)’s. In the ﬁgure 2 for akF = −0.75 ,

no diﬀerence can be seen in the g(r) because the pairing is weak. However, where the pairing

is relevant (in terms of the energy) we notice that gGR(0) < gGB(0) = gRB(0) < gSlater(0)

(where gSlater(r) is the pair distribution obtained with the non-pairing Slater nodes) and

the symmetry is broken (see the ﬁgures 4 and 5). Green and red particles are paired, so one

may have naively expected gGR(0) > gGB(0) = gRB(0), but the opposite is true. According

to this rGB < rGR and rRB < rGR. The interpretation is that once we have a correlated pair,

the third particle feels much stronger attraction toward the center of the mass of the pair. In

fact, we can crudely approximate the strength of the center of mass (CM) of green-red pair

and the blue particle interaction by 4

3 v0, while green and red particles interact with strength
v0. This comes from the observation that the zero energy scattering equation between the

CM of green-red and blue is

−

¯h2
2mr

u′′(r) + v0V (r)u(r) = 0 ,

(28)

with mr = 2
argument we get an estimate of ac

3m and relating it to the simple two body scattering equation. Using this
3µ ≈ −4.6 which is again close

3 (by taking 4

0 = 1) as ac

3vc

14

to the previous estimate of section II (ac

3µ ≈ −4.7). From the Fig 5, it is still not conclusive
whether the symmetry is restored (gGR(0) = gGB(0) = gRB(0)) in the interaction regime

1/akF > −0.5.

Energy gaps can also be calculated by allowing variations in the numbers of the green and

red particles keeping the number of blue particles constant. We can consider {NG, NR, NB} =

{6, 6, 6},{7, 6, 6},{7, 7, 6}, and {7, 7, 7},{8, 7, 7},{8, 8, 7}. We observe the usual staggering of

the ground state energy (Fig 6). We can allow the variation 6 ≤ NG ≤ 8, 6 ≤ NR ≤ 8, and

6 ≤ NB ≤ 8 and study the excitation spectrum. The minimum excitations at akF = −1 and
−1. ˙3 are found at k = 0. This is analogous to the s = 2 case in the 1/akF > 0 regime. Thus
the studied regime (−1. ˙3 ≤ 1/akF ≤ −0.5) is that of strong correlation for the s = 3 Fermi
gas. The excited state energies are shown in the Fig 6 for the −1. ˙3. The gap ∆ is estimated

from the points represented by circles at total N = 18, 19, 20 and N = 21, 22, 23. Calculated

∆ ≈ 0.2 and 0.5EF G respectively, which are around the order of magnitude of the statistical

errors ∼ 0.3EF G. The errors are large because gap energies are small relative to the energy

per particle. These gaps are also around the same order as the gap obtained by BCS-Leggett

formalism [19] where ∆ ≈ 0.5EF G at the same value of akF . In the Fig 6, we notice that

the energy dips when N is a multiple of 3. We interpret this as an eﬀect analogous to that

observed in the g(r)’s. This is the evidence that the trimer interaction that brings together

green-red pair and blue particle is much stronger than simple intra-pair interaction. Thus

completing green-red-blue trimer is energetically more favorable than unbalanced excess of

one or two species. In fact, the trimer binding energy is so strong that ∆ < |Etrimer/3| in

contrast to ∆ > |Epair/2| of s = 2 ﬂuid. We also notice that at N = 21 the dip is as deep

as at N = 24 which indicates possible ‘shell closure’ eﬀect.

For this work, we assumed an arbitrary interaction range and other simpliﬁcations. Here

the qualitative diﬀerences between the s = 2 and s = 3 Fermi gases have been discussed.

Realistic potential with physical range and channel dependence of the interactions are nec-

essary in order to produce not only qualitative but also quantitatively correct results.

However for s = 3, the match is poor with GFMC results. In the region of −1 < 1/akF < −0.5,

the broken symmetry pairing state is believed to be the ground state for s = 3 Fermi ﬂuid.

EGF M C/N > Etrimer/3 in the considered regime of interaction and the system is stable.

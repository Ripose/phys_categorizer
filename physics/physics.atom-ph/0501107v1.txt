Abstract

In a recent paper we proposed the expansion of the space of variations in energy calculations by

considering the approximate wave function ψ to be a functional of functions χ : ψ = ψ[χ] rather

than a function. For the determination of such a wave function functional, a constrained search is

ﬁrst performed over the subspace of all functions χ such that ψ[χ] satisﬁes a physical constraint or

leads to the known value of an observable. A rigorous upper bound to the energy is then obtained

by application of the variational principle. To demonstrate the advantages of the expansion of

variational space, we apply the constrained-search–variational method to the ground state of the

negative ion of atomic Hydrogen, the Helium atom, and its isoelectronic sequence. The method

is equally applicable to excited states, and its extension to such states in conjunction with the

theorem of Theophilou is also described.

1. Introduction

In the traditional application of the variational principle for the energy [1], the space of

variations is limited by the choice of the analytical form chosen for the approximate wave

function. For example, if Gaussian or Slater-type orbitals or a linear combination of such

orbitals is employed in the energy functional of the wave functions, then the variational

space is limited by this choice of functions of the wave functions. In a recent paper [2] we

proposed the idea of overcoming this limitation by expanding the space over which the

variations are performed. This allows for a greater ﬂexibility for the structure of the wave

function. A consequence of this greater variational freedom is that better energies can be

obtained. Or, equivalently, fewer variational parameters are needed to achieve a required

accuracy.

The manner by which the space of variations can be expanded in principle is by

considering the approximate wave function ψ to be a functional of a set of functions

χ : ψ = ψ[χ], rather than a function. The space of variations is expanded because the

functional ψ[χ] can be adjusted through the function χ to reproduce any well behaved

function. The space over which the search for the functions χ is to be performed, however,

is too large for practical purposes, and a subset of this space must be considered. The

subspace over which the search for the functions χ is to be performed is deﬁned by the

requirement that the wave function functional ψ[χ] satisfy a constraint. Typical constraints

on the functional ψ[χ] are those of normalization, the satisfaction of the Fermi-Coulomb

hole sum rule, the requirement that it lead to observables such as the electron density,

diamagnetic susceptibility, nuclear magnetic constant, Fermi contact term, or any other

physical property of interest. With the wave function functional ψ[χ] thus determined, a

rigorous upper bound to the energy is obtained by application of the variational principle.

In this manner, a particular property of interest is obtained exactly while simultaneously

the energy is determined accurately. We refer to this way of determining an approximate

wave function as the constrained-search–variational method. The method is general in that

it is applicable to both ground and excited states.

In section 2 of the paper, we explain the constrained-search–variational method in

2

further detail. To demonstrate the ideas involved, we apply the method in section 3 to the

ground state of the Helium atom, its isoelectronic sequence, and the negative ion of atomic

Hydrogen. Concluding remarks are made in section 4.

2. Constrained- search–variational method

To explain the method for the determination of a wave function functional, consider the

non-relativistic Hamiltonian of the Helium atom, the ions of its isoelectronic sequence, and
the negative ion of atomic Hydrogen. In atomic units (e = ~ = m = 1)

where r1, r2 are the coordinates of the two electrons, r12 is the distance between them,

and Z is the atomic number. In terms of the Hylleraas coordinates[3]: s = r1 + r2, t =

r1 −r2, u = r12, which are the natural coordinates for this atom, we choose the approximate

wave function functional to be of the general form

ψ[χ] = Φ(s, t, u)[1 − f (χ; s, t, u)],

with Φ(s, t, u) a Slater determinantal pre-factor and f (χ; s, t, u)] a correlated correction term:

f (s, t, u) = e−qu(1 + qu)[1 − χ(q; s, t, u)(1 + u/2)],

where q is a variational parameter. Note any two electron wave function in a ground or

excited state maybe expressed in this form. The Slater determinant may be chosen to be the

Hartree-Fock theory wave function [4], or determined self-consistently within the framework

of Quantal Density Functional Theory [5]. For purposes of explanation, we consider here

the determinant composed of Hydrogenic functions. Thus, for the ground state 11S of
the Helium atom we have Φ[α, s] = (α3/π)e−αs, and for the excited triplet 23S state
2/3(α4/π)e−αst. (In the latter, for explanatory purposes, screening eﬀects are

Φ[α, s, t] =

ignored). Further, we assume that χ is a function only of the variable s: Ψ = Ψ[χ(q, s)].

p

The approximate wave function functional Ψ[χ(q, s)] for the ground state then satisﬁes the

electron-electron cusp condition [6]. It also satisﬁes the electron-nucleus cusp condition for

Next consider observables such as the size of the atom, diamagnetic susceptibility, nuclear

operators W = r1 + r2, W = r2

magnetic constant, Fermi contact term, etc, which are represented by the expectation of
2, W = 1/r1 + 1/r2, W = δ(r1) + δ(r2), respectively. For
the normalization constraint W = 1. In terms of the Hylleraas coordinates, these operators
are W (s) = s, W (s, t) = (s2 + t2)/2, W (s, t) = 4s

δ( (s−t)

(s−t)2 ], and

W (s, t) = 1. In general, observables can be represented by single-particle operators expressed

as W (s, t). The expectation of the operator W (s, t) is then

hW i =

Ψ∗[χ]W Ψ[χ]dτ = hW0i + ∆W,

where (for the ground state)

hW i0 =

|Φ(α, s)|2W (s, t)dτ,

We now assume that the expectation hW i is known either through experiment or via

some accurate calculation [7]. As our choice of Φ(α; s) is analytical, then both hW i0 and

∆W are now known.

The next step is the constrained search over functions χ(q, s) for which the expectation

hW i of Eq.(4) is obtained.

If the parameter α in Eq.(7) is ﬁxed, then there exist many

functions g(s) for which the expectation hW i can be obtained. This corresponds to a large

subspace of wave function functionals (See Ref. 2). On the other hand, if the parameter α

is variable, then the only way in which Eq.(7) can be satisﬁed is if

g(s) = G,

(9)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

where G is a determinable constant. This is equivalent to the constrained search of all wave

function functionals over the subspace in which Eq.(7) is satisﬁed.

As an example consider the normalization constraint for which hW i = hW i0 = 1, so that

∆W = 0. Then the only way in which Eq.(7) can be satisﬁed, (for variable α) is if

g(s) = 0.

(10)

This condition is thus equivalent to the constrained search over the subspace of all

normalized functionals Ψ[χ(q, s)].

Substitution of f (χ; s, t, u) into Eq.(10) leads to a quadratic equation for the function

χ(q, s):

where

a(q, s)χ(q, s)2 + 2b(q, s)χ(q, s) + c(q, s) = 0,

a(q, s) =

The integrals for the coeﬃcents a(q, s), b(q, s), and c(q, s) are determined analytically.

Solution of the quadratic equation is equivalent to searching over the entire subspace of

normalized wave function functionals.

In this example, the subspace corresponds to two

points. The two solutions χ1(q; s) and χ2(q; s) lead to two normalized wave functions ψ[χ1]

and ψ[χ2].

The generalization to the case when W = W (s) or W = W (s, t) follows readily.

In

either case, one has also to solve a quadratic equation for the determination of the functions

χ(q, α; s). One thus obtains two wave function functionals that lead to the exact value for

is then minimized with respect to the parameters α and q. (The prefactor minimizes the

energy at α = Z − 5/16).

For wave function functionals determined by sum rules other than normalization, the

3. Application to two-electron atomic and ionic systems

In this section, we apply the constrained-search-variational method to two-electron

atomic and ionic systems. The two wave function functionals ψ[χ1] and ψ[χ2] employed are

those determined via the constraint of normalization as described in the previous section

with the crude Hydrogenic prefactor. In Table I we quote the values for the ground state
energy for H −, the He atom, and its isoelectronic sequence. For the He atom we also quote

the values of Hartree-Fock theory [4], the 3-parameter Caratzoulas-Knowles wave function
[8], and the 1078-parameter Pekeris wave function [7]. For H − and the other negative ions

corresponding to Z = 3 − 8, we give the values of the variational-perturbation results of

Aashamar [9]. The satisfaction of the virial theorem and the percent errors as compared

to the Pekeris and Aashamar values are also given. The functions χ1(q, s) and χ2(q, s) for
H −, B3+, and O6+ are plotted in Figs. 1-3.

FIG. 1: Fig.1: The functions χ1(q, s) and χ2(q, s) for H −.

Observe that the improvement of the energies of the two wave function functionals over

the prefactor values is generally an order of magnitude. As expected, the energies as well

as the satisfaction of the virial theorem improves with increasing atomic number Z. For

the He atom, the energies of both ψ[χ1] and ψ[χ2] are superior to those of Hartree-Fock

theory and of the 3-parameter Caratzoulas-Knowles wave function. Furthermore, whereas

the prefactor leads to a negative electron aﬃnity, both wave function functionals lead
to a positive electron aﬃnity for H − as must be the case as H − is stable. The exact

satisfaction of the virial theorem by the prefactor is a consequence of scaling, whereas that

of Hartree-Fock theory is because of self-consistency.

In Table II we quote the values of the operators W =

FIG. 2: Fig.2: The functions χ1(q, s) and χ2(q, s) for B3+.

W = δ(r1) + δ(r2) for the He atom as determined by both ψ[χ1] and ψ[χ2] together with

the Hartree-Fock theory, Caratzoulas-Knowles, and Pekeris values. The accuracy of these

results is, of course, not correct to second order as are those for the energy. Nonetheless, the

results are considerable improvements over the prefactor values. They are also all superior

to the 3-parameter results of Caratzoulas-Knowles. The latter indicates that the two

wave function functionals although also determined via energy minimization, are superior

throughout space. Thus, by expanding the space of variations, one obtains a superior wave

function not only in the region contributing most to the energy, but also in other regions of

space. The superiority of the Hartree-Fock theory values, on the other hand, is due to the

fact that in this theory, the expectations of single-particle operators is correct to second

order [10].

9

FIG. 3: Fig.3: The functions χ1(q, s) and χ2(q, s) for O6+.

We note that the two functions χ1(q, s) and χ2(q, s) are very diﬀerent from each other:

χ1(q, s) is positive whereas χ2(q, s) is negative. See Figs. 1-3. Thus, although the analytical

form of the wave function is the same, the two functionals ψ[χ1] and ψ[χ2] are very

diﬀerent. Nevertheless, they lead to accurate results that are essentially the same. Thus,

the constrained search for the functions χ over this subspace of normalized wave functions

leads to two physically meaningful functionals.

4. Concluding remarks

In this paper we have shown how to expand the space of variations in calculations of

the energy by constructing approximate wave functions that are functionals rather than

satisfy a sum rule or reproduce the value of an observable.

In this constrained-search-

variational method, wave functions that are accurate over all space are thereby obtained.

The framework presented is general and applicable to both ground and excited states. For

excited states, one would in addition employ the theorem of Theophilou [11] according to

which if ϕ1, ϕ2, , ϕm,..., are orthonormal trial functions for the m lowest eigenstates of the

Hamiltonian H, having exact eigenvalues E1, E2, Em,...

With the ground state energy known, a rigorous upper bound to the excited state energy is

then determined, while simultaneously a physical constraint or sum rule is satisﬁed or an

observable obtained exactly.

In the calculations presented to demonstrate these ideas, a crude Hydrogenic Slater

determinantal prefactor was employed. Improved results may be obtained through a better

prefactor. Fully self-consistently determined prefactors for many-electron systems may

be achieved, for example, via Quantal density functional theory. The latter is a local

eﬀective potential energy theory of noninteracting Fermions with the true density in which

11

the multiplicative potential energy operator representative of all the many-body eﬀects

is explicitly deﬁned in terms of the interacting system wave function and the orbitals of

this model system. These orbitals, determined self-consistently, then constitute the Slater

determinantal prefactor. Or one could employ analytical or self-consistently determined

Hartree-Fock theory orbitals for the prefactor. Another step towards improved results

would be to further expand the space of variations deﬁning the functions χ.

In such a

case, the equation for the functions χ could be an integral equation. Other analytical

forms for the correlation factor could also be employed. These avenues are being pursued

to better understand the ideas underlying the construction of wave function function-

als, and to employ these functionals within the context of Quantal density functional theory.

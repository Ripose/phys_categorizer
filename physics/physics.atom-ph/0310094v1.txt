The complete system of the B-spline solutions for the Dirac equation with the parity-
nonconserving (PNC) weak interaction eﬀective potential is obtained. This system can be used
for the accurate evaluation of the radiative corrections to the PNC amplitudes in the multicharged
ions and neutral atoms. The use of the scaling procedure allows for the evaluation of the PNC
matrix elements with relative accuracy 10−7.

I. INTRODUCTION

Consideration of the parity nonconservation (PNC) eﬀects in atoms provides an important veriﬁcation of the
Standard Electroweak Model in the low energy sector. The most important information provides the neutral Cs
atom, because the experimental and the theoretical accuracy is the best in this case. The analysis performed in [1]
and [2] has indicated a deviation of the measured weak charge value Qw from that predicted by the Standard Model
by 2.5 standard deviations σ. Later this value was diminishing and growing up again in a series of works [3]- [7].
It was understood that the radiative corrections to the PNC amplitude play an important role. This question was
investigated in [8]- [12] where both electron self-energy (SE) and vacuum polarization (VP) corrections were evaluated
by diﬀerent methods. However, in these calculations αZ expansion for SE (α is the ﬁne-structure constant, Z is the
charge of the nucleus), Uehling approximation for VP or other approximations were employed. To our mind the direct
accurate calculations of SE and VP without the use of any approximations are desirable. For this purpose we propose
in this paper the accurate spline solutions of the Dirac equation with the weak-interaction PNC potential.

Another possible area of application of PNC spline solutions could be the spectra of the Highly-Charged Ions (HCI).
Though no experimental results are available here up to now, the analysis of the PNC amplitude in the two-electron
ions can also provide an important test of the Standard Model [13]- [19]. The calculation of correlation eﬀects in
two-electron ions is much easier than in neutral atoms, but QED corrections are more important.

The rigorous direct way to the calculation of SE and VP corrections to the PNC amplitude (see [20]) is rather
cumbersome.
In order to avoid the diﬃculties and receive the accurate results we propose to use another way:
accurate solutions of the Dirac equation with the weak-interaction PNC potential. Having got the solutions of the
Dirac equation with this potential we can obtain self-energy corrections, using the standard methods [21] - [23] based
on the spline approximation [24], [25].
In this work we solve the ﬁrst part of the problem: the obtaining of the
complete basis set of accurate solutions of the Dirac equation with the weak PNC potential. The main diﬃculty
is the extreme smallness of the weak interactions in the atomic scale. To overcome this diﬃculty we change the
weak interaction potential by scaling it in such a way that it becomes signiﬁcant but still small enough to apply
the perturbation theory. Then we can obtain the necessary PNC matrix elements by simple rescaling. Actually our
numerical procedure appear to be so accurate that the scaling will become necessary only in few cases, for the most
singular operators and the enhancement of the weak interaction potential will not exceed 10 times.

II. DIRAC EQUATION WITH PNC WEAK INTERACTION

We employ atomic units me = e = ~ = 1 throughout the paper. Consider stationary Dirac equation with the

weak-interaction PNC potential

ψ (~r) = E ψ (~r)

where ~α,β are Dirac matrices, ~p, E are the electron momentum and energy, c
V (r) is the Coulomb potential of atomic nucleus (pointlike or extended) and Vw is the weak-interaction PNC potential.

This system of equations for the radial functions was ﬁrst derived in [28]. However in [28] only one certain solution
of Eq (7) was obtained. Our ﬁnite goal requires the knowledge of the complete system of the solutions of Eq (7). For
this purpose we use the B-spline approach [24], [25].

III. PARITY-NONCONSERVING B-SPLINE APPROACH

Using the Galerkin method (see [29] and [24]) we express the system of equations (7) in terms of the least action
principle. We use MIT bag-model boundary conditions [30], employed also in [24]. In case of PNC functions these
conditions look like

g1 ( R ) = f 1 ( R )
g2 ( R ) = f 2 ( R )

(

g1 ( 0 ) = 0
g2 ( 0 ) = 0 .

(

Here R is the size of a spherical box, where an atom or an ion is enclosed. We choose action functional S so that
condition δS = 0 leads to Eqs (7) and (9). Then we present the functions g1, g2, f 1 and f 2 in the form of the linear
4n symmetric generalized eigenvalue
combination of B-splines. The condition δS = 0 reduces to the system of 4n
i = 0, . . . , Nint, that was described
equations. For constructing the B-spline system we use the grid

ri = ρ4

×
i /Z,

in [25]. In our calculations we use the number of the grid intervals Nint = 200, the order of B-splines k = 9 and the
parameter, which deﬁnes the density of knots near zero (see [25]), hset = 0.0167.

In this paper we investigate the hydrogenlike ion 238U 91+. The box size was taken to be R

1.0 a.u. The parameters
of the Fermi distribution are c = 7.136 fm and a = 2.3/4 ln 3 [31]. As a ﬁrst test of the accuracy of our B-spline
approach, we set V (r) =
Z/r, Nw = 0 and compare the energy values from B-spline approach with low-lying energy
levels given by the Sommerfeld formula. The results are presented in the Table I in a.u. Our accuracy of calculation
of the energy 10−14 is the limit of accuracy for the calculation with Fortran double precision type of variables.

IV. SCALING AND THE NUMERICAL TESTS

As the next step we increase the PNC weak interaction by scaling Vw = Nw γ5 W (r), where Nw is the scaling
factor, and investigate the energy spectrum by changing Nw. Here we use the Fermi distribution for the nuclear
charge density.

The scaling problem looks as follows: to ﬁnd a scaling parameter Nw for which 1) the contribution of weak interaction
to the matrix elements of our interest is larger than numerical inaccuracy, 2) weak interaction is still small enough
for using the perturbation theory.

The Table III presents the PNC weak interaction contribution to the energy of the states for the diﬀerent values of
= 0 the states do not have a certain parity and we use the notations n˜s, n˜p formally classifying the
Nw. In case Nw 6
diﬀerent states by their origin. The analysis of the results of calculations shows that the dependence E = E(Nw) is
approximately parabolic. One can also obtain this result from the perturbation theory (PT):

undestand the B-spline method inaccuracy of calculation of nonperturbative energy value presented in the last column

The second-order PNC weak interaction correction to the energy is of no physical interest and was investigated
here only for the demonstration of the possibilities of the scaling procedure. This procedure helps to evaluate the
second-order PNC weak interaction correction even though this correction is beyond the level of accuracy of the spline
approximation.

We should emphasize that the matrix elements of our interest are the matrix elements with linear dependence on

weak interaction. SE and VP corrections to the PNC amplitude are the objects of this type.

For testing our system of PNC B-spline functions we calculated the set of the matrix elements

With these tests we check the completeness of the PNC B-spline spectrum (Eq (12)) and the absence of the higher
order PNC contributions after the introduction of the scaling parameter Nw i.e. the possibility of rescaling (Eq (13)).
The results are given in Table IV. The behaviour of the matrix elements with m = 2, 1 is similar. The most suitable
scaling parameters for the calculation of these matrix elements are Nw = 1 (the absence of the scaling) with relative
10−8. The test of completeness of the spectrum for these
accuracy 1
operators gives the relative accuracy 1

because of their singularity. For Nw = 1 the relative inaccuracy for the calculation of both matrix elements is about
10−7. The checking of completeness of the basis for this operators give the relative

accuracy 1
calculation of matrix element with linear dependence on weak interaction is Nw = 10. The accuracy of this calculation
is about 1

10−12. The most interesting matrix elements are the ones with m =

For this expression we obtain the value

10−10 eV. Then the sum of the ﬁrst and second orders terms is
10−8 eV. Then, the relative accuracy of calculation of the sum of the ﬁrst and second order terms is the same
−
10−5. Here we also lose two orders in accuracy due to subtraction of the leading terms in
as in the ﬁrst method: 2
Eq (17). In any case we can state emphasize that the accuracy of calculation of any PNC matrix elements is of order
10−7. Of course, one can lose the accuracy of calculation because of subtraction of two large values. The question of
the accuracy of calculation of some composite expression should be solved separately in each case. As we understand,
the calculation of the radiative corrections to the emission PNC amplitude should not contain any subtractions.

·

Concluding, we can say that the method developed here presents a powerful tool for the calculation of any corrections
to the PNC matrix elements in atoms and ions. The recommended scaling parameter is Nw = 1 or Nw = 10 and the
relative accuracy for the calculation of PNC matrix elements achieved in all cases is not less than 10−7. In particular,
this approach can be applied to the calculation of the radiative corrections to the emission PNC amplitude with high
accuracy without any approximations (αZ expansion, Uehling potential approximation and other). Including in our
scheme the Dirac-Hartree-Fock potential we can calculate these radiative corrections also for neutral atoms, e.g. for
Cs. It will help to solve ﬁnally the problem of the possible deviation of the measured weak charge value Qw from
that predicted by the Standard Model.

TABLE IV. The matrix elements < 2˜s1/2|rm|2˜p1/2 > (m=2,1,-1,-2) calculated by diﬀerent methods with the diﬀerent values
of the scaling parameter Nw = 10r. The ﬁrst line in the every box for a certain m and r values corresponds to the direct
evaluation of the matrix element with B-spline solution of the Dirac equation with PNC weak interaction. The second line
corresponds to the use of the formula Eq (12) in the text. The PT line corresponds to the perturbation theory evaluation via
the formula Eq (13) with Nw = 1. (in a.u.) The last column presents the results of evaluation of the Uehling matrix element
with the same methods.

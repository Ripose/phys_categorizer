We calculate the pair correlation function of an interacting Bose gas in a harmonic trap
directly via Path Integral Quantum Monte Carlo simulation for various temperatures and
compare the numerical result with simple approximative treatments. Around the critical
temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation, a description based on the Hartree-Fock
approximation is found to be accurate. At low temperatures the Hartree-Fock approach
fails and we use a local density approximation based on the Bogoliubov description
for a homogeneous gas. This approximation agrees with the simulation results at low
temperatures, where the contribution of the phonon-like modes aﬀects the long range
behavior of the correlation function. Further we discuss the relation between the pair
correlation and quantities measured in recent experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION

One of the appealing features of the experimental achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute
vapors [1–3], is the demonstration of ﬁrst order coherence of matter waves [4]. The interference pattern of
this experiment agrees with the theoretical calculation [5], which reveals that the underlying theoretical
concept of oﬀ-diagonal long range order due to a macroscopically occupied quantum state is justiﬁed [6].
Additional experiments have explored certain aspects of second and third order coherence of a trapped
Bose gas [7–9]. Here we study the density-density correlation function which is related to second order
coherence. With the knowledge of this pair correlation function, the total interaction energy can be
calculated. In [7] the release energy of the atoms was measured after switching oﬀ the magnetic trap. In
the Thomas Fermi regime at zero temperature the initial kinetic energy can be neglected and the release
energy is dominated by the interaction energy. By comparison with the usual mean ﬁeld interaction
energy using a contact potential, it was concluded that the release energy is mainly proportional to the
pair correlation function at vanishing relative distance. Strictly speaking this statement cannot be correct
as for interactions with a repulsive hard core the pair correlation function must vanish at zero distance.
To give a precise meaning to this statement one needs to access the whole correlation function.

In this paper we consider in detail the spatial structure of the correlation function of an interacting
trapped Bose gas. The Fourier transform of this function is directly related to the static structure factor
which can be probed by oﬀ-resonant light scattering. The tendency of bosonic atoms to cluster together
causes atom-bunching for an ideal gas above the condensation temperature, for the atoms separated by
less than the thermal de-Broglie wavelength [10]. For the condensate atoms, this bunching vanishes, since
they all occupy the same quantum state [11,12]. However, for a gas with strong repulsive interatomic

interaction, it is impossible to ﬁnd two atoms at exactly the same place, and hence the pair correlation
function must vanish at very short distances. This mutual repulsion can signiﬁcantly reduce the amount
of bosonic bunching at temperatures around the transition temperature [13]. At much lower temperature,
the presence of the condensate changes the excitation spectrum as compared to the noninteracting case.
It is known that in a homogeneous Bose gas the modes of the phonons give rise to a modiﬁcation of the
long range behavior of the correlation function [14].

Using path integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations all equilibrium properties of Bose gases can be
directly computed without any essential approximation [15]. It has been shown that this calculation can
be performed directly for the particle numbers and temperatures of experimental interest [16]. Here, we
use this approach to calculate the pair correlation function for various temperatures and compare our
results with simple approximate treatments.

Near the critical temperature our data are quantitatively well explained by an improved semiclassical
Hartree-Fock theory, where the full short range behavior is taken into account. At low temperature this
single-particle approximation fails since the low lying energy modes become important and they are not
correctly described by the Hartree-Fock treatment. In the Bogoliubov approach these modes are phonon-
like and change the behavior of the correlation function. Adapting the homogeneous Bogoliubov solution
locally to the inhomogeneous trap case we ﬁnd an excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation
results at low temperature.

The Hamiltonian of N interacting particles in an isotropic harmonic trap with frequency ω is given by

where V is the interatomic potential, which depends only on the relative distance rij =

two particles. This potential in the experiments with alkali atoms has many bound states, so that the
Bose-condensed gases are metastable systems rather than systems at thermal equilibrium. To circumvent
this theoretical diﬃculty, we have to replace the true interaction potential by a model potential with no
bound states.

This model potential is chosen in a way that it has the same low energy binary scattering properties as
the true interaction potential. In the considered experiments, the s-wave contribution strongly dominates
in a partial wave expansion of the binary scattering problem, so that it is suﬃcient that the model
potential have the same s-wave scattering length a as the true potential. For simplicity we take in
the quantum Monte Carlo calculations a pure hard-core potential with diameter a. In the analytical
approximations of this paper, we have taken, as commonly done in the literature, the pseudo-potential

The partition function Z of the system with inverse temperature β = (kBT )−1 is given as the trace

over the (unnormalized) density matrix ̺:

over all symmetrized states. Both satisfy the usual convolution equation which we can write in the
position representation:

Here τ = β/M , where M is an arbitrary integer, R is the 3N-dimensional vector of the particle coordinates
R = (~r1, ~r2, ..., ~rN ), P is a permutation of the N labels of the atoms and RP denotes the vector with
permuted labels: RP = (~rP (1), ~rP (2), ..., ~rP (N )). Since only density matrices at higher temperature (τ

are involved, high temperature approximations of the N -body density matrix can be used.

The simplest approximation is the primitive approximation corresponding to exp[τ (A + B)]
≃
exp[τ B/2] exp[τ A] exp[τ B/2], which neglects the commutator of the operators A and B. It corresponds
to a discrete approximation of the Feynman-Kac path integral and gives the correct result in the limit
[17,15]. This can be seen by using the Trotter formula for the exponentials of a sum of two

This approximation has the advantage to include exactly all binary collisions of atoms in free space, only
three and more atoms in close proximity will lead to an error; convergency with respect to M
is
reached much faster. In the simulation the two-particle correlation function g2 is equal to one for non-
interacting particles and plays the role of a binary correction term in presence of two-body interactions.
As in [16] we take N = 10, 000 particles with a hard-core radius of a = 0.0043(¯h/mω)1/2. The

As the atoms are in a trap rather than in free space, this quantity is not a function of the relative
coordinates ~r ′
~r ′′ of the two particles only. Imagine however that this pair distribution function
be probed experimentally by scattering of light by the atomic gas, where we assume a large beam
waist compared to the atomic sample. As the Doppler eﬀect due to the atomic motion is negligible,
the scattering cross section depends only on the spatial distribution of the atoms. Furthermore, for
a weak light ﬁeld very far detuned from the atomic transitions, the scattering cross section can be
calculated in the Born approximation; it then depends only on the distribution function of the relative
coordinates ~r ′
~r ′′ between pairs of atoms. We therefore take the trace over the center-of-mass position

where we have divided by the number of pairs of atoms to normalize ϕ(2) to unity. Note that the result

B. Results of the Simulation

In ﬁg.1 we show ϕ(2)(r, β) for various temperatures below T 0

c , obtained by the simulation of the
interacting bosons in the harmonic trap, where the critical temperature Tc is reduced compared to the
ideal gas [20,16,21]. All pair correlation functions are zero in the region of the hard-core radius as they
should. At larger length scales the r dependence of the result is also simple to understand qualitatively,
as we discuss now.

Consider ﬁrst the case T > Tc, where no condensate is present. As the typical interaction energy n(r)g
(n(r) being the total one-particle density at ~r) is much smaller than kBT , we expect to recover results
close to the ideal Bose gas. The size of the thermal cloud (kBT /mω)1/2 determines the spatial extent of
ϕ(2)(r); the bosonic statistics leads to a spatial bunching of the particles with a length scale given by the
thermal de Broglie wavelength

The Bose enhancement of the pair distribution function is maximal and equal to a factor of 2 for particles
at the same location (~r = 0). This eﬀect is preserved by the integration over the center of mass variable
and manifests itself through a bump on ϕ(2)(r) in ﬁg.1. Due to the inﬂuence of interactions the bump is
suppressed at small distances and the factor of 2 is not completely obtained.

For T < Tc a signiﬁcant fraction of the particles accumulate in the condensate. As the size of the
condensate is smaller than that of the thermal cloud, the contribution to ϕ(2) of the condensed particles
has a smaller spatial extension, giving rise to wings with two spatial components in ϕ(2), as seen in ﬁg.1.
Apart from this geometrical eﬀect the building up of a condensate also aﬀects the bosonic correlations at
the scale of λT : The bosonic bunching at this scale no longer exists for particles in the condensate. This
property, referred to as a second order coherence property of the condensate [7,8,13], is well understood
in the limiting case T = 0; neglecting corrections due to interactions, all the particles are in the same
quantum state
so that e.g. the 2-body density matrix factorizes in a product of one-particle pure
state density matrices. This reveals the absence of spatial correlations between the condensed particles.
This explains why in ﬁg.1 the relative height of the exchange bump with respect to the total height is
reduced when T is lowered, that is when the number of non-condensed particles is decreased.

IV. COMPARISON WITH SIMPLE APPROXIMATE TREATMENTS

At this stage a quantitative comparison of the Quantum Monte Carlo results with well known approx-

imations can be made.

A. In presence of a signiﬁcant thermal cloud: Hartree-Fock approximation

As shown in [21] in detail, at temperatures suﬃciently away from the critical temperature, the Hartree-

Fock approximation [20] gives a very good description of the thermodynamic one-particle properties.

To derive the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian we start from the second quantized form of the Hamiltonian

with contact potential

where H0 is the single particle part of the Hamiltonian. Due to the presence of the condensate we split
the ﬁeld operator ˆΨ in a classical part ψ0, corresponding to the macroscopically occupied ground state
and the part of the thermal atoms ˆψ with vanishing expectation value

= 0:

ˆψ
i
h

ˆΨ(~r)

ψ0(~r) + ˆψ(~r).

After this separation we make a “quadratization” of the Hamiltonian by replacing the interaction term
by a sum over all binary contractions of the ﬁeld operator, keeping one or two operators uncontracted,
e.g.

This is done in such a way that the mean value of the right hand side agrees with the mean value of
the left hand side in the spirit of Wick’s theorem. In the Hartree-Fock approximation we neglect the
anomalous operators, such as ˆψ† ˆψ†, and their averages, and we end up with a Hamiltonian which is
quadratic in ψ0 and ˆψ, but also linear in ˆψ and ˆψ†. Now we choose ψ0 such that these linear terms vanish
in order to force

we can work out the nondiagonal matrix elements of the density operator which give rise to the exchange

Up to now the short range correlations due to the hard core repulsion have not been taken into account,

atoms at the same location: We assume that the particle at ~r interacts with the full Hamiltonian with the
particle at ~r ′ but only with the mean-ﬁeld of all others (over which we integrated to derive the reduced

Further we used the fact that g2 ≃

it will only slightly aﬀect the density, so we neglect this iteration procedure. Using the solution of the
coupled Hartree-Fock equations to calculate (29), and integrating over the center-mass-coordinate, we
get ϕ(2)

B. The quasi-pure condensate: Bogoliubov approach

The Hartree-Fock description must fail near zero temperature: Since the anomalous operators ˆψ† ˆψ†
and ˆψ ˆψ have been neglected, it describes not well the low energy excitations of the systems. It is known
that the zero temperature behavior can be well described by the Bogoliubov approximation [23]. In
this paper it is not our purpose to calculate the correlation function using the complete Bogoliubov
approach in the inhomogeneous trap potential. This could be performed using approaches developed
in [24,25]. Here we use the homogeneous description of the Bogoliubov approximation and adapt it to
the inhomogeneous trap case with a local density approximation. This approach already includes the
essential features which the Hartree-Fock description neglects at low temperatures.

We start with the description of the homogeneous system with quantization volume V and uniform
density n = N/V . As in [26] we split the ﬁeld operator ˆΨ into a macroscopically populated state Φ and
a remainder, which accounts for the noncondensed particles:

ˆΨ(r) = Φ(r)ˆaΦ + δ ˆΨ(r).

, keeping N/V = n and N g = const, the typical matrix
In the thermodynamic limit N
elements of δ ˆΨ at low temperatures are √N times smaller than ˆaΦ. Hence we can neglect terms cubic
and quartic in δ ˆΨ, when we insert (30) in the expression of the density-density correlation function (20).
Since the condensate density is given by the total density minus the density of the excited atoms, we have
to express the operator of the condensate density in the same order of approximation for consistency,

where ξ = (8πna)−1/2 is the healing length of the condensate. For ﬁnite but small temperatures this
structure is only slightly changed (see appendix). The modiﬁcation of the low energy spectrum due to
the Bogoliubov approach is responsible for the long range part of the correlation function.

Apart from the edge of the condensate, the total density n(r) for low temperature in the trapped
system varies rather slowly compared to the healing length ξ for the considered parameters. So it is
possible to adapt the result of the homogeneous system to the inhomogeneous trap case. For a given
density n(r) we get with a local density approximation for the pair correlation function instead of eq.(35)

As shown in ﬁg.2 this gives an excellent agreement with the Quantum Monte Carlo results at low
temperature. We have checked that at this temperature the diﬀerence with the Bogoliubov solution at
T = 0 is almost negligible. The good agreement with the simulation reﬂects that the long range behavior
of the pair correlation function in this approximation is correctly described by eq.(37). We note that in an
intermediate temperature regime, which is not shown, both approaches, the Hartree-Fock and the local
density Bogoliubov calculation, do not reproduce the simulation results quantitatively: The maximum
local error is about 5%.

ϕ(2)(0, β) for vanishing interparticle distances is obtained.

VI. CONCLUSION

We numerically calculated the pair correlation function of a trapped interacting Bose gas with a
Quantum Monte Carlo simulation using parameters typical for recent experiments of Bose-Einstein con-
densation in dilute atomic gases. At temperatures around the critical point, an improved Hartree-Fock
approximation was found to be in good quantitative agreement with the Monte Carlo results. The im-
proved Hartree-Fock calculation presented in this paper takes the short-range behavior of the correlation
function into account, especially the fact that two particles can never be found at the same location.
At low temperature we compared our simulation results to a local density approximation based on the
homogeneous Bogoliubov approach. The phonon spectrum changes the behavior of the pair correlation
function for distances r of the order of the healing length ξ. With the knowledge of the pair correlation
function we calculated the total interaction energy. We showed that the results of recent experiments
on second order coherence do not measure the true correlation function, which has to vanish for small
interparticle distances. Only an extrapolated correlation function is determined, where the exact short
range behavior disappears.

VII. APPENDIX

In this appendix we give the explicit formulas for the pair correlation function in the Bogoliubov
approach for an homogeneous system and discuss its behavior at short and long distances, since only
some aspects have been discussed in literature [14,28]. Starting from eq.(35), the pair correlation function
φ(2)
n=const can be be written explicitly as:

T = 0 :

T

f (0) = 0,
f (0) = 0,

f (2)(0) = 1
f (2)(0) = 0,

f (4)(0) = 0, ...

and the long range behavior at zero temperature given in (37) is obtained. For ﬁnite temperature it can
be shown that f (q) is an odd function of q, so that f (2n)(0) = 0 for all n. Due to that the correlation
function vanishes faster than any power law in 1/R.

To work out an explicit expression for ﬁnite temperatures we use this antisymmetry to extend the
and we can analytically calculate the expression for two limiting cases
range of the integral (43) to
via the residue calculus. For large distances we only have to take the poles q0 of f (q) with the smallest
modulus into account. For λT /2π

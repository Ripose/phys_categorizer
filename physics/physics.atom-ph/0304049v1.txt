Abstract

We determine exact recurrence relations which help in the evalu-
ation of matrix elements of powers of the radial coordinate between
Dirac relativistic hydrogenic eigenstates. The power λ can be any com-
plex number as long as the corresponding term vanishes faster than

. These formulas allow determining recursively any ma-
trix element of radial powers —rλ or βrλ, β is a Dirac matrix— in
terms of the two previous consecutive elements. The results are useful
in relativistic atomic calculations.

1 Introduction

Matrix elements of the radial coordinate have been very important since the
early days of quantum mechanics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. These quantities
are a crucial link between theoretical predictions and the observed facts. For
example, they are needed for studies of the behaviour of Rydberg electrons
in external ﬁelds, or in any calculation involving the multipolar expansion of
electromagnetic ﬁelds [9]. On the other hand, the interest in calculating rel-
ativistic eﬀects on high Z atomic or ionic transitions[10] requires calculating
matrix elements between relativistic eigenstates of the Dirac hydrogen atom.
Experiments with precisions of the order of 10−3 eV or less are now standard.
For example, experiments performed using new photon sources for the Opac-
ity and Iron Projects, or experiments with merged beam techniques, or the
use of specialized laser sources [11, 12, 13]. All of these mean that relativistic
eﬀects can be quite easily observed in atomic, molecular or ionic processes
and, therefore, that techniques for evaluating relativistic expectation values
are quite useful—as has been known for some time now [14].

The nonrelativistic evaluation of matrix elements has a long and succesful
history, but the relativistic eﬀorts have mainly come from the last 35 years
or so. We have to pinpoint however, that even these relativistic calcula-
tions, even exact ones, are an approximation, for the only way of calculating
exactly relativistic eﬀects in the interaction of atoms with electromagnetic
ﬁelds is using the full QED formalism. See, for example, [15]. But even so,
many calculations use a nonrelativistic approach recurring to the Schr¨odinger
equation —which is also a valid approximation [16]. Even in the relativistic
quantum mechanics approximation, in many circunstances it is much better
to have recursion relations between power-of-r terms than to have to deal
with the cumbersome and complex formulas that stem from the exact eval-
uation of the matrix elements [17]. Furthermore, all what is needed in many
ocassions is to have the matrix elements for exponents in a certain range, so
it is very convenient to have recursion formulas [18]. For instance, the be-
haviour of Rydberg electrons in external ﬁelds, or the long range interactions

of ionic cores [19]. Thus, we have been investigating such formulas in Dirac
relativistic quantum mechanics. We have discovered various of such expres-
sions since, perhaps not surprisingly, there appears to be more independent
recursions. We have been applying an hypervirial inspired technique that
have produced excelent results in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics [20] to
uncover some of the recurrence relations, but we are now combining that
technique with operator algebra [21] to generalize the previously obtained
recurrence relations to more compact recursions; equations (44) and (45) in
section 3. An advantage of these recursions is that they are able to relate
only three consecutive powers of r or βr—to be compared with the results
in [6, 18]

Our paper is organized as follows. In section 2 the relativistic quantum
mechanics of an hydrogen atom is reviewed since all the discussions that
follows use its energy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. A useful feature of
our discussion is that we express compactly the relativistic eigenfunctions in
terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials of noninteger index [22, 23]. The
relativistic recurrence relations of matrix elements of powers of the radial
coordinate are derived in section 3. Section 4 gathers the deﬁnitions of the
symbols we use for writing compactly these recurrence relations. Section 5
contains our conclusions.

nents of the spinorial wavefunctions Ψ, n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., j = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, . . .

electron, and ǫ = (

It is convenient to point out that the quantum number ǫ we use is related
to the often used κ [10] as κ =

sake of simplicity we often use the single symbol a to mean all the three
quantum numbers na, ja, ǫa, and write the radial wave functions in ket (or
bra) form as Ψa ≡ |

One of the advantages of the approach developed here is that is not only
applicable to Dirac hydrogenic wavefunctions but can also be used within
the quantum defect approximation, as discussed by Owono Owono, Kwato
Njock, and Oumarou [8], see also [7]. This feature is important since the
quantum deﬀect approximation describes accurately the behaviour of Ryd-
berg electrons in atomic systems [7, 8, 29, 30, 31].

3 Relativistic recursion relations

Using hypervirial methods we have recently obtained a useful form of re-
currence relations for atomic eigenstates. In this work we want to discuss
the additional use of operator algebra to obtain alternative and indepen-
dent expressions for recurrence relations of atomic expectation values. Let
us begin with the radial Dirac equation for an electron in an arbitarry radial
potential V (r), where the index a serves to distinguish Hamiltonians with
diﬀerent quantum numbers and it is convenient to distinguish wavefunctions
with diﬀerent energy eigenvalues.

Let us begin with the Dirac radial equation written with a certain radial

potential that afterwards will be identiﬁed with Coulomb’s

here Ha is the Dirac Hamiltonian, the energy eigenvalue Ea is given by (13),
and a is an index that will be quite useful in what follows.

To begin with, let us consider an arbitrary radial function f (r) and deﬁne
f H1. To obtain the recurrence relations, let us establish that

The LHS of equations (24) to (28) are to be substituted into equation (17).
Then, after introducing explicitly the Coulomb potential V1 = V2 =

imposing the equality of the masses m1 = m2 (since H1 and H2 describe
the same system), substituting the arbitrary function f (r) for the potential
function rλ, and taking matrix elements between states
at the

[18]]. This is nice since it serves as a way of checking the above recursions.
The coeﬃcients in equations (38), (39), (40), (41), (42), and (43) are all
gathered in section 4.

The equations (38) and (39) above express two forms of a recurrence
relation relating matrix elements of rλ with matrix elements of rλ−i, i =
1, 2, 3. This is a manifestation of the richer behaviour — though at the
same time more restricted — of relativistic quantum mechanics as compared
with the nonrelativistic theory. We can combine anyway equation (38) with
equation (39) to get the simpler relation

5 Conclusion

In this paper we have derived exact recurrence relations between general
non-necessarily diagonal matrix elements of powers of the radial coordinate.
These recursions relate any three consecutive powers of r or of βr. The states
used for evaluating the matrix elements are radial completely relativistic hy-
drogenic eigenstates. The derivation was done employing a technique inspired
in the hypervirial method and using some operator algebra [2, 3, 4, 20]. The
matrix elements analysed here are all gauge invariant [8]. The relations ob-
tained may have diﬀerent uses in many interesting atomic calculations, as in
the calculation of transitions between Rydberg states beyond the semiclassi-
cal approximation [14, 32].

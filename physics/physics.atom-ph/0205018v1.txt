We consider a nonlinear version of the Landau-Zener problem, focusing on photoassociation of
a Bose-Einstein condensate as a speciﬁc example. Contrary to the exponential rate dependence
obtained for the linear problem, a series expansion technique indicates that, when the resonance is
crossed slowly, the probability for failure of adiabaticity is directly proportional to the rate at which
the resonance is crossed.

Modern mathematical physics is replete with series ex-
pansion techniques. For example, series expansions have
been used to solve an ion in a Paul trap [1], the 3-state
Potts [2] and Heisenberg [3] anti-ferromagnetic models,
scattering [4] and gauge theories [5], molecular adsorp-
tion [6], black hole physics [7], as well as quantum an-
harmonic [8,9] and double well potentials [9]. Moreover,
a series expansion approach has been applied to systems
with cubic [10] and quartic [11] nonlinearites, which are
directly related to the nonlinear version of the Landau-
Zener problem considered herein.

When external conditions force the diabatic energies of
two interacting quantum states cross, under conditions
of complete adiabaticity the system makes a transition
from one bare energy eigenstate to the other. However,
“complete adiabaticity” applies when the levels cross “in-
ﬁnitely slowly”. The realistic case when only a ﬁnite
time is spent near resonance makes the Landau-Zener
(LZ) problem [12,13], one of the handful of key paradigms
in quantum mechanics. On the other hand, the Gross-
Pitaevskii equation and its variants, nonlinear versions
of standard quantum mechanics, have proven highly suc-
cessful in the theoretical description of alkali-vapor Bose-
Einstein condensate [14]. Nonlinear quantum mechanics
gives up the superposition principle and hence the linear
vector space structure. How much of our intuitive un-
derstanding of quantum mechanics survives becomes an
issue.

The nonlinear version of the LZ problem that is the
focus of this Letter is something we have come across in
our studies of photoassociation [15,16] of a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC). However, the same question will come
up in an attempt to control the scattering length [17] of
an atomic BEC by means of a Feshbach resonance [18],
in second-harmonic generation in nonlinear optics [19],

and generally in ﬁeld theories where the nonlinearity is
of the form ψ†φφ. For concreteness we couch our dis-
cussion in terms of photoassociation, and thus consider
processes in which two atoms and a laser photon join to
make a molecule. It is known from a second-quantized
numerical solution that by sweeping the frequency of the
photoassociating laser, in the adiabatic limit it is possi-
ble to convert an atomic BEC entirely into a molecular
BEC [15]. The question is, what are the nonlinear conse-
quences if the frequency is not swept “inﬁnitely slowly”?
While we actually know of no publication addressing this
question [20,21], we have found that the same applies
also to the semiclassical version of the problem, when
the atomic and molecular condensates are described by
a nonlinear two-state system.

The answer to the above question is outlined as follows.
First the essentials of the linear LZ problem are reviewed,
which serves both as an introduction to the formalism
and a foundation for our series expansion. Turning to
the nonlinear LZ model, we use photoassociation as an
example to review the dressed state picture and illustrate
the physics of adiabatic following. In particular, a pic-
ture in terms of crossing of stationary states still applies
and predicts near-adiabaticity, but the details are qual-
itatively diﬀerent from the case of linear quantum me-
chanics. The ﬁrst-order Heisenberg equations of motion
for the semi-classical atom-molecule amplitudes are then
converted into a third-order diﬀerential equation for the
molecular probability, whereby a perturbative expansion
allows for what amounts to a Green function solution.
All told, we ﬁnd that, while in the linear case the prob-
ability for no transition is an exponential function of the
speed at which the resonance is crossed, at slow sweep
rates of the laser frequency the probability that an atom
does not make a transition to the molecular condensate

is directly proportional to the rate.

The linear LZ problem is speciﬁed by the equations

i ˙β = Ωα + δβ .

Here α and β are the probability amplitudes for the
two bare or diabatic states, Ω is the (real) coupling be-
tween them, and the detuning δ = ξt stands for the
time dependent frequency diﬀerence between the two
states. For any ﬁxed δ the system (1) has two nonde-
generate dressed [22] or adiabatic states [¯α, ¯β] with the
property that the time dependent solution is of the form

Let us next turn to the nonlinear LZ problem. The
equations to solve are a semiclassical approximation
to the photoassociation problem [24], which describes

tuning the photoassociating laser.

For a ﬁxed detuning the system (5) has dressed states

the dressed states of the linear system (1). They are

conventionally referred to as chemical potential. Depend-
ing on the value of the detuning, there may be as many
as three essentially diﬀerent dressed states, along with
a multitude of additional states that can be generated
using the symmetry transformations of Eqs. (5). A triv-
ial state M exists for all detunings.
It has all atoms

Suppose now that the system starts as all atoms at
a large negative detuning, i.e., in state B, and that the
detuning is swept slowly through the resonance. One
expects adiabatic following, so that the system should
stay in state B and eventually turn into state M , into
molecules. This actually is the result both in the corre-
sponding quantum case addressed in Refs. [15,16], and
from our numerical trials with Eqs. (5). However, the
point of resonance where the degree of the transfer of
population is mostly determined occurs where the chem-
ical potentials are equal, at δ/Ω = √2, which is also
precisely where the dressed states merge. The situation
is mathematically much diﬀerent from the linear LZ case.
It is therefore gratifying that we have been able to
carry out an analysis analogous to the LZ case in our
nonlinear system. The (quite involved) technical details
will be reported elsewhere, here we only present the key
idea. Thus, it is possible to combine from Eqs. (5) a
third-order diﬀerential equation for the probability for
molecules, P =

In the limit with λ
1 the LZ transition probability is
small, and so is presumably the solution to Eq. (6). In
Eq. (6) the nonlinear terms, the same ones that make
the right-hand side of Eq. (8), are compared with terms
that are much larger. The nonlinearity makes a “small”
perturbation. We are thus lead to formulate the Ansatz

P (z) = 1

with ε = P ∞LZ may be thought of as the small parameter
in a perturbative expansion.

The calculations make use of what is essentially the
Green’s function for the linear diﬀerential operator acting
on P in Eq. (7). It turns out that a formal expansion of
the type (9) may be found, and for a small enough λ it
even converges to the desired solution of Eq. (6). The

We have solved Eqs. (5) also numerically using several
methods. An example is shown in Fig. 1(a), where we

tion of the running detuning δ = ξt. In this example we
initially ﬁx a negative detuning that lies outside the range
of the graph, and start the system in the corresponding
dressed state B. We then slowly increase the rate of the
sweep of the detuning until it reaches ξ = 0.1 Ω2, still far
to the left of the detuning axis in Fig. 1(a). Upon arrival
to the range plotted in Fig. 1(a), the detuning is swept
at this constant rate ξ, and the occupation probability is
8 of the occupation probability for the dressed
within 10−
state B. At this point adiabaticity still prevails. Es-
√2, though, adiabaticity breaks
pecially around δ/Ω
down. To demonstrate, we show in Fig.1(b) the diﬀerence
between the actual occupation probability of the atomic
state and the prediction from the dressed state B. As is
usual in this type problems, ﬁltering out the oscillations
accurately is a major tour de force. Nonetheless, it is
1 dependence of the residual atomic
easy to see the λ−
probability on the sweep rate numerically.

While these aspects of the computations are somewhat
trivial, computations also provide new insights. The lin-
ear LZ problem is completely symmetric in the two states.
Whether the system starts in state α or β, the probabil-
ity for the transition to the other state is the same. This
cannot hold in the nonlinear case; if α = 0 at some time,
then by Eqs. (5) it will remain so forevermore. Also,
given that the states B and M merge at δ = √2 Ω, one
might expect that there is some preponderance to tran-
sitions to a molecular state. This does not seem to be
the case. In Fig. 1(c) we resort to the same scheme as
in Fig. 1(a), except that we start the system in the su-
perposition with α = β = 1
. The probabilities oscillate
√2
violently around δ = 0, but eventually settle in the neigh-
borhood of half and half again.

In sum, we have studied a nonlinear variant of the
Landau-Zener problem. Though our speciﬁc example
was about photoassociation of a Bose-Einstein conden-
sate, the problem is generic in classical and bosonic ﬁeld
theories with a cubic nonlinearity. While the basic adia-
baticity argument still works, the structure of the adia-
batic or “dressed” states in the nonlinear system is much
diﬀerent from its counterpart in standard linear quantum
mechanics. When the levels cross slowly, the probability
for the failure of adiabaticity turns out to scale linearly
with the rate at which the levels cross, as opposed to the
exponential behavior of the linear problem.

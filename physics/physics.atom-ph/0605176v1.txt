Light propagation in an atomic medium whose coupled electronic levels form a ♦-conﬁguration
exhibits a critical dependence on the input conditions.
In particular, the relative phase of the
input ﬁelds gives rise to interference phenomena in the electronic excitation whose interplay with
relaxation processes determines the stationary state. We integrate numerically the Maxwell-Bloch
equations and observe two metastable behaviors for the relative phase of the propagating ﬁelds
corresponding to two possible interference phenomena. These phenomena are associated to separate
types of response along propagation, minimize dissipation, and are due to atomic coherence. These
behaviors could be studied in gases of isotopes of alkali-earth atoms with zero nuclear spin, and oﬀer
new perspectives in control techniques in quantum electronics.

I.

INTRODUCTION

posed in the context of quantum information process-
ing [18].

Recent experimental progress demonstrates that the
nonlinear optical properties of laser-driven atomic gases
exhibit counter-intuitive features with promising appli-
cations. A peculiarity of these media, in fact, is the pos-
sibility to manipulate their internal and external degrees
of freedom with high degree of control. Few recent and
signiﬁcative examples include the control of the internal
dynamics by means of electromagnetically induced trans-
parency (EIT) in an atomic vapor [1] (used for the gener-
ation of four-wave mixing dynamics [2]) and of controlled
quantum pulses of light [3, 4]. In another experiment, the
interplay of internal and external degrees of freedom in
an ultracold atomic gas by means of recoil-induced res-
onances [5] was used to achieve waveguiding of light [6].
In this perspective, it is important to identify further
possible control parameters on the atomic dynamics for
the manipulation of the non-linear optical response of the
medium.

Recent studies have been focusing onto the dynamics
of light interacting with atoms with coupled electronic
levels in a so-called ’closed-loop’ conﬁguration [7, 8].
In this conﬁguration a set of atomic states is (quasi-)
resonantly coupled by laser ﬁelds so that each state is
connected to any other via two diﬀerent paths of co-
herent photon-scattering.
In these systems, the rela-
tive phase between the transitions critically inﬂuences
dynamics [7] and steady states [8, 9, 10]. Applica-
tions of closed-loop conﬁgurations to nonlinear optics
have featured double-Λ systems where two stable or
metastable states are -each- coupled to two common ex-
cited states. A rich variety of nonlinear optical phenom-
ena has been predicted [9, 11, 12] and experimentally ob-
served [2, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. In [17], in particular, it has
been shown experimentally that the properties of closed-
loop conﬁgurations can be used to correlate electromag-
netic ﬁelds with carrier frequency diﬀerences beyond the
GHz regime. Moreover, coherent control based on the
relative phase in closed-loop conﬁguration has been pro-

FIG. 1: Electronic transitions of the ♦-conﬁguration. Each
transition |ii → |ji is resonantly driven by a laser ﬁeld at fre-
quency νij . Here, |gi is the ground state, |1i and |2i the in-
termediate states, which decay into the ground state at rates
γ1g and γ2g, respectively, and |ei the excited state, which
decays with rates γe1 and γe2 into the corresponding inter-
mediate states. Each pair of levels is coupled by two paths
of excitation, hence the dynamics depends critically on the
relative phase between the paths. The coherent dynamics of
this conﬁguration is equivalent to the double-Λ scheme, while
relevant diﬀerences with it originates from radiative decay.

In this work we investigate the phase-dependent dy-
namics of light propagation in a medium of atoms whose
electronic levels are driven in a closed-loop conﬁguration,
denoted by the ♦ (diamond) scheme and sketched in
Fig. 1. This conﬁguration consists of four driven tran-
sitions where one ground state is coupled in a V-type
structure to two intermediate states, which are in turn
coupled to a common excited state in a Λ-type structure.
It can be encountered, for instance, in (suitably driven)
isotopes of alkali-earth atoms with zero nuclear spin [19].
Although the coherent dynamics of ♦ schemes is equiv-
alent to that of double-Λ systems [7], the steady states
of the two systems exhibit relevant diﬀerences due to the
diﬀerent relaxation processes [9, 10].

The dynamics of light propagation in a medium of ♦-
atoms is studied by integrating numerically the Maxwell-
Bloch equations. We ﬁnd that, depending on the in-
put ﬁeld parameters, the polarization along the medium
can be drastically modiﬁed. The propagation dynam-
ics may exhibit two meta-stable values of the relative
phase, namely the values 0 and π, corresponding to a
semi-transparent and to an opaque medium, respectively.
For diﬀerent values of the initial phase, light propagation
along the medium tends to one of these two values, de-
pending on the input values of the driving amplitudes.
These two types of metastable response are supported
by the formation of atomic coherences leading to a min-
imization of dissipation by depleting the population of
one or more atomic states. This metastable behavior is
novel, to our knowledge, and oﬀers promising perspec-
tives in control techniques in quantum electronics.

The article is organized as follows. In Sec. II the model
is introduced and discussed. In Sec. III the results for the
dynamics of light propagation are reported and discussed
in some parameter regimes. Conclusions and outlooks
are reported in Sec. IV. The appendices present in de-
tail equations and calculations at the basis of the model
derived in Sec. II.

II. THE MODEL

We consider a classical ﬁeld propagating in a dilute
atomic gas along the positive z-direction. The ﬁeld is
composed by four optical frequencies ν1g, ν2g, νe1 and
νe2, its complex amplitude is a function of time t and
position z of the form

E(z, t) =

Eij (z, t)eije

−i(νij t−kij z+φij (z,t)) + c.c.,

1
2 Xi,j

(1)
where we have denoted by kij and eij the wave vector
and polarization of the frequency component νij. The
input ﬁeld enters the medium at z = 0, and the eﬀect of
coupling to the medium is accounted for in the z depen-
dence of the amplitude Eij(z, t) and phase φij (z, t) whose
variations in position and time are slow with respect to
the wavelengths λij = 2π/kij and the oscillation periods
T = 2π/νij, respectively. The atomic gas is very dilute
and we can assume that the atoms interact with the ﬁelds
individually. In particular, each ﬁeld component at fre-
quency νij drives (quasi-) resonantly with the electronic
transition |ii → |ji of the atoms in the medium, such
that the atomic levels are coupled in a ♦-shaped conﬁg-
uration.

The relevant atomic transitions and the coupling due
to the lasers are displayed in Fig. 1. Here, |gi is the
ground state, coupled by dipole transitions to the in-
termediate states |1i, |2i at the dipole moments d1g =
h1|d|gi, d2g = h2|d|gi, frequencies ω1, ω2, and decay
rates γ1g and γ2g, respectively, to state |gi. The interme-
diate states are also coupled to the excited state |ei, at

2

frequency ωe with respect to the state |gi, by the dipole
transitions de1 = he|d|1i, de2 = he|d|2i. The excited
state |ei decays into states |1i and |2i at rates γe1 and
γe2, respectively. A similar conﬁguration of levels can
be found in isotopes of alkali atoms with zero nuclear
spin [19]. The dipole operator for the reduced Hilbert
space of the electronic states of the atom is given by

ˆd =

Xj=1,2

(dej|jihe| + djg|gihj|) + H.c.

Below we introduce the equations for ﬁeld propagation
and atomic dynamics, and make some preliminary con-
siderations about the system.

A. Equations for ﬁeld propagation

We denote by P(z, t) the macroscopic polarization

P(z, t) = n Tr{ˆdσ(z; t)}

(2)

where ˆd is the dipole operator, n is the density of the
medium, which we assume to be zero for z < 0 and uni-
form for z > 0, and σ(z, t) is the atomic density matrix at
time t and position z, which has been obtained by trac-
ing out the other external degrees of freedom. Details of
the underlying assumptions at the basis of Eq. (2) are
discussed in Appendix A.

We decompose polarization P(z, t) into slowly- and

fast-varying components, namely

P(z, t) =

Pij (z, t)eije

−i(νij t−kij z+φij (z,t)) + c.c.,

1
2 Xi,j

(3)
whereby the complex amplitudes Pij and the phases φij
vary slowly as a function of position and time, and we
consider the parameter regime where the driving ﬁelds
are suﬃciently weak, so that the generation of higher-
order harmonics can be neglected. By comparison of
Eqs. (2) and (3), the amplitudes Pij can be expressed
in terms of the elements of the density matrix σ,

Pij = 2nDijσij ei(νij t−kij z+χij )

(4)

where σij = hi|σ|ji and we have used eij · dji = Dij e−iθij ,
thereby separating the complex amplitudes Pij into mod-
ulus and phase. Here, the term Dij is real, θij are the
dipole phases (θij = −θji), and

χij (z, t) = φij (z, t) − θij

(5)

is the sum of the slowly-varying ﬁeld phases φij (z, t) and
the dipole phases θij .

Using deﬁnitions (1) and (3) and applying a coarse-
grained description in time and space, the Maxwell equa-
tions simplify to a set of propagation equations for each

of the slowly-varying components of the laser and polar-
ization ﬁelds [20]

which are deﬁned for z > 0. Here, each amplitude Eij

We rescale the propagation equations using the di-
mensionless length ξ = κ1gz and dimensionless time
τ = c κ1gt, where κ1g is the absorption coeﬃcient

such that 1/κ1g determines the characteristic length at
which light penetrates a medium of dipoles at density n,

B. Atomic dynamics

The time evolution of the density matrix σ(z, t) for the
atomic internal degrees of freedom at position z > 0 is
governed by the master equation

˙σ =

1
i~ [H(z, t), σ] + Lσ.

(14)

where z is a classical variable. Equation (14) is obtained
by tracing out the degrees of freedom of momentum and

3

of position in the transverse plane, in the limit in which
the medium is homogeneously broadened and the atoms
are suﬃciently hot and dilute such that their external
degrees of freedom can be treated classically. Details of
the assumptions at the basis of Eq. (14) are reported in
Appendix A. Here the Hamiltonian

(cid:17)
describes the coherent dynamics of the internal degrees
of freedom, and it depends on z through the (real-valued)
Rabi frequency, Eq. (10), and through the corresponding
phase of ﬁeld and dipole.

The states |1i, |2i, |ei are unstable and decay radia-
tively with rates γ1g, γ2g, γe, respectively. The relaxation
processes are described by

Lσ =

where γe1+γe2 = γe. In this paper we assume γej = γe/2.
We remark that in Eq. (16) the recoil due to spontaneous
emission is neglected since the motion is considered clas-
sical. Note that the transitions |gi → |ji (j = 1, 2) are
saturated when Ωjg ≥ γjg. Correspondingly, the upper
transitions |ji → |ei are saturated when Ωej ≥ γe + γjg.
For later convenience, we introduce

˜Gej =

Gej
1 + γe/γjg

,

which explicitly shows the scalings of the upper ﬁelds
amplitudes with the corresponding dissipation rates.

C. The relative phase

In the so-called closed-loop conﬁgurations, like in the
♦ scheme, transitions between each pair of electronic lev-
els are characterized by -at least- two excitation paths,
involving diﬀerent intermediate atomic levels [8, 11]. In
the ♦ scheme the relative phase

∆χ(z, t) = χe1(z, t)+χ1g(z, t)−χe2(z, t)−χ2g(z, t) (17)

with χij deﬁned in Eq. (5), critically determines the so-
lution of the master equation, and hence atomic response
to propagation. The role of the relative phase (17) in the
atomic response is better unveiled by moving to a suit-
able reference frame for the atomic evolution, which is
deﬁned when all amplitudes Eij are nonzero. We denote

by ρ the density matrix in this reference frame, obeying
the master equation

for j = 1, 2 and

∆1 = ω1 − ν1g
∆2 = ω2 − ν2g
∆e = ωe − νe1 − ν1g.

The Hamiltonian (19) exhibits an explicit dependence on
the phase

Θ(z, t) = ∆ν t − ∆k z − ∆θ + ∆φ(z, t).

(23)

where

∆ν = νe1 + ν1g − ν2g − νe2
∆k = ke1 + k1g − k2g − ke2
∆θ = θe1 + θ1g − θ2g − θe2.

The quantity ∆ν is the four-photon detuning of the laser
frequencies, ∆k is the wave-vector mismatch and ∆θ is
the relative dipole phase. In [9, 10] it has been discussed
how Θ aﬀects the dynamics of the atom. In particular,
when ∆ν = 0 a steady state exists and it is critically de-
termined by the value of Θ, entering master equation (18)
through the Hamiltonian (19). In the remainder of this
article we assume

∆ν = 0, ∆k = 0,

namely the atoms are driven at four-photon resonance
and by copropagating laser ﬁelds, such that the wave vec-
tor mismatch is negligible. Hence, the phase Θ depends
solely on the relative dipole phase, which is constant,
and on the relative phase of the propagating ﬁelds, which
evolves according to the coupled Eqs. (11) and (12).

We use relations ρg1 = pg1, ρg2 = pg2, ρe1 = pe1, and

pe2 = ρe2exp (iΘ) ,

which connect the elements of the density matrix ρ in the
new reference frame with the elements pij. Substituting
into Eqs. (11)-(12), we ﬁnd

We remark that the value of the terms ρij depends on
the amplitudes of the ﬁelds and on the value of the phase
Θ, as it is visible from Eq. (18) and (19). The propaga-
tion dynamics now consist in solving the coupled equa-
tion (18) and Eqs. (27)-(32). The optical Bloch equations
for the density matrix ρ are presented in Appendix B.

In general,

the density matrix elements entering
Eqs. (27)-(32) are time dependent, i.e., ρ = ρ(τ ). In this
paper we consider the case of suﬃciently long laser pulses,
such that the characteristic time of change of amplitude
and phase of the ﬁelds and the interaction time between
light and atoms exceed the time scale in which the atom
reaches the internal steady state.
In this regime, we
can neglect transient eﬀects, and the density matrix ele-
ments entering Eq. (27)-(32) are the stationary solutions
of Eq. (18) satisfying ∂ρ/∂t = 0. This assumption allows
us to neglect the time derivative in Eqs. (27)-(32), hence
taking ξ′ ≈ ξ.

III. LIGHT PROPAGATION IN THE ♦-MEDIUM

In this section we study light propagation in a medium
of ♦-atoms by solving numerically the Maxwell-Bloch
Equations, Eqs. (18) and (27)-(32). We restrict ourselves
to some parameter regimes, with the purpose of singling
out the role played by the phase and the radiative de-
cay processes in the dynamics. In particular, we consider
the situation where each atomic transition is driven at
resonance, namely

∆i = 0,

for i = 1, 2, e. Moreover, we restrict to the regime where
the ﬁelds are initially driving the corresponding transi-
tions at saturation. This latter assumption is important
to guarantee a ﬁnite occupation of the excited state |ei,
and thus to highlight the dependence of the dynamics on
the relative phase Θ.

During the propagation dynamics, it may occur that
one of the ﬁeld amplitudes vanishes in just one point
of the propagation variable ξ′. When this happens, the
relative phase Θ is not deﬁned and its value must be reset

manually to continue the propagation when integrating
the ﬁeld equations in amplitude and phase (see Eqs. (27)-
(32)). In such cases the value of the chosen phase depends
on the ﬁeld amplitude that vanishes. The correctness of
this procedure has been checked by comparing the results
with those obtained by integrating the ﬁeld equations
for the real and imaginary parts of the complex ﬁelds
amplitudes.

A. Symmetric drives

We consider the parameter regime such that the laser
amplitudes driving the upper (lower) transitions are ini-
tially equal, namely

Ge1(0) = Ge2(0) = Ge
G1g(0) = G2g(0) = Gg.

(33)
(34)

For these input amplitudes the components of the po-
larizations entering the equations for the ﬁeld phases,
Eqs. (28), (30) and (32), and determining the evolution
of the phase along the medium, vanish for Θ = ℓπ, with
ℓ being an integer [10]. Hence, if at the input

then

Θ(ξ = 0) = ℓπ,

∂Θ
∂ξ

= 0

(35)

(36)

and the relative phase remains constant during propaga-
tion along the medium. On the other hand, the com-
ponents of the polarization in the equations for the ﬁeld
amplitude, determining how energy is dissipated along
the medium, depend critically on whether ℓ in Eq. (35)
is even or odd. Below we discuss these two cases in detail
and comment on the phase stability during propagation.

1. Light propagation for Θ(0) = π

For ℓ odd, say Θ(0) = π, the polarizations of the tran-
sitions between the intermediate and the upper states
identically vanish, i.e., ρe1 = ρe2 = 0 [10]. Therefore,
the atoms are perfectly decoupled from the upper ﬁelds
independently of their intensity. This is an interference
eﬀect arising from the fact that the upper transitions
are driven in opposition of phase with respect to the
lower transitions. As a consequence the excited state
is not populated. It can be shown that in this regime the
global atomic dynamics can be mapped onto the ones of
two-level transitions where the ground state is coupled to
a coherence between the intermediate states, that is an
EIT-coherence for the upper ﬁelds [7, 10]. Correspond-
ingly, the dynamics of light propagation of the lower ﬁelds
is expected to be the one encountered in a medium of V-
atoms.

5

Figure 2(a) displays the propagation dynamics along
the medium when Θ(0) = π and Gij (0) = G0. Here,
one sees that the upper ﬁelds propagate through the
medium as if it were transparent, keeping a constant
value Gej = G0. The amplitudes of the lower ﬁelds decay
in the same way, i.e., G1g(ξ) = G2g(ξ). Figure 2(b) dis-
plays the corresponding populations of the electronic lev-
els along the medium. The electronic level |ei remains de-
pleted and the intermediate states |1i and |2i are equally
occupied as a function of ξ, corresponding to the fact
that G1g(ξ) = G2g(ξ) along the medium. The value of
ground and intermediate state populations remains con-
stant until about ξ ∼ 200 till the ﬁelds Gjg(ξ) saturate
the respective transitions, and they undergo a fast change
when the lower ﬁeld amplitudes drive the lower transi-
tions below saturation so that only the ground state is
appreciably occupied. Note that these dynamics are in-
dependent of the value of Ge1, Ge2, as these ﬁelds remain
decoupled from the atoms.

FIG. 2: (color online) (a) Rescaled ﬁeld amplitudes Gg and ˜Ge
as a function of the propagation length ξ for Gg(0) = ˜Ge(0) =
10 and Θ(0) = π. The behaviour is independent of the value
of γe and of ˜Ge, and the upper ﬁelds propagate unperturbed
through the medium. (b) Populations of the electronic levels
Πi = hi|ρ|ii as a function of the propagation length. The
excited state |ei remains depleted along the medium.

The dynamics described in Fig. 2 is also apparent when
we inspect the propagation equations for Θ(0) = π. Set-
ting Ge1(0) = Ge2(0) = Ge and G1g(0) = G2g(0) = Gg,
we obtain, together with Eq. (36), the equations for the

(38)

where Eq. (38) vanishes since Im{ρij(Θ = π)} = 0.
Therefore, the relative phase Θ and the upper ﬁeld ampli-
tudes Ge are constant along the medium and the medium
is transparent to the upper ﬁelds. In particular, the prop-
agation of the amplitudes Gg depends only on the value of
Gg itself, and Eq. (37) has the same form of the equations
of an electric ﬁeld propagating in a medium of resonant
dipoles. Numerical investigations show that this dynam-
ics at Θ = π is robust against phase and amplitudes
ﬂuctuations, showing that this type of response of the
medium is a metastable conﬁguration. It should be re-
marked that this behavior is transient, since the medium
dissipates the lower ﬁelds until the atoms are all found in
the ground state well inside the medium. Nevertheless,
even when the intermediate states are appreciably occu-
pied, the upper ﬁelds propagate through the medium as
if it were transparent.

2. Light propagation for Θ(0) = 0

When Θ = 0, two photon processes are characterized
by paths of excitations which can interfere constructively.
In this regime, atomic coherences between either the in-
termediates states or the ground and excited states may
form, and correspondingly the imaginary part of the po-
larizations may become very small, thus reducing dis-
sipation. The appearance of this dynamics is critically
determined by the ratio between the decay rate of the
intermediate states and that of the excited state, namely
on the parameter

α =

γe
γ1g + γ2g

.

(39)

In [10] we showed that when this ratio is apprecia-
bly diﬀerent from unity and Θ = 0, metastable EIT-
coherences [1] characterize the atomic steady state. We
now investigate how light propagates for diﬀerent values
of α when the phase is initially set to the value Θ(0) = 0.

We ﬁrst consider the propagation equations setting ini-
tially Θ(0) = 0, ˜Ge1(0) = ˜Ge2(0) = ˜Ge(0) and G1g(0) =
G2g(0) = Gg(0). Figure 3 displays the propagation dy-
namics along the medium for diﬀerent values of the ratio
α. For α ≫ 1 and α ≪ 1 the amplitudes decay slowly
as a function of ξ, as expected from the formation of
In [10] it has been shown that these

coherences may originate population inversion at steady
state. In particular, for α ≪ 1 and Θ = 0 the atom can
exhibit population inversion between the excited and the

intermediate states at the steady state for some param-
eter regimes. Similarly, for α ≫ 1 population inversion
at steady state was observed between the intermediate
and the ground states. Figure 4 show light propagation,
when the initial conditions over the ﬁelds give population
inversion at steady state. Here, one sees that population
inversion is found also along the absorbing medium and
it gradually decreases since the atomic coherences are
metastable.

In the simulations of Figures 3 and 4, the lower (up-
per) ﬁeld amplitudes remain equal to one another during

Equations (40) and (41) describe the dissipative propa-

decay steadily along the medium. Correspondingly, the
behavior of the population is shown in Fig. 5(d). Here,
one sees that when the Rabi frequency is larger than
the saturation value, the population of the ground and
intermediate states are diﬀerent from zero and constant,
while the excited state is nearly depleted. When the
lower ﬁeld amplitudes are damped below saturation, the
ground state population increases while the intermediate
states populations accordingly vanish.

Case α = 100.

In Fig. 5(a) the decay of the lower
ﬁeld amplitudes Gg diﬀer strikingly from the behavior
usually encountered in a medium of dipoles. Moreover,
the upper ﬁeld amplitudes Ge remain almost constant
along the medium. Further insight into the dynamics
can be gained by analyzing the corresponding atomic
state populations. In Fig. 5(b) the excited state is nearly
depleted, the intermediate states are initially as popu-
lated as the ground state, and their population decrease
gradually during propagation. From further analysis one
can infer that atomic coherence between states |1i and
|2i characterizes the propagation dynamics of the upper
ﬁelds which thus decouple from the excited state |ei due
to destructive interference in a way similar to the re-
sponse of EIT-media. In this case, this atomic coherence
is unstable due to decay of the intermediate states. It
is established through the medium by the action of the
lower ﬁelds that pump atoms into the upper states as long
as they drive the lower transitions well above saturation,
and by the faster decay of the excited state capable to
create transient coherences. The formation of these co-
herences have been observed in the transient dynamics
of pulse propagation in a medium of ♦-atoms [13]. Dif-
ferently from the case discussed in Fig. 4, the parameter
regime here does not support population inversion, and
the intermediate states are initially almost as populated
as the ground state.

amplitudes,
initially equal to each other, become dif-
ferent during propagation so that after a certain prop-
agation length one increases, ˜Ge1, while the other, ˜Ge2,
decreases until it vanishes. At this point, the relative
phase Θ jumps from zero to π, ˜Ge2 starts to increase
again while ˜Ge1 keeps decreasing till they reach almost
the same value. After this transient, the ﬁeld amplitudes
of the excited states maintain a constant value across the
medium. Correspondingly, during and after this tran-
sient, the excited state population in Fig. 5(f) decreases
until it reaches zero. This remarkable behavior hints to
an instability of the phase value Θ = 0, which seems to be
triggered here by numerical ﬂuctuations of the values of
the upper ﬁeld amplitudes. This conjecture is supported
by the numerical analysis shown in Fig. 6 and where the
initial values of the upper ﬁeld amplitudes vary of (a)
one part over 10−16, (b) one part over 10−12 and (c)
one part over 10−8. As the initial discrepancy increases,
this behavior appears at earlier locations in the medium.
Investigations on populations and phases show that the

dependence on the amplitudes and the ratio α of the de-
cay constants. Here, one can see that for diﬀerent values
of α the absorption lengths can vary by orders of mag-
nitude. Limit cases are found when α → 0 , i.e. when
the excited state is stable, and α → ∞, i.e. when the
intermediate states are stable. In these cases, the right
hand sides of Eqs. (40) and (41) vanish, damping is ab-
sent, and light propagates through the medium as if it
was transparent [21].

In the cases discussed so far, energy is exchanged be-
tween upper and lower ﬁelds until the lower ﬁelds am-
plitudes are damped below saturation. Then, the up-
per ﬁelds decouple as the population of the intermediate
states is negligible. In order to study the long term dy-
namics of propagation, we now focus onto the regime
where the lower transitions are driven very well above
saturation and where we expect diﬀerent length scales
for the propagation of the upper and lower ﬁelds.

Figure 5 displays propagation when initially Gg(0) =
10 and ˜Ge(0) = 1, for diﬀerent values of α. We discuss
case by case, starting from the case of α = 1 where upper
and lower transitions dissipate at comparable rates. The
dynamics observed in the α = 1 case clearly separates
the regimes corresponding to α = 0.01 and α = 100.

Case α = 1. In Fig. 5(c) the amplitudes of the ﬁelds

case α = 1, and (e) and (f) to the case α = 0.01.

unbalance between the upper ﬁeld amplitudes induces a
depletion of the excited state until the vanishing of one
of the upper amplitudes forces a phase jump to the value
Θ = π and the system settles to the situation where the
upper ﬁelds decouple from the atom. After the phase
jump, the upper ﬁeld amplitudes tend to recover an equal
value, but they end to decouple from the atom once the
lower ﬁeld amplitudes have vanished.

The phase Θ = 0 is hence unstable and its instabil-
ity is driven by small ﬂuctuations in the diﬀerence of the
initial ﬁeld amplitudes. Such instability, however, moves
to further propagation lengths as α increases, i.e. when
the decay rate of the excited state increases. This case is
investigated in Fig. 7, where one can see that the symme-
try breaking is progressively delayed and ﬁnally moves to
distances where all ﬁelds have been completely absorbed
by the medium, as the value of α varies from 0.001 to 0.1
and for the same initial diﬀerence between the two upper
ﬁeld values of one part over 10−8.

The behavior described in Fig. 7 is due to the long term
occupation of the excited state. In particular, for Θ = 0
and α ≪ 1 the excited state is very stable and a long
term coherence is built between the ground and excited
states. Such coherence is similar to that encountered in
a cascade, Ξ, conﬁguration [22] and indeed for Θ = 0 and
symmetric drives the ♦-level system can be mapped onto
a Ξ scheme [7, 10]. However, such dynamics is unstable
since small diﬀerences of the upper ﬁeld amplitudes lead
to a phase jump and to the depletion of the excited state.
In the new conﬁguration the upper ﬁelds decouple from
the intermediate states by means of a diﬀerent atomic
coherence eﬀect. In fact in the regime corresponding to
Θ = π, the intermediate levels get appreciably occupied

while the dynamics of propagation becomes unaﬀected
by the upper ﬁelds. In this regime, the dynamics of the
♦-level system can be mapped onto the one of a V-level
scheme [10]. This behavior may appear contradictory
since the upper ﬁelds are now expected to populate the
excited state by depleting the intermediate ones. How-
ever, for Θ = π, CPT takes place in the upper Λ of the ♦
system, the intermediate states become decoupled from
the excited state and the upper ﬁelds are not absorbed.
We then explain the phase jump from Θ = 0 to Θ = π
as the tendency for the system to minimize the rate of
dissipation. This behavior is reminiscent of the dynamics
observed in Four-Wave Mixing experiments where inter-
ference eﬀects are generated in order to minimize spon-
taneous emission [23].

3. Light propagation for a generic initial phase

In this section we discuss light propagation for input
parameters (33) and (34) and phase Θ 6= ℓπ. In particu-
lar, we choose Θ(0) = π/2, as for the numerical studies
made for other values of the phase Θ 6= ℓπ the dynamics
does not change substantially, so that this case can be
considered exemplary.

Figures 8 and 9 display the amplitude and the relative
phase of the propagating ﬁelds for α = 0.01, 100. Al-
though the ﬁeld amplitudes are clearly damped for all
values of α, the mechanism of radiation dissipation de-
pends on α and on the initial strengths of the ﬁeld ampli-
tudes. We can identify two behaviors of the dynamics of
propagation depending on how strongly the lower ﬁelds
saturate the corresponding transitions.

In Figure 8 the saturation parameters in the upper
transition is larger or equal to the saturation parameters
in the lower transitions. Here, we observe that the phase
of the ﬁeld tends to the zero value. Before this value is
reached, radiation is damped at a fast rate. Once the
value Θ = 0 is reached, the slope of the lower-amplitude
curves changes abruptly and decays more slowly. This
sudden change in the behavior occurs at a propagation
length determined by the typical absorption length of
the fast decaying transition. The system tends to con-
ﬁgurations corresponding to Θ = 0, thereby switching
to an EIT-like response. A similar kind of behavior is
also observed in a medium of the Double-Λ atoms where
EIT-coherences are established between the two stable

states [9]. In the ♦ conﬁguration, the atomic coherences
that characterize the dynamics when the phase reaches
the value Θ = 0 are also EIT-like, whereby due to the co-
herence instability the interference phenomenon is tran-
sient [14]. Depending on the value of α, coherences are
established either between the intermediate states, like
in a Λ conﬁguration, or between the ground and excited
states, like in a Ξ conﬁguration. This latter case is en-
countered for α = 0.01, and leads to population inversion
between the excited and the intermediate states along the
medium, see Fig. 8(f), whereby the population of the in-
termediate states gets very small.

Figure 9 displays the situation, when the lower tran-
sitions are driven well above saturation, and the corre-
sponding saturation parameter is larger than the satu-
ration parameter for the upper ﬁelds. Here, the phase

slowly tends to the value π where the upper transitions
are decoupled from the ﬁelds. In this case, the typical
propagation length at which the π value of the phase is
reached is larger than in the previous cases. Nonetheless,
the tendency of the medium is to reach the situation in
which the upper ﬁelds are decoupled. This kind of be-
havior corresponds to the creation of a coherence between
the intermediate states which is decoupled from the up-
per ﬁelds since it is out of phase with respect to these
drives. The onset of this dynamics depends critically on
the value of Gg. The ﬁeld amplitudes must well saturate
the lower transitions with respect to Ge so to populate
the intermediate states on a time scale shorter than their
decay rate, but long enough for incoherent decay of the
upper state to take place. This behavior is in agreement
with the observation of the instability of the phase Θ = 0
when the lower transitions are driven well above satura-
tion, showing that for this parameter regime the value
Θ = π is the stable one.

B. Four-wave mixing

In this section we discuss propagation when one ﬁeld
is initially very weak while the other three transitions are
driven at saturation. Figures 10 and 11 display the ﬁelds
propagation when the upper ﬁeld amplitude Ge2 is very
small and the phase is initially set to the value Θ(0) =
π/2. In both cases one observes ampliﬁcation of the weak
ﬁeld.
In the case displayed in Fig. 10 ampliﬁcation is
accompanied by the asymptotic approach to the value
Θ = π while in the case of Fig. 11 to the value Θ = 0.
Let us now discuss these two behaviors in detail.

The case displayed in Fig. 10 is characterized by α =
0.1, and thus by a slowly decaying upper state, while
the initial ﬁeld amplitudes Gg1, Gg2, and ˜Ge1 are set well
above their saturation values. In Fig. 10(a) the ﬁeld Ge2 is
initially ampliﬁed until both the upper ﬁelds Ge1 and Ge2
reach a constant value along the medium. During the
transient dynamics, the upper ﬁeld amplitude Ge1 and
the lower ﬁeld Gg2 decrease while the lower ﬁeld ampli-
tude Gg1 displays a slight increase around the transient
end. This behavior is accompanied by a redistribution
of population between the ground and the intermediate
states while the excited state is depleted, see Fig. 10(c).
Accordingly to Fig. 10(b), one observes that the phase
reaches the value Θ = π. Hence, the ﬁeld Ge2 is ampliﬁed
until the upper state is depleted because of interference
between the upper ﬁelds. From this point further the
phase Θ = π is stable, until the lower ﬁeld amplitudes go
below saturation. The jump of the phase to the value 0
is an artifact due to all atoms being in the ground state.
In the case displayed in Fig. 11 the excited state is
metastable and α = 0.01. The initial ﬁeld amplitudes
Gg1, Gg2, and ˜Ge1 are set to the saturation value.
In
Fig. 11(a) the ﬁeld Ge2 is ampliﬁed while the upper ﬁeld
amplitude Ge1 and both lower ﬁeld amplitudes Gg1 and

reaches the value Θ = π, see Fig. 11(b), and undergoes a
jump to the value Θ = 0 when Gg2 vanishes. After this
point the behavior changes and Gg2 ﬁrst increases and
then decays slowly as a function of ξ in a way similar to
Gg1, while the upper ﬁeld amplitudes remain constant.
The ﬁnal conﬁguration supports a coherence between the
excited and the ground state in a way similar to a cas-
cade system. In particular, due to destructive interfer-
ence, the ﬁelds are only weakly coupled to the transitions
and the medium is semitransparent. This is also visible
in Fig. 11(c) where we show that the population is redis-
tributed between the ground and the excited states while
the intermediate states are depleted. In this regime the
medium is characterized by population inversion between
the excited and the intermediate states.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated numerically light propagation in
a medium of atoms whose electronic levels are resonantly
driven by lasers in a ♦ conﬁguration. Propagation is crit-
ically aﬀected by the initial conditions of the input ﬁelds
and show the tendency to reach conﬁgurations which
minimize dissipation. A peculiar role is played by the
relative phase Θ between the ﬁelds. In fact, it exhibits
two ﬁxed points, Θ = 0 and Θ = π, whose stability dur-
ing propagation depends on the ﬁeld amplitudes and on
the ratio α between the rates of dissipation of excited
and intermediate states. A generic input phase evolves,
in general, to one of these values depending on the input
amplitudes and α.

These two metastable responses are supported by two
diﬀerent types of atomic coherences. The response of the
medium, corresponding to the phase Θ = 0, is character-
ized by the formation of metastable atomic coherences
typical of EIT-media. Similar behaviors have been ob-
served for instance in [13, 14] and are analogous to the
response predicted for light propagation in double-Λ me-
dia [9].

The response of the medium for the phase Θ = π is
supported by a diﬀerent type of interference which leads
to a depletion of the upper state and to a perfect decou-
pling of the upper ﬁelds from the atom. For this value
of the phase, the medium acts as if the atomic conﬁgura-
tion were V -level scheme. In particular, this value of the
phase appears to be the preferred value for the ♦ medium
when the lower transitions are driven well above satura-
tion. This behavior is novel to our knowledge and it is
reminiscent of the phenomenon of suppression of sponta-
neous emission observed in four-wave mixing studies in
atomic gases [23].

In general, the system oﬀers a rich dynamics and sev-
eral novel features due to atomic coherence which oﬀer
new perspectives in control techniques in quantum elec-
tronics. These could be studied in atomic gases where the
ground state has no hyperﬁne multiplet, like e.g. alkali-
earth isotopes which are currently investigated for atomic

clocks [19].

In the future we will extend our analysis to the case
in which the transitions are not resonantly driven and
we will address the asymptotic behavior of the system
following the lines of recent works [24, 25].

Assuming that that atomic gas has been Doppler cooled,
so that line broadening is homogeneous, the kinetic en-
ergy can be neglected in evaluating the atomic response
to light. By integrating over p and x, y we hence obtain
dpdxdyw(x, p)σ(x, p), and
Eq. (14), whereby σ(z) =
polarization as in Eq. (2).

[21] This behavior may not seem obvious for α → ∞, but
it becomes evident after rescaling the ﬁeld amplitudes,
Eq. (9), with the linewidth γe and then letting γjg → 0.

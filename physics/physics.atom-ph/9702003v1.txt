Abstract.
In this paper we compare the results of our adiabatic theory (Gribakin
and Kuchiev, Phys. Rev. A, submitted for publication) with other theoretical and
experimental results, mostly for halogen negative ions. The theory is based on
the Keldysh approach.
It shows that the multiphoton detachment rates and the
corresponding n-photon detachment cross sections depend only on the asymptotic
Ar−1e−κr. The
parameters A and κ of the bound state radial wave function R(r)
dependence on κ is very strong. This is the main reason for the disagreement with
some previous calculations, which employ bound state wave functions with incorrect
In a number of cases our theoretical results produces best
asymptotic κ values.

In this paper we use the theory of multiphoton detachment from negative ions
developed in our previous work (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1996) to calculate n-photon
detachment cross sections and excess photon detachment (EPD) spectra for some
negative ions and frequencies, which have been explored experimentally.

It has been shown that for a linearly polarized light the diﬀerential n-photon

detachment cross section for the electron in the initial state lm is

distribution. This eﬀect is due to interference between the two contributions to the
photodetachment amplitude produced at the moments of time when the ﬁeld strength
reaches its maximum (there are two such instants in every period of the ﬁeld). The
phase Ξ varies with the ejection angle of the photoelectron in between
Ξ0 and Ξ0,
where Ξ0 = (2n + 1) tan−1(p/κ) + pκ/ω, and can be quite large, even for the lowest-

odd n + l, respectively. This depends on whether the lowest photoelectron partial wave

The theory which has lead to equations (1) and (4) shows that the detachment
process takes place when the electron is far from the atomic core, at distances estimated
κ−1√2n (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1996). This is why the probabilities can be
as r
expressed in terms of the asymptotic parameters A and κ of the bound-state wave
function. All corrections due to electron-atom scattering or electron correlations, e.g.,
the electron-atom polarizational interaction, are expected to be suppressed by some
powers of n.

In what follows we use equations (4) and (5) to calculate the cross section for
those negative ions and photon frequencies where some experimental data are available.
Parameters of the electron bound state wave functions in these negative ions are listed
in table 1. Note that if after the detachment the neutral atom is left in its ground state,
then κ is determined by the corresponding electron aﬃnity Ea (Hotop and Lineberger
1985), κ = √2Ea, and if the atom in the ﬁnal state is excited (e.g., to the upper ﬁne-
2(Ea + ∆), where ∆ is the energy of the atomic excitation
structure level), then κ =
(Radtsig and Smirnov 1986). In both cases we are dealing with the detachment of the
valence electron, hence, the same value of A is used. In contrast with κ, the values of
A for most ions are known only to within 10 % or worse. In spite of the fact that the
present theory is strictly valid for large n, it will be applied to n as low as 2, where, we
believe, it gives reasonable answers.

aValues taken from Radtsig and Smirnov (1986) for O−, Cu−, Ag−, and Au−, and
from Smirnov and Nikitin (1988) for F−, Cl−, Br−, and I−.
bThis value gives correct cross sections for oxygen, when the ﬁne-structure is neglected.

Figure 2(a) presents a comparison of the 2-photon detachment cross sections for
O−, Cu−, Ag− and Au− measured by Stapelfeldt et al (1991a, 1991b) at ω = 1.165
eV, with our values, and the theoretical result of Robinson and Geltman (1967) for
O−.
In the latter calculation the single-electron wave functions were calculated in
a model polarization potential chosen to reproduce the correct value of the electron
aﬃnity. Figure 2(b) shows the 3-photon cross sections for F−, Br− and I−, as measured
by Blondel et al (1989) and Kwon et al (1989) (F− only), together with the results
of our calculations and those of Crance (1988), where the Hartree-Fock (HF) wave

5

functions and plane waves were used to describe the initial and the ﬁnal state of the
electron, respectively. Two features are most obvious. First, our theoretical values are
considerably higher than the experimental ones, and second, there is a much better
agreement between the relative cross sections, as given by the theory and experiment.
There is also a reasonable agreement between the two calculations for O−, Br− and I−.
The large disagreement between our value for F− and that of Crance 1988 is, as
discussed in Gribakin and Kuchiev (1996), due to the incorrect behaviour of the HF
bound state wave function, which falls oﬀ much faster than the true one (the HF value
of κ for F− is 0.6, vs the true κ = 0.5). Note that among the halogen negative ions this
discrepancy is the largest for F−. Accordingly, the theoretical cross sections for Br−
and I− are in better agreement (HF values of κ = 0.528, 0.508 respectively; compare
to the true values of κ = 0.497, 0.474 for j = 3
2 , see table 1). It is worth pointing out
that the calculations for halogens that employed HF wave functions of the photoelectron
(Crance 1987a, 1987b) produced cross sections close to those obtained within the plane-
wave approximation. From the point of view of our theory this is a consequence
of the importance of large distances for the multiphoton detachment. Therefore, we
have to conclude that the agreement that the theoretical and experimental values had
enjoyed for F− was probably coincidental, caused by the signiﬁcant error in the previous
calculations. On the other hand, the relative magnitudes of the cross sections for F−,
Br− and I− given by our theory are very close to the measured ones.

In the earlier experimental work devoted to the EPD Davidson et al (1991) measured
the ratio between the 5-photon and 4-photon detachment signals in Cl− at ω = 1.165
eV. If the energy of the laser pulse is below the saturation limit, then for a pulse with a
(σ5/σ4)I/ω, where I
Gaussian spatial and temporal proﬁle this ratio is given by
the peak intensity in the pulse. Indeed, the experimental points in ﬁgure 3 of Davidson et
al 1991 display an approximately linear dependence on the intensity. The corresponding
slope can be estimated as 0.0415, if the intensity is in units of 1012 W/cm2, which is quite
close to our theoretical estimate of 0.0466. When the cross sections of Crance 1988 are
used, a value of 0.053 is obtained. The diﬀerence between our theory and that based on
the HF description of the negative ion is not as large for the ratio of the cross sections,
1012 W/cm2,
as it is for the cross sections themselves. At the peak intensity of 2.4
well into the saturation regime, we calculated the ratio of 4- and 6-photon detachments
to be 120, with the experimental value between 70 and 200.

The EPD was also measured for Au−, where 2-, 3-, and possibly 4-photon
detachment signals were observed at ω = 1.165 eV (Stapelfeldt et al 1991). However,
the interpretation of that experiment is not straightforward, because already at 1
15 of
1012 W/cm2 achieved in that experiment the n = 2
the maximal laser intensity of 3
channel is closed due to the ponderomotive threshold shift.

Equation (4) can be used to calculate angular distributions of photoelectrons studied
by Blondel et al (1991,1992) and Dulieu et al (1995). For the 2-photon detachment from
halogen negative ion at ω = 2.331 eV the shapes of the diﬀerential cross sections from
equation (4) are close to those produced by the ‘HF + plane-wave’ calculations presented
in ﬁgure 3 of Blondel et al 1992, the diﬀerence in the absolute values aside. They
reproduce well the features of the experimental data. In some cases our calculations
are in better agreement with the experiment, e.g., for Cl−, Br− (2P3/2 ﬁnal state), or
F−, see ﬁgure 3. Note that for F− the analytical result (4) is also in good agreement
with the numerical calcultions of Pan and Starace (1991), where electron correlations
in the initial, intermediate and ﬁnal states of the 2-photon process have been taken into
account. The largest discrepancy between the theory and experiment is observed for I−.

7

Similar conslusions can be drawn from the comparison of our angular distributions at
ω = 1.165 eV (ﬁgure 3 of Gribakin and Kuchiev 1996) with the experimental results for
F−, n = 3 , 4 , 5, Cl−, n = 4, Br−, n = 3, and I−, n = 3 (Blondel et al 1991, Dulieu et
al 1995). Overall, the simple analytical expression (4) reproduces remarkably well the
complicated oscillatory pattern of the photoelectron angular distributions.

In summary, our theory of multiphoton detachment in a strong laser ﬁeld (Gribakin
and Kuchiev 1996) yields very simple formulae for the n-photon detachment cross
sections and photoelectron angular distributions. Apart from ω and n they depend
only on the electron orbital angular momentum l and the two constants A and κ which
characterize the behaviour of the bound-state wave function at large distances. The
correct asymptotic behaviour of the bound-state wave fucntion at large distances is
crucial for obtaining correct absolute values of the n-photon cross sections. The fact
that the theory is based on the properties of the wave function at large separations from
the atom make it very reliable. At the same time the simple structure of our ﬁnal results
permits make quick estimates of the cross sections for any negative ion. We have applied
the theory to the negative ions and processes studied experimentally, and found that our
results are in reasonable, and in some cases, very good agreement with the experimental
data. Some discrepancies found call for more accurate absolute experimental values.
When more sophisticated calculations are performed, our formulae can be used as a
benchmark, to demonstrate the role of various possible corrections, which are expected
be small for the processes considered. Of course, there are other processes where many-
electron correlations play a decisive role, e.g., multiple photodetachment or ionization
(Kuchiev 1987, 1995, 1996).

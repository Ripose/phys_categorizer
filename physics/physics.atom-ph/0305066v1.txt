Abstract

A possibility for fundamental constants to vary in time is suggested by
theories unifying gravity with other interactions. In this article we examine
proposals to use optical transitions of Sr, Dy, YbII and YbIII for the search
of the time variation of the ﬁne structure constant α. Frequencies of atomic
transitions are calculated using relativistic Hartree-Fock method and conﬁgu-
ration interaction technique. The eﬀect of variation of α on the frequencies is
studied by varying α in computer codes. Accuracy of measurements needed
to improve current best limit on the time variation of α is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Theories unifying gravity with other interactions suggest that fundamental constants
could vary in space-time (see, e.g. [1]). Recent evidence of variation of the ﬁne structure
constant α in quasar absorption spectra [2] elevated interest to the search of variation of α
in laboratory experiments. Comparing frequencies of diﬀerent atomic transitions over long
period of time is a good way to do such search due to extremely high accuracy of mea-
surements achieved for certain types of transitions. The best limit on local present-time
variation of the ﬁne structure constant published so far was obtained by comparing Hg+
microwave atomic clock vs hydrogen maser [3]. Recently this limit was further improved
by more than an order of magnitude in comparing cesium and rubidium atomic clocks [4].
There are also many proposals for the search of variation of α in atomic optical transitions,
some of which were analyzed in our previous works (see [5] and references therein). In the
present paper we analyze three new proposals involving strontium/calcium, dual beam [6],
dysprosium atom [5,7] and ytterbium positive ions Y b+ [8] and Y b2+ [9]. We perform rela-
tivistic many-body calculations to link variation of α with the variation of the frequencies of
atomic transitions. Then we use this connection to ﬁnd out what accuracy of measurements
is needed to improve current best limit on time variation of the ﬁne structure constant.

In the proposal suggested by S. Bergeson strontium-calcium dual beam is to be used
to compare the frequencies of the 1S0 −3 P1 clock transitions in these atoms over a long
period of time. Ca and Sr have similar electron structure. However, due to higher nuclear
charge, relativistic eﬀects are larger for strontium. If α is changing, corresponding change
in frequency of the clock transition for Sr would go considerably faster than for Ca. Precise
measurements might be able to indicate this or, at least, put strong constrain on possible
variation of α. Calculations of the relativistic eﬀects for Ca were done in our previous work
[5]. In present paper we do similar calculations for Sr.

Experiments with ytterbium positive ion have advantages of greater relativistic eﬀects
due to larger nuclear charge and the convenience of working with two diﬀerent transitions
of the same element. There are two transitions in Yb+ involving metastable states for
which comparison of frequencies is considered. One is quadrupole transition 4f 146s 2S1/2 −
4f 145d 2D5/2 and another is octupole transition 4f 146s 2S1/2−4f 136s2 2F7/2. The quadrupole
transition is basically a s−d transition while the octupole one is a f −s transition. According
to simple analytical formula presented in Ref. [5] relativistic energy shifts for s electrons,
and electrons with high total momentum j (like d and f electrons) are large but have
opposite sign. This means that we should expect that two metastable states of Yb+ move
in opposite directions if α is changing. This brings extra enhancement to the sensitivity of
the measurements for Yb+ to the variation of α. Our accurate calculations presented below
support these considerations.

The proposal for dysprosium is quite diﬀerent from what was considered so far. Instead of
comparing two very stable atomic clock frequencies the authors of this proposal [5] suggest
to measure very small frequency of the transition between two almost degenerate states
of opposite parity in dysprosium. The states are 4f 105d6s 3[10]10 E = 19797.96cm−1 and
4f 95d26s 9K10 E = 19797.96cm−1. These states were used before for the search of parity
non-conservation in Dy [11]. Small energy splitting and diﬀerent electron structure of these
two states lead to very strong enhancement of the sensitivity of the frequency of transition

2

between the states to variation of α. The enhancement (about eight orders of magnitude)
seems to be strong enough to overcome the disadvantage of dealing with states which are
not very narrow.

In the present paper we calculate the values of relativistic energy shifts for Sr, Yb+ and
Dy and discuss what accuracy of measurements is needed to improve current best constrain
on local time variation of the ﬁne structure constant.

II. CALCULATIONS OF ENERGIES

We use relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) and conﬁguration interaction (CI) methods to

do the calculations.

RHF Hamiltonian is used to generate a set of single-electron orbitals. We use a form of

singe-electron wave function which explicitly depends on the ﬁne structure constant α:

ψ(r)njlm =

1
r  

fn(r)Ω(n)jlm
iαgn(r) ˜Ω(n)jlm !

Then the RHF equation for ψ(r)n has the following form (in atomic units)

′

n(r) + κn
f
g

r fn(r) − [2 + α2(ǫn − ˆVHF )]gn(r) = 0,
r fn(r) + (ǫn − ˆVHF )fn(r) = 0,

n(r) − κn

′

here κ = (−1)l+j+1/2(j + 1/2), n is the principal quantum number and ˆVHF is the Hartree-
Fock potential. The value of relativistic eﬀects is studied by varying the value of α in (2).
In particular, non-relativistic limit corresponds to α = 0.

In the CI calculations we use approach similar to what was ﬁrst developed in Ref. [12].
Electrons occupying open shells are considered as valence electrons and all other are core
electrons. Correlations between valence electrons are treated within the CI method while
correlations between valence and core electrons are included by means of the many-body
perturbation theory. The eﬀective CI Hamiltonian for valence electrons is presented by

Here N is the number of valence electrons and ˆhi is an eﬀective singe-electron Hamiltonian

ˆH CI =

ˆhi +

N

Xi=1

rij

.

Xi<j

ˆhi = cαp + (β − 1)mc2 − Ze2
ri

+ ˆVcore + ˆΣ1

Here Vcore is the Hartree-Fock potential created by core electrons. It diﬀers from VHF in Eq.
(2) by contribution of valence electrons. ˆΣ1 is so called “correlation potential” operator. It
describes correlations between a particular valence electron and core electrons (see Ref. [12]
for details). Note that in contrast with Ref. [12] we don’t include in present work the ˆΣ2
operator, which is a two-electron operator describing diﬀerent type of correlations between
valence and core electrons. Terms with ˆΣ2 can be considered as screening of Coulomb
interaction between valence electrons by core electrons. These terms are less important

3

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

than those with ˆΣ1 but much more time consuming in calculations. We either neglect them
or simulate their eﬀect by introducing screening factors.

We are now going to discuss the speciﬁcs of the calculations for each atom/ion. Apart
from the states of interest we also calculate energies of the other states of the same con-
ﬁgurations to ensure that the accuracy is systematically good. We also calculate magnetic
g-factors to ensure correct identiﬁcation of states. This is particularly important for dys-
prosium.

A. Strontium

Strontium in its ground state is a closed-shell atom.

It has two 5s-electrons on its
outermost shell and we need to consider energy intervals between 1S0 ground state and
states of the 5s5p conﬁguration where the 3P1 metastable state is of most interest. The RHF
calculations for Sr were done in V N approximation, for a closed-shell atom in its ground
state. For the CI calculations we considered Sr as an atom with two valence electrons and
followed the similar calculations for Ba [13]. Basis states for the CI+MBPT method were
calculated using the B-spline technique [14] with 40 B-splines in a cavity of radius R = 40aB.
The same basis functions were used to calculate ˆΣ1 and for the CI calculations. Thirteen
lowest states above core in each of the s1/2, p1/2, p3/2, d3/2 and d5/2 waves were used to
construct two-electron wave function for both 5s2 and 5s5p conﬁgurations. Large number
of basis functions is needed mostly for adequate description of the 5s5p conﬁguration. This
is because the V N approximation doesn’t provide us with a good 5p single-electron state.
Also, the 5s single-electron state in the 5s5p conﬁguration is diﬀerent from the 5s state in
the 5s2 conﬁguration for which Hartree-Fock calculations were done. However, with thirteen
states in each wave the saturation of the basis was clearly achieved and adding more states
to the basis didn’t change the energy. Two-electron basis states for the CI calculations were
obtained by distributing valence electrons over 65 basis states (13 × 5) in all possible ways
with a restriction of ﬁxed parity and total momentum.

The results are presented in Table I. As one can see the accuracy for the state of the

interest 3P1 is better than 1% while accuracy for other states is also good.

B. Ytterbium

The ground state of ytterbium positive ion is 4f 146s 2S1/2 and we need to consider
transitions into the 4f 145d 2D5/2 and 4f 136s2 2F7/2 states. Therefore it is convenient to do
the RHF calculations in the V N −1 approximation, for the Yb2+ ion with the 4f 14 closed-shell
conﬁguration. The 6s, 5d and other basis states for the CI method are calculated then in the
ﬁeld of frozen closed-shell core of Yb2+. Then, in the CI calculations, we need to consider
all 4f electrons as valence ones since one of the transitions of the interest involves excitation
from the 4f subshell. So, the total number of valence electrons in present CI calculations
is ﬁfteen. This is very diﬀerent from our previous calculations for Yb+ [5] in which the
4f 136s2 2F7/2 state was not considered and we were able to treat ytterbium ion as a system
with one external electron above closed shells.

4

Our ﬁnal set of single-electron states for the CI calculations consisted of 4f5/2, 4f7/2,
6s1/2, 5d3/2, 5d5/2 and few more s and f states above 4f and 6s. Note that in contrast with
Sr we don’t need many basis functions here because all our single-electron wave functions
correspond to the Yb+. This makes initial approximation to be very good and leads to fast
convergence of the CI calculations with respect to the basis set used.

We also don’t include ˆΣ1 in calculations for Yb+. In a case of many valence electrons
(ﬁfteen for Yb+) correlations are dominated by correlations between them which are taken
into account accurately via the CI technique. Correlations between valence electrons and
core electrons mostly manifest themself via screening of the Coulomb interaction between
valence electrons. We take this eﬀect into account semiempirically, by introducing screening
factors fk. Namely, we multiply every Coulomb integral of the multipolarity k by a numerical
factor fk which is chosen to ﬁt the energies. It turns out that good ﬁt for Yb+ is achieved
with f2 = 0.8 and fk = 1 for all other k.

Many-electron basis states for the CI calculations were obtained by allowing all possible
single and double excitations from the base conﬁguration with the restriction of ﬁxed parity
and total momentum.

Results for energies of Yb+ are presented in Table I. The theoretical accuracy for energies
as compared to the experiment is 2- 3% for the states of interest and is not worse than 5%
for other states.

C. Dysprosium

Dysprosium atom is the most diﬃcult for calculations because of its complicated electron
structure. Ground state conﬁguration of Dy is 4f 106s2 which means that there is no realistic
RHF approximation which corresponds to a closed-shell system. We do the RHF calculations
for Dy in the V N approximation with an open-shell version of the RHF method. Contribution
of the 4f electrons into the RHF potential is calculated as for a closed shell and then
multiplied by a numerical factor to take into account its fractional occupancy. This factor is
10/14 when interaction of the 4f electrons with other core electrons is considered and 9/13
when interaction of a 4f electron with other 4f electrons is considered. When convergence
is achieved we have the 4f and 6s basis states for the CI calculations. To calculate other
states of valence electrons we remove one 6s electron, freeze all RHF orbitals, including 4f
and 6s and calculate the 6p1/2, 6p3/2, 5d3/2, 5d5/2 and few more d-states above 5d in the ﬁeld
of frozen RHF core.

In the CI calculations states below 4f are considered as core states and all other as
valence states. Total number of valence electrons is therefore twelve. As for the case of
Yb+ we neglect ˆΣ1 and use screening factors as ﬁtting parameters to improve agreement
with experiment. It turns out that best ﬁt for the 4f 106s6p conﬁguration is achieved with
f1 = 0.7 and fk = 1 for all other k. No ﬁtting was used for other conﬁgurations.

To calculate states of the 4f 106s2, 4f 106s6p and 4f 106s5d conﬁgurations we use the
4f5/2, 4f7/2, 6s1/2, 6p1/2, 6p3/2, 5d3/2 and 5d5/2 single-electron basis functions and all pos-
sible conﬁgurations which can be obtained from these basis functions by exciting of one or
two electrons from the base conﬁguration. Same approach doesn’t work for the 4f 95d26s
conﬁguration because of huge number of many-electron basis states generated this way and
as a consequence, the CI matrix is of so large size that it could not be handled by our

5

computers. On the other hand test calculations with pairs of conﬁgurations showed that
mixing of our state of interest with other conﬁgurations is small and can be neglected. We
do need however to include mixing with the 4f 95d6d6s, 4f 95d7d6s and 4f 96d26s conﬁgura-
tions. This is because our basis 5d state corresponds rather to the 4f 105d6s conﬁguration
and extra d-states are needed to correct it.

The result are presented in Table I. Note that they are considerably better than in our
previous calculations [15]. This is because of better basis and more complete CI treatment.

III. FREQUENCY SHIFT: RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

In the vicinity of the physical value of the ﬁne structure constant (α = α0) frequency

(ω) of an atomic transition can be presented in a form

0) − 1, ω0 is the experimental value of the frequency and q is a coeﬃcient
where x = (α2/α2
which determines the frequency dependence on the variation of α. To ﬁnd the values of q for
7
diﬀerent atomic transitions we repeat all calculations for α =
8α0.
Then

9
8α0, α = α0 and α =

q

q

ω = ω0 + qx,

q = 4(ω+ − ω−),

9
8α0, and ω− is the value of ω forα =

7
8 α0. Calculations
Where ω+ is the value of ω for α =
for α = α0 are done to compare the theory with experiment and to check whether frequencies
are linear functions of α2. The results for coeﬃcients q are presented in Table II. Note that
we have included in the Table the results of our old calculations for Yb+. These calculations
were done in a very diﬀerent way, assuming that Yb+ is an atom with one external electron
above closed shells. Comparison of the results obtained by diﬀerent methods gives estimate
of the accuracy of calculations.

Search for the time variation of the ﬁne structure constant can be conducted by compar-
ing two frequencies of atomic transitions over long period of time. The measured value can
be presented as [5,3]

Using Eq. (5) one can reduce Eq. (7) to

∆(t) =

Current best laboratory limit on the time variation of α is ˙α/α < 10−15yr−1 [4].

In the ﬁrst experiment considered in this paper a dual calcium-strontium beam is to be
used to compare the frequencies of the 1S0 −3 P1 transitions in both atoms. Substituting
ω1 = 15210cm−1, q1 = 230cm−1 for Ca [5], ω2 = 14504cm−1, q2 = 667cm−1 for Sr (Tables
I,II) and ˙α/α = 10−15yr−1 we get

(6)

(7)

(8)

∆(t)(Sr-Ca) = 6.2 × 10−17yr−1.

Note that the width of 3P1 state in Sr may be a problem in this case.

In the case of Yb+ frequencies of the 2S1/2 −2 D5/2 and 2S1/2 −2 F7/2 are to be compared.

Substituting the numbers we get

∆(t)(Yb+) = 6.1 × 10−15yr−1.

Note two orders of magnitude improvement in the magnitude in comparison with the Sr-Ca
dual beam experiment.

We have also calculated q-coeﬃcient for 4f 14 1S0 - 4f 135d 3P0 (ω = 45276 cm−1) tran-
sition from YbIII ground state. This was motivated by the proposed measurements [9] of
α-variation using comparison of 1S0 - 3P0 transition frequencies in In+, Tl+ and odd isotope
of Yb++. The diﬀerent signs and magnitudes of relativistic corrections in In+ (q= 4414
cm−1), Tl+ (q=19745 cm−1) and Yb++ (q= -27800 cm−1) provide an excellent control of
systematic errors since systematic errors are not correlated with signs and magnitudes of
0) − 1. The same idea (combination of anchors,
the frequency shifts qx, where x = (α2/α2
positive shifters and negative shifters) has been used to control systematic errors in Ref. [2].
In our view, a very interesting possibility is that for dysprosium. Instead of comparing
frequencies of diﬀerent transitions one should measure the energy diﬀerence between two
very close states of opposite parity. The corresponding q-coeﬃcient is q = 6008 + 23708 =
29716cm−1 (see Table II). The frequency of this transition ranges from few MHz to few GHz
depending on isotopes and hfs components used. If we take, e.g. ω = 3.1MHz [10] we get

This is an eight orders of magnitude enhancement in the relative value of the eﬀect compared
to atomic clock transitions! Substituting ˙α/α = 10−15yr−1 we get

∆(t)(Dy) = 5.7 × 108(

˙α
α0

).

∆(t)(Dy) = 5.7 × 10−7yr−1.

(12)

This means that to improve current best limit on local time variation of α the frequency of
this transition in Dy should be measured to the accuracy of about 10−7 over about a year
time interval. This seems to be feasible [7].

Abstract. Recent experiments with ultracold neutral plasmas show an intrinsic
heating eﬀect based on the development of spatial correlations, which has been termed
“correlation heating”. We investigate whether this eﬀect can be reversed, so that
imposing strong spatial correlations could in fact lead to cooling. We ﬁnd that cooling
is indeed possible. It requires, however, a very precise preparation of the initial state.
Quantum mechanical zero-point motion sets a lower limit for cooling.

Over the last two decades, techniques of cooling and trapping of ions and neutral
atoms have made tremendous progress, making the regime of ultralow temperatures
(T
1 K) accessible to experiment. Using sophisticated cooling schemes, temperatures
far below 1µK have been realized, allowing, among many other applications, Bose-
Einstein condensation of dilute atomic gases. Nevertheless, known cooling mechanisms
either have a lower limit beyond which cooling is not possible (such as in “standard”
laser cooling) or suﬀer from other drawbacks (such as loss of particles in evaporative
cooling). Moreover, not all atomic species are equally suitable for the diﬀerent cooling
techniques. Hence, interest in alternative cooling schemes continues. In the following,
we explore the possibility of “correlation cooling” of ionic gases.

The idea of “correlation cooling” arises almost naturally from progress in the
experimental realization and theoretical description of ultracold neutral plasmas.
Experimentally,
such cold neutral plasmas could be realized only recently by
photoionizing a cloud of ultracold atoms [1, 2, 3]. From a plasma physics perspective,
they are very appealing since they might provide laboratory realizations of so-called
strongly coupled plasmas, where the Coulomb interaction (inversely proportional to the
mean inter-particle spacing a) dominates the random thermal motion (proportional to
the temperature T ). As a consequence, interesting ordering phenomena such as Coulomb
crystallization can be observed. In order to be in this strong-coupling regime, a system
has to be either very dense (large Coulomb interaction) or very cold (little thermal
energy). The ﬁrst scenario is realized in some astrophysical contexts, which are diﬃcult
to access experimentally. Hence, the possibility to realize a strongly coupled plasma
in the laboratory by going to ultralow temperatures oﬀered exciting prospects within
the plasma physics community.
In [1], an ultracold neutral plasma has been created
by photoionizing a gas of laser-cooled Xe atoms. The extremely low temperatures of
the Xe gas suggested that the system was well within the strong-coupling regime, the
e2/(akBT ), i.e. the ratio of potential to
so-called Coulomb coupling parameter Γ
≡
thermal energy, being of the order of 10 for the electrons and even up to 30000 for the
ions
. However, it was realized quickly [4, 5, 6] that despite the low temperature of
‡
the Xe gas a strongly coupled plasma could not be created in this way. Due to the
fact that the neutral Xe atoms initially present interact only very weakly, the plasma
is created in a completely uncorrelated non-equilibrium state. Hence, the subsequent
conversion of potential into kinetic energy rapidly heats both the electron and ion
subsystem, suppressing the development of substantial correlations [4, 7]. This eﬀect
has been termed “correlation heating”, expressing the fact that it is the development
of correlations during the relaxation of the plasma towards an equilibrium state which
leads to an increase in temperature. Put another way, in the initial non-equilibrium
state the potential energy is higher than in the corresponding equilibrium state of a
plasma of the same average density. Consequently, relaxation towards thermodynamic

The large mass diﬀerence between electrons and ions implies a very long timescale for energy transfer

between the two subsystems. Hence, for practical purposes it is justiﬁed to treat them as (almost)
independent and assign diﬀerent temperatures to both subsystems.

equilibrium will reduce the potential energy in the system and increase the kinetic
energy, i.e. the temperature
. Within the context of the creation of a strongly coupled
§
plasma, diﬀerent procedures have been suggested to avoid this heating eﬀect, namely (i)
using fermionic atoms cooled below the Fermi temperature in the initial state, so that
the Fermi hole around each atom prevents the occurence of small interatomic distances
[7]; (ii) an intermediate step of exciting atoms into high Rydberg states, so that the
interatomic spacing is at least twice the radius of the corresponding Rydberg state [6];
(iii) mixing the plasma with a gas of Rydberg atoms, so that collisional ionization of
these Rydberg atoms removes energy from the plasma component of the system [8];
and (iv) the continuous laser-cooling of the plasma ions after their initial creation, so
that the correlation heating is counterbalanced by the external cooling [9, 10]. So far,
none of these procedures has been realized experimentally, however it has been shown
theoretically that continuous laser-cooling can indeed lead to a strongly coupled plasma,
connected with crystallization of the expanding system [10]. While in the cases (iii) and
(iv) the heating eﬀect is still present and is oﬀset by an additional external cooling
mechanism, the ﬁrst two proposals aim at suppressing the heating directly by avoiding
the small interparticle distances leading to a large potential energy, i.e. by introducing
(spatial) correlation in the initial state. As has already been noted in [6], this could also
be achieved using optical lattices to arrange the atoms.

At this point, the question arises naturally whether this heating eﬀect could not
only be avoided, but whether it can actually be reversed and turned into cooling. As
argued above, correlation heating describes the fact that the uncorrelated ions created in
the photoionization process have a higher potential energy than in the thermodynamical
equilibrium state. Hence, equilibration will reduce the potential energy and increase the
kinetic energy of the system, making the ions hotter than the atoms in the initial gas
state. On the other hand, it is conceivable that the atomic gas might be prepared in an
“overcorrelated” state, where the potential energy is lower than its equilibrium value.
Taken to the extreme, one may think of an initial state where all atoms are arranged
in a regular bcc lattice structure corresponding to the potential minimum. In this case,
equilibration must increase the potential energy on the cost of the kinetic energy, i.e.
the temperature must decrease! Hence, the following questions will be addressed in the
following: Under which experimental conditions, if at all, could “correlation cooling”
be realized? How much cooling is possible, and can it be turned into a useful tool?
Which are the temperatures and densities that could be achieved in this way? From
the foregoing discussion it is clear that the method could only be used to cool ions, not
neutral atoms, since their interaction is too weak and the potential energy is essentially
zero.

In view of the fact that the initial state of the plasma is far from equilibrium, it is not really justiﬁed to
§
associate a temperature with it, the properties of the system are not those of a state in thermodynamical
equilibrium with the same kinetic energy. However, before the photoionization occurs the atomic gas
has a well-deﬁned temperature, and it is the temperature of these atoms that can be compared to that
of the ions after equilibration.

In order to numerically simulate the correlation cooling process, we describe a
situation where the atoms have been arranged in a regular bcc-type lattice structure
using an optical lattice. In reality, their spatial distribution will be broadened, classically
due to their non-vanishing kinetic energy corresponding to the initial-state temperature,
quantum mechanically corresponding to the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator
potential generated by the optical lattice. This broadening is neglected in our numerical
simulations, however, its inﬂuence will be discussed in the analytical considerations
below. For the sake of numerical simplicity, our initial state corresponds to a sphere
cut out from a bcc lattice rather than a more realistic cylindrical shape, arguing that
edge eﬀects should be of minor importance if the number of atoms in the system is
large enough. For all simulations, the number Ni of ions was chosen to be 105. The
initial distribution of the electrons is obtained selfconsistently from the ion distribution,
assuming an initial electron energy for which Γe = 0.5. The system is propagated using
the hybrid molecular dynamics method described in [10], where the electrons are treated
on a hydrodynamic level while the ions are propagated in a full MD simulation.

Figure 1(a) shows the time evolution of the average ion kinetic energy in units of the
initial-state temperature for a typical realization. Since the initial lattice conﬁguration
produces an eﬀective oscillator potential for each ion, the relaxation process is connected
with transient oscillations of the kinetic energy which are damped out due to ion-ion
collisions. Additionally, the average kinetic energy increases at later times due to a
radial ion acceleration caused by the thermal electron pressure, which is proportional to
the density gradient. Therefore the slow expansion of the unconﬁned plasma leads to a
softening of the initially sharp plasma edge and a modiﬁcation of the velocity distribution
in the outer region of the plasma only. Since this distribution is close to a Maxwellian
in the central region of the plasma, the average kinetic energy is directly related to
the ionic temperature T , while it becomes more and more dominated by the expansion
energy towards the edge of the plasma. In order to highlight these edge eﬀects, we have
calculated the average ion kinetic energy from the velocity distribution in the inner
region only, taken to be a sphere with half of the initial plasma radius. The resulting
curve is shown as the dashed line in ﬁgure 1(a). Clearly, the expansion hardly aﬀects
the kinetic energy in the inner region of the plasma, leaving only the oscillations which
are damped out as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium. The relaxation
towards equilibrium takes place on a timescale of ω−1
0 , while the typical timescale for
i ω−1
e2/Ma3 is the Einstein
the plasma expansion is texp
frequency in the Wigner-Seitz model of a Coulomb solid and M is the ion mass. Hence,
a suﬃciently large number of ions allows for an almost unperturbed relaxation in the
inner plasma region so that a temperature can be deﬁned in a meaningful way. Using
the absorption imaging techniques described in [11] it should be possible experimentally
to probe this inner region only. Therefore, we chose to deﬁne the ﬁnal temperature as
given by the inner plasma region and to neglect the ﬁnite-size eﬀects associated with the
boundary region of the plasma. The resulting Tf was estimated from the center of the
remaining oscillations and is shown in ﬁgure 1(b) as a function of Γi by the full circles.

as a function of the density-scaled inverse initial temperature Γi, from the numerical
simulations (full circles) and from equation (6) (solid line). The inset shows the ﬁnal
Coulomb coupling parameter.

It should be noted that the value of Γi has no meaning as a measure of nonideality of
the initial plasma state, since the system may be far from equilibrium. Therefore, in the
present case it should simply be viewed as a density-scaled inverse temperature rather
than a Coulomb coupling parameter. As can be seen in the ﬁgure, the ratio of ﬁnal
to initial temperature reaches a constant value of about 0.5 as the initial temperature
goes to zero. Hence, cooling can indeed be achieved, however on a moderate level of a
temperature reduction of about 50 percent.

More insight into the cooling process can be gained by increasing the size of
the system to inﬁnity, corresponding to the one-component plasma model. This
system consists of pointlike particles embedded in an oppositely charged homogeneous
background. It has been studied extensively over the last decades [12, 13], which led to
a detailed understanding of the equation of state over a wide parameter range. In the
classical regime, the energy per particle of the ﬁnal equilibrium state is given by

where the excess energy W accounts for nonideal eﬀects due to the inter-particle
Coulomb interaction. For this quantity, several ﬁt formulae can be found in the
literature, which have been obtained by Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics methods

Let us now turn to the question of the inﬂuence of possible lattice defects, i.e. how

as the generalization of equation (6) to non-perfect ﬁlling. In ﬁgure 2(a), we show the
resulting ﬁnal temperature as a function of the ﬁlling factor for two diﬀerent Γi. A
decreasing ﬁlling enhances the initial potential energy (compared to that of a full lattice
with the same average density, not the same lattice constant), leading to a rapid increase
of the ﬁnal temperature. As a consequence, cooling can be achieved for a nearly perfect
lattice only. Furthermore, for a ﬁxed f < 1, increasing Γi leads to larger values for
the temperature ratio. This heating also inﬂuences the possibility of the creation of a
crystallized plasma phase, since the melting point of Γf = 174 is shifted to larger values
of Γi, as shown in the phase diagram ﬁgure 2(b). For values of f < 0.9855, the system
always ends up in the ﬂuid phase independent of Γi.

The above picture suggests that, for a perfect initial state, cooling is always
possible independent of the initial temperature. At low enough temperatures, however,
the classical treatment will break down, and quantum mechanical eﬀects will become
internal energy of a
important. As in the classical case the quantum statistical

can be written as a sum of the Madelung energy, harmonic contributions

arising from linear lattice excitations and anharmonic corrections. For the harmonic
contributions to the excess energy we use an analytic approximation formula obtained
recently [19], which reproduces the numerical results for harmonic Coulomb crystals very
accurately. The anharmonic corrections are taken from [20], where they were obtained

As mentioned previously, for typical experimental setups as in [1], Γi is of the order of 10000, i.e.

assuming an unchanged density matrix directly after the photoionization pulse. The
initial energy of the plasma is thus found from the expectation value of the new

In summary, we have discussed the possibility of correlation cooling and of the
creation of ultracold ions by photoionization of a highly ordered state of cold atoms,
achievable with optical lattices. Classical considerations have shown that the initial
temperature can be reduced by a factor of two if the atomic sample is noninteracting
initially, oﬀering the possibility to reach ion temperatures which have not been achieved
so far. The quantum regime has been investigated using existing expressions for the
equilibrium internal energy of the system. Here it was found that the ﬁnal temperature
approaches a constant value which arises from zero-point oscillations in the lattice
potentials and depends on the density as well as the geometry of the optical lattice.
An almost perfect lattice is necessary to observe the discussed cooling eﬀects, since even
a small amount of lattice defects largely increases the ﬁnal temperature. However, it
has been demonstrated that it is possible to create regular structures with a well-deﬁned
number of atoms localized in the potential wells of an optical lattice [22].

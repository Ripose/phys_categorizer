A phase-stabilized femtosecond laser comb is directly used for high-resolution spectroscopy
and absolute optical frequency measurements of one- and two-photon transitions in laser-cooled
87Rb atoms. Absolute atomic transition frequencies, such as the 5S1/2 F=2 → 7S1/2 F”=2 two-
photon resonance measured at 788 794 768 921(44) kHz, are determined without a priori knowledge
about their values. Detailed dynamics of population transfer driven by a sequence of pulses are
uncovered and taken into account for the measurement of the 5P states via resonantly enhanced
two-photon transitions.

Phase-stabilized optical

frequency combs based on
mode-locked femtosecond lasers have formed a power-
ful connection between the ﬁelds of precision measure-
ment and ultrafast science [1, 2, 3]. Numerous applica-
tions have ensued, including measurements of absolute
optical frequencies [4, 5, 6] and the development of op-
tical atomic clocks [7, 8, 9]. Recent work has demon-
strated that optical frequency combs are a highly eﬃcient
tool for precise studies of atomic structure [10, 11]. Di-
rect frequency comb spectroscopy (DFCS) has been per-
formed on the 5S-5D two-photon transitions in Rb, per-
mitting high-resolution spectroscopy of all atomic transi-
tions covered by the comb bandwidth. Additionally, this
approach provides signiﬁcant advantages for precise stud-
ies of time domain dynamics, coherent accumulation and
interference, and quantum control [11]. An extension of
frequency comb metrology to the deep-ultraviolet spec-
tral region (where continuous wave lasers are not readily
available) was recently achieved by using the 4th har-
monic of a femtosecond laser [12].

In this work, we apply DFCS to determine absolute
atomic transition frequencies anywhere within the comb
bandwidth, for one- and two-photon processes. By mea-
suring the previously unknown absolute frequency of the
5S-7S two-photon transitions in 87Rb, we show that prior
knowledge of atomic transition frequencies is not essen-
tial for this technique to work, and indicate that it can be
applied in a broad context. When resonant enhancement
is enabled by a comb component tuned near an interme-
diate 5P state, we observe two-photon transitions occur-
ring between initial and ﬁnal states that diﬀer by one unit
of the total angular momentum (∆F = ±1), which are
absent for far-detuned intermediate states. This capa-
bility of accessing adjacent excited hyperﬁne levels from
the same ground state allows for direct measurements of
hyperﬁne splittings. Additionally, we demonstrate that
DFCS can be equally well applied to measuring single-
photon transitions and have chosen the 5S-5P transitions
in 87Rb for such a demonstration. The measurement of
5P states has also been carried out indirectly via the 5S-
5D two-photon transitions by studying their resonant en-

hancement when comb components are scanned through
the intermediate 5P states. We compare the 5P measure-
ments obtained via one-photon and two-photon DFCS
and clearly demonstrate the importance of population
transfer in working with multilevel systems probed by
multiple comb components.

The spectrum of a mode-locked femtosecond laser has
a set of discrete optical frequencies that are described by
the simple relation νN = N fr + f0, where N is a large
integer on the order of 106. The lines are spaced by fr,
the pulse repetition rate, and have a common oﬀset f0,
the carrier-envelope oﬀset frequency. For spectroscopic
studies with a femtosecond laser, both parameters fr and
f0 are precisely controlled and stabilized to low-noise op-
tical or radio frequency oscillators [13].
In the current
experiment, the output of a 20-fs, 100-MHz repetition
rate Ti:Sapphire laser with a full width at half maximum
of ∼55 nm is used to directly interrogate a sample of
laser-cooled 87Rb atoms. For the two-photon case, we
study the transitions from the ground 5S1/2 state to the
excited 7S1/2 state, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The two inde-
pendent parameters fr and f0 provide freedom in choos-
ing an appropriate frequency comb for control of reso-
nant signal enhancement via the intermediate 5P1/2 and
5P3/2 states. The relevant lifetimes are 88 ns for the
7S states [14] and 27 ns for the 5P states. The excited
state population is determined from the 7S-6P-5S radia-
tive cascade: the 7S atoms decay to the 6P state and then
down to the ground state, emitting photons at 420 nm.
These blue photons are detected with a photomultiplier
tube (PMT) centered at 420 nm and are counted and
subsequently time-binned with a multi-channel photon
counter. The typical loading cycle used for the magneto-
optical trap (MOT) is 100 Hz and the sequence of the ex-
periment is as follows [Fig. 1(b)]: the atoms are loaded in
the MOT for 7.8 ms, then the quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld
for the trap is switched oﬀ, the atoms are cooled with
polarization gradient (PGC) for 2 ms, then all the MOT
beams are extinguished, the femtosecond comb beam is
switched on for 200 µs using a Pockels cell (8-ns rise
time), and ﬁnally, the 420 nm ﬂuorescence is detected.

FIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Schematic of the 87Rb energy levels
participating in the 5S-7S two-photon transitions and 5S-5P
single-photon transitions. For the two-photon studies, the
measured 5S-7S transitions were resonantly enhanced by the
5P states shown. For the 5P state measurements, the 5S-5P
transitions are studied both directly and indirectly, using the
5P enhancement of the 5S-5D two-photon transitions.
(b)
Timing scheme for the 100 Hz experiment cycle where the
200 µs zoom window shows the diﬀerent sequences for the
one- and two-photon measurements. All MOT-related ﬁelds
are turned oﬀ while probing with the femtosecond laser.

For the one-photon studies we have investigated both
the D1 and D2 transitions in 87Rb, namely transitions
from the ground state to the 5P1/2 excited state at 795
nm and to the 5P3/2 state at 780 nm [Fig. 1(a)]. We di-
rectly detect the ﬂuorescence from the two 5P states with
a near-infrared PMT coupled with a 3-nm bandwidth in-
terference ﬁlter centered at the appropriate wavelength
for the transition. Background counts are further min-
imized by spatial ﬁltering and photon collection during
the probe laser-on period is disabled by switching oﬀ the
PMT. As can be seen in the one-photon timing diagram
of Fig. 1(b), during the 200 µs probe window, we have
a sequence of short cycles with the probe laser on (200
ns) followed by the PMT on (400 ns) to detect photons
from the fast-decaying 5P states. A 2.6 µs interval (PMT
switch-oﬀ time) is required before initiating the next laser
cycle. Both the two-photon and the single-photon signals
are averaged over hundreds of 10 ms experiment cycles.
To null the stray magnetic ﬁelds, we apply bias-coil
compensation in three orthogonal directions and make
use of the two-photon signal itself: Zeeman-shifted spec-
tra are obtained with right and left circularly polarized
femtosecond comb light along each direction and the zero-
frequency shift point is determined within ± 20 kHz. Af-
ter nulling the residual B ﬁeld, there remain two dom-
inant sources of systematic frequency shifts, both asso-
ciated with the femtosecond laser. The ﬁrst is the radi-
ation pressure of the probe laser on the atoms and the
second is the AC Stark shift [11]. For the present two-
photon experiment, the line-center values are extrapo-
lated to zero interrogation time to suppress shifts associ-
ated with photon-momentum transfer and the transitions
are probed on optimal resonance (i.e., zero detuning for
both the intermediate state and the ﬁnal state) to mini-
mize the AC Stark shifts.

femtosecond comb with atoms accounts for detailed dy-
namics of population transfer among the atomic states
involved in transitions within the comb bandwidth. The
density matrix for the state of the atomic system is calcu-
lated starting with the Liouville equation, with radiative
relaxation included via phenomenological decay terms.
Impulsive optical excitation followed by free evolution
and decay is used to model the interaction with each
pulse in the train. The density matrix equations are
solved to a fourth order perturbative expansion in the
electric ﬁeld and an iterative numerical scheme is em-
ployed to obtain the state of the atomic system after an
arbitrary number of pulses [11, 15]. This model is applied
to accurately predict the coherent population accumula-
tion in the relatively long-lived 5D or 7S states, followed
by incoherent optical pumping. Especially important for
the indirect 5P measurements is the incoherent optical
pumping to the ground state hyperﬁne levels, which de-
pends critically on the 5P state detunings and will be
discussed in detail below.

We begin by discussing the 5S-7S two-photon fre-
quency measurements. Shown in Fig. 2(a) is a typical
7S1/2 F”=2 Lorentzian lineshape, generated by stepping
the oﬀset frequency f0 for a ﬁxed value of the repetition
rate fr and recording the subsequent blue ﬂuorescence
corresponding to the coherently accumulated 7S popu-
lation. For each data point, to obtain a better signal-
to-noise ratio, the 80 ns-binned counts arising from the
ﬂuorescence are integrated over 2.4 µs. Alternatively,
this lineshape is retrieved by sweeping fr with f0 ﬁxed
at some convenient value. In general, sweeping fr has the
advantage of yielding all the transitions within the laser
bandwidth in only a ∼26 Hz scan. This is due to the fact
that the ratio of one-photon optical transition frequen-
cies (participating in stepwise two-photon transitions) to
fr is ∼4×106, so that for a change in fr of ∼26 Hz the res-
onant enhancement is repeated by the next neighboring
comb component. Once the lineshape has been acquired,

what remains is to identify the correct mode number N
associated with each transition. If the optical frequency
is already known to within fr/2, this is a straightforward
task. For the case of the 5S-7S two-photon transitions,
where the resonance frequencies are not known a priori
(νopt = (N1 + N2)fr + 2f0), we scan the resonances for
two diﬀerent values of fr and unambiguously deduce the
sum of the two associated integers (N1 + N2) [12, 20]. In
our case, the two repetition rates used are separated by
600 kHz to eliminate possible uncertainties arising from
estimations of the f0 value corresponding to the peak of
the resonance.

After identifying the comb numbers associated with
the transition and reducing the systematic error arising
from AC Stark shift, the remaining error from radiation
pressure is suppressed by extrapolating to zero interro-
gation time, as shown in Fig. 2(b). We determine for the
5S1/2 F=2 → 7S1/2 F”=2 and the 5S1/2 F=1 → 7S1/2
F”=1 two-photon transitions in 87Rb the absolute opti-
cal frequencies of 788 794 768 921(44) kHz and 788 800
964 199 (122) kHz, respectively. The excited state hy-
perﬁne interval of 639 404 (130) kHz agrees very well
with a previous diﬀerential measurement performed with
a picosecond pulsed laser [16]. The transition spectra
reported in [16], as well as a CW-based scan [17], indi-
cated that the F=2 → F”=2 and the F=1 → F”=1, i.e.
∆F=0 transitions, were the only allowed 5S-7S transi-
tions in 87Rb. However, we observe additional lines, as
the resonant intermediate 5P state also enables the F=2
→ F”=1 and F=1 → F”=2, i.e., ∆F=±1, two-photon
transitions. Similar ∆F=±1 S-S transitions have been
previously observed in Na in a two-step excitation ex-
periment employing two tunable CW dye lasers, which
enabled a direct measurement of the excited state hyper-
ﬁne splitting [18].

DFCS also works well for absolute frequency measure-
ments of single-photon transitions. DFCS results on
the 5P state energy levels are obtained in one-photon
and two-photon measurements and compared. The one-
photon DFCS employs radiative detection directly from
the 5P states (Fig. 3(a) left panel), while the two-photon
DFCS studies the 5P states indirectly, via resonant en-
hancement of the 5S-5D two-photon transitions as a func-
tion of the detuning from the intermediate 5P states
(Fig. 3(a) right panel). First, we measure the 5S1/2 F=2
→ 5P3/2 F’=3 D2 transition with one-photon DFCS,
with the resultant transition line shown in Fig. 3(b). Fre-
quency scans are carried out similarly to those of the
5S-7S lines, that is, by stepping f0 continuously while
keeping fr ﬁxed. The absolute optical frequency mea-
sured for this transition is 384 228 115 271 (87) kHz. For
the two-photon DFCS, we use a set of diﬀerent pairs of
fr and f0 speciﬁcally chosen to have varying detunings
from the 5P state for each data point shown in Fig. 3(c),
while at the same time satisfying the 5S-5D two-photon
resonance (these transitions have the same decay chan-
nels as the 5S-7S transitions and are also monitored via
the 420 nm ﬂuorescence). The lineshape in Fig. 3(c) is

to mention that for this scan we take advantage of the
5S1/2 F=2 → 5P3/2 F’=3 → 5D5/2 F”=4 being the only
5S-5D ‘closed transition’. As shown in theory plots in
Fig. 3(d), this closed transition ensures that most of the
atoms initially starting out in the F=2 ground-state hy-
perﬁne level remain in that level, while ∼20% of the
atoms fall into the dark F=1 ground state due to optical
pumping and hence do not contribute to the signal. In
addition, the probe laser power is suﬃciently reduced for
the two-photon DFCS experiments to further decrease
optical pumping eﬀects.

Next, we employ DFCS to study another single-photon
transition in the D1 manifold, 5S1/2 F=2 → 5P1/2 F’=2,
as shown in Fig. 4(a). Again, f0 is scanned while fr is
stabilized to a convenient value. The absolute optical
frequency for this transition is determined to be 377
105 206 563 (184) kHz, in agreement with a previous
wavelength-based measurement [19]. For the correspond-
ing two-photon DFCS experiment we map the 5S1/2 F=2

the same manner employed for Fig. 3(c). Figure 4(b)
shows the raw data yielded by these (fr, f0) pair se-
lections, along with a visual guide for the data. The
apparent linewidth is signiﬁcantly broader than that as-
sociated with the 5P state. Unlike the previous two-
photon DFCS measurement reported in Fig. 3, the pairs
of fr and f0 used to obtain each point in Fig. 4(b) lead
to substantially diﬀerent detunings of the other 5P states

and subsequently, varying optical pumping to the F=1
ground state. Indeed, the theory model applied to the
actual experiment conditions predicts signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent ground state population transfer dynamics. As
shown in Fig. 4(c), the asymptotic values of the F=2
ground-state population are not the same for symmet-
ric detunings from the intermediate state. Figure 4(d)
presents the Lorentzian lineshape resulting from the nor-
malization of the raw data shown in Fig. 4(b) with re-
spect to the theoretical value of (1 - ρF =1), where ρF =1 is
the fractional ground state population in F=1, as shown
in Fig. 4(c). After implementing this normalization, the
optical frequency for the transition measured by the two-
photon DFCS is 377 105 206 939 (179) kHz, within the
error bars of the corresponding one-photon DFCS result.
We note that for all measurements reported in the paper,
the statistical errors (one standard deviation of the mean)
associated with 5P3/2 are signiﬁcantly smaller than those
associated with 5P1/2. This is due to the stronger transi-
tion strength and less severe optical pumping eﬀects for
5P3/2 F=3 (part of a closed transition), leading to larger
signal-to-noise ratios.

In conclusion, a phase-stabilized femtosecond comb
has been used as an eﬀective tool to perform direct
spectroscopy of one- and two-photon transitions in cold
87Rb atoms. We have demonstrated that DFCS can be
successfully applied to one-photon studies, by measur-
ing 5S1/2 → 5P1/2,3/2 transitions both directly and in-
directly, via their resonant enhancement of the 5S-5D
two-photon transitions. Additionally, we have shown the
importance of including the dynamic population changes
arising from pulse-accumulated population transfer in
this indirect one-photon measurement. Finally, we have
demonstrated that by using DFCS, the absolute value of
the 5S1/2 → 7S1/2 two-photon transitions in 87Rb is con-
clusively determined, with no a priori knowledge about
their optical frequency.

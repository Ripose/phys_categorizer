It has been shown in an earlier publication [1] that magnetic ﬁeld gradients applied to particles in
traps can induce Larmor frequency shifts that may falsely be interpreted as electric-dipole moment
(EDM) signals. This study has now been extended to include nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld gradients
due to the presence of a local magnetic dipole. It is found that the magnitude of the eﬀect can be
enhanced beyond the simple expectation of proportionality to the volume-averaged magnetic-ﬁeld
gradient h∂Bz/∂zi.

INTRODUCTION

Measurements of particle intrinsic electric dipole mo-
ments (EDMs) are important because of the tight con-
straints that they impose upon theories that attempt to
explain the origin of CP violation. Such measurements
are generally made by applying to the particles of inter-
est uniform static electric and magnetic ﬁelds that are, in
turn, parallel and antiparallel to one another. The Lar-
mor precession frequency is measured, and any shift in
frequency observed upon reversal of the electric ﬁeld may
ideally be attributed to an electric dipole moment. How-
ever, when making such measurements, great care must
be taken to avoid systematic uncertainties from a variety
of sources. One of the most important of these is the so-
called ~v × ~E eﬀect, arising from the Lorentz transforma-
tion into the particle’s rest frame of the laboratory-frame
electric ﬁeld:

We consider here the case of particles stored in a trap
with vertical (z) applied magnetic and electric ﬁelds ~B0
and ~E. The particles are moving slowly enough that the
Lorentz factor γL in Eq. 1 may be taken to be unity. The
radial magnetic ﬁeld components associated with a verti-
cal gradient ∂B0/∂z act in conjunction with the motion-
induced ﬁeld of Eq. 1 to produce a net rotating magnetic
ﬁeld of frequency ωr, which then shifts the Larmor fre-
quency (initially ω0) of the trapped particles. The in-
duced shift is proportional to the applied electric ﬁeld,
and thus mimics the signal of an electric-dipole moment.
Earlier publications [1, 2] have analysed this geometric-
phase eﬀect in some detail.

There are two separate situations to consider: ﬁrst, the
nearly adiabatic case of a slowly orbiting particle, |ωr| <
|ω0|; and second, the non-adiabatic case of |ωr| > |ω0|.

Eq. 34 of [1] shows that, for any shape of magnetic
ﬁeld, in the nearly adiabatic case the false EDM signal is

where vxy is the velocity of the particle in the xy (horizon-
tal) plane, ω∗
r is the value of ωr weighted appropriately
to account for the populations of the various orbits, and
the magnetic ﬁeld gradient h∂B0z/∂ziV is averaged over
the storage volume V .

The corresponding expression for the non-adiabatic
case of |ωr| > |ω0| (Eq. 37 of [1]), for a uniform gra-
dient ∂B0/∂z and a cylindrical storage volume of radius
R, is

where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and ω†
r is, as before,
an appropriately weighted value of ωr. It remained an
open question in [1] as to whether the false EDM signal
daf would always be proportional to the volume-averaged
ﬁeld gradient h∂B0/∂ziV in the regime |ωr| > |ω0|. In
this study we show, by counter-example, that it is not.

II. GEOMETRIC PHASE ENHANCEMENT

In the non-adiabatic case, the rate of addition of geo-
metric phase is proportional to the radial component Br
of the magnetic ﬁeld. For a uniform gradient this is given
by

The average Br over a circular region of radius R in this
case is therefore related to the average gradient h∂B0/∂zi
by

We now consider the eﬀect of a point magnetic dipole
aligned along the z axis. The average radial magnetic
ﬁeld component hBri over a circular region of radius R
at a height z above the dipole is

hBri =

h∂B0/∂zi over the same region is

This is clearly enhanced by a factor (1 + R2/z2) beyond
the relation of Eq. 5, and the expression (3) above for the
geometric-phase-induced false EDM signal would there-
fore be expected to be enhanced by the same factor, with
appropriate averaging over the range of z.

This eﬀect has been studied with a numerical simu-
lation, using a storage volume of height 12 cm and ra-
dius 23.5 cm (corresponding to the conﬁguration of the
neutron EDM experiment at the Institut Laue-Langevin,
Grenoble). The results for several values of the distance
z1 of the dipole below the ﬂoor of the storage volume are
shown in Table I.

Up to an enhancement factor of about two, the the
simulation and the z-averaged prediction of Eq. 8 agree
to within a few percent. However, when the dipole is

2

in close proximity, the enhancement factor is seen to be
suppressed relative to the analytic prediction. We do not
have a quantitative explanation of the underlying mech-
anism for this reduction; however, it is believed to be due
to the rapidly changing magnitude of the radial magnetic
ﬁeld component. As the dipole approaches the storage
volume, Br becomes much more localised compared to
size of the radius of the cell R. Under these conditions
the moving particles see more of the amplitude Br being
assigned to higher harmonics of the particle orbit fre-
quency. As these are further away from the (relatively
low) Larmor frequency ω0, they are less eﬀective in pro-
ducing a frequency shift, and the enhancement is thereby
suppressed.

The adiabatic case was also simulated with the same
magnetic-dipole ﬁeld environment. No departure from
Eq. 2 was observed.

III. CONCLUSION

At current and future anticipated levels of sensitiv-
ity, geometric-phase-induced false EDM signals are an
important potential source of systematic errors in EDM
measurements.
It has been shown in this Report that
non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld gradients can, in the non-
adiabatic case |ωr| > |ω0|, result in an enhancement of
the false EDM signal above and beyond that anticipated
by a simple dependence upon the volume-averaged gra-
dient. A simple formula has been derived for the situ-
ation of a dipole aligned with the symmetry axis of the
storage volume; however, this formula overestimates the
enhancement when the dipole is in close proximity to the
bottle, and at the current level of understanding it ap-
pears to be necessary to rely upon numerical simulations
to obtain accurate predictions of this eﬀect.

We report a precise search for correlation eﬀects in linear
chains of 2 and 3 trapped Ca+ ions. Unexplained correlations
in photon emission times within a linear chain of trapped ions
have been reported, which, if genuine, cast doubt on the po-
tential of an ion trap to realize quantum information process-
ing. We observe quantum jumps from the metastable 3d2D5/2
level for several hours, searching for correlations between the
decay times of the diﬀerent ions. We ﬁnd no evidence for cor-
relations: the number of quantum jumps with separations of
less than 10 ms is consistent with statistics to within errors
of 0.05%; the lifetime of the metastable level derived from
the data is consistent with that derived from independent
single-ion data at the level of the experimental errors (1%);
and no rank correlations between the decay times were found
with sensitivity to rank correlation coeﬃcients at the level of
|R| = 0.024.

The drive to realise the potential of quantum informa-
tion processing [1,2] has led to the investigation of various
experimental systems; among these is the ion trap, which
has several advantages including the capability to gener-
ate entanglement actively with existing technology [3].
Following the proposal of an ion-trap quantum processor
by Cirac and Zoller [4], several groups have carried out
pioneering experiments [5–9]. In a recent review [10], the
view was expressed that “the ion trap proposal for realiz-
ing a practical quantum computer oﬀers the best chance
of long term success.” One of the attractive features of
the trap is that the various interactions and processes
which govern its behaviour have been exhaustively stud-
ied and are in principle well-understood. However, 14
years ago unexplained collective behaviour when several
ions were present was reported [11], and recently a further
account of such eﬀects has appeared [12]. They manifest
themselves as an enhanced rate of coincident quantum
jumps.

Sauter et al. [11] measured two- and three-fold coinci-
dent quantum jumps in a system of three trapped Ba+
ions to occur two orders of magnitude more frequently
than expected on the basis of statistics. This observa-
tion led to proposals that the ions were undergoing a
collective interaction with the light ﬁeld [11,13].

More recently, Block et al. [12] have observed an en-

hanced rate of two- and three-fold coincidences in a linear
chain of ten Ca+ ions, where the coincidences were not
conﬁned to adjacent ions. This led them to suggest an
unexplained long range interaction between ions in the
linear crystal. They also found that measurements of
the lifetime τ of the 3D5/2 level (shelved state) from the
10-ion string produced discrepancies of as much as 6σ be-
tween runs under nominally identical conditions, where
σ is the standard deviation for each run.

Since only the electromagnetic interaction is involved,
it is extremely unlikely that these observations indicate
new physics; nevertheless, they raise serious doubt about
the suitability of the ion trap as a quantum information
processing device. We have therefore undertaken a new
and precise search for such eﬀects in linear chains of 2
and 3 trapped Ca+ ions.

Our data were taken under conditions such that cor-
relation eﬀects would be expected on the basis of the
results of [11] and [12], and are signiﬁcantly more precise
than either. We ﬁnd no evidence at all for correlations,
as described below.

The experimental method is very similar to that re-
ported in our measurement of the lifetime of the 3d2D5/2
level [14], which was originally adopted by Block et al.
[12]. Linear crystals of a small number, N , of 40Ca+ ions
separated by about 15 µm are obtained by trapping in
a linear Paul trap in vacuo (< 2 × 10−11 mbar), and
laser-cooling the ions to a few mK. The transitions of in-
terest are shown in ﬁgure 1. Laser beams at 397 nm and
866 nm continuously illuminate the ions, and the ﬂuores-
cence at 397 nm is detected by a photomultiplier. The
photon count signal is accumulated for bins of duration
tb = 10.01 ms (of which the last 2.002 ms is dead time),
and logged. A laser at 850 nm drives the 3D3/2 − 4P3/2
transition. The most probable decay route from 4P3/2 is
to the 4S1/2 ground state; alternatively, an ion can re-
turn to 3D3/2. However, about 1 decay in 18 occurs to
3D5/2, the metastable “shelving” level. At this point the
ﬂuorescence from the ion that has been shelved disap-
pears. A shutter on the 850 nm laser beam remains open
for 100 ms before it is closed, which gives ample time for
shelving of all N ions. Between 5 and 10 ms after the
shutter is closed we start to record the photomultiplier
count signal in the 10 ms bins. We keep observing the
photon count until it abruptly increases to a level above

1

a threshold. This is set between the levels observed when
1 and 0 ions remain shelved. The signature for all N ions
having decayed is taken to be ten consecutive bins above
this threshold. After this we re-open the shutter on the
850 nm laser. This process is repeated for several hours,
which constitutes one run.

The data from a given run were analysed as follows.
The raw data consists of counts indicating the average
ﬂuorescence level in each bin of duration tb (see ﬁgure
2). N thresholds λm are set, the mth threshold being
set between the levels observed when m and (m − 1)
ions remain shelved. The number of bins observed below
λN gives the decay time, tN , of the ﬁrst of N shelved
ions to decay. The number of bins observed between
λm+1 and λm being exceeded gives the decay time, tm,
of the next ion to decay leaving (m − 1) ions shelved.
The large number of tm obtained are then gathered into
separate histograms and the expected exponential dis-
tribution A exp (−γmt) is ﬁtted to each, in order to de-
rive the decay rate γm of the next ion to decay leaving
(m − 1) ions shelved (see ﬁgure 3).
It is appropriate
to use a Poissonian ﬁtting method (described in [14]),
rather than least-squares, because of the small numbers
involved in part of the distribution (at large t).

If the N ions are acting independently, each one will
have a decay rate γ = 1/τ , where τ is the lifetime of
the 3D5/2 state. Since we do not distinguish between the
ﬂuorescence signals from the diﬀerent ions, then with m
ions remaining shelved the next decay is characterised by
the increased rate γm = m/τ .

Figure 3 shows the histogram of the decay times, t1,
of the second ion of two to decay obtained from a 3.2
hour run. The expected exponential decay ﬁts the data
very well. Events in the ﬁrst bin of the histogram cor-
respond to both ions being detected as decaying in the
same bin, t1 = 0. These quantum jumps, coincident
within our time resolution, certainly do not occur two
orders of magnitude more frequently than expected by
random coincidence as was observed by Sauter et al. [11].
In fact, they are observed to occur less frequently than
predicted by the ﬁtted exponential to the histogram data.
However, this is an artefact of our ﬁnite time resolution.
The ﬁtted exponential to the histogram data has value
f1 in the ﬁrst bin, which gives the number of second ion
decays that are expected to occur within tb of the ﬁrst
ion decaying by random coincidence. However, for both
ions to decay within a single bin, the second ion has an
average time of less than tb in which to decay. The exact
details depend upon the analysis thresholds, λm, and the
detector dead time. In the 2-ion case, one can show that,
to ﬁrst order in tb/τ , the ﬁrst bin width is modiﬁed to
F tb where:

F = 0.98− 0.8λ′
with normalized thresholds:

1 + 0.16λ′

1 = 1.4 and λ′

where Sm is the mean photon count with m ions shelved
(so SN is the mean background count level). This ex-
pression was veriﬁed using real and simulated data. The
expected number of coincidences is therefore F f1. For
the histogram shown, the 2-ion data was analyzed with
the thresholds λ′
2 = 0.40 (these are chosen
to optimize the discrimination of the ﬂuorescence lev-
els Sm), which gives F = 0.42. The expected number

of coincidences is F f1 = 24 ± 5, assuming √n errors,

which agrees with the observed number of coincidences,
26. The second bin of the histogram is the only other
bin expected to have a modiﬁed width, which is by a
negligible amount. Note that, to ensure the number of
coincidences is properly normalized, it is important that
only events where at least (m+1) ions were shelved at the
start of an observation are included in the tm histogram
(for m 6= N ).
Table I shows that the observed number of 2-fold co-
incidences in the 2- and 3-ion data agree with the ex-
pected value within √n errors. The total expected num-
ber of 2-fold coincidences in all the data was 66.3 out
of 16132 quantum jumps observed to start with at least
2 ions shelved. We are therefore sensitive to changes
in the proportion of 2-fold coincidences at the level of
√66/16132 = 0.05% or about 1 event per hour.

The expected number of 3-fold coincidences depends
on the threshold settings in a more complex way than
in the 2-fold case, and here we simply use simulated 3-
ion data to provide the predicted number of 3-fold co-
incidences shown in table I. The total number of ex-
pected 3-fold coincidences is 0.05 in both 3-ion data runs,
which have a combined duration of 2.8 hrs. In fact, this
predicted value is signiﬁcantly lower than eﬀects in our
trap which can perturb the system suﬃciently to cause
de-shelving (such as collisions with residual background
gas), as discussed in [14]. We observe at most one event,
depending on the exact choice of threshold settings, and
this does not constitute evidence for correlation.

The decay rates obtained from the 2- and 3-ion data
are shown in ﬁgure 4, where the horizontal lines are the
expected rates γm = m/τ assuming the ions to act in-
dependently. Combining all the γm derived from the
2- and 3-ion data as estimates of m/τ yields a value
τ = 1177± 10 ms, where we include a 2 ms allowance for
systematic error [14]. This is consistent with the value
derived from single-ion data, τ = 1168 ± 7 ms [14]. We
are therefore sensitive to changes in the apparent value
of τ due to multiple ion eﬀects at the level of 1%. Super-
ﬂuorescence and subﬂuorescence as observed in a two ion
crystal [15] are calculated to be negligible with the large
interionic distance of about 15 µm in the chain.

In order to look for more general forms of correlation
between the decay times of each ion, rank correlation

2

tests were performed. Table II gives the results; they
show no signiﬁcant correlations. The 2-ion data is the
most sensitive, allowing underlying rank-correlation co-
eﬃcients to be ruled out at the level of |R12| = 0.024.
In summary, we have presented results that are consis-
tent with no correlations of spontaneous decay within lin-
ear chains of 2 and 3 trapped Ca+ ions, contrary to pre-
vious studies. First, the number of coincident quantum
jumps were found to be consistent with those expected
from random coincidence at the level of 0.05%. Second,
the exponential decay expected assuming the ions to act
independently ﬁtted the histogram of decay times tm ob-
tained from the 2- and 3-ion data well. Third, the decay
rates from these ﬁts were combined to estimate the life-
time of the shelved state, giving a result consistent with
our previous precise measurement performed on a single
ion [14]. Fourth, rank correlation tests were performed
on the decay times obtained from the 2- and 3-ion data;
no evidence for rank correlation was found.

We suggest therefore that the correlations which have
been reported are likely to be due not to interactions
between the ions themselves, but to external time-
dependent perturbations. In our own trap, we have in-
vestigated and reduced such perturbations to a negligible
level [14], and the present work demonstrates that when
this is done there is no evidence that an ion trap is subject
to unexplained eﬀects which would make it unsuitable for
quantum information processing.

In this case, the analysis gave A = 57 ± 1,
γ1 = 0.860 ± 0.012 s−1, which agrees with the expected rate
γ1 = 1/τ = 0.856 ± 0.005 s−1, where τ is the lifetime de-

an expanded scale, in the form (data−ﬁt)/√ﬁt. The ﬁrst bin

gives the number of 2-ion jumps observed to be coincident
within one counting bin and has a modiﬁed bin width (see
text), which reduces the expected number in the ﬁrst bin to
be F = 0.42 of the value, f1 = 57, predicted by the ﬁtted

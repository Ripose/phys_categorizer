Abstract: We perform metastability exchange optical pumping of helium-3 in a strong magnetic
ﬁeld of 1.5 T. The achieved nuclear polarizations, from 80% at 1.33 mbar to 25% at 67 mbar, show
a substantial improvement at high pressures with respect to standard low-ﬁeld optical pumping.
The speciﬁc mechanisms of metastability exchange optical pumping at high ﬁeld are investigated,
advantages and intrinsic limitations are discussed. From a practical point of view, our results open
the way to alternative technological solutions for polarized helium-3 applications and in particular
for magnetic resonance imaging of human lungs.

A gas of ground state 3He atoms in which a high degree
of nuclear polarization is achieved oﬀers an incredibly
rich playground in various ﬁelds of science from statis-
tical or nuclear physics to biophysics and medicine [1].
Depending on the targeted application, the degree of nu-
clear polarization, the sample density or the production
rate of polarized atoms should be optimized. A recent
application which may have an important impact in the
diagnosis of pulmonary diseases is polarized gas magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) [2]. Clinical studies to demon-
strate the relevance of this new tool are under way in the
United States and in Europe. Yet, if a wide expertise
exists in MRI to adapt the existing imaging techniques
to the case of polarized gases, the gas preparation re-
mains a critical stage to be transferred from physics lab-
oratories to hospitals. Two methods are presently used
to polarize 3He: spin-exchange with optically pumped al-
kali atoms [3] and pure-He metastability exchange optical
pumping (MEOP) [4]. In standard conditions, MEOP is
performed at low pressures (1 mbar) in a guiding mag-
netic ﬁeld of the order of 1 mT. Circularly polarized
light at 1083 nm corresponding to the 23S-23P transi-
tion of He is used to transfer angular momentum to the
atoms and nuclear polarization is created by hyperﬁne
coupling in the metastable 23S state. Through metasta-
bility exchange collisions nuclear polarization builds up
in the ground state 3He atoms. The eﬃciency of MEOP
in standard conditions rapidly decreases if the pressure
of the sample exceeds a few mbar (insert in Fig.6-a)
[5, 6, 7]. Therefore a delicate polarization-preserving
compression stage is necessary for MRI in which the gas
should be at atmospheric pressure and for all applications
needing a dense sample. In this letter, we show that a
strong magnetic ﬁeld of 1.5 T improves the eﬃciency of
MEOP with respect to standard low-ﬁeld optical pump-
ing. At 1 mbar, we easily obtain 80% of nuclear polar-
ization with much lighter experimental constraints. At
higher pressures, the achieved nuclear polarizations are

dramatically increased. This indicates that a relaxation
channel which severely limits the eﬃciency of MEOP at
high pressure is inhibited at high ﬁeld. Optical pump-
ing at high magnetic ﬁeld and high pressure could thus
constitute an attractive option for applications.

Experiments are performed in the bore of the 1.5 T
superconducting magnet of a clinical MRI system. The
experimental apparatus is sketched in Fig.1. The helium
gas is enclosed in a sealed cylindrical Pyrex cell (diame-
ter 5 cm, length 5 cm). Four cells ﬁlled with 1.33 mbar,
8 mbar, 32 mbar and 67 mbar of pure 3He are used. A
radio-frequency discharge at 3 MHz sustained by exter-
nal electrodes is used to maintain the metastable atoms
density nm in the range 1010-1011atoms/cm3, depending
on the discharge intensity, at all pressures. The opti-
cal pumping laser is either a 50 mW single mode laser
diode ampliﬁed to 0.5 W or a 2 W broadband ﬁber laser
(1.63 GHz FWHM). The slightly divergent pump beam

reaches a diameter of about 1 cm FWHM in the cell.
It is back-reﬂected to enhance its absorption and col-
lected by a photodiode to monitor its tuning to atomic
resonance. A single mode laser diode is used as a weak
probe beam to measure the nuclear polarization.
It is
linearly polarized perpendicularly to the magnetic ﬁeld
(σ polarization). The discharge intensity is modulated
at 133 Hz and the probe absorption is measured with a
lock-in ampliﬁer. Laser sources and all the electronics
remain several meters away from the magnet bore in a
low-ﬁeld region.

At 1.5 T the energy levels of the 23S and 23P states
are spread over 80 and 160 GHz respectively due to Zee-
man splitting (Fig.2). We note mJ , mI , mF the mag-
netic quantum numbers for the electronic, nuclear, and
total angular momentum. In the 23S state the sublevels
are arranged into three pairs of quasi-degenerate levels
of increasing energy (SL, SM, and SH), that correspond
respectively to mJ =−1, 0, and 1 in the completely de-

2

coupled limit B → ∞.
In fact at 1.5 T hyperﬁne de-
coupling in the 23S state is already important so that
the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian show only little mix-
ing of the order of ǫ=1% between diﬀerent eigenstates
|mJ , mI i of the decoupled system. Optical pumping was
found to be the most eﬃcient with a σ−-polarized pump
laser tuned to simultaneously depopulate four metastable
sublevels (Fig.2). These transitions have a total oscilla-
tor strength close to 4, which guarantees strong pump
laser absorption in contrast with the low-ﬁeld situation
where the most eﬃcient (C8 and C9) optical pumping
transitions have a weak oscillator strength (0.29 and 0.37
respectively). The atoms are pumped into the pair SH
by the following sequence: laser excitation, collisional re-
distribution in the 23P state and spontaneous emission.
The ground state nuclear polarization M is deﬁned as
M =(n+ − n−)/(n+ + n−) where n+ and n− denote pop-
ulations of the mI =1/2 and mI =−1/2 nuclear spin states
respectively. In the absence of optical pumping, metasta-
bility exchange collisions impose a spin temperature dis-
tribution for the 23S sublevel populations, proportional
to eβmF where M =(eβ − 1)/(eβ + 1). To measure M , we
probe the populations of the two mF =1/2 and mF =3/2
states that are not addressed by the pump. By sweeping
the probe laser frequency, the corresponding spectra are
recorded both for M =0 and for optically-pumped steady-
state situations. The spin temperature and the nuclear
polarization are inferred from the relative heights of the
peaks before and after optical pumping (Fig.3-a). By
tuning the probe laser frequency on the mF =3/2 line, we
can monitor the build-up of the polarization, as well as
its decay when the pump is turned oﬀ (Fig.3-b). These
measurement procedures operate in arbitrary magnetic
ﬁeld and pressure [8].

In Fig.4, we present results on the steady-state polar-
ization M and on the polarization build-up time constant
tb in the 1.33 mbar cell as a function of the discharge in-
tensity characterized by the polarization decay time T1.
We distinguish two regimes: weak and strong discharges.
In weak discharges (T1 ≥ 300 s), the achieved polariza-
tion with the broadband 2 W laser is high, about 80%
independently of T1. The polarization build-up is how-
ever quite slow (tb ranging from 60 to 350 s). In strong
discharges, build-up is much faster (tb ranging from 15
to 55 s) although the steady-state polarization is lower.
Fig.5 shows the inﬂuence of the pump laser power PL
for a given discharge (T1 = 300 s). A power as low as
0.5 W is suﬃcient for the polarization and the build up
time to almost reach their asymptotic values. Signal to
noise ratio is better than 103 and the estimated error on
the steady-state polarization is ≤ 2%. Yet, scatter of
results is of the order of ±10% over several runs for the
same parameters. This is attributed to plasma condi-
tions that are diﬃcult to exactly reproduce in high ﬁeld.
Similar studies of optical pumping dynamics have been
performed at higher pressures. Selected results for one

The polarization build-up time weakly depends on 3He
pressure, in contrast with low-ﬁeld situations [6, 9].

The speciﬁc mechanisms of optical pumping at 1.5 T
can be used to account for the observed dynamics. The
metastability exchange rate γe for a 23S atom is of the
order of 3.75 × 106 s−1/mbar [8] while the optical pump-

ing rate γp is limited by laser power and ultimately by
optical saturation and the 23P state ﬁnite decay rate γ
=107 s−1. In our experimental conditions, metastability
exchange is the dominant process as far as time scales
are concerned. However due to electronic spin conserva-
tion, metastability exchange collisions essentially couple
sublevels within each pair SL, SM or SH and a relatively
weak optical pumping beam (e.g. γp ≥ ǫγe) can eﬃ-
ciently transfer population from the pairs SL and SM to
the pair SH. Assuming full pumping of atoms into the
pair SH, each metastability exchange collision transfers
either one unit of angular momentum to the ground state
from the mF =3/2 state or (ǫ-1) unit of angular momen-
tum from the mF =1/2 state. One infers tb = 2Te/ǫ where
1/Te is the metastability exchange collision rate for a 3He
atom in the ground state, proportional to the metastable
atoms density. At 300 K, 1/Te=1.53×10−10cm3/s×nm,
yielding tb in the range 13-130 s. This prediction is in
good agreement with our experimental results and indi-
cates (i) that the dynamics of optical pumping at 1.5 T
is indeed intrinsically limited by hyperﬁne decoupling
and (ii) that the build-up times should not vary with
gas pressure. At low pressure, our production rates of
polarized atoms per unit volume Rp=P ×M/tb are lower
with respect to standard low-ﬁeld optical pumping. Nev-
ertheless we can take advantage of the weak pressure de-
pendence of M and tb at 1.5 T to eﬃciently perform
MEOP at higher pressure. In Table I, the obtained rates
Rp for data from Fig.6 are listed with published results
for standard low-ﬁeld conditions and in similar sealed
cells. By raising the pressure from 1.33 to 32 mbar, a

factor 10 is gained for Rp and fair production rates are
recovered. For instance, gas in a 250 cc cell at 32 mbar
can be polarized at 40% in 3 minutes. After compression
to atmospheric pressure, it is a right amount of gas for
imaging the lungs of a guinea pig. For human lung MRI
gas accumulation is necessary. Optical pumping at 32
or 67 mbar would considerably simplify the compression
stage by reducing the compression ratio from 1:1000 to
1:31 or 1:15. An important point holding at any pres-
sure is that with the large Zeeman splitting in the 23S-
23P transition, the magnetic sublevels involved in optical
pumping are selected by light frequency and not only by
polarization. The high-ﬁeld optical pumping scheme is
therefore extremely robust against polarization impurity
of the pumping light. This is a crucial issue for massive
production of polarized 3He using high laser power, since
unwanted polarization would severely limit achieved po-
larization at low ﬁeld [10].

could be an attractive choice.

Abstract

An interest for the low-energy range of the nonextensive distribution function arises from the

study of radiative recombination in electron cooling devices in particle accelerators, whose experi-

mentally measured reaction rates are much above the theoretical prediction. The use of generalized

distributions, that diﬀer from the Maxwellian in the low energy part (due to subdiﬀusion between

electron and ion bunches), may account for the observed rate enhancement.

In this work, we

consider the isotropic distribution function and we propose a possible experiment for verifying the

existence of a cut-oﬀ in the generalized momentum distribution, by measuring the spectrum of the

X-rays emitted from radiative recombination reactions.

INTRODUCTION

In the ﬁeld of accelerator physics the request for cold beams, with low energy spread and

emittance, is an important issue. The electron cooling technique, suggested by Budker in

1966, has been largely used for this purpose [1]. Nevertheless, the coexistence of positive ions

and electrons leads to a certain amount of recombinations, and the study of this phenomenon

has encountered a problem that is not completely solved up to now, i.e.

the radiative

recombination enhancement at low relative energy.

On the other hand, the nonextensive statistical mechanics has been successfully applied

so far to various ﬁelds of physics, for instance in the study of astrophysical plasmas. Here we

show the possible application of generalized statistics to radiative recombination; the results

obtained go indeed into the right direction to account for the measured enhancement.

In the following sections we brieﬂy summarize the electron cooling technique and radiative

recombination, then propose the use of a superextensive distribution instead of a Maxwellian

function in the calculation of the recombination rate because of the presence of correlations

and/or random and memory eﬀects among the particles, and ﬁnally we present theoretical

rates from an isotropic distribution. Justiﬁcations and suggestions for experimental tests are

also given to conﬁrm the existence of a cut-oﬀ in the momentum distribution which, among

all the generalized functions recently proposed, appears only in the Tsallis distribution.

II. COOLING AND RECOMBINATION

Liouville’s theorem forbids the reduction of beam emittance by use of optical methods;

therefore, external dissipative forces must be applied in order to overcome this huge problem

in devices like a storage ring, where the high number of cycles would result in a heavy beam

quality loss. In 1966, Budker suggested to overlap the beam of interest with a colder electron

one, and to exploit Coulomb scattering in order to carry away the energy excess in the hot

ion component. Shortly afterwards, devices built for this purpose proved the eﬃciency of

the method.

Although their cross sections are orders of magnitude smaller, various phenomena can

occur aside of Coulomb elastic scattering, such as ion excitation, ionization and several

2

atomic recombination mechanisms, among which lies the radiative recombination,

AZ+ + e− → A(Z−1)+ + hν ,

where an electron goes from free to bound state, and the energy excess is released through

X-rays. Several experiments with bare ions (three-body processes like dielectronic recombi-

nation are forbidden) show an unexpected feature: when the relative velocity of electron-ion

bunches approaches zero, the radiative recombination rate increases more than theoretically

predicted on the basis of the calculated cross section and anisotropic Maxwellian distribu-

tion [2].

where E1s is the Rydberg energy, Ek is the electron kinetic energy in the electron-ion center-

of-mass frame and Z is the nuclear charge of the atom. A further quantum mechanical

correction may be introduced via the so-called Gaunt factor gn (Ek), that is convenient as

there are parametrizations or tables for its values.

The total cross section is obtained by summing the function in Eq. 1 over all the ac-

cessible values of n (often a proper upper limit nmax is chosen); furthermore, a suitable

parametrization of the total cross section yields

σtot (ε) = σ1s (ε) s (ε) ,

(2)

where ε = Ek
E1s

and s (ε) is a function of ε evaluated numerically [3].

The recombination rate is then deﬁned as an average of the cross section in Eq. 2 either

over the distribution functions of the two beams, or a distribution function of their relative

velocity and, if we consider an already cooled ion beam, we can reduce ourselves to the

average over the electron distribution f (v) alone; thus, the deﬁnition becomes

αRR = hvσtot (v)i =

d3v vσtot (v) f (v) .

Usually, an anisotropic Maxwellian distribution is considered: in the transverse plane the

function is isotropic, whereas longitudinally the width (temperature) of the distribution is

diﬀerent. The distribution then reads

The two temperatures Tk and T⊥ are the typical parameters deﬁning the experimental

conditions; their values are around tens of meV for T⊥ (strongly determined by the voltage

at which the thermocathode that produces the electron cloud operates) and two or three

orders of magnitude lower for Tk.

A clear example of recombination enhancement (showing a value up to 5.2 at zero relative

energy) is the experiment with Bi83+ ions, performed in the ESR at GSI [4].

There are various interpretations of the enhancement: for the authors of Ref. [5], energy,

due to the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, is transferred from the longitudinal to the transverse

motion and therefore there is an increase in the time spent by the electron in proximity to

the ion, enhancing the recombination probability.

Furthermore, a work by Heerlein, Zwicknagel and Toepﬀer [6] takes into account the eﬀect

of the external ﬁelds, considered as the cause of enhancement, suggesting that this arises

from a ﬁeld-driven process, i.e. electrons that acquire negative energy upon the merging

of the electron and ion beams, because of the presence of the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld that

permits the bending of the cooling electrons onto the trajectory of the ion beam; the magnet

separates the loosely bound electrons of the most outer atomic levels, so that these can

yield an additional recombination channel; hence, we have to count not only free-bound

transitions, but also bound-bound transitions. See Ref. [7] for criticisms to this explanation.

So far, no complete theory has been proposed, anyway, and scaling laws for the enhance-

ment require ﬁtting upon experimental data; on the contrary, we suggest an alternative

approach based on a self-consistent thermostatistical framework, namely the nonextensive

statistical mechanics, where the key idea is the use of a deformed distribution function.

III. NON-MAXWELLIAN APPROACH: ISOTROPIC CASE

The nonextensive statistical mechanics, introduced by Tsallis in the last two decades, can

be seen as a generalization of Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics; the Tsallis distribution function

reads

fq (v) = Bq

1 − (1 − q)
(cid:20)
where q is the nonextensivity index, Bq is the normalization factor and Tq = 2

5−3q TM B is
the q-temperature, that must be used every time we want to relate Boltzmann and Tsallis

statistics [8].

The distinctive feature of the q-distribution is that when q > 1 (subextensivity and

superdiﬀusion), fq shows a lower peak at v = 0 with respect to the Maxwellian function fM B,

while the tail at higher velocities is increased; for q < 1 (superextensivity and subdiﬀusion),

the situation is the other way round: fq is higher-peaked and narrower, so that the high-
velocity tail is accordingly depleted, and a cut-oﬀ appears at Ecut = kBT
1−q .

Since the radiative recombination cross section shows a peak for v → 0, while the particles

in the tail have scarcely an inﬂuence, a superextensive distribution, increasing the number

of particles around the zero-energy point, leads to an increase in αRR. This is calculated

according to the following formula:

αRR

q = hhvσtot (v)iiq =

d3vf q

q (v) vσtot (v)

Two important remarks: ﬁrst, we adopted an isotropic distribution function because the

q-distribution cannot be rigorously factorized; therefore, coherently, we shall compare it with

. In Fig. 2 we plot the ratio R as a function of the dimensionless temperature

in the case of an electron-positron system. The curve shows that actually, as

q → 0, a recombination enhancement appears.

Second, our calculations show that the recombination rate is almost the same for both

Maxwellian and Tsallis distribution functions at the same temperature; the major inﬂuence

on the enhancement is therefore the temperature alteration given by q in the Tq deﬁnition.

IV. JUSTIFICATIONS, TESTING AND GEDANKEN EXPERIMENT

Many studies demonstrated that there exists a set of non-Maxwellian distribution func-

tions that are stationary solutions of dynamical equations [9]. For example, when a statis-

tical system of particles is subjected to external random forces or electric ﬁelds (condition

that also applies to radiative recombination in electron cooling devices) the actual func-

tional dependence on energy of its distribution function relies strongly on the microscopical

interaction acting among the ions. It was shown, in particular, that an interaction cross

6

section roughly constant with energy naturally leads to the Tsallis distribution that was

used throughout this paper [10].

Moreover, the presence of a cut-oﬀ in a distribution function is not a completely new

feature: already in 1940, Spitzer imposed a cut-oﬀ to the Maxwellian distribution in order

to explain the stability of galaxy clusters despite the escape velocity eﬀect [11]. Furthermore,

a theoretical explanation of the cut-oﬀ was given by relating it to a ﬁnite heat reservoir [12].

Many experimental results show how the rate coeﬃcient behaves as a function of Erel.

Among others, C 6+, F 6+, Ne10+ and Bi83+ ion beams have been used [2, 5, 13]. All ex-

periments indicate that, respect to Erel, the rate coeﬃcient decreases much faster than the

Maxwellian one calculated at a temperature Tq lower than the Maxwellian TM B, in spite of

the fact that at Erel = 0 the Maxwellian rate at Tq satisfactorily approximates the exper-

imental result. Only imposing a cut-oﬀ in the momentum distribution we can reproduce,

for Erel

6= 0, the experimental behaviour (see Fig. 1). The previous argument actually

represents an eﬀective test that a cut-oﬀ naturally exists in the momentum distribution.

A further possible test to verify the presence of a superextensive distribution would be the

observation of the recombination X-ray spectrum. A measured cut-oﬀ energy Ecut, beyond

which there are no electrons, would indeed imply the presence of a corresponding cut-oﬀ in

the energy spectrum of the radiation emitted from recombination: the maximum observable

energy might thus be

Emax

spectrum = Ecut + E1s ,

since E1s is the largest binding energy. See Ref. [14] for a detailed description of the X-

ray spectrum measurements, which could be possible in the future. But, since this kind

of measurements are out of the present experimental eﬃciency, this remains a gedanken

experiment.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In order to explain the atomic recombination rate coeﬃcient measured in electron cool-

ing devices in storage rings (of a factor up to 5 greater than its Maxwellian evaluation) we

must consider that correlations and memory eﬀects in addition to dissipative and random

eﬀects in the electron gas impose, for its description, the use of a deformed momentum dis-

tribution function. The superextensive Tsallis distribution seems to be appropriate, among

7

many other diﬀerent deformed distributions proposed, because, among other reasons, this

distribution contains an energy cut-oﬀ we would expect as a consequence of our previous

considerations.

The presence of cut-oﬀ results by examining the experimental measurements of the rate

at relative energies diﬀerent from the very low relative energy region. This fact is a test of

the validity, in this particular situation, of the Tsallis nonextensive thermostatistics.

A calculation valid to all orders in the nuclear-strength parameter is presented for the two-loop Lamb shift,
notably for the two-loop self-energy correction, to the 2p -2s transition energies in heavy Li-like ions. The
calculation removes the largest theoretical uncertainty for these transitions and yields the ﬁrst experimental
identiﬁcation of two-loop QED effects in the region of the strong binding ﬁeld.

The Coulomb ﬁeld of heavy nuclei provides a unique op-
portunity for testing the strong-ﬁeld regime of bound-state
quantum electrodynamics (QED). The most obvious candi-
date for such a test is an H-like ion, whose theoretical descrip-
tion is the simplest one. Measurements of the 1s Lamb shift
in H-like uranium, the heaviest naturally occurring element,
have recently achieved an accuracy of 4.6 eV [1]. This cor-
responds to a fractional accuracy of 1.7% with respect to the
total 1s QED contribution. Such measurements yield a test of
bound-state QED at the one-loop level (i.e., to ﬁrst order in
the ﬁne structure constant α), but they are yet insensitive to
the two-loop QED corrections, which are of primary theoreti-
cal interest at present.

By contrast, measurements of the 2p-2s transition energies
in heavy Li-like ions [2, 3, 4, 5] have lately reached a frac-
tional accuracy of 0.03% with respect to the total QED con-
tribution. This corresponds to a 10% sensitivity of the ex-
perimental results to the two-loop QED contribution. These
measurements provide an excellent possibility for identiﬁca-
tion of the two-loop Lamb shift and for testing the bound-state
QED up to second order in α in the strong-ﬁeld regime.

The theoretical description of Li-like ions is complicated
by the presence of the electron-electron interaction. For heavy
ions, this interaction can be successfully accounted for within
the perturbative expansion in a small parameter 1/Z (Z is the
nuclear charge number). By calculating a few terms of this ex-
pansion, one can rigorously describe the electron correlation
and the screening of one-loop QED corrections with the ac-
curacy sufﬁcient for identiﬁcation of the two-loop Lamb shift.
Such a project has recently been accomplished in [6, 7]. Based
on these calculations, an “experimental” value of −0.23 eV
was inferred in [5] for the 2s two-loop Lamb shift in Li-like
uranium. A similar determination of the two-loop Lamb shift
was earlier presented in [7] (based on the measurement [3])
for the 2p3/2-2s transition energy in bismuth.

The subject of our present interest is the set of two-loop
one-electron QED corrections (also referred to as the two-loop
Lamb shift), graphically represented in Fig. 1. These cor-
rections have lately been extensively investigated within the
perturbative expansion in the nuclear-strength parameter Zα
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Such studies, however, do not provide re-
liable information about the magnitude of the two-loop Lamb
shift in heavy ions like uranium, where the parameter Zα ap-
proaches unity. Our present investigation is addressed primar-

ily to high-Z ions and will be performed non-perturbatively,
i.e., without an expansion in Zα. The only exception will be
made for the diagrams in Fig. 1(h)-(k), for which we will ex-
pand the fermion loops in terms of the binding potential. We
will keep the leading term of the expansion and refer to this
as the free-loop approximation. In the one-loop case, such ap-
proximation corresponds to the Uehling potential and yields
the dominant contribution even for high-Z ions like uranium.
Necessity for a non-perturbative calculation of the two-
loop Lamb shift became clear already in the beginning of
the 1990s, after the famous measurement [2] of the 2p1/2-2s
transition energy in U89+ with an accuracy of 0.1 eV. Quite
soon, calculations of all diagrams in Fig. 1(d)-(k) were accom-
plished [13] [although the graphs (i) and (k) were calculated
in the free-loop approximation only]. Three remaining dia-
grams (a)-(c), referred to as the two-loop self-energy correc-
tion, turned out to be much more difﬁcult to evaluate. The cal-
culation for the 1s state extended over a decade [14, 15, 16],
with the ﬁrst complete evaluation presented in [17] and later
extended in [18].

In this Letter, we present our calculation of the two-loop
self-energy correction for the 2s, 2p1/2, and 2p3/2 states of
several high-Z ions. We also evaluate the remaining diagrams

in Fig. 1 and obtain results for the total two-loop Lamb shift,
this being previously the largest uncalculated correction for
the 2p -2s transition energies in heavy Li-like ions. Our cal-
culation signiﬁcantly reﬁnes theoretical predictions for these
transition energies and provides a test of bound-state QED
theory in the strong-ﬁeld regime up to second order in α.

Another important aspect of our calculations is associated
with their implications for the hydrogen Lamb shift. In the
previous evaluation of the 1s two-loop self-energy correction
[18], we demonstrated that an extrapolation of our results to
Z = 1 yields a value that disagrees with the analytical result
to order α2(Zα)6 [11]. In view of this disagreement, it will be
of interest to compare our non-perturbative values with the an-
alytical result to order α2(Zα)6 for the normalized difference
of the 2s and 1s energy shifts, ∆s = 8 δE2s − δE1s. Such
a comparison can provide us with new information about the
discrepancy for the 1s state, since, within the perturbative ap-
proach, the difference ∆s is understood much better than the
energy shift of a single ns state [19].

The calculational scheme for the evaluation of the two-loop
self-energy correction was developed for the ground state in
our previous studies [17, 18]. With this work, we extend
it to the excited states. The general procedure for isolation
and cancelation of divergences is similar to that for the 1s
state, but the actual calculational scheme requires substantial
modiﬁcations due to a more complicated pole and angular-
momentum structure of expressions involved. Details of our
calculation will be published elsewhere; in this Letter we con-
centrate on presentation and analysis of the results obtained.

The two-loop self-energy correction to the energy is conve-

niently represented in terms of the function F deﬁned by

where n is the principal quantum number. The numerical re-
sults obtained for the n = 1 and 2 states are listed in Ta-
ble I. The calculation was performed for the point model of
the nuclear-charge distribution.

As an intermediate step in our calculation, we had to con-
sider the irreducible part of the diagram in Fig. 1(a), also de-
noted as the loop-after-loop correction, previously calculated
in [14]. We report a good agreement with the previous re-
sults for the 1s state but ﬁnd a discrepancy for 2s and 2p1/2
states. For Z = 92, we obtain −0.090 eV and −0.030 eV
for the 2s and the 2p1/2 state, respectively, which should be
compared with the values of −0.069 eV and 0.014 eV from
[14], respectively. The apparent reason for this disagreement

is a sign error in the contribution due to the imaginary part of
the self-energy operator.

The consistency of our numerical values can be tested by
comparing them with analytical results obtained within the
perturbative approach. The Zα expansion of the function F
reads

where L = ln[(Zα)−2] and Gh.o.
is the remainder,
Gh.o.(Zα) = B60 + Zα (· · · ) . The coefﬁcients B40-B61 are
presently known for all states of our interest [8, 9, 12]. The co-
efﬁcient B60 was calculated for the speciﬁc differences of en-
− δE2p1/2
ergy shifts ∆s = 8 δE2s − δE1s and ∆p = δE2p3/2
[10, 12]. A calculation of the dominant part of B60(1s) and
B60(2s) was reported in [11], together with an estimate of
unevaluated contributions to this order.

We would like now to isolate the contribution of the higher-
order remainder Gh.o. from our numerical results. Obviously,
such isolation leads to a signiﬁcant loss of precision, which
grows fast when Z decreases. Moreover, the data presented in
Table I for the function F are already a result of a signiﬁcant
(and Z-dependent) cancelation, since individual contributions
to the energy do not exhibit the physical Z 4 dependence but
scale typically as Z or Z 2. This indicates that an analysis of
the Z behavior of the higher-order remainder Gh.o. provides a
stringent test of the consistency of the numerical results.

In Fig. 2, we present our results for the higher-order re-
mainder Gh.o.(Z) for the differences ∆s and ∆p, together
with their limiting values Gh.o.(0) = B60, which are 14.1(4)
for ∆s and −0.3611 for ∆p [10, 12]. The comparison pre-
sented in the ﬁgure indicates that our non-perturbative results
are in good qualitative agreement with the perturbative expan-
sion coefﬁcients known for the differences ∆s and ∆p. A
quantitative comparison is presently impossible due to a lack
of numerical data in the low-Z region. To perform a non-
perturbative calculation for excited states of low-Z ions is a

difﬁcult problem, whose solution apparently requires devel-
opment of new calculational technique. For the 1s state, how-
ever, such a calculation is less problematic and we were able to
carry out a direct evaluation for Z as low as 10 in our previous
investigation [18]. Extrapolating our 1s results to Z = 1 in
that work, we found a disagreement with the analytical value
for the coefﬁcient B60(1s) [11]. Our present calculation for
the difference ∆s and the agreement observed with the ana-
lytical expansion coefﬁcients in this case can be considered as
an evidence in favor of reliability of our previous results for
the 1s state.

In Table II, we present the results of our calculations of all
two-loop corrections depicted in Fig. 1 for the 2p3/2-2s tran-
sition in Bi80+ and the 2p1/2-2s transition in U89+, for which
most accurate experimental data are available. The contribu-
tion of the SESE subset is taken from Table I. The diagrams
in Fig. 1(d)-(g) were calculated rigorously to all orders in Zα,
whereas the diagrams in Fig. 1(h)-(k) were evaluated within
the free-loop approximation, i.e., keeping the ﬁrst nonvan-
ishing contribution in the expansion of the fermion loops in
terms of the binding potential. The error bars speciﬁed for
these corrections are estimations of uncertainty due to the ap-
proximation employed. They were obtained by multiplying
the contribution of Fig. 1(h,i) by a factor of (Zα)2 and that
of Fig. 1(k), by a factor of 3 (Zα). The factor of 3 (Zα)
in the latter estimation arises as a ratio of the leading-order
contribution beyond the free-loop approximation for the di-
agram (k), −0.386 (α/π)2(Zα)5 [20], and the leading-order
contribution within this approximation, 0.142 (α/π)2(Zα)4
[21]. The ﬁnite nuclear size effect was taken into account
in our evaluation of the diagrams in Fig. 1(d)-(i), whereas the
other diagrams were calculated for the point nuclear model. In
the case of uranium, our results for the diagrams with closed
fermion loops are in good agreement with those reported pre-
viously [22].

We now turn to the experimental consequences of our cal-
culations. In Table III, we collect all available theoretical con-
tributions to the the 2p3/2-2s transition energy in Bi80+ and
to the 2p1/2-2s transition energy in U89+. The entry labeled
“Dirac value” represents the transition energies as obtained
from the Dirac equation with the Fermi-like nuclear potential
and the nuclear-charge root-mean-square (rms) radius ﬁxed as
<r2>1/2= 5.851(7) Fm for uranium and 5.521(3) Fm for bis-
muth [23]. The dependence of the Dirac value on the nuclear
model was conservatively estimated by comparing the results
obtained within the Fermi and the homogeneously-charged-

sphere models [24]. We have checked that a wide class of
more general models for the nuclear-charge distribution yields
results well within the error bars obtained in this way.

The next 3 lines contain the corrections due to the one-,
two-, and three-photon exchange, respectively. QED values
for the two-photon exchange correction were taken from our
previous evaluations [6, 25]. The results for the three-photon
exchange correction were obtained in this work within many-
body perturbation theory (MBPT), with retaining the Breit in-
teraction to the ﬁrst order only. For uranium, we report good
agreement with the previous evaluations of this effect [26].
The error ascribed to the three-photon exchange correction is
due to incompleteness of the MBPT treatment. It was esti-
mated by calculating the third-order MBPT contribution with
two and more Breit interactions for each state involved in the
transition, adding these contributions quadratically, and mul-
tiplying the result by a conservative factor of 2.

The entry labeled “One-loop QED” represents the sum of
the ﬁrst-order self-energy and vacuum-polarization correc-
tions calculated on hydrogenic wave functions [22]. The next
line (“Screened QED”) contains the results for the screened
self-energy and vacuum-polarization corrections [27]. The
uncertainty ascribed to this entry is the estimation of higher-
order screening effects; it was obtained by multiplying the
correction by the ratio of the entries “Screened QED” and
“One-loop QED”. The entry “Two-loop QED” contains the
results for the two-loop Lamb shift obtained in the present
investigation. The next two lines contain the values for the
relativistic recoil correction [28] and the nuclear polarization
correction [29].

Table III shows that now, after our calculation of the two-
loop Lamb shift, the total theoretical uncertainty is signiﬁ-
cantly inﬂuenced by the error of the ﬁnite-nuclear-size effect.
It should be noted that a certain concern exists in the commu-
nity about the accuracy of the theoretical description of this
correction. In particular, it was pointed out [30] that little is
known about systematical effects in experimental determina-
tion of nuclear rms radii. In the absence of detailed investiga-
tions of such effects, we consider the errors of rms radii ob-
tained in [23] by averaging all experimental results available
(including both muonic-ions and electron-scattering data) to

4

be presently the most reliable estimates and employ these val-
ues in our calculations.

The comparison presented in Table III demonstrates that
our total results agree well within the error bars speciﬁed with
the experimental data for bismuth and uranium. The theoreti-
cal accuracy is signiﬁcantly better in the former case, which is
the consequence of the fact that the ﬁnite nuclear size effect is
smaller and the nuclear radius is known better. Our result for
the 2p3/2-2s transition in bismuth can also be compared with
the value of 2787.96 eV obtained by Sapirstein and Cheng [7].
The difference of 0.16 eV between the results is mainly due to
the two-loop Lamb shift contribution (0.12 eV) which is not
accounted for in [7].

We conclude that inclusion of the two-loop Lamb shift is
necessary for adequate interpretation of the experimental re-

sult in the case of bismuth, whereas for uranium the two-loop
Lamb shift is signiﬁcantly screened by the uncertainty due to
the nuclear charge distribution. Comparison of the theoretical
and experimental results for bismuth yields the ﬁrst identiﬁca-
tion of the two-loop QED effects in the region of strong bind-
ing ﬁeld, which is the ﬁrst step toward the test of the strong-
ﬁeld regime of bound-state QED at the two-loop level.

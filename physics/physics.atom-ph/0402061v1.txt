Abstract

We review some recent results on recursion relations which help evaluating arbitrary non-diagonal, radial hydrogenic
(β a Dirac matrix) derived in the context of Dirac relativistic quantum mechanics.

matrix elements of rλ
Similar recursion relations were derived some years ago by Blanchard in the non relativistic limit. Our approach is

and of βrλ

based on a generalization of the second hypervirial method previously employed in the non-relativistic Schr¨odinger

case. An extension of the relations to the case of two potentials in the so-called unshifted case, but using an arbitrary

radial function instead of a power one, is also given. Several important results are obtained as special cases of our

recurrence relations, such as a generalization to the relativistic case of the Pasternack-Sternheimer rule. Our results

are useful in any atomic or molecular calculation which take into account relativistic corrections.

1 Introduction

In atomic or molecular physics it is customary the use of sum rules to handle the matrix
elements that appear in many computations[1] - [6]. One of the conspicuous examples is the
Blanchard relation [8] which is a useful recurrence formula for non diagonal, non-relativistic

hydrogenic radial energy eigenstates, and λ is an arbitrary, even non-integer- power of r.1
According to this relation, once we know any three successive matrix elements of powers
of the radial coordinate, r, any other of these elements can be deduced in terms of the
three previous ones. The Blanchard recurrence relation was derived more thirty years ago
using a calculation-intensive method. In the intervening years a simpliﬁed method has been
proposed for deriving the Blanchard rule and, also, new potentially useful relations [6] - [12].
Diﬀerent approaches have been studied for obtaining sum rules between hydrogenic matrix
elements of these sort. Some of them are based on the non relativistic hypervirial theorem
[5], [9], [10], [11].

Most of the sum rules yet discovered are of a non relativistic nature despite the physical
and chemical interest for obtainig relativistic results [9], [10], [25], [26]. Nevertheless, there
has been some eﬀort in constructing new sum rules in the relativistic and quasi-relativistic
approach [12]- [14], [24], [25]. In this review we want to present some of the results obtained
by us in the relativistic case, using an approach inspired on the non relativistic hypervirial
method proposed by some of us some years ago [6], [7].

−

In atomic and molecular physics the non-relativistic approach usually means non rela-
tivistic matrix elements of powers of a radial coordinate between states of the system at hand
[8] - [29]. But in the relativistic approach we must to take into account, in the general case,
the presence of the Dirac’s β matrix in an explicit way in our calculations. This point seems
natural since the β matrix has an eigenvalue +1 for the positive energy eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian and
1 for the negative ones, giving some diferences in the treatment of both
matrix elements. This point gives in general, two series of sum rules, one for matrix elements
without the β matrix and other one for matrix elements with the β explicitly appearing. To
this end we employ a relativistic calculation inspired directly on the hypervirial method [6]
to deduce new recurrence relations for the, in general, non-diagonal radial matrix elements
of succesive powers of rλ and of βrλ—where β is a 4
4 Dirac matrix [18]— for relativistic
hydrogenic states in the energy basis. The assumptions we use here are that the nucleus is
point-like and ﬁxed in space, and that a description using the Dirac equation is, of course,
valid. We ﬁrst study the recurrence relations in the general case, in which the matrix ele-
ments are taken between states with diﬀerent principal quantum numbers n1 6
= n2,, diﬀerent
= mj2, and diﬀerent parity. For

As we mentioned above, we ﬁnd that in general the recurrence relations depend on
matrix elements of both powers of r and of βr, in practical terms this means that we need
two recurrence relations as the relativistic version of the single-equation Blanchard relation.
Given its special interest, we in particular study the case where the total angular momentum
and parity become equal, j1 = j2 and ǫ1 = ǫ2, in the two states—not mattering the relative

values of the principal quantum number n. We also address the completely diagonal case
where n1 = n2, j1 = j2, and ǫ1 = ǫ2. Both of the particular cases mentioned above require
special treatment for avoiding possible divisions by zero in the general expressions; such
results are immediately used to obtain a relativistic version of the Pasternack-Sternheimer
relation [30] and to obtain an expression for the relativistic virial theorem [12], [31].

The results reported in this paper are important because the link between quantum cal-
culations and experimental results is made at the level of matrix elements of the appropriate
operators. In atomic and molecular physics this usually means matrix elements of powers
of a radial coordinate between states of the system at hand [20] - [23], [25] - [28], [32]. But
matrix elements of more general radial functions are also very useful [33] - [36]. Any con-
tribution making less cumbersome the evaluation of a series of these elements is potentially
very useful. In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics the importance of hypervirial results and
other related techniques follows from this fact, since the task of calculating matrix elements
can be indeed simpliﬁed [9], [6]. These techniques are also important for atomic physics
in the relativistic realm [12]- [15]. This can be signiﬁcative at present given the precision
attained in atomic physics experiments using synchroton radiation which is typically less
than the expected values of relativistic corrections in some processes [37] - [41].

In section 2 of this paper, we review the non-relativistic second hypervirial scheme and
we use it to derive the Blanchard relation. In section 3, we deduce a radial Hamiltonian,
completely equivalent to the Dirac equation for central potentials and we employ our result
to implement a corresponding hypervirial result in relativistic quantum mechanics, and we
proceed to use it to deduce by a long, but direct calculation, the relativistic recurrence
formulae. In section 4 we study in particular the diagonal case (j2 = j1, ǫ2 = ǫ1), which
needs a special treatment to avoid division by zero, to derive the relativistic Pasternack-
Sternheimer rule and use it (when n1 = n2) to obtain a version of the relativistic virial
theorem. In section 5 we use Dirac equation to obtain analytic expressions for the bound-
bound, diagonal and non-diagonal matrix elements for arbitrary powers of r. As it becomes
evident, such results are rather cumbersome for relatively large values of the power; for small
values, on the other hand, they are better regarded as starting values for the recurrence
relations derived in section 3 and 4 of this article. In section 6 we explore the extension of
our method to the calculation of generalized recurrence relations for the case of two diﬀerent
potentials. We call the results generalized recurrence relations as they relate matrix elements
of a radial function with those of its derivatives. Also because in the case the function is
chosen as a power of the radial coordinate and the potential is of the Coulomb type we
obtain the sum rules of the preceding sections.

2 The non-relativistic hypervirial method

In this section we develop an alternative approach based on a generalization of the virial
method to obtain the original Blanchard relation. We remind that both Blanchard relation
and its predecesor the Kramers selection rule, were originally obtained employing directly
the Schr¨odinger equation together with appropriate boundary conditions in a rather long
way [8], [1]. The method proposed originally by us is a much simpler one [6]. It is based on a
generalized hypervirial result and certain Hamiltonian identities that has been developed to

3

simplify the computations. This technique seemed also to us an appropriate starting point
for deriving relativistic recurrence formulae, and it is with that point of view that we review
in this section the hypervirial method as it is applied in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.
We employ atomic units ¯h = m = e = 1.

The idea is to start with the radial Schr¨odinger equation for a central potential V (r)

written in the form

nk lki
= ψnklk (r) and Enk lk are respectively, an energy eigenfunction and its energy

epressions. Hk, the non-relativistic radial Hamiltonian, is given by

2.1 A nonrelativistic hypervirial relation

let us say f (r) = rλ+2; using this expression for f (r) and restricting ourselves to the Coulomb
potential, V (r) =

3 The relativistic case

The method sketched in the previous section can be extended to the relativistic Dirac case.
To that end, we need to start with the equivalent of the non-relativistic radial Hamiltonian
of the Schr¨odinger equation for a central potential V (r) (Eq. 3) in the relativistic case. To
obtain such expression we begin with the Dirac Hamiltonian HD for a central potential

The relativistic recurrence relation we are after, can be deduced using a similar reasoning as
the used in section 2 for the non-relativistic case, that is we need a hypervirial result. Let

3.3 The relativistic recurrence relations

To proceed from (37), we now consider, as in the non-relativistic case, only radial functions
of the form f (r) = rλ and we insert the explicit expression for the Coulomb potential:
V (r) =
Z/r. Let us mention though that our results can be generalized to other power
of potentials, such as the Lennard-Jones potential [42]. Substituting f (r) = rλ in (32), it
follows that

It seems to be natural that we obtained six matrix coeﬃcients instead of only three as
in the non-relativistic case. This is to be so, because in the Dirac case we have to deal at
the same time with the big and the small components in the state function of the system,
doubling the ‘degrees of freedom’ we need to know to determine completely a state in the
relativistic realm.

Unfortunately it is not easy to avoid the β-dependency in Eq. (46), and thus, taken
1 > in terms of the
on its own, Eq. (45) does not allow the computation of < 2
< 2
1 >, a = 1, 2, 3. The situation is not hopeless though, because it is still possible
to obtain another recurrence relation for non-diagonal matrix elements of βrλ simply by
eliminating the term

icαrrλ−1 between Eqs. (43) and (45). In such a way we get

We consider Eqs. (46) - (58) as the equivalent of the Blanchard relation for the relativistic
case. The reason appears to be evident in the next section, but let us mention that these
equations produce the relativistic virial theorem, as happens to be also the case in the
non-relativistic Blanchard sum rule (see subsection 2.2).

To end this subsection, we should say that the relativistic recurrence relations can be,
juggling with all the relations used (see [14, 15] for details), put in the uncoupled (and
possibly the simplest) form

results are also obtained when this quantity vanishes. In order to study the diagonal case
we put ǫ1 = ǫ2 and j1 = j2; this in turn imply ∆−
21 = 0. We remark that in all cases

What we have obtained in this last expression is the relativistic generalization of the
Pasternak-Sternheimer rule of non relativistic quantum mechanics [30]. This rule says that
the expectation value between hydrogenic states of the 1/r2 potential, vanishes when the
orbital angular momenta of the states 1 and 2 coincide, that is when l1 = l2. We want to
remark in this point that in the relativistic case, the expectation value of the 1/r potential
(which could be regarded as the square root of 1/r2) times β, does not necessarily vanish
even when the total angular momenta of the two states coincide: j1 = j2. This point
agrees with the fact that the non-relativistic Pasternack-Sternheimer rule is applicable to
eigenfunctions of potentials whose energy eigenvalues depend only on the principal quantum
number—which is not the case for the hydrogen atom in Dirac quantum mechanics [12].
Furthermore, two special cases are immediately deduced from this last expression:

1) The ﬁrst case, when n1 6

4 Analytic results for rλ and βrλ

The recurrence relations found above involve expressions that can be burdensome to han-
dle, excepting perhaps in the diagonal case. Given such situation, before we generalize the
relations above to the case of twopotentials, we calculate explicit formulas to evaluate the di-
agonal and the non-diagonal matrix elements of interest in the particular case of the Coulomb
potential V (r) =
Z/r. The results obtained are based on properties of the hypergeometric
function and can be deduced directly from the two diﬀerential equations that follow directly
from the Hamiltonian (23). In this section we mostly use ideas from [43]. First of all we must
E2
say that we are interested in the bound states of the problem, so the quantity k
is positive. We can write the diﬀerential equations for the radial part of any central problem
in terms of the dimensionless variable ρ

kr. We also deﬁne the following quantities [43]:

5 Generalized recurrence relations for two potentials

In this section we exhibit that the hypervirial techniques suﬃce to obtain relations between
relativistic matrix elements of an arbitrary radial function between eigenstates corresponding

18

to two diﬀerent potentials. We obtain four recursion relations between the matrix elements of
arbitrary radial functions, f (r) and βf (r), with the matrix elements of their ﬁrst and second
derivatives, taken between eigenstates of diﬀerent potential functions, V1(r) and V2(r) —both
behaving as the fourth component of a 4-vector. We call these relations between matrix
elements generalized recurrence relations because they led to relations relating succesive
powers of the radial coordinate when the arbitrary function f (r) is chosen to be rλ where λ
is a constant number. The recursions between matrix elements we deal with in this section
are calculated under the further assumption that the two potentials, V1(r) and V2(r), have
a common minimum, that is, that they are referred to the same origin. The relations lead
to explicit recursions when speciﬁc forms of the radial functions are used and particular
potentials are substituted. The recursions can be useful for studying radiative transitions in
Rydberg atoms, in analysing atomic photorecombination and photoionization processes, for
example, any transition to an autoionizing state studied in the central ﬁeld approximation
where the electron motion is solution of the Dirac equation with an eﬀective central potential
x electron ion core; or in any other atomic processes involving highly
created by a k or a k
excited electrons which need to be studied using multichannel spectroscopy or quantum
deﬀect theory [23, 47, 48, 49]. It can be also useful for calculating relativistic corrections
to ionic oscillator strengths, or in analysing impact ionization or vibrational transitions in
molecules — albeit in the last two cases in a rather crude manner [50, 23, 51, 52, 53].

−

Let us mention that analogous relations for matrix elements between eigenstates of two
potentials were obtained some years ago in nonrelativistic atomic physics also with the help
of hypervirial results [9, 55].

Let us consider two radial Dirac Hamiltonians with two possibly diﬀerent radial potentials
(each behaving as the temporal component of a fourvector) V1(r) and V2(r). We further
assume that these potentials have the same equilibrium position which, furthermore, is
coincident with the origin of coordinates. That is, the recurrence relations correspond to the
so-called unshifted case [9]. The main diﬃculty for not dealing with the general (so called,
shifted) case is the angular couplings introduced by the relative displacement of one of the
potentials respect the other in the otherwise purely radial interactions.

These two Dirac Hamiltonians can be written as

and

H1 = cαr[pr −

iβǫ1(j1 + 1/2)/r] + M1βc2 + V1(r),

H2 = cαr[pr −

iβǫ2(j2 + 1/2)/r] + M2βc2 + V2(r),

= M2 as it is convenient for our calculations. The eigenstates
where we are assuming M1 6
of these radial Hamiltonians correspond to a deﬁnite value of the total angular momentum
J = L+S and of the quantum number ǫ. The Dirac equations are Hkψk(r) = Ekψk(r) where
the energy eigenvalues Enkjksk ≡
ψk(r)
are assumed known.

Equation (119) leads to recursions between relativistic matrix elements of radial functions
between hydrogenic states ([14, 13, 15]), and generalizes a nonrelativistic expression useful
for similar purposes [6]. On the other hand, it is an exact relation for the calculation of
any matrix elements of f (r) between eigenstates of two potentials in relativistic quantum
mechanics.

Taking the potentials as equal, i. e. V1(r) = V2(r), we recover a relation which has
been useful for obtaining recurrence relations between atomic matrix elements in relativistic
quantum mechanics [14, 15]. Albeit exact, equation (119) is not entirely convenient due to
the presence of the operator αrβ. To get rid of this term, we found it convenient to work
directly in terms of operators and not in terms of the matrix elements themselves. The
matrix elements will be evaluated at the end of the operator calculations.

quantum mechanics.

5.2 More generalized recurrence relations for the case of two po-

tentials

Given that the radial eigenstates have two components in relativistic quantum mechanics, it
should be clear that we need more relations. We can obtain at least three more, following a

Equation (134) is the fourth recurrence relation for the calculation of relativistic f (r) matrix
elements between states of diﬀerent potentials in terms of their energy eigenvalues. Notice
that, at diﬀerence of the previous relations [equations (128), (130) and (132)], equation (134)
relates among themselves matrix elements of βf and its derivatives times a certain function
of r.

In summary, in this section we have obtained generalized recurrence relations for the
calculation of matrix elements of a radial function between states of two diﬀerent radial
potentials sharing a common origin. The obtained sum rules are given in the most general
case of an arbitrary function taken between any non-necessarily diagonal radial eigenstates

23

of the two radial potentials. Such relations have, as particular cases, sum rules between one-
potential integrals or, in other particular cases, between overlap and one centre integrals in
Dirac relativistic quantum mechanics. We expect the obtained formulas, together with the
previous relations we have obtained [13, 14, 15], to be useful in atomic or molecular physics
calculations as they may simplify calculation of matrix elements in the range of applicability
of Dirac’s relativistic quantum mechanics [54, 19]. For most uses of the relations we ﬁrst
have to set M1 = M2, i. e. M − = 0 and M + = 2 —assuming the particles are electrons—
since the use of unequal masses is basically a recourse of our calculational method.

From a more practical angle, there is little that can be done for the analytical evaluation
of these integrals beyond the Coulomb and the few similarly exactly solvable potentials.
However, there are relativistic theoretical techniques [56] and numerical methods that, after
being adapted to relativistic conditions, can provide the crucial “seed” results needed for
the systematic use of the recurrence relations obtained here [57]. Our results can be also
useful in the so-called perturbation theory of relativistic corrections, in relativistic quantum
deﬀect calculations, and for the relativistic extension of the calculations of exchange integrals
using Slater orbitals or Coulomb-Dirac wave functions [23, 54, 34, 58, 59]. On the other
hand, our results may be also of some interest in nuclear studies since the 3D Woods-Saxon
potential, used in the Dirac equation for describing the interaction of a nucleon with a heavy
nucleus, has been recently explicitly solved and its eigenfuctions can be expressed in terms
of hypergeometric functions [60].

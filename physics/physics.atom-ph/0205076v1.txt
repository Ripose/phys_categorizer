Abstract. The deexcitation of exotic hydrogen atoms in highly excited states in collisions with hydrogen
molecules has been studied using the classical-trajectory Monte Carlo method. The Coulomb transitions
with large change of principal quantum number n have been found to be the dominant collisional deex-
citation mechanism at high n. The molecular structure of the hydrogen target is shown to be essential
for the dominance of transitions with large ∆n. The external Auger eﬀect has been studied in the eikonal
approximation. The resulting partial wave cross-sections are consistent with unitarity and provide a more
reliable input for cascade calculations than the previously used Born approximation.

1 Introduction

∼

p

Exotic hydrogen atoms x−p (x− = µ−, π−, K −, ¯p) are
formed in highly excited states with the principal quan-
µxp/me where µxp is the reduced
tum number n
mass of the exotic atom [1, 2]. For a long time the ini-
tial stage of the atomic cascade remained poorly under-
stood despite a substantial progress in theoretical and ex-
perimental studies (see [3–5] and references therein). In
particular, the dominant collisional deexcitation mecha-
nism was unclear for 40 years since the so-called chemical
deexcitation was introduced in [1] as a phenomenological
solution to the problem of the cascade time at high n (the
external Auger eﬀect alone would give much longer cas-
cade times). A shortage of experimental data related to
the initial stage of the atomic cascade hindered theoret-
ical studies of this problem. The experimental situation,
however, changed recently as more data on the atomic
cascades in exotic hydrogen atoms at low density became
available. The cascade time of antiprotonic hydrogen mea-
sured by the OBELIX collaboration [6] in the density
range 3
150 mbar was found to be signiﬁcantly shorter
than the prediction of the conventional cascade model [7].
The new experimental results on the atomic cascade in
muonic hydrogen from the PSI experiment [8] provided
detailed information not only on the cascade time, but
also on the energy distribution at the end of the cascade,
which at low density is actually preserved from the initial
stage after the fast radiative deexcitation takes over the
collisional processes.

−

The goal of this paper is to investigate the collisional
deexcitation mechanisms for highly excited exotic atoms.

In particular, we are interested in the role of the Coulomb
acceleration in highly excited states and in the competi-
tion between the acceleration and slowing down in quasi-
elastic collisions. Both molecular and atomic hydrogen tar-
gets were used in our calculations in order to investigate
the role of molecular eﬀects.

The paper is organized as follows. The classical-trajectory

Monte Carlo method is described in Section 2. The results
of calculations of Coulomb, Stark, and transport cross-
sections for the µ−p and ¯pp atoms are presented in Sec-
tion 3. The Auger deexcitation is discussed in Section 4.
The conclusions are summarized in Section 5.

Unless otherwise stated, atomic units (¯h = e = me =
1) are used throughout this paper. The unit of cross-
section is a2

2 Classical-trajectory Monte Carlo calculation

2.1 Eﬀective potential

In the beginning of the atomic cascade, where many nlm-
states are involved in the collisions, classical mechanics
is expected to be a good approximation. To study the
scattering of exotic hydrogen atoms from hydrogen atoms
or molecules we use a classical-trajectory Monte Carlo
model. The following degrees of freedom are included in
the model: the constituents of the exotic atom (x− =
µ−, π−, K −, ¯p and the proton) and the hydrogen atoms are
treated as classical particles. The electrons are assumed

as follows. Given the initial principal quantum number ni
and the orbital angular momentum li of the x−p atom,
the initial classical state was generated as a classical Ke-

angular momentum lc:

The orbit was oriented randomly in space, and the or-
bital x−p motion was set at a random time within the
period. The hydrogen atoms in the target molecule were
set at the equilibrium distance R0, and the molecule was
randomly oriented in space. The impact parameter ρ of
the x−p atom was selected with a uniform distribution in
the interval (0, ρmax), as discussed below. The accuracy
of the numerical calculations was controlled by checking
the conservation of total energy and angular momentum.
Instead of requiring convergence for every individual tra-
jectory, we used the global criteria that the cross-sections
for the various processes (see below) were stable within the
statistical errors against further increase in the numerical
accuracy for each collision.

The ﬁnal atomic state was determined when the dis-
tance between x−p and the hydrogen atoms after the colli-
sion was larger than 10a0. The ﬁnal atomic state with the
energy Exp and the angular momentum lc was identiﬁed
as corresponding to the ﬁnal nf lf state according to the
rules similar to (5,6):

The diﬀerential cross-sections are determined in a similar
way by binning the corresponding intervals of variables

2.3 Special ﬁnal states

The formation of x−H ions in reaction (11) is an arti-
fact of our model due to the treatment of the electrons
as ﬁxed charge distributions. The cross-sections for these
processes turn out to be small, and usually the ﬁnal nf is
small, so that the electron screening is not very important.
For the purpose of cascade calculations, one can count the
x−H formation as the x−p events with the corresponding

values of nf , lf , cos θ, and ∆Etarget. Another channel in-
volving x−H ions is related to the formation of metastable
molecular states like

−

p(x

H)nf lf

(15)

where a deeply bound x−H ion forms a loosely bound state
with the proton. These molecular states can be rather
stable and often do not dissociate within a reasonable
amount of computer time. In our calculations we consider
the metastable molecular states as ﬁnal states. We used
the following criteria for the metastability: ﬁrst, the colli-
sion time must exceed

(16)

tmol = 50/vinit
where vinit is the initial velocity of the x−p in the labora-
tory system. With the choice of the time interval (16), the
colliding particles reach their asymptotically free ﬁnal tra-
jectories for most non-resonant collisions. Second, the x−
must form a bound state with one of the hydrogen atoms
and the binding energy must not vary by more than 1%
within the time

τ = 20

2πn3
i
µxp

(17)

which corresponds to 20 classical periods of the initial x−p
atom. Once metastability is reached, the event is counted
as an x−H event.

3 Results

The classical-trajectory Monte Carlo method described in
Section 2 has been used to obtain the collisional cross-
sections needed in calculations of the cascades in µ−p,
π−p, K −p, and ¯pp. The same method can also be used
in a direct simulation of the atomic cascade without us-
ing pre-calculated cross-sections. For µ−p and ¯pp atoms
experimental data at low density are available for direct
comparison with the cascade calculations [10]. We will,
therefore, present detailed results for these two cases. The
initial stages also aﬀect the cascades in π−p and K −p be-
cause they determine the kinetic energy distribution in
the intermediate stage of the cascade where nuclear ab-
sorption becomes important.

state (ni, T ), 1000 classical trajectories have been calcu-
lated as described above. The orbital quantum number li
was distributed according to the statistical weight. For the
purpose of illustration, a larger number of trajectories (up
to 10000) have been calculated for some initial states in
order to reduce statistical errors. Preliminary results have
been shown in [11].

cross-sections for muonic hydrogen scattering from atomic
hydrogen in a semiclassical model. Though the approach
[12] may be unsuitable for treating the low n states, where
more elaborate calculations give much smaller values for
the cross-sections [13], it can be expected to give a fair
description of the high n region. In the case of Stark mix-
ing we use the ﬁxed ﬁeld model [14] for comparison. In
the case of molecular target, we obtained a semiclassical
estimate of the Stark cross-sections by using the spher-
ical symmetric electric ﬁeld corresponding to the charge
distribution of a H2 molecule in the ground state.

for the atomic target is in fair agreement with the semi-
classical result [12] for energies above 1 eV. The energy
dependence of the CMC cross-sections is approximately
given by 1/√T corresponding to constant rates. This is in
contrast to the 1/T behavior found for low energies in [12].
The distribution over ﬁnal states nf is completely dif-
ferent for the molecular and the atomic targets as illus-
trated in Figure 6 showing the l-average cross-sections
σ13→nf for µ−p at 1 eV. The calculations for atomic target
predict that ∆n = 1 transitions dominate the Coulomb
deexcitation in agreement with the semiclassical result
[12]. For the molecular target, the transitions with ∆n > 1
are strongly enhanced as compared to the atomic case.
The shape of the nf distribution depends on the initial
state ni: with decreasing ni it becomes narrower and its
maximum shifts towards smaller values of ∆n. For ni =
13, the transitions ∆n = 2
3 dominate. Figure 7 shows
−
the nf dependence for initial state ni = 9: the transitions
with ∆n = 1 are most likely, but the ∆n > 1 transitions
still make up a substantial fraction of 38% of the Coulomb
cross-section as compared to 19% for atomic target.

The CMC results for the n dependence of the l-average
Stark mixing cross-section are shown in Figure 8. The
Stark cross-sections calculated with molecular target are
less than twice the atomic ones. This is due to two reasons.
First, there is a considerable molecular screening eﬀect
because the electric ﬁelds from the two hydrogen atoms
partly cancel each other. Second, the Coulomb cross-section
makes up a larger fraction of the total cross-section in the

molecular case. The classical Monte Carlo results for the
atomic target are in a good agreement with the semiclas-
sical ﬁxed ﬁeld model. At low n, where the inelasticity due
to the Coulomb deexcitation is small and can be neglected
in the calculation of the Stark cross-sections, there is a
good agreement between the classical Monte Carlo results
for the molecular target and the corresponding semiclas-
sical model.

Figure 9 shows the energy dependence of the Stark
cross-sections for n = 9. The classical-trajectory model
and ﬁxed ﬁeld model are in agreement with each other
for kinetic energies above 10 eV (molecular target) and
2 eV (atomic target). At lower energies where the Coulomb
transitions make up a substantial part of the cross-sections,
the ﬁxed ﬁeld model overestimates the Stark cross-sections.

The Stark mixing and elastic scattering processes, (20)
and (21), lead to a deceleration of the exotic atom. Their
importance in the kinetics of atomic cascade can be esti-
mated with the corresponding transport cross-section

acceleration, and, in the case of molecular target, the ad-
ditional deceleration due to excitation of the H2 molecule.

The pattern of maxima and minima in the semiclassi-
cal diﬀerential cross-sections is a characteristic feature of
quantum mechanical scattering, which, of course, cannot
be reproduced in a classical model.

∼

The atomic cascade in antiprotonic hydrogen starts around
ni
30; thus classical mechanics is even a better ap-
proximation than in the muonic hydrogen case. The n
dependence of the Stark mixing, Coulomb deexcitation,
transport, and the ¯pH formation cross-sections is shown
in Figure 13, and the energy dependence is demonstrated
in Figure 14. As with muonic hydrogen, the ﬁxed ﬁeld
model overestimates the Stark mixing and especially the
transport cross-section because the inelasticity eﬀects due
to Coulomb deexcitation are not included in this frame-
work.

Figure 15 shows the distribution over the ﬁnal states
nf for the Coulomb deexcitation of the antiprotonic hy-
drogen at the laboratory energy T = 1 eV. For high n
initial states, the most probable Coulomb transitions are
the ones with a large change of the principal quantum
number (∆n
1), with the molecular target being es-
sential for this feature. A very important consequence of
this result is that at the beginning of the atomic cascade a
small number of Coulomb transitions is suﬃcient to bring
the ¯pp to the middle stage, where, depending on the target
density, the radiative or Auger deexcitation takes over.

The dependence of the Coulomb cross-sections on the
angular momentum li of the initial state is weak, see Fig-
ure 16 for antiprotonic hydrogen with ni = 25. The Stark

ellipses in the low l states are more easily perturbed by
the electric ﬁeld of the target molecule. A similar eﬀect is

4 External Auger eﬀect in the eikonal
approximation

In our treatment of the Coulomb and Stark mixing colli-
sions in Section 2, the electronic degrees of freedom were
assumed to be frozen. These degrees of freedom, however,
play an important role in the Auger deexcitation process

The Auger transitions are often treated in the Born ap-
proximation [1] that gives (conveniently) energy indepen-
dent rates. However, this approximation violates unitarity
for some important ranges of principal quantum numbers
and kinetic energies. For kinetic energies in the range of
few eV, the eikonal approximation [15] provides a more
suitable framework. In this section, we use the eikonal
approach to calculate Stark mixing and Auger deexcita-
tion simultaneously. As a result, the corresponding partial
wave cross-sections are consistent with unitarity.

The cross-section for the process (28) was calculated
in [15] by assuming that the exotic atom moves along a
straight line trajectory with constant velocity v through
the electric ﬁeld of the hydrogen atom at rest. The cross-
section is given by

The Auger deexcitation rate, as a function of n, peaks
at the n-value where the energy released in a ∆n = 1 tran-
sition is just suﬃcient to ionize the hydrogen atom. The
eﬀect of these high-rate Auger transitions is that the in-
elastic cross-sections for some partial waves are not small
in comparison with the unitarity limit. Therefore the cor-
responding inelasticity should be taken into account in the
calculations of other collisional processes. One can expect
that taking the Auger eﬀect into account will reduce the
other inelastic cross-sections. In order to examine this ef-
fect, we include the Auger deexcitation in the framework
presented in [14] for calculating Stark mixing and elas-
tic scattering. In the same way as the nuclear absorption
processes in hadronic atoms were taken into account via
imaginary energy shifts of the ns-states, the Auger deex-
citation process is included via the imaginary absorption
potential,
iΓnl(R)/2. The calculations can be done in
the close-coupling model, the semiclassical model, and the
ﬁxed ﬁeld model. In the case of the ﬁxed ﬁeld model, the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for the set of the
n2 matrix

We will refer to this framework as the eikonal multichannel
model.

The l-average Auger deexcitation cross-sections calcu-
lated with the method of [15] (Equations (29) and (30))
agree closely with our results in the eikonal multichannel
model. Figure 17 shows the l-average ∆n = 1 Auger deex-
citation rates in muonic hydrogen for n = 3, 5, 7. The rates
have been calculated in the eikonal approximation and the

Born approximation. The rates in the eikonal approxima-
tion are lower in the low energy range, but they approach
the ones of the Born approximation for high energies. The
n dependence of the Auger deexcitation and Stark mixing
rates for muonic hydrogen is presented in Figure 18. The
two approaches are in a fair agreement with each other ex-
cept for the states n = 6, 7 where the Auger rates have the
highest values. For the state n = 7, the Stark mixing rates
are reduced by almost 50% when the inelasticity due to the
Auger eﬀect is included. This resembles the situation with
the eikonal and the Born approximations which disagree
when the Auger deexcitation cross-sections are large, in
which case the eikonal approximation gives smaller cross-
sections than the Born approximation. The explanation
of this eﬀect is given in Figure 19 showing the average
partial wave cross-sections for the collision (µp)n=7 + H.
The Auger deexcitation cross-sections are saturated in the
low angular momentum region and, therefore, the Born

approximation fails. Though the l-average results agree
for the two eikonal approaches, the l dependence of the
cross-sections in the eikonal multichannel model is weaker
because of the eﬀect of Stark mixing as demonstrated in
Figure 20.

The eikonal approximation as described above does not
give the diﬀerential cross-section and distribution over ﬁ-
nal lf for the Auger transitions. The partial wave cross-
sections, Figure 19, show that the main contribution to
the Auger cross-section comes from low partial waves, i.e.
from the strong mixing region. This suggests that the dis-
tribution in lf is nearly statistical and that the diﬀerential
cross-section is less forward-peaked than the elastic and
Stark diﬀerential cross-sections [14].

5 Conclusions

The collisional deexcitation mechanisms of the exotic hy-
drogen atoms in highly excited states have been investi-
gated in detail using the classical-trajectory Monte Carlo
method. The Coulomb transitions have been shown to
be the dominant mechanism of collisional deexcitation of
highly excited exotic atoms. Target molecular structure
has large eﬀects on the Coulomb deexcitation. In par-
ticular, the distribution over the ﬁnal states favors large
change of the principal quantum number n contrary to the
case of atomic target. This feature is very important for
the cascade kinetics as it leads to a fast deexcitation and
a signiﬁcant acceleration at the initial stage of the atomic
cascade [10]. The calculated cross-sections provide a more
reliable theoretical input for further cascade studies by re-
moving the long standing puzzle of the so-called chemical
deexcitation [1], which was used, on purely phenomenolog-
ical grounds, in many cascade calculations without clari-
ﬁcation of underlying dynamics.

The external Auger eﬀect has been studied in an eikonal
multichannel model which allows us to calculate Stark
mixing, elastic scattering, and Auger deexcitation simul-
taneously. Partial wave cross-sections computed in this
framework are consistent with unitarity. For ranges of
principal quantum numbers and kinetic energies where the
unitarity constraint is important, the Auger cross-sections
computed in this model are signiﬁcantly lower than those
of the Born approximation [1].

The ﬁrst results of cascade calculations using the cross-
sections of [14] and the present paper have been presented
in [17,18]. More detailed results of the cascade calculations
will be discussed in a separate publication [10].

Abstract

A uniﬁed semiclassical time propagator is used to calculate the semiclassical
time-correlation function in three cartesian dimensions for a particle moving
in an attractive Coulomb potential.
It is demonstrated that under these
conditions the singularity of the potential does not cause any diﬃculties and
the Coulomb interaction can be treated as any other non-singular potential.
Moreover, by virtue of our three-dimensional calculation, we can explain the
discrepancies between previous semiclassical and quantum results obtained
for the one-dimensional radial Coulomb problem.

Semiclassical propagation in time has been studied intensively in two dimensions [1–4].
There are by far not as many applications to higher dimensional problems, in particular not
in connection with the singular Coulomb potential. Our motivation for this study is three-
fold: Firstly to see, if the advanced semiclassical propagation techniques in time, namely
the Herman-Kluk propagator [5–7], can be implemented for realistic problems of scattering
theory involving long range forces. Secondly to see, if we can avoid to regularize the Coulomb
singularity in the classical equations of motion if we work in three (cartesian) dimensions,
and thirdly, to clarify the reason for the small, but pertinent discrepancies with the quantum
result in two previous, one–dimensional semiclassical calculations of the hydrogen spectrum
from the time domain [8,9]. As it will turn out, the Coulomb problem with the Hamiltonian
(we work in atomic units unless stated otherwise)

H =

|r|

can be propagated in time semiclassically without taking any special care of the singularity
in the potential which poses a lot of diﬃculties for the one-dimensional radial problem if
Z < 0, i.e., if the potential is attractive as in the case of hydrogen (Z = −1) which we
take as an example in the following. The relevant information in the time domain is the
autocorrelation function

where

c(t) = hψ|K|ψi

K(r, r′

, t) = hr|e

−iHt/¯h|r′

i

is the propagator in the coordinate representation. By diagonalizing K in Eq. (2) one can
express the autocorrelation function with the time evolution operator U(t),

c(t) = hψ(0)|U(t)|ψ(0)i ≡ hψ(0)|ψ(t)i.

This form has the obvious interpretation of correlating the time evolving wavefunction ψ(t)
at each time with its value at t = 0. The extraction of the energy spectrum from Eq. (4) is
routinely performed by Fourier transform,

Expanding formally ψ(t) in terms of eigenfunctions

and inserting Eq. (6) into Eq. (5) one sees that

σ(ω) =

c(t) eiωt dt.

which are determined by the overlap with the initial wavepacket ψ(0). For a ﬁnite propaga-
tion time t the peaks will have a ﬁnite width Γ. Based on an idea by Neuhauser and Wall
[10] Mandelshtam and Taylor [11] have devised the so called ﬁlter–diagonalization method
as an alternative to the Fourier transform for extracting the energy spectrum from a ﬁnite
time signal c(t). Assuming a form

c(t) =

aj eiEj t/¯h

Xj

with aj and Ej being complex the ﬁlter–diagonalization allows one to extract En and bn
directly from Eq. (7). We will use this stable and accurate method to obtain the spectral
information from the time signal c(t) which has been calculated semiclassically as follows.
For the initial wavefunction we have taken a normalized Gaussian wavepacket, ψ(0) =
(γ2/π)3/4fγ(r, r0, p0) with

fγ(r, r0, p0) = exp

where the inverse width γ of the wavepacket and its center (p0, r0) in phase space determine
with which weight the hydrogenic eigenfunctions are covered by ψ(0), see Eq. (8).

The semiclassical propagator according to Herman and Kluk [5] is formulated as an

integral over phase space,

where qt = q(t) and pt = p(t) are the phase space values at time t of the trajectory started
at time t = 0 with (q, p) and propagated under the classical Hamiltonian Eq. (1). The
action S =
(p ˙q − H) dt accumulated along the trajectory enters Eq. (11) as well as the
probability density of each trajectory Rγ(pt, qt) which contains all four blocks Mij of the
monodromy matrix,

The actual form of the probability density depends on a width parameter γ which determines
the admixture of the diﬀerent blocks Mij,

Although this semiclassical propagator is not uniquely deﬁned through its dependence from
a suitable chosen parameter γ it has several important advantages over other forms. Firstly,
it is globally uniformized since at a caustic Rγ remains always ﬁnite. Secondly, and this

Maslov indices. Instead one has to make Rγ continuous as the radicant crosses the branch
cut. Inserting Eq. (11) and Eq. (10) into Eq. (2) we obtain a particularly simple form for
the semiclassical correlation function if the width of the initial Gaussian in ψ(0) and of the
propagator itself in Rγ are chosen to be the same,

The integrations over r and r′ have been carried out analytically which is possible due to
our choice of the initial wavepacket as a Gaussian. The remaining integral in Eq. (14) is over
the entire phase space and in practice csc(t) is calculated by Monte Carlo integration where
each randomly chosen phase space point (q, p) represents the initial conditions for a classical
trajectory. It evolves in time under Hamilton’s equations generated by the Hamiltonian of
Eq. (1) and with the values (qt, pt) entering Eq. (14). The number of sampling points
(trajectories to be run) to achieve convergence depends very much on the initial wavepacket
ψ(0). In general it varies between a couple of thousand and a couple of million trajectories.
Our ﬁrst objective is to compare our results with earlier one dimensional calculations
[8,9]. Although we work in three dimensions we can mimic the one dimensional results to
some extent by choosing a similar initial wavepacket.

The result with parameters similar to those from [8] is shown in Fig. (1). One sees
excellent agreement concerning the positions of the peaks with quantum mechanics (crosses)
and small but noticeable deviations of the weights of the states. This observation, as the
entire ﬁgure, is very similar to the ﬁndings of [8] and [9]. However, we would like to emphasize
that our result has been obtained from a ‘routinely’ applied semiclassical propagator without
explicit regularization or Langer corrections or any other means implemented to deal with the
Coulomb singularity. These complication, dealt with in [9], occur only if one uses explicitly
curved linear coordinates where the problem of the order of operators renders the classical–
quantum correspondence diﬃcult. This becomes obvious if the semiclassical propagator is
derived from Feynman’s path integral, see e.g., Kleinert’s book on path integrals [12]. Of
course, the prize one has to pay in order to avoid these complications in, e.g., a radial
coordinate, is to work in a higher dimensional (cartesian) space as it has been done here.

However, even in our approach we should regularize trajectories which hit the Coulomb
singularity directly (impact parameter zero). Fortunately, these ’head on’ trajectories are
of measure zero among all trajectories contained in the initial conditions and with a Monte
Carlo method they are hardly ever encountered. Even if such a trajectory is selected by
chance, one can safely discard its contribution to the propagator.

The direct semiclassical integration is in principle able to reproduce the spectrum even
for low excitation as can be seen in Fig. (2), and, less surprisingly, for medium excitation
(Fig. (3)). However, a systematic trend is apparent from these two spectra: The agreement

of the weights is much better to the left of the largest peak than to the right. To understand
this eﬀect we have plotted in Fig. (3) the average angular momentum fraction

contained in the weights bn in addition. One sees that good agreement goes along with a
large fraction of high angular momentum states in the initial wavepacket and vice versa.

To support this ﬁnding we have prepared a diﬀerent wavepacket with an additional kick
(initial momentum) perpendicularly to the axis connecting the center of the wavepacket
and the Coulomb center. This creates a large fraction of high angular momentum states as
can be seen in Fig. (4). The agreement with the quantum power spectrum is in this case,
covering the same energy window as [8,9], and Fig. (1), much better. Naturally, the one
dimensional radial calculations of [8,9] have only l = 0 states and in Fig. (1) the average
angular momentum ℓ is also low by construction through the initial state.

Hence, we can conclude that the power spectrum of hydrogen, including the weights,
can be reproduced semiclassically. While the semiclassical energies En are generally in
good agreement with the quantum eigenvalues the semiclassical weights bn are only accurate
if the initial wave packet contains a large
in the limit of large quantum numbers, i.e.
fraction of high angular momentum states in each degenerate manifold n. This reﬂects
the larger sensitivity of the weights described by oﬀ–diagonal matrix elements, compared
to the (diagonal) energies. Seen in a wider context, our result implies the consequence
that a one dimensional radial quantum problem is not really one dimensional. Rather, it
is the limit of angular momentum l = 0 in three, or at least two dimensions. Hence, even
for large quantum numbers n in the radial problem the semiclassical limit is not reached
since the angular momentum quantum number is zero. The incomplete semiclassical limit
causes in the case of the hydrogen problem the remaining discrepancies in the purely radial
semiclassical spectrum compared with the quantum spectrum. One may also view the failure
of the one dimensional radial WKB treatment for l = 0 even for large quantum numbers n
as a consequence of this incomplete semiclassical limit.

In summary, constructing the time correlation function semiclassically in three cartesian
dimensions with the help of the Herman-Kluk propagator we have demonstrated that the
singular Coulomb potential can be treated as any other non-singular interaction without
any special precautions. Moreover, by virtue of our three-dimensional treatment, we could
clarify the origin of the discrepancies between the quantum and the semiclassical calculation
restricted to the radial dynamics only. We hope that this result stimulates future applications
of semiclassical propagator techniques to Coulomb problems.

value methods. JMR acknowledges the hospitality of the Insitute for Advanced Study,

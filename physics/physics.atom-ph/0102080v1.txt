Abstract
The rate of ddµ muonic molecule resonant formation in dµ atom collision with a condensed
deuterium target is expressed in terms of a single-particle response function. In particular, ddµ
formation in solid deuterium at low pressures is considered. Numerical calculations of the rate in
the case of fcc polycrystalline deuterium at 3 K have been performed using the isotropic Debye
model of solid.
It is shown that the energy-dependent ddµ formation rates in the solid diﬀer
strongly from those obtained for D2 gaseous targets, even at high dµ kinetic energies. Monte
Carlo neutron spectra from dd fusion in ddµ molecules have been obtained for solid targets with
diﬀerent concentrations of ortho- and para-deuterium. The recent experimental results performed
in low pressure solid targets (statistical mixture of ortho-D2 and para-D2) are explained by the
presence of strong recoilless resonance peaks in the vicinity of 2 meV and very slow deceleration
of dµ atoms below 10 meV. A good agreement between the calculated and experimental spectra
is achieved when a broadening of D2 rovibrational levels in solid deuterium is taken into account.
It has been shown that resonant ddµ formation with simultaneous phonon creation in solid gives
only about 10% contribution to the fusion neutron yield. The neutron time spectra calculated for
pure ortho-D2 and para-D2 targets are very similar. A practically constant value of the mean ddµ
formation rate, observed for diﬀerent experimental conditions, is ascribed to the fact that all the
recent measurements have been performed at temperatures T . 19 K, much lower than the target

INTRODUCTION

Theoretical study of resonant formation of the muonic molecule ddµ in condensed deu-
terium targets is the main subject of this paper. The resonant ddµ formation, ﬁrst observed
by Dzhelepov and co-workers [1], is a key process of muon catalyzed fusion (µCF) in deu-
terium (see e.g. reviews [2, 3]). A muonic deuterium atom dµ is created when a negative
muon µ− is captured into an atomic orbital in a deuterium target. After dµ deexcitation
to the 1S state and slowing down, the ddµ molecule can be formed in dµ atom collision
with one of the D2 target molecules. The resonant formation is possible due to presence
of a loosely bound state of ddµ, characterized by the rotational number J = 1 and vibra-
tional number v = 1, with binding energy
1.97 eV. This energy, according to
|
the Vesman mechanism [4], is completely transferred to excited rovibrational states of the
molecular complex [(ddµ)dee]. The scheme of calculation of ddµ formation rate in gaseous
deuterium has been developed for many years [5, 6, 7, 8], and has lead to a good agreement
with the experiments performed in gaseous targets [9, 10]. On the other hand, this theory,
when directly applied to solid deuterium targets, leads to strong disagreement with the ex-
perimental results [11, 12, 13]. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate the ddµ formation rate
with solid state eﬀects taken into account, which is the main purpose of this paper.

εJv=11

| ≈

Our calculations are based on the theoretical results (transition matrix elements, reso-
nance energies) obtained in the case of ddµ formation in a single D2 molecule. In Sec. II
the main formulas used for this case are brieﬂy reported. A general formula for the energy-
dependent ddµ formation rate in a D2 condensed target is derived in Sec. III, using the Van
Hove formalism of the single-particle response function [14]. This formula is then applied
(Sec. IV) for harmonic solid targets, in particular for a cubic Bravais lattice. A phonon
expansion of the response function is used to study phonon contributions to the resonant
formation. Numerical results for 3 K zero pressure frozen deuterium targets (TRIUMF ex-
perimental conditions [11, 13]), with the fcc polycrystalline structure, are shown in Sec. V.
The formation rates have been calculated assuming the isotropic Debye model of the solid
and the values of Debye temperature and lattice constant observed in neutron scattering
experiments.

The calculated rates of resonant ddµ formation and back decay have been used for Monte
Carlo simulations of dd fusion neutron and proton time spectra. Since the initial distributions
of 1S muonic atom energy contain contributions from hot dµ’s (
1 eV) [15, 16], inﬂuence
of slow deceleration of dµ atoms below 10 meV [17] on these time spectra is investigated
in Sec. VI. The simulations take into account the processes of incoherent and coherent dµ
atom scattering in solid deuterium. In particular, the Bragg scattering, phonon scattering,
and rovibrational transitions in D2 molecules are included. We consider a dependence of
the resonant formation rate and time spectra on broadening of the rovibrational D2 energy
levels, due to the binding of the molecules in the lattice [18].

∼

Since it has been predicted in Refs. [19, 20, 21] that strong ddµ formation takes place only
in solid para-D2, study of this process in pure ortho-D2 and para-D2 targets is another aim
of this work. The neutron spectra calculated for these two solids are discussed in Sec. VI.

where D2 is a free deuterium molecule in the initial rovibrational state (νiKi) and the

The complex [(ddµ)dee] is created in the rovibrational state (νf Kf ) and the molecular ion
ddµ, which plays the role of a heavy nucleus of the complex, has total spin S. The rate

When fusion takes place, the muon is generally released and can again begin the µCF cycle.
However, sometimes the muon is captured into an atomic orbital of helium (sticking), which
stops further reactions.

and the curly brackets stand for the Wigner 6j symbol. In formula (8) the usual Boltzmann
factor describing the population of rotational states in a gas target is omitted because we
calculate the formation rate separately for each initial rotational state. If the muonic atoms
in a gas have a steady kinetic energy distribution f (ε, T ) at target temperature T , Eq. (7)
can be averaged over the atom motion leading to a mean resonant rate λSF

νiKi,νf Kf (T ).

III. RESONANT FORMATION IN A CONDENSED TARGET

Since a muonic deuterium atom can be approximately treated as a small neutron-like
particle, methods used for description of neutron scattering and absorption in condensed
matter are applicable in the case ddµ formation in dense deuterium targets. Below we adapt
the method developed by Lamb [26], and then generalized by Singwi and Sj¨olander [27]
using the Van Hove formalism of the single-particle response function
Si [14], for calculation
of the resonant ddµ formation rates.
A Hamiltonian Htot of a system, consisting of a dµ atom in the 1S state and a heavy

condensed D2 target, can be written down as follows

Htot =

1
2Mdµ ∇

2

Rdµ + Hdµ(r1) + HD2(̺1) + V (r1, ̺1, ̺2) + H ,

(10)

where Mdµ is the dµ mass and Rdµ denotes the position of dµ center of mass in the coor-
dinate frame connected with the target (see Fig. 1). Operator Hdµ is the Hamiltonian of
a free dµ atom, r1 is dµ internal vector; HD2 denotes the internal Hamiltonian of a free D2
molecule. It is assumed that ddµ formation takes place in collision with the l-th D2 target
molecule. The position of its mass center in the target frame is denoted by Rl; ̺1 is a vector
connecting deuterons inside this molecule. Function V stands for the potential of the dµ–D2
interaction [8], leading to ddµ resonant formation. Vector ̺2 connects the dµ and D2 centers
of mass. We neglect contributions to the potential V from the molecules other than the l-th
molecule because we assume here that distances between diﬀerent molecules in the target
are much greater than the D2 size. The kinetic energy ε of the dµ atom and its momentum k
in the target frame are connected by the relation

ε = k2/2Mdµ .

Factor Bif , deﬁned by Eqs. (8), is due to the averaging over the initial projections and

over three deuterium nuclei.

The ﬁrst term in expansion (44) represents a sharp peak describing the δ proﬁle recoilless
formation. The next terms give broad distributions corresponding to subsequent multi-

V. RESONANT FORMATION IN FROZEN DEUTERIUM

The following considerations concern the solid deuterium crystals used in the TRIUMF
experiments [32, 33], though the results presented below can be applied to targets obtained
in similar conditions [12, 34]. At TRIUMF thin solid deuterium layers have been formed by
rapid freezing of gaseous D2 on gold foils at T = 3 K and zero pressure. According to Ref. [35]
such deuterium layers have the face-centered cubic (fcc) polycrystalline structure. Since the
distance between the neighboring molecules is a few times greater than the diameter of
a D2 molecule and the Van der Waals force that binds the solid is weak, one can neglect
perturbations of the resonant formation potential V due to these neighbors.

The deuterium crystals at zero pressure are quantum molecular crystals. The amplitude
of zero-point vibration at 3 K equals 15% of the nearest neighbor distance. A single-particle
potential in this case is not harmonic and the standard lattice dynamics leads to imaginary
phonon frequencies. However, the standard dynamics can be applied after a renormalization
of the interaction potential, taking into account the short-range pair correlations between
movement of the neighbors [35]. In result, the theoretical calculations [36] of the phonon
dispersion relations give a good agreement with the neutron scattering experiments [37] and
the Debye model for solid deuterium can be used as a good approximation of the phonon
energy distribution

with the Debye energy wD = kBΘD and Debye temperature ΘD taken from the neutron

are very good approximations of Eqs. (41), (48) and (49). The Debye-Waller factor and
mean kinetic energy
ET at lowest temperatures are determined by contributions from the
zero-point D2 vibration in the lattice, and therefore these quantities do not tend to zero at
T

0. The zero-point energy is not accessible energy, but its eﬀects are always present.
→
The values of the resonance energies depend on initial and ﬁnal rovibrational quantum
numbers of the system. In solid hydrogens at low pressures these quantum numbers remain
good quantum numbers, but excited energy levels broaden into energy bands (rotons and
vibrons) due to coupling between neighboring molecules [18]. The calculations presented in
the literature concern pure solid H2, HD and D2 targets and only lowest quantum numbers.
The problem of a heavier impurity, such as (ddµ)d complex in D2, has not been considered
yet. However, knowing that the width of the rotational bands can reach about 1 meV [18],
a possible inﬂuence of this eﬀect on the calculated formation rates and fusion neutron time
spectra is discussed in the next section.

At low temperatures all D2 molecules are in the ground vibrational state νi = 0 and ddµ
is formed via the excitation of the complex to the state νf = 7. Unless a catalyst is applied,
rapidly frozen deuterium is a mixture of ortho-D2 (Ki = 0) and para-D2 (Ki = 1). In the
TRIUMF experiments gaseous deuterium was pumped through a hot palladium ﬁlter before
freezing. Therefore the solid target was a statistical mixture (2:1) of the ortho- and para-
states (Ki = stat). Since the para-ortho relaxation without a catalyst is very slow (0.06%/h)

10

in solid deuterium [38], the population of these states is not changed during experiments of
a few days.

The lowest resonance energies εif and ε′

if , for ﬁxed νi, νf and diﬀerent values of F , Ki,
S and Kf are shown in Table I [10]. A few of them have negative values, which means that
to satisfy the resonance condition ε = εif an energy excess in the dµ+D2 system should be
transferred to external degrees of freedom. This is possible in dense targets, where energy
of neighboring molecules can be increased. Such an eﬀect, due to triple collisions in gas
targets, has been ﬁrstly discussed in Ref. [39]. In a solid, the energy excess is lost through
incoherent phonon creation. According to (25), (28), and (51), in the considered 3 K solid
deuterium all resonant energies ε′
1.81 meV. One can see that

all resonances for F = 1

splitting ∆Ehfs = 48.5 meV. All resonance energies ε′

formation from the upper spin state F = 3
2 of dµ. However, only resonances corresponding
to the dipole transitions Ki = 0
Kf = 0, 2 can give a signiﬁcant
Kf = 1 and Ki = 1
contribution to the formation rate at lowest energies. Other transition matrix elements
described in Ref. [40] tend to zero when ε
0 (see Figs. 3 and 4 obtained for Ki = 0 and
Ki = 1 ).

niﬁcant terms of the response function expansion (40) taken into account. Fig. 5 shows the

sible and it is represented by a vertical line. Diﬀerent peaks in this ﬁgure describe processes
connected with diﬀerent numbers of created phonons. In particular, one-phonon processes,
which are proportional to Z(w) with the characteristic Debye cutoﬀ, can be clearly distin-
guished. Since the n-phonon term in (40) is proportional to κ2n, the ddµ formation rate

Since the frequency of lattice vibrations (

nitude greater than the back-decay and fusion rates, energetic phonons created during
the ddµ formation process are dissipated. At 3 K the number of phonons with energies
w & kBT
0.26 meV is strongly suppressed by the Bose factor nB(w). Therefore back
decay with phonon annihilation at T
ΘD is negligible. In particular, the phonon channel
of decay of ddµ, formed from dµ state F = 3
2 due to the subthreshold resonances, is closed
because this would require an annihilation of a phonon with energy of a few meV. In this case
back decay is connected with the spin-ﬂip transition to F ′ = 1
2. Since the corresponding en-
ergy release of a few tens of meV is much greater than the Debye energy (∆Ehfs
wD), the
ddµ decay rate is dominated by contributions from simultaneous phonon creation processes.

containing [(ddµ)dee] is similar to that of a pure deuterium lattice. The problem of lattice
dynamics of a quantum solid deuterium crystal containing a small admixture of a heavier

The eﬀective formation rates in 3 K solid deuterium for F = 3

2 are shown in Fig. 7.
The phonon part of the rates below a few meV is about two orders of magnitude lower
than the average rate of 2.7 µs−1 derived from the experiment [11, 13]. This means that
wD the phonon contribution to the total resonant formation rate is even smaller
at ε
0.44 µs−1 [9], and that the estimation of the

phonon contribution given in Ref. [20] is strongly overestimated. Therefore, the experimental
results can only be explained by resonant ddµ formation at energies ε & 1 meV, where
the rate exceeds signiﬁcantly the value of 1 µs−1. A cusp at 0.3 meV in para-D2 is due
to the formation with simultaneous one-phonon creation, connected with the subthreshold
resonance Ki = 1
Kf = 0. This implies a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the resonant
formation in ortho-D2 and para-D2 below 1 meV. However, this diﬀerence is diﬃcult to
measure because of a broad distribution of dµ energy. Note that a similar subthreshold
phonon eﬀect in the case of resonant dtµ formation in solid deuterium has been discussed
in Ref [41].

In Fig. 8 the eﬀective rates in solid deuterium for F = 1

shows that in a real solid deuterium target the rates are smeared much more than in a gas
target with the same temperature, because of the zero-point vibrations. Therefore even at
relatively high dµ energies of some 0.1 eV one should not neglect the solid eﬀects and use
the formation rates calculated for a 3 K Maxwellian gas.

VI. MONTE CARLO CALCULATIONS

The calculated energy-dependent ddµ formation rates have been applied in our Monte
Carlo simulations of µCF in 3 K solid deuterium targets. The ﬁnal dµ energy distribution
after back decay, including simultaneous phonon creation processes, has been determined
through a numerical integration of Eq. (56). The calculated distribution is shown in Fig. 9

creation contribution to dµ energy. Note that, opposite to ddµ formation rates, this phonon

contribution (for a given rotational transition peak) extends towards lower energies. The
average dµ energy after ddµ back decay equals about 30 meV, for the presented spectrum.
The dd fusion neutron and proton spectra depend on the time evolution of dµ energy.
This energy is determined by diﬀerential cross sections of diﬀerent scattering processes of dµ
atoms in a given solid target, including elastic scattering, rovibrational transitions, spin-ﬂip
reactions and phonon processes. The scattering cross sections in a solid are calculated using
the Van Hove method. Some results of such calculations for dµ atoms in fcc solid deuterium
have been presented and discussed in Ref. [42]. The incoherent processes, such as spin-ﬂip or
rovibrational transitions, are described by the self pair correlation function Gs(r, t) deﬁned
by Eq. (29). The Bragg scattering and coherent phonon scattering are connected with a pair
correlation function G(r, t) [14].

In Fig. 10 is shown the total cross section for dµ(F = 3

2) scattering in the statistical
mixture of 3 K solid ortho-D2 and para-D2. Bragg scattering, with the Bragg cutoﬀ at
εB = 1.1 meV, and incoherent elastic scattering do not change dµ energy because of the very
large mass of the considered solid target. Below 1.7 meV the dµ atom is eﬀectively acceler-
ated, mainly due to the rotational deexcitation of para-D2 molecules [21, 42]. This transition
is enabled by muon exchange between deuterons in dµ+D2 scattering. The curve “0
1”
→
in Fig. 10, describing the rotational deexcitation, includes contributions from simultaneous
10−20 cm2,
incoherent phonon processes. This cross section at ε = 2.5 meV equals 0.22
which is about three times less (taking into account the statistical factor of 1/3 for K = 1
states) than the estimation given in paper [21]. Phonon annihilation is a much weaker dµ
acceleration mechanism than the rotational deexcitation.

×

Since the coherent amplitude for dµ elastic scattering on a single D2 molecule is greater
by two orders of magnitude than the incoherent amplitude, the coherent processes involving
conservation of momentum dominate low energy dµ scattering in solid deuterium.
It is
especially important below a few meV, where the shapes of coherent and incoherent cross
sections diﬀer strongly. The small phonon creation cross section below 1.1 meV, leading to
dµ energy loss, is due to the incoherent amplitude. Coherent phonon creation is impossible
below εB. This limit is obtained in the case of coherent one-phonon creation process, for
the total momentum conservation involving the smallest (non-zero) inverse lattice vector τ ,
which also ﬁxes the position of the ﬁrst peak of the Bragg scattering at εB = 1.1 meV. For
τ = 0 one-phonon creation is possible only if the dµ velocity is not lower than the sound
velocity in the crystal, which is well-known in neutron physics. According to Ref. [38] the
105 cm/s and this corresponds
mean sound velocity in solid deuterium equals about 1.2
to dµ energy of 15 meV. Therefore, neglecting the inverse lattice contribution to the one-
phonon creation cross section in Ref. [21] leads to the severe underestimation of dµ slowing
down at lowest energies and subsequent overestimation of dµ kinetic energy.

×

Above 1.7 meV phonon creation already prevails over all acceleration processes. However,
the eﬀective deceleration rate below wD is strongly suppressed by the dominating Bragg
elastic scattering. At energies above some 10 meV subsequent rotational and then vibrational
excitations of D2 molecules become important and they provide a very fast mechanism of
dµ deceleration at higher energies.

The total cross section for dµ(F = 3

2) scattering in a pure 3 K ortho-D2 target (see
Fig. 11) is quite similar to that shown in Fig. 10. A signiﬁcant diﬀerence is the lack of
rotational deexcitation. Therefore phonon annihilation is the only, and weak, acceleration
mechanism. It dominates the inelastic cross section below 1.4 meV.

Fig. 12 presents the time evolution of average dµ(F = 3

2) atom energy εavg, obtained from

our Monte Carlo calculations. It is assumed that the target is inﬁnite and that dµ atoms
have initially a Maxwellian energy distribution with a mean energy of 1 eV. A statistical
initial population of dµ total spin is used and the theoretical non-resonant part of the total
spin-ﬂip rate λ 3
is multiplied by a single scaling factor of 0.4, in order to keep agreement
2 ,
with the experimental values [10, 43] of the spin-ﬂip rate. The calculations have been
performed for ortho-D2, para-D2 and their statistical mixture (stat). One can see that
dµ mean energy of 10 meV is reached already after 5 ns. Then, below the Debye energy,
deceleration become very slow. The lowest value of εavg is determined by the intersection
point of the cross sections of the acceleration processes and phonon creation process. In the

Since at energies of a few meV the lowest delta peaks are dominant in the resonant
formation, their contributions to the mean eﬀective formation rate are shown in Fig. 13 for
gas and solid deuterium (stat) targets, assuming steady Maxwell distributions of dµ(F = 3
2)
energy, with diﬀerent εavg. The maximum average rate of about 6 µs−1 in the solid is
1.8 meV. The experimental result of 3 µs−1 can be
due to the resonance energy shift of
explained because εavg is greater than 1 meV. However, in order to obtain large fusion
neutron and proton yields through resonant ddµ formation, the width ΓS of the resonance
peaks in solid can not be too narrow. The peak resonant rates of a few 104µs−1 have been
obtained assuming the discrete values of the rovibrational D2 energies in solid deuterium
10−3 meV. These resonant rates are many orders of magnitude greater than the
and ΓS
∼
10 µs−1. In such a case dµ atoms are very quickly (compared to
inelastic scattering rate
dµ(F = 3
2) lifetime) removed from the regions of resonance peaks and the contribution of the
recoilless resonances to the neutron yield is negligible. The Monte Carlo simulations have
shown that the neutron yield from the phonon part of the resonant rates gives only some 10%
of the yield observed in the experiments. In result, the calculated time spectra, obtained
for the small ΓS, are dominated by weak non-resonant ddµ formation, which disagrees with
the experimental data. Therefore, we have investigated inﬂuence of a broadening of the
non-phonon resonant peaks, due to the presence of molecular rovibrational bands in solid,
discussed in Ref. [18]. Since in the literature there is no information concerning the proﬁle
of such bands, we have assumed a rectangular shape of the resonance peaks. The resonance
strengths have been ﬁxed and their widths have been changed in the limits 0.001–1 meV. It
turns out that good Monte Carlo results are obtained for ΓS
0.5 meV, which is consistent
with the rotational bandwidths of about 1 meV reported in Ref. [18]. This gives the resonant
formation rate of 294 µs−1 for the recoilless peak in ortho-D2, and respectively 214 µs−1 in
para-D2. In Fig. 14 one sees the resonant formation rate at lowest energies for ΓS = 0.5 meV
and for the statistical mixture of ortho- and para-states. Also shown is the Monte Carlo
distribution of dµ(F = 3
2) energy, calculated for times t = 10 ns and t = 30 ns. The
Maxwell distribution of initial dµ energy, with εavg = 1 eV, has been assumed. Two minima
in the dµ energy distribution appear quickly at the positions of the resonance peaks since
the respective ddµ formation rates are comparable with the total inelastic scattering rate of

rate which also changes the population of dµ(F = 3
2) atoms in the vicinity of the resonant
peaks. The steady-state kinetics model does not include the process of dµ deceleration.
Therefore, ﬁts using this model could entangle the deceleration rate with the formation and
spin-ﬂip rates. The mean formation rate, calculated directly in the Monte Carlo runs, is
a function of time, and it stays at the level of 1–3 µs−1. The spectrum slope at large times
t & 100 ns, when dµ(F = 3
2 ) atoms practically disappear, are due to the nonresonant ddµ
formation from F = 1

2 and to the muon transfer to nitrogen contamination.
The shape of the time spectra practically does not change when the mean energy εavg of
the initial single Maxwell distribution varies in the limits 0.01–1 eV. On the other hand, the
spectra change strongly if a signiﬁcant part of dµ atoms at t = 0 has energy smaller than
the energy of the lowest resonant peak, which can be observed using a more complicated
(e.g. two-Maxwell distribution). Assuming that ΓS is greater than 0.5 meV we obtain results
which begin to diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the analytical curve calculated with the experimental
parameters. In particular, the ratios of neutron yields from the short and large times begin
to disagree. Fits of the calculated spectra to the experimental data would enable a better
determining of ΓS and a shape of the initial dµ energy. However, this is not the purpose
of this work. A qualitative comparison of Monte Carlo spectra with the experimental data
has already been performed in article [13]. In this case good ﬁts were not obtained since
at that time the resonant ddµ formation rates in solid D2 and dµ scattering rates including
coherent eﬀects in the solid were not yet available.

Our calculations show that strong resonant ddµ formation takes place both in ortho-D2
and para-D2. There are certain diﬀerences between the neutron time spectra from these
targets (see Fig. 16), caused by the diﬀerent positions and strengths of the lowest resonance
peaks. Also dµ slowing down process diﬀers slightly in the two cases. The neutron yield at
larger times is smaller for ortho-D2 since in this case the resonance peak is placed at higher
energy of 2.3 meV. Therefore, dµ atoms are removed faster from the peak compared to the
situation in para-D2, where the resonance is observed at 1.6 meV. A greater mean dµ energy
in para-D2 (cf. Fig. 12) leads also to a stronger overlap of the resonance peak and dµ energy
distribution at t & 20 ns. However, the diﬀerences between the spectra can be clearly seen
only in high-statistics experiments.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

The methods used for description of resonant neutron and γ-ray absorption in condensed
matter have been directly applied for calculation of resonant ddµ formation and back-decay
rates in condensed deuterium targets. These rates are expressed in terms of the Van Hove
single-particle function, which depends on properties of a given target. In particular, we
have derived the analytical formulas for the rate in the case of resonant ddµ formation in
a harmonic solid deuterium. The calculations show great diﬀerences between resonant ddµ

formation in 3 K solid deuterium and in 3 K D2 gas. In solid, the formation at a few meV,
which determines the experimental results, is dominated by presence of the strong recoilless
resonant peaks. On the other hand, the formation with simultaneous phonon creation is
important above the Debye energy. The resonance proﬁles in the solid at higher energies are
similar to that in D2 gas, but with the eﬀective temperature equal to 40 K. This temperature
is determined by the energy of zero-point vibration of D2 molecule in the lattice. Phonon
creation is always important in the case of ddµ back decay because it is connected with
energy release of a few tens meV, which is much greater than the Debye energy.

A condition T /ΘD ≪

1 is fulﬁlled for any solid deuterium target at low pressure. There-
fore, the parameters determining solid state eﬀects (Debye-Waller factor, mean energy of D2
vibration in solid) weakly depend on target temperature T . They are expressed in terms of
the Debye energy wD which does not signiﬁcantly change with the varying solid tempera-
ture T . In result, the resonant ddµ formation rates in solid deuterium for diﬀerent T are very
similar and one may expect that the average formation rates, derived from measurements
performed at diﬀerent temperatures, will also be very close. This is conﬁrmed by the results
of experiments carried out at TRIUMF and at JINR.

The structure of a solid deuterium target depends on its temperature and history. Targets
maintained at T & 4 K have the hcp structure [35]. Though our calculations have been
performed for fcc crystals, the obtained results are also good approximations of the resonant
rates in hcp polycrystals since the Debye temperature and nearest neighbor distance are
similar for these two lattices. In general, the formulas derived in this paper can be used in
a wide range of target temperature and density, with appropriate experimental values of the
Debye temperature and lattice constant taken into account.

The Monte Carlo calculations show that dµ deceleration below the Debye energy is very
slow and that mean energy of dµ(F = 3
2 ) atom is always signiﬁcantly greater than 1 meV. The
energy distribution of dµ’s during their lifetime is very broad (at least a few meV), therefore
a strong overlap of this distribution and lowest resonance peaks takes place, leading to a large
mean ddµ formation rate in solid deuterium. However, explanation of the experiments is
possible only if the broadening of rovibrational molecular levels in solid is taken into account.
We obtained reasonable results assuming that the strengths of the recoilless resonant peaks
are constant and that the rotational bands increase the resonance peak width to 0.5 meV.
Note that, according to Ref. [18], high pressures lead to a greater broadening and even to
a mixing of rotational states. This could complicate a comparison of theory and high-pressure
experiments. The phonon part of the resonant rate give only about 10% contribution to the
calculated neutron time spectra.

The dd fusion neutron spectra calculated for ortho-D2 and para-D2 solid targets are
quite similar. Small diﬀerences between the spectra are due to the diﬀerent energies and
strengths of the lowest resonant peaks, and to a slightly higher mean dµ energy in para-D2.
These diﬀerences can be clearly seen only in high-statistics experiments. Our calculations
do not conﬁrm a lack of strong resonant ddµ formation in solid ortho-D2, predicted in the
papers [20, 21]. In order to verify the theory it is necessary to perform measurements in
pure ortho-D2 and para-D2 solid targets under the same conditions.

Correlation dynamics between electrons and ions in the fragmentation of D2 molecules
by short laser pulses

We studied the recollision dynamics between the electrons and D+

2 ion to excited electronic states from there D+

2 ions following the tunneling
ionization of D2 molecules in an intense short pulse laser ﬁeld. The returning electron collisionally
excites the D+
2 can dissociate or be further ionized
by the laser ﬁeld, resulting in D+ + D or D+ + D+, respectively. We modeled the fragmentation
dynamics and calculated the resulting kinetic energy spectrum of D+ to compare with recent ex-
periments. Since the recollision time is locked to the tunneling ionization time which occurs only
within fraction of an optical cycle, the peaks in the D+ kinetic energy spectra provides a measure of
the time when the recollision occurs. This collision dynamics forms the basis of the molecular clock
where the clock can be read with attosecond precision, as ﬁrst proposed by Corkum and coworkers.
By analyzing each of the elementary processes leading to the fragmentation quantitatively, we iden-
tiﬁed how the molecular clock is to be read from the measured kinetic energy spectra of D+ and
what laser parameters be used in order to measure the clock more accurately.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The fragmentation and ionization of D2 by intense
optical laser ﬁelds has been an active area of theoret-
ical and experimental studies during the past decades
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In most of these experiments it was as-
sumed that the D2 molecule is ionized in the early phase
of the laser ﬁeld producing D+
2 ion which is subsequently
ionized by the laser. Mechanisms for the ionization of
D+
2 ion include bond softening (SO) [6], charge resonance
enhanced ionization (CREI) [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], in
addition to direct ionization by the laser ﬁeld. The dis-
sociation and ionization of D+
2 in the laser ﬁeld result in
D+ + D or D+ + D+, with characteristic kinetic ener-
gies reﬂecting the internuclear separation of the breakup
of D+
2 at the time when it is excited or ionized. Thus
bond softening and CREI, which produce distinct peaks
in the D+ ion kinetic energy spectra have been observed
experimentally and predicted theoretically. These peaks
can be understood without reference to the ionization of
D2 itself initially, i.e., the ionization of D2 and D+
2 can be
treated as two independent events. However, recent ex-
periments [2, 3, 4, 5] pointed out a new group of peaks in
the D+ ion spectra at the higher energy (about 5 eV to 10
eV per ion) which has now been attributed to the rescat-
tering process [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].
In the rescattering process, the electron which is released
by tunneling ionization is driven back by the laser ﬁeld
to collide with the residual D+
2 ion to ionize it or to ex-
cite it. If the D+
2 ion is excited, it can dissociate directly
or be further ionized by the laser.
In both cases, the
D+ ion will have kinetic energy (the reﬂection principle)

characteristic of the internuclear separation where the
ionization occurs. This paper is to examine all the ele-
mentary processes that lead to the emission of D+ ions
by the rescattering process following the initial tunnel-
ing ionization of the D2 molecule. The calculation will
be performed for D2 molecules only, but clearly the same
model can be applied to H2 with minor modiﬁcations.

In Sec. II we ﬁrst discuss all the elementary processes
that lead to the dissociation or ionization of D2 molecules
in a laser ﬁeld. Starting with the tunneling ionization of
D2, we address the following issues: (1) Calculation of the
ionization rates of D2 from its equilibrium distance us-
ing the molecular tunneling ionization (MO-ADK) theory
[25]; (2) The classical trajectory of the ionized electron
in the laser ﬁeld and the Coulomb ﬁeld of the D+
2 ion,
with initial longitudinal and transverse velocity distribu-
tions following the description of the ADK theory [23];
(3) The free propagation and spreading of the nuclear
wave packet after the tunneling ionization of D2 from
its equilibrium distance; (4) Semi-empirical formulae for
electron impact excitation cross sections of D+
2 from the
σg ground state to the ﬁrst few excited electronic states,
in particular, the ﬁrst σu and πu states. These cross
sections have to be evaluated at all values of internuclear
separations and for diﬀerent alignment angles of D+
2 with
respect to the laser polarization direction; (5) Evaluation
of tunneling ionization rates of D+
2 from the excited σu
and πu states at each internuclear separation; (6) Follow
the time evolution of dissociation and ionization dynam-
ics to extract the kinetic energy spectra of the fragmen-
tation products. While rates or cross sections for each
of these elementary processes have been formulated, in
the full calculation we only consider D2 initially aligned
perpendicular to the direction of the laser polarization.
In Sec. III, the resulting kinetic energy spectra of D+
are compared to the experiment of Niikura et al.
[4]

where D+ ions were detected without knowing whether
the other fragmentation product is a D or a D+. In con-
tradiction to the conclusion of this work where the main
peak in the D+ kinetic energy spectrum was attributed
to the dissociation of D+
2 following excitation to the σu
electronic state, we conclude from our calculation that
the main peak is due to the further ionization of the ex-
cited D+
2 by the laser. This has the consequence that
the molecular clock we read is at a diﬀerent time from
the one read in Niikura et al. [4]. We further analyzed
the contributions of the total kinetic energy spectra of
D+ resulting from the diﬀerent excited electronic states,
from dissociation or ionization, and from rescattering at
the ﬁrst return, the third return, or higher returns. The
simulated D+ kinetic energy spectra from ionization also
were compared to the recent experiment of Alnaser et al.
[26]. From our analysis, we conclude that the fragmenta-
tion of D2 can be used as a molecular clock based on the
rescattering dynamics. The clock can be read more ac-
curately if the laser pulse is chosen at the lower intensity
and with a shorter duration. With such a clock, the time
duration can be read with an accuracy of fraction of a
femtosecond without the attosecond laser pulses. Equiv-
alently this means that the distance between the two
nuclei can be read with an accuracy of fractions of an
Angstrom. This can be achieved experimentally by com-
paring kinetic energy spectra for experiments carried out
at diﬀerent mean laser wavelengths, or by comparing the
kinetic energy spectra of D+ and H+ from the fragmen-
tation of D2 and H2, respectively, in the same laser pulse.
We ﬁnish this paper with a summary and conclusion in
Sec. IV.

II. THE THEORETICAL MODEL

A. The elementary processes

The schematic of the physical processes leading to the
fragmentation of D+
2 ion following the ionization of D2
molecule in an intense laser pulse is depicted in Fig. 1.
The D2 molecule is ﬁrst ionized at t0 near the peak of the
laser pulse, releasing an electron into the oscillating laser
ﬁeld. At t1, the electron is driven back to the molecu-
lar ion, to excite the other electron in the ion to one of
the higher excited electronic states, or to ionize it. We
will be dealing with peak laser intensities such that the
returning electron does not have enough energy to ionize
D+
2 . In the meanwhile, the nuclear wave packet propa-
gates from its mean internuclear distance R0=1.4 a.u. at
t0 to R1=1.6 a.u at t1. Thus the electron impact excita-
tion probabilities of the molecular ion by the returning
electron have to be calculated for D+
2 with a vibrational
distribution χ2(R, t1). This distribution is indicated in
the second row of Fig. 1. Once the D+
2 is in the excited
state, represented by the curve labelled σu and πu in
Fig. 1, the D+
2 can dissociate directly to D+ + D, or it
can be further ionized by the laser at t′

to the formation of D+ ion by the dissociation or ionization

the laser. The second row shows the spreading of the vibra-
tional wave packet after the initial tunneling ionization. At
t0 the D2 molecule is ionized. The tunneled electron returns
2 ion at t1 where it excites D+
to rescatter with the D+
2 to
the excited σu or πu electronic states. The excited D+

tric ﬁeld of the laser returns to its peak value. If the D+
2
is ionized at t′
1, then it will fragment by Coulomb explo-
sion to produce D+ + D+ ions. The total released kinetic
energy for such a “two-step” process can be calculated.
The rescattering does not have to occur only at the
ﬁrst return time t1. Due to the attractive ﬁeld from the
molecular ion, the released electron can return to collide
with the molecular ion at later times, i.e., after more
than one optical cycle, following the initial ionization.
For example, the return can occur at t2 and t3, in the
second optical cycle, or at t4 and t5, in the third optical
cycle, and so on. At these later times excitation and
ionization occur at larger internuclear separations, thus
the kinetic energies of the fragmented D+ ion are smaller.
In general the returning probabilities become small after
three optical cycles. Following the general convention we
call t2 the second return and t3 the third return, etc...

An important feature of the elementary processes de-
scribed above is that the rescattering times ti and the
subsequent tunneling ionization time t′
i are relatively well
locked to the clock t0 of the initial ionization of D2. Since
tunneling ionization occurs only near the peak of the

states over the whole range of R. The rates are needed
for diﬀerent alignment of the molecules as well.

We calculated the tunneling ionization rates using the
recently developed MO-ADK model [25]. It was obtained
by extending the widely used ADK [27, 28] theory for
atoms in a laser ﬁeld to molecules.
In the MO-ADK
theory the ionization rates are given in semi-analytical
expressions. For a diatomic molecule in a parallel static
electric ﬁeld, the ionization rate for a valence electron is
given by

laser ﬁeld, t0 spans only a fraction of an optical cycle.
Similarly, ti and t′
i are also restricted to within sub-fs
accuracy. These precise clocks in turn deﬁne precise in-
ternuclear separations. For laser pulses with mean wave-
length at 800 nm, the mean internuclear distances Ri for
ti (i=1,3,5,7) are shown in Table I for H2 and D2. Note
that at t7, the center of the vibrational wave packet for
H+
2 has already bounced back from the outer turning
point, but not so for D+
2 . A classical estimate shows that
it takes 8.5 fs to reach its outer turning point. During
these later times, the wave packet spreads signiﬁcantly.
The clock or the mean internuclear separation can be
probed directly by the characteristic kinetic energy peaks
of the fragmented D+ ions. Changing the wavelength of
the laser clearly will change the clocks and the mean
internuclear separations. Replacing D2 by H2 will not
change the clock but will change the mean internuclear
distances.

To read the clock from the measured kinetic energy
of the fragmented ion, however, there are a number of
factors that make the clock “fuzzy”. First, the initial
tunneling ionization occurs over an interval of about 0.3
fs near the peak of the laser ﬁeld. The initial vibrational
wave packet, taken to be the ground vibrational wave-
function of D2, according to the Frank-Condon princi-
ple, has a width of 0.2 nm. This vibrational wave packet
will broaden as it expands to larger internuclear sepa-
ration. The electron impact excitation probabilities and
the MO-ADK rates also depend on internuclear separa-
tions. These factors would reduce the precision of the
clock such that distinct peaks in the kinetic energy dis-
tribution of the fragmented ions are not as clearly sepa-
rated. We model the rescattering process to check how
accurately the molecular clock can be read from the ki-
netic energy spectra of the fragmented ions for diﬀerent
laser parameters.

We now describe the models used for calculating the

rates and probabilities for each elementary process.

B. Tunneling ionization rates for molecules

We ﬁrst discuss how the ionization rates of D2 and D+
2
in the laser ﬁelds are calculated. From the rescattering
model above, we need the ionization rates for D2 from
the ground state, and for D+
2 from the excited σu and πu

tron in the asymptotic region and F is the ﬁeld strength.
In Eq. (2), the parameters Clm are determined from the
valence electron wave function of the molecule in the
asymptotic region. The laser peak power will be given
in units of I0 = 1014 W/cm2 and the mean wavelength
is 800 nm. If the molecule is aligned at an angle θ with
respect to the laser polarization direction, the ionization
rate is given by

atoms if l is taken to be the orbital angular momentum
quantum number of the valence electron. For diatomic
molecules, the summation over l is a consequence of ex-
panding the two-center electronic wave function in terms
of single-center atomic orbitals. The coeﬃcients Clm are
functions of R and depend on the electronic states of the
molecule.

For D2 at the equilibrium internuclear separation, the
parameters Clm have been calculated by Tong et al. [25].

2 as a function of internuclear

Within the range of its ground vibrational wavefunction,
it was found that the MO-ADK rates depend weakly
on R. It was also found that the major component of
B(m=0) in Eq. (2) is l=0, for D2, thus the MO-ADK
rates for D2 depend weakly on the alignment of the
molecule. The accuracy of the MO-ADK rates for D2
at the equilibrium distance had been checked previously
and found to be in good agreement with the result from
ab initio calculations [29].

We next consider the ionization of D+

2 in a laser ﬁeld.
Since the ionization rate depends sensitively on the ion-
ization potential, in Fig. 2 we show the electronic binding
energies Ei(R) at each R of the ﬁrst four electronic states
of D+
2 . The negative of the electronic binding energy is
the ionization potential. The total potential energy of
each electronic state is Ui(R)= Ei(R)+ 1/R. For peak
laser intensity in the range of 0.5-5 I0, estimate based on
the simple ADK theory or the more complete MO-ADK
theory shows that D+
2 in the σg state will not be ionized
by the laser except for R greater than about 5 a.u., while
for πu and πg states the D+
2 will be readily ionized be-
cause of the much smaller ionization potentials. Thus we
need to calculate only the MO-ADK rates of D+
2 in the
σu state as a function of the internuclear distance R.

In Fig. 3 we show the calculated MO-ADK tunneling
ionization rates at F=0.06 a.u. for the σu electronic state
of D+
2 , for R in the range of 1-6 a.u. and for alignment
angle θ=0◦ and 90◦. At θ=0◦, the MO-ADK rates have
been checked against the “exact” static tunneling ioniza-
tion rates calculated using the complex rotation method
in the two-center system [30]. The MO-ADK rates tend
to be somewhat higher, especially at small and large R
region. For R greater than 6.0 the σu ionization energy
is already very close to the ionization energy of atomic
H, thus the ADK ionization rates of H(1s) are used for
R > 6.0. In the actual calculation, the coeﬃcients Clm
are obtained for each R such that the MO-ADK rates
can be readily calculated for any ﬁeld strength, and any

alignment angle of the molecule using Eq. (3).

C. The rescattering model

Following the initial ionization of D2, a correlated elec-
tron wave packet and a vibrational wave packet are cre-
ated at t0. The initial vibrational wave packet is taken to
be the ground vibrational wavefunction of D2, assuming
that the ionization process is fast and the Frank-Condon
principle is valid. Due to the heavy mass of the nuclei,
the vibrational motion is not modiﬁed by the subsequent
laser ﬁeld. The time evolution of the vibrational wave
packet is thus described by

χ(R, t) =

Cvχv(R)e−iεv t,

Cv =

χg(R)χv(R)dR.

v
X

Z

Here {χv(R)} and {εv} are the vibrational wavefunction
and vibrational energy of D+
2 in the σg ground electronic
state, respectively, and χg(R) is the the ground vibra-
tional wave function of D2.

The rescattering model for describing the motion of the
ionized electron in the subsequent laser ﬁeld is modeled
similar to the method used by Yudin and Ivanov [22, 23]
for He. The ionized electron is treated classically, under
the combined force from the laser ﬁeld and the residual
Coulomb interaction from the D+
2 ion. For simplicity, the
latter is approximated by an eﬀective charge Zc=+1 at
the midpoint of the internuclear axis. To calculate the
trajectory of the ionized electron, we solve the equation of
motion (Newton’s second law), with the initial condition

that the ionized electron is at (x,y,z)=(0,0,z0) where z0
is the tunneling position from the combined potential of
the Coulomb ﬁeld and the static electric ﬁeld. The initial
velocity v is assumed to have a distribution from the
ADK model,

In this model, the tunneled electron is ejected isotrop-
ically with a Gaussian distribution in velocity, i.e., we
consider the ejected electron have initial velocity in both
the transverse and the longitudinal directions. For each
initial time t0 or phase φ0 that the ionized electron was
born, the classical equation of motion was solved to ob-
tain the trajectory. The distance of the electron from
the center of D+
2 ion is monitored for over seven opti-
cal cycles for longer pulses or till the end of the laser
pulse if the pulse is shorter. The distance of closest ap-
proach of the electron from the ion and the time when
this occurs for each trajectory are recorded. From these
data, the impact parameter b and the collision energy T
of the corresponding electron-ion impact (no laser ﬁeld)
excitation or ionization are obtained.

Figure 4 shows the probability distribution of ﬁnding
the returning electron with kinetic energy T measured in
the asymptotic region for a laser with peak intensity at
1.5 I0. If the residual Coulomb interaction from the D+
2
ion is neglected, the expected maximum returning energy
will be 3.17 UP = 29 eV, where UP is the Pondermotive
energy. The inclusion of Coulomb interaction increases
this peak energy to about 35 eV.

In Fig. 4 we show three groups of returning electrons.
In the ﬁrst group, the electron was born at t0 when the
laser ﬁeld has a positive phase φ0 (i.e., beyond the peak
ﬁeld). It was driven outward and then back by the os-
cillating laser ﬁeld to recollide with the D+
2 ion within
one optical cycle. This group is denoted by t1 where
the returning electron has peak current near 35 eV. The
second group labelled t2 denotes an electron which does

5

not collide with the ion at the ﬁrst return, but at the
second return about half a cycle later after the electron
reverse its direction again. The kinetic energy for this
group of electrons is smaller. The third group was de-
noted by t3+t−
3 . For the t3, the recollision occurs at the
third return. For the t−
3 group, the electrons were born
at a negative phase φ0 [24], i.e., before the laser reaches
the peak ﬁeld. These negative phase electrons do not
recollide with the ion in the ﬁrst optical cycle when the
ﬁeld change direction since they were accelerated by an
increasing ﬁeld right after birth. Due to the Coulomb fo-
cusing by the ion they collide with the ion at the third re-
turn. Without the Coulomb focusing the negative phase
birth would not contribute to the rescattering process.
In calculating the returning electron energy distribution
shown in Fig. 4 proper weights from the MO-ADK rates
and the initial velocity distribution of the tunneling elec-
tron have been accounted for. In Fig. 4 we did not show
the electron energy distributions from collisions occurred
at returns after two optical cycles. The general trend is
that at higher returns, the kinetic energy of the electron is
smaller and the probability of rescattering is also smaller.
In our calculations we have accounted for rescattering up
to seven optical cycles for the long laser pulses.

For each impact parameter b and kinetic energy T of
the returning electron, we need to calculate the electron
impact excitation and ionization cross sections of D+
2 at
each internuclear separation R. Diﬀerent from the He+
case, there are few experimental or theoretical data avail-
able for D+
2 . Thus we have to generate the cross sec-
tions needed semi-empirically. For each total cross sec-
tion σ(T ) at kinetic energy T, we assume that the prob-
ability for excitation or ionization at impact parameter
b is given by

The ﬁtted formula, when applied to He+, gives ionization
cross sections in good agreement with the theoretical re-
sults of Bray [31] for He+ as well. For D+
2 at the equi-
librium distance this formula also reproduces the recom-
mended ionization cross section from NIST [32]. In this
semi-empirical model, the molecular ion is treated as a
point particle, thus the ionization cross section is inde-
pendent of the alignment of the D+

2 ion.

For the excitation process, it is clear from Fig. 2 that
σu and πu states will be the dominant channels pop-
ulated via electron impact excitation from the ground
σg state since they have the lowest excitation energies.
There are no theoretical or experimental data available
for such cross sections as functions of internuclear separa-
tions. Thus we will employ semi-empirical ﬁtting proce-
dure as well. We assume that the excitation cross section
again can be ﬁtted in the form of Eqs (10) and (11) as in
ionization, except that ∆E now is the excitation energy
and the number 0.5 in Eq (10) should be replaced by the
excitation energy of the corresponding state in atomic
hydrogen. From the tabulated H(1s)→ H(2p) excitation
cross section in Bray [31], we obtained A = 0.7638, B=-
1,1759, C=-0.6706. The formula was further tested by
comparing the predicted excitation cross section with the
calculated one for e−+ He+(1s) → e−+ He+(2p). From
the total 1s → 2p excitation cross section, we can further
distinguish excitation cross section to 2p0 or 2p1, with
the direction of the incident electron beam as the quan-
tization axis. The relative 2p0 and 2p1 cross sections can
be calculated theoretically or experimentally from polar-
ization or correlation measurements. (Note: 2p−1 cross
section is identical to 2p1 cross section by symmetry.) In
Fig. 5 we show the relative cross sections of 2p0 to 2p1
from the calculation of Bray [33] for H, plotted against
scaled energy (with respect to the excitation energy). On

6

the same graph we display the same ratio for the excita-
tion of He from 1s2 to 1s2p1P o from the experiment of
Merabet et al. [34]. It appears that the both H and He
data fall on the same curve when the collision energy is
scaled with respect to the excitation energy. We ﬁt the
2p0 to 2p1 cross section ratio by

r(x) =

=

(12)

where x=T/∆E is the scaled kinetic energy. Since the
ratio for He does not diﬀer much from the calculated
ratio for H, this comparison convinces us to use the r(x)
in Eq. (12) to describe the ratio for D+
2 as well. The r(x)
indicates that m=0 is the dominant magnetic component
in the present interested energy regime.

To relate the 2p0 or 2p1 partial cross sections to the
excitation cross sections of σu and πu electronic states of
D+
2 , we need to know the alignment angle of the molecule.
If the molecule is aligned along the laser ﬁeld polariza-
tion direction (which is also the direction of the electron
beam), the 2p0 cross section is the excitation to σu state
and the 2p1 (2p−1) cross section is for the excitation to
the πu state. If the molecule is aligned perpendicular to
the laser polarization direction, then the role is reversed,
i.e., 2p1 (or 2p−1) corresponds to the cross section of the
σu excitation, and 2p0 cross section to the πu excitation.
For any arbitrary alignment angle θ of D+
2 , we assume
the total excitation cross sections to σu and πu are given
by

σ(σu) = σT (r0 cos2 θ + r1 sin2 θ)
σ(πu) = σT (r0 sin2 θ + r1 cos2 θ).

The semi-emipirically ﬁtted electron impact ionization or
excitation cross section formulae discussed so far are for
a free electron colliding with an atomic or molecular ion.
For the rescattering process, the two electrons in D2 ini-
tially are in the singlet state (S=0). Thus in principle,
one should just use singlet excitation or ionization cross
sections, instead of the spin-averaged cross sections. We
obtain the singlet cross sections from the total cross sec-
tion following the empirical formula derived in Yudin and
Ivanov [23] [their Eqns. (8) and (9)].

These empirical formulae allow us to calculate electron
impact excitation cross sections from σg to σu and to πu
states at each internuclear separation and at each align-
ment of the D+
2 ion. In Fig. 6 we compare the electron
impact excitation cross sections at the equilibrium dis-
tance to σu and πu states, for D+
2 ions lying parallel and
perpendicular to the incident electron direction which is
also the direction of the laser polarization, respectively.
When D+
2 is aligned parallel to the laser polarization, im-
pact excitation to σu is the dominant channel. The πu

where the parameters A = 0.17, B=1.53 are obtained by
ﬁtting the formula to the 1s → 2s excitation cross sections
of H. This cross section is assumed to be independent of
the alignment of the molecular ion.

With all the elementary cross sections available, we
can now calculate the probability distribution of exciting
D+
2 at a given internuclear separation R from the ground
σg state to a speciﬁc excited electronic state or to ioniza-
tion states by the returning electron where the returning
electron originates from the ionization of D2 molecule by
the laser over a half optical cycle. The probability distri-
bution is given by

R R

The subscript m stands for the excited states (σu, πu, σg)
or ionization. Pm(b, T ) is the impact excitation or ioniza-
tion probability from Eq. (8). In this expression, W is the
MO-ADK rate for ionizing D2 at the static ﬁeld Fcos φ,
where F is the peak ﬁeld strength of the laser. For each
φ, the tunneled electron leaves the molecule with an ini-
tial velocity v, with a distribution governed by Eq. (7),
i.e., eﬀects due to both the longitudinal and transverse
velocity distributions are included. For each initial ve-
locity and initial position of the tunneled electron, the
return time tr at the distance of closest approach, the
corresponding laser-free impact parameter b and kinetic
energy T are calculated, and the excitation probability
is also calculated. At each return time tr, the distribu-
tion of the vibrational wave packet, χ2(R,tr), is used to
calculate the probability of ﬁnding D+
2 at internuclear
separation R. In this expression the MO-ADK rates and
the impact excitation probabilities to σu and πu states
depend on the alignment of molecules. The other quanti-
ties are isotropic. For D2 initially aligned perpendicular
to the direction of the linear polarization of the laser, the
impact excitation probabilities at diﬀerent R’s over half
an optical cycle are shown in Fig. 7, where the peak laser
intensity is 1.5 I0. Note that excitation probability to πu
is the largest, but to σu is also signiﬁcant. On the other
hand, excitation to 2sσg excited state and direct ioniza-
tion by the rescattering electron are not important.

It is interesting to point out that the probability of ex-
citation in Fig. 7 shows distinct sharp peaks as a function
of R. To disentangle the source of these peaks, in Fig. 8
we examine the contributions to the πu excitation proba-
bility according to whether the return time tr falls within

cross sections are smaller due to two factors: (1) the πu
state has higher excitation energy, see Fig. 2; (2) the 2p0
state has larger cross sections than 2p1 for the electron
energies considered, see Fig. 5. The situation is diﬀerent
when D+
2 ion is aligned perpendicular to the laser polar-
ization direction. Fig. 6(b) indicates that excitation to
the πu state is actually larger than that to the σu state,
at least in the 20-80 eV energy region. Note that in the
experiments of Niikura et al. [3, 4] the H+
2 were
chosen to be perpendicular to the laser polarization di-
rection. They assumed that electron impact excitation
populates only the σu state, in disagreement with our
analysis.

2 or D+

The semi-empirical formulae presented above allow us
to calculate electron impact excitation cross sections to
σu and πu states averaged over the initially randomly
distributed D+
2 ions. We obtained the ratio of the cross
section of σu with respect to πu, and compared the result
with the ratio obtained by Peek [35] where the impact
excitation cross sections for diﬀerent internuclear sepa-
rations were calculated using the Born approximation.
The agreement is quite good, with the average cross sec-
tion for σu about a factor of two larger than for πu. The
absolute cross sections from Peek are larger since Born
approximation was used.

We also consider the small contribution from excitation

one, two, three or four optical cycles after the tunneling
electron is born. The excitation probabilities are larger
for returns within one or two optical cycles. Within the
ﬁrst two optical cycles, the nuclear wave packets remain
at small R with small spreading and the returning elec-
tron has more kinetic energy (see Fig. 4). For the higher
returns the nuclear wave packet moves to larger R and
spreads further and the smaller energies for the returning
electron render the excitation probabilities smaller.

We comment once again that with the inclusion of
Coulomb attraction on the motion of the rescattering
electron, the maximum returning electron energy is not
given by 3.17UP =29 eV for the present peak intensity,
but rather by 35 eV, as seen from Fig. 4. This has the
eﬀect of enhancing the excitation to the πu state as well.

For peak laser intensity of 1.5 I0 the results in Fig. 7
show that direct impact ionization of D+
2 by the rescatter-
ing electron is very small. The rescattering mostly popu-
lates D+
2 in the excited πu and σu states. The dissociation
of D+
2 from an excited electronic state would release a to-
tal kinetic energy given by U(R0)-U(∞), shared equally
by D and D+, respectively. According to Fig. 7, excita-
tion by the rescattering process peaks at characteristic
internuclear separations related to characteristic rescat-
tering time tr, thus measurement of the D+ fragment ki-
netic energies probes directly the recollision times. This
forms the basis of molecular clocks in the experiments of
[3, 4]. However, as shown in Tong et al.
Niikura et al.
[36] and in Alnaser et al.
2 ions are
still in the laser ﬁeld and they can be further ionized by
the lasers. Thus we need to calculate the kinetic energy
spectra of D+ resulting from Coulomb explosion after
these excited D+

2 ions are ionized by the laser.

F. Field ionization of excited D+

2 ion

In this subsection we consider the ionization of D+
2
from the excited electronic states. We emphasize that
we will consider peak laser intensity within 0.5-5 I0 only
where rescattering is important. In this intensity region,
D+
2 is readily ionized if it is in the πu excited state since
its saturation intensity is only about 0.1 I0 because of
small ionization energy. Thus we need only to calculate
the ionization rate of D+
2 from the σu state. If the ini-
tial excitation to σu occurs at R, the total accumulated
probability for ionizing an electron by the laser ﬁeld from
the σu state is

peak intensity 1.5 x1014 W/cm2, pulse length 40 fs.

Fig. 9 shows the expected ionization spectra from the σu
state if it is initially created at two diﬀerent R’s (R=1.6
and 2.1 a.u.), chosen to be the peak positions of the vi-
brational wave packet at the ﬁrst and the third returns.
Clearly, the early return releases more energy (higher en-
ergy peak). The spectra show many sharp peaks since
ionization occurs only when the laser ﬁeld is near its peak
intensity at every half cycle.

To obtain the total ionization spectra, we need to add
up contributions from initial ionization at all values of R,
i.e.,

This integration is important primarily only for ioniza-
tion from the excited σu state. For other excited elec-
tronic states, due to the high ionization rate, ionization is
complete within one cycle or less and we can set R = R′,
and the diﬀerential ionization spectra for these excited
electronic states are given by

reality, the dissociation comes from the σu excited state
only. In all other excited electronic states the D+

are immediately ionized by the laser in one optical cycle.

FIG. 10: D+ yield at several laser intensities for a 35 fs pulse
length. The experimental data are from Ref. [4] for 1.5 I0
where I0=1014 W/cm2. The peak values from experiment and
from theory for 1.5 I0 are normalized to each other. For peak
intensities of 1.0 I0 and 0.8 I0, the yields have been multiplied
by 1.4 and 3.0 respectively to have the same peak ion yield
height.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The kinetic energy spectra of D+ ions can be deter-
mined without any coincidence, as in the experiments of
Niikura et al. [3, 4], or by detecting the two D+ ions in
coincidence, as in the experiments of Staudte et al.
[2]
or in Alnaser et al. [26]. we will present our simulation
results for both types of experiments.

In the experiments of Niikura et al.

[3, 4], the ki-
netic energy of D+ ion was measured in the direction
perpendicular to the direction of laser polarization. The
measured D+ signals come from ionization and from dis-
sociation. Thus,

In Fig. 10 the experimental D+ kinetic energy spectra
from Niikura et al.
[4] are shown. The energy scale is
the total breakup energy, or twice the energy of the D+
ion. The experiment was performed for a pulse of 40 fs
and peak intensity of 1.5 I0. We have shown simulations
with the same laser parameters but with three peak laser
intensities, at 1.5, 1.0 and 0.8 I0. First we normalize the
peak height at 12 eV between theory and experimental
data at 1.5 I0. Since the peak positions do not vary with
laser intensity, we can normalize the calculated spectra
at the two other intensities as well, with a multiplicative
factor of 1.4 and 3.0 for the 1.0 and 0.8 I0, respectively.
If one compares the experimental spectra with the the-
oretical one calculated at the same 1.5 I0, clearly the

(26)

A. Non-coincident D+ kinetic energy spectra

high energy peak near 16 eV from the theory is too high,
while the theoretical spectra between 5 and 10 eV are
somewhat too low. However it appears that the discrep-
ancy can be reconciled if one takes into account of the
volume eﬀect in that the experimental spectra have to
be integrated over a volume where the intensities are less
than the peak value. The energy resolution and the ﬁnite
acceptance angles can all contribute to the smoother ex-
perimental spectra. One of course should also take this
“better agreement” with caution in view that the peak
intensity of the laser is often not known precisely.

One of the major goals of the simulation is to unravel
the origin of the structure in the kinetic energy spectra
which in turn would provide insight of the working of the
molecular clock. For this purpose, we show in Fig. 11
the calculated kinetic energy spectra, but separate the
contributions from dissociation and ionization, and from
rescattering occurred after one or two optical cycles, or
equivalently, from the ﬁrst (t1) or the third returns(t3),
at two laser intensities, 1.5 and 0.8 I0. At the higher
intensity, in this ﬁgure we notice: (1) ionization is much
stronger than dissociation; (2) the peak from the third
return (2nd cycle) is higher than from the ﬁrst return;

(3) The width of the peak from the ﬁrst return is broader
than the peak from the third return. The broadening is
a consequence of the factor dR/dU in Eqs. (26) and (28)
which is approximately given by R2. Another interesting
observation is that the peak position of the dissociation
spectra from the ﬁrst return almost coincides with the
peak position in the ionization spectra from the third
return. This shift is due to the binding energy of the
excited electronic states.

In Niikura et al.’s experiment [4] the peak at 12 eV
was attributed to originate from the dissociation of D+
2
via the σu curve at the ﬁrst return. In other words, this
peak reads the clock at t1. According to our simulation,
the peak comes from ionization following rescattering at
the third return, and this peak should read the clock at
t3.

Contributions to the D+ signal from dissociation do be-
come more important at lower laser intensity, as shown
in Fig. 11(b). Even at this intensity, the peak at 12 eV
still comes mostly from the ionization following rescat-
tering at t3 instead of dissociation following rescattering
at t1. Furthermore the third return peak is higher than
the ﬁrst return peak for either dissociation or ionization.
We remark that the spectra in Fig. 10 were calculated
including contributions up to four or ﬁve optical cycles
after the initial tunneling ionization and convergence of
the calculation was checked.

B. D+ coincident kinetic energy spectra

The D+ ion kinetic energy distributions in laser-D2 in-
teractions have been determined in coincidence measure-
ments where the two D+ ions were detected simultane-
ously by Staudte et al. [2] and more recently by Alnaser
et al. [26]. In the latter experiment, the branching ratios
of ionization with respect to dissociation had been mea-
sured as well, for peak laser intensities of 1-5 I0. Their
data for peak intensity of 2.8 I0 are shown in Figure 12.
The experiment used a 35 fs pulse with mean wavelength
of 800 nm. The D+ spectra are from Coulomb explosion
of ions at 60-80◦ with respect to the direction of the linear
polarization of the laser ﬁeld. In the ﬁgure we show the
result of our theoretical simulation for laser intensity of
2.0 I0. We found best overall agreement with the experi-
mental data at this intensity without considering volume
eﬀect and the fact that the theoretical calculation was
carried out for molecules aligned perpendicular to the
laser polarization while the experiments measured ions
coming out of 60-80◦ with respect to the laser polariza-
tion. The simulated spectra near the kinetic energy peak
region of 7-12 eV agree quite well with the data, but the
peak near 17 eV is more pronounced in the simulation.

A direct comparison of simulated kinetic energy spec-
tra with experimental data is complicated in general not
only by the volume eﬀect, the angular resolution of the
D+ product, but also the diﬃculty of knowing the peak
In Fig. 13 we show the yield
laser intensity precisely.

for making two D+ ions vs the total kinetic energy for
peak laser intensity from 1.0-3.0 I0. The calculations
were done for 35 fs pulse and mean wavelength of 800 nm
and with molecules aligned perpendicular to the laser po-
larization direction. Clearly the yield increases rapidly
with laser intensity. We further note that the peak po-
sitions in the spectra do change with laser intensity. In
particular, the main peak shifts to lower kinetic energy
at higher laser intensity. To understand the reason of
this shift, in Fig. 14 we separate the kinetic energy peaks
into contributions from the σu and from the πu curves,
and for rescattering occurring after one, two and three
optical cycles following tunneling ionization. Recall that
we consider D+ from ionization only here. At 2.0 I0, we
note the larger contribution comes mostly from ioniza-
tion of D+
2 in the πu state, although contribution from

11

σu is not negligible. From Fig. 14(b) one can clearly
identify the two peaks approximately at 10 and 12 eV
in Fig. 12 can be attributed to ionization from σu and
πu, respectively, for rescattering collision from the third
return. At 3.0 I0 (Fig. 14(a) ), due to the larger con-
tribution from the σu excited state, the peak positions
in the kinetic energy spectra are shifted to lower values.
Thus the sum kinetic energy spectra at the two higher
intensities look diﬀerent from those at lower intensities,
as seen in Fig. 13. Fig. 14(a) also shows that contribution
from the third cycle becomes relatively more important
at higher intensity. At higher intensity, the rescattered
electron has larger kinetic energy. Thus it takes more
time for the Coulomb attraction to bring the electron to
come near the ion for the rescattering to occur.

Figure 14 also illustrates how the working condition
for using rescattering model to measure the precise time
in a molecular clock can be limited. The kinetic energy
spectra from each excited electronic state of D+
2 has rela-
tively well speciﬁed and distinct peak positions from the
ﬁrst, 3rd and 5th returns. Such peak positions imme-
diately give information about the molecular clock since
each peak position does not depend on the laser inten-

sity. However, when ionization from σu channel also con-
tributes then the combined sum would shift the peak
positions as the laser intensity is changed, as shown in
Fig. 13. Thus to read the molecular clock accurately,
one has to choose laser intensity where only one of the
excited D+
2 electronic state contributes mostly to the ion-
ization signal. Failure to do so would compromise the
accuracy of the clock. Since the relative contributions
of the ionization signals from σu and πu are expected
to change with laser intensity and with the alignment of
the molecules, this also helps explain why the valleys in
the experimental spectra are usually less sharply peaked
than the ones simulated from the theory at a given peak
laser intensity.

C. Laser- H2 interactions and wavelength
dependence

Clearly the present method can be used to predict the
kinetic energy spectra if H2 is used as the target. The
only diﬀerence in H2 is that it has smaller reduced mass
such that the wave packet propagates faster, and thus
kinetic energy spectra will be shifted to lower energies.
If the wavelength of the laser is increased, the period is
longer and thus the kinetic energy spectra also will shift
to lower energies. We have applied the present theoretical
model to study the comparison of kinetic energy spectra
taken for H2 and D2 simultaneously [26], and also the
variation of the kinetic energy spectra when wavelength
was varied as in the experiment of Niikura et al. [4], see
Tong et al. [36].

cited electronic states and impact excitation and ioniza-
tion cross sections by the returning electron have been
obtained based on the MO-ADK theory and from semi-
empirical formulation, respectively. Following the initial
idea of Corkum and coworkers, we showed that the ki-
netic energy spectra of D+ in the higher energy region
(5 to 10 eV per D+ ion) can be used as a molecular
clock which can be read with subfemtosecond accuracy.
Through our detailed simulation, we concluded that the
dominant peak in the D+ kinetic energy spectrum is due
to the further ionization of the excited D+
2 following im-
pact excitation by the returning electron, and this exci-
tation occurs not at the ﬁrst return but mostly at the
third return. We have compared our simulation results
with the recent experiments of Niikura et al.
and of
Alnaser et al. with general good agreement. Further ex-
perimental studies in terms of dependence on laser wave-
length, pulse duration and alignment angles may provide
more critical test on the present theoretical model. From
the theoretical viewpoint, despite of the semi-empirical
nature of the present modeling, we do not expect any
meaningful pure ab initio quantum calculations viable in
the foreseeable future. The present model has the further
advantage that the mechanism for producing each indi-
vidual peaks in the kinetic energy spectra can be iden-
tiﬁed and the eﬀect of laser parameters can be readily
tested. On the other hand, the semi-empirical nature of
the modeling can claim its reliability only after it has
been exposed to more stringent tests from the experi-
ment.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In this paper we have provided a comprehensive study
of the elementary processes of the rescattering mecha-
nism leading to the fragmentation of D+
2 following the
initial tunneling ionization of a D2 molecule in a short
intense laser pulse. Ionization rates of D+
2 from the ex-

We report calculations designed to assess the ultimate precision of an atomic clock based on the
578 nm 6 1S0 → 6 3P o
0 transition in Yb atoms conﬁned in an optical lattice trap. We ﬁnd that this
transition has a natural linewidth less than 10 mHz in the odd Yb isotopes, caused by hyperﬁne
coupling. The shift in this transition due to the trapping light acting through the lowest order AC
polarizability is found to become zero at the magic trap wavelength of about 752 nm. The eﬀects
of Rayleigh scattering, higher-order polarizabilities, vector polarizability, and hyperﬁne induced
electronic magnetic moments can all be held below a mHz (about a part in 1018), except in the case
of the hyperpolarizability larger shifts due to nearly resonant terms cannot be ruled out without an
accurate measurement of the magic wavelength.

Optical atomic clocks oﬀer new opportunities for cre-
ating improved time standards as well as looking for
changes in fundamental constants over time, measuring
gravitational red shifts, and timing pulsars. Compared
with microwave atomic clocks, optical clocks have the
intrinsic advantage that optical transitions have a much
higher frequency and potentially much higher line-Q than
microwave transitions. Moreover, optical frequency comb
techniques [1] now permit diﬀerent optical frequencies to
be compared with each other at the 10−17 level or bet-
ter, and to be linked to microwave clocks as well. Optical
transitions in alkaline earth atoms oﬀer remarkable pos-
sibilities for clocks. In addition to the relatively sharp
1S0 →
1 intercombination line already in use [2], there
3P o
occurs the much sharper 1S0 →
0 line in odd isotopes.
This one-photon transition is forbidden in even isotopes,
but in odd isotopes acquires a weak E1 amplitude in-
duced by the internal hyperﬁne coupling of the nuclear
spin. Doppler and recoil shifts can be virtually eliminated
by conﬁning very cold atoms in an optical lattice trap.
This lattice will be Stark-free if it is produced by laser
beams tuned to the magic frequency where the ground
and excited states undergo the same light shift, leaving
the clock transition unshifted and relatively insensitive
to the laser polarization.

Katori [3] has pointed out these advantages for 87Sr,
and the 5 1S0 →
0 transition in this isotope has re-
cently been observed [4]. Also, Sr atoms have been held
in an optical lattice at the laser wavelength appropri-
ate for a Stark-free 5 1S0 →
1 transition, and this
transition has been observed free of Doppler and recoil
shifts [5]. The magic frequency for the Sr clock has been
evaluated recently in Ref. [6] and it has been measured

5 3P o

in Ref. [7]. In Ref. [6] an estimate of systematic uncer-
tainties for Sr also has been carried out.

1 line or the 6 1S0 →

Ytterbium has two stable odd isotopes, 171Yb and
173Yb, which also appear to be excellent candidates for
an atomic standard, using the 6 1S0 →
0 transition at
the convenient wavelength 578 nm. The atoms are read-
ily trapped into a MOT operating on either the strong
6 1S0 →
1 intercombina-
tion line and in the latter case have been cooled to µK
temperatures by Sisyphus cooling [8]. Also, these iso-
topes have been successfully conﬁned in an optical dipole
trap [9]. In this paper we present a calculation of the nat-
ural linewidth of the clock transition, which turns out to
be less than 10 mHz, and also a calculation of the Stark-
free wavelength of an optical lattice trap for the clock
transition. This wavelength turns out to be about 752
nm, reachable with adequate power by a tunable Ti:Sa
laser. We also estimate the size of the polarizability due
to higher magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole optical
moments. In addition, we estimate the Rayleigh and Ra-
man scattering rates in the optical lattice which can limit
the coherence lifetime of the clock transition. Finally, we
compute the small but important hyperﬁne-induced Zee-
man shift in the excited state and the vector light shift
which can cause a small Stark-shift dependence on the
polarization of the trapping light.

Our results indicate that a light intensity of 10
kW/cm2 would create a convenient trap depth of 15 µK
at the magic wavelength, while perturbations to the clock
frequency could be held below the mHz level (10−18 rel-
ative shift) – with one possible exception. Larger shifts
due to accidental near resonances in the hyperpolarizabil-
ity cannot be ruled out without an accurate measurement

of the magic wavelength.

All the calculations reported in this paper have been
carried out using the relativistic many-body code de-
scribed in Refs. [10, 11, 12]. The employed formalism is
a combination of conﬁguration-interaction method in the
valence space with many-body perturbation theory for
core-polarization eﬀects. The eﬀective core-polarization
(self-energy) operator is adjusted so that the experi-
mental energy levels are well reproduced.
In addition,
the dressing of the external electromagnetic ﬁeld (so-
called core shielding) is included in the framework of the
random-phase approximation. In the following we refer
to this many-body method as CI+MBPT. For Yb, the
CI+MBPT method has an accuracy of a few per cent
for electric dipole matrix elements and magnetic-dipole
hyperﬁne constants [13, 14]. Unless speciﬁed otherwise,
we use atomic units (

In the proposed design, the Yb atoms are conﬁned to

stant, the laser ﬁeld shifts the clock transition frequency

We have carried out the calculations of the E1 a.c. polar-
izability using the CI+MBPT method. We summed over
the intermediate states in Eq. (2) using the Dalgarno-
Lewis-Sternheimer method [15]. The results of the calcu-
lations for both 6 1S0 and 6 3P o
0 states are shown in Fig. 1.
The two dynamic polarizabilities intersect at ω∗ = 0.0606
a.u. At this “magic” frequency the lowest-order diﬀeren-
tial light-shift, Eq. (1), vanishes. It is worth noting that
at ω∗ the sum (2) for the ground state is dominated by
0 level by the 6s7s 3S1

with Q(Jλ) being relevant multipole operators [16]. Typ-
ically, the E1 polarizability (2) overwhelms this sum.
Compared to the E1 contribution, the higher-order mul-
tipole polarizabilities are suppressed by a factor of
(αω)2J−2 for EJ and by a factor of α2(αω)2J−2 for MJ
multipoles. We veriﬁed that at the magic frequency there
are no resonant contributions for the next-order E2 and
M1 polarizabilities and we expect α(E2,M1) . 10−6α(E1),
[6]. At the same time we no-
similar to the case of Sr
tice that a core-excited state 4f 13(2F ◦
7/2)5d5/26s2 J = 5
may become resonant with an excitation from the 6 3P o
0
level. The relevant M 5 polarizability is highly sup-
pressed, and we anticipate that the magic frequency will
be only slightly shifted by the presence of this state.

1 and 6s8p 3P o

Higher-order correction to the diﬀerential frequency
shift, Eq.(1), arises due to terms quartic in the ﬁeld
strength
E0. This fourth-order contribution is expressed
in terms of a.c. hyperpolarizability γ(ω). The expres-
sion for γ(ω) [17] has a complicated energy denominator
structure exhibiting both single– and two–photon reso-
nances. While for the ground state there are no such res-
onances, for the 6 3 P o
0 a two-photon resonance may oc-
cur for 6s8p 1P o
J intermediate states. Due to
theoretical errors in calculations of the magic frequency
we can not reliably predict if the two-photon resonances
would occur. Since the resonance contributions may
dominate γ(ω), we can not provide a reliable estimate
of the fourth-order frequency shift. The estimate may be
carried out as soon as the magic frequency is measured
with suﬃcient resolution. As a possible indication of the
eﬀect on the clock frequency, we notice that for Sr [6]
the resulting correction to the energy levels was a few
mHz at a trapping laser intensity of 10 kW/cm2. This
systematic uncertainty can be controlled by studying the
dependence of the level shift on the laser intensity [5].

The 6 3P o

0 state decays due to an admixture from J = 1

states caused by the hyperﬁne interaction.
In this pa-
per we restrict our attention to the hyperﬁne interac-
tion due to the nuclear magnetic moment µ. We write
this interaction as Hhfs =

eters: for 171Yb, the nuclear spin I = 1/2 and magnetic

µ =

where IL is the intensity of laser. At the magic frequency
ω∗ the values of a.c. polarizability for both states are
equal to 160 a.u. (see Fig. 1). For a laser intensity of
10 kW/cm2, the resulting rate is in the order of 10−3
sec−1. As to the Raman rates, there are no Raman tran-
sitions originating from the ground state. The ﬁnal states
for transitions from the 6 3P o
0 are the J = 1, 2 sublevels
of the same 6 3P o
J ﬁne-structure multiplet. We estimate
this rate by approximating the relevant second-order sum
with the dominant contribution from the 6s7s 3S1 inter-
mediate state. The resulting Raman scattering rate is
also in the order of 10−3 sec−1 for 10 kW/cm2 laser.

The total magnetic moment of the Yb atom is com-
posed of the nuclear and electronic magnetic moments.
Disregarding shielding of externally applied magnetic

For J = 0 levels there is no tensor contribution for the

where for J = 0, F = I and M is the magnetic quan-

a formalism of quasi-energy states [17] we arrived at an
expression for αA
γF (ω) which contains two dipole and one
hyperﬁne operator in various orderings and double sum-
mations over intermediate states. Analyzing these ex-
pressions, we ﬁnd that the vector polarizability of the
63P o
0 state is much larger than that for the ground state,
as in the case of Sr [6]. For Sr, Katori et al. [6] estimated
the vector polarizability by adding HFS correction to the
energy levels of intermediate states in Eq. (2). Our anal-
ysis is more complete and we ﬁnd that the dominant ef-
fect is not due to corrections to the energy levels, but it is
rather due to perturbation of the 63P o

ment on optical polarization is not an extreme one, and
in the special case of a 1D optical lattice could be relaxed
signiﬁcantly by orienting the quantization axis (deﬁned
by the external magnetic ﬁeld) perpendicular to the trap
axis.

In conclusion, we have analyzed the possibility of cre-
ating a highly precise optical clock operating on the
6 1S0 →
0 transition in odd isotopes of atomic Yb.
According to our calculations, the natural linewidth is
about 10 mHz, and the magic wavelength for producing
zero Stark shift of this transition in an optical lattice trap
is about 752 nm. We have examined possible sources of
shifts and broadening due to both the optical trapping
ﬁelds and any magnetic ﬁelds, and ﬁnd they should not

perturb the clock above the 10−18 level, except for possi-
ble larger near-resonant terms in the hyperpolarizability.
An accurate measurement of the magic wavelength will
be needed to settle this last question.

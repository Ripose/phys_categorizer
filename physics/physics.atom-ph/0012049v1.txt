Cooling gases with L´evy ﬂights:

In the last ten years, the generalized central limit theorem established by Paul L´evy
in the thirties has been found more and more relevant in physics. Physicists call
’L´evy ﬂights’ random walks for which the probability density of the jump lenghts
x decays as 1/x1+α with α < 2 for large x. We give here a glimpse of L´evy
ﬂights in physics through two examples, without going into technical details. We
ﬁrst introduce a simple toy model, the Arrhenius cascade. We then present an
important physical process, subrecoil laser cooling of atomic gases, in which L´evy
ﬂights play an essential role.

1 Introduction

The ’usual’ central limit theorem (CLT) is an essential tool in physics and in other sciences.
Indeed, one often knows the probability density f (x) of a quantity x associated with single
events. Then, one wants to derive the probability density f (XN ) for a sum XN

the ’generalized’ CLT, if 0 < α < 2, the density of XN (properly renormalized) still tends
to a stable law, which is not a gaussian but a L´evy law. After Mandelbrot, we call ’L´evy
ﬂight’ a random walk in which the probability density of jump lengths is given by Eq. (2)

The generalized CLT was already available in the thirties but, surprisingly, it has had
a limited inﬂuence on physics for a long time. Most physicists were certainly not aware of
it and those who were aware probably doubted that inﬁnite average values
or second
moments
could make sense in a real phenomenon. Note that few cases which come
under the generalized CLT were known, but they remained isolated cases (such as the
density of ﬁrst return times τ in one dimension which decays as 1/τ 3/2 for large τ ’s).

In the recent years, it has been more and more recognized that the generalized CLT
could shed an interesting light on many physical processes: random walks in solutions
of micelles [OBL90], turbulent and chaotic transport [SZK93, SWS93], glassy dynam-
ics [Shl88, BoD95], diﬀusion of spectral lines in disordered solids [ZuK94], thermodynam-
ics [TLS95, Tsa95, ZaA95], granular ﬂows [BoC97], laser trapped ions [MEZ96, KSW97]
... For reviews, see [Shl88, BoG90, KSZ96, Tsa97].

The interest of the physics community for the generalized CLT seems to be stimulated

by two important arguments.

First, the phenomena obeying only the generalized form of the CLT, i.e. those with
asymptotic power laws for f (x) with α < 2, exhibit a statistical behaviour which is

1For simplicity, any sum of independent events is called a ’L´evy sum’ below.
2If hx2i is ﬁnite, we say that f (x) is a ’narrow’ probability density.
3We then say that f (x) is a ’broad’ probability density.

markedly diﬀerent from the behaviour of the phenomena obeying the usual CLT. It is
thus important to identify whether a physical process comes under the generalized form
of the CLT (in the ﬁrst place to avoid the use of natural but irrelevant concepts, such as
the average value, derived from the usual CLT). This is illustrated in section 2 with the
simple model of the Arrhenius cascade.

Second, the generalized CLT provides an eﬃcient tool for the quantitative study of
some physical problems. This is illustrated in section 3 with a L´evy ﬂight theory of
laser cooling of atomic gases. In this case, it is worth noting that the ideas derived from
the generalized CLT have had practical consequences, leading to more eﬃcient cooling
strategies and to record low temperatures.

Finally, the generalized CLT also provides a useful qualitative insight for some random

walks even when it is not strictly valid. This is discussed brieﬂy in section 4.

Note that this contribution presents the point of view of a physicist and, as such, might not be

rigorous on all mathematical aspects.

2 The Arrhenius cascade

We present the model of the Arrhenius cascade in section 2.1, which is shown to exhibit
an unexpected statistical behaviour in section 2.2, analyzed with the generalized CLT in
section 2.3. This toy model presents generic eﬀects of the generalized CLT in physics.

2.1 The model

We consider a physical system placed in the potential landscape schematized in ﬁgure 1
and submitted to thermal ﬂuctuations. This model is called here the Arrhenius cascade.
It is inspired from studies of disordered systems, like glasses relaxing towards low energy
states [Shl88, BoD95], which obey similar equations.

Figure 1. The Arrhenius cascade.

The potential U (x) is a tilted random ’washboard’. It presents n local minima or ’wells’,
labelled by i, separated from the next minimum i + 1 by a potential ’hill’ of random height
Ui (the Ui’s are independent variables). We assume an exponential probability density

where U0 is the average height of the potential hills. The variable x may be a position
coordinate or any coordinate of the system.

f (U ) =

(3)

At any time, the physical system is trapped in one of the local potential wells. Due to
thermal ﬂuctuations, the system performs sudden jumps from one well to the other one
downwards. The global tilt of the potential hill U (x) is large enough to prevent the system
from performing upward jumps. Therefore, the system can only cascade downwards. The
trapping time τi in the well i is related to Ui by the Arrhenius law4:

where τ0 is a characteristic time, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.
We consider a gedanken experiment in which the experimentalist wants to know the
average trapping time in a single well, but can only measure the time tn needed to go
through all the n wells of the system:

τi = τ0 eUi/(kBT ) ,

tn =

Xi=1

To reduce the measurement uncertainty, he can repeat m times his measurement of tn. We
assume that, between each measurement, the realization of the disorder changes, i.e. the
numbers U1, ...Un change (and thus τ1, ...τn change accordingly). His estimation τexp(N )
of the average trapping time will therefore be:

2.2 Behaviour of the Arrhenius cascade

Simulated measurements of τexp(N ) are represented in ﬁgure 2 for two diﬀerent temper-
atures. For a temperature T = 3U0/kB, τexp(N ) converges nicely to the average value
when N increases, after exhibiting reasonable ﬂuctuations at small N . This is the
x
h
i
expected, standard behaviour.

For a lower temperature T = 0.5U0/kB, the behaviour of τexp(N ) is markedly diﬀer-
ent. The measured τexp(N )’s do not seem to converge towards any constant value but
rather to diverge in a very ﬂuctuating way with increasing N . A detailed analysis would
reveal that the tn’s also ﬂuctuate very much from one measurement to the other. This
unusual statistical behaviour would puzzle most experimentalists: large ﬂuctuations and
irreproducibility are usually considered as the indication of a problem in the experimental
procedure, arising from poorly controlled parameters. But here, one would ﬁnd that the
experimental setup works apparently well 5.

4In a realistic model, τi is not deterministically ﬁxed by Ui and the expression (4) gives only the average
value of τi. Taking into account the ﬂuctuations of τi for a given Ui would not change qualitatively the
discussion presented here.

5A closely related situation has recently appeared in a quantum tunneling problem. See section 4.

multiplied by 30 to be more visible.

2.3 Application of the generalized CLT

Let us see how the generalized CLT can shed light on the previous observations. We
ﬁrst easily calculate the probability density f (τ ) of the trapping times. It is given by the
relation f (τ )dτ = f (U )dU , which leads immediately to

f (τ ) = α

Having a power law for f (τ ), the probability densities of τexp(N ) at large N are provided

In the low temperature case (T = 0.5U0/kB), on the contrary, we have α = 0.5 which
is smaller than 1. The usual CLT does not hold anymore and the speciﬁc features of the
generalized CLT will play a crucial role. The generalized CLT tells us that we should

i=1 τi/N 1/α and that the density f (ZN ) tends to a L´evy law
consider the quantity ZN =
Lα(ZN ) at large N . This theorem has several important physical consequences: scaling
of the L´evy sums, domination of the L´evy sums by a single term and large ﬂuctuations of
the L´evy sums (most of these consequences are presented in [BoG90]). We only treat here
the case α < 1 (and not 1
2) for which the consequences of the generalized CLT
depart most strongly from the ones of the usual CLT. These consequences are:

Thus, the size of the system and the number of measurements play a non trivial role
in the measured values, an unusual situation in physics.

however large N might be (Eq. (9) is valid within prefactors that do not depend on

signature of L´evy statistics in a physical problem (see ﬁgure 3 below).

It can be used cleverly in physical experiments as a ’L´evy microscope’: by mea-

implicitly, for instance in studies of quantum tunneling [RoB84].

i=1 xi ﬂuctuates as much as a single term, when α < 1. This

is a direct consequence of the domination of the sum by a single term. It can also
be seen as a consequence of the fact that the tail of the L´evy law Lα(ZN ), which
determines the ﬂuctuations, decays as 1/Z 1/α
N , exactly as the tail of f (x). This
explains the highly ﬂuctuating τexp(N ) obtained in ﬁgure 2 as being intrinsically due
to the type of involved statistics and not to some technical experimental problem.
Thus, ﬂuctuations do not vanish as usual with the increase of the size N of the
statistical sample. The sums XN retain an intrinsically large irreproducibility. This
is in contradiction with a traditional motivation for applying statistical methods: to
go beyond the irreproducibility of individual events in order to obtain quasi-perfect
reproducibility for large ensembles of events. However, the generalized CLT still
allows for some predictibility in the statistical sense, since it predicts the stable form
of the probability density of ZN .

Physics has incorporated two new types of randomness during this century: quan-

out of ﬂuctuations in L´evy ﬂights can also be recognized as an important type of
randomness7.

6Such ’anomalous’ scaling with the system size appears in some complex phenomena like phase transi-

tions near a critical point. What is striking here is to obtain such scaling in a very simple problem.

7J.P. Bouchaud speaks of a ’science of irreproducible results’. B. Mandelbrot uses the term ’wild

randomness’.

3 Subrecoil laser cooling of atomic gases

In the Arrhenius cascade (section 2), a sum of N independent terms was directly measured
and the generalized CLT could be applied directly to analyze the results. In this section,
we proceed a step further by studying a richer physical problem, called subrecoil laser
cooling. In this case, L´evy sums —and their properties dictated by the generalized CLT—
play an essential role, although they are not measured directly.

We introduce subrecoil laser cooling in section 3.1. In section 3.2, we show that power
law densities of time variables appear, which implies the non-ergodicity of the process.
In section 3.3, the generalized CLT is used to get some insight on the cooling eﬃciency.
In section 3.4, quantitative predictions are derived, using the ’sprinkling density’. In sec-
tion 3.5, we indicate how the insight provided by the generalized CLT enables to optimize
the cooling strategy.

The starting point of the approach presented here has been presented in [BBE94] and

[Bar95]. A detailed description of the theory will appear in [BBA99].

3.1 Subrecoil laser cooling

Laser cooling of atomic gases is based on the momentum exchanges between photons and
atoms. In standard (not subrecoil) laser cooling, laser conﬁgurations and atomic transitions
are carefully chosen so that these momentum exchanges lead to a friction force. This
friction force damps the thermal atomic momenta p, thereby reducing the momentum
spread (standard deviation) δp of the atomic gas, which is equivalent to reducing the
eﬀective temperature T deﬁned by

kBT = δp2/M

(10)

where kB is the Boltzmann constant and M is the mass of the atoms. Temperatures
commonly achieved in the last ten years are in the range of a few microkelvins, 8 orders of
magnitude below room temperature. This has opened exciting new possibilities for atomic
and quantum physics and has been a key ingredient in the realization, in 1995, of a new
state of matter called Bose-Einstein condensate. The 1997 Nobel prize of physics was
attributed to S. Chu, C. Cohen-Tannoudji and W. Phillips for their contributions to laser
cooling.

Standard laser cooling mechanisms are fundamentally limited to temperatures larger
than the so-called ’recoil temperature’. Indeed, among the momentum exchanges between
atoms and photons, some —the ones due to spontaneous emission— occur in a random
direction. Each spontaneous emission of a photon by an atom thus results in an uncon-
trollable random recoil of the atomic momentum ~p by a quantity ¯h~k, where ¯h~k is the
momentum of a single photon. Therefore, the standard deviation δp of the atoms is ex-
pected to be always larger than ¯hk. This implies (cf. Eq. (10)) laser cooling temperatures
T larger than the recoil temperature deﬁned by TR = (¯hk)2/(kBM ). The recoil tempera-
ture TR is on the order of one microkelvin for the conﬁgurations frequently used.

To sum up, the randomness of spontaneous emission, which is essential for the cooling
since it provides a dissipative contribution to the atomic evolution, is also harmful to
the cooling since it implies a limit temperature. As spontaneous emission of photons by
atoms placed in laser light seems unavoidable, the recoil temperature was for some time
considered as an absolute limit for laser cooling.

Subrecoil laser cooling, i.e. T < TR, is however possible. Indeed, although spontaneous
emission of photons is an intrinsically random quantum process, it can be partly controlled.
The key idea is to create a spontaneous emission rate R(p) which depends on the atomic
momentum p (ﬁgure 3) and which vanishes at p = 0. This was ﬁrst proposed and realised
in 1988 [AAK88, AAK89] using a nice quantum eﬀect called a ’dark resonance’, because
a resonance occurs at p = 0 which prevents the spontaneous emission. Today, record
low temperatures reached experimentally with dark resonances approach TR/1000, which
corresponds to a few nanokelvins only.

Figure 3. Principle of subrecoil cooling. a) The spontaneous emission rate
R(p) vanishes at momentum p = 0. b) The atoms perform a momentum
random walk and accumulate in the vicinity of p = 0.

One can follow the evolution of an atom with an initially non-zero momentum p. The
spontaneous emission rate8 R(p) being large, the atom will spontaneously emit photons9
and therefore its momentum will change in a random way. This random walk will eventu-
ally lead by chance the atom in the vicinity of p = 0 where the spontaneous emission rate
is very small (see ﬁgure 3). There, the atom stops exchanging momentum with photons
and it remains so-to-speak ’trapped’ in what is called a ’dark state’. The time τ (p) of
residence at momentum p is

τ (p) =

1
R(p)

,

(11)

the time interval between two spontaneous emissions. If this residence time is long enough,
the atom keeps the same small momentum till the end of the experiment. If not, it emits
a spontaneous photon, which starts a new momentum diﬀusion process and gives to the
atom another chance to reach the vicinity of p = 0. Thus atoms accumulate in the vicinity

8The spontaneous emission rate R(p) can be simply seen as a diﬀusion coeﬃcient that has the peculiarity

of varying with the momentum p.

9Before each spontaneous emission, the atom absorbs a laser photon. The recoil eﬀects of photon

absorption, which is a deterministic process, are not essential here and are therefore ignored.

of p = 0 in long-lived states: a cooling eﬀect occurs. This cooling relies on a random walk
of the atomic momentum, unlike standard laser cooling which rests on friction forces.

The most important question for a cooling process is to determine the typical momen-
tum δp at the end of the random walk or, equivalently the temperature T (cf. Eq. (10)). It
is diﬃcult to answer it with the usual analytical or numerical methods of atomic physics10
because very diﬀerent momentum and time scales are present in the problem. A conjec-
ture was proposed in 1988 in which the interaction time θ, deﬁned as the time the atoms
interact with the lasers, plays a crucial role. Consider an atom reaching a momentum p
such that the residence time τ (p) is larger than the interaction time θ. This atom will
thus keep its momentum p till the end of the experiment and will be detected with this
momentum p. The conjecture consists in assuming that only the atoms such that

keep their momentum till the end of the experiment. Obviously, this can not be strictly
true: some atoms will reach a small momentum p after a signiﬁcant time t has elapsed
from the beginning of the interaction with the lasers so that, for them, the condition to

stay at momentum p would rather be τ (p)
≥
is the relevant criterion for the trapping of atoms. This predicts that a momentum peak
will form with a width δpθ given by

−

θ

Moreover, it can be shown that the residence time τ (p) varies as

Introducing this relation into Eq. (13) gives the conjectured momentum scale δpθ which
is reached after an interaction time θ:

or, for the temperature Tθ ∝

(δpθ)2 (cf. Eq. (10)),

This result is both interesting and surprising. Interestingly, it predicts that the tem-
perature can be reduced towards lower and lower values when the interaction time θ is
increased. The recoil temperature limit, which arises in standard laser cooling from spon-
taneous emission, is no more a limit here. Here indeed, spontaneous emission is present
0, but spontaneous emission stops
to create a random walk that brings the atoms to p
when the atoms reach a small enough momentum. Surprisingly, there does not seem to be
any limit for the cooling.

in one particular case, analytical solutions based on the usual methods have been
found [AlK96, SSY97]. Numerical approaches have also been developped [CBA91] using a new type of
quantum simulations.

This has motivated a series of experiments with longer and longer interaction times

TR/40 in 1994 [BSL94, Bar95] and Tθ ≃
interaction times allowed to reach Tθ ≃
in 1997 [SHK97], establishing a new temperature record each time. Moreover, these ex-
periments agree well with the conjectured temperature dependence of Eq. (16).

However, one obviously needs a better understanding of what determines the temper-
ature Tθ. A related question is the proportion of cooled atoms: can a random walk with
no driving force lead to an accumulation of all the atoms in the vicinity of p = 0? Is
there rather only a small proportion of cooled atoms? How does this fraction vary with
the interaction time θ and with the number of dimensions of the random walk? As we
will see below, random walk techniques and the generalized CLT provide answers to these
questions.

3.2 Trapping time densities and non-ergodicity

Recently developped quantum simulations [DCM92, DZR92, Car93, CBA91] allow to
follow the momentum random walk of a single atom in the process of subrecoil cool-
ing [CBA91, BBE94, Bar95]. An example of such a random walk is represented in ﬁg-
ure 4. We see how the random evolution of the atomic momentum sometimes leads to
p
0 states where the atom remains for a long time because the spontaneous emission
rate R(p) = 1/τ (p) vanishes in p = 0: this is the principle of subrecoil cooling at work.

at large scale, a fractal property typical of a L´evy ﬂight.

More importantly, ﬁgure 4 presents an interesting statistical feature that triggered the
L´evy ﬂight approach of laser cooling. The single largest residence time τmax amounts to
70 % of the total time θ while the atom has occupied 4000 diﬀerent momentum states

during this total time. Thus a single event dominates a sum of a large number of events,
which is an indication of a L´evy ﬂight.

Is there really a L´evy ﬂight in the problem? Let us estimate the probability density f (τ )
ptrap; +ptrap]
of trapping times τ , deﬁned as the times spent by an atom in an interval [
called the ”trap” of size ptrap smaller than the size ¯hk of a random momentum step11. The
probability density ρ(p) for an atom reaching the trap to fall in a state of momentum p
can then be considered as independent of p (in one dimension):

Thus, if we consider as a ﬁrst step that the interaction time θ is the sum of trapping
times τi with the density (18)12, the time θ is indeed a L´evy sum, whose behaviour is
dictated by the generalized CLT with α < 1. We have a L´evy ﬂight in time, which imme-
diately accounts for the domination of a single trapping event in ﬁgure 4 (see section 2.3).

There is a deep physical consequence of this L´evy ﬂight, the absence of ergodicity. The
ergodic hypothesis, an important ingredient in statistical physics, is the assumption that
time averaging of a physical quantity yields the same result as ensemble averaging. Time
averaging requires following a particle over a time much larger than all characteristic times
of the problem. This is impossible here. Indeed, as the time θ gets larger, larger trapping
time scales (up to θ) appear and the time averaging procedure does not converge. This is
reﬂected in the fact that we have a L´evy ﬂight on a time variable τ 13, with inﬁnite average
trapping times. Thus, subrecoil cooling is a non-ergodic process. The non-ergodicity is
associated to the absence of cooling limits. The cooling goes on for ever because larger and
larger trapping times τ (p), corresponding to lower and lower momenta p, can be reached
with increasing θ.

3.3 Trapping, recycling and the generalized CLT

The history of an atom over a time θN can be seen a series of N trapping times τi
interrupted by N times ˆτi spent out of the trap14. The times ˆτi are the usual ’ﬁrst return
times’. We also call them ’recycling times’ because the atoms coming out of the trap are
given another opportunity to reach the trap, they are ’recycled’.

Thus, the interaction time θN writes as

θN = τ1 + ˆτ1 + ... + τN + ˆτN = TN + ˆTN ,
11Under these conditions, the trapping times τ (p) are simply the residence times τ (p) of Eq. (11) and

(19)

Eq. (14) in the region [−ptrap; +ptrap].

12We neglect here the times ˆτi spent outside the trap. These will be taken into account in the following

section.

13Thus, the same non-ergodic properties occur for the Arrhenius cascade at law temperatures (see sec-

the associated random walk in time, a standard method for these problems.

is the total recycling time. Both TN and ˆTN are sums of independent variables. The
application of the generalized CLT to these sums gives in a simple way a qualitative
answer for the proportion of cooled atoms, as we discuss now.

Consider ﬁrst the case in which the spontaneous emission rate R(p) tends to a non-
vanishing constant at large p. Then, at large p, we have a standard random walk with
a constant diﬀusion rate. For a 1D problem, the probability density ˆf (ˆτ ) of ﬁrst return
times ˆτ is known to decay at large ˆτ as

ˆf (ˆτ )

1
ˆτ 1+ ˆα with ˆα =

It thus decays exactly in the same way as f (τ ). According to the generalized CLT, for
large N ’s, the sums TN and ˆTN behave as

TN ∼
ˆTN ∼
ˆTN : the atoms spend a ﬁnite
Therefore, for long times (cf.
large N ’s), one has TN ∼
fraction of their time in the trap and a ﬁnite fraction outside the trap. We thus expect the
proportion of cooled atoms to tend to a constant, strictly between 0 and 1. More elaborate
calculations conﬁrm this non-trivial result.

N 1/α = N 2 ,
N 1/ ˆα = N 2

·

Consider now the case in which a friction mechanism is added to prevent the atoms to
diﬀuse to too large momenta p. This friction conﬁnes the momentum diﬀusion in a ﬁnite
zone. In this case, ˆf (ˆτ ) is a narrow probability density with a ﬁnite average value. Thus,
according to the usual CLT:

ˆTN ≃

(25)

Comparing this to Eq. (23) which is still valid here, one has

TN ≫
for large N . This implies that all the atoms will be cooled, which is again conﬁrmed by
more elaborate calculations.

(26)

ˆTN

More complicated cases can be considered by including diﬀusion in 2 or 3 dimensions
or by including the ’Doppler eﬀect’ which modiﬁes the rate R(p) at large p. In each case,
the generalized CLT provides the asymptotic behaviours of the sums TN and ˆTN which
yield immediately the qualitative asymptotic proportion of cooled atoms.

3.4 Momentum distribution

Up to now, we have presented mostly qualitative results. We want to sketch here how
some quantitative results are obtained.

(probability density)

The main features of the cooling process are given by the momentum distribution
(p, θ) of trapped atoms at time θ. This momentum distribution
(p, θ) writes as an integral over the times tl at which the atoms enter the trap for the

(p, θ) = ρ(p)

The quantity ρ(p) is the probability density for an atom entering the trap to reach the
momentum p (in one dimension, we have seen in Eq. (17) that ρ(p) = 1/(2ptrap)). The
quantity SR(t) called here the ’sprinkling density’ is the probability density for an atom to
return into the trap at time t, regardless of the number of times the atom has entered the
τ f (τ ′)dτ ′ is the probability that an atom remains
trap before. The quantity ψ(τ

at large times. This is a signature of non-ergodicity: at large times, the density of return
events go to 0 because the longer and longer τi’s or ˆτi’s which tend to appear slow down
the diﬀusion. Such a process has a ’history’: the measurement of SR(t) at any time tells
when the diﬀusion has started.

3.5 Optimizing laser cooling with the generalized CLT

A remarkable outcome of the usual CLT is that the statistical behaviour of L´evy sums XN
at large N is determined only by two parameters,
. Thus, the detailed features
i
of f (x) can be forgotten if one is interested only in the large N properties of the L´evy
2, only the asymptotic power
sums. Similarly, with the generalized CLT in the cases α

law behaviour of f (x) is relevant to determine the behaviour of L´evy sums at large N . For
a positive variable x, for instance, this power law is described by two parameters only, the
exponent α and the prefactor of the power law. This can provide a useful insight when
confronted to a complex physical phenomenon with many parameters: the generalized
CLT shows that the many physical parameters combine into only two relevant statistical
parameters.

Such an insight has been applied in practice to improve a subrecoil laser cooling mech-
anism called Raman cooling [KaC92]. Raman cooling, like the dark resonance cooling
described in section 3.1, rests on a p-dependent spontaneous emission rate R(p) analogous
to the one in ﬁgure 3a. The main diﬀerence is that the rate R(p) results from the su-
perposition of pulses that can be chosen nearly arbitrarily. This gives ﬂexibility to this
mechanism and makes it a good case study for cooling optimization. On the other hand,
the large number of parameters (
30 for the initially used sequence of pulses) to be
optimized makes it necessary to ﬁnd simplifying guidelines.

≃

By carefully using the generalized CLT, we have proposed a new very simple sequence
of pulses [RBB95]: it relies on 4 pulses only (compared to 14 initially); the shape of the
pulses is the simplest possible while the initially used pulses were sophisticated Blackman
pulses.

The results are eloquent. With the initially used sequence of 14 pulses, the temperature

4 Imperfect L´evy ﬂights

We have presented in sections 2 and 3 two examples where the generalized CLT applied
perfectly. However, there are many physical cases where the generalized CLT is useful
although the conditions to apply it are not, strictly speaking, mathematically fulﬁlled.
This may occur either because the asymptotic decay of f (x) is not purely a power law or
because f (x) is a truncated power law.

Let us ﬁrst discuss the truncation problem17, i.e. the cases in which f (x) decays as
1/x1+α for x < x0 and decays more rapidly for x > x0 so that
are ﬁnite. In
the mathematical sense, the usual CLT applies. However, due to the power law tail, the
convergence to the asymptotic gaussian for the probability density of the L´evy sums can be
extremely slow, being reached for N typically of 103 or larger [MaS94], while in most cases
for which the usual CLT applies, the approximate convergence to a gaussian is obtained

17In section 3, the sums TN =

i=1 τi were limited by the available interaction time θ which is also
a kind of truncation. However, this truncation of the sum itself by an experimental parameter (here the
interaction time, in other cases the system size) does not prevent the appearance of all the important
eﬀects of the generalized CLT; on the contrary, the fact that the truncation value, however large it may
be, has an eﬀect on the measured value is a signature of the generalized CLT. The truncations dealt with
in section 4 bear on the density f (x) itself and imply a departure from the generalized CLT.

5. As, in practice, one often deals with sums of a
moderately large number N of terms, the behaviour of the L´evy sums is often dictated
by the L´evy laws for relevant N values, while the gaussian behaviour is recovered only for
irrelevantly large N values.

Second, there are broad probability densities which decay only approximately as power
laws. An example is provided by broad lognormal distributions, which have of course a
ﬁnite second moment. They can be rewritten as power laws 1/x1+α(x) with a logarith-
mically varying exponent α(x). If the logarithmic part of α(x) is small enough, then the
generalized CLT gives at least some qualitative guidelines for the behaviour of the L´evy
sums. We have used such guidelines to study the tunneling of electrons through a thin
layer of insulator, a problem which has both basic and applied interests. The striking
ﬁnding related to the generalized CLT has been that the typical current density varies by
more than 200 depending on the scale at which it is measured [Bar97, DBB98, DHB98]
(see also [LaB93]), while the typical current density should be scale independent if there
were no tails in the probability density of the current.

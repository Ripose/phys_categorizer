In the Comment by M. Mackie et al. [arXiv: physics/0212111 v.4], the authors suggest that the
molecular conversion eﬃciency in atom-molecule STIRAP can be improved by lowering the initial
atomic density, which in turn requires longer pulse durations to maintain adiabaticity. Apart from
the fact that the mean-ﬁeld approximation becomes questionable at low densities, we point out that
a low-density strategy with longer pulses has several problems. It generally requires higher pulse
energies, and increases radiative losses. We also show that even within the approximations used
in the Comment, their example leads to no eﬃciency improvement compared to our high-density
case. In a more careful analysis including radiative losses neglected in the Comment, the proposed
strategy gives almost no conversion owing to the longer pulse durations required.

The authors of Ref.

[1] revisit our earlier work on
stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) from
an atomic to a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate [2].
They suggest that the disruptive role of dephasing due
to particle-particle interactions can be reduced by lower-
ing the initial atomic condensate density. This strategy
requires a simultaneous increase of the duration of the
Raman pulses. As a result the authors claim to obtain
improved conversion eﬃciency, which reaches about 51%
for the optimized density. This is about 5% larger than
[2], and is
the highest eﬃciency of
achieved by using a 100 times lower atomic density and
about 100 times longer pulse duration.

46% found in Ref.

∼

Apart from the fact that mean-ﬁeld theory becomes
questionable for describing low density condensates, we
start by emphasizing that any comparison of eﬃciency is
only meaningful within a well-deﬁned situation of equal
atom numbers and laser powers (or pulse energies) [3].
This is because the optimum eﬃciency is a strong func-
tion of maximum Rabi frequency. Given these con-
straints, together with increased radiative losses at longer
pulse durations, we show here that there are three signif-
icant problems with the results of Ref. [1].

Laser power. The ﬁrst problem is that a low density
strategy requires a higher laser power to obtain an equal
laser intensity, since the laser waist size must be enlarged.
This is due not only to the larger size of the condensate,
for ﬁxed atom number, but also to the fact that the ex-
periment becomes more sensitive to the inhomogeneity
in the AC Stark shifts from the photoassociation laser
beams, which set a practical lower limit on the beam
waists. If such high power lasers to implement the low
[1] are available, they can sim-
density strategy of Ref.
ply be utilized to increase the maximum Rabi frequency
in the original proposal of Ref.
[2] – which greatly in-
creases the conversion eﬃciency. Using fewer atoms, as

suggested in the Comment, invalidates the comparison.
Parameter normalization and optimization. The next
problem is that equations (1a)-(1c) of Ref.
[1] and the
parameters used do not correspond to those of Ref. [2].
The diﬀerence is in the starting value of the parameter
χ0 and the fact that the respective equations of Ref. [2]
contain an extra factor 1/√2 in front of this coupling
term. Hence, the comparison is made between diﬀerent
Rabi frequencies, not just a lower atomic density.

Thus, the results of the Comment should be compared
[2] obtained with √2
with uniform trap results of Ref.
times larger Rabi frequency Ω1 (see Eqs.
(6) of Ref.
[2]). In this case, simulation of the respective equations
[2] with a factor of √2 larger peak value of Ω1,
of Ref.
zero two-photon detuning, and the same original values
for the remaining parameters (i.e. higher atomic density
1014 cm−3, a pulse duration of T = 0.2 ms, and
ρ0 = 4.3
a 50 times larger peak value of Ω2 than Ω1) gives 67%
conversion eﬃciency. This is higher than the maximum
eﬃciency of 51% found in the Comment [1].

×

In other words, the claimed improvement in conversion
is obtained not just by altering the initial atomic density
and pulse duration, but by changing other parameter val-
ues as well. When directly comparable Rabi frequencies
are used, the relative eﬃciency is in fact worse in the
suggested low-density strategy.

×

We also point out that the conversion eﬃciency of 16%
1014 cm−3
seen in Fig. 1 of the Comment at ρ0 = 4.3
should not be confused with our result of 67% at the
same density. The reason for this seeming disagreement
is that the authors of the Comment use essentially a one-
parameter (density) optimization. This means that other
parameter values like pulse duration are not necessarily
optimized at all densities. For example, the pulse du-
103/χ0 in all cases, which for
ration is set to T = 5
1014 cm−3 gives T = 2.4 ms. In contrast to
ρ0 = 4.3

×

×

this, our original optimization procedure is carried out
with respect to three parameters – the pulse duration,
pulse oﬀset, and the two-photon detuning. The 67% eﬃ-
ciency obtained in our case uses an optimum pulse dura-
tion of T = 0.2 ms, which is much shorter than used in
the Comment at this density [4].

It should be noted that 67% eﬃciency is higher than
the maximum of 46% we found previously [2]. This is
simply due to the improved adiabaticity following ob-
tained at higher Rabi frequency.

Radiative losses. We now address the most detrimen-
tal outcome of the longer pulse durations employed in the
Comment. As the timescale for STIRAP is increased, in-
coherent radiative losses become increasingly important
due to additional radiative couplings that are ignored in
the model of Ref. [1]. We show here that once included
in the model, they can lead to dramatic losses of the
ground-state molecules. Our results for typical param-
eter values show almost zero ﬁnal population. Thus, in
the suggested case of 87Rb, the proposed strategy results
in a dramatic reduction rather than improvement in the
conversion eﬃciency.

There are two types of additional radiative couplings
that are neglected in the Comment: (1) couplings that
occur even within the simple three-level model, and (2)
couplings to other vibrational levels in the excited molec-
ular potential.

The couplings within the three-level model included
in our original paper [2, 5] are due to non-resonant in-
teractions of the two Raman lasers. These lead to the
following, more complete equations:

the atoms, excited molecules, and stable molecules in the
ground potential, respectively.

For the beneﬁts of the readers, we use the same no-
tations as in Ref. [1]. Here, the density-dependent cou-
pling χ describes free-bound transitions between atom
pairs and excited molecules due to the Raman laser at
frequency ω1, which is the second pulse in the coun-
terintuitive STIRAP sequence. The Rabi frequency Ω
describes the bound-bound transitions between excited
and ground-state molecules due the ﬁrst Raman pulse
at frequency ω2. In addition to these couplings, which
are the primary transitions in any STIRAP scheme, the
above equations include the coupling of atoms to excited
molecules due to the ω2-laser, and similarly the coupling
of excited and ground-state molecules due to the ω1-laser.
The respective coupling constants are ˜χ and ˜Ω, and in
the case of ∆ = δ = 0 these non-primary or ‘partner’
transitions are detuned by ω12.

self-consistently.

The reason for this dramatic result is that the newly
formed ground-state molecules are being still illuminated
by the laser ω1 during the second Raman pulse. As a

Thus, the characteristic time scale for losses is 1/Γef f ∼

are negligible for the much shorter (sub-millisecond)

One might argue that targeting lower-lying vibrational
levels in the ground molecular potential would give larger
detuning ω12, thus making Γef f smaller. This approach,
however, suﬀers from the fact the respective bound-
bound Franck-Condon overlap integrals typically become
smaller and hence give even smaller values of the Rabi
frequency Ω0. In addition, a detailed multilevel analysis

reveals that these lower lying levels do not correspond to
the most favorable case, once we take into account the
entire set of necessary conditions for eﬃcient conversion
(see Eqs. (48)-(54) and the typical parameter values in
Table IV of Ref. [2]). The reason for this is that increas-
ing the detuning ω12 will eventually bring the frequency
of one of the lasers (or both) to a nearby resonance in the
excited potential, thus giving rise to additional induced
losses just as in Eq. (4).

The induced molecular losses due to the couplings to
other vibrational levels in the excited potential can be
modeled by the following additional term in the right-
hand side of Eq. (3):

and the expressions for Γ(i)
2 are given by Eq. (43) of Ref.
[2]. Here, the most disruptive loss coeﬃcient is Γ(1)
2 which
is due to the bound-bound transitions during the sec-
400 s−1
ond Raman pulse (laser ω1). We take Γ(1)
here, which is more favorable than the value obtained in
Ref. [2]. This gives a characteristic time scale for losses
1/Γ(1)
2.5 ms, which is much shorter than the pulse
2 ≃
24 ms. Not surprisingly, the simulation of
duration T
Eqs. (1)-(3) with the additional loss term, Eq. (5), and
with ˜χ0 and ˜Ω0 set to zero, gives again almost zero ﬁnal
population of the ground-state molecules.

An examination of the conditions stated in Eqs. (48)-

[2] and of the characteristic values of the
respective coeﬃcients in Table IV reveals that these re-
sults could have been expected. The entries in lines 5 and

therefore the induced losses are not negligible. Similarly,
even the induced atomic loss coeﬃcient α(1) = 51 s−1
1.2 (with T = 24 s−1) and hence it cannot

be neglected either.

We should note that all of the calculations we pre-
sented have been carried out within a simpliﬁed model
of the molecular structure, which assumes an 87Rb2
molecule with a single ground and single excited elec-
tronic state. We include vibrational, but neglect rota-
tional and hyperﬁne structure. As such, our conclusions
– while correct qualitatively – can be further improved
for quantitative purposes. Nevertheless, in contrast to
the calculations of Ref.
[1], ours do include the impor-
tant physical eﬀects in a reasonably realistic way, within
the limitations of mean-ﬁeld theory. We feel that the gen-
eral conclusions we have presented, such as the poor scal-
ing of the molecular conversion eﬃciency with decreasing
density, and the lack of very substantial improvement in
conversion with increasing molecular binding energy, are
likely to be present in any STIRAP experiment with al-
kali dimers.

To summarize, the photoassociation strategy employed
in Ref. [1] requires higher laser powers and pulse energies.
Even neglecting losses, it does not lead to improvements
in eﬃciency relative to the original proposal, provided
the maximum Rabi frequencies are kept equal.
It also
fails to capture the physics of induced radiative losses
relevant for long pulse durations. The proposal of using
lower atomic densities and longer pulses for achieving
higher conversion eﬃciencies in atom-molecule STIRAP
gives in fact the opposite eﬀect, once these additional
loss channels are taken into account. We ﬁnd that with
typical parameter values, a more complete model results
in almost zero conversion, under the proposed conditions.

[3] The Rabi

frequencies chosen in the original proposal
would correspond approximately to a 100 µm waist and
1 W power per Raman channel, typical of current cw
Ti:sapphire laser beams. If the beam waist size is much
smaller than this, then its AC Stark shift becomes very
inhomogeneous, which creates new problems.

[4] It is possible that a better optimization procedure might
work better at lower densities, within the model employed
in the Comment. However, we have not investigated this in
detail, as the low density strategy will have to necessarily
employ longer pulse durations to maintain adiabaticity, in
which case the model itself becomes physically unrealistic

[5] Eq. (29) of Ref. [2] contains a typographical error. Here,
the exponential term exp(−iω12t) in the ﬁrst line should
read as exp(iω12t). The same term in Eq. (57) is correct.
In addition, in the caption to Table III, |I1,3| = 0.1 should
be replaced by |I2,3| = 0.1, and the quoted values of δ
should refer to −δ instead. The value of |I2,3| is correct
elsewhere in the text, and these typographical errors do
not aﬀect the results presented in Ref. [2].

[6] On evaluating the values of the parameters ˜χ0 and ˜Ω0, one
has to pay attention to the fact that these have to be cal-
culated in conjunction with χ0 and Ω0 and that they can
not be varied independently. The reason is that these cou-
plings originate from the values of the bare electronic Rabi
frequencies for the two transitions, Ω(el,0)

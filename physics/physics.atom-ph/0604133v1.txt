Abstract. In muonic atoms the Uehling potential (an eﬀect of a free electronic vacuum polarization loop)
is responsible for the leading contribution to the Lamb shift causing the splitting of states with ∆n = 0
and ∆l 6= 0. Here we consider the Lamb shift in the leading nonrelativistic approximation, i.e., within
an approach based on a certain Schr¨odinger equation. That is valid for low and medium Z as long as
(Zα)2 ≪ 1. The result is a function of a few parameters, including κ = Zαmµ/me, n and l. We present
various asymptotics and in particular we study a region of validity of asymptotics with large and small κ.
Special attention is paid to circular states, which are considered in a limit of n ≫ 1.

where m is the mass of the orbiting particle which is an
electron in a conventional atom and a heavier particle in a
muonic or exotic atom. However, details of the spectrum
and, in particular, the structure of the energy levels with
the same value of the principal quantum number n are dif-
ferent in diﬀerent kinds of atoms. For example, in muonic
atoms at low and medium Z the largest splitting between
states with the same n is the one for states with ∆l
= 0
(the Lamb splitting) which is essentially a nonrelativistic
eﬀect.

In the nonrelativistic approximation the leading con-
tribution to the Lamb shift in muonic atoms (i. e., the
Uehling correction) has been known analytically for a while
for certain levels [1], however, only numerical results used
to be quoted in the textbooks (see, e.g., [2]). A reason for
that is the complicated form of the analytic expressions.
For instance, in the simplest case of the ground state the
result is of the form [1]

are similar, but more complicated. They involve functions

and coeﬃcients similar to those in Eq.(1) depend on values
of the principal and orbital quantum numbers, n and l.

The mass of the orbiting particle m in a non-conventional

hydrogen-like atom is much above the electron mass me.
We consider here the vacuum polarization eﬀects for a
hydrogen-like atoms with an orbiting particle, which in
particular may be a muon (mµ ≃
1.5 Z), a
273 me; κ
pion (mπ ≃
κ
13 Z) etc. The relativistic eﬀects for those atoms are
quite diﬀerent for various reasons, while the result in the
leading nonrelativistic approximation is the same. Further
we do not distinguish between various possibilities of the
orbiting particles and mainly speak about a muon, but the
equations could be applied to any orbiting particle.

Savely G. Karshenboim et al.: Vacuum polarization in muonic atoms: the Lamb shift at low and medium Z

Analytic results have been known for some time even
for hydrogen-like atoms with a Dirac particle [3] and since
recently for the case of a Klein-Gordon particle [4]. They
are rather cumbersome, containing the hypergeometric func-
tion 3F2 and far from being transparent. For instance, the
relativistic result [3,4] for the nl states reads as a ﬁnite
sum over basic integrals

n dependence and a determination of a real parameter of
expansion are important to ﬁnd the range of validity of
various asymptotics.

Here we derive a general expression for the Lamb shift
at medium values of the nuclear charge Z. Finally the
vacuum polarization correction is presented in the leading
nonrelativistic approximation in the form

Meanwhile, muonic atoms oﬀer a special region of pa-

We ﬁnd in this paper asymptotics for low and high κn
and determine regions of their validity. We study in more
detail circular states and show that for them the low-κn
expansion is an expansion over n
κn = κ, while the high-
κn asymptotics is actually an expansion over n2/κ.

2 The Uehling correction in the
nonrelativistic approximation: general
consideration for the Lamb shift

Let us ﬁrst remind how the Uehling correction is calcu-
lated in a general case. The Lamb shift in muonic atoms
is a result of perturbing the Coulomb potential

Highly excited states in muonic and exotic atoms are
of particular interest for precision measurements because
they oﬀer a certain suppression of the interaction between
the nucleus and the orbiting particle. The n dependence of
theoretical expressions, even of the simplest asymptotics,
is not a trivial issue. One can see from expressions with
the generalized hypergeometric function 3F2 that while
the argument is κ2
n, the parameters are n dependent and
in fact in actual situations some are proportional to n.

In particular, the parametrical structure of asymptotic
results for high κn can be easily understood in the coordi-
nate representation since the characteristic radius of the
potential is the Compton wave length of an electron ¯h/mec
and the radius of atomic states is typically ¯hn2/Zαmc.
Thus, the actual expansion is in n/κn, rather than just
in 1/κn. A similar situation is with low κn. Study of the

which follows from Eq.(16), is known in simpler terms and
in particular in terms of elementary functions (see Eq.(1)).
The general expression (21) now presents a correction for
any states in terms of elementary functions. Such an ex-
pression is also very useful to derive various asymptotics
once we ﬁnd related asymptotics for F10(κ). Another way
of the Fnl presentation as a single ﬁnite sum can be found
in [9].

(see also [4])) is diﬀerent from the related integral I there.
While in the nonrelativistic limit, when ǫ = 0 and the

Ia,b,c+2ǫ(κ, ǫ).

We note that for integer a, b, c the result can be ex-
pressed in terms of elementary functions. Using recursive

κ values, because the problem is related to muonic and

easily arrive at a situation when κn = κ/n

The ﬁrst term of this expansion is obtained in [9] and
is in agreement with our expression. As one can see, the
series is in fact over n
κn = κ rather than κn. That sets
a condition for applicability of the low-κn asymptotics as
1/n. In particular, it means that the asymptotics

Eq.(33) cannot be applied for Rydberg states even for the
muonic hydrogen, i.e., for the smallest possible Z (Z = 1),

6 High n asymptotic behavior

We see that while we expand the generalized hypergeo-
metric function in terms of either κn or 1/κn, the real pa-
rameters of both expansions involve a factor of n directly.
That is due to the increase of the coeﬃcients of the κn-
or 1/κn- expansions with n which technically originates
from the expansion of the factor

in the basic integral Kabc(κn), while c = 2n.

30

We note that a consideration of high n is not unreal-
istic. For instance, in [neutral] antiprotonic helium for re-
alistic levels [10] we ﬁnd Z = 2, n
1,
1. One of the reasons to study high-n states is that
κn ≃
they very weakly interact with the nucleus, especially if a
value of l is also high. Such an immunity to the nuclear-
structure eﬀects is an advantage from both theoretical and
experimental point of view. Therefore and also because of
simpliﬁcations in calculations we consider below circular
or near circular states at n

Once we know the general expression (5) in terms of

the expansion is over nκn, and not over just κn).

n), while the smooth function changes
large κn (κn ≫
3/2 to ln(κ/n2). Because of
from being proportional to n−
so smooth behavior we expect that the asymptotics with
the explicit factor Eq.(45) can be successfully applied for
a somewhat larger region, however, their accuracy there
is unclear. Various asymptotics are compared to the exact
result for n = 100 in Fig. 1. In particular we see that an
explicit presentation of the factor of (κn/(1 + κn))2n re-
ally improves agreement between the asymptotics and the
exact solution.

8 Summary

Concluding, we have to brieﬂy discuss corrections to the
results derived. Since the parameter m/M (here M is the
mass of the nucleus) in muonic, pionic and other exotic
atoms is not as small as in conventional atoms, an impor-
tant question is the accuracy of our results obtained in the
external ﬁeld approximation, i.e. in the limit m/M = 0. In
antiprotonic atoms such eﬀects are even more important
than in the muonic case. The higher m/M corrections,
which are quite important for muonic atoms, can be easily
taken into account for the Lamb shift in the nonrelativis-
tic approximation by substituting the mass of the orbiting
particle m for the reduced mass mR = mM/(m + M ) in
Eq.(8) and κ for κR = ZαmR/me.

The functions Fnl are presented above for arbitrary nl
in a closed analytic form in various ways. Certain asymp-
1 for the
totics are also presented. The results at κn ≫
lowest states are summarized in Table 1. They are sim-
ple and transparent. The Lamb shift result in Eq.(16) is
obtained in the nonrelativistic approximation and is valid
for any hydrogen-like atom as far as the relativistic cor-
rections can be neglected. Some asymptotic results for the
n for some low ly-
splitting of levels with ∆l = 1 at κn ≫
ing states are summarized in Table 2.

We studied the applicability of naive low-κ and high-
κ asymptotics and found that the region where they are

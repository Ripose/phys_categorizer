Abstract.

New cross sections for the rotational excitation of H+

3 by electrons are calculated
ab initio at low impact energies. The validity of the adiabatic-nuclei-rotation (ANR)
approximation, combined with R-matrix wavefunctions, is assessed by comparison with
rovibrational quantum defect theory calculations based on the treatment of Kokoouline
and Greene (Phys. Rev. A 68 012703 2003). Pure ANR excitation cross sections are
shown to be accurate down to threshold, except in the presence of large oscillating
Rydberg resonances. These resonances occur for transitions with ∆J = 1 and are
caused by closed channel eﬀects. A simple analytic formula is derived for averaging
the rotational probabilities over such resonances in a 3-channel problem. In accord with
the Wigner law for an attractive Coulomb ﬁeld, rotational excitation cross sections are
shown to be large and ﬁnite at threshold, with a signiﬁcant but moderate contribution
from closed channels.

1. Introduction

Rotational excitation of positive molecular ions is a major mechanism by which
slow electrons lose energy in partially ionized molecular gas. The eﬃciency of this
process is a signiﬁcant parameter in various applications, for example the interpretation
of dissociative recombination experiments (Lammich et al
2003, Kokoouline and
Greene 2003) or the determination of the density and temperature conditions in the
diﬀuse interstellar medium (Lim et al 1999, Faure et al 2006). A good knowledge of
rotational (de)excitation cross sections is therefore required for a variety of molecular
ions and over a wide range of collisional energies and rotational levels.
In contrast
to neutral molecules, however, little attention has been given to the electron-impact

excitation of molecular ions. These are indeed more diﬃcult to study experimentally and
only a few theoretical treatments have been reported so far. The reference method for
computing electron-impact excitation cross sections has been the Coulomb-Born (CB)
approximation (Cho and Dalgarno 1974, Cho 1975, Dickinson and Mu˜noz 1977, Neufeld
and Dalgarno 1989). This approach assumes that the collisional cross sections are
entirely dominated by long-range interactions. The CB theory thus predicts that
transitions with ∆J=1 and 2 only are allowed for dipole and quadrupole interactions,
respectively. Recent ab initio R-matrix studies on several astronomically important
molecular ions have shown, however, that this prediction is incorrect and that the
inclusion of short-range interactions is crucial, particularly for ions with small (or zero)
dipole or transitions with ∆J > 1 (see Rabad´an et al
(1998), Faure and Tennyson
(2002b) and references therein).

These R-matrix studies were, however, hampered by the use of the adiabatic-
nuclei-rotation (ANR) approximation. The ANR theory is expected to become invalid
close to a rotational threshold because it neglects the rotational Hamiltonian (see, e.g.,
Lane (1980)). This leads to an ambiguous interpretation of the ANR energy because
the electron energy in the exit channel of a near-threshold inelastic collision is very
small while the assumption of rotational degeneracy sets this energy equal to that
of the entrance channel. As a result, if the ANR energy is interpreted (as usual) as
the initial kinetic energy, then excitation cross sections are non-zero at and below
In previous R-matrix works, this artefact was corrected by multiplying
threshold.
the ANR cross sections by the kinematic ratio k′/k, where k (k′) is the initial (ﬁnal)
momentum of the electron. This simple method, which forces the cross sections to
zero at threshold, is widely used in the case of neutral molecules (Morrison 1988).
The resulting cross sections, however, do not obey the proper threshold law, when the
molecular target has a nonzero charge. In the present work, near threshold rotational
excitation of H+
3 by electron-impact is investigated by comparing ANR cross sections
with independent calculations based on the quantum defect theory and rotational-
frame-transformation (MQDT-RFT) approach (Fano 1970, Chang and Fano 1972, Child
and Jungen 1990, Kokoouline and Greene 2003) To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
quantitative assessment of the validity of the adiabatic approximation for electron-
impact rotational excitation of a charged target molecule. The theoretical treatments
are introduced in the next section. Comparisons of cross sections obtained at diﬀerent
levels of theory are presented in section 3. Conclusions are summarized in section 4.

2. Theory

We consider the following process between an electron and a symmetric-top molecular
ion:

e−(Ek) + ION(JKM) → e−(E′

k) + ION(J ′K ′M ′),

(1)

where J is the ionic rotational angular momentum, K and M its projections along the
body-ﬁxed (BF) and the space-ﬁxed (SF) axes, respectively, and Ek (E′
k) is the initial

Near threshold rotational excitation of molecular ions by electron-impact

(ﬁnal) kinetic energy of the electron. The relation between Ek and E′

k is:

where the energy of the state (JK) is given in the rigid rotor approximation by:

E′

k = Ek + (EJK − EJ ′K ′),

EJK = BJ(J + 1) + (A − B)K 2,

3

(2)

(3)

with A and B being the rotational constants.
It should be noted that vibrational
energy splittings of H+
3 are much larger than rotational splittings, with the ﬁrst excited
vibrational level {011} being 0.3 eV above the ground vibrational level {000}. In the
following, we will assume that the initial and ﬁnal vibrational state of the ion is {000}
and that the incident electron energy is less than 0.3 eV.

2.1. ANR method

We follow the implementation of the ANR theory for symmetric-top molecular ions as
presented in Faure and Tennyson (2002b). The key quantities in this approach are
the T -matrix elements which are produced in the BF frame of reference and are then
transformed through the conversion of the BF asymptotic scattering amplitude to the
SF frame.
In this approach, the rotational Hamiltonian is neglected and there is an
ambiguity in deﬁning the BF asymptotic electron energy, Ebf , which can be taken
equal to the kinetic energy in the entrance (Ek) or exit (E′
k) channels, or even to some
other values (see Morrison (1988) and references for neutral targets therein). The usual
choice, however, is to take Ebf as the initial kinetic energy, Ek. The integral ANR
rotationally inelastic cross section for a symmetric-top molecule is then given by (Faure
and Tennyson 2002b):

lh,l′h′ are the BF T -matrix
elements belonging to the µth component of the pth irreducible representation (IR) of
the molecular point group, with h distinguishing between diﬀerent elements with the
same (pµl). The ¯b coeﬃcients are discussed, for example, in Gianturco and Jain (1986).
The T-matrix is as usually deﬁned in terms of S-matrix as

T = 1 − S

(6)

and the cross section can be expressed in terms of the SF S-matrix by the familiar
formula:

Near threshold rotational excitation of molecular ions by electron-impact

where Jtot = J + l is the total angular momentum.
It should be noted that the
ambiguous choice Ebf = Ek leads to excitation cross section that are non-zero below
threshold. A common method for forcing the cross sections to zero at threshold is
to multiply these by the ratio of the ﬁnal and initial momentum of the electron, k′/k
(Morrison 1988). This was used in particular in previous R-matrix works (Faure and
Tennyson 2002b). However, the ANR T -matrix elements still do not exhibit the proper
dependence on k′ in this limit, for an ionic target. Alternatives such as Ebf = E′
k are
possible but still should not give the correct threshold laws for the T -matrix elements.
Furthermore, the principle of detailed balance is not rigorously satisﬁed near threshold.
This will be further discussed in section 2.3.

The e−+H+

3 BF T -matrices were taken from the R-matrix calculations of Faure
and Tennyson (2002a). The geometry of the ion was frozen at its equilibrium position
corresponding to an equilateral triangle with D3h symmetry. The e−+H+
3 scattering
model was constructed using the four lowest target electronic states and the continuum
orbitals were represented using the GTO basis set given by Faure et al
(2002) which
include all angular momentum up to lmax = 4 and is optimized to span energies below
5 Ryd. As discussed in Faure and Tennyson (2002b), rotationally inelastic cross sections
were found to be entirely dominated by low partial waves, with more than 90 % arising
from l = 1, and ANR cross sections were obviously unaltered by augmenting them with
quadrupolar CB calculations for partial waves with l > 4. Collisional selection rules are
detailed in Faure and Tennyson (2002b).

2.2. MQDT-RFT method

3 scattering model is based on ab initio H+

We follow the implementation of the MQDT-RFT theory as presented by Kokoouline
and Greene (2003, 2004). The e−+H+
3 and H3
potentials independent from the R-matrix model presented above. In this framework,
originally developed for the dissociative recombination of H+
3 , ﬁrst, one constructs the
energy-independent SBF -matrix in a basis better adapted for BF (see Kokoouline and
Greene (2003, 2004) and references therein). The SBF -matrix depends on the three
internuclear coordinates Q and the projection Λ of the electronic orbital momentum on
the molecular axis. Thus, we deﬁne the elements of the scattering matrix as

hQ; Λ| ˆS|Q′; Λ′i = SBF

Λ;Λ′(Q)δ(Q, Q′).

(8)

The SBF -matrix in this representation is diagonal with respect to the rotational quantum
numbers Jtot, Ktot and Mtot of the whole molecule and the continuous coordinate Q. To
completely deﬁne basis functions |bi in the BF, in addition to Λ and Q, the rotational
quantum numbers Jtot, Ktot and Mtot must be also speciﬁed; for brevity they are omitted
in the above equation. For the matrix element SBF
Λ;Λ′(Q) we will also use the notation
hb| ˆS|b′i. The next step in the MQDT-RFT is to obtain the S-matrix in the basis
|si corresponding to the laboratory or SF coordinate system. In this basis, the good
quantum numbers are the vibrational quantum numbers (for example, {v1, vl2
2 }, if the
normal mode approximation is used) and rotational quantum numbers Jtot, J, K, M, l, m

Near threshold rotational excitation of molecular ions by electron-impact

deﬁned above.
In the following, we will not specify any other conserved quantum
numbers that are the same in the both bases, such as the total nuclear spin and the
irreducible representation of the total wavefunction. The SF S-matrix is determined by
carrying out a unitary transformation from the BF basis to the SF basis:

Ss;s′ =

hs|bihb| ˆS|b′ihb′|s′i ,

b,b′
X

(9)

where the summation indicates a sum over discrete indices and an integration over the
continuous coordinates Q. The explicit form of the the unitary transformation matrix
elements hs|bi is given in Eq.(27) of Kokoouline and Greene (2004).

The transformation of Eq. 9 is truly unitary only if the vibrational basis in the
SF representation is complete. In calculations, one always adopts a ﬁnite vibrational
basis set that is not complete. It should be suﬃciently large to represent properly the
vibrational states contributing to the process of interest.
In practice the vibrational
basis set is calculated within a ﬁnite volume, and one can impose outgoing-wave
(Siegert) boundary conditions at its surface to account for the fact that some of the
incident electron ﬂux can be diverted through the collision into dissociative channels, as
in Hamilton and Greene (2002) and Kokoouline and Greene (2003). The procedure
of transformation from the BF to SF representations described above is called the
rovibrational frame transformation in MQDT. It accounts for the coupling between
electronic, rotational and vibrational motion of the molecule. In contrast to the MQDT-
RFT approach, the rotational dynamics of the system is not included in the ANR.

The unitary transformation of the S-matrix from the body frame to the laboratory
frame, as described in the preceding paragraph, is similar in spirit to that described
by Chase (1956,1957). But one important physical diﬀerence is that, whereas the
Chase approximation was intended to be applied only in energetically open collision
channels, in the MQDT-RFT the transformed scattering matrix S includes (weakly)
closed channels as well. When the incident electron collides with a singly-charged
its kinetic energy is increased by 1/r0, and consequently
molecular ion of size r0,
scattering into weakly-closed channels is often an important class of pathways, even for
entrance or exit scattering processes that occur right at threshold with zero asymptotic
kinetic energy. Every such threshold has an inﬁnite number of Rydberg levels converging
to it. For this reason, the transformed S does not yet represent the physical scattering
matrix (Aymar et al 1996). In fact, it represents the actual scattering matrix Sphys only
in energy ranges where all of the channels |si are open for electron escape, i.e. where the
total energy of the system is higher than the energy of the highest relevant ionization
channel |si threshold. When at least one channel is closed, the physical scattering
matrix Sphys is obtained from S using the standard MQDT channel-elimination formula
(see Eq. (2.50) in Aymar et al (1996) or Eq. (38) in Kokoouline and Greene (2004) ).
3 DR studies carried out by Kokoouline and Greene (2003, 2004), the
treatment has been limited to the dominant p-wave component (l=1) of the incident
electron wavefunction because the p-wave has the largest contribution into the DR
cross-section. This partial wave also has the largest eﬀect on the rotational excitation

In the H+

Near threshold rotational excitation of molecular ions by electron-impact

probabilities considered in the present study. When all channels |si are open for
electron escape, the scattering matrix is energy-independent.
(This is within the
frequently-adopted approximation of energy-independent quantum defects, which can be
improved upon when necessary, as has been discussed, e.g., by Gao and Greene (1990).)
When there are closed channels that are coupled to open channels, the autoionizing
Rydberg series associated with the closed ionic channels introduce a strong energy
dependence into the physical scattering matrix. Consequently, the resulting cross-
sections reﬂect these autoionizing resonance features that are strongly dependent on the
energy. Examples of such energy dependences that arise in electron collisions with H+
3
are demonstrated below. These rotational autoionizing resonances have been thoroughly
studied in both experimental (Bordas et al
(1991)) and theoretical (Stephens and
Greene (1995), Kokoouline and Greene (2004)) studies of H3 photoabsorption processes.
MQDT-RFT calculations including the complete rovibrational frame transforma-
tion and the Jahn-Teller eﬀect have shown that the probability of rotational excitation
|S2| is weakly energy-dependent in the region between the {000} and {011} vibrational
levels (Kokoouline and Greene 2003). The Rydberg resonances present in the rotational-
excitation spectrum have in general small widths. However, for transitions involving
symmetries with more than two rotational channels, the rotationally inelastic probabil-
ities are actually nearly energy-independent only at electron energies above the highest
channel (all coupled rotational levels are open). For a 3-channel problem, there are
thus an inﬁnite number of purely rotational Rydberg resonances at electron energies
between the second and third channel thresholds. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 for the
transition (1, 1)→(2, 1) at Jtot = 2 (there is no p-wave Rydberg series attached to (3, 1)
at Jtot = 1). Note that for the reverse process (2, 1)→ (1, 1), all curves in Fig. 1 would
be simply shifted towards zero electron-impact energy, in accordance with the detailed
balance principle (see section 2.3).

It can be seen in Fig. 1 that the pure MQDT-RFT calculation (bottom panel) is in
very good agreement with the much more expensive rovibrational MQDT treatment (top
and middle panels). In the top panel, we observe the complicated structure introduced
by the inclusion of the vibrational motion at energies above the (3, 1) threshold. In this
energy range, there are many narrow resonances corresponding to vibrationally excited
states of bound H3 Rydberg states.
If one considers the integral over the resonance
region, however, these resonances do not change the probability signiﬁcantly. Thus, as
previously observed by Rabad´an et al
(1998) for diatomic ions, a detailed treatment
of vibrational motion is unnecessary to obtain reliable thermally-averaged rotational
excitation rate coeﬃcients of the type normally needed in astrophysical applications.
On the other hand, in the region between the (2, 1) and (3, 1) channels, Rydberg
resonances are found to increase the rotational probability by about a factor of 2 on
average, i.e., the value of 0.15 just above the (3, 1) channel increases discontinuously to
an averaged value of 0.29. Note that higher closed channels involving partial waves with
l > 1 are negligible. Physically it means that incident electrons in partial waves with
l > 1, for the energy range considered here, can not approach the ion closely enough to

A pure MQDT-RFT calculation is presented at the bottom, while the upper two frames

be able to excite it. From the MQDT point of view, it means that the quantum defects
for molecular states with l > 1 are close to zero. Indeed, calculated cross sections for
transitions with ∆J > 2 or ∆K 6= 0 are 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than those
with ∆J = 1, 2 and ∆K = 0 (Faure and Tennyson 2002b). Resonances due to these
low probability transitions do not therefore contribute signiﬁcantly to the cross section.
In the following, we will only consider 2- and 3-channel problems (i.e. transitions with
∆J = 1 and 2) and two possible energy ranges: above and below the highest channel
threshold.

2.2.1. Above the highest channel
threshold Since we have restricted the frame
transformation analysis in this paper to the purely rotational FT, the ionization channels
in the energy-independent scattering matrix Ss;s′ diﬀer only in their rotational quantum

Near threshold rotational excitation of molecular ions by electron-impact

numbers. The vibrational state is the same for all the channels, namely, the ground
vibrational state of the ion. Therefore, the integral over the vibrational coordinates
Q in Eq. (9) (or in Eq. (27) of Kokoouline and Greene (2004)) is the same for all
the matrix elements Ss;s′. Although the BF scattering matrix is not diagonal at all
geometries in the BF rotational quantum number Λ, the integral over the vibrational
coordinates Q is not zero only when Λ = Λ′. This is because the non-diagonal elements
of the BF matrix describe Jahn-Teller physics, which eﬀectively couples only vibrational
states belonging to diﬀerent irreducible representations. Therefore, the integrals over
the vibrational coordinates of the ground vibrational state can be viewed as an eﬀective
diagonal 3 × 3 or 2 × 2 scattering matrix with elements e2πi¯µΛ, where ¯µΛ represent the
quantum defects averaged over the vibrational state. They are very close to the H3
Born-Oppenheimer quantum defects at the minimum of the H+
3 potential surface. The
SF scattering matrix elements become in this approximation (Eq. (43) of Kokoouline
and Greene (2003)):

In all calculations below we have used ¯µ0=0.05 and ¯µ±1=0.39 for the p-wave quantum
defects, as in Kokoouline and Greene (2003). The above SF scattering matrix is energy
independent and describes the electron-ion scattering only for energies above the highest
ionization channel. The corresponding rotational probabilities for a set of symmetries
and nuclear spins can be found in Table VI of Kokoouline and Greene (2003). Finally,
the rotationally inelastic cross section is obtained as:

appropriate for this energy range is obtained from the matrix of Eq. (12) by the usual
MQDT closed-channel elimination procedure (Aymar et al
1996). To simplify the
formulae we omit here all indexes and superscripts other than 1,2, and 3. If channels 1
and 2 are open and channel 3 is closed the amplitude of the excitation 1 → 2 is given
by

where E3 is the ionization threshold energy of channel 3. The 1 → 2 excitation
probability is given by P1;2 = |Sphys

probability depends strongly on the energy owing to the Rydberg series of resonances

attached to channel 3. We have derived an analytical expression for the excitation
probability ¯P1;2 averaged over energy in this region. Since P1;2 is a periodic function of
β, we average over just one period [0, π], i.e. over just one unit in the eﬀective quantum
number of the closed channel 3:

Once these are added, we see that the integral in Eq. (16) can be simpliﬁed to give the
average excitation probability in the energy range of rotational autoionizing states as

¯P1;2 = |S2;1|2 +

|S3;1|2 |S3;2|2
|S3;1|2 + |S3;2|2 .

We can notice that the above formula is consistent with the fact that Rydberg
resonances are important when |S1;3|2 is comparable in magnitude with |S1;2|2 and |S2;3|2.
Thus, the larger |S1;3|2 is, the larger are the resonances and their average contribution
to the total excitation cross section. It should be also noted that the ratio

R =

¯P1;2
|S1;2|2

is actually independent of the quantum defects and is entirely controlled by Clebsch-
Gordan algebra. In the case of the (1, 1)→ (2, 1) transition, R is equal to 15/7, leading
to an analytically averaged value of ¯P1;2 = 0.33, to be compared with the numerically-
calculated average value of 0.29 (see Fig. 1). The accuracy of the present analytic
approach is therefore estimated to be of the order of 10 %.

Finally, we note that the present analytical averaging can of course be applied to
any SF S-matrices, in particular ANR S-matrices that would have been converted to
the SF frame of reference. In the following, however, the averaging procedure will be
implemented for MQDT-RFT probabilities only.

2.3. Detailed balance

The principle of detailed balance, which is the consequence of the invariance of the
interaction under time reversal, states that the transition probabilities |S1;2|2 and |S2;1|2
for a certain inelastic process |1i → |2i and its reverse |2i → |1i are equal at a given
total energy, Etot, deﬁned as:

Etot = Ek,1 + E1 = Ek,2 + E2,

where Ek,i is the electron kinetic energy and Ei is the target internal energy. Following
this deﬁnition, cross sections must obey the formula:

σ1→2(Ek,1)g1Ek,1 = σ2→1(Ek,2)g2Ek,2,

where gi is the statistical weight of the state i. At the MQDT-RFT level of theory,
detailed balance is rigorously satisﬁed, even with the above averaging of probabilities
over Rydberg resonances.
It should be noted, however, that this would not be the
case for the averaged formulae presented above, if cross sections or rate coeﬃcients
were averaged over resonances instead of probabilities. At the ANR level of theory, the
assumption of target-state degeneracy leads to transition probabilities that are equal at
a given kinetic energy. As a result, ANR cross sections obey the following formula:

(20)

(21)

(22)

1→2 (Ek)g1 = σANR
σANR

2→1 (Ek)g2,

and Eq. (21) is generally not satisﬁed at the ANR level. This problem again reﬂects the
ambiguity in deﬁning the BF asymptotic electron energy. In particular, if this energy
is taken equal to the entrance electron energy for an excitation process and to the exit
electron energy for the reverse deexcitation process, then Eq. (21) is rigorously satisﬁed
at the ANR level. Moreover, when the transition probability is energy independent, as
it is at the MQDT-RFT level for energies above the highest channel, then cross sections
obey both Eqs. (21) and (22). This will be further discussed in the next section.

3. Results

Rotationally inelastic cross sections are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 for upward rotational
transitions in ortho- and para- H+
3 . In Fig. 2, the rovibrational MQDT result is compared
to the MQDT-RFT and ANR calculations for the transition (1, 1)→ (2, 1). Note that the
full MQDT-rovibrational and MQDT-RFT results include contributions from Jtot = 1
and Jtot = 2. We can ﬁrst notice that the agreement between MQDT-RFT and ANR
cross sections is extremely good above the highest (3, 1) channel, with relative diﬀerences
of less than 2 %. In this energy range, we also notice in the full MQDT treatment a
number of narrow resonances that correspond to vibrationally excited states of bound H3
Rydberg states, as observed in Fig. 1 for Jtot = 2. Between the (2, 1) and (3, 1) channels,
the ANR cross section is found to signiﬁcantly underestimate the averaged cross section
owing to the appearance of large purely rotational Rydberg resonances. In this energy
range, the MQDT-RFT calculation includes the analytical averaging of probabilities

over the Rydberg series and it provides, as expected, a good averaged description of the
full MQDT rovibrational result. We also notice that despite a large eﬀect of resonances
on the excitation probabilities for Jtot = 2 (a factor of 2, see Fig. 1), the resulting eﬀect
on the cross sections summed over Jtot is signiﬁcantly lower, with an enhancement of
about 30 %. This of course was expected since the dominant contribution to the cross
section arises from a symmetry (here Jtot = 1) with no purely rotational Rydberg series.
Below the energy of the lowest ionization channel, the excitation cross section in any
MQDT treatment is identically zero, or strictly speaking, the cross-section is not deﬁned
there because the electron cannot be at inﬁnity when all channels are closed. This
behavior of the cross-section agrees with Wigner’s laws (Wigner 1948, Stabler 1963).

It is important to note that the ANR excitation cross section follows the correct

threshold law for an inelastic electron collision with a positive ion:

This actually reﬂects the weak energy dependence of the ANR T -matrix elements, in
agreement with the MQDT-RFT results (see section 2.2). As explained in section 2.1,
however, the ANR cross sections are actually non-zero below threshold owing to our
deﬁnition of the ANR energy. In Figs. 2 and 3, cross sections were therefore multiplied

(

(24)

where Eth = EJ ′K ′ − EJK is the threshold energy. This ad-hoc correction is the simplest
way of forcing the cross section to zero below threshold while keeping a ﬁnite value
at threshold, in agreement with the above theoretical considerations. The eﬀect of this
’Heaviside correction’ can be checked carefully in transitions with no rotational Rydberg
series, that is, those with ∆J > 1. In Fig. 3, we can thus observe that all ANR cross
sections for transitions with ∆J = 2 are in excellent agreement with those obtained at
the MQDT-RFT level down to threshold. Of course, the exception is the (2, 1) → (3, 1)
transition in which closed-channels eﬀects occur at energies between the (3, 1) and (4,
1) channels and are of similar magnitude as in (1, 1) → (2, 1). Note that we actually
observe a slight increase of closed channel eﬀects as the initial J increases. Rydberg
resonances were thus found to enhance the (4, 1) → (5, 1) cross section by about 45 %
at energies between the (5, 1) and (6, 1) channels.

The results presented in Figs. 2 and 3 show that despite the important contribution
of closed-channel eﬀects in transitions with ∆J = 1, the ANR theory is generally quite
successful in predicting rotational cross sections for molecular ions down to threshold.
This result was actually predicted by Chang and Temkin (1970), although the role of
closed-channels was not considered by these authors. In their study, Chang and Temkin

Near threshold rotational excitation of molecular ions by electron-impact

(1970) showed that the correction term to the adiabatic equation (Eq. 2.1 of their paper)
is of the order of the ratio of the electron mass m to that of the nuclei M. They concluded
that the ANR theory should be accurate down to an energy:

Ek ≫ (m/M)Eth,

(25)

that is, very close to threshold. It is interesting to notice that the same authors estimated
that the lower limit in the case of neutral target molecules is much larger and is given
by Ek ≥ 1.65Eth. This huge diﬀerence reﬂects the inﬂuence of the strong Coulomb ﬁeld
in the case of ions.

We ﬁnally note that the above Heaviside correction does not of course correct for
the breakdown of detailed balance within ANR theory. As discussed in section 2.3, a
possible method to enforce detailed balance is to use a diﬀerent deﬁnition of the ANR
energy for excitation and deexcitation processes. However, as the present ANR T -matrix
elements are nearly energy independent, detailed balance is actually almost satisﬁed at
the ANR level. For practical applications such as rate coeﬃcient calculations, we still
recommend computing cross sections and rates for the excitation processes (including
the Heaviside correction) and using the detailed balance relation for the reverse ones.

4. Conclusions

Near-threshold rotational excitation of H+
3 by electron-impact has been investigated
by comparing ANR cross sections with calculations based on the MQDT rotational-
frame-transformation (MQDT-RFT) method (Kokoouline and Greene 2003). Very good
agreement between ANR and MQDT-RFT cross sections is obtained for kinetic energies
above the resonance regime caused by rotational closed-channels. These resonances
occur for transitions with ∆J = 1 and ∆K = 0 and for these, an analytical formula
for averaging transition probabilities over the resonance structure has been formulated.
This averaging procedure is shown to signiﬁcantly enhance probabilities and, to a lesser

shown to be accurate down to threshold, provided a simple ’Heaviside correction’ is
applied to the excitation cross sections. An alternative but strictly equivalent solution
is to interpret the ANR energy as the exit kinetic electron energy and to compute
deexcitation cross sections.

Some previous studies of the rotational excitation of molecular ions by electron
collision, such as the H+
3 study by Faure and Tennyson (2002b), applied the “correction”
factor k′/k, designed for neutral targets by Morrison (1988),
in a manner that is
not strictly correct. The resulting error in those results will be generally modest,
nevertheless, except at energies very close to rotational thresholds. Ideally, those results
should be revised along the lines implied by the more detailed analysis of the present
study, including the average eﬀects of closed channel resonances where appropriate. But
this is beyond the scope of the present article, so we do not present a comprehensive set of
revised excitation rate coeﬃcients here. Moreover, the scattering matrices obtained in R-
matrix calculations can be used even below closed-channel thresholds, provided they are

Near threshold rotational excitation of molecular ions by electron-impact

suﬃciently smooth functions of energy, and provided they are used in combination with
MQDT closed-channel elimination formulas. The excellent agreement between R-matrix
ANR cross sections and the MQDT-RFT results in Figs. 2 and 3 provides supporting
evidence for this point. This is also supported by the quantum defects as deduced from
the R-matrix calculations (using the diagonal BF T -matrix elements restricted to the
p-wave channels): we obtain µ0=0.05 and µ±1=0.37, in very good agreement with the
MQDT-RFT values of, respectively, 0.05 and 0.39 (see section 2.2.1).

The range of validity of the adiabatic theory is therefore much wider than the usual
classically derived condition that the impacting electron energy be large compared to
the threshold energy. Moreover, it should be stressed that H+
3 is quite an unfavorable
system for the ANR theory owing to its large rotational spacings that make threshold and
closed-channel eﬀects important up to large kinetic energies (> 0.01 eV). In particular,
for astrophysical applications where inelastic rate coeﬃcients are required down to
∼10−100 K (Faure et al 2006), Rydberg resonances will play a signiﬁcant role.
In
contrast, for ions with rotational spacings smaller than typically 10 K, resonances will
be of minor importance. Finally, in the case of strongly polar ions (µ &2 D) such
as HCO+, rotational excitation is completely dominated by (dipolar) transitions with
∆J = 1 (see, e.g. Faure and Tennyson (2001)). In this case, resonances due to the
low probability transitions ∆J > 1 should not contribute signiﬁcantly to the dipolar
cross sections. High-partial waves (l > 1) are, however, required to converge dipolar
cross sections (i.e., the use of BF T -matrix elements actually leads to a divergent cross
section). It will be thus important to investigate in future works the inﬂuence of closed-
channels on d-, f - and higher partial wave contributions to the cross section.

Abstract

We investigate the resonant motion of neutral spin- 1

2-fermions in a magnetic guide. A wealth of

unitary and anti-unitary symmetries is revealed in particular giving rise to a two-fold degeneracy

of the energy levels. To compute the energies and decay widths of a large number of resonances

the complex scaling method is employed. We discuss the dependence of the lifetimes on the

angular momentum of the resonance states. In this context the existence of so-called quasi-bound

states is shown. In order to approximately calculate the resonance energies of such states a radial

Schr¨odinger equation is derived which improves the well-known adiabatic approximation. The

eﬀects of an additionally applied homogeneous Ioﬀe ﬁeld on the resonance energies and decay

widths are also considered. The results are applied to the case of the 6Li atom in the F = 1
2

hyperﬁne ground state.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic traps are now being used for many years in order to study and manipulate

the properties of neutral atoms [1]. With the availability of eﬃcient cooling techniques the

controlled occupation of low lying quantum levels inside such traps became possible. This

paved the way for the experimental exploration of several phenomena such as Bose-Einstein-

condensation (see Ref. [2] and references therein) or the formation of degenerate Fermi gases

[3]. Apart from studying such collective properties there is also a fundamental and vivid

interest in the properties and the dynamics of single atoms. Its understanding is essential in

order to identify systems for quantum information processing but it is also necessary to gain

insights into trapping mechanisms in order to control the atomic motion. Theoretical studies

of the quantum properties of neutral atoms in magnetic traps have been performed since

the late eighties. Since then several ﬁeld conﬁgurations have been in the focus of numerous

publications, e.g. the quadrupole ﬁeld [4], the wire trap [5, 6, 7] or the magnetic guide and the

Ioﬀe trap [8, 9, 10]. However, only a few ﬁeld conﬁgurations allow for stationary solutions.

Bound states of spin- 1

2 -particles trapped by a wire have been found analytically by Bl¨umel
et al. [11] and Vestergaard Hau et al. [6]. The latter authors employed a super-symmetric

approach in order to derive the Rydberg series of bound states around an inﬁnitely thin wire.

Finite wire sizes were accounted for by introducing a quantum defect in the Rydberg formula.

Burke et al. [7] were able to numerically derive similar series of energies for particles with spin

up to 2 by using the ﬁnite element method combined with the application of multichannel

quantum defect theory. However, in most cases atoms are trapped in meta-stable states

which have a ﬁnite lifetime. The calculation of the corresponding resonance energies and

lifetimes requires the application of sophisticated numerical methods. Bergeman et al. [4]

have calculated dozens of resonances of spin- 1

2 -particles inside a three-dimensional magnetic
quadrupole ﬁeld by determining the phase-shift of scattered waves. A similar approach was

pursued by Hinds and Eberlein [8, 9] which have studied the dynamics of neutral particles

in a magnetic guide. Their results were reproduced by Potvliege and Zehnl´e who have

performed a complex scaling calculation. In both publications the eﬀect of an additionally

applied homogeneous Ioﬀe ﬁeld is also discussed but only a few resonances are studied.

Although there are no principle obstacles to compute resonances there has always been

put great eﬀort in ﬁnding reasonable approximations which allow for an quick and easy

2

calculation of the resonance energies. Here the most prominent example is the so-called

adiabatic approximation [4, 5] where the spin is aligned along the local direction of the

magnetic ﬁeld. Depending on their electronic state the atoms are here divided into low- and

high-ﬁeld seekers which give rise to bound and unbound solutions.

In this work we focus on the quantum dynamics of a neutral spin- 1

2 -particle in a magnetic
guide. We also address the case of an additional homogeneous ﬁeld being applied parallel to

the guide (Ioﬀe ﬁeld). Like Potvliege and Zehnl´e[10] we employ a complex scaling approach.

In contrast to their work we calculate hundreds of resonances for several values of the Ioﬀe

ﬁeld strength which enables us to analyze global features of the resonance spectrum.

In

order get further insights we develop an approximate description of so-called quasi-bound

states. We derive a radial Schr¨odinger equation which is superior to the common adiabatic

approach. In contrast to the latter our method becomes exact for high angular momenta

and its quality does not depend on whether there is an additional Ioﬀe ﬁeld or not.

This work is organized as follows: In Section II we derive the Hamiltonian for a neu-

tral particle possessing a magnetic moment ~µ in a magnetic guide. We also account for

an eventually applied homogeneous Ioﬀe ﬁeld parallel to the guide. The resulting two-

dimensional Hamiltonian depends on a single parameter involving both the gradient of the

inhomogeneous ﬁeld and the Ioﬀe ﬁeld strength. It exhibits a plethora of unitary as well as

anti-unitary symmetries. The eﬀects of this intricate symmetry properties and in particular

a resultant two-fold degeneracy of the resonance energies are discussed in Sec. III. In Sec.

IV we brieﬂy outline the numerical approach we pursue in order to obtain the resonance

energies and decay width which is based on the complex scaling method. Sec. V is devoted

to a discussion of our results. We analyze the resonance spectrum for several values of the

Ioﬀe ﬁeld strength. Furthermore we investigate how the energies and lifetimes of the reso-

nance states depend on their angular momentum. The properties of so-called quasi bound

states are addressed. We provide a radial Schr¨odinger equation whose eigenenergies are very

good approximations of the true resonance energies. A comparison to the commonly used

adiabatic approximation is also performed. Finally the results are applied to the case of 6Li

in a magnetic ﬁeld generated by a current carrying wire together with a homogeneous bias

ﬁeld.

II. THE HAMILTONIAN

We consider the motion of a neutral spin- 1

2 -particle which carries the magnetic moment

~µ inside a magnetic quadrupole guide. The magnetic ﬁeld is given by

~B (~r) = 

The parameters b and B determine the gradient and the ﬁeld strength of an eventually

applied homogeneous ﬁeld along the z-axis (Ioﬀe ﬁeld), respectively. Generally the Hamil-

tonian for a neutral particle with the magnetic moment ~µ and mass M in a magnetic ﬁeld

reads

Since there is in our case (2) no explicit dependence on the z-coordinate the momentum in

z-direction pz is conserved. Employing plane waves for the wavefunction in z-direction one

obtains a two-dimensional Hamiltonian which describes the dynamics in the x

y plane.

Adopting atomic units [17] and with ~µ =

spite of its simplicity the system (4) possesses a wealth of symmetry properties. The algebra

of the underlying symmetry group possesses a complicated structure some features of which

B. The case γ

= 0

For γ

= 0 the conserved quantity Λz persists but only 7 of the discrete symmetries for

γ = 0 remain. They are listed in table III. These operations form a non-Abelian algebra. In

contrast to the group operations listed in table I there are no two anti-commuting operators.

Hence it is not possible to construct pairs of degenerate energy eigenstates as discussed above.

The operation Pyσx which we have used to construct the degenerate pairs of states for γ = 0

now has the following property

Pyσx H (γ) Pyσx = H (

γ) ,

−

(11)

i.e. the sign of γ in the Hamiltonian (4) is changed. Hence, the application of Pyσx reverses

the sign of the homogeneous Ioﬀe ﬁeld. We emphasize that even for γ

= 0 the operators H,

Σz and Λz form a commuting set of operators.

IV. NUMERICAL TREATMENT

The Hamiltonian (4) does not support bound states [9]. In order to calculate the energies

and decay widths of the scattering wavefunctions we employ the complex scaling method

together with the linear variational principle.

(12)

Unlike the bound states only continuum states are aﬀected by the complex scaling procedure.

The scattering states are rotated into the lower half of the complex plane and in particular

resonances correspond now to square integrable functions. Since for θ

= 0 the complex

(cid:1)

scaled Hamiltonian (12) is not Hermitian one encounters complex energies:

ε = E

Γ

.

−

Here E is the energy and Γ the decay width of the resonance (the lifetime τ of a quantum

states is connected to its decay width by τ = Γ−1). In general the energy E will depend on

the value of the rotation angle θ. Continuum states are rotated by 2θ into the lower half

of the complex plane whereas energies of resonance states - once revealed - are independent

of the angle θ. A detailed discussion of the complex scaling procedure can be found in Ref.

[13] and Refs. therein. Since the complex scaling procedure transforms resonance states

into square integrable wavefunctions one can apply the linear variational principle in order

to compute the wavefunctions and resonance energies. We utilize an orthonormal basis set

of the form

Since [Λz, Σz] = 0 one could also demand the states to be a priori eigenfunctions of Λz as

well. However, our basis set is not particularly well suited to construct eigenfunctions to

Λz. We therefore abstain from putting this constraint on the above expansion. Neverthe-

less, the resulting diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix (see below) guarantees that

our numerically obtained energy and Σz-eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions to Λz. The

V. RESULTS

In this section we discuss the results obtained via the above-described complex scaling

approach. We present the resonance energy spectrum and study the dependence of the decay

widths on the eigenvalue of Λz. Additionally we discuss how the lifetimes are aﬀected if a

homogeneous Ioﬀe ﬁeld ist applied. Furthermore a radial Schr¨odinger equation is derived

that describes quasi-bound states in the magnetic guide. All results are given for b = M =

g
2 = 1. In order to obtain the resonance energies and decay widths for diﬀerent parameters
one has to multiply the latter by the factor 1

of how the results apply to the experimentally important case of a trapped 6Li atom in the

A. Energies and decay widths of resonance states

In ﬁgure 2 we present the energies and decay widths of the resonances of a spin- 1

2 -particle
in the magnetic guide. For γ = 0 one observes a regular pattern for the arrangement of the

complex energies, i.e. they are located along lines in the semi-logarithmic representation.

This implies that the decay width essentially decreases exponentially with increasing energy

along the mentioned lines. The decay width of the lowest (and here also broadest) resonance
is Γγ=0

min = 0.3738. Increasing γ results in a distortion of the regular pattern. One observes
the formation of vertical lines together with a regrouping of the resonances into pairs for

larger γ (see in particular ﬁgure 2 for γ = 4). Here states with large decay widths are

aﬀected more strongly than long lived states. Overall we encounter a decrease of the decay

width if γ increases. Thus as it is well-known an additional Ioﬀe ﬁeld has a stabilizing

eﬀect. For the decay widths of the lowest resonance state our calculation yields the series
Γγ=1
min = 0.0648, Γγ=2
suggest an exponential decrease of the decay widths if γ increases. This agrees with the

FIG. 2: Energies E and decay widths Γ (logarithmic scale) for resonances in a magnetic guide

for κ = 1. An increasing Ioﬀe ﬁeld strength leads to a global decrease of the decay widths and

therefore has a stabilizing eﬀect. At the same time the resonance pattern becomes distorted and a

regrouping of the resonances into pairs is observed.

In Sec. III we have pointed out the degeneracy of the κ = 1- and κ =

1-subspaces.

−

For γ

= 0 these degeneracies are expected to split up since the symmetry properties of the

system changes. Figure 3 shows the resonances for γ = 1. States belonging to the κ = 1 or

κ =

−

1 subspaces are indicated by a dot or cross, respectively. Each state is accompanied by

its degenerate partner for γ = 0. The respective energy splitting decreases with decreasing

decay width. In the following we will ﬁnd that a small decay width is associated to the Λz

eigenvalue property of a resonance state: States with a small value for Γ are localized far

away from the center of the guide. Here the quadrupole ﬁeld dominates the homogeneous

Ioﬀe ﬁeld and determines the appearence of the spectrum. Therefore these states become

less aﬀected by the Ioﬀe ﬁeld which results in a decrease of the energy splitting.

Let us compare our results to those given by Hinds and Eberlein in Ref. [9]. First of all

we remark that we have studied a signiﬁcant larger number of resonances. In table IV we

B. Dependence of the resonance energies on the eigenvalue of Λz

In this section we analyze how the energies and decay widths of the resonances are related

to the eigenvalues of the angular momentum operator Λz. Although Λz is a conserved

quantity we have employed a set of basis functions which do not respect this fact. Thus

we need to calculate the matrix element m =

the Hamiltonian (12) which requires a complex symmetric scalar product. For a detailed

discussion see Ref.

For ﬁnite Ioﬀe ﬁeld strength the pattern becomes asymmetric.

resonances. For γ = 0 one observes each state to possess a degenerate counterpart, i.e. a

state with opposite m. This results in the formation of a symmetric pyramid-like distribution

where the maximum Λz eigenvalue depends approximately linear on the resonance energy E.

With increasing γ the resonance energies in general are shifted towards larger values (this

can hardly be seen in ﬁgure 4 for γ = 1). Thereby, states with positive m acquire a larger

energetical shift than states with negative values of the quantum number m. Due to this

asymmetric energy shift the distribution becomes asymmetric (with respect to m

m),

too. Here energies of states having the same κ quantum number form continuous, nearly

horizontal, lines whereas we observe the resonance energies for γ = 0 to be arranged on
broken horizontal lines. In subsection V D we will show that in the limit of ρ2

Subsequent lines belong to states with opposite Σz quantum number. With increasing m

values the states become less aﬀected by the Ioﬀe ﬁeld. Their wavefunctions become located

farther away from the center of the guide. In this region the strength of the linearly increasing

quadrupole ﬁeld outweighs the eﬀects of the Ioﬀe ﬁeld.

FIG. 5: Decay widths and Λz eigenvalues of resonances for γ = 0 (left picture) and γ = 1 (right

picture). The decay width decreases exponentially with increasing modulus of m. With increasing

Ioﬀe ﬁeld strength one observes an overall decrease of the decay widths and a widening of the

distribution.

In ﬁgure 5 the dependence of the decay widths on the Λz eigenvalue is presented. Here

we encounter an exponential decrease of the decay widths with increasing modulus of m.

Overall the decay widths decrease if γ increases and at the same time the distribution

becomes broader.

C. Quasi-bound states for γ = 0

Although a spin in our ﬁeld conﬁguration does not possess bound states there exist

resonances with very long lifetimes, i.e. very small decay widths. The discussion of these

quasi-bound states is the subject of the present section.

Transforming the Hamiltonian (4) to polar coordinates (ρ, φ) and exploiting the conser-

the diagonal ones. With increasing m the discrepancy of E and Eqb decreases as suggested

by (24). The surprisingly good quality of the approximation can be explained by looking at

Table VI compares the resonance energies E obtained for γ = 5 to the eigenvalues Eqb

calculated by solving the scalar radial Schr¨odinger equation (34). Apart from m =

0.5

the agreement is excellent with discrepancies lower than 0.05 %. This is again the result of

a localization of the particle wavefunction away from center of the guide which is the only

region where the oﬀ-diagonal coupling terms are remarkable. However, for m =

0.5 and

γ = 5 the eﬀective potential of the Schr¨odinger equation (34) does not possess a centrifugal

barrier. Here the wavefunction has non-zero contributions in the vicinity of the center

−

−

of the guide. Hence the oﬀ-diagonal coupling terms of equation (31) become important.

Considering the fact that the equation (34) here becomes certainly invalid the energies E

and Eqb still agree surprisingly well (see table VI).

We now compare the results of the approximate Schr¨odinger equation (34) to those one

would obtain within the so called adiabatic approximation. In this picture one assumes the

to a temperature of 12.97µK. This temperature regime is certainly accessible by todays cold

atom experiments. Correspondingly the transition frequencies to excited states lie in the

MHz regime. The lifetime of the ground state evaluates to 2.04µs. Under consideration of

the exponential scaling with increasing angular momentum almost arbitrarily long lifetimes

can be achieved by preparing the atoms in high Λz eigenstate, e.g. the minimum lifetime

VI. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We have investigated the motion of a neutral spin- 1

2 -fermions in a magnetic quadrupole
guide. The impact of an additionally applied homogeneous Ioﬀe ﬁeld is also studied. Intro-

ducing a canonical scaling transformation of the phase space coordinates we have derived

22

an eﬀective two-dimensional Hamiltonian depending on a single parameter γ. The energies

and decay widths of resonance states of the Schr¨odinger equation have been calculated by

employing the complex scaling method. Utilizing a 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator basis

we were able to converge hundreds of resonance states.

The analysis of the underlying Hamiltonian revealed a large number of symmetries. In

the absence of a homogeneous Ioﬀe ﬁeld we have found 15 discrete symmetries of both
unitary and anti-unitary character in addition to the conserved quantity Λz = Lz −
deeper investigation of the underlying symmetry group revealed a two-fold degeneracy of

Sz. A

any energy level. If a Ioﬀe ﬁeld is applied Λz is still conserved but only 7 discrete symmetries

remain. Due to the altered symmetry group the degeneracies are lifted.

We have calculated the resonance energies for several values of the parameter γ. A

comparison to the values obtained by Hinds and Eberlein (Ref. [9]) has been performed. For

γ = 0 (vanishing Ioﬀe ﬁeld) the resonance energies and decay widths form a regular pattern

in the E

Γ plane. Increasing the Ioﬀe ﬁeld leads to a distorted distribution and the decay

−

widths are pushed towards larger values. Thus the stability of the resonance states increases

with the Ioﬀe ﬁeld strength. An analysis of the lowest resonance has shown an exponential

increase of lifetimes which agrees with results obtained by others [15]. Furthermore we

could show an exponentially increasing lifetime with increasing modulus of the m quantum

number. Apparently, with increasing

the wavefunctions become localized farther from

the center of the guide where transitions to continuum states are induced.

We could show the existence of so called quasi-bound states which can be described by

a scalar radial Schr¨odinger equation. The approximate eigenenergies agree very well with

the resonance energies obtained from the complex scaling calculation and become exact in

the limit of high m quantum numbers. But even for low angular momenta an astonishing

agreement could be observed. For γ = 0 (without Ioﬀe ﬁeld) this is due to the fact that

m is half-integer valued which leads to a non-vanishing angular momentum barrier. This

prevents the particle from entering the center of the guide. However, the coupling matrix

element to the unbound states does only assume signiﬁcant values for ρ

0 i.e.

the

→

corresponding transitions are strongly inhibited. For γ = 0 we have also calculated an

analytic expression for the ground state energy in each m subspace. For γ

= 0 the quasi-

bound energies are compared to those obtained from the so-called adiabatic approximations.

We have shown that our approach is in general more accurate and reproduces in particular

underlying degeneracies.

The results have been applied to the case of 6Li in the F = 1

2 state. Here we have con-
sidered a magnetic guide generated by a current carrying wire together with a homogeneous

bias ﬁeld. We have shown that for typical experimental parameter values the ground state

energy corresponds to a temperature of a few micro-Kelvin. The lifetime of the resonance

states can be extended up to minutes if the atoms are prepared in a suﬃcient high angular

momentum state.

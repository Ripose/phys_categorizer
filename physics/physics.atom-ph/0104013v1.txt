On the nature of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates in rubidium

(Dated: February 2, 2008)
We perform detailed close-coupling calculations for the rubidium isotopes 85Rb and 87Rb to
ascertain the nature of their spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. These calculations predict that the
spinor condensate for the spin-1 boson 87Rb has a ferromagnetic nature. The spinor condensates for
the spin-2 bosons 85Rb and 87Rb, however, are both predicted to be polar. The nature of a spin-1
condensate hinges critically on the sign of the diﬀerence between the s-wave scattering lengths for
total spin 0 and 2 while the nature of a spin-2 condensate depends on the values of the diﬀerences
between s-wave scattering lengths for the total spin 0, 2 and 4. These scattering lengths were
extracted previously and found to have overlapping uncertainties for all three cases, thus leaving
the nature of the spinor condensates ambiguous. The present study exploits a reﬁned uncertainty
analysis of the scattering lengths based on recently improved result from experimental work by
Roberts et al., which permits us to extract an unambiguous result for the nature of the ground state
spinor condensates.

In a conventional magnetic trap for ultra-cold alkali
atoms the spin degrees of freedom are “frozen out” since
the atom must be in a weak-ﬁeld seeking Zeeman state to
be trapped. In an optical trap, however, the spins of the
alkali atoms are essentially free, and all magnetic sub-
states |f, mi for a given spin f can be populated. Since
the atom-atom interaction depends on spin, these mag-
netic substates can be changed in a scattering event. Ac-
cordingly, it is of interest to see how the spins are orga-
nized in the ground state and to explore the nature of
the spin-mixing dynamics in an optically trapped Bose-
Einstein condensate.

Multi-component condensates have been formed in
magnetic traps. For instance Ref.
[1] used a dou-
ble magneto-optical trap and a magnetic trap to cre-
ate condensates in either the |f = 2, m = 2i or the
|f = 1, m = −1i spin state of 87Rb, and in a mixture
of both by cooling |1, −1i evaporatively and |2, 2i via
thermal contact with the |1, −1i atoms. In this case the
spin projections are approximately frozen out because
the spin-ﬂip cross sections in 87Rb are anomalously small
[2, 3, 4]. By contrast, Ref. [5] made a sodium condensate
consisting simultaneously of all three magnetic substates
of the f = 1 atomic state, by cooling the atoms in a
magnetic trap and then transferring them into a optical
trap. This experimental technique produces what is re-
ferred to as a spinor condensate, because it can explore
its full range of spin degrees of freedom.
In the theo-
retical description of Ref. [6, 7], the spinor condensates
are classiﬁed according to the relative values of certain
characteristic scattering lengths. Note that alternative
theoretical treatments [8, 9] diﬀer in their detailed pre-
dictions concerning the nature of the spinor BEC ground
state. Nevertheless, in this paper we determine the in-
teraction parameters for spinor condensates of 85Rb and
87Rb which based on Ref.
[6, 7, 10] fall into the two
following categories:

Spin-1 atoms (87Rb) Let F be the total spin of two

bosonic spin f = 1 atoms, and let aF be the s-wave
scattering length for the total spin F symmetry. Since
f = 1, only F = 0, 2 are allowed by Bose symmetry
for an s-wave collision. The nature of the spin-1 BEC
ground state depends critically on the relative values of
a0 and a2. According to Ho [6] a spinor Bose conden-
sate composed of spin-1 bosons in an optical trap can
be either “ferromagnetic” or “antiferromagnetic” in na-
ture [6, 7]. The antiferromagnetic state has alternatively
been termed “polar”, and we use this terminology here.
The diﬀerence between the scattering lengths a0 and a2
determines the nature of the spin-1 condensate: the ferro-
magnetic state emerges when a0 > a2, whereas the polar
state emerges when a0 < a2 [6].
In the ferromagnetic
state virtually all atoms reside in the same spin substate
(either m = 1 or m = −1); in the polar state the spin
projections are mixed.

Spin-2 atoms (85Rb, 87Rb) Two bosonic spin f = 2
atoms possess F = 0, 2, 4 total spin states exhibiting
the appropriate Bose symmetry for an s-wave collision.
For spin-2 87Rb the scattering lengths a0, a2 and a4 are
determined by the real part of the phase-shift since the
inelastic scattering processes are also allowed. According
to Ciobanu et al.
[10], a spinor condensate of spin-2
bosons in an optical trap can be one of the three types
“ferromagnetic”, “polar”, or “cyclic” in nature, which
we abbreviate as F, P or C respectively. Ferromagnetic
and polar condensates are similar to those above. The
name “cyclic” arises from a close analogy with d -wave
BCS superﬂuids. The nature of the spin-2 BEC ground
state depends critically on the relative values of a0 − a2
and a2 − a4 [10].

5 | a0 − a4 |,
7 (a2 − a4) > 0,
7 (a2 − a4) > 0.

P: a0 − a4 < 0, 2
F: a2 − a4 > 0, 1
C: a2 − a4 < 0, 1

The three states emerge under following conditions:
7 | a2 − a4 |< 1
5 | a0 − a4 | + 2
5 | a0 − a4 | − 2
For spin-1 87Rb the total spin F = 0 and F = 2 scat-
tering lengths a0 and a2 are almost equal. They have
been calculated before [6] based on the analysis of Ref.
[11], but the uncertainties determined still overlap for a0
and a2, so that the sign of the diﬀerence has remained
uncertain. In particular, the scattering lengths have been
[11]. For spin-
interpreted rather conservatively in Ref.
2 85Rb and 87Rb the uncertainties for the total spin F
scattering lengths a0, a2 and a4 have been too large to
uniquely identify the nature of the spinor condensates
[7]. The uncertainty region for 85Rb was large enough to
overlap all three regions P, F and C, while the uncertainty
region for 87Rb overlapped both the polar and the cyclic
region. In the present study we determine the scatter-
ing lengths a0 and a2, and their uncertainties for spin-1
87Rb, and a0, a2 and a4 and their uncertainties for spin-2
85Rb and 87Rb. We concentrate on an accurate determi-
nation of the diﬀerence a0 − a2 for spin-1 87Rb and the
pair (a0 − a4, a2 − a4) for spin-2 85Rb and 87Rb. If one
[8, 9]
accepts the spinor condensate treatment of Ref.
this analysis gives an unambiguous determination of the
nature of the BEC ground states.

Uncertainties in the scattering lengths arise primarily
from imperfect knowledge of three parameters: the long-
range van der Waals coeﬃcient C6, and the singlet and
the triplet s-wave scattering lengths, as and at respec-
tively.
In addition, when using potential curves deter-
mined for one isotope to predict scattering for another
isotope, the results can depend on the precise number of
bound states in the triplet potential, Nb as well as the
precise number of bound states in the singlet potential.
Roberts et al. analyzed a magnetic-ﬁeld Feshbach reso-
nance to determine “state of the art” potentials for 85Rb
[11]. Recently they have revisited some of the rether-
malization measurements in Ref. [11] and improved the
uncertainties for the long-range van der Waals coeﬃcient
and the singlet end triplet s-wave scattering lengths for
85Rb [12].

Using these new values of C6, as and at we show below
unambiguously that a0 > a2 for spin-1 87Rb. This result
in turn implies that the spinor condensate is deﬁnitely
ferromagnetic, as was previously suspected [6]. By con-
trast the spin-1 23Na scattering lengths, recently deter-
mined in Ref. [13], imply that a 23Na f = 1 spinor BEC
is polar, as has been suggested before [6]. By extracting
the scattering length from a spectroscopic experiment,
Crubellier et al. found that, for 23Na, a0 = 50.0±1.6 a.u.
and a2 = 55.0 ± 1.7 a.u. [13]. They calculated the scat-
tering lengths for two values of the C6 coeﬃcient for 23Na
and found that the inﬂuence of the C6 value is very small
(a 4% change in C6 results in a variation in the scattering
length of the order of 0.1%). Consequently, the analysis
for 23Na [13], in conjunction with the present analysis for
87Rb, implies that both types of spin-1 condensates can

2

be realized with the atoms used most frequently in BEC
experiments (23Na and 87Rb).

7 | a2 − a4 |< 1

The improved results for C6, as and at also predict that
a0 − a4 < 0, 2
5 | a0 − a4 |, for both spin-2
85Rb and 87Rb. This result implies that both spin-2 85Rb
and 87Rb will be polar. Previously, it was estimated that
87Rb would be polar, but that 87Rb would be cyclic [10].
This implies that the ground state for spin-2 85Rb and
87Rb will have the same nature as spin-2 23Na. Spin-2
23Na was already unambiguously classiﬁed since the un-
certainties on diﬀerences between the relevant scattering
lengths place a0 − a4 and a2 − a4 within the polar region
[10]. The results for spin-1 87Rb and for spin-2 85Rb and
87Rb are summarized in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

Our calculations start from the singlet and triplet
Born-Oppenheimer potentials between two rubidium
atoms that were calculated in Ref. [14], where the sing-
let potential is adjusted to have 125 bound states [15].
These potentials are matched smoothly at r = 22.0 a.u.
to the standard long-range van der Waals potentials us-
ing the new value of the long-range coeﬃcient C6 in-
ferred from the experiment in Ref.
[11] and reanalyzed
according to Ref. [12], and using the C8 and C10 coeﬃ-
cients from the calculations of Ref. [16]. The potentials
are adjusted to match the scattering length by includ-
ing short-range inner-wall corrections that are parame-
terized for each spin by: c arctan((r − rmin)2/(cr)) for
r < rmin. cr is a constant (the same order of magnitude
as rmin; slightly diﬀerent for the singlet and the triplet),
the inner-wall parameters c are of the order of 10−5 to
10−4 a.u., r is the separation between the two Rb atoms
and rmin is the separation for which the potential is min-
imal. The inner-wall parameters c are varied over a range
that reproduces the recently improved values of as and
at. The improved values of C6 for rubidium, as and at
for 85Rb are: C6 = 4660 ± 20 a.u., as = 3650+1500
−670 a.u.
and at = −332 ± 18 a.u. [12], while the calculations of
[16] determined that ¯C8 = 550600 a.u.. These are
Ref.
the values we adopt in the present calculations. Our cal-
culations here do not allow for variance in C8. This is
reasonable because the dependence of C8 is one order of
magnitude smaller than the dependence of C6. Further-
more the number of bound states in the triplet potential
was previously believed to be 39 ± 1 [15, 17], but more
reﬁned experimental analysis suggests that it is instead
40 ≤ Nb ≤ 42 [15, 18]. The present calculations are done
for Nb = 39, 40, 41, 42. The number of bound states in
the singlet potential is not changed.

Our calculations have been carried out for three values
of C6 that span the empirical range (4640 − 4680 a.u.).
These values are adequate since the quantities of interest
vary smoothly with C6 over the range of interest. We
also tested the triplet potential for each one of the four
relevant Nb (39, 40, 41, 42). For each value of Nb we
determine the values of the inner-wall corrections that
correspond to the uncertainty range of 85Rb as and at
for each of the three values of C6. These calculations are
carried out at zero magnetic ﬁeld and 130 nK since the

FIG. 1: Total spin F = 0 scattering length versus total spin
F = 2 scattering length for spin-1 87Rb. The uncertainties
of a0 and a2 are determined by the uncertainties on as, at,
C6 and Nb, the number of bound states in the 85Rb triplet
potential. The symbols in the middle of the “diamonds” are
the mean scattering length for each C6 and the diamonds
encircle the uncertainties arising from uncertainties on as and
at for all C6. The thick black line shows the boundary between
the ferromagnetic and polar phase of the spinor condensate:
a0 = a2 and the number next to each diamond is Nb.

given value of C6, as and at are determined from colli-
sions at this temperature [12]. The same potentials opti-
mized for 85Rb have been used in our 87Rb calculations,
except for an appropriate change in the reduced mass.
Since Nb in rubidium is unknown at present, and since
we utilize the same potentials determined by the 85Rb
singlet and triplet scattering length in our 87Rb calcula-
tions, we incorporate Nb in our analysis of the uncertain-
ties for 87Rb. The singlet and triplet potentials are used
in multichannel calculations to compute the a0 and a2 for
spin-1 87Rb and a0, a2 and a4 for spin-2 85Rb and 87Rb
(again at zero magnetic ﬁeld and at 130 nK), with ﬁxed
C6 and Nb. The calculations are then repeated for each
value of C6 and Nb with the corresponding new values of
the inner-wall corrections. These calculations span the
empirical C6, Nb, as and at range, which permits us to
extract the over-all uncertainty in the diﬀerence between
the relevant scattering lengths, a0 − a2 for spin-1 and the
two relevant diﬀerences (a0 − a4, a2 − a4) for spin-2.

As a conﬁrmation, the same rubidium potentials have
also been used to calculate the singlet and triplet s-wave
scattering lengths as and at for 87Rb (at 130 nK energy).
These single-channel calculations have been repeated for
the three values of C6 and four values of C6 that span
the empirical range. This permits us to check whether as
and at fall within the range of previous measured values.
The single-channel triplet scattering lengths are found to

tering lengths versus the diﬀerence between total spin F = 0
and F = 4 scattering lengths for spin-2 87Rb. The uncertain-
ties of a0, a2 and a4 are determined by the uncertainties of as,
at, C6 and Nb, the number of bound states in the 85Rb triplet
potential. The symbols in the middle of the “diamonds” are
the mean scattering length for each C6 and the diamonds en-
circle the uncertainties arising from uncertainties on as and

tween the polar and the cyclic phase of the spinor condensate:

and the single-channel singlet scattering length is found
to be: as = 91 ± 1 a.u.. The as and at values for Nb = 39
are in good agreement with previous work [11, 19]. As
another conﬁrmation, and since Nb is unknown we have
also calculated the 85Rb scattering length for f = 2, m =
−2 at various magnetic ﬁelds to compare the obtained
values with the values from Roberts et al.; [12]. This
comparison shows good agreement. For each of the Nb,
the scattering lengths obtained for the speciﬁc magnetic
ﬁelds exhibits an uncertainty greater than the one given
by [13].

The values for a0 and a2 for spin-1 87Rb,along with
their uncertainties, are shown in Fig. 1. a0 is always
greater than a2 in the multichannel calculations, which
unambiguously determine the nature of spin-1 87Rb to
be ferromagnetic. The global diﬀerence lies between 0.3
and 2.7 a.u. over the uncertainty range. The diﬀerence is
an increasing function of Nb, while a0 and a2 themselves
are decreasing functions of Nb. For a given Nb, the range
of possible values of a0 and a2 varies only weakly with

FIG. 3: Diﬀerence between total spin F = 2 and F = 4 scat-
tering lengths versus the diﬀerence between total spin F = 0
and F = 4 scattering lengths for spin-2 85Rb. The uncertain-
ties of a0, a2 and a4 are determined by the uncertainties of as,
at, C6 and Nb, the number of bound states in the 85Rb triplet
potential. The symbols in the middle of the “diamonds” are
the mean scattering length for Nb = 41 and each C6 and the
diamonds encircle the uncertainties arising from uncertain-
ties on as and at for each C6. The thick black line shows
the boundary between the polar and the cyclic phase of the
spinor condensate: (a2 − a4) = −7
10 (a2 − a4) and the close-up
shows the average values for the four diﬀerent Nb.

C6, as was the case for 23Na [13].

The results of a0 −a4 and a2 −a4 with uncertainties for
87Rb spin-2 are shown in Fig. 2. For all four values of Nb
and all three values of C6 the uncertainty region is within
the “polar” region, making the nature of 87Rb spin-2
condensate unambiguously determined. The pair (a0 −
a4, a2 − a4) moves closer to the boundary between the
polar and the cyclic regions as Nb is increased but never
reaches the boundary, within the present uncertainties.
For a ﬁxed value of Nb a2 − a4 is increasing as a function
of C6, while a0 − a4 is almost independent of C6. The
uncertainty region for a ﬁxed value of Nb is very narrow
(especially for higher Nb). The long axis of this region
corresponds to the diﬀerence as − at, whereas the narrow
axis corresponds to the sum as + at.

The results for 85Rb spin-2 are shown on Fig. 3. In
contrast to the case of 87Rb, here a2 − a4 and a0 − a4 are
more dependent on the value of C6 than on Nb, but only
very little. a2 − a4 and a0 − a4 are slowly increasing func-
tions of C6 as well as of Nb. The uncertainties for all Nb
and values of C6 unambiguously determine the nature of
85Rb spin-2 to be polar. The uncertainty region is again
very narrow. The long axis of this region corresponds to
at, whereas the narrow axis corresponds to as.

Since the graphs for spin-2 85Rb and 87Rb show

4

only scattering lengths diﬀerences rather than scatter-
ing lengths, we summarize a0, a2 and a4 in the following
table. The scattering lengths for 85Rb show only very
little dependence of Nb. Over the entire range of as, at,
C6 and Nb the estimated scattering lengths for 85Rb are
(in a.u.):

a0 = −680 ± 80, a2 = −540 ± 50, a4 = −390 ± 30
The scattering lengths for spin-2 87Rb over the entire
range of as, at and C6 are estimated as (in a.u.):

a4

a2

a0

Nb
39 90.5 ± 1 97.5 ± 1 106.8 ± 1
40 89.0 ± 1 94.8 ± 1 103.6 ± 1
41 87.7 ± 1 92.4 ± 1 100.5 ± 1
42 86.4 ± 1 90.2 ± 1 97.4 ± 1

These numbers conservatively give the global uncertain-
ties for each Nb. In the context of spinor condensates it
is necessary to consider the actual allowed regions of the
parameters, as we have done above and which permit us
to draw meaningful conclusions.

To see how the results change when the multichan-
nel and single-channel energy changes, we calculated the
scattering lengths at various energies (with 1 pico Kelvin
in the single and multichannel as the lowest value) to
cover the relevant temperature for some experiments.
This did not change our conclusions about the nature
of the spinor Bose-Einstein condensates in rubidium.

Since the shape of the inner-wall potential is not known
exactly and since we change it to have potentials with the
four diﬀerent values of Nb we also performed the calcula-
tions with a quadratic inner-wall correction (c(r − rmin)2
for r < rmin) instead of the arctan form. This did not
change the conclusions and only changed the calculated
scattering lengths by about 0.1 %.

The present values of a0, a2 for spin-1 87Rb and a0,
a2, a4 for spin-2 85Rb and 87Rb are consistent with val-
ues obtained from Ref. [11]. Note that to carry out the
[11], the correlations among
calculations based on Ref.
as, at and C6 must be taken into account. We have sep-
arately calculated the values of a0, a2 for spin-1 87Rb
and a0, a2, a4 for spin-2 85Rb and 87Rb form as, at for
85Rb and C6 as given in Ref.
[11], and ﬁnd that they
support our classiﬁcations of the spinor condensates as
presented in this paper. The new values from Ref.
[12]
allow us to determine a smaller uncertainty on the cal-
culated scattering lengths, but they do not change our
conclusions.

In summary our analysis based on the new results for
the values of C6, as, at and the number of bound states
in the triplet potential demonstrate that the nature of
the ground states of 85Rb and 87Rb spin-2 condensates
should be polar.
In addition, the ground state of the
87Rb spin-1 condensate should be ferromagnetic. There-
fore, in view of the known scattering parameters for 23Na,
both ferromagnetic and polar spin-1 condensates are ex-
perimental accessible whereas no cyclic or ferromagnetic
spin-2 condensate appears to exist for the most common
rubidium isotopes.

Abstract

The one-loop self-energy correction to the hyperﬁne structure split-
ting of the 1s and 2s states of hydrogenlike ions is calculated both
for the point and ﬁnite nucleus. The results of the calculation are
combined with other corrections to ﬁnd the ground state hyperﬁne
splitting in lithiumlike 209Bi80+ and 165Ho64+.

The recent experimental investigation of the ground-state hyperﬁne split-
ting of 209Bi82+ [1] and 165Ho66+ [2] shows that the present experimental
accuracy is much higher than the accuracy of the corresponding theoretical
values. At present, measurements of the ground state hyperﬁne splitting of
lithium-like ions are designed. In this connection a necessity of an accurate
calculation of the QED corrections to the hyperﬁne splitting of the 1s and
2s states of highly charged ions is obvious.

The one-loop self-energy correction to the ﬁrst-order hyperﬁne interaction
for the ground state of hydrogenlike ions in the case of an extended nucleus
was calculated in [3] in a wide interval Z.
In the case of Z = 83 and a
In the present work we
point nucleus such a calculation was done in [4].
recalculate the self-energy correction for the 1s state and present results for
the 2s state. The calculation was made using the full-covariant scheme based
on an expansion of the Dirac-Coulomb propagator in terms of interactions
with the external potential [5, 6].

The self energy contribution to the hyperﬁne splitting is deﬁned by the
diagrams shown in Fig.1 where the dotted line denotes the hyperﬁne inter-
action. The formal expressions for these diagrams can easily be derived by
the two-time Green function method [7]. The diagrams in Fig.1a are con-
veniently divided into irreducible and reducible parts. The reducible part is

1

the part in which the intermediate-state energy (between the self energy and
the hyperﬁne interaction line) coincides with the initial-state energy. The ir-
reducible part is the remaining one. The irreducible part is calculated in the
same way as the ﬁrst order self-energy contribution. For a point nucleus the
external wave function containing the hyperﬁne interaction line is calculated
analytically by using the generalized virial relations for the Dirac-Coulomb
problem [8]. For an extended nucleus a calculation of the external wave
function was performed using the reduced Green function.

The reducible part is grouped with the vertex part presented in Fig.1b.
According to the Ward identity the counterterms for the vertex and the
reducible parts cancel each other and, so, the sum of these terms regularized
in the same covariant way is ultraviolet ﬁnite. To cancel the ultraviolet
divergences we separate free propagators from the bound electron lines and
calculate them in the momentum representation. The remainder is ultraviolet
ﬁnite but contains infrared divergences, which are explicitly separated and
cancelled.

The calculations were carried out for both point and extended nucleus.
In the last case the model of an uniformly charged shell with the radius
R = √15
4 hr2i1/2 was used for the nuclear charge distribution. With high
precision, this model is equivalent to the model of an uniformly charged
3hr2i1/2 if the ﬁrst-order hyperﬁne structure
sphere with the radius R = q
splitting is calculated. Our test calculation shows a good agreement between
these models for the self-energy correction to the hyperﬁne splitting too. The
Green function expressed in terms of the Whittaker and Bessel functions [9]
was used in the numerical calculation in the case of an extended nucleus. A
part of the vertex term was calculated using the B-spline basis set method
for the Dirac equation [10].

The results of the calculation for the 1s state are listed in the table 1.
The values of the root-mean-square nuclear charge radii given in the second
column of the table are taken from [12]. The values X listed in the table are
deﬁned by the equation

∆ESE = αX∆Enr ,

(1)

where ∆ESE is the self-energy correction to the hyperﬁne splitting, ∆Enr is
the non-relativistic value of the hyperﬁne splitting (Fermi energy), α is the
ﬁne structure constant. The results of the calculation for a point nucleus are

2

listed in the third column of the table. The ﬁnite nuclear size contributions
and the total self-energy corrections are given in the forth and ﬁfth columns,
respectively. In the last column the values F deﬁned by the equation

∆ESE =

F ∆Erel

α
π

(2)

are given. Here ∆Erel is the relativistic value of the ﬁrst-order hyperﬁne
splitting including the ﬁnite nuclear size correction. The value F is more
stable than X as respects to a variation of the nuclear parameters. In the
table 2 the corresponding values for the 2s state of hydrogenlike ions are
listed. The relative precision of the results is estimated to be not worse than
5 ∗ 10−

3.

As is mentioned above, the self-energy correction was calculated for the
1s state earlier in [3, 4]. In [4] for Z = 83 and a point nucleus it was found
X = −3.8, while the present calculation gives X = −3.94. This discrepancy
results from a noncovariant regularization procedure using in [4], which, as
it turned out, gives a small additional spurious term [11]. A comparison
of the present results for an extended nucleus with the previous calculation
of [3] reveals some discrepancy too. So, for Z = 83 in [3] it was obtained
F = 5.098, while the present calculation gives F = 5.141 (a diﬀerence due
to a discrepancy between the nuclear parameters is negligible). A detailed
comparison of our calculation with one from [6] shows that this discrepancy
results from a term in the vertex contribution omitted in [6].

Taking into account the present results for the self-energy correction and
values of the other corrections (nuclear magnetization distribution, interelec-
tronic interaction, and vacuum polarization) calculated in [13], we ﬁnd that
the wavelength of the hyperﬁne splitting transition for the 2s state in lithi-
umlike 209Bi80+ and 165Ho64+ is λ = 1.548(9) µm (µ = 4.1106(2)µN [14]) and
λ = 4.059(13) µm (µ = 4.132(5)µN [15], [2]), respectively. The uncertainty
of these values is mainly given by the nuclear magnetization distribution
correction.

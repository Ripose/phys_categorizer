In a recent letter [Auzinsh et. al. (physics/0403097)] we have analyzed the noise properties of
an idealized atomic magnetometer that utilizes spin squeezing induced by a continuous quantum
nondemolition measurement. Such a magnetometer measures spin precession of N atomic spins
by detecting optical rotation of far-detuned probe light. Here we consider maximally squeezed
probe light, and carry out a detailed derivation of the contribution to the noise in a magnetometric
measurement due to the diﬀerential AC Stark shift between Zeeman sublevels arising from quantum
ﬂuctuations of the probe polarization.

In this companion note to Ref. [1], we explicitly per-
form a calculation of the eﬀect of quantum ﬂuctuations of
the probe light polarization on the atomic spins. (All ref-
erences to equations not preceded by “A” refer to equa-
tions from Ref. [1].)

For nominally y-polarized light there is a small, ran-
dom admixture of circular polarization caused by vacuum
ﬂuctuations in the orthogonal polarization. Such random
circular polarization causes a diﬀerential AC Stark shift
between the Zeeman sublevels. Consequently, atoms ini-
tially polarized along x will precess in the xy-plane by an
angle αxy.

As discussed in Ref. [1] [Eq. (19)], the quantum ﬂuc-
tuations of the probe light polarization can be described
using the ellipticity operator introduced in Ref. [2]:

ˆǫ = E0

The diﬀerential Stark shift causes the atomic polarization
vector to precess by a random angle in the xy-plane, and
after time τ it has rotated by

αxy = τ δ∆ac .

Thus we have, by substituting Eq. (A.10) into Eq. (A.11)

What if squeezed probe light is used? In order to gain
an advantage in polarimetric sensitivity, one must employ
a local oscillator and heterodyne detection. Then the
noise level is diﬀerent depending on the phase of the local
oscillator, and can in fact be less than shot noise. For
example, if the squeezing technique discussed in Ref. [2]
is employed, the annihilation operator for squeezed light
(ˆas

where Eq. (A.15) can be derived in the same manner
that Eq. (A.9) was obtained by employing the expression
(A.14) for the annihilation operator (as is done explicitly
in Ref. [2]).

Assuming there is no absorption in the squeezing
medium (which would degrade the amount of squeezing),
for maximally squeezed light with the phase of the lo-
cal oscillator χ chosen to produce minimum noise (see
Ref. [2]), we ﬁnd that the noise in a polarimetric mea-
surement of the optical rotation angle ϕ is

(A.16)

In order to satisfy the Heisenberg limit this requires that

g2ℓ2 = Nph .

(A.17)

However, atoms interact with all possible phases of
the squeezed light, and thus the relevant ellipticity ﬂuc-
tuations for calculating the AC Stark shift eﬀects for
squeezed light are obtained by averaging over all phases:

We report precise measurements of ground-state, λ-doublet microwave transitions in the hydroxyl
radical molecule (OH). Utilizing slow, cold molecules produced by a Stark decelerator we have
improved over the precision of the previous best measurement by twenty-ﬁve-fold for the F’ = 2
→ F = 2 transition, yielding (1 667 358 996 ± 4) Hz, and by ten-fold for the F’ = 1 → F = 1
transition, yielding (1 665 401 803 ± 12) Hz. Comparing these laboratory frequencies to those from
OH megamasers in interstellar space will allow a sensitivity of 1 ppm for ∆α/α over ∼1010 years.

Current theories that attempt to unify gravity with
the other fundamental forces predict spatial and tempo-
ral variations in the fundamental constants, including the
ﬁne structure constant, α [1]. Measurements of the varia-
tion of α by observation of multiple absorption lines from
distant quasars are currently not in agreement [2, 3]. Due
to the use of spatially diverse absorbers, these measure-
ments are sensitive to relative Doppler shifts. Therefore
an independent conﬁrmation of the variation of α is im-
portant. Recently, there has been much interest in us-
ing OH megamasers in interstellar space to constrain the
evolution of fundamental constants [4, 5, 6] with several
important advantages. Speciﬁcally, it has been shown
that the sum and diﬀerence of the ∆F = 0 (F is total
angular momentum) transition frequencies in the ground
λ-doublet of OH depend on α as α0.4 and α4, respectively
[4]. Thus, by comparing the values measured from OH
megamasers to laboratory values it is possible to con-
strain α over cosmological time. Most importantly, the
multiple lines (that have diﬀerent dependence on α) aris-
ing from a single localized source diﬀerentiate the rela-
tive Doppler shift from the ∆α/α measurement. Further-
more, because of the unique properties of the λ-doublet,
the ∆F = 0 transitions are extremely insensitive to mag-
netic ﬁelds. However, as pointed out by Darling [4], for
the current limits on ∆α/α the change in the relevant
measurable quantities is on the order of 100 Hz, which
prior to this work was the accuracy of the best laboratory
based measurement. Thus, Darling called on the commu-
nity to produce a more precise measurement of the OH
λ-doublet microwave transitions to allow for tighter con-
straints on ∆α/α.

Despite the prominence of the OH radical in molecular
physics, the previous best measurement of the OH ground
λ-doublet, performed by ter Meulen and Dymanus [7],
has stood for over 30 years. This lack of improvement was
due to the relatively slow progress in the center-of-mass
motion control of molecules, which limited the maximum
ﬁeld interrogation time, and thus the spectroscopic reso-
lution. The ability of a Stark decelerator [8, 9] to provide

slow, cold pulses of molecules makes it an ideal source
for molecular spectroscopy [10].
In this work, a Stark
decelerator is used along with standard microwave spec-
troscopy techniques to perform the best measurement to
date of the ∆F = 0, λ-doublet microwave transitions in
OH, which along with appropriate astrophysical measure-
ments can be used to constrain ∆α/α with a sensitivity
of 1 ppm over the last ∼1010 years.

In its ro-vibronic ground state OH is a Hund’s case
(a) molecule with a 2Π conﬁguration and total molecule-
ﬁxed angular momentum of Ω = 3
2 . For the most
abundant isotopomer (O16H) the oxygen has no nuclear

spin and the hydrogen carries a nuclear spin of 1
2 lead-
ing to two total spin states with F = 1 and 2. Be-
cause the unpaired electron in OH has one unit of or-
bital angular momentum, these ro-vibronic ground states
are ‘λ-doubled’, leading to the closely spaced opposite
parity λ-doublet states shown in Fig. 1(a) labeled as
|F, mF , parityi. Though molecules are decelerated only
in the |2, ±2, +i and |2, ±1, +i states, the ﬁeld-free re-
gion from the hexapole to the microwave cavity leads to
an equal redistribution of the population among the ﬁve
magnetic sub-levels of the F = 2 upper doublet state. In
this work, both ∆F = 0 electric dipole transitions be-
tween the upper and lower doublet states are studied.
Though these transitions exhibit large Stark shifts (as is
necessary for Stark deceleration), they show remarkably
small Zeeman shifts. In fact, because the magnetic dipole
operator respects parity, one expects the ∆F = 0 transi-
tions of a pure case (a) molecule to show no magnetic ﬁeld
dependence. Nonetheless, because the hyperﬁne split-
ting diﬀers in the upper and lower doublet, and part of
the |mF | = 1 magnetic dipole moment comes from mix-
ing with the other hyperﬁne component, there is a small
quadratic shift of the |2, ±1, +i → |2, ±1, −i transition
frequency (150 Hz/Gauss2). Furthermore, because OH is
not completely case (a) (i.e. the electron’s orbital angu-
lar momentum and spin are slightly decoupled from the
axis) the g-factor is slightly larger in the upper doublet
[11]. Thus, transitions between the mF > 0 (mF < 0)
components are red-shifted (blue-shifted) relative to the
zero ﬁeld value. Hence for experiments probing both pos-
itive and negative mF components such as this work, the
g-factor diﬀerence leads to a broadening and eventually a
bifurcation in the lineshape for increasing magnetic ﬁeld.
This eﬀect, explored at relatively large ﬁelds (0.6 - 0.9
T), was found to shift the ∆F = 0 transition frequencies
of the |2, ±2, +i, |2, −1, +i, and |1, 1, +i states at a rate
of -sign(mF ) × 2.7 kHz/Gauss, and the |1, −1, +i and
|2, 1, +i states at a rate of -sign(mF ) × 0.9 kHz/Gauss
[11]. For even population distribution this eﬀect leads to
a shift of 450 Hz/Gauss and -900 Hz/Gauss for the 2→2
and 1→1 transitions, respectively.

Shown in Fig. 1(b) is a schematic of our experimen-
tal setup. OH molecules seeded in Xenon are created
in a pulsed discharge [12] producing a molecular pulse
with a mean speed of 410 m/s and 10% longitudinal ve-
locity spread. Following a skimmer is an electrostatic
hexapole used to transversely couple the molecules into
our Stark decelerator, which is described in detail else-
where [9, 13, 14]. The Stark decelerator is used in a vari-
ety of operating conditions, yielding pulses of molecules
at a density of 106 cm−3 with mean speeds chosen be-
tween 410 m/s and 50 m/s with longitudinal tempera-
tures between 1 K and 5 mK, respectively. Once the
molecular pulse exits the decelerator it is focused by a
second hexapole to the detection region. Located be-
tween the second hexapole and the detection region is

a 10 cm long cylindrical microwave cavity with its axis
aligned to the molecular beam. The microwave cavity
is operated near the TM010 mode, such that the electric
ﬁeld is extremely uniform over the region sampled by the
molecules [15]. The microwave cavity is surrounded by
highly magnetically permeable material to provide shield-
ing from stray magnetic ﬁelds. From measurements of
the magnetically sensitive F = 2→F = 1 transition fre-
quency the residual ﬁeld in the cavity was determined
to be < 2 milliGauss. This small ﬁeld results in an ab-
solute Zeeman shift of < 0.9 Hz and < 1.8 Hz for the
2→2 and 1→1 transitions, respectively. Note that this is
a cautious upper-bound on the Zeeman shift, since it is
based on work performed at ∼107 larger magnetic ﬁeld
where the angular momentum decoupling is enhanced.
Furthermore, it was veriﬁed within experimental resolu-
tion that there were no transition frequency shifts due to
stray electric ﬁelds.

Two independently switchable microwave synthesizers,
both referenced to a Cesium standard, are used to pro-
vide the microwave radiation for driving the λ-doublet
transitions. For probing the |2, mF , +i → |2, mF , −i λ-
doublet transition (2→2) only one synthesizer is needed
since the molecules enter the cavity in the F = 2 state.
Accordingly, two synthesizers are needed for probing the
1→1 transition. The ﬁrst synthesizer transfers molecules
from the F = 2 upper doublet state to the F = 1 lower
doublet state. The second synthesizer then probes the
1→1 transition. After the molecules exit the cavity
the population of the upper doublet is probed by laser-
induced ﬂuorescence (LIF). For the LIF measurement
the molecules are excited along the 2Σ1/2(v = 1) ←
2Π3/2(v = 0) line at 282 nm by light produced from a
doubled pulsed-dye laser. This excited state decays pri-
marily along 2Σ1/2(v = 1) → 2Π3/2(v = 1) at 313 nm.
The red-shifted ﬂuorescence is collected and imaged onto
a photomultiplier tube coupled to a multi-channel scaler.
To characterize the performance of the microwave cav-
ity the population in the upper doublet was recorded as
a function of applied microwave pulse length as shown

3

(i.e. a 2π pulse for the |mF | = 1 and a 4π pulse for
the |mF | = 2 transitions). This was done so that pop-
ulation revivals occurred at velocities that were integer
sub-multiples of 400 m/s. While the behavior agrees well
with the expected (dotted line), there are two noticeable
deviations. First, for 270 m/s ≤ v ≤ 400 m/s the fringe
visibility is less than expected. This is because, as de-
tailed in our earlier work [13, 14], molecules with these
relatively high velocities have not been decelerated out of
the background molecular pulse. Thus, molecules with a
large distribution of speeds (as compared to the deceler-
ated molecules) are detected, leading to reduced contrast.
Second, substantial decoherence is observed for v ≤ 130
m/s. The source of this decoherence has been experi-
mentally determined as the result of microwave radiation
leaking from the cavity and being reﬂected oﬀ the decel-
erator back into the cavity. It is interesting to note that
since the metal detection tube acts as a waveguide with
a cut-oﬀ frequency much higher than that applied, no
radiation leaks from the rear of the cavity. Thus, future
experiments should include a small waveguide section on
both sides of the cavity to prevent leakage. Furthermore,
because this decoherence is due to reﬂected radiation it
is microwave power dependent, and presents no problem
for the transitions frequency measurements, which use <
10% of the microwave power used in Fig. 2, such that no
noticeable decoherence occurs.

Because two magnetic sub-levels with diﬀering ωR’s
undergo the 2→2 transition,
the traditional Rabi-
spectroscopy method of applying a π pulse over the
length of the cavity is not optimal. Thus, for measure-
ments of the 2→2 transition frequency the microwave
power was chosen such that for δ = 0 the maximum con-
trast was produced with as small a microwave power as
possible (i.e. transfer the molecules to the ﬁrst dip in
Fig. 2(a) over the length of the cavity). Representa-
tive data for the 2→2 transition is shown in Fig. 3(a)
where the driving frequency, f, is varied under a ﬁxed
microwave power. Data points in this graph were gener-
ated by comparing the population in the upper doublet
at the detection region with and without the probing mi-
crowave ﬁeld. The ﬁt to the data (solid line) is generated
from the typical Rabi lineshape formula except contribu-
tions from the diﬀerent magnetic sub-levels are included.
For probing the 1→1 transition it is necessary to prepare
the molecules in a F = 1 level since they originate in the
|2, mF , +i level from the Stark decelerator. This is ac-
complished by using the ﬁrst 70 µs the molecules spend
in the cavity to drive them on the satellite 2→1 line,
yielding molecules in the |1, ±1, −i and |1, 0, −i states
(downward dotted arrows in Fig. 1). The remaining
time the molecules spend in the cavity (depending on v)
is then used to probe the 1→1 transition frequency by
applying a π pulse, which transfers only the |mF | = 1
molecules to the upper doublet (upward dotted arrows
in Fig. 1). Representative data for the 1→1 transition is

transitions. Both measurements correspond to an interaction
time of 0.5 ms (v = 200 m/s). A center frequency is extracted

2(a) (so-called Rabi-ﬂopping). For the data
in Fig.
shown, the molecules were decelerated to 200 m/s and
a microwave pulse resonant with the 2→2 transition
was applied such that its midpoint time coincided with
the molecules being at the cavity center. Thus, as the
pulse length was increased the molecules encountered
a pulse that grew symmetrically about the cavity cen-
ter. Because the LIF detection scheme is sensitive to
all molecules in the upper doublet and the applied mi-
crowave ﬁeld simultaneously drives transitions between
the diﬀerent magnetic sub-levels, the Rabi-ﬂopping sig-
2
nal is more complicated than the traditional sin
).
Here ω′
R is the eﬀective Rabi frequency given in terms
of the detuning, δ, and Rabi frequency, ωR, as ω′
R =
pδ2 + ω2
R, and tp is the microwave pulse length. As
shown in Fig. 1(a) for the 2→2 transition (solid arrows),
both the |mF | = 2 and |mF | = 1 magnetic sub-levels are
driven by the microwave ﬁeld (the |mF | = 0 level has
a zero transition moment). Because the electric dipole
transition moment of the |mF | = 2 is twice that of |mF | =
1 [16], the Rabi-ﬂopping signal exhibits beating. The cal-
culated individual magnetic sub-level contributions are
shown at the bottom of Fig. 2(a) with their sum repre-
sented by the dashed line plotted over the data. The data
points were determined by comparing the populations in
the upper doublet at the detection region with and with-
out the microwave ﬁeld applied. Clearly, the behavior is
exactly as expected until tp ≥ 300 µs when ωR of both
the |mF | = 2 and |mF | = 1 transitions appears to de-
crease. This reduction in ωR is the result of the electric
ﬁeld diminishing near the cavity end-caps [17].

Alternatively to ﬁxing the molecular velocity, v, and
varying tp, the Stark decelerator allows v to be varied
while applying a ﬁxed (spatial) length microwave pulse.
This allows a check of systematics associated with beam
velocity. Data taken in this manner is shown in Fig. 2b,
where a microwave pulse resonant with the 2→2 transi-
tion was applied for the entire time the molecules were
in the cavity. The microwave power for this measure-
ment was chosen such that molecules with a 400 m/s
velocity underwent one complete population oscillation

4

same microwave cavity was also used to measure the tran-
sition frequencies as seen in Fig. 5 with a resolution com-
parable to the reported Rabi measurements. However,
because the molecular pulses are extremely monochro-
matic, minimal gain was observed in the recovered signal-
to-noise ratio. This technique will of course be critical
for any future molecular fountain clock. The molecu-
lar clock could enjoy reduced systematic shifts, such as
the magnetic ﬁeld insensitive transitions demonstrated
in this work. It will be most interesting to compare an
atomic clock against a molecular one which depends dif-
ferently on the ﬁne structure constant.

In summary, microwave spectroscopy was performed
on slow, cold molecular pulses produced by a Stark de-
celerator resulting in the most precise measurement of
the OH ∆F = 0, λ-doublet transitions. These results
along with appropriate astrophysical measurement of OH
megamasers can be used to produce constraints on ∆α/α
with a sensitivity of 1 ppm over the last ∼1010 yr. At
the same time the use of cold molecules for the most
precise molecular spectroscopy has been demonstrated.
Speciﬁcally, by producing slow, cold molecular packets
the Stark decelerator allows increased interrogation time,
while virtually eliminating any velocity broadening.

shown in Fig. 3b. In contrast to the 2→2, line the LIF
signal is maximum on resonance because molecules are
being transferred into the detected upper doublet. Also,
because only 40% of the population participate in the
transitions (i.e. the |mF | = 1) the contrast between on
and oﬀ resonance is reduced relative to the 2→2 transi-
tion, leading to a slightly larger error for determining the
center frequency. For both panels of Fig. 3 the molecules
were decelerated to 200 m/s yielding linewidths of 2 kHz.
A typical ﬁt determines the center frequency within 20 to
50 Hz, depending on the transition. The results of several
measurements of both the 2→2 and 1→1 center frequen-
cies are displayed in Fig. 4. Each point and its error
bar represents the result of a ﬁt to a measured lineshape
like those shown in Fig. 3. Using the standard error of
each ﬁt as a weight the mean and standard error of the
transition frequencies are found to be (1 667 358 996 ±
4) Hz and (1 665 401 803 ± 12) Hz for the 2→2 and 1→1,
respectively. For comparison, the lightly hatched boxes
represent the bounds set on the transition frequency by
the previous best measurement [7], while the limits pro-
duced by this measurement are displayed as darker cross-
hatched boxes. The transition frequencies reported here

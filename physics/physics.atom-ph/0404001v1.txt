We present observations of VUV transitions between doubly excited sextet states in O IV, F V
and Ne VI. Spectra were produced by collisions of an O+, (FH)+ and Ne+ beam with a solid carbon
target. Some observed lines are assigned to the 1s2s2p23p 6L-1s2p33p 6P electric-dipole transitions
in O IV, F V and Ne VI, and are compared with results of MCHF (with QED and higher-order
corrections) and MCDF calculations. 31 new lines have been identiﬁed. The sextet systems of
boronlike ions are possible candidates for x-ray and VUV lasers.

INTRODUCTION

The sextet systems of boronlike ions are possible can-
didates for x-ray and VUV lasers [1], and have been in-
vestigated recently. The lowest terms of these systems
(1s2s2p3 6S, 1s2s2p23s 6P and 1s2s2p33d 6P) have been
studied along B I isoelectronic sequence [2, 3, 4]. The
studies of higher excited sextet states (1s2p33s 6S) have
been lately reported [1]. However, energy level diagrams
of these ions are still far from complete. Experimentally,
these levels are diﬃcult to observe by conventional spec-
troscopic techniques, such as high voltage discharge in
gas cell method, because these levels lie well above several
ionization limits of ﬁve-electron singlet states (see Fig.
1). Even though they are metastable against autoioniza-
tion, they usually de-excite and disappear by collisions
with other ions without radiative transitions. Fast beam-
foil technique allows straight forward observations of ra-
diative transitions produced by these sextet states [5, 6].

In 1992 beam-foil spectroscopy [2, 3] was used to pro-
vide initial data on low-lying sextet states in doubly ex-
cited boronlike nitrogen, oxygen and ﬂuorine. Recent
work of Lapierre and Knystautas [3] on possible sextet
transitions in Ne VI highlights the signiﬁcance in this se-
quence. They measured several excitation energies and
lifetimes. Fine structures of the 1s2s2p23s 6PJ states
were resolved and measured in O IV, F V and Ne VI
by Lin and Berry et al [1]. There are no further results
reported for transitions from highly excited sextet states.
In some works on beam-foil spectroscopy of sextet
states in B I isoelectronic sequence, their identiﬁcations
show rather weak lines and overwhelming blending prob-

lems. Hence, accurate theoretical studies of sextet states
in B I isoelectronic sequence are strongly needed to help
identiﬁcations. However, theoretical analysis of these
ﬁve-electron systems is diﬃcult because strong electron
correlation, relativistic corrections, and even QED eﬀects
have to be included in the calculations [1, 4, 7]. Recent
line identiﬁcations in the sextet systems were made on
the basis of MCHF and MCDF [1, 2, 4, 8] or on the ba-
sis of Z-expansion along B I isoelectronic sequence [1, 3].
From these works 6 terms were determined.

The sextet states 1s2s2p23p 6L, L=S, P, D and 1s2p33p
6P in B I isoelectronic sequence are well above several
ionization levels as shown in Fig.
1, and metastable
against electric-dipole radiative decay to singly excited
ﬁve-electron states and against Coulomb autoionization
into the adjacent continuum 1s22l’2l”nl 4L due to diﬀer-
ent spin multiplicity. Thus, main decay channel is radia-

tion in fast beam-foil experiments.

In this work, fast beam-foil spectra of oxygen were
recorded at Liege using grating incidence spectrometers.
Spectra of ﬂuorine and neon were previously recorded
at Lyon and Argonne. The 1s2s2p23p 6L - 1s2p33p 6P,
L=S, P, D electric-dipole transitions in O IV, F V and Ne
VI have been searched in these spectra. Comparisons are
given with results of MCHF (with QED and higher-order
corrections) and MCDF calculations.

II. EXPERIMENT

The experiments were performed on a standard fast
beam-foil excitation system at a Van de Graaﬀ accelera-
tor beam line at the University of Liege [6, 15, 16, 17, 18].
To produce spectra of oxygen in the wavelength region
near 660-710 ˚A a beam current of about 1.3 µA of 32O+
2
and 16O+ ions at an beam energy of 1.5 and 1.7 MeV was
yielded. Such energies were expected to be an optimum
for comparison and production of O3+ ions by ion-foil
interaction [19].

The beam current goes through a carbon exciter foil.
The foils were made from a glow discharge, had surface
densities about 10-20 µg/cm2 and lasted for 1-2 hours
under the above radiation.

VUV radiation emitted by excited oxygen ions was dis-
persed by a 1m- Seya-Namioka grating-incidence spec-
trometer at about 90 degrees to the ion beam direc-
tion. A low-noise channeltron (below 1 count/min) was
served as a detector. Spectra were recorded at energies
of 1.5 and 1.7 MeV with 100/100 µm slits (the line width
(FWHM) was 1.1 ˚A) and 40/40 µm slits (the line width
(FWHM) was 0.7 ˚A) in the wavelength range of 660-710
˚A.

We also reinvestigated unpublished beam-foil spectra
of 16O3+, 19F4+ and 20Ne5+ ions recorded previously by
accelerating 16O+, 20(FH)+ and 20Ne+ ions to energies of
2.5 MeV, 2.5 MeV and 4.0 MeV at the University of Lyon
and Argonne National Lab. The line widths (FWHM)
were 0.4 ˚A, 0.8 ˚A and 0.3 ˚A in the wavelength range of
660-710 ˚A, 560-640 ˚A and 490-540 ˚A in above spectra,
respectively.

III. RESULTS

Figs. 2(a) -2(c) display three typical spectra of oxygen
at beam energies of 1.5, 1.7 and 2.5 MeV in the wave-
length range of 660-710 ˚A. In the wavelength region of
665-675 ˚A the 1s2s2p23p 6Do-1s2p33p 6P transitions in O
+ beam energy of 1.5 MeV,
IV were expected. At an O2
+ ions are mainly excited to terms of O2+ and O3+.
O2
There are no lines emitted from sextet states in O IV
in Fig. 2(a). At an O+ beam energy of 1.7 MeV, O+
ions are mainly excited to terms of O3+ and O4+. New
and unidentiﬁed emissions appear in the spectrum in Fig.
2(b). Fig. 2(c) shows a spectrum with better resolution

to see details of lines. For the 1s2s2p23p 6Lo-1s2p33p
6P, L=S, P, D transitions we expected to partially re-
solve ﬁne structures of the lower states 1s2s2p23p 6Lo
J ,
L=S, P, D in the experiments, whereas ﬁne structures of
the upper state 1s2p33p 6PJ are so close and less than
resolution of the experimental spectra. A promising can-
didate for the 1s2s2p23p 6Do
9/2-1s2p33p 6P7/2 transition
at 668.95±0.08 ˚A appears in spectra recorded at 1.7 and
2.5 MeV O+ ion beam energies (labelled as D in Figs.
2(b) and 2(c)), which does not appear in the spectrum
recorded at 1.2 MeV O+
2 ion beam energy. Well-known
transitions of O V 3p-4d, O IV 2s23p-2s25s, O V 2s3d-
2s4f and O III 2s22p2-2s2p3 are at 659.589 ˚A, 670.601
˚A, 681.332 ˚A and 703.854 ˚A respectively, close to the
neighborhood of the doubly excited sextet transitions.
The four wavelengths have been semiempirically ﬁtted
with high accuracy of ±0.004 ˚A by [20, 21, 22] and pro-
vided a good calibration for the measurements. Standard
error for wavelength calibration is 0.01 ˚A in the region
of 660-710 ˚A. Nonlinear least-squared ﬁttings of Gaus-
sian proﬁles gave values for wavelengths, intensities and

full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of lines. Uncer-
tainties of wavelengths are related to intensities of lines.
Through the use of optical refocusing we achieved spec-
troscopic linewidths of 0.7 and 0.4 ˚A in Fig. 2(b) and
2(c). The precision of the proﬁle-ﬁtting program was
checked through several known transition wavelengths.

where ci is a conﬁguration interaction coeﬃcient, N is
total number of conﬁgurations with the same LSJMJ
and parity, and φ(ßi,LS=5/2JMJ) is a conﬁguration state
function (CSF).

Firstly, single-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock (SCHF) cal-
culations where conﬁgurations are the desired levels, i.e.,
1s2s2p23p or 1s2p33p, were performed. After updating
the MCHF codes, we carried out relativistic calculations
with an initial expansion of up to 4000 CSFs and a full
Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian matrix. For a ﬁve-electron sys-
tem a CI expansion generated by a active set leads to
a large number of expansions. To reduce the number of
conﬁgurations, we chose conﬁgurations n1l1n2l2 n3l3 n4l4
n5l5, where ni=1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, li=0, ...min (4, ni-1).
We did not include g electrons for n=5 shell. For MCHF
calculations of the lower states 1s2s2p23p 6L, L=S, P,
D, we chose 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d and 5s
electrons to compose conﬁgurations. For the 1s2p33p
6P state we chose 1s through 4d electrons. Fine struc-
ture splitting is strongly involved in the experiments and
identiﬁcations. After determining radial wavefunctions,
we included relativistic operators of mass correction, one-
and two-body Darwin terms and spin-spin contact term
in both SCHF and MCHF calculations; these were not
included by Miecznik et al [4].

In addition, we used the screened hydrogenic formula
from [1, 12, 13, 14] to estimate quantum electrodynamic
eﬀects (QED), and higher-order relativistic contributions
for sextet states in ﬁve-electron oxygen, ﬂuorine and
neon.

In MCDF [9, 10, 11] approach, ﬁrstly, we used single-
conﬁguration Dirac-Fock approach (SCDF). A basis of
jj-coupled states to all possible total angular momenta J
from two non-relativistic conﬁgurations, 1s2s2p23p and
1s2p33p, was considered. For convergence we included
the ground state 1s22s22p of ﬁve-electron systems. After
calculating all possible levels for all J, eigenvectors were
regrouped in a basis of LS terms. To obtain better evalua-
tions of correlation energies of the sextet terms 1s2s2p23p

in the experimental spectrum of oxygen at the energy of 2.5
MeV. Units of intensities are arbitrary.

6L, L=S, P, D and 1s2p33p 6P in O IV, F V and Ne
VI, improved calculations included 1s22s22p, 1s22s2p2,
1s2s22p2, 1s2s2p3, 1s2s2p23s, 1s2s2p23p, 1s2s2p23d,
1s2p33s, 1s2p33p, 1s2p33d, 1s2p34s, 1s2p34p and 1s2p34d
mixing non-relativistic conﬁgurations.

In GRASP code QED eﬀects, self-energy and vacuum
polarization correction, were taken into account by using
eﬀective nuclear charge Zef f in the formulas of QED ef-
fects, which comes from an analogous hydrogenic orbital
with the same expectation value of r as the MCDF-orbital
in question [9, 10, 11].

Most of new identiﬁcations have been obtained by
searching in the spectra for sets of unidentiﬁed lines
and by comparing energies and relative intensities of
the 1s2s2p23p 6Lo-1s2p33p 6P, L=D, P and S transi-

approaches.
3(a) are details of the
1s2s2p23p 6Do-1s2p33p 6P transition in O IV recorded
at an O+ ion energy of 2.5 MeV. The curve SCHF’
is convoluted theoretical proﬁle of ﬁne structure com-
ponents with a Gaussian function. The experimen-
tal width of 0.4 ˚A for the oxygen spectrum was uti-
lized. The transition rates to ﬁne structure j=9/3 to
3/2 of the lower state were results of single-conﬁguration
Hartree-Fock (SCHF) calculations by this work. The
wavelengths of ﬁne structure components were calculated
SCHF results plus a ﬁtted shift for all ﬁve components.
Measured wavelength of a component is the weighted
center of the ﬁtted proﬁle of experimental data. Ex-
perimental transition rate is proportional to area of a
peak (ﬁtted intensity×FWHM of the experimental data).
The curve ”Sum” is summation of ﬁtted ﬁne structure
components of experimental data. Measured ratio of
J=9/2-7/2, J=7/2-*, J=5/2-*, J=3/2-* and J=1/2-*
transition rates at an ion energy of 2.5 MeV in Fig.
is about 121×0.4:76×0.4:66×0.4:55×0.4:27×0.4

the upper state 1s2p33p 6Pj allowed by electric-dipole
transition rule. The ratio is slightly diﬀerent from the
theoretical ratio of GF values of SCHF calculations of
0.981:0.593:0.530:0.355:0.294 = 4.98:3.99:3.00:2.00:1.00.
Based on above analysis we assign the set of lines as the
1s2s2p23p 6Do-1s2p33p 6P transition in O IV, and de-
termine their wavelengths with good accuracy of ±0.08
˚A. The results are listed in Table I. The strongest transi-
tion related to ﬁne structure components is the 1s2s2p23p
9/2-1s2p33p 6P7/2 transition at the wavelength of
6Do
668.95±0.08 ˚A.

Spectral details of the 1s2s2p23p 6So

5/2-1s2p33p 6Pj
transition are shown in Fig. 3(b). The width of the line
is wider than the experimental width of a resonance line
of 0.4 ˚A, but not wide enough to resolve ﬁne structures
of the upper state 1s2p33p 6P. In the experimental pro-
ﬁle, experimental separation of ﬁne structures of the up-
per state seems larger than results of SCHF calculations.
Similar to above, after studying details of transitions the-
oretically and experimentally described above, and com-
paring with multi-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock (MCHF)
and multi-conﬁguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) calculations
of O IV by this work, we were able to assign these uniden-
tiﬁed observed lines as the 1s2s2p23p 6Lo-1s2p33p 6P,
L=D, P and S electric-dipole transitions in O IV. Results
of the identiﬁcation and measurements of wavelengths of
the transitions are listed in Table I. Errors of wavelengths
of ±0.08 ˚A are small mainly from calibration and curve
ﬁtting. The latter includes experimental and statistical
errors. In Table I average theoretical transition energy
AV is the center of gravity of the 1s2s2p23p 6Lo-1s2p33p
6P transition energies (computed from ﬁne structure lines
calculated by this work) with results of theoretical anal-
ysis. Experimental transition energy AV is the center of

gravity of the 1s2s2p23p 6Lo-1s2p33p 6P transition ener-
gies (computed from observed lines) with results of ex-
perimental transition rate analysis. AVT is summation of
above average transition energy (AV), QED eﬀect (QED)
and higher-order correction (HO). Errors for calculated
transition energies in Table I are the root mean squared
diﬀerences of calculated and experimental transition en-
ergies as given below in the table. We also list calculated
non-relativistic transition energies (N-REL). In Table I
we present measured ﬁne structure wavelength values and
compared these with diﬀerent theoretical values for O IV.
The experimental results are consistent with calculations
after considering experimental and theoretical errors.

Using similar experimental and theoretical analysis de-
scribed above, we studied spectra recorded at a (FH)+
beam energy of 2.5 MeV. Through the use of optical re-
focusing we achieved spectroscopic linewidth of 0.7 ˚A.
The wavelength accuracy is ±0.10 ˚A in the wavelength
region of 570-620 ˚A in the sprecta [23, 24].
In Table
II all observed lines in the sextet system of F V are
reported. Nine lines are new observations. For the
1s2s2p23p 6L-1s2p33p 6P transitions ﬁne structures of
the lower state 1s2s2p23p 6L are resolved in the exper-
iments. The strongest ﬁne structure component is the
1s2s2p23p 6Do
9/2-1s2p33p 6P7/2 transition at the wave-
length of 577.50±0.10 ˚A.

Similarly, we studied spectra recorded at a Ne+ beam
energy of 4.0 MeV. Through the use of optical refocusing
spectroscopic linewidth of 0.3 ˚A was achieved in the sec-
ond order spectra. Fine structures of the lower and upper
state are resolved. The wavelength accuracy is ±0.05 ˚A
for the 1s2s2p23p 6Lo
J -1s2p33p 6PJ ′, L=S, P, D transi-
tions in the wavelength region of 490-555 ˚A [25, 26]. In
Table III thirteen new observed lines in the sextet system
of Ne VI are reported. The strongest ﬁne structure com-
ponent is the 1s2s2p23p 6Do
9/2-1s2p33p 6P7/2 transition
at the wavelength of 507.13±0.05 ˚A.

In Figs. 4, 5 and 6 are plots of diﬀerences between
theoretical and experimental transition energies of the
1s2s2p23p 6Lo-1s2p33p 6P, L=D, P, S transitions along
bornlike isoelectronic sequence. Here, theoretical tran-
sition energy is the center of gravity of the 1s2s2p23p
6Lo-1s2p33p 6P transition energies (computed from ﬁne
structure lines calculated by this work) with results of
theoretical analysis, and experimental transition energy
is the center of gravity of the 1s2s2p23p 6Lo-1s2p33p 6P
transition energies (computed from observed lines) with
experimental results of transition rate analysis.

In Fig. 4 calculated SCHF and SCDF transition en-
ergy diﬀerences from experiments are constant for the
1s2s2p23p 6Do-1s2p33p 6P transitions for nuclear charge
Z = 8, 9 and 10. For MCDF and non-relativistic SCHF
calculations, diﬀerences are linear for nuclear charge Z

= 8, 9 and 10. For MCHF calculations for oxygen, the
diﬀerence is very small, just 22 cm−1.

In Fig. 5 SCDF diﬀerence is constant for the 1s2s2p23p
6Po-1s2p33p 6P transitions for nuclear charge Z = 8,
9 and 10. MCHF, SCHF, MCDF and non-relativistic
SCHF diﬀerences are linear for nuclear charge Z = 8, 9
and 10. MCHF diﬀerence for oxygen is 226 cm−1.

In Fig. 6 SCDF and non-relativistic SCHF diﬀerences
are constant for the 1s2s2p23p 6So-1s2p33p 6P transi-
tions for nuclear charge Z = 8, 9 and 10. MCHF, MCDF
and SCHF diﬀerences are linear for nuclear charge Z =
8, 9 and 10. SCHF diﬀerence for oxygen is 105 cm−1.
However, SCDF, MCHF and SCDF diﬀerences are quite
large, >4000 cm −1 for nuclear charge Z = 8, 9 and 10.
In ref. [27] energy diﬀerences for transitions related to
multiplet S states also show the same tendency. Above
linear and constant energy diﬀerences can be used to pre-
dict easily and with high accuracy transition energies for
the 1s2s2p23p 6Lo-1s2p33p 6P, L=S, P, D transitions for
boronlike ions with 5<Z<13.

6L-1s2p33p 6Po, L=D, P, and S transitions in O IV, F
V and Ne VI are up to -220-370 cm−1 (see Table I, II
and III), and cannot be ignored in careful comparisons
with experiments. We plot QED and higher-order cor-
rections to the mean 1s2s2p23p 6L-1s2p33p 6Po, L=D,
P, and S transition energies in Fig. 7. Here, QED and
higher-order corrections are calculated from Zef f val-
ues obtained from SCHF and MCHF results. For the
1s2s2p23p 6L-1s2p33p 6Po, L=D, P, and S transitions
in O IV, F V and Ne VI, QED eﬀects increase with Z
rapidly. Results in Fig. 7 show that mean transition
wavelengths are sensitive to QED eﬀects of 0.18 ˚A, 0.21
˚A and 0.22 ˚A for the 1s2s2p23p 6L-1s2p33p 6Po, L=D, P,
and S transitions in O IV, F V and Ne VI. They are at
the same level or larger than the estimated experimental

precision of ±0.06 ˚A, ±0.10 ˚A and ±0.05 ˚A.

Some spectral lines of boronlike ions remains uniden-
tiﬁed. In O IV notable lines at 666-668 ˚A show stable
characteristics in spectra in Fig. 2(b) and 2(c). Intensi-
ties measured at diﬀerent ion energies indicate the ﬁgures
should be classiﬁed as transitions from upper states with
doubly excited cores.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Fast beam-foil spectroscopic experiments have yielded
new information on doubly excited sextet states in boron-
like O IV, F V and Ne VI. We performed MCHF (with
QED and higher-order corrections) and MCDF calcula-

8

tions for 2s-2p transitions between doubly excited sextet
states of ﬁve-electron O IV, F V and Ne VI. Using calcu-
lated wavelengths and transition rates, we were able to
identify observed lines in fast beam-foil spectra of oxy-
gen, ﬂuorine and neon corresponding to the 1s2s2p23p
6Lo-1s2p33p 6P, L=S, P, D electric-dipole transitions in
O IV, F V and Ne VI, and to measure wavelengths with
good accuracy. The measured results are compared with
values of MCHD and MCDF calculations. They are in
reasonable tendency. To extract QED and higher-order
corrections, accurate electron correlation is required.

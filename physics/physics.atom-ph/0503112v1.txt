Abstrat. We disuss design onsiderations and the realization of a magneti double-well potential on an

atom hip using urrent-arrying wires. Stability requirements for the trapping potential lead to a typial

size of order mirons for suh a devie. We also present experiments using the devie to manipulate old,

trapped atoms.

α µ0 I/(4 π d3) where I is the urrent used to reate the
hexapole, d is the typial size of the urrent distribution
reating the magneti (cid:28)eld (see Fig. 4) and α is a geometri-

al fator lose to unity. Adding a uniform transverse mag-

neti (cid:28)eld b = b(cos θb x + sin θb y) will split the hexapole

into two quadrupoles, thus realizing a double-well poten-

tial. The two minima are separated by a distane 2 X0

In the Rabi regime, an initial phase di(cid:27)erene of π/2

NC/N . One motivation to attain the Rabi regime is

to

the same height. This shift has to be preisely anelled

to allow the observation of unperturbed phase osillations

sible size of the urrent distribution d and on the spaing
between the two wells X0 .

The geometry of the magneti double-well is deter-

mined by four experimental parameters: I the urrent re-

Bz the longitudinal magneti (cid:28)eld and b the transverse

with only two free parameters whih may be hosen as the

size of the soure d and the distane between the wells X0 .

We now turn to the alulation of the (cid:29)utuations

of the gravitational energy shift between the two wells.

Transverse magneti (cid:28)eld (cid:29)utuations lead to (cid:29)utuations

∆h = ∆b/(A X0) of the height di(cid:27)erene between the two

wells. The assoiated (cid:29)utuations of the gravitational en-

ergy di(cid:27)erene have to be small ompared to the tunnel-

ing energy so that the phase di(cid:27)erene between the wells

We have used the same saling law as before for the ur-

numerial parameters as for the (cid:28)rst ondition. The inter-

setion of the two possible domains we have alulated for

X0 and d orresponds to the gray area in (cid:28)gure 3. The
main result is that the harateristi size of the soure d
has to be smaller than 7.5 µm in order to ahieve a rea-

sonable stability of the double-well. This motivates the

use of atom hips to reate a magneti double-well where

the dashed line shows the area below whih the (cid:29)utuations

As (cid:28)rst proposed in [8℄, the simplest sheme to obtain a

hexapolar magneti (cid:28)eld on an atom hip uses two wires

and an external uniform (cid:28)eld (see Fig. 4.a). Denoting 2 d

the distane between the two wires, the value of the ex-

ternal (cid:28)eld has to be B0 = µ0 I/(2 π d). One then obtains
a hexapole loated at a distane d from the surfae of

the hip. This on(cid:28)guration leads to a geometrial fator

α = 1. In order to safely lie in the stability domain in
(cid:28)gure 3, one an hoose d = 5 µm. This leads to a urrent

wires using a single power supply. The extra onnetions

are used to add a urrent in the entral wire in order to

split the hexapole into two quadrupoles without any ex-

ternal magneti (cid:28)eld. We an also hange the urrent in

the left (right) pair of wires in order to release the atoms

from the left (right) trap when the separation between the

wells is large enough. The transverse wires onneting the

4.1 Splitting of a thermal loud

In order to load the double-well with a sample of old

87

Rb atoms, the (cid:28)ve wire hip is glued onto an atom hip

like that used in a previous experiment to produe a Bose-

Einstein ondensate [17℄. The (cid:28)ve wire hip surfae is lo-

ated approximately 150 µm above the surfae of the other

hip. This two-hip design allows one to ombine wires

having very di(cid:27)erent sizes (typially 50 µm × 10 µm for
the (cid:28)rst hip and 700 nm × 700 nm for the (cid:28)ve wire hip)

and therefore di(cid:27)erent urrent-arrying apaities in a sin-

gle devie. Large urrents are needed to e(cid:30)iently apture

the atoms from a MOT in the magneti trap.

Using evaporative ooling, we prepare a sample of old

atoms in a Io(cid:27)e trap reated by a Z-shaped wire on the

(cid:28)rst hip and a onstant external (cid:28)eld. Transfer of the

atoms to the double-well potential is ahieved by ramping

down the urrent in the Z-shaped wire and the external

(cid:28)eld while we ramp up the urrents in the (cid:28)ve wires. The

(cid:28)nal value of the urrent in the entral wire is smaller

(10.4 mA) than for the one in the other wires (17.5 mA).

We use the fat that an imbalaned urrent in the en-

transverse (cid:28)eld to the hexapole. Ignoring the (cid:28)eld due to

the lower hip, these urrent values lead to two trapping

minima loated on the y -axis. The position of the upper

minimum is superimposed on the position of the Io(cid:27)e trap

due to the lower hip. We typially transfer of order 104
atoms having a temperature below 1 µK.

To realize a splitting experiment, we then inrease the

urrent in the entral wire to 17.5 mA and derease the

urrent in the other wires to 15 mA. The duration of the

ramp is 20 ms. If the external transverse (cid:28)eld is zero, the

two traps loated on the y -axis oalese when all the ur-
rents are equal and then split along the x-axis when the

urrent in the entral wire is above the one in the other

wires. Then, by lowering the urrent in the left (right)

wires to zero, we eliminate the atoms in the left (right)

The design allows one to send the same urrent with a single

trap and measure the number of atoms remaining in the

power supply in all the wires to reate a magneti hexapole.

The onnetions on the entral wires allow us to imbalane the

urrents between the entral wire, the two left wires and the

other trap using absorption imaging. If the external mag-

neti (cid:28)eld has a small omponent along the y -axis, the

two right wires.

oalesene point is avoided and the atoms initially in

(cid:28)ve wires at their ends insure the longitudinal on(cid:28)nement

of the atoms in a box like potential.

The distane d haraterizing the wire spaing is 5 µm.

the upper trap preferentially go in the right (left) trap

if by is positive (negative). The number of atoms in the
left or in the right well as a funtion of by is plotted in

(cid:28)gure 6. As expeted, we observe a 50% split between

the two wells if the two traps oalese using by = 0. For
an amplitude of the magneti (cid:28)eld by larger than 0.6 G,

the transferred fration of atoms is almost zero. For this

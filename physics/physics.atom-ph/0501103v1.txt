Abstract

Laser spectroscopy studies are being prepared to measure the 1s ground state hyperﬁne splitting in trapped cold
highly charged ions. The purpose of such experiments is to test quantum electrodynamics in the strong electric ﬁeld
regime. These experiments form part of the HITRAP project at GSI. A brief review of the planned experiments
is presented.

Key words: Highly charged ion, hyperﬁne splitting, laser spectroscopy

1. Introduction

An accurate measurement of the hyperﬁne split-
ting (HFS) of the 1s ground state of hydrogen-like
highly charged ions (HCI) is a good test of quan-
tum electrodynamics (QED) in the limit of strong
electric ﬁelds (1015 V/cm [1]). Such strong ﬁelds
cannot be produced using conventional laboratory
techniques, but naturally exist close to the stripped
nuclei of heavy elements like Pb, Bi or U. By de-
tecting the ﬂuorescence from the laser-excited up-
per hyperﬁne state of such a trapped and cold ion, a
high-precision measurement of the hyperﬁne split-
ting can be made.

HCI with extremely high charge states (e.g.
Pb81+ or U92+) and relativistic energies (400 MeV/u)
are created in the heavy ion facility (SIS) at GSI

in Darmstadt. These HCI are injected into the
Experimental Storage Ring (ESR) and can be de-
celerated (down to 4 MeV/u) forming 1 µs long
bunches containing about 105 ions, arriving every
10 seconds. In the HITRAP project [2,3] these
bunches will be extracted from the ESR, decel-
erated by linear (IH-LINAC) and radiofrequency
(RFQ) stages, trapped and cooled in a Penning
trap (cooler trap), and made available for experi-
ments.

In the ESR at GSI, previous measurements of
the HFS were made on bunches of relativistic HCI
such as 209Bi82+ [4] and 207Pb81+ [5]. HFS mea-
surements were also made at the SuperEBIT on
165Ho66+ [6], 185,187Re74+ [7] and 203,205Tl80+ [8].
The resolution obtained in the above experiments
is mainly limited by the Doppler eﬀect. A mea-
surement of the 1s ground state HFS of trapped
cold HCI using laser spectroscopy should be even
more accurate due to a cryogenic UHV environ-

ment, high ion cloud density, the absence of a large
Doppler shift and virtually unlimited measurement
time.

Laser spectroscopy oﬀers the possibility of high-
accuracy measurements of transition wavelengths
in the visible region [9]. In HCI, electronic transi-
tions are generally in the far UV or X-ray regions
of the spectrum. However, since the 1s groundstate
HFS scales with the atomic number Z as Z 3, the
ground state HFS of hydrogen-like HCI can move
into the visible spectrum for Z > 70 [1,10]. The
lifetime of this transition falls as Z −9 and is of the
order of milliseconds for Z > 70. A measurement
of this transition wavelength gives information on
the QED corrections to the HFS or on the spatial
distribution of the nuclear magnetisation (Bohr-
Weisskopf eﬀect), which is aﬀected by core polar-
isation and is not really well understood [1]. Its
measurement thus allows for critical tests of nu-
clear models. From a comparison of measurements
of the HFS of hydrogen-like and lithium-like HCI
the nuclear eﬀects can be eliminated so that an
accurate measurement of the QED eﬀects can be
made [11,12].

There are several candidate systems that can
be studied at HITRAP, including radioactive iso-
topes. An interesting ﬁrst challenge would be to
measure the HFS of the 1s ground state M 1 tran-
sition of 207Pb81+ ions (λ = 1020 nm [5]) by means
of laser spectroscopy. In order to reach the neces-
sary accuracy, the HCI will be trapped in a cryo-
genic UHV environment. Once trapped, the ions
can be easily stored for long times, therefore the
lifetime τ = 50 ms [5] of the upper hyperﬁne state
is not a problem. Electron capture (neutralisation)
by collisions is strongly reduced by operating the
trap at cryogenic temperatures (4 K) under UHV
conditions (below 10−14 mbar).

for the 1s ground state HFS in hydrogen, which has
nuclear spin I = 1/2. For hydrogen the HFS can
be easily calculated using the famous Breit-Rabi
formula [14]. The zero-ﬁeld splitting A is modiﬁed
by the interaction between the magnetic moment
µ of the ion and the magnetic ﬁeld strength B. In
the simple hydrogen case at a ﬁeld of 1 T, the Zee-
man splitting of about 2.8 · 1010 Hz is more than
one order of magnitude larger than the HFS in hy-
drogen (1.4 · 109 Hz or 21 cm). However, for HCI
the HFS dominates the Zeeman splitting by sev-
eral orders of magnitude. This is indicated in ﬁg-
ure 1b) for the 1s ground state HFS of 207Pb81+,
which also has nuclear spin I = 1/2.

In ﬁgure 2 the calculated wavelengths of the 1s
ground state hyperﬁne transition (neglecting QED
and the Bohr-Weisskopf eﬀect) are plotted for HCI
with atomic number Z ranging from 50 to 100.

2. Zeeman versus hyperﬁne splitting

The high precision measurements of the HFS will
be performed on HCI in a Penning trap, but the
strong magnetic ﬁeld will shift and split the hyper-
ﬁne levels and thus the natural HFS. This ‘Zeeman
eﬀect’ [13] is schematically illustrated in ﬁgure 1a)

Most of these heavier elements have their HFS in
the visible region of the spectrum and are thus eas-
ily excited by conventional tunable laser systems.

3. The spectroscopy trap

The HCI will be extracted from the HITRAP
cooler trap in a long narrow bunch with an average
kinetic energy of a few eV and containing about
105 ions. The radial energy spread will be reduced
so as to maintain a parallel beam [3]. The HCI will
then be loaded into the spectroscopy trap, which is
a cylindrical open-endcap Penning trap [15] with
compensation electrodes to create a nearly per-
fect quadrupole potential at the trap centre. Fig-
ure 3 schematically shows the expected layout of
the electrodes, the tank circuit for resistive cooling
[16,17] and the trap loading scheme: the HCI en-
ter from the right, are reﬂected by the left capture
electrode, enclosed by the right one, localised near
the trap centre and ﬁnally cooled and compressed.
resistive cooling is fairly
straightforward and well-known: the axial motion
of the HCI in the trap induces image charges in
the open-endcap electrodes, which can readily be
detected by a frequency resonant electronic tank
circuit (LCR-ﬁlter) attached to the electrodes.

The principle of

If the tank circuit is at cryogenic temperatures
(4 K), kinetic energy of the HCI is dissipated by
the circuit, thus eﬀectively cooling the ions. Since
the cooling time varies with the charge state q
of the ions as 1/q2, this cooling scheme is very
eﬀective for HCI [18].

After the cooling procedure, the HCI will be fo-
cussed into a smaller cloud using the rotating wall
technique [19,20]. If the coupling of an ion plasma
in a Penning trap is strong enough, the density of
the ion cloud depends on its global rotation fre-
quency. By applying RF voltages to a segmented
ring electrode, the radial electric quadrupole ﬁeld
will rotate and drive the ion cloud. There are two
limits for the rotation frequency ν. The lower limit,
which leads to the minimal density, is reached when
ν equals the single-ion magnetron frequency νm. At
the upper limit, when ν is set to half the cyclotron
frequency νc, the density is maximum (Brillouin
limit). (See e.g. [21,22] for the equations of motion
of an ion in a Penning trap.)

Realistic values for the Penning trap are: a mag-
netic ﬁeld of 6 T, an applied potential of 500 V, an
ion cloud temperature of 4 K, and a trap parame-
ter d = 17 mm (see Ref [15]). These values lead to
the trap frequencies νm = 23 kHz, νc = 36 MHz,
and an axial frequency νz = 1.3 MHz. If we set the
rotation frequency to ν = 1 MHz, the number den-
sity of a cloud of 105 207Pb81+ ions is 5 · 107 cm−3
(the Brillouin limit is 4.6 · 108 cm−3). Such an ion
cloud has a length of 6.8 mm and a diameter of
0.75 mm, which leads to an aspect ratio of 9.0. The
Debye length of this cloud is 250 nm. The depen-
dence of the ion cloud parameters on ν is shown in
ﬁgure 4.

A spectrum of the ground state hyperﬁne tran-
sition can be obtained by scanning the laser wave-
length across the resonance while recording the
ﬂuorescence from the trapped decaying HCI. Re-
peated measurements on a single cloud of ions can
be made, as detection is not destructive. To ob-
tain the highest spectral resolution, the laser beam
must be parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld (trap axis),
so as to avoid the large Doppler shift associated
with the global rotation of the ion cloud. Laser ex-
citation along the trap axis, on an ion cloud smaller
than the laser beam, will also help to ensure that
the transition is fully saturated.

4. Calculated expected signal rates

An ion temperature of 4 K corresponds to a
Doppler width of 30 MHz. For 207Pb81+ ions, the
wavelength of 1020 nm corresponds to an upper
state lifetime of 50 ms and a linewidth of 3 Hz.
The laser power to fully saturate the Doppler-
broadened transition is roughly 3 mW and is eas-
ily reached by e.g. a Ti:Sapphire or Ar+ pumped
dye laser. If the experiment is run in a continuous
mode, assuming an overall detection eﬃciency of
4 · 10−3, we expect to detect about 4 · 103 photon
emissions per second for a completely saturated
ion cloud. It should be possible to reduce the back-
ground signal to less than 102 counts per second,
yielding a typical S/N ratio of 40. Alternatively, if
the laser excitation is pulsed with a duty cycle of
200 ms (= 4τ ), the signal is about 103 counts per
second, without any background from scattered
laser light. These values are high enough to allow
easy detection and measurement of the transition
wavelength. Once the signal is seen, this will allow
a wavelength determination to an accuracy which
far exceeds the theoretical uncertainties. The
linewidth of e.g. a Ti:Sapphire laser is 1 MHz at a
wavelength of 1 µm, which is much smaller than
the Doppler broadening of 30 MHz. Therefore the
accuracy of the HFS measurement is estimated
to be about 10−7, which is 3 orders of magnitude
better than the current accuracy [5].

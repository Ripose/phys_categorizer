Stochastic dissociation of diatomic molecules

Anatole Kenfack∗ and Jan M. Rost

N¨othnitzer Strasse 38, 01187 Dresden, Germany.

The fragmentation of diatomic molecules under a stochastic force is investigated both classically
and quantum mechanically, focussing on their dissociation probabilities. It is found that the quan-
tum system is more robust than the classical one in the limit of a large number of kicks. The
opposite behavior emerges for a small number of kicks. Quantum and classical dissociation prob-
abilities do not coincide for any parameter combinations of the force. This can be attributed to a
scaling property in the classical system which is broken quantum mechanically.

INTRODUCTION

≥

The anharmonicity of molecular vibrations makes the
dissociation of a molecule by irradiation of laser light a
relatively diﬃcult task [1]. Consequently, high intensity
is required for dissociation, for instance, I > 1015W/cm2
1014W/cm2 for HCl. At such intensities,
for HF and I
however, the ionization process dominates and masks vi-
brational excitation and dissociation. Chelkowsky et al.
[2] suggested that the dissociation threshold of a diatomic
molecule can be lowered by two orders of magnitude using
a frequency chirped laser, and hence dissociation without
ionization should be possible. In a similar spirit, circu-
larly chirped pulses have been used by Kim et al.
[3]
for the dissociation of diatomic molecules. They found
that the threshold laser intensity is suﬃciently reduced,
to achieve dissociation without ionization.

Here, we investigate the possibility for dissociation of
diatomic molecules under a stochastic force, which could
eventually be chosen such that ionization is minimal.
A second motivation for our work is the question, if a
stochastic driving destroys quantum coherence and even-
tually brings the quantum and classical evolution close to
each other.

We model the force as a sequence of pulses (kicks)
at random times, each kick carrying an independent
weight [4]. This type of force, similar to white shot noise,
has been used to model the passage of ions through car-
bon foils before [5]. Its average strength γ and the aver-

system which is taken as a Morse oscillator [6] with pa-
rameters corresponding to Hydrogen Flouride (HF) and
Hydrogen Chloride (HCl) molecules. Classical and quan-
tum evolution of the system are conveniently compared
by using the Wigner transform of the initial wavefunc-
tion as initial phase space distribution in the classical
evolution.

with which we solve the stochastic dynamics, which is the
Langevin equation with test particle discretization and
Monte Carlo sampling in the classical case and the di-
rect solution of the stochastic Schr¨odinger equation with

We restrict our analysis to positive γi and assume that
γi and ti are mutually uncorrelated random variables gen-
erated by the distributions functions of Eq. (6). The
determination of F (t) reduces to the construction of a
stochastic sequence (γi, ti) which can be done assum-
ing that the random times ti form a Poisson sequence
of points leading to a delta correlated process [4]. It is
easy to show [8] that the constructed stochastic force has

These properties reveal the diﬀerence between the

III. DYNAMICS

A. Time evolution

Our system as described is non deterministic due to the
stochastic nature of its Hamiltonian, but closed. This is
consistent with a regime of high eﬀective temperature
and no dissipation. Speciﬁcally speaking, the system is a
simple anharmonic particle which is not coupled to any
environment (zero dissipation and no diﬀusion) but sub-
ject to an external force [9]. A perturbative solution for
this system is in general not possible, because the ﬁeld
strengths applied signiﬁcantly distort the system. We
are interested in formulation of the dynamics which is
applicable for the quantum as well as for the classical

treatment. This can be done in an elegant way by prop-
agating the Wigner transform W of the density matrix

Here, Lcl and Lq represent the classical and quantum

the molecule. Unfortunately, solving the master equation
and constructing ˆO is a complicated task. It is much eas-
ier to solve the equations of motion derived from Eq. (1)
directly.

Both formulations have in common that they must be

stochastic force. Only the average over all realizations
produces the solution of the Classical Langevin and the
stochastic Schr¨odinger equations, respectively.

The molecule is considered to be initially in the ground
vibrational state
with energy E0 (Eq. (3)). For
the classical propagation we take the Wigner distribution
of the ground state as initial phase space distribution.

In each Slm the initial conditions

physical result is obtained by averaging Eq. (18) over
the Nr realizations. For the results we will present we
chose Nr = 100 and Ntest = 1000 which was suﬃcient to
achieve convergence.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Quantum and classical dissociation probabilities

An overview over the results is given in Fig. 1. As a
general trend one sees that quantum and classical disso-
ciation probabilities do not coincide, in neither limit of
the stochastic force (small and large γ and
). Fur-
i
thermore, for all parameter combinations, the classical
dissociation takes oﬀ later but increases faster eventu-
ally overtaking the quantum dissociation and going into
saturation earlier than in the quantum case. The more
abrupt classical dissociation can be parameterized with

which ﬁts quite well the classical dissociation. The fact,
that the discrepancy between the quantum and the clas-
sical curves prevails even in the parameter limits for the
stochastic force, can be partially attributed to a scal-
ing invariance. This invariance with respect to the ra-
tio γ/
is obeyed by the classical dynamics
but not by the quantum dynamics. The scaling invari-
ance means that for equal average stochastic force
F (t)

(compare Eq. (7)), the classical dynamics is the same,
yet on diﬀerent eﬀective time scales. This can be seen by
transforming the dynamics to a dimensionless time vari-

While the classical dynamics gives qualitatively the
same picture as the quantum dynamics it does not ap-
proach the quantum result, not even in the limit of a large
number of kicks. This is diﬀerent from a Coulomb system
under stochastic driving [5]. Since it becomes classical
close to E = 0 (which corresponds formally to the disso-
ciation threshold here) one can show that the Coulomb
system itself behaves almost classical, and therefore the
classical scaling under the stochastic force also applies
to the quantum Coulomb system close to E = 0. The
molecular system behaves non-classically, even close to
the dissociation threshold, which prevents to approach

the classical scaling under the stochastic force. Interest-
ingly, the nature of stochastic driving, namely the cancel-
lation of interferences, does not help to approach classical
behavior. The reason is that the dynamics in the Morse
potential without stochastic force diﬀers classically and
quantum mechanically, particularly for higher energies,
where the non linearity of the potential is strong. Con-
sequently, one may ask if under a very strong stochastic
force, i. e. , without a potential, classical and quantum
dynamics become similar.

B. The free particle limit under stochastic driving

If V = 0 in Eq. (1), i. e. , H0 = p2/2m, one sees im-
mediately with the help of Ehrenfest’s theorem that clas-
sical and quantum observables should agree since Eq. (1)
only contains linear and quadratic operators. Therefore,

We may use this analytical expression Pd(t) with the two
parameters α, t0 to ﬁt and interpret the dissociation prob-
abilities in Fig. 1. At some time t0 > 0 after a number
of kicks the systems will have a distribution (with width
α) of energies and the mean energy may be considered to
be high enough to approximate the dynamics with a free
particle Hamiltonian under stochastic driving without a
potential. As one can see in Fig. 1, this approximation
becomes increasingly better for larger time in comparison
to the classical response, while the quantum response re-
mains diﬀerent. In Fig. 1-d Pd(t) is plotted for γ = 0.021,

We have proposed and discussed the possibility of dis-

problem has been explored as function of the characteris-
tic parameters of the stochastic force, namely the average

to dissociate the molecule with typical
much longer
than electronic time scales we expect the stochastic force
to be an eﬃcient way to dissociate a molecule. In con-
trast to Coulomb dynamics there is no parameter limit
of the stochastic force where classical and quantum re-
sults coincide. The reason is the classical scaling of the
dynamics under the stochastic force which is broken by
the quantum dynamics. We recall that the present sys-
tem is a closed one, not coupled to an environment and
therefore not subject to dissipation and diﬀusion. For the
latter case of an open system the classical-quantum cor-
respondence has been investigated systematically, with
the general tendency that strong decoherence makes the

i

quantum system to behave more classically. In contrast,
little is known about the quantum-classical correspon-
dence in the present case of a closed system exposed to
a stochastic force.

We hope that our results will stimulate eﬀorts to
achieve experimental dissociation of diatomic molecules
using white shot noise. Experiments, using a stochastic
force similar to the present one, have been successfully
performed by Raizen and cowerkers [14], on the dynamics
of rotors.

We have measured the parallel velocity distribution of
a lithium supersonic beam produced by seeding lithium in
argon. The parallel temperature for lithium is considerably
lower than the calculated parallel temperature of the argon
carrier gas. We have extended the theory of supersonic cool-
ing to calculate the parallel temperature of the seeded gas, in
the limit of high dilution. The theoretical result thus obtained
is in good agreement with our observations.

I. INTRODUCTION

We have observed an unexpected cooling eﬀect in an
argon supersonic beam seeded with a small amount of
lithium: the lithium parallel temperature is smaller than
the argon parallel temperature. This eﬀect is surprisingly
large, the lithium parallel temperature being 4 times
smaller than the calculated argon parallel temperature,
whereas the common assumption is that these two par-
allel temperatures are roughly equal.

Although surprising, this eﬀect can be explained by
an extension of the theory giving the terminal parallel
temperature in supersonic beams of pure gases. This
theory, ﬁrst developed by Anderson and Fenn in 1965
[1], has been completed by Toennies and Winkelmann
[2] in 1977 and Beijerinck and Verster [3] in 1981 (for a
brief review, see ref. [2]). In his 1988 review on free jet
sources, D.R. Miller [4] discusses the case of expansion
of binary mixtures: this case has been studied by various
authors but their results, which are most accurate for a
dilute heavy species, do not predict a large temperature
diﬀerence in our case.

The basic phenomenon is due to the exchange of energy
between the alkali atoms and the rare gas atoms. Two
eﬀects are important:
i) the alkali-rare gas interaction
has a longer range than the rare gas-rare gas interactions
so that the expansion cooling goes on for a longer time
for the alkali atoms; ii) the mass ratio plays an important
role in the energy exchange between the two species and,
as shown below, the parallel temperature of the seeded
gas (mass m2) is considerably lower than the parallel
temperature of the carrier gas (mass m1) when m2 ≪ m1
In this paper, we ﬁrst describe our measurement of the
parallel temperature of lithium seeded in argon. Then,
we recall the theory explaining the ﬁnal temperature in
supersonic beams and we describe its extension to the
case of a gas mixture in the limit of a high dilution. We
thus get diﬀerential equations coupling the parallel and

perpendicular temperatures of the seeded gas to the same
quantities of the carrier gas. Finally, we compare our
theoretical result to our experiment as well as to another
evidence of this anomalous cooling eﬀect.

II. OUR MEASUREMENT

We have measured the parallel temperature of our
lithium beam by laser induced ﬂuorescence. The ﬂuo-
rescence of the 7Li isotope (92.5% natural abundance)
is excited by a single frequency laser operating at 671
nm, using the 2S1/2 −2 P3/2 resonance transition. Two
laser beams are used, one near normal incidence measures
the transverse velocity distribution, while the other one,
working with an incidence close to 45◦ is sensitive to a
combination of the parallel and perpendicular velocity
distributions. We use a low laser power density in order
to prevent any saturation broadening. Figure 1 presents
a typical spectrum of the ﬂuorescence as a function of the
laser frequency. Each laser beam excites two resonance
lines corresponding to the two hyperﬁne levels F = 1 and
F = 2 of the 2S1/2 ground state, with an hyperﬁne split-
ting equal to 803.5 MHz, while the very small hyperﬁne
structure of the 2P3/2 excited state cannot be resolved
[5].

The distance between the lines corresponding to the
same transition excited by the two laser beams gives
access to the mean velocity of the beam, while the
linewidths give access to the widths of the velocity dis-
tributions. The observed perpendicular velocity distri-
bution depends on the width of the observed part of the
lithium beam and our observation corresponds to a per-
pendicular temperature of 0.4 K. As expected, the paral-
lel velocity distribution is broader than the perpendicular
velocity distribution (in our excitation geometry with a
45◦ incidence, the Doppler width is only 0.71 times the
width we would get if the laser and atomic beams were
parallel). The measured parallel temperature is Tk = 6.6
K, while the calculated parallel temperature of our argon
beam is 26 K.

m1 is the atomic mass. We use local cartesian coordi-

theoretical treatment of Toennies and Winkelmann [2]
(noted below TW) and the one of Beijerinck and Ver-
ster [3] (noted below BV) are diﬀerent but equations

call that the collision considered here involve two atoms
of species 1. ∆E is the energy transferred during one
collision from the parallel degree of freedom to the per-
pendicular ones; after averaging over the azimuth of the
ﬁnal relative velocity around the initial relative velocity,
∆E is given by :

potential with a C6(1, 1) long-range coeﬃcient and if the
relative kinetic energy is small with respect to the in-
teraction potential well depth ǫ, the Ω(2,2)

ential equations (2) can be integrated numerically, thus

of A and α are A = 1.413 and α = 0.53 obtained by
TW [2], A = 1.313 and α = 0.545 obtained by BV [3],
A = 1.40 and α = 0.495 obtained also by BV from a ﬁt
of experimental Sk∞ values for argon expansions.

IV. GENERALIZATION TO THE CASE OF A
MIXTURE OF TWO MONOATOMIC GASES

Our calculation is made in the case of a high dilu-
tion, i.e. when the seeded gas density n2 is considerably
smaller than the carrier gas density n1. We neglect the
velocity slip i.e. we assume the same hydrodynamic ve-
locity u for both species. Because n2 ≪ n1, the expan-
sion of the carrier gas is not modiﬁed by the presence of
the seeded gas and the equations written above remain
valid. For the seeded gas, we write similar equations,
considering only the collisions with atoms of the carrier
gas. This calculation is not detailed here because it is
more complex. In order to linearize the equations, we m
have remarked that the products gQ(l)
1,2(g) ∝ g1/3 vary
slowly with g and we have treated these quantities as
constant. Then, with some further approximations, we
get the diﬀerential equations relating Tk2 and T⊥2:

ﬂection function for a 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential (see
appendix A of [3]), we have calculated ρo = 1.32.

1,2/Q(2)

Following BV, we have introduced reduced tempera-
tures and a reduced z-coordinate. Then, the numerical
integration of the coupled equations gives the tempera-
tures represented in ﬁgure 2. At the end of the expan-
sion, the parallel and perpendicular temperatures of the
seeded gas are lower than the similar quantities for the
carrier gas. The parallel temperature ratio Tk2/Tk1 can
be substantially lower than 1. The minimum value for
temperature Tk2 is reached when the right-hand side of
equation (9) vanishes. Neglecting the perpendicular tem-
peratures, we thus get:

Tk2,min

(12)

This limiting value is reached if the number of 1 − 2
collisions is suﬃciently larger than the number of 1 − 1
collisions, i.e.
if the ratio ρs is large enough. We have
plotted in ﬁgure 3 the terminal value of the ratio Tk2/Tk1
for various values of the ratio ρs and for diﬀerent values
of the mass ratio m2/m1.

V. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS

We may now compare our theoretical and experimen-
tal results for lithium seeded in argon. In our experiment
with p0 = 333 millibar, T0 = 943 K and a nozzle diam-
eter d = 200 µm, the parallel temperature of lithium is
Tk2∞ = 6.6 K. Using equation (8) with A = 1.40 and
α = 0.495 [3], we deduce the argon parallel temperature
from our source conditions Tk1∞ = 26 K. The calculated
temperature may be overestimated, because the true col-
lision cross-section is underestimated [4] by equation (7)
when the source temperature is comparable to or larger
than the argon-argon well depth ǫ/kB ≈ 143 K [7,8].
However, as we are using an empirical law based on ex-
periments with source temperatures of 288 K and 380
K, we think that the overestimation of the argon paral-
lel temperature should not be very large. We thus get a
parallel temperature ratio Tk2∞/Tk1∞ = 0.25. This value
is larger than the limiting ratio to Tk2,min/Tk1∞ = 0.16
for lithium in argon and it is smaller than our theoret-
ical result Tk2∞/Tk1∞ = 0.31 obtained with ρs = 2.55
deduced from the C6 values of argon-argon and lithium-
argon interaction [9]. The diﬀerence between theory and
experiment may be due partly to the overestimation of
the argon parallel temperature discussed above, partly to
the approximations done in our theory.

3

A similar beam with sodium seeded in argon was built
by D. Pritchard and coworkers [10,11] with a source tem-
perature close to T0 = 1000 K, an argon pressure up
to p0 = 2000 Torr and a nozzle diameter d = 70 µm.
The measured velocity u = 1040 ± 2 m/s corresponds
to T0 = 1039 K and the rms velocity width, deduced
from the atomic diﬀraction pattern, was found equal to
3.7 ± 0.4% , corresponding to Tk2∞ = 4.1 ± 0.9 K. From
the calculated argon parallel temperature Tk1 = 14 K at
the largest pressure, we get the parallel temperature ra-
tio Tk2∞/Tk1∞ = 0.29 ± 0.06, very close to the limiting
ratio Tk2,min/Tk1∞ = 0.30 for this mass ratio. Using the
C6 value of sodium-argon interaction from reference [9]
(ρs = 1.67), our theoretical result is Tk2∞/Tk1∞ = 0.61,
substantially larger than the experimental value. A part
of this diﬀerence can be explained as in the lithium case
but some other eﬀect is probably involved.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this letter, we have described a measurement of
the parallel velocity distribution of a supersonic beam
of lithium seeded in argon, with a high dilution. The
measured lithium parallel temperature 6.6 K is consid-
erably lower than the calculated parallel temperature of
the argon beam near 26 K.

We have extended the theory of the velocity distribu-
tion in supersonic beams to a mixture of monoatomic
gases, in the high dilution limit. We have established
diﬀerential equations describing the parallel and perpen-
dicular temperatures of the seeded gas; these equations
explain the observed eﬀect as a consequence of several
circumstances: role of the mass ratio in energy exchange
during collisions of the two species, longer range of the
lithium-argon interaction as compared to argon-argon in-
teraction. We have deduced the lowest possible value of
the temperature ratio Tk2∞/Tk1∞. This ratio may be
quite low when a light species is seeded in a heavy species
with m2 ≪ m1.

Comparison of this theory with our experimental re-
sults is satisfactory and we have also found evidence of
the same eﬀect in data published by D. Pritchard and
coworkers on a sodium beam seeded in argon. In both
cases, the ratio of the measured alkali parallel tempera-
ture to the calculated argon parallel temperature is lower
than what our theory predicts. This discrepancy may
be partly due to an overestimation of the terminal ar-
gon parallel temperatures and we have good reasons to
think that such an overestimation may result from our
use of Beijerinck and Verster semi-empirical formula in
the range of high source temperature where it has not
been tested. This discrepancy may also be due to the
approximations we have made in our calculation of the
parallel temperature of the seeded gas and we are going to
test these approximations by more detailed calculations.

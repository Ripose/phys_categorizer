Abstract. A novel method for calculating resonances in three-body Coulom-
bic systems is presented. The Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations are solved
by applying the Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion method. To show the
power of the method we calculate resonances of the three-α and the H −
sys-
tems.

1 Introduction

For three-body systems the Faddeev equations are the fundamental equations.
After one iteration they possess connected kernels, consequently they are eﬀec-
tively Fredholm integral equations of second kind. Thus the Fredholm alterna-
tive applies: at certain energy either the homogeneous or the inhomogeneous
equations have solutions. Three-body bound states correspond to the solutions
of the homogeneous Faddeev equations at real energies, resonances, as usual in
quantum mechanics, are related to their complex-energy solutions.

The Faddeev equations were derived for short-range interactions and if we
simply plug-in a Coulomb-like potential they become singular. The necessary
modiﬁcations have been formulated in the Faddeev-Merkuriev theory [1] on a
mathematically sound and elegant way via integral equations with connected

2

(compact) kernels and conﬁguration space diﬀerential equations with asymp-
totic boundary conditions.

Recently, one of us has developed a novel method for treating the three-
body Coulomb problem via solving the set of Faddeev-Noble and Lippmann-
Schwinger integral equations in Coulomb–Sturmian-space representation. The
method was elaborated ﬁrst for bound-state problems [2] with repulsive
Coulomb plus nuclear potential, then it was extended for calculating p − d
scattering at energies below the breakup threshold [3]. Also atomic bound-
state problems with attractive Coulomb interactions were considered [4]. In
these calculations an excellent agreement with the results of other well estab-
lished methods were found and the eﬃciency and the accuracy of the method
were demonstrated.

More recently we have extended the method for calculating resonances in
three-body systems with short-range plus repulsive Coulomb interactions by
solving the Faddeev-Noble integral equations [5]. Here we solve the Faddeev-
Merkuriev integral equations. This way we can handle all kind of Coulomb-like
potentials, not only repulsive but also attractive ones. For illustrating the power
of this method we show our previous three-α results and, as novel feature, we
calculate resonances in the H − (pee) system.

2 Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations

The Hamiltonian of a three-body Coulombic system reads

H = H 0 + W + vα + vβ + vγ,

(1)

where H 0 is the three-body kinetic energy operator, W stands for the possible
three-body potential and vα denotes the Coulomb-like interaction in the sub-
system α. We use throughout the usual conﬁguration-space Jacobi coordinates
xα and yα. Thus vα only depends on xα (vα = vα(xα)), while W depends on
both xα and yα coordinates (W = W (xα, yα)).

The physical role of a Coulomb-like potential is twofold. Its long-distance
part modiﬁes the asymptotic motion, while its short-range part strongly corre-
lates the two-body subsystems. Merkuriev proposed to split the potentials into
short-range and long-range parts in the three-body conﬁguration space via a
cut-oﬀ function ζ,

v(s)
α (xα, yα) = vα(xα)ζα(xα, yα),

(2)

and

v(l)
α (xα, yα) = vα(xα)[1 − ζα(xα, yα)].
The function ζα is deﬁned such that it separates the asymptotic two-body sector
Ωα from the rest of the three-body conﬁguration space. On the region of Ωα
the splitting function ζα asymptotically tends to 1 and on the complementary
asymptotic region of the conﬁguration space it tends to 0. Rigorously, Ωα is
deﬁned as a part of the three-body conﬁguration space where the condition

(3)

|xα| < x0(1 + |yα|/y0)1/ν , with x0 > 0, y0 > 0, ν > 2,

(4)

3

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

is satisﬁed. So, in Ωα the short-range part v(s)
coincides with the original
α
Coulomb-like potential vα and in the complementary region vanishes, whereas
the opposite holds true for v(l)
α . Note that for repulsive Coulomb interactions
one can also adopt Noble’s approach [6], where the splitting is performed in the
two-body conﬁguration space. This approach can be considered as the y0 → ∞
limit of Merkuriev’s splitting. Then v(l)
α coincides with the whole Coulomb
interaction and v(s)

α with the short-range nuclear potential.

In the Faddeev procedure we split the wave function into three components

where the components are deﬁned by

|Ψ i = |ψαi + |ψβi + |ψαi,

|ψαi = G(l)(z)v(s)

α |Ψ i.

Here G(l) is the resolvent of the long-ranged Hamiltonian

H (l) = H 0 + W + v(l)

α + v(l)

β + v(l)
γ ,

G(l)(z) = (z − H (l))−1, and z is the complex energy parameter. The wave-
function components satisfy the homogeneous Faddeev-Merkuriev integral
equations

|ψαi = G(l)

α (z)v(s)

H (l)

α = H (l) + v(s)
α ,

α (z) = (z − H (l)

G(l)
α )−1. Merkuriev has proved that Eqs. (8) possess compact
kernels for positive E energies, and this property remains valid also for complex
energies z = E − iΓ/2, Γ > 0.

3 Solution method

We solve these integral equations by using the Coulomb–Sturmian separable
expansion approach. The Coulomb-Sturmian (CS) functions are deﬁned by

hr|ni =

1/2

n!
(n + 2l + 1)! (cid:21)

(cid:20)

(2br)l+1 exp(−br)L2l+1

(2br),

n

(10)

with n and l being the radial and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers,
respectively, and b is the size parameter of the basis. The CS functions {|ni}
form a biorthonormal discrete basis in the radial two-body Hilbert space; the
ni = r−1hr|ni. Since the three-body Hilbert
biorthogonal partner deﬁned by hr|
space is a direct product of two-body Hilbert spaces an appropriate basis can

e

4

be deﬁned as the angular momentum coupled direct product of the two-body
bases (the possible other quantum numbers are implicitly assumed)

|nνiα = |niα ⊗ |νiα,

(n, ν = 0, 1, 2, . . .).

(11)

With this basis the completeness relation takes the form

Note that in the three-body Hilbert space, three equivalent bases belonging to

square integrable property of the term v(s)
α |ψγi, γ 6= α. Thus this approxima-
tion is justiﬁed also for complex energies as long as this property remains valid.
In Eq. (14) the ket and bra states are deﬁned for diﬀerent fragmentation, de-
pending on the environment of the potential operators in the equations. Now,
with this approximation, the solution of the homogeneous Faddeev-Merkuriev
equations turns into solution of matrix equations for the component vector

(15)

(16)

The Green’s operator G(l)
α is a solution of the auxiliary three-body prob-
lem with the Hamiltonian H (l)
α . To determine it uniquely one should start again
from Faddeev-type integral equations, which does not seem to lead any further,
or from the triad of Lippmann-Schwinger equations [7]. The triad of Lippmann-
Schwinger equations, although they do not possess compact kernels, also deﬁne
the solution in an unique way. They are, in fact, related to the adjoint repre-
sentation of the Faddeev operator [8]. The Hamiltonian H (l)
α , however, has a

5

(17)

(18)

peculiar property that it supports bound state only in the subsystem α, and
thus it has only one kind of asymptotic channel, the α channel. For such a sys-
tem one single Lippmann-Schwinger equation is suﬃcient for an unique solution
[9].

The appropriate equation takes the form

G(l)

α =

Gα +

GαU αG(l)
α ,

where

e
Gα is the resolvent of the channel-distorted long-range Hamiltonian,

e

e

Hα = H 0 + vα + u(l)
α ,

e
γ − u(l)

β + v(l)

α . The auxiliary potential u(l)

and U α = W + v(l)
coordinate yα and has the asymptotic form u(l)
α ∼ eα(eβ + eγ)/yα as yα → ∞.
In fact, u(l)
α is an eﬀective Coulomb interaction between the center of mass of
the subsystem α (with charge eβ + eγ) and the third particle (with charge eα).
Its role is to compensate the Coulomb tail of the potentials v(l)

α depends on the

in Ωα.

β + v(l)

γ

It is important to realize that in this approach to get the solution only the
matrix elements G(l)
α are needed, i.e. only the representation of the Green’s
operator on a compact subset of the Hilbert space are required. So, although
Eq. (17) does not possess a compact kernel on the whole three-body Hilbert
space its matrix form is eﬀectively a compact equation on the subspace spanned
by ﬁnite number of CS functions. Thus we can perform an approximation,
similar to Eq. (14), on the potential U α in Eq. (17), with bases of the same
fragmentation α applied on both sides of the operator. Now the integral equa-
tion reduces to an analogous set of linear algebraic equation with the operators
replaced by their matrix representations. The solution is given by

[G(l)

α (z)]−1 = [

Gα(z)]−1 − U α.

The most crucial point in this procedure is the calculation of the matrix

Gα is a resolvent of the sum of
of Jacobi coordinates. The Green’s operator
xα + vα and
two commuting Hamiltonians,

α , which act in diﬀerent two-body Hilbert spaces. Thus, us-
ing the convolution theorem the three-body Green’s operator
Gα equates to a
convolution integral of two-body Green’s operators, i.e.

Hα = hxα + hyα, where hxα = h0

(20)

where gxα(z) = (z − hxα)−1 and gyα(z) = (z − hyα)−1. The contour C should
be taken counterclockwise around the continuous spectrum of hyα so that gxα
is analytic in the domain encircled by C.

To examine the structure of the integrand let us shift the spectrum of gxα
by taking z = E + iε with positive ε. By doing so, the two spectra become

6

well separated and the spectrum of gyα can be encircled. Next the contour C
is deformed analytically in such a way that the upper part descends to the
unphysical Riemann sheet of gyα, while the lower part of C can be detoured
away from the cut [see Fig. 1]. The contour still encircles the branch cut sin-
gularity of gyα, but in the ε → 0 limit it now avoids the singularities of gxα.
Moreover, by continuing to negative values of ε, in order that we can calculate
resonances, the branch cut and pole singularities of gxα move onto the second
Riemann sheet of gyα and, at the same time, the branch cut of gyα moves onto
the second Riemann sheet of gxα. Thus, the mathematical conditions for the
contour integral representation of
Gα(z) in Eq. (20) can be fulﬁlled also for
complex energies with negative imaginary part. In this respect there is only a
gradual diﬀerence between the bound- and resonant-state calculations. Now,
the matrix elements

Gα can be cast in the form

Gα(z) =

(21)

where the corresponding CS matrix elements of the two-body Green’s operators
in the integrand are known analytically for all complex energies [10], and thus
the convolution integral can be performed also in practice.

4 Numerical illustration

4.1 Resonances in a model three-alpha system

To show the power of this method we examine the convergence of the results
for three-body resonant-state energies. For this purpose we take ﬁrst the same
model that has been presented by us before in Ref. [5]. This is an Ali–Bodmer-
type model for the charged three-α system interacting via s-wave short-range
interaction. To improve its properties we add a phenomenological three-body
potential. Adopting Noble’s splitting we have

v(s)
α (r) = V1 exp{−r2/β1

2} + V2 exp{−r2/β2

2}

with V1 = 125 MeV, V2 = −30.18 MeV, β1 = 1.53 fm, β2 = 2.85 fm, and

α (r) = 4e2/r.
v(l)

We use units such that ~2/m = 41.47 MeV, e2 = 1.44 MeV fm. The mass of the
α-particle is chosen as M = 3.973m, where m denotes the mass of the nucleon.
The three body potential is taken to have Gaussian form

W (ρ) = V exp{−ρ2/β2},

3

where ρ2 =

r2
i , V = −31.935 MeV and β = 3.315 fm. Here ri stands for the
position vector of i-th particle in the center of mass frame of the three-α system.
Since we consider here three identical particles we can reduce the necessary

Pi=1

(22)

(23)

(24)

7

Faddeev components to one. We select states with total angular momentum
L = 0. In Table 1 we show the convergence of the energy of the ground state
and of the ﬁrst resonant state with respect to N , the number of CS functions
employed in the expansion. The selected resonance is the experimentally well-
known sharp state which has a great relevance in nuclear synthesis.

4.2 The H − system

In this system all the two-body interactions are of pure Coulomb type, two of
them are attractive, therefore we have to use the genuine Merkuriev approach.
Since the two electrons are identical particles we can reduce the number of
Faddeev components to two. Furthermore, we can deﬁne the cutoﬀ function
such that v(s)
ee ≡ 0. In this case the corresponding Faddeev component vanishes
identically. So, ﬁnally we have to deal with one Faddeev component only. In
the pe subsystem we take the Merkuriev’s cut with the functional form

ζ(x, y) = 2/(1 + exp((x/x0)ν /(1 + y/y0))),

(25)

and with the actual parameters are ν = 2.1, x0 = 5 and y0 = 10. Fig. 2 and 3
show the short and long range parts of vpe, respectively. In Table 2 we present
the convergence of the energy of a L = 0 resonant state with respect to N and
the number of angular momentum channels used in the bipolar expansion.

5 Conclusions

In this article we have presented a new method for calculating resonances in
three-body Coulombic systems. The homogeneous Faddeev-Merkuriev integral
equations were solved for complex energies. For this, being an integral equation
approach, no boundary conditions are needed. We solve the integral equations
by using the Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion technique. The method
works equally for three-body systems with repulsive and attractive Coulomb
interactions.

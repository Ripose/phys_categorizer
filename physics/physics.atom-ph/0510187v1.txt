The interaction of atomic clusters with short, intense pulses of laser light to form extremely
hot, dense plasmas has attracted extensive experimental and theoretical interest. The high density
of atoms within the cluster greatly enhances the atom–laser interaction, while the ﬁnite size of
the cluster prevents energy from escaping the interaction region. Recent technological advances
have allowed experiments to probe the laser–cluster interaction at very high photon energies, with
interactions much stronger than suggested by theories for lower photon energies. We present a
model of the laser–cluster interaction which uses non-perturbative R-matrix techniques to calculate
inverse bremsstrahlung and photoionization cross sections for Herman-Skillman atomic potentials.
We describe the evolution of the cluster under the inﬂuence of the processes of inverse bremsstrahlung
heating, photoionization, collisional ionization and recombination, and expansion of the cluster. We
compare charge state distribution, charge state ejection energies, and total energy absorbed with
the Hamburg experiment of Wabnitz et al. [Nature 420, 482 (2002)] and ejected electron spectra
with Laarmann et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 063402 (2005)].

INTRODUCTION

tons.

At suﬃciently low temperatures and suﬃciently high
density, atoms and molecules in the gas phase begin to
form bound systems, or clusters [1, 2]. Some clusters con-
sist of only a few monomers; others contain many millions
of atoms or molecules. In this sense, clusters, which are
typical nanomaterials, represent a natural link between
simple atoms and condensed matter. However, they do
not simply mimic the properties of their constituents nor
of the bulk they converge to. Clusters are unique. This
is highlighted, for example, by their interaction with in-
tense electromagnetic radiation.

The majority of corresponding experiments were car-
ried out using laser pulses in the near-infrared, with pho-
ton energies of about 1 eV and pulse durations on the
order of 100 fs [3]. At pulse intensities of 1016 W/cm2
or higher, noble gas clusters consisting of krypton or ar-
gon atoms absorb the laser pulse energy extremely eﬃ-
ciently. They are turned into nanoplasmas accompanied
by high ionic charge states and strong x-ray emission [4].
In xenon clusters, the production of extremely hot (keV)
electrons was observed [5]. The hot nanoplasmas un-
dergo complete fragmentation. The associated dynamics
was studied, for Ar and Xe clusters, by Lezius et al. [6]:
Ions with kinetic energies of up to 1 MeV are ejected
from the expanding clusters.

The high density of atoms in the cluster greatly
enhances the atom–laser interaction over that of lone
atoms, while the ﬁnite size of the clusters ensures that
energy absorbed by the cluster is largely constrained to
stay within the interaction region, not carried oﬀ by a
large heat bath, as occurs with materials in bulk. These
properties in combination allow the laser–cluster interac-
tion to create extremely hot, dense plasmas, which may
in turn serve as sources for high-energy particles or pho-

Several groups performed extensive numerical simula-
tions with the purpose of identifying the relevant heat-
ing mechanisms. Ditmire et al.
[7] pointed out that
collisional heating dominates. More precisely, the ion-
ized electrons inside the cluster are quasifree but can ab-
sorb photons whenever they are being scattered by ions.
This process is referred to as inverse bremsstrahlung [8].
Inelastic electron–ion collisions of the (e, 2e) type con-
tribute to the high ionic charge states observed. Other
authors [9, 10, 11] lay their focus on the interplay be-
tween the strong quasistatic electric ﬁeld of the laser and
the Coulomb ﬁeld of neighboring ions. This interplay
can lead to enhanced ionization, as ﬁrst discovered in di-
atomic molecules [12, 13]. The relative importance of
enhanced ionization is somewhat diﬃcult to assess, since
in Refs. [9, 10, 11] collisional heating was not considered
and no comparison was provided between the simulations
and available experimental data.

Little is known about laser–cluster interactions at uv or
higher photon energies. The destructive impact of laser
pulses with a peak intensity of almost 1019 W/cm2 at a
wavelength of 248 nm was demonstrated by McPherson
et al.
[14]. However, intense laser ﬁelds at even higher
photon energies have not been accessible until very re-
cently. In 2000, the ﬁrst lasing—in a free-electron laser
(FEL)—at λ = 109 nm was reported [15]. The FEL is
part of the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) in Hamburg, Ger-
many. (One of the major objectives of the TTF is the
development of the technology for an ultrabright x-ray
laser.) The new vuv laser source has already displayed
its capability for exploring interesting physics: Motivated
by the outstanding properties of the radiation generated
by the TTF FEL, documented in Ref. [16], experiments
were performed [17] in which Van der Waals clusters of
xenon atoms were exposed to 12.7-eV vuv photons, an

energy range which had been previously unexplored.

Each pulse in the experiment lasted about 100 fs.

The highest intensity in the experiment was about 7
×
1013 W/cm2. Under these conditions, isolated Xe atoms
were found to produce only singly charged ions (see
Refs. [18] and [19] for recent developments).
In large
clusters, however, each atom was found to absorb up to
400 eV, corresponding to 30 photons, and charge states
of up to 8 plus were detected.

These results were very surprising. The dominant pro-
cesses in most models of infrared laser–cluster interac-
tions are ﬁeld ionization of atoms by the strong electric
ﬁeld of the laser, and heating of the cluster through in-
elastic dephasing collisions by electrons oscillating in the
laser electric ﬁeld. Both of these processes are strongly
inhibited by the high frequency of the vuv photons. A
relevant quantity in this context is the ponderomotive
potential [20] of an electron oscillating in a laser ﬁeld.
1013 W/cm2, the ponderomo-
At a laser intensity of 7
tive potential is only 62 meV, which is smaller than the
ionization potential of atomic xenon (12.1 eV [21]) by
three orders of magnitude.

×

In a previous Letter, two of us [22] proposed that the
additional heating was due to the eﬀects of atomic struc-
ture on the inverse bremsstrahlung rates. However, that
initial study calculated the inverse bremsstrahlung rates
using perturbation theory for both the electron–photon
interaction and the electron–ion interaction. The method
implemented for this paper instead treats the electron–
ion interaction nonperturbatively using variational R-
matrix methods, while retaining ﬁrst-order perturbation
theory for the electron–photon interaction. The result-
ing photoionization and inverse bremsstrahlung cross sec-
tions calculated are expected to be more realistic, even
though our description remains at the independent elec-
tron level.

In this paper, we present a model of the laser–cluster
interaction that takes atomic structure and the eﬀects
of plasma screening into account more fully than pre-
vious approaches to the subject. Considering the lim-
itations of the model and the poor experimental char-
acterization of the FEL radiation [23], we achieve good
agreement with the Hamburg results. We track photoion-
ization, collisional ionization and recombination, inverse
bremsstrahlung heating, evaporation of electrons from
the cluster, and expansion of the cluster due to hydrody-
namic pressure of hot electrons and Coulomb repulsion
through the duration of the laser pulse and, later, as the
cluster undergoes a Coulomb explosion.

Atomic units are used throughout, unless otherwise

noted.

A novel feature of the Hamburg Experiment is that
the 12.7-eV photons are suﬃcient to overcome the 12.1-
eV ionization potential of neutral xenon. Therefore, al-
though the oscillating electric ﬁeld is too weak for the
xenon atoms to undergo ﬁeld ionization, as occurs in the
ir domain, there is still an eﬃcient optical process for
creating Xe+.

The radial integrals IR(li, lf ) [Eq. (3)] were calculated
in the acceleration representation, using wave functions
generated in a variational eigenchannel R-matrix calcula-
tion [27], using a B-spline basis set to describe electrons
that experience a Hartree-Slater atomic potential. This
potential, which was calculated employing the program
by Herman and Skillman [28], is spherically symmetric.
Its eigenstates may therefore be chosen as eigenstates of
orbital angular momentum.

As a consequence of eﬃcient photoionization, the elec-
trons and ions inside the cluster form a dense, nanoscale-
size plasma already at an early stage of the laser pulse.
This plasma has the eﬀect of screening the atomic poten-
tial from both bound and continuum electrons. This low-
ers the ionization potential and changes both the initial-
and ﬁnal-state electron wave functions. Because of this,
cross sections for photoionization become larger as the
screening length in the plasma becomes shorter. With
suﬃcient screening, it becomes possible for ions to un-
dergo additional photoionization.

−

To account for this process, the screened radial ma-
trix elements were calculated using the same R-matrix
methods as for isolated Xe atoms. However, before the
initial- and ﬁnal-state wave functions were calculated,
the Herman-Skillman potential was multiplied by a De-
r/λD). (The electron Debye

ments and the corresponding photoionization potentials
were then spline-interpolated in the process of calculat-
ing the photoionization cross section at a given screening
length. For most of this paper, this screening length was
restricted to be no less than the Wigner-Seitz radius of
xenon at liquid density, 4.64 bohr. A discussion of shorter
screening lengths is given in a later section.

A second eﬀect of having a high density of

free
electrons in the cluster plasma is that these electrons
can themselves undergo both stimulated and inverse
bremsstrahlung, creating a second mechanism through
which laser energy can be deposited into the cluster.
Stimulated (inverse) bremsstrahlung refers to photon
emission into (absorption from) the laser mode by an
electron colliding with an ion in the plasma.

We treat the collisions of an electron with the clus-
ter ions as independent events in both time and space.
This allows us to focus on a single collision of an electron
with a single ion embedded in the plasma. The cross sec-
tion per unit energy for a free-free transition from initial
can be shown, using

As with photoionization cross sections, radial wave
functions were calculated using a nonperturbative eigen-
channel R-matrix approach. Matrix elements between
the energy-normalized wave functions were then calcu-
lated in the acceleration gauge, where the 1/r2 long-range
dependence of ∂V /∂z ensures that the radial integral will
converge, although the continuum electron wave func-
tions are not spatially normalizable.

Although microscopic reversibility ensures that ab-
sorption and emission cross sections coincide, stimulated
free-free transitions act as a powerful heating process be-
cause lower energy states are more highly populated than
higher energy states in a thermal distribution. Heating
rates can then be calculated for any given electron dis-
tribution. In this study, we assume that after each pho-
ton absorption or emission event the electron gas reequi-
librates rapidly as a consequence of frequent electron–
electron collisions. Thus, the electron probability distri-
bution ρ(E) may be written at all times during the laser
pulse as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:

ρ(E) = 2

The cross section deﬁned in Eq. (9) describes a free-

states. We therefore introduce ρ(E, l, m), which is the

probability per unit energy to ﬁnd an electron in the

state
wave function is normalized within a large sphere of ra-
dius R (not to be confused with the cluster radius), then
the largest l that contributes to this sum at a given ki-
netic energy E is lmax = R√2E [30]. Since, in thermal
equilibrium, ρ(E, l, m) can depend only on E, we see that

a rate equation for the electron temperature, expressed
in terms of the cross sections for stimulated and inverse
bremsstrahlung [Eq. (9)]. When writing down the equa-
tion for the time evolution of ρ(E, l, m), we must take
into consideration that ρ(E, l, m) refers to (spherical) box
normalization, while the cross section per unit energy in
Eq. (9) is based on energy-normalized wave functions.
For the sake of consistency, it is necessary to change
the initial state in the free-free radiative transition in
Eq. (9) from energy normalization to box normalization.
This has the eﬀect of multiplying the cross section by
π√2E/R.

Hence, in the presence of Na atomic scatterers (within
the normalization volume) and a laser beam of intensity

An electron state with energy E, then, communicates

with states of energy E
densely populated than itself. Since the absorption- and
emission cross sections are equal, this tends to populate
the state of energy E and depopulate the states of energy
ω, resulting in a net heating process. The state will

also communicate with states of energy E + ω, which are
less densely populated than itself, thereby again tending
to populate the higher-energy states while depopulating
the lower-energy state.

tion. In Fig. 1, as the scattering electron collides with
the ion at higher and higher initial energies, it probes
regions of the ionic potential at which the ion nucleus is
screened increasingly poorly by inner-shell electrons. As
a result, the inverse bremsstrahlung cross section rises
to many hundreds of times that of the naked Coulomb
potential.

FIG. 1: Inverse bremsstrahlung cross sections [Eqs. 14 and
15] for an electron with incident energy E to absorb a 12.7-
eV photon are given for an electron in the ﬁeld of a purely
Coulombic 1+ potential and for an electron in the ﬁeld
of a Xe Herman-Skillman atomic potential. The eﬀects of
atomic structure on inverse bremsstrahlung rates are quite
pronounced.

FIG. 2: The inverse bremsstrahlung cross section as a func-
tion of energy is shown for an electron in the ﬁeld of a
Debye-screened Xe Herman-Skillman potential, with the De-
bye screening length λD ranging from 1 a.u. to 20 a.u. As
λD grows, the cross section approaches the limit of no plasma
screening, shown in this graph by the dotted line. As the
Debye length of the cluster plasma shrinks, the charged ion
is shielded more eﬀectively from the scattering electron, and
the inverse bremsstrahlung cross section is decreased.

Adding plasma screening to this picture has the eﬀect
of supplementing the screening eﬀects of inner-shell elec-
trons with the screening eﬀects of plasma electrons. As a
result, the scattering electron feels the eﬀects of the ionic
nucleus more strongly than in the pure Coulomb case,
but less strongly than in the case of the unscreened ionic
potential. This is seen in a steady decrease of the inverse
bremsstrahlung cross section as the screening range de-
creases.

IV. COLLISIONAL IONIZATION AND
RECOMBINATION

Although photoionization and inverse bremsstrahlung
are the only processes by which the the cluster can absorb
photons from the laser beam, they are not by themselves
suﬃcient to explain the cluster’s evolution. As the pulse
progresses, large numbers of free electrons ﬁll the cluster.
These electrons can liberate other electrons via collisional
ionization if they have suﬃcient energy, or they can un-
dergo three-body recombination with an ion.

Including the eﬀects of ionization and recombination,
the rate equation for the number per unit volume ni of
charge species i is given by

These rate equations, along with equations for the en-
ergy in the free electron gas and the radius of the clus-
ter are integrated numerically through the duration of
the pulse. As a general rule, this set of equations will
be quite stiﬀ. We performed this integration using the
Rosenbrock method [31].

There are two requirements for a satisfactory treat-
ment of collisional ionization and recombination in the
cluster. First, both processes must occur at appropriate
rates, and second, the rates for ionization and recom-
bination must be consistent with one another, in that
they drive the cluster towards chemical equilibrium at all
times. The second requirement is particularly signiﬁcant
because the usual treatment of collisional ionization (also
used in this study) uses the semiempirical Lotz formula

choose constants corresponding to the 5s sublevel. Be-
cause this formula is only a semiempirical approximation,
it is important to use recombination coeﬃcients which are
consistent with the ionization coeﬃcients to prevent the
model from settling into an incorrect equilibrium charge
distribution.

The ratio between ionization and recombination coef-
ﬁcients can be obtained using the concept of equilibrium
constants. In a plasma at equilibrium, the rate of colli-
sions ionizing Xen+ to form Xe(n+1)+ + e− must be equal
to the rate at which Xe(n+1)+ + e− recombines to form
Xen+. The recombination coeﬃcients found in this man-
ner can then be applied to modeling the cluster plasma,
which is not, in general, in a state of chemical equilib-
rium.

These two rates are given respectively by

Equation (30) can now be combined with Eqs. (20) and

appropriate magnitude and which, in combination with
the ionization coeﬃcients, drive the system toward the
correct equilibrium distribution at all times.

A gas of charged particles has diﬀerent thermodynamic
properties from an ideal gas due to Coulomb interactions
between the constituent particles. Zel’dovich and Raizer
[33] calculate the adjustment to Keq due to a Debye-
H¨uckel potential. The equilibrium constant including

where the change in ionization potential due to Coulomb
eﬀects is ∆Pi =

between the ion core and an electron held at distance λD.
In our approach, by explicitly calculating bound state
energies for Debye-screened Hartree-Slater potentials,
we calculate this adjustment to the ionization poten-
tial directly. Our adjustment behaves similarly to

−

the Zel’dovich and Raizer correction, but is larger for
longer screening lengths and smaller at shorter screening
lengths.

One advantage to the equilibrium constant approach
is that it conceptually separates information about ther-
modynamic balance from the rate at which the system
seeks that balance. As a result, any formula for ioniza-
tion or recombination coeﬃcients could be substituted
for the Lotz formula, with the accuracies of the overall
rate and of the equilibrium constant used the only cri-
teria for validity of the formula. This advantage is also
seen in the formula by Hahn [34] which we employ in Sec.
V in calculating collisional ionization and recombination
during the cluster’s expansion.

Including the eﬀects of collisional ionization and re-
combination has a pronounced eﬀect on the evolution
of the cluster.
In Fig. 3, the evolution of the cluster
is calculated employing only photoionization and inverse
bremsstrahlung. In contrast, Fig. 6 shows the evolution
of the same cluster employing photoionization, inverse
bremsstrahlung, collisional ionization and recombination,
and evaporation of energetic electrons from the cluster.
Allowing ionization and recombination has the eﬀect of
producing charge states up to Xe8+ in substantial quanti-
ties, and of nearly doubling the energy per atom absorbed
by the cluster.

A. Cluster Dynamics During the Laser Pulse

As the cluster absorbs energy from the laser ﬁeld, some
of the electrons become so energetic that they are no
longer bound to the cluster. In addition, the cluster ex-
pands and cools due to hydrostatic forces from the hot
electrons and Coulomb repulsion as escaping electrons
leave a charge imbalance behind. These in turn aﬀect
the microscopic processes inside the cluster, since all such
processes depend on the concentrations of charge species
within the cluster. Collisional ionization and recombina-
tion are also sensitively dependent on the temperature of
the electron gas relative to electron binding energy.

For the evolution of the cluster during the period of the
laser pulse, we employed a simple model [35] of the clus-
ter expansion which tracks only the radius of the cluster,
the evaporation of electrons away from the cluster, and
the loss of heat from the electron gas accompanying both
processes. We did not consider the possibility of either
gross movement of electrons or spatial inhomogeneity of
charge species within the cluster, processes which a re-
cent theoretical study [36] has suggested may account
for the formation of highly charged ions detected at the
Hamburg experiment.

The equation for the radius of the cluster is given by

∂2r
∂t2 = 3

Pe + PCoul
nXemXe

r

,

(32)

where Pe = neTe is the electron pressure and PCoul =
Q2/(8πr4) is the Coulomb pressure resulting from the

charge built up as electrons evaporate away from the clus-
ter.

Our model of the laser–cluster dynamics also distin-
guishes between inner and outer ionization. Inner ioniza-
tion, which takes place due to photoionization and col-
lisional ionization, is the process by which electrons be-
come liberated from their parent ion and join the cluster
plasma, where they can undergo inverse bremsstrahlung
heating or collisional ionization/recombination. Outer
ionization is the process by which electrons with suﬃcient
energy escape the cluster and cease to have interactions
with it.

The rate of evaporation from a Maxwell distribution
of electrons can be calculated knowing the size of the
cluster, the mean free path of electrons in the cluster,
and the temperature of the electron plasma. The rate at
which electrons escape from the cluster is then given by

is the Maxwell distribution, and λe is the mean free path
in the cluster plasma, given by

λe =

T 2
4πne(Z + 1) ln Λ

for a plasma with average ion charge Z. The Coulomb
logarithm, ln Λ, is set equal to 1 in our calculation of the
mean free path. λe is constrained to be no greater than
2r, the diameter of the sphere.

As electrons evaporate from the cluster, the remaining
cluster becomes ever more highly charged, and a corre-
spondingly lower fraction of the Maxwell distribution has
enough energy to escape the cluster, thereby choking oﬀ
the evaporation rate.

It is likely that nearly all high-energy outer-ionized
electrons escape during this original period of evapora-
tion. As the cluster expands, the temperature of the
electron plasma falls very quickly as electron thermal en-
ergy is converted into ion kinetic energy, while the energy
required to escape the cluster falls only as 1/r.

A recent experiment [37] has for the ﬁrst time mea-
sured the energy spectrum for electrons emitted from
rare gas clusters exposed to intense VUV light. They give
ejection spectra for 70 atom xenon clusters exposed to a
1012 W/cm2 pulse of VUV light at the same pho-
4.4
ton energy as the original Hamburg experiment, ﬁnding
an electron distribution which decreases approximately
exponentially according to I = I0 exp (
Ekin/E0), with
E0 = 8.9 eV.

×

−

We calculated a spectrum of ejected electrons by step-
ping through a laser pulse using small timesteps. For
each timestep, we calculated the electron density, mean

8

free path, cluster radius, and plasma temperature. Us-
ing these parameters, we calculated the rate at which
electrons with energy E = Eesc + Ekin escaped from the
cluster using Eq. (33). Integrated through the timescale
of a pulse until the evaporation has stopped, this yields
an ejected electron spectrum for a single cluster exposed
to the pulse. Since the clusters are located randomly
with respect to the center of the laser pulse, we further
performed a spatial integration over the radial dimension
of the pulse, assuming a Gaussian proﬁle, from 0 to 3 σ.
After performing the spatial integration, we found that
on average .21 electrons per xenon atom evaporated from
the cluster in this way. The spectrum of ejection ener-
gies for these electrons shown in Fig. 4, although not
exponential, is nevertheless quite similar to the electron
spectrum found in Ref. [37].

The largest discrepancy between our calculated spec-
trum and the spectrum from [37] occurs at low ejection
energy. In addition, our model of the cluster expansion
predicts that the majority of electrons will comprise elec-
tron plasmas which remain bound to the cluster ions and
become quite cold during the process of expansion. These
electrons would reach the detector at low energies and
after long delay times, further boosting the spectrum at
low energies. However, Laarmann et al. note that for
Ekin < 2.5 eV, coinciding with the region of largest dis-
crepancy, the spectrum cannot be evaluated due to large
levels of noise in the background spectra.

Since electrons faster than about 1 eV are ejected from
the cluster during the pulse rather than during the slower
process of cluster expansion, the ejected electron spec-
trum has the potential to serve as a window into the
nature of the laser–cluster interaction. Accordingly, we
give the spectra for 1500 atom clusters exposed to a 100
1013 W/cm2 pulse, and for 2500 atom clusters

exposed to a 50 fs, 2.5

After spatial averaging, we ﬁnd that 1500 atom clus-
1013 W/cm2 pulse eject
ters exposed to a 100 fs, 7
0.15 electrons per atom during this early evaporation pe-
riod using the Wigner-Seitz cutoﬀ model for the screening
length (see section VII for a discussion of plasma screen-
ing). Using the Attard model, 0.07 electrons per atom
are evaporated during this period. For 2500 atom clus-
1013 W/cm2 pulse, the cor-
ters exposed to a 50 fs, 2.5
×
responding numbers are 0.04 electrons per atom for the
Wigner-Seitz cutoﬀ model and 0.01 electrons per atom
for the Attard model. In contrast to this, the Hamburg
experiment measured an average charge per ion of 2.98.
Hence, the electrons which comprise these ejected elec-
tron spectra correspond to only a few percent of all free
electrons at the time when the expanding clusters reach
the detector.

FIG. 4: Ejected electron spectrum. Comparison between the
best-ﬁt exponential taken from [37] and spatially-averaged
spectra calculated using 70 atom clusters exposed to a 4.4 ×
1012 W/cm2, 100 fs pulse for two diﬀerent models of plasma
screening. The Wigner Seitz cutoﬀ model uses the ordinary
Debye length as the screening radius, but the screening ra-
dius is not allowed to fall below xenon’s Wigner-Seitz radius
at liquid density, 4.64 bohr. The Attard model of screening
calculates the screening radius according to equation (47), dis-
cussed in Section VII. The spectrum calculated using xenon’s
Wigner-Seitz radius as a minimum screening distance displays
a strong similarity to the experimental curve.

increase to those of isolated Xe atoms, decreasing col-
lisional ionization and recombination rates. As overall
density of the cluster decreases, the ratio between colli-
sional ionization and recombination shifts according to
(22). As a result of these processes, chemical equilibrium
concentrations of the various charge species will shift dra-
matically on a time scale longer than that of the laser
pulse. The typical result is that lower charge states re-
assert themselves as the cluster expands. Conversely, this
means that more highly charged Xe ions participate in
the cluster heating than are detected in time of ﬂight de-
tectors long after the cluster has undergone expansion.
The importance of these transient charge states has been
noted many times in previous theoretical work on the
subject.

electric ﬁeld of the cluster. The cluster is modeled on a
one-dimensional radial lattice, with ﬁxed lattice points.
Adjacent lattice points form the boundaries for radial
bins. For each bin, we track the population and veloc-
ity of each charge state, the electron population, and the
(self-consistent) electric ﬁeld and potential evaluated at
the midpoint of the bin.

In our model, the electron plasma is assumed to be at

10

thermal equilibrium at all times. We constrain all elec-
trons to be bound to the cluster, in the sense that for any
electron, total energy = potential energy + kinetic energy
must be less than zero. Thus, we assume that all electron
evaporation, in the sense of electrons acquiring escape ve-
locity and ceasing to be part of the thermal distribution,
is accomplished during the period of laser–cluster inter-
action. All electrons which have not evaporated from the
cluster during the period of the laser–cluster interaction
remain in the electron plasma throughout the process of
expansion.

The idea of separating the (fast) electron dynamics has
been used several times before in descriptions of cluster
expansion. See Refs. [38, 39, 40, 41, 42].

Given these constraints, the electron distribution is

ne(r) ∝ fbound(r)eφ(r)/T ,

(34)

where φ(r) is the potential at radius r from the center of
the cluster, ne(r) is the density of electrons, and

fbound(r) =

is the fraction of a Maxwellian velocity distribution which
has kinetic plus potential energy less than zero at a radius
r.

Such a thermal model of the electron distribution has
a fundamental problem. Since the electric potential φ(r)
dies oﬀ as 1/r, the self-consistent electron density cal-
culated according to this method will not in general die
oﬀ faster than r−2, with the result that the expectation
value < r > of the electron distance from the center of
the cluster can unphysically grow without bound. We
avoid this problem by constraining all electrons to stay
within a radius of 8 times the rms radius of the highest
charge state (ie, the charge state furthest from the center
of expansion).

In contrast to the electron distribution, which is found
purely thermodynamically, we track the evolution of the
individual charge states purely hydrodynamically, using
ﬂuid equations for a zero-pressure charged ﬂuid. All ion
velocities are found hydrodynamically; in other words
there is no random thermal motion or diﬀusion in our
model of the ionic part of the cluster expansion.

Having found an electric potential which is consistent
with the electron distribution, the dynamics of the charge
states can be found according to the ﬂuid equation [39]

This system was modeled by assuming spherical symme-
try and partitioning the radial coordinate into a set of
bins. Within each bin, we tracked the population and
velocity of each charge state plus the population of elec-
trons, calculated using our self-consistent electron dis-
tribution. The velocities of each charge state were con-
strained to be positive.

As the plasma expands and cools, the screening length
of the plasma increases. With larger screening lengths,
the ionic species can once again support Rydberg states,
and it is necessary to consider these states in the pro-
cesses of collisional ionization and recombination. For ex-
ample, the well-known T −9/2 dependence of the recombi-
nation coeﬃcient on electron temperature arises because
of recollision into high-lying Rydberg states.

The problem of ionization from and recombination to
Rydberg states in a plasma has been addressed by Hahn
[34]. Hahn gives the ionization coeﬃcient for a hydro-

Collisional ionization and recombination introduce di-
rect interactions between ﬂuids of diﬀerent densities and
velocities. Thus, population transfer between diﬀerent
charge species can act to change the corresponding ﬂuid
velocities. We model this in a way which is designed
to conserve total kinetic energy of the ions. For every
timestep, we calculate the kinetic energy of each charge
state in each bin, as well as the fraction of the charge state
population which is transferred to other charge states
via ionization and recombination. We then model the
fraction of total kinetic energy transferred from a given
charge state in a given bin to another charge state in the
same bin resulting from ionization or recombination as
being directly proportional to the fraction of the origi-
nal charge state which is transferred. Then at the end
of the time step we calculate the (outward) velocity for
each charge state in each bin from the kinetic energy and
population. In this way, we are able to model the cluster
as it expands, becomes separated into shells of charge,
and adjusts its charge state distribution.

A byproduct of this non-homogeneous model of the
cluster expansion is that high charge states, being ac-
celerated faster than their low-charge state counterparts,
are preferentially found farther from the center of expan-
sion. Correspondingly, the concentration of higher charge
states tends to be lower, and they tend to inhabit regions
of lower electron density. Since the rates of ionization and
recombination are intimately related to ionic and electron
densities, an important eﬀect of charge state separation is
that populations of high charge states can be “frozen in”
at levels much higher than if the expanding gas were kept
constantly at chemical equilibrium. The rates of recom-
bination are so slow that the populations remain stable
despite the plasma as a whole being far from equilibrium.
a. Self-Consistent Electron Distribution It can be
quite diﬃcult to ﬁnd an electron distribution which is
consistent with the potential it induces. Previous ap-
proaches to the problem have included [39] and [40]. For
the current work, we have developed two new approaches
to this problem.

In the ﬁrst approach, given a candidate distribution of
electrons, we ﬁrst calculate the potential corresponding
to this distribution. We then remove from each bin some
fraction f of the bin’s initial population pi. This frac-
tion is then redistributed according to the Boltzmann
distribution as modiﬁed above. This procedure is con-
tinued until the diﬀerence in populations normalized by
pf )/f is less than some
the redistribution fraction (pi −
speciﬁed tolerance. As the distribution approaches self-
consistency, it is useful to decrease the fraction f which
is redistributed at each step.

A second method, which has the virtue of converging
quickly for an initial distribution which is close to self-
consistency, ﬁrst calculates for each bin the ratio of the
electron density to the Boltzmann factor

R =

ne
fboundeφ(r)/T

.
In a perfectly self-consistent distribution, this ratio
would be identical for all bins. Since in general this
equality will not exist, we calculate Ravg, the weighted
average density ratio. Then for each bin, we calculate
a new density ratio Rnew = (R/Ravg).999. The electron
distribution is then calculated using the new density ra-
tios, and normalized. This procedure is continued until
the maximum density ratio and minimum density ratio
disagree by no more than some tolerance.

we assumed a constant laser intensity along the direction
of propagation.

VII. NONIDEAL PLASMA SCREENING

As shown in Fig. 7, when plasma screening of the Xe
ions becomes strong enough to allow photoionization of
Xe+ into Xe2+, large numbers of extremely low-energy
electrons are added to the plasma. As a result, the ratio
of electron kinetic energy to electrostatic potential energy
falls dramatically, the Debye length of the plasma falls
abruptly below the Wigner-Seitz radius of xenon, and
the plasma enters a regime of strong correlation. In this
regime, a number of the assumptions of Debye-H¨uckel
screening model break down, and the Debye length loses
its meaning as a screening distance [43]. If the plasma
cools suﬃciently, screening lengths can become complex,
and result in oscillatory electron–ion correlation func-
tions [44, 45].

Another possibly important eﬀect of the strongly cou-
pled plasma was identiﬁed in a recent study [46], which
has identiﬁed electron dynamics in a strongly coupled
plasma as having a very large impact upon rates of many-
body recombination and hence upon energy absorption
by the cluster as the re-combined ions undergo multiple
episodes of photoionization.

Most calculations performed in this paper were per-
formed using xenon’s Wigner-Seitz radius at liquid den-
sity as a minimum value below which the screening was
not allowed to fall. Clearly, with the precise nature
of screening unknown in the strongly correlated regime,
our method of calculating atomic properties based on a
Debye-screened atomic potential acquires a correspond-
ing uncertainty. In an attempt to estimate this uncer-
tainty, we have described the evolution of the cluster us-
ing diﬀerent models for the screening length in a highly
correlated plasma.

Our simplest approximation applied xenon’s Wigner-
Seitz radius at liquid density as a minimum value below
which the screening was not allowed to fall. A second
model, proposed by Attard [45], deals with ions having
a nonzero radius. Strictly speaking, the Debye-H¨uckel
model for plasma screening is invalid except in the limit
of ions which have zero size. Attard has shown that in
the case where ions have a nonzero hard-sphere radius
d, the screening length λ = 1/κ diﬀers from the classical
Debye-H¨uckel length λD = 1/κD according to

Each laser pulse interacts with several clusters which
are distributed randomly with respect to the focal point
of the pulse. Assuming a gaussian laser proﬁle I(r)

ion energy over the range r = 0 to 3σ. The length of the

FIG. 7: The interaction of plasma screening with atomic
potentials is unknown as the screening length becomes very
short. Here the screening length vs time is given for a 1500
atom cluster exposed to a 100 fs, 7 × 1013 W/cm2 pulse, us-

charge states. Directly substituting the Attard screen-
ing length for the Debye length with Wigner-Seitz cutoﬀ
therefore gives some insight as to how sensitive our re-
sults are to diﬀerent models of the ionic potential under
very strong screening. As can be seen in Fig. 8 the At-
tard screening model has a relatively small impact on our
prediction for the energy absorbed by the cluster. More
prominent is the formation of higher charge states, which
is abetted by the reduced ionization potentials resulting
from the tighter screening in the Attard model. Figure 9
shows the plasma coupling parameter, a measure for the
nonideality of a plasma, for the two models, demonstrat-
ing that the Attard screening model gives rise to a more
strongly coupled plasma than the pure Debye model. In
addition, the two models give diﬀerent populations for
the various charge states at the end of the pulse; how-
ever, the combined eﬀects of the cluster expansion and
spatial averaging over the beam proﬁle act to destroy
much of this information.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

When a xenon cluster is irradiated by intense VUV
light, there are four phases in its evolution. In the ﬁrst
phase, electrons are liberated from the xenon atoms and
form a plasma. As the number of free electrons grows,
the screening length of the plasma shrinks.

Once the screening length of the plasma reaches 10.6
bohr, Xe1+ can undergo photoionization into Xe2+. This
results in the addition of large numbers of low-energy
electrons to the plasma, cooling it and decreasing the

FIG. 8: In contrast to Figure 6, allowing screening lengths to

screening length still further. The ratio of kinetic energy
to potential energy falls dramatically, and the plasma
temporarily becomes strongly coupled. Ionization poten-
tials for higher charge states fall with increased screening,
facilitating their creation.

In the third phase, the plasma undergoes rapid in-
verse bremsstrahlung heating. High charge states are
formed through collisional ionization and recombination,
and the cluster becomes charged as energetic electrons
evaporate away from its surface. The charge state dis-
tribution shifts rapidly toward higher charges, with the
average ionic charge reaching 5.5 at the pulse peak. This
distribution changes only slowly on the timescale of the
pulse.

FIG. 10: a) Ion population and b) Average kinetic energy
vs. charge state for the two sets of input parameters and as
recorded in the experiment. Nature parameters correspond to
1500 atom clusters exposed to a 100 fs, 7×1013 W/cm2 pulse,
while Thesis parameters correspond to 2500 atom clusters ex-
posed to a 50 fs, 2.5 × 1013 W/cm2 pulse. The experiment
could detect only charged ionic species; accordingly, the the-
oretical predictions have been normalized such that the sum
of the fractional populations for charged species is 1.

Finally, the cluster expands due to the pressure of the
electron gas and the cluster’s own charge. As the clus-
ter expands, the electron plasma cools and becomes more
diﬀuse. Screening lengths increase, and charge state equi-
librium shifts toward lower charge states.

Of these four phases, our current model describes the
ﬁrst and third phases well; the second and fourth phases
more crudely.

For strongly coupled plasmas, it is unclear whether
our treatment of plasma screening adequately describes

the potential seen by scattering or photoionizing elec-
trons. As the Debye length falls below the Wigner-Seitz
radius, the interaction of screening eﬀects due to inner-
shell electrons and eﬀects due to screening by continuum
plasma electrons should be considered. It is known that
the screening length diverges from the Debye length in
this limit, but the precise nature of the electron–ion po-
tential is unknown.

There is some diﬃculty in comparing our results to the
Hamburg experiment, due to experimental uncertainty
in laser intensity, temporal proﬁle, spatial proﬁle, and

cluster size. Whereas in the Nature paper the Hamburg
1013 W/cm2
group described the laser pulse as 100 fs, 7
incident on 1500 atom xenon clusters, Wabnitz’s thesis
[47] subsequently describes these pulses as 50 fs, 2.5
×
1013 W/cm2 pulses incident on 2500 atom clusters. In
addition, the temporal proﬁle of the laser pulses is not
Gaussian, and varies in an unpredictable way from pulse
to pulse due to the nature of the SASE ampliﬁcation
process, which starts from shot noise.

×

There are three distinctive features of the Hamburg
results which our model seeks to explain. First is the
surprising eﬃciency by which the clusters absorb pho-
tons, reﬂected in the high average energy per ejected ion.
Second is the quadratic dependence of ion ejection energy
on ionic charge. Third is the overall ionic distribution.
In addition, we attempt to explain the distinctive ejected
electron spectrum measured in [37].

Our model of the cluster expansion allows us to
model the changing charge state populations and energies
through the cluster expansion until the ions and electrons
have become so diﬀuse that recombination and ioniza-
tion no longer occurs. At this point, which can occur
at times long after the conclusion of the laser pulse, the
ionic populations and average energies can be compared
to the populations registered at the detector. Figure 10
compares our results to those obtained in the Hamburg
experiment.

Using a time of ﬂight detector which could detect only
charged ions, Wabnitz et al. reported an average ion en-
ergy of 400 eV, subsequently revised to 650 eV. After spa-
tial averaging, our model predicts an average ion energy
of 258 eV with the original input parameters. Including
the neutral xenon atoms which the Hamburg apparatus
is unable to detect decreases this average to 245 eV per
1013 W
atom. With a 50 fs, 2.5
cm2 pulse incident on 2500
atom clusters, these averages decrease to 136 eV and 127
eV per atom, respectively. We view the diﬀerences result-
ing from the diﬀerent sets of parameters as an estimate
of the experimental uncertainty. Since the temporal and
spatial proﬁles of the laser pulse are also unknown, it is
likely that the uncertainty is higher than accounted for
by this approach.

×

With either set of input parameters, our model yields a
relationship between ionic charge and ionic energy which
bends upward as in the Hamburg data; however we do not
duplicate the quadratic dependence of ejection energy on
charge state observed in the experiment.

While the data presented in the Nature paper was not
corrected for detector nonlinearities, Wabnitz’s thesis [47]
claims to make these corrections for the pulse identiﬁed
1013W/cm2 in the Nature paper. Error bars on
as 7
the charge state populations were not given. Both calcu-
lated charge state distributions show a rough similarity
to the experimental distribution, but in neither case is
this similarity particularly strong.

In conclusion, we have introduced a model of the laser–
cluster interaction in the VUV regime which takes into
account improved calculations of inverse bremsstrahlung
heating, photoionization, collisional ionization and re-
combination. The eﬀects of plasma screening on all of
these processes are included, and an alternative model of
very strong plasma screening has been considered.

The improved calculations of inverse bremsstrahlung
cross sections are smaller than those found in [22] by as
much as an order of magnitude. In some sense, then, the
results cited in [22] were fortuitous. However, the cen-
tral contention that atomic structure explains the cluster
heating is reinforced by our investigations.

We have also constructed a self-consistent hydrody-
namic model which tracks the cluster as it expands, cools,
and separates into shells of charge. We also track changes
in the ionic balance which occur as the diﬀerent charge
states interact with the electron plasma and collisionally
ionize or recombine into Rydberg states.

Using these two models, we have modeled the Ham-
burg experiment and achieved reasonably good agree-
ment with the Hamburg results. Whereas the Hamburg
group reported average energy per ion of 400-650 eV, our
results for the two sets of parameters yield 258 eV per
1013
ion for 1500 atom clusters exposed to a 100 fs, 7
W/cm2 pulse, 136 eV per ion for 2500 atom clusters ex-
1013 W/cm2 pulse. Our model
posed to a 50 fs, 2.5
of the cluster expansion yields an energy versus charge
spectrum which shows a similar dependence to the Ham-
burg data, though lower by a similar ratio. Our charge
state distributions show a rough similarity to those de-
tected in the experiment. Our model predicts formation
of charge states up to 8+ in abundances similar to those
found in the experiment.

×

×

In addition, we have with the same model calculated
the early electron ejection spectrum measured in [37] and
achieved great similarity to experiment, despite a cluster
size and pulse intensity which diﬀer signiﬁcantly from
those of the original Hamburg experiment. We have fur-
ther demonstrated that such spectra can depend strongly
on the model of plasma screening or the precise parame-
ters of the experiment, and can therefore serve as a possi-
ble window into the nature of the laser–cluster dynamics
during the time period of the pulse.

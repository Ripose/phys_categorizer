Abstract

We reconsider the homogeneous Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations for three-
body Coulombic systems with attractive Coulomb interactions and point out that
the resonant solutions are contaminated with spurious resonances. The spurious so-
lutions are related to the splitting of the attractive Coulomb potential into short-
and long-range parts, which is inherent in the approach, but arbitrary to some ex-
tent. By varying the parameters of the splitting the spurious solutions can easily be
ruled out. We solve the integral equations by using the Coulomb-Sturmian separa-
ble expansion approach. This solution method provides an exact description of the
threshold phenomena. We have found several new S-wave resonances in the e−e+e−
system in the vicinity of thresholds.

1 Introduction

Certainly, to calculate resonances in three body atomic systems the methods
based on complex coordinates are the most popular. The complex rotation

of the coordinates turns the resonant behavior of the wave function into a
bound-state-like asymptotic behavior. Then, standard bound-state methods
become applicable also for calculating resonances. The complex rotation of
the coordinates does not change the discrete spectrum, the branch cut, cor-
responding to scattering states, however, is rotated down onto the complex
energy plane, and as a consequence, resonant states from the unphysical sheet
become accessible.

In practice bound state variational approaches are used, that results in a
discretization of the rotated continuum. By changing the rotation angle the
points corresponding to the continuum move, while those corresponding to dis-
crete states, like bound and resonant states, stay. This way one can determine
resonance parameters.

However, in practical calculations the points of the discretized continuum scat-
ter around the rotated-down straight line. So, especially around thresholds it
is not easy to decide whether a point is a resonance point or it belongs to the
rotated continuum.

Recently, we have developed a method for calculating resonances in three-body
Coulombic systems by solving homogeneous Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equa-
tions [1] using the Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion approach [2]. As a
test case, we calculated the resonances of the negative positronium ion. We
found all the 12 resonances presented in Ref. [3] and observed good agreements
in all cases.

With our method we succeeded in locating 10 more resonances in the same en-
ergy region, all of them are very close to the thresholds. This is certainly due to
the fact that in Ref. [2] the threshold behaviors are exactly taken into account.
Unexpectedly we also observed that in the case of attractive Coulomb inter-
actions the Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations produce numerous resonant
solutions of dubious origin. We tend to regard them as spurious resonances
which come about from the somewhat arbitrary splitting of the potential in
the three-body conﬁguration space into short-range and long-range terms, that
is an inherent attribute of the theory.

Since the possible appearance of spurious states in the formalism is new and
surprising, for the sake of the better understanding of its mechanism, in Sec-
tion 2 we outline brieﬂy the Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equation formalism.
In our particular case of the e−e+e− system two particles are identical and
the set of Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations can be reduced to an one-
component equation. In Section 3 we discuss the spurious solutions. In Sec-
tion 4 the Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion method is applied to the
one-component integral equation. In Section 5 we present our new calculations
for the L = 0 resonances of the e−e+e− system and compare them with the

2 Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations

The Hamiltonian of a three-body Coulombic system is given by

H = H 0 + vC

1 + vC

2 + vC
3 ,

(1)

where H 0 is the three-body kinetic energy operator and vC
α denotes the Coulomb
potential in the subsystem α, with α = 1, 2, 3. We use throughout the usual
conﬁguration-space Jacobi coordinates xα and yα. Thus vC
α , the potential be-
tween particles β and γ, depends on xα.

The Hamiltonian (1) is deﬁned in the three-body Hilbert space. The three-
body kinetic energy, when the center-of-mass motion is separated, is given
by

H 0 = h0

xα + h0

yα = h0

xβ + h0

yβ = h0

xγ + h0

yγ ,

(2)

where h0 is the two-body kinetic energy. The two-body potential operators
are formally embedded in the three-body Hilbert space vC = vC(x)1y, where
1y is a unit operator in the two-body Hilbert space associated with the y
coordinate.

Merkuriev proposed [1] to split the Coulomb interaction in the three-body
conﬁguration space into short- and long-range terms

α = v(s)
vC

α + v(l)
α ,

where the short- and long-range parts are deﬁned via a splitting function:

v(s)
α = vC
α = vC
v(l)

α ζ(xα, yα)
α [1 − ζ(xα, yα)] .

The splitting function ζ is deﬁned in such a way that

is used. So, the separation into short- and long-range parts is made along a
parabola-like curve over the {x, y} plane. Typical shapes for v(s) and v(l) are
shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.

In atomic three-particle systems the sign of the charge of two particles are
always identical. Let us denote in our e−e+e− system the two electrons by
1 and 2, and the positron by 3. In this case vC
3 , the interaction between the
two electrons, is a repulsive Coulomb potential which does not support two-
body bound states. Therefore the entire vC
3 can be considered as long-range
potential. With splitting (3) the Hamiltonian can formally be written in a
form which looks like an usual three-body Hamiltonian with two short-range
potentials

where the long-range Hamiltonian is deﬁned as

H = H (l) + v(s)

1 + v(s)
2 ,

H (l) = H 0 + v(l)

1 + v(l)

2 + vC

Then, the Faddeev method is applicable and, in this particular case, results
in a splitting of the wave function into two components

with components deﬁned by

|Ψi = |ψ1i + |ψ2i,

|ψαi = G(l)(z)v(s)

α |Ψi,

where α = 1, 2 and G(l)(z) = (z − H (l))−1, z is a complex number.

In the case of bound and resonant states the wave-function components satisfy

Further simpliﬁcation can be achieved if we take into account that the two
electrons, particles 1 and 2, are identical and indistinguishable. Then, the
Faddeev components |ψ1i and |ψ2i, in their own natural Jacobi coordinates,
have the same functional forms

hx1y1|ψ1i = hx2y2|ψ2i = hxy|ψi.

On the other hand

|ψ2i = pP|ψ1i,

where P is the operator for the permutation of indexes 1 and 2 and p = ±1
are eigenvalues of P. Therefore we can determine |ψi from the ﬁrst equation
only

|ψi = G(l)

1 v(s)

1 pP|ψi.

It should be emphasized, that so far we did not make any approximation,
and although this integral equation has only one component, yet it gives full
account both of asymptotic and symmetry properties of the system.

3 Spurious resonance solutions

Let us suppose for a moment that the y0 parameter in ζ(x1, y1) is inﬁnite.
Then ζ would not depend on y1, the separation of the potential into short
and long range parts would go along a straight line, and v(l)
1 (x1, y1) would be
like a valley in the y1 direction. The potential v(l)
1 (x1, y1), which is Coulomb-
like along x1, would support inﬁnitely many bound states and, as free motion
along the coordinate y1 would be possible, the Hamiltonian H 0 + v(l)
1 would
have inﬁnitely many two-body channels.

If, however, y0 is ﬁnite, the straight line along the y1 direction becomes a
parabola-like curve and the valley, as y1 goes to inﬁnity, gets broader and
broader and shallower and shallower, and ﬁnally disappears (see Fig 2). As the
valley gets closed the continuum of H 0 + v(l)
1 associated with the y1 coordinate
becomes discretized. So, if y0 is ﬁnite, H 0 + v(l)
1 have inﬁnitely many bound
states. Similar analysis is valid also for H 0 + v(l)
2 , and consequently, also H (l)
has inﬁnitely many bound states.

This, however, due to (11), can lead to spurious solutions. If, at some energy,
H (l) has bound state G(l) has pole. Then, |ψαi in Eq. (11), irrespective of v(s)
α ,

6

can be ﬁnite even if |Ψi is inﬁnitesimal. These solutions are called spurious
solutions: although the Faddeev components are not identically zero, but their
sum vanishes.

Let us examine now the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian

H (l)

1 = H (l) + v(s)

1 = H 0 + vC

1 + v(l)

2 + vC
3 .

(17)

The three-body potential v(l)
2 (x2, y2)
2
vanishes as y2 tends to inﬁnity. Therefore, there are no two-body channels
associated with fragmentation 2, and of course neither with fragmentation 3,
the Hamiltonian H (l)

is attractive and constructed so that v(l)

1 has only 1-type two-body asymptotic channels.

What happens to the bound states associated with v(l)
2 ? They are embedded
in the the continuum of H 0 + vC
1 , and become resonant states. So, by solving
the Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations, at some complex energies, we can
encounter spurious solutions. These spurious solutions are not related to the
Hamiltonian H, but rather only to some auxiliary potentials coming from the
splitting procedure. Consequently, the spurious resonances should be sensitive
to the parameters of ζ, while the physical resonances not. This way we can
easily distinguish between physical and spurious resonance solutions.

4 Coulomb-Sturmian potential separable expansion approach

We solve Eq. (16) by using the Coulomb–Sturmian separable expansion ap-
proach [4]. The Coulomb-Sturmian (CS) functions are deﬁned by

hr|nli =

1/2

n!
(n + 2l + 1)! #

"

(2br)l+1 exp(−br)L2l+1

(2br),

n

(18)

with n and l being the radial and orbital angular momentum quantum num-
bers, respectively, and b is the size parameter of the basis. The CS functions
{|nli} form a biorthonormal discrete basis in the radial two-body Hilbert
space; the biorthogonal partner is deﬁned by hr|
nli = hr|nli/r. Since the
three-body Hilbert space is a direct product of two-body Hilbert spaces an
appropriate basis can be deﬁned as the angular momentum coupled direct
product of the two-body bases

(n, ν = 0, 1, 2, . . .),

where |nli1 and |νλi1 are associated with the coordinates x1 and y1, respec-
tively. With this basis the completeness relation takes the form (with angular

Now, the spectra of gy1(z′) and gx1(E + iε − z′) are well separated and the
spectrum of gy1 can easily be encircled such that the spectrum of gx1 does not
penetrate into the encircled area (Fig. 3). Next, the contour C is deformed
analytically in such a way that the upper part descends into the unphysical
Riemann sheet of gy1, while the lower part of C is detoured away from the cut
(Fig. 4). The contour still encircles the branch cut singularity of gy1, but in
the ε → 0 limit it now avoids the singularities of gx1. Moreover, by continuing
to negative values of ε, in order that we can calculate resonances, the pole

S-wave resonances in positronium ion

To calculate resonances we have to ﬁnd the complex zeros of the Fredholm
determinant (24). To locate them we calculate D(z) along the real energy axis
with small step size. In the vicinity of zeros the D(z) exhibits violent changes.
Then we have a good starting point for the zero search. This way we can easily
ﬁnd resonances, at least the narrow ones. To ﬁnd broad resonances one should
proceed by calculating D(E − iε) with ﬁnite ε > 0.

For the parameters of the splitting function we take y0 = 50a0 and ν = 2.1, a0
is the Bohr radius. To select out the physical solutions we vary the short- and
long-range potentials by taking x0 = 18a0, 25a0 and 30a0, respectively. We can
also vary the potentials by adding and subtracting a short-range term

v(s)
1 = vC
v(l)
1 = vC

1 ζ(x1, y1) + v0ζ(x1, y1)
1 [1 − ζ(x1, y1)] − v0ζ(x1, y1),

(29)

(30)

respectively, while keeping a ﬁxed x0 = 18a0 value. This new kind of split-
ting goes beyond the Merkuriev’s original suggestion, but since the charac-
ter of v(s) and v(l) remained the same all the nice properties of the origi-
nal Faddeev-Merkuriev equations are retained. In these calculations we used
v0 = 0, 0.01, 0.02 values.

We found that some solutions, especially their widths, are very sensitive to the
change of either x0 or v0 parameters. We regard them spurious solutions. Those
solutions, given in Table I, were stable against all changes of parameters and
we can consider them as physical resonances. We recovered all the resonances
presented in Ref. [3] with very good agreements, but besides that we found 10
more resonances, all of them are in the vicinity of some thresholds.

. The energies and widths are expressed in Rydbergs.

In this article we pointed out that in the Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equation
approach of the three-body Coulomb problem the complex-energy spectrum
is contaminated with spurious solutions. The spurious solutions, however, are
sensitive to the splitting of the potential into short- and long-range terms.

12

This oﬀers an easy way to select the physical solutions.

We solved the integral equations by using the Coulomb-Sturmian separable
expansion approach. This method gives an exact description of the thresh-
old phenomena, thus the method is ideal for studying close-to-threshold reso-
nances. In the e−e+e− system we located 10 new resonances, all of them are
in the close vicinity of some threshold.

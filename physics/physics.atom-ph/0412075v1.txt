Abstract. The dissociation spectrum of the hydrogen molecular ion by short intense pulses
of infrared light is calculated. The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation is discretized and
integrated in position and momentum space. For few-cycle pulses one can resolve vibrational
structure that commonly arises in the experimental preparation of the molecular ion from
the neutral molecule. We calculate the corresponding energy spectrum and analyze the
dependence on the pulse time-delay, pulse length, and intensity of the laser for λ
790nm.
We conclude that the proton spectrum is a both a sensitive probe of the vibrational dynamics
and the laser pulse. Finally we compare our results with recent measurements of the proton
spectrum for 55 fs pulses using a Ti:Sapphire laser (λ
790nm). Integrating over the laser
1015W cm−2, we ﬁnd our results are in excellent
focal volume, for the intensity I
agreement with these experiments.

1. Introduction

Energy transfer mechanisms in molecules exposed to short intense laser pulses is of great
current interest [1]. Processes such as multiple photoionization, multiphoton dissociation and
high-order harmonic generation have been studied for a wide-range of molecular species and
an excellent up-to-date review of the ﬁeld has been provided by Posthumus [2]. The hydrogen
molecule and molecular ion represent ideal systems for a detailed understanding of ionization
and dissociation dynamics of small molecules [3]. The simplicity of molecule means that
it is the system of choice for theoretical studies. In general the mechanisms of dissociation
[4] and ionization [20, 16, 17] are very well characterised for this molecule. Nonetheless,
the solution of three-body disintegration, incorporating spatial and temporal variations in the
laser pulse as well as the thermal ensemble of molecular states, remains a severe challenge for
simulation. Consequently, progress has been fairly limited in dissociative ionization spectrum
calculations.

Although there exists a wealth of data on the photofragment energy spectrum for the
the data for the much simpler isolated

neutral molecule, H2, and its deuterated forms [2].

molecular ion is extremely scarce. The feasibility of experimental studies is hampered by the
difﬁculty in preparing the molecular ion. In fact experiments on H+
2 in intense laser ﬁelds has
only become possible in the last 4 years [10, 11, 12, 13] due to reﬁnements in ion sources
and charged molecular beam spectroscopy. Typically a small portion of the molecules, at a
temperature of a few hundred Kelvin and hence predominantly in the vibrational state (v = 0),
can be converted into the bound molecular ion by electron-impact ionization,

e− + H2(1Σg, v = 0)

e− + e− + H+

2 (2Σg, v′) .

The molecular ions can be extracted, cooled and collimated into a beam that can be injected
to the focus of the laser. The photodissociation and/or photoionization processes,

n′hν + H+

2 (2Σg, v′)

H∗ + H+ + n′′hν

produce ions and electrons that can be collected and analysed. Owing to the small nuclear
mass, the expansion (vibration) is very rapid - on the scale of 10 fs or less. Consequently
the molecule relaxes extremely rapidly on the timescale of the pulse rise time. The design of
infrared pulses that would, among other things, allow the resolution of timescale of a fraction
of a femtosecond.

The main aim of this paper is a direct comparison of theory and experiment for the
proton energy spectrum produced by a short intense infrared pulse interacting with H+
2 [10,
12]. Fragment-ion coincidence measurements that isolate the dissociation and dissociative
ionization processes and make the comparison of theory and experiment feasible and realistic.
The molecular dissociation dynamics are modelled using a two-state approximation and takes
account of the laser pulse proﬁle. Although this approach neglects the ionization channels,
the results for dissociation energies are in excellent agreement with the observations.

15 fs and
170 fs, respectively. For a pulse duration 60 fs or less, the laser interaction is
Trot ∼
sudden on the rotational timescale. Thus one can assume a random statistical orientation
of the molecular axis, and that the nuclei recoil along the axial direction. We assume that the
bound ion is created by vertical transitions from the v = 0 state of the neutral H2(X 1Σg). The
parameters of this potential surface are, bond length R0 = 1.40a.u. with vibrational constants,
~ω0 = 0.546eV and xe = 0.0276. The v = 0 wavepacket is promoted onto the corresponding
0 = 2.65eV, ~ω′ = 0.288eV
molecular-ion surface H +
e = 0.0285 [41]. The v = 0 state is projected onto the v′ manifold of states according
and x′
to the Franck-Condon principle [34]. The manifold of v′-states is then subjected to intense
Ti:Sapphire light.

In the dissociation process, momentum is conserved, for a symmetric pulse, and the
recoiling atom and ion have equal and opposite velocity in the centre-of-mass frame. The ions
and atoms are collected in coincidence such that dissociation and dissociative ionization can

be discriminated. However, depending on the method of measurement, the atomic fragments
can arise from the entire focal volume of the laser. So a valid theoretical comparison
must ﬁrstly establish the single molecule energy spectra, and then sum these spectra with
the appropriate focal volume weighting for the experiment. The intensity I0(ρ, z) of a
focused cylindrically-symmetric laser beam is spatially Gaussian in the radial r-direction and
Lorentzian along the axis z [1]

respectively. In our method, we ﬁrst discuss the single-molecule response in detail, and then
describe the orientation-averaged and focal-volume integrated results.

The electronic coordinate, with respect to the origin at the internuclear midpoint, is
denoted by r and the internuclear coordinate is written as R. The two lowest electronic states,
namely the ground state X 2Σ+
(φu) are sufﬁcient for the study of pure
g
dissociation dynamics. The corresponding adiabatic energies are Eg(R) and Eu(R). Then the
two-state approximation is

Ψ(r, R, t) = Fg(R, t)φg(r, R) + Fu(R, t)φu(r, R)

where Fg(R, t) and Fu(R, t) are the time-dependent nuclear wavefunctions. In restricting
the electronic spectrum to the two lowest levels, the calculations will inevitably be gauge
dependence. For low frequency ﬁelds (much less than the energy level gap) it is essential
to use the length gauge for the laser-molecule interaction. Let us take the light as linearly
polarized along the direction ε , and denote the dipole moment between φu,g as µ(R). Writing
the electric ﬁeld as E(t), the coupling potential is denoted by VL(R, t) =
µ(R)E(t)u, where
ˆR. Within the axial-recoil approximation, θk = cos−1 u, is the angle of ejection of the
u
ion(atom) with respect to the polarization vector. Averaging over the molecular orientation is
equivalent to averaging the projection of the electric ﬁeld along the molecular axis. Since the
1014 W cm−2, it
dissociation rate increases rapidly with intensity over the range, I
follows that the atoms and ions are ejected predominantly along the polarization direction. It
1015 W cm−2, the dissociation
is highly anisotropic. However at the higher intensities, I
process begins to saturate and, as we will show, the angular distribution is broader.

As is well known [26], for R

2 R, and the coupling is
divergent in the molecular basis. This is simply a manifestation of the molecular basis and
the use of the length gauge. It is necessary and convenient to transform to the asymptotic
decoupled atomic eigenstates for the energy spectrum. These asymptotic states then evolve
adiabatically at large distances and long times. However these states in turn are unbounded
in conﬁguration space. As shown by Keller [30], it is possible to project the diffuse adiabatic
asymptotic states onto a compact momentum space. More importantly, this methods produces
the energy spectrum of the atoms that can be compared with experiment.

→

Following [28, 30] we divide the entire range of R into two regions; an internal
region(in), where the molecular forces are signiﬁcant, and an asymptotic region (as) where
they are not. The short-range polarization potential means that the interaction region can
be comparatively small (of the order 20 a.u.). Then the wavefunction can be partitioned as
follows:

2.4. Transformation to momentum space

The key step in obtaining an energy spectrum is the projection of the numerical wavefunction
onto the the continuum of asymptotic states (22). It is efﬁcient to do this by discretizing the
k-space and performing a ﬁnite Fourier transform [30]. One difﬁculty with such an approach
is that the momentum shift ∆0 is a continuous function and inevitably leads to a mismatch of
the k-grid. In the present calculations, we use the quadrature rule for the DVR to calculate the
Fourier transform directly. We deﬁne the shifted Fourier transform:

Although this quadrature is less efﬁcient than the fast-Fourier transform, it allows for much
greater ﬂexibility in choosing the k and R grids.

At each time step, the projection onto the momentum space is made and the coherent
momentum space wavefunction is calculated. This process is repeated and continued for
some time after the end of the pulse. This allows the dissociating wavepacket still within the
interaction region time to reach the asymptotic zone, and for the low energy components to
be captured. Typically we extend the integration time to 4Tc for this purpose. The k-space
probability density is then given by [30]:

Firstly we consider photodissociation directly from v′ = 0 of H+
2 . There are several very
accurate proton spectra calculation for v′ = 0 dissociation by λ
330nm pulses for
1014 W cm−2 [6, 30]. We checked our calculations with these results and found
I
excellent agreement in all cases. Now consider long-wavelength dissociation, we recall that
the dissociation energy of the v′ = 0 state is D′
790nm, corresponding
to the Ti:Sapphire laser, the photon energy is 1.57 eV. Therefore dissociation is necessarily a
second or higher order process. In ﬁgure 1 we present results for the proton energy spectrum
PE(Ep) for a Tp = 55fs pulse for a range of intensities. In these calculations, the number of
points in R-space N = 512 and the number of points in momentum space Nk = 2048, with

channels change dramatically with the variation of the pulse intensity. There is a propensity
for the high-order process. As the interaction increases there is a leftward shift of the three-
photon peaks in frame (e) to (g). This is due to the downwards Stark shift of the ground state.
The leading-order term of this shift is approximately linear with intensity. The broadening of

the peaks is evidence of the mixing of vibrational levels and shortening of the lifetime of the
decaying state v′ = 0. In the last ﬁgure (h) at the highest intensity the spectrum is dominated
by a large broad peak around 0.7 eV where the ﬁeld-free vibrational structure is destroyed.
At intensities above 1015 W cm−2, the process is saturated by tunelling dissociation and the
spectrum is dominated by low energy (less than 0.5 eV) protons [4]. This data underlines the
difﬁculty in using time-independent perturbation theory to determine the ion spectrum and
yield under these conditions.

×

The second calculation (ﬁgure 2) concentrates on the effect of pulse length for a ﬁxed
1014 W cm−2. For pulses shorter than 15 fs the vibrational phase is accepted
intensity I = 5
to play a role. However it is also important to note that the bandwidth has a signiﬁcant
effect. For example, a 5 fs pulse has a bandwidth of the order 0.35 eV. This would explain
the skewness of the peak in ﬁgure 2(a), and the presence of the 4-photon peak. However, in
ﬁgures 2(b) and 2(c), the results resemble the narrow-band data in ﬁgure 1. The oscillations
in the peaks reﬂect wavepacket oscillations within the well and we discuss this in more detail
later when investigating dissociation from excited vibrational states.

Dissociation of H+

2 by short, intense IR pulses

3.2. Dissociation from H2 (v = 0) at λ = 790nm

In the ion-beam experiments, H+
2 is prepared from the collisional ionization process (equation
1). The H2 (v = 0) state is projected onto a coherent superposition of the H+
2 vibrational
states, Fv′, where v′ = 0, 1, . . . , 17. The amplitudes Cv′ are given by the Franck-Condon
factors. So that [34] in the absence of the laser the wavepackt evolves coherently

Fg(R, t′) = eiφ(t)

Cv′eiφv′ −iEv′ t′

Fv′(R)

17

Xv′=0

where the relative phases φv′ are well deﬁned constants, and Ev′ are the vibrational energies.
The overall phase φ(t) depends on the time of formation of the ion. According to the Franck-
Condon factors, the largest coefﬁcients correspond to v′ = 2, 3, 4. However a small fraction of
the population will be above the dissociation limit leading to shake-off dissociation. Dunn’s
[34] estimate of this population was around 2.8%. In the present calculations, using the energy
curves of equation (8), we obtain a value around 0.8%. In experiment the shake-off process
is eliminated and plays no role. However, the coherence of the v′ states has an important
role. Since t′ = 0 is determined by the start of the pulse the molecules arrive in the focal
volume with random vibrational phase. The random nature of the time delay is equivalent to
averaging over random vibration phase. We can readily illustrate the physical consequences
of this time delay in the proton spectrum. Suppose we choose the initial wavepacket as:

Fg(R, t′ = 0) = FH2(v = 0, t = 0)

Then 0.8% of this wave function will naturally dissociative (shake-off) without laser
interaction. In the calculations shown in 3, we present the proton energy distribution in the
1010 W
perturbation regime for a long pulse. The laser intensities are 5
cm−2 respectively, with λ = 790 nm and pulse duration Tp = 55 fs. The intensity-independent
background that peaks at zero energy is the shake-off process. The rapid oscillations in
this background are artifacts arising from the numerical method. The lowest energy states
emerge most slowly and require long propagation times. The major source of noise is the
splitting procedure that creates an interference pattern in the long-wavelength wavepacket
components. However, above 0.3 eV the interference artifacts disappear and we are conﬁdent
in the numerical accuracy of the energy spectrum in this range.

The 1-photon dissociation threshold means that only levels v′

5 appear. However
the peak heights are modulated according to the values of both Cv′ and the Franck-
Condon dissociation factors. This vibrational structure has been resolved and measured
experimentally [12, 13]. As predicted by the perturbation theory, the probability for the
individual peak is proportional to the laser intensity. Very recently, Serov and coworkers
[36] have obtained results of excellent agreement with these experimental measurements after
careful consideration of averaging over initial ro-vibrational states and over the focus volume
effect of the laser pulse.

theory. In order to compare with experiment, it is desirable to eliminate the spurious shake-off

background. This can be achieved by projecting out the continuum or by waiting for the shake-
off to occur and absorb the dissociation. In fact, the shake-off background is an imperceptible
perturbation to the results at high intensity, as shown in ﬁgure 4. In practice, for intensities
1011 W cm−2, we have not found it necessary to remove the shake-off wavepacket
above 5
a priori. At higher intensities the two-photon dissociation process becomes important, and in
ﬁgure 4 (b) we include vertical dotted lines to indicate the expected positions of these peaks.
Again, at the highest intensities, the spectrum peaks move towards the lower energies although
the spectrum also broadens. The peak heights in ﬁgure 4 (c) and (d) are similar, but the yield
is much higher for the higher intensity. The corresponding dissociation probabilities Pd for
each intensity are ????. As mentioned before, increasing the angle between molecule and
polarization is equivalent to decreasing the intensity. Then ﬁgure 4 represents the angular-
differential dissociation rates. Thus for a spatially uniform pulse of cycle-average intensity
1014 W cm−2, ﬁgures 4 (b),(c) and (d) are respectively the yields at θ =72, 84 and 88
I = 5
degrees. For pulses much longer than the vibrational time, the initial phase of the molecular
wavepacket is not a signiﬁcant factor. Averaging over the initial phase has little effect. In the
next section we will consider pulses of duration comparable to the vibrational dephasing time.

In the well-known ’pump and dump’ technique, for heavy atoms within a molecule, the
vibrational motion can be easily resolved by 100 fs pulses. However for the hydrogen atom
15fs) that this requires pulses of 40 fs or shorter. We have already
the vibration is so fast (
shown (ﬁgure 2) that for H+
2 , the vibrational phase has a role for 20fs or less. In this section
we consider the effect on the coherent wavepacket of v′ states created from the v = 0 state,
and speculate on whether this can be resolved by experiments measuring the proton emission
spectrum. We begin with a study of pulse length effects for the coherent state. In ﬁgure (5) the
1011 W cm−2,
features of the low-intensity pulse are considered for λ = 790nm and I = 5
choosing the molecular vibration phases by starting the clock (pulse) at t′ = 0. As noticed
previously for v′ = 0, for very short pulses the bandwidth broadening and reduced duration
leads to a ﬂat spectrum with low dissociation yield.
Increasing the pulse duration allows
the vibrational structure to be clearly resolved at Tp = 40fs and the familiar Franck-Condon
distribution highlighted in ﬁgure (3) is apparent. Also evident in ﬁgure(5) is the interference
of the shake-off background with the low-energy spectrum.

1011 W cm−2 and

At higher intensity it has been shown that the vibrational signature in the dissociation
spectrum can be destroyed to a large extent, even for long pulses. Increasing intensity to
1013 W cm−2, conﬁrms that this occurs for the coherent state (ﬁgure 6). Firstly , the
I = 5
proton energies shift to less than 1eV. We note that for the 40 fs pulse, the data is very similar
to the 55 fs pulse shown in ﬁgure 4 (c). At the other end of the time scale, for 5fs pulses, the
protons emerge with much higher energies

×

That is, apart from the broadening of the peak due to bandwidth effects, the wavepacket
favours the high frequency part of the pulse. However it is clear that in this case the pulse
delay, or molecular phase, has an important role [37, 38] and [39, 40].
In ﬁgure (7) we
consider the 5 fs pulse and we present results for the wavepacket distribution in space along
with the proton energy spectrum. The pulse is delayed by up to 20 fs with respect to the
molecular vibration. Firstly examining the energy spectrum, there is clearly a strong variation
with pulse delay. The 0.7eV peak that appears in ﬁgure 5 corresponding to the 5 fs peak
with time delay 0 fs is clearly present in ﬁgure 7. The corresponding state in R-space is
the Gaussian wavepacket centred at R = 1.4. The short delay time allows the molecule
to dissociate from small R values and accelerate along the Σu curve. With a delay of 1 fs
the wavepacket moves outwards and disperses, this delay severely decreases the dissociation
yield and attenuates the dissociation energy. After 7fs delay the molecular wavepacket is
at the outer turning point. A pulse applied at this time yields a low yield peaked around
0.4 eV. As the delay time increases the vibrational components separate and dephase. At
20 fs for example, the wavepacket is irregular and diffuse as the high v′ components become
evident. The dissociation from this wavepacket produces a strong low-energy signal at 0.3 eV.

1013 W cm−2

Comparing with ﬁgure 4 for example, this energy can only be a bandwidth shifted state. That
is, the v = 9 state dissociating through a low energy photon. In a real experiment the random
phases of vibration mean that these details are often lost. The molecular phase (clock) can be
synchronized by using the same laser for photoionization and dissociation [37, 38]. However,
the assumption that primary photoionization of H2 is a vertical transition has recently been
shown to be invalid [14]. This is not too surprising since it is generally not a good assumption
for infrared light at high intensity. However it is a reasonable model for UV light or electron
impact ionization.

Clearly the sensitivity of the proton spectrum is potentially a very useful tool for
experimental diagnostics. The difﬁculty still exists in that a real laser pulse has temporal
and spatial variations that can impede the observation of these details. For a long pulse
Tp = 40 fs, our calculations show that the kinetic energy distribution is not sensitive to the
1013 W
time-delay at the same intensity of 5
cm−2, the spectrum shows only small structure effects due to pulse delay. In order to test our
model with experiment we conclude our paper with a study in which we take into account the
experimental parameters and integrate over the focal volume of the pulse and average over
molecular orientation.

3.4. Comparison with Experiment

The experiment [10] allows the dissociative and dissociative ionization processes can be
discriminated by coincidence time-of-ﬂight measurements. The spectrum can be dominated
by the large low intensity focal volume. For a theoretical model the relevant spectrum is the
probability distribution given by

the averaging process. The small resonant structures in the theoretical modelling correspond
to the dissociation from different vibrational levels. At this intensity, saturation occurs at the
centre of the focus, thus a large fraction of the dissociation fragments arise from the outer
intensity shells. This is conﬁrmed by our calculation in which the proton spectrum has a
1015 W cm−2. Nonetheless the
similar shape for a peak intensity 5
shape and ion yield of the experiment are extremely well characterised in this experiment, and
it is highly encouraging that theory and experiment are in such good agreement. More recent
measurement techniques, develop in the last two years, allow sections of the focal volume
to be studied, providing and much more detailed examination of the proton spectrum. These
new measurements will hopefully reveal some of the features of the proton energy spectrum
described in our paper.

4. Conclusions

In summary, we have thoroughly investigated the dissociation dynamics of H+
2 in strong laser
ﬁelds. The vibrational-state resolved kinetic energy distributions have been calculated at
1015 W cm−2 for λ = 790nm. The
109 W cm−2 to 3
various intensities ranging from 5
results show the sensitivity of the kinetic energy distribution on the laser intensity, molecular
orientation, the pulse length and the pulse delay. At very high intensity, our focus-averaging

results reproduce the experimental measurements very accurately [10]. Most importantly, we
demonstrate that molecular dissociation dynamics at rather low intensity with a short pulse
duration would be more suitable to act as a sub-femtosecond molecular clock.

A second plateau in the harmonic spectra of a laser-driven two-electron model atom is observed. It
is shown that the harmonics well beyond the usual cut-oﬀ are due to the simultaneous recombination
of the two electrons, which were emitted during diﬀerent, previous half-cycles. The new cut-oﬀ is
explained in terms of classical trajectories. Classical predictions and the time-frequency analysis
of the ab initio quantum results are in excellent agreement. The mechanism corresponds to the
inverse single photon double ionization process in the presence of a (low frequency) laser ﬁeld. The
rather low eﬃciency of the process is shown to be substantially enhanced by controlling the electron
emission times using attosecond xuv pulses.

High-order harmonic generation (HOHG) is one of
the fundamental processes that occur when intense laser
pulses interact with atoms or molecules (see, e.g., Refs.
[1, 2] for recent reviews). In the case of a linearly polar-
ized incoming laser ﬁeld, odd multiples of the laser fre-
quency are emitted with a relatively high and almost con-
stant eﬃciency (≃ 10−6) up to the celebrated Ip +3.17 Up
cut-oﬀ [3], where Ip is the ionization potential and Up is
the ponderomotive energy (i.e., the time-averaged quiver
energy of a free electron in the laser ﬁeld). In such a way,
coherent short-wavelength radiation down to the “water
window” could be generated using “table-top” equipment
[4, 5]. HOHG is also the key to the production of attosec-
ond laser pulses [1, 2] that oﬀer the possibility to study
fast atomic processes directly in the time domain [6].

HOHG up to the Ip + 3.17 Up cut-oﬀ is, in a very good
approximation, a single active electron-eﬀect, meaning
that at a given laser intensity only a single electron,
namely the one that is next in the row for sequential
ionization, contributes to the harmonic generation. Var-
ious aspects of two- and many-electron eﬀects on HOHG
were studied in Refs. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. However, to
the best of our knowledge nonsequential double recom-
bination (NSDR) and the associated second plateau has
not been revealed so far.

The known cut-oﬀ at Ip + 3.17 Up can be explained
within the so-called “simple man’s theory” (see, e.g., the
review Ref. [14] and references therein): an electron is re-
leased with vanishing initial velocity at the emission time
te due to ionization by a laser ﬁeld with a vector potential
A(t) and an electric ﬁeld E(t) = −∂tA(t). Thereafter,
the electron moves freely in the laser ﬁeld without be-
ing aﬀected anymore by the binding potential V (r), i.e.,
its momentum and position at time t > te are given by
p(t) = A(t)−A(te) and r(t) = α(t)−α(te)−A(te)(t−te),
t dt′ A(t′) is the excursion of
respectively, where α(t) =
a free electron in the ﬁeld (atomic units ~, m, |e|, 4πǫ0 = 1
R
are used unless noted otherwise). In order for a harmonic
photon being emitted, the electron has to revisit the ion
at some time tr > te, that is, r(tr) != 0, since only then

its overlap with the ground state—and thus the recom-
bination probability—is appreciable. The energy of the
emitted harmonic photon is given by Ω = p2(tr)/2 + Ip.
Searching the pairs (te, tr) for which r(tr)=0 and p2(tr)/2
is maximum, leads in the case of a constant-amplitude,
linearly polarized laser ﬁeld in dipole approximation, e.g.,
A(t) = ˆAez sin ωt, to max(p2(tr)/2) = 3.17 Up where
Up = ˆA2/4.

Let us now consider a two-electron atom or ion where
the two electrons are freed by sequential ionization. The
possible kinetic return energies Er = p2(tr)/2 are shown
in Fig. 1. Each of the two electrons has a maximum
return energy 3.17 Up.
If both electrons moved along
the same trajectory in the continuum and recombined
together, emitting a single photon, one would expect a
HOHG cut-oﬀ at 2 · 3.17 Up + I (1)
p the ion-
ization potential for the ith electron. However, electron
repulsion renders this process extremely unlikely since
the two electrons would have to “sit on top of each other”
for about half a laser cycle (which is even less likely than
“collective tunneling” [13]). Instead, if the electrons are
emitted at certain times during subsequent or next but
one half cycles, there are trajectories that do not cross
before the recombination event, so that their mutual re-
pulsion plays only a minor role (and is compensated by
the attraction of the ionic potential). Such trajectories
are shown in Fig. 1b. If, with respect to the ﬁrst electron,
the second electron is emitted during the subsequent half
cycle, the sum of return energies around its maximum
value is shown in Fig. 1a (indicated by “2 + 1”). For the
constant-amplitude pulse one ﬁnds 4.70 Up. If, however,
the delay between the emission of ﬁrst and second elec-
tron is greater than half a cycle the sum of the return
energies can be even higher, as clearly visible from the
values labelled by “3 + 1” in Fig. 1a. The HOHG cut-oﬀ
for NSDR is then expected at

max(ΩNSDR) = 5.55 Up + I (1)

In the following, we will show that this cut-oﬀ can be
clearly identiﬁed in ab initio solutions of the two-electron,

in Fig. 2. Besides the result for the fully correlated sys-
tem with both electrons active, the corresponding spectra
for a frozen, inner electron (labelled “SAE”, drawn blue)
and He+ (drawn red) are shown. For the single active
electron (SAE)-calculation, a frozen Hartree-Fock poten-
tial (leading to the proper ionization potential for the
outer electron I (1)
p = 0.904) was used. Not surprisingly,
the SAE spectrum agrees well with the two active elec-
tron (TAE)-result throughout the “usual” plateau (whose
cut-oﬀ 3.17 Up +I (1)
[18] is indicated by arrow 1) because

at the chosen laser intensity it is the outer electron that
contributes most to HOHG. As expected, the plateau of
the He+-spectrum is several orders of magnitude lower

half cycle (1, black), the second (2, cyan), the third (3, red)
etc. reach their maximum return energy 3.17 Up during the
subsequent half cycle. At later returns only lower values are
achieved. However, if these energies are added to those of a
second electron returning at the same time (but ionized later
than the ﬁrst electron), the values indicated by “2 + 1” and
“3 + 1” are obtained (the sum “3+2” equals “2+1” in height
and is omitted in the plot). The three classical trajectories of
electrons, all returning at tr/T = 1.72 (vertical dotted line),
are plotted in (b).

Switching-oﬀ electron-electron correlation in the two-
electron TDSE-code is equivalent to the simulation of two
independent He+-ions. For the latter, NSDR is impossi-
ble, showing that at the time of recombination, electron
correlation is clearly required for NSDR to happen since
otherwise the two electrons cannot emit their total en-
ergy in a single photon. This is well known for the inverse
process, i.e., single photon double ionization.

It is interesting to see that around arrow 3 in Fig. 2 a
qualitative change occurs: for lower harmonic frequencies
the spectrum displays a rich interference structure be-
cause many “quantum trajectories” [14] contribute. The
situation changes for the harmonic orders where only the
classical solutions with tr/T ∈ [3, 3.5] survive. There are
only two such solutions (and ﬁnally, at the cut-oﬀ, only
one), resulting in a much less jagged spectrum between
arrows 3 and 4.

The classical trajectories directly emerge in the TDSE
quantum results if a time-frequency analysis is per-
formed. To that end a window is applied to the spec-
trum, selecting a certain frequency interval. The re-
sult is Fourier-transformed back, leading to a complex
quantity a(ω, t) containing information about when the

selected harmonics are emitted. The structures in the
time- and frequency-resolved radiated power |a(ω, t)|2 re-
veal the relevant classical “simple man’s” solutions. The
time-frequency analysis of the TAE-spectrum of Fig. 2 is
shown in Fig. 3. The relevant classical “simple man’s”
solutions are superimposed (analogous to Fig. 1). The re-
combination energies Er + I (1)
p of individual electrons are
drawn white. In the frequency intervals of interest, the
sum of the two classical highest return energies (plus the
ionization potentials) are superimposed in black. The ex-
cellent agreement between “simple man’s” and ab initio
quantum results shows that NSDR is indeed the mecha-
nism behind the second plateau.

The remainder of this Letter is devoted to the con-
trol of the NSDR process with the goal to enhance its
eﬃciency. Using the classical analysis above, the two rel-
evant emission times contributing to NSDR at a given
energy are readily calculated. In the case of the 6-cycle
sin2-pulse one ﬁnds for, e.g., the NSDR cut-oﬀ energy,
that the ﬁrst electron should be emitted at t1 = 1.52T
and the second at t2 = 2.54T . They then have the high-
est probability to both recombine at tr = 3.2T with the
highest possible joint return energy 5.55 Up (see Fig. 3).
In the following we call this scenario “setup 1”. Instead,
if t1 = 2.01T is chosen the return energy 4.70 Up is fa-
vored (“setup 2”). The ionization probability at the de-
sired times ti, i = 1, 2 may be enhanced by applying
xuv attosecond pulses centered around these times. In
order to avoid any excess energy immediately after ion-
ization ωi = I (i)
p was chosen for the two xuv frequen-
cies ωi. Hence, assuming a vanishing initial velocity in
the “simple man’s” analysis is still appropriate, and the
trajectories themselves do not—but only their weights—

change. For ﬁxing the ionization times very precisely, the
xuv pulses should be as short as possible. However, in
actual calculations one has to ﬁnd a compromise: if the
duration of the xuv pulses is chosen too short, the wings
of their Fourier-transform [which enters the calculation
of a(ω)] may mask the NSDR-plateau [19].

Figure 4 shows the HOHG spectra obtained for setups
1 and 2. The simulation parameters are given in the cap-
tion. The comparison with the result of Fig. 2 (included
in black) shows that the “usual” plateau is mainly modi-
ﬁed around ω1/ω = 15.5, ω2/ω = 34.2, and in the cut-oﬀ
region. In the latter, the He+-cut-oﬀ (arrow 2) is much
more pronounced than without xuv pulses. However, the
average level of the ﬁrst plateau is not aﬀected by the
xuv pulses (see, e.g., the harmonics around Ω/ω ≃ 80).
Instead, the second plateau due to NSDR is enhanced by
a factor ≃ 103 for both setup 1 and 2, showing that the
control schemes devised above work. Due to the width of
the xuv pulses the NSDR plateau is ampliﬁed in a broad
energy interval. However, it is clearly seen that setup 1
enhances the NSDR plateau up to the cut-oﬀ (arrow 4)
while setup 2 is restricted to lower photon energies, as it
is expected from the considerations above.

In conclusion, the existence of nonsequential double re-
combination in intense laser ﬁelds was revealed. In this
process, two electrons are freed by the laser, move in the
continuum, and are driven back to the ion by the laser,
where they recombine together upon emission of their
joint energy plus their ionization potentials as a single
photon. Nonsequential double recombination may thus
be viewed as the inverse process of single photon double
ionization. Clearly, in either direction the process re-
quires electron correlation. Nonsequential double recom-
bination manifests itself in a second plateau in high-order
harmonic generation spectra. This was demonstrated
by solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation of a
two-electron model atom numerically. The main features
of the harmonic spectra, including the position of the new
cut-oﬀ, were explained in terms of classical trajectories.
Moreover, it was shown how the rather low eﬃciency of
the process may be enhanced by aiding the desired ion-
ization times with the help of xuv attosecond pulses. We
did not aim at exhausting the optimum enhancement.
It is well possible that more sophisticated choices of the
xuv pulses’ parameters exist that increase the nonsequen-
tial double recombination-eﬃciency further. Finally, it
should be noted that, instead of simultaneous recombina-
tion, the two returning electrons may undergo elastic or
inelastic (2e, ne)-scattering processes such as, e.g., non-
sequential ionization involving 2 + n electrons or higher-
order above-threshold ionization.

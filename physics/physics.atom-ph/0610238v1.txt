We present an investigation on the resonances of a doubly excited helium atom in a strong
magnetic ﬁeld covering the regime B = 0 − 100 a.u. A full-interaction approach which is based
on an anisotropic Gaussian basis set of one-particle functions being nonlinearly optimized for each
ﬁeld strength is employed. Accurate results for a total of 17 resonances below the threshold of
consisting of He+ in the N = 2 state are reported in this work. This includes states with total
magnetic quantum numbers M = 0, −1, −2 and even z-parity. The corresponding binding energies
are compared to approximate energies of two-particle conﬁgurations consisting of two hydrogen-
like electrons in the strong ﬁeld regime, thereby providing an understanding of the behavior of the
energies of the resonances with varying ﬁeld strength.

INTRODUCTION

During the last years the number of observed mag-
netic white dwarfs (MWD) with magnetic ﬁeld strengths
B between a few and 105 Tesla has grown rapidly. In-
cluding the ESO [1] and SDSS [2, 3] surveys there are
about 170 MWD detected [4] and cataloged [44]. Even
stronger ﬁelds have been found in the vicinity of neutron
stars (B ≈ 107 − 109 T) [5]. Therefore, the behavior and
properties of matter exposed to strong magnetic ﬁelds is
of immediate interest.
In this context, atomic physics
plays a major role with respect to analyzing the atmo-
spheres of these astronomical objects. Spectra resulting
from theoretical investigations are a key ingredient in or-
der to identify atomic (or molecular) species in the atmo-
spheres of MWD. Beyond this they allow to gain infor-
mation on the magnetic ﬁeld strength and its landscape
of the object under investigation.

Most of the literature on atoms in strong magnetic
ﬁelds deals with the hydrogen atom which has also
become a paradigm for a low-dimensional chaotic sys-
tem [6]. Already in the 1930s it was studied employ-
ing perturbation theory in the low ﬁeld regime (B .
2 · 103 T) [7] and later on also in the high ﬁeld regime.
But it was not until 1984 that exact energies of the
hydrogen atom for the complete magnetic ﬁeld range
0 ≤ B . 5 · 108 T were available [8, 9, 10]. The cal-
culation of accurate extensive data was made possible by
the advent of supercomputers. It was the accuracy and
completeness of this new quantum mechanical data which
permitted, after 40 years of speculation, an understand-
ing of the mysterious absorption features in the spectrum

of the MWD Grw+70◦8247. They could be explained in
1985 as a hydrogen spectrum in a magnetic ﬁeld with a
polar value of 3.2 · 104 T [11, 12, 13]. In the following
decades a great number of MWD with the same type of
spectrum have been identiﬁed [13].

In spite of this great success, there were also spectra
of MWD which could not be explained in terms of hy-
drogen lines. Therefore, also results of atoms with more
than one electron are needed. Ten years ago the knowl-
edge about atoms with more than one electron in strong
magnetic ﬁelds was still very sparse. Even in the case of
two-electron atoms the investigations covered only much
smaller parts of the spectrum compared to the case of
the hydrogen atom, and their accuracy was considerably
poorer. At the end of the 1990s, suﬃciently accurate and
extensive data for the helium atom in the magnetic ﬁeld
regime 0 ≤ B ≤ 2.35 · 107 T [14, 15, 16, 17] and later
also for 2.35 · 107 T ≤ B ≤ 2.35 · 109 T [18] emerged.
These data consist exclusively of bound-state properties
and the corresponding transitions.

Employing these data,

it is possible to identify as-
tronomical spectra of strongly magnetized helium atmo-
spheres. In particular the interpretation of the absorp-
tion features in the spectrum of the MWD GD 229, one
of the major remaining mysteries for more than 25 years,
could be solved. It was the ﬁrst high-ﬁeld MWD with an
identiﬁed helium atmosphere [19].

Nevertheless, the spectra of several MWD with an
estimated hydrogen or helium atmosphere show major
absorption features that remain unexplained. There
were indications to explain the unresolved features with
bound-free and free-free transitions but also with spectral
components of heavier elements or of ions. However, the
literature concerning these topics is comparably sparse.
In order to shed light on this issue there were eﬀorts to
calculate bound-free opacities for the hydrogen atom [20].
More recently, extensive and accurate calculations on the
bound state spectrum of heavier elements like lithium [21]

and beryllium [22] in strong magnetic ﬁelds have been
accomplished. However, these newer results have not
been able to explain the unresolved absorption features
in question.

In view of the above it is of particular interest to ex-
plore the doubly excited states, i.e., the resonances of
helium in strong magnetic ﬁelds, which have not been
considered to date in the literature. It is the aim of this
work to provide a step towards the understanding of dou-
bly excited helium atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds and to
provide the ﬁrst data for the corresponding resonances.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section II we
introduce the Hamiltonian and discuss its symmetries.
III we report on our computational approach
In Sec.
and the employed optimized basis set. Sec.
IV begins
with a comparison of calculated resonance energies with
the literature in the well-known ﬁeld-free case. Subse-
quently the resonance energies and their behavior for
diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld strengths are presented and dis-
cussed. The dominant conﬁgurations contributing to the
resonances are identiﬁed allowing us to interprete them.
Additionally, the widths of selected resonances are stud-
ied with increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength.

II. HAMILTONIAN AND SYMMETRIES

Our investigation is carried out under the assumption
of an inﬁnite nuclear mass. However, by exploiting a
pseudo-separation of the center-of-mass motion in a mag-
netic ﬁeld [23, 24, 25] a scaling law can be derived which
allows one to translate the data for ﬁxed nucleus into
results with a ﬁnite nuclear mass under the assumption
of a vanishing pseudomomentum (see ref. [14] and refs.
therein). The ﬁnite nuclear mass eﬀects have certainly
to be taken into account in the high ﬁeld regime [18].
However, in this work we focus on the intermediate ﬁeld
regime and can therefore safely neglect the corresponding
considerations.

Assuming the magnetic ﬁeld B to point in the posi-
tive z-direction and for the ﬁeld strength B = |B|, our
Hamiltonian reads (atomic units are used throughout the
paper)

the electron spin g-factor, here taken to be equal to 2, we
refer the reader to [10, 14].

There exist four independent quantities commuting
with the Hamiltonian (1)the z-component Sz of the to-
tal spin, the z-component Lz of the total orbital angular
momentum and the total spatial z-parity Πz. Therefore,
the following investigations take place in a subspace of a
speciﬁed symmetry, i.e. with given eigenvalues of S2, Sz,
Lz and Πz. Furthermore, we will denote the calculated
states by the magnetic ﬁeld spectroscopic notation

N ν 2S+1 M Πz ,

(2)

where 2S + 1 is the spin multiplicity, M the eigenvalue
of Lz and ν = 1, 2, 3 . . . denotes the degree of excitation
within a given symmetry subspace, whereas N represents
the excitation of the ”inner” electron. The latter is not
an exact quantum number but a helpful spectroscopic
label within an independent-particle picture.

III. COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH

The Schr¨odinger equation is solved by applying a full
conﬁguration-interaction (full CI) approach. For our cal-
culations we use an anisotropic Gaussian basis set which
has been put forward by Schmelcher and Cederbaum [26]
for the purpose of investigating atoms and molecules
in strong magnetic ﬁelds. This one-particle basis set
has been successfully applied to several atoms, ions and
molecules [14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 30]. The
basis functions are optimized for each ﬁeld strength and
each symmetry separately using a nonlinear optimization
procedure described in efs. [14, 18]. A two-particle basis
set within a subspace (M, Πz) is constructed by select-
ing conﬁgurations of two optimized one-particle orbitals
respecting the symmetries. The full CI approach leads
to a generalized eigenvalue problem in which all matrix
elements can be calculated analytically and evaluated ef-
ﬁciently [14, 15]. Further technical aspects are discussed
in refs. [14, 18, 29].

For the investigation in this paper we use the complex-
scaling or complex-rotation method. This means that
all spatial coordinates r in the Hamiltonian are for-
mally replaced with reiθ (cf. [31, 32]). This leads to
a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with complex eigenvalues
W = E − i
2 Γ with the energy E and resonance width Γ
and to a complex-symmetric matrix representation. The
energies of the bound states are unaﬀected by this trans-
formation, while the diﬀerent continua are rotated about
their respective thresholds by the angle −2θ from the
real axis into the complex energy plane. The hidden res-
onances of the Hamiltonian in the continuum, associated
with complex eigenvalues W , are revealed if a suﬃciently
large value of θ is chosen.

It is one major advantage of the complex-scaling
method that the sophisticated numerical code developed
for bound atom systems can be directly ’translated’ to
the case of unbound resonances. However, the complex

eigenvalues W of the resonances are only independent of
the rotation angle θ if the basis set is complete, which is
not the case in any approximate numerical investigation.
Therefore, the rotated Hamiltonian has to be calculated
for diﬀerent values of θ. The complex variational theorem
and the complex Hellmann-Feynman theorem provide a
criterion for choosing an optimum resonance parameter
θ within a given basis set [33]:

dW (θ)
dθ

(3)

= 0.

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)θopt
To ﬁnd that optimum θopt ∈ C, one thus has to vary the
imaginary part of θ, too. This can be interpreted as a
real scaling parameter of the wave functions. Obviously,
the criterion (3) is only fulﬁlled approximately since we
can only calculate ﬁnite diﬀerences between eigenvalues
belonging to Hamiltonians with a diﬀerent value of the
rotation angle θ.

In our investigation the diagonalization of the rotated
Hamiltonian is carried out for about 50 to 80 diﬀerent
values of θ. The used basis-set size varies from 4000 to
6000 two-particle conﬁgurations. This results in a com-
putational eﬀort of approximately 30 to 200 hours CPU
time on a powerful PC for each magnetic ﬁeld strength
and symmetry subspace.

IV. RESULTS

In principle, one distinguishes two kinds of excitations
of the helium atom using the independent-particle pic-
ture. On the one hand, there are the single excitations
of the helium atom. Their ”inner” electron occupies pre-
dominantly the one-particle ground state of He+. The
second ”outer” electron carries, like a hydrogenic elec-
tron, the angular momentum alone. All bound states are
of this kind. On the other hand, there are the doubly ex-
cited helium states where the ”inner” electron is excited,
too. They appear as resonances in the continuum of the
singly excited helium states. The degree of the ”inner”
and ”outer” excitation is denoted by N with N = 1, 2, . . .
and by n with n ≥ N , respectively. States with the same
”inner” excitation N form Rydberg series converging en-
ergetically to the threshold IN . These thresholds corre-
spond to the energies of an excited helium ion He+ in the
N -th energy level.

A. Resonances in the ﬁeld-free case

Doubly excited (DE) helium has been an active re-
search topic for the last 40 years, both from the numer-
ical and analytical standpoint (cf. review [34]). Major
contributions to the calculation of the energy levels were
provided by, e.g., B¨urgers et al. (S-states) [35], Ho et
al. (P- and D-states) [36, 37] or Bachau (N = 3 states)
[38]. However, the data have not reached the same ac-
curacy and completeness compared with the literature of

3

singly excited helium. DE helium is considered as a stan-
dard model for a strongly correlated system. We use the
standard notation i.e. the correlation quantum numbers
introduced by Herrick, Sinano˘glu [39] and Lin [40]:

2S+1LΠ

N (K, T )A
n .

(4)

Here L is the total angular momentum, and K and T
represent angular and A radial correlations.

However, the focus of this paper lies on the interaction
of the atomic system with a strong magnetic ﬁeld. For
a ﬁnite ﬁeld strength the correlation quantum numbers
(4) lose their meaning. Therefore, it is instructive to
consider the correspondence between the magnetic ﬁeld
spectroscopic notation (2) and the ﬁeld-free one (4) which
is done for the states studied here in table I.

Table II provides the relative accuracy of our calcu-
lated energies E and decay widths Γ for the energetically
lowest resonances in the absence of the ﬁeld. The com-
parison was performed with the corresponding high pre-
cision results available in the literature [35, 36, 37, 41].
Generally it has to be remarked that for the states consid-
ered here, the absolute values of the energies are signiﬁ-
cantly larger than the values of the corresponding widths.
The accuracy of our results is consequently much higher
for the energies compared to the widths. Except for the
states 3 10+ and 4 3(±1)+ all calculated energies possess
a relative accuracy in the range of 7.5 · 10−4 to 2 · 10−5.
Obviously our approach is not best-suited to describe
the resonances in the absence of the external ﬁeld i.e.
cannot compete with the best methods available in the
literature based e.g. on a Hylleraas basis. However, our
focus is to provide ﬁrst results on resonances in strong
magnetic ﬁelds and in this case our anisotropic Gaus-
sian basis set is certainly superior to existing ﬁeld-free
methods that cannot eﬃciently describe the pronounced
anisotropy present in a strong ﬁeld. This reﬂects itself
also in the diﬀerent symmetries for B = 0 and B 6= 0.

B. Resonances in a magnetic ﬁeld

1. Dependence of the resonance energies on M and Sz

The Zeeman term of the Hamiltonian (1) depends lin-
early on Lz and remains unchanged when the complex
rotation is applied. Using eigenfunctions of Lz, as it is
done here, one arrives at

hi|TZeeman(M )|ji = hi| 1

2 LzB|ji =

M BSij ,

1
2

with Sij being the overlap matrix of the two-particle
states |ii and |ji. The relation between two matrix el-
ements associated with diﬀerent signs of the magnetic
quantum number M reads as follows

hi|TZeeman(−M )|ji = hi|TZeeman(M )|ji − M BSij.

i.e. we obtain a shift. A similar argument holds for Sz,

hi|TSpin(Sz)|ji = hi|SzB|ji = SzBSij .

In combination, the relation for the dependence of the
complex energy W on M and Sz can be put in the fol-
lowing way:

W (M, Sz) = W (−M, Sz = 0) + M B + SzB.

(5)

In what follows, we only present results for states belong-
ing to subspaces with M ≤ 0 and Sz = 0. All energies
of subspaces with M > 0 and Sz 6= 0 are just shifted by
a real energy term and can be calculated with the help
of (5). Note that the resonance widths do not depend on
Sz and the sign of M .

2. Resonance energies

The results of our calculations include the energies of
the energetically lowest resonance states of the subspaces
with M = 0, −1, −2, Πz = +1, Sz = 0 and S = 0, 1. The
values of the magnetic ﬁeld strength are spread over a
logarithmic scale covering the range B = 0 − 100 a.u.
(B = 0 − 2.35 · 107 T). The resulting data are given in
the tables IV to IX.

The minimal energy of a single free electron (m ≤ 0)
in a magnetic ﬁeld is Ee−(B) = B/2 (cf. Landau en-
ergy [42]). Therefore, the minimal energy of two non-
interacting free electrons that possess no kinetic energy

along the magnetic ﬁeld is E2e−(B) = B, which corre-
sponds to the double ionization threshold of helium with
a ﬁxed nucleus in a magnetic ﬁeld. In order to get the
binding energies Ebin(B) of the helium states, this energy
E2e−(B) has to be subtracted from the total energies:

Ebin(B) = E(B) − E2e−(B) = E(B) − B.

(6)

Figure 1 shows the binding energies for the resonance
states belonging to the subspaces M = 0 (a) and M = −1
(b). The absolute values of the binding energies increase
with increasing ﬁeld strength for all resonant states con-
sidered here. The rate of increase, however, is larger
for the resonances belonging to the symmetry subspace
M = −1. Additionally, the binding energies of the He+
ions EHe+ (B) emerging from the ﬁeld-free quantum num-
ber n = 2 and magnetic quantum numbers m = 0 (a) and
m = −1 (b) are shown. The total energies EHe+,tot(B) of
He+ in a magnetic ﬁeld can be obtained via a scaling rela-
tion [10] from the precisely known energies of hydrogen in
a magnetic ﬁeld [10, 43]. In order to get the binding en-
ergies EHe+ (B) of the He+ ion (similar as in (6)), Ee−(B)
has to be subtracted from the total energies EHe+,tot(B):

EHe+ (B) = EHe+,tot(B) − Ee− (B) = EHe+,tot(B) − B/2.

One observes that the binding energies of He+(2p0) and
He+(2p−1) correspond to upper thresholds for Ebin(B)
of the calculated states with M = 0 (a) and M = −1

degree of excitation ν within a given symmetry subspace (cf.
table I).

(b), respectively [45], and they show the same qualita-
tive behavior as the energies Ebin(B) of our resonances
with increasing ﬁeld strength. This can be interpreted
in the following way: as a rough approximation one, of
the electrons of the DE helium occupies the correspond-
ing orbital of the He+ ion mentioned above. In order to
analyze the behavior of the second electron we subtract
from the binding energies of the DE helium atoms the
corresponding He+ energy EHe+ (B):

E2(M, B) = Ebin(M, B) − EHe+ (2pM , B).

Corresponding results are shown in ﬁgure 2. One ob-
serves a qualitatively diﬀerent behavior of the energy
levels according to three diﬀerent regimes: I) low ﬁeld
regime 0 ≤ B ≤ 10−2, II) intermediate ﬁeld regime
10−2 < B ≤ 1 and III) high ﬁeld regime 1 < B ≤ 102.
Especially in I) but also in III) there is a comparatively
weak dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld. On the other
hand in II) a reorganization of the energy levels takes
place being most pronounced in ﬁgure 2a. This behavior
is also known for hydrogen and singly excited helium in a
magnetic ﬁeld. In both subﬁgures three additional ener-
gies are shown (- -). These approximate energies Eapp(B)
are the sum of the binding energy EHe+(2p mHe+ )(B) of
the helium ion He+(2p0) (a), He+(2p−1) (b) and the en-
ergetically lowest binding energies EH(nlmH)(B) of the

FIG. 2: Diﬀerences of the binding energies of the doubly ex-
cited helium atom and the He+ ion Ebin(B) − EHe+ (B) in a
magnetic ﬁeld range 0.0002 ≤ B ≤ 100. The dependence on
the magnetic ﬁeld is shown for the energetically lowest states
of the subspaces M = 0 Πz = +1 (a) and M = −1 Πz = +1
(b). Solid lines (—) stand for singlet and dotted lines (· · · ) for
triplet states. Additionally to Ebin(B), approximate energies
are given (- -) which are a sum of the binding energies of a
He+ ion and a hydrogen atom (see text for details).

in ﬁgure 2b one can see that in the high ﬁeld regime III)
the energies Eapp(B) come energetically close to the cal-
culated resonance energies and show the same qualitative
behavior. In this regime also a degeneracy of the singlet
(—) and triplet (· · · ) states takes place (only Sz = 0
is considered here). These features become more pro-
nounced with increasing ﬁeld strength and higher degree
of excitation (logarithmic scale!). Let us concentrate as
an example on the approximation Eapp(He+(2p−1) H(2s0))
to the energies of the singlet and triplet ground states 11(−1)+
and 13(−1)+, respectively. It obviously signiﬁcantly underes-
timates the magnitude of their binding energies in the ﬁeld
regime I) and II) where both states are also energetically sig-

6

niﬁcantly separated. This is a sign for the strong overlap of
the two electrons of the DE helium. This overlap decreases in
the region III) and the electrons become spatially separated.
Therefore, it is possible in III) to speak of an ”inner” He+-like
electron, which is located close to the nucleus and screens one
charge unit and of an ”outer” H-like electron at a distance
noticing only one eﬀective positive charge.

The above-observed behavior can be illustrated by using
an independent-particle picture. All one-electron states ex-
cept the tightly bound states are elongated along the mag-
netic ﬁeld axis and squeezed perpendicular to it with increas-
ing magnetic ﬁeld strength. Tightly bound states (1s0, 2p−1,
3d−2, . . .) are conﬁned parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld axis as
well, and their binding energy rises strongly with increasing
ﬁeld strength [10]. In case that one of the electrons occupies
a tightly bound orbital, the overlap of two electrons steadily
decreases with increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength. Thus the
tightly bound electron is located close to the nucleus screen-
ing one charge, while the second electron stays mainly near
the z-axis at a distance to the core and behaves therefore sim-
ilar to an electron of a hydrogen atom. This scenario applies
to the subspace M = −1 Πz = +1 since 2p−1 is a tightly
bound orbital and consequently all other possible orbitals of
the second electron are not tightly bound.

In the subspace M = 0 in ﬁgure 2a no degeneracy of the
energies of the singlet and triplet states occurs in the pres-
ence of a strong ﬁeld. However, the singlet states can be well
approximated by the corresponding Eapp(B). An exception
to this rule is the ground state 11(0)+, which is approximated
only qualitatively by the binding energies of He+(2p0) and
H(2p0), which corresponds to an intrashell state. In an in-
trashell state with both electrons approximately in the same
orbital, it is expected that the assumption of weakly inter-
acting electrons fails. Of course, there is no triplet partner
for the ground state which is approximately described by the
symmetric (2p0)2 conﬁguration. In contrast to the subspace
M = −1 the resonances of the subspace M = 0 contain no
(dominating) conﬁgurations that include a tightly bound or-
bital. As a consequence also the ”inner” He+-like electron
is elongated along the z-axis and a noticeable overlap of the
electronic orbitals remains even in the strong ﬁeld regime III).
The strong increase of some energies in the regime 0.1 ≤
B ≤ 1 (see ﬁgures 2a and 2b) can be partly modeled with
two-electron conﬁgurations that consist of an electronic wave
function of a helium ion He+(2s0) and a hydrogen atom and
are not shown in ﬁgure 2. This eﬀect results from the increas-
ing energetic gap between the binding energy of He+(2s0) and
He+(2p0) which can be seen in ﬁgure 1a. Note that the ap-
proximations applied in the strong magnetic ﬁeld regime III)
do not hold in the regimes I) and II) and particularly not in
the ﬁeld-free situation [40].

As a next step we aim at investigating the energetically low-
est DE helium state in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, we
searched for the DE helium state with the strongest binding
energy in the ﬁeld range III). The latter is dominated by the
conﬁguration He+(2p−1) H(2p−1) [10]. Consequently we cal-
culated the energetically lowest singlet states of the subspace
M = −2 and Πz = +1.

In ﬁgure 3 the energetic distances of the two energeti-
cally lowest singlet states to the ﬁrst ionization threshold
I1(B) = EHe+(1s0)(B) + B are shown. The energies of both
states show a weak dependence on the ﬁeld strength for
B < 0.01. For B > 0.01 the energetic diﬀerence of the ener-
getically lowest resonance state 11(−2)+ to I1(B) decreases

3. Resonance widths

with increasing ﬁeld strength. A crossover of the ﬁrst ion-
ization threshold seems to take place for B ≈ 65 a.u. This
would correspond to a stabilization of the resonance 11(−2)+
and a conversion to a bound state for a magnetic ﬁeld B > 65
since the autoionization process is not possible anymore. The
energetically lowest resonance is approximated only qualita-
tively by the conﬁguration involving the non-interacting or-
bitals He+(2p−1) and H(2p−1), for it is an intrashell state
which consists of two tightly bound orbitals. We note that
the above considerations assume a spin singlet for both the
resonance and the threshold state, which is indeed not the
energetically lowest state in the strong ﬁeld regime.

The second singlet state 21(−2)+ is approximated well by
the conﬁguration involving the orbitals He+(2p−1), H(3p−1)
and for B > 1 there is hardly a diﬀerence visible on the scale
of ﬁgure 3. This can be explained by applying the same ar-
gument as for the subspace M = −1 where all calculated
states also consist approximately of a tightly bound and a
non-tightly bound orbital. However, the energetic diﬀerence
to I1(B) increases strongly in the high ﬁeld regime and no
crossing of I1(B) is possible.

Using the results which have been obtained so far one can
relate the doubly excited helium states in a magnetic ﬁeld
denoted by the spectroscopic ﬁeld notation (2) in the limit
of a high ﬁeld strength to the corresponding dominant inde-
pendent particle conﬁgurations of a helium ion and hydrogen
electron. This has been done in table III. In addition, the cor-
responding correlation quantum numbers (4) for a vanishing
magnetic ﬁeld B = 0 are given.

Parallel to the real energies dealt with in subsection IV B 2,
the corresponding imaginary parts Γ have been calculated,
too. Γ is interpreted as the width of the resonance and there-
fore as the inverse lifetime. Typically, the absolute values of
the widths are by orders of magnitude smaller than the real
energies. Our method allows for the same absolute accuracy
for both the real and the imaginary part. This leads to a
signiﬁcantly lower relative accuracy of the resonance widths
compared to the real energies. The widths themselves vary
by orders of magnitudes. Therefore, it is most natural to in-
spect the behavior of those widths more closely which possess
a large absolute value (Γ/2 ≥ 0.0001). These include three
singlet states of the M = 0 Πz = +1 subspace 110+, 210+
and 410+, which are shown in ﬁgure 4a. Additionally, the
widths of the two energetically lowest resonance states of the
M = −1 Πz = +1 subspace, 11(−1)+ and 13(−1)+, are pre-
sented in ﬁgure 4b. The corresponding data can be found in
the tables IV, V, VII and VIII.

For B < 0.05 just a weak dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld
can be observed for the three singlet states in ﬁgure 4a. With
further increasing ﬁeld strength, the widths start to ﬂuctuate,
although this ﬂuctuation could possibly be a consequence of
the ﬁnite numerical accuracy. The width of the state 110+
increases in the regime 1 < B < 2 approximately by a factor
of 4.

In ﬁgure 4b we compare a singlet and a triplet state oth-
erwise possessing the same quantum numbers. In ﬁgure 2b
we have seen that the energies of these states become degen-
erate for B > 2. For B < 0.1 their widths ﬂuctuate around
a mean value of 7 · 10−4 (11(−1)+) and 1.5 · 10−4 (13(−1)+),
respectively. For B > 0.1 the width of the triplet state keeps

the magnetic ﬁeld strength B. This means that both states
become energetically degenerate for strong magnetic ﬁelds,
but the behavior of the corresponding resonance widths is
diﬀerent in this ﬁeld range.

V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

We have investigated the energies and lifetimes of the res-
onance states of a doubly excited helium atom exposed to a
magnetic ﬁeld. The nonrelativistic, inﬁnite-mass Hamiltonian
is characterized by the symmetries associated with the four
quantum numbers: M , Πz, S 2 and Sz. Our computational

(a)

approach consists of the complex scaling method applied to
a full conﬁguration-interaction scheme based on nonlinearly
optimized anisotropic Gaussian orbitals.

In order to show the behavior of the DE helium states de-
noted by the spectroscopic ﬁeld notation (2) in the limits of
weak and strong magnetic ﬁeld strength, we have presented
for vanishing magnetic ﬁeld their corresponding correlation
quantum numbers (4) and for a strong magnetic ﬁeld their
corresponding independent-particle conﬁgurations of a helium
ion and hydrogen electron.

In total the energies of 17 DE states have been calcu-
lated. Their behavior can be subdivided into three magnetic
ﬁeld ranges: the weak (0 ≤ B ≤ 10−2), the intermediate
(10−2 < B ≤ 1) and the strong (1 < B ≤ 102) ﬁeld regime.
With increasing ﬁeld strength we observe the transition from
a weak to a strong dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld which is
accompanied by a reorganization of the energies of the reso-
nances especially in the intermediate ﬁeld regime.

In the strong ﬁeld regime, a clustering of the calculated
energies into diﬀerent branches according to their magnetic
quantum numbers takes place. Furthermore, the electron-
electron interaction becomes less important with increasing
ﬁeld strength, being more pronounced for the states of the
subspace M = −1 than for those of M = 0. As a result, a
crude description of the resonance energies by the sum of the
energies of a He+ ion and a hydrogen atom is possible. An
exception to this rule are the intrashell states. The DE helium
state with the lowest energy (Sz = 0) is the state 11(−2)+ of
the subspace M = −2. This resonance state can probably
be stabilized by a magnetic ﬁeld, for its calculated energy
becomes smaller than the one-electron ionization threshold
for a ﬁeld strength of B > 65.

The behavior of the widths of ﬁve calculated resonances
with great absolute value (Γ & 10−4) has been inspected. The
dependence of the widths on the magnetic ﬁeld for low ﬁeld
strengths B < 0.1 is weak. The values of the widths are ﬂuc-
tuating around their mean values, which could be due to the
ﬁnite numerical accuracy of our method. For ﬁeld strengths
B > 1 the widths of two states, namely 110+ and 11(−1)+,
signiﬁcantly increase while the widths of the other investi-
gated states still ﬂuctuate with an increasing amplitude.

Having presented the ﬁrst data on the energies of the res-
onances of DE helium in a magnetic ﬁeld, several issues still
have to be addressed in future works. In order to get synthetic
spectra of astronomical objects like MWD, the number of cal-
culated states should be increased including also states with
Πz = −1. Additionally, magnetic ﬁeld dependent oscillator
strengths and electromagnetic-transition probabilities have to
be studied. On the other hand, a closer look at the resonance
widths would be desirable in order to gain a deeper under-
standing of the role of electron-electron interactions and the
autoionization process under the inﬂuence of a magnetic ﬁeld.
An increased accuracy of our data would be a prerequisite for
this.

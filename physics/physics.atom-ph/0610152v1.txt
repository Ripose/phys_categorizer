Abstract

The present status of quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory of
heavy few-electron ions is reviewed. The theoretical results are com-
pared with available experimental data. A special attention is focused
on tests of QED at strong ﬁelds and on determination of the fun-
damental constants. A recent progress on calculations of the QED
corrections to the parity nonconserving 6s-7s transition amplitude in
neutral Cs is also discussed.

1 Introduction

Basic principles of quantum electrodynamics (QED) were formulated to the
beginning of 1930’s as the result of merging quantum mechanics and special
relativity. This theory provided description of such low-order processes as
emission and absorption of photons and creation and annihilation of electron-
positron pairs. However, application of this theory to calculations of some
higher-order eﬀects gave inﬁnite results. This problem remained unsolved
till the late of 1940’s, when Lamb and Retherford discovered the 2p1/2 − 2s
splitting in hydrogen, which is presently known as the Lamb shift. This
discovery stimulated theorists to complete the creation of QED since it was
believed that this splitting is of QED origin.

First evaluation of the Lamb shift was given by Bethe. The rigorous
QED formalism was developed by Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger and Tomon-
aga. They found that all divergences can be removed from the theory by the
renormalization procedure. All calculations in QED are based on the per-
turbation theory in a small parameter, which is the ﬁne structure constant
α ≈ 1/137. Individual terms of the perturbation series are conveniently rep-
resented by Feynman diagrams. For instance, the lowest-order contribution
to the Lamb shift in a H-like atom is determined by so-called self-energy and
vacuum-polarization diagrams, presented in Fig. 1.

Till the beginning of 1980’s tests of quantum electrodynamics were mainly
restricted to light atomic systems: hydrogen, helium, positronium, and muo-
nium. In these systems, in addition to α, there is another small parameter,
which is αZ (Z is the nuclear charge number). For this reason, calculations
of light atoms were based on expansion in these two parameters. It means
that with light atomic systems we can test QED only to few lowest orders in
the parameters α and αZ. A unique opportunuty to study QED eﬀects to
all orders in αZ appeared in experiments with heavy few-electron ions, such
as, for instance, H-like uranium or Li-like uranium. High-precision experi-
ments with these ions became possible in the last two decades [1]. In heavy
few-electron ions the number of electrons is much smaller than the nuclear
charge number. For this reason, to the zeroth-order approximation, we can
neglect the interelectronic interaction and consider that the electrons interact
only with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus. The interelectronic-interaction
and QED eﬀects are accounted for by perturbation theory in the parameters

2

1/Z and α, respectively [2, 3]. For very heavy ions the parameter 1/Z be-
comes comparable with α and, therefore, all contributions can be classiﬁed
by the parameter α. But, in contrast to light atoms, the parameter αZ is no
longer small. It means that all calculations must be performed without any
expansion in the parameter αZ.

2 Binding energy in heavy ions

2.1 H-like ions

To the zeroth-order approximation, a hydrogenlike ion is described by the
Dirac equation with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus (¯h = c = 1):

(α · p + βm + VC(r))ψ(r) = Eψ(r) .

(1)

For the point-charge nucleus, VC(r) = −αZ/r, this equation can be solved
[2, 3]). To get the binding energy to a higher
analytically (see, e.g., Refs.
accuracy we need to evaluate quantum electrodynamic and nuclear correc-
tions.

The ﬁnite-nuclear-size correction is evaluated by solving the Dirac equa-
tion with the potential induced by an extended nuclear charge-density distri-
bution and taking the diﬀerence between the energies for the extended and
point-charge nucleus. This can be done either numerically (see, e.g., Ref.
[4]) or analytically [5]. In contrast to the nonrelativistic case, where the cor-
responding correction is completely deﬁned by the root-mean-square nuclear
radius hr2i1/2, in heavy ions the higher-order moments of the nuclear charge
distribution may aﬀect the nuclear-size correction on a 1% accuracy level.

The QED corrections of ﬁrst order in α are determined by the self-energy
(SE) and vacuum-polarization (VP) diagrams (Fig. 1a,b). High-precision
calculation of the SE diagram to all orders in αZ was performed by Mohr [6]
while the VP diagram was ﬁrst evaluated by Soﬀ and Mohr [7] and by Man-
akov et al. [8]. Nowadays calculation of these diagrams causes no problem.
The QED corrections of second order in α are determined by diagrams
depicted in Fig. 2. Most of these diagrams can be evaluated by adopting the
methods developed for the ﬁrst-order SE and VP corrections [2]. The most
diﬃcult task consists in evaluation of the SE-SE diagrams and the combined

3

Figure 2: Two-loop one-electron Feynman diagrams.

SE-VP diagrams presented in the last row of Fig. 2. The whole gauge-
invariant set of the SE-SE diagrams was calculated in Ref.
[9]. As to the
combined SE-VP diagrams mentioned above, to date they have been evalu-
ated only in the free-electron-loop approximation (see Ref. [2] and references
therein).

Next, one should consider the nuclear recoil eﬀect. It is known that in
the nonrelativistic theory of a hydrogenlike atom the nuclear recoil eﬀect can
easily be taken into account using the reduced electron mass, µ = mM/(m +
M), where M is the nuclear mass. But this is not the case in the relativistic
theory. The full relativistic theory of the recoil eﬀect can be formulated only
in the framework of QED. For a hydrogenlike ion, a closed expression for the
recoil eﬀect to ﬁrst order in m/M accounting for the complete αZ-dependence
was derived in Ref. [10] (see also Ref. [11] and references therein). Numerical
evaluation of this expression to all orders in αZ was performed in Ref. [12].
Finally, one should take into account the nuclear polarization correction,
which sets the ultimate accuracy limit up to which QED can be tested with
heavy ions. This correction is determined by the electron-nucleus interac-
tion diagrams in which the intermediate nuclear states are excited. It was
evaluated in Refs. [13, 14].

The individual contributions to the ground-state Lamb shift in 238U91+,
which is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the exact binding energy and the
binding energy derived from the Dirac equation for the point-charge nucleus,
are given in Table 1. The ﬁnite-nuclear-size correction is evaluated for the
Fermi model of the nuclear charge distribution with hr2i1/2 = 5.8507(72) fm
[15]. The uncertainty of this correction is estimated by adding quadratically
two errors, one obtained by varying the root-mean-square radius and the
other obtained by changing the model of the nuclear-charge distribution from
the Fermi to the homogeneously-charged-sphere model. According to the
table, the present status of the theory and experiment on the ground-state
Lamb shift in 238U91+ provides a test of QED on the level of about 2%.

2.2 Li-like ions

To date, the highest accuracy was achieved in experiments with heavy Li-like
ions [17, 18, 19]. In these systems, in addition to the one-electron contribu-
tions discussed above, one has to evaluate two- and three-electron contri-
butions. To ﬁrst order in α, the two-electron contribution is determined

by the one-photon exchange diagram whose calculation causes no problem.
To second order in α, one should consider the two-photon exchange dia-
grams and the self-energy and vacuum-polarization screening diagrams. Ac-
curate evaluations of these diagrams were accomplished by diﬀerent groups
[20].
In addition, to gain the required accuracy, we need to evaluate the
interelectronic-interaction corrections of third order in the parameter 1/Z.
The corresponding evaluation within the Breit approximation was performed
in Ref. [21].

The individual contributions to the 2p1/2 − 2s transition energy in Li-like
uranium are presented in Table 2. The Breit approximation value indicates
the transition energy which can be derived from the Breit equation. The
QED contribution of second order in α incorporates a recent result for the
two-loop SE contribution from Ref.
[22]. The total theoretical value of
the transition energy, 280.76(13) eV, agrees with the related experimental
value, 280.645(15) eV [19]. Comparing the ﬁrst- and second-order QED
contributions with the total theoretical uncertainty, we conclude that the
present status of the theory and experiment for Li-like uranium provides a
test of QED on a 0.3% level to ﬁrst order in α and on a 8% level to second
order in α.

3 Hyperﬁne splitting in heavy ions

To date, there are several high-precision measurements of the hyperﬁne split-
ting (HFS) in heavy hydrogenlike ions [23, 24, 25, 26]. The hyperﬁne splitting
of a hydrogenlike ion can be written as

∆E = ∆EDirac(1 − ε) + ∆EQED ,

eﬀects, ε is the nuclear magnetization distribution correction (so-called Bohr-
Weisskopf eﬀect), and ∆EQED is the QED correction. The most accurate

calculations of the QED correction were performed in Refs.
theoretical uncertainty is almost completely determined by the uncertainty
of the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) eﬀect. Table 3 presents the ground-state hy-
perﬁne splitting in 209Bi82+ obtained by diﬀerent methods. The theoretical
value based on the single-particle nuclear model [27] agrees well with the
experiment [23] but has a rather large uncertainty. The most elaborated
value obtained within a many-particle nuclear model [29] disagrees with the
experiment. A semiempirical evaluation employing the experimental value
for the HFS in muonic Bi [30] yields the value which deviates by 2σ from
the experiment. Since the QED correction is comparable with the uncer-
tainty due to the BW eﬀect, it is rather diﬃcult to test QED by the direct
comparison of the theory and experiment on the hyperﬁne splitting in heavy
H-like ions. However, it has been found that QED eﬀects on the HFS can
be tested by studying a speciﬁc diﬀerence of the ground-state HFS values in
H- and Li-like ions of the same isotope [31]. Namely, it was shown that the
diﬀerence

∆′E = ∆E(2s) − ξ∆E(1s) ,

(3)

where ∆E(1s) and ∆E(2s) are the HFS in H- and Li-like ions of the same
isotope, is very stable with respect to variations of the nuclear model, if
the parameter ξ is chosen to cancel the BW corrections in the right-hand
side of equation (3). The parameter ξ is almost independent of the nuclear

Bi, the calculations yield ξ = 0.16885 and ∆′E= −61.27(4) meV. The non-
QED and QED contributions amount to −61.52(4) meV and 0.24(1) meV,
respectively, and, therefore, the QED contribution is six times larger than
the current total theoretical uncertainty. This method has a potential to test
QED on level of a few percent, provided the HFS is measured to accuracy
∼ 10−6.

4 Bound-electron g-factor

The g-factor of an ion can be deﬁned as the ratio of the magnetic moment of
the ion to its mechanical moment, expressed in the Bohr magnetons. High-
precision measurements of the g factor of H-like carbon [32] and oxygen [33]
have triggered a great interest to related theoretical calculations (see Refs.
[34, 35, 36] and references therein). In particular, these studies provided a
new determination of the electron mass to an accuracy which is four times
better than that of the previously accepted value [37]. An extension of the
g-factor investigations to higher-Z ions could also lead to an independent
determination of the ﬁne structure constant α [38]. The accuracy of such
a determination is, however, strongly limited by a large uncertainty of the
nuclear structure eﬀects which strongly increases when Z is growing [39]. In
Ref. [40] it was shown that the ultimate accuracy limit can be signiﬁcantly
reduced in the diﬀerence

g′ = g[(1s)2(2s)22p1/2] − ξg[1s] ,

(4)

where g[(1s)2(2s)22p1/2] and g[1s] denote the g-factors of 208Pb77+ and 208Pb81+,
respectively. The parameter ξ must be chosen to cancel the nuclear size eﬀect
in this diﬀerence. In Ref. [40] it was shown that measurements of the g factor
of B- and H-like lead to the same accuracy as for carbon, accompanied by the
corresponding theoretical calculations, can provide a determination of α to a
higher acuracy than that from the recent compillation by Mohr and Taylor

8

[37]. This method can also compete in accuracy with the new determination
of α by Gabrielse and co-workers [41].

5 QED corrections to the 6s − 7s PNC tran-

sition amplitude in neutral 133Cs

The 6s − 7s PNC transition amplitude in neutral 133Cs [42] remains one
of the most attractive subject for tests of the standard model (SM) at low
energies. The measurement of this amplitude to a 0.3% accuracy [43] has
stimulated theorists to improve the related calculations. These improve-
ments, that included evaluations of the Breit interaction [44, 45], more pre-
cise calculations of the electron-correlation eﬀects [46], and calculation of the
vacuum-polarization part of the QED correction [47], gave the value for the
weak charge of the cesium nucleus, which deviates by 2σ from the prediction
of the standard model. This discrepancy urgently required calculations of
the self-energy part of the QED correction. Evaluation of the whole gauge-
invariant set of the SE corrections to the PNC transition amplitude with the
Dirac-Fock wave functions was performed in Ref. [48]. The total result for
the binding QED correction was found to amount to −0.27%. This value dif-
fers from the previous results for the total binding QED eﬀect, −0.5(1)% [49]
and −0.43(4)% [50]. The discrepency can be explained by some approxima-
tions made in the previos calculations. In particular, instead of calculating
the QED corrections to the PNC amplitude, the previous papers were dealing
with evaluation of the QED corrections to the PNC mixing coeﬃcient which
is a rather artiﬁcial subject for QED. However, a semiempirical revision of
the previous results [51] gave a value for the QED correction which is very
close to that of Ref. [48] .

Combining the QED correction with other theoretical contributions and
comparing the total PNC amplitude with the experiment for an average
value for the vector transition polarizabilty, β = 26.99(5)a3
[46]
and references therein), one obtains for the weak charge of 133Cs:

B (see Ref.

QW = −72.65(29)exp(36)th .

(5)

This value deviates from the SM prediction of −73.19(13) [52] by 1.1 σ.
Further progress on the PNC tests in 133Cs can be achieved either by more
accurate atomic structure calculations or by more precise measurements.

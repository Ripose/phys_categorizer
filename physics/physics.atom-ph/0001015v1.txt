We show that atomic interference in the reﬂection from two suitably polarized evanescent waves is
sensitive to retardation eﬀects in the atom–surface interaction for speciﬁc experimental parameters.
We study the limit of short and long atomic de Broglie wavelength. The former case is analyzed
in the semiclassical approximation (Landau-Zener model). The latter represents a quantum regime
and is analyzed by solving numerically the associated coupled Schr¨odinger equations. We consider
a speciﬁc experimental scheme and show the results for rubidium (short wavelength) and the much
lighter meta-stable helium atom (long wavelength). The merits of each case are then discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The interaction between a ground–state atom and a dielectric or conducting wall has been investigated theoretically
( [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]) and experimentally ( [11], [12], [13], [14]). Theoretical studies have been
performed on diﬀerent levels, from a simple model of a dipole–dipole interaction of the atom and its mirror image, to
the full QED relativistic quantum treatment. Interesting in particular are the long–range Casimir interactions [6] that
were recently observed in cavity QED experiments [13], [14]. When the atom–wall distance z is not small compared
to the wavelength of the dominant atomic transitions, the z−3 law associated with the instantaneous electrostatic
interaction is no longer valid. The full QED treatment leads to the famous long distance z−4 law.

Recent experimental developments enable precise manipulation of cold atoms by lasers, see e.g. Ref. [15]. Small and
well deﬁned velocities of the atoms can be achieved using advanced cooling and launching techniques and a detuned
laser ﬁeld can be used to create controlled and adjustable potentials for the atoms. Under these conditions, atoms
can be used to explore the atom–surface potential, for example using evanescent–wave mirrors. Classical reﬂection
from such an atomic mirror was used to measure the van der Waals force between a dielectric surface and an atom
in its ground state [11]. This experiment though, could not fully discriminate between the electrostatic and the QED
expressions. Segev et al. [16] considered a similar experiment in the quantum regime (atoms undergoing above–
barrier, classically forbidden reﬂection). Unlike classical reﬂection, which can only be used to identify thresholds and
to measure the height of the potential barrier, quantum probabilities are determined by the complete potential curve,
and are sensitive to the short- and long–range behavior of the potential. It was found that, for velocities of the order
of the recoil speed, the quantum reﬂection probabilities are indeed sensitive to the long–range (Casimir) interaction.
In this work we study how the form of the atom–surface interaction can be observed using atomic interference of
the type reported in [17]. We consider atoms with multiple ground state sub-levels, which feel diﬀerent potentials
in the evanescent radiation ﬁeld. These potentials can be probed by using stimulated Raman transitions within the
evanescent wave. These transitions exhibit interference eﬀects whose phases depend on the atomic trajectories and on
the entire potential, as in quantum reﬂection. An important aspect of the eﬀects we discuss here is that they occur
for higher incident velocities than those considered in [16] and may therefore be experimentally easily accessible.
Furthermore, even for small velocities (near the recoil velocity) the eﬀects are more dramatic than those shown by
quantum reﬂection.

As discussed in Refs. [18] and [17], the experiment is analogous to an atom interferometer whose size is of the
order of a fraction of the evanescent wave decay length, κ−1. We will focus on three experimental cases: in the ﬁrst,
the atomic de Broglie wavelength λdB ≪ κ−1. This leads to interference fringes analogous to those in any other
interferometer. It corresponds to the experiment described in Ref. [17] in which rubidium (Rb) atoms are dropped
from a height of about 2 cm. Second, we will repeat the situation of the ﬁrst case, but with Rb replaced by meta-stable
helium (He*). In this case we have λdB/2π ≃ a few κ−1, which allows for only a few interference fringes. This allows
us to illustrate how the signal changes when only the atomic species is changed. Finally, we will examine the case
where λdB/2π ≃ κ−1, taking He* atoms at the recoil velocity as our example. No fringes are present, but a strong
dependence on the nature of the atom-wall potential is demonstrated. To simplify the discussion, we work with a
two-level model, between the initial atomic state and the adjacent one in the ground state manifold, thus neglecting
the populations of the other ground state sub-levels as well as the excited levels. For the atom-wall interaction we
will use the published values for each atom.

1

In the short λdB limit, the motion of the atom can be treated semi-classically. We thus calculate the transition
probability between the two atomic levels according to the Landau-Zener model for adiabatic transitions. In the other
cases, the study of the atomic motion requires a fully quantum mechanical treatment. We study these cases by solving
the associated coupled Schr¨odinger equations numerically.

In Sec.II we describe the physical system and the theory for atomic interference. In Sec.III the results are presented.

Discussion and conclusions are given in Sec.IV.

II. MODEL FOR INTERFERENCE OF MULTIPLE GROUND STATE SUB-LEVELS

We will focus on an experimental setup along the lines of Fig. 1. Here, a strong laser beam with frequency ω
and transverse magnetic (TM) polarization (i.e. magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the plane of incidence) creates an
evanescent wave, which is nearly σ− circularly polarized with respect to the y-axis. A second weak laser beam with
frequency ω − ∆ω and transverse electric (TE) polarization (i.e. electric ﬁeld perpendicular to the plane of incidence)
creates another evanescent wave with π polarization along the y-axis.

Atoms normally incident on the evanescent wave move in an eﬀective optical potential ˆVlight (which in general
depends on the internal state of the atom) and an attractive atom–wall interaction ˆVwall. The total potential is given
by

ˆU (z) = ˆVlight(z) + ˆVwall(z).

(1)

A. Optical potential

Let us consider an atom in the evanescent ﬁeld and assume for simplicity that the σ− polarized wave is strong
compared to the π wave. The σ− component lifts the magnetic (Zeeman) degeneracy of the atomic ground state
(the quantization axis is in the ˆy direction), so that each magnetic sub-level feels a diﬀerent optical potential. To
ﬁrst order, the π polarized wave produces a coupling between the atomic sub-levels via a Raman transition:
for
example, starting from the sub-level mi, the atom absorbs a σ− polarized photon and emits a stimulated photon with
π polarization. The atom thus ends up in the mi − 1 sub-state with its total energy increased by ¯h∆ω. This transition
is resonant when ¯h∆ω is equal to the energy diﬀerence between the magnetic sub-levels. If the two evanescent waves
are counter-propagating, in the reference frame moving with the optical grating, the situation corresponds to grazing
incidence diﬀraction [17]. For a review of the theoretical understanding of atomic diﬀraction and interference from
evanescent waves, see [19].

In the limit of low saturation and a detuning δ large compared to both the frequency diﬀerence ∆ω and the
natural linewidth, the excited state manifold may be eliminated adiabatically, and, for a ground state of total angular
momentum (including nuclear spin) Jg, the atomic wave function is described by the 2Jg + 1 Zeeman components
|m >, m = −Jg, ..., +Jg. An atom at a distance z from the surface of the mirror is subject to an optical potential
ˆVlight(z) whose matrix elements are of the form [we suppose that the frequency diﬀerence ∆ω and Zeeman shift are
negligible compared to the detuning δ and the hyperﬁne structure of the excited level]

where a product of Clebsch–Gordon–coeﬃcients appears on the rhs, the electric ﬁeld polarization is expanded in the
usual spherical basis with coeﬃcients Eq, (q = −1, 0, +1) and d is the reduced dipole moment. The optical potential
couples diﬀerent Zeeman sub-levels if the ﬁeld is not in a pure polarization state with respect to this basis, as in the
setup considered in this work. The optical potential due to the two evanescent waves can then be written as

assumed to be the same for each laser, n is the refraction index of the prism and θ is the angle of incidence of the
lasers with the surface. In our calculations we will always use n = 1.87 and θ = 53◦. The wave-vector k is diﬀerent
for each atom.

The numerical values of the constant C(3) for Rb and He* atoms used in this paper are given in Table I, as well
as the numerical values of some other important parameters. Since the atom is in a ground state with l = 0, the
value of C(3) is the same for any magnetic or hyperﬁne sub-level. The detailed interaction between a ground state Rb
or meta-stable He atom and a dielectric surface were recently calculated. For the van der Waals potential we have
used data from [21] for Rb and from [22] for He*. In the former work an interpolation formula for the van der Waals
potential is given as V QED

expressed in units of the laser wavelength λ/(2π). This formula approximates the numerical calculation with a 0.6%
accuracy between 0 and 10λ/(2π).

C. Population transfer

In this work we will consider only population transfer from the incident sub-level i to the ﬁnal one f (mf = mi − 1),
that is only two levels. This is a good approximation if the coupling is weak enough for the population of the other
levels to be negligible. An example of the total interaction potential from Eq. 1 is shown in Fig.2. The Uf f potential
curve has been shifted vertically by −¯h∆ω, corresponding to the kinetic energy change. Then the two (adiabatic)
potential curves cross at the point of resonance. The coupling turns the exact crossing into an avoided crossing. An
incoming wave function in the mi channel is split in two parts that are subsequently reﬂected from their respective
repulsive potentials and recombined after the second passage at the crossing. Thus, the evanescent wave realizes a
“Michelson interferometer” with a single beam splitter and two mirrors.

When the atomic λdB is short, the avoided crossing can be treated by means of the semi-classical Landau–Zener
model for non–adiabatic transitions [23]. Assuming that the atom moves through the crossing with a constant velocity
vc (ﬁxed by energy conservation), the Landau–Zener formula allows one to compute the probability amplitude for the
two atomic levels after the crossing. The transition probability wif from the initial sub-level i to the ﬁnal sub-level f
is given by

wi,f = 4TLZRLZ cos2(δφ),

(8)

where RLZ = 1 − TLZ and the transmission coeﬃcient is TLZ = exp(−πΛ), with Λ = 2| < i| ˆU |f > |2/(¯h2κ∆ωvc).

The phase diﬀerence δφ is given by the diﬀerence in the phase shifts between the crossing and the turning points

in the semi-classical approximation, plus a correction term [24]:

where zc is the position of the crossing point, zn,r the classical return point for an atom in the n-th level, pn(z) its
momentum and Γ the Gamma function.

Changing the frequency diﬀerence ∆ω/(2π) causes a change in the length of one of the interferometer arms, thus
a change in the phase diﬀerence δφ between the two paths. As a consequence we expect the transition probability to
show oscillations in ∆ω (St¨uckelberg oscillations). We will see in the next section that δφ is very sensitive to the exact
shape of the potential. The amplitude of the oscillations also depends on ∆ω both explicitly and implicitly through
vc (the crossing point moves with changing ∆ω).

The Landau–Zener model is a good approximation only when the atom speed is approximately constant during the
crossing. In particular it is not valid when the classical return point and the crossing are close to each other or when
the de Broglie wavelength of the atom is of the order of the width of the interaction region. In order to explore this
long-wavelength regime, we have to forgo the semi-classical Landau-Zener model and solve numerically the coupled
Schr¨odinger equations for the system. Since atoms that cross the potential barrier stick to the dielectric surface, the
appropriate boundary conditions at the surface are those for a running wave propagating downward (z → −∞), while
for z → ∞ the solution is a superposition of downward (incident) and upward (reﬂected) waves. We have integrated
the system of Schr¨odinger equations using the renormalized Numerov method [25]. To avoid the singularity at the
surface we have modiﬁed the potential to be a large negative constant near the interface and veriﬁed that the transition
probability does not change by varying the value of the constant.

III. RESULTS

We will present our calculations in two parts. First we discuss the short wavelength regime, and point out various
experimental strategies to observe retardation eﬀects. Then we discuss two cases in which the de Broglie wavelength
is not small compared to the evanescent wave decay length (the ”long wavelength regime”), in which a numerical
integration of the Schr¨odinger equation is necessary.

A. Short wavelength regime

Fig. 3 shows a calculation of the population transfer wif as a function of the frequency diﬀerence ∆ω for the
Lennard–Jones (LJ) and QED model of the van der Waals interaction. The value of the light potential is the same
for the two curves (i.e. the laser intensity is the same), and the incident momentum is 115¯hk, which corresponds to
Rb atoms dropped from a height of 2.3 cm. We use the Landau-Zener approach to calculate the transfer probability
(see Eq. 8). As in [18] and [17], we observe St¨uckelberg oscillations in the transfer probability. These oscillations
can be understood as the variations in the accumulated phase diﬀerence between the two diﬀerent paths taken by the
atoms after the level crossing shown in Fig.2. The de Broglie wavelength λdB is such that several fringes appear as
the position of the level crossing is moved through its possible range. The last oscillation at the higher frequencies
is where the crossing point and the classical return point are very close to each other and the Landau-Zener model
breaks down. We have set the probability to zero beyond this limit. In reality, the transition probability falls roughly
exponentially with frequency, as one ﬁnds solving the Schr¨odinger equations numerically (see next subsection).

In general, we ﬁnd that the dephasing between the two curves (with and without retardation eﬀects) is greatest
when the atoms are incident at an energy close to the top of the potential barrier. Note that the height of the barrier
is greater when retardation eﬀects are included, since these reduce the strength of the atom-surface interaction. The
eﬀect of retardation is roughly to shift these fringes by half a fringe to the left. The major cause of this shift is
the increase in the height of the total potential which is greater for the i level than the f level. A 10% increase in
the value of the light-shift potential would exhibit nearly the same shift. Therefore, since it is not possible to turn
retardation on and oﬀ, it would be necessary to measure absolutely the light-shift potential to better than 10% in
order to distinguish a retardation eﬀect. Experimentally this is rather diﬃcult. Instead of attempting to measure
the absolute light shift, one could rather measure the absolute height of the potential by observing the threshold of
reﬂection as in [11], and using the known kinetic energy of the atoms to get an absolute calibration of the height. Let
us assume then that the barrier height, instead of the light intensity, is known. In Fig.4a we show the result with the
same parameters as in Fig.3 except for the light intensity in the LJ model, which has been changed so as to have the
same barrier height as the QED model. In this case the shift is much smaller, about 1/5 of a fringe. We have veriﬁed

4

that even taking into account an experimental uncertainty of a few % in the height of the corresponding potentials,
the two models are still clearly resolved.

This approach seems feasible, but a third method of observing the eﬀects of retardation is possible if one uses more
of the information available in the oscillation curve. Fig. 4b shows the same curves as Fig. 4a but with the QED
curve numerically shifted so as to coincide with the LJ curve at its maximum. One sees that the period of these
oscillations is not the same. It decreases with decreasing detuning, faster for the full QED potential, so that there is
a diﬀerence in the spacing of the minima in the population transfer. Thus with fringes with suﬃciently high signal
to noise, one can distinguish retardation while leaving the absolute barrier height as a free parameter in a ﬁt to the
data. It seems to us that a viable experimental method is to use a combination of the second two approaches. Careful
measurements of the barrier height can be used to cross check a ﬁt to the St¨uckelberg oscillations with the barrier
height as a free parameter.

The incident energy, momentum and barrier height used in Figs. 3 and 4a were arbitrarily chosen to correspond to
the experiment in [17], but it would be interesting to know how Figs. 3 and 4a would change, especially for diﬀerent
incident momenta (de Broglie wavelengths). We studied this question by repeating the calculation of Fig. 4a, for
diﬀerent incident momenta, while always keeping the barrier height 10% above the incident kinetic energy. We ﬁnd
that, roughly speaking, the number of oscillations increases as the incident momentum. This is because the number
of fringes in the interferogram increases with decreasing wavelength. The accumulated phase diﬀerence between the
oscillations in the LJ and QED models, over the corresponding frequency range, also increases approximately linearly
with incident momentum. Thus if we consider the fringe shift divided by the fringe period as a ﬁgure of merit, the
sensitivity of the experiment to retardation eﬀects increases with increasing incident momentum.

B. Long wavelength regime

We now examine the large de Broglie wavelength limit, where the semi-classical model breaks down since the atomic
wavelength is not small compared to the interferometer size. We ﬁrst consider the case of He* atoms dropped from
a height of a few cm as for Rb. We show the results in Fig. 5. For an initial distance of 2.3 cm from the mirror,
the incident momentum of He* is 7.4¯hk, much lower than for Rb. Again we will chose the intensities of the strong
σ− wave so as to have the same barrier height for the two potentials, about 10% above the incident kinetic energy.
In this regime, to observe interference, the detuning between the evanescent waves must be of only a few MHz, in
fact, beyond about 10MHz the crossing point is closer to the surface than the return point. One only sees one or
two St¨uckelberg oscillations since the momentum involved is small and the atoms do not accumulate enough phase
diﬀerence to show more oscillations. The two potentials give similar results (Fig.5), the main diﬀerence being in the
shape and height of the big peak.

We have also looked at even lower incident momenta. Near the recoil limit, one can expect interference only for
detunings of less than one MHz and the accumulated phase diﬀerence is too small in this range to show any St¨uckelberg
oscillations. Both for He* and Rb one obtains a big peak in the transition probability and no St¨uckelberg oscillations,
as expected. The diﬀerence between the van der Waals potential and the full QED potential still shows up in the
diﬀerent shape and height of the peaks (Fig.6). Here the width of the curve is delimited by the frequency for which
the classical return point and the crossing point coincide.

Finally we note that the qualitative features of the short and long λdB limit are the same for Rb and He*, e.g. He*

with an incident momentum of about 100¯hk gives the same type of oscillation pattern as Rb.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have proposed an experiment to probe van der Waals like surface interactions by exploiting
interference mechanisms for well deﬁned Zeeman sub-levels of atoms moving in two evanescent waves. Retardation
can be resolved using atoms incident at speeds which are easily obtained in free fall over a few centimeters. The
controlling parameter is here the detuning between the two evanescent waves. One then measures the fraction of the
atoms which have undergone a change of magnetic sub-level as a function of this detuning.

For the situation in which the atomic de Broglie wavelength is suﬃciently small the experiment resembles typical
interferometry experiments. The theoretical description is semi-classical, employing well deﬁned atomic trajectories,
while experimentally, one seeks a particular (non sinusoidal) fringe pattern as a signature of retardation. This should
be possible with an improved version of the experiment of Ref. [17].

Another approach is to investigate the interaction of atoms whose de Broglie wavelength is not small compared
to the length scale of the interferometer. In this regime most of the information is to be found in the shape of the

5

population transfer curve, since there are very few or zero interference fringes. Note though, that we have assumed
throughout that the incident atoms are mono-energetic. This means that the velocity spread of the incident atoms
must be small compared to the atomic recoil. Nevertheless this may be worth the eﬀort, because the predicted eﬀect
of retardation is quite dramatic.

For a quantitative comparison however, the presence of all the sub-levels (which give rise to the multiple crossing
of the dressed potentials at the same distance zc from the surface) and, possibly, losses from spontaneous emission
have to be taken into account, but the results are not qualitatively diﬀerent.

FIG. 2. Typical potential curves experienced by the atoms during reﬂection. The potential for state f is shifted by the
Raman energy −¯h∆ω. The atoms approach the potential barrier in state i, pass through the curve crossing twice and can end
up on either state i or f . For each ﬁnal situation, two paths are possible (between the crossing and the turning points) and
can interfere producing fringes as a function of the location of the crossing.

FIG. 4. Upper ﬁgure: population transfer wif (see Eq. 8) vs frequency diﬀerence ∆ω/(2π) for rubidium atoms released 2.3
cm above the mirror (i.e. with incident momentum 115¯hkRb). The solid line is for the QED model and the dashed line for the
Leenard–Jones (LJ) model. The height of the potential barrier is 1.48 × 104ERb
r , i.e. the intensity of the strong laser beam has
been adjusted to give the same barrier height for both models. The light–shift coeﬃcients for the QED model are the same as
for Fig. 3, while for the LJ model |Cii| = 4.11× 104ERb
r . Lower ﬁgure: same parameters as in the previous
ﬁgure with the LJ curve artiﬁcially shifted 0.79 MHz to the left in order to show the changes in fringe spacing.

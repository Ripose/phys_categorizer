Spin polarization created by optical pumping in a thermal cesium beam is allowed to evolve in
static magnetic and / or electric ﬁelds and is probed downstream by a circularly polarized probe
beam. As a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength, a typical Ramsey fringe pattern is observed.
Phase shifts due to the interaction of a static electric ﬁeld are detected as fringe shifts, which yields
a new method for the measurement of the tensor polarizability α2 of the ground state of alkali
atoms. We show that the electric tensor polarizability of 133Cs can be measured with a statistical
uncertainty of 0.7%. Absolute measurements are currently limited by systematic eﬀects.

INTRODUCTION

Alkali atoms - due to their single weakly bound valence
electron - have the largest electric polarizabilities of all
elements. These polarizabilities arise as a result of second
order perturbation theory of the Stark interaction and
manifest themselves as E 2-dependent shifts of the energy
levels induced by an external electric ﬁeld E. Because of
the spherical symmetry of the alkali 2S1/2 ground state
conﬁguration, the Stark eﬀect for these elements has a
scalar nature, which is conventionally parametrized in
terms of a scalar polarizability α0. All hyperﬁne sublevels
of the ground state experience the same shift and their
degeneracy is not lifted by the electric ﬁeld.

In third order perturbation theory, however,

the
hyperﬁne (Fermi contact, dipole-dipole and electric
quadrupole) interaction, together with the Stark interac-
tion, leads to a strongly suppressed (six to seven orders of
magnitude with respect to the scalar polarizability), but
ﬁnite value of the tensor polarizability α2. The electric
ﬁeld induced shift of the hyperﬁne Zeeman component
|F, MF i is given by

.

The scalar polarizability α0(F ) contains an F-dependent
third order correction (from the Fermi contact interac-
tion) to the second order scalar polarizability. This cor-
rection leads to a diﬀerential shift of the two hyperﬁne
levels F± = I ±J, and has been measured on the Cs clock
transitions [1, 2]. This eﬀect is approximately 2 orders
of magnitude larger than the tensor eﬀect discussed here.
For Cs atoms in typical laboratory ﬁelds in the range of
a few 10 kV/cm, one expects sublevel splittings due to
the tensor polarizability on the order of 1 Hz. The tensor
polarizabilities of several alkali elements were measured

in the 1960’s using atomic beams and conventional Ram-
sey resonance spectroscopy. However, the authors of [3]
found large discrepancies between the predicted [4, 5]
theoretical values of α2 and their experimental results.

The novel Ramsey resonance technique presented here
is an all-optical technique, which does not use radio-
frequency (r.f.) or microwave ﬁelds and allows to study
the tensor Stark eﬀect of the two ground state hyper-
ﬁne levels individually. Compared to the conventional
Ramsey technique our method avoids r.f. power depen-
dent systematic eﬀects that are due, e.g., to multi-(r.f.)
photon processes (cf. [3]).

FARADAY-RAMSEY SPECTROSCOPY

The measurements presented in this paper were per-
formed using an optical pump-probe technique in a ther-
mal cesium beam (ﬁgure 1). A circularly polarized pump
beam resonant with a hyperﬁne component of the Cs D2
line (852 nm) produces spin polarization ~S = h ~F i ori-
ented along the ~k-vector of the pump beam and per-
pendicular to the atomic velocity ~v. When exposed
to a static magnetic ﬁeld ~B, the spin polarization pre-
cesses around the magnetic ﬁeld at the Larmor frequency
ωB = γF · | ~B|.

The spin polarization is measured downstream by
recording the transmission of a weak circularly polarized
probe laser beam. The absorption depends on the pro-
jection of the velocity averaged spin polarization on the
probe laser beam. The magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the
transmitted intensity then leads to a damped oscillatory
pattern (Ramsey fringes) symmetric around B = 0. For
practical purposes it is more convenient to work with a
dispersive (antisymmetric around B = 0 ) fringe pattern.
Such a line shape can be generated by applying a small
amplitude modulation to the magnetic ﬁeld and detecting
the transmitted intensity using a lock-in ampliﬁer locked
to the modulation frequency. For ϑ = 90◦ the resulting

where ρ(v) dv is the velocity distribution of the atomic
density in the probe region. A typical experimental
recording of such a Ramsey fringe pattern is shown as
insert in ﬁgure 1. The steep central zero-crossing of this
pattern is a very sensitive discriminant for the measure-
ment of other (e.g. ~E-ﬁeld induced) interactions which
produce diﬀerential phase shifts of the magnetic sub-
levels of the ground state. Previous experiments using
this technique were carried out with linearly polarized
laser beams and detected the rotation of the probe beam
polarization. The description of the nonlinear Faraday-
eﬀect as a three step process [6, 7] together with Ram-
sey’s idea of separated ﬁelds gave this method the name
of Faraday-Ramsey spectroscopy (FRS) [8, 9]. FRS has
been used to measure the Aharonov-Casher phase shift
of 85Rb [10].

The key idea of the experimental technique used to
measure the tensor polarizability is the following: In the
interaction zone the Cs beam is exposed to parallel static
electric ~E and magnetic ~B ﬁelds oriented at an angle ϑ
with respect to the ~k-vector of the pump beam. When
~E = 0 a feed-back loop actively stabilizes the magnetic
ﬁeld to the center of the dispersive central Ramsey fringe.
Any additional phase shift induced by the electric ﬁeld
is then compensated by an automatic adjustment of the
magnetic ﬁeld. The corresponding compensation current
IFB in the ﬁeld generating coils is the signal of interest.
For the quantitative interpretation of this compensa-
tion technique one has to know the electric ﬁeld equiv-

2

alent of the magnetic compensation ﬁeld. A straight-
forward calculation shows that the ﬁeld-induced change
of the probe absorption coeﬃcient for a monochromatic
beam prepared in the pump region in the stretched hy-
perﬁne state |F, MF = F i can be expressed as

The integrals are over the atomic trajectories between the
pump and probe regions. As both phases have the same
dependence on the atomic velocity v any velocity aver-
aging will produce a mere proportionality factor, which
is irrelevant for the following discussion, and will thus
be omitted. Equation 3 - derived under the assumption
ΦB,E ≪ 1 - allows to deﬁne the optimal geometry and
to calibrate the electric shift in terms of the magnetic
compensation. As the feedback loop in the experiment
adjusts the magnetic ﬁeld such that S1(ΦB, ΦE) = 0, the
signal S is most sensitive to ΦE , i.e., to the tensor po-
larizability when ϑ is chosen to be the magic angle ϑm,
which satisﬁes 3 cos2 ϑm − 1 = 0 and which maximizes
the electric contribution in Equation 3. The same equa-
tion can also be used to deﬁne the magnetic equivalent
of the electric phase shift, which implies

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

In the experiment, the pump and probe beams are de-
livered by the same extended cavity diode laser locked
to the F = 4 → F ′ = 5 hyperﬁne component of the Cs
D2 transition using standard saturated absorption spec-
troscopy in an auxiliary vapor cell. The laser beam is
transferred to the experiment proper by an optical ﬁber
which also serves as a mode cleaner. The output in-
tensity of the ﬁber is actively stabilized by a feed-back

circuit controlling the input intensity with an acousto-
optic modulator. The atomic beam is produced by a
reﬂux oven [11] operated at a temperature of 130◦C and
delivering a beam with a divergence of 40 mrad. Be-
tween the pump and probe zones – separated by a 30
cm long interaction zone – the atomic beam propagates
in a 7 cm diameter electrically grounded tube, which
contains a pair of polished copper electrodes that can
be rotated around the atomic beam axis. One of the
electrodes is grounded, while the other electrode is con-
nected to a computer-controlled high voltage power sup-
ply that allows to apply electric ﬁelds up to 20 kV/cm.
Two grounded diaphragms are located between the elec-
trodes and the laser beams to ensure that the pump and
probe interactions take place in an electric ﬁeld-free en-
vironment. A solenoid wound on the beam tube and two
pairs of rectangular coils allow to apply magnetic ﬁelds
of arbitrary orientation and/or to shield unwanted ﬁeld
components. All coils extend over the pump and probe
regions. The whole set-up is enclosed in a double cylindri-
cal mu-metal shield. The data acquisition (high voltage
and feedback current) is controlled by a PC and the ro-
bustness of the laser frequency lock allows the experiment
to be run overnight without user intervention.

SYSTEMATIC STUDIES AND RESULTS

When ϑ 6= 90◦ the motional magnetic ﬁeld seen by the
atoms moving through the static electric ﬁeld leads to an
additional magnetic phase shift, which is proportional to
the electric ﬁeld, i.e. to UHV. This linear Stark eﬀect
is also known as Aharonov-Casher phase shift [10]. A
further noisy background may come from slowly drifting
magnetic oﬀset ﬁelds. The measurements were therefore
performed in a way that allows to eliminate these back-
grounds from the recorded data.

In a typical experimental run (12 hours) the data ac-
quisition software controls the high voltage power supply
by applying 5 discrete voltages Ui (i = 1, . . . , 5) to the
electrodes, each with both polarities. Part of an experi-
mental run, which consists of individual two minute long
recordings is shown in ﬁgure 2. We start with UHV = 0
and record IFB. Then the software applies the voltage
UHV = Ui=1 and records IFB for another two minutes,
after which the polarity is reversed and IFB is recorded
with UHV = −Ui=1 . In the next step i is incremented
by 1 and the cycle starts again with UHV = 0. When
i = 5 is reached (end of ﬁgure 2), the whole procedure is
repeated. The integration time of 2 minutes was chosen
after a detailed study of the system stability in terms of
the Allan variance of IFB, which showed a minimal value
for integration times between 100 and 200 seconds.

Figure 2 shows a dominant linear dependence of IFB
on UHV (the Ui were chosen to be approximately equidis-
tant) due to the motional ﬁeld eﬀect, while the asym-

after oﬀset and motional ﬁeld subtraction. The (vertical) sta-
tistical error bar of each data point corresponds to the dot
size.

metry of data recorded with positive and negative high
voltage is due to the tensor polarizability. In the oﬀ-line
data analysis the average value of IFB for each high volt-
age is computed. Then the diﬀerence of time consecutive
measurements with and without high voltage are calcu-
lated in order to subtract base line drifts and ﬁnally the
values thus obtained for consecutive measurements with
reversed polarities are averaged in order to eliminate the
contribution from the motional ﬁeld eﬀect. The resulting
averaged values then show a pure quadratic dependence
on UHV as illustrated in ﬁgure 3.

A simple quadratic ﬁt to the data points allows, to-
gether with the calibration constants β and ε, to infer
α2 using equation 5 with a typical statistical error of 1%
per run. The magnetic calibration constant β was in-
ferred from the Ramsey fringe pattern with a precision

of 0.3%, while the electric calibration constant ε was de-
termined by a semi-emprical method involving both nu-
merical calculations using an adaptive boundary element
method and the Aharonov–Casher phase shift (precision
of 0.3%). Details of these calibration procedures will be
published elsewhere [12].

The automated measurements have allowed us to study
diﬀerent systematic eﬀects. No signiﬁcant dependence of
the results on doubling or halving the pump laser in-
tensity was found. This proves that the beam is fully
polarized in the |F = 4, MF = 4i hyperﬁne state, which
is a prerequisite for the validity of equation 3. There was
also no detectable dependence of the results on slight
misalignments of the quarter-wave plates producing the
circularly polarized light, nor on variations of the oven
temperature and hence the velocity distribution of the
beam. Variations of the probe intensity yielded no eﬀect
on the obtained results. There is however a serious sys-
tematic uncertainty, which currently limits the absolute
precision of the results. Equations 4 and 5 were derived
by assuming that the magnetic and electric ﬁelds are per-
fectly parallel. The orientation of the electric ﬁeld was
realized by a mechanical rotation of the electrode struc-
ture and could be determined with an accuracy of better
than 1%. For historical reasons the rotated magnetic ﬁeld
was realized by adding the ﬁelds of two orthogonal pairs
of coils. The contribution from the uncertainty (2.5◦) of
this alignment to the ﬁnal result was estimated from a
systematic experimental study. The uncertainties for ε,
β and ϑ, together with the dominating error from the
relative orientation of the E and B ﬁelds yield a (conser-
vative) upper bound for the total systematic uncertainty
of 7.5%.

After averaging ﬁve runs the overall statistical error is

0.7%, which leads to the preliminary result of

α2(F = 4)/h = −3.34(2)(25) · 10−8 Hz

(V/cm)2 ,

where the numbers in parentheses give the statistical and
systematic errors respectively. The value of α2(F = 4)
inferred from previously reported [3] experimental results
is

α2(F = 4)/h = −3.66(21)(7.3) · 10−8 Hz

(V/cm)2

while the theoretical prediction from [4, 5] quoted in the
article by Gould et al. [13] is

α2(F = 4)/h = −4.133 · 10−8 Hz

(V/cm)2 .

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We have demonstrated a novel technique for the mea-
surement of tensor polarizabilities in alkali atoms. We

have shown that with 133Cs a statistical precision below
the 1% level can be achieved. The technique can easily be
extended to other atoms by using suitable atomic beams
and light ﬁelds. Our result is consistent with an earlier
experimental result, and conﬁrms the previously reported
discrepancy with theoretical calculations at our current
In order to overcome the main cur-
level of precision.

a new precision electrode arrangement with integrated
magnetic ﬁeld coils is currently under construction. With
this improved set-up, a measurement of α2 at the 1% level

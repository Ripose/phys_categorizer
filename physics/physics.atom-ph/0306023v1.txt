Abstract. The role of shake-oﬀ for double ionization of atoms by a single photon
with ﬁnite energy has become the subject of debate. In this letter, we attempt to clarify
the meaning of shake-oﬀ at low photon energies by comparing diﬀerent formulations
appearing in the literature and by suggesting a working deﬁnition. Moreover, we
elaborate on the foundation and justiﬁcation of a mixed quantum-classical ansatz for
the calculation of single-photon double ionization.

It is well known that the double-to-single cross section ratio for ionization of atoms
by a single photon does not vanish at high photon energies. Rather, it approaches a
ﬁnite constant which can be explained in the framework of a sudden approximation by
the so-called shake-oﬀ mechanism. While shake-oﬀ is well deﬁned in the asymptotic
high-energy limit, its meaning at ﬁnite energies is less clear and has been the subject
In fact, a number of deﬁnitions can be found in the literature,
of debate recently.
e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Some of these deﬁnitions are based on formal diagrammatic
perturbation expansion techniques [3, 5], others on more general physical arguments
[2, 4], others on a simple extension of the sudden approximation idea to ﬁnite energies
[1, 6, 7]. Most of them (with the exception of [3], see below) have in common that
they approach the well-known asymptotic expression at high energies. At low and
intermediate energies, however, they may diﬀer markedly (e.g., some show a monotonic
dependence on energy while others have a maximum at some ﬁnite energy, some even
exceed the total double-to-single cross section ratio measured experimentally). Thus, so
far no unique deﬁnition for shake-oﬀ at ﬁnite energies exists, and it is not obvious what
“the best” deﬁnition might be. On the other hand, in particular in connection with
the interpretation of experimental data, attention has been given to the question what
physical mechanisms dominate double ionization and at which energies the diﬀerent
mechanisms are important [8].

One may argue that a satisfying deﬁnition of shake-oﬀ would be one based on
physical principles in addition to mathematical rigor. Hence, a “good” deﬁnition should
separate shake-oﬀ as much as possible from other ionization mechanisms. Clearly, such
a separation is not strictly possible in the presence of other available routes to ionization
and can only be approximate, which makes the discussion of a shake-oﬀ mechanism a
somewhat delicate issue. In comparing calculations with experiments, e.g., one should
always keep in mind that no strict one-to-one correspondence between a shake-oﬀ
mechanism as an approximate physical picture and a separate calculation of shake-
oﬀ can be expected due to the neglect of interference between possible decay routes.
Nevertheless, since such simple physical pictures, to the extent of their applicability,
can be very valuable for our intuitive understanding of physical processes, a deﬁnition
separating shake-oﬀ from “non-shake-oﬀ” would seem most rewarding conceptually. One
such deﬁnition has recently been given by Schneider et al. [7] (hereafter referred to as
SCR), where the single-photon double ionization process has been described in terms of
two separate contributions, namely “shake-oﬀ” and “knock-out”. The method used in
SCR was shown to lead to excellent agreement with experiment and ab-initio calculations
for double ionization from the ground state [7, 9], and very recently also from excited
states [10], of helium. Thus, it suggests itself as a more or less natural “operational”
deﬁnition of shake-oﬀ in the framework of the “half-collision” picture of single-photon
multiple ionization [11, 4].

The calculation reported in SCR starts from a mixed quantum-classical ansatz
that is based on the separation of the photoabsorption process (which is not treated
explicitly in the calculation) from the subsequent evolution of the system. It treats this

Letter to the Editor

evolution (i.e. the redistribution of the energy between the two electrons) in the spirit of
an (e,2e)–like process with the additional possibility of shake-oﬀ. Such a “half-collision”
picture has been originally suggested by Samson [11] and elaborated by Pattard and
Burgd¨orfer [4], allowing for shake-oﬀ processes which are not taken into account in
Samson’s original model. In the SCR ansatz, the (e,2e)–like (“knock-out”) part of the
cross section is calculated using a classical trajectory Monte Carlo method, to which
the shake-oﬀ as a purely quantum mechanical process is added on top. In this spirit,
shake-oﬀ is introduced as a more or less ad-hoc quantum correction to an essentially
classical treatment. Here, we start from a fully quantum mechanical expression and see
which kind of approximations lead to an SCR-like ansatz. In this way, further insight
into the validity of the ansatz, concerning both technical details of the calculation as
well as the approximate separation of physical mechanisms (shake-oﬀ and knock-out),
can be obtained.

In ref. [4], a Born series for the transition amplitude from the ground state ψi
to a ﬁnal state ψ(0)
of a two-electron target following single-photon absorption has
f
been derived. It was shown that, under the assumption of negligible electron–electron
correlation in the ionized ﬁnal state, the transition amplitude can be written as

In the above equation, Vpe is the photon-electron interaction, usually taken in dipole
approximation, H0 is the ﬁnal-state Hamiltonian H0 = Hat −
Vee and Tee denotes the
Coulomb T -matrix for electron-electron scattering. ψ(0)
is an eigenfunction of H0, i.e. a
f
product of two one-electron states, due to the assumption of vanishing electron-electron
correlation in the ﬁnal state (where at least one electron is ionized), while ψi is the
fully correlated initial (ground) state of the target. Introduction of a complete set of
intermediate states then allows for a separation (on the amplitude level!) of the initial
photon absorption from the subsequent propagation

that S+ is not strictly an S-matrix for electron-electron scattering since the time

basis states are then orthogonal to Vpeψi. Thus the sum over intermediate states in
equation (2) collapses to a single term and we can write

which in general does not coincide with the expression (7) involving an additional delta

it can be seen that it is precisely the oﬀ-shell (i.e. oﬀ the ﬁnal-
state energy shell) part of ψabs which prohibits an exact factorization of the transition
probability into a photon absorption probability and an “energy redistribution” part.
Note that this can also be seen from equation (2) directly if the set of intermediate

it becomes clear that the oﬀ-shell part of ψabs is a consequence of time ordering [12],
i.e. that requiring the photon to be absorbed ﬁrst restricts the time integral in (3) to
positive t.

For the remainder of this discussion, let us neglect the photon absorption process
and focus on the second step of the ionization process, namely the “half-collision” part
of equation (5)

the operator “T ” involving electron-electron interaction. Naturally, the former can be
associated with a shake process while the latter corresponds to a “knock-on” (we use the
expressions shake and knock-on for any ﬁnal state and the terms shake-oﬀ and knock-out
for doubly ionized states as in SCR). Hence, we propose
√2π δ (Ef −

h
as a working deﬁnition for the shake amplitude at a ﬁnite excess energy E = Ei + ω.
However, the shake and knock-on contributions are summed on the amplitude level. To
arrive at the SCR ansatz, the additional approximation of an incoherent summation of
shake and knock-on has to be made
. The error introduced by this approximation is
‡
at most of the order of the smaller of the two contributions, i.e. it goes to zero in the
high- as well as low-energy limit and could only contribute signiﬁcantly at intermediate
energies. Even there it was found in SCR that the error is of the order of a few percent
only (at least for the double-to-single ionization ratio of helium). One would speculate
[4, 9] that this is to a large extent due to the population of diﬀerent ﬁnal states by the
two mechanisms. For shake, e.g., the “shaken” electron will be in an s-state, while the
knock-on mechanism will also populate higher angular momentum states. Calculations
of angular-diﬀerential cross sections should shed further light on this question.

This expression diﬀers somewhat from the one given by ˚Aberg [1] (equation (7) of
SCR). In contrast to the former, it contains the “photoabsorption operator” Vpe.
It
seems that the current deﬁnition equation (14) is preferable since it arises naturally
from the preceding arguments: The sudden approximation underlying the shake-oﬀ
picture is with respect to the electron-electron interaction, not with respect to the
photon absorption. As noted by SCR, if the photoelectron is in an s-state initially, it
will be in a p-state after absorption of the photon. That is, to the extent that the
dipole approximation is valid for the photon-electron interaction and that the single-
particle angular momentum l is a good quantum number, the ψν deﬁned by ˚Aberg

in the numerator and the denominator of (14) they cancel out, leading to the same
high-energy limit. The same is true for all energies if, as in SCR, product wavefunctions
are used for the initial state, or if the PEAK approximation is employed [4, 7, 9], i.e. if
the absorption of the photon is assumed to happen always at the nucleus at any excess
energy E. In this case one arrives at the “natural” deﬁnition (equation (8) of SCR)

As argued above, the successful application of the SCR method showing excellent
agreement with experiment and ab-initio calculations suggests the adoption of equation
In this spirit, shake-oﬀ may be

phrased vaguely as the part of the double ionization that is absent in a full collision (due
to the orthogonality of initial and ﬁnal states), or, more precisely, that part which does
not involve an electron-electron interaction explicitly (of course, interaction is implicit in
the correlation present in the initial state, without which there would be no shake-oﬀ).
It should be noted that the quality of this deﬁnition depends on the observation that
there is very little interference between shake-oﬀ and knock-out, as discussed above.
The fact that this is not strictly true leads to some problems e.g. at very low energies,
where this separation would lead to a linear dependence of the double ionization cross
section on the excess energy, in contrast to the well-known Wannier threshold power
law [13].

On the other hand, one might want to adopt a maybe more “physical” deﬁnition
of shake-oﬀ on the basis of the intuitive picture of a time-dependence of the eﬀective
one-electron potential the “shaken” electron feels. For asymptotically high energies, it
is the sudden change of this potential that leads to a relaxation of the electron which
In this sense, the
is not in an eigenstate anymore after the potential has changed.
change in the eﬀective potential does not occur suddenly anymore at ﬁnite energies, but
rather over a timescale given by the velocity of the outgoing photoelectron. This is the
basis for the deﬁnition of shake-oﬀ adopted in [2], where an expression has been derived
from time-dependent perturbation theory, and also the rationale behind the somewhat
ad-hoc formulation used in [4] which is motivated by a Rosen-Zener-like expression
for diabatic transition probabilities familiar from ion-atom collisions.
It should be
noted that, in contrast to (14), both of these expressions show an exponential decrease
towards threshold, so that the Wannier threshold law is recovered. While in the SCR-
expression the probability to be shaken into a speciﬁc ﬁnal state does not depend on
the rate of change of the potential (i.e. the velocity v of the photoelectron) as long as
it is energetically allowed, this is diﬀerent in [2, 4] where these probabilities depend
exponentially on v2 and v, respectively. In view of these diﬀerences, it is surprising to
see that the numerical values resulting from these diﬀerent deﬁnitions are in fact rather
similar, as is demonstrated in ﬁgure 1. This leads us to suggest (14) as a good working

deﬁnition of shake-oﬀ at ﬁnite energies. It agrees qualitatively with other natural and
maybe more “physical” deﬁnitions and, moreover, it has been shown to lead to a very
good approximate separation of mechanisms into shake-oﬀ and knock-out. It is easy to
calculate and, as compared to [2, 4], has the advantage that it does not contain any free
parameters (such as a characteristic range of interaction as in [2] or an eﬀective impact
parameter as in [4]). However, one should always keep in mind that the signiﬁcance of
(14) as an independent physically meaningful quantity is limited, as discussed, e.g., in
connection with the behaviour of the cross section near threshold.

At this point, a short comment on a comparison with other available deﬁnitions
of shake-oﬀ seems to be in place. So far we have given a comparison with [2, 4] only,
and used the qualitative agreement with the values calculated from the expressions given
there as an argument in favour of the current deﬁnition. However, as argued before, some
other deﬁnitions found in the literature lead to shake-oﬀ values rather diﬀerent from
the present. The shake-oﬀ calculated from many-body perturbation theory (MBPT)
[3], e.g., is found to have a completely diﬀerent behaviour.
Its shape (as a function
of energy) as well as the high-energy limit reached, even the answer to the question
whether it is the dominant process at high energies or not, depend on the choice of the
gauge in which the corresponding diagram is calculated. This is not too surprising in
view of the fact that only the sum of all ﬁrst-order diagrams (shake-oﬀ plus ground-state
correlation plus two-step one) has a well-deﬁned and gauge invariant meaning. Hence,
the meaning of shake-oﬀ is well deﬁned within MBPT, however it is not claimed to have
any independent physical meaning of its own. In this sense, it is not a helpful quantity if
one wishes to discuss approximate physical mechanisms. Another deﬁnition, originally
formulated by ˚Aberg [1], has recently been used by Shi and Lin [6] to calculate shake-oﬀ
double ionization of the helium ground state. Their result for the double-to-single cross
section ratio is found to be signiﬁcantly larger than the latest experimental data for

Letter to the Editor

the total ratio, i.e. including all possible decay routes (e.g. shake-oﬀ and knock-out).
From [6] it is not entirely clear how much of this “overshooting” has to be attributed
to a poor choice of the ground state wavefunction (leading to an asymptotic high-
energy limit which is somewhat too large) and how much would still be observed using
a more accurate initial state. Assuming that this eﬀect persists it would be obvious
that again no physical meaning can be ascribed to this deﬁnition of shake-oﬀ, since
shake-oﬀ alone would already be larger than the sum of all mechanisms. In any case, a
further discussion would have to await a corresponding formulation of “non-shake-oﬀ”,
since it is only the sum of all possible ionization mechanisms which can directly be
compared with experiment. Finally, Kheifets [5] has proposed a deﬁnition of shake-oﬀ
where the diagonal part of the T -matrix contribution to the convergent close-coupling
model is absorbed into shake-oﬀ. In his calculations for helium, it was found that with
this deﬁnition of shake-oﬀ the total cross section ratio approaches the shake-oﬀ value
quickly, and non-shake-oﬀ becomes negligible at about 100 eV excess energy. However,
the last panel of ﬁgure 2 of [5] shows that for lower energies shake-oﬀ alone again exceeds
the total ratio. Hence, once more one has to conclude that the meaning of shake-oﬀ as
deﬁned in [5] as an independent physical mechanism is limited.

In summary, we have argued that no unique deﬁnition for shake-oﬀ at ﬁnite energies
exists. Nevertheless, we propose equation (14) as a good “operational” deﬁnition.
Clearly, when shake-oﬀ at ﬁnite energies is discussed (in particular in the sense of
an approximate physical mechanism in connection with experiments), care has to be
taken of the precise meaning of the term, i.e. its actual deﬁnition adopted in each case.
In addition to our discussion of shake-oﬀ, we have indicated a way towards a rigorous
derivation of the SCR ansatz for calculation of double ionization by relating it to a
perturbation expansion starting from a full quantum mechanical point of view.

T.P. would like to thank Joachim Burgd¨orfer for stimulating his interest in the
problem of single-photon multiple ionization, as well as many very helpful discussions.

Abstract

It is well known that for the case of two neutral but electrically polarizable atoms the
consideration or not of retardation eﬀects on the dispersive van der Waals force between
them leads essentially to diﬀerent power laws for the forces; while the retarded force
is proportional to 1/r8, where r is the distance between the atoms, the non-retarded
force is proportional to 1/r7. Here we consider the (repulsive) dispersive force between an
electrically polarizable atom and a magnetically polarizable one and show that, in contrast
to the previous case, a quite unexpected result appears, namely: while the retarded force
is still proportional to 1/r8, the non-retarded force is proportional to 1/r5. We employ a
semiclassical method based on the ﬂuctuating dipole model for both atoms.

In the context of thermodynamics of real gases, it was recognized by van der Waals [1] in
the second half of last century that attractive forces should exist between molecules (atoms)
even when the molecules do not posses permanent electric dipole moments. Since these forces
depend on the atomic (electric) polarizabilities, which in turn are closely related to the refractive
index, they are referred to as dispersive van der Waals forces. When retardation eﬀects of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld interaction are neglected, an approximation that can be made only for
short distances, these forces are called non-retarded dispersive van der Waals forces, while
the name retarded dispersive van der Waals forces is left for the cases where the retardation
eﬀects are not negligible. From experimental data, van der Waals tried to infer the form of
the interaction energy between the atoms, but the correct form and explanation for the non-
dispersive forces had to wait for the advent of quantum mechanics and only after the paper
by London [2] in 1930 the precise origin of these forces were understood. The inﬂuence of
retardation eﬀects on the dispersive forces were obtained for the ﬁrst time in 1948 by Casimir
and Polder [3]. Basically they showed that, while the non-retarded force is proportional to
1/r7, where r is the distance between the two atoms, the retarded force behaves like 1/r8. An
immediate consequence of dispersive forces between two atoms is the existence of (dispersive)
forces also for macroscopic bodies (for a detailed discussion see for instance [4]). For the
case of two rareﬁed macroscopic bodies, the resultant dispersive force can be obtained by a
direct integration of the pairwise forces. On the other hand, for non-rareﬁed media the non-
additivity eﬀects must be taken into account [4, 5] (see also [6] for a simple discussion). However,
though the ﬁnal numerical result is aﬀected by these eﬀects, the pairwise integration already
gives the correct dependence on the geometry. For instance, the retarded force per unit area
between two parallel semi-inﬁnite slabs of polarizable material distant apart a distance d is
proportional to 1/d4, no matter the non-sdditivities are taken into account or not. Retardation
eﬀects are automatically taken into account when the interaction energy is calculated with
the aid of the zero-point energy method, introduced in 1948 by Casimir [7].
In fact, the
(standard electromagnetic) Casimir force between two macroscopic bodies can be considered
as the retarded dispersive van der Waals force between them with the non-additivity eﬀects
included1.

In this note, we shall investigate the non-retarded interaction between two non-similar
atoms: one of them is only electrically polarizable and the other, only magnetically polarizable.
We shall show that a quite unexpected result is obtained, namely: while the retarded interac-
tion is proportional to 1/r7 (retarded force proportional to 1/r8), the non-retarded interaction
is proportional to 1/r4 (non-retarded force proportional to 1/r5), in contrast to the 1/r6 depen-
dence for the case of the interaction energy between two electrically polarizable atoms. Though
here we discuss a simple model, this drastic change is fully justiﬁed in a QED calculation [9].
The retarded interaction energy between two atoms with both electrically and magnetically
polarizations was calculated for the ﬁrst time by Feinberg and Sucher [10] and is given by (see
also a detailed discussion in reference [11]:

U(r) = [−23 (α1α2 + β1β2) + 7 (α1β2 + α2β1)]

4πr7 ,

1The Casimir eﬀect is more general than that, since it occurs whenever a relativistic ﬁeld (not only the
electromagnetic one) is constrained by some boundary conditions or is considered in a topologically non-trivial
manifold [8]

where in Eq.(1 ) αi is the (static) polarizability and βi is the (static) magnetic polarizability, but,
as far as the authors are aware of, no one in literature had considered the non-retarded case until
very recently [9], where the authors show, with the aid of perturbative quantum electrodynamics
techniques, that the non-retarded dispersion van der Waals interaction potential for the case
at hand obeys a 1/r4 law and not the 1/r6 law as one would naively think. It is the purpose of
this note to obtain this rather surprising result in a much simpler way, which we think can be
understood by any undergraduate student who is familiar with introductory electromagnetism
and ordinary quantum mechanics.

Our procedure will be based on the dipole ﬂuctuating method as discussed for instantce in
references [4, 5, 6]. To this eﬀect we model the electric polarizable molecule by an electric charge
e of mass me which oscillates harmonically along a ﬁxed, but arbitrary direction deﬁned by the
unit vector ˆue, so that the atom is eﬀectively replaced by an electric dipole p(t) = exe(t)ˆue,
where xe measures the position along the oscillation axis taking the origin at the equilibrium
position. The magnetically polarizable atom will be replaced by a magnetic charge g of mass
mg which, similarly to its electric counterpart, also oscillates harmonically along another ﬁxed,
but arbitrary direction deﬁned by the unit vector ˆug. Eﬀectively we have a magnetic dipole
m(t) = g xg(t) ˆug playing the role of the magnetically polarizable atom. Each dipole is the
source of electric and magnetic ﬁelds that pervade all space. Each dipole also probes the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds created by the other.

The electric and magnetic ﬁelds at a point of the space identiﬁed by the position vector r

created by an electric dipole are given by [12]:

Eq(r, t) = [3 (p(t∗) · ˆr) ˆr − p(t∗)]

− [¨p(t∗) − (¨p(t∗) · ˆr) ˆr]

and

¨p(t∗)(cid:21) × ˆr .

where r is the distance from the dipole to the point of observation and t∗ = t − r/c is the
retarded time. The ﬁelds generated by a magnetic dipole can be obtained by means of the
substitutions p → m, E → B and B → −E [12]. The Lorentz force acting on the electric
dipole whose position is identiﬁed by the vector re at a given instant of time t is

Fe(re, t) = eEg(re, t∗) +

ve(t) × Bg(re, t∗) .

In the same way, the Lorentz force acting on the magnetic dipole will be given by:

Fg(rg, t) = gBe(rg, t∗) −

vg(t) × Ee(rg, t∗).

(5)

If we project these forces along the directions deﬁned by the (ﬁxed) unit vectors ˆue and ˆug,
neglect retardament and radiation reaction, and take into account the forces that bind the
oscillating electric and magnetic charges to their respective centers of force by simulating them
through Hookean forces, we end up with a coupled system of linear diﬀerential equations which
reads

where ωe and ωg are, respectively, the natural frequencies of the electric and magnetic dipoles.
If the dipoles are not very far from each other (r ≪ 137a0, where a0 is Bohr’s radius, see for
instance [6]), the dominant term leads to:

¨xe(t) + ω2

exe(t) = F (r) ˙xg(t)

where F (r) := + eg

where H(r) := + eg
mg cr2 (ˆue × ˆreg) · ˆug. Equations (8) and (9) form system of coupled diﬀerential
equations that can be solved in the usual way, i.e., we try a solution of the form xi(t) =
Ci exp(−iωt), where Ci
is a complex constant with i = e, g, thereby obtaining the following
algebraic equation:

Ω2 − (cid:16)ω2

e + ω2

g − F (r)H(r)(cid:17) Ω + ω2

e ω2

g = 0.

(10)

where Ω := ω2. If we set F (r)H(r) = 0 we can easiliy verify that the roots of the above equation
are real and given by Ω1 = ω2
g as expected. The roots of Eq.(10 ) satisfy the
simple relations

e and Ω2 = ω2

Ω1 + Ω2 = ω2

e + ω2

S := (ω1 + ω2)2 − (ωe + ωg)2 ,

where ω1 and ω2 are two real positive roots of the original algebraic equation of the fourth
degree for ω. Using the simple properties given by Eqs.(11) and (12) we ﬁnd

where we have rewritten the last term, which is the interaction potential, so that the electric
and magnetic polarizabilities α = e2

Qeg := (ˆug × ˆreg) · ˆue is a spatial orientation factor to be properly averaged. The force between
the electrically polarizable atom and the magnetically polarizable one is repulsive as expected,
but it varies with the inverse ﬁﬁth power of the separation:

(17)

The 1/r4 behavior of (16) (or the 1/r5 behavior of (17) can be traced back to the near ﬁeld
approximation of the electromagnetic ﬁelds involved, which contribute to the problem with
terms varying with 1/r2 and to the fact that terms stemming from the vector products in the
equations of motion are zero. Take, for instance, the magnetically polarizable atom. There are
two forces acting on it: the ﬁrst one is due to the magnetic ﬁeld created by the ﬂuctuating
electri dipole of the other atom, which does not have the typical 1/r3 behaviour of a static
zone ﬁeld; the second one is due to the cross product between the magnetic charge velocity
(~vg) and the electric ﬁeld generated by the electric ﬂuctuating dipole ( ~Ee). However, though ~Ee
exhibits the static zone term (proportional to 1/r3), this term disappears from the calculation
when projected into the ﬁxed (but arbitrary) direction of motion of the magnetic charge g. An
analogous explanation holds for the electric polarizable atom. We conclude, then, that this
is a very peculiar result whose origin lies in the fact that one of the atoms is only electrically
polarizable and the other, only magnetically polarizable. Had we started with two magnetically
polarizable atoms, we would have obtained a non-dispersive interaction energy proportional to
1/r6.

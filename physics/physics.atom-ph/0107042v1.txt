I. INTRODUCTION

Clearly deﬁned spectrum is the main requirement for any spectroscopical methods, which
deal with two close isotopes as Li 6 and Li 7 , Is preferable to use the atomic beams, where it is
easy to realize the excitation of single spectral line of Li 6 or Li 7 [1]. However there are many
publications devoted to the general study of Lithium vapor in the heat-pipe oven. There is
the Doppler broadening of spectral lines. It is necessary to have a stability and accuracy
frequency adjustments of the laser. Usually for Lithium atom the single mode laser operation
is need with stability and tuning of the laser frequency better then 1 GHz at the resonant
frequency. The ﬁrst known publication with Lithium resonance ionization spectroscopy
(RIS) was in 1977 [2].There were photo-ionization cross section going from the 2P level and
the demonstration of the ion current by varying the dye laser wavelength correspondent to
2S
2P transition. Therefore this was the ﬁrst work about the possibility of Lithium laser
isotope separation. Two years later the US patent for Lithium laser isotope separation was
accepted in 1979 [3]. The resonance ionization spectroscopy (RIS) of Lithium use two lasers
with diﬀerent frequencies. It is depend on intensities of both lasers for resonance excitation
at 2S
2P and for the ionization from 2P [4] (1982). The mixture of two gases in heat pipe
usually is present due to chemical activity of Lithium contacts with optical windows of the
heat-pipe oven. The Ar gas usually is present. Therefore one can to compare ions production
by RIS in the heat-pipe with another similar method for the Li
Ar contact ionization based
on the ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) isotope separation [5]. It should be noted here that
we shall not discuss the eﬀectiveness methods of isotope separation, but on the other hand,
both RIS and ICR can work more successfully at experiments where the concentration of
Lithium atoms is high. To achieve high values of concentration it is necessary to increase the
temperature of Li of a vapor chamber with the metallic Lithium. The ion generation process
is important for some applications at similar condition of environment. We consider collisions
at the experiment with heat-pipe oven, ﬁlled with Li
Ar mixture For such experiment the
electromagnetic properties of gas mixture play an important role due to relatively high
concentration of charged particles produced by emission, atomic collisions and proper RIS
for ionization. The geometric distribution of generated positive and negative particles in
the gas chamber is along the way of coaxial laser beams. If there is no voltage applied to
electrodes the small value of electric current is only due to atom - ﬁeld interaction. Because
the heat pipe oven has two electrodes with cylindrical symmetry and proper laser is as new
cylindrical electrode that produced charged particles along the laser way.

We are going to present: the simpliﬁed method for spectroscopic investigation of the
Ar mixture, based on methods of atomic collision estimations; the
dense vapor of Li
experimental setup for ionization experiment with lasers, precisely tuned on transition fre-
quency; the results of electric current measurements. The ion generation is with both the
RIS and without it. Last process is most interesting to that the ultra-violet radiation is ab-
sent and for achievement of a threshold of ionization is no suﬃciently only to excite 2S
2P
transition. In both cases the quantity of the charged particles can appear so large, that it
is possible to speak about presence low density plasma [6]. The measurement of the ex-
citation and ionization of dense lithium vapor by cw- dye laser with wavelength 610.3nm
were performed in Ref. [7]. In present work the result was obtained by using only 670.8nm
wavelength. When the DYE laser excite 2P-level at 1,848 eV it can not reach to 3D energy

−

level at 3,879 eV due to 2,031 eV diﬀerence for two steps excitation and it can lower the
ionization potential at 5,391 eV of Li atoms. For this reason we think that there is not a
special two-step absorption process, so we will to discuss two mechanisms such as associative
reaction and near resonance cooling.

II. SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DENSE LITHIUM VAPOR.

We begin with note that the main problem for such experiments is about the relative
values for concentrations of neutral atoms and molecules in the same Li vapor. Of course,
special measurements for molecules or clusters concentration are needed on time (for Li
[8] ). The standard experimental absorption intensity spec-
molecules studies see e.g. ref
2P of each Lithium isotopes has two spectral lines D1 and D2 [1] with
trum of the 2S
correspondence to level isotope shifts [9]. The Lithium 2S
2P has one doublet with dis-
tance of 10 GHz (0 ,012 nm) between D1 and D2 spectral lines. The isotope shift between
Li 6 D2 (670 ,7922 nm) and Li 7 D2 ( 670 , 7764 nm) is 10 ,5333 GHz and between Li 6 D1
(670 ,8073 nm) and Li 7 D1 (670 ,7915 nm) is 10 ,5329 GHz [1].

Usually the observable at heat-pipe experiment 2S

2P spectrum of natural Lithium
consists of three lines, where the central line is formed by the superposition of two lines
[3]. At heat-pipe experiments with the dense Li vapor
going from two diﬀerent isotopes
at high temperature, above 1000 K , all Gauss lines proﬁles can not been clearly observed.
There are only three observable normalized proﬁles of absorption intensity received from
experiment and ﬁtted numerically. The well known picture of the ﬁne structure for each
isotope was not at high temperature heat pipe experiment, but particularly was revised with
two diode laser for calibration.

The Voight proﬁle approach can be applied for simple analysis of the Doppler broadened
line and for the Lorenzian line, which widths are related to the correspondent Gauss to
Lorentz (G/L) damping constant. With known value of the (G/L) damping constant from
ﬁtted proﬁle, it is easy to obtain the line width for Lorentzian proﬁle and evaluate the
summary of excitation transfer mechanisms. Also special experiments and theory are needed
for detailed investigation of Li atoms collisions [10] - [13].

We use the method based on dense gas absorption intensity spectrum [Fig. 2] that can
be analytically described by empirical approximation for a Voight proﬁle of the absorbed
intensity in the Beer law, where the absorption coeﬃcient kabs is [14]:

kabs = kG

The absorption coeﬃcient for Gauss line proﬁles is kG . The coeﬃcient kG can be founded
numerically from ﬁtted proﬁles of absorption intensity, because the application of the Beer
law with absorption coeﬃcient as a constant, which no depend on Gauss distribution is no
correct for a dense vapor. Also at a maximum of one unsaturated line is possible to compare
kG form ﬁtted spectrum with the same value from the Beer law, therefore is possible to use
the thickness (8,5 cm) of dense vapor. There are two numerical parameters for normalized
proﬁle of intensity Iabs/I0 , where I0 is the intensity of the laser. One of these parameters
for Li 6 and Li 7 due to accordingly
is kG, which depend on spectral lines saturation, e.g.

3

concentrations. The η is the second numerical parameter. It dependent on wings of spectral
line at frequency ν, which are far from the central line ν0 for both isotopes:

For unsaturated spectral lines, as for left spectral proﬁle in the [ Fig. 1 ], that corresponds
to Li 6 , the parameter η leads to the function F for the Voight proﬁle:

The Eq. (3) is used only for the ﬁtting Li 6 spectral lines, because the parameter η for Li 6 is
not too large as for Li 7 , due to the relative concentrations of these isotopes. For Li 7 isotope
spectral line the saturation is much more greater than for Li 6 , thus in this case the Voight
proﬁle must be ﬁtted by using the other sequence:

By ﬁtting the experimental spectrum with above method is possible to obtain a better result
with experiment for each spectral line. Also another empirical approximation of Voight
proﬁle [15] can be used successfully for all spectral lines at the narrow part of frequency
spectrum.

The (G/L) damping constants for both Li 6 D1 and Li 7 D2 have the same values a7 =
0 .0005 and both absorption coeﬃcients for Li 7 and Li 6 were estimated from

a6 = 0 .021

length 670,7764 nm for Li 7 and 670,8073 nm for Li 6 . At temperature T = 831 .84K and
pressure 1.8torr, the full width of the half maximum (FWHM) is ∆νG6 = 3763.17MHz for
Li 6 D1 and ∆νG7 = 3484.58MHz for Li 7 D2 .

For correspondent Lorentzian proﬁles one can easy to calculate the FWHM equal to

∆νLi6 = 94.92MHz for Li 6 D1 and ∆νLi7 = 87.89MHz for Li 7 D2 .

Therefore, with the temperature about 650 K , the random velocity of the Li

Ar
atoms vapor is about 160 000 cm/s and the correspondent Doppler shift for one laser wave
is about 16 GHz . There are some experimental possibilities for measurements. When the
laser has frequency scanning along spectrum of Lithium, the relative datum can be used
for the line position in the spectrum due to the Doppler shift for each wavelengths. The
Doppler-free method, that used two opposite propagated beams with the same frequency on
the each laser beam is free of the Doppler shift for detectors, thus the Lorentzian proﬁle can
be experimentally received, but only calibrated relative scale of the frequency can be used for
estimation of the Lorentzian proﬁle. Therefore the 20 GHz scale between known spectral
lines captured from the literature datum for Li is no good for Doppler-free experimental
estimations of the Lorentzian proﬁle in the gas chamber, because expected value of the
FWHM is about 100 MHz and special calibration laser air wavelength is needed. Also if the
one of two laser beams is controlled by wave meter and another laser is controlled by a power
meter or by photo diode with oscilloscope, thus the resolution of the wave meter is about
0,0002 nm or 133 MHz at 670 nm and can not permit well accuracy for experiments with a
Heat-pipe oven where all spectral lines are Doppler broadened and saturated. The 2S
2P
transition of Lithium isotopes is well known for the all 4 principal spectral lines including
the ﬁne structures (fs). Each atom has the lowest 2S level with two (fs) levels, which can
be observed only at the special experiment with electric or magnetic ﬁelds. The distance
between both fs levels is 803 MHz for 2S and 18 MHz for 2P level. Yet, we can put ﬁne
structures (fs) out of our consideration the resonance 2S
2P transition with resonance
1015rad ./s., because the Doppler - free method can not to permit the
frequency ω0 = 2, 8

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The selection and speciﬁcation of special designed lasers instrumentation for selective
excitation of lithium isotopes and full ionization is important because of the small frequency
distance between the lithium lines is present and it is necessary to study some laser spectral
stability characteristics. The experimental setup [ Fig. 2] consists of three lasers which path
is the same route across the heat-pipe oven. This is possible by use properties of Glan prisms
and rotators of polarization.

The lasers wavelength was controlled by a serial pulsed Burleigh wave meter Model WA
4500 with accuracy 0,0001 - 0,0002 nm at wavelength range from 1100 nm to 400 nm . The
laser line shape was measured by use of a Burleigh Spectrum Analyzer System SA 385 with
Its maximum speciﬁed resolution is 27 MHz using 8 GHz FSR
SA-91 Etalon Assembly.
mirror set with ﬁnesse about 300 and the transmission more then 10 as a Fabry-Perot ﬁlter
with thermal sensitivity 70 nm/oC changing in mirrors spacing.

The laser power was measured with a cw - Laser Power Meter, Spectra Physics, Mod
407 A. It has a wavelength range 250 -1100 nm, power range from 5 mW to 20 W with
sensitivity variation about 1 because the damage peak energy density is 0,3 J /cm 2 at 50 ns
pulses. Also the 818 UV, Newport Power Meter was used for precisely measured power of
low intensity cw - lasers.

For the ionization process we used a High Power Q-Switched, TEM 00 frequency-doubled
Nd-YAG Lee Laser, Model 815TQ. The power stability was 10 1064 nm was 15 W at 5

5

kHz repetition rate (pulse energy 2 ,2 mJ and pulse duration 90 ns) and the intensity
3 MW /cm2 .
In this conﬁguration the second harmonic wavelength (532 nm) is emitted
laterally from the optical axis of the laser resonator. The SHG assembly contains a KTP
(potassium titanyl phosphate crystal) which is bounced inside a temperature controlled
chamber. Because of the small crystal cross section (4 x 4 mm) ), there is a little box for
misalignment of the crystal with the Nd-YAG beam optical center line. The average power
was 2,5 W , the average energy was 0,5 mJ and the pulse duration was 100 ns. We worked
with 1,5 W for obtaining UV 266 nm. For this purpose we used an INRAD temperature
stabilized crystal of KDP , obtaining 40 mW of the average power. The non-critical phase
matching temperature (35 oC - 75 oC ) is quite dependent on the deuteration level of the
KDP . Also the incoming edge of the crystal is at 90 o with the optical axis of the crystal and
the reﬂection at the angle about 23 o decrease the intensity of 532 nm about two times. The
lineal polarization of 532 nm going from the LEE laser had an inclination with the angle
45 o respect to the optical path of our experiment. The specially oriented crystal KDP for
second harmonic generation (SHG) was needed. From two waves within one laser beam
with λ = 532 nm the well known procedure of the second harmonic generation was used.
The wave with λ = 266 nm We obtained a UV-beam at 266 nm with intensity 16 kW /cm 2
after the prism separation from incoming 532 nm wave. The line width of the UV line was
20 MHz with high frequency stability. Frequency stability of the ionization laser is no so
critical as for the excitation process, because for ionization we have a transition from 2P to
above ionization limit.

The group of calibration lasers consist both the 6202 NewFocus diode laser and the EOSI
diode laser with line width about 100 KHz and the average power 6 mW . These lasers was
used for calibrating the experiment due to high stability parameters at the needed wave
length.

We tested a cw - broadband standing-wave Spectra Physics DYE Laser (Model 375 B),
because we can change the mode structure of outgoing laser wave as a special background
[16]. The DYE laser was pumped by a power P0 = 6W , Sta-
for given laser equipment
bility Multiline Ar-Ion Laser Spectra Physics Model 2017 -06 S. The Ar-ion laser had some
measurable spectral lines, such as: at 514,5 nm with 0,393 P0 , at 496,5nm with 0,166 P0 ,
at 488 nm with 0,285 P0 , at 476,5nm with 0,109 P0 , at 457,9 nm with 0,047P0 . The
amplitude stability of the DYE laser intensity was best with pumping of the Ar-Ion laser
at 514,5 nm. The DYE laser was based on DCM 4 -(Dicyanomethylene) - 2 -(methyl )
- 6 -(p
dimethylaminostyryl )- 4-H -(pyran) with molecular weight 303,37 a.u. and con-
centration 1,5 (mmole/l ) , which was prepared when 0 ,682g of the DCM was solved in
Prophylene carbonate (0 ,6 l ) and Ethylene Glycol (0,9 l ). The absorption curve of DCM
has an absorbency region between 450 nm and 550 nm . The broad band emission curve
has the FWHM about 80 nm at 650 nm, which is close to the resonance 2S
2P tran-
sition of Lithium at 671 nm. The Spectra Physics data for the Model 375 B laser were:
power 600 mW at 705 nm, line width 7 GHz , amplitude stability less then 0 ,5 accuracy
of wavelength changing 0 ,5 nm. The limit of wavelength changing is in the same order as
a Rayleigh selection rule for spectral lines 8/π2, that is about 0,5 nm for a given laser line
width. We obtained characteristics of Spectra Physics DYE laser, Model 375 B, such as:
average power 1 ,2 W at 671 nm , accuracy of changing wavelength better then 0,01 nm
and frequency stability about 0,0001 nm/hour during time of the experiment. All parame-

ters are depended on needed laser modes structure and corresponds to properties of optical
elements inside the resonator. For our experiments with Li we modiﬁed the mode structure
and the spectral line width of outgoing laser wave by inserting an additional etalon into a
laser resonator. We note that broadband laser had the tuning accuracy 0,5 nm without E1
due to BF frequency tuning accuracy. With BF and E1 the frequency tuning accuracy was
0,0001 nm. The ﬁrst air spaced etalon (E1 ) had a temperature stability. When
measured
the BF and E1 were used, the output frequency of the DYE laser was tuned to the quite
1014Hz by used the angle and temperature tuning of E1 . The FSR
frequency 4,46789597
·
of output frequency was 19,655 GHz . Then the second etalon E2 , with FSR = 15 GHz
was installed inside the cavity and the same operation was repeated with angle tuning of
E2 for the same frequency. The E2 was chosen, because the spectral lines of the Lithium
have 10 Ghz distance twice between 3 spectral lines and laser with BF and E1 can excite
both Li 6 and Li 7 . The single mode operation of the broad band laser was achieved. The
single mode selection was realized experimentally [Fig. 2] by use the aperture with diameter
1 mm for transverse mode selection and, by use two etalons (E1 , E2 ) and the birefringent
ﬁlter (BF ) for longitudinal mode selection. The mode structure of the single laser beam is
very important for selective excitation. There are some experimental possibilities with the
broad band DYE laser, which depend on needed experiments. The sngle mode operation
was necessary for a RIS experiments. On the contrary for measured values of electric cur-
rent [Fig.3] of the laser induced low density plasma observation experiment
[6], the DYE
laser had the two longitudinal modes with FWHM 100 MHz , separated exactly at 20 GHz
with cavity etalon. This etalon had the free spectral range (FSR) that correspondent the
distance between two spectral lines of Li 6 and Li 7 isotopes of the natural Lithium vapor.
The laser was tuned exactly on 670.8073 nm for Li 6 . Another wavelength 670.7716 nm was
not controlled. The average power at this experiment was 100 mW . There are some known
methods of longitudinal mode selection by use interferometers techniques as in [17], [18].
The free spectral range FSR is equal to the distance between two longitudinal modes:

Thus, with variation of the angle, some longitudinal modes of the laser will have not losses
for correspondent frequencies ν = m, (FSR), and it is possible to move the Airy spectrum
of the etalon along the frequency axis up or down to quite position. The longitudinal modes
are spaced in frequency by c/2L. We note that for near-confocal resonator the free spectral
range (FSR) is:

where (x ) - is the distance from the axis and ρ is the radius of mirrors, when L = ρ. Thus the
series of longitudinal modes are separated by c/4L
30 cm.
Transverse modes are important for a mode selection too. Amplitude distribution of these
modes is given with Hermit polynomial TEM mn modes. The separation of the ﬁrst transverse
mode (m = 0 , n = 1 ) from the axial mode is:

where (r ) is diameter of cylindrical laser material.
In deriving the Van Cittert-Zernike
theorem [19] it follows that the diﬀraction pattern would be obtained on replacing the
source (the DYE luminescence cross section) by a diﬀraction aperture of the same size and
shape as the source. The amplitude distribution over the wave front in the aperture being
proportional to the intensity distribution across the source. The calculation of the complex
degree of coherence of light from an incoherent source, by use the Hopkins formula [19],
leads to the mirrors diameter 0,32 λf /h, where (f )- is focal distances , h
10 µm - is the
diameter of the source, that dependent on a pumping of the focused laser (6 W Ar-Ion laser)
and thermal lens. At ﬂow velocities of the DYE about 10 m/s the time of ﬂight for the
dye molecules through the focus is about 1 µs. By using a mirror whose reﬂectively can be
varied over its surface, it is possible to have some given combination of transverse modes, if
it is necessary.

There are two problems of frequency stability of the DYE laser. Firstly, we note that
the material of installed cavity DYE laser etalon was fused silica. Regardless of thickness
it has a drift of airspace between fused silica plates about 5 GHz /oC and would have to
be temperature stable about 0,1 oC /hour. Secondly, the environment conditions are very
important for stable laser experiment with atomic spectral lines. Therefore, there is the
frequency drift:

where (d ) is the cavity length and (n) is the refraction coeﬃcient. For the quartz rod
resonator structure of the DYE laser,Model375D, we have with respect to the change of
a cavity length a resulting temperature sensitivity about 90 MHz /0 C . With respect to
the refraction coeﬃcient of air we found a temperature sensitivity about 410 MHz /oC .
The amplitude and frequency stability of the laser was maintained during 3 hours of the
experiment. The wavelength control had the accuracy 0.0001 nm by use the serial wave
meter. The measured value of the line width was about 100 MHz for cw -regime of DYE
Ion laser. Another excitation of the same DYE laser was
excitation by use the focused Ar
with 120 ns pulses of twice doubled Nd:YAG laser at 266 nm, with 5 KHz pulse repetition
and average power about 1 W . Output pulses from the DYE laser were 100 ns.

concentrations is N6 /N7 = 0.08135, which is in well agreement with the characteristics of
natural Lithium [20].

·

On the other hand, one can to verify values of Lithium concentration by use the following

well known formula for the Lithium vapor pressure (in torr ) at ﬁxed temperature (in K ):

P = 105,055− 8023
T ,

(14)

where the vapor pressure for given temperature is equal to 0.003427 Pa = 0.0000257 torr .
By using the equation of the state for ideal gas P = Nk B T and Eq.(10 ), one can obtain
1010cm −3 . The Heat-pipe
the concentration of the natural Lithium, which is equal to 29.85
was ﬁlled with Ar gas with the concentration 1017cm −3 .

When resonance excitation of the considered system Li (2 2 S )

(2 2 P) was realized by
671 nm cw-laser, the ionization process was registered. The result of ionization by 671 nm
2P energy level (1,848 eV )
was compared with additional UV laser for ionization from 2S
to energy level of ionization limit (5,391 eV ).

Intensity values of both the cw-DYE laser and the pulsed UV laser were changed corre-
spondingly to the beam diameter 3 mm across the heat-pipe oven. We did not worked with
specially applied to the heat-pipe electrodes voltage or load resistors.

Direct measurements of the electric current were performed by amper meter; maximum
average value of the electric current was registered about 30µA [ Fig. 3 ]. We denoted three
curves, where three principal eﬀects were registered such as: (a) is the upper dependence
for the RIS by use excitation and ionization from two lasers 671nm and 266nm. The RIS
is more eﬀective between 450oC and 650oC. (b) is the ionization current due to only 2S-2P
excitation with 671nm. This speciﬁc ionization is more eﬀective for highest temperatures.
(c) is the lowest dependence (the noise) for a emission. Only small diﬀerence between average
value of electric current due to the RIS process [ Fig. 3 -(a)] and to resonance excitation
2P [ Fig. 3 -(b) ]. The noise or the emission in temperature range from 450oC up
2S
to 700oC with electric current up to 3µA and capacitance up to 20nF with observable
saturation [ Fig. 3 -(c) ]. Values of the electric current varies from 5µA up to 30µA [ Fig. 3
-(a)], and capacitance from 10nF up to 100nF . Also the capacitance of cylindrical heat-pipe
was measured. The results of the current and capacitance measurements at the temperature
higher than 650oC are the same for both mechanisms. Also it is easy to separate RIS from
another ionization using the modulation signal measurements because RIS use the pulse UV
laser.

V. SOME MECHANISMS OF COLLISIONS

If the colliding particles have no charge, the trajectory r (t) is assumed to be rectilinear:
r (t) = ρ + vt , where ρ and v are the impact parameter and relative velocity. The elastic
collisions change the phase of damped oscillator, φ(t), but not the amplitude, x (t), due to
the frequency shift ∆ω during the phase-perturbing collisions. If the duration of collision,
τc, is short compared with the mean time between two consecutive collisions, one can neglect
the radiation during collisions and consider the collisions to be instantaneous. Therefore the
collisions are manifested only in phase shifts (Impact broadening approximation), where the

9

≪

dimension parameter h = ρ3NAr
1 determines the number of perturbers in the Weisskopf
sphere with the radius ρ, where the binary approximation holds. Depending on the type and
states of interacting atoms both attraction and repulsion can take place at long distances.
At short distances the potential is repulsive. In general case the interaction force is depends
not only on spatial but also on angular variables. The results of calculations in which a more
realistic interaction r −6 is used can not be described by a simple Lorentzian distribution,
that depends on the type of the transition. The repulsive part of the interaction is usually
taken into account in the form of Lennard-Jones potential. In general case, when the mean
distance between the atoms is of the same order with the magnitude of atomic dimensions,

Such a process would be possible if the excited lithium atoms approached each other with

The simple approximation (18) shows that above associative ionization reaction can

provide the electron densities up to ne
-(b) ]. As for the rather high current observed even in the case when both lasers (DYE and
UV) are shut down [Fig. 3 - (c)], such value of electron gas density can be achieved due
to the eﬀects of emission, mainly from the internal hot electrode with a mesh plating by
Lithium.

The space-charge average current in Heat-pipe can be estimated by using the Child

equation [26], due to the presence of cylindrical symmetry:

where the parameter (β) was determined in the Ref. [26] and (a) is the radius of the external
cylinder. The mean values for current and dielectric constant can be taken directly from
current and capacitance measurements.

Given the natural line width equal to 5,8 MHz for the 2P - energy level we obtain the

absorption cross section

where A2p−2s = 1 /ts , with ts = 27 ,1 ns. The Doppler line width of the Li was ∆νD

The one-dimensional systems of driven charges can change symmetry in the phase pulses
space, when the classical phenomena in one direction take into account quantization in
others. It results in thermal drag eﬀects in solids wires [28], but can result in thermal optical
experiments too. Another eﬀect is light-induced diﬀusive pulling (pushing) of lithium atoms
into a laser beam, which was studied in Ar noble gas, where the value of diﬀusion coeﬃcient
4.3cm 2 /s was measured [29].

It should be noted here, that the peak concentration of charged particles produced by
the RIS [ Fig. 3 -(a) ] using 77 ns UV pulses is much more higher than the measured average
value.

By other hand we can discuss another mechanism for observed ionization .

We will take the Doppler cooling as the one step to achieve the low temperature for the
Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) at very low temperature. The limit of the temperature
achieved for Lithium is 140 µK by balance with a scattering force in a random direction [30].
The Doppler limit of achievable temperature (T ) is:

The well known saturation eﬀect by intensity of the laser is clearly observed. Is possible to ﬁx
at experiment both the frequency ∆ω and the laser intensity I . Therefore, the correspondent
ρ must depend on the intensity [ Fig. 4 ] or on the frequency [ Fig. 5]. The simplest calculation
show that the saturation is at ∆ω
Ω. As the Γ is
return size of the time, it is possible to transfer a condition of saturation to language of the
time-table interaction [32]. At the ﬁxed frequency [ Fig. 4 ], when increase of intensity of
the laser, the saturation comes at the maximal size of Γ, that corresponds to the minimal
time. Very important the fact of weak growth is that means that the time too gradually
decreases aspiring to a limit. On the other hand at a weak intensity the time is very large
also grows indeﬁnitely. At the ﬁxed size of intensity of the laser [ Fig. 5], the condition of an
exact resonance coincides with a condition when time is equally practically to zero and then
it is gradually increased to indeﬁnitely in process of a distance from a resonance [32]. If now
to put in conformity a parity between frequency ∆ω of a ﬁeld and k

interaction or time of life [32], but also about speeds of atoms, because it is supposed that

With relation between k

to connection of the temperature with the atomic velocity. Other atoms have conserved
high velocities. Therefore the inelastic collisions should be expected. The general velocity
distribution can be changed and the satellite distribution can be observed due to laser
induced collisions between atoms.

I. INTRODUCTION

Clearly de(cid:12)ned spectrum is the main requirement for any spectroscopical methods, which

deal with two close isotopes as Li

and Li

, Is preferable to use the atomic beams, where it is

6

7

easy to realize the excitation of single spectral line of Li

or Li

[1]. However there are many

6

7

publications devoted to the general study of Lithium vapor in the heat-pipe oven. There is

the Doppler broadening of spectral lines. It is necessary to have a stability and accuracy

frequency adjustments of the laser. Usually for Lithium atom the single mode laser operation

is need with stability and tuning of the laser frequency better then 1 GHz at the resonant

frequency. The (cid:12)rst known publication with Lithium resonance ionization spectroscopy

(RIS) was in 1977 [2].There were photo-ionization cross section going from the 2P level and

the demonstration of the ion current by varying the dye laser wavelength correspondent to

2S (cid:0) 2P transition. Therefore this was the (cid:12)rst work about the possibility of Lithium laser

isotope separation. Two years later the US patent for Lithium laser isotope separation was

accepted in 1979 [3]. The resonance ionization spectroscopy (RIS) of Lithium use two lasers

with di(cid:11)erent frequencies. It is depend on intensities of both lasers for resonance excitation

at 2S (cid:0) 2P and for the ionization from 2P [4] (1982). The mixture of two gases in heat pipe

usually is present due to chemical activity of Lithium contacts with optical windows of the

heat-pipe oven. The Ar gas usually is present. Therefore one can to compare ions production

by RIS in the heat-pipe with another similar method for the Li (cid:0) Ar contact ionization based

on the ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) isotope separation [5]. It should be noted here that

we shall not discuss the e(cid:11)ectiveness methods of isotope separation, but on the other hand,

both RIS and ICR can work more successfully at experiments where the concentration of

Lithium atoms is high. To achieve high values of concentration it is necessary to increase the

temperature of Li of a vapor chamber with the metallic Lithium. The ion generation process

is important for some applications at similar condition of environment. We consider collisions

at the experiment with heat-pipe oven, (cid:12)lled with Li (cid:0) Ar mixture For such experiment the

electromagnetic properties of gas mixture play an important role due to relatively high

concentration of charged particles produced by emission, atomic collisions and proper RIS

for ionization. The geometric distribution of generated positive and negative particles in

the gas chamber is along the way of coaxial laser beams. If there is no voltage applied to

electrodes the small value of electric current is only due to atom - (cid:12)eld interaction. Because

the heat pipe oven has two electrodes with cylindrical symmetry and proper laser is as new

cylindrical electrode that produced charged particles along the laser way.

We are going to present: the simpli(cid:12)ed method for spectroscopic investigation of the

dense vapor of Li (cid:0) Ar mixture, based on methods of atomic collision estimations; the

experimental setup for ionization experiment with lasers, precisely tuned on transition fre-

quency; the results of electric current measurements. The ion generation is with both the

RIS and without it. Last process is most interesting to that the ultra-violet radiation is ab-

sent and for achievement of a threshold of ionization is no su(cid:14)ciently only to excite 2S (cid:0) 2P

transition. In both cases the quantity of the charged particles can appear so large, that it

is possible to speak about presence low density plasma [6]. The measurement of the ex-

citation and ionization of dense lithium vapor by cw- dye laser with wavelength 610:3nm

were performed in Ref. [7]. In present work the result was obtained by using only 670:8nm

wavelength. When the DYE laser excite 2P -level at 1,848 eV it can not reach to 3D energy

2

level at 3,879 eV due to 2,031 eV di(cid:11)erence for two steps excitation and it can lower the

ionization potential at 5,391 eV of Li atoms. For this reason we think that there is not a

special two-step absorption process, so we will to discuss two mechanisms such as associative

reaction and near resonance cooling.

II. SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DENSE LITHIUM VAPOR.

We begin with note that the main problem for such experiments is about the relative

values for concentrations of neutral atoms and molecules in the same Li vapor. Of course,

special measurements for molecules or clusters concentration are needed on time (for Li

molecules studies see e.g. ref

[8] ). The standard experimental absorption intensity spec-

trum of the 2S (cid:0) 2P of each Lithium isotopes has two spectral lines D1 and D2 [1] with

correspondence to level isotope shifts [9]. The Lithium 2S (cid:0) 2P has one doublet with dis-

tance of 10 GHz (0 ,012 nm ) between D1 and D2 spectral lines. The isotope shift between

Li

D2 (670 ,7922 nm ) and Li

D2 ( 670 , 7764 nm ) is 10 ,5333 GHz and between Li

D1

6

7

6

(670 ,8073 nm ) and Li

D1 (670 ,7915 nm ) is 10 ,5329 GHz [1].

7

Usually the observable at heat-pipe experiment 2S (cid:0) 2P spectrum of natural Lithium

consists of three lines, where the central line is formed by the superposition of two lines

going from two di(cid:11)erent isotopes

[3]. At heat-pipe experiments with the dense Li vapor

at high temperature, above 1000 K , all Gauss lines pro(cid:12)les can not been clearly observed.

There are only three observable normalized pro(cid:12)les of absorption intensity received from

experiment and (cid:12)tted numerically. The well known picture of the (cid:12)ne structure for each

isotope was not at high temperature heat pipe experiment, but particularly was revised with

two diode laser for calibration.

The Voight pro(cid:12)le approach can be applied for simple analysis of the Doppler broadened

line and for the Lorenzian line, which widths are related to the correspondent Gauss to

Lorentz (G =L) damping constant. With known value of the (G =L) damping constant from

(cid:12)tted pro(cid:12)le, it is easy to obtain the line width for Lorentzian pro(cid:12)le and evaluate the

summary of excitation transfer mechanisms. Also special experiments and theory are needed

for detailed investigation of Li atoms collisions [10] - [13].

We use the method based on dense gas absorption intensity spectrum [Fig. 2] that can

be analytically described by empirical approximation for a Voight pro(cid:12)le of the absorbed

intensity in the Beer law, where the absorption coe(cid:14)cient k

is [14]:

can be founded

numerically from (cid:12)tted pro(cid:12)les of absorption intensity, because the application of the Beer

law with absorption coe(cid:14)cient as a constant, which no depend on Gauss distribution is no

correct for a dense vapor. Also at a maximum of one unsaturated line is possible to compare

k

form (cid:12)tted spectrum with the same value from the Beer law, therefore is possible to use

pro(cid:12)le [15] can be used successfully for all spectral lines at the narrow part of frequency

spectrum.

Therefore, with the temperature about 650 K , the random velocity of the Li (cid:0) Ar

atoms vapor is about 160 000 cm =s and the correspondent Doppler shift for one laser wave

is about 16 GHz . There are some experimental possibilities for measurements. When the

laser has frequency scanning along spectrum of Lithium, the relative datum can be used

for the line position in the spectrum due to the Doppler shift for each wavelengths. The

Doppler-free method, that used two opposite propagated beams with the same frequency on

the each laser beam is free of the Doppler shift for detectors, thus the Lorentzian pro(cid:12)le can

be experimentally received, but only calibrated relative scale of the frequency can be used for

estimation of the Lorentzian pro(cid:12)le. Therefore the 20 GHz scale between known spectral

lines captured from the literature datum for Li is no good for Doppler-free experimental

estimations of the Lorentzian pro(cid:12)le in the gas chamber, because expected value of the

FWHM is about 100 MHz and special calibration laser air wavelength is needed. Also if the

one of two laser beams is controlled by wave meter and another laser is controlled by a power

meter or by photo diode with oscilloscope, thus the resolution of the wave meter is about

0,0002 nm or 133 MHz at 670 nm and can not permit well accuracy for experiments with a

Heat-pipe oven where all spectral lines are Doppler broadened and saturated. The 2S (cid:0) 2P

transition of Lithium isotopes is well known for the all 4 principal spectral lines including

the (cid:12)ne structures (fs ). Each atom has the lowest 2S level with two (fs ) levels, which can

be observed only at the special experiment with electric or magnetic (cid:12)elds. The distance

between both fs levels is 803 MHz for 2S and 18 MHz for 2P level. Yet, we can put (cid:12)ne

structures (fs ) out of our consideration the resonance 2S (cid:0) 2P transition with resonance

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The selection and speci(cid:12)cation of special designed lasers instrumentation for selective

excitation of lithium isotopes and full ionization is important because of the small frequency

distance between the lithium lines is present and it is necessary to study some laser spectral

stability characteristics. The experimental setup [ Fig. 2] consists of three lasers which path

is the same route across the heat-pipe oven. This is possible by use properties of Glan prisms

and rotators of polarization.

The lasers wavelength was controlled by a serial pulsed Burleigh wave meter Model WA

4500 with accuracy 0,0001 - 0,0002 nm at wavelength range from 1100 nm to 400 nm . The

laser line shape was measured by use of a Burleigh Spectrum Analyzer System SA 385 with

SA-91 Etalon Assembly.

Its maximum speci(cid:12)ed resolution is 27 MHz using 8 GHz FSR

mirror set with (cid:12)nesse about 300 and the transmission more then 10 as a Fabry-Perot (cid:12)lter

with thermal sensitivity 70 nm =

The laser power was measured with a cw - Laser Power Meter, Spectra Physics, Mod

407 A. It has a wavelength range 250 -1100 nm , power range from 5 mW to 20 W with

sensitivity variation about 1 because the damage peak energy density is 0,3 J =cm

pulses. Also the 818 UV, Newport Power Meter was used for precisely measured power of

low intensity cw - lasers.

For the ionization process we used a High Power Q -Switched, TEM

frequency-doubled

kHz repetition rate (pulse energy 2 ,2 mJ and pulse duration 90 ns ) and the intensity

3 MW =cm

.

In this con(cid:12)guration the second harmonic wavelength (532 nm ) is emitted

2

laterally from the optical axis of the laser resonator. The SHG assembly contains a KTP

(potassium titanyl phosphate crystal) which is bounced inside a temperature controlled

chamber. Because of the small crystal cross section (4 x 4 mm ) ), there is a little box for

misalignment of the crystal with the Nd-YAG beam optical center line. The average power

was 2,5 W , the average energy was 0,5 mJ and the pulse duration was 100 ns . We worked

with 1,5 W for obtaining UV 266 nm . For this purpose we used an INRAD temperature

stabilized crystal of KDP , obtaining 40 mW of the average power. The non-critical phase

matching temperature (35

C - 75

KDP . Also the incoming edge of the crystal is at 90

lineal polarization of 532 nm going from the LEE laser had an inclination with the angle

respect to the optical path of our experiment. The specially oriented crystal KDP for

second harmonic generation (SHG ) was needed. From two waves within one laser beam

with (cid:21) = 532 nm the well known procedure of the second harmonic generation was used.

The wave with (cid:21) = 266 nm We obtained a UV-beam at 266 nm with intensity 16 kW =cm

after the prism separation from incoming 532 nm wave. The line width of the UV line was

20 MHz with high frequency stability. Frequency stability of the ionization laser is no so

critical as for the excitation process, because for ionization we have a transition from 2P to

above ionization limit.

length.

The group of calibration lasers consist both the 6202 NewFocus diode laser and the EOSI

diode laser with line width about 100 KHz and the average power 6 mW . These lasers was

used for calibrating the experiment due to high stability parameters at the needed wave

We tested a cw - broadband standing-wave Spectra Physics DYE Laser (Model 375 B),

amplitude stability of the DYE laser intensity was best with pumping of the Ar-Ion laser

at 514,5 nm. The DYE laser was based on DCM 4 -(Dicyanomethylene ) - 2 -(methyl )

- 6 -(p (cid:0) dimethylaminostyryl )- 4-H -(pyran ) with molecular weight 303,37 a :u : and con-

centration 1,5 (mmole =l ) , which was prepared when 0 ,682g of the DCM was solved in

Prophylene carbonate (0 ,6 l ) and Ethylene Glycol (0,9 l ). The absorption curve of DCM

has an absorbency region between 450 nm and 550 nm . The broad band emission curve

has the FWHM about 80 nm at 650 nm , which is close to the resonance 2S (cid:0) 2P tran-

sition of Lithium at 671 nm . The Spectra Physics data for the Model 375 B laser were:

power 600 mW at 705 nm , line width 7 GHz , amplitude stability less then 0 ,5 accuracy

of wavelength changing 0 ,5 nm . The limit of wavelength changing is in the same order as

width. We obtained characteristics of Spectra Physics DYE laser, Model 375 B, such as:

average power 1 ,2 W at 671 nm , accuracy of changing wavelength better then 0,01 nm

and frequency stability about 0,0001 nm =hour during time of the experiment. All parame-

ters are depended on needed laser modes structure and corresponds to properties of optical

elements inside the resonator. For our experiments with Li we modi(cid:12)ed the mode structure

and the spectral line width of outgoing laser wave by inserting an additional etalon into a

laser resonator. We note that broadband laser had the tuning accuracy 0,5 nm without E1

due to BF frequency tuning accuracy. With BF and E1 the frequency tuning accuracy was

measured (cid:25)0,0001 nm . The (cid:12)rst air spaced etalon (E1 ) had a temperature stability. When

the BF and E1 were used, the output frequency of the DYE laser was tuned to the quite

frequency 4,46789597(cid:1)10

Hz by used the angle and temperature tuning of E1 . The FSR

14

of output frequency was 19,655 GHz . Then the second etalon E2 , with FSR = 15 GHz

was installed inside the cavity and the same operation was repeated with angle tuning of

E2 for the same frequency. The E2 was chosen, because the spectral lines of the Lithium

have 10 Ghz distance twice between 3 spectral lines and laser with BF and E1 can excite

both Li

and Li

. The single mode operation of the broad band laser was achieved. The

6

7

single mode selection was realized experimentally [Fig. 2] by use the aperture with diameter

1 mm for transverse mode selection and, by use two etalons (E1 ; E2 ) and the birefringent

(cid:12)lter (BF ) for longitudinal mode selection. The mode structure of the single laser beam is

very important for selective excitation. There are some experimental possibilities with the

broad band DYE laser, which depend on needed experiments. The sngle mode operation

was necessary for a RIS experiments. On the contrary for measured values of electric cur-

rent [Fig.3] of the laser induced low density plasma observation experiment [6], the DYE

laser had the two longitudinal modes with FWHM 100 MHz , separated exactly at 20 GHz

with cavity etalon. This etalon had the free spectral range (FSR) that correspondent the

distance between two spectral lines of Li

and Li

isotopes of the natural Lithium vapor.

The laser was tuned exactly on 670.8073 nm for Li

. Another wavelength 670.7716 nm was

6

not controlled. The average power at this experiment was 100 mW . There are some known

methods of longitudinal mode selection by use interferometers techniques as in [17], [18].

The free spectral range FSR is equal to the distance between two longitudinal modes:

F SR

Thus, with variation of the angle, some longitudinal modes of the laser will have not losses

for correspondent frequencies (cid:23) = m , (FSR), and it is possible to move the Airy spectrum

of the etalon along the frequency axis up or down to quite position. The longitudinal modes

are spaced in frequency by c =2L. We note that for near-confocal resonator the free spectral

range (FSR) is:

Transverse modes are important for a mode selection too. Amplitude distribution of these

In deriving the Van Cittert-Zernike

theorem [19] it follows that the di(cid:11)raction pattern would be obtained on replacing the

source (the DYE luminescence cross section) by a di(cid:11)raction aperture of the same size and

shape as the source. The amplitude distribution over the wave front in the aperture being

proportional to the intensity distribution across the source. The calculation of the complex

degree of coherence of light from an incoherent source, by use the Hopkins formula [19],

leads to the mirrors diameter 0,32 (cid:21)f =h , where (f )- is focal distances , h (cid:25) 10 (cid:22)m - is the

diameter of the source, that dependent on a pumping of the focused laser (6 W Ar-Ion laser)

and thermal lens. At (cid:13)ow velocities of the DYE about 10 m =s the time of (cid:13)ight for the

dye molecules through the focus is about 1 (cid:22)s . By using a mirror whose re(cid:13)ectively can be

varied over its surface, it is possible to have some given combination of transverse modes, if

it is necessary.

There are two problems of frequency stability of the DYE laser. Firstly, we note that

the material of installed cavity DYE laser etalon was fused silica. Regardless of thickness

it has a drift of airspace between fused silica plates about 5 GHz =

C and would have to

be temperature stable about 0,1

C =hour . Secondly, the environment conditions are very

important for stable laser experiment with atomic spectral lines. Therefore, there is the

frequency drift:

where (d ) is the cavity length and (n ) is the refraction coe(cid:14)cient. For the quartz rod

a cavity length a resulting temperature sensitivity about 90 MHz =

C . With respect to

the refraction coe(cid:14)cient of air we found a temperature sensitivity about 410 MHz =

The amplitude and frequency stability of the laser was maintained during 3 hours of the

experiment. The wavelength control had the accuracy 0.0001 nm by use the serial wave

meter. The measured value of the line width was about 100 MHz for cw -regime of DYE

excitation by use the focused Ar (cid:0) Ion laser. Another excitation of the same DYE laser was

with 120 ns pulses of twice doubled Nd:YAG laser at 266 nm, with 5 KHz pulse repetition

and average power about 1 W . Output pulses from the DYE laser were 100 ns .

was compared with additional UV laser for ionization from 2S (cid:0) 2P energy level (1,848 eV )

to energy level of ionization limit (5,391 eV ).

Intensity values of both the cw-DYE laser and the pulsed UV laser were changed corre-

spondingly to the beam diameter 3 mm across the heat-pipe oven. We did not worked with

specially applied to the heat-pipe electrodes voltage or load resistors.

Direct measurements of the electric current were performed by amper meter; maximum

average value of the electric current was registered about 30(cid:22)A [ Fig. 3 ]. We denoted three

curves, where three principal e(cid:11)ects were registered such as: (a) is the upper dependence

for the RIS by use excitation and ionization from two lasers 671nm and 266nm. The RIS

is more e(cid:11)ective between 450

excitation with 671nm. This speci(cid:12)c ionization is more e(cid:11)ective for highest temperatures.

(c) is the lowest dependence (the noise) for a emission. Only small di(cid:11)erence between average

value of electric current due to the RIS process [ Fig. 3 -(a)] and to resonance excitation

2S (cid:0) 2P [ Fig. 3 -(b) ]. The noise or the emission in temperature range from 450

to 700

C with electric current up to 3(cid:22)A and capacitance up to 20nF with observable

saturation [ Fig. 3 -(c) ]. Values of the electric current varies from 5(cid:22)A up to 30(cid:22)A [ Fig. 3

was measured. The results of the current and capacitance measurements at the temperature

higher than 650

C are the same for both mechanisms. Also it is easy to separate RIS from

o

another ionization using the modulation signal measurements because RIS use the pulse UV

laser.

V. SOME MECHANISMS OF COLLISIONS

If the colliding particles have no charge, the tra jectory r (t ) is assumed to be rectilinear:

r (t ) = (cid:26) + vt , where (cid:26) and v are the impact parameter and relative velocity. The elastic

collisions change the phase of damped oscillator, (cid:30)(t), but not the amplitude, x (t ), due to

the frequency shift (cid:1)! during the phase-perturbing collisions. If the duration of collision,

(cid:28)

, is short compared with the mean time between two consecutive collisions, one can neglect

c

the radiation during collisions and consider the collisions to be instantaneous. Therefore the

collisions are manifested only in phase shifts (Impact broadening approximation), where the

9

dimension parameter h = (cid:26)

N

(cid:28) 1 determines the number of perturbers in the Weisskopf

3

Ar

sphere with the radius (cid:26), where the binary approximation holds. Depending on the type and

states of interacting atoms both attraction and repulsion can take place at long distances.

At short distances the potential is repulsive. In general case the interaction force is depends

not only on spatial but also on angular variables. The results of calculations in which a more

realistic interaction r

is used can not be described by a simple Lorentzian distribution,

(cid:0)6

that depends on the type of the transition. The repulsive part of the interaction is usually

taken into account in the form of Lennard-Jones potential. In general case, when the mean

distance between the atoms is of the same order with the magnitude of atomic dimensions,

simple expression for potential V (r ) = C

=r

is valid with approximations due to both

6

The shift, (cid:1)! = 2(cid:25)(cid:1)(cid:23) , and broadening, (cid:0), of the Lorentz spectral distribution [21] are:

the inelastic collisions between unexcited Ar and Li atoms could not provide the observed

Such value of electron gas density, when DYE laser is applied [ Fig. 3 -(b) ], can be

to the e(cid:11)ects of emission, mainly from the internal hot electrode with a mesh plating by

The one-dimensional systems of driven charges can change symmetry in the phase pulses

space, when the classical phenomena in one direction take into account quantization in

others. It results in thermal drag e(cid:11)ects in solids wires [28], but can result in thermal optical

experiments too. Another e(cid:11)ect is light-induced di(cid:11)usive pulling (pushing) of lithium atoms

into a laser beam, which was studied in Ar noble gas, where the value of di(cid:11)usion coe(cid:14)cient

4.3cm

=s was measured [29].

It should be noted here, that the peak concentration of charged particles produced by

the RIS [ Fig. 3 -(a) ] using 77 ns UV pulses is much more higher than the measured average

value.

means that the Li (cid:0) Ar mixture at temperature in the order of 10

K behaves like a plasma

rather than a neutral gas [6].

By other hand we can discuss another mechanism for observed ionization .

We will take the Doppler cooling as the one step to achieve the low temperature for the

Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) at very low temperature. The limit of the temperature

achieved for Lithium is 140 (cid:22)K by balance with a scattering force in a random direction [30].

The Doppler limit of achievable temperature (T ) is:

k

(cid:1) T =

where (cid:0) is a damping constant.

Let's change this relation:

k

T = (cid:22)h (cid:1)

= (cid:22)h (cid:1) R

can used for a given Li atom the (cid:12)xed value of the Rabi frequency 1000 MHz :rad :. Some

inequalities are for given values in the denominator of the pro(cid:12)le. One of this inequalities

is evidently for an application, because the value of the Rabi frequency (cid:10) = (cid:10)

The well known saturation e(cid:11)ect by intensity of the laser is clearly observed. Is possible to (cid:12)x

at experiment both the frequency (cid:1)! and the laser intensity I . Therefore, the correspondent

(cid:26) must depend on the intensity [ Fig. 4 ] or on the frequency [ Fig. 5]. The simplest calculation

show that the saturation is at (cid:1)! ' 0,02 (cid:10) and absorption begin at (cid:1)! ' (cid:10). As the (cid:0) is

return size of the time, it is possible to transfer a condition of saturation to language of the

time-table interaction [32]. At the (cid:12)xed frequency [ Fig. 4 ], when increase of intensity of

the laser, the saturation comes at the maximal size of (cid:0), that corresponds to the minimal

time. Very important the fact of weak growth is that means that the time too gradually

decreases aspiring to a limit. On the other hand at a weak intensity the time is very large

also grows inde(cid:12)nitely. At the (cid:12)xed size of intensity of the laser [ Fig. 5], the condition of an

exact resonance coincides with a condition when time is equally practically to zero and then

it is gradually increased to inde(cid:12)nitely in process of a distance from a resonance [32]. If now

to put in conformity a parity between frequency (cid:1)! of a (cid:12)eld and k (cid:1) v where is the speed

of atoms, becomes understandable that now it is possible to speak not only about time of

interaction or time of life [32], but also about speeds of atoms, because it is supposed that

is possible to replace one ((cid:1)! ) with another (k (cid:1) v ) accordingly. However, if we can put

((cid:1)! ) as a constant, another v is only one part of the distributions function.

When the condition for the near resonant condition is (cid:1)! (cid:29) (cid:13) for the quantum inter-

ference condition of the EM (cid:12)eld, then the rate R

is simply [31]:

2

R

=

[1 (cid:0) J

(2(cid:26))] ;

(31)

2

0

(cid:0)

2

where J

is a Bessel function. Practically situation is as for one frequency, but with impor-

0

tant features [ Fig. 6] due to a Bessel function.

With relation between k (cid:1) T and the rate R all (cid:12)gures becomes clearly observed due

to connection of the temperature with the atomic velocity. Other atoms have conserved

high velocities. Therefore the inelastic collisions should be expected. The general velocity

distribution can be changed and the satellite distribution can be observed due to laser

induced collisions between atoms.

Abstract

The propensity of molecules to spatially align along the polarization vec-
tor of intense, pulsed light ﬁelds is related to readily-accessible parameters
(molecular polarizabilities, moment of inertia, peak intensity of the light and
its pulse duration). Predictions can now be made of which molecules can
be spatially aligned, and under what circumstances, upon irradiation by in-
tense light. Accounting for both enhanced ionization and hyperpolarizability,
it is shown that all molecules can be aligned, even those with the smallest
static polarizability, when subjected to the shortest available laser pulses (of
suﬃcient intensity).

Studies of the response of matter to very intense ﬂuxes of electromagnetic radiation ad-
dress fundamental physics issues of systems driven strongly away from equilibrium. Matter
is inherently unstable when subjected to strong electric ﬁelds of the type that can be gen-
erated in intense laser light. In the case of molecules subjected to laser light of intensity
in excess of ∼1012 W cm−2, distortions of potential energy surfaces, with concomitant al-
terations in electron density distributions, lead to ionization, dissociation, and formation of
strong dipole moments (µ). With linearly polarized E ﬁelds of magnitudes that equal, or
exceed, interatomic binding ﬁelds, the induced dipole moments exert torques on the molec-
ular axes, µ × E, that can be large enough to spatially reorientate molecules and their ions
such that the most polarizable molecular axis points along the light ﬁeld vector. In early
experiments, anisotropic angular distribution of fragment ions were obtained when the light
polarization vector was rotated relative to the detector axis, and these were taken to be
unambiguous signatures of spatial orientation [1,2]. In recent studies, it has been recognized
that the molecular ionization rate depends on the angle that the internuclear axis makes
with the light ﬁeld vector, and that this also leads to anisotropic angular distributions [3].
Indeed, the ionization rate has to be computed using the ﬁeld ionization Coulomb explosion
model [4], whose angular dependence arises from the fact that the barrier suppression is
given by E · r, where r denotes the molecular axis.

Spatial alignment of isolated molecules is a subset of one of the central endeavors of
physicists and chemists, namely to control the external degrees of freedom of atomic and
molecular species at the microscopic level. The polarizability interaction of an intense,
linearly-polarized light ﬁeld with the induced dipole moment of molecules gives rise to a
double-well potential; the resulting angular reorientation of molecular axes is akin to the
interconversion of left- and right-handed enantiomers that was considered by Hund over 3
decades ago in terms of similar potentials [5]. Spatial alignment of individual molecules
can also justiﬁably be considered a special facet of the optical Kerr eﬀect [6]. On a more
practical level, interest in studies of spatial alignment of molecules has been generated be-
cause of tantalizing possibilities of entirely new studies on pendular-state spectroscopy [7],
coherent control experiments [8], and molecular trapping and focusing [9]. The crucial role
of polarization in choosing or altering dissociation pathways has also been experimentally
established [10]. It is clearly very important, therefore, to establish, both on the basis of the
properties of the molecule under investigation and the characteristics of the laser light that
is used, the extent of spatial alignment that occurs. Speciﬁc insight is also needed on the
relative importance of angle dependent ionization on the one hand and molecular reorienta-
tion on the other in making sense of measured anisotropies in fragment ion distributions. In
this Letter we present results of a comprehensive study that enables predictions to be made
of the propensity of molecules to spatially align in intense, pulsed, polarized light on the
basis of parameters that are readily accessible. We show that existing experimental data,
spanning work done over the past decade by several groups including our own is explained
by our model. We also show that it is possible to align molecules even with extremely short
light pulses irrespective of the polarizability.

In any given analysis of spatial alignment three factors play a crucial role: (i) the peak
intensity of the laser pulse, (ii) its temporal duration, and (iii) the ratio of the molecular
polarizability (ground or excited state) to the moment of inertia (R = α
I ). At high enough
intensities, molecular hyperpolarizabilites may also be signiﬁcant although their role in the

2

alignment dynamics has not hitherto been explicitly considered. It is also well established
that ﬁeld ionization of molecules is ubiquitous with short pulse lasers. The important con-
clusion of the ﬁeld ionization model relevant to alignment is the breakup of the molecule at
a critical distance Rc that is larger than the equilibrium internuclear separation Re [12]. The
stretching of the internuclear axis increases the moment of inertia and leads to a slowing
down of reorientation; dissociation at Rc implies that the molecule will dissociate before the
peak intensity is reached, except for ultrashort light pulses.

The process of alignment is modeled by considering a rotor in a time dependent E
In this case the interaction Hamiltonian is given by HI = -µ.E where µ =

within the laser beam are not taken into account since it has been shown recently that
intensity selective experiments minimize focal volume eﬀects [11]. In Eq. (1), the ﬁrst term
causes reorientation while the second term, the so-called damping term, impedes the motion
of the molecular axis towards the light ﬁeld vector. In the ﬁeld ionization Coulomb explosion
model [4], the damping term arises due to the elongation of the molecular axis from Re to
Rc after the removal of one or two electrons by tunnel/over the barrier ionization.

2τ

We present our results as follows. We ﬁrst consider the simplest case where the polar-
izability is linear and no damping term is present. It is shown that even such a picture is
of wide-ranging validity and utility. We then discuss results of calculations that take into
account both damping and the hyperpolarizability, and we examine the extent to which our
results are modiﬁed. Our calculations are compared with experimental observations.

Eq.

(2) is solved used a 4th-order Runge-Kutta algorithm for a range of light ﬁeld
parameters. We consider the laser intensity range 1012 - 1015 W cm−2, and pulse durations
from 40 fs to 2 ps. In the linear case, molecule-speciﬁc calculations have not been done.
Instead the A-parameter has been taken to lie in the interval 2×104 - 6×107 (covering a wide
range of light and heavy species, amongst them H2, N2, CS2 and I2). The initial direction
of the molecular axis, θ0, is taken to be random in space. After the light pulse is switched
on, the angular position is calculated as a function of time for various values of θ0 as shown
in ﬁgure 1(a). From this one obtains a plot of θf vs. θi where θi is the initial angular
position and θf is the angular orientation of the molecular axis at a particular instant. This
is shown in ﬁgure 1(b). It is easy to show that the angular distribution of the molecular axis
is proportional to ( dθf
. This procedure can no longer be used when the applied ﬁeld is so
dθi
strong that the molecular axis crosses θ=0. In such cases we have used a counting method
by interpolating the relation between θf and θi to obtain the angular distribution.

The trajectories shown in ﬁgure 1 (a) correspond to H2 exposed to 20 fs pulses at 1015
W cm−2. As can be seen from the slope in ﬁgure 1(b) the extent of reorientation in H2
is negligible under these conditions. Similar calculations were carried out for a range of
parameters as speciﬁed above, and results are shown in ﬁgure 2. The surface demarcates
the regions where spatial alignment is signiﬁcant from those where no signiﬁcant reorien-
tation occurs. All points above the surface, i.e. in regions of larger intensity, polarizability
and pulse duration correspond to molecules that are signiﬁcantly aligned, while the oppo-
site holds for points that lie below the surface. Note that we are dealing here only with
linear polarizabilities. The nonlinear polarizability components serve only to strengthen the
alignment. Thus, the demarcation based on α alone is very rigorous.

It is to be noted that the above calculations pertain to the position of the molecular axis.
However alignment is deduced from the anisotropy of fragment ions. To make the connection
with experimental data it should be noted that the angular distributions that are shown are
those that would practically be measured using a spectrometer with a small acceptance
angle. Thus, our calculations are specially relevant to the angular distributions of highly
charged ions (that possess large kinetic energies). This is also important in the context of
the residual angular momentum as the molecule rotates. This is suﬃciently large to cause
signiﬁcant rotation on the time scale of the laser pulse but negligible compared to the energy
of the fragment ions which are typically in excess of 1 eV. Illustrative experimental data for
various molecules are also shown in the ﬁgure and we note the excellent agreement that is
obtained between our model and measured data.

We now consider the damping term.

Ignoring this term essentially assumes that the
molecule is a rigid rotor in the intense ﬁeld. However, as already noted, when the ﬁeld
is suﬃciently large, the ionization dynamics occur through an enhanced ionization (EI)
mechanism wherein one or two electrons are removed at the ﬁrst ionization step. Subsequent
to the ﬁrst ionization step that occurs at the equilibrium internuclear separation, the two
residual atomic ions mutually repel each other, leading to an increase in the bond length.
This results in one or more Stark-shifted electronic levels rising above the potential barrier
that separates the atomic cores, at which point multiple electron ejection occurs, leading
to molecular fragmentation. EI can modify the reorientation rate in two ways. Firstly, as
the moment of inertia increases, the magnitude of the ﬁrst term in Eq. (1) will reduce. In
addition, the damping term will come into play, leading to a further decrease in the rate at
which the molecule rotates towards the light ﬁeld vector. It is important to investigate the
extent EI might modify our ﬁrst-order calculations. Since EI parameters are available only
for a few molecules, we have carried out these calculations for some standard cases. These
can be extended to any other molecule once the relevant parameters are known either by
calculation or experiment.

Fig. 3 (a) shows the angular distribution for H2 for a pulse duration of 40 fs at a peak
laser intensity of 1015 W cm−2, with and without the damping term. It is clear that the
reorientation of H2 is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected when the damping term is included. There
are two major reasons for this. Firstly, R is extremely large and the torque experienced by
H2 is suﬃcient to induce reorientation despite the presence of an opposing force. Secondly,
the fact that the ionization energy (and hence, the appearance intensity) of H2 is quite high,
the damping force only comes into play close to the peak of the laser pulse, by which time
the molecular axis is already aligned with the light polarization vector. Interestingly, the

4

width of the angular distribution with damping included is actually smaller than when no
damping is present. This arises due to the fact that the angular velocity without damping is
larger, causing the molecular axis to execute large amplitude oscillations about θ=0; hence,
there will exist instants at which the peak of the angular distribution will shift away from
zero.

A contrary situation is depicted in Fig. 3(b) when linear CS2 molecules are exposed to
100 fs light ﬁelds. In this case, the lower ionization energy of the molecule coupled with the
relatively small value of A, leads to a situation where there is virtually no reorientation of
the S-C-S axes with the direction of the E ﬁeld at the point at which dissociation occurs.
Strong alignment can be expected if it is assumed that the molecule survives undissociated
till the peak of the laser pulse, a fact contrary to experimental observation, and illustrates
the essentiality of EI in any such model. Similar calculations have been carried out for other
molecules like N2 and I2. The situation for N2 is similar to H2 because of the similarity in
the relevant parameters. In the case of I2, reorientation of the molecule is not signiﬁcant
even without the damping term. Once the damping term is included there is only a small
deﬂection of the molecular axis.

Hitherto, only the polarization response that arises from the linear term has been con-
sidered. To what extent is this justiﬁed, especially at intensities in the range of 1012 - 1015
W cm−2? It is important to note that hyperpolarizabilites are signiﬁcant only at the highest
intensities. This is obvious when we compare the integrals which deﬁne the work done by
the ﬁeld on the molecule by each order of the hyperpolarizability. It can be expected that
for longer pulses, a model based on linear polarizability is suﬃcient since the dissociation of
the molecule occurs on the rising edge of the pulse. However, as the pulse duration becomes
shorter (<50 fs), the molecule will survive till the maximum intensity is reached, and the
reorientation due to the higher order terms will become comparable to that due to the linear
term, and may even exceed it!

To incorporate hyperpolarizability in our calculations, certain approximations need to be
made. Firstly, the magnitude of the second- and higher-order susceptibilities is not known
in most cases [14]. Moreover, these quantities are tensors with numerous components and it
is diﬃcult to consider all the components in an exact way. We consider here the case for H2
taking into account the third order term due to the electronic response γe. The equation of
motion is modiﬁed as follows: αsin2θE 2

→ αsin2θE 2+γesin4θE 4 +. . ..

Fig. 4 shows the eﬀect of nonlinearity on the reorientation of the molecular axis for H2
acted on by a 20 fs pulse.The inclusion of only the third order term [14] leads to a signiﬁcantly
larger reorientation of the H-H axis as compared to the case when only the linear term is
considered. As noted previously, such eﬀects will be signiﬁcant only for very short pulses.
This is shown in ﬁgure 3(a) for the case of a 40 fs pulse wherein the eﬀect of the third order
term is much smaller than that for the 20 fs case. We have veriﬁed that for longer pulses
such higher order terms need no longer be taken into account. Of course, it is obvious that as
the laser pulses get shorter even higher order terms will begin to play a signiﬁcant role. One
can speculate that heavy molecules, like I2, may align with suﬃciently short pulses because
of the contribution from higher order terms. It is clearly necessary to test this conjecture
experimentally since very little is known about the high order polarizabilities of almost all
molecules.

In summary, we have considered molecular reorientation using a classical model. The

5

justiﬁcation for using a classical model is two-fold. In intense ﬁeld-molecule interactions,
classical analysis have been shown to be extremely fruitful in explaining much of the ex-
perimental data. Also, exact time-dependent analysis of the molecular response to a high-
intensity pulsed light ﬁeld is presently not feasible. We show that, despite the obvious
limitations of classical models, the results are considerable utility in understanding a large
body of experimental work on alignment, and for enabling predictions to be made on whether
or not, and under what circumstances, molecules will be spatially aligned when subjected
to intense, polarized, short-duration light ﬁelds. The rigor of the model is demonstrated.
We have also incorporated, for the ﬁrst time, (i) the role of enhanced ionization in the reori-
entation of molecules and (ii) the role of hyperpolarizability. It is shown that higher order
contributions to the dipole moment are very important for extremely short light pulses. It
is predicted that this will lead to alignment of molecules even for sub-50 fs pulses that are
becoming increasingly accessible to experimentalists.

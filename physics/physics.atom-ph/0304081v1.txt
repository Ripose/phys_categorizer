Abstract. – The conditions for occurrence of the Eﬁmov eﬀect is brieﬂy described using
hyperspherical coordinates. The strength of the eﬀective hyperradial ρ−2 potential appearing
for two or three large scattering lengths is computed and discussed as function of two indepen-
dent mass ratios of the three constituent particles. The eﬀect is by far most pronounced for
asymmetric systems with three very diﬀerent masses. One Eﬁmov state may by chance appear
in nuclei. Many states could be present for systems with one electron and two neutral atoms
or molecules. Estimates of the number of states and their sizes and energies are given.

Introduction. – More than 30 years ago Eﬁmov realized that a three-body system could
have a large number of bound states when two or three of the two-body subsystems simultane-
ously have (virtual or bound) s-states suﬃciently close to zero energy [1]. This eﬀect has been
discussed in a number of subsequent publications [2,3,4,5]. External ﬁelds can be used to tune
the eﬀective two-body interaction aiming at approaching the zero energy condition [6, 7, 8].

The picture describing the Eﬁmov eﬀect is that one particle eﬀectively has large-distance
interaction simultaneously with both the other two particles building up a coherent wave
function fully exploiting the interactions. When only one scattering length is large the eﬀect
does not occur since the eﬀective large-distance interactions only involve two of the particles
while the third can avoid contributing by being far away without interacting.

The atomic helium trimer system is usually considered to be the most promising candidate
for naturally occurring Eﬁmov states [9,10]. It has so far escaped direct experimental detection
[11]. Other systems may however be much better candidates possibly with many Eﬁmov
states. The purpose of this letter is to pin-point both the class of best suited candidates and
the crucial properties optimizing the occurrence conditions.

Basic properties. – The hyperspheric adiabatic expansion combined with the Faddeev
decomposition of the wave function has proven very eﬃcient for investigations of weakly
bound and spatially extended three-body systems [3]. Eﬁmov states can then be computed
and without loss of generality even with the simplifying restriction that the potentials act
only on s-waves which are the only contributors at the asymptotic large distances [4].

where mi is the mass, ri the coordinate of particle i
and m is an arbitray normaliza-
tion mass. Thus ρ is a measure of the average size of the system. After solving the eigenvalue
problem for the remaining (angular) coordinates the method provides a hyperradial equation
with mass m and an eﬀective potential U (ρ), which for intermediate distances of ρ has the

the generic form for the Eﬁmov states.

At distances smaller or comparable with the interaction ranges U (ρ) is more complicated
and generally without divergence as ρ−2. This small distance region provides the scale for the
energies of the possible Eﬁmov states and is otherwise completely unimportant for spatially
extended states. At distances larger than the scattering lengths the potential has the form [4]

When all three particles are identical the expression for aav reduces to the common value of

The Eﬁmov states are found at intermediate distances as solutions corresponding to the
potential U (ρ) in eq.(2). The wave function is Kiξ(κρ), where K is the modiﬁed Bessel
function with an imaginary index and the binding energy is B = ¯h2κ2/(2m). By expansion
of K for small and large values of ρ the radial wave function fn is [9]

where the zero point for the ﬁrst oscillation in ρ is assumed to be Re, which in analogy to

for all bound states for distances κρ larger than 1, where the eﬀective radial potential falls oﬀ

Strength of the potential. – The all decisive parameter ξ must now be determined for
systems where Eﬁmov states may occur. At least two of the three scattering lengths must be
large. The formal analysis in [4] leads to trancendental equations for ξ. For identical bosons
we obtain the usual Eﬁmov equation rewritten with real quantities, i.e.

8 sinh(ξπ/6) = ξ√3 cosh(ξπ/2)

with the solution ξ

1.0063. The result is independent of the mass of the particles.

For non-identical bosons, still when all three scattering lengths are large, we ﬁnd instead

In general the solution ξ then depends on two ratios of masses, e.g. m2/m1 and m3/m1.
When all masses are equal (ϕk = π/3, fi = F = 2 sinh(ξπ/6)/√3) eq. (11) reduces to three
simpler equations

where the solution now only depends on the angle ϕk varying between 0 and π/2. Still ϕk in
eq. (13) in turn depends on the above two mass ratios.

The conclusion is that the strength of the potential has to be found by solving eq. (11)
when all scattering lengths are large and eq. (15) when only two scattering lengths are large.
The Eﬁmov eﬀect does not occur when only one scattering length is large. Eq. (10) is the
limit of eq. (11) when all masses are equal. The parameters are the three angles ϕk, which
through eq. (13) are functions of two independent mass ratios.

Fig. 1 – 3d plot of the strength parameter ξ, obtained from eq. (11) when all three subsystems
contribute, as function of the two mass ratios m2/m1 and m3/m1.

We show in ﬁg. 1 the 3d plot of ξ as function of these independent parameters. The
smallest values slightly above 1 are found in a valley passing the symmetric point of three
equal masses and extending towards one very large mass and one moderate mass ratio around
unity. This case with two light masses and one heavy mass corresponds to the smallest ξ
where the Eﬁmov eﬀect is least pronounced.

On the other hand large values of ξ extending to inﬁnity are obtained for two heavy and
m3,
one light mass. This is seen in ﬁg. 1 when both coordinates are large (m1 ≪
m3 and
m3), and along both axes when the other coordinate is very small (m2 ≪
m2 ∼
m2). Thus moderate values of ξ arise for symmetric systems while exceedingly
m1 ≪
m3 ≪
large strengths are possible for asymmetric systems. In all cases the assumption is that all
three two-body subsystems simultaneously have an s-state close to the threshold of binding.
This is most likely for a symmetric system of identical bosons where only one interaction is
involved.

m2, m1 ≪
m1 ≪

For non-indentical particles two tuned subsystems is the least demanding to exhibit the
Eﬁmov eﬀect. If furthermore two of the clusters are identical particles only one independent
requirement of an s-state close to zero is left. In this case where only two subsystems contribute
(two large scattering lengths) the strength ξ is found from eq. (15) as function of the angle ϕk
corresponding to the subsystem with the small third scattering length. The result displayed
0 and the linear convergence to zero as
in ﬁg. 2 show the divergence as 1/ϕk for ϕk →
4(π/2
π/2. When all masses are equal ϕk = π/3 and eq. (15) reduces
to eq. (10) with the left hand side divided by two. The resulting solution ξ = 0.499 is roughly
two times smaller than 1.0063 obtained when all three subsystems contribute.

The angle ϕk is a function of two mass ratios. When mk is much smaller than both the
other masses ϕk approaches zero and ξ is very large. When mk is much larger than at least
one of the other masses ϕk approaches π/2 and ξ is very small. Thus extremely large ξ is only
possible for two contributing subsystems when the particle k related to both these subsystems
has a comparatively small mass. The Eﬁmov eﬀect occurs in all cases but is only pronounced
for large ξ.

In ﬁg. 3 we show solutions to eq. (11) corresponding to three very large scattering lengths
for a series of diﬀerent mass ratios. The striking features are as described in connection

with ﬁg. 1 that ξ is very small for one heavy and two light particles, relatively small for
similar masses and huge for one light and two heavy particles. Comparing ﬁgs. 2 and 3 we
conclude that the mass ratios determine the order of magnitude of the strength ξ whereas the
contribution from the third subsystem is marginal.

Possible examples. – Large values of ξ favor occurrence of (many) Eﬁmov states, see
eq. (8). It should be emphasized that at least two scattering lengths must be suﬃciently large
to allow the eﬀect in the ﬁrst place. An interaction in one two-body subsystem of longer
range than the generic ρ−2 potential prohibits occurrence. For nuclei this leaves only two
neutrons combined with a charged ordinary nucleus [5]. There might be a chance to produce
one Eﬁmov state but the second would not appear as illustrated by 11Li (9Li+n + n) where
1018.
0.074 according to eq. (9) corresponds to an increase of the radius by a factor of 3
ξ
In atomic and molecular physics the possibilities are much better. For identical particles
ξ is mass independent. The molecular prototype is the atomic helium trimer 4He3 with an
excited Eﬁmov state of binding energy 0.18 µeV and radius about 50 ˚A. Correspondingly
ξ
1.0063 and the radius increase between neighboring Eﬁmov states is a factor of 22. Equal
masses and only two contributing subsystems change this factor to about 542 implying that the
radius of the second Eﬁmov state then would exceed 1 µm. By far the most favorable case is
one light and two heavy identical particles. One small step in this direction is the asymmetric
helium trimer 3He4He2 with one bound (pronounced halo) state of binding around 1 µeV and
radius about 13 ˚A [9, 12].

Substituting one helium atom by an alkali atom reduces the two-body binding energy
[13] and produce spatially extended three-body systems like 7Li4He3He and 23Na3He2 with
0.255, 0.085 [12]. In 6Li4He3He we anticipate an Eﬁmov state with a size larger than the
ξ
50 ˚A expected in 4He3. Other combinations with one helium and two alkali atoms are easily
conjectured from the results in [13]. For example 3He23Na2 and 3He133Cs2 give ξ
1.22, 2.75
implying that the second Eﬁmov state only is 13, 3.1 times larger than the ﬁrst.

Another type of combinations are even more favorable. One charge is allowed, since
the destructive Coulomb-like long-range interaction still is not present. One electron and

two identical atoms (or molecules) then maximize the ξ-value. It is suﬃcient with a large
scattering length for the two electron-atom (molecule) systems and if also the atom-atom
(molecule-molecule) contributes the eﬀect could be even larger. Then ξ could be as large as
10−5) and the radius increase per state from
100 (electron-atom (or molecule) mass ratio
≤
eq. (9) could be less than 5 %. The number of Eﬁmov states within practical reach would
increase dramatically while they still remain relatively stable [14].

However, this scenario requires a large electron-atom scattering length or equivalently an
s-state energy very close to zero. Since the scattering length a at least should be larger than
5-10 ˚A the electron binding ¯h2/(2mea2) should at least be smaller than 0.1 eV. This is an
established fact for the bound negative ions Ca, Ti and Sr and furthermore a number of atoms
(He, Be, N, Ne, Mg, Ar, Mn, Zn, Kr, Cd, Xe, Hg, Rn) cannot bind an electron although the
distance from the threshold in general is unknown [15].

The three-body system should now consist of the electron plus a pair of the above atoms
chosen as close as possible to the threshold of s-state binding. Here 4He+e+4He is the
obvious combination but unbound with respect to 4He2 leaving the possible Eﬁmov states as
excited states with a large decay probability. Substituting 6Li for one of the helium atoms
reduces the atomic binding and 4He+e+6Li is then a promising candidate. Other examples
like Mg+e+Mg, Mg+e+Ne, Mg+e+Ar, Mg+e+Kr and Mg+e+Xe were investigated in [16].
Adding an electron to the weakly bound two-body systems Ar-Ar, Cd-Cd, Cl-Xe, Cs-Hg,
He-Hg, Hg-Hg [17], also present Eﬁmov candidates, but pairs like H-H, Ca-Ca, Li-Li, Na-Na
could be more suitable.

Instead of atoms we could try to use molecules with very small electron binding, combining
them pairwise and adding an electron, see [17,18] for candidates. If this should create Eﬁmov
states the internal structure of the molecules is not allowed to change within the pair. This
might be possible but requires a separate investigation.

The Eﬁmov conditions of two zero energy subsystems can be fulﬁlled without lower lying
bound two-body states, but it is much more probable to encounter systems where the state

A.S. Jensen and D.V. Fedorov: Efimov states in asymmetric systems

of zero energy is an excited two-body state. The resulting Eﬁmov states are clearly more
unstable and their structure more diﬃcult to study directly. However, signals should show
up in scattering experiments [19, 20]. The properties of the Eﬁmov states are in any case
determined by the scattering lengths and the size of ξ as discussed above.

Conclusion. – The strength of the attraction in the eﬀective hyperradial ρ−2 potential
for three particles is for large scattering lengths determined by simple equations depending
only on two independent mass ratios. We survey this mass dependence and provide informa-
tion about favorable mass combinations. The larger the strength the more pronounced is the
Eﬁmov eﬀect. The density of Eﬁmov states increases with the square root of the strength
which for existing mass combinations can vary by several orders of magnitude. Two con-
tributing subsystems for one light and two heavy particles is much more favorable than three
contributing subsystems with similar masses. Careful choices of the three particles can then
simultaneously optimize the Eﬁmov conditions of large strength and large scattering lengths.
This may allow detection of several or many members in a series of Eﬁmov states or alter-
natively allow detection of the ﬁrst Eﬁmov state in cases when the conditions are less well
fulﬁlled. We suggest a number of possible combinations of an electron and two neutral atoms
or molecules, or alternatively one light atom and two heavy atoms or molecules.

Abstract

We present here cross section results for ionization of hydrogen atoms by electron
impact at 1eV, 0.5eV and 0.3eV energy above threshold, calculated in hyperspher-
ical partial wave theory. The results are in excellent agreement with the available
semiclassical results of Crothers et al [ 2002 ] for these energies. Considering its
success above 1eV energy [ Das et al (2003) ] for various kinematic conditions,
and considering the present success some advantages of the hyperspherical partial
wave theory over other sophisticated theories, requiring large scale computations,
are clearly demonstrated.

Introduction

Over the last couple of years considerable progress has been made in the study of
ionization of hydrogen atoms by electron impact, apparently the simplest three body
coulomb problem in quamtum scattering theory at low energies. Still full understanding
of this problem, particularly near threshold, has not been achieved. For equal-energy-
sharing kinematics McCurdy and co-workers made a break-through calculation in their
exterior complex scaling (ECS) approach [Rescigno et al(1999)]. Their results for 30eV,
25eV, 19.6eV and 17.6eV, surprisingly agree, particularly qualitatively, with the mea-
sured results of R¨oder et al[1997,2002]. But below 2eV, results of ECS theory are not
yet available. ECS approach needs huge computational resources and special numer-
ical techniques. Below 2eV energy ECS approach may need far more computational
resources. Another sophisticated approach is the convergent close-coupling (CCC) the-
ory of Bray and associates [1994], which works so beautifully for other atomic scattering
problems, reproduces ionization cross section results satisfactorily only above 2eV excess
energy. For 2eV excess energy their results diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the absolute mea-
sured values [ R¨oder et al(1997) ]. Below 2eV excess energy CCC results are also not
available. Recent calculations of Das and co-workers, in the hyperspherical partial wave
theory (HSPW), for equal-energy-sharing kinematics, when the two outgoing electrons
have equal energies, also works nicely [ Das et al 2003 ]. So far hyperspherical partial
wave theory has not been tested below 2eV excess energy. Very recently semiclassical
calculations of Crothers and co-workers has been reported [ 2002 ], which gives very good
cross section results for low energies, say 4eV and 2eV excess energies. Their results for
1eV, 0.5eV and 0.3eV excess energies are also available. This calculation encouraged us
to test whether the hyperspherical partial wave theory works for excess energy below
2eV. Here we made such a test for excess energy of 1eV, 0.5eV and 0.3eV. We ﬁnd sur-
prisingly that the HSPW theory really gives excellent cross section results in very good
agreement with the semi classical calculation of Crothers et al[ 2002 ] for the above very
low energies. Here we only need to increase the asymptotic range parameter R∞ to suﬃ-
ciently large values of several thousands of a.u. for these energies, possibly not thinkable
in ECS calculations.
It may be noted here that in the hyperspherical R-matrix with
semiclassical outgoing waves( HRM-SOW ) calculations of Selles et al[ 2002 ] for double
for converged
photo-ionization of Helium also needed values of R∞ thousands of a.u.
results.

II. Hyperspherical Partial Wave Theory

Hyperspherical partial wave theory has been described in details in [ Das 1998, Das
et al 2003 ] and brieﬂy in [ Das 2001 and Das 2002 ]. In this approach we determine

where Φi is the initial state wave function, Vi is the interaction potential in this channel
and Ψ(−)
is the exact two-electron continuum wave function with incoming boundary
conditions, in presence of the nucleus, which is considered inﬁnitely heavy and sitting
at the origin. The scattering state Ψ(−)
is determined by expanding it in terms of
symmetrized hyperspherical harmonics [ Das 1998, Lin 1974 ] which are functions of
ﬁve angular variables. The hyper radius and the angular variables are deﬁned by R =
√r1
2, α = atan(r2/r1), ˆr1 = (θ1, φ1), ˆr2 = (θ2, φ2) and ω = (α, ˆr1, ˆr2) and set
2, α0 = atan(p2/p1), ˆp1 = (θp1, φp1), ˆp2 = (θp2, φp2) and ω0 = (α0, ˆp1, ˆp2),

These equations are truncated to N = Nmx, the number of channels retained in the
calculation for each ﬁxed µ. The Nmx number of independent solutions of the truncated
equations, have to be determined over the interval (0,
). This equations may be solved
in diﬀerent alternative approaches [ Das 2001, 2002, Das et al 2003 ]. The most eﬀective
approach turns out to be the one in which the interval (0,
) is divided into three
subintervals ( 0, ∆ ), ( ∆, R∞ ) and ( R∞,
), where ∆ is of few atomic units and
R∞ is some point in the far asymptotic domain. One may construct Nmx independent
solutions of equations ( 2 ) over ( 0, ∆ ) by solving these as a two-points boundary
value problem, the k-th solution vector is made to vanish at the origin and take the
Nmx unit matrix as its value at ∆. These solutions are then
k-th column of the Nmx
continued over ( ∆, R∞ ) by solving these equations by the Taylor’s expansion method
with frequent stabilization. Beyond R∞ the solution may be obtained from expansion
in inverse powers of R with suitable sine and cosine factors [ Das 1998, Das et al 2003 ].
Then the asymptotic incoming boundary conditions completely deﬁne [ Das 1998, Das
et al 2003 ] the scattering-states wave function Ψ(−)
f s . For the initial interval ( 0, ∆ )
solution by the diﬀerence method proves most eﬀective. In our earlier calculation [ Das
et al 2003 ], at higher energies we used a ﬁve-point diﬀerence scheme. This gives us very
good cross sections for 30eV, 25eV, 19.6eV and 17.6eV for varied kinematic conditions.
In our present calculation we propose to use larger mesh size ( double of our previous
calculation ). So in place of a ﬁve-point diﬀerence scheme we use a seven-point diﬀerence
scheme as described below.

In the seven-point scheme we divide the interval [0, ∆] into m subintervals by using
mesh points R0, R1, R2, ......., Rm−1, Rm where Rk = hk , k = 0, 1, 2, . . . . , m and h
= ∆/m.

In this scheme we use the following formulae

The quantities on the right hand sides within curly brackets represent the error terms.
The corresponding diﬀerence equations are obtained by substituting these expressions
the values of second order derivatives from the diﬀerential equation (12). For continuing
these solutions in the domain (∆, R∞) we need ﬁrst order derivatives f ′
N (R) at ∆.
These are computed from the diﬀerence formula

Here too, the quantity within curly brackets represents the error term. The solutions
thus obtained in (0, ∆) are then continued over (∆, R∞) by Taylor’s expansion method,
as stated earlier, with stabilization after suitable steps [ Choi and Tang 1975 ].

III. Results

for 1eV, 2000 a.u.

for 0.5eV and 3000 a.u.

In our present calculation for the equal-energy-sharing kinematics for 1eV, 0.5eV and
0.3eV excess energies, we have included 30 channels and have chosen ∆ = 5 a.u. ( as
in our previous calculation [ Das et al 2003 ] for higher energies ). Small variation of
the value of ∆ about the value chosen does not change the results. Here we need to
chose R∞ of about 1000 a.u.
for 0.3eV
for smooth convergence of the asymptotic series solution and for smooth ﬁtting with the
asymptotic solution [ Das et al 2003 ] for equal-energy-sharing cases. For unequal-energy-
sharing cases one has to move to still larger distances. For going to the far asymptotic
domain a larger value of h (grid spacing) is preferable. Here we have chosen h = 0.1
a.u. up to ∆ and a value 0.2 a.u. beyond ∆ in all the cases. Accordingly a seven point
scheme, as described above, is more suitable over a ﬁve point scheme used in our earlier
calculation [ Das et al 2003]. So we have chosen the above seven-point scheme in the
present calculation. In our present calculations we included states with L up to 5. Values
of L above 5 give insigniﬁcant contributions. The (l1, l2) pairs which have been included
in our calculation are more or less suﬃcient for near convergence as is evident from the
results of calculations with the inclusion of larger number of channels. Computation with
all these have been easily carried out on a 2 CPU SUN Enterprise 450 system with 512
MB RAM ( However the calculation could not be done on a Pentium-III PC ).

For each incident energy three sets of results have been presented for the two outgoing
electrons having equal energies. These are constant - Θab geometry results, Θa-constant
geometry results and the results for symmetric geometry. For 1eV excess energy we have
presented these results in ﬁgures 1(a),1(b) and 1(c) respectively. The corresponding re-
sults for energy 0.5eV are presented in ﬁgures 2(a),2(b) and 2(c) respectively. The results
for 0.3eV have been presented in ﬁgures 3(a),3(b) and 3(c) respectively. Here we compare
our results with the very recent semiclassical calculation of Crothers et al [ 2002 ] for
Θab = 180o and 150o in ﬁgures 1(a),2(a) and 3(a). For other geometries, unfortunately,
neither experimental nor any theoretical results are available for comparison. In any case
the close agreement between our results and those of Deb and Crothers for Θab = 180o
and Θab = 150o is highly encouraging and the results are likely to be very good. A little
steeper rise of our results compared to those of Deb and Crothers at 0o are in conformity
with the general tends of our corresponding earlier results [ Das et al 2003 ] for 2eV
and 4eV excess energies. Our results for Θab = 120o and 100o also appear good. Unfor-
tunately there are no experimental results for veriﬁcation. The results for Θa-constant
geometry and those of symmetric geometry are also in very nice agreement in shapes,
150o, with those for 2eV and 4eV excess energy
particularly for Θa =
cases (see Das et al [ 2003]). The absolute experimental results for these geometries at
2eV and 4eV excess energies also suggest that our present results are likely to be accurate.

IV. Conclusions

From the results presented above it may be claimed that the hyperspherical partial
wave theory works at 1eV,0.5eV and 0.3eV excess energies also. We have already good
results [ Das et al 2003 ] for energies up to 30eV for various kinematic conditions. In-
clusion of states with angular momentum, say up to 15, give correct cross sections at
higher energies, say 54.4eV or 60eV (such calculations are now in progress). For extreme
unequal-energy-sharing cases, calculations with larger values of R∞, compared to those
for equal-energy-sharing cases are likely to give dependable results for such kinematical
conditions also. Another point to note is that in this approach exploration of far asymp-
totic domain is possible by increasing R∞ to thousands of atomic units, which is possibly
not thinkable for ECS or similar other calculations. All these suggest that the hyper-
spherical partial wave theory has some advantages over existing other very sophisticated
calculations requiring large scale computations. We expect that experimental results at
1eV,0.5eV and 0.3eV excess energies will give further support to our claim.

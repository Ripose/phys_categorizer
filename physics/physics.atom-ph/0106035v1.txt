Abstract

We show that a dense spectrum of chaotic multiply-excited eigenstates can
play a major role in collision processes involving many-electron multicharged
ions. A statistical theory based on chaotic properties of the eigenstates enables
one to obtain relevant energy-averaged cross sections in terms of sums over
single-electron orbitals. Our calculation of the low-energy electron recombi-
nation of Au25+ shows that the resonant process is 200 times more intense
than direct radiative recombination, which explains the recent experimental
results of Hoﬀknecht et al. [J. Phys. B 31, 2415 (1998)].

In this paper we give a quantitative explanation of the puzzle of electron recombination
with Au25+. We also demonstrate how to calculate the contribution of “chaotic” multiply-
excited states of the compound ion, which mediate electron recombination with complex
many-electron ions.

Experimentally, this process was studied recently at the UNILAC heavy ion accelerator
facility of the GSI in Darmstadt [1]. In spite of a high energy resolution [2] the measured
recombination rate did not reveal any resonances and only showed two broad structures
around 30 and 80 eV. However, its magnitude at low electron energies ε
1 eV exceeded
the radiative recombination (RR) rate by a factor of 150 [3], although the observed energy
dependence was close to to that of RR.

∼

It is well-known that recombination rate can be enhanced by dielectronic recombina-
tion (DR). In this process the incident electron is captured in a doubly-excited state of the
compound ion, which is then stabilised by photoemission. Suggested originally by J. Say-
ers, it was ﬁrst considered by Massey and Bates [4] in the problem of ionospheric oxygen.
Later DR was found to be important for the ionization balance in the solar corona and
high-temperature plasmas on the whole [5]. Electron-ion recombination has been measured
directly in the laboratory since early 1980’s [6]. More recently the use of heavy-ion accel-
erators and electron coolers of ion storage rings has greatly advanced the experiment [7,8].
Recombination rates for many ions have been measured from threshold to hundreds of eV
electron energies with a fraction-of-eV resolution [9–15]. For few-electron ions the measured
rates were in good agreement with theory which added the contribution of DR resonances
to the RR background, e.g., He+ [16], Li-like C4+ [15] and Ar15+ [9,14], and B-like Ar13+
[17]. However, more complicated ions, e.g., Au51+ [13] and U28+ [12], showed complicated
resonance spectra and strongly-enhanced recombination rates at low electron energies. In
particular, in U28+ the theory was able to explain the main resonant features in the range
80–180 eV, but failed to identify the resonances and reproduce the rate at smaller energies
[18]. The situation in Au25+ [1] looks even more puzzling.

In Ref. [19] we suggested that electron recombination with Au25+ is mediated by complex
multiply-excited states of Au24+, rather than “simple” dielectronic resonances. Electrons
could be captured in these states due to a strong conﬁguration interaction in this open-shell
system (the ground state of Au24+ is 4f 9). The single-particle spectrum of Au24+ does not
have large gaps, see Fig. 1. Using the single-particle orbitals we generated many-electron
conﬁgurations, evaluated their energies and estimated the energy density of multiply-excited
states [19]. Owing to the “gapless” single-particle spectrum, the density increases rapidly
as a function of energy, as described by the Fermi-gas-model ansatz [20]

ρ(E) = AE−ν exp(a√E),

(1)

with A = 31.6, ν = 1.56, a = 3.35 a.u. [21], where E is the energy above the ground state
in atomic units used throughout the paper.

The excited states are characterised by their total angular momentum and parity J π,
and are 2J + 1 times degenerate. Therefore the total level density is a sum of partial level
J π(2J + 1)ρJ π(E). The spectrum of Au24+ near the ionization threshold,

we can estimate the partial densities by ρJ π = f (J)ρ/

over f (J). For the most abundant J values this leads to ρJ π(E) = AJ πE−ν exp(a√E) with
104 au, which means that the
AJ π
spacing between the multiply-excited states with a given J π is very small: D = 1/ρJ π

meV. This would explain why autoionising resonances could not be observed in electron
recombination with Au25+ [19]. However, the large density is only a “kinematic” reason
behind the experimental ﬁnding, because we have not proved that the electron can actually
be captured in the multiply excited states.
In what follows we analyse the dynamics of
electron capture and show that the Coulomb interaction between the electrons makes the
capture eﬃcient and accounts for the observed enhanced recombination rate.

Taking into account this interaction is the key problem in many-electron processes. In
general, this can be achieved by constructing a basis of many-electron states Φk from single-
particle orbitals, and solving the eigenproblem for the Hamiltonian matrix Hik =
,
Φki
h
which yields the eigenvalues Eν and eigenstates
of the system (conﬁg-
uration interaction method). For open-shell systems with a few valence electrons, e.g.,
rare-earth atoms, this becomes an increasingly diﬃcult task. The density of states grows
very rapidly with the excitation energy, and ﬁnding the eigenstates requires diagonalisation
of ever greater matrices.

On the other hand, when the level density is high and the two-body interaction is suf-
ﬁciently strong the system is driven into a regime of many-body quantum chaos, where the
eﬀect of conﬁguration mixing can be described statistically. In this case each eigenstate con-
tains a large number N of principal components C (ν)

states Φk which are strongly mixed together. This strong mixing takes place in a certain

This picture of many-body quantum chaos is supported by numerical studies of nuclei

spreading width in Au24+: Γspr ≈
0.5 a.u. Hence, a typical eigenstate near the ionization
threshold contains N

Unlike complex multiply-excited states Ψν, the initial state of the recombination process

introduced on the right-hand side of Eq. (10). Steps similar to those that lead to Eq. (10)
were used to obtain mean-squared matrix elements of operators between chaotic many-body
states [25,29].

Chaotic nature of the multiply-excited states Ψν can also be employed to estimate their
radiative widths Γ(r)
ν . Electron-photon interaction is described by a single-particle dipole
operator ˆd. Any excited electron in Ψν may emit a photon, thus leading to radiative stabil-
isation of this state. The total photoemission rate Γ(r)

iν is the mean occupation number factor. Since Ψν have large numbers of principal

components N, their radiative widths display small 1/√N ﬂuctuations. This can also be
seen if one recalls that a chaotic multiply-excited state is coupled by photoemission to many
lower-lying states, and the total radiative width is the sum of a large number of (strongly
ﬂuctuating) partial widths. A similar eﬀect is known in compound nucleus resonances in
low-energy neutron scattering [20].

It is important to compare the radiative and autoionisation widths of chaotic multiply-
excited states. Equation (12) shows that Γ(r) is comparable to the single-particle radiative
widths. On the other hand, the autoionisation width Γ(r), Eq. (8), is suppressed by a factor
C (ν)
N −1 relative to that of a typical dielectronic resonance. A comparison of Eqs.

(6) and (9) also shows that Γ(a) is suppressed as D/Γspr. Therefore, in systems with dense
spectra of chaotic multiply-excited states the autoionisation widths are small. Physically
this happens because the coupling strength of a two-electron doorway state is shared between
many complex eigenstates. As a result, the radiative width may dominate in the total width
of the resonances, Γ(r)
Γ(a), making their ﬂuorescence yield close to unity. Our numerical
results for the recombination of Au25+ presented below, conﬁrm this scenario.

quantum number of the lowest unoccupied ionic orbital. Note that the direct and resonant
recombination cross sections of Eqs. (13) and (5) have similar energy dependences. There-
fore, for the purpose of comparing with experiment we can evaluate the cross sections at one
low energy, say ε = 0.5 eV. This energy is much greater than the thermal energy spread of
the electron beam [2] and the cross sections can be compared directly to the experiment [1].

In summary, we have shown that a dense spectrum of chaotic multiply-excited states can
play a major role in the dynamics of electron recombination with many-electron multicharged
ions, and possibly other processes, e.g. charge transfer in collisions of multiply-charged ions
with neutral atoms. Based on the chaotic nature of these states, we have developed a
statistical theory which enables one to calculate energy-averaged cross sections for processes
which go via such resonances. Applied to the recombination of Au25+, the theory shows
that the contribution of resonances exceeds that of direct radiative recombination 200 times,
which explains the recent experimental ﬁndings [1].

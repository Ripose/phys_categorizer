Eﬀects of conﬁnement on permanent electric-dipole moment of Xe atoms in liquid Xe

(Dated: December 23, 2013)

Searches for permanent electric-dipole moments (EDM) of atoms provide important constraints on
competing extensions to the standard model of elementary particles. Recently proposed experiment
with liquid 129Xe [M.V. Romalis and M.P. Ledbetter, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 067601 (2001)] may
signiﬁcantly improve present limits on the EDMs. To interpret experimental data in terms of
CP-violating sources, one must relate measured atomic EDM to various model interactions via
electronic-structure calculations. Here we study density dependence of atomic EDMs. The analysis
is carried out in the framework of the cell model of the liquid coupled with relativistic atomic-
structure calculations. We ﬁnd that compared to an isolated atom, the EDM of an atom of liquid
Xe is suppressed by about 40%.

PACS numbers: 11.30.Er,32.10.Dk,61.20.Ja,31.30.Jv

Most extensions of the standard model of elementary
particles, e.g., supersymmetry, naturally produce per-
manent electric dipole moments (EDM) of atoms and
molecules [1] that are comparable to or larger than
present limits (see, e.g., a popular review [2]). For
example, the most accurate to date determination of
atomic EDM of 199Hg [3] sets limits on a number of im-
portant parameters: CP-violating QCD vacuum angle,
quark chromo-EDMs, semileptonic CP-violating param-
eters, and restricts parameter space for certain extensions
to the standard model. A substantial, several orders of
magnitude improvement in sensitivity to all the enumer-
ated sources of CP-violation is anticipated in an exper-
iment proposed by Romalis and Ledbetter [4]. These
authors propose to search for an EDM of a liquid sample
of 129Xe. Compared to the gas-phase experiment [5], a
drastically improved sensitivity of the liquid Xe experi-
ment is mainly due to the higher number densities of the
liquid phase (1022 atoms/cm3).

The very use of the liquid phase raises questions about
density-dependent factors which can inﬂuence the out-
come and interpretation of the experiment. For exam-
ple, an EDM experiment with a molecular liquid was
proposed in Ref.
[6]. The authors found an additional
suppression of the EDM signal by a factor of a hundred
due to a reduced population of molecular rotational levels
in liquid. Although the experiment with liquid Xe will be
free from such an eﬀect, it is clear that the eﬀects of the
liquid phase on atomic EDMs have to be investigated.

An EDM of an atom is related to a strength of a CP-
violating source via electronic-structure (enhancement or
shielding) factors. For an isolated Xe atom such factors
were computed previously: P,T-odd semileptonic inter-
actions were considered by M˚artensson-Pendrill [7] and
nuclear Schiﬀ moment — by Dzuba et al. [8]. Here we
employ a simple cell model to study density dependence
of the electronic-structure factors. Technically, we ex-
tend the previous atomic relativistic many-body calcula-
tions by conﬁning a Xe atom to a spherically-symmetric
cavity. In a non-polar liquid such as liquid Xe, this cav-
ity roughly approximates an averaged interaction with

the neighboring atoms. Imposing proper boundary con-
ditions at the cavity radius, ﬁrst we solve the Dirac-
Hartree-Fock (DHF) equations and then employ the rela-
tivistic random-phase approximation (RRPA) to account
for correlations. To the best of our knowledge, here we
report the ﬁrst ab initio relativistic calculations of prop-
erties of a liquid. We ﬁnd that compared to the EDM of
an isolated atom, the resulting EDM of an atom of liquid
Xe is suppressed by about 40%. Thus if the experiment
with liquid Xe is carried out with the anticipated sensi-
tivity, we expect that the inferred constraints on possible
sources of CP-violation would be indeed several orders of
magnitude better than the present limits.

Sources of atomic EDM — The conventional atomic
Hamiltonian H0 among other symmetries is invariant
with respect to space-reﬂection (P) and time reversal
(T). Therefore, on very general grounds, an expectation

Now we specify particular forms of HCP . An anal-
ysis [1] shows that for diamagnetic atoms, such as Xe,
the EDM predominantly arises due to P,T-odd semi-
leptonic interaction HTN between electrons and nucle-
ons and also due to interaction HSM of electrons with
the so-called nuclear Schiﬀ moment [9]. Smaller atomic
EDM is generated by intrinsic EDM of electrons and

Here subscripts e and N distinguish between operators
acting in the space of electronic and nuclear coordinates
respectively. CTN is a coupling constant to be determined
from an interpretation of EDM measurements and to be
compared with theoretical model-dependent predictions.
Due to averaging over nuclear degrees of freedom, this in-
teraction depends on nuclear density distribution ρN (r).

Cell model of liquid xenon — Here we employ a simple
cell model (see [11] and references therein) to estimate
the eﬀects of the environment on permanent EDM of a
given atom. According to the cell model, we conﬁne an
atom to a spherical cavity of radius

Rcav =

In non-relativistic calculations periodicity requires that
the normal component of the gradient of electronic wave-
function vanishes at the surface of the cell (see, e.g., [13])

(Rcav) = 0 .

Before proceeding with a technical question of imple-
menting these boundary conditions in relativistic calcu-
lations, we notice that the cell model implicitly incor-
porates an average polarization interaction with the me-
dia. Indeed, the Hamiltonian of an atom placed in the
liquid in addition to the conventional atomic Hamilto-
nian H0 includes interaction of electrons with the rest of

2

the atoms in the media. This interaction is dominated
by polarization potential. An important point is that
the averaged polarization interaction can be expressed as
Vp =
cav, where ǫ is the dielectric con-
stant of the media [13]. This interaction does not depend
on electronic coordinate — it is just an additive constant
which does not aﬀect calculations of EDM. Thus we may
approximate the total Hamiltonian with the traditional
atomic Hamiltonian H0.

−

Further, the spherical symmetry of the cell allows us
to employ traditional methods of atomic structure. The
only modiﬁcation is due to boundary conditions (6).
However, in relativistic calculations, a special care should
be taken when implementing this boundary condition.
Indeed, the Dirac bi-spinor may be represented as

ϕnκm(r) =

where P and Q are the large and small radial components
respectively and Ω is the spherical spinor. The angular
quantum number κ = (l
j) (2j + 1). The nonrelativis-
tic boundary condition (6) applied directly to the above
ansatz would lead to two separate constraints on P and
Q. This over-speciﬁes boundary conditions and leads to
the Klein paradox.

A possible relativistic generalization of the boundary

condition (6) is

(8)

Since in the non-relativistic limit the small component
Q vanishes, this generalization subsumes Eq. (6). Due
to a semi-qualitative nature of our calculations, here we
have chosen to use simpler (MIT bag model) boundary
condition

Pnκ(Rcav) = Qnκ(Rcav) .

(9)

Non-relativistically it corresponds to impenetrable cav-
ity surface. Compared to this condition, the periodic
boundary conditions (8) are “softer”, i.e., they modify
the free-atom wavefunctions less signiﬁcantly; we expect
that our use of Eq. (9) would somewhat overestimate the
eﬀects of conﬁnement in the liquid.

Atom in a cavity: DHF and RRPA solutions — To re-
iterate the discussion so far, within the cell model, the
complex liquid-structure problem is reduced to solving
atomic many-body Dirac equation with boundary condi-
tions (9). The atomic-structure analysis is simpliﬁed by
the fact that Xe is a closed-shell atom. Below we self-
consistently solve the DHF equations inside the cavity.
Then we employ more sophisticated RRPA.

At the DHF level, the atomic wavefunction is repre-
sented by the Slater determinant composed of occupied
(core) orbitals ϕa. These orbitals are determined from a
set of DHF equations

c(α
(cid:0)

·

p) + βc2 + Vnuc + VDHF

ϕa = εaϕa ,

(10)

(cid:1)

where Vnuc is a potential of the Coulomb interaction with
a ﬁnite-size nucleus of charge density ρN (r) and VDHF is
non-local self-consistent DHF potential. The DHF poten-
tial depends on all the core orbitals. Similar equations
may be written for (virtual) excited orbitals ϕm.

We solved the DHF equations in the cavity using a B-
spline basis set technique by Johnson et al. [14]. This
technique is based on the Galerkin method: the DHF
equations are expressed in terms of an extremum of an
action integral SA. The boundary conditions are incor-
porated in the SA as well. Further, the action integral
is expanded in terms of a ﬁnite set of basis functions
(B-splines). Minimization of such SA with respect to
expansion coeﬃcients reduces solving integro-diﬀerential
DHF equations to solving symmetric generalized eigen-
value problem of linear algebra. The resulting set of basis
functions is ﬁnite and can be considered as numerically
complete. In a typical calculation we used a set of basis
functions expanded over 100 B-splines.

Given a numerically complete set of DHF eigenfunc-
, the permanent atomic EDM, Eq.(2), may be

where a runs over occupied and m over virtual orbitals.
Here hCP is either a semileptonic interaction, Eq. (3), or
an interaction with the nuclear Schiﬀ moment, Eq. (4).
An additional peculiarity related to the Dirac equation is
mec2)
an appearance of negative energy states (εm <
in the summation over intermediate states in Eq. (11).
We have veriﬁed that these states introduce a completely
negligible correction to the computed EDMs.

−

To improve upon the DHF approximation, we have also
computed EDMs using RRPA method [15]. This approx-
imation describes a dynamic linear response of an atom to
a perturbing one-body interaction (e.g., HCP). The per-
turbation modiﬁes core orbitals thus changing the DHF
potential. This modiﬁcation of VDHF in turn requires the
orbitals to adjust self-consistently. Such a readjustment
process deﬁnes an inﬁnite series of many-body diagrams,
shown, e.g., in Ref. [7]. The RRPA series can be summed
to all orders using iterative techniques or solving DHF-
like equations. We used an alternative method of solu-
tions based on the use of basis functions [16]. As an input,
we used the DHF basis functions generated in the cavity
(see discussion above), i.e. the boundary conditions were
satisﬁed automatically. As a result of solving the RRPA
equations, we have determined a quasi-complete set of
particle-hole excited states and their energies. Then the
EDMs are determined using expressions similar to Eq.
(1) and (2).

Discussion and conclusions — First, we present the
results of our calculations for an isolated atom (Rcav =

Before presenting results for ﬁnite cavity radii, let us
consider individual contributions to EDM from various
shells of Xe atom. These contributions for the Schiﬀ-
moment-induced EDM of an isolated atom are listed
in Table I. A similar table, but for the EDM arising
from semileptonic interactions is given in Ref. [7]. From
these tables we observe that the dominant contribution to
EDMs comes from the outer n = 5 shell. Thus we antic-
ipate that a noticeable density dependence should occur
when Rcav becomes comparable to the size of external
n = 5 shell. We also notice that the contribution from
the outer shell is relatively more important in RRPA cal-
culations than at the DHF level, i.e., the RRPA results
should exhibit stronger density dependence.

The EDM is induced by the nuclear Schiﬀ moment and it is

These qualitative conclusions for a conﬁned atom are
supported by our numerical results, presented in Fig. 1.
Here we plot the ratios of atomic EDMs for the conﬁned
and isolated atoms as a function of Rcav. The EDMs be-
come smaller as the density increases, n
cav. At the
density of liquid Xe, Rcav
4.9 bohr , the more accu-
≈
rate RRPA results show a 25% suppression of the atomic
EDM due to conﬁnement. Overall there is a noticeable
density-dependence of atomic EDM. We expect the EDM
signal (if found) to be broadened. The relevant charac-
teristic width of the signal can be simply estimated from
our Fig. 1 from the mean density ﬂuctuations.

¿From Fig. 1 we notice that both semileptonic– and
Schiﬀ–moment–induced EDMs scale with Rcav in a sim-
ilar fashion. This similarity can be explained from the

Nnl are normalization factors. Therefore the dominant
contribution to the EDM, Eq.(11) arises from mixing of
s and p states. By factorizing the matrix element of hCP
as

we see that the Rcav–independent factor
can
be pulled out of the summation over atomic orbitals in
Eq.(11). Thus, both semileptonic– and Schiﬀ–moment–
induced EDMs exhibit approximately the same scaling
with the cavity radius. A correction to this “similarity
scaling law” may arise, for example, due to diﬀerent se-
lection rules involved for the two EDM operators.

It is worth emphasizing the semi-qualitative nature
of our calculations. The analysis can be improved by
employing more realistic models of liquid environment.
Even within the cell model we could further reﬁne our
analysis. A dense liquid may be considered as a solid
with vacancies, i.e., the decrease of the average bond
length is negligible, rather the nearest-neighbor occu-
pation numbers are decreased compared to solid. Xe
condenses into face-centered cubic structure. The ﬁrst
nearest-neighbor shell contains twelve atoms (partially
justifying the spherical symmetry of the elementary cell).
The density of the solid Xe is 3.54 g/cm3, implying the
half-radius of this shell of 4.2 bohr, somewhat smaller
than Rcav
4.9 bohr for liquid Xe. As follows from
Fig. 1, this diﬀerence leads to more pronounced suppres-
sion of the atomic EDM by 40% per cent.

≈

To reiterate, our work was motivated by anticipated
signiﬁcant improvements in sensitivity to atomic EDMs
in experiments with liquid 129Xe [4]. Here we investi-
gated conﬁning eﬀects of the environment on the EDM
of Xe atom. We carried out the analysis in the frame-
work of the cell model coupled with relativistic atomic-
structure calculations. We found that compared to an
isolated atom, the EDM of an atom of liquid Xe is re-
duced by about 40%. Thus if the experiment with liquid
Xe is carried out with the anticipated sensitivity, we ex-
pect that the inferred constraints on possible sources of
CP-violation would be indeed several orders of magni-
tude better than the present limits.

We would like to thank M. Romalis for discussions.

We report the frequency measurement with an accuracy in the 100 kHz range of several optical
transitions of atomic Sr : 1S0 − 3P1 at 689 nm, 3P1 − 3S1 at 688 nm and 3P0 − 3S1 at 679 nm. Mea-
surements are performed with a frequency chain based on a femtosecond laser referenced to primary
frequency standards. They allowed the determination with a 70 kHz uncertainty of the energy of
the 5s5p 3P0 state and the direct observation of the doubly forbidden1S0 − 3P0 transition of 87Sr
at 698 nm. Frequency measurements are performed for 88Sr and 87Sr, allowing the determination of
3P0, 3P1 and 3S1 isotope shifts, as well as the 3S1 hyperﬁne constants.

INTRODUCTION

Precise measurements of the energy of atomic levels is
of extreme importance for modern physics. To quote a
few examples, for simple atoms (H, He...) they lead to
accurate tests of quantum electrodynamics and give ac-
cess to fundamental constants such as the Rydberg con-
stant [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. For more complex systems they give
rise to new generations of atomic clocks with the per-
spective of an improved deﬁnition of the SI second (see
e.g. [6]), they allow stringent laboratory tests of local po-
sition invariance [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and combined with mass
ratio measurements they lead to accurate determinations
of the ﬁne structure constant α [12, 13, 14, 15].

Many of the atomic transitions of interest lie in the
optical domain of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the
heroic times of optical frequency metrology, measure-
ments were based on phase coherent harmonic frequency
chains which required a speciﬁc heavy apparatus for each
transition under consideration [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].
Very few atomic or molecular resonances have been mea-
sured directly with this technique [22]. A few more tran-
sitions have been indirectly measured with decent accu-
racy thanks to their coincidental vicinity to one of these
few references. The vast majority of atomic transitions
however are only known to within a few hundred MHz,
limited by the mechanical quality of spectrometers. The
situation has dramatically changed over the last few years
with the advent of optical frequency combs [22, 23]. Very
compact and simple apparatus are now available which
in principle allow the phase coherent comparison of any
frequencies ranging from the GHz to the PHz domain.

We describe here the extensive use of this technique for
the spectroscopy of Sr atoms. We report the frequency
measurement with an accuracy in the hundred kHz range
of the 1S0
3S1 transitions at
689, 688 and 679 nm respectively (see Fig. 1). The mea-
surements are performed with both 88 and 87 isotopes.

−1) of the transitions involved in the experiment. Two iso-
(s
topes have been studied, 88Sr and 87Sr of natural abundance
82 % and 7 % respectively. 87Sr possesses a hyperﬁne struc-
ture (I = 9/2) which is not shown here for clarity. The 698 nm
transition is weakly allowed for 87Sr by hyperﬁne coupling.

For the latter, hyperﬁne components have been measured
giving access to the hyperﬁne parameters of the 3S1 state
and to the isotope shifts of 3P0, 3P1 and 3S1. The in-
terest of these measurements is illustrated by the ﬁrst
3P0 transition of 87Sr which we
observation of the 1S0
have reported in [24]. This was made possible by the in-
direct determination of the 3P0 state energy given by the
measurements detailed here. The direct frequency mea-
surement with a 15 kHz accuracy of this transition in
turn nicely conﬁrms the indirect determination. It also
opens the way to a new generation of optical frequency
standards with atoms conﬁned in a dipole trap [25].

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

All frequency measurements were performed with the
experimental set up sketched in Fig. 2. An extended cav-
ity laser diode (ECLD1) is locked to a high ﬁnesse cav-
ity using the Pound-Drever-Hall method [26] with perfor-
mances reported in Ref. [27]. This laser has a linewidth

is detailed in Ref. [28]. For these experiments the MOT
is typically loaded with 107 atoms of 88Sr or 106 atoms
of 87Sr. At steady state, the atomic cloud has a 1/e2
diameter of about 2 mm and a temperature of 2 mK.

III. FREQUENCY MEASUREMENTS OF THE
1S0 − 3P1 TRANSITION

−

The 1S0

3P1 transition at 689 nm is easy to detect
since it involves the ground state. We use saturated ﬂuo-
rescence in an atomic beam which design was previously
described in Ref. [28]. This atomic beam is collimated
to a diameter of 4 mm. The atomic ﬂux is about 1012
at.s−1 at an average velocity close to 500 m.s−1. Atoms
are probed by a retro-reﬂected laser beam orthogonal to
the atomic beam. A typical spectrum recorded for 88Sr
is shown in Fig.3. For frequency measurements, the laser
is locked to the Lamb dip at the center of the Doppler
proﬁle.

To minimize the ﬁrst order Doppler eﬀect, the laser
beam is retro-reﬂected by a cat eye allowing for a ﬁne
cancellation of the angle between the two counterpropa-
gating laser beams. The cat eye is designed with a 15 cm
focal length lens and a plane mirror located at the beam
waist. The alignment of the incident and retro-reﬂected
beams is performed by equalizing central frequencies of
both the Doppler proﬁle in single and double pass opera-
tion and the Lamb dip. With this scheme, the ﬁrst order
Doppler eﬀect corresponding to an eventual residual an-
gle is less than 1 kHz.

The Zeeman sub-levels are split by a static magnetic
ﬁeld parallel to the atomic beam. The scan in Fig. 3 is
recorded with a laser polarization forming a non-zero an-
gle with the static magnetic ﬁeld of 1.5 mT. All three
Zeeman components of 88Sr are then visible. Frequency

ments. A ﬁrst extended cavity laser diode (ECLD1) is locked
to a high ﬁnesse Fabry-P´erot cavity. 100 µW of its output
power are sent to a frequency chain based on a femtosecond
laser for absolute frequency measurement. A second laser
(ECLD2), oﬀset-phase locked to ECDL1, is used to probe the
strontium atoms. Noise and frequency oﬀsets introduced by
optical ﬁbers are negligible in this experiment. EOM: electro-

of 35 Hz.
Its absolute frequency is continuously mea-
sured vs BNM-SYRTE primary frequency standards with
a scheme based on a self referenced femtosecond Ti:Sapph
laser [22, 23]. The fractional resolution of this measure-
10−13 for a one second averaging time
ment is typically 3
(corresponding to 100 Hz in the region of the spectrum
involved here). ECLD1 is used as a frequency reference
for a second laser, ECLD2, that probes the strontium
atoms. ECLD2 is oﬀset-phase locked to ECLD1: The
beat-note between both lasers is detected by an avalanche
photodiode (APD) and mixed with the output of a radio-
frequency synthesizer to generate the oﬀset phase lock er-
ror signal. The bandwidth of the servo control is 2 MHz.
By actuating the RF synthesizer, the light of ECLD2
which is sent to the atoms can be continuously tuned to
any frequency between two modes of the cavity of free
spectral range 1.5 GHz. This point was of importance
for the ﬁrst detection of the transitions since their fre-
quencies were not accurately known. To measure all the
atomic resonances, two sets of lasers are used. The ﬁrst
set can be tuned from 675 to 685 nm, the second one from
685 to 698 nm.

Except for the 1S0

3P1 transition, the frequency mea-
surements are made by probing a sample of cold atoms
collected in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). An atomic
beam is decelerated in a Zeeman slower and captured at
the crossing-point of three retro-reﬂected beams tuned to
1P1 transition at 461 nm. The setup

measurements are performed on the m = 0 - m’ = 0 tran-
sition, insensitive to the ﬁrst order Zeeman eﬀect.

×

For 87Sr, which possesses a nuclear spin I = 9/2, all
possible transitions depend on the magnetic ﬁeld to ﬁrst
3P1, F = 9/2, m
order. The frequency shift of state
i
|
is m
0.8 MHz/mT. However, one expects all Zeeman
sub-levels of the ground state to be equally populated in
the thermal beam. In addition, since the magnetic ﬁeld
orientation is orthogonal to the probe laser propagation
axis, the laser polarisation has equal σ+ and σ− compo-
nents. One then expects the sub-Doppler structure of the
resonance to be fully symmetric. Insensitivity of the fre-
quency measurements to the magnetic ﬁeld is conﬁrmed
experimentally (Fig. 4).

The main eﬀect in the accuracy budget is the residual
Doppler frequency shift induced by wave front distortion.
It is a somewhat diﬃcult task to model this eﬀect. A 3D
map of the wave front in the crossing region of the laser
and the atomic beam would be needed. Furthermore,
the velocity and spatial distributions of the atoms in the
thermal beam should be accounted for. We put an upper
bound to this eﬀect by performing frequency measure-
ments as a function of the probe laser power with several
laser beam geometries (leading to diﬀerent wave fronts).
The results of this study which was conducted for 88Sr
are summarized in Fig. 5. At low laser power the mea-
surements performed in all geometries tend towards the
same frequency to within
20 kHz, while at high power a
dispersion of hundreds of kHz is observed. This result can
be explained by means of the sensitivity function which
reﬂects the atomic response to a localized ﬁeld pertur-
bation [29]. At high laser power, the sensitivity function
exhibits strong variations on small scales resulting in an

±

increased sensitivity to the details of the wavefront. At
low intensity however, the sensitivity function is smooth
and local phase variations are averaged down. The value
of the measured frequency then tends towards the value
which would be measured with the best plane wave ap-
proximation of the beam wave front. Our ﬁnal value for
88Sr is the mean of the measurements performed at a
power below 1 mW, to which we attribute a conserva-
tive error bar of 20 kHz. It is reported in Table I and is
in good agreement with the measurement performed by
Ferrari et al [30].

For 87Sr frequency measurements have not been done
at these low laser powers. Due to its small natural abun-
dance (7 %) and to the Zeeman degeneracy of the ground
state the sub-Doppler structure is hardly detectable in
the absence of saturation broadening. The atomic fre-
quency is obtained by comparison to 88Sr: at high laser
power, we alternate measurements of the 87Sr and 88Sr
resonances. We have checked that the diﬀerence be-
tween both atomic frequencies does not depend on the
laser beam geometry to within 50 kHz (Fig. 4). Only the
hyperﬁne component of 87Sr with F ′ = 9/2 has been
measured with this technique thanks to its small fre-
quency diﬀerence with the 88Sr transition. Since the
hyperﬁne structure of the 3P1 state of 87Sr is very well
known [31] this particular measurement allows the deter-
mination of the two other hyperﬁne components (see ta-
ble I). One can also extract the isotope shift of state
3P1, ∆87,88 [3P1] = 62 150 (70) kHz, with an accuracy im-
provement by more than one order of magnitude [32, 33].

IV. FREQUENCY MEASUREMENTS OF THE
3P1 − 3S1 TRANSITION

−

Measurements of the 3P1

3S1 transition at 688 nm are
−
performed with cold atoms in the MOT in which the 3P1
state is slightly populated. Indeed, while cycling on the
1S0
1P1 transition, atoms occasionally decay to 1D2 by
spontaneous emission (Fig. 1). This state has two main
decay channels to 3P1 and 3P2, with respective branching
ratios 67% and 33% [34]. Atoms reaching 3P1 decay back
to the ground state fast enough that they are kept in the
trap while atoms in the metastable 3P2 state are lost for
our experiment. This process limits the lifetime of the
MOT to 30 to 50 ms, depending on the trapping laser
parameters.
The 3P1

3S1 transition is detected by modifying
this radiative process. If a laser resonant to one of the
3S1 transitions is added to the trap, atoms in
3P1
the corresponding 3P1 state are pumped to 3P2 and 3P0
metastable states. They escape the trap instead of de-
caying back to the ground state. This additional loss

−

−

meacanism decreases the trapped atom number. Figure 6
shows the relative MOT ﬂuorescence (at 461 nm) as a
3S1
function of the 688 nm laser detuning from the 3P1
resonance of 88Sr. Similar resonances are obtained with
all hyperﬁne components of 87Sr. It should be noted that
although the relative population of the 3P1 state is lower
than 10−3, the signal is very large indeed. The decrease
of the MOT blue ﬂuorescence can reach 40% for 87Sr and
70% for 88Sr at suﬃciently high laser intensity.

−

Atoms are probed in a standing wave conﬁguration by
retroreﬂecting the 688 nm laser beam which shines the
trapped atoms. The two counterpropagating beams are
aligned to better than 1 mrad. The residual Doppler ef-
fect due to a possible asymmetry of the velocity distri-
bution of the trapped atoms is well below 1 kHz.

We have studied the contrast and width of the reso-
nances as a function of the 688 nm laser intensity. Theo-
retical values can be simply derived from the rate equa-
tions of the MOT dynamics if one assumes that the cap-
ture process is not aﬀected by the probe beam. For a
given laser intensity at the center of the trapping region,
we observe a strong discrepancy between experimental
data and the model. The experimental resonance width
is about ten times smaller than expected while the actual
laser intensity for which the contrast is half its maximal
value is a hundred times higher. This shows that the
eﬀective laser intensity is much smaller than its value
at the center of the laser beam. A signiﬁcant fraction
of the atoms contributing to the signal are presumably
pumped at the edge of the beam. They escape the trap
before reaching the central region of the trap. An ac-
curate model accounting for this eﬀect would require a
good knowledge of the spatial and velocity distributions
of the atoms during capture which is a hard task for a
MOT loaded with a Zeeman slower.

The main consequence of numerous atoms being ex-
cited away from the trap center is an increased sensitiv-
ity of the frequency measurements to the Zeeman eﬀect
induced by the MOT magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld
gradient is 1.8 mT.cm−1 in standard operation and the
Zeeman eﬀect is of the order of 14 MHz.mT−1. The ac-
tual frequency shift depends on hardly known parameters
such as the atom spatial distribution in the capture pro-
cess or the population of the various Zeeman sub-levels.
Our error bars are then deduced from experimental obser-
vations as described in the next paragraphs. Frequencies
of the atomic resonances at 688 nm could be obtained
with an accuracy of 300 kHz and 500 kHz for 87Sr and
88Sr respectively. 88Sr is more sensitive to the Zeeman
eﬀect due to its higher Land´e factors (see Tab. VII).

Fig. 7 shows that frequency shifts of several MHz can
be observed for the 88Sr resonance when the MOT mag-
netic ﬁeld gradient is varied. These shifts depend on the
laser polarization. Although measurements with diﬀer-
ent polarizations come closer and closer from each other
when decreasing the ﬁeld gradient, extrapolation to zero
is not perfect. This is due to an asymmetry of the reso-
nance for other polarizations than the one labelled Polar1

688nm laser detuning from resonance [MHz]

FIG. 8: 3P1 − 3S1 resonances of 88Sr observed for various
laser polarizations. Continuous lines in all plots represent a
ﬁt of the resonance detected with Polar1 (see text).

(Fig. 8). For this polarization, the resonance is nearly
symmetric and the sensitivity to the Zeeman eﬀect is the
minimal (300 kHz/[mT/cm]). For 87Sr and 88Sr, we take
as a ﬁnal frequency the extrapolated value at zero ﬁeld
of the measurements performed with Polar1. For 87Sr,
we indeed observe a smaller dependence of the frequency

The eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient can also be
seen by varying the 688 nm laser intensity (Fig. 9). At
increasing laser powers atoms further and further away
from the trap center (where the magnetic ﬁeld is higher)
contribute to the signal. In order to minimize this eﬀect,
the ﬁnal frequency is extrapolated from measurements
done at low laser intensity only, about 1 mW.cm−2.

In Table II are reported the frequencies obtained for all
transitions at 688 nm[44]. These measurements can be
partly cross-checked by extracting the accurately known
hyperﬁne splitting of the 3P1 state of 87Sr [31]. Values
are reported in Table III. The agreement between val-
ues deduced from our measurements via diﬀerent 3S1, F ′
states on the one side and between our values and those
of Ref.[31] on the other side, strongly assesses the con-
servativeness of our error bars.

A direct detection of the 3P0

3S1 transition by the
previous technique is not possible. Unlike 3P1, 3P0 is
not populated in the MOT. We have performed the mea-
surement in two steps. First, we induce a light shift on
3S1 transition with a 679 nm laser close to the
the 3P1
3P0
3S1 resonance (see Fig. 1). This allows the determi-
nation of the frequency of the atomic transition at 679 nm
to better than 1 MHz. In a second step, we use coherent
Λ
population trapping resonances in the
}
system for a direct measurement of the 3P0
3P1 ﬁne
structure splitting. This second step which could only be
applied to 87Sr, leads to an uncertainty of 50 kHz on the
ﬁne structure measurement.

For both steps, the two sets of lasers as described in

tion the beam waist radii of the probe lasers (ECLD2 in
Fig. 2) are w679=1.3 mm and w688=0.9 mm respectively.

Light shift measurements are plotted in Fig. 10. The
679 nm laser induces a frequency dependent light shift of
3S1 which is deduced from measurements of the 3P1
3S1
−
transition with the 688 nm laser. The 3P0
3S1 atomic
frequency corresponds to the center of symmetry of the
light shift curve. For the signal to be as large as possible
the total available power at 679 nm is used. A 2.4 mW
laser beam shines the trapped atoms in a standing wave
conﬁguration. In order to minimize the number of atoms
being excited far from the MOT center the 688 nm laser
has a low intensity, typically I688=0.2 mW.cm−2.
It
should be noted that the measured light shift is about 10
times smaller than the value derived from a simple two-
level atom model assuming a transition natural width

at 679 nm is obtained with a statistical uncertainty of
400 kHz. We add a 500 kHz uncertainty due to the Zee-

state and recover the trapping process. If we gradually
increase the 679 nm laser detuning, the CPT resonance
moves sidewards and reverses sign when it reaches the

The CPT resonance allows for a direct measurement of

the 3P0, F = 9/2
of 87Sr. Three measurements have been performed with
each of the 3S1 hyperﬁne levels as a third state in the
Λ system. For 88Sr and others 3P1 hyperﬁne states of
87Sr, the CPT resonances are blurred due to the higher
sensitivity of the involved states to magnetic ﬁeld. Only
a deformation of the 688 nm resonance has been observed
which did not allow for accurate measurements.

The ﬁne structure measurements are performed with
the frequency of both 688 nm and 679 nm lasers locked
to the atomic signal. Three digital servo loops run in
parallel. Servo A locks the 688 nm laser frequency to
the 3P1
3S1 transition. This is done by alternating
measurements at frequencies AI and AII indicated in
Fig. 12. With servo B, the 688 nm laser is locked onto the
CPT peak thanks to measurements at frequencies B1 and
B2 (Fig. 12). Finally servo C controls the frequency of
the 679 nm laser so as to equalize the frequencies of servos
A and B. Measurements for servo A and B are interlaced
with variable durations. The ﬁne structure measurement

of servos A and C. A frequency resolution of 10 kHz is
achieved in a few minutes of averaging.

With this scheme, both lasers are locked on their re-
spective atomic resonance which enables light shift free
measurements. Indeed, no shift is observed as a function
of the 679 nm laser intensity (see Fig. 13.a). When the
688 nm laser intensity is increased however, we do ob-
serve a shift (Fig. 13.b). As previously reported for the
3P1
3S1 measurements (Fig. 9), this eﬀect is attributed
to the Zeeman eﬀect induced by the MOT ﬁeld gradi-
ent. Increasing the laser intensity enhances the number
of atoms excited away from the zero magnetic ﬁeld re-
gion. It is to be noted that using a 679 nm laser at high
100 mW.cm−2) does not enhance the Zee-
intensity (
man eﬀect because the 688 nm laser performs the spatial
selection.

P0, F = 9/2 clock transition of 87Sr. We ﬁnd ν =

cisive step toward the direct observation of this transition
which we describe in the following section with more de-
tails than in [24].

VI. DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF THE
1S0 − 3P0 TRANSITION

−

For 87Sr, the 1S0

3P0 transition at 698 nm is slightly
allowed by hyperﬁne coupling of 3P0 to 1P1 and 3P1. Its
theoretical linewidth is estimated to 1 mHz [25, 39]. De-
tection of such a narrow line is a technical challenge with
atoms at 2 mK even if its frequency is already known. To
obtain a detectable signal we have developed an original
technique based on the MOT dynamics and the use of a
698 nm laser frequency sweep. The principle consists in
inducing in the MOT a leak to 3P0 with a 698 nm laser.
Detection of a small number of atoms in this state is
made diﬃcult by the absence of cycling transition from
3P0 transition
this state. The detection of the 1S0
is then performed by measuring the loss induced in the
MOT with the 461 nm ﬂuorescence of the trapped atoms.
In order to excite the largest possible fraction of atoms,
the 698 nm laser is used at the highest available power,
14 mW. The laser beam is sent four times through the
MOT forming two standing waves. Both waves are tilted
by 5 mrad with respect to each-other and by 45◦ with
respect to vertical. Their waist radius is 1.3 mm. With
these parameters, the resonance is broadened by satura-
tion to 1.8 kHz. On the other hand, the Doppler broad-
ening for our 2 mK atomic sample is 1.5 MHz (full width
at half-maximum (FWHM)). Only one atom out of 103
is then expected to be resonant with the laser at a given
time.

−

However, the MOT dynamics can lead to an ampliﬁ-
cation of the transfer rate to 3P0. Indeed, with the laser
parameters given above, the duration of a π pulse on the
narrow transition is 0.5 ms. This is about a 100 times
shorter than the MOT lifetime.
It is then in principle
possible to enhance the fraction of excited atoms by the
same factor if one accumulates atoms in 3P0. The in-
duced MOT loss should then reach several %. This works
only if two conditions are fulﬁlled. First, the transfer rate
to 3P0 has to remain constant. This is at ﬁrst sight not
the case since the 698 nm laser excitation creates a dip
in the velocity distribution of atoms in the ground state.
Second, atoms once in the 3P0 state have to actually es-
cape the trapping process.
If they stay resonant with
the 698 nm laser frequency, they ﬂip back to the ground
state by stimulated emission. To ensure both conditions,
several methods can be thought of. For instance, the
MOT beams could be used to rethermalize atoms and
ﬁll the dip in the the ground state velocity distribution.
For the escape condition, optical pumping to 3P2 state

could be performed with a laser tuned to the 3P0
3S1
resonance as in Ref. [40]. Alternatively, both conditions
can be simultaneously fulﬁlled by sweeping the laser fre-
quency. This is doable if the frequency ramp is perfectly
controlled so as to not degrade the accuracy of the fre-
quency measurements.

−

We have used a simpler method based on the Doppler
eﬀect induced by the acceleration of atoms by gravity.
The experiment is operated sequentially. By means of
acousto-optic modulators we alternate capture and cool-
ing phases with the 461 nm lasers and probe phases with
the 698 nm laser. During probe phases atoms are freely
falling. Due to the 45◦ angle formed by the 698 nm beam
and the vertical, the frequency sweep caused by gravity
amounts to 10 kHz/ms. Both atoms transferred to the
3P0 state and the corresponding dip in the velocity dis-
tribution of the ground state are then detuned from the
laser excitation. The pulsed operation of the experiment
also prevents any light shift of the ground state by the
MOT beams during probe phases.

We have developed a simple model of the loss induced
in the trap by excitation to 3P0. We compute the transi-
tion probability for an atom probed by two counterprop-
agating beams of 28 mW each, hence averaging down the
eﬀect of the interference due to the 5 mrad tilt between
the actual beams. We also neglect spontaneous emis-
sion and treat the atom as a two level system. For an
atom of initial velocity ~v0 we numerically solve the opti-
cal Bloch equations with a time dependent detuning from
resonance ∆(t). Accounting for the gravity acceleration
~g it writes down as:

∆(t) = ∆0 + ε α t

Here δ is the laser detuning in the laboratory frame, ~k the
probe laser wave vector and ε =
1 depending on the di-
rection of the laser beam interacting with the atoms. We
have neglected interferences between counterpropagating
laser beams considering they address diﬀerent atomic ve-
locity classes. This is true for large enough detuning,
typically
> 10 Ω, with Ω the Rabi frequency. Ac-
counting for both beams would lead to a sub-Doppler
structure at the center of the resonance which was not
resolved experimentally.

The transition probabilities obtained for various val-
ues of ∆0 in the case ε =
1 are plotted in solid lines
−
in Fig. 14. When atoms with a blue initial detuning
(∆0 > 0) are brought onto resonance by the acceleration
of gravity, the transition probability rapidly increases and
then tends to stabilize around a high value, for instance
0.56 when ∆0 = 5 Ω. Also shown on Fig. 14 (dashed
lines) is the transition probability which would be ob-
tained in the absence of gravity, i.e. for a constant value
∆(t) = ∆0.
It is clear that if the interaction time is
suﬃcient, a signiﬁcant transition probability is obtained

gravity is accounted for.

The evolution of the transition probability of an ini-
tially blue detuned atom is remindful of adiabatic rapid
passage. Indeed our experimental parameters are at the
edge of the adiabatic transfer condition [41]:

698 nm laser detuning from resonance (MHz) 

FIG. 16: Direct observation of 1S0 − 3P0 transition of 87Sr.
The line is broadened by the Doppler eﬀect to 1.4 MHz
(FWHM) due to the temperature of the atoms. The max-
imal value of the MOT ﬂuorescence corresponds to 3 × 106
trapped atoms.

×

gravity the loss rapidly stabilizes around a small value:
10−3 of the total number of trapped atoms. This
1.6
value is close to the intuitive value given by the ratio of
saturation over Doppler broadenings. By contrast, grav-
ity enables to induce loss in the MOT that keep increas-
ing with the interaction time: more and more atoms are
brought onto resonance due to gravity. An even faster
frequency sweep would lead to a higher increase of the
loss in the MOT. For instance, with a 100 kHz/ms ramp,
a further increase of 40% is expected. This would how-
ever be at the cost of an experimental complication. The
frequency ramp should be perfectly controlled and syn-
chronized with the experimental time sequence.

Our time sequence consists in alternating phases of
cooling and capture of 3 ms duration with probe phases of
1 ms duration. This sequence, which was experimentally
optimized, results from a trade-oﬀ between the MOT cap-
ture eﬃciency, the ballistic expansion of the atomic cloud
during probe phases, and the eﬃciency of excitation to
3P0. From the results of our model and given the 40 ms
lifetime of the MOT with this time sequence parameters,
we expect a contrast of the resonance of 6%.

−

In Fig. 16 is shown the observed 1S0

3P0 resonance.
The contrast is 1%, 6 times lower than the expected
value. The discrepancy between experimental and ex-
pected value may have several causes. Neglecting the
angle between both standing waves may lead to an over-
estimate of the MOT loss by a factor of nearly 2.
In
addition, the ballistic expansion of the atomic cloud has
been neglected in the model. During probe phases, atoms
are moving away from the 698 nm beam center due to
their residual velocity. The actual Rabi frequency thus
decreases with time. This also leads to a decrease of the
transfer rate to 3P0.

10

 

−

We have locked the 698 nm laser to the 1S0

3P0 res-
onance with a digital servo loop. The error signal is de-
rived from MOT ﬂuorescence measurements performed
sequentially on both sides of the resonance. The du-
ration of each ﬂuorescence measurement is a multiple
of the time sequence period used to probe the atoms.
The error signal is integrated and fed back to the syn-
thesizer driving the oﬀset-phase lock of the probe laser
ECLD2 (Fig 2). The mean frequency of the measure-
ments is 429 228 004 235 kHz with a residual statistical
uncertainty of 15 kHz.

At this level, systematic eﬀects are negligible. The
residual Doppler eﬀect is well below 1 kHz due to the
standing wave conﬁguration. The Zeeman eﬀect amounts
to less than 1 kHz in spite of the MOT ﬁeld gradient since
Land´e factors of 1S0 and 3P0 states are extremely small
(Tab. VII). Finally measurements performed with im-
perfect extinction by the acousto-optic modulators show
that the residual light shift by the 461 nm light is also
below 1 kHz. The Doppler proﬁle being shifted from the
atomic resonance by the recoil frequency [42], the mea-
sured mean frequency has to be corrected by 4.7 kHz[45].
We ﬁnally obtain:

ν (1S0

3P0) = 429 228 004 230 (15) kHz.

−

This value is in agreement with the indirect determina-
tion, the diﬀerence between both frequencies being 1.4 σ.

Conclusion

−

−

−

We have measured the frequency of the 1S0
3S1 (tab. II) and 3P0

3P1
3S1 (tab. IV) op-
(tab. I), 3P1
tical transitions for both strontium isotopes 87Sr et 88Sr.
The reported accuracy is in the 100 kHz range, an im-
provement by three orders of magnitude as compared
to previous values [37]. This was made possible by the
versatility of femto-second laser based optical frequency
measurements and in turn nicely illustrates the potential
of this technique. It is worth noting that with traditional
harmonic frequency chain measurements, four quite dif-
ferent (and complex) experiments should have been built,
one for each speciﬁc wavelength: 679 nm, 688 nm, 689 nm
and ﬁnally 698 nm.

These measurements lead to a better knowledge of
atomic Sr yielding accurate values of the hyperﬁne struc-
ture parameters of state 3S1 and of the isotope shift of
states 3P0, 3P1 and 3S1. Thanks to the indirect determi-
nation of the energy of state 3P0 the 1S0
3P0 clock tran-
sition of 87Sr could be directly detected. Although this
transition is extremely forbidden (its natural linewidth is
1 mHz) we have been able to observe it on a sample at
a temperature of 2 mK by making use of the magneto-
optical trap dynamics. We have induced a leak in the
MOT to state 3P0 which enhanced the contrast of the
transition by one order of magnitude as compared to sim-
ple saturation broadening. We performed a direct mea-
surement of the clock transition frequency which is found

−

in agreement with the indirect determination. The tech-
nique used here could be applied to detect other strongly
3P0 transi-
forbidden lines like the slightly broader 1S0
tion of fermionic Yb. The lifetime of Yb atoms in a MOT
using the 1S0
3P1 transition [43] is typically two orders
of magnitude longer than our Sr MOT and the contrast
of the resonance could then approach 100 %.

−

−

Although this clock transition is interesting in it-
self, whatever the scheme used to probe the atoms,
the frequency measurement of the 1S0
3P0 of 87Sr is
the ﬁrst step towards the construction of a new gen-
eration of atomic clocks: optical clocks with trapped
atoms [25, 40].
It seems realistic with these clocks to
reach in a close future a fractional frequency instability
around 10−16 τ −1/2 [27] together with an accuracy in the
10−17 range [25].

Abstract
Resonant formation of muonic molecule dtµ in tµ atom collisions with condensed H/D/T targets
is considered. The resonant-formation rates are expressed in terms of a resonance correlation
function which is a generalization of the Van Hove single-particle correlation function. The derived
formulas are applied to polycrystalline hydrogen-isotope targets. Numerical calculation of the rates
are performed using the isotropic Debye model of a solid, for tµ energies up to about 1 eV and
for low pressure. An estimation of condensed-matter eﬀects in resonant formation explain some
unexpected results found in many experiments. It is shown that these eﬀects are signiﬁcant even
for high collision energies, which is important for interpretation of the time-of-ﬂight measurements
at TRIUMF. The calculated mean values of the rates, for ﬁxed target temperatures, are in good
agreement with the PSI and RIKEN-RAL experiments performed in solid D/T targets.

INTRODUCTION

A theoretical study of resonant formation of the muonic molecular ion dtµ in condensed
hydrogen-isotope targets is the main subject of this paper. Formation of dtµ is a key pro-
cess of muon-catalyzed fusion (µCF) in a D/T mixture, which attracted particular interest
because one muon can catalyze more than 100 fusions [1–4] according to the reaction

Investigation of the µCF cycle in various hydrogen-isotope targets is also important for
studies of various phenomena in atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics (see reviews [5–7]).
Resonant dtµ formation is due to the presence of the loosely bound state of dtµ [1] with the
rotational quantum number J = 1, the vibrational quantum number v = 1, and the binding
energy εJv=11
0.63 eV. Theoretical methods for calculation of the resonant-formation
rates were developed for many years (see e.g., Refs. [8–16]). These methods, taking into
account resonant formation in tµ collision with one or few molecules, give good agreement
with the experimental data for dilute gaseous targets. However, such theory is unable to
explain various phenomena found in experiments with dense ﬂuid and solid hydrogen-isotope
targets. This concerns a nonlinear dependence of the formation rate on the target density [4,
17], puzzling temperature eﬀects [18], and the resonance proﬁles determined by the time-
of-ﬂight experiments [19–22]. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the inﬂuence of many-
body eﬀects on muonic-molecule formation.
In particular, various collective phenomena
can signiﬁcantly change this process, which one can expect knowing their role in resonant
neutron absorption by nuclei bound in condensed matter [23, 24].

Condensed-matter eﬀects in resonant neutron absorption can be expressed in terms of
the single-particle correlation function [24] which has been introduced by Van Hove [25] for
description of incoherent neutron scattering. This function depends on energy and momen-
tum transfer to a target and its properties. It is possible to adapt this formalism to the case
of resonant muonic-molecule formation.

First estimation of the dtµ-formation rate in solid molecular hydrogens was given by
Fukushima [26]. He employed a correlation-function formalism, performed ab initio calcula-
tion of lattice dynamics to determine target properties, and demonstrated an important role
of phonon processes in resonant dtµ formation. His calculation was limited to high target
10 kbar), where solid hydrogens are classical crystals. However, in µCF exper-
pressures (
iments, only zero or low pressures have been applied. As a result, solid-hydrogen targets
are quantum crystals with large amplitudes of the zero-point vibration and very diﬀerent
properties. Thus, a special approach is necessary to solve lattice dynamics [27, 28]. Owing
to this fact and to a rough estimation of the transition-matrix elements for dtµ formation,
the results of Ref. [26] are about ﬁve times greater than the rates determined in the experi-
ments [2, 4]. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the calculated formation rate, for D2
molecule bound in solid D/T, is opposite to what has been recently seen in the RIKEN-RAL
experiment [18].

In the case of ddµ molecule, the contributions from nonphonon and phonon processes
to the formation rate in solid deuterium have been discussed in Refs. [29, 30] and then
in Refs. [31, 32]. A theoretical method of calculating the resonant ddµ-formation rate, valid
also for low-pressure solid hydrogens, has been presented in detail in Ref. [30]. The correla-
tion function used for description of solid polycrystalline D2 properties has been derived for
the Debye model of an isotropic solid. The model parameters, such as the Debye temperature

2

and the lattice constants, has been taken from the available data including quantum-crystal
eﬀects [27, 28]. Since the resonances in ddµ formation on an free D2 molecule are very nar-
row, their proﬁles are well-described by the delta function. As a result, the corresponding
formation rates in a solid are expressed in terms of the same incoherent correlation function
that is employed for description of incoherent neutron scattering. The theoretical ddµ-
formation rates lead to the time spectra of dd-fusion products which are in good agreement
with the data taken at TRIUMF [33].

Below we present a method of calculation of the dtµ-resonant-formation rates in con-
densed hydrogens, for wide intervals of pressure and tµ collision energy. The proﬁles of dtµ
resonances for a free-molecule are described by the Breit-Wigner function [9, 34]. In Ref. [24],
such proﬁles have been taken into account for neutron or γ-ray resonant absorption by heavy
nuclei. It has been assumed that the nuclear mass is not practically changed after absorp-
tion. As a result, a standard incoherent correlation function was suﬃcient for description of
this process. In the case of muonic molecule formation in hydrogens, the mass of a target
molecule increases greatly after muonic-atom absorption and creation of a small muonic-
molecular ion. Therefore, we introduce a special resonance correlation function, which in-
cludes this eﬀect into the target dynamics. Only at lowest collision energies (. 10 meV),
considered in Refs. [26, 30], an approximation which neglects this mass change can be ap-
plied since then resonant formation takes place practically in a rigid lattice. Such approach is
valid for interpretation of experiments performed at lowest temperatures and well-described
by steady-state kinetics. On the other hand, correct explanation of the time-of-ﬂight exper-
iments using energetic (
1 eV) beams of muonic atoms [20–22] require the knowledge of
the formation rates at intermediate and higher energies.

∼

In Sec. II, a brief description of resonant dtµ formation in an isolated hydrogen-isotope
molecule is given. The method of the formation-rate calculation in condensed targets, using
the energy-dependent transition-matrix elements obtained for a single molecule is discussed
in Sec. III. In particular, the formulas for the resonant-formation rates in harmonic polycrys-
talline hydrogens are derived. They can be applied to both dtµ and ddµ resonant formation.
The results of numerical calculations for dtµ are presented in Sec. IV. A full set of the
transition-matrix elements and the resonance energies, for the molecules HD, D2, and DT
is prepared. The formation rates for typical experimental conditions are plotted. In par-
ticular, contributions from diﬀerent resonances to the total formation rates and ortho-para
eﬀects are shown. A comparison of the calculated rates with some experimental results is
performed.

II. RESONANT FORMATION IN A FREE MOLECULE

First we consider resonant formation of the muonic molecule dtµ (the reasoning is ana-

logical for the ddµ case) in the following reaction:

(tµ)F + (DC)I

νf Kf
C = H, D, or T and c = p, d, or t ,

νiKi −→

(cid:3)

(dtµ)S

Jv cee

,

where DC is a free molecule in the initial rotational-vibrational state (νiKi) with total
nuclear spin I. This spin is taken into account for DC=D2. The tµ atom has total spin
F and center-of-mass (CMS) kinetic energy ε. The molecular complex [(dtµ)cee] is created
in the rotational-vibrational state (νf Kf ) and the molecular ion dtµ, which plays the role

3

of a heavy nucleus of the complex, has total spin S. This process takes place due to the
presence of a loosely bound state of dtµ with rotational number J = 1 and vibrational
number v = 1. The binding energy
released in the reaction above is transferred to
rotational-vibrational degrees of freedom of the created molecular complex [(dtµ)cee]. The
resonance condition is fulﬁlled when ε takes a speciﬁc value ε0
if . This is so-called Vesman’s
mechanism of muonic-molecule formation, introduced in Ref. [8] for the ddµ case. In Fig. 1

molecules DC, function ξ(Ki) = 1 and in the case of D2 we have

A value of factor qd is connected with the number of deuterons in a considered system. When
dtµ is created in tµ collision with an asymmetric molecule DC, qd = 1, and if D2 is a target
molecule, qd = 2. In the case of ddµ formation in an asymmetric DC system, factor qd = 2.
For ddµ formation in a D2 target, one has qd = 4. In Eq. (7), the usual Boltzmann factor
describing the population of rotational states in a gas target is omitted because we calculate
the formation rate separately for each initial rotational state. The rate is averaged over total
spin I of the target molecule. If the muonic atoms in a gas have a steady kinetic-energy
distribution f (ε, T ) at a given target temperature T , Eq. (4) can be averaged over atomic
motion, which gives a mean resonant rate λSF

νiKi,νf Kf (T ).

The formation rate calculated according to Eq. (4) agrees well with experiments in the
case of resonant ddµ formation [38, 39]. On the other hand, assumption of the delta-
function proﬁle for dtµ resonances has led to inconsistency with experiments performed in
low-temperature D/T targets [3, 4, 40, 41]. The measured rates are much greater than the
theoretical predictions based on the Vesman model. It has been pointed by Petrov [9] that,
owing to a ﬁnite lifetime of the complex, the resonance proﬁle should take the Breit-Wigner
form. At low temperatures, this leads to a signiﬁcant contribution from the subthreshold

rate (8) tends to the Vesman form (4).

III. RESONANT FORMATION IN A CONDENSED TARGET

A. General formulas

When formation of a muonic molecule takes place in a dense target, it is necessary to
take into account interactions of the impinging muonic atom with more than one molecule.
Energy transfer to many molecules is possible and formation has a quasiresonant character.
A quasiresonant mechanism of dtµ formation was ﬁrst considered in Ref. [10], for triple
collisions tµ+D2+D2, in order to explain a nonlinear density dependence of the resonant
formation rates. In this case, dtµ formation is possible even if the resonance condition (6)
is not strictly fulﬁlled, because an energy excess in the tµ+D2 system is transferred to the
second D2 molecule. The three-body reactions and broadening of the resonance proﬁles
were then discussed in Refs. [12, 15, 34, 42]. If a target is condensed, i.e., we are dealing
with a solid or a dense ﬂuid, it is indispensable to take into account collective motions
of target molecules in the process of resonant formation. In Fig. 2 is presented a scheme

balance, including energy transfer ω to the target, is shown for the subthreshold resonance
corresponding to the transition νi = 0
νf = 2. Since the target molecule and the complex
[(dtµ)dee] are bound, the corresponding resonance energy εif is diﬀerent from the “free”
resonant energy ε0
if , characterized by the same set of the quantum numbers.
Because of an analogy between resonant absorption of neutrons and resonant formation
of muonic hydrogen molecules, the methods developed in neutron physics can be adapted
for calculation of the rates of resonant ddµ and dtµ formation. Resonant neutron absorption
and emission in condensed targets was ﬁrst considered by Lamb [23]. His method was then
generalized by Singwi and Sj¨olander [24], using the single-particle response function
Si [25],
and applied for description of resonant absorption and emission of γ ray and neutrons
in condensed matter.
In this Section, some expressions for the rate of muonic-molecule
formation in molecule BC bound in a heavy hydrogen-isotope target are derived.

A Hamiltonian Htot of the system, consisting of a tµ atom in the 1S state and a bulk

condensed DC target, can be written down as follows

Htot =

∇2

Rtµ + Htµ(r1) + HDC(̺1) + V (r1, ̺1, ̺2) + H ,

where Maµ is the muonic atom mass and Rtµ denotes the position of tµ center of mass in the
coordinate frame connected with the target (see Fig. 3). Operator Htµ is the Hamiltonian

of a free tµ atom, r1 is the tµ internal vector, and HDC denotes the internal Hamiltonian of
a free D2 molecule. It is assumed that dtµ formation takes place in tµ collision with the lth
molecule DC. The position of its mass center in the target frame is denoted by Rl; ̺1 is
a vector connecting the nuclei inside this molecule. Function V stands for the potential of
the tµ–DC interaction [13], leading to dtµ resonant formation. Vector ̺2 connects the tµ and
the DC centers of masses. We neglect contributions to potential V from the molecules other
than the lth molecule because we assume here that distances between diﬀerent molecules
in the target are much greater than the DC-molecule size. This assumption is valid for
condensed hydrogens under low pressure [27, 28]. The kinetic energy ε of the impinging
muonic atom and its momentum k in the target frame are connected by the relation

ε = k2/2Maµ .

Though in Monte Carlo simulations, involving energy-dependent rates of diﬀerent processes,
the “absolute” formation rates λF
Ki(ε) should be used, it is convenient to introduce an eﬀec-
tive formation rate ¯λF
Ki(ε) that leads to the nuclear fusion in the molecular complex. Fusion
probability depends on back decay which competes with transitions leading to dt fusion.
If the lifetime of the complex is much shorter than its rotational relaxation time, back de-
cay takes place through the strictly elastic channel. When these times are comparable, it
is necessary to include back decay from lower rotational states. Another limit is reached
for very fast rotational relaxation.
In this case, back decay from the ground rotational
state Kf = 0 is dominant. Such situation takes place in dense targets, where interactions
of the compound system with neighboring molecules lead to fast rotational deexcitation.
Calculations presented in Refs. [35, 36] show that rotational relaxation of muonic molecular
complexes, through scattering from neighboring molecules, is fast at liquid hydrogen density.
The eﬀective formation rate is then equal to

It is assumed that the vibrational level νf of the complex is not changed during its lifetime.
Though calculations of vibrational deexcitations of the muonic molecular systems in con-
densed targets have not been performed yet, the available data [28] concerning ν = 1
0
relaxation times in solid (8 µs) and liquid (12 µs at 14.2 K) nH2 suggest that such times are
greater by a few orders of magnitude than the lifetime of the complex.

B. Resonant formation in the strong-binding limit

Evaluation of the response function

res, in a general case, is diﬃcult. The ﬁrst problem
is that the operators Rl(t), H , and ∆H in Eq. (32) do not commute. However, when
resonant formation at low energies (ε . ωD) is concerned, the perturbation operator (17) is
well approximated by its mean value

T = exp(it∆εif ) Yll(k, t).
(cid:11)

Thus, function Yres reduces to the standard correlation function Yll(k, t) for incoherent
scattering [46], multiplied by the factor exp(it∆εif ) describing variation of the mean target
energy due to its mass change. Hence, the formation rate (30) can be written down as
follows

This energy is shifted by ∆εif < 0, compared to the free-molecule resonance energy ε0

Note that such a resonant energy shift was neglected in papers [23, 24], where absorption of
neutrons and γ-rays by heavy nuclei were considered. An estimation of the shift in the case
of γ emission from a nucleus bound in a solid, similar to Eq. (39) was given in Ref. [47].

The Breit-Wigner term in expansion (54) describes recoil-less resonant formation. The
sum with higher powers of 2W correspond to muonic-molecule quasiresonant formation with
simultaneous phonon creation or annihilation. In particular, the term with n = 1 describes
formation connected with creation or annihilation of one phonon.
In the strong-binding
1, only few lowest terms in expansion (54) are signiﬁcant. For 2W & 1, the
limit 2W
approximation (39) and expansion (54) are no longer valid. The phonon expansion derived
above is more general than the similar expansion used for description of γ-ray absorption in
Ref. [24], which includes the Breit-Wigner factor only in the elastic term. This factor should
be included in the phonon terms if the width of a resonance is not negligible compared to
the Debye energy, e.g., in the case of resonant dtµ formation

≪

C. Resonant formation in the weak-binding limit

When the incident momentum of the muonic atom is large, the time of muonic-molecule
formation is short compared to the characteristic time scale of the dynamic response of the
bulk target. Thus, a contribution to the response function (31) from short times is dominant
and it is suﬃcient to keep only linear terms in t while evaluating an asymptotic form of the
correlation function Yres(k, t). In calculations, we shall use the following operator relation:

exp( ˆA) exp( ˆB) = exp( ˆA + ˆB + ˆC) ,

(64)

where

ˆC = 1

This equation is similar (apart from the muonic-molecule factor NmolBif |
for resonant absorption of neutrons in a gas target, obtained by Bethe and Placzek [48].
However, the resonance width (71) and recoil energy (72) take into account a change of the
target particle mass in the absorption process, which is neglected in their work. The Doppler
width (71) is related to the mean kinetic energy ET of the target particle, which in the case
of a solid is given by Eq. (73). This energy is much higher (
5 meV for solid and liquid
≈
D2 [49]) than that for a corresponding Maxwellian gas (ET = 3
2 kBT ), unless the temperature
is suﬃciently high. This phenomenon was ﬁrst taken into account by Lamb [23] in resonant
neutron absorption in solid crystals.

MDC is valid. However, this is only a rough ap-

proximation in the case of muonic-molecule formation because the mass of muonic hydrogen
atom is comparable with the mass of a hydrogen isotope molecule. Note that in the strong-
binding limit, considered in the previous section, mass Mcplx enters only the resonance-energy
shift (39), due to change of the binding energy. The phonon expansion (54) is expressed in
κ2/2Mcplx. The reason is that this expansion
terms of W
∼
is valid for small collision energies, when the target molecule is strongly bound in the lattice.
Therefore, the momentum is transfered to the whole crystal with large mass. The dominant
term of Eq. (54) is the pure Breit-Wigner term, which describes dtµ formation in the rigid
lattice.

Let us ﬁnally note that Eqs. (76) and (78) are general, since they are derived in the impulse
approximation (66) without using speciﬁc properties of a given target, which determine only
the parameter ET . They can be also used for description of resonant absorption processes,
other than muonic-molecule formation, when the mass change cannot be neglected. In such
a case, ΓS should be replaced by the appropriate resonance width.

D. Formation at intermediate energies

The formation rate calculated according the the asymptotic formula (77) becomes very
inaccurate when the collision energy approaches a few ωD.
In particular, this concerns
resonant formation in the rigid lattice, which is dominant at lowest energies. Therefore it
is reasonable to represent the formation rate at these intermediate energies as a sum of the
exact nonphonon term from expansion (54) and subsequent phonon terms obtained in the
impulse approximation. Below is given a brief description of derivation of the appropriate
expression for the formation rate.

Using Eqs. (64) and (69), it can be shown that the following relation

The ﬁrst term of Eq. (85) has been replaced in (88) by the exact Breit-Wigner term. Also the
one-phonon (n = 1) contribution to
res, is replaced here by a more accurate term depending
on g1. Function g1 is calculated on substitution of the exact function γ(t) for a harmonic
solid into Eq. (84). Every multiphonon term in Eq. (88) is represented by the convolution
of the Breit-Wigner proﬁle with a Gaussian obtained using the approximation (86). It now

The form of this expansion is similar to that derived in the strong-binding limit (54). How-
ever, functions gn are valid in the impulse approximation and they are diﬀerent from
the respective functions gΓ n, given by Eq. (55). For the one-phonon term, we have
g1(ω) = gΓ 1(ωα), which is the direct result of using the exact γ(t) in derivation of g1.

longer displays a rich structure. The rate (89) tends therefore to the simpler form (77),
which is characterized by the recoil energy (72) with the correct mass Mcplx.

IV. RESONANT dtµ FORMATION IN SOLID HYDROGENS

In this section, the rates of resonant dtµ formation in solid targets containing HD, D2
and DT molecules are calculated.
It is assumed that these targets are kept at zero or
low pressure, which corresponds to the TRIUMF or RIKEN-RAL experimental conditions.
Since the measurements at TRIUMF were performed using the energetic (
1 eV) beams
of tµ atoms, the rates are evaluated in a wide energy interval. This involves resonant dtµ
formation with excitation of the muonic-molecular complex to a few subsequent vibrational
levels.

∼

The resonance energies and energy-dependent transition-matrix elements for isolated tar-
get molecules, calculated according to the method presented in Ref. [50], are the starting
point for calculation of the formation rates in solid hydrogens. The transition-matrix ele-
ments are available for the rotational transitions Ki = 0, 1

Kf = 0, . . . , 9.

Resonant dtµ formation in D2 molecule is the most complicated case. The lowest res-
νf = 2 and diﬀerent ro-
onances, corresponding to the vibrational transition νi = 0
tational states Ki and Kf , are located in the vicinity of ε = 0 with the radius of a few
tens meV. The resonance energies in this energy region, for a free D2 molecule and for a D2
bound in a 3-K solid deuterium, are shown in Table I. In particular, there are several sub-

threshold resonances that give signiﬁcant contribution to the low-energy rates, because of
wide resonance proﬁles. The resonance-energy shift (39), for a deuterium target at 3 K, is
∆εif =
2.29 meV. Resonances in the upper spin state F = 1 have much smaller energies
than those for F = 0 with the same rotational quantum numbers. In particular, the largest
values of εif for F = 1, shown in Table I, are due to the excitations Ki = 0, 1

ddµ case, where low-energy formation is determined by the dipole transitions, with the ma-
trix elements slowly varying below a few tens meV [30, 50]. Another diﬀerence between
the ddµ and dtµ case is involved by larger separations of the neighboring dtµ resonances
corresponding to Ki = 0 and Ki = 1. Therefore, for dtµ one can expect more pronounced
diﬀerences between formation in solid ortho-D2 and para-D2 than those found in the ddµ

located at εif = 2.7 meV. The phonon terms in
Si are calculated assuming ΓS = 0, since in
this example we want to neglect their convolution with the Breit-Wigner proﬁle. There is
a strong contrast between resonant formation of the molecules dtµ and ddµ [30] in a solid
deuterium. In the dtµ case, the wide Breit-Wigner peak is not so much pronounced as the
2 raises by a few orders of
narrow recoil-less ddµ resonances. The matrix element
magnitude within the multiphonon distribution of 100 meV. Thus, the phonon contribution
to the dtµ formation rate is comparable with the nonphonon one, already above a few meV.
This means that a detailed form of the density Z(w) of vibrational lattice states is necessary
for accurate estimation of the low-energy dtµ-formation rate in a solid D2. A shape of
the phonon spectrum in the energy-dependent rate is strongly distorted, which one sees
in Fig. 8 calculated using the expansion (89).
Nevertheless, the one-phonon and two-
phonon terms are clearly distinguished in the curve corresponding to para-D2. The lowest
positive resonance in ortho-D2 is located at 10 meV. Thus, the Breit-Wigner peak is strongly
suppressed by the Debye-Waller factor and the rate is quite ﬂat. At ε
0, the rates are
determined by the wings of the Breit-Wigner peaks, because phonon contribution to the
rates vanishes when κ approaches zero.
In the case of tµ(F = 1) scattering, the main
resonances are far from the considered low-energy interval (see Table I). The rates shown
in Fig. 9 are thus determined by the Breit-Wigner wings of the deep subthreshold resonances
with contributions from the weak positive resonances (Kf = 5). Therefore, the formation
rates for F = 1 are lower by two orders of magnitude than those for F = 0.

Resonances in tµ scattering from D2, corresponding to the vibrational excitations νf ≥
3
of the [(dtµ)dee]complex, are located at higher energies ε & 0.2 eV. Therefore, they are well
described by the asymptotic form (77) which is independent of the phonon function Z(w).
As a result, the formation rate is determined accurately using the mean kinetic energy ET of

nD2 for several νf is plotted in Fig. 10. The highest peaks, which appear at about 0.5 eV,
correspond to νf = 3.

In Fig. 11, the dtµ-formation rates calculated for 3-K gaseous nD2 is compared with the
solid-target case. The energy-dependent rates for a perfect gas have been calculated assum-
ing a 3-K Maxwellian distribution of the D2 kinetic energy. They include only formation due
to two-body (tµ+D2) collisions. The formation rates for deuterium, presented in Figs. 10
and 11, display striking diﬀerence between the gas and solid case. At ε
0, the theory
developed for a perfect gas and two-body collisions gives a negligible resonant formation
rate. This result disagrees with the experiments performed both in liquid and gas [3] and
solid [18] targets. The rate for the solid shows strong contribution from the subthreshold
resonance, which leads to a large rate, in the limit ε
0. Solid-state eﬀects are also signif-
icant at higher energies. The resonance peaks in solid are much broader than those in the
gas because of the large eﬀective target temperature [49]. The widths of the peaks increase
with rising recoil energy. However, the centers of higher-energy peaks in the both targets
have the similar locations since, in the impulse-approximation limit, the recoil energy (72)

energy, between the solid and gas, is negligible for εif ≫
Calculation of the dtµ formation rate in a solid HD and DT is simpler than in the D2 case
as there are no signiﬁcant resonances in the vicinity of ε = 0 for molecules HD and DT. This
is caused by diﬀerent values of the rotational and vibrational quanta for the three molecules.
The molecule HD is the lightest one and the resonances connected with νf = 2 are situated
above 0.1 eV [14, 50]. Therefore, contributions from subsequent phonon processes to the
formation rate, plotted in Fig. 12, cannot be distinguished.
The resonance peak for
νf = 2 in HD is the strongest dtµ resonance in the three considered molecules. In Fig. 13,
a similar resonant-formation rate is shown for a 3-K solid DT target. The lowest peaks
for F = 0 and F = 1, which take the asymptotic form (77), correspond here to νf = 3.
The rotational and vibrational quanta are smallest for DT, so that the main (lowest Kf )
resonances connected with νf = 2 are located deeply below ε = 0. Thus, a contribution to
the formation rate from the subthreshold resonances is very small and is not apparent in
this ﬁgure. At 3 K, the eﬀective target temperature Teﬀ, determined by Eqs. (74) and (73),
equals about 41 K for HD and 50 K for DT. The resonance shift ∆εif , deﬁned by Eq. (39),

Calculation of the back-decay rates is performed assuming, as in the ddµ case, that the
rotational deexcitations are very fast, compared to the complex lifetime. Therefore, for
estimation of the back-decay rate, only Kf = 0 is taken into account. On the other hand,
according to very slow vibrational relaxation observed in solid H2 and D2, vibrational states
of the complex are assumed to be unchanged. For dtµ formation in solid D2, the back-decay
probability from the state νf = 0 equals zero, since the corresponding resonance energy
˜εif .
20 meV. Thus, back decay would require a gain of about 20 meV from lattice
vibrations, which is impossible at low target temperatures.

The dtµ resonances were directly observed at TRIUMF [19–22] using the energetic tµ-
atom beam and time-of-ﬂight techniques. However, for interpretation of these experiments,
a Monte Carlo simulation [52] was employed in order to compare the theoretical rates (such
as that shown in Fig. 11) with the data. This procedure was indispensable since the time-
of-ﬂight spectra cannot be uniquely inverted because of the geometry used and the energy
loss of tµ atoms in the reaction layer, prior to resonant formation of the muonic-molecular
complex. A detailed analysis of this eﬀect was performed by Fujiwara [19]. He found more
fusion events at short (. 2 µs) and large (& 4 µs) times. Much broader peaks that we

25

have calculated, which take into account large eﬀective temperature of the solid targets,
can improve the ﬁts to the data. The analysis of the fusion yield, performed in Ref. [19],
proved that the low-energy dtµ-formation rate in solid deuterium was much higher than that
predicted by the two-collision gas model. In particular, this concerns formation from the
state F = 1. The theoretical rates presented in Fig. 9 support this ﬁnding.

The two-peaked structure of the time spectra, predicted by the gas model, was not
conﬁrmed by the HD data [21]. Therefore, one may expect better agreement with the data
if the rate shown in Fig. 12 is used instead of more pronounced peaks calculated for a 3-K
HD gas. A possibility of wider resonance peaks with a constant Doppler width of 50 meV
was already considered in Ref. [21], which did not give better ﬁts to the data. However,
according to Eq. (71), the Doppler width in a condensed target increases with the rising
recoil energy ωR. Simultaneously, the peak height given by Eq. (77) decreases for higher ωR,
so that the resonance strength is preserved.

assumed, for the tritium isotopic concentration Ct = 0.4. The temperature values of 5 K
and 16 K are the two limiting temperatures of the RIKEN-RAL experiment, in which an
unexpected temperature dependence of µCF in solid D/T mixtures [18] was found. The
corresponding target density ϕ
1.5–1.4 (in units of the liquid hydrogen density equal
1022 atoms/cm3) is almost constant. A similar target, kept at 15 K, was also
to 4.25
used in the PSI experiment [4]. In the both experiments, time spectra of neutrons from dt
fusion were measured. The data were interpreted using the standard steady-state kinetics,
assuming that tµ atoms were thermalized. Formation from the state F = 1 is negligible
for an appreciable tritium concentration as the spin-ﬂip transition F = 1
0 in low-
energy tµ + t collision is very fast [53]. The theoretical rates, as functions of the incident
tµ energy, display a weak temperature dependence. One can expect such behavior of the
1 (ΘD denotes the Debye
rates since, for any solid-target temperature, the limit T /ΘD
temperature) is achieved and changes of ΘD are very small [27, 28]. For the considered target,
ΘD decreases by about 5% when the temperature is raised from T = 5 K to T = 16 K. Thus,
changes of the average formation rate, determined from steady-state conditions, can only be
ascribed to diﬀerent tµ-energy distributions corresponding to diﬀerent target temperatures.
An accurate comparison of the theory with data requires Monte Carlo simulations of µCF
in solid D/T mixture, which can be performed in future after completion of a full set of the
diﬀerential cross section for muonic atom scattering in mixed D/T crystals. The tµ-energy
distribution in steady-state conditions is a crucial information. A form of such distribution
is non-Maxwellian and the mean energy is greater than 3
2 kBT , due to solid-state eﬀects
and a possible admixture of epithermal tµ’s from the reaction dµ + t
tµ + d and from
back decay. The latter eﬀect has been studied with the use of Monte Carlo simulations
in Refs. [41, 54], in the case of gas and liquid targets. In a high-density target with medium
or high Ct, this eﬀect is small, which is conﬁrmed by the PSI ﬁts [4].

for T = 16 K. It is evident that the rise of the formation rate, above about 3 K, is mainly due
to tµ entering into the region of the recoil-less resonant peak in para-D2, centered at 2.7 meV.
Phonon processes in both ortho-D2 and para-D2 lead to a smaller rise of the rate. The
calculated formation rate is close to the PSI result for T = 13 K [4]. A coincidence of the
theoretical curve with the data is obtained, as in the case of the TRIUMF measurements [20],
on scaling by the factor Sλ < 1, which can be ascribed to inaccuracy of the calculated
transition-matrix elements. Here, we have Sλ = 0.86, which is consistent with the result
of Ref. [20].

In the RIKEN-RAL experiment [18], about 20% decrease of the cycling rate λc has
been observed when the target temperature was changed from 16 to 5 K, independently
of the tritium concentration. In order to explain this eﬀect, several hypotheses have been
considered. The hypothesis of a signiﬁcant change of the mean resonant dtµ formation
rate ˜λ0
dtµ (for F = 0) has led to best ﬁts to the data. Kawamura et al assume that the two
components of ˜λ0
dtµ, namely the rate ˜λ0,D2
dtµ of resonant formation on molecule D2 and the
for molecule DT, are comparable. At 16 K, they use ˜λ0,D2
similar rate ˜λ0,DT
108 s−1
dtµ = 3.5
dtµ
and ˜λ0,DT
108 s−1 [18]. All temperature dependence of ˜λ0

dtµ
(Cd is the deuterium isotopic concentration) is ascribed only to ˜λ0,D2
dtµ . Other rates in the
steady-state kinetics being ﬁxed, about 30% decrease of ˜λ0,D2
dtµ between 16 K and 5 K has been
obtained. Thus, for Ct = 0.4, the respective change of ˜λ0
dtµ equals about 25%. This ﬁnding
agrees quite well with analogous 20% decrease of the theoretical rate plotted in Fig. 16.
However, theory predicts that the low-energy rate ˜λ0,DT
should be smaller by a few orders
dtµ
of magnitude than the corresponding rate ˜λ0,D2
dtµ , since the strong resonances in tµ+DT
scattering are far from the region ε
0. Averaging the rate presented in Fig. 15 over the
tµ energy distribution gives ˜λ0,DT
106 s−1. This value agrees well with the rate
˜λ0,DT
106 s−1, determined for a 30-K liquid D/T in the PSI experiment [4].

Note that the formation rate in the solid is somewhat greater than the corresponding rate
in the liquid, which is a general law conﬁrmed by experiments. Thus, according to the
presented calculation and to the PSI results, ˜λ0
˜λ0,D2

state analysis of Ref. [18], a somewhat greater value of ˜λ0,D2
should have been assumed.

In fact, Monte Carlo simulations, similar to that performed in Ref. [41] for gaseous and
liquid D/T, are indispensable for an accurate analysis of such experiment since several rates
change signiﬁcantly at lowest energies and thermalization process in a solid hydrogens is
complicated [29, 30, 55]. It depends on the target temperature, isotopic concentration, and
rotational population. A set of the diﬀerential cross sections for muonic atom scattering in
mixed solid D/T is necessary for full µCF description in such a target.

V. CONCLUSIONS

A method of calculating the rates of muonic-molecule resonant formation in collision of
muonic atoms with condensed hydrogens has been developed. In the case of polycrystalline
hydrogen-isotope targets, detailed calculations have been performed using the Debye model
of the isotropic harmonic solid. The values of the resonant-formation rates have been com-
puted for resonant dtµ formation in frozen D/T and HD targets, up to the collision energy of
about 1 eV. These rates are very diﬀerent from those obtained for dilute gaseous hydrogens
and exhibit strong solid-state eﬀects.

energy limit (ε
0.1 eV), for any target, the rate takes a general asymptotic form which
depends on the mean kinetic energy of a target molecule. For low-pressure solid and liquid
hydrogens, this energy is much greater than the corresponding energy in a perfect gas. As
a result, condensed-matter eﬀects in resonant formation do not disappear even at highest
collision energies. Since the main dtµ resonances for HD and DT are located far from zero
energy, in these cases it is suﬃcient to use only the asymptotic expression for calculations.
The calculated resonance proﬁles in solid are much broader than in the dilute-gas case.
Experimental evidence supporting this conclusion has been found in the time-of-ﬂight mea-
surements of dtµ resonances at TRIUMF. A quantitative comparison of the theory with
these experiments requires however complicated Monte-Carlo simulations.

The mean values of the dtµ-formation rates for D2 bound in the solid D/T mixtures,
averaged over the tµ kinetic energy under the steady-state conditions, agree well with the
PSI and RIKEN-RAL data. Also the temperature dependence of the mean rate, determined
in the interval temperature interval of 5–16 K at RIKEN-RAL, is revealed by the theory.

Introduction

An atom moving across magnetic ﬁeld is equivalent to an atom placed in perpendicular
magnetic and electric ﬁelds. We consider the hydrogen atom moving in a magnetic ﬁeld
B, strong enough to signiﬁcantly squeeze the electron wavefunction. Quantitatively,
109 G) is assumed large. Here,
the parameter γ = ¯hωc/(2 Ryd) = B/(2.35
ωc = eB/mec is the electron cyclotron frequency, and Ryd = mee4/2¯h2 is the ground-
state energy of the ﬁeld-free atom.

×

Although only small values of γ are available in laboratory, large values are not
uncommon in astrophysics. Spectra of some white-dwarf stars have been interpreted
as produced by hydrogen at ﬁeld strengths between 106 G and 109 G (Wunner and
Ruder 1987, Fassbinder and Schweizer 1996, and references therein). Neutron stars
108 G, and
which are observed as radio pulsars reveal ﬁeld strengths in excess of 2
over half of them possess magnetic ﬁelds from 1012 G to 2
1013 G (Taylor et al
1993). Absorption of radiation by strongly magnetized atomic hydrogen may have
large eﬀects on ultraviolet and X-ray spectra of the neutron stars, which are measured
with modern space telescopes (Pavlov et al 1995).

×

×

The physics of solid state presents another important ﬁeld of application of
quantum-mechanical calculations of strongly magnetized hydrogen atoms. Excitons
and shallow impurities in semiconductors reveal hydrogen-like spectra with scaled
values of ωc and Ryd. Such scaling oﬀers a possibility to reach the regime γ > 1 in an
experiment (e.g., Elliott and Loudon 1960, Klaassen et al 1997).

The non-moving hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic ﬁeld was thoroughly studied
in the past two decades (Ruder et al 1994, and references therein). Extensive tables
of binding energies have been presented by R¨osner et al (1984) and supplemented by
Wintgen and Friedrich (1986), Ivanov (1988), Xi et al (1992) and Kravchenko et al
(1996). Tables of oscillator strengths at various values of γ have been published by
Forster et al (1984); analytical ﬁts to photoionization cross sections at γ
1 have
been proposed by Potekhin and Pavlov (1993).

≫

The problem of a moving atom (or an atom in crossed ﬁelds) is much more
complicated because of the absence of the axial symmetry. Much work has been
done at low ﬁeld strengths (e.g., Melezhik 1993), where the second-order perturbation
theory was applicable (e.g., Braun and Solov’ev 1984, and references therein). The
simplifying approximation of inﬁnite proton mass, exploited in this regime, breaks
down in strong ﬁelds because of collective motion eﬀects studied in detail by Avron
et al (1978), Baye and Vincke (1990) and Dippel et al (1994).
In particular, so-
called decentred states (with the electron localized mostly in the “magnetic well”
aside from the Coulomb centre) are likely to be populated. These exotic states have
been predicted by Burkova et al (1976) and studied by Ipatova et al (1984), Baye et al
(1992), Dzyaloshinskii (1992) and Schmelcher (1993). As well as the usual “centred”
states, the decentred states have an inﬁnite discrete energy spectrum (Potekhin 1994,
hereafter Paper I). Collective-motion eﬀects on the centred states of the strongly
magnetized hydrogen atom have been considered by Vincke and Baye (1988) and
Pavlov and M´esz´aros (1993) in frames of the theory of perturbation.

Completely non-perturbative results, covering both centred and decentred states
as well as the transition region, were ﬁrst presented by Vincke et al (1992) for binding
energies and wavefunctions. In Paper I, additionally, oscillator strengths have been
considered. Pavlov and Potekhin (1995, hereafter Paper II) studied spectral line
shapes, and Potekhin and Pavlov (1997) calculated photoionization cross sections.

None of these numerical results, however, has been published in an easy-to-use form of
tables or analytical expressions. This paper provides such expressions for the magnetic
104. This range is physically
ﬁeld strengths typical of neutron stars, 300
distinguished, since at weaker ﬁelds the transition region is strongly complicated by
multiple narrow anticrossings (Vincke et al 1992). The relative simplicity of the
104,
spectrum at γ >
corresponds to the onset of non-negligible relativistic eﬀects (Chen and Goldman
1992).

In the next section we recall the basic deﬁnitions and physical properties of a
hydrogen atom arbitrarily moving in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. In Section 3, we ﬁrst
present accurate analytical ﬁts to binding energies, depending on the state of motion,
for a number of bound states and various ﬁeld strengths. Then we derive analytical
approximations continuously depending on γ. As a by-product, simple and accurate
approximations are obtained for binding energies of the non-moving atom at any γ >
∼ 1.
The obtained formulae are applied to evaluation of the maximum transverse velocity
of the strongly magnetized atom. Section 4 is devoted to analytical approximations
of quantum-mechanical sizes and main oscillator strengths of the atom. In section 5,
an example of using the obtained expressions for calculation of absorption coeﬃcients
of strongly magnetized, hot hydrogen plasma is presented.

2. Centred and decentred states: general description

Motion of the hydrogen atom in a magnetic ﬁeld can be conveniently described by the
pseudomomentum (e.g., Johnson et al 1983)

where the subscript i =e or i =p indicates electron or proton, respectively,

is the velocity operator, mi the mass, qp =
potential of the ﬁeld, and Htot the two-particle Hamiltonian operator. Gorkov
and Dzyaloshinskii (1968) have shown that in the representation in which all three
components of K have deﬁnite values the pseudoseparation of the centre-of-mass
motion can be performed, that is, the relative motion can be described in terms of a
one-particle Hamiltonian which depends on K. The expectation value of the velocity

It is convenient to describe the centred states of the atom using the relative
coordinate r(0) = re −

potential, A(r) = 1
r. For the decentred states, the “shifted” representation

Let us assume that B is directed along the z-axis. The z-component of the
pseudomomentum corresponding to the motion along the ﬁeld separates exactly from
the Hamiltonian, giving the kinetic term K 2
z /2mH, while the transverse components
K⊥ produce non-trivial eﬀects. Therefore we assume Kz = 0 and K ⊥ = K hereafter.

If there were no Coulomb attraction, then the electron Landau number n =
0, 1, 2, . . . and the z-projection s of the angular momentum of the relative motion
would be exact quantum numbers (since K is deﬁnite, the electron and proton do not
possess deﬁnite z-projections of the angular momenta separately from each other —
see Johnson et al 1983). In this case the transverse part of the wavefunction could be
described by a Landau function Φns(r(1)
⊥ is the projection of r(1) in the
(xy)-plane and s is deﬁned in the shifted reference frame (e.g., Paper I). The energy
of the transverse excitation (with the zero-point and spin terms subtracted) is

1976) corresponds to retaining only one term in this expansion.

below 1 Ryd. For a moving atom, this way of numbering remains unambiguous at

Since the transverse factors Φns in (4) are known analytically, only the one-
dimensional longitudinal functions g(η)

which is most eﬃcient at γ
1 has been described in Paper I. At small
pseudomomenta K, the states ν = 0 remain tightly bound and centred, the average
electron-proton displacement ¯x being considerably smaller than rc. For the hydrogen-
like states ν

1, however, ¯x is close to rc at any K.

The larger K, the greater is the distortion of the wavefunction towards rc,
caused by the motion-induced electric ﬁeld in the co-moving reference frame. The
perturbation approximation becomes increasingly inaccurate, until near some critical
value Kc a transition to the decentred state occurs, and the character of the motion
totally changes. With further increasing K, the transverse velocity decreases and

i

tends to zero, while the electron-proton separation increases and tends to rc. Thus, for
the decentred states, the pseudomomentum characterizes electron-proton separation
rather than velocity.

The shifted (η = 1) adiabatic approximation becomes fairly good at K

Kc.
At very large K the longitudinal functions become oscillator-like, corresponding to a

ﬁxed ν, this limit is reached at K
at arbitrarily large K there remain inﬁnite number of bound states with high values
of ν whose longitudinal wavefunctions are goverened by the Coulomb tail rather than
by the parabolic core of the eﬀective one-dimentional potential (Paper I).

decentred states may be signiﬁcantly populated (Paper II). This necessitates inclusion
of the entire range of K below and above Kc in the consideration.

3. Binding energies

3.1. Dependence of the energies on the pseudomomentum at selected ﬁeld strengths

We have calculated binding energies of the hydrogen atom moving across the strong
magnetic ﬁeld at γ = 300, 600, 1000, 2000, 3000 and 10 000 for several lowest tightly-
bound and hydrogen-like states, using the technique described in Paper I. At each
value of γ and for each state, the calculations have been performed at K = 0 and at
104 au, approximately equidistant
about 50–100 values of K from K
10 au to K
in log K but with additional points near avoided crossings. The calculated energies
have accuracy of 3–5 digits.

≥

≤

In applications, however, one usually has to deal with a distribution of atoms over
more or less broad band of values of the pseudomomentum K, and to calculate the
observable quantities by averaging over K. This makes it highly desirable to have an
analytical approximation of the K-dependence of the energies, E(K). Lai and Salpeter
(1995) were the ﬁrst to present an analytical ﬁt to E(K), which was rather accurate
for the ground state at K < Kc but could not be applied to excited or decentred
states.

We describe the longitudinal energy (5) by the formula

(6)

The two-term structure of (6) is dictated by the necessity to describe the two physically
distinct regions of K below and above Kc. The parameter α has the meaning of the
width of the transition region near Kc in logarithmic scale of pseudomomenta. As
noted in Paper I, for the tightly-bound states Kc is close to (2mHE(0)

In the considered range of γ, the parameter q1 can be approximated as

q1 =

Optimal values of the other parameters are listed in table 1. The last column presents
the root-mean-square (rms) diﬀerence σE between the computed and ﬁtted energies.
Maxmum errors of the ﬁt ( <

∼ 3σE) occur near the avoided crossings.

Binding energies of the hydrogen-like states are approximated by the same formula

(6) but with slightly diﬀerent expressions for E(1) and E(2). For these states, M ⊥
nsν
exceeds mH by orders of magnitude, and the perturbation method fails already at
small values of K (Pavlov and M´esz´aros 1993), which renders the notion of transverse
mass practically useless for the ﬁtting. Thus we consider meﬀ as eﬀectively inﬁnite
and put E(1)
1). Furthermore, the transition region is not well deﬁned,
and therefore Kc and α lose their clear meaning and become mere ﬁtting parameters.

Optimal values of the parameters q0 and α are listed in table 2. As well as in table 1,
the last column presents rms errors which are several times smaller than the maximum
errors near anticrossings.

In both tables 1 and 2, only truly bound (not autoionizing) states are considered.
For example, all states with s > 0, ν > 0 belong to continuum at γ > 673, therefore
table 2 does not contain entries for them at γ = 1000 and higher.

3.2. Two-dimensional approximations

Equations (6)–(9) help us to derive approximations of the binding energies as functions
of two continuous arguments γ and K. For this purpose, we replace the numerical
parameters listed in tables 1 and 2 by analytical functions of γ.

One of these parameters — the longitudinal energy of the atom at rest E(0) —
has an independent signiﬁcance. For this reason, we have constructed an accurate ﬁt
to E(0) in a possibly widest range of γ values. For the tightly-bound states, we have

their advantage is that they may be used at arbitrary γ in the range considered. In

4. Geometrical characteristics and radiative transitions

4.1. Atomic sizes and dipole moments

Geometrical characteristics of an atom play an important role in distribution of
atoms over quantum states in a plasma and in their contribution to the plasma
absorption coeﬃcients, since a “size” of an atom may be used to approximately
evaluate eﬀects of destruction of atoms caused by random charge distribution in the
plasma (e.g., Potekhin 1996). The K-dependence of rms sizes is complicated and can
be non-monotonous near anticrossings. However, the sizes usually need not be known
with high precision, that relieves the problem of ﬁtting. The accuracy level of the
approximations presented in this section is typically several percent.

At K = 0, the atom is axially symmetric, and its rms sizes along the Cartesian

coordinates can be approximated as lx0 = ly0 ≈

The radiative transitions forbidden for the atom at rest because of the
conservation of the angular-momentum projection become allowed for the moving
atom. In particular, the moving ground-state atom can absorb left-polarized radiaton.
Oscillator strengths of such transitions are signiﬁcant only at K of the order of
102 au. Therefore we derive for them ﬁtting formulae accurate to
10%

in this range of K and do not attempt to ﬁt the complicated behaviour they show
outside this range, where they are orders of magnitude smaller (Paper I).

In order to take into account induced emission, σi(ω) should be multiplied by
e−¯hω/kBT ). The collisional broadening can be taken into account by convolution
(1
of σi(ω) with the Lorentzian proﬁle characterized by the width Γ(Ki(ω)) (Paper II).
Since this type of broadening has only marginal signiﬁcance compared to the magnetic
broadening in the neutron star atmospheres, we employ a simple order-of-magnitude
estimate:

Some of the typical absorption proﬁles obtained numerically in Paper II are
represented by full lines in ﬁgure 3. The spectral range is shown that is relevant
to interpretation of spectral observations of neutron stars with the X-ray telescope
on-board ROSAT satellite (e.g., Pavlov et al 1995). Approximate proﬁles, obtained
using the analytical approximations of section 3.2 for E(K), the formulae of section 4
for l(K) and f (K), and the estimate (28) for Γ(K), are shown in ﬁgure 3 by broken
lines. One can see that they correctly reproduce gross features of the spectral shapes,
and thus the proposed approximations are suitable for using them in theoretical models
of neutron-star atmospheres compatible with contemporary observational data. The
ﬁgure demonstrates also the importance of the decentred states:
for example, the
absorption of longitudinally polarized radiation at ¯hω < 100 eV is produced solely by
the states of motion with K > Kc.

In reality, observed spectra are inﬂuenced not only by the bound-bound
photoabsorption shown in ﬁgure 3 but also by bound-free transitions. For moving
atoms, bound-free cross sections were calculated by Potekhin and Pavlov (1997).
Under conditions typical of atmospheres of cooling neutron stars, maximum bound-free
photoabsorption turns out to be of the same order of magnitude as the bound-bound
one, but it is shifted to higher photon energies. In the spectral range shown in ﬁgure
3, the bound-free transitions are generally less important.

6. Conclusions

/

E

E

/V m−1) (B/G)−1.

We have obtained analytical approximations of binding energies, geometrical sizes
and main oscillator strengths of radiative transitions of the hydrogen atom moving
across a strong magnetic ﬁeld. These approximations can be also applied to the
hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds, since the latter problem reduces
to the former one with the eﬀective pseudomomentum K = mHc
Ec, or equivalently
K [au] = 8.4 (
Binding energies are the most important quantities in many applications, and
for that reason we have presented not only ﬁtting formulae analytically depending
on γ and K (section 3.2), but also considerably more accurate K-dependences at 6
selected values of γ (section 3.1). Atomic sizes (section 4.1) play important role in
distribution of atoms over quantum states in a plasma and in their contribution to
the plasma absorption coeﬃcients. For example, a size of an atom may be used to
evaluate eﬀects of “unbinding” of electrons caused by random charge distribution in
the plasma. For non-magnetized hydrogen plasmas, an approximate treatment of these
eﬀects was revised recently (Potekhin 1996); for the strong magnetic ﬁelds analogous
work is under way. The approximations of oscillator strengths (section 4.2), along
with those of the energies and sizes, facilitate calculations of absorption spectra of
strongly magnetized, partially ionized hydrogen plasmas. Eventually, the analytical
estimates of γ- and K-dependences of the binding energies, atomic sizes and transition
rates will help to generalize previously developed models of fully ionized atmospheres
of magnetic neutron stars (Shibanov et al 1992) to the more realistic case of partially

Figure 3. Comparison of numerically calculated (——) and approximate (– – –)
spectral shapes for bound-bound absorption of right (+), left (−) and longitudinally
(k) polarized radiation by hydrogen atoms in thermal equilibrium with plasma under
the conditions typical for atmospheres of magnetic neutron stars: kBT = 1 Ryd
(T = 1.58 × 105 K), ρ = 0.01 g cm−3, and γ = 103 (B = 2.35 × 1012 G).

This work was inspired by stimulating discussions with participants of the 172 WE-
Heraeus-Seminar on Atoms and Molecules in Strong External Fields (Bad Honnef,
7–11 April 1997), organized by Dr. Peter Schmelcher and Dr. Wolfgang Schweizer. I
wish to express my gratitude to Prof. Joachim Tr¨umper and Dr. Vyacheslav Zavlin for
hospitality during my visit at the Max-Planck-Institut f¨ur Extraterrestrische Physik
in Garching, where a large part of this work has been performed using the MPE
computing facilities. The visit was made possible due to the DFG–RFBR grant No. 96-
02-00177G. Partial support from the RFBR grant No. 96–02–16870a and INTAS grant
No. 94-3834 is also acknowledged. I am grateful to Prof. Joseph Ventura for useful
discussions and hospitality at the University of Crete, where the ﬁnal part of this
work was completed.

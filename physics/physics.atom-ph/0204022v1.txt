Abstract

We study the properties of a Rb magneto-optic trap loaded from a commercial

getter source which provides a large ﬂux of atoms for the trap along with the

capability of rapid turn-oﬀ necessary for obtaining long trap lifetimes. We

have studied the trap loading at two diﬀerent values of background pressure

to determine the cross-section for Rb–N2 collisions to be 3.5(4) × 10−14 cm2

and that for Rb–Rb collisions to be of order 3 × 10−13 cm2. At a background

pressure of 1.3 × 10−9 torr, we load more than 108 atoms into the trap with a

time constant of 3.3 s. The 1/e lifetime of trapped atoms is 13 s limited only

by background collisions.

Laser cooling and trapping has now become a standard technique for atomic physics

experiments whenever a cold dense sample of atoms is required. The workhorse in this ﬁeld

is the magneto-optic trap (MOT) [1]. For instance, a MOT is the starting point for laser

cooling experiments involving Bose-Einstein condensation, cold collisions, optical lattices,

precision spectroscopy, atomic fountain clocks, etc [2]. The source of atoms for the MOT is

typically an oven inside the vacuum chamber containing a small amount of pure metal. The

MOT is loaded in one of two ways: from a thermal beam slowed by a counter-propagating

laser beam (Zeeman-slower or chirp slower), or from the slow atom tail of hot background

vapor (so called vapor cell traps). In both cases, the atom density has to be quite high for

the MOT to be loaded with a large number of atoms in a short time. But the high density

usually limits the lifetime of the trap due to collisions with untrapped atoms unless the

source can be turned oﬀ rapidly. This problem is solved in traps loaded with slowed atomic

beams by using shutters to block the beam. In vapor cell traps, one solution is to use a

double MOT, where the atoms are ﬁrst loaded into a MOT located in a region of high vapor

pressure, and then transferred through a diﬀerentially pumped line to a MOT in a region

with much better vacuum where the lifetime is several orders of magnitude higher.

To address the same problem, we have been studying the loading of a MOT for Rb atoms

from a commercial getter source [3]. Rb getter sources release atomic Rb when resistively

heated with a few A of current. They are inexpensive, easy to handle inside ultra-high

vacuum (UHV) systems, and have the advantage that the supply of atoms can be rapidly

switched oﬀ by turning down the heating current below a threshold value. Such sources

have only recently started being used in laser cooling experiments [4,5].

In Ref. 5, fast

loading of a Rb MOT was achieved by placing the source within 30 mm of the trap center

and operating it in a pulsed mode. By contrast, our source is placed about 90 mm away

from the trap center and is operated continuously. We use the source as a thermal source

much like the background vapor in vapor cell traps, but with the capability of rapid turn-

oﬀ. Even though the stainless steel boat holding the source rises to a few hundred degrees

C during operation, there are enough atoms within the velocity capture range of the laser

2

cooling beams to load the MOT with more than 108 atoms in a few seconds. To characterize

the collisional loss mechanisms operating during the loading process, we have studied the

properties of the MOT at diﬀerent source currents and background pressures. From this, we

extract the cross-section for Rb–N2 and Rb–Rb collisions. In addition, we have measured

the steady state trap population as a function of laser detuning and magnetic ﬁeld gradient

since optimal values of these parameters depend on the velocity distribution of Rb atoms

emanating from the source. These results indicate that getter sources are compatible with

fast loading of a large number of atoms into the MOT, along with a long trap lifetime after

turn-oﬀ.

I. GETTER SOURCE DETAILS

The getter source is a commercially available dispenser of alkali atoms designed for

industrial applications. The source we use contains a Rb compound and a reducing agent

enclosed in a stainless steel boat. The compound is stable at room temperature and the

boat can be handled easily without fear of contamination. When a few A of current is

passed through the boat, its temperature rises to several hundred degrees C. At these high

temperatures, the Rb compound undergoes a reduction reaction and atomic Rb is released.

Since the reaction is a threshold process, no Rb vapor is released below a threshold value of

current, typically about 2.7 A.

We have installed the source in our vacuum system by attaching it to a UHV feedthrough

using Cu-Be screw-type connectors. We have also tried spot welding the source to the

feedthrough leads to reduce contact resistance, and ﬁnd no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in its per-

formance. We prefer the screw-type connectors since this makes replacement of the source

easier. Once inside the vacuum system, it is important to degas the source very well because

this limits the ultimate base pressure in the chamber. We therefore operate the source at

a current just below threshold for several hours during the initial bakeout of the system.

When we ﬁrst start using the source after bakeout, we ﬁnd that no Rb is released even up

3

to a current of 5 A. To get it started, we need to raise the current to about 8 A for a short

duration of 2–5 s. After several such high current pulses, the source becomes very repro-

ducible and has a well deﬁned threshold current of 2.7 A. We speculate that these pulses

are essential to get rid of a surface crust that forms during storage and bakeout.

We have probed the Rb vapor density inside the vacuum system at diﬀerent source cur-

rents using near-resonant laser light. Above the threshold current of 2.7 A, the ﬂuorescence

signal from the vapor increases rapidly with source current. At a current of 4 A, the vapor

becomes optically dense. Around 4.5 A, the boat starts to glow red indicating a temperature

near 600oC. Above 8 A, so much Rb is released that the walls of the chamber get a metallic

coating visible to the naked eye. We therefore load the MOT at source currents in the range

of 3.0 to 3.8 A, which gives us an adequate ﬂux of atoms without overloading the vacuum

system. The fast turn-oﬀ capability of the source is seen in Fig. 1, where we plot the decay

of the background ﬂuorescence after the current is turned oﬀ. The 1/e time constant is only

about 3 s and is independent of source current in the wide range of 3 to 4 A. This indicates

that the cooling of the source is very rapid and the time constant is probably limited by the

pumping speed near the trapping region.

We ﬁnd the source to be very robust. There is no noticeable change in the Rb ﬂux at a

given current even after a year of regular use. Though the supplier speciﬁes a “use before”

date of one year from the date of manufacture, we have installed it in our system even after

three years without any problems. Contrary to what is reported in Ref. 5, the source does

not appear to undergo “irreversible contamination” if the pressure rises by several orders

of magnitude during initial degassing. Perhaps what they call irreversible contamination

is similar to our observation that Rb atoms are not released even at currents of 5 A when

the source is operated the ﬁrst few times after bakeout. But, as mentioned earlier, this can

be reversed by applying high current pulses to evaporate any surface layer that might have

formed.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The experiments are done in a vacuum chamber consisting of a 100 mm O.D. stainless

steel tube with ten intersecting 38 mm O.D. ports, as shown schematically in Fig. 2. Nine

of the ten ports have commercial glass viewports for optical access, and one port holds the

feedthrough for the getter source. The source is located about 90 mm from the center of

the MOT. The chamber is pumped by a 300 ℓ/s ion pump through a 100 mm O.D. port.

The ion pump has a liquid nitrogen cooled cryo-panel to get better base pressure. Under

normal conditions, the pressure inside the chamber is about 1 × 10−8 torr, which goes down

to about 1 × 10−9 torr with the cryo-panel cooled to 77 K.

The MOT laser beams are derived from two home-built grating feedback stabilized diode

lasers operating at 780 nm. The ﬁrst laser is the cooling laser which is locked near the

5S1/2, F = 2 → 5P3/2, F ′ = 3 cycling transition in 87Rb using saturated absorption spec-

troscopy in a room temperature vapor cell. The error signal is obtained by passing the laser

beam through an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) and dithering the frequency shift in the

AOM. The center frequency of the AOM is used to get variable detunings in the range of

−0.5Γ to −4Γ, where Γ = 2π × 6.1 MHz is the natural linewidth of the transition. Each

of the three beams for the MOT is circularly polarized with a power of around 4 mW and

a 1/e2 radius of 9 mm. The hyperﬁne repumping beam is derived from a second stabilized

diode laser which is locked to the 5S1/2, F = 1 → 5P3/2, F ′ = 2 transition in a vapor cell.

The error signal for this laser is obtained by modulating the diode injection current. The

resulting variation of a few MHz in the repumping frequency is inconsequential for operation

of the MOT. About 2 mW/cm2 of repumping light is mixed with the cooling beams in a

polarizing beamsplitter cube. The six laser beams intersect over a volume of 3 cm3. A

spherical quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld is superposed on the intersection region using a pair of

anti-Helmholtz coils (10 cm dia, 60 turns each) placed 10 cm apart. The ﬁeld gradient at

the center can be varied from 5 to 17 G/cm by varying the current through the coils in the

range of 2 to 7 A.

The ﬂuorescence from the trapped cloud of atoms is imaged on to both a CCD camera

for viewing, and a calibrated silicon photodiode for quantitative measurements. To estimate

the number of trapped atoms N, we ﬁt the total optical power P at the photodiode to the

following expression:

where Ω is the solid angle subtended by the detector at the cloud and γsc is the photon

scattering rate given by:

with I the total beam intensity from the six trapping beams, I0 the saturation intensity for

the transition (1.6 mW/cm2), and ∆ the detuning.

III. RESULTS

We have studied the loading characteristics of the MOT by measuring the trap ﬂuores-

cence as a function of time after the laser beams are turned on. The source is turned on a

few minutes before the light beams so that the ﬂux of Rb atoms reaches a steady state. The

loading of atoms into the trap is determined by a balance between the capture rate and the

loss rate. This results in the following rate equation:

where N is the number of atoms in the trap, R is the rate at which atoms are captured

from the background vapor, and τ is the loading time constant determined by losses due

to collisions [6]. The loss rate depends both on collisions with background atoms as well

collisions with hot, untrapped Rb atoms:

(3)

where n is the density of scattering particles, σ is the collisional scattering cross section

and ¯v is the average velocity. The subscript indicates whether the scattering is from the

background (b) or from the Rb source. The solution to Eq. 3 is an exponential growth in

the number of trapped atoms:

N = Ns[1 − exp(−t/τ )]

(5)

with a steady state value of Ns = Rτ . Since the trap ﬂuorescence is directly related to

the number of trapped atoms (from Eq. 1), the photodetector signal after the laser beams

are turned on is of the above form. The trap lifetime τd after the source is shut oﬀ is

determined solely by losses due to collisions with non-Rb background atoms. Therefore, the

photodetector signal after the source is turned oﬀ shows an exponential decay with a time

constant independent of the steady state population. A typical trap loading and decay curve

taken at a source current of 3.8 A is shown in Fig. 3.

To estimate the values of σb and σRb in Eq. 4, we have studied the trap loading and

decay properties at diﬀerent source currents and two values of background pressure, namely

1.5 × 10−8 torr and 1.3 × 10−9 torr. The results are listed in Table I. Several features

of the data are to be noted. First of all, at the higher pressure the loading time τ is 1 s

independent of the source current, indicating that background gas collisions dominate the

loss rate. Next, at the lower pressure, τ goes down from 4.6 s at 3.0 A to 3.3 s at 3.8 A as

the ﬂux of atoms from the source increases. The steady state trap population Ns increases

correspondingly from 1.1 × 107 to 1.1 × 108. Finally, the trap lifetime τd is independent of

source current (and Ns) at both values of pressure. This is consistent with the fact that the

lifetime depends only on background gas collisions. However, at the higher pressure, one

would expect that background collisions would limit the lifetime to a value around 1 s in

order to be consistent with the background limited loading time of 1 s, but the measured

value is actually 5.5 s. This diﬀerence arises because the source has a decay constant of 3 s

after turn-oﬀ (see Fig. 1) and the trap continues to be loaded even after the source is oﬀ. At

lower pressure, the measured lifetime of the trap is 13.3 s; here the 3 s decay of the source

7

can be neglected and the turn oﬀ can be assumed to be instantaneous.

We use the values of τ for diﬀerent pressures at the same source current to eliminate

the eﬀect of the Rb term in Eq. 4 and obtain the cross section for background gas collisions

from the following expression:

1
(τ )h

−

1
(τ )l

= [(nb)h − (nb)l] σb¯vb

(6)

where the subscripts h and l indicate higher and lower pressure respectively. Assuming the

background is predominantly nitrogen, which seems reasonable given the considerable drop

in pressure when the cryo-panel is cooled to 77 K, we can calculate the values of nb and ¯vb

at room temperature for a given pressure. The above equation then yields the value of σb.

The average value of σb obtained from the values of τ at source currents of 3.0 A and 3.3

A is 3.5(4) × 10−14 cm2. We can also obtain the value of σb from the 13.3 s trap lifetime

at lower pressure assuming that the loss is solely due to background gas collisions. This

yields a value of 3.8 × 10−14 cm2, consistent with the above result. These values are also

comparable to the cross section of 3.3 × 10−14 cm2 for Na–N2 collisions reported in Ref. 7.

Using the above value of σb, we obtain the value of σRb in the following manner. We

ﬁrst calculate the capture rate R by assuming, for simplicity, that all atoms entering the

trap volume with a velocity less than a critical velocity vc are slowed by the laser beams and

captured. If we further assume that the background vapor has a thermal distribution, the

number of such atoms per unit time can be calculated from kinetic theory [6], which yields:

R =

2
π2 nRbA

v4
c
¯v3
Rb

(7)

where A is the surface area of the trapping region determined by the overlap of the laser

beams (10 cm2 in our trap). From a one-dimensional laser cooling model, vc is the velocity

at which the Doppler shift takes the atom out of resonance by one linewidth, therefore it is

given by (|∆| + Γ)λ/2π, about 14 m/s for a typical detuning of −2Γ. Using Eq. 4 for τ , and

Eq. 7 for R, we obtain:

σRb =

Ns (cid:18)

¯vRb (cid:19)

[1 − τ (nbσb¯vb)]

(8)

which can be used to calculate σRb if ¯vRb is known. Assuming a value of 355 m/s for ¯vRb

(corresponding to a temperature of 250oC), we determine a value of 3 × 10−13 cm2 for σRb

from the data at 3.0 A. This value compares well with the following theoretical estimate

for the scattering cross section which assumes that the dominant scattering mechanism is

resonant dipole-dipole scattering [8]:

σRb = π

2/3

4C3
mRbvesc¯vRb (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(9)

where C3 = 5.8 × 10−48 Jm3 for Rb. Using vc = 14 m/s for vesc and 355 m/s for ¯vRb yields
a value of 3.2 × 10−13 cm2 for σRb. Therefore, our assumption that the temperature of

the vapor is around 250oC seems reasonable. At higher currents of 3.3 A and 3.8 A, the

measured values of τ lead to smaller estimates of σRb. This is probably because nonlinear

loss terms [9] become important at high atom densities and Eq. 3 is no longer valid. It is

diﬃcult to extract better estimates of the Rb–Rb cross section without a more complete

knowledge of the distribution of atoms coming out of the source at diﬀerent currents.

The velocity distribution of atoms emanating from the source is also important in deter-

mining optimal values of detuning and magnetic ﬁeld gradient for the MOT. This is because

the detuning determines the capture velocity, and, as we will see below, the ﬁeld gradient

determines the eﬀective slowing distance. We have therefore studied the steady state trap

population Ns as a function of these parameters. The dependence on detuning is shown in

Fig. 4. The number of trapped atoms is maximized at a detuning of −2.5Γ for a ﬁeld gra-

dient of 10 G/cm. The dependence can be understood from the following physical picture.

At low values of detuning, the critical velocity vc for slowing is small, and fewer atoms are

captured since R varies as v4

c (see Eq. 7): for example, when ∆ = −Γ, vc is only 9.5 m/s.

At high values of detuning, even though vc increases, the slowing distance also increases and

atoms are not slowed within the 9 mm size of the laser beams. Thus, when ∆ = −4Γ, vc

increases to 24 m/s but the slowing distance is about 11 mm. The optimal value of detuning

that we measure is similar to what is observed in a MOT loaded from room temperature

vapor [10].

9

The dependence of Ns on the magnetic ﬁeld gradient for a ﬁxed detuning is shown in

Fig. 5. The trap population is again maximized at an optimum value of ﬁeld gradient.

The trend can be understood as follows. At low values of the ﬁeld gradient, the trap is

shallow and atoms leave the trap easily. At high values of the gradient, the Zeeman shift,

which increases rapidly away from the trap center, makes laser cooling ineﬀective because

it changes the eﬀective detuning to a smaller value that is less optimal for cooling. For

example, the Zeeman shift for F = 2 → F ′ = 3 transitions driven by circularly polarized

light is 1.4 MHz/G. If the detuning is −2Γ and the ﬁeld gradient is 17 G/cm, the atoms

become resonant with the laser at a distance of 5 mm from the trap center and atoms are

not cooled beyond this point. The optimal value of ﬁeld gradient we measure is comparable

to values obtained in vapor cell MOTs [10]. The consistency of optimal values of detuning

and ﬁeld gradient with results from vapor cell traps indicate that the velocity distribution

emanating from the source is thermal.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have demonstrated that a MOT can be loaded eﬃciently from a getter source. The

source combines the advantages of providing a large ﬂux of atoms that can be captured

by the MOT with a fast turn-oﬀ necessary for getting a long trap lifetime. The loading

rate is determined both by collisions with background atoms and hot untrapped Rb atoms.

We have estimated the cross section for Rb–N2 and Rb–Rb collisions by measuring the

trap properties at two values of background pressure. The value of σb is 3.5(4) × 10−14 cm2,

comparable to a value reported for Na–N2 collisions, and the value of σRb is of order 3×10−13

cm2 consistent with a theoretical estimate based on resonant dipole-dipole scattering. At

a pressure of 1.3 × 10−9 torr, we load more than 108 atoms into the MOT with a time

constant of 3.3 s. At a background pressure of 1.5 × 10−8 torr, the loading time constant

is 1 s independent of the source current, indicating that collisions with the background are

dominant. We have also measured optimal values of detuning and magnetic ﬁeld gradient

10

which maximize the trap population. These values are consistent with observations in vapor

cell MOTs, indicating that the velocity distribution of Rb atoms from the source is thermal.

The trap lifetime at a pressure of 1.3×10−9 torr is 13 s and is limited only by the background

pressure since the supply of Rb atoms stops almost instantaneously. We are in the process

of changing over to a new vacuum system with a Ti-sublimation pump that should give us

base pressure in the range of 10−11 torr where we estimate that the trap lifetime will be a

few minutes.

trap.

FIG. 3. Loading and decay of the MOT. The plot shows a typical measurement of the trap

ﬂuorescence as a function of time. The photodetector signal is proportional to the number of

trapped atoms. The trapping beams are turned on at t = 0, after which the signal shows an

exponential growth with a time constant of about 4 s (see Eq. 5 in the text). The signal decays

exponentially after the source is turned oﬀ with a 1/e lifetime of about 13 s. The data were taken

with a source current of 3.8 A.

FIG. 4. Ns vs detuning. The plot shows the steady state number of trapped atoms as a

function of detuning for a constant magnetic ﬁeld gradient of 10 G/cm. The number is sharply

peaked at a detuning near −2.5Γ. The error bars represent statistical errors and do not include

systematic errors in scaling the photodetector signal to number of atoms. Such systematic errors,

however, will not aﬀect the observed trend.

FIG. 5. Ns vs magnetic ﬁeld gradient. The plot shows the steady state number of trapped

atoms as a function of axial ﬁeld gradient for a ﬁxed detuning of −2Γ. The number shows a broad

maximum at values of dB/dz around 12 G/cm. The error bars again represent only statistical

errors, but as for Fig. 4, systematic errors are not important for the trend.

We demonstrate how to realize an optical clock with neutral atoms that is competitive to the
currently best single ion optical clocks in accuracy and superior in stability. Using ultracold atoms
in a Ca optical frequency standard we show how to reduce the relative uncertainty to below 10−15.
We observed atom interferences for stabilization of the laser to the clock transition with a visibility
of 0.36, which is 70% of the ultimate limit achievable with atoms at rest. A novel scheme was
applied to detect these atom interferences with the prospect to reach the quantum projection noise
limit at an exceptional low instability of 4 × 10

−17 in 1 s.

Progress of science and technology has been closely
connected to the development of sophisticated methods
to measure time and frequency. From the highly devel-
oped pendulum clocks of around 1900 to today’s most
advanced Cs atomic clocks, realizing the SI time unit,
the increase in relative accuracy from 10−7 to 10−15 was
mainly made possible by an increase in the operational
frequency from the Hz to the GHz range. With opti-
cal comb generators based on femtosecond lasers [1] now
optical frequencies can be connected to radio frequen-
cies with an uncertainty below 10−18 [2], enabling opti-
cal clocks at frequencies that are ﬁve orders of magnitude
higher than the frequency of the Cs transition.

With this ’clockwork’ available the performance of an
optical clock primarily depends on the ’pendulum’, i.e.
on the atomic or molecular transition, and equally im-
portant on the method that is used to interrogate the
’pendulum’ with the least noise while keeping all dis-
turbances at a minimum.
In an optical clock this cor-
responds to probing the transition at the best possible
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and stabilizing the laser to
the true undisturbed line center.

The achieved uncertainties of optical clocks based on
single ions of . 10−14 (Hg+ [3], Yb+ [4]) and on large
numbers of neutral absorbers of & 10−14 (H [5], Ca [3])
are still about an order of magnitude worse than the best
Cs atomic clocks [6, 7, 8]. In contrast to the single ion
standards, where the absorber is conﬁned to a small vol-
ume, the neutral atom standards are ultimately limited
by the residual velocity of the absorbers, but, on the
other hand, beneﬁt from the higher signal to noise ra-
tio due to the large number of atoms which may lead to
exceptionally low instabilities.

In this letter we show on the example of the calcium
standard how the use of ultracold atoms makes neutral
atom optical frequency standards competitive in accu-
racy to the best microwave standards and improves the
stability to unprecedented levels.

For the interrogation of optical transitions of laser-
cooled atoms generally a ’separated ﬁeld excitation’ [9] in
the time domain [10, 11, 12] with two consecutive pairs

of laser pulses from opposite directions is used. Such a
pulsed excitation scheme represents an atom interferom-
eter with laser pulses acting as beam splitters in analogy
to an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer [13].

The excitation sequence leads to a cosine-shaped sig-
nal where the argument of the cosine is given by the
phase Φ = 4π Tsep(νlaser
φ3)
which depends on the time Tsep between the pulses in
νCa and the
each pulse pair, the laser detuning νlaser
laser phases φi in the i-th interaction. These phases ap-
pear in this atom-light interferometer because the phase
of each beamsplitting laser pulse is transferred to the
atomic partial wave. For perfect alignment these phase
diﬀerences cancel, however, net phase diﬀerences remain
when atoms of the cloud move between the pulses to a
position where the local phase of the laser is diﬀerent,
e.g. due to curved wavefronts or tilted laser beams [14].
To achieve optimum visibility of the resulting interfer-
ence fringes, 50 % splitters are necessary. For resonant
excitation this requires π/2-pulses, deﬁned by the Rabi

In particular for narrow linewidth γ, as needed in a fre-
quency standard, the Rabi frequency at the available
laser intensity I is rather low, setting a lower limit on
1 µs in our experiment.

For non-resonant excitation, the excitation probability is
diminished with a half width equal to the Fourier width
of the single pulse. Due to the Doppler eﬀect this trans-
lates to an acceptance range of atomic velocities, that
eﬀectively contribute to the interference signal. For our
setup this acceptance range is in the order of 15 cm/s. For
broader velocity distributions only a part of the atomic
ensemble contributes to the atom interferences, thereby
reducing the contrast and the SNR.

In addition, the velocity dependent excitation proba-
bility inﬂuences the amplitude and the incoherent back-
ground of the observed signal. This background may shift
the central interference fringe from the undisturbed line
center. To correct for this shift and to recover the undis-
turbed center the signal has to be calculated by an in-
tegration over the actual velocity distribution, which be-

all atoms contribute to the interference signal, leading to
an observed contrast of 0.36 that is 70% of the optimum
contrast achievable with atoms at rest. The measured in-
terference pattern is in good agreement with calculations
based on a spinor approach [10]. The small deviations
from theory can be attributed to slow variations of atom
number during the long scanning time of 40 min.

Because the Fourier width of the exciting pulses is
much better controllable than the velocity distribution
of the atoms, theoretical calculations for the ultracold
atoms will now allow us to estimate systematic shifts of
the interference pattern with reduced uncertainty. From
the experience with the Cs atomic clock [6], where an
accuracy of 10−5 of the fringe width is realized in part
due to the good theoretic knowledge of the line proﬁle,
it may now be possible to stabilize a laser to an optical
transition with similar accuracy .

The SNR of the detection scheme used so far is lim-
ited by ﬂuctuations in the atom number and by the shot
noise of the detected ﬂuorescence photons, because only
one photon per excited atom is emitted and from those
only a small fraction can be detected. The ultimate sta-
bility σy of a frequency standard is given by the quantum
√N [18] where N is the
projection noise limit to σy
number of atoms contributing to the signal. To reach this
limit a detection probability close to unity is necessary. It
can be obtained by detecting ground state atoms via their
resonance ﬂuorescence when cycled on the cooling tran-
sition in the singlet system, which gives a high number of
photons per atom. However, such electron shelving de-
tection schemes [19] for optical frequency standards with
cold atoms have suﬀered from atom number ﬂuctuations
[20] or from heating of the atoms when a normalisation

comes less reliable as the velocity spread becomes wider
than the acceptance range.

We realize a neutral atom optical frequency standard
by stabilizing a laser (λ = 657 nm) to the intercombina-
tion transition 1S0–3P1 of 40Ca (ﬁg. 1) which has a natu-
ral linewidth of γ/2π = 320 Hz. Like other alkaline earth
elements, 40Ca has a 1S0 ground state that is little sen-
sitive to external ﬁelds, making it an ideal candidate for
an optical frequency standard, and a nearly closed dipole
transition 1S0–1P1 for eﬀective laser cooling. About 107
atoms at a temperature of a few millikelvin are prepared
by means of a magneto-optical trap (MOT). The corre-
sponding velocity width of this cold ensemble previously
10−14
limited the uncertainty of the Ca standard to 2
×
[15] as a result of the inﬂuences mentioned above.

To overcome this limitation we applied a new scheme
for Doppler-cooling on the narrow intercombination tran-
sition [16] leading to ultracold atoms with a theoretical
limit for calcium of 30 nK [17]. The small scattering force
achievable on that transition of only 1.5 times the grav-
itational force was increased by quenching the 3P1 state
via the 3P1–1D2 transition (ﬁg. 1). With this cooling
scheme the atoms can be trapped and the temperature is
reduced by more than two orders of magnitude to below
T = 10 µK.

The interrogation is performed with a ballistically ex-
panding ensemble of ultracold Ca atoms released from
the MOT, where the interference pattern is measured by
detecting the ﬂuorescence emitted in the decay of the
3P1 state after the last pulse of the atom interferometric
sequence. Now, the frequency width of the whole sig-
nal is given by the Fourier width of the exciting pulses
(ﬁg. 2) which is dramatically diﬀerent from the signal
of cold atoms (T = 2.7 mK, inset of ﬁg. 2) where the
width is given by the Doppler width. Therefore nearly

was applied [11]. The novel scheme presented here mea-
sures both the ground and the excited state atoms after
the interferometry. Immediately after the last pulse of
the atom interferometric sequence the number of atoms
in the ground state is measured by cycling on the 1S0–1P1
transition by a resonant single laser beam and detection
of the ﬂuorescence. By the radiation pressure the atoms
are accelerated and should leave the interaction region.
After one to two natural lifetimes of the 3P1 state this
measurement is repeated, giving a measure for the num-
ber of atoms that have been in the excited state after the
interferometry.
In addition to waiting for the sponta-
neous decay also a pulse on the quenching transition was
applied. From both values a normalized excitation prob-
ability independent of atom number ﬂuctuations can be
derived. Fig. 3 shows interference fringes with a period
of 2.3 kHz that are detected with the new state selective
scheme. The SNR is increased by a factor of 6 compared
to the SNR reached with the previous detection method,
mainly limited by amplitude noise of the detection laser.

This scheme is particularly suited for ultracold atoms
due to the low average velocity and the slow expansion
of the atomic cloud by less than 50 µm, while for a cold
ensemble, part of the excited atoms would have left the
detection region before decaying to the ground state. Our
new simple scheme avoids any heating of the ensemble be-
fore the spectroscopy and allows the elimination of atom
number ﬂuctuations. Hence, no basic limitation exists
any longer that prevents one from reaching the quantum
projection noise limit. For typical values of our appara-
10−17 in only 1 s seems possible,

which would be better than that of any existing optical
and microwave frequency standard.

FIG. 4: Shift of the interferogram of a symmetric three-pulse
interferometer with an intentionally misaligned laser beam.
a) With ultracold atoms (v⊥ = 7.5 cm/s) the measured
phase shift is determined by the deviation of 0.09 degrees
from horizontal alignment. b) With an ensemble at 2.8 mK
(v⊥ = 1.1 m/s) the gravitational contribution (the same as in
a)) is hidden by the contribution of the wavefront curvature.

At the same time the utilization of ultracold atoms
leads to a considerably increased accuracy. The main
contribution to the uncertainty of the Ca frequency stan-
dard arises from residual ﬁrst order Doppler eﬀects due
to wavefront imperfections of the exciting laser beams.
E.g., in a symmetric three-pulse atom interferometer with
equal pulse separation Tsep the movement of the atoms
through the wavefronts (radius of curvature R) of the
exciting laser beam results in a phase shift

beam (R
time between the pulses is shown in ﬁg. 4 for a Doppler-
cooled ensemble (T = 2.8 mK) and for a quench-cooled
ensemble (T = 14 µK). Because of the reduction of v2
⊥ by
a factor of more than 200, the second term in the above
equation becomes negligible and the remaining phase
shift can be fully explained by the slight deviation from
horizontal alignment of the laser beam (~k~g
= 0) while for
the Doppler-cooled ensemble this eﬀect is hidden by the
much stronger inﬂuence of the wavefront curvature. In
a four-pulse interferometer these phase shifts lead to an
frequency error of ∆ν = (A1(2T1+T )+A2(2T1+3T ))/8π
where A1 and A2 denote the factor A in eq. 1 for the di-
rection of the ﬁrst and the second pair of pulses and T1

to a very high degree by optical means. A measurement
of the phase shifts in two 3-pulse interferometers there-
fore can be used to correct this frequency oﬀset to a large
amount [14, 15]. Extensive investigations show, that the
low velocity of the ultracold atoms combined with an op-
timized alignment of the exciting laser beams will reduce
the contribution of velocity-dependent eﬀects to the un-
certainty of the Ca optical frequency standard from 4 Hz
to only 150 mHz [15].

At this level other contributions like collisions be-
tween the atoms will play the dominant role. From
our present measurements at T
3 mK we estimate
the coeﬃcient of the density-dependent frequency shift
10−30 m−3 [15] which is more than
α = (3.0
a factor of 200 smaller than in the Cs microwave clock
and still smaller than in the Rb microwave clock. With
the accuracy and stability now at hand using ultracold
atoms this dependence can be measured more accurately
and then be used to correct the clock frequency accord-
ingly. Altogether, the expected total relative uncertainty
will be 8

10−16.

In conclusion, we showed how the neutral atom opti-
cal frequency standard can reach an expected uncertainty
of below 10−15 and a quantum projection noise limited
10−17 in only 1 s, which will make it com-
stability of 4
petitive in accuracy and superior in stability to existing
microwave standards and single ion optical clocks. Be-
sides the use as an optical clock the sensitivity, the high
signal-to-noise ratio and the reliable theoretical modeling
of the atom interferences can be used for various sensor
applications.

Abstract

We assume all interaction to be Coulombic and solve the modiﬁed Faddeev
equation for energies between the P s(n = 2) and ¯H(n = 3), which involve six
and eight open channels. We ﬁnd that 99% of the antihydrogen are formed in
¯H(n = 2). Just above the P s(n = 2) threshold the S, P, and D partial waves
contribute more than 4000 square Bohr radii near the maximum. Evidences
indicate that the induced long range dipole potential from the degenerate
P s(n = 2) targets is responsible for such a large antihydrogen formation cross
section.

Due to the degeneracy of the excited hydrogen targets a long range dipole potential is
induced in the ﬁeld of the incoming charged particle. This potential is well known to be
responsible for the formation of Feshbach resonances just below the n ≥ 2 thresholds [1,2]. In
the absence of relativistic eﬀects and low lying open channels this attractive dipole potential
can support an inﬁnite set of bound states just below the threshold. Relativistic corrections
remove the degeneracy and cut down the number of such states to only a few. The presence
of low lying open channels embedding them in the continuum, they become resonant states
and cause closely spaced oscillations in the cross section just below the threshold.

Gilitis and Damburg [2] pointed out that due to the Levinson theorem [3] similar oscil-
lations exist just above the threshold. Our S-state cross sections in the energy gap between
the P s(n = 2) and ¯H(n = 3) thresholds indeed reveal such oscillations and the antihydro-
gen formation cross section is greatly enhanced in this region slightly above the P s(n = 2)
threshold. It is interesting to point out that the locations of the two Feshbach resonances
below the ¯H(n = 3) threshold coincide almost exactly to the two minimums of the anti-
hydrogen formation cross section curve. In addition, antihydrogen formation cross sections
for P and D partial waves are calculated for a number of energies.
It is shown that the
total antihydrogen formation cross sections from S, P and D partial waves rise almost up to
1400πa2

0 near the maximum region.

The calculations are carried out using the modiﬁed Faddeev equations. The details of
this method are given in Ref. [4]. We provide an outline below. The mass-scaled Jacobi
vectors are deﬁned as:

xα = τα(rβ − rγ), yα = µα

rα −

2mβmγ/(mβ + mγ) and µα =

2mα(1 − mα/M), M = mα + mβ + mγ, and
where τα =
(α, β, γ) are cyclic permutations of (1, 2, 3). The mass of the antiproton used is m1 =
q
1836.1527, the mass of the electron and the positron are equal, m2 = m3 = 1 (the values are
given in atomic units). The Jacobi vectors of diﬀerent channels are related by the orthogonal
transformation:

In our particular case V3, the interaction between the ¯p and e−, is a repulsive Coulomb
potential which does not support two-body bound states. There are no asymptotic channels
associated with this fragmentation. Consequently the total three-body wave function can
be expressed in two components

Ψ = ψ1(x1, y1) + ψ2(x2, y2).

Asymptotically ψ1 consists of an electron bound to the positron and a free antiproton, while
ψ2, the rearrangement Faddeev component describes asymptotically an positron bound to
the antiproton and a free electron.

We use the modiﬁed Faddeev equations:

(−∆xα − ∆yα + Vα + ¯Vα − E)ψα(xα, yα) =

−V (s)

α ψβ(xβ, yβ),

¯Vα = V3 + V (l)
(¯p, e+) pairs, respectively, are separated into short- and long-range terms

β , α 6= β = 1, 2, and V1 and V2, the interactions between the (e−, e+) and

V (s)
α = Vα(xα)ζα(xα, yα),
V (l)
α = Vα(xα)(1 − ζα(xα, yα)).

The function ζα(xα, yα) vanishes asymptotically within the three-body sector, where xα ∼
yα → ∞, and approaches one in the two-body cluster region, where xα << yα → ∞. We
use the following function having the required property:

ζ(x, y) = 2 {1 + exp [(x/x0)ν/(1 + y/y0)]}

−1 ,

where ν must be larger than 2 [4]. In principle, x0 and y0 are arbitrary, but they should be
chosen to be consistent with the size of the scattering system for a rapid convergence.

In bipolar basis [5] the Faddeev component is given in the form

The summation with respect to angular momentum channels is truncated in Eq. (11).
When the proper cut-oﬀ parameters x0 and y0 in (9) is chosen the number of terms used for
the S, P, and D partial waves ranges from 10 to 12 for the ﬁrst Faddeev channel (¯p+P s), 8 to
10 for the second Faddeev channel (e− + ¯H). The optimal choices of parameters satisfy the
conditions xαmax ≈ 10x0; yαmax ≈ 10y0, α = 1, 2, where xαmax, yαmax are the respective cut-
oﬀ distances which divide the asymptotic and interior regions. In the energy gap between
P s(n = 2) and ¯H(n = 3) we used 110a0 and 75a0 for xαmax, α = 1, 2, and 450a0 and 150a0
for yαmax, respectively.

In the MFE approach the total three-body wave function ψ(σ)(x, y), for each open channel
αlλ as its components. We further split the wave function into

σ, is a vector having all ψL
interior and asymptotic parts using the vector equation

with spline continuity of values, ﬁrst and second derivatives across the boundaries. They
are otherwise identically zero in the interior regions. ˜Kσ′σ is related to the K-matrix by a
kinematic factor [6].

H is composed of two diagonal blocks of operators corresponding to the two Faddeev compo-

˜Kσ′,σU (σ′)
vectors. Replace the unknown vector F (σ)(x, y) by F (σ)(x, y) = Uσ(x, y) +

The U’s are solved using ﬁfth order Hermite polynomial spline expansion [5–7]. Matching the
interior wave function F (σ)(x, y) with the known asymptotic wave functions at or near yαmax
we obtain highly over determined linear equations for the unknown ˜Kσ′σ. Two independent
methods are used for the solutions: (1) a standard least-square procedure and (2) projection
on open channels. The details are given in [5,6].

The size of matrix equation used to solve (17,18) varies depending on the energy and
the total angular momentum. They range from about 100000 × 100000 to 150000 × 150000
for results accurate at least 5%. The solutions are obtained using a solver in ScaLAPACK
library on the massive parallel Blue Horizon IBM computer at the San Diego Supercomputer
Center.

In the energy gap between P s(n = 2) and ¯H(n = 3) there are six open channels for S
partial wave. The elastic cross sections are plotted in Fig. 1, the horizontal axis plots energies
in P s(n = 2) + ¯p channel. The elastic cross section from e− + ¯H(1s) and ¯p + P s(1s) are
relatively very small, they are not visible, that from e− + ¯H(2s) e− + ¯H(2p) are somewhat
larger. They are plotted in Fig. 1, for comparison with the huge elastic cross sections
from the channels ¯p + P s(2s) and ¯p + P s(2p). Due to the large induced dipole moment of
the excited positronium, the Gilitis-Damburg oscillations are clearly seen in Fig. 1 below
0.003Ry, the energies are measured from the P s(n = 2) threshold. The cross sections are
rather monotonous between 0.003−0.008Ry. The structure below the ¯H(n = 3) threshold is
due to the two S-state resonances located at 0.8835Ry 0.8875Ry measured from the ¯H(1s)
threshold, or 0.0090Ry and 0.0130Ry relative to P s(n = 2) threshold. One notices that the
oscillations of the two degenerate 2s and 2p channels are nearly 180◦ out of phase in the
region of Feshbach resonances, although the eﬀect is distorted by the statistical weight of
1/3 on the 2p cross sections.

Fig. 2 presents the S-state antihydrogen formation cross sections in the same energy gap.
The formation cross section are greatly enhanced in the oscillation region below 0.003Ry.
0. The two minima below the ¯H(n = 3) threshold
The largest cross section calculated is 219πa2
are located almost exactly at the location of the two Feshbach resonances [8,9].

Calculations of the P and D partial wave cross sections have been carried out for a
number of energies in the oscillating region. There are 8 open channels and 64 partial cross
sections, most of them will not be reported here. Table I presents all antihydrogen formation
cross sections of S, P and D partial waves at four energies. There are 9 antihydrogen
formation partial cross sections for S-wave and 16 such partial cross sections for P and D
waves, respectively. We group them into three partial sums, σ(1)
L , where L is the
angular momentum (S, P, D). σ(1)
L is the sum of all partial cross sections with antihydrogen
formed in 1s state. σ(2)
L is the sum of all partial cross sections having antihydrogen formed in
2s and 2p states but originated from P s(1s) target. σ(3)
L is the sum of all partial cross sections
with antihydrogen formed in 2s and 2p states but originated from excited P s targets.

L and σ(3)

L , σ(2)

Our calculations highlight three important points:

1. The P and D partial waves follow the same tendency of strong oscillations near P s(n =
2) threshold similarly to that of S-partial wave. Table I shows as σS increases towards
the P s(n = 2) threshold, so do σP and σD. Seaton [1] pointed out that the strength of
the dipole potential from n = 2 target can support Feshbach resonances for all partial
waves with L ≤ 2.

2. Since the cross section depend on the kinematic factor 1/k2

i in (15), where ki is the mo-
mentum of the incoming channel, the oscillations are ampliﬁed near the lower threshold
P s(n = 2), and hence the antihydrogen formation cross sections are also greatly en-
hanced. On the other hand, the Feshbach resonances just below the upper ¯H(n = 3)

5

threshold have negligible contribution to the antihydrogen formation cross sections.
In fact, Fig. 2 shows two minima in antihydrogen formation cross section located at
0.8835Ry and 0.8875Ry above ¯H(1s) threshold, respectively. Archer and Parker [8]
found one S-state resonance at −0.11492Ry below breakup, or 0.88454Ry above ¯H(1s).
Ho and Green [9] found two S-state resonances at −0.11606Ry and −0.11206Ry below
breakup, or 0.88340Ry and 0.88740Ry above ¯H(1s). We used the threshold energy
−0.99946Ry for ¯H(1s), due to ﬁnite ¯p mass, to calculate all resonance positions. In
comparison, our novel method to determine Feshbach resonance position seems to have
at least three to four digits of accuracy!

3. Not surprisingly, the long range polarization potential, mainly the dipole potential,
couples strongly only amongst the excited 2s and 2p states which lie just below the
targets P s(n = 2). The ground states P s(1s) and ¯H(1s) contribute less than 2% of the
antihydrogen formation cross section, and even less of them are formed in ¯H(1s). As
a result, near 99% of the antihydrogen are formed in 2s and 2p states with P s(n = 2)
targets.

Archer and Parker [8] solved the Schr¨odinger equation using a form of hyperspherical
coordinates. They calculated S-state partial cross sections up to H(n = 4) threshold.
However, they purposely avoided the long range polarization potentials by projecting out
only those with ground states targets and using cut-oﬀ hyperradius of ρ = 120.0a0. We
used cut-oﬀ coordinates that are equivalent to ρ ≈ 470a0. Our corresponding partial cross
sections in the energy-gap between P s(n = 2) and ¯H(n = 3) are generally 25% lower. The
complete coupling of all six open channels in our calculation may be responsible for the
diﬀerences.

0, where our value at this point is approximately 396πa2

Igarashi et. al. [10] made hyperspherical coupled-channel calculations for antihydrogen
formation in a broad range of energies in ¯p + P s scattering including partial waves up to
angular momentum L = 12 and included cross section from Born approximations for L ≥ 13.
Unfortunately there is only one of their energy points fell within the gap between P s(n = 2)
and ¯H(n = 3) thresholds. This point is located at ∼ 0.002Ry, its total formation cross
section is approximately 640πa2
0 from
three partial waves. This means that, at least at this energy, the lowest three partial waves
contribute about 62% of the total formation cross section. Fig. 2 and Table I show that this
energy point is not in the region of optimal antihydrogen formation. Our largest calculated
antihydrogen formation cross section is 1397πa2
0 from the lowest three partial waves. The
energy at this point is 0.000494Ry. Table I shows that at this energy σD/σS = 3.15. This is
less then the factor 2L + 1 in (15). But it is expected that higher partial waves contribute
much less eﬀectively at such low energy. The long range dipole potential from P s(n = 2)
targets is expected to cause oscillations for all partial waves with L ≤ 2. We expect a much
more drastic drop in σL/σS for L ≥ 3. Works are in progress to calculate contributions from
L ≥ 3.

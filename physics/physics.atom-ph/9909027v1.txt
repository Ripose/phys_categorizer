The atom or molecule will not have accelerated entering
the electric ﬁeld plates but will decelerate when it leaves
the electric ﬁeld, thus slowing. Longitudinal cooling is
achieved by applying a decreasing electric ﬁeld, so that
in a pulse of atoms or molecules, the fastest ones, arriving
ﬁrst, experience the greatest slowing (Fig. 2).

A method of slowing, accelerating, cooling, and bunch-
ing molecules and neutral atoms using time-varying elec-
tric ﬁeld gradients is demonstrated with cesium atoms in
a fountain. The eﬀects are measured and found to be
in agreement with calculation. Time-varying electric ﬁeld
gradient slowing and cooling is applicable to atoms that
have large dipole polarizabilities,
including atoms that are
not amenable to laser slowing and cooling, to Rydberg
atoms, and to molecules, especially polar molecules with
large electric dipole moments. The possible applications of
this method include slowing and cooling thermal beams of
atoms and molecules, launching cold atoms from a trap into
a fountain, and measuring atomic dipole polarizabilities.

I. INTRODUCTION

Time-invariant electric ﬁeld gradients have long been
used to deﬂect beams of molecules and neutral atoms.
However, as we will show in this paper, time-varying elec-
tric ﬁeld gradients can be used to accelerate, slow, cool,
or bunch these same beams. We demonstrate slowing,
cooling, and bunching of cold cesium atoms in a foun-
tain, measure these eﬀects and ﬁnd good agreement with
calculation. The possible applications of the time-varying
electric ﬁeld gradient technique include slowing and cool-
ing thermal beams of molecules and atoms, launching
cold atoms from a trap into a fountain, beam transport,
and measuring atomic dipole polarizabilities.

The principle behind time-varying electric ﬁeld gra-
dient slowing is that an electric ﬁeld gradient exerts a
force on an electric dipole (thus accelerating or decel-
erating it) but a spatially uniform electric ﬁeld, even if
it is time-varying, exerts no force on an electric dipole.
Thus, an atom with an induced electric dipole moment
or a molecule with a ‘permanent’ electric dipole moment
(with negative interaction energy in an electric ﬁeld) will
accelerate when it enters an electric ﬁeld and decelerate
back to its original velocity when it leaves the electric
ﬁeld. If we add a uniform electric ﬁeld region between
the entrance and exit, as in a pair of parallel electric ﬁeld
plates (Fig. 1), we can delay turning on the electric ﬁeld
until the atom or molecule is in this uniform electric ﬁeld.

FIG. 1. Schematic diagram of slowing with a time-varying
electric ﬁeld gradient. Molecules or neutral atoms enter the
plates with the electric ﬁeld turned oﬀ (a). When they are
between the plates, a voltage is applied producing a spatially
uniform electric ﬁeld (b). They exit the plates, traversing an
electric ﬁeld gradient where they are slowed (c). This process
may be repeated with additional sets of electric ﬁeld plates.

The time-varying electric ﬁeld gradient technique can
be useful for slowing and cooling thermal beams of atoms
with large dipole polarizabilities and polar molecules
with large electric dipole moments. Many atoms and
most molecules are not amenable to laser slowing and
cooling, and presently few alternative techniques [1] ex-
ist. Slow molecules have application to molecular beam
spectroscopy, the study of chemical reactions, low energy
collisions, surface scattering, and trapping.

In molecular beam spectroscopy of long-lived states,
slowing the molecules to increase the transit time through
the observation region can improve the spectroscopic res-
olution, yielding better separation of spectroscopic fea-
tures. In thermal detection of molecular beams, the frac-
tion of molecules in long-lived vibrational states is mea-
sured by the extra energy that they contribute to a ther-
mal detector [2]. The sensitivity of this method can be
increased by decreasing the kinetic energy of the beam.

FIG. 2. Schematic diagram of longitudinal cooling with a
time-varying electric ﬁeld gradient. The relative velocity of
the particles is indicated by the length of their arrows and
the electric ﬁeld strength by the density of ﬁeld lines. A pulse
of molecules or neutral atoms expands as it enters the plates
with the fastest molecules or atoms in the lead(a). The same
procedure as in Fig. 1 is followed except that the electric
ﬁeld decreases over time. The fastest, exiting ﬁrst, lose more
kinetic energy (b) than slower ones that exit later when the
ﬁeld gradient is smaller (c). Alternatively, if the ﬁeld is turned
on before all of the atoms have entered the electric ﬁeld plates,
the slowest atoms are accelerated as they enter the plates.
With suﬃcient ﬁeld strength, the relative velocities of the
slow and fast molecules can be interchanged and the pulse
will rebunch.

Similarly, for control of chemical reaction pathways, re-
ducing the kinetic energy a beam of molecules to just
above the reaction threshold energy may enhance the ef-
fect of orientation or state preparation [3].

In the study of elastic scattering from surfaces, he-
lium and a few other light gasses are the most used pro-
jectiles because a small energy transfer to the surface
and narrow velocity distribution [4] are essential. Simi-
larly, other forms of surface scattering [5] also utilize light
atoms and light molecules (such as H2, HD, CO, NO, and
Ne). Heavier atoms and molecules that have been slowed
and cooled will also meet the requirements of many sur-
face scattering experiments. Thus, time-varying electric
ﬁeld gradient slowing and cooling could make many more
species available for surface scattering experiments.

The trapping of molecules [6] can increase conﬁnement,
observation, or interaction time by orders of magnitude,
create high densities, or allow the molecules to be cooled
by evaporative cooling or other slow cooling methods.
With the possible exception of a toroidal storage ring
trap [7], slow cold molecules are a necessary prerequisite
for all proposed [8–12] or existing [13] neutral molecule
traps and would be an asset for a storage ring [7]. Time-
varying electric ﬁeld gradient slowing and cooling can
provide beams of slow, cold polar molecules in vacuum
and is compatible with all of these proposed or existing

2

methods for trapping molecules.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
The interaction energies of atoms and molecules in elec-
tric ﬁelds and the principles of slowing, cooling, and
bunching molecules and atoms with time-varying electric
ﬁeld gradients is discussed in detail in Section II. Our ex-
periment is described and its results are compared with
calculation in Section III. And ﬁnally, in Section IV,
we examine how the time-varying electric ﬁeld gradient
method can be applied to slowing of thermal atoms and
molecules, measurements of atomic dipole polarizabili-
ties, atom optics, and launching atoms from traps.

II. ATOMS AND MOLECULES IN ELECTRIC
FIELDS

A. Neutral atoms in electric ﬁelds

Time-varying electric ﬁeld gradient slowing utilizes the
shift in an atom’s potential energy as it travels through
a time- and spatially- varying electric ﬁeld. The eﬀect
of an electric ﬁeld on an atom’s potential energy is de-
scribed, to lowest order in the electric ﬁeld, by the dipole
polarizability of the atom, deﬁned as the ratio of the in-
duced electric dipole moment to the external electric ﬁeld
[14,15]. Although the dipole polarizability is a tensor,
the non-scalar terms are usually small, producing only
negligible variations in the polarizability of the diﬀerent
ground state sublevels [14,15], and do not aﬀect the pro-
cesses that we will be discussing. Thus the induced dipole
moment is, to a good approximation, a scalar, and the
potential energy, E, is given, to lowest order in the elec-
tric ﬁeld, by E = −αE2/2, where E is the magnitude of
the electric ﬁeld and α is the scalar dipole polarizability.
Because α is a scalar, the potential energy depends only
on the electric ﬁeld’s magnitude and not its direction.

In a spatially varying electric ﬁeld, the force is F =
(1/2)α∇(E2), which, for all ground state atoms, is in the
direction of increasing electric ﬁeld magnitude (strong
ﬁeld seeking). As with any conservative potential, the
change in an atom’s kinetic energy, as it travels between
two points in space, is path independent and equal to the
change in potential energy between those points.

f − E2

For example, a Cs atom traveling from a region, Ei of
no ﬁeld, to a region Ef of 107 V/m, gains kinetic energy,
KE, by an amount ∆KE = −∆E = α(E2
i )/2 =
3.3 × 10−25 J = 24 mK, where we have used the value of
2
6.63×10−39J/(V/m)
(or 59.6×10−24 cm3) for the dipole
polarizability of Cs [16,17]. Since we will be interested
in atomic beams from thermal sources (see Section IV),
we will use energy units of kelvin with the conversion
7.243×1022 K/J. The velocity of an atom after traversing
the potential is v2
f = 2(∆KE)/M + v2
i , where vi and vf
are the initial and ﬁnal velocities, respectively, and M is
the mass. For vi = 0, the ﬁnal velocity for the example
given above would be 1.70 m/s.

B. Polar molecules in electric ﬁelds

In addition to a dipole polarizability, polar molecules
have an intrinsic separation of charge that produces a
dipole that can align with an external electric ﬁeld to
yield a large net electric dipole moment [18]. When the
interaction of the electric dipole moment, de, of a lin-
ear polar molecule with an external electric ﬁeld is large
compared to the molecular rotational energy, rotation is
suppressed in favor of libration about the direction of
the electric ﬁeld. The potential energy of the low-lying
rotational levels then approaches E = −deE and is al-
ways negative [19]. In a spatially varying electric ﬁeld,
the resulting force is F = de∇E, which, as for ground
state atoms, is in the direction of increasing electric ﬁeld
magnitude (strong ﬁeld seeking).

As an example, consider cesium ﬂuoride which has
a very large dipole moment [20] of de = 2.65 ×
10−29 J/(V/m) (or 7.88 Debye, where 1 Debye = 3.36 ×
10−30 J/(V/m)) and a small rotational constant [21] of
Be = 0.27 K (or 0.188 cm−1).
In its lowest angular
momentum state (J = 0), and traveling from a region
of no ﬁeld to a region of 107 V/m, CsF gains kinetic
energy, KE, by roughly the amount ∆KE = −∆E =
de(Ef − Ei) = 2.65 × 10−22 J = 19 K. A more accurate
value, calculated using the formulas from Von Meyenn
[19], is 16 K. This is about 640 times larger than for Cs,
as discussed earlier.

As in the atomic case, the ﬁnal velocity of the
f =
CsF molecule, after traversing the potential,
2(∆KE)/M + v2
i , where vi and vf are the initial and ﬁnal
velocities, respectively, and M is the mass. For vi = 0,
the ﬁnal velocity for the example given above, would be
45.7 m/s. Equivalently, a 45.7 m/s CsF molecule travel-
ing from a region of 107 V/m electric ﬁeld, to a region of
no ﬁeld, would be slowed to rest.

C. Slowing molecules and atoms

A practical apparatus for slowing should have the elec-
tric ﬁeld gradient perpendicular to the ﬁeld. Otherwise,
a beam of molecules or atoms traversing the electric ﬁeld
gradient is likely to strike one of the surfaces used to form
the electric ﬁeld. A simple apparatus that meets this re-
quirement is a set of parallel electric ﬁeld plates (Fig. 1)
attached to a voltage source that can quickly be ramped
from zero.

To operate a set of electric ﬁeld plates as a time-varying
electric ﬁeld gradient slowing apparatus, we do the fol-
lowing. A neutral atom in its ground state enters the
region between the electric ﬁeld plates with no ﬁeld (the
term atom also applies to clusters and molecules in strong
ﬁeld seeking states). With the atom between the electric
ﬁeld plates, the voltage is turned on producing a uniform
electric ﬁeld. The potential energy of the atom is low-
ered by the electric ﬁeld, but a spatially-uniform, time-

3

varying electric ﬁeld does no work on a dipole, so there
is no change in the kinetic energy of the atom. As the
atom exits the plates, passing through an electric ﬁeld
gradient, to a zero ﬁeld region outside, it gains potential
energy and loses kinetic energy. To accelerate an atom,
the ﬁeld is turned on before the atom enters the electric
ﬁeld plates and is then turned oﬀ before the atom exits.
The latter arrangement can also be used to slow a weak
ﬁeld seeking molecule.

The slowing process may be repeated by arranging a
series of electric ﬁeld plates, each having a voltage ap-
plied once the atom has entered the uniform electric ﬁeld
region. The energy change of the atom, traversing the
sequence, is then cumulative. If a suﬃcient number of
electric ﬁeld plate sections are assembled, it should be
possible to slow a thermal beam of atoms to near rest.

This slowing process is analogous to, but the reverse
of, the acceleration of charged particles in linear accel-
erators [22] and cyclic accelerators [23], where charged
particles accelerate through a sequence of small voltage
gradients. After each voltage gradient, the charged par-
ticles drift through a time-varying, but spatially uniform
voltage, in which the voltage changes or reverses. This
establishes a new voltage gradient without requiring suc-
cessively higher voltages.

The same slowing principle can also be applied using
large magnetic ﬁeld gradients on atoms or paramagnetic
molecules. However, it is more diﬃcult to switch strong
magnetic ﬁelds.

D. Cooling and bunching

A decrease in the longitudinal velocity spread of the
beam can be achieved by applying an electric ﬁeld, that
decreases in time, to atoms that have been arranged ac-
cording to their velocity (Fig. 2). The ﬁrst atoms exiting
the plates are slowed more than the atoms exiting at later
times, when the electric ﬁeld, and hence the electric ﬁeld
gradient, has decreased. A beam of atoms will be ordered
by velocity when a short pulse is allowed to spread.

This is a form of cooling even though the initial
and ﬁnal velocity distributions might not be Maxwell-
Boltzmann. The process conserves phase space (the area
enclosed in a plot of the relative velocity of each particle
versus its relative position) and is analogous to debunch-
ing of a charged particle beam in an accelerator. The
process can also be reversed and used to bunch a beam
so that more atoms arrive at a selected point at the same
time. Bunching can reproduce or even compress the orig-
inal longitudinal spatial distribution of a pulse of atoms
– a useful technique for detecting weak signals.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A. Experimental arrangement

To test the principle of slowing and cooling with time-
varying electric ﬁeld gradients, we slowed, cooled, and
bunched packets of Cs atoms, initially traveling 2 m/s,
using a single set of electric ﬁeld plates with ﬁelds of up
to 5 × 106 V/m. The low initial velocity and large polar-
izability of Cs made it easy to observe and measure the
slowing (0.20 m/s at 5×106 V/m), cooling, and bunching
eﬀects with a single electric ﬁeld region. A schematic of
the apparatus is shown in Fig. 3.

FIG. 3. Schematic of the apparatus used to test slowing
and cooling. The vertical dimension, the collimator, and plate
spacing are to scale. The laser probe beam below the electric
ﬁeld plates is parallel to the plate gap and the probe above
the plates is perpendicular to it. Only four of the six trapping
lasers are shown.

Packets of Cs atoms were launched at rates of 0.25 Hz
to 0.33 Hz from a vapor-capture magneto-optic trap con-
structed along the lines described in Ref. [24,25]. The
laser beams that formed the x-y plane of the trap were
oriented at 45 degrees to the vertical. This made it eas-
ier to perform measurements on the atoms after they had
been launched. The trap temperature, determined by ob-
serving the expansion of the Cs cloud, was about 30 µK.
The trap laser system, which was stable and reliable,
used an external cavity grating conﬁguration with piezo-
electric tuning [26], and a Spectra Diode Labs model
5410-C diode laser with an antireﬂection coating on the
front facet. To launch the Cs atoms, a pair of acousto-
optic modulators blue (red) shifted the upward (down-
ward) pointing laser beams by 5 MHz to form a moving
molasses [25,27].

The tower into which the atoms were launched extends
55 cm above the trapping region. At 20 cm above the
trap, a 1.3 cm aperture restricts the horizontal dimen-
sions of the packet. At 27 cm above the trap, a pair
of stainless steel electric ﬁeld plates, each 2.2 cm tall by

4

1.7 cm wide, straddle the center line. Each electric ﬁeld
plate is supported by a rod extending through a high
voltage vacuum feed-through mounted on a bellows. The
bellows allowed us to vary the spacing between the plates.
Large gap spacings of 6 mm and 8 mm were chosen to
allow the maximum number of atoms through the plates,
and to minimize defocusing eﬀects at the edges of the
plates. See section III D for a discussion of the defocus-
ing eﬀects.

Two high-voltage pulsed power supplies, one positive
and one negative, were used to charge the electric ﬁeld
plates. The heart of each power supply is an automobile
ignition coil driven by a low current DC power supply
that charges a capacitor in series with the input of the
ignition coil [28]. Discharging the capacitor supplies the
input pulse to the coil. For cooling and bunching ex-
periments, a decaying voltage was produced by an RC
circuit at the ignition coil output. The components of
this RC circuit are the high voltage coaxial cable (about
100 pF/m) from the ignition coil output to the high volt-
age feed through, and a resistor to ground. For slowing
measurements, a high resistance was chosen to make the
time constant long compared to the transit time of the
atoms through the electric ﬁeld plates.

For Cs atom time-of-ﬂight velocity measurements, we
formed probe laser beams using a small fraction of the
light from the trapping laser. One probe beam passed
0.5 cm below the electric ﬁeld plates and a second probe
beam, perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld, passed 14 cm
above the ﬁrst. The probe beam intensities were mea-
sured with photo diodes. The signal for the atoms pass-
ing through a probe beam was the attenuation of the
probe beam due to scattering by the passing atoms.

The launched atoms arrived at the electric ﬁeld plates
in a packet 1.5 cm long – longer than the uniform region
of the electric ﬁeld plates. It was easier to understand the
results of slowing measurements if the packet of Cs atoms
ﬁt entirely within the uniform region. The packet was
trimmed, using the lower probe beam, which deﬂected
the atoms suﬃciently, so that they were not detected
by the second probe. To accept only the center of the
packet, the laser was shifted out of resonance for a few
milliseconds. We were thus able to reduce the vertical
size of the packet at the lower probe from 1.5 cm to about
0.3 cm. The arrival time of the atoms at the upper probe
was measured relative to the launch time. The stability
of the launch was checked by periodically measuring the
arrival time at the lower probe.

B. Slowing

The time of arrival of the packet at the upper probe, as
a function of the applied electric ﬁeld, is shown in Fig. 4.
The electric ﬁeld was turned on after the Cs atoms en-
tered the uniform ﬁeld region of the plates, and was kept
nearly constant as the atoms exited the plates. Increas-

ing the electric ﬁeld delayed the arrival of the Cs atoms
at the upper probe. The width of the packet increased
because the packet had more time to spread.

FIG. 4. Slowing of Cs atoms by time-varying electric ﬁeld
gradients. The time of arrival at the upper probe is plotted
for diﬀerent electric ﬁelds used for the slowing. The horizon-
tal scale is the time elapsed from when the magnetic ﬁeld
coils turn oﬀ for the launch. The vertical scale is the electric
ﬁeld and superimposed on each ﬁeld setting is the inverted
absorption signal at the upper probe.

For a quantitative measurement of the slowing, we cal-
culated the loss in kinetic energy, based on the increase in
transit time, and plotted this quantity as a function of the
square of the electric ﬁeld. This is shown in Fig. 5. Two
plate spacings, 6 mm and 8 mm, were used. We compare
these data points with the expected energy loss, calcu-
2
lated from αE2/2 for α = 6.63 × 10−39J/(V/m)
[16].
The eﬀect is clearly quadratic in the electric ﬁeld and is
close to the predicted size. The systematic error is con-
sistent with the large uncertainty in our measurement of
the electric ﬁeld.

C. Cooling and compression

To cool and bunch the Cs atoms we matched the de-
cay time of the electric ﬁeld with the transit time of the
atoms through the electric ﬁeld gradient.
In addition,
we used the full vertical size of the packet, which at the
plates was 1.5 cm and, without cooling or bunching, was
2.5 cm at the upper probe. With this short decay time,
we were able to utilize two methods to cool and bunch
the packets. In the ﬁrst, the electric ﬁeld was turned on
once the whole packet had entered the uniform region.
Here, the faster atoms, exiting ﬁrst, were slowed more
than the slower atoms, reducing the velocity spread. In
the second method, we turned on the electric ﬁeld once
the faster atoms in the leading edge of the packet had
entered the uniform region of the ﬁeld, but while the
slower atoms were still in the electric ﬁeld gradient. The

The measurements were made with 6 mm (shown as squares)
and 8 mm (ﬁlled circles) plate spacings. The statistical un-
certainties are within the size of each point. The expected
energy loss, calculated from ∆KE = α(E2

as a line. The systematic uncertainties are 2 percent for the
Cs dipole polarizability and about 10 percent for our electric
ﬁeld. The observed diﬀerences between the measured and
expected energy loss is within these uncertainties.

slower atoms were accelerated into the plates, while the
fastest atoms, already in the uniform ﬁeld region, were
unaﬀected. On exiting the plates, the ﬁeld had decayed
suﬃciently so as not to aﬀect the distribution. However,
with plates of the proper length, additional cooling could
be achieved, on exit, using the ﬁrst method. Bunching
occurs as the packet evolves, if during the process, the
(initially) slow atoms are accelerated to a velocity greater
than that of the fast atoms.

As an example, Fig. 6 shows the arrival time of the
Cs atoms at the upper probe as a function of electric
ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld is turned on when roughly half
of the packet reaches the uniform ﬁeld region. The rest
of the packet is still in the electric ﬁeld gradient. The
electric ﬁeld decays with a RC time constant of 5 ms,
and the packet velocity at this point is roughly 2 m/s.
The eﬀects of cooling and then compression in Fig. 6
are striking. The transit time of the atoms through the
upper probe is reduced from about 16 ms (FWHM) at
zero ﬁeld, to 3 ms at 3.5 × 106 V/m. With a packet
velocity of 1.2 m/s at the upper probe, the transit time
corresponds to a packet length of about 3.6 mm, reduced
from the original 1.5 cm at the electric ﬁeld plates (2.5 cm
at the upper probe).

To compare the experimental results with calculation,
we modeled the time evolution of the longitudinal phase
space of the Cs atoms for the experimental conditions in
Fig. 6. The results are shown in Fig. 7. The electric ﬁeld
along the center line between the plates, used to deter-
mine the potential energy of the Cs atoms at each point,
was calculated by a two-dimensional ﬁnite-element anal-

plate. The magnitude of this force, which transversely
defocuses the packet, depends on the shape of the edges
of the electric ﬁeld plates. In general, any convex (con-
cave) surface on a ﬁeld plate produces a local increase in
the electric ﬁeld gradient towards (away from) the sur-
face.
It should be stressed that the change in kinetic
energy of the atoms is determined by conservation of en-
ergy. All atoms will have their kinetic energy reduced,
by the same amount, after exiting the electric ﬁeld, even
though some may have slightly changed direction.

The defocusing eﬀects can be minimized by using an
electric ﬁeld plate gap that is large compared to the width
of the beam of atoms. However, increasing the gap in-
creases the voltage needed to produce the same electric
ﬁeld, and reduces the maximum electric ﬁeld that can be
sustained. For simplicity, in this experiment, we chose
a small gap-to-beam-width ratio and tolerated some de-
focusing. However, there are more elaborate ﬁeld con-
ﬁgurations for which our calculations show very small
defocusing eﬀects. In Fig. 9, we compare one such set of
electric ﬁeld plates with ﬁeld plates having a simple paral-
lel plate geometry. For an atom slightly oﬀ the midplane,
the transverse force is reduced by about a factor of six
compared to the simple plate geometry. We will discuss
details of focusing and defocusing in a future paper.

IV. APPLICATIONS

1. Electric ﬁelds

While electric ﬁelds of 107 V/m or higher can be
maintained by ordinary metal electrodes with a small
gap spacing, much stronger ﬁelds can be maintained by
heated glass cathodes [29]. Glass cathode systems have
been used to produce large Stark eﬀects in beams of Cs
[30] and Tl atoms [31]. A set of 75 cm long all-glass
electric ﬁeld plates have operated at 4.5 × 107 V/m [31].
Short electric ﬁeld plates with a heated glass cathode
at ground potential, and a metal anode have sustained
electric ﬁelds of 5 × 107 V/m and higher [30].

2. Slowing ground state atoms

Atoms that are of interest for slowing and cooling
by time-varying electric ﬁeld gradients are those with
large dipole polarizabilities that can not be laser slowed
and cooled. The dipole polarizabilities are largest in al-
kali metals and alkali earths. However, actinides, lan-
thanides, and transition elements near an alkali, also have
2
polarizabilities [17] above 1 × 10−39J/(V/m)
, compared
2
to 6.63 × 10−39J/(V/m)
for Cs, which has the highest
known ground state polarizability.

In Fig. 8 we compare the observed Cs beam proﬁle with
the calculation in Fig. 7. The calculation, which is done
in one dimension, and assumes that the initial spatial
distribution of atoms, is Gaussian. The calculated spa-
tial distribution has been converted into time, translated
by about 5 ms, and scaled to align it to the data. There
is good agreement between experiment and calculation,
except for a small diﬀerence between the width of the
calculated and observed peaks (possibly due to the sim-
ple assumptions used in the calculation). We conclude
that one can make reliable calculations of the eﬀects of
time-varying electric ﬁeld gradients on the phase space
evolution of atoms.

D. Defocusing

So far we have only discussed electric ﬁeld conﬁgura-
tions in one dimension. For atoms on the midplane be-
tween two parallel plates there are no additional forces.
However, for atoms in the fringe ﬁeld of the plates, and
not on the midplane, there is a force toward the nearest

FIG. 7. Longitudinal phase space of the Cs atoms cooled and bunched in a time-varying electric ﬁeld gradient. The initial
longitudinal phase space at launch, shown in (a), is approximated by an ellipse with a 3 mm spatial spread and a 0.15 m/s
velocity spread. At 100 ms after launch, (b), the packet has spread to 1 cm and the velocity has decreased due to gravity. The
electric ﬁeld, which has a decay constant of 5 ms, is turned on at 103 ms as the slower atoms reach the electric ﬁeld gradient
at the entrance of the plates. The dashed curve in (b) is the potential energy of the atoms due to the electric ﬁeld. From
103-106 ms the slow atoms are accelerated while the faster atoms within the uniform ﬁeld are unaﬀected. By 108 ms, the packet
is past the electric ﬁeld gradient at the plate entrance and the electric ﬁeld has decayed, so there is little force on the atoms as
they exit the plates. In (b), the kink in the packet (marked A) is now at the same velocity as that of the right-most portion
(marked C). The velocity spread of the packet has been nearly halved. As the packet time-evolves, (c), the spatial separation
between A and B does not change. In addition, the lowest velocity portion (marked B) is retarded and, at 180 ms, lies at
the same spatial coordinate as A. When this occurs, we get a large peak in the absorption signal because the portion between
A and B arrives at the probe, as a bunch, only a few millimeters wide (instead of the 2.5 cm for the uncompressed packet).
The resulting calculated density proﬁle of the packet is shown in (d). The dashed curves in (c) and (d) are the phase space
and density proﬁle, respectively, if no cooling had been utilized. The densities in (d) incorporate an initial assumed Gaussian
phase-space distribution.

As an example, we consider slowing a thermal beam
of neutral americium (atomic number 95) to near rest.
2
With a polarizability [17] of 2.59 × 10−39J/(V/m)
, each
5×107 V/m slowing section will reduce the kinetic energy
by 0.23 K. It is impractical to slow atoms from the peak
of the velocity distribution at the 1500 K needed to form
a beam of Am. However, if one is willing to sacriﬁce
intensity, the slower atoms, from the low velocity tail of
the thermal velocity distribution, are available. The low
velocity atoms from thermal distributions are often used
to load magneto-optic traps, either from a vapor inside
the chamber [24] (as we have done), or from an atomic
beam [32,33]. Recently, Ghaﬀari et. al. [33] developed
an atomic low-pass velocity ﬁlter that passes slow atoms
and blocks fast atoms.

For the Am velocity distribution tail at 1 K (8.4 m/s),
only about ﬁve time-varying electric ﬁeld gradient slow-
ing sections would be needed to bring the atoms to near
rest. The maximum energy spread that can be accepted
by a single section is about equal to the energy decrease in

one section, which for Am is about 0.23 K. Based upon a
Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution inside a 1500 K
eﬀusive oven, with a thin oriﬁce [34], roughly 10−7 of the
atoms in a beam will be in the energy range from 0.89 K
to 1.1 K. ( About 4 × 10−7 of the atoms in a beam will
be within the energy range 3.60 K to 3.83 K.)

The ﬁnal velocity and the minimum length of the elec-
tric ﬁeld plates will determine repetition rate for slowing
packets of atoms. At the last ﬁeld plate section, where
the distance between pulses will be at a minimum, one
pulse of atoms must exit before the next pulse enters.
The total number of atoms that reach the end of the ap-
paratus thus depends on the ﬁnal velocity, the length of
the apparatus, the initial velocity, and on any focusing
available.

A method for focusing strong ﬁeld seeking atoms and
molecules using alternating electric ﬁeld gradients [35],
has been applied to molecular beams [36]. The range of
beam energies that can be accepted can also be increased
by using a design that cools over several electric ﬁeld

7

sections before slowing. We will discuss some of these
details in a future paper.

For clusters [15,37], the polarizability per atom of small
homonuclear alkali clusters is close to the atomic polar-
izability, and decreases to a value of about 0.4 times the
polarizability per atom for bulk samples [38]. It should
be possible to slow and cool clusters in the same way as
atoms.

We also note that the metastable states of noble
gases have dipole polarizabilities [14] that are of order
2
10 × 10−39J/(V/m)
. This would allow noble gas atoms
in the metastable states to be slowed and cooled, much
the same way as ground state (Cs) atoms. They do, how-
ever, have large tensor polarizabilities, that may permit
eﬀective slowing and cooling of only a single angular mo-
mentum state.

tric ﬁeld of 3.5 × 106 V/m that decays with a 5 ms time
constant.

3. Slowing Rydberg atoms

The properties of Rydberg atoms [39], atoms in states
of very high principle quantum number n, are similar
for all elements and include very large dipole polariz-
abilities [14], that can be either positive or negative.
This makes Rydberg states worth considering for slow-
ing atoms. Slowing of Rydberg atoms in inhomogeneous
electric ﬁelds was proposed by Breeden and Metcalf [40],
who analyzed the case of time independent inhomoge-
neous electric ﬁelds, and atoms in short-lived Rydberg
levels.

To slow Rydberg atoms using time-varying electric
ﬁeld gradients, a number of conditions must be met.
The lifetimes of the states must be long enough to pass
through the apparatus and the electric ﬁeld must neither
quench the state, nor or ionize the atom, but should still
be large enough to produce signiﬁcant slowing. The life-
time of a state in a quasi-hydrogenic Rydberg atom, with

8

principle quantum number n, and angular momentum l,
has been calculated by Chang [41], who ﬁnds for high
angular momentum, τ = 93n3(l + 0.5)2, where τ is the
lifetime in ps. For n = 30, the lifetimes are about 2.2 ms
for l = 29 and about 1.1 ms for l = 20. An external
electric ﬁeld mixes diﬀerent values of l having the same
z component of angular momentum m. Thus, only the
sublevels with large values of m will have unquenched
lifetimes, since the lower m states mix with low l states
that have much shorter lifetimes.

The critical electric ﬁeld for ionizing a Rydberg atom
is given classically as Ecr = 1/(16n4), where Ecr is in
atomic units (of 5.14 × 1011 V/m). High m states are
more circular and thus require a higher ﬁeld to ionize.
The Stark eﬀect also modiﬁes the critical ﬁeld [39] and
for blue shifted levels the critical ﬁeld may be closer to
1/(12n4).

The change in energy levels with the electric ﬁeld
has been calculated by Bethe and Salpeter [43]. For
a hydrogenic case they ﬁnd, in atomic units (1 au =
1.0973 × 107 m−1), W = −0.5n2 + 1.5En(n1 − n2) −
E2n4[17n2 − 3(n1 − n2)2 − 9m2 + 19]/16, where n1 and
n2 are parabolic quantum numbers that satisfy the equa-
tion n = n1 + n2 + |m| + 1. Setting E equal to 1/(12n4),
we ﬁnd that for n = 30, l = 20 the energy change at the
maximum ﬁeld, that does not ionize the atom, is about
5.6 K or 7.6 K, depending on whether the red or blue
shifted level is chosen. For the circular state, |m| = n − 1
and n1 = n2 = 0, the electric ﬁeld can not mix states
from the same n or lower n and the shift is much smaller.
For n = 30, l = 29, the maximum energy change before
ionization is about 0.66 K.

4. Slowing polar molecules

Time-varying electric ﬁeld gradient slowing and cool-
ing of polar molecules with large electric dipole moments
can be very eﬃcient. As examples we consider two lin-
ear diatomic molecules with large dipole moments: ce-
sium ﬂuoride, which has a small rotational constant, and
lithium hydride, which has a very large rotational con-
stant.

As discussed in section II, a rigid rotor model calcula-
tion [19] of CsF, in its lowest rotational state (J = m =
0), shows that CsF would lose about 16 K of energy ex-
iting each 107 V/m electric ﬁeld section. The next few
higher rotational levels (Fig. 10a) would also experience
large changes in kinetic energy and could be eﬃciently
slowed and cooled. With a 5 × 107 V/m electric ﬁeld, the
change in kinetic energy (see Fig. 10a), for the lowest
rotational level, would be about 89 K, or equivalently a
molecule traveling 98 m/s could be brought to rest. Lon-
gitudinal cooling, of about 89 K, could also be achieved
in a single time-varying electric ﬁeld gradient section.

In a thermal beam of CsF formed [44] at 850 K, about
one-half percent of the molecules have a kinetic energy

FIG. 9. Defocusing eﬀects for simple parallel- and splayed-electric ﬁeld plates. In (a) and (b) the schematics of the two electric
ﬁeld plate conﬁgurations are shown to the same scale, along with the lines of constant energy potential (E = −(1/2)αE2) for
Cs from an applied voltage of 40 kV. For comparison the interval corresponding to the force of gravity, labeled g, is shown in
(b). In the parallel plate conﬁguration (a) used for the measurements in this paper, the potential contours curve and atoms
not on the midplane acquire transverse velocities as they exit. In (b), the ﬁeld plates are splayed 15◦ from vertical producing a
potential minimum just above the bottom of the plates. On (b) the voltage would be applied once the atom packet, traveling
from below, has passed beyond the potential minimum. The contours further up are much ﬂatter than in (a), and the defocusing
is considerably less. The resulting transverse velocity for an initial longitudinal velocity of 2 m/s is shown in (c). The dashed
line corresponds to the simple parallel plates in (a) and the solid line corresponds to the splayed plates in (b).

of 89 K or less. A disadvantage of using a thermal beam
of molecules with a small rotational constant is that only
a very small fraction of the molecules are found in any
single rotational state. Only about one in 15,000 CsF
molecules are found in the J = m = 0 state in a thermal
molecular beam at this temperature [44].

An alternative approach is to form a supersonic beam
[45] of CsF. The supersonic beam has a much lower inter-
nal temperature, which greatly increases the population
of low rotational levels, and it is a very directional beam
with a narrow velocity distribution. However, the beam
velocity of a supersonic source is higher than the most
probable velocity from an eﬀusive source of the same
temperature and has no low velocity tail. Slowing a su-
personic CsF beam would require approximately twenty
electric ﬁeld sections – still very doable.

Lithium hydride and other metal hydrides have both
very large rotational constants and large dipole mo-
ments. For LiH, Be = 11 K (7.5 cm−1) and de = 2.0 ×
10−29 J/(V/m) (5.9 Debye) [21,20]. Even at 5×107 V/m,
the electric ﬁeld does not completely suppress rotation
(Fig. 10b), and for the m = 0, J 6= 0 states, the interac-
tion energy is both large and positive. As shown in Fig.
10b, a LiH molecule in the J = 1, m = 0 state enter-
ing an electric ﬁeld of 3.5 × 107 V/m would lose about
7 K of energy. And since the rotation constant is large,
a signiﬁcant fraction of the molecules in a thermal beam
are in low rotation states. Approximately 2 × 10−5 of the
LiH molecules in a beam from a1200 K eﬀusive oven will
have an energy of 7 K or less. Those in the J = 1, m = 0

state could be slowed to rest with a single electric ﬁeld
section.

Lithium hydride in the low-lying m = 0, J 6= 0 states
and other molecular states that have positive interaction
energies are weak ﬁeld seeking and can be transversely
focused by static multipole electric ﬁelds [46]. (For focus-
ing strong ﬁeld seeking states see Ref. [35,36]). It may
also be possible to trap weak ﬁeld seeking states in elec-
tric ﬁeld traps [7–10,12] or a laser trap [11]. An electric
ﬁeld trap could, in principle, be up to 7.5 K deep for the
J = 1, m = 0 state of LiH, depending on the electric ﬁeld
that can be sustained in the trap geometry.

The J = 1, m = 0 and J = 2, m = 0 rotational levels of
CsF have negative interaction energies at strong electric
ﬁelds, but positive interaction energies at weaker ﬁelds
(Fig.10a). Thus, CsF in these states could be eﬃciently
slowed using strong electric ﬁeld gradients, then focused
and trapped in a weaker electric ﬁeld. The change in
kinetic energy exiting a 5 × 107 V/m electric ﬁeld would
be 82 K (74 K) for the J = 1, m = 0 (J = 2, m = 0) state,
while in an electric ﬁeld of 2.5 × 106 V/m (4 × 106 V/m)
the J = 1, m = 0 (J = 2, m = 0) state would be weak
ﬁeld seeking with an interaction energy of 0.5 K (1 K).
Alternatively, CsF could be slowed in the J = 1, m = 1
state and then, in a weak electric ﬁeld, transferred to the
J = 1, m = 0 state, by an rf transition [44].

1. Measurement of the ground state dipole polarizability of
atoms

Fig. 5 demonstrates the sensitivity of time-varying
electric ﬁeld gradient slowing to the static dipole polariz-
ability. Each data point in this ﬁgure represents less than
300 seconds of counting. Key quantities in a time-varying
electric ﬁeld gradient measurement of dipole polarizabil-
ities are the electric ﬁeld strength, the beam velocities,
and the electric ﬁeld proﬁle at the plate exit and/or en-
trance. The ﬁeld proﬁle is needed to determine the drift
lengths before and after slowing for a time-of- ﬂight veloc-
ity measurement. We expect that with a moderate eﬀort,
polarizability measurements on alkali, alkaline earth and
other slow, cold atoms can be made to an accuracy of a
few parts per thousand [47].

Although dipole polarizability is related to many im-
portant physical and chemical properties [17], the ground
state dipole polarizability has been measured in fewer
than 20 percent of the known elements [17]. And of these,
only for the noble gasses and sodium [48] has an accu-
racy of one percent been surpassed [17]. The traditional
method for measuring the static dipole polarizabilities of

10

condensible atoms is the elegant electric-magnetic ﬁeld
gradient balance technique (E-H balance) [14,49], which
uses thermal beams of atoms. Slow, cold atoms would
also allow a signiﬁcantly improved accuracy for E-H bal-
ance and other deﬂection based methods. However, we
anticipate that time-varying electric ﬁeld gradient slow-
ing (or acceleration) will be easier to perform and poses
fewer challenges to understanding the distributions of
electric ﬁeld and atoms.

2. Beam transport

Inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds are used for transverse
focusing of laser-cooled atom packets [50], and Cornell,
Monroe, and Wieman [51] have used time varying in-
homogeneous magnetic ﬁelds to radially and axially fo-
cus atoms being transferred between traps. Time-varying
electric ﬁeld gradients are a useful compliment to these
atom optic elements because they are insensitive to the
magnetic or hyperﬁne substates, and when edge eﬀects
are small or absent, they control only in the longitudinal
direction.

One possible application of the time-varying electric
is to longitudinally
ﬁeld gradient to beam transport,
spread atoms in a cold Cs atom atomic clock, to re-
duce collisional frequency shifts [52]. In such a clock, the
atoms would be spread before they passed through the
ﬁrst rf region (or the ﬁrst passage through the single rf re-
gion in a fountain clock) and, if necessary, to sharpen the
detection signal, rebunched after they passed through the
second rf region (after their return through the rf region
in a fountain clock) . The magnetic ﬁelds associated with
turning on and oﬀ the electric ﬁeld can be made small so
as not to inﬂuence the magnetic shielding environment
of the clock.

3. Launching atoms

If a set of electric ﬁeld plates is turned on near a cloud
of cold conﬁned atoms in the ground state, the atoms
will accelerate into the plates. Turning oﬀ the ﬁeld when
the atoms are in the uniform ﬁeld region then allows the
atoms to exit the plates with a net velocity. Cesium
atoms entering an electric ﬁeld of 4 × 107 V/m will ac-
celerate from rest to 6.8 m/s.

The electric ﬁeld plates can be positioned to launch
atoms in any direction. To launch horizontally, a vertical
gap will provide a fringe ﬁeld at the bottom that can help
keep the atoms from falling out of the plates. To launch
vertically, the electric ﬁeld gradient at the initial loca-
tion of the atoms needs to be large enough to overcome
gravity.
In microgravity, the initial acceleration needs
only to be large enough that the cloud of atoms does not
expand beyond the dimensions of the electric ﬁeld plate
gap (to prevent the loss of atoms). It would also be easy

to vary the launch velocity and direction. One possible
arrangement of electric ﬁeld plates is to invert the plate
conﬁguration shown in Fig. 9.

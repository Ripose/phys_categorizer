Abstract

A review of the research on electron and ion transport in dense
rare gases is presented. The investigation of the transport properties
of electrons in dense rare gases aims at understanding the dynamics
and energetics of electron states in a dense medium and at elucidating
how changes of the environment inﬂuence their nature and scattering
properties. The quantum nature of electrons couples them to the en-
vironment is such a way to produce a density-dependent shift of their
energy that is the key to rationalize the observed phenomena.

Introduction

The conduction of excess electrons in non polar dielectric liquids is a topic of
practical and fundamental relevance. For example, the drift of electrons in
liqueﬁed noble gases is the working principle of ionizing radiation detectors,
which are routinely used in high-energy physics. Thus, the design of many
industrial and research apparatuses requires the knowledge of the transport
properties of excess electrons in dielectric media. Signiﬁcant pieces of in-
formation on the fundamental electron-atom scattering processes in a dense
medium is gathered by investigating electron transport carefully [1, 2].

of the electric ﬁeld [5].

In particular, liquid rare gases are the simplest possible systems. Their
atoms are approximately spherically symmetric and have quite large ioniza-
tion energies so that ionization processes do not contribute signiﬁcantly at
the small energies typically involved in transport experiments. Rare gases
are extremely well characterized: the electron-atom cross sections are well
known [3] as are their equations of state. Finally, most important from the
experimental point of view, samples of compressed or liqueﬁed noble gases
of extremely high purity can be quite easily produced.

Typically, swarm techniques are used to study electrons transport [1].
In the simplest experiments, electrons injected into the liquid under investi-
gation are drifted through it by applying a suitable uniform electric ﬁeld E
across two plane and parallel electrodes. The analysis of the signal induced
at the collector allows to determine the drift time and hence the drift veloc-
ity vD. According to classic kinetic theory [4], it is customary to calculate
the electron mobility µ = vDE because it is directly related to the scattering
cross section.

As an example, the electron mobility µ measured in liquid Ar at the
normal boiling point for T = 87.3 K and P = 0.1 MPa, is shown in Figure 1
as a function of the externally applied electric ﬁeld E. It is interesting to note
that the ﬁeld dependence of the electron mobility in the cryogenic liquid is
similar to that of an electron in a dilute hard–sphere gas. For this reason, a

2

gas–kinetic approach has been adopted to describe the experimental results
[5, 6].

According to standard kinetic theory [4, 7] µ is related to the scattering

cross section by the following relationship

Finally, σE(ǫ) is the energy-transfer cross section.

An accurate description of the experimental data is obtained by assum-
ing σmt(ǫ) = σm0 = constant and σE(ǫ) = σE0πkBT /ǫ, where kB is the
Boltzmann constant. σm0 and σE0 are adjusted so as to ﬁt the data as
shown in Figure 1, in which the solid line is obtained by letting σm0 = 0.213
˚A2 and σE0 = 10 ˚A2 [5].

The agreement of the gas-kinetic model with the experiment in a liquid
raises the question of how the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation
can be successfully used in a dense environment.

At ﬁrst glance, one immediately realizes that the cross sections in equa-
tions 1 and 2 are adjustable parameters, whereas the cross sections in dilute
gas systems are given either theoretically from an electron-atom interaction
potential or experimentally from swarm- or beam experiments [3].

It is clear that, as the gas density is increased from dilute values, the
interatomic distance decreases and the quantum nature of the electron can-
not be neglected anymore, especially at low temperature. The electron wave
packet interacts simultaneously with many atoms at once and several mul-
tiple scattering eﬀects come into play.

3

The eﬀects of the environmental changes can be summarized by intro-
ducing a density-dependent shift of the ground state electron energy and a
density-dependent modiﬁcation of the cross sections that progressively go
away from their gas-phase values to rather become eﬀective cross sections
[8].

The investigation of the electron dynamics and energetics of electrons
in dense gases as a function of the gas density is thus aimed at following
the transition from true- to eﬀective-cross sections that allows to retain the
gas-kinetic picture even in the liquid.

This paper summarizes the experimental results on electron transport
in dense noble gases and on some other properties of electrons in such an
environment, which yield a consistent picture of the states of excess electrons
in a dense medium.

2 Transport properties

The attention of this paper is focused on dense rare gases because they are
the simplest systems. Their atoms are spherical symmetric, their interaction
with electrons is well known and there is a plenty of information about their
cross sections [3]. These facts make rare gases the best systems to elucidate
the basic physical mechanisms that determine transport.

In the limit of vanishingly small electric ﬁeld,E = 0, kinetic theory pre-
dicts that the density-normalized mobility m0N of electrons in a gas at
constant temperature T is independent of the density N [4]. This result as
can easily obtained by carrying out the integrations in equations 1 through
3.

In Figure 2 experimental results obtained for the zero-ﬁeld density-
normalized mobility µ0N in He, Ne, Ar, and Xe are shown [8, 9, 10, 13, 14].
Constant lines in the picture indicate the predictions of kinetic theory that
are strongly violated in real experiments.

The reduced mobility in He and Ne decreases by more than 4 orders of
magnitude as N is increased up to values comparable or larger than the
liquid density at the critical point. On the contrary, µ0N in Ar increases
up to a value nearly 30 times larger than the low-density value, whereas Xe
shows a feeble drop at ﬁrst and then a nearly 3 orders-of-magnitude increase
with increasing N before its mobility drops again at even larger density.

Whereas the mobility measurements in He [9], Ne [14, 10], and Ar [11, 12]
have been carried out along isotherms, the Xe results have been obtained
In this way, the temperature T is not
at saturated vapor pressure [13].

constant for all N and the analysis is more complicated than for He, Ne,
and Ar, although the conclusions are the same.

In a more expanded picture (see Figure 3), deviations of the data from
the predictions of kinetic theory appear even at the lowest densities. The
positive (Ar [11]) and negative (Ne [14]) deviations from the kinetic predic-
tions are shown for low– to intermediate N.

As a general rule, the mobility in gases of small polarizability (He and
Ne) shows negative deviations. More polarizable gases (Ar and the heavier
noble gases) show positive deviations.

The electron-atom interaction in He and Ne is actually dominated by
short-range repulsive exchange forces and is characterized by a positive scat-
tering length. On the contrary, the interaction between low-energy excess
electrons and the atoms of the heavier noble gases is mainly due to long-
range polarization forces and the scattering length is negative [3].

Ne [14]] and He [9, 15] show a further dramatic decrease of the mobil-
ity at high density until µ0N levels oﬀ at very small values, as shown in
Figure 2. This drop is commonly associated to self–trapping of electrons in

6

m
(partially) empty cavities, known as bubbles [16], endowed with very small
hydrodynamic mobility, whose existence has been reported for the ﬁrst time
in superﬂuid He [17]. The smooth transition to low mobility values observed
in Figure 2 depends on the fact that the observed mobility is an average over
extended, highly mobile– and localized, low–mobility states.

The behavior of the transport properties of electrons must be thus an-
alyzed in a ﬁrst region up to intermediate N values, in which the electron
transport proceeds via extended states, and in a second region for higher
N, in which the coupling between electron and environment leads to the
formation of a new kind of states.

2.1 Transport up to intermediate density

The basic assumption of kinetic theory is that the density of scatterers is so
low that only binary collisions take place. The electron mean free path ℓ,
the atomic size d, the average interatomic distance N −1/3, and the electron
thermal wavelength λT must satisfy the inequalities ℓ ≫ N −1/3 > d and
ℓ ≫ λT . In this case, the two-terms solution of the Boltzmann transport
equation yields equations (1) and (2) [4, 7]. However, if the last condition
is not met, multiple scattering eﬀects come into play [18, 19].

Several theories have been developed in order to explain the positive
and negative density eﬀects in terms of the sign of the scattering length.
However, a uniﬁed picture of the scattering mechanisms in a dense gas can
be heuristically developed [19].

It is known that electrons injected into liquid He must overcome a 1–
eV–high barrier [20]. This means that, in a liquid, the average electron
energy is diﬀerent from (3/2)kBT. It is also known that the spectral lines of
alkali atoms in a buﬀer noble gas show a density-dependent shift, which is
interpreted in terms of multiple scattering [21].

According to Springett, Cohen, and Jortner [22] the energy spectrum of

an excess electron in a monoatomic ﬂuid takes the form

which expresses the fact that the bottom of the conduction band is shifted
with respect to vacuum by the density-dependent contribution

UP (N ) is a potential energy term that takes into account the eﬀect of the
polarization of the medium. EK(N ) is a kinetic energy term related to the

quantum nature of the electron. It can be calculated by assuming that in
the ﬂuid there is a short-range order on the scale of the Wigner-Seitz radius
rs = (3/4N )1/3 and by imposing the the condition that the electron wave
function is invariant under a translation of 2rs : ψ(r) = ψ(r + 2rs). For
low-energy electrons of wave vector k0, the following eigenvalue equation is
obtained [22]

tan [k0 (rs − ˜a (k0))] = k0rs
˜a = (σT /4π)1/2 is the positive scattering length of the hard-core repulsive
electron-atom pseudopotential and has the meaning of an eﬀective atomic
radius [21]. σT is the total cross section. The kinetic energy shift EK is
obtained as

Only EK aﬀects the dynamical properties of the electrons. The group veloc-
ity contributes to the equipartition value arising from the gas temperature.
The bottom of the energy distribution function is shifted by EK .

This fact explains to a large extent the density dependence of the mo-
bility µ0, if the energy dependence of the momentum-transfer cross section
of the diﬀerent gases is considered (see Figure 4).

µ0N is a sort of average of the inverse momentum transfer cross section.
If the distribution function is shifted by the positive, density-dependent
contribution EK(N ), the cross section is sampled at an increasingly higher
mean energy. Thus, the mobility decreases if the cross section increases with
the energy and, conversely, it decreases if the cross section increases with
energy.

This eﬀect is small for He, for which smt is nearly constant and is very
large for Ne and Ar, whose cross sections depend strongly on the electron
energy. In Ne, a positive N −dependent energy shift increases the average
cross section, thereby reducing µ0 [14]. The opposite eﬀect occurs in Ar, as
shown in Figure 3 [8, 12].

The fact that the energy shift EK is positive can be deduced by the
analysis of the ﬁeld dependence of the mobility µ in Ar, for instance. In
Figure 5 the density-normalized mobility µN is shown as a function of the
reduced electric ﬁeld E/N in Ar at T = 162.7 K for several densities (0.37 <
N < 6.1 atoms/nm3) [8].

In correspondence of the ﬁeld (E/N )max, at which the mobility is max-
imum for each N, the average electron energy equals that of the RT–mini-
mum. (E/N )max decreases with increasing N at constant T, as shown in
Figure 6.

Because the quantity (E/N ) is proportional to the energy gained by elec-
trons from the ﬁeld in a mean free path, the conclusion is drawn that, upon
increasing N, electrons need a smaller contribution from the ﬁeld in order
that their average energy equals that of the RT minimum. This positive
contribution is EK(N ) [8].

In He, whose cross section is large but nearly constant, the previous
eﬀect is less important. In this case, another multiple scattering eﬀect is
more eﬀective because the cross section is so large.

When N increases, the electron mean free path decreases accordingly as
1/N σ and it may eventually become comparable to its thermal de Broglie
wavelength. In this case, there is an enhancement of electron backscattering
due to quantum self-interference of the electron wave function scattered oﬀ
atoms located along paths that are connected by time-reversal symmetry.
This phenomenon is closely related to the weak localization regime of the
conduction in disordered solids and to the Anderson localization. It depends

and contributes most for large cross-section atoms.

For low N, cross sections are increased by a factor 1 + N σmtλ/π [23].
At very high density, this factor leads to the appearance of a mobility edge
[24].

A ﬁnal multiple scattering eﬀect is related to the fact that, at highN, the
electron wave function spans a large region including many atoms. The total
scattered wave function is thus a coherent sum of partial contributions scat-
tered oﬀ each individual atoms [25]. The correlation among atoms, which
is particularly strong near the critical point, yields a further enhancement
of the cross section by a wave vector dependent factor F (k), which can be
accounted for once the static structure factor S(k) is known

where the long–range correlation length is given by L2 = 0.1l2[S(0) − 1],
and l = 10 ˚A is the short–range correlation length. S(0) = N kBT KT is the
long wavelength limit of the static structure factor and KT is the isothermal
compressibility.

where w = ǫ + EK(N ) is the shifted energy [8, 12, 14]. The cross section is
evaluated at the shifted energy and is enhanced by the weak localization- and
correlation factors. The eﬀective cross section is then inserted in equations
1 and 2 with the results shown in Figures 6, 7, and 8.

In Figure 7 the values ofEK to be inserted in equation 11 in order to
obtain agreement between the heuristic model and the experimental deter-
mination of µ0N in Ar at T = 162.7 K are compared with the predictions
of equations 6 and 7 [8]. The model appears to be highly consistent.

A further conﬁrmation of the self-consistency of this heuristic model is its
ability to predict with fair accuracy the density dependence of the quantity
(E/N )max, as shown in Figure 6 [8].

The model works equally well also for negative-density-eﬀect gases. In
Figure 8, the zero-ﬁeld mobilityµ0 in Ne at T = 45 K is compared with the
predictions of the model, represented by a solid line.
In this case, EK is
calculated from equations 6 and 7 with the experimental cross section and
this result is used to calculate the mobility [10, 14].

The initial 3 orders-of-magnitude decrease of µ0 is well described up to
N = 10.5 atoms/nm3, where electron self-trapping begins [10]. This result
shows that the kinetic picture remains valid up to very high N, if the gas-
phase cross section is turned into an eﬀective one by the multiple scattering
eﬀect.

2.2 Localization at high density

At very high N in repulsive gases such as He and Ne, the kinetic description
of the mobility fails, as shown in Figure 8, because a diﬀerent physical
phenomenon sets in: electron self-trapping [16].

The interaction of an excess electron with the atoms of these gases is
mainly repulsive and V0(N ) > 0. The electrons may lower their free energy
by trapping themselves in lower–than–average density ﬂuctuations. If the
local density Ni in the ﬂuctuation is small enough, the decrease V0(N ) −
V0(Ni) compensates the increase of kinetic energy of the trapped electron
due to localization and to the work spent to expand the cavity [10, 16]. At

than a given threshold, as can be observed in Figure 8, in which the mobility
in Ne for T = 45.0 K shows an enhanced slope around N = 10.5 atoms/nm3
citeborg90.

The threshold density increases with increasing T, mainly because of
the large increase of the cavity expansion work as a consequence of the su-
perlinear increase of pressure. This behavior is shown for He for several
temperatures in Figure 9 [9, 15, 27]. The localization-delocalization transi-
tion shifts to higher N as T is increased.

Although the dynamics of bubble formation is not completely understood
yet [28, 29], the very simple quantum mechanical model of a particle in a
spherically symmetric square box can grasp the essential physical features
of localization [9, 10].

The well depth is related toN by means of V0(N ). The well is not com-
pletely empty because, for not too low T, the atoms have suﬃcient en-
ergy to penetrate into the cavity. Thus, the net well depth is actually
V0(N ) − V0(Ni), where Ni is the density of atoms inside the bubble. Basic
Quantum Mechanics is used to solve for the energy eigenvalue of the ground
state of the electron in the bubble, although more reﬁned self-consistent
model can be used [16]. The same approach has been used to interpret the

results of infrared absorption of electron bubbles in liquid helium [30].

The free energy is readily calculated and the excess free energy is mini-
mized with respect to bubble radius and ﬁlling fraction in order to give the
most probable state.

In Figure 10 the computed minimum excess-free energy ∆F of electrons
in dense Helium gas is shown as a function of density for several tempera-
tures. We note that the density at which ∆F = 0, i.e., the density at which
the extended and localized states are equiprobable, shifts to larger values as
the temperature is increased, in fair agreement with the expected behavior.
Similar results are obtained also for Ne [10].

The mobility µ is then calculated as a weighted sum of that of the free
electron, computed with the heuristic model described previously, and that
of the localized state that is given by standard hydrodynamics because of the
large size and eﬀective mass of the electron bubble. The equilibrium fraction
of free to localized states is easily computed as nF /nB = exp(−∆F/kBT ),
where ∆F is the minimum excess free energy. The dashed line in Figure 8
gives an example of the results.

This simple localization model describes qualitatively well the exper-
imental observations, including, for instance, the shift of the localization
threshold with increasing T. The agreement with the absolute mobility val-
ues is, however, quite poor, mainly because the physical problem cannot be

reduced to a two-species problem, the free and the optimum localized state.
Probably, there is a whole distribution of bubbles of diﬀerent radii, which
diﬀerently contribute to the average mobility. However, the basic physics of
localization is reasonably well explained.

2.3 Mobility maximum in very dense Argon

In an attractive gas, such as Ar, the situation at very high density is quite
diﬀerent with respect to the case of repulsive gases. Apparently, electron
localization might occur in a larger-than-average density ﬂuctuation, owing
to the negative value of V0(N ). As a matter of fact, however, this does not
happen because, even at close packing, the excess free energy is not large
and negative enough.

In spite of this, the behavior of the electron mobility in dense Ar is very
interesting. In Figure 11 the zero-ﬁeld density-normalized mobility µ0N is
shown as a function of the density for T = 151.5 K, just a few tenths of a
degree above the critical temperature Tc = 150.9 K [12].

The mobility in the dense gas shows a very pronounced peak at the
very same density, at which a similar maximum is observed in liquid Ar at
coexistence [31]. The peak in the gas can be somehow related to the RT
minimum in the cross section [12], thus indicating that the RT minimum is

3 Resonant electron attachment to O2

Another interesting phenomenon, which is intimately related to the existence
of a N −dependent contribution to the ground-state energy of an electron
in a dense medium, is the resonant attachment of electrons to O2 molecular
impurities in a gas.

The study of attachment may be considered as a non-conventional way
to carry out molecular spectroscopy in dense gases [16]. The electron at-
tachment mechanism is the well-known Bloch–Bradbury one [33]. O2 has an
electron aﬃnity of 0.46 eV. In a ﬁrst step, an unstable negative ion is formed
−∗
in a vibrational excited state, O
2 . Then, the excess energy is carried away
by a stabilizing collision with an atom of the host gas, as summarized in the
following scheme

O2 + e → O
−⋆
2 + M → O

O

−⋆
2
−
2 + M

(12)

where M represents one atom of the host gas. A scheme of the energy

curves involved in the process is reported in Figure 12.

In vacuo, the energies the energies of the two ﬁrst accessible vibrational
levels, namely those with v′ = 4 and v′ = 5, respectively, on averaging over
the spin-orbit split doublets, are E(4)
R = 207 meV above the
ground state of the neutral molecule.

R = 91 and E(5)

Once stabilized, ions are then detected in a traditional drift experiment.
The current due to drifting electron decreases exponentially in time due to
the formation of the very slow ions. An analysis of the current waveform
gives electron lifetime, whose inverse is the attachment frequency νA. In
Figure 13 the reduced attachment frequency νA/N is shown as a function
of N for He, Ne, and Ar [34]. Strong peaks appear for He and Ne, while no
structure is present in Ar.

It can be shown that the density-normalized attachment frequency is
νA/N ∝ F (ER), where F (ER) is the electron energy distribution function
evaluated at the resonance energy [35]. If the excess electron ground state
energy were unaﬀected by density, νA/N should be independent of N. The
existence of attachment peaks in He and Ne for a density N = NR is easily
explained by noting that V0(N ) > 0 for these gases. An increase of N shifts
the bottom of the electron energy distribution function that is sampled by

the attachment process at the ﬁxed energy ER. This process is schematically
depicted in Figure 14.

Actually, in a dense gas, whose electron-atom interaction is repulsive, a
partially empty cavity is formed around the ion and the condition for energy
conservation at resonance must include the excess free energy spent to create
the bubble. In any case, at the density NR of the peak the mean electron
energy equals the resonance energy. The peaks are thus a sort of replica
ofF (ǫ).

At even higher N, the shift in energy of the distribution becomes even-
tually so large that attachment to the second accessible vibrational level of
O

−
2 can take place and a second peak appears [34].

In Ar no such structures exist because the polarization contribution to
V0(N ) is so large as to make it negative and because the polarization energy
of the ion cannot be neglected.
In this case the average electron energy
is shifted downwards, in the direction of the lower lying vibrational levels
of the molecular ion (v′ = 2, for instance), but these levels are also shifted
downwards by nearly the same amount because of the ion polarization energy
in such a way that the condition for resonance is never met.

It has to be noted, that, at variance with the scattering processes in-
volved in the mobility experiments, in which the electron kinetic energy is
shifted only by the positive amount EK (N ) both in repulsive as well as in
attractive gases, the total energy shift V0(N ) must be taken into account for
energy conservation in the resonant electron attachment process

2 Transport at high density

The negative O
2 molecular ion formed by electron attachment has a complex
structure because of both electrostriction and quantum exchange forces. An
electrostriction–induced solvation shell surrounds the ion [36]. Owing to the
symmetry of the polarization potential, the ion-solvation shell complex can
be assumed to be a sphere with a several large radius.

It easy to show that the local density proﬁle N(r) is given by [36, 11]

density proﬁle surrounding the negative oxygen ions in Ar for T = 151.5 K
is shown in Figure 15.

Owing to its large size, the ion can be thus used as a probe to investigate
the transition between the hydrodynamic transport regime, typical of the
liquid, and the kinetic regime, typical of the dilute gas.

In Figure 6 the measured zero-ﬁeld density-normalized mobility of the

2 ion in Ar gas at T = 151.5 K is shown [11]. The critical parameters of
Ar are Tc = 150.86 K and Nc = 8.08 atoms nm−3. The experimental data
show a deep drop of µN at N = 6.25 atoms/nm3 < Nc.

Classical hydrodynamics predicts that m is related to the gas viscosity

η by means of the Stokes formula

(14)

where R is the ion eﬀective hydrodynamic radius. The dash–dotted line in
Figure 16 represents the prediction of the Stokes formula with a reasonable
choice of the ion radius, R = 0.58 nm [11]. Only at the highest N, equation
14 approaches the experimental data but it does not reproduce at all the
experiment for N ≈ Nc. Similar behavior is observed also in Ne [37].

2 mobility in Ar at T = 151.5 K [11]. Dash–dotted line:
Stokes mobility. Solid line: Stokes formula modiﬁed by electrostriction and criti-
cality.

The hydrodynamic prediction can be reconciled with the data if elec-
trostriction in a near-critical ﬂuid is considered. Electrostriction induces a
local density and viscosity enhancement around the ion. Criticality makes
a local long-range order to appear in the gas. A thick layer of strongly
correlated ﬂuid is this dragged along by the ion. In this way the eﬀective
hydrodynamic ion radius depends on how close criticality is approached.

Near the critical point, the correlation length ξ is the longest and the
eﬀective ion radius is the largest. Because of electrostriction, however, criti-
cality in the ﬂuid surrounding the ion is attained at a given distance from the
ion only when the unperturbed ﬂuid at large distance is below the critical
density. This explains why the mobility drop occurs for N < Nc.

A simple model has been developed to account for electrostriction and
criticality [11]. The eﬀective ion hydrodynamic radius in 14 is assumed to
be given by

Re = b0 + b1N + b2ξ (N (r))

(15)

where b0, b1, and b2 are adjustable parameters. ξ (N (r)) is the local value of
the correlation length of the ﬂuid. ξ(N (r) ∝
S(N (r)) [26], where S(N (r))
is the long wavelength limit of the static structure factor evaluated as a
function of the local density at a given distance r from the ion. The linear
contribution b0 + b1N interpolates between the radii of the ﬁrst and second

p

22

m
solvation shells, which appear at high N even far from the critical point.

The distance, at which the static structure factor is to be evaluated,
must be chosen so as to reproduce the experimental mobility minimum. If
r = r⋆ = 1.85 nm is chosen, and if also the local value of the viscosity is
used in equation 14, the electrostriction-modiﬁed Stokes formula agrees very
nicely with the data, as shown by the solid line in Figure 16.

For N < 4 atoms nm−3, in any case, hydrodynamics is no longer valid
and the modiﬁed Stokes formula fails to reproduce the data, even though N
is still too large for kinetic theory to apply.

5 Red–shift of infrared excimer ﬂuorescence in a

dense gas

The unifying concept of the previously reported phenomena is the N −de-
pendent shift of the ground state energy of a free electron in a dense gas.
The same concept explains the experimental results in a diﬀerent situation,
in which the electron is not free but it is bound to a molecule.

In a noble gas, such as Xe, excited by means of energetic electrons,
transient excited molecular species or excimers, such as Xe2, are formed.
The ground state of this molecule is dissociative but higher lying states may
be bound [38].

In the deexcitation path leading again to two neutral atoms, the transi-
tion from the ﬁrst excited level of the excimer to its ground state is the most
energetic and leads typically to vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) ﬂuorescence. In
Xe, this occurs at 173 nm and is exploited to detect ionizing particles. In
the context of high-energy physics, ﬂuorescence is termed scintillation [39].
A broad band of near infrared (NIR) ﬂuorescence of Xe2 in pure Xe
gas and in Ar-Xe gas mixture has been recently discovered [40]. It occurs
around 7.9 × 105 m−1, corresponding to a transition energy of nearly 1 eV.
The ﬂuorescence thus involves a less energetic transition between higher
lying excimer levels.

The most important feature of this NIR band is that its center is red-
shifted if the gas density is increased. The shift in pure Xe is larger than in
the 90% Ar–10% Xe mixture, as shown in Figure 17.

The experimental results are easily explained if the excimer is modeled
as consisting of an ionic Xe+
2 core plus a delocalized electron in a Rydberg–
like state of very large radius. The electron interacts with many atoms of
the host gas simultaneously.

As a consequence, its energy is shifted by V0(N ), as in the case of the free

where a is the electron–atom scattering length.

Moreover, the orbit encompasses many atoms of the gas, which screen
the Coulomb interaction between the electron and the ionic core. This eﬀect
is a solvation eﬀect that always redshifts the wavelengths emitted in the
transitions.
It can be shown that, for not too large N, the central wave
number of the NIR ﬂuorescence can be written as [40]

where λ
m,0 is the wave number of the center of the band in the zero–density

is the solvation contribution that always produces a red–shift of the band.
The second term is due to the shift of the ground state energy of the
electron in a dense medium because of its quantum nature. Depending

(16)

(17)

on whether a is positive or negative, it reduces or enhances the red–shift
produced by solvation. In the case of Xe and Ar, a < 0. In the mixture,
the Xe2 excimers are surrounded, on average, by Ar atoms, so that the
parameters a and α of Ar have to be used, which yield a slope smaller than
for pure Xe.

Equation 17 predicts a linear dependence of the shift of the center of the
band, as experimentally observed. In Figure 17 the lines through the data
point are calculated by using this equation. The agreement is very good
[40]].

6 Conclusions

The investigation of the transport properties of excess electrons in dense
non-polar gases has produced a large wealth of data that gives a uniﬁed
picture of the electron states and dynamics in a dense host.

At high densities, quantum eﬀects of the electron–atom interaction in
a dense environment come into play. The most important phenomenon is
that the ground state energy of the excess electrons do now depend on
the density of the gas. This eﬀect modiﬁes all the dynamic properties of
electrons. In particular, the gas–phase cross section is progressively turned
into an eﬀective, density-dependent one as the density is increased. This is
the way, along which the conduction properties of dense liquids might be
bridged to the properties of dilute gas.

It is interesting to realize that the results of the analysis of the trans-
port properties shed light also on apparently uncorrelated phenomena, such

this concept could be helpful in understanding other phenomena, such as
electron–ion recombination in a dense gas.

It is clear that these results have been obtained for noble gases, which
are the simplest possible systems, and, under this respect, they are paradig-
matic. An interesting future goal might be to see if measurements in more
complex systems, such as molecular gases, for instance, may ﬁt into the
uniﬁed scheme emerging from noble gases.

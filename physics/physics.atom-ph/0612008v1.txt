We report that the solids with narrow valence bands cannot be described by the local density
approximation with the gradient corrections in the density functional theory as well as the Xα
method. In particular, in the case of completely ﬁlled valence bands, the work function is signiﬁcantly
underestimated by these methods for such types of solids. Also, we ﬁgured out that these deﬁciencies
cannot be cured by the self-interaction-corrected-local-density-approximation method.

INTRODUCTION

The density functional theory [1, 2] with the general-
ized gradient approximations [3, 4] (GGA) and the Xα
theory [5, 6] have been quite successful in the calcula-
tion of various properties in many systems[7], such as
the bond length, the bond angle, various properties re-
lated to the charge density and the vibration frequencies
of many moleculars and solids. Moreover, the binding
energies of many moleculars and the cohesive energies of
many solids can be as well roughly evaluated by the GGA
and the Xα theory.

Despite those successes, it is also well known[8] that the
single particle electronic structure cannot be very well de-
scribed by the GGA in many solids, since the GGA tends
to underestimate the valence band width and the band
gap. This is not diﬃcult to understand because even
in the electron gas model, the exchange energies for the
states far below or far above the Fermi surface are sig-
niﬁcantly underestimated or overestimated, respectively.
Nevertheless, the exchange energy for the states at the
Fermi level is correctly given by the GGA for the electron
gas case. Therefore, the properties related to the elec-
tronic structure at the Fermi surface, for instance, the
work function, has been considered correctly explained
by the GGA for many solids.

On the other hand, the eigenvalues of the Xα single
electron equation cannot be used to estimate the ioniza-
tion energies of atoms and small moleculars. Fortunately,
this problem can be cured by introducing the so called
transition state method[5].

Let us consider the solids in which the valence elec-
tronic states deviates from the plane waves signiﬁcantly.
The electronic properties of this type of solids cannot be
described by the electron gas model. In contrast, some
characters of the individual atom or small molecular are
still kept in such solids. But since the single particle
states are quite extended in crystalline solids, the tran-
sition state method will no longer be helpful. Hence, a
natural question is addressed: can the GGA or the Xα

method correctly describe the single particle states near
the Fermi surface for such type of solids? We ﬁgured out
that the answer to this question, unfortunately, is nega-
tive from both the academic and practical point of view.
Our paper will provide enough evidence to support this
conclusion.

In this paper, we study a system composed of spin
polarized hydrogen atoms being located on a cubic lat-
tice. The reason to choose such system is for simplicity.
Since the spins of all electrons are parallel, the correla-
tion energy is insigniﬁcant, and actually is zero in the
case of large lattice constant. The exchange energy can
be treated exactly by the Hartree Fock method. Also the
exchange functional in the GGA and the Xα method is
simple and the correlation functional is negligibly small
in this system.

In section III, we consider the large a case in which
the overlap of the localized hydrogen electron wavefunc-
tions on diﬀerent sites is negligible. We rigorously show
that in GGA or in Xα method, the ionization energy in
such case is given by the eigenvalue of the single particle
equation for one hydrogen atom which is roughly[9] 0.29
37/a4
and deviates from the exact ionization energy 0.5
considerably (Note that here the term 37/a4 is the hole
polarization term.). This diﬀerence, as we can see, is
present not only in the spin polarized hydrogen solids,
but also in many other systems, where atoms are well
separated and the single particle wavefunctions are ex-
tended. Notice here that the total bulk energy can be
still correctly given by the GGA or the Xα theory.

−

In section IV, we study the ﬁnite a case in which the
overlap of the localized wavefunctions on diﬀerent sites
cannot be neglected.
In this case, the single particle
wavefunctions must be extended. Therefore, similar to
the reported results in the last paragraph, we expect that
the work function is still signiﬁcantly underestimated by
the GGA or the Xα method when a is not small. This ex-
pectation is indeed correct up to a = 5 at which the band
width is nearly 0.25. When a is suﬃciently small, the sin-
gle particle states can be characterized by the plane wave
and the work function should be correctly predicted by
the GGA or the Xα theory.

Finally in section V, we summarize our results.

II. THE MODEL

Let us consider N hydrogen atoms located on a cubic
lattice with the lattice constant a. For simplicity, we
assume that the spins of all electrons are up.
In this
paper, we study the work function for the N electrons
system, i.e., the ground state energy diﬀerence between
the N electrons system and the N
1 electrons system
with ﬁxed a.

−

−

We investigate this system using the Hartree Fock
method and the GGA or the Xα method. The corre-
lation energy is not signiﬁcant because the spins of the
electrons are parallel. Actually, the contribution of the
correlation energy to the work function is estimated to
37/a4 when a is large. Hence, the Hartree Fock
be
method is accurate to predict the work function. On the
other hand, the GGA is also quite simple in this case be-
cause only the exchange functional is signiﬁcant whileas
the correlation functional is small (In this paper, we shall
ignore the correlation functional because it is absent for
a single hydrogen atom.). We focus on the error of the
work function predicted by the GGA or the Xα method.

can be also obtained by the transition state method gen-

out that for ﬁnite system or when the hole state is local-
ized, Eq.(14) is no longer valid.

From many calculations for atoms and small molec-
ulars, we know that the orbital energy obtained in the
GGA or the Xα method is signiﬁcantly lower than the
exact ionization potential. Therefore, one suspects that
W is signiﬁcantly underestimated by Eq.(14) in solids in
which the valence electrons cannot be described by the
plane wave states. In the following sections, this suspec-
tion has been proved to be true.

III. NON OVERLAPPING CASE

In this section, we study the large a case in which the
overlap between the atomic wavefunctions on diﬀerent
sites is negligible. In this case, one can immediately ob-
tain the solution in the Hartree Fock theory and in the
GGA or the Xα method. Actually in the Hartree Fock
theory, we have

(16)

Therefore, the work function predicted by the Hartree
Fock approximation is W HF = 0.5. There is a correction
to W from the correlation energy in the N

system corresponding to the hole polarization term. The
37/a4 (We have ignore

The above equation indicates that the work function W
is indeed given by the orbital energy of the single atom
in the GGA or the Xα method in this case. However, it
is well known that the orbital energy of a single atom in
the GGA or the Xα method is much less in magnitude
than the corresponding ionization potential. For hydro-

We need to point out that the above conclusion is not
only applicable to the hypothetic solid in which the spin
polarized hydrogen atoms are located on a cubic lattice,
but also applicable to the real crystalline solids, with spin
up and spin down electrons, satisfying the following two
conditions (i) The energy bands are either completely
ﬁlled or completely empty. (ii) The lattice constant is suf-
ﬁciently large such that the overlap of the wavefunctions
between diﬀerent lattice sites is negligible. This conclu-
sion can be derived using the exactly same way as for our
hypothetic solid. Many real solids for instance, the solids
formed by Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe atoms at low temperatures and
even ice (Note that there is polarization induced by the
dipole moment by the nearby water molecular. But this
eﬀect is very small.) may satisfy the above two con-
ditions.
It should be noticed that for instance for the
Ne solid, the work function is obtained by the Hartree
Fock orbital energy together with the corrections from
the electron correlation eﬀect as well as the lattice relax-
ation eﬀect (i.e., the polaron eﬀect). The magnitude of
those corrections should be less than 0.1. However, the
diﬀerence of the orbital energy between the HF theory
and the GGA is estimated as 0.4. So the underestima-
tion of the work function for the solid Ne given by the
GGA is expected to be quite signiﬁcant (about 0.3).

Although the ionization potential is remarkably un-
derestimated in the non-overlapping case, the total elec-
tronic energy E is still correctly given by the GGA or the
Xα method when the band is completely ﬁlled. Since

Since

the bandwidth is vanishing in the non-
overlapping case, it may be interesting to consider the
localized hole state. In this case, the ionization potential

equals 0.5
the Xα method. Unfortunately, the GGA predicts that
the energy of the extended hole state is lower than the
energy of the localized hole state.

−

It may be pedagogic to discuss the case that the band
is only partially ﬁlled. Here, for simplicity, we shall only
consider the inﬁnite a case. Suppose that there are Z
≤
N spin polarized electrons in the system. Assuming that
the single particle states are all extended over the whole
lattice. In the Xα theory, the total electronic energy is
found to be

in the construction of Bloch states, where ξ is a varia-
tional scaling parameter which is used to minimize the
total Xα energy. Therefore, the total electronic energy
is signiﬁcantly overestimated when the band is only par-
tially ﬁlled. Interestingly, when Z

obtain a lower value for E(Z, N ) by assuming all single
particle states are extended only over ﬁve lattice sites.

It may be necessary to mention that this deﬁciency in
the GGA or the Xα method is also found [10, 11, 12] in
some molecular systems at the dissociation limit, such
as H+
2 , NaCl, et.al. Essentially, both failures of the
GGA or the Xα method for the solids at large a and
for moleculars at the dissociation limit are caused by the
same reason. The authors in Ref. [10, 11, 12] attributed
this type of failure to the so called self-interaction error.
However, we deem that this viewpoint is inappropriate
because the self-interaction error is zero in our system,
yet the magnitude of the total electronic energy is still
signiﬁcantly overestimated by the Xα method. This fact
also suggests that the self-interaction-corrected local den-
sity approximation method [13, 14] is not helpful to im-
prove the result.

We notice as well that the overestimation of the magni-
tude of the electronic energy by the Xα method is more
pronounced in our system than in diatomic molecular
cases, because the electronic states are much more ex-
tended in our case. For instance, consider the ioniza-
tion potential of two spin polarized hydrogen atoms at
the ﬁxed separation distance a. When a is large and
the atomic wavefunction overlap between two hydrogen
atoms is negligible small, we can obtain that the error of

where the polarization term has been neglected because
it is proportional to 1/a4. This error is signiﬁcantly lower
than that in solid case. For instance, when a = 5, this
number is only 0.04 which is much less than 0.21 in the
solid case. This fact explains why the GGA or the Xα
method are still successful for small molecular near equi-
librium geometry.

IV. FINITE OVERLAP CASE

In the last section, we have discussed the large a case in
which the overlap of the wavefunctions on diﬀerent sites
is negligible. However, the GGA or the Xα method are
usually applied to real solids of ﬁnite bandwidth. When
a is suﬃciently small, the electrons in our system can be
described by the plane wave. Therefore, one may specu-
late that the GGA becomes valid for not large a case in
our system. On the other hand, for large a, the atomic
nature still remains and it can be expected that the er-
ror of the work function predicted by the GGA or the
Xα method is still signiﬁcant even when the bandwidth
is ﬁnite. So it is highly desirable to see how this error
decreases when a decreases.

When a is ﬁnite and the bandwidth is not zero, it is not
easy to calculate the electronic energy accurately even
within the framework of the HF theory or the GGA. In-
stead, we shall take several approximations which can

6
greatly simplify the calculations.
At ﬁrst, we assume uHF

(r) and calcu-
k (r)
late the diﬀerence of the work function predicted by the
Hartree Fock theory and the GGA or the Xα method.
When the hole state is extended, straightforward calcu-
lation yields

WGGA are the work function obtained by the Hartree
Fock theory and the GGA, respectively. Note that this
assumption has been tested in atomic calculations. The
error from this assumption is found to be insigniﬁcant[3].

Secondly, we assume

(33)

This assumption is valid in the tight binding limit. While
k > states are
for small a and large bandwidth, diﬀerent

made of diﬀerent φ and this assumption becomes invalid.
However, since both the quantities < kX
Xk > and vxc
|
do not depend on uk sensitively, we expect that this as-
sumption is valid at least when a is not small. Under
this assumption, the work function diﬀerence ∆W can
be evaluated numerically.

Thirdly, we shall use the Xα exchange functional with
the parameter α = αH selected to cancel the self-
interaction exactly in the atomic limit. So we have

when a = 3 and a = 4, we expect that the second approx-
imation becomes invalid. For instance when a = 4, the
bandwidth is estimated as 0.5 and the electronic states
cannot be described by Eq.(31).). Even after subtract-
ing the correction from the correlation energy contribu-
tion 37/a4, the underestimation of the work function by
this Xα method is still about 0.12 at a = 5. On the
other hand, the band width is about 0.25 when a = 5.
Therefore, we can conclude that the work function will
be underestimated by the Xα method when (i) the va-
lence bands are completely ﬁlled and (ii) the bandwidth
of the valence bands is not large.

mation [4] exchange functional to calculate ∆2. In GGA,

As expected, ∆2 evaluated by this formula is indeed
slightly less than that by the Xα method. For instance,
when a = 4, ∆2 is found to be 0.548 in GGA which is
slightly less than the value 0.577 given by Xα method.

Since αH is greater than the corresponding value in the
electron gas model, and furthermore our system will re-
duce to the electron gas model in the small a limit, we
expect that this exchange functional will slightly overes-
timate the exchange energy in the ﬁnite a case. Table.1
lists the numerical value of ∆1, ∆2 and ∆W for vari-
ous values of a. From this table, one can see that when

In this paper, we have studied the hypothetic system
composed of the hydrogen atoms with spin polarized elec-
trons on a cubic lattice. We found that for the case of
narrow bandwidth and completely ﬁlled band, the work
function is signiﬁcantly underestimated by the GGA or
the Xα method. This is attributed to the signiﬁcant lower
energy of the extended hole state obtained by the GGA or

6

the Xα method. Note that this problem cannot be cured
by assuming that the hole state is localized. Actually,
the GGA or the Xα method predicts a signiﬁcant lower
energy for the extended hole state than for the localized
hole state even in the zero bandwidth limit.

Although we have only calculated a hypothetic system,
our results may lead us to speculate the validness of the
GGA or the Xα method in the calculations of the work
function of the insulators with narrow valence bands in
many ionic crystals, as well as Ne,Ar,Kr,Xe solids (as-
suming the lattice constant ﬁxed.). Furthermore, it is
not diﬃcult to see that the GGA or the Xα method be-
comes invalid in calculating the ionization potential for
the extended, including noncrystalline, systems, where
the valence electrons cannot be described by the plane
waves. As we have already observed, the GGA or the
Xα method would predict that the hole state is extended
over many diﬀerent regions which are distant from each
other even in inhomogeneous systems. Such prediction
diﬀers from the commonsense.

In section III, we have also pointed out that the mag-
nitude of the total electronic energy is signiﬁcantly over-
estimated by the GGA in the large a limit when the
band is not completely ﬁlled. Actually, Zhang and Yang
and other groups [10, 11, 12] also found that H+
2 ,F+
2 ,
NaCl et.al. would not be dissociated correctly in the
GGA in the large distance limit. This deﬁciency is more
pronounced in solids because the electronic states are
more extended. It should be emphasized that the self-
interaction of the electronic states in our system is negli-
gibly small. Therefore, this deﬁciency cannot be removed
by the so called self-interaction-corrected local density
approximation method[13, 14].

In summary, we speculate that the exact exchange-
correlation functional is highly nonlocal when the elec-
tron density n(r) varies in space and the system is ex-
tended in the density functional theory[1]. When the
density of the valence electrons varies greatly in space
and the system is extended, the GGA and the Xα method
may be unsuitable to describe the system properly.

Accurate QED evaluations of the one- and two-photon interelectron interaction for low lying two-
and three-electron conﬁgurations for ions with nuclear charge numbers 60 ≤ Z ≤ 93 are performed.
The three-photon interaction is also partly taken into account. The Coulomb gauge is employed. The
results are compared with available experimental data and with diﬀerent calculations. A detailed
3P0
investigation of the behaviour of the energy levels of the conﬁgurations 1s1/22s1/2
near the crossing points Z = 64 and Z = 92 is carried out. The crossing points are important for
the future experimental search for parity nonconserving (PNC) eﬀects in highly charged ions.

I. INTRODUCTION

During the most recent years the energy levels of two- and three-electron conﬁgurations are under very intensive

experimental and theoretical investigation.

Accurate calculations of the energy levels for the two-electron conﬁgurations 1s1/22s1/2

3P0, and
3S1 were already performed in [1,2]. In these papers the interelectron interaction has been considered in
1s1/22s1/2
various approximations: on the basis of variational Schr¨odinger-wave functions with inclusion of relativistic correlations
[1] and using relativistic many-body perturbation theory (RMBPT) [2]. For a long time these approaches deﬁned the
standard concerning the level of accuracy. In recent years due to new developments in experimental and theoretical
methods the necessity to improve the accuracy of calculations became urgent. Recently, rigorous QED evaluations of
two-photon exchange corrections for low lying conﬁgurations [3,4] have been performed.

1S0, 1s1/22p1/2

First calculations of the energy levels for the three-electron conﬁguration have been presented in [5–9]. As in
the early papers on two-electron ions in these calculations the two- and many-photon exchange has been considered
approximately. Complete QED calculations of the two-photon exchange for three-electron ions have been performed
in [10,4]. Within the framework of RMBPT the three-photon exchange has also been taken into account in [11,10,4].
In this paper we present an extension of previous calculations for two-and three-electron ions [4] for a variety of
3P0 level, which have not been performed in [4].
Z values. Here we include also the evaluations for the 1s1/22p1/2
3P0 levels near Z = 64
Special attention has been paid to eleborate the behaviour of the 1s1/22s1/2
and Z = 92, where they become very close to each other. Accordingly, these system become suitable for monitoring
parity-nonconserving (PNC) eﬀects. Experimental investigations of PNC eﬀects in two-electron highly charged ions
are under intensive discussion [12–15]. The preparation of such experiments requires a precise knowledge of the exact
diﬀerence between these energy levels.

1S0 and 1s1/22p1/2

II. THEORY

In this article we evaluate corrections to the energy levels due to photon exchange. To calculate these corrections
we employ the adiabatic S-matrix approach [16,17] and the line proﬁle approach (LPA) [18]. Both methods are based
on the Furry picture [19], which describes the many-electron atom as a set of bound electrons, moving in the external
ﬁeld of the nucleus and interacting with each other via the exchange of photons. With the aid of the Feynman rules
for bound-state QED [20,21] the processes giving rise to corrections to the energy levels can be represented in terms
of Feynman graphs. The photon-exchange corrections evaluated in this article are depicted in Figs. 1-5.

As it has been shown in Refs. [22,20] the S-matrix approach is best suited for the evaluation of corrections described
by the irreducible parts of the diagrams. However, its application to the evaluation of the reducible parts becomes

and for the application of this method we refer to [4].

A. The two-electron conﬁgurations

At ﬁrst we consider the photon exchange corrections for two-electron conﬁgurations. The wavefunction of a two-

electron conﬁgurations is represented by

ΨJMj1j2l1l2 (r1, r2) = N

Cj1j2
JM (m1m2) [ψj1l1m1(r1)ψj2l2m2(r2)

ψj1l1m1 (r2)ψj2l2m2 (r1)] ,

(4)

−

Xm1m2

where N = 1/2 for equivalent electrons and N = 1/√2 for non-equivalent electrons, Cj1j2
JM (m1m2) is a Clebsch-Gordan
symbol. By means of Eq. (4) we can specify the conﬁguration 1s2s 3S1 by setting a, b = 1s+, 2s+, where
denote the
two diﬀerent projections of the total electron angular momentum and we can derive the energy corrections according
to the formula:

±

Here Fab... denotes a function of one-electron states which are described by wave functions ψa, ψb, . . .. The form of
the function F depends on the type of Feynman graph under cosideration (see below). For the electron conﬁgurations
1s2s 1S0 and 1s2p 1P0 the energy corrections are given by

and

and

∆E(1s2s 3S1) = F1s+2s+;1s+2s+ ,

respectively. The corrections due to one-photon exchange are represented by the graph in Fig. 1. This diagram is
irreducible so that the S-matrix approach can be applied leading to

The two-photon exchange corrections are represented by the graphs in Fig. 2. The “box” diagram is reducible. Its
reducible part is deﬁned by the condition εn1 + εn2 = εa + εb. The “cross” diagram is irreducible. However, it is most
convenient to extract the contribution with n1, n2 equal to a or b and to treat it like a reducible part of the “cross”
diagram. Contributions due to states n1, n2 included in the reducible parts are called reference state contribution.
Application of the S-matrix approach for calculating the irreducible part and of the LPA for the reducible part of the
“box” and “cross” diagrams, respectively, results in the explicit formulas:

The prime at the summation symbols indicates that the proper reference state members are ejected. The double prime
indicates that only the reference state members are retained. In order to avoid division by zero in Eq. (13) in the case
a = b′ and n1 = n2 one has to take the limit εn1 →
εn2 in both terms on the right-hand side. Thus the singularities
cancel. It should be stressed that Eq. (14) coincides with the result of this limiting process. From Eqs. (12) and (14)
it follows automatically, that the corrections vanish for g = g′ = c. The case g = g′ = c corresponds to the Coulomb-
Coulomb correction, the case g = g′ = t determines the Breit-Breit and the case g = c, g′ = t or g = t, g′ = c refers to
the Coulomb-Breit interaction.

For high-Z ions considered in this work the third-order contribution turns out to be small and it is suﬃcient to take
into account its dominant part only. Accordingly, we consider only the third-order Coulomb and unretarded Breit
“box” corrections. The corresponding Feynman graph is displayed in Fig. 3. The formula for the irreducible part of
the third-order “box” correction can be derived in the same manner as for the corrections given by Eqs. (9, 11). It
takes the form

where the prime indicates that the reference state contributions are excluded from the summation. Here the reference

Fig. 3 we derive the following expression for the reducible part

B. The three-electron conﬁgurations

Now we turn to three-electron ions. Here we consider three-electron conﬁgurations with a closed (1s)2 shell, which

can be described by the wave function

Ψ(r1, r2, r3) =

ǫijk ψi(r1)ψj(r2)ψk(r3) .

√3! Xi,j,k=1,2,3

ǫijk denotes the Levi-Civita symbol and ψ1(r), ψ2(r), ψ3(r) denote one-electron wave functions.

As in the two-electron case we have to consider corrections represented by the two-electron Feynman graphs depicted

in Figs. 1-3. Their contribution to the energy shift is given by

∆E(
{

}

abc

) = Fab;ab + Fbc;bc + Fca;ca ,

where Fab;cd is given by Eqs. (10) and (9 - 16). The set

Besides the two-electron diagrams, in three-electron problem we have to take into account the additional three-
electron Feynman graphs depicted in Figs. 4 and 5. The contribution of the three-electron graphs can be calculated
according to

As it has been mentioned above, for the three-photon corrections we take into account only their dominant parts,
i.e., the third-order Coulomb and unretarded Breit “box” contributions. The corresponding tree-electron Feynman
graphs are displayed in Fig. 5. The formulas for the irreducible and the reducible parts of the third-order “box”
correction are derived in the same manner as in Eqs. (15,16). The irreducible part can be expressed as

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The major result of the present work consists in the calculation of the two- and three-photon exchange correc-
tions to the energy levels of two-electron conﬁgurations 21S0, 23P0, 23S1 and three-electron conﬁgurations (1s)22s1/2,
(1s)22p1/2. The two-photon exchange correction represents the leading part of the perturbation theory in second
order. Accordingly, the main uncertainty of the theoretical values calculated earlier has been due to this correction.
In order to represent the Coulomb potential of the nucleus we employ a Fermi model for the nuclear density

The results of our calculation of the two-photon exchange correction are presented in Tables II, III, IV, V, VI,
VII for two-electron conﬁgurations and in Tables VIII, IX, X, XI for three-electron conﬁgurations, respectively. Our
calculation is performed rigorously within the framework of QED. For reasons of clarity the corresponding corrections
refering to contributions of the Feynman graphs in Figs. 2 and 4 are also listed separately in these tables. For details
concerning the numerical procedure we refer to [4]. The accuracy of the present calculations is on the level of about
0.0001 a.u.

We also have taken into account the dominant part of the three-photon exchange correction. Details of the ap-

are presented in Tables XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII for two-electron conﬁgurations and in Tables XVIII, XIX,
XX, XXI for three-electron conﬁgurations, respectively. Again, the contribution due to the exchange of the various
photons are compiled separately in the tables. The correction caused by the exchange of three Breit photons is not
included since it was found to be less than 0.001 eV. In view of the approximation used to evaluate the three-photon
exchange correction these values are given within an inaccuracy of about 10 % [4].

In Tables XXII, XXIII, XXIV, XXV, XXVI, XXVII, XXVIII, XXIX, XXX we collect all available corrections to
the energy levels of the two-electron conﬁgurations under consideration. In order to compare our numerical data
for the two-electron conﬁgurations 23P0 and 23S1 with other results in the literature we also provide values for the
two-photon exchange correction as it has been derived in [3]. We ﬁnd that the data presented in [3] deviate from our
results by not more than 0.0003 a.u.

Values for the energy of the three-electron conﬁgurations are presented in Tables XXXI, XXXII, XXXIII, XXXIV,
XXXV, XXXVI. Comparing our results for the two-photon exchange correction with data presented in Ref. [10],
we achieved a very good agreement for the (1s)22s1/2 conﬁguration. However, for the (1s)22p1/2 level we ﬁnd a
discrepancy of about 0.0035 a.u. for Z = 60, 70. The three-photon exchange correction is compared with the results
obtained in [11]. In [11] the exchange of two and three Breit photons has been neglected.

The numbers for the recoil correction included in the tables for the total level energies of two- and three-electron
conﬁgurations are abtained by interpolation for those Z values not calculated in the refered paper. The data for
the self-energy (SE) screening and vacuum polarization (VP) screening of three-electron conﬁgurations as well as for
the VP screening of two-electron conﬁgurations have been obtained via a similar interpolation. Results for the SE
screening corrections of two-electron conﬁgurations have been obtained according to a procedure which is based on the
results provided in [25]. In particular we refer to Table II of Ref. [25], where the self-energy screening function f (Zα)
for K- and L-shell single-electron states have been presented. From these values one can deduce the corresponding self-
energy shift of a single-electron state due to the screening eﬀect of another single electron state. E.g., we may denote
by E1s by 2s the screening correction to the 1s-electron self-energy shift due to the 2s-electron state and by E2s by 1s the
screening correction to the 2s-self energy originating from the 1s-electron state, respectively. Accordingly, we suppose
3S1 scr for the 1S0 and 3S1 conﬁguration is represented by
that the sum of the SE screening corrections E
1S0 exch
E1s by 2s + E2s by 1s = E
3S1 exch are the ﬁrst-order interelectron interaction corrections for the corresponding conﬁgurations. For the 3P0
and E
conﬁguration we deﬁne E1s by 2p1/2 + E2p1/2 by 1s = E

3S1 scr. Then we suppose that E

3S1 scr, where E

1S0 scr and E

3S1 exch = E

1S0 scr + E

1S0 exch/E

1S0 scr/E

3P0 scr.

In Table XXXVII we present the total values for the energy levels of the two-electron conﬁgurations derived in this
paper and compare them with the results of [2] and [1], respectively. The diﬀerences between the energy levels are also
listed in that table. We should note that in Ref. [1,2], diﬀerent approaches have been employed, i.e., the relativistic-
all-order-theory (AO) [2] and the uniﬁed theory (UT) [1]. Compared with the rigorous QED approach, these theories
involve several approximations, i.e., neglection of (i) negative energy states, (ii) crossed photon contributions, and (iii)
exact retardation eﬀects. However, they account for some part of higher-order interelectron interaction corrections.
Accodingly, for highly-charged ions the total data derived in Tables XXII, XXIII, XXV, XXVI, XXVIII, XXIX,
XXXI, XXXII, XXXIV, XXXV provide the most accurate theoretical predictions for the energy levels at present.

From the results presented in Table XXXVII one can conclude that the conﬁgurations 21S0 and 23P0 cross within
the interval 60 < Z < 70. Experimental investigation of PNC eﬀects in heliumlike ions requires a precise knowledge
of the energy diﬀerence between these levels at Z = 63 [15]. UT theory [1] predicts a value for this diﬀerence of about
0.168 eV, while the calculation presented in this paper gives a larger value of 0.593 eV. However, our calculations
0.016 eV.
predict that the crossing of these levels takes place near Z = 66 with an energy diﬀerence of about
Nevertheless, the He-like Eu ion (Z = 63) seems most suitable for the search of PNC eﬀects [15]. We also investigated
the splitting E(21S0)
63Eu and obtained an energy diﬀerence 0.001eV, which
does not change the conclusions made in [15]. The present calculation also indicates that the other crossing point can
be expected to be close to Z = 89, 90.

FIG. 1. Feynman graph, describing the ﬁrst-order interelectron interaction. The double solid lines correspond to bound
electrons in the ﬁeld of the nucleus, the wavy line corresponds to the sum of the Coulomb and Breit (transverse) photons. If
a′
= b, b′
= a we call it “exchange” graph. The latter name should be
understood in connection with respect to permutation symmetry.

= b the graph is called “direct”, in case a′

= a and b′

b

FIG. 2. Feynman graphs describing the second-order interelectron interaction. The graph a) is called “box” and the graph

b) is called “cross”. Notations are the same as in Fig. 1. By n1, n2 the summation over intermediate states is indicated.

FIG. 3. The third-order “box” Feynman graph. The notations are the same as in Figs. 1, 2. Here the wavy lines with the

a

b

cross denote the sum of the Coulomb and unretarded Breit interaction.

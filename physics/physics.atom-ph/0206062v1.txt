Energies of (2s22p53l3l′) and (2s2p63l3l′) states for sodiumlike ions with Z =14–100 are evaluated
to second order in relativistic many-body perturbation theory starting from a neonlike Dirac-Fock
potential. Second-order Coulomb and Breit interactions are included. Correction for the frequency-
dependence of the Breit interaction is taken into account in lowest order. The Lamb shift correction
to energies is also included in lowest order. Intrinsic particle-particle-hole contributions to energies
are found to be 20-30% of the sum of one- and two-body contributions. Comparisons are made
with available experimental data. These calculations are presented as a theoretical benchmark for
comparison with experiment and theory.

INTRODUCTION

Core-excited states of Na-like ions have two valence
electrons outside and one hole inside a closed n=2 core
and, therefore, present an excellent model for studying
strong correlations in systems with closely-spaced levels.
We carry out second-order relativistic many-body per-
turbation theory (RMBPT) calculations for Na-like ions
starting from a 1s22s22p6 Dirac-Fock (DF) potential. All
possible 2l holes and 3l′3l′′ particles leading to 121 odd-
parity and 116 even-parity 3l′3l′′[J1]2l−1(J) states are
considered. We calculate energies of the 237 core-excited
states together with the 3l singly-excited states in Na-like
ions with nuclear charges Z ranging from 14 to 100.

Many experimental values for the energy levels and
ﬁne-structure intervals are now available up to very high
nuclear charge (Z=57) for 3l′3l′′[J1]2l−1(J) levels; ad-
ditionally, experimental rates for some transitions be-
tween these levels are available. The objective of this
paper is to present a comprehensive set of calculations
for 3l′3l′′[J1]2l−1(J) energies to compare with previous
calculations and experiments for the entire Na isoelec-
tronic sequence. Most earlier measurements and calcu-
lations focused on the 3s2[1S]2p−1 2PJ states and low-
lying 3s3p[3P ]2p−1 4DJ and 3s3d[3D]2p−1 4FJ levels.
Very few results exist for other 3p22p−1, 3s3p2p−1, and
3s3d2p−1 levels. The large number of possible transitions
have made experimental identiﬁcation diﬃcult. Experi-
mental veriﬁcation should become simpler and more re-

92 using the multiconﬁguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF)
method. Wavelengths, radiative transition rates, Auger
rates, satellite intensity factors, and ﬂuorescence yields
were presented by Nilsen [4] for dielectronic satellites
of 14 neon-like ions (Ar8+ - W64+) including 2s22p63l–
2s22p53l′3l′′ and 2s22p63l -2s2p63l′3l′′ transitions. The
calculations in [4] were made using the yoda code which
is based on multiconﬁguration relativistic functions for
the bound states and distorted-wave Dirac wave func-
tions for continuum electrons. New comprehensive theo-
retical analyses of the 2s22p53lnl′ and 2s2p63lnl′ (n=3-8)
doubly-excited states in Fe15+ and Cu18+ were presented
by Bruch et al. [5, 6]. In these papers, energy levels, ra-
diative transitions probabilities, and autoionization rates
were calculated by using the Cowan and yoda codes. Re-
cently, R-matrix calculations of electron-impact collision
strengths for excitation from the inner L-shell into dou-
bly excited states of Fe15+ were presented by Bautista [7].
Energy positions of the 2s22p63l and 2s22p53l3l′ states
were calculated in that work using the superstructure
code of Eissner et al. [8]. It was shown in [7] that dis-
agreement between calculations and data recommended
by Sugar and Corliss [9] and Shirai et al. [10] ranges from
0.5% to 5%.

Studies of the 2s22p53lnl′ conﬁgurations in Na-like ions
are of continuing interest from both theoretical and ex-
perimental points of view. Experimentally, these con-
ﬁgurations are studied by photon and electron emission
spectroscopy. To our knowledge, the ﬁrst measurements
of 2p
3d transitions in Na-like Fe (which in-
cluded the 2s22p53l3l′ conﬁgurations) using photon emis-
sion spectroscopy were done by Burkhalter et al. [11] in
1979. The soft x-ray spectra produced by a focused laser
source and a vacuum spark device were obtained in [11]
using a grazing incidence spectrograph. Identiﬁcation of
the spectra was based on theoretical calculations using
the Cowan code. The 2s22p53s3p 4D7/2 - 2s22p53s3d
4G9/2 transition in FeXVI was observed by the beam-foil
technique by Jup´en et al. [12]. The identiﬁcation of this
transition was based on a study of the diﬀerence in wave
numbers between experimental values and theoretical
predictions obtained from the Cowan code in Na-like ions
from S VI to Cu XIX. Auger electron spectra of Na-like Fe
ions excited in collisions of 170-keV Fe XVIII on He and
Ne were studied by Schneider et al. [13]. The dominant
spectral structures were due to Auger decay of states with
2s22p53l3l′ conﬁgurations in FeXVI. Special attention
was paid to the metastable level 2s22p53s3p 4D7/2 which
was studied in detail; the absolute energy of this level was
measured. Three of the 17 lines observed in this experi-
ment were identiﬁed with states from 2s22p53l4l′ conﬁg-
urations. This analysis was based on theoretical predic-
tions using the multiconﬁgurational Dirac-Fock method
including the transverse Breit interaction. A few years
later this analysis was extended to include an isoelec-
tronic study of double electron capture in slow ion-atom
collisions of F-like ions (Si5+, Ar9+, Sc12+, Ti13+, Fe17+,
and Cu20+) with He atoms [14].
It was reported that
the metastable level 2s22p53s3p 4D7/2 was observed in
all Auger spectra except Si3+. Recently in [15], a study
of the double electron capture in low-energy Fe17+ + He
collisions was conducted. Except for the conﬁrmation of
the identiﬁcation of the 12 peaks in the 225 - 340 eV
interval, predictions were made for identiﬁcation of four
additional peaks in the 585 - 670 eV interval. A com-
parison of solar and tokamak FeXVII x-ray spectra with
synthetic spectra including dielectronic satellites with
2s22p6nl
2s22p53dnl tran-
sitions was presented by Phillips et al. [16]. Atomic data
were calculated in Phillips et al. [16] using the super-
structure code. Recently, the three Fe15+ inner-shell
satellite lines were thoroughly studied at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory electron beam ion trap
ebit-ii by Brown et al. [17].

In the present paper, we use RMBPT to determine en-
ergies of 2s22p53l3l′ and 2s2p63l3l′ states for Na-like ions
with nuclear charges in the range of Z = 14–100. Our
calculations are carried out to second order in perturba-
tion theory and include second-order Coulomb and Breit
interactions. Corrections for the frequency-dependent
Breit interaction are taken into account in the lowest or-
der. Screened self-energy and vacuum polarization data

2

given by Blundell [18] are used to determine the QED
correction.

Our perturbation theory calculations are carried out
using single-particle orbitals calculated in the DF poten-
tial of the Ne-like core. As a ﬁrst step, we determine and
store the single-particle contributions to the energies for
three n=2 hole states (2s, 2p1/2, and 2p3/2) and the ﬁve
n=3 valence states (3s, 3p1/2, 3p3/2, 3d3/2, and 3d5/2) in
lowest, ﬁrst, and second orders. Next, we evaluate and

were used previously to evaluate energies of the 3l3l′ lev-
els in Mg-like ions [19] and energies of the 2l−13l′ lev-
els in neonlike ions [20]. Finally, second-order particle-
particle-hole matrix elements are evaluated. Combining
these data using the method described below, we cal-
culate one-, two-, and three-body contributions to the
energies of Na-like ions.

The present calculations are compared with experi-
mental and predicted results from Refs. [12, 15, 21, 22].

II. METHOD

The RMBPT formalism developed previously [23, 24,
25] for B-like and Al-like ions is used here to describe the
perturbed wave functions and to obtain the second-order
energies [23] of the core-excited states of Na-like ions.
The particle-particle-hole contribution to the energies of
those states is, however, diﬀerent from the three-particle
contribution to the energies of B-like and Al-like ions,
and is derived in the Appendix. Including hole-particle
matrix elements in Na-like ions leads to 237 3l3l′2l−1
states instead of 148 3l3l′3l′′ states of Al-like ions or 15
2l2l′2l′′ of B-like ions and, consequently, to more labori-
ous numerical calculations.

A. Model space

The model space for core-excited 3l3l′2l−1 states of
Na-like ions includes 121 odd-parity states consisting of
25 J=1/2 states, 37 J=3/2 states, 31 J=5/2 states, 19
J=7/2 states, 7 J=9/2 states, and two J=11/2 states.
Additionally, there are 116 even-parity states consisting
of 25 J=1/2 states, 35 J=3/2 states, 31 J=5/2 states,
17 J=7/2 states, 7 J=9/2 states, and one J=11/2 state.
The evaluation of the second-order energies for the
3l3l′[J1]2l−1(J) states in Na-like ions follows the pat-
tern of the corresponding calculation for Mg-like and Ne-
In particular, we use

the second-order one-particle and two-particle matrix ele-
ments for Mg-like ions calculated in [19] and hole-particle
matrix elements for Ne-like ions calculated in [20]. These

3

matrix elements are recoupled as described below to ob-
tain the one-body and two-body contributions for Na-
like ions. We will discuss how these matrix elements are
combined to obtain the one-body and two-body contri-
butions to energies of Na-like ions. We refer the reader
to Refs. [19, 20] for a discussion of the evaluation of
the one-body and two-body matrix elements. An intrin-
sic particle-particle-hole diagram also contributes to the
second-order energy for Na-like ions. The expression for
particle-particle-hole diagram diﬀers from the expression
for the three-particle diagram given in Ref. [23] owing to
diﬀerent angular parts. The expression for the intrinsic
particle-particle-hole diagram is derived in Appendix.

order contribution B(2) can be about half of B(2)

nally, we observe some small deviations from smooth Z-
dependencies of E(2)
in Figs. 2a and 2b. As we

can see from Eq. (A10) in the Appendix, the denominator
ε(v) + ε(w)
ε(n) in the expression for the three-
body diagram contains two valence energies ε(v), ε(w),
one hole energy ε(a), and one virtual state energy ε(n).
The sum ε(3s) + ε(3s)
ε(2p) is positive; therefore, the
denominator can be close to zero when ε(n) is positive.
In such a case, a singularity arises from the contribution
of the continuous part of spectra to the sum over states
for the E(2)
3 matrix elements, resulting in sharp
features in the corresponding Z-dependencies.

tributions are plotted in Fig. 2b. We see from Fig. 2a
that the ratio of E(2)
is about 30–50% for high-Z
ions. Fig. 2a illustrates the asymmetry of the nondiag-
onal energy matrix elements for low-Z ions. The asym-
metry of the two-particle second-order matrix elements
in RMBPT calculation was discussed in Ref. [26]. Val-
ues of E(2)

After evaluating the energy matrices, we calculate
eigenvalues and eigenvectors for states with given val-
ues of J and parity. There are two possible methods to
carry out the diagonalization: (a) diagonalize the sum
of zeroth- and ﬁrst-order matrices, then calculate the
second-order contributions using the resulting eigenvec-
tors or (b) diagonalize the sum of the zeroth-, ﬁrst-, and
second-order matrices together. Following Ref. [23], we
choose the second method here.

The importance of second-order contributions to the
energies is illustrated in Fig. 3. In this ﬁgure, the second-
order energy E(2), the ﬁrst- and second-order Breit con-
tributions B(1) and B(2), and the QED contribution
ELAMB are plotted as functions of nuclear charge Z for
the 3s2(1S)2p 2P1/2 (a) and 3s3p(3P )2p 4D7/2 (b) states
of Na-like ions. We can see from the ﬁgure that E(2)
dominates up to Z=34 and Z=37 for the 3s22p 2P1/2
and 3s3p(3P )2p 4D7/2 states, respectively. The QED
contribution ELAMB is smaller than the E(2) energy up
to Z=50 for the energy level shown in Fig. 3a and Z=60
for the energy level shown in Fig. 3b. The second-order
Breit energy B(2) is smaller than the second-order energy
E(2) up to Z=97 (Fig. 3a) and Z=83 (Fig. 3b), respec-
tively.

The sharp features in the curves shown in the
Fig. 3a are explained by strong mixing of states in-
side of the odd-parity complex with J=1/2. The main
contribution to the 3s2(1S)2p 2P1/2 level comes from
the 3s1/23s1/2[0]2p1/2 state for ions with small Z up
to Z=48.
Starting from Z=49, the main contribu-
tion to this level comes from 3p1/23p3/2[1]2p3/2 and
3p1/23p3/2[2]2p3/2 states instead of 3s1/23s1/2[0]2p1/2
state.

The particle-particle-hole levels studied in this work
may be divided to two groups by their energies: those
with energies in the range of 15–23 a.u and those
with energies greater than 25 a.u. The ﬁrst group
of

When starting calculations from relativistic DF wave
functions, it is natural to use jj designations for uncou-
pled energy matrix elements; however, neither jj nor
LS coupling describes physical states properly, except
for the single-conﬁguration state 3p3/23d5/2[4]2p3/2 ≡

It should be noted that the LS designations are chosen
by comparing results with available experimental data
for low-Z ions. We used the labeling of levels from
Refs. [5, 6], where the identiﬁcation of levels in Fe15+
and Cu18+ was based on the Cowan code. We already
mentioned that there are no measurements for the second
group of levels, therefore, we do not give LS designations

for the levels shown in Figs. 4c, d. The change of rela-
tive magnitude of mixing coeﬃcients is illustrated by the
behavior of the six levels in Fig. 4a and the ﬁve levels
in Fig. 4b. The crossing of levels inside of a complex
(set of levels with the same J and parity) is forbidden by
Wigner-Neumann theorem [27].

III. COMPARISON OF RESULTS WITH
OTHER THEORY AND EXPERIMENT

We have calculated energies of the 121 odd-parity
states and the 116 even-parity excited states for Na-
like ions with nuclear charges ranging from Z=14 to
100. In Table I, we illustrate our theoretical results giv-
ing energies of the 38 odd-parity states 3s2(1S)2p 2PJ ,
3s3d(1,3D)2p 2,4LJ , and 3p2(1,3L′)2p 2,4LJ and the 18
even-parity states 3s3p(1,3P )2p 2,4LJ for eight Na-like
ions with nuclear charges ranging from Z=26 to Z=57.
We also include the ground state 3s 2S1/2 energies in the
table.

A. Excitation energies

Comparisons of our RMBPT energies with other the-
oretical and experimental data are too voluminous to
include here; therefore, we present several examples of
comparisons for selected levels and ions. In Table II, our
theoretical results for 3s2(1S)2p 2PJ , 3s3p(1,3P )2p 2,4LJ ,
3p2(1,3L′)2p 2,4LJ , and 3s3d(1,3D)2p 2,4LJ levels of Na-
like Fe are compared with predicted Auger energies given
by Bliman et al. [15]. It should be noted that the pre-
dicted Auger energies in Ref. [15] diﬀer by 1 eV from ex-
perimental measurements presented more than 15 years
ago by Schneider et al. [13], where the method of zero-
degree Auger spectroscopy was used to study the excita-
tion and decay of Auger states formed in 170-keV Fe17+
ions with He and Ne target atoms. Our RMBPT energies
are in much better agreement with recent results from
[15] than with experimental measurements from [13].

In Table III, our RMBPT wavelengths for Na-like Ag
and La are compared with experimental results presented
by Beiersdorfer et al. [21, 22]. Spectra of the n=3 to n=2
transitions in neonlike silver obtained from the Princeton
Large Torus were recorded with high-resolution Bragg-
crystal spectrometer. The measurements covered the
wavelength interval 3.3–4.1 ˚A. Eight lines of Na-like Ag
were observed. As one can see from Table III, our theo-
retical calculations are in excellent agreement with re-
sults from Ref. [21]. Measurement of a single line in
Na-like La was carried out with high-resolution crystal
spectrometer on the PLT tokamak by Beiersdorfer et al.
[22]. Our RMBPT result agrees with experimental wave-
lengths from [22] to ﬁve signiﬁcant ﬁgures. We list our
theoretical data for other lines in La46+ in Table III.

The 3s3p(3P )2p 4D7/2–3s3d(3D)2p 4F9/2 transitions
in P4+-Zn19+ ions were investigated by Jup´en et al. [12].

Identiﬁcation of spectral lines originating from the tran-
sitions between core-excited conﬁgurations in Na isoelec-
tronic sequence was made from analyses of beam-foil
spectra in [12]. Wavelengths λexpt from [12] are shown in
Table IV together with our RMBPT data λRMBPT. We
also present the predicted data λﬁt from Ref. [12] in the
same table. The predicted wavelengths were obtained in
[12] from the ﬁt of the diﬀerence between experimental
data and Cowan code calculations. Our ab initio calcu-
lations are in good agreement with those predictions.

B. Fine structure of the 2L and 4L terms in
core-excited states of Na-like ions

−

No measurements of ﬁne-structure intervals were made
by observing the wavelength diﬀerences between transi-
tions within the doublet or quartet states. The intervals
are obtained by subtracting the excitation energies of the
corresponding levels (see, for example, Auger data in Ta-
ble II). These ﬁne structures are quite regular through-
out the isoelectronic sequence, as seen from Fig. 5a. In
this ﬁgure, we present the ﬁne-structure splitting di-
3)2 for the doublet term 3s2(1S)2p 2P .
vided by (Z
Small deviation from smooth line of Fig. 5a in the re-
gion of Z=48-49 is due to the strong mixing in the odd-
parity complex with J=1/2 as illustrated in Fig. 3a.
The 3s2(1S)2p 2P3/2 level has smaller energy than the
3s2(1S)2p 2P1/2 level in contradiction with Land´e in-
terval rules. The same situation occurs for other ﬁne-
structure intervals in Figs. 5b, c, and d. The 4P3/2 level
has the smallest energy among 3p2(3P )2p 4PJ levels, the
next level is 4P5/2, and the 4P1/2 level has the largest
3)2 decreases
energy. The value of (E1/2 −
3)2 increases
with Z while the value of (E5/2 −
with Z. As a result, energies of 4P1/2 and 4P5/2 become
almost equal for high Z. The energy diﬀerence between
the 4D3/2 and 4D5/2 levels in the 3s3p(3P )2p 4DJ quar-
tet term is very small, as shown in Fig. 5c. We ﬁnd that
the 4DJ quartet terms are ordered as follows: 4D1/2,
4D7/2, 4D3/2, and 4D5/2. Energy diﬀerences between
the 4F5/2, 4F7/2, and 4F9/2 levels in the 3s3d(3D)2p 4FJ
quartet term are very small, as shown in Fig. 5d. The
unusual splitting is caused by mixing of states within the
complexes with diﬀerent J. Further experimental conﬁr-
mation would be very helpful in verifying the correctness
of these occasionally sensitive mixing parameters.

IV. CONCLUSION

A systematic second-order RMBPT study of the en-
ergies of the core-excited states of Na-like ions has been
presented. RMBPT gives results in good agreement with
experimental and predicted data. It would be beneﬁcial if
experimental data for other highly-charged Na-like ions
were available. At the present time, there are almost

no experimental data between Z=47 and Z=100 for the
sodium isoelectronic sequence. Availability of such data
could lead to an improved understanding of the relative
importance of diﬀerent contributions to the energies of
highly-charged ions. These calculations are presented as
a theoretical benchmark for comparison with experiment
and theory. The present calculations could be further im-
proved by including third-order correlation corrections.

The above representation of the state vector is somewhat inconvenient; for example, it leads to an expression
containing 36 terms for the second-order diagram with six free ends. It was shown in Ref. [23] that it is more eﬃcient
to express the state vector in a manifestly symmetric form in the case of three-electron system. Here, we can only use
symmetry of two particles v and w. As a result, we obtain the expression for the particle-particle-hole contribution

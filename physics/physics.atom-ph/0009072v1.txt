Resonances in the magnetic decoupling curves for the spin
relaxation of dense alkali-metal vapors prove that much of the
relaxation is due to the spin-axis interaction in triplet dimers.
Initial estimates of the spin-axis coupling coeﬃcients for the
dimers (likely accurate to a factor of 2) are |λ|/h = 290 MHz
for Rb; 2500 MHz for Cs.

Hot, dense alkali-metal vapors are used to polarize the
nuclear spins of noble gases, especially 3He and 129Xe,
by spin exchange optical pumping [1]. Applications of
these “hyperpolarized” noble gases in medical imaging
[2] and fundamental physics [3] are of considerable cur-
rent interest. Nevertheless, the basic physical limits to
the eﬃciency of the spin-exchange process are still not
fully understood. Under typical operating conditions of
Rb-3He spin exchange polarizers (saturated Rb vapor at
200◦C in 8 amagat of 3He) about 45% of the Rb spin
depolarization is due to Rb-Rb collisions [4]. Here we re-
port conclusive experimental evidence that much of the
spin relaxation in dense alkali-metal vapors comes from
the spin-axis interaction in triplet dimers. Our measured
spin-axis coupling strengths also impact the ﬁeld of ul-
tracold collisions, where the spin-axis interaction causes
trap-loss and aﬀects the widths and positions of Feshbach
resonances [5,6].

In 1960, Anderson et al. [7] showed that the dominant
eﬀect of binary collisions between alkali-metal atoms is
exchange of the electron spins. In 1974 Gupta et al. [8]
showed that the spin angular momentum of the alkali-
metal atoms was freely exchanged with the nuclear spin
of the singlet dimers, for example, Rb2 and Cs2 (where
nuclear quadrupole interactions cause some spin depo-
larization). In 1980, Bhaskar et al. [9] showed that Cs-
Cs interactions destroy spin at about 1% of of the spin-
exchange rate. The rate coeﬃcient for Cs-induced re-
laxation showed little dependence on buﬀer gas pressure
or species. Relaxation mechanisms in singlet or triplet
dimers were expected to depend strongly on pressure.
Consequently, Bhaskar et al. [9] proposed that the relax-
ation was due to binary collisions between alkali-metal
atoms. They pointed out that although there should be

a spin-rotation interaction, Vsr = γN · S in the triplet
dimers – similar to that postulated by Bernheim [10] –
the coupling coeﬃcient γ was probably too small to ac-
count for relaxation in binary collisions.
Instead, they
suggested that the source of the relaxation was a spin-
axis interaction of the classic form [11]

Vsa =

2λ
3

S · (3ζζ − 1) · S.

(1)

Here S = S1 + S2 is the total electron spin of the col-
liding pair, and ζ is a unit vector along the direction of
the internuclear axis. The spin-axis coupling coeﬃcient
λ = λ(R) arises from both the interaction energy of the
electrons’ magnetic dipole moments and the spin-orbit
interaction in second order [12].

Because Knize’s [13] measurements also showed little
dependence of the Rb-induced relaxation on He or N2
pressure, it came as a surprise when in 1998, Kadlecek,
Anderson and Walker [14] discovered that the relaxation
could be substantially suppressed by externally applied
magnetic ﬁelds of a few thousand Gauss. If the interac-
tion were due to pairs of alkali-metal atoms interacting
on the triplet potential curve, this ﬁeld dependence sets
a lower limit on the correlation time of 40 ps, the in-
verse of the electron Larmor frequency at the decoupling
ﬁeld and a time much longer than the duration of a bi-
nary collision. Similar magnetic decoupling curves for K
and Cs vapors were soon observed in our laboratories at
Wisconsin and Princeton.

Although we still do not understand the relaxation at
He or N2 pressures of an atmosphere or more, recent low-
pressure experiments leave no doubt that an important
part of the spin relaxation in dense alkali-metal vapors
comes from the spin-axis interaction (1), acting in triplet
dimer molecules – even though the triplet dimer density
is no more than 10−6 that of the monomers. The key
experimental observation is the existence of resonances
in the magnetic decoupling curves, resonances which are
predicted from the spin-axis interaction (1), and which
cannot be produced by the spin-rotation interaction or
by spin-1/2 species such as trimer molecules.

A representative arrangement for measuring relaxation
transients in Rb is shown at the top of Fig. 1. The alkali
vapor and N2 buﬀer gas were contained in 1 inch spherical
glass bulbs that were heated in an oven placed between
the pole faces of a 10 kG electromagnet. We measured

the number density of Rb atoms using Faraday rotation
[15] of a tunable diode laser [16].

spin relaxtion of Rb vapor. Bottom. Representative transient
decay curve obtained with the apparatus; at late-times the
transient decay is characterized by a single exponential time
constant.

An intense pulse of 7947 ˚A circularly polarized pump
laser radiation built up the spin polarization for a short
(10 ms) interval. The pump laser was then blocked by
the chopper wheel, and photodiodes monitored the trans-
mission of a weak linearly polarized probe laser through
the cell. The probe beam was resolved into its two
circular components, giving positive and negative helic-
ity signals V±(t) for sampling times t. The signal ra-
tio I(t) = V+(t)/V−(t) greatly suppressed probe-laser
noise. The diﬀerence in the attenuation coeﬃcients of
the two circular components of the probe laser is pro-
portional to the spin polarization P (for P ≪ 1) of the
vapor, so ln I(t) = a + bP (t), where a = ln I(∞) and
b are constants. Fig. 1 shows a typical decay transient
ln ln I(t)/I(∞). For early times, the decay is not expo-
nential since the faster eigenmodes [17] of spin relaxation
are still contributing to the polarization P . However,
at late times there is a time interval, several e-foldings
in length, over which ln ln I(t)/I(∞) is nearly a straight
line with a slope −γ. Thus, when the polarization has
decayed for a suﬃciently long time, it is characterized by
a single, exponential late-time decay rate γ.

The late-time decay rates of polarized Cs vapor in N2
gas were measured as described previously [14], using

same magnetic ﬁelds as anticrossings in the energy level
diagrams. The anticrossings are the result of the spin-
axis interaction (1), acting in a total spin Hamiltonian
for homonuclear triplet dimers of the form

H =

S · I + gsµBBSz −

S · (3nn − 1) · S.

(2)

Here A is the magnetic-dipole hyperﬁne coupling coeﬃ-
cient for the free alkali atoms (A(87Rb)/h = 3, 417.4 MHz
and A(133Cs)/h = 2, 298.2 MHz). The operator for the
total nuclear spin, I = I1 + I2 is the sum of the nuclear
spin operators I1 and I2 for the two atoms. The operator
I · I commutes with (2), and for homonuclear dimers its
eigenvalues I(I + 1) can have I = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 2Im, where
Im = I1 = I2 is the nuclear spin quantum number of a
monomer. The Hamiltonian (2) can therefore be diago-
nalized in a spin subspace I of dimension 3(2I +1) to ﬁnd
eigenfunctions |ii = |Iii and eigenvalues Ei = EIi. For
λ = 0 there is a curious degeneracy in the spin subspace
I 6= 0, with 2I + 1 sublevels crossing at the magnetic
ﬁeld BI = A(2I + 1)/4gSµB. The last term in (2) is the
spin-axis interaction (1), where we assume that the rota-
tional angular momentum N of the dimers is large enough
that we may treat it as a classical vector, pointing along
the unit vector n = N/N , and make the replacement
(3ζζ − 1) → −(3nn − 1)/2.

We estimate the relaxation caused by the interaction
(2) with the following simple model. Let the total longi-
tudinal spin operator of the triplet dimer be Gz = Sz +Iz.
When triplet dimers are formed in dense alkali-metal va-
pors with low spin polarization, the spin density matrix
of the dimers will be very nearly ρ(0) = eβGz /Z, where
β ≈ 4P ≪ 1 is the spin-temperature parameter [7].
The partition function is very nearly Z = 3(2Im + 1)2.
The spin of the dimer at the instant of formation is
therefore hGz0i = 2(I 2
m + Im + 1)β/3, where we have
neglected non-linear terms in the small parameter β.
The mean change in the density matrix by the time it
breaks up again is ∆ρ = hU ρ(0)U −1i − ρ(0), where the
time evolution operator is U = e−iHt/¯h, and the angle
brackets h· · ·i denote an average over all directions of n,
and also an average over the probability e−t/τ dt/τ that
the dimer will break up in the time interval between t
and t + dt. The collisional breakup rate of the dimers
is 1/τ . The mean change in the dimer spin is there-
fore h∆Gzi = Tr{Gz∆ρ} = −W hGz0i, where the spin-
destruction probability is

W = 2Xij

|hi|Gz|ji|2(ωijτ )2

(2Im + 1)2[(2Im + 1)2 + 3][1 + (ωijτ )2]

, (3)

and the Bohr frequencies are ωij = (Ei − Ej )/¯h. An
average over the directions of n is to be understood in (3).
Almost all of the spin is carried by monomers of number
density [Ak] (e.g., [Ak]=[Rb] or [Ak]=[Cs]), which have
a spin density per unit volume [Ak]β(4I 2
m + 4Im + 3)/12.
The spin loss rate per unit volume from triplet dimers

of number density [Ak2] is [Ak2]h∆Gzi/τ , from which
one obtains the relaxation equation −(d/dt) ln β = γ =
κ[Ak], where the rate coeﬃcient is

κ = 2(cid:20) (2Im + 1)2 + 3

(2Im + 1)2 + 2(cid:21) W K

.

(4)

The chemical equilibrium coeﬃcient of the triplet dimers
is K = [Ak2]/[Ak]2. We have used theoretical triplet
dimer potential curves of Krauss and Stevens [18] to es-
timate K(Rb) = 330 ˚A3 and K(Cs) = 650 ˚A3 at repre-
sentative temperatures of 220◦C and 180◦C respectively.

FIG. 3.

Late-time ﬁeld-dependent decay rate of 133Cs
versus magnetic ﬁeld and pressure at 180◦C, [Cs]= 6.6 × 1014
cm−3. The cell temperature was 177 C. The ﬁts to the data
use the reorientation model with negative λ.

Non-vanishing values of λ lift the degeneracy at the
ﬁeld BI and convert the level crossings into anticrossings,
while making the corresponding matrix element hi|Gz|ji
non-zero, as is illustrated in Fig. 2. It is these anticross-
ings of the energy levels that are responsible for the res-
onances, most clearly visible in Fig. 2. Remarkably, the
spin-rotation interaction does not break the degeneracy
so the spin-axis interaction must be responsible for the
relaxation resonances. Since there are 2Im nonvanish-
ing values of I for atoms with the nuclear spin quantum
number Im, we expect there to be 3 resonaces for 87Rb
with Im = 3/2, as observed, and 7 resonances, at ﬁelds
between 600 G and 3100 G for 133Cs with Im = 7/2,
which ﬁts well the observed ﬁeld dependence shown in
Fig 3.

We ﬁt the experimental data to theoretical curves that
include a ﬁeld-independent part due to diﬀusion to the
cells walls and binary collisions, a ﬁeld-dependent nu-
clear quadrupole relaxation in singlet dimers (negligible
for Cs), and relaxation due to the spin-axis interaction

3

in triplet dimers. We expect a small portion of the re-
laxation in triplet dimers to arise from the spin-rotation
interaction, and we may estimate the magnitude of this
relaxation mechanism by assuming that the spin-rotation
interaction of Rb-Rb triplet dimers is the same as that
that of Rb-Kr, and that the spin-rotation interaction for
Cs-Cs is the same as that for Rb-Xe, both of which are ex-
perimentally known from the work of Bouchiat et al. [19].
These estimates should be fairly reliable since the spin-
orbit interaction that produces the spin-rotation coupling
[1] varies only slightly from Rb to Kr or Cs to Xe. Using
these estimates for γN · S, we ﬁnd that the addition of
the spin-rotation interaction causes a few percent change
in the predicted relaxation rates.

In the model described above, the relaxation due to
triplet dimers dependends on two parameters: λ and
the molecular lifetime τ , assuming the theoretical val-
ues for K are accurate. The molecular lifetime should
be inversely proportional to pressure, making it natu-
ral to introduce a cross-section σ = (τ [N2]v)−1. Our
Rb data is well-described over the limited pressure range
from 50 Torr to 300 Torr by the values |λ| = 290 MHz,
and σ = 290 ˚A2. The latter is somewhat larger than
the typical 150 ˚A2 breakup cross sections deduced from
magnetic decoupling studies of RbKr [19]. The sign of λ
cannot be determined from the data.

Since there is little contribution to Cs relaxation from
singlet molecules, relaxation from Cs-Cs triplet molecules
can be observed over a wider range of pressures. Fig. 3
shows a sampling of our spin-relaxation data for Cs as
a function of magnetic ﬁeld at a variety of N2 pressures.
In this case the data are well-described by λ = −2.9
GHz, σ = 98 ˚A2, K = 350 ˚A3, or, assuming the op-
posite sign of λ, λ = 3.4 GHz, σ = 82 ˚A2, K = 307
˚A3. The deduced values of K are about a factor of 2
smaller than predicted from the potential curves (which
are believed to be fairly reliable). We have also ﬁt the
data with a model that allows for collisional reorienta-
tion of the triplet molecules without breakup, making
the assumption that a spin-temperature distribution de-
scribes the dimer density matrix after reorientation. In
this case τ in Eq. 3 is replaced by the coherence time τc,
and W = W τ /(τc + (τ − τc)W ) replaces W in Eq. 4. In
this case we obtain λ = −2.13 GHz, σc = 81 ˚A2, σ = 42
˚A2, K = 584 ˚A3, or λ = 2.71 GHz, σc = 93 ˚A2, σ = 55
˚A2, K = 431 ˚A3. We emphasize that single values of
λ and σc accurately represent the magnetic ﬁeld depen-
dences at 9 pressures (not all shown in Fig 3), covering
nearly two decades in pressure.

Spin-axis coupling in Cs triplet dimers is also of cur-
rent interest for studies of ultracold collisions [5] since it
produces loss of spin-polarized atoms in magnetic traps,
and aﬀects the widths and positions of Feshbach reso-
nances in Cs collisions [6]. The magnitude and sign of
λ, as well as its dependence on interatomic separation R
were predicted by Mies et al. [12]. Previous analysis [5]
led to the conclusion that in order to agree with exper-
iment the second-order spin-orbit calculated by Mies et

al. needed to be scaled by a factor of SC = 4.0 ± 0.5,
recently updated to 3.2 ± 0.5 [6]. We ﬁnd, by averaging
λ(R) over the ro-vibrational levels of the triplet state us-
ing the Krauss and Stevens potentials [18], scaling factors
of SC = 12 for Rb and SC = 3.6 for Cs are needed to
reproduce our data.

In conclusion, the resonances observed in the magnetic
decoupling curves of Rb, coupled with the observed pres-
sure and ﬁeld dependences of Cs, prove that a major con-
tribution to the spin relaxation of hot, dense alkali-metal
vapors is caused by the spin-axis interaction in triplet
dimers. Knowing this key piece of the physics should
help to unravel the still-puzzling independence of the re-
laxation rates on He and N2 pressures of an atmosphere
or more [14].

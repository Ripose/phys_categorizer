Laser cooled 85Rb atoms were optically excited to 46d5/2 Rydberg states. A microwave pulse
transferred a fraction of the atoms to the 47p3/2 Rydberg state. The resonant electric dipole-dipole
interactions between atoms in these two states were probed using the linewidth of the two-photon
microwave transition 46d5/2 − 47d5/2. The presence of a weak magnetic ﬁeld ≈ 0.5 G reduced the
observed line broadening, indicating that the interaction is suppressed by the ﬁeld. The ﬁeld removes
some of the energy degeneracies responsible for the resonant interaction, and this is the basis for a
quantitative model of the resulting suppression. A technique for the calibration of magnetic ﬁeld
strengths using the 34s1/2 − 34p1/2 one-photon transition is also presented.

INTRODUCTION

The interactions between neighboring gas phase atoms
can be enhanced by exciting them to Rydberg states.
To obtain translationally cold interacting Rydberg gases
(≈ 100 µK), laser cooled atoms can be excited [1, 2].
The behavior of these cold Rydberg gases is often quali-
tatively diﬀerent from that of hotter samples (≈ 300 K).
For example, a cold cloud of Rydberg atoms can sponta-
neously evolve into a plasma under conditions in which
a hot cloud could not [3]. Recent theoretical calcula-
tions suggest that cold interacting Rydberg atoms on uni-
formly spaced lattices will show properties analogous to
that of a plasmon wave propagating along metal nanopar-
ticles [4].

Translationally cold Rydberg atoms have recently re-
ceived attention in the context of neutral atom quantum
information processing. Theoretical work has suggested
that Rydberg atom interactions may be used to imple-
ment gates between atoms holding qubits [5], for encod-
ing qubits in multiatom clouds [6], and to implement “on
demand” single-photon sources [7]. Recent experimental
work has demonstrated a suppression of the average Ryd-
berg density due to interactions – so called “local block-
ade” [8, 9], and rapid progress is expected in this area
over the next several years [10].

Transitions between Rydberg states can be driven us-
ing microwave sources, which oﬀer stability, linewidth,
and modulation capabilities unrivaled by lasers. To elu-
cidate the role of multibody interactions in cold Rydberg
gases, Mourachko et al. [11] used microwave radiation to
transfer a fraction of the optically excited Rydberg atoms
into a diﬀerent angular momentum state. Recently, Li et
al. [12] have used a similar microwave redistribution pulse
to establish the role of the electric dipole-dipole interac-
tion in plasma formation from cold Rydberg gases. In
addition, the linewidths of microwave driven transitions
between Rydberg states can be used as a sensitive probe
of interactions between Rydberg atoms [13].

Recently, we have probed the strong resonant electric

dipole-dipole interactions between 85Rb atoms in 45d5/2
and 46p3/2 states using the linewidth of a two-photon
microwave transition from 45d5/2 to 46d5/2 [13]. The
results were consistent with theoretical expectations, and
this approach promises to be a powerful technique for
studying cold Rydberg atom interactions.

How will weak magnetic ﬁelds (≈ 0.5 G) inﬂuence the
interactions between Rydberg atoms? Some of the en-
ergy degeneracies which are responsible for the resonant
electric dipole-dipole interaction observed in Ref. [13] can
be spoiled by application of a magnetic ﬁeld. It may be
desirable to excite neutral atoms to Rydberg states in a
Ioﬀe-Pritchard trap without switching oﬀ the trapping
ﬁelds. Rydberg atoms themselves could also be trapped
using inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds [14].

In the present work we use microwave spectroscopy of
Rydberg atoms to calibrate DC magnetic ﬁeld strengths.
Microwave ﬁelds are then used to manipulate Ryd-
berg populations, and probe interactions, demonstrating
that the dipole-dipole interaction between cold Rydberg
atoms is partially suppressed by magnetic ﬁelds. A quan-
titative model is presented which explains these results.

II. EXPERIMENTAL

The apparatus is similar to that described in Ref. [13].
Cold 85Rb atoms in a vapor-cell magneto-optical trap
(MOT) [15] are excited to high-n Rydberg states using
a pulse of laser light. Microwave pulses are then used
to transfer Rydberg population and probe interactions.
The ﬁnal state populations are analyzed by selective ﬁeld
ionization (SFI) [16]. The signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
the present apparatus and that in Ref. [13] are the laser
excitation source and the control of the magnetic ﬁeld
during the experiment.

Instead of a pulsed dye laser system, a frequency-
doubled cw Ti:sapphire system is used to excite Ryd-
berg states. A commercial Ti:sapphire ring laser (Co-
herent MBR-110) operating at approximately 960 nm is

frequency doubled in an external ring resonator (Coher-
ent MBD-200) to produce approximately 90 mW at 480
nm. Light pulses of 1 µs duration are produced using an
acousto-optic modulator. After the acousto-optic modu-
lator the beam is coupled into a single mode ﬁber. The
output beam from the ﬁber is collimated then focused
and directed towards the trapped atoms. The highest
Rydberg densities (≈ 2 × 107 cm−3) in this paper were
obtained with optical powers of approximately 25 mW.

Excitation of cold atoms to Rydberg states occurs as
a two-color, two-photon process with the 480 nm light,
and the nearly resonant, red detuned 780 nm light used
for cooling and trapping [17]. Unfortunately, there are
several atmospheric water absorption lines in the vicinity
of 960 nm which restrict performance of the Ti:sapphire
laser system. To avoid one of these, we excite 46d5/2
states instead of the 45d5/2 states used in Ref. [13].

Microwave horns are aimed at the Rydberg atoms
through a fused silica window. To drive the 46d5/2 −
47d5/2 (≈ 35.7 GHz), the 46d5/2 − 47p3/2 (≈ 22.1 GHz),
and the 46d5/2 − 45f5/2 (≈ 24.1 GHz) transitions we
directly use the unampliﬁed output of Agilent E8254A
microwave synthesizers. For the 46d5/2 − 46p3/2 (≈
100.1 GHz) and the 34s1/2 − 34p1/2 (≈ 104.1 GHz) tran-
sitions both an active quadrupler (Spacek Labs P/N
A100-4XW) or a passive tripler (Paciﬁc Millimeter P/N
W3WO) were used. These multipliers were driven by an
Agilent E8254A synthesizer.

Two non-magnetic stainless steel electrode plates, sep-
arated by 36mm, are located to either side of the trapped
atoms. These electrodes are used for SFI of Rydberg
atoms [16]. The resultant ions are drawn by the same
ﬁelds through a 6 mm hole in one of the electrode plates
towards a microchannel plate detector. These plates are
also useful for controlling the electric ﬁeld in the experi-
mental region. By varying the relative voltage diﬀerence
of the two plates, their average voltage and the voltage
of the Rb dispenser source with respect to the grounded
chamber, it is possible to compensate for stray electric
ﬁelds in all three directions in the experimental region.
Stray electric ﬁelds are measured using the Stark shifts
of a one-photon microwave transition [18]. The residual
electric ﬁeld is estimated to be less than 0.1 V/cm.

To obtain estimates of the Rydberg density it is nec-
essary to know the number of Rydberg atoms and their
spatial extent. The spatial proﬁle of the 480 nm beam
determines the extent of the Rydberg cloud in two direc-
tions (the focus of this beam is much smaller than the
trapped atom dimensions). Beam characterization can-
not easily be done within the vacuum chamber. Instead,
the rigidly attached output coupler and focusing assem-
bly are moved to an optical table and scanning knife
edge beam proﬁle measurements are performed through-
out the focal region (see for example Ref. [19]). The
beam proﬁle is Gaussian. Since there are collision pro-
cesses which depend on the Rydberg density, the loca-
tion of the tightest focus in the trap can be determined
by moving the focusing lens relative to the trap to max-

2

imize these processes. Once this location is found, the
excitation beam proﬁle can be systematically varied by
moving the focusing lens. The beam was set to have a
full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.190±0.015mm
at the location of the trap.

The extent of the Rydberg cloud in the third dimen-
sion is determined by the trapped atom proﬁle. By scan-
ning the direction of the 480nm excitation laser – moving
the beam over the trapped atom cloud – it is observed
that there is an excellent correlation between the Ryd-
berg signal and 780nm ﬂuoresence imaging measurements
of cloud extent (accounting for the ﬁnite width of the
480 nm beam). Therefore 780 nm ﬂuorescence imaging
gives the spatial extent of the Rydberg cloud in the di-
rection of the 480nm beam propagation. This is typically
0.5 ± 0.1 mm (FWHM).

The beam proﬁle of the 480 nm Rydberg excitation
laser and the spatial proﬁle of the trapped atoms are
combined to convert the observed ﬁeld ionization signals
into spatially averaged Rydberg densities. If the waist of
the excitation laser is signiﬁcantly smaller than the width
of the trap, and this waist does not change appreciably
as the beam passes through the trap (conditions that
are approximately satisﬁed in the present setup) the spa-
tially averaged Rydberg density corresponding to a total
number of Rydberg atoms NRyd is

nRyd =

where FWHM⊥ is the full width at half maximum of the
irradiance proﬁle of the 480 nm light, and FWHMk cor-
responds to the 5p3/2 spatial distribution in the direction
of the 480 nm beam.

Determination of NRyd requires knowledge of the ab-
solute detection eﬃciency and gain of the microchannel
plate detector (MCP). The absolute detection eﬃciency
of an MCP depends on the kinetic energy at impact,
the species involved, and surface conditions [20]. A rec-
ommended eﬃciency for our speciﬁc conditions was not
available. Based on information from the manufacturer
and the literature [20] we estimate an initial detection
eﬃciency of 50% – however this could be as high as 80%
or as low as 20%. The gain of the MCP was calibrated
by observing the average total charge due to single events
at higher bias voltages than normal operating conditions.
To determine gain at the operating bias voltage, a series
of measurements were taken at constant charged particle
signal level with variable bias voltages.

The average densities quoted in this paper are obtained
using Eq. 1. The uncertainty in these is dominated by
NRyd, which is limited by the initial detection eﬃciency
estimate.

III. OBSERVATION OF THE RESONANT
ELECTRIC DIPOLE-DIPOLE INTERACTION

The interactions between 85Rb Rydberg atoms were
studied using the linewidths of the 46d5/2 − 47d5/2 two-
photon “probe” transition. Li et al. [21] have shown
that two-photon transitions between states with identi-
cal gJ factors, such as 46d5/2 and 47d5/2, show negligi-
ble broadening in the inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld of
a MOT. These transitions also have less sensitivity to
electric ﬁelds than one-photon transitions.

The typical experimental sequence for a single shot is
shown in Fig. 1a). Depending on the particular situation,
a “transfer pulse” may be used shortly after optical ex-
citation to drive a fraction of the initially excited 46d5/2
atoms into other states. In the presence of the inhomoge-

3

neous magnetic ﬁeld of the MOT any coherent superposi-
tions formed by this pulse will rapidly dephase across the
sample. Interatomic interactions are somewhat inhomo-
geneous due to the variation in spacings between atoms,
and are also expected to cause appreciable dephasing. As
a consequence the transfer pulse is viewed as redistribut-
ing population rather than creating superpositions.

The 46d5/2 − 47d5/2 probe microwave frequency is
scanned between shots. The power of this probe is ad-
justed so that power broadening is negligible, and in the
limit of low Rydberg densities, the linewidths of this
transition are entirely dominated by transform broad-
ening. To analyze additional broadening due to inter-
atomic eﬀects, the spectra are ﬁt to the transform lim-
2
ited lineshape for a square excitation pulse (sinc
(πf T ))
convolved with a Lorentzian of variable width δν. The
widths of the ﬁtted Lorentzian are then analyzed as
a function of spatially averaged total Rydberg density
(which is normally adjusted using the 480 nm excitation
laser power).

As illustrated in Fig. 2, δν converges to zero as the Ry-
dberg density goes to zero. This indicates that the line
broadening is an interatomic eﬀect. At 1 × 107 cm−3 Ry-
dberg density, transferring one-half of the 46d5/2 atoms
to 47p3/2 broadens the linewidth, increasing δν from ap-
proximately 10 kHz to 120 kHz (the uncertainty in δν is
typically ±7kHz). This can be attributed to the resonant
electric dipole-dipole interaction between atoms in these
two states. Consider a pair of atoms labelled A and B.
In the absence of interactions between these atoms, the
state |46d5/2m5/2>A|47p3/2m3/2>B is energy degenerate
with |47p3/2m3/2 >A |46d5/2m5/2 >B. The dipole-dipole
interaction breaks this degeneracy, leading to an energy
splitting on the order of

∆νdd ≈

| < 46d5/2|r|47p3/2 > |2
R3

AB

(2)

where r is the separation of Rydberg electron from the
ion-core, and RAB is the typical interatomic spacing [23,
24].

The value of | < 46d5/2|r|47p3/2 > | and other rele-
vant radial transition dipole moments are indicated in
Fig. 1b). For instance, the dipole coupling between the
47d5/2 and 47p3/2 states is relatively weak compared to
the coupling between the 46d5/2 and 47p3/2 states. Thus
the broadening of the two-photon 46d5/2 − 47d5/2 probe
transition beyond the transform limit is dominated by
dipole-dipole energy splittings in the initial state. As in
Ref. [13], a simple estimate based on Eq. 2 is consistent
with the observed broadening. The 1/R3
AB scaling of the
splittings implies a linear density dependence of the line
broadening, which is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 2a).

The dipole-dipole coupling between 46d5/2 and 45f
states is of comparable magnitude to that between 46d5/2
and 47p3/2 states (see Fig. 1b). Consequently, transfer of
a fraction of atoms to the 45f state gives similar broad-
ening (see Fig. 2b).

It is also straightforward to drive transitions to a
nearby state which is not strongly dipole coupled to ei-
ther the initial or ﬁnal state of the two-photon probe
transition. Based on the radial dipole matrix elements
we would expect 4 orders of magnitude less broadening
if 50% of the atoms were transferred to 46p3/2 instead
of 47p3/2. As Fig. 2b) indicates, there is no detectable
broadening of the probe transition in the presence of
46p3/2 atoms.

These results are similar to those presented in Ref. [13]
(only at one higher principal quantum number). There
is a slight increase in linewidth of ≈ 20% in a mixture
of nd5/2 and (n + 1)p3/2 atoms (where n = 46 here, and
n = 45 in Ref. [13]). The energy splittings ∆νdd scale
like n4 due to the n2 scaling of the transition dipole mo-
ments [16], and this accounts for about a 10 % increase.
We have also made changes in our Rydberg density es-
timate procedure, and these may also account for the
discrepency. The more signiﬁcant diﬀerence is in the
linewidths obtained when no transfer pulse is present (see
Fig. 2). There is roughly 3 times less broadening as com-
pared to the data presented in Ref. [13].

The source of broadening in the case of no transfer
pulse was proposed to be due to the collision of hot Ryd-
berg atoms (≈ 300 K) with the cold Rydberg atoms [13].
These types of collisions have also been discussed in the
context of cold plasma formation [25]. The hot atoms are
excited in the same way as the cold trapped atoms. They
make an undetectable contribution to the observed ﬁeld
ionization because the waiting period between excitation
and extraction allows them to move to where they can’t
be detected.

Several experimental tests support the role of the hot
Rydberg atoms in line broadening. To control the hot
background Rb number density, the current through an
alkali metal dispenser source is varied [26]. When the hot
Rb background density is varied in this manner, the 480
nm excitation laser power should be adjusted to produce
the same cold Rydberg density (compensating for the
diﬀerent trapped atom density). The time constant is
relatively long for changes in background pressure with
dispenser current (on the order of 10 minutes), so we can
check independently of background Rb pressure whether
thermal radiation or charged particles from the dispenser
are responsible for broadening. At our sensitivity, no
such eﬀects were found.

With constant cold Rydberg density, it is found that
δν increases with hot Rb background density. This rules
out the interactions between cold Rydberg atoms as be-
ing responsible for the broadening. However, at higher
densities than those studied here, the nearly resonant
interactions 46d5/246d5/2 ↔ 48p3/244f between cold Ry-
dberg atoms will become increasingly important [12]. At
a ﬁxed hot Rb background density, δν is proportional
to 480 nm excitation laser power, which rules out the
inﬂuence of unexcited hot atoms.

Not only does the hot Rydberg atom density in-
crease with background Rb pressure, but so does the

for the deﬁnition of δν.

trapped atom density. This suggests a check to deter-
mine whether interactions with less excited cold atoms,
or with hot Rydberg atoms from the vapor, are the cause
of the increased broadening. If the cooling and trapping
laser frequency is detuned to obtain less cold atoms, and
the 480 nm laser power is increased to obtain the same
cold Rydberg density, the observed linewidths increase,
because more hot atoms are optically excited to Rydberg
states. If less excited cold atoms were responsible for the
broadening we would expect a decrease in linewidth.

In summary, the broadening δν observed with no trans-
fer pulse is due to the collision of hot Rydberg atoms
with the cold Rydberg atoms we are studying.
In the
present work δν in the absence of a transfer pulse is
smaller than in Ref.
[13] for at least two reasons. We
are now working at lower dispenser currents (correspond-
ing to lower background pressures) and using a 480 nm
excitation source with signiﬁcantly narrower bandwidth.
The reduced bandwidth is expected to alter the ratio of
cold to hot Rydberg atoms.

By working with a low hot Rb background pressure,
and at 107 cm−3 total Rydberg density, δν is on the or-
der of its experimental uncertainty ±7 kHz. We have not
yet established what the ultimate limit on the lowest δν
is, and thus the ultimate sensitivity of the probe tran-
sition to Rydberg interactions. However, the currently
demonstrated sensitivity is vastly superior to what can
readily be achieved with optical probes.

IV. MAGNETIC FIELD MEASUREMENTS

In this section we discuss the use of a single-photon
microwave transition between Rydberg states to measure
magnetic ﬁelds.

The MOT used to trap the 85Rb atoms requires a mag-
netic quadrupole ﬁeld [15]. In these experiments the ﬁeld
gradients in the three orthogonal directions are estimated
to be 12, 12 and 24 G/cm, based on the coil geometry.
The Rydberg cloud has a Gaussian proﬁle with FWHM’s
of 0.190 ± 0.015 mm in two dimensions (dictated by the
480 nm excitation laser) and 0.5 ± 0.1 mm in the third
dimension (dictated by the trap size). The largest dimen-
sion corresponds to the direction of the largest magnetic
ﬁeld gradient. This gives a root mean square (RMS) mag-
netic ﬁeld of approximately 0.5 G. Since Zeeman shifts
are typically on the order of 1 MHz/G, and the dipole-
dipole interactions that we observe are roughly 100 kHz,
it is apparent that the quadrupole ﬁeld is a signiﬁcant in-
homogeneity, and it is desirable to turn this oﬀ. The cur-
rent in the coils producing this ﬁeld is shut oﬀ in 1.7 ms,
but signiﬁcant eddy currents persist for much longer (see,
for example, Ref. [27]). Excitation to Rydberg states oc-
curs after a delay of 25 ms, to allow the eddy currents to
die down (see Fig. 3). As will be discussed, an upper
bound can be placed on any remaining inhomogeneity.

The detuning and counterpropagating beam balance of
the MOT lasers are optimized to minimize the reduction
in cold atom density during the 25ms delay. Immediately
after selective ﬁeld ionization is complete, the current to
the quadrupole coils is turned back on to recapture cold
atoms for the next shot.

Once the quadrupole ﬁeld is turned oﬀ, a DC magnetic
ﬁeld may remain. Three pairs of orthogonal Helmholtz
coils are used to null any preexisting ﬁeld (due to the ion-
pump, earth etc...) and one of these coil pairs is used to
produce a deliberate homogeneous ﬁeld. The current in
the coils is constant throughout the MOT collection, Ry-
dberg excitation, and microwave probe cycle. When set-
ting a non-zero homogeneous ﬁeld, the quadrupole zero
of the MOT will be shifted. As long as the quadrupole
zero remains signiﬁcantly within the overlap of the cool-
ing and trapping beams, the trap will still function. The
use of ﬁelds of up to 0.6 G pointing in the direction with
a ﬁeld gradient of 12 G/cm, shifts the zero by 0.5 mm,
which does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence MOT operation
when using 780 nm beams with a FWHM of 4 mm. Loss
of the cold atoms in the 25 ms waiting period limits the
DC bias ﬁelds which can be applied using this technique.
Although it is straightforward to calculate the ﬁelds
due to the bias coils from their geometries, we do not a
priori know the stray magnetic ﬁeld within the appara-
tus. To determine this, the one-photon microwave transi-
tion 34s1/2−34p1/2 of 85Rb is used. We work at a lower n
compared to where the dipole-dipole experiment is per-
formed so that the hyperﬁne spacings are larger (these
scale like 1/n3, see Ref. [16]). To improve the sensitivity
of the measurement it is desirable to use long microwave

FIG. 3: Timing for experiments done in the presence of a
homogeneous DC magnetic ﬁeld. The quadrupole ﬁeld coil
current is cut to zero in 1.7 ms. As the magnetic ﬁeld gradi-
ent ∂Bx/∂x decays to zero, the ﬁeld in the center of the trap
Bx gradually increases due to the presence of a non-zero ho-
mogeneous bias ﬁeld. At t = 0, excitation to Rydberg states
and subsequent microwave probing takes place, as shown in
Fig. 1. The gradient and bias ﬁeld time constant was mea-
sured using Rydberg atom microwave spectroscopy (see text).

pulse lengths (for narrow linewidths). Redistribution of
Rydberg state population due to thermal radiation, lim-
its the microwave pulse length. Pulses of 36 µs are used.
The Zeeman splittings of the relevant levels are shown
in Fig. 4. The 780 nm light used for optical excitation is
nearly resonant with only the 5s1/2F = 3 to 5p3/2F = 4
transition. Since F cannot change by more than one in a
single photon transition, the 34s1/2F = 2 state is not ex-
cited in zero magnetic ﬁeld, and only two microwave spec-
tral lines are observable: 34s1/2, F = 3 to 34p1/2, F = 2
and 34s1/2, F = 3 to 34p1/2, F = 3 (see Fig. 5).

As a magnetic ﬁeld is applied, this spectrum splits into
many lines. To zero the magnetic ﬁeld in a speciﬁc di-
rection the following procedure is followed. A current is
applied to a set of coils to produce a relatively large mag-
netic ﬁeld (the precise value is unknown at this point).
By scanning the microwave frequency, a spectrum with
many lines can be observed (see Fig. 5). Then we deter-
mine the current which produces the same ﬁeld magni-
tude in the opposite direction, by trying to reproduce the
spectral line positions. The average of these two currents
corresponds to zero ﬁeld projection along this axis. Us-
ing this procedure all three orthogonal axes can be zeroed
independently. Since the change in magnetic ﬁeld with
current can be estimated from coil geometry, the pre-
cision to which the average currents can be determined
can be directly related to the precision to which the ﬁelds
can be compensated. We have zeroed the magnetic ﬁeld
along each axis to within ±6 mG using this technique.

34p1/2 levels of 85Rb using the Breit-Rabi formulae [28] (the
mJ labelling is approximate). Please note the diﬀerent ver-
tical scalings. The two hyperﬁne splittings are chosen to
match the spectral lines in Fig. 5 (0.567 MHz for 34s1/2, and
0.147 MHz for 34p1/2). The arrow labels the 34s1/2(mF = −3)
to 34p1/2(mF = −3) line, which is used for magnetic ﬁeld cal-
ibration (see text).

To deliberately create magnetic ﬁelds in a speciﬁc di-
rection, one of the coil currents was adjusted away from
its “zero” value. The change in magnetic ﬁeld with coil
current can be estimated from the coil geometry. How-
ever, the line positions in the 34s1/2 − 34p1/2 spectra (see
Fig. 5) can be used to directly measure the ﬁeld. The
shifting of energies is given by the Breit-Rabi formulae
(see, for example Ref. [28]). In general, line positions are
dependent on the magnetic ﬁeld, and the hyperﬁne split-
ting of both the 34s1/2 and 34p1/2 states. The 34s1/2
hyperﬁne spacing is not known a priori. However, there
is a particular line (marked with arrows in Fig. 5), cor-
responding to the transition from 34s1/2(mF = −3) to
34p1/2(mF = −3) whose shift in position with magnetic
ﬁeld does not depend on the hyperﬁne spacing. The tran-

with diﬀerent DC magnetic ﬁelds (top 7 traces) and with the
MOT quadrupole ﬁeld present (bottom trace). Spectra are
oﬀset vertically for clarity. The calculated line positions of
the ∆mF = 0 transitions using the energy levels from Fig. 4
are shown for the 0.65 G data (the microwave polarization
vector is in same direction as the applied magnetic ﬁeld). The
arrow labels the 34s1/2(mF = −3) to 34p1/2(mF = −3) line,
which is used for magnetic ﬁeld calibration (see text).

sition energy for this line is (2/3)µBB, where µB is the
Bohr magneton and B is the magnetic ﬁeld. As apparent
in Fig. 5 this line is convenient as it is readily identifable
in the spectra. By tabulating the position of this spec-
tral line as a function of coil current and ﬁtting a straight
line, the magnetic ﬁeld as a function of coil current can
be determined, without knowledge of the 34s1/2 hyper-
ﬁne splitting. This provides a precise determination of
the magnetic ﬁeld (±10 mG). The dipole-dipole interac-
tion is then studied under these calibrated magnetic ﬁeld
conditions.

It is desirable to know the inhomogeneity in the mag-
netic ﬁeld when the experiment is performed. The bot-
tom trace in Fig. 5 shows inhomogeneous broadening due
to the quadrupole ﬁeld when the coil current is not shut
oﬀ. By varying the time between between shutting the
current oﬀ and excitation of the atoms to Rydberg states
(see Fig. 3) we can observe the decay of this inhomogene-
ity using the spectral widths. The decay is observed to
be exponential with a time constant of 6 ± 1 ms. A gauss-

meter on the outside of the vacuum chamber, placed as
close as possible to the experimental region (within 15cm)
shows a similar time constant for the change in magnetic
ﬁeld: 6.5 ± 0.5 ms.

At the start of this section, the RMS magnetic ﬁeld
due to the quadrupole ﬁeld was calculated to be 0.5 G.
Based on the exponential decay of the gradient, 25 ms
after the coil currents are shut-oﬀ we would expect this
to decay to 8 mG. This inhomogeneity is insigniﬁcant
in the dipole-dipole interaction experiments discussed in
the next section.

The widths of the resolved 34s1/2(mF = −3) to
34p1/2(mF = −3) spectral lines in Fig. 5 put an upper
bound on the magnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneity. The lines
are observed to have a linewidth of 30 kHz. The trans-
form limited linewidth for a 36 µs long pulse is approx-
imately 25 kHz. If as a worst case we assume that the
linewidth contributions combine in quadrature, the resid-
ual broadening due to magnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneity and
other mechanisms is 17 kHz. This gives a rough upper
bound of 17 mG on the magnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneity,
which is consistent with the estimate given in the previ-
ous paragraph.

V. SUPPRESSION OF THE RESONANT
ELECTRIC DIPOLE-DIPOLE INTERACTION
DUE TO A MAGNETIC FIELD

Using the techniques described in the previous section,
cold Rydberg atom interactions can be studied in the
presence of homogeneous, calibrated magnetic ﬁelds. The
timing of the experiment remains the same as in Fig. 1a).
However, the current to the quadrupole coils is shut-oﬀ
25 ms prior to photoexcitation (see Fig. 3). During this
waiting period, the cold atom cloud dimensions expand.
At each diﬀerent applied magnetic ﬁeld value, the coun-
terpropagating beam powers are re-optimized to mini-
mize expansion. When this is done, it is found that trap
expansion is independent of DC magnetic ﬁeld to within
10% for ﬁelds less than 0.6 G, and linewidth broadening
can be studied at a ﬁxed Rydberg density as a function
of magnetic ﬁeld.

The linewidth broadening due to interatomic eﬀects,
δν is obtained in exactly the same manner as described
in Section III. In the limit of low densities δν approaches
zero for all DC magnetic ﬁelds, indicating that it is due to
interatomic interactions. At an average Rydberg density
of 8.0 × 106 cm−3 we have found that conversion of 50 %
of the 46d5/2 atoms to 47p3/2 increases δν from 10 kHz
to 110 kHz at approximately 0.04 G. As Fig. 6 indicates,
increasing the magnetic ﬁeld reduces δν. The presence of
a DC magnetic ﬁeld suppresses the resonant dipole-dipole
interaction between atoms. Essentially the magnetic ﬁeld
spoils some of the unperturbed atom energy degeneracies,
weakening the resonant interaction.

To discuss this in detail, we consider the dipole-dipole

where ~µA and ~µB are the electric dipole matrix element
operators evaluated on each atom, ~n is the unit vector
pointing between the atoms, and RAB is the separation
of the two atoms.

The tensor product of the separated, non-interacting
atom energy eigenstates can be used as a basis set for
the evaluation of ˆVdd. The axis of quantization for the
projection of the angular momentum of each atom is cho-
sen to point in the same direction as the magnetic ﬁeld.
This is in contrast to the more conventional choice for
interatomic interactions, where the quantization axis is
chosen along ~n (see, for example, Ref. [29]). This choice
complicates the evaluation of the matrix elements of ˆVdd,
but simpliﬁes the evaluation of the Zeeman part of the
Hamiltonian.

If we label each atom as A and B, in zero magnetic ﬁeld
with no dipole-dipole interaction, all 24 states of the form
|1>=|46d5/2mj,A1>A|47p3/2mj,B1>B are energy degener-
ate with the 24 states of the form |2>=|47p3/2mj,A2>A
|46d5/2mj,B2>B. It is this degeneracy which is responsi-
ble for the resonant electric dipole-dipole line broadening.

form given above, then:

<ψb| ˆVZ |ψb>= (gjAmjA + gjBmjB)µBB

(4)

where gj is given by the standard formula (gj = 4/3 for
the 2p3/2 states, and gj = 6/5 for the 2d5/2 states [28]).
In this basis set, with the axis of quantization along the
direction of the magnetic ﬁeld, there are no oﬀ-diagonal
elements of ˆVZ .

momentum quantization is in the direction of ~B (see text).

the techniques described in Ref. [22]. The Zeeman energy

Once a magnetic ﬁeld is applied only pairs of states for
which mj,A1 = mj,B2 and mj,B1 = mj,A2, are degenerate.
As an example, consider the state |46d5/2mj = 1/2 >A
|47p3/2mj = 1/2>B. This is coupled by ˆVdd to several
states, as shown in Table I. These states are all energy
degenerate in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld and interac-
tions. Once a magnetic ﬁeld is applied only one coupled
state has an identical Zeeman shift and remains degen-
erate: |47p3/2mj = 1/2>A|46d5/2mj = 1/2>B. Since the
application of a magnetic ﬁeld lowers the energy degen-
eracy, we expect less line broadening since some of the
dipole-dipole couplings are no longer resonant.

A quantitative treatment of the resulting linewidth
suppression will now be considered. The essence of this
treatment is the numerical diagonalization of a Hamilto-
nian using a basis set of two atom states – the 24+24 = 48
states mentioned above. All of these 48 states are energy
degenerate in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld and dipole-
dipole interactions, so the simpliﬁed Hamiltonian is

ˆH = ˆVZ + ˆVdd.

(5)

This corresponds to a 48 by 48 matrix for ﬁxed values of
~n, RAB and B. The matrix elements of ˆVdd require the
transition dipole moments ~µA and ~µB (see Eq. 3), which
can be evaluated using numerical integration of the Ryd-
berg electron wave-functions [22]. The matrix elements of
ˆVZ are obtained from Eq. 4. The resulting Hamiltonian
matrix may be numerically diagonalized, yielding a set
of energy eigenvalues Ei and corresponding eigenvectors
|ψi>.

As has been discussed, the two-photon probe transi-
tion is not sensitive to the Zeeman eﬀect [21]. Thus for
a correspondence with the spectral transition energies,
the Zeeman energy contribution is subtracted from each
eigenvalue:

Eci = Ei− <ψi| ˆVZ |ψi> .

(6)

This heuristic expression is based on the observation that

8

the probe linewidth is independent of magnetic ﬁeld in
the absence of interatomic eﬀects. An exact treatment
would take into account relative linestrengths in the two-
photon probe transition.

The corrected energies Eci may be computed as a func-
tion of magnetic ﬁeld magnitude for a ﬁxed RAB and
relative orientation of ~n and ~B. The distribution of the
corrected energies dictates the linewidth broadening. If
there was no dipole-dipole interaction these would all be
zero. The spread in the corrected energies decreases with
magnetic ﬁeld – the magnetic ﬁeld suppresses the dipole-
dipole interaction. To quantify this with a single number,
we have computed the root mean square (RMS) corrected
energy <E2
ci>1/2 as a function of magnetic ﬁeld for ~n ⊥ ~B
and ~n k ~B at a ﬁxed value of RAB (see Fig. 7).

The qualititative diﬀerence in the suppression for ~n ⊥
~B and ~n k ~B may be understood from the diﬀerence in
the selection rules for ˆVdd in these two cases. When ~n
is parallel to the quantization axis ( ~B), the dipole-dipole
interaction ˆVdd does not couple states of diﬀerent mj,tot,
where mj,tot = mj,A + mj,B. This is a consequence of the
invariance of ˆVdd to rotations about ~n. However the same
selection rule does not exist when ~n is perpendicular to
the quantization axis (see, for example, Table I). Due
to the similarity in gj factors for the 2p3/2 and 2d5/2
states (4/3 vs. 6/5) the Zeeman shifts for states of the
same mj,tot are quite similar when compared to states of
diﬀerent mj,tot (see the last column of Table I). Therefore
the degeneracy between states coupled by ˆVdd with ~n k ~B
is spoiled at much higher ﬁelds than for ~n ⊥ ~B. If Fig. 7
ci >1/2 for ~n k ~B
is extended to higher ﬁelds, then < E2
eventually drops to 67 kHz.

In the sample both ~n and RAB are distributed ran-
domly. The nearest neighbor probability distribution is
given by [30]:

dP (RAB)
dRAB

= 4πR2

ABnint exp(−4πR3

ABnint/3).

(7)

The number density nint in this expression is half of
the total Rydberg density – as half of the atoms reso-
nantly interact with the other half in an even mixture
of 46d5/2 and 47p3/2 atoms. Using this expression and
random orientations of ~n, we have calculated the prob-
ability distribution of the corrected eigenvalues. These
distributions were convolved with a sinc2(πf T ) lineshape
(T = 6 µs) and ﬁtted in the same manner as the exper-
2
imental data (using the sinc
(πf T ) lineshape convolved
with a Lorentzian of adjustable width δν).

To make a comparison with the experimental observa-
tions, the calculations must be done at a speciﬁc number
density. As discussed, our experimental density determi-
nation is uncertain by almost a factor of 2. Therefore
the density used in the calculations is adjusted for the
best ﬁt to the data. This is the only adjustable parame-
ter in the calculations, and we use the same adjustment
factor for both densities in Fig. 6. Speciﬁcally, at the

28.5 µm, the most probable resonantly interacting neighbor
−3. Calcu-
distance at a total Rydberg density of 1.4 × 107 cm
lations are shown for two diﬀerent relative orientations of the
magnetic ﬁeld ~B, and the unit vector pointing between the
two atoms ~n.

higher density the calculations are performed at a con-
stant Rydberg density of 1.4 × 107 cm−3, whereas the
spatially averaged experimental density is estimated to
be (0.8 ± 0.5) × 107 cm−3. The discrepency may be an
indication of the importance of multi-body interactions,
which are expected to enhance the interactions over a
simple binary model.

The calculations shown in Fig. 6 predict a reduction in
linewidths with magnetic ﬁeld comparable to the obser-
vations. However the agreement is not perfect. In partic-
ular, the experimental results appear to extrapolate to a
lower linewidth at zero magnetic ﬁeld. There are several
possible reasons for this. Hyperﬁne structure has been
neglected. This is expected to be especially important at
low magnetic ﬁelds where the Zeeman shifts are smaller
than the hyperﬁne splitting. In addition, stray electric
ﬁelds break degeneracies between states of diﬀerent |mj|,
and this is also expected to suppress linewidth.

The distribution of energy eigenvalues of the two
atom system has been used to obtain linewidths – but
linestrengths for the diﬀerent transitions should be ac-
counted for. In addition, not all of the eigenstates will
be equally populated by the excitation scheme.

Perhaps the most signiﬁcant problem with the theoret-
ical model is the assumption of binary interactions: only
pairs of atoms interact. Experimental observations of res-

9

onant energy transfer between cold Rydberg atoms have
demonstrated that this picture is not complete [1, 11].
Taking these into account would require a much more
sophisticated approach [4, 31].

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The magnetic ﬁeld induced partial suppression of the
resonant electric dipole-dipole interaction between cold
Rydberg atoms has been observed, and a quantitative
model of this phenomena has been presented. This model
could be tested in more detail. A “one-dimensional sam-
ple” has recently been successfully employed to determine
the inﬂuence of the relative orientation of an electric ﬁeld
with ~n on Rydberg dipole-dipole interactions [32]. By fo-
cusing the Rydberg state excitation laser more tightly, so
that the average interatomic separation is larger than the
beam waist, the sample becomes one dimensional [32].
This gives a preferred direction to ~n in the lab-frame, and
thus makes it possible to study interactions with ~B ⊥ ~n
or ~B k ~n. As Fig. 7 indicates, there should be a dramatic
diﬀerence between these two cases, which would provide
a useful check.

Homogeneous DC magnetic ﬁelds cannot completely
remove the energy degeneracies responsible for the reso-
nant dipole-dipole interaction. For example, in the ab-
sence of interactions |46d5/2m5/2 >A |47p3/2m3/2 >B is
energy degenerate with |47p3/2m3/2 >A |46d5/2m5/2 >B
independent of magnetic ﬁeld. For complete suppression
of the dipole-dipole interaction it is interesting to con-
sider the use of magnetic ﬁeld gradients. By making the
energy levels of the atoms depend on position, the reso-
nance conditions can be completely spoiled. Strong mag-
netic ﬁeld gradients have recently been used in electron
spin resonance (ESR) to suppress spin diﬀusion due to
the magnetic dipolar ﬂip-ﬂop interaction [33]. An anal-
ogous experiment could be performed in the case of res-
onant electric dipole-dipole interactions. The required
ﬁeld gradient is modest. For example, in the present
work we typically have 100 kHz interaction strengths at
interatomic separations of 30 µm. With Zeeman shifts
typically being on the order of 1 MHz/G, ﬁeld gradients
of roughly 50 G/cm should give signiﬁcant supression.
These gradients are readily achievable – in magnetic mi-
crotraps for example [34]. Strong magnetic ﬁeld gradients
could be useful for suppression of resonant dipole-dipole
interactions in situations where they are undesirable.

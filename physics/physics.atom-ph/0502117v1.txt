Abstract

This paper describes advances in microwave frequency standards
using laser-cooled atoms at BNM-SYRTE. First, recent improvements
of the 133Cs and 87Rb atomic fountains are described. Thanks to
the routine use of a cryogenic sapphire oscillator as an ultra-stable
local frequency reference, a fountain frequency instability of 1.6
×
10−14τ −1/2 where τ is the measurement time in seconds is measured.
The second advance is a powerful method to control the frequency
shift due to cold collisions. These two advances lead to a frequency
10−16 at 50 000 s for the ﬁrst time for primary stan-
stability of 2
dards. In addition, these clocks realize the SI second with an accuracy
10−16, one order of magnitude below that of uncooled devices.

In a second part, we describe tests of possible variations of funda-
mental constants using 87Rb and 133Cs fountains. Finally we give an
update on the cold atom space clock PHARAO developed in collab-
oration with CNES. This clock is one of the main instruments of the
ACES/ESA mission which is scheduled to ﬂy on board the Interna-
tional Space Station in 2008, enabling a new generation of relativity

1 Introduction: Einstein’s legacy in modern

clocks

Modern clocks using laser cooled atoms owe a great deal to the famous 1905
”annus mirabilis” of Einstein.
Indeed the three theoretical problems that
Einstein beautifully solved in 1905 are key ingredients in current atomic
clocks, hundred years after Einstein’s work.

1. First the quanta of light, photons, are routinely used to cool atoms to
microkelvin temperatures and to conﬁne them in electromagnetic traps.
Atom manipulation is a direct application of energy and momentum
exchanges between light and matter. At one microkelvin, cesium atoms
which form the basis for the current deﬁnition of the SI unit of time, the
second, move at an average speed of 7 mm.s−1, enabling extremely long
observation times and thus precision measurements. On Earth, atomic
fountains enable unperturbed ballistic ﬂight with duration approaching
one second. Furthermore, every experiment in atomic physics routinely
uses the Einstein’s photoelectric eﬀect in photodiodes to detect, and
control light beams. Furthermore, the concept of photon is intimately
connected to the famous Planck relationship E = hν between energy,
Planck’s constant and frequency of electromagnetic radiation, which is
of paramount importance in atomic clocks.

2. Second Einstein’s theory of brownien motion with the famous relation-
ship kBT = D/α between temperature, diﬀusion coeﬃcient and friction
coeﬃcient not only proved the existence of atoms, but beautifully ap-
plies to Doppler and sub-Doppler laser cooling mechanisms at work in
every cold atom experiment [1]. In optical molasses atoms are viscously
conﬁned by the bath of photons, they experience a three-dimensional
random walk in position and storage times in excess of 10 seconds have
been observed for this brownien motion.

3. Third Einstein’s theory of special (and later general) relativity intro-
duced a new approach relating space and time, and the fundamental
concept of relativistic invariance and Lorentz transformation. Einstein
predicted that time in a fast moving frame seems to slow down to some-
one not moving with it, and distances appear shorter. This revolution-
ary approach had major fundamental as well as practical consequences
in the following century. Clocks in diﬀerent reference frames tick at dif-
ferent rates and the well-known GPS receivers which equip boats, cars,
and planes use routinely Einstein’s relativity to determine their posi-
tion with 10 meter accuracy. Indeed, the atomic clocks onboard the 24

2

GPS satellites orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 20 000 kms must be
corrected for relativistic eﬀects (time dilation and gravitational shift)
in order to be synchronized with ground clocks and to reach this posi-
tioning accuracy. The correction is about 38 microseconds per day. If
each satellite would not apply this compensation the positioning error
would reach 11 kilometers per day !

These three papers have had revolutionary consequences in Science and
society.

Historically, clocks have played a major role in tests of predictions of
relativity theories, from the Hafele-Keating clock transport in jet planes,
the Pound-Rebka gravitational shift measurement, the Vessot-Levine GP-
A Space hydrogen maser red-shift measurement, and radar ranging Shapiro
delay experiment [2]. In addition the current deﬁnition of time in the SI unit
system, the second, relies on Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP). This
principle is the foundation for all gravitational metric theories that describe
gravity as a consequence of curved space-time. The Einstein Equivalence
Principle states [2]:

1. if an uncharged test body is placed at an initial event in spacetime and
given an initial velocity there, then its subsequent trajectory will be
independent of its internal structure and composition

2. In any freely falling frame, the outcome of any local non gravitational

test experiments is independent of the velocity of the frame

3. the outcome of any local non gravitational test experiment is indepen-

dent of where and when in the universe it is performed

An immediate consequence of EEP is that the fundamental constants of
physics such as the gravitational constant G, or the ﬁne structure constant
α = e2/4πǫ0~c must be independent of time and space.

In this article we ﬁrst describe recent progress in the realization of the SI
second using laser cooled cesium and rubidium clocks. In a second part we
use these highly stable devices to perform new tests of Einstein Equivalence
Principle, namely the constancy of fundamental constants.

2 Atomic Fountains

The ever increasing control of the motion of atomic samples is at the origin
of recent progress in atomic frequency standards and precision measurements

3

[3]. Laser cooled and trapped atoms enable long observation times required
for high precision measurements. Charged particles conﬁned in Paul or Pen-
ning traps oﬀer extremely long storage enabling high precision mass mea-
surements, fundamental tests, and the realization of ultra-stable microwave
and optical clocks. The recent NPL frequency measurement of an optical
transition in Sr+ ion with an uncertainty of 3 10−15 [4] is only a factor three
or four worse than the current accuracy of cesium fountains. Precision mea-
surements with neutral atoms on the other hand are usually performed in
an atomic fountain where laser cooled atoms ballistically propagate for dura-
tions up to one second. In the last decade, atomic clocks and inertial sensors
using matter wave interferometry in fountains have become two of the most
important applications of cold atoms [3, 5]. About two dozens of fountain
devices are now used for a variety of applications. It has been shown recently
that microwave and optical clocks as well as matter-wave inertial sensors be-
long to the same general class of atom interferometers [6]. As an example the
current sensitivity in acceleration measurement with atom interferometers is
10−8 m.s−2 in one minute measurement duration and, in a
on the order of 3
decade, cesium fountain clocks have gained almost two orders of magnitude
in accuracy. As we show in this paper the fractional inaccuracy of the BNM-
10−16 which
SYRTE fountains at Paris Observatory do not exceed today 7
corresponds to less than a single second error over 50 million years, allowing
for the realization of SI unit of time, the second, at the same level. About
half a dozen fountains throughout the world at metrology institutes including
PTB, NIST, IEN, NPL, have now an accuracy near 10−15, making fountains
a major contributor to the accuracy of the TAI (Temps Atomique Interna-
tional). In the future, many applications, such as positioning systems (GPS,
GALILEO, GLONASS) as well as scientiﬁc applications will beneﬁt from
these developments. For instance, deep space satellites have travel durations
of several years across the solar system. Precise monitoring of their position
requires timescales with very low long term drift. Also, using advanced time
and frequency transfer systems (operating at higher carrier frequency and
chip rate and/or using two way transfer techniques) may lead to positioning
accuracy at the millimeter level for averaging time of a few hundred seconds.
This would impact many geodetic applications.

×

×

In this paper we show that prospects for further improvements are im-
portant. A frequency comparison between two fountains exhibits a stability
of 2 10−16 at 50 000 second averaging time, for the ﬁrst time for atomic stan-
dards. This frequency resolution sets the stage for clock accuracy at the
10−16 level for cesium, almost one order of magnitude potential gain, and
even better for rubidium with its far reduced collision shift [7, 8]. We be-
gin by recalling the basic operation of fountain atomic clocks and introduce

4

×

several new techniques which demonstrate frequency measurements with a
frequency resolution at the 10−16 level. The ﬁrst technique makes use of
an ultra-stable cryogenic oscillator to interrogate the clock transition in the
fountain. Thanks to its extremely good short term frequency stability and
low phase noise, the frequency stability of cesium and rubidium fountains is
one order of magnitude below that of fountains using an ultra-stable quartz
10−14 τ −1/2
oscillator as interrogation oscillator. It currently reaches 1.6
where τ is the averaging time in seconds. The fundamental quantum noise
of the clock is now reached with atomic samples of up to 107 atoms. The
second advance deals with a new technique to measure and cancel with high
precision the collisional shift in the clock. This shift is a major plague in
cesium clocks and is much reduced (two orders of magnitude) in rubidium
devices [7, 8]. The method uses interrupted adiabatic population transfer
to prepare precise ratios of atomic densities. We show here that the cesium
collisional shift can be measured and cancelled at the 10−3 level. By com-
paring rubidium and cesium fountains over a duration of six years, a new
upper limit for the drift of fundamental constants has been obtained. Fi-
nally we present the development status of the PHARAO cold atom space
clock which is under industrial realization. PHARAO will ﬂy onboard the
international Space station in the frame of the European ACES mission in
2008-2009 and perform fundamental physics tests such as an improved mea-
surement of Einstein’s red-shift, search for drift of fundamental constants
and special relativity tests.

3 Recent advances in cesium and rubidium

fountains

In this section we brieﬂy review recent advances on cesium and rubidium
fountains performed in our laboratory, BNM-SYRTE where three laser cooled
atomic fountains are in operation. The ﬁrst one (FO1), in operation since
1994 [5], has been refurbished recently. The second one (FOM), a trans-
portable fountain, is derived from the PHARAO space clock prototype [9].
This fountain was transported on two occasions to the Max Planck Insti-
2s
tute in Garching for direct frequency measurement of the hydrogen 1s
transition [47](See section on stability of fundamental constants). The third
one (FO2), a dual fountain operating with 133Cs or 87Rb, is described in [7].
Here we only brieﬂy describe the present design and recent improvements of
FO1 and FO2. A scheme of the fountain apparatus is shown in Fig.1. An
optical bench provides through optical ﬁbers all beams required for manipu-

lating and detecting the atoms. The fountains operate with lin
lin optical
molasses. Atoms are cooled by six laser beams supplied by preadjusted ﬁber
couplers precisely ﬁxed to the vacuum tank and aligned along the axes of
a 3 dimensional coordinate system, where the (111) direction is vertical. In
FOM, optical molasses is loaded from a 133Cs vapor and 3
107 atoms are
cooled in 400 ms.
In FO1 and FO2, optical molasses are loaded from a
laser slowed atomic beam which is created by diﬀusing 133Cs or 87Rb vapor
108 133Cs atoms can
through a bundle of capillary tubes. With this setup 3
be loaded in 400 ms in FO1. In FO2 an additional transverse cooling of the
atomic beam increases the loading rate to 109 atoms in 100 ms for 133Cs.

The atoms are launched upwards at 4 m.s−1 by using moving optical mo-
1 µK in the moving frame by adiabatically decreasing
lasses and cooled to
the laser intensity and increasing the laser detuning. In normal operation
atoms in the clock level
are selected by microwave and light
pulses.

Figure 2: BNM-SYRTE fountain ensemble.

About 50 cm above the capture zone, a cylindrical copper cavity (TE011
mode) is used to probe the hyperﬁne transition in a Ramsey interrogation
scheme. The cavities have a loaded quality factor of QFO1 = 10000 for FO1
and QFO2 = 6600 for FO2. Both cavities can be fed with two coupling
irises oppositely located on the cavity diameter. Symmetric or asymmetric
feedings are used to evaluate and reduce the residual Doppler eﬀect due to
imperfections of the standing wave in the cavity and a tilt of the launch
direction of the atoms.

The microwaves feeding the cavities are synthesized from the signal of an
ultra-stable cryogenic sapphire resonator oscillator (CSO) developed at the
University of Western Australia [10]. As shown in Fig.2, the three fountains
use the same CSO oscillator to synthesize the microwave signals probing
the atomic transition. To reduce its drift, the CSO is weakly phase-locked

to a hydrogen maser. This maser contributes to the local timescale and
TAI (Temps Atomique International) through various time and frequency
transfer systems. With this setup, atomic fountains are used as primary
frequency standard to calibrate TAI and can be compared to other remote
clocks. Nowadays, atomic fountains are the dominant contributors to the
accuracy of TAI.

The 11.932 GHz output signal from the CSO is converted in order to
synthesize 11.98 GHz and 100 MHz signals, both phase coherent with the
H-maser. FO2 uses the 11.98 GHz signal to generate 9.192 GHz by a home-
10−15
build low noise synthesizer which achieves a frequency stability of 3
at 1 s by operating only in the microwave domain. This scheme reduces
at the minimum the phase noise and the spurious side-bands induced by the

down conversion process. A similar setup is used to synthesize the 6.834 GHz
required for the FO2 fountain operation with 87Rb. The 150 m distance be-
tween FO1, FOM and the CSO prevents the direct use of the 11.98 GHz sig-
nal. Instead, a 100 MHz signal is synthesized from the CSO and distributed
to FO1 and FOM via a high stability RF cable. Finally, a 100 MHz to
9.192 GHz home-made synthesizer generates the interrogation signal. These
additional steps degrade the phase noise of the interrogation signal in FO1

Ramsey interrogation, the populations Ne and Ng of both clock levels
e
i
and
are measured by ﬂuorescence. The number of detected atoms is typ-
ically 0.5% of the initially captured atoms. The signal p = Ne/(Ne + Ng) is
equal to the atomic transition probability and is insensitive to atom number
ﬂuctuations. A typical Ramsey resonance is presented in Fig.3. From the
transition probability, measured on both sides of the central Ramsey fringe,
we compute an error signal to lock the microwave interrogation frequency to
the atomic transition using a digital servo loop. At the quantum limit one
expects S/N = 1/σδp = 2√N for N detected atoms, where σδp is the shot
to shot standard deviation of the ﬂuctuations of the transition probability.
The frequency corrections are applied to a computer controlled high resolu-
tion DDS synthesizer in the microwave generator. These corrections are used
for the accuracy and frequency stability evaluations of each fountain. The
107 de-
fractional frequency instability of the FO2 fountain operating with
tected atoms and measured against the cryogenic oscillator is plotted Fig.6.
At the quantum limit one expects a frequency instability, characterized by

quency standards with frequency instabilities in the low 10−14τ −1/2 region.

Cold collisions and cavity pulling

∼

The cold collision frequency shift is known to be particularly large for 133Cs
[12, 13]. For instance, when FO2 is operated at its best frequency stability
10−13. The linear extrapolation of this eﬀect to zero density is
the shift is
known to be delicate. As pointed out in the ﬁrst paper observing the cold
collision shift in 133Cs fountains [12], selecting atoms in the clock levels using
microwaves may lead to distortions of the position or velocity distribution.
Methods to cope with these eﬀects have been proposed [8], yet the linear
extrapolations have proved to be valid only at the 5% to 10% level.

F = 3, mF = 0

To evaluate the collision shift at the 10−3 level (a requirement for a fre-
quency stability and accuracy at 10−16), we recently developed a new method
F = 3, mF = 0
based on interrupted adiabatic passage to select atoms in the
i
F =
state [14]. Atomic samples are prepared by transferring atoms from
4, mF = 0
with an eﬃciency precisely equal to 100%
(high density, HD) or 50% (low density, LD). With this method, the atom
number is changed without aﬀecting either the velocity or the position dis-
tributions. Therefore, the density ratio LD/HD is equal to the atom number
ratio and is 1/2 at the 10−3 level. Since the collisional shift is proportional to
the atomic density, it can be extrapolated to zero density with this accuracy.
In addition, with this method, the cavity frequency pulling [7, 8, 15] is also
accounted for.

The collisional shift is measured in real-time with the following diﬀerential

In [14], our calculations predicted that the interrupted adiabatic passage
method does provide a LD/HD ratio precisely equal to 1/2 to better than
10−3. Initially, we were experimentally able to realize this ratio at the 1%

During routine operation of the fountains, the number of detected atoms
in each hyperﬁne state is recorded for both LD and HD conﬁgurations. As

Eﬀect of microwave spectral purity and leakage

Spectral impurities of the interrogation signal and microwave leakage may
cause shifts of the clock frequency.
In order to evaluate these eﬀects, we
make use of their dependance with the microwave power. We alternate the
Ramsey interrogation between a conﬁguration of π/2 and 3π/2 pulses, i.e.
a variation of a factor of 9 in microwave power. Within the resolution of
the measurement of 3.3
In this
measurement, four data sets are recorded, LD and HD at π/2 and LD and
HD at 3π/2. In this way, the collisional shift (which may also change with
the microwave power) is evaluated and cancelled for both π/2 and 3π/2
conﬁgurations by the diﬀerential method described above, allowing for the
extraction of a possible inﬂuence of microwave spectral purity and leakage
alone.

Residual ﬁrst order Doppler eﬀect

A frequency shift due to the ﬁrst order Doppler eﬀect can occur if the mi-
crowave ﬁeld inside the interrogation cavity exhibits a phase gradient and
the atoms pass the cavity with a slight inclination from the cavity axis. We
determine the frequency shift due to the linear component of the phase gra-
dient in a diﬀerential measurement by coupling the microwave interrogation

quence, only the quadratic phase dependence of the microwave ﬁeld remains
as a possible source of residual Doppler shift. A worst case estimate based
on [17] gives an upper bound for the fractional frequency shift of 3 parts in
1016, which we conservatively take as the overall uncertainty associated with
residual ﬁrst order Doppler eﬀect.

Other contributions to the accuracy budget are listed in Table 1. The
total accuracy currently reaches 7.5 parts in 1016 for FO1, 6.5 parts in 1016
for FO2, and 8.0 parts in 1016 for FOM. This represents a one order of
magnitude improvement over uncooled cesium devices.
In the future, we
anticipate that the extensive use of the methods described above will enable
us to bring the accuracy of 133Cs fountains below 2 parts in 1016 and the
accuracy of 87Rb to a even lower value thanks to its 100-fold lower collision
shift [7, 8].

Frequency comparisons between two 133Cs fountains at 2 10−16

The routine operation of two atomic fountains near the quantum noise limit
using the CSO as an interrogation oscillator enables frequency comparisons
in the low 10−16 range, for the ﬁrst time for primary frequency standards.
Figure 6 presents the frequency stability between FO1, FO2 and CSO. Each
fountain is operated in diﬀerential mode in order to permanently evaluate
and cancel the collision shift. Appropriate post-processing of the data thus
enables us to construct for each fountain, a clock which is free of the cold
collision shift and whose stability is shown in Fig. 6 against the CSO oscilla-
tor. Fig. 6 also shows that the combined stability between these two clocks

4 Einstein Equivalence Principle and Stabil-

ity of fundamental constants

Highly accurate atomic clocks oﬀer the possibility to perform laboratory
tests of possible variations of fundamental constants. Such tests interestingly

15

complement experimental tests of the Local Lorentz Invariance and of the
Universality of free-fall to experimentally establish the validity of Einstein’s
Equivalence Principle (EEP). They also complement tests of the variability
of fundamental constants on diﬀerent timescales, geological timescale [20, 21]
and cosmological timescale [22, 23]. Nearly all uniﬁcation theories (in par-
ticular string theories) violate EEP at some level [24, 25, 26] which strongly
motivates experimental searches for such violations.

Tests described here are based on highly accurate comparisons of atomic
energies. In principle, it is possible to express any atomic energy as a function
of the elementary particle properties and the coupling constants of funda-
mental interactions using Quantum Electro-Dynamics (QED) and Quantum
Chromo-Dynamics (QCD). As a consequence, it is possible to deduce a con-
straint to the variation of fundamental constants from a measurement of the
stability of the ratio between various atomic frequencies.

Diﬀerent types of atomic transitions are linked to diﬀerent fundamental
constants. The hyperﬁne frequency in a given electronic state of alkali-like
atoms (involved for instance in 133Cs, 87Rb [27], 199Hg+ [28, 29], 171Yb+
microwave clocks) can be approximated by:

where the superscript (i) indicates that the quantity depends on each partic-

constant. In this equation, the dimension is given by R∞c, the atomic unit

of frequency.
hfs is a numerical factor which depends on each particular
atom. F (i)
hfs(α) is a relativistic correction factor to the motion of the valence
electron in the vicinity of the nucleus. This factor strongly depends on the
atomic number Z and has a major contribution for heavy nuclei. Similarly,
the frequency of an electronic transition (involved in H [30], 40Ca [31], 199Hg+
[32], 171Yb+ [33, 34] optical clocks) can be approximated by

1It should be noted that in general the energy of an electronic transition has in fact a
contribution from the hyperﬁne interaction. However, this contribution is a small fraction
of the total transition energy and thus carries no signiﬁcant sensitivity to a variation of

16

According to [35, 36], the sensitivity to g-factors g(i) and to the proton
mass mp can be related to a sensitivity to fundamental parameters, namely
the mass scale of QCD ΛQCD and the quark masses mq = (mu + md)/2 and
ms. Therefore, any measurement of the ratio between atomic frequencies can
be interpreted as testing the stability of 4 dimensionless fundamental con-
stants: α, mq/ΛQCD, ms/ΛQCD and me/ΛQCD. The sensitivity to ms/ΛQCD
is relatively weak compared to the 3 other constants. The sensitivity coeﬃ-
cients have now been calculated for a large number of atomic species used in
atomic clocks [28, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 36, 42]. Reliable knowledge of these
sensitivity coeﬃcient at the 1% to 10% level is required to deduce limits to
a possible variation of each of these fundamental parameters by combining
the results of several complementary clock comparisons.

As pointed out in [25, 45, 46], the hypothetical uniﬁcation of all interactions

curacies of few parts in 1016 and repeated comparisons over several years

magnitude.

The transportable fountain FOM has similarly been used as a primary
standard in the measurement of the frequency νH of the hydrogen 1S-2S
transition performed at Max-Planck Institut in Garching (Germany) [30, 47].

teraction (α) and of the strong interaction (gRb/gCs, gCs(me/mp)) separately

5 The PHARAO cold atom space clock and

ACES

PHARAO, as “Projet d’Horloge Atomique par Refroidissement d’Atomes en
Orbite”, has started in 1993 with the objective of performing fundamental
metrology with a space cold atom clock [50]. The combination of laser cooling
techniques [51] and microgravity environment indeed allows the development
of space clocks with unprecedented performances.

To demonstrate the feasibility of a compact cold atom clock operating
in microgravity, BNM-SYRTE and LKB with the support of CNES (the
French space agency) have undertaken the construction of a clock prototype
in 1994. The prototype was successfully tested in 1997 in jet plane parabolic
ﬂights [9]. The same year, ESA, the European Space Agency, selected the
ACES proposal (Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space) [52]. ACES will perform
fundamental physics tests by using the PHARAO cold atom clock, a H-maser
(developed by the Neuchˆatel Observatory) and a time and frequency transfer
system MWL on a platform developed by ESA. This ensemble will ﬂy on
board the international space station in 2008-2009. The station is orbiting
at a mean elevation of 400 km with a 90 mn period and an inclination angle
of 51.6o. The planned mission duration is 18 months. During the ﬁrst 6
months, the performances of the PHARAO cold atom clock in space will be
established. Thanks to the microgravity environment the linewidth of the
atomic resonance will be varied by two orders of magnitude (from 11 Hz
10−14τ −1/2 for the frequency
to 110 mHz). The target performance is 7
×
stability and 10−16 for the frequency accuracy.
In the second part of the
mission, the onboard clocks will be compared to a number of ground based
clocks operating both in the microwave and the optical domain.

In 2001, PHARAO entered into industrial development under the man-
agement of CNES with the construction of two clock models, an engineering
model for test and validation, and a ﬂight model.

Figure 8: The PHARAO sub-systems and interfaces.

The PHARAO instrument

The clock is composed of four main sub-systems as shown in ﬁgure 8. Each
sub-system has been subcontracted to diﬀerent manufacturers and they will
be assembled at CNES Toulouse to validate the clock operation.

The laser source provides all the laser tools for cooling, launching and
detection of the atoms. Two extended cavity diode lasers [53] are used as
master lasers. One of them injection-locks two slave diode lasers to provide
108 in optical molasses. The second laser is
high laser power for capturing
used as a repumping laser. The two master laser frequencies are stabilized by
servo-loops using absorption signals through cesium cells. The other laser fre-
quencies are synthesized by using 6 acousto-optic modulators (AOM). These
AOM also control the laser beam amplitudes. The output laser beams are
connected to the cesium tube through polarization maintaining optical ﬁbers.
Figure 9 shows the PHARAO optical bench during the assembly. The total
mass is 20 kg, the volume is 26 liters and the power consumption is 40 W.

The cesium tube provides the atomic source, the controlled environment
for the atomic manipulation, the interrogation and detection process (ﬁgure
9). Its design is similar to atomic fountains except for the interrogation zone
where a two zone Ramsey cavity is used. The Ramsey cavity (ﬁgure 11) has
been specially developed for this application and forms a ring resonator. One
coupling system feeds two symmetrical lateral waveguides which meet at the

weak phase disturbances of the internal microwave ﬁeld while enabling large
9 mm) for the atom path. The ﬂight model of the microwave cavity
holes (8
is currently mounted (September 2004) inside the atomic fountain FO1 to
measure the end to end cavity phase shift before integration in the ﬂight
model. These measurements and numerical simulations, should enable us to
determine the cavity phase shift eﬀect with an accuracy of a few parts in
1017.

The cesium tube is designed for a vacuum of 10−8 Pa in order to minimize
the cold atom losses with the background gas collisions. Three layers of
magnetic shields and a servo system maintain the magnetic ﬁeld instability in
the interaction zone below 20 pT. Similarly, the interaction zone temperature
is regulated to better than 0.2oC.

The microwave chain synthesizes the two radiofrequency signals for the
state selection cavity and the interrogation cavity. A 100 MHz VCXO (Volt-
age Control Oscillator) is phase-locked to an Ultra Stable Oscillator (USO)
for the short term stability and to the Space Hydrogen Maser (SHM) for the
medium term. Three USOs have been space qualiﬁed for our application.
We have compared these quartz oscillators to the BNM-SYRTE CSO. Their

frequency stability is on the order of 7
time. The engineering model of the chain has been fully tested and the re-
sults are in agreement with the performance objectives of the space clock.
A further performance veriﬁcation is currently being made by using the mi-
crowave source in the FO2 fountain. All PHARAO sub-systems are driven
and controlled by a computer (UGB, On Board Data Processing Unit). The
UGB also manages the data ﬂux between the clock and the ACES payload.
When assembled, the clock ﬁlls a volume of about 200 l for a weight of 91 kg
and an electric consumption of 114 W.

The ﬁnal assembly of the engineering model of the PHARAO clock will
start at the end of 2005 at CNES-Toulouse. After the clock functional and
performance test are made, the ﬂight model will be assembled and ﬁnally
tested. For both models, we expect to reach 10−15 frequency accuracy in the
Earth gravity environment and 10−16 in microgravity environment.

Scientiﬁc objectives of the ACES mission

The objectives of PHARAO/ACES are (i) to explore and demonstrate the
high performances of the cold atom space clock (ii) to achieve time and
frequency transfer with stability better than 10−16 and (iii) to perform fun-
damental physics tests. A detailed account can be found in [54].

quency reference having a long term stability and accuracy provided by
PHARAO and a short term stability determined by SHM. The resulting
ﬂuctuations of ACES frequency reference are expected to be about 10 ps
per day. The orbit of ISS will allow ground users to compare and syn-
chronize their own clock to ACES clocks, leading to a worldwide access to
the ultra stable frequency reference of ACES. The results of these compar-
isons at 10−16 level will provide new tests in fundamental physics such as
an improved measurement of Einstein’s gravitational red-shift, a search for a
possible anisotropy of the speed of light and a search for possible space-time
variations of fundamental physical constants, similar to that described above
in section 4. The current most precise measurement of the red-shift was
made by the space mission Gravitational Probe A (GPA) with an accuracy
10−5 [55]. PHARAO/ACES will improve this test by a factor 30. By
of 7
allowing worldwide comparison between distant clocks, operating with dif-
ferent atomic species, ACES will play a major role in establishing new limits
for variations of fundamental constants.

×

Finally, PHARAO/ACES will be a pioneering cold atom experiment in

23

space. The PHARAO technology can be extended for the development of a
new generation of high performance inertial sensors and clocks using mat-
ter wave interferometry. As for atomic clocks, such sensors may achieve
extremely high sensitivity in micro-gravity environment, as pointed out in
the ESA HYPER project [56]. These instruments could then be used for a
large variety of scientiﬁc space missions such as VLBI, gravitational wave
detection, and deep space navigation.

6 Conclusions

10−14τ −1/2 i.e. 3

With methods described in this paper, we expect to bring the accuracy of
133Cs fountains at 1 or 2 parts in 1016. For 87Rb, a frequency stability of
10−17 at one day seems accessible, together with
1
an excellent accuracy. Routine operation of these devices over several years
will have a profound impact on ultra-precise time keeping and fundamental
physics tests. To take full beneﬁt of this performance, long distance time
transfer systems must be upgraded. In particular, the ACES time and fre-
quency transfer system will enable comparisons at the level of 10−16 per day
in 2008-2009. Another route currently under study makes use of telecom
10−14 at 1 s and
optical ﬁbers and over 100 km distance a stability of 1
10−17 at one 1 day has already been demonstrated [57]. Extension to
2
larger distances is under study.

More generally, clocks operating in the optical domain rather than in
the microwave domain are making rapid progress on the ground [58]. The
frequency of these clocks is four to ﬁve orders of magnitude higher than the
frequency of microwave standards and with an equivalent linewidth, the qual-
ity factor of the resonance exceeds that of cesium clocks by the same factor.
Using laser cooled atoms or ions and ultra-stable laser sources [59], these
optical clocks will likely open the 10−17
10−18 stability range. Using the
wide frequency comb generated by femtosecond lasers, it is now possible to
connect virtually all frequency standards together throughout the microwave
to ultra-violet frequency domain [48, 60]. The attractive proposal of [61, 62]
to realize an optical lattice clock is currently receiving a great deal of inter-
est. In this method, neutral atoms are conﬁned in an optical lattice in the
Lamb-Dicke regime. Light-shifts of the clock levels induced by the lattice
beams are diﬀerentially compensated at an appropriate laser detuning. This
proposal combines several interesting features such as long observation time,
large number of atoms, and recoil-free resonance [63]. Promising atoms to
implement this method are alkaline-earth atoms because of their strongly
forbidden inter-combination line. Ca [48, 64], Sr [63, 65] and Yb [66, 67, 68]

are actively studied.

In the frequency stability range of 10−17

10−18, it is clear that ﬂuc-
tuations of the Earth potential at the clock location induced, for instance,
by sea tides will aﬀect comparisons between distant clocks. This limitation
could be turned into an advantage if one installs such ultra-stable clock in
space where the gravitational potential can present far reduced ﬂuctuations
compared to ground. As in the past, clocks with very high stability will have
an ever increasing impact on scientiﬁc and industrial applications.

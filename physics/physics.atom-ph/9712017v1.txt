Abstract

Rotational spectra of diatomic molecules measured in the high-precision

experiments are analyzed. Such a spectrum is usually ﬁtted by an 8th

order polynomial in spin. In fact, from the theoretical point of view, the

rotational spectrum is expected to be a smooth function of spin. Thus,

ﬁtting the rotational spectrum in terms of a low order polynomial in spin

seems to be justiﬁed. However, this is not what we found in the present

work. We show that the measured spectrum is not necessarily a smooth

function of the spin, which is quite surprising. Whether or not it indicates

the presence of some hidden physics is an open question.

I. INTRODUCTION

Characteristic quantities of a diatomic molecule are the energy associated with the

motion of electrons and the one associated with the motion of two nuclei (ionic cores).

The latter motion is essentially that of a dumbbell shaped system (vibration against one

another and rotation as a whole). The order of magnitude of the electronic vs. vibrational

excitation energy (Eele/Evib) is typically 100 and that of the vibrational vs. rotational

one (Evib/Erot) another 100. It means that Eviv (Erot) corresponds to transitions in the

near (far) infrared. Thus, the electronic motion is very fast compared with that of nuclei,

so that its wavefunction may be constructed from the instantaneous constellation of two

nuclei assuming as if nuclei were frozen and thus depends parametrically on the positions

of two nuclei (Born-Oppenheimer approximation). This is the standard way of decoupling

the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom from one another. The treatment of the

nuclear part then becomes very simple.

The nuclear radial Schr¨odinger equation (with ¯h = 1) takes the form

where r is the distance between two nuclei and M the reduced mass. The potential U(r)

between two nuclei is a complicated object that involves an integration over the electronic

wavefunction, which we do not go into here. In practice, it is phenomenologically replaced

by a Morse potential. The quantum number I is the rotational spin which characterizes

the angular wavefunction YIM (θ, φ) and V the so-called vibrational quantum number

which characterizes the radial wavefunction. We note that, because of the mathematical

property of this equation, the eigenvalue EV (I) has to be an analytic function of the

parameter (spin) I. Since the eﬀective potential

V (r) = U(r) +

I(I + 1)
2Mr2

(2)

has a prominent minimum at r = r0, where r0 is of the order of the molecular size, one

usually expands it around r = r0 (

= 0) and expresses V (r) in a power series of

dV (r)
dr

r − r0. Consequently, the radial motion can be treated as a vibration having a perturbing

unharmonicity. The dependence of EV (I) on I becomes then a power series of I(I + 1)

and one usually stops the series at the 8th order in I:

EV (I) = TV + BV I(I + 1) − DV [I(I + 1)]2 + HV [I(I + 1)]3 + LV [I(I + 1)]4

(3)

In recent years, very accurate data of rotational spectra in diatomic molecular bands

became available thanks to modern experimental techniques [1–8]. What is measured in

such an experiment is the so-called R- and P-process [9]

R(I) = EH(I + 1) − EL(I), P (I) = EH (I − 1) − EL(I).

(4)

These quantities are the ‘inter-band’ ∆I = 1 (dipole) transition energies between a higher

(V = H) and a lower (V = L) vibrational band and are usually measured in the unit

of wave number (cm−1). The coeﬃcients in the formula (3) have been ﬁtted to such

experimental data [1–8]. However, one can take a diﬀerent approach [10].

By inverting the relation (4), one obtains the ‘intra-band’ ∆I = 2 (quadrupole) tran-

sition energy ∆EV (I) ≡ EV (I) − EV (I − 2) as

∆EH (I) = R(I − 1) − P (I − 1), ∆EL(I) = R(I − 2) − P (I)

(5)

for the higher and lower band, respectively. It should be remarked that, from the set of

data of R- and P-process, one obtains four separate sets of data ∆EV (I) for V = H and

V = L bands with even as well as odd spin sequences. The intra-band transition energy

should be a smooth function of spin I according to the theoretical consideration made

in the beginning. In the present work, we want to examine this statement. We will in

fact show that the measured intra-band transition energies are not necessarily smooth

functions of spin. Let us ﬁrst devise a tool which suits the analysis of data.

II. THE METHOD OF ANALYSIS

To study the behavior of ∆I = 2 transition energy ∆E(I) = E(I) − E(I − 2) for

each band (V = H or L) and each spin sequence (I =even or odd), some kind of data

3

manipulation is necessary. In fact, if one plots the quantity ∆E(I) directly, it is hardly

possible to see any ﬁne structure since ∆E(I) is a globally increasing function of I and

extends over a wide range of values. Thus, the basic idea is to look at the deviation of

the transition energy ∆E(I) from its smoothly increasing part.

To this purpose, we subtract a polynomial of order N in I from ∆E(I) and deﬁne what

we call the Nth order one-point formula [11]

with respect to qm ( ∂χ

∂qm = 0). This leads to a set of N + 1 equations (m = 0, 1, · · · , N)

Smnqn = Tm, Smn ≡

I mI n, Tm ≡

I m∆E(I).

We note that the smooth part QN (I) which we subtract from ∆E(I) is nothing other

than a polynomial of order N determined by the χ-square ﬁt to ∆E(I). However, in

practice, this formula cannot be used in the present form particularly when the order of

the polynomial N is larger than 3 since the equation (8) is highly ill-conditioned. Thus,

in what follows, we want to transform it into another form.

First, let us note that the replacement I → I −I0 does not change the ﬁtting procedure

since the shape of the polynomial QN (I) as a function of I is unchanged. Thus, the origin

of the spin values can be shifted freely. Secondly, the spin variable can be scaled too

(I → aI) since the order of the polynomial remains the same. These properties can be

used to rewrite the polynomial in a diﬀerent form.

I = ax + b. The increment of x is thus ∆x = ∆I

Shifting and scaling the spin values can be achieved most generally by a linear mapping
a (∆I = 2). We will choose a = Imax−Imin
so that the range of x becomes [-1,+1], where x = −1 (+1) corresponds

and b = Imax+Imin

2

2

to I = Imin (Imax). The polynomial in question may thus be written in the form

QN (I) =

pmPm(x).

(9)

N

m=0
X

Here, we use the Legendre polynomial Pm(x) instead of xm. The reason will be explained

below. The resulting set of equations is similar to (8) but qn is replaced by pn and I n (I m)

by Pn(x) (Pm(x)). This representation has an advantage that there holds the relation

Smn =

Pm(x)Pn(x) = 0 if m + n = odd.

(10)

+1

x=−1
X

It means that the whole set of equations splits into two independent sets of equations of

smaller dimensions, one with m, n =even and the other with m, n =odd:

N

Xn=even or odd

Smnpn = Tm, Smn ≡

Pm(x)Pn(x), Tm ≡

Pm(x)∆E(I).

(11)

+1

x=−1
X

+1

x=−1
X

This set of equations determines the coeﬃcients pm and accordingly the polynomial (9)

which represents the smooth part of ∆E(I).

It remains to be remarked that the original set of equations (8) is highly ill-conditioned.

It is indeed so ill-conditioned that even the double precision algorithm is not free from

the numerical instability caused by large losses of accuracy if N is greater than 3. This

problem can be avoided by shifting and scaling the spin values as presented above. In

fact, the situation improves slightly if one uses the power series xm thanks to a property

analogous to (10). Nevertheless, this does not fully resolve the numerical instability. The

reason lies basically in the fact that the zeros of xm are multiple and are all concentrated

at x = 0. In contrast, all zeros of Pm(x) are simple and never coincide with one another

for diﬀerent m’s. The use of the Legendre polynomial Pm(x) instead of the power series

xm is thus essential for the numerical reliability (both accuracy and stability). A similar

caution may be necessary when ﬁtting the formula (3) to experimental data.

In the next section, we will present ∆(1)

N E(I) for a number of experimental data using

a 7th order polynomial. In fact, N = 7 is quite appropriate for the analysis of molecular

rotational spectra since the rotational spectrum for a given vibrational band is ﬁtted

(globally) by a formula containing up to the 8th order in spin I (see eq.(3)) so that the

transition energy ∆E(I) is a 7th order polynomial.

We will also deﬁne the ‘ﬁltered’ one-point formula by setting the quantity ∆(1)

N E(I) to

zero if its absolute value is smaller than or equal to the corresponding error bar. This

5

formula is quite useful in practice. By construction, it shows whether the deviation of the

transition energy ∆E(I) from its smooth part is physically signiﬁcant or not.

III. ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA

As mentioned before, we obtain four sets of transition energies ∆E(I) (even and odd

spin sequence for higher and lower band) from the measurement of R(I) and P (I). Thus,

four independent sets of data ∆(1)

N E(I) can be created, which we present as diagrams.

As an example, we plot in Fig.1a the 7th order one-point formula ∆(1)

7 E(I) obtained

from the measured R(I) and P (I) of the 2-2 band of the A1Σ+ − X 1Σ+ system of the

molecule YN [4]. On the other hand, Fig.1b shows the corresponding ﬁltered one-point

formula. It is ‘ﬁltered’ in the sense that we take

∆(1)

N E(I) = 0 if

|∆(1)

N E(I)| ≤ Error Bar

(12)

where Error Bar is twice the error bar of the measurement of R(I) and P (I), see eq.(5).

Eq.(12) makes easily visible that some deviations of the transition energy from the smooth

part that occur in Fig.1a are physically insigniﬁcant as they are zero within the Error Bar.

Thus, if the rotational spectrum is indeed a smooth function of spin I, which is what

we want to conﬁrm, the deviation should be zero everywhere when ﬁltered. However,

Fig.1b clearly shows that there remain some deviations which are not ﬁltered away to zero

(V = H band). These deviations are beyond the Error Bar and may thus be considered

as signiﬁcant. This is rather surprising but is not a single case. We found many such

cases, most of them being more complicated than this example. It should be emphasized

that the ﬁltered formula clearly shows at which spins the anomaly occurs.

We present another example. Figs.2a and 2b show respectively the one-point formula

and the corresponding ﬁltered formula applied to the 1-1 band of the C 1Σ+ − X 1Σ+

system of the molecule YD [5]. One sees a behavior similar to the above example, though

it looks slightly complex. As a matter of fact, this kind of results is seen also in the 0-0

and 1-0 bands of the A6Σ+ − X 6Σ+ system of the CrD molecule [6]. Actually, there are

6

many more complex cases in the data we have analyzed, some of which will be shown

later. Thus, it seems that there exists anomaly (irregularity) in the measured spectrum

and the question is where it comes from.

We have examined the relation between a spectrum and the resulting irregularity which

appears in the transition energy. Suppose that there is a band crossing in a spectrum. It

will produce a kink at the crossing point and thus an irregularity in the transition energy.

While it is unlikely that a band crossing may occur in the molecular cases, it indeed exists

in the nuclear cases [11], which leads to the so-called backbending phenomenon. Based

on this observation, we have studied a model in which a smooth rotational spectrum

E(I) = AI(I + 1) has a sequence of kinks around a spin I = I0. Since the smooth

part of the transition energy ∆E(I) = E(I) − E(I − 2) = 2A(2I − 1) is a ﬁrst order

polynomial in I, it will be suﬃcient to use the 1st order one-point formula ∆(1)

1 E(I) in

such a demonstrative example. Some of them are presented in Fig.3.

The three-kink model in Fig.3 is of particular interest to the YN molecule [4] as it

reproduces the V = H even spin data shown in Fig.1b while the V = H odd spin data

corresponds to a special four-kink model. The three-kink spectrum in Fig.3 was produced

by shifting ‘down’ the energy from a smooth curve E(I) = AI(I +1) at a spin I = I0 while

the pattern with exactly opposite phase will be obtained by shifting ‘up’ the energy. In

general, a spectrum with a given number of kinks can produce several diﬀerent patterns

depending on the way how the kinks are created.

Let us next examine the YD molecule [5] presented in Fig.2b. The V = H even

spin data can also be understood in terms of a three-kink model, in which three-fold

kinks occur at two diﬀerent places (at I = 18 and 32 in a spectrum of the form E(I) =

AI(I + 1) − B[I(I + 1)]2). Fig.4 compares the data and such a ‘theory’. The experiment

is reproduced quite well. On the other hand, the V = H odd spin data seems to suggest

the presence of diﬀerent types of kinks that occur at three diﬀerent places. In fact, the

ﬁrst one (at the lowest spin region) shows obviously a two-kink pattern while the last one

(at the highest spin region) a four-kink pattern, cf. Fig.3. Finally, the middle one is more

complicated but one can easily guess that it is a six-kink pattern.

7

Therefore, whatever the reason may be, it is certain that there exist various types of

kinks that occur locally at diﬀerent places in these rotational spectra. In other words,

they are for sure not smooth (or analytic) functions of the spin.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have shown that the molecular rotational spectrum is not necessarily a smooth

function of spin according to the measurements of R(I) and P (I) as well as the error

estimate of the measurements. This is quite surprising because of our theoretical under-

standing that the spectrum has to be an analytic function of spin I, which follows from

the equation (1) obtained by assuming the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Since it is

rather diﬃcult to believe that this approximation is violated, the ﬁrst thought occurred

to us was that there should be some error in the input ﬁle to our Fortran code because

even a single error in typing data would create ‘artiﬁcial’ kinks. It may also be worth

reconﬁrming all data at diﬀerent laboratories with diﬀerent experimental setups.

In the previous section, we have shown relatively simple examples but there are actually

many more complex cases. Fig.5 shows the ﬁltered one-point formula applied to the 0-0

band belonging to the B1Σ+

u − X 1Σ+

g system of the 63Cu2 molecule [2]. Nevertheless,

it is likely that this result can also be decomposed and classiﬁed into various patterns

as we have done in the previous section. We believe that this way of understanding the

experimental data is suggestive and that intensive (phenomenological) studies along this

line will give a useful clue. The aim of the present work is to initiate such a study1. One

day, we may then be able to ﬁnd the real physical implication lying behind this ‘new’

phenomenon, although whether or not it contains something new is an open question.

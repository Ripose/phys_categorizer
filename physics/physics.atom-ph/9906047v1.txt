Positron binding to anions is investigated within the work formalism proposed by Harbola and
Sahni (HS) for the halide anions and the systems Li− through O− excluding Be− and N −. The

total ground state energies of the anion-positron bound systems are empirically found to be an upper

bound to the Hartree-Fock(HF) energies. The computed expectation values as well as positron

and positronium aﬃnities are in good agreement with their restricted Hartree-Fock counterparts.

Binding of a positron to neutral atomic species is also investigated using an iterative method.

I. INTRODUCTION

Despite extensive studies [1-11] the problem of a positron forming a transient bound state with a neutral atom

has not yet been decisively settled.

It is known that a negatively charged ion always binds a positron; in fact it

turns out that there is an inﬁnite number of bound states. The classical Coulomb interaction between an anion

and a positron is suﬃcient to bind a positron while in case of neutral atoms the polarization of electron charge

distribution is found to be vital for binding [12]. Schrader et al. [13,14] have calculated the positronium aﬃnities for

halogen atoms using a diﬀusion quantum Monte Carlo technique in which the core region is represented by a model

potential. Accurate calculations on the positronium hydride, positronium helium and positronium lithium systems

using the all particle diﬀusion Monte Carlo method have been recently reported by Yoshida et al. [8,9]. Very recently,
Bressanini [15] et al. have investigated the positron-anion bound states for the anionic species Li−, B−, C−, O− and
F − using variational and diﬀusion quantum Monte Carlo techniques. They found that except B− all these systems are

stable against dissociation into the corresponding neutral atom and positronium. Such methods are computationally

very demanding thereby restricting their applicability to systems with fewer particles. The independent particle

approximation methods such as the Hartree-Fock or density functional theories enable one to compute with ease the

anionic-positron interactions for all the anions in the periodic table. Calculations within the restricted HF theory
have been reported by Cade and Farazdel [16,17] and Patrick and Cade [12] for the systems Li− through O− as well

as for halogen anions. They have also examined the stability of anion-positron bound systems with respect to their

dissociation into the corresponding atom and positronium. For the description of many electron-positron bound system

within the density functional theory (DFT), Chakraborty [18] has proposed a two component density functional theory

wherein the electron and the positron densities play the role of basic variables. This was subsequently extended by

Harrison [19] to incorporate self-interaction correction [20] wherein the calculated positron and positronium aﬃnities

are in close agreement with their HF counterparts. By invoking the Slater transition state concept Baruah et al. [21]

have obtained decent estimates of positron aﬃnities to negative ions. Earlier, density functional calculations of the

positron-anion bound state had also been carried out by Kanhere et al. [22].

Recently, an attractive alternative to the Hartree-Fock theory was proposed by Harbola and Sahni [23]. The

exchange-correlation potential in the so-termed work formalism of Harbola-Sahni (HS) is obtained as the work done

in bringing an electron in the electric ﬁeld of its Fermi-Coulomb hole charge distribution. The work formalism HF

approximation essentially emerges if one ignores Coulomb correlations and the correlation contribution to the kinetic

energy in the Kohn-Sham theory [24]. Recently, Holas and March [25] have shown that the HS potential can be

obtained from the full second order density matrix. The total atomic energies and various one electron properties

of work formalism are practically equivalent to those of HF theory [26]. Unlike other local exchange-only density

functionals, the work formalism of HS selectively gives convergent orbitals and eigenvalues for negative ions that are

comparable to the HF accuracy [30]. In the present communication, we address the problem of positron binding to

anions and atoms within the exchange-only work formalism. The purpose of the present work is two-fold: 1) To

compute the positron aﬃnities and binding energies using local orbital-independent density functional theory. 2) To

test the work formalism of the Harbola-Sahni for the description of many electron-positron system. The computed
positron aﬃnities, binding energies and < rn > − moments (n = −1 through 2) within the work formalism are

compared against their restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) counterparts. For the neutral atom-positron bound states we

use an iterative method similar to the one used by Patrick and Cade [12]. The plan on the presentation is as follows:

In section II we outline the theory of work formalism for the description of electron-positron system while section III

deals with the results and discussion which will be followed by conclusions in section IV.

central ﬁeld approximation in which the present calculations have been carried out (see references [24], [26]for details).

It is to be the noted that HS exchange potential obtained this way diﬀer from the exact Kohn-Sham potential only

by the kinetic correlation contribution [27,24]. The orbitals, φi, in Eq. (5) are the solutions of the (Kohn-Sham like)

The Herman-Skillman code [29], modiﬁed for the Harbola-Sahni potential has been further modiﬁed in order to
incorporate the positron. The calculations are carried out in the central-ﬁeld approximation for the systems Li−
through F − except for Be− and N − and the halide ions. In order to obtain the ground state of an anion A−, we start

with converged potential of the neutral atom A and perform self-consistent calculation. The converged potential of
the anionic system A− was then taken as a starting potential for the anion-positron self-consistent calculation. This

was done in order to achieve fast convergence. In the following section we present our main results.

The total energies of the anion-positron bound states calculated in the present formalism and the corresponding

restricted HF (RHF) energies for the positron in diﬀerent states are displayed in Table I. The RHF numbers for total

energies, positron and positronium aﬃnities against which we compare our results are due to Patrick and Cade [12]

and Cade and Farazdel [16]. The present total energies are in good agreement with the HF energies. The diﬀerences

in parts per million between the energies of the present work and those of the HF theory are given in Table II for the

anion-positron bound state (the positron is in the 1s orbital). The diﬀerences diminish with the size of the anion.

It is also evident from the table that the calculated total energies are slightly higher than the HF energies. This is

expected since the HS orbitals diﬀer from the HF orbitals which variationally minimize the total energy.

III. RESULTS

The positron aﬃnity is deﬁned as

P.A. = E(A−) + E(e+) − E([A−; e+]),

(10)

where E([A−; e+]) denotes the energy of the anion-positron bound system. Positive value of the P.A. indicates that
E[A−; e+] is a bound state, that is, the system A− will bind a positron. The calculated positron aﬃnities and
the negative of the positron eigenvalue are given Table in III, also given are the corresponding HF values given for

comparison. For all the systems, the PA is positive indicating their stability with respect to dissociation into an

anion and a positron. The present values of the positron energy eigenvalues are in general higher in magnitude than

the corresponding HF values and lie between the PA calculated from Eq. (10) and the recent diﬀusion quantum

Monte Carlo (QMC) values [15]. The available diﬀusion Monte Carlo values [15] for the positron aﬃnities for diﬀerent
systems (in ground state) are 6.507(Li−), 6.015(B−), 5.941(C−), 5.862(O−) and 6.170(F −) in eV .

Another binding energy of importance is the positronium aﬃnity, a positive value of which means the system
[A−; e+] is stable with respect to break up into the positronium (P s) and a neutral atom A. The binding energies or
positronium aﬃnities can be computed in various ways [5]. We compute the positronium aﬃnities using the following

two deﬁnitions:

P sA = E(A) + E(P s) − E([A−; e+])

and

P sA = E.A. + P.A. + E(P s).

(11)

(12)

Positronium aﬃnities computed from Eq.(11) are compared against the restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) positronium

aﬃnities [12,16] in Table III. While for all the systems investigated the present and the RHF values of positronium

aﬃnities (calculated using Eq. (11)) are in good agreement, no system is stable with respect to dissociation into a

neutral atom and positronium: the positronium aﬃnities for all systems are negative.

In order to calculate the positronium aﬃnity using Eq. (12), we choose −ǫmax of anionic system for the electron

aﬃnity (EA) as it is empirically found [31] that in the exchange-only work formalism and the HF theory, the −ǫmax

of the anionic system is, in general, a better estimate of EA than those obtained from the diﬀerence of self-consistent

total energies of the atom and the corresponding anion. Further, it is observed that such estimates of EA within the

present formalism are closer to the experimental EA [32] than those obtained in HF theory by means of Koopmans’
theorem [30]. For positron aﬃnity we employ −ǫ+ (third column in Table III) since this quantity is, in general, in
better agreement with the accurate QMC positron aﬃnity than the one obtained by taking diﬀerence of self-consistent

energies (using Eq. (10)). The positronium aﬃnities thus calculated are also given in the last column of the Table

III. These values of P sA are less negative than the P sA computed as the diﬀerence of the self-consistent energies
(Eq.(11) leading in some cases to the binding. The systems [O−; e+
1s] and [Br−; e+
1s]
are found to be stable against the dissociation into the positronium and an atom. This binding may be attributed to

2p], [Cl−; e+

1s], [F −; e+

1s], [F −; e+

the accurate asymptotic structure of the work formalism HF approximation.

We ﬁnally present the one electron properties such as < rn > expectation values for halide anions in the Table IV.

The one electron expectation values are in good agreement with their HF counterparts. The computed < 1/r > values

are slightly larger than the HF values, implying the slight increase in the positron density towards the nucleus which

therefore, should be compensated by small reduction in the long-range of the positron density leading to smaller < r >
and < r2 >. This is indeed the case as can be seen from the Table IV.

We have also investigated the binding of positron to neutral atoms in the spirit of Patrick and Cade, by starting

with the anion-positron bound state and reducing the ionicity of the system to obtain desired neutral system. It was

found that the neutral-atom positron bound state does not exist in the exchange-only work formalism. This, however,

is not surprising as the present treatment lacks the electron-positron and electron-electron correlation eﬀects which

4

are crucial to permit such a binding [21]. Further, it has been rigorously shown by Pathak [35] that the deviation

from the spherical symmetry is a necessary condition in order that the positron binding to neutral atom would occur.

The present treatment can be extended to include the correlations eﬀects, namely the electron-electron Coulomb

correlations, correlation contribution to the kinetic energy and the electron-positron correlation. The ﬁrst one can be

incorporated by modeling the correlation second-order density matrix as suggested by Levy and Perdew [27] while

the second one can be derived in terms of density matrices via virial theorem [25]. The electron-positron correlation

potential [36] can be added in an ad hoc manner to the eﬀective potential.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In the present work, the positron binding to negative ions is investigated within the exchange-only work formalism.

The work formalism of Harbola-Sahni seems to provide the Hartree-Fock level description of the electron-positron

system as can be seen from the agreement between the present values of positron and positronium aﬃnities and

their restricted Hartree-Fock counterpart. The advantage of the work formalism is that its eﬀective potential is local,
orbital independent and therefore computationally cheaper. The systems [O−; e+
[Br−; e+

1s] are found to be stable against the dissociation into the positronium and the corresponding atom.

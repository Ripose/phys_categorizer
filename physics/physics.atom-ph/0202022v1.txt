Direct muon transfer in low-energy collisions of the muonic hydrogen Hµ and helium (He++) is
considered in a three-body quantum-mechanical framework of coordinate-space integro-diﬀerential
Faddeev-Hahn-type equations within two- and six-state close coupling approximations. The ﬁnal-
state Coulomb interaction is treated without any approximation employing appropriate Coulomb
waves in the ﬁnal state. The present results agree reasonably well with previous semiclassical
calculations.

Experimental

investigation of the low-energy muon
transfer in collision of muonic hydrogen Hµ (bound state
of a hydrogen isotope and muon µ−) and He is important
for muon catalyzed fusion cycle of hydrogen isotopes [1].
If the hydrogen is contaminated by He, then the muon-
catalyzed fusion of hydrogen isotopes will be aﬀected by
muon transfer from Hµ to He. This makes the study of
muon transfer from Hµ to He of special relevance. The
study of such collisions involving three charged particles
is also interesting from a theoretical point of view as an
example of rearrangement scattering with Coulomb in-
teraction in the ﬁnal state. Such reactions with post-
collision Coulomb interaction between clusters appear
frequently in atomic and molecular physics.

Recently, we formulated [2] a few-body quantum-
mechanical description of direct muon-transfer reaction
from Hµ to diﬀerent nuclei using the Faddeev-Hahn-type
few-body equations [3, 4] in the close-coupling approxi-
mation. We applied this formulation successfully to the
study of muon transfer among various hydrogen isotopes.
In that study there was no ﬁnal-state Coulomb interac-
tion. Later on we extended this approach to the study
of muon transfer from hydrogen isotopes to He and Li,
where the ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction is appropri-
ately included in the calculational scheme [5]. Next we
included heavier targets such as, C, O [5, 6], Ne, S, and Ar
[7], in the scheme, where appropriate polarization poten-
tials were included in addition to the ﬁnal-state Coulomb
interaction.
In case of these heavy targets the muon
transfer rates from Hµ agree well with the existing ex-
perimental results [5, 6, 7]. In case of these heavier tar-
gets there is evidence [7, 8] that the muon is absorbed in
a speciﬁc ﬁnal state of the heavy nuclei, and hence, the
muon-transfer rates were calculated in a two-state close-
coupling approximation including a single state each of
the target and the incident Hµ.

In this report, we perform a two- and six-state calcula-
tion of direct muon-transfer from Hµ to He isotopes and
compare with other calculations. The reaction we study
is

(Hµ)1s + He++ → (Heµ)+
where He++ represents the He nucleus and (Heµ)+
1s the
hydrogen-like bound state of He++ and a muon. The

1s + H+,

(0.1)

present study is meant to test the accuracy and the con-
vergence trend of our approach. For the lighter target
such as He, muon transfer could take place via direct as
well as compound molecular formation. The experimen-
tal rates include the molecular formation [9]. The method
we consider here is not applicable to muon transfer via
molecular formation. The experimental transfer rates via
molecular formation leads to much higher results in the
case of target He while compared to the theoretical re-
sult of direct muon transfer. For heavier targets, such
as C, O, Ne, Ar etc., the molecular rates are highly sup-
pressed and the muon transfer takes place essentially via
the direct channel and our theoretical direct rates are in
agreement with experiment [5, 6, 7].

For the theoretical treatment of a three-body muon-
transfer rearrangement process, Faddeev-type equations
[3], especially the modiﬁed version proposed by Hahn [4],
appear to be very suitable. The two possible asymptotic
two-cluster conﬁgurations of the above rearrangement
problem are conveniently tackled by a set of two coupled
Faddeev-Hahn-type equations for components Ψ1 and Ψ2
of the wave function Ψ = Ψ1+Ψ2, where each component
carrys the asymptotic boundary condition for a speciﬁc
conﬁguration [10]. These equations are very useful to
incorporate distortion potentials for speciﬁc initial and
ﬁnal asymptotic states [11]. It is possible to include the
ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction explicitly in these equa-
tions, so that a low-order approximation to these equa-
tions produces the correct asymptotic behavior [11].

Here we quote the Faddeev-Hahn-type two-component
equations used in the close coupling type approximation
for the calculation of muon transfer rates [2, 6]. We de-
note He++ by 1, the hydrogen isotope(s) by 2 and muon
by 3. Below the three-body breakup threshold, follow-
ing two-cluster asymptotic conﬁgurations are possible in
the system 123: (23) − 1 and (13) − 2. These two
conﬁgurations correspond to two distinct physical chan-
nels, denoted by 1 and 2, respectively. These conﬁgura-
tions are determined by the Jacobi coordinates (~rj3, ~ρk):
~r13 = ~r3 − ~r1,
~ρ2 = (~r3 + m1~r1)/(1 + m1) − ~r2,
~ρ1 = (~r3 + m2~r2)/(1 + m2) − ~r1, where
~r23 = ~r3 − ~r2,
~ri, mi (i = 1, 2, 3,) are coordinates and masses of the
particle i, respectively.

Let us introduce the total three-body wave function as

a sum of two components [4]

Ψ(~r1, ~r2, ~r3) = Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) + Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2)

(0.2)

where Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1) is quadratically integrable over the
variable ~r23, and Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2) over ~r13. The components
Ψ1 and Ψ2 carry the asymptotic boundary condition for
channels 1 and 2, respectively. The second component
is responsible for pure Coulomb interaction in the ﬁnal
state. These components satisfy the following set of two
coupled equations [6]

[E − (H0 + V23(~r23))]Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1)

= [(V23(~r23) + V12(~r12)) − UC(~ρ2)]Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2)(0.3)

[E − (H0 + V13(~r13)) − UC (~ρ2)]Ψ2(~r13, ~ρ2)
= [(V13(~r13) + V12(~r12))]Ψ1(~r23, ~ρ1)

(0.4)

where E is the center-of-mass energy, H0 the total ki-
netic energy operator, Vij (~rij ) the pair potential (i 6=
j = 1, 2, 3), UC the ﬁnal-state Coulomb interaction. For
both UC = 0 and UC 6= 0, Eqs. 0.3 and 0.4 are equivalent
to the underlying Schr¨odinger equation for the problem.
Hence a converged solution of these equations should lead
to the true dynamical solution of the problem. How-
ever, an approximate (low-order) close-coupling solution
of these equations with the proper ﬁnal-state Coulomb
interaction UC should lead to a more converged solution
when compared with a similar solution with UC = 0 as
we shall see in the following. At higher energies the eﬀect
of the explicit inclusion of the Coulomb potential Uc in
the equations above is reduced and the transfer rates for
Uc = 0 tends towards those for Uc 6= 0.

We solve the integro-diﬀerential form of the Faddeev-
Hahn equation by the close-coupling approximation
scheme involving up to six states. This procedure consists
in expanding the wave function components Ψ1 and Ψ2 in
terms of eigenfunctions of subsystem Hamiltonians in ini-
tial and ﬁnal channels, respectively. Although, these sub-
system eigenfunctions are not orthogonal to each other,
the components Ψ1 and Ψ2 satisfy a coupled set of equa-
tions incorporating the correct asymptotic behavior of
the wave function. Consequently, there is no problem
of overcompleteness as encountered in similar expansion
approaches for rearrangement reactions based on the
Schr¨odinger equation. The resultant coupled Faddeev-
Hahn-type equations are then projected on the expan-
sion functions. After a partial-wave projection this leads
to a set of one-dimensional coupled integro-diﬀerential
equations for the expansion coeﬃcients, which is solved
numerically. The mathematical details of the approach
have appeared elsewhere and we refer the interested read-
ers to the original references [2, 5].

First, we restrict ourselves to a two-level approxima-
tion by choosing in the relevant close-coupling expan-
sion the hydrogen-like ground states (Hµ)1s and (Heµ)+
1s,
and 2H+, and He = 3He++ and 4He++.
where H = 1H
Numerically, stable and converged results were obtained

in these cases. The rates λtr /106 sec−1 for both UC = 0
and UC 6= 0 at low energies are presented in Table I
[13, 14, 15]. Next
together with the results of Refs.
we extend the calculation to the six-state model where
we include the Hµ(1s,2s,2p) and (Heµ)+(1s,2s,2p) states
of both muonic hydrogen and helium. These transition
rates for both UC = 0 and UC 6= 0 are also shown in
Table I. All rates have converged to the precision shown
in this table. The present results are consistent with the
phenomenological isotope eﬀect, e.g., the rate decreases
from 1H to 2H [12]. The eﬀect of including the (2s,2p)
states in the calculational scheme is also explicit.

The present six-state calculation, when compared with
the two-state calculation, shows the trend of convergence.
We see that at high energies the Uc 6= 0 rates tend to-
wards the Uc = 0 rates. This is illustrated in Table I for
the two-state model for two systems. However, the eﬀect
of the inclusion of Uc is signiﬁcant at low energies. The
two-state rates with Uc = 0 are the least converged. The
six-state rates with Uc = 0 show the direction of conver-
gence. From an analysis of our results reported in Table I,
we ﬁnd, as expected, the six-state results with Uc 6= 0 are
the most converged. The two-state rates with Uc 6= 0 are
more converged than the three-state rates with Uc = 0.
The explicit inclusion of the ﬁnal-state Coulomb inter-
action UC has enhanced the convergence and has led to
more consistent rates. The present six-state results for
UC 6= 0 are very close to the semiclassical results of Ref.
[13] for all four systems considered. However, the agree-
ment with the results of Ref.
[14] is poor; the present
rates for 1Hµ (2Hµ) are roughly double (ten times) the
[14]. Considering the very qualitative and
rates of Ref.
[15], the
semiclassical nature of the calculation of Ref.
fair agreement with the present few-body quantum treat-
ment and with Ref. [13] is encouraging.

The study of three-body charge transfer reactions with
Coulomb repulsion in the ﬁnal state has been the sub-
ject of this report. We have studied such reactions em-
ploying a detailed few-body description of the rearrange-
ment scattering problem by solving the Faddeev-Hahn-
type equations [3, 4] in coordinate space. To provide cor-
rect asymptotic form in the ﬁnal state the pure Coulomb
interaction has been incorporated directly into the equa-
tions. It is shown that within this formalism, the appli-
cation of a close-coupling-type ansatz leads to satisfac-
tory results already in low-order approximations for di-
rect muon-transfer reactions between hydrogen isotopes
and light nuclei He++. Because of computational diﬃ-
culties, in this application we have considered up to six
states in the expansion scheme (1s,2s,2p on each center
− Hµ and He+
µ ), which may not always be adequate.
Further calculations with larger basis sets are needed to
obtain accurate converged results. However, the inclu-
sion of three basis states on each center is expected to
build in a satisfactory account of the polarization poten-
tial in the model and should lead to physically acceptable
results. The agreement of the present rates with those of
the semiclassical model also assuring.

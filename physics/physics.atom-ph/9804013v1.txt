Abstract

Calculations of transition energies between low-lying states of mercury atom
are performed in the frame of combined CI/MBPT2 method. Results of
all-electron relativistic calculations (using the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian)
are compared with experimental data and results of other four-component
calculations. The results of the RECP calculations are compared with the
corresponding all-electron results in order to estimate accuracy of diﬀerent
RECPs. Contributions from correlations in diﬀerent shells to the calculated
excitation energies as well as eﬀects of basis set truncation at diﬀerent orbital
angular momenta, nuclear models, errors in gaussian approximation of the
GRECP components are reported. Analysis of the obtained results shows that
at least 34 external electrons of mercury atom should be correlated and the
one-electron basis set should contain up to h angular momentum functions in
order to reach a reliable agreement with experimental data within 200 cm−1.
It is concluded that correlations of the 4f electrons can be eﬃciently taken
into account for 20 electron GRECP at the generation stage.

I. INTRODUCTION

During the last few years, a considerable number of papers devoted to electronic struc-
ture calculations of heavy atoms have been published (e.g., see [1–3]) that is not only due
to experimental requirements but because they are good test systems to check or estimate
accuracy of diﬀerent approximations before using them in more expensive molecular calcu-
lations.

In paper [4], Generalized Relativistic Eﬀective Core Potentials (GRECPs) were tabulated
for atoms Hg through Rn and were tested in numerical Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations by
comparison with the all-electron Dirac-Fock (DF) and other RECP ones. However, the
question

of quality of the GRECPs for description of correlation eﬀects was not clariﬁed yet.
Whereas paper [5] contains an answer on this question from theoretical point of view, the
present paper is devoted to our correlation structure calculations for mercury atom. For this
atom, the RECPs were generated by other groups [6,7] where the same number of electrons
(20) was explicitly included into calculations as in the case of the GRECP [4]. Therefore,
one

should expect about the same computational expenses in calculations with
all these RECPs and the comparison of their accuracy appears to be of practical interest.

II. METHODS AND BASIS SETS

The GRECP method was described in details in papers [8,4,5]. The main distinguishing
features of this method are presence of non-local terms with the projectors on the outercore
(OC) pseudospinors together with the standard semi-local ones in the eﬀective potential
operator and generation of the eﬀective potential components for smoothed pseudospinors
which may have nodes [9].

Theory of the CI/MBPT2 method is presented in papers [2]. In this method, the corre-
lations in the valence (V) region of an atom which are the most important ones are treated
by the Conﬁguration Interaction (CI) method (which is able to provide excellent results for
the small number of correlated electrons) whereas the relatively small contributions to the
considered low excitation energies from the large number of the core-valence correlations are
taken into account with the help of less expensive second order Many Body Perturbation
Theory (MBPT2).

The program (in the jj-coupling scheme) for all-electron relativistic four-component
CI/MBPT2 calculations (using the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian) was modiﬁed to make pos-
sible two-component RECP calculations (with the nonrelativistic kinetic energy operator
and relativistic j-dependent potentials). This program allows one to use two diﬀerent basis
sets of numerical spinors at the CI and MBPT2 calculation stages for description of the
correlations taking into account a space separation of the core and valence regions. Basis
functions for the present calculations were obtained from numerical SCF (DF or HF) calcu-
lations of the corresponding spinors for positive ion states. For example, the [4,4,3,2,1] basis
set for the 2 electron valence CI (2e-CI) was derived from the calculations for the follow-
ing nonrelativistically averaged conﬁgurations of Hg: 5d106s2, [5d9]7s1, [5d6]8s1, [5d3]9s1,

basis set for the case of N correlated electrons will refer here to a basis set consisting of

. . . (5 + kh)h11/2 spinors where ns = 5 if N ≥ 20, np = 5 if N ≥ 18, nd = 5 if N ≥ 12, nf = 4
if N ≥ 34, otherwise ns = 6, np = 6, nd = 6, nf = 5. Additional information on the used
basis sets can be found on http://www.qchem.pnpi.spb.ru. The above listed basis set has
provided the lowest total energy in our CI calculations as compared with other tested

similar-sized basis sets. More important advantage of this basis set is a possibility of

one-to-one comparison between results of the all-electron

and RECP calculations not only for large (close to full) basis set sizes
but for the small ones as well. In fact, the calculated RECP errors depend only slightly

on the size of such basis sets.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Series of the correlation structure calculations were performed for the number of cor-
related electrons varied from 2 to 34 and one-electron basis sets truncated at the orbital
quantum numbers from 2 to 5. The all-electron relativistic calculations were implemented
for two nuclear models: a point nucleus and an uniformly charged ball with 1.334 · 10−4 a.u.
radius. The GRECP calculations were made with both the numerical GRECP components
and their gaussian expansions from [4]. Moreover, 34 electron GRECP variant (where the
outercore 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d and valence 6s, 6p shells of mercury atom are explicitly treated in
calculations) was generated and tested in these calculations.

The results of the 2e-CI calculations (where all the possible excitations of 2 valence
electrons were considered and the core 1s1/2–5d5/2 spinors were frozen from the SCF calcu-
lations of the ground state with the 6s2 conﬁguration) are presented in tables I and II for
[8, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4] and [4, 4, 3, 2, 1] basis sets. One can see from these tables that the use

of the [4, 4, 3, 2, 1] basis set allows one to describe adequately the V-V
correlations and that the RECP errors are rather stable in respect to the basis set size
variation. Whereas the correlations only in the valence region are considered, the 20 electron
GRECP is about 8 times more accurate than the 20 electron RECP of Ross et al. [6] and
about 30 times more accurate than the 20 electron energy-adjusted PseudoPotential (PP) [7]
(ﬁrst of all, due to the neglect of the diﬀerence between the outercore and valence potentials
in the RECPs [6,7]; see [8,5] for details).

From tables III and IV in [4] one can see that the errors of the energy-adjusted PP, Ross et

1/2 state to the 6s1

3/2(J = 2) states1 are -667 and +347 cm−1, +182 and +224 cm−1, -9 and -9 cm−1,
and 6s1
correspondingly. They are in agreement with the errors from tables I and II here with an
exception of the GRECP errors (because the main contribution to the GRECP errors is due
to errors of reproducting the two-electron integrals rather than drawbacks of the eﬀective
potential operator).

In tables II–V, results of both the all-electron relativistic and 20 electron GRECP calcu-
lations are presented for diﬀerent numbers of correlated electrons2 using the equivalent basis
sets. One can see that the 2e-CI (table II) gives only rough description of the correlation
structure of mercury atom, the errors in energies of excitations from the ground state are
3000–6000 cm−1 in respect to the experimental data or the most elaborated calculations in
table V. Such a large

deviation is mainly due to neglect of the OC-V correlations involving the 5d shell. Their
consideration (in the 12e-CI/MBPT2, table III) reduces these errors to a level of about
1000 cm−1. The contributions from the correlations with the 5p and 5s shells (the 18e-
CI/MBPT2 and 20e-CI/MBPT2, tables III and IV) to the excitation energies are 400–
600 cm−1 and about -300 cm−1, correspondingly. However, these contributions are mainly
compensated and the total contribution from the correlations with both these shells is only
100–300 cm−1. The correlations with the 4f shell (the 34e-CI/MBPT2, table V) give an
essential contribution that is 600–700 cm−1. Our ﬁnal all-electron results for transitions
between the ﬁrst four states are within 200 cm−1 with the experimental data [10] and the
Relativistic Coupled Cluster (RCC) calculation results of Eliav et al. [3]. A relatively large
deviation for the last state is rather due to the MBPT2 approximation than due to basis set
incompleteness or correlations in more inner shells. Our estimates show that the contribution
from the correlations with the 4d shell to the excitation energies is of order of 100 cm−1.

When only the V-V correlations are considered (tables I and
II), the GRECP errors in reproducting the all-electron results are within 30 cm−1. This is
a good conﬁrmation to our previous estimates [4] that the GRECP describes the electronic
structure in the valence region with a high accuracy. However, the consideration of the
correlations in the outercore region (tables III and IV) leads to an increase of these

errors (due to a rather large smoothing region for the nodeless outercore 5s, 5p, 5d pseu-
dospinors3) up to 200 cm−1. These results are in a good agreement with that from table III
in paper [4] where a signiﬁcant increase in the GRECP errors can be observed for the case of
excitations from the 5d shell. One should expect that the contribution from the correlations

2 Electrons are included in the calculations in the following order: 6p, 6s; 5d; 5p; 5s; 4f ; . . .

3 We suggest that these GRECP errors can be seriously reduced due to more artiﬁcial generator
conﬁguration selection and smoothing procedure and with the help of corrections to the GRECP
operator (see [5], subsection 4.5) because these errors arise from electronic structure reorganization
in the outercore region.

the outercore region to low excitation energies and GRECP errors in their reproducting

will be reduced when passing from Hg toward Rn.

The errors of diﬀerent RECPs for the case of 20 correlated electrons are presented in
table IV. The errors of the GRECP are only about 4 times less than that of Ross et al.’s
RECP [6] and about 7

times less than that of the energy-adjusted PP [7] for the same number of electrons
explicitly included in calculations. This is also in agreement with the results from table III
in paper [4] where the ratio between GRECP errors and errors of the other RECPs was
reduced from one order of magnitude (when excitations only for the valence electrons were
under consideration) to 1.5–2 times (for the case of excitations from the outercore shells
described by nodeless pseudospinors). In fact, additional changes in the RECP errors when
the OC-V correlations are taken into account (tables II and IV) are within 200 cm−1 for the
used GRECP variants and within 400 cm−1 for the other RECPs. The main reason is the
spinor smoothing which has similar features for all these RECPs.

The data from the MRCI calculations with the energy-adjusted PP using the CIPSO
method for the transitions between the ﬁrst four states from table 6 in paper [7] are within
100 cm−1 with the experimental data but the 20 electron PP does not take into account
contributions from the correlations with the 4f shell (which are up to

1/26p1

700 cm−1) and the used basis set does not contain functions with h orbital momentum
(their contributions are up to 300 cm−1). Therefore, these data are results from cancelation
of a few contributions: PP errors (e.g., the 6s1
3/2(J = 2) splitting is
overestimated about 1000 cm−1 by the energy-adjusted PP because of the features of the
spin-orbit simulation in the LS-based variant of the energy-adjusted scheme), a neglect of
the correlations with the 4f shell, a basis set incompleteness, etc. The estimation of error
for these data within 5% [7] appears to be correct. The data in paper [11] were obtained
with the 12 electron RECP of Ross et al. which diﬀers from the used here 20 electron RECP.
One can see from tables I, II, and IV that the errors of the 20 and 34 electron GRECPs
are of the same order of magnitude because the main distinctions between these GRECP
variants are

1/2(J = 0)–6s1

inclusion of the 4f electrons in calculations with the 34 electron GRECP and smoothing
the 5f spinors for the 20 electron GRECP. However, the 34 electron GRECP allows one to
take into account explicitly the correlations with the 4f shell which are important for an
agreement with the experimental data within 200 cm−1. As one can see from table V, the
34 electron GRECP errors are within 200 cm−1 in this case.

The basis set truncation eﬀect at diﬀerent orbital quantum numbers on energies of ex-
citations from the ground state can be observed in tables V and VI for the 34e-CI/MBPT2

account the correlations with the 5d shell properly. This leads to the excitation energies
(table VI) rather close to that from the 2e-CI calculations. Addition of functions

with f orbital momentum is crucial for description of these correlations and leads to
an increase in the excitation energies on 2000–4000 cm−1. The excitation energies for the
(spdf ) basis set are within 900 cm−1 from that for the (spdf gh) basis set (tables V and VI).
In turn, (spdf ) basis set is inadequate for description of the correlations with the 4f shell.
The results for this basis set are rather close to that from the 20e-CI/MBPT2 calculations
in table IV. Addition of functions with g orbital momentum is necessary for the correct
description of these correlations and gives the contribution 300–600 cm−1 to the excitation
energies (table VI) whereas addition of h functions contributes about 300 cm−1 (table V).
Our test calculations showed that the contribution from functions with i orbital momentum
is of order 50 cm−1.

One can see from comparison between the 6 and 7 columns in tables I, II, and IV that

the errors

due to the gaussian approximation of the GRECP components are approximately one
order of magnitude less than the errors of the numerical GRECP. As one can see from
tables I, II, IV, and V, the eﬀects of diﬀerent nuclear models may be neglected for accuracy
within 200 cm−1.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The GRECP allows one to reproduce the electronic structure in the valence and outercore

regions essentially better than the other tested RECPs for

the same number of explicitly treated electrons.
At least 34 external electrons (occupying the 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, 6s, 6p shells) of mercury atom
should be correlated and the one-electron basis set should contain up to h angular mo-
mentum functions in order to obtain a reliable agreement with experimental data for low
excitation energies within 200 cm−1 whereas the errors of the gaussian approximation of the
GRECP components and the eﬀects of diﬀerent nuclear models are negligible for this accu-
racy. However, our test calculations show that the main contribution from the correlations
with the 4f shell is due to the one-electron correction from the self-energy diagrams [2],
therefore, this contribution can be taken into account for 20 electron GRECP with the help
of the technique proposed in [5] (subsection 5.2).

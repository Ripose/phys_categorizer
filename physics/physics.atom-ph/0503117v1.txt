Abstract

We present experimental results, as well as numerical simulations, for the transverse
velocity distribution of ions stored in an electrostatic ion beam trap. The measure-
ments indicate that the transverse velocity spread is about 1% of the longitudinal
velocity, and that the ions ﬁll the whole transverse stable phase space. We also
demonstrate that ion losses from the trap due to multiple scattering with molecules
from the residual gas is an important factor limiting the lifetime of the beam.

Key words:

ion traps, multiple scattering, cooling

1 Introduction

The use and development of ion trapping techniques, which started about 50
years ago [1], have led to a broad range of discoveries and new experiments in
physics and chemistry. In particular, one can cite high precision spectroscopy,
mass measurements, particle dynamics, nuclear and atomic processes and the
measurement of fundamental constants [2]. During the last few years, a new
type of ion trap has been developed in which ion beams, instead of ion clouds,
are trapped[3,4]. This new trap stores particles using only electrostatic ﬁelds
and works on a principle similar to that of an optical resonator. The main ad-
vantages of the trap are the possibility to trap fast (keV) beams without need
of deceleration, the well deﬁned beam direction, easy access to the trapped
beam by various probes, and simple requirements in terms of external beam
injection. Diﬀerent types of experiments have already been performed with

these traps, such as the measurement of metastable state lifetimes of atomic
and molecular ions [5,6], the lifetimes of metastable negative ions [7,8], and
electron impact detachment cross sections of negative clusters [9]. Cluster
cooling has also been observed [10]. Interesting dynamics of the ion motion
have been discovered, such as self-bunching (due to the so-called negative
mass instability phenomenon) and the possibility of using simple phase space
manipulation to reduce the velocity spread [11,12]. Electrostatic ion storage
rings[13,14] have also been used during the last several years in a variety of
experiments[15,16].

Although the motion of the ions in the trap can be readily simulated, no
measurements of the transverse velocity distribution (TVD) of the stored beam
have hitherto been performed. The TVD is needed to understand the trapping
eﬃciency, as well as the beam loss processes, especially the ones related to
multiple scattering. We describe here the method that we have developed to
characterize the TVD of the stored ions. The results are compared to numerical
trajectory simulations, which conﬁrm that multiple scattering is the dominant
loss process in these traps, and that the available area of the stable transverse
phase space directly inﬂuences the lifetime of the trapped ion beam.

2 Experimental setup

2.1 Ion trap

Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the electrostatic ion trap and the detection
system. Two diﬀerent setups were used for creating the ions. For light ions,
an electron impact ionization source was used and the ions were mass selected
with two magnets. For heavier species, a matrix assisted laser desorption and
ionization (MALDI)[17] source was used to create an ion bunch, which was
mass selected using time of ﬂight. In both cases, the ions were accelerated to
an energy of 4.2 keV. Three diﬀerent types of ions were used in this work: Au+
(m=197) and singly charged angiotensin II (m=1046) (both produced by the
MALDI source), and Ar+ (m=40) (produced by the electron impact source).
After focusing and collimation, the beam is directed into the ion trap along
its axis. A complete description of the ion trap is given in Ref. [4], and only
the details relevant for the present experiment will be given here.

The trap is made of two identical cylindrically symmetric “electrostatic mir-
rors” that both trap the beam in the longitudinal direction and focus it in the
lateral direction. Upon injection, the entrance set of electrodes (left side in
Fig. 1) is grounded so that the ion bunch can reach the exit mirror (right hand
side in Fig. 1), where they are reﬂected. Before the reﬂected bunch reaches

2

∼

the entrance electrodes, the potentials of these electrodes are rapidly switched
on (
100 ns rise time) to the same values as those of the exit electrodes. For
proper choices of voltages, the ions bounce back and forth between the two
mirrors, their lifetime being limited mainly by collisions with the residual gas
10−10 Torr when
molecules. The low pressure in the trap, of the order of 5
×
10−11 Torr for the MALDI setup,
the electron impact source was used, and 4
is maintained by a cryopump.

×

Each electrostatic mirror comprises eight electrodes. The potentials of the
electrodes labeled V1 to V4 and Vz in Fig. 1 are independently adjustable. The
other electrodes are always grounded. Thus the 228 mm long central region
of the trap between the two innermost electrodes is essentially ﬁeld-free. The
diameter of the central hole is 16 mm in the outer six electrodes and 26 mm in
the two innermost electrodes. The distance between the outermost electrodes
is 407 mm.

In order for the ions to be trapped, the electrode potentials have to satisfy
certain conditions. It is well known that many principles of geometric optics
can be applied to ion optics. In fact, our trap is based on a optical resonator
made of two cylindrically symmetric mirrors [18]. For an optical resonator with
identical mirrors and a Gaussian beam, the stability criterion (for a beam close
to the symmetry axis) is related to the focusing properties of the mirrors:

L/4

f

,

≤

≤ ∞

(1)

where f is the focal length of each mirror and L is the distance between
them. This condition is easy to fulﬁll with the above design. Another obvious
requirement is that the maximum potential on the mirror axis, Vmax, has to
be high enough to reﬂect the ions , i.e., qVmax > Ek, where q is the charge of
the ions and Ek is their kinetic energy.

Some important aspects of the design should be emphasized. First, the trap is
completely electrostatic, so there is no limit on the mass that can be trapped.
Second, the trapping depends only on the ratio Ek/q, which means that ions
of diﬀerent mass that are accelerated through the same potential diﬀerence
can be stored simultaneously. Third, the central part of the ion trap is (nearly)
ﬁeld-free, so the ions travel in straight lines in this region.

Various electrode voltage conﬁgurations are possible to achieve trapping. We

symmetric conﬁgurations, i.e., where identical potentials are applied to the two
mirrors, are considered. The potentials on the four outmost electrodes were

was varied between 2700 < Vz < 3200 V and 4000 < Vz < 4300 V. These
two ranges correspond to the known values where the trap is stable, i.e., they
satisfy the criterion Eq. 1, as has been shown in Ref. [18]. Additional details
about trapping stability and the comparison to optical models can be found
in the literature[18].

2.2 Detection system

One of the ion loss processes from the trap is charge exchange, which leads
to neutralization of the stored particles. These neutral particles pass freely
through the mirrors and can be detected by a microchannel plate (MCP)
detector located downstream of the trap (see Fig. 1). The detector is coupled
to a phosphor screen so that the spatial distribution of the neutral particles
exiting the trap can be imaged. The location and size of the MCP was diﬀerent
for the two diﬀerent ion source setups used in this work: The MCP was 25
mm in diameter, and located at a distance of 80.3 cm from the center of the
trap for the MALDI setup, while for the electron impact ionization source the
MCP was 40 mm in diameter, and located at a distance of 90.3 cm from the
center of the trap. The imaging is performed by a charge-coupled device (CCD)
camera located outside the vacuum that is connected to a frame grabber which
digitizes the picture in real time. The ﬁrst image is taken in coincidence with
the raising of the potentials on the entrance mirror, and subsequent images
1 s). The
are digitized at a rate of 25 Hz for the whole trapping time (
positions of impact ((x, y) on the front surface of the MCP) are determined
for all hits producing an amount of light (as measured by the CCD camera)
above a preprogrammed threshold. Images of about 50 to 150 injections are
averaged to produce statistically signiﬁcant results. The radial coordinate r is
calculated as

∼

r =

(x

−

(2)

where (x0, y0) is the point where the trap axis crosses the detector plane. This
point is determined at a later stage by ﬁnding the center of the measured
radial distribution.

2.3 Data analysis

In order to study the TVD inside the trap, we analyze the radial distribution
of the neutral particles hitting the MCP detector. Fig. 1 shows the relation-
ship between the ion position and velocity inside the trap at the instant of its

4

neutralization, and the point of impact of the neutralized particle on the de-
tector, r. The ion’s position at the neutralization point is given by its distance
R from the optical axis of the trap and distance from the MCP, s. The ion’s
velocity at the same point is deﬁned in terms of its longitudinal and transver-
sal velocities vq and v⊥, respectively (see Fig. 1). If we assume that the angular
scattering taking place during the charge exchange is small compared to the
angular dispersion of the beam (a very good approximation for the heavy ions
created in the MALDI source)[19], then the position of impact on the MCP
can be calculated from

If we also use the fact that R

where m is the particle mass. Two problems arise from this simple formula:
First, the velocities vq and v⊥ are not constant in the trap, as the particles
are slowed down and focused (or defocused, see Ref. [18]) inside the mirrors.
Second, the exact distance s between the neutralization point in the trap
and the MCP is unknown. The importance of these two eﬀects, which can
smear the radial distribution measurement, will be treated separately using
numerical simulation, as described in the next Section.

3 Numerical simulations

In order to verify the diﬀerent approximations made in the derivation of Eq. 4,
and to provide a better understanding of the trap behavior, we have performed
numerical simulations of the particle trajectories in the actual potentials of
the ion trap. The calculations were carried out using SIMION [20], which can
solve the Laplace equation for a speciﬁc potential conﬁguration in space and
propagate ions on the computed potential grid. The program uses a fourth-
order Runge-Kutta method to solve the Newtonian equations of motion. The
density of ions in the trap is assumed to be low enough for ion-ion interactions
to be neglected, and the trajectories are calculated for one ion at a time (the
actual number of ions in the trap was of the order of 105 ions per injection).

For diﬀerent values of Vz, while keeping the other potentials constant, we have
traced the stable trajectories, starting from an initial distribution that covers
the whole transverse stable (i.e., trapped) phase space of the electrostatic trap,
as described in Ref. [18]. The stable phase space was found by systematically

5

varying the initial conditions of the particles. A stable trajectory was deﬁned
as one for which a propagated ion was trapped for more than 500 µs (about
200 oscillations for 4.2 keV Ar+, or 90 for 4.2 keV Au+). It was found that ions
in unstable trajectories were usually lost from the trap after a few oscillations
(< 20 µs). The calculations were made using a constant integration time step,
and the positions and velocities of the ions were recorded in a ﬁle at each of
these time steps. Using this information, simulated distributions for the radial
distribution at the MCP were calculated by assuming an equal probability
for neutralization at each of these integration time steps, and propagating the
(neutral) particles in straight lines, using the initial positions and velocities as
recorded. This method has the advantage of representing faithfully the local
ion density along the length of the trap. Implicit in the assumption of equal
probability of neutralization in each time step is the assumption that the
neutralization cross section is independent of kinetic energy for energies below
4.2 keV[21], even in the mirrors where the kinetic energies approach zero. The
results can then be directly compared to the experimental distributions.

4 Experimental and Simulation Results

Figure 2 shows a comparison between the measured (dotted line) and simu-
lated (solid line) normalized distributions for the distance squared (P (r2)) at
the MCP for 4.2 keV Au+, and Vz=3200 V. We choose to plot the r2 distri-
butions as they display the radial density information in the most relevant
manner. The number of particles located in an interval of width d(r2) = 2rdr
is proportional to the number of particles in the ring between r and r + dr,
whose area is given by 2πrdr. Similar distributions were measured for Ar+
and angiotensin II+ ions. Each of the measured distributions was character-
ized by the standard deviation of the radial distribution which in the present
case is equal to the square root of the mean of r2: σr = √< r2 >. Using Eq. 4,
and replacing r by σr and s by the distance from the center of the trap to
the MCP, typical transverse velocities v⊥ could be obtained for the diﬀerent
masses and values of the Einzel lens voltage (Vz). Figure 3 shows the results
for the three diﬀerent ions as a function of Vz. Only a weak dependence of
transverse velocity v⊥ on Vz is observed, except for Ar+ around 3250 V. The
ratio v⊥/vq

10−3 is found to be approximately constant for all ions.

Based on the excellent agreement between the experimental data and the sim-
ulations (see Fig. 2), one can now use the simulation to check the assumptions
which led to Eq. 4, especially the assumption related to the contribution of
the neutral particles produced inside the mirrors to P (r2) and the unknown
distance between the neutralization point and the MCP. Figure 4 shows an
example of the distribution of the square of the transverse velocity P (v2
⊥) from
Simion simulations. The case presented is for all stable Ar+ ions in the ﬁeld-

6

free region of the trap, for an Einzel lens voltage of Vz=3300 V. To compare
this distribution to the experimentally deduced typical transverse velocity, we
characterize this distribution in a similar way as the squared radial distribution
(see Fig. 2), using the square root of its mean, which is equivalent to the stan-
dard deviation of the TVD, yielding σv⊥=1.16 mm/µs. This value is slightly
lower than the one derived directly from the measured radial distributions
(see Fig. 3), as can be expected since the latter includes some contributions
from slower ions inside the mirrors that tend to have also larger v⊥/vq ratio.
However, the diﬀerence is relatively small (the reduced detection eﬃciency of
the MCP for the slower particles also contributes to the fact that these have
a minor eﬀect on the measured distributions), and we conclude that the data
shown in Fig. 3 are an upper limit of the transverse velocity of the trapped
ions in the central (ﬁeld-free) region of the trap.

5 Transverse phase space

The results obtained in the previous section show that the measured and sim-
ulated transverse velocities are in good agreement. Since the simulated value
is obtained by ﬁlling the stable phase space of the trap, one can conclude that
the ions stored in the trap always ﬁll the available (stable) transverse phase
space. This has an important implication as far as the ion loss processes are
concerned. As pointed out previously [18], two processes play an important
role in limiting the lifetime of the ions in the trap. The ﬁrst is neutralization
of the ions via charge exchange with the residual gas molecules, and the sec-
ond is multiple scattering, which increases the transverse velocity of the ions
until they reach the limit of the stable transverse phase space. Although the
importance of the neutralization process can be observed experimentally by
counting the number of neutral particles exiting the trap, the importance of
multiple scattering is more diﬃcult to observe experimentally. Also, it is quite
clear that the loss due to neutralization is independent of the trap conﬁgu-
ration, while the loss due to multiple scattering will be strongly dependent
on the available transverse phase space, if the stable transverse phase space
is always full. The fact that the measured transverse velocity is found to be
equal to the one extracted from a simulated ”full transverse phase space”
suggests that the loss due to multiple scattering is very important, and that
the lifetime of the ions is mostly limited by this process, a conclusion which
was already reached by Pedersen et al. [18] using arguments based on known
angular scattering cross sections.

In order to demonstrate the importance of multiple scattering as a loss process,
we have calculated the area of the stable transverse phase space for the Ar+
ions as a function of the Einzel lens voltage Vz. The area was calculated by
recording the transverse position and velocity for each pass of a stable ion

7

through the midplane of the trap. A scatter plot of these coordinates was
then made, and the area ﬁlled by the points was estimated by dividing the
phase space into a ﬁne grid and counting the number of cells for which at
least four points were found. These cells are then called ”stable cells” (the
minimum number of points required for a cell to be deﬁned as stable has only
a small inﬂuence on the ﬁnal results). Fig. 5(a) shows the results of such a
calculation as a function of Vz, while Fig. 5(b) shows the lifetime of the ions in
the trap, as obtained by measuring the rate of neutral Ar hitting the MCP as
a function of storage time and ﬁtting the decay using an exponential function.
A clear correspondence between the lifetime and the area of the transverse
phase space is observed, including the dip around Vz=3200 V.

6 Conclusions

We have measured the transverse velocity distribution of 4.2 keV Ar+, Au+,
and angiotensin II+ stored in a linear electrostatic ion trap. The results show
that the width of the TVD is mass dependent, and represents about 1% of the
longitudinal beam velocity for the present trap geometry. The experimental
results are in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation. More impor-
tant, it shows that in the existing experimental setup, the phase space of the
trap is ﬁlled very soon after injection. Thus, we can expect multiple scatter-
ing to be an important ion loss process (the other being neutralization). This
is also demonstrated by the correlation between the area of transverse phase
space and the measured lifetimes.

A consequence of our results is that the lifetime in the trap will also be a
function of the trap length. Indeed, for a given angular dispersion of the beam
and for a given mirror geometry, a trap with longer distance between the
mirrors will be less stable, as the particles will be further away from the
central axis of the trap when they enter the mirrors. On the other hand,
although shorter traps will probably be more stable, they can store less ions.

The tool that we have developed to measure the transverse velocity distri-
bution of the stored ions can now be used in studies of transverse cooling.
Speciﬁcally, if a kicker for stochastic cooling is installed in the ﬁeld-free region
of the trap, it should be possible to shrink the r2 distribution, and thereby in-
crease the storage lifetime. Moreover, because of Coulomb repulsion between
the ions (especially near the turning points in the mirrors) and the radial
mixing induced by the mirror, we can expect that transverse cooling will also
aﬀect the longitudinal velocity distribution.

Fig. 1: Schematic view of the experimental setup. The bunch is injected
through the left hand side of the trap (entrance electrodes), and the neutral
particles escaping from the trap through the exit electrodes are counted by
the MCP detector, whose phosphor screen is imaged by a CCD camera. The
drawing is not to scale.
Fig. 2: Normalized r2 distributions for 4.2 keV Au+. Dotted line: measured
by the MCP detector; solid line: simulation with Simion[20]. The Einzel lens
voltage was 3200 V.
Fig. 3: Measured transverse velocity as a function of the Einzel lens volt-
); angiotensin II+ (N). The
age for three diﬀerent ions: Ar+ ((cid:4)); Au+ (
transverse velocity is set to zero for unstable conﬁgurations.
Fig. 4: Calculated transverse velocity distribution in the ﬁeld-free region of
the trap for Ar+ ions with Vz=3300 V.
Fig. 5: (a) Area of the stable transverse phase space in the midplane of the
trap as a function of Vz. (b) Measured lifetime for Ar+ as a function of Vz.

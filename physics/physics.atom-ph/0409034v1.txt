(Dated: February 20, 2014)

In a framework of classical dynamics we develop a new classiﬁcation scheme for multi-electron
trajectories in terms of sequences of binary electron collisions. The Wannier threshold law σ ∝ Eα
for four-body break-up of Lithium is conﬁrmed and it is shown that α deviates experimentally due
to its determination between 2 − 5 eV above threshold. For the angular distribution of the ionized
◦
electrons we do not ﬁnd a preferential symmetric break-up with an interelectronic angle of 120
as
predicted by Wannier’s theory. However, the angular pattern is consistent with an analysis in terms
of binary collisions. Our results are expected to hold generally for three-electron dynamics.

Triple photoionization of Lithium is the most funda-
mental atomic process involving three bound electrons.
Only recently Wehlitz et al. succeeded in measuring the
triple photoionization cross section down to 2 eV above
threshold [1, 2]. Subsequent experiments have produced
various double ionization cross sections, also very close
to threshold. For Lithium [3] and most recently Beryl-
lium [4], it was demonstrated convincingly that the dou-
ble photoionization cross section has small oscillations
superimposed on the raising smooth cross section. This
has cast some doubt on the validity of Wannier’s (classi-
cally derived) threshold law [5] which predicts very close
to threshold a power law behavior of the cross section,

σ(Eω) ∝ (Eω/I − 1)α ,

(1)

where Eω is the photon energy, I the respective threshold
energy and α a characteristic exponent which is related
to the stability of a classical ﬁxed point of the N -electron
dynamics [6].

For the present case of Lithium triple ionization (I =
7.478 a.u.) the experimental results reach only down to 2
eV above threshold and the corresponding ﬁt with Eq. (1)
yields αexp = 2.05. It is known from the well studied two-
electron escape case [7] that a Wannier exponent ﬁtted
to a cross section over an energy interval which is close
but a ﬁnite distance away from threshold yields always
a smaller α than the analytically predicted one. Hence,
the experimental value is consistent with Wannier’s pre-
diction but not conclusive since one does not know what
happens closer to threshold.

The present classical study deals for the ﬁrst time with
the full four-body problem close to threshold and pro-
vides the triple ionization probability starting at E =
0.9 eV excess energy. We are able to conﬁrm that, indeed,
the Wannier threshold law with an exponent of α = 2.16
is reached, but only for energies E ≡ Eω − I < 2eV.
By successively ﬁtting ﬁnite energy intervals above the
threshold I to our result, we can conﬁrm the experimen-
tal result for α. Moreover, we develop a novel classiﬁca-
tion technique for the classical triple ionization trajecto-
ries. It allows us to group them according to the sequel of

electron-electron collisions thereby providing insight into
the mechanism and dynamics of triple ionization, par-
ticularly regarding the relative direction of the outgoing
electron momenta.
It is vital to provide an automatic
classiﬁcation of the trajectories which detects the colli-
sions since a manual search through up to 1010 trajecto-
ries for each value of photon energy is impossible.

For double ionization of Helium it has been shown
that classical ionization dynamics in combination with a
Wigner representation of the initial coupling of the pho-
ton to the bound state of the electrons describes the cross
section very well close to threshold where the shake-oﬀ
contribution to the cross section can be neglected [8].
Similarly as in a non-absolute measurement we calculate
the classical triple-ionization probability P 3+ and obtain
the cross section by multiplying with the known total
photo absorption cross section σabs,

σ3+ = σabsP 3+ .

(2)

Physically interpreted, this relation splits the photon ab-
sorption (σabs) from the subsequent energy redistribution
in the three-electron system. The latter can lead to triple
ionization which we calculate in phase space from

P 3+ = lim

dΓP 3+ exp((t − tabs)Lcl)ρ(Γ),

(3)

t→∞ Z

with the classical Liouvillian Lcl
for the four-body
Coulomb system propagated from the time tabs of photo
absorption [8]. The primary electron absorbs the photon
at the nucleus (r1 = 0), an approximation which becomes
exact in the limit of high photon energy [9]. Immediately
after absorption, the phase space distribution of the re-
maining two electrons is the Wigner transform of the cor-
responding initial wavefunction ψ(r1 = 0, r2, r3), where
the ri are the electron vectors starting at the nucleus.
In general, close to threshold the ionization probability
does not depend on the details of the initial wavefunc-
tion [5]. Hence, we approximate it as a simple product
of hydrogenic orbitals φZi
i (ri) with eﬀective charges Zi to
facilitate the Wigner transformation. The Zi are chosen
to reproduce the known ionization potentials Ii, namely

2

proached in the limit of vanishing threshold energy. To
this end we have ﬁtted σ3+ = σ0(E/I)α, where σ0 and α
are ﬁt parameters while I is the triple ionization poten-
tial. For the closest energy interval to threshold we could
reach, 0.9 eV ≤ E ≤ 2 eV, α = 2.15 very close to Wan-
nier’s value of α = 2.16, as the inset to Fig. 1 reveals. We
then apply the ﬁt, keeping the lower limit of the energy
interval constant, E = 0.9 eV, and increasing the upper
energy limit until we reach E = 4.0 eV (the experimen-
tal α is obtained in the range 2 − 5.1 eV = 3.1 eV). We
then shift the 3.1 eV interval to higher excess energies to
obtain α as a function of the upper limit of the energy
range [14], see inset to Fig. 1. The inset also illustrates
that a power law ﬁt which starts at a ﬁnite energy will al-
ways produce an exponent lower than Wannier’s. Hence,
the ﬁt to the experimental data (ﬁlled circle in the inset
to Fig. 1) is consistent with Wannier’s prediction and in
good agreement with our present theoretical result.

As a next step we take a closer look at the triple ion-
ization dynamics in terms of momentum transferring bi-
nary collisions between electrons receding from the nu-
cleus. Responsible for momentum transfer between elec-
trons i and j is their Coulomb repulsion V (rij ) = r−1
ij ,
rij = ri − rj. We identify the binary electron collision ij
through the momentum transfer

∆pij := −

∇V (rij ) dt

under the condition that V (rij (tk)), k = 1, 2 are local
minima in time with t2 > t1. This automatically ensures
that the integral of Eq. (5) includes the “collision” with
a local maximum of V (rij (tk)) at a time t1 < tM < t2.
Since we want to classify the three-electron trajectories
according to binary collisions we keep the deﬁnition from
Eq. (5) which is of course only meaningful if the collision
indeed redistributes energy dominantly in the subsystem
given by the two-electron Li+-Hamiltonian Hij of the
electrons i and j involved in the actual collision. This is
the case if the energy in the subsystem Hij changes little
over the collision, i.e.,
dHij /dt dt ≪ E, where E is
the total energy of the Li-Hamiltonian.

Finally, we need a sensitivity threshold to register
only the important collisions. This is done individu-
ally for each trajectory by forming the maximum ∆P =
maxi6=j {|∆pij|} and normalizing each collision according
to ∆pij ≡ |∆pij |/∆P . A collision is only registered in
the following if ∆pij > δ. The resulting classiﬁcation
shown in Fig. 2 does not sensitively depend on the exact
value of δ which we have chosen to be δ = 1/8. We have
traced the 5 most important collision sequences si over a
wide range of energies. Their relative probability Psi (E)
as a function of excess energy is easy to understand. In
general, trajectories with fewer collisions carry a higher
weight. The process s1={12,13} has the highest weight
for low excess energy where the primary electron (after

the 1s electron Z2 = 2.358 (I2 = 2.780 a.u.). We use
atomic units throughout the paper if not stated other-
wise. The Wigner distribution W conserves energy only
in the mean [10]. Near E = 0, however, energy conser-
vation is vital. Therefore, the Wigner functions for the
individual electron orbitals are restricted to their respec-
tive energy shell, leading ﬁnally to the initial phase space
distribution

With ρ(Γ) from Eq. (4) the initial phase space vol-
ume to be sampled reduces signiﬁcantly, although regu-
larized coordinates [11] are required to avoid problems
with electron trajectories starting at the nucleus. Other
than that, the integral in Eq. (3) is evaluated with a
standard Monte-Carlo technique which entails following
classical trajectories in phase space [8]. The projector
P 3+ indicates that we integrate only over those parts of
phase space that lead to triple ionization. With the help
of Eq. (2) the resulting probability P 3+ leads to the triple
ionization cross section σ3+ shown in Fig. 1 together with
the experimental data. Considering the approximations
we had to make to handle the four-body problem the
agreement of experiment and theory is remarkably good,
particularly towards threshold. Hence, our classical ap-
proach with an approximate initial quantum wavefunc-
tion seems to capture the relevant correlations among
the three electrons which mainly form after the photo
absorption at lower excess energies. This allows us to
ask whether Wannier’s power law for σ3+ is really ap-

absorption of the photon) is still slow enough to easily
transfer energy, ﬁrst to electron 2 and then to electron
3. For higher energy the competing process s2={12,23}
takes over because the primary electron is after its ﬁrst
collision with electron 2 still so fast that the interaction
with the more loosely bound 2s electron 3 is small. It is
more eﬃcient that after the initial collision 12 electron
2 transfers part of the energy it has gained on to elec-
tron 3 in the collision 23. Although the third process in-
volves only two collisions, s5={13,12}, it contributes less
than 10 %, i.e., on the same level as the three-collision
processes, mainly, because it is diﬃcult for the outgoing
photo electron 1 to hit the“outer” 2s electron ﬁrst and
then the “inner” 1s electron.

We turn now to the analysis in terms of binary electron
collisions which can explain the distribution C(θ) of rel-
ative angles between the escaping electrons as shown in
Fig. 3. The shape of C(θ) for the high energy of E = 420
eV might have been expected from the dominant contri-
bution of impulsive binary collisions: a maximum near
90◦ with a slight push to larger angles indicating the
(small) inﬂuence of the Coulomb repulsion (the thin line
is to guide the eye). The double hump structure near
threshold (E=0.9 eV), however, is somewhat surprising.
Wannier’s prediction of a symmetric break-up with an
inter-electronic angle of 120◦ is not realized at this ex-
cess energy. Rather, the angular distribution can be rep-
resented by two peaks, about 90◦ and 180◦ with

C(θ) = c0 sin θ[c⊥ sinβ(θ) + ck sinβ(θ/2)]

(6)

shown as thick solid line in Fig. 3. While c0 is an overall
normalization, the form of Eq. (6), including the value
β for the (equal) width of the peaks and their relative
weights c⊥, ck follows directly from an analysis of the
angular distribution in terms of the sequence of binary
collisions. We restrict our considerations to the two pro-
cesses s1 and s2 since they contribute about 84% to all

triple ionizing trajectories. Fig. 4 shows the angular dis-
tributions separated according to s1 and s2, and the last
collision (open symbols) in each process. As it is evi-
dent the last collision (13 for s1 and 23 for s2) always
leads to an angle of roughly 180◦, between the respec-
k (θ) = cij
tive electrons, i.e., Cij
k sin θ sinβ(θ/2) (dotted
lines in Fig. 4). On the other hand, the four electron
pairs (ij) not involved in the last collision, (23) for s1,
(13) for s2 and (12) for both processes, leave the nucleus
preferentially under a mutual angle of 90◦ which means
Cij
⊥ (θ) = cij
⊥ sin θ sinβ(θ), shown as solid lines in Fig. 4.
Geometrically, this implies that the electron not involved
in the last collision escapes in the plane perpendicular to
the vector rij deﬁned by the back-to-back escape of the
electrons from the last collision. Any ﬁnite distribution
of the electron directions from the last collision about
180◦ will translate into a distribution of equal width for
the electron leaving in the perpendicular plane. Hence,
we expect the width β in the ﬁt to be the same. This is
indeed the case, both Cij
k (θ) in Fig. 4 have
a width of β = 17.6. Note that the thin solid line is
simply proportional to sin θ which corresponds to equal
probability for all angles due to the angular line element
sin θdθ (see also Eq. (6)).

⊥ (θ) and Cij

The sum of the weights cij

⊥ for the four electron pairs
that recede from the nucleus preferentially under a mu-
tual angle of 90◦ (see above) give c⊥ in Eq. (6). Cor-
respondingly, ck contains the contribution from the two
electron pairs that are involved in the last collision, pair
13 (s1) and 23 (s2). The normalization is c0 = 1.18 =
100/84 reﬂecting the fact that s1 and s2 account for 84%
of all triple ionizing trajectories.
Inserting these con-
stants into Eq. (6) produces the thick solid curve in Fig. 3
in good agreement with the data points.

The analysis of the binary collisions reveals a smooth
change with excess energy consistent with a smooth
change of the ionization cross section as it is evident from

the agreement of our Lithium calculation regarding the
shape of the ionization cross section with Neon and Ar-
gon that the diﬀerent binding energies do not strongly
inﬂuence the shape of the cross section.

In summary we have analyzed triple photoionization of
Lithium near threshold using classical mechanics. We can
conﬁrm Wannier’s prediction that the triple photoion-
ization cross section grows with the power α = 2.16 of
the excess energy from threshold. We have introduced a
new automated classiﬁcation scheme for multiple electron
trajectories by grouping all triple ionizing trajectories ac-
cording to their sequence of binary electron collisions. It
has allowed us to understand in a simple way the mu-
tual electronic angular distribution thereby demonstrat-
ing that N -electron systems (N > 2) are qualitatively
diﬀerent from two-electron systems. While multiple elec-
tron dynamics may be understood in terms of sequences
of binary electron collisions such an analysis would be
meaningless for a two-electron atom with a single dom-
inant collision between the two electrons. We believe
that the classiﬁcation scheme introduced here provides a
natural way to access multiple electron ionization in the
future and might guide the way to a quantum mechanical
analysis along the lines of [16].

to obtain a dimensionless cross section σ/σM as a func-
tion of the dimensionless excess energy x = E/EM with
EM , σM as ﬁtting parameters. One sees that the ex-
perimental data for Li, Ar, and Ne fall on top of the
theoretical data from Fig. 1.
It has been argued that
a secondary power law, or at least additional structure
in the triple ionization cross section could originate from
the very diﬀerent binding energies for the electrons in the
Lithium atom with its 1s22s conﬁguration in contrast to
Neon and Argon which both contribute three electrons
from a single shell to the ionization (2p and 3p, respec-
tively) [2]. The present calculation does take into account
the diﬀerence in binding energy and spatial extension of
the respective orbitals. Hence, one may conclude from

We explore properties of atoms whose magnetic hyperﬁne sub-levels are coupled by an external
magnetic radio frequency (rf) ﬁeld. We perform a thorough theoretical analysis of this driven
system and present a number of systematic approximations which eventually give rise to dressed
adiabatic radio frequency potentials. The predictions of this analytical investigation are compared
to numerically exact results obtained by a wave packet propagation. We outline the versatility and
ﬂexibility of this new class of potentials and demonstrate their potential use to build atom optical
elements such as double-wells, interferometers and ringtraps. Moreover, we perform simulations of
interference experiments carried out in rf induced double-well potentials. We discuss how the nature
of the atom-ﬁeld coupling mechanism gives rise to a decrease of the interference contrast.

INTRODUCTION

Using static magnetic ﬁelds in order to gain control over the motion of neutral ground state atoms is a well-
established and frequently used experimental technique [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In particular for the manipulation of gases of
atoms in the thermal and the quantum degenerate regime magnetic ﬁelds have been successfully employed [6]. In the
adiabatic approximation the atoms are subjected to a potential which is proportional to the modulus of the magnetic
ﬁeld [4, 7]. Hence, since the ﬁeld generating structures can be almost designed at will there seems in principle to exist
a total freedom in designing potential ’landscapes’ [4, 8]. This virtual ﬂexibility has resulted in numerous proposals
about how to design atom-optical elements such as traps, guides and also interferometers [5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
However, Maxwell’s equations prevent magnetic traps from being designed entirely arbitrarily. Earnshaw’s theorem
for instance states that there are no local magnetic ﬁeld maxima allowed to occur inside a source-free region of space.
This puts signiﬁcant constraints onto the magnetic ﬁeld shapes and thus on the trapping potentials. These restrictions
can be circumvented by superimposing time-dependent magnetic ﬁeld components on the static ﬁelds. This give rise
to adiabatic potentials which show an enormous ﬂexibility and versatility [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. With the
support of such time-dependent ﬁelds one can create even complicated geometries such as rings and interferometers
with comparatively little eﬀort. Such atom optical elements are ideal tools to study interference [16, 21] and tunneling
[22] of Bose-Einstein Condensates.

In this paper we discuss in detail the theoretical foundations of the adiabatic potentials that emerge if the magnetic
hyperﬁne states of an alkali atom are being coupled by an external radio frequency (rf) ﬁeld. In Sec. II we present
the underlying Hamiltonian as well as a number of transformations and approximations which eventually give rise to
the adiabatic potentials which we present in Sec. III. These general considerations are followed by the discussion of
a speciﬁc ﬁeld conﬁguration in Sec. IV. We demonstrate how a very simple setup consisting of a Ioﬀe-Pritchard trap
[23] and two linearly polarized rf ﬁelds allow one to create a number of atom optical elements. In particular we outline
the realization of a tunable double well as well as a ring trap. These analytical results are conﬁrmed by a numerical
wave packet propagation which utilizes the exact spinor Hamiltonian. In Sec. V we discuss interference experiments
which are carried out by using an rf induced double-well. We outline how the atom-ﬁeld coupling which essentially
forms the rf potentials inﬂuences the outcome of interference experiments. In particular we ﬁnd an oscillation of the
interference phase and a reduction of contrast. We conclude and summarize our ﬁndings in Sec. VI.

II. GENERAL HAMILTONIAN OF RADIO FREQUENCY COUPLED HYPERFINE SUB-STATES

The ground state and the ﬁrst few excited states of an alkali atom are substantially split into several hyperﬁne-
manifolds being usually labeled by the quantum number F . In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld B(r, t) each of these
manifolds again splits into 2F + 1 branches. Let us assume the ﬁeld to be of moderate strength, i.e. not to couple
adjacent hyperﬁne-manifolds.
In this case the dynamics of an atom within a single manifold is governed by the
Hamiltonian

p2
2M

H =

+ gF µBF

B(r, t).

·

Here M is the atomic mass, F the 2F + 1-dimensional representation of the angular momentum operator and gF the
corresponding g-factor. We assume the magnetic ﬁeld to decompose according to

B(r, t) = BS(r) + BRF(r, t) = BS(r) +

Bn(r) cos(ωt

δn).

The static ﬁeld BS(r) serves for the purpose of trapping, i.e. there are trapped states even in the absence of the ﬁeld
BRF(r, t) being a monochromatic radio frequency (rf) ﬁeld which is used to couple the diﬀerent magnetic hyperﬁne
sub-states.

The static magnetic ﬁeld vector BS(r) deﬁnes a natural quantization axis which we refer to as the z-axis. To
manifest this in the following we construct a unitary transformation that rotates the angular momentum vector F
such that it is aligned with the local magnetic ﬁeld vector. Such a transformation which in general depends on the
position r of the atom is given by

As is seen here US(r) indeed performs the requested operation since the coupling to the static ﬁeld has become
proportional to Fz. The rotation induced by US(r) can be equivalently expressed in terms of the rotation matrices
Ri [φ] acting on the vector F. Here φ is the rotation angle and the index i denotes the axis around which the vector
is being rotated. However, instead of rotating F one can equally rotate the magnetic ﬁeld vector which leads to the
same result. This is exploited in the second last equality in the series of equations (5). Consequently, applying US(r)
to the Hamiltonian (1) yields

III. DRESSED ADIABATIC RADIO FREQUENCY INDUCED POTENTIALS

Since we have performed only unitary transformations the two Hamiltonians (12) and (1) are equivalent. At ﬁrst
glance it is not obvious that much has been gained since the Hamiltonian (12) appears to be extremely unhandy.
However, we will show that equation (12) serves as an excellent basis for performing a number of approximation.
Finally it will allow us to derive a time-independent expression for the dressed adiabatic potentials.

For the ﬁrst approximation we assume

ωLk the oscillating motion of the ﬁeld amplitude will dominate the Lamor precession around the magnetic ﬁeld
ωLk is not strictly satisﬁed, i.e. both frequencies diﬀer only by one order

This allows us to replace U †

In the next step we utilize the so-called rotating-wave-approximation which essentially consists of the negligence of

all terms that oscillate rapidly with a frequency 2ω. Accounting for equation (15) this give rise to the Hamiltonian

The dynamics of the spin particle is thus eﬀectively determined by a Hamiltonian which consists of two gauge potentials
A(r, t) and Φ(r, t) and a coupling to an eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld whose components read

Apart from the gauge potentials the new time-independent Hamiltonian has acquired the same form as our initial
Hamiltonian (1) but with a static eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld. The main advantage is now that Beﬀ is not to satisfy
Maxwell’s equations since it is no true magnetic ﬁeld. This is exactly the reason why combined static and rf ﬁelds
permit the design of a much larger variety of traps than it is possible by solely using static ﬁelds. Moreover, the
dependence of the ζn on the sign of the atomic g-factor enables one to realize state-dependent potentials as outlined
in Ref. [17].

To obtain the adiabatic rf potentials we diagonalize the last term of the Hamiltonian (16) by applying the trans-

formation

This transformation is similar to the one given by equation (3) but with the rotation angles ˜α(r) and ˜β(r) now being
deﬁned as

Finally we perform the adiabatic approximation which, just like for static magnetic traps [4, 24], essentially consists

of neglecting the gauge potential A′(r, t). This yields the adiabatic Hamiltonian

These potentials are time-independent and turn out to be extremely versatile in terms of their applicability. Of
course the validity of the approximation utilized in this section has to be ensured. However, it is hard to discuss
this in general and has therefore to be checked for the individual ﬁeld setup. In the next section we will restrict our
considerations to a speciﬁc case.

IV. TWO-DIMENSIONAL RF POTENTIALS

Let us now demonstrate how a very simple and easy to build experimental setup can give rise to extremely ver-
satile dressed adiabatic potentials that can be used for building atom optical elements such as beam-splitters and
interferometers.

To this end we consider two-dimensional potentials which are generated from a static Ioﬀe trap whose ﬁeld is given

The goal of the following discussion is two-fold: Firstly we will calculate the dressed adiabatic potentials arising
from the spin-ﬁeld coupling term of the Hamiltonian (27). We will point out the ﬂexibility of this rather simple ﬁeld
conﬁguration which enables one to create a number of atom optical elements. Secondly we want to compare our
results to a numerically exact wave packet propagation that is governed by the Schr¨odinger equation

which can now be used to propagate the coeﬃcients cnmmF (t) in time. For all practical purposes this system of ﬁrst
order diﬀerential equations has to be truncated yielding a set of equations of ﬁnite dimension. Then it can be solved
by using standard numerical integration methods. In particular we have used a Runge-Kutta integrator with adaptive
stepsize provided by the Nag library. This method is not norm-conserving. Thus we have to ensure the conservation
of the norm at any time step which at the same time serves as a measure of the quality of the propagation. During
the propagation we solely ramp up the rf ﬁeld strength BRF form zero to its ﬁnal value. All other parameters remain
unchanged. At t = 0 and consequently BRF = 0 the Hamiltonian (27) resembles that of a stationary Ioﬀe-Pritchard
trap. For a suﬃciently large Ioﬀe ﬁeld strength, i.e. Gρ

independent of the polar angle φ and hence rotationally symmetric. For our numerical wave packet propagation we
start again in the ground state (38) and at zero rf amplitude. Subsequently we ramp the rf amplitude to 0.446 Gauss
within 7.6 ms. This is done linearly at a constant rf frequency of ω = 2π

is depicted in ﬁgure 2. The initially Gaussian distribution is isotropically deformed until a ring-shaped wave function
emerges. For the parameters given the ﬁnal ring radius evaluates according to equation (32) to ρ0 = 1.08 µm which
is in very good agreement with the numerical simulation (one ﬁnds γ1,2 = 0.16).

INTERFERENCE EXPERIMENTS IN AN RF INDUCED DOUBLE-WELL

The excellent performance of rf induced potentials for conducting interference experiments has been both demon-
strated experimentally [16] and studied theoretically [17]. It was shown that by using the rf scheme splitting distances
of only a few microns can be achieved. Such small splittings cannot be observed directly by means of absorption
imaging. However, by switching oﬀ all magnetic ﬁelds (which is assumed to happen instantaneously) and after wait-
ing a suﬃciently long period of time the structure of the expanded cloud can be resolved. In case of an initially split
cloud usually an interference pattern is observed [16].

We will now discuss how the nature of the rf potentials gives rise to a reduction of the interference contrast. Assuming
a free propagation of the initial state being characterized by the wave function Ψ(x, t0) we ﬁnd the probability density

becomes large and the initial state is localized the position dependent phase
becomes approximately uniform over the extension of Ψ(x, t0) and can thus be taken out from
factor exp
the argument and put in front of the Fourier integral. In this case the the probability density after the time-of-ﬂight
period is simply the Fourier transform of Ψ(x, t0). Since Ψ(x, t0) is a spinor wave function the Fourier transform is
to be taken of each spinor component separately. Hence one would expect the occupation of the individual spinor
orbitals to have an eﬀect on the interference pattern. For the purpose of demonstration we now consider the ﬁnal
state of the wave packet propagation which is shown in ﬁgure 1.
In ﬁgure 3a we present the spin decomposition
of this particular state. The probability amplitude seems to be randomly distributed over the three spinor orbitals.

This is essentially a consequence of the diﬀerent spin states of the two interfering clouds.

The actual calculation of the interference pattern (3)b, however, yields a contrast of about 90 %. This modiﬁcation of
the interference pattern by the spatially asymmetric occupation of the spinor orbitals will be subject of the following
discussion.

We focus on the rf double-well which is described by equation (31) if δ = 0 or π. We consider the interference
pattern that emerges if two completely separated clouds which are located in the two wells interfere. For the purpose
of illustration we consider the one-dimensional dynamics along the axis which is deﬁned through the position of the
double-well minima

in ﬁgure 4b. This means that the spin states of the two initial, now interfering, fragments were not identical. It is
easily seen this eﬀect to lead to a reduction of the interference contrast and to a variation of the global phase of the

The above consideration assumes an immediate switch-oﬀ of all external magnetic ﬁelds before the expansion of
the matter wave. However, for all practical purposes there is always a ﬁnite switch oﬀ time. One might think of
switching oﬀ the ﬁelds such that ﬁnally all atoms are rotated into the same spin state but the spatial shape of the
matter wave remains unchanged. To succeed in establishing such a sophisticated switching-oﬀ procedure seems to be
unlikely since at each spatial and temporal position the atomic spin state had to be rotated diﬀerently.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have presented the theoretical foundations for the description of rf induced adiabatic potentials. Starting from
a Hamiltonian that takes into account the coupling of a single hyperﬁne manifold to an external ﬁeld we have carried
out a number of unitary transformations. After performing the rotating wave approximation and neglecting the non-
adiabatic couplings which emerge from the transformed kinetic energy we have received the corresponding adiabatic
potential surfaces.

To demonstrate the power of this rf induced dressed adiabatic potentials we have discussed a simple ﬁeld conﬁgura-
tion consisting of a static Ioﬀe-Pritchard trap and two orthogonal homogeneous rf ﬁelds. Our analytical calculations
have shown that by tuning the strength of the rf ﬁelds a smooth transition from a single well into a double well is
achievable. This transition can be easily exploited to split a cloud of ultracold atoms. By introducing a relative phase
shift between the two rf ﬁelds furthermore a transition from a double well to a ring potential can be performed. For our
considerations we have mainly focussed on 87Rb in the F = 1 hyperﬁne ground state. For this species the analytical
results have been veriﬁed by a numerical wave packet propagation which was conducted using a linear single particle
Schr¨odinger equation and the original Hamiltonian. For typical experimental parameters these numerical results have
been shown to be in very good agreement with the ones obtained from the analytic adiabatic approach.

Finally we have discussed interference experiments carried out in a rf double-well potential. Since the trapping
potential is a consequence of a spin-ﬁeld coupling the spin state of a trapped atom cloud depend on its actual spatial
position. This essentially leads to a spatially asymmetric distribution of the atomic wave function within the individual
spinor orbitals and an inevitable reduction of the interference contrast. Moreover, the rf ﬁeld imposes a high-frequency
oscillation on the interference fringes which is reminiscent of a micromotion. The magnitude of these eﬀects can be
well controlled by appropriately tuning the experimental parameters such as the Ioﬀe ﬁeld strength and the detuning.

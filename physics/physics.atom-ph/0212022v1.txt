Photoassociation spectroscopy experiments on 40Ca atoms close to the dissociation limit
4s4s1S0−4s4p1P1 are presented. The vibronic spectrum was measured for detunings of the photoas-
sociation laser ranging from 0.6 GHz to 68 GHz with respect to the atomic resonance. In contrast
to previous measurements the rotational splitting of the vibrational lines was fully resolved. Full
quantum mechanical numerical simulations of the photoassociation spectrum were performed which
allowed us to put constraints on the possible range of the calcium scattering length to between 50 a0
and 300 a0.

INTRODUCTION

In photoassociation spectroscopy experiments within cold ensembles of atoms a bound molecule is formed under
the inﬂuence of light. Such measurements can yield information about many atomic properties such as excited states
lifetimes, ground state scattering lengths and long range potentials. Most of the experiments are performed with
alkaline elements. However, due to their atomic ﬁne and hyperﬁne structure theoretical calculations are in general
very complicated to perform for these elements. In contrast, the most abundant isotopes of the alkaline earth metals
show a non-degenerate ground state with no hyperﬁne splitting. This makes the comparison between experiment
In Fig. 1a a simpliﬁed molecular level scheme is shown for
and theory easier than in the case of alkali metals.
the case of Ca2. The photoassociation connects the ground state asymptote to the molecular state 1Σ+
u . ∆f is
the frequency diﬀerence between the photoassociation laser and the asymptote 1S0 + 4p1P1. Our ﬁrst observations
on photoassociation of Ca [1] were performed with cold ensembles around 3 mK and with short trap lifetimes of
about 50 ms only, which in total leads to a poor signal-to-noise ratio for the trap loss by photoassociation. Only for
the deepest recorded vibrational level at the excited asymptote we were able to observe rotational structure on the
vibrational transition. The line proﬁle and line position were interpreted by the help of assumptions, like an averaged
ﬁxed frequency shift of all transitions by 50 MHz due to 3 mK samples.

Here we will report of a more complete series of measurements under improved conditions, doubling the spectral in-
terval of measured photoassociation lines, giving clear rotational structure and performing a full line proﬁle simulation
to get the proper shift of the line center due to thermal averaging and the intensity of the association laser.

II. EXPERIMENT

The calcium atoms are cooled and trapped in a magnetooptical trap (MOT) using the strongly allowed transition
at 422.79 nm (Γ = 2.16 · 108 s−1, see the level scheme in Fig. 1b). An overview of the experimental setup is shown
in Fig. 2. The 423 nm radiation is generated by frequency doubling about 160 mW of a master-slave diode laser
combination with a KNbO3 crystal inside an enhancement cavity. The output power at 423 nm is 36 mW with a
linewidth of 300 kHz. A separate thermal Ca beam is used to keep the absolute frequency in resonance with the
atomic transition. The MOT consists of three mutually orthogonal retroreﬂected beams with diameter of 10 mm and
a power of 5 mW in each beam. The frequency of the trapping laser is red detuned by 29 MHz with respect to the
resonance. The atoms are directly captured from the low velocity tail of the Boltzmann distribution of a thermal
atomic beam. The magnetic ﬁeld gradient generated by a pair of anti Helmholtz coils is 9·10−3 T/cm. A repump laser
at 672 nm is used to prevent trap losses via the 1D1 state, thereby increasing the density of the atomic ensemble by a
factor of four. Absorption imaging of the cloud on the cooling transition was used to determine the radius r and the
density n0 of the trapped ensemble leading to typical values of r = 0.3 mm and n0 = 2 · 1010 cm−3. The temperature
of the ensemble was deduced independently from the ballistic expansion of the cloud and from the Doppler width of
the excitation spectrum on the narrow 1S0 − 3P1 intercombination line (Γ = 2000 s−1), yielding 2 mK < T < 3 mK.
With the repump laser turned on the lifetime of the trap is around 300 ms.

The light of the photoassociation laser is generated by a Stilben 3 dye laser pumped by a 3 W Ar+ UV laser.

2

The output power is 100 mW at 423 nm with a linewidth of 1 MHz. The laser is frequency stabilized to a tunable
high ﬁnesse cavity in vacuum. A tunable helium neon laser at 633 nm is stabilized to the same cavity and its
beat frequency with an iodine stabilized helium neon laser is measured. By keeping the beat frequency constant
the frequency of the photoassociation laser can be held ﬁxed with an accuracy of ±2 MHz. Furthermore, with this
scheme it is possible to scan the frequency of the photoassociation laser by approx. 1.5 GHz with the same accuracy.
The detuning ∆f = fCa − fLaser of the photoassociation laser with respect to the atomic resonance 1S0 − 1P1 was
determined by measuring its beat frequency with the frequency stabilized trapping laser for detunings up to 20 GHz.
For larger detunings the frequency of the photoassociation laser is determined by means of a wavemeter which allows
absolute frequency measurements with an accuracy better than 0.2 MHz. With the transition frequency of the atomic
resonance determined the same way the detuning can be calculated.

The rate of photoassociation was measured by recording the increase of trap losses due to photoassociation which
manifest themselves in a reduced trap ﬂuorescence. The state of the photoassociated Ca dimer may undergo a state
change to a molecular state dissociating into atoms which are no longer trapped (state changing collision), or the
dissociative decay of the dimer may lead to a gain in kinetic energy high enough to allow the atoms of the pair to escape
from the trap (radiative escape). The photoassociation laser was switched on and oﬀ by means of an acousto optical
modulator (AOM) for time intervals of 500 ms which must be considerably larger than the trap lifetime of 300 ms
to allow the trap to reach a new steady state. The intensity of the photoassociation laser was around 400 mW/cm2.
Before and after each interaction period with the photoassociation laser the 423 nm trap ﬂuorescence was detected
by an avalanche photodiode. The collisional loss fraction is the ratio of the reduced signal due to photoassociation
and the signal obtained without photoassociation. The trapping laser itself stayed on during the whole time. Due
to intensity ﬂuctuations of the trap ﬂuorescence of 1 % to 2 % averaging is done over at least 30 s to increase the
signal-to-noise ratio. The collisional loss fraction is directly proportional to the atomic density of the ensemble and,
as long as saturation eﬀects can be neglected, proportional to the intensity of the photoassociation laser.

We measured the collisional trap loss for detunings of the photoassociation laser ranging from 0.6 GHz to 68 GHz
below the atomic 1S0 − 1P1 transition. If counting the vibrational levels v′ from the asymptote starting at v′ = 1
this frequency interval corresponds to 34 ≤ v′ ≤ 72. To smaller v′ we were limited by the resonant interaction of
the photoassociation beam with single atoms, pushing them out of the trap by radiation pressure. For higher v′ the
measurements were limited by decreasing signal strength.

III. THEORETICAL DESCRIPTION

The theoretical description of photoassociation spectra consists of two parts: the precise determination of the
bound states close to the dissociation limit and the modelling of bound-free transition together with its detection by
trap loss. To describe the asymptotic level structure for a diatomic molecule like Ca2 we use the accumulated phase
approximation which was described by VerHaar et al [2]. The potential is given by the long range branch according to
the atomic states at the asymptote. For Ca2 at the excited asymptote 1S0+1P1 the long range behaviour is dominated
by the resonant dipole-dipole interaction and the centrifugal potential term for the rotational state J which should
have the correct behaviour for dissociating into an atom pair with non-vanishing atomic angular momentum; for the
molecular state 1Σ+

u it becomes:

U (R) = D −

C3
R3 +

~2[J(J + 1) + 2]
2µR2

(1)

Here D is the asymptotic atom pair energy and C3 is the dipole-dipole interaction constant which can be calculated
from the transition moment of the 1S0 → 1P1 transition with frequency ωa or from the natural linewidth γa (all
3 for the molecular state 1Σ+
linewidths in this paper are in energy units) of this transition, giving C3 = 3c3γa/2ωa
u ,
and µ is the reduced mass of the molecule. Because of applying only the potential branch at large internuclear
separations we replace the left boundary condition (small R) for a bound state by a ﬁxed phase which accumulates
from small internuclear separation up to a large R, say R0, which is still small enough compared to the classical outer
turning point of the desired bound level. If the binding energy of asymptotic states is small compared to the kinetic
energy for the vibrational motion around the minimum of the potential the accumulated phase up to R0 is a very
weakly varying function for all such asymptotic levels. Thus a ﬁt of observed levels measured with respect to D can
be performed with the above potential branch and a simple power expansion of the phase with the binding energy as
expansion coeﬃcient. It is numerically easier to choose a weak variation of R0 for a constant phase, where in our case
we programmed a maximum of the wave function at the slowly varying R0.

For modelling the photoassociation proﬁle we apply the theory developed by Bohn and Julienne [3]. The coupling
of the continuum at the ground state asymptote 1S0+1S0 by the laser ﬁeld to the excited asymptote 1S0+1P1 leads

to an excitation rate Γ and an energy shift E1 of the transition. The above paper shows that the trap loss probability
by photoassociation for a collision pair with a kinetic energy ε can be written in the following form:

|S0l|2 =

(γs + γr)Γ
[ε − (∆ − E1)]2 + ( γs+γr+γts+Γ

)2

2

S0l is the scattering matrix element of the process of two colliding atoms on the ground state via the bound intermediate
state by the light ﬁeld to the loss state l. γs and γr are the rates for state changing collisions and the radiative escape,
respectively. γts is the molecular spontaneous decay back to trapped states. ∆ represents the detuning between the
excited molecular bound state with energy Eb(v, J) and the laser frequency with respect to the ground state asymptote:
∆ = Eb − ~ωL (see Fig. 3). ∆ must not be confused with ∆f which gives the detuning of the photoassociation laser
(see Fig. 1a). In the theoretical description we will count the vibrational levels v from the bottom of the potential
well. With vD as the non-integer vibrational ‘quantum number’ derived from the vibrational phase of the hypothetical
state exactly at the asymptote one gets the relation v = vD − (vD modulo 1) − v′ + 1. Γ and E1 can be evaluated
in the reﬂection approximation, where the scattering wave function of the ground state potential for the scattering
energy ε is only needed at the Condon point of the transition, the above mentioned paper gives the results:

.

Here the derivative of Eb with respect to v gives the vibrational spacing around the considered bound state, and f0
and g0 are the regular and irregular solution of the scattering function for kinetic energy ε. RC is the Condon point
of the potentials interacting by the laser ﬁeld at the detuning ∆. DC is the potential gradient of the excited state
at the Condon point, the contribution from the ground state potential plays no rule at large internuclear separation
considered in the present case, because this behaves like 1/R6 compared to 1/R3 for the excited state. V0b is the laser
interaction which is calculated with the help of the laser intensity I, the atomic natural width γa and the molecular
enhancement factor fmol which is determined by the molecular symmetry 1Σ+
g of the transition and is to

For the simulations of photoassociation proﬁles, especially for the comparison of relative intensities between diﬀerent
vibrational states, one needs a reliable estimate of γs and γr at least the relative function with vibrational states.
The losses can be either state changing collisions or radiative escape processes, for both we need an inward motion
of the photoassociated state. Thus an estimate of the relative probability of the loss will be the vibrational period of
the state if one assumes that each crossing of the inner region of the potential leads to an equal amount of loss. The
vibrational period can be estimated from the LeRoy-Bernstein formula [5] for bound states close to the asymptote:
Eb = D − X(vD − v)i where X is a constant depending on Cn of the long range behaviour and the reduced mass of
the molecule. In the case of the dipole-dipole asymptote C3 is involved and i becomes 6. With this approximation the
loss rate γs + γr becomes proportional to 6X(vD − v)5; this value was introduced into the simulations of the proﬁles.
For calculating the eigenenergies with the accumulated phase approximation and the scattering wave function the
conventional Numerov method was applied with suﬃciently small integration steps, which was always checked by
numerical convergence.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

4

Figure 4 shows the trap loss spectrum for the vibrational levels v′ = 69 and 72 of the 1Σ+

u state at a detuning
∆f of the photoassociation laser around 52 GHz and 68 GHz from the atomic resonance. Three rotational lines
corresponding to J = 1, 3 and 5 are observed. The sample temperature is about 2 mK, at which the collisional partial
waves with ℓ ≥ 6 have too low probability for leading to an observable signal of level J = 7 of the excited state.
The solid curve shows a simulated spectrum. It is obtained by starting with a potential that is known, e.g., from our
earlier spectroscopic measurements [1], from which the eigenenergies of the rovibrational levels are calculated with the
accumulated phase method. These do not necessarily coincide with the positions of the vibrational levels as measured
in the experiments due to the ﬁnite temperature, AC Stark shifts and the potential itself. The position of rotational
levels with J values of 3 and 5 are shifted up to 120 MHz by these eﬀects. The shift between the observed spectrum and
the simulated one is used in an iteration procedure to modify the potential described by C3 and the power expansion
of R0. After two to three iterations convergence is achieved. The procedure gives a C3 = 0.5217(45) · 103 nm3 · cm−1
resulting in an atomic decay rate of γa/~ = 2.150(19) · 108 s−1. This value is smaller than that reported in [1] by three
times the error limit. This can be explained by the fact that in [1] shifts of the line positions due to temperature have
only been accounted for by a global shift of all frequencies of 50 MHz. From our new calculations presented here this
is not justiﬁed and thus leads to a diﬀerent value. It was also checked that the retardation eﬀect of the dipole-dipole
interaction [4] must be included in the ﬁt. Especially, the levels close to the asymptote 1S0+1P1 for v′ < 40 otherwise
show non-negligible deviations.

It turns out that the relative height of the components of the rotational substructure depends signiﬁcantly on the
value of the scattering length for the ground state potential. For varying the scattering length in test calculations,
one may change the potential slightly at the repulsive branch at small R or around the minimum of the potential.
The result are slight shifts of the last bound levels not only for ℓ = 0 but also for ℓ 6= 0. Here for ℓ = 2 the position
of the corresponding shape resonance moves to the asymptote for decreasing scattering length, which results in the
variation of the intensity ratio of the peaks for J = 1 and 3. Fig. 5 shows the numerical simulation of the vibrational
level v′ = 69 for three diﬀerent scattering lengths of 52.4 a0, 85.2 a0 and 324 a0, respectively, with the Bohr radius
a0 = 0.0529 . . . nm. For clarity the curves are shifted in the vertical direction. The ratio of the J = 1 and J = 3
components and the deepness of the dip between the two components of all measured vibrational lines with resolved
rotational substructure (v′ ≥ 62) are best reproduced by the potential with a scattering length of 85.2 a0. The quite
diﬀerent form of the two other curves (52.4 a0 and 324 a0) suggests that the scattering length lies somewhere between
50 a0 and 300 a0. This is the same order of magnitude of the scattering length as determined by other spectroscopic
methods [6].

In our previous photoassociation experiments on 40Ca [1] it was not possible to determine the relative intensities of
the vibrational lines. This was mainly due to the short trap lifetime of 50 ms which leads to maximum collisional trap
loss fractions of 1 %. In the experiment reported here, the collisional loss fraction at the center of each vibrational
line was measured (Fig. 6). For vibrational lines where the rotational structure is not resolved the collisional loss
fraction at the expected maximum of the resonance line was determined (full circles). For large v′ the rotational
structure is suﬃciently resolved and the collisional loss fraction was measured at the position of the J = 1 (full
triangles) and the J = 3 rotational lines (open triangles). The collisional loss fraction with the photoassociation laser
tuned to the gap between two vibrational lines is shown by open circles. For v′ < 47 the vibrational lines begin to
overlap and the collisional loss fraction does not drop to zero between two lines. Before and after each measurement
session of approximately ten hours the atomic density was determined by taking absorption images on the cooling
transition. Due to mechanical drifts in the setup the density decreased over this period of time by up to 20 %. A
linear variation of the atomic density with time was taken into account to normalize the collisional loss fraction to a
density of 2 · 1010 cm−3. In addition the change in the intensity of the photoassociation laser that showed ﬂuctuations
of approx. 10 % during a scan was corrected. From the measured variation of collisional trap losses with the intensity
of the photoassociation laser (Fig. 7) the ﬂuctuations were corrected to an intensity of 280 mW/cm2.

The curves in Fig. 6 depict the intensity variation of the trap loss as a function of the vibrational quantum number
v′ as expected from theory where the functional form of the trap loss in its vibrational dependence is simpliﬁed being
proportional to (vD − v)5 from the local vibrational spacing. This approach does not distinguish the contribution by
state changing collisions from those by radiative escape. Thus at least a two-parameter ansatz would be necessary
for which a functional model does not exist in the literature for describing the vibrational dependence. We were
experimenting with diﬀerent exponents for (vD − v) instead of 5 and with adding a constant to the loss rate as a
second parameter which could model the diﬀerent weights of the two mechanisms. Such an approach gives a nicer
looking graph for the comparison between experiment and theory but not a convincing deeper physical insight. Thus
we suppressed it, but we would prefer to indicate clearly with Fig. 6 the status of our present understanding.

FIG. 1: Excerpt from the Ca molecular (a) and atomic (b) level scheme. The transition around λ = 423 nm is used for cooling
and photoassociation. A repump laser (λ = 672 nm) prevents decay into metastable triplet levels via the 1D2 state. The long
range part of the 1Σ+
u molecular potential is probed in the experiment. The potential energies as a function of the internuclear
distance R are indicated schematically. ∆f is the frequency diﬀerence between the photoassociation laser and the atomic
resonance.

V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, photoassociation measurements on cold calcium atoms for an extended range of detunings of the
photoassociation laser ranging from 0.6 GHz to 68 GHz below the asymptote were performed and compared with
full line proﬁle simulations. We ﬁnd good agreement between the observed and calculated spectra. The observed
intensity ratio of J = 1 and J = 3 resonances determines the range of the ground state scattering length between
50 a0 and 300 a0 taking the long range behaviour as determined by spectroscopic experiments [6] or by theoretical
predictions [7]. The measured relative intensities of the vibrational transitions are not well explained. New studies of
loss mechanisms are needed or better electronic structure calculations on Ca2 would be desirable to improve on the
model calculations which were published by Machholm et al. [4].

Up to now we only observed the creation of calcium dimers in the 1Σ+

u state. Besides this, the formation of atom
pairs in the 1Πg state is allowed due to retardation. Those vibrational levels should show up as very sharp features
(a few MHz width) in the spectra [4]. It may be possible to get signatures from these states in the experiment when
switching to ultracold calcium atoms with a temperature of a few microkelvin.

Abstract

Recurrence relations of perturbation theory for hydrogen ground state are obtained. With their
aid polarizabilities in constant perpendicular electric and magnetic ﬁelds are computed up to 80th
order. The high orders asymptotic is compared with its quasiclassical estimate. For the case of
arbitrary mutual orientation of external ﬁelds a general sixth order formula is given.

1. Introduction

The hydrogen atom in constant homogeneous electric and magnetic ﬁelds still remains to be
an object of theoretical investigations. A good example is the recent work [1], where a recurrent
nonperturbative method is developed for building the exact wave function of hydrogen atom in
magnetic ﬁeld in the form of convergent double series. More wide discussion of the problem is
contained in the review [2].

The famous technical trouble, namely the inability to separate the variables, only stimulate
application of new investigation methods, including perturbative ones. The moment method [3],
ﬁrst used for perturbative treatment of the anharmonic oscillator, is not related with variables
separation. The recent application of this method to the Zeeman eﬀect problem [4] allowed to check
the behavior of high orders asymptotic of the perturbation series. The moment method in the
form similar to that used in [4], was developed independently of Ader’s work [3] by Fernandez and
Castro [5]. Then it was applied to hydrogen atom placed in parallel electric and magnetic ﬁelds [6]
and later the Zeeman eﬀect problem was considered for four sequences of hydrogen atom states [7].
It seems to be even more important to apply it to hydrogen atom in crossed electric ( ~E) and
magnetic ( ~H) ﬁelds because only initial terms of expansion in powers of ~E and ~H were considered
for this case up to now [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. As will be shown here the moment method allows to
compute high enough orders of this expansion.

The high orders asymptotic can be obtained with the help of the imaginary time method [13, 14,
15]. This asymptotic is determined by the contribution of an extreme subbarrier classical trajectory
into the atom ionization probability [16, 17]. A pair of extreme paths replaces this trajectory at
some value of the ratio of external ﬁelds γ = H/E. The dependence of far perturbation series terms
on γ reﬂects this change of extreme trajectory and should be especially sharp for perpendicular
external ﬁelds. We study here just this case.

2. Recurrent evaluation of perturbation series

Consider the ground state of hydrogen atom, placed in perpendicular electric and magnetic
ﬁelds. These ﬁelds are supposed to be constant and homogeneous. We restrict ourselves with
nonrelativistic approximation and neglect the spin of electron. From the very beginning we take
measures to simplify the numerical computations and to achieve high enough order of perturbation
theory. For this aim we consider γ as a ﬁxed parameter, replacing the double expansion in external
ﬁelds by the single-variable series

An expression for hyper-polarizability arises from eq. (5) at σ = α = β = 0 and even k

The closed system of recurrence relations (5) – (7) allows to achieve, at least in principle, an arbitrary
high order of perturbation theory. The sequence of operations is similar (also somewhat simpler)
to that, used in the work [4] to compute Zeeman’s shift of a non-degenerate state. At every order k
only moments P k
σαβ from the sector σ ≥ α + β − 1, α ≥ 0, β ≥ 0 are necessary. They are evaluated
by successively increasing of σ, α and β values with the help of eq. (5).

We have obtained hyper-polarizabilities in perpendicular ﬁelds up to 80th order, see table 1.
This order is large enough to compare the dependence of these coeﬃcients on γ, see ﬁg. 1, with the
predictions, following from quasiclassical considerations. One can see from ﬁg. 1, that the function

As follows from table 1, at not very large γ values all E⊥

the case of Stark eﬀect. In intermediate region of γ values the sequence of E⊥
for suﬃciently large γ’s the series has normal Zeeman’s sequence of signs (−1)j+1.

2j coeﬃcients have negative sign, as in
2j signs is irregular and

3. High orders asymptotic

As is well known [16], a dispersion relation connects asymptotic of high orders coeﬃcients E⊥
k
with the ionization probability of the atom i.e. with the penetrability of the potential barrier. This
relation arises as a consequence of the fact, that the energy eigenvalue E = E0(E 2) − i
2 Γ(E 2) has
essential singularity at E 2 = 0 and a cut along E 2 > 0 semiaxis. (And similarly E(H2) has essential
singularity at H = 0 and a cut H2 < 0.)

To evaluate the ionization probability Γ the imaginary time method was previously developed [13,
14, 15]. The leading term of the asymptotic ˜E⊥
k of E⊥
k coeﬃcients at k → ∞ is determined by the
classical subbarrier path with extremal value of the abbreviated action. Time takes complex values
during this subbarier motion. There are two kinds of complex classical trajectories. Like in the Stark
eﬀect case, the ionization may be caused by electric ﬁeld, at stabilizing inﬂuence of the magnetic
ﬁeld. The path of this kind creates the asymptotic

˜E⊥

k (γ) ∼ k! ak(γ) ,

k is even ,

(8)

at not very large magnetic ﬁeld, for γ below some critical value γc. According to [18] γc = 3.54
for perpendicular external ﬁelds. And it is possible to cross the barrier also at H2 < 0, like in the
Zeeman eﬀect problem. Subbarrier trajectories of this kind are responsible for the form of ˜E⊥
k (γ)
in the opposite case γ > γc. This change of asymptotic explains the origin of the left minimum in
ﬁg. 1.

Having in mind to get estimate for the function a(γ), entering ˜E⊥

k , we apply the results of [18, 19]
and write here some necessary expressions for the special case of perpendicular external ﬁelds. More
general considerations related to arbitrary ~E and ~H mutual orientation are contained in the work [18].

The time of subbarrier motion satisﬁes the equation [19]:

τ 2 − (τ cthτ − 1)2 = γ2

which has a set of solutions τn = inπ+τ ′
n. The minimal value of the imaginary part of the subbarrier
action is provided by τ0 for γ < γc and by a pair of solutions τ±1 for γ > γc. In the region γ < γc
the energy half-width is

The last equality is valid also in the region γ > γc, where g(γ) and a(γ) are complex functions. At

On the other hand in the limit of large k a simple relation appropriate for numerical evaluation
holds:

Evaluating a(γ) above γc, we used smoothed function E⊥
k (γ), with the nodes vicinities excluded. A
comparison of this way numerically obtained function a(γ) with expressions (13) – (15) is presented
in ﬁg. 2.

Now we turn our attention to the region γ > γc. Two solutions of eq. (9) τ1 and τ−1 lead to
complex conjugate values of g(γ). Substituting approximate τ1 value into second expression (10),
it is possible to get the phase of the function a(γ):

arg (a) = −arg (g) = −

α(γ) =

Here β(γ) = arg (B) is the phase of the preexponential factor. Its relative contribution to the total
phase falls like 1/j.

When the order of perturbation 2j is ﬁxed and γ increases, expression (17) changes its sign at
every point where the argument of the sinus turns to zero. This could explain the singular points
in ﬁg. 1 in the language of asymptotic. But rather lengthy calculations are required to establish
detailed quantitative correspondence between asymptotic (17) and exact E⊥
2j coeﬃcients, including
nodes vicinities. Simple approximate expression for α(γ) is not enough for this aim.

For the general case of the ground state energy expansion in powers of crossed external ﬁelds,

the term of the forth power was known long enough [9].

The value of E(4) is conﬁrmed for perpendicular ﬁelds by the work [12] and for parallel ﬁelds –
by [12, 17, 20]. The E⊥
4 coeﬃcient, computed by means of recurrence relations (5) – (7) exactly agree
with (19). But we have noticed numerical diﬀerence between our coeﬃcient E⊥
6 and corresponding
quantity from the work [12]. Therefore the sixth order of perturbation theory was analyzed in
details.

The magneto-electric susceptibilities, i.e. coeﬃcients of the double series in powers of external
ﬁelds, can be easily obtained from hyper-polarizabilities E⊥
k (γ). Thus, in the sixth order, taking
into account that Stark’s and Zeeman’s coeﬃcients are ﬁxed, it is enough to choose four diﬀerent γ
values and to solve the system of four linear equations. The following representation results

(The last identity introduces notation of [12].) Using linear relation between expansions (1) and (18)
and the known magneto-electric susceptibilities in parallel ﬁelds [20], it is easy to obtain another
term of series (18):

Some next terms of series (18) can be obtained in the same way. Expressions (20) and (21) are

5. Concluding remarks

The considered above problem demonstrates once more the high eﬃciency and convenience of
the moment method. The obtained recurrence relations have allowed to advance up to 80th order of
perturbation theory. Besides the unusual ”oscillations” of hyper-polarizabilities as a function of the
ratio of external ﬁelds were noticed. The high orders asymptotical behavior was analyzed as well.
Basic parameters of this asymptotic exactly agree with those, previously obtained on the ground of
quasiclassical approximation with the help of imaginary time method.

Appendix

Extending the described in the work [9] calculations we obtained, by the same method, the
ground state energy correction, which is proportional to Q ≡ H2[ ~H ~E]2. The perturbation in [9]
includes Stark’s term Vs = ~E~r, paramagnetic Vp = 1
8[ ~H~r]2 terms.

Fig. 1.

Functions fk(γ) = ln

resulting from the recurrently computed hyper-

polarizabilities.

Fig. 2. Parameter a(γ) of the perturbation series asymptotic.

The solid line follows from the quasiclassical estimate at γ ≪ 1, see eq. (13); the same estimate for
γ ≫ 1 is presented by dashed lines, see eqs. (14) and (15). Numerically obtained values are denoted
by stars.

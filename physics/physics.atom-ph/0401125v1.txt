Abstract

New results are presented for Ps(1s) scattering by H(1s), He(11S) and Li(2s). Cal-
culations have been performed in a coupled state framework, usually employing
pseudostates, and allowing for excitation of both the Ps and the atom. In the Ps(1s)-
H(1s) calculations the H− formation channel has also been included using a highly
accurate H− wave function. Resonances resulting from unstable states in which the
positron orbits H− have been calculated and analysed. The new Ps(1s)-He(11S) cal-
culations still fail to resolve existing discrepancies between theory and experiment
at very low energies. The possible importance of the Ps− formation channel in all
three collision systems is discussed.

Key words: positronium, scattering, close coupling, pseudostates, atomic

1 Introduction

In this article we present some new theoretical results for positronium(Ps)-
atom scattering for three fundamental systems: Ps-H, Ps-He and Ps-alkali
metal, taking Li as our example of an alkali metal. In each case we assume
that the incident Ps and the target atom are both in their ground states.
Throughout we use atomic units (au) in which ~ = me = e = 1, the symbol a0
is used to denote the Bohr radius, a0 = ~2/me2. To express energies derived in
atomic units, eg, the calculated position and width of a resonance, in electron
volts(eV) we have used the conversion 1 au=27.21138344(106) eV [1].

Fig. 1. Event line for Ps(1s)-H(1s) scattering in the electronic spin singlet state.
Events are shown as a function of the impact energy E(in eV). The diagram is
purely schematic and not to scale.

Fig. 1 shows an event line for this system. In a non-relativistic treatment of Ps-
H collisions the total electronic spin, Se, is conserved. Since the system contains
two electrons the possible values of Se are 0 and 1. Fig. 1 illustrates the case
of scattering in the electronic spin singlet state Se = 0. From Fig. 1 we see
that the system possesses a single S-wave bound state [2], positronium hydride
(PsH), with a binding energy of 1.0666 eV [3]. As far as scattering is concerned,
the signiﬁcance of this bound state is that it corresponds mathematically to
a pole at an impact energy of -1.0666 eV in the S-wave singlet scattering
amplitude. As we approach zero impact energy the singlet elastic cross section,
which becomes increasingly S-wave, rises towards the pole, see Fig. 2. The
precise value of the zero energy singlet cross section in a calculation therefore
depends upon how well this pole is represented.

Up until 5.1 eV only elastic Ps(1s)-H(1s) scattering is possible. At 5.1 eV
Ps(n=2) excitation becomes feasible, the atom still remaining in its ground
state. At 6.0470 eV Ps(n=3) excitation comes on line. Interestingly, this thresh-
old is almost coincident with that for H− formation (Ps + H =⇒ H− + e+)
at 6.0477 eV [4]. In quoting these numbers we have ignored relativistic eﬀects
and have assumed that the proton has inﬁnite mass. One wonders whether
this near degeneracy might present some interesting experimental opportuni-
ties. Certainly, it should lead to a competition between the two channels and
since, as we shall see later (Fig. 3), there is a rich Rydberg resonance struc-
ture associated with the H− threshold, it presumably has some eﬀect upon
this structure.

Between 6.0477 eV and 6.8 eV the full Rydberg spectrum of Ps becomes

2

accessible until, at last, at 6.8 eV the Ps can be ionized. Not until 10.2
eV can the atom be excited, to the n=2 level with the Ps remaining in its
ground state. Ionization of the atom becomes possible at 13.6 eV. However,
forma-
between 10.2 and 13.6 eV another interesting threshold appears, Ps
tion (Ps + H =⇒ Ps
+ p), at 13.28 eV [4]. This threshold lies in the midst
of thresholds for producing highly excited H (in fact between the H(n=6) and
H(n=7) thresholds). As with H− we would expect Rydberg resonance structure
threshold, although probably much less pronounced.

Beyond the energy range of Fig. 1, double excitation of both projectile and
target becomes possible at 15.3 eV and double ionization at 20.4 eV.

Scattering in the electronic spin triplet (Se = 1) channels is somewhat less
interesting, although usually the dominant component of any spin averaged
cross section. The event line for triplet scattering is the same as Fig. 1 except
that the PsH bound state and the H− and Ps− channels are omitted. The
absence of these formation channels means also a corresponding absence of
resonance structure.

2.2 Coupled Pseudostate Calculations

The challenge to theory is to represent the events portrayed in Fig. 1 in an ad-
equate way. A suitable and powerful representation is provided by the coupled
pseudostate approach.

Let rp(ri ) be the position vector of the positron(i th electron) relative to the
proton, which is assumed to be inﬁnitely massive. Ri ≡ (rp + ri)/2 and
ti ≡ (rp − ri ) then correspond to the centre of mass of the Ps relative to the
proton and to the Ps internal coordinate when the Ps consists of the positron
and the i th electron. The non-relativistic Hamiltonian for the Ps-H system is
then

Following previous work [5,6] we expand the collisional wave function, Ψ, for
the system in a particular state of total electronic spin Se according to

where the sum is over Ps states φa and H states ψb. These states may be either
eigenstates or pseudostates and have the property that

< φa(t)|HP s(t)|φa′(t) >= Eaδaa′

< φa(t)|φa′(t) >= δaa′

< ψb(r)|HA(r)|ψb′(r) >= εbδbb′

(5)
Substituting (4) into the Schr¨odinger equation with the Hamiltonian (1) and
projecting with φa(t1)ψb(r2) leads to coupled equations for the functions Gab
of the form

to partial wave form and solved using the R-matrix technique [7].

The approximation (4) has been employed in [6] using 9 Ps states and 9 H
states, called the 9Ps9H approximation, and, for S-wave scattering only, using

14 Ps and 14 H states (14Ps14H approximation). The 9 states are shown in
table 1, a more detailed speciﬁcation is given in [6]. They consist of 1s, 2s, 2p
eigenstates and 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d pseudostates (pseudostates are denoted
by a “bar”). The pseudostates give a representation of the Ps/H continua as
well as giving an average approximation to the bound eigenstates with n ≥ 3
(the n=3 pseudostates of table 1 have approximately a 2/3 overlap with the
n ≥ 3 eigenstate spectrum [8]). While the 9Ps9H and 14Ps14H approximations
should be satisfactory for describing electronic spin triplet scattering, it has
been shown in [9], but only within the context of the frozen target approxima-
tion, that the e+ −H− channel exerts a profound eﬀect upon singlet scattering.
Here we try to improve upon the earier calculations of [6] for singlet scattering
by explicitly adding on the e+ − H− channel, our approximation (4) for singlet
scattering is then extended to

Ψ =

Gab(R1)φa(t1)ψb(r2) + (−1)SeGab(R2)φa(t2)ψb(r1)

where ψ− is the H− wave function. We refer to this as the 9Ps9H + H− or
14Ps14H + H− approximation, etc., depending upon the number of Ps and
H states used in the sum. For ψ− we have used a highly accurate 100 term
Kinoshita-Koga type wave function [10,11] giving an H− binding energy of
0.0277510163 au. It should be noted that the calculation of [9] was restricted
not only by the frozen target approximation but also by the use of an approx-
imate H− wave function, these restrictions have now been lifted in the present
work.

Accurate result of [3]

The ﬁrst test of the approximation (7) is how well it reproduces the PsH
binding energy. Table 2 shows the present and earlier calculations compared
with the very accurate result of [3]. Here we see that the frozen target ap-

5

proximation 9Ps1H gives only half of the binding energy. The allowance for
virtual target excitation in the 9Ps9H and 14Ps14H approximations raises this
to 90-93%. Inclusion of the e+ − H− channel brings further improvement, as
we would expect, but our best result, 14Ps14H + H−, still remains 3.4% be-
low the accurate value of [3]. We estimate that our numerical methods are
good enough to yield an answer correct to better than 1%. The deviation of
3.4% from the accurate result of [3] is therefore signiﬁcant. What is missing?
The approximation (7) should represent satisfactorily correlation in which one
electron is associated primarily with the proton and the other electron with
the positron (the sum in (7)) and in which the two electrons are strongly cor-
related in association with the proton while the positron moves more freely
around this complex (the ψ− term). What is absent is correlation in which
the two electrons and the positron are associated in a strongly correlated unit
moving in the ﬁeld of the proton, in short, a Ps
structure orbiting the proton.
We speculate that the addition of the Ps− + p channel to (7) might lead to
signiﬁcant improvement.

Recent accurate low energy S-wave calculations by Van Reeth and Humber-
ston [12] using the Kohn variational principle present a further opportunity
to test our approximations. In table 3 we make a comparison of our best cal-
culations for the S-wave singlet phase shifts and scattering length with these
accurate numbers. We see that inclusion of the e+ +H− channel roughly halves
the diﬀerence between the 14Ps14H approximation and the variational results
for the phase shifts. With the exception of the last point at 0.7 au, our best
phase shifts, in the 14Ps14H + H− approximation, now diﬀer from the vari-
ational numbers by about 1%. The agreement between the 14Ps14H + H−
scattering length and the variational answer is particularly good.

6

The largest calculation that we have made for higher partial waves is in the
9Ps9H + H− approximation. In table 4 we list the phase shifts in this approx-
imation for S-, P-, D-wave scattering. Comparing tables 3 and 4, we see that
the S-wave phase shifts in the 9Ps9H + H− approximation are only marginally
better than those in the 14Ps14H approximation which does not include the
e+ − H− channel.

Fig. 2 shows S, P, and D electronic spin singlet elastic partial wave cross
sections in the energy range 0 to 3.5 eV. The inadequacy of the frozen target
approximation, 9Ps1H, in this energy range is clear. The large zero energy
9Ps1H S-wave cross section is the result of the small PsH binding energy
obtained in this approximation, see table 2. Consequently, the PsH bound
state pole in the scattering amplitude is much closer to zero impact energy
than it should be, see Fig. 1, with the result that the cross section rises to too
high a value at zero energy. Fig. 2 also illustrates the change in the 9Ps9H
cross sections on including the e+ − H− channel.

Fig. 3 shows the same cross sections in the energy range 3.5 to 6.5 eV. Here
we see pronounced resonance structure associated with unstable states of the
positron trapped in the ﬁeld of the H− ion [13,9]. The 9Ps9H approximation
only gives the ﬁrst of these resonances, and at too high an energy. To see the
profound impact of the full resonance structure one needs the 9Ps9H + H−
approximaton, i.e., one needs to include the e+ + H− channel explicitly in the
approximation.

We have ﬁtted the positions and widths of the ﬁrst few resonances, these
are given in table 5 where comparison is made with the complex coordinate

7

rotation results of Yan and Ho [3,14,15,16]. We see that the ﬁrst member of
each partial wave series in the 9Ps9H+H− approximation lies higher in position
than the complex coordinate prediction. By contrast, the second member lies
lower. Generally speaking, the agreement on positions and widths between the
two theoretical results leaves something to be desired.

scattering in the energy range 0 to 3.5 eV. Approximations: solid curve, 9Ps9H+H−;

By combining the electronic spin triplet results in the 9Ps9H approximation
from [6] with the present electronic spin singlet results in the 9Ps9H + H−
approximation we have calculated the Ps(1s)+H(1s) total cross section in the
energy range 0 to 6.7 eV, ﬁg. 4. This cross section shows the spectacular
eﬀect of the singlet resonance structures. It should be noted that the cross
section of ﬁgure 4 assumes that the target H atom is spin unpolarized and
that no spin analysis is made of the ﬁnal states [6,9]; the cross section is
independent of whether the incident Ps(1s) is ortho or para and, if ortho, of
its spin polarization. Partial waves with total angular momentum J from 0 to
4 have been used in calculating the cross section of ﬁgure 4.

2.3 Conclusions

It is probably fair to say that we now have a pretty good overall idea of Ps(1s)-
H(1s) scattering in the energy range up to 6.7 eV. However, within the context
of the coupled pseudostate approach some details remain to be cleared up—the
PsH binding energy, the exact details of the resonances, better convergence

here are pseudostates rather than eigenstates, see table 1). In addition it would
be interesting to see what resonance structure might be associated with the
Ps

3 Positronium Scattering by Helium (Ps(1s)–He(11S))

In a large frozen target calculation Blackwood et al [17] have highlighted sig-
niﬁcant discrepancies between theory and theory, experiment and experiment,
and theory and experiment for very low energy o-Ps(1s)–He(11S) scattering.
The work on atomic hydrogen [6] (see ﬁgures 2 and 5) illustrates nicely the

deﬁciencies of the frozen target approximation at low energies and the need
to allow for virtual target excitation. Here we report some new coupled pseu-
dostate calculations for He which relax the frozen target assumption. The
generalization of (4) to the case of Ps(1s)–He(11S) scattering is

together to give total spin 1/2, that is the purpose of the Clebsch-Gordan
Coeﬃcient C in (8). Finally, A is the electron antisymmetrization operator.

isation constant. The orbitals ψb(r) are at our disposal to choose as we see
appropriate. The form (9) is the same as that used in the e+−He scattering
calculations of [18]. Using (9) we have constructed 9He states analogous to
the 9H states of table 1 and labelled as 11S, 21S, 21P, 31S, 31P, 31D, 41S, 41P,
41D. As in table 1, the n=3 states are constructed so as to sit at the ionization
threshold of He(11S) at 24.58 eV. The 11S, 21S and 21P states are, of course,
now just approximations to the He(11S), He(21S) and He(21P) eigenstates.

Combining the 9 He states described above with the 9 Ps states from ta-
ble 1 (a 9Ps9He approximation analogous to 9Ps9H) we have calculated an
S-wave Ps(1s)–He(11S) elastic scattering cross section in the energy range 0
to 6.5 eV, ﬁgure 5. Because we encountered some bad numerical behaviour
with the higher partial waves, we have evaluated the P-wave cross section
in a reduced approximation, 7Ps7He, in which the Ps and He d-states have
been dropped. The P-wave cross section is shown in ﬁgure 5. Also included
in ﬁgure 5 are the corresponding frozen target cross sections calculated in the
9Ps1He (S-wave) and 7Ps1He (P-wave) approximations. It has been remarked
that Ps(1s)–He(11S) scattering should be similar to Ps(1s)–H(1s) scattering
in the electronic spin triplet state since in both cases antisymmetry keeps the
positronium electron and the atomic electron(s) apart, consequently we have
added the triplet 9Ps9H and 9Ps1H S- and P-wave cross sections to ﬁgure 5
for comparison. We see a similar pattern for both H and He which gives us
some conﬁdence in our calculations. In each case allowance for virtual target
excitation produces a noticeable reduction on the frozen target results. For
He this eﬀect seems to be smaller than for H, presumably on account of the
higher excitation energies for a He target.

0. This contrasts with our zero energy cross section of 9.9 πa2

Since the original calculations of Blackwood et al [17] three other relevant
pieces of work have appeared in the literature. In [19] Basu et al have in-
cluded both Ps and He excitations in a Ps(1s, 2p)+He(11S, 21S, 21P) coupled
eigenstate calculation. They obtain a zero energy elastic cross section of 7.40
πa2
0 in the much
larger 9Ps9He coupled pseudostate calculation. In [20] Mitroy and Ivanov have
used a model potential approximation which yields values for the zero energy
cross section ranging from 10.6 πa2
0 depending upon the choice of
parameters in the potential. Interestingly, their average cross section of 9.83
πa2
0 agrees well with our present results. Finally, Chiesa et al [21] have em-
ployed the diﬀusion Monte Carlo method to calculate S-wave phase shifts in
the momentum range 0 to 0.4 au. They get a zero energy cross section of 7.89
πa2
0.

0 to 8.8 πa2

In ﬁgure 6 we make a comparison with the low energy experimental data. As

where d σel/d Ω is the elastic diﬀerential cross section and θ is the scatter-
ing angle. At zero impact energy where the scattering is all S-wave σmom is
identical with the S-wave total cross section. However, as pointed out in [22],
σmom can diverge rapidly from the total cross section with increasing energy.
In ﬁgure 6 the theoretical results correspond to the momentum transfer cross
section. The only exception is the cross section of Chiesa et al [21] where we
have only S-wave data and so the cross section shown is just the S-wave total
cross section. The cross section of Basu et al has been constructed out of the
phase shift data given in their paper [19]. Figure 6 shows that our frozen tar-
get approximation agrees well with the experimental point of Nagashima et
al [23]. Our present results are also in agreement with this measurement and
close to, but outside, the error bars of the cross sections of Canter et al [24] and
Ryts¨ol¨a et al [25]. Most striking, however, is the agreement between these two
measurements and the S-wave total cross section of the sophisticated Monte
Carlo calculation of Chiesa et al which, as indicated above, coincides with
the momentum transfer cross section at zero energy. Another striking point
is the lack of agreement between any of the theories and the cross section of
Skalsey et al [26] centred on 0.725 eV. At this energy our calculations and that

13

of Basu et al show that σmom is about 20% smaller than the total cross sec-
tion, indicating the importance of P-wave scattering. To get agreement with
the measurement of Skalsey et al would require a more spectacular growth in
P-wave scattering.

There are a number of ways in which the present calculations can be improved.
Firstly, there is a need to eliminate any doubts concerning the use of an approx-
imation to the He ground state wave function, see (9). Secondly, there is the
question of the importance of He triplet states in the expansion (8). Finally, we
have remarked upon the similarity of Ps(1s)–He(11S) scattering and Ps(1s)–
H(1s) triplet scattering, see ﬁgure 5, but there is one mechanism in Ps(1s)–
He(11S) scattering which is not available to the Ps(1s)–H(1s) triplet case, that
mechanism is Ps− formation (Ps(1s)+He(11S)=⇒Ps−+He+(1s)) [27]. This
might be a more important mechanism than has been realised and may, per-
haps, resolve the discrepancy between theory and the experiment of Skalsey et
al [26]. In addition, this mechanism would be a possible source of resonances
in Ps(1s)–He(11S) scattering although the resonance structure may be small
in magnitude.

4 Positronium Scattering by Lithium ( Ps(1s)–Li(2s))

Alkali metals behave in many respects like a one-electron system in which
the single valence electron revolves outside a frozen core. A priori, one might
therefore think that Ps-alkali scattering would be similar to Ps–H scattering.
That this is not so is suggested by the event line for Ps(1s)–Li(2s) scattering
shown in ﬁgure 7. Compared with ﬁgure 1 for Ps(1s)–H(1s), everything is
“reversed”. Yes, there is a bound state of Ps and Li [28] analogous to PsH,
but with increasing energy it is atom excitation and ionization that preceed
Ps excitation and ionization, the opposite of ﬁgure 1. We also see that the
order of Ps− and Li− formation is reversed compared to that of Ps− and H−
formation shown in ﬁgure 1. Ps− formation presumably therefore plays a much
more prominent role for the alkali systems than for H, and, in particular, with
regard to resonance formation.

An interesting feature which ﬁgure 1 does not possess is a channel corre-
sponding to the formation of a bound state of the positron with the atom,
in ﬁgure 7 the e−+Lie+ channel. The binding energy of positronic lithium, as
Lie+ is called, is very small and the threshold for this channel (at 5.326 eV)
is almost degenerate with that for ionization of the Li atom (at 5.392 eV),
lying only 0.066 eV below [29]. Again, a priori, one would expect Rydberg
resonance structure associated with this channel, but of what amplitude is
hard to predict. Unlike the Ps−+Li+ and e++Li− channels which also promise
Rydberg resonance structure but only in electronic spin singlet scattering, the

positronic lithium channel couples to both electronic spin singlet and elec-
tronic spin triplet scattering.

We are unable at this point to execute an approximation which does justice to
ﬁgure 7. Rather, we have elected for a simple coupled eigenstate approxima-
tion to get a rough feeling of how things might go. Earlier coupled eigenstate
calculations have been published by Ray [30], Biswas [31], and Chakraborty
et al [32], but in all cases either the Ps or the Li atom has been frozen in its
ground state. Here we publish the ﬁrst calculations which allow for excitation
of both the Ps and the Li atom.

Our approximation is Ps(1s, 2s, 2p)+Li(2s, 2p). We have constructed the
Li(2s) and Li(2p) valence orbitals using the model potential of Stein [33].
The collision formulation is the same as that given in equations (1) to (6) of
section 2.2 for Ps–H, except that we also include potentials Vp(rp) and -Ve(ri)
to allow for the interaction of the positron and the electrons with the frozen
1s2 core of the Li atom [34]. Our approximation contains a representation
of the van der Waals interaction, -C6/R6, with C6=288 au. In a much larger
calculation of C6 using pseudostates for the Ps but keeping just the Li(2s) and
Li(2p) states, we get C6=451 au. The present coupled eigenstate calculation
therefore includes about 60% of the full van der Waals eﬀect. For Ps(1s)–H(1s),
C6=34.8 au [6]. The van der Waals force is therefore an order of magnitude
stronger for Ps interacting with Li. Our approximation gives a PsLi bound
state with binding energy 0.224 eV, somewhat less than 0.336 eV, the most
accurate calculated value [28].

Figure 8 shows our calculated total cross section and its components. We have
assumed that the Li atom is spin unpolarized and that ﬁnal state spins are not
resolved, the cross section is then 1/4 times singlet plus 3/4 times triplet [6].

scattering by Li(2s) as

for Ps(1s)

Our results apply either for o–Ps or p–Ps scattering and are independent of
any spin polarization of the o–Ps [6]. From ﬁgure 8 we see that at very low
energies we can expect an elastic cross section of the order of 100 πa2
0, the spin
singlet component of this cross section is much larger as a result of the small
binding energy of the PsLi pole in the singlet scattering amplitude. To get the
zero energy cross section right is going to require an approximation with an
accurate representation of the PsLi binding. Away from threshold the elastic
cross section falls rapidly but then, with the opening of the Li(2p) channel
at 1.85 eV (ﬁgure 7), it experiences a sudden rise resulting in a pronounced
structure. The Ps(1s)+Li(2s)=⇒Ps(1s)+Li(2p) cross section increases rapidly
from threshold, reaches a maximum of 17 πa2
0 at 2.1 eV, then quickly turns
over and, comparatively speaking, is negligible beyond 10 eV. Beyond 8 eV
the Ps(1s)+Li(2s)=⇒Ps(n=2)+Li(2s) cross section is dominant. The opening
of this channel leads to structure in the other open channels near 5.1 eV. By
50 eV the double excitation cross section Ps(1s)+Li(2s)=⇒Ps(n=2)+Li(2p)
has risen to meet the Ps(n=2)+Li(2s) curve. The importance of double exci-
tation at high energies is not surprising [35]. Our model predicts that Ps(n=2)
excitation, irrespective of the ﬁnal state of the Li atom, will be dominant at
high energies. However, we should not accept that, in reality, this will be so.
We suspect that, in a more realistic treatment allowing for ionization of the
Ps, it will, as in other cases [5,6,17,22], be Ps ionization which is dominant
at high energies with Ps(n=2) discrete excitation being much less signiﬁcant.
The problem is that, in the present model, there is nowhere for Ps excitation
to go but into the Ps(n=2) channels. Ps excitation which otherwise would ﬂow
into ionization is possibly being deﬂected into the Ps(n=2) channels. Clearly

16

a more detailed calculation is required.

5 Conclusions

We have presented new coupled state calculations for Ps(1s) scattering by
H(1s) in the electronic spin singlet state, by He(11S) at very low energies, and
by Li(2s). One interesting theme that emerges from all three cases is the ques-
tion of the importance of Ps− formation, whether real or virtual. For Ps(1s)-
H(1s) scattering we speculate that the inclusion of virtual Ps− formation may
be necessary to tune the calculations into agreement with the accurate vari-
ational results of Van Reeth and Humberston [12] and with accurate bound
state calculations of PsH binding [3]. For Ps(1s)-He(11S) scattering, virtual
Ps− formation in the reaction Ps(1s)+He(11S)=⇒Ps−+He+(1s) provides us
with a mechanism for breaking away from the pattern of Ps(1s)-H(1s) triplet
scattering which present coupled state calculations on He seem to follow, and
perhaps a route to agreement with the seemingly anomalous experimental re-
sult of Skalsey et al [26], ﬁgure 6. For Ps(1s) scattering by Li(2s), or indeed
any alkali, we have, because of the energetics, the very interesting possibility
that Ps− formation, both real and virtual, may play a much more profound
role than had ever been envisaged. Clearly the study of Ps− formation is an
important direction for future research.

For Ps(1s)-H(1s) scattering another interesting feature which so far has not
been properly treated, is the near degeneracy of the Ps(n=3) excitation chan-
nels and the H− formation channel, this must surely have some signiﬁcant ef-
fect on the resonance structure associated with the H− threshold. For Ps(1s)-
He(11S) scattering there is a need to know about sensitivity to the use of
approximate He(11S) target wave functions, as well as the role of He triplet
states in the collisional wave function expansion (8). For Ps(1s)–alkali scatter-
ing most of the really interesting physics would seem to lie at impact energies
below 10 eV, which is a challenge to experimentalists. The challenge to theory
in this case is to represent the Ps− and alkali negative ion channels, and to a
lesser extent the positronic lithium channel, as well as the Ps and alkali atom
channels. Without an adequate description of the ion channels it is unlikely
that an accurate calculation of resonances can be made [31]. Also, because
of the small binding energies of Ps-alkali bound states [28] and their role as
poles in the scattering amplitude, near threshold electronic spin singlet cross
sections for Ps(1s)-alkali scattering will be very large and very sensitive to the
pole position. Consequently, any realistic treatment of Ps(1s)-alkali scattering
at low energies will need to incorporate a reasonably accurate representation
of the Ps-alkali bound state.

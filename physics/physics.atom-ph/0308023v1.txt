We study the continuous limit of a multibox Erhenfest urn model proposed before by the authors.
The evolution of the resulting continuous system is governed by a diﬀerential equation, which de-
scribes a diﬀusion process on a circle with a nonzero drifting velocity. The short time behavior of
this diﬀusion process is obtained directly by solving the equation, while the long time behavior is
derived using the Poisson summation formula. They reproduce the previous results in the large M
(number of boxes) limit. We also discuss the connection between this diﬀusion equation and the
Schr¨odinger equation of some quantum mechanical problems.

PACS numbers: 05.30.-d

In a previous study [1] we proposed a generalized
Ehrenfest urn model [2] with N balls and M urns that ar-
ranged periodically along a circle. The evolution of the
system is governed by a directed stochastic operation.
Using the standard matrix diagonalization procedures to-
gether with a multi-variable generating function method,
we have solved the problem completely. We found that
for a generic M > 2 case the average number of balls
in a certain urn oscillates several times before it reaches
a stationary value. We also obtained the Poincar´e cycle
[3], i.e., the average time interval required for the system
to return to its initial conﬁguration. The result is sim-
ply given by M N , which indicates that the fundamental
assumption of statistical mechanics holds in this system.
Taking M = 2, our model reproduces all the results of
the original Erhenfest urn model [2].

In this paper, we further study the continuous limit
(the large M and N limit) of the proposed multiurn
model. We show that by deﬁning a density function ρ
as the continuous limit of the fraction fi =
/N , i.e.,
the average number of balls in the ith urn devided by
N , the continuous limit of the model exists if we also
deﬁne the drifting velocity and diﬀusion constant appro-
priately. The evolution of ρ in spacetime is then governed
by a diﬀerential equation, which can be solved under
proper initial condition and boundary conditions. The
results obtained in this paper are in agreement with those
obtained before by the standard matrix diagonalization
method. Since for even a generic M -urn and N -ball case
the Poincar’e cycle M N is too huge to be experienced,
the evolution of the system can in practice be treated as
unrepeatable, thus the average quantities considered here
become more important than those of microstate details.

We start from the Eq. (4) of Ref.[1]:

It is clear that Eq. (4) is a diﬀusion equation. Since the
model is deﬁned on a circle, we replace x by φ, v by ω,
∆x by θ, and the diﬀusion equation becomes

Before further exploring Eq.(6), here we give a simple
and general derivation of the diﬀusion equation. Note

which is the desired diﬀusion equation and has the same

On a circle, Eq. (10) becomes Eq. (6), with boundary

Now we ﬁnd the solutions ρ for the 1D diﬀusion equa-
tions on a straight line (4) and on a circle (6), respec-
tively. Assuming the initially condition:

ρ(x, 0) = δ(x),

(13)

for the cases M = 30 and M = 60. As one can see, they
indeed reproduce the results of Ref.
[1] in the large M
limit. The parameter N does not appear here because
the motion of each particle is independent in our model.
Note that although for a small t the expression (16)
is good enough to be a fast convergent series, however,
when t becomes large, Eq. (16) converges slowly. In this
situation we use a more accurate expression for ρ:

ρ(φ, t) =

−n2Dt+in(φ−ωt)

then we get a continuous equation of the form (4), with-
out the restriction (24). One special case is p = q = 1/2,
which has a zero drifting velocity, and the evolution of
the system is governed by pure diﬀusion process — the
random walk.

For another generalization we assume that the drifting

To relax this restriction, we modify our urn model by
assuming that at each time step the picked ball can have
probability p to be put into the next urn and probability
q = 1
p to be put into the previous urn. Hereafter we
call this modiﬁed model the pq-model. The pq-model is
also solvable [6] by using methods like those used in Ref.
[1]. The continuous limit of the pq-model can be derived
from the recurrence relation for fi:

The reason for why v and ω can freely vary with time
relies on Eq.(28). Recall that in our original multiurn
Ehrenfest model or the pq-model both the time interval
between two steps and the distance (angle diﬀerence) be-
tween two urns are undeﬁned. Thus in deriving the con-
tinuous limit of these models we do not have to adopt a
constant ∆t at each step or a ﬁxed ∆x (∆θ) between two
neighboring urns. If we relax the restriction in Eq. (28)
and modify them to ∆ts and ∆xi (∆θi), then the con-
tinuous limit of these quantities lead to v(t) or ω(t).

It is interesting to note that the solutions for the dif-
fusion equation (10) can be used to ﬁnd the wave func-
tion or Green’s function of some time-dependent quan-
tum mechanical problems [7]. The main idea is to deﬁne
a transformation appropriately between the parameters
used in the diﬀusion equation (10) or (4) and (6) and
those used in the corresponding Schr¨odinger equations.
For instance, consider a quantum point particle of charge

To be more speciﬁc, consider the case that the particle
moving on a circle of radius 1. Suppose the circle is lying
on the xy-plane and centered at (x, y) = (0, 0). The
vector potential can be chosen as A(t) = A(t) ˆeφ and is

In conclusion, we have derived the continuous limit of
a mutiurn Ehrenfest model, which is a diﬀusion equation
with a drifting velocity term. Solving the equation gives
us the correct time evolution behavior of the ball distri-
bution. A transformation was introduced, which changes
the solution of the diﬀusion equation to the correspond-
ing solution for the problem of a quantum particle moving
under the inﬂuence of a time-varying magnetic ﬁeld.

There are several factors which lead to a huge enhancement of parity and
time invariance violating eﬀects in the Ra atom: very close electronic levels of
opposite parity, the large nuclear charge Z and the collective nature of T,P-
odd nuclear moments. Experiments with Radium may be used to measure
it’s nuclear anapole, magnetic quadrupole and Schiﬀ moments. Such measure-
ments provide information about parity and time invariance violating nuclear
forces and electron-nucleon interactions.

Eﬀects of time invariance (T) and parity (P) violation are inversely proportional to the
distance between opposite parity energy levels. There is a pair of close opposite parity levels
in the Ra atom, the state |1 >= |7s6d J P = 2+ >, with E=13993.97 cm−1 and the state
|2 >= |7s7p J P = 1− >, with E=13999.38 cm−1, which are separated by a very small
interval (5 cm−1 ∼ 10−3 eV ). Note that there are also very close levels of opposite parity in
rare-earth atoms (e. g. in Dy atom [1,2]) which have been used to measure parity violation.
The advantage of Ra is that the electron states here are simple. Therefore, the mixing of
these states by the weak interactions is not suppressed and can be accurately calculated
(contrary to the mixing in the rare-earth atoms where there is a strong suppression of the
matrix elements due to the extreme complexity of the electronic eigenstates). There are
also extra factors of enhancement in Ra: the large value of the nuclear charge, Z=88 (the
P and T odd eﬀects increase with Z faster than Z 2) and the collective T,P-odd moments of
deformed Ra nuclei that are much greater than the same moments in spherical nuclei [3,4].
This makes Radium an attractive object for future experiments.

The close electron levels in Ra have diﬀerent electron angular momenta, J=1 and J=2.
The conservation of the total angular momentum F = J + I requires the involvement of
the nuclear spin I for these states to be mixed. Parity violating eﬀects in this case can
be produced by the nuclear anapole moment, which is directed along the nuclear spin. An
atomic electric dipole moment ( EDM) appears due to the interaction between the atomic
electrons and nuclear T,P-odd moments: magnetic quadrupole, Schiﬀ and electric octupole
moments. These eﬀects also can appear due to P, T-odd nuclear-spin-dependent electron-
nucleus interactions.

Let us start from an estimate of the contribution of the nuclear magnetic quadrupole
moment M. Atomic EDM in the metastable state |1 > appears due to mixing with the
opposite parity state |2 > by the Hamiltonian HM of the magnetic interaction between the
nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment and the atomic electrons. The atomic EDM is given
by the following formula

d = 2

< 1|HM |2 >< 2| − er|1 >
E1 − E2

The spin-orbit interaction in Radium is very large, therefore the electronic states can be
approximately described by jj-coupling. In this case |1 >≃ |7s6d3/2, J = 2 > and |2 >≃
|7s7p1/2, J = 1 >. An expression for the matrix elements of HM between the electronic
orbitals 6d3/2 and 7p1/2 can be found in [5]. Using this expression and simple numerical
estimate for the matrix element of the radius vector r between these orbitals we obtain the
following value for the Ra atomic EDM:

d ≃ 0.5 · 103Mme

where me is the electron mass.The magnetic quadrupole moment M is not zero in those
Ra isotopes that have nuclear spin I ≥ 1, for example, in 223Ra where I = 3/2. This
nucleus is deformed, therefore, it has a collective magnetic quadrupole moment M, which
was estimated in Ref. [3] to be M ≃ 10−19cm · η e/mp, where mp is the proton mass and η is
the dimensionless constant of the T,P-odd nucleon-nucleon interaction (the strength of the
T,P-odd interaction is measured in units of the weak interaction Fermi constant). The ﬁnal
result for the atomic EDM produced by the T,P-odd nucleon-nucleon interaction is

d ≃ 2 · 10−20η e cm

This value is about 3 · 104 times larger than EDM of Hg atom, which was measured in Ref.
[6] and gives the present best limit on η.

The atomic EDM can also be produced by the nuclear Schiﬀ moment (see, e. g. [5]).
However, the Schiﬀ moment produces a contact interaction only (an electric ﬁeld inside the
nucleus). The mixing of 6d3/2 and 7p1/2 states by this interaction is very small. However, one
can take into account conﬁguration mixing and use the maximal matrix element between the
7s and 7p1/2 states (for example, include mixing between the 7s6d and 7p7p conﬁgurations).
Also, there is theoretical and experimental evidence that the odd Radium isotopes have
octupole deformation, which leads to a huge 103 enhancement of the nuclear Schiﬀ moment
[4]. A rough estimate of the Schiﬀ moment contribution that includes this enhancement
gives a value of the atomic EDM comparable to the magnetic quadrupole contribution (3).
The advantage of the Schiﬀ moment is that it exists also for the isotopes with nuclear spin
I=1/2, like 225Ra (the magnetic quadrupole is equal to zero for such isotopes).

Finally, Radium atom can be used to measure the nuclear anapole moment. In principle,
there are several possibilities. One can measure, for example, interference between the Stark
and parity violating amplitudes in the transition between the ground state |0 >= |7s2, J =
0 > and excited state |1 >= |7s6d J P = 2+ >, E=13993.97 cm−1. The parity violating
amplitude E1pv appears due to the weak mixing between the state |1 > and the opposite
parity state |2 >= |7s7p J P = 1− >, E=13999.38 cm−1. Again, one has to take into
account the conﬁguration mixing since the direct matrix element < 6d3/2|Ha|7p1/2 > of
the interaction Ha between the atomic electrons and the anapole magnetic ﬁeld which is
localized inside the nucleus, is very small. A rough numerical estimate shows that due to
the closeness of the opposite parity levels and the large nuclear charge Z the amplitude E1pv
in Ra is several hundred times larger than similar amplitude ( induced by the anapole) in
Cs; the latter amplitude was recently measured in Ref. [7].

Note that in Ra the anapole-induced amplitude gives the dominating contribution to the
total parity violating amplitude. This may be an advantage since in Cs the anapole contri-
bution had to be separated from the weak charge contribution ( due to Z-boson exchange
between electrons and nucleus) which was two orders of magnitude larger than the anapole
contrubution. We may neglect the weak charge contribution in Ra since the states |1 > and
|2 > have diﬀerent electron angular momenta J=2 and J=1 and cannot be mixed by the
weak nuclear-spin-independent interaction.

In conclusion, we considered strongly enhanced parity and time invariance violating
eﬀects in Ra atom. Unfortunately, all odd Radium isotopes are unstable. However, recent
progress in trapping of unstable elements makes such experiments feasible. For example, an
experiment on parity violation in the short-lived Fr atom is in progress [8]. An experiment
with 225Ra, motivated by the work [4], has been discussed by S. Lamoreaux [9] and A.
Young [10]. The Los Alamos laboratory has a source of this isotope. Note also that the
electronic structure of Radium atom is relatively simple (two electrons above closed shells).
Our experience has shown that the accuracy of atomic calculations for such systems can be
about one per cent (see, e.g. [11]).

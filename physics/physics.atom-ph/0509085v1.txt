We describe a nonperturbative (in Zα) numerical evaluation of the one-photon electron self energy
for 3P1/2, 3P3/2, 4P1/2 and 4P3/2 states in hydrogenlike atomic systems with charge numbers Z = 1
to 5. The numerical results are found to be in agreement with known terms in the expansion of the
self energy in powers of Zα and lead to improved theoretical predictions for the self-energy shift of
these states.

PACS numbers: 12.20.Ds, 31.30.Jv, 06.20.Jr, 31.15.-p

In this brief report, we consider the one-loop self-
energy shift for excited P states in hydrogenlike systems.
High-accuracy numerical calculations of this eﬀect are
notoriously diﬃcult especially in the region of low nuclear
charge numbers Z, because the renormalization entails a
loss of up to nine decimal ﬁgures in the numerical calcu-
lation (the bound-electron self-energy is a residual eﬀect
which corresponds to the diﬀerence of the divergent self-
energy of the bound electron, minus the corresponding,
also divergent, shift for a free electron).

Furthermore,

the calculations are needed for a
self-consistent determination of fundamental constants,
which relies on the experimental/theoretical analysis of
a number of hydrogenic transitions.

One may obtain rather accurate values for the so-called
self-energy remainder functions by an interpolation [1] of
results for high and low nuclear charge numbers, which
rely on two diﬀerent approaches: (i) direct numerical cal-
culations at high nuclear charge numbers (see e.g. [2], no
Zα-expansion), and (ii) analytic calculations at low nu-
clear charge numbers, employing the Zα-expansion (see
e.g. [3]). In this case, the values obtained for low nuclear
charge depend on the interpolation method used, as well
as (of course) on the reliability of both the numerical cal-
culations at high Z and the analytic calculations for low
nuclear charge number.

Here, we follow a third approach and calculate the
self-energy without Zα-expansion, at low Z, using a
method described previously in [4, 5, 6]. Essentially,
this method relies on an adequate formulation of the
physical problem, by which divergent terms are suitably
identiﬁed and calculated separately using semi-analytic
approaches, and on the use of eﬃcient numerical meth-
ods for the high-accuracy calculation of the Green func-
tion of the relativistic electron and for the evaluation of
slowly convergent sums of intermediate angular momenta
(it might be useful to mention the keyword “convergence
acceleration” in that context [7]). On modern computer
processors, it is not even necessary to parallelize the cal-
culation; that latter approach had previously been em-
ployed in [4, 5].

All calculations reported here are carried out in the
no-recoil limit, which corresponds to an inﬁnitely heavy
nucleus. It might be instructive to recall the following
subtlety, which is well known, and to include a slight

detour: At the current level of accuracy and especially at
low Z, the reduced-mass dependence of the self energy
should be included for a comparison of the eﬀect with
experiment. This can be done a posteriori by considering
the semi-analytic expansion in Eq. (2) below, using the
formulas given in Eq. (2.5b) of Ref. [8], which indicate the
reduced-mass dependence of the coeﬃcients, and then the
self-energy remainder values given in Tables I— IV below
in this brief report.

Returning to the discussion of our calculation, we write
the (real part of the) energy shift ∆ESE due to the elec-
tron self-energy radiative correction as [8]

∆ESE =

speed of light in vacuum).
F (nLj, Zα), we follow the usual spectroscopic notation
for the quantum numbers of the single electron in a hy-
drogenlike ion; namely, we denote the principal quantum
number by n, the orbital angular momentum by L and
the total electron angular momentum by j.

FIG. 2: The analog of Fig. 1 for 4P1/2 and 4P3/2 states.

Our calculation of the nonperturbative (in Zα) elec-

3

tron self-energy for the 3Pj state (see Tables I and II) has
a numerical uncertainty of 2 Hz in atomic hydrogen. For
the 4Pj states, the numerical uncertainty is 1.3×Z 4 Hz
(see Table III and IV). In the non-recoil limit, our result
for 4P1/2, Z = 1, corresponds to a self-energy shift of

∆ESE(4P1/2, Z = 1) = −1 404.239(1) kHz ,

(7)

which is in agreement with the result −1 404.240(2)kHz
obtained in [12] via an interpolation of the low-Z ana-
lytic results and high-Z numerical data, conﬁrming (in
this particular case) the validity of the interpolation
procedure used for various excited hydrogenic states in
the latest adjustment of the fundamental physical con-
stants [13].
Indeed, all entries for the self-energy re-
mainder function GSE in Tables I—IV are in agreement
with those used in [13, 14] for the determination of the
fundamental constants, and for the precise calculation
of hydrogenic energy levels using the method of least
squares. Our all-order evaluation eliminates any uncer-
tainty due to the unknown higher-order analytic terms
that contribute to the bound electron self-energy of 3P
and 4P states [see Eq. (2)] and improves our knowledge
of the spectrum of hydrogenlike atoms (e.g. atomic hy-
drogen, He+). Furthermore, the numerical data for the
self-energy remainders check the validity of the highly in-
volved analytic approach that led to the evaluation of the
A60-coeﬃcients as listed in Eq. (6).

Abstract. – We observe light-induced frequency shifts in one-color photoassociative spectra
of magnetically trapped 4He∗ atoms in the metastable 23S1 state. A pair of ultracold spin-
polarized 23S1 helium atoms is excited into a molecular bound state in the purely long range
u potential connected to the 23S1 −23P0 asymptote. The shift arises from the optical coupling
0+
of the molecular excited bound state with the scattering states and the bound states of two
colliding 23S1 atoms. A linear dependence of frequency-shifts is found as a function of the PA
laser intensity and measured for several ro-vibrational levels in the 0+
u potential. Comparison
with a theoretical analysis provides a good indication for the s-wave scattering length a of the
quintet (5Σ+
g ) potential, 6.6 nm < a < 7.7 nm, which is signiﬁcantly lower than previous results
obtained by non-spectroscopic methods.

Introduction. – The present article describes a photoassociation (PA) experiment with
ultracold helium atoms in the metastable (τ ∼ 8000 s) 23S1 state. Since the laser cooling
technique was developed and provided sub-millikelvin ultracold atomic samples, the photoas-
sociation of such atoms has been of much interest and provided detailed information on the
inter-atomic interaction or collisional properties [1]. A detailed study of the PA spectra has
been performed for several ultracold thermal gases [2–6] or in condensates [7, 8]. The mea-
surement of the PA spectra also enables very precise measurement of the s-wave scattering
length [4, 9, 10], a crucial parameter for understanding the collisional properties of the ultra-
cold atoms or molecules and the dynamical behavior of the condensate. One can even change
the scattering length through optical Feshbach resonance [11–13], which is very useful as it
can be applicable to any species of atoms in either optical or magnetic trap.

One of the interesting phenomena in PA is the light induced frequency shift of the PA
spectra. The laser light couples the excited molecular bound state with continuum of scattering
states and ground molecular bound states, which results in the shift of the PA resonance curve
when the laser frequency is swept over the resonance. As demonstrated in ref. [8,14] for Na and
ref. [15,16] for Li, the light shift of the PA spectra is clearly visible at moderate laser intensity

Here, the colliding atoms at energy Esc ≈ kBT are driven close to resonance with the deepest bound
state v=0 of 0+
u . This bound state is embedded in the continuum of scattering states, represented in
grey, which leads to an energy shift. The least bound state v=14 of the 5Σ+

resonance, also contributes to the shift.

for the ultracold samples. The observed shifts are described by a theoretical calculation based
on the theory developed by Bohn and Julienne [17] or Simoni et al. [18].

In this letter, we report the ﬁrst observation of the light shift of the J=1 ro-vibrational
states recently found by our group [6, 19] in the purely long-range 0+
u interaction potential for
4He atoms. The v=0, 1, 2 levels (see ﬁg. 1) can be populated from two ultracold colliding
atoms in the 23S1 state excited by absorption of laser light red-detuned from the 23S1 − 23P0
transition. From the measurement of the the light shift for the several vibrational levels, we
deduce an estimation of the value of the s-wave scattering length of the spin polarized 4He∗
atoms in 5Σ+
g quintet potential. This is the ﬁrst spectroscopic measurement of a and provides
signiﬁcantly lower value compared to the previous measurement [20–23].

The analysis of the measured frequency shifts is based on the work of ref. [17, 18] and
detailed in ref. [24]. We consider the light coupling of the molecular bound state in the purely
long-range 0+
u potential to the continuum of scattering states in l = 0, 2, 4 waves as well as in
several spin states allowed by selection rules. In our experimental conditions (ultracold atoms
held in a magnetic trap), the only signiﬁcant entrance collisional channel corresponds to two
spin polarized atoms colliding in the s-wave. However, the contribution to the light shift of
all other possible allowed channels may not be negligible [8]. In addition, we have to include
the contributions of ground molecular bound-states which are dominated by the one of the
least bound state v=14 of the 5Σ+
g potential as the other levels are much far away from the
dissociation limit. In our case, the contribution to the shift of the v=14 state is not negligible
compared to those of the scattering states and the total shift of the PA spectra is found to

be a sensitive and monotonic function of the scattering length [24]. This enables a precise
determination of a through the measurement of the light shift of the PA spectra.

Experimental Procedure. – The spin-polarized ultracold atomic samples (4He∗) are con-
ﬁned in a magnetic trap of three-coils Ioﬀe-Pritchard type and cooled down to µK range by
radio-frequency-induced evaporation. The bias ﬁeld is typically 3 G and the density is of order
1013 atoms/cm3. The PA experiment is performed at a temperature of around 16 µK, above
the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation [20, 21] to avoid mean ﬁeld shifts.

The PA laser is composed of a DBR diode laser with an external cavity and a 1 W Yb-doped
ﬁber ampliﬁer. The PA pulse is focused with a waist size of 640 µm on the atomic sample of
approximately 30 µm diameter (in radial direction) and switched on for tens of µs to a few ms
depending on the laser intensity. Parallel to the trap bias magnetic ﬁeld and σ− polarized, it
can selectively produce the desired bound states (from v=4 to v=0, with J=1) in the purely
long-range 0+
u potential by setting its detuning between -20 MHz and -1.4 GHz [6, 19]. In
order to obtain large detuning, a heterodyne technique is used: the beating signal between
the PA laser and a master laser is monitored by a fast photodiode, mixed down with a local
oscillator and converted to DC voltage which is then fed back to the current supply of the PA
laser. The master laser is locked to the atomic D0 transition. The linewidth of the PA laser
is measured to be 0.6 MHz.

The PA resonance curves are obtained by a calorimetric method [6]. The temperature

signal deduced by ballistic expansion is monitored. For each PA line curve, the PA laser
frequency is scanned over 20 MHz by steps of 0.3 MHz by changing the RF-frequency of an
acousto-optic modulator in the PA beam line. Fig. 2(a) shows a PA resonance line obtained
at low PA laser intensity. The width is typically 3 MHz. When the PA laser intensity is
increased, the line is red shifted and broadened as shown in ﬁg. 2(b). The pulse duration is
decreased as the laser intensity is increased in order to keep a reasonable amount of loss of
atoms and furthermore adjusted for optimizing the resonance signal at each intensity.

Frequency shifts. – For each vibrational level, we measure the shifts δ of the center of
the resonance curve for diﬀerent PA laser intensities I. Typical results are shown in Fig. 3.
The error bar is explained as follows. At high intensities, the error bar in δ increases due to
signal broadening and large shot-to-shot noise. Close to zero intensity, we assign an error of
0.6 Mhz to δ resulting from ﬂuctuations of experimental parameters, which is larger than the
error of the lorentzian ﬁt.

Results displayed in ﬁg. 3 show a linear dependance of δ as a function of I. The maximum
measurable light shift is limited by two experimental factors. First, the signal broadens with
the laser intensity. Second, to keep a reasonable amount of loss of atoms, the pulse duration
is decreased when I is increased as mentioned earlier, which is limited by the 5 µs switching
time of the AOM. These constraints are more severe for v=2. The ﬁtting error in the slope is
2 % for v=0, 2.5 % for v=1, and 4.5 % for v=2.

We found that the individual slopes may vary from day to day by approximately 10 %,
due to ﬂuctuations of the relative alignment between the PA laser beam and the center of the

provided by our theoretical calculation [24]. The scattering length is estimated from the measurement
of the δv=1/δv=0 ratio: the grey area represents the experimental uncertainty. It provides a value for
the scattering length of 6.6 nm < a < 7.7 nm. The uncertainty of δv=2/δv=0 measurement is larger.
The dashed line on the ﬁgure represents the δv=2/δv=0 value which includes and conﬁrms the a value

magnetic trap. We measure the slopes of the three levels in a single run without interrupt
under experimental conditions as similar as possible. The main systematic uncertainty on
the intensity I comes from the diﬃculty to measure precisely the beam diameter at the cloud
location, the calibration of our laser power meter, a possible slight misalignment, and also
the optical losses on the glass cell walls. We estimate that these factors can lead up to a 50
% error on the absolute value of I. Our results will rely on the ratio of the slopes for two
vibrational levels : v=0 and v=1 or v=0 and v=2, which is not aﬀected by the systematic
error on the intensity.

In addition, the light polarization is not pure due to the imperfection of our optical ele-
ments. We measure around 2 % impurity in the electric ﬁeld at σ− polarization. This impurity
of polarization is taken into account in the comparaison with our theoretical calculation.

Scattering length. – The ratios of the frequency shifts are measured several times and the
results are 1.71 ± 0.14 for δv=1/δv=0 and 4.20 ± 0.48 for δv=2/δv=0. The result for δv=1/δv=0
is more precise because larger shifts are measured and the linear ﬁt produces less error.

Compared with the calculations described in [24], the measured ratio of the light shift for
δv=1/δv=0 provides a determination of the scattering length of 6.6 nm < a < 7.7 nm as shown
in ﬁgure 4(a), where the curves are derived from the analysis of [24]. The ratio δv=2/δv=0
provide less precise yet compatible values.

In order to conﬁrm the validity of our measurement and calculation, we performed the
same frequency shift measurement with linear polarization (50 % σ− and σ+ mixture). As

6

mentioned above, l 6= 0 channels have a non negligible contribution to the shift, which makes it
polarization dependant [24]. As shown in ﬁgure 4(b), the range of the values for a deduced in
the case of linear polarization is consistent with the results obtained with circular polarization.
Using ref [24], one can infer from the present determination of a the absolute values of the
slopes of δv as a function of I for diﬀerent polarizations. A systematic discrepancy of 40% is
found with the experimental values, which are smaller in absolute value. This is attributed to
an overestimation of the intensity I.

One can compare this new value of a with the previous experimental determination
which have generally given larger values. The Bose-Einstein condensate expansion gave
20 ± 10 nm [20] and 16 ± 8 nm [21]. The measurement of the elastic collision rate based
on the evaporative cooling rate gave 10 ± 5 nm [22]. These values have large uncertainty and
are compatible with the present measurement. The main discrepancy occurs with the value
provided by the Orsay group 11.3 +2.5
−1.0 nm derived from inelastic collision rates combined with
critical temperature [23]. It is interesting to note that the smaller value presented in this letter
can explain why the hydrodynamic regime could not be reached in the previous experiment
done in our group regrarding the collective excitation of the Bose-Einstein condensate [25].

It is also interesting to compare the present value of a with theoretical ones. The helium
4He∗ atom is simple enough so that ab-initio interaction potentials have been derived. Using
the potential of Starck and Meyer [26] a value of a = 8.3 nm is found [27]. Recently, a value
of 8.0 nm < a < 12.2 nm has been calculated [29]. Present results might be useful to improve
the knowledge of the interaction potential. After completion of the present work, we became
aware of a recent ab-initio calculation of the interaction potential and a value of scattering
length by Przybytek and Jeziorski [30] which agrees well with our measurement.

Conclusion. – The light-induced frequency shift of the PA spectra of metastable Helium
atoms are measured precisely and compared with our theoretical calculation to be described in
a forthcoming paper [24]. The measurements of several ro-vibrational levels at diﬀerent light
polarizations are considered. The ﬁrst PA spectroscopic measurement of the s-wave scattering
length of spin-polarized Helium atoms in metastable 23S1 state is provided. The value for a
presented in this letter is signiﬁcantly lower compared to the previous values.

A more precise spectroscopic method to determine the scattering length would be to mea-
sure the binding energy of the least bound state, v=14 in the ground state 5Σ+
g potential with
a two-color PA experiment. The restricted range found in the present work for the value of
the scattering length provides us with a narrow window for the expected position of the least
bound state. The two-color PA experiment is in progress in our group.

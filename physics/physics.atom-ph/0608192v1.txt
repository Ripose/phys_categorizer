Abstract— We consider the most accurate tests of bound state
QED theory of the hyperﬁne splitting in two-body atoms related
to the HFS interval of the 1s state in muonium and positronium
and the 2s state in hydrogen, deuterium and the helium-3 ion.
We summarize their QED theory and pay special attention
to involved effects of strong interactions and to recent optical
measurements of the 2s HFS interval in hydrogen and deuterium.
We present results for speciﬁc ratios of the 1s − 2s frequencies
in hydrogen and deuterium which happen to be among the most
accurately measured and calculated quantities.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent progress in precision optical measurements provides
as with new accurate data related to simple atoms. The
data are related to such quantities as the Lamb shift and
hyperﬁne intervals. Previously such data were available only
from microwave measurements. Precision atomic theory is
bound state quantum electrodynamics.

Quantum electrodynamics (QED) by inself is a well estab-
lished theory. It successfully describe pure leptonic atoms and
partly conventional atoms such as hydrogen. Problems with
the accuracy of theoretical predictions arise because QED is
incomplete in a sense. Even pure leptonic systems are not
free of hadronic effects which enter through virtual hadronic
intermediate states. In case of hydrogen, deuterium etc we
should take into account distribution of the electric charge,
magnetic moment and some more complicated effects. Here
we consider QED tests involving the hyperﬁne splitting in light
hydrogen-like atoms.

Bound state QED is much more complicated than QED for
free particles and deserves serious tests. Some of such tests
are signiﬁcant for the determination of fundamental constants
and in particular for the ﬁne structure constant α, which may
be obtained from the hyperﬁne structure (HFS) interval in
muonium (see reviews [1], [2], [3] for detail).

The HFS interval in hydrogen and some other light atoms
has been known for a while with a record experimental
accuracy, however, the related theory suffers from uncertainties
of the nuclear structure effects at the one-ppm level or higher.
We consider a few possibilities to perform QED tests going
far beyond this level of accuracy. Some of them are of
metrological interest.

The quantities of interest for the QED tests, such as the
Lamb shift and the HFS intervals, lie in the microwave domain
and to perform an optical measurement for such a quantity one

has to deal with a number of optical quantities and to combine
their frequencies to extract a microwave value of interest.
Some combinations of this kind can be determined with an
extremely high accuracy because in differential measurements
some systematic effects can be cancelled.

In particular, we present here results for speciﬁc ratios of
the 1s − 2s transition frequencies in hydrogen and deuterium

RHFS(1s − 2s, H) =

RHFS(1s − 2s, D) =

f (1s − 2s, F = 0)
f (1s − 2s, F = 1)
f (1s − 2s, F = 1/2)
f (1s − 2s, F = 3/2)

which happen to be among the most accurately measured and
calculated quantities

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF THE RATIO
RHFS(1s − 2s) IN HYDROGEN AND DEUTERIUM
Some time ago a long-term program was launched at
Max-Planck-Institut f¨ur Quantenoptik to built a new natural
frequency standard locked to the ultraviolet 1s − 2s transition
[4]. Applying the hydrogen spectrometer developed for this
program we performed differential measurements for hyperﬁne
different components of the 1s − 2s transition frequency in
hydrogen [5] and deuterium [6] (see Fig. 1 for the level scheme
in the deuterium atom).

The ratios under question can be present in the form

RHFS(1s − 2s, H) = 1 +

RHFS(1s − 2s, D) = 1 +

where

∆HFS(H) = f (1s − 2s, F = 0) − f (1s − 2s, F = 1) ,
∆HFS(D) = f (1s − 2s, F = 1/2) − f (1s − 2s, F = 3/2)

are the subjects of measurements.

The results of our measurements [5], [6], [7]

∆HFS(H) = 1242 848 892(16) Hz ,
∆HFS(D) = 286 459 899(7) Hz

The hyperﬁne interval of the 2s state was measured by
microwave spectroscopy in hydrogen [8] and deuterium [9]
a long time ago. Only recently (in 2000) the hydrogen result
was somewhat improved [10]. Our optical results [5], [6] agree
well with the early microwave data mentioned above and are
about three times as precise.

III. THEORETICAL DETERMINATION OF THE RATIO
RHFS(1s − 2s) IN HYDROGEN AND DEUTERIUM
For a theoretical determination of the ratio RHFS(1s − 2s)

it is helpful to re-write the ratios in the form

While the frequency of the hyperﬁne interval of the 1s state,
fHFS(1s), is well-known experimentally

fHFS(1s, H) = 1420 405 751.768(1) Hz ,
fHFS(1s, D) = 327 384 352.522(2) Hz ,

the speciﬁc difference

D21 = 23 · fHFS(2s) − fHFS(1s)

(11)

is a subject of theoretical investigations.

As was shown recently [11], an accurate QED test compet-
itive with other QED tests on the hyperﬁne theory is possible
with ordinary hydrogen atoms. To reach a sensitivity to higher-
order QED corrections, one has to combine the HFS intervals
of the 1s and 2s states in the same atom in the form of D21.
That eliminates the leading nuclear contributions.

A substantial cancellation of the nuclear structure contribu-
tions takes place because the nuclear contribution in leading
approximation is of a speciﬁc factorized form of
2

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

In other words, the correction is a product of a certain nuclear-
structure parameter A(Nucl) and the squared value of the wave
function at the origin

with n, l being the principal and orbital quantum numbers,
respectively, and mR being the reduced mass of the electron.
Still there are higher-order corrections due to the nuclear
effects which are of a more complicated form and survive
this cancellation. However, they are much smaller and under
control [12]. The theory of D21 in light hydrogen-like atoms
is presented in Table I [12], [13].

Here we updated results for the one-loop correction by
applying the extrapolation procedure developed in [13], [7]
to recently obtained numerical data related to hydrogen-like
atoms for Z ≥ 5. Our one-loop effective coefﬁcients are found
to be CSE(Z = 1) = 2.4(4) and CSE(Z = 2) = 2.3(2) in
notation of [13].

IV. SUMMARY OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL
DETERMINATION OF THE RATIO RHFS(1s − 2s) IN
HYDROGEN AND DEUTERIUM

Recently there have been a number of discussions on
most precisely known quantities from an experimental or a
theoretical point of view. It is indeed quite tricky when one
discusses a fractional accuracy because in experiment and
theory the accurate value can be often achieved when the
dominant contribution into a certain quantity is known and
a subject of determination is a difference between a real value
and a dominant contribution. An example is, e.g, so-called
measurements of the Lamb shift in the ground state in the hy-
drogen atom, where two transitions, with frequencies different
by a factor approximately equal to four, were compared

4f (2s − 4s)
f (1s − 2s)

f (1s − 3s)

[16],

[17].

We consider here a speciﬁc ratio of the 1s − 2s transition
frequencies in hydrogen and deuterium which offers one of
the most accurate values in both theoretical and experimental
lists. The highest accuracy was also achieved by a splitting
of the ratio into well-established large contributions and small
corrections left to determine experimentally or theoretically.
The results on the determination of RHFS(1s − 2s) in
hydrogen and deuterium are summarized in Table II, which
shows that measurements and calculations of the HFS ratio
of the 1s − 2s transition frequencies have record fractional
accuracy and the theory is in a good agreement with the
experiment. Nevertheless, one should not overestimate the
importance of such an accuracy. From experimental point of
view the most ambitious task is to obtain the highest accuracy
for a directly measured value, it is similar for theory. What is
more important is which effects could affect the accuracy. In
our case, for the experiment those are spin-dependent effects
in the absolute 1s − 2s measurement. Theoretical effects
which limit the accuracy of our calculations related to our
understanding of so-called state-dependent part of the fourth-
order recoil corrections and of the one-loop and two-loop
self-energy contributions. Both theoretical and experimental
problems mentioned are actual problems to be studied.

V. OTHER TESTS OF BOUND STATE QED RELATED TO THE
HYPERFINE EFFECTS

A. The difference D21 in atoms other than hydrogen and
deuterium

The 1s and 2s hyperﬁne intervals are measured much
more accurately compared to a theoretical prediction which
can be made for each of them separately. However, for
the difference D21 the experimental and theoretical accuracy
become competitive. While for 3He+ the experiment [18] is
already really competitive with the theory [13], in the case
of hydrogen and deuterium, the theoretical uncertainty is up-
to-date substantially better than the uncertainty related to the
measurements of the HFS interval in the 2s state. Among
other QED tests with D21 the case of the helium-3 ion is
most sensitive to various higher-order bound state QED effects.
That is partly because of a higher fractional accuracy in the
determination of the 2s hyperﬁne interval [18]1

f D
HFS(2s) = −1083 354 981(9) Hz

(14)

and partly because various higher-order effects scales with the
nuclear charge Z as Z 5 or Z 6 and thus are enhanced very
much for the helium ion (Z = 2) in comparison with hydrogen
and deuterium (Z = 1).

B. The 1s hyperﬁne interval in muonium

An alternative opportunity to verify precision theory for
the hyperﬁne effects is to study pure leptonic atoms. One of
them is muonium, a bound system of a positive muon and
an electron. In contrast to the hydrogen atom, the nucleus,
a muon, is is not inﬂuenced by the strong interaction. The
strong interaction enters only the system through hadronic
vacuum polarization, which sets an ultimate limit on any
QED tests with muonium. Uncertainties for QED itself and
for the hadronic effects are presented in [19], [1]. Muonium
has metrological interest due to determination of α, mµ/me,
µµ/µp etc [3].

C. The 1s hyperﬁne interval in positronium

Another atomic system of pure leptonic nature is positro-
nium. The nucleus, a positron, is a very light one. As a
result, various recoil effects, which are crucially important
in advanced HFS theory, are enhanced and therefore critical
QED tests can be performed with a relatively low experimental
accuracy (see, e.g., [1] for detail).

VI. SUMMARY OF HFS TESTS OF BOUND STATE QED

Most recent results for precision test of bound state QED
involving the hyperﬁne structure of light hydrogen-like atoms
are summarized in Table III. All tests presented are competitive
and the theoretical accuracy is limited by our ability to

1The minus sign in the case of helium-3 ion reﬂects the fact that the
direction of the nuclear magnetic moment is opposite to the nuclear spin and
that a level with higher total angular momentum (F = 1) is below the level
with the lower value (F = 0). That is different from the atomic hyperﬁne
structure of atoms where the nuclear magnetic moment is directed along the
nuclear spin (hydrogen, deuterium, muonium etc.).

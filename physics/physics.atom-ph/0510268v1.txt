Abstract

We analyze the dynamics of atom-laser interactions for atoms having multiple, closely spaced,

excited hyperﬁne manifolds. The system is treated fully quantum mechanically, including the

atom’s center-of-mass degree of freedom, and motion is described in a polarization gradient ﬁeld

created by a three-dimensional laser conﬁguration. We develop the master equation describing

this system, and then specialize to the low-intensity limit by adiabatically eliminating the excited

states. We show how this master equation can be simulated using the Monte Carlo wave function

technique, and we provide details of how to implement this procedure. Monte Carlo calculations of

steady state atomic momentum distributions for two fermionic alkaline earth isotopes, 25Mg and

87Sr, interacting with a three-dimensional lin-

-lin laser conﬁguration are presented, providing

estimates of experimentally achievable laser-cooling temperatures.

INTRODUCTION

The complex behavior that occurs when a multilevel atom interacts with polarization-

gradient ﬁelds has been of interest for some time now. Sub-Doppler cooling [1] occurs

because of elaborate optical-pumping processes produced by laser light in atoms with sub-

level structure, as seen, for example, in the lin-

-lin and the σ+-σ− laser conﬁgurations. The

⊥

semiclassical understanding of these interactions [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] in one or more dimensions

has led to a detailed qualitative understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Semiclassi-

cal analysis has even in some cases provided quantitative predictions of sub-Doppler laser

cooling temperatures measured in experiments [7].

However, the most direct route to a quantitative understanding of atom-laser interactions

is via a fully quantized master equation for the atom, in which the center-of-mass (CM)

motion of the atom taken into account quantum mechanically. This allows behavior at low

laser intensities and low atomic velocities, the regime which laser cooling strives to obtain, to

be described correctly. The drawback of solving such a master equation, however, is the large

number of basis states required for the calculation, due to the additional momentum states.

This problem becomes especially pronounced when attempting to model three-dimensional

(3D) systems, where the state-space grows as the cube of the number of momentum states

needed.

The Monte Carlo wave-function (MCWF) technique, introduced in the early 1990’s has

allowed signiﬁcant progress to be made on the subject of atom-photon interactions in 3D

as well as lower-dimensional calculations. The MCWF technique is a simulation procedure

for the master equation that involves propagation of single stochastic wave functions, rather

than density operators, with random processes occurring at random intervals due to inter-

actions with the photon ﬁeld that cause spontaneous emission. It has been shown that this

method is equivalent to the master equation in the limit of a large number of independent

stochastic wave functions [8]. The MCWF technique has been successfully utilized to cal-

culate 3D sub-Doppler laser cooling temperatures for atoms with Zeeman degeneracy in the

ground and excited states [9].

In this paper, we are interested in describing laser cooling for atoms with multiple closely

spaced hyperﬁne excited-state manifolds. Figure 1 provides a graphical illustration of this

type of atomic conﬁguration. This situation is of importance, for example, in alkaline-

the excited-state manifolds are of the order or smaller than the natural linewidth of the transition,

the usual sub-Doppler cooling transition (Fg ↔
must be taken into account.

Fe = Fg +1) is not isolated and the other manifolds

earth atoms with nonzero nuclear magnetic moment.

If the excited state manifolds are

spaced in energy on the order or smaller than the excited state linewidth γ, coherences

between these manifolds become nonnegligible, and can have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the optical

pumping processes required for sub-Doppler cooling and on the dynamics of the atom-photon

interaction. Sub-Doppler laser cooling was experimentally identiﬁed in fermionic 87Sr [10],

despite signiﬁcant spectral overlap in the excited state. At the time, it was hypothesized

that the large ground-state degeneracy in 87Sr (due to the large nuclear spin I = 9/2) was

somehow able to overcome the decrease in cooling due to the spectral overlap. Other systems

with spectral overlap in the excited state are 39K [11], 7Li [12], and the fermionic isotopes

of Yb [13]. Our goal in the paper is to provide a detailed discussion of the theoretical

techniques required to model such systems realistically. In a future publication, we plan to

present comprehensive laser-cooling predictions for a variety of atoms.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section II, we develop the master equation for

a laser-driven atom with multiple excited-state manifolds, and then specialize this equation

to the low-intensity limit. In Section III, we introduce the MCWF technique and apply it

to this low-intensity master equation. In Section V, we perform full Monte Carlo master-

equation simulations for 25Mg and 87Sr atoms in a 3D lin-

-lin laser conﬁguration as an

II. MASTER EQUATION IN THE LOW-INTENSITY LIMIT

In this section we develop the master equation describing a multilevel atom interacting

with a coherent laser ﬁeld and coupled to a vacuum photon ﬁeld. It is this equation, with

quantized atomic CM, that will provide an accurate description of atom-photon dynamics,

and this master equation will provide the basis for the Monte Carlo simulations that will be

discussed later.

The full Hamiltonian for the atom-laser system plus the radiation ﬁeld is

H = HA + HR + VA−L + VA−R,

(1)

where HA =

2m is the bare atomic Hamiltonian, HR is the vacuum radiation
ﬁeld Hamiltonian, and VA−L and VA−R are the atom-laser and atom-radiation ﬁeld coupling

i

~ωiPi + P 2

P

terms, respectively. In the atomic Hamiltonian, Pi is a projection operator onto the i-th
internal excited-state manifold, ~ωi is the energy of the i-th excited-state manifold relative

to the ground-state manifold, P is the atomic CM momentum operator, m is the atomic

mass, and the sum runs over all excited-state manifolds. We have assumed in Eq. (1) that

the eﬀects of atom-laser and atom-radiation-ﬁeld coupling are independent [14].

We can view Eq. (1) in terms of system-reservoir interactions. The system consists of the

atom, the laser, and their interaction. The system Hamiltonian is

HS = HA + VA−L.

The reservoir is the vacuum radiation ﬁeld, having many more modes than the system. With

the Markov approximation, along with a few other approximations, the master equation is

then given by

˙σ =

~ [σ, HS] +

Lsp[σ].

The operator σ is the system reduced density operator element, i.e., the reservoir degrees

interaction between the atom and the vacuum photon ﬁeld, and provides for the phenomenon

This form of a Rabi frequency, deﬁned in terms of the reduced matrix element between the

J = Jg ground state and the J = Je excited state, is convenient because, in general, Rabi

frequencies for transitions to diﬀerent excited-state manifolds will not be the same.

Next, we observe that the second term in Eq. (9) is comprised of excited-state projection

operators both pre- and post-multiplying the system density operator. Thus, it is clear that

this term can be absorbed into the free-evolution commutator term in Eq. (3), allowing the

master equation to be equivalently described by Hamiltonian evolution determined by an

eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ, plus a term which is commonly called a jump term, and which

cannot be written in the form of a commutator with the system density operator. We thus

hyperﬁne manifold. The master equation given in Eq. (17) is fully general, but has been

written in a form that will facilitate setting up a stochastic wave function simulation using

the MCWF technique described later.

We would like to now specialize the master equation just discussed to the limit of low

laser intensity. Speciﬁcally, this limit is valid when the saturation parameter for the ith

excited-state hyperﬁne manifold,

si =

Ω2/2
i + (γ/2)2 ,
δ2

(19)

for the atom is small, which occurs when the laser intensity is small or the laser detuning

from the atomic transition is large. In this limit, the excited states are said to adiabatically

follow the ground states. The excited states can then be eliminated from the equations of

motion, resulting in a master equation in terms of only the ground-state sub-density-matrix,

σgg = PgσPg.

III. THE MONTE CARLO WAVE-FUNCTION TECHNIQUE

The MCWF [8, 9, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] technique is a means of interpreting a system-

reservoir master equation — which describes the evolution of a density operator for a system

interacting with a large external reservoir — as the evolution of an ensemble of individual

wave functions, each undergoing random quantum jumps. The free evolution of the stochastic

wave functions is determined by the eﬀective Hamiltonian that we found in the previous

section. The nature of the quantum jumps is determined by the leftover term in the master

equation, which cannot be absorbed into the free-evolution commutator. The components

of this leftover term are often called quantum-jump operators.

In the following, we will deal primarily with the master equation in the low-intensity limit,

as developed in the previous section, although the methods could just as easily be applied

to the arbitrary-intensity master equation. The low-intensity limit, however, provides a

reduction in the number of internal atomic states required in the calculation, and this will

be beneﬁcial for performing calculations later. Furthermore, since the lowest temperatures

8

are achieved for low laser intensities, such a specialization does not hinder our ability to

calculate lower bounds of temperature.

Having already expressed the master equation in a form involving an eﬀective Hamiltonian

and a jump term in the previous section, the application of the MCWF technique is rather

straightforward along the lines developed in the literature (see, in particular, Ref. [8]). For a

single stochastic wave function, the procedure is as follows. First, set the wave function to an

initial value. Then, numerically propagate the wave function for a time step δt according to

the eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ only, from an initial value

to a ﬁnal value

(cid:19)

Restrictions on the size of δt are given such that the ﬁrst-order truncation of the time-

evolution operator in Eq. (25) is approximately valid. We note that Heﬀ is non-Hermitian

by construction, as a result of absorbing parts of the relaxation operator into the original

(Hermitian) bare system Hamiltonian. Because of this, propagation with Heﬀ will not con-

serve the norm of the wave function when propagated to

ψ(1)(t + δt)

. The time step δt of

the propagation must be chosen so that δp

ψ(1)(t + δt) ψ(1)(t + δt)

δp.

(26)

The quantity δp is the loss of norm resulting from propagating with Heﬀ for a time step δt,

and is found to be

The total loss of norm has been decomposed into individual elements each corresponding to

a particular type of interaction with the reservoir (i.e., the q-value of the interaction, or the

excited state i involved). These individual contributions are given by

(28)

We see that the loss of norm due to a given type of interaction with the reservoir is determined

by the quantum-mechanical expectation value of the product of jump operators of this type

(cid:10)

h

of interaction. The loss of norm δp can also be interpreted as the probability for a quantum

jump to occur.

After the wave function has been propagated as described above, and the values of δpi,q

calculated, it must then be determined whether or not a quantum jump occurred. This is

achieved by generating a pseudo-random number on a computer and comparing it to the

value of the total jump probability δp. If the random number is less than δp, a quantum

jump occurred, and if it is greater, no quantum jump occurred. If a quantum jump does

occur, the type of quantum jump must also be calculated by comparing the random number

with the individual sub-probabilities δpi,q in the same manner.

If a quantum jump of type q, i occurs, we must apply the quantum jump lowering operator

B(i)

q (R, k) to the wave function from the beginning of the time step,

(29)

The square-root factor in front of the lowering operator is necessary for renormalization. If

no quantum jump occurs, then we simply renormalize the wave function.

The resulting wave function is then used as the starting point for propagation over the

next time step, and the procedure is repeated.

A good approximation of the true system density matrix is achieved by combining the

trajectories of a number of independently propagated stochastic wave functions, each tra-

jectory having a unique sequence of pseudo-random numbers. (A thorough discussion of

the statistical issues involved with the MCWF technique can be found in Ref. [8].) Once

a suitable ensemble of stochastic wave function trajectories has been obtained, an estimate

of the true expectation value of an operator is found by taking the ensemble average of

the expectation value of that operator with respect to the stochastic wave functions. For

example, an estimate of the average kinetic energy at a time t for a system for which N

where ψi(t) is the ith stochastic wave function, given at time t.

Figure 2 demonstrates a simple example of the application of the MCWF technique,

wherein the average kinetic energy is calculated for a two-level atom interacting with a

10

one-dimensional standing-wave ﬁeld. For this calculation, we have used a Rabi frequency

of Ω = γ/2 and a detuning of δ =
γ/2, where γ is the decay rate of the upper to the
lower atomic state, and we have set γ = 400Er, where Er = ~2k2/2m is the recoil energy.

−

The atomic kinetic energy, averaged over 500 stochastic wave functions each initialized to

zero momentum, is plotted as a function of time, with error bars indicating the error in the

ensemble average for a given time. The separation of the transient relaxation period from

the steady-state is clear, the steady state regime being characterized by ﬂuctuations in the

average energy about a mean. This noise is due to the ﬁnite number of stochastic wave

functions being used, and if a greater number of wave functions were used, the amplitude of

the ﬂuctuations would be decreased. In the limit of an inﬁnite number of wave functions,

the true density-matrix solution of the master equation would be obtained. An estimate

of the steady-state kinetic energy is found by time-averaging the calculated data over the

entire steady-state regime. Since this is a larger ensemble than the set of wave functions for

a single time, the error of such an average will be smaller than the error bars shown in the

ﬁgure.

IV. CALCULATIONS FOR 25MG AND 87SR

The purpose of this section is to illustrate the application of the theory developed up

to this point to a complicated system. We wish to quantitatively study the dynamics of

particular atoms interacting with 3D polarization-gradient laser ﬁelds. The balance of the

frictional cooling forces along with the diﬀusion experienced by the atom due to spontaneous

emission and its interaction with the laser leads to a steady state momentum distribution

that determines the temperature of a gas of such atoms. In particular, we will study here

the cooling of the fermionic isotopes of the two Alkaline-earth atoms, 25Mg and 87Sr. These

atoms, having nonzero nuclear magnetic moment, have degenerate (assuming zero magnetic

ﬁeld) Zeeman sublevels. These sublevels allow for the mechanism of sub-Doppler cooling

in an appropriate laser conﬁguration. We consider the 3D lin-

-lin laser conﬁguration,

⊥

consisting of a pair of opposing beams along each cartesian axis, in which each beam is

linearly polarized orthogonal to its opposing beam. Furthermore, for this calculation, we set

to zero the relative phases of the three sets of laser pairs.

Having a nuclear spin of I = 5/2, the 1S0 state of 25Mg results in a hyperﬁne ground

FIG. 2: (Color online) An example of a characteristic MCWF stochastic trajectory. Shown is the

average of the atomic CM energy over 500 independent stochastic wave functions, as a function of

time, for a two-level atom in a 1D standing-wave laser ﬁeld. The energy is given in units of the

recoil energy Er = ~2k2/2m, and time is given in units of the inverse recoil frequency ω−1

r = ~/Er.

All wave functions are initialized in the ground state of the atom and localized in momentum space

with zero momentum. The steady state, wherein the system ﬂuctuates around an average value,

is seen to be achieved after a transient relaxation period. Error bars indicate the variance in the

data at each given time for the ensemble of 500 stochastic wave functions. An estimate of the

steady-state atomic CM energy is obtained by performing a time-average over all wave functions

for all times after the relaxation regime. The error bar of such an average will be smaller than the

error bars in the ﬁgure, which apply only to the data for a given time.

state with 6 sublevels. Use of the low-intensity master equation given in Eq. (17) allows

us to consider only these 6 internal states of the atom, since the excited states have been

adiabatically eliminated in this regime. However, as noted in Ref. [9], a momentum grid
extending to 20~k in each direction with a spacing of ~k would yield a density matrix

with (6

1011 elements. A direct solution of this master equation is not

numerically feasible, even without considering the further increases in matrix size necessary

to describe the master equation relaxation operator in Liouville space [24]. On the other

hand, the MCWF method only requires numerical propagation of individual wave functions,

which would be represented by vectors with 6

105 elements. If the number of

independent stochastic wave functions required to achieve satisfactory convergence for the

calculation of a particular property of the system is not unreasonably large, the MCWF

method provides a distinct advantage over a direct master-equation solution.

We follow the procedure outlined in Section III, working in the low-intensity limit in

order to reduce the number of internal atomic states in the calculation, which increases the

eﬃciency of calculation. Since laser cooling is most eﬀective at low laser intensities, this

turns out to be a useful regime in which to work, with the additional beneﬁt that lower

temperatures require a smaller number of atomic CM momentum states in the calculation.

We must determine the eﬀective Hamiltonian as given in Eq. (22) and the jump operators as

given in Eqs. (23) and (24) for each atom, and for the particular laser ﬁeld being considered.

We consider here the lin-

-lin laser conﬁguration in 3D, with the relative phases of the

beams set to zero. The positive-frequency component of the electric ﬁeld is

With these coeﬃcients, along with parameters appropriate to the particular atom under

consideration, the atom-laser raising and lowering operators given in Eqs. (14) and (15) can

be constructed. With knowledge of the eﬀective Hamiltonian and the raising and lowering

operators, we can then proceed with the MCWF procedure as outlined.

Our example entails propagating 20 stochastic wave functions each for three diﬀerent

values of the light-shift parameter, ~

s3/(2Erec) =10, 20, and 30, for both 25Mg (I = 5/2)

and 87Sr (I = 9/2). We consider only δ3 =

5γ. As in Figure 2, we calculate the stochastic

trajectories of the ensemble average (i.e., averaged over the 20 wave functions) kinetic energy

for each atom as a function of time. We continue this propagation until the transient regime

has been passed for some time, and use the time average over the steady-state ensemble-

average kinetic energy to provide an estimate of the total average kinetic energy. The results

comparison, Je = Jg + 1 with Jg =1, 2, 3, and 4, with detuning δ =

5γ, as ﬁrst calculated

by Castin and Mølmer in Ref. [9]. From this cursory analysis, we can see that 25Mg should

−

exhibit a sharp rise in temperature with increasing laser intensity, while 87Sr will cool to sub-

Doppler temperatures even for higher intensities, as has been noted experimentally [10]. In

a future publication we plan to expand upon these initial results and present comprehensive

predictions of laser cooling temperatures for a variety of atoms.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have provided a detailed description of the fully quantum-mechanical

master equation that describes an atom with multiple internal internal structure interacting

with a 3D polarization-gradient laser ﬁeld. We have shown how the spontaneous-emission

relaxation operator is generalized for atoms of this type. The MCWF technique has been

applied to these equations of motion, providing a more eﬃcient means of performing calcu-

lations for these systems. A few example calculations have been provided to illustrate the

14

application of this theory to atomic systems interacting with laser conﬁgurations commonly

used in experiments. We intend to expand upon this work in a future publication and pro-

vide a comprehensive survey of laser cooling calculations for atoms with multilevel internal

structure.

APPENDIX: RELAXATION OPERATOR FOR AN ATOM WITH MULTIPLE

EXCITED-STATE HYPERFINE MANIFOLDS

In this appendix, we provide a detailed derivation of the spontaneous-emission relaxation

operator for an atom with multiple hyperﬁne excited-state manifolds. We will work within

the framework of the theory of system-reservoir interactions and follow the notation of

Ref. [25]. We consider an atom coupled to a vacuum radiation ﬁeld. The atom is then the

system, while the radiation ﬁeld is the reservoir. The total Hamiltonian is then given by

H = HA + HR + VA−R,

(A.1)

where HA and HR are the atom and reservoir bare Hamiltonians, respectively, and VA−R is

the coupling between the two. We will describe the interaction within the electric-dipole

approximation,

(A.2)

where D is the electric dipole operator for the atom, and E is the electric-ﬁeld operator

for the photon ﬁeld. We have expanded the interaction into its spherical components and

inserted the explicit quantum-mechanical form of the radiation ﬁeld, quantized in a box, in

terms of raising and lowering operators, a† and a, respectively. The sum over i indicates a

15

sum over ﬁeld modes, and for each ki, there are two mutually perpendicular polarization

vectors ˆǫ(i). To simplify the formalism, we will begin by ignoring the atomic CM and setting

the position coordinate to be the origin, R = 0. At the end we will then generalize the

equations to include the CM degree of freedom.

In general, the total density operator ρ evolves according to the Liouville equation,

˙ρ(t) =

i
~ [ρ(t), H] .

(A.3)

We can then make the standard approximations in system-reservoir theory, i.e., that the

reservoir is unaﬀected by the interactions with the system, and that the reservoir has a short

memory (the Markov approximation). With these assumptions, we arrive at an equation

of motion for the reduced density operator of the system σ = TrRρ with temporal coarse

graining on a time scale much larger than the time scale of reservoir ﬂuctuations but shorter

than the time scale of evolution of the system (see, for example, Refs. [14] and [25]),

have added a trivial summation index that will be useful later when combining the various

sub-density-matrix decay terms.

It is important to mention here that the indices on the frequencies in the exponentials are
correct in the above equation. The frequency ω(i)
0
appear in the exponential in the second term, while ω(j)

(not the summation index) should only

0 ’s (the summation index) should

appear in all of the other terms. The second term and the fourth term are both non-secular,

since they involve density-matrix elements σgei, and thus these terms can be neglected. The
third term is anti-resonant, i.e., it will contribute delta functions with arguments ω + ω(i)
0

We will now include the atomic CM dependence that we have been ignoring since the

beginning. This amounts to adding an integral over momentum states in 3D that should

have been included when we inserted atomic projection operators. Including this, the full

relaxation operator takes the form shown in Eq. (4).

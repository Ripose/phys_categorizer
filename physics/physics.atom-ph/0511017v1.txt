An approximate analytical solution of the Thomas-Fermi equation for neutral atoms is obtained,
using the Ritz variational method, which reproduces accurately the numerical solution, in the range
0 ≤ x ≤ 50, and its derivative at x = 0. The proposed solution is used to calculate the total
ionization energies of heavy atoms. The obtained results are in good agreement with the Hartree-
Fock ones and better than those obtained from previously proposed trial functions by other authors.

INTRODUCTION

Since the ﬁrst works of Thomas and Fermi [1], there
have been many attempts to construct an approximate
analytical solution of the Thomas-Fermi equation for
atoms [1]. E.Roberts [2] suggested a one-parameter trial
function:

where η = 1.905 and Csavinsky [3] has proposed a two-
parameters trial function:

φ2(x) = (a0e−

α0x + b0e−

2
β0x)

,

where a0 = 0.7218337, α0 = 0.1782559, b0 = 0.2781663
and β0 = 1.759339. Later, Kesarwani and Varshni [4]
have suggested:

φ3 = (ae−

αx + be−

βx + ce−

γx)2,

(3)

where a = 0.52495, α = 0.12062, b = 0.43505, β =
0.84795, c = 0.04 and γ = 6.7469. The equations (2) and
(3) are obtained by making use of an equivalent Firsov’s
variational principle [5]. The equation (1) has been mod-
iﬁed by Wu [6] in the following form:

φ4 = (1 + m√x + nx)2e−

m√x,

where m = 1.14837 and n = 4.0187.10−
Desaix et al.[7] have proposed the following expression:

φ5 =

(1 + (kx)β )α ,

(5)

where k = 0.4835, α = 2.098 and β = 0.9238. More-
over, other attempts have been conducted to solve this
problem [8, 10]. But, all of these proposed trial func-
tions cannot reproduce well the numerical solution of the
Thomas-Fermi equation [11] and its derivative at x = 0.
They didn’t prove eﬃcient when used to calculate the to-
tal ionization energy of heavy atoms. In the present work,

∗Electronic address: oulne@ucam.ac.ma

we propose a new trial function, constructed on the ba-
sis of the Wu [6] function, which reproduces correctly the
numerical solution of the Thomas-Fermi equation [11]. It
also gives more precise results for the total ionization en-
ergies of heavy atoms in comparison with the previously
proposed approximate solutions.

The Thomas-Fermi method consists in considering
that all electrons of an atom are subject to the same
conditions: each electron, subject to the energy conser-
vation law, has a potential energy eΦ(r) where Φ(r) is the
mean value of the potential owed to the nucleus and all
other electrons. The electronic charge density ρ(r) and
the potential Φ(r) are related via the Poisson equation:

d2
dr2 (rΦ(r)) =

1
r

−

4πρ(r),

assuming that ρ(r) and Φ(r) are spherically symmetric.
The energy conservation law applied to an electron in the
atom gives the following relation:

p2
2m −

eΦ(r) = E,

From the equation (7), we can obtain the maximum of
the electron impulsion:

p =

2meΦ(r),

where Φ(r) has to satisfy the boundary conditions:

Φ(R) = 0,

where R is the radius of a sphere representing the atom.
By considering that the contribution of the electrons sit-
uated near the nucleus to the potential Φ(r) is null, we
obtain another boundary condition:

The electronic charge density is deﬁned by the relation:

where p is the electron impulsion and h the Planck’s con-

the following expression for the charge density:

from the nucleus. With these changes, we get from
the equations (6) and (13) the diﬀerential equation of
Thomas-Fermi [1]:

leads to the Thomas-Fermi equation (14). While solv-
ing the Thomas-Fermi problem by using the variational
principle, we can assume an inﬁnite number of trial func-
tions which depend on diﬀerent variational parameters.

In this paper, we propose a trial function which depends
on three parameters α, β and γ:

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

After inserting the equation (21) into the equations
(19) and (18), the lagrangian L(φ) transforms into an al-
gebraic function L(α, β, γ) of the variational parameters
α, β and γ and the Thomas-Fermi problem turns into
minimizing L(α, β, γ) with respect to these parameters
subject to the constraint (17) which is taken into account
through a Lagrange multiplier. All calculations, in this
work, are performed with the software Maple Release 9.

III. RESULTS

The optimum values of the variational parameters α,
β and γ, obtained by minimizing the lagrangian (18)
taking into account the subsidiary condition (17), are
respectively equal to 0.7280642371, -0.5430794693 and
0.3612163121. The obtained trial function (Eq.(21)),
with these universal parameters, reproduces accurately
the numerical solution [11] of the Thomas-Fermi equa-
tion (14), in the range 0
50, in comparison with
x
the equations (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) as it is shown in
Fig. 1 and Tab. I. The mean error of our calculations,
with respect to the numerical solution, is about 2 % ,
while the other calculations have a mean error greater

than 2 %, while the equations (1), (2), (3) and (4) give
a result with an error greater than 11 % with respect to
the numerical derivative and the Eq.(5) has an inﬁnite
derivative at x = 0.

To test the eﬃciency of the diﬀerent trial functions,
given by the equations (1), (2), (3), (4) and (21), we have
calculated the total ionization energy of heavy atoms fol-
lowing the relation [12]:

in hartrees (e2/aB) and the obtained results, presented
II, are compared with those of Hartree-Fock
in Tab.
(HF) [13]. The Eq.(5) cannot be used because of its
inﬁnite derivative at x = 0. From Tab. II, one can see
that our results are fairly better than those obtained
from the Eqs.(1), (2), (3) and (4). The precision of our
calculations rises with the atomic number Z, on the
contrary of the other calculations performed with the
Eqs.(1), (2), (3) and (4), so our trial function is more
suited for heavy atoms.

In the main region of the screening potential of
Thomas-Fermi (0

precise than all other proposed functions as one can see
from Fig. 2 and Tab. I. The mean error of our calcula-
tions, in this region, is equal to 0.28 %, while the Eq.(2)

The proposed new trial function (Eq.(21)) provides a
more satisfactory approximation for the solution of the
Thomas-Fermi equation for neutral atoms than all other
previousely proposed analytical solutions. The results
obtained for the total ionization energies of heavy atoms
agree with the Hartree-Fock data and are more precise
than those calculated with the Eqs.(1), (2), (3) and (4).
The proposed solution (Eq.(21)) can be used to calculate,
with high precision, other atomic characteristics of heavy
atoms.

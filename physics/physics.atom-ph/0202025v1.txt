Abstract. The Schwinger equations of QED are rewritten in three diﬀerent ways as integral equations
involving functional derivatives, which are called weak ﬁeld, strong ﬁeld, and SCF quantum electrodynam-
ics. The perturbative solutions of these equations are given in terms of appropriate Feynman diagrams.
The Green function that is used as an electron propagator in each case is discussed in detail. The general
renormalization rules for each of the three equations are provided both in a non perturbative way (Dyson
relations) and for Feynman diagrams.

1 Introduction

This paper is a step towards the calculation of photon
and electron spectroscopies of matter based on quantum
electrodynamics.

Starting from quantum electrodynamics, which is a
most accurate and successful theory, garanties that the ba-
sis of the calculation is sound. Although such an approach
may look too true to be beautiful, it seems adequate be-
cause of experimental and theoretical reasons. From the
experimental point of view, spectroscopy has made huge
advances and is now able to measure tiny eﬀects. From the
theoretical point of view, relativistic methods have proved
very powerful, even for problems that do no look obvi-
ously relativistic. For instance, relativistic density func-
tional theory [1],[2] does not meet the nonuniqueness prob-
lem of spin-density functional theory [3]. Moreover, rela-
tivistic quantum ﬁeld theory is a safe framework to go
beyond the present LDA methods, especially when deal-
ing with excitations.

There are many presentations of QED. We ﬁrst have to
choose the version which is most convenient for solid-state
physics. The main three formalisms used in textbooks are
the quantum ﬁeld, path integrals and Schr¨odinger rep-
resentations [4]. The quantum ﬁeld and Schr¨odinger ap-
proaches manipulate operator-valued distributions [5] and
the path integral approach uses ill-deﬁned measures. There-
fore, we prefer to use Schwinger’s idea Ref.[6] of working
directly with Green functions which are given as solutions
of equations involving functional derivatives.

This approach has the mathematical advantage of ma-
nipulating standard distributions, and the physical advan-
tage of using only measurable quantities, or the more mea-
surable ones.

The standard approach to QED comes clearly from
particle physics, where the S matrix is most useful, and
where in and out states of the scattering experiments
are well deﬁned. In solid state physics, measurements are
usually based on a diﬀerent principle. The spectroscopist
shines on the sample a beam of electrons or photons com-
ing from a classical source. By classical we mean that the
source is not inﬂuenced by the system being measured.
After its interaction with the sample, another beam of
electrons or photons is measured. Many spectroscopies
can be described within this framework: photoemission,
electron scattering, photon scattering, inelastic scattering,
BIS, LEED, RHEED, x-ray absorption, UV/visible spec-
troscopies, etc. We try to stick as much as possible to this
experimental point of view.

We describe the photon ﬁeld with the electromagnetic
potential (which is not directly measurable but can be
calculated in a given gauge from the measurable elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds) and the photon Green function
(from which the photon energy density can be computed).
We describe the electron ﬁeld with the one-particle Green
function. This is also not directly measurable, but many
diagonal matrix elements of the Green function can be
measured (e.g. the electronic charge and current densi-
ties).

For applications to the spectroscopy of matter, we need
to formulate QED with an external ﬁeld. This external
ﬁeld is made of the potential due to the nuclei, to mag-
netic or electric ﬁelds applied to the sample and to ex-
ternal light sources. After this introduction, we start with
the deﬁnition of the notation used for the Green functions
and the QED Lagrangian. Then, we derive the Schwinger
equations for the electromagnetic potential and the elec-
tron propagator. These equations are solved iteratively us-

Christian Brouder: Renormalization of QED in an external ﬁeld

ing three diﬀerent methods (weak ﬁeld, strong ﬁeld, self-
consistent ﬁeld). The boundary conditions, such as the
number of electrons in the system, are determined by the
unperturbed Green function which is discussed in detail.
The proper deﬁnition of the current is established through
the use of a bilocal operator. Then we describe the renor-
malization of QED in an external ﬁeld. The non perturba-
tive Dyson relations are given to express the relation be-
tween bare and renormalized Green functions. The renor-
malization rules for Feynman diagrams are discussed.

The following assumptions are made in the present pa-
per: the external ﬁeld is weak enough not to create charges
(this is true for all stable atomic nuclei [7]) and the ex-
ternal ﬁeld is zero at inﬁnity (we exclude constant electric
and magnetic ﬁeld, for which specialized monographs are
available [8],[9]). Moreover, we do not consider IR diver-
gences.

body theory, it will be useful to write the QED Lagrangian
in SI units [16].

We have x0 = ct, we deﬁne the 4-current J α = (ρ, J/c),

and the 4-potential Aα = (V, cA).

2.3 Dimensions

The following table gives the SI units of the quantities used
in the paper, in a space-time with dimensions d (d = 4).

3 Derivation of the functional equations

The Schwinger equations were presented in Ref.[6], and
various derivations of them are available [17], [18] (p. 416-
32) and [10] (p. 475-81). Our derivation follows Ref.[10].
We deﬁne a generating function Z = Z(j, η, ¯η), where
the photon source jµ(x) and the anticommuting electron
sources η(x) and ¯η(x) enter the total action as [10]

σ = I

− Z

dx jµ(x)Aµ(x) +

dx ¯η(x)ψ(x) + ¯ψ(x)η(x),

Z

dx

where I =
(x). The minus sign before jµ(x) in the
deﬁnition of σ was chosen so that jµ(x) is a standard elec-
tromagnetic current. It is the opposite of the convention
used in Ref.[10].

L

R

The generating function can be written, up to a nor-

malization factor, as a path integral ([10] p.476)

Similarly, we shall use

Z

T ψα(x) ¯ψβ (y)

h

=

−

.

Finally, the following property will be essential

=

ψ(x)

h

¯ψ(x)

h
These equations are derived from the fact that the ground
state of the system is an eigenstate of the charge. If Q is
the charge operator, then [Q, ψ(x)] =
ψ(x) ([10] p.147),
thus

More physically, no anticommuting operator is measur-
able, only products of an even number of anticommuting
operators can be observed. It may be stressed that the
mean values of ψ(x) and ¯ψ(x) are zero only when the (un-
physical) electron sources η(x) and ¯η(x) are set to zero.

3.1 The photon equation

To derive the Schwinger equations we use the fact that
the derivative of an integral is zero (assuming that the
integrand is zero at inﬁnity):

Z(j, ¯η, η) =

(A, ψ, ¯ψ)eiσ/~c,

(1)

Z D

(A, ψ, ¯ψ)

Z D

δeiσ/~c
δAµ(x)

= 0.

or as the mean value of an operator ([10] p.210, 261)

Thus

I)/~c

T exp
h

Z(j, ¯η, η) =

i(σ
(cid:0)
It is also possible to write Z(j, ¯η, η) in terms of a
Z0(j, ¯η, η) without interaction [10] p. 445 and [19] p.246.
Anyway, we do not calculate Z, we only need it to calcu-
late mean values of Heisenberg operators. For instance

Christian Brouder: Renormalization of QED in an external ﬁeld

According to the method of generating functions, a
factor Aν (x) in the integral can be replaced by a func-
tional derivative of Z with respect to jν(x) (up to a factor
i~c). This is what we did for Eq.(2). In the case of an-
ticommuting variables such as ψ(x) we must be a little
more careful. Functional derivative with respect to an an-
ticommuting source is very similar to that with respect
to a function. The diﬀerence can be summarized in the
identity

When the external electron sources η and ¯η are set to
zero, we showed that ψ(x) = ¯ψ(x) = 0, and we obtain our
ﬁrst basic equation

It is a bit clumsy to use an electron source η(x) just
to conclude that no such source exists which leads to the
cancelation of ψ(x) and ¯ψ(x). The way out of this diﬃculty
is to use Rochev’s bilocal source η(x, y) [20].

Thus, each factor ψ(x) (resp. ¯ψ(x)) in the path integral
is replaced by a functional derivative of Z with respect to
¯η(x) (resp. η(x)). Paying attention to the signs and the
factors ~c/i we can rewrite Eq.(3) as

In this section, we derive various integral equations which
correspond to the diﬀerential equations of the previous
section.

When the external potential is weak, we can multiply
Eq.(15) by the free electron Green function S0(x, y). This
gives us the following coupled equations

Strong ﬁeld QED was reviewed recently in Ref. [22].

but the nuclear potential is not screened.

4.3 SCF external potential

Finally, the most accurate results are obtained when the
external ﬁeld is taken as the complete vector potential
Aµ(x), which is determined by a self-consistent ﬁeld pro-
cedure. Therefore, the potential that will be used in the
initial Green function is Aµ(x) instead of aµ(x). This cal-
culation can be found in Refs.[18] and [10] p.479.

This equation, together with Eq.(19) and Eq.(14) are a

As compared to the case of a strong external poten-
tial, the SCF potential has the advantage of taking into
account the electrons in the system. Thus, the nuclear po-
tentials are screened by the electrons in a self-consistent
way. All the tadpoles of strong ﬁeld QED have been re-
summed.

This formulation of QED is closer to the standard
methods of solid state physics or quantum chemistry. It
was used in nuclear physics under the name Hartree QED
when the current is calculated by a single electron loop
[23], see also [24].

5 The initial Green function

Once the functional equation is know, it remains to specify
the boundary conditions. For example, we can specify the
Green function without interaction. In the case of a static
external ﬁeld aµ(r) or a static self-consistent ﬁeld Aµ(r),
this Green function is well-known and can be written

G0

N (x, y) = iθ(y0

XEn>EF

ψn(x) ¯ψn(y),

(22)

where EF is the Fermi energy, and where ψn(x) is the
solution of the Dirac equation at energy En. Note that
N (x, y) = ~cSA
N (x, y) = ~cSa
N (x, y) or G0
G0
N (x, y) where
Sa
N (x, y) and SA
N (x, y) are the Feynman electron Green
functions in the external potential aµ(x) or Aµ(x) (with
N occupied bound states). In the present section, we want
to discuss and justify this expression.

The notation follows standard textbooks on the Dirac
equation [10],[27]. The index N means that G0
N (x, y) is
the Green function for a total charge of N e. The Green
function G0
0(x, y) represents the vacuum in the presence
of aµ(x) (or Aµ(x)). This vacuum Green function is given
by Eq.(22) for EF = 0. The diﬀerence between G0
N (x, y)
and G0

0(x, y) is

5.1 Early works

To understand the origin of the Green function given by
Eq.(22), it is useful to describe how it appeared histori-
cally.

In the vacuum, Dirac [28],[29] assumed that all the
negative-energy states are ﬁlled. This gives the density
matrix

ρ(x, y) =

ψ0
n(x)ψ0
n

†

(y),

XEn<0

where ψ0
n(x) is the free solution of the Dirac equation
for energy En. However, such a density matrix would be
highly impractical, since it would lead to an inﬁnite charge
density. In a strike of genius, Dirac made the following
observation [28],[29]. Since

is less singular. The physical idea developed by Dirac is to
measure the charge density with respect to charge den-
sity of the vacuum ρ0(x). The induced charge density
= 0 in the presence of an external potential was in-
ρ(x)
vestigated in the thirties [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. The po-
tential corresponding to this induced charge is called the
Uehling potential [33]. Physically, ρ(x)
= 0 is a reaction of
the vacuum which is polarized by the external potential.
The induced charge has observable consequences. For in-
stance, its eﬀect on the energy levels of hydrogen atoms is
well documented [22]. Computer programs are available to
evaluate the Uehling potential for general nuclear charge
models [34]. Expansions in (Zα)n where investigated in
[35].

where the last equality is due to charge conjugation sym-
metry.

In the presence of a static potential aµ(x) or Aµ(x),
and without bound states, the analogous density matrix
is

ρ(x, y) =

potential, but we still have that

This is indeed the density obtained by Dirac. One

many-body charge density (or the non-relativistic one),
which is obtained by summing over the occupied states

the contribution of the Green function G0

The right hand side is the familiar expression for ρ(x). It is
not strictly correct, since it neglects the eﬀect of G0
0(x, x),
which describes the polarisation of the vacuum by the ex-
ternal potential (i.e. the Uehling potential, see Ref.[10] p.
327 or Ref.[22] p.265). It might seem strange that the QED
and the many-body densities are diﬀerent, since they are
given by the same equation

ρ(x) =

ie
2π Z

−

∞

−∞

dω tr[γ0G0

N (x, x; ω)].

by

The reason for this discrepancy is that the expression for
ρ(x) is divergent, and the diﬀerence comes from a dif-
ferent renormalization of it. In the many-body case, an
innocent-looking convergence factor eiωη is introduced in
the integral over ω (see Ref.[36] p.124), which selects pre-
EF (the states En < 0 are discarded
cisely the states En ≤
from the start). On the other hand, in the QED case, the
integration contour is below the real axis from
to EF
and above it from EF to

−∞

Several approximations are possible (no-sea, no-pair).

They are discussed in Refs.[37], [38].

5.3 Subsequent works

This idea of a Dirac sea in an external potential has re-
ceived many experimental and theoretical conﬁrmations.
The ﬁrst and strongest one being the discovery of the
positron.

Since then, the Dirac sea and Eq.(22) were used as a
basis for strong ﬁeld electrodynamics [7], [39], [40], [41], for
thermal ﬁeld theory [42], [43], [44], [45], and for relativis-
tic quantum many-body theory in Riemannian spacetime
[46].

The concept of a Dirac sea is sometimes considered to
be rather out of date. However, according to Jackiw [47],
it is still the best physical picture to understand striking

phenomena such as chiral anomalies [48] and fractional
fermion numbers [49].

The case when the Fermi energy is degenerate will not

be considered in this paper.

6 The induced current

It is important to derive the proper expression of the four-
current as a function of the electron Green function. As a
ﬁeld operator, the current must be self-adjoint (it is mea-
surable), conserved, gauge invariant and should change
sign under charge conjugation.

6.1 Deﬁnition

We follow Refs.[15], [50], [51] and deﬁne the bilocal ﬁeld
operator

Jµ(x, y) =

e
2 Xαβ

γµ
αβ

¯ψα(x)ψβ(y)
(cid:2)

ψβ(x) ¯ψα(y)
(cid:3)

.

−

When this operator is evaluated at the ground state
of the system, its value can be expressed in terms of the
electron Green function.

The Stueckelberg-Feynman Green functions that we
use in the present paper are deﬁned from the time-ordering
operator ([10] p.150)

T ψα(x) ¯ψβ(y) = θ(x0

We consider here the interacting ﬁelds and not the free
ﬁelds as in Ref.[10] p.272. Therefore, S(x, y) is the full
electron Green function.

= i~cSαβ(x, y).

(23)

To deﬁne the current we follow Schwinger’s prescrip-
tion [50]. Let z be a four-vector with z0 > 0, the four-
current is

J µ(x) =

γµS(x, x)],

−
where S(x, x) is deﬁned by the symmetric limit

When we compare this with the deﬁnition of the bilocal
current ﬁeld operator, we obtain

J µ(x) = lim

Jµ(x + z, x

Thus, when the deﬁnition of J µ(x) is written in terms of
the bilocal operator, the ﬁrst argument of the bilocal oper-
ator is always later than x. It is not clear that the current
deﬁned by Eq.(24) is real, as a measurable quantity should
be.

Now we prove that the current is real and transforms

properly under charge conjugation.

Moreover, if x and y are space-like separated, we can
rewrite the bilocal current in terms of ﬁeld commutators:

Jµ(x, y) =

Jµ(x, y) + Jµ(y, x)

The fact that the current J µ(x) deﬁned by Eq.(24)
is real can also be obtained directly from a property of
S(x, y). If z is a space-like vector, causality ensures that

Thus, we obtain, for space-like z

Using the deﬁnition ¯ψ = ψ†γ0, the bilocal operator can

Therefore, the sign of the bilocal current is reversed under
charge conjugation.

Now we investigate the behaviour of the current un-
der charge conjugation, when it is deﬁned in terms of the
Green function. To do this, we need an equation for the
Green function of the charge conjugated problem. We ob-
tain it by transposing both sides of Eq.(17). This trans-
position is meant for the 4x4 matrices only: ST
ss′ (x, y) =
Ss′s(x, y). Then we multiply both sides of the equation by
the charge conjugation matrix C on the left and C−1 on
the right. We use the property CγµT C−1 =
γµ and we
obtain

odd functions of A. Now, since the electron loops of QED
are generated by the current, and since the x in S(x, x; A)
is linked to another photon propagator, we see that the
electron loops with an odd number of photon lines are
zero. This is a version of Furry’s theorem for QED with
external ﬁeld. The relevance of charge conjugation for the
QED current was already noticed by Kramers in 1937 [54].
Related results can be found in Ref.[7], sections 4.2, 9.4
and 15.1.

Why symmetric? If a bilocal operator F (x, y) is antisym-
F (y, x)), then its value at x = y is
metric (i.e. F (x, y) =
y)2. Since
zero, except at divergences, such as (x
the regular part of F (x, y) is zero on the diagonal, the
use of a symmetric operator eliminates the antisymmet-
ric divergences without changing the value of the regular
operator on the diagonal.

6.5 Mass-reversal symmetry

The concept of mass-reversal symmetry was discussed by
Peaslee [55] and Tiomno [56]. For massless particles, mass-
reversal symmetry is known as chiral symmetry.

The mass-reversed fermion ﬁeld ψ(

m) satisﬁes the
same equations as the usual fermion ﬁeld ψ(m), but with
a reversed mass:

Since γµγ5 =
(up to a phase factor ηm which disappears in the Green
function). To see how the Green function transforms under
mass reversal, we multiply both sides of Eq.(13) by γ5 on
the left and on the right. The commutation rules between
γ5 and γµ yield

Thus, the induced current is even under mass-conjugation,
and the vector potential also, as expected [56].

In other words, the induced current is an even function

6.4 Charge conservation

Charge conservation is described by the equation ∂µJ µ(x) =
0. How does this translate for our bilocal operator? We
want a real and symmetric expression for ∂µJ µ(x) = 0.

attempts exist [1], [59], [39], [51], but none of them was
fully completed. We start now a renormalization of QED
in an external ﬁeld which closely follows the renormal-
ization of vacuum QED. The ﬁrst step is to determine
Dyson’s relations, which are non perturbative expressions
that link renormalized and non renormalized propagators
and ﬁelds. Then we give a non perturbative relation be-
tween the renormalized potential and the renormalized
vacuum polarization. Finally, we describe the renormal-
ization rules that enable us to obtain ﬁnite quantities for
any strong ﬁeld or SCF Feynman diagram.

7.1 Dyson relations for strong ﬁeld QED

The ﬁrst point is to determine the Dyson relations between
renormalized and unrenormalized propagators. This rela-
tion is given by Sterman[60] for scalar ﬁelds and we derive
it for QED. If we denote the renormalized quantities with
a overlined symbol, in the presence of an external poten-
tial aµ(x), Dyson’s relations are [61]

S(x, y; a; e0, m0) = Z2 ¯S(x, y;

Z3a; e, m),

Z3a; e, m),

Z3a; e, m).

aµ(z1) +

The Dyson relation for the vacuum propagator S(x, y; 0)
is S(x, y; 0) = Z2 ¯S(x, y; 0). For the other terms, the func-
tional derivative with respect to the external potential
brings a factor A(x) in the path integral. Therefore,

If we substitute S′(x+z, x

z) in the
deﬁnition of the current (24), we obtain a current which
is real, odd under charge conjugation and gauge invariant,
but charge conservation becomes doubtful. Thus, we stick
to the original deﬁnition Eq.(24).

Or, more precisely,

Because of this relation, we also deﬁne the renormal-
ized external potential as ¯aµ(x) = √Z3aµ(x). It may seem
strange that the external potential aµ(x) and the full po-
tential Aµ(x) are not renormalized with the same formula.
However, we must recall that aµ(x) was deﬁned in terms
of an external current jµ(x), which was used to generate
Green functions by functional derivatives. The bare Green
functions are generated by Aµ(x)jµ(x) and the renormal-
ized ones by ¯Aµ(x)¯µ(x). Since we want these two terms to

√Z3jµ(x) (see Refs.[60] p. 297 and [19] p.288). More phys-
ically, we can say that an external ﬁeld is made by prepar-
ing a certain density of (charged) matter n(x). Before
renormalization, this density corresponds to a charge den-
sity j0(x) = e0n(x). The renormalization modiﬁes the
charge, but not the density of matter. Thus the renor-
malized charge density is now ¯0(x) = en(x) = √Z3j0(x),
and the corresponding relation for the external potential
is again ¯aµ(x) = √Z3aµ(x).

In terms of the renormalized propagators, the func-
tional equation becomes (using e0 = e/√Z3 and m0 =
m + δm)

of fermion loops with one external photon line, which are
zero by Furry’s theorem).

The second term is also well known from the renor-

7.2 Dyson relations for SCF-QED

Notice that, in the case of SCF-QED, Dyson’s relations
are much simpler, because e0A = e ¯A:

S(x, y; e0A; e0, m0) = Z2 ¯S(x, y; e ¯A; e, m),
D(x, y; e0A; e0, m0) = Z3 ¯D(x, y; e ¯A; e, m),
Z3 ¯A(x; e ¯A; e, m).

The main diﬀerence between vacuum QED and SCF-
QED is the renormalization of the induced vector poten-
tial. The total bare potential is

and the problem is the renormalization of tr[γνS(s, s)]. To
indicate that the electron Green function is calculated in
the presence of the full potential Aµ(x) we denote it by
S(x, y; A).

Dyson’s relation (35) gives us

tr[γνS(s, s; A)] = Z2tr[γν ¯S(s, s; ¯A)].

We rewrite the right hand side using Eq.(51):

tr[γν ¯S(s, s; ¯A)] = tr[γν ¯S(s, s; 0)] +

It should be noticed that, in all our manipulations,
the renormalization factors Z2, Z3 and δm where taken
at ¯Aµ = 0. In other words, the renormalization factors of
QED with external ﬁeld are the same as the renormaliza-
tion factors of vacuum QED. More precisely, the vacuum
renormalization factors removes the divergences of QED
in external ﬁeld. However, renormalization conditions may
introduce ﬁnite diﬀerences between the renormalization
factors of vacuum QED and QED in an external ﬁeld.

From Eq. (40), it can be checked that ¯Π is indeed the
renormalized vacuum polarization. If we write Xµ(x) for

8 Weak ﬁeld renormalization

In this section, we give the renormalization rules of vac-
uum QED, which are valid for weak ﬁeld renormalization.
We repeat some of the rules given in [62] for complete-
ness, and because we work now in the direct space (and
not in the Fourier space). The ﬁrst set of rules is equivalent
to Zimmermann’s forest formula for the removal of subdi-
vergences. The second set of rules subtracts the superﬁcial
divergences.

8.1 Removal of subdivergences

If Γ is a Feynman diagram, and U (Γ ) is the regularized
value of the diagram as a function of external momenta
and masses and regularization parameters, then the value
of the diagram with subdivergences subtracted is ¯R(Γ )
deﬁned by [10], [63]

¯R(Γ ) = U (Γ ) +

γ(i), γ′

(i′), . . .

).

}

U (Γ/

{

×

(42)

In this expression, the sum runs over all sets of disjoint
renormalization parts of Γ . A renormalization part γ of Γ
is a one-particle irreducible (1PI) subgraph of Γ , diﬀerent
from Γ itself, such that γ has two or three (amputated)
external lines. A diagram is 1PI when it is connected and
cannot be disconnected by cutting through any of its inter-
nal lines. Two renormalization parts γ and γ′ are disjoint
if they have no vertex in common.

There are three types of renormalization part: self-
energy 1PI diagrams (i.e. 1PI diagrams with two am-
puted external electron lines), vacuum polarization 1PI
diagrams (i.e. 1PI diagrams with two amputed external
photon lines) and reduced vertex 1PI diagrams (i.e. 1PI
diagrams with two amputed external electron lines and
one amputed external photon line). The index (i) depends
on the type of the renormalization part. If γ is a self energy
1PI diagram then i is 0 or 2, if γ is a vacuum polariza-
tion 1PI diagram then i is 3, if γ is a reduced vertex 1PI
diagram then i is 1.

Finally let us deﬁne Γ/

. We start by the
deﬁnition of Γ/γ(i). It varies with the type of renormal-
ization part and with the index (i).

(i′), . . .

{

}

γ(i), γ′

If γ is a self-energy 1PI diagram, then i can be 0 or
2. If the complete diagram is Γ and γ a self-energy 1PI

subdiagram of Γ , then in the term Γ/γ(0), the 1PI diagram
γ is replaced by a point and in the term Γ/γ(2) the 1PI
diagram γ is replaced by a free electron line.

If γ is a vacuum polarization 1PI diagram, then i is 3. If
the complete diagram is Γ and γ is a vacuum polarization
1PI subdiagram of Γ , then in the term Γ/γ(3), the 1PI
diagram γ is replaced by a free photon propagator.

γ(i), γ′

If γ is a reduced vertex 1PI diagram, then i is 1. If
the complete diagram is Γ and γ is a reduced vertex
1PI diagram, then in the term Γ/γ(1), the vertex dia-
gram is replaced by a point. The terms Γ/
}
are then deﬁned recursively. For instance, to deﬁne Γ ′′ =
, we ﬁrst put Γ ′ = Γ/γ(i), so that Γ ′′ =
Γ/
{
Γ ′/γ′

γ(i), γ′
(i′).
We insist here on the fact that the removal of subdi-
vergences given by Eq.(42) is valid for any (connected or
disconnected) Feynman diagram. It is the expression, for
each diagram, of Dyson’s relations. The reason why the
counterterms C1(γ) are required, although Z2 = Z1, is
explained in [62].

{

In Eq.(42) all counterterms Ci(γ) are assumed to be
known from the renormalization of the superﬁcial diver-
gence of the subdiagram γ.

8.2 Superﬁcial divergences

In the second step, we determine the counterterms Ci(Γ )
of the divergent graph Γ . If the diagram Γ is not 1PI,
the counterterms Ci(Γ ) are zero. If Γ is 1PI, we must
distinguish three cases. A self-energy diagram is linearly
divergent, thus we must remove two terms. From Lorentz
covariance, we can write the renormalized value of the
diagram Γ as

R(Γ ; x, y) = ¯R(Γ ; x, y) + C0(Γ )c2δ(x
+C2(Γ )S0−1

(x, y).

y)

−

(43)

A vacuum polarization diagram is quadratically diver-
gent, thus we should have to remove three terms. However,
Lorentz covariance and the Ward identities for the pho-
ton propagators cancel the ﬁrst two counterterms, and the
renormalized value of Γ is

Rµν (Γ ; x, y) = ¯Rµν(Γ ; x, y) + C3(Γ )D0−1

µν (x, y). (44)

Finally, a reduced vertex diagram is logarithmically diver-
gent, and its renormalized value is

R(Γ ; x, y; λ, z) = ¯R(Γ ; x, y; λ, z)

+C1(Γ )γλδ(x

y)δ(y

z).

The inﬁnite constants Ci(Γ ) are determined from the renor-
malization conditions.

where Γj is the vertex diagram obtained by branching a
photon line on the j-th free electron propagator of the
self-energy diagram Γ .

Since the renormalization of weak ﬁeld QED is exactly
the same as the renormalization of vacuum QED, we refer
the reader to Refs.[10] and [62] for examples.

9 Strong ﬁeld renormalization

For the strong ﬁeld renormalization, the removal of sub-
divergences is again given by Eq.(42), which is a purely
algebraic identity related to the Hopf algebra structure of
renormalization [64], [65].

According to the general strategy of renormalization,
the non-renormalized diagrams are evaluated in terms of
renormalized electron propagators. In vacuum QED, the
mass m used in the free electron propagator is ﬁnite, it is
not the inﬁnite mass m0 of the bare free electron propa-
gator. Similarly, the charge and the potential used in the
basic electron propagator of strong ﬁeld QED are ﬁnite.

To remove the superﬁcial divergences we start by ex-
amining all possible superﬁcially divergent diagrams (Chap-
ter 8 of Ref.[10]). A priori, the superﬁcially divergent 1PI
diagrams are the self-energy and vertex diagrams, and the
1PI diagrams with one external photon (tadpole), two ex-
ternal photon (vacuum polarization), three external pho-
tons and four external photons (scattering of light by
light).

9.1 Self-energy and vertex diagrams

The total counterterms for the strong ﬁeld diagram Γ are
obtained by adding the counterterms for Γ ′ and Γ ′
1. From
the relation (46) between C1(Γ ′
1) and C2(Γ ′) we obtain
for the strong ﬁeld self-energy diagrams

R(Γ ; x, y) = ¯R(Γ ; x, y) + C0(Γ )c2δ(x
+C2(Γ )(S0−1

(47)

where C0(Γ ) = C0(Γ ′) and C2(Γ ) = C2(Γ ′). Therefore,
the strong ﬁeld self-energy diagrams are renormalized with
the same formula as the vacuum diagrams, the countert-
erms C0(Γ ) and C1(Γ ) are the same as for the vacuum
case, the only diﬀerence is that the free propagator S0 is
replaced by the strong ﬁeld propagator Sa. More precisely,
the counterterms are the same as those of vacuum QED if
the renormalization conditions are compatible. Otherwise,
their diﬀerence is ﬁnite.

For a general strong ﬁeld self-energy diagram Γ , the
proof is similar. The subdivergences are removed with for-
mula (42). The same Born expansion is made. The ﬁrst
diagram Γ ′ is now the diagram Γ (with subtracted sub-
divergences) where all strong ﬁeld electron propagators
Sa are replaced by free electron propagators S0, and Γ ′
j
is the diagram obtained by adding a photon line to the
j-th electron line of Γ ′. The remaining diagrams are ﬁ-
nite by power counting. The superﬁcial divergences of Γ ′
and Γ ′
j are removed by the vacuum QED renormalization
prescription, and we ﬁnd Eq.(47) again.

For a strong ﬁeld vertex diagram, we have a logarith-
mic divergence and the result is exactly the same as for
vacuum QED:

To renormalize self-energy diagrams, we take the exam-
ple of the one-loop diagram, and we expand the electron
propagator using the Born expansion ([66] p.572)

The strong ﬁeld diagram on the left hand side is denoted
Γ . The ﬁrst diagram on the right hand side (denoted Γ ′) is
a self-energy diagram of vacuum QED, the second diagram
(denoted Γ ′
1) is a vertex diagram of vacuum QED and the
third diagram is ﬁnite by power counting. Using Eq.(43),
the counterterms for Γ ′ are

R(Γ ′; x, y) = ¯R(Γ ′; x, y) + C0(Γ ′)c2δ(x
+C2(Γ ′)S0−1

(x, y),

y)

−

We still have the subdivergence-subtracted 1PI diagrams
with one, two, three or four external photon lines (and no
external electron line). If the diagram has three or four
external photon lines, then it is ﬁnite. To prove this, we
expand the strong ﬁeld electron propagator using the Born
expansion. Then we are back to the case of vacuum QED,
where we know that a 1PI diagram with three external
photon lines is zero and a 1PI with four external photon
lines is ﬁnite [10] (once subdivergences are subracted). A
1PI diagram with two external photon lines is a vacuum

Christian Brouder: Renormalization of QED in an external ﬁeld

polarization diagram, which is renormalized as for vacuum
QED with Eq.(44)

Similar equations can be found in [66] p. 552, [59].

Therefore, the counterterm for the tadpole diagram Γ

Rµν (Γ ; x, y) = ¯Rµν (Γ ; x, y) + C3(Γ )D0−1

µν (x, y), (49)

is

where C3(Γ ) has the same value as for the corresponding
vacuum QED diagram, up to a possible ﬁnite quantity.

−

Now comes the diagram which is really typical of QED
with external ﬁeld: the tadpole. The induced vector po-
tential Aµ(x)
¯aµ(x) is given by the sum of all tadpole
diagrams Γ . In vacuum QED, the induced vector poten-
tial is zero and the tadpoles do not intervene. For the case
of QED with an external ﬁeld, once subdivergences are
removed, the tadpole has a cubic superﬁcial divergence.
But because of Furry’s theorem (i.e. of the fact that the
current is odd under charge conjugation), the only diver-
gence that remains is the same as for vacuum polarization.
We illustrate the general procedure with the simplest ex-
ample (see also [22]). By using the Born expansion for S ¯a
we obtain

)

*

Furry’s theorem eliminates electron loops with one and
three external photon lines (the ﬁrst and the third dia-
grams on the right hand side). More precisely, since the
induced current is an odd function of the external poten-
tial, the ﬁrst and the third diagrams are not present on
the right hand side. The last diagram is ﬁnite, because
if we make a further Born expansion of S ¯a in it, we ob-
tain a vacuum photon-photon scattering diagram, which
is ﬁnite, plus a diagram with ﬁve external photon lines,
which is ﬁnite by power counting. Therefore, the only di-
vergent diagram on the rhs is the second one, which is a
vacuum polarization diagram. We denote Γ ′
1 this vacuum
polarization diagram and Γ the strong ﬁeld tadpole on the
lhs.

We can write the bare potential as a sum of Feynman

diagrams

Aλ(x) = aλ(x) +

e|Γ |
0 Uλ(x; Γ ),

XΓ

Γ
|

where
is the number of vertices of the tadpole diagram
Γ . If Γ is the simple tadpole of the above example, our
discussion shows that its value is

|

Rλ(Γ ; x) = ¯Rλ(Γ ; x) + eC4(Γ )¯aλ(x),

where C4(Γ ) = C3(Γ ′

1).

For a general tadpole diagram Γ , the result is similar.
If ¯Rµ(Γ ; x) is the value of Γ when all subdivergences are
removed, the superﬁcial divergence is removed with the
counterterm

Rµ(Γ ; x) = ¯Rµ(Γ ; x) + eC4(Γ )¯aµ(x),

(50)

where

C4(Γ ) =

C3(Γi).

Xi

In the last relation, Γi is the vacuum polarization obtained
from the tadpole Γ by adding a photon line to the i-th
electron line of Γ and by transforming all electron lines
Sa into free electron lines S0 in the resulting diagram. In
other words, Γi is a vacuum QED vacuum polarization
diagram, and C3(Γi) the corresponding counterterm.

After this analysis, we obtain the following addition
to the description of the renormalization of vacuum QED.
There is now a new index i = 4 and new 1PI diagrams γ
which are tadpoles. In the term Γ/γ(4), the tadpole sub-

.

diagram γ(4) becomes an external potential line . .

9.3 Summary

In this section, we summarize the renormalization rules for
strong ﬁeld QED. For any strong ﬁeld Feynman diagram
Γ , the subdivergences are subtracted by applying the for-
est formula (42). The only diﬀerence with the weak ﬁeld
case is that the vacuum electron propagators are replaced
by strong ﬁeld electron propagators.

When the subdivergences are subtracted, the superﬁ-
cial divergence is treated as follows. If Γ is not 1PI, the
superﬁcial counterterms are zero. In particular, if Γ con-
tains tadpoles, then the counterterms Ci(Γ ) are zero. This
is because a tadpole inside Γ can always be disconnected
from Γ by cutting a photon line.

If Γ is 1PI, then the superﬁcial divergence is removed
using Eq.(47) for a self-energy and the indices are i = 0
and i = 2, Eq.(48) for a vertex and the index is i = 1,
Eq.(49) for a vacuum polarization with the index i = 3
and Eq.(50) for a tadpole with the index i = 4.

Now we give a few example to illustrate the general

Now, we introduce the counterterm of Γ ′

1 using Eq.(44),

and we obtain the renormalized induced potential

As far as we know, the renormalization rules for strong
ﬁeld QED are new. Therefore, a number of examples are
required to see how they work in practice.

The second diagram is not 1PI. To renormalize it, we
renormalize its two disjoint divergent subdiagrams: the
vacuum polarization diagram on the left (index i = 3)
and the tadpole on the right (index i = 4), and we multi-
ply the renormalized diagrams. The general rule for a non
1PI diagram Γ is the following: write Γ as a product of
1PI diagrams, renormalized each 1PI diagram, and multi-
ply the renormalized diagrams [18]. This rule is equivalent
to the forest formula (42) for non 1PI diagrams, because
renormalization parts belonging to diﬀerent 1PI subdia-
grams are disjoint.

For the last diagram, there are two subdivergences: on

Christian Brouder: Renormalization of QED in an external ﬁeld

Obviously, it is much simpler to renormalize directly
from the Dyson relation. However, this does not renormal-
ized all Feynman diagrams. Only the sum of them is ﬁnite,
as was discussed in [62]. In practice, all the Feynman dia-
grams of a certain order cannot always be calculated, and
it is necessary to renormalize each diagram separately.

9.5 Example 2: the self-energy

For QED in an external ﬁeld, the bare and renormalized
self-energies are deﬁned by

From Dyson’s relations between S and ¯S we obtain the
following relation between Σ and ¯Σ.

11 Renormalization conditions

The renormalization theory is an unambiguous method to
remove the subdivergences of a Feynman diagram. How-
ever, once all the subdivergences are removed, we must
still specify the value of the superﬁcial divergence. This
is done by giving renormalization conditions. In the case
of QED without external ﬁeld, these conditions are well-
known ([10] p. 413). However, for QED with external ﬁeld,
they have never been stated precisely. It is the lack of
proper renormalization conditions that yields the ambi-
guities in the results of Dosch and M¨uller [51]. There are
three kinds of renormalization conditions: for the current,
for the photon propagator and for the electron propaga-
tor. Some of them were investigated in the early days of
QED [33].

10 Self-consistent ﬁeld renormalization

The case of self-consistent QED is simpler, since we have
the same diagrams as for vacuum QED (with S0 replaced
by S ¯A). Therefore, the renormalization rules are the same,
except that the free fermion lines become the fermion lines
in the SCF potential ¯A(x).

Since there is no tadpole in the fermion propagator of
self-consistent QED, the only point which is delicate is the
renormalization of tadpoles to calculate the self-consistent
potential. When all subdivergences are removed, the su-
perﬁcial counterterm is obtained by expanding the SCF
potential in terms of strong ﬁeld diagrams and by renor-
malizing those. The result is

Rµ(x; Γ ) = ¯Rµ(x; Γ ) + eC4(Γ ) ¯Aµ(x).

Thus, the counterterm is proportional to the renormalized
potential itself.

The renormalization condition for the current is deduced
from the neutrality of matter. The total charge of a piece
of matter is the sum of the proton charges and the elec-
tron charges. Thus, the induced charge density due to the
vacuum polarization integrates to zero. If this were not
true, a piece of matter with an equal number of electrons
and protons would have a net charge.

In the case of strong ﬁeld QED, we operate the renor-
µν (x, y) and we

malization rule for tadpoles (50) with D0−1
obtain

dyD0−1

µν (x, y)R(Γ ; y, ν) =

dyD0−1

µν (x, y) ¯R(Γ ; y, ν)

Z

Z
+eC4(Γ )¯µ(x).

The left hand side represents the renormalized current in-
duced by the external current ¯µ(x). Two points must be
noticed here. Firstly, the superﬁcial divergence of the cur-
rent diagrams (tadpoles) are removed by a counterterm
proportional to the external current, and any induced cur-
rent proportional to the external current cannot be dis-
tinguished from a renormalization of the charge (see [66]
p.553). With some hindsight, this point can be recognized
in Ref.[67]. Secondly, the integral of the induced current
must be zero to ensure matter neutrality. Thus

dx

Z

Z

dyD0−1

µν (x, y)R(Γ ; y, ν) = 0

This second point was clearly made by Uehling [33]. When
the external current is not neutral, this is enough to de-
termine C4(Γ ).

In the case of self-consistent QED, the counterterm is
proportional to ¯A(x), and for a neutral atom the corre-
sponding ¯J(x) integrates to zero. Therefore, the criterium
of matter neutrality is not enough to determine the renor-
malized current of self-consistent QED.

11.2 The photon Green function

To specify a renormalization condition for the photon Green
function, we use the requirement that, very far from the
external ﬁeld, low frequency Compton scattering should
be given by the Thomson formula [66] p.640 and two
close charges should interact with a Coulomb potential
[66] p.670 and [10] p.325.

In other words, for very large x and y and small x

y,

¯Dµν(x, y) should tend to D0

µν(x, y).

Finally, it would be interesting for the spectroscopic
applications to generalize the Schwinger equations to a
degenerate “vacuum”. When the unperturbed state is de-
generate, we must consider not only a single matrix ele-
ment

11.3 The electron Green function

ditions do not seem to have been studied beyond vacuum
QED. One could probably assume that, for very large x

12 Conclusion

In this paper, the equations of self-consistent quantum
electrodynamics were derived from the Schwinger approach.
These equations are valid for any number of electrons in
the system and the functional derivative of the Green func-
tion in the presence of bound electrons was used to calcu-
late various perturbative solutions of the Schwinger equa-
tions.

An interesting application of self-consistent QED is to
see if the solitonic solutions of the Maxwell-Dirac equa-
tions [68] survive when the two loop interaction is turned
on. In other words, can an interacting electron be bound
by its own vacuum polarization ?

The general renormalization rules for strong ﬁeld QED
and self-consistent QED were given. Again, these rules are
valid also in the presence of bound electrons, because the
bound states do not modify the short-distance or large-
momentum asymptotics of the Green functions.

Much work remains to be done to transform QED
into a practical tool for solid-state or molecular calcula-
tions. We must investigate more fully the conditions of
renormalization. We should also be able to calculate the
energy-momentum tensor from the Green functions, as the
current was written in terms of the electron propagator.
Results in this direction were obtained by Engel and Drei-
zler [1], but much work remains to be done to reach an
all-order renormalization of the QED energy. The energy
is not the only physically interesting property and the in-
vestigation of the full energy-momentum tensor might be
interesting and might provide some physically reasonable
conditions of renormalization.

In this paper, we have only considered a coherent ex-
ternal source jµ(x). It is also possible to derive Schwinger
equations for a partially coherent source. The main appli-
cation of this extension is the eﬀect of temperature on an
electronic system.

In this appendix, we give the proof of equations that are
used in the text.

This is a very satisfactory result, which shows that the
perturbative solution of the Schwinger equation has the
same form for the vacuum and the charged cases.

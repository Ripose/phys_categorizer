INTRODUCTION

The past decades have seen an enormous development with respect our knowledge of the behavior and properties
of atoms exposed to strong external ﬁelds. This holds equally for time-dependent electric as well as static electric
or magnetic ﬁelds (for reviews of the subject concerning static ﬁelds see Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).
In case of static
homogeneous magnetic ﬁelds the hydrogen atom served as a paradigm for the eﬀects due to the combined Coulomb
and magnetic interactions [1]: It is one of the most fundamental few-degrees of freedom quantum systems whose
classical counterpart shows a transition from regularity to chaos ﬁnally exhibiting a (almost) completely chaotic
phase space. The investigations on hydrogen in a magnetic ﬁeld had major impact on a variety of other ﬁelds such
as nonlinear dynamics, semiclassics of nonintegrable systems as well as magnetized structures in general [1]. On the
other hand major advances in high resolution laser spectroscopy allowed a detailed and highly instructive comparison
of theoretical results and experimental data.

Turning to astrophysics the success of the investigations on hydrogen in a strong magnetic ﬁeld is equally impressive.
During the eighties comprehensive studies of the spectrum and eigenfunctions for bound states (see Ref.[2] and
Refs. therein) were performed with particular emphasis on the regime of ﬁeld strengths occuring in the atmospheres
of magnetic white dwarfs 102 T < B < 105 T. Among others, the corresponding data have lead to a conclusive
interpretation of the observed spectrum of the white dwarf GrW+70◦8247 which was a key to our understanding of
the properties of spectra of magnetic white dwarfs in general (see e.g. Refs. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]). In the nineties detailed
investigations of the continuum properties of hydrogen in strong magnetic ﬁelds have been accomplished [11, 12].

More-electron systems are due to the occurence of the electron-electron repulsion that competes with both the
electron-nuclear attractions and the magnetic interactions much more complicated. It was only in the late nineties
that a sophisticated electronic structure method became available which allows to compute the bound state properties
of the helium atom exposed to a strong ﬁeld [13]. Subsequently [13] hundred excited states and the corresponding
oscillator strengths of their transitions have been studied with the necessary accuracy in order to perform a comparison
with astrophysical observation. Employing these data strong evidence arose that the mysterious absorption edges of
the magnetic white dwarf GD229 [14, 15, 16], which were for almost 25 years unexplained, are due to helium in a
strong magnetic ﬁeld B ≈ 50 000 T [17, 18]. Also very recently the newly established helium data were used to
analyze a number of magnetic and suspected-magnetic southern white dwarfs [19, 20].

Beyond the one- and two-electron atoms our knowledge on the behavior of multi-electron atoms subjected to strong
magnetic ﬁelds is very scarce. This is in contrast to the astrophysical necessity for further informations on the spectral
properties of multi-electron atoms. The ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey already doubled the number of known
magnetic white dwarfs [21]. It is believed that heavier atoms are present in the atmospheres of the corresponding
stars due to accretion of interstellar matter, and particularly it is expected that these objects are quite common [22].
To improve the above-mentioned situation of the lack of data for multi-electron atoms we have very recently
developed a full conﬁguration interaction approach to more-electron (N ≥ 3) atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds [23].
As a ﬁrst investigation the lithium atom has been studied in detail [23]: the ground as well as many excited states

of diﬀerent symmetries have been computed for a broad range of ﬁeld strengths with the astrophysically required
accuracy. Thereby our knowledge on the electronic structure of the lithium atom in a strong magnetic ﬁeld has been
advanced signiﬁcantly (for the state-of-the-art before this work see Refs.[24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]).

In the present work we investigate the behavior and properties of the Beryllium atom in the complete regime
0 ≤ γ ≤ 10 a.u. (following the usual convention, the ﬁeld strengths in atomic units is denoted by γ, where γ = 1
corresponds to 2.355 × 105 T) which covers in particular the ﬁeld range of the magnetic white dwarfs. Besides the
global ground state we present an analysis of many excited states possessing a variety of diﬀerent symmetries thereby
multiplying the up-to-date information on the beryllium atom in the presence of a (strong) magnetic ﬁeld. Let us
comment at this point on the existing literature. Refs.[24, 31] contain for a few ﬁeld strengths in the high ﬁeld regime
a discussion of the ground state (for that ﬁeld strengths). In Ref.[32] the ﬁeld-free ground state has been investigated
in the presence of the ﬁeld and Ref.[28] contains a discussion of the ground state in the high ﬁeld regime. Both
latter investigations deal with a Hartree-Fock approach to the electronic structure. Also within Hartree-Fock Ref.[33]
contains an investigation of the global ground state for the weak to the high ﬁeld regime. The most sophisticated
correlated approach up to date is provided in Ref.[34]. The regime 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1.0 is covered and the ground state as
well as several excited states are studied with a relatively high accuracy thereby employing a frozen-core correlated
approach. When comparing our data with the existing ones in the literature the latter will predominantly be from
Ref. [34].

We proceed as follows. Section II contains a discussion of the ﬁxed-nucleus Hamiltonian and its symmetries. Section
III describes our computational approach. Section IV presents a discussion and analysis of our results. It starts with a
discussion of the global ground state of the beryllium atom with increasing ﬁeld strength and turns then to a detailed
study of the excited states of various symmetries. In section V we report on the transition wavelengths as a function
of the ﬁeld strength. Finally section VI contains the conclusions.

II. HAMILTONIAN AND SYMMETRIES

The electronic Hamiltonian describing the beryllium atom exposed to a strong magnetic ﬁeld assuming an inﬁnitely

heavy nucleus reads as follows

where we have adopted the symmetric gauge for the vector potential and we have employed atomic units. Hi(B)
represents the ﬁeld-dependent one-particle operator containing the Zeeman-term 1/2 B · li, the diamagnetic term
1/8(B × ri)2, the Coulomb interaction with the nucleus −4/|ri| as well as the spin Zeeman contribution g/2 B · si.
Hij is a two-particle operator and represents the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion.

In the above Hamiltonian the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld coincides with the z−axis. Therefore the z−projection
of the total orbital angular momentum and of the total spin Sz are conserved. These yield the good quantum numbers
M and Sz, respectively. Furthermore the total spin is conserved and the z parity Πz represents a symmetry. In the
following we employ the spectroscopic notation ν2S+1M Πz for the electronic states, where ν stands for the degree of
excitation of a certain state with given quantum numbers S, M, Πz.

III. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

The energies of the electronic bound states are determined by mapping the Schr¨odinger equation to an ordinary
eigenvalue problem. This is done by applying a direct full conﬁguration interaction (full CI) approach. For the basis
set of atomic orbitals we choose anisotropic Gaussian functions, which have been introduced for atomic and molecular
calculations in strong magnetic ﬁelds by Schmelcher and Cederbaum [35]. This basis set has been successfully applied
to several atoms, ions and molecules [13, 36, 37, 38]. A major advantage of it is the ﬂexibility: The anisotropic
Gaussian functions can be adapted to any (zero or non zero) ﬁeld strength by adjusting the corresponding nonlinear
variational parameters. As a result the convergence properties of the electronic structure calculations using the
optimized basis sets (see below) are good for any ﬁeld strengths, although it turns out that for the intrinsically most

3

(5)

(6)

complex intermediate ﬁeld regime our approach converges fastest. The above is in contrast to symmetry adapted basis
sets, that have been employed in electronic structure investigations in ﬁelds: typically electronic eigenfunctions can be
well-described for either low ﬁeld strengths (approximate spherical symmetry) or for very strong ﬁelds (approximate
cylindrical symmetry) but lack to converge in the intermediate ﬁeld regime.

To take full advantage of the ﬂexibility of the basis functions they have to be optimized for each ﬁeld strength and
each symmetry subspace separately. To this end we determine the primitive Gaussian functions by solving diﬀerent
one-particle problems (Be3+, He+ and H) for each ﬁeld strength. In order to converge rapidly thereby using a minimal
number of basis functions, the latter have to be selected very carefully.

The four-electron beryllium calculations start with the computation of the overlap matrix S(mj, πzj ) of the Gaus-
sian functions. Only those eigenvectors {vsj (mj, πzj )} of S possessing an eigenvalue above an appropriately chosen
threshold ε are used in the following calculations. As a next step the Schr¨odinger equation belonging to the one-
particle Hamiltonian (2) is represented as an ordinary matrix eigenvalue problem. The numerical solution of this
eigenvalue problem yields the eigenvectors {hi(mj, πzj )}, which then serve as the spatial part of the one-particle
functions for the four-electron investigations. Spinors χj are constructed as a product of the usual spin eigenfunctions
α and β and the orthogonal functions {hi(mj, πzj )}. Full CI calculations are performed with four-electron Slater
determinants, which are constructed from spinors, thereby obeying the correct symmetries, i.e.

In general the core electrons and speciﬁcally the 1s2 and 2p0 orbitals, are well described by basis functions that are
optimized for the 120+- and 120−-states of Be3+, respectively. Further basis functions for the full CI calculations of
the beryllium atom are obtained by optimizing them for the corresponding one-particle problems of nuclear charge
Z = 1 and Z = 2. For the spin singlet and triplet states of beryllium exclusively only the hydrogen atom has been
employed for the optimization. For the quintet states, some of the low-lying orbitals were described by functions
optimized for He+. To be more speciﬁc, for the ν10+ states functions with one-particle symmetry mπz = 0+, 0−,
and ±1+ have been employed. The same holds for the symmetry subspaces 1(−1)+ and 3(−1)+. In order to achieve
convergence also for the excited states, orbitals optimized for the excited states of the mπz = 0+ symmetry in case
of M = 0 and of the mπz = (±1)+ symmetry in case of M = −1 optimized for hydrogen states are important. For
the symmetry subspace 1(−1)− we used more functions of the one-particle symmetry 0− optimized for the ground
and excited states of hydrogen. Additionally states for mπz = (±1)± have been used. For the triplet and quintet
symmetry subspace with positive z-parity and M = −3 the orbitals of mπz = (±2)+ replace those with (±1)− and 0−.
For the quintet symmetry subspaces 5(−3)− and 5(−6)+ additionally functions of mπz = (±3)+ symmetry character
that have been optimized for hydrogen are included in the calculations. Our calculations have been performed using
up to 50 one-particle basis functions resulting in 80 000 Slater determinants.

IV. ENERGIES

A. The global ground state and the properties of total energies

In strong magnetic ﬁelds, more precisely in the high ﬁeld regime, the total energies of bound states of an atomic or
molecular system are dominated by the orbital and spin Zeeman-contributions on the one hand side and the increase
of the kinetic energy on the other hand side. The kinetic energy depends approximately linear on the ﬁeld strength
(Landau zero point energy of the electrons) and the contributions of the Zeeman terms behave exactly linear with
the changing magnetic ﬁeld strength. The overall eﬀect of these contributions on the total energies are demonstrated
in Fig. 1. The latter shows the total energies of all 61 calculated bound states possessing negative magnetic quantum
numbers as a function of the ﬁeld strength γ. In the high ﬁeld limit a general pattern can be identiﬁed: Energy levels
corresponding to fully spin polarized states (Sz = −2) decrease monotonically with increasing ﬁeld strength, energy
levels belonging to states with Sz = −1 pass through a local minimum, and those belonging to states with a positive
total spin projection increase monotonically. This classiﬁcation of the overall behavior of the energy curves depends
exclusively on the spin projection of the states considered.

FIG. 1: Total energies ETot of all 61 calculated bound states with non positive magnetic quantum number M in a.u. as a
function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength γ. It can be seen that the behavior of the total energies can be classiﬁed by the spin
projection Sz.

With increasing ﬁeld strength the ground state of an atom exposed to a magnetic ﬁeld changes its symmetry i.e.
a crossover of several states individually representing the ground state of the atom for a certain interval of ﬁeld
strengths takes place. The orbital and spin Zeeman-terms are important for the identiﬁcation of the ﬁeld-dependent
global ground state [27, 28, 33, 39, 40]. Beyond this the magnetically tightly bound orbitals [2, 41] compared to the
non-tightly bound orbitals/states play a central role for the determination of the ground state. Since the ground state
is ﬁnally obtained by a complicated interplay of the above contributions, the electronic states forming the ground
state of the atom depending on the ﬁeld strength are not predictable a priori, but have to be determined by explicit
electronic structure calculations. For the beryllium atom investigated here, four electronic states representing the
global ground state for diﬀerent ﬁeld regimes have been found. This result coincides with an earlier one [33] based on
Hartree-Fock calculations of the beryllium atom. Having fully correlated results at hand it is now, however, possible
to ﬁnally conclude on the ground state properties of the atom. The total energies of the states constituting the
ground state are presented in Fig. 2. The low ﬁeld ground state 0 < γ < 0.0612 is the highly correlated, doubly
tightly bound singlet state 110+. Its total energy increases monotonically as can be observed for all states with a
vanishing spin quantum number Sz = 0. In the ﬁeld regime 0.0612 < γ < 1.0 the global ground state is represented
by the triply tightly bound triplet state 13(−1)+. Concerning the contributions to its total energy the increase of
the kinetic energy is now partly compensated by the spin Zeeman-term. Therefore the energy of this state does not
monotonically increase with increasing ﬁeld strength, but passes through a minimum, which is located at γ ≈ 3.22.
For 1.0 < γ < 4.62 the ground state is given by the triplet state 13(−3)+ which possesses four tightly bound orbitals.
Similar to the 13(−1)+ state, the reader should note, that its total energy passes through a minimum, which, for
this state, is located at a higher ﬁeld strength, compared to the state 13(−1)+, namely at γ ≈ 4.23. In the high
ﬁeld regime γ > 4.23 the spin Zeeman-term completely dominates the total energies. The high ﬁeld ground state is
provided by the quadruply tightly bound state 15(−6)+ of spin quintet symmetry. Its energy monotonically decreases
as a function of the ﬁeld strength γ. In the ﬁeld-free case this state is unbound.

Since the Zeeman energy and the kinetic energy predominate the total energy of the states and mask the interesting
new properties of the atomic states, we will in the following concentrate our discussion on the ionization energies.
These will reveal the binding properties of the corresponding states. For each symmetry subspace and each ﬁeld
strength, the corresponding ionization threshold has to be identiﬁed. We deﬁne here the ionization energy to respect
the symmetry properties: The threshold ET (γ, M, Sz) for total magnetic quantum number M and z projection Sz of
the total spin is deﬁned by the equation

ET (γ, M, Sz) = min

(γ, M1, Sz1) and Ee−

where EBe+
(γ, M2, Sz2) are the total energies of the Be+ ion and the electron, respectively,
depending on their magnetic quantum numbers Mi and Szi (i = 1, 2). Obviously this requires that the electronic
quantum numbers M2 and Sz2 are related to the ionic respectively atomic quantum numbers via

In order to determine the ionization thresholds many states of the Be+ ion have to be computed as a function of the

TABLE I: Total energies for Be+ in a.u. needed to determine the one-particle ionization thresholds for diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths
for the beryllium states considered here.

One implication of the above deﬁnition of the ionization threshold is the fact, that the ionization energy neither
depends on the value of the spin projection Sz, nor on the sign of the magnetic quantum number. Therefore, total
energies will be provided for one spin projection and the non-positive magnetic quantum number. The maximal
negative value of the spin projection onto the magnetic ﬁeld axis is chosen, i.e Sz = −S. By adding the corresponding
contributions of the spin Zeeman- and orbital Zeeman-term respectively, the total energies for the states with diﬀerent
quantum numbers Sz and also for the opposite sign of the orbital quantum number M can be obtained.

B. The symmetry subspace 10+.

The ionization energies for the ν10+ states (ν = 1, 2, 3) are presented in Fig. 3. Numerical values for the total and
ionization energies, the symmetries of the ionization threshold, as well as a comparison to previously published data
can be found in table II. The state 110+ represents, as mentioned above, the ground state of the atom in the low
ﬁeld regime. Its ionization energy increases monotonically with increasing ﬁeld strength. At γ = 0 it is 0.3158 a.u.,
whereas for γ = 10 it has increased to 0.5311 a.u. Comparing the total energies obtained for the 110+ state within
our fully correlated CI approach with the existing data in the literature we arrive at the following conclusions. In the
absence of the external ﬁeld the relative accuracy is 2 × 10−3 compared to the more accurate calculations in Ref.([42]).
This holds equally for the comparison of our data for ﬁnite ﬁeld strengths with the more accurate results in Ref.([34])

which uses a frozen-core correlated approach. The latter statement is correct up to γ ≈ 0.5 whereas for γ > 0.5 our
method yields lower total energies than the one employed in Ref.([34]). For ﬁeld strengths γ ≥ 2 only Hartree-Fock
results are available for comparison [27, 33] and it turns out that these are energetically higher up to one percent for
γ = 10.

state drops to 0.0977 a.u. at γ = 2. For γ > 2 the ionization energy decreases as a function of γ at a much lower
rate. Only for γ = 0 energies of this state are available for comparison [42] i.e. this state has not been investigated
previously in the literature. It turns out that our energies show a relative accuracy of 2 × 10−3 similar to the case of
the 110+ state in the absence of the ﬁeld.

in the ionization limit are also provided as a function of the ﬁeld strength.

Let us ﬁrst discuss the behavior of the energies of the singlet states. The OPIEs of the energetically lowest state
11(−1)+ which is a triply tightly bound state, does not increase monotonically but passes through a local maximum
at γ ≈ 0.5. The increase of the OPIE in the low ﬁeld regime 0 < γ < 0.5 is more pronounced for the 11(−1)+ state,
than for the 110+. It increases approximately by a factor 3 from 0.1161 a.u. at γ = 0 to 0.3284 a.u. at γ = 0.5.
For γ > 0.5 the OPIE decreases. One reason for this is the ﬁeld-dependent behavior of the ionization threshold. For
γ > 0.2 it involves the triply tightly bound Be+ state 11(−1)+. This threshold has in the latter ﬁeld regime a lower
energy than the threshold involving the ionic state 120−, which represents the high ﬁeld ionization threshold for the
10+ symmetry subspace. Considering the numerical values for the total energies of the 11(−1)+ state compared to
the literature we arrive at the following conclusions. For the ﬁeld-free case the relative accuracy is approximately
2 × 10−3 in comparing with the highly accurate values presented in Ref.[42]. In the presence of the ﬁeld for γ ≤ 0.5
the comparison with Ref.[34] shows that our values are again by a relative factor of 2 × 10−3 above the values of this
reference. However, for γ > 1 no data are available up to date in the literature.

FIG. 4: One-particle ionization energies for the states ν 1(−1)+ (ν = 1, 2) and ν 3(−1)+ (ν = 1, 2, 3) in a.u. as a function of the
magnetic ﬁeld strength γ.

The OPIE of the ﬁrst excited state 21(−1)+ shows a similar behavior as that of the ground state. It increases in
the low ﬁeld regime and decreases in the high ﬁeld regime thereby exhibiting a local maximum at γ ≈ 0.2. Total
energies for this state are available only for a vanishing external ﬁeld and our computed value shows in this case a
relative accuracy of 10−3 compared to the value provided in Ref.[42].

Let us turn to the discussion of our results for the triplet symmetry shown in Fig. 4. The singlet and triplet
symmetry subspaces are closely related. Table IV shows, that the one-particle ionization threshold is represented by
the same states of the Be+ ion. But the reader should keep in mind, that the ionization thresholds for both subspaces
do not possess the same energy, because of the diﬀerent spin projections, chosen for the total energies. It can be seen
in Fig. 4 that the ionization energies of the triplet states are typically larger than those of the corresponding singlet
states. However, they follow the same overall behavior: In the low ﬁeld regime the energies increase, whereas they
decrease in the high ﬁeld regime showing in between a local maximum. Furthermore one observes, that the OPIEs
of the 11(−1)+ and 13(−1)+ and the states 21(−1)+ and 23(−1)+ approach each other for the highest ﬁeld strengths
investigated here.

Values for total energies for ﬁnite γ are available in the literature exclusively for the 13(−1)+ state but not for
the excitations of this symmetry. We therefore discuss here only the accuracy of the energies of this state. In the
absence of the ﬁeld our relative accuracy compared to the accurate results of Ref.[42] is approximately 5 × 10−4. In
the presence of a weak ﬁeld our total energies are above those of Ref.[34] by a relative diﬀerence of 2 × 10−4. This
diﬀerence decreases with increasing ﬁeld strength and for γ > 0.5 our results are variationally lower compared to
those of Ref.[34]. For γ ≥ 2 only Hartree-Fock results are available [33] which are systematically higher in energy by
approximately 4 × 10−4 relative deviation.

D. The symmetry subspaces 3(−1)−

We present in this subsection our results for the triplet states for magnetic quantum number M = −1 and negative
z parity. The ground and one excited state have been investigated here. Although table V shows, that the ionization
thresholds for this symmetry are the same as for the corresponding subspace with positive z parity, the ionization
energies show a completely diﬀerent behavior. For the 13(−1)− state it increases monotonically with increasing ﬁeld
strength for the complete regime considered here: from 0.0562 a.u. at γ = 0 to 0.5215 a.u. at γ = 10. Comparing
our results for the total energies of this state with the literature we arrive at the following conclusions. For γ = 0 we
have a relative accuracy of 10−3 compared to the values presented in Ref.[42]. In the presence of the ﬁeld for γ ≤ 0.5
our variational total energies are larger than those of Ref.[34] by a relative change of 5 × 10−4. For γ = 1 our value
is below that of Ref.[34] and for γ > 1 no data are available in the literature for comparison.

According to our study (and deﬁnition of the ionization threshold) the 23(−1)− state starts to possess a signiﬁcant
binding energy of the outer electron from γ ≈ 0.2 on. Its ionization energy increases monotonically but the rate of
this increase decreases for γ > 0.5 and seems to approach an asymptotic value at approximately 0.12 a.u. No data
are available in the literature on this state in the presence of the ﬁeld. In the absence of the ﬁeld the total energy

given in ref.[42] amounts to -14.38462 a.u.

E. The 3/5(−3)+ symmetry subspaces

Here we discuss the ground and a single excited state of spin triplet 3(−3)+ symmetry and the ground as well as

two excited states of spin quintet 5(−3)+ symmetry.

Let us begin our analysis with the spin triplet states. Results for this symmetry subspace are presented in Fig. 6
and table V. The ground state of the spin triplet symmetry with magnetic quantum number −3 and positive z parity
is a quadruply tightly bound state, being predominantly described by the orbitals 1s22p−13d−2. These orbitals are
the energetically lowest tightly bound orbitals. As a consequence the 13(−3)+ state becomes for suﬃciently high
ﬁeld strengths the state with the largest OPIE among the states considered here (the most tightly bound state of the
beryllium atom in the high ﬁeld limit is the 1s22p2
−1-state which however is a spin singlet state and is not investigated
here). This holds particularly in the high ﬁeld limit, although in this ﬁeld regime the total energy of the quintet
states is much lower. For γ = 0 the ionization energy amounts to 0.0388 a.u. and at γ = 10 to 1.2789 a.u. The
corresponding monotonous increase of the OPIE can clearly be seen in Fig. 6. For ﬁeld strengths γ < 0.2 we could
not detect the existence of this bound state in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld. For γ ≥ 0.5 the only available

values for the total energies in the literature are due to the Hartree-Fock approach employed in Ref.[28]. Our values
are systematically lower than the Hartree-Fock values showing a typical relative deviation of 3 × 10−3.

FIG. 6: One-particle ionization energies for the states ν 3(−3)+ (ν = 1, 2) and ν 5(−3)+ (ν = 1, 2, 3) in a.u. as a function of the
magnetic ﬁeld strength γ.

The ionization energy of the ﬁrst excited state 23(−3)+ increases monotonically for γ < 5 but shows a decrease
when doubling the ﬁeld strength to γ = 10. We obtain an ionization energy 0.0872 a.u. at γ = 0.5 and 0.1490 a.u.
for γ = 5. This state has up to date not been investigated in the literature.

Let us now discuss the states of the quintet spin symmetry. The ground state 15(−3)+ of this symmetry is a triply
tightly bound state, which is predominantly described by the conﬁguration 1s2s2p−13d−2. A monotonically increasing
OPIE for γ < 2 can be observed for this state (see Fig. 6). For γ ≥ 2 the ionization energy decreases, which is a
consequence of the change with respect to the ionization threshold: For lower ﬁelds the ionization threshold involves
the doubly tightly bound 14(−1)+ state of Be+ and for γ ≥ 2 it involves the triply tightly bound state 14(−3)+.
Similar statements hold for the ﬁrst and second excited states of this symmetry. Table VI shows, that the increase of
the OPIE for the ground state 15(−3)+ as well as the ﬁrst and second excited state 25(−3)+ and 35(−3)+ are very
strong for γ < 2. For the ground state the ionization energy increases from 0.0547 a.u. at γ = 0 to 0.5558 a.u. at
γ = 2, i.e. by approximately one order of magnitude. For the ﬁrst and second excited state we encounter 0.0293 a.u.
and 0.0172 a.u. at γ = 0 and 0.1297 a.u. and 0.0521 a.u., respectively, at γ = 2, i.e. an increase by approximately
a factor of 4 respectively 3. In the regime γ ≥ 2 the relative decrease of the ionization energy of the ground state
is stronger than those for the ﬁrst and the second excited states. Data from the literature to compare with are only
available for the ground state 15(−3)+ of this symmetry and only Hartree-Fock results in the strong ﬁeld regime.
Comparing with the latter data [28] our total energies are systematically lower by a relative change of 5 × 10−4.

F. The 5(−3)− and 5(−6)+ symmetry subspaces

11

In this subsection we discuss the spin quintet states with magnetic quantum numbers −3 and −6 possessing negative
and positive z−parity, respectively. For the states of 5(−3)− symmetry a particular behavior of their ionization energies
can be observed in Fig. 7. The corresponding numerical results are given in table VII. For the ground state the OPIE
increases in the ﬁeld regime 0 < γ < 0.05: we encounter 0.0172 a.u. at γ = 0.001 and 0.0572 a.u. at γ = 0.05. In the
regime 0.05 < γ < 0.2 it passes through a local minimum and for 0.2 < γ < 2 a rapid increase of the ionization energy
with increasing ﬁeld strength takes place. At γ = 0.2 it amounts to 0.0578 a.u. whereas at γ = 2 it is one order of
magnitude larger and amounts to 0.6364 a.u. Thereafter for even larger ﬁeld strengths the increase is slowing down
signiﬁcantly. The reason for the latter is a change with respect to the ionization threshold. For γ ≤ 1 the ionization
threshold involves the Be+ state 4(−1)+ where as for γ & 1 the triply tightly bound Be+ state 14(−3)+ deﬁnes the
threshold. It represents the high ﬁeld global ground state of the beryllium positive ion.

The OPIE of the ﬁrst excited state 25(−3)− shows a similar behavior as that of the ground state. However, in
contrast to the ground state its ionization energy decreases for γ ≥ 2 signiﬁcantly. Again only for the ground state
15(−3)− and in the strong ﬁeld regime there are data of Hartree-Fock calculations [28] available to compare with.
Equally our total energies are variationally lower than those of the Hartree-Fock calculations by a relative deviation
of 10−3.

TABLE VII: Total energies ETot, one-particle ionization energies EIon, and previously published data ELit in a.u. for the states
ν 5(−3)− (ν = 1, 2) and ν 5(−6)+ (ν = 1, 2) as well as the threshold symmetry TSym at diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths γ.
aRef. [28].

Let us now turn to the states of 5(−6)+ symmetry. The ground state 15(−6)+ represents the global ground state
of the beryllium atom in the high ﬁeld limit. It is the energetically lowest (we are refering, of course, to the total
energy) quadruply tightly bound quintet state and is predominately described by the conﬁguration 1s2p−13d−24f−3.

However, this conﬁguration does not represent the most tightly bound state with four occupied tightly bound orbitals
for any ﬁeld strength. The OPIEs of the ground and the ﬁrst excited state increase monotonically in the strong ﬁeld
regime γ ≥ 1. In the low ﬁeld regime these states represent highly excited states in the continuum which are not
bound. Similar to the previously discussed cases also for this symmetry there are only Hartree-Fock data [28] available
for the ground state. Comparing with the latter our total energies are variationally lower by typically 4 × 10−4.

V. ELECTROMAGNETIC TRANSITIONS

In the present section we discuss the behavior of the wavelengths λ of the allowed electric dipole transitions as a
function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength. The regime of wavelengths to be considered is λ < 105 ˚A. We will focus on
the circular polarized transitions ν10+ −→ µ1(−1)+ (ν = 1, 2, 3, µ = 1, 2) shown in Fig. 9 and the linear polarized
transitions ν3(−1)+ −→ µ3(−1)− (ν = 1, 2, 3, µ = 1, 2) presented in Fig. 10.

For the circular polarized transitions ν10+ −→ µ1(−1)+ (ν = 1, 2, 3, µ = 1, 2) presented in Fig. 9 one observes,
that in the ﬁeld range 0 < γ < 0.05 the transition wavelengths are approximately constant. In this ﬁeld regime the
inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld is weak. However, in the intermediate and high ﬁeld regime the transition wavelengths
show a pronounced ﬁeld-dependence. For γ > 1 an overall decrease of the transition wavelengths is observable. In the
regime 0.05 < γ < 1 some lines increase, others do not. To be more speciﬁc: The transitions (ν, µ) = (1, 1), (1, 2), and
(2, 2) show an increase of the wavelengths, whereas the transitions (ν, µ) = (2, 1), (3, 1), and (3, 2) show a monotonous
decrease. The origin of this behavior is the less rapid increase of the total energies of the µ1(−1)+ states compared
to the ν10+ states. Therefore crossovers of the corresponding energy levels occur, which lead to divergent transition
wavelengths (these are, due to the crude grid of ﬁeld strengths employed here, visible as peaks in the ﬁgure 9).

For the linear polarized transitions ν3(−1)+ −→ µ3(−1)− (ν = 1, 2, 3, µ = 1, 2) depicted in Fig. 10, the behavior
in the low ﬁeld regime γ < 0.05 is very similar to the one of the circular polarized transitions discussed above, i.e.
two of the three wavelengths in this regime are almost independent of the ﬁeld strength. This does not hold for the
transition 33(−1)+ −→ 13(−1)− (shown with dotted line and black circles). The latter is due to the fact, that the
OPIE of the state 33(−1)+ is nearly ﬁeld independent and is at γ = 0 only a factor of two smaller than the OPIE of
the state 13(−1)−. The ionization energy of the latter state increases for weak ﬁelds (γ < 0.05) about a factor of two
and as a result the corresponding transition wavelengths decrease.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the electronic structure of the beryllium atom exposed to a strong magnetic ﬁeld in the
regime 0 ≤ γ ≤ 10 a.u. Our approach is based on a recently developed full conﬁguration interaction method for multi-
electron systems that employs anisotropic Gaussian orbitals which are optimized for each ﬁeld strength separately.
Our results comprise the global ground state and its crossovers as a function of the ﬁeld strengths. Earlier results on
the Hartree-Fock level have been conﬁrmed and reﬁned. Beyond this we have studied many excited states of various
symmetries thereby covering spin singlet, triplet and quintet states with magnetic quantum numbers |M | = 0, 1, 3, 6

FIG. 10: Transition wavelengths λ for the linear polarized transitions ν 3(−1)+ −→ µ3(−1)− (ν = 1, 2, 3, µ = 1, 2) in ˚A as
a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength γ. For γ > 0.05 the reader observes that the wavelengths corresponding to the
transitions with (ν, µ) = (2, 1), (3, 1) and (3, 2) decrease monotonically whereas those for the transitions (1, 1), (1, 2) and (2, 2)
exhibit distinct maxima.

and for both positive and negative z−parity. A total of 18 excited states (not counting the spin multiplicity) have
been studied and analyzed i.e. their total and one-particle ionization energies as well as the corresponding transition
wavelengths for allowed dipole transitions have been discussed. The one-particle ionization energies show a rich
variability as a function of the ﬁeld strength depending in particular on the number and type of tightly bound orbitals
that are contained in the conﬁgurations dominating the individual electronic states. Many excited states have been
investigated for the ﬁrst time for ﬁnite ﬁeld strengths. For the states that have already been studied in the literature
a comparison of our data shows that our total energies are variationally higher by a relative change of typically 10−3
or less for the regime of ﬁeld strengths 0 ≤ γ ≤ 0.5. This discrepancy is however not due to limitations of our basis
set, which possesses a very high ﬂexibility, but more an eﬀect of the large number of conﬁgurations emerging for a
four-electron system within a full conﬁguration interaction approach for a given (moderately sized) basis set. Going
to larger atomic systems it is therefore desirable to choose another conﬁguration interaction approach instead of the
full one which allows to treat larger basis sets. For γ ≥ 0.5 our results are almost exclusively variationally lower
than the existing ones in the literature by typical relative deviations of several times 10−3. This conﬁrms the already
known feature that our approach performs best in the intermediate regime of ﬁeld strengths.

For Phys.Rev.A

In the accompanying Comment [Phys. Rev. A 67, 056501
(2003)], I. Lindgren and S. Salomonson claim to prove for the
Kohn-Sham kinetic energy functional of ground state electron
density that a Fr¨echet functional derivative exists, equivalent
to a multiplicative local potential function. If true, this re-
sult would imply an exact Thomas-Fermi theory for ground
states of noninteracting electrons. However, such a theory
is not consistent with the exclusion principle for more than
one electron of each spin. The simplest counterexample is the
lowest triplet state of a noninteracting two-electron atom. If
only the total electron density were normalized, as in Thomas-
Fermi theory, the lowest state would collapse into a doubly-
occupied 1s spin-orbital. Two independent parameters ǫ1s
and ǫ2s are required to maintain independent subshell nor-
malization. The argument presented by these authors is dis-
cussed in the light of this unphysical implication.

The underlying issue here is whether Hohenberg-Kohn
theory [1] implies an exact ab initio Thomas-Fermi the-
ory (TFT) for ground states. For noninteracting elec-
trons, the question reduces to the existence of a Fr´echet
functional derivative [2] of the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy
functional [3], equivalent to a multiplicative local poten-
tial function. If such a functional derivative did exist, it
could be expressed as

orbital subshell densities. Density variations generated
by unconstrained independent variations in the orbital
Hilbert space are necessary and suﬃcient to determine
the Euler-Lagrange equations. Spin indices and sums are
assumed but suppressed in the notation here. For nonin-
teracting electrons, the correct Euler-Lagrange equations
for Fermi-Dirac electrons, as used in Kohn-Sham theory,
are a set of Schr¨odinger equations,

where ˆt = − 1
2 ∇2, for orthogonal but independently nor-
malized orbital functions φi(r). Independent orbital nor-
malization requires independent parameters ǫi, and or-
bital orthogonality implies the exclusion principle. The
restriction to one free parameter in Eq.(1) means that the
exclusion principle cannot be enforced unless all energy

eigenvalues ǫi are equal. Hence, in a compact system,
these equations cannot be reconciled for more than one
electron of each spin. The simplest speciﬁc example is
the lowest 1s2s 3S state of a two-electron system. TFT
implies bosonic condensation with two electrons in the 1s
spin-orbital. The argument of Lindgren and Salomonson
[4] (LS) must fail, because it implies that TFT is an exact
theory for noninteracting electrons. The proposed argu-
ment also disagrees with DFT, in which the Kohn-Sham
equations for noninteracting electrons are just Eqs.(2),
valid for atomic shell structure and consistent with the
exclusion principle. The TFT and DFT Euler-Lagrange
equations are inconsistent in the 1s2s 3S example, be-
cause two independent constants cannot be deduced from
one. This conclusion has been disputed and defended in
recent publications [5–7].

P

LS put forward two variational derivations that set
out to determine the density functional derivative of the
Kohn-Sham kinetic energy functional Ts[ρ], constructed
as the ground-state limit of the Schr¨odinger orbital func-
i ni(i|ˆt|i). In Section IIA, they con-
tional T [{φi}] =
sider an N-electron wave function Ψ. For noninteracting
electrons, the Schr¨odinger equation is separable, and the
wave function can be expressed as a serial product of or-
bital functions, Ψ = Πiφi(ri). Fermi-Dirac statistics are
not implied, but must be imposed by explicit orthogonal-
ization and by independent normalization of the partial
densities ρi = φ∗
In terms of partial densities, LS
Eq.(18) should be δT =
i ni(ǫi − v)δρi. Instead, LS
extend the functional derivative of Eq.(22) to unnormal-
ized densities by making the implicit assumption that
the undetermined constant has no orbital subshell struc-
ture, which is inconsistent with the orbital Schr¨odinger
equations. This point can be examined in detail by con-
sidering speciﬁc wave functions, as in LS Section IIB.

R P

In Section IIB, LS propose a variant of standard
Hartree-Fock theory in which the product of orbital over-
lap integrals is retained, in contrast to the usual sim-
pliﬁed argument based on the orbital functional T .
If
done correctly, this variant leads to standard Hartree-
Fock equations, equivalent for noninteracting electrons
to Kohn-Sham equations, in which the kinetic energy
operator ˆt takes its usual form. The problem here is
that all terms in the total energy expression for a Slater
determinant must be considered together. To enforce or-
bital orthonormality, as required by the deﬁnition of a
Slater determinant, a matrix of Lagrange multipliers ǫij
is required. It is customary (for closed-shell systems) to
assume a diagonalized canonical representation, leaving
the diagonal elements ǫi to be determined as eigenval-

ues of the canonical Hartree-Fock equations. These are
Lagrange multipliers for independent normalization con-
straints (i|i) = 1. Derivations using the simpliﬁed or-
bital functional T are standard in applications of DFT
and are consistent with Hartree-Fock theory. Products of
the overlap factors are unity for variational solutions and

tion, overlap variations are multiplied by a factor that
vanishes. An appropriate variational functional for non-
interacting electrons is

ni(i|ˆt + v(r) − ǫi|i)Πj6=i(j|j).

This is derived directly for a serial product wave func-
tion, with Lagrange multipliers for independent orbital
normalization. Orbital orthogonality is implied by the
Euler-Lagrange equations or by symmetry. The ﬁrst fac-
tor in each term here vanishes in stationary states, so
all variations of the overlap product drop out, and varia-
tions of the ﬁrst factor are multiplied by unity. Written
out in full, the correct diﬀerential for variations about a
stationary state is

This vanishes for a stationary state, but cannot do so
unless all Lagrange multipliers ǫi are included, precluding
an equivalent Thomas-Fermi theory.

The argument presented by LS fails to consider the
full variational expression including (i|v(r)−ǫi|i) for each
occupied orbital. LS Eq.(33) should be written as

δTs = hδφ1|ǫ1 − v(r)|φ1ih2|2i

+ hδφ2|ǫ2 − v(r)|φ2ih1|1i + cc,

(5)

plus terms involving δ(i|i) that drop out of Eqs.(4). A
correct derivation must take into account that the nor-
malization product modiﬁes all terms of Eq.(3), and mod-
i niρi. The func-
iﬁes the usual DFT deﬁnition ρ =
tional derivative must be consistent with the Hartree-
Fock equations implied for Fermi-Dirac electrons. Fail-
ure to include a separate Lagrange multiplier for normal-
ization of each occupied orbital is inconsistent with the
constraints needed to specify a Slater determinant as the
variational trial function.

The chain rule connecting orbital and density func-
tional derivatives of the functional Ts[ρ] is a consistency
condition implied by the Kohn-Sham construction of Ts
using the Schr¨odinger orbital functional T [7]. In their
discussion of the chain rule appropriate to DFT, LS in-
voke an expression, LS Eq.(36), that is undeﬁned unless
a Fr´echet functional derivative exists. The integral in
LS Eq.(36) is inappropriate, since ρ is an explicit func-
tion of φ∗
i . LS Eq.(38) is inconsistent with the orbital

Euler-Lagrange equations. Such logic can be avoided be-
cause the ground-state functional, extended to include
density variations unrestricted by normalization, deﬁnes
Gˆateaux derivatives [2] such that [7]

A Fr´echet derivative is implied only if all ǫi are equal.
Alternatively, since these Gˆateaux derivatives are oper-
ationally equivalent to the Schr¨odinger operator ˆt, one
can deﬁne a generalized functional derivative as such a
linear operator. Using this generalized deﬁnition, the
Kohn-Sham equations can be derived entirely in terms
of density functional derivatives [8].
LS misstate the mathematical

implications of the
fact that the noninteracting Kohn-Sham or Schr¨odinger
equations imply by direct construction the existence of
Gˆateaux functional derivatives of the extended functional
Ts [7]. Unless all ǫi are equal, this implies that a Frech´et
functional derivative does not exist. If a Fr´echet deriva-
tive is simply assumed, in order to deﬁne an extended
functional of total density, the theory is inconsistent with
Fermi-Dirac statistics. As a consequence of the exclu-
sion principle, there is no physically correct deﬁnition of
such an extended functional. However, because Gˆateaux
derivatives exist, a unique extended functional of the sub-
shell densities ρi is deﬁned. This suﬃces to determine the
Euler-Lagrange equations of the theory [9]. For practical
applications of DFT, which must assume a parametrized
functional Exc[ρ], the implied universal functional Fs has
the same properties as Ts. An extended functional Fs[ρ]
and the Fr´echet derivative required by TFT do not exist
in general for more than two electrons, but a unique ex-
tended functional of the partial densities ρi does exist, as
do the Gˆateaux derivatives required to determine Euler-
Lagrange equations. This generalizes TFT to a theory
consistent with Fermi-Dirac statistics and with electronic
shell structure [9].

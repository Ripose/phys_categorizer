Competition among moleular fragmentation hannels desribed with Siegert hannel

pseudostates

Department of Physis and JILA, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0440

Edward L. Hamilton and Chris H. Greene

To desribe multiple interating fragmentation ontinua, we develop a method in whih the vibra-

tional hannel funtions obey outgoing wave Siegert boundary onditions. This paper demonstrates

the utility of the Siegert approah, whih uses hannel energy eigenvalues that possess a negative

imaginary part. The eletron sattering energy in eah suh hannel is rotated upward, giving it an

equal and opposite imaginary part. This permits a natural inlusion of vibrational ontinua without

requiring them to appear as expliit hannels in the sattering matrix. Calulations illustrate the

appliation of this theory to photoionization, photodissoiation, and dissoiative reombination.

In this Letter, we propose a di(cid:27)erent tool to desribe

where R0 is a value beyond whih the value of the poten-

oupling between eletroni and dissoiative ontinua,

tial is negligible. We seek a solution expanded in terms

based on a Siegert pseudostate basis representation of

of some primitive basis set

permits dissoiative proesses to be handled automati-

Figure 2: Dissoiative photoionization ross-setion, as a ratio

to the total photoionization ross-setion. The solid line is the

urrent theory, the dotted line is an earlier theory [19℄, and

the points are data from various experimental measurements

[16, 17, 18℄.

Figure 3: Dissoiative reombination ross setion for the

model potential, unonvolved (solid) and onvolved with a

Lorentzian of width 0.1 eV (dashed), ompared to that re-

sulting from the O'Malley formula (dotted).

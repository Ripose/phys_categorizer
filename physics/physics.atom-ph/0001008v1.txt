Absolute total cross sections for electron capture between slow, highly charged ions and alkali
targets have been recently measured.
It is found that these cross sections follow a scaling law
with the projectile charge which is diﬀerent from the one previously proposed basing on a classical
over–barrier model (OBM) and veriﬁed using rare gases and molecules as targets.
In this paper
we develop a ”semi–classical” (i.e.
including some quantal features) OBM attempting to recover
experimental results. The method is then applied to ion–hydrogen collisions and compared with
the result of a sophisticated quantum-mechanical calculation. In both cases the present method is
found to underestimate by a factor two the correct result but, where comparison can be made, it is
superior to other OBMs. A qualitative explanation for the discrepancies is also given.

I. INTRODUCTION

The electron capture processes in collisions of slow, highly charged ions with neutral atoms and
molecules are of great importance not only in basic atomic physics but also in applied ﬁelds such as
fusion plasmas and astrophysics.
In the past years a number of measurements have been carried on the collisions between highly
charged ions and rare gases [1] or molecules [2], in which one or several electrons were transferred
from the neutral target to a charged projectile:

A+q + B → A(q−j)+ + Bj+ .

Their results-together with those from a number of other laboratories-yielded a curve which can
be ﬁtted within a single scaling law (a linear relationship) when plotting cross section σ versus
projectile charge q:
it is almost independent of the projectile species and of the impact velocity
v (at least in the low–speed range v < 1 au). When one extends experiments to diﬀerent target
species, the same linear relation holds between σ and q/I 2
t , with It the ionization potential of the
target [3,4].
It is found that this scaling law could to be predicted, in the limit of very high projectile charge, by
a modiﬁcation of an extended classical over–barrier model (ECBM), allowing for multiple electron
capture, proposed by Niehaus [5]. Quite recently a conﬁrmation of this scaling has come from a
sophisticated quantum–mechanical calculation [6].

Similar experiments were carried on more recently for collisions between ions and alkali atoms
[7]. The results show that the linear trend is roughly satisﬁed, but the slope of the straight line is
grossly overestimated by the ECBM: in Fig. 1 we show some data points (stars with error bars)
together with the analytical curve from the ECBM (dashed curve) which, for one–electron atoms,
is written [3,4]

σ = 2.6 × 103q/I 2

(It in eV). It should be noticed that experimental data are instead well ﬁtted by the results of a
Classical Trajectory MonteCarlo (CTMC) code [7].

The ECBM of ref. [3] works in a simpliﬁed one-dimensional geometry where the only physically
meaningful spatial dimension is along the internuclear axis. It does not take into account the fact
that the electrons move in a three-dimensional space. This means that only a fraction of the electrons
actually can fulﬁl the conditions dictated by the model. For rare gases and molecules, which have a
large number of active electrons, this can be not a trouble (i.e., there are nearly always one or more

electrons which can participate to the collision). For alkali atoms with only one active electron, on
the other hand, an overestimate of the capture probability by OBM’s could be foreseen.

With present–days supercomputers there are relatively few diﬃculties in computing cross sec-
tions from numerical integration of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (e.g. refer to ref. [6]).
Notwithstanding this, simple models are still valuable since they allow to get analytical estimates
which are easy to adapt to particular cases, and give physical insight on the features of the problem.
For this reason new models are being still developed [8,9].
In this paper we present a modiﬁed OBM which allows to get a better agreement with the experi-
mental data of ref. [7].

II. THE MODEL

We start from the same approach as Ostrovsky [8] (see also [10]): be r the electron vector relative
to the neutral atom (T) and R the internuclear vector between T and the projectile P (see Fig.
2 for a picture of the geometry: it is an adaptation of Figure 1 from ref. [8]). Let us consider the
plane containing the electron, P and T, and use cylindrical polar coordinates (ρ, z, φ) to describe the
position of the electron within this plane. We can choose the angle φ = 0 and the z direction along
the internuclear axis. We will assume that the target atom can be described as an hydrogenlike
atom, which is not a bad approximation when dealing with alkali atoms.
The total energy of the electron is

E =

p2
2

+ U =

p2
2 −

Zt

pρ2 + z2 −

pρ2 + (R − z)2

Zp

.

Zp and Zt are the charge of the projectile and the eﬀective charge of the target seen by the electron,
respectively, and we are using atomic units.
We can also approximate E as

E(R) = −En −

Zp
R

.

En is given by the quantum–mechanical value: En = Z2
correct as R → ∞.

On the plane (e, P, T) we can draw a section of the equipotential surface

t /(2n2). This expression is asimptotically

U (z, ρ, R) = En −

Zp
R

.

This represents the limit of the region classically allowed to the electron. When R → ∞ this region is
decomposed into two disconnected circles centered around each of the two nuclei. Initial conditions
determine which of the two regions actually the electron lives in.
As R diminishes there can be eventually a time where the two regions become connected. It is easy
to solve eq. (5) for R by imposing that ρm = 0 and that there must be an unique solution for z
with 0 < z < R:

Rm =

Zt +pZtZp

En

.

In the spirit of OBMs it is the opening of the equipotential curve between P and T which leads
to a leakage of electrons from one nucleus to another, and therefore to charge exchange. Along the
internuclear axis the potential U has a maximum at

z = z0 = R

.

√Zt

pZp + √Zt

Whether the electron crosses this potential barrier depends upon its initial conditions. These are
chosen from a statistical ensemble, which we will leave unspeciﬁed for the moment. Let NΩ be the
fraction of trajectories which lead to electron loss at the time t and W (t) the probability for the
electron to be still bound to the target, always at time t. The fraction of losses in the interval t, t+dt
is given by

dW (t) = −NΩ

with Tem the period of the electron motion along its orbit. A simple integration yields the leakage
probability

Pl = 1 − exp(cid:18)−

Tem Z +∞

NΩdt(cid:19) .

In order to actually integrate Eq. (9) we need to know the collision trajectory; an unperturbed
straight line with b impact parameter is assumed:

At this point it is necessary to give an explicit expression for NΩ. The electron is supposed to be in
the ground state (n = 1, l = m = 0). Tem becomes therefore [11]

R = pb2 + (vt)2

.

Tem = 2π/Z3
t

.

Ref. [8] adopts a geometrical reasoning: the classical electron trajectories, with zero angular momen-
tum, are ellipses squeezed onto the target nucleus. The only trajectories which are allowed to escape
are those whose aphelia are directed towards the opening within the angle ±θm. The integration
over this angle yields an analytical expression for NΩ (Eq. 17 of ref. [8]). In Fig. 1 we show the
results obtained using Ostrovsky’s model ( dotted curve–eqns. 8,17 of ref. [8]) 1. Notice that from
direct inspection of the analytical formula, one sees that the scaling law is not exactly satisﬁed, at
least at small values of the parameter q/I 2
t , and this is clearly visible in the plot. The result is
almost equal to the scaling (2).

The present approach is based on the electron position instead than on electron direction . The
recipe used here is (I) to neglect the dependence from the angle: all electrons have the same proba-
bility of escaping, regardless of their initial phase. Instead, (II) the lost electrons are precisely those
which, when picked up from the statistical ensemble, are found farther from nucleus T than the
distance z0:

NΩ = Z ∞

,

with f (r) the electron distribution function.

There is not a unique choice for f (r): the (phase-space) microcanonical distribution

˜f (r, p) ∝ δ(cid:18)En +

p2
2 −

Zt

r (cid:19)

(δ is the Dirac delta) has been often used in literature since the works [12] as it is known that,
when integrated over spatial coordinates, it reproduces the correct quantum–mechanical momentum
distribution function for the case of the electron in the ground state [13] (more recently the same
formalism has been extended to Rydberg atoms [14]). After integration over momentum variables
one gets instead a spatial distribution function [15]

fmc(r) =

Zt(2Zt)3/2

π

r2r 1
r −

Zt

,

r < 2/Zt

and zero elsewhere (The lowerscript ”mc” is to emphasize that it is obtained from the microcanonical
distribution). However, this choice was found to give poor results. It could be expected on the basis
of the fact that (14) does not extend beyond r = 2/Zt and misses therefore all the large impact–
parameter collisions. In the spirit of the present approach, it should be instead important to have an
accurate representation of the spatial distribution. We use therefore for f (r) the quantum mechanical
formula for an electron in the ground state:

which, when substituted in (12), gives

f1s(r) = 4Z3

1Beware of a small diﬀerence in notation between the present paper and [8]: here we use an eﬀective charge for the target,
Zt = √2En, while [8] uses an eﬀective quantum number nt = 1/√2En with the eﬀective charge of the target set to 1.

NΩ = (cid:2)1 + 2r0Zt + 2(r0Zt)2(cid:3) exp (−2r0Zt)

.

(16)

Since the choice for f (r) does not derive from any classical consideration, we call this method a
“semi–classical” OBM.
Notice that, in principle, one could go further and compute f (r) from a very accurate wavefunction,
fruit of quantum mechanical computations (see [16]), but this is beyond the purpose of the present
paper (it could be worthy mentioning a number of other attempts of building stationary distributions
f (r), mainly in connections with CTMC studies, see [17–19]).
The f (r) of Eq. (15) does not reproduce the correct momentum distribution, nor the correct energy
distribution (which could be obtained only by using eq. (13). However, it is shown in [15] that this
choice gives an energy distribution for the electrons, f (E), peaked around the correct value En, and
< E >= En, where < . . . > is the average over f (E).

Some important remarks are to be done here. First of all, a question to be answered is: why use an
unperturbed distribution, when the correct one should be sensitively modiﬁed by the approaching of
the projectile. The answer is, obviously, that this choice allows to perform calculations analitically.
We are doing here a sort of classical counterpart of a quantum–mechanical Born calculation: there,
too, the matrix elements are computed as scalar products over unperturbed states, regardless of
any perturbation induced by the projectile. In the following, however, some considerations about
possible improvements over this simple approximation will be done.
A second question regards the meaning of the factor dt/Tem in eq.
in Ostrovsky’s paper
this is the fraction of electrons which enter the loss zone during the time interval dt and is valid
under the hypothesis of a uniform distribution of initial phases of the electrons. In our case this
this assumption ceases to be valid: electrons actually spend diﬀerent fractions of their time at
diﬀerent radial distances from T, depending on their energy. We will do a (hopefully not too severe)
assumption by assuming that, on the average, the expression (8) still holds.

III. RESULTS

A. Iodine - Cesium

This study has been prompted by the ion-atom experiments of [7]: ﬁrst of all, therefore, we apply

the above model to the process of electron capture

Iq+ + Cs → I(q−1)+ + Cs+

with q = 6 ÷ 30. Impact energy is 1.5 × q keV [7]. The ionization potential of Cesium is It = 3.9
eV. Solid line in Fig. 1 is the result of the present model: the ratio between the OBM result and
the true one is passed from a factor near three to something less than 50% (which means that, in
absolute value, the disagreement is reduced).
We will attempt here a possible explanation of this underestimate: we have used in Eq.
(15)
an unperturbed wavefunction, while the electron distribution function must be modiﬁed by the
approaching of the projectile. Since the electron is attracted by P, the distribution function is likely
to be more weighted at larger r’s:
in a quantum mechanical treatment, the perturbation of the
electron due to the projectile would translate in an excitation to higher states. We will ﬁnd in the
following subsection some results in favour of this hypothesis.

B. Bare ions - Hydrogen

As second test, we have computed cross section for captures

and

H + O8+ → H+ + O7+

H + He2+ → H+ + He+

and compared it with similar calculations done using the molecular approach by Harel et al [20].
The results are summarized in ﬁg. 3. There is a sharp discrepancy in the behaviour for v → 0,
where the present model predicts an increasing cross section. At very low speed it is the concept

itself of atomic distribution function which becomes questionable, and molecular aspects become
important. Besides, quantum eﬀects such as the discreteness of the energy levels also play a major
role and are completely missed by this approach. In the higher velocity part, the present model
underestimates the more accurate value by a factor 2 for process (18), but the error is much less,
just 25 %, for process (19). These two ions have been chosen ad hoc: they correspond to values of
the ratio Zt/Zp = 1/8 and 1/2 respectively. In the (I, Cs) test this ratio ranged from ≈ 1/12 to
≈ 1/60 depending upon the projectile charge. This means that in the former case the perturbation
of the projectile on the electron distribution function is comparable to the (I, Cs) case, while in the
latter it is much less. We expect the electron distribution function to be more and more perturbed
as Zt/Zp → 0.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have developed in this paper a very simple OBM for charge exchange. It exploits some features
of the quantum mechanical version of the problem, thus diﬀering from similar models which are solely
classical. The agreement with experiment is better than previous calculations where a comparison
could be made. It is far from excellent, but reasons for the (partial) failure have been suggested.
As it stands, the model is well suited for one-optical-electron atoms (since it uses hydrogen–like
wavefunctions), therefore we do expect that other classical OBM’s can still work better in the
many-electrons targets studied in previous experiments.
Some improvements are likely to be added to the present model: a possible line of investigation
could be coupling the present method with a very simpliﬁed calculation of the evolution of the
wavefunction, using quantum mechanics. From this one should not compute the f as coming from
a single state, but as a linear combination including also excited wavefunctions (the relative weights
in the combination should be given by the quantum mechanical calculation). Work in this direction
is currently underway.

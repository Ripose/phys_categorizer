Abstract

We report results of diﬀerential cross sections for elastic scattering, target-

elastic Ps excitations and target-inelastic excitation of hydrogen in a ﬁve-state

coupled-channel model allowing for Ps(1s)H(2s,2p) and Ps(2s,2p)H(1s) excita-

tions using a recently proposed time-reversal-symmetric regularized electron-

exchange model potential. The present model yields a singlet Ps-H S-wave

resonance at 4.01 eV of width 0.15 eV and a P-wave resonance at 5.08 eV of

width 0.004 eV. We also study the eﬀect of the inclusion of the excited Ps

and H states on the convergence of the coupled-channel scheme.

Lately, there have been great interest in the experimental [1–4] and theoretical [5–7]

studies of ortho positronium (Ps) atom scattering from diﬀerent neutral atomic and molecu-

lar targets. We suggested a time-reversal symmetric regularized nonlocal electron-exchange

model potential [8] and used it in the study of total cross section of Ps scattering by H [9], He

[8,10], Li [11], Ne [12], Ar [12] and H2 [13]. Our results were in agreement with experimental

total cross section [1,2], specially at low energies for He, Ne, Ar and H2. Among all Ps-atom

systems, the positronium-hydrogen (Ps-H) system is the simplest and is of fundamental

interest.

In our ﬁrst studies on Ps-H system we calculated the partial cross sections, low-energy

phase shifts, scattering lengths and eﬀective ranges and S-wave singlet resonance and binding

energies using a regularized model-exchange potential [9,10]. This potential has a parameter

which allows for small variations of the scattering observables at low energies. The results

for scattering at high energies is insensitive to the variation of this parameter. At medium

and high energies the cross sections of the present model reduce to [14] the ﬁrst Born

cross sections with Oppenheimer exchange potential [15]. The present model is made to

reproduce simultaneously the accurate variational estimates for the singlet S-wave resonance

[16] and Ps-H binding energies [17]. The agreement of the calculated singlet resonance

and binding energies with the variational estimates assures of the realistic nature of the

regularized exchange potential [9]. Hence, for the sake of completeness a study of the

diﬀerential cross sections for Ps-H scattering with the regularized electron-exchange potential

seems worthwhile.

In this paper we present a theoretical study of Ps-H scattering employing a ﬁve-state

model allowing for excitation of both Ps and H atoms using the regularized model exchange

potential mentioned above. We calculate the diﬀerential cross sections for quenching in

addition to those for diﬀerent elastic and inelastic transitions. We also report the energies

and widths of the singlet Ps-H resonances in diﬀerent partial waves.

The theory for the coupled-channel study of Ps-H scattering with the regularized model

potential has already appeared in the literature [8–10]. It is worthwhile to quote the relevant

working equations here. We solve the following Lippmann-Schwinger scattering integral

ν and β2

ν′ are the binding

energies of the initial and ﬁnal states of H and Ps in atomic units, respectively, and C is the

only parameter of the potential. Normally, the parameter C is taken to be unity which leads

to reasonably good result. However, it can be varied slightly from unity to get a precise ﬁt

to a low-energy observable. This variation of C has no eﬀect on the scattering observables

at high energies and the model exchange potential reduces to [14] the Born-Oppenheimer

exchange potential [15] at high energies.

After a partial-wave projection, the singlet (+) and triplet (−) scattering equations (1)

are solved by the method of matrix inversion. The maximum number of partial waves in-

cluded in the solution of the integral equation is 100 and the contribution of the higher partial

waves is included in the ﬁrst Born approximation. This procedure provides convergence of

the partial-wave scheme.

In the present study we use the value C = 0.785 throughout the present investigation,

as in a recent study [10]. Interestingly enough, with this value of C, the ﬁve-state model

produces a singlet S-wave Ps-H binding energy of 1.05 eV and resonance energy of 4.01 eV

with width 0.15 eV. This binding energy is consistent with both the accurate variational

estimate of 1.067 eV [17] and experimental result of 1.1 ± 0.2 eV [20]. Whereas the present

resonance energy is essentially identical to the recent variational study of 4.0058 eV, the

agreement of the present width of 0.15 eV with the variational estimate of 0.0952 eV is only

fair [16]. The 22-Ps-state R-matrix calculation [5] yielded a S-wave resonance energy of 4.55

eV with width 0.084 eV. The present model with C = 0.785 yielded a P-wave resonance at

5.08 eV with width 0.004 eV. Variational calculation for the P-wave resonance [21] yielded

a energy of 4.285 eV with width 0.0435 eV, whereas the 22-Ps-state R-matrix calculation

yielded 4.88 eV and 0.058 eV for these quantities, respectively.

Here we present results of Ps-H scattering using a ﬁve-state model that includes the

following states: Ps(1s)H(1s), Ps(2s)H(1s), Ps(2p)H(1s), Ps(1s)H(2s) and Ps(1s)H(2p). The

truncated model that includes the ﬁrst n states of this set will be termed the n-state model.

The Born terms for the simultaneous excitation of both H and Ps atoms are found to be

4

small and will not be considered here in the coupled-channel scheme. We calculate the elastic

Ps(1s)H(1s) diﬀerential cross section and inelastic diﬀerential cross sections to Ps(2s)H(1s),

Ps(2p)H(1s), Ps(1s)H(2s) and Ps(1s)H(2p) states. In addition we calculate the diﬀerential

quenching cross section for elastic scattering.

In order to show the general trend of the result, we performed calculations at the following

incident positronium energies: 20, 30, 40, 60, and 100 eV. We exhibit the diﬀerential cross

sections for elastic scattering and diﬀerential quenching cross sections for elastic scattering

at these energies in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. In Figs. 3 − 6 we exhibit the inelastic cross

sections for transition to Ps(2s)H(1s), Ps(2p)H(1s), Ps(1s)H(2s) and Ps(1s)H(2p) states at

20, 30, 40, 60, and 100 eV. From all these ﬁgures we ﬁnd that, as expected, the diﬀerential

cross section is more isotropic at low energies where only the low partial waves contribute

to the cross sections. At higher energies more and more partial waves are needed to achieve

convergence and the diﬀerential cross sections are more anisotropic.

As Ps is highly polarizable compared to H, Ps-excitation cross sections are larger than

corresponding H-excitation cross sections and Ps excitations are expected to play a more

important role in Ps-H scattering compared to H excitations. However, it is interesting to

investigate the eﬀect of the inclusion of H and Ps states on the dominating inelastic Ps cross

sections at low and medium energies. At high energies such eﬀect is small and the diﬀerent

cross sections tend to the corresponding ﬁrst Born approximation cross sections with the the

Oppenheimer exchange potential [14,15]. Hence, in addition to just reporting the diﬀerential

cross sections we also study the eﬀect of including more states in the expansion scheme to

the dominating Ps(1s,2s,2p) partial cross sections. We make this study on the partial cross

sections at diﬀerent energies which we show in Table I. From the table we see how the elastic

cross sections change with the inclusion of more Ps functions in the basis set. However, the

inclusion of basis functions corresponding to higher excitations of H states have less inﬂuence

on the convergence. Such small change of partial cross sections as in Table I will contribute to

a small diﬀerence in the corresponding diﬀerential cross sections which will be unobservable

in a plot on a logarithmic scale as in Figs. 1 − 6. Hence we do not exhibit the corresponding

diﬀerential cross sections here.

To summarize, we have performed a ﬁve-state coupled-channel calculation of Ps-H scat-

tering at medium energies using a regularized time-reversal symmetric electron-exchange

model potential recently suggested by us and successfully used in other Ps scattering prob-

lems. The present model yields a singlet Ps-H S-wave resonance at 4.01 eV of width 0.15

eV and a P-wave resonance at 5.08 eV of width 0.004 eV. We present results for diﬀerential

cross sections at several incident Ps energies between 20 eV to 100 eV for elastic scattering.

Diﬀerential cross sections of quenching scattering are also reported in addition to those for

elastic and inelastic excitation to Ps(2s,2p)H(1s) and Ps(1s)H(2s,2p) states. The eﬀect of

including the H states in the coupled-channel scheme on the elastic and Ps-excitation cross

sections is found to be small.

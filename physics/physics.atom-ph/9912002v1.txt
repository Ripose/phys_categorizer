We propose a new spectroscopic method for measuring weak transitions in cold and trapped atoms,
which exploits the long interaction times and tight conﬁnement oﬀered by dark optical traps to-
gether with an electron shelving technique to achieve extremely high sensitivity. We demonstrate
our scheme by measuring a 5S1/2 → 5D5/2 two-photon transition in cold Rb atoms trapped in a
new single-beam dark optical trap, using an extremely weak probe laser power of 25 µW. We were
able to measure transitions with as small excitation rate as 0.09 sec−1.

The strong suppression of Doppler and time-of-ﬂight
broadenings due to the ultra low temperatures, and
the possibility to obtain very long interaction times
are obvious advantages of using cold atoms for spec-
troscopy. Convincing examples of such precision spectro-
scopic measurements are cold atomic clocks [1]. For RF
clock transitions long interaction time is usually obtained
in an atomic fountain [2], while for optical metastable
clock transitions free expanding atomic clouds are used
[3].

Even longer interaction times can be obtained for cold
atoms trapped in optical dipole traps [4]. To obtain long
atomic coherence times, spontaneous scattering of pho-
tons and energy level perturbations caused by the trap-
ping laser are reduced by increasing the laser detuning
from resonance [5]. To further reduce scattering, blue-
detuned optical traps, where repulsive light forces con-
ﬁne atoms mostly in the dark (dark traps), have been
developed, achieving atomic coherence of 7 s [6]. The
wide use of dark traps was limited by relatively complex
setups that require multiple laser beams or gravity as-
sistance. Recent development of single-beam dark traps
make them more attractive for precision spectroscopy [7],
[8].

Dark traps have an additional advantage that makes
them especially useful for the spectroscopic measure-
ments of extremely weak optical transitions. While pre-
serving long atomic coherence times those traps can
provide large spring constants and tight conﬁnement of
trapped atoms [7] to ensure good spatial overlap even
with a tightly focused excitation laser beam. Therefore
the atoms can be exposed to a much higher intensity of
the excitation laser, yielding a further increase in sensi-
tivity for very weak transitions.

In this letter we present a new and extremely sensitive
method for measuring weak transitions with cold atoms
in a far detuned single-beam dark trap using electron
shelving spectroscopy [9]. Recently, a similar technique
was adapted to demonstrate quantum-limited detection
of narrow-linewidth transitions on a free expanding cold
atomic cloud [10]. Our scheme is based on a Λ system.

the |g1i → |ei transition (5S1/2F = 2 → 5D5/2F
in the case
of 85Rb) is performed. Atoms which undergo the transition
are shelved in the level |g2i (5S1/2F = 3 in 85Rb), from which
they are detected using a cycling transition (to 5P3/2F = 4).

ﬁne levels) are stored in the trap in a level |g1i that is
coupled to the upper (excited) state, |ei, by an extremely
weak transition. An atom that undergoes the weak tran-
sition, may be shelved by a spontaneous Raman transi-
tion on the second ground level, |g2i, that is uncoupled
to the excited level by the weak transition. After wait-
ing long enough, a signiﬁcant fraction of the atoms will
be shelved on this second level. Finally, the detection
scheme beneﬁts from the multiply excited ﬂuorescence of
a strong closed transition from |g2i, that utilizes quan-
tum ampliﬁcation due to the electron shelving technique.
We realized this scheme on a 5S1/2 → 5D5/2 two-
photon transition in cold and trapped 85Rb atoms (see
Fig. 1 for the relevant energy levels) using extremely
weak (25 µW) laser beam and we were able to measure
transitions with an excitation rate as small as 0.09 s−1.
Precision spectroscopy of the two-photon transition in
Rb atoms was previously demonstrated in a hot vapor

with much higher laser power [11] [12]. In cold Rb atoms
this transition was measured either on free expanding
atoms using a mode-locked laser [13] [14] or on atoms
trapped in a doughnut mode magneto-optical trap [15].
In all those schemes the ﬂuorescent 420 nm photons were
used to detect the two-photon transition.

Our spectroscopic measurement was made on cold
85Rb atoms trapped in a rotating-beam optical trap
(ROBOT). The operation principles of the ROBOT
are described elsewhere [16]. Brieﬂy, a linearly polar-
ized, tightly focused (16 µm 1/e2 radius) Gaussian laser
beam is rapidly (100 kHz) rotated by two perpendicular
acousto-optic scanners, as seen in Fig. 2. This forms a
dark volume which is completely surrounded by a time-
averaged dipole potential walls. The wavelength of the
trapping laser was 770 nm (10 nm above the D2 line) and
its power was 380 mW. The initial radius of the rotation
was optimized for eﬃcient loading of the ROBOT from a
magneto-optical trap (MOT). 700 ms of loading, 47 ms
of compression and 3 ms of polarization gradient cooling
produced a cloud of ∼ 3 × 108 atoms, with a temperature
of 9 µK and a peak density of 1.5 × 1011 cm−3. On the
last stage of the loading procedure, the atoms were opti-
cally pumped into the F = 2 ground state by shutting oﬀ
the repumping laser 1 ms before shutting oﬀ the MOT
beams.

After all laser beams were shut oﬀ (except for the
ROBOT beam which was overlapping the center of the
MOT), ∼ 3·105 atoms were typically loaded into the trap,
with temperature and density comparable with those of
the MOT. Next, we adiabatically compressed the trap
by reducing the radius of rotation of the trapping beam
from 70 µm to 29 µm such that the atoms will match
the waist of the two-photon laser, to further increase the
eﬃciency of the transition. The size of the ﬁnal cloud in
the radial direction was measured by absorption imaging
and the temperature of the atoms was measured by time
of ﬂight ﬂuorescence imaging. From these measurements
and using our precise characterization of the trapping
potential [16], the parameters of the ﬁnal cloud are: ra-
dial size (1/e2 radius) of 19 µm, axial size of 750 µm,
rms temperatures of 55 µK [9 µK] in the radial [axial]
direction, and a density of 7 · 1011atoms/cm−3. The 1/e
lifetime of atoms in the trap was measured to be 350 ms
for both hyperﬁne ground-states and was limited by col-
lisions with background atoms. We measured the spin
relaxation time of the trapped atoms to be > 1 s, by
measuring spontaneous Raman scattering between the
two ground state levels [17] [7].

The spectroscopy was performed with an external-
cavity diode laser which was tuned to the 5S1/2F = 3 →
5D5/2F ′ two-photon transition (777.9 nm) and was split
into two parts. The ﬁrst part (10 mW) was used to fre-
quency stabilize the laser using the 420 nm ﬂuorescence
signal from the two-photon excitation obtained from a
1300C Rb vapor cell. The laser was focused into the cell

to ∼ 100 µm 1/e2 radius and reﬂected back to obtain
Doppler-free spectra. We locked the laser to the atomic
line either by Zeeman modulation technique [18] or di-
rectly to the side of the line. From the locking signal we
estimated the peak-to-peak frequency noise of the laser
to be ∼ 3 MHz. The second part of the diode laser beam
passed through an acousto-optic modulator that shifted
the laser frequency toward two-photon resonance with
the 5S1/2F = 2 → 5D5/2F ′ transition. The laser beam
was then focused to a 26 µm (1/e2 radius) spot size in the
center of the vacuum chamber, in order to optimize the
eﬃciency of the two-photon transition and was carefully
aligned with the long (axial) axis of the ROBOT.

We used a normalized detection scheme to measure the
fraction of atoms transferred to F = 3 by the two-photon
laser. To detect the total number of atoms in the trap
we applied a strong 200 µs laser pulse, resonant with the
5S1/2F = 3 → 5P3/2F = 4 closed transition together
with the repumping laser and imaged the ﬂuorescent sig-
nal on photomultiplier tube (PMT). To measure only the
F = 3 population we applied the detection pulse without
the repumping laser. The F = 3 atoms were simultane-
ously accelerated and Doppler-shifted from resonance by
the radiation pressure of the detection beam within the
ﬁrst 100 µs of the pulse. Then we could detect the F = 2
atoms by switching on the repumping laser that pumped
F = 2 population to the F = 3 state where atoms were
measured by the second part of the detection pulse. This
normalized detection scheme is insensitive to shot-to-shot
ﬂuctuations in atom number as well as ﬂuctuations of the
detection laser frequency and intensity.

After the adiabatic compression of the atoms in the
ROBOT was completed, the two-photon laser on reso-
nance with 5S1/2F = 2 → 5D5/2F = 4 was applied for
various time intervals and the resulting F = 3 normalized
population fraction was detected. The results for a 170
µW two-photon laser are presented on Fig. 3. After 100
ms, ∼ 85% of the atoms are pumped to the F = 3 state.
This steady state population is less then 100% since spon-
taneous Raman scattering from the trapping laser and
from the two-photon laser (absorption of one photon fol-
lowed by spontaneous emission ) tend to equalize the pop-
ulations of the two ground levels and therefore compete
with the measured two-photon process. The characteris-
tic 1/e time of the four-photon spontaneous Raman scat-
tering process which is induced by the two-photon laser
(5S1/2F = 2 → 5D5/2F ′ → 6P3/2F ′ → 5S1/2F = 3, see
Fig. 1) is obtained from a ﬁt to the data as τ4p = 25 ms.
The corresponding (four-photon) rate is γ4p = 1/τ4p = 40
s−1. Using the theoretical value of the two-photon cross-
section of σ = 0.57×10−18 cm4/W [19], the exact branch-
ing ratio (68%) for the two-photon excitation to decay to
F = 3 [20], and our maximal excitation laser intensity of
16 W/cm2 we calculate γ4p = 391 s−1, a factor of ∼ 10
larger than the measured rate. Using a measured value
for the two-photon cross-section [21] yields a somewhat

larger value of γ4p = 823 s−1.

The main factor that reduced the measured excitation
rate was the linewidth of the two-photon laser that was
∼ 6 times larger than the 300 kHz natural linewidth
of the two-photon transition [12]. The inhomogeneous
broadening due to Stark-shift was calculated for the com-
pressed trapping potential to be ∼ 400 kHz, which is
smaller than the laser linewidth , hence it does not con-
tribute to the reduced excitation rate. An additional re-
duction of the excitation rate may be caused by imperfect
matching between the trapped atomic sample and the
maximal intensity of the two-photon laser, so the overall
agreement between the measured and the expected γ4p
is reasonable.

To measure the excitation spectrum of the 5S1/2F =
2 → 5D5/2F ′ transition we scanned the frequency of
the two-photon laser using the acousto-optic modulator.
For each frequency point the whole experimental cycle
was repeated, with 50 ms interrogation time of the two-
photon laser. The F = 3 fraction of atoms as a function
of the frequency of the two-photon laser is presented in
Fig. 4a. A 1.75 MHz linewidth (FWHM) of the atomic
lines was determined by ﬁtting the data with a multi-
peak Gaussian function and is limited by the linewidth
of the two-photon laser. This measurement agrees well
with the frequency noise of the laser estimated from the
locking signal. The distances between the lines obtained
from this ﬁt are 4.48 MHz, 3.76 MHz and 2.76 MHz,
and are in excellent agreement with previously reported
values of 4.50 MHz, 3.79 MHz and 2.74 MHz [12]. The

0.09 s−1 (for the F = 3 → F ′ = 1 transition) is detected
in this scan. The ”quantum rate ampliﬁcation” due to
electron shelving (the ratio between the measured γ4p
transition rate and the rate of the one-photon transition
used for detecting the F=3 population) is ∼ 107 for this
case.

In conclusion, we demonstrate a new and extremely
sensitive scheme to measure weak transitions using cold
atoms. The key issues in our scheme are the long spin
relaxation times combined with tight conﬁnement of the
atoms in a dark optical dipole trap, and the use of a
shelving technique to enhance the signal to noise ratio.
We demonstrated our scheme by measuring a two-photon
transition 5S1/2 → 5D5/2 for 85Rb atoms trapped in a
far-detuned rotating beam dark trap using only 25 µW
laser power. The huge quantum ampliﬁcation due to elec-
tron shelving increases the sensitivity of our scheme far
beyond the photon shot noise and technical noise encoun-
tered in the direct detection of two-photon induced ﬂuo-
rescence [11] [12] [13] [21].

Our measurements may be improved in several ways.
Improvements of the lifetime and spin relaxation time
of atoms in the trap will allow much longer observation
times and enable detection of much weaker transitions.
This can be done by increasing the trapping laser de-
tuning, where even longer spin-relaxation times are ex-
pected due to quantum interference between the two D
lines [17]. Reduction of the linewidth of the two-photon
laser will allow further improvements in the sensitivity of
our scheme. It can also be combined with mode-locked
laser spectroscopy [13] to obtain even larger sensitivities
for a given time-average power of the laser. Finally, our
technique can be applied for other weak (forbidden) tran-
sitions such as optical clock transitions [3] [10] and parity
violating transitions where a much lower mixing with an
allowed transition could be used.

expected values were calculated using the strength of the
two-photon transitions [12] together with the two photon
decay via the 6P3/2 level [20] to be 1 : 0.85 : 0.4 : 0.1, in
good agreement with the measured values, except for the

sition F = 2 → F ′ = 0 is allowed, a two-photon decay
with ∆F = 3 is forbidden and therefore this line is not

of 46. Here, the interrogation time of the two-photon
laser was 500 ms and the measured F = 3 population is

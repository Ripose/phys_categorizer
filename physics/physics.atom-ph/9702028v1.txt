Abstract

Radiative corrections to the decay rate in the low-Z
hydrogen-like muonic atoms are considered. The cor-
rection arises from the Uehling potential and it has
the relative order of α. The numerical results are re-
ported for the 2p → 1s transition for the atom with
the nuclear charge value up to Z = 10.

The work is devoted to a calculation of the radiative cor-
rections to the decay rate in the light muonic atoms. Those
arise from the electronic vacuum polarization eﬀects and it is
expected to be on the percent level. The percents level has also
been obtained measuring the ratio of some lines intensity in sev-
eral muonic atoms with not too high value of the nuclear charge
Z (see for details Ref. [1] and references there).

The non-relativistic expressions for the decay rate and inten-

sity are well known:

where relativistic units in which ¯h = c = 1 and α = e2 are used.
The leading one-loop radiative correction in the low-Z muonic
atoms can be approximated adequately by only the Uehling po-
tential term, which corresponds to a non-relativistic electrostatic
potential1. Thus, the equations given above are also valid for
the radiative corrections, for which the energies and the dipole
matrix elements have to be calculated for a Schr¨odinger particle
in a combined potential

V (r) = VC(r) + VU (r),

(3)

where the ﬁrst term corresponds to the Coulomb ﬁeld and the
other associates with the vacuum polarization eﬀects.

1The situation is in contrast with that for the ”usual” (electronic) atom, where the
main radiative contribution is due to the self energy of an electron in the Coulomb ﬁeld.

Before calculating directly, the correction can be easy esti-
mated. The estimate may be based on the fact that the Uehling
potential yields the energy shifts ∆EU (nl) close to those arisen
from the delta-like potential

Vδ(r) = A δ(r).

The unequalities

δ1 =

∆EU (1s) − 8∆EU (2s)

for the Uehling potential (see Table 1) have to be compared with
the equation

δ2 = (cid:12)

for the delta-like potential.

In case of the potential of eq. (4) the decay rate correction
[3]
is known (see Ref.
for the transitions between some higher states with n ≤ 4). The
results for the 2p → 1s decay are

[2] for the 2p → 1s transition and Ref.

and

where the unperturbated values of Γ(0) and I (0) are determined
from eq. (1) and eq. (2) within the pure Coulomb ﬁeld, the
eﬀective parameter

Rδ =

,

E0 =

mR(Zα)2

is expressed in terms of the energy shift of the ground state by
the potential and an analog of the Rydberg constant

including the reduced mass of the muonic atom mR.

The results for the 2p → 1s transition of the estimate in the
nuclear charge range 1 − 10 are summarized in Table 1. The
ﬁnal corrections for the delta-like potential of eq. (4) presented
in Table 2 are results of some cancellation of the E-contributions
(corrections to the frequency ω in eq. (1) and eq. (2)) and Ψ-
contributions (corrections to the dipole matrix element). Hence,
the uncertainties of the estimates in Table 1 may be higher than
na¨ıve expectation on the level of max{|δ1|, δ2}.

For higher value of Z another reason may be used for esti-
mating. The non-relativistic decay rate and the intensity are
proportional to (Zα)4 and to (Zα)6, respectively. The vacuum
polarization eﬀects can be also expressed in terms of the running
coupling constant

The estimate based on value of q(1s) should be rather higher
than the exact value.

The results of the straightforward calculation for the 2p → 1s
transition for the nuclear charge Z up to 10 are summarized in
Table 4. Their evaluation is based on eq. (1) and eq. (2) and
the corrections (∆ΓU and ∆IU ) are deﬁned as the diﬀerences be-
tween the Uehling potential results and the pure Coulomb ones.
The main terms are labeled by superscripts s and p associated
with the state (1s and 2p), which the correction is computed
for, and by subscripts E and Ψ corresponded to the value (the
energy and frequency or the wave function and dipole matrix
element), which the correction is calculated to. The table in-
cludes the separated contributions only to the rate. The terms
for the intensity are of the form

One can see that the p-state contributions are small enough
and the estimates by means of the delta-like potential approach
(see Table 1) have to be adequate. For the decay rate, when the
cancellation between E- and Ψ-contributions is radical, and the
estimates and the direct results are in agreement within 2δ. The
estimate by the running constant technique (see Table 3) is in
satisfactory agreement within 1.5 δα and the agreement is better
for the higher value of Z. We expect that this non-relativistic
estimation is reliable within range of the nuclear charge Z up to
30. For estimating in the both ways of the intensity the errors
are lower. Estimating according the methods outlined above is
also expected to be reliable for any transitions between low lying
levels.

The radiative correction is found to be on the one-percent
level for the nuclear charge Z = 6 − 10 and it is expected to
be larger for higher Z. Thus, this eﬀect has to be taken into
consideration for interpreting of the intensity ratio measurement
in the muonic atoms.

Abstract. Lβ2 X-ray satellite spectra of tungsten and gold are calculated using the Multi-Conﬁguration
Dirac-Fock energies and compared with recent experimental data. New calculations of L1-L3M5 Coster-
Kronig transition energies for tungsten are presented, conﬁrming the origin of the Lβ2 visible satellites
reported by two experimental groups. We found the value 5.09 eV for the average energy of the L1-L3M5
Coster-Kronig transition in tungsten. A detailed calculation of the Lβ2 and Lβ15 satellite spectra was
performed for gold.

1 Introduction

X-ray lines from almost neutral atoms are seldom pure,
being in most cases contaminated by the so-called satellite
lines, that is, X-ray lines that result from transitions in
multi-inner hole atomic conﬁgurations. In heavy atoms,
X-ray lines resulting from L → M,N hole transitions with
a M spectator hole lead, in general, to satellites that can be
resolved from the diagram line (visible satellites), whereas
the ones with N-, O- or P-shell spectator holes usually
appear embedded within the natural width of the parent
line (hidden satellites).

The study of X-ray satellite lines in systems where
only one spectator inner hole exists is more than seventy
years old, yet not very many works on this subject have
been published. Ritchmeyer and Ramberg [1] compared
their computed satellite structure of Lα1,2 (L3 → M4,5
hole transitions), Lβ2 (L3 → N5) and Lβ15 (L3 → N4)
spectra for gold with experimental data. Lα X-ray satel-
lite spectra of elements between Zr and Cd were studied
by Jusl´en et al [2]. Doyle and Shafroth [3] measured the
intensities of Lα and Lβ1 (L2 → M4) satellites of elements
in the 37 ≤ Z ≤ 56 region. Hague et al [4] reported on sil-
ver Lα satellites. Extensive tables of relativistic energies of
L X-ray satellite lines, using the Dirac-Fock-Slater (DFS)
approach including quantum electrodynamic corrections,
were published by Parente et al
[5]. The Lα1 satellite
structures of iridium, gold and uranium were studied the-
oretically by Parente et al [6] and experimentally by Car-

valho et al [7]. The possibility that L X-ray satellite lines,
not predicted by theory, could be present in tungsten was
raised by Salgueiro et al [8], to explain their experimental
data. A simple model to study the relative intensities of
satellite and diagram X-ray lines following L-shell ioniza-
tion in the region around Z = 50 was proposed by Xu and
Rosato [9]. Most recently, Vlaicu et al [10] studied the L
emission spectrum of tungsten, conﬁrming the existence
of the satellite lines found by Salgueiro et al [8], and later
Oohashi et al [11] focused on the origin of the Lβ2 visible
satellite lines in gold.

The existence of satellite lines in X-ray spectra has
been explained long ago by the creation of multiple va-
cancies in inner-shells, resulting from the ionization pro-
cess. Two mechanisms have been proposed for the cre-
ation of double vacancies after a primary ionization in the
L1 or L2 subshells, namely shake-oﬀ and Li-LjXk Coster-
Kronig transitions. Here i = 1, 2, j = 2, 3 (with i 6= j),
and Xk may be any outer subshell. The shake process,
for energies not far above the threshold, depends on the
excitation energy [12], whereas Coster-Kronig transitions
are independent on the excitation energy. Furthermore,
Coster-Kronig transitions are highly probable when en-
ergetically allowed so that, in this case, the atom, after
the primary ionization, will unavoidably end up with two
inner-shell vacancies.

Atomic K- and L-shells relativistic radiationless tran-
sition probabilities for 22 elements with atomic numbers
18 ≤ Z ≤ 96 were published in 1979 by Chen et al [13].
Earlier, in 1977, the same authors had found L1-L3M4,5
Coster-Kronig transitions to be energetically forbidden in
the region 50 ≤ Z ≤ 79 [14]. However, in 1987, Salgueiro et
al [8] obtained tungsten Lα X-ray spectra where satellite

2

lines were present, which could not be explained by the
shake mechanism. Therefore they suggested that, most
probably, Coster-Kronig L1-L3M5 transitions could take
place in tungsten, contrary to Chen et al predictions. The
existence of these satellite lines was conﬁrmed in 1998 by
Vlaicu and co-workers [10]. We note, however, that Agar-
wal [15] already referred the existence of L1-L3M5 Coster-
Kronig transitions for Z > 73 in 1979.

In this work we used the multi-conﬁguration Dirac-
Fock code of Desclaux and Indelicato [16,17,18] to cal-
culate the energies of L1- and L3M4,5-hole levels of tung-
sten, looking for the possibility of existence of L1-L3M4,5
Coster-Kronig transitions. Our results led to the conclu-
sion that L1-L3M5 transitions are indeed energetically al-
lowed in tungsten, contrary to Chen et al [14] prediction.
Furthermore, we used the same code to compute transi-
tion energies of the X-ray lines in the Lβ2 satellite band
of tungsten. As the number of lines involved is too big
to handle, we used the method suggested by Parente et
al [5], using Racah’s algebra, to predict the shape of this
satellite band.

The Lβ2 and Lβ15 satellite bands of gold, where the
number of transitions allows for a full calculation, were
also studied in this work and compared with recent experi-
mental results [11]. Spectator holes in all possible subshells
were considered in the study, including the ones that give
origin to hidden satellites. To assess the accuracy of the
method that makes use of Racah’s algebra, we also used
this method for gold, to allow for a comparison with the
results of the full calculation.

where the ψ-s are the one-electron wave functions and the
(cid:12)
coeﬃcients di are determined by requiring that the CSF is
an eigenstate of J 2 and Jz. The di coeﬃcients are obtained
by requiring that the CSF are eigenstates of J 2 and Jz. A
variational principle provides the integro-diﬀerential equa-
tions to determine the radial wave functions and a Hamil-
tonian matrix that provides the mixing coeﬃcients cν by
diagonalization. One-electron radiative corrections (self-
energy and vacuum polarization) are added afterwards.
All the energies are calculated using the experimental nu-
clear charge distribution for the nucleus.

The so-called Optimized Levels (OL) method was used
to determine the wave function and energy for each state
involved. Thus, spin-orbitals in the initial and ﬁnal states
are not orthogonal, since they have been optimized sepa-
rately. The formalism to take in account the wave func-
tions non-orthogonality in the transition probabilities cal-
culation has been described by L¨owdin [20]. The matrix
element of a one-electron operator O between two deter-
minants belonging to the initial and ﬁnal states can be
written

2 Calculation of atomic wave functions and
transition probabilities

Bound states wave functions are calculated using the Di-
rac-Fock program of J. P. Desclaux and P. Indelicato. De-
tails on the Hamiltonian and the processes used to build
the wave-functions can be found elsewhere [16,17,19].

The total wave function is calculated with the help of
the variational principle. The total energy of the atomic
system is the eigenvalue of the equation

Hno pairΨΠ,J,M (. . . , ri, . . .) = EΠ,J,M ΨΠ,J,M (. . . , ri, . . .),
(1)
where Π is the parity, J is the total angular momentum
eigenvalue, and M is the eigenvalue of its projection on the
z axis Jz. The MCDF method is deﬁned by the particular
choice of a trial function to solve equation (1) as a linear
combination of conﬁguration state functions (CSF):

The CSF are also eigenfunctions of the parity Π , the total
angular momentum J 2 and its projection Jz. The label ν
stands for all other numbers (principal quantum number,
...) necessary to deﬁne unambiguously the CSF. The cν
are called the mixing coeﬃcients and are obtained by di-
agonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix coming from the

Radiative corrections are also introduced, from a full
QED treatment. The one-electron self-energy is evaluated
using the one-electron values of Mohr and coworkers [21,
22,23] and corrected for ﬁnite nuclear size [24]. The self-
energy screening and vacuum polarization are treated with
an approximate method developed by Indelicato and co-
workers [25,26,27,28].

3 Results

3.1 Tungsten

Using the MCDF code of Desclaux and Indelicato [16,17],
we calculated the energies of all levels in the L1- and L3M5-
hole conﬁgurations of tungsten, to check for the possibility
of Coster-Kronig transitions between these two conﬁgura-
tions. Interaction of the inner holes with electrons in outer
unﬁlled shells was taken in account and full relaxation was
included but no electronic correlation.

There are 63 energy levels in the L1 conﬁguration. We
found 359 energy levels in the L3M5 conﬁguration with
energies below the lowest energy level of the L1 conﬁgu-
ration. Thus, we arrive to the conclusion that L1-L3M5
Coster-Kronig transitions are indeed possible in tungsten,
originating the double L3M5 vacancy state which after-
wards yield the satellite lines ﬁrst detected by Salgueiro
et al [8] and conﬁrmed by Vlaicu et al [10]. Averaging over
initial and ﬁnal state energies, we found for the radiation-
less transition the energy of 5.09 eV.

This value is to be compared to -2.70 eV found by Chen
et al [14], using a relativistic DFS approach. In the lat-
ter work coupling with unﬁlled outer shells was neglected.
These authors present the Coster-Kronig transition ener-
gies as diﬀerences of initial and ﬁnal average total system
energies, which does not allow for a detailed comparison
between individual level energies.

Using the MCDF computer code, we calculated the en-
ergies of all possible L3 →N5 radiative transitions in the
presence of a M5 spectator hole, L3M5-M5N5 transitions,
that yield the Lβ2 satellite band. In general, to each pair
of initial and ﬁnal angular momenta correspond several
X-ray transitions. A full calculation of transition proba-
bilities would be, in this case, a formidable task, due to
the enormous number, more than one hundred thousand,
of authorized transitions. Instead, we used Racah’s algebra
to compute the relative line intensities, using the method
of Parente et al [5]. This method assumes:
1. The initial multiplet states are populated statistically;
2. The eﬀect of the multiplet energy diﬀerences on the

X-ray matrix elements can be neglected;

3. The Auger decay rates of the various multiplet states of
a conﬁguration can be taken to be identical. In fact, for
heavy atoms there are so many open Auger channels
that the multiplet eﬀect on Auger emission rates for
double-hole states becomes minimal.

j3 = 0, . . . , 6; j′

For each pair of J, J ′ values, the remaining angular mo-
menta values can be found using standard angular mo-
menta calculations. We assumed only one line for each
pair of initial and ﬁnal angular momenta values, assigning
to this line the weighted energy and the sum of the line
component intensities, in arbitrary units. As L3M5-M5N4
transition lines are much less intense that L3M5-M5N5
lines, we did not include them in the calculation for tung-
sten.

We assume that the natural width of the L3M5-M5N5

satellite line is given by [14]

Γ (L3M5-M5N5) = Γ tot

L3 + 2Γ tot

M5 + Γ tot
N5 ,

(7)

where Γ tot
X is the natural width of X level. Using the val-
ues proposed by Campbell and Papp [29] we obtained 12.2
eV for the width of each of those satellite lines. In this way
we arrived at the tungsten Lβ2 satellite band presented in
ﬁgure 1, together with the corresponding spectrum gener-
ated using the DFS energy values of Parente et al [5].

Due to the fact that only the lowest levels of the initial
L3M5 hole conﬁguration are fed by Coster-Kronig transi-
tions from the L1 hole initial conﬁguration, the theoret-
ical X-ray satellite band generated in this work is much
narrower than if all initial levels were fed. This is clearly
shown in ﬁgure 1, as the satellite band computed using
DFS energy values included all energy levels of the L3M5
conﬁguration as initial levels.

This prediction can be compared with the experimen-
tal data of Vlaicu et al (ﬁgure 2 of
[10]). Although the
data resolution is very poor, for obvious lack of statistics,
the proeminent peak with energy around 10010 eV is well
reproduced in the theoretical band (ﬁgure 1 - MCDF). It
is obvious that experimental results with better statistics
are needed.

Vlaicu et al [10] estimated relative intensities of the L-
satellite lines for tungsten, using the expressions proposed
by Xu and Rosato [9], following the model of Krause et al
[30], with values obtained by other authors for the perti-
nent quantities. As they used Chen et al [14] results for

4

the Coster-Kronig transition probabilities, they assumed
that the Coster-Kronig channel for creating M-shell spec-
tator holes is closed, contrary to the ﬁndings of the present
work.

Racah’s algebra, as described in the text. The bands are nor-
malized in intensity.

3.2 Gold

3.2.1 Coster-Kronig transition energies

The Lβ2 and Lβ15 satellite bands of gold were studied
in this work. In this case, the existence of both L1-L3M4
and L1-L3M5 Coster-Kronig transitions were predicted by
Chen et al

[14] and conﬁrmed by our own calculation.

We found for the L1-L3M4 Coster-Kronig transition in
gold the energy of 38.23 eV and for the L1-L3M5 transition
the energy of 132.15 eV. These values are close to the 37.65
eV and 130.39 eV values, respectively, obtained by Chen
et al [13].

The theoretical Lβ2 satellite band of gold was obtained
by calculating the transition probabilities for all possible
dipolar electric transitions corresponding to the decay of
the L3M5 and L3M4 double-hole conﬁgurations, in the en-
ergy window between 11600-11700 eV, and, in a separate
way, using Racah’s algebra method, as was done for tung-
sten.

3.2.2 Full MCDF calculation of satellite band

In gold, 8 and 7 energy levels correspond to the L3M5-
and L3M4-hole conﬁgurations respectively. On the other
hand, 11 and 8 levels correspond to the M5N5 and M4N5
conﬁgurations. This leads to 149 possible electric-dipole
allowed lines between the levels of the L3M4,5 and M4,5N5

conﬁgurations that yield the Lβ2 visible satellite band.
The calculations of the energies and transition probabili-
ties for these lines were performed using the MCDF code
of Desclaux and Indelicato, in single-conﬁguration mode,
which includes all relativistic CSF originated from a single
LS conﬁguration.

The Lβ15 (L3M4,5-M4,5N4) visible satellite lines, al-
though much less intense than the previous ones, also ex-
ist in the same energy window. So, we included these lines
in our calculation.

Results for transition energies and probabilities of Lβ2,
Lβ15 and Lβ3 (L1 → M3) diagram lines are presented on
Table 1. Transition energies and probabilities for Lβ2 and
Lβ15 visible satellite lines are shown on Table 2.

Furthermore, satellite lines originating from double-
holes, in L3 and N, O, or P subshells, have energies that
are embedded in the natural widths of the diagram lines.
So, the corresponding transition energies and probabilities
have also been calculated.

In order to compare MCDF calculations of transition
energies and probabilities with experiment, we have to
know the X-ray production cross sections for lines arising
from single- and double-hole states in gold. Again, the
pertinent expressions can be found in Xu and Rosato [9],
using the model of Krause et al [30].

We deﬁne the cross section for creation of a single-hole

conﬁguration in the Li subshell as

σ′
Li = σLi (1 − QLi) ,

(8)

whereas for the L3X (X = M,N,O,P) double-hole conﬁg-
urations the corresponding expressions are

σ′
L3X = σL1 (1 − QL1 ) f13P (L1-L3X)

+ σL2 (1 − QL2 ) f23P (L2-L3X)
+ σ3QL3 (X) .

(9)

In equations (8) and (9) σLi are the Li-subshell ionization
cross sections, QLi is the sum of the shake-oﬀ probabilities
from all possible orbitals when a hole is created in the Li
subshell, fij is the partial Coster-Kronig transition prob-
ability from level Li to level Lj, P (Li-LjX) is the relative
probability of the radiationless transition Li-LjX that re-
sults in the double vacancy state LjX, and QL3 (X) is the
probability of shake-oﬀ from the X orbital when a hole is
created in the L3 subshell. It is assumed that Li vacancies
always decay before the outer M holes.

Ionization cross sections are taken from P´alinkas and
Schlenk [31], for 60 keV electron impact, and shake-oﬀ
probabilities are calculated in this work with MCDF wave-
functions (Table 3). The quantities P (Li-L3X) in equa-
tion (9) are taken from Chen et al [13] corresponding val-
ues for Hg, corrected for the diﬀerence in atomic number,
and Coster-Kronig transition probabilities are from Chen
et al [14]. Values of σ′
L3X calculated in this way are pre-
sented in the last column of Table 3.

Relative L3X double-hole to L3 single-hole conﬁgura-
tion creation cross-sections are compared in Table 4 with
those presented in reference [11]. Minor diﬀerences are due

where Γ (L3X-XN5) is the radiative width of the L3X-
XN5 transition, and Γ tot
L3X is the total width of the state
with holes in the L3 and X subshells.

Widths for L1 to N7 levels were taken from Campbell
and Papp [29]. For the remaining one-hole levels, to our
knowledge, no data are available in the literature. We used
the following values ΓO1 = 5.0 eV, ΓO2 = 3.8 eV, ΓO3 =
3.0 eV, ΓO4 = 2.4 eV, ΓO5 = 2.3 eV, and ΓP1 = 5.0 eV.
For the double-hole level widths we use Γ tot
X +Γ tot
Y ,
where Γ tot

are single-hole level widths.

In equation (13) X = M4,M5 for the visible satellites and
X = N1 to P1 for the hidden satellites. In their work,
Oohashi el al [11] assumed

allowing for a further simpliﬁcation of the equations. We
did not use here this simpliﬁcation. Instead we explicitly
calculated all the contributions for the radiative linewidths
both in diagram and satellite lines (Table 5).

The theoretical spectrum obtained using the methods
discussed above and assuming, for each line, a linear com-
bination of a Gaussian and a Lorentzian distribution, is
compared with the experimental data [11] in Fig. 2. To al-
low for a better comparison, the experimental energy was
shifted by -3.2 eV in order to superimpose the Lβ2 line in
both the theoretical and measured spectra. The discrep-
ancies between the energy values, calculated in this work,
of the diagram lines and the experimental ones are due
to the neglect of correlation and other many-body correc-
tions in our calculation [27,28,32].

To assess the validity of the calculation of relative satellite
intensities using Racah’s algebra in the case of tungsten,
we used the same procedure for the L3M4,5-M4,5N5 satel-
lite bands of gold, where a more precise calculation allows
for a comparison.

For gold, angular momenta that result from unﬁlled

equation (6), for the L3M5-M5N5 transitions we have J =

In order to compare the spectra generated using the
two diﬀerent methods, we normalized the total intensity of
the L3M5-M5N5 satellite band to the same band obtained
with the method described in 3.2.2.

The L3M4,5-M4,5N5 satellite bands thus obtained are

algebra.

In this work we computed the theoretical Lβ2 satellite
band of tungsten using MCDF relativistic transition en-
ergies and a statistical model for the shape of the band.

Due to the large number of transitions involved, we
were only able to estimate the position and the shape

of the the Lβ2 satellite band, using a method that em-
ploys Racah’s algebra to ﬁnd relative line intensities in
this band. Although the experimental values suﬀer from
very poor statistics, our results reproduce well the main
features of the measured spectrum.

In the case of gold, we used the MCDF code to com-
pute both the transition energies and the transition prob-
abilities of the Lβ2, Lβ3, Lβ15 diagram lines as well as the
Lβ2 and Lβ15 satellite lines, corresponding to spectator

holes in the M4 and M5 subshells. These satellite lines are
visible satellites. We also computed the energies and tran-
sition probabilities for the hidden Lβ2 and Lβ15 satellites.
These are satellite lines, corresponding to spectator holes
in the Ni (i = 1, 7), Oi (i = 1, 5), and P1 subshells, whose
energies are such that they are superimposed on the Lβ2
diagram line.

The values found in this work for the ratio of L3M4,5-
M4,5N4,5 to L3-N5 X-ray production cross sections are pre-

sented in Table 6. For comparison with the experiment,
the ratios of the L3M4,5-M4,5N4,5 to L3-N5 plus hidden
satellites production cross sections were also computed.
These ratios are compared with Oohashi et al [11] theo-
retical and experimental values on the same table. We note
that in the latter calculation, L3M4,5-M4,5N4 satellite line
production cross sections were not taken in account. Also,
transition yields for satellite and diagram lines are taken
by this authors as equal.

We estimate that the uncertainty in our calculation
of the relative X-ray production cross sections is of the
order of 20%, due mainly to the uncertainty in the L1-
and L3-subshells ionization cross sections which are 20%
and 10%, respectively.

The theoretical spectrum for gold obtained in this work
agrees very well with experiment. Taking in account the
uncertainties, the satellite bands relative intensities found
in this work are consistent with the measured values of
Oohashi et al [11].

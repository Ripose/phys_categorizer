Dipole-dipole instability of atom clouds in a far-detuned optical dipole trap

The eﬀect of the dipole-dipole interaction on the far-oﬀ-resonance optical dipole trapping scheme
is calculated by a mean-ﬁeld approach. The trapping laser ﬁeld polarizes the atoms and the accom-
panying dipole-dipole energy shift deepens the attractive potential minimum in a pancake-shaped
cloud. At high density the thermal motion cannot stabilize the gas against self-contraction and
an instability occurs. We calculate the boundary of the stable and unstable equilibrium regions
on a two-dimensional phase diagram of the atom number and the ratio of the trap depth to the
temperature.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The optical dipole trap provides a conservative and
tightly conﬁning trapping potential for polarizable par-
ticles. Owing to its simplicity it has become a standard
tool for manipulating neutral atoms [1]. Today, various
dipole trap based systems serve the study of many-body
problems where the atom-atom interaction is an essen-
tial ingredient. In this paper we consider far-oﬀ-resonant
trapping of polarizable particles interacting radiatively
through the electromagnetic vacuum ﬁeld.

In dense samples of cold atoms, two-atom processes
strongly inﬂuence the trapping.
For example, col-
lisional processes (photo-association, hyperﬁne ground
state changing collisions, etc.) are known to result in
trap losses and they can limit the maximum achievable
density. Collisions usually depend heavily on the internal
electronic structure of the species. For interatomic dis-
tances in the range of the optical wavelength, the atom-
atom interaction is dominated by the radiative electro-
magnetic coupling. In this case one can distinguish two
limits: the photon scattering is dominated (i) by spon-
taneous emission, e.g. in magneto-optical traps (MOT),
and (ii) by stimulated emission, which occurs in far-oﬀ-
resonant dipole traps (FORT). Since the MOT was the
ﬁrst to be able to capture dense atom clouds from vapour,
it was ﬁrst analyzed with respect to many-body eﬀects
In a MOT, the cooling laser is quasi-resonant
[2, 3].
with the atoms and the sample forms an optically thick
medium. The depletion of the laser beams together with
the multiple spontaneous scattering of resonant photons
within the sample can lead to instability [2] and extra
heating [4, 5]. At high densities, the reabsorption of pho-
tons inﬂuences the laser cooling itself [6, 7]. The com-
bination of these eﬀects can result in a highly nonlinear
collective dynamics of the atom cloud in a MOT [8, 9].

The FORT operates at an extremely low spontaneous
scattering rate, thus the eﬀects of multiple spontaneous
photon scattering are strongly suppressed. The mecha-
nism of trapping relies on the process of absorption and
stimulated emission of laser photons. This process po-
larizes the particles, hence the dipole force is accompa-
nied by the conservative dipole-dipole coupling between
atoms.

It is a formidable task to include all the atom-atom

couplings at a microscopic level.
phenomenological term proportional to the square of the
atom density was introduced to describe the atom-atom
interaction, e.g., the eﬀect of collisions on the loading of
a FORT [10, 11]. This dominates in strongly localized
traps, collisional blockade can prevent us from conﬁning
even two atoms in an extremely tiny FORT [12]. This
paper is devoted to studying, based on a microscopic the-
ory, the radiative interaction between atoms in a FORT.
We explore constraints limiting the maximum achievable
density in a FORT, which arise solely from the dipole-
dipole energy shift. We will refrain from a detailed mod-
eling of the collisions and will exclude, by assuming a
hard sphere potential, the domain of distances where the
Coulomb and exchange interaction terms require the use
of molecular potential surfaces [13].

Tuning the laser frequency ωL very far below the
atomic resonance ωA makes it possible to eliminate the
spontaneous photon scattering at a constant depth of
the trap potential, since the scattering rate and the trap
depth scale diﬀerently with the detuning ∆A = ωL − ωA.
The former is proportional to 2γΩ2/∆2
A while the latter
to Ω2/∆A where Ω is the Rabi frequency of the atom-
laser coupling, γ is the atomic linewidth (HWHM). As-
suming temperatures well below the potential depth, i.e.,
(~Ω2/∆A)/(kBT ) ≫ 1, the particles are captured in the
trap for long times. The dipole-dipole energy shift scales
similarly to the spontaneous scattering rate, however, it
is enhanced by the atom density. Thus it may become
signiﬁcant as compared to the dipole trap depth when
the atom number N obeys N γ/∆A & 0.1 in the trapped
cloud.

High atom densities can be an issue for many kinds of
experiments with FORT’s, therefore our goal is to treat
this problem in as general a way as possible. One exam-
ple is the attempt to achieve Bose-Einstein condensation
with alkali gases in optical rather than magnetic traps
[14, 15]. Another example is connected to the so-called
cavity cooling method which is suitable to complement
the deep conservative potential of FORT by a damping
force induced by the ﬁeld of a high-ﬁnesse optical res-
onator [16, 17]. Various cavity cooling setups have been
realized: (i) the FORT ﬁeld can be along the cavity axis

and detuned from the near-resonant cavity ﬁeld by sev-
eral free spectral ranges [18, 19]; or the FORT lasers can
be perpendicular to the cavity axis with photons scat-
tered into the cavity responsible for cooling [20, 21]. The
simultaneous cooling and trapping gives rise to very long
trapping times for single atoms. Cavity cooling can be
applied to many atoms as well, and should work eﬃ-
ciently until they get localized at the antinodes of the
red detuned trap ﬁeld [22, 23, 24].

The paper is organized as follows. We start by re-
capitulating the formulae of the dipole-dipole interac-
tion of atoms at a microscopic level in Sec. II. Then,
in Sec. III we take the far-oﬀ-resonance limit and keep
only the leading order terms in the small parameter
γ/∆A. During this limiting procedure we have to treat
the density-enhanced terms by a systematic expansion
and keep only the two-body terms. The basic equations
of the mean-ﬁeld model are introduced in Sec. IV. These
can be expressed in terms of dimensionless parameters,
the scaled intensity and the scaled atom number, which
deﬁne the universality of this model. Section V is de-
voted to the discussion of the trap geometry. For com-
putational convenience, we perform the numerical cal-
culations for smaller spatial sizes than that of realistic
traps. We present the results of the stability analysis in
Sec. VI. There we show the parameter regimes (laser
intensity and atom number) of stability and instability
on phase diagrams and discuss the sensitivity of these
phase diagrams with respect to the model parameters.
We conclude in Sec. VII.

II. DIPOLE-DIPOLE INTERACTION

We consider a number N of atoms interacting with a
single Gaussian standing-wave laser ﬁeld mode which has
a mode function near the center of the beam

~f (~r) = ~ǫ cos(kz z) exp

−2π2 (x2 + y2)/w2

.

(cid:3)

Here light propagates in the ˆz direction, ~ǫ is the ﬁeld po-
(cid:2)
larization, and the mode is paraxial, kz ≫ 2π/w. The
atomic transition frequency is ωA, that of the laser ﬁeld
mode is ωL, and the detuning is deﬁned by ∆A = ωL−ωA.
The atom-mode interaction strength is described by the
Rabi frequency Ω in the position of maximum coupling.
We assume an S ↔ P transition with a degenerate man-
ifold of excited states and keep the three-dimensional po-
larizability of the atoms. Actually the ﬁxed ﬁeld polariza-
tion selects two levels taking part in the dynamics. The
atomic internal degree of freedom is described by the vec-
q ~ǫqσq with q = ±1 and
torial lowering operator ~σ =
q = 0 corresponding to the circular and linear polariza-
tions, respectively. The quantization axis will be deﬁned
in accordance with the choice of the ﬁeld polarization ~ǫ.

Next to the single atom terms, i.e. kinetic energy, inter-
nal energy, and atom-ﬁeld coupling, the last term con-
tains the induced dipole-dipole interaction energy of the
atoms. Note that the natural linewidth γ characterizes
the strength of this interaction. The tensor β depends
on the coordinate diﬀerence ~Rmn ≡ ~rm − ~rn of the inter-
acting pairs of atoms.

The dipole-dipole interaction is mediated by the broad-
band vacuum, and is therefore accompanied by incoher-
ent evolution. This is represented by additional terms in
the Liouville operator responsible for the dissipation [25]:

The ﬁxed ﬁeld polarization selects the excited state
and the atom reduces to a two-level system with ~σn = σn~ǫ
(n = 1, . . . , N ). The tensors α and β have to be pro-
jected onto this particular polarization,

where β( ~Rmn) = ~ǫ †β( ~Rmn)~ǫ. We now evaluate this pro-
jection in two cases: for linear polarization along ˆx, and
for circular one in the ˆx–ˆy plane.

A. Linear polarization

When the polarization of the beam is linear, ~ǫ = ˆx, the
atomic quantization axis is taken in this direction. The
atomic polarization is described by the operator σ0, and
the projection given in Eq. (7) results in

B. Circular polarization

If the polarization is circular, ~ǫ = − 1
√2

(ˆx + iˆy), the
atomic quantization axis is the ﬁeld propagation direc-
tion ˆz. The atomic polarization is described by the op-
erator σ+1, and the projection Eq. (7) gives

The angle θmn = ∡( ~Rmn, ˆz) is the angle between the

III. LARGE DETUNING LIMIT

For red detuning (∆A < 0) the atoms are attracted to
high-intensity regions of the ﬁeld. In the large detuning
limit, i.e., where the magnitude of ∆A exceeds the atomic
linewidth γ by far, |∆A| ≫ γ, the laser ﬁeld creates a con-
servative potential for the atoms. The recoil noise is so
strongly suppressed that heating plays no role on the rel-
evant timescale of motion. It is enough to consider only

the conservative part of the dynamics described by the
Hamiltonian. The dissipative processes will be taken into
account later by the introduction of a phenomenological
temperature.

The internal electronic dynamics of the atoms consists
of fast oscillations on a short timescale. This can be adi-
abatically eliminated to derive its eﬀect on the external
motion. The adiabatic atomic polarizations, according
to Eq. (3), obey the implicit equation

The series includes terms of high order in the small pa-
rameter γ/|∆A| ≪ 1, however, not all of them can be
neglected. Such a high-order term can contain extremely
large factors provided all the Θkl in it have large values,
i.e., the corresponding atoms all are close to each other
(within a small fraction of the wavelength). This is be-
cause in the limit Rmn → 0, the dipole-dipole coupling
function gives β( ~Rmn) → ∞. However, even in this limit
α is bounded, i.e. α( ~Rmn) → 1, thus the real part of Θ
can safely be neglected in the large detuning limit.

A systematic low-density approximation of Eq. (11)
can be made by considering only two-body terms. This
amounts to the assumption that any pair of atoms can be
very closely spaced, however, in this case there is no third
atom in their immediate vicinity. Thus if for any n 6= m,
βnm ≫ 1, then for every l = 1, . . . , N such that l 6= n,

Inserting the stationary atomic polarization Eq. (12)
back into the Hamiltonian Eq. (3), and eliminating dou-
ble sums on the same ground as above yields an eﬀective
two-body Hamiltonian Heﬀ given in the Appendix. To
leading order in |βmnγ/∆A|, the polarization is σn =
f (~rn)Ω/∆A, which gives the zeroth order of the full ef-
fective Hamiltonian:

This Hamiltonian H (0)
eﬀ describes the dynamics of dipo-
lar particles, where the polarization is induced by the
external driving ﬁeld. The neglected higher order terms
describe the eﬀect of one polarized particle on the polar-
ization of another, i.e., the local ﬁeld eﬀects. The same
eﬀect is at the heart of the Lorenz-Lorentz refractive in-
dex of a dielectric medium. We will later discuss in which
parameter regime the local ﬁeld eﬀects become signiﬁ-
cant.

IV. MEAN-FIELD APPROXIMATION

In the following we will resort to an eﬀective single-
atom analysis based on a mean-ﬁeld potential. In order
to simplify the expressions, in this section we will use the
Hamiltonian in Eq. (13), which is a ﬁrst order expression
in βmnγ/∆A. The conservative dipole trap potential is

Vtrap(~r) =

f 2(~r).

where the continuous position distribution p(~r) was in-
troduced. This distribution is normalized to the number
of atoms in the trap N . A similar conservative dipole-
dipole MF potential has been studied in the case of the
Gross-Pitaevski equation for degenerate ultracold atoms
[27, 28].

In the limit of Rmn → 0, one can distinguish two or-
ders of magnitude in the expression of βmn in Eq. (8) and
3,
Eq. (9). The largest order is proportional to (kRmn)−
1. Be-
that is followed by the terms scaling with (kRmn)−
cause of the former, the dipole-dipole interaction energy
is divergent, thus we have to exclude a region around
the position ~r of the atom. We introduce a hard sphere

4

potential with radius r0, mimicking the real collisional
mechanism between the atoms. For a given detuning ∆A,
the radius r0 must be chosen such that |β(r0)γ/∆A| < 1,
so that the iterative solution in Eq. (11) is convergent.
On the other hand, to be consistent with omitting the
collisions, r0 must be larger than the scattering length
of the atoms. It can then be chosen in the order of the
hundredth of a wavelength, i.e., kr0 ≪ 1.

The ﬁnal step in setting up the model consists of
assuming that the cloud of atoms is described by a
canonical ensemble at an equilibrium temperature T .
By this approximation we avoid describing the heating
and cooling processes which lead to the steady-state.
Both are slow processes as the recoil noise is strongly
suppressed. The canonical distribution provides a self-
consistent equation for the spatial distribution of the
atoms:

p(~r) =

exp

−

Z

V (~r, p(~r))
kBT

,

(16)

(cid:21)

(cid:20)
where the partition function Z ensures that the integral
of p(x) gives the number N of atoms. This self-consistent
equation for the atom distribution is the basic equation
of our model, which can be solved only numerically. The
same method has been used to study phase transitions of
atom gases when the atom-atom interaction is mediated
by a cavity ﬁeld [24, 29].

The MF model can be expressed in terms of dimen-
sionless parameters, which amounts to the identiﬁcation
of the relevant quantities describing the equilibrium of
a trapped cloud of atoms. The dipole trap depth (see
Eq. (14)) is set by the intensity and the detuning, how-
ever, in the self-consistent equation (16) it is compared to
the temperature. None of the above quantities appears
separately, thus it is appropriate to introduce the scaled
intensity

The depth of the MF dipole-dipole potential relative to
the trap depth is determined by the product of the small
parameter γ/∆A and the atom number N through the
atomic density p(~r) in Eq. (15). The appropriate param-
eter is then the scaled atom number

I =

(17)

(18)

With these two dimensionless parameters, I and N , the
eﬀect of all the relevant physical quantities can be de-
scribed.

V. TRAP GEOMETRY

The diﬃculty of solving numerically Eq. (16) stems
from the necessity of bridging over two diﬀerent length
scales. One is the spatial resolution imposed by the cutoﬀ

6
parameter r0. This is strongly dependent on the atomic
species and we employ phenomenological values in the
range of 10-100 nm. The other is the geometrical size
of the trap, given by the Gaussian beam waist w in the
transverse direction and the wavelength λ in the axial
one. Typically w ≫ λ, thus the mode function Eq. (1)
creates a pancake-shaped cloud compressed along the ˆz
axis.

The mean ﬁeld dipole-dipole energy Eq. (15) depends
on the shape of the atomic cloud. It vanishes in the center
for a spherical atom distribution (the reﬁnement of this
statement in the case when there is no excluded volume
around the origin can be found in [30]). In the ﬁctitious
limiting case of I = ∞ the atoms are trapped in the
harmonic domain both along the cosine mode function
and transversely along the Gaussian beam envelope. In
this limit the cloud is spherical w = λ. For ﬁnite inten-
sity there is anharmonicity, diﬀerent in the orthogonal
directions, and the MF dipole-dipole energy vanishes at
slightly smaller w.

In an anisotropic pancake-shaped cloud, the dipole-
dipole contribution to the MF potential is negative, deep-
ening the trap depth in the center. We numerically tested
that choosing a waist as small as w ≥ 1.33λ can account
for the general property of having dipole-dipole attrac-
tion in the trap center. Therefore it is possible to consider
an unrealistically small waist, w/λ ∼ 1.33, which leads to
saving signiﬁcant computation time without essentially
modifying the results.

We note that for a cigar-shaped cloud the MF dipole-
dipole energy would be positive, repelling atoms from the
center, and thus the instability we discuss in the following
could not occur.

VI. STABILITY ANALYSIS

The solution of Eq. (16) can be determined numerically
by iterating the atomic distribution as follows. Starting
from a homogeneous cloud, we calculate the dipole-dipole
interaction term. This requires the evaluation of an inte-
gral similar to Eq. (15), but using the non-perturbative
two-body potential term of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (19).
This dipole-dipole term added to the dipole trap term of
Eq. (14) yields the total mean ﬁeld potential which fur-
nishes a new atomic distribution via the canonical form in
Eq. (16). The resulting p(x) can be used as the starting
distribution in the next step of the iteration. Continuing
the steps of iteration until convergence, one obtains the
self-consistent solution of Eq. (16). The iteration does
not necessarily converge:
instability can be induced by
large enough atom number or intensity. The iteration
method suggests that the instability occurs as a collapse
of the atomic cloud due to self-contraction in the center
of the trap. However, in the lack of a precise modeling
of the collisional processes, the collapse itself cannot be
accounted for by our approach. We must limit ourselves
to determining the range of convergence.

FIG. 1: The stability limit of the atomic cloud is shown in
logarithmic phase diagram of the scaled intensity I and the
scaled atom number N . The ﬁeld polarization is (a) linear
along the axis ˆx, (b) circular in the ˆx − ˆy plane, and for both
plots the waist is w = 1.33λ. We compare atoms with diﬀerent
cutoﬀ parameters, r0/λ = 0.02 (circles), 0.04 (triangles), and
0.08 (diamonds). The parameters for ﬁgure (c) are the same
as for (b) only the beam waist is larger, w = 2.22λ.

In Fig. 1 the stability range of the iterations is pre-
sented for the case of (a) linear polarization along the
axis ˆx, (b) for circular polarization in the ˆx–ˆy plane, and
(c) the same circular polarization for a somewhat larger
beam waist w = 2.22λ. On the two-dimensional plot
for the scaled atom number and scaled intensity vari-
ables (“phase diagram”), border points of the stability
region are shown for three diﬀerent cutoﬀ parameters
(r0/λ = 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08). Convergent iterative so-
lution of Eq. (16), i.e., stable cloud, exist in the region
below the points. In all three phase diagrams of Fig. 1,
the border points can be well ﬁtted by a power law depen-
dence of the critical scaled intensity on the scaled atom
c. The ﬁt is represented by lines. The
number, I ∝ N −
exponent depends on the conﬁguration:
it is c = 0.30
for linear and c = 0.43 for the circular polarization in a
w/λ = 1.33 trap, and c = 0.38 for somewhat larger beam

waist w/λ = 2.22. We note that a Gaussian ansatz for
the distribution p(x) in Eq. (16) would result in an expo-
nent c = 0.5 which is a quite poor approximation. That
is, even if the cloud is conﬁned in the harmonic regime
of the trap, the dipole-dipole interaction creates a MF
potential signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from a harmonic one.

Note that the exponent is essentially independent of
the speciﬁc choice of the cutoﬀ parameter r0 in the lower
bound of the integral in Eq. (15). This is a very impor-
tant feature demonstrating the consistency of our model.
The excluded sphere with radius r0 obviously has an ef-
fect on the depth of the MF dipole-dipole potential. The
larger the cutoﬀ parameter r0, the weaker the dipole-
dipole attraction in the center, thus the stability limit
shifts to higher I and N for increasing r0.

There are two types of deviation from the simple power
law dependence (straight line in the log-log plot). First,
the boundary lines bend below the straight line at the
right-most end (I ∼ 1). This happens below a certain
intensity, when the trap is not deep enough to collect
most of the atoms. The tail of the distribution due to
untrapped and escaping atoms is folded back on the cal-
culated area, and artiﬁcially increases the density in the
center. This indicates the limits of the simulation method
(need for monitoring larger spatial area). Second, for
very large scaled intensity, the atoms are so strongly lo-
calized along the axis z that the hard sphere radius r0
becomes comparable with the cloud size. This can be
best seen in Fig. 1b, where the curve corresponding to
the largest cutoﬀ parameter r0/λ = 0.08 deviates signif-
icantly from the straight line in the upper-left corner of
the plot. The discussion of this extreme regime is beyond
the scope of this paper.

The choice of the cutoﬀ parameter limits the maximum
localization, i. e., the maximum intensity I, our approach
is suitable for. Within the validity of the model the sta-
bility boundary on the I − N phase diagram follows a
power law dependence. This is also valid for strong lo-
calization where the cloud is entirely conﬁned in the har-
monic regime of the mode function. Hence we expect
that the power law dependence could be extrapolated for
larger scaled intensities which are allowed for atoms with
smaller cutoﬀ radius r0.

The dipole-dipole coupling enhances the trap depth in
the center and increases the atom density there. The re-
sulting self-contraction of the cloud is counteracted by
the random motion of the atoms. We expect that in-
stability occurs when the energy shift due to the dipole-
dipole coupling exceeds the thermal energy of the atoms
(kBT /2 in every direction). The numerical approach has
allowed us to conﬁrm this expectation: we found that the
necessary condition of the instability is Vdd = kBT /2. In
Fig. 2 the ratio of the dipole-dipole interaction potential
and the thermal energy is plotted on a semi-logarithmic
scale at the edge of the stable region (where still stable
solution exists), and this quantity is constant close to 0.5.

FIG. 2: Triangles with a ﬁtted straight line are the maximum
density of the cloud, p(0) in units of 1/λ3, plotted against the
scaled intensity I at a scaled atom number N slightly below
the critical one. Scattered points are the minimum of the
induced MF dipole-dipole potential Vdd/kBT calculated again
at the boundary of the range of stability. The beam waist is
w/λ = 1.33 and the radius of the hard sphere potential is
r0/λ = 0.02.

it seems very diﬃcult to express the instability condition
Vdd = kBT /2 in terms of I and N analytically. As was
mentioned previously, the distribution is not Gaussian
but a rather non-trivial function of the two dimension-
less parameters. Therefore the peak spatial density at
the trap center, and its scaling with I and N , can be
found only numerically. The result is shown in Fig. 2,
where the peak density along the critical line of Fig. 1b
is plotted together with a ﬁxed exponential function. Ob-
viously, both increasing the trap depth (at ﬁxed tempera-
ture) and increasing the absolute atom number (at ﬁxed
detuning) lead to an increase of the density. However,
as shown in the ﬁgure, the critical behavior can be in-
duced at diﬀerent peak densities depending on how it is
obtained: whether by increasing I or N . At large I,
the instability is reached at lower atom densities in the
center.

The peak density is a key parameter with respect
to reaching quantum degeneracy, which is roughly at
p(0)λ3
deBroglie ≈ ζ(3/2) = 2.612 [31]. Considering the
numerical values of the peak density at the limit of the
dipole-dipole instability in Fig. 2, one can conclude that
Bose-Einstein condensation could be reached if the ab-
solute temperature is below 100 µK. In this case the as-
sumption of a Boltzmann distribution in Eq. (16) is ob-
viously wrong. The order of the limit of reaching quan-
tum degeneracy and that of the dipole-dipole instabil-
ity depends on the working point, the absolute value
of the temperature and the dipole trap depth. For a
deep enough trap potential, e.g., in the range of mK, the
full range of the scaled intensity I shown in the plots
corresponds to much higher temperatures than 100 µK.
The classical gas assumption is consistent and the dipole-
dipole instability should occur in this case.

Finally, we discuss the validity of the eﬀective Hamilto-
nian given in Eq. (13) which keeps only the leading order
term of the dipole-dipole interaction. The phase diagram

intensity, it jumps up to 1. The exponent of the growth
increases slightly with the parameter N , it is 0.00165,
0.00170, and 0.00186 for N = 0.25, 0.5 and 1, respec-
tively. The main thing to observe is that the criticality is
reached at fairly low ratio of the dipole potential to the
total one, at a value about 0.3. It is only in the vicinity
of the critical point that the dipole-dipole term explodes
and dominates the trap potential.

VII. CONCLUSION

We set up a simple but versatile model to study the
stability of far-oﬀ-resonance trapping against the dipole-
dipole interaction. The model can be adapted to var-
ious geometries, atomic species, polarizations, etc. We
found that the radiative atom-atom interaction in the
laser polarized gas can indeed produce an instability of
a pancake-shaped atomic cloud. When the dipole-dipole
energy shift reaches the temperature, the unbalanced at-
traction in the trap center yields a collapse of the cloud.
The condition for the instability in terms of the atom
density and the temperature is obtained numerically in
the form of phase diagrams.

The density necessary for large enough dipole-dipole
shift is quite large, however, the temperature is not
needed to be very low so that the instability be observ-
able. Provided the optical dipole trap is deep enough, the
stability can be lost at moderate phase-space densities,
well above the condensation threshold. The dipole-dipole
interaction strongly dominates the inﬂuence of quantum
statistics in near-resonant laser ﬁelds [32]. This is not the
case for very large detunings, hence we expect that the
eﬀect of cloud instability oﬀers parameter regimes where
quantum statistical properties can be probed. This is the
subject of our forthcoming research.

of Fig. 3, similar to those in Fig. 1, shows that the bound-
ary calculated from the approximative Hamiltonian (13)
can be signiﬁcantly shifted from the one derived from
the full two-body Hamiltonian (19) (this latter is repre-
sented by lines connecting the data points of Fig. 1b, the
points are removed). The diﬀerence occurs for the small-

FIG. 3: The stability limits of the atomic cloud (lines) are
compared to the ones gained from the approximate ﬁrst order
interaction described by Eq. (15), (circles for r0/λ = 0.02,
triangles for r0/λ = 0.04 and diamonds for r0/λ = 0.08). The
beam waist is w/λ = 1.33.

est value of the cutoﬀ parameter, r0/λ = 0.02, when the
small hard sphere radius allows for large β values in the
power series of Eq. (12). For the other two parameters,
r0/λ = 0.04 and r0/λ = 0.08, the zeroth-order Hamilto-
nian produces perfectly acceptable results.

Although the eﬀective Hamiltonian given in Eq. (13)
may fail to predict the position of the boundary in the
phase diagram, it gives good results, e.g., for the cloud
shape, inside the stability region. This can be understood
from Fig. 4 which depicts the ratio of the MF dipole-
dipole potential to the total potential at the center of
the cloud. This is the same ratio as that of the higher
order terms of (19) to the ﬁrst order one in (13). The

In the Appendix we present the eﬀective two-body
Hamiltonian Heﬀ that takes into account the possibil-
ity of close pairs of atoms in a non-perturbative manner
as introduced in Section III.

Inserting back the stationary adiabatic atomic polar-
ization σn of Eq. (12) into the original form of the Hamil-
tonian of the system Eq. (3) and eliminating the appear-
ing double sums as described in Sec. III, one can end up

Note that the denominator of the expressions Eq. (20)

up the geometric series resulting from Eq. (11).

Apart from the zeroth order eﬀective Hamiltonian

orders of βmnγ/∆A. The new terms have two appar-
ent meaning: the second line of Eq. (19) renormalizes
the dipole trap potential (ﬁrst line), while the appear-
ing β
mn in the third line increase the strength of
the dipole-dipole interaction. This increment is negligible
and the zeroth order eﬀective Hamiltonian, Eq. (13), can
be used if βmnγ/∆A is really a small parameter, however
when it gets close to one, the non-perturbative form of
the eﬀective Hamiltonian, Eq. (19), should be used.

Abstract

It is shown that the potential for lepton-antilepton bound states (leptonium)
is the Fourier transform of the ﬁrst Born approximation to the QED scattering
amplitude in an 8-component equation, while 16-component equations are
excluded. The Fourier transform is exact at all cms energies
;
the resulting atomic spectrum is explicitly CPT-invariant.

I. INTRODUCTION

In muonium e−µ+, the mass m2 of the heavier particle is so large that the kinetic energy
p2
2/2m2 can be added as a recoil correction to the electron’s Dirac Hamiltonian. The resulting
Dirac equation has 8 components, with the Pauli matrices σ2 in the hyperﬁne operator [1,2].
However, a similar 8–component equation exists which avoids the expansion in terms of 1/m2
[3,4]. Despite its asymmetric form, it reproduces the energy levels also for positronium e−e+
to order α4 [5]. Unfortunately, its complicated derivation via Breit operators introduced
a low-energy approximation, which is removed in the present paper. The new interaction
is simply the Fourier transform of the QED Born term in the cms, valid at all energies,
(by crossing symmetry, E < 0 for e−µ+-scattering refers to E > 0 for

< E <

−∞
e+µ−-scattering). The equation is written in the cms, p = p1 =

The Pauli matrices σ2 appear only in the interaction operator KI. The proof that the
equation with KI = 0 describes two free Dirac particles instead of one is given in section II.
The construction of KI from the Born approximation is done in section III. Orthogonality
relations are derived in section IV.

Before going into details, we remind the reader that in a 16-component version,

Eψ = (H1 + H2 + H12)ψ , Hi = piαi + miβi ,

(V =

the energy levels to order α4 are not reproduced when H12 is the Fourier transform of
α/r , α = e2). This interaction
α1α2)
the Born approximation, H12 = V (1
was improved by Breit [6] and was later amended by energy-transfer [7,8] and by positive-
energy projectors [9]. The method is now quite successful in atomic theory, where the
nucleus produces an external potential for the electrons [8]. In the previous derivation of
(1) via Breit operators [3,4], a simpler prescription was used which sets the (large) squares
of Breit operators equal to zero. However, the connection with perturbative QED was then
incomplete. In the present derivation, the connection with the Born series is straightforward.
With loop graphs included, all α6-eﬀects in binding energies should appear, for arbitrary
values of m1/m2.

−

For V = 0, (1) and (3) are equivalent. In the ﬁrst Born approximation, KI of (1) and H12
of (3) are linear in V . When (3) is reduced to 8 components, quadratic terms appear which
contradict the leptonium energy levels to order α4. Some of these terms were eliminated by
a canonical transformation, the rest by projectors.

To understand the signiﬁcance of the 8-component theory, one may note that 8 is the
minimum number of components for a Lorentz- and parity invariant theory. An irreducible
representation of the Lorentz group for a single lepton requires only two components, for
example the right-handed ψR in a chiral basis. It is the parity transformation, ψ ′(
r) =
βψ(r), which exchanges ψR with the left-handed components ψL (in the chiral or Weyl basis,
γ5 and β of (2) exchange their roles). For two leptons, the necessary 2
2 = 4 components
are doubled by the matrix β of (2), which corresponds to β1β2 in a 16-component formalism.

The separate matrices β1 and β2 of the 16-component formalism provide another unnecessary
doubling.

We end this section by casting (1) into a more familiar form. We divide it by E and

deﬁne the reduced mass µ and reduced energy ǫ:

µ = m1m2/E ,

ǫ = (E2

We also anticipate the result (41) for KI, which gives:

The diﬀerence to an eﬀective Dirac equation is obviously restricted to the hyperﬁne operator
σ2)/E. As the cms energy E is close to m1 + m2 for ordinary bound states, the
−
replacement of the familiar 1/m2 by 1/E is a recoil correction. The essential new feature is
that the operator Vp is not hermitian. An 8-component equation with a hermitian operator
does not reproduce the positronium bound states.

×

Anomalous magnetic moments are neglected for the time being, so that the present
formulation does not cover atomic hydrogen. The annihilation graph in the 3S1 state of
positronium is also neglected. The hyperﬁne operator will be further simpliﬁed in appendix
A.
Its connection with the previous approximate operator [4,5] is given in appendix B.
Appendix C contains a spin summation, which is included for demonstration of covariance.

II. EIGHT-COMPONENT SPINORS FOR TWO LEPTONS

Let uig and uif denote the large and small components of the Dirac spinor u of a particle

i in an orbital:

piσi uig = (π0

i + mi) uif , piσi uif = (π0

mi) uig ,

i −

π0
i = Ei −

Ve(ri) .

(7)

Here Ve is a possible external potential, as in He-atoms. Leptonium has Ve = 0, of course.
The chiral operator γ5i exchanges uig with uif . Out of the 4 products u1gu2g . . . u1f u2f , we
keep in this section only the two combinations of total chirality +1 (the eigenvalue of γ51γ52):

Inspection shows that these combinations satisfy the following equations:

(m2p1σ1 + m1p2σ2) udg = (m2π0
m1p2σ2) udf = (m2π0
(m2p1σ1

2) udf ,
2) udg .

Apart from the m1-terms, these equations have the same structure as a single-particle Dirac
8-matrix β (which has the same eigenvalues as
equation. We therefore introduce an 8

atom. Their Born scattering amplitude for Ve 6

our construction of the interaction operator in the diﬀerential equation neglects Ve. Turning
now to the free two-body problem, we set p1 =

Including the space-dependence, the free double-spinor wave function in the cms is:

ψd(r) = ud eik1r1eik2r2 = ud eikr ,

r = r1

r2 .

−

It diﬀers from the corresponding free-particle solution of (1), which has αc replaced by α.
This diﬀerence may be one reason why (1) has not been discovered 60 years ago. During these
60 years, many diﬀerent formalisms have been developed. Bethe and Salpeter advocated
the use of four-dimensional integral equations (with a relative time as fourth integration
variable), again with 16 components. Although the relative-time concept turned out to be
useless, one learned to ﬁnd bound states from integral equations in momentum space, now
in three dimensions [2]. This method avoids the Fourier transformation. Having elaborated
these momentum space methods, one may be unwilling to return to diﬀerential equations,
particularly if these require such strange matrices as σc
1. On the other hand, the advantage
of the present formulation survives also in 8-component integral equations in momentum
space. It could become essential also in quarkonium models.

To establish the connection between (1) and (12), we ﬁrst deﬁne two mass operators:

The Dirac spin operators are γ5σ1 and γ5σ2. With the algebra (15), (16), one easily veriﬁes:

(αc)2 = (γ5σc

1)2 = (m2σ1 + βm1σ2)(m2σ1

βm1σ2)/m+m− = 3 .

−

Comparing this with α2 = 3, one sees that there should exist a transformation from αc to
α. It was ﬁrst found in an explicit decomposition of ud into udg and udf , and of the spin
states χ12 into χs (singlet) and χt (triplet, eq. (5.14) in [3]). Its compact Dirac form is:

projectors on the three states χt will also be needed:

which have the following products with Ps and Pt:

σPs = Psσ = 0 , ∆σPt = Ps∆σ , ∆σPs = Pt∆σ , σ×Ps = Ptσ× .

(21)

c is not unitary, its inverse being:

c−1 = (m+m−)−1/2(m+

2m1βPt) ,

−

which is checked by using Ps + Pt = 1, PsPt = 0. An important property of c is:

By parity invariance, the operators (20) are always accompanied by one factor γ5, which in
view of (23) replaces c−1 by c:

c σ c = σ m+/m− ,

c ∆σ c = ∆σ ,

c σ× c = σ× .

Expressing σ1 as 1

2(σ + ∆σ), one ﬁnds for the combination (13):

c−1γ5 = γ5c .

c σc

1 c = σ1 .

Thus the transformation (18) leads from (12) to the free equation (1). Other forms of that
equation are generated by additional transformations d satisfying:

βd = dβ

d−1γ5 = γ5d .

This form still has its 16-component character, as the replacement of u1u2 by ud and wd is

When E is replaced by m = m1 +m2 in the hyperﬁne operator, (5) and the corresponding

equation (42) assume Hamiltonian forms:

mAi and Ei =

Equation (47) is explicitly CPT-invariant: Every bound state si has two diﬀerent eigen-
values Ei, namely Ei = √si ≡
mAi, where mAi denotes the atomic
√si ≡ −
−
mass in the state i (an excited atom is heavier than its ground state). The later value be-
mAi. This follows from the CPT-invariance of
longs to the antiatom of mass m ¯Ai, i.e. m ¯Ai ≡
QED, which ensures that the two-particle scattering amplitude at negative E describes the
scattering amplitude of the two antiparticles. The range of the dimensionless radial variable
˜r is 0 < ˜r <
both for atoms and for antiatoms. In the old variable r, antiatoms have
negative distances. This throws new light also on the static limit m1/m2 = 0. Here one
deﬁnes Ee = E
m2 as the electron energy. For E < 0, one may use Ee = E + m2. From the
static Dirac equation in the variable ˜r, one obtains a spectrum which is symmetric around
E = 0 [5], for V =
α/˜r. If one wants to keep this symmetry as a result of CPT also in the
case of a ﬁnite nuclear charge distribution, one should parameterize V (˜r) rather than V (r).
Of course, the mere CPT-invariance of a spectrum does not guarantee its correctness.
Division of the Dirac-Breit equation by E and reformulation in terms of ˜r1 = r1/E, ˜r2 =
r2/E, ˜r = r/E also produces a CPT-invariant spectrum. But as the interaction in this
case does not reproduce the QED Born approximation at all energies, one may hope that
an 8-component formalism is again more successful. The corresponding equation has been
presented in (10) and the Born approximation has been given in a suitable form in (33), but
some details are still missing. However, it is clear that the 8-component formalism will be
quadratic in the external potential Ve, but linear in V .

APPENDIX C: SPIN SUMMATION

The propagator of a lepton-antilepton pair will be needed in the perturbative interaction
with radiation. Here we merely perform the spin summation for the trivial case of a free
pair. We remind the reader that in the 16-component formalism, one deﬁnes for particles
i = 1, 2:

i = βi , γi = γ0
γ0

i αi = γ0

i γ5iσi ,

/pi = piγi ,

which leads to the following form of the spin summation:

u1u2¯u1¯u2 = (/p1 + m1)(/p2 + m2) .

A similar notation may also be used in the 8-component version, but with the understanding
1 = γ0
γ0

2 = β , γ51 = γ52 = γ5 . Consequently, /p1/p2

= /p2/p1, but:

/p1β/p2 = /p2β/p1 ,

/p1/p2β = β/p2/p1 .

The free leptonium equation (10) and the corresponding equation for w+ become:

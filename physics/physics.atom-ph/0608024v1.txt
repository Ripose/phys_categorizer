We consider optimization of a rubidium atom clock that uses magnetically trapped Bose condensed
atoms in a highly elongated trap, and determine the optimal conditions for minimum Allan variance
of the clock using microwave Ramsey fringe spectroscopy. Elimination of magnetic ﬁeld shifts
and collisional shifts are considered. The eﬀects of spin-dipolar relaxation are addressed in the
optimization of the clock. We ﬁnd that a modulational instability results in phase separation and
symmetry breaking of the two-component condensate composed of the ground and excited hyperﬁne
clock levels, and this mechanism limits the clock accuracy.

INTRODUCTION

The most accurate atomic clocks in operation today are based either on trapped single ions or on atomic beams.
The advantage of ion clocks is that a single ion can be trapped very tightly by static electric ﬁelds such that optical
transitions do not cause signiﬁcant heating or an escape of the ion. These optical transitions are decoupled from the
trapping potential such that both ground and excited atomic states feel the same potential. On the other hand, one
advantage of atomic beam clocks is the large number of atoms in a beam, such that the quantum projection noise
can be decreased by 2-3 orders of magnitude with respect to the single ion clock. A clock based on a thermal atomic
beam suﬀers from the velocity distribution that limits the transition bandwidth. Using a Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) would signiﬁcantly ameliorate this problem. A new type of atomic clock based on neutral atoms trapped in a
deep “magic-wavelength” optical lattice (magic because the transition does not have an optical light shift because the
diﬀerence between the ac polarizabilities vanishes at the wavelength of the optical lattice) has recently been suggested
[1, 2]. This kind of clock can be operated on an optical transition, rather than a microwave transition, and promises
to be most accurate, but clocks of this type have not yet been fully characterized.

Here we consider whether a good atomic clock can be based on a more common type of trapped ultracold atom
conﬁguration, i.e., on a BEC in a magnetic trap. Trapped BECs can have many atoms, which gives them the large
number advantage mentioned above. This kind of clock might be miniaturized, as microtraps for atomic BECs can
be created above a fabricated chip. As has now been fully demonstrated, magnetic microchip traps can be used
to manipulate neutral atoms on the micrometer scale [3]. A high density, coherent atom source can be created via
Bose-Einstein condensation on an atom chip [4], and “atomic conveyor belts”, waveguides, and beam splitters can
be implemented on atom chips [3]. It is therefore intriguing to entertain the possibility of creating an atomic clock
on an atom chip [5, 6]. Hence, it is important to study theoretically and experimentally the potential of this kind
of clock. One experiment of this kind, using Ramsey spectroscopy [7], has already been carried out [5], and another
experiment has been performed in a macroscopic magnetic trap [8], but using the same spectroscopic method. More
recent mesoscopic atom clocks using coherent population trapping have been reported [6], and have the beneﬁt of
allowing compact optical light sources.

Speciﬁcally, we consider a BEC in a magnetic trap and investigate a clock based on the Ramsey separated ﬁeld
spectroscopy method [7] in a highly elongated trap. The quasi-1D geometry of an elongated trap has the advantage
of further reducing the inelastic ultra-cold collisions as shown in Ref. [9]. As in Refs. [5] and [8], we consider a two-
photon microwave transition between two 87Rb hyperﬁne states with an atomic frequency ν0 ≃
6.8 GHz. We treat the
dynamics of the clock in mean-ﬁeld and consider the amplitude and phase of the order parameters for the ground and
excited clock states of the system, solving the coupled set of 1D Gross-Pitaevskii equations to analyze the microwave
clock frequency shift due to collisional and magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects. We determine the clock frequency shift introduced
by the external magnetic potential and the kinetic energy of the Bose condensed gas, both of which are inﬂuenced by
the diﬀerence in the size of the two atomic wave packets. The clock is designed to run with 87Rb atoms in a magnetic
ﬁeld regime where the two hyperﬁne levels correlating with 51S1/2|
f = 2, mf = 1
i
experience the same ﬁrst order Zeeman shift [5, 8, 10]. The collisional frequency shift from the resonance frequency
ν0 can be calculated ´a la Ref. [8]. As we shall see, the collisional shift can be cancelled by using the Zeeman shift [8]
and by optimizing the population diﬀerence in the ground and excited states [11]. The latter optimization for 87Rb
atoms can only work in the BEC regime and is not possible for the case of thermal atoms.

[8]. For a 87Rb condensate at high density (12.6

experimentally measured [8]. Atom loss led to a total density to drop by 3% in 20 ms. Nevertheless it is important
to have a reasonable atomic number density n to compensate the eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations; the uncertainty, as
1/2. So an optimization of the density of atoms is necessary
quantiﬁed by the Allan standard deviation σ scales as n−
to reduce the quantum ﬂuctuations and the collisional dipolar relaxation in order to increase the clock time. The ﬁrst
experiment with this type of clock using a trapped thermal cloud of 87Rb atoms containing about 1.5

where τ is the averaging time [5]. For the trap parameters used here, i.e., with radial frequency ωr/2π = 120 Hz
and axial frequency ωz/2π = 0.5 Hz, and the collisional frequency shift is cancelled in mean-ﬁeld, the Allan standard

quasi-1D and has the advantage of further reducing the collisional dipolar relaxation [9].

Some additional crucial limitations might make a magnetically trapped BEC unsuitable. A signiﬁcant limitation
is the collisional interaction between the atoms. Particularly problematic is the diﬀerence in the s-wave scattering
length between atoms occupying diﬀerent hyperﬁne levels which aﬀects the collisional shift of the clock frequency.
The collisional shifts of rubidium atoms are relatively small compared to cesium atoms, for example, but they can
still be signiﬁcant if many atoms are tightly trapped together. In order to minimize collisional shifts, we shall employ
a method of overcoming collisional shifts by adjusting the ground to excited state ratio during the Ramsey fringe
spectroscopy. Moreover, the run-time of the clock is also limited by the dynamics of the atomic cloud that can result
in phase separation of the two spin components [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. We ﬁnd that a modulational instability results in
the dynamics. This gives rise to phase separation and symmetry breaking of the two-component condensate for the
ground and excited clock levels that occurs after the ﬁrst π/2 Ramsey pulse that puts the atoms in a superposition
It therefore appears that
of the ground and excited state. The modulation instability limits the clock accuracy.
magnetically trapped BEC clocks on an atom chip cannot promise to be the most accurate type of clock. The most
signiﬁcant limitation to the clock stability arises from the dynamics of the atomic cloud that creates a phase separation
of the two wave packets for the ground and excited state. The time dependence of the phase separation depends on
the density of atoms; the smaller the density, the longer the phase separation time. Hence, a very weak axial trapping
frequency (e.g., ωz/2π < 0.5 Hz) resulting in a lower density of the atoms, allows an increased interrogation time

and/or a greater total number of atoms, and therefore a further increase the stability of the clock beyond 10−
The paper is organized as follows. The model of the clock based on Ramsey spectroscopy is described in Sec. II.
Section III A brieﬂy presents the numerical approach we use to analyze the clock. In Sec. III B we depict the quasi-1D
dynamics in a trap that is very tight in two directions, and describe why the spin-relaxation collision mechanism, as
well as other inelastic scattering processes, is suppressed in a 1D geometry. Sec. III C describes the results obtained by
numerically solving the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for the order parameters of the ground and excited clock
states. In Sec. IV we discuss two ways to improve and optimize the stability and accuracy of the clock by cancelling
the collisional shift. Section V concludes the paper.

The clock described here uses the Ramsey separated ﬁeld method [7]. The atomic cloud interacts with two short
microwave pulses separated by a time T ; each pulse has pulse area close to π/2. A spatial inhomogeneity of the
atomic energy levels is due to the spatially dependent Zeeman energy due to the magnetic ﬁeld varying with position.
Clearly, this can adversely aﬀect the clock frequency. This eﬀect is minimized by using a pair of energy levels which
experience the same trapping potential at a particular magnetic ﬁeld strength. Refs. [5, 8] showed that at a magnetic
ﬁeld of
hyperﬁne levels of the 5S1/2 ground state
of 87Rb experience the same ﬁrst order Zeeman shift such that the diﬀerential shift of the two levels across the cloud
1 Hz. The collisional shift also contributes to the spatial inhomogeneity of the atomic transition energy level
was
across the cloud since the density of the cloud varies with position. However, as noted in Ref. [8], it may be possible
to cancel the Zeeman shift with the collisional shift. The stability and accuracy of the clock are further improved and
optimized by cancelling the collisional shift (as we shall see in Sec. IV).

III. MEAN-FIELD ANALYSIS OF CLOCK DYNAMICS

The performance of the clock is aﬀected by the dynamics of the two-component BEC after the ﬁrst π/2 Ramsey
pulse. We shall see below that, because of the crossed interaction energy of the two spin components created after
the ﬁrst π/2 Ramsey pulse, the system becomes unstable, and the components eventually undergo a local phase
separation that leads to a spontaneous symmetry breaking. The phase separation of the spin components limits the
Ramsey interrogation time and hence the stability of the clock.

In this section, we ﬁrst describe the numerical methods used to investigate the clock dynamics in mean-ﬁeld. Many-
body eﬀects can also be included as formulated in Ref. [18], but we shall not do so here. Then we discuss the advantage
of operating the clock in a highly elongated trap conﬁguration. We present numerical results for this conﬁguration
and analyze them.

A. Numerical method

We investigate the clock dynamics in mean-ﬁeld. The initial zero temperature condensate wave function (order
parameter) is obtained by numerically determining the lowest eigenstate ψ(r) of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii
equation for particles of mass m, conﬁned in an external potential Vext(r) and a mean-ﬁeld interaction energy due to
contact two-body interactions with coupling strength g11 = 4π~2a11/m where a11 is the s-wave scattering length for
atoms in the ground state. This is accomplished with an imaginary time split-step Fourier transform method. The
eﬀect of the ﬁrst pulse that couples the two atomic spin states is modeled using a unitary transformation on the zero
temperature ground state wave function and gives two wave functions representing the ground state and the excited
state atoms:

ψi(r, 0) = Aiψ(r)

(3)

where i = 1, 2 correspond to ground and excited state labels respectively, and Ai is the complex amplitude of state i
dr = N ,
obtained using Eq. (2). We take the normalization of the initial condensate wave function such that
where N is the total number of atoms, and the amplitudes Ai are determined by the Bloch sphere dynamics for the
1
two levels in the presence of the microwave ﬁeld inducing the transition [17]. The amplitudes Ai satisfy 0

the unitary transformation operator corresponding to a π/2 pulse. We then integrate the component wave functions
over space to obtain quantum mechanical expectation value for being two states.

B. Dynamics of the clock in a highly elongated trap

The eﬀects of the mean-ﬁeld collisional dipolar relaxation are important to investigate in order to optimize the
accuracy and the stability of the clock. As we shall see, phase separation of the two spin components due to mean-
ﬁeld dynamics, and loss of excited state atoms due to the collisional dipolar relaxation between atoms in the excited
state are two factors that can signiﬁcantly reduce the performance of the clock. The collisional dipolar loss of the

highly elongated trap; in a quasi-one-dimensional condensate the spin-dipole relaxation collisional loss can be made

Our numerical calculations have been carried out with an axial (νz) and radial (νr) trap frequency of 0.5 Hz and 120

Hz respectively, so the anisotropy ratio λ
a22 = 95.47 a0 and a12 = 98.09 a0 [8], where a0 is the Bohr radius. The optimization of the number of atoms for the
frequencies given above that gives the best Allan deviation is of the order of magnitude 104 atoms. The two pulses
used for the Ramsey separated ﬁeld method are taken to be π/2 pulses, i.e.,

A1
Fig. 1 shows the phase θi(z, t) of the ith condensate wave function, ψi(z, t) =

exp[iθi(z, t)], as a function
of position, z, in the magnetic trap. Immediately after the ﬁrst π/2 pulse, the phase of the two spin components is
spatially uniform and their diﬀerence is π/2 (Fig. 1 (a)) as is easily understood from the transformation in Eq. (2).
Following the π/2 pulse, mean-ﬁeld eﬀects begin to create a spatially varying phase across the two condensate wave
packets (Fig. 1 (b) and (c)) [25]. Beyond t = 0.24 s, the spatially dependent variations in the phase appears completely
chaotic; the mean-ﬁeld treatment has not only reached the point of numerically limited accuracy but has actually lost
its regime of validity.

Fig. 2 shows the evolution of the position dependent density of the two atomic states for a sequence of inter-pulse

and T = 1 s (Fig. 2(f)). The density of the two components are almost identical at T = 0 s and T = 0.18 s and
are smoothly varying with position. The density proﬁles begins becoming irregular at the center of the condensates
at about T = 0.20 s. At later times a spiked structure whose amplitude increases with time develops and some
local phase separation occurs (Fig. 2(c)-(f)) due to the repulsive interaction between the wave packet components. A

A rough estimate of the time scale at which the system becomes sensitive to the phase-separation instability, τps,

the momentum distribution observed from t = 0 s to t = 0.22 s is due to the fact that after the ﬁrst π/2 pulse the
interaction energy converts to the kinetic energy. To monitor the symmetry breaking shown in Fig. 1(d), we calculate

the mean value of the axial momentum of each spin component as a function of time,
where ψi(pz, t) is the Fourier transform of the condensate wave function ψi(z, t). Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the
mean value of momentum of the two condensates as a function of time. The mean value of the momentum for each
spin component is zero from 0 to 0.24 s, and then the mean momentum of each component starts oscillating in time,
but the total momentum is conserved. We note that the symmetry breaking appears after the density starts showing
an irregular proﬁle of small amplitude at its center.

We now analyze the eﬀect of the mean-ﬁeld dynamics of the system on the performance of the clock. Fig. 5 shows
the calculated probability Pe for ﬁnding atoms in the excited state immediately after the second π/2 Ramsey pulse as
a function of the detuning ∆ν of the microwave frequency from the atomic transition frequency times the interrogation
time, ∆νT . The curves in Fig. 5(a) have been calculated for three values of the interrogation time, T = 0.18 s (solid
curve), 0.5 s (dashed curve), and 1 s (dotted curve). The fringe contrast decreases as the interrogation time increases.

interrogation time of T = 0.18 s where the condensates show a smooth and symmetrical proﬁle lead to a frequency
stability of 2.6
Tc/τ where Tc is the cycle period and τ the averaging time. It is important to note that
the stability can be improved by further decreasing the axial and radial frequencies, keeping a high anisotropy ratio
so that the quasi-1D regime remains. The improvement will depend on how low the axial frequency can be made
without causing ﬂuctuations of the trapping magnetic ﬁeld. The goal is to further lower the density so as to increase
the time at which the phase separation of the two spin components after the ﬁrst microwave pulse, and hence increase
the interrogation time. The total number of atoms can also be independently optimized. Thus, it will hopefully be
possible to reach a stability beyond 10−

and varies as the square root of the axial trapping frequency. In our case, using Nﬁx = 104 atoms and ωz,ﬁx = 0.5 Hz,
we ﬁnd Tﬁx = 180 ms, and the new values of the interrogation time obtained by varying the axial trapping frequency
are within about 10% of Tﬁx.

The projection noise does not have a simple expression as a function of the radial frequency because the instability
of the BEC depends both on the density and the geometry of the cloud. Furthermore, the variation of the radial
frequency deeply aﬀects the geometry of the cloud and changes the interaction strength g1D
11 .

Normally we should add to the projection noise, the frequency noise due to the ﬂuctuation of the density introduced
by the ﬂuctuation of the total number of atoms. However, as we shall see in the next section, there is a simple method
to cancel the collisional frequency shift and then the noise due to density ﬂuctuations will cancel too.

IV.

IMPROVEMENT OF THE CLOCK: CANCELLATION OF THE COLLISIONAL SHIFT

In this section we analyze the possibility of improving the clock by cancelling the collisional shift. One of the
advantages resulting from the cancellation of the collisional shift is that the clock becomes insensitive to the variation

of the total number of atoms. Indeed, even if the density is low, nevertheless the variation of the total number of
atoms at each cycle period creates a variation of the density of the atoms and this introduces noise that limits the
stability of the clock. As the collisional frequency shift depends on the density of atoms, the idea is to cancel the
collisional shift so that such a variation of the density of atoms does not aﬀect the stability of the clock. Note that the
variation of the number of atoms we are referring to is not due to quantum ﬂuctuations but rather due to experimental
ﬂuctuations in the number of atoms. Here we present two diﬀerent proposals to overcome this problem.

A small density of atoms in the excited state minimizes the collisional dipolar relaxation loss. But the clock
sensitivity to quantum ﬂuctuations increases if the population of atoms in the excited state is too small. So an
optimization of the density of atoms is necessary to obtain both good signal-to-noise ratio and a long clock time, yet
having small collisional dipolar relaxation.

We can use the Zeeman shift to compensate the collisional shift. This method can be applied both to a normal cold
atomic cloud and a BEC, and has been proposed in Ref. [8]. However, this method requires adjusting two parameters
and seems not to be simple to implement. We will not use it in this paper. Instead, we study the cancellation of
the collisional shift terms by playing them oﬀ against each other as discussed by Gibble and Verhaar in Ref. [11] for
a thermal cesium atom clock. In the case of 87Rb atoms, this proposal can only be applied to a BEC, not a cold
thermal gas. The expression for the collisional frequency shift is [8, 11, 23, 29, 30, 31]

where n1 and n2 are the density of atoms per unit length in the ground and excited state respectively. By equating
∆νint to zero, we obtain a simple relation between the density of the atoms in the two states:

The two components are prepared by a coherent population transfer from a single component, and hence α(2)
12 = 2. In
87Rb, a12 is only slightly diﬀerent from a11 and a22, such that a2 < a12 < a11, and cancellation of the collisional shift
is possible only for a BEC since α(2)
12 = 1 the ratio n2/n1
in Eq. (13) turns out to be negative, and therefore cancellation of the collisional shift in this way is not possible. For
the scattering lengths of 87Rb we obtain for a BEC n2 = 0.95 n1. Such a ratio should maintain the sizes of the two
components almost the same.

(solid curve), T = 0.5 s (dashed curve) and T = 1 s (dotted curve).

For a ratio of densities close to unity, the Zeeman frequency shift terms due to the size of the atomic clouds will
be small. However, a problem originates from
collisional dipolar relaxation which can be important at high
density and this can limit the clock run-time. But in a quasi-1D system, the inelastic ultra-cold collisions are further
reduced.

To illustrate the improvement of collisional shift, Fig. 6 shows the calculated excited state population as a function
of ∆νT for an inter-pulse time T = 0.18 s. The dashed curve is for the case of π/2 pulses and the solid curve shows
the case of the slightly diﬀerent populations suggested above. In the latter case, the collisional shift is cancelled and
this gives a better fringe contrast and a smaller frequency shift. The improvement of fringe amplitude is due to the
fact that the diﬀerence in the phase of the condensates is space-independent as the collisional shift is cancelled.

The remaining frequency shift is now due to kinetic and Zeeman shift. The frequency shift due to the kinetic term,

is small because it is proportional to the diﬀerence of the square of the size of each condensate and this diﬀerence is
small. The shift due to the kinetic terms is proportional to the diﬀerence of the square of the width of the spectral
density of each condensate. As the size of the condensates and the width of their spectral density change in time, the
shifts are time dependent.

V. CONCLUSION

We modeled a microwave frequency atomic clock using a conﬁguration of BEC atoms in a highly elongated magnetic
12
trap. We showed that the stability of the clock is 2.6
10−
Tc/τ for a trap radial frequency ωr/2π = 120 Hz and
axial frequency ωz/2π = 0.5 Hz. The performance of the clock is related to the conﬁguration of the trap and can
be improved by running the clock with an even weaker axial trapping frequency. We found a dynamical instability
that results in phase separation and limits the clock stability and accuracy if a long interrogation time is used. We
considered optimization of the experimental parameters maximize the stability and accuracy of the clock. For a 87Rb
BEC, the collisional shift terms can be cancelled by playing them oﬀ against each other by adjusting the population
in the ground and excited states with the Ramsey pulses so that the problem of density ﬂuctuations does not strongly
aﬀect the stability and the accuracy of the clock.

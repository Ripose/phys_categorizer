We have produced ultracold heteronuclear KRb molecules by the process of photoassociation in
a two-species magneto-optical trap. Following decay of the photoassociated KRb*, the molecules
are detected using two-photon ionization and time-of-ﬂight mass spectroscopy of KRb+. A portion
of the metastable triplet molecules thus formed are magnetically trapped. Photoassociative spectra
down to 91 cm−1 below the K(4s) + Rb (5p1/2) asymptote have been obtained. We have made
assignments to all eight of the attractive Hund’s case (c) KRb* potential curves in this spectral
region.

Following in the footsteps of ultracold atoms, the study
of ultracold molecules has seen signiﬁcant progress in re-
cent years [1]. Homonuclear molecules have been pro-
duced at ultracold temperatures, here deﬁned as T < 1
mK, by photoassociating ultracold atoms [2, 3].
In a
few cases, the resulting molecules have been subsequently
trapped [4, 5]. Feshbach resonances in even colder atomic
samples have yielded very weakly bound homonuclear
molecules [6], in some cases under quantum degenerate
conditions. Heteronuclear polar molecules have attracted
particular interest because their permanent dipole mo-
ments can be controlled with external ﬁelds. At ultra-
cold temperatures, the resulting long-range, anisotropic
dipole-dipole interactions are expected to lead to new
phenomena, such as anisotropic collisions [7] and novel
quantum degenerate behavior [8, 9, 10]. Heteronuclear
photoassociative spectroscopy [11] is also of interest, and
applications of ultracold polar molecules to quantum
computing [12] and fundamental symmetries [13] are also
being considered.

In this Letter, we report on the production, detection,
magnetic trapping, and photoassociation spectroscopy of
KRb molecules. This work builds on a variety of other
recent advances, particularly the recent production and
spectroscopic study of ultracold polar RbCs molecules by
Kerman and coworkers [14, 15], using photoassociation
(PA) in overlapping Rb and Cs magneto-optical traps
(MOTs). Similar PA spectroscopy has been performed
with the heteronuclear (but nonpolar) 6Li7Li molecule
[16].
In other related work, observations of ultracold
NaCs+ [17], RbCs [18], and KRb [19] have been reported
in two-species MOTs, although the formation mecha-
nisms have not been identiﬁed. Heteronuclear Feshbach
resonances have been recently reported in Li+Na [20] and
K+Rb [21], although the resulting molecules were not
directly observed. At temperatures above 10 mK, po-

lar molecules have been successfully cooled and trapped.
CaH has been buﬀer-gas cooled and magnetically trapped
[22], while ND3 has been electrostatically slowed and
loaded into electric traps [23, 24].

Photoassociation, as shown in Figure 1, involves the
free-bound absorption of a photon by a colliding pair of
atoms [2, 3]. It is a particularly powerful spectroscopic
technique at µK temperatures, where only a few partial
waves contribute, as the centrifugal barriers of collision
are signiﬁcantly greater than the thermal kinetic energy
for quite low collisional angular momenta (ℓ . 3). Thus
the bound states formed are also limited to low rotational
angular momenta (J . 4 ).

In our experiments,

electronically excited KRb*
molecules are produced by PA in overlapping K and Rb
MOTs, followed by radiative stabilization via decay to
the ground X 1Σ+ state or the metastable a3Σ+ state.
Dark-spot MOTs are used to achieve high atomic densi-
ties, and ionization detection is employed for improved
sensitivity. We are able to observe trapping of ultracold
heteronuclear molecules for the ﬁrst time, by conﬁning
triplet KRb molecules in the inhomogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld of the MOT. We also present high-resolution pho-
toassociative spectra down to 91 cm−1 below the K(4s)
+ Rb (5p1/2) asymptote. In these spectra we have iden-
tiﬁed transitions to all eight of the attractive long-range
potentials converging to 4s + 5p1/2 and 4s + 5p3/2.

Our 39K/85Rb dual species MOT [25] uses the same
apparatus previously used for trapping 39K [26] with the
addition of trap and repump beams for 85Rb. Frequently
the K and Rb diode laser beams can share optics, because
of the closeness of the resonance energies (see Fig. 1).
Indeed it is this near degeneracy which makes the KRb
C6 values especially large [11]. Normally we operate each
of the atom traps as a “dark-spot” MOT [27], with typical
densities of 1011/cm3 for Rb and 3 × 1010/cm3 for K. The

glet (X1Σ+) and triplet (a3Σ+) molecule formation processes
in KRb based on the ab initio potential energy curves of Ref.
[29]. In (b), the long-range states converging to 4s + 5pJ are
shown; the state designations consist of an ordinal number-
ing followed by the Hund’s case (c) symmetry in parenthe-
ses, expressed as Ω± . The long-range states converging to
4pJ + 5s1/2 (not shown) are all repulsive.

two MOTs are carefully aligned to maximize overlap of
the two atomic clouds.

To achieve sensitive and species-selective detection we
employ two-photon ionization at 602.5 nm followed by
time-of-ﬂight mass spectroscopy, an example of which is
shown in the inset of Fig. 2. The ionizing laser pulse (1.5
mJ, ∼10 ns) is focused to provide a typical peak intensity
of 7 × 106 W/cm2. These pulses are generated using a
doubled Nd:YAG laser at 532nm to pump a pulsed dye
laser at 10Hz. Ion signals can also be obtained using a 532
nm laser directly. A Channeltron is used to detect atomic
and molecular ions. We obtain PA spectra by tuning a
cw tunable PA laser (Coherent 829-29, typically > 400
mW) while detecting the KRb+ time-of-ﬂight peak.

We obtain typical signals of 10-60 KRb+ ions per
laser shot when the PA laser is tuned to a strong KRb
resonance. Surprisingly, these signals are comparable
to the Rb+
ion signals observed when photoassociat-

Delay before ionization (ms)

FIG. 2: Main panel: Time evolution of the 39K85Rb+ signal
as a function of the delay of the ionization pulse relative to
the turnoﬀ of the PA laser, with the PA laser set to a 3(0−)
state resonance as indicated in Fig. 3(a). PA laser detuning

ing on a strong Rb2 line. The number of colliding
atom pairs available at the Condon radius, where the
PA laser matches the ground-excited free-bound transi-
tion, strongly favors Rb2. Its resonant-dipole 1/R3 po-
tentials permit photoassociation at much longer range
(e.g., 100 a0) compared to KRb where the van der Waals
1/R6 potential results in shorter-range excitation (e.g.,
30 a0). However, the Franck-Condon factors for decay
to the 1/R6 ground-state potentials strongly favor KRb.
Therefore we expect to produce less KRb* in the PA step,
but with more eﬃcient decay to a bound state. This is
reﬂected in the barely detectable KRb trap loss signal
we observe in contrast to losses of 10-50% for Rb2. Also,
the relaxed heteronuclear selection rules allow more PA
pathways in KRb compared to Rb2 [11]. The signal sizes
may also be inﬂuenced by diﬀerent detection eﬃciencies
for the KRb and Rb2. Finally, the signal sizes may be en-
hanced by magnetic trapping, discussed below. Ignoring
this trapping and assuming 100% ionization eﬃciency for
KRb and 50% ion detection eﬃciency, our maximum sig-
nal size would correspond to a production rate of about
4 × 104 KRb molecules/s.

We observe trapping of triplet KRb molecules in the
magnetic ﬁeld of the MOT coils [5]. These molecules
must be in the triplet a state since the singlet molecules
have zero magnetic moment. We can investigate the trap-
ping by turning oﬀ the PA laser while leaving the MOT
lasers and magnetic ﬁeld on, then ﬁring the detection
laser pulse after a variable delay time. Figure 2 shows a
decay curve observed as a function of this delay, with the
laser tuned to one of the stronger KRb resonances (the

brational bands as our PA laser is scanned as indicated below
the K(4s) + Rb(5p1/2) asymptote. The tentative state desig-
nation is given for each band using the nomenclature of Fig
1(b). The rotational spacings vary widely, with smaller spac-
ings corresponding to longer-range states. This spectrum in-
cludes transitions to seven of the eight states correlating with
the J = 1/2 and J = 3/2 asymptotes. All these states can be
reached by dipole-allowed transitions from colliding ground
state atoms (Ω = 0±, 1). (b) A high-resolution PA spectrum
showing the rotational structure as the PA laser detuning is

3(0−) transition marked with an arrow in Fig. 3(a)). The
background of 1.7 ions/shot due to KRb formed in the
absence of the PA laser [19] has been subtracted from
this decay curve. A signiﬁcant fraction of the molecules
survive long past the ballistic decay time, which is about
3 ms for our 1 mm diameter detection beam, assuming a
temperature of ∼300 µK. The trapped molecules appear
to decay non-exponentially, with a small signal still ob-
servable after 150 ms. Because the atoms in the MOT
are unpolarized, we expect the molecules to have a wide
distribution of projection quantum numbers (mJ or mF ,
depending on the coupling scheme), giving rise to a large
spread in the eﬀective trapping potential. For a molecule
with the largest possible magnetic dipole moment projec-
tion of two Bohr magnetons (2µB = qe~/me), the hori-
zontal trapping potential reaches a depth of 500 µK with
a radius of 2.5 mm. The vertical potential is slightly dis-
torted by gravity, but the magnetic trapping force is 2.5
times larger than the gravitational force. Molecules with
smaller magnetic dipole moment projections will experi-

3

ence weaker trapping, and can be expected to be con-
ﬁned in a larger trap volume, with a higher escape rate
and lower detection eﬃciency. At least 2/3 of the total
molecules formed will be untrapped or anti-trapped.

Examples of our heteronuclear PA spectra are given
in Figure 3. The observed linewidths vary from about
35-500 MHz, primarily due to unresolved internal struc-
ture. The excellent signal-to-noise ratio makes the spec-
tra readily assignable. At these low J values, rotational
series such as the one shown in Fig. 3(b) are ﬁt precisely
by a linear plot of energy versus (J(J + 1) − Ω2), yielding
a rotational constant Bv without observable centrifugal
distortion. The four 0± states (two of each), the three
Ω = 1 states, and the sole Ω = 2 state are readily as-
signed in this way. Our ± assignments are preliminary
because of extensive perturbations [28]. These eﬀects are
evident in Fig. 4, which plots the vibrational energies
and Bv values for one of the 0+ states. We make nominal
assignments by associating the state having the smaller
C6 coeﬃcient with the shorter outer turning point and
therefore the larger rotational constant. Thus the se-
ries in Figure 4 is assigned to the 0+ state at the K(4s)
+ Rb(5p1/2) asymptote, i.e. the 2(0+) state of Figure
1(b). Figure 3(b) in particular corresponds to the ninth
observed vibrational level in the Figure 4 series. There
are eight vibrational levels in Figure 3a, assigned as 0 or
1 states depending on their lowest rotational quantum
number (J = 0 or 1). One of the 0 levels corresponds to
the 11th level in the 2(0+) series in Fig. 4. Two other 0
levels must correspond to 2(0−), with a vibrational spac-
ing comparable to 2(0+) at this detuning. The ﬁnal two
0 levels, with larger vibrational spacings, are assigned
to the 3(0−) and 3(0+) states, respectively, in order of
increasing Bv.

In a similar way, among the three Ω = 1 levels, one
(with Bv = 8.49 × 10−3 cm−1) ﬁts well in a long vibra-
tional series, similar to the 2(0+) series in Fig. 4, and is
assigned to the 2(1) state. The other two levels cannot be
in the 2(1) series and are assigned to the 3(1) and the 4(1)
states based on their relative rotational constants (10.39
and 10.93 × 10−3 cm−1, respectively). Since four vibra-
tional levels of the 1(2) state have also been observed at
other detunings, we have been able to observe all eight
of the Hund’s case (c) electronic states correlating to the
K(4s) + Rb(5p1/2, 3/2) asymptotes, as shown in Fig 1(b).
Further discussion of these assignments will be published
elsewhere [28].

Due to our ion extraction conﬁguration, the molecules
are formed in a dc ﬁeld of ∼160V/cm. We observe no
Stark eﬀect at our spectral resolution of ∼0.001 cm−1,
consistent with the small dipole moment (<0.04 ea0) pre-
dicted for KRb* [29, 30, 31, 32]. This diﬀers from the
RbCs case of Ref. [14], where both the ﬁeld (390 V/cm)
and the dipole moment (∼0.5 ea0) are larger. We note
that the dipole moments of the X 1Σ+ and a3Σ+ states
of KRb at their equilibrium separations are -0.30(2) and

Assuming our assignments are correct for the 2(0+),
2(0−), and 2(1) states, one can estimate the correspond-
ing eﬀective C6 values [34, 35] as (1.06 ± 0.06) × 105,
(1.01 ± 0.04) × 105 and (1.01 ± 0.05) × 105 atomic units
(a.u.), respectively. Note that C6 is a weak function of
R between very long-range (spin-orbit ≫ dispersion) and
intermediate range (dispersion ≫ spin-orbit)—the calcu-
lations of [36], for example, vary from 1.0 × 105 a.u. at
very long range to 3.1 × 105 a.u. at intermediate range
for the 2(0+) state. Model calculations to better deﬁne
the dispersion interaction are underway.

It is important to consider the eﬀects of symmetry on
molecule formation. Some relevant transition dipole mo-
ment functions are available [33]. For levels near dissoci-
ation, all of the excited states we produce decay with
at least 78% probability to the a3Σ+ state.
In fact,
the 2(0−), 3(0−), and 1(2) states radiate 100% to this
triplet state. Thus, since we observe KRb+ from 0− and
2 states, we know our ion detection is sensitive to triplet
molecules. However, since even the 0+ and 1 states ra-
diate primarily to triplet states at long range, we do not
yet know if our ionization detection is sensitive to singlet
molecules. We hope that in future experiments where
both singlet and triplet molecules are produced but only
triplets are trapped, we can determine the relative sensi-
tivity for singlet and triplet molecule detection.

In summary, we have signiﬁcantly advanced the study
of ultracold polar molecules, trapping them for the ﬁrst
time. KRb molecules are produced by high-resolution
photoassociation and detected by ionization. We have ex-
tensively explored the PA spectrum, identifying all eight
of the electronic states expected near the K(4s) + Rb(5p)
limits.

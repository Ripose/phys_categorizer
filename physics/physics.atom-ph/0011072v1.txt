I. INTRODUCTION

Metastable helium has been the subject of many experimental investigations at cold and
ultracold temperatures [1–26] and there have also been several theoretical studies [27–32].
Much of this interest has been stimulated by the prospect of obtaining a Bose-Einstein
condensate with spin-polarized metastable helium 2 3S atoms [2,14,30,31]. We denote a
He(2 3S) atom by the symbol He∗. The Penning ionization (PI) and associative ionization
(AI) processes,

He∗ + He∗ →

He + He+ + e−

have high threshold rates in an unpolarized gas and limit the achievable density of trapped
atoms. However, these autoionization processes are spin-forbidden and suppressed [31,32]
from the spin-polarized state and only via the weak spin-dipole interaction can such processes
can occur. Consequently, a suﬃcient number of spin-polarized metastable atoms should
remain trapped. In addition, the scattering length associated with the quintet potential,
which controls the collision dynamics of spin-polarized metastable helium atoms, is predicted
to be large and positive, a necessary requirement for a stable Bose-Einstein condensate.
Although some theoretical studies [29–31] have estimated the scattering length associated
with the quintet potential to be large and positive, no detailed study of the scattering lengths
for metastable helium has been previously undertaken. This present investigation not only
calculates the possible ranges of values for the scattering lengths directly associated with the
molecular potentials, but also reports experimentally observable scattering lengths, elastic
cross sections and inelastic rate constants for collisions of metastable helium atoms in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld.

For this theoretical investigation we have chosen to simulate the Penning and associative
ionization processes that occur at small internuclear separations from the singlet and triplet
molecular states by a complex optical potential. The complex interaction potentials then
have the form 2S+1V (R) − 1
2i 2S+1Γ(R), where R is the internuclear separation of the two
atoms, 2S+1V (R) is the usual adiabatic molecular potential for the molecular state 2S+1Σ+
g,u
with total spin S, and 2S+1Γ(R) is the corresponding total autoionization width represent-
ing ﬂux loss due to the ionization processes. Since the Penning and associative ionization
processes are spin-forbidden from the quintet state, 5Γ(R) = 0.

The adiabatic molecular potentials required in this investigation for the 1Σ+
u and
5Σ+
g molecular states were constructed using data from various sources. The long-range
interaction potential was described by a multipole expansion of the form −C6/R6 − C8/R8 −
C10/R10 using the most accurate dispersion coeﬃcients available for the He(2 3S)–He(2 3S)
interaction [33]. The short-range 1Σ+
u molecular potentials and their corresponding
autoionization widths for Penning and associative ionization were obtained from M¨uller et
al. [35], while the short-range 5Σ+
g molecular potential was taken from St¨arck and Meyer [34].
The 5Σ+
g potential was reported with an uncertainty of 0.5% in the repulsive part of the
potential and 1% in the attractive part of the potential.

The molecular potentials for metastable helium were constructed by ﬁtting the three
short-range potentials smoothly onto the long-range dispersion interaction. The uncertain-
ties in the short-range potentials, the procedure used to connect these to the long-range

potential, and the form used for the autoionization widths lead to uncertainties in the
scattering lengths for the 1Σ+
g potentials and subsequently to the ultracold
scattering properties of metastable helium atoms. To determine the extent of these uncer-
tainties we vary the short-range potentials by ±2.5% for ﬁve diﬀerent interaction potentials
which use diﬀerent methods to connect the long-range and short-range potentials or have
diﬀerent forms of the autoionization widths. We have chosen to vary the short-range poten-
tial by more than their stated uncertainty to ensure that we obtain conservative estimates
for the range of scattering lengths.
The ﬁrst of these potentials,

smoothly onto the long-range potential at R ≈ 20 a0. The 1Σ+
u molecular po-
tentials of Ref. [35] are used for R < 11.5 a0 and for larger R, where the electronic structure
calculations become inaccurate, we replace the potentials by 5V (R) − Vexch(R). The ex-
change term has the form Vexch(R) = A2S+1Rγ exp(−βR), where γ = 4.91249, β = 1.183933,
A1 = 6.3245 × 10−3 and A3 = 4.6317 × 10−3. The autoionization widths 2S+1ΓM(R) of Ref.
[35] were used to represent the Penning and associative ionization processes.

Potential (B) is identical to (A) except that the short-range 5Σ+

long-range potential at R ≈ 35 a0. Potential (C) is identical to (A) except that the ex-
change term has the form Vexch(R) = A2S+1 exp(−βR) with β = 0.704921, A1 = 4.29808
and A3 = 3.14764. Potentials (D) and (E) are identical to (A) but employ diﬀerent forms for
the autoionization widths. The autoionization width ΓGMS(R) = 0.3 exp(−R/1.086), given
by Garrison et al. [36], is used in (D). This autoionization width has a steeper exponential
form which doesn’t dampen at small internuclear separations like 1ΓM(R) or 3ΓM(R). Po-
tential (E) uses another alternative form of the autoionization widths which was arbitrarily
constructed to assess the sensitivity of the calculated results to the form of Γ(R) and is given
by:

All the molecular potentials considered have the same long-range form since the uncertainties
in the long-range multipole potential were found to have a negligible eﬀect on the scattering
lengths. The potentials (A) to (E) with unmodiﬁed short-range forms possess the same
number of bound states, calculated to be 28 for 1Σ+

the Hamiltonian, and subsequent ﬁtting to free-ﬁeld boundary conditions provides a complex
K-matrix and corresponding non-unitary S-matrix (SS), as described previously [31]. The
complex phase shift ηS, deﬁned by SS = exp(i2ηS), can then be used to calculate the complex

where the scattering lengths are deﬁned by ηS = −k a2S+1 and the superscripts ‘re’ and ‘im’
denote real and imaginary components, respectively.

The scattering lengths for the three molecular states were calculated as a function of
the percentage variation in the corresponding short-range molecular potential for the ﬁve
potential cases (A) to (E) and are displayed in Fig. 1. For the a5 scattering length only the
results for potential (A) are plotted because the 5Σ+
g potentials are identical for potential
cases (A), (C), (D) and (E) and the results obtained with potential (B) diﬀered by less than
5%. The a5 scattering length has no imaginary component since the Penning process is
spin-forbidden from the S = 2 molecular state. Of particular interest is the resonance in
a5 at a percentage variation of ≈ 1.875 where the short-range potential is made suﬃciently
shallow that a bound state is removed from the 5Σ+
g potential. For percentage variations
> 1.875 it is found that a5 is negative in contradiction to recent experimental evidence that
a5 is large and positive [37]. With potentials (A) and (B) the scattering lengths a1 and a3
were nearly identical and are denoted by a single solid curve.

The scattering lengths associated with the molecular potentials are not observable ex-
perimentally, with the exception of a5, which is approximately equal to the scattering length
for the spin-polarized state. However, these scattering lengths provide unique parameteri-
zation of the 1Σ+
g potentials, from which the threshold scattering properties
of metastable helium atoms can be obtained. Of more practical interest are the scattering
lengths for collisions between atoms in given atomic states in the presence of a magnetic
ﬁeld.

III. COLLISIONS IN THE PRESENCE OF A MAGNETIC FIELD

To study collisions in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld a full multichannel scattering
calculation must be undertaken. The details of such a quantum-mechanical multichannel
scattering model for metastable helium is described elsewhere [31]. In brief, we perform the
present calculations for atoms in initial atomic states α and β, including both s and d-waves,
and calculate the full non-unitary S-matrix which has elements Sα,β,l;α′,β′,l′. Here we let α
and β denote the atomic states (s, ms), where ms is the space-ﬁxed projection of the spin s
for an individual atom.

For collision energies up to 100 µK the contributions of entrance p and d-waves are
negligible (note that due to symmetrization p-waves only contribute in collisions between

4

atoms in diﬀerent atomic states), so that only the s-wave entrance channel [α, β], l = 0 needs
to be considered. The elastic cross section σel
α,β are then given by [38]

α,β and inelastic rate K inel

where v is the relative atomic velocity. In the Wigner threshold region (ka << 1) one can
deﬁne the scattering lengths using ηα,β = −kaα,β and obtain expressions for the observable
scattering lengths aα,β by replacing SS with the matrix element Sα,β,l=0;α,β,l=0 in Eq. (4).
The elastic cross sections and inelastic rates can then be obtained using

The inelastic rate K inel
α,β includes both contributions from the ﬂux loss due to Penning ion-
ization and that due to the atoms exiting in diﬀerent atomic states. Since we calculate the
full S-matrix, the contributions of these two processes can be easily separated. We note that
for (1, 1) + (1, 1), (1, 1) + (1, 0), (1, −1) + (1, −1) or (1, −1) + (1, 0) collisions, where the
total projection of the spin (M) is non-zero, the collision is dominated by the 5Σ+
g potential
and inelastic processes can only occur via the weak relativistic spin-dipole interaction. The
scattering lengths for these states are then almost identical to a5 but with a small imaginary
component. The properties of (1, 1)+(1, 1) collisions were investigated in detail in a previous
paper [31]. The inelastic rates for (1, 0) + (1, 0) and (1, 1) + (1, −1) collisions, from which
ionization can occur directly via strong exchange forces, are much larger and dominate the
total inelastic rate for an unpolarized gas.

The (1, 0) + (1, 0) and (1, 1) + (1, −1) inelastic rates contain two diﬀerent contributions.

The ﬁrst is due to exothermic inelastic processes which includes the Penning rate K P
α,β
and the much smaller collision rate for exothermic ﬁne-structure changing collisions K ex
α,β.
The second is the rate for degenerate ﬁne-structure changing collisions K deg
α,β . For example,
in ultracold (1, 0) + (1, 0) collisions the entrance channel [(1, 0) + (1, 0)], l = 0 can decay
exothermically to the three channels [(1, −1) + (1, −1)], l = 2; [(1, 0) + (1, −1)], l = 2 and the
Penning channel, and to the two degenerate channels [(1, 1) + (1, −1)], l = 0 and [(1, 1) +
(1, −1)], l = 2. The ﬂux loss to the degenerate d-wave exit channels or exothermic d-wave exit
channels (ie K P) only occurs via weak spin-dipole forces and is at least 3 orders of magnitude
smaller than that lost to the Penning channel or to degenerate l = 0 exit channels that occurs
through strong exchange forces. Importantly, exothermic and degenerate inelastic processes
exhibit diﬀerent threshold properties. Exothermic inelastic rates tend to a constant in the
Wigner threshold region whereas degenerate inelastic rates fall oﬀ as 1/k since, as for elastic
processes, the incident and ﬁnal wave number are identical. To represent these separate
threshold behaviors in the inelastic rates, we write aim
. The slope and
intercept of ln(Sα,β,l=0;α,β,l=0S†
α,β,l=0;α,β,l=0)/4k vs k, for k in the Wigner threshold region,
then gives the degenerate and exothermic scattering lengths aimdeg
α,β , respectively.
We have calculated these imaginary and the real scattering lengths for all possible col-
lision processes in spin-polarized metastable helium for the ﬁve diﬀerent potentials under

investigation. From these calculated scattering lengths one can use Eq. (6) to calculate
the partial rates or the total rates in an unpolarized gas at temperatures where the Wigner
threshold approximation is valid. The scattering lengths are calculated assuming a magnetic
ﬁeld of 10 Gauss, however we ﬁnd only a weak dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld and results
for ﬁelds in the range 0 to 20 Gauss diﬀer by less than 1%. The scattering lengths can be
used to calculate the rates and cross sections up to typically ≈ 100 µK, except where the
scattering lengths become > 1000 a0.

g and 1Σ+

g and 1Σ+

Scattering lengths for (1, 0) + (1, 0) and (1, 1) + (1, −1) collisions (with s and d-waves)
depend on both the 5Σ+
g potentials and so their scattering lengths are a function of
both the percentage variation of the short-range 5Σ+
g potentials for potential cases
(A) to (E). However, we ﬁnd that for a given percentage variation of the 5Σ+
g potential the
uncertainty in the scattering lengths induced by varying the short-range 1Σ+
g potential by
±2.5% is similar to that calculated by ﬁxing the percentage variation in the 1Σ+
g potential
to zero and using the ﬁve diﬀerent potential cases (A) to (E). In all instances the percentage
variation in the 5Σ+
g potential has the largest eﬀect on the scattering lengths and resulting
rates. The (1, 1) + (1, 1), (1, 1) + (1, 0), (1, −1) + (1, −1) or (1, −1) + (1, 0) interactions
depend only weakly on the singlet potential via the weak relativistic spin-dipole interaction
and we ﬁnd that varying the short-range 1Σ+
g potential for these collisions produces negligible
changes in the scattering length. Therefore we only report scattering lengths as a function
of the percentage variation in the 5Σ+
g potential for potential cases (A) to (E), with the
understanding that similar uncertainties result in the (1, 0) + (1, 0) and (1, 1) + (1, −1)
scattering lengths by varying the short-range singlet potential.

g potential. The underlying 5Σ+

Figures 2, 3 and 4 show the real and imaginary scattering lengths for (1, 1)+(1, 1), (1, 0)+
(1, 0) and (1, 1) + (1, −1) collisions. The real scattering lengths all possess a resonance in
the region where a bound state is removed from the 5Σ+
g potential and a5 goes through ±∞.
Similar plots exist for (1, 1) + (1, 0), (1, −1) + (1, −1) and (1, −1) + (1, 0) collisions but are
almost identical to that shown in Fig. 2 for (1, 1) + (1, 1) since all are dominated by the
5Σ+
g potentials are identical for potential cases (A), (C), (D)
and (E) and we found that are
(1,1),(1,1) calculated with these potentials diﬀered from those
obtained using potential (B) by less than 2%. These small diﬀerences are not observable on
the scale used in Fig. 2 and so for clarity a single solid curve is used to represent are
(1,1),(1,1)
for the ﬁve potential cases. Similarly for aimex
(1,1),(1,1) the results were identical except for cases
(D) and (E) where diﬀerent forms of the autoionisation widths were used, and so we show
only results for (A), (D) and (E) potential cases. We note that imaginary scattering lengths
for collisions where the total spin projection is non-zero possess no degenerate component
and the exothermic contributions are negligible when compared to those for (1, 0) + (1, 0)
and (1, 1) + (1, −1) collisions where Penning ionization can occur via exchange forces.

For (1, 0) + (1, 0) and (1, 1) + (1, −1) collisions are in Fig. 3 were almost identical for the
ﬁve potential cases and are represented by a single solid curve for (1, 0) + (1, 0) and a dashed
curve for (1, 1)+(1, −1). In Fig. 4 we show aimex and aimdeg for these collisions. The scattering
lengths aimex, which measure K P
α,β, are independent of the percentage variation in
the 5Σ+
g potential and thus a5, except very near the a5 resonance where the contribution
from K ex
α,β is no longer negligible and a small increase in aimex
is observable. Therefore,

The curves labeled aimdeg in Fig. 4 provide the degenerate temperature-dependent in-
elastic rates for either (1, 0) + (1, 0) → (1, 1) + (1, −1) or (1, 1) + (1, −1) → (1, 0) + (1, 0).
These equal, exchange-dominated rates strongly mix the (1, 1), (1, 0) and (1, −1) atoms and
are equal to, or larger than, K P at temperatures greater than 500 µK or when the quintet
potential is near resonance. Of the potentials tested only those with very diﬀerent exchange
terms provided signiﬁcantly diﬀerent results and consequently aimdeg for potentials (A), (B),
(D) and (E) were nearly identical. For convenience only aimdeg
(1,0),(1,0) for potentials (A) and (C)
have been plotted in Fig.4.

The elastic cross section depends on the real and imaginary scattering lengths and its
measurement in a spin-polarized or unpolarized gas may provide useful information on a5.
In Figs. 5–8 we provide the total elastic cross sections and Penning ionization rates for
(1, 1) + (1, 1) collisions and for an unpolarized gas calculated using Potential (A). Also
shown are unthermalized results for 1 µK and 500 µK calculated from the scattering lengths
using Eq.(6). In general the results obtained using Eq.(6) for temperatures up to 100 µK
are identical to the thermalized results whereas at higher temperatures, outside the Wigner
regime, the use of scattering lengths is inappropriate and thermalization is required. The
rate equations

deﬁne our unthermalized partial rates for, respectively, identical and non-identical atom
collisions, where nα is the number of colliding atoms in state α and the superscript ‘inel’
denotes ‘P’, ‘ex’ or ‘deg’. The total thermalized Penning rates and cross sections for an
unpolarized gas are obtained assuming an equal population of the s = 1 ﬁne structure levels
so that nα = n/3 and hence

where h...i denotes the thermal average. In this case the assumption that the ﬁne structure
levels are evenly populated in an unpolarized gas is well justiﬁed on collisional grounds. At
temperatures above 500 µK the degenerate rates K imdeg evenly mix (1, 1), (1, 0) and (1, −1)
atoms. At lower temperatures the Penning rates K P
(1,1),(1,−1), which dominate
the exothermic inelastic rates, deplete the three diﬀerent atomic populations nα equally since
2K P

(1,1),(1,−1), and assume that any initial asymmetry in the populations nα due to preparation
of the atoms in a light ﬁeld for instance is small or has become small once the measurement
of the collisional rate in the absence of light is performed. The thermalized results were
calculated by averaging over a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of atomic velocity using 71
velocity nodes which correspond to collision energies in the range 0.01 µK to 10, 000 µK.
Since the results are for the case (A) potentials, with the percentage variation in the singlet
potential set to zero, we estimate from the uncertainties in the scattering lengths that the
errors in the elastic cross sections and total inelastic rates are of the order of 10% and 40%
respectively. The Penning rates possess a larger uncertainty to account for the percentage
variation of the 1Σ+
g potential whereas the unpolarized elastic rates, which are dominated
by the real scattering lengths belonging to collisions with M = 2 or 1, are controlled only
by 5Σ+
g .

In an unpolarized gas the p-waves can contribute in (1, 1) + (1, −1), (1, 1) + (1, 0) and
(1, −1) + (1, 0) collisions. These contributions to the total thermalized Penning rates were
found to be negligible at 1 µK. However the p-wave contributions increased the total Penning
rate (compared to that obtained using only s-waves) by approximately 7% at 500 µK and
12% at 1 mK. The p-waves modiﬁed the total elastic cross sections by less than 1% at all
temperatures.

For (1, 1) + (1, 1) collisions (and similarly for (1, 1) + (1, 0), (1, −1) + (1, −1) or (1, −1) +
(1, 0)) we observe a resonance in the inelastic rates at a percentage variation of +1.875

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The scattering lengths associated with the three molecular potentials relevant to colli-
sions of metastable helium atoms have been reported. The uncertainties in the molecular
potentials and autoionization widths have been considered and probable ranges of values
given for the scattering lengths for each molecular state. Scattering lengths for collisions
involving the various atomic states have also been calculated and related to the elastic cross
sections and inelastic collision rates for temperatures in the Wigner threshold region, with
the aim of providing a correspondence with experimentally measurable quantities. In par-
ticular, it has been shown that measurement of the total elastic cross section in a polarized
or unpolarized gas should provide a means of experimentally determining the a5 scattering
length, which is of importance in the attainment of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a gas of
spin-polarized metastable helium atoms.

In Fig. 8 we compare the total Penning rates calculated here to those from experiment.
Not shown are the theoretical uncertainties of ≈ 40% which arise from uncertainties in the
molecular potentials and in the form of the autoionization widths. The total elastic cross

diﬀerent molecular potentials and autoionization widths were used. The experimental results
possess uncertainties on the order of 50% which are not shown in Fig. 8. The experimental
results correspond to the case of zero magnetic ﬁeld whereas the theoretical predictions
are made for B = 10 G. However the scattering lengths were found to vary by less than
1% over the range 0–20 G which is negligible when compared to these uncertainties that
arise from the form of the autoionization width. The comparison between theoretical and
experimental data is satisfactory given these uncertainties, however the experimental results
are consistently higher than the theoretical predictions.

Finally, using the scattering lengths reported in this investigation, one can estimate the
scattering lengths for the other isotopes of helium by mass scaling the vibrational defect.
This is related to the scattering length by [39]

where νS(0) is the vibrational defect and t is deﬁned by the leading term −Ct/Rt in the long-
range potential (t = 6 for He). The term ∂ν
∂κ|κ→0 is an asymptotic property which depends
only on the long-range potential and can be approximated by 0.956 × 0.5(2µC6)0.25 ≈ 35
for He [40]. To mass scale the vibrational defect we ﬁrst calculate νS(0) for 4He for a given
potential. Since the trigonometric function is periodic, this only gives the fractional part of
the vibrational defect and one must include the multiple of nπ where n is the number of
bound states supported by that potential, ie νS(0) → nπ + νS(0). This vibrational defect
can then be scaled using (µx/µ4)0.5 × νS(0), to determine the vibrational defect for isotope
x. Here µx and µ4 are the reduced masses of xHe and 4He respectively.

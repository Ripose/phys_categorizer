Abstract. -Mapping equations of motion of the highly exited classical atom in a monochromatic
ﬁeld are generalized for the two-frequency microwave ﬁeld. Analysis of the obtained equations
indicates to the weak sensitivity of the position of the recently observed ionization peak near the
main resonance to the frequency and amplitude of the additional microwave ﬁeld.
In the high
frequency region, however, the sensitivity of the enhanced ionization peaks on the additional ﬁeld
frequency is predicted.

At present studies of the highly excited atoms in an intense electromagnetic ﬁeld attract a
large amount of eﬀort. The Rydberg atom in a monochromatic ﬁeld is one of the simplest real
quasiclassical systems with stochastic behavior which may be investigated both theoretically and
experimentally [1]-[3]. Classical regular motion and the stochastic dynamics of the excited electron
in the monochromatic ﬁeld resulting in the diﬀusion-like excitation and ionization processes may
be described by the map, called the ’Kepler map’ [2]-[6]. This greatly facilitates numerical and
analytical investigations of transition to the stochasticity and ionization process. It appears that,
although the derivation of the Kepler map is based on the classical perturbation theory, the map
is, nevertheless, suitable even for the low frequency ﬁeld when at transition to the chaotic behavior
the strength of the ionizing ﬁeld is comparable with the Coulomb ﬁeld [6].

The main objective of the present work is to derive and investigate the mapping equations of the
motion for the highly excited atom in two- and multi-frequency ﬁelds. The urgency of this problem
follows also from the experimental and theoretical investigations [7], where nonmonotonic behavior
(peak) in the two-frequency ionization has been observed. The relatively simple mapping form of
the equations of motion allows theoretical investigation and predictions of similar peculiarities for
diﬀerent parameters of the problem.

We start from the minimal coupling [6] of the electromagnetic ﬁeld to the electron through the
A · P interaction where A is the vector potential of the ﬁeld and P is the generalized momentum
of the electron. From the Hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom in a linearly polarized total external
ﬁeld FT we can obtain an equation for the electron energy E change due to the interaction with
this ﬁeld [4]-[6]

˙E = −˙r · FT .

where Fk, ωk and ϑk are the amplitudes, frequencies and phases of the ﬁeld components, respec-
tively. Further for the simplicity we restrict ourselves to the two-frequency ﬁeld parallel to the
x-axis

FT = F cos(ωt + ϑ) + F2 cos(ω2t + ϑ2)

and consider widely used in theoretical analysis [2]-[8] the one-dimensional model which corresponds
to the states very extended along the electric ﬁeld direction. We remain the same usual [4]-[6], [8]
notation for the parameters of ﬁrst (referee) ﬁeld, i.e. F, ω and ϑ without the subscripts, while the
second ﬁeld parameters supply with subscripts 2.

To minimize the number of the free parameters it is convenient [5]-[6], [8] to introduce some
scaled and relative quantities: the scaled energy ε = −2E/ω2/3, the relative ﬁeld strengths F0= F n4

κ = ω/ω2 = s/s2 is the ratio of two microwave frequencies while s and s2 are the ratios between the

and integrating eq. (1) for the electron motion between two subsequent passages at the aphelion

values of the variables.

The ﬁrst equation of the map (5) contains two terms corresponding to the change of the elec-
tron’s scaled energy during the intrinsic motion period by the inﬂuence of two ﬁeld components,
respectively, while the second equation follows from the requirement of the area-preserving of the
map. Note also that expression κ2/3εj+1(= −2Ej+1/ω2/3
2 ≡ ε2,j+1) in eqs. (5) is in fact the electron
energy scaled according to the frequency ω2 of the second ﬁeld component.

We have, therefore, derived the two-dimensional map for the dynamics of the hydrogen atom
in the two-frequency ﬁeld similar to that for the monochromatic ﬁeld [4]-[6]. Taking into account
condition that phases of the ﬁeld components are all time interrelated we can easily generalize map

2

(5) to the multi-frequency ﬁelds as well; simply adding terms to the right-hand side of eqs. (5)
corresponding to the additional ﬁeld components.

The analysis of chaotic dynamics and ionization process described by map (5)-(6) is, therefore,
quite similar to that of the simple Kepler map [4]-[6]. So, we can easily analyze dependencies of
the dynamics on the parameters of the problem and obtain the ionization threshold ﬁeld strengths
as functions of the ﬁeld frequencies and ionization probabilities for the given ﬁeld strengths and
frequencies.

In such a way we have analyzed the threshold ionization ﬁeld F th

0 for diﬀerent values of the quantities F2,0 and s2,0 = ω2n3

0 dependence on the initial
relative frequency s0 = ωn3
0. As an
illustrative example, in ﬁg. 1 we show the results of the calculations for F2,0 = 0 (one-frequency
ionization) and F2,0 = 0.01, s2,0 = 0.986 (two-frequency ionization). The parameters of the later
case are close to that of the experiment in [7]. However, as far as the purpose of this paper is
derivation of the mapping equations for the multifrequency ﬁeld and analysis of the ionization
threshold ﬁeld dependence on the frequencies but not an analysis of the deﬁnite experiments we
calculate the ”absolute” threshold ﬁelds and ionization probabilities (for the inﬁnitely long action
the values do not depending on the
of the microwave ﬁeld with the constant amplitude), i.e.
concrete experimental conditions: increase and decrease of the ﬁeld amplitudes, ﬁnite time of the
ﬁelds action, cutoﬀ of the high principle quantum number and so no. Therefore, the parameters
in our illustrations are chosen according with the purpose of demonstration the most pronounced
[7], we choose F2,0 = 0.0169
resonance structure in the ﬁeld-atom interaction. So, if, as in ref.
instead of F2,0 = 0.01 we would observe in ﬁg. 2 a certain (with probability 1) ”absolute” ionization
probability in the relatively large interval of frequency s0 near the ﬁrst peak at s0 ≃ 0.8. It should
be noted that in paper [7] theoretical results obtained using generalized in some way mapping
equations of paper [4] are presented too. The used equations, however, have not been published.
Note also that authors of the paper [7] analyze only region of the ﬁrst peak near the main resonance.
Let us analyze the results of the calculations. So, two curves in ﬁg. 1 corresponding to the one-
frequency ionization and two-frequency ionization, (a) and (b) respectively, have similar minimum-
maximum structure. The main eﬀect of the second ﬁeld manifests itself in the shifting of the
minimum (maximum) positions to the lower relative frequencies. Besides, due to the inﬂuence of
the additional ﬁeld, the ﬁrst threshold ﬁeld F th
0 minimum (near s0 = 0.8) becomes much more
pronounced. The same occurs with the second minimum (near s0 = 1.7), too. The third minimum
(near s0 = 2.7) has been, however, almost lost after the supplement of the second ﬁeld. Note that
curve (b) only slightly diﬀers from the curve (c) calculated using correlated initial phases, ϑ0= ϑ2,0.
This means that the initial phase diﬀerence value is not very important for the qualitative threshold
ﬁeld F th
0 behavior. The similar eﬀect has been observed also in the experiment and calculations of
ref. [7].

By analogy with the paper [4] we can try to make some analytical evaluation of the threshold

ﬁeld F th

for the two-frequency case as well. Using the chaos criterion proposed in [9]

The dependences of the appropriate threshold ﬁeld F th

0 on s0 are shown in ﬁg. 1 as (d) and
(e) curves for one- and two-frequency ﬁeld, respectively. For the low initial relative frequency
(s0 < 1) eq.
(9) is a rough approximation. For relatively high frequencies (s0 > 1) it gives,
however, quite accurate threshold ﬁeld values. The analytical curves are monotonic and, therefore,
they represent only approximate threshold ﬁeld, F th
0 , behavior and do not reproduce minimum-
maximum sequences. For the more accurate evaluation of the threshold ﬁeld strength according
to the criterion (7), the increase of the electrons’s energy by the inﬂuence of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld should be taken into account [6]. If the scaled energy εj decreases in a result of the relatively
regular dynamics in the not suﬃciently strong microwave ﬁeld, then it is enough the lower ﬁeld
strength for transition to the chaotic dynamics.

There is one-to-one correspondence between the threshold ionization ﬁeld F th

0 and the ion-
ization probabilities Pion.. Both quantities are measurable. Often it is, however, easier to carry
out measurements of the ionization probabilities. Using map (5) we have calculated ionization
probabilities for one- and two-frequency ﬁelds. Curve (a) in ﬁg. 2 shows one-frequency ionization
probability as a function of the initial relative frequency s0 for F0 = 0.0298. Curves (b) and (c)
represent two-frequency ionization probabilities for F2,0 = 0.0298, s2,0 = 0.986 and F2,0 = 0.01,
s2,0 = 0.18, respectively, when initial phases of the ﬁeld components are random. The ﬁrst peak
(near s0 = 0.75) for the two-frequency ﬁeld with similar to case (b) parameters had been observed
in the experiment by Haﬀmans et al. [7]. We see that the second ﬁeld broadens and shifts ionization
probability peaks. Actually, one can realize their behavior from the threshold ﬁeld curves (ﬁg. 1),
too.

We have performed similar calculations for diﬀerent second initial relative frequency s2,0 values.
The results show that the ﬁrst ionization peak is very stable with respect to the relative frequency
s2,0 changes. This is not the case for the high frequency peaks – their positions and shapes are
quite sensitive to the frequency but not to the ﬁeld intensity variations. To illustrate this, in ﬁg.
3 we represent the ionization probability projection to the frequency s0 and s2,0 plane. White
color corresponds to the ionization peaks, dark indicates to the ionization valleys. The pattern is
almost symmetric with respect to the line s0 = s2,0 although the ﬁeld amplitudes F0 and F2,0 diﬀer
considerably. This means that minimum-maximum structure is weakly sensitive to ﬁeld strengths.
Finally some remarks should be made concerning validity conditions of the analysis based on
[10] have
the map (5). Earlier calculations and comparisons with experimental results [1]-[8],
shown that the one-dimensional hydrogen atom model reproduces quite reasonably the threshold
ﬁeld strength for the one-frequency ﬁeld in low relative frequency region (s0 ≤ 1 ). The quantum
analysis has suggested and experimental results have conﬁrmed that for the high relative frequency
of the monochromatic ﬁeld the classical chaotic diﬀusion is suppressed by quantum eﬀects [1]-[3],
[5]. It is, however, natural to expect that an additional microwave ﬁeld, like any other external
perturbation [11], [12], should result in delocalization of the states superposition and restoration
of the chaotic dynamics. Therefore, mapping equations of motion (5) for the multifrequency ﬁeld
should have larger region of validity than those for the monochromatic ﬁeld.

In summary, using the condition that the phases of the ﬁeld components are all the time
interrelated and in the derivation of the Kepler map we integrate within the period of the electron
intrinsic motion, we can easy generalize the Kepler map for the multifrequency ﬁeld. The dimension
of the map does not increase with increase of the number of the ﬁeld components and, therefore,
the analysis based on the maps of the dynamical chaos and ionization by the multicomponent ﬁeld

4

remains relatively simple. As an example, we have analyzed the map (5) for the two-frequency
ﬁeld and have obtained the threshold ionization ﬁeld and ionization probability curves (ﬁg. 1 and
2, respectively) for broad relative frequency range, 0.05 ≤ s0 ≤ 3. They show that position of
the ﬁrst peak (near the main resonance) in the ionization probability and corresponding threshold
ﬁeld minimum are weakly sensitive to the second ﬁeld strength and frequency values. In the high
frequency region peaks of the ionization probability are, on the contrary, frequency dependent.
From the other side, the minimum-maximum structure is weakly sensitive to ﬁeld strength values.

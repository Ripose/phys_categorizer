Abstract
My previous calculations of the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen are reviewed and compared
with other work. In addition, numerical results for muonic deuterium are presented.

Introduction
The energy levels of muonic atoms are very sensitive to eﬀects of quantum electrodynamics
(QED), nuclear structure, and recoil, since the muon is about 206 times heavier than the
electron [1]. A number of theoretical analyses of the Lamb shift (the 2p-2s transition)
in light muonic atoms have been published [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 15, 7, 9, 16], most recently in
view of a proposed measurement of the Lamb shift im muonic hydrogen [8]. The present
paper repeats the independent recalculation of some of the most important eﬀects [3] and
extends the numerical calculations to the case of muonic deuterium, including eﬀects that
were not considered previously [10]. Muonic deuterium is in many ways similar to muonic
hydrogen, but there are some diﬀerences. In addition to the diﬀerent mass the deuteron
has spin 1 and both magnetic and quadrupole moments.

In the numerical calculations the fundamental constants from CODATA 2002 ([11]):

α−1, ~c, mµ, me, mu = 137.0359991, 197.32697 MeV
·
0.5109989 MeV, 931.5050 MeV, respectively

fm, 105.658369 MeV,

Also, the following properties of the proton and deuteron were used: mp = 938.272 MeV/c2,

±

0.007 fm (other recent values are discussed below) and µp = 2.79285 µN.
Rp = 0.875
Also, md = 1875.613 MeV/c2, Rd = 2.139
0.003 fm and µd = 0.85744 µN = 0.307012 µp.
([11]) The deuteron has spin 1 and thus has both magnetic and quadrupole moments.
The quadrupole moment of the deuteron is taken to be Q = 0.2860(15) fm2 [12, 13, 14].

±

Vacuum Polarization
The most important QED eﬀect for muonic atoms is the virtual production and anni-
hilation of a single e+e− pair It has as a consequence an eﬀective interaction of order
αZα which is usually called the Uehling potential ([17, 18]. This interaction describes
the most important modiﬁcation of Coulomb’s law. Numerically it is so important that it
should not be treated using perturbation theory; instead the Uehling potential should be
added to the nuclear electrostatic potential before solving the Dirac equation. However,
a perturbative treatment is also useful in the case of very light atoms, such as hydrogen.

However, unlike some other authors, we prefer to use relativistic (Dirac) wave functions
to describe the muonic orbit. Since these contributions have been extensively discussed
in the literature [1, 2, 3, 4] (among others), there is no need to go into detail here. The
results, calculated as the expectation value of the Uehling potential using point-Coulomb
Dirac wave functions with reduced mass are, for muonic deuterium:

for muonic deterium, as far as I know.

An additional higher iteration including ﬁnite size and vacuum polarization is given in
ref. [4] (equations(66) and (67)) and ref. [2] (equations(264) and (268)). These amount to

The mixed muon-electron vacuum polarization correction ([21, 2]) is 0.00007 meV for

hydrogen and 0.00008 meV for deuterium.

The Wichmann-Kroll contribution was calculated using the parametrization for the
potential given in [1]. The result obtained for hydrogen is -0.00103 meV, consistent with
that given in [2]. For deuterium, the contribution is -0.00111 meV.

The equivalent potential for the virtual Delbr¨uck eﬀect was recomputed from the
Fourier transform given in [22] and [1]. The resulting potential was checked by reproducing
previously calculated results for the 2s-2p transition in muonic Helium, and the 3d-2p
0.00015) meV,
transitions in muonic Mg and Si. The result for hydrogen is +(0.00135
and for deuterium it is +(0.00147
0.00016) meV. As in the case of muonic helium,
this contribution very nearly cancels the Wichmann-Kroll contribution. The contribution
corresponding to three photons to the muon and one to the proton should be analogous
to the light by light contribution to the muon anomalous moment; to my knowledge,
the corresponding contribution to the muon form factor has never been calculated.
It
will be comparable to the other light by light contributions. This graph was included in
contributions to the muon’s anomalous magnetic moment; the contribution to the muon
form factor is one of the most signiﬁcant unknown corrections.

The sixth order vacuum polarization corrections to the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen
have been calculated by Kinoshita and Nio [23]. Their result for the 2p-2s transition (in
hydrogen) is

and 0.00804 meV for muonic deuterium.

However, I should remark that the contributions from ﬁgures 1 and 2 of Ref. [23] were
checked by direct integration. Although the results agreed perfectly for the case of hydro-
gen, there were small, but signiﬁcant discrepancies for the case of deuterium. (hydrogen:
Fig. 1 contributes 0.000396 meV and Fig. 2 contributes 0.002931 meV; deuterium: direct
integration gave 0.000472 meV and 0.003364 meV, respectively, while the work of ref.[23]
indicates values 0.000419 meV and 0.003906 meV, respectively). This indicates that, at
least for these two graphs, integration over momentum transfer involves more than a single
reduced mass factor.

The hadronic vacuum polarization contribution has been estimated by a number
It amounts to about 0.012 meV in hydrogen and 0.013 meV in
of authors [27, 28, 2].
deuterium. One point that should not be forgotten about the hadronic VP correction is
the fact that the sum rule or dispersion relation that everyone (including myself) used does
not take into account the fact that the proton (nucleus) can in principle interact strongly
with the hadrons in the virtual hadron loop. It is irrelevant for the anomalous magnetic
moment but probably not for muonic atoms. An estimation of this eﬀect appears to be
extremely diﬃcult, and could easily change the correction by up to 50%. Eides et al. [2]
point out that the graph related to hadronic vacuum polarization can also contriibute
to the measured value of the nuclear charge distribution (and polarizability). It is not
easy to determine where the contribution should be assigned. This may also be true for
the so-called ”proton self-energy” [5, 2], which involves some of the same graphs as are
present in the calculation of radiative corrections to electron scattering.

Finite nuclear size and nuclear polarization

Pachucki [5] has estimated a correction similar to the second term (proportional to

Relativistic Recoil
As is well-known, the center-of-mass motion can be separated exactly from the relative
motion only in the nonrelativistic limit. Relativistic corrections have been studied by
many authors, and will not be reviewed here. The relativistic recoil corrections summa-
rized in [1] include the eﬀect of ﬁnite nuclear size to leading order in mµ/mN properly.

Up to now this method has been used to treat recoil corrections to vacuum polarization
only in the context of extensive numerical calculations that include the Uehling potential
in the complete potential, as described in [1]. They can be included explicitly, as a
perturbation correction to point-Coulomb values. Recall that (to leading order in 1/mN ),

Details of the calculations for the case of vacuum polarization are given in Appendix 1
and in Ref.[3]. Corrections due to ﬁnite nuclear size can be included when a model for
the charge distribution is given. This done by Friar [24] (and conﬁrmed independently
for two diﬀerent model charge distributions); the contribution due to ﬁnite nuclear size to
the recoil correction for the binding energy of the 2s-level is -0.013 meV. The factor 1/mn
is replaced by 1/(mµ + mN ), also consistent with the calculations presented in [24].

Combining the expectation values given in Appendix 1 according to equations 2 and 3,
one ﬁnds a contribution to the 2p-2s transition of -0.00419 meV (hydrogen) and -0.00479 meV

(deuterium). To obtain the full relativistic and recoil corrections, one must add the
diﬀerence between the expectation values of the Uehling potential calculated with rel-
ativistic and nonrelativistic wave functions, giving a total correction of 0.0166 meV for
muonic hydrogen. This is in quite good agreement with the correction of .0169 meV
calculated by Veitia and Pachucki [33]. The treatment presented here has the advantage of
avoiding second order perturbation theory. For deuterium, one obtains a total correction
of 0.0179 meV.

The review by Eides et al. [2] gives a better version of the two photon recoil (Eq. 136)
than was available for the review by Borie and G. Rinker [1]. Evaluating this expression
for muonic hydrogen gives a contribution of -0.04497 meV to the 2p-2s transition in
hydrogen and -0.02656 meV in deuterium. Higher order radiative recoil corrections give
an additional contribution (in hydrogen) of -0.0096 meV [2]. However, some of the
contributions to the expressions given in [2] involve logarithms of the mass ratio mµ/mN .
Logarithms can only arise in integrations in the region from mµ to mN ; in this region
the eﬀect of the nuclear form factor should not be neglected. Pachucki [4] has estimated
a ﬁnite size correction to this of about 0.02 meV, which seems to be similar to the term
proportional to
i(2) given in Eq.(1) as calculated in the external ﬁeld approximation
by Friar [24]. This two-photon correction requires further investigation. In particular,
the parametrization of the form factors used in any calculation should reproduce the
correct proton radius. Also the relationship among the diﬀerent contributions needs to
be speciﬁed more clearly.

When evaluated for the 2p-states of muonic hydrogen, one ﬁnds a contribution to the
2p-2s transition energy of 0.0575 meV for the 2p1/2 state and -0.0287 meV for the 2p3/2
state in hydrogen ( 0.0168 meV for the 2p1/2 state and -0.0084 meV for the 2p3/2 state in
deuterium)

A ﬁnal point about recoil corrections is that in the case of light muonic atoms, the mass
ratio mµ/mN is considerably larger than the usual perturbation expansion parameter αZ.
Contributions of higher order in the mass ratio could be signiﬁcant.

Muon Lamb Shift
For the calculation of muon self-energy and vacuum polarization, the lowest order (one-
loop approximation) contribution is well-known, at least in perturbation theory. Including
also muon vacuum polarization (0.0168 meV) and an extra term of order (Zα)5 as given
in [2]: which contributes -0.00443 meV, one ﬁnds a contribution of -0.66788 meV for the
2p3/2 transition. For deuterium,

deuterium includes muonic vacuum polarization (0.01968 meV); the extra term of order

energies, computing the vacuum polarization contributions with Dirac wave functions,

Hyperﬁne structure

general potentials and arbitrary spins were given by Metzner and Pilkuhn [36]. Here a
version applicable to the case of muonic atoms (Z1 =

Hyperﬁne structure of the 2p state in muonic hydrogen
The hyperﬁne structure of muonic hydrogen is calculated in the same way as was done in
earlier work [7, 16], but with improved accuracy. Most of the formalism and results are
similar to those given by [4] and [35].

As has been known for a long time [7, 16, 4, 35], the states with total angular
momentum F = 1 are a superposition of the states with j = 1/2 and j = 3/2. Let

Hyperﬁne structure of the 2p-state in muonic deuterium
For the 2p state, the matrix elements of the magnetic hyperﬁne structure have been given
by Brodsky and Parsons [35]. For hydrogen they are the same as those calculated above.

As mentioned before, the Uehling potential has to be included in the potential V (r).
For states with ℓ > 0 in light atoms, this can be taken into account by multiplying βD
and ǫQ by (1+ ε2p) where ε2p is given by Eq.(9). With a numerical value of ε2p = 0.000391
for muonic deuterium, the value of ǫQ is increased to 0.43440 meV and the value of βD is
increased to β′

D=4.0922 meV.

Then for the 2p-level with j = j′ = 3/2 and F = 5/2, the energy shift is given by

δ + ǫQ/5 + (β′

aµ) = 9.373 meV.

For the 2p-levels with F = 1/2 and F = 3/2, the corresponding matrices have to be

diagonalized. The resulting numerical values for the eigenvalues are,
for F = 1/2, -1.3834 meV and 8.5974 meV; for F = 3/2 they are 0.6856 meV and
8.2410 meV.

The corrections due to QED eﬀects, nuclear size and recoil are analogous for muonic
deuterium.

The QED corrections have been discussed by Borie [3, 7, 16] (see also [38]), and are

given in Appendix 2.

The correction due to ﬁnite size and recoil have been given in [4] as -0.145 meV, while
a value of -0.152 meV is given in [42]. Ref. [4] also gives a correction as calculated by
Zemach ([40]) equal to -0.183 meV, but claims that this correction does not treat recoil
properly. The Zemach correction is equal to

of the 2s-state gives a total splitting of 22.7806 meV. Additional higher order corrections
calculated in Ref. [42] amount to a total of -0.0003 meV and are not included here.

It would be very desirable to understand the reasons for the discrepancy between
references [4] and [42] in the calculations of this eﬀect. Also, since the Zemach radius
seems to be sensitive to details of the electric and magnetic charge distributions [41],
evaluations performed with a dipole-type form factor may not be good enough. This
point requires further invesigation.

Summary of contributions and Conclusions
The most important contributions to the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen,
including
hyperﬁne structure, have been independently recalculated. A new calculation of some
terms that were omitted in the most recent literature, such as the virtual Delbr¨uck eﬀect
[22] and an alternative calculation of the relativistic recoil correction have been presented.

Numerically the results given in table 2 add up to a total correction of

(206.032(6) - 5.225
0.12 meV. (for the value of the
proton radius from [11]). As is well known, most of the uncertainty arises from the
uncertainty in the proton radius.

Since vacuum polarization is assumed to be a relatively small correction to the Coulomb
potential, it will be suﬃcient to approximate Q2(r) by αZ/r. After some algebra, one can
reduce the expectation values to single integrals:

When multiplied by

and of -0.00001 meV for the 2p-state. For muonic deuterium, the corresponding numbers are
-0.000176 meV and -0.000030 meV, respectively.

When multiplied by 1/(mµ + mN ) this results in a shift of 0.00489 meV for the 2s-state and
of 0.00017 meV for the 2p-state of muonic hydrogen. For muonic deuterium, the corresponding
numbers are 0.005543 meV and 0.000206 meV, respectively.

These expectation values also appear when vacuum polarization is included in the Breit

equation.

When multiplied by 1/(mµ + mN ) this results in a shift of 0.002475 meV for the 2s-state
and of 0.000238 meV for the 2p-state. For muonic deuterium, the corresponding numbers are
0.002753 meV and 0.000281 meV, respectively.

Combining these expectation values according to equations 2 and 3, one ﬁnds a contribution
to the 2p-2s transition of -0.00419 meV (hydrogen) and -0.00479 meV (deuterium). To obtain the
full relativistic and recoil corrections, one must add the diﬀerence between the expectation values
of the Uehling potential calculated with relativistic and nonrelativistic wave functions, giving a
total correction of 0.0166 meV for muonic hydrogen. This is in quite good agreement with the
correction of .0169 meV calculated by Veitia and Pachucki [33]. The treatment presented here
has the advantage of avoiding second order perturbation theory. For deuterium, one obtains a
total correction of 0.0179 meV.

The other contribution, as discussed by [38, 39] arises from the fact that the lower energy
hyperﬁne state, being more tightly bound, has a higher probability of being in a region where
vacuum polarization is large. This results in an additional energy shift of

Sternheim[39] denotes the two contributions by δM and δE, respectively. An alternative exres-

of the numerical integration was checked by reproducing these results. One can thus expect that
10−5, as in the case of normal hydrogen.
muonic vacuum polarization will contribute 3α2/4
This amounts to an energy shift of 0.0009 meV in muonic hydrogen and 0.0002 meV in muonic
deuterium. Contributions due to the weak interaction or hadronic vacuum polarization should
be even smaller. For muonic hydrogen, one obtains εV P 1=0.00211 and εV P 2=0.00325 for a
point nucleus. Including the eﬀect of the proton size (with GE(q) = GM (q) as a dipole form
factor) reduces these numbers to 0.00206 and 0.00321, respectively. For the case of muonic deu-
terium, the corresponding numbers are εV P 1=0.00218 (0.00207) and εV P 2=0.00337 (0.00326),
respectively. The contribution to the hyperﬁne splitting of the 2s-state of hydrogen is then
0.0470 meV+0.0733 meV=0.1203 meV (0.1212 meV if muonic vacuum polarization is included).
The combined Breit and vertex corrections reduce this value to 0.1207 meV. (0.1226 meV if the
proton form factors are not taken into account).

The contribution to the hyperﬁne structure from the two loop diagrams [19] can be calculated
by replacing U2(αZmrK) = (α/3π)F (φ) by U4(αZmrK) (as given in [1, 6]) in equations 13 and
10−5 and
10−5 and 2.46
14. The resulting contributions are 1.64

2.54
in muonic deuterium.

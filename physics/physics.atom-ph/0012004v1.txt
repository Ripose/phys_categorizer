The self-similar collapse of 3D and quasi-2D atom condensates with negative scattering length is
examined. 3D condensates are shown to blow up following the scenario of weak collapse: The in-
ner core of the condensate diverges with an almost zero particle number, while its tail distribution
spreads out to large distances with a constant density proﬁle. For this case, the 3-body recombina-
tion arrests the collapse, but it weakly dissipates the atoms. The conﬁning trap then reforms the
condensate at later times. In contrast, 2D condensates undergo a strong collapse: The atoms stay
mainly located at center and recombination sequentially absorbs a signiﬁcant amount of particles.

A few years ago, Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)
were discovered in trapped clouds of alkali atoms [1,2].
Among those, 7Li atoms are known to be characterized by
attractive interactions with a negative scattering length,
a0 < 0 [2]. This promotes a collapse-type instability,
which yields a singular increase in the BEC wavefunc-
tion. It occurs when the number of particles, ˜N , exceeds
a threshold value, ˜Nc ∼
, where l0 = (~/mω)1/2

l0/
|
is the amplitude of zero point oscillations in the conﬁn-
ing trap of frequency ω and m is the atom mass. BECs
formed in 7Li gas develop several sequences of collapse
[3]. From the initial cooling, the condensate is ﬁrst fed
by the thermal cloud of uncondensed atoms. Then, once
the number of atoms is above ˜Nc, the condensate sharply
concentrates with an increasing density. As the density
rises, inelastic collisions as 3-body molecular recombina-
tion increase, which arrests the collapse. The thermal
cloud is next believed to re-ﬁll in the condensate, that
reaches ˜N > ˜Nc and then collapses again. The cycle
of collapses repeats many times until the gas comes to
equilibrium. This scenario is supported by numerical in-
tegrations of the Gross-Pitaevskii (G.-P.) equation [4,5]:

recombinations with m = 4. The normalized number of

Nc = 14.45 for being stable. In physical
quires Neq ≤

for stability: ˜Nc = 1252 atoms, for the 7Li parameters

Numerical simulations [4] of Eq.

(1) revealed that,
near the collapse moment, the condensate expands with
a density proﬁle exhibiting a low-amplitude, almost ﬂat
plateau,
const, from r > 1. This plateau-like
behavior was again numerically found in [5], where the
free collapse was described as a ”black hole”. Follow-
ing this scenario, the increase in the BEC density is fu-
eled by particles drawn from throughout the outer region
(r > 1), while the density outside form imploding ripples.
However, it was suggested that the asymptotic plateau in
2 may not be constant, but instead diverges in time.

Thus, the singular dynamics of 3D collapsing BECs is
still questionable and a self-consistent model for BEC
collapse is actually missing. Describing the structure of
such collapses is of utmost importance, in order to under-
stand the inﬂuence of recombination, trap conﬁnement
and re-feeding over several collapse events.

In this letter, we examine the self-similar nature of col-
lapsing BECs. For 3D isotropic condensates the number
of particles is analytically shown to vanish near center
and, outside, a constant plateau in the density proﬁle,
r2
2, is actually formed. From this dynamics, 3-body
|
recombination arrests the collapse by removing a limited
number of particles from the condensate. We also brieﬂy
investigate 2D condensates. As justiﬁed in [7], quasi-
2D BECs can be produced from 3D atom clouds with
a density frozen on a Gaussian shape
0 , when
the particles are tightly conﬁned along the longitudinal
axis. In what follows, 2D and 3D condensates are con-
sidered as isotropic, radially-symmetric objects, since the
self-compression induced by the collapse dynamics make
them have comparable sizes along each direction.

We now discuss the dissipative/gain regime, that in-
volves collisional
losses and feeding by the thermal
cloud. The inﬂuence of these two eﬀects on the con-
densate particle number is described by the last two
terms in the continuity equation (7). By introduc-
ing the self-similar shape (5), these terms are found to

Collisions begin to be active when a(t) decreases so

bution saturates the blow-up induced by the cubic non-
linearity, for m > 2. By means of this relation, the num-
ber of particles ∆Nloss lost from the condensate during
one collapse event is then yielded by that in the core re-
gion, Ncore. Inelastic collisions are thus able to stop the
collapse, but they cannot remove a lot of particles, the
major part of N
Ntail starting to be transferred to
large distances via the weak collapse. Explicitly, we ﬁnd
by using Eq. (5) expressed with arbitrary m and D:

ploy φ0 = 1.39 and ξT = 3.1. Thus, in physical units, the
number of atoms removed during a single blow-up event
is ∆ ˜Nloss = 44 atoms. This loss of particles agrees with
recent numerical observations [13]. Here, approximately
300 particles were lost from a condensate of initial num-
ber N0 = 1260 atoms, in a sequence of 5-6 individual
η1/2−m.
blow-up events with peak amplitudes
As discovered by Vlasov et al. [14] and conﬁrmed in [11],
an untrapped, 3D collapsing ﬁeld is damped within a
very short time window, in which the ﬁeld experiences
η2/m−2, as long
secondary blow-up events of duration
as nonlinear dissipation remains active. These arise while
most of the atoms form a broad disribution surrounding
the collapsing core and are directed outwards. Collapse
is not arrested abruptly, but it is distributed through a
series of individual spikes. This ”distributed collapse”
[14] resembles the ”intermittent implosions” numerically
detected in [13]. Note that these intermittent implosions,
which overlap as one collapse sequence over a trap period,
may not be resolved in real experiments. Their integrated
eﬀect should only yield a smooth decrease in ˜N .

Once collapse is limited,

it is necessary to under-
stand the mechanism underlying reformation and peri-
odic resurgences of spiky amplitudes in the condensate
[3]. We emphasize that after the collapse stage most
particles lie in the outer domain 1
r < rmax, where
the atoms feel both the trap curvature and re-feeding
by the thermal cloud. The latter re-injects particles

lier instants for which refeeding is negligible. To this
aim, we deﬁne the centroid of the expanded structure by

close to an equilibrium, that is described by the ground

As shown in Ref. [6] (see also [16]), ground states are
stable with dNeq/dµ < 0 for rather broad condensates
(0.72 < µ < 3). They are unstable and collapse with
dNeq/dµ > 0 for rather narrow condensates (µ < 0.72).

player for making the resulting BEC bifurcate to a stable

collapse develops. This scenario meets the deﬁnition of
the so-called strong collapse, which contrasts with the
3D weak collapse that promotes a leak of atoms to large
distances. The relative variations in the particle num-
ber due to collisional losses are governed by the estimate
m+2d~ξ. As a(t) decreases,

does not explicitly vary with the coeﬃcient η, as already
indicated by Eq. (10), and it slightly decreases with m,
in agreement with the numerical observations of Ref. [11].
Collapse is thus arrested by 3-body recombinations that

In conclusion, we have shown that BECs with attrac-
tive interactions collapse with a mean radius contract-
ing like √tc −
t at leading order, where tc denotes the
collapse moment. In 3D, the collapse is weak: the am-
plitude of the wavefunction blows up at center, while
particles are expelled outwards with a constant density
proﬁle r2
const. Recombination losses limit the
collapse, but they only damp a few percents of the atoms
at each blow-up. Several blow-up events develop within
one collapse sequence. The condensate is then reconﬁned
by the trap and can further undergo more collapse cycles,
as long as a stable state has not been reached. Quasi-2D
condensates are subject to a strong collapse, in the sense
that the number of particles remains mostly conﬁned at
center. In this case, recombination removes a signiﬁcant
fraction (up to 0.5) of particles per collapse event.

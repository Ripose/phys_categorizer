Theory of Laser Catalysis with Pulses

Abstract

The possibility of accelerating molecular reactions by lasers has attracted con-
siderable theoretical and experimental interest. A particular example of laser-
modiﬁed reaction dynamics is laser catalysis, a process in which the tunneling
through a potential barrier is enhanced by transient excitation to a bound elec-
tronic state. We have performed detailed calculations of pulsed laser catalysis
on one- and two-dimensional potentials, as a function of the reactants’ collision
energy and the laser’s central frequency. In agreement with previous CW re-
sults, the reactive lineshapes are Fano-type curves, resulting from interference
between nonradiative tunneling and the optically assisted pathway. In contrast
to the CW process, the power requirements of pulsed laser catalysis are well
within the reach of commonly used pulsed laser sources, making an experimen-
tal realization possible. The laser catalysis scenario is shown to be equivalent
in the “dressed” state picture, to resonant tunneling through a double-barrier
potential, admitting perfect transmission when the incident energy matches a
quasibound state of the well within the barriers. Possible applications for atom
optics, solid-state devices, and scanning tunneling microscopy, are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The enhancement and suppression of dissociation processes [1–8] and chemical reactions
[1,9–18] by lasers have been the subject of numerous theoretical and experimental studies.
Many of the proposed schemes are based on the modiﬁcation of molecular potentials by the
radiation ﬁeld. The new (“dressed”) potentials may open pathways for reaction, which were
previously closed, thereby completely altering the radiation-free course of events. The details
of these light-induced potentials depend on the laser parameters (frequency, intensity, and
pulse-shape), which may therefore be used to control the reaction yield.

One approach for the acceleration of exchange reactions uses the interaction of IR radiation
ﬁelds with the permanent [9,10] or ﬁeld-induced [11] dipole moment of an A+BC system, which
varies as the system crosses the reactive region. Thus, reaction barriers are traversed on the
ground electronic potential, even when the reactants are IR inactive and the laser frequency is
far from resonance [9]. However, due to the rather weak dipole moments involved (e.g. in the
order of 0.05 a.u. for the H+H2 system [10,11]), the interaction of the reacting system with the
radiation becomes signiﬁcant only when the laser power is in the order of TW/cm2. At these
intensities, nonresonant strong ﬁeld processes such as multiphoton dissociation and even more
prominently, multiphoton ionization take over, thereby drastically reducing the reaction yield.
In order to overcome this diﬃculty, it was was proposed to employ the resonant excitation
of electronic transitions by optical or UV radiation, thereby allowing reactants to cross the
ground state reaction barrier [12–18]. The laser in this case couples to electronic transition
dipoles which are orders of magnitude stronger than the dipole moment of the ground state.
Earlier implementations involved the free-free coupling of scattering states on the ground and
excited electronic potentials [12–14]. Power requirements for these schemes are still high be-
cause the transition dipole moments are greatly reduced due to the rapidly oscillating nuclear
wavefunctions. Moreover, once a transition to the excited electronic potential takes place, the
reaction would inevitably proceed on that surface, the net result being the excitation of an
electronic transition and the absorption of a photon.

“Laser catalysis” [15–18] was devised as a reﬁnement of the free-free electronic excitation
schemes. When, as depicted in Fig. 1, the excited electronic surface has a minimum located
above the ground state potential barrier (i.e. there exists a stable electronically excited trimer
ABC∗), exchange reactions taking place on the ground electronic surface may be enhanced or
suppressed by transient excitation to a bound molecular state. The stronger dipole moments
for the free-bound transition ensure that power requirements are relaxed. Moreover, because
the excited state is bound, the excited reagents are trapped in the transition state region and
shuttle freely from the reactants’ rearrangement channel to the products channel.

Seminal proposals for laser catalysis involved a CW source of optical/UV radiation, coupling
the ground and excited electronic potentials [15,16]. Detailed calculations for the CW laser
catalysis of the H+H2 reaction [16] indicated that the power requirement for the process is in
the order of 100 MW/cm2. This was both good and bad news. Good, because the above power
is suﬃciently low to avoid any parasitic strong ﬁeld eﬀects and bad, because unfortunately, at
the current state of laser technology, such intense CW sources are not in supply. Nevertheless,
pulsed lasers could easily accommodate the above power demand. It was therefore clear that in
order to facilitate an experimental implementation of the technique, schemes for pulsed laser

2

catalysis should be devised.

The dressed state methodology of the CW laser catalysis studies [15,16] can not account for
the use of pulses. A new theoretical machinery was required in order to check whether the CW
results would hold for the pulsed process. Therefore we have developed a time-dependent theory
of pulsed laser catalysis [17,18], which builds on a previous formalism for photodissociation
[19] and photoassociation [20].
In this article, we review the detailed calculations of pulsed
laser catalysis on one- [17] and two-dimensional [18] electronic potential surfaces. Our results
accurately reproduce all the features of CW laser catalysis and may well open the way to an
experimental demonstration of the process.

II. LASER CATALYSIS WITH PULSES

The laser catalysis scheme is outlined in Fig. 1. Consider an A + BC → AB + C exchange
reaction, described by a smooth potential barrier along the reaction coordinate of the ground
electronic surface. The collisions of A atoms with BC molecules are described by the outgoing
scattering states Ψ+
E,R (Fig. 1, solid arrows), corresponding to a ﬂux originating in the reactants’
(A + BC) rearrangement channel and impinging on the barrier from the right. We assume that
the collision energy is not suﬃcient to classically overcome the activation potential. Therefore,
only a fraction of all collisions taking place without radiative assistance, given by the quantum
tunneling probability through the barrier, would be reactive. The eﬀect of a laser pulse of
frequency ω, assumed to be in near-resonance with the transition to an intermediate ground
state Ψ0, is to open another pathway into the products’ (AB+C) rearrangement channel. Thus,
E,R to states Ψ+
population is transferred from states Ψ+
E,L (Fig. 1, dashed arrows), with the
ﬁnal aim that the entire wavefunction would be localized in the products’ channel (catalysis)
or in the reactants’ channel (suppression) at the end of the process.

Snapshots of the nonradiative reactive scattering process on a potential surface resembling
the ground electronic potential of the collinear H+H2 reaction [21] are shown in Fig. 2. The
simulation is performed at an incident energy of 8.8 kcal/mol, compared with an activation
energy of approximately 9.8 kcal/mol. As can be seen, the reaction probability at this energy
is negligible. The wavepacket arrives at the barrier region, only to be reﬂected back into the
A + BC rearrangement channel, with less than 1% reaction yield. However, when the laser
pulse is turned on, we observe a complete population transfer to the AB + C products’ channel,
as depicted in Fig. 3. The resulting radiative reaction yield is greater than 99%. Note that
throughout the process there is hardly any loss of ﬂux to the excited state Ψ0. This is important
because even a transient accumulation of population in the excited state may expose the process
to spontaneous emission losses, and thereby compromise the scheme’s eﬃciency.

A wavepacket approaching the barrier of Fig. 1 in the reactants’ channel may either non-
radiatively tunnel through it, or radiatively “hop” above it. The existence of two possible
pathways across the activation barrier suggests that interesting interference eﬀects may be
observed between them. We note that a similar situation causes the Fano resonances [22] of
autoionization, predissociation and laser induced continuum structure (LICS). In Fig. 4 we plot
the reaction probability of a one-dimensional laser catalysis process [17], as a function of the
pulse carrier frequency, at three pulse intensities. The nonradiative reaction probability, cor-
responding to a far oﬀ-resonant laser frequency, is about 9%. The obtained reactive lineshape

3

has an asymmetric Fano-type proﬁle, i.e. the reaction is enhanced for a blue-detuned pulse
and suppressed for a red-detuned pulse. Moreover, there exists a positive detuning value, for
which the transmission coeﬃcient is nearly unity, and a negative detuning value, for which the
transmission coeﬃcient is nearly zero. This interference phenomenon stems from the existence
of two sources for the population in the products’ channel: the nonradiatively transmitted
wavepacket of Ψ+
E,R states and a second, radiatively transmitted packet of Ψ+
E,L states. These
two packets interfere either constructively or destructively, depending on the sign of the laser
Increasing the
detuning, thereby leading to yield enhancement or suppression, respectively.
intensity of the catalizing laser has the eﬀect of strengthening the radiative path with respect
to the intensity-independent nonradiative process, thereby radiatively broadening the reactive
line.

Great insight into the laser catalysis mechanism is gained by adopting the “(photon) dressed
states” picture, in which we consider the optically-induced molecular potential surfaces. These
are obtained by diagonalization of the 2 × 2 dressed potential matrix, comprising the (diagonal)
dressed potentials and the (oﬀ-diagonal) ﬁeld-dipole coupling term. The resulting two ﬁeld-
matter eigenvalues are plotted in Fig. 5. Due to the existence of two avoided crossing points
of the diabatic potential curves, the ground ﬁeld-matter eigenvalue has the shape of a double-
barrier potential and the ﬁrst excited eigenvalue has a double-well proﬁle. The separation
between these curves gets larger as the coupling ﬁeld strength is increased. Thus, particles
approaching the transition state region are resonantly scattered by a double-barrier potential.
When the incident energy is near a quasibound state of the well between the barriers, perfect
transmission is admitted, regardless of the potential details [23]. Thus, the resonances observed
in the laser catalysis lineshapes originate from the same mechanism that produces the resonant
modes of semiconductor devices [23] and Fabry-P´erot interferometers [24]. The same mechanism
was recently used to devise a continuum version [25] of the schemes for coherent enhancement
and destruction of tunneling by an intense oﬀ-resonant driving ﬁeld [26].

III. FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Our studies of one-dimensional [17] and two-dimensional [18] laser catalysis indicate that
experimental veriﬁcation of the predicted eﬀects may be carried out using commercially avail-
able pulsed laser sources. Nevertheless, further work is required in order to go beyond collinear
reactive scattering on symmetric surfaces. A much desired feature of our formalism in this
respect, is that it neatly separates the laser parameters (i.e.
frequency, detuning, and pulse-
duration) from the material part of the problem (i.e. the electronic transition dipole moments,
determined by the overlap of molecular wavefunctions). Thus, all we need for a full, three-
dimensional calculation of any particular laser catalysis scenario, are the molecular transition
dipole moments for that reaction. Such transition matrix elements were calculated for the 3D
H+H2 reaction [16], making it an obvious next step. Reliable electronic potential surfaces exist
also for the asymmetric F+H2 reaction [27] and for several MXH systems (M and X being an
alkali atom and a halogen atom, respectively) [15,28]. Laser catalysis of these reactions is par-
ticularly attractive from an experimental point of view, because the reactants and the products
are easily distinguishable. In selecting a suitable candidate, one should ascertain that: (a) The
potential barrier is suﬃciently high to prohibit thermal activation, (b) There exists an excited

4

potential well, (c) The radiative transitions are strongly allowed, and (d) There are pulsed laser
sources able to provide the required wavelength. We expect the ﬁrst experiments to be carried
out at low collision energies, where the nonradiative transmission amplitudes are vanishingly
small, and consequently, the nonradiative background is negligible.

While the original formulation of laser catalysis involves the acceleration of atom-diatom
exchange reactions, possible implementation need not be limited to this ﬁeld. The strong fre-
quency dependence of the total transmission probability, manifested in the narrow resonance
lines, may be the basis for the construction of eﬀective optical gates. The same eﬀect could be
used for the production of narrow velocity ﬁlters, including an atomic Fabry-Perot interferome-
ter [29], based on laser-assisted tunneling through optically induced potentials. Another attrac-
tive application is the laser control of tunneling through individual atoms in low-temperature
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) junctions [30], which may lead to a new form of single
atom spectroscopy and open the way for the construction of atomic scale electro-optical devices.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, our results verify the viability of pulsed laser catalysis. All the qualitative
features of the CW process [15,16] which was deemed impractical due to its high power demand,
were reproduced. The power demands of the pulsed process are easily satisﬁed by commer-
cially available sources, ﬁnally making an experimental demonstration possible. Our formalism
facilitates a relatively easy treatment of diﬀerent exchange reactions. The detailed calculation
of any particular reaction requires only the relevant transition dipole moments, which need be
calculated only once for all pulse parameters. Possible implementations in solid-state devices,
atom optics, and scanning tunneling microscopy, go beyond the acceleration and suppression
of chemical reactions.

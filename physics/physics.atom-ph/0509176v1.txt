We report detailed spectroscopic measurements of the X(0)

(v = 5)
transition in PbO. Using a Stark-modulated laser absorption technique, we have measured the
hyperﬁne constant of 207PbO in the B(1) state, as well as the B(1)(v = 5) rotational constant,
X − B isotope shifts, etc. The hyperﬁne constant of the B(1) state is of interest as a benchmark
for calculations of PbO electronic structure, related to experiments to search for the electric dipole
moment of the electron.

Spectroscopy of the PbO molecule has become of in-
terest since it is a good candidate for use in searches for
a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the elec-
tron, de. EDMs are interesting because a non-zero value
for an EDM of any fundamental particle would violate
parity and time-reversal symmetries. Standard model
predictions for EDMs are well below any proposed ex-
perimental sensitivities. However, most extensions of the
standard model predict dramatically enhanced EDMs.

A promising approach towards improving the limits on
de involves heavy polar diatomic molecules in a conﬁgu-
ration with an unpaired electron spin. In such systems,
the eﬀective electric ﬁeld Wd seen by the unpaired elec-
tron can be many orders of magnitude larger than exter-
nal ﬁelds attainable in the laboratory [1, 2]. An electron
EDM can be detected by spin polarizing an electron along
this internal ﬁeld and searching for the characteristic lin-
ear Stark shift ∆E = −deWd. Interpreting experimental
limits on ∆E measured in a molecule in terms of de re-
quires a value for Wd. This can be obtained using semi-
empirical wavefunctions for the state of interest [1], or
from ab initio calculations [2]. Spectroscopic properties
sensitive to the electron spin density at the nucleus such
as hyperﬁne structure (hfs) can constrain the parameters
in semi-empirical evaluations of Wd, or test the predic-
tions of ab initio calculations.

An experiment is underway in our lab using the
a(1)
state of PbO, that may improve the current
limit |de| < 1.6 × 10−27 e cm [3] by several orders of
magnitude [4]. Such an improvement would probe large
regions of the parameter space of many standard model
extensions. Stimulated by this work, a measurement of
the hyperﬁne constant of the a(1) state was recently re-
state of 207PbO
ported [5]. The hfs of the B(1)
is also of interest, since it can be used to further check
and/or reﬁne the electronic structure calculations used to
calculate the value of Wd in the a(1) state. In addition,
knowledge of the B(1) hfs can be used for estimating Wd

for the B(1) state, which also may be a viable candi-
date for an EDM search [6]. This motivates this eﬀort to
determine the hfs of the B(1) state of PbO.

The measurements were made by observing the ab-
sorption of laser light by PbO vapor in a cell as the laser
wavelength was tuned. The cell contains PbO of natural
isotopic abundance; it is constructed from a 5.7 cm cube
of alumina, with 5.1 cm diameter through holes bored
perpendicular to, and centered on, each face. The top
and bottom holes of the resulting cubical frame struc-
ture are capped with alumina plates. Thin YAG win-
dows are bonded on the remaining four holes using gold
foil as an intermediate layer. The cell is heated to 700◦C
by the radiation from resistively heated thin foils of tan-
talum supported on a quartz framework surrounding the
cell. This results in a PbO number density n ≈ 4 × 1013
cm−3 in the cell. The laser used in the measurements
was an external cavity diode system based on a standard
design [7]. Our system used a Nichia NLHV500C violet
diode laser and 3600 grooves/mm diﬀraction grating in
a Littrow conﬁguration. The laser provided <
∼1 mW of
power around 406.5 nm which passed through the YAG
windows into the cell.

To enable sensitive lock-in detection of the absorption,
we employed a Stark modulation technique [8]. As ex-
plained below, this method enhances signals from low J
levels where the hfs is largest, which are otherwise diﬃ-
cult to isolate within the spectrally congested region near
the bandhead. Here we brieﬂy discuss the basic features
of the Stark-modulated signals, as relevant to our exper-
iment.

The Stark eﬀect in the X(0) → B(1) transition is dom-
inated by shifts due to mixing between the closely-spaced
Ω-doublet levels in the B(1) state. The doublet mem-
bers, e and f , share a common value of total (electronic
+ rotational) angular momentum J but are of opposite
parity. The spacing between the doublet levels is given
by ∆Ω(J) = qJ(J + 1), where q ≪ Bv=5, the rotational
constant for the B(v = 5) state. [By convention, q is pos-
itive if the e level, with parity P = (−1)J , is at higher
energy.] In the absence of an electric ﬁeld E, selection
rules for the electric-dipole X → B transition ensure that
the laser light is absorbed only in the transition to one
of the doublet levels. In the presence of E, the e and f

, (2)

where µB(1) is the dipole moment of the B state, and
F = J + I is the total angular momentum. In the limit
of large E and small J, ∆ν ∝ E and the doublet levels
are completely mixed. In this limit, the laser is absorbed
with equal strength by both eigenstates of the mixed dou-
blet, and the repulsion of the doublet levels results in a
characteristic broadening of the absorption spectral line
(see Fig. 1). For a laser tuned to one of the unperturbed
doublet levels, by modulating E, maxima in absorption
will occur twice per period at the minima of E. The Ω-
doublet mixing leads to small shifts in the line centers, as
does the slight residual Stark mixing with nearby rota-
tional levels of opposite parity. Both of these small shifts
(≤ 50 MHz) are accounted for in the analysis.

In our measurements, an electric ﬁeld E was produced
using two parallel 3.8 cm diameter gold foil electrodes
spaced 0.6 cm apart in the cell. The laser light was lin-
early polarized parallel to E and traversed the vapor cell

between the electrodes. A reference signal at ω = 2π ×99
kHz was ampliﬁed to produce a voltage V = V0 cos(ωt),
where V0 ≈ 800 V, across the electrodes. The transmit-
ted light was detected with a photodiode and ampliﬁed.
Part of the laser beam was diverted for a wavelength
measurement (using a Burleigh WA-1500 Wavemeter),
and the laser power reﬂected from the cell was monitored
with a second ”reference” photodiode.

The transmitted signals were sampled at 1 MHz with
a 12 bit ADC and recorded for 4 s. The amplitude of the
signal at the 2nd harmonic of the reference was extracted
from the digitized data. Then the laser frequency was ad-
vanced roughly 150 MHz by simultaneous adjustment of
the grating angle and diode current, and a new absorp-
tion measurement was taken. This cycle was repeated
until a mode-hop occurred, yielding scans covering 15-30
GHz.

The scans showed absorption features correspond-
ing to 208PbO, 207PbO, and 206PbO molecules making
P -, Q-, and R-branch transitions from the electronic
(v′′ = 0, J ′′) to the excited state
ground state X(0)
∼ 1 for J ′′ = 0 − 6. An
B(1)
example is shown in Fig. 2. Before analyzing the data,
the absorption amplitudes were corrected for the varia-
tion in laser power with frequency during a scan. We
expect residual variations in amplitude over the scan of
∼ 5%, based on observed ﬂuctuations in the ratio be-
tween transmitted and reﬂected power (presumably due
to interference eﬀects in the cell windows). The statisti-
cal uncertainty in each measurement was estimated from
the ﬂuctuations of the second harmonic out of phase with
the signal, and was typically a few times greater than
the shot noise in the photodiode signal. The largest sig-
nal was observed from the Q1 208PbO line, with a peak
S/N ≥75, corresponding to ≈ 4 ppm absorption. These
scans were ﬁt to extract the hfs constant and coeﬃcients
in the Dunham expansion, as described below.

Hyperﬁne structure in the B(1) state of 207Pb0 arises
from the interaction Hhfs = Je · A · I = AkJeZIZ +
A⊥ (JeX IX + JeY IY ), where A is the hyperﬁne tensor,
I = 1/2 is the nuclear spin of 207Pb, Je is the electronic
angular momentum, and the coordinate axes are deﬁned
in the body-ﬁxed frame, with ˆZ along the internuclear
axis ˆn. For levels with low J values in an Ω = 1 elec-
tronic state, the hfs is dominated by the term in Hhfs
proportional to Ak. The terms containing JX,Y induce
oﬀ-diagonal mixing with states with Ω 6= 1, which are
far in energy for this Hund’s case (c) molecular state.
We can thus write the energy shift due to hfs, correct to
second order in Hhfs ≈ AkJeZIZ , as

Initial assignments of each line were possible using es-
timates of the B(1) state energies by extrapolation from
the data of Ref. [9], and taking into account the known
natural abundances of each Pb isotope. The line splitting
due to hfs in 207PbO is clearly visible in two transitions,
corresponding to the Q1 and Q2 lines, in Fig.2. The un-
perturbed line positions of these hfs-split lines could be
located initially by extrapolating from 207PbO lines with
higher values of J, which exhibit much smaller hfs split-
ting. The sign of Ak is found to be positive by visual
inspection of Fig. 2, using the following observations:
the largest peak, which is closest to the unperturbed line
center, must arise from the F = J +1/2 state (see Eqn.5);
and in addition, if Ak > 0 (< 0), then this line should
lie higher (lower) in energy than the unperturbed line
center.

Once the lines were assigned, each scan was analyzed
with a multiparameter ﬁt in which the modulated ab-
sorption lines were approximated as as sum over second
derivatives of a gaussian, with a separate gaussian for
each value of mJ in the excited state. With the iso-
topic abundances ﬁxed, several ﬁt parameters were used
to characterize the height and the width of the various
transitions; these included the ratio of P :Q and R:Q tran-
sition strengths, the value of µB(1), the Doppler width,
and a measure of the electric ﬁeld inhomogeneity. To ex-
tract line positions, the energy EZ,A(v, J) of electronic
state Z (Z = X, B) with vibrational and rotational quan-
tum numbers v and J, respectively, for the APbO isotopic
species was written as

EZ,A(v, J) =GZ,A

v J (J + 1) − DZ,A

v + BZ,A
+ EX,A(v = 0, J = 0).

The energies of the X state sublevels were taken from the
precise data of Ref. [9]. The B state values were deter-
mined by ﬁtting, with separate values of the rotational
constants used for the Ω-doublet levels with e and f char-
acter. For 207PbO, the hfs constant Ak was included as
an additional ﬁt parameter.

As described above, determination of Ak was the pri-
mary goal of our work. Fitting the data set yielded
Ak = 5.01(7) GHz, where the dominant uncertainty is

The shifts between the values of GB,A

v=5 for the diﬀerent
isotopes arise from changes in both the rovibrational and
electronic energies. In order to separate these eﬀects, it is
necessary to evaluate the absolute ro-vibrational energies
of the B(1)(v = 5) and the X(0)(v = 0) states. We
accomplish this using a Dunham expansion :

the data of Ref. [9] on the three lowest vibrational levels

determination of GB,208
v=5 . Although inclusion
of our data shifts the values of individual Dunham coeﬃ-
cients noticeably (as compared to their values using only
[9]), the resulting change in the ro-
the data from Ref.
vibronic part of the isotope shifts is small: <
∼ 100 MHz,
comparable to the uncertainty in our determination of
individual line positions. Due to our limited range in J,
we have negligible sensitivity to isotopic diﬀerences in the
rotational constants.

(cid:11)

known diﬀerence in mean-square charge radii between
the diﬀerent Pb isotopes [15] to separate our measured
values for the electronic shift into ﬁeld- and mass-shift
contributions. We ﬁnd V B − V X = 1.0(7) × 10−5 fm−2,
and ∆B − ∆X = 8.5(3.1) × 10−6. The normal part of
the mass shift (due to the change in the electron reduced
mass) is negligibly small; hence the observed shift is a
speciﬁc mass shift, due to electron correlations. This shift
is unusually large, although similar shifts are known to
occur in complex atoms [14].

In summary, we have measured some detailed spectro-
scopic parameters of the X(0)(v = 0) → B(1)(v = 5)
transition of PbO. The measured value of the B(1) state
hfs provides an important data point for checking calcu-
lations of the eﬀective electric ﬁeld acting on an electron
EDM in excited states of PbO.

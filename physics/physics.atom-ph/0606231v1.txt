Abstract

We report the development of a ﬁber-based, tunable optical cavity with open access. The cavity is of

the Fabry-Perot type and is formed with miniature spherical mirrors positioned on the end of single- or

multi-mode optical ﬁbers by a transfer technique which involves lifting a high-quality mirror from a smooth

convex substrate, either a ball lens or micro-lens. The cavities typically have a ﬁnesse of ∼ 1, 000 and
a mode volume of 600 µm3. We demonstrate the detection of small ensembles of cold Rb atoms guided

through such a cavity on an atom chip.

An optical cavity ampliﬁes the interaction between light and matter by recirculation of the

light at a resonant frequency. This feature is exploited in a number of ﬁelds, notably lasers and

optical sensors. Furthermore, it is crucial to experiments and possible technologies based on

exploiting the quantum mechanical properties of individual atoms and photons. In this ﬁeld of

cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED), the crucial features of the cavity are a small mode waist

and/or mode volume Vm, and a high ﬁnesse F = ∆ν/δν (where ∆ν is the free spectral range and

δν the linewidth of the cavity), equivalently a high Q factor Q = ν/δν [1]. The “gold standard”

for CQED cavities is still being set by macroscopic Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities with superpolished,

concave mirrors. These mirrors have relatively large radii of curvature (R = 20 cm is typical)
and achieve record ﬁnesse values of F > 2 × 106 [2]. However, there are situations where

cavities of this type cannot be used, and a number of alternative cavity designs have been proposed

(see for example [3]). A notable example calling for an alternative cavity design is single-atom

detection for quantum information processing on atom chips [4, 5, 6, 7] where the macroscopic

cavity is incompatible with the microscopic chip. Another example concerns the insertion of

quantum objects such as quantum dots and molecules into cavities where the need for cryogenic

temperatures makes a macroscopic design problematic. While microscopic cavities are being

actively developed, existing designs typically lack an easy way of tuning the cavity into resonance.

An optical ﬁber-based resonator offers an attractive way forward [7, 8]. Here we describe

a ﬁber-coupled Fabry-Perot (FFP) cavity that employs concave dielectric mirror coatings with

small radius of curvature, realized on the ﬁber tip. A stable cavity is constructed as shown in

Fig. 1(a),(b), either from one such ﬁber tip facing a planar mirror (“1FFP”), or from two closely

spaced ﬁber tips placed face-to-face (“2FFP”). Thus, unlike the design of [8], the cavity can easily

be used in transmission, and does not require a concave depression to be fabricated on the substrate.

We demonstrate how such cavities can be easily fabricated using commercially available lift-off

coatings. Tunability is achieved by attaching one of the ﬁbers to a piezoelectric actuator. Because

of the small ﬁber diameter (125 µm), very short cavities (< 10λ/2) can be realized even with

radii of curvature R ≤ 1 mm, still leaving a sufﬁciently large gap to introduce cold atoms. We

achieve stable cavity modes with a ﬁnesse of ∼ 1, 000 in the near infrared. The mode volume is
Vm = 600 µm3, to be compared to Vm = 1680 µm3 for the smallest-volume macroscopic FP cavity
that has been used with atoms [9]. In terms of CQED parameters, the small mode volume results

in an exceptionally high coherent atom-photon coupling rate, g0/2π = 180 MHz (calculated for

the Rb D2 line at λ = 780 nm) . Therefore, in spite of the comparatively high damping rate,

2

κ/2π = 2.65 GHz which results from the moderate ﬁnesse and short length, the cavity reaches a
single-atom cooperativity parameter greater than unity, C = g2

0/2κγ = 2.1 where γ/2π = 3 MHz

is the atomic linewidth, signaling the onset of quantum effects such as enhanced spontaneous

emission into the cavity mode and a signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of cavity transmission by the presence

of a single atom. The potential of this approach is demonstrated here with an experiment using

a 2FFP cavity to detect an extremely weak ﬂux of cold atoms magnetically guided on an atom

chip. We present this technology not only as an important stepping stone towards on-chip single

atom detection but also for cavity experiments with quantum dots, semiconductor nanocrystals

and molecules, and for telecoms devices.

The concave mirrors are fabricated from a convex template and a lift-off step. For large radii of

curvature, ≥ 500 µm, the template is a commercial ball lens whereas for smaller radii, 100 − 500

µm, the template is a silica micro-lens specially fabricated for these experiments. The micro-lenses

are etched into a planar silica substrate following the melting and re-solidiﬁcation of a photoresist

mesa. Surface tension provides an extremely smooth photoresist surface such that the roughness

in the micro-lens is determined only by the subsequent dry-etching step and can be as small as ∼ 1

nm. The template is coated [14] in one run with a release layer and silica-titania dielectric Bragg

stack, with a stopband centered either at 780 nm or 850 nm and nominal reﬂectivity of 99.7%.

We then position a cleaved single mode ﬁber immediately above the center of the coated lens by

maximizing the back reﬂection of a laser beam coupled into the ﬁber. The ﬁber is then glued in

place with an UV-curing epoxy, after which the application of a small force is sufﬁcient to detach

the mirror from the original substrate. The result is a ﬁber functionalized with a highly reﬂecting

concave mirror, as shown in Fig. 1(c). A complete 2FFP cavity is shown in Fig. 1(d).

In order to characterize the modes of a 1FFP cavity, we measured the white light transmission

spectrum for several values of the cavity length L. We ﬁnd that stable cavity modes with high F

can be established with little attention to the alignment, unlike the planar-planar cavity geometry

which is extremely sensitive to alignment and mechanical noise. The results are shown in Fig. 2(a).

As expected for a FP cavity, for each L there is a series of longitudinal modes, until at the smallest

L there is just one longitudinal mode in the stopband. Each longitudinal mode consists of a

series of ﬁnely spaced modes, corresponding to the different transverse modes. This lifting of the

degeneracy of the transverse modes allows a spectroscopic determination of the mirror curvature.

Fig. 2(b) plots the wavelength shift of the higher order modes relative to the fundamental as a

function of L showing how the spacing increases as L decreases. The solid curves in Fig. 2 are

FIG. 1: (a) and (b) Concept of the miniature cavity. The basic building block is an optical ﬁber functional-

ized with a concave dielectric mirror. Two such ﬁbers, brought sufﬁciently close to each other, result in a

stable Fabry-Perot cavity which can be interrogated remotely, either in transmission or in reﬂection, through

the two ﬁbers (“2FFP” conﬁguration, (a)). Alternatively, a single ﬁber can be brought close to a reﬂecting

planar surface (“1FFP” conﬁguration, (b)). The 1FFP conﬁguration is suitable for use with nanofabricated

structures such as quantum dots. (c) A single-mode optical ﬁber, total diameter 125 µm processed with a

concave mirror. The mirror has radius 1000 µm with a stopband centered at 780 nm. (d) A miniature cavity,

the results from Gaussian optics for a stable, planar-spherical cavity [10], ∆λ = (λ2/2πL)∆(m +
n) cos−1 p1 − L/R where m, n are the lateral mode indices. At large (small) L, the results
are best described with a radius of about 200 (230) µm. This compares well with the radius of

the micro-lens template, 250 µm. The slight dependence on L is likely to result from a slight

“softening” of the mirror away from its center: as L increases, the beam waist at the curved mirror

increases, probing more of the curved mirror.

The limited resolution of the spectrometer prohibits a proper measurement of the ﬁnesse, and

only a lower limit can be deduced (F > 500 for small L). We have therefore measured the

cavity transmission as a function of L using grating-stabilized diode lasers (Fig. 3). To determine

the ﬁnesse, two lasers were simultaneously coupled into the cavity. The ﬁrst laser is locked to
a sub-Doppler line in the 87Rb D2 spectrum at λ = 780.27 nm, the second is tuned several κ

away to 780.6 nm using a wavemeter. The known wavelength difference of the two lasers allows

us to calibrate the length scan with a better precision than the length-voltage characteristics of

the piezo. Additionally, we simultaneously recorded the transmission of a third diode laser at

1/2∆(1/λ) where ∆(1/λ) is the change in wave number from one fundamental longitudinal mode to the

next. The modes are labeled with the sum of the two lateral mode indices, m and n. The widths of

the transmission peaks are limited by the spectrometer and therefore do not reﬂect the true ﬁnesse. (b)

828.25 nm in order to determine unambiguously the absolute cavity length. As a typical result, we

have measured a ﬁnesse F = 1, 050 for a 2FFP cavity with L = 27 µm and R = 1, 000 µm using

a single-mode ﬁber on the input side and a multimode ﬁber on the output side. This is in good
agreement with independent measurements of the mirror transmission, T = 8 × 10−4, and loss,
ℓ = 2.4 × 10−3 [15]. From these values, the expected ﬁnesse is F = π/(T + ℓ) = 980 ± 40. This

indicates that the ﬁnesse of the FFP is as high as the coatings allow. The 1/e beam waist in the
cavity in Fig. 3 is w = 5.4 µm, implying a cavity mode volume Vm ∼ 600 µm3 and C = 2.1 for
Rb.

We have used the 2FFP cavity as a very sensitive detector for magnetically guided atoms on an

atom chip. The experimental setup is similar to our previous experiments [11, 12], but contains

FIG. 3: Transmission of a 2FFP cavity versus cavity length. A piezo is used to vary the cavity length. The

absolute length is determined by using up to three lasers as described in the text. The mirrors have radius

1,000 µm with a stopband centered at 780 nm. The cavity has an effective cavity length of 27 µm with a

ﬁnesse of 1050; equivalently, free spectral range 5500 GHz and mode width (FWHM) 5.29 GHz. The inset

shows the line shape of the fundamental (0,0) mode.

an FFP subassembly. Each ﬁber is glued onto a piezoelectric actuator, and the piezos are glued

onto a ceramic bridge while monitoring the cavity transmission signal. The mirror spacing on

axis is 27 µm as in Fig. 3, leading to a gap between mirror edges of ∼ 15 µm; the ﬁnesse is 260.

The subassembly is glued onto the chip with a 230 µm separation between the cavity axis and the
chip surface (Fig. 4 (a)). A magnetically trapped cloud of 87Rb atoms at a temperature of 70 µK is

produced in an initial trap and then released into a very elongated Ioffe-Pritchard potential, created

using a “Z wire” [4]. This potential guides the atoms through the center of the resonator mode.

The cavity mode is excited by a very weak resonant probe laser, both the laser and the mode being

tuned to atomic resonance. The transmitted signal is detected with a photon counter. Fig. 4 (b)

shows sample transmission signals with and without atoms. We have independently determined

the atomic density and temperature before entry into the cavity using absorption imaging and

time-of-ﬂight analysis. Integrating the initial density over the cavity mode yields an upper-bound

estimate Nmax for the number of atoms in the cavity mode, Nmax ∼ 50. It is clear however that

the true number of atoms contributing to the signal is much lower because the transverse size of

the atom cloud is signiﬁcantly larger than the gap between the mirrors, so that a large part of the

atoms is lost upon entering the cavity, and does not contribute to the signal.

Our current cavities aim for high cooperativity.

It is interesting however to consider what

improvements would be necessary to enter the strong coupling regime of CQED, i.e., g0 > κ, γ

[1]. To obtain strong coupling, it is preferable to increase the mirror distance L provided L ≪ R:
for a given R, κ drops as κ ∝ L−1, whereas g0 only decreases as g0 ∝ L−3/4. L = 200 µm

is a realistic value where alignment should still be manageable, and where the spot size on the

mirrors remains much smaller than the mirror diameter, so that clipping loss can still be neglected.

At this L, the parameters of the 2FFP cavity with R = 1 mm would become g0/2π = 42 MHz

and κ/2π = 360 MHz. Thus, the ﬁnesse needs to be improved by roughly a factor of 10, to

F = 10, 000, in order to reach the strong coupling regime. Presently, the ﬁnesse of our cavities

is limited by the quality of the multilayer coatings. However, the transfer coating technology

continues to improve as suggested by the fact that the transfer coatings used in [8], fabricated after

the ones used here, resulted in a measured ﬁnesse F = 6, 000. Speculating that the coating quality

can be improved further, the remaining issue is the surface roughness of the template for the liftoff

7

process. For a ball lens from the batch used in our current cavities, an AFM measurement gave an
rms roughness of σ = 1.7 nm. Following a standard estimate for scattering loss, S = (4πσ/λ)2,

this roughness must be improved to σ ≤ 0.7 nm which is achievable both with superpolishing and

with micro-lens fabrication.

We conclude by noting that, even without any further improvement, the FFP cavities described

here should enable single-atom detectivity with good signal-to-noise ratio [6, 7]. Unlike dispersive

detection without a resonator [13], this technique will ultimately allow detection with less than one

spontaneous emission per atom on average, enabling preparation of single-atom states.

The conditions of formation of spontaneous polarization phase transition to the superra-
diance regime in the inverted system of nonrelativistic electrons on equidistant Landau levels
in rareﬁed magnetized plasma are found. The opportunity of realization of such conditions in
the lower Jupiter magnetosphere is shown. The eﬀect of cyclotron superradiance on Landau
levels gives a key to interpretation of a nature of the super-power radioemission of the system
Jupiter-Io.

The phenomenon of superradiance (SR) was considered ﬁrst time in known Dicke work
[1] on the example of two-level model. Now rather signiﬁcant literature (see for example,
reviews [2,3,4]) is devoted for it, but as it is marked by many authors, the theme is farly from
being exhausted, many interesting and physically important questions and situations remain
not investigated. One of them is the question of an opportunity of SR realization in systems
with equidistant levels at presence of inversion. The system of fast electrons in a homogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld for which the cross movement (rotation) energy spectrum is described by known
Landau levels is the most easily realizable and important of such systems [5]

The question of an opportunity and conditions of SR formation in such systems, besides general
physical interest, represents also the great astrophysical interest because the inversion at Landau
levels is easily achieved in rareﬁed magnetized plasma of active space objects at occurrence
of bunches of accelerated electrons, if their initial speeds are directed under some corner to a
magnetic ﬁeld and so besides longitudinal energy E

For example, in the Jupiter magnetosphere [6,7] observable super-power sporadic nonthermal
decameter radiation of Jupiter-Io system with brightness temperature up to 10 15
1017 K can
serve the evidence of possible realization of such situation and generation of SR.

they have also a signiﬁcant cross energy E

In the present work the question of an opportunity and conditions of SR formation in the
inverted system of electrons on high Landau levels (1) with n
1 and a possibility of realization
of these conditions in the lower Jupiter magnetosphere are investigated. As it is known, for
generation of the induced coherent radiation in systems like masers the equidistancy of levels
is an obstacle because of speciﬁc competition of radiation and absorption processes in this
case.
In a case of SR we deal not with induced, but with spontaneous radiation and here,
as we shall see, equidistancy appears of advantage. This is, ﬁrst, because the SR regime is
usually realized in open ﬁnite systems without mirrors when radiation leaves active volume of
generation quickly enough, practically having no time to get in absorption regime [3]. Second,
in this case all inverted electrons occupy, as a rule, not one level, but some signiﬁcant interval
of high levels
1),and because of equidistancy, all of them radiate the same
mode on frequency (2), and also, as we shall see, in the same rate, not depending from initial
energy.

The phenomenon of SR arises when in ”coherence domains”, with sizes R0, smaller then a
wave length λ, all N0 radiating dipoles gradually, during radiation, are aligned in one direction
λ), so that in
due to the dipole - dipole interaction between them in a ”near zone” (R0 ≪
result the total dipole of the domain −→D appears in N0 times larger then an elementary dipole
−→d . Therefore the intensity of collective dipole radiation becomes proportional to N 2
0 - as against
of N0 in the case of radiation of noncorrelated dipoles. This is described in section 2.

The transition in such correlated, polarized state is similar to phase transition in magnetics
or ferroelectrics, and for its description it is convenient to use a Weiss method of mean self-
consistent ﬁeld [8]. This theory is developing in section 3. Let’s note, that the considered phase
transition is nonequilibrium one and it has all features of the self-organizing phenomenon in

2

dissipative systems. In section 4 the key role of SR eﬀect for interpretation of observable power
of Jupiter-Io system decameter radiation is discussed.

In this connection we can proceed to (quasi-) classical description of such states and transitions

where in braces the cartesian components of the vector −→r

Being inverted in the beginning on high levels, electrons start to fall downwards step by
step on the stair (1), radiating quants with frequency (2). Diﬀerential (on corners) and integral
intensities of dipole radiation of one electron in a classical limit are described by known formulas

It is possible to divide the total volume V , occupied by N inverted electrons, on subvolumes
Vcoh, or ”coherence areas”, which sizes R0 are smaller in comparison with radiated wave length
λ, but are greater in comparison with radiuses of Larmor orbits (3), describing the sizes of
elementary dipoles

Thus a big enough number of N0 radiating dipoles will be in volume Vcoh

The multiplier (1 + n2
z)/2 reﬂects the anisotropy properties of dipole radiation of nonrelativistic
electrons. The second member in square brackets describes the correlation eﬀects connected
with mutual aligning of dipoles. If correlations are not present, i.e. contributions of all cos(αi −
αj) are mutually compensated and in the sum give zero, then in (18) the ﬁrst member works
only, that corresponds to the total radiation of N0 independent elementary dipoles. It is easy
to specify the situations when the second member in (18) completely compensates the ﬁrst so,
that any dipole radiation do not arise. These are, certainly, the situations when total dipole
moment −→D becomes equal to zero. Let‘s take for example a case when N0/2 dipoles were built
strictly in one direction, and the others N0/2 in opposite. Then correlations of pairs in each of
1)/2 such pairs in one
these groups are constructive and give cos(
group and as much in another, i.e. their common positive contribution is equal to N0(N0/2
1).

Correlations between dipole pairs of diﬀerent groups are destructive and give cosπ =

that the contribution of such pairs is, obviously, equal to
2(N0/2)2 = 0, as
contributions with the ﬁrst member in (18), we receive: N0 + N0(N0/2
well as it should be from physical point of view, because we have taken a case with −→D = 0.

This is just SR [1].

Radiation time of such correlated dipoles radiating coherently will decrease in N0 times in

comparison with time (7)

τcoh = τ /N0.

Really it is possible to expect only partial positive correlation of phases, i.e. partial aligning

of all dipoles, when the average over ensemble value of cosine is positive

We proceed now to consideration of the mechanism of spontaneous aligning of the dipoles

giving rise to SR regime.

3. Polarization phase transition in ”coherence domains”.

To solve the problem of the phase transition we apply here the Weiss method of self-
consistent mean ﬁeld [8] approved in the theory of spontaneous magnetization. Let‘s consider
the potential energy of trial dipole −→d 0(−→r 0, t) with the electric ﬁeld −→E (−→r 0, t), created at a
point −→r 0 by the other (N0 −

1) dipoles

.

All dipoles rotate under the law (4) and radiate, and their electric ﬁeld is not static but also
rotates with frequency ω. So the use of expression (24) for a ﬁeld −→E (t) demands the explanation.
The matter is that the conditions (11), determining the ”coherence volume” , mean that various
λ), where the main
dipoles of the domain are relative each other in a so-called near zone (R0 ≪
member in decomposition of retarded potentials and ﬁelds on degrees of small parameters
(rL/R0) and (rL/λ) appears just expression (24) (see to this occasion, for example, [9]).

Averaging (23) over the rotation period, we notice, that points −→r 0 and −→r j characterize
not instant positions of rotating electrons, but positions of the motionless rotation centers and
consequently do not depend on time. Having substituted (24) in (23) and having averaged over
the period, we receive

It is possible to replace the sum (25) approximately by the integral over coordinates rj in limits
of ” coherence volume ” Vcoh with an obvious measure nedVj, representing a mean number of
(d−→r j) in a vicinity of a point −→r j. But before writing
dipoles in the element of volume dVj ≡

Aligning of dipoles over the directions is energetically favourable because of increasing thus of
the negative contribution to potential energy < U >. Therefore, the energetically preferable
correlations will occur only in that part of ”coherence volume” where the area of integration
over relative coordinates satisﬁes the condition

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

i.e.
in the area like a ﬂattened out circular cylinder. We shall name this part of coherence
area as a ”coherence domain” or otherwise as a ”domain of self-polarization”. In the similar
next domain the direction of an average vector of polarization should be close to opposite to

minimize the positive energy of electric ﬁeld of polarization in the system as a whole. It is known
that by virtue of the similar reason the macroscopical volumes of magnetics and ferroelectrics
are broken into domains also. Adjacent domains are separeted by transition regions (”domain
walls”) within the limits of which the turn of polarization vector occur.

We return now to an estimation of integral in (27) with constraint (28). It is convenient to

calculate it in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, z, ϕ), in which

Now we consider a question about the minimal and maximal limits (ρ1, ρ2) over relative
y2)2 in a plane between two dipoles in the coherence domain.
(x1 −
coordinate ρ =
We remind, that the characteristic sizes of initial ” coherence volume ” were determined by
λ. The inequality (29) means that in relative coordinates ” the
conditions (11): rL ≪
coherence domain ” has the form of ﬂattened out circular cylinder with radius 2R0. Hence, the
maximal value of ρ is ρ2 = 2R0, the minimal value of ρ1 should be taken about double Larmor
2rL, because at smaller distances between dipoles centers the interaction between
radius ρ1 ∼
pair of electrons does not carry dipole character any more and it is impossible to use dipole
formulas. It must be noted that at conditions considered here, Debay screening radius occur
a bit smaller than rL. Thus, we can write ln(ρ2/ρ1)
ln(R0/rL). As the ratio R0/rL enters
under a sign of logarithm, the result is poorly sensitive to exact value of this ratio. Thus, taking
λ, we can substitute R0 here by the quantity of the order
into account also a condition R0 ≪
of λ/10. We can write in a result

4. Problem of power of Jupiter decameter radiation.

For an illustration of criterion (58) working we consider the values of parameters included
in (58) which are characteristic for lower magnetosphere of the active system Jupiter - Io at the
base of so-called ”Io ﬂux tube” where, under observations, one of sources of powerful decameter
radiation is located [7]. Characteristic values of parameters here are those: H

This rather modest requirement to the density of inverted fast electrons at the base of Io ﬂux
tube which can be easily satisﬁed, so there are all bases to believe that sporadic super-power
decameter radiation of the Jupiter - Io system can be related with SR generation.

Under basic version [ 6,7 ] accepted now, the streams of energetic electrons appear near
Jupiter magnetic poles due to their acceleration up to several kev in Io ionosphere and the
further movement to the Jupiter along magnetic ﬁeld lines of dipole ﬁelds. Acceleration of
electrons is provided by inducing in Io body and ionosphere of electromotive force
400 kv,
due to Io movement across Jupiter magnetic ﬁeld. Magnetic ﬁeld lines of Io ﬂux tube converge
to Jupiter magnetic poles. So, an initial area of acceleration of electrons in Io ionosphere

Electrons moving along the Io ﬂux tube in the beginning have density below critical value
and so radiate rather poorly. But near Jupiter magnetic poles the density of electrons reachs the
supercritical values and they pass to SR regime. Thus, in this region the intensity of collective

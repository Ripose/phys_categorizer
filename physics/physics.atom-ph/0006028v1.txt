Abstract. We present a theoretical proﬁle of the Lyman β line of atomic hydrogen perturbed by collisions
with neutral hydrogen atoms and protons. We use a general uniﬁed theory in which the electric dipole
moment varies during a collision. A collision-induced satellite appears on Lyman β, correlated to the
B′′ ¯B 1Σ+
g asymptotically forbidden transition of H2. As a consequence, the appearance of the line
wing between Lyman α and Lyman β is shown to be sensitive to the relative abundance of hydrogen ions
and neutral atoms, and thereby to provide a temperature diagnostic for stellar atmospheres and laboratory
plasmas.

1 Introduction

In Allard et al. 1999 [1] we derived a classical path expres-
sion for a pressure-broadened atomic spectral line shape
that allows for a radiative electric dipole transition mo-
ment which depends on the position of the perturbers.
This factor is not included in the more usual approx-
imation of Anderson & Talman 1956 [2] and Baranger
1958 [3,4]. We used this theory to study the inﬂuence of
the variation of the dipole moment on the satellites present
in the far wing proﬁles of the Lyman series lines of atomic
hydrogen seen in stars and in laboratory plasmas.

Satellite features at 1600 ˚A and 1405 ˚A in the Lyman α
wing associated with free-free quasi-molecular transitions
of H2 and H+
2 have been observed in ultraviolet (UV) spec-
tra of certain stars obtained with the International Ultra-
violet Explorer (IUE) and the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) [5,6,7,8]. The stars which show Lyman α satellites
are DA white dwarfs, old Horizontal Branch stars of spec-
tral type A, and the λ Bootis stars. The last two have

the distinctive property of poor metal content, that is,
low abundances of elements other than H and He. Satel-
lites also have been observed in the laboratory spectra of
laser-produced hydrogen plasmas [9,10].

Satellite features in hydrogen lines are not limited to
Lyman α, which is the only Lyman-series line accessible
to IUE as well as HST. Observations with HUT (Hopkins
Ultraviolet Telescope) and with ORFEUS (Orbiting Re-
trievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrograph) of
Lyman β of DA white dwarfs with Teﬀ close to 20000 K
have revealed a line shape very diﬀerent from the expected
simple Stark broadening, with line satellites near 1078 and
1060 ˚A [11,12]. The satellites in the red wing of Lyman β
are in the 905 to 1187 ˚A spectral region covered by the
Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) launched
in June 1999. Furthermore, Lyman β proﬁles are also the
subject of an ongoing study of the far ultraviolet spectrum
of dense hydrogen plasmas. The strengths of these satel-
lite features and indeed the entire shape of wings in the
Lyman series are very sensitive to the degree of ionization
in the stellar atmosphere and laboratory plasmas, because

that determines the relative importance of broadening by
ion and neutral collisions.

In a previous work [13] we presented theoretical pro-
ﬁles of Lyman β perturbed solely by protons. The calcula-
tions were based on the accurate theoretical H+
2 molecular
potentials of Madsen and Peek [14] to describe the inter-
action between radiator and perturber, and dipole transi-
tion moments of Ramaker and Peek [15]. The line proﬁles
were included as a source of opacity in model atmospheres
for hot white dwarfs, and the predicted spectra compared
very well with the observed ORFEUS spectra [12].

The very recent ab initio calculations of Drira 1999 [16]
of electronic transition moments for excited states of the
H2 molecule and very accurate molecular potentials of
Schmelcher [17,18] now allow us to compute Lyman β pro-
ﬁles simultaneously perturbed by neutral atomic hydrogen
and by protons. The aim of our paper is to point out a
collision-induced satellite correlated to the B′′ ¯B 1Σ+
u −
X 1Σ+
g asymptotically forbidden transition of H2. We show
that the shape of the wing in the region between Lyman β
and Lyman α is particularly sensitive to the relative abun-
dance of the neutral and ion perturbers responsible for the
broadening of the lines.

2 Theory

The classical path theory for the shape of pressure-broadened
atomic spectral lines which takes into account the varia-
tion of the electric dipole moment during a collision is
only brieﬂy outlined here. The theory has been described
in detail in [1]. Our approach is based on the quantum
theory of spectral line shapes of Baranger [3,4] developed
in an adiabatic representation to include the degeneracy
of atomic levels [19,20,21].

2.1 General expression for the spectrum in an
adiabatic representation

The spectrum I(ω) can be written as the Fourier trans-
form of the dipole autocorrelation function Φ(s),

I(ω) =

Φ(s)e−iωsds .

(1)

the set of electronic coordinates (position and spin) plus
spin coordinates of the nuclei, while R denotes the set
of position coordinates of the nuclei. We assume that the
radiating atom is immersed in a perturber bath in thermal
equilibrium. The density matrix ρ is

ρ ≡

e−βH
Tr e−βH ,

where β is the inverse temperature (1/kT ).

We use the notation

h( )i ≡ Tr ρ( ) ,

(5)

(6)

where Tr denotes the trace operation.

The adiabatic or Born-Oppenheimer representation com-

prises expanding states of the gas in terms of electronic
states χe(x; R) corresponding to frozen nuclear conﬁgura-
tions. In the Schr¨odinger equation

(Telec + V (x, R))χe(x; R) = Helec(R)χe(x; R)

= Ee(R)χe(x; R) .

(7)
(8)

R appears as a parameter, and the eigenenergies Ee(R)
play the role of potential energies for the nuclei. Any total
wave function Ψ (x, R) can be expanded as

Ψ (x, R) = Xe

ψe(R) χe(x; R) .

(9)

As the nuclei get far from each other, which we denote
by R → ∞ , the electronic energies Ee(R) tend to asymp-
totic values E∞
e which are sums of individual atomic ener-
gies. Since atomic states are usually degenerate, there are
in general several diﬀerent energy surfaces which tend to
a same asymptotic energy as R → ∞ . We will consider
speciﬁcally a single radiating atom, the radiator, immersed
in a gas of optically inactive atoms, the perturbers. For a
transition α = (i, f ) from initial state i to ﬁnal state f ,
we have R-dependent frequencies

ωe′e(R) ≡ (Ee′ (R) − Ee(R))/¯h ,

e ∈ εi , e′ ∈ εf(10)

which tend to the isolated radiator frequency

ωα ≡ ωf i ≡ (E∞

(11)

as the perturbers get suﬃciently far from the radiator:

Let us introduce projectors Pe which select the eth adia-
batic component of any Ψ (x, R) according to [20]

ment of the radiator in the Heisenberg representation (we
use bold notation for operators) [22]. H is the total Hamil-
tonian

H = Tnucl + Telec + V (x, R),

(4)

where Tnucl and Telec are sums of nuclear and electronic
kinetic energy operators respectively, and V (x, R) is the
interaction between particles. Here x denotes collectively

PeΨ (x, R) = ψe(R)χe(x; R) .

We write the dipole moment as a sum over transitions

The sum P(α)

e,e′ is over all pairs (e, e′) such that ωe′,e(R) → ωα

as R → ∞. Thus Dα connects all pairs of adiabatic states
whose electronic energy diﬀerences become equal to ωα as
R → ∞. In the absence of perturbers, Dα would be the
component of D responsible for the radiative transitions
of frequency ωα. We note that the projection operators
account for the weighting factors discussed in Ref. [21].

Introducing the expansion Eq. (14) for D into the ex-

pression Eq. (3) for Φ(s), we obtain

The time dependence of Φα(s) is determined by Dα(s),
the part of the dipole moment which, in the absence of
perturbers, oscillates at the frequency ωα. Let us now de-
note

dα(s) ≡ Dα(s)e−iωαs

(25)

wherein the free evolution e−iωαs is factored out.

For an isolated line, such as Lyman α, we have shown
(Allard et al. [1]) that the normalized line shape Jα(∆ω),
in the uncorrelated perturbers approximation, is given by

Jα(∆ω) = FT[engα(s)]

(26)

In the classical path approximation, where we assume that
the perturber follows a rectilinear trajectory at a single

mean velocity ¯v, we get from [21,1] that gα(s) can be writ-
ten as

gα(s) =

The separation of the radiator and perturber is

where we denoted

dee′ (r) = h χe(r)|d|χe′ (r)i .

(28)

(30)

(31)

In the above, we neglected the inﬂuence of the potentials
Ve(r) and Ve′ (r) on the perturber trajectories, which re-
main straight lines. Although we should drop the Boltz-
mann factor e−βVe(r) for consistency with our straight tra-
jectory approximation, by keeping it we improve the result
in the wings. Note that over regions where Ve(r) < 0, the
factor e−βVe(r) accounts for bound states of the radiator-
perturber pair, but in a classical approximation wherein
the discrete bound states are replaced by a continuum;
thus any band structure is smeared out.

3 Theoretical analysis

3.1 Formation of line satellites

Close collisions between a radiating atom and a perturber
are responsible for transient quasi-molecules which may
lead to the appearance of satellite features in the wing of
an atomic line proﬁle.

When the diﬀerence ∆V (R) between the upper and
lower interatomic potentials for a given transition goes
through an extremum, a relatively wider range of inter-
atomic distances contribute to the same spectral frequency,
resulting in an enhancement, or satellite, in the line wing.
The uniﬁed theory [2,22] predicts that there will be satel-
lites centered periodically at frequencies corresponding to
the extrema of the diﬀerence potential between the upper
and lower states, ∆ω = k∆Vext, (k = 1, 2, . . .) [23,24,25].
Here ∆ω is the frequency diﬀerence between the center
of the unperturbed spectral line and the satellite feature,
measured for convenience in the same units as the poten-
tial energy diﬀerence. This series of satellites is due to
many-body interactions.

3.2 Diatomic potentials

The adiabatic interaction of the neutral hydrogen atom
with a proton or another hydrogen atom is described by
potential energies Ve(R) for each electronic state of the
H+
2 or H2 molecule (R denotes the internuclear distance
between the radiator and the perturber). For H-H+ col-
lisions we have used the potentials of H+
2 calculated by
Madsen and Peek [14]. For H-H collisions we have used
the potentials of H2 calculated by Schmelcher [17].

In Fig. 1 we have plotted the H2 potential diﬀerences
∆V (R) for the singlet states which contribute to Lyman β.
We have used letters here to label the states. B3 is the well
known B′′ ¯B 1Σ+
u state. At small internuclear separation,
R, the state correlates with the B′′ 1Σ+
u state, the third
1Σ+
u state of the Rydberg series. At larger internuclear
separation the state has an ionic character until R= 19 ˚A
where the potential energy curve of the H+ + H− (1s)2
state crosses the H(n = 1) + H(n = 3) energy levels, be-
cause of an avoid crossing ¯B looses its ionic character.
Dabrowski and Herzberg [26] predicted the existence of
the ¯B, the ﬁrst calculations were done by Kolos [27,28].
More recent calculations are reported in [18,29].

We use B4 and B5 respectively to label the 4 1Σ+
u and
u states, and V and D to label the 3 1Πu and 2 1Πu

5 1Σ+
states.

Each diﬀerence potential exhibits at least one extremum
which, in principle, leads to a corresponding satellite fea-
ture in the wing of Lyman β (see Sect. 3.1). The present
approach now allows us also to take into account the
asymptotically forbidden transitions of quasi-molecular hy-
drogen which dissociate into (1s,3s) and (1s,3d) atoms.
The satellite amplitude depends on the value of the dipole
moment through the region of the potential extremum re-
sponsible of the satellite and on the position of this ex-
tremum. We have shown [1,13,30] that a large enhance-
ment in the amplitude of a spectral line satellite occurs
whenever the dipole moment increases through the region
of internuclear distance where the satellite is formed.

The potential diﬀerences of the B3-X and B4-X tran-
sitions exhibit double wells. The maximum at 3.0 ˚A of the
B3-X potential and minimum of the B4-X potential are
due to an avoided-crossing.

The most signiﬁcant characteristic of Fig. 1 is the exis-
tence of the deep outer well at 6 ˚A of the B3-X potential.
The ionic interaction decays slowly making the potential
energy diﬀerence very broad compared to the very steep
wells of the other transitions. This is very important as
the position of the extremum and the functional depen-
dence of the potential diﬀerence on internuclear separation
determine the amplitude and shape of the satellites [21].

3.3 Electronic transition dipole moments

moments for H+
2 and H2, calculated as a function of inter-
nuclear distance respectively by Ramaker and Peek [15]
and by Drira [16], were used for the transitions contribut-
ing to Lyman α and Lyman β. For Lyman β, the four com-
ponents which correspond to 1s−3p atomic transitions are
dipole allowed [16]: the two singlet B4-X and D-X tran-
sitions, and the two triplet 4 3Σ+
u and 2 3Πg-3Σ+
u
transitions .

g -3Σ+

If electronic states i and f of an isolated radiator are
not connected by the dipole moment operator, that is
if Dif (R → ∞) = 0, allowed radiative transitions can-
not occur between these two states. This happens for the
other transitions which correspond to 1s − 3s and 1s − 3d
atomic transitions. Although these transitions should not
contribute to the unperturbed line proﬁle, Dif (R) may
diﬀer from zero when a perturber passes close to the radi-
ator. In this instance radiative transitions are induced by
collisions, but not at the unperturbed line frequency.

It often arises that an extremum in the potential dif-
ference occurs when the ﬁnal (or initial) potential en-
ergy curve exhibits an avoided crossing, the corresponding
wavefunctions exchange their characteristics and the ra-
diative dipole transition moment varies dramatically with
R. This is exactly what happens for the B3-X transition.
To point out the importance of variation of dipole moment
on the formation of a collision-induced (CI) satellite, we
have displayed in Fig. 2 D(R) together with the corre-
sponding ∆V (R) for the B3 − X asymptotically forbidden
transition. The dipole transition is extremely small for the
isolated radiating atom ( R → ∞ ) but it goes through a
maximum at the value of R where the avoid-crossing oc-
curs and remains quite important at the internuclear dis-
tance where the potential diﬀerence of the outer well goes
through a minimum.

In such a case we expect a contribution from this tran-
sition in the wing and the formation of a CI line satellite,
if it is not smeared out by larger dipole-allowed contribu-
tions.

4 Lyman β proﬁle

The Lyman proﬁles and satellites shown here are calcu-
lated at the low densities met in the atmospheres of stars.
The typical particle densities from 1015 to 1017 cm−3 al-
lows us to use an expansion of the autocorrelation function
in powers of density as described in [21,31]. Line proﬁles
are normalized so that over ω they integrate to 1.

4.1 Collisional proﬁle perturbed by neutral H

We will consider the two following mechanisms which con-
tribute to the Lyman β wing.

The dipole moment taken between the initial and ﬁnal
states of a radiative transition determines the transition
probability, but for two atoms in collision, the moment
depends on their separation. This modiﬁes relative contri-
butions to the proﬁle along the collision trajectory. Dipole

– The far wing of allowed dipole lines, due to the free-free

transition in a pair of colliding atoms.

– The collision-induced absorption due to the free-free
transition involving the transient dipole moment ex-
isting during a binary collision.

The line proﬁle calculation shown Fig. 3 has been done
at a temperature of 10000 K for a perturber density of
1016 cm−3 of neutral hydrogen. The only line feature is a
broad CI satellite situated at 1150 ˚A in the far wing, due
to the B3-X dipole forbidden transition. Normally such
an eﬀect would be overshadowed by the allowed transition
wing, but in this case there is no large contribution of the
dipole allowed transitions in this region, as can be easily
predicted by the examination of Fig. 1. The extrema of
the allowed B4-X and D-X transitions occur for very short
distances, and are much smaller compared to the position
and depth of the outer well in the B3-X transition (see
Sect. 3.1 and 3.2).

The collision-induced absorption depends on the inter-
nuclear separation and produces very broad spectral lines
with a characteristic width of the order of the inverse of
the duration of the close collision. It is strongly dependent
on

– the temperature
– the amplitude of the dipole for Rmin when the potential

diﬀerence presents a minimum.

This emphasizes the importance of the accuracy of both
the potential energies and the dipole moments for the line
shape calculations.

Oscillatory structures appear near the 1150 ˚A satellite
as they appear between the line and the 1600 ˚A satellite
in both theory and experiment [1]. These oscillations were
predicted by Royer [32] and Sando et al. [33,34].

4.2 Simultaneous perturbations by H and H+

The complete Lyman β proﬁle perturbed by collisions with
neutral hydrogen and protons is shown in Fig 3. We notice
that the collision-induced H-H satellite is much broader
than the allowed H-H+ satellite since the dipole moment
diﬀers from zero only over a short range of internuclear
distances (see Sect. 4.1). The CI satellite of Lyman β is
quite far from the unperturbed Lyman β line center, actu-
ally closer to the Lyman α line. It is therefore necessary to
take into proper account the total contribution of both the
Lyman α and Lyman β wings of H perturbed simultane-
ously by neutrals and protons and to study the variation

of this part of the Lyman series with the relative density
of ionized and neutral atoms.

In [1] we evaluated both the Lyman α and Lyman β
wings of H perturbed by protons. However, we neglected
interference terms between the two lines. Equation (51)
of [1], which gives the proﬁle for a pair of lines such as
Lyman α and β, is

I(ω) = φ(0)
+ φ(0)

α enfα(0) Jα(ω − ωα)
β enfβ (0) Jβ(ω − ωβ) .

(32)

The perturbed line strength φ(0)
α enfα(0) diﬀers from the
free line strength φ(0)
α by the factor enfα(0). This density-
dependent factor expresses the fact that the total intensity
radiated increases or decreases when the dipole moment
is increased or decreased, on average, by the proximity of
perturbers. Because of the low densities we consider, we
have neglected this factor here.

We show the sum of the proﬁles of Lyman α and Ly-
man β in Fig. 4. We can see that a ratio of 5 between
the neutral and proton density is enough to make the CI

satellite appear in the far wing. The CI satellite appear-
ance is then very sensitive to the degree of ionization and
may be used as a temperature diagnostic.

5 Conclusions

In the case of Lyman α and the H-H+ Lyman β satellites,
the potential shape played a dominant role in the large
diﬀerence in the broadening of the quasi-molecular fea-
tures [30]. The width of the collision-induced absorption
is determined, for the most part, by the short range over
which the corresponding transition dipole moment is sig-
niﬁcant. In the CI satellite, it is the dipole moment which
is very important and which is responsible of the shape of
the satellite, the observation of such a satellite would be
a test of the accuracy of the dipole moment calculation.
Satellites due to allowed and forbidden transitions depend
linearly on density. The CI satellite is very sensitive to the
temperature of the absorption, and it may also be used as
a diagnostic tool for temperature. We emphasize that the

eﬀect of ﬁnite collision duration does play a role in the
shape of the far wing. The present calculations are done
in an adiabatic approximation using a rectilinear trajec-
tory. This should aﬀect slightly the shape of the satellite,
although no great error is expected. We are developing
methods to include trajectory eﬀects in the evaluation of
the line shape.

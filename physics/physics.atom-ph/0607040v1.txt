Abstract
The spin-dependent localized Hartree-Fock (SLHF) density-functional approach is extended to the treatment of the inner-shell
excited-state calculation of open-shell atomic systems. In this approach, the electron spin-orbitals in an electronic conﬁguration
are obtained by solving Kohn-Sham (KS) equation with SLHF exchange potential and the Slater’s diagonal sum rule is used
to evaluate the multiplet energy of an inner-shell excited state from the single-Slater-determinant energies of the electronic
conﬁgurations involved. This approach together with the correlation potentials and energy functionals proposed by Perdew
and Wang’s (PW) or Lee, Yang, and Parr’s (LYP) have been used to calculate the total and excitation energies of inner-shell
excited states of open-shell atomic systems: Li, B, Ne+, Ne2+, Ne3+, and Na. The results with the PW and LYP energy
functionals are in overall good agreement with each other and also with available experimental and other ab initio theoretical
data. Some new results for highly excited inner-shell states are presented.

INTRODUCTION

Due to computational simplicity and eﬃciency [1, 2]
density functional theory (DFT) [3, 4] has been widely
applied to many areas in theoretical physics and chem-
istry as a powerful ab initio approach for the calculation
of ground-state properties of many-electron systems. The
basic equation of DFT is Kohn-Sham (KS) equation [4]
and the key part in KS equation is exchange-correlation
(XC) potential [5]. Due to incomplete cancellation of
spurious self-interactions and inherent degeneracy (due
to the use of spin and angular-momentum independent
local potentials) of traditional XC potentials obtained
from uniform electron gas, such as local density approxi-
mation (LDA) [1, 2] and generalized gradient approxima-
tion (GGA) [1, 6, 7, 8, 9], the conventional DFT using
LDA or GGA is a ground-state approach. The diﬀer-
ences of the KS energy eigenvalues of unoccupied and
occupied orbitals are not rigorously deﬁned as excitation
energies. However, the KS energy eigenvalues can serve
as good zeroth-order excited-state energies provided they
are obtained by solving KS equation with a high-quality
XC potential [10]. A number of theoretical methods
have been developed by adopting this point of view [11].
In particular, density work-functional approach (WF)
[12, 13, 14, 15], open-shell localized Hartree-Fock (LHF)
density-functional approach [16, 17, 18, 19], and multiref-
erence LHF density-functional approach [20, 21], etc.,
have been successfully used to calculate excited-state
properties of atomic and molecular systems.

Recently,

an exchange

(X)-only LHF density-
functional theory has been proposed and successfully ap-
plied to ground-state calculations of atomic and molecu-
lar systems [10]. In this X-only DFT, the exchange po-
tential in the KS equation is a LHF exchange potential
derived under the assumption that X-only KS determi-
nant is equal to the Hartree-Fock (HF) determinant. We

have recently extended this approach to excited states
of atomic and molecular systems by assuming that the
X-only KS determinant is also equal to the HF determi-
nant for excited states [22]. Based on this postulate we
have developed a spin-dependent localized Hartree-Fock
(SLHF) density-functional approach for excited-state cal-
culation of atomic and molecular systems [22].
In this
approach, the exchange potential in the KS equation is
an exact nonvariational SLHF exchange potential con-
structed for both the ground and excited states. The
SLHF potential is an analogue of the LHF potential. It
is self-interaction free and exhibits the correct long-range
behavior. Further, the SLHF potential requires the use
of only the occupied orbitals and is dependent of the or-
bital symmetry of the state. This approach associating
with Slater’s diagonal sum rule [23] has been successfully
used to calculate multiply excited states of valence elec-
trons of atomic systems [22] and inner-shell excitation of
close-shell atomic systems [24] with accurate results.

In this paper, we extend the SLHF density-functional
approach to inner-shell excited states of open-shell
atomic systems. We compute the total and excitation
energies of inner-shell excited states of open-shell atomic
systems: Li, B, Ne+, Ne2+, Ne3+, and Na. In the calcu-
lation, the correlation potentials and energy functionals
proposed by Perdew and Wang (PW) [9] and by Lee,
Yang, and Parr (LYP) [8] are used to estimate electron
correlation eﬀect. We will show that the calculated re-
sults are in overall good agreement with available the-
oretical and experimental data. We also present some
new results for the highly excited inner-shell states for
the ﬁrst time.

II. THEORETICAL METHOD

The SLHF density-functional approach has been dis-
cussed in Ref. [22] in detail and is outlined in this section

for convenience.

and

In spin-dependent density-functional approach, a spin-
orbital ϕiσ (r) of the ith electron with spin σ (σ = α and
β for spin-up and spin-down, respectively) and its orbital
energy εiσ are determined by the KS equation

where,

Hσ(r)ϕiσ (r) = εiσϕiσ (r) ,

Hσ(r) = −

σ (r) ,

(2)

is the KS Hamiltonian and

σ (r) = Vext (r) + VH (r) + Vxcσ (r) ,
V eﬀ
is the local eﬀective potential. In Eq. (3), Vext (r) is the
external potential, VH (r) is Hartree potential (classical
Coulomb electrostatic potential between electrons), and
Vxcσ (r) is the XC potential.

(3)

For a given atomic system, the external potential
Vext (r) is known exactly. The Hartree potential VH (r)
is given by

VH (r) =

ρ (r′)
|r − r′|

dr′

Z

(4)

where, ρ (r) = ρα (r) + ρβ (r) is the total electron den-
sity and ρσ (r) (for σ = α and β) is the spin-dependent
electron density deﬁned by

ρσ (r) =

wiσ |ϕiσ (r)|2 .

(5)

Nσ

Xi=1

Here Nσ is the number of electrons with spin σ and wiσ
is the occupied number of electrons in the spin-orbital
ϕiσ (r).

The XC potential can be decomposed into the ex-
change potential Vxσ (r) and the correlation potential
Vcσ (r). In the SLHF density-functional approach, the ex-
(r).
change potential is a SLHF exchange potential V SLHF
It is given by

orbitals.

The SLHF exchange potential determined by Eqs. (6)–
(10) has two arbitrary additive constants. The physical
orbitals can only be obtained by the use of appropriate
constants in the exchange potential [10]. To settle down
the constants so as to pick up the physical orbitals, it
is required that the highest-occupied-orbital Nσ of each

In this case, the correction term V C
tially, the SLHF exchange potential behaves asymptoti-
cally as Slater potential and thus approaches to −1/r at
long range [10].

In atomic systems, an electron spin-orbital is charac-
terized by three quantum numbers n, l, and σ, where
n and l are the principal quantum number and orbital
angular momentum quantum number of the electron, re-
spectively. In the spherical coordinates, the spin-orbital
ϕiσ (r) of an electron with quantum numbers n, l, and σ
can be expressed by

ϕiσ (r) =

where, Rnlσ(r) is the radial spin-orbital, Ylm(θ, φ) is the
spherical harmonic, m is the azimuthal quantum number,
and i is a set of quantum numbers apart from spin σ of the
spin-orbital. The radial spin-orbital Rnlσ(r) is governed
by radial KS equation,

Here the symbol νσ stands for a set of quantum num-

is accurate for spherically symmetric (close-shell) states,
but it is only an approximation for non-spherically sym-
metric (open-shell) states. It may induce an error when
it is used to evaluate the energy of a non-spherically sym-
metric state. However, the error is negligible compared
to the order of calculated multiplet splitting [11].

To calculate electron spin-orbital, the Legendre gen-
eralized pseudospectral (LGPS) method [25] is used to
discretize the radial KS equation (12). This method asso-
ciated with an appropriate mapping technique can over-
come diﬃculties due to singularity at r = 0 and long-tail
at large r of Coulomb interaction and thus provides a
very eﬀective and eﬃcient numerical algorithm for high-
precision solution of KS equation. Using the electron
spin-orbitals of an electronic conﬁguration, a single Slater
determinant for a speciﬁc electronic state is constructed
and its total energy calculated. The total energy is a
sum of non-interacting kinetic-energy Ek, external-ﬁeld
energy Eext, Hartree energy EH , exchange energy Ex,
and correlation energy Ec. The values of Ek, Eext, EH ,
and Ex are evaluated by

For a multiplet state that can be described completely
by a single Slater determinant, the energy is calculated
directly from the single Slater determinant. For a multi-
plet state that cannot be represented by a single determi-
nant, the energy can be calculated by means of Slater’s
diagonal sum rule [23]. According to this rule, a sum over
single-Slater-determinant energy E(Di) of determinant
Di from an electron conﬁguration equals to a weighted
sum over multiplet energy E(Mj ) of multiplet state Mj
involved in the same electron conﬁguration, namely,

E(Di) =

dj E(Mj),

(24)

where, the weight dj is the times that the multiplet state
Mj appears in all the single Slater determinants. Similar
procedures have been employed in recent excited-state
calculations [14, 15, 26].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The procedure described in the preceding section is ex-
tended to calculate the total energies (E) and excitation
energies (∆E) of inner-shell excited states of open-shell
atomic systems: Li, B, Ne+, Ne2+, Ne3+, and Na. In the
calculations, the correlation eﬀect, which is character-
ized by the correlation potential vcσ (r) and correlation
energy Ec, is taken into account through the correlation
potentials and energy functionals of Perdew and Wang
(PW) [9] and of Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) [8], respec-
tively. The results obtained with these two correlation
energy functionals are listed in columns PW and LYP in
the following tables, respectively.

A.

Inner-shell excitation of Li

Inner-shell excitation of Li has been the subject of ex-
tensive experimental and theoretical studies. Both exper-
imental [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35] and theoretical
data [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]
In TABLE I to TABLE III we present
are abundant.
the total and excitation energies of our calculations with
PW and LYP correlation potentials and energy function-
als for inner-shell excited states 1s2sns 2,4S (n = 2 ∼ 8),

1s2snp 2,4P (n = 2 ∼ 8), and 1s2p2 2S, 2,4P , and
2D, respectively. For comparison we also list in these
tables representative experimental data [29, 31, 34] as
well as theoretical results obtained from calculations us-
ing density work-functional formalism (WF) [36], saddle-
point complex-rotation (SPCR) [37, 38, 39, 40], extensive
conﬁguration-interaction calculation (ECI) [43, 44, 45,
46], and Rayleigh-Ritz variational method (RRV) [49].

For the total energies of inner-shell excited states
1s2sns 2,4S listed in TABLE I, the maximum relative
discrepancies of our PW and LYP results are 0.10% and
0.32% to the WF results, 0.21% and 0.43% to the SPCR
results, and 0.19% and 0.62% to the ECI results, respec-
tively. This indicates that both the PW and LYP re-
sults are in good agreement with WF, SPCR, and ECI
results, and the PW results are a little bit better than
the LYP results. For the excitation energy of excited
state 1s2s2 2S, the maximum relative deviations of our
PW and LYP results and the WF results are 0.91%,
1.65%, and 1.25%, respectively, to the experimental re-
sults. This demonstrates that the PW result is better
than both the LYP and WF results. For excited states
1s2sns 2S (n ≥ 3), other theoretical results of excitation
energy are not available. For these states the maximum
relative discrepancies of our PW and LYP results of ex-
citation energies to the experimental results are 1.45%
and 2.75%, respectively. For the excited state 1s2s3s 4S,
the maximum relative deviations of our PW and LYP
results of excitation energies to the experimental result
are 0.75% and 1.60%, respectively. While the maximum
relative discrepancies of the ECI and RRV results to the
experimental result are 0.59% and 0.50%, respectively.
Hence our PW result is in good agreement with both
the experimental result and other theoretical results for
this state. For excited states 1s2sns 4S (n > 3) there
is no experimental data available. For these states, the
maximum relative deviations of our PW and LYP results
to the RRV results are 0.68% and 1.39%, respectively.
Thus our PW results are close to the RRV results. For
the all the results above the PW results are better than
the LYP results. As will be shown, due to overestima-
tion of LYP energy functional to correlation energies of
atomic systems with smaller Z [8, 22], the LYP results
are generally worse than the PW results for atomic sys-
tems with Z ≤ 8.

For the total energies of excited states 1s2snp 2,4P
given in TABLE II, the maximum relative discrepancies
of our PW and LYP results are 0.56% and 0.89% to
the WF results, 0.64% and 1.03% to the SPCR results,
and 0.25% and 0.82% to the ECI results, respectively.
This illustrates that both the PW and LYP results are
in agreement with the complicated ab initio methods.
For the excitation energy of excited state 1s2s2p 4P , the
maximum relative deviations of our PW and LYP re-
sults to the experimental results are 0.38% and 1.66%,
while the maximum relative discrepancies of the WF,
ECI, and RRV results to the experimental results are
1.423%, 0.03%, and 0.07%, respectively. For excitation

4

energy of the excited state 1s2s2p 2P , the maximum rel-
ative discrepancies of the PW, LYP, and WF results to
the experimental result are 0.05%, 1.70%, and 1.85%, re-
spectively. For excitation energy of the state 1s2s3p 2P ,
the maximum relative deviations of the PW, LYP, and
WF results to the experimental result are 1.35%, 2.73%,
and 1.11%, respectively. Thus the PW results are better
than the LYP results and a little bit better than the WF
results.

For the total energies of inner-shell doubly excited
states 1s2p2 2S, 2,4P , and 2D given in TABLE III, the
maximum relative deviations of our PW and LYP re-
sults are 0.63% and 0.75% to the WF results, 0.47% and
0.78% to both the SPCR and ECI results, respectively.
This demonstrates that the PW energy functional has al-
most the same precision as the LYP energy functional in
calculation of total energies of these inner-shell excited
states. For excitation energies, the relative discrepancies
of our PW and LYP results to the experimental result
are less than 1.10% and 1.50%, respectively, while the
maximum relative discrepancies of the WF results to the
experimental results are 1.09%. Hence the PW results
are very close to the WF results and a little bit better
than the LYP results.

B.

Inner-shell excitation of B

The second open-shell atom for which the total ener-
gies of inner-shell excited states are computed is B. In
TABLE IV we present Auger transition energies from
the inner-shell excited states 1s2s22p2 2S, 2,4P , and 2D
of B to the singly excited states 1s22s2p 1,3P and the
doubly excited states 1s22p2 1S, 3P , and 1D of B+. For
comparison we also give in this table the available ex-
perimental results [34] as well as theoretical results from
WF [36], perturbation Z-expansion theory (PZE) [50, 51],
and perturbation Z-expansion theory with relativistic ef-
fects (RPZE) [34]. Except for the transitions 1s2s22p2
2D → 1s22p2 1S and 1s2s22p2 2S → 1s22p2 1S, the
maximum deviations of our PW and LYP results to the
experimental results are 0.634% and 0.241%, while the
maximum discrepancies of the WF, PZE, and RPZE re-
sults to the experimental results are 0.783%, 1.211%,
and 0.4091%, respectively. This indicates that our re-
sults are much better than the PZE results, a little bit
better than the WF results, and much closer to the
RPZE results. The maximum deviations of the PW,
LYP, PZE, and RPZE results to the experimental results
are 1.821%, 1.033%, 3.257%, and 0.07% for the transition
1s2s22p2 2D → 1s22p2 1S and 0.437%, 1.232%, 1.392%,
and 0.04% for the transition 1s2s22p2 2S → 1s22p2 1S,
respectively. This indicates again that our results are
better than the PZE results. In addition, according to
our result the spectrum line with 170.7 eV previously
signed to the transition 1s2s22p2 2D → 1s22p2 1S may
likely belong to the transition 1s2s22p2 2D → 1s22p2 3P

Inner-shell excitation of positive ions Ne+,

results for these atomic systems with Z = 10 [22, 24].

Ne2+, and Ne+

To explore the feasibility of the approach to inner-shell
excitation of atomic ions, we also apply the procedure
to inner-shell excited-state calculations of positive ions
Ne+, Ne2+, and Ne3+.
In TABLE V we present the
excitation energies of optically allowed transitions in-
volved in inner-shell excited states of these ions along
with the theoretical results of multiconﬁguration Dirac-
Fock (MCDF) method [52]. Note that the MCDF results
here are the weighted-averaged values of those given in
[52]. The maximum relative deviations of our PW and
LYP results to the MCDF results are 0.171% and 0.071%
for Ne+, 0.162% and 0.059% for Ne2+, and 0.159% and
0.081% for Ne3+, respectively. Thus the agreement of
our results with the MCDF results are quite satisfac-
tory, demonstrating that the SLHF together with PW
and LYP correlation potentials is accurate for the calcu-
lation of inner-shell excited states of Ne positive ions. In
addition, the LYP results are more accurate than the PW

D.

Inner-shell excitation of Na

Finally we compute the total energies and excitation
energies for inner-shell excited states 1s2s22p63s(1S)np
2P (n = 3 ∼ 8) and 1s2s22p63s(3S)np 2,4P (n = 3 ∼ 8)
of Na. The results are shown in TABLE VI together
with the theoretical results from relativistic conﬁgura-
tion interaction method (RCI) [53] and multiconﬁgura-
tion Hartree-Fock method (MCHF) [54] as well as the
experimental results (Exp.) [55] for comparison.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the procedure developed for excited-state
calculation based on the SLHF density functional ap-
proach and Slater’s diagonal sum rule has been extended
to the treatment of inner-shell excited states of atomic
systems. In this procedure, the electron spin-orbitals in
an electronic conﬁguration are obtained ﬁrst by solving
the KS equation with the exact SLHF exchange potential.
Then a single-Slater-determinant energy of the electronic
conﬁguration is calculated by using these electron spin-
orbitals. Finally, a multiplet energy of an excited state is
evaluated from the single-Slater-determinant energies of
the electronic conﬁgurations involved in terms of Slater’s
diagonal sum rule. The key part of this procedure is the
SLHF exchange potential. We have applied this proce-
dure to the calculations of total energies and excitation
energies of inner-shell excited states of open-shell atomic
systems: Li, B, Ne+, Ne2+, Ne3+, and Na. The corre-

lation eﬀect is taken care of by incorporating the PW
and LYP correlation potentials and energy functionals
into calculation. The results from the calculations with
LYP and PW energy functionals and energy functionals
are in overall good agreement with each other and also
with the available more sophisticated ab initio theoret-
ical results and experimental data. This demonstrates
that the SLHF density-functional approach can provide
a simple and computationally eﬃcient approach for the
accurate calculation of inner-shell excited states of open-
shell atomic systems within DFT.

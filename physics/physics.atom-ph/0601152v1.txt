Abstract

We calculate the energies of ground and three low lying excited states of conﬁned helium

atom centered in an impenetrable spherical box. We perform the calculation by employing

variational method with two-parameter variational forms for the correlated two-particle

wave function. With just two variational parameters we get quite accurate results for both

ground and excited state energies.

INTRODUCTION

Recently considerable attention has been focused on the study of spatially conﬁned

atoms and molecules [1, 2, 3]. The conﬁned atomic and molecular systems show

substantially diﬀerent ground state and response properties as compared to their free

counterparts. The main reason for the spatially conﬁned models of atoms and ions to

attract tremendous amount of attention is their applicability to several problems of

physics and chemistry. For example, atoms trapped in cavities, zeolite channel [4, 5]

or encapsulated in hollow cages of carbon based nano-materials, such as endohedral

fullerenes [6, 7] and in nanobubbles formed around foreign objects in the environment

of liquid helium and under high pressure in the walls of nuclear reactors [8] are all

relevant to the conﬁned atom model. The models of conﬁned atomic and molecular

system have also found application in the investigation of eﬀect of high pressure on

the physical properties of atoms, ions and molecules [9, 10]. The study of conﬁned

atoms also provides insight into various properties of the quantum nanostructures like

quantum dots or artiﬁcial atoms [11, 12]. The detail discussion on these applications

are available in several review articles [1, 2, 3].

The ﬁrst model of conﬁned (compressed) hydrogen atom in an impenetrable spher-

ical cavity was proposed by Michels et al.

[9] to simulate the eﬀect of pressure on

hydrogen atom and this model was employed to study the variation of static dipole

polarizability with the eﬀective pressure acting on the surface.

In this model the

boundary condition that the wave function vanishes at r = rc ( where rc is the ra-

dius of impenetrable spherical box) is imposed on the solution of the Schrodinger

equation. Later various physical properties of conﬁned hydrogen atom, such as the

modiﬁcation of their atomic orbitals, energy levels, the ﬁlling of electronic shells,

linear and nonlinear polarizabilities have been reported in the literature ( see Ref.

[1] and references theirin). Besides hydrogen atom, eﬀect of conﬁnement by an im-

penetrable as well as non-impenetrable spherical box, on many-electron atoms have

also been considered [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Helium atom being the simplest

many-electron system, the conﬁned version of this atom provides a lucid way to study

the eﬀect of conﬁnement on the electron correlation which arises due to the coulomb

interaction between the two electrons. Most of the studies on the conﬁned helium

atom are devoted to the calculation of the ground state energies and some averages

and their evolution with the size of the spherical box. In majority of these studies

Raleigh-Ritz variational method was employed with modiﬁed Hylleraas-type wave

function (Hylleraas-type wave functions multiplied with appropriate cut-oﬀ factor)

fulﬁlling the conﬁnement boundary condition mentioned above [13, 14, 19]. Besides

variational method, self consistent Hartree-Fock [15], conﬁguration interaction [16]

and a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) [18] methods have also been used to study the

properties of helium atom and several isoelectronic ions conﬁned in an impenetrable

spherical box.

In this paper we report calculations of energies of the ground state and some low

lying excited states of helium atom conﬁned at the center of an impenetrable spherical

box and study the variation of the energies with the size of the sphere. We note here

that in comparison to the calculation of ground state energy very few studies on the

evolution of excited state energies with the size exist in the literature [20, 21]. There-

fore, main emphasis of the present paper is on the eﬀect of conﬁnement on some of

the low lying excited states of compressed helium atom. The low lying excited states
considered in this paper are 3S(1s2s), 1P (1s2p) and 3P (1s2p). Recently, Patil and

Varshni [20] have calculated the the energies of the above mentioned excited states

by replacing the electron-electron interaction by an eﬀective screening of the nuclear

charge. The screening factor is then determined by using an interpolation between

the expressions for large and small values of the conﬁning radius. In the present pa-

per calculations are performed by employing more accurate variational method with

two-parameter correlated wave functions for both ground and the excited states. The

correlated wave functions explicitly take the eﬀect of electron-electron interaction into

account and consequently expected to yield accurate results. The variational forms

for the wave functions we use in this paper are generalization of the correlated wave

functions proposed by Le Sech and co-workers [22, 23, 24, 25] for free two-electron

atomic and molecular systems. The generalized wave functions for calculations of

conﬁned helium atom are constructed by multiplying the Le Sech type wave func-

tions with appropriate cut-oﬀ factors so that the conﬁnement boundary condition is

satisﬁed.

In addition to the conﬁnement boundary condition these wave functions

also fulﬁll both electron-nucleus and electron-electron cusp conditions. The cusp con-

ditions arise due to the Coulomb interaction between the charged particles and the

true wave functions of many electron systems must satisfy these conditions [26]. At

this point it is important to note that all previous variational calculations involved

more than two variational parameters. We demonstrate that the two-parameter cal-

culations performed in this paper yield quite accurate results and match well with

the results of some accurate calculations already exist in the literatures.

The remaining paper is organized in the following manner. In section II we describe

the theoretical methods employed in this paper. The section III is devoted to the

discussion of the results. The paper is concluded in section IV.

II. METHOD OF CALCULATION

tems with nuclear charge Z can be written as ( in atomic units)

In order to perform variational calculation we need to make a judicious choice for

R

the ansatz of two-particle wave function. To this end we generalize the variational

form for wave function ψ(r1, r2) proposed by Le Sech and co-workers [22, 23, 24, 25].

The generalized variational form of the wave function, complying with the boundary

condition imposed by the conﬁning potential, employed in this paper is given by.

This form of the wave function is inspired by the concept of semi separability, in-

troduced by Pluvinage [27]. Following Ref.

[22, 23, 24, 25] φ(r1, r2) is chosen in

such a way that it only includes the wave function of the free electrons in the ﬁeld of

nucleus and Ω(r1, r2) contains the dependence of inter-electronic distance r12 needed

to represent the correlation arising due to coulomb interaction between the electrons.

Moreover, the presence of cut-oﬀ factor

ensures the satisfaction

of boundary condition imposed by the conﬁning potential on the wave function. In

(cid:17) (cid:16)

(cid:17)

addition to the satisfaction of conﬁning boundary condition the above form of the

cut-oﬀ factor also guarantees the fulﬁllment of the electron-nucleus cusp condition by

the correlated wave function. The satisfaction of cusp condition by the variational

wave function leads to improvement in the rate of convergence of Rayleigh-Ritz varia-

tional calculations and also yields more accurate energies [26]. We note here that the

calculations performed with linear form of the cut-oﬀ factor

ing to trial wave functions that do not satisfy electron-nucleus cusp condition, give

(cid:17) (cid:16)

(cid:16)

less accurate results for the ground as well as the excited state energies, specially in

the strong conﬁnement regime. Consequently, in this paper we employ the quadratic

form of the cut-oﬀ factor as given by Eq. (6). For detail discussion on the various

asymptotic and cusp properties satisﬁed by the Le Sech form of the wave function

we refer the reader to Ref. [25]. With this choice for the variational form of the cor-

related wave function, the energy functional (5) reduces to a single multidimensional

sponding energies are presented in the next section along with the results they yield

for conﬁned helium atom.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section we present the results of our calculations and compare them with

the results already available in the literature. First we discuss the results for the

ground state energy and its variation with the size of the spherical box followed by

the results for some of the low lying excited states of conﬁned helium atom.

A. Ground state

written as

The form of the function φ(r1, r2) for the ground state 1S(1s2) of helium atom is

φ(r1, r2) = A (1s(r1)1s(r2)) [α(1)β(2) − α(2)β(1)]

(8)

where A is the normalization constant, 1s(r) represents the ground state hydrogenic

orbital and α(i) and β(j) denote the spin-up and spin-down functions respectively.

To perform the calculations we next choose the form of function Ω(r1, r2, r12), which

describes the correlation between the electrons arising due to the coulomb interaction

as

Ω(r1, r2, r12) = cosh λr1 cosh λr2

1 +

(9)

r12e−ar12

1
2

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

where λ and a are the two variational parameters which are determined by mini-

mization of the energy functional (7). The above form of Ω(r1, r2, r12) consists of two

parts, namely, the screening part represented by the cosh hyperbolic functions and

purely r12 dependent correlated part. The r12 part of the the function was proposed

by Hischfelder [28] and its applicability has been demonstrated for several many-

electron systems up to beryllium atom [22, 23, 24, 25, 29]. This function provides

right description of electron-electron cusp condition. In accordance with Ref.

[25]

we choose to represent the screening part of Ω(r1, r2, r12) by cosh hyperbolic func-

tions which fulﬁll the cusp condition at the nucleus and also right behaviour at large

electron-nucleus distances. However, in contrast to the Ref.

[25] we represent the

screening part by product of cosh hyperbolic functions at r1 and r2 instead of the

sum of two functions. Although the product form of the screening part considered

in this paper overestimates the screening, nonetheless we ﬁnd that this form leads

reasonably accurate result for the ground state energy of an uncompressed or a free

helium atom. The diﬀerence between our result for the ground state of uncompressed

helium atom and the one obtained with sum of two cosh hyperbolic functions [25] is

of the order of 0.002 a.u.. Having assessed the accuracy of our ansatz for the ground

state energy of free helium atom we now proceed with the calculation of energies for

conﬁned helium atom as a function of size of the conﬁning spherical box.

In Table I we present the results of our calculations for energies of 1S(1s2) state

of helium atom as a function of rc along with the corresponding results available in

the literature. In order to check the accuracy of our results we make a comparison

with the results of some very accurate calculations based on correlated wave function

[14, 19] and QMC [18] approaches. It can be clearly seen from Table I that our results

are slightly lower than the corresponding numbers of Ref.

[14] especially for small

values of rc.

It is important to note here that in Ref.

[14] ground state energies

were obtained by employing three-parameter variational calculation with diﬀerent

form for the function of r12. On the other hand our results are slightly higher than

the results obtained both with the thirteen-parameter (ten linear and three nonlinear)

Hylleraas wave function variational calculation [19] and the most accurate QMC based

method. In the strong conﬁnement regime (that is for small values of rc) the maximum

diﬀerence between our results and those of Ref. [18, 19] is of the order of 0.006 a.u..

The results presented in Table I clearly demonstrate that the two-parameter ansatz

used in this paper to calculate the ground state energies of conﬁned helium atom

gives quite accurate results for wide range of size of the conﬁning spherical box.

B. Excited states

Now we apply the variational approach discussed above to calculate the energies

of some low lying singly excited states and study their variations with the size of

the spherical box. Following, Ref.

[22, 24] the φ(r1, r2) part of the correlated wave

function for the excited state 1snl (where n is the principal quantum and l is the

orbital angular momentum quantum number of the state to which one electron is

excited) is chosen as

φ(r1, r2) = A [1s(r1)nl(r2) ± 1s(r2)nl(r1)] χs(1, 2)

(10)

where nl(r) is hydrogenic orbital with quantum number n and l and χs(1, 2) repre-

sents the spinor part of the wave function. The spinor part can be easily constructed

by using spin-up α(i) and spin-down β(j) functions such that the total wave func-

tion should be antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of spatial and spin

co-ordinates of two electrons. For calculation of energies of excited states the screen-

ing cum r12 dependent part of the wave function is chosen as

Ω(r1, r2, r12) = (cosh λr1 + cosh λr2)

1 +

(11)

r12e−ar12

1
2

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

The screening part in the above equation (Eq. (11)) is motivated by the work of

Ref. [23]. Note that the form of screening part of the wave function for excited state

calculation is diﬀerent from that of ground state calculation. We ﬁnd that product

form leads to less accurate results for the excited state of uncompressed or free he-

lium atom. Consequently, for excited state calculation we employ the above form

(Eq. (11)) which has already been shown to yield accurate results for the excited

states of two-electron systems [23]. By using φ(r1, r2) given by Eq. (10) we calculate

energies of some low lying excited states for which the values of quantum number

l or diﬀerent spin state automatically ensures the orthogonality. These states are
3S(1s2s), 1P (1s2p) and 3P (1s2p). Before presenting the results for the conﬁned he-

lium atom we note that with Eqs. (10) and (11) we get quite accurate results for the
excited states of uncompressed helium atom. For excited state 3S(1s2s) of uncom-

pressed helium atom we get E = −2.1743 a.u.

in comparison to the most accurate

value of E = −2.1752 a.u. [30] (here we quote up to fourth-decimal place only). On
the other hand, our calculation for 1P (1s2p) and 3P (1s2p) states of uncompressed

helium atom give E = −2.1227 a.u. and E = −2.1281 a.u. respectively, whereas the

corresponding values of energies from accurate calculations are E = −2.1238 a.u. and

E = −2.1332 a.u. [31] (here we quote up to fourth-decimal place only) respectively.

The results for energies of three excited states mentioned above and their variations

with respect to rc are presented in Table II along with the corresponding results from

Ref. [20] in parenthesis. The comparison of two results clearly shows that our num-
bers for 3S(1s2s) states are lower than the corresponding number of Ref.

[20] for

almost whole range of rc considered in this paper except for rc = 1.0 a.u.. Moreover,
for 3S(1s2s) state two results diﬀer signiﬁcantly in the range rc = 2.0 − 9.0a.u.. In
contrast to 3S(1s2s) state case, our results for 1P (1s2p) state are slightly lower than

[20] for all values of rc excepting rc = 1.0 a.u..
the corresponding numbers of Ref.
Finally, we note from Table II that unlike excited states 3S(1s2s) and 1P (1s2p) our
results for the excited state 3P (1s2p) are lower than the corresponding results of Ref.
[20] only in the range rc = 2.0 − 9.0 a.u.. Beyond rc = 9.0 a.u. results obtained by

us are little higher than those of Ref.

[20]. The lower values of energies for excited

states obtained by our variational calculation particularly in the strong conﬁnement

regime suggests that our results may be more accurate than those of Ref. [20].

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have calculated the energies for ground and some excited states of

conﬁned helium atom by employing Raleigh-Ritz variational method. To perform the

variational calculation we have used two-parameter variational forms for two-electron

correlated wave function taking into account the boundary condition imposed by

the conﬁnement. The results obtained by us for the ground state is quite accurate

within the strong conﬁnement region and match well with the corresponding results

of other accurate calculations. For excites states not many results are available in the

literature. We have made comparison of our results for the excited states with the

numbers from an interpolation based approach published recently. The comparison of

results shows that our variation method with two-parameter wave function is capable

of giving quite accurate numbers for the excited states of conﬁned helium atom for a

wide range of values of conﬁnement radius. We feel that our results for the excited

states will be an important contribution to the spectroscopic properties of conﬁned

helium atom and accuracy of these results can be further tested by more sophisti-

cated calculations. The study of conﬁned two-electron systems can be extended in

several directions. The calculations of response properties like linear and nonlinear

polarizabilities will provide information about the interaction of conﬁned system with

external electromagnetic ﬁeld. Currently we are studying the eﬀect of conﬁnement

on the linear and nonlinear polarizabilities of conﬁned helium atom.

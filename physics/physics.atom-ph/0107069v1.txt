We develop an Over Barrier Model for computing charge exchange between ions and one-active-
electron atoms at low impact energies. The main feature of the model is the treatment of the
barrier crossing process by the electron within a simpliﬁed quantum mechanical formulation which
takes into account: (a) the probability of electron reﬂection even for over-barrier scattering, and (b)
the discreteness of receiving atom’s quantum levels by strongly suppressing captures far from the
resonance condition E(classical) = E(quantum-mechanical). It is shown that inclusion only of eﬀect
(a) allows for a moderate improvement over other similar models, while including also (b) represents
a remarkable improvement. We implement and discuss also the probability of electron re-capture
by the target.

I. INTRODUCTION

Charge exchange processes between slow atomic particles are of great importance in plasma
physics and astrophysics. With “slow” we mean that the interparticle velocity is smaller than the
classical velocity of the exchanged electron.
While only quantum mechanical methods can give really accurate computations of all of the basic
quantities for these processes, i.e. total and partial or diﬀerential cross sections, less precise but
simpler methods can still be highly valuable when only moderate accuracy is sought. In the medium-
to-high impact velocity range most preferences go to the Classical Trajectory Monte carlo (CTMC)
method, which is also more and more often successfully applied also to the low velocity range (see
e.g. [1,2] for a discussion and some recent improvements on this subject). However, the CTMC
method has two disadvantages: (i) it is entirely numerical in character, thus somewhat masking the
underlying physics; (ii) it relies on large numbers of simulations, thus being rather time-consuming.
For these reasons, analytical or semi-analytical methods can still be useful. Over barrier models
(OBM) are an example of these models. They are known since a long time [3] and are still being
improved to include as much physics as possible [4–8].
In this work we present a new version of the OBM. It is based upon the papers [7,8], which were based
in their turn upon the work [5]. However, this one is more than a simple reﬁnement, in that a fairly
diﬀerent way of computing quantities is followed. We adopt here the approach of [6], assuming that it
is always possible to improve any classical model by turning to a mixed description where some terms
are computed using quantum mechanics: one main defect of model [5] is that it very often predicts
too large a capture probability.
It forced us to artiﬁcially reduce it in works [7,8] by arbitrarily
reducing the capture region. We ﬁnd here that a decisive-and more self-consistent–improvement to
OBM is achieved if the potential–barrier–crossing process by the electron is described as a quantum
mechanical process. We do that in two steps: ﬁrst of all the fraction of electrons crossing the
barrier from the target atom to the projectile, which classically is a term of exclusively geometrical
origin, is corrected by a factor ft < 1.
It accounts for the fact that a ﬂux of quantal objects
impinging on a potential hill suﬀers partial reﬂection even if their kinetic energy is larger than the
hill’s height. Section II is devoted to an overview of the model and to a very simpliﬁed yet eﬀective
way of estimating ft. In sec. III the model is tested against a number of cases. We will ﬁnd good
agreement for some of them, but still huge overstimations of the capture cross section for a number
of others. We relate this to the fact that–within the classical picture–the ﬂux of electrons to the
projectile is a continuos stream while, quantum–mechanically, it is a resonant process, occurring
only when the conditions are satisﬁed for which the electron binds to a quantized energy level. In
section IV we try to implement this feature by adding a further correction term, w, which is zero
far from the resonance condition. The performances of the model are thus shown in section V to be
remarkably improved.

It is important to notice that, although quantum mechanical corrections are empirically added
to ﬁnd convergence with experiments and/or other computations, no ﬁtting parameters are added:
instead, any new parameter needed is evaluated on the basis of (semi)quantitative reasoning: once
one accepts the classical–quantal mixed description, the model is entirely self-consistent. Another
important point to stress is that our goal is to merge the QM treatment within the classical one
without burdening too much the resulting computations. We shall show that through a drastical
simpliﬁcation of the QM computations we are able to have at the same time rather accurate results
written in terms of simple formulas.

Finally, we try to implement in a consistent fashion within the model the possibility by the target
of re-capturing the electron once it has been bound to the projectile. This eﬀect, in principle, should
be important for collisions between equal particles. It will be shown that the eﬀect is very small–or
even negligible–when the two particles are diﬀerent. However, we shall show that, even for collisions
between like particles, taking it into account leads to a degradation of the performances. A possible
explanation is attempted for this unexpected behaviour.

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE OBM

We consider a scattering experiment between a nucleus T with an active electron e, and a pro-
jectile nucleus P. Let r be the electron position relative to T and R the relative distance between T
and P. Let us further consider all the three particles lying within the same plane
. We can label
the direction along the internuclear axis as the z axis and describe the position of the electron using
cylindrical coordinates (ρ, z, φ
0). The two nuclei are considered as approaching at a velocity very
small if compared to the orbital electron velocity. The total energy of the electron is

where Zp and Zt are the eﬀective charge of the projectile and of the target seen by the electron,
respectively (we are considering hydrogenlike approximations for both the target and the projectile).
Atomic units are used unless otherwise stated.

Roots ρ, z of this equation mark the limits of the region classically allowed to the electron. When
this region is disconnected into two circles centered around each of the two nuclei. As
R
R diminishes the two regions can eventually merge.
It is the opening of the equipotential curve
between T and P which leads to a leakage of electrons from one nucleus to another, and therefore
to charge exchange. It is possible to solve Eq. (3) in the limit of vanishing width of the opening
(ρ

0), and ﬁnd:

In the region of the opening the potential has a saddle structure: along the internuclear axis it has
a maximum at

In our work, following [5], we assume that the electron is in a low angular momentum state (e.g.
s states), thus unperturbed classical electron trajectories can be visualized as straight lines along
radial direction from the target nucleus. We assume also that the qualitative shape of the trajectory
be not changed by the collision: the electron free falls towards P.

Let us now explain the meaning of the terms in the right hand side of this equation: in the ﬁrst term
we identify Nt as the fraction of classical particles which at time t leave the target as a consequence
of their motion.
It is simply a geometrical factor: assuming an uniform distribution of electron
trajectories, it is equal to the ratio between the solid angle intercepting the opening and the total
4π solid angle. The azimuthal integration is straightforward and thus

A useful approximation is to expand eq. (8) and then eq. (7) in powers of ρm/R and retain only
terms up to the second order. This was justiﬁed in the original paper [5] by the need of accurately
modelling far-collisions. However, this approximation turned out to be a rather accurate one since
close encounters are weighted in the ﬁnal cross section by the (small) impact parameter, thus even
a rough estimate is not so much important.
After this approximation the calculation is straightforward, and we ﬁnd

The parameter Tt is the classical period of the electron bound to T. It accounts for the fact that if
the classical phases within the ensemble of the electrons are randomly distributed, during the time
interval dt only the fraction dt/Tt come through the opening. The period can be calculated using
the semiclassical relation Tt = 2πn3
ef f (see e.g. [7]) with nef f an eﬀective quantum number for the
electron bound to T, which can be computed from eq. (2) by putting

Finally, ft accounts for quantum mechanical corrections to the barrier crossing probability. Clas-
1, while a ﬂux of quantum mechanical particles impinging on a potential barrier is
sically ft
reduced to a factor ft < 1 even though the kinetic energy of the particles is larger than the height
of the hill.
In order to reduce computations to an easily manageable form we replace the true potential proﬁle by
a square barrier, which allows getting analytical results: in ﬁgure (1) we draw a schematic picture of
the potential proﬁle along the internuclear axis: as it is (left-hand ﬁgure), and as it is approximated
(right-hand ﬁgure). The horizontal line labelled by “e” marks the energy of the electron. The zero
of the potential well associated at the target is chosen so that the binding energy of the electron is
′
equal to its unpertubed value En, and analogously E
n is the binding energy to the projectile (till
known undeﬁned). The potential barrier between the two nuclei is depressed so that the electron
is able to cross it with a kinetic energy ∆E. The width of the potential barrier is set to L, yet
undeﬁned but of the order of the internuclear distance R. The transmission factor Tr for an electron
coming from the left of the potential hill is

Tr =

Of course, we set L = 0 when the right-hand side of the equation above is lesser than zero. By
taking a glance at eqns.
(11,17), one can guess that the eﬀective number of captures fT NT is
strongly suppressed already for R < Rm: this is exactly what found in CTMC simulations (see [7]).
In order to take an insight at what the transmission factor looks like, we plot in ﬁg. (2) ft for H -
H+ scattering.
In the same way as the laws of quantum mechanics prevent a fraction of electron to be captured even
when classically allowed, they also–through tunnelling–would make it possible for some electrons to
be captured even at internuclear distances R > Rm. However, it is easy to show that this correction
to the total capture probability is very small, and thus we will neglect it.

Let us now return to eq. (6): we have computed the ﬁrst term in the right-hand side. The second
term represents the ﬂux of electrons which have previously been captured by P and that now cross a
second time the barrier in the opposite direction, thus being re-captured by T. Notice that we have
deﬁned the probability for an electron to be bound at P as 1
W (t), thus ruling out the possibility
of ionization, which is, however, small for low-energy collisions. The deﬁnition of these terms is
straightforward, with the trivial exchange of the projectile with the target.
Eq. (6) can be formally integrated till the end of collision:

III. RESULTS-I

(see [7]). Analogously, we can recover easily the opposite limit, in which Zp >> Zt. In this case we
can neglect the return term and obtain

Equation (18) cannot be analitically integrated unless we make further simpliﬁcations. However, it
is quite easily numerically integrated by any standard mathematical software package.

Let us now apply the previous model to some test cases in order to estimate its reliability. As
a ﬁrst test bench we consider the collision between ground-state hydrogen and bare protons: the
simplest systems. Results are displayed in ﬁg. (3) together with those from a molecular approach
(MO) simulation [9], CTMC simulation [10], and direct solution of the Schr¨odinger equation [11].
The impact energy range has been chosen on the basis of the considerations that: at lower energy
the straight-line trajectory is lesser and lesser justiﬁed and other under-barrier eﬀects emerge, while
1 the adiabatic approximation fails and ionization becomes important. The main conclusion
at u
that can be drawn out from these simulations is that the OBM is able to reproduce with a rather
good accuracy the ﬁndings of the more sophisticated calculations but the symmetrization of the
capture probability must deﬁnitely be ruled out: equal sharing of the electron distribution is forced
by the symmetry of the problem in the limit u
0, while any ﬁnite impact velocity breaks through
initial conditions this symmetry and favours a net ﬂux of electrons toward the projectile. What we
have found is that the latter asymmetry dominates within the whole range of impact velocity.

We extend now simulations to multiply charged projectiles He2+ and C6+. Our results are com-
pared with those of [9], with atomic-orbital-expansions simulations by Fritsch and Lin [12], and with
some experimental results from [13] (ﬁgs. 4, 5).
For helium, re-capture by the target is already almost neglibible. It is remarkable that OBM’s and
MO’s predictions agree very well asymptotically, for u
1, while they diverge for decreasing u. This
is likely to be due to under-barrier, typical quantum mechanical processes, which, for helium, start
to be relevant already for u close to 1. Once ﬁxed the ion species, the OBM instead depends only on
the impact velocity through the 1/u behaviour due to the straight–line trajectory approximation.
The model is clearly defective at handling collisions involving highly charged ions, like carbon (see
ﬁg. 5). On the contrary, it works fairly well when applied to almost-symmetrical collisions: in ﬁg.
(6) we plot the result for collisions H+ - Na(3s), with the sodium target modelled as a hydrogenlike
atom with eﬀective charge Zt = 1 and binding energy E3s = 0.1891 a.u. The model is here compared
against experimental results from ref. [14].

IV. FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO THE OBM

We seek now to improve the performances of the model when applied to highly charged ions. Since
it overestimates the correct capture probability, we must ﬁnd a mechanism which reduces either ft
or Nt. We focus on the ﬁrst term basing upon the same guidelines followed till here: improvements
to the model are achieved by adding quantal features to it.
A main diﬀerence between the classical picture and the quantum-mechanical one is that the former
depicts the capture process as a continuous ﬂow. On the contrary, quantization rules forbid the
electronic ﬂow from one nucleus to the other unless some resonance conditions are satisﬁed: by using

It is necessary to ﬁnd a reasonable value for ∆R. For this we resort to the indeterminacy relations:
infact, ∆R
0 means that the energetic levels for the projectile are sharply deﬁned, while any
ﬁnite value for ∆R means that they are deﬁned only within an energy range ∆E. We suppose

that the usual indeterminancy relations hold: ∆E∆t

Notice that, with the above deﬁnitions, we get as a bonus also partial probabilities for capture into
well deﬁned quantum numbers: infact capture in the state m is localized around R(m), thus it is
enough to replace w (eq. 23) with the partial weights w(R, ∆R, m), each centered just around R(m),
and w(R, ∆R) =

We apply the above formalism to the hydrogen-carbon case: in ﬁg. (7) we plot the curve R(n)

electron bound to the projectile, for easiness of notation) showing that capture into quantum num-

ftw(R, ∆R), using for compar-
ison the same data as in ﬁg. (5). The agreement is now excellent (but for the data from molecular
simulations, which however stand alone, far from all the others).
In ﬁg. (9) we plot captures over the most populated quantum numbers. The dominant capture
channel is, for both models, n = 4 and cross section agree very well also in absolute value. The
sub-dominant channel instead, is not reproduced accurately: from ref. [9] it appears that it corre-
sponds to the state n = 5, while within our model we ﬁnd that the sub-dominant channel is n = 3.
Interestingly, however, the absolute values are again, very close: the captures to n = 5 are, from ref.

Finally, we want to test the eﬀectiveness of our model against more complex cases: to this purpose
we use the system He - He2+, looking for single charge exchange. The helium atom is modelled as
an eﬀective one-electron atom, with Zt = 1 and En = 24.59 eV. Again, we ﬁnd a fairly good
performance (see ﬁg. 10) although, rather oddly, it degrades as u increases.

This work was prompted by the partial dissatisfaction with work [7], where a purely classical OBM
was developed and found to be rather accurate, at the expenses of introducing two free parameters–
situation only partially cured in ref. [8]. Here we have followed the path of [6], and have shown that
decisive improvements could come by “polluting” the original fully classical picture with quantum
mechanical features (actually, no model can really be “fully classical” since it is designed to describe

phenomena that, at the end, are thought to be ruled by the laws of quantum mechanics). This
mixed description must be accurately balanced: the need of mathematical simplicity often forces
severe approximations. We have shown that, notwithstanding this, the results are promising, and
suggest that further improvements are possible with a relatively small eﬀort. One point that we
think is worth improving is the formulation of the modulation function w: we point out, infact,
that it has been deﬁned in a fairly rough way, which holds when the number of resonances (i.e.
allowed ns) is quite large, but fails in other cases. By example, it does not yield satisfactory results
when applied to H - He2+ scattering. However, even as it is now, it has been able to predict total
cross sections as well as the fraction of captures into main channels. Could it be possible to deﬁne
an accurate functional form for w in the general case, the model would be applied with success to
scattering between complex particles, thus greatly enhancing its usefulness.

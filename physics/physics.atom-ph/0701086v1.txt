The cross sections for single-electron photo-ionisation in two-electron atoms show ﬂuctuations
which decrease in amplitude when approaching the double-ionisation threshold. Based on semiclas-
sical closed orbit theory, we show that the algebraic decay of the ﬂuctuations can be characterised in
terms of a threshold law σ ∝ |E|µ as E → 0− with exponent µ obtained as a combination of stability
exponents of the triple-collision singularity. It diﬀers from Wannier’s exponent dominating double
ionisation processes. The details of the ﬂuctuations are linked to a set of inﬁnitely unstable classical
orbits starting and ending in the non-regularisable triple collision. The ﬁndings are compared with
quantum calculations for a model system, namely collinear helium.

Recent experimental progress has signiﬁcantly im-
proved the energy resolutions of highly excited two elec-
tron states below [1, 2] and above [3] the double ionisation
threshold E = 0. Near the threshold, electron-electron
correlation eﬀects become dominant which are directly
observable in total and partial cross sections, see [4, 5, 6]
for recent reviews; an example is Wannier’s celebrated
threshold law for double ionisation [7] conﬁrmed experi-
mentally in [8]. For E < 0, two-electron atoms exhibit a
rich resonance spectrum while the classical dynamics of
this three-body Coulomb problem becomes chaotic. Ap-
proaching the double ionisation threshold from below has
thus proved challenging [6] and recent experimental and
theoretical eﬀorts still only reach single-ionisation thresh-
olds IN with N ≤ 15 [1, 2, 9]. Semiclassical methods need
to address the chaotic nature of the classical dynamics
which is dominated by the complex folding patterns of
the stable/unstable manifolds of the triple collision [10].
Due to the high dimensionality of the system semiclas-
sical applications have been restricted to subsets of the
full spectrum and again small N values [6].

In this letter, we show that the ﬂuctuations in the total
cross section for single electron photo-ionisation below
the three-particle breakup energy decays algebraically
with an exponent determined by the triple collision sin-
gularity diﬀerent from Wannier’s exponent. Writing the
cross section in dipole approximation [11, 12], we obtain

σ(E) = −4π α ~ω ℑhDφi|G(E)|Dφii

(1)

where φi is the wave function of the initial state and
D = π · (r1 + r2) is the dipole operator with π, the
polarisation of the incoming photon and rj, the position
of electron j. Furthermore, G(E) is the Green function of
the system at energy E = Ei + ~ω and α = e2/~c. Note
that we work in the inﬁnite nucleus mass approximation,
that is, the position of the nucleus is ﬁxed at the origin.
By expressing the Green function semiclassically in
terms of classical trajectories [11], ﬂuctuations in the
cross section of hydrogen-like atoms in external ﬁelds

have been analysed successfully using closed orbit theory
(COT) [11, 12]. In the semiclassical limit, the support of
the wave function φi shrinks to zero relative to the size
of the system reducing the integration in (1) to an evalu-
ation of the Green function at the origin. This is strictly
valid only for potentials suﬃciently smooth at the ori-
gin, corrections due to diﬀractive scattering at the central
singularity give additional contributions often treated in
quantum defect approximation [13, 14]. The situation is
diﬀerent for two-electron atoms where the dynamics near
the origin is dominated by the non-regularisable triple
collision singularity. Closed orbit theory has been used
to analyse experimental photoabsorbtion spectra of he-
lium with and without external ﬁelds [13, 15] for highly
asymmetric states; accompanying theoretical considera-
tions treat the system in a single electron approximation
thus not considering the triple collision dynamics which
becomes important for doubly-excited resonances.

1 + r2

In the following, we will discuss a COT treatment of
two-electron atoms explicitly including the triple colli-
sion dynamics when approaching the limit E → 0−. In-
2)1/2, we ﬁx R0
troducing the hyperradius R = (r2
such that a surface Σ deﬁned as R = R0 encloses the
support of initial state φi. The surface Σ naturally leads
to a partition of the conﬁguration space into physically
distinct regions. In particular, quantum contributions to
(1) from the inner region are insensitive to the total en-
ergy. Contributions from the outer region test the full
scale of the classically allowed region of size |E|−1 and
will be responsible for the resonance structures near the
double ionisation threshold E = 0. Following Granger
and Greene [16], we write the photo-ionisation cross sec-
tion (1) in terms of local scattering matrices, that is,

the wave components going out at Σ; it thus contains
all the information about the correlated two-electron dy-
namics near the nucleus. Likewise, S↑ describes the wave
dynamics of the two-electron wave function emanating
from and returning to Σ and thus picks up long-range cor-
relation in the exterior of Σ. Furthermore, d is the atomic
dipole vector, dn(E) =< Ψ↓
n(E) be-
ing the nth linearly-independent energy-normalised so-
lution of the Schr¨odinger equation inside Σ with incom-
ing wave boundary conditions at Σ [16]. This type of
scattering formulation was independently developed in
[17] for general surfaces Σ, for a semiclassical formula-
tion, see [18]. The series expansion (3) was exploited in
[13, 14, 19] in order to include core-region scattering or
quantum defect eﬀects in COT.

n(E)|Dφi > with Ψ↓

For the wave dynamics inside Σ, the double ionisation
threshold E = 0 is irrelevant and the core-region scatter-
ing matrix S↓ as well as the dipole vector d vary smoothly
across E = 0; they can be regarded as constant for ener-
gies suﬃciently close to the threshold. The information
about the increasing number of overlapping resonances
near the threshold is thus largely contained in S↑.

Semiclassical approximations for the quantities intro-
duced above are valid in the outer-region R > R0. The
long-range scattering matrix, S↑, can thus be treated
semiclassically while d and S↓ demand a full quantum
treatment. The semiclassical representation of S↑ in po-
sition space reads [16, 17, 18]

instability of the classical dynamics near the triple col-
lision, these matrix elements become singular for triple
collision orbits (TCO) starting from or falling into the
triple collision R = 0. It is thus important here that tra-
jectories contributing to (4) start at a ﬁxed hyper-radius
R0 > 0 away from the triple collision [20].

Making use of the scaling properties of the classical

dynamics, we introduce the transformation [21]

r = ˜r/|E|; p =

|E|˜p; S = ˜S/

|E|, L = ˜L/

|E|

p

p

p

where ˜r, ˜p corresponds to coordinates and momenta at
ﬁxed energy E = −1 and L is the total angular momen-
tum. Expressing L in scaled coordinates, we have ˜L → 0
as E → 0 and can thus restrict the analysis to the three
degrees of freedom subspace ˜L = 0 (for ﬁxed L) [10].

In scaled coordinates, the inner-region shrinks accord-
ing to ˜R0 = |E|R0 → 0 for E → 0−, and the part of the

2

dynamics contributing to S↑ in (4) is formed by trajec-
tories starting and ending closer and closer to the triple
collision R = 0 as |E| ∝ ˜R0 → 0. TCOs only occur in
the so-called eZe space [10], a collinear subspace of the
full three body dynamics where the two electrons are on
opposite sides of the nucleus [21]. As ˜R0 → 0, only orbits
coming close to the eZe space can start and return to ˜Σ
and they will do so in the vicinity of a closed triple col-
lision orbit (CTCO) starting and ending exactly in the
triple collision. The dynamics in the eZe space is rela-
tively simple as it is conjectured to be fully chaotic with
a complete binary symbolic dynamics. In particular, for
every ﬁnite binary symbols string there is a CTCO, the
shortest being the so-called Wannier orbit (WO) of sym-
metric collinear electron dynamics. Furthermore TCOs
escape from or approach the triple collision at R = 0
always symmetrically along the r1 = r2 axis in the eZe
space, that is, along the WO [22]. This universality will
be exploited below when treating the energy-dependence
of M12 in (4).

Returning to the cross-section (2), we write σ = σ0 +
σf l, where we identify the smooth contribution σ0 with
the leading term in the series expansion (3). The main
contribution to the ﬂuctuating part of the cross section
σf l is contained in S↑ which in semiclassical approxima-
tion (4) can be expressed in terms of orbits returning to
k
˜Σ once; multiple traversals of ˜Σ represented by
with k ≥ 2 will give sub-leading contributions in the semi-
(cid:1)
classical limit E → 0− due to the unstable dynamics near
the triple collision. Furthermore, swarms of trajectories
starting on ˜Σ and returning to ˜Σ will do so close to the
eZe subspace and thus in the neighbourhood of a CTCO
with actions and amplitudes approaching those of the
CTCO trajectory as ˜R0 → 0. The ﬂuctuating part can
thus in leading order be written in the form

and z = 1/~
In (5), the sum is taken over all
CTCO’s j starting and ending at ˜Σ. Note that the sta-
bility ˜M12( ˜R0) in scaled coordinates depends on energy
implicitly through the scaled radius ˜R0(E) = |E|R0.
As E → 0−, ˜M12 picks up additional contributions of
parts of the CTCO closer and closer to the triple col-
lision. Asymptotically, all CTCOs approach the triple
collision along the WO and the contributions to M12 be-
come orbit-independent. The R-dependence for the Mon-
odromy matrix of the WO can for small ˜R be obtained
analytically [23] leading to

| ˜M12( ˜R0)| ∝ | ˜R0|−2µ+9/2 for ˜R0 → 0

Thus, in unscaled coordinates, M12 in (6) diverges which
is a direct consequence of the non-regularisability of the
triple collision acting as an inﬁnitely unstable point in
phase space; details will be presented in [23]. The expo-
nent µ in (8) is universal for all CTCOs and consists of
two components: µeZe is related to the linearised dynam-
ics in the eZe space and µwr picks up contributions from
two equivalent expanding degrees of freedom orthogonal
to the eZe space in the so-called Wannier ridge (WR).
The latter is the invariant subspace of symmetric elec-
tron dynamics with |r1| = |r2| at all times [21]. The ﬂuc-
tuations in the photo-ionisation cross section thus vanish
in amplitude as E → 0− according to

σf l(E) ∝ |E|µ ℜ

where the rescaled amplitudes aj = |E|−µAj depend only
weakly on E. These amplitudes contain contributions
from the linearised dynamics along the orbit far from Σ
as well as information about the inner quantum region
R < R0 via the dipole vector d and the core-region scat-
tering matrix S↓. Furthermore, multiple traversals of Σ
contained in
with k ≥ 2 in (3) approach the
triple collision k times from the semiclassical side and
will thus contribute at lower order with weights scaling
at least as Akj ∼ |E|kµ. The exponent µ in (8) is diﬀerent
from Wannier’s exponent µw with

One obtains, for example, µ = 1.30589... compared to
µw = 1.05589... for helium; the WR contributes to the
decay for Z > 9/4 when µwr is real.

The exponent µ can be interpreted in terms of stabil-
ity exponents of the triple collision singularity. Using an
appropriate scaling of space and time by, for example,
employing McGehee’s technique [22], the dynamics near
the singularity is dominated by two unstable ﬁxed points
in scaled phase space, the double escape point (DEP) and
the triple collision point (TCP). In unscaled coordinates,
these ﬁxed points correspond to the WO at energy E = 0,
that is, the DEP is the trajectory of symmetric double es-
cape while the TCP corresponds to the symmetric triple
collision and is the time reversed of the DEP. The triple
collision itself can be mapped onto the classical dynam-
ics at E = 0; likewise, ˜R0 = |E|R0 acts as a parameter
measuring the closeness to the E = 0 manifold which
contains the ﬁxed points, see [10, 22]. Most classical tra-
jectories emerging from ˜Σ in the vicinity of the triple
collision ˜R = 0 will lead to immediate ionisation of one
electron carrying away a larger amount of kinetic energy.

Only a fraction of orbits starting on ˜Σ near the WO will
enter a chaotic scattering region; the WO at E < 0 thus
acts as an unstable direction of the DEP, U wo
D , with a
stability exponent λwo
UD . From there, they can return to
the triple collision region and thus approach the surface
˜Σ again along the WO, that is, along the stable direction
Swo
T . The transition from the DEP into the chaotic scat-
tering region and from this scattering region to the TCP
is limited by the least stable eigendirections of the ﬁxed
points in each of the invariant subspaces (eZe or WR)
perpendicular to the WO.

Trajectories leaving ˜Σ along the WO in the eZe space
diverge from the WO along an unstable direction U eZe
with a stability exponent λeZe
UD . Competition of the insta-
bility in U wo
D determines the fraction
∆D
eZe of orbits entering the chaotic scattering region. By
using methods as in [10, 24], one ﬁnds that

with exponent equal to Wannier’s exponent (10). For the
cross section (1), information about the phase space re-
gion returning from the chaotic scattering region to the
surface ˜Σ along the WO is also needed. While approach-
ing ˜Σ, these orbits are deﬂected away from the triple
collision along an unstable direction U eZe
of the TCP
ﬁxed point. The fraction of orbits reaching the surface ˜Σ
among those leaving the chaotic scattering region scales
thus as in (11) now with exponent λeZe

mechanisms apply for the WR dynamics.

The fraction ∆ of two-electron trajectories making the
transition from ˜Σ back to ˜Σ can thus in the limit E → 0−
be estimated in terms of the stability exponents of the
ﬁxed points, also referred to as Siegel exponents [24] in
celestial mechanics. One obtains ∆ ∝ ˜R2µ
0 with µ as in
(8) which can be written as

for the actual values of the stability exponents λ, see
[7, 10]. The mean amplitude of the ﬂuctuations in the
quantum signal is thus asymptotically related to the frac-
tion of phase space volume starting and ending at ˜R0.

A numerical study of the full three-body quantum
problem is still out of reach for energies E < IN with
N ∼ 15 [1, 9]; we therefore chose a model system, namely
eZe collinear helium ﬁrst studied quantum mechanically
in [25]. We calculated the cross section (1) directly in a
large set of basis functions using the method of complex
rotation and obtained a converged signal for N ∼ 55.
Semiclassically, we consider now the dynamics in the eZe
space alone, which contains all the important parts re-
garding the algebraic decay in the ﬂuctuations. The
number of basis functions used are scaled with energy
to cover a ﬁxed scaled region in ˜R containing CTCOs
with ˜S/2π ≤ 20. Adopting the basis functions used by

space are shown for the ﬁrst 4 peaks. Inset: σf l for N ≤ 52.

P¨uttner et al [1] leading to a strongly banded Hamilto-
nian matrix, it is possible to increase the basis size to 106.
Starting with an odd initial state φi, we obtain the cross
section for the even parity eZe spectrum; its ﬂuctuating
part after numerically subtracting a smooth background
is shown in Fig. 1. The numerical value of the exponent
µ is determined by rescaling the signal according to

F (z) = |E|−µσf l(z)/~ω

(12)

and testing the stationarity of the Fourier transform of

4

F (z) in diﬀerent energy windows [23]. The best value
thus obtained is µ = 1.306±0.035 in good agreement with
the theoretical prediction (8). (Note that the real parts of
the exponents for 3-dim. helium and for eZe helium coin-
cide as ℜµwr = 0). Furthermore, the peaks in the Fourier
transform can be associated one-by-one with CTCO’s in
the eZe system, see Fig. 1. We do not observe peaks as-
sociated with the concatenation of diﬀerent CTCO’s or
repetitions of single CTCO’s. This is consistent with the
expected suppression of orbit contributions traversing Σ
more than once as discussed earlier. Furthermore, we cal-
culated the geometrical contribution to the coeﬃcients aj
in (9) directly from the matrix-elements M12 by scaling
out the leading order divergence; a clear correlation with
the peak heights can be seen in Fig. 1. Quantum contri-
butions from the core region are thus indeed roughly the
same for all CTCOs.

In conclusion, we show that the ﬂuctuations in the to-
tal photo-ionisation cross section below the double ion-
isation threshold follow an algebraic law with a novel
exponent which can be written in terms of stability ex-
ponents of the triple collision. Our ﬁndings are veriﬁed
numerically for a collinear model systems; we further-
more predict that the algebraic decay law is valid for
the physically relevant 3 dimensional cases with an addi-
tional contribution from the WR dynamics for Z > 9/4.
Our ﬁndings will provide new impetus for experimental-
ists and theoreticians alike to study highly doubly excited
states in two-electron atoms.

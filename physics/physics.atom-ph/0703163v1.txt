We explore consequences of a hypothetical diﬀerence between active charges, which generate
electric ﬁelds, and passive charges, which respond to them. A confrontation to experiments using
atoms, molecules, or macroscopic matter yields limits on their fractional diﬀerence at levels down to
−21, which at the same time corresponds to an experimental conﬁrmation of Newtons third law.

INTRODUCTION

A. Model

In electrodynamics, one may distinguish between two
types of charge: The active charge qa is the source of the
electric ﬁeld,

whereas the passive charge qp reacts to it:

∇ · E = 4πqaδ(x) ,

m¨x = qpE .

(1)

(2)

Here, m is the inertial mass and x the position of the
particle. In gravitational physics, a hypothetical diﬀer-
ence between active and passive gravitational mass has
been considered and confronted with laboratory and as-
trophysical observations. However, as yet nothing similar
has been done for the electric and magnetic analogue, in
spite of a long history of precision experiments that in-
cludes tests of the 1/r Coulomb potential, searches for an
electrostatic ﬁfth force [1, 2], the photon mass [3], and
violations of Lorentz invariance [4, 5]. Current Maxwell
theory tacitly assumes the equality of passive and active
charges and is fundamental to a broad range of theoreti-
cal and experimental physics; any inequality would thus
have serious consequences throughout science, from the
standard model of particle physics to practical applica-
tions like precision metrology. — Here, we show that
limits as low as 10−21e can be derived for protons and
electrons by introducing the concepts of active and pas-
sive neutrality. Furthermore, we identify signatures for
such a diﬀerence in atomic spectroscopy. We extend the
analysis to active and passive magnetic moments and ﬁnd
corresponding limits from hyperﬁne spectroscopy. Our
limits appear important in the context of recent quan-
tum gravity scenarios, where all sorts of symmetries (like
Lorentz and CPT invariance or the equivalence principle)
are expected to be violated [4].

The dynamics of two particles located at x1,2 in their

mutual electric ﬁelds are described by the equations

m1 ¨x1 = q1pq2a

m2 ¨x2 = q2pq1a

x2 − x1
|x2 − x1|3 + q1pE(x1) ,
x1 − x2
|x1 − x2|3 + q2pE(x2) ,

(3)

where E denotes a homogenous external electric ﬁeld,
and q1p, q1a, q2p, q2a are the respective passive and active
charges. (This non-relativistic description will be suﬃ-
cient for our purpose, which is to identify stringent con-
straints on any inequality of active and passive charges
from experiments. In the light of these limits, it is not
necessary to consider the relativistic equations of mo-
tion.) For the equation of motion of the center of mass
X, we ﬁnd

¨X =

q1pq2p
M

C21

x
|x|3 +

1
M

(q1p + q2p) E

(4)

where M = m1 + m2, x is the relative coordinate, and

C21 =

q2a
q2p

−

q1a
q1p

.

(5)

Thus, if active and passive charges are diﬀerent, the cen-
ter of mass shows a self–acceleration along the direction
of x, in addition to the acceleration caused by the ex-
ternal ﬁeld E. This can be interpreted as a violation of
Newton’s third law actio equals reactio for electric forces.
C21 = 0 means that the ratio between the active and pas-
sive charge is the same for both particles. If this ratio is
the same for all particles, then it can be absorbed into a
redeﬁnition of the electric charges and has no observable
consequences. The dynamics of the relative coordinate is
given by

¨x = −

and mred is the reduced mass. In the standard frame-
work, D21 = 1. Bound solutions of the equation of mo-
tion (6) are ellipses; choosing suitable coordinates, they
can be normal to the z−axis. The simplest case is cir-
cular motion, where x(t) = x0(cos(ωt), sin(ωt), 0). The
center of mass oscillates at a frequency ω, which is related
to the energy of the system. The acceleration of the cen-
ter of mass vanishes on average, h ¨Xi = 0. Thus, it is
not necessarily observable. These considerations extend
to many particle systems, e.g., to atoms having many
electrons.

Of course, a large C21 would likely be observed rou-
tinely in chemistry and physics. For example, the Born-
Mayer model predicts the bond energy of ionic crystals
to 1-10% accuracy, so C21 & 1% could be noticed; also a
change of bond lengths would result [6] and be detectable
at this level. The limit to the accuracy is by the complex
nature of the crystals. However, the experiments to be
discussed below can provide sensitivity up to 19 orders
of magnitude better.

B. Active and passive mass

The analogous case of active and passive masses has
ﬁrst been discussed by Bondi [7]: The equations of mo-
tion for a gravitationally bound two body system have
the same structure as for electric bound charges:

¨x1 = G

¨x2 = G

m1pm2a
m1
m2pm1a
m2

x2 − x1
|x2 − x1|3 ,
x1 − x2
|x1 − x2|3 ,

(8)

where the indices p and a denote the passive and active
gravitational mass, respectively, and G is the gravita-
tional constant. (As throughout, m without these indices
denotes the inertial mass.) Thus, an inequality of active
and passive masses results in a self–acceleration of the
center of mass if ¯C21 = (m2a/m2p) − (m1a/m1p) 6= 0,
which again can be interpreted as violation of Newton’s
third law for gravitational forces. A limit has been de-
rived by lunar laser ranging: that no self–acceleration of
the moon has been observed, yields a limit of | ¯CAl−Fe| ≤
7 · 10−13 [8]. The dynamics of the relative coordinate

has been probed in a laboratory experiment by Kreuzer
[9] with the result | ¯C21| ≤ 5·10−5. Note that these exper-
iments are purely gravitational ones. For the astrophys-
ical observations, this is because astronomical bodies do
not carry active electric charges. (Otherwise, they would
attract passively charged particles. If these carry active
charges of the same sign, this will eventually neutralize
the active charge.) In laboratory experiments, electric
neutrality is ensured by grounding. These experiments

2

thus conﬁrm the equality of active and passive mass, in-
dependent of any inequality between active and passive
electric charge.

Owing to the extreme relative weakness of the grav-
itational force compared to the electrical one, it would
take a huge violation of the equality of active and pas-
sive mass to mimic a signal for an inequality of active
and passive charge. For example, the gravitational force
between the electron and the proton in a hydrogen atom
is ∼ 10−39 times the electrical one. Thus, to mimic an
electrical C21 ∼ 10−20 in the hydrogen spectroscopy ex-
periments discussed later, it would take a gravitational
¯C21 ∼ 10+19. A ¯C21 of this magnitude is clearly ruled
out. Other experiments discussed by us are based on
measuring the active charge of a macroscopic number of
atoms by use of an electrometer. The electrometer is
based on the Coulomb force caused by the charge to be
measured on a number of electrons. Again, the gravi-
tational interaction with these electrons is much weaker
than the electrical and it would take a huge gravitational
¯C21 to mimic an electrical C21. Because of this we can
neglect any inequality of gravitational mass (as well as
standard gravitational eﬀects) in the remainder of this
paper. The limits we will ﬁnd are thus independent of
an inequality of active and passive mass.

Moreover, since the acceleration of charges is propor-
tional to qp/m (where m is the inertial mass), one might
ask whether measurements may be insensitive to changes
in the passive charge that are accompanied by propor-
tional changes in the inertial mass. This question is best
answered by an explicit example. We shall do so in sec-
tion III.

C. Comparison of the gravitational and electrical
case

The electric case diﬀers from the gravitational one in
three important ways: (i) In the gravitational case, the
weak Equivalence Principle m = mp implies that paths
of particles depend on the active gravitational mass only.
(ii) Since the timescale of electric phenomena is much
shorter than that of gravitational ones, the motion of
the center of mass cannot be monitored. This kind of
test is therefore not at our disposal.
(iii) Contrary to
the gravitational case, electric charges can have diﬀerent
signs. Therefore, we can deﬁne active neutrality q1a +
q2a = 0 as well as passive neutrality q1p + q2p = 0. This
allows us to ﬁnd alternative tests of the equality of active
and passive charges: An actively neutral system may not
be passively neutral and vice versa. Both deﬁnitions of
neutrality are compatible, but a system can be actively
and passively neutral if and only if C21 = 0. Therefore, a
self–acceleration of the center of mass occurs only if the
system possesses a nonzero total active or passive charge.

II. EXPERIMENTS WITH MACROSCOPIC
MATTER

In order to interpret tests of the neutrality of atoms
and molecules as tests of the equality of active and pas-
sive charge, we study compound particles that are ac-

trality, there will be no acceleration due to the external
ﬁeld E and C21 reduces to (q2a + q1a)/q2p. The diﬀer-
ence between active and passive charges is now related
to the active neutrality of the composed system: a pas-
sively neutral system may still generate an electric ﬁeld
according to

ternal electric ﬁeld feels a force

(11)

Thus, we can distinguish two types of tests of neutrality:
(i) Tests of active neutrality, which measure the electric
monopole ﬁeld created by a passively neutral system, and
(ii) tests of passive neutrality, which measure the force
imposed by an external ﬁeld onto an actively neutral sys-
tem.

A review of tests of the neutrality of atoms can be
found in [10]. One type of experiments, gas eﬄux ex-
periments, tests the active neutrality. They are based on
observing the charge of a metallic container during an
in- or outﬂow of gas or liquid. [The charge measurement
is based on the electric ﬁeld caused by the charge and is
therefore sensitive to active charge only. This also applies
to the modern electrometers that use ﬁeld-eﬀect transis-
tors.] With each of N atoms or molecules containing a
number np of protons and electrons and nn neutrons, the
charge N [np(qe,a + qp,a) + nnqn,a] is measured. The in-
dices e, p, and n denote the electron, the proton, and the
neutron. An interesting modern variant [11] uses super-
ﬂuid He as a medium.

The passive neutrality has been tested by a variety of
methods, see Ref. [10] for details: (i) Levitation experi-
ments [12] follow the famous experiment by Millikan for
the measurement of the electric charge of atoms. (ii) In
acoustic resonator experiments [13], one applies an al-
ternating electric ﬁeld within an acoustic resonator and
listens for the sound that would result due to a passively
charged medium. (iii) Atom [14] or neutron [15] beam
experiments measure the deﬂection of a beam of atoms
or neutrons which transverses an electric ﬁeld.

The limits assembled in Tab.

I are at levels down
to 10−21 elementary charges for the active and passive
charge of various combinations of electrons, protons, and
neutrons. If we assume that there are no cancellations,
we can thus conclude that |Cpe| ≤ 10−21, which can be

III. SPECTROSCOPY

We now study the shift of atomic transition frequen-
cies due to an inequality of active and passive charges.
Although the center of mass motion of the two–particle
system cannot be quantized in general, the relative mo-
tion can. The Hamiltonian is

H =

Therefore, a comparison of the energy levels in atoms
having diﬀerent nuclear mass yields a test of the equality
of active and passive charges. Since the accuracy is inﬂu-
enced by the accuracy of the theoretical prediction of the
transition frequencies, comparison of simple atoms gives
the most accurate results. Let us thus compare hydro-
gen H and ionized helium He+: For H, we have q1 = qp,
q2 = qe, and M ≈ mp; for He+, q1 = 2qp and q2 = qe, and
M ≈ 4mp. For the ratio of the transition frequencies, we
thus ﬁnd

where we have neglected terms of the order (me/mp)2.
The 1S1/2-2S1/2 transition in hydrogen has been mea-
sured to a precision of 1.9 × 10−14 [19]; however, the the-
oretical prediction of the Lamb shift has an error bar of
6.9 × 10−13, in part due to the uncertainty in the charge
radius of the proton. See Appendix A of Ref. [20]. Since
He+ ions can be laser cooled [21], an even higher preci-
sion is expected for them [22]. Also the theoretical uncer-
tainty for He+ can be lower since the properties of the He

nucleus are better known. If no discrepancy like Eq. (14)
between H and He+ at 7 × 10−13 would be found, we
could deduce a limit of |C21| ≤ 8.3 × 10−10.

The accuracy of this limit is less than the one of
the frequencies by the nucleus to electron mass ratio
of hydrogen mp/me. Thus, it is interesting to consider
positronium, where the mass ratio is unity. Positronium’s
1 3S1 − 2 3S1 frequency is known to 2.6 × 10−9 [23]. The
deviation from the theoretical prediction is ∼ 1.3σ ([26],
Fig. 3), but we consider this insigniﬁcant. Comparison to
hydrogen thus yields a limit on α2
12(H) ≈ 1 + Cee+,
where we neglect a term which is suppressed by me/mp.
Thus, we obtain |Cee+ | ≤ 2.6 × 10−9 (The Lamb shift in
positronium can be predicted to suﬃcient accuracy [20]).
These limits are not as precise as the ones derived from
bulk matter experiments, which gain sensitivity from the
macroscopic number of particles. However, they are par-
ticularly clean: The physics of light atoms is known in
detail to the same precision as the limit derived.

ee+ /α2

The explicit form of the experimental signature Eq.
(14) also makes clear that the measurement is not insen-
sitive to changes in the passive charge even if it is accom-
panied by changes in the inertial masses. These masses
solely enter the factor me/mp that sets the sensitivity of
the experiment to C21. However, C21 6= 0 will always
be detected, regardless of small variations in this factor.
The fundamental reason for this is that the experiment is
based on comparing two atoms that have diﬀerent nuclei
and thus diﬀerent charge to mass ratios.

IV. MAGNETIC MOMENTS

Since moving charges create magnetic ﬁelds and mag-
netic ﬁelds act on moving charges, one may extend the
above analysis to the question of the equality of active
and passive magnetic moments. In analogy to the above
considerations, we ﬁrst calculate the force between two
magnetic moments

m2 ¨x2 = ∇2

(15)

where

Bj(xk) =

3((xk − xj) · µja)(xk − xj) − µja|xk − xj|2
|xk − xj|5

.

(16)
In a classical picture, the magnetic moments can be con-
sidered as being created by a current loop and the direc-
tion of the magnetic moment is given by the orientation
of the loop. Therefore, a diﬀerence between active and
passive magnetic moments is a diﬀerence between their
magnitudes only, which are related to the charges making
µ1,2,
up the current. Thus, we assume µ1,2a,p = µ1,2a,p
µ1,2 are unit vectors indicating the direction of the

For diﬀerent ratios of active and passive magnetic mo-
ments, the center of mass will show self–acceleration.
The equations of the torque describe the orientation of
˙µ1p = −B2(x1) × µ1p, and
the magnetic moments only:
˙µ2p = −B1(x2) × µ2p. This gives rise to an additional
spin–orbit coupling. We will not consider this.

where the δ–function describes the contribution from the

To obtain experimental limits, we compare the hyper-
b
ﬁne splitting of atoms having diﬀerent nuclei. The hy-
perﬁne splitting of muonium has been measured to an
accuracy of 1.1 × 10−8 [24]. As summarized in [25], it
is compatible with the theoretical prediction, which has
an uncertainty of 1.2 × 10−7. For positronium, two pre-
cision measurements of the 1S hyperﬁne splitting have
been reported by Mills et al. [27], and Ritter at al. [28].
They agree within the experimental error. However, they
deviate by -6.3(2.9) MHz and -4.7(1.7) MHz, respectively,
from the theoretical prediction of 203.3917(6) GHz [26].
In our framework, this diﬀerence may be modelled by
a diﬀerence of passive and active magnetic moments of
Cee+ = −1.7(7) × 10−5 for the Mills et al. measurement
Cee+ = −1.3(4) × 10−5 for Ritter et al.. It is worth
and
e
noting that such a discrepancy between theory and ex-
periment exist for this 1S hyperﬁne splitting only. All
other spectroscopical quantities discussed in [26], which
are approximately independent of a diﬀerence in active
and passive magnetic moments, agree to their theoretical

e

prediction (e.g., the 1S-2S interval already used above to
ﬁnd a limit on Cee+ and the ﬁne structure of four diﬀerent
transitions).

On the other hand, the discrepancy between theory
and experiment could be due to systematic inﬂuences in
the experiments or an incomplete theoretical understand-
ing of positronium (the latter point of view is expressed
in [26]). Even two diﬀerent experiments can be inﬂu-
enced by the same systematic eﬀects if the measurement
principle is similar or in part similar. For example, the
line shape of positronium is still being investigated [? ].
This would make it interesting to ﬁnd alternative mea-
surements, for example from the hyperﬁne structure of
non-leptonic atoms. An overview for hydrogen, deu-
terium, tritium and the 3He ion can be found in [25].
Precise experiments (with error bars in the 10−12 range)
do exist, but unfortunately there are rather large dis-
crepancies to the theory. These are attributed to the
uncertainty of the nuclear contributions [25]. Moreover,
the high nucleus to electron mass ratio suppresses the in-
ﬂuence of
C12 on the hyperﬁne splitting of non-leptonic
atoms. For example, hydrogen and tritium show the
lowest discrepancy between theory and experiment of -
33ppm and -38ppm, respectively. We take the diﬀer-
ence of 5 ppm as a signal for active and passive mag-
netic moments, and the geometric sum of 50 ppm of the
discrepancies as an estimate of the error. This gives
C21(H)− 1
|
×(5±50)ppm = 0.005±0.045.

This is not suitable for ruling out the signiﬁcant value
e
from positronium and muonium spectroscopy.

To sum up, at the present state of theory and exper-
iment we have to regard the possibility of a diﬀerence
of theory and experiment as a hypothesis that is prob-
ably wrong, though it is supported by two independent
experiments. However, it would be interesting to check
it against other systems. Unfortunately, the hyperﬁne
structure of non-leptonic atoms depicts even larger the-
oretical uncertainties.

V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

In summary, we have introduced the concept of ac-
tive and passive electric charges and magnetic moments,
which in standard electrodynamics are assumed to be
equal. The best limits (of the order of 10−21 for Cpe
come from experiments testing the neutrality of macro-
scopic matter, which gain sensitivity from a large num-
ber of particles. Spectroscopy of hydrogen and positron-

5

ium provides |Cee+ | ≤ 2.6 × 10−9. These limits can also
be interpreted as experimental veriﬁcations of Newton’s
third law for electric forces at the 10−21 level. For mag-
netic moments, comparison of the hyperﬁne structure of
positronium and muonium suggests a diﬀerence of active
and passive of | ˜Cee+ | ≤ −1.4 × 10−5 that is signiﬁcant
at the 3σ level. However, at the present state of theory
and experiment, this is more likely an artifact, even if
two independent experiments agree. The best limit from
non-leptonic atoms (hydrogen and tritium) is at the 5%
level of accuracy.

The relativistic quantum theory of electrodynamics is
quantum electrodynamics (QED), and one may ask how
the question of active and passive charges can be formu-
lated in this context. The most straightforward way to
do so starts at the level of the ﬁeld equations: We use the
passive charge in the Dirac equation for an electron with
minimal coupling to the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The ac-
tive charge enters the source term in the inhomogenous
Maxwell equation. The non-relativistic Pauli equation
and the classical limit can then be found in the usual
way, as described in textbooks. As a result, this rela-
tivistic quantum description contains our above classical
results. Further experimental signatures on a diﬀerence
of active and passive charges might be sought within such
a model. This might be possible, for example, by com-
paring the value of the ﬁne-structure constant obtained
from the measurement of the electron’s anomalous mag-
netic moment g − 2 = α/(2π) + . . . (to 7 × 10−10 accu-
racy [29]), to other measurements of α. However, even
without a QED version of our question, we were able to
answer it in terms of experimental limits, some of them
very stringent.

The C and ˜C coeﬃcients for most particle combina-
tions are ∼ 12 orders of magnitude less stringent than Cpe
and Cne. Thus, it might be interesting to seek further
experimental limits. For example, certain selection rules
in spectroscopy, that are normally imposed by symmetry
arguments, might be broken. New versions of the macro-
scopic matter experiments could simultaneously measure
the active and passive charge in order to suppress some
of the systematic eﬀects.

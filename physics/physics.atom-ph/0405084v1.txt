The Physics of Atom–Surface Interactions
Carsten Henkel
Institut f ¨ur Physik, Universit¨at Potsdam, Germany

Advanced School, Les Houches May 2004

In this lecture, an overview on interactions between atoms and surfaces is
given that are mediated by the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The emphasis is on dis-
persion (or van der Waals) forces and transitions induced by thermal ﬂuctu-
ations in the near ﬁeld of a surface. Applications with cold atoms held in
microscopic traps near surfaces, as outlined in the lecture by J. Schmiedmayer,
provide the experimental background for this theory lecture.

We do not cover the chemical physics aspects that are relevant at distances
comparable to the atomic scale. Phenomena like adsorption and diffusion on
surfaces, or atomic beam diffraction from crystalline surfaces, are left to the
lectures by J. Frenken and H. Lezec.

1 Van der Waals Forces

1.1 Conventional viewpoint

The Van der Waals force derives from the energy shift an atomic ground state
experiences in front of a surface. This shift is computed in second order per-
turbation theory, coupling the atom to the mode continuum of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld. The following section (in small characters like these) is taken from
the lecture notes “Theoretical Quantum Optics I”, held at Universit¨at Pots-
dam (Germany) winter semester 2003/04. The complete notes are on line at
www.quantum.physik.uni-potsdam.de.

1.1.1 Single-mode vacuum shift

Let us start with a single mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. We have seen previously
that the ground state
of the atom+ﬁeld system is not affected by the interaction.
This is actually only true in the rotating wave approximation. When we include the
nonresonant terms1,

they do affect the ground state, since

Hnr = ¯hg(σ+a† + σ−a)

This shift is very small compared to those due to the resonant interaction because here
the “detuning” ωA + ω is large (the transition can only happen “virtually” because it
violates energy conservation).

Nevertheless, we learn that the atom-ﬁeld interaction does displace the absolute
ground state of the system, even for a single mode. The Lamb shift is the generalisa-
tion of this result for the full, multi-mode electromagnetic ﬁeld.

1.1.2 Lamb shift, a ﬁrst glimpse

The calculation of the Lamb shift is a basic example of the different inﬁnities that occur
in quantum electrodynamics. We only give a ﬁrst idea of the calculation, without

It is beyond the scope of this lecture to give a more detailed account of the Lamb

shift calculation.

1.1.3 Van der Waals and Casimir-Polder forces

The previous calculation, as sick as it is, does give a result for the modiﬁcation of
the Lamb shift due to boundary conditions imposed on the electromagnetic ﬁeld by
macroscopic bodies. Let us focus on the simple case that our two-level atom is placed
at a distance z from a perfectly reﬂecting mirror. All we have to change in the calcula-
tion are the mode functions, and we shall use

fkµ(x) = √2 sin(kzz) exp[i(kxx + kyy)].

(We are actually cheating with the polarisation vectors to simplify things.) The factor
√2 comes from the fact that we use a unitary transformation2 of the plane waves
e±ikzz. We have to change the angular integration (3) because now the z-axis plays a
privileged role. We can expand the dipole moment in cartesian components and get
(θ is now the angle between k and the z-axis):

Note that the integrals over the mixed terms involve cos ϕ, sin ϕ, or cos ϕ sin ϕ whose
average over one period vanishes. In terms of the components dk = dz and d⊥ of the

Apparently, we get an expression with different powers of 1/z.

Let us focus ﬁrst on the short-distance limit and consider only the “most diverg-

ing” term

1/z3. It involves the integral

I3(z) =

where we have put kA = ωA/c. We use a trick in the complex plane to perform the
integration: write sin 2kz as the imaginary part of e2ikz and deform the integration
path in the complex plane from the positive real axis to the positive imaginary axis.
This works because the exponential e2ikz vanishes at inﬁnity, and the integrand has no
pole in the upper left quadrant. Using the integration variable k = iκ on the imaginary
axis, we ﬁnd

I3(z) = Im

We approximate this integral by noticing that it is the product of two decaying

we can also evaluate the integral (7). Now the exponential has the fastest decay, and

1.1.4 Summary

An atom in its ground state close to a planar surface feels an attractive po-
tential that scales like 1/z3 (van der Waals potential). This applies to distances
much shorter than the wavelength λA of the strongest electric dipole transition
starting from the ground state. The coefﬁcient depends on the squared dipole
moment d2 of the atom, more precisely its expectation value in the ground
λA, a power law 1/z4 is found (Casimir-Polder
state. At large distances z
potential). The coefﬁcient depends on d2/ωA, and this quantity is proportional
to the atom’s static polarizability α(0). More details on this calculation can be
found, for example, in the textbook by Craig and Thirunamachandran [?] and
the 1990 Les Houches lecture by Haroche [?].

For later reference, we quote here the result for the polarizability of the
atomic ground state. This formula can be found by evaluating to lowest order
in an applied electric ﬁeld (frequency ω) the average dipole induced moment.

1.2 Role of ﬁeld ﬂuctuations

We now present an alternative viewpoint on the van der Waals force. Its ad-
vantage is that the role of ﬁeld ﬂuctuations is made explicit. Both vacuum and
thermal ﬂuctuations contribute at ﬁnite temperature. We develop a formalism
that treats both in a uniﬁed way. At zero temperature, the standard van der
Waals force is recovered. A thermal correction appears in the near ﬁeld of a
‘hot’ surface.

The following section is adapted from the paper “Radiation forces on small
particles in thermal near ﬁelds” by C. Henkel, K. Joulain, J.-P. Mulet, and J.-J.
Greffet [J. Opt. A: Pure Appl. Opt. 4 (2002) S109].

1.2.1 Radiation force

We consider a model system made from a dielectric half-space and a small (sub-
wavelength) “test particle” in vacuum above. Both objects are possibly at ﬁnite tem-
perature and radiate electromagnetic ﬁelds whose sources are thermal current ﬂuctu-
ations. Using the ﬂuctuation electrodynamics framework of Lifshitz [?], the spectral
density of these currents is related to the imaginary part of the dielectric function (for
the half-space) or of the polarizability (for the particle).

We are interested in the force exerted by the radiation on the test particle. This
force is actually both a time-average over the rapid ﬂuctuations of the thermal ﬁeld
and an average over a statistical ensemble for the ﬁeld. For particles with a subwave-
length size, the force is given by [?]

F(r) =

di(t)

Ei(r, t)
i

∇

Xi=x,y,zh

(11)

where d(t) is the dipole moment of the particle and E(r, t) the total electric ﬁeld at the
particle’s position. The latter contains the ﬁelds generated by the thermal substrate

7

and by the particle’s dipole moment, as well as the blackbody ﬁeld in the vacuum
half-space. The expression (11) combines both the Coulomb force (corresponding to
E) and the Lorentz force (involving the magnetic ﬁeld), see
the potential energy
[?]. As a simple derivation, we note that the force operator can be deﬁned in terms the
Heisenberg equation for the momentum operator

(13)

where we have used the fact that the atomic Hamiltonian is independent of the atomic
center-of-mass position. Using the electric dipole interaction, one gets (11).

In our case, both the dipole moment and the electric ﬁeld are ﬂuctuating quantities.

The force may therefore be written as a sum of two terms

where the ﬁrst describes the (spontaneous and thermal) ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld that
correlate with the corresponding induced dipole, while the second involves dipole
ﬂuctuations and the ﬁeld they induce. There is no term involving ﬂuctuations of both
the dipole and the ﬁeld: these are not correlated, since they originate from different
physical systems. More precisely, to lowest order in perturbation theory, we can take
the ﬂuctuations in (13) to be those of the non-coupled atom+ﬁeld system, these being
obviously uncorrelated.

1.2.2 Induced ﬂuctuations

The dipole induced by the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations is given by the particle’s polarizability:

d(ind)(ω) = α(ω)E(r; ω)

(14)

where we switched to frequency Fourier transforms and assumed an isotropic polar-
izability. Note also that E(ω; r) is the total electric ﬁeld at the dipole’s location. If we
work at lowest order in the polarizability, we can identify this ﬁeld with the ﬂuctuat-
ing ﬁeld E(ﬂ)(r; ω) and ignore the scattering of this ﬁeld by the particle. Otherwise, we
could work with a “dressed” polarizability. Note however that the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld is
not simply a collection of plane waves, but takes into account their scattering from the
substrate.

The ﬁeld induced by the dipole ﬂuctuations is given by the electromagnetic Green

tensor:

E(ind)(x; ω) =

(x, r; ω)

d(ω),

(15)

G
where the variables x and r represent the observation and source point, respectively.
To lowest order, we can identify the total dipole in (15) with its ﬂuctuating component,
as we did before for the ﬁeld.

ei(ω−ω′)t

(16)

where the frequency integrals run over both positive and negative frequencies. With-
out loss of generality, we have written the frequency integral for B(t) in terms of the
conjugate operator B†[ω]. This is possible because in (13), both A(t) and B(t) are real
(hermitian) operators.

1.2.3 Fluctuation spectra

Dipole. The dipole ﬂuctuations of the particle are characterized by a spectral den-
sity given by the ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem. This assumes the particle to be at
thermal equilibrium (temperature T2/kB) and gives [?, ?]

particular, at T2 = 0, the dipole “ﬂuctuates only at negative frequencies” which reﬂects
the existence of the ground state (ﬂuctuations can only connect to higher-lying states).
We identify these ﬂuctuations with spontaneous ﬂuctuations. Thermal ﬂuctuations
are proportional to ¯n and are the same for positive and negative frequencies (as they
should for classical noise spectra).

1.2.4 Resulting force

Collecting the different contributions to the force, we show that the “vacuum” ﬂuctu-
ations of both particle and substrate conspire to give the standard van der Waals–
Casimir–Polder–London force. The thermal ﬂuctuations give a correction that we
evaluate in the limit of a particle at zero temperature.

Very generally, the reciprocity theorem implies that the Green tensor is symmetric
under combined exchange of the position arguments and vector indices [?]. For the
particular case of the half-space, we have checked this explicitly. In this case, we also
ﬁnd that only the part involving the reﬂection from the interface remains under the
derivative. This is because the (imaginary part of) the free space Green tensor depends
only on (r

r′)2, due to isotropy, and has vanishing ﬁrst derivative at r = r′.

In addition, they have no singularities in the upper half plane. The integral along

where we have used the symmetry properties of α and Gij. This result resembles up to
a factor of 2 and a
−∇1 the expression for the van der Waals–Casimir–Polder–London
energy given in [?]. The gradient occurs because we calculate the force, of course. To
understand the factor 2, we note that when the force is calculated from the energy,
both position dependences in Gii(r, r′ = r; ω) get differentiated. Close to a planar
surface, both give the same contribution, since in the Weyl plane-wave expansion (see
1.4.1), the reﬂected part of the Green tensor is proportional to eiγ(z+z′) where γ is the
normal component of the wave vector. In the planar geometry we consider here, the
force is oriented perpendicular to the interface, of course.

We ﬁnally note that it is a priori not clear that the light force derives from a potential
because we are dealing with a dissipative system. At ﬁnite temperature and in equi-
librium, the force is related to the energy change when the particle is displaced. This
creates electromagnetic ﬁelds that do work on the polarization ﬂuctuations, which
is partly dissipated in the system. The corresponding potential energy is given by

Here, at zero temperature and at lowest order in the polarizability, we do ﬁnd a poten-
tial since F can be written as a gradient. This need not be true at higher orders, how-
ever, because the combined state of atom and ﬁeld develops correlations (the density
matrix contains a term exp(d

E(r)/T ) involving the interaction Hamiltonian).

1.3 Fluctuation–dissipation theorem

We outline here a proof of the ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem for the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld close to some arbitary macroscopic object. The only require-
ment is that the object interacts in a linear way with the ﬁeld and that ther-
mal equilibrium prevails. This text is adapted from the review paper “Electro-
magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations on the nanometer scale” by C. Henkel, submitted
for publication in the Handbook of Theoretical and Computational Nanotechnology
(2004).

The ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic ﬁelds can be characterized by statistical
electrodynamics, which results from the application of equilibrium thermodynamics

11

and quantum theory to the macroscopic Maxwell equations [?]. We introduce in this
Section the basic deﬁnitions for the ﬁeld ﬂuctuation spectra and review how they can
be calculated. A key result in this context is the ﬂuctuation dissipation theorem de-
rived by Callen and Welton [?] whose proof is sketched here. We conclude with some
remarks on how to handle non-equilibrium situations.

1.3.1 Basic deﬁnition

We shall assume that at thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature T , the ﬁeld and
the solid medium can be described by a Gibbs ensemble: each state with energy E is
e−βE. In the quantized version
weighted with the Boltzmann factor exp(
−
of the theory, these states are stationary states: they are eigenstates with energy E
of the corresponding Hamilton operator ˆH. We shall work in the Heisenberg picture
where the ﬁeld variables (called observables) evolve in time, while the state of the
system is ﬁxed. The Gibbs ensemble is then characterized by the density operator

E/kBT )

This is an operator on the Hilbert space of the system that can be represented by a
ˆH/kBT ) is the trace of the
(inﬁnite-dimensional) matrix, the density matrix. Tr exp(
operator-valued Boltzmann factor, it is also called the partition function [?].

−

With respect to this equilibrium ensemble, we can deﬁne average values for the
observables of interest. This average combines the quantum expectation value in a
given stationary state with the corresponding statistical ensemble weights. The aver-
age electric ﬁeld, for example is given by

E(x, t)
h

i ≡

Tr [E(x, t)ˆρeq] = Tr [ˆρeqE(x, t)] ,

(27)

where we have made use of the cyclic permutation under the trace. The time-
dependence of the ﬁeld is generated by the Hamilton operator, so that we have

h

= Tr

exp(i ˆHt/¯h)E(x) exp(
h

−

i

i ˆHt/¯h)ˆρeq

= Tr [E(x)ˆρeq] ,

(28)

where E(x) is the electric ﬁeld operator at time zero and we have used that the Gibbs
density operator (26) is invariant under time evolution. The average can now be com-
puted in the Schr ¨odinger picture and is found to vanish at equilibrium. In the classical
theory, this is because the phase of the ﬁeld is uniformly distributed. In the quantum
theory, the stationary states for each mode of the ﬁeld (labelled by κ) are eigenstates of
the photon number operator a†
κaκ. The ﬁeld observable is a linear combination of the
annihilation and creation operators a†
κ and aκ that lower or raise the photon number:
their quantum expectation values thus vanish in a photon number eigenstate. More

and Wolf [?].

The relevant information about the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations is thus encoded in the corre-

This relation is also known as the Wiener-Khintchine theorem [?]. The spectrum is
actually a tensor, the cross-spectral density tensor. For x = x′, its components specify

the local polarization state of the ﬁeld. As a function of x
spatial coherence, i.e., the contrast of interference fringes in a double-slit experiment
with slits placed by x and x′, see, e.g., the textbooks by Mandel and Wolf [?] and by
Goodman [?]. As a function of the frequency ω, the spectrum speciﬁes the strength
of the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. This can be seen from the equivalent relation for the Fourier

The ﬂuctuation spectrum of the electric ﬁeld plays a key role for spontaneous and

by ω(k) = ck = c√k2. ‘H.C.’ denotes the hermitean conjugate operator so that the
electric ﬁeld is globally hermitean. In the absence of any sources, the annihilation and

In the last expression, we have made use of the free space DOS(ω) = ω2/π2c3. This
result has an intuitive explanation: the electric energy density is the density of modes
per unit volume, DOS(ω)dω, multiplied by one half of the average equilibrium en-
ergy ¯hω(¯n(ω) + 1
2 ) of a harmonic oscillator (the other half contributes to the magnetic
energy).

At zero temperature, the electric plus magnetic energy per mode is given by the
ground state oscillator energy ¯hω/2, and this leads to a divergent integral in the UV.
From this divergent zero-point energy, one can extract a ﬁnite, measurable energy
difference, called the Casimir energy, when the mode functions are changed by the
boundary conditions imposed by material structures. See the textbook by Mostepa-
nenko and Trunov [?] for more details. The energy measured by a photodetector
does not diverge because it is proportional to average of the photon number oper-
= ¯n(ω(k)) [?, ?]. If the creation and annihilation operators are ordered in
ator
this way, the divergent contribution of the zero-point energy disappears. The black-
body spectrum then shows an exponential decrease beyond the thermal wavelength
λth = 2π¯hc/(kBT ) (the Wien displacement law), and the frequency integral (39) be-
comes convergent.

and the ﬂuctuation spectrum by Eq. (30). Eq. (41) is actually true under more general
conditions and is known as a ﬂuctuation-dissipation (FD) theorem [?]. It holds for
linear systems and their ﬂuctuations around the thermal equilibrium state. The dis-
sipation is encoded in the imaginary part of the response function that characterizes
the linear response of the system to an external perturbation. The FD theorem is of the
form given here provided the Green tensor satisﬁes the symmetry condition speciﬁed
in Eq. (21).

The FD theorem will be our basic tool to compute ﬁeld ﬂuctuation spectra in the
near ﬁeld of nanostructures. We give in this Section an introduction for linear sys-
tems and summarize a general proof in the context of statistical electrodynamics. A
generalization to non-equilibrium situations is discussed in Section 1.3.4.

Johnson-Nyquist noise in metals. Consider a resistance at temperature T . One
observes a thermal ﬂuctuation of the current through the resistance, called Johnson
noise, whose variance in a given bandwidth ∆f = ∆ω/(2π) is given by the Nyquist
formula

i∆ω =

We now show that this formula can be related to a ﬂuctuation dissipation theorem
for the current density j(x) of the resistance. Consider ﬁrst the z-component of the
current density and a small volume element ∆V = ∆z ∆A. From the current noise
along the z-direction, one then has

where σ(ω) = ∆z/(R(ω)∆A) is the conductivity (the inverse of the speciﬁc resistance).
In the low frequency range where the Nyquist formula is valid, the conductivity can
be expressed via the dielectric function of the resistance, ε0ε(ω) = ε0 + iσ/ω. The
result (44) can thus be obtained by averaging the following relation over the volume

We have assumed that neighboring volume elements have uncorrelated current noise,
hence the spatial delta function. We use here the convention that the current noise (45)
(x, x′; ω) over intervals ∆ω/(2π) cen-
is given by the integral of the noise spectrum
ω. Since ω Im ε(x; ω) is an even function
tered at positive and negative frequencies
of ω, the noise spectrum is given by

This result has already the structure of the FD theorem (41). Since the dielectric func-
tion gives the polarization induced by an electric ﬁeld, a more natural formulation is
in terms of the polarization noise spectrum (writing j(ω) =

The temperature-dependent prefactor is the low-frequency limit of 2¯h/(e¯hω/kBT

occurring in Eq. (41). The spatial δ-function applies to a local dielectric response. The
generalization to a nonlocal medium is immediate: the ﬂuctuations are then correlated
on some characteristic scale, typically the mean free path.

−

We thus ﬁnd that the strength of the thermal Johnson noise at a given frequency in
an absorbing material is related to the amount of dissipation, as encoded in the imag-
inary part Im ε(ω). This permits to characterize the thermal polarization and magneti-
zation ﬂuctuations that appear in the macroscopic Maxwell equations.The noise spec-
trum of the polarization noise Pﬂ(x; ω) is given by the Johnson-Nyquist formula (47),
with the factor kBT replaced by ¯hω/(eβ¯hω
1) to be valid at all frequencies. If the ma-

The ﬂuctuating material polarization radiates an electromagnetic ﬁeld that, in thermo-
dynamic equilibrium, compensates for the loss of electromagnetic energy inside the
material. Only in this way is it possible to enforce the equipartition law of thermal
equilibrium, every degree of freedom (here the polarization ﬁeld) carrying an energy
kBT /2. Consider the balance of electromagnetic energy for a system without external
polarization sources. On the one hand, the mechanical work performed per unit time

We have taken into account that only the part of the ﬁeld radiated by the polarization
ﬂuctuation is correlated with the latter and expressed that ﬁeld in terms of the Green
tensor (42). A similar result holds for the magnetic contribution. On the other hand,
the average over the electric losses in the medium leads to the same expression

using the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem (41). As a result, the energy the polarization
emits into the ﬁeld [Eq.(49)] is exactly compensated for by the ﬁeld energy lost by
H
absorption, Eq.(50). This also implies that the average Poynting vector Re
vanishes, since there is no net energy transfer between medium and ﬁeld.

We shall see that in the quantized theory, the polarization ﬂuctuations of the mate-
rial also contribute to the quantum ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld. Otherwise, the dissipation
present in the macroscopic Maxwell equations would force the ﬁeld operators to de-
cay to zero, including their commutators. These are preserved due to the quantum
ﬂuctuations of the material polarization. This picture suggests as well the existence of
an FD theorem: the material loss that forces the ﬁelds to decay must be balanced by
the ﬂuctuations inside the material.

Properties of quantum ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. Before giving a general proof of the
FD theorem (41), let us summarize some of the properties it implies for the equilibrium
ﬂuctuations of quantized ﬁelds.

The FD theorem allows to compute the quantum and thermal ﬂuctuations of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld once the Green tensor is known. This quantity can be computed
by solving the macroscopic Maxwell equations with point-like dipole sources. As
long as the medium responds linearly to the ﬁeld, the classical version of the theory is
sufﬁcient, quantum and thermal ﬂuctuations are handled self-consistently using the
theorem.

The asymmetric frequency spectrum of zero-point or vacuum ﬂuctuations can be un-
derstood qualitatively by noting that in the ground state, a system can only ﬂuctuate
via a virtual transition towards a state with higher energy. The corresponding Bohr
frequencies are all positive. (That this leads to a spectral weight at negative ω is related
to our – conventional – choice of the exponential factor in the noise spectrum (30).) In
the high-temperature limit or, equivalently, for classical systems, upward and down-
ward transitions occur with equal probability, and the ﬂuctuation spectrum is sym-

At positive frequencies, Eq. (30) shows that the spectrum

(x, x′; ω) picks out that
part E(+)(x′, t′) of the electric ﬁeld operator that evolves like e−iωt′
. By analogy to
time-dependent wave functions in quantum mechanics, this part is called the positive
frequency part of the ﬁeld. In the mode expansion (32), it corresponds to the sum over
the annihilation operators aκ [see also Eq. (33)]. Similarly, only the negative frequency
part E(−)(x, t) = [E(+)(x, t)]† of the ﬁeld operator contributes in the ﬁrst factor. It
follows that in the vacuum state, the expectation value

vanishes since the annihilation operators, by deﬁnition, give zero when acting on the
vacuum state. This operator order (annihilation operators acting ﬁrst) is usually called
‘normal’ order. A typical example is the intensity measured by a photodetector [?, ?].
A nonzero vacuum expectation value occurs with the reverse operator order (creation
operators acting ﬁrst). This anti-normal order is picked out for negative frequencies in
(x, x′; ω). It gives nonzero results even in the vacuum state
the ﬂuctuation spectrum
(at zero temperature), as we have seen in Eq. (36) and in the FD theorem (41).

E

Proof of the FD theorem with linear response theory. As mentioned previ-
ously, the macroscopic Maxwell equations in an absorbing medium have to be sup-
plemented by material ﬂuctuations in order to be consistent with thermodynamics
and quantum theory. We thus split the polarization and magnetization operators into

P(x, t)

M(x, t)

7→

7→

Pﬂ(x, t) + Pext(x, t)
Mﬂ(x, t) + Mext(x, t)

(52)

where the terms with the subscript ‘ﬂ’ describe the ﬂuctuations in the material and the
‘ext’ all other sources like the dipole moments of atoms or molecules. In thermal equi-
librium, the ﬂuctuations average to zero, as we found after Eq. (28). In the following,
more explicit information about the polarization noise is not needed. We shall assume
that a Hamilton operator ˆH exists that generates the macroscopic Maxwell equations
as the Heisenberg equations of motion for the electric and magnetic ﬁeld operators.
(We are actually adopting a quantum Langevin picture, see Mandel and Wolf [?] and
Gardiner [?].) A similar demonstration has been given by Wylie and Sipe [?].

The ﬁeld ﬂuctuation spectrum, from Eq. (30), is given by the expectation value

We assume thermal equilibrium without external sources and have used the station-

of the ﬁeld to an external dipole oscillator, following Callen and Welton [?].

The solution for the electric ﬁeld operator in the presence of a polarization source
can be represented in terms of the Green tensor in the quantum theory as well because
the substitution (52) preserves the linearity of the macroscopic Maxwell equations. We
thus get the ﬁeld due to an operator-valued source, plus a term describing the free

The Green tensor can thus be identiﬁed with the linear response of the average ﬁeld
to a classical external polarization source (where Pext(x′; ω) is c-number valued).

The linear response of the ﬁeld can also be calculated directly from the Heisenberg
equations. This provides us with an alternative expression for the Green tensor where
equilibrium correlations will become apparent. For simplicity, we focus in the follow-
ing on the response to an electric point dipole at the position x′. The coupling of the
ﬁeld to the dipole is described by adding to the Hamiltonian the term

that χij(x, x′, τ ) is real as in the classical theory. Taking the Fourier transform of χij,

1.3.4 Non-equilibrium situations

A typical non-equilibrium situation that occurs in physics on the nanometer scale is a
temperature gradient inside a nanostructure. In thermal scanning probe microscopy,
to quote another example, structures are held at different temperatures, being in con-
tact with different reservoirs. These kind of settings can be described by a slight gener-
alization of the present theory provided one assumes that each volume element of the
solid structure is locally in thermal equilibrium at the temperature T (x). In this case,
we can write down the ﬂuctuation dissipation theorem for the thermal polarization
ﬁeld, by generalizing Eq. (47),

We have assumed a local dielectric response for simplicity. The corresponding ﬁeld
ﬂuctuation spectrum can be computed from the ﬁeld operator (54) where the freely
evolving ﬁeld (with material damping, but without material ﬂuctuations) and the
Green tensor appear. Without external sources, one gets

See Henry and Kazarinov for a similar approach [?]. The ﬁrst term is nonzero for
a bounded material surrounded by a non-absorbing dielectric (like free space) and
describes the photons incident from inﬁnity towards the observation points x, x′. It
accounts for all of the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations when there is no material absorption at all. If
the ﬁeld in the surrounding medium as assumed to be at zero temperature (like in the
visible frequency range), this term is zero for ω > 0. Even at ﬁnite temperature, how-
ever, this term is typically negligible at sub-wavelength distances from an absorbing
structure. Under these conditions, the second one dominates i.e., the radiation due to
the polarization noise (66). We summarize explicit examples above planar substrates
in the next Section.

22

Example: thermal van der Waals force. Consider a planar, dielectric substrate
at temperature T1/kB > 0, with the empty half-space above at zero temperature. This
describes a thermal source surrounded by a vacuum chamber with absorbing walls
at zero temperature [?]. (We neglect, of course, the heating of the walls due to the
radiation from the substrate.) This model is the idealization of a situation where the
dielectric is heated to a temperature higher than its surroundings.

The ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld now have two contributions: a ﬁrst
one coming from the thermal currents in the substrate, and a second one coming from
the vacuum ﬂuctuations in the empty half-space. Written schematically,

(cid:9)

There is no cross term because the two sources are not correlated. The spectrum Wij
describes the radiation of the substrate and is computed using the Lifshitz model: it is
the radiation produced by thermal current ﬂuctuations inside the substrate. The spec-
trum Vij describes the vacuum ﬁeld in the empty half-space. It may be calculated `a la
Lifshitz by allowing for a nonzero imaginary part into the vacuum dielectric constant
that is put to zero in the ﬁnal result [?, ?]. Alternatively, one can perform an explicit
ﬁeld quantization in the half-space [?] and retain only the modes incident from the
vacuum side. The result is the same in both cases, of course.

The contributions in (68) can be combined in the following way to recover the
equilibrium situation at T1 = 0. We recall that for ω < 0, the substrate ﬁeld spectrum

where the second term vanishes at zero temperature and is even in ω. Those terms
in (68) that survive at T1 = 0 combine to give the zero temperature ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem.

The radiation emitted by the substrate (the second term in (69)) gives the explicitly
temperature-dependent radiation. Note that this term is not the imaginary part of the
Green tensor because we are not dealing with an equilibrium situation. Its behaviour
as a function of frequency and the interpretation of the corresponding atom-surface
force is given in [?].

1.4 Example: planar surface

In this section, we calculate the properties of the electromagnetic ﬁeld close
to a planar surface. The ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem is used, and a plane

1.4.1 Electric and magnetic Green tensors

Consider a nonmagnetic solid with (relative) permittivity ε and permeability µ = 1
that ﬁlls the half-space z

the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the vacuum half-space, in particular for sub-wavelength

from the solid and is determined from the boundary conditions for the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds at z = 0. The decomposition (70) is convenient to compute the ﬁeld
ﬂuctuation spectra via the FD theorem (41) because it exhibits clearly the additional
contribution due to the scattering from the surface [?, ?]. This statement remains true
for scatterers of arbitrary shape, with more a complicated expression for the reﬂected
or scattered ﬁeld, of course.

Above a planar solid, the so-called Weyl expansion or angular spectrum represen-
tation provides a natural plane-wave basis for the incident and reﬂected ﬁelds, see the
textbook by Nieto-Vesperinas [?]. The xy-plane naturally plays a distinguished role
here. Introducing two-dimensional in-plane wave vectors Q = (qx, qy), we shall use
the notation

where n is the unit normal. One then has the following Fourier expansion for the

Note that the permittivity of the solid only enters via the Fresnel coefﬁcients. As long
as the planar symmetry is not broken, Eq. (72) can also be used above a multilayer
medium [?, ?]. Note that sign conventions differ for the Fresnel coefﬁcients and polar-
ization vectors; only the product of rµ and the polarization vectors appearing under
the sum in Eq. (72) has an unambiguous meaning.

We deﬁne the magnetic Green tensor by analogy to Eq. (42) as the magnetic induc-

tion ﬁeld radiated by a point magnetic moment

Bi(x; ω) =

Hij(x, x′; ω)µj.

From the Maxwell equations we ﬁnd that in terms of its electric counterpart, the mag-
netic Green tensor in the vacuum above the solid is given by the double curl

For the free space Green tensor, this leads to an expression similar to the electric case.

exchanges the polarization vectors (74) according to

tain the magnetic ﬁeld reﬂected from the solid by exchanging the reﬂection coefﬁcients

rp in Eq. (72).

1.4.2 Short distance expansions

To illustrate the behaviour of the ﬁeld at short distances, we review here asymptotic
expansions for the electric and magnetic Green tensors.

Electric ﬁeld. As a ﬁrst step, we show that in the near ﬁeld, the reﬂected part (72)
of the electric Green tensor takes a simple, electrostatic form. The integral over the
wave vector Q involves the factor eiqz(z+z′) which provides a natural cutoff for large
Q as soon as qz becomes imaginary with
ω/c. Analyzing the
qz| ≥

integrand, we notice that it peaks around the cutoff value. We thus get the leading
much larger than ω/c under the

dent of Q. This means that the reﬂection from the surface is nondispersive and can

1.4.3 Electromagnetic energy densities

Some of the results summarized above have been discussed by Joulain, Carminati,
Mulet, and Greffet in a recent paper on the deﬁnition and measurement of the LDOS
close to planar surfaces [?]. These authors analyze the spectrum of the electric and
magnetic energy densities ue(z; ω), um(z; ω) as a function of distance and point out
that the deﬁnition of the LDOS should be taken with care given the non-equivalent
role played by the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the near ﬁeld. To illustrate this, we
plot in Figure 1 the ratio um(z; ω)/ue(z; ω). Notice the strong dominance of the mag-
netic energy throughout the near ﬁeld range up to z
λ for a metallic surface. The
asymptotic formulas (85), (87) provide good agreement with a numerical calculation
based on the exact plane wave expansion (72) for the electric Green functions and its
magnetic equivalent.

∼

For a dielectric surface with an essentially real permittivity, the near ﬁeld energy
is dominantly electric, as shown in Fig. 1 (right). This behavior is not covered by the

2 Transitions

In this second part of the lecture, we discuss transitions between different
quantum states of a trapped atom that are induced by electromagnetic ﬂuc-
tuations. For atoms trapped close to surface, the relevant quantum states are:
Zeeman or hyperﬁne sublevels that are trapped in potentials of different steep-
ness (or not trapped at all), and center-of-mass eigenstates in the trapping po-
tential. In the ﬁrst case, transitions lead to trap loss or to the decoherence of
Zeeman or hyperﬁne superposition states. In the second case, ﬁeld ﬂuctua-
tions feed energy into the center-of-mass motion and give heating.

The transition rates can be computed, as a ﬁrst approximation, with
second-order perturbation theory, using Fermi’s Golden Rule. We shall ﬁnd
out that the rates are indeed small so that higher order corrections are usually
not needed. We show in particular that the transition rate is a meausre of the
cross spectral density of the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. Let us look ﬁrst at the transition
between different magnetic sublevels. The following section is adapted from
the paper “Fundamental limits for coherent manipulation on atom chips” by
C. Henkel, P. Kr ¨uger, R. Folman, and J. Schmiedmayer [Appl. Phys. B 76 (2003)
173].

2.1 Noise spectrum and spin ﬂip rate

The coupling of the atomic magnetic moment to ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁelds gives rise
to both spin ﬂips and changes in the center-of-mass motion (scattering). The rate of
these processes is given by Fermi’s Golden Rule. We recall here that it can be con-
veniently expressed in terms of the noise spectrum of the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations.
(See [?] for a similar approach and Chap. IV of [?] for the derivation of a full master
equation.)

Since mf
= mi, the matrix elements of µα are only nonzero for directions perpen-
dicular to the magnetic ﬁeld at the trap center. We also recover the selection rule

than one weak-ﬁeld seeking Zeeman states, mi = +2, +1, say, are trapped (possible
with many of the alkali atoms). This is because the matrix elements between adja-
cent sublevels do not signiﬁcantly differ in magnitude so that the atoms reach the
non-trapped sublevel mf = 0 after a time

2/Γ+2→+1.

We ﬁnally note that as long as the behaviour of the ‘environment’ (the ﬁeld) is ig-
nored in the description of the atom’s dynamics, the noise spectrum is the only quan-
tity needed to characterize the environment. It is also an experimentally measurable

2.2 Magnetic near ﬁeld noise

Eq.(99) clearly shows that we need the spectrum of the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctua-
tions for an estimate of the spin ﬂip transition rate. The ﬂuctuation–dissipation

The regime typical for trapped atom experiments is sub-wavelength distances,
where the magnetic Green tensor (remember: the ﬁeld radiated by a point
magnetic moment) is dominated by the part reﬂected or scattered from the sur-
face. From the short-distance expansion (86), we ﬁnd two regimes, depending
on the relatize magnitude of the distance compared to the skin depth inside
the surface material.

Very short distance, normal conductor. The skin depth δω is large compared
to the distance. As a scaling law for a normal metal,

δω = 160 µm

̺/̺Cu
ω/2π MHz !

 

1/2

where ̺ is the speciﬁc resistance. The scaling of the spin ﬂip rate is then

(102)

(103)

This estimate applies to a half-space. For absolute numbers, see the lecture
by J. Schmiedmayer. Note in particular that the ﬂip rate is independent of the

Larmor frequency. This is due to a conspiracy between the “density of states”
ω) and the Bose-Einstein occupation number
of the magnetic near ﬁeld (
(
∝

1/ω).
The estimate (103) can be extended to other geometries using the following
argument. In this “very short distance” regime, the distance z gives the depth
of the material that contributes signiﬁcantly to the magnetic noise outside the
surface. This has been checked by an explicit calculation in [?, ?]. Any structure
thicker than z thus essentially behaves like a half-space. One gets a reduction
of the magnetic noise spectrum for thinner ﬁlms or wires, for example. Each
dimension along which the metallic material becomes “ﬁnite” (characteristic
length a like thickness or wire radius) gives an additional factor a/z for the
noise spectrum and hence for the spin ﬂip rate. It is likely that this explains the
cross-over seen in the lifetime data vs. distance of J. Schmiedmayer’s group.

If one works in the short-distance regime, the optimal material choice is an
insulator (large resistance ̺). For strong magnetic ﬁelds, permanently magne-
tized structures can be used. Alternatively, materials may exist whose conduc-
tivity is reasonably large in the DC range and sufﬁciently small in the kHz to
MHz range that applies for the relevant transitions.

Intermediate distance, very good conductor. At larger distances or equiva-
lently, smaller resistance, the skin depth ultimately becomes smaller than the
distance. In this regime, a different power law is obtained. One gets a steeper
scaling with distance,

Γi→f ∝

T ̺1/2
ω1/2
L z4

,

(104)

which is now also frequency dependent. This regime should also apply to su-
perconducting substrates. Note that in the relevant frequency range, even a
superconductor shows some ﬁnite resistance due to the normal electron frac-
tion not bound into Cooper pairs.

In this regime, one can say that qualitatively, only the surface of the mate-
rial produces magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. The power laws for different geome-
tries therefore do not probably show the cross-over seen at short distance. The
problem is currently under study. Estimates for magnetic noise above super-
conducting substrates are given in the review by J. A. Sidles [?].

2.3 Other rates

The rate estimates for other processs like heating (excitation of higher trap
eigenstates) and decoherence (decay of a superposition of magnetic sublevels
into a statistical mixture) are discussed in the review paper by R. Folman
and colleagues [?] and in the review by C. Henkel and the J. Schmiedmayer
group [?]. The most robust choice for superposition states are magnetic sub-
levels that have the same magnetic moment. They are shifted in the same way
by magnetic ﬂuctuations so that their relative phase is preserved. Such states
exists in alkali atoms, they have the same orientation of the electron spin and
opposite nuclear spins. The difference in magnetic moment is only provided
by the nuclear magneton which is much smaller than the Bohr magneton, by
roughly the mass ratio between the nucleon and the electron.

Conclusion

Atoms are a sensitive probe of electromagnetic ﬁelds close to surfaces. Their
energy level shifts depend on the reﬂection or scattering of the ﬁeld from the
surface, integrated over the entire frequency range. At short distances, the
range around atomic transition frequencies gives the dominant contribution.
This can lead, for a “hot” surface, to interesting non-equilibrium forces.

Transitions between different “internal” atomic states or the heating in a
trap close to a surface gives directly access to the ﬁeld’s cross spectral density
at the transition frequency, provided perturbation theory holds. In magnetic
traps that conﬁne only a subset of Zeeman sublevels, the magnetic spectrum is
the dominant driving agent for transitions and leads to trap loss, heating, and
decoherence. The corresponding rates show different characteristic scalings
with distance and substrate geometry, depending on the size of the skin depth
inside the material.

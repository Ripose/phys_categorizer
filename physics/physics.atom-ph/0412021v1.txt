Chaos and localization in the wavefunctions of complex atoms NdI, PmI and SmI

Dilip Angom and V. K. B. Kota
Physical Research Laboratory, Navarangpura, Ahmedabad - 380 009

Wavefunctions of complex lanthanide atoms NdI, PmI and SmI, obtained via multi-conﬁguration
Dirac-Fock method, are analyzed for density of states in terms of partial densities, strength functions
(Fk(E)), number of principal components (ξ2(E)) and occupancies (hnαiE) of single particle orbits
using embedded Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of one plus two-body random matrix ensembles
[EGOE(1+2)]. It is seen that density of states are in general multi-modal, Fk(E)’s exhibit variations
as function of the basis states energy and ξ2(E)’s show structures arising from localized states. The
sources of these departures from EGOE(1+2) are investigated by examining the partial densities,
correlations between Fk(E), ξ2(E) and hnαiE and also by studying the structure of the Hamiltonian
matrices. These studies point out the operation of EGOE(1+2) but at the same time suggest that
weak admixing between well separated conﬁgurations should be incorporated into EGOE(1+2) for
more quantitative description of chaos and localization in NdI, PmI and SmI.

INTRODUCTION

Lanthanide atoms exhibit complicated conﬁguration mixing and have complex spectra [1] as consequence of par-
tially ﬁlled high angular momentum 4f and 5d valence shells. The general form of the ground state conﬁguration is
[Xe]6s24f m5dn, where m and n are the shell occupancies. Across the period m increases from 1 to 14, whereas n is 1
for Ce I and Gd I which are located at the beginning and middle of the period and n is 0 for the remaining lanthanide
atoms. Along the period the number of conﬁgurations and mixing increases as 4f shell occupancy increases, and
reaches a maximum around the middle. Lanthanide atoms are appropriate to study complexities emerging from two-
body interactions and a comparative study along the period could provide insights to the implications of increasing
particle number to the nature of the complexity.

Detailed studies of Ce I wave-function structure, ﬁrst carried out by Flambaum and collaborators [2, 3] showed
the smoothed (with energy) strength functions (Fk(E)) and number of principle components (NPC or ξ2(E)), which
measure chaoticity, can be understood in terms of banded random matrices (BRM) with the local level and strength
ﬂuctuations following the predictions of Wigner’s Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) of random matrices. Later
studies of Cummings and collaborators on Pr I (and also Ce I) [4], the element next to Ce I in the lanthanide series,
showed results in agreement with Flambaum et al studies of CeI. Flambaum and collaborators further developed,
using the BW form for Fk(E) and NPC in terms of the BW spreading widths which are a result of many body
chaos, a statistical theory for the distribution of occupation numbers [5, 6], and also for electromagnetic transition
strengths in atoms with complex (or chaotic) spectra [7]. Applying this statistical spectroscopy for complex states,
energy-averaged cross sections are obtained in terms of sums over single electron orbitals and using this Flambaum
et al [8] and Gribakin et al [9] explained the observed, and quite puzzling, low-energy electron recombination rate of
Au25+.

Following the successful applications in nuclei [10–13], mesoscopic physics [14], in the context of quantum com-
puters [15] and as suggested more recently for example in the dynamics of cold atoms [16], a better random matrix
hypothesis for atoms is to consider the interaction (after subtracting the single particle ﬁeld generated by the Coulomb
Hamiltonian see Eq. (5) ahead for the Hamiltonian) to be random. This gives rise to embedded GOE of one plus
two-body interactions [EGOE(1+2)]. See Sect. III ahead for details of EGOE(1+2) and here it suﬃces to say that

random matrix ensemble (TBRE). Recently we demonstrated that Sm I [17], which has three more active electrons
compared to Pr I, carries TBRE signatures which include Gaussian state densities, strength functions having Gaussian
form, NPC as a function of energy is of Gaussian form, local level ﬂuctuations follow GOE etc. Going beyond this
limiting situation, EGOE(1+2) with increasing interaction strength (equivalently with increasing particle number if
the interaction is ﬁxed), strength functions exhibit Breit-Wigner to Gaussian transition. It is important to stress that
EGOE(1+2) at the weak limit (λ small) shares features with BRM, for example the BW form for strength functions
(this explains partly the applicability of BRM for CeI and PrI). In a recent paper [18], an interpolating function, anal-
ogous to the Brody distribution for nearest neighbor spacing distribution, representing the BW to Gaussian transition
of the strength function is reported (see Eq. (23) ahead) and it is used to understand this transition in rare earth
atoms (at the spectrum’s center) as we go from CeI to SmI with valence electrons changing from 4 to 8. In addition,
it is noticed in NdI, PmI and SmI studies that the eigenfunctions exhibit localization properties. The presence of
localized states is also evident in the study of Ce I and Pr I by Cummings and collaborators [4].

earth atoms is large ( for example, in Pr I the number of allowed 4f 36s2

is diﬃcult to study the transitions individually. However, statistical spectroscopy, based on TBRE and many-body
chaos, provides a means to understand the smoothed part of these transitions (with ﬂuctuations following GOE).
In this paper we consider NdI, PmI and SmI with 6,7 and 8 valence electrons and examine in some detail: (i) the
extent to which EGOE(1+2) applies for these atoms; (ii) localization properties of wavefunctions; (iii) the structure
of the Hamiltonian matrix. For (i) and (ii), wavefunctions are analyzed in terms of density of states as sum of
partial densities, strength functions, NPC and occupancies of single particle orbits and correlations between them.
These results form Section IV of the paper. Section V discusses the structure of the Hamiltonian matrices and
the modiﬁcations to be incorporated in EGOE(1+2) for a more quantitative description of chaos and localization in
lanthanide atoms. For completeness, Section II gives the method of atomic structure calculations and Section III gives
the deﬁnition and a brief discussion of some of the basic results for EGOE(1+2). Finally Section V gives conclusions

II. METHOD OF ATOMIC CALCULATIONS

A. Multi-Conﬁguration Dirac-Fock method

The earlier works on lanthanide atoms [20] have shown that the multiconﬁguration Dirac-Fock ( MCDF) method
is suitable for studying the structure and calculating properties of these atoms. The method is the relativistic
equivalent of multiconﬁguration Hartree-Fock (MCHF) [21] used extensively in non-relativistic atomic calculations.
For a detailed description of MCDF see ref [22] and several groups have implemented it to study atom and molecules
[23]. For completeness and continuity important features of the method are described in this section. The essence of
MCDF is the calculation of orbitals in a mean ﬁeld arising from a linear combination of conﬁgurations. Then, the
single particle states are the eigenstates of variationally calculated single-electron Schr¨odinger equations and these are
represented as

are the spinor spherical harmonics in the lsj coupling scheme. The many electron basis functions of the method
are the conﬁguration state functions (CSF’s) [21]. Each CSF is represented as
, where P , J and M are the

parity, total angular momentum and magnetic quantum numbers, and γ is a quantum number to identify each CSF
uniquely. The CSFs are constructed in two steps: ﬁrst couple the identical electrons in each sub-shell niκi to give Xi,
and second couple Xi to obtain J. The construction of the CSFs are better described in second quantized notations,

The starting point of the MCDF method is the variational optimization of an energy functional deﬁned in terms of
H DC and Lagrange multipliers with respect to one or more ASFs. The parameters of variational optimization are the
coeﬃcients cγr and orbitals ψnκ(r). In general, the energy functional is extremized with respect to the ground state.
Another class of MCDF calculations is the extended optimal level (EOL), where the energy functional is extremized
using a set of ASFs. We use the later method in our calculations and the advantages over the general method is
explained in the next subsection. The energy functional of MCDF-EOL calculation is

B. Orbital calculation and conﬁguration interaction

The calculation of an appropriate set of orbitals

ψ(r)
is crucial in atomic structure and properties calculations.
}
In the present work we calculate the orbitals using the MCDF method described in the previous subsection. This
method can include strong conﬁguration mixing, however the orbitals generated are state speciﬁc, this is undesirable
for statistical studies involving several excited states. To strike a balance between these two features of MCDF method,
orbitals are generated within selected CSF space and the energy functional is optimized with respect to several states
using MCDF-EOL method. The orbitals generated are less state speciﬁc as these are calculated in the potential of
several states self-consistently. The orbital set of each atom are generated in a series of calculations described in this
section.

Valence orbital 6p is generated in another calculation with frozen core approximation, where the orbitals of the ground
conﬁguration generated in the previous calculation are held ﬁxed. The CSF space of the calculation consists of single
excitation from the ground conﬁguration to 6p. The orbital 5d is generated in a similar calculation if it is unoccupied (
n = 0) in the ground conﬁguration. Thus, in relativistic notations, the orbital set consists of (1
6)p1/2,3/2,
(3
5)d3/2,5/2 and 4f5/2,7/2. Out of these 6s1/2, 4f5/2,7/2, 6p1/2,3/2 and 5d3/2,5/2 are valence shells, then the number
of valence shells Nv and core shells Nc are 7 and 17 respectively. All the orbitals are made spectroscopic, that is, each
1 ( where n and l are the principal and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers) number
orbital has n
of nodes. The other possibility is calculating the orbitals without imposing the constraint on the number of nodes.
Orbitals of this type are referred to as correlation orbitals. These are usually contracted, state speciﬁc and represent
correlation eﬀects of speciﬁc states very well. For statistical properties calculations, the spectroscopic orbitals are
appropriate. The MCDF calculations to generate the orbitals include important intra valence correlation eﬀects but it
is incomplete within the orbital basis considered. A conﬁguration interaction (CI) calculation, which is diagonalization
of H DC matrix, of all the possible CSFs can capture the remaining correlation eﬀects. However, such a calculation is
impossible as the size of the CSF space increases exponentially with the number of active valence electrons and Nv.
In our calculations the CSF space consists of single and double excitations from the ground conﬁguration

approximation of the ground state, K is also the number of determinants in the manifold which includes the single

further analysis, consider these K determinants as the manifold chosen for calculations. As mentioned in the context
of CSFs, the representation of two-electron Coulomb interaction is incomplete in such a determinantal manifold. This
is because, the Coulomb interaction couples pairs of determinants which diﬀer by one or two occupancies. Hence,
for the singly excited determinants, the zeroth order description of Coulomb interaction is incomplete without the
triply excited ones. The quadruply excited are similarly needed for the doubly excited determinants. Among the K

III. EIGENFUNCTION PROPERTIES IN EGOE(1+2)

This section gives a brief introduction to EGOE(1+2) and a summary, for later use, of the results known for this

random matrix ensemble; see [11] for a review on this subject and also [18].

A. Deﬁnition of EGOE(1+2)

EGOE(2) for m (m > 2) fermion with the particles distributed say in N single particle states
, i = 1, 2, . . . , N ) is
generated by deﬁning the Hamiltonian H, which is 2-body, to be GOE in the 2-particle space and then propagating
it to the m-particle spaces by using the geometry (direct product structure) of the m-particle spaces. Operator form
for a 2-body Hamiltonian H=V(2) is deﬁned by,

B. Basic properties of EGOE(1+2)

Most signiﬁcant aspect of EGOE(1+2) is that as λ changes, in terms of state density, level ﬂuctuations, strength
functions and entropy, the ensemble admits three chaos markers as described in Fig. 1 and reviewed in [18]. Firstly,
it is well known, via the EGOE(2) results in [10, 25] and the fact that general h(1)’s produce Gaussian densities,
m take Gaussian form, for large enough m, for all λ values (often the

systems. For the BW to Gaussian transition, a good interpolating function has been constructed recently [18],

In writing (24), it is assumed that the level and strength ﬂuctuations are of GOE type and hence it is valid only for

Also, in general ρh(Ek) is also a Gaussian for EGOE(1+2). Assuming that α and β are k-independent, ξ2(E) in the
BW to Gaussian transition domain can be evaluated by substituting Fk:BW −G for Fk(E) in (24). At the spectrum

It is important to point out that the eigenstates of atoms carry good angular momentum (J) (in some situa-
tions even good L, S) and therefore in principle one should consider EGOE(1+2) preserving J-symmetry (called
EGOE(1+2)-J in [11]). Theory for EGOE(1+2)-J is not available (see however [33, 34] for some ﬁrst attempts), and
just as in the nuclear shell model studies [11, 35], it is assumed that the forms for ρH (E), Fk(E), (NPC)E etc. derived
using EGOE(1+2) for spinless fermion systems, extend to J spaces. This can be considered to be an aspect of chaos
in atoms and this is the basis for statistical atomic spectroscopy as being developed by Flambaum; see [3, 8, 36] and
references therein.

IV. RESULTS FOR ρH (E), Fk(E), ξ2(E) AND hnαiE

In the present study, we select the J = 4+ CSF manifold for Nd and Sm atoms. The parity is chosen equal to the
parities of the ground conﬁgurations 4f 46s2 and 4f 66s2 respectively and the total angular momentum J is the same
as in the Ce I work [2]. For Pm, which has an odd number (i.e. 7) of active valence electrons we choose J = 9/2−
CSFs. The parity is again equal to the ground conﬁguration parity 4f 56s2. It is to be reiterated that, the orbitals
of the present study are diﬀerent from our earlier work [17]. As mentioned in Section II B, the orbitals in this work
are calculated in a multiconﬁguration potential, whereas in [17], the orbitals are calculated in a single conﬁguration
potential. The manifolds of the Nd, Pm and Sm have 2200, 4375 and 7325 CSFs respectively. The CSFs are generated
in the sequence of sub-shell occupations but later, these are energy ordered. The CI calculation is carried out within
the whole space for Nd and Pm. For Sm, as mentioned in [17], the density of states ρ(E) is bimodal. We select the
ﬁrst 6300 CSFs which contribute to the ﬁrst peak for the CI calculation. The atomic state
of the Nd, Pm, and
Sm obtained from the CI calculations have energy range of 2.20, 2.27 and 1.60 hartree respectively.

is a sequence of δ-functions. For obtaining the smoothed (with
respect to energy E) density of states and for comparison with the EGOE(1+2) predictions of ρH,m(E), we construct
the binned density of states. In the our calculations, the energy range of
of each atom is divided into sixty bins
of equal sizes. The density of states is then binned and normalized, these are shown in Fig.3. The Gaussian and
Edgeworth corrected Gaussian calculated from the centroid ǫ, variance σ2, skewness γ1 and excess γ2 of ρ(E) are also
shown in the ﬁgure ( ǫ, σ2, γ1 and γ2 values are given in the ﬁgure). For SmI Gaussian is in good agreement with
the ρ(E) except at and around the centroid. At the centroid the Gaussian is
13% less than the actual ρ(E). In
general all ρ(E) are multimodal in structure and it is most prominent in Nd. The ρ(E) for Nd has a pronounced peak
1.5 and ﬂuctuations above the mean for ˆE between 1.0 and 2.5. Similarly for Pm, ρ(E) has a pronounced

The separation between the conﬁgurations persists in
as the smaller peak of the bimodal ρH,m(E). The energy range of the remaining conﬁgurations show large overlaps
and contribute to the main peak of the Nd ρH,m(E). The 4f 36s26p conﬁguration which lie between 4f 46s5d and
4f 45d2 energetically, is single replacement from 4f 45d2 and doesn’t contribute to smoothing the ρH,m(E). Fig.4b
shows the result of Eq. (29) with partial densities represented by Gaussians for Nd. The agreement between theory
and calculations is excellent. This demonstrates that it is possible to construct the total density of states as sums
of Gaussian partial densities (even though a single Gaussian representation as shown in Fig. 3 deviates strongly
from the calculated results). This result is signiﬁcant as it is possible to calculate the centroids and variances (also
partial variances) without recourse to H matrix construction [37]. Similar to the Nd, the bimodal structure of the
Pm’s ρH,m(E) is a consequence of the small overlap between the partial densities of the 4f 46s5d6p and 4f 56p2
conﬁgurations. However, unlike Nd, these conﬁgurations are in the higher end of the energy range. In contrast to Nd
and Pm, the Sm atom has partial densities with large overlap and the ρH,m(E) is without prominent secondary peaks.

ǫk = 0 and this is diﬀerent from the procedure
constructed by averaging Fk(E) over 3% of the basis states around
ǫk = 0, ﬁrstly it

is seen that the parameter α in Eq. (23) is k dependent and it changes from a value close to that of BW to a value
giving close to Gaussian form as
ǫk is increasing from -1.5. For Nd, Pm and Sm α changes from 2 to 5.2, 2.5 to 7.5
and 2.5 to 10.6 respectively. The variation in α seen in Fig. 5 is understood from the fact that near the Fermi surface
(i.e. for
1) the levels are well separated and hence the mixing is weak giving BW form and as we go
towards the center the mixing is strong giving close to Gaussian (or between BW and Gaussian) form. It should be
pointed out that EGOE(1+2) ensemble do not produce large changes in α as k changes in Fk(E). However, in all
the calculations it is seen that σk is essentially constant as expected from EGOE(1+2). Clearly, the Fk(E) analysis
shows that modiﬁcations of EGOE(1+2) are needed.

The inverse participation ratio ξ2(E) of an eigenstate is the eﬀective number of basis functions contributing to it. It
provides a measure for the presence of chaos in the system. For a GOE with dimension d, the NPC is d/3 independent

are calculated and shown in Fig. 6a-c. The ξ2(E) of Nd and Pm
(26)). The ξ2(E) of Nd, Pm and Sm for all
are multimodal and localized states (i.e. states with NPC much smaller than GOE or EGOE(1+2) predicted values)
are prominent in all the atoms. We should add that localized states are also observed in the previous studies on
Ce I [2] and Pr I [4].
In addition, more recently, localization quite similar to those shown Fig.6 are also seen in
U 28+ calculations [38]. Despite localization, Nd and Pm have Breit-Wigner like envelopes, whereas for Sm it is like
Gaussian. Nd and Pm have Gaussian like secondary peaks around
1.4 respectively and it is to be noted
that, these are the locations where ρH,m(E) has local peaks. For Sm, like ρH,m(E), it is unimodal. At the centroid
of the envelopes, the value of ξ2(E) are
0.5 for Nd, Pm and Sm respectively. These should be
compared with the EGOE(1+2) values given by Eq. (25) (for the Nd, Pm and Sm atoms, ζ2 is 0.88, 0.86 ans 0.83
respectively) and they are 0.44, 0.48 and 0.55 respectively. Here it is assumed that α value at the ˆǫk = 0 can be
used for all ˆǫk’s. However this is not a good approximation as seen from Fig.6. In a better calculation we use Eq.
(24), where the integral is divided into seven segments each with ˆǫk spread .5 in the range -1.75 to 1.75. Within each
segment Fk(E) is constructed with α taken for the mid ˆǫk but incorporating exact Fk(E) centroids and widths. This
calculation gives overall good description for Sm while for Pm there are deviations for ˆǫk > 0. This is not surprising
because there is a secondary peak for ˆE > 0, which cannot be accounted in the EGOE(1+2) model adopted. For Nd
we have not shown the result as the α for ˆǫk =
1.0 is undetermined. Assuming an interpolating value of α, it is seen
that the calculations describe reasonably well ξ2(E) for ˆE < 0.

In Fig. 6d-f ξ2(E) is binned to remove local ﬂuctuations and the resulting histograms are shown. They give at the
center the ξ2(E) to be 0.27, 0.33 and 0.48 for Nd, Pm and Sm respectively. Finally, though the number of localized
states appear numerous in the plots, they are in fact not that many. This is seen clearly from Fig. 6g-i where the
relative density of localized states is plotted as a histogram. We classify a state as localized if it has ξ2(E) less than
or equal to 20% of the binned value in corresponding energy range. As shown in Fig. 6g-i the number of localized
states in each energy bin ρloc(E) is small for all the atoms studied. This indicates the diﬀerence between the envelope
and binned ξ2(E) is due to high frequency ﬂuctuations and not due to purely localized states. In order to understand
more about localized states an analysis is carried out in terms of occupancies of single electron orbits and we will turn
to this now.

D. Occupation number hnαiE and the localized states

In the statistical description of a many-body quantum system, properties of the system are often expressed as
functions of the sub-shell occupation numbers [8]. In this section, we use sub-shell occupation numbers to study the
nature of the localized states. By deﬁnition the occupation number of the sub-shell α in

V. HAMILTONIAN MATRIX STRUCTURE

Understanding the structure of the Hamiltonian matrix is crucial for developing an appropriate random matrix
model for the Lanthanide atoms. The diagonal Hamiltonian matrix elements H DC
kk will have contributions from both
the one and two particle Hamiltonian terms. However, the oﬀ diagonal terms H DC
kk′ have non-zero contributions
k′
. If the two CSFs are singly
from the Hamiltonian terms depending on the relative excitation between
i
|
excited with respect to each other, then one and two particle terms contributes, whereas only the two particle term
contributes when the two CSFs are doubly excited with respect to each other. The oﬀ diagonal matrix elements are
zero for triple or higher excitations. As a consequence, the Hamiltonian matrix is sparse. In our present calculations,
several of the CSFs which are doubly excited with respect to ground conﬁguration are quadruply excited with respect
to each other. For example the conﬁgurations 4f m−25dn+26s2 and 4f m5dn6p2 are doubly excited with respect to
the ground conﬁguration 4f m5dn6s2, however they are quadruply excited with respect to each other. Hence, all the
matrix elements between CSFs arising from 4f m−25dn+26s2 and 4f m5dn6p2 are zero. There are other conﬁgurations
similar to these in the CI space considered. Due to these conﬁgurations, the Hamiltonian matrix in our calculations is
sparse, though we consider only the single and double excitations from the ground state conﬁguration. For bringing
out a coarse grained structure of the Hamiltonian matrix, the square of matrix elements (H DC
kk′ )2 (to remove the phase
factor) is calculated and binned in terms of the diagonal elements H DC
kk . The element Wij of the binned Hamiltonian
for bin size ∆ is then

where i′ = i
∆. The plot of binned Hamiltonian for Nd, Pm and Sm are shown in Fig.9. To improve
the contrast the plots show ln(Wij ) instead of the Wij . In all the three atoms: (i) band like structure is evident,
however, there are also block structures within the band; (ii) another important feature is the prominent streaks of
large matrix elements parallel to the diagonal, these mix two diagonal blocks and, as mentioned in [39], perturbative
calculation can account for these distant elements; (iii) the Hamiltonian matrices of Nd and Pm have small range of
energy with no states and these are the empty stripes in the ﬁgures.

Presence of prominent diagonal blocks in the ﬁgures (point (i) above) is a consequence of the spread of the various
conﬁgurations shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1. Though it is tempting to conclude that there is a BRM like structure,
it should be noted that the various blocks retain their identity each with their own internal variance σ2(
m).
m′) (except in some special cases) are in general much

smaller compared to the internal variances. It should be pointed out that block matrix structure as in Fig. 9 is also
observed very recently in nuclear shell model calculations [40, 41] and it is plausible that such structure is a feature
of interacting particle systems. In [40, 41] it is argued that one of sources for this structure is J symmetry. The
various blocks are much more well separated in Nd and Pm as compared to Sm and as a result Sm is much closer to
EGOE(1+2) with Nd and Pm exhibiting larger localization with departures from EGOE(1+2) predictions.

To gain better understanding of the oﬀ-diagonal matrix (i.e. (i) and (ii) above), which will mix the CSF’s, let us
consider their structure in some detail. In the present calculations the oﬀ diagonal Hamiltonian matrix elements H DC

where GK (γ, δ; α, β) and RK(γ, δ; α, β) are angular and radial integrals respectively, and K is the multipole. The
angular momentum selection rules are consequence of GK(γ, δ; α, β) and the radial integral also known as Slater
integral [42]. In total there are N 2
1)2/4 matrix elements of 1/r12 which contribute to the oﬀ-diagonal
Hamiltonian matrix elements; Nv and Nc are deﬁned in Section II. The many-particle matrix elements of 1/r12 can

where CK,JM
(γ, δ; α, β) is the angular factor which transports the single particle matrix elements to the many-particle
space. The C’s consists of two components, ﬁrst the angular factor in the single electron space and second a component
which propagate from the single electron to many electron space. These will have complex structure when electrons
of several open-shells are coupled and the distribution of the non-zero Hamiltonian matrix exhibit intricate patterns.
Interestingly, nuclear shell model calculations showed that [40, 41] the angular factors generate a part of the GOE
structure of the diagonal blocks. The radial integral is large for K = 0 in Eq. (35) and it is an allowed multipole
when κα = κγ and κβ = κδ. This can couple energetically well separated conﬁgurations strongly and explain (ii)
above. Finally, from the matrix structure one can understand qualitatively the departures of Fk(E) and ξ2(E) from
EGOE(1+2). In this random matrix ensemble the two-particle matrix elements variance (the parameter v2 in Eq.
(18)) is independent of its position (i.e.
independent of the indices (i, j, k, l) in Eq. (18) except that the diagonal
matrix elements have twice the variance of the oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements).

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK

−
∼ −

In this paper wavefunctions of complex lanthanide atoms Nd, Pm and Sm are analyzed in terms of strength
functions, number of principal components, occupation numbers and also the Hamiltonian matrix structure. Exam-
ination of Fk(E) showed that the BW form is dominant in Nd, they are more towards Gaussian in Pm and quite
close to Gaussian in Sm for the basis states not very far from the ǫk centroids. All three atoms exhibit BW form for
1. Thus the statistical spectroscopy developed by Flambaum et al [5–7] will be good for as long as Fk(E) with
ˆǫk <
ˆǫk <
1 contribute to observables of interest. In all these atoms there are localized states throughout the spectrum
( though the density is not high) and this is clearly seen in the measure NPC. The structure of the localized states
is closely correlated with the occupation numbers. All these and the matrix structures showed that EGOE(1+2)
need to be modiﬁed. One approach is to partition the two-particle space and employ diﬀerent variances for diﬀerent
block matrices and then propagate the ensemble to many particle spaces. Very few properties of these partitioned
EGOE(1 + 2)) are known till now [11] and clearly they should be studied in more detail. The induced
ensembles (p
TBRE introduced recently [43] are closely related to p-EGOE(1+2). Another approach is consider the two-particle
Hamiltonian as a mixture of a regular part (say determined by the lower order multipoles in Eq.(36)) and a random
part and analyze them as a function of the strength of the random part (they are called K + αEGOE(2) in [11]
where K is a ﬁxed operator, and numerically some studies of such an ensemble are carried out using nuclear shell
model recently [12]). Thus an important outcome of the present detailed analysis (presented in Sections II-V) is that
for further progress in understanding the wavefunction structure in complex atoms it is necessary to analyse various
modiﬁed EGOE’s and this is for future.

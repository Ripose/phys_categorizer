We present the simultaneous cooling and trapping of an isotopic mixture in a magneto-optical
trap and we describe the transfer of the mixture into a conservative, far-oﬀ resonant dipole trap.

trap. We observe fast inter-species thermalization in the dipole trap which allows one to set a lower
bound on the 88Sr-86Sr elastic cross section.

Recently laser cooled atomic strontium has been the
subject of active researches in various ﬁelds spanning
from all-optical cooling towards quantum degeneracy for
bosonic and fermionic isotopes [1, 2], cooling physics
[3, 4], continuous atom laser [5], detection of ultra-narrow
transitions [6, 7, 8, 9], multiple scattering [10], and colli-
sional theory [11].

As a result of the eﬃcient second stage Doppler cool-
ing, strontium is a promising candidate to reach quantum
degeneracy. Second stage Doppler cooling [1] working
on the 1S0-3P1 intercombination transition (see ﬁgure 1)
combined with optical dipole trapping was proven eﬀec-
tive to directly reach phase space densities of ρ = 0.1 [12].
Further increase of ρ seems to be limited by light as-
sisted collisions and direct evaporative cooling was not
reported so far. Alternative cooling techniques are of-
fered by mixtures of diﬀerent atomic species [13] or dif-
ferent isotopes [14][15]. Mixtures oﬀer a way to exploit
collisional physics not applicable in single species sam-
ples. They also oﬀer additional degrees of freedom such
as sympathetic cooling in order to achieve the degener-
ate quantum regime with atoms for which evaporative
cooling is not eﬃcient [16].

In this article we present the simultaneous cooling and
trapping of isotopes of atomic strontium in a magneto-
optical trap (MOT) [17] and we describe the transfer of
the mixture into a conservative, far-oﬀ resonant dipole
trap (FORT). The isotopic mixture is prepared with a
new technique based on sequentially loading diﬀerent iso-
topes into a magnetic trapped metastable state through
the leakage of a MOT operating on a single isotope. Af-
terwards the magnetically trapped mixture is optically
pumped down to the ground state for further cooling
close to the recoil limit on the intercombination 1S0-3P1
transition. Then the mixture is loaded into a FORT.

FIG. 1: Relevant energy levels and optical transitions for
laser cooling and trapping of strontium.

The advantage of this method comparing with previous
works based on simultaneous optical cooling and trapping
of two species [14, 15], is the drastic simpliﬁcation of the
laser source and the elimination of possible interferences
between the simultaneous loading into the MOTs. For
the sake of clarity we start by describing the production
of a single-isotope sample, then we explain how we extend
the procedure to the production of isotopic mixtures.

In the experimental setup we use a thermal source of
strontium atoms as described in [8]. The strontium is
evaporated in an oven heated to 500◦C. The atomic beam
is collimated through a bundle of capillaries which limits
the geometric divergence to 50 mrad full width. After
the capillaries, the atomic beam brightness is increased
by a factor 4 with a transverse cooling stage realized with
multipass beams [18] in two orthogonal planes, with a
frequency oﬀset by 20 MHz to the red of the 1S0-1P1
transition (Γ/2π=32 MHz). After the collimation stage
the atomic beam is slowed to a few tens of m/s in a
30-cm long Zeeman-slower [19] based on a two stage ta-
pered coil with zero crossing magnetic ﬁeld and a counter-
propagating laser beam tuned 15 Γ to the red of the 1S0-

FIG. 2: Metastable 3P2 state decay when trapped in a 56

vidual isotopes with the 1S0-1P1 MOT switched oﬀ (circles:
86Sr, lifetime τ = 4.7 s. Squares: 88Sr, τ = 6.6 s), and with
the 1S0-1P1 MOT operating on the undetected isotope (dia-
monds: 86Sr with 88Sr MOT, τ = 4.7 s. Triangles: 88Sr with

1P1 transition. The light beam is typically 18 mW, has a
7 mm e−2 radius at the MOT and is focused on the capil-
laries, 85 cm away from the MOT. The slowed atoms are
then further cooled and trapped in a MOT working on
the 1S0-1P1 transition red detuned by 40 MHz from the
resonance. The MOT is formed by three retro-reﬂected
beams with a e−2 radius of 5 mm crossing almost orthog-
onally, with the vertical beam collinear with the magnetic
quadrupole axis of an anti-Helmholz pair of coils. The
total 461 nm light incident on the MOT region amounts
to 46 mW/cm2, and the magnetic gradient is 56 G/cm.
The atom number, spatial density and temperature are
derived in time-of-ﬂight by imaging on a CCD camera
the atomic absorption of a 70 µs probe beam resonant
on the 1S0-1P1transition. The 461 nm light source for
the ﬁrst cooling stage, as described in [20], is based on
frequency doubling of a semiconductor laser. It routinely
delivers 150 mW at 461 nm in a 4 MHz linewidth FWHM.
The source is frequency stabilized with saturated spec-
troscopy on a strontium vapor cell [21].

After the initial capture in the blue MOT, and follow-
ing the approach described in [1], the atoms are further
cooled in a MOT operating on the 1S0-3P1 intercombi-
nation line at 689 nm. The 689 nm light is provided by
a master-slave semiconductor laser system which is fre-
quency narrowed by locking to an optical cavity which is,
in turn, steered to the 1S0-3P1 transition by saturation
spectroscopy in a second strontium heatpipe [8]. The red
beam is mode-matched to the 461 nm MOT beam and it
is overlapped to it on a dichroic mirror. From this point
the two beams share the same broad-band optics up to
the atoms.

As discussed in the following, the atoms leak from the
blue MOT to the metastable 3P2 due to the 2 × 10−5
branching ratio of the 1P1 excited state to the low-lying
1D2 and the subsequent decay to the 3P2 state. This loss

2

channel is eliminated with a single optical pumping pro-
cess which involves the 3P2−3D2 transition at 497 nm.
For this purpose we developed an anti-reﬂection coated
laser-diode stabilized in the Littrow ECL conﬁguration
which delivers 25 mW at 994 nm. This light is frequency
doubled on a 17 mm long KNbO3 crystal placed in a res-
onant cavity for improved conversion eﬃciency resulting
in 4 mW at 497 nm. The KNbO3 is b-cut for non-critical
phase matching at a temperature of 54◦C. The 497 nm
beam is sent to the MOT region with a 1.5 cm e−2 di-
ameter, it is retroreﬂected, and its frequency is tuned in
order to maximize the blue MOT ﬂuorescence.

Without the 497 nm repumper the blue MOT lifetime
is limited to 10 ms and typically we trap 107 88Sr atoms
at 3 mK. By applying the green repumper the blue MOT
lifetime increases by more than one order of magnitude,
resulting in up to 3 × 108 atoms loaded into the 88Sr blue
MOT at a density of 6×109 cm−3. These values are com-
parable to the alternative optical pumping scheme [22] in
which two lasers at 707 and 679 nm couple the 5p 3P2 and
the 5p 3P0 states to the 6s 3S1 state (see ﬁgure 1).

As described in [1], the transfer from the blue to the
red MOT is done in two steps: For the ﬁrst 200 ms the
red laser is frequency modulated at 50 kHz, spanning
2 MHz (FM red MOT), to recapture the atoms moving
faster than the capture velocity on the 1S0-3P1transition.
In the following 40 ms the red laser is set single frequency
at the intensity that determines the desired ﬁnal temper-
ature of the sample. Working at 350 kHz below reso-
nance and reducing the total light intensity on the MOT
to 70 µW/cm2, we obtain about 10% of the initial atoms
from the blue MOT cooled below 1 µK.

For simultaneous trapping of multiple isotopic samples
previous experiments employed laser sources delivering
the necessary frequency components for each isotope in-
volved [14, 15]. This approach in the case of the blue
MOT may be diﬃcult to apply because of the complex-
ity of the laser sources, the limited optical access, the
frequency oﬀsets involved, and the limited laser power.
An alterative solution is presented by the use of the mag-
netically trapped 3P2 state as a dark atom reservoir [23].
During the blue MOT phase without the repumper, the
small branching ratio of the excited 1P1 state towards
the metastable 3P2 state, provides a continuous loading
of atoms into the potential given by the MOT’s magnetic
quadrupole [24]. Figure 2 reports the lifetime of the mag-
netically trapped metastable isotopes. Then, using the
same blue source, one can sequentially load diﬀerent iso-
topes into the magnetic potential just by stepping the
laser frequency to the diﬀerent resonances.

The trapping sequence for collection of a 88Sr-86Sr mix-
ture is reported in Figure 3. We start collecting 86Sr for
3 s, then we tune the blue laser on resonance to 88Sr
for 2 s. Once the isotopic mixture is prepared in the
3P2 state, the blue light is switched oﬀ, and the FM
red MOT is switched on as well as the repumping beam.
The isotopic shift on the repumping transition is smaller
than the resonance width of the 3P2-3D2 transition ob-

served on the blue MOT ﬂuorescence, which results in ef-
ﬁcient, simultaneous optical pumping of 88Sr and 86Sr on
a timescale short with respect to red MOT capture time
[25]. The loading of a single isotope into the magnetic
potential was already described in [24] and we did not
observe signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the behavior when load-
ing two isotopes. Figure 2 shows the measurement of the
lifetime for each isotope, both when individually trapped
and in presence of the blue MOT working on the other
isotope. All the lifetimes are on the order of 5 s, close to
the background pressure limited lifetime of 8 s.

The laser source for the operation of the two-isotope
red MOT is composed of two slave lasers injected from
the same frequency-stabilized master with a frequency
oﬀset corresponding to the isotopic shift of 163 817.3 kHz
[8]. Subsequently, the frequency and the intensity of the
two beams are controlled by double pass AOMs driven by
the same RF, the beams are superimposed on a polarizing
beam splitter, and then they are overlapped to the blue
MOT beams as described previously.

Comparing the two-isotope red MOT with the single
isotope one, with the same atom numbers we do not ob-
serve any eﬀect in the transfer eﬃciency and ﬁnal tem-
perature due to the presence of the second isotope. In
this way, we obtain samples with up to 107 (106) atoms of
88Sr (86Sr) at a temperature 2 µK (1 µK). We attribute
the diﬀerence in the loading with respect to the natural
abundances to minor diﬀerences in the red MOT param-
eters. By varying the order of loading and the loading
times of the two isotopes we can vary almost arbitrarily
the ﬁnal ratio of populations.

The cloud is then transferred into a FORT realized by
focusing a far detuned 922 nm laser beam on the center
of the trap. For this application we employ a semicon-
ductor tapered ampliﬁer seeded from the same 922 nm
source used for the 461 nm laser. At this wavelength,
setting the optical ﬁeld polarization orthogonal to the
magnetic ﬁeld, the diﬀerential stark shift between the
1S0 and 3P1 levels is small with respect to the transition
linewidth, allowing precision spectroscopy and laser cool-
ing even on optically conﬁned atoms [26]. The light from
the ampliﬁer is spatially ﬁltered through a polarization-

maintaining single-mode optical ﬁber and is focused on
the atoms to a waist of 15 µm. At maximum power, we
measure the radial oscillation frequency νrad=2 kHz and
the axial oscillation frequency νax=26 Hz. These values
are consistent with our peak intensity of 160 KW/cm2
which corresponds to a trap depth of 90 µK.

As shown in ﬁgure 3, the transfer between the 1S0-
3P1 MOT and the FORT is done by adding the 922 nm
light 60 ms before switching oﬀ the MOT. Figure 4 shows
the transfer of the mixture from the red MOT to the
FORT as a function of the overlap time. The loading
dynamics of 86Sr is slightly faster than for 88Sr while the
losses at overlap time longer than 100 ms are attributed
to the balance of light assisted collisions [1]. The maxi-
mum transfer eﬃciency of 40 % is observed by overlap-
ping the FORT beam waist on the red MOT, and then
displacing the the FORT waist 500 µm in the direction
of the FORT beam. This displacement corresponds to
2/3 of Rayleigh range, or equivalently 2 red MOT e−2
radii. The eﬀects of this displacement are the increase of
the overlap volume between the ﬁnal red MOT and the
FORT, and the reduction of the light assisted collisional
losses at the bottom of the dipole potential. Finally we
load into the FORT up to 3 105 (106) atoms typically
at 15 µK (20 µK) for the individual 86Sr (88Sr) isotope.
The diﬀerence in the ﬁnal temperature is in agreement
with the density dependent heating reported in [1]. When
loading the isotopic mixture we do not observe any re-
duction of the transfer eﬃciency from the red MOT into
the FORT. Surprisingly in the optical trap we always ﬁnd
thermal equilibrium among the two species. The inter-
species thermalization is fast on the timescale of the load-
ing into the FORT and allows us to set a lower bound for
the inter-species elastic cross section σ > 3.5×10−12 cm2.
Equivalently, the modulus of the inter-species scattering
σ
length is |a| = p
8π > 70 Bohr radii.

In conclusion we presented the simultaneous cooling
and trapping of the 88Sr and 86Sr isotopes into a MOT
operating on the spin-forbidden 1S0-3P1 transition, and
we described the transfer of the mixture into a conserva-

(cid:13)

tive, far-oﬀ resonant, dipole trap working near the “magic
wavelength” for the 1S0-3P1 transition [26]. The method,
which is demonstrated with strontium isotopes, can be
applied to all the atoms with similar level structure and
transitions, to load an arbitrarily large number of iso-
topes. The realization of the strontium isotopic mix-
ture and the observed strong inter-species thermaliza-
tion will allow the implementation of additional cooling
mechanisms based sympathetic cooling. This seems very
promising towards the realization of a Bose-Einstein con-
densate of an alkali-earth atom.

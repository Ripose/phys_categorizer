We use coherent backscattering (CBS) of light by cold Strontium atoms to study the mutual co-
herence of light waves in the multiple scattering regime. As the probe light intensity is increased, the
atomic optical transition starts to be saturated. Nonlinearities and inelastic scattering then occur.
In our experiment, we observe a strongly reduced enhancement factor of the coherent backscatter-
ing cone when the intensity of the probe laser is increased, indicating a partial loss of coherence in
multiple scattering.

Wave coherence in the multiple scattering regime is
a key ingredient to reveal the impact of interference on
wave transport in strongly scattering media, with spe-
cial interest in photonic crystals [1], random lasers [2],
strong and weak localization [3, 4]. It has been shown
that wave coherence has some robust features which sur-
vive the spatial conﬁguration average. A clean illustra-
tion is given by the coherent backscattering phenomenon
(CBS)[5, 6], a random two-wave zero path length interfer-
ometer. CBS manifests itself as an enhanced diﬀuse re-
ﬂection peak in the backscattering direction. This signal
is related to the Fourier transform of the conﬁguration-
averaged two-ﬁeld correlation function (the mutual co-
herence) at two space-time points at the surface of the
medium [7]. Hence the enhancement factor α (the peak
to background ratio) provides a simple measure of spa-
tial coherence properties of the disordered system after
spatial averaging. For perfect contrast, α takes its max-
imal value of two, a symmetry property bearing on reci-
procity [8]. In recent experiments, we have studied CBS
in the elastic scattering regime with cold atomic vapours
exposed to low intensity quasi-resonant monochromatic
light. We have evidenced a loss of contrast due to the
internal structure of atoms [9, 10, 11] and a full contrast
restoration when non-degenerate atoms are used [12].

Studying optical wave transport and localization ef-
fects with cold atoms oﬀer several advantages. Indeed,
they act as ideal point-like scatterers, where the scat-
tering matrix can be fully described with ab initio cal-
culations and no adjustable parameters. Moreover, the
presence of sharp resonances results in large scattering
cross-sections, easily tunable by few orders of magnitude,
and large associated time scales, making resonant scat-
tering systems diﬀerent from non-resonant multiple scat-
tering studied so far.
If strong driving ﬁelds are used,
atoms exhibit unusual scattering properties. First the
atomic susceptibility shows up a dependence on the local
ﬁeld intensity. This non linearity alters both scatter-
ing (nonlinear reduction of the scattering cross-section)
and propagation (generation of a nonlinear refractive in-
dex for the eﬀective medium). Second, in addition to

the usual elastic component, atoms radiate an inelastic
spectrum component. For resonantly driven atoms with
a non-degenerate groundstate, a characteristic frequency
width of this spectrum is Γ (inverse of the excited-state
lifetime) [13]. This inelastic spectrum is a direct conse-
quence of the vacuum-induced ﬂuctuations of the driven
atomic dipole. At very strong ﬁelds, this results in the
celebrated Mollow triplet [13, 14]. An important ques-
tion is whether the interference eﬀects surviving the spa-
tial average are aﬀected by these non linearities and by
these quantum ﬂuctuations of the atomic dipole. Theo-
retical studies investigating the impact of χ(2) [15] and
χ(3) [16] nonlinearities predict no CBS reduction. This
seems to be supported by experimental work on CBS in
gain medium [17]. On contrary, phase ﬂuctuations dur-
ing scattering are potential sources of a loss of coherence
and a CBS contrast reduction. These dephasing phenom-
ena, well known in electron transport [18], appear to be
eﬀective as soon as their correlation times are shorter
than the wave transport time inside the medium. With
resonant scatterers like atoms, the transport time can
be very long [19], of the same order or even longer than
the correlation time τ ≃ 1/Γ of vaccuum-induced dipole
ﬂuctuations. One may thus expect the same kind of deco-
herence mechanisms with atoms than for electrons with
an added complexity coming from the resonant charac-
ter of the scattering process. This new ingredient will
induce frequency ﬁltering [20] and tunability in strength
and shape of the inelastic spectrum.

In this letter, we report the ﬁrst experimental evi-
dence of a reduced CBS contrast on an optically thick
cold atomic strontium cloud when strong driving ﬁelds
are used. The experimental setup has been described
elsewhere [12]. Typical ﬂuorescence measurements in-
dicate that about 7 107 atoms, at a temperature of
1mK, are trapped in a quasi-Gaussian spherical cloud
with rms-size about 0.7mm. This corresponds to a typ-
ical atomic density at the center of the cloud about
n ≃ 1010atoms/cm3. With these parameters kℓ ≈ 104
(k is the incoming wavevector and ℓ the light scattering
mean free path) and scattering occurs in the weak local-

ization regime. The maximal optical thickness achieved
in our system, as deduced from coherent transmission
measurements at low input intensity, is b = 3.5, in rea-
sonable agreement with the cloud size and number of
atoms.

The CBS experiment procedure uses the following time
sequence. First, the MOT is loaded during 28ms (93%
of the duty cycle). Then the trapping beams and the
magnetic gradient are switched oﬀ (typical falling time
1µs for the lasers and 100µs for the magnetic ﬁeld). The
residual magnetic ﬁeld is less than 1G making the Zee-
man splitting small compared to the linewidth Γ. Once
the MOT is turned oﬀ, a resonant probe laser is switched
on for a short period of time. In the present study, the
probe laser parameters (intensity and frequency) are var-
ied. The probe pulse duration is adjusted accordingly
(typically from 5 to 70µs) to keep the maximum num-
ber of absorbed photons per atom below 400.
In this
way, mechanical eﬀects will be negligible throughout the
experiments since 400kvrec/Γ ≈ 0.3, where vrec is the
atomic recoil velocity associated with the absorption of
a single photon. Finally, most of the atoms are recap-
tured during the next MOT sequence. The collimated
CBS probe laser (beam waist 2mm) and the response
function of our detection system yield an angular reso-
lution well described by a Gaussian convolution with a
width ≈ 0.06mrad, suﬃciently below the typical CBS
angular width (0.3mrad). Wave plates and polarizing
optical components are used to select the polarization of
the incident probe beam and of the detected backward
ﬂuorescence. All measurements presented in this paper
have been performed in the helicity preserving channel
(hkh). In this channel single scattering is rejected and
an enhancement factor of two is predicted and observed
at low light intensity [12]. However, since the channel iso-
lation is not perfect in the experiment, single scattering
will spoil the signal. This happens preferentially at low
optical thickness because single scattering has the largest
contribution to the total backscattered signal. For our
experiments this eﬀect leads to an enhancement factor
reduction of few percents.

The principle of the CBS detection scheme has been
described in ref.
[21]. The far-ﬁeld backward ﬂuores-
cence signal is collected on a cooled CCD Camera. A
mechanical chopper is placed between the MOT and the
CCD. It is synchronized with the full time sequence in
order to close the detection path when the MOT is op-
erating and to open it when the probe beam is switched
on. The total exposure time required for good signal-to-
noise ratio is of the order of a few seconds. Once the full
signal is collected, the acquisition is repeated during the
same amount of time, maintaining the MOT magnetic
gradient oﬀ, to obtain the background signal. This stray
signal, corresponding to 15% of the total signal, is then
subtracted to get the CBS signal. A 2D ﬁtting procedure
is then used to extract the main CBS cone parameters, its

width and its enhancement factor. The theoretical shape
of the CBS cone implemented in the ﬁtting procedure is
given by a Monte-Carlo simulation performed at low sat-
uration but taking into account the Gaussian distribution
of atoms in a cloud [12]. Increasing the probe beam in-
tensity did not reveal any signiﬁcant change in the shape
of the CBS cone, at least in the range of parameters used
in our experiment. This is the reason why we treat all
the data with the same cone shape. The ﬁnite angular
resolution of our apparatus has been taken into account
by convolving the preceding theoretical CBS cone shape
by a Gaussian having the measured apparatus angular
width.

Beyond the complexity of the situation under consid-
eration (multiple scattering with nonlinear and inelastic
scatterers), one has to deal also with nonuniform scat-
tering properties. Indeed, even in an homogeneous slab
geometry, the local intensity is not constant, as the inci-
dent coherent beam is attenuated when penetrating into
the medium. Hence the atoms located deeper inside the
medium will not be saturated in the same way as the
atoms on the front part of the sample. Thus the sat-
uration, and hence the scattering cross-section, will not
be constant along a given multiple scattering path. The
importance of the spatial variation of the saturation pa-
rameter can be estimated by looking at the attenuation
of the coherent beam. In Fig. 1 we report the measured
transmission and we compare it with the Lambert-Beer
theoretical prediction taking into account the non-linear
reduction of the cross-section. If one assumes that the lo-
cal atomic saturation is dominated by the incident ﬁeld
and not by the scattered ﬁeld, this theoretical curve is
obtained by solving the following equation:

Here s is the saturation parameter deﬁned as:

ds
dz

=

s
(1 + s)ℓ

s =

I/Isat
1 + (2δ/Γ)2

where Isat is the saturation intensity (Isat = 42mW/cm2
for Sr) and where δ is the laser detuning with respect
to the atomic transition. The factor 1/(1 + s) features
the non-linear reduction of the scattering eﬃciency and
one gets the normal Lambert-Beer law when s → 0. The
low-intensity scattering mean free path ℓ reads :

ℓ(δ) =

1
nσ(δ)

=

(1 + (2δ/Γ)2
nσ0

with the resonant low-intensity scattering cross-section
σ0 = 3λ2/2π. The excellent agreement with the mea-
sured attenuation prooves that saturation plays a role in
our experimental conditions (since otherwise the trans-
mission would not depend on s) and that the local atomic
saturation is indeed dominated by the incident ﬁeld.

Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the CBS enhancement
factor as a function of the incident saturation parameter
s, with the probe maintained at resonance (δ = 0). In
principle one would like to vary the saturation parameter
without modifying the relative weight of the various scat-
tering orders involved in the CBS signal. This however
proves to be diﬃcult to assure because of the modiﬁca-
tion of the atom scattering properties when s increases.
In order to minimize any eﬀect relating to a modiﬁca-
tion of the distribution of scattering orders, we tried to
keep the coherent beam proﬁle throughout the sample as
constant as possible. This is achieved by adjusting, for
each value of s, the total number of cold atoms in the
cloud in order to maintain the coherent transmission T
as constant as possible (T ≃ 0.085 in the data shown in
Fig. 2). As shown in Fig.2 we observe an enhancement
factor of 1.93 ± 0.02 at low saturation. The small sys-
tematic reduction of α compared to the expected value
of two is in agreement with the presence of residual single
scattering in the forbidden hkh polarization channel, as
we previously discussed. The most striking feature is the
rapid quasi-linear decrease of the enhancement factor as
s is increased. The slope derived from a rms-procedure
is (δα/δs) ≈ −0.6. As the transmission is kept ﬁxed, we
estimate numerically the fraction of single scattering to
increase by less than 10% when the saturation parame-
ter is increased up to s = 0.8. The associated reduction
of the enhancement factor should be of the order of 1%,
negligible compared to the observed reduction. Thus the
CBS reduction comes from the multiple scattering signal.
In order to see to what extent the resonance aﬀects
the coherence properties probed by CBS, we performed
another experiment at δ = Γ/2. The same experimen-
tal procedure has been used with a transmission now at
T = 0.19. As shown in Fig. 3 a diﬀerent general behavior
is observed. First, at low intensity, the linear decreas-
ing is faster since (δα/δs) ≈ −1.8. Second, for larger
saturation parameters (0.3 < s < 0.8) the decrease is
then slowed down. The two sets of data in Fig.2 and
3 are obtained with a diﬀerent transmission value, but
other studies show that the enhancement factor does not
sensitively depend on the transmission value. So, if we
compare these data, it shows that s is not the only rel-

shape of the inelastic spectrum also depends on the de-
tuning δ.
In particular, for the detuned case, part of
the inelastic spectrum will overlap the atomic resonance.
This resonant inelastic light will thus be scattered again
more eﬃciently then the oﬀ-resonant elastic part. This
eﬀect is e.g. responsible for an increase of the MOT vol-
ume in the multiple scattering regime [22]. Finally in
our experiment, the ratio inelastic versus elastic multiple
scattered light may change with the detuning. We may
then conclude that the CBS reduction is due to the in-
elastic spectrum, but one has also to keep in mind that
the dispersive aspect of the atomic response to a driv-

ing ﬁeld implies that non linearities at propagation and
at scattering are drastically diﬀerent for on-resonant and
detuned excitations.

In summary, we observed that coherent backscattering
is strongly reduced when the atomic transition is satu-
rated, a signature of the wave coherence loss in the mul-
tiple scattering regime. We speculate that the origin of
this reduction is due to the inelastic scattering of the
light by the atoms, i.e. from the coupling of the atomic
dipole to the vacuum modes of the ﬁeld rather than to
the non-linear response of the atomic dipole. The diﬀer-
ent behavior of the CBS enhancement factor for resonant
and oﬀ-resonant excitations (see Fig. 2 and 3) indicates
that the saturation parameter s alone does not allow for
an universal scaling. It is important to realize that, in the
quest of strong localization of light in disordered medium,
large local build-up of the intensity can occur in the lo-
calized states. If the localization length is of the order
of few optical wavelength, a single resonant photon could
in principle saturate the atoms located in that region, in
analogy with cavity QED eﬀects [23]. The observations
reported in this letter are thus important for the study
of strong localization of light in atomic vapours.

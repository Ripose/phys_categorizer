Abstract

The complete gauge-invariant set of the one-loop QED corrections to the parity-nonconserving (PNC)

amplitude in cesium and francium is evaluated to all orders in αZ using a local form of the Dirac-Fock

potential. The calculations are performed in both length and velocity gauges for the absorbed photon and

the total binding QED correction is found to be

0.27(3)% for Cs and

0.28(5)% for Fr. Moreover, a high-

−

−

precision calculation of the electron-correlation and Breit-interaction effects on the 7s-8s PNC amplitude

in francium using a large-scale conﬁguration-interaction Dirac-Fock method is performed. The obtained

results are employed to improve the theoretical predictions for the PNC transition amplitude in Cs and Fr.

Using an average value from two most accurate measurements of the vector transition polarizability, the

weak charge of 133Cs is derived to amount to QW =

72.65(29)exp(36)theor. This value deviates by 1.1σ

−
from the prediction of the standard model. The values of the 7s-8s PNC amplitude in 223Fr and 210Fr are

obtained to be

15.49(15) and

14.16(14), respectively, in units of i

INTRODUCTION

Measurements of the parity nonconservation (PNC) effects in atoms provide sensitive tests of

the standard model (SM) and impose constraints on physics beyond it [1, 2]. The 6s-7s PNC

amplitude in 133Cs [3] remains one of the most effective tool for such investigations. The mea-

surement of this amplitude to a 0.3% accuracy [4, 5] has stimulated a reanalysis of the theoretical

predictions given in Refs. [6, 7, 8]. First, it was found [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] that the role of the Breit

interaction had been underestimated. Then, it was pointed out [14] that the QED corrections may

be comparable with the Breit corrections. The numerical evaluation of the vacuum-polarization

(VP) correction [15] led to a 0.4% increase of the 6s-7s PNC amplitude in 133Cs, which resulted

in a 2.2σ deviation of the weak charge of 133Cs from the SM prediction. This has triggered a great

interest to calculations of the complete one-loop QED corrections to the PNC amplitude.

While the VP contribution can easily be evaluated to a high accuracy within the Uehling ap-

proximation, the calculation of the self-energy (SE) contribution is a much more demanding prob-

lem (here and below we imply that the SE term embraces all one-loop vertex diagrams as well).

In the plane wave approximation, that corresponds to zeroth order in αZ, it was derived in Refs.

[16, 17]. This correction, whose relative value equals to

α/(2π), is commonly included in the

−

deﬁnition of the nuclear weak charge. The αZ-dependent part of the SE correction to the PNC

matrix element between s and p states was evaluated in Refs. [18, 19]. These calculations, which

are exact to ﬁrst order in αZ and partially include higher-order binding effects, yield the binding

SE correction of

0.9(1)% [18, 20] and

0.85% [19]. The corresponding total binding QED cor-

rection was found to amount to

0.43%, respectively. Despite this restored agreement

with SM, the status of the QED correction to PNC in 133Cs could not be considered as resolved

−

−
0.5% and

−

−

until a complete αZ-dependence calculation of the SE correction to the 6s-7s transition amplitude

is accomplished. This is due to the following reasons. First, in case of cesium (Z = 55) the pa-

rameter αZ

0.4 is not small and, therefore, the higher-order corrections, which are beyond the

≈

A(αZ)ln(λC/Rnuc) term [19], can be signiﬁcant. Second, because the calculations [18, 19, 20]

are performed for the PNC matrix element only, they do not include other SE diagrams which

contribute to the 6s-7s transition amplitude. For instance, these calculations do not account for di-

agrams in which the virtual photon embraces both the weak interaction and the absorbed photon.

Third, strictly speaking, the PNC matrix element between the states of different energies is not

gauge invariant. Despite the gauge-dependent part is suppressed by the small energy difference

2

[19], estimates of the uncertainty in the deﬁnition of the PNC diagrams may fail due to unphysical

origin of the gauge-dependent terms.

The ﬁrst step towards a complete αZ-dependence calculation of the SE correction was done

in Ref. [21], where the SE correction to the 2s-2p1/2 PNC matrix element in H-like ions was

evaluated. This matrix element was chosen to deal with the simpliﬁed gauge-invariant amplitude.

The results of that work agree with those of Refs. [18, 19, 20]. However, as was stressed there, no

claims can be made about the applicability of these results to the 6s-7s PNC transition in neutral

cesium.

Finally, the whole gauge-invariant set of the one-loop QED corrections to the 6s-7s PNC transi-

tion amplitude in cesium was evaluated in Ref. [22]. This calculation showed that the contributions

of all SE diagrams are of the same order of magnitude (in both length and velocity gauges) and

the ﬁnal result arises through a delicate cancellation of individual terms, none of which can be

neglected. The binding SE correction was obtained to amount to

0.67(3)% whereas the total

−

binding QED correction is

0.27(3)%.

−

Recently, the one-loop radiative corrections to the 6s-7s PNC amplitude in cesium were reeval-

uated by a semi-empirical method [23]. In addition to the radiative correction to the weak matrix

element, this method accounts for the related corrections to the energy levels and to the electric

dipole (E1) amplitude. Despite it is intended to incorporate the radiative and correlation effects, it

is unclear how the results obtained by this method are related to those derived in the framework of

the rigorous QED approach. The total binding QED correction obtained in Ref. [23] amounts to

0.32(3)%.

−

In the present paper we describe in detail the complete αZ-dependence evaluation of the one-

loop QED corrections to the PNC transition amplitude in alkaline atoms and present the corre-

sponding numerical results for the 6s-7s PNC amplitude in cesium [22] and for the 7s-8s PNC

amplitude in francium, which is going to be a subject of the PNC experiment, as proposed in Ref.

[24]. Moreover, we perform a high-precision atomic structure calculation of the PNC transition

amplitude in francium using a large-scale conﬁguration-interaction Dirac-Fock (CI-DF) method

and compare the results with those from Refs. [25, 26]. The obtained contributions are combined

with other terms to improve the theoretical predictions for the PNC transition amplitudes in Cs

and Fr.

II. QED CORRECTIONS

A. Formulation

A systematic derivation of the QED corrections in a fully relativistic approach requires the use

of perturbation theory starting with a one-electron approximation in an effective local potential

V (r)

iα

(

−

·

∇ + βm + V (x))ψn(x) = εnψn(x) .

(1)

In neutral atoms, it is assumed that V (r) includes the interaction with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the

nucleus as well as partly the electron-electron interaction. The interaction of the electrons with the

quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld and the correlation effects are accounted for by the perturbation

theory. In this way we obtain quantum electrodynamics in the Furry picture.

To derive formal expressions for the transition amplitude we employ the method developed in

Ref. [27] and described in detail in Ref. [28]. While this method is valid for arbitrary many-

electron atom and for arbitrary (single, degenerate, and quasidegenerate) initial and ﬁnal states, its

formulation is especially simple for a one-electron atom (or an atom with one electron over the

closed shells) and for the case of single initial and ﬁnal states.

We consider the transition of the atom from the initial state a (which is 6s for Cs and 7s for Fr)

to the ﬁnal state b (which is 7s for Cs and 8s for Fr) accompanied by the absorption of a photon
, and polarization ǫν = (0, ǫ). The transition amplitude is

We note here that the case of degenerate levels, which takes place for the pure Coulomb potential,

can be considered employing the related formulas from Ref. [28].

The one-loop SE corrections to the PNC transition amplitude are deﬁned by diagrams presented

in Fig. 2. To derive the formal expressions for these corrections, one has to expand formula (2) to

the next-to-leading order:

It can be shown that the sum of contributions (43)-(46) is the same in the length and the velocity

gauge. Because of the gauge invariance of the total SE correction, the same is valid for the sum of

the other terms, Eqs. (35)-(42) and (47).

11

Formulas (35)-(47) contain ultraviolet and infrared divergences. To cancel the ultraviolet di-

vergences, we expand contributions (35)-(40) into zero-, one-, and many-potential terms and con-

tributions (41)-(44) into zero- and many-potential terms. The ultraviolet divergencies are present

only in the zero- and one-potential terms. They are removed analytically by calculating these

terms in the momentum space (for details, we refer to Refs. [29, 30, 31]). For the standard zero-

and one-potential terms we employ the equations given in Ref. [30] whereas the corresponding

expression for the zero-potential PNC term is presented in the Appendix. The many-potential

terms are evaluated in conﬁguration space employing the Wick rotation in the complex ω plane.

The infrared divergences, which occur in contributions (35)-(38) and (45)-(46), are regularized by

introducing a nonzero photon mass and cancelled analytically.

The expressions for the VP corrections, which do not contain any insertions with the external

photon line or the weak interaction attached to the electron loop, are obtained from Eqs. (35)-(40)

by the replacement of the SE operator with the VP potential. The other VP corrections will not

be considered here, since their contribution is negligible. To a high accuracy, the VP potential is

determined by the Uehling term, which corresponds to ﬁrst nonzero term in the expansion of the

vacuum loop in powers of the Coulomb potential. The renormalized expression for the Uehling

potential is

potential, so-called Wichmann-Kroll term, can be evaluated for the point-charge nucleus using

approximate formulas derived in Ref. [32].

B. Local Dirac-Fock potential

Since the energy intervals between the levels 6s, 6p1/2, 7s, and 7p1/2 in Cs and the levels 7s,

7p1/2, 8s, and 8p1/2 in Fr are very small, to get reliable results for the transition amplitudes under

consideration, one needs to use a local potential V (r) that reproduces energies and wave functions

12

of these states on the Dirac-Fock (DF) accuracy level or better. We construct such a potential by

inverting the radial Dirac equation with the radial wave function obtained by solving the DHF

equation with the code of Ref. [33].

The radial DF equations have the form [33]

In contrast to the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation, generally speaking, it is impossible to

m Fa = εa Fa .

(cid:18)

choose such a local potential Va(r) which would exactly reproduce the one-electron energy εa and

the radial components Ga and Fa for a given shell. This is due to the fact that the potential Va(r)

enters both radial equations. However, one can derive an approximate potential by inverting the

radial Dirac equation for the large component:

Despite the potential V (1)

To smooth the potential V (1)

(r) in the core region, we use the following procedure. Instead of

the density ρa, we consider an average density ρa deﬁned by

(54)

(55)

ρnaκa =

wnκa ρnκa ,

wnκa = 1 ,

Xn≤na

where wnκa are positive weights. Thus, the density ρnaκa gets some admixture of the densities of

the core shells corresponding to the same value of κa but different values of the principal quantum

number n < na. Since the maximal values of the core shell densities are located nearby the nodes

of the function Ga, the density ρnaκa can be made to be smooth and nodeless by a proper choice of
the weights wnκa. Outside the core region the densities ρnaκa and ρnaκa are almost coincide with
each other. This is due to a fast decrease of the core wave functions outside the core. Assuming

the nonlocal part of the DF potential can be replaced by a local potential which is the same for all

the experimental ones. The corresponding comparision for the francium atom, where the local

potential was derived using mainly the DF wave function of the 7s state, is presented in Table II.

C. Numerical evaluation of the QED corrections

Numerical evaluation of expressions (34)-(47) was performed by employing the dual-kinetic-

balance ﬁnite basis set method [42] with basis functions construced from B-splines. The cal-

culation of the zeroth-order contribution (34), with V (r) constructed as indicated above, yields

These values should be compared with the corresponding DHF values,

15.72 for 223Fr (see the next section). The individual SE corrections are presented in Table III.

Since there is a signiﬁcant cancellation between terms containing the infrared singularities, the

Table III, contains also the free term,

PNC = δEtot

amounts to

−

PNC + α/(2π)EPNC. According to our calculations, the binding SE correction
1.29% for francium. To estimate the uncertainty of these

0.67% for cesium and

values due to correlation effects, we have also performed the calculations with V (r) constructed

−

−

employng the DF wave function of the 7s state for cesium and the 8s state for francium. While

this leads to a 2% decrease of the transition amplitude, the relative shift of the SE correction is,

however, ﬁve times smaller. Since the correlation effects contribute to the transition amplitude

on the 20% level, we assume a 4% uncertainty for the total SE correction. Therefore, our value

for the binding SE correction is

0.67(3)% for cesium and

1.29(5)% for francium. In case of

−

−

cesium, our value differs from the previous evaluations of the SE effect, which are

0.9(1)% [20]

and

0.85% [19].

−
We have also calculated the VP correction. The individual contributions for the Uehling part,

calculated including the screening correction as described after equation (49), are presented in

Table IV. The total Uehling correction is almost independent of the screening effect and amounts

to 0.410% for cesium and 1.037% for francium. These results agree well with the previous calcu-

lations of this correction. The individual contributions for the Wichmann-Kroll (WK) correction,

obtained employing approximate formulas for the WK potential from Ref. [32], are given in Table

V. The total WK correction is equal to

0.004% (cf. [13]) for cesium and

0.028% for francium.

−

This leads to the 0.406% result for the total VP correction for cesium and to the 1.01% result

for francium. Therefore, the total binding QED correction amounts to

0.27(3)% for cesium and

−

−

0.28(5)% for francium.

III. ELECTRON CORRELATION EFFECT ON THE PNC TRANSITION AMPLITUDE

tonian in the no-pair approximation:

Hnp = Λ+HΛ+ ,

H =

hD(j) + V int

C + V int
B ,

(57)

Xj

where hD is the one-electron Dirac Hamiltonian, the index j = 1, ...N enumerates the electrons,

and V int

C and V int

B are the Coulomb and the Breit electron-electron interaction operator, respec-

tively. The frequency independent Breit interaction in the Coulomb gauge is given by

Here V int

is the projector on the positive-energy states, which is the product of the one-electron projectors

hu un = εn un ,

which can be taken to be the Dirac Hamiltonian hD, the Dirac Hamiltonian in an external ﬁeld or

the DF Hamiltonian in an external ﬁeld [43, 44, 45].

To calculate the EPNC amplitude, we add the weak interaction to the full Hamiltonian:

H(µ) = H + µ

HW (j) ,

Xj

where HW is deﬁned by Eq. (11).

With the PNC interaction added to the one-electron DF Hamiltonian, one obtains the coupled

equations, which are usually referred to as the PNC-HF equations [46]. The linearization of these

equations with respect to the parameter µ would make them inhomogeneous. Since in our calcula-

tions we do not perform such a linearization, the equations remain homogeneous. In this case the

16

PNC amplitude can be calculated using the equation

EPNC =

Ψf (µ)

iiµ=0

where D =

i eri is the dipole moment operator and Ψi and Ψf are the many-electron wave

functions of the initial and ﬁnal states, respectively. They obey the equations

P

H(µ) Ψi(µ) = Ei(µ) Ψi(µ) ,

H(µ) Ψf (µ) = Ef (µ) Ψf (µ) .

(64)

The many-electron wave functions Ψi and Ψf are represented by a large number of the conﬁgura-

tion state functions (CSFs):

(63)

(65)

ΨJM (µ) =

Cα(µ) ΦJM

α (µ) .

Xα

The CSFs ΦJM

α

are linear combinations of the Slater determinants, which are constructed from the

one-electron wave functions un(µ). Expansion (65) contains the CFSs of different parity, since

the weak interaction is included in the Hamiltonian H(µ).

The one-electron functions un(µ) are obtained as eigenfunctions of the Dirac-Fock operator in

the external ﬁeld:

hu(µ) un(µ) = εn(µ) un(µ) ,

hu(µ) = hDF(µ) + µ HW .

(66)

It should be noted that the Dirac-Fock operator hDF(µ) depends on the parameter µ, since the

one-particle density matrix is constructed from occupied orbitals un(µ). We can also consider the

set of one-electron wave functions u0

n(µ) deﬁned by equations

u(µ) u0
h0

n(µ) = ε0

n(µ) u0

n(µ) ,

h0
u(µ) = hDF(0) + µ HW ,

(67)

where hDF(0) is the standard Dirac-Fock operator without the external ﬁeld.

The PNC amplitude can be calculated in the Hartree-Fock approximation by using only one

CSF in expansion (65). Using equation (63) and the wave functions u0

n(µ), one obtains so-called
Dirac-Fock value of the PNC amplitude. If the set of un(µ) is used, the method, in principle, is

equivalent to the PNC-HF method, which was used by different authors [47, 48, 49].

In the large scale conﬁguration interaction (CI) method the set of the CSFs for given quantum

numbers JM is generated including all single, double, and the most signiﬁcant part of triple

excitations in the positive spectrum of the one-electron states un(µ). In what follows, this method

of evaluation of the PNC amplitude will be referred to as the PNC-CI method.

17

To obtain the set of the one-electron functions un(µ) and u0

n(µ), we solve equations (66) and

(67) using the ﬁnite basis approximation,

un(µ) =

cn
a(µ) ϕa

Xa

with the basis functions ϕa given in the central ﬁeld approximation:

ϕa(r) =

Pa(r) χκama(n)

iQa(r) χ−κama(n)

ila
r







.



(68)

(69)

The representation (69) differs from the standard one by the factor il. This factor is introduced to

make the one-electron matrix elements of the PNC Hamiltonian to be real:

where la + lb + 1 is even. With this one-electron basis, the large scale PNC-CI matrix is also real

and Hermitian.

For the occupied atomic shells, the large Pa and small Qa components of the radial wave

functions are obtained by solving the standard radial DF equations. For the vacant shells the

Dirac-Fock-Sturm equations are used. For details of the Dirac-Fock-Sturm method we refer to

Refs. [45, 50]. The basis set containing the radial functions up to 17s, 16p, 12d, 7f, 5g, and 2h

states was used in the calculations.

distribution

In the calculations of the one-electron PNC matrix elements (70) we used the Fermi nuclear

ρN (r) =

ρ0
1 + e4 ln3 (r−c)/t ,

(71)

where t = 2.3 fm. The parameters c and ρ0 were determined to reproduce the value of the nuclear

mean-square radius RN =

r2

1/2 and the normalization condition for ρN (r).

In Table VI we present the results of our calculations of the PNC amplitude for Rb, Cs, and

Fr. The results obtained by the DF method are given in the third column. Our DF value for the

6s-7s PNC transition in Cs,

0.741, is in a good agreement with the values

0.742 [10] and

−

0.739 [11], which were obtained by the direct summation over the intermediate states. For the

[49]. In the ﬁfth column of the table, we present our PNC-CI values, which include the core-

polarization correlation effects. The uncertainty of these values is estimated to be on the 1% level.

For comparison, the most accurate results by other authors are listed in the sixth column of the

table. In the second column we give the values of the nuclear-mean-square radius RN , which were
used in our calculations. They were obtained by the formula RN = 0.836A1/3 + 0.570 [51]. In

case of Fr, the corresponding results with RN taken from Ref. [52] are also presented.

To calculate the contribution of the frequency independent Breit interaction (BI) to the PNC

amplitude, we included the magnetic V int

R terms in all stages of the calcula-
tions. As the ﬁrst step, the BI was included in the radial Dirac-Fock equations. We will refer this

G and retardation V int

approach to as the Dirac-Fock-Breit (DFB) method. On the second stage, the BI was added to the

Dirac-Fock-Sturm equations and to the Dirac-Fock Hamiltonian hu(µ) in the external ﬁeld (66).

This method of calculation of the PNC amplitude will be called as the PNC-HFB method. Finally,

we added the BI to the many-electron Hamiltonian H(µ) in the external ﬁeld and performed the

large scale CI calculation. This approach will be called as the PNC-CIB method. To estimate the

role of the retardation part of the Breit intaraction, we repeated all the calculations including only

the magnetic (Gaunt) part V int

G of the BI and then took the difference with the PNC amplitude,

which includes the total BI.

In Table VII we present the magnetic Breit δEM

PNC contibutions to
the 6s-7s PNC amplitude in 133Cs and to the 7s-8s PNC amplitude in 223Fr, obtained by different

PNC and retardation Breit δER

methods. The comparison of the total Breit correction to the PNC amplitude with the most accurate

results by other authors are presented in Table VIII. Finally, in case of francium, our PNC-CIB

value amounts to

15.55(16) [RN = 5.658fm] for 223Fr, and
14.21(14) for 210Fr. They are in a fair agreement with the most accurate previous results [26],

15.58(16) [RN = 5.640fm] and

15.41(17) [RN = 5.640fm] for 223Fr and

IV. TOTAL PNC AMPLITUDES

To get the total 6s-7s PNC transition amplitude in 133Cs, we combine the most accurate value

that includes the correlation and Breit effects [13],

0.902(5), with the

0.27(3)% binding QED

−

−

correction, the

0.19(6)% neutron skin correction [12], the

−

malization of QW from the atomic momentum transfer q

0.08% correction due to the renor-

−
30 MeV down to q = 0 [19], and the

∼

0.04% contribution from the electron-electron weak interaction [19, 54]. The analysis of accuracy

19

of the atomic structure PNC calculations [6, 8, 10, 13] is based on calculations of the hyperﬁne

splitting, decay rates, and energy levels. As it was argued in Ref. [19], QED corrections to these

quantities can be neglected on the 0.5% accuracy level. Using the experimental value for EPNC/β

[4] and an average value from two most accurate measurements of the vector transition polariz-

abilty, β = 26.99(5)a3

B [5, 13, 55, 56], we obtain for the weak charge of 133Cs:

QW =

72.65(29)exp(36)th .

−

(72)

This value deviates from the SM prediction of

73.19(13) [57] by 1.1 σ.

In case of francium, combining our PNC-CIB values,

−

In summary, we have calculated the QED correction to the PNC transition amplitude in Cs and

Fr. In addition, we have performed an independent high-precision calculation of the correlation

and Breit interaction effects on the PNC amplitude in Fr. We have derived the weak charge of

133Cs, which deviates by 1.1σ from the SM prediction. Further improvement of atomic tests of

the standard model can be achieved, from theoretical side, by more accurate calculations of the

electron-correlation effects and, from experimental side, by more precise measurements of the

PNC amplitude in cesium or other atomic systems, particularly, in francium [24, 58].

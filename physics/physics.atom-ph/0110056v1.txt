The nuclear recoil correction to the bound-electron g factor in H-like atoms is calculated to ﬁrst
order in m/M and to all orders in αZ. The calculation is performed in the range Z = 1 − 100. A
large contribution of terms of order (αZ)5 and higher is found. Even for hydrogen, the higher-order
correction exceeds the (αZ)4 term, while for uranium it is above the leading (αZ)2 correction.

Recent progress in high-precision measurements of the bound-electron g factor for H-like carbon [1,2] and the
related theoretical investigations [3–11] provide a new independent determination of the electron mass. The accuracy
of this determination presented in [11] is three times better than that of the accepted value for the electron mass [12].
This result can be improved if the theoretical and experimental uncertainties for the g factor are reduced. From the
experimental side, an improvement of the accuracy by an order of magnitude is anticipated in the near future, as well
as an extension of the measurements to higher-Z systems [13]. Investigations of the bound-electron g factor in high-Z
systems are of particular importance since they can provide a new determination of the ﬁne structure constant [8,13],
nuclear magnetic moments [13], and nuclear charge radii. They would also create a good possibility for testing the
magnetic sector of QED in a strong Coulomb ﬁeld. At present, the theoretical uncertainty of the bound-electron g
factor in H-like ions is mainly determined by four factors: a numerical error in evaluation of the QED correction of
ﬁrst order in α, an error caused by employing the αZ expansion for the QED correction of second order in α, an error
resulting from the αZ expansion of the nuclear recoil correction, and, for very heavy ions, an error due to the ﬁnite
nuclear size correction. The main goal of this Letter is to evaluate the nuclear recoil correction to the 1s g factor to all
orders in αZ and, therefore, to eliminate one of the main sources of the uncertainty for the corresponding theoretical
predictions.

As is known [14], in the nonrelativistic limit the recoil correction to the 1s g factor vanishes. The leading relativistic
recoil correction is of order (αZ)2m/M and was evaluated in [15,16] (see also [17] and references therein). General
formulas for the nuclear recoil eﬀect valid to all orders in αZ were derived recently in [9]. These results were conﬁrmed
by Yelkhovsky [10] by employing a diﬀerent method.
In addition, Yelkhovsky presented some arguments for the
assertion that the recoil correction up to order (αZ)4m/M is completely deﬁned by the so-called lower-order term
(which was evaluated analytically in [9] and re-derived in [10]). As a result, in [10] the total theoretical uncertainty for
the g factor in C5+ was reduced to the level of 1.2 × 10−9. This leads to improving the precision of the electron-mass
determination by factor of two. In the present Letter, we numerically evaluate the higher-order contribution to the
recoil correction to all orders in αZ. Our results conﬁrm the statement of [10] that the expansion of this term starts
with (αZ)5. However, we ﬁnd that the (αZ)5 behavior of the higher-order term is a result of a cancellation of terms
of order (αZ)3 and (αZ)4 (see a discussion below), while the argumentation of [10] does not contain any indication
of the appearance of such terms. We also observe that for all H-like atoms in the range Z = 1 − 100 the higher-order
term exceeds the (αZ)4m/M contribution. In particular, for the case of carbon this term is about ﬁve times larger
than the (αZ)4m/M term and by factor of ten exceeds its estimation given in [10].

We consider a H-like atom with a spinless nucleus that is put into the classical homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld,
Acl(r) = [H × r]/2. For simplicity, we assume that H is directed along the z axis. The energy shift of a state a to
ﬁrst order in H and to ﬁrst order in m/M is conveniently written as the sum of the lower-order and the higher-order
term [9,10], ∆E = ∆EL + ∆EH, where (¯h = c = 1 , e < 0)

where S(y) = αZα exp (−yr)/r + iαZ[H, φ(yr)n], H = α · p + βm + V (r) is the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian,
∆ij = εi − εj, and φ(yr) = [exp (−yr)(1 + yr) − 1]/(yr)2. The wave-function correction |δai can be found analytically

2

by the method of generalized virial relations for the Dirac equation [18]. The explicit form for the component of
|δai, that has the same angular quantum numbers as the reference state |ai, is presented in [9] (only this component
contributes to the eﬀect under consideration).

The numerical evaluation of the expressions (5)-(7) was carried out similarly to our previous calculations of the
nuclear recoil correction to the Lamb shift [19–21]. After integration over angles, the ﬁnite basis set method was
used to evaluate inﬁnite summations over the electron spectrum. Basis functions were constructed from B-splines by
employing the procedure proposed in [22]. The integration over y was carried out numerically for equation (7) and
both numerically and analytically for equation (6). We mention large numerical cancellations arising in (6) for very
small Z if the y integration is performed analytically. In this case, numerical integration turns out to be preferable.
The number of B-splines used in actual calculations was varied from 70 to 110. The estimated uncertainty corresponds
to the dependence of the results on grid parameters and the number of splines and integration points.

The correction to the 1s g factor induced by the higher-order term ∆EH is expressed in terms of the function

The corresponding numerical results are presented in Table I. It is noteworthy that the one-transverse-photon and the
two-transverse-photon contribution separately are of the order (αZ)4 for small Z, while their sum exhibits the (αZ)5
behavior. This fact is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 1, where the numerical results for the ratio ∆gH/[(m/M )(αZ)4]
are plotted. We also note that the one-transverse-photon contribution contains terms of order (αZ)3 which are
cancelled when added together. Namely, the part corresponding to the perturbation of the reference state a and the
part corresponding to the perturbation of the electron propagator exhibit the (αZ)3 behavior, when taken separately.
We note that, in contrast to our results, the argumentation of [10], where the same gauge is considered, does not
indicate the appearance of terms of order lower than (αZ)5. For this reason, we can not consider the argumentation
of Yelkhovsky, in the form it is given in [10], as complete. Fitting our numerical results for small Z to the form
P (αZ) = C51 log (αZ) + C50 + αZ(· · ·) yields C51 = −5.3 ± 0.5 and C50 = −6.5 ± 1.0. The uncertainties of the
coeﬃcients were estimated analyzing the dependence of the results on the number of parameters in the ﬁt and the
number of ﬁtting points.

In Table 2 we present the ratios ∆gH/∆g0 and (∆gL − ∆g0)/∆g0, where ∆g0 = (αZ)2m/M is the lowest-order
correction derived in [15,16]. As can be seen from the table, the ∆gH term exceeds (∆gL − ∆g0) for all Z in the range
Z = 1−100. In the case of carbon, ∆gH amounts to 7.7×10−11, which is ten times larger than the uncertainty ascribed
to this term in [10]. However, since this correction is about ten times smaller than the current theoretical uncertainty
due to the binding QED correction, it does not aﬀect the electron-mass prediction of [11]. The higher-order recoil
correction is more important for higher-Z systems, since it grows very rapidly when Z increases. In particular, for
uranium the higher-order recoil correction is even above the (αZ)2m/M term.

In Table 3 we present the individual contributions to the 1s g factor for some H-like ions in the range Z = 6 − 92.
An error ascribed to the Dirac point-nucleus value results from the current uncertainty of the ﬁne structure constant,
1/α = 137.03599976(50) [12]. The uncertainty of the ﬁnite nuclear size correction was estimated as the diﬀerence
between the result obtained with the Fermi model of the nuclear charge distribution and with the homogeneously-
charged-sphere model. The nuclear charge radii were taken from [23,24]. The one-loop QED correction was taken
from [4,5], where it was evaluated numerically to all orders in αZ . The α2 QED correction includes the existing αZ
expansion terms for the QED correction of second order in α [7,8] and the known free-QED terms of higher orders
in α (see, e.g., [6]). Its relative uncertainty was estimated as the ratio of the part of the one-loop QED correction,
that is beyond the (αZ)2 approximation, to the part, that is within the (αZ)2 approximation. The recoil correction
incorporates the total recoil correction of ﬁrst order in m/M , calculated in this work, and the known corrections of
orders (m/M )2 and α(m/M ) [17]. From the table, we conclude that for low Z the theoretical uncertainty is mainly
determined by the numerical error of the one-loop QED correction [5,6], while for high Z it results from the αZ
expansion of the α2 QED correction and from the ﬁnite nuclear size correction. Calculations of the QED corrections
up to the desirable accuracy seem to be feasible in the near future if we consider recent progress in calculations of the
corresponding corrections to the Lamb shift in H-like ions [25,26]. As to the uncertainty due to the ﬁnite nuclear size
eﬀect, one may expect that, like in the case of the hyperﬁne splitting [27], it can be signiﬁcantly reduced in a speciﬁc
diﬀerence of the bound-electron g factor in H- and Li-like ions.

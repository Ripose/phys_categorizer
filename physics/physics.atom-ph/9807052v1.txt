Magnetically trapped neutral atoms can be cooled with the evaporation technique. This is
typically done by using a radiofrequency (rf) ﬁeld that adiabatically couples trapped and untrapped
internal atomic states for atoms with kinetic energies above a value set by the ﬁeld frequency. The
rf-ﬁeld can also induce nonadiabatic changes of internal atomic spin states (F, M ) that lead to
heating and enhanced loss of atoms. In this paper we use wave packet simulations to show that the
evaporation process can induce these nonadiabatic transitions which change the internal spin state
of doubly spin-polarized (2,2) trapped atoms. We also verify the validity of a multistate Landau-
Zener model in describing the nonadiabatic dynamics. In addition, we calculate exchange relaxation
rate coeﬃcients for collisions between atoms in the (2, M ) states of 23Na atoms. Large exchange
relaxation coeﬃcients for 23Na as compared to 87Rb F = 2 suggest that evaporative cooling of (2,2)
Na will be more diﬃcult than for the corresponding state of Rb.

I. INTRODUCTION

Bose-Einstein condensation has been observed recently in alkali gases [1–4]. This has led to a series of fascinating
experiments involving collective excitations [5–9] and atom lasers [10,11]. These experiments take place at very low
temperatures, ranging from microkelvins to nanokelvins. Such temperatures can be reached only with evaporative
cooling if suﬃcient atomic densities for condensation are to be obtained. The idea for evaporative cooling was originally
developed in connection with attempts to observe Bose-Einstein condensation in spin-polarized hydrogen [12,13] (for
a review see Ref. [14]). Although the process has been studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally, some
aspects still require clariﬁcation.

The basic idea for evaporative cooling is simple. The atoms in a hyperﬁne state (F, M ) are trapped by spatially
inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds. The edges of the trap are then lowered, allowing the hot atoms to escape. Atoms left
in the trap collide elastically and eventually a thermal equilibrium is reached, but at some temperature which is lower
than the original one. In practice the trap edges are ”lowered” by coupling diﬀerent magnetic substates (spin states)
of the atoms with a radiofrequency (rf) ﬁeld of variable frequency [14,15], as shown in Fig. 1. Within the rotating wave
approximation we can shift the energy states by multiples of the radiofrequency ﬁeld photon energy, and eventually
we obtain the curve crossing situation for F = 2 featured in Fig. 2 [14]. We can view the evaporation as adiabatic
following of the lowest rf-dressed state by the moving atoms. Here we will consider the doubly spin-polarized level
(2, 2), for which Bose-Einstein condensation has been achieved for 87Rb but not for 23Na.

The evaporation process requires elastic binary collisions for the rethermalisation of the atoms that remain trapped.
However, inelastic collisions can give the collision products large kinetic energies which lead to loss or heating of
trapped atoms. The normal mechanism for collisional relaxation of the trapped (2,2) doubly spin-polarized state
of 87Rb or 23Na, spin-dipolar relaxation, has a very small collisional rate coeﬃcient [16–18] which would limit the
lifetime of a Bose-Einstein condensate to a very acceptable 30 seconds. However, if the evaporation process results
in the formation of (2, 1) and (2, 0) spin components via rf-induced nonadiabatic transitions due to atomic motion in
the spatially inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, inelastic collisions between these components and/or the remaining (2,2)
spin state can occur by a strong spin-exchange mechanism and in principle lead to large collisional relaxation rates.
The actual size of the relaxation rate is strongly species dependent. In Refs. [19,20] it has been shown that spin
1) for 87Rb is strongly reduced compared with the equivalent
relaxation for the collision between (2,2) and (1,
collision in 23Na. The rate coeﬃcients are anomalously small for 87Rb, because of the fortuitous near equality of the
scattering lengths for the 3Σ+
g states that correlate with the separated ground state atoms. We will also

ﬁnd in this paper that the various spin-exchange collisional rate coeﬃcients between 23Na (2, M ) spin components
are about three orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding values for 87Rb.

In this paper we consider two distinct aspects of the relevant physics: (1) the rf-induced nonadiabatic dynamics
due to motion in the spatially inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld that move atoms from the primary trapped state (2,2)
to the other states of the same hyperﬁne manifold, and (2) the rate coeﬃcients for collisions involving other (2, M )
states. For the ﬁrst aspect, we consider the coupled ﬁve-state multicrossing situation that occurs in the rf-dressed
picture for 23Na (2, M ) shown in Fig. 2. Especially in the early stages of cooling, when the frequency of the rf-ﬁeld
is large and the crossing between the (2, M ) states occurs at very large energies, it is possible that the atoms will
not adiabatically follow the rf-dressed potential a shown in Fig. 2. Atoms can, after traversing the crossing, either
remain on the bare (2,2) state [21] or move, for example, to the bare (2,1) state. In other words, we have nonadiabatic
dynamical transfer between the rf-dressed states. These two bare states are trapping states, so atoms will return to
the crossing region instead of escaping from the trap. When they traverse the crossing again, population can move
to the spin states (2,1) and (2,0), and then approach the trap center, thus leading to the loss-inducing collisions to
be considered as the second aspect of the physics.

The adiabatic following, leading to evaporation, and the unwanted nonadiabatic transitions can be studied by
describing atoms with multicomponent wave packets that evolve under a time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation. This
model does not contain all aspects of atomic dynamics during evaporation such as the rethermalization, but does
demonstrate adequately the possibility of nonadiabatic transitions and the prospects for harmful inelastic atomic
collisions in the trap. It has been proposed that a Landau-Zener model can be used for a semiclassical study of the
evaporation as well [14] and we will show that a multistate version of the Landau-Zener model [22–24] describes our
wave packet dynamics rather well. This allows one to extrapolate some of our results into a much larger parameter
space than we have covered with our wave packet analysis.

The lowest rf-dressed state has nonnegligible contributions from all (2, M ) bare states of the F = 2 manifold. This
is called rf-mixing of the spin states. One might think that the collisions between these mixed states can eﬀectively
lead to collisions between the diﬀerent M -states, especially when the energy diﬀerence between the states becomes
nonnegligible compared to the strength of the rf-coupling. However, we ﬁnd that this mixing will not lead to enhanced
inelastic collision rates at all. This conclusion agrees with that obtained by Moerdijk et al. [25]. The physical reason
for this behavior is that the rf-ﬁeld only rotates the quantization axis, and the T -matrix elements for the inelastic
processes change accordingly, not picking up any exchange collision amplitude. Thus the rf-dressed state which has
the lowest energy simply obtains the label (2,2) along the new quantization axis. In short, when two atoms in the
lowest rf-dressed state collide, the process is equal to a collision between two atoms in the bare (2,2) state.

In this paper we ﬁrst present the collisional rate coeﬃcients for 23Na F = 2 trapping in Sec. II and discuss the rf-
mixing of states. Then we demonstrate the nonadiabatic dynamical transfer processes in Sec. III using wave packets.
Furthermore, we discuss the multistate Landau-Zener modelling of the dynamics of the evaporation process. Finally,
the discussion in Sec. IV concludes the paper.

1, 0, 1, 2. For magnetic ﬁelds below

The 23Na and 87Rb ground state atoms have two hyperﬁne components, F = 1 and F = 2 as shown for 23Na in
1 and the F = 2 level is 5-fold degenerate,
Fig. 1. The F = 1 level is 3-fold degenerate, with components M = 1, 0,
with components M =
1 mT the internal energy of the magnetic sublevels
depends linearly on the trapping ﬁeld where the magnetic sublevels are deﬁned with respect to the direction of
this ﬁeld. The F label is strictly speaking only valid for zero magnetic ﬁeld. However, we wish to determine the
inelastic collision rate coeﬃcients in a weak (mT) magnetic ﬁeld and it turns out that the dominant loss processes
are nearly independent of ﬁeld strength B and are well approximated by the corresponding zero-ﬁeld rate. We will
present B = 0 rates and scattering T -matrix elements labeled according to the zero-ﬁeld labels (F, M ) only, but have
conﬁrmed numerically that small magnetic ﬁelds do not change the rate by more than 20 %.

The (2,2) trapping state is known to relax with a small rate coeﬃcient, on the order of 10−15 cm3/s, due to the weak
spin-dipole mechanism [17,18,26]. Relaxation leads to formation of a lower (1, M ) state accompanied by the release of
a large amount of energy. However, if other (2, M ) components of F = 2 are present due to rf-induced nonadiabatic
motion in the trapping potential, these components may decay via the exchange mechanism. We will show that this
mechanism leads to very large rate coeﬃcients for 23Na, greater than 10−11 cm3/s, that is, orders of magnitude larger
than for dipolar relaxation. On the other hand, (2, M ) components of 87Rb have very small exchange relaxation rate
coeﬃcients, on the order of 10−14 cm3/s, just as is known to be the case for exchange collisions between a (2, 2) and

2

−

1) atom [19,20]. The small rate coeﬃcients for 87Rb ensure that this process is not signiﬁcant for the F = 2 level
(1,
of 87Rb, which can be evaporatively cooled and Bose-condensed in the (2, 2) state [27]. So far no one has achieved
Bose-Einstein condensation for the (2, 2) level of 23Na.

We now extend the calculations of Ref. [20] to apply to collisions of two (2, M ) atoms as well. We assume that the
collision starts with the two atoms in the hyperﬁne levels (F1, M1), (F2, M2) and with relative angular momentum
state ℓ, m and ends with the atoms in the levels (F3, M3), (F4, M4) and relative angular momentum state ℓ′, m′. At
suﬃciently low temperature only s-waves contribute, for which ℓ = 0, m = 0. We introduce symmetrized states of
atom pairs that are symmetric with respect to exchange of identical atoms, with half-integer nuclear spin quantum
number, and deﬁne a symmetrized T -matrix as done by Stoof et al. [26] for transitions between the symmetrized
states

Spin-exchange collisions are only possible if the following selection rules are obeyed: ℓ = ℓ′, m = m′, f = f ′, and
M1 + M2 = M3 + M4. Equation (2) simpliﬁes considerably for s-wave collisions, since ℓ = 0 and f ′ = f = Ft; in
particular, for s-wave (2, M1) + (2, M2) collisions inelastic exchange transitions are only possible if f = Ft = 0 or 2.
The spin-exchange selection rules show that a doubly-polarized gas cannot decay via this mechanism. However,
if the evaporation process produces the other trappable F = 2 states this is no longer valid. Table I therefore gives
explicit formulas that can be used for evaluating the T -matrix amplitudes for (2, 2) + (2, 0) and (2, 1) + (2, 1) s-wave
exchange collisions. The shorthand notation used in Table I is

where the notation means T (Ft)

One might expect that (2, 2) + (2, 1) inelastic exchange collisions will be important. However, since then M3 + M4 =
M1 + M2 = 3, it follows that spin-exchange matrix elements with f = f ′ = 3 or 4 contribute. For s-wave scattering
there is only one spin state with either value of f . Hence only elastic s-wave T -matrix elements exist while inelastic
s-wave spin-exchange transitions are absent. The only remaining (2, 2) + (2, 1) relaxation mechanism is via the weak
dipolar interaction. On the other hand a p-wave exchange relaxation is permitted for (2, 2)+(2, 1) collisions, where the
inelastic T (Ft)(213p
223p) matrix elements contribute as the temperature increases. These T -matrix elements vary
as k3/2, where ¯hk is the relative momentum, whereas the s-wave amplitudes vary as k1/2. In numerical calculations, we
ﬁnd p-wave inelastic exchange collisions will have rate coeﬃcients two orders of magnitude or more smaller than s-wave
exchange collisions for temperatures below 10 µK for 23Na collisions. The p-wave contributions rapidly increase with
collision energy, and become comparable to the s-wave contributions above 100 µK. Thus, some collisional relaxation

due to (2, 2) + (2, 1) collisions may be important at the start of evaporation, but such collisions become less signiﬁcant
as the condensation limit is approached.

In order to calculate the actual zero-ﬁeld exchange collision rates for collisions of 23Na (2, M ) levels, we use the same
quantum scattering method and model of the 23Na potentials as in Ref. [31]. We adjusted the potentials slightly to
locate correctly the positions of the triplet Feshbach resonance levels reported recently [32]; the calculated scattering

For Bose-Einstein condensation studies the typical atomic densities are on the order of 1014 atoms/cm3. Therefore
the three orders of magnitude diﬀerence between 23Na and 87Rb rate coeﬃcients implies that even relatively small
population transfer from the (2,2) trapped level to the (2, 1) and (2, 0) states during the evaporation process can cause
a strong/unwanted increase in trap loss for 23Na, but has an insigniﬁcant eﬀect for 87Rb.

B. Eﬀect of the rf-ﬁeld on exchange relaxation

The rate coeﬃcients in Sec. II A are evaluated using so-called bare atomic states where the rf-ﬁeld has not been
included. We now turn our attention to the eﬀect of rf-induced dressing on the inelastic collision rate coeﬃcients. The
dressing mixes diﬀerent (2, M ) levels and there is a question as to whether this mixing aﬀects the exchange relaxation
rates of the dominant (2,2) trapped level. Moerdijk et al. [25] have argued that ﬁeld-dressing has a negligible eﬀect
on collisional relaxation. We now discuss the rf-mixing and its consequences.

In a magnetic trap the atoms are held in a position dependent trapping ﬁeld ~Btrap.
~Btrap(~0)

In fact, for a spherically
x2, where ~x = ~0 is the center of the trap. This magnetic ﬁeld
harmonic trapping potential
deﬁnes a space-ﬁxed z-axis at each point in the trap along which the atomic (F, M ) states are deﬁned. The variations
of the magnetic ﬁeld strength over the atom cloud are small compared to the ﬁeld strength in the middle of the trap.
Hence if only this trapping ﬁeld is present the zero-ﬁeld T -matrix elements and the corresponding rate coeﬃcients are
valid everywhere in the trap.

~Btrap(~x)
|

| ∝

−

The components of an rf-ﬁeld, with frequency ν, parallel and perpendicular to the trapping ﬁeld have diﬀerent
= 1 transitions. In fact, for the evaporation process the
∆M
eﬀects on the mixing of states [34]. The latter leads to
|
rf-photon energy hν is chosen to be nearly resonant with the (2, 2) to (2, 1) transition and since the trapping ﬁeld
is suﬃciently weak that the internal energy of the atomic states depends linearly on the ﬁeld strength the photon is
resonant with all adjacent M states as well. The parallel component of the rf-ﬁeld leads to
= 0 transitions.
However, the rf-photon is not resonant with the allowed parallel transitions (1, M )
(2, M ). Therefore, at each point
in the trap only the component of the rf-ﬁeld that is locally perpendicular to the trapping ﬁeld leads to mixing of
atomic sublevels. The amplitude of the rf-ﬁeld is small compared to the trapping ﬁeld.

∆M

In order to keep the modelling tractable we make several although not crucial simpliﬁcations. Variations in the
direction of the trapping ﬁeld over the atom cloud can be neglected. This allows us to use a single z-axis that describes
the quantization axis everywhere in the trap. Moreover, the atom-ﬁeld interaction will be treated using the rotating
wave approximation. Then it is convenient to use a coordinate system that rotates with frequency ν around the z-axis.
The rf-ﬁeld is stationary in this coordinate system and is chosen to lie along the rotating x′-axis with a ﬁeld strength
Brf . Following Ref. [34] the F = 2 atomic hyperﬁne Hamiltonian coupling to the rf-ﬁeld can then be interpreted in
terms of a magnetic moment ~F rotating around an eﬀective ﬁeld and we arrive at a local Hamiltonian which describes
the motion of the magnetic moment at each position ~x in the magnetic trap

where ¯hσ is the local energy spacing of the atomic magnetic sublevels, shown as the dotted lines of Fig. 2, and Ω is
the zero-detuning Rabi frequency of the atom-ﬁeld coupling. Here ˆFz and ˆFx′ are the components of spin-F operators
along the z- and x′-axis respectively. Note that for example in the space-ﬁxed x direction it follows

H(~x) = ¯hσ(~x) ˆFz + ¯hΩ ˆFx′,

with x = 0 as the trap center, m is the atomic mass and ω is the trap frequency in the x direction. Here Ed is the
bare state trap depth (see Fig. 2), deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the bare level spacing of adjacent M states in the
center of the trap and the rf frequency hν.

We have assumed for simplicity that the trapping in three dimensions is achieved by a static ﬁeld [2], and not a
TOP trap [1]. In a TOP trap there is an additional fast-oscillating ﬁeld which has an amplitude comparable to the
trapping ﬁeld. The amplitude of the rf-ﬁeld used for evaporation is small compared to the trapping ﬁeld (even at the
center of the trap where the trapping ﬁeld is weakest), which allows the description we presented above. If we simply
assume that the fast-oscillating TOP ﬁeld can be adiabatically eliminated, i.e., we obtain the time-averaged trapping
potential, our studies apply also to the TOP trap. The validity of this adiabatic elimination of the TOP ﬁeld in the
presence of the evaporation rf-ﬁeld is to some extent an open question [35]. It does not fall within the scope of this
paper, however, so we do not discuss it further.

A collision between two atoms occurs locally in sub-nanosecond time scales. It is suﬃciently fast that the rf-ﬁeld
as seen by the atoms during a collision is frozen [25] (the period of the rf-ﬁeld is on the order of about 100 ns). Thus
the rotating x′-axis can be considered ﬁxed during the collision. Therefore, Eqs. (2)-(9) are again valid but now with
deﬁned relative to a rotating z′-axis. To see this just note that the simple spin structure of Eq. (10)
spin states
allows us to introduce a transformation R that rotates the z-axis into a z′-axis with the property that the transformed
Hamiltonian is of the form ∆(~x)Fz′ . In fact, it can be shown that this is achieved with a rotation by an angle θ
around the axis perpendicular to both z- and x′-axis, where

MM ′ are rotation matrices [36] and the subscripts z and z′ denote the axis along which the state

are in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian (10), the decay processes due to collisions are simply given with the bare rate
iz′, only the weak spin
constants. For example, if the atoms are everywhere in the local doubly-polarized state
dipole interaction causes decay of the sample. We have explicitly veriﬁed e.g.
for the dressed (2,2) state that the
exchange transition contributions from the bare states such as (2,1) and (2,0) cancel out completely.

The premise that the atoms are always in the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (10) hinges on the assumption that
the motion of the atoms has a negligible eﬀect. In fact the premise is not always satisﬁed and Sec. III is devoted to
the nonadiabatic eﬀects induced by the motion of a single atom through a spatially varying magnetic ﬁeld and hence
a varying σ. In such a ﬁeld at each point in the trap the coordinate system with the quantization axis z′ is diﬀerent.
This is most inconvenient if we want to follow the motion of a single atom. Therefore, we use the basis of eigenstates
iz of the Hamiltonian (10) when Ω = 0 everywhere in the trap; these are the base states [21]. Of course, for

non-zero Ω the Hamiltonian is not diagonal in this basis. There is coupling of adjacent magnetic levels with

III. DYNAMICS OF EVAPORATION AND NONADIABATIC TRANSITIONS

The calculation of the transition amplitudes in Sec. II shows that for 23Na the collisions between the atoms in
an rf-ﬁeld does not necessarily lead to enhanced inelastic rate coeﬃcients. However, if we consider moving atoms
in the absence of collisions, then for an atom initially in the (dressed) doubly polarized spin state it is possible to
have nonadiabatic transitions to those rf-dressed states that have strong inelastic processes when they collide with
other atoms. As an atom moves fast enough in the spatially inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, its spin ~F can not follow
adiabatically the changing magnetic ﬁeld. The breakdown of the adiabatic following is especially likely when the
rf-ﬁeld brings the bare states into resonance. Any atom that has enough energy to leave the trap during evaporative
cooling will necessarily traverse such a resonance point.

We model the evaporation process by describing the atom as a wave packet. This description takes into account
any nonadiabatic process due to the atomic motion as the wave packet moves back and forth in the trap. In other
words, we use the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation

i¯h

∂Ψ(~x, t)
∂t

=

(~x)Ψ(~x, t),

H

(15)

where the state vector Ψ(~x, t) has 2F + 1 components (ﬁve in our case), and
is the Hamiltonian consisting of the
kinetic energy term, the bare-atom Hamiltonian and the rf-induced couplings. Equation (15) is then solved for some
suitable initial condition Ψ(~x, 0).

H

The true dynamics of evaporative cooling is quite complex, and we can not realistically expect that Eq. (15) describes
the situation completely, or that it can be easily solved when all the characteristics of the situation are entered in
to the atomic Hamiltonian
. We can, however, make simpliﬁcations, some of which have been discussed in the
previous section, that nevertheless allow us to convincingly demonstrate some aspects of the rf-induced evaporative
cooling, including the nonadiabatic transitions. We restrict our studies to such times that the atoms can re-enter
the trap only once. This ignores the possibility of multiple passes, i.e., the possibility that those hot atoms which
due to nonadiabatic transitions return to the trap center can reach the rf-resonance again at a later time. For 23Na
this approximation is allowed as the rate coeﬃcients for the inelastic processes suggest that only few such atoms can
survive until they reach the resonance region again.

H

Another simpliﬁcation is that we consider only one spatial dimension, which reduces the situation to the one shown
In most cases during the evaporation process the atomic
in Fig. 2. However, this is not a crucial simpliﬁcation.
wave packets behave very classically.
In this picture only the motion of the atomic wave packet in the direction
perpendicular to the rf-induced edge of the trap is needed in studying the nonadiabatic transitions. In other words,

6

we need to model only that perpendicular motion. Although we allow our wave packets to start from the center of
the trap, at the edge of the trap their behavior corresponds also to those atoms that have a more complicated 3D
motion but the same behavior in the perpendicular direction near the trap edge. This also means that our approach
is valid for all kinds of trap conﬁgurations.

For F = 2 we get in the bare state basis [from Eqs. (11) and (14)]

We take the mean momentum of the wave packet at the center of the trap as a measure of the kinetic energy of the
wave packet. In our study we have selected the radiofrequency such that the crossing of the potentials occurs at the
energy corresponding to the kinetic energy of 5 µK in temperature units; see Fig. 2. This sets our bare state trap
depth Ed/kB = 5 µK. This is a rather low value, but it is diﬃcult to increase it much more, because the requirements
for spatial and temporal step sizes in the numerical treatment of Eq. (15) increase rapidly with Ed. However, we shall
later discuss how our results can be scaled into other values of Ed using the multistate Landau-Zener model.

Our trap frequency is 112 Hz, which sets the location of the crossing point at 86 µm from the trap center. The
initial wave packet is a Gaussian, which is reasonably narrow in both position and momentum, and moves towards
the crossing point. Since the initial kinetic energy in our simulations is of the order of 5 µK, it is possible to obtain
narrow distributions in both representations. We distribute the Gaussian wave packet over the bare states so that in
fact only the lowest rf-dressed state a is occupied. Similarly, we express the ﬁnal state populations in terms of the
rf-dressed states. However, the ﬁve-state problem is easy to deﬁne in terms of the bare states, and thus we use this
basis for the numerical work. We have propagated the wave packets by splitting the Hamiltonian (16) into a kinetic
energy part and a potential energy and coupling part (the split operator method). The kinetic energy part is then
treated using the Crank-Nicholson method, and the rest of
by the diagonalization method. For more details see
Ref. [39].

In Fig. 3 we demonstrate how the evaporation works as a function of the kinetic energy Ekin of the initial wave
packet for diﬀerent rf-coupling strengths Ω (as deﬁned in Eq. (14)). The curves indicate the probability of the atoms
leaving the trap after the ﬁrst passage of the crossing point by reaching positions
In addition to
showing the total evaporation Pevap, we also give the contributions (Pa, Pb and Pc) of the individual nontrapped (for
86 µm) rf-dressed states a, b and c. Note that Pevap = Pa + Pb + Pc. For small Ω the evaporation probabilities
x
|
are clearly peaked at the resonance temperature Ed = 5 µK. Also the ﬂat state c dominates the evaporation process,
demonstrating nonadiabaticity due to the insuﬃcient coupling strength. However, as Ω is increased, the leading
contribution comes from the a state. But although for e.g. Ω = (2π) 3.0 kHz the total evaporation is nearly complete
for a large range of temperatures, the contribution from Pb and Pc is still nonnegligible.

Typically one models the level crossings using the Landau-Zener theory, which applies to two-state systems. How-
ever, here we have a multistate bowtie crossing model, in which the states are coupled sequentially as in Eq. (14).
Fortunately, it has been shown that for the particular case of Eqs. (11) and (14) the bowtie model can be solved ana-
lytically [22–24]. In fact, this solution can be expressed in terms of the solutions to the related two-state Landau-Zener
(LZ) model, where

According to the ﬁve-state case of the model (see e.g. Ref. [24]) the populations for the untrapped states after one
traversal of the crossing are

model is only applicable when the total energy is higher than the bare-state energy at the resonance point. For more
details about applying LZ theory to wave packet dynamics see Refs. [37–39].

Ed and Ekin is the kinetic energy of an atom at the trap center. In Fig. 3 we show the LZ predictions
where E = Ekin −
as dotted lines together with the actual wave packet results. The agreement is good for Ekin > 5µK, i.e., when vC
is deﬁned. For smaller kinetic energies the Landau-Zener model cannot be applied, because the model assumes a
classical trajectory through the resonance, and for Ekin < Ed this trajectory does not exist.

In Fig. 4 we show the evaporation probability as a function of the initial kinetic energy, expressed in temperature
units, for values of Ω large enough that the evaporation is very adiabatic since nearly all atoms leave the trapping
region in the rf-dressed state a. The graphs all exhibit a rapid change from trapping into total evaporation around
some critical kinetic energy. Since the increase in Ω leads to the lowering of the adiabatic barrier (see Fig. 2) and
the atoms follow the rf-dressed states adiabatically, the critical temperature decreases with increasing Ω. However, if
we consider the atomic motion in the lowest rf-dressed trapping state classically, we ﬁnd that the minimum kinetic
energy required for total evaporation is larger than the energy required to reach the top of the adiabatic barrier. The
top of these barriers is indicated by the plus-signs in Fig. 4. Note that eventually, as Ekin increases, the evaporation
probability, although not shown here, will again drop.

For many values of the Rabi frequency and kinetic energy the evaporation is not 100 % eﬃcient. Atoms can reﬂected
back into the trap by nonadiabatic transitions in which the atomic wave packet initially on state a encounters the
crossing region and is reﬂected back towards trap center in states a, b or c. The term nonadiabatic is now used in
a slightly diﬀerent fashion to imply that not only the spin state changes, as in the discussion of Fig. 3, but also the
direction of the atom has changed. Fig. 5 illustrates for two diﬀerent values of Ω the probability for returning to
the trap center in states a, b, and c. Clearly, if the ﬁeld is not strong enough, a notable portion of the returning
atoms can enter the unwanted b and c states, which correspond to the (2, 1) and (2, 0) states at the trap center.
These nonadiabatic transitions where the atoms return to the trap center are not a direct problem if the collisional
loss rates are small enough, since the trapped atoms can be allowed to ”slosh” in the trap several times before they
exit properly, as discussed by Ketterle and van Druten [14]. However, for 23Na F = 2 atoms, these nonadiabatic
transitions can cause complications, due to the large inelastic collision rates presented in Sec. II.

Simple estimates can be made for the eﬀect of inelastic collisions due to the hot returning a = (2, 1) and b = (2, 0)
atoms inside the trap. The characteristic time for collisions for rate constant K and density n is τ = 1/(Kn) and
the characteristic mean free path is xmfp = 1/(σn) = v/(Kn), where σ is the collision cross section and v the relative
velocity. With typical condensate densities on the order of 1014 atoms/cm3, τ is on the order of a typical trap
vibrational period and xmfp on the order of the trap size for the case of 23Na, whereas τ is much longer than a
vibrational period for the case of 87Rb. Therefore, a returning (2, 0) 23Na atom is likely to undergo a “bad” inelastic
collision that ejects two atoms from the trap, whereas a (2, 0) 87Rb atom would pass through the trap unhindered.
There could even be problems with collisions in a cold thermal gas above the critical temperature for Bose-Einstein
condensation. If nonadiabatic reﬂection produced (2, 1) atoms, they would be trapped, and their density could build
up. Near the start of evaporation, where the atoms are still relatively hot, p-wave collisions with (2, 0) atoms could
result in atom loss, whereas near the end of evaporation where the collision energy is low enough that only s-wave
collisions are signiﬁcant, a build up of (2, 1) population would result in losses due to collisions between (2, 1) atoms
with a time constant determined by the (2, 1) density. This could easily be less than 1 s for 23Na even if only a small
fraction of the (2, 2) population were converted to (2, 1). These considerations suggest that evaporative cooling of
23Na in the (2, 2) state may be much more diﬃcult than for 87Rb, for which evaporative cooling is known to work [1].
The rf power in the 23Na case would have to be suﬃciently high to avoid nonadiabatic trap dynamics.

The multistate Landau-Zener model cannot describe the sequence of classical trajectories that leads to nonadiabatic
reﬂection back into the center of the trap. This setback is not very important, because it is clear that if the evaporation
process is eﬀective for a single pass, then necessarily we can ignore any nonadiabatic eﬀects. Since our wave packet
results show that the multistate Landau-Zener theory is a good model for evaporation without reﬂection, we can
always determine for any temperature and trap frequency the minimum rf-ﬁeld strength that is required to quench
the nonadiabatic processes by making the single-pass evaporation nearly 100 % eﬀective. This is achieved by requiring
that Λ

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that in the 23Na F = 2 system inelastic low-temperature collision rate coeﬃcients can be larger
than 10−11 cm3/s. These rate coeﬃcients occur when the collision partners are (2,1) and (2,1), or (2,2) and (2,0).
For 87Rb we ﬁnd that all rate coeﬃcients are small, on the order of 10−14 cm3/s. Another interesting outcome of our
studies is the fact that rf-induced mixing plays no role in the occurrence of the inelastic processes. The rf-dressed
states are obtained from the bare states by a rotation. However, this basis change does not alter the physics of the
situation, it merely redeﬁnes the quantization axis for the atomic angular momentum.

In the absence of any mixing eﬀects the inelastic processes in the 23Na F = 2 system can occur only if we have
true occupation of the rf-dressed states labelled as (2, 1) or (2, 0). Such occupation can be created by nonadiabatic
population transfer from the (2, 2) rf-dressed state to the other rf-dressed states. As the atoms move in spatially
inhomogeneous ﬁelds, the local orientation of the quantization axis (B-ﬁeld) may change faster than the ability of the
system to follow it adiabatically. With wave packet simulations we have demonstrated that the rf-ﬁeld can induce
such nonadiabatic transfer during evaporative cooling. Furthermore, it is clear that due to this transfer atoms can
return to the trap center while occupying the rf-dressed states (2, 1) and (2, 0).

The above eﬀect can be reduced by keeping the strength of the rf-ﬁeld so large that the adiabatic following is
ensured. However, at the early stages of evaporative cooling the spatial change of potentials near the ﬁeld-induced
resonance can be rapid. This can make it rather diﬃcult to achieve the total adiabatic following. In addition the p-wave
contributions to the inelastic processes are nonnegligible when T >
100 µK (for 23Na). Under these circumstances
∼
one can not allow the hot atoms to slosh in the trap too much before they leave it. So far condensation has not been
demonstrated for the 23Na F = 2 system. We believe that, in order to achieve it, one has to use clearly stronger
rf-ﬁelds than e.g. for the 23Na F = 1 system.

Our simulations have also demonstrated that the multistate Landau-Zener model [22–24] can predict the basic
wave packet dynamics of the evaporation process correctly. This multistate model can be given a simple analytic
solution only when we have equal energy diﬀerences between subsequent states and the sequential couplings given in
Eq. (14). If the rf-dressing of the states could not be described by the simple rotation of the quantization axis, then
the solution of the model would have to include the complicated construction of the continuously changing dressed
states from the bare states, in addition to the actual nonadiabatic processes. This is clearly connected to the fact that
a simple solution for the multistate LZ model in terms of the two-state case exists only for this particular case. Despite
its limitations, however, the multistate LZ model gives us a simple and reliable criterion for making evaporation so
eﬃcient that nonadiabatic transitions are strongly quenched.
Recently it was shown experimentally that a 87Rb (1,

1) condensate can be converted into a (2, 1) condensate
−
with a microwave pulse [40]. Our results for 23Na (2, 1)+(2, 1) collisions suggest that a similar experiment with the
23Na system would not work. However, such an experiment might be used to verify the loss rates presented in this
paper, as the pulsed creation of a (2, 1) condensate allows one to set a distinctive time point for the beginning of its
destruction.

In addition to the process illustrated in Sec. III nonadiabatic transfer can also arise if the frequency of the rf-
ﬁeld is not changed slowly compared to the other time scales of the system. The moving atoms would then see a
chirped ﬁeld, and the speed vC in the Landau-Zener model would correspond more to the change of location of the
rf-resonance point, than to the actual atomic wave packet motion through the resonance. This chirped rf-ﬁeld case
could be studied with wave packet dynamics [41].
It is also used in the output coupler schemes for the trapped
condensates [10]. However, we have assumed that the rf-ﬁeld frequency ν is changed so slowly that this eﬀect does
not arise.

A similar situation, i.e., motion of the crossing point past the atoms, can occur in the TOP trap, as discussed in
Sec. II [35]. It is generally assumed that the TOP ﬁeld changes so fast that the passing of the resonance is completely
diabatic—this also means that the rf-ﬁeld can be ignored when the time-averaged ﬁeld is determined for the TOP trap.
If the passing of the resonance were strongly adiabatic, the time-average would have to be performed after adding the
rf-induced resonances and couplings. Then very interesting eﬀects might arise (for an example see Ref. [42]).

FIG. 3. The evaporation probability Pevap as a function of the initial kinetic energy of the Gaussian wave packet for a
selection of Rabi frequencies after a single passage through the rf-induced resonance. We show the wave packet results for
total evaporation (solid line), and the individual rf-dressed state contributions Pa, Pb and Pc when they are nonnegligible.
The dotted lines give the predictions by the multistate Landau-Zener model for the probability of escaping the trap for the
rf-dressed states a, b and c. The dashed lines, labeled P LZ
evap, represent the total evaporation probability given by the multistate
Landau-Zener model.

Comment on “Degenerate Wannier The-

ory for Multiple Ionization”

Recent Letter of Pattard and Rost [1] suggests new
threshold laws for the processes of break up of a par-
ticle into several charged fragments, which, regretfully,
is incorrect. Previous studies, starting from the classical
paper by Wannier [2] derived fragmentation cross section
σ in a power-law form

σ(ǫ → 0) ∼ ǫµ ,

(1)

where ǫ is the energy excess above the break up thresh-
old. The primary task of the theory is to evaluate the
threshold index µ for diﬀerent multiparticle systems, a
comprehensive bibliography could be found in Ref. [3].
Pattard and Rost [1,4] suggest the threshold law of novel
functional form, namely, with an extra logarithmic ǫ-
dependence:

σ(ǫ → 0) ∼ ǫµ | ln ǫ|−ν .

(2)

According to the originally idea of Wannier [2], for the
Coulomb interaction between the fragments the thresh-
old law is deﬁned by the motion along the potential ridge
as the constituent particles ﬂy apart. This motion is un-
stable; survival on the ridge corresponds to the system
fragmentation, whereas sliding from it means that the
break up is not achieved. The instability of the motion
is characterized by a set of Lyapunov exponents λi. The
threshold index µ is expressed via sum of all Lyapunov
exponents [3,4]. In the present Comment we discuss the
key result obtained by Pattard and Rost in [1], and re-
peated in [4], namely, the novel threshold law (2).

The standard approach to derivation of threshold laws
relies on the analysis of classical trajectories in the vicin-
ity of the potential ridge where the equations of motion
are linearized over coordinates transversal to the ridge.
The system is described by a set of coupled linear equa-
tion that are diﬀerential over the time variable t. The
time-dependence of the coeﬃcients is eliminated by intro-
ducing the eﬀective time τ . The solutions of these equa-
tions q(τ ) depend on the eﬀective time as exp(λiτ ) where
the set of λi eigenvalues is found by solving the charac-
teristic equation. The threshold index µ is expressed via
λi, see for details Ref. [2,3] and bibliography therein.

Pattard and Rost [1,4] essentially retain the traditional
framework, but argue that the situation is changed when
the Lyapunov exponents happen to be degenerate. They
refer to the standard mathematical textbook [5] saying
that “If n eigenvalues are degenerate, the general solution
contains additional terms τ k exp(λτ ), (k < n)”. Further
they relate the logarithm in the alleged coordinate time-
dependence,

q(τ ) = τ k exp(λτ ) ≡ exp(λτ + k ln τ )

(k < n) ,

(3)

This reasoning is invalid. Consider harmonic vibra-
tions of a system with many degrees of freedom (for ex-
ample, a polyatomic molecule) around an equilibrium po-
sition. Some eigenfrequencies might be degenerate due to
symmetry reasons, or accidentally. The argumentation
by Pattard and Rost fully applies to this case; however,
as universally known, the logarithmic solutions (3) in fact
do not emerge [see Eq. (23.6) in Ref. [6] and subsequent
discussion]. The reason is clear:
in the harmonic ap-
proximation all the normal modes are fully decoupled and
hence a character of the time-dependence in each mode
does not depend on whether some other degenerate mode
exists or not.

This argument is directly related to the motion in the
vicinity of the potential ridge. The problem is described
by the Hamiltonian that is quadratic both in transversal
coordinates and momenta, similar to the harmonic ap-
proximation for a polyatomic molecule. The only diﬀer-
ence is that the equilibrium is unstable and some eigen-
frequencies are complex-valued [3]. Obviously this fact
does not inﬂuence the functional form of solutions of the
same equations of motion which still reveal no logarithmic
terms. The degenerate Lyapunov exponents are related
to the diﬀerent modes which are fully decoupled, there-
fore the logarithmic solutions (3), being mathematically
feasible for general linear diﬀerential equations, do not
emerge in the physical applications concerned.

As a summary, the threshold law is given by Eq. (1)

while the modiﬁcation (2) is never valid.

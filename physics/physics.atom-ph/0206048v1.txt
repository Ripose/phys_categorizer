Abstract

The spontaneous decay rates of an excited atom placed near a dielectric
cylinder are investigated. A special attention is paid to the case when the
cylinder radius is small in comparison with radiation wavelength (nanoﬁber
or photonic wire). In this case, the analytical expressions of the transition
rates for diﬀerent orientations of dipole are derived.
It is shown that the
main contribution to decay rates is due to quasistatic interaction of atom
dipole momentum with nanoﬁber and the contributions of guided modes are
exponentially small. On the contrary, in the case when the radius of ﬁber is
only slightly less than radiation wavelength, the inﬂuence of guided modes can
be substantial.The results obtained are compared with the case of dielectric
nanospheroid and ideally conducting wire.

I. INTRODUCTION

At ﬁrst sight, spontaneous emission is pure atomic process. However as it was ﬁrst
pointed out by Purcell [1], a resonant cavity can change the decay rate substantially. At
present it is known that not only resonant cavities but also any material body can inﬂuence
the decay rate of spontaneous emission [2]. Moreover, the control of decay rate of sponta-
neous emission already is widely used in practice when making the new eﬃcient sources of
the light [3].

In spite of qualitative understanding of inﬂuence of material bodies on the spontaneous
radiation of atom, only the inﬂuence of plane or spherical interface on decay rate is elaborated
in detail [4-10].

However the inﬂuence of dielectric ﬁber or metallic wire on decay rate of a single atom
is interesting from a theoretical as well as practical point of view. This is due to the fact

1

that the charged wires are successfully used to control atom motion [11,12]. The cylindrical
geometry is also important for investigation of ﬂuorescence of substances in submicron cap-
illaries [13,14]. Very important application of theory of decay rate in presence of dielectric
ﬁber is photonic wire lasers [15,16]. Finally, cylindrical geometry appears naturally when
considering carbon nanotubes [17,18]

The inﬂuence of ideally conducting cylindrical surface on decay rates is well investigated

both for atom inside a cylindrical cavity [19-21] and near cylinder [22].

The spontaneous emission of an atom in presence of a dielectric, semiconductor or metal-
lic cylinder is more complicated process. First investigation of the decay rate of an atom
placed on the axis of dielectric ﬁber was undertaken within classical approach in [23-24].
Recently this problem attracted new interest [25-28]. In [29-30] spontaneous emission near
carbon nanotubes was considered. The general line of novel papers was to use numerical
methods from the beginning. Unfortunately such an approach cannot answer many qual-
itative questions.
In this paper, we re-investigate the inﬂuence of a dielectric cylindrical
surface on rates of dipole transitions, using analytical approach. To obtain clear analytical
results we will investigate ﬁber with radius small in comparison with wavelength. We will
pay special attention to separate decay rates into radiating and guided (lasing) modes, and
nonradiative (lossy) decay rates.

The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we consider the decay rates
for an atom placed in close vicinity to nanoﬁber with any complex dielectric permittivity,
when one can use quasistatic approximations. We obtain simple analytical expression for
radiative and nonradiative decay rates for any orientation of dipole momentum of atom. In
Sect. 3 we consider the full electrodynamics problem of dipole decay rate near nanoﬁber
with any complex dielectric permittivity. We build the analytical expression for decay rate
through contour integral in complex plane of longitudinal wave number. Then we transform
general contour integrals to separate contributions of guided and radiating modes. In Sect.
4 general expressions obtained in Sect.3 are applied to z and ϕ, ρ orientations of dipole
momentum of an atom placed on the surface of lossless ﬁber.
In section 5 we present
graphical illustrations and discuss the results obtained. Geometry of the problem under
investigation is shown in Fig.1.

II. QUASISTATIC ANALYSIS OF DECAY RATE NEAR NANOFIBER

When the distance between the atom and ﬁber, and the radius of ﬁber are substantially

less than radiation wavelength, the ﬁber is polarized only near the atom.

As a result, the radiation of atom + ﬁber system will be of the dipole-type and the

relative radiative decay rate will take the following form:

dtot|
= |
d0|
|
Here γ0 is the free space decay rate, dtot is the total dipole momentum of the atom +
nanoﬁber system and d0 is the dipole momentum of atom in free space. The total dipole
momentum dtot can be found from the solution of quasistatic problem

In the case of atom placed on the surface of ﬁber these results agree with those obtained
in the case of inﬁnitely thin dielectric nanospheroid [33,34]. Besides, these results agree with
decay rates of an atom placed on the axis of dielectric ﬁber [23,24]. Indeed, for ρ′ = a we

The only diﬀerence is for ρ- oriented dipole, where we have enhancement by ε2. The
physical interpretation is as follows. From QED point of view, decay rate is due to inter-
action of the dipole with electromagnetic modes, modiﬁed by ﬁber. The tangential (ϕ, z)
components of mode electric ﬁeld are continuous. So the decay rates of dipoles with (ϕ, z)
orientations on the surface and in the body of ﬁber should be the same. On the contrary the
ρ - component of mode electric ﬁeld is discontinuous at the surface (The normal component
of D = εE is continuous). It explains the diﬀerence between decay rates of dipole with ρ
orientation.

We should also mention that our results do not agree with decay rates of an atom inside
photonic wire found in [15,16]. We believe that results [15,16] are misleading because of
very crude approximation of ﬁber by plane waveguide.

In the case of nanowires, that is in the case of ε < 0, the excitation of plasmon resonances
is possible and one should add additional terms to (16). The detailed investigation of
inﬂuence of plasmon resonances to decay rates will be presented elsewhere [35].

Analogous additional terms occur in the case of dielectric ﬁbers also and are due to
guided modes. In next sections we will show that these terms are exponentially small for
nanoﬁbers. As a result one can use quasistatic formulae for nanoﬁber safely.

The results obtained, (16), are valid only for dielectric and metallic nanocylinders. The

and main contribution to far ﬁeld is due to m=0 term. As a result the potential of reﬂected
ﬁeld for ρ-orientation of dipole decreases at inﬁnity more slowly than (13). It means that
dipole momentum, induced in ideally conducting nanowire, tends to inﬁnity when wire radius
goes to zero. Respectively, the decay rate tends to inﬁnity too. This fact is in agreement
with the exact solution of the electrodynamics problem [22], where it was shown that the
decay rate of radially oriented dipole tends to inﬁnity when cylinder radius tends to zero.

Up to now we considered only the radiative decay rates. However even for dielectric
nanobodies the nonradiative losses can be substantial. Here the nonradiative losses are due
losses inside nanobody, which are proportional to imaginary part of dielectric permittivity.
To take the nonradiative losses into account, one should calculate either the energy ﬂow into
nanobody or the full work made by reﬂected ﬁeld over dipole. In this case the total decay
rates can be described by well-known expression, [36],

(19)

(20)

which is valid within classical as well quantum theory for any complex value of dielectric
permittivity [37-39]. In (20) k = ω/c is wavevector.

In the case of bodies (nanobodies) whose size is small in comparison with the radiation
wavelength, it possible to build the perturbation theory in terms of the wave vector k [40],
or, more exactly, in terms of the ratio between the characteristic size a of the body and the
wavelength λ, i. e., ka

1.

In this case, it is possible to expand the expression for the reﬂected ﬁeld d0E(R)(r′, ω)

governing the change of the decay rate in a power series of k:

d0E(R)(r′, ω)
d2

= a1 + b1k + c1k2 + id1k3 + ...

(21)

where the coeﬃcients a1, b1, c1, and d1 are determined by solving some quasistatic problems
[40]. The coeﬃcient a1 is determined by solving the static problem on the dipole near the
nanobody. It is important to note that the ﬁrst three terms are due to near ﬁelds, while
radiation ﬁelds appear only starting with the fourth term, which is proportional to k3.

In our case, the quasistatic solution is given by

E(R) =

(22)

where ˜ϕ(2) (r, r′) is given by (9). Substituting this expression into (20) and keeping only the
leading term in k we obtain the expressions for the nonradiative decay rates near nanoﬁber:

It should be noted, these expressions are similar to plane dielectric interface, where the

Maxwell’s propagation theory, we will ﬁnd the exact expressions for decay rates, which
include the contributions from guided modes.

According to [37-39] classical and quantum-electrodynamics calculations give the same
In present section we
results for dipole transition rate normalized to its vacuum value.
shall investigate the inﬂuence of a dielectric cylinder on transition rates within classical
approach, where the full decay rate can be expressed through classical reﬂected ﬁeld at
the atom position (20). Thus the reﬂected ﬁeld must be found to determine the total decay
rate. To ﬁnd the reﬂected ﬁeld, it is necessary to solve the full system of Maxwell’s equations
where dipole momentum of oscillator is a source and use appropriate boundary conditions.
To ﬁnd the reﬂected ﬁeld we follow the approach of Katsenelenbaum [23,24] and Wait
[41]. According to that approach one should expand all ﬁelds over cylinder harmonics. For
longitudinal components we have the following expressions:

the decreasing of ﬁelds at space inﬁnity (ρ
) the integration in (25) should be over path

As it was mentioned above, the important feature of dielectric ﬁber is the presence of
guided modes, which diﬀers substantially from free space spherical waves. Such modes are
eﬀectively used in optical communications lines. Note there are no such modes in the case
of dielectric sphere or ideally conducting cylinder. So-called whispering gallery modes are
decaying ones even in the case of lossless materials.

Thus there are two types of modes in presence of dielectric ﬁber: free space radiation
modes and wave guiding modes. From mathematical point of view these modes correspond
to diﬀerent types of spectrum. The guided modes correspond to discrete spectrum while
radiating modes correspond to continuous part of spectrum. In this connection the expres-
sions (37)- (39) are not fully suitable for further analysis, because the guided modes are not
separated here.

The appearance of guided modes is connected with poles in subintegral expressions
(37),(38) and (39). One can show that in the case of lossless dielectric these poles are
situated on the real axis of h between k and k√ε and the number of poles is ﬁnite [23,24].
Now transforming integration contour from C1 to C2 as it is shown in Fig.2 and applying

the residue theorem, it is possible to separate radiating and guided modes

where the sum is over all poles hα,m of subintegral functions and Res means residue.

In expressions (40)-(42) the ﬁrst term corresponds to spherical waves running to inﬁnity,
while the second term corresponds to guided modes. It shpould be emphasized that in the

10

case of lossless media the vertical part of branch cut (along imaginary axis of h) gives no
contribution to decay rates. From physical point of view it is due to the exponential decrease
of corresponding spherical waves when moving away from cylinder. For lossy media this
branch is very important because it describes nonradiative losses. The nonradiative decay
rates found in previous section (expressions (23)) is the asymptote of integral over the vertical
part of branch cut when ka moves to zero.

As it was mentioned above, in the dielectric case there is only ﬁnite number of guided
modes with longitudinal wavevectors between k and k√ε. Moreover, for small enough ﬁber

selves to the case of nanoﬁber, when condition (43) holds true.

To calculate decay rates into guided modes one should know the residues of corresponding
expression. These residues can be found if one know the asymptotic behavior of resonant
denominator near pole. In the case of nanoﬁber the denominator can be approximated by

Let us stress once more that the expressions (42) - (42), (45), (46) are valid in the case
of complex dielectric permittivity. In the case of metallic cylinder, that is in the case when
Re (ε) < 0, the poles of subintegral function are also near the real axis of h. But now
they corresponds to plasmon resonances. More detailed investigation of plasmon resonance
inﬂuence on decay rate will be presented in separate publication [35].

IV. DECAY RATES NEAR SURFACE OF NANOFIBER WITHOUT LOSSES.

The expressions (42) - (42) fully describe the problem of spontaneous emission of an atom
placed near cylinder made of any material. However, these expressions are too complicated
to understand real picture of decay rate. Our goal is to ﬁnd simple analytical expressions
allowing to estimate decay rate near cylinder with radius, which is substantially small in
comparison with wavelength, ka << 1. Moreover to obtained simple asymptotes we restricts
ourselves to the case of an atom placed on the surface (ρ′
a) of lossless dielectric cylinder.

V. GRAPHICS ILLUSTRATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

We should note before all that asymptotes (49) ,(53) and (56) do agree with quasistatic
0. It proves quasistatic calculations and conﬁrms complicated

results (17) in the limit ka
algebra of full electrodynamics case.

→

Another interesting case is the case of large dielectric permittivity. This case should be
treated carefully because the limits ka
do not commute. That is why one
can not use our asymptotes for large enough ε. To investigate the case of ε
, one should
take limit of general expressions (48), and only then investigate asymptotes for ka
0. The
analogous situation takes place in the case of planar interface [44] or for atom near prolate
nanospheroid [33,34].

These expressions are the main result of the work and allow to estimate decay rates of

an atom placed near nanoﬁber with ka

1.

≪

However, it is diﬃcult to say when these results are valid in practice. To ﬁnd region
of applicability of our results we calculated the decay rates according to full formulae and
compare them with asymptotes (57). The results of comparison are presented in Fig. 4-12.
First of all from the Fig. 4,7,10 one can see that our asymptotic expansions are good
enough for ka < 0.4(ε = 3) . When the dielectric permittivity is increased the region of
applicability of longwave asymptotes reduces. For ε = 10 (Fig. 5,8,11) applicability region
is ka < 0.1, while for ε = 30 (Fig. 6,9,12) applicability region is ka < 0.05. One can suppose
that generally our results are valid for

15

This region corresponds to very thin nanoﬁber. For example, for ε=3 ﬁber radius should

be about λ/20!

The rest of nanoﬁber radii,

ka < 1/ε.

1/ε < ka < 2.4/√ε

−

should be analyzed numerically (see Fig.4-12). From these ﬁgures one can see that for large
enough nanoﬁbers (59), the decay rates increase with increasing of dielectric permittivity.
The most substantial enhancement is observed for ρ and z orientations, where enhancement
of total decay rates can reach value about 35 and 23 for ε=30 (Fig.6,9). The most important
feature of ρ and z orientations of dipole momentum is very eﬃcient excitation of guided
modes. On the contrary, the inﬂuence of guided modes on spontaneous emission of ϕ-
oriented dipole is rather small.

To trace the inﬂuence of guided mode on total decay rate we plot the ratio of decay rate

into guided modes to total decay rate

This quantity is very important for determining the laser threshold [45]. From Fig. 13-
15 it is seen that the spontaneous emission coupling eﬃciency β is rather high for ρ and z
orientations even in the case of monomode nanoﬁbers! It is interesting that the asymptote
describes the coupling eﬃciency well in rather wide region (Fig.13). The dipoles with ϕ
orientations of momentum have the small spontaneous emission coupling eﬃciency (Fig.14)
Finally, In the Fig.16 the total decay rates near nanoﬁber are compared with decay
rates near ideally conducting cylinder. From this ﬁgures one can see that for large enough
dielectric permittivity the decay rate near nanoﬁber can be greater than decay rate near
ideally conducting cylinder. Again these eﬀect is due to excitation of principle mode in
nanoﬁber.

VI. CONCLUSION

In the present paper the decay rates of an excited atom placed near a dielectric ﬁber
is considered. The main attention was paid to the case of cylinder with radius which is
small in comparison with radiation wavelength (nanoﬁber), ka < 2.4/√ε
1. The decay
rates are found within quasistatic as well as full electrodynamics approaches. It is proved
that quasistatic approximation works well for nanoﬁber with ka < 1/ε.
In contrast to
quasistatic solution the exact one has additional terms from guided modes, which exists
even for nanoﬁber of arbitrary small radius. However the contributions from such modes
decreases exponentially when cylinder radius tends to zero. For large enough nanoﬁber,
1/ε < ka < 2.4/√ε

1, the inﬂuence of guided modes on the decay rate is substantial.

The results obtained can be useful as for estimation of decay rates and for understanding
of interplay between diﬀerent decay channels. The results obtained is in agreement with
those for an atom placed near dielectric or metallic nanospheroid

In present paper we pay attention to the case of dielectric nanoﬁber with positive dielec-
tric permittivity. However, our results can be applied to investigation of decay rates near
metallic nanowire with negative dielectric constant. In the case of nanowires the quasistatic
expressions (16) remain valid, but one should add to them contribution, which is due to
excitation of plasmon resonances. The detailed analysis of decay rates of an atom placed
near nanowires will be presented elsewhere [35].

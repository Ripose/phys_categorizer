Abstract

We study the scattering of an electron from an inverted Gaussian atomic potential in
the presence of strong time periodic electric ﬁelds. Using Floquet theory, we construct the
Floquet Scattering matrix in the Kramers-Henneberger frame. We compute the transmission
coeﬃcients as a function of electron incident energy and ﬁnd that they display asymmetric
Fano resonances due to the electron interaction with the driving ﬁeld. We ﬁnd that the
Fano resonances are associated with zero-pole pairs of the Floquet Scattering matrix in the
complex energy plane. Another way we “probe” the complex spectrum of the system is
by computing the Wigner delay times. Finally we ﬁnd that the eigenphases of the Floquet
Scattering matrix undergo a number of “avoided crossings” as a function of electron incident
energy that increases with increasing strength of the driving ﬁeld. These “avoided crossings”
appear to be quantum manifestations of the destruction of the constants of motion and the
onset of chaos in classical phase space.

I. INTRODUCTION

The development of ultra-high intensity lasers has led to the study of atoms in external
time periodic electric ﬁelds that are comparable in strength to the electric ﬁelds produced by
the atomic nucleus. One of the most interesting phenomena observed in these time periodic
systems is the suppression of the ionization rate with increasing laser intensity that was
predicted theoretically [1–3] and has been veriﬁed experimentally [4,5].

In previous studies, one dimensional atomic potentials have been used to predict sev-
eral phenomena in the theory of laser-atom interactions at high laser intensities. Many of
these studies were carried out in the context of Floquet theory formulated in the Kramers-
Henneberger (K-H) frame of reference [6,7], which oscillates with a free electron in the time
periodic ﬁeld. Gavrila and Kaminski [1] developed a nonperturbative method to study elec-
tron scattering in the presence of strong time-periodic electric ﬁelds. Bhatt, Pireaux and
Burnett [8] in their work on electron scattering from a polarization potential in the pres-
ence of strong monochromatic light, argued the appearance of new light-induced quasibound
states as the ﬁeld strength is increased. The same phenomenon was later also observed by
Bardsley and Comella [9] and Yao and Chu [10] who used the complex coordinate scaling

1

transformation to compute the complex quasibound states in their study of photodetach-
ment from a one-dimensional Gaussian potential. In addition, the same atomic potential
was used by Marinescu and Gavrila [11] to compare the predictions of the full Floquet theory
with those of the high-frequency Floquet theory (HFFT), using resonance (Siegert) bound-
ary conditions. (The HFFT theory is a version of the Floquet approach adapted to treat
the high frequency limit.) Recently, Timberlake and Reichl [12], using the inverted Gaus-
sian potential, studied the phase-space picture of resonance creation and they showed that
the light-induced quasibound states are scarred on unstable periodic orbits of the classical
motion.

In this paper, we study the scattering of an electron from a short range atomic potential
in the presence of a strong time periodic electric ﬁeld. The atomic potential we consider is
the one-dimensional inverted Gaussian potential, a model that has already oﬀered interesting
insights into diﬀerent aspects of the laser-atom interactions [9–11]. Our goal is to construct
the Floquet Scattering matrix (S-matrix) using the full Floquet theory formulated in the
K-H frame for a strongly driven atomic system. A Floquet Scattering matrix has been
constructed by Li and Reichl [13] for periodically driven mesoscopic systems. The Floquet
S-matrix connects the outgoing propagating modes to the incoming propagating modes and
is a unitary matrix which conserves probability. We construct the Floquet S-matrix in the
K-H frame where we can deﬁne asymptotic states.

In section II, we construct the Floquet S-matrix in the K-H frame.

In section III.A
we compute the transmission coeﬃcients and the poles of the Floquet S-matrix and ﬁnd
the quasibound states of the atomic system. In section III.B we compute the Wigner delay
times of the scattered electron as a function of the incident energy and show that the
Wigner delay times of the scattered electron due to the presence of the quasibound states
are of the same order of magnitude as the lifetimes obtained from the poles of the Floquet S-
matrix. We ﬁnish, in section III.C, with a quite interesting observation. When plotting the
eigenphases of the unitary Floquet S-matrix as a function of the electron’s incident energy
we ﬁnd that at certain energies the eigenphases undergo “avoided crossings” that change the
eigenphases character completely. We ﬁnd that the number of “avoided crossings” increases
with increasing strength of the time periodic electric ﬁeld. The “avoided crossings” observed
as the strength of the driving ﬁeld is increased appear to be quantum manifestations of the
destruction of the KAM surfaces and the onset of chaos in the classical phase space.

II. THE FLOQUET S-MATRIX

A. The model

We study the scattering of an electron in the presence of a strong electric ﬁeld and a
short-range atomic potential. The electric ﬁeld E(t) = E0 sin(ωt) (T = 2π
ω is the period of
the ﬁeld) is treated within the dipole approximation as a monochromatic inﬁnite plane wave
linearly polarized along the direction of the incident electron. The Schr¨odinger equation, in
one space dimension x, that describes the dynamics of the system is in atomic units (a.u.)

We use atomic units (e = ¯h = m = 1) throughout this paper, except when otherwise
indicated.

To construct the Floquet S-matrix of the system, we transform to the K-H frame [6,7].
In the K-H frame there are well deﬁned asymptotic regions and the boundary conditions are
expressed in terms of free electron waves. To obtain the wave function in the K-H frame we
introduce the unitary transformation [6,7]

In Eq.(6), the potential is a periodic function of time, that is V (x+a(t)) = V (x+a(t+T )).

Thus, according to the Floquet theorem [14], Eq.(6) has solutions of the form

must be smooth functions in the one space dimension x in the K-H frame. This is indeed
the case for the laterally oscillating inverted Gaussian potential, Eq.(11).

From Eq.(11), we see that the components Vn(α0; x) of the atomic potential in the limit
tend to zero faster than 1/x and we can thus divide the one space dimension x

In the asymptotic regions I and III the potential V (x + α(t)) is zero. Thus, we can

evanescent modes is zero. Note that the probability amplitudes bin and ain of the evanescent
modes in Eqs.(20) and (21) are zero because they satisfy unphysical boundary conditions
in the asymptotic regions I and III. For the Floquet S-matrix to be unitary we need to
normalize the current density of the propagating modes. To do so, we have introduced the
constants 1/√kn in the wavefunction in Eqs.(20) and (21). To simplify notation in Eqs.(20)
and (21), we introduce the constants 1/√kn for the evanescent modes as well, even though
they have zero current density.

|E

It is important to note, once again, that the reason we choose to work in the K-H frame is
that in this frame we can deﬁne asymptotic regions where the potential is zero and thus, the
Floquet channels are not coupled, in contrast with the scattering region, as we have already
shown. The existence of the asymptotic regions guarantees that probability is conserved
in the truncated number of Floquet channels and thus the Floquet S-matrix is a unitary
matrix.

D. Floquet S-matrix

The Floquet S-matrix connects the outgoing propagating modes with the incoming prop-
agating modes, and in this section we show how to construct it. The wavefunction and its

In this section we have shown how to construct the Floquet S-matrix in the K-H frame.
The reason we work in the K-H frame is that we can deﬁne asymptotic regions where the
wavefunction is a superposition of free electron waves. That guarantees that the truncated
Floquet S-matrix is a unitary matrix, that is, the following condition is satisﬁed

for every incident propagating mode n = 0, ..., np. The above condition is a statement of
conservation of probability. Also, the Floquet S-matrix we construct in the K-H frame is
isospectral with the corresponding matrix in the lab frame since a unitary transformation is
used to transform from the lab to the K-H frame, see section II.A. Finally, the criterion we
use to successfully truncate to N Floquet channels is that an electron wave incident on the
last propagating Floquet channel n = np is not aﬀected by the scattering potential. That is,
2 should be equal to one as a function of electron incident
the transmission coeﬃcient
energy E ( E =

III. RESULTS

In this section, the calculations are performed with the values V0 = 0.27035 a.u. and δ =
2 a.u. assigned to the parameters of the inverted Gaussian potential. For these parameters
0.1327 a.u. in the
the Gaussian potential supports only one bound state of energy Eb =
ﬁeld-free case. The parameters V0 and δ were chosen so as to describe the behavior of a
one-dimensional model negative chlorine ion, Cl−, in the presence of a laser ﬁeld, and are the
same as considered in [10,11,15]. The frequency of the time periodic ﬁeld is taken constant
and equal to ω = 0.236 a.u for all our calculations. For these values of the parameters V0, δ
and ω the inverted Gaussian potential has been shown to exhibit suppression of ionization
[10,11].

coeﬃcient Ttot as a function of the electron incident energy E, where

with n = 0, 1. Thus, we consider an electron wave incident from the right with energy
E
[0, 2ω) and compute the transmission coeﬃcients. Keeping the frequency of the time
periodic ﬁeld constant, ω = 0.236 a.u., and varying the strength of the driving ﬁeld, a0, we
plot the transmission coeﬃcients T0 and Ttot in Figs.(3), (4) and (5) for α0 equal to 0.5,
2.25 and 5.25, respectively. The frequency of the driving ﬁeld ω = 0.236 a.u. is chosen so
a.u. in the
that it is larger than the binding energy of the ground state
ﬁeld-free case. The Floquet channels we retain to obtain the numerical results presented in
sections III.A and III.B are n =

and n =
19, ..., 0, ..., 19 for α0 = 5.25, for reasons we discuss in detail at the end of section

The transmission coeﬃcients T0 and Ttot display sharp asymmetric resonances, as a
function of electron incident energy E, that involve a dip or a transmission peak/dip as
is shown in Figs.(3), (4) and (5). These asymmetric resonances are due to the interaction
of the incident electron wave with the laterally oscillating potential in the K-H frame and
are the so-called Fano [16,17] type transmission resonances that are known to occur when a
bound state is coupled to a continuum of states. This is indeed the case for the scattering

9

model we consider, where the bound state of the inverted Gaussian potential is coupled to
a continuum of states through the time periodic electric ﬁeld. Note in Figs.(3), (4) and (5)
that the diﬀerence between the transmission coeﬃcient T0 and Ttot becomes more prominent
with increasing α0. The reason is that as α0 is increased more Floquet channels interfere with
the incident electron wave and signiﬁcantly contribute to the total transmission coeﬃcient.
A comparison of Fig.(3) with Figs.(4) and (5) reveals that as the driving ﬁeld is increased
the higher order resonances, for E > ω, become stronger.

We now focus on the transmission coeﬃcient T0 and discuss how it “probes” the qua-
sibound states of the system. For α0 = 0.5, see Fig.(3a) the system has only one Fano
transmission resonance which for small amplitude of the driving ﬁeld is associated with
the n =
1 localized Floquet evanescent mode which has its origin in the bound state of
the undriven system. When the strength of the driving ﬁeld is increased, T0 has a second
Fano transmission resonance at a higher incident energy, see Figs.(4a) and (5a). This sec-
ond resonance appears for a0 > 1, as was shown in [10,11], and it is thus a ﬁeld induced
resonance.

−

The Fano-resonances, which are indicated by a dip or a transmission peak/dip in the
coeﬃcient T0 , correspond to quasibound states of the system that show up as poles of the
Floquet S-matrix in the complex energy plane. In what follows, we compute the poles of
T0 in the complex energy plane. Other elements of the Floquet S-matrix have poles as well.
As was noted in [18] the asymmetric Fano line shape in T0 is associated with zero-pole pairs
when plotting T0 in the complex energy plane. For α0 = 0.5 there is only one zero-pole pair
associated with the single transmission resonance seen in T0 , see Figs.(3a) and (6), while for
α0 = 2.25 there is a zero-pole pair for each of the two resonances, see Figs.(4a) and (7). Note
that for small strengths of the driving ﬁeld, α0 = 0.5, the location of the pole on the lower
half energy plane and of the zero on the real energy axis is the same, while there is a small
diﬀerence for stronger ﬁelds, α0 = 2.25. That is why, we can only approximately determine
the real part of the quasibound states from the transmission zeros. From the poles in the
complex energy plane, see Figs.(6) and (7), we ﬁnd the real part of the quasibound states
to be Re(E1) = 0.106, for α0 = 0.5, and Re(E1) = 0.145, Re(E2) = 0.226, for α0 = 2.25.

The lifetime, τL of the quasibound states is determined from the imaginary part of the

complex energy, Im(E), where the pole is found. Then

τL =

1
Γ

,

(39)

where Γ = 2Im(E) is the ionization rate. For the inverted Gaussian potential it has been
found that with increasing strength of the driving ﬁeld the ionization rate decreases in an
oscillatory manner [10,11]. In Figs.(8) and (9) we show how the real and imaginary part of
the quasibound state energies change as a function of α0, for α0 ranging from 0 to 6 a.u..
The incident particle can emit a photon and drop to a localized Floquet evanescent state. It
is in this sense that in Fig.(8) we plot the real part of the quasibound state minus a photon
energy and obtain results in agreement with those obtained in [10,11].

B. Wigner delay times

In this section we compute the Wigner delay times which are a measure of the time
that the electron is delayed due to its interaction with the scattering potential. In our case,
the scattering potential is the laterally oscillating time periodic potential in the K-H frame.
At the transmission resonances, the incident electron wave gets trapped by the oscillating
potential, populating the quasibound states of the system. The delay of the incident electron
wave at the transmission resonances shows up as peaks when plotting the Wigner delay times
as a function of the electron incident energy. To compute the Wigner delay times, we ﬁrst
obtain the eigenvalues of the Floquet S-matrix, see Eq.(33), which is a 2(np + 1)
2(np + 1)
matrix when the system is truncated to np + 1 propagating modes. The eigenvalues of
the unitary Floquet S-matrix have unit magnitude and can thus be cast in the form eiθi(E),
where i = 1, ..., 2(np +1) and θi(E) is the ith eigenphase as a function of the electron incident
energy E. Once we obtain the eigenphases we ﬁnd the partial Wigner delay times using

×

w is given in a.u. units. The total Wigner delay time is given by

dθi
dE

,

2(np+1)

τw =

w.

(40)

(41)

Xi=1
In Figs.(10), (11) and (12) we plot the Wigner delay times for α0 equal to 0.5, 2.25 and 5.25,
respectively. In Table I we compare the Wigner delay times τw obtained from the Floquet
S-matrix with the lifetime τL obtained from the poles of the T0 transmission coeﬃcient in
the complex energy plane and ﬁnd them to be of the same order of magnitude [19]. Note
that as α0 increases from 2.25 to 5.25 the Wigner delay time of the 1st quasibound state
increases, evidence of suppression of ionization. Another interesting observation is that for
small incident energy E the electron has positive Wigner delay times, for α0 = 0.5, but the
electron has negative Wigner delays times for strong driving ﬁelds α0 = 2.25 and 5.25. These
last can arise physically either from reﬂection of the incident electron before it enters the
scattering region or from its acceleration and swift passage through the negative potential
[20].

Now, let us brieﬂy comment on the truncation error of our numerical calculations. The
number of Floquet channels N was chosen for each value of α0 so that the error due to
truncation remains small. The truncation error for the elements Rn′,n/Tn′,n, where n′, n =
0, ..., np, is smaller for n = 0 and it increases as n
np, where np is the last propagating
mode and thus the mode with the larger electron incident energy. Thus, the truncation error
for the transmission coeﬃcients T0 and Ttot computed in section III.A is smaller than the
error for the Wigner delay times computed in this section. An estimate of the truncation
2 as a function of incident electron energy. In all our calculations
error is given by 1
the truncation error is kept small so that our results are reliable. As we increase α0 we need
to consider a larger number of Floquet channels N to maintain a small truncation error in
our numerical calculations making it computationally challenging to compute the Wigner
delay times for large values of α0.

C. Classical-Quantum Correspondence

When we plot the eigenphases of the Floquet S-matrix as a function of the electron
incident energy we notice that the eigenphases undergo an increasing number of “avoided
crossings” with increasing strength α0 of the driving ﬁeld, see Figs.(13), (15), and (16). As we
show in what follows, we believe that these “avoided crossings” are a quantum manifestation
of chaos in the classical phase space.

Let us explain what we mean by the term “avoided crossing”. For every electron incident

energy E, the Floquet S-matrix has 2(np + 1) eigenvalues eiθi and eigenvectors

In Fig.(13) the eigenphases θ1 and θ2 undergo a repulsion when the incident energy is
equal to the transmission resonance, E = 0.106, for α0 = 0.5. For very small values of α0
the eigenphases cross each other without repelling. It is only as we increase the strength of
the driving ﬁeld that the eigenphases undergo a repulsion which we refer to as an “avoided
crossing”. We describe quantitatively the “avoided crossing” between the eigenphases θ1 and
θ2 in terms of occupation probabilities. In Fig.(14a) we plot the occupation probabilities
θ1 > eigenvector on the propagating channels n=0,1,2 and in
P0,1, P1,1 and P2,1 of the
Fig.(14b) we plot the occupation probabilities P0,2, P1,2 and P2,2 of the

0.5, while after the “avoided

P1,1 ≈
crossing”, E > 0.106,
0.5,
0.5. This total exchange of character
and
is what we refer to as a sharp “avoided crossing”. Note that for α0 = 0.5 the propagating
channels that interfere in the “avoided crossing” are mainly n = 0, 1. As the strength of the
driving ﬁeld α0 is increased an increasing number of propagating channels interfere in the
“avoided crossings”, as shown in Tables II and III.

For increased strength of the driving ﬁeld the number of avoided crossings increases, see
Figs.(15), (16) and it can be that more than two eigenphases participate in an “avoided
crossing” for a certain incident energy. For example, this is the case for the “avoided

12

≈

0.14, for α0 = 2.25, where there are three eigenphases θ1, θ2 and θ6
crossing” at E
interfering, see Fig.(16). In Figs.(15) and (16) we plot the eigenphases of the Floquet S-
matrix as a function of E for α0 = 1.25 and α0 = 2.25, respectively, to show the increase in
the number of “avoided crossings” with increasing strength of the driving ﬁeld. In Tables II
and III we present for α0 = 1.25 and α0 = 2.25, respectively, the eigephases which undergo
“avoided crossings” for diﬀerent incident electron energies E and the propagating channels
n = 0, 1, ... for which the occupation probability Pn,i is substantial. In Tables II and III, the
channels with small occupation probabilities are indicated as subscripts to the channels with
large occupation probabilities. This is only an approximate picture but helps us visualize
how the eigenphases change character at the “avoided crossings”. For example, from table
III, we obtain an approximate picture how the eigenphases θ1, θ2 and θ6 participate in the
θ1 > has support mainly
“avoided crossing” at E
0.14. For E = 0.07, the eigenvector

mainly on the propagating channel n = 0 and less on n = 1, the eigenvector
θ6 > has
support mainly on the propagating channel n = 3 and less on n = 5, 1. For E = 0.145, the

eigenvector
θ2 > has support mainly on the propagating channels n = 1, 3 and less on
the eigenvector
θ6 > has support mainly on the propagating channels n = 1, 3. Thus,
n = 5, the eigenvector
there is an exchange of character among the eigenphases θ1, θ2 and θ6 expressed in terms of
the mainly interfering channels n = 0, 1, 3, 5 but it is not a complete exchange as in the case
of the sharp “avoided crossing” at α0 = 0.5, see Fig.(13). The “avoided crossings” we have
just described for the open quantum system under consideration, the inverted Gaussian in
the presence of a driving ﬁeld, are analogous to what was seen in a bounded chaotic system
[21] where the authors also discuss two diﬀerent types of “avoided crossings”.

We now turn to the classical dynamics of the inverted Gaussian potential in the presence
of the driving ﬁeld. Figs.(17) are strobe plots of the phase space dynamics, for constant
frequency ω = 0.236 and increasing strength of the driving ﬁeld, α0 is equal to 0.5, 1.25
and 2.25. The strobe plots are drawn by evolving a set of trajectories, with diﬀerent initial
conditions, and plotting the location of each trajectory at time intervals (tn = 2πm/ω,
m = 1, 2, ...) equal to the period of the driving ﬁeld. We indicate the location of the period-
1 periodic orbits with ﬁlled squares. The strobe plots are drawn in the Lab frame, see
Eqs.(1), (2) and (3), and are exactly the same with those in the K-H frame except that in
the lab frame the x axis is shifted by α0 [22]. If no driving ﬁeld is present, the motion is
regular and bounded for negative energies, while it is unbounded for positive energies. When
the driving ﬁeld is turned on, the KAM tori in the regular island around x = 0, p = 0 start
breaking up as α0 is increased and chaotic motion sets in. For α0 = 0.5, see Fig.(17a), the
classical phase space is mixed. There are two islands around the two stable periodic orbits
but there are also chaotic trajectories. As α0 is further increased the remaining islands are
very small, see Fig.(17b), until they totally disappear, see Figs.(17c), and the phase space
in the scattering region becomes dominated by chaos. In addition, in Figs.(18a) and (18b)
where the initial values of the classical momenta are chosen to correspond to the middle
of the Floquet propagating channels, we ﬁnd that as α0 is increased more trajectories get
pulled into the chaotic region of the classical phase space. Correspondingly, in the quantum
treatment of the scattering problem we have seen that as the strength of the driving ﬁeld is
increased the eigenphases of the Floquet S-matrix undergo an increasing number of “avoided

13

crossings” where more Floquet channels contribute to the scattering process. We thus believe
that the “avoided crossings” are a quantum manifestation of the breaking of the constants
of motion and chaos setting in in the classical phase space.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have studied the scattering of electron waves from an inverted Gaussian
potential, used to model the atomic potential, in the presence of strong time periodic electric
ﬁelds. Using Floquet theory, we have constructed the Floquet S-matrix in the K-H frame,
where asymptotic states can be deﬁned. We have computed the transmission resonances,
for diﬀerent strengths of the driving ﬁeld, and shown that they are associated with zero-
pole pairs of the Floquet S-matrix in the complex energy plane. We have also computed
the Wigner delay times which is a diﬀerent way to “probe” the complex spectrum of the
open quantum system. Finally, we have shown that the eigenphases of the open quantum
system undergo a number of “avoided crossings” as a function of the electron incident energy,
that increases with increasing strength of the driving ﬁeld. We believe that the “avoided
crossings” are quantum manifestations of the destruction of the KAM surfaces and the onset
of chaos in the classical phase space.

independent functions in the scattering region II. For the inverted Gaussian potential the
functions χn,j(x) can only be obtained numerically. In Appendix A we formally expressed
the matrices r and t in terms of the functions χn,j(x). Numerically, though, it is not eﬃcient
to compute the functions χn,j(x). In what follows we outline the numerical method [8] we
use to obtain the N

to the Numerov algorithm [23]. The Numerov algorithm yields φ(x) at the s + 1 integration
step using the values of φ(x) at two previous steps

Abstract

The Conﬁguration Interaction method is applied to investigate the possibility of
positron binding to the metastable beryllium (1s22s2p 3Po) state. The largest cal-
culation obtained an estimated energy that was unstable by 0.00014 Hartree with
respect to the Ps + Be+(2s) lowest dissociation channel. It is likely that positron
binding to parent states with non-zero angular momentum is inhibited by centrifugal
barriers.

Key words: positron, positron binding, positronic atom, atomic structure,

1 Introduction

In the last several years there has been substantial progress studying the
physics of positron binding to atoms. As late as 1997, there was no rigorous
evidence for existence of positron-atom bound states [1], although the pos-
sibility of positron binding had been often invoked to explain the existence
of very large annihilation rates for positrons annihilating in gases [2,3,4,5,6].
Towards the end of 1997, positron binding to atomic lithium was established
in two independent calculations [7,8]. Following these initial studies, positron
binding to a further 10 elements of the periodic table was demonstrated [9].

One of the features of these positronic atoms is that all the atoms binding a
positron have ionization potentials close to 6.80 eV (the Ps binding energy)
and the binding energies are generally larger for the atoms with their ioniza-
tion energies closest to 6.80 eV.

A related question is whether positrons can form bound states with excited
electronic states. There is one excited atomic state known to bind a positron,
namely the metastable He(3Se) state [10,11]. The stability of e+He(3Se) state
was established with the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) [12,13,7] fol-
lowing an initial inconclusive study by Drachman et al [14].

The answer to this question is relevant to positron-atom collision physics [15],
since such states may manifest themselves as Feshbach resonances in the elastic
or excitation cross sections. There has been a suggestion that the rich resonant
structures prominent in electron-atom scattering [16] are largely absent from
the positron-atom spectrum [17,9,15].

This work investigates the possibility of positron binding to the low-lying
triplet odd state of neutral beryllium, i.e. the Be(1s22s2p 3Po) system. This
state has been identiﬁed as one of the most likely excited states to bind a
positron [18,9]. This conjecture has largely been based upon the fact that
its ionization potential (IP) of 6.598 eV [19] is quite close to the Ps binding
energy. This IP is between that of magnesium and calcium, both of which
bind a positron with a binding energy of ≈ 0.4 eV [9,20,21]. Furthermore,
the dipole polarisability of Be(3Po) is αd = 39.02 a3
0 [22], greater than that of
ground state Be (αd = 37.7 a3

0 [23]).

This metastable state warrants investigation for another reason; the parent
atom has an angular momentum greater than zero with the loosely bound 2p
electron carrying the angular momentum. The quantitative impact that the
angular momenta has on the ability to bind a positron is largely unknown.
Angular momentum coupling considerations suggests that the existence of a
repulsive centrifugal barrier will act to inhibit positron binding by making it
less energetically favorable to form a Ps-cluster. Either, the electron-positron
pair will be in a relative p-state with a smaller energy gain than the Ps(1s)
state, or the total angular momentum of the Ps cluster relative to the nucleus
will be greater than zero.

2 Details of the Calculation

Since the ionization energy of the Be(2s2p 3Po) system is just less than 6.80 eV,
the threshold for a stable positron complex is that for the Be+(2s) + Ps(1s)
dissociation channel. This energy was −0.9192086 Hartree for the present

2

model potential. An energy level diagram showing the ground and low-lying
metastable states of Be, and some negative ion and positronic ion energies are
shown in Figure 1.

The CI method as applied to positron-atomic systems with two valence elec-
trons and a positron has been discussed previously [24,25,20], but a short de-
scription is worthwhile. The model Hamiltonian is initially based on a Hartree-
Fock (HF) wave function for the neutral atom ground state. One- and two-
body semi-empirical polarization potentials are added to the potential ﬁeld of
the HF core and the parameters of the core-polarization potentials deﬁned by
reference to the spectrum of Be+ [26].

All calculations were done in the frozen-core approximation. The general ef-
fective Hamiltonian for the system with Ne valence electrons and a positron
was

The direct potential (Vdir) represents the interaction with the HF 1s2 electron
core. The direct part of the core potential is attractive for electrons and re-
pulsive for the positron. The exchange potential (Vexc) between the valence
electrons and the HF core was computed without approximation.

The one-body polarization potential (Vp1) was a semi-empirical polarization
potential derived from an analysis of the Be+ spectrum. It has the functional
form

Vp1(r) = −

αdg2(r)
2r4

.

The factor αd is the static dipole polarizability of the core and g2(r) is a cutoﬀ
function designed to make the polarization potential ﬁnite at the origin. The
same cutoﬀ function has been adopted for both the positron and electrons. In
this work, g2(r) was deﬁned to be

g2(r) = 1 − exp(cid:16)−r6/ρ6

(cid:17) ,

where ρ is an adjustable cutoﬀ parameter. The core dipole polarizability was
set to 0.0523 a3
0 while ρ was set to 0.95 a0 [25]. The two-body polarization
potential (Vp2) is deﬁned as

This model potential gives a Be(2s2p 3Po) binding energy of 0.91147 Hartree
with respect to the Be2+ threshold. The experimental binding energy with
respect to this threshold is 0.91888 Hartree [27].

The CI basis was constructed by letting the two electrons and the positron
form all the possible total angular momentum LT = 1 conﬁgurations, with the
two electrons in a spin-triplet state, subject to the selection rules, namely

max(ℓ0, ℓ1, ℓ2) ≤ Lmax
min(ℓ1, ℓ2) ≤ Lint
(−1)(ℓ0+ℓ1+ℓ2) = −1

(5)
(6)

(7)

In these rules ℓ0, ℓ1 and ℓ2 are respectively the orbital angular momenta of
the positron and the two electrons.

Our two-electron-positron calculations with non-zero total angular momen-
tum were ﬁrst validated against the previous LT = 1 and 2 PsH calculations
of Tachikawa [28]. Using their Gaussian-type orbitals we reproduced their re-
ported energy and annihilation rates. Note that the PsH states with LT = 1
and 2 are unbound [29,28,30].

For the e+Be(3Po) calculations, the Hamiltonian was diagonalized in a CI basis
constructed from a very large number of single particle orbitals, including
orbitals up to ℓ = 12. There was a minimum of 12 radial basis functions for
each ℓ. The largest calculation was performed with Lmax = 12 and Lint = 3 and
gave a CI basis dimension of 498750. The resulting Hamiltonian matrix was
diagonalized with the Davidson algorithm [31], and a total of 1376 iterations
were required for the largest calculation.

3 Results

Various e+Be(3Po) expectation values, such as energy and mean distance of
the electron and positron from the nucleus are given in Table 1. The 2γ annihi-
lation rate [9] for annihilation with the core and valence electrons are denoted
Γc and Γv respectively. The calculations shown in Table 1 have a minimum of
12 radial basis functions for each ℓ with Lmax = 12 and Lint = 3. The largest
calculation remains unbound by −0.0021904 Hartree.

To demonstrate that Lint = 3 is suﬃcient for this system, also shown in Table
1 is the result of a Lmax = 12 and Lint = 2 calculation. The Lmax parameter
needs to be large since it determines the extent to which electron-positron
correlations are incorporated into the wavefunction. However, Lint is largely
concerned with electron-electron correlations and, for example, setting Lint = 3

4

for the PsH and e+Be ground states recovered 99.4% and 98.5% respectively
of the Ps and positron binding energies for a given Lmax [25].

The main problem aﬄicting CI calculations of positron-atom interactions is
the slow convergence of the expectation values with Lmax [32,33,9,34]. One
way to determine the Lmax → ∞ expectation values is to assume that the
successive increments, ∆XL, to any expectation value hXi scale as 1/Lp as
L increases [32]. However, arguments based on 2nd-order perturbation theory
2)pE ≈
suggests that the energy increments scale asymptotically as 1/(L + 1
1/(L + 1
2)4 [35,36]. While existing CI calculations are consistent with this idea
[25,37,34,38], the actual size of the exponent, pE is signiﬁcantly smaller than
4 at Lmax ≈ 10. This can be seen in Table 1, where the power law factor pE
relating successive E(Lmax −2), E(Lmax−1), and E(Lmax) are tabulated. Ap-
plying a simple power law extrapolation with pE = 2.078 leads to a prediction
of binding (E = −0.9207021), but not much credence should be placed in this
since ﬁxing pE at its Lmax = 12 value of 2.078 will result in an extrapolation
that will overestimate the contribution of the orbitals with L > Lmax [39,34].

An improved method, borrowing from existing work in atomic structure physics
[40,41,21], is to estimate the Lmax → ∞ limit for the energy by assuming that

∆EL ≈

AE
(L + 1

2)4 +

BE
(L + 1

2)5 +

CE
(L + 1

2 )6 .

(8)

The factors AE, BE and CE are determined from four calculations at suc-
cessively larger values of Lmax. Applying eq. (8) to the data in Table 1 at
Lmax = 12 one ﬁnds AE = −34.601, BE = 477.71 and CE = −1829.3, with
E = −0.919070 Hartree as our present best energy estimate. This is 0.0001390
Hartree higher the threshold for binding at −0.9192086 Hartree.

Usage of an inverse power series restricted to the ﬁrst two terms of eq. (8)
results in AE = −21.875 and BE = 172.29, and an e+Be(3Po) energy of
E = −0.9188267, which is also unbound. As has been seen in other CI calcu-
lations of positron-atom systems, even when the three-term and the two-term
coeﬃcents are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, their extrapolated energies can still lie
relatively close together [34].

There are two aspects where convergence can be incomplete. Besides the size of
Lmax, the number of LTOs for each value of ℓ still needs to be further increased.
This is best seen in Figure 2 which depicts the energies as a function of Lmax.
Two sets of e+Be(3Po) data are shown, the ﬁrst shows the e+Be(3Po) energies
from Table 1 which used 12 LTOs, and their extrapolated estimates using
eq. (8). The second set shows the results from initial exploratory calculations
also with Lmax = 12 and Lint = 3, but only with a minimum of 8 LTOs
per ℓ. Even a cursory glance at Figure 2 suggests that the CI prognosis for
variationally establishing the existence of a bound state is not promising. Also

5

shown in Figure 2 are the Be(3Po) energies using the underlying e+Be(3Po)
basis without the positron (the 12 LTOs basis).

Even though the valence annihilation rate from the largest calculation is only
0.348 × 109 sec−1, the slow convergence of Γv with Lmax suggests the presence
of a well deﬁned Ps cluster. Fitting the four largest Γv calculations in Table 1
to the three-term form

∆ΓL ≈

AΓ
(L + 1

2 )2 +

BΓ
(L + 1

2 )3 +

CΓ
(L + 1

2)4 ,

(9)

results in an extrapolated annihilation rate of Γv = 0.805×109 sec−1. However,
this value should be regarded as only notional. After all, if this system is indeed
unbound, Γv should approach ΓPs = 2.008×109 sec−1 in the limit of an inﬁnite
radial basis [42].

It is also noticed that hrpi in Table 1 steadily decreases as Lmax increases. This
also should not be taken as an indicator of binding since the behavior of hrpi
with Lmax is not straightforward. For example, the PsH hrpi decreases when
Lmax changes from 0 to 3, but then starts increasing as Lmax increases from 3 to
9 [25,34]. Indeed, this is a trend noticed in CI calculations of positronic atoms
with IP < 6.8eV (eg. e+Li [43], e+Ca and e+Sr [20,38]), which have shown an
initial hrpi decrease to a minimum, which then increases as Lmax → ∞. The
behavior of hrpi with Lmax for an unbound system is unknown.

4 Conclusions

A large-scale CI calculation of the e+Be(3Po) ground state has been performed.
The largest calculation gave an energy that was 0.00219 Hartree above the
threshold for binding. Using an extrapolation method to estimate the contri-
bution from the higher-partial waves gave an energy that was 0.00014 Hartree
above threshold. By its very nature the present calculation is unable to give
deﬁnitive proof that the e+Be(3Po) system does not have a bound state. While
a variational calculation of the present kind can be used to give proof of bind-
ing, it cannot be used to give proof of non-binding. A converged calculation
of low energy Be+-Ps(1s) scattering in the 4Po channel would be needed to
establish lack of binding.

What can be inferred from the present calculation is that a e+Be(3Po) bound
state (assuming one existed) would have a structure similar to positronic
lithium, i.e. it would consist of a Ps-like object weakly bound to the Be+(2s)
core. The size of the CI expansion required to establish binding would be enor-
mous. For example, it is necessary to include orbitals with Lmax ≈ 30 to get
an energy that is lower than the Ps + Li+ threshold [43]. Another conclusion

6

is that the existence of centrifugal barriers does seem to inhibit the binding
of positrons to parent atoms with non-zero angular momentum.

Fig. 2. The energy (in units of Hartree) of e+-Be(3Po) (crosses) and extrapolated
energies (diamonds) as a function of Lmax for two diﬀerent calculations (with a mini-
mum of 8 and 12 LTOs per ℓ respectively). The Be(3Po) two-electron energy is shown
by the squares for the 12 LTOs basis. The threshold for binding at E(Be+)+E(Ps)
is shown as solid line.

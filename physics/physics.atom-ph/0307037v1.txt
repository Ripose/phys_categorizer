I would like to comment on a recent paper[1] pub-
lished in Phys. Rev. A. In that paper, the author has
tried to establish the following main conclusion: Both
the standard perturbation series and the expanded Mag-
nus exponential operator lead to the result of Franson and
Donegan [2] for Heisenberg operators. He establishes this
conclusion through second order and presents a concrete
example to convince the readers that the conclusion must
be true in all orders. Here, I would like to point out that
the author’s conclusion is indeed true in all orders. To
prove this claim, one just need to observe that the formal
perturbation series for Heisenberg operators is unique.
The uniqueness is due to the fact that the initial value
problem for a linear 1st ordinary diﬀerential equation has
a unique (formal) solution.

Recall that the evolution operator is the unique solu-

tion for

dU
dt = λAU

(cid:26)

U (0) = I

(1)

where I is the identity operator, λ is an imaginary param-
eter 1
i~ , and A is a hermitian operator (the Hamiltonian
in the Schrodinger picture) and could be time dependent.
For any hermitian operator ˆO in the quantum system,
ρr(U )( ˆO) ≡ U † ˆOU .
we let τ (λA)( ˆO) ≡ [O, λA] and
(Both τ (λA) and ρr(U ) are operators on the space of
hermitian operators of the quantum system.) Recall that
(hermitian)operator ˆO in the Schrodinger picture and the
corresponding operator ˆOH in the Heisenberg picture are
related via equation ˆOH = ρr(U )( ˆO). The initial value
problem we mentioned early is

d
dt ρr(U ) = ρr(U )τ (λA)
ρr(U (0)) =

I.

(cid:26)

(2)

and it has the following unique formal perturbative so-
lution:

ρr(U (t)) = I +

dnt τ (λA(t1)) · · · τ (λA(tn)),(3)

Z∆n(t)

Xn≥1

where ∆n(t) ≡ {(t1, . . . , tn) ∈ Rn | 0 ≤ t1 ≤ · · · ≤ tn ≤
t}. Consequently, by using the deﬁnition of τ (λA), we
have ˆOH ≡ ρr(U (t))( ˆO) is equal to

= ˆO +

λn

dnt [· · · [ ˆO, A(tn)], . . . , A(t1)].(4)

Xn≥1

Z∆n(t)

(Note that, equation (4) with A = H and λ = 1
i~ , be-
ing identical to equation (6) in [2], is the main result of
Franson and Donegan.)

In view of the uniqueness of the formal expansion for
ρr(U (t)), it is now clear that the conclusion expected by
F. M. Fern´andez is valid in all orders.

Justiﬁcation of equations (2) and (3). To solve

equation (2), let

ρr(U (t)) = u0(t) + λu1(t) + · · · =

λnun(t)

(5)

X

be the formal perturbative expansion of ρr(U (t)) in pow-
ers of λ. Plugging (5) into (2), we have u0(t) = I and a
sequence of initial value problems

d(λun)
dt

λun(0) = 0

= un−1τ (λA)

(6)

(cid:16)

U †(t) ˆOU (t)
(cid:17)

d
dt ρr(U (t))
(cid:1)

Solving (6) inductively, the unique solution in equation
(3) is then obtained. Next, we note that, to arrive
at equation (2) we just need to verify from the deﬁni-
( ˆO) ≡
tions that 1) ρr(U (0))( ˆO) = O, 2)
d
(cid:0)
= (ρr(U (t))τ (λA(t))) ( ˆO). The actual
dt
veriﬁcation is just a simple computation based on deﬁ-
nitions and equation (1) and is omitted here due to the
restriction of the length of this comment. (For those peo-
ple who know representation theory, the quickest way to
obtain equation (2) is to apply the right adjoint represen-
tation to equation (1). In fact, the quickest way to obtain
equation (4) is to apply the right adjoint representation
to the formal perturbative expansion formula for solution
of equation (1) — a formula in many standard textbook
of quantum mechanics.)

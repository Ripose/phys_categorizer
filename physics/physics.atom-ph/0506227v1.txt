Within a systematic approach based on the dimensionally regularized nonrelativistic quantum electrodynam-
4 for the g factor of an
ics, we derive the complete result for the two-loop correction to order (α/π)
electron bound in an nS state of a hydrogenlike ion. The results obtained signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of
the theoretical predictions for the hydrogenlike carbon and oxygen ions and inﬂuence the value of the electron
mass inferred from g factor measurements.

INTRODUCTION

The g factor of a bound electron is the coupling constant
of the spin to an external, homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld. In
natural units ~ = c = ε0 = 1, it is deﬁned by the relation

δE = −

e
2 m

g
2

,

~σ · ~B
D

E

(1)

where δE is the energy shift of the electron due to the interac-
tion with the magnetic ﬁeld ~B, m is the mass of the electron,
and e is the physical electron charge (e < 0). The matrix ~σ · ~B
contains the Pauli spin matrices ~σ and has eigenvalues ±| ~B|.
Studies of the free-electron g factor play an important role
in modern physics. Together with the discovery of the Lamb
shift in hydrogen, the observation of the electron magnetic
moment anomaly led to the development of quantum electro-
dynamics (QED). After decades of intensive theoretical and
experimental studies, the free-electron g factor provides one
of the most accurate and stringent tests of QED [1]. With the
increased experimental and theoretical precision, it presently
yields the most accurate determination of the ﬁne-structure
constant α [2].

It has not been until recently that investigations of the
bound-electron g factor came into prominence. As was
demonstrated in Ref. [3], the theoretical value of the bound-
electron g factor can be used for the determination of the mass
of the electron when combined with an experimental value for
the ratio of the electronic Larmor precession frequency ωL and
the cyclotron frequency of the ion in the trap ωc,

m = mion

where q is the charge of the ion and mion is its mass. The ac-
curacy of the best experimental results for light hydrogenlike
ions [4, 5] is already below the 1 part per billion level and is
likely to be improved in the future. According to the recent
adjustment of fundamental constants [2], these measurements
provide the most accurate method for the determination of the
electron mass.

In order to match the experimental precision achieved, vari-
ous binding and QED corrections to the bound-electron g fac-
tor have to be calculated. It has been found long ago [6] that
in a relativistic (Dirac) theory, the g factor of a bound elec-
tron differs from the value g = 2 due to the so-called binding
corrections. For an nS state, they are given by

g(0) =

where E is the Dirac energy. Other corrections to the bound-
electron g factor arise from the QED theory. They were the
subject of extensive theoretical investigations during the last
decade. Accurate calculations of the one-loop self-energy
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11], vacuum-polarization [8, 9, 12, 13], nuclear-
recoil [14, 15, 16], and nuclear-polarizability [17] corrections
have been carried out. Detailed g factor investigations have
been performed also for other systems that could be of experi-
mental interest in the near future, in particular, for Li-like ions
[18] and hydrogenlike ions with a non-zero nuclear spin [19].

The subject of this work is the two-loop QED correction,
which is presently the main source of the uncertainty of the-
oretical predictions for the g factor of hydrogenlike ions. We
present a complete calculation of this correction up to the or-
der of (α/π)2 (Z α)4. This two-loop correction has already
been addressed to in our former work [20], where an incom-
plete calculation using a photon-mass regularization was pre-
sented and an estimate for the total contribution up to the or-
der (α/π)2 (Z α)4 was obtained. The present computational
method is based on the dimensionally-regularized nonrela-
tivistic quantum electrodynamics (NRQED), which is a rel-
atively new and very powerful approach for the calculation of
higher-order relativistic and radiative effects. It has already
been successfully applied to several challenging problems,
e.g., to the calculation of the positronium hyperﬁne split-
ting [21] and the ground-state energy of the helium atom [22].

II. DIMENSIONALLY REGULARIZED NRQED

form factors F1 and F2 (see, e.g., Ch. 7 of [23])

The nonrelativistic Hamiltonian of the hydrogenic system is

and takes the form

Ωd =

2 πd/2

.

H0 =

Zε α

As is customary in dimensionally regularized QED, we here
assume that the dimension of the space-time is D = 4 − 2 ε,
and that of the space d = 3 − 2 ε. The parameter ε is consid-
ered as small, but only on the level of matrix elements, where
an analytic continuation to a noninteger spatial dimension is
allowed.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the extension of the basic formulas
of NRQED to the case of an arbitrary number of dimensions.
The momentum-space representation of the photon propaga-
tor preserves its form, namely gµν/k2. The Coulomb interac-
tion is [21]

where the latter representation provides an implicit deﬁnition
of Zε, and we have used the formula for the surface area of a
d-dimensional unit sphere

The operator ~p 2 is well deﬁned in any integer dimension.
If we restrict our consideration to the spherically symmetric
states, ~p 2 can be continued to an arbitrary real dimension by

~p 2 = −

rd−1

.

In the following, we will not need the explicit (unknown) form
of the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation in d dimensions.
It will be sufﬁcient to use instead its scaling properties, which
we obtain by introducing the dimensionless radial variable ρ

ρ = (m α)

1+2 ε r .

In atomic units, i.e. expressed as a function of the dimension-
less ρ, the Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian takes the form

H0 = α

We now turn to relativistic corrections to the Schr¨odinger
Hamiltonian in an arbitrary number of dimensions. These cor-
rections can be obtained from the Dirac Hamiltonian by the
Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. In order to incorporate a
part of radiative effects right from the beginning, we use an
effective Dirac Hamiltonian modiﬁed by the electromagnetic

where by dots we denote the omitted higher-order terms,

tonian H ′ is a generalization of the Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamil-
tonian HF W [24] to an arbitrary number of dimensions. The
electromagnetic ﬁeld in H ′ is the sum of the external Coulomb
ﬁeld, the external (constant) magnetic ﬁeld, and a slowly vary-
ing ﬁeld of the radiation. For practical calculations, it is more
convenient to have a Hamiltonian expressed in terms of the
gauge-independent ﬁeld strengths. To achieve this, we sep-
arate out the Coulomb ﬁeld and perform the Power-Zienau
transformation of the Hamiltonian H ′ with the operator S′ of
the form [24]

Here, Lij = ri pj − rj pi and B,k ≡ ∇kB. H ′′ is the gen-
eralization of the Power-Zienau Hamiltonian HP Z [24] to an
arbitrary number of dimensions.

The Hamiltonian H ′′ includes most of the radiative cor-
rections that are needed for our calculation, but not all of
them. First, the higher-order terms with the anomalous mag-
netic moment are omitted in H ′′. This contribution is more
conveniently calculated with the exact Dirac-Coulomb wave
functions, starting directly from the Hamiltonian (10). Fur-
thermore, there is an additional correction that cannot be ac-
counted for by the F1 and F2 form factors. It is represented
by an effective local operator that is quadratic in the ﬁeld
strengths. This operator is derived separately by evaluating
a low-energy limit of the electron scattering amplitude off the
Coulomb and the magnetic ﬁelds. Details of this calculation
are presented in Appendix B. The result is

III. ONE-LOOP SELF-ENERGY CORRECTION

The dimensionally regularized NRQED approach formu-
lated in the previous section will be ﬁrst employed for a
derivation of the self-energy correction to order (α/π) (Z α)4
for the bound-electron g factor. This derivation will serve us
as a test of the new approach (as this result has been already
obtained in our previous work [20]) and also as a basis for the
two-loop calculation.

As in [20], we separate the one-loop self-energy correction

up to the order of (α/π) (Z α)4 into three parts,

g(1) = g(1)

1 + g(1)

2 + g(1)

3

,

(18)

where the ﬁrst part is the the contribution due to the free-
electron form factors F1 and F2, the second part is the con-
tribution induced by the additional Hamiltonian (17), and the
third part is the contribution coming from low-energy photons,
i.e. a Bethe-logarithm type contribution.

We start with the form-factor part g(1)

1 . The anoma-
lous magnetic moment F2(0) in the modiﬁed Dirac-Coulomb

Hamiltonian (10) leads to the following energy shift linear in
the magnetic ﬁeld (d = 3)

In obtaining this result, we used the closed-form expression
[25, 26] for the component of the Dirac wave function per-
turbed by the magnetic interaction, which has the same rela-
tivistic angular momentum, as the reference state.

For the remaining part of the form-factor contribution, we
employ the transformed Hamiltonian (16). The last term of
this Hamiltonian

The third part of Eq. (18) is a low-energy contribution that
can be considered as a correction to the Bethe logarithm due
to the interaction with an external magnetic ﬁeld. Let us ﬁrst
derive the Bethe-logarithm correction to the hydrogen Lamb
shift within the dimensional regularization. The correction to
the energy is

IV. TWO-LOOP CONTRIBUTION

The derivation of the two-loop corrections to the bound-
electron g factor is performed in full analogy to the one-
loop calculations. The total two-loop correction of the order
(α/π)2 (Z α)4 can be separated into four parts,

g(2) = g(2)

1 + g(2)

2 + g(2)

3 + g(2)

4

.

(52)

1

The ﬁrst part g(2)
is a form-factor contribution. The sec-
ond part g(2)
is an additional high-energy contribution not ac-
counted for by the form factors. The third part arises from a
contribution in which one of the two virtual photons is of low
energy. The second photon effectively modiﬁes the vertex,
which can be accounted for by the anomalous magnetic mo-
ment. The fourth contribution g(2)
involves the closed fermion
loops and is called the vacuum polarization part.

(51)

We start with the form-factor contribution. The two-loop
anomalous magnetic moment correction is obtained from the

corresponding one-loop contribution, Eq. (20)

The second-order corrections involving the slope of the one-
loop form factors and the one-loop anomalous magnetic mo-
ment vanish. It becomes clear if we notice that the coupling
of the anomalous magnetic moment to the magnetic ﬁeld, as
obtained from the Hamiltonian (16), is

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In Table I, we collect all contributions available for the 1S
bound-electron g factor in three speciﬁc hydrogenlike ions

which are important from an experimental point of view. For
two of them, carbon and oxygen, accurate experimental re-
sults are presently available [4, 5], whereas the experiment on
calcium is planned for the future [27].

The errors of the point-nucleus Dirac value and of the free
part of the one-loop QED correction indicated in the table
originate from the uncertainty of the ﬁne-structure constant,
α−1 = 137.035 999 11(46) [2]. The ﬁnite-nuclear-size cor-
rection was re-evaluated in this work using the most recent
values for the root-mean-square (rms) nuclear radii [28]. The
error ascribed to this correction originates both from the un-
certainty of the rms radius and from the estimated model de-
pendence for the nuclear-charge distribution.

The one-loop QED correction up to the order of (Z α)4 is
given by the sum of the self-energy part [Eq. (51)] and the
vacuum-polarization part [29],

The higher-order one-loop self-energy correction was inferred
from the results of the all-order numerical calculation [10, 11].
For carbon and oxygen, the results presented in the table were
obtained in Ref. [20] by an extrapolation of the numerical re-
sults [10] for Z > 8, after subtracting the known terms of
the Zα expansion. The one-loop vacuum-polarization correc-
tion consists of two parts, the electric-loop contribution that
is due to the vacuum-polarization insertion into the electron
line and the magnetic-loop contribution, which corresponds
to the insertion of the vacuum-polarization loop into the in-
teraction with the external magnetic ﬁeld. The values for the
higher-order electric-loop contribution presented in the table
were inferred from the all-order numerical results of Ref. [30],

whereas the magnetic-loop contribution was taken from the
recent evaluation [13].

The (Z α)0 and (Z α)2 parts of the two- and more-loop
QED correction comprise the two-, three-, and four-loop con-
tributions to the free-electron g factor, multiplied by a kine-
matic factor of the electron [31]. The (Z α)4 part of the two-
loop QED contribution was derived in the present work. The
uncertainty due to higher-order two-loop contributions was es-
timated as

h.o. = 2 g(1)
g(2)

g(2)[(Z α)2]
g(1)[(Z α)2]

,

(74)

where g(n)
g(n)[(Z α)2] is the n-loop (Z α)2 QED contribution.

h.o. is the n-loop higher-order QED contribution and

The nuclear recoil correction to ﬁrst order in the mass ratio
m/M but to all order in Z α was calculated in Refs. [14, 16].
The leading recoil corrections to order (m/M )2 and α m/M
were derived in Refs. [32, 33] for a nuclear spin I = 1/2 and
recently generalized for an arbitrary nuclear spin in Ref. [15].
Based on the data presented in Table I, we conclude that our
evaluation of the one- and two-loop QED corrections to order
(Z α)4 improves the accuracy of the theoretical prediction for
carbon by an order of magnitude, as compared to the previous
compilation [10]. The resulting QED contribution to order
(Z α)4 turns out to be rather small for carbon and oxygen,
as a result of a cancellation between the logarithmic and the
nonlogarithmic parts of this correction [see Eq. (71)]. For cal-
cium, to the contrary, the numerical contribution of the two-
loop (Z α)4 correction is large and of the same order as the
(Z α)2 correction. This indicates that the perturbative Z α-
expansion approach is no longer effective in this region of Z,
and a direct all-order numerical evaluation would be highly
desirable.

It is remarkable that among different sources of the theoret-
ical uncertainty for calcium, the error due to the higher-order
two-loop QED correction is by far the dominant one. This
means that, if the prospective experimental investigation of

the bound-electron g factor in calcium is performed on the
same level of accuracy as for carbon, namely 10−9, a com-
parison of the theoretical and experimental results would al-
low one to identify the contribution of the non-perturbative (in
Z α) two-loop QED effects with a 10% accuracy.

The comparison of the theoretical and experimental results
for the 1S bound-electron g factor in carbon and oxygen
yields the presently most accurate method for determination
of the electron mass [2]. Based on the theoretical g factor val-
ues presented in Table I, we obtain the following values for
the electron mass derived from the experiments on carbon [4]
and oxygen [5] (in atomic mass units):

m(12C5+) = 0.000 548 579 909 32 (29) ,
m(16O7+) = 0.000 548 579 909 60 (41) .

(75)
(76)

The uncertainty of these results originates from the experi-
mental value for the ratio of the electronic Larmor precession
frequency and the cyclotron frequency of the ion in the trap;
the uncertainty due to the theoretical prediction is more than
by an order of magnitude smaller and thus negligible.

The subscript VP denotes the contribution to the two-loop
form factors which involves a closed fermion loop.

Hamiltonian (16) and leads to a simple polynomial expression
for the resulting amplitude.

APPENDIX B: THE LOW-ENERGY LIMIT OF THE
SCATTERING AMPLITUDE

In this section we describe the evaluation of the low-energy
limit of the spin-dependent part of the scattering amplitude
that gives rise to the effective Hamiltonian (17). The scatter-
ing amplitude under consideration is schematically depicted
in Fig. 1, where the leftmost graph is the “tree” diagram and
the remaining graphs represent the tree diagram “dressed” by
a self-energy photon. The two-loop diagrams are not shown
explicitly; they can be obtained from the one-photon ones in
a standard way. Each graph contains two interactions with
the external ﬁeld, one of which is the interaction with the ho-
mogeneous magnetic ﬁeld (a γi vertex) and the other is the
interaction with the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus (a γ0 ver-
tex). From the one- and two-loop scattering amplitudes we
additionally subtract a tree amplitude with the vertices modi-
ﬁed by the electromagnetic form factors F1 and F2. This pro-

FIG. 1: Feynman diagrams representing the scattering amplitude of
a free electron on both the Coulomb and the magnetic ﬁeld, at the
tree and the one-loop level.

In order to extract the spin dependent part of the scattering
amplitude, we construct the projection operator. Let us ﬁrst
consider a general non-relativistic operator Q,

Q = Q0 + Qi σi .

(B1)

The spin-dependent part of Q can be retrieved by the follow-
ing projection operator:

Qi =

Tr[Q σi] .

(B2)

In d dimensions, the nonrelativistic expansion of the Hamil-
tonian involves σij = [σi , σj ]/(2 i). The extension of the
spin-projection operator to an arbitrary number of dimensions
is

Qij =

Tr[Q σij ] ,

(B3)

with Q = Qij σij . We assume here the following properties
of the trace to hold:

Tr[σij ] = 0 ,
Tr[I] = 2 ,

Tr[σij σkl] = 2 (δik δjl − δjk δil) .

(B4)

We now consider the operator Q sandwiched between the
positive-energy solutions of the free Dirac equation normal-
ized by ¯u u = 1. The following identity holds,

¯u(pf , sf ) Q u(pi, si) = Tr[Q u(pi, si) ¯u(pf , sf )] .

(B5)

Since our aim is to calculate the low-energy limit of the am-
plitude only, we can use an approximate form for u(p, s),

u(p, s) ≈

where φ is a nonrelativistic spinor. Using a replacement that
extracts the spin dependence

the projection operator becomes (in units m = 1)

We now turn to the scattering amplitude of the free electron
on the Coulomb and magnetic ﬁelds. The spin-dependent part
of this amplitude is written as

(cid:2)

Q = Qµνρ e A0(q1) e Aµ(q2) σνρ ,
where q1 and q2 denote the exchange momenta. The ampli-
tude corresponding to the tree diagram in Fig. 1 is given by

The other one- and two-loop contributions are obtained in the

momenta ~pi , ~pf and the subsequent integration over the loop
momenta. The result for Qµνρ can be written in the form

Qµνρ =

where the functions F µνρ and Gµνρ are orthogonal to qµ

Abstract

Virial relations for the Dirac equation in a central ﬁeld and their applications to
calculations of H-like atoms are considered.
It is demonstrated that using these re-
lations allows one to evaluate various average values for a hydrogenlike atom. The
corresponding relations for non-diagonal matrix elements provide an eﬀective method
for analytical evaluations of inﬁnite sums that occur in calculations based on using
the reduced Coulomb-Green function. In particular, this method can be used for cal-
culations of higher-order corrections to the hyperﬁne splitting and to the g factor in
hydrogenlike atoms.

Introduction

In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the virial theorem for a particle moving in a central
ﬁeld V (r) is given by the well known equation:

where
can easily be derived from the equation [1]

T
h

i

denotes the average value of the kinetic energy in a stationary state. This theorem

if we take A = (r
p). Equation (2), which is generally called as the hypervirial theorem, can
also be employed to derive virial relations for diagonal matrix elements of other operators [2].
An extention of these relations to the case of non-diagonal matrix elements was considered
in [3, 4].

·

For the Dirac equation in a central ﬁeld, the virial theorem was ﬁrst derived by Fock [5].

If we denote the bound-state energy by E, it gives

Some additional virial relations for the Dirac equation were obtained by a number of authors
(see, e.g., [2, 6] and references therein). Virial relations, which yield recurrence formulas for
various average values, were obtained in [2, 7, 8, 9]. In the case of the Coulomb ﬁeld, these
, and
relations can be employed to derive explicit formulas for the average values

The corresponding recurrence relations for non-diagonal matrix elements were derived in [9].
In the case of the Coulomb ﬁeld, it was found that these relations can be employed to derive
explicit formulas for the ﬁrst-order corrections to the Dirac wave function due to interaction
n)β. Later on
with perturbative potentials of the form
(see references below), this method was used for calculations of various corrections to the
energy levels, to the hyperﬁne structure splitting, and to the bound-electron g factor. In
constract to direct analytical and numerical calculations, the virial relation method allows
one to derive formulas for various physical quantities by simple algebraic transformations.
In the present paper, following mainly to [9], we derive the virial relations for the Dirac
equation and examine their applications to calculations of H-like atoms. Relativistic units
(¯h = c = 1) are used in the paper.

It should be noted here that the integral A−3 exists only for
2. The integral C1
occurs in calculations of the bound-electron g factor. The integrals C−2 and A−3 occur in
calculations of the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole hyperﬁne splitting, respectively,
(see [11] for details). Formulas (27)-(29) and (36)-(41) were also employed in calculations of
the recoil corrections to the atomic energy levels [12, 13].

5 Calculations of the bound-electron g factor and the

p

hyperﬁne splitting in H-like atoms

For the last few years a signiﬁcant progress was achieved in calculations of the bound-electron
g factor and the hyperﬁne splitting in H-like atoms. Formulas (55) and (60) were extensively
employed in these calculations.

In [15], a complete αZ-dependence formula for the recoil correction of order m/M to the
g factor of an H-like atom was derived. According to this formula, which was conﬁrmed by
an independent derivation in [16], the recoil correction is given by (e < 0)

indicates that the related quantity (the wave function, the energy, and the Coulomb-Green

homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld H directed along the z axis. In equation (67) and below, the
summation over the repeated indices (k = 1, 2, 3), which enumerate components of the three-
dimensional vectors, is implicit. For the practical calculations, this expression is conveniently
represented by the sum of the lower-order term and the higher-order term, ∆g = ∆gL +∆gH,

In [23, 24], formulas (55) and (60) were employed to evaluate analytically the one-loop
vacuum-polarization (VP) corrections to the bound-electron g factor and to the hyperﬁne

formula (55) was used to evaluate the nuclear-polarization eﬀect on the bound-electron g
factor.

6 Other applications of the virial relations

Applications of the virial relations are not restricted only by H-like atoms and by the pure
Coulomb ﬁeld. In [14], formulas (58) and (60) were employed to calculate the interelectronic-
interaction corrections to the hyperﬁne splitting in Li-like ions.
In [29], virial relations
(16)-(19) with V (r)
αZ/r were used to evaluate the recoil correction to the Lamb shift
for an extended nucleus. As an example, let us demonstrate how the virial relations with
αZ/r can be employed to evaluate the nuclear-size correction of the lowest order

Formula (111) coincides with the related expression derived in [11] for the sphere model for
the nuclear charge distribution, while the relativistic n-independent term in formula (110)
diﬀers from the corresponding term that can be derived from the formulas presented in
[11]. Since, for the sphere model, the approach developed in [11] provides a more accu-
rate evaluation of the nuclear size correction than the perturbation theory considered here,
formula (110) can be improved by replacing the relativistic n-independent term with the

Formulas (110) and (112) diﬀer only by the last constant term.

The virial relations are also helpful for calculations employing ﬁnite basis set methods or
analytical expressions for the Coulomb-Green function. In particular, they were employed
in [30, 31] to calculate the nuclear recoil corrections by using the B-spline method for the
Dirac equation [32]. In that paper, using the virial relations, the original formulas for the
recoil corrections, which contain some integrands with a singular behaviour at r
0, were
expressed in terms of less singular integrals. As a result, the convergence of the numerical
procedure for small r was signiﬁcantly improved. In [8], the virial relations for diagonal
matrix elements were used to construct Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger expansions for eigenvalues of
perturbed radial Dirac equations to arbitrary order.

7 Conclusion

In this paper we have considered the derivation of the virial relations for the Dirac equation
and their applications for calculations of various physical quantities. It has been demon-
strated that the virial relations are a very eﬀective tool for analytical and high-precision
numerical calculations of the hyperﬁne splitting and the bound-electron g factor in H-like
ions. They are also useful for calculations employing ﬁnite basis set methods and analytical
expressions for the Coulomb-Green function.

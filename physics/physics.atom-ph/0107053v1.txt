We simulate collisions between two atoms, which move in an optical lattice under the dipole-
dipole interaction. The model describes simultaneously the two basic dynamical processes, namely
the Sisyphus cooling of single atoms, and the light-induced inelastic collisions between them. We
consider the J = 1/2 → J = 3/2 laser cooling transition for Cs, Rb and Na. We ﬁnd that the hotter
atoms in a thermal sample are selectively lost or heated by the collisions, which modiﬁes the steady
state distribution of atomic velocities, reminiscent of the evaporative cooling process.

I. INTRODUCTION

Laser cooling and trapping techniques have made it
possible to study and manipulate samples of cold neutral
atoms [1]. It has lead to the precision control of atomic
matter, and also opened new possibilities for investiga-
tions of interaction dynamics between atoms, especially
those mediated by light [2]. By controlling the inter-
nal states of the atoms we obtain access to their center-
of-mass motion [1,3]. Sisyphus cooling and polarization
gradient cooling methods [4], which allow one to break
the Doppler limit for low temperatures, are based on the
way polarized light connects to the atomic states. By
combining more than one laser beam we can introduce a
spatially changing polarization state into the total light
ﬁeld interacting with atoms. As light introduces Stark
shifts on atomic states, the spatially changing polariza-
tion appears as a spatially changing potential for atoms
with a suitable angular momentum state structure. In
addition to the cooling eﬀect, this has made it possible
to build periodic or quasiperiodic lattices [5], where the
light ﬁeld traps the atoms. We describe the Sisyphus
cooling and lattice structure in Sec. II.

The basic laser cooling method is Doppler cooling [1],
which is produced by the random scattering of photons
absorbed from the laser beam. This cooling mechanism
is not related to the polarization states of light. For
alkali atoms this method has a limiting temperature,
the Doppler temperature TD = ¯hΓ/2kB, where Γ is the
atomic linewidth. Using the polarization states, i.e., Sisy-
phus cooling and polarization gradient cooling, one can
go below TD until the photon recoil limit, TR, is reached,
and creating a lattice as a byproduct. The values of TR
and TD for used elements are given in Table I. Typically
one reaches a thermal equilibrium where the atoms are
more or less localized at lattice sites, but can also move
between them. The eﬃciency and the degree of localiza-
tion have been studied thoroughly in the past [5]. Since
the best ﬁlling ratios (number of atoms per site) with
small-detuning lattices are on the order of 10 % [5], one
can consider the gas sample as noninteracting. Larger

1

ﬁlling ratios have been achieved lately by special tech-
niques in far-detuned optical lattices [6]. Based on the
experience in standard magneto–optical traps (MOTs),
the increasing density for small-detuning lattices is ex-
pected to lead to strong loss and heating of atoms due
to collisions, which become strongly inelastic in the pres-
ence of the near-resonant cooling light [2,7]. By a “small-
detuning lattice” we mean one that is detuned a few
atomic linewidths below the transition frequency.

The light-assisted collisions are based on the fact that
the two slowly approaching atoms form a quasimolecule,
which the light can excite resonantly during the ap-
proach, even though the cooling beams are clearly oﬀ
the resonance with the atomic transition energy which
corresponds only asymptotically to the molecular state
transition energy. The resonance occurs at relatively
long distances [8], where the dominant contribution to
the molecular behavior, i.e., the interaction potential be-
tween atoms, comes from the dipole-dipole interaction
(DDI). We describe these collisions in Sec. III, and de-
rive an expression for DDI in Sec. IV. We have presented
the ﬁrst results of our work in a previous short publica-
tion [9], where details of the derivation were omitted, so
here we present them in full. It should be noted that one
can develop e.g. a mean ﬁeld approach to atom-atom pro-
cesses via the DDI [10–13]. In our approach, albeit with
some limitations, we allow the atoms to move. Further-
more, we consider the problem in the atom-atom basis,
with the full Zeeman substate structure, in the presence
of the cooling/lattice-building laser beams with spatially
changing polarization structure. Thus our model treats
the Sisyphus cooling and localization of the atoms, and
the atomic collisions dynamics consistently, within the
same framework.

In order to describe two multistate atoms moving
quantum mechanically as wave packets in position and
momentum space, and being coupled both to the spa-
tially changing laser ﬁeld as well as the vacuum ﬁeld
producing spontaneous emission, we would in principle
have to use the density matrix description. This is not
computationally possible currently, but we can go around

the problem by describing the spontaneous emission with
quantum jumps. As described in Sec. V, we use the
Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method to build a
statistical ensemble of time evolution histories, which ap-
proximates adequately the actual density matrix [14–16].
To implement this approach on our description of atomic
collisions in lattices is not straightforward, and in Sec. VI
we describe the details related to numerical simulations.
Inelastic collisions in MOTs have been modelled exten-
sively with semiclassical models [17]. We describe these
models brieﬂy in Sec. VII. They provide a tool for under-
standing some of the physics behind the numerical data,
and for estimating the processes aﬀecting the multitude
of boundaries for the numerical methods.

Our Monte Carlo simulation results, presented in
Sec. VIII, indicate that the hotter atoms in our ther-
mal sample, due to their stronger mobility between the
lattice sites, are more likely to collide inelastically than
the colder ones. On the other hand, the simulations, sup-
ported by semiclassical estimates, show that inelasticity
plays a relevant role only if the atoms end up in the same
lattice site simultaneously. In other words, the eﬀect of
the dipole-dipole interaction remains small if the atoms
do not share the same lattice site. This, of course, also
depends on the chosen laser ﬁeld parameters such as in-
tensity and detuning. When the close, same-site encouter
occurs, however, it is most likely a strongly inelastic one
leading to the loss of atoms. Basically, we see a process
similar to evaporative cooling, where the hotter atoms are
selectively heated or ejected from the lattice. It should be
noted, though, that despite the fully quantum mechanical
nature of our approach, it still omits many other eﬀects
aﬀecting the atomic cloud in the lattice. Photons scat-
tered incoherently by atoms can be reabsorbed, which
produces a radiation pressure; this process also heats the
atomic cloud as its density and thus optical thickness
increases [1].

The observations made in this paper follow those from
our previous study [9]. The results given in this paper,
however, have been obtained with an improved approach
compared to Ref. [9], and we have also extended our stud-
ies to all the basic alkali species. Furthermore, here we
give the detailed description of our approach and its com-
putational aspects. Finally, the discussion in Sec. IX con-
cludes our presentation.

II. SISYPHUS COOLING AND OPTICAL
LATTICES

In this Section we present the atom–laser system under
study and describe brieﬂy the basics of Sisyphus laser
cooling of neutral atoms in an optical lattice. Detailed
review of the subject can be found in Refs. [1,4,5].

FIG. 1. The level structure of a single atom. We show the
squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients of corresponding
transitions describing the strengths of couplings between the
Zeeman sublevels. The diﬀerence between the laser frequency
ωL and the atomic frequency ω0, i.e., the laser detuning, is δ.

A. Atom–laser system

We consider here atoms having ground state angular
momentum Jg = 1/2 and excited state angular momen-
tum Je = 3/2 corresponding to alkali metal elements
when the hyperﬁne structure is neglected. The resonance
Eg
frequency between the states is ω0 so that ¯hω0 = Ee −
where Ee and Eg are energies of the ground and the ex-
cited states in zero ﬁeld. A single atom has two ground
state sublevels
g±1/2 > and four excited state sublevels
|
e±1/2 > where the half–integer subscripts
e±3/2 > and
|
|
indicate the quantum number m of the angular momen-
tum along the z direction, see Fig. 1. The values of
atomic masses that are used in our simulations are those
of cesium (133Cs), rubidium (85Rb) and sodium (23Na)
which are the conventional alkali metal elements used for
laser cooling of neutral atoms, see Table I.

The laser ﬁeld consists of two counter–propagating
beams with orthogonal linear polarizations and with fre-
quency ωL. The total ﬁeld has a polarization gradient in
one dimension and reads

E(z, t) =

0(exeikr z

(1)

where
0 is the amplitude and kr the wavenumber. With
this ﬁeld, the polarization changes from circular σ− to
linear and back to circular in the opposite direction σ+
when z changes by λL/4 where λL is the wavelength of
the lasers.

The periodic polarization gradient of the laser ﬁeld is
reﬂected in the periodic light shifts, AC–Stark shifts, of
the atomic sublevels creating the optical lattice structure.
The relative strengths of the couplings between a single
ground state sublevel and various excited state sublevels
vary spatially according to the polarization of the light
ﬁeld due to unequal values of the Clebsch–Gordan coef-
ﬁcients for diﬀerent transitions. This induces light shifts
and produces a periodic optical potential structure such
that the shape of the light-induced potentials is the same
for the two ground state sublevels but the potentials are
shifted spatially with respect to each other by λL/4, see

ated due to the periodic polarization gradient of the laser

B. Sisyphus cooling

When the atomic motion occurs in a suitable velocity
range, optical pumping of the atom between ground state
sublevels reduces the kinetic energy of the atom [4]. This
occurs because within the suitable velocity range, quan-
tum jumps and optical pumping to another ground state
sublevel tend to occur when the atom is near the top of
the optical potential and is transferred to the bottom of
the other one due to a quantum jump. Thus the sub-
sequently emitted photon has a larger energy than the
absorbed one and the kinetic energy of the atom is there-
fore reduced, and the atom is cooled. After several such
cooling cycles the atom localizes into the optical poten-
tial well, i.e., into an optical lattice site. Figure 3 shows
the optical pumping cycles between the ground state sub-
levels cooling an atom, and the oscillations of the atomic
wave packet after localization into an optical lattice site.
The intensity of the laser ﬁeld and the strength of the
coupling between the ﬁeld and the atom is described by

a single atom wave packet for two ground state Zeeman levels,

pumping cycles and the localization of a single atom into the
optical lattice. This example forms one member of a Monte
Carlo simulation, and the discontinuous changes between the
two ground states are due to quantum jump events from the
excited state (not shown), selected to happen randomly with
an appropriately weighted probability. If the run is repeated,
the jumps would appear at diﬀerent times again.

The laser parameters Ω and δ determine if the lattice is
in the “jumping” or in the “oscillating” regime, depend-
ing on the average number of atomic oscillations in a
single lattice site before the atom is optically pumped to
neighboring sites [18]. It must be noted that tight local-
ization and occupation of the lowest vibrational levels of
a periodic lattice potential increases the optical pumping
time τp and the time of localization within a single lattice
site becomes longer compared to the semiclassical values
presented in Table II.

We are interested in the eﬀect of inelastic collisions be-
tween atoms in the presence of near–resonant light [2] in
optical lattices. These collisions occur when two atoms
occupy the same lattice site. To observe eﬃciently the ef-
fect of inelastic collisions we have chosen Ω and δ in most
of the simulations so that the lattice is in the “jumping”
regime, i.e., semiclassically speaking the atoms on aver-
age do not have time for a single full oscillation before
optical pumping transfers them to a neighboring lattice
site.

Steady state properties of the atomic cloud in the lat-
tice are characterized e.g. by the average kinetic energy
per atom, the spatial probability distribution or the mo-
mentum probability distribution. These are results which
we obtain from our simulations. We keep the detuning

Collisions and radiative heating increase the relative
velocity between the atoms [2]. This heats up the atoms
and it is possible for a colliding pair to escape from the
lattice. One can calculate semiclassically the critical mo-
mentum psc
c giving the point in momentum (p) space
where the cooling force has its maximum value [4]. In
Section VI F below, we discuss for which values of the
momentum pc we may neglect energetic histories and con-
sider the corresponding atoms lost from the lattice.

III. BINARY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COLD
ATOMS

In this Section we give a simple description of collisions
between two cold atoms in the presence of near resonant
light [2] and discuss the background of this phenomenon
to occur in an optical lattice.

molecule is excited at the Condon point rc and accelerated

process.

A. Binary interactions

×

In this study, we consider atomic gases with an occu-
pation density of ρo = 25 %, i.e., every fourth lattice
site is occupied and the average distance between two
atoms is za = λ. For Cs this corresponds to a density of
1012 atoms/cm3. This atomic gas density is low
1.62
enough that collisions can be treated as binary processes:
i) The collision range is an order of magnitude smaller
than za, and ii) for a Cs atomic mass, atoms with typical
maximum velocities produced in our simulations need to
have evolved over a time larger than 75 Γ−1 to travel a
distance za and they scatter a large enough number of
photons that there is negligible memory eﬀects between
two collision events. Thus, the binary collision picture is
justiﬁed in our calculations.

Let us consider two atoms with a temperature around
or below the Doppler temperature TD. If such two atoms
collide they form a quasimolecule which a near resonant
light may excite when the atoms approach each other.
This occurs at an internuclear distance called the Con-
don point (rc) where the excited state electronic molec-
ular potential becomes resonant with the ground state
potential as displayed in Fig. 4.

We neglect the hyperﬁne structure of the atoms and do
not consider the ground state hyperﬁne structure chang-
ing collisions, but concentrate on the eﬀects based on

this process, the resonant excitation of a quasimolecule
terminates in spontaneous decay and the colliding pair
of atoms gains kinetic energy due to acceleration on an
attractive molecular excited state before decay occurs,
see Fig. 4. In principle it is also possible to loose atoms
from the trap via ﬁne structure changing collisions [2].
In this work, the loss fraction of ﬁne structure changing

4

collisions is assumed to be negligible compared to the
radiative escape mechanism. The small detuning of the
lasers makes rc very large, and the probability for sur-
viving to the small internuclear distances required for the
ﬁne structure change is rather small. Furthermore, the
energy increase caused by this mechanism is large and
leads mainly to loss of atoms, contributing to heating
only via secondary collisions. These secondary collisions
are still rather rare in the low-density gas samples of laser
cooled atoms.

An essential ingredient in the kinetic energy increas-
ing collision process is the excitation of the large fraction
of the population into the attractive excited state. The
excited state population fraction in turn depends on the
relative velocity between the interacting atoms when they
reach rc for the attractive molecular states. For the colli-
sions in the lattice, the relative velocity in turn depends
on the optical lattice modulation depth. The deeper the
lattice, the higher the relative velocity of the atoms when
they end up in the same lattice site and collide. We con-
sider here lattices with modulation depths in the range
1621Er, where Er is the recoil energy,
339Er ≤
cf. Table III. Thus, the relative velocities before a colli-
sion remain low, which keeps the excitation probability
large. The small detuning keeps the excitation proba-
bility large also since the excited state slope decreases
with the detuning; this increases the interaction time for
moving atoms at the vicinity of the resonance point rc.

B. Collisions in lattices

in
Theoretical and experimental collision studies
MOTs show that the atomic cloud is heated by the radia-
tive mechanism described above. Atoms may also escape
from a MOT by this mechanism [2,7]. Thus these colli-
sions set a limit for atomic densities and temperatures of
the cloud in a MOT when the density is increased so that
binary interactions begin to have a clear eﬀect. Typical
densities achieved in MOTs are around 1011 atoms/cm3
and temperatures around or below the Doppler cooling
limit [2].

Similar eﬀects are expected in an optical lattice when
the occupation density of the lattice increases. What is
not directly expected is that there is a parameter region
where a possible cooling process in a dense lattice occurs
due to collisions. This is due to the fact that the collid-
ing pair of atoms carry more kinetic energy than localized
ones and during a collision they almost always gain suﬃ-
cient energy to escape from the lattice. Thus those atoms
that have not collided inelastically and remain in a lat-
tice, have less kinetic energy per atom. Moreover, they
can also thermalize via elastic ground-ground collisions.
In our study, we neglect the rescattering of photons and
consequently the total pattern of cooling and heating is
not studied. Here we only consider the eﬀects of colli-
sions. The complete problem is simply not computation-

ally tractable within our framework.

Atomic interactions in lattices are usually modelled as-
suming ﬁxed positions for both atoms and calculating
how the atomic energy levels are shifted by the interac-
tion [10–13]. These static models ignore the dynamical
nature of the collision processes described here. When
allowing the atoms to move the problem becomes compli-
cated and computationally extremely tedious. To make
numerically feasible calculations, we have ﬁxed one atom
and allow the other one to move freely, as described fur-
ther in Sec. VI B.

IV. ATOMIC BASIS FORMULATION AND
DIPOLE-DIPOLE INTERACTION

In this section we describe the two–atom product state
basis [19] and the dipole–dipole interaction (DDI) be-
tween two atoms in our one-dimensional (1D) study.

A. Atomic basis formulation

We do not use the adiabatic elimination of the excited
states, which is typically employed in order to simplify
the equations for atomic motion [20]. By keeping the
excited states in the calculation we are able to account
for the dynamical nature of atomic interactions and the
radiative heating/escape mechanism.

In general the product state basis vectors are:

where j1 and j2 denote the ground or excited state (in
our case g for the ground state 2S1/2, e for the 2P3/2
excited state) and m1, m2 denote the quantum number
for the component of j along the quantization axis z for
atom 1 and 2 respectively. The total number of states is

We have to ﬁx the position of one atom, as described
in Sec. VI B. If the position of atom 1 is ﬁxed, the binary
system wave function depends now only on the position

B. Resonant dipole–dipole interaction

In order to get the DDI potential, Vdip, in Eq. (7),
we have calculated the Master Equation for the atom
and laser ﬁeld in question, and identiﬁed the DDI. Our
approach follows the lines of Appendix A in Ref. [21].
As it is beyond the scope of this paper to go through
the derivation of the DDI potential in detail, we shall
refer to equation (Ax) in Ref. [21] as Eq. (LMAx). We
identify Vdip as the terms similar to ∆11 and ∆22 with

tem Hamiltonian H1 + H2 in a basis of center-of-mass

V. MONTE CARLO WAVE FUNCTION METHOD

In this section we describe brieﬂy the main features
of the Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method [14]
which was developed for problems in quantum optics and
discuss the implementation of the method to solve the
cold collision problem in optical lattices.

A. Basic Monte Carlo method

Various types of Monte Carlo (MC) methods [14–16]
have been developed for problems where a direct ana-
lytical or numerical quantum mechanical solution of the
density matrix Master Equation is very diﬃcult or im-
possible due to the complexity of the problem. Complex-
ity usually arises because of the coupling of the system

(19)

(20)

(21)

studied to a reservoir with a large number of degrees of
freedom and also because of a large number of elements
in the system density matrix. Problems of this kind are
common in laser cooling of neutral atoms. Various types
of quantum approaches are possible in 2D systems [23]
but in 3D a full quantum treatment of laser cooling of
atoms has only been given in terms of the Monte Carlo
method [24].

The core idea of MCWF method is the generation of a
large number of single wave function histories including
stochastic quantum jumps of the system studied. So-
lutions for the steady state density matrix and system
properties can then be calculated as ensemble averages
of single histories.

To generate single histories of the system wave function
, one solves the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation

H = HS + HDEC

(17)

where HS is the system Hamiltonian, Eq. (7) in our case,
and the non-Hermitian part HDEC includes the decay
part. HDEC is constructed from appropriate jump oper-
ators Cj corresponding to a decay channel j and to the
detection scheme of the system. The general form of the
non-Hermitian part reads

HDEC =

X
During a time evolution step δt the norm of the wave
function may shrink due to HDEC and the amount of
shrinking gives the probability of a quantum jump to oc-
cur during the short interval δt. Based on a random num-
ber one then decides whether a quantum jump occurred
or not. Before the next time step is taken, the wave
function of the system is renormalized. In the case that
a jump occurs, one performs a rearrangement of the wave
function components according to the jump operator Cj,
corresponding to decay channel j, before renormalization
of

B. Time evolution

A natural termination for a simulation occurs if a
steady state appears. One must note that the time to
reach steady state varies even for the same system stud-
ied when the laser parameters are changed. Therefore
one has to be careful to have long evolution times to
make sure that the steady state is reached and ensemble
averaging can be done in a reliable way.

We solve the time–dependent Schr¨odinger equa-
tion Eq. (19) by the split operator–Fourier transform
method [25]. Formally solving Eq. (19) over δt gives

where the time evolution operator U reads

U = exp

¯h

.

(cid:19)

−

(cid:18)

(22)

(23)

We split the time evolution operator U including the
Hamiltonian H of Eq. (20) into three parts as H = HV +
HK + HD. When H is in matrix form, HV has an oﬀ-
diagonal part accounting for the atom–ﬁeld coupling and
the interaction between atoms, HK is the diagonal kinetic
part and HD includes the non-kinetic diagonal part, i.e.,
decay and detuning.

For non-commuting operators A and B we can write

to second order accuracy [25]

exp (A + B)

exp (A/2) exp (B) exp(A/2).

implement and fast on a computer, e.g., 20% faster than

C. Decay channels

A single atom has six diﬀerent ways to spontaneously
emit a photon so the total number of decay channels is
12 for two atoms (channels 1
12 for
atom 2). For each decay channel, j, the jump probability
is given by

We neglect here the case where both atoms jump and
two photons are detected simultaneously. The proba-
bility for a single atom jump during δt is
1 so the
joint jump probability is negligible compared to the single
atom jump probability. In principle it would be possible
in simulations to take into account joint jumps but this
unnecessarily complicates the jump procedure. After ap-
plying the jump operator Cj , the wave function is still in
a superposition state, but it has collapsed onto product
state basis vectors, leaving only one ground state level
component of the jumped atom populated.

≪

D. Ensemble averaging

We calculate the results as an ensemble average of sin-
gle history time averages in the steady state time do-
main [16]. This averaging method requires a smaller
number of histories calculated to achieve reasonable er-
ror bars than a simple ensemble averaging at a single
steady state time point.
In our study, extra complica-
tions arise because the number of collision processes in
the whole ensemble also comes into play. Atoms do not
end up in the same lattice site, producing collisions, in
all the calculated histories. Atomic hopping between lat-
tice sites is a stochastic process and only in a fraction of
the total number of histories, collision processes occur.
We need a suﬃciently large ensemble to produce enough
collision events to have reliable results. This is why we
have a much larger ensemble size, 96
128 members, than
e.g. used in 3D laser cooling Monte Carlo simulations us-
ing the same ensemble averaging method [24].

−

In order to be able to use this averaging method, we
need to be sure that time averages of single histories have
been calculated in the steady state time domain. The
simulation times used are displayed in Table IV. We have
carefully checked from the time evolution of the kinetic
energy that the simulation time was long enough to reach
well into the steady state time domain.

VI. SIMULATION SCHEME

In this section we present the charasteristic units used
in our calculations and discuss the various criteria which
set the numerical limits for the simulations. The approx-
imations used and the numerical details related to the
wave packet initial conditions and dynamics are also pre-
sented.

A. Scaling and discretization of space

It is useful from a practical point of view to choose
suitable units and scale the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation (19) accordingly. Convenient physical units and
their numerical values for the three appropriate alkali
metal elements are listed in Table III. In the discussion
below, we list all quantities and scale equations in units of
the characteristic quantities displayed in Table III unless
explicitly stated otherwise.
As the phase factor exp(

iEδt/ǫ) has to be well de-
−
ﬁned, cf. Eq. (23), we obtain a criterion for the maximum
size of the time step δt dictated by the maximum kinetic
ǫ/p2. Here
energy since we should fulﬁll the relation δt
ǫ is the energy of the linewidth of the transition in re-
coil units, as previously displayed in Table I. Collisions
increase the atomic kinetic energies which makes the cri-
terion for δt numerically more strict for the two–atom
case, compared to the one–atom Sisyphus cooling simu-
lation (cf. Fig. 3). We give in Table IV the values of δt for
various simulations and the maximum momentum

the properties of the alkali metal elements and the laser
parameters.

For the numerical simulations, one has to discretize the
position and momentum spaces, and the resolution has
to be ﬁne enough to ensure valid results. We have used
8192 grid points when the length of the entire spatial grid
31.4λ. This gives the step sizes in position
is Lz = 5λ
and momentum spaces of δz
0.0038 and δp = 0.2.

The inverse space (here momentum space) has reﬂect-
ing boundary conditions when using the FFT method.
Thus the size of the momentum space has to be large
enough to avoid the reﬂection of high kinetic energy
atoms at the edges of the momentum space. This re-
quires special attention when considering the interaction
simulations where the kinetic energies of the atoms in-
crease due to the inelastic collisions.

The momentum space grid has a total size of Lk =
2π/δz = 1638 so that the atomic momenta may have
values
819. The depths of the lattices in our sim-
ulations are such that atoms localized at a lattice site
< 50. The momenta increase when
have momenta
the atoms wander around in the lattice, especially due to
the inelastic collisions. The probability of gaining a suf-
ﬁcient momentum to reach the edge of our momentum
space grid in a single collision event is now negligible.
On the other hand many consecutive collisions do not
shift the population for large p and the reﬂection eﬀect
is avoided. This is due to the fact that the increasing
relative velocity between the atoms reduce the excitation
probability and increases in momentum terminate before
the edges of the p–space are reached.

B. Position ﬁxing of one atom

We simulate the behaviour of a 36 level dissipative
quantum system with a position-dependent coupling to
the laser ﬁeld and a position-dependent coupling between
two atoms. This requires large computational resources.
With the current computer capacity, it is not possible to
simulate the situation where both atoms are allowed to
move freely. Instead we have to ﬁx one atom spatially and
let only the other atom move. This reduces the dimen-
sionality of the problem to one since the relative position
of the atoms with respect to the laser ﬁeld is now ﬁxed.
This also means that an inelastic interaction process will
not change the kinetic energy for both atoms, but we use
the relative kinetic energy as an estimate for the kinetic
energy change per atom.

In our previous study [9] the position of the ﬁxed atom
was kept constant but here we relax this condition. The
position zf of the ﬁxed atom is now selected randomly
< 0.125λ for each ensemble member.
in the interval

zf |
|

9

This range covers all the interesting physics as an atom
ﬁxed outside the current range would be rapidly opti-
cally pumped to the opposite lattice well and the situa-
tion would correspond to that with the above-mentioned
range of zf .

The change of zf also moves the Condon point rc with
respect to the lattice and now rc may be located any-
where between the lattice well and peak. This is an im-
portant point for making our model more realistic: Since
the kinetic energy of the atom changes when it moves
in the periodic optical potential, the relative velocity be-
tween the atoms and thus the excitation probability to
the attractive molecular state at rc depends on its posi-
tion in the lattice. When rc is located at the peak of the
optical potential, the atom has to move up the potential
hill to reach it. The relative velocity between the two
atoms is now less and the excitation probability higher
than in the case where the location of rc is at the bottom
of the optical potential.

C. Initial wave packet

At the beginning of the simulation, the wave packet is
placed in a randomly chosen ground state sublevel. The
initial Gaussian packet has a full spatial width of 0.02λ.
Thus the initial position of the spatially relatively narrow
wave packet in the lattice is random but completely out
of the range of the molecular resonance.

Each wave packet has a randomly selected mean ini-
tial velocity given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribu-
tion corresponding to the selected initial temperature of
the atomic cloud. We emphasize that the momentum
space width of the initial wave packet has no associa-
tion with the thermal distribution, as it is merely needed
to satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for a spa-
tially localized initial state. As stated above, the con-
nection between the wave packet and the temperature
takes place via the mean momentum of the wave packet.
By selecting this mean momentum randomly for each en-
semble member but weighting the occurrences with the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, we create within the
Monte Carlo ensemble another ensemble of possible ini-
tial collision velocities. This is the wave packet version
of the standard collisional energy average [26].

As mentioned above only the ensemble averaged mo-
mentum probability distribution has a relation to tem-
perature. This initial distribution gets narrower when
the system evolves and the simulation progresses corre-
sponding to cooling of the whole atomic cloud. Moreover,
it must be stressed that the steady state reached does not
depend on the initial widths of the single wave packets
nor on the initial temperature as long as the atoms are in
the reach of Sisyphus cooling. The simulation times get
longer when the initial temperature is increased but we
want to take into account the eﬀect of collisions on the
cooling dynamics in a realistic way. We also note that the

steady state after cooling in the lattice does not neces-
sarily correspond to a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution
of velocities but a clear steady state corresponding to the
lattice properties is still reached [18].

It should be noted that although we include by default
the recoil eﬀects by absorption and stimulated emission,
we cannot in our quantum approach take proper account
of the Doppler shift which is the basis of the semiclassical
description of Doppler cooling [27]. So in practice we ne-
glect the Doppler cooling mechanism. Adding the recoil
from spontaneous emission will not change this fact, nor
the simulation results. In any case, the role of Doppler
cooling is negligible when compared to the Sisyphus cool-
ing force for the velocities of atoms localized in the lat-
tice [4]. It can, however, have a role in the recapture of
the hotter atoms heated by collisions, so in that sense
our model is limited.

D. Occupation density of lattice

We have performed all the simulations presented in
this paper for an occupation density of ρo = 25% in one
dimension, whereas in our earlier work [9], we presented
also results for other one-dimensional densities in Cs lat-
tices. These previous simulations showed that an occu-
pation density of 25% is suﬃciently high for interesting
eﬀects to appear, namely an evaporative cooling process
which works for at least some parameters of the laser
ﬁeld. The occupation density used in this paper is also
nearly the largest density we can use when the simula-
tions are done in the way presented here. The purpose
of the paper is to further explore the parameter space
and to extend our simulations to other atomic masses in
addition to describing the details of our simulation ap-
proach.

For ρo = 25% the available spatial length for the mov-
ing atom should be equal to λ, corresponding to the aver-
age distance between the atoms. But decreasing the spa-
tial size increases the step size in the momentum space
since δp = 2π/Lz. So to have a suﬃciently ﬁne resolution
in momentum space and still keep ρo = 25%, we choose
Lz = 5λ and set an elastic repulsive potential barrier
such that the allowed spatial length is λ. The forbidden
spatial region thus makes the numerics work properly
without altering the physics. Of course the forbidden
region does not aﬀect the momentum space.

Every fourth lattice is occupied when ρo = 25% or in
other words there is 1 atom per wavelength λ. This cor-
responds to a situation where the ﬁxed atom sits e.g. at
z = 0 and the repulsive elastic potential barrier for the
moving atom is set at z = λ. Then two consecutive col-
lisions are described when the moving atom travels from
the ﬁrst collision region to the repulsive barrier, turns
back, and collides again. Memory eﬀects from previous
collisions are rapidly removed due to decoherence, as also
discussed in Sec. III. This is why we can say that the

10

present model describes collisions in general in a lattice
and not only between the same two atoms.

The dimensionality of the problem and the position
ﬁxing of one atom causes subtleties related to the occu-
pation density: The moving atom travels on average a
distance of 1λ for the ﬁrst collision. After this event it
has to travel a distance 2λ (from zf to zf + 1 and back)
to collide again. The probability is high for a large ki-
netic energy increase during the ﬁrst collision. Thus the
ﬁrst collision has the dominant eﬀect on the kinetic en-
ergy scale relevant to the lattice dynamics. This is why
we rather use here ρo = 25% which corresponds to the
average collision distance of 1λ.

It is not trivial to connect the one-dimensional occu-
pation density to the two- or three-dimensional density,
as that will depend on the particular form of the lat-
tice. It suﬃces to note, though, that a certain occupa-
tion density in one-dimension will typically correspond to
a lower value in higher dimensions, so that e.g. in three
dimensions we expect to see the eﬀects studied here for
three-dimensional occupation densities less than 25%.

E. Interaction at short range

The DDI , Eq. (18), becomes singular at short range.
The singularity in HV is simply removed by replacing r
with r+roﬀ and choosing roﬀ = 10−8. When constructing
the time evolution operator U , we diagonalize HV and
the DDI part in HV produces the eigenvalue manifolds
corresponding to the attractive and repulsive molecular
potentials.

We replace the position dependencies of the attractive

states which are the same as in V axis

dip , Eq. (18), by

1
rn →

1

(rb + roﬀ )n/b , (n = 1, 2, 3)

(30)

in a manner similar to what was done in Ref. [7]. Table V
gives the used values of b, and we show the potentials in
Fig. 6.

The main reason for this ”ﬂattening” of the attrac-
tive state potentials is that considering the numerics, we
have an upper limit to momentum. Thus we need to set a
maximum momentum which can be reached in our simu-
lations by acceleration, but which can still be treated reli-
ably numerically in our integration grid, and is neverthe-
less large enough to correspond to a clear loss process. By
selecting diﬀerent values for b for each molecular poten-
tial we take into account the individual characteristics of
the diﬀerent attractive states and of the atomic elements.
It should be noted that by the time the atoms reach the
artiﬁcially modiﬁed part of the attractive potentials, they
move fast enough to make decay unlikely before they are
reﬂected and move again to the region where the modiﬁ-
cation does not aﬀect the potentials Thus the ﬂattening
of the potentials does not increase the time the atoms

does not enhance radiative decay artiﬁcially.

We concentrate on the radiative heating which occurs
because of the strong decay in the vicinity of rc. In this
region the treatment of the singularity in the DDI and
in the attractive molecular states does not yet aﬀect the
potentials. For example, the removal of the singularity
causes a change in the value of the Cs 0+

The atoms repel each other at the very short range
when their electron clouds begin to overlap. We do not
have to consider the details of the short range repulsion.
Thus the short range repulsion is simply produced by
adding the exponential term α exp(
βr) ǫ to the eigen-
values of HV . For ﬂat states (states other than attractive
or repulsive excited states) α = 30, β = 20 for Cs and Rb,
α = 100, β = 20 for Na [28]. For the attractive excited
state eigenvalue manifolds α = 25, β = 15 for Cs and
Rb, α = 90, β = 15 for Na. Values of α and β are chosen
such that they produce high enough repulsion within a
suﬃciently short range but without producing numerical
diﬃculties because of the contradictory requirements of
height and range.

Finally we emphasize that apart from ﬂattening the
potentials, we perform our calculations in the atom-
atom basis. Thus the molecular states are not used di-
rectly. Unfortunately our dipole-dipole potential takes
care only of the force part of the atomic interaction. The

r-dependence of the lifetimes of the molecular states are
ignored, i.e., each molecular state ends up having the con-
stant atomic linewidth, instead of the retarded linewidth.
This linewidth arises from the fact that the two atoms
couple to the same vacuum modes at diﬀerent locations,
leading to an e−i~k·~r phase diﬀerence term. However, the
atomic lifetimes diﬀer at maximum only by a factor of
2 from the atomic one. The main exception is the 2u
state, which becomes strongly dipole-forbidden and can
support strong survival and thus e.g. favor the ﬁne struc-
ture change loss mechanism over the radiative process.
But we have typically rc <
0.8λ, which means that the
∼
2u state is already hard to excite as well (see Ref. [26]
for a detailed discussion). In order to make the quantum
jump process tractable we use the atom-atom basis, and,
unfortunately, we can not just transform into the molec-
ular basis, change the linewidths into retarded ones, and
then transfer into the atom-atom basis (as we do when
ﬂattening the potentials). This is because for decay, the
lifetimes appear in the jump operators in addition to the
Hamiltonian.

F. Atoms escaping the lattice

|

One needs to deﬁne the critical momentum pc to be
able to calculate the MC ensemble averages and the prop-
erties of the atoms remaining in the lattice. If
< pc
atoms are considered to remain/relocalize in the lattice,
whereas when
pc they are considered lost from the
| ≥
lattice due to a collision or a series of collisions. Semiclas-
sically, we can calculate the critical psc
c where the cooling
force has its maximum value for the parameters used [4].
The cooling force is, of course, still eﬀective for momenta
above psc
c .

Due to the stochastic nature of the jumps, it is not
possible to say if a given high momentum atom will re-
localize or if it is lost from the lattice. Assume that an
atom has a momentum
If the following few
quantum jumps reduce the kinetic energy of the atom,
depending on the atomic position in the lattice, it has a
good chance to relocalize in the lattice. In the opposite
case, where the next few jumps increase the kinetic en-
ergy of the atom, corresponding to jumps from the vicin-
ity of the bottom of the potential well to the vicinity of
the top of the well, the atom has less probability to relo-
calize into the lattice. This means that for two diﬀerent
MC histories with the same initial value of
c one
atom may escape from the lattice whereas the other one
may relocalize. Thus it is not possible to deﬁne pc in a
way that all atoms below pc always relocalize while when

When we calculate the kinetic energy per atom stay-

MC histories in the ensemble averaging that correspond

pc they escape.

ious values of pc. Since there is an increase in the average
kinetic energy as a function of time when the value of pc
used is too large, we may check from the time evolution
of the kinetic energy that our choice for pc is the proper
one when we want to calculate the average kinetic energy
per atom in the lattice. This is because more collisions
occur as the system evolves in time and if the gain in
kinetic energy is too large for the atoms to relocalize in
the lattice, the kinetic energy increases as a function of
time and no steady state is reached, as demonstrated in
Fig. 7. Whereas when we use an appropriate value for
pc, atoms still relocalize in the lattice and the kinetic en-
ergy exhibits a steady state behaviour, cf. Fig. 8. It is at
the transition point between these two diﬀerent types of
behaviours of the kinetic energy that we should choose
the correct value for pc.

Consequently, the atoms of a kinetic energy exceeding
the limit given by pc are neglected when we perform the
ensemble averaging to ﬁnd the result for the kinetic en-

12

ergy per atom remaining in the lattice. It is important
to note that the main result related to the narrowing of
the momentum probability distribution due to collisions
still includes all the calculated histories and is totally
independent of pc.

If there is no constant injection of atoms into the lat-
tice, collisions slowly deplete it. Finally the density is
suﬃciently low that the interactions between atoms are
negligible and the atomic cloud regains the properties de-
termined by the laser parameters only. It should thus be
realized that what we describe here is a temporary cool-
ing process which is not eﬀective when the density has
decreased. What we emphasize is the unexpected be-
haviour of the system in the intermediate regime where
the eﬀect of collisions is not heating but cooling. This
does not represent the nature of the complete dynamics
of the atomic cloud, of course, as there are other mecha-
nisms, such as the radiation pressure from scattered pho-
tons, for both heating and cooling, which are not included
here.

G. Computational resources

The numerical simulations are demanding since we are
dealing with a 36 level quantum system including various
position dependent couplings and dissipative coupling to
the environment. We use 32 processors of an SGI Origin
2000 machine which has 128 MIPS R12000 processors of 1
GB memory per processor [29]. The total memory taken
by a single simulation (ﬁxed δ, Ω, ρo and atomic species)
is 14 GB and generating a single history requires 6 hours
of CPU time. A simulation of 128 ensemble members
then requires a total CPU time which is roughly equal to
one month. The normal clock time is, of course, much
shorter (roughly 22 hours) since we take advantage of
powerful parallel processing.

VII. THE SEMICLASSICAL APPROACH

In this section we describe the semiclassical approach
to calculate the excitation and survival probabilities on
the molecular excited states of our two-atom system.

TABLE VI. Semiclassical probabilities to gain kinetic en-
ergies on various attractive excited state molecular levels, see
Fig. 5, for our Cs584 simulation. The probabilities are cal-
culated for ptot = pcr + ∆p = 40 and pcr = 24, this value of
pcr corresponds to the lattice depth. The wave packet spends
a time t ≥ te on the excited state, PLZ is the Landau-Zener
excitation probability and Pa gives the survival probability.
Ptot = PaPLZ is the total semiclassical probability for the
process p > ptot = 40 to occur.

r-dependence of the excited state (C3/r3) [2]. The basic
idea here is that the short resonance region is approxi-
mated to consist of two spatially linearly behaving states
and each component of the wave packet arriving at the
resonance region is independently excited. A more de-
tailed description can be found in Ref. [2].

One can then calculate the time it takes to reach a
point r on the excited state by using the classical path
approximation

where pcr is the momentum at the Condon point rc.
There is a direct correspondence between the reached
point r on the excited state and the energy gain while ac-
celerating on the attractive excited molecular state. By
using Eq. (32) one can calculate classically how long it
takes to reach a point r corresponding to a given increase
in kinetic energy or momentum due to the acceleration
on the attractive excited state.

It is now easy to numerically calculate the kinetic en-
ergy increase due to the collisions if the wave packet stays
on the attractive excited state for a time corresponding
to the natural decay time Γ−1. When the exponential
decay from the excited state is also taken into account,
the probabilities for various kinetic energy gains due to
collisions as a function of relative velocity of the colliding
atoms at rc may also be calculated [7].

that pcr = 24 corresponding to the lattice depth used
already gives a total momentum of ptot = 67 after a col-
lision thus pushing the atom to the region in momentum
space where its probability for relocalizing back to the
lattice is small (psc
c = 16.2). This shows in a clear way
that increases in kinetic energy that are large compared
to the latttice modulation depth U0 may occur on a time
scale of Γ−1.

Moreover, when the exponential decay and PLZ,
Eq. (31), are taken into account, one is able to calcu-
late the probabilities to gain various amounts of kinetic
energies due to the collision. The total probability Ptot
for the atomic momentum to have at least the value ptot
after the collision is

Ptot = PaPLZ

(33)

where Pa gives the survival probability on the excited
state. An example of the results of Ptot are shown in
Table VI. This suggests that the ﬁrst resonance molecu-
lar potential 0+
u has a dominant role in collisions. For
ptot = 40 the probabilities for the various states are
roughly equal but if the ﬁrst resonance potential excites
and accelerates half of the colliding atoms only half of
them is left for the remaining potentials.

The simple semi-classical calculation above is not able
to give quantitative results but it shows that the prob-
ability to produce an atom of large momentum due to
a collision is high already when we consider one excited
level only. This probability increases when we take into
account that during one collision process, the molecule
may be excited at four diﬀerent values of rc related to
ﬁve diﬀerent attractive states.

VIII. SIMULATION RESULTS

The calculated numerical values of kinetic energy per
atom for various simulations are shown in Table VII
and corresponding momentum probability distributions
in Figs. 10–15.

Most of the simulations with the selected parameters
produce a reduced value for the kinetic energy per atom
when the interactions between the atoms are taken into
account, see Table VII. Since the inelastic collisions here
always increase the kinetic energy of the atoms via the
radiative heating mechanism, our results suggest that the
consequence of collision almost every time is the escape of
the colliding high energy atoms from the lattice [30]. The
atoms left in the lattice then have less average energy.
This is due to the fact that the more energetic atoms
are favoured to participate in the collision process due to
their better ability to move between the lattice sites.

The cooling process is indeed observed when looking
for the momentum probability distributions including all
the MC histories for ensemble averaging, see Figs. 10–
15. One can see the slight narrowing of the momentum
distributions corresponding to the cooling process. The

narrow central peak corresponds to atoms localized in the
lattice sites and the broader background wing to atoms
which are above the recapture range and do not relocalize
in the lattice. This resembles the evaporative cooling
process with narrowed central peak and hot background
atoms. Cooling here is not dramatic but still present.
Moreover, the result is in sharp contrast when compared
to the theoretical and experimental collision studies in
MOT’s where the heating of the trapped atoms due to
the radiative mechanism is observed [2,7] but not the
evaporative-type cooling process.

The cooling process is observed for all the three atomic
masses when similar lattice depths are used. The compu-
tational resources that simulations require, see Sec. VI G,
do not allow any extensive exploration of parameter space
but the Cs1621 result shows that with a deeper lattice
the situation may change, see Table VII. In shallow lat-
tices the relative velocity before a collision is small, thus
enhancing the excitation probability. In deep lattices the
reduced excitation probability due to large relative ve-
locity is compensated by the use of more intense lasers.
The Cs1621 result suggests that in deeper lattices one
may observe heating which is similar to the results from

MOT studies. But a systematic study of this is out of
the reach of this paper.

IX. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Our results show the basic aspects of one mechanism
aﬀecting the thermodynamics of the atomic cloud in an
optical lattice, when the lattice has been prepared with
near-resonant (detuning a few linewidths), red-detuned
laser light. In this case the role of inelastic collisions is
strong, leading to heating and loss of atoms, but this re-
quires that the interacting atoms are located in the same
lattice site. This, on the other hand, requires, ﬁrstly,
large atomic densities. Therefore in most lattice stud-
ies done so far, the role of collisions has been negligible
due to the low densities, or at least not easy to observe
(with the exception of collisions producing a clear signal
such as Penning ionisation of colliding metastable rare
gas atoms [31]).

Secondly, frequent collisions require clear mobility of
atoms. This takes place naturally during the Sisyphus
cooling until the atoms are localized in lattice sites. Thus

it is important for suitably dense samples to study the
role of collisions during the Sisyphus cooling, and our ap-
proach provides a method which is both dynamical and
consistent. For the selected parameters our simulations
show that the Sisyphus cooling process and localization
of atoms is not prohibited by inelastic processes, i.e., the
loss and heating of atoms remains small even when the
average distance between the two atoms is only four lat-
tice sites.

Once the localization in lattice sites has been achieved
as a steady state, the question about the mobility of
atoms changes to some extent. It should be noted that
localization does not mean that an atom remains in the
same site ad inﬁnitum. In the steady state the atoms are
localized at the sites for most of the time, but also move
between the sites via tunneling (in the picture where the
lattice lasers and the excited states are eliminated from
the eﬀective description). For the selected parameters
the dipole-dipole interaction does not perturb the lat-
tice potentials enough to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect between
atoms located at diﬀerent sites (the opposite situation is
also possible, see Ref. [11]). The tunneling of atoms be-
tween sites is in the steady state the main process leading
to inelastic collisions, and as the simulations show (sup-
ported by the semiclassical estimates) such encounters
lead mainly to loss of hotter atoms or their selective heat-
ing. This is because the hotter atoms, naturally, move
between the sites more frequently than the colder ones,
creating the selectivity. If the lost atoms are not consid-
ered, our results show, however, that we can hold on to
the concept of an existing steady state.

The collisionally induced velocity-selective loss of hot
atoms is similar to the evaporative cooling which is
utilised in magnetic traps to reach ultracold temperatures
for atoms. It remains to be seen, however, whether the
resulting cooling eﬀect for the atoms is signiﬁcant enough
to be observed in densely ﬁlled lattices. In dense samples
other processes such as reabsorption of photons scattered
by the atoms are another important source for heating,
which may well overcome any cooling eﬀect. It should
be noted, however, that if we ignore the spatial structure

of the cooling ﬁelds, the collisional processes lose their
velocity-selective nature, and as seen in the simulations
of Ref. [7], this leads to strong heating of atoms. Here
the simulations indicate that the lattice structure inhibits
this heating clearly.

Our simulations have been very intense computation-
ally, which makes it very diﬃcult to make the model more
realistic. Our studies, however, to our opinion, demon-
strate the basic features to be expected from the colli-
sions in densely populated near-resonant red-detuned lat-
tices. There are magnetic-ﬁeld-assisted cooling schemes
J = 1 systems.
for blue-detuned lattices for e.g. J = 1
The blue detuning usually leads to optical shielding, and
the collisional contribution to inelastic processes is re-
duced strongly for normal laser cooling intensities as the
loss channel is expected to be adiabatically closed, see
Ref. [32]. As a future prospect it will be interesting to
study the qualitative diﬀerences due to the color of the
detuning in collisions between atoms in near-resonant lat-
tices.

[28] These are also the values used for all the states (for Cs,
Rb and Na respectively) to produce the needed reﬂective
boundary conditions by the repulsive exponential poten-
tial barrier. When using the Crank-Nicholson method to
solve Eq. (19) it is easy to use the reﬂecting boundary
conditions. Instead we use the FFT-method since it is
computationally faster in the system studied here.

[29] See http://www.csc.ﬁ for details.
[30] We have also estimated the number of collision processes
by monitoring the quantum ﬂux over average distance
za in single particle MC simulations. This estimate gives
similar results as the number of high energy atoms pro-
duced when interactions between atoms have been in-
cluded.

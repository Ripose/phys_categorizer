We have generalized the BOUND and MOLSCAT packages to allow calculations in basis sets
where the monomer Hamiltonians are oﬀ-diagonal and used the new capability to carry out bound-
state and scattering calculations on 3He-NH and 4He-NH as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. Following
the bound-state energies to the point where they cross thresholds gives very precise predictions of
the magnetic ﬁelds at which zero-energy Feshbach resonances occur. We have used this to locate
and characterize two very narrow Feshbach resonances in 3He-NH. Such resonances can be used to
tune elastic and inelastic collision cross sections, and sweeping the magnetic ﬁeld across them will
allow a form of quantum control in which separated atoms and molecules are associated to form
complexes. For the ﬁrst resonance, where only elastic scattering is possible, the scattering length
shows a pole as a function of magnetic ﬁeld and there is a very large peak in the elastic cross section.
For the second resonance, however, inelastic scattering is also possible. In this case the pole in the
scattering length is dramatically suppressed and the cross sections show relatively small peaks. The
peak suppression is expected to be even larger in systems with stronger inelasticity. The results
suggest that calculations on ultracold molecular inelastic collisions may be much less sensitive to
details of the potential energy surface than has been believed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Over the last 5 years, it has become possible to con-
trol the behavior of ultracold atomic gases by tuning the
interactions between atoms using applied magnetic ﬁelds
[1, 2]. Notable successes have included the controlled im-
plosion of Bose-Einstein condensates [3] and the produc-
tion of molecules in both bosonic [4, 5, 6, 7] and fermionic
[8, 9, 10, 11] quantum gases. Long-lived molecular Bose-
Einstein condensates of fermion dimers have been pro-
duced [12, 13, 14], and the ﬁrst signatures of ultracold
triatomic [15] and tetraatomic [16] molecules have been
observed. The new capabilities in atomic physics have
had important applications in other areas: for example,
the tunability of atomic interactions has allowed explo-
ration of the crossover between Bose-Einstein condensa-
tion (BEC) and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer (BCS) behav-
ior in dilute gases [17, 18, 19].

In parallel with the work on atomic gases, there have
been intense eﬀorts to cool molecules directly from high
temperature to the ultracold regime. Molecules such as
NH3, OH and NH have been cooled from room tempera-
ture to the milliKelvin regime by a variety of methods in-
cluding buﬀer-gas cooling [20, 21] and Stark deceleration
[22, 23]. Directly cooled molecules have been success-
fully trapped at temperatures around 10 mK, and there
are a variety of proposals for ways to cool them further,
including evaporative cooling, sympathetic cooling and
cavity-assisted cooling [24, 25].

The possibility of controlling molecular interactions in
the same way as atomic interactions is of great interest.

Several groups have begun to explore the eﬀects of ex-
ternal ﬁelds on ultracold molecular collisions [26]. Volpi
and Bohn [27] investigated collisions of 17O2 with He and
found a very strong enhancement of spin-ﬂipping cross
sections even for weak magnetic ﬁelds. Krems et al. [28]
and Cybulski et al. [29] investigated spin-ﬂipping colli-
sions of NH with He and found a similar dependence on
magnetic ﬁeld. Krems and Dalgarno [30, 31] elaborated
the formal theory of scattering in a magnetic ﬁeld for
a variety of atom-molecule and molecule-molecule cases
involving molecules in 2Σ and 3Σ states. Ticknor and
Bohn [32] investigated OH+OH collisions and found that
in this case magnetic ﬁelds could suppress inelastic col-
lisions. Lara et al. [33, 34] investigated the very com-
plicated case of OH + Rb collisions, using basis sets de-
signed to allow a magnetic ﬁeld to be applied, though
their initial calculations were for zero ﬁeld.

The eﬀects of electric ﬁelds have also been investi-
gated. Avdeenkov and Bohn [35, 36] investigated OH-
OH collisions in the presence of electric ﬁelds that caused
alignment of the molecules. They identiﬁed novel ﬁeld-
linked states arising from long-range avoided crossings
between eﬀective potential curves in the presence of a
ﬁeld [36, 37, 38, 39]. Avdeenkov et al. [40] have also
investigated the eﬀects of very high electric ﬁelds on col-
lisions of closed-shell molecules. Very recently, Tscher-
bul and Krems [41] have explored the eﬀect of combined
electric and magnetic ﬁelds on He-CaH collisions and ob-
served signiﬁcant suppression of spin-ﬂipping transitions
at high electric ﬁelds in the cold regime (

0.5 K).

An important technique used to produce dimers in ul-

tracold atomic gases is magnetic tuning across Feshbach
resonances [1, 2]. A Feshbach resonance [42, 43] occurs
whenever a bound state associated with one potential
curve lies above the threshold for another curve. The
resonance thus corresponds to a level embedded in a con-
tinuum, which is a quasibound state. In the atomic case,
the thresholds that produce low-energy Feshbach reso-
nances are associated with diﬀerent hyperﬁne states of
the interacting atoms. It is often possible to tune a reso-
nance across threshold (from above or below) by applying
a magnetic ﬁeld. This produces an avoided crossing be-
tween atomic and molecular states. If the magnetic ﬁeld
is tuned across the resonance slowly enough to follow the
avoided crossing adiabatically, pairs of atoms can be con-
verted into molecules or vice versa.

Molecules have a much richer energy level structure
than atoms, and there are many additional types of Fes-
hbach resonance. In particular, rotational Feshbach res-
onances can occur [44, 45] and have signiﬁcant inﬂuences
on ultracold molecular collisions [46]. Other small energy
level splittings, such as spin-rotation and Λ-doubling, can
also cause resonances in molecular scattering.
It is of
great interest to characterize such resonances and their
ﬁeld-dependence, both to understand their inﬂuence on
collision cross sections and to prepare the ground for
experiments that associate molecules by Feshbach res-
onance tuning.

The NH molecule is particularly topical in cold and ul-
tracold molecule studies. It is a dipolar molecule with a
3Σ− ground state, so it is both electrostatically and mag-
netically trappable. It has been cooled by beam-loaded
buﬀer-gas cooling [21] and is a promising candidate for
molecular beam deceleration and trapping [47]. Krems
et al. [28] and Cybulski et al. [29] have calculated poten-
tial energy surfaces for He-NH and used them in scatter-
ing calculations. Cybulski et al. also calculated zero-ﬁeld
bound states of the He-NH Van der Waals complex. An
electronic excitation spectrum of the Van der Waals com-
plex has been observed by Kerenskaya et al. [48]. Sold´an
and Hutson [49] have investigated the interaction poten-
tials for NH with Rb, and Dhont et al. [50] have devel-
oped interaction potential energy surfaces for NH-NH in
the singlet, triplet and quintet states.

In the present article we describe the ﬁrst calculations
of the bound states of a Van der Waals complex in a mag-
netic ﬁeld. We show how such calculations can be used to
locate zero-energy Feshbach resonances as a function of
applied ﬁeld. Elastic and inelastic cross sections can then
be tuned by sweeping the ﬁeld across the Feshbach res-
onance. Such ﬁeld sweeps could also be used to transfer
unbound atom-molecule or molecule-molecule pairs into
bound states of the corresponding complex.

A remarkable conclusion of the present paper is that, in
the presence of inelastic scattering, the poles in scattering
lengths that characterize low-energy Feshbach resonances
in atomic systems [2] are dramatically suppressed and
elastic and inelastic cross sections show relatively small
peaks as resonances cross thresholds. The numerical re-

2

sults obtained here allow us to test analytical formulae
for this eﬀect recently given by Hutson [51].

II. METHODS FOR BOUND-STATE

We consider the case of an NH molecule interacting
with a He atom in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. The
Hamiltonian for this in Jacobi coordinates (R, θ) is

tation, ˆHmon is the Hamiltonian for the NH monomer, ˆHZ
is the Zeeman interaction and V (R, θ) is the intermolecu-
lar potential. For simplicity we consider the NH molecule
to be a rigid rotor, but the generalization to include NH
vibrations is straightforward. The NH monomer Hamil-
tonian is therefore

ˆHmon = ¯h−2bNH ˆN 2 + ˆHSN + ˆHSS,

ues for the spin-rotation and spin-spin constants are
γ =

0.0055 cm−1 and λSS = 0.920 cm−1 [53].

There are several basis sets that could be used to ex-
pand the eigenfunctions of Eq. (1). We consider two of
them in the present work, which we refer to as the cou-
pled and uncoupled basis sets. Both basis sets represent
the end-over-end rotation with quantum numbers
,
LMLi
|
where L is a rotational quantum number and ML is its
projection onto the space-ﬁxed Z axis.

We use the convention that quantum numbers that de-
scribe a monomer are represented with lower-case letters,
and reserve capital letters to describe states of the com-
plex as a whole. In the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld (or
a perturbing atom), the rotational states of NH are ap-
proximately described by quantum numbers n, s and j,
where n represents the mechanical rotational of NH, s
is the electron spin, and j is the vector sum of n and
s. In the coupled representation for the He-NH problem,

where mn and ms are the projections of n and s individ-
ually.

In both basis sets we use, the matrix elements of ˆL2
are diagonal in all quantum numbers and are simply

¯h2L(L+1). The rotational part of the monomer Hamilto-
nian is also diagonal, with matrix elements bNHn(n + 1).

We solve the bound-state Hamiltonian by a coupled channel method [55]. Denoting a complete set of channel

In the present work we solve the coupled equations to ﬁnd
bound states using the BOUND program [56], which uses
the algorithms described in ref. 55. For N channels there
are N coupled equations. However, it is actually neces-
sary to propagate a set of N linearly independent solu-
tions, so χ(R) is an N
N matrix. The log-derivative ma-
trix Y = (dχ/dR)χ−1 is propagated outwards from Rmin
and inwards from Rmax to a common matching point
Rmid in the classically allowed region of the potential us-
ing Johnson’s algorithm [57]. This is done for a series of
trial energies. If the energy is an eigenvalue of the Hamil-
tonian, the determinant of the log-derivative matching
Yout is zero. Bound states are lo-
matrix Ymatch = Yin −
cated by searching for zeroes of eigenvalues of Ymatch as a
function of energy. The log-derivative method provides a
generalised node count [55, 58] which increases by one at
each energy eigenvalue, and this allows us to use bisection
to identify regions of energy that contain a bound state.
The actual convergence on an energy eigenvalue uses the
secant method, which gives quadratic convergence.

Version 5 of the BOUND program [56] contained an
interface to allow new basis sets to be added, but could
only handle basis sets in which the monomer Hamiltonian
was diagonal. We have extended the program to remove
this restriction and implemented the coupled and uncou-
pled basis sets described above. We have also built in
new loops over external ﬁelds to simplify calculations on
Stark and Zeeman eﬀects.

III. RESULTS OF BOUND-STATE
CALCULATIONS

We have carried out bound-state calculations on 4He-
NH and 3He-NH using the potential energy surface of
Krems et al. [28] (described in more detail as potential 2
of Cybulski et al. [29]). The basis set included all func-
7. The coupled equations were
tions with n
propagated outwards from 1.8 ˚A to 3.57 ˚A and inwards
from 16.0 ˚A to 3.57 ˚A using a log-derivative sector size
of 0.025 ˚A. WKB boundary conditions were applied in
each channel at Rmax to improve the convergence.

In zero ﬁeld, the levels of He-NH are characterized by
the total angular momentum
, which is the vector sum
J
of j and L. The total parity is also conserved and is given
1)n+L+1. Since the lowest levels of NH have n = 0,
by (
levels
j = s = 1 and
corresponding to each value of L are very close together:
the separation is only about 10−3 cm−1 for L = 1. The
angular momentum coupling scheme corresponds to case
(B) of Dubernet, Flower and Hutson [59].

The ﬁeld-free energies of He-NH on this potential have
been calculated previously by Cybulski et al. [29]. Our
10−4 cm−1 for the levels
results agree with theirs to
with L = 0 to 2, but are approximately 0.0014 cm−1
lower for the L = 3 levels of 4He-NH, which are bound
by only 0.765 cm−1. We attribute the diﬀerence to lack
of convergence of the radial basis set used in their calcu-
lations. The results obtained from our program with the
10−9
coupled and uncoupled basis sets are identical to
cm−1, which conﬁrms the correctness of the code.

belled with the approximate quantum numbers mn = 0

number except in the vicinity of the avoided crossings.
The major diﬀerence between MJ values is that some
ms levels are missing for MJ
= 0, but there are also
small shifts of all the energy levels. A similar plot for
4He-NH with MJ = 0 is shown in Fig. 2.

As expected, the Zeeman eﬀect is generally quite linear
for He-NH in the range of ﬁelds studied. This is because
for n = 0 the only oﬀ-diagonal terms are those of V (R, θ)
and ˆHSS that mix in excited n levels, and the spacing
between the n = 0 and n = 1 levels for NH is around 32.6
cm−1. Nevertheless, there are avoided crossings where
levels of the same MJ and parity but diﬀerent ms cross.
Expanded views of the energy level diagrams in the region

of avoided crossings are shown for 4He in Fig. 3 and for
3He in Fig. 4.
It may be seen that in this system the
crossings are very tightly avoided, with spacings at the
10−4 cm−1 and ∆E =

The reason that the crossings are so tightly avoided in
this case is that there are no direct oﬀ-diagonal matrix
elements between n = 0 basis functions with diﬀerent
values of ms. The dominant coupling is a second-order
one of the form

m′

If matrix elements of ˆHSS oﬀ-diagonal in n are omitted,
the avoided crossings still exist but are about a factor of 5
tighter. Under these circumstances they are caused by a
third-order mechanism in which potential couplings mix
in basis functions with n > 0 (but the same values of ms
and m′

s) and these are connected by ˆHSS.

It should be noted that for levels with n > 0 there are
direct matrix elements of ˆHSS and ˆHNS that connect lev-
els with diﬀerent ms but the same mj. This will produce

states. These are of two types: states that are predomi-
nantly in an open channel, which have no physical signiﬁ-
cance; and states that are predominantly in a closed chan-
nel, which correspond closely to quasibound states of the
real system but with only an approximate open-channel
(dissociative) component. The two types are very easy
to tell apart: the open-channel states are closely parallel
to a lower threshold, and inspection of the wavefunction
conﬁrms their parentage. The open-channel states have
been omitted from Figs. 1 and 2. The closed-channel
states are shown as dashed lines above the lowest thresh-
old. They allow us to estimate very precisely where a
bound or quasibound state crosses a threshold, and thus
where a zero-energy resonance is expected in the scatter-
ing. This information will be used in section V below.

IV. METHODS FOR SCATTERING
CALCULATIONS

The coupled equations needed for scattering calcula-
tions are identical to those for bound states. The only

The usual procedure for obtaining the scattering ma-
trix S from the log-derivative matrix Y has been de-
scribed by Johnson [57]. Each channel is either open,
E
Ei or closed, E < Ei. If matching takes place at a
ﬁnite distance Rmax where the wavefunction in the closed
channels (E < Ei) has not decayed to zero, it is necessary
to take account of the closed channels. The asymptotic
form of the wavefunction is

≥

χ(R) = J(R) + N (R)K,

are N channels and Nopen open channels, the N

log-derivative matrix is converted into an N
symmetric K matrix. The S matrix is then obtained from
the open-open submatrix, Koo, using the relationship

×

S = (I + iKoo)−1(I

iKoo),

(19)

−

where I is an Nopen ×
Nopen unit matrix. However, the
boundary conditions (18) are appropriate only in a basis
set in which both ˆL2 and the asymptotic Hamiltonian are
diagonal. In our generalised version of MOLSCAT, the
log-derivative matrix Y is propagated in the primitive
basis set (which is nondiagonal) and then transformed at
Rmax into a basis set that diagonalises ˆHmon + ˆHZ.

For the simple case of He-NH, the eigenvalues of
ˆHmon + ˆHZ are nondegenerate except at non-zero ﬁeld.
The transformation that diagonalises ˆHmon + ˆHZ is thus
unique. However, in more complicated cases with two
structured collision partners it will be necessary to trans-
form to a basis set that diagonalises ˆHmon,1 + ˆHZ,1 and
ˆHmon,2 + ˆHZ,2 separately. Additional degeneracies arise
at zero ﬁeld, and resolving them may require diagonali-
sation of another operator such as ˆjZ .

B. Cross sections

The cross section for a transition i

f from initial
state i to ﬁnal state f is obtained from the square of the
corresponding T matrix element,

over all channels corresponding to the monomer levels of
interest and over S matrices obtained for diﬀerent values
of MJ and parity.

C. Scattering lengths

In the ultracold regime, scattering properties are often

described in terms of a complex scattering length a = α
−
iβ [61]. The diagonal S-matrix element in the incoming
channel 0 may be written in terms of a complex phase
shift δ,

and the scattering length is deﬁned by

S00 = exp(2iδ)

a = lim

The scattering length becomes constant at limitingly low
energy and the elastic and total inelastic cross sections
are then

D. Resonant behavior

If there is only one open channel, then the phase shift
δ is real and its behavior is suﬃcient to characterize a
resonance. It follows a Breit-Wigner form as a function
of energy,

E) (cid:21)

where δbg is a slowly varying background term, E0 is the
resonance position and ΓE is its width (in energy space).
This corresponds to the S matrix element describing a
circle of radius 1 in the complex plane. In general the
parameters δbg, E0 and ΓE are slow functions of energy,
but this is neglected in the present work.

As a function of magnetic ﬁeld at constant kinetic en-

ergy, the phase shift follows a form similar to Eq. 26,

δ(B) = δbg + tan−1

(27)

ΓB

The width ΓB is a signed quantity that is negative if
the bound state tunes upwards through the energy of
interest and positive if it tunes downwards. The back-
ground phase shift δbg goes to zero as k
0 according
to Eq. 22 (with ﬁnite abg), but the resonant term still
exists. The scattering length passes through a pole when
δ =
π. The scattering length follows the formula
commonly used in atomic scattering [62],

When there are several open channels, δ is in gen-
eral complex. The quantity that then follows the Breit-
Wigner form (26) or (27) is the S-matrix eigenphase sum
[44], which is the sum of phases of the eigenvalues of the
S matrix. The eigenphase sum is real, because the S ma-
trix is unitary, so that all its eigenvalues have modulus 1.
In practice the eigenphase sum is most conveniently cal-
culated by diagonalising the real symmetric matrix Koo
and summing the inverse tangents of its eigenvalues.

If there is more than one open channel, the individual
S matrix elements still describe circles in the complex

V. RESULTS OF SCATTERING
CALCULATIONS

We have carried out scattering calculations on 4He-NH
and 3He-NH using the potential energy surface of Krems
et al. [28]. These calculations used a reduced basis set
of functions with n
5 to allow comparison
with previous studies. The coupled equations were prop-
agated outwards from 1.7 ˚A to 120.0 ˚A using Johnson’s
log-derivative algorithm [57] with a sector size of 0.025
˚A.

4 and L

≤

≤

We have veriﬁed that the new code gives identical scat-
tering results for He-NH with the coupled and uncoupled
basis sets. This conﬁrms the correctness of the coding
for the basis sets and the extraction of S matrices. Our
program also gives identical results to refs. 28 and 29 for
scattering in a magnetic ﬁeld.

It is of great interest to investigate the eﬀect of zero-
energy Feshbach resonances on low-energy molecular
scattering as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. However, a
major problem is that the resonances can be very narrow,
and locating the ﬁelds at which they occur is diﬃcult and
time-consuming. For example, in the He-NH problem
we expect the coupling between bound and continuum
states with diﬀerent mj to be comparable to or smaller
than that between bound states of diﬀerent mj. To a
ﬁrst approximation, the latter is the energy separation of
the bound-state avoided crossings, which is around 10−3
cm−1. Since the energy of a state with ms =
1 tunes by
about 10−4 cm−1/G, we expect the Feshbach resonances
to be less (perhaps much less) than 10 G wide.

±

Fortunately,

the bound-state capability described
above provides a solution to this problem: we can ex-
trapolate the bound-state energies to calculate the ﬁeld
at which they cross a threshold and then scan across a

small range of ﬁelds in the vicinity. As an example, we
searched for Feshbach resonances in 3He-NH. It may be
seen in Fig. 1 that there is a 3He-NH bound state with
ms = +1 that crosses the ms =
1 threshold at about
7200 G and the ms = 0 threshold at about 14300 G.
Careful extrapolation of the bound-state energies with
the basis set used for the scattering calculations gives
more precise ﬁeld estimates of 7168.750 G (for MJ =
1)
and 14340.36 G (for MJ = 0) respectively.

−

−

Care must be taken to use bound-state calculations
for the correct values of MJ and parity. In the present
case, we want s-wave resonances, with L = 0 in the in-
coming channel. This requires MJ = mj and even par-
ity. Bound-state calculations with diﬀerent values of MJ
produce energies that cross threshold at diﬀerent values
of the ﬁeld. In He-NH, which is a very weakly coupled
system with almost linear Zeeman eﬀects, the ﬁelds are
only slightly diﬀerent; for example, the crossing with the
ms = 0 threshold occurs at 14345.40 G for MJ =
1.
Nevertheless, the diﬀerence can easily be enough to miss
the resonance, and in more strongly coupled systems will

For 3He colliding with NH (ms =

only elastic scattering can occur. For MJ =

even parity, the present basis set gives 3 open channels
with L = 0, 2 and 4. Scattering into the L > 0 chan-
nels is strongly suppressed by the centrifugal barriers.
The elastic cross section is shown as a function of ﬁeld in
Fig. 5 and the corresponding eigenphase sum and scat-
tering length are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The peak in

matrix element for L = 0 describes a circle of radius 1

resonance, as shown in Fig. 8. Fitting the eigenphase
sum to Eq. 27 gives δbg < 0.001, B0 = 7168.7555 G and

At 10−3 K the resonance is shifted slightly because a dif-
ferent ﬁeld is needed to bring the bound state into reso-
nance with the larger total energy. Apart from the shift,
however, the cross sections behave as expected from the
Wigner threshold laws: the elastic cross section is almost
unchanged and the inelastic cross section scales with k−1.
A notable feature of Fig. 9 is that the elastic cross
section does not peak at the very high value of 4π/k2
characteristic of a pole in the scattering length. The real
and imaginary parts of the scattering length are shown
, the scattering length

The other diagonal elements describe much larger circles
that are almost independent of k, with background (non-
resonant) S matrix elements (shown by crosses) that are
far from 1: these channels have substantial kinetic energy
so are not governed by the Wigner threshold laws. The
inelastic S matrix elements are shown in Fig. 13, and it
may be seen that those for incoming channel 0 describe
circles with radius proportional to k1/2.

Since S00 describes a small circle in the complex plane,
the corresponding complex phase δ given by Eq. 21 shows
a relatively small oscillation that does not pass through
π/2. There is thus an oscillation but no pole in the scat-
±
tering length a (and no discontinuity in its sign). This
explains why the peak in the elastic scattering cross sec-
tion is much lower than the value of 4π/k2 expected when
there is a pole in a.

The resulting proﬁles are shown in Figs. 9 and 10, using
the parameters determined from the S matrix elements
without reﬁtting to the scattering lengths and cross sec-
tions.

It is remarkable that, even in a system as weakly
coupled as He-NH, the behavior of the cross sections
and scattering lengths is so diﬀerent from the elastic
case. It has been common in theoretical studies of atom-
atom scattering to model Feshbach resonances using a 2-
channel treatment with one closed and one open channel.
The present results make it clear that such an approxi-
mation may miss essential features of the physics, and in
particular may predict unphysical poles in the scattering
length.

Feshbach resonances with L > 0 in the incoming chan-
nel can also occur, but are suppressed at ultralow energies
because of the centrifugal barrier. 3He-NH has a very low
reduced mass, and with a long-range potential given by
0 the heights and positions
−
of the centrifugal barriers for L = 1 to 4 are given in
Table I. Because of this, no zero-energy resonance was
observed for MJ =
1 near 14345 G, even though there
−
is a state that crosses the threshold there.

C6R−6 with C6 = 7.84Eh a6

We should emphasize the advantage of using coupled-
channel methods rather than basis-set methods for bound
states when attempting to locate zero-energy Feshbach
resonances. Basis-set methods lose accuracy close to dis-
sociation because of the diﬃculty of representing near-
dissociation and continuum functions with basis sets. In
coupled-channel methods, by contrast, the behavior of
the wavefunction at long range can be built in by apply-
ing WKB boundary conditions at Rmax. Because of this,
the approximations in the bound-state calculations are
very similar to those in scattering calculations with the
same basis set, and as we have shown this allows very
precise estimates of resonance positions.

VI. RELATIVE MERITS OF DIFFERENT BASIS
SETS

The coupled and uncoupled basis sets give identical
results for bound-state energies and for collision proper-
ties, and in this sense they are equivalent. However, the

11

uncoupled basis set is a little easier to program and its
matrix elements are easier to generalize to more compli-
cated cases (such as those involving nuclear spin or two
structured monomers). In addition, the uncoupled basis
set gives a much simpler representation of the wavefunc-
tions for bound states and resonances in any signiﬁcant
magnetic ﬁeld. We therefore intend to use uncoupled
basis sets in future work.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have modiﬁed the BOUND and MOLSCAT pack-
ages to allow the use of basis sets in which the asymptotic
Hamiltonian is non-diagonal and used the new capabil-
ity to perform bound-state and scattering calculations on
He-NH in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. The bound-
state capability makes it possible to locate zero-energy
Feshbach resonances as a function of magnetic ﬁeld even
when they are very narrow. The new capability pro-
vides a very straightforward way to program new cou-
pling cases and collision types, and in future work we
will use it to investigate low-energy scattering of systems
containing two structured monomers in electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds.

For He-NH, we have located two zero-energy Feshbach
resonances involving an ms = +1 level of the He-NH
complex tuned through the ms =
1 and ms = 0 thresh-
olds. The two resonances show very diﬀerent behavior
as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. For the resonance at
the ms =
1 threshold, only elastic scattering is possi-
ble and the resonance shows the classic behavior famil-
iar from ultracold atom-atom scattering. The scattering
length passes through a pole at resonance and the elastic
cross section shows a very large peak. For the resonance
at the ms = 0 threshold, however, inelastic scattering is
also possible. The pole in the scattering length is dra-
matically suppressed, and the peak in the elastic cross
section is far smaller than would be expected if a pole
were present.

Our results provide a numerical demonstration of the
eﬀects recently predicted by Hutson [51], who param-
eterized the strength of the resonant contribution with
a resonant scattering length ares. For the inelastic reso-
nance that we have characterized in He-NH, the resonant
scattering length is only 8.96 ˚A.

The suppression of resonant peaks in cross sections by
inelastic scattering will be a very general eﬀect. Most
molecular systems have stronger inelasticity than He-NH,
and will have even smaller resonant scattering lengths.
In such cases the peaks will be even more strongly sup-
pressed than here. The eﬀect explains previously puz-
zling results in Na + Na2 [64] and Li + Li2 [65] scattering,
where it was found that cross sections for ultracold colli-
sions of vibrationally excited molecules were only weakly
dependent on potential parameters and showed no sharp
peaks when Feshbach resonances were tuned through zero
energy. The lack of such peaks is now seen to be due to

suppression by inelastic processes. This suggests that
calculations on ultracold collisions of molecules in the
presence of inelasticity may be much less sensitive to po-
tential details than was previously expected.

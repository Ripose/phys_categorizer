We report the observation of the higher order frequency shift due to the trapping ﬁeld in a 87Sr
optical lattice clock. We show that at the magic wavelength of the lattice, where the ﬁrst order term
cancels, the higher order shift will not constitute a limitation to the fractional accuracy of the clock
−18. This result is achieved by operating the clock at very high trapping intensity
at a level of 10
up to 400 kW/cm2 and by a speciﬁc study of the eﬀect of the two two-photon transitions near the
magic wavelength.

The recent proposal and preliminary realizations of op-
tical lattice clocks open a promising route towards fre-
quency standards with a fractional accuracy better than
10−17 [1, 2, 3, 4]. A large number of atoms are conﬁned
in micro-traps formed by the interference pattern of laser
beams which in principle allows both the high signal to
noise ratio of optical clocks with neutral atoms [5] and
the cancellation of motional eﬀects of trapped ion de-
vices [6, 7, 8, 9]. In contrast to the ion case an optical
lattice clock requires high trapping ﬁelds. The evaluation
of their eﬀects on the clock transition is a major concern
and is the subject of this letter. For a Sr optical lattice
clock, the typical requirement in terms of trapping depth
is about 10 Er with Er the recoil energy associated to
the absorption of a lattice photon [10]. The correspond-
ing frequency shift of both clock states amounts to 36 kHz
at 800 nm, while a relative accuracy goal of 10−18 implies
a control of the diﬀerential shift at the 0.5 mHz level, or
10−8 in fractional units.

The frequency of the clock transition in a laser trap
of depth U0 is shifted with respect to the unperturbed
frequency ν0 according to

with ν1 and ν2 proportional to the (dynamic) polariz-
ability and hyperpolarizability diﬀerence between both
states of the clock transition [1]. By principle of the op-
tical lattice clock, ν1 cancels when the laser which forms
the lattice is tuned to the ”magic wavelength” λm. Al-
though this remains to be demonstrated experimentally,
a control of this ﬁrst order term to better than 1 mHz
seems achievable [1].

The higher order term is a priori more problematic
with no expected cancellation. A theoretical calculation
of the eﬀect is reported in Ref. [1] predicting a frequency
shift of −2 µHz/E2
r for a linear polarization of the lattice.
The calculation however was performed at the theoretical
magic wavelength of 800 nm. The actual value [17], λm =
813.428(1) nm (see [2, 3] and below), lies near two two-
photon resonances which may considerably enhance the

eﬀect and impede the realization of an accurate clock.
The ﬁrst one couples 5s5p 3P0 to 5s7p 1P1 (Fig. 1) and
is at a wavelength of 813.36 nm, or equivalently 30 GHz
away from the magic wavelength. Although this J =
0 → J = 1 two-photon transition is forbidden to leading
order for two photons of identical frequencies [11], it is so
close to the magic wavelength that it has to be a priori
considered. The second one resonantly couples 5s5p 3P0
to 5s4f 3F2 at 818.57 nm and is fully allowed.

We report here an experimental study of higher order
eﬀects in a 87Sr optical lattice clock operating at a very
high trapping depth up to 1400 Er and for a linear polar-
ization of the lattice. This depth is about a factor of ten
higher than in the other reported systems [2, 3] which en-
hances the sensitivity to higher-order frequency shifts by
two orders of magnitude. At the maximum depth and for
a detuning of the lattice laser as small as 0.5 GHz from
the 3P0 → 1P1 transition, higher order frequency shifts
are below a few hertz. On the other hand, when the lat-
tice laser is tuned to within a few hundred MHz of the
3P0 → 3F2 transition, non-linear frequency shifts of sev-
eral kHz are observed. These results, together with mea-
surements at the magic wavelength, give a stringent limit

in optimal operating conditions. We show that higher
order frequency shifts will not limit the accuracy of a Sr
optical lattice clock down to the 10−18 level.

The high trapping depth is reached thanks to an en-
hancement Fabry-P´erot cavity around the 1D vertical lat-
tice. The circulating power reaches 16 W for a 650 mW
input at 813 nm. The mode has a waist radius of 90 µm
corresponding to a maximum U0 = 1400 Er and an ax-
ial (resp. radial) oscillation frequency of 260 kHz (resp.
540 Hz). An intracavity dichroic mirror separates the lat-
tice light from that which probes the clock transition. It
induces negligible intracavity loss at 813 nm while ensur-
ing that less than 10−3 of the incident power at 698 nm
is reﬂected back to the atoms by the cavity mirror. The
lattice polarization is interferometrically ﬁltered by an
intra-cavity quarter wave plate which lifts the degener-
acy between the linear polarization states parallel to the
eigen axis of the plate by half a free spectral range. The
resulting polarization of the trapping light is linear to
better than 10−3.
Its wavelength λL is controlled by
means of a wave meter with an accuracy of 10−3 nm.

Atoms are loaded into the optical lattice from the
magneto-optical trap (MOT) described in [12]. Through-
out the loading cycle the lattice is overlapped with the
MOT. Cold atoms at the center of the trap are selec-
tively optically pumped to the metastable 3P0,2 states
by means of two ”drain” lasers of waist radius 50 µm
that are aligned to the lattice. They are tuned to the
1S0 − 3P1 and 3P1 − 3S1 transitions at 689 and 688 nm
respectively (Fig. 1). Atoms in the metastable states re-
main trapped provided their energy is smaller than the
200 µK lattice depth. This leads to a continuous loading
of the lattice at a rate of about 105 atoms/s. After half
a second of loading time the MOT and drain lasers are
switched oﬀ, and the atoms are repumped back to the
ground state using two lasers tuned to the 3P0,2 − 3S1
transitions at 679 and 707 nm. They are then cooled in
the lattice to ∼ 10 µK in 50 ms with the narrow 1S0− 3P1
intercombination line at 689 nm [13].

Following this preparation stage we probe the 1S0 −
3P0 clock transition at 698 nm. The frequency of the
probe laser is referenced to an ultra-stable cavity as de-
scribed in Ref. [14]. The probe beam is aligned parallel
to the lattice and has a waist radius of 200 µm. Its polar-
ization is linear and parallel to the lattice polarization.
After the probe pulse, the transition probability to 3P0
is measured in a few ms by laser induced ﬂuorescence. A
ﬁrst detection pulse at 461 nm gives the number of atoms
remaining in the ground state and ejects these atoms
from the trap. Atoms in 3P0 are then repumped to the
ground state and detected similarly. This method allows
a transition probability measurement which is insensitive
to the atom number ﬂuctuations. The resonance is shown
in Fig. 2. The central feature (the carrier) is zoomed in
the inset of the ﬁgure. Its linewidth is 260 Hz in optimal
operating conditions: λL = λm, probe pulse of 10 ms

duration and 2 µW power. The resonance plotted here
was obtained at the maximum trapping depth and we
observed no clear dependence of its width and contrast
with U0.

The carrier is surrounded by motional sidebands
shifted by the oscillation frequency along the lattice di-
rection. They are hardly visible in optimal operation but
can be enhanced by applying long pulses of 200 ms du-
ration at the maximum available power (2 mW) of the
probe beam. The resulting spectrum is plotted in grey
in Fig. 2. The 1:5 ratio between the red and blue side-
bands show that 80% of the atoms populate the |nz = 0i
motional state along the lattice axis, corresponding to
a temperature of 8 µK. The transverse temperature is
10 µK.

The eﬀect of the trap on the clock transition is mea-
sured by locking the frequency of the probe laser to the
carrier for various values of U0 and λL. The trap depth
U0 is adjusted to its desired value between 200 Er and
1400 Er by a linear ramp of 1 ms duration between the
cooling and probing phases. This slightly decreases the
transverse temperature while the longitudinal motion is
adiabatically cooled by following the ramp. To lock the
probe laser frequency we alternatively probe both sides
of the resonance and compute an error signal from the
diﬀerence between two successive measurements of the
transition probability. This also gives a measurement of
the diﬀerence between the atomic transition and the ref-
erence cavity frequency which slowly ﬂuctuates due to
thermal eﬀects. These ﬂuctuations behave essentially as
a sine wave of peak to peak amplitude 300 Hz and pe-
riod 10 minutes. To derive the frequency shift due to the
lattice, we reject the cavity frequency ﬂuctuations by a
factor 100 by a diﬀerential method [15]. We interleave
measurements at 4 diﬀerent lattice depths. We run the

clock for 19 cycles before U0 is changed to the next of
the four interleaved values. The entire sequence is re-
peated typically 16 times. The cavity ﬂuctuations are
then modelled as a polynomial which is determined by a
least square ﬁt of the data [18]. The data are corrected for
the modelled cavity frequency ﬂuctuations and averaged.
This yields 4 statistically independent measurements [19]
of the clock transition frequency versus U0 with a stan-
dard deviation of about 5 Hz. A typical set of such points
is shown in Fig. 3(a).

We perform a quadratic least square ﬁt of each set
of four points which gives a measurement of the coeﬃ-
cients ν1 and ν2 of Eq.( 1). The coeﬃcient ν2 is plot-
ted in Fig. 3(c) and found compatible with zero for the
whole range [813.3 nm, 813.5 nm] to within a few tens of
µHz. A specially interesting wavelength region is around
813.36 nm where the 3P0 → 1P1 two-photon transition is

expected. The contribution of a two-photon transition to
ν2 varies as ∆−1, with ∆ the detuning of the lattice with
respect to the resonance. We magnify this contribution
by systematically spanning a frequency range of ±5 GHz
with a 1 GHz step around the expected value (Fig. 3(c)).
The null results of all these measurements demonstrate
that the higher order shift due to the 3P0 → 1P1 tran-
sition is less than 1 µHz/E2
r for λL = λm. Despite its
proximity to the magic wavelength, this two-photon tran-
sition is forbidden enough to not be a problem.

This set of experiments around 813.4 nm can also
be used to derive an accurate value of λm. Having
shown that ν2 is negligible for λL ∼ λm, better esti-
mates of ν1 are obtained with linear ﬁts of each set of
four points. They are plotted in Fig. 3(b). We ﬁnd
λm = 813.428(1) nm in agreement with previously pub-
lished values [2, 3] as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b). The
improvement by one order of the accuracy of this mea-
surement is a nice illustration of the ampliﬁcation of the
eﬀects of the lattice oﬀered by a deep trapping potential.
We also studied the eﬀect of the other two photon
transition in this wavelength region, the 3P0 → 3F2 at
818.57 nm. When tuned 5 nm away from λm we expect, in
addition to the eﬀect of the two-photon coupling, a trivial

quadratic dependence of the atomic frequency vs U0 due
to the imperfect cancellation of ν1 and to the inhomo-
geneity of the laser intensity experienced by the atoms.
We do observe a substantial broadening and asymmetry
of the resonance due to this eﬀect similar to what was re-
ported in Ref. [16]. The associated trivial quadratic fre-
quency shift amounts to 0.8 mHz/E2
r as measured several
GHz away on both sides of the two photon transition.

When tuned closer to the resonance, we clearly observe
the non-trivial quadratic frequency shift due to the two-
photon resonance itself. The eﬀect is shown in Fig. 4.
Quadratic frequency shifts of several kHz and changing
sign depending on the side of the transition being probed
are observed as shown in Fig. 4(b). This is a clear sig-
nature of the higher order eﬀects due to the particular
transition under investigation. When tuned exactly onto
one of the ﬁve transitions corresponding to the hyperﬁne
structure of 3F2, the lattice laser induces severe loss (up
to 90%) of atoms when the 698 nm probe laser is tuned
to resonance. This eﬀect, which we attribute to three-
photon ionization from 3P0, was used to determine the
position of the ﬁve hyperﬁne sub-states shown by arrows
in Fig. 4(a). The hyperﬁne structure of 3F2 leads to a
complex dependence of the quadratic frequency shift on
the lattice wavelength around resonance. The contribu-
tion of the ﬁve substates can interfere with each other,
which may be the cause of the oscillations of ν2 seen in
Fig. 4(a) on both sides of the hyperﬁne manifold. We can
deduce from our measurements a conservative estimate
of the contribution of the 3P0 − 3F2 resonance to the
higher order eﬀects at λL = λm. The grey dashed curved
plotted in Fig. 4(a) scales as the inverse of the detuning
of the lattice with respect to the center of gravity of the
hyperﬁne structure of 3F2 and envelopes experimental
points. When extrapolated to the magic wavelength, it
gives a contribution to ν2 of 2 µHz.

Finally we have performed an extensive series of mea-
surements of ν2 at λL = λm resulting in the data plot-
ted in Fig. 5. Their weighted average gives ν2(λm) =
7(6) µHz. For a lattice depth of 10 Er the frequency shift
is lower than 1 mHz (one sigma) or 2×10−18 in fractional
units. This demonstrates that the frequency shift due

4

to the atomic hyperpolarizability constitutes no impedi-
ment to the accuracy of a Sr optical lattice clock down to
the 10−18 level. In addition, the eﬀective laser intensity
seen by the atoms is certainly controllable at the percent
level [20]. The performance of the system would then be
immune to higher order frequency shifts over a broad lat-
tice depth range, possibly up to U0 = 100 Er. This would
provide a powerful lever for the experimental evaluation
at the 10−18 level of other eﬀects associated for instance
to the dynamics of the atoms in the lattice or to cold
collisions. Collisions are expected negligible with polar-
ized fermions, but they have to be considered if one uses
bosonic isotopes [4], such as 88Sr. By varying the trap-
ping depth, one can adjust the tunnelling rate and then
control the overlap of the wave functions of atoms con-
ﬁned in the lattice, allowing the study of cold collisions
in a new regime.

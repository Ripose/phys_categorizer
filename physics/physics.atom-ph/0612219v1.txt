We present a very eﬃcient technique for solving the three-dimensional time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation. Our method is applicable to a wide range of problems where a fullly three-dimensional
solution is required, i.e., to cases where no symmetries exist that reduce the dimensionally of the
problem. Examples include arbitrarily oriented molecules in external ﬁelds and atoms interacting
with elliptically polarized light. We demonstrate that even in such cases, the three-dimensional
problem can be decomposed exactly into two two-dimensional problems at the cost of introducing
a trivial rotation transformation. We supplement the theoretical framework with numerical results
on strong-ﬁeld ionization of arbitrarily oriented H2

+ molecules.

INTRODUCTION

In atomic physics the spherical symmetry of atoms
promotes the spherical coordinates to a special position.
The three independent variables are (r, θ, φ), with r the
radial distance of the electron with respect to the nu-
cleus, θ the polar angle and φ the azimuthal angle. The
Schr¨odinger equation for the hydrogen atom is separa-
ble in these coordinates with wave functions of the form
ψnlm(r) = Rnl(r)Ylm(θ, φ) separated into a radial wave
function Rnl(r) and a spherical harmonic Ylm(θ, φ). Fur-
thermore, conﬁgurations of this type with associated or-
bitals ψnlm(r) form the building blocks of Slater deter-
minants and consequently of mean ﬁeld approaches to
atomic structure. Even for molecules where the pres-
ence of multiple nuclei breaks the spherical symmetry
(
6= 0), single-centre expansions in spherical har-
monic basis has been used successfully [1].
(cid:2)

For a general problem involving a single active elec-
tron we are thus led to the consideration of the three-
dimensional time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation in
spherical coordinates and for the reduced wave function
(Φ = rΨ) we seek a solution of the form

A very important advantage of this representation is
that we can beneﬁt from angular momentum theory
when dealing with the angular degrees of freedom. An
outstanding problem, however, remains. The problem,
which is referred to as the m-mixing problem among com-
putational scientists, is that often couplings—external
or internal—are present that introduce a mixing of m’s
across l’s. Such m-mixings occur for example when an
atom is subject to an elliptically polarized ﬁeld or to a lin-
early polarized ﬁeld described beyond the dipole approx-
imation. When m is no longer conserved, the dynamics
aﬀects all three coordinates and a numerical simulation
is diﬃcult: three-dimensional calculations tend to be ex-

tremely time-consuming and computationally demand-
ing.

In the course of our recent work concerned with
alignment-dependent response of molecules to strong ex-
ternal ﬁelds we found a solution that speeds up the cal-
culation by the use of an exact mapping of the three-
dimensional problem to two two-dimensional problems.
In the following we discuss the method by the speciﬁc
example of the response of an arbitrarily oriented di-
atomic molecule to an external perturbation so strong
that the system is ionized. As will become clear, the cen-
tral ideas are completely general and carry over to the
related case of atoms in elliptically polarized ﬁelds, poly-
atomic molecules as well as m-problems in geology and
astronomy where expansions in spherical harmonics are
also often encountered.

The paper is organized as follows:

II. BASIC IDEAS AND PRINCIPLES

We illustrate the basic ideas and principles of the
method by discussing the speciﬁc example of a linear di-
atomic molecules in an external electromagnetic ﬁeld. In
Fig. 1 we show the coordinate systems which are rel-
evant for the ﬁeld-molecule problem. The coordinates
(xL, yL, zL) specify the laboratory (L) ﬁxed coordinate
system deﬁned by the external polarization vector. We
assume that the ﬁeld is linearly polarized and return to
the generalization to elliptically polarized light in Sec. IV.
The coordinate system denoted by superscripts M is the
molecular ﬁxed frame and is rotated by the Euler angles
(α, β, γ) with respect to the laboratory ﬁxed system. The
rotation is accomplished by an α rotation around the zL-
axis, followed by a β rotation around the yM -axis, and
ﬁnally a γ rotation around the zM -axis. For the case

FIG. 1: The orientation of the molecular coordinate system
(M , dashed) with respect to the laboratory ﬁxed system (L,
solid). In the ﬁgure only the Euler angles α, β are nonvanish-
ing.

considered the only really distinct geometries are associ-
ated with the angle β. Results for diﬀerent orientations
due to the angle α are trivially related by a simple rota-
tion around the zL axis. Also the γ rotations around the
molecular axis are insigniﬁcant as a consequence of the
axial symmetry of the molecule.

We want to determine how the wave function of an
electron is aﬀected by the operators V (M) and V (I)(t),
corresponding to the interaction with the nuclei and the
ﬁeld, respectively. We assume that we can treat these two
operators separately, which is the case in a split-operator
approach as described in Sec. III below. Our strategy
is ﬁrst to represent the wave function in the molecular
frame and calculate the action of V (M). Secondly, we
transform the updated wave function to the laboratory
ﬁxed frame and apply the operator V (I). Finally we can
return to the molecular frame by the inverse rotation.
These forward (β) and backward (−β) rotations of the
wave function are illustrated in Fig. 2. The active inter-
action (V (M) or V (I)) is marked by black and the inactive
operation is gray. This propagation scheme for arbitrary
orientation of the polarization axis with respect to the
internuclear axis, exhibits the strength of the present ap-
proach since it allows us to perform the calculations very
eﬃciently. Whenever we apply an axially symmetric op-
erator, we do not mix diﬀerent m states provided that the
wave function is expressed in the proper reference frame.
Thus we can apply the operator separately on each diﬀer-
ent m state. The decoupling of diﬀerent m states means
eﬀectively that we have reduced the three-dimensional
problem to a number of two-dimensional problems in ad-
dition to two rotation operations.

The rotation transformation is in principle possible in
all sets of coordinates and the separation in m applies
to any coordinate system where the azimuthal angle φ
is an independent variable, e.g. cylindrical, parabolic, or
spheroidal coordinates. The two unique features of the

in the xz plane. The double headed arrow shows the direction
of the laser polarization vector. In (a) we calculate the action
of the molecular potential and express the wave function in
the molecular frame with the internuclear axis parallel to the
z axis. In panel (b) we transform the wave function to the
laboratory ﬁxed system with the laser polarization parallel to
the z axis in order to propagate by the ﬁeld interaction. The
transformation between the two frames is represented by the
rotation operator D.

tion matrix contains Wigner rotation functions which are
known analytically and (ii) the transformation is guaran-
teed to be exactly unitary for functions that are band-
width limited by a maximum l = lmax, i.e., the popula-
tion in states with l > lmax is zero.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In the present work, we solve the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) for the electronic motion
+ in the presence of a time-dependent electromag-
in H2
netic ﬁeld. We represent the angular variables in a basis
of spherical harmonics and write the reduced wave func-
tion as in Eq. (1). The radial functions flm which contain
the time dependence are discretized on an equidistant
spatial mesh. The expansion in spherical harmonics is
truncated such that l ≤ lmax leading to a total number
of (lmax + 1)2 angular basis functions. The reduced wave
function satisﬁes the TDSE with the Hamiltonian [atomic
units (~ = |e| = me = a0 = 1) are used throughout]

The error in the propagation scheme above is approxi-
mately cubic in τ and occurs mainly due to the split-
ting of non-commuting operators. A related propagation
scheme was applied in geometries with azimuthal sym-
metry [2], and the propagation techniques used for the
kinetic operators Tr and Tl are readily extended to our
fully three-dimensional problem. We will therefore turn
to the new propagation method of the molecular poten-
tial and the ﬁeld interaction.

We describe the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the dipole ap-

proximation by the vector potential

A(t) = ˆeA0(t) cos(ωt),

(4)

where A0(t) is the envelope function, ω the frequency and

ˆe the polarization direction. The electric ﬁeld is obtained
as F (t) = −dA(t)/dt. The operator V in Eq. (2) is writ-
ten as the sum of the ﬁeld interaction and the molecular
potential

V (t) = V (I)

r,θL(t) + V (M)

where the subscripts denote the variables on which the
operators act. θM is the polar angle in the molecular
frame [Fig. 2 (a)] and θL the polar angle in the labora-
tory ﬁxed system [Fig. 2 (b)]. The molecular operator is
diagonal in coordinate space

V (M)
r,θL = V (M)(r, θL),

the length- (LG) or the velocity gauge (VG) as

Although not essential for our present discussion, we note
that for inversion symmetric potentials as in the case of
+, a further block diagonalization in even and odd
H2
parity blocks can be obtained. From the block diagonal
structure of the matrix representation, it is clear that the
propagation can be accomplished separately within each
m subspace, and the full three-dimensional propagation
eﬀectively reduces to independent two-dimensional prop-
agations, which can be solved by matrix multiplications
on each m block. There is a total number of 2lmax + 1
individual m blocks with dimensionality between 1 and
lmax + 1.

After having applied the molecular potential we trans-
form the wave function to the laboratory ﬁxed frame.
We relate the expansion in spherical harmonics in dif-
ferent frames by representation of the rotation operator
in spherical harmonics, i.e., the Wigner rotation matrix
D(α, β, γ). The laboratory ﬁxed expansion coeﬃcients
are then obtained as f (L)(ri, t) = D(α, β, γ) · f (M)(ri, t).
We note that this matrix multiplication is very fast since
the rotation does not mix diﬀerent l’s and D(α, β, γ) is

consequently sparse. Also note that the rotation opera-
tion is independent of the radial coordinate and we can
therefore use the same rotation operation on all the vec-
tors (9) for diﬀerent r’s.

Having obtained the wave function in the laboratory
ﬁxed frame, we can easily apply the ﬁeld interaction op-
erator. Again, without m-couplings, the individual two-
dimensional problems can be solved straightforwardly [3].
Finally we return to the molecular frame by the inverse
transformation f (M)(ri, t) = D†(α, β, γ) · f (L)(ri, t).

an alternative three-dimensional approach where we in a
single step treat the total V and mix between all (lmax +
1)2 angular basis states, the computational complexity
scales as O(l4
max) [4]. Our present method, on the other
hand, scales more favourably as O(l2.7
max). In numerical
simulations for typical bandwidths of lmax ∼ 15 − 39, we
have checked that both three-dimensional methods agree
in their predictions but with a great speed-up of the order
of a factor of 100 − 500 in favor of the new method.

Ionization of H2

+

We calculate the ionization probability for H2

+ in-
duced by a strong infra-red light source. The two pro-
tons are ﬁxed at the equilibrium internuclear distance of
2 a.u.. The ﬁeld is taken to be linearly polarized with fre-
quency ω = 0.057 a.u. (λ = 800 nm), and peak intensity
5 × 1014 W/cm2. We use a sine-square envelope func-
tion that encloses seven optical cycles, corresponding to
a total pulse duration of 19 fs. Convergent results are
obtained with lmax = 23 and 1024 radial grid points ex-
tending to a box size of 150 a.u.. In order to avoid re-
ﬂections at the edge of the box, we impose an absorbing
boundary. The time step size is τ = 5 × 10−3 a.u.. We
choose the velocity gauge form of the interaction since it
is superior to the length gauge in producing converged
results for dynamical problems [5, 6].

First we calculate the angular diﬀerential ionization
probability. For that purpose we need the gauge invariant
current density

J(r, t) = Re [Ψ∗(r, t) (p + A(t)) Ψ(r, t)] ,

(12)

where p = −i∇ is the canonical momentum. We relate
the outgoing radial probability ﬂux at some large dis-
tance R to the diﬀerential ionization probability in the
laboratory ﬁxed frame

We must of course choose R to be smaller than the ra-
dial distance at which we turn on the absorbing potential.
Figure 3 shows the angular diﬀerential probabilities for
the alignment angles 0◦, 45◦, and 90◦. In all cases, the
electron escapes exclusively in a very narrow cone along

the polarization direction. These results are in accor-
dance with expectations from the quasistatic tunneling
picture. The ionization dynamics is often considered as
being tunneling-like for strong, low frequency ﬁelds where
the Keldysh parameter fullﬁls γ < 1 [7]. In the present
case γ = 0.7 at the peak intensity. In the tunneling pic-
ture the electron is assumed to escape near the ﬁeld di-
rection since the barrier has its shortest spatial extension
in that direction [8].

The most notable diﬀerence between panels (a)-(c) is
the overall scaling of the distribution which decreases
with increasing angle between the polarization and in-
ternuclear axes. We can qualitatively explain this ob-
servation by the associated decrease in electronic charge
density of the intial σg-orbital after the polarization di-
rection (see countour plot in Fig. 2). The same reason-
ing carries over to the behavior of the total alignment
dependent ionization probabilities shown in Fig. 4. The
results in this ﬁgure can be obtained by integrating the
diﬀerential ionization probability Eq. (13) over all direc-
tions. Alternatively, we may project out the bound state
components of the ﬁnal wave function. For comparison,
Fig. 4 also contains the results from Ref. [6] which were
obtained by a ﬁeld of the same frequency and peak inten-
sity but with a slightly diﬀerent pulse shape (trapezoidal)
and longer duration. We ﬁnd somewhat lower ionization
probabilities than in Ref. [6] since our pulse is at the peak
intensity for a shorter duration of time. Although the
two data series are not directly comparable, the overall
behaviour is similar, namely decreasing ionization prob-
ability with increasing alignment angle from parallel (0◦)
to perpendicular (90◦).

IV. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

In conclusion, we have developed a new approach that
accurately and eﬃciently resolves the m-mixing prob-
lem in large scale computations in a spherical coordinate
system. The method relies on an identiﬁcation of ro-
tations in the intermediate propagation that brings the
wave function into a frame of reference in which m is
conserved. This means that time-consuming m-mixing
induced by the external perturbation is avoided and in-
stead delegated to the rotations which are very eﬃciently

5

implemented using the Wigner rotation matrix represen-
tation of the rotation operator in the spherical harmonics
basis.

We have chosen the linear molecule interacting with
a linearly polarized ﬁeld to illustrate our method, but a
similar approach can be used in a much broader range of
three-dimensional problems. For example we could con-
sider an elliptically polarized ﬁeld. In the split operator
method we take the time step τ to be small enough such
that the ﬁeld can be taken to be constant both in mag-
nitude and polarization direction within the small time
interval. We can therefore consider a time-dependent
laboratory frame which follows the instantaneous polar-
ization direction.
If we make the transformation from
the molecular frame to the new laboratory frame, we are
again able to treat the ﬁeld as being linear and propagate
as discussed above. Our method can also be extended to
arbitrary nuclear positions. For any nuclear conﬁgura-
tion, we can attach a coordinate system to each nucleus
with a z axis from the origin to the nucleus. Then we de-
compose the molecular potential to a sum of nuclear po-
tentials, each of which can be propagated with azimuthal
symmetry in their own reference frame. Despite the fact
that we now need rotations between the coordinate sys-
tems belonging to all of the nuclei, the total calculation is
still in the same complexity class with respect to scaling
in lmax.

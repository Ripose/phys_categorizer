Abstract

The multiphoton ionization and photoelectron spectra of magnesium were
−2 using 150 fs laser pulses
studied at laser intensities of up to 6 × 1013 Wcm
of a wavelength of 400 nm. The results indicated that a variety of diﬀerent
ionization mechanisms played a role in both types of spectra. A theoretical
model describing the processes is presented and the routes to ionization are
identiﬁed. The work demonstrates the signiﬁcance of the two–electron nature
of the atom in interpreting the experimental results.

I. INTRODUCTION

The behavior of atoms in intense electro-magnetic ﬁelds has been under investigation
since the advent of the laser. Especially since the development of short–pulse, high–intensity
systems, experiments have revealed a multitude of novel eﬀects such as multiphoton ioniza-
tion (MPI) [1], above threshold ionization (ATI) [2], harmonic generation [3,4] etc. Most of
the theoretical models originally proposed to describe the observations involved essentially
a single electron interacting with the electromagnetic ﬁeld. This approximation has led to
signiﬁcant understanding of the atomic behavior in the ﬁeld. However, the multi-electron
nature of most atoms can play a signiﬁcant role under certain circumstances. Theory then
has to take into account multi–electron excitation, correlations between the electrons, mul-
tiple continua, i.e. the detailed atomic structure in order to be able to predict the atomic
behavior. This fact emerges as both theoretical and experimental techniques become more
advanced, enabling the exploration of new regimes and the detailed testing of theoretical
models.

In multi-electron atoms, signiﬁcant double excitation can take place leaving the ion not
in the ionic ground state but in an excited state or possibly ejecting a second electron.
In the alkaline earth atoms for example, the existence of doubly excited-state manifolds
between the two ionic thresholds alters drastically the single-electron picture rendering it
unsuitable. The conditions under which these eﬀects may occur are easily within reach
of present experimental setups. Past work by Dalwoo Kim et al [5], DiMauro et al [6]
and van Druten et al [7] has looked into the multiphoton ionization of magnesium with
nanosecond and picosecond laser pulse durations and indicated the importance of short
pulse experiments in understanding the processes involved. At the same time, theoretical
methods incorporating these eﬀects are also being developed [8,9], creating the need for
further experimental investigations.

In the present work we seek to investigate the extent to which electron correlations play a
role in the high intensity regime for multi-electron atoms. We chose magnesium, a fairly low
atomic weight alkaline earth element, as it is accessible to both experimental and theoretical
investigation. We report measurements of the multiphoton single and double ionization and
ATI of magnesium using 150 fs, 400 nm laser pulses. A theoretical model has been developed
and applied which describes the processes leading to ionization and shows that the inclusion
of one and two-electron eﬀects are necessary for an accurate description. Measurements of
the multiphoton ionization yield displayed the expected perturbative behavior for the pro-
duction of the Mg+ ion but showed unexpected features in the double ionization yield. The
ATI electron spectra also exhibited complex structure, originating from a variety of single
and double ionization mechanisms, whose relative importance changes as the intensity is
varied. The theoretical treatment involved both a perturbation theory description including
all correlation eﬀects between the active electrons and additionally, for the ionization of
Mg+, a non-perturbative approach.

II. METHOD

A. Experimental set-up

A plan of the experimental set-up is shown in ﬁgure 1. The laser employed consists
of a titanium sapphire oscillator ampliﬁed in a regenerative ampliﬁer utilizing a chirped
pulse ampliﬁcation technique [10]. The laser operates at 1 kHz repetition rate, with a
measured pulse duration of ≈150 fs at a wavelength of ≈798 nm. The second harmonic of
this beam was then produced using a focused geometry in a 250 µm thick BBO crystal. The
harmonic radiation was separated from the co-propagating fundamental by employing three
dichroic mirrors that were transparent to the fundamental (denoted by M2ω in ﬁgure 1). The
harmonic generation eﬃciency of this setup was ≈10%. The laser energy of the fundamental
was set to be less than 300 µJ, thus producing a maximum of ≈30 µJ of second harmonic
radiation.

The resulting harmonic laser beam was focused in a time–of–ﬂight spectrometer (TOF)
by a MgF lens of 15 cm focal length. A half–wave plate was positioned prior to that in
order to align the polarization of the light with the TOF tube axis. Under the conditions
of the experiment, the lens did not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the beam either in terms of non-
linear absorption or by pulse-front curvature at the focus [11]. The energy measurement
was achieved with a fast vacuum photodiode which was cross-calibrated with an average
power meter.

The time–of–ﬂight spectrometer, which has a ﬁeld–free ﬂight tube of 15 cm oriented
perpendicular to the laser propagation axis, is equipped with a µ-metal magnetic shield.
This shield, in combination with a repeller plate and the appropriate polarity of the charged
particle detector, allowed the use of the instrument alternately as an electron spectrometer
and as an ion time–of–ﬂight system. For the electron energy measurements the repeller was
grounded, whereas for the operation of the TOF as a mass spectrometer the repeller was
charged with a voltage of up to +1000 V. The charged particle detector at the end of the
ﬂight tube was a double micro–channel plate in a chevron conﬁguration. Its front side was
grounded for detecting electrons and at a negative voltage for ions.

An oven was inserted at the top of the interaction chamber ﬁlled with magnesium pellets
which, when heated, produced an atomic beam as the vapor exited an aperture. The atomic
beam met the laser beam and the time–of–ﬂight tube at right angles.

The acquisition system was essentially the same for both electron and ion detection. The
signal from the micro–channel plates ﬁrst went through a fast ampliﬁer and a discriminator.
Subsequently, its time of arrival with respect to the laser pulse was recorded by a multiple–
event time–digitizer card which was installed in a personal computer. The main feature of
this card was that it could acquire and time one event per 0.5 ns time–bin with no dead–
time between bins. Combined with the bandwidth of the cabling and electronic processing
stages, the eﬀective time resolution of the system was approximately one nanosecond. This
acquisition system was not sensitive to the amplitude of the signal and hence it was operated
in the event–counting regime. This meant that the number of events in each bin had to be
less than one per laser pulse, a condition which was ensured throughout the measurement.
At the higher laser intensities, for which the counting method was no longer appropriate
due to the increased ionization rates, the analogue signal was obtained directly from the
micro-channel plates and recorded on a digital oscilloscope. For the ion yield versus laser
intensity spectra, where data were recorded using both methods of acquisition, the data

3

were matched at several points in an intermediate regime. They were further cross-checked
with data from the less abundant isotopes of magnesium which would be still in the counting
regime at intensities for which the main peak was not. Lastly, to ensure that no space–charge
eﬀects were distorting the data, measurements were taken at diﬀerent oven temperatures
(and consequently atomic number densities) and compared. No rigorous absolute energy
calibration of the electron spectrometer was performed. The calibration of the energy scale
was based on the expected inter-peak separation of the several ATI peaks. This resulted
in a determination of the relative peak positions to better than 0.1 eV, although the de-
termination of the absolute peak positions was hindered by uncertainty in the zero time.
Comparison to data with xenon was consistent with the magnesium results in so far as the
energy calibration of the spectra was concerned, conﬁrming the validity of the calibration.
Xenon was also used to estimate the intensity of the laser at the interaction region [12–14]
and compare it with the number obtained by estimating the focal spot size.

B. Theoretical modeling

We now propose a theory to describe the experimental results and explain most of the
essential features. Magnesium in the present context is a rather complicated system since
it involves many coupled states and diﬀerent ionization channels. However, in that case,
we were able to identify and isolate atomic states and transitions connected to the leading
processes. These elements are summarized in ﬁgure 2. We consider that the electrons mea-
sured in the experiment are produced by 4 diﬀerent processes. Two lead to the production
of Mg+ (single ionization to the ground state Mg+(3s) by absorption of 3 photons or to the
ﬁrst exited state Mg+(3p) by absorption of 4 photons) and are labeled process (1) and (2)
respectively. Two other processes sequentially double ionize the system from the ion Mg+.
Mg++ is thus produced by absorption of 4 photons from Mg+(3p) or by absorption of 5
photons from Mg+(3s). The basic assumption in the theoretical approach is that double
ionization is produced through a sequential process. Therefore, double ionization through
direct (coherent) absorption of 8 photons (see path (5) in ﬁgure 2) is neglected. Under these
conditions, the population of each species is obtained by solving the following rate equations:

˙N3s2 = −(Γ(3)
˙N3s = Γ(3)
˙N3p = Γ(4)

3s2→3sk1 + Γ(4)
3s2→ 3sk1 N3s2 − Γ(5)
3s2→ 3pk2 N3s2 − Γ(4)

3sk1→k4k1 N3s
3pk2→k3k2 N3p

3s2→3pk2) N3s2

(1)

with the initial conditions N3s2(t = −∞) = 1 and all other populations set to zero. N3s2,
N3s and N3p represent the time-dependent populations of Mg(3s2), Mg+(3s) and Mg+(3p)
respectively. The time-dependent width Γ(p)
3ln1→n2n3 refers to the p-photon transition from the
initial state 3ln1 to the ﬁnal state n2n3. When the speciﬁcation of the angular momentum has
been removed from the state notation (like in n2n3), the width includes the contribution from
each accessible symmetry. kn refers to the momentum of the electron ejected through the
process labeled (n) in ﬁgure 2. The electron energies (reported in table I) are deduced from
the energy conservation principle excluding laser induced level shifts. The atomic structure
calculations providing the atomic energy levels and the transition cross-sections have been

4

described in detail in a precedent paper [15]. The energies and wave-functions are computed
using a frozen-core conﬁguration interaction (CI) procedure. The core Mg++(1s22s22p6)
(where electrons are assumed “frozen”) is represented by a self-consistent-ﬁeld wave function.
The core potential (including a dielectronic polarization term) is ﬁrst used to determine
Mg+ orbitals. We then compute two-electron wave-functions by diagonalizing the 2-electron
Hamiltonian in a basis of Mg+ orbitals conﬁgurations. The multiphoton ionization rates
Γ(p)
3s2→3lk and Γ(p)
3lk→k′k are calculated within lowest order perturbation theory [16] (for the
calculation of MPI matrix elements see also [17] and references therein). The rates leading
to double ionization from Mg+ are deduced from non-perturbative ATI calculations [18] (see
below) and are in agreement with the perturbative results. The spatio-temporal dependence
of the laser is accounted in this model by assuming the following ﬁeld envelope:

I(r, t) = Imax

1

(cosh(1.76 t

τ ))2 e−(4 ln 2(

r
κ )2)

(2)

where we assume a cylindrical symmetry (r, z) for the space macro dependence of the in-
tensity. κ and τ are respectively the spatial and temporal full width at half maximum
(FWHM).

Besides the perturbative evaluations of

ionization rates, we have performed non-
perturbative calculations of ionization from Mg+(3s) and Mg+(3p) by numerically solving
the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) [18]. A pseudo-potential [19] is used to
model the Mg+ ionic potential. The total wave-function is expanded in terms of spherical
harmonics and radial B-spline functions. The total Hamiltonian is then propagated in time
and the electron spectrum is calculated at the end of the pulse. This approach has the
advantage of neglecting none of the couplings. It therefore accounts for all dynamical level
shifts and possibly resonant transitions. These latter eﬀects are of importance to interpret
some of the experimental results as it is discussed below.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND COMPARISON WITH THEORY

A. Ion Yields

Figure 3 shows a typical time–of–ﬂight ion mass spectrum obtained in the experiment,
in logarithmic scale. The two charge states of magnesium (Mg+ and Mg++) are evident,
each displaying peaks corresponding to its three dominant isotopes. The isotope ratios are
as expected and no presence of impurities is detected. By integrating under the main peaks
of such spectra obtained for diﬀerent laser energies, the ion yield curves of singly and doubly
ionized magnesium were obtained.

The resulting ion yield curves are shown in ﬁgure 4. The theoretical curves (given by
solving equation 1 and denoted by the solid lines) agree very well with experimental values
over most of the range investigated. Small discrepancies in the heavily saturated region
−2 are expected since the detection volume was diﬀerent to the inter-
above 2 × 1013 W cm
action volume. The precise experimental intensity was determined by the agreement with
the theoretical curves. However, some uncertainty to this estimate can be expected due to
the fact that the macro-dependence of the ﬁeld envelope assumed in the theory strongly

5

aﬀects the ion yield behavior, especially in the saturated region, sometimes even aﬀecting
the apparent saturation intensity. The theoretical rate for three photon ionization of Mg
−2). The corresponding
is Γ(3)
3s2→3sk1 = 0.45 × 106 ( I
I0 )3 a.u. (where I0 = 6.44 × 1015 W cm
3s2→3sk1 = 0.85 × 10−80 cm6 sec2
generalized cross-section σ(3)
is in agreement with the values
calculated by Chang and Tang [20]. One can easily calculate that single ionization satu-
rates at about I = 5 × 1012 W cm2
for a pulse duration of 150 fs, in agreement with the
experimental ion yield shown in ﬁgure 4.

In the lower energy range of the ﬁgure (around I = 4×1012 W cm

−2) a clear enhancement
to the Mg++ yield relative to what expected from the theoretical results can be seen. This
enhancement seems to level oﬀ, the experimental curve tending back to the theoretical one,
at the onset of saturation of single ionization. This may be an indication that two–electron
ejection is connected to the population of the atomic ground state which would be the case
for e.g. non-sequential double ionization. It should be noted that the Keldysh or adiabaticity
parameter [21] γ = qIp/(2Up) (where Ip is the ionization potential of the atom and Up ≈
−2)λ2(µm) is the ponderomotive energy of a free electron in a laser ﬁeld
9.33 × 10−14I(W cm
of wavelength λ and intensity I) is not favorable to observe tunneling, rescattering or shake-
oﬀ eﬀects (γ = 2 at the highest intensity). It is therefore possible that the enhancement is
related to atomic structure, or to dynamical shifts leading to either resonances or channel
closing as it is discussed in section III B 1.

B. Electron results

A typical electron energy spectrum is shown in ﬁgure 5. The spectrum displays a set
of main ATI peaks, each accompanied by a pronounced side peak (at approximately 1.3 eV
to its low energy side). While the main ATI peak can safely be attributed to three-photon
ionization of neutral magnesium leading to the ion Mg+(3s), the origin of the side peak is
not so clear without further investigation. Note that the main peaks in ﬁgure 5 are oﬀset
compared to the expected energies corresponding to normal perturbation theory. This is an
experimental artifact due to the lack of absolute energy calibration of the TOF as it is not
relevant to the present investigation (see also section II A).

Table I gives the calculated energy of the ejected electrons upon ionization through
the diﬀerent processes depicted in ﬁgure 2. Comparing these with the electron spectra of
ﬁgure 5 suggests two possible mechanisms that would result in the side peak in the recorded
data: (i) 4–photon ionization of Mg leading to the Mg+(3p) threshold, i.e. the ﬁrst excited
state of the magnesium ion (process (2) in table I). That would give an energy diﬀerence
between the main and side peak of (1.656 − 0.34) = 1.316 eV, (ii) 5–photon ionization of
Mg+(3s) leading to the 2p6 ground state of Mg++ ((4) in table I), which would give an
energy diﬀerence of (1.656 − 0.47) = 1.186 eV. Both of these candidates are within the
experimental uncertainty and the electron peak widths, especially at the higher intensities.
Note that direct double ionization (process (5) in table I) would give a continuous electron
distribution with maximum energy of 2.13 eV, as that energy is shared between the two
electrons.

1. Electron shifts

Careful analysis of the electron spectra can give more insight into the mechanisms in-
volved. Figure 6 shows a detail of the ATI spectra of ﬁgure 5 with additional plots for
diﬀerent intensities. If one concentrates just on the peak positions one notices that the main
peak shifts smoothly up to a point and then stops completely. In contrast, the side peak
initially shifts, then stops and ﬁnally starts shifting again. This behavior is shown clearly
in ﬁgure 7 where the positions of two electron peaks are plotted versus laser intensity. The
square points correspond to the main peak while the circles to the side peak.

The main peak originates from the processes (1) and (3) shown in ﬁgure 2. Our calcu-
lations show that, in all cases, the contribution from process (1) (three-photon ionization
leading to a Mg+(3s) ion) dominates over (3). Indeed, this latter process originates from
Mg+(3p), whose production from Mg(3s2) requires the absorption of 4 photons in contrast
to the 3 photons involved in process (1). The ﬂattening can be explained in terms of the
ion production saturating [12,13]. As the intensity increases, there comes a point where, in
eﬀect, the atom will ionize before the end of the laser pulse, and so it will not experience the
full power of the laser. Therefore the curve levels out. To account for the speciﬁc, detailed
behavior one has to take into account all the factors that would contribute to the shift, e.g.
(i) ponderomotive shifts and (ii) AC Stark shifts.

The lower data points in ﬁgure 7 (corresponding to the side peak) have a diﬀerent be-
havior, which cannot be explained solely by saturation. The two diﬀerent trends observable
in the energy shift indicate that more than one process is at work. As can be seen from the
theoretical calculations in ﬁgure 8(a) and (b), the side peak is a (unresolved in our data)
combination of two processes, one coming from single ionization (2) the other from double
sequential ionization (4) (see ﬁgure 2). At low intensity (ﬁgure 8(a)), the calculations show
that the side peak is dominated by single ionization (2). At about I = 1.8 × 1013 W cm−2,
processes (2) and (4) have an equal contribution, but for higher intensities the process (4)
largely dominates over (2) (ﬁgure 8(b)). Figure 8(c) and (d) indicates the development of
In fact, as we will see below,
the relevant atomic populations as the laser pulse evolves.
the process (2) should have a signiﬁcantly smaller contribution for intensities larger than
−2. The electron production originating from the decay to the ﬁrst excited
I = 8×1012 W cm
ionic state would saturate at the same intensity as the electrons of the main peak, in agree-
ment with the ﬁrst trend observed in the data. On the other hand, the electrons originating
from sequential double ionization (4) are expected to saturate at higher intensities. As the
intensity increases, this second process dominates in the side peak, and the change of slope
observed after the initial leveling oﬀ is due to the shift experienced by this second diﬀerent
peak. This latter shift is shown in ﬁgure 9 where we plot the energy shift of electrons orig-
inating from process (4) versus the intensity. This graph results from a non-perturbative
calculation which includes both AC Stark shift and ponderomotive shift. Note that the shift
is not uniquely due to the ponderomotive eﬀect as is often the case in ATI measurements.
This is shown in ﬁgure 9 where we detail the contribution of the ponderomotive shift to the
total shift. It should be noted that the experimental shifts appear to have a smaller magni-
tude than the theoretical ones, indicating a smaller experimental intensity than previously
extracted from the ion yields. However, considering that the acquisition of the electron
signal takes place under diﬀerent conditions to that of the ion signal (ﬁeld-free, as opposed

7

to a high applied voltage for the ion extraction), it is extremely likely that the extraction
region, and therefore the eﬀective intensity seen by each species could well be diﬀerent. The
uncertainty in the determination of the intensity in the ion yields should also be taken into
account, as described in a previous section.

Our calculations show that, for intensities larger than 1013 W cm

−2, the double ionization
is dominated by the process (1+4) (see ﬁgure 2). At lower intensities, the channel (2+3)
has a signiﬁcant contribution to the production of Mg++. As already mentioned, the double
ionization yield displays a signiﬁcant deviation at low intensities. We considered the laser
induced energy shift of the Rydberg series Mg(3pnl) (converging, as n → ∞, to the sum
of the AC Stark shift of Mg+(3p) and the ponderomotive shift Up) and the AC Stark shift
−2,
of Mg(3s2). Through this we found that, for intensities larger than 8 × 1012 W cm
the 4-photon ionization channel (2) is closed and ionization to Mg+(3p) now requires the
absorption of 5 photons. The eﬀect is that the experimental double ionization yield deviates
−2. Note that the single ionization
from the normal picture at about I = 8 × 1012 W cm
channel, dominated by the process (1), is almost not aﬀected by this eﬀect. Nevertheless,
we see in ﬁgure 4 that the theoretical Mg++ yield lies below the experimental curve in
the low intensity region. According to the previous considerations, it should ﬁt the Mg++
−2 (in the rate
experimental yield at low intensity and overestimate it for I > 8 × 1012 W cm
equation system (1), 4-photon ionization of Mg to Mg+(3p) is allowed at all intensities).
Thus the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results in the latter region still
remains to be explained. Other eﬀects, like direct and/or sequential ionization (eventually
involving higher thresholds) enhanced by the presence of resonances, should be explored.
Consequently, the sequential model adopted here for double ionization may not be valid at
low intensities, where further experimental and theoretical eﬀorts may be required in order
to complete the present analysis.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The results presented in this paper are some of the very few works studying in both
experimental and theoretical detail the MPI and ATI spectra of an alkaline earth using ultra–
short pulses. The work demonstrates clearly the signiﬁcance of the two–electron nature of
the atom in these spectra, both in terms of the role of the electron correlations, and with
respect to the precise level structure of both the atom and the ion.

The attribution of the pronounced sets of side peaks, accompanying the usual ATI spec-
trum, was not trivial, and required a theoretical investigation taking into account all of the
above factors in order to explain their origin. As it turned out, more than one processes
contributed to their appearance, each dominating at a diﬀerent range of intensities. Most
notably, one of the two dominant processes at low intensity was the decay to the ﬁrst excited
electronic state of the ion, a pathway which involves the excitation of both valence electrons
and coupled ionization channels. However, the prominence of this process was diminished
as the intensity increased due to the depletion of the ground atomic state, and overtaken
by the electron originating from sequential double ionization from the ground state of the
atom. In principle, another new peak should arise due to sequential double ionization from
the excited ionic state, but the position of this was calculated to be too close to the main

8

structure (three-photon ionization of Mg) to allow for its observation. It might be useful to
conduct an extension of this study to a diﬀerent photon energy, at the moment not available
in our laboratory, at which these proximities are avoided, and at which the peaks from each
of the processes are well resolved.

The detailed studying of the electron energy shifts of both the main and the side set
of peaks also pointed to the importance of the factors mentioned above. Quite apart from
their being used as a tool towards the identiﬁcation of the side peak, the shifts displayed a
behavior not suﬃciently explained by the common analysis in terms of ponderomotive shifts.
Due to the complex level structure of both the atom and the ion, with transitions close to
resonance with the laser ﬁeld, AC Stark shifts were found to play an important role and could
no longer be ignored. The multiphoton ionization yields, despite the relatively low intensities
employed, also display an interesting enhancement of double ionization which deviates from
the normal picture. We have found that, due to AC and ponderomotive shifts, the channel
−2. This
(2) requires the absorption of 5 photons for intensities larger than 8 × 1012W cm
is a possible explanation for the enhancement of double photon ionization, but other eﬀects
should be explored, in particular the possibility of near-resonant enhancement or, more
tentatively, direct double ionization, possibly enhanced by electron correlations and presence
of multiple doubly excited manifolds.

All of the above indicate that a full picture of the atom needs to be explicitly contained in
any investigation attempting to elucidate the high-intensity behavior of two electron atoms,
and possibly other atoms as well.

cases (a) and (b) as the laser pulse evolves. (solid line): Laser intensity normalized to the maximum
intensity; (dashed line): ground state of the atom Mg(3s2) (short-dash line): ground state of the
ion Mg+(3s) produced by three-photon ionization from Mg(3s2) along with electron of energy E1;
(dotted line): ﬁrst excited state of the ion Mg+(3p) produced by four-photon ionization from
Mg(3s2) along with electron of energy E2; (dash-dot-dot line): doubly ionized Mg++(2p6) through
four-photon ionization of Mg+(3p) along with electron of energy E3; (dash-dot line): doubly ionized

FIG. 9. Total shift (solid line) in energy of electrons originating from process (4), resulting
from a non-perturbative calculation of the ionization of Mg+(3s). Also shown (dashed line) is the
contribution to the total due to the Mg+(3s) AC stark shift.

TABLE I. Table of the energies of the diﬀerent ionic thresholds in which the ionization may
leave the Mg atoms, the number of 3.1 eV photons that need to be absorbed to reach each of
these (N ph) and the energy of the ejected electron upon ionization (Eel)(All numbers refer to ﬁeld
free energies, with energy shifts not taken into account). The various processes are illustrated in
ﬁgure 2.

Relativistic tunnel ionization of atoms by intense, elliptically polarized light is considered. The
relativistic version of the Landau-Dykhne formula is employed. The general analytical expression is
obtained for the relativistic photoelectron spectra. The most probable angle of electron emission,
the angular distribution near this angle, the position of the maximum and the width of the energy
spectrum are calculated. In the weak ﬁeld limit we obtain the familiar non-relativistic results. For
the case of circular polarization our analytical results are in agreement with recent derivations of
Krainov [V.P. Krainov, J. Phys. B, 32, 1607 (1999)].

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently an increasing interest in the investigation of relativistic ionization phenomena has been observed [1–10].
Relativistic eﬀects will appear if the electron velocity in the initial bound state or in the ﬁnal state is comparable with
the speed of light. The initial state should be considered relativistic in the case of inner shells of heavy atoms [3,4].
In a recent paper [10] the photoionization of an atom from a shell with relativistic velocities has been considered for
the case of elliptically polarized laser light. In the present paper we will study the eﬀect of a relativistic ﬁnal-state
of an electron on the ionization of an atom by elliptically polarized light. The initial state will be considered as
nonrelativistic. The ﬁnal-state electron will have an energy in the laser ﬁeld measured by the ponderomotive energy.
If the ponderomotive energy approaches the electron rest energy, then a relativistic treatment of the ionization process
is required. For an infrared laser the necessary intensities are of the order of 1016W cm−2.

Ionization phenomena inﬂuenced by relativistic ﬁnal state eﬀects have been studied for the cases of linearly and
circularly polarized laser radiation both in the tunnel [6,9] and above threshold regimes [2,7]. The ionization rate
for relativistic electrons has been found to be very small for the case of linear polarization [6,7]. On the contrary a
circularly polarized intense laser ﬁeld produces mainly relativistic electrons [2,9].

In the papers of Reiss and of Crawford and Reiss [1,2,7] a covariant version of the so-called strong ﬁeld approximation
[11] has been given for the cases of linear and circular polarization. Within this approximation one calculates the
transition amplitude between the initial state taken as the solution for the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom and
the ﬁnal state described by the relativistic Volkov solution. Coulomb corrections are neglected in the ﬁnal Volkov
state. Analytical results for the ionization rate have been given in Refs. [1,2,7] These results apply to above barrier
cases as well as to tunneling cases. However, the corresponding expressions are complicated and numerical calculations
are needed to present the ﬁnal results.

The present paper is aimed to investigate the relativistic electron energy spectra in the ionization of atoms by
intense elliptically polarized laser light. In contrast to the more sophisticated strong ﬁeld approximation we would
like to obtain simple analytical expressions from which the dependence of the ionization process on the parameters,
such as binding energy of the atom, ﬁeld strength, frequency and ellipticity of the laser radiation may be understood
without the need of numerical calculations. Therefore we restrict the considerations to the case of tunnel ionization.
Fa. In order to
Our results will be applicable only for laser ﬁeld strengths smaller than the inner atomic ﬁeld F
observe relativistic eﬀects, the inequality ǫ = F/ωc > 0.1 should be fulﬁlled. (The atomic system of units is used
throughout the paper, m = e = ¯h = 1.) Both inequalities yield a limitation for the laser frequency ω from above. For
the ionization of multi-charged ions an infrared laser satisﬁes this condition.

polarization; the most probable momentum at the time of ejection has the components: px = py = 0 and pz = gF/ω.

II. RELATIVISTIC SEMICLASSICAL APPROACH

We shall now generalize the non-relativistic result Eq. (1) to the case of relativistic ﬁnal state eﬀects, when gF/ω
becomes comparable with the velocity of light. Our derivation starts with the relativistic version of the Landau-
Dykhne formula [3,5,10]. The ionization probability in quasiclassical approximation and with exponential accuracy
reads

In the latter we will neglect the
inﬂuence of the atomic core. Then the ﬁnal-state action may be found as a solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation

Eq. (2) together with Eqs. (3) and (6) is the most general expression for the relativistic rate of sub-barrier ionization by
c2. Furthermore
elliptically polarized laser light. We consider now the limit of a nonrelativistic initial state, i.e. Eb ≪
1, or, equivalently, the Keldysh adiabatic
the considerations will be restricted to the tunnel regime λ =

1. Under these conditions we may expand the sine and cosine functions
in Eqs. (3) and (6) in Taylor series. Then we obtain the rate of tunnel ionization for arbitrary ﬁnal-state momenta.
Expanding this expression near its maximum value in terms of the parameters q, py and pz one arrives at the following

Here θ is the angle between the polarization plane and the direction of the photoelectron motion; ϕ is the angle
between the projection of the electron momentum onto the polarization plane and the smaller axis of the polarization
< 1 the most probable momentum pm of the ejected electron is situated in the
ellipse. For the ellipticity 0 <
plane perpendicular to the maximum value of the electric ﬁeld strength; for
= 1 the electron output in the (y, z)
plane is isotropic. Notice that the most probable total electron momentum pm contains relativistic ﬁnal state eﬀects,
frequency corrections and weak relativistic initial state eﬀects. Relativistic eﬀects do not contribute to the projection
of the momentum along the smaller axis of the polarization ellipse. On the contrary both relativistic ﬁnal and initial
state eﬀects increase the electron momentum projection along the propagation of elliptically polarized laser radiation.
The increase due to relativistic initial state eﬀects is proportional to (Eb/c2)(1 + g2). It is typically small (except for
the ionization from K shells of heavy atoms [3,10]) and does not vanish in the case of linear polarization of the laser
light. In contrast to that the relativistic increase due to ﬁnal state eﬀects which is measured by F g/2ωc is absent in
the case of linear polarized laser radiation.

In what follows we will neglect the frequency corrections and the relativistic initial state eﬀects in order to compare
with previous works.
In this case and for the case of circular polarization the expressions for the angle θm and
the most probable electron momentum pm coincide with the corresponding expressions of Krainov [9]. Moreover,
though our calculations are valid only in the tunnel regime, our value for the most probable angle of electron ejection
coincides with an approximation given by Reiss for the case of circular polarization [1,2] and valid in the above-barrier
ionization regime. In Ref. [2] it has been shown that the simple estimate tan θm = F/2cω is in good agreement with
the numerical calculations based on the strong-ﬁeld approximation and performed for above threshold conditions with
circularly polarized light. Therefore we expect that our formula Eq. (10) predicts, at least qualitatively, the location
of the peak in the relativistic angular distribution for the case of above barrier ionization with elliptically polarized
light.

This statement is supported by a semiclassical consideration of the above barrier ionization. According to the
semiclassical model [14] the transition occurs from the bound state to that continuum state which has zero velocity
at the time t with the phase ξ of the vector potential A(ξ). From this condition we have

The ionization rate becomes maximal at the maximum of the electric ﬁeld of the laser beam. Due to our choice
(12) and the relation px =

is the width of the relativistic energy distribution. From Eq. (17) we conclude that the relativistic width is broader

In Fig. 1 the electron momentum spectrum from Eq. (16) is shown for electrons born in the creation of Ne8+ (Eb =

and ellipticity g = 0.707. The relativistic spectrum is compared with the spectrum of nonrelativistic theory. From
the ﬁgure one sees the shift of the energy spectrum to higher energies, the relativistic broadening of the spectrum is
too small to be observed from the ﬁgure.

We see that the relativistic theory predicts a narrower angular distribution as the nonrelativistic theory. The inﬁnite
width in the case of linear polarization is an artefact of the calculations using the angle between the polarization
plane and the direction of electron movement. For the linear polarization the electrons are ejected preferably along
the polarization axis if one neglects relativistic initial state eﬀects. For the case of circular polarization the energy-
angular distributions Eqs. (16) and (18) coincide with the corresponding expressions of Krainov [9]. Notice that our
notations slightly diﬀer from those of Krainov.

In Fig. 2 we have plotted the relativistic and non-relativistic angular distributions for the electrons produced by the

the nonrelativistic theory predicts a peak at the zero angle. Again the relativistic reduction of the angular distribution
width is not observable for the parameters we have chosen. From Figs. 1 and 2 one concludes that the appearance of a
nonzero mean of the drift momentum component along the beam propagation and the shift of the mean emission angle
into the forward direction are the most important indications for a relativistic ionization process. On the contrary
the width of the energy-angle distributions as well as the total ionization rate are less sensitive to the relativistic ﬁnal
state eﬀects.

In conclusions, in this paper the relativistic semiclassical ionization of an atom in the presence of intense elliptically
polarized laser light has been considered. Simple analytic expressions for the relativistic photoelectron spectrum have
been obtained. For the cases of linear and circular polarization our results agree with previous studies. We have
shown that the location of the peak in the relativistic angular distribution is shifted toward the direction of beam
propagation. The theoretical approach employed in the paper predicts that the maximum of the electron energy
spectrum is increased due to relativistic eﬀects. The validity of the simple expressions is formally limited to the
tunnel regime. Nevertheless, a part of the results, such as the most probable angle for electron emission, is shown to
be valid in the above barrier ionization regime as well. The results obtained in this paper within exponential accuracy
may be improved by the account of Coulomb corrections. However, whereas the Coulomb corrections may strongly
inﬂuence the total ionization rate [15,16] we expect only a small inﬂuence of the atomic core on the electron spectrum.

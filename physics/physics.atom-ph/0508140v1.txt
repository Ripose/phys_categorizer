Siegert pseudostate perturbation theory: one- and two-threshold cases

Perturbation theory for the Siegert pseudostates (SPS) [Phys. Rev. A58, 2077 (1998) and
Phys. Rev. A67, 032714 (2003)] is studied for the case of two energetically separated thresholds.
The perturbation formulas for the one-threshold case are derived as a limiting case whereby we
reconstruct More’s theory for the decaying states [Phys. Rev. A3, 1217 (1971)] and amend an error.
The perturbation formulas for the two-threshold case have additional terms due to the non-standard
orthogonality relationship of the Siegert Pseudostates. We apply the theory to a 2-channel model
problem, and ﬁnd the rate of convergence of the perturbation expansion should be examined with
n λnE(n)|| instead of the real and imaginary parts of the
the aide of the variance D = ||E −
perturbation energy individually.

INTRODUCTION

P

Resonances occur in a variety of ﬁelds of physical sci-
ences. Despite their diversity, they are characterized
by two parameters, the resonance energy position and
width, apart from the coupling with the background con-
tinuum represented by the Fano proﬁle[1]. A great deal
of discussions have been given to the interpretation of
resonance phenomena[1]. The most familiar parameter-
ization of the resonances is condensed into the disper-
sion formula due to Breit and Wigner. Back in 1939,
Siegert [2] developed a compact mathematical viewpoint
for characterizing resonances as singular points of the
dispersion relation. His idea requires the solution of
the Schr¨odinger equation subject to the outgoing wave
boundary condition,

where a is the radius beyond which the potential en-
ergy is negligible. The solution φ(r) is called the Siegert
state (SS) and it behaves like eikr near r = a and be-
yond. This boundary condition destroys the hermitic-
ity of the Hamiltonian, thus entailing complex-valued
eigenenergies, i.e.,

E =

= Eres − i

This is a most direct representation of both the reso-
nance position and width. This mathematically appeal-
ing representation had been implemented with tedious
iterations due to lack of suitable computational tech-
niques until Tolstikhin et al [3] made a breakthrough
by introducing Siegert pseudostates (SPS) for the one-
threshold case. Their idea incorporates the boundary
condition into the Schr¨odinger equation so that the dis-
persion relation is obtained by a single diagonalization
of the Hamiltonian matrix. Previous applications of SPS
to resonances in three-body Coulomb problems indicate
that it is not only a valid procedure but also a new per-
spective for the SPS representation of resonances and de-
cay processes [4]. Another immediate application of the

SPS theory is to the time-dependent problem[5, 6] where
the reﬂection oﬀ the exterior boundary incurs numerical
instability. Tanabe and Watanabe [7] succeeded in de-
scribing the reﬂectionless time propagation based on the

optical pulses, the Siegert boundary condition indeed was
seen to eliminate the outgoing wave component perfectly.
Recently, Sitnikov and Tolstikhin [8, 9] stretched the
scope of the SPS theory by enabling the treatment of the
two-threshold problem. Despite such progress, there re-
mains in the theory of SPS a chapter still incompletely
worked out. This is the Siegert perturbation theory. A
pioneering work on this subject is due to More[10, 11]
who extended the Siegert state theory speciﬁcally to han-
dle the decaying state. The main purpose of this pa-
per is to complete the Siegert perturbation theory from
the recently developed SPS viewpoint for both one- and
two-threshold cases. Particularly, in the one-threshold
case, we are able to reconstruct More’s theory for decay-
ing states [10] in terms of SPS but with an unexpected
amendment to his theory. The SPS perturbation the-
ory (SPSPT) is by no means straightforward owing to the
non-standard orthonormality of the eigenfunctions. This
constraint also serves to ﬁx the phase of the perturbed
wavefunction, a feature which is absent from the stan-
dard perturbation theory. It is hoped this paper serves
to expose such noteworthy features of the SPSPT.

This paper is thus constructed as follows. In Section II,
we review some basic ideas about the SPS as needed for
an elementary presentation of the perturbation theory.
Section III gives the details of the SPSPT for both one-
and two-threshold cases. And Section III deals with a
speciﬁc mathematical model as an example of the SP-
SPT. Atomic units are used throughout.

II. THE SIEGERT PSEUDOSTATES

Since the two-threshold SPS theory contains the one-
threshold case in itself, we review the two-threshold case
only, leaving the one-threshold case as the limit where
the two-thresholds become degenerate [8].

and Vi pertains to the potential energy of channel i, and
Vij represents the interchannel coupling between chan-
nels i and j. We consider the situation where there are
only two energetically distinct thresholds so that we sep-
arate Vi into two groups. A ﬁrst group contains channels
1, . . . , q1 and they converge to v1 as r → a while the other
group contains channels q1 + 1, . . . , q and they converge
to v2, that is

where v1 and v2 are the two constants representing the
threshold energies. This allows us to use the 2-channel
SPS scheme even in the presence of more than two chan-
nels. The two channel momenta are k1 =

and k2 =

In Eq. (2), IM is an M -dimensional unit matrix. The

It is important to clarify the relationship between one-

limit, the following scaling clariﬁed in Ref. [8],

formulas[10]. Our expressions for the ﬁrst-order eigen-
vector and for the second-order eigenenergy are diﬀer-
ent from his[11]. The origin of the discrepancy has been
traced to an algebraic error in More’s derivation of the
ﬁrst-order wavefunction. (One necessary term is unfor-
tunately dropped during his derivation.) As a result of
this, an extra term is restored in either formula. Here,
one important diﬀerence from the standard perturbation
theory is that no Hermitian conjugates appear in these
formulas. This might suggest at ﬁrst that there would
remain phase ambiguity. However, any ad hoc additive
phase would instead mar the orthogonality relation, that
is what is the relative phase in the standard theory is
ﬁxed in the SPS theory, thus leaving no ambiguity with
the phase of eigen functions.
It is thus worthwhile to
see the consistency of the orthonormality relation and
the Siegert boundary condition for the particular case of
~c(1)
n . This veriﬁcation is worked out in Appendix.

C. A Model Problem

Note that the summation runs over the branch of k1 = k2,
that is only over a half of the full non-degenerate space.
These correspond to the SPS representation of More’s

The potential V (r) supports three resonances. The adia-
batic potential energy curve of the ﬁrst channel supports
one shape type resonance (a) while the other channel
supports one Feshbach type (b) and one shape type (c)
resonance. These resonances are depicted in Fig. 1. We
carried out the diagonalization of the TSE, Eq. (6), using
the discrete variable representation (DVR) functions as a
basis set. The calculated resonance energies and widths
with diﬀerent numbers of the basis functions are given
in Table I. Let us call these results as direct numerical
solutions. To implement perturbation calculations, we
separate V (r) into

V (r) = V0(r) + V

(r)

perturbation energies using the unperturbed solutions of
TSE for the same box size a = 50 as in Ref. [8]. Table
I shows the results of ﬁrst- and second-order perturba-
tion calculations, and Figs. 2-4 depict how the numerical
solutions converge in the complex plane. In the present
model problem, the ﬁrst-order resonance energy agrees
with the direct numerical solutions to about 2 to 4 dig-
its while the width agrees to about 2 to 3 digits. And
the second-oder resonance energy agrees to about 3 to
5 digits while the width agrees to about 1 to 3 digits.
An important fact which we must remark is that the res-
onance energy and width do not appear to converge in
pace. For instance, the width of resonance “c” evaluated
by the second-order perturbation theory appears less ac-
curate than the ﬁrst-order one while the resonance energy
appears to have improved. The seeming deterioration of
the width is a little overwhelming, all the more so for the
improvement of the resonance energy. Nonetheless, the
distance between the second-order result and the direct
numerical one becomes rather small (see Fig. 4) in the
complex plane, that is in the Siegert state perturbation
theory the convergence is to be measured with respect to
the variance

D = ||E −

λnE(n)||

We regard V0 as the unperturbed potential energy and
as the perturbation potential energy. We calculate
V

rather than with respect to the real and imaginary parts
of the sum, individually.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

V. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

In this paper we formulated one- and two-threshold
SPSPT. The unusual orthonormality relationship of the
SPSs results in somewhat nontrivial additional terms in
SPSPT, and also it determines the phase of the perturba-
tion wavefunction. In the degenerate threshold case, the
one-threshold SPSPT formulas are obtained by appropri-
ate scaling, and we also obtained an up-to-date correction
to More’s theory. The numerical calculations show how
the perturbation results converge. The convergence is
achieved in the sense of the variance, Eq. 24, but not the
resonance energy and width independently.

It is of interest to speculate on possible uses of SPSPT.
One immediate application would be to the manipulation
of Siegert poles. The shadow poles located near the phys-
ical sheet may be transformed to physical resonances by
an appropriate perturbation. We leave issues such as this
for a future task.

We thank Dr. Tolstikhin for useful discussions. This

Therefore, the ﬁrst-order wavefunction is consistent with
the orthonormality relationship.

Next, let us consider the Siegert boundary condition.
We expand the Siegert boundary condition and compare
both sides power by power for λ. The ﬁrst-order equation

The motion of metastable helium atoms travelling through a standing light wave is investigated
with a semi-classical numerical model. The results of a calculation including the velocity dependence
of the dipole force are compared with those of the commonly used approach, which assumes a
conservative dipole force. The comparison is made for two atom guiding regimes that can be used
for the production of nanostructure arrays; a low power regime, where the atoms are focused in a
standing wave by the dipole force, and a higher power regime, in which the atoms channel along the
potential minima of the light ﬁeld. In the low power regime the diﬀerences between the two models
are negligible and both models show that, for lithography purposes, pattern widths of 150 nm can
be achieved. In the high power channelling regime the conservative force model, predicting 100 nm
features, is shown to break down. The model that incorporates velocity dependence, resulting in a
structure size of 40 nm, remains valid, as demonstrated by a comparison with quantum Monte-Carlo
wavefunction calculations.

INTRODUCTION

The dipole force in a standing-wave light ﬁeld has been
used to create nanoscale patterns with beams of neu-
tral atoms for many years. The standing wave can act
as an array of optical lenses to focus the atoms dur-
ing deposition onto a substrate, thereby creating a one-
dimensional structure. The ﬁrst experiments using this
technique were performed ten years ago with sodium [1]
and chromium [2] atoms. Since then, atom lithogra-
phy with aluminium [3], cesium [4], metastable argon [5],
and metastable neon [6] has also been reported. For an
overview of atom lithography, see Ref. [7]. The results of
a number of these experiments have been compared with
semi-classical numerical calculations [8, 9]. These calcu-
lations are based on a dipole force that is derived from an
optical potential to focus the atoms in the standing light
wave. This force is conservative and does not take into
account the velocity dependence. Quantum-mechanical
calculations have been performed as well [10]. These
calculations do not suﬀer from this restriction. How-
ever, they are computationally intensive and describe the
atomic motion in one dimension only.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate in detail
the 3D atomic motion through a standing-wave light ﬁeld
using a semi-classical approach with a non-conservative,
velocity dependent dipole force. The results of these sim-
ulations are compared with calculations using the con-
ventional model with a conservative dipole force. The
model presented in this paper follows the approach of
Minogin and Serimaa [11], where the dipole force is rep-

resented in the form of a Fourier series, with coeﬃcients
that are calculated with a continued fraction method.
Previously, a similar model was used to calculate a one-
dimensional beam proﬁle of sodium atoms in the far ﬁeld
[12, 13]. The model that is presented here describes a full
3D simulation of the motion of metastable helium atoms
through a standing light wave for the purpose of atom
lithography applications. Not only the usual low power
regime, where the atoms are focused in the standing light
wave, is investigated, but also a higher power regime. In
the latter regime the atoms channel through the standing
wave, undergoing a damped oscillation around the poten-
tial minima of the light ﬁeld. This is of special interest
for lithography, as it allows the production of nanostruc-
tures with relative insensitivity to the exact alignment of
atomic beam, substrate, and light ﬁeld. It is, however,
also at these higher laser powers that the potential model
is expected to break down and the inclusion of the ve-
locity dependence of the force is essential. Experiments
in this novel regime with metastable helium atoms have
been performed and, in a future paper, the experimental
pattern widths will be compared with the calculations
presented in this paper. With metastable helium atoms,
nanoscale structures can be created in a gold ﬁlm on a sil-
icon substrate via a two-step process [14]. First, the high
internal energy of the focused helium atoms (20 eV) in
the 2 3S1 metastable state is used to selectively damage
an organic resist layer through the standing light wave.
Next, the pattern is transferred to the underlying gold
ﬁlm by means of a wet etching process.

In the simulations, the light ﬁeld is blue detuned from
the 2 3S1 → 2 3P2 optical transition (λ = 1083 nm) of the
helium atom. The atoms are therefore attracted to the
intensity minima of the standing light wave, which min-
imizes spontaneous emission of photons by the atoms.
The atomic motion is calculated using only the dipole
force. The atomic momentum diﬀusion due to ﬂuctua-

tions of the dipole force is neglected. The momentum
diﬀusion is caused by the variation in the number of
absorbed and emitted photons, and by the random di-
rection of the spontaneously emitted photons. Further-
more, the atom is assumed to remain in a steady state,
i.e., transient eﬀects of the dipole force are neglected.
In order to investigate the eﬀects of momentum diﬀu-
sion and transient eﬀects, some results from Monte Carlo
Wave Function (MCWF) calculations similar to Lee [10]
are presented as well. These calculations include the
velocity dependence of the force, momentum diﬀusion,
atomic diﬀraction as well as transient eﬀects. However,
they are one-dimensional and require signiﬁcant compu-
tational resources.

In the next section, a general expression for the dipole
force is derived, and both semi-classical models are out-
lined. Sec. III describes the method and the parameters
of the numerical simulation. The results of the semi-
classical simulations are presented in Sec. IV, and they
are compared with the MCWF simulations. Finally, con-
cluding remarks are given in Sec. V.

II. THEORETICAL MODELS

A. Dipole force of a standing wave

The light force experienced by a two-level atom due to
the presence of a classically described light ﬁeld can be
determined by calculating the change in momentum ~p of
the atom under inﬂuence of the Hamiltonian:

H = HA − ~d · ~E,

(1)

where HA contains the internal and kinetic energy of the
atom and ~d · ~E is the dipole interaction operator that
describes the coupling between the atomic dipole moment
~d and the electric ﬁeld component ~E of the light ﬁeld.
According to the Ehrenfest theorem, the quantum-me-
chanical analogue of the radiation force is given by the
Heisenberg equation of motion

(2)
In the last step of Eq. (2) the expectation value of the
electric ﬁeld operator ~E is replaced by the value at the
atomic centre of mass. This is legitimate in the electric
dipole approximation, where the wavelength of the light
ﬁeld λ is large compared to the de Broglie wavelength
λdB = ¯h/|~p| of the atom, and spatial variations of the
electric ﬁeld on the scale of the atomic wave-packet can
be neglected.

The expectation value of the electric dipole operator
~d can be written in terms of the atomic density matrix
ρ, which describes the quantum-mechanical state of the

2

two-level atom, as

h~di = Tr(ρ ~d) = ~dge(ρge + ρeg)

= 2 ~dge(u(t) cos ωt − v(t) sin ωt),

(3)

where the atomic density matrix elements ρge and ρeg =
ρ∗
ge are the electronic coherences between the ground
state and the excited state of the atom, ω is the fre-
quency of the radiation ﬁeld, and u(t) and v(t) are two
components of the Bloch vector. In the rotating-wave ap-
proximation, where non-resonant terms of the atom-light
interactions are neglected, the components of the Bloch
vector can be written as

u(t) =

(ρgeeiωt + ρege−iωt),

v(t) =

(ρgeeiωt − ρege−iωt),

w(t) =

(ρee − ρgg),

(4)

where the atomic density matrix elements ρgg and ρee
are the populations of the ground state and the excited
state of the atom, normalized to ρgg + ρee = 1. For a
travelling wave, the electric ﬁeld component of the light
ﬁeld is given by

~E(~r, t) = ~ε(~r) E0(~r) cos (ωt + Φ(~r)),

(5)

where ~ε(~r), E0(~r), and Φ(~r) (= −~k · ~r) are the polariza-
tion, amplitude and phase of the light wave respectively
at the atomic centre-of-mass position ~r = (x, y, z). The
Rabi frequency Ω(~r) of the light ﬁeld is then deﬁned as

Ω(~r) = −

~dge · ~ε(~r) E0(~r)
¯h

.

(6)

The general expression for the light force (in the electric
dipole and rotating-wave approximations) can be written
as [15]

~F

= ~F (~r) = −¯hust∇Ω(~r) − ¯hΩ(~r)vst∇Φ(~r).

(7)

D

E

The two parts on the right-hand side of Eq. (7) are the
dipole force, proportional to the gradient of the Rabi fre-
quency Ω(~r), and the scattering force, proportional to
the gradient of the phase Φ(~r) of the light ﬁeld. The
Bloch vector components u(t) and v(t) are replaced by
their time-independent steady-state values ust and vst re-
spectively. This is valid in the adiabatic approximation,
where the atom moves slowly enough in the light ﬁeld to
maintain an equilibrium between its internal state and
the radiation ﬁeld.

The steady-state values can be found by solving the
equations of motion of the optical Bloch vector that de-
scribe the time evolution of a two-level atom in a light
ﬁeld

The electric ﬁeld component of a standing-wave light
ﬁeld, composed of an incident and back-reﬂected Gaus-
sian wave travelling in the x-direction, can be written as

Eq. (14) is a well-known expression for the dipole force
and it is commonly used for semi-classical calculations
of atomic motion in a standing-wave light ﬁeld [1, 2, 9].
Since this force is conservative, the kinetic energy of the
atom at any moment is determined by the local potential
of the light ﬁeld.

where k is the wave number of the light and wy and wz
are the waists of the Gaussian beam proﬁle in the y and

phase dependence, the phase gradient term in Eq. (7)
vanishes. The general solution of the light force in a
standing-wave light ﬁeld then becomes
~Fsw(~r) = −¯hust∇Ω(~r).

(10)

The steady-state value of the optical Bloch vector com-
ponent ust can be derived using two diﬀerent approaches;
one that neglects the atomic velocity (Sec. II B), and one
that is valid for arbitrary atomic velocities (Sec. II C).

B. Atom at rest – potential model

When the transverse velocity of the atom in a standing-
wave light ﬁeld is negligible (~k · ~v ≪ Γ), the atom travels
over a very small distance compared to the optical wave-
length λ during the relaxation time Γ−1 of the atom. The
optical Bloch equations given in Eq. (8) can then be con-
sidered as a set of coupled linear diﬀerential equations
with time-independent coeﬃcients. The steady-state so-
lutions are found analytically by setting ˙u = ˙v = ˙w = 0
and they are given by

is the saturation parameter. The ﬁnal expression for the
dipole force acting on an atom at rest in a standing-wave
light ﬁeld, can now be found by combining Eq. (10) and
Eq. (11)

~Fpot(~r) = −¯h∆

∇Ω2(~r)
2Ω2(~r) + Γ2 + 4∆2 .

(13)

This force is conservative and it can be written as the
gradient of a potential [15, 16]

~Fpot(~r) = −∇U (~r) = −∇ ¯h∆
2

ln [1 + s(~r)].

(14)

When an atom moves with velocity ~v 6= 0 in the
standing-wave light ﬁeld, the position of the atom ~r be-
comes explicitly time dependent as ~r(t) = ~vt. However,
the time dependence of the transverse coordinates y and
z can be neglected, since the wavelength of the light λ
is much smaller than the waist of the Gaussian beam
proﬁle. This means that the optical Bloch vector com-
ponents u, v, and w change more rapidly along the axis
of the light ﬁeld (x-direction) than in the transverse di-
rections y and z. Therefore, for ﬁnding the steady-state
solution of the optical Bloch vector components, only the
time dependence of the x-coordinate has to be taken into
account. The Rabi frequency Ω(~r) can then be written
as a periodic function of time

Ω(~r, t) = Ω0(y, z) sin(kx)

= Ω0(y, z) sin(kvxt),

(15)

where Ω0(y, z) is the peak Rabi frequency at the anti-
nodes of the standing wave, and vx is the velocity of the
atom parallel to the axis of the light ﬁeld. With the Rabi
frequency given by Eq. (15), the coeﬃcients of the cou-
pled linear diﬀerential equations in Eq. (8) become time
dependent. Consequently, the optical Bloch equations
can no longer be solved analytically. However, a steady-
state solution of u, v and w can be found by expanding
each of them in a Fourier series

h(~r) =

hn(y, z) einkx,

n=−∞
X

(11)

(12)

where the common notation h is used for u, v, and w, and
the quantities hn satisfy the reality condition h−n = h∗
n.
By substituting the Fourier expansions Eq. (16) and the
expression for the Rabi frequency given by Eq. (15) in
the optical Bloch equations Eq. (8), a set of recursive al-
gebraic equations is obtained for the optical Bloch vector
components [11]

(Γ/2 + inkvx)un = ∆vn,
(Γ/2 + inkvx)vn = −Ω0 (wn−1 + wn+1) − ∆un,

(Γ + inkvx)wn = Ω0 (vn−1 + vn+1) −

The dipole force is now also represented in the form of a
Fourier series, where the Fourier coeﬃcients can be cal-
culated from the optical Bloch vector components. The
expression for the dipole force can be separated into com-
ponents parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the

The coeﬃcients un are obtained from the solution of the
recursion relations (Eq. (17)) in the form of convergent
continued fractions. The dipole force given by Eq. (18)
and Eq. (19) is dissipative, and the atomic energy is
therefore not conserved. The momentum change of the
atom can be attributed to an additional damping or heat-
ing force, dependent on the intensity of the light ﬁeld and
on the sign of its detuning from atomic resonance.

described in detail by Minogin and Letokhov [17] and it
is summarized for completeness in the appendix. The so-
lutions for the coeﬃcients are found in the form of con-
vergent continued fractions. For the simulations, these
continued fractions are calculated with an accuracy bet-
ter than 10−16, which requires a maximum of 5000 terms.
This precision is necessary to calculate the coeﬃcients un
with an accuracy better than 1 ppm. The Fourier series
that represent the expression for the dipole force contain
at most 2500 Fourier coeﬃcients. A convergence analy-
sis has shown that the dipole force change is negligible
at higher accuracies of the coeﬃcients un and when more
terms are added to the Fourier series. Therefore the level
of convergence is assumed to be suﬃcient.

(cid:17)

B. Parameters

The calculations are performed on a beam of helium
atoms in the 2 3S1 metastable state, which has a lifetime
of about 8000 s. The atomic beam has a mean longi-
tudinal velocity of 2000 m/s and a longitudinal velocity
spread (full width at 1/e2 height) of 650 m/s. After col-
limation of the beam, the transverse velocity spread of
the atoms is reduced to about 3 m/s. For the calcula-
tions, each atom is assigned a longitudinal and transverse
initial velocity that is randomly picked from Gaussian
velocity distributions with the above described averages
and spreads.

The light of the standing wave has a wavelength of
1083 nm, driving the 2 3S1 → 2 3P2 optical transition of
the helium atom, which has a natural linewidth Γ/2π =
1.6 MHz. By detuning the light ﬁeld relatively far to the
blue side of the atomic resonance (∆/2π = 375 MHz),
the atoms are attracted to the nodes of the standing-
wave light ﬁeld, which reduces spontaneous emissions.
An upper limit for the detuning forms the 2 3P1 state,
which energy level lies 2.3 GHz above the 2 3P2 state.
For very large blue detunings of the light ﬁeld from the
2 3P2 state, the atom can thus interact with the light
ﬁeld via the 2 3S1 → 2 3P1 transition.

The Rabi frequency can be calculated from the inten-

sity of the light ﬁeld as

The dipole force derived from the two models de-
scribed in Sec. II B and Sec. II C is used to calculate the
atomic movement through a standing-wave light ﬁeld. By
straightforward numerical integration of the Newtonian
equations of motion, the change of the atomic velocity
and position under inﬂuence of the dipole force at the
current position of the atom in the light ﬁeld is calcu-
lated. In this way a full 3D simulation of the atom tra-
jectories and velocities in the standing-wave light ﬁeld
is performed. The atomic pattern formation is mapped
with 2D atomic distribution plots in the xy-plane and in
histograms.

(24)

where P0 is the power of the incident light beam. De-
pending on this power, two diﬀerent regimes can be dis-
tinguished for guiding the atoms through the standing-
wave light ﬁeld. At low power, the atoms can be focused
at the centre of the Gaussian light beam. For large de-
tunings (∆ ≫ Γ), the power required for this focusing
can be calculated from [9]

P0 = 5.37

2¯hΓ2k2

.

(25)

This focusing power is independent of the waist of the
light beam. For the conditions mentioned above, P0 =
2.4 mW. For high-power light ﬁelds, the atoms oscillate
through a potential minimum of the standing wave and
the sign of the transverse velocity of the atoms changes
many times. This is called the channelling regime. For
calculations in this regime a power P0 = 800 mW is
used. The dipole force in the channelling regime is then
about one order of magnitude larger than in the focusing
regime.

C. The dipole force

The velocity dependence of the x-component of the
dipole force in the focusing and channelling regime for
both models is depicted in Fig. 1. The graphs show that,
in the focusing regime (left graph), the diﬀerence be-
tween the dipole force according to the potential model
and the Minogin model is very small (at most 0.3%).
In the channelling regime (right graph), however, the

dipole force of the two models diﬀers signiﬁcantly. The
force shows a negative slope for small transverse velocities
(|kvx/Γ| < 0.2), which means that the force is a damping
force. This cooling eﬀect is essentially the “blue-detuned
Sisyphus cooling” introduced by Dalibard and Cohen-
Tannoudji [18]. At larger velocities, the dipole force in
the Minogin model is signiﬁcantly larger than in the po-
tential model. It is therefore expected that the distinc-
tion between the two models will be most pronounced in
the channelling regime. Furthermore, in the channelling
regime, the Minogin model shows some resonance peaks
at high atom velocities. These are called Doppleron res-
onances [19], and occur when the atom is excited to the
2 3P2 state by multiple photon absorptions and emis-
sions. When an atom absorbs (n + 1) photons from one
wave of the standing-wave light ﬁeld, and emits n pho-
tons into the other, these resonances appear at velocities

IV. RESULTS

Fig. 2 shows a projection on the xz-plane of the atomic
motion through the standing-wave light ﬁeld in the focus-
ing regime (upper graphs) and channelling regime (lower
graphs). The centre of the Gaussian light beam, which
propagates in the x-direction, is located at z = 0. The
graphs cover half a wavelength (λ/2 = 542 nm) of the
standing-wave light ﬁeld, showing exactly one potential
minimum through which the atoms travel in the positive
z-direction (from left to right). To allow the atoms to ex-
perience a maximum dipole force, the starting y-position
is y = 0 for all atoms. However, since the simulations
are 3D and the atoms have an initial velocity in the y-

direction, this position is not maintained while travelling
through the light ﬁeld.

Since the velocity dependence of the dipole force in
the focusing regime is almost negligible (see Fig. 1), the
atomic motion in this regime according to the potential
model (upper left graph) is very similar to the calcula-
tion with the Minogin model (upper centre graph). In
the channelling regime, the calculated trajectories diﬀer
considerably for the potential model (lower left graph)
and the Minogin model (lower centre graph), due to the
higher average value and the strong velocity dependence
of the dipole force in the latter model (see Fig. 1). The
potential model is invalid in this regime, since the atoms
have a transverse velocity spread of 3 m/s (kvx/Γ = 1.7),
and the transverse velocity of the atoms can even be-
come on the order of 10 m/s in the standing wave. In
the channelling graph of Fig. 2, the additional damping
force results in an increased conﬁnement of the atoms in
the potential well of the standing wave. The upper right
and lower right graphs of Fig. 2 show one-dimensional
MCWF calculations for the focusing regime and chan-
nelling regime respectively. In these calculations atomic
diﬀraction, velocity dependence and momentum diﬀusion
are fully incorporated. The plots show the atomic den-
sity distribution on a grey-scale for 225 quantum tra-
jectories, corresponding to the same initial distribution
as used for the semi-classical simulations. The charac-
teristic feather-like structures in the channelling regime
(lower right graph) do not constitute a speciﬁc quantum
feature. They correspond to (approximate) caustics in
the semi-classical trajectories and they become clearly
visible if a larger number of trajectories is plotted in the

window in the x-direction, from x = −λ/4 to x = λ/4.
In the focusing regime, the light-ﬁeld does not act as a
perfect lens, but shows some abberations. This imper-
fection is enhanced by the longitudinal and transverse
velocity spread of the atoms. As a result, the best posi-
tion to place the sample is not at the centre of the light
beam (z = 0), but slightly behind it. For the channelling
regime, the sample position is far less critical, but the
best results are at similar positions. Therefore, the com-
parison of the two regimes for the diﬀerent models in
Fig. 3 is performed at z = wz/4 = 83 µm, where optimal
results are expected.

The ﬁrst two plots show the atom distributions in the
focusing regime for the potential model (ﬁrst plot) and
the Minogin model (second plot). As expected from the
comparison of the trajectories in this regime, shown in
the upper graphs of Fig. 2, the diﬀerences between the
two models are negligible. The distributions in the chan-
nelling regime with the potential model (third plot) and
the Minogin model (fourth plot) show that the atoms are
conﬁned for a wider range along the y-axis as compared
to the focusing regime. Furthermore, for the Minogin
model, the atoms are more localized to the nodes of the
standing wave.

To make a more quantitative comparison of the four
plots of Fig. 3, histograms of the atom distributions are
presented in Fig. 4. Only the atoms located between
y = −100 µm and y = 100 µm are taken into account
for the histograms, because atoms outside this region
do not contribute to the desired pattern (in the focus-
ing regime). The black curves through the histograms
are Lorentzian ﬁts from which the Full Width at Half

Maximum (FWHM) of the distribution can be deduced.
The upper graphs, that represent the calculations in the
focusing regime, show that the FWHM of the distribu-
tion is 150 nm for both semi-classical models as well as
for the quantum-mechanical model. For the calculations
in the channelling regime (lower graphs), the distribu-
tion of the potential model (left graph) has a FWHM of
98 nm. This width deviates clearly from the distribu-
tion of the Minogin model (centre graph), which has a
FWHM of 40 nm. The smaller width of this distribu-
tion can be explained from the additional cooling force
that is included in the Minogin model. The distributions
for the full quantum-mechanical calculations are shown
in the right graphs. The FWHM of the central peak is
45 nm, somewhat larger than the results from the con-
tinued fraction semi-classical results. This larger width
is mostly due to the fact that the steady-state situation
for the atoms is not completely realized during the inter-
action time. Achieving a steady state requires a number
of spontaneous emissions per atom. Due to the large de-
tuning of the light ﬁeld from atomic resonance, and due
to the fact that the atoms are channelled in the region
of low light intensity, almost one half of the atoms never
undergoes a spontaneous emission. The inﬂuence of dif-
fusion is seen in the wings of the MCWF distributions.
However, overall the MCWF results agree very well with
the semi-classical calculations using the Minogin model,
conﬁrming the large reduction in the FWHM of the dis-
tribution due to the cooling force.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The simulations have shown that nanoscale patterns
can be created utilizing the optical dipole force to guide
atoms through a standing-wave light ﬁeld. For the cal-
culation of the atomic motion, two models have been
applied: a simple one that uses the conventional dipole
force, derived from a potential, and another one that in-
cludes the velocity dependence of this dipole force. In the
‘conventional’ focusing regime, where a low-power light
ﬁeld is used, the diﬀerences between the potential model
and the Minogin model are negligible. Both models show
that in principle nanoscale pattern sizes of 150 nm can be
achieved with the speciﬁed experimental parameters. It
should be noted, that these parameters are not optimized
for focusing: using a smaller laser focus and more laser
power, much tighter focusing can be achieved without en-
tering the channelling regime. However, the sample po-
sition is very critical, and good focusing is only achieved
for atoms that pass the light ﬁeld close to its centre. The
high-power channelling regime, that we are presently us-
ing for nanostructure production with metastable helium
atoms, is more robust. It is therefore better suitable for

model shows strong deviations from the potential model,
due to the contribution of velocity dependent terms to
the dipole force. Because of the large transverse veloc-
ity (kvx > Γ) of the atoms in the standing-wave light
ﬁeld, the potential model breaks down and should not
be applied for calculations in this regime. The results
of the calculations with the Minogin model show struc-
tures with a FWHM of 40 nm. This model does not
take into account the momentum diﬀusion and transient
eﬀects, which leads to broadening of the structure size,
as is shown by the MCWF simulations. However, the
MCWF simulations support the results of the Minogin
model by showing a better conﬁnement of the atoms in
the standing-wave light ﬁeld than expected from calcu-
lations with the conventional model. This is due to an
additional cooling force that is not incorporated in the
conventional model.

The determination of the dipole force in the Minogin
model, given by Eqs. (18) and (19), requires the opti-
cal Bloch vector components un, that are embedded in
the expressions of the Fourier coeﬃcients in Eqs. (20) and
(21). The coeﬃcients un can be calculated with a contin-
ued fraction method according to Minogin and Letokhov
[17]. A summary of this method is described below.

The upper expression of Eq. (17) can be rewritten in

the form

un =

∆
Γ/2 + inkvx

vn.

(A1)

Since vn is non-zero for odd n, and wn is non-zero for
even n, the middle and lower expressions of Eq. (17) can
be combined to a single expression as

bn − Dn(bn−1 + bn+1) = −δn0/2,

and therefore only non-negative integers (n ≥ 0) have
to be considered. The relation between two successive
quantities bn and bn+1 can then be found by substituting

bn+1 = qnbn

(A6)

into Eq. (A2). This leads to a recursion relation for qn
given by

pn = −DnDn+1.

The quantity b0 = w0 is found by solving Eq. (A2) for
n = 0 and gives

From Eq. (A6) and this initial coeﬃcient b0, all succes-
sive coeﬃcients bn can be calculated. By substituting
the coeﬃcients bn (= vn for odd n) into Eq. (A1), the
coeﬃcients un can be found straightforwardly.

The quantity q0 can now be expressed as a convergent

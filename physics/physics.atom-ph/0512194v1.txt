Abstract

We report on the production of a pulsed molecular beam of metastable NH (a 1∆)
radicals and present ﬁrst results on the Stark deceleration of the NH (a 1∆, J =
2, M Ω = −4) radicals from 550 m/s to 330 m/s. The decelerated molecules are
excited on the spin-forbidden A 3Π ← a 1∆ transition, and detected via their sub-
sequent spontaneous ﬂuorescence to the X 3Σ−, v” = 0 ground-state. These exper-
iments demonstrate the feasibility of our recently proposed scheme [Phys. Rev. A
64 (2001) 041401] to accumulate ground-state NH radicals in a magnetic trap.

1 Introduction

In recent years there has been a growing interest in the development of meth-
ods to produce neutral molecules that are suﬃciently slow that they can be
conﬁned in a trap. This interest is triggered by various potential applications
and by the promise of the occurrence of interesting new physics and chemistry
at the low temperatures and high densities that can ultimately be achieved.
Extensive reviews as well as special issues of scientiﬁc journals on the produc-
tion and application of cold (polar) molecules have recently appeared [1,2,3].

Over the last years, we have developed the method of Stark deceleration of
a molecular beam to produce samples of cold polar molecules. In a Stark

decelerator, the quantum-state speciﬁc force that a polar molecule experiences
in an electric ﬁeld is exploited to manipulate the external degrees of freedom
of a molecule. This force is rather weak, typically some eight to ten orders of
magnitude weaker than the force that the corresponding molecular ion would
experience in the same electric ﬁeld. This force nevertheless suﬃces to achieve
complete control over the motion of polar molecules, using techniques akin
to those used for the control of charged particles. This has been explicitly
demonstrated by the construction of two types of linear accelerators [4,5], a
buncher [6], two types of traps [7,8] and a storage ring [9] for neutral polar
molecules. Recently, the Stark deceleration and trapping technique has been
used to store ground-state OH radicals in an electrostatic quadrupole trap for
times up to seconds at a density of 107 − 108 cm−3 and at a temperature of
50 mK [10].

To be able to study molecular interactions and collective eﬀects in these
trapped samples of polar molecules, the phase-space density needs to be fur-
ther increased, i.e., the number density needs to be made higher and/or the
temperature needs to be reduced. In the Stark deceleration and trap loading
method, only a single loading cycle has been employed thus far. The most
straightforward method to increase the phase-space density of the trapped
molecules would therefore be the accumulation of several packets of deceler-
ated molecules in the trap. Simply re-loading the trap, however, requires open-
ing up the trapping potential thereby either losing or heating the molecules
that are already stored. Recently, we proposed a scheme that circumvents this
fundamental obstacle, a scheme that speciﬁcally allows to accumulate ground-
state NH radicals in a magnetic trap [11]. In this scheme, a beam of NH
molecules in the long-lived metastable a1∆ state is injected into a Stark decel-
erator and brought to a standstill. When the molecules are (almost) standing
still, they are optically pumped to the X 3Σ− electronic ground state by induc-
ing the spin-forbidden A 3Π ← a 1∆ transition [12], followed by spontaneous
emission in the triplet system. In the ground state, the NH molecules can
be magnetically trapped, for instance in a quadrupole magnetic trap. As the
Stark interaction in the ground state is very weak, the electric ﬁelds of the
decelerator hardly eﬀect the magnetic trapping potential and the decelerator
can be switched on again to stop and load the next pulse of NH radicals.

The success and usefulness of the proposed accumulation scheme depends on
the availability of an intense pulsed source of slow metastable NH (a 1∆) rad-
icals that is suited to be coupled to a Stark decelerator. Furthermore, optical
pumping of the decelerated NH (a 1∆) radicals to their electronic ground state
needs to be performed. In this Letter we describe a production method for a
pulsed molecular beam of metastable NH (a 1∆) radicals and in a preliminary
experiment the deceleration of NH radicals from 550 m/s to 330 m/s is demon-
strated. The decelerated molecules are excited to the A 3Π state and detected
via their subsequent emission to the electronic ground-state. An experimen-

2

tal procedure that might allow further cooling of a decelerated packet of NH
molecules during the loading of the magnetic trap is proposed and discussed.

2 A pulsed slow molecular beam of NH (a 1∆) radicals

For the deceleration and trapping of NH radicals an intense pulsed beam of
metastable NH radicals with a low initial velocity is required. Although many
cell experiments with NH (a 1∆), using a variety of production schemes, have
been carried out, only a few studies have been performed with metastable NH
in a pulsed [13,14,15,16] or continuous [17,18] molecular beam. In most of the
beam studies, photo-dissociation of the precursors HN3, HNCO, or NH3 has
been used.

Our experiments are performed in a molecular beam machine that consists
of a diﬀerentially pumped source chamber and a detection chamber that are
separated by a 1.5 mm diameter skimmer. The NH beam is produced by
photo-dissociation of hydrazoic acid (HN3) by focussing the 80 mJ output of
a quadrupled Nd:YAG laser at 266 nm just in front of the nozzle oriﬁce of
a pulsed supersonic valve (Jordan Inc.). Using this production scheme, the
NH radicals are almost exclusively produced in the a 1∆ state, since the NH
(X 3Σ−) + N2 channel is spin forbidden [19,20,21]. The HN3 gas is produced
online by heating sodium azide in excess of stearic acid to 95 ◦C to drive oﬀ the
gaseous hydrazoic acid. In order to reduce the initial velocity of the molecular
beam, either Argon, Krypton or Xenon is co-expanded from the pulsed valve
as inert carrier gas. Unfortunately, Xe is observed to eﬃciently quench the NH
(a 1∆) radicals, an eﬀect that has been well documented before [13,22,23]. The
mechanism that causes the fast quenching rate for Xe is at present unknown
[18,24]. The quenching rate for Kr is about three orders of magnitude smaller
than for Xe [25], suﬃciently low to enable the use of Kr as a carrier gas in our
experiments.

The molecular beam is characterized by detecting the NH radicals about 24 cm
downstream from the nozzle by a resonant Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF)
detection scheme. The populations in the a 1∆ and the X 3Σ− states are probed
by inducing the c 1Π, v = 0 ← a 1∆, v = 0 transition around 326 nm and the
A 3Π, v = 0 ← X 3Σ−, v = 0 transition around 336 nm, respectively, and
by recording the molecular ﬂuorescence. The ﬂuorescence excitation spectrum
that is thus obtained is shown in Figure 1. The observed spectral lines are
labelled using standard spectroscopic nomenclature. The majority of the NH
radicals in the beam resides in the metastable a 1∆ electronic state. The small
percentage of the population that is in the electronic ground state (estimated
to be less than 10%) is believed to originate from electronic quenching of NH
(a 1∆) by collisions with Kr, or from two-photon processes in the dissociation

of HN3. In the a 1∆ state, the rotational level J = 2 is the most populated
one, reﬂecting the eﬃcient rotational cooling in the expansion region of the
supersonic jet. A secondary maximum in the rotational population distribution
is observed around J = 9. A similar bimodal distribution has been observed
before for NH (a 1∆) in a supersonic beam, namely in the production of NH
via photo-dissociation of HN3 at 193 nm in N2 carrier gas [14]. The secondary
maximum reﬂects the nascent rotational distribution of NH (a 1∆) upon photo-
dissociation of HN3, and the low inelastic scattering cross sections for high
values of J. It is evident from the spectrum presented in Figure 1 that, in
spite of the bimodal rotational level distribution, at least 50% of all the NH
(a 1∆, v=0) radicals are in the J=2 rotational ground-state level.

The velocity distribution of the molecular beam critically depends on the time
at which the dissociation laser is ﬁred in the gas pulse that is emanating from
the supersonic valve. The time-interval between the trigger pulse for the pulsed
valve and the trigger pulse for the dissociation laser is indicated by Tdiss. Here
it should be noted that, depending on experimental conditions, the pulsed
valve typically only opens some 0.20–0.21 ms after the trigger is applied; the
dissociation laser ﬁres simultaneous (on this time-scale) with the opening of
the valve. In Fig. 2, the measured time of ﬂight (TOF) proﬁles of the beam
of NH (a 1∆) are shown for diﬀerent values of Tdiss. The population in the
J = 2 level is measured by recording the LIF intensity on the P (2) line of the
c 1Π ← a 1∆ transition. For low values of Tdiss, when the valve is just opening
and when there is no good supersonic expansion yet, the beam typically has
a high mean velocity (>600 m/s), and a relatively large velocity spread. The

4

beam has a maximum peak intensity if the dissociation laser is ﬁred 0.23 ms
after the trigger pulse for the valve. The beam then has the minimum velocity
spread (FWHM) of only 9 %, at a mean velocity of 575 m/s. The latter is still
signiﬁcantly faster than would be expected for a room temperature expansion
of pure Kr, i.e., ∼ 450 m/s. This can be explained in part by the seeding
of the lower mass HN3 molecules but mainly reﬂects the relatively high con-
stant temperature (70◦C) of the valve body during operation. In addition, the
transient high temperature of the gold hairpins of the valve opening mech-
anism, that support a peak current exceeding 4.0 kA when the valve opens,
is known to lead to even higher apparent source temperatures in this type of
valve [26]. For higher values of Tdiss, the beam has a lower mean velocity and
the inferior expansion conditions result in a lower peak intensity and a larger
velocity spread. The decreasing beam velocity over the temporal proﬁle of the
gas pulse, is in part due to cooling of the gold hairpins by the gas that ﬂows
in between them and in part due to the transition from supersonic to eﬀusive
ﬂow.

3 Deceleration of a molecular beam of NH (a 1∆) radicals

In this section, ﬁrst experiments are presented in which the pulsed beam of
NH (a 1∆, J = 2) radicals is decelerated. For this, the Stark decelerator that
we employed recently for the deceleration and trapping of OH radicals [10]

5

is mounted between the source and the detection chamber. The general op-
eration principles and the technical details of this speciﬁc Stark decelerator
are documented extensively elsewhere [27,28], and will not be further detailed
here.

After passing through the skimmer, the NH (a 1∆) radicals are focussed by
a short hexapole into the – just over one meter long – Stark decelerator,
consisting out of 102 electric ﬁeld stages. In each electric ﬁeld stage, a volt-
age diﬀerence of 40 kV between opposing electrodes can be applied, creating
a maximum electric ﬁeld on the molecular beam axis of about 95 kV/cm.
The NH (a 1∆) radicals that exit the decelerator are optically pumped to the
electronic ground state in the LIF detection zone, and are state-selectively
detected in this process. Excitation on the P2(2) line of the spin-forbidden
A 3Π, v = 0 ← a 1∆, v = 0 transition around 584 nm [12] is performed. The
A 3Π, v = 0 → X 3Σ−, v = 0 ﬂuorescence around 336 nm is imaged onto the
photomultiplier (PMT). The detection of the NH radicals in this way is almost
background-free as stray-light from the laser can be eﬀectively blocked by op-
tical ﬁlters in front of the PMT. The transition is induced by the fundamental
output of a ns pulsed dye laser system (Spectra physics, PDL3 combination).
Typically, an energy of 30 mJ in a 4 mm diameter beam with a bandwidth
of 0.04 cm−1 is used, which is not enough to saturate the transition; when a
laser with a superior optical brightness is used, this transition can be readily
saturated [12].

In Fig. 3 the TOF proﬁle of the decelerated NH radicals is shown as obtained
when the Stark decelerator is operated at a phase angle φ0 = 70◦ for a syn-
chronous molecule with an initial velocity of 550 m/s (Ekin = 190 cm−1).
With these settings, the decelerator extracts about 1.2 cm−1 of kinetic energy
from the synchronous molecule in every deceleration stage. NH radicals in the
MJ Ω = −4 component of the a 1∆, J = 2 state are decelerated to a ﬁnal
velocity of 330 m/s (Ekin = 68 cm−1), i.e., almost two-thirds of their kinetic
energy is removed. The decelerated bunch of molecules arrives in the detection
region 2.92 ms after production, about 0.6 ms later than the arrival time of the
original non-decelerated molecular beam (data not shown). The arrival time
distribution that results from a three dimensional trajectory simulation of the
experiment is shown underneath the experimental data. The arrival time of
the packet of decelerated molecules is accurately reproduced by the simula-
tions. The width of the velocity distribution of the decelerated NH radicals
is about 10 m/s, corresponding to a longitudinal translational temperature of
about 0.1 K.

4 Cooling of the beam during trap loading

In the original paper on the accumulation of ground state NH radicals in
a magnetic trap [11], it was proposed to transfer the NH radicals with a
pulsed laser from the a 1∆ state to the X 3Σ state. The strength of the spin-
forbidden A 3Π ← a 1∆ transition [12] suggests, however, that this transfer
can be performed using a cw-laser system as well. In this case, an increase in
the phase-space density of each individual decelerated packet of NH radicals
during the trap loading process is possible, as outlined below.

Whenever a pulsed trap loading scheme is used, either with a pulsed laser
to transfer NH radicals to a magnetic trap or by abruptly switching on an
electrostatic trap, for instance, the upper limit of the phase-space density
that can be achieved in the trap is set by the phase-space density of the
decelerated packet. This upper limit can be reached by perfectly matching the
(6-dimensional) emittance of the decelerator to the acceptance of the trap.
Imperfect matching, either with respect to the velocity or spatial acceptance
of the trap will lead to a reduced number of trapped molecules and/or to
heating up of the trapped molecules, e.g., to a reduced phase-space density.
The longitudinal phase-space distribution of the molecular packet at the exit
of the decelerator is, schematically and idealized, shown in panel a) of Figure
4. By abruptly switching on a trap with a perfectly matched acceptance, this
distribution can be loaded in the trap without loss in phase-space density, as
schematically indicated in panel b).

7

If one uses a spatially localized, continuous and uni-directional means to trans-
fer the decelerated molecules to the trap, time comes in as an extra degree
of freedom. The molecules do not have to arrive at the center of the trap si-
multaneously in order to be transferred. This can be used to advantage when,
for instance, the longitudinal spatial distribution of the packet of decelerated
molecules is allowed to expand before entering the trap region, and when si-
multaneously the longitudinal velocity spread of the packet is reduced [6].
When there is in addition a small, overall deceleration when the molecules ap-
proach the trap center, the (idealized) longitudinal phase-space distribution
as depicted in panel c) can be realized. In this case, the NH radicals can be
pumped to the magnetic trap by the continuous laser, which only irradiates
near the center of the trap, and their density near the trap center will thus
increase. In panel d) of Figure 4 it is shown how the longitudinal phase-space
distribution depicted in panel c) can be compressed to a higher ﬁnal phase-
space density via this cw-laser loading scheme.

elongated, but velocity compressed, longitudinal phase-space distribution (panel
c)) that can be transferred to the trap by a spatially localized laser, resulting in an
increased phase-space density in the trap (panel d)).

In order to estimate the increase is phase-space density that can be accom-
plished with this scheme we performed preliminary one-dimensional trajec-
tory calculations of metastable NH radicals in the decelerator and in the
trap-loading region. These simulations indicate that the width of the ﬁnal
velocity distribution of a packet of NH radicals transferred with a cw-laser to

the magnetic trap is realistically about a factor of 2.5 smaller than a pack-
age of molecules trapped with the pulsed loading scheme. As indicated in the
schematic description above, this reduction in the width of the velocity dis-
tribution is not the result of simply transferring only the slow molecules; no
molecules are lost during the transfer process. The reduced velocity spread
indicates a potential phase-space density increase of magnetically trapped NH
(X 3Σ−) radicals of more than one order of magnitude compared to the trap-
ping of NH (a 1∆) radicals in a pulsed electrostatic trap, for instance.

5 Conclusions

We have demonstrated the production of a pulsed, slow molecular beam of
metastable NH (a 1∆) radicals that is suited to be injected into a Stark decel-
erator. In a preliminary deceleration experiment, metastable NH radicals in
the J = 2, MΩ = −4 level have been decelerated from 550 m/s to 330 m/s,
e.g. two-thirds of the kinetic energy has been removed from these molecules.
In principle, the NH radicals can be decelerated to rest and conﬁned in an
electrostatic trap. When the NH (a 1∆) radicals are transferred to the X 3Σ−
ground state by inducing the A 3Π ← a 1∆ transition when the molecules
have come to rest, the ground-state NH radicals can be conﬁned near the
center of a magnetic trap. We have presented a possible scheme to increase
the phase-space density of the trapped packet of NH based on the use of a
cw-laser for the transfer from the a 1∆ state to the X 3Σ− state. Together with
our previously proposed scheme to accumulate NH radicals from subsequent
deceleration cycles in a magnetic trap, this oﬀers great prospects for further
Stark deceleration and magnetic trapping experiments.

(Submitted to Physical Review A)

We present a detailed quantum mechanical treatment of the photodetachment of

H− by a short laser pulse in the presence of crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

An exact analytic formula is presented for the ﬁnal state electron wave function (de-

scribing an electron in both static electric and magnetic ﬁelds and a short laser

pulse of arbitrary intensity). In the limit of a weak laser pulse, ﬁnal state electron

wave packet motion is examined and related to the closed classical electron orbits in

crossed static ﬁelds predicted by Peters and Delos [Phys. Rev. A 47, 3020 (1993)].

Owing to these closed orbit trajectories, we show that the detachment probability

can be modulated, depending on the time delay between two laser pulses and their

relative phase, thereby providing a means to partially control the photodetachment

process. In the limit of a long, weak pulse (i.e., a monochromatic radiation ﬁeld) our

results reduce to those of others; however, for this case we analyze the photodetach-

ment cross section numerically over a much larger range of electron kinetic energy

(i.e., up to 500 cm−1) than in previous studies and relate the detailed structures

both analytically and numerically to the above-mentioned, closed classical periodic

orbits.

INTRODUCTION

2

High resolution studies of atomic Rydberg states in the presence of external static electric

and magnetic ﬁelds have proved to be exceedingly fruitful for the investigation of atomic

dynamics because, owing to the large radial extent and weak binding of atomic Rydberg

levels, the eﬀects of external static ﬁelds are much more signiﬁcant for Rydberg levels than for

atomic ground or low-lying excited states [1]. Consequently for more than a quarter century

(up to the present) experimentalists and theorists have been investigating atomic Rydberg

spectra in external ﬁelds, including in particular the interesting case of crossed static electric

and magnetic ﬁelds [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,

24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. These latter investigations for the crossed

ﬁeld case include studies of motional Stark eﬀects on Rydberg atom spectra in a magnetic

ﬁeld [2], of novel, highly excited resonance states [3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 24], of circular

Rydberg states [9], of Rydberg wave packets in crossed ﬁelds [11, 13], of non-hydrogenic

signatures in Rydberg spectra [21, 23], of doubly-excited states in crossed ﬁelds [29], of

recurrence spectra [30, 31, 32], and of various aspects of electron dynamics in combined

Coulomb and crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds [1, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25, 26, 27,

28, 33, 34, 35, 36].

The related problem of photodetachment of a weakly bound electron (e.g., as in pho-

todetachment of a negative ion) in the presence of crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds

has been the subject of fewer investigations despite its having a comparably rich spectrum.

(Note that the weakly bound electron in a negative ion can simply decay, or become de-

tached, solely due to the presence of the external static electric and magnetic ﬁelds, a process

that has long been studied theoretically, as in, e.g., [37, 38].) Experimentally, crossed ﬁeld

eﬀects have been found to be signiﬁcant in photodetachment of negative ions in the presence

of a static magnetic ﬁeld owing to the inﬂuence of the motional electric ﬁeld experienced
by the detached electron [39, 40]. The photodetachment spectrum of H− in the presence of

crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds has been treated theoretically by Fabrikant [41]
and by Peters and Delos [42, 43]; a generalization to the case of photodetachment of H− in

the presence of static electric and magnetic ﬁelds of arbitrary orientation has been given by

Liu et al. [44, 45, 46]. In each of these works the static ﬁelds are assumed to be suﬃciently

weak that they do not aﬀect the relatively compact initial state. Fabrikant [41] gave the

3

ﬁrst quantum treatment of single photon detachment in crossed static electric and magnetic
ﬁelds using the zero-range potential model to describe the initial state of H−; rescattering

of the electron from the potential was also investigated, although the eﬀect was found to be

small except for high magnetic ﬁeld strengths. Peters and Delos [42] gave a semiclassical
analysis of H− photodetachment in crossed ﬁelds and correlated signiﬁcant features of the

spectrum with closed classical orbits. Subsequently they derived quantum formulas for this

process (using the zero-range potential model for the initial state) and exhibited the con-

nection to their predicted classical closed periodic orbits [43]. The generalization of Liu et

al. [44, 45, 46] to the case of static electric and magnetic ﬁelds of arbitrary orientation is also

based upon the zero-range potential model. In all of these works the electromagnetic ﬁeld

that causes photodetachment is assumed to be weak and monochromatic. Also, the pho-

todetachment spectrum is analyzed numerically only over a very small energy range above

threshold.

In this paper we consider detachment of H− by a short laser pulse in the presence of

crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds. We present an analytic expression for the ﬁnal

state of the detached electron taking into account exactly the eﬀects of the laser ﬁeld as well

as both static ﬁelds. The initial state is described by the solution of the zero-range potential,

as in all other quantum treatments to date [41, 43, 44, 45, 46]. We present also an analytic

expression for the photodetachment transition amplitude that can be used to describe the

probabilities of multiphoton detachment in crossed ﬁelds. In this paper, however, our focus

is on single photon detachment by short laser pulses and on the connection between the

detached electron wave packet motion and the predicted classical closed periodic orbits of

Peters and Delos [42]. As noted by Alber and Zoller [47] (in connection with electronic

wave packets in Rydberg atoms), such wave packets “provide a bridge between quantum

mechanics and the classical concept of the trajectory of a particle” and “the evolution

of these wave packets provides real-time observations of atomic or molecular dynamics.”

We show this connection for the case of short pulse laser-detached electron wave packets

in crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

In addition, we show analytically how our

short pulse results reduce to the quantum monochromatic ﬁeld results of Fabrikant [41]

and Peters and Delos [43] in the long pulse limit as well as the connection between our

analytic quantum formulation for the photodetachment spectrum and those features that

we associate with the predicted classical closed orbits [42]. Finally, we present numerical

4

results in the long pulse limit over a large energy range above the single photon detachment

threshold in order to demonstrate clearly these manifestations of classical behavior in our

predicted photodetachment spectrum.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec.

II we present our theoretical formulation
for detachment of H− by a short laser pulse in the presence of crossed static electric and

magnetic ﬁelds. In particular, in this section (with details given in an Appendix) we present

an exact, analytic expression for the wave function for an electron interacting with both the

laser pulse and the crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds. We present here also analytic

expressions for the transition probability amplitudes for both a single laser pulse and a double

laser pulse (i.e., two coherent single pulses separated by a time delay). In addition, the long

pulse (monochromatic ﬁeld) limit of our results is presented and this result is compared

with a number of prior works for various static ﬁeld cases.

In Sec.

III we establish the

connection between the long pulse limit of our results and the closed classical periodic orbits

predicted by Peters and Delos [42]. In Sec. IV we present our numerical results, starting ﬁrst

with a comparison with prior results for the long pulse (monochromatic ﬁeld) case and then

examining the short pulse case, including the ﬁnal state motion of the detached electron

wave packets.

II. THEORETICAL FORMULATION

We consider photodetachment of H− by one or more short laser pulses in the presence

of crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

In the ﬁnal state, we assume the detached

electron experiences only the laser and static ﬁelds; we ignore ﬁnal state interaction of the

electron with the residual hydrogen atom. For weak external ﬁelds, this is expected to be

a good approximation for this predominantly single photon process.
In this section, we
ﬁrst give the S-matrix transition amplitude for photodetachment of H−. Then we present

an exact quantum mechanical solution to the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for the

ﬁnal state of the detached electron in both the crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds

and the time dependent laser pulse. We then use this result together with S-matrix theory

to obtain detachment rates and cross sections. Atomic units are used throughout this paper

unless otherwise stated.

A. S-matrix Transition Amplitude for Photodetachment of H−

We adopt the Keldysh approximation for the ﬁnal-state, i.e., we neglect the binding

potential [48]. In this case, the S-matrix transition amplitude from the initial state ψi to

the ﬁnal state ψf is given by

Sf i =

where VI represents the laser-electron interaction and the bracket

over momentum space. For the zero range potential for which the bound state wave function
has the form e−κr/r, the S-matrix element in Eq. (1) can be shown to be gauge-invariant [49,

50]. Such a bound state wave function can be used to represent the weakly bound electron
of H−. We use that of Ohmura and Ohmura [51], which in momentum space is given by

B. The Final State Wave Function

In order to calculate the S-matrix transition amplitude in Eq. (3), we present in this

section an analytical expression for the ﬁnal state wave function ψf . As aforementioned,

we neglect the binding potential after detachment. Therefore, ψf is actually a Volkov-type

wave function that describes a free electron moving in the combined ﬁeld of the crossed

static electric and magnetic ﬁelds and the time-dependent electric ﬁeld associated with the

short laser pulse. In Fig. 1 we illustrate the conﬁguration of the external ﬁelds in which the

detached electron moves: the uniform static magnetic ﬁeld deﬁnes the x axis and the static

electric ﬁeld deﬁnes the z axis, i.e.,

B = Bˆi

ES = ES ˆk.

the laser and the static electric ﬁelds point along the z-axis. As indicated, the drift motion of the

detached electron is along the y-axis.

We assume that each laser pulse has the following general form,

EL(t) = E0e−α2(t−τ )2

sin (ωt + β) ˆk,

where ω is the laser frequency, τ is the time delay with respect to t = 0, and β is a

(generally constant) phase. The duration of the laser pulse is deﬁned to be the full width

at half maximum (FWHM) of the laser intensity, and is given by

Tp = √2 ln 2/α.

C. S-matrix Amplitude for Photodetachment of H−

In order to examine the motion of the detached electron wave packet in crossed E and B

ﬁelds, we deﬁne in analogy to Eq. (23) of Ref. [55] a time-dependent transition amplitude

Rf i(t) from the initial state to the ﬁnal state (kx, ky, nz):

In principle, with this analytical S-matrix amplitude one can readily calculate the total
and multiphoton transition rates, as done for H− detachment in a static electric ﬁeld in

Ref. [50]. However, in the present paper, we restrict our consideration to the one-photon

detachment process (Note that there are still many cycles in the laser pulses that we will

consider in this work). Our analytical results facilitate easy comparison with some other

previous results. Consequently, we evaluate Eq. (29) only to ﬁrst order in the laser electric

ﬁeld strength E0, i.e., we employ the following approximations:

E. S-matrix and Wave Packet Amplitudes for the Double Pulse Case

We consider here the case that there are two laser pulses of the form of Eq. (6), with the

second one delayed with respect to the ﬁrst by a time interval τ and having a relative phase

of β, i.e.,

For an inﬁnitely long, monochromatic beam, the probability P is proportional to time, t. In

this case, it does not make sense to talk about the total transition probability. Instead, one

normally considers the total transition rate, W , which is given by [48]

W = lim
t→∞

1
t

P.

σpw =

W
F

,

The total photodetachment cross section is obtained by dividing the total photodetachment

rate W by the photon ﬂux F (the number of photons per unit area per unit time):

where ‘pw’ stands for the monochromatic plane wave case.

For the short laser pulse case, it does not make sense to talk about a transition rate since

the transition probability is not simply proportional to time t. In addition, the photon ﬂux

F is not well deﬁned. Nevertheless, it is possible to renormalize the total probability for

detachment by a short laser pulse in such a way that the renormalized probability reduces,

in the limit of an inﬁnitely long pulse, to the usual formula for the photodetachment cross

section. Since the renormalized probability will have the dimensions of area, we denote

it as an eﬀective photodetachment cross section, σ. To derive this eﬀective cross section,

one uses the time duration of the laser pulse as the unit of time. One calculates the total

photodetachment probability P during the laser pulse duration and the total number of

photons per unit area (i.e., the photon density), Σ, during the laser pulse duration. Then

an eﬀective photodetachment cross section, σ, may be deﬁned as

σ =

P
Σ

.

(50)

Clearly σ deﬁned in this way has the dimensions of a cross section. In the rest of this paper,

σ should be understood to be this eﬀective photodetachment cross section, i.e., calculated

according to Eq. (50). We shall show below that this σ for the short laser pulse case

reduces in the limit α

0 (cf. Eq. (6)) to the usual photodetachment cross section for a

monochromatic plane wave.

It has been shown by Wang and Starace [55] that for a single Gaussian pulse deﬁned by

Eq. (6) with τ = β = 0, the photon density Σ is given by the following formula:

We note that our weak magnetic ﬁeld result in Eq. (63) agrees with the formula of Peters

and Delos (see Eqs. (3.6) and (3.7a) of Ref. [43]). Eq. (63) agrees also with Fabrikant’s

result (see Eq. (53) of Ref. [41]) except for the extra term in his formula that accounts for

ﬁnal-state interaction of the electron with the atomic residue.

III. CONNECTIONS TO CLASSICAL CLOSED ORBITS

In the previous section we have derived a general quantum mechanical expression for
the (eﬀective) photodetachment cross section for H− by a short laser pulse in the presence

of crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds. We have also shown that our plane wave

limit result (given by Eq. (62)) reduces for the limiting cases of weak static magnetic (cf.

Eq. (63)) or weak static electric (cf. Eq. (66)) ﬁelds to known results of others. Magnetic ﬁeld

strengths, B, that are readily available at present in the laboratory are weak in the sense that
they satisfy the relation, ωc ≪
cross section in the plane wave limit given in Eq. (63) is of great interest owing to the

ω. Therefore the quantum result for the photodetachment

possibility of experimental measurements with currently available technology. In this section

we analyze this equation for the purpose of making connection with the classical closed orbits

analyzed by Peters and Delos [42]. This connection will prove useful for interpreting some

of the numerical predictions presented in the next section.

For ω

ωc, the detached electron energy lies in the region of large nz. In this limit the

≫

integrand in Eq. (63) becomes highly oscillatory, as may be seen by considering the large nz

Owing to the fact that nz is large, the phase function S(nz, η) changes signiﬁcantly as η

the expression for ˜ζky obtained from the energy conservation condition, εf i −

which can be rewritten, in terms of scaled energies, as

and return times, given by Eqs. (86) and (88).

Actually, each boundary energy deﬁnes the onset of large oscillations in the cross section.

However, the largest amplitude oscillation in the cross section occurs at a slightly higher

energy at which a diﬀerent type of closed orbit occurs that has a truly circular motion in

the drift frame in the y-z plane. The energy of this orbit may be obtained by setting the

initial momentum along the y axis equal to the drift velocity, i.e.,

for which for an electron is ejected along the static ﬁeld direction and reﬂected by the static

electric ﬁeld such that its return time satisﬁes Tret = jTB. In the parallel ﬁelds case, the

motion in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld is simply cyclotron motion with

period TB. Classical closed orbits having a return time equal to an integer multiple of TB

are associated with the largest oscillations in the cross section [59].

In the crossed ﬁelds case, however, the situation is much more complicated. However,

since εz (cf. Eq. (79)) is conserved, when the detached electron has an initial momentum

p0
y given by Eq. (90) (and an initial position z = 0), the initial momentum along the z

axis takes its maximum value. This implies that this particular closed orbit starts out (in

the drift frame) aligned with the laser polarization direction. These circular orbits (in the

drift frame), having energies given by Eq. (92), are associated with the largest amplitude

oscillation of the cross section.

a much larger energy range than in prior works [41, 42, 43]. This large range allows us to

demonstrate very clearly the signatures of the predicted classical closed orbits [42], both in

the energy spectrum and in the time (i.e., Fourier transform) spectrum. We examine next

the short laser pulse case, demonstrating ﬁrst the eﬀects of laser pulse duration on the pho-

todetachment cross section. We then examine the detached electron wave packet dynamics

in the y-z plane and the possibility of modulating the detachment cross section by pump

probe (Ramsey interference) techniques. The connection between the time development of

the quantum wave packet of the detached electron and the predicted classical closed orbits

is also discussed.

A. Photodetachment Cross Section in the Plane Wave Limit

1. Static Electric Field Dependence for Near Threshold Energies

In Figs. 2 and 3 we present the photodetachment cross section for H − for a static magnetic

ﬁeld, B = 1 T, and six diﬀerent values of the static electric ﬁeld, ES. Our quantum theory

predictions are obtained from the plane wave limit result given in Eq. (62). One sees in Fig. 2

that, as noted by Fabrikant [41], even a very small static electric ﬁeld removes the known

singularity in the detachment cross section for energies corresponding to integer multiples

of the cyclotron frequency in the pure magnetic ﬁeld case (see, e.g., [57]). In particular, for

ES = 0.5 V/cm, the behavior of the cross section is very similar to that of the pure magnetic

ﬁeld case [57] (to which our results reduce in the limit of zero static electric ﬁeld, as shown in

Sec. II.F.1(b) above), but without the cyclotron singularities. On the other hand, beginning

with ES = 7 V/cm, the oscillatory modulation of the cross section by the static electric ﬁeld

becomes obvious. As shown in Fig. 3 the frequency of this modulation decreases as the static

electric ﬁeld magnitude increases, just as is found for the case of a pure static electric ﬁeld

or for the case of parallel static magnetic and electric ﬁelds (see, e.g., [55]). One sees also

that the cross section becomes non-zero at the zero-ﬁeld threshold owing to the lowering of

the threshold by the static electric ﬁeld. For the present crossed static magnetic and electric

ﬁeld case, the modulation of the cross section becomes increasingly complex the higher the

maximum total energy Ef becomes. For a maximum detached electron kinetic energy of 30
cm−1, Fig. 4 shows that the oscillatory modulations diﬀer above and below approximately
15 cm−1. For energies below 15 cm−1, there exists only a sinusoidal modulation. Above
about 15 cm−1, the modulation consists of more than one frequency and becomes more

complicated the higher in energy one looks.

the oscillatory modulations of the cross section become increasingly dense and complex

as the total energy increases, we see also that clear patterns in the spectra emerge and

become more obvious the higher in energy we look. The onset of these repetitive patterns

is indicated in each panel by the vertical dotted lines, which represent the locations of the

boundary energies [42] deﬁned by Eq. (89). The peak amplitudes are indicated by the open

triangles at the energies deﬁned by Eq. (92), which correspond to the locations of circular

classical orbits in the drift frame. The connection of these classical closed orbits and our

quantum mechanical cross sections can be most easily investigated in the time domain, which

we consider next.

that at the lowest maximum energy, only one peak appears in the time spectrum. The

peak position indicates the return time (i.e., orbit period) of a closed classical orbit having
an energy of 10.98 cm−1. As Emax
increases to 15.91 cm−1 in (b), another peak emerges.

This corresponds to the ﬁrst classical boundary energy (cf. Eq. (89)) for j = 1. Unlike

the case of classical dynamics, however, where the boundary energy is sharply deﬁned, our

calculations indicate that the second peak in Fig. 6(b) begins to appear around the energy
13.5 cm−1. Note also that the ﬁrst peak in (b) shifts to the right as compared to that in

(a). This indicates that the return time of the ﬁrst closed orbit increases when the total

energy increases. In panel (c) we observe that the second peak increases in magnitude while

the ﬁrst peak decreases in magnitude.

The serrated U-shaped region between the left and right boundaries of the split second peak

correspond to the return times of the two bifurcated orbits for lower total energies (e.g.,
such as those two shown in panel (d) for a total energy of 21.97 cm−1). Finally, in panel (f)

for a slightly higher total energy we observe that the third peak grows in magnitude relative

to the ﬁrst and second (split) peaks.

given by Eq. (92). The Fourier transform spectrum for energies in the range from 0 - 500

the range from 400 - 500 cm−1 is shown in Fig. 7(b). In (a), the open circles denote the

return times (periods) of the 15 closed classical orbit solutions of Eq. (86) that exist for a
total energy of 500 cm−1. These periods are calculated using Eq. (88) and the results are

given in Table I together with the corresponding orbit energies. (Note that for each j > 0

and for a total energy E not equal to one of the boundary energies given by Eq. (89), Eq. (86)

has two solutions.) The open triangles, on the other hand, correspond to the circular orbits

in the drift frame corresponding to the local maximum amplitudes of the oscillatory part of

the cross section; their return times are given by the very simple Eq. (93).

Note that the bowl-like structures appearing in Fig. 7(a) above each open triangle result

from the fact that closed orbits have diﬀerent return times for each diﬀerent total energy and

from the fact that the Fourier transform spectrum in this ﬁgure results from a large range
of total energies, i.e., from 0 to 500 cm−1. When we calculate the Fourier transform of the
oscillatory part of the cross section over only the limited energy range, 400 cm−1

500 cm−1, as in Fig. 7(b), then we observe that the ﬁrst 13 peaks are approximately located

calculated for a maximum total energy of 500 cm−1. The energy region 0

the cross section becomes larger as the total energy increases.

B. Detachment by Short Laser Pulses

Photodetachment by means of one or more short laser pulses diﬀers from that by a

monochromatic laser. Most obviously, the pulse bandwidth aﬀects the measured spectrum

of detached electrons. In addition, short laser pulses produce localized detached electron

wave packets whose motion in crossed ﬁelds can be investigated and compared to classical

predictions [47, 64, 65]. Most interesting, perhaps, is the possibility of controlling the

modulation of the detachment spectrum by variation of the parameters of one or more laser

pulses. In the rest of this section, we examine each of these topics in turn for the crossed

static electric and magnetic ﬁeld case.

We note ﬁrst, however, several previous works on related problems. Ramsey interference
eﬀects resulting from photodetachment of H− by two short, coherent laser pulses as a function

of their relative phase was examined by Wang and Starace for the case of a static electric

ﬁeld [61] and the case of parallel static electric and magnetic ﬁelds [55]. The latter work [55]

showed that a large modulation of the eﬀective detachment probability can be achieved by

optimizing the static ﬁeld magnitudes and the time delay between laser pulses, as follows:

the ﬁeld magnitudes should be such that the classical time for reﬂection of an electron back

to the origin by the static electric ﬁeld equals an integer multiple of the harmonic oscillator

period for electron motion in the static magnetic ﬁeld; also, the time delay of the second

pulse should coincide with the classical time for the electron’s return to the origin. For
the case of a single short laser pulse, Du [62] examined the photodetachment of H− in the

presence of a static electric ﬁeld using modiﬁed closed orbit formulas. He showed that when

the laser pulse duration is shorter than particular closed orbit periods, then those orbits no

longer contribute to the photodetachment spectrum. Finally, Zhao et al. [63] have derived

a uniform semiclassical formula for the photodetachment cross section of a negative ion by

a short laser pulse for the case of parallel static electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

1. Pulse Duration Eﬀects

The fundamental diﬀerence between using a short laser pulse and using a continuous

(monochromatic) laser is the bandwidth of the short laser pulse. In the former case, the

laser pulse will excite a group of ﬁnal states that form an electron wave packet, whereas

in the latter case only a well-deﬁned ﬁnal state will be reached.

In our present case of

detachment in the presence of crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds, the spacing of

31

Landau levels is very small (0.93 cm−1 for B = 1 T), so that one expects that even a quite

long pulse having a duration of several picoseconds will have considerable ﬁnite bandwidth

eﬀects on the detached electron wave packet and its dynamics.

In Fig. 8, we present the eﬀective total cross section (cf. Eq. (53)) for a laser pulse of the

form (6) (with τ = β = 0) and four diﬀerent pulse durations (cf. Eq. (7)) in the presence

of crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds of magnitudes ES = 15 V/cm and B = 1 T.

As we see from Fig. 8, for the longest pulse duration, 240 ps, the eﬀective cross section is

identical with that for a (monochromatic) plane wave. As the pulse duration decreases, the

modulation of the cross section is suppressed, beginning at the highest energies shown and

progressing to structures at lower energies. Thus, when the pulse duration is reduced to 45
ps, the modulation structure beyond the energy 2.3 cm−1 is largely suppressed. As the pulse
duration is further reduced to 30 ps, even the modulation between 1 and 2 cm−1 decreases

in magnitude. At the shortest pulse duration, 15 ps, the oscillatory structure completely

disappears and the eﬀective cross section becomes a smooth curve passing through the

oscillatory cross sections for longer pulse durations. In this case, the cross section is nearly

identical to the one for detachment by a continuous (monochromatic) laser in the absence

of any external static ﬁelds, as shown by the dotted line in Fig. 8. The major diﬀerence

between these cases occurs near the threshold: our short pulse eﬀective cross section is ﬁnite

at the zero static ﬁeld threshold, while the monochromatic ﬁeld cross section, in accordance

with Wigner’s threshold law, is zero at threshold. This diﬀerence is due to the lowering of

the detachment threshold by the static electric ﬁeld.

It is interesting to relate these changes in the structure of the eﬀective detachment cross

sections as a function of pulse duration to the energy positions of the known classical closed
orbits [42, 43]. For the maximum energy 2.7 cm−1 considered here, there are three closed

orbits available for the static ﬁeld parameters we employ. These three orbits have return
times (periods) of 30.69, 40.94 and 60.72 ps. As the energy decreases to 1.8 cm−1, the

return times decrease to 28.94, 43.32 and 56.19 ps respectively. As the energy is further
decreased to 1 cm−1, there are only two closed orbits having return times of 26.95 and 48.58

ps respectively. We observe in Fig. 8 that as the laser pulse durations become shorter than

the closed orbit periods, the structure of the eﬀective cross section is reduced. In particular,

for the shortest pulse duration, 15 ps, which is smaller than any closed orbit period, all

structure has disappeared.

and magnetic ﬁeld strengths are 60 V/cm and 1 T respectively. The laser pulse duration is Tp = 2
ps and t = 0 corresponds to the end of this pulse. The total electron energy is Ef = 8 cm−1.

2. Wave packet dynamics

We examine here the dynamics of a detached electron wave packet produced by a short

laser pulse under the inﬂuence of crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds. As discussed

in Refs. [42, 43], the oscillatory part of the photodetachment cross section produced by a

monochromatic laser ﬁeld may be associated with those closed orbits that exist for a given

value of the photon energy. As discussed in the previous section, the oscillatory part of the

eﬀective cross section produced by a short laser pulse is suppressed when the pulse duration

is smaller than the classical orbit periods of those orbits that exist at the energy being

considered. (See [62] for the related pure static electric ﬁeld case.) From the correspondence

33

FIG. 10: (color online). Same as Fig. 9 but for a total detached electron energy of Ef = 15.9 cm−1.

between classical and quantum mechanics, we expect to observe that the detached electron

wave packets produced by short laser pulses will trace the paths of allowed classical closed

orbits.

In order to illustrate the quantum wave packet motion corresponding to the classical dy-

namics, we shall only consider two-dimensional quantum motion by imposing the restriction

px = 0. As discussed above, the x component of the momentum has to be zero in order

for there to be any closed orbits. In this case, the time-dependent electron wave packet in

coordinate space is given by

which is the Fourier transform of Eq. (40), taking px = 0. A similar Fourier transform can

be employed for the double pulse case in Eq. (45).

In Figs. 9-11 we present snapshots of the detached electron wave packet for the case of

a single laser pulse of the form (6) with pulse duration Tp = 2 ps. The time evolution

starts from t0 =

Tp. The static electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths are taken to be 60

−

V/cm and 1 T respectively in all cases. Note that the cyclotron period is TB = 35.72 ps for
B = 1 T. In Fig. 9, we take the total energy Ef to be 8 cm−1. There is only one classical

closed orbit for this energy and these static ﬁeld parameters. The return time of the closed

orbit is calculated to be T 0

ret = 24.1 ps (0.674 TB). In Fig. 9(a), we see that two electron

wave packets are created at the peak intensity of the laser pulse on either side of the z = 0

axis, which correspond to electrons being ejected either along or opposite to the direction

of increasing static electric ﬁeld, ES (cf. Fig. 1). After the end of the pulse in (b), the two

electron wave packets move apart. However, as time increases we see in (c) that both wave

packets are turned back by the external magnetic ﬁeld. As shown in (c) and (d), each wave

packet undergoes considerable spatial spreading. The most interesting plot is shown in (e),

where we see a large portion of the left hand wave packet sweep through the residual core

(at the origin). We note that the time corresponding to this snapshot is exactly the return

time of the only classical closed orbit in the present case. It is return of this piece of the

wave packet that leads to the regular sinusoidal oscillation one sees in Fig. 5(a) below 15.9
cm−1. As the time approaches 1 TB in (f), we see that the two wave packets refocus on the

the atomic core at the origin).

positive y axis (the direction of drift motion) and that they pass through each other and

continue their rotational motion during the next cyclotron period. However, owing to the

drift motion along the y-axis, we see in (h) that the left hand wave packet is no longer able

to return to the atomic core in the second cyclotron cycle for this total energy. The two

wave packets do refocus further along the positive y-axis again at 2 TB, as shown in (i).

We note that the refocusing and the drift of the electron wave packets are exactly anal-

ogous to the classical dynamics discussed by Peters and Delos in [42]. They showed that

classical orbits with diﬀerent initial conditions will refocus at various points along the drift

axis. We note also that pump-probe experimental studies of the related problem of the

motion of pump-laser-produced Rydberg-state electron wave packets in the Rubidium atom

in the presence of crossed ﬁelds have found enhancements of probe laser-produced ionization

signals when the delay of the probe laser equals the orbital period of the appropriate closed

classical orbit for this related problem [13].

We present similar snapshots in time for the increased energy of 15.9 cm−1 in Fig. 10. At

this energy, the ﬁrst so-called boundary orbit [42] may be populated (cf. Eq. (89) for j = 1).

There are thus two classical closed orbits that exist at this total energy, whose return times

are 27.4 ps (0.766 TB) and 48.8 ps (1.366 TB). In Figs. 10(e) and 10(g) we see that diﬀerent

parts of the quantum electron wave packet return to the atomic core at these two times. The

most distinctive feature of the part of the electron wave packet that returns to the origin

at approximately 49 ps (cf. Fig. 10(g)) (which corresponds to the higher energy, classical

boundary orbit) is that most of the arc in (g) passes through the atomic core at the origin

(which we have conﬁrmed by observing the motion of the electron wave packet on a ﬁner

time scale). We note also that the energy of the classical boundary orbit corresponds to the

abruptly increased amplitude of the oscillatory part of the cross section seen in Fig. 5(a)
around the energy location 15.9 cm−1 indicated by the ﬁrst dashed line.

The fact that electron wave packet amplitudes return to the region of the atomic core

implies the possibility of modulating the detachment cross section, analogously to the case

35

of a monochromatic laser, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. However, the present wave packet

studies show why for the crossed ﬁeld case the modulation of the cross section is very small.

Consider the three dimensional wave packet snapshots in Fig. 11, which are calculated for

times corresponding to those in Figs. 10(e), (f), (g), and (h). Owing to the spreading of the

electron wave packet, when it returns to the origin the part of the wave packet that overlaps

the origin is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than the probability in (f), in which

the wave packet re-focuses along the drift axis, i.e., away from the origin. Because of such

wave packet spreading and drift away from the origin, modulation of the photodetachment

cross section in the crossed static ﬁeld case is necessarily small. For similar reasons, the use

of short pulse, pump-probe type techniques to control the photodetachment cross section in

the crossed static ﬁeld case also results in only small modulations of the cross section, as we

discuss next.

3. Pump-Probe Coherent Control of the Eﬀective Photodetachment Cross Section Using Short

Laser Pulses

The idea of using laser pulses shorter than electron wave packet orbital periods to control

electron wave packet motion was initially formulated theoretically for Rydberg (i.e., bound)

electron wave packets [66]. This idea was extended theoretically to photodetached (i.e.,

continuum) electron wave packets in the presence of external static ﬁelds, including static

electric [61] and parallel static electric and magnetic [55] ﬁelds. Experimentally, short pulse,
pump-probe studies of photodetachment of O− in the presence of a static magnetic ﬁeld

demonstrated Ramsey interference between photodetached electron wave packets [40]. Such

Ramsey interference may also be demonstrated in the present crossed electric and magnetic

ﬁeld case.

In Fig. 12 we present the eﬀective total photodetachment cross section (cf. Eq. (67)) as a

function of the relative phase β and the time delay τ between two laser pulses (cf. Eq (41))
for a total detached electron energy of 15.9 cm−1 and for ES = 60 V/cm and B = 1 T.

The pulse duration Tp of both pulses is taken to be 4 ps. Fig. 12(a) shows the dependence

of the eﬀective cross section on the relative phase, β, for six time delays, τ , between the

pulses. One observes that the modulations of the cross section have local maxima for time
delays of 0.77 TB (≅ 27.5 ps) and 1.37 TB (≅ 49 ps), which are precisely the return times

of the two allowed classical closed orbits for a total electron energy of 15.9 cm−1. However,

the modulation of the cross section for the larger time delay is much greater than for the

smaller time delay, which is consistent with the extent of electron wave packet overlap with

the origin shown in Figs. 10(e) and (g). In other words, in the latter case a large portion

of the wave packet passes over the origin, which makes the Ramsey interference with the

newly produced wave packet amplitude (due to the second pulse) of greater amplitude.

Fig. 12(b) shows the dependence of the eﬀective cross section on the time delay, τ , for

two relative phases, β, between the pulses: 0 and 1 π. Fig. 12(b) clearly shows that the

maxima and minima in the eﬀective cross section as a function of the time delay between
the pulses occur for time delays of 0.77 TB (≅ 27.5 ps) and 1.37 TB (≅ 49 ps), which are

the orbital periods of the two allowed classical closed orbits. We see once again that the

modulation of the eﬀective cross section is much larger for the classical closed orbit having

the larger time delay, as explained above.

V. CONCLUSIONS

37

In this paper we have presented a detailed quantum mechanical analysis of detachment

of a weakly bound electron by a short laser pulse in the presence of crossed static electric

and magnetic ﬁelds. For speciﬁcity, we have chosen the parameters of the initial state of
the weakly bound electron as those appropriate for the outer electron in H−. In particular

we have presented an analytic expression for the ﬁnal state electron wave function, i.e., the

wave function for an electron moving in the ﬁeld of a laser pulse of arbitrary intensity as

well as in crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds of arbitrary strengths. The general

detachment probability formulas we present may therefore be used to analyze multiphoton

detachment in crossed ﬁelds (although we have not presented this analysis here, but instead

have focused on the weak laser ﬁeld case).

Based upon our analytic results for the detachment probability by a short laser pulse,

we have deﬁned an eﬀective detachment cross section for the short pulse case that is shown

to reduce, in the long pulse limit to results of others for the monochromatic, plane wave

case. Our eﬀective cross section formula allows us to demonstrate the eﬀects of the laser

pulse duration, such as, e.g., that for pulse durations shorter than the period of a particular

classical closed orbit, the features of that closed orbit in the photodetachment spectrum (for

the plane wave case) will simply vanish. By means of a stationary phase analysis, we have

derived a condition for the existence of closed classical orbits that agrees exactly with that

obtained by Peters and Delos by a purely classical analysis [42]. We have also illustrated the

bifurcation of the closed classical orbits at the so-called boundary energies [42] by Fourier

transforming the oscillatory part of our quantum cross section (in the long pulse limit) over

various ranges of the ﬁnal state electron energy.

Finally, our analysis of the motion of detached electron wave packets produced by a

short laser pulse provides a direct comparison of quantum and classical features for the

crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁeld problem. We ﬁnd that the dynamics of our two-

dimensional detached electron wave packets are consistent with the predictions of closed

classical orbit theory [42]. We have also shown that wave packet spreading and the fact that

wave packet refocusing only occurs at the origin in the drift frame means that control of

electron detachment in crossed static ﬁelds by means of laser pulses is less eﬀective than in

the parallel static electric and magnetic ﬁeld case [55].

3. Long Pulse Approximation for ξ(t)

In the long pulse case (in which α/ω

1), simpliﬁed expressions can be obtained for the

≪

integrals Ii(t) in a way similar that used in Ref. [55]. For example, starting from Eq. (B9) one

can expand the sine function in terms of exponentials and then do the resulting integration

by parts, dropping terms that are of order α/ω or higher, as follows:

In a similar way one may obtain the following approximate expressions for I2(t) and I0(t):

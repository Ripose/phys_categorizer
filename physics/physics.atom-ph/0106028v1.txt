Magneto-optic and magnetostatic trapping is realized near
a surface using current carrying coils wrapped around mag-
netizable cores. A cloud of 107 Cesium atoms is created
with currents less than 50 mA. Ramping up the current while
maintaining optical dissipation leads to tightly conﬁned atom
clouds with an aspect ratio of 1:1000. We study the 3D char-
acter of the magnetic potential and characterize atom number
and density as a function of the applied current. The ﬁeld gra-
dient in the transverse dimension has been varied from < 10
G/cm to > 1 kG/cm. By loading and cooling atoms in-situ,
we have eliminated the problem of coupling from a MOT into
a smaller phase space.

Encouraged by the recent successful demonstration of
Bose Einstein condensation in atomic vapors, and the
macroscopic coherence properties of this new state of
matter, many groups are pursuing the integration of sev-
eral complex atom-optical devices on a single substrate
[1–5]. Atomic waveguides are likely to be a building
block of such atom-optic devices. Magnetic waveguides
for atoms have been demonstrated, conﬁning weak ﬁeld
seeking atoms in a local magnetic ﬁeld minimum. Most
guides are based on current carrying wires, either sus-
pended in free space [6,7], embedded in a tube [8,9] or
lithographically patterned on a substrate [2,3,10].

In this paper, we describe a new approach to create
magnetic waveguides that transport neutral atoms above
the surface of a substrate, by exploiting magnetic mate-
rials poled by time dependent currents. This approach
has several major advantages over systems that simply
use current carrying wires to create the waveguides.

Firstly, the capture volume for collecting atoms from
the background vapor can be much larger. For a typical
gradient of 10 G/cm, the capture volume for a wire-based
guide is about 10−4 cm2 times the length of the guide. In
contrast, the ferromagnetic structures used in our exper-
iment have capture volumes of around 1 cm2 times the
length. This is due to the diﬀerent range of the magnetic
potential determined by the size of the structure, 100 µm
for the wire-based traps and 1 cm in our case. The large
capture volume has allowed us to trap a large number of
atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) using the same
quadrupole ﬁeld that will be used to form the magnetic
waveguide. We transfer the atoms from the MOT into
the waveguide by ramping the magnetic ﬁeld by around
3 orders of magnitude to produce a very high gradient
waveguide at the same position as the initial MOT [11]

1

with the transferred atoms remaining cold in all three
dimensions. Since all the atoms are loaded in situ, the
transfer between the low and high gradient waveguides
can be made very eﬃcient. Thus we avoid the more tradi-
tional process of dropping or pushing atoms into a tightly
conﬁned waveguide which results in ineﬃcient transfer
and increase in temperature.

Secondly, the large distance of the center of the waveg-
uide from the surface allows us to protect the atoms from
heating due to interactions between the atoms and the
surface [12]. Moreover, the high ﬁeld gradients result in a
transverse width of the atom cloud which is much smaller
than the distance from the surface. This inhibits losses
due to collisions with the surface [1]. Also, any inhomo-
geneities in the magnetic ﬁeld due to small imperfections
on the surface of the ferromagnetic foils are smoothed
out at the location of the waveguide.

Thirdly, the ampliﬁcation of the magnetic ﬁeld by the
ferromagnetic foils implies a smaller current is required
to generate a given peak magnetic ﬁeld. This results in
greatly reduced ohmic heating. In our setup, the ferro-
magnetic cores amplify the ﬁeld due to the wires typically
by a factor of 50. Thus, the initial gradient of around 7
G/cm for the MOT was realized by running less than 50
mA around the ferromagnetic cores. We have achieved
gradients on the order of 1 kG/cm and trap depths of
more than 100 G with less than 100 W of dissipation.
This reduced heating is important since one of the modes
of failure of previous devices based on current carrying
wires was the fusing of wires due to local heating when
running currents of a few amperes [13].

Finally, these structures permit much larger ﬁeld gra-
dients and trap depths than can be obtained in systems
using only current carrying wires. The peak ﬁeld at the
surface of a ferromagnetic core that is fully poled is equal
to the saturation ﬁeld of that material which ranges from
around 4 kG to 20 kG [14]. Steep magnetic traps can
be formed by using ferromagnetic structures of suitably
small size [15,16]. This results in a larger compression of
the atoms from the initial MOT, leading to higher densi-
ties and improved collision rates for evaporative cooling.
Also, the large gradients imply tighter conﬁnement and
larger ground state energies and mode spacings. More-
over, this would enable us to guide the conﬁned atoms
in tight loops permitting the fabrication of reciprocal
atom interferometers with large enclosed areas and small
length [17,18]. For instance, our demonstrated gradient
of 1 kG/cm would allow us to transport atoms moving
at 1 m/s around a loop of radius 6 mm giving an inter-

ferometer with an enclosed area larger than 1 cm2.

experimentally achieved 1D magnetic traps with trans-
verse mode spacings of around 10 kHz (0.5 µK) and
ground state sizes less than 50 nm. The large aspect
ratio (1:1000) of the eventual magnetostatic trap real-
ized in our experiment makes this system an attractive
candidate for investigation of the Tonk’s gas regime [19].
Similar structures of smaller size, made with ferromag-
netic materials of larger saturation ﬁelds, should permit
gradients of 107 G/cm. The conﬁguration described in
this work can also be used to split a waveguide in the
transverse dimension with the aid of an external bias
ﬁeld.

A schematic of the experimental setup is shown in
Fig.1. Two pairs of ferromagnetic foils (80% Ni, 15.5%
Fe, 4.5% Mo) are mounted on a rigid platform at sepa-
rations of 1 mm. Both pairs of foils are 0.5 mm thick
and 5 cm long along the long axis. The inner pair of
foils is cut to a height of 1 cm while the outer pair is cut
to a height of 2.5 cm. Thin kapton insulated wires are
wound around these foils with 9 turns around the inner
pair and 25 turns around the outer pair. Depending on
the sense of the current around each foil, the foils can be
individually magnetized in one of two directions.

where I is the current around the ferromagnetic foils,
N the number of windings and z the height above the
surface. l, s and w are the height of the foils, separation
between the pair of foils and the thickness of each foil
respectively. The dimensionless constant c0 depends on
the geometry and material of the ferromagnetic foils and
is experimentally found to be around 50.

Due to the geometry of these foils, the potential is very
shallow along the long (waveguide) axis and the magnetic
trap has a large aspect ratio. A pair of trapping beams
perpendicular to the long axis of the waveguide is re-
ﬂected oﬀ a gold coated mirror at an angle of 45◦. This
mirror is glued to the surface of the foils as indicated in
Fig.1. Another pair of counterpropagating laser beams
grazes the mirror surface along the long axis of the guide.
This geometry is similar to a mirror MOT [1] but in this
case, the quadrupole ﬁelds are generated by the ferromag-
netic foils underneath the mirror. Additionally, changing
the polarization of the laser beams along the guide does
not signiﬁcantly change the number of trapped atoms in-
dicating that the atoms are damped but not trapped in
this dimension. The length of the cloud along the waveg-
uide is limited by the waist of the laser beam and equals
1 cm in our case. We emphasize that the MOT in which
the atoms are initially loaded and cooled is at the same
location as the magnetic waveguide into which the atoms
are eventually loaded and compressed.

It is important to characterize the ﬁelds generated by
the ferromagnetic foils as a function of the current and
the height above the surface. This was done by two in-
dependent methods.

In the ﬁrst method, the ﬁelds due to the inner and
outer pair of foils were determined with a calibrated com-
mercial tape head on a micrometer translation stage. The
measurements were performed by running ac currents of
10 mA at a frequency of 150 Hz around the foils. It was
veriﬁed that the pickup voltage does not depend on the
ac frequency. These measurements are shown in Fig.1(b).
The calculations in Fig.1(c) show that the gradient can
be increased while keeping the trap minimum at the same
height above the surface.

Next, the system was placed in a UHV chamber
pumped to a typical pressure of 5 × 10−9 mbar. Cur-
rents of up to 1A were run around either the inner or
the outer pair of foils. By cancelling these ﬁelds at the
plane of symmetry with an external horizontal ﬁeld of
known magnitude, magneto-optic traps were created at
diﬀerent heights above the surface. At the position of
the cloud, the magnitude of the bias ﬁeld is equal to that
of the ferromagnetic foils, by construction. Therefore,
this constitutes an alternative calibration of the ﬁeld as

a function of distance to the surface. This measurement
using cold atoms shows good agreement with the data in
Fig.1(b).

Using an external bias ﬁeld does not exploit the ben-
eﬁts of the ferromagnetic materials and imposes a limit
on the maximum gradient that can obtained. However,
MOTs can also be formed by exclusively running cur-
rents around the inner and outer pair of foils, without
any external bias ﬁeld. By using the outer pair of ferro-
magnetic foils to provide the cancelling ﬁeld, waveguides
with larger gradients and trap depths can be realized.
Also, the waveguide can be formed without an exter-
nal ﬁeld. When Iinner and Iouter are increased by the
same factor γ, the gradient should increase by γ with-
out changing the height of the trap as shown in Fig.1(c).
To verify this, we have measured the height of the atom
cloud above the surface and plotted the results in Fig.2.
In this experiment, the ratio Iouter/Iinner were 1/3, 1/2
and 3/4 corresponding to heights of 1.5 mm, 1.1 mm and
0.8 mm respectively. This is in agreement with the pre-
vious calibration.

gated the width of the cloud in the magnetostatic trap.
In this case, the laser beams were switched oﬀ 3 ms after
ramping the currents. After a dark period of 100 ms,
the MOT beams were switched on to image the cloud for
6 ms. For adiabatic compression, we expect the width
to scale as b−1/3 for a linear potential and b−1/4 for a
harmonic potential. However, assuming that the MOT
beams cool the cloud to its initial temperature, the width
should scale as b−1 for a linear potential. As indicated by
the dotted line in Fig.3, this is the case in the regime 10
< b < 200 G/cm. Above 200 G/cm, the oscillation period
T = 2πpm/κ of atoms in the MOT is smaller than the
camera exposure time, restoring the MOT width. Simi-
lar results were obtained when the gradient of the mag-
netostatic trap was increased in the dark. Assuming an
equal distribution of mF states, the transverse tempera-
ture is calculated to be approximately 20 µK. These data
suggest that dissipation can be maintained well into the
regime of collisional loss [21].

FIG. 2. Position of the magneto-optic trap when Iinner and
Iouter are increased in proportion by a factor γ = Iinner/I0
with I0 = 150mA. The dotted lines show the position of the
traps predicted from the calibration using the atomic clouds
(see text).

Quantitative information about the temperature and
the density of the cloud requires investigating the width
of the MOT. Initially, atoms were collected at a gradi-
ent of 7 G/cm. Then, Iinner and Iouter were slowly in-
creased in proportion. After 20 ms, the cloud was im-
aged on a CCD camera to determine the half width at
half maximum (HWHM). Assuming that the transverse
motion of the atoms is in equilibrium with the initial
temperature, the transverse width of the magneto-optic
trap hr2i ≈ kBT /κ where κ, the spring constant of the
magneto-optic trap is linearly proportional to the gradi-
ent b. Thus, hriMOT ∼ b−1/2. An investigation of the
transverse widths of the MOT and the magnetic trap for
a wide range of gradients (Fig.3) shows excellent agree-
ment with this model. To our knowledge, this large dy-
namic range (almost 3 orders of magnitude) has not been
achieved in a waveguide before. We have also investi-

rescence image of a 2.5 mm long section of the MOT at 330

The number of atoms in the elongated atom clouds is
deduced from the ﬂuorescence images. Due to the small
transverse size of the atom clouds, a commercial parfocal
zoom lens (VZM 450) is used for magniﬁcation. The solid
angle of this lens and the eﬃciency of the CCD chip were
measured in a separate experiment. The scattering rate
of atoms in the MOT was calculated using the experi-
mental parameters for the laser intensity and detuning,
averaging over the Clebsch Gordon coeﬃcients. The vari-
ation of atom number with the gradient is shown in Fig.4.
This data can be combined with the transverse width of
the atom clouds to estimate the peak density at the var-
ious gradients. It can be seen that the density saturates
at large gradients. This feature has been observed in 3D
traps [22], and is due to multiple photon scattering. The
number of atoms decreases at the higher gradients due

In conclusion, we have demonstrated direct loading of
atoms into a ferromagnetic waveguide with large gradi-
ent and trap depth. Our measurements of the magnetic
ﬁelds, both with an audio tape head and with a cold atom
cloud, agree well with a simple model. Due to the large
relative permeability, ferromagnetic materials oﬀer the
possibility of reaching large energy splittings between vi-
brational states. This large gap may be important to pre-
serve coherence during matter wave transportation and
to facilitate cooling. By applying an external bias ﬁeld
in the system described, we have also demonstrated a bi-
furcation of the trapping potential to form a double well
[23]. This results in an experimentally observed splitting
of the elongated cloud in the transverse dimension which
is coherent in the adiabatic limit. An atom interferom-
eter in time may be formed by applying a nonadiabatic
phase shift to one of the arms [24].

Our system also permits a long guide (∼ 1 m), where
cold atoms are continuously injected at one end, and
evaporative cooling is performed along the guide. Dal-
ibard and coworkers [25] have proposed a similar sys-
tem to create a cw atom laser. Our experiments oﬀer
prospects of creating Bose condensates on a substrate on
a much shorter time scale or even continuously.

The electric ﬁeld in mm-sized clouds of cold Rb+-ions is
measured using the Stark eﬀect of Rydberg atoms embed-
ded in the ion clouds. The ion clouds are produced by UV
photoionization of laser-cooled rubidium atoms in a magneto-
optic trap. In very dense ion clouds, the Rydberg atom ex-
citation spectra reﬂect the presence of a neutral plasma core
and a positively charged ion shell.

Highly excited Rydberg atoms [1] are very sensitive to
static and AC electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and can be
used for the spectroscopic detection and compensation
of such ﬁelds. Rydberg atoms have been used to detect
microwave and FIR radiation [2], to measure and to com-
pensate weak static electric ﬁelds [3], and to study QED
level shifts and cavity-QED eﬀects involving only few mi-
crowave photons [4]. The spectroscopy of Rydberg atoms
has been employed to diagnose electric ﬁelds in DC and
high-frequency discharge plasmas [5]. In this paper, we
use Rydberg atom spectroscopy to determine the electric
ﬁeld in millimeter-sized, strongly coupled plasmas that
since recently can be generated by the laser excitation
of laser-cooled clouds of atoms [6]. These plasmas hold
the promise of bearing novel low-temperature recombi-
nation [7] and oscillation [8] behavior. Further, there is
evidence for a Mott transition, by which strongly-coupled
plasmas and/or dense gases of Rydberg atoms may form
a new state of highly excited, metastable matter [9]. To
investigate these and other issues, one could utilize the
non-invasive ﬁeld-measurement method employed in the
present paper.

Our experiment has recently been described [10]. In a
two-step optical excitation, laser-cooled rubidium atoms
conﬁned in a volume < 1mm3 are ﬁrst excited from the
ground state 5S1/2 to the 5P3/2 state, which has an
ionization wavelength of λion = 479.1nm. A UV laser
pulse (λUV = 355nm, duration<10ns, pulse energy up
to 10mJ) then partially ionizes the 5P3/2-atoms, produc-
ing photoelectrons with 0.9eV initial kinetic energy. The
photoelectrons escape on a time scale of a few ns, leav-
ing behind a cloud of slow Rb+-ions. About 23ns after
the UV pulse and while the lower-step laser is still on,
the remaining 5P3/2-atoms that are embedded in the ion
plasma are excited by a blue dye laser pulse (λ ≈ 480nm,
duration<10ns, bandwidth ≈ 10GHz). The ion cloud
does not signiﬁcantly expand before the blue pulse ar-
rives. The blue pulse excites bound Rydberg states, the

Stark eﬀect of which we use to measure the plasma elec-
tric ﬁelds.

We detect the Rydberg atoms using the mechanism
explained in the following. The ion plasma represents an
electron trap with a depth U0 given by the ion number,
the cloud size and the proﬁle of the charge distribution
[6]. In most of our experiments U0 < 0.9eV, in which case
no or only few UV-generated photoelectrons are retained
in the electron trap (the ones that are moderated to low
enough energy on their way out). However, the plasma
electron trap becomes populated with electrons of about
10meV energy due to direct photoionization of 5P3/2-
atoms by the ASE with λ < λion contained in the blue
laser pulse and due to thermal ionization of a fraction
of the bound Rydberg atoms excited by the blue pulse
[10]. Within a few µs, l-changing collisions between the
trapped electrons and the Rydberg atoms eﬃciently pro-
mote the latter into long-lived high-hli states. During the
subsequent Coulomb expansion of the plasma, which typ-
ically takes a few tens of µs, the depth U0 of the plasma
electron trap approaches zero. During that time, the
electrons trapped in the plasma are gradually released,
producing a plasma decay signal in our microchannel-
plate (MCP) electron detector, which is located about
10cm from the atomic cloud. A large fraction of the sur-
viving high-l Rydberg atoms thermally ionize on a time
scale of order 10ms [10], which exceeds the plasma decay
time by about a factor of thousand. The delayed ther-
mal electrons originating in the high-l Rydberg atoms
are counted in a gate that starts well after the plasma
decay, yielding a noise-free signal of the Rydberg atom
excitation. Rydberg excitation spectra are obtained by
recording the delayed electron counts as a function of the
wavelength of the blue laser.

Fig. 1 shows a typical experimental Rydberg excitation
spectrum of atoms in an electric-ﬁeld-bearing plasma.
The ﬁeld manifests itself through a) the appearance of
p- and hydrogenic lines, labeled p and h in Fig. 1, b)
termination of the discrete Rydberg series at a certain
ﬁeld-dependent value of the principal quantum number
n, and c) continuum lowering. While the eﬀects a) and
b) are solely determined by the state of the ion plasma at
the time instant of the Rydberg excitation, the feature c)
also depends on the history of the Rydberg atoms after
their excitation. Since we intend to analyze the plasma
at the time instant of the Rydberg atom excitation, we
disregard the feature c) as a ﬁeld measurement tool. We
also don’t use b), because we have found that in many of
our spectra the laser linewidth terminates the Rydberg

1

series, but not the electric ﬁeld.

FIG. 1. Experimental Rydberg excitation spectrum of
87Rb 5P3/2 atoms embedded in a laser-generated ion plasma.
The three types of spectral ranges with low oscillator strength,
denoted hs-, mid- and pd-gaps, become ﬁlled in at certain crit-
ical wavelengths that depend on the strength of the plasma
electric ﬁeld. The detail plots in the lower row show how we
determine the critical wavelengths.

The features of the above type a) develop as follows.
As n is increased, the electric ﬁeld ﬁrst manifests itself
in the appearance of p-lines and of triangular-shaped
h-features (see Fig. 1), caused by electric-ﬁeld-induced
state mixing. Due to the linear Stark eﬀect, the hydro-
genic states fan out over an energy range 3n2E (atomic
units) ( [1] and Fig. 2). As n increases further, the h-
features progressively expand and ﬁll in the spectral gaps
of originally zero oscillator strength between the discrete
non-hydrogenic s-, p- and d-lines. There are three types
of such spectral gaps, which we label hs-, mid- and pd-
gaps. The gaps become ﬁlled in with signiﬁcant oscillator
strength in exactly that order, at quite well deﬁned crit-
ical wavelengths. Those wavelengths can be readily con-
verted into critical eﬀective quantum numbers nhs, nmid,
and npd. The ni are robust indicators for the electric
ﬁeld, because they are solely determined by the general
spreading behavior of the quasi-continuous h-features.
No absolute line strength or line-strength ratio needs to
be determined.

Assuming a constant electric ﬁeld E0, the values of
ni at which the spectral gaps become ﬁlled in can be
related to E0 using the Stark map of Rb. As shown in
Fig. 2, the hs-gap below the hydrogenic levels with princi-
pal quantum number n disappears when the energy shift
of the most red-shifted hydrogenic state, which is approx-
imately −3n2E0/2, equals the splitting 0.13n−3 between
the unshifted hydrogenic energy and the next-lower s-
state. Further, Fig. 2 shows that the mid-gaps, i.e. the
gaps between the states (n + 3)s and (n + 1)d and be-

tween the ﬁeld-free hydrogenic states n− 1 and the states
(n + 2)p, become entirely covered with hydrogenic states
at practically identical electric ﬁelds. Finally, the pd-gaps
disappear when neighboring hydrogenic manifolds meet,
i.e. when 3n2E0 = n−3. The relations between E0 and
the critical quantum numbers ni0 are obtained as

E0 = 0.086n−5
hs0
E0 = 0.23n−5
E0 = 0.33n−5

mid0
pd0 (atomic units).

(1)

The zeros in the subscripts indicate that these relations
hold for a constant electric ﬁeld. Atomic species with
quantum defects diﬀerent from Rb would follow similar
relations with diﬀerent numerical factors. Further, the
Eqs. 1 share, as expected, the n−5 dependence of the
familiar Inglis-Teller relation [11].

FIG. 2. Stark map of Rb in the vicinity of the n = 19 and

n = 20 hydrogenic manifolds.

To model our experimental spectra, we have calculated
the photoabsorption spectra S(E0, λ) of randomly ori-
ented atoms in constant electric ﬁelds E0. Since from
the 5P intermediate state we excite three manifolds of the
magnetic quantum number |m|, one spectrum S(E0, λ) is
a properly weighted sum of an m = 0, an m = 1 and an
m = 2 spectrum. The spectra are obtained as outlined in
[12] using a spherical basis set of all states up to n = 90.
To account for the laser linewidth, the spectra are convo-
luted with Gaussians of a few GHz FWHM. The calcu-
lated spectra, one of which is shown in Fig. 3 a), display
the same qualitative features as our experimental spec-
tra. This applies, in particular, to the triangular shape
of the h-features, which is produced by the unresolved
excitation of the states in the hydrogenic manifolds.

An investigation of the calculated photoexcitation
spectra reveals that the closing of the pd-gap appears
particularly sudden due to the following peculiarity: for
parameters between the mid-gap and the pd-gap closing,
indicated by a double-arrow in Fig. 2, the blue-shifting
hydrogenic levels within the pd-gap, marked with open
circles in Fig. 2, carry much less oscillator strength than

2

l
all the other nearby hydrogenic levels. As a result, the
whole pd-gap appears virtually oscillator-strength-free up
until the pd-gap closing condition 3n2E0 ≥ n−3 is satis-
ﬁed. Once the pd-gap closing condition is satisﬁed, the
oscillator strength of the hydrogenic states inside the pd-
gap increases rather abruptly. This behavior enhances
the clarity of the pd-gap closing.

FIG. 3. Calculated isotropic excitation spectra of 87Rb 5P
atoms into Rydberg states. Panel a) is for a homogeneous
electric ﬁeld E0 = 6 × 10−9at. un.= 31V/cm. Panel b) shows
the excitation spectrum - upside down - in a Gaussian cloud
of 4 × 105 Rb+ ions that has a most probable electric ﬁeld of
Emax = 31V/cm. The arrows mark the critical wavelengths
where the spectral gaps of low oscillator strength become ﬁlled
in.

The electric ﬁeld experienced by the 5P3/2-atoms is not
homogeneous but follows a probability distribution P (E).
Assuming identical Gaussian density proﬁles for the ions
and the 5P3/2-atoms embedded in between them, the dis-
tribution P (E) can be calculated by a random placement
of ion charges and 5P3/2-atoms using a radial distribution
function P (r) = 4πr2(2πσ2)−3/2exp(−r2/(2σ2)). The
resultant ﬁeld distributions P (E) have well deﬁned most
probable electric ﬁelds Emax, which practically coincide
with the singularities of the distributions produced by the
corresponding smoothed charge distributions (compare
the solid and dotted curves in Fig. 4). The eﬀect of the
microﬁelds of the discrete ion charges largely is to smear
out the singularities produced by the smoothed charge
distributions, adding ﬁelds signiﬁcantly larger than Emax
to the ﬁeld distribution. Deviations of the density pro-
ﬁles of the ions and the 5P3/2-atoms from Gaussians will
modify P (E), a dominant peak of P (E). However, a
most probable ﬁeld Emax and a microﬁeld-induced tail of
ﬁelds E > Emax will remain.

We have used simulated electric-ﬁeld distributions
P (E) to form averages of the spectra S(E0, λ) weighted
by P (E). As shown in panel b) of Fig. 3, one can still eas-
ily obtain critical quantum numbers nhs, nmid, and npd
at which the respective regions of low oscillator strength
disappear. The excitation spectra a) and b) in Fig. 3
are, in fact, quite similar, because the P (E) are clearly
dominated by ﬁelds near the most probable one. The
microﬁeld-induced spread of P (E) from Emax towards

3

higher ﬁelds causes the spectral gaps with low oscillator
strength to become ﬁlled in at values of n that are slightly
lower than in the case of a homogeneous ﬁeld E0 = Emax.

ing a Gaussian density distribution. Dotted: Field distribu-
tion of the corresponding continuous charge density. Dashed:

Evaluating a number of spectra as shown in Fig. 3
b), we have determined the relations between the most
probable ﬁelds Emax and the critical eﬀective quantum
numbers nhs, nmid, and npd for Rydberg atoms excited
in Gaussian ion clouds with a FWHM of about 1mm:

Emax = 0.050n−5

Emax = 0.145n−5

Emax = 0.26n−5
pd (atomic units),

(2)

We have used Eqs. 2 to experimentally determine the
values of Emax in ion clouds with diameters of ∼ 1mm
and various ion numbers. The spectra obtained in a few
such experiments are displayed in Fig. 5. The critical
wavelengths, indicated by arrows, have been determined
as shown in Figs. 1 and 3, and have been converted
into critical quantum numbers nhs, nmid and npd. Using
Eq. 2, up to three spectroscopic measurements of Emax
are obtained for each spectrum. The relative uncertainty
of each single electric-ﬁeld value is 30%. Within that un-
certainty, the diﬀerent electric-ﬁeld values obtained for
the individual spectra agree well. The electric ﬁeld val-
ues quoted in Fig. 5 are the averages over all ﬁeld values
obtained for the respective spectra.

The most probable ﬁeld Emax in Gaussian ion clouds
can be calculated as Emax = (3.1 × 10−10Nionσ−2)Vm,
with the RMS cloud size σ and ion number Nion. We
have independently deduced Nion from measurements of
the MOT ﬂuorescence. The values of σ could be deter-
mined from cuts through CCD images of the atom cloud
ﬂuorescence, yielding values of σ ranging from 0.3mm to
0.5mm. For large atom clouds, we have found that the
measured ﬁelds exceed the calculated ones by up to a

l
l
factor of ten. As the atom cloud size is decreased, the
discrepancy drops to about a factor of two. The ﬁelds
deduced from the spectra are, of course, the ones to be
trusted. The most likely explanation for the discrepancy
and its dependence on the size of the atomic cloud is that
the ions were actually not excited in the whole atomic
cloud, but were concentrated in a signiﬁcantly smaller
volume determined by the diameters of the excitation
laser pulses.

FIG. 5. Experimental excitation spectra of 87Rb 5P3/2
atoms embedded in photo-excited plasmas that contain the
indicated numbers Nion of Rb+-ions. The σ-parameters of the
utilized Gaussian clouds of laser-cooled atoms are also shown.
The most probable electric ﬁelds Emax, shown on the right,
are spectroscopically determined and carry an uncertainty of
about 20%.

If the number of ions in a Gaussian cloud exceeds
7.8×105mm−1σ, the potential depth U0 of the ion plasma
exceeds 0.9eV, and a fraction of the UV-excited photo-
electrons will be retained [6]. This is clearly the case in
the lowest two spectra of Fig. 5, where we exceed the
critical ion number by factors > 2.5 and > 10, respec-
tively.
If the fraction of retained electrons is large, a
macroscopically close-to-neutral plasma core is formed,
which is surrounded by a positively charged ionic shell.
The electric ﬁeld in the core is close to zero, while the

shell carries a large electric ﬁeld. The distribution P (E)
will thus become bi-modal, featuring a peak near E = 0
and a high-ﬁeld peak. Rydberg atoms excited in the
shell produce the spectroscopic ﬁeld signatures discussed
in this paper, while atoms excited in the core contribute
a low-ﬁeld excitation spectrum with resolved Rydberg
resonances up to large n. The excitation spectra shown
in the two lowest plots of Fig. 5 appear, in fact, as su-
perpositions of a high-ﬁeld and a low-ﬁeld spectrum, as
expected for bi-modal distributions P (E).
In the low-
est curve, the high-ﬁeld component of P (E) apparently
is strongly dominated by the low-ﬁeld one, making it
hard to determine the value of the electric ﬁeld in the
shell. The presence of a strong electric ﬁeld, can, how-
ever, be guessed from the appearance of p-lines at long
wavelengths.

We note that in the case of perfect macroscopic neu-
trality of the core the microﬁelds in the core would fol-
low a Holtsmark distribution [13], as displayed in Fig. 4.
For our charge carrier densities and laser linewidths, the
Holtsmark ﬁelds are too low to be detectable.

In this work, we have used spectroscopic tools to probe
the electric ﬁelds in small, laser-excited plasmas. The
technique has a large future potential: using crossed and
focused Rydberg atom excitation beams, it will be pos-
sible to perform spatially resolved measurements of the
plasma electric ﬁelds. A variation of the time delay be-
tween the UV pulse and the blue probe pulse will allow
one to study the plasma expansion via the decay of the
electric ﬁeld. The use of a laser with a narrow band-
width (∼ 1MHz) will allow one to detect smaller ﬁelds,
such as the Holtsmark ﬁelds, and to make precise mea-
surements of the detailed electric-ﬁeld distribution P (E).
Measurements of P (E) could reveal inhomogeneities and
instabilities in the plasma, which are expected to pro-
duce structures in P (E) at excessive ﬁelds. Spatial order
in the charge carrier arrangement, such as Wigner crys-
tals [14] and the formation of crystalline Rydberg matter
[9] may become detectable via measurements of P (E).

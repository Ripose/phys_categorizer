We present a new measurement constraining Lorentz and CPT violation of the proton using a
hydrogen maser double resonance technique. A search for hydrogen Zeeman frequency variations
with a period of the sidereal day (23.93 h) sets a clean limit on violation of Lorentz and CPT
symmetry of the proton at the 10−27 GeV level.

Experimental investigations of Lorentz symmetry pro-
vide important tests of the standard model of parti-
cle physics and general relativity. While the standard
model successfully describes particle phenomenology, it
is believed to be the low energy limit of a fundamental
theory that incorporates gravity. This underlying the-
ory may be Lorentz invariant, yet contain spontaneous
symmetry-breaking that could result at the level of the
standard model in small violations of Lorentz invariance
and CPT (symmetry under simultaneous application of
Charge conjugation, Parity inversion, and Time rever-
sal).

Clock comparisons [1,2] provide sensitive tests of rota-
tion invariance and hence Lorentz symmetry by bounding
the frequency variation of a given clock as its orientation
changes, e.g., with respect to the inertial reference frame
deﬁned by the ﬁxed stars [3]. Atomic clocks are typi-
cally used, involving the electromagnetic signals emitted
or absorbed on hyperﬁne or Zeeman transitions. Here
we report results from a hydrogen (H) maser experiment
that sets an improved clean limit on Lorentz and CPT
violation of the proton at the level of 10−27 GeV as the
H maser rotates with the Earth.

Our H maser measurement is motivated by a stan-
dard model extension developed by Kosteleck´y and oth-
ers [3–7]. This standard-model extension is quite general:
it emerges as the low-energy limit of any underlying the-
ory that generates the standard model and that contains
spontaneous Lorentz symmetry violation [4]. For exam-
ple, such characteristics might emerge from string theory
[5]. A key feature of the standard-model extension is that
it is formulated at the level of the known elementary par-
ticles, and thus enables quantitative comparison of a wide
array of searches for Lorentz and CPT violation [6]. The
dimensionless suppression factor for such eﬀects would
likely be the ratio of the appropriate low-energy scale to
the Planck scale, perhaps combined with dimensionless
coupling constants [3–7].

Recent experimental work motivated by this standard-
model extension includes Penning trap tests by Gabrielse
et al. on the antiproton and H− [8], and by Dehmelt et
al. on the electron and positron [9], which place im-
proved limits on Lorentz and CPT violation in these sys-
tems. A re-analysis by Adelberger, Gundlach, Heckel,
and co-workers of existing data from the “E¨ot-Wash II”

spin-polarized torsion pendulum [10] sets the most strin-
gent bound to date on Lorentz and CPT violation of the
electron: approximately 10−29 GeV [11]. A recent search
for Zeeman-frequency sidereal variations in a 129Xe/3He
maser places an improved constraint on Lorentz and CPT
violation involving the neutron at the level of 10−31 GeV
[12]. Also the KTeV experiment at Fermilab and the
OPAL and DELPHI collaborations at CERN have lim-
ited possible Lorentz and CPT violation in the K and
Bd systems [13].

The hydrogen maser is an established tool in preci-
sion tests of fundamental physics [14]. H masers op-
erate on the ∆F = 1, ∆mF = 0 hyperﬁne transition
(the “clock” transition) in the ground electronic state of
atomic hydrogen [15]. Hydrogen molecules are dissoci-
ated into atoms in an RF discharge and the atoms are
spatially state selected via a hexapole magnet (Fig. 1).
Atoms in the F = 1, mF = +1, 0 states are focused into
a Teﬂon coated cell, thereby creating the population in-
version necessary for active maser oscillation. The cell
resides in a microwave cavity resonant with the ∆F = 1
transition at 1420 MHz. A static magnetic ﬁeld of ∼ 1
milligauss is applied by a solenoid surrounding the res-
onant cavity to maintain the quantization axis of the H
atoms. For normal H maser operation, this magnetic ﬁeld
is directed vertically upwards in the laboratory reference
frame. The F = 1, mF = 0 atoms are stimulated to make
a transition to the F = 0 state by the thermal microwave
ﬁeld in the cavity. The energy from the atoms then acts
as a source to increase the microwave ﬁeld. With suﬃ-
ciently high polarization ﬂux and low cavity losses, this
feedback induces active maser oscillation. H masers built
in our laboratory over the last 30 years provide fractional
frequency stability on the clock transition of better than
10−14 over averaging intervals of minutes to days and
can operate undisturbed for several years before requir-
ing routine maintenance.

The ∆mF = 0 clock transition has no leading-order
sensitivity to Lorentz and CPT violation [3,7] because
the transition encompasses no change in longitudinal spin
orientation. In contrast, the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman
transitions are maximally sensitive to potential Lorentz
and CPT violation [7]. Therefore, we searched for a
Lorentz-violation signature by monitoring the Zeeman
frequency (νZ ≈ 850 Hz in a static magnetic ﬁeld of

1

0.6 mG) as the laboratory reference frame rotated side-
really. We utilized an H maser double resonance tech-
nique [16] to measure νZ. We applied a weak, oscillating
magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the static ﬁeld at a fre-
quency close to the Zeeman transition, thereby coupling
the three sublevels of the hydrogen F = 1 manifold [17].
Provided that a population diﬀerence exists between the
mF = ±1 states, this coupling alters the energy of the
mF = 0 state, thus shifting the measured maser clock
frequency in a manner described by a line shape that
is antisymmetric about the Zeeman frequency for suﬃ-
ciently small static ﬁelds (Fig. 2) [16]. We determined
νZ by measuring the resonant driving ﬁeld frequency at
which the maser clock frequency is equal to its unper-
turbed value. Due to the excellent frequency stability of
the H maser, this double resonance technique allowed the
determination of νZ with a precision of ∼ 1 mHz [18].

FIG. 1. Schematic of the H maser in its ambient magnetic
ﬁeld stabilization loop. Large Helmholtz coils surround the
maser and cancel external ﬁeld ﬂuctuations as detected by a
ﬂuxgate magnetometer placed close to the maser region. Zee-
man coils mix the mF sublevels of the F = 1 hyperﬁne state,
and allow sensitive measurement of the Zeeman frequency
through pulling of the maser frequency [16], as determined
by comparison to a reference H maser.

In the small-ﬁeld limit, the hydrogen Zeeman fre-
quency is proportional to the static magnetic ﬁeld. Four
layers of high permeability magnetic shields surround the
maser (Fig. 1), screening external ﬁeld ﬂuctuations by
a factor of 32,000. Nevertheless, the residual eﬀects of
day-night variations in ambient magnetic noise shifted
the measured Zeeman frequency with a 24 hour periodic-
ity which was diﬃcult to distinguish from a true sidereal
(23.93 h period) signal in our data sample. Therefore, we
employed an active stabilization system to cancel exter-
nal magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations (Fig. 1). A ﬂuxgate mag-
netometer sensed the ﬁeld near the maser cavity with a
shielding factor of only 6 to external magnetic ﬁelds due
to its location at the edge of the shields. A feedback
loop controlled the current in large Helmholtz coils (2.4

m dia.) surrounding the maser to maintain a constant
ﬁeld. This feedback loop eﬀectively reduced the sidereal
ﬂuctuations of νZ caused by external ﬁelds at the location
of the magnetometer to below 1 µHz.

FIG. 2. An example of a double resonance measurement
of the F = 1, ∆mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency (νZ) in the
H maser. The change from the unperturbed maser clock fre-
quency is plotted versus the driving ﬁeld frequency. (The sta-
tistical uncertainty in each point is approximately 50 µHz.)
The solid line is the ﬁt of the antisymmetric lineshape de-
scribed in [16] to the data, yielding νZ = 857.125 ± 0.003 Hz
in this example.

We accumulated data in three separate runs of 11, 9
and 12 days over the period Nov., 1999 to Mar., 2000.
During data taking, the maser remained in a closed, tem-
perature controlled room to reduce potential systematics
from thermal drifts that might have 24 hour periodicities.
Each νZ measurement required approximately 20 min-
utes of data (Fig. 2). We also monitored the H maser am-
plitude, residual magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations, maser and
room temperatures, and the current through the maser
solenoid (which set the static magnetic ﬁeld). During
the second and third runs, we reversed the direction of
the static magnetic ﬁeld created by the maser’s internal
solenoid in order to investigate possible systematic de-
pendence of the diurnal variation of νZ on ﬁeld direction.
(No such dependence was observed.) In the ﬁeld-reversed
conﬁguration, the axial magnetic ﬁeld in the storage bulb
was anti-parallel to the ﬁeld near the exit from the state-
selecting hexapole magnet. Thus H atoms traversed a
region of magnetic ﬁeld inversion on their way into the
storage bulb, causing loss of atoms from the maser ex-
cited state (F = 1, mF = 0) due to Majorana transitions
as well as sudden transitions of atoms from the F = 1,
mF = +1 state to the F = 1, mF = −1 state. In the
ﬁeld reversed conﬁguration, the maser amplitude was re-
duced by 30% and both the maser clock frequency and
Zeeman frequency were less stable. Thus, our constraint
on sidereal-period νZ variations was 5 times weaker in
the ﬁeld-reversed conﬁguration than in the parallel-ﬁeld
conﬁguration.

FIG. 3.

Zeeman frequency data from 11 days of the

Lorentz/CPT test (run 1) using the H maser.

To identify any sidereal variations in νZ , we ﬁt a
sidereal-period sinusoid and a slowly varying background
to the accumulated νZ measurements. (See Fig. 3 for the
11 days of data from run 1.) Two coeﬃcients, δνZ,α and
δνZ,β, parameterize the sine and cosine components of
the sidereal oscillations.
(α and β also correspond to
non-rotating directions in the plane perpendicular to the
Earth’s axis of rotation.) In addition, we used piecewise
continuous linear terms (whose slopes were allowed to
vary independently for each day) to model the slow drift
of the Zeeman frequency. In the ﬁeld-inverted conﬁgu-
ration, large variations in νZ led to days for which this
model did not successfully ﬁt the data. Large values of
the reduced χ2 and systematic deviation of the residu-
als from a normal distribution characterized such days,
which we cut from the data sample. For each run, the ﬁt
determined the components δνZ,α and δνZ,β of the side-
real sinusoidal variation (see Table I). The total weighted
means and uncertainties for δνZ,α and δνZ,β were then
formed from all three data sets, yielding the measured
value A ≡ p(δνZ,α)2 + (δνZ,β )2 = 0.49 ± 0.34 mHz (1-σ
level). This result is consistent with no observed side-
real variation in the hydrogen F = 1, mF = ±1 Zeeman
frequency, given reasonable assumptions about the prob-
ability distribution for A [19].

Systematic sidereal-period ﬂuctuations of νZ were
smaller than the 0.34 mHz statistical resolution. The cur-
rent in the main solenoid typically varied by less than 5
nA out of 100 µA over 10 days, corresponding to a change
in νZ of ∼ 50 mHz. We corrected the measured Zee-
man frequency for this solenoid current drift. The side-
real component of the current correction was typically
25 ± 10 pA, corresponding to a sidereal-period variation
of νZ ≈ 0.16 ± 0.08 mHz. The temperature inside the
maser cabinet enclosure had a sidereal component below
0.5 mK, corresponding to a sidereal-period modulation
of νZ of less than 0.1 mHz. Potential Lorentz-violating
eﬀects acting directly on the electron spins in the ﬂux-
gate magnetometer’s ferromagnetic core could change the
ﬁeld measured by the magnetometer and mask a poten-
tial signal from the H maser experiment. However, any
such eﬀect would be greatly suppressed by a factor of

Table I. Means and standard errors for δνZ,α and δνZ,β, the
quadrature amplitudes of sidereal-period variations in the hy-
drogen F = 1, mF = ±1 Zeeman frequency. Results are
displayed for each of three data-taking runs, listing also the
number of days of useful data, the number of discarded data-
taking days (in parentheses), and the direction of the maser’s
internal magnetic ﬁeld in the laboratory frame.

E/kT ∼ 10−16 below the <
∼ 1 nG sensitivity of the mag-
netometer, where E is the Lorentz-violating shift of the
electron spin energy (known to be <
∼ 10−29 GeV [10]) and
T is the temperature of the spins when the core is in zero
magnetic ﬁeld (the equilibrium condition of the magne-
tometer lock loop). Also, the magnetic shielding reduces
ﬁeld ﬂuctuations at the magnetometer by a factor of only
6 whereas ﬂuctuations at the storage-bulb are reduced by
32,000. Therefore, any eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld shifts in-
duced in the magnetometer by Lorentz/CPT-violations
were negligible in the present experiment. Spin-exchange
collisions between the H atoms shift the zero crossing of
the double resonance from the true Zeeman frequency
[20]. Hence, the measured νZ varies with H density in
the maser. We monitored the atomic density by mea-
suring the output maser power, with the relation to νZ
being <
∼ 0.8 mHz/fW. During long term operation, the
average maser power drifted less than 1 fW per day. The
sidereal component was typically less than 0.05 fW, cor-
responding to a 0.04 mHz variation in the Zeeman fre-
quency. Combining these systematic errors in quadrature
with the statistical uncertainty produces a ﬁnal limit on
a sidereal variation in the hydrogen F = 1, ∆mF = ±1
Zeeman frequency of 0.37 mHz, which expressed in en-
ergy units is 1.5 × 10−27 GeV.

The hydrogen atom is directly sensitive to Lorentz and
CPT violations of the proton and the electron. Follow-
ing the notation of Refs. [3,7], one ﬁnds that a limit on
a sidereal-period modulation of the Zeeman frequency
(δνZ ) provides a bound on the following parameters
in the standard model extension of Kosteleck´y and co-
workers:

Eq. (1) indicates the direction along the quantization axis
of the apparatus, which is vertical in the lab frame. The
superscripts e and p refer to the electron and proton,
respectively.

As in Refs. [3,9], we can re-express the time varying

parameters expressed in a non-rotating inertial frame as

where J refers to either of two orthogonal directions per-
pendicular to the earth’s rotation axis and χ = 48◦ is the

As noted above, a re-analysis of existing data from a
spin-polarized torsion pendulum [10] sets the most strin-
gent bound to date on Lorentz and CPT violation of the
electron: ˜be
<
∼ 10−29 GeV [11]. Therefore, the H maser
measurement reported here constrains Lorentz and CPT
violations of the proton: ˜bp
J ≤ 2 × 10−27 GeV at the
one sigma level. This limit is comparable to that derived
[3] from the 199Hg/133Cs clock comparison experiment
of Hunter, Lamoreaux et al. [2] but in a much cleaner
system: the hydrogen atom nucleus is simply a proton,
whereas signiﬁcant nuclear model uncertainties aﬀect the
interpretation of experiments on many-nucleon systems
such as 199Hg and 133Cs.

To our knowledge, no search for sidereal variations in
the hydrogen Zeeman frequency has been performed pre-
viously. Nevertheless, implicit limits can be set from a
widely-practiced H maser characterization procedure in
which the Zeeman frequency is measured by observing
the drop in maser output power induced by a drive ﬁeld
swept through the Zeeman resonance [15,21]. It is reason-
able to assume that sidereal-period variations of the Zee-
man frequency of ∼ 1 Hz would have been noticed. Thus,
our result improves upon existing implicit constraints by
over two orders of magnitude.

In conclusion, precision comparisons of atomic clocks
provide sensitive tests of Lorentz and CPT symmetries
[3–7]. A new measurement with an atomic hydrogen
maser provides a clean limit on Lorentz and CPT viola-
tion involving the proton that is consistent with no eﬀect
at the 10−27 GeV level. Further details of this work will
be found in Ref. [22].

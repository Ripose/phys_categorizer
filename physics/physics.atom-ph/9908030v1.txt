The positron-hydrogen atom scattering system is consid-
ered within the S-wave model. Convergence in the elastic
scattering, excitation, ionization, and positronium formation
channels is studied as a function of the number and type of
states used to expand the total wave function.
It is found
that all unphysical resonances disappear only if near-complete
pseudostate expansions are applied to both the atomic and
positronium centers.

In recent years there has been substantial progress in
the ﬁeld of electron-atom collisions. Close-coupling based
methods, utilizing near-complete pseudostate expansions
about the atomic center, have been shown to yield very
accurate results for discrete excitation and ionization
channels, see for example [1–4]. This progress is primarily
based on the study of the electron-hydrogen atom scatter-
ing S-wave model (only states with zero orbital angular
momentum are retained) performed by Bray and Stel-
bovics [5]. They showed, by simply taking a pseudostate
expansion whose completeness improves with increasing
number of states N , that cross sections for discrete and
ionization channels converged at all energies. Pseudores-
onances, typically associated with small N calculations,
disappeared for suﬃciently large N , and convergence was
to the correct independently evaluated results. This was
an extraordinarily powerful result that is at the base of
the substantial success recently enjoyed by the various
implementations of the close-coupling theories.

The situation for positron-atom scattering is somewhat

tered states the positronium formation channel needs to
be included in the calculations in order to allow for all
possible scattering channels. In other words, one needs
a combined basis consisting of two independent basis
sets. However, in this case if each of the components
of the basis is large enough, one may expect instabili-
ties in the calculations. The reason for this is that at
small distances between colliding fragments functions of
diﬀerent basis components may essentially repeat each
other due to their nonorthogonality. Thus, the close–
coupling problem with the combined–basis–expansions

is ill–conditioned.
Is this an insurmountable obstacle?
This question has remained unanswered for a long time.
Mitroy, Berge, and Stelbovics [6] and Mitroy and Rat-
navelu [7] have performed convergence studies for the
full positron-hydrogen problem at low energies. Below
the ﬁrst hydrogen excitation threshold they showed good
agreement between large pseudostate close coupling cal-
culations and the highly accurate variational calculations
of Humberston [8]. However, at higher energies, particu-
larly above the ionization threshold the situation is less
clear.

We adopt the often-used CC(N, N ′) notation for close-
coupling calculations that utilise N atomic eigenstates
and N ′ positronium eigenstates to expand the total scat-
tering wave function. In addition, a bar, when applied to
N or N ′ indicates that pseudostates rather than eigen-
states are used.

In 1991 Higgins and Burke [9] showed that in the close-
coupling calculation CC(1,1) a giant resonance appeared
around 40 eV incident energy. Since that time a huge
body of literature has been devoted to the study of this
and other resonances above the ionization threshold, see
the excellent review of Walters et al. [10]. The posi-
tions and widths of the resonances have been studied
extensively [11–17], even though, as noted by Walters et
al. [10], the mid-seventies work of Simon [18,19] shows
that there may not be any positron-hydrogen scattering
resonances above the ionization threshold.

As far as we are aware the ﬁrst convincing numer-
ical evidence that shows disappearance of the above-
threshold Higgins-Burke type resonances was given by
Kernoghan, McAlinden, and Walters [20,21]. They con-
sidered the full positron-hydrogen scattering problem us-
ing pseudostate expansions on both centers. Their 18-
state CC(9, 9) calculation included s, p, and d states for
both centers. Thus it was not clear what was the pri-
mary reason, if any, for the disappearance of the Higgins-
Burke type resonances. Moreover, at energies above the
ionization threshold the authors encountered a new false
pseudoresonance structure associated with the unphys-
ical pseudostates. Smooth results for the total and the
dominant partial 1s cross sections were obtained after ap-
plying an energy averaging procedure in order to remove
the pseudoresonances. The unsmoothed partial 2s and 2p
cross sections both for atom excitation and positronium
formation contained signiﬁcantly more pseudostructure
[22].

At the same time the convergent close-coupling the-

ory (CCC) [23], which made use of CC(N , 0) calcula-
tions, i.e. neglected positronium formation, gave very
good results for the total, elastic, excitation and ion-
ization cross sections in energy regimes where positro-
nium formation cross section is either zero or small. The
CCC calculations showed no pseudoresonances. Based
on these results Kernoghan et al [22] (see also [24]) sug-
gested using pseudostates only for hydrogen with a few
eigenstates of positronium i.e., CC(N , N ′) type calcula-
tions. Results of a CC(30, 3) calculation with a 30–state
hydrogenic pseudobasis of Bray and Stelbovics [23], sup-
plemented by the three lowest positronium eigenstates
showed a considerable improvement over the CC(9, 9)
results [21]. Though the new basis did not completely
remove false pseudostructure from the 2s and 2p positro-
nium formation cross sections in the upper neighbour-
hood of the ionization threshold, the conclusion was that
in two–centre scattering problems CC(N , N ′) type calcu-
lations are adequate. Since the works of Kernoghan et al
[22] and Mitroy [24] pseudostate calculations of positron
scattering oﬀ atoms have been performed mostly using
bases of this type. The same conclusion became dom-
inant in ion-atom collisions as well mainly due to the
extensive investigations by Kuang and Lin [25–27].

The purpose of the present Letter is to demonstrate
a case where stable and convergent two–centre pseu-
dosate calculations free of any pseudoresonances could
be achieved only if near-complete pseudostate expansions
are applied to both the atomic and positronium cen-
ters, i.e. where calculations of type CC(N , N ′) are used.
This is done for the simple S-wave model that retains
only states of zero orbital angular momentum. The im-
portance of the electron-atom scattering S-wave model,
which continues to attract considerable attention [28–30],
suggests that this model might also be useful in the
positron-hydrogen case. However, for this case it has at-
tracted little attention, with the CC(2,2) calculation by
Mitroy [14] being the biggest. Yet, this problem captures
most of the diﬃculties associated with the full positron-
atom problem just as the electron-atom S-wave model
contains most of the diﬃculties associated with the full
electron-atom scattering problems. At the same time it
does not include the unnecessary, in the present context,
generalities. Particularly, there is no a priori mechanism
for any resonances including the Feshbach ones below the
ionization threshold, due to the absence of states with
non-zero angular momentum. This is why the model is
ideal for convergence studies, as only smooth cross sec-
tions are expected.

The convergent close-coupling method [1] is extended
by including the positronium formation channels. This
extension is mainly based on the work of Mitroy [14,31].
However, positronium formation matrix elements have
been written as a coupling of 12 j-symbols resulting in
only two–dimensional integrals and ﬁnite angular mo-
In addition, momentum–space pseu-
mentum sums.

dostates and corresponding formfactors are used in a
compact analytical form. To evaluate the integral over
the momentum of the virtual electron involving the loga-
rithmic singularity special–purpose orthonormal polyno-
mials have been calculated which yield an optimal Gaus-
sian quadrature. Together, these features allow big pseu-
dostate calculations to be performed eﬃciently. The gen-
eralized CCC computer code has been tested against the
CC(3,3) calculations of Mitroy and Stelbovics [16] and
other momentum space close–coupling calculations.

To evaluate the positron-hydrogen S-wave model the
total scattering wave function is expanded in terms of
bases consisting of two independent truncated Laguerre
bases with corresponding exponential fall-oﬀ factors λ
and λ′, leading to close-coupling calculations denoted by
CC(N , N ′). The N hydrogen (H) states were obtained by
diagonalising the Hamiltonian with λ ≈ 1.0. The minor
variation in λ was made to ensure that the total energy E
was exactly half-way between two adjacent pseudothresh-
olds, as the underlying integration rule requires [32,33].
The positronium (Ps) states were obtained by diagonal-
ising the corresponding Hamiltonian with λ′ = 0.5. This
choice for λ and λ′ results in approximately equal num-
ber of negative- and positive-energy states. No variation
of λ′ was performed due to the fact that at the larger
energies (above 40 eV) considered here too large a vari-
ation would be necessary to ensure that E is half-way
between two adjacent Ps pseudothresholds. Instead, the
CC(N , N ′) calculations are performed for all possible E
that are half-way between two of the Ps pseudothresh-
olds. Though in this case observables are calculated at
predeﬁned incident energies, to show convergence in the
expected to be smooth cross sections, we combine the re-
sults for varying N and N ′. If convergence is obtained
at the calculated energies such combined results should
form smooth curves.

To assure the convergence on both basis components
we took N = N ′. In general, the combined basis does not
need to be symmetric in the number of the hydrogen and
positronium pseudostates. The basic momentum space
integral equations for the transition matrix elements have
been solved using a 96-point Gauss quadrature at each
incident energy. The accuracy of the solution of the inte-
gral equations has been carefully checked for the case of
the largest basis. Any further increase in the number of
quadrature points did not signiﬁcantly change the results.
The number of states N = N ′ has been systematically
increased from 1 to 17.

In Fig. 1 the total cross section for the model is pre-
sented evaluated using a number of diﬀerent bases. The
CC(N , N ′) calculations were performed on a ﬁne en-
ergy mesh allowing for representation as a continuous
curve. The dotted curve labeled CCC is obtained from
all of the CC(N , N ′) calculations (one for each dot) with
N = N ′ = 11, . . . , 17, see above. For example, the re-
sults at around 114 and 39 eV are from the CC(17, 17)

FIG. 1. Total cross section for the positron–hydrogen scat-
tering S–wave model. The CCC-labeled curve is obtained
from CC(N , N ′) calculations with N = N ′ = 11, . . . , 17,
see text. The CC(N , N ′) calculations utilise N atomic pseu-
dostates and N ′
positronium eigenstates.

Starting with the CC(11, 0) calculation we see a
smooth cross section that is very large at small energies.
Adding three Ps eigenstates (N ′ = 3) results in a massive
drop in the cross section at low energies (in fact N ′ = 1 is
suﬃcient for this drop), but leads to Higgins-Burke type
resonances at around 15 and 50 eV. Adding a further two
Ps eigenstates (N ′ = 5) and increasing the atomic pseu-
dostate expansion to N = 17 results in only a slight shift
of the resonance to higher energies. The shift is due to the
increasing number of Ps eigenstates as we found invari-
ance in the CC(N , 3) cross sections for N = 11, . . . , 17.
However, the CCC curve is smooth devoid of any reso-
nance structure. Thus, within this model the only prac-
tical way to yield pseudoresonance-free cross sections is
to utilize near-complete pseudostate expansions for both
the atomic and Ps centers. We note that the elimina-
tion of the Higgins–Burke type resonances is achieved for
relatively small N = N ′ = 5, whereas pseudoresonance
structure disappears from N = N ′ = 11.

Fig. 2 shows some of the individual components of the
CCC total cross section given in Fig. 1. The most domi-
nant is the elastic scattering cross section followed by the
ionization and Ps formation cross sections. The Ps for-
mation cross section is evaluated by summing the cross
sections for the negative-energy Ps states projected onto
the Ps true discrete spectrum. The ionization (breakup)
cross section is evaluated by subtracting from the total
cross section the Ps formation cross section and the sum
of the atomic negative-energy state cross sections pro-
jected onto the true discrete atomic spectrum. Though
the Ps formation cross section is generally very small the

FIG. 3. Discrete H excitation and Ps formation cross sec-

description of the CCC calculations.

The excitation cross sections to n ≤ 3 are given in
Fig. 3. Above the Ps(1s) threshold of 6.8 eV the Ps(1s)
cross section is dominant until around 20 eV where H(2s)
becomes the largest inelastic cross section. Most impor-
tantly we see smooth results for all these cross sections
even though their magnitude is quite small. This gives
us conﬁdence in the accuracy of the pesented results gen-
erally.

In summary, the CCC method for electron-atom scat-
tering [1] has been extended to positron scattering with
the inclusion of the Ps formation channel. This channel
is particularly important for the S-wave model studied
at the low and intermediate energies. Within this model
the disappearance of the Higgins–Burke type resonances

is only possible using pseudostate expansions on both
the atomic and Ps centers. Other pseudoresonances, re-
sulting from ﬁnite pseudostate expansions, disappear if
suﬃciently large expansions are taken. Utility of using si-
multaneously two near-complete expansions to yield con-
vergent results at all energies of interest has been demon-
strated. Taking as many as 17 of both atomic- and Ps-
centered states represents some of the biggest calcula-
tions of this type ever performed, and suggests the utility
of the present numerical implementation for full positron-
atom scattering problems. The presented cross sections
represent benchmark results that may be used for com-
parison with other theories. We suspect that CC(N , N ′)
type calculations will yield faster convergence and greater
accuracy for the full positron-atom scattering system over
the commonly-used CC(N , N ′) type calculations, partic-
ularly for the Ps formation cross sections.

We consider the ﬁnal stage of multiple ionization of atoms in a strong linearly polarized laser
ﬁeld within a classical model. We propose that non-sequential multiple ionization is dominated by
symmetric escape from a highly excited intermediate complex. For a conﬁguration of N electrons
with CN v symmetry in a plane perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld we analyze the classical motion
in phase space and discuss the ﬁnal momentum distribution parallel and perpendicular to the po-
larization axis. The results are in good agreement with recent experiment of multiple ionization in
Ne.

Double (or multiple) ionization of atoms is a funda-
mental process to our understanding of many electron
dynamics in external ﬁelds. The surprisingly large yields
of multiply charged ions reported in the ﬁrst experiments
with intense laser ﬁelds [1] clearly show that sequen-
tial ionization is not the leading process and that the
electron-electron correlated dynamics has to be taken
into account. One possibility is that the electron is
shaken-oﬀ due to a non-adiabatic change in potential
during the ionization of the ﬁrst electron [2], a process
that accounts for double ionization at high photon en-
ergies (above 1 keV) [3]. For multiphoton ionization a
two step process is more likely: one electron is ionized
ﬁrst, accelerated by the ﬁeld and driven back to the atom
where it ionizes the second electron in a rescattering col-
lision [4–10]. The applicability of tunneling expressions
as in [4,11] then is due to the ﬁrst ionization taking place
through a tunneling process in a quasi-static electric ﬁeld.
Such a sequence of events is supported also by the nu-
merical calculations of Becker and Faisal [10].

The correlation between the electrons was convincingly
demonstrated in a series of recent experiments. Measure-
ments of the distributions of ion and electron momenta in
double and triple ionization [12–15] clearly show a pref-
erence for electrons escaping towards the same side of the
atomic core along the ﬁeld polarization axis [14]. On ﬁrst
sight this seems to be very diﬀerent from the symmetric
escape of electrons in double ionization in the absence of a
ﬁeld, where according to Wanniers analysis the electrons
escape in opposite directions [16,17]. A closer analysis
of Wanniers arguments shows, however, that they can be
applied to this situation as well [18]. It is our aim here
to generalize this model to the correlated escape of three
or more electrons.

The essential elements of Wanniers analysis are a di-
vision of the process into two steps, the formation of a
highly excited complex of two electrons close to the core
and the two electron escape from this complex. At the
threshold for ionization, energy is scarce. Therefore, in
the dominant channel, mutual repulsion should be mini-

mal and the energy should be equally shared by the out-
going electrons. Any deviation from the symmetric ar-
rangement in phase space or in energy would be ampliﬁed
and lead to single rather than multiple ionization. These
requirements become less stringent the higher the energy
above threshold.

One can argue that a similar division of the ioniza-
tion process is possible in electric ﬁelds [18]. In partic-
ular, ionization also proceeds through the formation of
an intermediate highly excited complex, created during
the rescattering event. But the next step is diﬀerent,
the conﬁguration that dominates the ionization channel
is no longer the Wannier state and the threshold energy
is modiﬁed as well. For instance, double ionization is
observed even though the estimated energy transferred
by returning electron is too small for immediate double
ionization [12]. As discussed in [18] this is possible if
during the collision the external ﬁeld is not zero, for then
a Stark saddle opens through which the electrons can
escape. This saddle breaks the symmetry and focuses
the electrons in the direction of the electric ﬁeld. It also
forces the electrons to be close to a symmetry subspace,
since by mutual repulsion the electron that reaches the
saddle ﬁrst can push the other back to the nucleus. This
would then result in either single ionization or in another
rescattering event, but not in double ionization. Classi-
cal trajectory calculations within this symmetry subspace
are able to reproduce the main features of the experimen-
tally observed ion momentum distributions.

In the present letter we present a generalization of our
model [18] to multielectron ionization. The key assump-
tion is that the process is dominated by a symmetric
conﬁguration of the electrons with respect to the ﬁeld po-
larization axis as suggested by the experiments [12–15].
Speciﬁcally, we assume that all electrons move in a plane
perpendicular to the ﬁeld and that they obey a CN v sym-
metry, which generalizes the C2v symmetry of the previ-
ously analyzed case. The reﬂection symmetry limits the
momenta to be parallel to the symmetry planes and thus
conﬁnes the motion to a dynamically allowed subspace in

1

the high-dimensional N -body phase space. I.e. if in the
full phase space of the N -body problem initial conditions
are prepared in this subspace they will never leave it.

We take the electric ﬁeld directed along the z-axis,
and the positions of the N -electrons as zi = z, ρi = ρ
and ϕi = 2πi/N , where (ρi, ϕi, zi) are cylindrical coor-
dinates. The momenta of the electrons are all identical,
pρ,i = pρ, pz,i = pz and pϕ,i = 0. For this geometry
the classical Hamiltonian for N electrons, for zero total
angular momentum along the ﬁeld axis, in atomic units,
with inﬁnitely heavy nucleus and in dipole approxima-
tion, reads

H(pρ, pz, ρ, z, t) = N

and the pulse shape

f (t) = sin2(πt/Td).

F , ω and φ stand for peak amplitude, frequency and
phase of the external ﬁeld respectively, while Td is the
pulse duration.

Experiments show that the multiple ionization is possi-
ble even when the energy transferred by the rescattered
electron is less than that needed to lift the system to
the many electron continuum. We therefore assume that
the complex from which multiple ionization starts is de-
scribed by Hamiltonian (1) with initially negative energy
E. Moreover, since the electronic motion close to the nu-
cleus is much faster than the changes in the electric ﬁeld
the process of electron escape can be discussed adiabat-
ically for ﬁxed external ﬁeld. This allows us to analyze
the potential energy for a ﬁxed time.

Before we proceed with the analysis we take advantage
of the scaling symmetry of the classical Hamiltonian (1)
and eliminate one parameter. If the variables are rescaled
according to

√F H,

H →
ρ, z → ρ/√F , z/√F ,
pρ, pz → F 1/4pρ, F 1/4pz,
ω, t → F 3/4ω, F −3/4t

(4)

the dynamics becomes independent of the peak value of
the ﬁeld amplitude, i.e. we obtain the system described
by the Hamiltonian (1) with F = 1.

Equipotential curves of Eq. (2) in the scaled variables
(4), for N = 3 and N = 6 are shown in Fig. 1. The
saddles are located along the lines z = rs cos θs and
ρ = rs sin θs with θs = θ or θs = π − θ where

During a ﬁeld cycle the saddle moves in from inﬁnity
along the line θs = θ, back out to inﬁnity and then in
and out again along the line θs = π − θ. The angle θ
increases with the number of electrons N , while the en-
ergy of the saddle changes non-monotonically as shown in
Fig. 2. For N ≥ 14 the saddle disappears. For this many
electrons the repulsion between the electrons is stronger
than the attraction to the nucleus, see Eq. (2) for z = 0.
The situation with N ≥ 14 is rather an extreme case
from the experimental point of view but it reﬂects the
fact that a bound state for a neutral atom with N elec-
trons symmetrically distributed in a plane can not be
formed if N ≥ 14.
The saddle which is opened by the external ﬁeld al-
lows electrons to escape even if the total energy E of the
highly excited complex is negative. It is enough, classi-
cally, that E is greater than the energy of the saddle. The
saddle thus provides a kind of transition state [19,20] for
the ionization process: once the electrons cross it, they
are accelerated by the ﬁeld and pulled further away, mak-
ing a return rather unlikely. Moreover, they can acquire
the missing energy so that the electrons can escape even
when the ﬁeld vanishes. The ﬁeld thus plays a double role
in determining a threshold for this process: during the
ﬁrst stages of the rescattering process it provides the en-
ergy for the collision complex and during the ﬁnal stages
it opens the path for multiple escape.

In the experiment [15] of triple (also single and dou-
ble) ionization of Ne by ultrashort (30 fs) laser pulses at
795 nm and at intensities 1.5 PW/cm2 the distributions
of momenta of ions parallel and perpendicular to the po-
larization axis have been measured. In the limit of negli-
gibly small momentum transfer by the absorbed photons,
the ion momentum ~pion reﬂects the sum of the momenta

of the emitted electrons, ~pion = −Pi ~pi [12,15]. To cal-

culate the experimental distributions corresponding to
the triple ionization of Ne we have performed classical
trajectory simulations for N = 3. Note that the correct
equations of motion for a single electron follow from the
Hamiltonian (1) after division by N .

The Hamiltonian (1) with N = 3 is the full Hamilto-
nian for a Li with its three electrons. In order to relate it
to triple ionization from atoms with more electrons the
zero point in energy has to be shifted to the threshold for

the three electron continuum, and all energies have to be
taken relative to this level. Moreover, interactions with
the electrons in the core are neglected. Speciﬁcally, for
the modeling of the experiments [15] on triple ionization
in Ne we thus assume that in a rescattering process the
energy transfer is less than the threshold for triple ion-
ization (about 4.6 a.u.). The precise value of the initial
energy E depends on the details of the rescattering pro-
cess and can thus not be determined within our model: it
is a free parameter. The rescattering event is most likely
to take place when the ﬁeld amplitude is high, so we have
started the simulation close to the top of the pulse, i.e.
for t0 = 0.33Td, where Td = 2412 a.u. corresponds to
the experimental pulse duration [15]. The corresponding
amplitude and frequency of the ﬁeld are F = 0.207 a.u.
and ω = 0.057 a.u. For such ﬁeld parameters the sad-
dle energy equals −3.5 a.u. We have performed numer-
ical simulations for several initial energies. The distri-
butions of the electron momenta for E = −1 a.u. are
shown in Fig. 3. The distribution for parallel momenta
can be compared with the corresponding experimental
distribution of ions momenta [15]. The main features
of the distribution, its width and characteristic double
hump structure, are well reproduced in our calculation.
The minimum in the distribution is, however, less pro-
nounced than that observed in the experiment. Overall,
we take this good agreement as strong indication that
triple ionization can only occur in the neighborhood of
the symmetric process discussed here.

For initial energies below about −3 a.u.

the double
hump structure disappears and only a single maximum
remains. This corresponds to experiments with weaker
ﬁelds which transfers less energy to the rescattered elec-
tron. Then the electrons crossing the saddle have smaller
kinetic energy and the interaction with the remainder of
the pulse blurs the distribution. Such a change in the
character of the distribution with decrease of ﬁeld inten-
sity has also been observed in the experiment of double
ionization of He atoms [12].

The distribution for perpendicular ion momenta can
not be calculated in our model since this component van-
ishes exactly by symmetry. But we can calculate the
transverse momentum of an individual escaping electron,
as shown in Fig. 3. The absence of events around zero re-
ﬂects simply the eﬀect of the repulsion between electrons.
Measurements of this quantity should provide further test
of this model.

In conclusion we have shown that the double humped
structure in ion momenta distribution observed in the
experiment of triple ionization of Ne [15] can be calcu-
lated within a classical simulation assuming symmetri-
cally escaping electrons. This multi-ionization path can
be extended to include up to 13 electrons. The successful
comparison with the experimental data supports the idea
that the dominant contribution to ionization comes from
initial conditions in the highly excited collision complex
that are asymptotic to this symmetry plane, very much
as in Wanniers analysis [16,17,21].

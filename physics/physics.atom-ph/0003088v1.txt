(November 24, 2013)

Electron-ion recombination of completely stripped Bi83+
was investigated at the Experimental Storage Ring (ESR) of
the GSI in Darmstadt.
It was the ﬁrst experiment of this
kind with a bare ion heavier than argon. Absolute recombi-
nation rate coeﬃcients have been measured for relative ener-
gies between ions and electrons from 0 up to about 125 eV. In
the energy range from 15 meV to 125 eV a very good agree-
ment is found between the experimental result and theory
for radiative recombination (RR). However, below 15 meV
the experimental rate increasingly exceeds the RR calcula-
tion and at Erel= 0 eV it is a factor of 5.2 above the ex-
pected value. For further investigation of this enhancement
phenomenon the electron density in the interaction region was
set to 1.6×106 cm−3, 3.2×106 cm−3 and 4.7×106 cm−3. This
variation had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the recombination
rate. An additional variation of the magnetic guiding ﬁeld of
the electrons from 70 mT to 150 mT in steps of 1 mT resulted
in periodic oscillations of the rate which are accompanied by
considerable changes of the transverse electron temperature.

these experiments an incident ion beam is merged with a
cold beam of electrons over a distance of typically 50 to
250 cm depending on the speciﬁc electron beam device.
By choosing the appropriate accelerator facility, ions of
most elements in all possible charge states can be inves-
tigated nowadays.

Free electrons can be captured by ions via several dif-
ferent mechanisms. The main recombination channel for
a bare ion is radiative recombination (RR)

e + Aq+ → A(q−1)+ + hν.

(1)

RR is the direct capture of a free electron by an ion Aq+
where the excess energy and momentum are carried away
by a photon. After the capture, which is inverse to pho-
toionization, the electron can be in an excited state and
there will be further radiative transitions within the ion
until the electron has reached the lowest accessible en-
ergy level. RR is a non-resonant process with a diverging
cross section at zero center-of-mass (c.m.) energy which
continuously decreases towards higher c.m. energies.

Another recombination mechanism possible for a bare

ion is three-body recombination (TBR)

I. INTRODUCTION

Aq+ + e + e → A(q−1)+ + e′

Recombination between electrons and highly charged
ions plays an important role in diﬀerent areas of modern
physics. The basic two- and three-body recombination
processes are of very fundamental nature and thus pro-
vide an excellent testing ground for collision theory and
atomic structure calculations. Cross sections and rate
coeﬃcients of these processes are needed for the under-
standing of astrophysical and fusion plasmas and also
provide useful information for applications in accelerator
physics [1]. In particular, beam losses in ion storage rings
by electron-ion recombination during electron cooling can
post harsh limits to the handling and the availability of
ions for further experiments.

During the last decade electron-ion recombination has
been extensively investigated. Merged-beams experi-
ments using storage ring coolers and single-pass electron
targets at accelerators have provided excellent conditions
for a new generation of recombination measurements. In

where the excess energy and momentum are carried away
by a second electron. This process is important at high
electron densities and very low center-of-mass energies
between electrons and ions.

The pioneering experiment on radiative recombination
of bare ions was performed by Andersen et al. [2] in 1990.
Absolute rate coeﬃcients were measured for C6+ with a
merged-beam technique ﬁnding a reasonably good agree-
ment between experiment and theory in the investigated
energy range from Erel= 0 to 1 eV where Erel is the rel-
ative energy between the ensembles of electrons and ions
in the interaction region (for the deﬁnition of Erel see
section III).

In a number of consecutive measurements diﬀerent
bare ions (D+,He2+,C6+,N7+,Ne10+,Si14+,Ar18+) [3–6]
have been investigated at several facilities. The mea-
sured rate coeﬃcients have been in accordance with a
theoretical approach to RR by Bethe and Salpeter [7]

1

for relative energies Erel ≥ 0.01 eV. The experiments
were limited by counting statistics to an energy range of
only a few eV. Recently an experiment with Cl17+-ions
revealed excellent agreement between the measured rate
and RR theory for relative energies from 0.01 eV up to
47 eV [8]. However, in all of these measurements strong
deviations of the experimental ﬁndings from the theo-
retical predictions were found at very low electron-ion
relative energies (Erel ≤ 0.01 meV) . The measured rate
coeﬃcient typically shows an additional increase towards
lower energies resulting in a so-called rate enhancement
factor ǫ = αexp/αRR at Erel = 0 eV of 1.6 (He2+) to
10 (Ar18+) for bare ions (no enhancement observed with
D+) and up to 365 for a multicharged multi-electron sys-
tem like Au25+ [9]. It should be noted that in contrast
to the RR cross section which diverges at Erel = 0 eV
the measured rate coeﬃcient obtains a ﬁnite value due to
the experimental electron and ion velocity spreads (see
section 3).

After the ﬁrst observation of the so called enhancement
phenomenon in an experiment with U28+-ions at the GSI
in Darmstadt in 1989 [10] and a later experimental con-
ﬁrmation of that same result [11] this eﬀect has been
observed over and over again in many diﬀerent experi-
ments at diﬀerent facilities. Whereas the very high rate
enhancement factors of multicharged complex ions like
Au25+, Au50+, Pb53+ and U28+ could be partly traced
back to the presence of additional recombination chan-
nels such as dielectronic recombination (DR) [9,12–14] or
polarization recombination (PIR) [15] the origin of the
observed discrepancies between experiment and theory
for bare ions is still unknown. Theoretical calculations
applying M olecularDynamics (MD) computer simula-
tions [16,17] have been performed by Spreiter et al. [18].
Taking into account the experimental conditions at the
heavy ion storage ring TSR in Heidelberg they found an
increase of the local electron density around the ion. This
could possibly lead to a higher number of recombination
processes but to date the recombination of the electrons
with the ion is not included in their theoretical descrip-
tion.

For the clariﬁcation of this phenomenon dependences
of the enhancement on external experimental parameters
have been studied at diﬀerent storage rings. Variations
of the electron density [6,8] within a total range from
about 106 cm−3 up to almost 1010 cm−3 showed little
eﬀect on the enhancement. The dependence of the to-
tal recombination rate followed the T −1/2
dependence
on the mean transverse electron energy spread T⊥ [19]
as expected for RR alone. A systematic study of the ion
charge-state dependence of the excess rate coeﬃcient for
a number of bare ions [3] yielded roughly a Z2.8 scaling for
atomic numbers 1 ≤ Z ≤ 14. The ﬁrst external parame-
ter observed to inﬂuence the enhancement has been the
magnetic ﬁeld strength in the interaction region of elec-
trons and ions [9]. The experimental results show a clear
increase of the recombination rate maximum of Au25+

⊥

ions at Erel = 0 with increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength.
Recently this dependence has also been observed in ex-
periments with lithium-like F6+ and bare C6+-ions at the
TSR heavy ion storage ring in Heidelberg [20,21].

In the present measurement, which was carried out at
the Experimental Storage Ring of the GSI in Darmstadt,
we extended the range of investigated bare ions to the
high-Z ion Bi83+. It was the ﬁrst experiment of this kind
with such a heavy bare ion providing information on RR
in addition to studies of the radiative electron capture in
ion-atom collisions using x-ray spectroscopy [22–24]. Be-
side a comparison of measured absolute rate coeﬃcients
with calculated RR rates for relative energies from Erel
= 0 eV to 125 eV dependences of the recombination rate
on the electron density and the magnetic guiding ﬁeld of
the electron beam in the cooler have been investigated.
The present paper is organized as follows. After a short
description of the theoretical approaches, the experimen-
tal setup and the evaluation of recombination rates are
described. The experimental results are presented and
compared with RR calculations.

II. THEORY

In order to describe RR theoretically Kramers devel-
oped a semi-classical theory already in 1923 [25]. A full
quantum mechanical treatment was performed by Sto-
bbe seven years later [26]. In 1957, Bethe and Salpeter
[7] derived an approximate formula for the RR cross sec-
tion that is identical to Kramers result

σRR(n, Ecm) = (2.1 × 10−22cm2)

E2
0

nEcm(E0 + n2Ecm).

(3)

The capture of an electron by a bare ion produces a hy-
drogenic state with principal quantum number n. In this
case E0 is the binding energy of the ground state electron
in the hydrogenic ion or atom and Ecm is the kinetic en-
ergy in the electron-ion center-of-mass frame. The total
cross section for this process is obtained by summing up
the contributions of all accessible Rydberg states:

σRR(Ecm) =

nmax

Xn=1

σRR(n, Ecm)

(4)

where nmax is the maximum principal quantum number
that can contribute. This number is generally limited
by experimental conditions. The approach of Bethe and
Salpeter clearly shows the typical features of RR cross
sections: the divergence at zero electron energy and a
monotonic decrease for increasing electron energy. How-
ever, as a semi-classical approximation Eq. 3 is only valid
in the limit of high quantum numbers and low electron
energies, i.e. for n ≫ 1 and Ecm ≪ Z 2/n2Ry. Since
the quantum mechanical treatment of Stobbe involves the

2

rather tedious evaluation of hydrogenic dipole matrix el-
ements one often applies correction factors Gn(Ecm), the
so called Gaunt factors, to Eq. 3 to account for deviations
from the correct quantum result at low n and high Ecm.
The use of Gaunt factors is convenient because they are
either tabulated [27] or given in an easy parametrization
[28]. We here apply tabulated [29] values kn = Gn(0)
using

in beam direction and v⊥ the velocity component perpen-
dicular to the beam. The appropriate velocity (or energy)
spreads are characterized by two corresponding temper-
atures Tk and T⊥. Due to the acceleration of the elec-
trons these temperatures are quite diﬀerent (Tk ≪ T⊥)
resulting in a highly anisotropic velocity distribution f (~v)
which is therefore often called ‘ﬂattened’. Its mathemat-
ical form is given by

σRR(Ecm) =

nmax

Xn=1

(2.1 × 10−22cm2) kn ×

(Z 2Ry)2

nEcm(Z 2 Ry + n2Ecm)

.

(5)

where Z is the nuclear charge of the ion and Ry = 13.6 eV
is the ground-state energy of the hydrogen atom. Eq. 5
is exact for bare ions at zero relative energy and does
not deviate by more than about 5% from the quantum
mechanically correct hydrogenic result at the highest en-
ergies considered in this paper.

For high-Z ions and high relative energies the non-
relativistic dipole approximation presented above is not
valid.
In general an exact relativistic calculation with
the inclusion of higher multipoles is required [30]. Nev-
ertheless experiments investigating the Radiative Elec-
tron Capture (REC) into the K-shell of high-Z ions have
shown that the experimental results are in very good
overall agreement with the non-relativistic dipole approx-
imation [31] as long as Erel is below the electron rest en-
ergy mec2. Because of this observed accordance Eq. 5 is
used for the calculations presented in this paper.

III. BASIC RELATIONS

In the experiment cross sections at very low center-of-
mass energies Ecm are not accessible due to the ﬁnite
velocity spread of the colliding particles. In the present
work the lowest limit of Ecm is at about 1×10−5 eV. The
measured quantity is a rate coeﬃcient α which theoreti-
cally results from a convolution of the cross section with
the velocity distribution function f (~v)

α(vrel) = Z σ(v)vf (vrel, ~v)d3v.

(6)

In our experiment the ion velocity distribution is neg-
ligibly narrow compared to that of the electrons due to
the cooling of the ion beam to a relative momentum
spread below 10−4 and due to the large mass diﬀerence
between electrons and ions. Therefore the distribution
function f (~v) is dominated by the electron velocity dis-
tribution. Considering the axial symmetry of the merged
beams experiment two velocity coordinates are suﬃcient
to describe the distribution: vk the velocity component

f (vrel, ~v) =

me

2πkT⊥

exp(−

mev2
⊥
2kT⊥

) ×

r me

2πkT||

exp(−

me(v|| − vrel)2

2kT||

)

(7)

with vrel being the average longitudinal center-of-mass
velocity

vrel =| ve,|| − vi,|| | /(1 − vi,||ve,||/c2).

(8)

where ve,k and vi,k are the longitudinal velocity com-
ponents of the electron and ion beam in the laboratory
frame, respectively. The relative energy of electrons and
ions is

with

Erel = (γrel − 1)mec2

γrel = h1 − (vrel/c)2i−1/2

.

(9)

(10)

Under cooling conditions vrel is zero and, hence, also
Erel is zero then. For comparisons of experimental results
with theory the cross sections resulting from Eq. 5 have to
be convoluted with the experimental velocity distribution
according to Eq. 6 using the experimental temperatures
T|| and T⊥.

IV. EXPERIMENT

The measurements have been performed at the Ex-
perimental Storage Ring (ESR) of the Gesellschaft f¨ur
Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt [32]. 295.3
MeV/u Bi83+-ions supplied by the GSI linear accelera-
tor UNILAC and the heavy ion synchrotron SIS were
injected into the ESR. Only one shot of ions was suﬃ-
cient to provide an ion current of typically 400-800 µA
at the beginning of a measurement. In the storage ring
the circulating Bi83+ ions were merged with the magnet-
ically guided electron beam of the electron cooler with
an electron energy of 162 kV (Fig. 1). Before starting a
measurement, the ion beam was cooled for several sec-
onds until the beam proﬁles reached their equilibrium
widths. During the measurement the electron energy was
stepped through a preset range of values diﬀerent from
the cooling energy thus introducing non-zero mean rela-
tive velocities vrel between ions and electrons. After each
voltage step a cooling interval was inserted. The whole

3

scheme of energy scan measurements was realized by ap-
plying voltages from -5 kV to 5 kV to the two drift tubes
surrounding the electron and the ion beam in the inter-
action region. The voltages were supplied by a system
of sixteen individual power supplies controlled by very
fast high-voltage switches. This instrument has specially
been constructed for the recombination experiments [33].
Only 2 ms are needed by this device to switch to and set
a certain voltage with a relative precision of 10−4. The
repetition rate of voltage settings with this precision is
limited to 40 per second.

Recombined Bi82+ ions were counted as a function of
the electron energy on a scintillator detector located be-
hind the ﬁrst dipole magnet downstream of the electron
cooler. The dipole magnet bends the circulating Bi83+
ion beam onto a closed orbit and separates the recom-
bined Bi82+ ions from that orbit. In between two mea-
surement steps of 40 ms duration, the electron energy
was always set to the cooling energy for 20 ms in order
to maintain good ion beam quality. The experimental
data stream was continuously collected and stored after
each ms. The time-resolved measurements allowed us to
observe and eliminate drag force eﬀects from the data
in a detailed oﬀ-line analysis. Such eﬀects are a result
of the cooling force exerted by the electrons on the ion
beam which can lead to a time-dependent shift of the ion
velocity towards the electron velocity. The friction forces
are particularly eﬀective at relative energies close to zero.
The kinetic energy Ee of the electrons is deﬁned by the
cathode voltage Ugun, the drift tube voltage Udrif t and
the space charge potential Usp in the interaction region.
Assuming coaxial beams it is calculated as

Ee = −eUgun + eUdrif t − eUsp

= −eUgun + eUdrif t −

Ieremec2

eve

[1 + 2 ln(b/a)] , (11)

where re is the classical electron radius. The quantities b
= 10 cm and a = 2.54 cm are the radii of the drift tube
and the electron beam, respectively. The ion beam diam-
eter is only of the order of a millimeter and, hence, the
electron energy distribution probed by the ions is rather
ﬂat across the ion beam. In the present experiment we
performed measurements with diﬀerent electron currents
Ie which produced space charge potentials ranging from
17.2 V to 51.7 V.

The space charge corrected electron energy Ee and the
ion energy Ei are used to calculate the relative energy of
electrons and ions in the center-of-mass frame. A rela-
tivistic transformation yields

2 (EiEe + Eimec2 + Eemic2 − A) − B,

Erel = p(mic2 + mec2)2+
A = pEi(Ei + 2mic2)pEe(Ee + 2mec2) cos(φ)
B = (mic2 + mec2)

(12)

where φ is the angle between the electron and the ion
beam directions. According to Eq. 12 the minimum rela-
tive energy Erel = 0 eV cannot be reached if an angle φ 6=
0 is present. Therefore the alignment of the beams was
optimized before the recombination experiments in order
to achieve φ = 0 mrad with an uncertainty of 0.1 mrad.
The counting rate measured at the scanning energy

Emeas is given by

R(Emeas) =

α(Emeas)ηLne(Emeas)Ni

Cγ2

+ Rback

(13)

with α denoting the electron-ion recombination rate co-
eﬃcient, η the detection eﬃciency of the scintillator de-
tector which is very close to unity, L = 2.5 m the nominal
length of the interaction zone, ne(E) the electron density
at energy E, Ni the number of stored ions, C = 108.36 m
the ring circumference and γ the relativistic Lorentz fac-
tor for the transformation between the c. m. and the
laboratory frames. Rback denotes the measured back-
ground rate due to collisions with residual gas molecules.
In order to extract an absolute rate coeﬃcient from the
experimental data the background has to be subtracted
by taking into account the counting rate

R(Eref ) =

α(Eref )ηLne(Eref )Ni

Cγ2

+ Rback,

(14)

at a reference energy Eref . Combining Eqs. 13 and 14 α
at Emeas has to be calculated from

α(Emeas) =

(R(Emeas) − R(Eref ))γ2

ηLne(Emeas)Ni/C

+α(Eref )

ne(Eref )
ne(Emeas)

.

(15)

Because of RR one always has a non-zero recombination
rate coeﬃcient α(Eref ) at the reference point. Usually
Eref is chosen such that α(Eref ) practically equals zero,
but in general one has to re-add the rate which has been
neglected by subtracting R(Eref ) from R(Emeas). In the
present experiment the reference rate has been measured
at the maximum accessible scan energy Eref = 125 eV.
According to RR theory the rate coeﬃcient at this energy
is α(Eref )= 3.6× 10−10 cm3 s−1. This correction leads to
a modiﬁcation of the measured rate coeﬃcient at Erel=
0 eV by only 0.2 %.

Electron and ion beams are merged and demerged by
bending the electron beam in a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld
with a bending radius of 120 cm. An electron beam of
2.54 cm radius is still overlapping the ion beam for 25 cm
before and after the straight overlap section of 250 cm.
The merging and demerging sections therefore contribute
to the measured counting rate. As one can see in the left
panel of Fig. 2 where the calculated potential distribu-
tion of the drift tubes for an applied voltage of 1 V is
plotted against the position inside the cooler (along the
central axis of ion and electron beam) the inﬂuence of
the voltage applied to the drift tubes is restricted to the

straight overlap section of the cooler. Thus, the electron
energy in the toroidal sections is always the same inde-
pendent of the drift tube potential. This results in a con-
stant contribution to the measured counting rate which
is considered by the background subtraction procedure
described above.

The right panel of Fig. 2 shows the distribution of an-
gles φ between electron trajectories and the ion beam
direction along the geometrical cooler axis. The elec-
trons strictly following the magnetic ﬁeld lines, the non-
zero angles result from the measured transverse magnetic
guiding ﬁeld components in this section. The measure-
ment was restricted to a length of 2.26 m (90 % of the
straight overlap section) fully including the drift tube
area. As one can see φ increases rapidly at the edges of
the measured range. Using steerer magnets the electron
beam can be shifted to a position minimizing the inﬂu-
ence of angular deviations. Both the distributions of the
electric potential and angle (Fig. 2) can be combined via
Eq. 12 into a distribution of relative energies along the
ion beam axis. Fig. 3 shows the relative energies along
the straight overlap section for diﬀerent voltages applied
to the drift tubes. Obviously the desired relative ener-
gies are only realized along a certain fraction of the whole
interaction length which, in addition, depends on the en-
ergy. The measured rate coeﬃcient at a given relative
energy Emeas always contains contributions from other
relative energies according to:

α(Emeas) =

1

L Z L

0

dl α(Erel(l))

(16)

with Erel(l) being the relative energy at the position l in-
side the cooler. According to Eq. 16 the correct rate co-
eﬃcient can be obtained by a deconvolution which is per-
formed iteratively. In a ﬁrst iteration step the measured
rate coeﬃcient α(Emeas) = α(0) is inserted as α(Erel(l))
in Eq. 16. Then the diﬀerence ∆α(0) between the ob-
tained result and the measured rate is subtracted from
α(0). In a next step the new α(1) = α(0)−∆α(0) is likewise
inserted in Eq. 16 and the diﬀerence ∆α(1) is calculated.
The procedure is carried on until in a step k the rela-
tive diﬀerence ∆α(k)(Emeas)/α(Emeas) is below 10−3 at
all measured energies. This is the case after only a few
iteration steps.

Although the relative statistical errors of the results
presented below amount to less than 1% in the rate co-
eﬃcient maximum, the systematic uncertainty in the ab-
solute recombination rate coeﬃcient has been estimated
to be ±23%.

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND

DISCUSSION

In Fig. 4 the measured absolute rate coeﬃcient of Bi83+
with free electrons is plotted versus the relative energy

5

from 0 eV to 125 eV. The spectrum shows the typical
shape of an RR rate coeﬃcient with a maximum at Erel
= 0 eV and a continuous decrease for increasing relative
energies.

For the comparison of the measured rates with RR
theory one has to know the maximum principal quan-
tum number nmax and the temperatures T|| and T⊥ (see
sections II and III). For the temperature T⊥ character-
izing the transverse motion of the electrons one has to
assume kT⊥ = 120 meV which corresponds to the cath-
ode temperature. For the longitudinal electron motion
kT|| = 0.1 meV is inferred from the analysis of resonance
shapes in dielectronic recombination (DR) measurements
with lithium-like Bi80+-ions performed during the same
beamtime. nmax is determined by ﬁeld ionization in the
dipole magnet which separates the parent beam and the
recombined ions. A ﬁrst approximation of this value is
the ﬁeld ionization limit nF , which is obtained from

nF = (cid:18)7.3 × 1010Vm−1 q3

F (cid:19)1/4

(17)

[34], where q is the charge state of the ion and F =
vi,||B⊥ the motional electric ﬁeld seen by the ions with
velocity vi,|| in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld B⊥ of the
charge-analyzing magnet. In this context one also has to
account for the possibility that high Rydberg states can
decay to states below nF , provided the ions have some
time between the recombination process and the arrival
at the ionizing electric ﬁeld F . Therefore, a realistic es-
timate for the cut-oﬀ is given by

nmax = max(nγ, nF ),

(18)

where nγ denotes the maximum principal quantum num-
ber of Rydberg states which decay before the recombined
ions arrive at the analyzing magnet and thus are saved
from ﬁeld ionization. A crude estimate of nγ based on a
number of assumptions on the population and the decay
of excited states is obtained from a numerical solution of
the following equation [35]

nγ = Z 4/5{2.142 × 1010s−1tF [κ(nγ)]2
[−0.04 + ln(nγ) − ln κ(nγ)]}1/5,

κ(nγ) = 1.6 + 0.018nγ.

(19)

The time of ﬂight tF of the ions between the recombi-
nation act and the arrival at the analyzing magnet in-
ﬂuences the survival probability of ions in high Rydberg
states. In the derivation of Eq. 19 cascade processes were
neglected. They should not be of large inﬂuence consid-
ering the decay rates in undisturbed hydrogenic systems.
A more problematic assumption underlying Eq. 19 is that
the ﬁelds seen by the ions during their ﬂight time are con-
sidered not to change the nl distribution of states as it
results from the initial population by radiative recombi-
nation. Changes of decay rates by Stark mixing in the

ﬁelds are not accounted for but probably deserve further
attention. Also, instead of a sharp cut-oﬀ at nγ or nF a
distribution of ﬁeld ionization probabilities [34] around
nγ or nF , respectively, would be more realistic, how-
ever, these cannot easily be calculated without further
assumptions.
In addition, the inﬂuences of the experi-
mental conditions providing electric ﬁelds via ~v × ~B con-
tributions inside the interaction area, the toroidal ﬁelds
and the dipole correction magnets after the cooler have
to be considered.

In the present experiment nF and nγ have been calcu-
lated to be 116 and 442, respectively. A comparison of
both RR rate curves resulting from Eqs. 5 and 6 is shown
in Fig. 5. As expected the theoretical rate for nmax = nγ
= 442 (dotted line) lies above the curve with nmax = nF
= 116 (solid line). Comparing the experimental and the
theoretical rate coeﬃcients the curve calculated for nF =
116 shows a very good agreement with the experimental
data for relative energies from Erel = 15 meV to 125 eV
(Fig. 4). However, one can also obtain a good agree-
ment for nγ = 442 if one assumes a higher transverse
electron temperature kT⊥ = 250 meV. Such an interde-
pendency between nmax and kT⊥ has also been found in
experiments with bare Cl17+ and C6+-ions at the TSR in
Heidelberg [8,21]. Because of the impossibility to accu-
rately obtain both parameters from a ﬁt of the theoreti-
cal RR curve to the experimental spectrum and in view
of the rather crude estimation of nmax we deliberately
choose nmax = nF = 116 throughout the rest of this pa-
per. This implies a reasonable choice for the transverse
temperature of kT⊥ = 120 meV, which is in accordance
with the cathode temperature. That same temperature
is also suggested by the accompanying DR measurements
with Bi80+-ions. In this discussion the longitudinal tem-
perature Tk does not play a role since it has very little
inﬂuence on the RR rate coeﬃcient.

In Fig. 6 the experimental and theoretical data of Fig. 4
are shown again using a logarithmic energy scale in order
to focus on a comparison at very low energies. The shape
of the experimental spectrum with an additional increase
towards low energies ≤ 15 meV is typical for low energy
recombination measurements. At Erel = 0 eV we ob-
tained a maximum rate coeﬃcient of 1.5×10−7 cm3 s−1
exceeding the theoretical rate of 2.9×10−8 cm3 s−1 by a
factor of 5.2. As already mentioned in the introduction
this rate enhancement phenomenon has also been ob-
served at other facilities, however, the Bi83+-experiment
provides the ﬁrst quantitative determination of the rate
enhancement factor ǫ for a bare ion with Z ≥ 18. As
mentioned above, for the light ions He2+, N7+, Ne10+
and Si14+ a Z 2.8 dependence of ∆α = αexp − αtheo was
found in Stockholm [3]. This scaling cannot be directly
conﬁrmed for Bi83+.
In order to obtain an agreement
with the Z 2.8-scaling the measured rate coeﬃcient for
Bi83+ would have to be more than 400 % higher which
is beyond the experimental uncertainty. However, one
has to be careful with comparing results from diﬀerent

facilities since the experimental conditions vary drasti-
cally. Apart from the extremely high electron energy of
162 keV and the extremely high nuclear charge in the
present case the inﬂuence of the experimental param-
eters kT⊥, kTk and the magnetic guiding ﬁeld B has
to be considered.
It is known from previous experi-
ments with F6+ and C6+ ions [21] that the excess rate
∆α scales as (kT||)−1/2 and as (kT⊥)−1/2. Using the
present temperatures in comparison with the Stockholm
conditions the excess rate found in the present experi-
ment has to be multiplied by a factor of approximately

p120 mev/10 meV · p0.1 meV /0.12 meV ≈ 3.2 in or-

der to normalize it to the Stockholm conditions. This
removes part of the discrepancy mentioned above. The
magnetic ﬁeld dependence of ∆α found in similar exper-
iments with other ions would, however, reduce the nor-
malization factor again. To little is known to date about
the exact numbers for such a normalization.

As mentioned already in section IV the alignment of
the beams has been carefully optimized before starting
the recombination experiment. During the measurement
we artiﬁcially introduced an angle φ between the beams
in order to check the obtained settings. This was im-
plemented by superimposing in the interaction region a
deﬁned transverse (horizontal) magnetic ﬁeld Bx in ad-
dition to the unchanged longitudinal ﬁeld Bz along the
ion beam direction. Fig. 7 shows the maximum recom-
bination rate at Erel = 0 eV for diﬀerent angles φ from
-0.6 mrad to 0.6 mrad in the horizontal plane. At φ =
0 mrad the maximum recombination rate is obtained.
The open circles in Fig. 7 denote the expected rates for
the selected angles. They have been determined by tak-
ing recombination rates from the (φ = 0 mrad)-spectrum
at the minimum relative energies possible at the corre-
sponding angle (see eq. 12). The squares in Fig. 7 repre-
sent the measured rate coeﬃcients at the minimum rel-
ative energies Erel accessible at the selected angles. All
of them are lying above the expected value. Such a be-
haviour is already known from other experiments at the
ESR. Obviously the ion beam reacts on the introduction
of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld component, Lorentz and
cooling forces appear to minimize the eﬀect of the change.
In any case, the distribution shows a rather symmetric
progression with the maximum at φ = 0 mrad conﬁrming
the accurate adjustment of the cooler.

In order to investigate the inﬂuence of the electron
density on the recombination rate we performed recom-
bination measurements for three diﬀerent densities ne =
1.6×106 cm−3, ne = 3.2 × 106 cm−3 and 4.7×106 cm−3.
In Fig. 8 the rate coeﬃcient at Erel= 0 eV is plot-
ted against the electron density ne. The solid line rep-
resents the theoretical rate coeﬃcient calculated with
kT||= 0.1 meV and kT⊥= 120 meV at Erel= 0 eV. There
is a small diﬀerence between the maximum rate coeﬃ-
cient αmax = 1.4 × 10−7 cm3 s−1 for ne = 1.6×106 cm−3
and αmax = 1.5 × 10−7 cm3 s−1 for the two higher den-
sities but this deviation is within the experimental un-
certainty.
In addition Fig. 9 shows that the shape of

6

the spectra is equal for all densities indicating identical
temperatures in the measurements. Therefore it can be
concluded that there is no signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the elec-
tron density on the recombination rate. This observation
is in accordance with ﬁndings at the CRYRING [6], the
TSR [8] and the GSI single pass electron target [9]. The
lack of any density dependence rules out TBR (eq. 2) as
a possible mechanism leading to enhanced recombination
rates at low energies. With a signiﬁcant contribution of
TBR to the observed rates one would expect an increase
of the recombination rate with increasing electron den-
sity in contrast to all experimental observations. In the
context of storage rings TBR has been discussed in some
detail by Pajek und Schuch [37]. They found theoreti-
cally that TBR eﬀectively populates high Rydberg states
of the ion where the electrons are very weakly bound. As
mentioned above such ions are reionized in the dipole
magnet and therefore do not contribute to the measured
recombination rate.

In a next stage of our experiment we also varied the
magnetic guiding ﬁeld of the electron beam between
70 mT and 150 mT in steps of 1 mT. The standard
ﬁeld strength used for the previous measurements was
110 mT. In contrast to the more careful adjustments
of the magnetic ﬁeld at the TSR [20,21] which were ac-
companied by measurements of the cooling force and the
beam proﬁles in order to preserve the beam quality no
other cooler setting beside the magnetic ﬁeld was changed
at the ESR. This procedure was motivated by an earlier
experiment of the ESR cooler group [38] showing an os-
cillation of the recombination rate for 310 MeV/u U92+-
ions induced by small changes of the magnetic ﬁeld. The
new results obtained for 295.3 MeV/u Bi83+ are shown
in Fig. 10 where the maximum recombination rate at
Erel = 0 eV is plotted versus the magnetic ﬁeld strength
B||. Since the measurement of a complete recombination
spectrum is very time-consuming only the recombination
rate at cooling has been recorded for each magnetic ﬁeld
setting. For these data points a background subtraction
and corrections due to the potential and angle distribu-
tions inside the cooler were not possible. Therefore these
recombination rates represented by the open circles in
Fig. 10 can only display the qualitative dependance on
the magnetic ﬁeld.

A complementary method of determining the recom-
bination rate at cooling can be applied by analyzing the
lifetime of the Bi83+ beam in the ring. Fitting an expo-
nential curve I(t) = I0 · exp(−t/τ ) + IOf f to the decay of
the ion current stored in the ring with I0 being the ion
current at the beginning and with IOf f representing the
oﬀset of the ion current transformer, one can extract the
storage lifetime τ of the Bi83+-beam in the ring. Assum-
ing that electron-ion recombination in the cooler is the
only loss mechanism for stored ions one can calculate the
corresponding recombination rate αl = 1/(τ nef f ). nef f
is the eﬀective electron density which is ne times the ra-
tio of the interaction length and the ring circumference.
Fig. 11 shows a comparison of the rates obtained with

the diﬀerent methods resulting in a good agreement of
the data.

A Fourier analysis of the experimental data reveals an
”oscillation period” of the recombination rate of 7.6 mT.
Recent measurements of the ESR cooler group with 300
MeV/u Kr36+,35+-ions show that this value can be inﬂu-
enced by a variation of the magnetic ﬁelds of the toroids
(see Fig. 1) moving the electron beam into and out of the
interaction area . Due to the Lorentz force the electrons
are moving on helical trajectories through the cooler. It
has been observed by the ESR group that the ”oscilla-
tion period” corresponds to a change of the magnetic ﬁeld
that allows the electrons one more turn inside the toroid.
In order to ﬁnd an explanation for these observations one
has to take a precise look at the measured recombination
spectra. Therefore we performed complete recombina-
tion measurements with all corrections for 12 selected
ﬁeld strengths. The results are represented by the full
triangles in Fig. 10. The maximum recombination rates
at Erel = 0 eV obtained in these measurements show the
same progression as the open circles.

In Fig. 12 recombination spectra for diﬀerent magnetic
ﬁelds between B = 109 mT and 114 mT are shown in the
energy range from Erel = 0 eV to 125 eV. For Erel ≥
1 eV the measured rate coeﬃcients are practically iden-
tical. At energies below 1 eV the recombination rates
show signiﬁcant diﬀerences depending on the magnetic
ﬁeld strength. However, the rate enhancement is always
there which one can see in Fig. 13 where the recombi-
nation rate for the oscillation minimum at B = 114 mT
is compared with RR theory.
In order to describe the
experimental data a transverse electron temperature of
kT⊥ = 450 meV was applied which is nearly a factor of
3 higher than the one obtained by a ﬁt of RR theory
to the experimental data at the standard magnetic ﬁeld
strength of B = 110 mT. From the measured rate at Erel
= 0 eV of αexp = 6.6×10−8 cm3 s−1 and the theoretical
value at Erel = 0 eV of αtheo = 1.5×10−8 cm3 s−1 one
calculates a rate enhancement factor ǫ = αexp/αtheo =
4.4.

Analysing all the complete recombination spectra mea-
sured for diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds a connection between
the maximum rate coeﬃcient at Erel = 0 eV and the
adapted transverse electron temperature kT⊥ becomes
obvious which is documented in Fig. 14. In the left panel
representing the data for magnetic ﬁelds between 76 mT
and 80 mT the measured maximum rate coeﬃcient at
Erel = 0 eV (full triangles) increases with increasing mag-
netic ﬁeld whereas the transverse electron temperature
(open circles) adapted to the corresponding recombina-
tion spectra decreases in this region. In the right spec-
trum monitoring the same data for magnetic ﬁelds be-
tween 109 mT and 114 mT one can see a decrease of the
maximum rate coeﬃcient at Erel = 0 eV accompanied by
an increase of the transverse electron temperature kT⊥.
Therefore there seems to be a relationship between the
rate coeﬃcient and the transverse electron temperature
(or: the electron beam quality) which would easily ex-

7

plain the periodic reductions of the recombination rate
at Erel = 0 eV. Nevertheless it should be pointed out that
this interpretation does not explain the observed general
enhancement of the rate coeﬃcient at Erel = 0 eV. A
further theoretical analysis should especially focus on the
possible inﬂuence of the electron energy since in exper-
iments with lithium-like 97.2 MeV/u Bi80+ ions (corre-
sponding to 53.31 kV cooling voltage instead of 162 kV
for 295.3 MeV/u) during the same beam-time the os-
cillations did not appear. This is in agreement with the
results obtained at the ESR and other storage rings in ex-
periments at low ion energies. There, oscillations of the
recombination rate at cooling have not been observed.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The recombination of bare Bi83+ ions with free elec-
trons has been studied at the GSI Experimental Stor-
age Ring (ESR) in Darmstadt. Within the experimen-
tal uncertainty we found very good agreement between
the measured rate coeﬃcient and the theory for radia-
tive recombination (RR) for energies from Erel = 15 meV
to 125 eV. At very low center-of-mass energies between
ions and electrons, however, the measured rate exceeds
the theoretical predictions by a factor of 5.2. This ﬁrst
rate enhancement result for a bare ion with Z very much
greater than 18 does not follow a Z 2.8 dependence of the
enhancement found in an experiment with the light ions
He2+, N7+, Ne10+ and Si14+. Therefore additional mea-
surements in the mid-Z range are necessary in order to
obtain more information about the inﬂuence of Z on the
recombination enhancement phenomenon. The increase
of the electron density in the interaction area from ne
= 1.6×106 cm−3 to 4.7×106 cm−3 appears to have no
signiﬁcant eﬀect on the recombination rate. A variation
of the magnetic ﬁeld from 70 mT to 150 mT revealed a
strong dependence of the recombination rate at low ener-
gies on this parameter. The observed oscillations of the
maximum recombination rate at Erel = 0 eV conﬁrmed
previous observations with bare U92+ ions. Compar-
ing the recombination spectra with RR theory one ﬁnds
strong variations of the transverse electron temperature
connected to the oscillations of the recombination rate.
In future experimental and theoretical studies this rela-
tionship has to be investigated in more detail. Finally,
we want to emphasize, that the observed recombination
rate enhancement signiﬁcantly reduces the lifetime of ion
beams in storage rings during the electron cooling pro-
cedure. At the present ion energies, recombination in
the cooler by far dominates over all factors inﬂuencing
the beam lifetime. The recombination rate enhancement
hence reduces the beam lifetime by approximately a fac-
tor 5 as compared to the assumption of pure RR.

FIG. 1. Schematic view of the ESR electron cooler and the
experimental set-up for recombination measurements. The
cold electron beam produced in the gun is guided by the mag-
netic ﬁeld and merged with the ion beam over a distance of
2.5 m. The electron beam is then separated from the ion beam
by the magnetic guiding ﬁeld and transferred to the collector.
Recombined and parent ions which leave the cooler together
are separated from each other in the ﬁrst dipole magnet af-
ter the cooler. A scintillator detector is used to count the
recombined particles.

FIG. 6. Comparison between the measured rate coeﬃcient
for Bi83+ and RR theory. At Erel = 0 eV a theoretical rate
coeﬃcient of 2.8×10−8 cm3 s−1 has been obtained using kT||
= 0.1 meV, kT⊥ = 120 meV and nmax = 116. The experimen-
tal rate of 1.5×10−7 cm3 s−1 exceeds this value by a factor of
5.2.

FIG. 7. Maximum recombination rates at Erel = 0 eV for
diﬀerent angles φ set between electron and ion beam. The
open circles denote the values expected on the basis of the
(φ = 0 mrad)-spectrum. The measured rate coeﬃcients are
represented by the squares. The diﬀerences at angles larger
than 0 mrad a partially due to the small misalignments in the
magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 2) as well as to the betatron oscillations.

FIG. 8. Inﬂuence of the electron density on the recombi-
nation of Bi83+. The squares represent the measured rate
coeﬃcient at Erel = 0 eV plotted against the electron den-
sity. The solid line shows the theoretical RR rate coeﬃcient
at Erel = 0 eV calculated with kT|| = 0.1 meV and kT⊥ =
120 meV.

FIG. 9. Measured absolute rate coeﬃcients for Bi83+ for
diﬀerent electron densities. The shapes of the spectra are
practically identical. Greater ﬂuctuations of the recombina-
tion rate for ne = 4.7×106 cm−3 are due to the measurement
procedure. For this electron density a random distribution of
the drift tube voltages has been used instead of a continu-
ous increase of the voltage for each measurement step. Com-
parisons of spectra measured with both procedures show the
same progressions but the spectra obtained with the random
distribution are not so smooth.

FIG. 11. Comparison of recombination rates at Erel = 0 eV
obtained via two diﬀerent methods. The open circles show
the recombination rate calculated from the counting rate of
recombined particles. These data do not include the back-
ground subtraction and corrections due to the potential and
angle distribution inside the cooler. Therefore it can only give
a qualitative overview. The full triangles represent rate co-
eﬃcients obtained via the storage lifetime of the Bi83+ beam
in the ring. There is a good overall agreement between the
diﬀerent approaches.

FIG. 13. Comparison between the measured absolute rate
coeﬃcient for Bi83+ at the oscillation minimum at B =
114 mT and RR theory. In order to describe the experimental
progression the theoretical curve was calculated with a trans-
verse temperature kT⊥ = 450 meV. The longitudinal temper-
ature kT|| = 0.1 meV and the maximum principal quantum
number nmax = 116 were the same as before.

Relative energy (eV)

FIG. 12. Comparison of Bi83+ recombination spectra for
magnetic ﬁelds between B = 109 mT and 114 mT. For rela-
tive energies Erel ≥ 1 eV the shapes of the spectra are prac-
tically identical. At energies below 1 eV there are signiﬁcant
diﬀerences depending on the magnetic ﬁeld.

FIG. 14. Comparison of the measured maximum rate co-
eﬃcients (full triangles) for diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds and the
transverse electron temperatures (open circles) inferred from
ﬁts to the corresponding recombination spectra at energies be-
yond 0.1 eV. The left panel represents the data for magnetic
ﬁelds between B = 76 mT and 80 mT. As already displayed in
Fig. 10 the rate coeﬃcient increases with increasing magnetic
ﬁeld. The transverse electron temperature shows the opposite
behaviour and decreases with increasing magnetic ﬁeld. Thus
the magnitude of the maximum rate coeﬃcient at Erel = 0 eV
is apparently strongly related to the transverse electron tem-
perature. This relationship is also present in the right panel
in which the data for magnetic ﬁelds between B = 109 mT
and 114 mT is presented.

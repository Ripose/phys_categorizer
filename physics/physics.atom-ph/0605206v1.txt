Alpha-muon sticking and chaos in muon-catalysed d-t fusion

Sachie Kimura and Aldo Bonasera
Laboratorio Nazionale del Sud, INFN, via Santa Soﬁa, 62, 95123 Catania, Italy
(Dated: September 26, 2013)

We discuss the alpha-muon sticking coeﬃcient in the muon-catalysed d-t fusion in the framework
of the Constrained Molecular Dynamics model. Especially the inﬂuence of muonic chaotic dynamics
on the sticking coeﬃcient is brought into focus. The chaotic motion of the muon aﬀects not only the
fusion cross section but also the µ − α sticking coeﬃcient. Chaotic systems lead to larger enhance-
ments with respect to regular systems because of the reduction of the tunneling region. Moreover
they give smaller sticking probabilities than those of regular events. By utilizing a characteristic
of the chaotic dynamics one can avoid losing the muon in the µCF cycle. We propose that the
application of the so-called “microwave ionization of a Rydberg atom” to the present case could
lead to the enhancement of the reactivation process by using X-rays.

INTRODUCTION

The muon catalyzed fusion (µCF) of hydrogen iso-
topes, especially d-t fusion, has been studied as a re-
alizable candidate of an energy source at thermal ener-
gies. In the liquid D2 and T2 mixture, the muon assists
the fusion through the formation of a muonic molecule,
since the size of the muonic molecule is much smaller
than that of the ordinary molecules and the fusing nuclei
tend to stay closer. After the fusion process the muon
is released normally and again it is utilized for another
fusion. The eﬃciency of the µCF is governed by the
muon-sticking on the α particle which is produced in the
fusion [1, 2]. The muon is lost from the µCF cycle by the
initial sticking(ω0), unless it is not released through the
interaction with the medium. The rate of the stripping
of the stuck muon from the α particle is known as the
reactivation coeﬃcient R and thus the eﬀective sticking
probability(ωef f

) is determined by

s

ωef f

s = ω0(1 − R).

(1)

The determination of the value of R is discussed in the
reference [3]. In this paper we do not take into account
the medium eﬀects which are supposed to be important
to determine the precise value of R in the actual exper-
imental setup. We rather aim to propose a method in
order to enhance the reactivation process, by making use
of the stochastic instability of the stuck muon in an os-
cillating ﬁeld. For this purpose we are mainly interested
in investigating the impact of the regular and chaotic
dynamics [4]. The experimental value of the initial stick-
ing ω0 which is determined assuming the theoretical R
in [3] is tabulated in the reference [5]. In the table the
values of ω0 from 7 separate measurements are smaller
than theoretical estimate for the most part. The direct
measurement of ω0 has been conducted as well and gave
the ω0 = 0.69 ± 0.40 ± 0.14 % [2]. The temperature de-
pendent phenomena in the muon cycling rate and in the
muon loss probability, which is a function of ωef f
, have
been reported on the ddµ at the temperature from 85K
to 790K [6] and on the dtµ from 5K to 16K [7, 8] by mea-

s

suring the fusion neutron yield and the Kα X-ray yield
lately. They have observed that the muon loss probability
increases and the muon cycling rate decreases as the tem-
perature decreases. In the latter case ωef f
varies from
0.64% to 0.86±0.01% as the temperature varies from 16K
to 5K. The temperature dependence in the muon loss
probability is thought to be caused by a change of the
reactivation coeﬃcient R in Eq. (1) [7, 8].

s

At thermal energies, where the µCF takes place, ﬂuc-
tuations are anticipated to play a substantial role. We
investigate the inﬂuence of the ﬂuctuations by using a
semi-classical method, the constrained molecular dynam-
ics (CoMD) approach. As it is well known the molecular
dynamics contains all possible correlations and ﬂuctua-
tions due to the initial conditions(events). In the CoMD,
the constraints restrict the phase space conﬁguration of
the muon to fulﬁll the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
The results are given as an average and a variance over
ensembles of the quantity of interest which is determined
in the simulation. Especially we determine the enhance-
ment factor of the reaction cross section by the muon as a
function of the incident energy. The enhancement factor
of each event indicates the regularity of the system. Sub-
sequently we determine the initial muon sticking proba-
bility, using the phase space distribution of the muon at
the internal classical turning point. A distinctive feature
of our study is that we do not assume the ground state
of the muonic molecule as the initial state of the muonic
molecules, instead we use the initial state conﬁguration
by simulating the fusion process employing the imaginary
time method [9, 10, 11]. As a consequence, in fact, the
muon does not stick necessarily to the ground state of
the alpha particle and this fact plays an important role
when we proceed to the stripping of the bound muon in
the oscillating ﬁeld. The chaotic dynamics could prevent
the muon from being lost in the µCF cycle due to the
sticking. It is achieved by utilizing the characteristic as
a nonlinear oscillator of the trapped muon on the alpha
particle. We draw an analogy between the muonic He
ion in the present case and microwave-ionization of Ry-
dberg atoms [12, 13, 14], where the driven electron in

the highly excited hydrogen atom in a strong microwave
electric ﬁeld exhibits the chaotic dynamics and is ionized.
Since highly excited states in the atom, with high quan-
tum principle number n, are in the quasi-classical regime,
its stability can be explained in classical mechanics in
terms of resonances. We carry out a numerical simulation
by enforcing an oscillating ﬁeld(linearly polarized, oscil-
latory electric ﬁeld) on the system. This can be, likely,
achieved by radiation of a coherent Synchrotron Orbital
Radiation(SOR) X-ray experimentally. The oscillating
force causes the resonance between the force itself and
the oscillating motion of the muon around the alpha, es-
pecially when the driving frequency coincides with inte-
ger fractions of the eigen frequency of the muonic helium.
In other words the muon can be stripped by controlling
the chaos of the system.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we de-
scribe the theoretical framework of the CoMD for muonic
molecule formation and following fusion process brieﬂy.
The relation between the enhancement factor and the
chaotic motion of the muon is discussed in Sec. III. We
develop in Sec. IV a formula to estimate the initial α-µ
sticking probability(ω0) and determine ω0. Sec. V is de-
voted to the discussion of a possibility of muon release. In
Sec. VI we summarize the paper and mention the future
perspectives of this study.

II. FRAMEWORK

The detail of the framework of the CoMD is discussed
in the references [15, 16]. In the following we sketch the
framework brieﬂy, by applying it to the case of muon-
catalyzed fusion

tµ + d → (tdµ)+.

(2)

We assume the ground-state tµ as targets at the be-
ginning of the collision. The ground-state muonic tri-
tium conﬁguration in the phase space is obtained us-
ing the CoMD approach [16]. Denoting the position of
the particles(i = µ, t) in the phase space by (ri, pi) and
the relative distance and momentum between µ and t
by rµt = |rµ − rt| and pµt = |pµ − pt| respectively, the
modiﬁed Hamilton equations for the muonic tritium with
constraints are

The approach gives the average binding energy of the

The value is in agreement with BEH (Mµ/Me) = −2.71
keV, where BEH is the binding energy of the hydrogen
atom, and Me and Mµ are the reduced masses of the the
electronic and muonic atoms.

Using the obtained ground-state conﬁguration as an
initial state, we perform the numerical simulation of the
fusion process (2) using

In order to treat the tunneling process in the frame-
work of the molecular dynamics, we deﬁne the collective
coordinates Rcoll and the collective momentum Pcoll as

Rcoll ≡ rd − rt;

Pcoll ≡ pd − pt,

with rt, rd (pt, pd) being the coordinates(momenta) of
the triton and the deuteron, respectively. In order to ob-
tain the classical turning points, we ﬁrst simulate the
elastic collision. Subsequently we repeat the simula-
tion in the tunneling region by switching on the col-
d ≡ ˙Pcoll and
lective force, which is determined by Fcoll
t ≡ − ˙Pcoll, to enter into imaginary time [10, 11]. We

We assume that the fusion process occurs at small im-
pact parameters compared with the radius of the muonic
atom, i.e., we carry out the simulation of the head on
collisions. Under this assumption, the penetrability of
the barrier is given by [10, 11]

of the collisions using an ensemble of events, we deter-
mine the average enhancement factor ¯fµ and its vari-
ance: ∆fµ = [ ¯f 2
]1/2. These are shown by squares
and error-bars, respectively. Both the average ¯fµ and its
variance increase exponentially as the incident energy de-
creases. The dashed and dotted lines in the ﬁgure corre-
spond to the enhancement factor fµ in the conventional
and exact adiabatic limit respectively (See Appendix).
The average ¯fµ is in agreement with the exact adiabatic

δ-function (∆fµ = 0) and the average fµ approaches 1:
there is no eﬀective enhancement. In the low energy limit

tions, i.e., occurrence of chaos. It is noteworthy that the

slope of the ratio ∆f 2
ergy of the muonic tritium, which we indicated by the
arrows in the ﬁgure. At this point the total energy of
the system is zero. The total system is unbound at the
incident energies higher than this point, while the 3-body
system is bound at lower energies. We indeed verify the
manifestation of chaos by plotting the Poincare surface
of section with respect to the enhancement factor for two
events in Fig. 2. In the ﬁgure we show the surface of sec-
tion for two selected events at the incident energy 0.18
keV on the x-px plane (FIG. 2 left panels) and on the
z-pz plane (FIG. 2 right panels), respectively. We choose
the beam axis to coincide with the z-axis. At the incident
energy 0.18 keV the average enhancement factor, ¯fµ =
2.9 ×1029 as one can see in Fig. 1.
In the top panels,
with fµ= 4.1×1019 (≪ ¯fµ) and the ratio of the external
classical turning point in the presence of the muon to the
one in the absence of the muon ctpµ/ctp0 = 0.15, the
points show a map of a typical regular event. By con-
trast in the bottom panels, with fµ= 2.7×1031 (> ¯fµ)
and ctpµ/ctp0 = 0.06, the points show the map of an
irregular event; the points cover a large section of the
map. The irregular muonic motion leads to smaller ex-
ternal classical turning point. As a consequence it gives
larger enhancements factors opposed to the previous re-
sults in the case of the electron screening [4, 15], where
the irregular(chaotic) events give smaller enhancement
factors. This contradiction is accounted for the fact that
the system is bound in the present case at low incident
energies, while in the previous case even the lowest inci-
dent energy, which has been investigated, is much higher
than the binding energy of the electrons. Therefore the
chaotic dynamics of the electrons causes to dissipate the
kinetic energy between the target and the projectile and
lowers the probability of fusion.

sum of the radii of the target and projectile nuclei. Sim-
ilarly from the simulation without muon, we obtain the
penetrability of the bare Coulomb barrier Π0(E). We
choose the initial inter-nuclear separation 3 ˚A. This is
much larger than the scale of the muonic tritium radius,
which is of the order of 1.3 m˚A.

III. ENHANCEMENT OF THE CROSS
SECTION BY THE MUONIC SCREENING
EFFECT

We introduce the enhancement factor of the cross sec-

tion by the bound muon fµ

fµ = σ(E)/σ0(E).

(10)

where σ(E) and σ0(E) are the real cross section and the
cross section in the absence of the muon, respectively. We
approximate Eq. (10) by taking the ratio of the penetra-
bilities in the presence and in the absence of the muon;

fµ = Π(E)/Π0(E).

(11)

In the following discussion, the enhancement factor is
referred as an indicator of the regularity of the muonic
motion [4, 15]. It plays a role of a sort of order parame-
ter and is determined through the obtained values in the
numerical simulation. In the top panel of Fig. 1 we plot

IV. MUON STICKING PROBABILITY

We estimate the sticking probability of muons on the

alpha particle in the exit channel;

(12)
(13)

where Q =17.59 MeV is the decay Q-value of this reac-
tion. The muon remains bound (eq. (13)), if the binding
energy of the muon on an alpha particle;

BEαµ =

|˙rµ − ˙rα|2 −

Mαµ

2e2
|rµ − rα|

(14)

is negative, in the center-of-mass system of the muon
and the alpha particle. We denote the reduced mass of
µ and α as Mαµ = mµmα
. The eﬀect of the ﬁnite nu-
mµ+mα
clear mass must be taken into account, because a muon
is about 206.8 times heavier than an electron. From this
condition, BEαµ ≤ 0, we deduce the following equation
for the angle θ between ˙rµ and ˙rα.

cos θ ≥

2 (|˙rµ|2 + |˙rα|2) − 2e
Mαµ|˙rµ||˙rα|

|rµ−rα|

≡ g

(15)

The condition Eq. (15) is fulﬁlled when the r.h.s of the
equation g is equals to 1 or less and for the solid angle
Ω = 2π(1 − g) [steradian] in the 3-dimensional space. We
can therefore estimate the sticking probability by Ω/4π,
if g ≤ 1. We point out that |˙rα| in the equation is written
as a function of the decay Q-value:

|˙rα| =

mn
mα + mn

|˙rαn| =

mn
mα + mn p

2Q/Mαn,

(16)

4

where ˙rαn = ˙rn − ˙rα is the relative velocity between the
α and the neutron and Mαn is the reduced mass of the α
and the neutron. In particular, the sticking probability
can be estimated easily in some limiting cases:
CASE 1. if |˙rµ| is about |˙rα|,

g ∼ 1 −

× |˙rµ|/Mαµ ≤ 1

(17)

2e2
|rµ − rα|

2

Furthermore, in addition, we assume that the muon is
bound in the ground state of the 5He at the moment
of the fusion, i.e., − 2e
|rµ−rα| = −10.942 × 2.0 keV, g is
estimated to be 0.89 and thus the sticking probability
is 5.6 %. In passing we mention that g is 0.352 for the
reaction d + d →3He +n + 3.268 MeV under the same
assumptions with CASE 1. We deduce 32.4 % of the
muon sticking probability in this case. If we assume that
two neutrons bring away the maximum energy 9.44MeV
in the case of the reaction t + t → α + n + n + 11.33
MeV [18], we can estimate g = 0.84 and the sticking
probability= 7.84 % for this reaction.
CASE 2. if |˙rµ| is much smaller than |˙rα|,

g ∼

|rµ−rα| ∼ 0.0. This means there is

We remind that muons can have higher velocity com-
ponents in the quantum mechanical system. Turning to
the case of our simulations, the above velocity for the
bound muon is obtained as the average velocity over the
ensemble of events. By inspecting each event, one could
ﬁnd out some events which satisfy the condition g < 1.
Indeed one of the two events shown in the top panels
in Fig. 2, which is regular, has g = 0.93(< 1.0) there-
fore the sticking probability of this event itself is not
zero (3.8 %). While the other in the bottom panels has
g = 1.9(> 1.0), the sticking probability is zero. In the
same way we calculated g for all the events which are
created in our simulation. The resulting sticking prob-
ability of the muon on the α particle is shown in the
top panel in Fig. 3 as a function of incident energy of
the collision with ﬁlled circles. At the same time, we
carry out the simulation of the exit channel by creat-
ing 20000 events(randomly chosen directions of outgo-
ing particles). The time integration of the equation of
motion, Eq. (5) for all the particles(i = α, n, µ) is per-
formed using Predictor-corrector integration scheme. We
distinguish the muon sticking event (13) from the release
event (12) by monitoring the binding energy of the muon
on alpha particles Eq. (14) and the radius of the muonic
ion, Rαµ = |rµ − rα|. We count the events where BEαµ
and Rαµ maintain to be negative and small respectively,
up to the point where the alpha is distant enough from
the neutron. In the bottom panel in Fig. 3 typical tra-
jectories of the distance between the muon and the alpha

which show oscillational behaviors, corresponding to the
sticking events. While 3 other curves increase monoton-
ically after Rnα exceeds 0.01 ˚A. The horizontal straight
line in the ﬁgure indicates the size of the radius of the
ground state muonic He atom. The obtained sticking
probability is shown with open circles with error-bars in
the top panel in Fig. 3. First, as one can see clearly,
the result of numerical simulation agrees with the stick-
ing probability which is calculated considering the solid
angle Ω.
In the ﬁgure we plot the sticking coeﬃcient
obtained from the direct measurement of ω0 [2] with a
solid line with an error bar. The resulting sticking prob-
ability range nearby the experimental value as a function
of the incident energy except for several points, which
have zero and relatively large sticking probability. We
mention specially that the incident energies at which the
sticking probability becomes zero is slightly below than
the ionization energy of the muonic tritium.

V. MUON STRIPPING

Before concluding the paper, we mention that the stuck
muon is possibly stripped from the alpha particle, by en-
forcing a linearly polarized oscillatory electric wave on
the system. The periodic motion of the stuck muon can
be expressed in terms of nonlinear oscillations. For a non-

5

linear oscillator the oscillating driving force, i.e., linearly
polarized, in the direction z, oscillating ﬁeld of frequency
γ and a peak amplitude F of the ﬁeld,

zF sin(γt),

(19)

causes the resonance between the force itself and the os-
cillating motion of the muon at driving frequencies which
are integer fractions of the fundamental frequencies of the
muon. The same concept has been applied in the ioniza-

tion of the Rydberg atoms in a microwave ﬁeld. There
the highly excited atom, Rydberg atom, is prepared by
laser excitation. In the present case of muons, the muonic
He is not stuck necessarily in its ground state. So that the
muon can be ionized directly from one of such an excited
state by the radiation of an electrostatic wave, otherwise
the muon is, at ﬁrst, prompted to an excited state and
then ionized.
In either cases it will be achieved using
X-rays, since the fundamental frequencies for the ground
and the ﬁrst excited state of the muonic He ion corre-
sponds to 0.11nm and 0.44nm, respectively, in terms of
the wave length. Such a X-ray is available from the Syn-
chrotron Orbital Radiation(SOR) facility. In our numer-
ical simulation, instead of the discontinuous frequencies,
we get the proper frequency of the stuck muon for each
event. The frequency is obtained by Fourier transform of
the oscillation and with thus obtained frequency γµ we
perform the simulation of stripping with above external
force. In Fig. 4 we show the time T map of the oscil-
lational motion of the muon on the r − p plane, where
r is relative distance between the muon and the alpha

and p is its conjugate momentum. The time T map is
obtained by sampling the points in the phase space at
discrete times [19]

t = nT (T = 2π/γ, n = 1, 2, · · ·).

We follow 1000 cycles of the driven oscillation in our sim-
ulation. We choose two sticking event which are shown
in the bottom panel in the ﬁgure 3 and the one has
a smaller amplitude, a tightly bound state(top panels),
and the other has a larger amplitude, a loosely bound
state(bottom panels). The left panels show the map of
the stuck muon without external force, with peak ampli-
tude F = 0 of the applied ﬁeld. The map remains in a
limited manifold around r = 0. The right panels show
the case with an external force with driven frequency
γ = 2 × γµ, where γµ = BEαµ/~ is the angular frequency
of the muon in the muonic helium ion, i.e., we are in-
vestigating the 2:1 resonance. In the case of the tightly
bound muon, the muonic atom is excited in a loosely
bound state and then ionized. While the tightly bound
muon is ionized in one step. The muonic atom in the ex-
ternal oscillating ﬁeld is captured into the resonance and
ionized due to its stochastic instability [20]. One can
see clearly that the muon is expelled from the Helium
with the external oscillational force with the correspond-
ing frequency of the unperturbed system. We point out
that the µdt molecule is not destroyed by the external
force with same frequency which we used in the above
discussion.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES

In this paper we discussed the alpha-muon sticking
coeﬃcient in muon-catalysed d-t fusion. We performed
numerical simulation by the Constrained Molecular Dy-
namics model. Especially the inﬂuence of muonic chaotic
dynamics on the sticking coeﬃcient is brought into focus.
The chaotic motion of the muon aﬀects not only the fu-
sion cross section but also the µ − α sticking coeﬃcient.
The irregular(chaotic) dynamics of the bound muon lead
to larger enhancements with respect to regular systems
because of the reduction of the tunneling region. More-
over they give smaller sticking probabilities than those of
regular events.

We proposed a method to strip the stuck muon from
the alpha particle by exposing the system in the X-ray
radiation ﬁeld. Its numerical experiments have been per-
formed under an oscillating external force with the driv-
ing frequency twice as high as the angular frequency of
the stuck muon and the muon has been released success-
fully with the selected frequency. By utilizing the chaotic
dynamics one can prevent the muon from losing in the
µCF cycle by the sticking.

Based on these results, in our future study, we will de-
velop a theory to investigate the temperature dependent
phenomena, including the sticking probability and the
muon cycling rate, which are reported by experimental-
ists [6, 7, 8]. Further quantitative analysis of the muon
stripping with the oscillating force should be undertaken.

APPENDIX: ENHANCEMENT FACTOR IN THE
ADIABATIC LIMIT

In the section III we introduced the enhancement fac-
tor of the cross section by bound muon in terms of the
barrier penetrability. Here in the case of the electron
screening, one often assumes that the eﬀect of the screen-
ing can be represented by a constant shift, Uµ, of the
potential barrier and replaces eq.(10) by

fµ =

σ0(E + Uµ)
σ0(E)

.

(A.1)

(A.2)

(A.3)

σ0(E) can be rewritten in terms of the S-factor S(E)
and Sommerfeld parameter η(E), by writing down the
incident energy dependence of the barrier crossing rates
explicitly [21],

In the limit of Uµ ≪ E, fµ is approximated by

σ0(E) =

e−2πη(E).

S(E)
E

fµ = exp

πη(E)

(cid:20)

Uµ
E (cid:21)

.

The merit of this conventional formula is that one can
easily estimate the upper limit of the enhancement by
using the adiabatic approximation in the framework of
the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
In the present
case of the muonic tritium target it is given by substitut-
ing Uµ = BEt − BEHe ∼ 8.2 keV with BEt and BEHe
being the binding energy of the muonic tritium and the
muonic He respectively. The point is, however, that the
procedure is justiﬁed only in the limit where Uµ is much
smaller than E. Uµ is much larger than the low inci-
dent energies of our interest. The dotted curve in Fig. 1,
which corresponds to Eq. (A.3), indeed overestimates the
enhancement with respect to the exact formula

The exact formula is shown by the dashed curve in Fig. 1

and is in accord with the average enhancement factor
obtained from our simulation.

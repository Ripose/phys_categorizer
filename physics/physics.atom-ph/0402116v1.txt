Using resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization, we detect ultracold, ground-state RbCs
molecules formed via photoassociation in a laser-cooled mixture of 85Rb and 133Cs atoms. We
obtain extensive bound-bound excitation spectra of these molecules, which provide detailed infor-
mation about their vibrational distribution, as well as spectroscopic data on the RbCs ground a3Σ+
and excited (2)3Σ+, (1)1Π states. Analysis of this data allows us to predict strong transitions
from observed excited levels to the absolute vibronic ground state of RbCs, potentially allowing the
production of stable, ultracold polar molecules at rates as large as 107 s−1.

Much experimental eﬀort in recent years has been di-
rected towards the production of polar molecules at ul-
tracold temperatures [1, 2]. Potential applications in-
clude quantum computation [3], study of highly corre-
lated many-body systems [4], and sensitive tests of fun-
damental symmetries [5]. Cooling of molecules, however,
presents a signiﬁcant challenge; their lack of closed opti-
cal transitions and expected inelastic collisional losses [6]
may preclude the use of robust laser and evaporative cool-
ing techniques employed for many atomic species. Suc-
cessful experiments so far have instead used either buﬀer-
gas cooling [1] or Stark slowing [2] to produce trapped
polar molecules at temperatures down to ∼10 mK.

Another promising route involves the formation of het-
eronuclear diatomic molecules out of cold atoms [7, 8, 9],
which allows the success of atomic cooling techniques
to be exploited to reach molecular temperatures down
to the quantum-degenerate regime [10]. Until recently,
however, these methods had been successfully applied
only to homonuclear (and therefore non-polar) dimers
[10, 11, 12]. In our previous work, we demonstrated their
extension to the heteronuclear case, and observed the for-
mation of excited, polar RbCs⋆ molecules using photoas-
sociation of ultracold, trapped 85Rb and 133Cs atoms [7].
We also predicted highly favorable rates of ground-state
RbCs production; however, as in all schemes involving
molecular formation in atomic collisions, the molecules
are formed predominantly in highly excited vibrational
levels. Such levels are likely to be unstable with respect
to inelastic collisions [6], and to have small or vanish-
ing electric dipole moments (in the limit of small bind-
ing energy) [13]. It is therefore desirable to transfer the
molecules to their absolute rovibronic ground state.

In this Letter, we describe the direct detection of ultra-
cold, ground-state RbCs molecules formed via photoasso-
ciation. This is accomplished using resonance-enhanced,
two-photon ionization [11, 14], which also allows us to
obtain extensive bound-bound molecular spectra. From
these spectra we extract the level structure of both the
ground a3Σ+ state (in which a sizeable fraction of our

molecules are produced), and the excited (2)3Σ+ and
(1)1Π states (to which we then resonantly excite them).
We also infer from these observations exactly which a3Σ+
vibrational levels are most highly populated by photoas-
sociation. Finally, based on our analysis we predict that
the coupled (2)3Σ+ and (1)1Π levels that we excite dur-
ing photoionization can be coupled to the absolute vibra-
tional ground state of the molecule with a single addi-
tional photon. This should allow the production of sta-
ble, ultracold, polar molecules in this state at rates as
large as 107 s−1.

Fig. 1 shows schematically the methods by which we
produce and detect ground state RbCs molecules. Two
colliding atoms absorb a photon and are promoted to a
weakly-bound, electronically excited molecular level, a
process known as photoassociation (PA) [11]. They sub-
sequently decay either to two free atoms or a ground-state
molecule, and we detect these molecules using resonance-
enhanced two-photon ionization (RE2PI) [11]. A weak
laser pulse drives a resonant, bound-bound transition
from the a3Σ+ state to the (2)3Σ+ and/or (1)1Π states,
after which the excited molecule is ionized by an intense,
shorter-wavelength pulse. The energy of the ionizing pho-
ton is chosen to selectively form a RbCs+ molecular ion
(see Fig. 1), which we then detect using time-of-ﬂight
mass spectroscopy [11]. Bound-bound molecular spectra
are obtained by scanning the frequency of the ﬁrst pulse,
and monitoring the ion signal.

The 85Rb and 133Cs atoms used for PA were collected
and cooled in a dual-species, forced dark SPOT [15]
magneto-optical trap (MOT) [7]. The atomic density n
and atom number N were measured to be nRb = 7 × 1011
cm−3, NRb = 2×108, nCs = 1×1012 cm−3, NCs = 8×108
using two-color absorption imaging from two orthogonal
directions as well as resonance ﬂuorescence. The temper-
atures of both species were ∼75 µK, measured by time-of-
ﬂight absorption imaging. The PA transition was driven
by a Ti:sapphire laser producing ∼500 mW around 900
nm, just below the lowest atomic asymptote Rb 5S1/2
+ Cs 6P1/2 (Fig. 1). This beam was focused to a e−2

waist size of ∼ 380 µm, producing an intensity more than
suﬃcient to saturate the PA resonances used here. Its fre-
quency was actively locked to the desired resonance using
an optical spectrum analyzer, with the Rb trap laser as
a reference.

The RE2PI laser pulses were both of ∼7 ns duration,
and were separated in time by ∼10 ns. The ﬁrst pulse
had a tunable frequency in the near-infrared (IR), from
8350 → 10650 cm−1, and a typical peak intensity of
3 × 108 W/m2.
It was generated using the output of
a pulsed dye laser operating from 14000 → 18400 cm−1
at 10 Hz with pulse energies up to ∼20 mJ, and a spectral
linewidth ≤ 0.05 cm−1. This output was sent through a
H2 Raman cell (Light Age LAI 101 PAL-RC), which co-
herently produces additional frequency components oﬀ-
set by 4155.1 cm−1 (the H2 vibrational splitting). A
dispersing prism was used to spatially separate the ﬁrst

2

or second Stokes (downshifted) Raman order, which was
directed into the vacuum chamber.
Its frequency was
monitored using a wavemeter with 0.05 cm−1 absolute
accuracy. The second pulse, at 532 nm, had a typical
intensity of of 6 × 109 W/m2 and was derived from the
doubled Nd:YAG laser used to pump the dye laser.

The ions produced by RE2PI were detected using a
channeltron (Burle 5901) biased at -2 kV, ∼ 3 cm from
the atoms. A second electrode on the opposite side of the
atoms was biased at +2 kV. The channeltron current was
digitized during a 2 µs interval after each laser pulse, re-
sulting in a time-of ﬂight mass spectrum like that shown
in Fig. 2(a). The RbCs+ mass peak was only observed
if both Rb and Cs atoms were trapped, and the PA laser
was resonant with a suitable excited RbCs⋆ level. The
Rb+, Cs+, and Cs+
2 peaks in the spectrum arose primar-
ily from the ionization of trapped Rb and Cs atoms, and
Cs2 molecules produced by the trapping light (that is,
independent of the PA laser) [20].

To ensure that we detect RbCs molecules only in their
a3Σ+ or X1Σ+ electronic ground states, the PA laser was
extinguished ∼100 µs before each ionizing pulse, allowing
any electronically excited molecules to decay. By increas-
ing this delay time and monitoring the accompanying re-
duction in the RbCs+ ion signal (due to ballistic ﬂight
of the RbCs molecules out of the ionization beam), we
extracted an estimate of their kinetic temperature. From
the observed decay time of the RbCs+ signal (∼10 ms)
and the measured size of our ionization beams (∼2 mm),
we estimate this temperature to be ∼100 µK, comparable
to the measured temperature of our atoms.

To understand which RbCs vibrational levels are pop-
ulated by PA, we obtained bound-bound molecular spec-
tra by scanning the frequency of the IR pulse, and a
small segment of this scan is shown in Fig. 2(b). The
intensities of the IR and 532 nm pulses were kept suf-
ﬁciently low that neither by itself, nor the two in com-
bination, produced RbCs+ ions oﬀ-resonantly [20]. The
532 nm pulse was chopped oﬀ for every other shot, and
the mass spectra with and without it were subtracted
for each frequency; this removed occasional contributions
from multi-photon resonant processes driven purely by
the IR pulse.

A vibrational progression is clearly evident in Fig. 2(b)
beginning at ∼8770 cm−1, consisting of a series of dou-
blets, which we identify with transitions a3Σ+ → (2)3Σ+.
The observed vibrational splitting of ∼33 cm−1 is close
to that predicted for the (2)3Σ+ state, and the onset of
the series occurs close to the predicted minimum energy
of that state [17]. The doublet structure of each (2)3Σ+
level can be identiﬁed with the second-order spin-orbit
splitting between its Ω = 0−, 1 components, observed
here to be ∼9 cm−1, nearly an order of magnitude larger
than predicted [17].

All of the strong doublets in Fig. 2(b) also exhibit a
characteristic substructure, which arises from the vibra-

tional levels of the ground a3Σ+ state. This is shown in
detail in Fig. 3. The observed splittings agree well with
those we predict for weakly-bound a3Σ+ vibrational lev-
els from ab initio potentials [17]. In addition, since we
observe most of these bound-bound transitions to be sat-
urated, the relative heights of the features directly reﬂect
the population distribution among the various a3Σ+ lev-
els [19]. This distribution agrees qualitatively with our
calculations based on previous analysis of PA spectra [7]
and the ab initio a3Σ+ potential [17]. Note that the
inner turning points of these weakly bound a3Σ+ levels
populated by PA nearly coincide with the minimum of
the (2)3Σ+ state, as shown in Fig. 1; this should result
in large Franck-Condon factors (FCFs) for excitation to
low-lying levels of (2)3Σ+, and explains the ease with
which we excite them. Finally, we note that the weaker
peaks below 8770 cm−1 in Fig. 2(b) exhibit the same
a3Σ+ vibrational substructure, and arise from transitions
from these levels to the coupled A1Σ+ and b3Π states.

Using the observed PA rate inferred from trap-loss
measurements [7], and the predicted FCFs for decay to
a3Σ+ levels [18] from our analysis of PA spectra [7], we
would expect RbCs molecules to be formed in a3Σ+(v =
37) at a rate of ∼ 107 s−1 in these experiments. However,
we cannot yet quantitatively verify this prediction, due to
a lack of knowledge of our absolute ionization eﬃciency
for these molecules. Although the IR step of the RE2PI is
observed to be saturated on most a3Σ+ → (2)3Σ+, (1)1Π
resonances, the 532 nm step displays a more complex be-
havior; as its intensity is increased, broadened resonant
features appear in both the Rb+ and Cs+ channels, indi-
cating that multi-photon processes and possibly predis-
sociation are involved. Based on the RbCs+ signal cor-
0 (v′)
responding to a saturated a3Σ+(v = 37) → (2)3Σ+
transition, and the approximate gain and quantum eﬃ-
ciency of the channeltron, we infer that up to ∼250 ions
are detected per pulse. Given the observed 10 ms time

ponents of (2)3Σ+, v = 4. The dashed lines show the pre-
dicted vibrational structure of the a3Σ+ state [17], and the
solid circles indicate the predicted relative populations. The
absolute position of this pattern was adjusted to match the
observed features, which ﬁxes the (2)3Σ+ level position. Note
that the Ω = 0−, 1 components of a3Σ+ levels and the hyper-
ﬁne/rotational substructure of both a3Σ+ and (2)3Σ+ are not

constant for decay of the ion signal, and the width of
these bound-bound features (∼ twenty times our laser
linewidth [21]) this corresponds to a formation rate of
a3Σ+(v = 37) molecules of ∼ 5 × 105 s−1/E, where E is
the ionization eﬃciency into the RbCs+ channel.

Our bound-bound spectrum extends well beyond the
predicted minimum of the (1)1Π state [17], and we indeed
observe the onset of a more complex level structure near
this energy. Clearly evident in this structure are strong
perturbations due to oﬀ-diagonal spin-orbit interactions

between (1)1Π, (2)3Σ+, and b3Π. These interactions are
of crucial importance for our purposes, since an admix-
ture of the (1)1Π state makes direct transitions to X1Σ+
possible, and allows us to identify a promising route for
producing ultracold polar RbCs molecules in their stable
absolute ground state X1Σ+(v = 0) at large rates. We
have already observed that the a3Σ+ levels most highly
populated by PA can be transferred to any of the cou-
pled (2)3Σ+, (1)1Π levels up to 10650 cm−1. In Fig. 1
we see that low-lying (1)1Π levels should have large FCFs
for transitions directly to X1Σ+(v = 0) (as indicated by
the arrow marked “(e)” in Fig. 1), since the vibrational
turning points nearly coincide.
In fact, from prelimi-
nary analysis of our spectra we predict that these FCFs
are ∼0.1 for a range of low-lying (1)1Π vibrational levels;
thus, a stimulated transition would require only a modest
intensity (in this case at about 715 nm) and could make
eﬃcient transfer from a3Σ+(v = 37) → X1Σ+(v = 0)
possible [22].
It should be pointed out, however, that
at present our a3Σ+(v = 37) molecules are distributed
among several hyperﬁne/rotational levels, and thus only
a fraction of them could be transferred in this way. The
use of a spin-polarized atomic sample in an optical trap,
as well as hyperﬁne-resolved PA to an Ω = 1 level [7]
could potentially solve this problem, and narrow-band
pulsed lasers could be used to selectively populate a sin-
gle hyperﬁne/rotational component of X1Σ+(v = 0).

In summary, we have produced ultracold, ground-state
RbCs molecules using photoassociation. We have de-
tected these molecules using resonance-enhanced two-
photon ionization, and obtained bound-bound molecu-
lar spectra of the ground a3Σ+ and excited (2)3Σ+ and
(1)1Π states. From these spectra we have obtained infor-
mation about the distribution of ground-state vibrational
levels in which ultracold molecules are produced via pho-
further, we have identiﬁed a promising
toassociation;
route in which the a3Σ+ vibrational levels most highly
populated by photoassociation can be transferred di-
rectly to the absolute ground state of the molecule, and
we have demonstrated the ﬁrst step of this process. With
the addition of a laser to resonantly transfer the excited
(1)1Π molecules to X1Σ+(v = 0), we should be able to
produce large samples of collisionally stable, ultracold
polar molecules.

[16] We have also observed features associated with X1Σ+
molecules (using Ω = 0+, 1 PA resonances); however,
these features were weak and hard to assign, due to small
ionization FCFs.

[17] H. Fahs, et al., J. Phys. B 35, 1501 (2002).
[18] Here, the atomic transition dipole is assumed; this should
be a good approximation, since the decay occurs almost
purely at long range.

[19] There are several sharp minima in the strength of the
−1 and 9150
observed lines, e.g. in Fig. 2(b) near 9000 cm
−1. These lines are not saturated, and are suppressed
cm
due to an overlap between a node in the excited vibra-
tional wavefunction and the inner turning points of the
initial a3Σ+ levels.

[20] A fraction of the Cs+ ions, however, were produced from
RbCs molecules via oﬀ-resonant multi-photon ionization
[14] by the 532 nm pulse.

[21] In correcting for the observed linewidth we have assumed
that it is dominated by ground-state hyperﬁne/rotational
structure, and that the excited state structure is smaller
than the laser linewidth and can be neglected; this should
be a good assumption given the small Ω = 0 hyperﬁne
splitting, and the limited number of accessible rotational
levels.

[22] Note that this type of route to the X1Σ+ state starting
from a3Σ+ levels is forbidden in the homonuclear case,
due to the additional g/u electronic symmetry.

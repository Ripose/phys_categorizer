Few-body problems involving Coulomb or gravitational interactions between pairs of particles,
whether in classical or quantum physics, are generally handled through a standard multipole ex-
pansion of the two-body potentials. We discuss an alternative based on a compact, cylindrical
Green’s function expansion that should have wide applicability throughout physics. Two-electron
“direct” and “exchange” integrals in many-electron quantum systems are evaluated to illustrate
the procedure which is more compact than the standard one using Wigner coeﬃcients and Slater
integrals.

For pairwise Coulomb or gravitational potentials, one often expands the inverse distance between two points x and

x′ in the standard multipole form [1]

where r< (r>) is the smaller (larger) of the spherical distances r and r′, and Pℓ(cos γ) is the Legendre polynomial [2]

In the “body frame,” separation distances within the set composed of two points and the origin are characterized
by three variables, one choice being the above triad (r<, r>, γ). With respect to a space-ﬁxed “laboratory frame,”
three more angles constitute the full set of six coordinates, the choice in Eq. (2) of (θ, θ′, φ
φ′) being suited to the
−
spherical polar coordinates of the individual vectors; thus, x: (r sin θ cos φ, r sin θ sin φ, r cos θ).

The multipole expansion in spherical polar coordinates is almost universal because we treat particles or charges as
points. Thus, in the three-body problem, once the motion of the center of mass is separated, we are left with two
vectors which may be described as in the above paragraph, the potential energy and thereby dynamics in the body
frame being a function of the three dynamical variables (r<, r>, γ). In this paper, we present an alternative expansion
to Eq. (1) based on cylindrical (azimuthal) symmetry which may be of wide interest in physics and astrophysics.
As an illustration, we evaluate two-electron integrals expressing the “direct” and “exchange” components of the
electron-electron repulsion in atoms.

The expansion in Eq. (1) disentangles the dynamics contained in the radial variables from symmetries, particu-
larly under rotations and reﬂections, pertaining to the angle γ. Whereas the three variables at this stage are joint
coordinates of x and x′, depending on both and thus characteristic of the three-body system as a whole, a further
disentangling in terms of the independent coordinates so as to handle permutational and rotational symmetry aspects
of the problem is often useful and achieved through the addition theorem for spherical harmonics [3]. Using this to
replace Pℓ(cos γ) in Eq. (1), we obtain the familiar Green’s function multipole expansion in terms of all six spherical
polar coordinate variables x and x′,

expression involves only four combinations: (r</r>, θ, θ′, φ
be, the separation distance being independent of the orientation of that separation in the laboratory frame, and thus
independent of two angles serving to specify that orientation.

−

This multipole expansion is very broadly utilized across the physical sciences. With ℓ and m interpreted as the
quantum numbers of orbital angular momentum and its azimuthal projection, respectively, a whole technology of
Racah-Wigner or Clebsch-Gordan algebra is available [4] for handling all angular (that is, geometrical or symmetry)
aspects of an N-body problem, the dynamics being conﬁned to radial matrix elements of the coeﬃcients (r</r>)ℓ+1/2
in Eq. (1). Although many other systems of coordinates have been studied for problems with an underlying symmetry
that is diﬀerent from the spherical, Eq. (1), in combination with the addition theorem for spherical harmonics, has
gained such prominence as to have become the Green’s function expansion of choice even for non spherically-symmetric
situations.

II. ALTERNATIVE FOURIER EXPANSION

In a recent investigation [5] of gravitational potentials in circular cylindrical coordinates x: (R, φ, z), two of us

discovered and used an expansion

with Qm− 1

We have since uncovered this expansion as an application of the “Heine identity” in the literature [7, 8],

which has a long history but seems not to have been exploited in mathematical physics in recent times. However, we
have found it powerful for problems with a cylindrical geometry and have used it for compact numerical evaluation of
gravitational potential ﬁelds of several axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric mass distributions [5]. We now set Eq. (4)
in a broader context, together with new associated addition theorems and an application in quantum physics, hoping
to encourage wider use of this expansion throughout physics.

The expansion in Eq. (4), may be viewed either, in analogy with Eq. (1), as an expansion in Legendre functions,
), or as a
now of the second kind in the joint variable χ of the whole system, with coeﬃcients (RR′)−1/2eim(φ−φ
φ′) with the Q’s as coeﬃcients. In this latter view, a further step allows us to
Fourier expansion in the variable (φ
develop a new addition theorem for these Legendre functions. Interchanging the ℓ and m summations in Eq. (3), we
obtain

Whereas this expansion has half-integers in the exponents and integer degree Legendre polynomials of the ﬁrst kind,
Eq. (4) has integer m’s in the exponents and half-integer degree Legendre functions of the second kind.

Yet another alternative to Eq. (4) follows upon casting the square root in the expression for the distance in terms

of r, r′, and γ in the form Eq. (6) through the deﬁnition

is equivalent. However, the results directly in powers of r</r> in Eqs. (12) , (13), and (14) are more convenient in
many applications. Among speciﬁc features worth noting in these alternative expansions are that only even powers
of (r</r>) occur in the sum in Eq. (13) and that for any m, the sum in Eq. (12) runs over all ℓ values compatible
with it, ℓ

, as per their interpretation as angular momentum quantum numbers.

In the multipole expansion in Eq. (1), γ is an angle formed out of the set (θ, θ′, φ

φ′) and, therefore, cos γ in
the functions Pℓ has range of variation from -1 to 1. On the other hand, in the expansions in Eqs. (4) and (6), the
arguments v and χ of the Legendre functions of the second kind range from 1 to inﬁnity and, therefore, can be written
in terms of hyperbolic functions as cosh η and cosh ξ, respectively. From Eq. (5) we have the link between them,

III. TWO-ELECTRON INTEGRALS

We contrast usage of the alternative expansions in Eqs. (1) and (4) for calculating the electrostatic interaction
as it appears in atomic, molecular and condensed matter physics. Thus, consider the so-called “direct” part of this
interaction between two electrons in the 3d2 conﬁguration,

The standard treatment [12] uses Eqs. (1) and (3), carries out all the angular integrals through Racah-Wigner algebra,
leaving behind radial “Slater integrals” F k(dd), k = 0, 2, 4, and yielding (for illustrative purposes, all m values have
been set equal to zero)

where the coeﬃcients are evaluated in terms of Wigner 3j-symbols or are available in tables [12]. The Slater integrals,

ee = F 0(dd) + (4/49)F 2(dd) + (36/441)F 4(dd),
V D

F k(dd) =

r2drr′2dr′(rk

remain for numerical evaluation.
In this example, upon evaluation with hydrogenic radial functions, we obtain
V = 0.092172 in atomic units. The alternative calculation through Eq. (4) involves only the m = 0 term and thereby
the integral

The integrand is a function of z and R variables alone and our numerical evaluation of this integral reproduces the
value cited above.

As a second example, we computed an exchange integral for the 3d4f conﬁguration again setting, for simplicity, all

m equal to zero:

The standard method through exchange Slater integrals G and Wigner coeﬃcients gives [12]

ee = (9/35)G1(df ) + (16/315)G3(df ) + (500/7623)G5(df )
V E

and, again through hydrogenic radial functions, gives the value V E
ee = 0.0082862. We reproduce the same result upon
directly computing Eq. (22) with Eq. (4), again involving a single four-dimensional integral as in Eq. (21) with Q− 1
2 .
As the orbital angular momenta involved of the two electrons increase, the number of terms in expressions such
as Eqs. (19) and (23) also grows, necessitating the computing of more Wigner coeﬃcients and Slater integrals. By
contrast, only a single term of the expansion in Eq. (4) and a single integral is necessary in our suggested alternative,
the φ integrations setting m = 0 for direct terms and m equal to the diﬀerence in the m values of the two orbitals for
exchange terms. Of course, the price paid is that four-dimensional integrations are needed unlike the two-dimensional
ones in the Slater integrals. This same selection rule imposed by the φ integrations means that even in a calculation
with several conﬁgurations and the imposition of antisymmetrization, such as in a multi-conﬁguration Hartree-Fock
−1 between each term in the bra and in the ket gets a contribution from only one

IV. SUMMARY

The inverse distance between two points x′ and x is intimately involved in Coulomb and gravitational problems. Its
expansion in terms of Legendre polynomials Pℓ of the angle between the vector pair or a further double-summation
expansion involving the individual polar angles of the vectors are well known and widely used in physics and astronomy.
We have discussed an alternative in terms of cylindrical coordinates, a single summation in terms of Legendre functions
2 of the second kind in a pair variable χ or double summations involving the individual coordinates. These
Qm− 1
expansions are better suited to problems involving cylindrical (azimuthal) symmetry as shown by applications in [5]
and by an illustration here for very common electron-electron calculations throughout many-electron physics. Further
variants are possible for other coordinates such as ring or toroidal, parabolic, bispherical, cyclidic and spheroidal [13],
and we plan to return to them in future publications. Connections to the theory of Lie groups will also be of interest
[14].

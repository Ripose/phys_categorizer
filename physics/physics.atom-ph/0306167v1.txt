Abstract

Quantum interference is shown to deliver a means of regulating the diﬀraction

pattern of a thermal atomic beam interacting with two standing wave electric

ﬁelds. Parameters have been identiﬁed to enhance the diﬀraction probability

of one momentum component over the others, with speciﬁc application to Rb

atoms.

The realization of the eﬀect of quantum interference in manipulating and controlling

atomic and molecular processes has opened up a new area of active investigation in quan-

tum dynamics, called coherent control (CC) method [1]. The approach relies on the cre-

ation of a non-stationary superposition state comprising of two or more eigenstates of the

atomic/molecular system. This is achieved by suitably designing an ultrashort laser pulse

so that only a selective number of eigenstates are involved in the interaction between the

atom and the laser pulse. Dynamics of this superposition state is entirely diﬀerent from

that of the eigenstate in the sense that all the superposed eigenstates contribute coherently

towards the ﬁnal dynamical outcome. The coherence among the eigenstates towards a par-

ticular dynamical observable can be regulated by altering the population of the eigenstates

as well as their relative phases. Although this has been demonstrated lately, in the control

of molecular photo-dissociation [2], optical racemization [3], scattering [4], molecular beam

deposition [5] etc., there are far fewer applications of this new innovation. In this letter,

we report on the coherent manipulation of the diﬀraction of a thermal atomic beam by

two standing light waves thus, providing a useful means towards building mirrors or beam

splitters for atomic interferometers. Several works works have already been devoted to the

diﬀraction process, [6–9] e.g., the Kapitza-Dirac diﬀraction of atoms [8], Bragg diﬀraction

of atoms [9], etc. Classical coherence (due to the presence of two or more optical ﬁelds) and

the eﬀect of the electric ﬁeld conﬁguration in modifying the diﬀraction pattern has also been

studied by some authors [7]. It is thus timely to introduce a diﬀerent method based on the

amalgamation of the classical and quantum coherence where the classical coherence (CC) is

created from the phase relation between two electric ﬁeld and the quantum coherence (QC)

is created out of a pre-preparation of the atomic beam such that every atom in the beam lies

in a superposition state of its eigenstates. The relative contribution of the CC and QC play

a crucial role in regulating the atomic momenta transfer and hence, in the atomic diﬀraction

pattern. Diﬀraction of an atomic beam from a light grating involves the transfer of mo-

mentum from the light ﬁeld to the atoms and this depends on the excitation paths. Thus,

altering excitation paths, much the way it is done in the CC of molecular photo-dissociation

2

[2], would lead to the control in the atomic diﬀraction. Below we describe the theory and

provide the computational results for Rb atom.

A thermal beam of Rb atoms is pre-prepared in a way that every atom in the beam

exists in a superposition state comprising of two of its coherently related eigenstates (atomic

coherence), i.e.,

Ψ(t) = c1(t)e−iE1t/¯h|φ1 > +c2(t)e−iE2t/¯h|φ2 >

(1)

where |φi > are the eigenstates of the atomic Hamiltonian, of energy Ei. This preparation is

achieved by passing the thermal beam through a ultra-short laser pulse decribed elsewhere

[11]. The thermal nature of the beam is characterized by its x-directional Gaussian distri-

bution function g(x) = (πσ2

x , where the full width at half maximum (FWHM),

− x2
2σ2

x)−1/4e

2σx

q

−ln(1/2) of the Gaussian function directly relates to the temperature of the beam.

This is followed by the passage of the beam through two coherently related standing light

waves (optical coherence) whose amplitudes, frequencies and phases can be varied. That is

the composit standing electric ﬁeld E(x,t) interacting with the superposed atomic state is

given by

E(x, t) =

Ej(ωj, θj, x, t)fj(z)ˆk

Xj

(2)

where Ej(ωj, θj, x, t) = E(0)

j fj(x)eiωj t + c.c. with c.c. representing the complex conjugate

of the terms preceeding it, θF = |θ1 − θ2| is the relative phase of the two standing waves

(SW), E(0)

j

, ωj and kj are the peak amplitude, frequency and wave vector of the j-th SW

of wave length λj. This ﬁeld is considered polarized along the z-direction (see Fig.1 for the

general conﬁguration of the proposed scenario). The functions fj(x) and fj(z) are the light

beam proﬁles of the j-th electric ﬁeld along the x and z directions respectively. We assume

the atomic momentum along z is suﬃciently larger than that along x so that light forces

along z can be neglected and the longitudinal velocity vz remains constant. This eﬀectively

means that we can replace z in fj(z) by z = zin + vzt, where zin (set as zero) is the nozzle

position where the beam ejects from. Taking f1(z) = f2(z) = exp(−(z −z0)2/σ2

z ), we replace

3

it by f (t) = exp(−(t − t0)2/τ 2), where τ = σz/vz and t0 = z0/vz represent the interaction

region and the time when the SWs have the maximum intensity. Thus fj(z) represents

the adiabatic entry and exit for the atomic beam. The x-dependence fj(x) is taken as

fj(x) = 2cos(kjx + θj) which means that j-th electric ﬁeld consists of two components which

counterpropagate each other.

The excitation now takes place from the superposition state to the higher excited states

of the atom (see Fig.1 for the atomic transitions driven by the SW ﬁelds). We assume

that the interaction time is suﬃciently small so that the transverse kinetic energy absorbed

by the atoms during the interaction can be neglected (Raman-Nath approximation) and

also that the freqencies of the light ﬁelds are well detuned from the atomic resonances so

that spontaneous emission can be neglected. Thus we have an eﬀective three-level system

interacting with the ﬁeld given by Eq.(2). Within rotating wave approximation (RWA) the

Schr¨odinger equation for this system is

where the initial conditions (τ = 0) are ˜a1(k) = c1˜g(k), ˜a2(k) = c2˜g(k) and ˜a3(k) = 0. If

the intensity of the SW ﬁelds are relatively low and/or the detunings from the resonances

are relatively large, the excitation from the initial pre-prepared state given by Eq.(1) would

be constrained signiﬁcantly and the contribution of ˜a3(k) would remain negligible. This

is often referred to as adiabatic evolution of the initial state [10]. In such case, the light-

atom interaction is equivalent to the propagation of a scalar atomic wave through an optical

potential and the deﬂection of the atomic de Broglie waves by light ﬁelds is exactly analogous

to that of the light by a dielectric medium [10]. The summation index s has two values viz.,

and * represents complex conjugate. The function ˜g(k) is the Fourier transform of g(x).

The scattered wave function of the atom is a superposition of the Gaussian modulated plane

waves with momenta ¯hk=0, ±¯hk1, ±¯hk2, ±¯h(k1 − k2), ±¯h(k1 + k2), ±2¯hk1 and ±2¯hk2.

Thus, in the coherent control method the momentum transfered from the ﬁeld to the atom

has components diﬀerent than when there was no coherence. The momentum ¯h(k1 + k2)

5

(¯h(k1 − k2)) corresponds to the absorption of a photon from the +k1 component of the SW

followed by induced emission in the −k2 (k2) component of the SW and is the result of the

optical coherence.

The output diﬀraction probability which can be measured experimentally, given by

|˜a1(k) + ˜a2(k)|2 represents a comb of images of the split atomic velocities v = ¯hk/m, where

m is the mass of the atom. This output depends on the controlled parameters c1, c2,

θM , θF , τ , σx, E(0)

1 , E(0)

2

and the superposed states, |φ1 > and |φ2 > with θM being the

atomic phase which is the relative phase between c1 and c2. The superposition is created

between |n, l1, m1 > and |n, l2, m2 > Rydberg states employing a two photon preparatory

stage (see ref. [11]), where n refers to the principal quantum number of the ground state of

Rb, li and mi are the angular and azimuthal quantum numbers respectively. The Rydberg

states were evaluated following the quantum defect theory. Thus, the process of excita-

tion to the state |φ3 > occurs through three diﬀerent paths viz., (1) the path that ends

at |φ3 > from |n, l1, m1 >, the probability of which is proportional to |c1|2, (2) the path

that ends at |φ3 > from |n, l2, m2 >, the probability of which is proportional to |c2|2 and

(3) the path that ends at |φ3 > through the interference between the paths (1) and (2),

the probability of which is proportional to |c1c2|cosθM , where θM can be controlled during

the preparation of the superposition state. We chose the frequency of the SW ﬁelds as

ωj = Min{|E2 − E1|/¯h, |E3 − E1|/¯h, |E3 − E2|/¯h} + ∆j which gives the detunings deﬁned in

Eq.(3) as ∆m,n

j = 1/¯h(En − Em) − Min{|E2 − E1|/¯h, |E3 − E1|/¯h, |E3 − E2|/¯h} − ∆j where m

and n run from 1 to 3. In the calculation below for Rb atomic beam we chose ∆1 = 53051.6
cm−1 and ∆2 = 477464.8 cm−1 which ensure adiabatic evolution of the initial state. This

means that the ﬁrst and the second SW ﬁelds are detuned by ∆1 and ∆2 respectively from

the minimum of the atomic resonances.

As an example, we examine the diﬀraction where the beam is peaked about zero along

the transverse direction with a FWHM=5.5 µm which means the initial transverse spread

(FWHM) of the atomic wave vector FWHM=0.504 µm−1. This gives high resolution in the

diﬀraction pattern of Rb beam as shown in Fig.2 for |˜a1(k)|2 (label a), |˜a2(k)|2 (label b),

6

|˜a1(k)|2 + |˜a2(k)|2 (label c) and |˜a1(k) + ˜a2(k)|2 (label d). Time integration is performed over

a time period t = −5 × F W HMt to t = 5 × F W HMt, where F W HMt = 2τ

−ln(1/2)

q

is the full width at half maximum of the gaussian time proﬁle centered at t0 = 0. In the

computation we have taken F W HMt = 5µs which means that the superposed atomic beam

interacts with the standing wave ﬁelds for a total duration of 50 µs [12], during which the

ﬁelds become maximum at t=25 µs. In other words, for a ﬁxed longitudinal velocity [13]

vz = 500m/s the ﬁeld is maximum at distant of 12.5 mm from the nozzle.

In Fig.2 we

observed the splitting of the beam into a total of 9 velocity components, of which the k=0

is the most peaked. For the standing wave ﬁelds with λ1 = 0.897µm (k1 = 7.004µm−1)
and λ2 = 1.45µm (k2 = 4.338µm−1) the beam splits at k=0, 11.332, -11.332, 2.666, -
2.666, 14.008, -14.008, 8.676 and -8.676 µm−1. We observed that the incorporation of more

coherence (optical) through the introduction of more SW ﬁelds will give rise to the splitting

of the atomic beam into a wide range of velocity components. Qualitative consideration of

the pattern reveals that they are in general agreement with the theory [14]. That is, the

atom absorbs photon from the +kj components followed by induced emission in the −kj′

components of the standing wave where j and j′ can be 1 and/or 2.

We compute the relative diﬀraction probabilities of any two diﬀerent momenta com-

ponents Pk′k′′ = P (k′)/P (k′′) where P (k′) and P (k′′) are the total diﬀraction probabili-
ties corresponding to the atomic momenta ¯hk′ and ¯hk′′ respectively. This P (k′) is com-

puted by ﬁltering out all the momenta components in the diﬀraction proﬁle excepting

the one centered at k′ and then integrating over the entire momentum coordinate, i.e.,

P (k′) =

|˜a1(k) + ˜a2(k)|2F (k, k′)dk, where F (k, k′) is the ﬁlter chosen properly. Consid-

R

eration of the equations for ˜a1(k) and ˜a2(k) (Eqs. (4) and (5)) show that the changes in

the control parameters can strongly aﬀect Pk′k′′, in other words, we can control the degree

of splitting of one of the atomic velocity component over the others. The following ﬁgures

(Fig.3-5) show the dependence of Pk′k′′ on atomic phase θM (Fig.3), |c1|2/|c2|2 (Fig.4) and the

optical phase θF (Fig.5). All these ﬁgures show signiﬁcant control of the diﬀraction probabil-

ity of a given momentum component over the others by varying the controlled parameters.

7

For example, Fig.3 (label c) show that the diﬀraction probability of k=0 component of the

atomic wave vector is nearly 58 times that of the k = 2k2 component at θM = 0.57 radian,

i.e., P (0) ≈ 58P (2k2). This gets altered at θM = 3.74 radian when the diﬀraction proba-

bility of the k = 2k2 component become nearly 11 times that of the k=0 component. Take

another example, Fig.4 (label j), where we see that the diﬀraction probability of k = 2k2 is

roughly 12 times that of k = 2k1 for θM = −3.2 radian which totally reverses in favor of the

k = 2k1 component at θM = −0.45 radian when P (2k1) ≈ 11P (2k2). Thus the atomic phase

causes a signiﬁcant control on the diﬀraction probabilities of the atomic beam for ﬁxed |c1|2

and |c2|2 (Fig.3).

Consider now the control over the Rb beam where initially |c1|2 × 100 precentage of the

atoms lie in the state |5, 0, 0 > and the rest in the state |5, 2, 0 >. Results for such case

are shown in Figs.4 where we plot the logarithms of the relative diﬀraction probabilities

of two diﬀerent atomic wave vector components for varying |c1|2/|c2|2. Results show near

monotonic decrease of P (0)/P (k1−k2), P (0)/P (k1+k2), P (0)/P (2k2) and P (0)/P (2k1) with

the increase in |c1|2/|c2|2 for up to |c1|2/|c2|2 ≈ 3.5, after which they become nearly constant

(Fig.4a). Whereas P (k1 − k2)/P (k1 + k2), P (k1 − k2)/P (2k2), P (k1 − k2)/P (2k1), P (k1 +

k2)/P (2k2), P (k1 + k2)/P (2k1), P (2k2)/P (2k1) increase monotonically with the increase in

|c1|2/|c2|2 for up to |c1|2/|c2|2 ≈ 3.5 and then become constant (Fig.4 b, c, d). Finally, Fig.5

depicts the control of the relative diﬀraction probabilities of two diﬀerent atomic wave vectors

for varying optical phase θF , where we again observe several-fold increase (or decrease) of

diﬀraction probabilities of a particular atomic wave vector over the other.

The present work takes into account the experimental issues, e.g., (1) the experimental

noise is taken care of by considering a gaussian thermal beam and (2) the entry and the exit

of the atomic beam in its interaction with the SW ﬁelds is described by a gaussian envelope

in the calculation. The parameters in the present calculation have been chosen carefully so

as to commensurate with the Rb atom and the assumptions that the spontaneous emission

is negligible and Raman-Nath regime is valid. These assumptions do not pose any obstacle

in the real experimental scenario, they mere conﬁne the intensity and the frequency of the

8

SW ﬁelds within certain values.

In conclusion, we have shown that one can achieve signiﬁcant control on the diﬀraction

probability of a thermal atomic beam through the introduction of the atomic and optical

coherences. Although we have introduced atomic coherence by two-state superposition sce-

nario, a more general approach should be the preparation of the superposition state by an

arbitrary numbers of atomic eigenstates accessible to the preparatory electric ﬁeld. This

would immediately introduce more parameters and hence more control over the diﬀraction

pattern.

[12] Time of interaction plays a crucial role in the sense that τ must be less that T/4, where

T is the optical period of the atom in the potential well V (x) = −1/2αE2(x). Here α

is the polarizability of the Rb atom and E(x) is the electric ﬁeld with the time variable

integrated out (see ref. [5]).

[13] More detail study would require assigning the beam a proper transverse velocity proﬁle

corresponding to its transverse temperature. However, this does not alter the results in

the present computation because of the fact that the atoms do not experience any force

along the transverse direction.

Collision rates in near-resonant optical lattices

Jyrki Piilo
Helsinki Institute of Physics, PL 64, FIN-00014 Helsingin yliopisto, Finland

We present a simple method to calculate the binary collision rate between
atoms in near-resonant optical lattices. The method is based on the Monte
Carlo wave function simulations and the collision rate is obtained by monitoring
the quantum ﬂux beyond the average distance between the atoms. To illustrate
the usefulness of the method, we calculate the collision rates for a wide range
of occupation densities and various modulation depths of the lattice. The
method presented here combined with the semiclassical calculations accounting
for intra-well collisions can simplify the study of the eﬀects of binary collisions
on the dynamics of atomic clouds trapped in near-resonant optical lattices.

Introduction

A periodic polarization or intensity gradient of a laser
ﬁeld can create a periodic optical potential structure for
atoms. When atoms move in this structure, they may
undergo Sisyphus cooling, and ﬁnally localize into the
optical lattice sites1,2,3,4,5,6,7. After localization, atoms
are still able to move around in the lattice. The optical-
pumping-induced motion typically dominates in near-
resonant optical lattices, whereas in shallow far-oﬀ reso-
nant lattices the quantum mechanical tunneling of atoms
between the lattice sites may dominate the atomic mo-
tion. Because of their ability to move between the lattice
sites, two atoms may end up in the same site and collide.
The purpose of this paper is to present a simple method
to calculate the binary collision rate in a near-resonant
optical lattice.

Cold collisions have been widely studied in magneto-
optical traps8,9. This is not the case for optical lattices
where the complications arise due to the position depen-
dent coupling between the multi-level atoms and the laser
ﬁeld. So far, to the best of our knowledge, there has
been only a few experimental cold collision studies in
optical lattices10,11. Theoretical studies of the interac-
tions between atoms in optical lattices include the mean-
ﬁeld type approaches12,13,14,15,16, and Monte Carlo wave
function (MCWF) simulations of binary collisions in red
detuned17,18 and blue detuned lattices19. However, the
mean-ﬁeld approaches neglect the dynamical nature of
the collisions, and the MCWF simulations for two atoms
colliding in optical lattice require extremely large com-
puter resources18.
It would therefore be useful to ﬁnd
a way to do a dynamical study of collisions in near res-
onant optical lattices without the requirement of heavy
computational resources.

We present here a simple method to calculate the
rate of binary collisions in near-resonant optical lattices.
The method is based on single-atom MCWF simula-
tions20,21,22,23,24,25 and the key idea is to monitor a quan-
tum ﬂux beyond the average distance za between the

atoms in a densely populated lattice. The accumulation
of the atomic population beyond za gives information
about the atomic quantum transport in a lattice and can
be monitored by MCWF simulations for one atom. Thus,
our method avoids the requirement of large computa-
tional resources of the two-atom MCWF collision simu-
lations17,18,19.

To illustrate the usefulness of the method we calcu-
late the collision rates for various modulation depths and
occupation densities of one dimensional optical lattices.
Moreover, we show that it is possible to obtain accurate
collision rates for all the densities from only a few sim-
ulations for a given lattice. The simulation results show
a quadratic behaviour of the binary collision rate as a
function of density.

It has been shown before that, in the parameter regime
we use here, the atomic motion between the lattice sites
is to a good approximation dominated by the laser-atom
interactions 17,18. The eﬀects of the interactions between
atoms come into play as soon as the two atoms try to oc-
cupy the same lattice site and collide. Thus the combina-
tion of the method presented here to calculate the binary
collision rate, and the semiclassical methods accounting
the eﬀects of intra-well collisions 8,9,26, can simplify the
study of the eﬀects of collisions on the dynamics of the
atomic cloud trapped in a near-resonant optical lattice.
We present the lattice structure and our calculation
method of the collision rate in the next section, the re-
sults for various lattice depths and occupation densities
in Section 3, and conclude with the discussion in Section
4.

2. Optical lattice and collision rate

A. Sisyphus cooling in optical lattice

We consider here atoms having ground state angular mo-
mentum Jg = 1/2 and excited state angular momentum
Je = 3/2 corresponding to alkali metal elements when the
hyperﬁne structure is neglected, and use the atomic mass
M of 133Cs. The resonance frequency between the states

The periodic polarization gradient of the laser ﬁeld and
the subsequent periodicity of the couplings between the
atomic states are reﬂected in the periodic light shifts (ac-
Stark shifts) of the atomic sublevels creating the optical
lattice structure. When the atomic motion occurs in a
suitable velocity range, optical pumping of the atom be-
tween the ground state sublevels reduces the kinetic en-
ergy of the atom 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, and the atom is cooled.

When the steady state is reached after a certain period
of cooling, atoms are to a large extent localized into the
optical potential wells. In this study we deal with near-
resonant optical lattices where the laser ﬁeld is detuned a
few atomic linewidths to the red of the atomic transition.
Thus, after localization atoms may still move around in
the lattice due to the ﬁnite extent of the atomic wave
packet and scattering of photons which transfers the pop-
ulation between the various ground state sublevels and
corresponding optical potentials via the optical pumping
mechanism.

Because the atoms are able to move between the lattice
sites, they may try to occupy the same site and collide.
The purpose of this paper is to ﬁnd a simple way to calcu-
late the binary collision rate without the need to perform
complicated two-atom simulations. We use the occupa-
tion densities ρ0 of the lattice between 14.2% and 25.0%
corresponding to cases with every seventh and fourth site
occupied respectively. Other relevant parameters are pre-
sented in Table 1. From the simulation results, it is pos-
sible to calculate the collision rates for a wide range of
occupation densities of the lattice, see Section 4.

B. Calculation of collision rate

1. Monitoring the quantum ﬂux

The key idea in our method is to monitor the quantum
ﬂux beyond the average distance za between the atoms in
the one dimensional lattice. Since the distance between
the nearest neighbour lattice sites is λ/4, then, e.g., za =
λ corresponds to the occupation density ρ0 = 25% of the
lattice. Here λ is the wavelength of the lattice lasers.

To get the value for a collision rate we need to know
how many atoms have travelled into the accumulation

about the quantum ﬂux into the accumulation region, in
other words the cumulative population in the accumula-
tion region as a function of time. This means that we
should be able to make the quantum ﬂux unidirectional
into
> za. The atoms should therefore be able to
arrive into the accumulation region due to their random
motion in the lattice but should not be allowed to leave.
In this case the accumulation rate of the atomic popula-
tion into the accumulation region could give us the binary
collision rate in the lattice.

the average kinetic energy of the atoms in the region

When an atom arrives into a lattice site located around
za, corresponding to a collision site, it is pushed into
±
the accumulation region and is not allowed to climb back
< za. This does not change the physics

for region
< za before the atom reaches collision site.
z
|
After arrival the atom is captured into the accumulation
region and as a consequence it is easy to calculate the
cumulative population as a function of time. The trick
here is that the drop in energy can not be too large but
has to be large enough: Sisyphus cooling should still be
eﬀective in accumulation region, preventing the atoms
from simply bouncing back from the wall of the grid and
traveling back to
< za; but the energy drop has to be
large enough so that the probability to climb the energy
barrier from the accumulation region should be small.
We have chosen the values α = 375, 840, 1356Er for U0 =
259, 580, 936Er respectively.

The total Hamiltonian for the time evolution of the

system now reads

H = Hs + Hm + Hd,

(9)

where Hs is the system Hamiltonian from Eq. (4), Hm
the optical potential modiﬁcation from Eq. (8), and Hd
includes the non-Hermitian decay part of the MC method
(see below).

2. Monte Carlo wave function method

We use the MCWF method (see Refs. 20-23.
for de-
tails, and, e.g., Refs. 24-26 for applications of the method
to the cold collision problems) to calculate the collision
rates. We have also applied the method recently to study
heating in red-detuned17,18 and optical shielding in blue-
detuned lattices19.

for the two ground state Zeeman sublevels. The initial
lattice site of the wave packet is indicated by the arrow
and the modiﬁcation of the potentials around the points
za makes the quantum ﬂux unidirectional into the ac-

±
cumulation region (shown as shaded area).

The core idea of the MCWF method is to generate
a large number of single wave function time evolution
histories which include stochastic quantum jumps. The
jumps occur because of the non-Hermitian part Hd in the
system Hamiltonian. The information about the decay
of the system is included in Hd, which shrinks the norm
of the wave function and gives the jump probability for
each time step taken28. The results for the system prop-
erties are ﬁnally obtained as an ensemble average of the
generated single wave function histories.

The initial position of the wave packet in our simula-
tions is given randomly into the lattice well around the
point z = 0 (see Fig. 1), and with zero mean momen-
tum. Strictly speaking we should use as initial position
and momentum distributions the steady state distribu-
tions for the used lattice parameters. We emphasize that
the time scale to achieve the steady state is short com-
pared to the population accumulation time to the accu-
mulation region and we have checked that the change
of the initial conditions does not change the simulation
results. Thus, we avoid doing the double eﬀort (ﬁrst cal-
culating the steady state properties of the system and
then the collision rate) but still get the correct results.
If one does simulations for higher occupation densities
than used here (which is not actually necessary since the
simulation results calculated here can be used to obtain
the rate curve for wide range of densities, see Section 3),
then more care should be given to the initial conditions
of the system.

The number of the generated wave function histories
per simulation varies from 256 to 320 and the total sim-
ulation times vary from 3200Γ−1 to 6400Γ−1.

3. Results

We have simulated the binary collision rate R for three
diﬀerent lattice depths U0 with ﬁxed detuning δ =
3Γ (see Table 1), and for lattice occupation densities
−
ρ0 = 14.3%, 16.7%, 20%, 25%, from every seventh to ev-
ery fourth lattice site occupied respectively. The results
are displayed in Fig. 3.

The simulation results show a quadratic behaviour of R
with respect to atomic density29. Thus we can obtain the
whole collision rate curve for all densities of the speciﬁc

lattice by calculating R from only a single density MC
result. By dividing the result for R with the square of the
density it is possible get the factor of quadratic behaviour
for all densities. We note that this might be vulnerable to
statistical error typical for MC simulations. To improve
the statistical accuracy of the result for all densities we
take the average of the quadratic factors obtained for
the diﬀerent densities. This makes it possible to obtain
the whole collision rate curve for all the densities of the
speciﬁc lattice with good statistical accuracy. The ﬁnal
results for all the density range obtained by averaging
the various density MC results are drawn with solid lines
in Fig. 3.

In the parameter regime we use, the motion between
the lattice sites is mainly due to optical pumping, not
because of the tunneling between the lattice sites. The
higher is U0, the larger is the collision rate. For ﬁxed de-
tuning the increasing ﬁeld intensity means higher U0 and
shorter optical pumping time. The atoms get more mo-
bile since the increasing excited state population makes
the probability of the internal state changing sponta-
neous emission event higher. If the atomic motion be-
tween lattice sites was because of tunneling, then the
collision rate would decrease for tightly bound atoms for
larger lattice modulation depths.

Moreover, the atomic motion between the lattice sites
is not simply a random walk with a step size of the lat-
tice constant. When the atom changes its internal state
and optical potential well, it is not necessary that the
atom halts its motion already in the nearest neighbour
site. The atom may travel the distance of several lattice
constants with a single ﬂight, in fact, for the shallow opti-
cal lattices the atomic motion and diﬀusion in the lattice
may even be anomalous and include L´evy walks 30,31.
For the parameters we use, the diﬀusion is normal32,33.

r
G
Since the atomic motion between the lattice sites here
is due to optical pumping it is useful to compare the
ratios of calculated collision rates of the various lattice
depths to the corresponding ratios of the optical pump-
ing times. The ratio of the optical pumping times for
two diﬀerent lattice depths with equal detuning is sim-
ply given by the square of the ratio of Rabi frequencies27.
Here the ratio of the optical pumping times is on the
same order of magnitude as the calculated ratios of the
collision rates, but there can be a diﬀerence of factor of
two. They do not match exactly because there is more
to atomic motion between the sites than optical pump-
ing only. For example the hopping statistics between the
sites may diﬀer for various lattice depths.

4. Discussion and conclusions

We have presented a method to calculate the binary colli-
sion rate R in a steady state for an atomic cloud trapped
in a near-resonant optical lattice. The method is based
on MCWF simulations and the key idea is to monitor the
quantum ﬂux beyond the average distance between the
atoms.

We have done the MCWF simulations for near-
3Γ, and for lattice depths 259Er 6
resonant lattice, δ =
U0 6 936Er. From the MCWF results it is possible to
calculate the quadratic collision rate curve for all the den-
sities of the lattice, within some limitations though (see
below).

−

The advantage of the method is the avoiding of the
large computational resource requirements of two-atom
simulations. This is possible because in near-resonant
lattices with large enough modulation depths the atomic
motion between lattice sites is dictated by the ﬁeld-atom
interactions only 17,18. The interactions between the
atoms come into play only when two atoms try to oc-
cupy the same lattice site and collide (this is not the case
for all parameter ranges, see Ref. 13). The method is also
fast, straightforward, and fully quantum-mechanical.

In addition of giving quantitative estimate for the num-
ber of collisions in the experiment for a wide density
range of optical lattices, our method brings out the pos-
sibility to combine two simple and computationally light
methods to study collisions in optical lattices. Namely,
the method presented here, combined with the semiclas-
sical calculations accounting for the intra-well collision
eﬀects8,9,26, would simplify the study of the eﬀects of the
dynamic binary collisions for the atomic clouds trapped
in optical lattices.

We have actually calculated here the collision rate for
the primary collisions in the lattice. That is: the atomic
cloud achieves the steady state and it is the steady state
properties which deﬁne the collision rate here. Naturally
the dynamics of the cloud may change when a large frac-
tion of the atoms collide in short time for high occupation
densities of the lattice. Moreover, the occupation density
may change if the collided atoms gain enough kinetic en-
ergy to leave the lattice, or if the lattice is constructed

5

for metastable atoms10,11, which may ionize and escape
the lattice when colliding. This is actually a beneﬁt when
using metastables, since it would be straightforward, at
least in principle, to compare the number of collisions
given by the method presented here and in the experi-
ment.

We have to neglect the rescattering of photons. It is
practically impossible account the rescattering eﬀects be-
cause of ﬁnite amount of available computer resources.
Despite of this, we think that our study is useful because
of two reasons: a) we can give results for collision rates in
the density region where the rescattering eﬀects do not
appear, b) because for very high densities (where rescat-
tering eﬀects should be accounted in principle) one could
still use the method presented here to study the aspects
of the binary collision eﬀects on the lattice dynamics of
the atomic cloud. This in itself is very complex problem,
and also worth studying17,18,19.

From a Monte Carlo method point of view there is an
interesting feature present here. Namely, we ﬁrst do a
few simulations and notice that the binary collision rate
has a quadratic behaviour with respect to the atomic
density. As a second step, we obtain the ﬁnal results by
taking the average of the various sets of MC results. We
emphasize that this method diﬀers from a simple increase
of the number of histories in the MC ensemble to increase
the statistical accuracy. Thus the beneﬁts here are (in
addition to the ones mentioned in previous paragraphs)
twofold a) the statistical accuracy of the results increases
b) the result can be obtained in a wider range than in
which the MC simulations are done. This is a new feature
in MCWF simulations to our knowledge, at least when
MCWF method is applied to cold collision problems.

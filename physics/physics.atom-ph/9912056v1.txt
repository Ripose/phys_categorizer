Analytical Structure Matching and

Very Precise Approach to the Coulombic

Quantum Three-Body Problem

Institute of Theoretical Physics, CAS, P.O.Box 2735, Beijing 100080, P.R.China

TAN, Shi-Na ∗

Abstract

A powerful approach to solve the Coulombic quantum three-body problem is proposed. The

approach is exponentially convergent and more eﬃcient than the Hyperspherical Coordinate(HC)

method and the Correlation Function Hyperspherical Harmonic(CFHH) method. This approach is

numerically competitive with the variational methods, such as that using the Hylleraas-type basis

functions. Numerical comparisons are made to demonstrate them, by calculating the non-relativistic

& inﬁnite-nuclear-mass limit of the ground state energy of the helium atom. The exponentially

convergency of this approach is due to the full matching between the analytical structure of the

basis functions that I use and the true wave function. This full matching was not reached by almost

any other methods. For example, the variational method using the Hylleraas-type basis does not

reﬂects the logarithmic singularity of the true wave function at the origin as predicted by Bartlett

and Fock. Two important approaches are proposed in this work to reach this full matching: the

coordinate transformation method and the asymptotic series method. Besides these, this work

makes use of the least square method to substitute complicated numerical integrations in solving

the Schr¨odinger equation, without much loss of accuracy; this method is routinely used by people to

ﬁt a theoretical curve with discrete experimental data, but I use it here to simplify the computation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Most approximate methods to solve a linear partial diﬀerential equation, such as the stationary state

Schr¨odinger equation, are actually to choose an N -dimensional subspace of the inﬁnite-dimensional

Hilbert space and then to reduce the partial diﬀerential equation to N linear algebraic equations

deﬁned in this subspace. The eﬃciency of this kind of methods is mainly determined by whether one

∗E-mail: tansn@itp.ac.cn

can use suﬃcient small N to reach suﬃcient high accuracy, i.e., make the vector most close to the true

solution in this subspace suﬃciently close to the true solution while keeping the dimension N not too

large to handle.

Most methods to solve the Coulombic quantum three-body problem belong to this class, except for

some variational methods that make use of some non-linear variational parameters. The diﬀerences

between diﬀerent methods of this kind mainly lie in diﬀerent choices of the subspaces of the Hilbert

space, i.e., diﬀerent choices of the basis functions to expand the wave function.

Theoretically, any discrete and complete set of basis functions may be used to expand the wave

function, and the convergency is easy to fulﬁlled. But actually, the convergency is often slow and

makes suﬃcient accuracy diﬃcult to achieve. The naive hyperspherical harmonic function method[1-

3] in solving the Coulombic quantum three-body problem is such an example–this slow convergency

can be illustrated by an analogous and simple example: to expand the function f (x) = √1

x2
+1) as a series of the Legendre polynomials of x. This series is convergent like N −s, where

(
−
s is a positive constant not large and N is the number of Legendre polynomials involved. The reason

−

≤

≤

x

for this slow convergency is that f (x) is singular at x =

1 but the Legendre polynomials of x are not.

±

I call this the mismatching between the analytical structures of the basis functions (the polynomials

of x) and f (x).

The correlation function hyperspherical harmonic(CFHH) method[4] were proposed to overcome

this diﬃculty. The spirit of this method can be simply illustrated, still using the above example:

to divide f (x) by an appropriately selected function(called the correlation function) to cancel the

low order singularities of f (x) at x =
1, then to expand the remaining function by the Legendre
polynomials of x. This time, the series is still convergent as N −s, but s is increased by an amount

±

depending on how many orders’ singularities have been canceled.

From this simple discussion one can see that the singularities of the function f (x) are not completely

canceled by the correlation function, although more sophisticated correlation function can cancel more

orders’ singularities.

A very simple approach to totally eliminate the singularity is to make an appropriate coordinate

transformation, and in the same time thoroughly give up the original hyperspherical harmonic function

method, not just repair it. For example, for f (x) = √1

x2, one may write x = sin θ, where

−

θ

π/2

π/2, then f (x) = cos θ and one can expand f (x) as the series about the Legendre

−
polynomials of (2/π)θ. This time the series is factorially convergent. The reason is that the analytical

≤

≤

structures of f (x) and Pl((2/π)θ) match–they are both analytical functions on the whole complex

plane of θ.

Another useful approach to solve this problem is to use the asymptotic series. Still considering the

example f (x) = √1

x2, one may write the Taylor series

−

f (x) = f0 + f1x + f2x2 + f3x3 +

.

· · ·

Of course, this series is slowly convergent near x =

1. But one can use the following asymptotic

fn = ((

Now I introduce an alternative approach to reduce a diﬀerential equation to a given ﬁnite di-

mensional subspace

N of tbe Hilbert space. Here N is the dimension of the subspace. The central

L

problem is how to reduce an operator O in the Hilbert space, e.g., the kinetic energy operator or

the potential energy operator, to an N

N matrix in the given subspace. For a state Ψ

N , the

OΨ usually /

is to write the states as wavefunctions under a particular representation(e.g., the space-coordinate

where xa is some sample points in the deﬁning area of the wavefunctions. In order to ensure Ξ to be a

good approximation of ΨO, the sample points should be appropriately chosen. Usually the number of

the sample points is greater than and approximately proportional to N , and the separation between

two neighboring sample points should be less than the least quasi-semiwavelength of a wavefunction

This alternative approach (I call it the least square method) leads to a reduction of the operator

N satisfying (φi, φj)′ = δij. We ﬁnd that this approach

a[φ(xa)

P

L

is very similar to the usual one, except that a discrete sum over sample points takes the place of the

usual innerproduct integration. And there is a great degree of freedom in the selection of the sample

points. In fact, as soon as the sample points are selected according to the spirit mentioned above, the

accuracy of the solution of the diﬀerential equation usually will not decrease signiﬁcantly. The major

factor that determines the accuracy of the solution is the choice of the subspace

N , which has been

L

discussed to some extent in previous pages.

In this work, solving the simpliest quantum three-body problem, the three methods discussed

above are all used: the coordinate transformation method, the asymptotic series method, and the

least square method. A high precision is reached for the ground state energy of the ideal helium atom,

and the solution has also some merit in comparison with the Hyleraas-type variational solution[5,6].

In section 2 the Bartlett-Fock expansion[7,8,9] is studied, in order to reﬂect the analytical structure of

the wavefunction near the origin. In this study, the asymptotic series are used to represent the hyper-

angular dependence of the wavefunction. In section 3 the (u, w) coordinate system is used to study the

hyper-angular dependence of the wavefunction. This coordinate system cancels the singularity of the

hyper-angular functions totally. The relationship between this coordinate system and the Hyleraas-

type variational method is also discussed. The least square method is used to reduce the hyper-angular

parts of the kinetic energy operator and the potential energy operator to ﬁnite-dimensional matrices.

In section 4 the connection of the outer region solution and the inner region Bartlett-Fock expansion

is studied, using the least square method. In section 5 the numerical result is presented and compared

with those of other methods. Some explanations are made. In section 6 some discussions are presented

and some future developments are pointed out.

In a word, a relevant hyper-angular function is described by a ﬁnite set of parameters up to a

high precision. These parameters are some Taylor coeﬃcients and some asymptotic coeﬃcients. To

operate with some functions of this kind means to operate with the corresponding sets of parameters.

The relevant operations are: addition of two functions–adding the corresponding parameters of the

two sets; multiplying a function by a constant–multiplying each parameter in the set by the constant;

multiplying a function by v(α, β)(eq.(7))– an appropriate linear transformation of the set of parameters

of the multiplied function; solving an equation Lnf = g with g known and f unknown–solving a set of

linear equations about the parameters corresponding to f . Here, I write the relevant linear equations

step 5: solve the a + b = n Taylor coeﬃcients of ψn,k+1, from eq.(8n,k).

step 6: solve the a + b < n Taylor coeﬃcients of ψn,k+1, from eq.(8n,k+1), with a + b decreas-

ing(analogous to case 1) to 0.

The free parameters in solving eq.(8)(see step 8 of case 2) are ﬁnally determined by the boundary

arbitrary t, because it is always convergent. But actually, when t is large, the convergency is slow

and there is canceling of large numbers before this convergency is reached, both of which make the

Bartlett-Fock expansion impractical. So I only use this expansion when t is relatively small(see ref.[15]

for similarity): √t

In atual calculation, I chose Lf = 100, Ls = 20, Li = 6, nmax = 7.5 (the largest n value of the

terms in eq.(4) that are not neglected), and ρ0 = 0.4, and found that the numerical error for the
ρ0) wavefunction is no more than a few parts in 1010. I use

calculation of the inner region (√t

this method to test the accuracy of the calculation: set E in eq.(8) (note that p

approximate wavefunction ψapp thus obtained to calculate the value (Hψapp)/ψapp, where H is the

exact Hamiltonian operator, and I ﬁnd it to be almost equal to the initial value Einitial, with a relative

error no more than a few parts in 1010.

When t is larger, another approach is used:

3 THE HYPER-ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF THE WAVEFUNC-

TION

We have seen that the hyper-angular dependence of the wavefunction, described as a function of

(α, β) for each ﬁxed ρ

this corresponds to the case that the distance between two of the three particles equals zero.

If the energy-eigenstate ψ is symmetric under the exchange of r1 and r2(spin-singlet), I believe that,

for each ﬁxed ρ, ψ is a entire function of (u, w). If the energy-eigenstate ψ is antisymmetric under the
interchange of r1 and r2(spin-triplet), I believe that, for each ﬁxed ρ, ψ = r1−r2

ρ φ, where φ is a entire

function of (u, w).

This beautiful characteristic makes it especially appropriate to approximate ψ, for each ﬁxed ρ,

by an n-order polynomial of (u, w), not by an n-order polynomial of (α, β). The former expansion,

a polynomial of (u, w), matches the analytical structure of ψ; while the latter one, a polynomial of

(α, β), does not. The hyper-spherical harmonic function method belongs to the latter expansion, a

polynomial of (α, β). So the hyper-spherical harmonic function expansion does not correctly reﬂect the

analytical structure of ψ. The slow convergency of the hyper-spherical harmonic function expansion

is only a consequence of this analytical structure mismatching.

We expect that the (u, w) polynomial expansion converges factorially to the true wavefunction. It

is worthful to demonstrate a similar example to illustrate this. Consider a function f (x) = exp(

x),

section 1.

4 CONNECTION OF THE INNER SIDE AND THE OUTER SIDE

In the area ρ < ρ0(inner region), the Bartlett-Fock expansion is used. In the area ρ > ρ0/2(outer

region), ψ is approximated by a vector in

N for each given ρ, and the partial derivatives with

L

respect to ρ are substituted by optimized variable-order and variable-step diﬀerences, which requires

the selection of a discrete set of ρ values. The overlap region of the inner region and the outer region

ensures the natural connection of the derivative of ψ, as well as the connection of ψ itself. The

connection is performed by using the least square method:

for a polynomial of (u, w) at ρ = ρ0,

appropriately choose the values of the free parameters of the solution of eq.(8) (see section 2) so

that the sum of the squares of the diﬀerences of the the inner region solution and the outer region

polynomial at the sample points is minimized. This deﬁnes a linear transformation to calculate the

values of those free parameters from the given polynomial. When the values of these free parameters

are determined, one can calculate the values of ψ in the region ρ0/2 < ρ < ρ0, using the Bartlett-Fock

solution, and further use these ψ values to construct polynomials of(u, w) at ρ0/2 < ρ < ρ0 (according

to the law of least square), and then use these polynomials in the diﬀerence calculation of the partial

derivative of ψ with respect to ρ at ρ

ρ0. At a suﬃcient large value ρ = ρ1, the ﬁrst-class boundary

≥

condition is exerted; of course, future development may substitute this by a connection with the long

range asymptotic solution of ψ.

At last, the whole Schr¨odinger equation is reduced to an eigen-problem of a ﬁnite-dimensional

matrix. The dimension of the matrix is Nρ ×
discretizing the partial derivatives with respect to ρ, and N is the number of independent hyper-

N , where Nρ is the number of free ρ nodes used in

angular polynomials used. Note that the energy value should be used in solving eq.(8), but it is

unknown. The actual calculation is thus an iteration process: choose an initial value of E0 to solve
eq.(8) and form the Nρ ×
new value E1, etc.. The ﬁnal result is the ﬁxed point of this iteration process. In actual calculation,

I found that the convergency of this iteration process is very rapid if ρ0 is relatively small. Choosing

ρ0 = 0.4, I found that each step of iteration cause the diﬀerence between the eigenvalue of the matrix

and the ﬁxed point decrease by about (

160) times, when calculating the ground state.

(the ﬁrst three points are for the natural connection of the derivative of ψ, the last point is for the

ﬁrst-class boundary condition, and the remained 40 points are free nodes), and discretizing the partial

derivatives with respect to ρ according to the complex-plane-division rule(that is: when calculating

the partial derivatives with respect to ρ at ρ = l, use and only use those node points satisfying ρ > l/2

in the diﬀerence format, because the point ρ = 0 is the singular point), I obtained the result for the

ground state energy of the ideal helium atom:

So the relative error of the result (19) is about 1.1

10−9. Since my method is not a variational method,

the error of the approximate wavefunction that I obtained should be of a similar order of magnitude,

(19)

(20)

so if one calculate the expectation value of the Hamiltonian under this approximate wavefunction, the

accuracy of the energy will be further raised by several orders of magnitude.

The result (19) is much more accurate than the result of ref.[10]:

2.90359, which used the hyper-

−

spherical coordinate method. In ref.[10], the quantum numbers (l1, l2) (angular momenta of the two

electrons) are used and a cutoﬀ for them is made; this cutoﬀ does not correctly reﬂect the analytical

structure of ψ at r12 = 0 (equivalently β = 1). This is the major reason causing the inaccuracy of the

result of ref.[10].

It is also worthful to compare my result with that of ref.[4], in which the correlation function

hyper-spherical harmonic method is used. Note that the result (19) is obtained by using a set of

N=64, the result is

N = 66 hyper-radius-dependent coeﬃcients to expand the wavefunction. For a similar size in ref.[4],
10−9. When N=169, the result
10−9. Apparently my method converges

more rapidly than that of ref.[4]. The major reason is that the correlation function hyper-spherical

harmonic method does not cancel the singularities totally—there is still some discontinuity for the

higher order derivatives, although the low order singularities, which trouble the naive hyperspherical

harmonic method, are canceled by the correlation function.

6 CONCLUSIONS, DISCUSSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

In conclusion, there are several important ideas in my work that should be emphasized: ﬁrst, I use

the asymptotic series to compute the Bartlett-Fock series up to a high precision, with error no more

than, for example, a few parts in 1010. Second, I propose an alternative coordinate system, the (u, w)

system, in which the hyper-angular singularities are thoroughly eliminated, which renders a factorial

convergency for the expansion of the hyper-angular function. Third, I make use of the least square

method to reduce an operator(inﬁnite dimensional matrix) to a ﬁnite dimensional matrix in a ﬁnite

dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space and to connect the solutions in diﬀerent regions, avoiding

complicated numerical integrations, without much loss of the accuracy for the solution. Fourth,

the optimized diﬀerence format —the complex plane division rule—is used to discretize the partial

derivatives of the wavefunction with respect to ρ. I calculated the ground state energy of an ideal

helium atom concretely and obtained a very high precision, demonstrating that my method is superior

to many other methods and competitive with any sophisticated methods.

About the analytical structure of the stationary wavefunction: 1. there are logarithmic singularities

at ρ = 0, in the forms of ρm(ln ρ)k; 2.

for a given ρ, ψ (for a spin-singlet) or ψ/[(r1 −

r2)/ρ](for a

spin-triplet) has no singularity, as a function of (u, w).

Here, I must mention the well known variational method based on the Hyleraas-type functions,

because it also satisﬁes the second characteristic of the wavefunction mentioned in the above paragraph.

r2)2 in this function by 2ρ2

One can see this by a simple derivation. The Hyleraas-type function is a entire function of r1, r2 and
r12, or equivalently, a entire function of r1 + r2, r1 −
(r1 −
of r1 + r2 and r12 for spin-singlet, or such kind of entire function times a common factor r1 −
spin-triplet. Equivalently, for ﬁxed ρ, the Hyleraas-type function is a entire function of (u, w)(spin-
singlet) or such kind of entire function times r1−r2

r2, and r12. For a ﬁxed ρ, one can substitute
(r1 + r2)2, so that, for ﬁxed ρ, the function is a entire function

(spin-triplet). This characteristic is one of the most

r2 for

ρ

important reasons that account for the high accuracy of the Hyleraas-type variational method.

But this variational method also has its shortcoming: the Hyleraas-type function does not reﬂect

the logarithmic singularities with respect to ρ. So, although this method has high precision for the

energy levels, the approximate wavefunctions that it renders may deviate signiﬁcantly from the true

wavefunctions near the origin. See ref.[4,13,14] for detailed discussions.

A central idea of this paper is: devising the calculation method according to the analytical structure

of the true solution. The (u, w) coordinates, the Bartlett-Fock expansion and the asymptotic series

approach to compute this expansion, and the complex-plane-division rule in calculating the partial

derivatives with respect to ρ, all reﬂect this central idea. The basic principle that ensures high

numerical precision is just this idea.

This preliminary work is incomplete in the following aspects:
First, how to prove that ψ(for spin-singlet, or ψ/[(r1 −

r2)/ρ] for spin-triplet) has no singularity for

ﬁxed ρ, as a function of (u, w)? Note that if this function still has singularities outside of the physical

area

(see previous ﬁgure), the convergency of the expansion of the hyper-angular function will be

D

only exponential, not factorial. Of course, even if such kind of singularities do exist, my method will

still converge more rapidly than the correlation function hyperspherical harmonic method, because
the latter method only converges like N −p, slower than exp(

γ√N ). The rapid convergency of my

−

method make me guess that such kind of singularities do not exist.

Second, the asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction, when one electron is far away from the

nucleus, is not studied in this work. This problem will be important when the highly excited states

and the scattering states are studied, a topic that will become my next object.

Third, how to use the ideas proposed in this work to study a helium atom with ﬁnite nuclear mass?

Besides this, the relativistic and QED corrections must be calculated, if one want to obtain a result

comparable with high-precision experiments.

Fourth, I have focused on the S states till now. When the total angular momentum is not zero,

there might be more than one distance-dependent functions (see, for example, ref.[11]).

I believe

that some important analytical structures of the S states studied in this work are also valid for those

functions.

Surely, some important aspects of this work will also play an important role in the highly excited

states and the scattering states: the logarithmic singularities about ρ and the method to compute the

Bartlett-Fock expansion, the non-singularity with respect to the coordinates (u, w), and the technique

to connect solutions of diﬀerent regions, etc.. They can be applied to the study of the highly excited

states and the scattering states.

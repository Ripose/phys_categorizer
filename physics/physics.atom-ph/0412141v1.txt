Abstract

Revivals of optical coherence of molecular photoassociation driven by two
ultrashort laser pulses are addressed in the Condon approach. Based on textbook
examples and numerical simulation of KrF excimer molecules, a prediction is
made about an existence of photon echo on free-bound transitions. Delayed rise
and fall of nonlinear polarization in the half-collisions are to be resulted from the
resonant quantum states interference whether it be in gas, liquid or solid phases.

Introduction

At present, the photoassociation spectroscopy (PAS) of atoms colliding along
the ground state potential and interacting with photons to produce molecular
dimers (through the inverse predissociation) has attracted a great deal of at-
tentions 1−7. This technique, as applied in conventional continuous wave5,16
(CW) and fentosecond1 regimes, permits a determination of the rovibrational
leveles, hyperﬁne structure, scattering lengths and/or dynamics of bond forma-
tion that can be derived with an unprecedented accuracy. To assess the primary
processes of harpooning reactions2, photoassociative and the Penning ioniza-
tions 3, relaxation of the van der Waals complexes4 in liquids and quantum
gases in optical traps, the PAS is ideally suited. The review of earlier devel-

opments, which have been collected under the rubric of chemical reactions in
transition spectroscopy, can be found in 6. The most recent innovation to the
CW PAS is investigation of Bose’s state of the cold atoms7 in which a loss of
coherence can be controlled trough the laser assisted binary collisions.

One would naively claim that the femtosecond PAS is not quite sensitive
as the resonant CW schemes, since only a low number of atoms distributed
randomly in close proximity during ultrashort pulses may contribute to the co-
herent bonding. However, the shorter impulse, the wider its spectrum, the more
the free-bound transitions involved. An example is found in photoinduced har-
pooning reactions 8 in which according to the M. Polanyi the attacking open
shell atom tosses out its valence electron, then hooks the closed shell atom and
hauls it in with the Coulomb force even at a range of hundreds Angstroms1.
This reaction endowed with separation of degrees of freedom into nuclear and
electronic coordinates controlled by the femtosecond optical pulses may have
a high quantum yield.

It is straightforward to extend the femtosecond PAS to address the four wave
mixing geometry or its two or three wave realizations. This makes it possible
to investigate the nonlinear optical effects those are no longer observable in the
weak ﬁelds. Such as a photon echo photoassociation which is counterpart of
the photon echo of photodissociation. A theoretical description of the latter is
only being reported by us 9,10 in context of the wave packet engineering. It
is evident now, that a well matched spreading and squeezing of the vibrational
wave packets are called for the desired optical properties of molecular samples.
So that the quantum control in the weak ﬁeld regime requires a complicated
pulse shaping 11. While "spontaneous" coherence, i.e., a photon echo, is ob-
tained trough a more strong, short and transform limited (non chirped) ﬁelds
that enables one to automate the wave packet preparation on the free-bound
transitions.

The transients having the entanglement of discrete levels and continuum
usually result in a decay 12. The quantum transition amplitudes may decrease
depending on the contribution of the molecular repulsion or quantum disper-
sion. In the frequency domain, the resonant coupling is accompanied by the
inhomogeneous broadening (dephasing) of the Franck-Condon transitions. If
the latter dominates over an irreversible relaxation in multi-channel (chemical)
collisions, spontaneous emission, the photon echo can be harvested as for the
bound-bound transitions 13.

To make this point a bit clear, we follow the next plan. In Sec.2 the Condon
model of femtosecond PAS is analyzed. We relate the delayed transients to the
wave packet interference residing in molecular continuum after the second im-

pulse. Analytical expressions are derived for the χ(3) polarization induced by
2 δ-like impulses. A singularity of χ(3) is identiﬁed with an inﬁnite region of
the Franck-Condon transitions simultaneously involved. For the realistic ﬁeld
shapes this trait is eliminated. The PAS is particular appealing for the investi-
gating excitations of the rare gas halides, for which the electronic ground states
are dissociating. This system is of use as an active media of the high-power
lasers2 and photon echo of photoassociation might deliver a valuable informa-
tion on timescales of excited molecular states in the lasing. Speciﬁcally, the
relevant model of molecular dynamics of the krypton ﬂuoride KrF(B) excimer
is simulated in Sec.3, where we consider a photoinduced harpooning reaction
of interacting Kr cations and F anions created at thermal conditions. To avoid
the Condon reﬂection principle, which overestimates contribution of turning
points and disregards oscillatory tails of the wave functions, the B-X transition
(at 248 nm) is treated in the globally uniform approach. The Wigner represen-
tation gives an insight into why the photon echoes of photoassociation exist
from the kinematical point of view. Section 4 concludes.

Condon Model

Strictly speaking, ’ab-initio’ approach to PAS necessitates a many-body
ﬁeld theory of interacting matter-light species. However, any more rigorous
treatment of the photoassisted reactions beyond the Born-Oppengheimer strat-
egy faces sophisticated mathematical problems of exclusion of extra degrees
of freedoms and transitions between multidimensional surfaces. It is not sur-
prising, then, that a generic model with simpliﬁed potential curves, in which
the bound-free transitions occur in one-body treatment, has been introduced at
the drawn of the age of quantum mechanics 14. Herein, a separation of degrees
of freedom gives the paradigm of application of the Franck-Condon principle
asserting that for a time of electron transfer, the coordinates and momenta of
nuclei do not vary because of the large difference between the electronic and
nuclear masses. Molecular dynamics is governed by the Hamiltonian opera-
tors:

ˆHb = ˆTkin + ˆVb;

ˆHf = ˆTkin + ˆVf ,

where ˆTkin is the operator of kinetic energy of relative motion in the motionless
center mass of a molecule and the Doppler’s shift of frequency is disregarded
as marginal.
Initially, atoms collide along the ground electronic term with
constant interatomic interaction ˆVf = 0. The excited electronic curve can be
presented by the potential ˆVb = ω0+Ω2x2/2 with understanding that the actual
curves are deﬂected of the parabolic well at longer and shorter distances from

its equilibrium position. The model potential has merit of being exactly solved
best serving for our methodological purpose. We have chosen the test example
of oscillatory motion with frequency Ω as a vehicle with which to demonstrate
general aspects of photoassociation. Without restricting the generality, an ef-
fective mass of molecule equals unit. The electronic states are coupled by the
electric dipole interaction ˆVbf = ˆµE(t), where the laser impulses have the
slow envelops E(t) and fast optical frequency ω0. The envelope differs from
zero only for the moments of photon impacts.

In order to have general formalism capable of dealing with both bound and
scattering states, we employ the momentum representation. A crucial assump-
tion is made that our system has a very large box volume V . The energy spec-
trum of atoms forming the plane waves is bound to be quasi-continuous in the
box. It is required of the initial quantum conditions
f (p) that
the box wave functions possess the property of random phases. This require-
ment corresponds to the "molecular chaos" with the canonical Gibs thermal

Let us consider an idealization of the δ- like impulses. The Franck-Condon
principle ensures the intact positions and momenta of the wave packets on the
resonant electronic terms during the laser ﬁeld action. The optical polariza-
tion of the system is found by calculating the dipole moment µ in the Condon
approximation in which a total span of Franck-Condon region of free-bound
transition includes the (inﬁnite) box V, whilst the relative electronic transition

The kernel K (1) is determined by a "hyperbolic" rotation on complex angle
W (t) given by:

cos(Wdecay(t)) = cos(Ωt) + 0.5Ω(iβ + t)sin(Ωt),

The hyperbolic rotation is inspired by the dynamical symmetry group SU (1, 1)
responsible for the phase and amplitude modulation of average dipole mo-
ment. In frequency domain, the hyperbolic rotation gives rise in inhomoge-
neous broadening of spectral lines of free-bound transitions 15.

The free-bound transition amplitude K (1)(t) has a time-integrable singular-
ity of the order 1/√t. Notice that this kernel is resulted from an unbounded
spectrum of the simultaneously driven resonant transitions induced by the δ-
pulse. This artifact of the polarization singularity can be corrected whether
by a dipole moment cutoff that leads us beyond the Condon approximation

and/or frequency limited spectrum of the excitation ﬁeld. However, being the
µ cutoff length dependent, it becomes tedious for the analytical analysis. The
thermalization and internal molecular interference add to the complexity of the
problem. This is the case of femtosecond PAS. The nonlinear optical polar-
ization depends also on the multi-dimensional convolutions of the actual ﬁeld
envelopes with the singular kernels induced by the δ ﬁelds. Their nonlinear
combinations provide another vectors of directional coherence along which
the echo signals are to be observed. We shall set these problems aside for
sake of simplicity to treat molecular photoassociation in the δ-pulse limit and
focusing on collinear geometry of incident electromagnetic wave vectors. Sug-
gesting that these two δ-pulses operate having the inter-pulse delay T , we ﬁnd

For the weak ﬁeld regime the resonant coupling of continuum and bound
wave functions in the Franck-Condon region is determined by the time de-
pendent Fermi golden rule as shown in Fig. 1. A monotonic decay of the
Franck-Condon factors will no longer be valid at a low temperature, e.g. at
inverse temperature β = 1/Ω corresponding to one vibrational quantum. The
reason has to do with the quantum dispersion which alone cannot destroy co-
herence. Molecular repulsion for inclined potential curves or predissociation
would afford exponential decay 12. But even in this instance, a net construc-
tive or destructive interference of two wave packets prepared by the pump and
delayed impulses occurring at or near multiples of the vibrational period might
result in the revivals of coherence. The transition amplitude spikes reﬂect the
return of the vibrational wave packet on the attractive potential curve.

To consider the echo effect in the weak ﬁeld regime we derived the µ(3)-
polarization from Eqs.(11-13). In the Condon model, the transition amplitudes
between the propagating states are obtained explicitly as a function of time
and an average polarization is plotted in inset in Fig.1. The echo signal itself
consists of a number of short peaks most prominent when a delay T is close to
multiple of the vibrational period (T
Tvib = 2π/Ω). The Eq.(13) determines

where v0 ∝
relation time τcor = r0/T v0 = β/ΩT, which matches Eq.(14) for HWHM and
has to play a key role in determining the nonlinear polarization peaks. What
this means is the validity of kinematical argumentation based on the quasiclas-
sical transport theory allowing us to justify the echo of photoassociation just
as the photon echo of molecular photodissociation10 . It is appropriate to re-
call that in the latter, the ground molecular wave function forms a wave packet
of the receding atoms following ﬁrst impulse. Atomic distribution acquires a
stretched elliptic shape in the phase space formed by the coordinates and ve-
locities. The ellipse is strongly squeezed in the transversal direction by virtue
of "free" propagation. However, the total phase space volume (according to
the Liouville theorem) persists. Being driven back by the second impulse, the
wave packet replica settles in the binding term as a non stationary state.

For the harmonic model, the ellipse rotates as a hole at the vibrational fre-
quency. In addition, the replica of the initial state, which was preserved after
the ﬁrst impulse, repeats the evolution of the wave packet in the molecular con-
2 strongly depends on the interference
tinuum. The transition amplitude

τecho = τdecay/((ΩT )2 + 1),
where τdecay is the time of free radiation decay depending on molecular curves
and temperature.
It equals a molecular radius a divided by typical velocity
of receding atoms in the phase space. The longer the inter-pulse delay T , the
larger the squeezing of molecular states, the larger the correlation radius of
receding atoms, and the faster decay of the Franck-Condon overlapping. This
implies, that the wave packet moving on the smaller ellipse diameter a varying
as 1/ΩT has to move it with velocity v which grows directly ΩT (proportional
to the correlation radius). The overlap time is given by the ratio a/v to yield
the mentioned trend τecho ∝
The same reason holds true for the photon echo of photoassociation. But its
duration features its inverse power of T . This is because only a propagating
state in the continuum is being squeezed after the second impulse as a function

(ΩT )−2.

of inter-pulse delay. The difference between the echo scaling laws for the pho-
todissociation and photoassociation is founded on the fact, that, in the former,
both wave packets evolved on the binding term and in the continuum X-states
are squeezed. Also the µ(3)- polarization has a maximum peak near t = 2T .
Our analysis indicates that the HWHM increasingly decreases with the temper-
ature. Besides, at the delay time exactly matching the oscillatory period 2π/Ω,
the amplitude of spontaneous revivals may appear to diverge at points t = 2T .
Fortunately, this divergence rules out in the µ(3) polarization controlled by the
realistic laser ﬁeld which shape differs from the δ-like envelopes.

The theory of this phenomenon is best clariﬁed in the phase space of the
system. The free-bound transitions are characterized by the distribution of the
collisional pairs over their electronic excitations, internuclear separations and
velocities. Therefore an uniform representation for the scattering states, those
are quasiclassical in their nature, may be helpful. Just as for the photodis-
sociation picture, the molecular dynamics can be visualized for the Wigner
distribution functions. For the thermal atoms, the Wigner map has the shape
of inﬁnite strip along the coordinate axis. The strip width in the transversal
direction is equal to the thermal de-Broglie wavelength.

The ﬁrst impulse conveys the collisional pair to the binding electronic B-
term. The replica of the thermal Wigner distribution sets here. After that, the
atoms oscillate between the turning points. This corresponds to the strip dis-
tribution in phase space which rotates at the harmonic frequency. The second
impulse does the same with the remaining portion of colliding atoms. In ad-
dition, it simultaneously promotes the rotated strip to the continuum, where
the latter starts to spread along the coordinate axis. The spreading distribution
squeezes in transversal direction. It is apparent, that their overlap sharply rises
and falls, when the adjacent Wigner maps cross each other. If the maps turn out
parallel, a total span of the induced free-bound transitions includes an inﬁnite
volume of our simplistic model enabling the Franck-Condon factor to diverge.

the Wigner representation to calculate the matrix density overlap of Kr(4p6S0)-
F(2p5 2P) photoassisted collisions along X- and B-molecular terms shown in
Fig.2. Applying the classical dynamic routines to colliding Kr and F atoms,
we directly obtain the Wigner density functions of photoassociation. The δ-
like envelopes of laser ﬁelds allow us to deal just with the propagating states
density. In Fig. 3 we display the contour maps calculated from the transport
equation Eq. (17). The thermal atoms occupy the half-strip terminating in a
short distance due to the strong exchange repulsion on the covalent X-term.

The energy gap between the ground covalent state and bottom of the ionic B-

The Wigner maps in the upper row in Fig. 3 present the evolution of the thermal
distribution of the X-states distorted by the ﬁrst δ-pulse that resonantly drives
them to ionic B-states. Then, the F anions and Kr cations are attracted together
due to the joint action of the Coulomb force and induced ion-quadrupole in-
teractions. In the harpooning reaction, the Wigner map of the thermal atoms
curves forming a hook and then a spiral structure in the phase space. The spi-
ral step is conditioned by the potential anharmonicity. For the pure harmonic
model, a rotation of the initial strip as a hole at the oscillatory frequency takes
place. The Wigner maps of the propagating X,B-states created by the pulse
pair are shown in Fig. 4. We take the inter-pulse delay equal to about a period
( 90 fs) of molecular vibration in the bottom of B-state. The second impulse
transports the Wigner’s B-state distribution partially back to continuum, as it
is, conserving its spiral shape. The spiral branches are spreading on the co-
valent X-curve and simultaneously squeezing in the momentum direction. In

addition, its optical ﬁeld might induce a harpooning reaction by producing a
collisional pair of cation Kr and anion F. The Wigner distribution on their B-
binding term repeats the evolution following the ﬁrst impulse. In Fig. 5 we

tion of time. The overlap of the Wigner’s distributions of the X and B -states
quickly tends to zero. The decay time after the ﬁrst impulse can be evaluated
as a width at the half maximum height of the integral Eq.(17). This time is
about 20 f s long that conforms the estimate based on the classical mechanics.
Doing so, consider a particle moving with a thermal velocity in the covalent
X-state.
Its wave packet is transported to the binding B-term via a vertical
Franck-Condon’s transitions. Then, it needs the time:

τdecay ≈ Z

to destroy an alignment of the Wigner’s distributions while the wave packet
travels between the turning points in the quantum well. The turning points
2.65A are determined by the thermal energy

Figure 5.
The free radiation decay and photon echo of molecular photoassociation of KrF.
The HWHM of µ(1) polarization is about 20 fs. The relevant µ(3) polarization created by two
δ-like laser ﬁelds having normalized pulse areas θ1,2 = 1 and inter-pulse delay 90 fs is shown
in inset.

Ether = 100 [cm−1] of collision pairs of Kr and F atoms. The wave packet
loses its momentum correlation with nascent replica of X state for time its
journey between the turning points. Our ﬁrst rough estimate of about 40
fs is obtained by substituting to Eq.(19) the velocity: vb(R) = (2(Ether −
Vb(R))/M )1/2, and by taking the numerical values of the reduced mass M
≈
15.5 of the KrF molecule. Inset also shows the rise and fall of the overlaps
of the Wigner’s distributions after the second ultrashort pulse. This occurs at
twice time-delay, when the hook map crosses the spiral branches of the X-state
distribution. Our numerical calculation indicates, that the photon echo signal is
rather robust with respect to a small deviations of the inter-pulse delay from the
gating conditions T = Tvib. This robustness can be attributed to anharmonicity
of the KrF(B) potential.

Conclussions

We have demonstrated how the ultrashort pulses can reverse the natural
tendency of the nonlinear optical transients to decay in photoassisted half-
collisions. The photon echo of molecular photoassociation presents a paradigm
of the coherent self-organization in optics. This occurs in the continuum states
initially residing in the Gibbs equilibrium ensemble. The photoassosiation is

14

followed by the delayed photodissociation giving rise the correlation radius of
propagating states to grow proportionally as the inter-pulse time-delay. The
latter results in a long lived transient complex. Then, the echo signals man-
ifests on the free-bound transitions following the free radiation decay that is
dictated by the resonant coupling probability in accordance with the time de-
pendent Fermi golden rule. This delayed coherence is accounted for by the
inverse predissociation amounting to phenomena conceptually identical with
the interference stabilization of atoms (molecules) in the strong ionizing (dis-
sociating) laser ﬁelds.

The femtosecond coherence of the laser assisted collisions is formed on
the molecular nano-scales and can be observed in optically thin samples. This
effect might provide a way to make a compact light compressor without limita-
tions imposed by the self-modulation effects in the optical wave-guides. From
the spectroscopic point of view, the photon echo of photoassociation provides
for unique data on the ﬂy during the binary half-collisions. The echo spikes
splitting can exhibit an inhomogeneous broadening inherent to the distribu-
tion of guest atoms in host solid with the sub-wavelength resolution up to
Angstrom’s scale. This opens up a possibility to trace the migration of open-
shell atoms in rare gas matrices and cage exit. Kindred phenomena might be
studied by molecular dynamics simulations 17 to provide a new avenue for the
echo spectroscopy in solids and liquids.

In brief, therein our major aim was not a quantitative agreement with an
experiment, but to broadly predict the general aspects of the photon echo of
photoassociation and to delineate those its features which depend on inter-
pulse delay of laser pumping, molecular potentials and temperature of sample.
The echo scheme has a merit to automate the wave packet preparation mak-
ing it a quite favorable for a practical design, where the pulse shaping is not
necessary. It is important to stress a geometrical aspect of the effect, in which
2~k2 of the echo coherence is distinguished from the
the directional vector ~k1 −
incident wave vectors ~k1 and ~k2 of the pump and delayed ﬁelds. This offers a
convenient experimental condition for observing spontaneous photons on dark
background with angular and temporal lag from the laser ﬁring. The details of
the signal may be varied from one molecular system to another, but the broad
conclusion is quite robust.

Abstract

In this work we present an improvement over the Over Barrier Model (OBM)

described in a recent paper [F. Sattin, Phys. Rev. A 62, 042711 (2000)]. We

show that: i) one of the two free parameters there introduced actually comes

out consistently from the starting assumptions underlying the model; ii) the

modiﬁed model thus obtained is as much accurate as the former one. Further-

more, we show that OBMs are able to accurately predict some recent results

of state selective electron capture, at odds with what previously supposed.

The electron capture process in collisions of slow ions with neutral atoms

or other ions is of great importance in basic atomic physics, plasma physics

and astrophysics. In principle, one could compute all the quantities of inter-

est in such processes by writing the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for

the system and programming a computer to solve it. This task can be per-

formed on present–days supercomputers for moderately complicated systems.

Notwithstanding this, simple approximate models are still valuable: (i) they

allow getting analytical estimates, which are easy to adapt to particular cases;

(ii) allow getting physical insight on the features of the problem by looking at

the analytical formulas; (iii) ﬁnally, they can be the only tools available when

the complexity of the problem overcomes the capabilities of the computers.

For this reason new models are being still developed [1–3].

The present author has presented in a recent paper [4] a study attempting to

improve an already existing OBM [2] (this model will be hereafter referred to

as I). The model there developed is able to predict cross sections for electron

capture and ionization with appreciable accuracy for a large number of test

cases. The key element was found to be the inclusion within the model of

two free parameters, there labeled α and fT . A large part of the paper [4]

was devoted to show that, more than simple adjustable parameters, α and fT

stand for some physical mechanism still not adequately included within the

model. As such, one should expect they retain constant values from case to

case, or vary according to some well deﬁned relationship with the parameters

of the problem at hand. Actually, it was found, by applying the model to a

number of test cases, that a good agreement with experiment and/or other

computations was obtained always with the same choice for both parameters

(in detail, α = 1, fT = 2).

In this paper we show that a correction to the capture probability, having the

same meaning of parameter fT , should appear naturally within the frame-

2

work of the model I; that in the work [4] it was incorrectly overlooked and,

as a consequence, we were forced to insert fT by hand in order of recovering

accuracy of the results.

Let us begin with a brief summary of model I; the reader is referred to [4]

for a more complete discussion. We consider a standard scattering experiment

between a target nucleus T and a projectile nucleus P with only one active

electron e. We are considering hydrogenlike approximations for both the

target and the projectile. Let r be the electron vector relative to T and R

the distance between T and P. In the spirit of classical OBMs, all particles

are considered as classical objects.

Let us consider the plane

containing all the three particles and use the

P

projection of cylindrical polar coordinates (ρ, z, φ

0) to describe the position

≡

of the electron within this plane. We can assign the z axis to the direction

The total energy of the electron is (atomic units will be used unless otherwise

along the internuclear axis.

Z and Zt are the eﬀective charge of the projectile and of the target, respec-

tively. From here on, we assign an eﬀective charge Zt = 1 to the target and

an eﬀective quantum number n to label the binding energy of the electron:

1/(2n2).

En ≡
When the projectile approaches the target nucleus, it also contribute to in-

crease (in absolute value) the binding energy of the electron:

This represents the limit of the region classically allowed to the electron.

When R

this region is divided into two disconnected circles centered on

→ ∞

each of the two nuclei. Initial conditions determine which of the two regions

actually the electron lives in. As R diminishes there can be eventually an

instant where the two regions become connected. See ﬁg. (1) of [4] for an

example of this.

In the spirit of OBMs it is the opening of the equipotential curve between P

and T which leads to a leakage of electrons from one nucleus to another, and

therefore to charge exchange. It is easy to solve eq. (3) for R by imposing a

vanishing width of the opening:

Rm =

En

In the region of the opening the potential U has a saddle structure. Charge

loss occurs provided the electron is able to cross this potential barrier. Let

NΩ be the fraction of trajectories which lead to electron loss at the time t.

An approximate expression (valid for distant collisions) for NΩ is given in [2].

We simply quote that result:

In this expression dt/T is the fraction of electrons which cross any surface

perpendicular to their motion (and enter the loss region) within time interval

dt, with T = 2πn3 the unperturbed period of the electron motion along its

orbit, and fT a corrective term which accounts for the perturbation.

In order to actually integrate Eq. (6) we need to know the collision trajectory;

for this an unperturbed straight line with b impact parameter is assumed:

The extrema

tm in the integral (6) are the maximum values of t at which

±

charge loss can occur. They are related through Eq. (7) to the maximum

distance at which capture may occur, Rm (Eq. 4). This is the original estimate

for Rm as given in [2].

In [4] this estimate was questioned on the basis of

the fact that it overestimated the maximum impact parameter available for

charge exchange as computed by Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC)

calculations. As a consequence, the cross sections were overestimated, too.

To remedy this, in [4] it was suggested to replace Eq. (4) with

R

m =

(α√Z + 1)
En

.

With the choice α = 2 we recover Eq.

(4), but it was found that better

agreement with data was obtained for α = 1. The value α = 1 can be given

also a physical meaning: it is easy to show (see for details ref. [4]) that, when

substituted into Eq. (8), it yields the maximum distance at which an electron

can be captured provided that, prior to the capture, the electron trajectory

is not perturbed in any way by the projectile, i.e.

the electron follows a

trajectory with constant energy E =

En, instead of E given by eq. (2).

The key point we want to underline here is that the deﬁnition of the orbital

One recovers T = 2πn3 by putting E

be consistent with Eq.

(2) one should assume that the orbital period of

the electron is changed, just like its binding energy, while the projectile is

approaching. The expression Eq. (2) should thus be used in (11). By doing

so, one gets

The orbital period is now a varying quantity function of time, and it is always

T ′ < T . The exact value of the enhancement factor T /T ′ depends upon R.

In [4] this enhancement factor was held constant, being the parameter fT ,

usually taken equal to 2.

In order to have a quantitative estimate let us

remark that captures occur preferentially for R of order of R′

m (see e.g. ﬁg. 5

of ref. [4]). We replace therefore R with R′

m in the previous equation and get

that T /T ′ reaches its minimum value T /T ′ = (3/2)3/2

1.84 for Z = 1 (with

≈

α = 1). The ratio increases rather slowly with Z: asimptotically it follows the

scaling T /T ′

Z 3/4, Z

; however, it is already T /T ′ > 2 for all integer

≈

→ ∞

values Z > 1. Therefore, we expect to have enhanced cross sections with

respect to model I when dealing with highly charged projectile ions, while

they should be-very slightly-depressed in collisions with singly charged ions.

This is a conﬁrmation of the guess done in [4], according to which fT was

likely to be an increasing function of Z.

Unfortunately, the integral in (13) can no longer be computed analytically;

however, σ is still easily numerically computed with only a few lines of code

written in any mathematical software package.

We want now to test the model: as a ﬁrst test case we address the process

H + Be4+

H+ + Be3+ .

→

It has been studied by two diﬀerent approaches in [6,7], so we can rate pre-

dictions of Eqns. (6,13) against some sophisticated theories. The results are

plotted in ﬁg. (1). The agreement between the old and the new model is

rather good, with the latter slightly overestimating the former, as expected.

As a second test case we present the results for collisions H+– Na(3s,3p)

(ﬁg. 2). Here the projectile is singly charged, so Eq. (13) is expected to give

a result lower than Eq. (6), and this is exactly found. In this case, as already

remarked in [4], the performance of the model is rather bad. We can just

state again that the reason could be found in the non-hydrogen-like nature of

the target. An upgrade of the model taking into account more realistic model

potentials binding the electron could give remarkable enhancements.

We want now to address a rather diﬀerent point. It is partially unrelated

with previous topics since it does not deal with any kind of improvement to

the model. Instead, we will show that the OBM (any version of it, be the

original version by Ostrovsky, the version I or the present one) is able to

predict some experimental results previously thought not amenable to this

kind of analysis. The experiments we are referring to, on charge exchange

between slow ions and Rydberg atoms, are reported in the paper [9]. Among

other quantities, it was measured the binding energy of the captured electron

7

Ep as a function of the impact velocity v, of the projectile charge Zp and–

above all–of the binding energy of the Rydberg target Et, which allowed to

compute the normalized energy defect function 1

k = (Ep −

−

Et)/Ep. This

is a convenient quantity since it can be computed for a number of models,

including the CTMC method and OBMs. Within the OBM the computation

goes as follows: the initial energy of the electron is E =

Z/R whereas

Et −

−

in the ﬁnal state it is E =

1/R. When the electron is being transferred

from one nucleus to the other the two quantities must be equal, thus

The maximal contribution to charge exchange is given by R close to the

maximum allowed R′

m (see e.g. ﬁg. 4 of [2] or ﬁg. 5 of [4]). Therefore we set

R = f R′

m. f is a factor as yet undetermined accounting for the fact that the

maximum is not exactly at R′

m but at slightly lower values. Replacing this

expression in (15) we get

Naively, one could set f = 1 and get

(where we have also set α = 2). This is the estimate for 1

k as given in

−

[9] and also in [2,10]. The previous formula gives poor estimates for the ex-

perimental results and in [9] it was suggested that the failure was due to the

approximations intrinsic to OBMs. We shall see, instead, that a little reﬁne-

ment to the above analysis gives us a rather good agreement with experiment.

We exploit the extra degree of freedom given by f : a reasonable choice for f

is to choose the value of R at which the capture cross section has a maximum

and set f = R/R′

m. It is more convenient, although lesser accurate, to look

8

(15)

(16)

(17)

for the maximum in bP (b) as a function of b. Since the equation d(bP )/db = 0

cannot be solved analitically we resort to a backward procedure: determine

by a least squares ﬁt the value of f which best interpolates the data and

check if this value corresponds to the maximum in bP . In ﬁg. (3) we plot

the experimental data from ref. [9], the naive expression (17), and the above

mentioned ﬁts. Computations have been repeated for the two couples of pa-

rameter α = 1, fT = 2 and α = 2, fT = 1. For the computation of P we have

used expression (6): using Eq. (13) would be a pointless complication.

Both ﬁts are fairly good, although obtained with widely diﬀerent values of f :

the choice α = 1 imposes f = 0.802, while α = 2 yields f = 0.492. In ﬁg. (4)

we plot the corresponding diﬀerential cross sections. The maximum of bP is

only faintly a function of the projectile charge. The case α = 2 gives a very

good accordance between the ﬁt and the actually computed diﬀerential cross

sections; thus, in this case, we can deﬁnitely state that the OBM is able to

predict the results of [9]. The case with α = 1 is slightly worse: the maximum

of the cross section is around 0.65

0.7.

÷

To summarize, being able to justify one apparently free parameter from

within the framework of the model itself is reassuring about its validity and its

ability of catching as much physics of the capture process as possible. On the

other hand, rather paradoxically, this makes even more puzzling the presence

of the remaining free parameter, α. We remind in fact that the choice α = 2

should be the correct one, in that it is consistent with the same starting

hypotheses which allow us to arrive at Eq. (12). It is however necessary using

α = 1 to be consistent with CTMC simulations, even though this means that

we are making the same kind of error done when using T instead of T ′

We have not at the moment a satisfactory explanation to this problem. It is

not unlikely, however, that the ultimate reason lies in the failure of expression

(2) for the electron energy E close to the saddle point. That expression,

9

in fact, holds rigorously only for large electron-projectile distances. At the

saddle point, instead, the electron-target and electron-projectile distances are

equivalent.

Abstract

In this paper, a quasistatic model is extended to describe the double ionization of Helium in
intense linearly polarized ﬁeld, yielding achieve an insight to the two-electron correlation eﬀect in
the ionization dynamics. Our numerical calculations reproduce the excessive double ionization and
the photoelectron spectra observed experimentally both quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover,
it is shown that the classical collisional trajectories are the main source of the double ionization in
the knee regime and responsible for the unusual angular distribution of the photoelectrons.

Recently the excessive double ionization observed in Helium experiments by Fittinghoﬀ et al. [1], Walker et al.
[2], and Sheehy et al. [3] draws much attention to the multiple-electron dynamics in the laser-atom interaction. In
these experiments the single ionization yields of He in a linearly polarized ﬁeld is accurately predicted by the single
active electron (SAE) approximation [2], well described by the Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) tunneling theory [4].
However, the case of double ionization is more complicated. In the regime of very high intensities (I > 1016W/cm2)
where strong double ionization occurs, the double ionization keeps in good agreement with the sequential SAE models
as that in the lower intensities regime(I < 1014W/cm2). The double ionization yield deviates seriously from the
sequential SAE model and shows a great enhancement in a ”knee” regime [(0.8—3.0) × 1015W/cm2], where the
He2+/He+ yields ratio is close to a constant: 0.002. This surprising large yields of the double ionization obviously
indicates that the sequential ionization is no longer the dominating process in this regime and the electron-electron
correlation has to be taken into account.

Both the “shake-oﬀ” model and the “recollision” model are suggested to describe the electron’s correlation [1,3,5,6].
However, none of the two nonsequential ionization (NSI) mechanisms can completely explain the experimental ob-
servations. For the “shake-oﬀ” model, it can not give the reason for the decrease in the double ionization yields as
the polarization of the laser ﬁeld departs from linear [7–9]. In the “recollision” model, the returning electrons are
known to have a maximum classical kinetic energy of ∼ 3.2Up (Up = e2F 2/4meω2), so one can determine a minimum
intensity required for the rescattering electron to have enough energy to excite the inner electron. But the double
ionization yields observed in experiments have no such an intensity threshold. In fact, the double ionization process
is rather complicated and subtle, both of the two NSI processes and the sequential ionization contribute to the double
ionization yields and may dominate in the diﬀerent regimes.

The experiments on the double ionization of Helium are mainly conﬁned in the tunneling regime, i.e. the ratio
between the tunneling time of the outer electron and the inverse optical frequency (Keldysh parameter) is less than 1.
In this regime, the quasistatic model [5] provides a perfect description for the Hydrogen-like atoms in the intense ﬁelds
and successfully explain the most nonlinear phenomena observed experimentally [5,10,11]. Inspired by this success,
in this paper we extend to develop a 3D quasistatic model (a two step process) to investigate the mechanism of the
double ionization of Helium by tracing the classical trajectories of the two correlated electrons. We attribute the double
ionization to the classical collisional trajectories: Distinct trajectory conﬁgurations corresponding to the ”shake-oﬀ”
and “recollision” mechanism contribute to the nonsequential double ionization of helium. Our numerical simulations
successfully reproduce the excessive double ionization and the photoelectron spectra observed experimentally in the
knee regime . The intuitionistic pictures of the double ionization will be provided by this model.

As a beginning, we present the improved two-step quasistatic model adopted in our calculations. The ﬁrst step that
the outer electron tunnels free, is treated by the tunneling ionization theory generalized by Delone et al. [12]. In the
second step, the evolution of the two electrons after the ﬁrst electron tunneled and the electron-electron interaction
are described by the classical equations (in atomic unit):

where F(t) is the laser ﬁeld.

In our model, the initial state of the inner electron of the Helium is described by a microcanonical distribution which
is widely used in the classical-trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) methods established and developed by [13,14]. The
CTMC method has been successfully used in studying the interaction of atoms with strong laser ﬁelds by numerous
authors [15,16], which provides a statistical distribution of all the parameters deﬁning the initial conditions of a
trajectory of the electrons in the ground state of a hydrogen-like atom. Then, the initial distribution of the inner
electron is

where H0(r2, p2) = p2
electron. Integrating the above equation, one obtains the momentum distribution

2/2me − Ze2/r2; K is the normalization constant; E2 = −2 a.u. is the eigenenergy of the inner

in which p2

c = 2meU, U is the negative energy of the inner electron.

The spherically symmetric ground-state He+ is represented by the above microcanonical distribution. This state is
speciﬁed by the binding energy of the electron in the target atom and ﬁve additional parameters randomly distributed
in the following ranges: −π ≤ φ ≤ π, −1 ≤ cos θ ≤ 1, −π ≤ η < π, 0 ≤ ǫ2 ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ χn ≤ 2π (Ref. [14]). Here, ǫ is
the eccentricity of the orbit, χn is a parameter of the orbit proportional to time, and φ, θ and η are Euler angles. A
random distribution of these parameters corresponds to equal probability of the inner electron having any phase in
its periodic motion. Here, 104 initial points are chosen and their momentum distribution is compared with Eq. (4).
Figure 1 shows that they are agreeable.

The initial condition of the tunneled electron, under the SAE approximation of He+, is determined by a equation
including the eﬀective potential given in Ref. [17] and a generalized tunneling formula developed by Delone et al. [12].
In parabolic coordinates, the Schr¨odinger equation for a hydrogen-like atom in a uniform ﬁeld ǫ is written (in atomic
unit),

in which Ip1 = −0.9 a.u. is the negative ionization potential of the outer electron.

The above equation has the form of the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation with the potential U (η) = −1/4η −
1/8η2 − ǫη/8 and the energy K = Ip1
4 . The turning point, where an electron born at time t0, is determined by
U (η) = K. In the quasistatic approximation, the above ﬁeld parameter ǫ relates to the laser ﬁeld amplitude F (t) by
ǫ = F (t0). One must point out, as ǫ > Fth, the turning point will be complex, which determines the threshold value
of the ﬁeld Fth = 0.338 a.u.

The evolution of the outer electron is traced by launching a set of trajectories with diﬀerent initial parameters t0
and v1x0, where v1x0 is the initial velocity perpendicular to the polarization of the electric ﬁeld. The initial position
of the electron born at time t0 is given by x10 = y10 = 0 , z10 = −η0/2 form the Eq. (5). The initial velocity is set to
be v1y0 = v1z0 = 0, v1x0 = v10. Thus, the weight of each trajectory is evaluated by [12]

Before we go further, we would like to compare our model with a similar model [19] describing the double ionization
of helium. First, in our model the initial condition of the inner electron is given by the classical trajectory Monte Carlo
method (CTMC); Second, the Coulomb interaction is described by the real Coulomb potential. These improvements
are essential. In the model given in Ref. [19], the inner electron is assumed to be rest at the center. This initial
condition conﬁnes the motion of both electrons in the same plane deﬁned by the polarization axis and the direction of
the initial transverse momentum., i.e., in fact, the calculations in their paper is a 2D system, which may increase the

2

probability of the collisions between the two electrons. On the other hand, the soften Coulomb potential approximation
adopted in Ref. [19] makes the inner electrons more easily to be excited and cause an overestimation of the double
ionization rate. Our model has been employed to understand the momentum distribution of the recoil ions and shown
a good agreement with the experimental records [20].

In our calculation, the Eqs. (1) and (2) are solved in a time interval between t0 and 13T by employing the standard
Runge-Kuta algorithm. After ten optical cycles the electric ﬁeld is switched oﬀ using a cos2 envelope during three
cycles, and during the last two optical cycles the electrons is free from the electric ﬁeld. So, the electric ﬁeld can be
expressed as

where F and ω are the amplitude and frequency of the ﬁeld respectively and the envelope function a(t) is deﬁned by

F(t) = a(t)F cos(ωt)ez,

The wavelength is λ = 780 nm, which is so chosen to match the experiment [2], and the intensities ranging from
I = 1014 W/cm2 to the threshold value I = 4 × 1015 W/cm2 .

In our computations, 105 or more initial points are randomly distributed in the parameter plane −π/2 < ωt0 < π/2,
v1x0 > 0 for the outer electron and in the microcanonical distribution for the inner electron. The probability for double
ionization and the angular distribution can be obtained by making statistics on an ensemble of classical trajectories
weighed by the (6). The results have been tested for numerical convergence by increasing the number of trajectories.
In our treatment, the behavior of the classical trajectories play an important role and determine the ionization
dynamics of the electrons. There are four kinds of typical trajectories. Fig. 2(a) shows a simple behavior: After
tunneled out, the outer electron will be driven mainly by the ﬁeld and directly run away. It collides neither with
core nor with the inner electron. Fig. 2(b) gives a more complicated picture in which multiple returns and long-time
trapping is experienced by the outer electron: The outer electron ﬁrst tunneled out, and then oscillate in the combined
laser and Coulomb ﬁelds. After several optical periods, it collides with the core and then absorb enough energy to
escape. In the above two cases, no double ionization occurs since the collision between the two electrons is slight.
Fig. 2(c) and 2(d) give the typical pictures of the double ionization process. In Fig. 2(c), the outer electron is born
at the regime close to the peak of the electric ﬁeld, then it oscillates in the combined laser and Coulomb ﬁelds. After
several optical periods, it returns back to the neighborhood of the core and collides strongly with the inner electron.
This collision provide enough energy for the inner bounded electron to get free. Fig. 2(d) shows that after the outer
electron is tunneled, the laser ﬁeld will reverse its direction within less than a quarter of the optical periods, so that
this electron will be driven back when the laser ﬁeld reverses its direction and collides with the inner electron near
the core and make it ionized. As we will show later, the resulting energy spectra and the angular distribution of the
photoelectrons for the two processes are quite distinct.

To match the experiments, Figure 3 shows the double ionization yields of helium calculated by making use of our
model at 13 diﬀerent intensities in the range 4 × 1014 − 4 × 1015 W/cm2. The dashed line is the single-ionization
yields of He predicted by the ADK tunneling rate [4], and the solid line is the ADK tunneling rate for He+. For peak
intensities below 3 × 1015 W/cm2 , one sees that the double ionization rate obtained from our numerical simulations is
larger than the ADK tunneling rate, but for the intensities above 3 × 1015 W/cm2, the ADK tunneling rate increases
rapidly and becomes larger than the ionization rate given by our model. This ﬁgure reads that our calculation is able
to reproduce, qualitatively at least, the excessive double ionization observed in helium experiments [2]. The inset
in Figure 3 shows the double ionization rate calculated by our model normalized to the ADK tunneling rate of He
versus the intensity. Our result is in good agreement with the data in the knee regime observed in experiments [2]:
He2+/He+ ratio in the knee regime is nearly around 0.002. At lower intensities (I < 0.5 × 1015/cm2), the deviation
between our calculation and the experimental records becomes serious. In conclusions, our model provides a suitable
description for the double ionization in the knee regime, where as shown above the classical collisional trajectories
(Fig.2c,d) are believed to be the main source of the double ionization. Above this regime, the tunneling ionization
of the inner electron will become a dominating process and the ADK description is available. Below this regime,
the ionization mechanism of the outer electron transits from tunneling regime to the multiphoton regime and the
tunneling description is no longer available.

Figure 4 shows the relations between the ionization rate and the phase of the laser ﬁeld when the outer electron
tunneled. One ﬁnds that the most double ionization yields come from the region (−0.2 < ωt0 < 0.4) close to the
peak of the electric ﬁeld. There is a tail for the regime ωt0 > 0.4 and a ’cut oﬀ’ for the ωt0 < −0.2. We know that
when the outer electron tunneled out near the peak of the laser ﬁeld, its canonical momentum is almost zero. Hence,

3

the outer electron tends to oscillate in the combined laser and Coulomb ﬁelds for several optical periods, and then
return back to the neighborhood of the core to collide with the inner electron. In this case, the typical trajectory of
the double ionization process corresponds to Fig. 2(c). For phase ωt0 < −0.2, the tunneled electrons have a nonzero
canonical momentum directing outwards from the core. Consequently, it will be driven by the laser ﬁeld and run away
directly from the core. That is, in this process, the outer electron has no chance to return to the core and no double
ionization occurs in the region. For phase ωt0 > 0.4, the outer tunneled electron has a nonzero canonical momentum
towards the core , and soon after it tunneled out the laser ﬁeld also reverses its own direction to the same direction.
So the electron will be driven back to the core by the external ﬁeld and collide with the inner electron. The Fig. 2(d)
shows the typical trajectory for this case. In this region the tunnel ionization of the outer electron is not eﬃcient,
and the double ionization rate is low. Comparing the two typical processes of the double ionization, one can ﬁnd
some intrinsic diﬀerence. In the Fig. 2(c) the outer electron was ﬁrstly ionized out, then driven by the ﬁeld to collide
with the inner electron and cause the double ionization, which shows a typical picture of the ‘recollision’ process. In
the Fig.2(d) the inner electron was ionized during the process when the outer electron was driven away from core by
the external ﬁeld, both electrons ionize simultaneously which possesses the properties of the ‘shake-oﬀ ’ mechanism.
The diﬀerence of the two processes manifests clearly in the energy evolution of the two electrons. As shown in Fig.
5(a), the outer electron is ionized free with a positive energy, then it comes back to collide with the inner electron.
This collision causes an sudden increment on the energy of the inner electron which becomes free soon. Because
the collisions between the two electrons is almost instantaneous so that the energy is conserved approximately when
collision happens. In the case of Fig. 5(b),during the escape process of the outer electron it collides with the inner
one. Consequently, both electrons are ionized free almost simultaneously. From our calculation we know that both
processes contribute to the double ionization in the knee region, but the main contribution comes form the ‘recollision’
process which gives more than 80% of the double ionization yields.

From our calculations, we can also obtain the photoelectron spectra (PES) and the photoelectron angular distri-
bution (PAD). Figure 6 shows the total photoelectron energy distribution at 1 × 1015 W/cm2 and 1.6 × 1015 W/cm2
(both of them are in the knee regime) calculated from our model. On can see that, in absolute units, an increasing
laser intensity results in the increase of higher energy photoelectrons. But if one scales the energy units by the
pondermotive energy Up = e2F 2/4meω2, of electron, one will ﬁnd that the PES for both intensities will show similar
shape: The spectrum exhibits a sharply decreasing slope (region I, 0–2Up) followed an extended plateau up to 8Up
or more (region II). This spectrum structure is much close to experimental observations in this regime [2].

We know that in our model the electron is initiated in the phase interval [−π/2, π/2], so the total photoelectron
angular distribution (PAD) has to consider the contribution of electrons originated in [π/2, 3π/2] which is the mirror
image with respect to 900. Figure 7(a) is the total angular distribution of ionized electrons. One ﬁnds that except for a
main concentration in the ﬁeld direction, there exists a long tail decreasing with a power-law dependence 1/(sinr(θ/2))
which is diﬀerent from the angular distribution for the pure tunneling nature where it decreases exponentially. This
structure is due to the scattering with the core and the interaction between two electrons during the rescattering
processions. Figure 7(b) shows the angular distribution of photoelectrons in the energy region II. The most striking
feature of the plots is the existence of a slight slope up to 400 followed by a tail up to 900. If one compares this result
with the angular distribution of the transition region in rescattering processes described in Ref. [10], where there is
no photoelectrons emitted at angles much larger than 400, it is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd that the tail structure is due to
the electron-electron interaction. Because the velocity direction of the inner electron is random when the collision
happens, the instantaneous strong interactions can give rise to large emission angle of the photoelectron. This can
be veriﬁed in Figure 7(c), which shows the angular distributions of the inner electron and outer electron in double
ionization respectively. This case corresponds to strong electron-electron interaction and the angular distributions is
almost ﬂat and the decreases is slowly when the emission angle increases.

In fact, the ﬁnal energy and angular distribution of the photoelectrons are greatly determined by the scattering
processes. The process shown in Fig. 2(a) only provides a relatively low energy for the photoelectron (region I) and
gives small emission angle (the ﬁeld direction). However, for the process shown in Fig 2(b), the classical trajectories
have complex behavior, and the energy exchange in this process is also complicated. The multiple returns and long-
time trapping can produce high energy electron in this process. So, this region contributes to the high energy part
of PES. It is also found that the structures of PES and PAD are similar to some extent to the rescattering model of
hydrogen [10]. This fact indicates that the main structures of PES and PAD come from the rescattering process of
the outer electron with the ion He+ .

In conclusions, a quasistatic two step model is used to investigate the double ionization of helium in intense linearly
polarized ﬁeld. Our calculations reproduce the excessive double ionization and the photoelectron spectra observed in
experiments. We argue that the classical collisional trajectories are the main source of the double ionization in the
knee regime and responsible for the unusual angular distribution of the photoelectrons. Two distinguished typical
collisional trajectories correspond to the ‘recollision’ process and the ‘shake-oﬀ’ process respectively. Both of the
two processes have contribution to the double ionization, but the ‘recollision’ gives the main contribution and leads

4

to more than 80% of the double ionization yields. Our calculations based on the classical trajectories provide an
intuitionistic picture of the double ionization of helium, and are helpful in understanding the complicated behavior of
multi-electrons atoms in intense laser ﬁelds, in the way of quantum approach and the future experiments observations.

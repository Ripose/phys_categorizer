Three bosonic, spin-polarized atoms in a spherical oscillator potential constitutes the simplest nontrivial Bose-
Einstein condensate (BEC). The present paper develops the tools needed to understand the nature of the complete
J = 0 energy spectrum for this prototype system, assuming a sum of two-body potentials. The resulting spectrum
is calculated as a function of the two-body scattering length asc, which documents the evolution of certain many-
body levels that evolve from BEC-type to molecular-type as the scattering length is decreased. Implications for the
behavior of the condensate excited-state spectrum and for condensate formation and decay are elucidated. The energy
levels evolve smoothly, even through the regime where the number of two-body bound states Nb increases by 1, and
. We point out the possibility of suppressing three-body recombination by tuning the
asc switches from
two-body scattering length to values that are larger than the size of the condensate ground state. Comparisons with
mean-ﬁeld treatments are presented.

I. INTRODUCTION

Mean-ﬁeld methods are commonly used to characterize Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), i.e., atomic alkali vapors
in an external trapping potential [1]. These approaches, which account for the interaction between particles through
a mean-ﬁeld term in an eﬀective single-particle Hamiltonian, accurately describe much of the dilute condensate
energetics. However, these shape-independent s-wave scattering length approximations break down for strongly
interacting gases with large interaction parameters [1–5].

Very recent experiments by Greiner et al. [6,7] have entered this regime: A quantum phase transition from a
superﬂuid to a Mott insulator was observed for ultracold atoms held in a three-dimensional optical lattice. Most
relevant to our studies here, the atoms are held in tight isotropic lattice sites with an occupancy of 1-3 atoms per
site. The experiment thus realizes a strongly correlated many-body (and in a sense, few-body) quantum system with
unprecedented control of parameters. In this paper, we present the quantal J = 0 energy spectrum of three particles
under external isotropic conﬁnement, and compare with results obtained using mean-ﬁeld theory.

The lowest order mean-ﬁeld approximation [Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) or Hartree-Fock (HF) equation] [1,8–11] and
also higher order approaches such as second order perturbation theory [12,13] treat the metastable BEC state of the
trapped alkali vapor as if it was the “true” ground state of the system. This means that these approaches cannot
describe recombination processes or atom-loss processes, since coupling to the true (solid-like/liquid-like) ground
state is neglected completely. Attempts to include additional “empirical” terms in these mean-ﬁeld equations, which
account for “reaction processes”, exist, and have been able to describe some experimental ﬁndings successfully [14–16].
However, the ad hoc nature of some of these empirical terms is less than satisfactory.

The nonperturbative quantal calculations permit us to circumvent these problems. These calculations come at a
price, namely, our initial restriction to only N = 3 particles with total angular momentum J = 0 in the trap. For this
“simple” system, however, we are able to include all channels in the calculation, molecular three-body bound state
channels, diatom plus atom channels, and metastable gaseous-like channels [17].

,
This paper focuses on regimes where standard mean-ﬁeld treatments break down. For large positive asc →
∞
the mean-ﬁeld treatment results in unphysically large diverging energies. In contrast, the three-body energies change
smoothly in the pole region, where the scattering length asc changes from
and the number of two-body
s-wave bound states Nb increases by 1. Additionally, our three-body study implies that the excitation frequencies are
well behaved around

The mean-ﬁeld treatment also exhibits limitations in the parameter range around the negative critical scattering
length acr, where acr is deﬁned through the instability criterion (N
0.575 derived from the mean-ﬁeld
equation [11,18]. The lowest gaseous energy level (i.e., the BEC ground state) changes its character from metastable
to molecular around acr, while some of the higher lying BEC-like states remain almost completely unaﬀected by
criticality. In contrast, the mean-ﬁeld equation simply has no solution for asc lower than the critical value.

Three-particle studies have been used previously to shed light on the many-body physics of BECs. In 1996, Esry et
al. [19] explored the role of the two-body scattering length in BECs. More recently, three research groups explained
experiments regarding the three-body recombination rate in many-atom BECs via three-body calculations that include
channel coupling [17,20–23]. Three-body studies have also been used to test the validity of shape-independent two-
body interaction potentials [24].

The studies presented here are based on time-independent Schr¨odinger wave mechanics. The energy levels show
several avoided crossings when plotted as functions of asc (see Section III); nevertheless, dynamical behavior such as
Landau-Zener-type branching ratios or recombination rates remains beyond the scope of this paper. Studies along
these lines will be a natural continuation of the static studies presented here.

Section II describes our three-body system, and outlines the formalism for its investigation. Section III presents
quantum mechanical three-body energetics, and Section IV compares with results derived from mean-ﬁeld treatments.
Finally, Section V summarizes our main results.

represents the Hamiltonian describing the relative particle motions in terms of three hyperspherical coordinates (R,

R−5/2ψ(R, ϑ, ϕ)φklm( ~X), in order to eliminate ﬁrst derivatives from the hyperradial kinetic energy operator.

Eq. (3) is solved here using two diﬀerent, but related approaches: a coupled-adiabatic-channels approach and a
strict adiabatic approximation. The coupled-adiabatic-channel calculation can in principle be made exact. The strict
adiabatic approximation can be viewed as an “incomplete” coupled-adiabatic-channel calculation, truncated to one
channel only, which neglects all oﬀ-diagonal coupling elements. It is important to keep in mind that the strict adiabatic
approximation cannot describe recombination processes.

To solve Eq. (3) we expand ψn(R, ϑ, ϕ) into radial wave functions Fνn(R) and a set of complete, orthonormal
angular channel functions Φν(R; ϑ, ϕ). The basis functions Φν, which depend parametrically on R, are solutions of
the partial diﬀerential equation

where Pνν′ [Qνν′] are angular coupling matrix elements involving the ﬁrst [second] derivative of Φν with respect to

setting the right hand side
mation follows immediately by neglecting coupling elements between diﬀerent channels [
of Eq. (5) to zero]. Another variant of the strict adiabatic approximation additionally neglects the diagonal element
Qνν, and is typically referred to as the hyperspherical Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In the following, we use
these two variants of the strict adiabatic approximation interchangably, and denote the eigenvalues by Eint
νn .

The outlined formalism splits the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation for the internal motion [Eq. (3)] into two
steps: i) solution of Eq. (4) (here via a two-dimensional B-spline code), and ii) solution of the one-dimensional coupled
equations, Eq. (5). The former is numerically more challenging due to its higher dimensionality, and coincides with
determining the bound and continuum channel functions Φν of three particles interacting via a sum of two-body
potentials V (r) [the trapping potential does not enter Eq. (4)].

For a vanishing interaction potential, V (r) = 0, the eigenfunctions Φν of Eq. (4) reduce to Gegenbauer polynomi-
als [29] with eigenvalues Uν(R) = ¯h2 λ(λ+1)+15/4
, where the λ = 2 state is forbidden due to symmetry
constraints, and the eigenvalues with λ = 12 and λ
16 are doubly-degenerate. Now consider a non-vanishing two-
body interaction potential V (r). Compared to the V = 0 potential, the non-vanishing V introduces three-body bound
states at small hyperradii R, accounting for the short range physics of V (r), and also modiﬁes the potential curves at
large R, reﬂecting the non-zero s-wave scattering length asc. Additionally, a non-vanishing V lifts the degeneracy of
the Uν(R) potential curves.

To illustrate this behavior, Fig. 1 shows the sum of the trapping potential, Vtrap = µω2

hoR2/2 with νho = 78kHz,
and the adiabatic potential curves, Uν(R), for a two-body model interaction potential (see Sec. III) with s-wave

s-wave binding energies in the absence of a trapping potential. The higher lying potential curves (solid lines) describe
metastable BEC physics, and would correspond to continuum states, in the absence of a trapping potential. The
ν = 2 curve (thick solid line) shows a double minimum structure with minima at R
2.5aho, which
are separated by a potential barrier. The lowest metastable state “lives” in the minimum at larger R. The lower
panel of Fig. 1 shows an enlargement of the gaseous region together with the eﬀective potential curves for a vanishing
interaction potential (dotted lines). Signiﬁcant deviations between the solid and the dotted curves (non-vanishing
and vanishing two-body potential, respectively) are visible.

As clearly demonstrated in Fig. 1, to properly describe the metastable states, one must solve Eq. (4) for hyperradii
R as large as 10aho, corresponding roughly to several 104a.u. (depending somewhat on νho). In our calculation, we
100asc
determine the adiabatic potential curves Uν and the coupling matrix elements Pνν′ and Qνν′ out to R
using a two-dimensional B-spline code, and then extrapolate to larger R. For the continuum potential curves we follow
a second independent approach suggested by Nielsen and Macek [20]. For large R, they recognise the dependence of
Uν on asc only, and derive a nearly analytic expression for Uν. Note, Nielsen and Macek’s formula does not account
for those potential curves, which simply coincide with the “unperturbed” eigenvalues ¯h2 λ(λ+1)+15/4

(see above). The nearly analytical expressions [20] are in excellent agreement with our continuum curves Uν calculated
through numerical solution (and extrapolation) of Eq. (4).

In passing, we note an additional nice feature of the outlined formalism. Suppose that we wish to study the
energetics of three particles in an external spherical potential as a function of the trapping frequency νho. For a given
interaction potential V (r), it is only necessary to solve the numerically most demanding Eq. (4) once. ωho then enters
the simple one-dimensional Eq. (5) simply through an additive term, which trivially determines the energy spectrum
versus ωho .

III. THE QUANTAL ENERGY SPECTRUM

This section presents the internal energies Eint for three bosonic particles with J = 0 in an external trap for
a two-body model potential of the form V (r) = d cosh−2(r/r0). This is convenient because the two-body s-wave
eigenenergies and eigenfunctions can be determined analytically [31]. Furthermore, we determined an analytical
expression for the energy-dependent s-wave scattering length,

Panel B corresponds to a much smaller scattering length than in panel A, asc = 103a.u.. This panel shows a series of

these crossings move to lower energies, until they ﬁnally vanish at asc = 97a.u.. The scattering length asc = 97a.u.
corresponds to a well depth d of the two-body potential V at which V ﬁrst supports a d-wave two-body bound state.
To calculate energy levels in the presence of a d-wave shape resonance we follow the potential curves that cross
diabatically. Note that the potential curves approach the V (rij ) = 0 curves (i.e., the dotted lines) as asc approaches
zero. Accordingly, the energy levels approach those of the ideal inhomogeneous gas.

Panel C shows the eﬀective potential curves (solid lines) for vanishing scattering length, asc = 0 (however, non-
vanishing V ), in which case the potential curves are almost identical to the ones for vanishing V (dotted lines). Small
diﬀerences occur in the inner wall region reﬂecting the existence of molecular states at small R. These molecular
states at small R are, however, not shown in Fig. 3.

In addition to the aforementioned issues, four more characteristics are important to the energy level scheme shown

close to those of the ideal gas. (ii) The energy level with energy Eint = 15¯hωho is unchanged over the two cycles
shown. This energy level originates in the “unperturbed” potential curve ¯h2 λ(λ+1)+15/4

therefore coincides with an ideal gas level. (iii) The internal energy levels in the ﬁrst cycle (Nb = 1) and in the second
cycle (Nb = 2) behave very similarly, indicating that the energies are, to a good approximation, independent of the
number of two-body s-wave bound states Nb. (iv) Notice in particular that the energy levels Eint

Note as well that families of plunging energy levels with molecular character are present, which to simplify our

(at [arctan(asc/aho)]/π
1.2), which reﬂects the transition of this BEC state to one of molecular character. The
other energy levels of this family also change character from gaseous-like to molecular-like as the two-body potential

So far we have discussed results for a trap with trapping frequency νho = 78kHz. In addition, we performed calcu-

the interaction parameter (N
before, a trapping frequency smaller than νho = 78kHz therefore leads to a narrower [arctan(asc/aho)]/π interval
than shown in Fig. 2. As an example, Fig. 4 shows the internal energies Eint

νho = 780Hz and Nb = 2 (solid lines). A few of the internal energies at large negative scattering length, corresponding

To summarize, our microscopic studies of the energetics of three conﬁned particles as a function of νho reveal that
the overall behavior of the energy level scheme (as shown in Fig. 2) remains unchanged as νho either decreases or
increases. As discussed in the previous paragraph, however, νho determines the range of the interaction parameter.
acr depends on νho. Figure 2 indicates a gradual decrease
Speciﬁcally, the behavior of the energy levels around asc ≈
of the condensate energy as the scattering length decreases through the region [arctan(asc/aho)]/π
2.1. As νho is
decreased, the separation between the molecular-like region at small R and the gaseous-like region at large R becomes
more pronounced, and the energy decrease (change from gaseous-like to molecular-like) takes place over a smaller
range of scattering lengths. In other words, the potential barrier (shown in panel D and E of Fig. 3 for νho = 78kHz)
spatially separates the molecular-like and gaseous-like region more for small νho than for large νho.

The internal energies discussed in this section have been calculated within the strict adiabatic approximation. To
assess the accuracy of this approach we additionally performed coupled-adiabatic-channel calculations. Figure 5 shows
the energies resulting from the coupled-adiabatic-channel calculation including four channels (pluses) together with
those resulting from the adiabatic calculation (dotted, solid, and dashed lines) for νho = 78kHz. Figure 5 indicates
excellent agreement between these two sets of calculations for small asc (left hand side of the ﬁgure), however, some
diﬀerences occur at larger asc (right hand side of the ﬁgure). To be more speciﬁc, the plunging molecular levels
(dotted lines) and the BEC levels in the lowest gaseous adiabatic potential curve (solid lines) seem to repell each
other at large asc due to channel coupling. In summary, for our time-independent studies here, the strict adiabatic
approximation describes the main characteristics of the energy level pattern as shown in Figs. 2 and 4 with suﬃcient
accuracy. To go beyond this static picture, however, the coupling between channels must be considered.

Studies including channel coupling [17,19] show that the primary recombination mechanism is related to the behavior

3asc translates into 5.8

IV. COMPARISON WITH MEAN-FIELD TREATMENTS

−

This section connects our microscopic studies with results obtained by mean-ﬁeld treatments. Consider the HF
treatment [11], which results in an equation identical to the GP equation, except for a change from N to N
1 in
the interaction parameter. The HF treatment does not take advantage of the decoupling of the center-of-mass and
the internal motion, and determines an approximate value for the total energy EHF as well as the orbital energy or
chemical potential. To compare our internal three-body energies Eint
νn (solid lines in Figs. 2 and 4) with the HF energy
EHF , we subtract the exact energy associated with the lowest center-of-mass motion, ECM
0 = 1.5¯hωho, from EHF ,
and refer to this quantity as internal HF energy Eint
HF . The approximate HF treatment could either lead to an error
in Eint
from EHF is therefore
somewhat artiﬁcial [32]. Figures 2 and 4 show the resulting internal HF energy, Eint

HF , or in both these quantities at the same time, and the subtraction of ECM

HF or in ECM

HF , as dotted lines.

For νho = 780Hz, the internal HF energy Eint

HF (dotted lines in Fig. 4) agrees favorably with the lowest gaseous-like
internal three-body energy (solid line). As discussed in Sec. III, Fig. 4 includes only a small range of interaction
parameters (N

HF is not surprising.

have a solution. This mathematical fact is typically interpreted as “decay of the condensate” [1,18]. The three-body
treatment reveals that the decay of the condensate is linked to the disappearance of a potential barrier (see, e.g.,
panels D and E of Fig. 3), which separates the molecular region at small R from the gaseous-like region at large R.
When the potential barrier has disappeared, the states associated with this potential curve have purely molecular
character. Thus, the energy levels in this potential curve change dramatically in the vicinity of acr, whereas most of
the energy levels belonging to other families change slowly around asc.

Our interpretation of the behavior of a BEC in the vicinity of acr agrees with that suggested by Bohn et al. for an
arbitrary number of particles [33]. Within the K-harmonic approximation, Bohn et al. [33] describe the interaction
between each pair of particles through a shape-independent delta-function potential, and make some approximations
about the behavior at small hyperradii, where the δ-function potential leads to divergences. These approximations
are conﬁrmed to be well justiﬁed, based on our calculations with shape-dependent two-body interaction potentials,
so that no additional approximations at small R need to be made. Taken together, these two studies highlight the
usefulness of the hyperspherical radius coordinate in interpreting dynamics of a BEC (see also [34]).

νn behave smoothly. Recall that the sign
(pole region) corresponds to the appearance of an additional two-body
change of the scattering length from
s-wave bound state. Coincidently, this corresponds to the existence of a hyperradial potential curve, which approaches
the corresponding (negative) two-body binding energy in the absence of the trapping potential asymptotically. Around
the pole region, this hyperradial potential curve is energetically close to the lowest potential curve with gaseous-like
character, and therefore, coupling between these two potential curves with molecular-like and gaseous-like character,
respectively, can occur.

For positive asc, the “standard” HF/GP treatment has been improved by including an additional mean-ﬁeld
term [2,35,36]. This modiﬁed treatment leads to an improved description of BECs with small and medium inter-
action parameters, however, exhibits divergences similar to that observed for the standard mean-ﬁeld treatment as
. Therefore the modiﬁed mean-ﬁeld treatment does not overcome the limitations of the standard mean-ﬁeld

treatment addressed above.

To improve upon the GP (or equivalently, the HF) treatment, several groups [37–44] developed mean-ﬁeld formalisms
within the shape-independent contact potential approximation. These approaches go beyond typically applied ap-
proximations by introducing a molecular ﬁeld, and are aimed at describing condensate physics in the presence of a
Feshbach resonance. Application of these formalisms to calculating the energetics as a function of asc, i.e., in the
would be useful. The present study may then be used to benchmark such
regions where asc ≈
treatments, and would thus provide a strong link between many-body and mean-ﬁeld treatments.

To make further contact with mean-ﬁeld treatments, comparisons between our three-body excitation frequencies
and those calculated within the random phase approximation can be made. This comparison will be discussed in a

V. CONCLUSIONS

This paper discusses microscopic studies for three 87Rb atoms interacting via a sum of simple two-body model
potentials under external conﬁnement. Our study is important in light of recent experiments of atomic gases trapped
in an optical lattice with an occupancy of 1-3 atoms per lattice site [6,7]. These experiments open the opportunity to
systematically study strongly-interacting few-body systems, and therefore enter regimes discussed in the present paper
from a theoretical microscopic point of view. The overall behavior of the zero temperature energy levels discussed
in Secs. III and IV is independent of the exact shape of the two-body potential, though the detailed behavior of the
energy levels and of the hyperradial potential curves at small hyperradii R depends on the shape of the two-body
potential. The goal of this paper is to point out the gross behavior of the energy levels as a function of the two-body
s-wave scattering length asc. Therefore, we consider only one class of two-body potentials. Our main results are
derived for a relatively large trapping frequency, νho = 78kHz. As pointed out in Sec. III, dependencies on νho exist,
however, the gross features of the energy level scheme are independent of the magnitude of νho.

Our time-independent calculations, performed mostly within the adiabatic approximation, include molecular-like
and gaseous-like states, whereas standard mean-ﬁeld treatments only treat the latter states. Our study reveals a
microscopic understanding of the decay of a BEC in agreement with a study by Bohn et al. [33]. Furthermore, the
present microscopic three-body study reveals a smooth non-diverging behavior of the energy levels around the pole
region where
, and provides a detailed picture of the corresponding physics through analysis of hyperspherical
potential curves.

Section IV compares our microscopic energy levels with those calculated at the HF level. While mean-ﬁeld theories
are commonly derived in the large particle limit, the HF equation is valid for any number of particles and density
(though it might result in a more accurate description for systems with large N and low density). The energy level
pattern for systems with more than three particles may diﬀer in detail from our three-body energy levels presented
here, however, the overall behavior will be similar and we expect our main conclusions to generalize to systems with
more than N = 3 particles.

Our study raises several discussion points. Most of all, we have only brieﬂy discussed the eﬀect of channel coupling
on the behavior of the energy level scheme (see Fig. 5). To obtain detailed information about the dynamics of the
condensate, inclusion of channel coupling, or at least a Landau-Zener-type analysis, is required. Such an analysis
would allow the following question to be addressed (see Fig. 2): Is it possible to form a BEC with positive asc that
resides in a hyperradial curve other than the lowest curve with BEC character, and then decrease asc until asc < acr
(e.g. through the use of a Feshbach resonance) without destroying the condensate? Answers to this question certainly
require a more detailed analysis, and will be left for future study.

To extend the present work to many (more than four) particles is computationally infeasible. We hope, however,
that our results can eventually be compared with modiﬁed mean-ﬁeld treatments that implicitly include molecular
states [37–44]. Our study may then provide an additional link between many-body and mean-ﬁeld physics. Lastly, our
work relates to various many-body treatments using hyperspherical coordinates [33,34,45,46] that neglect molecular
physics. (An exception is the recent study by Sørensen et al. [46], which includes molecular states explicitly.)

We thank B. D. Esry for providing access to his B-spline code, and J. Macek for suggesting that we apply Eqs. (4)

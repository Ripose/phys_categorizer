We have developed a source of cold LiH molecules for Stark deceleration and trapping experiments.
Lithium metal is ablated from a solid target into a supersonically expanding carrier gas. The
translational, rotational and vibrational temperatures are 0.9 ± 0.1 K, 5.9 ± 0.5 K and 468 ± 17 K
respectively. Although they have not reached thermal equilibrium with the carrier gas, we estimate
that 90% of the LiH molecules are in the ground state, X 1Σ+(v = 0, J = 0). With a single 7 ns
ablation pulse, the number of molecules in the ground state is 4.5±1.8×107 molecules per steradian.
A second, delayed, ablation pulse produces another LiH beam in a diﬀerent part of the same gas
pulse, thereby almost doubling the signal. A long pulse, lasting 150 µs, can make the beam up to
15 times more intense.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Techniques are currently being developed to form cold
and ultracold molecules for applications across many
ﬁelds of research [1, 2]. The applications include tests of
fundamental symmetries and time variation of fundamen-
tal constants, quantum information processing, quantum
chemistry and the physics of dipolar quantum degener-
ate gases. Cold molecules have more to oﬀer than cold
atoms, because of their vibrational and rotational struc-
ture. Polar molecules are of particular interest, their in-
teraction with electric ﬁelds being typically 2-4 orders of
magnitude larger than that of atoms. This interaction is
the basis of an important technique for producing cold
molecules, known as Stark deceleration [3]. Molecules
seeded in a gas pulse are cooled by supersonic expansion
to temperatures of order 1 K, but have a centre-of-mass
velocity of several hundred m/s. This is reduced in the
Stark decelerator by a time-varying inhomogeneous elec-
tric ﬁeld. Once brought to rest, the molecules can be
loaded into a trap [4] or a storage ring [5]. To date,
the deceleration technique has been applied to isotopic
species of CO [3], NH3 [4], OH [6, 7], NH [8], H2CO [9]
and, in our laboratory, YbF [10]. The ratio, R, of Stark
shift to mass serves as a ﬁgure of merit for Stark deceler-
ation. At 200 kV/cm, R = 0.189 cm−1/amu for OH and
0.114 cm−1/amu for ND3, the only two species to have
been brought to rest and trapped so far. It is a major
challenge to form beams of cold molecules that have suit-
ably large values of R at practical electric ﬁeld strengths.
The easiest molecules to produce at low temperature us-
ing a supersonic expansion technique are those that have
substantial vapour pressure at room temperature. How-
ever, many of these are unsuitable for deceleration be-
cause R is too low. Conversely, those species that are
most amenable to deceleration may be diﬃcult to pro-
duce in the ﬁrst instance. The lithium hydride molecule

falls into this second class. It is an excellent candidate
for Stark deceleration, having R = 0.388 cm−1/amu at
200 kV/cm. However, despite the large volume of liter-
ature on LiH, there are no reports of low temperature
beams.

The spectroscopy of lithium hydride has been very ex-
tensively studied, both theoretically and experimentally,
over many decades. LiH is suﬃciently simple that highly
accurate ab initio calculations of its energy level struc-
ture and physical properties are possible. For this reason,
and because of its low mass, it is an excellent system
for studying the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation [11, 12]. LiH is also of considerable as-
trophysical interest, particularly for its role in the evo-
In 1993, Stwalley
lution of the early universe [13, 14].
and Zemke published a comprehensive review of exper-
imental and theoretical work on the three lowest elec-
tronic states of LiH: X1Σ+, A1Σ+ and B1Π [15]. More
recent studies include extensive sub-Doppler laser spec-
troscopy of the A-X system [16], high precision studies
of the ground-state by emission spectroscopy in the far
and mid-infrared [12, 17], and the ﬁrst observation and
characterization of the C1Σ+ state [18, 19]. All the exper-
imental studies of gas-phase LiH have used hot sources.
The molecules were either studied directly inside a heated
cell, or an eﬀusive beam was formed, usually by passing
hydrogen gas through a vapour of lithium produced in-
side a heated crucible. A supersonic expansion source
of LiH was also developed, but the rotational tempera-
ture of the molecules produced was approximately 600 K,
far higher than anticipated [20]. The formation of the
molecule in the gas-phase is diﬃcult because, although
the overall reaction Li + (1/2)H2 → LiH is exothermic by
0.21 eV, the single-step reaction Li + H2 → LiH + H is
endothermic by 2.05 eV when the reactants are in their
ground states [21]. One is thus faced with the challenge
of producing the molecules at low temperatures while
simultaneously overcoming the 24000 K barrier to the re-
action. In this paper, we report the successful production
of sub-Kelvin LiH beams.

page, along x.

II. EXPERIMENT SETUP

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. The vac-
uum system consists of two DN200CF 6-way crosses,
evacuated by two 1000 l/s turbomolecular pumps and
separated by a skimmer with a 2 mm diameter opening.
A solenoid valve with a 1 mm diameter nozzle (General
Valve, Series 99) is inserted into the source chamber and
holds the carrier gas at a pressure in the range 2-6 bar.
A voltage pulse of typical amplitude 250 V and typical
duration 300 µs is applied to the valve, and a pulse of gas
is emitted with an approximately Gaussian proﬁle whose
length is ∼100 µs [22]. When operated at 10 Hz repetition
rate, as in all our experiments, the time-averaged pres-
sures in source and detection chambers are 10−4 mbar
and 3×10−7 mbar respectively. The temperature of the
solenoid valve can be controlled with 1 K precision in
the range 100-293 K, by regulating a ﬂow of nitrogen gas
through a cooling block that surrounds the valve. This
assembly is mounted on the end of a tube, allowing the
insertion depth of the valve and hence the distance from
valve to skimmer to be varied. For the experiments re-
ported below, we ﬁxed this distance at 110 mm. The
transverse position of the entire valve assembly can be
adjusted under vacuum.

The LiH molecules are produced by laser ablation of
a solid Li target mounted directly onto the face of the
valve, and displaced from the nozzle by approximately
1 mm along −y (see Fig. 1). The target is ablated using

light from a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (YAG1) providing up
to 450 mJ of energy at 1064 nm or 110 mJ at 355 nm in
a 7 ns pulse (Q-switched mode) or a train of 1 µs pulses
lasting for approximately 150 µs (long-pulse mode). To
investigate dual-pulse laser-ablation, light from a second
10 ns, 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser (YAG2), is introduced at a
small angle to the ﬁrst. The delays between valve, YAG1
and YAG2 triggers are computer-controlled with 50 ns
resolution.

The pulsed molecular beam passes through the skim-
mer into the detection chamber. Here it encounters the
LiH detector 271 mm downstream of the skimmer. A
fast ionization gauge (FIG) situated 59 mm further down-
stream measures the temporal proﬁle of the gas pulse
with a resolution of 5µs.

In the LiH detector, the molecules are detected by
time-resolved laser-induced ﬂuorescence in the ultra-
violet (uv). The laser system consists of a single-mode
cw Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent MBR110) pumped by an
8W Nd:YVO4 laser (Coherent Verdi V8) and frequency-
doubled inside a build-up cavity (Coherent MBD200).
The laser frequency is measured to an accuracy of
600 MHz using a wavemeter (HighFinesse WS-6). The
probe laser beam propagating along x and linearly po-
larized along z, excites LiH on single rotational compo-
nents of the A1Σ+(v′)−X1Σ+(v′′ = 0) transitions. The
choice of A-state vibrational quantum number, v′,
is
based on the eﬃciency for driving the transition with the
laser power available. With increasing v′ (in the range

v′ = 0 − 8), the required laser power decreases due to the
improving Franck-Condon overlaps, but the power avail-
able from the laser system also decreases as the transi-
tion frequency moves deeper into the ultra-violet. In our
experiments, we have used v′ = 2, 3, 4 at wavelengths
of 376.8, 372.0 and 367.2 nm respectively. The upper
state radiative lifetime is ≃30 ns, and non-radiative de-
cay processes are negligible [23]. The spectrum of the
resulting ﬂuorescence will contain discrete lines with sig-
niﬁcant intensity ranging from the excitation wavelength
in the uv out to 1100 nm. Light-collecting optics, con-
sisting of a spherical mirror (90 mm diameter, 30 mm fo-
cal length) and two condenser lenses (73 mm diameter,
55 mm focal length), form a 1:1 image of this ﬂuorescence
at the 8 mm×24 mm photocathode of a photomultiplier
tube (PMT, Hamamatsu R928P) operated in photon-
counting mode and aligned with the long axis parallel
to x. Scattered laser light is suppressed using a glass
ﬁlter (Schott GG400) placed in front of the photocath-
ode. On the v′ = 3 transition, this ﬁlter transmits <10−5
of the photons at the laser frequency, while transmitting
73% of all the ﬂuorescence. The photon rate at the PMT
is measured as a function of the time since ﬁring YAG1,
with up to 1 µs resolution. The resulting time-of-ﬂight
(TOF) proﬁle provides a measurement of the molecules’
speed and translational temperature, and the relative in-
tensity of rotational lines in the spectrum measures the
rotational temperature.

In addition to the probe laser system described above,
we also use a 10 mW, 670 nm diode laser (Hitachi
HL6714G) tuned to the D1 or D2 resonance lines of
atomic lithium. This laser has two uses. In the detection
region, it serves as a probe laser for lithium, allowing us
to measure the Li ﬂux in the beam. When directed onto
the target, it allows us to investigate the formation of
LiH by the reaction of excited-state Li with H2.

III. RESULTS

A. Single-pulse ablation

We begin by discussing the particular case of single-
pulse 1064 nm laser ablation of a Li target into a car-
rier gas of Ar(98%)/H2(2%) at 3 bar stagnation pressure
and 293 K stagnation temperature. The ablation laser is
Q-switched, providing a 7 ns pulse. Figure 2 shows the
typical signal observed on the fast-ionization gauge under
these conditions. To produce this data, we modulated be-
tween YAG1-oﬀ (solid line) and YAG1-on (dashed line).
The data shows that the ablation process results in a local
‘hole’ in the gas pulse. The depth and width of this hole
increases with increasing YAG1 power, and the position
of the hole relative to the centre of the gas pulse is ﬁxed
by the time delay between valve and YAG1 triggers. For
the data shown, this time delay was chosen to be 485 µs
in order to place the hole near the centre of the gas pulse.
It is known that, following ablation, the plume forms and

propagates to the gas jet on a sub-microsecond timescale
[24]. We therefore take the trigger for YAG1 as marking
the moment when the hole is formed. This is the origin
of time in Fig. 2. The arrival time of the gas pulse at the
FIG determines its central speed as 582 m/s. As in other
experiments using this type of valve, this speed is a lit-
tle higher than the expected terminal speed for an ideal
supersonic expansion of the gas, which is 557 m/s. The
inset in Fig. 2 is the diﬀerence between the signal with
the ablation laser on and oﬀ. It shows a small increase
in the gas density at short times, followed by a much
larger decrease at longer times. Collisions between the
hot, energetic ablation plume and the gas pulse result in
a loss of atoms from the carrier gas pulse, causing the
local decrease in the density. A natural interpretation
of the increase at short times is that additional energy
deposited through interactions with the ablation plume
leads to a slightly higher terminal velocity. Qualitatively,
this type of behaviour is observed for a wide range of
ablation power, valve voltage, valve-to-YAG timing and
YAG-target alignment, though the detailed shape of the
proﬁle changes considerably.

served at the LiH detector with the probe laser tuned
to excite the 7Li1H A1Σ+(v′ = 3)−X1Σ+(v′′ = 0) R(0)
transition at 805798 GHz. The signal is the average over
100 shots from the source, representing 10 seconds of in-
tegration time. The abscissa records the time since ﬁring
the ablation laser, while the ordinate gives the photon
rate measured at the PMT. We ﬁt a Gaussian (solid line)
to the time-of-ﬂight data, this being the expected proﬁle
when the translational temperature is low and the distri-
bution formed at the source is narrow [22]. The molecules
reach their terminal speed in a time much smaller than
their total time-of-ﬂight to the detector, and so the cen-
tre of the distribution immediately gives the mean speed.
Since, as we show below, the pulse of molecules has a very
narrow initial width (∼ 5µs), the width of the proﬁle at
the detector is an accurate measure of the translational
temperature. The speed and translation temperature ob-
tained from Fig. 3 are 628 m/s and 1.0 K respectively. We
observe slow drifts in the speeds and temperatures ob-
tained by this method which we attribute primarily to
changes in target condition. Analyzing several datasets
taken under nominally identical conditions many hours
apart, we measure a mean speed of 625±5 m/s, and a
mean translational temperature of 0.9±0.1 K. The veloc-
ity slip between the LiH and the carrier gas is a common
feature of seeded molecular beams.

Figure 4(a) shows how the LiH signal varies with
Nd:YAG pulse energy. The signal peaks at an ablation
energy near 55 mJ per pulse, coinciding with the appear-

4

ance of the ‘hole’ in the gas pulse roughly as shown in Fig.
2. This observation suggests that the signal-limiting pro-
cess involves a trade-oﬀ between the ablation yield and
the preservation of the gas-pulse. At low energies the ab-
lation yield, and hence the LiH signal, is small, while at
high energies the ablation plume destroys the gas pulse,
It follows that a

pulsed valve delivering higher peak gas densities in cor-
respondingly shorter pulses might yield higher LiH beam
intensities.

There is a time delay between the valve trigger and the
appearance of the gas pulse above the target due to the
mechanical response of the solenoid valve. To optimize
the LiH signal, the time delay between valve and YAG1
triggers needs to be chosen correctly. Figure 4(b), a plot
of our signal as a function of this time delay, shows that
the optimal delay is 385 µs. We note that this optimum
is approximately 100 µs shorter than the delay used to
centre the hole in the gas pulse, as in Fig. 2. This means
that it is optimal to form the ablation plume when the
leading edge of the gas pulse is above the target. Still
shorter time delays result in higher translational temper-
atures as well as lower intensity.

By integrating under the TOF proﬁle in Fig. 3 we mea-
sure the total number of photons detected per shot with
the probe laser tuned to resonance. Figure 5(a) shows
the data obtained upon scanning the laser frequency sev-
eral times over a 1.2 GHz region around this resonance.
The Gaussian ﬁt to this data (solid line) gives a FWHM
of 88 MHz, due to the Doppler width arising from the
divergence of the detected beam. We observe very simi-
lar resonances when the laser is tuned through the R(0)
components of the corresponding v′ = 2 and v′ = 4 tran-
sitions at 795734.0 GHz and 816375.0 GHz respectively
[16]. Figure 5(b) shows the same transition as in (a), but
for the 6LiH isotopic species. Taking into account the
change of laser intensity between datasets (a) and (b),
we determine the ratio of 6Li to 7Li in our source to be
7.7±0.5%, consistent with natural Li abundances. In or-
der to determine the ground-state fraction in our beam,
and hence the rotational temperature, we scanned over
the 7LiH R(1) resonance, as shown in Fig. 5(c). The sum
of the squared matrix elements for this transition is twice
that of the R(0) line. Taking this, and the change of laser
intensity into account, we ﬁnd the population ratio be-
tween the ground and ﬁrst rotationally excited states to
be N (J = 1)/N (J = 0) = 8.2 ± 2.5%. Assuming ther-
mal equilibrium amongst the rotational states, the cor-
responding rotational temperature is Trot = 5.9 ± 0.5 K,
signiﬁcantly hotter than the translational temperature.
Furthermore, by analyzing the time-of-ﬂight proﬁles, we
observe that the J = 1 molecules have a speed that is
5.9±1.3 m/s higher, and a translational temperature that
is 0.25 ± 0.07 K higher than the J = 0 molecules in the
same beam. This correlation indicates that the transla-
tional degree of freedom has not reached thermal equi-
librium with the carrier gas and that the rotationally
excited molecules are further from thermal equilibrium

than those in the ground state. A search for the R(2)
spectral line at 805336 GHz did not yield a signal, allow-
ing us to set an upper bound on the population ratio
N (J = 2)/N (J = 0) < 4%. This is consistent with the
rotational temperature determined above, but does not
help to constrain its value further.

Turning now to the vibrations of the molecule, it is well
known that this degree of freedom often decouples from
the expansion at a much higher temperature than the
others. To investigate this, we scanned the probe laser
over the 7LiH A1Σ+(v′ = 6)−X1Σ+(v′′ = 1) R(0) tran-
sition, and obtained the data shown in Fig. 5(d). Know-
ing the laser intensities and the Franck-Condon factors
[25], we deduce the population ratio between the ﬁrst
vibrationally excited state and the ground state to be
N (v′′ = 1)/N (v′′ = 0) = 1.5 ± 0.2%. The correspond-
ing vibrational temperature (assuming thermal equilib-
rium between the vibrations) is 468 ± 17 K. To inves-
tigate population in higher-lying vibrational levels, we
scanned a 4 GHz region centred on the 7LiH A1Σ+(v′ =
10)−X1Σ+(v′′ = 2) R(0) transition at 804948 GHz, but
did not observe a signal. The corresponding upper bound
on the v′′ = 2 population is N (v′′ = 2)/N (v′′ = 0) < 1%,
consistent with, but not further constraining, the above
vibrational temperature.

Finally in this section, we mention that ablation at
355 nm, rather than at 1064 nm, does not change signif-
icantly the LiH signal obtained. We also note that we
have not fully understood the LiH formation mechanism,
particularly the role played by the H2 in the carrier gas.

We ﬁnd that decreasing the H2 concentration does not
result in a decreasing LiH signal. Indeed, the signal re-
mains upon switching the carrier gas to pure argon, even
after thoroughly ﬂushing the gas-handling system. This
puzzling observation suggests that it is hydrogen released
from the target that is primarily responsible for LiH for-
mation, rather than hydrogen present in the carrier gas.

B. Beam intensity

We now estimate the ground state LiH ﬂux in our
beam, using the signal measured on the v′ = 3 R(0)
resonance. To ensure uniform laser power within the in-
teraction volume, we expanded and collimated the probe
beam and then selected the central portion using an aper-
ture of height (along y) H = 4 mm and width (along z)
W = 3 mm. The power passing through this aperture
was P = 2.3 mW.

The number of photons detected per shot is given by

p =

1
L2 Z Z

N (x, y)ǫ(x, y)s(x, y) dx dy,

where N (x, y), ǫ(x, y) and s(x, y) are the number of
ground state molecules per steradian, the detection ef-
ﬁciency and the number of photons scattered by each
ground state molecule, all in the interval dx dy around
the point (x, y) in the plane of detection. L is the dis-
tance from source to detector. The values of N , ǫ and s
are independent of y over the small interval deﬁned by

the probe laser, H. At the laser intensity used, there is
little power broadening, and only those molecules whose
transverse Doppler shifts are within the natural linewidth
contribute signiﬁcantly to the signal. These molecules are
conﬁned to a small region about the beam axis within
which N and ǫ are independent of x. With these simpli-
ﬁcations, we have

p = N ǫ(H/L2)(L/vz)

s(vx)dvx,

Z

where we have used the substitution x = Lvx/vz, vx and
vz being the speeds in the x and z directions.

s is a strongly varying function of vx due to the trans-
verse Doppler shift. The upper state lifetime is much
shorter than the time spent in the detector, and the prob-
ability of an excited molecule returning to the ground
vibrational state is only 3%. It follows that the number
of photons scattered by a molecule with transverse speed
vx is well approximated by s(vx) = 1 − exp[−R(vx)τ ],
R(vx) being the excitation rate for this molecule, and τ
the time taken to traverse the probe beam. When the
laser is on resonance,

Here, ∆ = 2πvx/λ is the Doppler shift, 2γ = 32.4 ×
106 s−1 is the natural linewidth of the transition [23], and
D2 = |hA, v′ = 3, J ′ = 1|ez|X, v′′ = 0, J ′′ = 0i|2 is the
squared matrix element of the dipole operator between
the initial and ﬁnal states. The latter can be factored into
a rotational part whose value is 1/3 and an electronic-
vibrational part whose value is 0.0486(ea0)2 [25]. Evalu-
ating the integral, we obtain p = 6.6 × 10−5N ǫ.
The detection eﬃciency may be written as

Here, qi is the fraction of ﬂuorescent photons in the emis-
sion line whose wavelength is λi. R, Tl, Tw, Tf and χ are

ity, lens transmission, window transmission, ﬁlter trans-
mission and PMT quantum eﬃciency. Ωl is the solid
angle subtended by the light-gathering lens (1.27 stera-
dians). The result is ǫ = 0.96% giving p = 6.4 × 10−7N .
We measured p = 29 photons per shot, giving us N =
4.5 × 107 molecules per steradian per shot. We estimate
the relative uncertainty on this value to be ±35%, taking
into account the uncertainties in all the quantities in-
volved in the calculation, including variations we observe
from one target spot to another (which is the dominant
contribution to the uncertainty).

The signal gradually decays as the ablated spot on
the target ages, reaching half its initial value after about
20,000 shots.

C. Resonant excitation of the Li 2p state

As mentioned above, the reaction Li + H2 → LiH + H
is endothermic by 2.05 eV when the reactants are in the
ground state. This value is reduced to 0.20 eV when the
lithium is excited to the 2p state.
It therefore seemed
possible that excitation of the Li would result in an en-
hancement of the LiH yield. When investigating this re-
action in a cell heated to approximately 800 K, Myers et
al. [26] did indeed ﬁnd a large enhancement of the reac-
tion rate when the Li was resonantly excited on the D1
and D2 transitions at 670.8 nm; they measured the cor-
2
responding reaction cross-section to be 0.10 ± 0.03˚A
. In
our experiments, we scanned the frequency of a 10 mW
diode laser over the D1 and D2 resonances and looked
for an increase in the LiH yield. No such increase was
observed, suggesting either that the reactants are suﬃ-
ciently energetic for the reaction to proceed eﬃciently in
the ground state, or that this reaction channel is not the
main LiH production mechanism in the source.

D. Dual-pulse ablation

Recent literature on laser-induced breakdown spec-
troscopy (LIBS) of solid targets reports large signal en-
hancements when a dual-pulse ablation scheme is used
(e.g. [27] and references therein). Typically, the two
pulses are temporally separated by a few µs. Enhance-
ments are reported for co-linear geometries where both
laser beams hit the target, and in orthogonal geometries
where one beam travels over the surface of the target,
which the other hits. The underlying mechanisms for
these enhancements are the focus of current research in
this area. Since our own experimental setup shares some
features with the LIBS technique, we searched for a sim-
ilar signal enhancement using the (near) co-linear dual-
pulse arrangement shown in Fig. 1.

We scanned the time-delay between the ﬁring of YAG1
and YAG2, modulating YAG2 on and oﬀ so as to obtain
the ratio of dual-pulse to single-pulse LiH beam inten-
sity at each time delay. The single-pulse signal was ﬁrst
optimized with respect to YAG1 energy, YAG2 energy,
position on the target and time-delay between the valve
and YAG1 triggers. Figure 6 shows typical results. The
data were taken with energies and spot sizes of 42 mJ,
4 mm (YAG1) and 19.5 mJ, 2 mm (YAG2). Figure 6(a)
shows the signal ratio as a function of the time delay
scanned with 2 µs resolution. Over most of the interval
from -10 to +40 µs, there is a clear increase in the signal
with the addition of YAG2. We believe this is due to
the formation of a second LiH cloud in a diﬀerent part of
the gas pulse: each plume interacts with only a narrow
(∼ 5 µs) slice of the gas. This idea is supported by the
5 µs wide region near zero time delay where there is no
increase in the signal. Here, the second plume has little
eﬀect because the gas is already optimally depleted by
the ﬁrst, as discussed in the context of Fig. 4(a). The

50 ns resolution. This revealed the much narrower dip
shown in Figure 6(b), when the ﬁrst and second YAG
pulses coincide within 250 ns. The signal decreases to
about 20% of the single-pulse value because the eﬀective
ablation intensity is approximately twice the optimum
value when the two pulses hit the target almost simulta-
neously. We have observed much broader signal-drops at
higher values of YAG2 energy.

For each data point in Figs. 6(a,b) there is a corre-
sponding time-of ﬂight proﬁle.
In 6(c), the solid line
shows the TOF proﬁle measured for single-pulse abla-
tion. The dashed line shows the dual-pulse TOF proﬁle
averaged over the data points between -10 µs and 0 µs
(the region between the dashed lines in (a)), while the
dotted line is the corresponding average for the interval
15 µs to 25 µs (indicated by dotted lines in (a)). We see
that when YAG2 ﬁres before YAG1 the proﬁle is broad-
ened on the early-arrival side, and when it ﬁres later it is
broadened on the late-arrival side. The molecules leave
the source as two separate pulses which, due to their ﬁ-
nite temperature, merge into a single broadened pulse as
they travel down the beamline. When YAG2 is delayed
by more than 50 µs, we observe two distinct peaks in the
TOF.

The logical extension of dual-pulse ablation is multi-
pulse, or long-pulse ablation, with a pulse length chosen
to match the duration of the gas pulse.
In this way,
the entire gas pulse would contribute to the molecular
signal. One convenient way to achieve this is to operate
the Nd:YAG laser without a Q-switch. In this case, the
laser undergoes relaxation oscillations emitting a pulse
train that lasts for approximately 150 µs and consists of
approximately 100 pulses, each of ∼ 1 µs duration. The
total energy output is roughly the same as in Q-switched
mode.

In order to observe a LiH signal in this mode, we found
it necessary to compensate for the much lower ablation
power by focussing the laser onto the target using a lens
placed one focal length (500 mm) away from the target.
We then observed a ground-state LiH signal whose inten-
sity increased with increasing ablation energy up to the
maximum energy available. The maximum size of the
signal obtained was approximately 15 times larger than
in Q-switched mode. Because of the much broader tem-
poral distribution of molecules at the source, we are not
at present able to comment on the translational tempera-
ture. The greatly increased signal is accompanied by very
large ﬂuctuations on the timescale of tens of seconds. We
attribute these ﬂuctuations to the drastic changes in sur-
face conditions that occur as the tightly focussed ablation
laser forms deep holes and broad craters in the target.
Initial experiments indicate that these large ﬂuctuations
can be minimized by continuously translating the target.
We are currently modifying our source so as to take full

asymmetry between negative and positive time-delays in
Fig. 6(a) arises because the pulse from YAG1 interacted
with the early part of the gas pulse, rather than the cen-
tral part (as discussed above, this choice optimizes the
single-pulse intensity).

We re-scanned the region around zero time delay with

advantage of the much larger signals obtainable in this
long-pulse mode.

F. Conclusions

We have produced a beam of LiH with a translational
temperature below 1 K. We observe a number of non-
equilibrium eﬀects in our beam: velocity slip, a rotational
temperature higher than the translational temperature,
an even higher vibrational temperature, and a rotational-
state dependence on the speed and translational temper-
ature. Despite these eﬀects, the majority of the molecules
are cooled to the ground state. In a ﬁrst step towards in-
creased beam intensity, we ﬁnd that long-pulse ablation
produces a far higher ﬂux than single-pulse ablation, due
to a more uniform loading of the carrier gas pulse. We
are exploring several promising avenues to increase the

8

intensity further - various targets and hydrogen donor
gases, ablation inside an extended nozzle, and electrical
discharge to dissociate the molecular hydrogen. We plan
to use our cold LiH beam in deceleration and trapping ex-
periments, with a view to reaching sub-mK temperatures
using a second-stage cooling scheme such as sympathetic
cooling [28] or cavity-assisted cooling [29].

Interference of Resonance Fluorescence from two four-level atoms

In a recent experiment by Eichmann et al., polarization-sensitive measurements of the ﬂuores-
cence from two four-level ions driven by a linearly polarized laser were made. Depending on the
polarization chosen, diﬀerent degrees of interference were observed. We carry out a theoretical and
numerical study of this system, showing that the results can largely be understood by treating the
atoms as independent radiators which are synchronized by the phase of the incident laser ﬁeld. The
interference and its loss may be described in terms of the diﬀerence between coherent and incoherent
driving of the various atomic transitions in the steady-state. In the numerical simulations, which
are carried out using the Monte Carlo wave function method, we remove the assumption that the
atoms radiate independently and consider the photodetection process in detail. This allows us to see
the total interference pattern build up from individual photodetections and also to see the eﬀects of
superﬂuorescence, which become important when the atomic separation is comparable to an optical
wavelength. The results of the calculations are compared with the experiment. We also carry out
simulations in the non steady-state regime and discuss the relationship between the visibility of the
interference pattern and which-path considerations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Young’s two slit experiment is the canonical experiment demonstrating the wave nature of light. With the addition
of a measuring device to determine which slit the photon has passed through, the phenomenon of wave-particle duality
can be investigated. Many such path detection schemes have been proposed in the past, such as the Einstein recoiling
slit [1] and Feynman’s light microscope [2].

Recently, interest has arisen in the interference of the ﬂuorescent light from two driven atoms which play the role
of the slits in Young’s experiment. Various situations have been theoretically studied, using two-level and four-level
atoms, and the possibility of placing the atoms in a cavity has also been considered. [3–5]

In a recent experiment performed by Eichmann et al. [6], the light scattered by two 198Hg+ ions in a trap was
observed. In this experiment, a linearly-polarized traveling wave coherent ﬁeld was used to drive the ions and the
scattered light was observed in two orthogonal polarizations. An interference pattern is observed in one case but not
in the other. These results were explained in two ways, ﬁrstly in terms of a which-path argument based on ways in
which a single photon can interact with the two atoms and secondly in terms of a theoretical analysis by Polder and
Schuurmans [7] who considered coherent driving of a single four-level atom.

In this paper, we carry out an analysis which considers the presence of both atoms and stress that for the coherent
steady-state excitation as used in the experiment, the which-path argument is not applicable. In sections II to V, we
extend the analysis of Polder and Schuurmans to the experimental situation. In brief, the atomic dipoles are only
coherently driven in a speciﬁc direction given by the polarization of the incident light ﬁeld, and so interference is only
expected for scattered light of that polarization. Scattered light of the orthogonal polarization is also present, since
the atoms can decay spontaneously, but this is incoherent with the driving ﬁeld and does not lead to interference.

Besides the above analysis which is carried out using the master equation, a Monte Carlo wave function simulation
was also carried out, as is discussed in sections VI and VII. We use the method to simulate the system without
resorting to the assumptions of large atomic separation and independent radiators used in the previous analytical
sections. When a ﬂuorescent photon is detected as traveling in a given direction, it may not be possible in general
to determine from which atom it arose, and this leads to additional “dipole-dipole” type of terms which become
important when the atomic separation is comparable to the optical wavelength. At small separations, the atoms
act cooperatively giving rise to superﬂuorescence whereas for large separations, we smoothly recover the results for
independent radiators.

In order to compare our results with the experiment, we include the eﬀects of the classical motion of the ions within
the trap (Sec. VIII). As expected, this reduces the visibility of the interference patterns, bringing the results more
closely to those observed.

In the last section (Sec. IX) we consider a situation where the two atom system is re-prepared to its initial state
after each individual photon has been detected. This allows us to study the transient regime of this system and we

1

ﬁnd that interference is present in both polarizations, although one of these disappears in the steady-state. Depending
on the initial state however, the visibility of this transient pattern varies, and a which-path argument may be used in
this case to explain the results.

II. THE MODEL

The atoms are modeled as four-level atoms (see ﬁg. 1) interacting with a linearly polarized light ﬁeld polarized
along the z axis and traveling along the y direction. We treat the incident laser light as a classical ﬁeld and the
external motion of the atoms will be neglected. The separation between the atoms will be considered to be large
(many wavelengths of the laser light) so that dipole-dipole interactions can be ignored. In this approximation the
atoms can be considered as independent ﬁxed sources except that their radiation is synchronized by the deﬁnite phase
of the incident laser light. The atomic dipole operator ~µ is the sum of atomic raising µ↑ and lowering µ↓ operators

III. THE OPTICAL BLOCH EQUATIONS

There are sixteen optical Bloch equations corresponding to the sixteen atomic operators. However, due to the
geometry chosen for the incident light, the sixteen equations de-couple into two sets of eight. The ﬁrst set of coupled
equations involve the populations and the “linear coherences” (
terms) which relate to the z component

where ∆ = ∆/Ω and γ = γ/Ω. As expected from the symmetry of the situation, the populations of the two ground
states are equal as are the populations of the two excited states.

A graph of the populations versus laser light strength is shown in ﬁg. 2(a). For strong ﬁelds the atom is saturated
with all the populations equal to one quarter. For weak ﬁelds, the excited states are close to zero with the ground
states close to one half. The linear coherences are shown in ﬁg. 2 (b). Since the coherences are purely imaginary we
plot the imaginary part of
. We see that as the ﬁeld strength increases the coherences grow and reach
2/3. There is a gradual loss of coherence as the ﬁeld is further increased due to the saturation of the
a peak for Ω/γ
atom. At low ﬁeld strengths the atom spends most of its time in the ground state and is very rarely pumped to the
excited states. It behaves like a coherently driven linear oscillator and scatters coherently. In the strong ﬁeld case, the
atom undergoes Rabi oscillations and is frequently pumped to the excited states from which it spontaneously decays.
These spontaneous emission events destroy the coherences.

The other four equations for

IV. THE INTERFERENCE PATTERN

We have calculated in the previous section the steady-state solutions for the atomic coherences and populations for
the case of a single four-level atom interacting with a classical laser light ﬁeld linearly polarized along the z axis. In
this section we wish to use these to calculate the far-ﬁeld interference pattern from two such atoms in the case when
their separation is large enough that they may be treated independently.

Let us consider a screen placed in the far-ﬁeld (large y) and oriented in the xz plane. In the far-ﬁeld, and in the
paraxial approximation, the electric ﬁeld at a point on the screen at time t due to an oscillating dipole is proportional
to the projection onto the plane of the screen of the acceleration of the dipole moment at the retarded time t
τ,where
τ is the light travel time from the dipole to the observation point. We shall label a point on the screen by (τ1, τ2)
where these are the light travel times from each of the atoms to the point on the screen. The intensity of the light at
this point is

−

where

are the atomic dipoles of the ﬁrst and second atoms respectively and ω is the angular frequency

are zero in the steady-state since
we note that the cross terms like

U

}

We have factorized the products above since we have assumed that the atoms are independent. The intensity of the
interference pattern when all the light is detected is given by

where the additional phase term φo has been included to allow for the phase of the incident light to diﬀer at the
positions of the two ions. If this is normalized by twice the intensity due to single atom ﬂuorescence, we obtain

We note that this interference pattern is the sum of an incoherent term and a coherent term and so the visibility is
always less than one half. If we introduce a polarizer at angle η to the z axis in front of the screen, it is possible to
separate out the two components. The expression for the intensity is then

Thus if we detect the x polarized light by setting η = 90◦, we see that the visibility is zero for any ﬁeld strength
and detuning. On the other hand if the polarizer is set along the z axis (η = 0) then the visibility is non-zero. This
visibility is plotted against ﬁeld strength in ﬁg. 3 for various detunings with the polarizer aligned with the z axis
(η = 0). The maximum theoretical visibility of one occurs for all detunings in the limit of zero ﬁeld strength. As the
ﬁeld strength is increased the visibility falls towards zero, with the detuning determining the rate of this drop.

V. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS

In the experiment of Eichmann et al. [6] the incident laser is linearly polarized at an angle of 62◦ degrees to the z axis
in the yz plane. This gives a y component to the atomic dipole which is not considered in the above calculation, but
this does not aﬀect the ﬁeld on a screen in the xz plane. The inclination also introduces a non-zero phase diﬀerence φo
between the two atoms which has be included in our calculations. For more general orientations of the incident ﬁeld,
we resort to numerical simulations as described later 2. Another diﬀerence between our analysis and the experiment
is that instead of rotating a polarizer in the output ﬁeld, a ﬁxed Brewster plate is used and the polarization of the
incident light is changed. Our analysis is not valid for incident light polarized along the x direction, however our use
of a rotating polarizer gives some insight into the polarization-sensitive measurement.

Taking into account the geometry of the experiment, we expect that the measured interference pattern should be

to the incident light and λ is the wavelength of this light.

The visibility measured in the experiment when all the light was collected had a value of 0.2. The maximum
visibility from eqn. 36 is one half. This less than “ideal” measured visibility is not surprising since many detrimental
factors have not been included in the analytical treatment. Factors such as stray light entering the detector and
quantum jumps to other levels in the Mercury ions so that we may observe only the ﬂuorescence from one ion. [8] The
motion of the ions in the trap also smear out the interference pattern, this will be discuss in detail in a later section.

VI. NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE SYSTEM

In this section, we describe the use of a Monte Carlo wave function method for numerical simulation of the system.
This approach allows greater ﬂexibility in specifying the geometry of the incident light and also allows us to include
the photodetection process as part of the simulation. By doing this, we no longer simply relate the far ﬁeld intensity
of the ﬂuorescent light to the moments of the atomic variables, but explicitly consider how atomic quantum jumps
introduce photons into electromagnetic ﬁeld modes propagating in various directions. The advantage of this approach
is that it allows the atoms to be separated by arbitrary distances and takes into account the dipole-dipole correlations
between the atoms. This simulation approach is very closely related to the actual experimental situation as it gives a
time-resolved classical record of photocounts at diﬀerent angles which gradually build up into an interference pattern.
For simplicity, we assume idealized unit eﬃciency photodetectors in the far ﬁeld covering the entire 4π steradians
surrounding the two atoms. Each detector is assumed to be polarization-sensitive and resolves detected photons into

2A numerical simulation will be introduced later which can simulate the geometry of the incident light in a more ﬂexible
manner.

two orthogonal linear polarizations. Working in spherical polar coordinates with polar angle θ and azimuthal angle φ
(see ﬁg. 4), we use the unit vectors ˆǫθ and ˆǫφ as a basis for the polarization of the emitted photon. These unit vectors

This gives four times the decay rate of a single atom instead of two times for the case of large separation since the
interactions between the atoms grow as the separation decreases until at zero separation the size of these dipole-dipole
terms become of the same order as the population terms. This gives rise to superﬂuorescence where the two atoms
behave as one. This is clearly illustrated by the factorization of the above expression into the coherent sum of the

In order to carry out the Monte Carlo simulation, a wave function is evolved using the Schr¨odinger equation with the
non-Hermitian eﬀective Hamiltonian until the square of the norm of the wave function reaches a threshold drawn from
a uniform distribution lying between zero and one. At this time, it is necessary to select one of the possible quantum
jumps. The probability density of detecting a ﬂuorescence photon traveling in direction (θ, φ) with polarization ǫi is
given by

Conventionally, a Monte Carlo simulation requires many runs to be carried out to obtain the desired statistics of
the system from an ensemble of quantum trajectories. For the problem being considered, the result of one quantum
trajectory gives the photo-emission record for the two atom system, and we can let this single trajectory run as long
as it is necessary to obtain the required number of photons.

VII. NUMERICAL RESULTS

The raw output of these simulations is a list of the emission times, directions and polarizations of each emitted
photon. The direction is represented by the two angles θ and φ , with the polarization aligned either with the unit
vector ǫθ or ǫφ.

The wavelength of the incident laser light used in all of the following numerical simulations was 194nm. In the
ﬁrst simulation we have chosen parameters which gave maximum visibility of the interference pattern. The laser ﬁeld
was weak, the ratio of Rabi frequency to decay rate being 0.2. The atomic separation was set at 0.5µm so that ﬁve
intensity peaks would be observed as θ is varied through 180◦. This gives a suﬃcient number of points in order to
clearly distinguish each peak with the number of photodetections simulated. The incident light is propagating along
the y axis.

The intensity pattern as seen on a sphere around the ions is shown in ﬁg. 6 for incident light polarized in the z
direction. Since the system is symmetric about the z axis, ﬁg. 6 (a) shows an interference pattern as θ (but not φ) is
varied. Fig. 6(b) is another simulation in which the incident light is linearly polarized along the x axis. Even though
the system is no longer symmetric about the z axis, there is little dependence of the interference on the angle φ. We
shall henceforth only plot the interference patterns as functions of θ, and integrate over the angle φ. This integration
over φ modulates the intensity distribution with a sinusoidal envelope since the solid angle integrated over at the
equator (θ = 90◦) is greater that at the poles (θ = 0◦ or 180◦).

For the case of incident light polarized in the z direction, ﬁg. 7(a) shows the intensity distribution for ǫθ polarized
light as a function of angle θ from a simulation consisting of one hundred thousand quantum jumps. Out of these,
about half were detected with ǫθ polarization. The histogram5 is computed using a bin width of 1◦. An interference
pattern is clearly visible. From eqn. 35, we expect a visibility of 25/27 or about 0.9 but the visibility measured from
the simulation is approximately 0.7. However eqn. 35 is only valid in the paraxial approximation and only considers
photons polarized in the z direction. When this approximation breaks down (i.e., when θ is no longer close to 90◦),
the ǫθ polarization will include contributions from the components of the atomic dipole other than σz. These will

reduce the total visibility as we do not expect interference from the x and y components of the atomic dipole which
are not coherently driven. If we now look at the orthogonal polarization (the ǫφ polarization) as shown in see ﬁg. 7(b),
there is no interference pattern. The ǫφ polarization is always perpendicular to the z axis for any angle θ so only the
x and y components of the atomic dipoles contribute.

We now consider the case where the incident laser light is polarized along the x axis instead of the z axis. The
histogram for the intensity of ǫθ polarized light versus θ is shown in ﬁg. 8(a). There is no obvious interference pattern
now since the θ polarization consists mainly of the z component of the atomic dipole for angles around θ = 90◦.
Small peaks can be seen at about 40 and 140 degrees, which are due to the x component of the atomic dipole which
contribute in larger amounts as the θ deviates signiﬁcantly from 90 degrees. Fig. 8(b) displays interference as expected
since the φ polarization only consists of the x and y components of the atomic dipole. Since the incident light is
linearly polarized along the x axis, the y component of the scattered light is not coherent and the visibility should be
less than seen in 7 (a). From the central peaks the visibility is about one third, approximately half that for the case
of light polarized in the z direction.

VIII. EFFECTS OF MOTION

We have so far ignored the eﬀects of the motion of the ions as this has been secondary to our goal of demonstrating
how the visibility of the interference pattern varies with polarization. However it is a signiﬁcant eﬀect in the experiment
performed by Eichmann et al. We shall model the motion of the ions as harmonic oscillators for each of the three
main modes, one involving stretching and two involving tilting [6,12]. The stretching mode involves motion of the
atoms along the z axis whereas the two tilting modes involve motion in the xy plane. Thus the stretching mode alters
the distance between the ions and the period of the interference pattern while the tilting modes change the angle θ of
the photon emission displacing the interference pattern. Both of these eﬀects smear the interference pattern, reducing
the visibility.

The temperature of the ions in the trap were around the milli-Kelvin region and the frequency of oscillation of
the modes were of order of a MHz. By comparing the thermal kinetic energy of an ion kBT /2 with the separation
102 and so the motion may be treated classically. The ions
of the trap energy levels, ¯hω, we ﬁnd that kBT /(2¯hω)
≈
experience micromotion within the trap and the recoil momentum of the photon emissions may be neglected.

In the actual experiment, the values used for the separation between the ions was around 5µm. These values are
about ten times larger than the values used in the simulations. Thus we expect to see over ﬁfty peaks over a range of
one hundred and eighty degrees. We carried out a simulation with an ion separation of 3.35µm, where one hundred
thousand jumps was performed. In ﬁg. 9(a), we show the results for incident light which is linearly polarized along
the z axis, with no motion of the ions. The peaks are poorly resolved and an excessive length of time would be
required to obtain sharper resolution for such ﬁnely separated peaks. Note that in this graph, the detector is taken
to be polarization insensitive and we count all the photons. Fig. 9(a) shows the correct period (nine peaks from 75 to
105 degrees) with a visibility of about 0.35 which is lower than the predicted value of 0.46 using eqn. 32.

The geometry of the incident light in the simulation diﬀers from the that of the experiment. The light is propagating
along the y axis in the simulation whereas the experiment has the incident light at an angle of 62o relative to the z
axis. However, the experiment does not detect light over the entire 4π steradians, only a small portion is actually
observed. This observation region is a small disk perpendicular to the y axis. By summing over the φ angle in the
simulation and considering only θ angles close to the y axis we have an approximation of the experimentally observed
region of interest.

10−6s) is far longer than the atomic half-life τ1/2 (

The micromotion is simulated in two ways. We keep track of the oscillatory motion of the stretch mode starting
with some arbitrary initial value. Since we are interested in the long time (steady-state) regime the actual initial value
we choose is unimportant. The previous numerical procedure is re-used but the atomic separation is altered for every
photon emission according to the displacement of the stretch mode. This is valid because the characteristic time scale
10−8). The steady-state regime is
of the stretch mode τstretch (
satisﬁed since the duration of a simulation, τsim, producing one hundred thousand photodetections is approximately
10−3s which is much longer than the time scale of the stretch mode. The eﬀects of the tilting motion is to shift
the interference pattern. Thus during the simulation whenever we calculate a photodetection, the direction of the
photon needs to be shifted according to the current displacement of the tilting modes. The x and y displacements
are randomly generated from a harmonic oscillator probability distribution. In hindsight we could have generated z
displacements from a harmonic oscillator distribution as well, however in the simulations we have chosen to keep track
of the stretch mode starting from some arbitrary value. Both methods are equivalent for the steady-state regime.
The requirements on the time scales involved is

(58)

As expected, when classical motion is included in the simulation, the visibility of the interference is reduced, see
ﬁg. 9(b). We see an interference pattern with the peaks placed in the same positions as ﬁg. 9(b) but with a reduced
visibility of about 0.28. The visibility for individual peaks degrades as one deviates from the central peak at ninety
degrees. This maybe explained by the fact that we have modeled the motion along the z axis as a stretching where
the center-of-mass remains stationary, thus the central peak is in the same position whatever the period. As one
deviates to the sides, a small change in period has a increasingly larger eﬀect on the position of the peak. The
parameters used in this simulation for the motion were: stretch frequency ωstretch/2π = √3 MHz, tilt frequencies
ωtilt/2π = √5/2 MHz (for both modes), radial conﬁnement was 30nm and the amplitude of the stretch mode was
150nm. Experimental results were shown in the paper by Eichmann et al. for this set of parameters. The visibility
was about 0.2 which is less than the value obtained in the simulation. The greater visibility in the simulation is not
unexpected since the eﬀects of stray light and the fact that 198Hg+ ions are not ideal four-level atoms would further
reduce the visibility.

IX. THE TRANSIENT REGIME

So far we have investigated the steady-state regime which corresponds to the experimental situation. However the
transient regime is also interesting because it is then possible to consider the which-path argument which explains the
disappearance of an interference pattern as being due to information of which atom has undergone an emission being
somehow recorded in the system. This knowledge can be obtained for some initial atomic states but not others.

In this section, we consider that the two atoms are initialized to some known state and then are exposed to the
incident light. When the ﬁrst ﬂuorescence photon is detected, the experiment is stopped and the atoms are re-
initialized to the original state. Over many trials, an interference pattern may develop in the far ﬁeld, and it is this
pattern which is of interest.

it is not possible to tell from which atom the light came from. We thus expect that the detection of light polarized in

The results of a simulation with this initial state are shown in ﬁg. 10(a) for ǫθ polarization and in ﬁg. 10(b) for
ǫφ polarization. The atomic separation was 500nm and the ratio of Rabi frequency to decay rate is 0.2 as before.
As expected, a very distinct interference pattern can be seen in (a) consisting of ﬁve peaks. The visibility is about
0.88, this is quite close to the expected theoretical value of about 0.9. For the same set of parameters this transient
simulation gives higher visibility than the corresponding steady-state simulation. Also as expected, no interference is
seen in (b).

Let us now consider the initial joint atomic state

possible to distinguish the atom responsible for emitting the photon whether it is detected in the ǫθ or the ǫφ
polarizations. We thus expect to see interference for both polarizations. The result of the simulation for the ǫφ
polarization is shown in ﬁg. 11, conﬁrming that this interference does occur in the transient regime. As discussed
previously however, since the driving ﬁeld is polarized in the z direction, this coherence must approach zero in the
steady-state and there can be no steady-state interference pattern, although interference does occur in the transient
regime.

In the transient regime we expect interference in the undriven polarization which does not appear in the steady-state
regime for the majority of the possible initial states. The interference we see here is due to the presence of initial
coherences. It is similar to the case of two two-level atoms prepared in the excited states, one would eventually decay
emitting a photon in the process. The atoms are then re-prepared in the excited states and the process is repeated
to build up an intensity pattern. It is not important in this regime whether there is coherent driving or not but only
that the atoms are excited to higher levels thus giving them an opportunity to undergo spontaneous emission.

X. SUMMARY

We have analyzed the experiment by Eichmann et al. and presented theoretical models for understanding the
degree of interference observed for diﬀerent incident and detected polarizations. For a simple geometry of the incident
ﬁeld, it is possible to solve the optical Bloch equations analytically for a single four-level atom in the steady-state,
and to extend this result to the case of two atoms, assuming that they radiate independently. From this analysis, the
ﬂuorescent light is seen to consist of a coherent component which exhibits interference and an incoherent component
which does not. These components may be separated out by polarizers before the light is detected.

In order to model the actual geometry of the source polarization used in the experiment, a numerical technique
based on the Monte Carlo wave function method was used. In this method, the photodetection process is simulated
so that the interference pattern builds up gradually from a series of detections at various angles. This qualitatively
reproduces the experimental results and also allowed us to consider dipole-dipole interactions which become important
when the atomic separation is reduced.

To more closely simulate the experimental conﬁguration, classical motion of the ions was included in the simulation.
This reduces the visibility of the interference to a value closer to the experimental result. The residual discrepancy
is probably due to the approximation of modeling the ions as four-level atoms and experimental factors such as the
presence of stray light on the observation screen.

Finally, we demonstrated the formation of a transient interference pattern in situations where there is no steady-
state pattern by resetting the atomic state to a speciﬁed initial condition after each photodetection. In this case, a
which-path argument can be used to understand the visibility of the transient patterns.

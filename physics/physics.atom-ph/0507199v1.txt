The electric quadrupole moment for the 4d 2D5/2 state of 88Sr+, one of the most important
candidates for an optical clock, has been calculated using the relativistic coupled-cluster theory. The
result of the calculation is presented and the important many-body contributions are highlighted.
The calculated electric quadrupole moment is (2.94 ± 0.07)ea2
0, where a0 is the Bohr radius and e
the electronic charge while the measured value is (2.6 ± 0.3)ea2
0. This is so far the most accurate
determination of the electric quadrupole moment for the above mentioned state.

The frequencies at which atoms emit or absorb electro-
magnetic radiation during a transition can be used for
deﬁning the basic unit of time [1, 2, 3]. The transi-
tions that are extremely stable, accurately measurable
and reproducible can serve as excellent frequency stan-
dards [1, 2]. The current frequency standard is based on
the ground state hyperﬁne transition in 133Cs which is
in the microwave regime and has an uncertainty of one
part in 1015 [4]. However, demands from several areas of
science and technology have lead to a worldwide search
[5] for even more accurate clocks in the optical regime.
The uncertainty of these clocks is expected to be about
1 part in 1017 or 1018 [5]. Some of the prominent candi-
dates that belong to this category are 199Hg+ [6], 88Sr+
[7, 8], 171Yb+ [9] etc. Indeed detailed studies on these
ions will have to be carried out in order to determine
their suitability for optical frequency standards.
In a
recent article [10] Gill and Margolis have discussed the
merits of choosing 88Sr+ as a candidate for an optical
clock. Till recently, the most accurate measurement of
an optical frequency was for the clock transition in 88Sr+
which has an uncertainty of 3.4 parts in 1015 [11]. How-
ever, recently, Oskay et al. [12] have measured the optical
frequency of 199Hg+ to an accuracy of 1.5 parts in 1015
and further improvements are expected [13].

When an atom interacts with an external ﬁeld, the
standard frequency may be shifted from the resonant fre-
quency [14]. The quality of the frequency standard de-
pends upon the accurate and precise measurement of this
shift. To minimize or maintain any shift of the clock fre-
quency, the interaction of the atom with it’s surroundings
must be controlled. Hence, it is important to have a good
knowledge of these shifts so as to minimize them while
setting up the frequency standard. Some of these shifts
are the linear Zeeman shift, quadratic Zeeman shift,
second-order Stark shift and electric quadrupole shift due
to the interaction of atomic electric quadrupole moment
with the gradient of electric ﬁeld [14]. The largest source
of uncertainty in frequency shift arises from the electric
quadrupole shift of the clock transition. The electric

quadrupole moments of 88Sr+, 199Hg+ and 171Yb+ have
been measured in order to determine this shift. However,
accurate measurements of these shifts are very diﬃcult.
The calculation of these shifts although very challenging
could in some cases be more accurate than the measure-
ments. Such calculations have received relatively less at-
tention so far. The most rigorous calculation to date has
been performed by Oskay et.al [12] for 199Hg+ using the
relativistic conﬁguration interaction (RCI) method with
a multi-conﬁguration Dirac-Fock - extended optimized
level (MCDF-EOL) orbital basis. We focus on the clock
transition 5s 2S1/2 − 4d 2D5/2 in 88Sr+ in the present
paper. Figure 1 shows the clock transition in 88Sr+.
The electric quadrupole moment in the state 4d 2D5/2
was measured experimentally by Barwood et al. at NPL
[15]. Since the ground state 5s 2S1/2 does not posses
any electric quadrupole moment, the contribution to the
quadrupole shift for the clock frequency comes only from
the 4d 2D5/2 state. In this letter, we present our rela-

FIG. 2: The diagrams (a) and (c) are subsets of dressed pair
correlation (DPC) diagrams. Diagram (b) is one of the direct
dressed core-polarization (DCP) diagram.

The ﬁrst few terms in the above expectation value
can be identiﬁed as O, OS1, OS2, S†
1OS1 etc; are re-
ferred to as dressed Dirac-Fock (DDF), dressed pair cor-
relation (DPC) (Fig.2(a)) and dressed core polarization
(DCP)(Fig.2(b)) respectively. We use the term ‘dressed’
because the operator O includes the eﬀects of the core ex-
citation operator T . Among the above, we can identify
few other terms which play crucial role in determining
the correlation eﬀects. One of those terms is S†
1OS1 + c.c
((Fig.2(c)) which is called as dressed higher order pair
correlation (DHOPC) since it directly involves the corre-
lation between a pair of electrons. In table II individual
contributions from these diagrams are listed.

The orbitals used in the present work are expanded in
terms of a ﬁnite basis set comprising of Gaussian type
orbitals (GTO) [20]

Fi,k(r) = rk exp(−αir2),

(9)

with k = 0, 1, 2 · · · for s, p, d, · · · type functions, respec-
tively. The exponents are determined by the even tem-
pering condition [21]

αi = α0βi−1.

(10)

The starting point of the computation is the generation
of the Dirac-Fock (DF) orbitals [20] which are deﬁned on
a radial grid of the form

ri = r0 [exp(i − 1)h − 1]

(11)

with the freedom of choosing the parameters r0 and h.
All DF orbitals are generated using a two parameter
Fermi nuclear distribution

ρ =

ρ0
1 + exp((r − c)/a)

,

(12)

where the parameter c is the half charge radius and a
is related to skin thickness, deﬁned as the interval of
the nuclear thickness in which the nuclear charge density
falls from near one to near zero. The interaction of the
atomic quadrupole moment with the external electric-
ﬁeld gradient is analogous to the interaction of a nuclear
quadrupole moment with the electric ﬁelds generated by
the atomic electrons inside the nucleus. In the presence

ordinate of the jth electron. To calculate the quantity
we express the quadrupole operator in its single particle
form as

(14)

and the single particle reduced matrix element is ex-
pressed as [22]

of the electric ﬁeld, this gives rise to an energy shift by
coupling with the gradient of the electric ﬁeld. Thus the
treatment of electric quadrupole moment is analogous
to the nuclear counterpart. The quadrupole moment Θ
of an atomic state |Ψ(γ, J, M )i is deﬁned as the diago-
nal matrix element of the quadrupole operator with the
maximum value MJ , given by,

Θ = hΨ(γ J J)|Θzz|Ψ(γ J J)i.

(13)

Here γ is an additional quantum number which dis-
tinguishes the initial and ﬁnal states. The electric
quadrupole operator in terms of the electronic coordi-
nates is given by,

Fock wavefunctions respectively. ji is the total angular

In table I we have presented the details of the basis
functions used in this calculation and in table II con-
tributions from diﬀerent many body terms. The value
of Θ in the 4d 2D5/2 state measured experimentally
is (2.6 ± 0.3)ea2
0 [15], where e is the electronic charge
and a0 is the Bohr radius. Our calculated value for the
4d 2D5/2 stretched state is (2.94±0.07)ea2
0. We have esti-
mated the error incurred in our present work, by taking

0 [12].

the diﬀerence between our RCC calculations with sin-
gles, doubles as well as the most important triple excita-
tions (CCSD(T)) and only single and double excitations
(CCSD). A non-relativistic Hartree-Fock (HF) determi-
nation resulted in Θ = 3.03ea2
0 [15]. A subsequent cal-
culation based on RCI with MCDF-EOL orbital basis
yielded Θ = 3.02ea2
In that calculation, correla-
tion eﬀects arising from a subset of the terms S1, T1 for
single excitations and S2 and T2 for double excitations
were considered, where S1 and S2 are the cluster oper-
ators representing single excitations from the valence 5s
orbital to a virtual orbital and double excitations from
the valence 5s and the core {4s, 4p, 3d} orbitals, with
atmost one excitation from the core, respectively. In our
calculation, in addition to these eﬀects, the eﬀects arising
from the non-linear terms like T 2
2 , T1T2, etc. have been
included. In the framework of CCSD theory, the single
and double excitations have been treated to all orders in
electron correlation including excitations from the entire
core. This amounts to a more rigorous treatment of elec-
tron correlation in comparison to the previous calculation
performed using the RCI method..

It is clear from the table II that the DDF contribu-
tion is the largest. The leading correlation contribution
comes from the DPC eﬀects and the DCP eﬀects are an
order of magnitude smaller. This can be understood from
the DPC diagram (Fig.2(a)) which has a valence electron
in the 4d5/2 state. Hence the dominant contribution to
the electric quadrupole moment arises from the overlap
between virtual d5/2 orbitals and the valence, owing to
the fact that S1 is an operator of rank 0 and the electric
quadrupole matrix elements for the valence 4d5/2 and
the diﬀuse virtual d5/2 orbitals are substantial. On the
other hand, in the DCP diagram (Fig.2(b)), the matrix

element of the same operator could also involve the less
diﬀuse s or p orbitals. Hence, for a property like the
electric quadrupole moment, whose magnitude depends

4

on the square of the radial distance from the nucleus,
this trend seems reasonable, whereas for properties like
hyperﬁne interaction which which is sensitive to the near
nuclear region, the trend is just the opposite for the d
states [23]. As expected, the contribution of the DHOPC
eﬀect i.e., S†
¯OS1 (Fig.2(c)) is relatively important as it
1
involves an electric quadrupole matrix element between
the valence 4d5/2 and a virtual d5/2 orbital. Unlike many
other properties particularly the hyperﬁne interactions,
an all-order determination of this diagram is essential for
obtaining an accurate value of the electric quadrupole
moment. One of the strengths of RCC theory is that it
can evaluate such diagrams to all orders in the residual
Coulomb interaction.

In conclusion, we have performed an ab initio calcula-
tion of the electric quadrupole moment for the 4d 2D5/2
state of 88Sr+ to an accuracy of less than 2.5 % using
the RCC theory. Evaluation of correlation eﬀects to all
orders as well as the inclusion of the dominant triple ex-
citations in our calculation was crucial in achieving this
accuracy. This is currently the most accurate determi-
nation of electric quadrupole moment for this state in
Sr+. Our result will lead to a better quantitative under-
standing of the electric quadrupole shift of the resonance
frequency of the clock transition in 88Sr+.

Four-state N-atom as a simple theoretical model for electromagnetically induced
absorption

A. V. Taichenachev, A. M. Tumaikin and V. I. Yudin
Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia
(December 23, 2013)

A simple theoretical model describing the positive sign of subnatural-width absorption resonances
in the recent experiment of Akulshin and co-workers (Phys. Rev. A, 57, 2996 (1998)) is proposed.
An analytical expression for the linear response to the weak probe ﬁeld is found in the low-saturation
limit with respect to the control ﬁeld. It is shown that the positive sign of subnatural resonance
is caused by the spontaneous transfer of the light-induced coherence from the excited level to the
ground one.

I. INTRODUCTION

As is well-known the nonlinear interference eﬀects in the resonant atom-light interaction can lead to the electro-
magnetically induced transparency (EIT) of atomic medium [1] as well as to other interesting phenomena [2]. The key
point of all these phenomena is the light-induced coherence between atomic levels, which are not coupled by dipole
transitions. Recently Akulshin and co-workers have observed subnatural-width resonances in the absorption on the
D2 line of rubidium vapor under excitation by two copropagating optical waves with variable frequency oﬀset [3].
Surprisingly, that apart from EIT-resonances with negative sign, they have detected positive resonances termed in ref.
[3] as electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA). Basing on the experimental results and numerical calculations,
authors of ref. [3] have deduced [4] that EIA occurs in a degenerate two-level system when the three conditions are
Fe is closed. iii) The ground
satisﬁed: i) The excited-state total angular momentum Fe = Fg + 1. ii) Transition Fg →
state is degenerate Fg > 0.

In the present paper, motivated by the absence of EIA-resonances in three-state Λ and V -systems, we propose a

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

Let us consider the resonant interaction of a bichromatic light ﬁeld:

E(r, t) = E1 exp[

iω1t + i(k1r)] + E2 exp[

iω2t + i(k2r)] + c.c.

and
i

are degenerate and belong to the ground level with zero energy and zero relaxation rate. The even states are also
3
|
degenerate and form the excited level with the energy ¯hω0 and relaxation rate Γ. We assume that among optical
transitions between the ground and excited levels
is forbidden due to some
i → |
selection rule (for instance, with respect to the momentum projection). Let the ﬁrst term in eq.(1) (will be refered
as a control ﬁeld) is suﬃciently larger than the second one, which is a probe ﬁeld. The control ﬁeld with the vector
amplitude E1 and frequency ω1 drives simultaneously two transitions
. The weak probe ﬁled
and

E2 at the frequency ω2 induces the
transition. In the rotating frame the Hamiltonian for the free atom
reads

The last two terms in the curly brackets in eq.(6) (proportional to Ω1) describe modiﬁcations of the absorption due
to the light-induced low-frequency coherences. It is well-known that in both Λ and V systems the coherences ρ13 and
ρ24 have such phases that the absorption of the probe ﬁeld is reduced at the two-photon resonance δ2 = δ1. We note
that these two terms in eq.(6) have opposite signs. In the case under consideration an additional term in equation
ρ13 (dρ13/dt = . . . + bAΓρ24). Hence, the phase of ρ24 giving the
for ρ13 arises from the spontaneous transfer ρ24 →
transparency through the term iΩ1ρ24 can give the icrease of absorption through the term
iAΩ1ρ13. For the sake
of clarity, in the following analyses we use two approximations: i) The ﬁrst order in the probe amplitude Ω2; and ii)
The low-saturation limit for the control ﬁeld, i.e. Ω1 < Γ. In this case instead of eq.(6) we write

The right-hand sides of eqs.(9) are the ﬁeld interference terms describing the creation of ρ(1)
24 . In the square
bracket of the ﬁrst line the ﬁeld broadening and optical shifts of the ground-level states are present. Equations (9)
are not independent due to the second terms on l.h.s. of both lines, which correspond to the spontaneous and induced
coherence transfer between levels. In the low-saturation limit the excited-level coherence ρ(1)
24 enters into the equation
for the ground-level coherence ρ(1)
13 through the term describing the spontaneous coherence transfer. As it can be
seen, this process leads to changes in the position, width and amplitude of nonlinear resonances connected with the
low-frequency coherence. Since in the present paper we are interesting in the subnatural-width resonance, the anzatz
Γ is relevant. Using eqs.(9), we can eliminate the low-frequency coherence in eq.(7) and arrive at the ﬁnal

A. Homogeneous broadening

Consider ﬁrst the case of v = 0. The steady-state zero-order populations ρ(0)

33 are governed by the
equilibrium between the excitation and relaxation processes in the absence of the probe ﬁeld. Obviously, these values
can not contain structures with the width less than Γ. Then, only the last two terms on the r.h.s. of (10) are
δ2. If δ1 = 0, the sign of the absorption
responsible for the subnatural-width resonance on the frequency oﬀset δ1 −
ρ(0)
resonance is determined by the sign of the expression (2b
11 and, consequently, depends on both the
branching ratio constant and zero-order populations. For example, in the absence of the spontaneous transfer of the
low-frequency coherence (b = 0) the resonance is always negative, that corresponds to EIT. In the opposite case of
the closed transition (b = 1) the resonance is positive if ρ(0)
11 , i.e. we have EIA (see in ﬁg.2). The position and
the width of the EIA-resonance is determined by the real and imagine parts of the linear combination of the complex
ground-level optical shifts:

It is remarkable that the coeﬃcients of this combination depend on the branching ratio b.

B. Doppler broadening

In the case of atomic gas the EIA-resonance is a sum of structures with diﬀerent amlitudes, positions, and width.
Here we consider the result of such velocity averaging in one speciﬁc case. Let the copropagating control and probe
(k2v)
ﬁelds have the approximately equal Doppler shifts (k1v)
kvz. Besides, we assume that the transition is
closed b = 1, and the zero-order populations ρ(0)
33 = fM (v) is the Maxwell distribution. The averaged
optical coherence is expressed through the error function:

IV. CONCLUSION

To conclude we note the four-state N -type interaction scheme can be easily organized in real atomic systems. For
example, let us consider a closed Fg = F
Fe = F + 1 transition of the D2 line of an alkali atom interacting
with the σ+ polarized control ﬁeld. In the steady state all atoms are completely pumped into the stretched states

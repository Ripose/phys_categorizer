Measurements of rubidium lifetime in a dark magneto-optial trap (DMOT) was performed at

various populations of the bright and dark hyper(cid:28)ne states of the trapped atoms. The rubidium

lifetime in the trap appeared to be shorter if the atom spent more time in the bright state. A

simple explanation of this e(cid:27)et is based on the inrease of the ross-setion of rubidium ollisions

with the surrounding warm atoms upon rubidium eletroni exitation.

INTRODUCTION

Laser ooling of neutral atoms in magneto-optial traps, MOT [1, 2℄ beame an impor-

tant tehnique of the modern atomi physis. MOT is a onvenient and reliable apparatus

for ooling large louds of atoms to the temperatures in the 10 - 100 µK range. The main

appliations of MOTs inlude laser spetrosopy of old atoms, old ollisions, new fre-

queny standards, (cid:28)rst stage of ooling to ahieve BEC and many others.

There are well-known di(cid:30)ulties in straitforward appliations of MOTs to the investi-

gations of old atoms. The MOTs use strong laser radiation and inhomogeneous magneti

(cid:28)eld that disturb aptured atoms. One way to solve this problem is to separate in time

the apture and investigation of old atoms. A disadvantage of this approah is that one

has to work with unstable ob jet, the atomi loud released from the trap.

In some ases the problem an be solved with the help of a speially modi(cid:28)ed MOT,

the dark magneto-optial trap (DMOT) proposed in [3℄ for alkali atoms. The DMOT

onsists of two regions. The outer region has both the trapping and repumping light and

works similar to an ordinary MOT. In the inner region the repumping light is bloked and

atoms are olleted on the "dark" hyper(cid:28)ne state noninterating with the trapping light.

Beause of the sattering of the repumping light by the optial elements and warm atoms

a low intensity repumping light is nevertheless present in the inner region of DMOT.

Consequently, some fration of the trapped atoms is situated in the "bright" hyper(cid:28)ne

state that interats with the trapping light. Note, that the atoms in the "bright" state

are responsible for the loud (cid:29)uoresene in DMOT.

Main appliation of DMOTs is for inreasing the density of trapped atoms. It ours

beause the partile repulsion indued by the radiation exhange and the rate of supere-

lasti ollisions are suppressed in DMOT. In addition to this useful ability of DMOT to

hold large fration of atoms in dark state, DMOT allows us to vary in a ontrollable way

the populations of the bright and dark states. The populations of these states determine

a number of proesses in DMOT, e.g., the laser power absorbed by old atoms. Thus

the hange of the fration of "bright" atoms in DMOT an be used to study the physis

of old atoms.

In this paper we report on an experimental observation of the lifetime

dependene of rubidium atoms in a DMOT on the relative abundane of the bright and

dark hyper(cid:28)ne states.

RUBIDIUM LEVEL SCHEME AND DMOT

Our experiment was done with

Rb atoms. The energy level diagram is presented in

85

Fig.1. The DMOT used two lasers. The trapping laser frequeny was tuned to the red

by 15 - 20 MHz from the transition Fg = 3 → Fe = 4. The frequeny of the repumping
laser was varied in a wide range in the viinity of the transitions Fg = 2 → Fe = 2, 3

(see below). The hyper(cid:28)ne states Fg = 2 and Fg = 3 are the dark and bright states,

respetively.

An experimental setup is shown in Fig.2. Our DMOT ollets atoms from surrounding

warm rubidium vapour similar to the approah suggested in the Ref. [2℄. The DMOT

uses 6 irular polarized trapping beams and 2 linear polarized repumping beams all

having diameter of approximately 15 mm and intensity 6 mW. The hollow repumping

beams (inner diameter equal 5 mm) were direted to the trap enter at 90

to eah other.

0

The trapping and repumping beams were produed by the two ommerial lasers DL100

Quadrupole magneti (cid:28)eld was reated by two Helmholtz oils having 100 turns eah,

diameter equal 5 m and separated by 5 m. The oils produed in the trap enter the

magneti (cid:28)eld gradient equal 17 G/m along the symmetry axis at the urrent through

the oils equal 1.6 A. The quadrupole magneti (cid:28)eld ould be swithed on and o(cid:27) as fast

(Toptia).

as 500 µse.

We have used simple vauum hamber for DMOT that is a glass sphere of diameter

6 m without antire(cid:29)etion oating. The hamber was permanently onneted to the 5

liter/se ion pump and to the glass appendix ontaining metal rubidium. The rubidium

vapour pressure in the hamber was regulated by ooling this appendix with the help of

Peltier element. Beause the hamber was permanently pumped by the ion pump the

rubidium vapour pressure was signi(cid:28)antly lower than the saturated vapour pressure for

a given appendix temperature. The pressure of residual gases in the hamber was on the

order of 10

Torr.

−8

The rubidium populations in the ground hyper(cid:28)ne states were measured in the exper-

iment with the help of an additional probe beam that was produed by the free running

(without an external resonator) home-made diode laser equipped with good quality ur-

rent and temperature stabilizers. The diode ML6XX24 (Mitsubishi) was used in this laser.

The linewidth of the probe radiation was estimated being less than 1 MHz (HWHM).

3

All three lasers used in the present experiment were equipped with the home-made

frequeny stabilization systems based on the DAVLL (dihroi atomi vapour laser lok)

priniple [4, 5℄. This stabilization system allowed us to stabilize the radiation frequeny

at any point in a wide range (

1 GHz) near eah hyper(cid:28)ne Rb absorption lines. The

≃

system provided a good frequeny stability with the laser frequeny drift being less than

3 MHz/hour. More details on our stabilization system an be found in [6℄.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The steady-state number of aptured rubidium atoms depends on the density of sur-

rounding warm rubidium atoms. If the appendix ontaining metal rubidium was kept at

room temperature, the total number of aptured rubidium atoms in our DMOT exeeded

. The loud had almost spherial shape with the diameter 0.8 mm. The shape of

the rubidium loud was determined from the digitized (cid:29)uoresene image reorded by the

5 · 108

CCD video amera.

The density of aptured rubidium atoms as a funtion of frequeny of repumping

radiation is presented in Fig. 3. These data were obtained with the rubidium appendix

kept at room temperature. In order to determine the value of the repumping frequeny the

saturation absorption resonanes of ounter propagating beams in an additional rubidium

ell (at room temperature) were reorded. These resonanes for the hyper(cid:28)ne transitions

Fg = 2 → Fe = 1, 2, 3 are shown in Fig. 3a. Beause there are three allowed transitions
in the absorption spetra Fg = 2 → Fe = 1, 2, 3, the saturation resonane spetrum has

six peaks. Frequeny alibration of this spetrum was performed using the tabulated

positions of the resonanes given in [7℄. For onveniene of the reader the frequenies of

the saturated resonanes are listed in Table I.

The Rb densities in the Fg = 2 state (n2) and in the Fg = 3 state (n3) at various

repumping frequenies are presented in Fig. 3b. These data were reorded at slow san

rate of the repumping frequeny in order to aount the large (cid:28)lling time of the trap.

The n3 urve has two peaks at the repumping frequenies oiniding with the transitions
Fg = 2 → Fe = 2, 3. The n2 urve has more ompliated struture. For the following we

need to onsider in the n2 urve the two positive wide peaks and the two negative narrow
peaks all entered at the repumping frequenies of Fg = 2 → Fe = 2, 3 transitions. The

positive wide peaks in the n2 and n3 urves are due to the peaks in the e(cid:30)ieny of the

4

repumping radiation in the outer region of DMOT. The narrow negative peaks in the n2

urve are due to the hyper(cid:28)ne pumping aused by the weak sattered repumping light

in the inner region of DMOT. More details of this experiment and the disussion of the

urves' features an be found in [8℄.

Let us onsider now the ratio of the rubidium densities in Fg = 3 and Fg = 2 states,

n3/n2 , as a funtion of repumping frequeny (Fig. 3). The ratio n3/n2 has two maxima
at the enters of Fg = 2 → Fe = 2, 3 transitions. The ratio n3/n2 has deep minimum
at the repumping frequeny between the Fg = 2 → Fe = 2, 3 transitions. Note that the

DMOT apture remains highly e(cid:30)ient at all these repumping frequenies. The data in

Fig. 3 shows that by tuning the repumping frequeny the ratio n3/n2 in the DMOT an

be varied from 1.5 to 0.08, thus by 20 times.

These features of our DMOT was used in the present experiment to measure the state

dependene of the rubidium lifetime in the trap. We measured the number of trapped

atoms in the Fg = 2 state as a funtion of time after swithing on the quadrupole magneti

(cid:28)eld at the three positions of repumping frequeny, ωrep :

ωrep = ω22, ωrep = ω23, ωrep = −40 MHz,

(1)

where ω22 and ω23 are the frequenies of the Fg = 2 → Fe = 2, 3 transitions, respetively.

The number of trapped atoms was measured with the help of the probe beam absorption.

The probe frequeny was tuned to the enter of the Fg = 2 → Fe = 1 transition. This

transition is a losed transition and thus experienes smaller power saturation that the

two other allowed transitions started from the state Fg = 2.

The measurements were done at rubidium appendix temperature equal -8 C. This

redued signi(cid:28)antly the rubidium pressure in the trap hamber and onsequently the

number of trapped atoms beame 10 - 20 times smaller than for rubidium appendix

being at the room temperature. The derease of the number of trapped atoms simpli(cid:28)ed

the experimental situation beause the loud appeared to be optially thin. On the other

hand, it was heked that the ratio n2/n3 undergoes the similar variations with the hange

of ωrep as in the Fig. 3 measured for the rubidium appendix at the room temperature.

The time dependenies of the number of aptured atoms are presented in Fig. 4. The

two urves ("a" and "b") orresponding to ωrep being at the enters of the Fg = 2 → Fe =
2, 3 transitions oinide ompletely with eah other. The third urve for ωrep = −40 MHz

5

shows signi(cid:28)antly longer lifetime. The measured lifetimes are,

τ22 = 0.72 ± 0.01 se; τ23 = 0.74 ± 0.01 se; τmid = 1.03 ± 0.01 se;

(2)

where indies refer to the position of the repumping frequeny. The (cid:28)lling time dependen-

ies presented in Fig. 4 appeared to be purely exponential at the experimental auray.

DISCUSSION

The lifetime of rubidium atoms in magneto-optial traps depends on many e(cid:27)ets (see,

e.g., the review [9℄). One an neglet some of these e(cid:27)ets at low density of aptured

atoms hosen in this experiment for the rubidium lifetime measurements. The fat that

our (cid:28)lling urves were purely exponential supports the neglet of the reabsorption of

rubidium (cid:29)uoresene and superelasti ollisions inside the loud. In this simpli(cid:28)ed ase,

the number of trapped atoms, N , is governed by the following equation [2℄,

dN
dt

= R − Nγ,

(3)

(4)

where, R is the trap apture rate of rubidium atoms and γ is the esape rate of rubidium

atoms from the trap. The rate γ is determined by the ollisions with the surrounding

warm atoms,

γ = nRbσRbvRb + nbσbvb,

where nRb , nb , are the onentrations of warm rubidium atoms and residual gases, vRb ,

vb are their veloities. The ross-setions, σRb and σb , haraterize the ollisions that

aelerate old atoms to the veloity larger than the ritial veloity, vc . Critial veloity

is the maximum veloity of Rb atoms that trap is able to apture [2℄.

The model of Eq. (3) gives the exponential time dependene for the number of aptured

atoms with the time onstant equal γ−1

. The observed in our experiment hange in the

rubidium lifetime at various repumping frequenies an be understood if one suggests that

the ross-setions σRb and σb depend on the eletroni state of old rubidium atom. Note

that the times spent in the ground and in the eletronially exited states of the trapped

rubidium atoms di(cid:27)er signi(cid:28)antly for the repumping frequenies equal ω22 , or ω23 and

ωmid hosen in this experiment. The measurements made above show that there are 60%

of Rb atoms in the bright hyper(cid:28)ne state if ωrep equals to ω22 , or ω23 , and only 10% if
ωrep = −40 MHz. Rb atoms in the bright state spend approximately half of their time in

6

the exited state. Consequently, the fration of the eletronially exited Rb atoms equals

≃

30% if ωrep = ω22 , or ω23 and

≃

5% if ωrep = −40 MHz. One an estimate that suh

variation of eletronially exited Rb atoms an explain the hange of lifetime given by

Eq.(2) if an eletronially exited Rb atom has its "esape" ross-setion 3 times larger

than an unexited atom.

The state dependene of the rubidium ross-setions is the fat well established in the

experiments devoted to the rubidium light-indued drift (LID) e(cid:27)et [10℄. It was measured

in Ref. [10℄ that the hange in the rubidium transport ross-setion an be as as large

as 50%. Note also, that the losses in magneto-optial traps are dependent on similar

but not idential ross-setions. The LID e(cid:27)et depends on the transport ross-setion

hange upon atom exitation, but the trap losses are dependent on the ross-setion of

the transfer to the old atom a small amount of kineti energy su(cid:30)ient for the atom to

esape from the trap. This "esape" energy is by 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than

the kBT at room temperature.

CONCLUSIONS

We have measured the rubidium lifetime in the dark magneto-optial trap (DMOT)

at the relative populations of the bright and dark hyper(cid:28)ne states di(cid:27)erent by fator 20.

The measurements showed that the rubidium lifetime in DMOT beame shorter when it

spent more time in the bright state. The possible explanation of this e(cid:27)et an be based

on the assumption that the ross-setion of trapped rubidium atoms with surrounding

warm atoms is larger for the eletronially exited rubidium than for rubidium in the

ground state. Similar trend was observed previously for the transport ross-setion of

eletronially exited rubidium atoms in the investigations of the light-indued drift e(cid:27)et

(LID) [10℄.

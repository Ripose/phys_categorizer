Electron-positron pairs’ generation occuring in the interaction of 1018–1020 W/cm2 laer radiation
with high-Z targets are examined. Computational results are presented for the pair production and
the positron yield from the target with allowance for the contribution of pair production processes
due to electrons and bremsstrahlung photons. Monte-Carlo simulations using the prizma code
conﬁrm the estimates obtained. The possible positron yield from high-Z targets irradiated by
picosecond lasers of power 102–103 TW is estimated to be 109–1011.

The possibility of electron-positron pair production by relativistic electrons accelerated by a laser ﬁeld has been
discussed since many years [1].It was estimated that the positron production eﬃciency can be high [2]. The papers
cited considered the case of pair production during oscillations of electrons in an electromagnetic wave in the focal
region of laser radiation. Here we examine a somewhat diﬀerent pair production scenario.

The interaction of high-power laser radiation with matter results in the production of fast, high-temperature
electrons [3]. Relativistic temperatures of fast electrons Tf ≈ 1 MeV have been observed in experiments with powerful
picosecond lasers [4]. Self-consistent electric ﬁelds conﬁne these electrons in the target. When the electrons interact
with the matter in a high-Z target, electron-positron pairs are produced [5]. The annihilation photon spectrum can
be used for diagnostics of the electron-positron plasma.

In the present letter we make estimates of the positron and photon yield as function of the laser power. We have
made an assessment of the possibility of using high-power (102–103 TW) ultrashort-pulse lasers to produce a high-
luminosity positron source. Such sources are required for the production of slow (1–10 eV) positrons with an intensity
of 108 positrons per second. Such positrons ﬁnd wide applications for the study of Fermi surfaces, defects and surfaces
of various materials [6].

The interaction of relativistic electrons with matter can lead to electron-positron pair production in the following

two processes:

e− + Z → 2e− + e+ + Z;
(i)
(ii) e− + Z → e + γ + Z → 2e− + e+ + Z.

In Ref. [7] analytical and numerical calculations of the total cross section of the pair electroproduction process are
performed using the diﬀerential cross section of Ref. [8]. According to this work the total cross section of the process
(i) near the threshold equals

Let us examine the contribution of the process (i) to the electron-positron pair production in matter. Let us
assume that the fast electrons produced when the high-intensity laser radiation interacts with matter are conﬁned by
self-consistent electric ﬁelds, so that electron moderation in the target can be treated just as in inﬁnite media.

Taking the Rohrlich-Carlsson formula [10] for dE/dx, we carried out a numerical computation of the integral in
Eq. (5) for the case of lead. Averaging we(E) over the relativistic Maxwell distribution with temperature T , we
obtained the number of positrons produced relative to one initial electron versus temperature. This dependence is
shown in Fig. 2. Performing the same averaging with weight < E+ > from (4), we obtained the average energy of the
positrons produced.

The average positron energy determines the required thickness of the target, since the mean free path in matter

depends upon energy. For lead this dependence is determined by [11]

Let’s estimate the probability of pair production by bremsstrahlung photons (process (ii)).

In contrast to the
electrons conﬁned in the target by the self-consistent electric ﬁeld, photons can escape from it. The cross section

where σatot(ε) = σγ→e+e− (ε) + σaincoh(ε), wa(ε) = 1 − exp(−σatot(ε)ni∆), ∆ is the thickness of the target. For an
inﬁnite target

We take the photon spectrum in the form

dN/dε ≃ ǫe→eγ T

−1 exp(−ε/T ),

where ǫe→eγ = 3 × 10−4ZT /mc2 is the ratio of the total bremsstrahlung power radiated to the total power in the
incident electron beam determined in Sec. (IV-20) of Ref. [12]. Averaging wγ(∆, ε) over spectrum (9), we obtain

wγ(∆, T ) ≃ ǫe→eγ T

The results of the estimation of the number of positrons produced can be used to estimate the number of annihilation
photons in targets with thickness greater than the positrons mean free path (see Fig. 3) but less than that of photons
(≈ 6 g cm−2 for lead). The channel (ii) predominates here. For thickness about 2–3 g cm−2 the photon yield reaches
0.04% per one source electron with temperature T ≃ 1 MeV.

To check the estimates, calculations were performed using the prizma code [13], which simulates all basic electron,
photon and positron transport and production processes for any geometry (one-, two- and three-dimensional) by the
Monte Carlo method. The calculation were perfomed for a lead sphere with radius R = 0.2 cm and an electron source

with temperature T = 1 and T = 2 MeV at the center. The results are presented in Figs. 2,4. They are in good
agreement with our estimates.

According to Ref. [3], the temperature of fast electrons arising during interaction of laser radiation with matter is

about

Tf ≃ mc2

(cid:2)

where q18 is the laser power density in 1018 W cm−2. When a laser pulse with energy El[J], duration τ [psec] is
focused into a circle of diameter df [µm], the intensity equals q18 = 400 El/πd2
f τ . The number of electrons produced
is determined by Ne = Af El/hEf i, where Af is the eﬃciency of laser energy conversion to fast electrons, hEf i is the
average energy of fast electrons.

As a target we propose a sphere with conical cavity into which laser radiation is focused [14]. Such a target gives
Af ≈ 0.3, high luminosity and isotropic yield of photons and positrons from the surface. The target must have high
Z, and its optimal diameter is determined by experiment tasks and laser power.

FIG. 5. Dependence of photon (1) and positron (2) yield N/Af τ on laser power. Curve (3) shows the optimum size of a

target for a positron source.

To detect annihilation photons the target has to be of size ρR ≈ 2–3 g cm−2. The dependence of annihilation
photon yield Nγ divided by Af and τ , on laser power is shown in Fig. 5. The focal spot is df = 30 µm. The photon
yield is about of 1010–1012 for a power 102–103 TW picosecond laser.

The positron yield from the target can be estimated as

Here ∆e+,γ are the positron and bremsstrahlung photon mean free paths. The target for positron production must be
of order ∆e+ in size (see Fig. 3). The dependence of positron yield N+ divided by Af and τ , on laser power is shown
in Fig. 5. The dotted line in this ﬁgure shows the optimal target size ρ∆ for such an experiment. The positron yield
reaches 109–1011 for powers 102–103 TW picosecond laser.

Since the target could be smaller than existing positron sources, the laser positron source can have a very high
brightness. The eﬃciency of conversion of fast positrons (MeV) to slow (1–10 eV) can be as high as 10−2 [15].
Therefore, to produce a quasi steady-state source of slow positrons with an intensity of 108 positrons per second
requires a laser with energy of 10–30 J in 10–30 fs pulse with a repetition frequency 10-30 Hz. Undoubtedly, such
a source would be usefull for fundamental and applied researches in solid state physics, electronics, chemistry and
biology.

We consider non-relativistic systems in quantum mechanics interacting through
the Coulomb potential, and discuss the existence of bound states which are stable
against spontaneous dissociation into smaller atoms or ions. We review the studies
that have been made of speciﬁc mass conﬁgurations and also the properties of the
domain of stability in the space of masses or inverse masses. These rigorous results
are supplemented by numerical investigations using accurate variational methods. A
section is devoted to systems of three arbitrary charges and another to molecules in
a world with two space-dimensions.

INTRODUCTION

In classical mechanics, determining the motion of three bodies which attract each other
according to Newton’s universal law of gravitation is the most celebrated of all dynamical
problems (see, for example, [1], [2]). Over the period since 1750, it has attracted the attention
of some of the greatest mathematicians and, in particular, Euler, Lagrange, Jacobi, Poincar´e
and Levi-Civita. It cannot be solved exactly. However, recently the advent of high-speed
computers has opened up a whole new approach to the problem by making possible step-
by-step numerical integration of the diﬀerential equations of motion from the initial time
to any desired later time. The quantum three-body problem also has a rather well-known
history, in particular for systems governed by Coulomb forces. Some contributions will be
reviewed in this article.

Suppose we have a quantum system made up of three particles, two having the same
charge and the third having a charge of the same magnitude but of opposite sign, interacting
only through Coulombic forces. According to non-relativistic quantum mechanics, such a
system may, or may not, form bound states, depending on the relative masses of the particles.
For instance H+
2 (p, p, e−), Ps−(e+, e−, e−) or H−(p, e−, e−) are stable, while (p, e+, e−) or
(p, ¯p, e−) are not. The critical values of the relative masses at which bound states appear
have not been established. However, we shall describe in this article some of the interesting
and often ingenious methods which have been devised to obtain bounds on the number of
bound states of a given system and also on the critical mass ratios at which such states
appear. Our aim is also to describe the properties of the stability domain as a function of
the masses or inverse masses of the particles involved.

We then extend our study in several ways. First we consider three-body systems with
arbitrary charges. There are sets of charges for which stability is obvious, i.e., is achieved
whatever values are assumed for the masses. On the other hand, there are more interesting
situations, where stability requires very large values of certain mass ratios.

Another ﬁeld deals with systems containing more than three unit charges. In the case
of four charges, whose best known prototype is the hydrogen molecule (p, p, e−, e−), we
discuss for which masses there exists at least one bound state stable against spontaneous
dissociation.

The sections which follow will be devoted to systems with ﬁve, six or more unit charges.
Here, the boson or fermion character has to be speciﬁed when dealing with more than two
identical particles.

We will also repeat some of the studies with only d = 2 space dimensions. In the one-
body case, (or for two self- interacting particles), the situation is dramatically diﬀerent for
2 and d > 2 since in the former case, any attractive potential, however weak, will
d
produce a bound state. One expects also qualitative changes for more complex systems.
Some conclusions, and a list of unsolved problems will be included in the last section.

≤

Some useful results on Schr¨odinger operators, an introduction to methods for solving the
few-body problems, in particular to the Born–Oppenheimer approximation and variational
calculations, and a recollection of elementary calculations used historically to establish the
stability of 3- and 4-body systems, are given in Appendixes.

This review contains both a summary of rigorous results and a survey of accurate numer-
ical methods. The knowledge of precise binding energies of few-charge systems is extremely
useful in comparing the eﬃciency and accuracy of various quantum mechanical methods.
It also helps development of new methods and the improvement of those already in exis-

tence, as well as the understanding of electron–electron, electron–positron or electron–lepton
correlations and dynamics.

The investigation of the stability of few-charge systems is not only a very good test-
ing ground for diﬀerent models and methods but it also leads to important applications.
The study of stability provides very useful information for various physical systems, e.g.,
positronic atoms [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], antimatter compounds [8], systems of atoms and antiatoms
[9, 10], or charged excitons (system of electrons and holes) in semiconductors [11]. New
experimental investigations [11] of the ﬁne structure of charged excitons in semiconductor
quantum dots have shown the existence of bound states of three electrons and a positive
charge or four electrons plus two-positive charges. The stability studies presented in this pa-
per clearly show that such systems are not stable if only the pairwise Coulomb (or Coulomb
like) interaction is included and their existence is therefore due to some other binding mech-
anism, e.g., conﬁnement. There is also an interesting analogy between multiquark systems
in hadron physics, and small exotic molecules: the property of ﬂavour independence states
that the same potential applies to quarks of diﬀerent masses, in the same way that the same
Coulomb interaction is felt by electrons, muons or antiprotons. For such systems, similar
patterns are observed for conﬁgurations leading to maximal stability against spontaneous
dissociation [12].

In the preparation of this review article, it has been necessary to read hundreds of papers.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to discuss or even list all the contributions that have been
made to the subject of few-charge systems in quantum mechanics. For example, there
are more than twenty papers dealing with the binding energy and static properties of the
positronium ion, with considerable overlap between them. In each section, the key pioneering
papers are mentioned as well as a wide range of more recent contributions which should make
it possible for the reader to explore the parts of the literature that are not referred to. We
apologise in advance to any author of a signiﬁcant contribution that has inadvertently been
omitted.

II. STABILITY CRITERIA

As we are considering self-interacting, translation-invariant Hamiltonians in this review,
we shall assume that the centre-of-mass motion is removed (see Appendix A), leading to the
“interaction Hamiltonian” ˆHint. In the case of three unit charges (m+
3 ), one can
assume m2 ≤

m3. Then, in simpliﬁed units,

1 , m−

,

the ground-state energy of the hydrogen atom-like system made up of particles 1 and 3, can
be shown to be the lowest continuum threshold of ˆHint. For systems with more than three
charges, there is always such a threshold at which the system separates into two or more
smaller neutral or charged systems made up of one or more particles.

Any eigenfunction with energy below this threshold will be square-integrable and thus

correspond to a bound state [13].

This behaviour will be called genuine stability or simply, stability. Of course, it is suﬃcient
to establish that some upper bound, as given for instance by the Rayleigh–Ritz variational
method (see Appendix A), lies below Eth. However, if it cannot be established using the
Rayleigh–Ritz method that an upper bound exists that is below Eth, this does not necessarily
mean that the state under consideration is not bound. It may be that the nature of the
variational trial function makes it impossible to obtain a suﬃciently good upper bound.
One possible way of showing that a state is not bound, when the Rayleigh–Ritz method is
inconclusive, is to obtain a lower bound to the energy of the state and show that this is
above Eth (see Appendix A, Section A 3).

Except in a few cases, we shall not consider the possibility of bound states in the contin-
uum. The existence of such states is conceivable but they are rather pathological and are
expected to be unstable under perturbations [14].

Forms of stability weaker than genuine stability can also occur.
1. Imagine two heavy nuclei or particles surrounded by electrons. The particles behave
almost classically in the Born–Oppenheimer potential V (r). If V (r) has a local minimum at
internuclear distance r = r0, classical particles with suﬃciently small kinetic energy would
remain in the vicinity of this minimum, even if its value V (r0) lies above the dissociation
energy. We shall call this behaviour classical stability.

2. Imagine a 3-body state (a+, b−, c−) with angular momentum and parity J P = 1+,

this not including intrinsic spins and parities. Then the decay

(a+, b−, c−)

(a+, b−)1s + c− ,

→

cannot take place if the atom in the ﬁnal state is in its 1s ground-state with angular mo-
mentum and parity jp = 0+. The decay requires higher states, for instance 2p. This means
that the threshold is higher, as long as radiative corrections are neglected. Otherwise, the
reaction

would have to be considered. We shall call this behaviour metastability.

III. PARTICULAR THREE-UNIT-CHARGE SYSTEMS

In this section, we present the methods applied to examine the stability of three unit-
charge systems, and discuss in some details conﬁgurations which have been extensively
studied. The next sections will be devoted to global studies of the stability region in the
parameter space.

A. Notation

We consider systems with one charge, q1, of mass m1, and two charges opposite to q1,
q1, with masses m2 and m3, respectively. By charge conjugation invariance,
say q2 = q3 =
it does not matter whether q1 > 0 and q2 = q3 < 0 or vice-versa. By scaling, one can take
q1 =

q2 =

q3 = 1.

µ2 =

where µ1, for example, is the reduced mass of particles 1 and 3.

ˆHint represents the motion of two particles (more properly, pseudo-particles) of mass µ1
and µ2, respectively. It diﬀers from the usual form for the Hamiltonian for two particles
as it contains a coupling term between the momenta of the particles. This is known as the
Hughes–Eckart or mass-polarisation term [15, 16, 17].

If m3 is very much larger than m1 and m2, the eﬀects introduced by locating the origin
at particle 3 are very small. For this reason, they are normally neglected in the analogous
many-body problem of an n-electron atom.

The mass-polarisation term can be eliminated by using Jacobi coordinates, ﬁrst intro-
duced by Jacobi and Lagrange, in the context of the three-body problem in Newtonian
mechanics [2]. If we transform to new internal coordinates, (see Appendix A).

Note that though x = r1,

partial diﬀerentiation. As seen in Appendix A, using Jacobi coordinates simpliﬁes the kinetic
energy part of ˆHint at the expense of making the potential energy part more complicated.

B. H+
2

The hydrogen molecular ion, H+

2 , belongs to a special category of three-body systems that
contain two identical particles and a third particle with charge of equal but opposite sign.
Using the comparison theorem, see Appendix A, Hill [20] was able to prove that systems
of this type always have at least one bound state. He was able to show further that these
systems have only one bound state if mi/md < 0.210101636, where mi is the mass of the
identical particles and md is the mass of the remaining particle.

In the case of H+

2 , where the two identical particles are protons and the remaining particle
an electron, mi/md = 1836.2. Thus this system is far outside the region in which it can be
shown that only one bound state exists. As might be expected, it can be shown that this
system has many bound states.

The large diﬀerence in mass between the protons and the electron means that the Born–
Oppenheimer approximation (Appendix C) gives accurate results when applied to this sys-
tem. In this approximation, the nuclei are ﬁxed and the energy of the electron is calculated
as a function of the internuclear distance, R. The energy of the system is then obtained by
calculating the energy of the nuclei moving in a potential made up of the electronic energy
and the internuclear potential.

The Hamiltonian for the electron moving in the ﬁeld of the ﬁxed nuclei is

where me is the mass of the electron and rA and rB are the distance of the electron from

charge on the proton. In terms of prolate spheroidal (confocal elliptical) coordinates λ, µ,
φ (see, for example, [21]), the potential, V , in this Hamiltonian is of the form

and φ is the azimuthal angle with respect to Cartesian coordinates with origin at the mid-
point of the internuclear axis and z-axis directed along this axis.

Calculations of bound-state energies for H+

As is well known [22, 23], the Schr¨odinger equation with this Hamiltonian is separable
in terms of prolate spheroidal coordinates. Details of papers describing how the resulting
ordinary diﬀerential equations can be solved to give physically acceptable solutions are listed
on page 2 of Ref. [21]. Details of square-integrable wave functions and energies are given by
Bates et al. [24]. More accurate results for the ground-state energy have been obtained by
Wind [25] and Peek [26]. For a review of calculations of this type, see Bates and Reid [27].
2 and the very closely related system HD+,
that include corrections to the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, have been carried out
by Beckel et al. [28], Wolniewicz and Poll [29], Wolniewicz and Orlikowski [30], Moss [31],
Taylor et al. [32], Korobov [33], Hilico et al. [34] and Frolov [35]. The results of Wolniewicz
and Poll’s calculations for HD+ are compared with experiment by Carrington and Kennedy
[36], who also include a detailed discussion of the underlying theory and an extensive list
of references to earlier work on HD+. Theory and experiment are in agreement that there
are a large number of bound states for these systems. The bound states are classiﬁed using
a vibrational quantum number, v, and a rotational quantum number, J. See, for example,
Bransden and Joachain [17]. v may have a value as high as v = 19 for H+
2 and v = 21 for
HD+. In general, each value of v is associated with a number of values of J, starting with
J = 0.

Recently, Carbonell et al. [37] found a new state of H+

2 , with J = 0, but with an antisym-
metric coordinate-space wave-function for the two protons. The binding energy is extremely
small, of the order of 10−9 a.u. This state has been discovered by studying how the a+H
scattering length evolves as a function of the mass of the projectile a+. The case of H+
2
corresponds to a being a proton. The scattering equations at zero energy are solved in the
conﬁguration-space Faddeev formalism. The energy of the new state of H+
2 was conﬁrmed
by a very accurate variational calculation.

(p, e−, µ+) and (µ+, e−, µ+) are systems similar to H+

2 but with one or both protons re-
placed by a positively charged muon. The mass of the muon is 206.8 me. This is much less
than the mass of the proton, but suﬃciently greater than me that the Born–Oppenheimer
approximation gives accurate energy values when applied to these systems. In this approx-
imation, the internal energy of (p, e−, µ+) or (µ+, e−, µ+) is obtained by calculating the
energy levels of a pseudo-particle with mass equal to the reduced mass of (p, µ+) or (µ+, µ+)
moving in the same electronic and Coulombic internuclear potential as in the case of H+
2
and HD+ (see Appendix C). The reduced masses of (p, µ+) and (µ+, µ+) are 185.9 me and
103.4 me, respectively. These values are much less than 918.1 me, the reduced mass of (p,p).
It follows from this that these systems do have bound states but substantially fewer than
in the case of H+
2 . See, for example, Bransden and Joachain [17]. For a non-adiabatic cal-
culation of (µ+, e−, µ+), see, e.g., [38], and for the asymmetric (p, e−, µ+), (d, e−, µ+) and
(t, e−, µ+) systems, [39].

C. H−

H− contains two electrons and a proton and is thus another example of a three-body
system that contains two identical particles of unit charge and a third particle with equal
but opposite charge. In this case, mi/md = 0.00054. It follows from the result of Hill [20]
referred to earlier that only one bound state of this system exists. This is the singlet ground

Particular three-unit charge systems

11

state.

It has been known from early on in the development of quantum mechanics that the singlet
ground state is bound. See Appendix D. Variational upper bounds of suﬃcient accuracy
to demonstrate this were obtained by Bethe [40], Hylleraas [41] and Chandrasekhar [42].
Very accurate upper bounds for the energy of this state have been obtained by Pekeris [43],
Frolov and Yeremin [44], Cox et al. [45] and Drake et al.[46].

There exist a number of autodetaching or autoionising states of H− below the continuum
thresholds corresponding to excited states of the H atom. See Massey [47], Bhatia and
In particular, there is a triplet Po state below the n = 2
Temkin [48] and Bhatia [49].
continuum threshold. This is not a bound state as it is embedded in the n = 1 continuum; it
has a small but non-zero width indicating that autoionisation can occur through interaction
with states in this continuum.

There is also a triplet Pe state with energy 0.0095 eV below this threshold. See Bhatia
[50] and Drake [51]. In this case autoionisation is forbidden if spin-orbit coupling is neglected
as in this review article. This is because the n = 1 continuum does not contain any states of
the required angular momentum and parity for this process to occur. This triplet Pe state
is often described as a bound state. See, for example, Drake [51] and Ho [52]. However,
it should more properly be called a metastable state as it does not satisfy the criterion for
stability speciﬁed in Sec. II of this review, namely that its energy must be below the energy
of the lowest continuum threshold of the system. This is also the criterion used by Hill [20].
There is some confusion over this point in the review article on the stability of three-body
atomic and molecular ions by Armour and Byers Brown [53].

Mu− is a similar system containing a positively charged muon and two electrons. The
mass of the muon is 206.8 me. Thus in this case mi/md = 0.0048 and the system, like H−,
can only have one bound state. Mu− has been observed by, for example, Kuang et al. [54].
Its ground-state energy has been calculated by, for example, Bhatia and Drachman [55],
Petelenz and Smith [56] and Frolov and Yeremin [57].

For a review on two-electron atoms and ions, including H− and its role in astrophysics,

see [16, 58, 59].

D. Ps−

Ps−, i.e., (e−, e+, e−), is a system that contains two identical particles, in this case elec-
trons, and a third particle, a positron of the same mass and equal but opposite charge. It is
thus the special case of the systems considered earlier for which mi/md = 1. It follows from
the result of Hill [20] that this system must have at least one bound state. The existence
of a bound state of this system was predicted by Wheeler [60] and shown to be the case by
Hylleraas [61]. It was ﬁrst observed experimentally by Mills [62].

The positron is the antiparticle corresponding to the electron. As ﬁrst shown by Dirac
[63], it can annihilate with an electron to form gamma rays. The rate of this annihilation
process for Ps− was ﬁrst measured by Mills [64].

Details of calculations carried out on Ps− are given by Ho [52] and Cox et al. [65]. See,
also, Patil [66]. Very accurate calculations have been carried out for the ground state of
Ps− by Bhatia and Drachman [67], Ho [68, 69], Frolov [44, 70, 71], Petelenz and Smith [56],
Frolov and Yeremin [57], Cox et al. [65], Krivec et al. [72] and Drake et al. [46].

for Ps− have been unsuccessful. See Mills [73] and Ho [52].

Bhatia and Drachman [67] have examined the behaviour of the energy of the triplet Pe
state as md/mi is varied. They show that this energy is below the energy of the n = 2
continuum if md/mi > 16.1 or md/mi < 0.4047. This agrees with the ﬁndings described
earlier for H− and shows that the energy of this state of Mu− must be below the energy of
the n = 2 continuum. Note that md/mi = 1 for Ps−.

(p, e−, e+)

(p, e−, e+), an H atom and a positron, is an interesting case for which the variational
method fails. Inokuti et al. [74] were able to show by this method that if the mass of the
7.8 me would form a bound state
proton is taken to be inﬁnite, a “positron” with mass
with an H atom. Frost et al. [75] reduced this upper bound to 2.625 me by using a more
ﬂexible trial function. It was reduced still further to 2.20 me by Rotenberg and Stein [76].
They made their trial function even more ﬂexible by including basis functions suitable for
representing a weakly bound positron in a potential, V (r), with the appropriate asymptotic
form for an H atom and a positron [17, 77],

where α is the dipole polarisability of the H atom and r is the distance of the positron from
the proton.

The method described at the end of the section in Appendix A on the comparison theorem
was used by Spruch [78] to devise a method for showing that no bound state of the e+H
system exists if the mass of the proton is taken to be inﬁnite.

If we take particle 1 to be the positron and particle 2 to be the electron, ˆHint can be

the origin and the other at r1. As discussed in the Section above on H+
Hamiltonian which determines the electronic potential energy of the H+
2 ion in the Born–
Oppenheimer approximation. The associated Schr¨odinger equation is separable in prolate
spheroidal coordinates. The eigenvalues of ˆHe are functions only of r1 and the separability
of the Schr¨odinger equation makes it possible to calculate them to high accuracy [24, 25].

is calculated by ﬁxing r1, then calculating the ground-state energy of the electron in the
resulting two-centre attractive Coulombic potential.

It is easy to show that ˆH1 = ˆHad and ˆH2 = ˆHint, where ˆHad and ˆHint are as given above,
satisfy the required conditions for the comparison theorem and have the same continuum
threshold. Hence if no bound state of ˆHad exists no bound state of ˆHint exists. It is usual to
adjust the potential in an essentially one particle Hamiltonian such as ˆHad so that it tends
to zero as r1 tends to inﬁnity. Thus the problem of showing that ˆHad and hence ˆHint have
no bound states reduces to the problem of showing that the potential, V (r), cannot support
a bound state, where

V (r) is a central potential, i.e., it is spherically symmetric. Though it depends on the
single radial variable, r, it is a potential in three dimensions. This is very important. Any
attractive well potential can bind a particle in one dimension (see, for example, Landau
and Lifshitz [79]) but in three dimensions it has to exceed a critical strength to produce
binding (see, for example, Dyson on p. 1225 of [80], Wu and Ohmura [81], and Sec. A 10 of
Appendix).

Ways of calculating the number of bound states which V (r) can support have been

This is usually referred to as the Bargmann–Schwinger result [78]. Also important informa-
tion about the number of bound states can be obtained by an analysis of the phase shift of
particles of mass m scattered by V (r) (see, for example, Ref. [84]).

The exact number of bound states of the system for a given l value can be obtained by
determining the number of zeros (other than at r = 0) in the regular solution to the radial
Schr¨odinger equation with potential V (r) and energy E = 0 [82]. This is usually done by
step-by-step numerical integration on a computer.

Unfortunately, Gertler et al. [85] found that when m is the mass of the positron, V (r) as
given in Eq. (3.16) could support one bound state. Thus their attempt to prove that e+H
has no bound states failed.

Fortunately, Aronson et al. [86] were able to get round this diﬃculty. It is reasonable to
assume that the ground state of (e+, H) will be an s state. For such a state, in the inﬁnite
proton mass approximation ˆHint is of the form,

Aronson et al. [86] showed that it is extremely unlikely that V ′(r) can support a bound state
and hence it is highly probable that no bound state of (e+, H) exists. This result is supported
by information from scattering calculations [84, 87]. Aronson et al. showed further that it
is highly probable that no bound state of e+H exists for m1 < 1.46 me and m2 = me.

However, Aronson et al. [86] were unable to establish their conclusion rigorously. Ar-
mour [88] made their method of proof rigorous. He ﬁrst of all calculated a very accurate
wavefunction for the system described by ˆH ′
e using the variational method and basis func-
tions in terms of prolate spheroidal coordinates. He was able to calculate a good lower
bound to V ′(r) using this wavefunction and the method of Temple and Kato (see, for in-
stance, Ref. [89]) and show that this lowest bound, and hence V ′(r), could not support a
bound state. In a later paper, Armour and Schrader [90] showed that if m1 = 1.51 me and
m2 = me, no bound state of the e+H(e+, e−, p∞) system exists. To date this is the best
lower bound on the critical positron mass required for binding.

Particular three-unit charge systems

15

(3.29)

So far we have assumed that the mass, m3, of the proton in the (e+, H) system is inﬁnite.

Suppose we choose units in this case so that particle 2 has unit mass. Then

ˆHint =

where ¯m1 = m1/m2. We can see from this that it is the ratio m1/rm2 which determines
whether or not a bound state exists.
It follows that Armour’s result [88] for the case
m1 = m2 = me shows that this Hamiltonian has no bound state for m1 = m2, whatever the
value of m2.

It follows from this that if the system is to have a bound state when m3 is ﬁnite and thus

this must be due to the presence of the mass-polarisation term. As pointed out earlier,
(e−, e+, e−), and hence (e+, e−, e+), is known to have a bound state [60, 61]. Its existence
must be due to the large mass-polarisation term in this case.

This term can be taken into account by an interesting method due to Armour [91]. We
are free to choose the origin of ˆHint to be at any of the three particles which make up the
system. Thus if we choose the origin to be at the electron rather than the proton,

Note that µ3 = µ2 on account of the symmetry of the reduced masses of particles 2 and 3
under the operation of interchange of these particles.

Now we can write this form of ˆHint as an operator, ˆA, in terms of r1 and r2 i.e., with

Clearly, ˆA has no physical signiﬁcance. However, Armour was able to make use of it in
a novel way to take into account the mass-polarisation term within the framework of the
inﬁnite proton mass approximation.

Because ˆA corresponds to ˆHint when the origin is taken to be at particle 2 rather than

ˆA will also have lowest eigenvalue E. It follows that

applied to it. In the case of (e+, H),

Q = 1.0011 and µ2 = 0.9995 me .

(3.41)

Thus it is not surprising that Armour [91] was able to show that no bound state of (e+, H)
exists, even if the ﬁnite mass of the proton is taken into account.

(µ+, e−, e+) is a very similar system to (p, e−, e+). However, the mass of the muon is
206.8 me, which is approximately a tenth the mass of the proton. Thus the eﬀect of the
mass-polarisation term will be greater for this system. Armour [92] applied his method to
this system for which

Q = 1.01 and µ2 = 0.995 me .

(3.42)

He was able to show that no bound state of this system exists.

He also applied it to (p, µ−, e+), which diﬀers from (p, e−, e+) in that the electron is
replaced by the µ−, which is much more massive. The (p, µ−) atom is much more compact
than the H atom and has a very much smaller dipole polarisability. The reason for this is
that the polarisability this scales as m−3
, where mr is the reduced mass of the atom. See, for
example, Bransden and Joachain [17]. As pointed out earlier, this polarisability determines
the magnitude of the attractive potential between the positron and the atom containing the
other two particles in the asymptotic region. Thus in this region, this potential is very much
smaller for (p, µ−, e+) than for (p, e−, e+).

For (p, µ−, e+),

Q = 1.254 and µ2 = 186 me .

Armour [92] was also able to show that no bound state of this system exists.

Particular three-unit charge systems

17

F.

(¯p, p, e−)

(¯p, p, e−) is a system containing an antiproton, a proton and an electron. As we are only
considering Coulombic forces, as pointed out in Sec. III A, the Hamiltonian for the systems
we are considering is invariant under the operation of charge conjugation, i.e., change of sign
of the charge of all particles in the system, this system is equivalent to (p, ¯p, e+).

In the absence of the electron, the proton and the antiproton can form a strongly bound
2µp¯p, where µp¯p is the reduced
and very compact protonium atom with ground-state energy
mass of the protonium atom. The expectation value of the internuclear separation in this
state is

−

3a0
2µp¯p

= 1.6

10−3a0 ,

×

(3.44)

where a0 is the Bohr radius.

The ground-state energy of protonium is the energy of the lowest continuum threshold
of (¯p, p, e−). It can be seen that in this state the expectation value of the dipole moment
resulting from the equal and opposite unit charges is very small indeed. Furthermore, the
is less than 10−6.
probability that the dipole moment has a value greater than 0.01 a.u.
A consequence of this is that the dipole polarisability of the (p, ¯p) atom, that determines
the magnitude of the attractive potential between the electron and ground-state protonium
asymptotically, is very small indeed, much smaller, even, than in the case of (p, µ−).

It is clear, therefore, that no bound state of (¯p, p, e−) exists. As we shall see in Sec. IV A,
the position of (¯p, p, e−) on the triangular plot of the stability properties of three-body
systems is so far into the unstable region as to be almost at one of the vertices associated
with this region. This is to be expected in view of the very small dipole moment and
polarisability of the (p, ¯p) atom in its ground state.

It is of interest to consider what would happen if the nuclei were ﬁxed. Such a system
has been extensively studied, in particular by Fermi and Teller [93], Wightman [94], Wallis
et al. [95], Mittleman and Myerscough [96], Turner and Fox [97], Levy-Leblond [98], Byers
Brown and Roberts [99], Coulson and Walmsley [100], Crawford [101], and Turner [102].

It is well known that no bound state of this system exists if the dipole moment of the sys-
tem is less than 0.639 a.u. As the nuclei have unit charge, this corresponds to an internuclear
distance, R, of 0.639 a0.

The Schr¨odinger equation for this system is separable in prolate spheroidal coordi-
It has been shown [101] that if R > 0.639 a0, the system has an inﬁnity of
nates [23].
bound states. As is to be expected, the inﬁnity is countable as it can be set in a one to one
relationship with the natural numbers. In these states the electron or positron has zero an-
gular momentum about the internuclear axis and no nodes in the part of the wave function
that is dependent on the hyperbolic coordinate. As R is increased, further inﬁnities of bound
states appear corresponding to higher values of one or both of these quantum numbers, the
ﬁrst appearing when R > 3.792 a0.

G. Muonic molecular ions

Muonic molecular ions are systems such as (p, µ−, p), (p, µ−, d), (d, µ−, d), etc. These
systems are analogous to molecular ions such as H+
2 , but they contain a negatively charged
muon rather than an electron. There has been considerable interest in the properties of
these systems as (d, µ−, d) and, in particular, (d, µ−, t), play a crucial role in the process

18

Stability of few-charge systems

known as muon catalysed fusion. See, for example, Bhatia and Drachman [103], Ponomarev
[104] and Froelich [105].

In a muonic molecular ion, (a, µ−, b), where a and b are protons, deuterons or tritons,
the dimensions of the molecular ion scale as me/mµ relative to (a, e−, b). Thus the nuclei
a and b are brought very much closer together than in (a, e−, b). Provided that (a, µ−, b) is
in a state of zero angular momentum and a and b are not both protons, fusion occurs at a
rate between 105 and 1012 s−1, depending on the nuclei involved. The proton-proton fusion
process is very much slower as it involves the weak interaction.

A muon has mean lifetime of 2.2

10−6 s before undergoing beta-decay. See, for example,
Semat and Albright [106]. Clearly, if a muon is to catalyse a large number of fusions, it is
important that the whole process takes place in a much shorter time than the lifetime of the
muon. There seemed little prospect of this until extensive theoretical work by Vesman [107]
and Gershtein and Ponomarev [108] showed that (d, µ−, d) and (d, µ−, t) can be formed by
a resonant process.

×

This resonant process can take place because of a remarkable coincidence. Both (d, µ−, d)
and (d, µ−, t) have weakly bound (J, v) = (1, 1) excited states, i.e.
states with angular
momentum J = 1 and in the ﬁrst excited vibrational state, v = 1. In the case of (d, µ−, d),
this state has binding energy 1.95 eV, whereas in the case of (d, µ−, t) it is 0.66 eV. These
binding energies are suﬃciently small for energy conservation requirements to be satisﬁed
by a process in which a low-energy (d, µ−) or (t, µ−) atom, in its ground-state, collides with
one of the nuclei of a (DA) molecule (A = D, H or T), in its electronic and vibrational
ground state, and attaches itself to the deuteron to form a muonic molecular complex,
[(d, µ−, d), a, e−, e−] or [(d, µ−, t), a, e−, e−], with the (d, µ−, d) or (d, µ−, t) in the (1,1) state.
The complex containing (d, µ−, t) rapidly undergoes Auger decay to a state of (d, µ−, t)
which has zero angular momentum. Fusion then occurs at a rate of 1011 – 1012 s−1. This is
the fastest fusion rate of any muonic molecular ion. So far, fusion rates of about 150 fusions
per muon have been observed in this process. The breakeven value for energy production is
about 480 fusions per muon.

The key role played by (d, µ−, t) in this process has focussed attention on the properties
of muonic molecular ions. It is known that ions that contain a proton have two bound states,
whereas (d, µ−, d) and (d, µ−, t) have ﬁve bound states and (t, µ−, t) has six bound states.
For details, see Ponomarev [104].

As the mass of the muon is mµ = 206.8 me, the Born–Oppenheimer approximation does
not give accurate results for these systems. Accurate results can be obtained starting from
this approximation, using the adiabatic representation method [104, 109]. However, even
more accurate results have been obtained using the Rayleigh–Ritz variational method, which
was ﬁrst applied to muonic molecular ions by Ko los et al. [110]. This method has been
extensively applied to the calculation of the energies of the bound states of (d, µ−, t) by, for
example, Bhatia and Drachman [111], Korobov et al. [112], Frolov [44], Hara et al. [113],
Hu [114], Petelenz and Smith [115], Szalewicz et al. [116], Kamimura [117], Alexander and
Monkhorst [118] and Zhen [119]. For further details, see Froelich [105].

A general approach to 3-body systems

IV. A GENERAL APPROACH TO THREE UNIT-CHARGE SYSTEMS

In this section, we study the stability of three-unit charge systems as a function of the
masses of the constituent particles. This problem has been addressed by many authors, in
textbooks [89, p. 286], in review papers [53], or in articles, see for instance [10, 120, 121,
122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127], and references therein.

In the literature, results have been obtained on how the binding energy evolves one or two
masses are varied, one of the precursors being [128]. There are also attempts to parametrise
the energy as a function of the constituent masses mi and use this parametrisation for a guess
at the stability border, see for instance [55, 129]. Some papers contain thorough numerical
investigations, where one or two mass ratios are varied. It is noted that this is a slightly
diﬀerent art to estimate accurately the energy of a well-bound system and to determine at
which value of a mass ratio binding disappears. For instance, in Ref. [120], the stability is
studied as a function of the mass ratios m1/m2 and m3/m1 and an interesting comparison is
made with existing results, but the matching between “molecular” states similar to H+
2 and
atomic states similar to H− gives an unphysical spike in the drawing of the stability border.
In Ref. [124], an astute changes of variables makes it possible to use harmonic-oscillator
type of wave functions, but while the binding energy of symmetric states with m2 = m3 are
= m3 extends too far, with,
accurately computed, the stability domain of states with m2 6
e.g., (M +, M −, m±) leaving stability for M/m > 2.45, while Mitroy [5] found it unstable.
Clearly, more cross-checks of the published results are needed.

ratio b/a has to be adjusted. The applicability of the virial theorem to variational solutions
was noticed by Hylleraas [130] and Fock [131].

2. The instability domain including A3 is star-shaped with respect to A3.
The same holds of course for A2. We have seen that A3 does not correspond to a stable
conﬁguration, for a point-like protonium atom does not bind an electron. Imagine a straight
line from A3 toward the inner part of the triangle, as pictured in Fig. 3. Moving along this
line means keeping the mass ratio α1/α2 constant while α3 decreases. A suitable rescaling
provides us with a system of inverse masses

In this rescaled system, the masses m1 and m2 are both constant, and thus the threshold
energy E(2) is ﬁxed, while m3 increases, thus strengthening the binding of any 3-body bound
state. This means that once the stability domain is entered, the system becomes more and
more strongly bound, as long as the (1, 2) atom is the lowest threshold.

D. Applications of the convexity properties

To illustrate the potential of the stability plot, let us take the example of the (1−, m+, 1+)
conﬁgurations. For m = 1, we have the positronium ion (or its conjugate), which is known
to be stable. For m large, we have (e+, p, e−) which is unstable, as reviewed in Sec. III. It
was stated there that the best rigorous limit for instability for this system is m

1.51.

∞

, m3 = 1 and m2 ≥

Consider now an indirect approach. ∞H− is weakly bound. If one changes the mass of
one of the electrons by about 10%, stability is lost. This corresponds to the point α in
Fig. 7. A very conservative but rigorous estimate by Glaser et al. [132] is that the system is
unstable for m1 =

Also, the system (1+,

1 (this is again (e+, p∞, e−)). The point β in Fig. 7 corresponds to the critical
for M
mass M at which instability occurs. It has been studied by several authors. See Sec. III.
For M = 1.51 or larger, the system is unstable. This value yields a conservative estimate
for β in Fig. 7. Thus γ at the intersection of αβ with the A2H axis (m1 = m3) is in a region
of instability. It follows from this that (e−, m+, e+) is unstable at least for m

(e−, m+, e+) is unstable for at least m

These values compare well with the numerical study by Mitroy [5], who estimated that

E. Stability domain for excited states

One needs to distinguish between two types of excited states.

1. States with the same quantum numbers as the ground state
2. First state with a (conserved) quantum number diﬀerent from the value in the ground

state

As explained in Sec. II, the relevant threshold should be identiﬁed. It might consist of an
excited atom for states of the second category, if radiative processes are neglected.

For this category of states, the variational principle (A1) is almost unchanged. We need
only note that the trial wave function used must belong to the subspace of the Hilbert
space of the system with the relevant quantum number, negative parity, for instance. Most
general results on the stability domain are immediately applicable for the ground state with
a speciﬁc quantum number, as, e.g., total angular momentum ℓ = 2, or negative parity.
However, there is a crucial exception: stability is no longer guaranteed along the symmetry
axis.

This corresponds to well-known properties: there are many excited states for H+

2 without
analogue in the case of Ps− or H−. The stability domain is then a small island near the
upper vertex A1, as schematically pictured in Fig. 8. A similar shape will be encountered in
the next section, when we consider the ground state with a reduced central charge q1.

For excited states with the same quantum number as the ground state (generalising
the radial excitations of 2-body systems), the variational principle no longer holds in its
simplest form. See Appendix A. Hence, the convex behaviour of each instability region
does not necessarily apply in the case of excited states. However, the star-shape property
remains, as it is a consequence of the fact that p2

V. THREE-ARBITRARY-CHARGE SYSTEMS

Once the domain of masses or inverse masses insuring stability of three unit charges
(+1,
1) has been established, it is interesting to go on and let the charges vary. This is
to some extent an academic exercise, to better analyse the binding mechanisms. However,
non-integer eﬀective charges are at work in media, due to screening or anti-screening eﬀects.
Changing the charges may also be a very useful test of the accuracy of diﬀerent calculational
methods and can help to understand the correlation eﬀects.

The stability of three-particle systems with arbitrary masses and charges was the subject
of Refs. [133, 134, 135]. We shall ﬁrst review studies carried out on speciﬁc conﬁgurations.

A. Speciﬁc conﬁgurations

Detailed studies are available in the literature on how H− and H2 survive if the charge Z of
the proton is increased. They will be summarise before other mass and charge conﬁguration
are considered.

In the limit where mp is inﬁnite, the Hamiltonian can be rescaled as

These stability domains would require thorough numerical investigation or more rigorous
results. For instance, it has never been established that the domain sometimes splits into
two parts, as suggested by one of these ﬁgures. What can be proved [134] is that the border
shrinks if q1 decreases (for the other qi ﬁxed) and moves to the right as q2 increases.

Suppose, for instance, that q2 increases. In the region where (1, 2) is the lowest threshold,
one can rescale all charges by a factor 1/√q2, so that the attraction q1q2 (and hence the
threshold energy), and the repulsion strength q2q3 remain constant. The attractive term q1q3
decreases, so stability deteriorates. If both q2 and q3 are increased by a factor λ, a similar
rescaling leaves the attractive terms unchanged and increases the repulsion by λ. Again,
one moves away from stability. It has been shown [135] that each domain of instability is
convex in the

plane (with, say, q1 = 1 ﬁxed.). This is illustrated in Fig. 13.

E. Numerical investigations

Modern computers and new computational algorithms make it possible to perform intri-
cate few-body calculations in a very short time, and thus to repeat the calculations with
changes in the parameters.

For instance, Krikeb [139] has drawn the stability area (more precisely its minimal exten-
sion, as his calculation was variational) for diﬀerent choices of constituent masses [135, 139].
Some of his plots are reproduced in Figs. 17–20. There is always a pronounced spike near
the threshold separation (T).

•

In the (q2, q3) plot, are there always points for which q3 > 1?
What is the overall shape of the areas of stability? This means a curve f (q2, q3) = 0
such that beyond this curve, stability never occurs, whatever values are assumed for
the constituent masses. A guess is proposed in Fig. 21.

Stability of few-charge systems

VI. FOUR-CHARGE SYSTEMS

In this section, we consider systems (m+

1 , m+
4 ) with arbitrary masses mi and unit
charges q1 = q2 = +1 and q3 = q4 =
1. The question we address is: for which values of
the masses mi is the system stable against spontaneous dissociation? The answer, of course,
only depends on the mass ratios and not on the masses themselves.

3 , m−

A. Lowest threshold

m2 and m3 ≥
2 , m−

The ﬁrst stage is to identify the lowest threshold. Without loss of generality, one can
m4, so that the lowest threshold consists of two neutral atoms
assume m1 ≥
is (m+
1 , m−
4 ). This can be seen directly from the Bohr formula. The results is
in fact more general, as noticed by Bertlmann and Martin [140] and by Nussinov [141]: if a
given two-body potential provides two constituent of masses m and m′ with a ground-state
energy E2(m, m′), then

E2(m1, m4) + E2(m2, m3) ,

(6.1)

≤

m2 and m3 ≥

when m1 ≥
m4. This is easily shown using the property that the two-
body energy E2(m, m′) is a convex function of the inverse reduced mass m−1 + m′−1.. For
instance, in the limit of a strictly ﬂavour-independent conﬁning force between a quark and
an antiquark, one anticipates a mass inequality

(QQ) + (q¯q)

2(Q¯q) ,

≤

(6.2)

which is observed in the actual spectrum of mesons [142].

1 m+

2 m−

3 ) + m−

There is another type of threshold with a three-body ion and an isolated charge. For
instance, (m+
m4, as
typical Coulomb energies grow proportionally with masses. However, an ion with charge
1, as their interaction reduces to a Coulombic attraction at
±
large separation (see Sec. A 11 of Appendix A). Thus, if the lowest threshold is an ion and
a charge, the system is stable.

4 is certainly the lowest threshold if m1 = m2 = m3 ≫

1 can always bind a charge

∓

In short, to establish stability, it is suﬃcient to get below the lowest atom–atom threshold,

i.e., to ﬁnd a trial wave function Ψ with a variational energy E4[Ψ] such that

E4[Ψ] < E2(m1, m3) + E2(m2, m4) .

(6.3)

Nevertheless, it is interesting to determine which is the lowest threshold. In Ref. [143],
for instance, dealing with hydrogen-like conﬁgurations (M +, M +, m−, m−), it is shown rigor-
ously that the lowest threshold always consists of two atoms, namely, in an obvious notation,

2E2(M, m) < E3(M, M, m) ,
2E2(M, m) < E3(m, m, M) .

(6.4)

In practical calculations, knowing that the lowest threshold of a system is made of cluster
C1 and cluster C2 suggests a possible trial wave function associating the internal motion
within C1 and C2 with the motion of C1 relative to C2.

B. Speciﬁc systems

1. H2

The binding mechanism of the hydrogen molecule, H2, is described in several textbooks.
A beautiful picture is provided by the method of Born, Oppenheimer, Heitler and Lon-
don [144]. In the limit where the proton mass M is very large compared with the electron
mass m, the protons move almost classically in an eﬀective potential V (R). Besides the direct
1/R, this potential is generated by the energy of the two electrons
electrostatic repulsion
in the static ﬁeld of the two protons separated by a distance R. At very large R, the system
consists of two independent atoms, and one ﬁxes the potential so that V (
) = 0. At very
small R, the repulsion dominates, and V
. In between, there is a well-pronounced
pocket of attraction with V < 0. In the extreme limit where M
, the minimum of V is
the binding energy of the molecule. This minimum is deep enough to guarantee that for the
actual molecule, binding survives numerical uncertainties, ﬁnite proton mass and quantum
eﬀects.

∞

∞

→

−

+

In fact, the potential V between the two protons is deep enough not only to bind the

molecule, but also to allows for many excited states. See, e.g., [145].

Several accurate, non-adiabatic, calculations of the H2 energy and properties have been
published, see, e.g., [146]. Note that it was once believed that a problem existed, with
a discrepancy between the experimental ionisation energy and the theoretical one [147].
Nowadays, the problem has disappeared.

2. Ps2

The stability of (e+, e+, e−, e−) with respect to dissociation into two positronium ions
(e+, e−) was speculated by Wheeler [60]. A ﬁrst study by Ore in 1946 led him to con-
clude [148] “with reasonable assurance that this structure is not stable against disintegra-
tion into two bi-electrons.” He used, however, a sharply truncated harmonic-oscillator basis
which is not appropriate for a weakly-bound molecule.

The following year, Hylleraas and Ore [149] introduced a more suitable trial wave-function
and the stability of the positronium molecule (m+, m+, m−, m−) was established, and con-
ﬁrmed in several further studies using more reﬁned wave functions. In natural units, the
positronium atom (m+, m−) has a binding E2 =
1/4, so that the dissociation threshold
for the molecule is Eth = 2E2 =
1/2. It is convenient to deﬁne the fraction x of binding
below threshold as

−

−

E(e+, e+, e−, e−) = (1 + x)Eth .

(6.5)

The result of Ref. [149], corresponding to x
0.0084, has been improved by several authors.
The latest (and best) values are x = 0.03186 [150] and x = 0.03201 [151]. See, also,
[152, 153].

≃

The proof of stability of Ps2 by Hylleraas and Ore [149] relies on an elegant variational
method. They ﬁrst got rid of the scale by noticing that if Ψ(ri) is a trial wave function,
with norm and expectation values of the kinetic and potential energies written as

but one does not gain much [154]. As analysed for instance by Ho [69] and by the authors he
quotes, some explicit r12 and r34 dependence is needed in the wave function to improve the
accuracy. Such a dependence is included in all accurate variational calculations [150, 151],
as well as in Monte-Carlo variants [152].

As Ps2 is weakly bound, one might guess that there are no bound excited states, and,
indeed, for many years, no excited state was found or even searched for. However, a recent
highly accurate calculation [151] indicates the existence of a state Ps∗
2 with angular momen-
tum L = 1 and negative parity. This cannot decay into two positronium atoms in their
ground state, as one of the atoms should be in a state with L = 1. The threshold energy for
spontaneous dissociation is thus

from annihilation of ordinary Ps atoms. This is discussed in Ref. [155].

3. PsH

The hydrogen “hydride” PsH is the system (p, e+, e−, e−), or in our other notation,
(M +, m+, m−, m−) in the limit of a large M/m mass ratio. The chemistry of positrons
is beyond the scope of this review. See, for example, Ref. [156, p. 263]. What is of inter-
est to us is the fact that, if annihilation is neglected, there are many examples of stable
conﬁgurations where a positron is attached to an atom or an ion [3].

The stability of PsH is not completely obvious, if one starts building this conﬁguration
by adding the constituents one by one. In a possible such construction scheme, one is faced
with the instability of (p, e+, e−), as seen in Sec. III E; it is thus a pleasant surprise that the
whole system is stabilised by adding a second electron. On the other hand, when one starts
from a Ps− ion and a proton, one expects some attraction between them. The question is
whether this attraction brings the system down not only below the (Ps−, p) threshold but
also the (H, Ps) threshold. A similar question arises when the system is viewed as a stable
H− ion combined to a positron.

The ﬁrst proof of stability of PsH is due to Ore [157]. He used a trial wave function

similar to (6.8), namely, with a similar notation (1 is the proton, 2 the positron)

Again, the scale parameter k can be ﬁxed by the virial theorem, and the minimisation is
restricted to the parameters α and β. Some details on the calculation of the relevant matrix
elements are given in Appendix D. For α = 0.25 and β = 0.5, Ore obtained an energy
E =
0.00334 of extra binding, deﬁned as in
0.75256 corresponding to a fraction x

Positronium hydride was identiﬁed experimentally in 1992 [159]. Meanwhile, variational
calculations have been pushed to higher accuracy. See, for instance, [150, 155, 160, 161,
162, 163, 164, 165, 166], and references therein. For instance, Zong-Chao Yan and Ho [166]

The system (p, e+, e−, e−) also has a resonant state with angular momentum L = 0. It is
located at E =
0.602 with respect to complete dissociation, and thus is relatively narrow
(width Γ = 0.0028) since it is below the threshold for dissociation into a hydrogen atom and
an excited positronium atom (Eth =
0.5625) [160]. There is also a metastable L = 1 state
0.5625 for dissociation into
at E =
a hydrogen atom and a Ps atom with L = 1. The situation is similar for the metastable
L = 2 state at E =
0.5267 corresponding

only through Coulombic forces, can be represented in terms of points in the interior, or on
the surface of a regular tetrahedron [167, 168]. This is a generalisation of the equilateral
triangle diagram in the case of three bodies, two of which have the same positive charge and
the third has the opposite negative charge [53, 123]. Note that as the Coulombic potential
between charges is invariant under charge conjugation, stability properties are invariant
under this operation.

Let αi = 1/mi, were mi is the mass of particle i. As only Coulombic forces are being
considered, the stability properties are dependent only on the ratios of the masses. It is thus
4
possible to normalise the αi so that
i=1 αi = 1. The sum of the distances from each face
to any point X, inside or on the surface of the tetrahedron, is a constant. If we choose the
(3/2), this constant is 1. Take αj to equal
length of the sides of the tetrahedron to be
the distance of the point X from face j. Then the set X (α1,α2,α3,α4), with 0

close to E(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0), the midpoint of AC. Any permutation of particles 1 and 2

and/or 3 and 4 also corresponds to H-H and thus the midpoints F,G and J of BC, BD
and AD, respectively, also correspond very nearly to H-H. All these points are thus
deep inside the domain of instability.

The plane KDC corresponds to systems with identical particles 1 and 2, with m1 = m2,
and the same charge. It can be seen that they are all stable. Similarly, the points of
the plane ABH represent systems with identical particles 3 and 4, which are stable.

The midpoint H of CD lies very close to (p, p, e−, e−), which is H2 and is known to
be bound. Similarly, the midpoint K of AB lies very close to (e+, e+, ¯p, ¯p), which
is the antihydrogen molecule with the same bound states as H2. The segment KH
corresponds to hydrogen-like conﬁgurations (M +, M +, m−, m−). In the middle, the
centre of the tetrahedron represents the positronium molecule.

with base AB or CD, which is symmetric about the median perpendicular to AB or CD on

Richard describes what is known about the form of the stability domain within the tetra-
hedron. The form on a triangular surface close to a vertex and parallel to the opposite
face is an interesting case. This surface is in the shape of an equilateral triangle and repre-
sents systems in which one particle is very much lighter than the other three. As Richard
points out, in this situation the existence or otherwise of four-body bound states depends on
whether the three very much heavier particles have a bound state that can form a charged
’nucleus’ that can bind the very much lighter particle, which is of opposite charge. It follows
that the form of the stability domain on the above surface is the same as for three particles,
two of which have the same positive charge and the other has the opposite negative charge
[168, 169], with upper vertex on AB or CD, the sides of the tetrahedron that are considered
to correspond to bound states. See Fig. 22. To summarise, the shape of the stability domain
is likely to be that schematically pictured in Fig. 23. Some guessed properties remain to
be demonstrated, and more numerical investigations would be needed for a more precise
drawing.

2. Hydrogen-like conﬁgurations

We have seen that (M +, M +, m−, m−) is stable for M

m and for M = m, but
this is shown with diﬀerent approaches: the Heitler–London method for hydrogen and the
Hylleraas–Ore variational method for Ps2. In fact one can show that the stability of Ps2
implies the stability of (M +, M +, m−, m−) for any value of the mass ratio M/m.

≫

The proof follows from the property that the ground state of an even Hamiltonian in one-
dimensional quantum mechanics is lowered by any odd admixture. If h(λ) = heven + λvodd,
the ground-state energy, e(λ), of h(λ) cannot be greater than the expectation value obtained
with the even wave-function corresponding to λ = 0, which is, of course, e(0). An illustration
is h(λ) = p2 + x2 + λx, whose ground state lies at e(λ) = 1
λ2/4. Here, parity is replaced
by charge conjugation [143, 170]. The Hamiltonian for (M +, M +, m−, m−) can be written

(M +, M +, m−, m−) for any M/m ratio. The additional binding provided by the term HA

3. Minimal extension of the stability domain

Once the binding energy E = (1 + x)Eth of conﬁgurations with m1 = m2 and m3 = m4 is
taken as ﬁrmly established by detailed variational calculations, a minimal extension of the
stability domain can be derived.

Consider ﬁrst (M +, m+, M −, m−) conﬁgurations as extensions of the Ps2 case. One can

Going back to more realistic cases, one can see that Eqs. (6.18) and (6.20) fail by a narrow

margin to establish the stability of PsH from the binding energy of Ps2.

Thus if it can be shown that a system (M +, M +, m−, m−) with mass ratio s = M/m = 2 is
bound by a fraction x(2) larger than 1/8, then it follows that PsH is stable.

These observations make it reasonable to conjecture that all molecules (m+

thresholds, one with M associated with the ﬁrst electron and M ′ with the second and another
in which M and M ′ are interchanged. There are thus two ways of describing the system
as two deformed atoms with a slow relative motion. These two components can interact

The conjecture of stability for m3 = m4 has been checked in Ref. [171]. The authors
used two variational calculations. The ﬁrst one is based on the exponential wave function

matrix elements are calculated in a close analytic form, there are no numerical uncertainties
as to the values of the integrals involved, so the investigation can be considered as free from
ambiguity.

5. Borromean binding

The concept of Borromean binding is inspired by the Borromean rings, which are inter-
laced in such a subtle topological way that if any one of them is removed, the two other
become unlocked. The name “Borromean binding” was introduced in Nuclear Physics [172]
to denote those isotopes with two external neutrons which are stable against dissociation,
while the partner with only one external neutron is unstable. The best-known example is
the Helium family. The nucleus α = 4He is very stable and compact. The isotope 5He is
unstable, but 6He is stable. If considered as a three-body system (α, n, n), it has the remark-
able property that none of the two-body subsystems has a bound state. In other words, with
short-range potentials, a three-body system can be bound, with coupling strength that are
too weak to bind the two-body subsystems. For an investigation of the domain of coupling
constant where Borromean binding is possible, see e.g., [173, 174, 175]

Borromean binding is related to the “Thomas collapse” [176], which occurs when the ratio
of 3-body to 2-body binding energies, E3/E2, is very large, and to the Eﬁmov eﬀect [177],
which is associated with the existence of very weakly bound 3-body bound states together
with a vanishing 2-body ground-state energy E2.

Borromean binding is deﬁned to occur in four-body binding as the property that all
three-body subsystems are unbound. In other words, there is no way to build the system
by adding the constituents one by one, forming a bound state at every stage. Of course, for
systems such as (a+, b+, c−, d−), there always exist stable two-body subsystems.

Now, Mitroy [5] established that (m′+, m+, m−) ions remain stable for

On the other hand, Bressanini et al. [152] found that the (M +, m+, M −, m−) systems are
stable with respect to dissociation into (M +, M −) + (m+, m−) for

This result is also obtained by Varga [178]. Thus for M/m
2, the 4-body molecule is
bound, but none of its 3-body subsystems is stable! This means, for instance, that the
molecule (p, d, ¯p, ¯d) made up of a proton, a deuteron and their antiparticles, is Borromean.
A minimal extension of the domain of Borromean binding can be established if one knows
the binding for m1 = m3 and m2 = m4 [179].

VII. SYSTEMS WITH FIVE UNIT CHARGES

Calculating the binding energy of a ﬁve-particle system is obviously a very complicated
task [180, 181, 182], especially when the system is loosely bound. A ﬁve-particle system can
have various bound subsystems including 3 + 2, 4 + 1 or 2 + 2 + 1 decompositions. The
binding energy is the energy of the system with respect to the lowest dissociation threshold.
We shall consider the case of systems of three particles with like charges and two particles
with the opposite charge. Systems of unit charges where four particles have identical charges
and the last particle has an opposite charge are not expected to be bound.

A.

(m+, m+, m+, m−, m−)

The simplest system consists of ﬁve particles with equal mass and unit charge. In the
case of where the three positively-charged particles are identical fermions with spin 1/2, the
antisymmetry requirement restricts the conﬁguration space and no bound state exists. In
particular, the system of three electrons and two positrons, or its conjugate, is not bound.
The (m+, m+, m+, m−, m−) system is, however, bound if the three positively-charged
particles are bosons or if one of them is distinguishable, since the Pauli principle does
not restrict the allowed states. An example is the (e+,e+,e−,e−,x±) system, where x± is a
ﬁctitious particle which has the same mass as the electron but is distinguishable from both
the electron and the positron. No such system exists in the real world. What is of practical
interest is that binding often remains when some masses are changed, in particular when mx
is increased. For example, a system made of a Ps2 molecule and a proton, (e+,e+,e−,e−,p),
is stable (see Subsecs. VII H and VII I below).

The energies of systems of N equal-mass constituents (with mass equal to me) are listed
in Table II, for both the boson and fermion cases. The Ps− ion and Ps2 molecule are well
known examples of such systems.

TABLE II: Energies of N -particle systems of unit charges and equal masses. The total charge is 0
and 1 for N even and odd, respectively. Atomic units are used.

In Table II, the energies of the bosonic and fermionic systems are equal up to N = 4. In
the bosonic case, the particles are considered to be spinless and the spatial part of the wave
function is symmetric in the coordinates of the identical particles. In the lowest-energy state
of the fermionic system (particles with spin 1/2), the spins of the pairs of identical particles
are coupled to zero. In this case the spin part of the wave function is antisymmetric and
the space part therefore has to be symmetric. Consequently, both the bosonic and fermionic
systems have symmetric spatial parts and their ground state energies are equal.

48

Stability of few-charge systems

B.

(M +, M +, M +, m−, m−)

A well-known stable Coulombic ﬁve particle system is the H+

3 molecule where the three
protons form an equilateral triangle sharing the two electrons. The stability of this system
is due to the slower motion of the heavier particles. If the mass of the protons were equal
to that of the electrons, there would be no bound ﬁve particle system, as we know from the
previous section. The question is at what heavy/light particle mass ratio is the stability
lost in the case of (M +, M +, M +, m−, m−). A system of three holes of mass mh and two
electrons in semiconductors is a realistic example of this. The stability of such systems has
been studied in [180]. The energy as the function of the electron/hole mass ratio is shown in
Fig. 25. The system is bound provided that the positively charged particles are at least ﬁve
times heavier than the two with negative charge (0 < σ = m/M < 0.2) (m = me, M = mh).
At higher value of the mass ratio, the system dissociates into a (M +, M +, m−, m−) molecule
and an isolated M +. Another possible dissociation channel is (M +, M +, m−) plus (M +, m−).
However, the energy of this 3 + 2 channel is always higher than that of the 4 + 1.

This study shows that the H+

3 molecule would remain stable even if the protons were be
much lighter. The system consisting of three protons and two negatively charged muons, i.e.,
(p, p, p, µ−, µ−) can be mentioned as an exotic example where σ < 0.2 (see Table III). The
mass ratio between the muon and the proton is about σ = 0.11 which is much larger than
that in the hydrogen atom (σ = 0.0005). The energy of the proton-muon atom is
92.92
a.u. The molecule formed by two proton-muon atoms is deeply bound just like the hydrogen
molecule [any (M +, M +, m−, m−) system is bound irrespective of the M/m ratio, as seen in
Sec. VI]. The binding energy divided by the reduced mass of the proton–muon atom is 0.07
in (p, p, µ−, µ−) and 0.02 in (p, p, p, µ−, µ−). The corresponding ratios for H2 and H+
3 are

to be compared to
the energy of the 3 + 2 dissociation channel is higher than that of the 4 + 1 one.

The diﬀerence between this case and the previously discussed H+

3 -like systems is that one
of the heavy particle is diﬀerent from the other two. Figure 26 shows how the total energy
varies with σ = me/mx). The total energy rapidly decreases toward the energy of the H2
threshold. The system becomes unbound around mx/me = 2.5. This result shows that an
H2 molecule can bind a positively charged particle provided that it is at least 2.5 times
heavier than an electron. So while the H2 cannot bind a positron it forms a bound system
with a positive muon µ+ (see Table III). The properties of this system are very similar to
those of H+
3 : The two protons and the muon form an isosceles triangle where the two protons
are somewhat closer to each other than to the muon and the electrons are slightly closer to
the protons than to the muon. If the mass of x+ approaches the mass of the electron the
distance between the protons and x+ increases and the electrons become more and more
localized around the protons. Eventually, for mx/me > 52.5, the system dissociates into H2
plus x+.

(M +, x+, x+, e−, e−)

By adding two positive charges to the H− ion, one obtains a (M +, x+, x+, e−, e−)-like

noting that the H−-like (M +, e−e−) negative ion behaves like a negative point charge and
can bind two positive charges, forming a H+
In the limit where mx is very
small, (M +, e− e−) binds two identical light particles in the same manner as a proton binds
two electrons in H−.

The (M +, x+, x+, e−, e−) system can dissociate into 4 + 1 [(M +, x+, e−, e−) + x+ and
(x+, x+, e−, e−) + M +)] and 3 + 2 [(M +, x+, e−) + (x+, e−) and (x+, x+, e−) + (M +, e−)]
subsystems. Figure 27 shows the binding energies as a function of me/mx < 1, in the case
where the mass of the heavy particle is equal to the mass of the proton, M = 1836.1527 me.
For these conﬁgurations with me < mx, the lowest threshold is is of the type 4 + 1.

Examples of such bound systems are (p, µ+, µ+, e−, e−) or (p, e+, e+, e−, e−), see Table
III. This latter system will be investigated in detail later. Table III shows that the energy
of (p, µ+, µ+, e−, e−), just like that of (p, p, µ+, e−, e−) in the previous example, is close to
that of H+
3 . The proton and the muon are likely to form an isosceles triangle but now the
like particles are further away from each other so the base of the triangle is longer than the
sides in this case. The most important diﬀerence is that so long as the me/mx ratio lies
between 0 and 1, this system remains bound.

This leads to speculation about the possibility of resonant states of this system. The fact
that the H−
2 is not bound is a consequence of the Pauli principle. Adding a negatively
charged particle x− which has the same mass as the electron (but is distinguishable from
it) to the hydrogen molecule gives a bound system. Its binding energy is about 0.096 a.u.
The x− particle can attach itself to the H2 molecule because the Pauli principle does not
constrain its motion.

Figure 28 shows the dependence of the binding energy on the mass ratio mx/me. The
threshold in this case is the energy of the (M +, M +, e−, x−) four-body system. The calcula-
tion is not trivial because the energy and structure very strongly depend on the mx/M mass
ratio. For mx/M
1,
the (M +, M +, x−) system forms a Ps+ ion-like system.

FIG. 28: Binding energy of (p, p, e−, e−, x−) as a function of me/mx. Atomic units are used.

Due to the heavy masses, the size of this system will be very small compared to that of
Ps+ and this small (M +, M +, x−) system will act as a positive charge and bind the electron.
The distances between the particles in (M +, M +, x−) will be very small compared to the
distance between the centre of mass of (M +, M +, x−) and the the electron. This system
can bind one more electron forming (M +, M +, x−, e−, e−), which is akin to H−. A possible
choice of x− is µ−. The (p, p, µ−) system is bound, and as the present calculation shows the
(p, p, e+, µ−) and the (p, p, e−, e−, µ−) systems are also bound. These systems remain bound
even if the masses of the heavy particles are slightly diﬀerent, e.g., the (M +

system is bound as a rough estimate for 1/3 < M1/M2 < 1.

(M +, M −, m+, m−, x+)

The next system considered is (M +, M −, m+, m−, mx+).

The four-body system
(M +, M −, m+, m−) is akin to the hydrogen-antihydrogen system and it is not found to
be bound if the mass ratio m/M is smaller than about 0.45, see Sec. VI. If the mass ratio
m/M is small, the two heavy particle with opposite charges form a small neutral particle
and the ion formed by the m+, m−and x+ particle will not be able to form a bound ﬁve-body
system with it.

G.

(M +, M +, M −, m−, m−)

This system can be characterized by a single mass ratio σ = m/M.

If m < M then
the dissociation threshold is the energy of the (M +, M +, M −, m−) system. The energy of
(M +, M +, M −, m−) as a function of σ is shown in Fig. 29. The (M +, M +, M −, m−, m−)
system is bound with respect to this threshold (see Fig. 30). (p, p, ¯p, e−, e−) is an example
of this system (see Table III). This shows that a hydrogen molecule is capable of binding an
antiproton to form a system similar to H−. If m > M then the relevant dissociation threshold
is given by the energy of (M +, M +, m−, m−). The (M +, M +, M −, m−, m−) system is bound
in the interval 1 < m/M < 2 (see Fig. 31).

There is a very interesting diﬀerence between these two cases.

In the ﬁrst case σ is
between 0 and 1. For small σ values the three heavy M particles form a positive ion. Its
size is small and it behaves like a single structureless positively-charged particle c+. This
makes it able to bind the two lighter charges forming (c+, m−, m−). The resulting system is
very similar to H−.

In the second case 1/σ varies between 0 and 1. Here in the limiting case where σ is
inﬁnite, one has two heavy m− particles and a composite positive charge “C +” formed
by (M +, M +, M −). This composite particle, however, cannot be viewed as structureless
in the presence of the heavier m− particles. Energetically it is more favorable to form a
(M +, m−) + (M +, m−) molecule than a (C +, m−, m−) system so the binding is lost at some
σ > 1.

H.

(e+, e+, e−, e−, x+)

The previous examples started from systems with two heavy positive and two light neg-
ative charges. The other end of the mass spectrum where one has two light positive and
two light negative charges has also been investigated. In this case the two negative particles
were electrons and the two positive particles were positrons. The sign of the charge of mx
is not important in this case. For the calculations reported in this section the extra charged
particle x+ is assumed to be distinguishable from the electron and the positron.

The ﬁve-body binding energy versus the mx/me ratio is shown in Fig. 32. When the
system has a mass ratio satisfying mx > me, the lowest energy threshold is the energy of
the (x+, e−, e−, e+) + e+) dissociation channel. This system is bound for all mass ratios such
that mx > me and it can be seen that that the binding energy of the ﬁve-particle system
increases with increasing mx.

When the mass of the distinguishable particle is lighter than that of the electron, i.e.,
mx < me, the threshold energy is the energy of Ps2 + x+. The binding energy decreases
steadily as mx is decreased. The system is no longer capable of forming a 5-particle bound
state when mx = 0.56 me. The structure of the (e+, e+, e−, e−, x+) system increasingly
resembles the structure of a system best described as x+ + Ps2. The dissociation limit is
approached as mx →

I. The e+PsH system

The e+PsH system, (p, e−, e−, e+, e+), corresponds to the case where mx = mp, and it is
clear from Fig. 32 that this system is bound. The system is stable against dissociation into
the H + Ps+, p + Ps2 or the PsH + e+ channels. The lowest threshold is the energy of the
PsH + e+ channel (0.789197 a.u.) and e+PsH is bound by 0.021050 a.u. with respect to this
threshold (see Fig. 33) A model for this system is a positron orbiting the PsH subsystem at
a relatively large distance from the nucleus.

VIII. LARGER SYSTEMS WITH BOSONS OR FERMIONS

Molecules are built up of multielectron atoms by various binding mechanisms. The charac-
teristic property of molecules is that multiple charged heavy atomic nuclei share a delocalised
electron cloud. The question considered in this section is the existence of bound states of
a system made of m particles of unit positive charge and n of unit negative charge. Such
states probably exist in the case of bosons with
zero or small. We have investigated
various systems with m electrons and n positrons, but we were unable to ﬁnd bound states
for 4 < m + n < 9. Another possibility that we have investigated is a system comprising a
proton, m electrons and n positrons, similar to HPs and HPse+.

The HPse+ = (H−, e+, e+) is a positively charged system so one may try to add one
more electron to see if it remains stable. The convergence of the energy is shown in Fig. 34.
The energy of the system slowly converges to the lowest (HPs + Ps) threshold and the
size of the system continuously increases showing that this system is unlikely to be bound.
Surprisingly, however, by adding two electrons to (H−,e+,e+) one gets a bound system, as
shown in Fig. 34. This system “H−Ps2” contains a proton, two positrons and four electrons,
and can also be considered as a three-body system made up of a proton and two Ps− ions
analogous to the H− ion (with the electrons replaced by composite Ps− ions).

IX. SYSTEMS CONTAINING ANTIPROTONS

This review mostly deals with how small atoms and molecules evolve when the familiar
negatively-charged electrons and positively-charged nuclei are replaced by other elementary
Investigations with positrons, and to a less extent, pions, muons or kaons
constituents.
have been carried out for many years, and are in the process of further development. In
recent years, however, the most spectacular progress have been observed in the domain of
antiprotons, thanks to the commissioning of sources of intense and cooled antiprotons, in
particular at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN). In this section, we shall
review the current state of knowledge in this area and prospects for the future.

A. Antihydrogen, protonium and other antiprotonic atoms

1. Antihydrogen atoms

Antihydrogen, H = (e+, ¯p), is the charge conjugate of the familiar hydrogen atoms. It has
been produced for the ﬁrst time at CERN [187, 188], by directing a high-energy antiproton
beam onto the electric ﬁeld of a nucleus, where it encountered virtual (e+, e−) pairs. The
experiment was successfully repeated at Fermilab [189].

Antihydrogen production is of considerable current interest on account of the successful
preparation at CERN in 2002 of about 50 000 atoms of H atoms, cooled to within 15
degrees of absolute zero. See Amoretti et al. [190]. This followed on from several years
preparatory work by the ATHENA project (ApparaTus for High precision Experiments
on Neutral Antimatter), Charlton et al. [191] and Holzscheiter et al. [192, 193], and the
competing ATRAP (Antihydrogen TRAP) project of Gabrielse et al. [194]. The most recent
results obtained by ATRAP are described by Gabrielse et al. [195].

Now that cold H atoms have been prepared, it should be possible to trap H at a suﬃciently
low temperature that the laboratory frame is essentially is essentially its rest frame. This
would make possible tests of the predictions of two fundamental theories of modern physics:
quantum ﬁeld theory and Einstein’s general theory of relativity. In particular, tests could
be made of the charge, parity and time-reversal (CPT or TCP) symmetry of quantum
ﬁeld theory. See, for example, Hughes [196], Schweber [197], and for a recent discussion,
Ref. [198].

It follows from the CPT symmetry that a charged particle and its antiparticle should
have equal and opposite charges. Also their masses and gyromagnetic ratios should be equal
and their lifetimes should be the same. In addition, this symmetry predicts that H and H
should have identical spectra [191, 192, 193, 194]. Experimentalists plan to test, as far as
possible, whether H and H do have these properties. In particular, they intend to compare
the frequency of the 1s-2s two-photon transition in H and H.

The equivalence principle, according to which all bodies fall at the same rate in a gravi-
tational ﬁeld, led Einstein to his general theory of relativity in which gravitation manifests
itself as a metric eﬀect, curved spacetime, as opposed to the ﬂat spacetime of special rel-
ativity in the absence of gravitation. See, for example, Weinberg [199] and Hughes [196].
The exact form of the curvature is determined by Einstein’s ﬁeld equations.

It is proposed to test the validity of the equivalence principle by carrying out a null red
shift experiment in which the frequency of the two-photon 1s-2s transition is observed for H
and H as both are moved through the same gravitational ﬁeld. Any diﬀerence between the

Systems containing antiprotons

59

two sets of values would indicate that the two atoms experienced a diﬀerent gravitational red
shift, which can be shown to be a violation of the equivalence principle [191, 196]. However, it
must be said that the possibility of such a violation is much more remote when gravitation is
viewed from the standpoint of general relativity as resulting from the curvature of spacetime,
rather than as a force obeying an attractive inverse square law, as in the Newtonian theory.

2. Protonium

Protonium, (p, ¯p) often denoted by Pn, is the heavy-mass analogue of the positronium

atom. The 1s energy and radius are of the order of 12 keV and 50 m.

1 preferentially populated. Strong interaction eﬀects are negligible as long as n

When antiprotons are stopped in a dilute hydrogen target, antiproton capture takes
place in a state of high principal quantum number n of the order of n = 40. The electron
is expelled and the antiproton quickly cascades down to lower orbits, with circular orbit
ℓ = n
2.
For the 2p state, strong interaction becomes important. States are shifted, but due to the
pronounced spin dependence of the nucleon–antinucleon interaction, the singlet state, and
the triplet states with J = 2, 1 or 0 are moved diﬀerently. The annihilation with also
becomes dominant with respect to radiation to the 1s ground-state. If the target is chosen
to be more dense, protonium states often penetrate inside the hydrogen atoms, where they
experience a strong electric ﬁeld which produces a Stark mixing of (n, ℓ = n
1) states with
states of lower ℓ, and eventually states with ℓ = 0 or ℓ = 1, in which annihilation takes
place. This is the Day–Sucher–Snow eﬀect, which is important to understand the initial
state of annihilation experiment. For a recent review on protonium, and references, see,
e.g., Ref. [200].

Exotic atoms such as protonium give rise to an interesting quantum-mechanical problem,
Z/r is supplemented by a short-range term U(r), which is
in which the Coulomb potential
sometimes chosen to be complex, to mimic the eﬀect of absorption or annihilation. A naive
application of perturbation theory suggests that the energy E changes with respect to the
pure Coulomb energy Ec (with wave function Ψc) by

−

which is unsatisfactory, as it gives too large a correction. The shift, indeed, remains small,
even if U(r) is an inﬁnite hard core. The shift, in fact, is proportional not to the strong-
interaction potential U, but to its scattering length a, and this shift is small as long as

3. Ordinary antiprotonic atoms

(9.1)

(9.2)

When an antiproton is captured in the ﬁeld of a nucleus, it usually cascades down very
quickly toward low-lying orbits close to the nucleus. The electrons surrounding the nucleus
are either expelled or remain at large distances. Hence, with the remarkable exception
of metastable antiprotonic Helium states, on which more below, the few-charge problem

60

Stability of few-charge systems

decouples: within a distance of a few fermis, or a few tens of fermis, we have a two-body
atom consisting of a nucleus of charge Z and an antiproton; then, at the usual atomic scale,
we have an ion with an eﬀective nucleus of charge (Z

1) and a few electrons.

The energy levels of the antiproton are shifted and broadened by strong interaction.
This gives a measure of the antiproton–nucleus interaction, to be compared with data from
antiproton–nucleus scattering experiment, and theoretical expectations based on folding the
antiproton–nucleon amplitude with the wave-function of the nucleus. For a review and
references, see, for instance, Ref. [201].

B. Three unit-charge systems with antiprotons

If one combines and antiproton with protons, positrons, and electrons, one gets the

following three-body systems.

(¯p, e+, e+) is the conjugate of H−. It could in principle be formed and compared to
H− to test CPT symmetry,

(¯p, e+, e−) is unstable,

•

•

•

(¯p, p, p) is stable with Coulomb forces only. Its study could probe the long-range part
of the strong interaction between a proton and and antiproton.

C. Antiprotonic helium

In the limit where the positive charges are very heavy compared to the negative
charges, the four-charge conﬁgurations (M +, M +, m−, m′−) reduce to Helium-like atoms,
say (M ++, m−, m′−). The spectroscopy of the He atom is well known and documented
[16], and thus will not be discussed further. The existence of at least one bound state of
(M ++, m−, m′−) is rather intuitive: the M ++ nucleus can bind the heaviest of m and m′,
and there is a long-range Coulomb force left to bind the lightest negative charge.

Let us take ﬁrst the limit where M is inﬁnite. If m = m′, we have the familiar Helium
atom, with the two electrons in the 1s orbit. Indeed, unlike the case of H, for which the
correlation between the electrons is crucial (see Secs. III C and D 2). If, for instance, m′
m,
the α particle and the particle of mass m′ form a compact core of charge +1, which forms
a hydrogen-like atom with the light particle m. The binding of m and that of m′ occur at
diﬀerent scales, and there is almost no three-body eﬀect for this ground state.

≫

Kondo, and Russel, inspired by anomalies in early data on kaonic atoms, have shown that
the dynamics becomes more intricate for some excited states. For references, see, e.g., [202].
If the heavy negative charge m′ is in an excited state, such that its mean separation from
M ++ becomes comparable to that of m, then the radiative and Auger transitions become
suppressed. Experiments with negative muons µ−, and later with antiprotons on Helium
have revealed, indeed, delayed transitions to lower states.

The utility of these long-lived states is even better than might be expected. Some of
these antiprotonic “atomcules” have smaller intrinsic width than conventional excited states
of ordinary atoms, and thus can serve as a improved prototypes to deﬁne and measure
fundamental quantities (antiproton mass or magnetic moment, ﬁne structure constant, etc.).

Systems containing antiprotons

61

It is not our aim here to review all properties of these antiprotonic Helium states, nor
to discuss the elaborate theoretical calculations by Korobov et al. and Y.Kino et al. We
refer the reader to the recent review by Yamazaki et al. [202], and to the Proceedings of the
LEAP03 conference [203].

In the spirit of our discussions on the how the stability of three- or four-charge systems
depends on the involved masses, we note that the metastability of these new atomcules
has been studied with 4He and 3He, and also with muons and antiprotons.The use of an-
tideuterons [204]. The CERN antiproton source could be tuned to produce, collect and
cool antideuterons, at a rate of about 10−3 that of antiprotons, largely suﬃcient for capture
experiments.

An interesting question is also whether the dramatic metastability observed in CERN
experiments could survive a smearing of the Helium core. Suppose one replace He++ by two
deuterons: are there metastable states in the four-body molecule (d, d, ¯p, e−)?

D. Four unit-charge systems with antiprotons

1. Symmetry tests

The antihydrogen molecule (¯p, ¯p, e+, e+), the protonium molecule (¯p, ¯p, p, p) and the
positronium antihydride (¯p, e−, e+, e+) are examples of conﬁgurations that are stable if the
interaction is purely Coulombic. They will only become interesting if they can be used in
high-precision experiments to test the CPT symmetry of quantum ﬁeld theory [205] or mea-
sure the proton-antiproton interaction at a range of distances at which it cannot be obtained
accurately from a spectroscopic study of protonium.

2. HH

There has been interest in calculations on the interaction of H with H, since the 1970s,
Junker and Bardsley [206], Morgan and Hughes [207], Ko los et al. [208], Campeanu and Beu
[209], Shylapnikov et al. [210]. However, the work on the preparation of H described above
has generated greater theoretical interest in this system, Armour et al. [169, 211, 212, 213,
214, 215] Jonsell, Froelich et al. [216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222], Sinha and Ghosh [223],
Voronin and Carbonell [224].

The H-H system is a four-body system similar to the H2 molecule.

in that it contains
two nuclei of the same mass as the proton and two light particles with the same mass as the
electron. However, both the nuclei and light particles have equal but opposite charges. As
might be expected, this leads to very signiﬁcant diﬀerences from H2.

One of the most obvious is that if the nuclei coincide in H2, the resulting system is He,
whereas when this happens in H-H, the resulting nucleus has zero overall charge and thus
clearly cannot bind the light particles.

It is reasonable to assume that the critical internuclear distance Rc, below which a ﬁxed
proton and antiproton cannot bind the electron and the positron is greater than 0.639a0.
This can be seen as follows. We know from the work on (p, ¯p, e−) described in Sec. III F and
the invariance of the energy levels of this system if the electron is replaced by a positron
that, if R < Rc, the electron and the positron would be unbound if they did not attract

62

Stability of few-charge systems

each other. In addition, the attraction between them makes possible separation into ground
state positronium, which is

0.25 a.u. lower in energy.

It might be thought that such a result would be easy to prove. However, this does not

−

seem to be the case.

Ko los et al. [208] showed that Rc < 0.95 a0, using the Rayleigh–Ritz variational method
and a trial function containing Hylleraas-type functions. Armour et al. [212] went on to show
R < 0.8 a0, a ﬁxed proton and an antiproton can bind an electron and a positron. They used
a method similar to Ko los et al., but included a basis function to represent weakly bound Ps,
a long way from the nuclei. More recently, Strasburger [225] has shown that Rc < 0.744 a0,
using the same variational method but with a basis set made up of explicitly correlated
Gaussian functions, similar in type to those used by Kamimura [117] in his calculation of
the energy levels of (d,µ−,t).

The lowest continuum threshold of H-H is Pn + Ps, where both are at rest in their ground
states, at inﬁnite separation. Note that we can obtain continuum states with any angular
momentum, as close in energy as we please to this threshold, by associating the angular
momentum with the motion of the centre of mass of either the Pn or the Ps. The threshold
459.29 a.u. This is due to the very low energy of the ground state
has a very low energy,
of Pn. For Pn in this state, the expectation value of R is 0.0016 a0, which is far below the
value of Rc. In view of these two properties of Pn + Ps, it is very unlikely that a bound
state of H-H exists, though this has not so far been proved rigorously [167].

−

More deﬁnite evidence for the absence of an H-H state has been obtained by Bressanini
et al. [152] using the variational Monte Carlo method (VMC) [226]. They investigated the
stability of systems made up of two pairs of particles (M +, M −) and (m+, m+), where each
e, where e is the charge on the proton. According
pair has the same mass and charge
to the VMC method, if M is chosen so that M
m, then no bound state of the system
1.7. Using the diﬀusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) method, they obtain
exists if M/m
M/m
2.2. These results are likely to be accurate but are not rigorous. However, in view
of the fact that M/m = 1836 for H-H, it seems incredible that there should be a bound
state in this case. The high value of the mass ratio strongly suggests that H-H must lie far
inside the domain of instability of systems of the above type.

E. Antihydrogen–Helium

We have seen that in the case of HH if the nuclei are ﬁxed then there is a critical value
Rc, of the internuclear distance, R, of the order of a Bohr radius, below which the nuclei
are unable to bind the electron and the positron. The situation is diﬀerent in the case of
HeH [214]. This is because the He nucleus has charge +2. Thus the nuclear potential is
Coulombic asymptotically, rather than dipolar as in the case of HH. It is attractive for the
electron and repulsive for the positron.

At R = 0, HeH corresponds to positronium hydride (PsH). This is known to have a
bound state with binding energy, 1.06 eV [227]. There are continuum thresholds for HeH
corresponding to antiprotonic helium + positronium, He+¯p+Ps, and He¯p + a positron (e+),
as well other thresholds involving more extensive decomposition of HeH.

At R = 0, He+¯p corresponds to H + Ps and He¯p + a positron to H−+ a positron. They
14.45 eV, respectively, with respect to completely separated
have energies of
systems. Thus the the continuum threshold involving antiprotonic helium is lower at R = 0.

It follows that these two thresholds must cross at some point between R = 0 and R =

As the Schr¨odinger equation for the Born-Oppenheimer potential of He+¯p helium is separable
in prolate spheroidal coordinates, the threshold energy for He+¯p + Ps can be calculated very
accurately [228]. The Born-Oppenheimer potential for He¯p can be calculated accurately us-
ing the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method. The results obtained for both thresholds indicate
that crossing occurs in the vicinity of R = 1.25 a0 [229]. A very accurate Born-Oppenheimer
potential has been obtained by Strasburger and Chojnacki [230], using the Rayleigh-Ritz
variational method and a basis set made up of 768 explicitly correlated Gaussian functions.
Comparison of the value of this potential with the energies of the two continuum thresholds
considered above, shows that the helium nucleus (α) and the antiproton are able to bind the
electrons and the positron at all R values. This is in contrast with the situation in the case
of HH in which the electron and the positron become unbound if R is less than the critical
value, Rc.

In fact, of course, the nuclei are not ﬁxed. We have seen that in the case HH the ground
state energy of protonium is very low and the expectation value of R in this state is very
small, so small that is incredible that the dipole formed by the proton and the antiproton
would be able to bind the electron and the positron.
The ground state of (α, ¯p) has an energy of

2938.2 a.u. and the expectation value of
R in this state is 0.0005 a0, both of which are considerably lower than the corresponding
values for HH. However, as noted earlier, there is a key diﬀerence between the two systems:
whereas Pn forms a dipole, α + ¯p has a net charge of +1. Thus, it is very close to being a
single particle with the same charge as the proton but a much larger mass.

−

As mentioned earlier, H + Ps is known to form a bound state, positronium hydride (PsH).
If the inclusion of the three leptons only perturbs the ground state of the nuclei to a small
extent, so that there is a state of He¯p in which the α-nucleus + ¯p are in a state that diﬀers
only slightly from the ground state of these nuclei on their own, then it can be expected
that HeH will have a ground state whose leptonic wave function is very similar to that of
PsH. It would thus have a bound state. Furthermore, removal of a positron from the system
in this state would give rise to He¯p in a state with electronic wave function very similar to
H− in its ground state, which we have seen earlier is a bound state. Thus, if the presence
of the leptons has only a small eﬀect on the nuclear ground state, both HeH and He¯p will
form bound states. It will be of interest to see whether the existence of such states can be
proved. For a recent study of HeH, see [231].

F. Perspectives

Positrons are nowadays commonly used in fundamental and applied physics. The physics
of antiprotons is becoming accessible thanks to the development of sophisticated trapping
and cooling devices.

Stability of few-charge systems

Light antinuclei (¯d, ¯t, 3He) are currently produced in antiprotons factories (¯d was identiﬁed
in 1965 by Zichichi et al. [232]). The rate is much lower than for ¯p, but is is suﬃcient to
form and study a few atoms.

So, in principle, one could conceive of delicate systems with ¯d instead of ¯p or a mixture

of ¯p and ¯d, such as the Borromean molecule discussed in Sec. VI C.

X. FEW-CHARGE SYSTEMS IN TWO DIMENSIONS

z

Two-dimensional (2D) charged-particle systems are often used as a model of excitonic
complexes conﬁned in semiconductor quantum wells. When a thin layer of a material on the
xy plane is sandwiched between two layers of another material that has a diﬀerent dielectric
constant, electrons and holes in the middle layer are basically conﬁned by a potential Vc(z) =
d/2 and Vc(z) = V0 otherwise, where d is the thickness of the middle layer, with a
0 if
large value of the conﬁning potential V0. Hence every wave-function approximately factorises
into a z-component which is the ground state of Vc, and an horizontal component where the
interesting dynamics takes place. This is why 2D-systems are thoroughly studied, in addition
to their intrinsic interest. Some basic properties of bound states in 2D-quantum mechanics
are reminded in Appendix A 10.

The most important property of the conﬁned 2D system is the increased binding en-
ergy. This is even more pronounced for large systems than for the small ones of which
the dissociation threshold consists, and the binding energy increases as compared to the
three-dimensional case, even if measured in units of the threshold energy.

The binding energies of some 2D and 3D electron–hole systems are compared in Table IV.

The total energies of 2D electron-hole systems as a function of the mass ratio σ = me/mh
are shown in Fig. 35 (see Fig. 25 for the corresponding 3D case). The binding energy of the
2D system is almost by a factor of 10 larger than that of the corresponding 3D system.

66

Stability of few-charge systems

FIG. 35: The total energies of 2D electron-hole systems as a function of the electron hole mass
ratio σ = me/mh.

The binding energy in general decreases by increasing σ from 0 to 1, and this trend is
especially dramatic in the case of X+
2 . The 2D (eeh), (ehh) and (eehh) (Fig. refvkf9 systems
are bound irrespective of the mass ratio, just as in the corresponding 3D cases. In 2D and
3D the (eehhh) forms a bound system for small values of σ, while the (eeehh) system is
unbound for any values of σ. The critical value of σ is

σcr < 0.27 for 2D ,
σcr < 0.23 for 2D .

(10.1)

.

The properties of the 2D and 3D systems are found to be generally very similar. Even
though the binding energy and therefore the relative distances between particles are very
diﬀerent in 2D and 3D, the binding energies show very similar behaviour as a function of σ
(see e.g., Fig. 36). It is a striking similarity that the stability of the (e, e, h, h, h) is lost at
nearly the same value of σcr in 2D and 3D.

We should point out here that the electron-hole complexes are highly nontrivial quantum
mechanical systems in both 2D and 3D. The relative motion of the particles is complicated
and it is impossible to model these systems using some rigid geometrical picture, e.g., by
assuming that the (e, e, h, h) forms a static square in 2D. The interpretation of the (e, e, h, h)
molecule as a system of two exciton atoms is also an oversimpliﬁcation.

XI. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

→

In this review, we have addressed the question whether a system of point-like charges,
interacting through their Coulomb potential, form a collective bound state with all particles
remaining at ﬁnite distance the ones from the others, or split into clusters or isolated charges.
In a few cases, the answer is obvious: a positive charge q = +2 can bind two electrons,
since after having attached a ﬁrst electron, it still exerts a Coulomb attraction on the second
one. On the other hand, a tiny positive charge q

0 cannot bind two electrons.

In most case, the answer depends on the mass ratios. For three unit charges, the positro-
nium ion (e+, e−, e−) and other symmetric systems are stable, as well as nearly symmetric
systems, while very asymmetric systems such as (e−, p, e+) or (p, ¯p, e−) do not form a three-
body bound state.

3 , m−

1 , m+

For the case of four unit charges, (m+

2 , m−
4 ), there is also a premium to symmetry,
since all systems with two identical particles, e.g., m3 = m4, are stable, and among them
the twice-symmetric positronium molecule, Ps2 = (e+, e+, e−, e−). However, starting from
Ps2, it is observed that breaking charge-conjugation symmetry into (M +, M +, m−, m−) with
= m improves stability, whilst breaking permutation symmetry into (M +, m+, M −, m−)
M
quickly result into a loss of stability. The question is whether symmetry breaking beneﬁts
more to the collective state than to its threshold, or vice-versa.

This problem of stability has been investigated by many authors since the beginning of
quantum theory. Rigorous results have been obtained, with simple or sophisticated methods
of mathematical physics. This subject has also stimulated extremely accurate and innovative
variational calculations.

In nuclear physics, there are striking diﬀerences between compact, double-magic nuclei,
where nucleons are tightly bound together, and halo nuclei with a tail of neutrons extending
very far, though in both cases, we are dealing with stable bound states. One can similarly
notice wide diﬀerences among bound states of charged particles. In the case of three-body
bound states with unit charges, it is customary to distinguish “molecular” from “atomic”
ions. The former ones, whose prototype is (m−
3 ) = (e−, p, p) = H+
2 , have a large
= m3 [234], and
excess of binding below the threshold, easily survive symmetry breaking m2 6
have several excited states. The latter ones, as the hydrogen ion H− = (p, e−, e−) have not
stable excited state, and a small binding energy which quickly disappear if m2 is allowed
to diﬀer from m3. The change from atomic to molecular states is analysed in [126], with a
diﬀerent language, and also identiﬁed in [234].

2 , m+

1 , m+

For four-body systems, there is even a wider variety of situations. While Ps2 is weakly
bound, the H2 ground-state lies more deeply below its threshold. Some states are well
described as two atoms with a relative orbital motion, while others look more as a compact
ion surrounded by a light particle. After the completion of this review, an investigation of
(m+Z, e+, e−, e−) stability was investigated by Mitroy and Novikov [235], with the mass and
charge of ﬁrst particle being varied.

Clearly several aspects deserve further investigations, in particular for systems of more
than four particles, for which the available numerical investigations could be extended and
summarised by outlining the shape of the stability domain.

Many of the results presented here can be extended to cases where the potential is not of
Coulomb type. Let us give an example. When discussing the shape of the stability domain
for a 3-body system (m+
3 ), we have used the property that in the sub-domain with
the lowest threshold (m+
3 , stability survives and is even improved when the mass

m3 is increased while m1 and m2 are kept ﬁxed. This result holds for any 3-body Hamiltonian
with a potential that does not depend on the constituent masses.

The Coulomb and other power-law (rβ) potentials provide the simpliﬁcation that the
m−β/(β+2), when a factor m is applied to the masses. Hence the

energies scale like E
problem of stability of a N-body system depends only on (N

1) mass ratios.

∝

There is, however, a major diﬀerence between on one hand Coulomb or other long-range
potentials and on the other hand dipole–dipole potentials or sharply decreasing potentials
such as the Yukawa potential: the former support a countable inﬁnity of bound state however
small is the coupling, while the latter require a minimal strength to achieve binding. Note
that, as pointed out in Sec. III F, once the minimal strength has been attained, a dipole–
dipole potential can support a countable inﬁnity of of bound states.

The transition from short-range to long-range potentials is interesting. Bressanini et al.
[236], for instance, studied how the spectrum of familiar atoms and molecules evolveo when
the Coulomb potential becomes screened, say 1/r
λr)/r. Interestingly, they found
that larger systems are better armed to survive screening. For some values of the range pa-
rameter λ, the H2 molecule remains bound while all smaller systems have lost their stability.
This means that the Borromean behaviour denoted for the exotic conﬁguration (p, d, ¯p, ¯d)
is already underneath for more familiar ions and molecules. The subject of Borromean con-
ﬁgurations with more than four constituents, with or without screening, is one of the many
developments to be envisaged in this domain.

APPENDIX A: SOME BASIC RESULTS ON SCHR ¨ODINGER OPERATORS

We summarise here some results that are often referred to in this review.

1. Variational principle for the ground-state

The best known formulation reads as follows. For a system with Hamiltonian, H, the
expectation value of the energy of any trial wave function, Φ, is an upper bound to the
ground-state energy, E0, i.e., if Ψ0 is the normalised ground-state wave-function, then

E0 =

Ψ0i ≤

|

E[Φ]

≡

h

Φ
i

|
Φ
Φ

.

(A1)

This result if often used to prove binding, as to prove this, it is suﬃcient to obtain one wave
function Φ such that E[Φ] lies below the appropriate threshold. It is also the basis of the
Rayleigh–Ritz variational method, where Φ is parametrised to approach Ψ0 as closely as
possible. See, e.g., Refs. [17, 144].

The variational principle implies the following stationary property, which is valid for all
levels. If Φ = Ψn + ϕ, where ϕ is small, Φ will be “close” to Ψn and E[Φ] will diﬀer from
En by a term that is second order in the small error function, ϕ.
Note that if one separates out the c.m. motion, say H = (

2mi + ˆHint, the
variational principle with square-integrable wave function applies to ˆHint, but, in practice

2. Variational principle for excited states

The variational principle keeps the same simple formulation for the lowest level diﬀer-
ing from the ground state by any quantum number corresponding to an exact symmetry.
Examples are the ﬁrst state with angular momentum J, or the ﬁrst state with odd parity,
etc.

As noted, e.g., by Karl and Novikov [237], one can still use the stationary property to
get reasonable estimates for radial excitations. For instance, a two-parameter trial-function
with a node would give a good idea of the radially excited s-wave in a central potential.
However, more parameters would lead to a wave function with an almost invisible node near
r = 0 that would approach the ground-state. In other words, there is no guarantee that the
wave function would remain close to the 2s state during the minimisation.

To get an upper bound and achieve converged variational calculation, one used the “min-
imax” principle. The n-th eigenvalue (in a sector of given conserved quantum numbers) is
bound by the largest eigenvalue of the restriction of H to an n-dimensional subspace
Hn of
the Hilbert space

proximate wave functions, a requirement which is important for estimating some transition
rates.

A consequence of Eq. (A2) is that if there are n linearly-independent approximate eigen-
function with energy expectation below the threshold energy Eth, then the number of bound

3. Comparison Theorem

If an upper bound on the number of bound states is required, a lower rather than an
upper bound to the eigenvalues of the system is required. This is, in general, much more
diﬃcult to obtain [78].

The comparison theorem (see, for example, Ref. [20]) is a very useful method for obtaining
an upper bound on the number of bound states of a system. This theorem states that if two
Hamiltonians ˆH1 and ˆH2 are such that

and ˆH1 has exactly n bound states, n is an upper bound to the number of bound states of
ˆH2.

In practical applications of this theorem, ˆH2 is taken to be the original Hamiltonian for
the problem, while ˆH1 is the Hamiltonian of a more tractable system. It follows from this
theorem that if E(1)

and multiply all masses by m and all charges by q, and expand all distances by a factor ρ,
ρrij. The kinetic term gets a factor m−1ρ−2 and the potential ones a
in particular rij →
factor q2ρ−1. These factors become equal to an overall energy rescaling by a factor ǫ = mq4,
if the distances are scaled by ρ = m−1q−2.

This scaling can also be understood from the stationary property of the eigenstates. The
expectation value of H has a vanishing derivative at ρ = 1, if the exact wave function
Ψ(r12, . . .) is used to build a trial wave function Φ(ρ) = Ψ(ρr12, . . .).

As noted by Hylleraas [130], Fock [131] and many others, most basic properties of the
exact solutions remain true for variational solutions, with the mild restriction that the set
of trial wave functions is globally invariant under rescaling. This is true for the scaling
properties of energies and wave functions.

Scaling considerably reduces the parameter dependence of the few-body Coulomb prob-

lem. In particular, all hydrogenic systems

have similar energy spectra and eigenfunctions. The properties of a Coulomb system con-
taining N particles depend only on (N

1) mass ratios and (N

1) charge ratios.

Scaling laws are easily generalised to other power-law potentials rβ
Partial scaling holds for most other potentials. Consider for instance the spectrum of

ij. See, e.g., Ref. [238].

With the same conditions as for scaling, this property extends to variational estimates, thus
reducing by one the number of parameters to be varied (see, e.g., Appendix D below).

For other power-law potentials, the rule is T = αU/2 [238]. For more general potentials,

the potential energy αU is replaced by the expectation value of rdV /dr.

7. Concavity property of the ground state

We further assume that H depends on λ linearly. Then, the ground-state energy is
a concave function of λ.
Indeed, the second order derivative, as given by second-order
perturbation theory, is always negative. Another, simpler, derivation makes use of the
variational principle [89].

The result does not hold for individual radial excitations, but it is true for the sum of n

ﬁrst levels.

Again, the result can also be written for variational solutions, provided the same set of

trial functions is used over the whole range of values of the parameter λ.

8. Symmetry breaking

We often use the property that the ground-state of an Hamiltonian H with a certain

symmetry has its energy “lowered” if a symmetry-breaking term is added to H.

Consider ﬁrst the one-dimensional oscillator (with ~ = 1) h0 = p2 + x2, whose ground
h0 + λx, as can be seen by direct

state lies at ǫ0 = 1. It becomes ǫ(λ) = 1
computation.

More generally, if

H(λ) = Heven + λHodd ,

(A15)

is an even Hamiltonian modiﬁed by an odd term, one can use the variational principle with
the even ground-state Ψ(0) of H(0) as trial wave function, and derive the following relation

the diﬀerence being of second order in δ(m−1). A similar averaging of inverse masses is
adequate for isospin-breaking eﬀects in simple nuclear models or quark models with isospin-
conserving forces, to account for the mass diﬀerence between proton and neutron or between
u-quark and d-quark.

A current but not always correct statement is that “a symmetry-violating term will push
the lowest (even) level down and the ﬁrst excited (odd) state up”. This is true if the
additional interaction has negligible matrix elements between any of two ﬁrst levels and the
higher states. Then the eﬀect of symmetry breaking can be described by a 2

and the sum of eigenvalues (trace) is conserved as the mixing strength ǫ is varied. This
is, however, a closed system, a condition that often does not hold for physical examples.
For instance, in the case of p2 + x2 + λx, all levels are pushed down when the odd term is
switched on.

A more systematic way of constructing Jacobi coordinates consists ﬁrst of rescaling ri =

of Jacobi coordinates.

The choice of the Jacobi coordinates is often dictated by the approximation scheme one
intend to use. For instance, if a four-body system is described as a weakly bound atom–
atom system [(1,2)(3,4)], the choice (A25) seems convenient, with a wave function of the
form Ψ = ϕ(x) ˜ϕ(u)Φ(v).

It is well known that an attractive potential (V

0, but V not always vanishing) in one
dimension always supports a bound state with E < 0. For instance, one may consider V
deeper than a tiny square well

The same result holds in two dimensions. See, e.g., Refs. [239, 240]. A more precise
statement is that V supports at least one bound state for n = 1 and n = 2 dimensions if

V (x)dnx < 0.
A possible way of being convinced that n = 2 is the critical value of the dimension
R
for binding in any attractive potential relies on the simple “delta-shell” interaction V =
R). There is a bound state if the zero-energy wave function has a node.

APPENDIX B: VARIATIONAL METHODS

The principle of a variational method is to write down an empirical expansion of the wave
function on a set of basis functions involving free parameters and to adjust the parameters
to optimise the results.

In this section we overview the most popular forms of variational basis functions used
in correlated few-body calculations and compare their relative eﬃciency and accuracy on
selected few-electron systems.

We also extend our discussion to hyperspherical harmonics, numerical grid, Monte-Carlo
methods, and compare them to conventional variational methods in terms of convergence
and accuracy.

1. Parametrisation of the wave function

With some appropriate form of the basis functions, appropriate (e.g., exponential, har-
monic oscillator, Coulombic or Gaussian), the matrix elements can be calculated analytically.
Expanding the wave function in such a basis leads to an a accuracy of the method that can be
improved almost arbitrarily by increasing the number of basis functions. The convergence,
however, depending on the form of the basis functions, is often very slow.

a. Hylleraas and Exponential basis functions

For small systems (two- or three-electron systems) traditionally the best results have
been obtained by variational calculations in Hylleraas coordinates in which the trial wave
function for the example of a two-electron system is written in the following form

The results can be signiﬁcantly improved by combining linearly two or three wave func-
tions of the above type with diﬀerent values of α and β [46]. The diﬀerent values of α and
β control the asymptotic, intermediate and short range sectors:

Stability of few-charge systems

Thakkar and Koga [242] later introduced an other variant of the above ansatz with

fractional powers.

A diﬀerent exponential basis, without the explicit inclusion of the powers in the radial

coordinates, is also very powerful [243]

where αi, βi and γi are chosen in a quasirandom way, so the calculation is similar to a
Monte-Carlo calculation with a random distribution of the exponential factors.

Korobov [33] signiﬁcantly improved Thakkar’s method by introducing complex αi, βi, γi
parameters making the variational ansatz more ﬂexible. Frolov [244] used the similar vari-
ational function but carefully optimised the nonlinear parameters instead using random
distributions.

These forms represents a diﬀerent direction in the computations. In the early days when
the computational power was very limited, compact analytical representations were essential.
With the advance of computers simpler basis functions (but larger basis dimensions) became
more popular.

The exponential/Hylleraas type functions are very powerful but the analytical evaluation
of the basis functions is complicated or even impossible for more than two or three electrons.
Goldman [245] suggested a quite a diﬀerent approach: his idea is to uncouple the correlations
by using appropriate new variables. To calculate the radial part of the matrix elements of
the Hamiltonian one has to integrate

I =

where f (r1, r2, r12) comes from the basis functions and Hamiltonian. By introducing the
perimetric variables

s = r1 + r2 ,

v = r12/s , w = (r1 −

r2)/r12 ,

the integral can be rewritten as

and if the f function has the form

f (s, v, w) = S(s)V (v)W (w) ,

(B6)

(B7)

(B8)

then the integral is fully uncoupled into a products of one-dimensional integrals. With the
help of this trick certain forms of correlated basis functions can be used for systems with
larger number of electrons.

Signiﬁcant progress has also been made in handling integrals with an exponential on the
relative distances for the four-body problem. See [246, 247, 248], and references therein.
This oﬀers an alternative to the Gaussian parametrisation.

is a very popular choice of basis functions in atomic and molecular physics. Here ˜r stands
for a one-row vector whose ith element is ri. The merit of this basis is that the matrix
elements are analytically available and unlike other trial functions (for example, Hylleraas-
type functions) one can relatively easily extend the basis for the case of more than three
particles. The well-known defects of this basis are that it does not fulﬁl the cusp condition
and its asymptotics does not follow the exponential falloﬀ. This latter problem, especially
for bound states, can be cured by taking linear combinations of adequately chosen CGs. The
translational invariance of the wave function is ensured by requiring that the parameters A
fulﬁl some special conditions. These conditions ensure that the motion of the centre-of-mass
is factorised in a product form.

By combining the CG with the spin function parts, the full basis function takes the form

A{
with an appropriate spin function χSMS , where “k” is the index of the basis states and
an antisymmetriser for the identical fermions.

Instead of optimizing the parameters of A it is more advantageous to rewrite the equation

where αji (i < j) is assumed to be equal to αij. There are two reasons to choose this form.
The ﬁrst is that in choosing αij in this way we deal with a correlation function between the
particles i and j, while Aij has no such direct meaning and during the optimisation it is
more diﬃcult to limit the numerical interval of Aij to be chosen from. Secondly, one can
utilize this speciﬁc form to make the individual steps of the parameter selection very fast.

2. Optimisation of the parameters

To obtain very precise energy, one has to optimize the variational parameters uki and
Akij of the trial function. The dimension of basis sets is typically between 100 and 1000,
and each basis state has nine nonlinear parameters. The optimisation of a function with a
few thousands nonlinear parameters cannot be done eﬃciently by using a straightforward
deterministic optimisation method, since this could entail the complete reconstruction of the
Hamiltonian matrix and diagonalisation every time when some of the nonlinear parameters
are altered. Moreover, the deterministic search for the optimal value of such a large number
of parameters is likely to get trapped in a local minimum.

a. Frolov’s method

This author mainly used exponential functions to perform a variety of three-body calcu-
lations and some studies of larger systems. His so-called “two-stage” strategy is presented,
e.g., in Ref. [251]. Only the ﬁrst non-linear parameters are optimised exactly. The next
terms in the variational expansion are chosen to vary in a regular manner that is described
by just a few parameters.

b. Kamimura’s method

ci exp(

The group of Kamimura has used Gaussian wave functions in a variety of few-body
calculation. A comprehensive description of the method is given in a review article [252].
There are two main ideas. Firstly, in a given variable r, the range parameters αi of ψ

∝

say αi+1/αi = αi/αi−1 =

in the wave function, to be supplemented by analogous terms with clusters (1,3) and (1,2).
The physical interpretation is to construct interferences of several virtual-decay channels.

A procedure based on the stochastic search for the best set of nonlinear parameters can
be programmed eﬃciently and is capable of achieving highly accurate results for most few-

body systems. The essence of the strategy can be summarised as follows: Let

The essential reason motivating this strategy is the need to sample diﬀerent sets of nonlinear
parameters as fast as possible. The main advantage is that it is not necessary to recompute
the complete Hamiltonian nor it is necessary to solve the generalised eigenvalue problem
from scratch each time a new parameter set is generated. By changing the elements of
parameter set for each basis function individually, it is necessary to recompute only one row
(column) of the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices each time the parameter set
is
changed. Furthermore, the solution of the generalised eigenvalue problem is also expedited
since the Hamiltonian matrix is already diagonal apart from one row and one column.

ui, Ai}

{

A similar strategy to the above was used when adding additional terms to the basis.
The above way of ﬁnding the best parameters is certainly very restricted. Even this simple
method gives very accurate energies, as seen in applications to various ﬁelds [184, 253, 254].
More sophisticated techniques may give better results in a smaller basis size.

3. Real space approaches

The representation of wave functions in “real space” on a numerical grid (mesh) is a very
simple and powerful technique. In the simplest case, the basis functions are simple Dirac
delta functions

fi(xj) = δij

in the coordinate space point xj. A more sophisticated choice pioneered by Baye et al. [250]
uses inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable Lagrange-Laguerre functions

fi(xj) = (

1)ix1/2
i

−

LN (xj)
xi
xj −

exp(

xj/2)

−

where LN (x) is the Laguerre polynomial of degree N and xi is one of its zeros, i.e., LN (xi) =
0. The fi(x)fj(y)fk(z) product of the one dimensional basis functions can be used to expand
the functions of relative motions in an N-electron problem. This representation is very
ﬂexible and approximates the exact wave functions extremely well.

The advantage of the mesh techniques is that matrix elements can be trivially calculated.
The potential matrix is diagonal therefore it is particularly simple independently of the form
of the potential. The Hamiltonian matrix is very sparse so powerful linear algebraic iteration
techniques such as Conjugate Gradient method with eﬃcient multigrid preconditioning can
be used to solve the eigenvalue problems.

4. Hyperspherical harmonics approach

The method of hyperspherical expansion is widely used in atomic physics, especially in
its variant “adiabatic approximation”. See, e.g., [72, 255, 256, 257, 258], and the detailed
review by Lin [259] for details and references. In the accurate calculation by Mandelzweig
et al., the method is compared with other variational methods [72].

Schematically, in the case of three particles, the two Jacobi variables ρ and λ are replaced

by an overall distance and a set of ﬁve angles,

r = (ρ2 + λ2)1/2 , Ω5 =

ˆρ, ˆλ, tan−1(ρ/λ)

A partial wave-function expansion

Ψ(ρ, λ) =

u[L](r)
r5/2 Y[L](Ω5) ,

X[L]
in terms of the generalised harmonics
results into a set of coupled diﬀerential equations
for the radial components u[L]. Here, [L] denotes the “grand” angular momentum L and
associated magnetic numbers compatible with rotation and permutation invariance. The
convergence is studied as a function of the maximal value of L which is allowed. In practice,
the number of equations grows very rapidly as L is increased. Several approximation schemes
have been proposed, such as “potential harmonics” [257] and “adiabatic approximation”
[255, 259]. An interesting variant is proposed in [260].

5. Faddeev equations

The Faddeev equations [261], ﬁrst written to describe scattering in momentum space with
short-range potentials, have been reformulated in position space, and applied to a variety of
problems involving even conﬁning potentials or long-range Coulomb potentials [262, 263],
after suitable modiﬁcations.
If the Hamiltonian reads

with the kinetic energy T and the pair potentials V1 = v(r23), etc., then a decomposition

H = T + V1 + V2 + V3 ,

Ψ = Ψ1 + Ψ2 + Ψ3 ,

associated to the set of equations

(E

T )Ψi = ViΨ ,

i = 1, 2, 3 ,

−

implies the original Schr¨odinger equation HΨ = EΨ. Permutation symmetry is easily
implemented by imposing relations among the Ψi.

In practice, one often used a partial-wave expansion of each Faddeev component Ψi(ρ, λ)
to account for all internal orbital momenta ℓρ and ℓλ compatible with a given overall angular
momentum J. One obtains a set of coupled integro-diﬀerential equations in ρ and λ. The
convergence is studied by varying the maximal value allowed for ℓρ and ℓλ.

Faddeev equations are not primarily aimed at competing to obtain the most accurate
values of the binding energy. Their main merit is to produce high-quality wave-functions,
accounting for the correlations, even when restricted to the lowest values of ℓρ and ℓλ.

6. The Variational Monte Carlo method

The Variational Monte Carlo method (VMC) is a very powerful numerical technique that
estimates the energy and all desired properties of a given trial wavefunction without any
need to analytically compute the matrix elements. It poses no restriction on the functional
form of the trial wavefunction, requiring only the evaluation of the wavefunction value, its
gradient and its Laplacian, and these are easily computed. Using the VMC algorithm,
essentially a stochastic numerical integration scheme, the expectation value of the energy
for any form of the trial function can be estimated by averaging the local energy HΨ/Ψ over
an ensemble of conﬁgurations distributed as Ψ2, sampled during a random walk using the
Metropolis [264] or Langevin [265] algorithms. The ﬂuctuations of the local energy depends
on the quality of the trial functions, and the VMC can also be used to optimize the trial
functions.

A popular and eﬀective approach to building compact explicitly correlated wavefunctions
is to multiply a determinant wavefunction by a correlation factor, the most commonly used
being the Jastrow factor. The inclusion of the Jastrow factor is only possible by VMC
techniques.

There are various sophisticated trial wave functions have been implemented and tested.
The most simple but typical trial function is written assuming a Pad´e factor exp[(ar +
br2)/(1 + cr)] for the electron nucleus wave function and a Jastrow factor exp[a′r/(1 + c′r)]
for the interelectronic part [266]:

where ΘSM is the spin function. The Pad´e factor is simple but good choice for the nucleus-
electron part providing ﬂexibility with small number of parameters, representing the coales-
cence as well as the decay of the wave function for r

, respectively.

0 and r

As an example, we compare in Table VI the ground state energy of the Be atom obtained
with this simple VMC ansatz with results of other approaches including those which use
correlated Gaussian basis functions. This simple form does not give very precise energy,
but the energy can be improved by using more elaborate correlation factors (an example is
shown in the second line of Table VI) or by using diﬀusion Monte-Carlo method. The main
advantage of the VMC is that while it is not necessarily the most precise method for small
systems its applicable to larger systems with favorable scaling properties.

7. Short-range correlations

A quantity of interest for exotic systems involving positrons and antiprotons is the lifetime
due to internal annihilation of a (e+, e−) or a (¯p, p) pair. It is proportional to the probability
per unit volume of ﬁnding these constituents at zero separation, i.e., to an expectation value
of the type

δij =

within the exact wave function Ψ, assumed here to be normalised.

Computing δij accurately is much more diﬃcult than estimating the binding energy,
or an observable that is spread over the whole range of the wave function [68, 72, 268].
It often happens that an approximate variational wave function is excellent in the region
relevant for estimating the energy E =
, but, for instance, underestimates the wave
i
function at large distances, and then overestimates its value at large separation, in order
to remain properly normalised. This is the case when harmonic oscillator wave functions

Several variants for calculating δij have been proposed [271]. Perhaps, the method of
matrix-element identities works best at the beginning of a variational expansion, to speed
up the convergence of δij towards the neighbourhood of the exact value, but does not help
much once one is seeking at very high accuracy. According to [272], indeed, “for low-lying

APPENDIX C: THE BORN–OPPENHEIMER APPROXIMATION

In 1927, soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics, Born and Oppenheimer [273]
were able to obtain an approximate solution of the Schr¨odinger equation for a molecule by
separating the electronic and nuclear motions. This was possible on account of the much
larger masses of the nuclei, as compared to the mass of the electron. Born and Oppenheimer’s
treatment can be formally justiﬁed in terms of a perturbation expansion of the exact non-
relativistic energy and wave function in terms of the parameter, (me/M)1/4, where me is the
mass of the electron and M is the average mass of the nuclei.

This approximate quantum mechanical treatment of molecules, known as the Born–
Oppenheimer (BO) approximation, has always played a central role in the study of molecular
structure. Descriptions of the BO approximation are given in, for example, Bransden and
Joachain [17] and Pauling and Wilson [144].

For simplicity,

let us consider how the BO approximation is applied to a diatomic
molecule, containing N electrons and two nuclei, A and B, with masses MA and MB and
charges ZA and ZB, respectively. Our treatment can be extended to more complicated
molecules.

The ﬁrst step in the BO approximation is to ﬁx the nuclei in space with a given R value
and solve the Schr¨odinger equation for the electrons interacting with each other and with
the nuclei through the Coulombic force. The equation is of the form

ˆHelΨ(r; R) = E(R)Ψ(r; R) ,

where ˆHel is the electronic Hamiltonian. Ψ(r; R), where r
(r1, r2, . . . , rN ), is the elec-
tronic wave function and E(R) is the sum of the electronic energy at the given R value and
the energy due to the Coulombic repulsion of the nuclei.

where rij is the distance between electrons i and j and riA and riB are the distances of
electron i from nuclei A and B, respectively.

The electronic wave function, Ψ(r; R), depends parametrically on the internuclear vector,
R. Its dependence on the direction of R is easily taken into account. The z-axis of the
electronic coordinates is normally taken to be along R; the probability of a given orientation
is determined at a later stage with the calculation of the nuclear wave function, χ(R).

E(R) and Ψ(r, R) are determined as functions of R. Except in very simple cases such as
H+
2 , for which N = 1, for which equation (C1) is separable in prolate spheroidal coordinates,
only approximate solutions can be obtained using the Rayleigh–Ritz variational method.
The quality of the approximate solutions for a given molecule has improved very signiﬁcantly
over the years with increases in computer power and the ingenuity of quantum chemists.

The nuclei are considered as two particles moving in the central potential, V (R), where

V (R) = E(R) .

(C3)

Thus their centre of mass motion is separated out in the usual way. The nuclear wave func-
tion, χ(R), for the internal motion of the nuclei, is determined by the nuclear Schr¨odinger

is the reduced mass of the nuclei. ET is the energy, in the BO approximation, of the molecule
under consideration. The associated BO wave function, ΨT (r, R) is of the form

The most common states to be treated using the BO approximation are the states as-
sociated with the electronic ground state, i.e. the solution, (or solutions, in the event of a
degeneracy), of equation (C1) that corresponds to the lowest minimum value of E(R), as
a function of R. However, excited electronic states can also be treated. In principal, it is
possible to obtain a complete set of BO solutions of the form in equation (C7). This would
necessarily involve continuum states.

In the BO approximation the terms in the full Schr¨odinger equation for the internal
motion of the molecule that represent coupling between the nuclear and electronic motion
are neglected. They are the term containing

and the term containing

∇Rχ(R)

RΨ(r; R)

· ∇

χ(R)

2
RΨ(r; R),

which result from the operation of ∇R on the electronic wave function.

Also the ratio of the mass of the electrons to the masses of the nuclei is assumed to be
inﬁnite, resulting in their neglect in the centre of mass separation. This would have to be
corrected in an exact treatment. Allowance for the large but not inﬁnite electronic-nuclear
mass ratio leads to the introduction of small mass polarisation terms in the Hamiltonian that
= MB, the momenta of the electrons
couple the momenta of the electrons and also, if MA 6
and the nuclei. See, for example, Ko los and Wolniewicz [274].

A simple improvement to the BO approximation, called the adiabatic approximation, is

to set

In equation (C11), the round brackets indicate integration with respect to the electronic

Calculations of corrections to the BO approximation as applied to H+

2 and HD+ are
referenced in Sec. III B. The corrections to the BO approximation for the ground state of
diatomic two-electron molecules have been calculated by Ko los and Wolniewicz [274]. The
correction to the energy is small in comparison with the binding energy of these molecules,

4.74 eV, calculated using the BO approximation. This is a consequence of the large value
of µ/me ≥
However, as pointed out in Sec. III G, the BO approximation does not work well for
muonic molecular ions. In the case of dtµ, for example, the ratio of the reduced mass of the
d and t to the mass of the electron is 10.7, which is much smaller than the value of µ/me
in the case of diatomic, two-electron molecules.

A comparison is made of the binding energies of the ﬁve bound states of dtµ in the table
in ref. [276] as calculated using the BO approximation, the adiabatic approximation and
by a very accurate variational calculation using the full non-relativistic Hamiltonian for the
internal motion of dtµ. The binding energies for the most weakly bound state, the J = 1,
v = 1 state that plays a crucial role in muon catalysed fusion, obtained by the BO and
adiabatic approximations and the variational method are 9.7, 7.7 and 0.66 eV respectively,
showing the considerable errors that result from the two approximations.

It is of interest to note that the adiabatic representation method referred to in Sec. III G,
which was used by Ponomarev and his co-workers [109] to correct the error in the BO
approximation, involved the use of many BO basis functions of the form in equation (C7) in
a close-coupling type calculation using the full Hamiltonian for dtµ referred to above. For
details of applications of reﬁnements of the BO approximation to the tµ + D2 reaction in
the muon catalysed fusion cycle, see Zeman et al. [277].

Corrections to the BO approximation in the case of HH have been calculated by Armour

et al. [213] using the method described by Hunter et al. [278].

A very similar approximation to the BO approximation, the adiabatic-nuclei or nuclear-
impulse approximation, can be used to separate the nuclear and electronic motion in scat-
tering calculations involving atoms and/or molecules. See, for example, Chase [279], Chang
and Temkin [280], Lane [281]. For applications to positron scattering, see Armour [282].

Introduction

In this Appendix, we present a few basic calculations concerning systems of 3 or 4 charges.
Some of them are borrowed from pioneering papers that illustrate the ability of quantum
theory and variational methods to reproduce or even predict the properties of systems more
complicated than the hydrogen atom. The analytic results presented below, when properly
generalised, are basic ingredients of powerful variational methods presented in Appendix C.

strength to unity and the repulsion strength to 1/Z, leading to the well-known “1/Z” ex-
pansion. See, for instance, [136, 137].

When the repulsion among electrons is neglected, one can solve exactly the unperturbed

In the case of H−, binding is reached since the variational energy E =

and vice-versa.

The Hughes–Eckart or mass-polarisation term p1.p2 has obviously a vanishing expectation
value within this wave function (D8). Thus, if the ﬁnite mass of the nucleus is taken into
account, both the threshold energy and the variational energy are rescaled by the same factor
M/(M + m), where m is the mass of the electron and M that of the nucleus. Thus, with
this wave function, the fraction of binding is the same for all isotopes of Helium (neglecting

(M +m−m−) are demonstrated to be stable (and within this approximation, with the same
fraction x and same anticorrelation b/a).

The wave function (D8) or even a superposition of wave functions of this type will never
approach very closely the exact solution, as it lacks one degree of freedom, namely some
dependence on r12, the distance among the electrons. A wave function that allows for this

We predict that pairs of polar molecules can be weakly
bound together in an ultracold environment, provided that a
dc electric ﬁeld is present. The ﬁeld that links the molecules
together also strongly inﬂuences the basic properties of the re-
sulting dimer, such as its binding energy and predissociation
lifetime. Because of their long-range character these dimers
will be useful in disentangling cold collision dynamics of po-
lar molecules. As an example, we estimate the microwave
photoassociation yield for OH-OH cold collisions.

A recurring theme that has emerged in the study of ul-
tracold matter has been one of control over interparticle
interactions. Most notably, magnetic ﬁelds [1–4] and res-
onant laser light [5] have been employed to alter atomic
scattering lengths, inﬂuencing in turn the behavior of
Bose-Einstein condensates. Perhaps even more intrigu-
ing is the ability, using the same tools, to catalyze the
production of diatomic molecules [6–11]. When the ini-
tial atomic sample is Bose condensed, there can result
coherent superpositions of atoms and molecules [11] in a
process dubbed “superchemistry” [12]. More broadly, ex-
ternal ﬁelds may be expected to guide chemical reactions.
Chemical processes involving atom exchange have been
considered at ultralow temperatures [13–16], and have
been observed so far experimentally in the context of
three-body recombination [1,11] and vibrational quench-
ing [9].

A prerequisite to eﬀective control over atoms or
molecules is a clear understanding of their interactions at
ultralow temperatures. Even for alkali atoms, ab initio
potentials have insuﬃcient accuracy to predict scattering
lengths; this statement is even more true for molecules.
Investigators must therefore rely on key experimental
data that will unravel threshold scattering properties of
molecules in the most straightforward way. For the alkali
atoms, an eﬃcient tool for extracting scattering lengths
has been optical photoassociation (PA) to weakly-bound
states of alkali dimers. The states in question are gener-
ated by spin-orbit couplings that lead to avoided cross-
ings in potential curves at large values R of interatomic
separation (typically tens of Bohr radii) [6]. Because of
their long-range character, they are insensitive to details
of the small-R potentials that are poorly characterized.
Free-to-bound optical spectra of these states therefore
contain, in a reasonably accessible form, important in-
formation on scattering phase shifts [18].

More recently, even more exotic molecular states

have been predicted to exist in ultracold environments.
Greene and collaborators have predicted Rydberg states
of diatomic molecules with elaborate electronic wave
functions, whose density plots resemble trilobites [19]
or butterﬂies [20]. In addition, Cˆot´e, Kharchenko, and
Lukin have identiﬁed possible molecules composed of
hundreds of neutral atoms clinging to a single impurity
ion in a Bose-Einstein condensate [21].

In this Letter we introduce another set of unusual
molecular states. These are composed of two ground-
state polar molecules held at large intermolecular sepa-
ration under the joint inﬂuence of electric dipole forces
and an external electric ﬁeld. The properties of these
metastable dimers, such as binding energy, intermolec-
ular separation, and predissociation lifetime, depend
strongly on the value of the ﬁeld, leading to new types
of control over intermolecular interactions. These states
may be populated by rapid electric ﬁeld ramps, or else
by the analog of photoassociation spectroscopy in the mi-
crowave regime. Below we describe the origin and proper-
ties of these states, and estimate the trap loss rates asso-
ciated with their formation and subsequent dissociation
in microwave PA experiments. In this way we sketch a
general strategy for understanding and manipulating cold
collisions of polar molecules produced by either Stark de-
celeration [22] or buﬀer-gas cooling [23].

For concreteness we will consider dimers of two OH
molecules, to be denoted [OH]∗
2, although the phe-
nomenon should apply quite generally to polar molecules,
for example NH3 [22], that suﬀer a linear Stark eﬀect at
experimentally realizable ﬁelds. We have previously de-
scribed a model for the OH-OH interaction Hamiltonian,
including the parity, spin, and nuclear spin degrees of
freedom that are most relevant at ultralow temperatures
[24]. The OH ground state has spin j = 3/2, which, cou-
pled to the nuclear spin i = 1/2 of the proton, gives total
spin f = 2 in the molecular states we consider. For clar-
ity, we restrict the present model to molecules that are
spin polarized with mf = f = 2, and neglect couplings to
diﬀerent values of mf . Further, we incorporate only the
partial waves L = 0, 2. These restrictions do not change
the qualitative behavior of the model [24], but they do
render its structure more tractable.

The scattering thresholds in this model are set by the
Stark splitting Λ(E) of the molecular levels. At the rela-
tively low ﬁelds of interest here, rotational states are not
substantially mixed by the ﬁeld, but the opposite parity
states of the molecule’s Lambda doublet are mixed. Thus
there is a weak tendency for the ﬁeld to align the dipole
moments, along the ﬁeld when ω < 0, and against the

1

ﬁeld when ω > 0, where ω is the projection of j along the
body axis of the molecule (these alignments are reversed
when the laboratory projection mj < 0) [25]. For con-
venience we refer to these alignments, valid at inﬁnitely
large intermolecular separation, as ↑ and ↓, respectively.
A set of adiabatic potential energy curves for our model is
shown in Figure 1(a), where the dc electric ﬁeld strength
is taken to be E = 104 V/cm.

FIG. 1.

(a) Adiabatic potential energy curves for the
∗
six-channel model of [OH]
2, as described in the text. Avoided
crossings in these curves create the potential well
labeled
Vb, which holds bound states of the dimer.
(b) shows the
electric-dipole coupling matrix element between Vb and the
ground state V0.

When the separation between the molecules is not in-
ﬁnite, the partial wave L is no longer a good quan-
tum number, diﬀerent values being mixed by strong
anisotropies of the dipole-dipole interaction. The adi-
abatic channels shown therefore represent diﬀerent ori-
entations of the intermolecular axis relative to the
laboratory-ﬁxed electric ﬁeld axis, as indicated schemat-
ically by the diagrams within ellipses. For example, con-
sider the highest threshold where both molecules point
against the ﬁeld. The attractive adiabatic potential cor-
responds to a combination of L = 0 and 2 partial waves
that places the dipoles end-to-end on average, whereas
the repulsive curve places the dipoles side-by-side on av-

2

erage.

When the molecules approach still closer to one an-
other, there is an inevitable curve crossing between the
repulsive potential correlating to the | ↑i+ | ↓i threshold
and the attractive potential correlating to the | ↓i+ | ↓i
threshold. These channels are dipole-coupled, leading to
in the ﬁgure.
an avoided curve crossing at R = 60 a.u.
The resulting potential curve, labeled Vb in Figure 1(a),
is deep enough to hold a set of quasi-bound states of the
[OH]∗
2 dimer. (Note that this curve was denoted “U0”
in Ref. [24]. Here we label it more consistently with the
theory of photoassociation, to which we refer below.)

The potential Vb, and its bound states, are strongly
subject to the strength of the applied electric ﬁeld E.
First, changes in E shift the relative thresholds, chang-
ing the location of the crossing point. Second, the cou-
pling matrix element between the channels that cross
to form Vb varies with ﬁeld as ∼ k/(1 + k2), where
k = 2µE/Λ(0), and µ and Λ(0) are the molecule’s dipole
moment and zero-ﬁeld Lambda-doublet splitting, respec-
tively [24]. This means that in low ﬁeld the crossing is
purely diabatic, to lowest order, and the molecules can
approach to small values of R where hydrogen bonding
and chemical forces can act.

That the ﬁeld controls these states is illustrated in Fig-
ure 2. Here the binding energies of potential Vb are plot-
ted as a function of electric ﬁeld E, from zero to 104
V/cm. The solid lines refer to a close-coupling calcula-
tion in the six-channel model, whereas the dashed lines
give the bound state energies of the adiabatic potential
Vb. Similar results are obtained in the more complete
calculation described in Ref. [24]. A striking feature of
this ﬁgure is that for ﬁelds below ∼ 1000 V/cm there are
no bound states at all, because the potential becomes too
shallow. Because of the essential role the ﬁeld plays in
creating these states, we refer to them as “ﬁeld linked”
states.

The ﬁeld-linked (FL) states remain coupled to chan-
nels with lower-energy thresholds, and can therefore pre-
dissociate to these channels. For several selected ﬁeld
values the energy widths for predissociation, computed
from the eigenphase sums in the close-coupling calcula-
tion, are indicated by error bars on the energies. Two
general trends are readily apparent: ﬁrst, the widths as a
whole become exponentially narrower as the binding en-
ergy approaches threshold; second, there is an additional
ﬁeld-dependent modulation in the widths, governed by
the varying overlap integrals between the resonant states
and the continua into which they decay.

The dominance of the electric ﬁeld over the FL states
implies that ultracold molecular collisions can be ma-
nipulated. For example, resonant control over scattering
lengths in | ↓i+ | ↓i collisions is possible by tuning bound
states of Vb through the scattering threshold [24]. A sim-
ilar tuning was noted for alkali atoms in extremely strong
electric ﬁelds [27], but without making the explicit con-
nection to bound states.

The FL states also imply a degree of control over chem-

ical reactions. For example, placing two OH molecules in
a FL state holds them at a “safe” distance where the
reaction cannot occur (assuming for example that the
exoergic reaction OH + OH → H2O + O actually occurs
at ultralow temperatures). The reaction can then be ac-
tivated at will by switching oﬀ the ﬁeld, which could
be done at any desired rate simply by varying the ﬁeld
strength.

FIG. 2. Binding energies of bound states in the potential
Vb versus electric ﬁeld. Solid lines: close-coupling results.

bars: approximate predissociation widths, as computed form
the eigenphase sums in the close-coupling calculations.

FL states can presumably be created from a gas of | ↓i
molecules by quickly ramping the electric ﬁeld, just as
bound states of Rb2 have been created in magnetic ﬁeld
ramps [11]. Setting the ﬁeld to an appropriate value will
guarantee that the state created will be long-lived against
predissociation. It is also possible that they have been
produced already by collisions in the supersonic expan-
sion that feeds the Stark slowing process [22], although
they have not yet been sought in this environment.

As a practical issue, a gas of molecules in the weak-
electric-ﬁeld-seeking | ↓i state is subject to large colli-
sional losses in an electric ﬁeld and is therefore not suit-
able for evaporative cooling [24]. The | ↑i state, on the
other hand, is collisionally stable, being the lowest energy
state of the OH molecule, and it can be trapped in either
a magnetostatic or an oﬀ-resonant optical dipole trap.
Adiabatic curves correlating to the | ↑i+ | ↑i threshold
do not experience a curve crossing at large R, and allow
the molecules to approach to small values of R (see Fig.
1). The cold collision parameters, for instance the scat-
tering length, will then have to be measured in a suitable
experiment.

We are therefore led to consider photoassociation (PA)
spectroscopy of the molecular pair. This will be PA at
microwave, rather than optical, wavelengths, appropriate

3

to the energies of the FL states. We follow here the dis-
cussion of Ref. [26], and consider single-channel processes
only. This will enable order-of magnitude estimates of the
multichannel response. The PA process may be viewed
as a scattering event, where two molecules incident in
channel V0 with relative energy E are promoted by a mi-
crowave photon of detuning ∆ to a FL state in potential
Vb. This state can then predissociate, typically releas-
ing a large fraction of the photon’s energy and leading
to trap loss in the exit channel. The rate constant for
collisional trap loss via a bound state in potential Vb is
given by [26]

Kloss =

πv
k2

γΓ
(E − ∆)2 + ((γ + Γ)/2)2 ,

where v and k are the relative incident velocity and wave
number, γ is the predissociation width, and the stimu-
lated width Γ is given by the Fermi’s Golden Rule ex-
pression

Γ = 2π|hf0|Vrad|φbi|2.

Here Vrad =< −~µ·~Eac > is the R-dependent dipole matrix
element for the transition, averaged over all coordinates
except R [28]. Eac is the amplitude of the ac electric ﬁeld
of the applied microwaves, which we assume are polarized
parallel to the dc ﬁeld. The width (1) also depends on
f0(R), the energy-normalized incident wave function, and
φb(R), the unit-normalized bound state wave function in
potential Vb. On resonance, and in the typical case Γ ≪ γ
the rate is approximately

hence is proportional to the microwave intensity.

Measurements of optical PA spectra have proven use-
ful in assessing the scattering lengths of alkali atoms [29],
largely because the overlap integral in (2) is sensitive to
the amplitude of the wave function f0 at the intermolec-
ular distance Rc where the transition occurs.
In fact,
this circumstance enables PA rates to be estimated using
a “reﬂection approximation” that focuses on the wave
functions at R = Rc alone [30]. The FL states should ex-
hibit a similar sensitivity to scattering length, although
now the R-dependence of the dipole coupling Vrad cannot
be neglected, as seen in Figure 1(b). In the limit of large
R, Vrad tends to zero, owing to the inability of a single
photon to drive a transition of both molecules at once.
At smaller values of R, where the avoided crossing occurs
that creates Vb, the radiative coupling attains a nonzero
value.

To illustrate the feasibility of PA experiments in this
system, and to emphasize the strong sensitivity of the
spectra to electric ﬁeld and scattering length, we estimate
rate constants for several diﬀerent circumstances. These
results are summarized in Table I. In all cases we have
assumed that the ac microwave ﬁeld has a ﬁeld strength

D
of Eac = 15 V/cm, which can be reasonably achieved in
the laboratory [31]. We have computed the resonant PA
rate according to Eqn. (1), assuming two diﬀerent short-
range potentials that produce the scattering lengths a =
69 a.u. and a = −400 a.u.
in the incident V0 ground
channel, in zero electric ﬁeld. The collision energy is 100
µK in the results shown here.

The Tables show, for several values of the dc elec-
tric ﬁeld E, the binding energy of several states; their
predissociation widths γ; their stimulated widths Γ for
each of the scattering lengths; and the resonant loss rate
Kloss, again for both scattering lengths. The table illus-
trates that a fairly small ﬁeld change, on the order of
1 kV/cm, can completely alter the loss rates. Moreover,
the rates are diﬀerent for diﬀerent scattering lengths, im-
plying sensitivity to details of the short-range part of V0.
A complete map of loss versus ﬁeld ought therefore to
contain a wealth of information about cold collisions of
OH molecules. Equally importantly, the absolute mag-
nitudes of the loss rates can be quite large, as high as
several 10−11 cm3/sec, which should be easily measur-
able if densities are high enough for molecular collisions
to be observed at all.

In summary, we have introduced a set of weakly-bound
“ﬁeld-linked” states of ultracold polar molecules that ex-
ist only in the presence of an electric ﬁeld. The sensitivity
of these states to electric ﬁeld suggests an unprecedented
level of control over intermolecular forces, since the very
shape of the interaction potential can be manipulated. In
addition, their purely long-range character makes them
invaluable tools for approaching the diﬃcult problem of
deciphering ultracold molecular collisions.

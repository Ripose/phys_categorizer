(Dated: December 31, 2013)

Aided by ultra-high resolution spectroscopy, the overall systematic uncertainty of the 1S0-3P0
clock resonance for lattice-conﬁned 87Sr has been characterized to 9 × 10−16. This uncertainty is
at a level similar to the Cs-fountain primary standard, while the potential stability for the lattice
clocks exceeds that of Cs. The absolute frequency of the clock transition has been measured to
−15 fractional uncertainty represents the most
be 429,228,004,229,874.0(1.1) Hz, where the 2.5 × 10
accurate measurement of a neutral-atom-based optical transition frequency to date.

The signiﬁcant advances in femtosecond comb tech-
nology [1, 2, 3] in the past decade have sparked immense
interest in atomic clocks based on optical transitions [4].
These transitions have large line quality factors (Q) [5, 6],
which will provide orders of magnitude improvement in
clock stability over state-of-the-art microwave clocks. An
optical clock based on a single trapped Hg+ ion has re-
cently surpassed Cs fountain clocks [7, 8] in terms of ac-
curacy, with clock systematics reduced to 7 × 10−17 [9].
Other high accuracy ion standards include Sr+ [10, 11]
and Yb+ [12]. The high line Q allows a stability compara-
ble to the best achieved thus far with Cs, despite the fact
that the single-ion signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ) is drasti-
cally reduced compared to microwave systems which typ-
ically employ ∼105 atoms. Optical lattice clocks show
promise for reaching a level of accuracy comparable to the
ion systems, with signiﬁcantly improved stability due to
the large number of atoms involved in the measurement.
This stability gain has spurred an intensive investigation
of lattice clocks based on spin-forbidden transitions in
alkaline-earth atoms, speciﬁcally in Sr [5, 13, 14, 15, 16]
and Yb [17, 18], where the trapping potential is designed
to allow accurate measurements eﬀectively free of both
ac Stark shifts [13, 19, 20] and motional eﬀects which
can hamper optical clocks based on atoms in free space
[21, 22, 23].

While the clock-stability beneﬁts provided by the op-
tical lattice method are now clear [5, 18], reaching the
accuracy level of the microwave standards remains a
paramount issue in the ﬁeld. Recently, great strides to-
wards this goal have been taken, as a troublesome 4σ
disagreement between the ﬁrst two high accuracy exper-
iments using 87Sr [14, 15] has been resolved by a third
independent investigation [16], and a revised report by
the authors of Ref. [14] published shortly thereafter [24].
Agreement between the three groups speaks strongly for
the lattice clock as a future candidate for redeﬁnition of
the SI second; however, to be competitive with the cur-
rent Cs fountain clocks the overall systematics must be
reduced well below the 10−15 level.

In this Letter, we report a detailed study of the system-
atic uncertainty associated with the 87Sr 1S0-3P0 clock
transition frequency at the level of 9 × 10−16. This

FIG. 1: (color online) High resolution spectroscopy of the
1S0-3P0 transition.
(a) A Fourier-limited resonance proﬁle
for typical operating parameters in the experiment. A sinc2
ﬁt is shown in red, giving a linewidth (FWHM) of 10.6(3) Hz
(Q ≃ 4 × 1013). (b) Spectroscopy of an isolated nuclear spin
component yields a linewidth of 1.9(2) Hz (Q ≃ 2.3 × 1014),
consistent with the 1.8 Hz Fourier limit for the 0.48 s probe
time. The spectra in both (a) and (b) are taken without
averaging or normalization, and the vertical axes are scaled
by the total number of atoms (2 × 104). The S/N in (a) is
limited by shot to shot atom number ﬂuctuation, whereas the
probe laser frequency noise is the dominant eﬀect in (b).

measurement, aided mainly by the record level line Q
achieved recently [5], shows that the Sr lattice clock can
reach an accuracy level competitive with Cs fountains,
while the potential stability for the system is far greater.
An absolute frequency measurement of the transition is
also reported with an uncertainty of 2.5 × 10−15, limited
by a Cs-calibrated NIST H-maser reference.

Full details of the cooling and trapping system used in
this work are discussed elsewhere [15, 25]. In brief, 87Sr
atoms are captured from a thermal beam into a magneto-
optical trap (MOT) based on the 1S0-1P1 cycling transi-
tion. Second stage cooling, using a dual frequency 1S0-
3P1 MOT [26], is performed concurrently with the load-
ing of a vertical one-dimensional lattice, yielding ∼2 ×
104 atoms at a temperature of 1.5 µK. The lattice is op-
erated at the Stark cancelation wavelength [20] with an
intensity I0 = 5 kW/cm2 (83% of which forms the stand-
ing wave due to window losses), resulting in measured
longitudinal and radial trap frequencies of 40 kHz and
125 Hz respectively. The atoms are distributed over ∼80
lattice sites with a density ρ0 = 5×1011 cm−3. The spec-
troscopy sequence for the 1 mHz 1S0-3P0 clock transition

begins with a Rabi pulse from a highly stabilized diode
laser [27] that is co-propagated and co-polarized with the
lattice laser. With some atoms shelved in the 3P0 state,
the remaining 1S0 population is removed from the lat-
tice by exciting the 1S0-1P1 transition. The 3P0 atoms
are then driven back to the ground state, by pumping
through intermediate states, and the population is mea-
sured by again driving the 1S0-1P1 transition and detect-
ing scattered photons. This process is repeated each time
atoms are loaded into the lattice, as the laser frequency
is tuned. The time window for the Rabi pulse is varied
within 40-480 ms depending on the desired Fourier width
(22-1.8 Hz).

The 1S0 (F =9/2) - 3P0 (F =9/2) transition, facilitated
by nuclear-spin induced state mixing [28], suﬀers from a
diﬀerential Land´e g-factor between the clock states, with
the 3P0 sensitivity being ∼60% larger than that of the
ground state. The resultant Zeeman shift of -109 Hz/(G
mF ) [5] (1 G = 10−4 T) can be a limitation in terms
of the achievable accuracy and line Q in the presence
of magnetic ﬁelds. Figure 1(a) shows a spectrum for a
80 ms probe time, representing the parameters typically
used in the work reported here, yielding a FWHM (full
width at half maximum) linewidth of 10.6(3) Hz. The
spectrum shown here supports a clock instability of less
than 3×10−15 at 1 s. For atom-shot-noise limited spectra
of the same width, and reasonable improvements to the
duty cycle, the number could be reduced by more than
an order of magnitude. The narrowest resonances have so
far been achieved when a resolved nuclear sublevel is used
for spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 1(b). Here, linewidth
limitations from magnetic ﬁelds or state-dependent Stark
shifts are eliminated, and widths below 2 Hz are repeat-
ably observed.

As a general approach for evaluating systematics, an
interleaved scheme is used where the parameter of inter-
est is cycled through diﬀerent values, synchronized with
each frequency step of the probe laser across the reso-

2

nance. The interleaved data is then separated into reso-
nance proﬁles for each parameter value, allowing the cen-
ter frequency (relative to the laser cavity), and more im-
portantly the slope of the frequency shift, to be measured
for a variety of system parameters in a short time. This
method allows us to measure shifts against the probe
laser, which has a stability superior to our available mi-
crowave reference [27].

Of the many eﬀects to be characterized for an opti-
cal lattice clock, the eﬀect of the lattice laser itself re-
mains a focal point. The diﬀerential light shifts of the
clock states due to the scalar, vector, and tensor polar-
izabilities all vary linearly with trap intensity and can
be strongly suppressed with an appropriate choice of lat-
tice wavelength [17, 19]. Higher-order Stark shifts, due
to the hyperpolarizability of the clock states, are negli-
gibly small (< 10−17)[20] at our operating intensity and
wavelength. Hence, a linear extrapolation to the zero-
intensity clock frequency is suﬃcient to characterize the
total Stark shift from all contributors mentioned above.
An example of this is shown in Fig. 2(a) where four dif-
ferent values of the lattice intensity are interleaved dur-
ing a trace taking less than one minute. Using 2, 4, or
8 lattice intensity values, 776 interleaved measurements
revealed that for a wavelength λ0 = 813.4280(5) nm, the
Stark shift is -108(257) mHz/I0. A summary of the lat-
tice Stark shift measurements is shown in Fig 2(b) as a
histogram, along with a gaussian ﬁt of the data.

The eﬀect of atomic density on the transition frequency
is explored in a similar fashion as densities ranging within
(0.2-1)ρ0 are interleaved (by varying the number of atoms
in the MOT). A histogram of 422 measurements of the
density eﬀect is shown in Fig. 2(c), resulting in a shift
coeﬃcient of 3(140) mHz/ρ0. Notably the upper limit
of the density-related fractional frequency shift of 5.6 ×
10−28 cm−3 is ∼106 times smaller than for Cs [7, 8].

The ten nuclear-spin sublevels of the clock transition
result in systematic eﬀects related to magnetic and op-
tical ﬁelds. For example, the asymmetric distribution of
population among the sublevels can be a central system-
atic issue when using unpolarized atomic samples, as any
mF -dependent magnetic or optical interaction can cause
a frequency shift, even if the sub-levels are shifted sym-
metrically about the center. The diﬀerential g-factor of
the clock states provides the most signiﬁcant eﬀect as
it leads to a sensitivity to magnetic ﬁelds of nearly 500
Hz/G for the stretched states. Three orthogonal sets of
Helmholtz coils are used to characterize frequency shifts
caused by the Zeeman sensitivity of the nuclear-spin sub-
levels. Figure 3 summarizes the characterization of mag-
netic ﬁeld eﬀects along one of these three axes. For each
direction, the transition linewidth is used to ﬁnd the ﬁeld
minimum as shown in Fig. 3(a). The narrow 10 Hz res-
onances allow the ﬁeld zero to be constrained within 10
mG for each axis. Frequency shift sensitivity is explored
using the interleaved scheme with the results for the fea-

tured axis shown in Fig. 3(b). Here the average val-
ues for 112 measurements are shown, yielding a slope of
26(4) Hz/G. Similar measurements were performed for
the other two axes yielding 22(7) Hz/G and 12(3) Hz/G.
The ﬁelds for the three axes are zeroed below 5, 5, and
10 mG respectively, resulting in a total Zeeman uncer-
tainty of 5.3 × 10−16. This gives insight into the minimal
eﬀect of the vector light shift which causes symmetric
mF -dependent shifts proportional to the degree of lattice
ellipticity and trapping intensity [17, 19]. The resultant
splitting for the stretched states is estimated as less than
8 (Hz/rad)/I0. To combat this eﬀect, a high extinction
polarizer (>104) is used for the lattice and probe beam,
and while the vacuum chamber windows likely reduce the
purity of the linear polarization, rotations of even a few
degrees are equivalent to a sub mG residual ﬁeld, attest-
ing to the insigniﬁcance of this eﬀect compared to the
diﬀerential g-factor.

Systematics related to the probe laser were considered
in two respects. First, the probe can cause Stark shifts
of the clock states by coupling to external levels. Second,
asymmetric motional sidebands could cause line pulling.
This eﬀect is minimal as the sidebands are well resolved
(even the radial sidebands are detuned by more than ten
times the transition width) and are only observed for
large probe intensities. These eﬀects were checked exper-
imentally by varying the probe power by more than an or-
der of magnitude during 77 measurements. To eliminate
Stark shifts from other sources, all lasers used for cooling,
trapping, and detection are switched with both acousto-

optic modulators and mechanical shutters. Shifts from
black body radiation (BBR) are also considered [29], in-
cluding the eﬀect of a nearby heated vacuum window.

Table I summarizes the dominant systematic uncer-
tainties for spectroscopy of the clock transition, reported
in terms of fractional frequency. A total uncertainty of
0.88×10−15 is achieved, representing the ﬁrst experimen-
tal veriﬁcation that the lattice technique can reach inac-
curacies below the 10−15 level, comparable with Cs foun-
tains. The largest uncertainties are limited by technical
issues such as a small dynamic range on the lattice inten-
sity and sensitivity to stray magnetic ﬁelds. Future work
using isolated spin states should allow orders of magni-
tude reduction in the nuclear-spin related shifts, while
signiﬁcant reductions in the lattice shift uncertainty can
be achieved using a larger range of intensities. Spin-
polarizing the atoms can also minimize collision shifts via
Fermi suppression. However, unless the spin polarization
is pure and all atoms are in a single motional state of the
trap (possible but not yet achieved in a lattice clock), the
collision shift must still be evaluated experimentally.

To measure the absolute frequency of the 1S0 - 3P0
transition, a Cs-fountain-calibrated H-maser is used to
stabilize a radio frequency synthesizer located at NIST.
The synthesizer modulates the amplitude of a 1320 nm
laser, which is transferred to JILA via a ∼4 km ﬁber link
[30, 31]. The modulation frequency of 950 MHz is com-
pared to the repetition rate of a femtosecond frequency
comb locked to the spectroscopy laser. The maser and
transfer system provide a 1 s instability of 2.5 × 10−13,
and for the work reported here, the maser is calibrated to
1.7 × 10−15. Passive transfer using the ﬁber link has been
found to introduce frequency oﬀsets as large as 1×10−14,
speciﬁcally related to periodic stretching and compress-
ing of the ﬁber length owing to daily temperature varia-
tions. To eliminate this eﬀect, the ﬁber length is stabi-
lized using a ﬁber stretcher controlled by comparison of
the local microwave phase at NIST with that of modu-
lated light reﬂected back from JILA. While in-loop mea-
surements show the frequency transfer is stabilized to a
few parts in 1017, we assign a conservative uncertainty
of 1 × 10−16 to account for other potential errors [32].
The reference synthesizer for the transfer can also cause
frequency errors [33] as drifts in the synthesizer’s temper-
ature result in fractional shifts at the level of 4 × 10−14

A summary of 880 absolute frequency measurements
spanning a full 24 hour period is shown in Fig. 4(a).
Each point corresponds to a 30 second measurement of an
11 Hz spectrum with a frequency uncertainty of ∼20 Hz,
consistent with the Allan deviation of the H-Maser. The
data averages down with gaussian statistics, as shown
in Fig. 4(b) and in the histogram of Fig. 4(c). Dur-
ing the measurement, the Sr chamber temperature was
continuously monitored, and the magnetic ﬁeld was re-
peatedly calibrated (Fig. 3(c)) both by monitoring tran-
sition linewidths and by employing the zeroing technique

in Fig. 3(a). Table II summarizes the relevant correc-
tions and uncertainties associated with the absolute fre-
quency measurement. The only signiﬁcant corrections
not determined by direct frequency measurements here
are the BBR shift and the gravitational shift arising from
the diﬀerence in elevation of the NIST Cs fountain and
the JILA Sr lattice. The frequency of the 1S0-3P0 tran-
sition is 429,228,004,229,874.0(1.1) Hz, with the uncer-
tainty mainly limited by the maser calibration. Figure
4(d) shows that this value agrees well with recent reports
from the SYRTE [16] and Tokyo [24] groups as well as
with our original value [15]. The ﬁnal absolute frequency
uncertainty of 2.5×10−15 corresponds to the most accu-
rate optical frequency measurement for neutral atoms to
date, and falls short of only the recent Hg+ ion result [9]
as the most accurate optical measurement in any system.

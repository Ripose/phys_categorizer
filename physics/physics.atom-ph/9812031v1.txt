Abstract

−

We present results on the stability of quantum systems consisting of a nega-
q1 with mass m1 and two positive charges q2 and q3, with masses
tive charge
m2 and m3, respectively. We show that, for given masses mi, each instability
domain is convex in the plane of the variables (q1/q2, q1/q3). A new proof
is given of the instability of muonic ions (α, p, µ−). We then study stability
q2: stability is sometimes restricted to
in some critical regimes where q3 ≪
large values of some mass ratios; the behaviour of the stability frontier is
established to leading order in q3/q2. Finally we present some conjectures
about the shape of the stability domain, both for given masses and varying
charges, and for given charges and varying masses.

In two previous papers [1, 2], hereafter referred to as I and II, respectively,
we studied the stability of quantum systems consisting of point-like electric
charges

In I, we considered the case of unit charges qi = 1, with application to
+(e−pp), H−(pe−e−) and Ps−(e+e−e−), which
physical systems such as H2
are stable, or (e−pe+) which is unbound. We pointed out simple properties
of the stability domain, leading to a uniﬁed presentation of results already
known [3], and to a number of new results. For instance, if m is the largest
proton mass which gives a stable (e−, e+, p) system when associated to a
positron and an electron both of mass me = 1, it is found in I that m < 4.2,
a signiﬁcant improvement over previous bounds [3]. This means that global
considerations on the stability domain can sometimes complement speciﬁc
studies adapted to particular mass conﬁgurations.

In II, we extended the discussion by letting the charges qi themselves
vary. The number of parameters is increased from two to four, and one can
choose two mass ratios and two charge ratios. The general properties of the
stability domain established in II will be brieﬂy reviewed, and supplemented
by new results. This will be the subject of Sec. 2.

As an example of application of general considerations on the stability
domain, we shall present in Sec. 3 a new proof that muonic ions involving
a helium nucleus α, such as (p, α, µ−) or (d, α, µ−), are not stable. This
conﬁrms results [4] obtained previously using the Born–Oppenheimer frame-
work.

In II, we also considered the limiting case where q3 →

0, but only in the
Born–Oppenheimer case where m2 = m3 =
. We shall resume in Sec. 4 our
investigations and study the behaviour of the stability frontier in the case
where q2 & 1 and q3 ≪
In Sec. 5, we shall present some speculations about the plausible shape
of the stability domain in both representations: varying charge-ratios for
given masses, or varying masses for given charges. A number of interesting
questions remain open.

Our rigorous results are supplemented by numerical investigations based
on a variational approximation to the solution of the 3-body Schr¨odinger
equation. In particular, we display an estimate of the domain of stability in
the (q2, q3) plane for some given sets of constituent masses.

2 General properties of the stability domain

2.1

Inverse-mass plane for unit charges

Consider ﬁrst the case where q1 = q2 = q3, which can be chosen as qi = 1.
Stability is deﬁned as the existence of a normalised 3-body bound state with
an energy below that of the lowest (1,2) or (1,3) atom, i.e.,

E(3) < min

1i =

(α1 + αi)−1/2,

−

(3)

where αi = 1/mi is the inverse mass of particle i. Thanks to scaling, there
are only two independent mass ratios in this problem.
In I, we found it
convenient to represent any possible system as a point inside the triangle of
3
i=1 αi = 1. This triangular plot is shown in
inverse masses normalised by
Fig. 1.

P

In this representation, the stability domain appears as a band around the

symmetry axis where α2 = α3. It is schematically pictured in Fig. 1.

from A2 crosses at most once the stability frontier between A2 and the sym-

in the discussion, is given by

It is a straight line in both pictures, i.e., for ﬁxed charges qi in the plane of
inverse masses, and in the charge plane for ﬁxed masses.

One expects an increase of stability near (T), where both thresholds be-
come equal. This is what happens in the unit-charge case where, according
to Hill’s theorem [5], we have stability for α2 = α3. Another example is the
Born–Oppenheimer limit with m2 = m3 =
, and say m1 = q1 = 1 to ﬁx
∞
the scales: in the (q2, q3) plane, it is observed that the stability domain does
not extend much beyond the unit square (q2 ≤
1), except for a spike
1.24 [6]. This is shown in
around the q2 = q3 axis, which reaches q2 = q3 ≃
Fig. 2.

For ﬁxed charged qi, the triangular plot of Fig. 1 can be used again. The
threshold separation (T) is a straight line passing through the (unphysical)
1, α2 = α3 = 1, which is the mirror image of A1 with respect to
point α1 =
A2A3. As seen in II, each instability domain remains star shaped and convex,

−

3

as in the case of unit charges. In particular, if q3 < q2 and q3 < 1, the entire
sub-triangle limited by (T) and A2 corresponds to stability. If furthermore
q2 < 1, then we have stability everywhere.

Following a suggestion by Gribov [7], one can also consider level lines of

constant relative binding, i.e., such that

E(2)

12 < E(2)

13

and E(3)/E(2)

12 = λ > 1.

(6)

(Remember that both E(3) and E(2)
the domain E(3)/E(2)
where we set E(3) = E(2)

12 are negative.) What happens is that
12 < λ (including the case where particle 3 is unbound,

12 ) is also convex and star shaped.
The proof is essentially the same as for the domain of instability. One
ﬁrst rescales the αi from α1 + α2 + α3 = 1 to α1 + α2 = 1, so that the
threshold energy E(2)
12 becomes constant. If two points ~α = (α1, α2, α3) and
1, α′
~α′ = (α′

3) belong to the frontier of interest, that is to say

2, α′

E(3)(~α) = E(3)(~α′) = λE(2)
12 ,

(7)

then as the αi enter the Hamiltonian linearly, for any intermediate point

Similarly, a decrease of α3 with α1 and α2 kept constant cannot do anything
but decrease E(3) with E(2)
12 unchanged: this proves the star-shape behaviour.

We return to the domain of strict instability, but now for ﬁxed masses mi
and variables charges. We ﬁx q1 = 1 and consider the frontier of stability in
the (1/q2, 1/q3) plane.

First, we notice that the domain of stability is star-shaped with respect

If m2 < m3, the threshold separation (T) has a slope larger than unity
in the (1/q2, 1/q3) plane. If m2 > m3, this is the reverse. Consider now for
deﬁniteness the domain where

2 (α1 + α3) > q2

3 (α1 + α2) .

(9)

In this domain, the (1,2) atom is more bound than (1,3) and it is the energy
of (1,2) to which E(3) should be compared. The ground-state energy E(3) of

the Hamiltonian (2) is separately and globally concave in q12, q23 and q23.
With our choice of the charges we have

q12 = q2,

q23 = q2q3,

but we can make a rescaling taking

¯q12 = 1,

¯q13 =

¯q23 = q3.

,

In this way, the binding energy of (1,2) is ﬁxed. As E(3) is a concave function
of ¯q13 and ¯q23, the instability domain is convex in the (¯q13, ¯q23) plane. This
means a segment of straight line

(cid:18)

joining two points of the domain also belongs to the domain. But this equa-
tion translates into

and thus also represents a straight line in the (1/q2, 1/q3) plane. Thus each
instability domain is convex in this plane. This is schematically pictured in
Fig. 3.

3 Instability of (α, p, µ−) systems

The problem of the instability of ions such as (α, p, µ−), (α, d, e−), etc., has
been considered by several authors. What has been shown is essentially that,
within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, the eﬀective (α, p) or (α, d)
potential is unable to support a bound state [4]. The proof below is more
general, for none of the masses is assumed to be very large.

First we notice that for equal charges q2 = q3 > 1.24 [6] the 3-body system
is unstable for equal masses α2 = α3, because it is unstable for α2 = α3 = 0
and α2 = α3 = 1/2, and the domain of instability with respect to a given
threshold is convex in the triangle of inverse masses.

Furthermore, using for instance the (q2, q3) plane and keeping the masses
equal and constant, we know that the system is unstable for a ﬁxed q2 > 1.24
and q3 very small, because particle 3 is almost free and because the system
(1,2) is repulsive. So using convexity in q3 for ﬁxed q2, we prove that the
system is unstable for 0 < q3 < q2, if q2 > 1.24, for α2 = α3.

Therefore, if α2 = α3, a system with q2 = 2 and q3 = 1 is unstable. But
, we

the system (1, 2) is repulsive and for α1 = α2 = 0, i.e., m1 = m2 =
have instability. Now, in the left half-triangle α2 ≤

so that it is the (1, 2) system which is more negatively bound. Therefore,
we can use the star-shape instability in the whole left half-triangle, which
includes not only αpµ− or αpe−, but also αdµ− or αtµ−. Notice that the
proof does not work for q2 > q3, m3 > m2.

4 Some limiting conﬁgurations

4.1 The very asymmetric Born–Oppenheimer case

In II the case was considered where the masses m2 and m3 are both inﬁnite,
but the corresponding charges q2 and q3 are freely varying. The stability
domain is shown in Fig. 2, with a normalisation q1 = 1. The domain is of
course symmetric under (q2 ↔

1.24. The frontier

corrections diﬀer only by terms with higher power of (

ln q3).

−

4.2 The Born–Oppenheimer approximation for m1 and

m2 very large, q1 = q2 = 1

We now consider systems analogous to (p, ¯p, e−).
In the limit of strictly
q1 acting on the charge
inﬁnite masses, we have a point source of charge q2 −
q3 > 0. Thus there is no binding if q2 > q1 and binding for q2 < q1. So, a
non-trivial case consists of m1 and m2 very large but ﬁnite, and q1 = q2 = 1.
We argue below that binding is unlikely if m3q3 is very small.

For q2 < 1, the potential in (28) exhibits an asymptotic Coulomb be-
H 1 supports bound states whatever inverse
haviour which is attractive. Thus
mass α3/q3 is involved. We recover the property seen in (II) that for q3 < 1
and q2 < 1, the 3-body system is stable for any choice of the constituent
masses.

e

For q2 ≥

1, the potential in (28) has a repulsive Coulomb tail or decreases
exponentially. At best, it oﬀers a short-range pocket of attraction to trap
the charge q3. The short-range character is governed by the exponential in
the form factor f , as per Eq. (28). Such a potential supports a bound state
provided the mass q3/α3 is large enough, say q3/α3 > µc. This is why at the
frontier α3 =

(q3).

Calculating the critical mass µc accurately as a function of q2 is a routine
numerical work. One can for instance integrate the radial equation at zero
energy and look at whether or not a node occurs in the radial wave-function
at ﬁnite distance. The result is shown in Fig. 4.

4.5 The small q3 limit in the (q2, q3) plane

Let us consider now the (q2, q3) plane (with q1 = 1) for ﬁxed masses. The
shape of the stability domain is shown in Fig. 6. The frontier of stability
leaves the unit square at some ﬁnite value of q3. Consider, indeed, q2 = 1,
with α1 = 0 for simplicity, and a mass scale ﬁxed at α2 = 1. In a (variational)
approximation of a (1,2) atom times a function describing the motion of the
third particle, we can read the calculation of Sec. 4.3 as

1 > q3 > µc(1)α3 ≃

1.10α3

being a suﬃcient condition for stability.

A necessary condition of the same type, i.e., q3 > ˜µcα3 can be obtained

using the method of Glaser et al. [10]. The decomposition

Figure 6: Shape of the stability domain in the (q2, q3) plane. The frontier
of stability leaves the vertical side q2 = 1 of the unit square at some ﬁnite
value of q3. It also leaves the horizontal line q3 = 1 at some ﬁnite value of
q2, which can either smaller (as in this ﬁgure) or larger than 1.

where x = q2r3, in the variable ~r3. For q2 = 1, this potential supports
a bound-state provided q3 > ˜µcα3, with ˜µc > 0.34 from the Jost–Pais–
0.64 from a numerical calculation (looking
Bargmann rule [12], and ˜µc ≃
for nodes in the radial wave function at zero energy).

If α1 > 0, a reasoning similar to that of Subsec. 4.4 shows that the

suﬃcient condition (40) is replaced by

q3 > µc(1)(α1 + α3)

1.10(α1 + α3),

(44)

≃

where the normalisation is α1 + α2 + α3 = 1.

The result (44) is of course expected to be better if the computed q3 is

small, i.e., if α1 + α3 ≪

1.

4.6 Frontier in the (q2, q3) plane at small α3/α2

We remain in the (q2, q3) plane for ﬁxed masses. We assume α1 = 0 for
simplicity, but some results do not depend on this assumption. We can
normalise to α2 = 1. In the limit where α3 is small, the threshold separation
(T), as given by Eq. (25), has a very small slope with respect to the q3 axis.
The frontier exits out of the unit square at q2 = 1 and a ﬁnite value of
q3 which is close to α3µc(1), where µc(1)
1.10, according to our previous
computation. If we look at the frontier outside the unit square, we have two
questions:

≃

i) in the lower part of the plot, is the frontier strictly below (T) ?

13

ii) in the upper part, does the frontier overcome the line q3 = 1 ?

4.6.1 Lower part of the frontier

To answer the ﬁrst question, let us consider a situation where q3 is close to
α−1/2
but smaller than 1, and thus q2 ∼
is large. If particles 2 and 3 would
3
ignore each other, they would bind around particle 1 with approximately
the same energy, since we are close to (T), but with diﬀerent Bohr radii Ri,
namely R3/R2 ∼
1. This suggests the approximation of a localised
(1,3) source attracting the charge q2, corresponding to a 3-body energy

4.6.2 Upper part

∞

We now turn to the question of possible binding above the line q3 = 1. We
restrict ourselves to m1 =
, although we suspect that our results are more
general. Numerical investigations using the method described in Appendix B
suggest the following pattern. For m2 = m3, a spike is observed on the
diagonal. It reaches about q2 = q3 = 1.24 in Fig. 2, corresponding to m2 =
m3 =
m1. The spike
remains for moderate values of the mass ratio m3/m2, as schematically shown
in Fig. 6. When, however, m3/m2 exceeds a value which is about 1.8, no spike
is seen within the accuracy of our calculations, i.e., the frontier seemingly
coincides with the line q3 = 1, until it reaches (T), as pictured in Fig. 8.

, and about q2 = q3 = 1.098 [13] for m2 = m3 ≪

∞

We are able to show rigorously below that, for large values of m3/m2
(3/4)1/2(m3/m2)1/2. Nothing can
no binding occurs above q3 = 1 for q2 ≤
be said however from this latter value to q2 = (m3/m2)1/2 on the threshold
separation (T). In other words, a very tiny peak along (T) overcoming q3 = 1
cannot be excluded.

4.7 Numerical results

We now display an estimate of the domain of stability in the (q2, q3) plane,
with normalisation q1 = 1. The method, described in Appendix B, is vari-
ational. Therefore, the approximate domain drawn here is included in the
true domain.

Our investigations correspond to m1 =

, and the mass ratio m3/m2
having the values 1, 1.1, 1.5 and 2. In each case, we show the whole domain,
and an enlargement of its most interesting part, the spike above q2 = 1 and
q3 = 1.

5 Outlook

Many questions remain open concerning the stability of 3-charge systems.
Along the paper, we pointed out that in some limiting cases, more accurate
results would be desirable. For instance, a question is whether very large
values of the mass ratio m3/m2 exclude the possibility of binding with q3 > 1.
There are also more general questions, concerning domains of some pa-
rameters for which stability will never be reached, whatever value is given to
the other parameters.

For given masses mi, the answer is immediate: there is always a set of

charges, for instance q3 < q2 < q1 = 1, that makes the system stable.

This upper bound for possible stability at m1 =

ring for at least some value of m2/m3) is not too far from the lower bound of
Fig. 13, obtained from our variational method. More extensive computations
would be necessary to sketch the shape of the domain of absolute instability,
in particular by relaxing the condition m1 =

In the r.h.s., the two ﬁrst terms are always positive, and so is the third one
if q−1

its expectation value is always positive, which means that

Appendix B: Variational method

We brieﬂy describe the variational method used for the numerical results
displayed in this paper. More details can be found in [15]. The ground state
of the Hamiltonian (2) has been searched using trial wave functions of the
type [16]

Ψ =

Ciϕi =

from which all matrix elements can be calculated in close form. The dots
are meant for similar terms obtained by permutation, in the case of identical
particles. For given range parameters, the weights Ci are listed in a vector

equation

involving the restrictions of the kinetic and potential energy to the space
spanned by the ϕi, whose scalar products are stored in the positive-deﬁnite
matrix

N.

As the number of terms increases, it quickly becomes impossible to deter-
mine the best range parameters, even with powerful minimization programs,
as too many neighboring sets give comparable energies. One way out [17]
consists of imposing all ai, bi and ci to be taken in a geometric series. Then
only the smallest and the largest have to be determined numerically. For
0.262005
instance, this method allows one to reproduce the binding energy
−
of the Ps− ion, in agreement with the best results in the literature.

The question now is to ﬁnd the frontier. Let us consider, for instance, the
3 when

, q1 = m2 = 1, and q2/q3 = m1/2
problem of Sec. 4.6.2. Here m1 =
∞
one searches the limit of stability among the threshold separation (T).

starting from some low value of q3, and examine, by suitable interpolation,
for which q3 it matches the threshold Ethe =

A more direct strategy consists to set E = Ethe in the Schr¨odinger equa-

using the same trial function (68), resulting in a matrix equation very similar
N now represents the restriction
to (69), where the positive-deﬁnite matrix
of m1/2
3 /r23 in the space of the ϕi. In principle, the variational wave function
needs not to be normalizable at threshold, but this becomes immaterial as
soon as very long range components are introduced in the expansion (68). It
was checked that the extrapolation method and the direct computation give
the same result for the frontier.

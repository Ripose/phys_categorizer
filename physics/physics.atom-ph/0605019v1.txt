Abstract.

We present the ﬁrst observation of ultracold LiCs molecules. The molecules
are formed in a two-species magneto-optical trap and detected by two-photon
ionization and time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry. The production rate coeﬃcient
is found to be in the range 10−18 cm3s−1 to 10−16 cm3s−1, at least an order
of magnitude smaller than for other heteronuclear diatomic molecules directly
formed in a magneto-optical trap.

Introduction

Owing to their permanent electric dipole moment, ultracold heteronuclear dimers
oﬀer many exciting possibilities for studies of interacting dipolar gases. At ultralow
temperatures the interaction energy of polar molecules in an electric ﬁeld can largely
exceed their thermal energy. Hence processes such as elastic and inelastic collisions
can be manipulated by applying electric ﬁelds [1, 2, 3, 4]. On the one hand, an
array of cold polar molecules has been proposed to represent a quantum computation
device, where each qubit is deﬁned by the orientation of a molecular dipole relative
to an external electric ﬁeld [5]. On the other hand, chemical reactions of polar
molecules at vanishing thermal energy have been proposed to be controllable by
suitable external electromagnetic ﬁelds [4, 6]. Despite the existence of potential energy
barriers, such reactions feature signiﬁcant rate coeﬃcients at low temperatures in the
Wigner threshold regime [7, 8].
Interesting complementary trapping concepts for
polar molecules are electrostatic [12, 13], magnetic [14] and microwave traps [15].
Experimentally, inelastic ultracold homonuclear atom-molecule collisions have been
studied in optical dipole traps [9, 10, 11].
Inelastic and elastic collisions involving
polar molecules are now open for similar investigations oﬀering new perspectives.

Large molecular electric dipole moments are required in order to make
experiments on dipole-dipole interactions and electric ﬁeld control of ultracold polar
molecules feasible. At the current state-of-the-art, heteronuclear alkali dimers seem to
be particularly suited. Such ultracold polar dimers can be formed by photoassociation
from ultracold samples of their atomic constituents as demonstrated for RbCs [21],
KRb [14, 22], and NaCs [23]. The dimer LiCs is predicted to have the largest
dipole moment of about 5.5 Debye for low lying vibrational states of the X1Σ+

electronic ground state [16, 17]. Recent theoretical studies demonstrate the possibility
for manipulating Li-Cs collisions [18], rovibrational dynamics of LiCs molecules [19],
binary inelastic collisions between KRb or RbCs [3] and implementing the mentioned
quantum computation proposal using optically trapped KRb or RbCs [20].

Here we present the ﬁrst observation of ultracold LiCs molecules. These are
formed out of an ultracold gas of Li and Cs atoms in two spatially overlapped
magneto-optical traps (MOTs). As observed in several experiments, homonuclear
[24, 25, 26] and heteronuclear [22, 23] alkali dimers can be formed ’directly’ in
the MOT, i.e., without applying a dedicated photoassociation laser. The molecule
formation is generally attributed to photoassociation induced by the trapping laser
light [27]; three-body recombination has also been conjectured as a possible cause for

light, a colliding atom pair is excited at long range to a molecular potential
which asymptotically correlates to one excited atom and one ground state atom.
Subsequently, the excited molecule decays into two free atoms or into the molecular
electronic ground state, thus forming an ultracold dimer in the latter process.
According to the semi-classical model by Wang and Stwalley [28] the probability for
the excitation step is proportional to the reduced mass of the molecule to the power
of 9/4, which yields a signiﬁcant reduction for LiCs as compared, e.g., to NaCs for

light-induced inelastic collisions between ground state Li and excited state Cs atoms
in a two-species MOT have been observed by our group as a source of substantial atom
loss already some years ago [29]. The loss is due to the large kinetic energy gained by
moving inwards on the excited state potential curve [30] and possibly partly due to
formation of LiCs molecules. In this work, using a dedicated scheme for the detection
of LiCs molecules in the electronic ground state, we show that ground state LiCs
molecules are indeed formed in a two-species MOT and we estimate their production
rate.

Two-species magneto-optical trap

The LiCs molecules are formed from Li and Cs atoms trapped in two overlapped
magneto-optical traps. The laser light for the Li MOT is provided by two injection
locked diode lasers (Philips, CQL-806), one detuned 20 MHz below the F=2 to F’=3
transition of the D2 line for cooling, the other tuned to the F=1 to F’=2 transition
for repumping. The two beams are combined on a beamsplitter. Three mutually
perpendicular and retroreﬂected beams (4 mW power in each horizontal beam and
twice the power in the vertical direction; 18 mm diameter), derived from the combined
beam, form the MOT. The Cs MOT is formed by one retroreﬂected beam in the
vertical direction and four pairwise counterpropagating beams in the horizontal plane.
Each horizontal beam has a power of 4 mW (twice as much for the vertical beam)
and a diameter of 16 mm. The cooling light is provided by a DBR laser diode (SDL-
5722-H1), which is locked 16 MHz to the red of the F=4 to F’=5 transition near
852 nm. A second diode laser (SDL-5712-H1) is used for repumping from the F=3
state. For optimizing the spatial overlap of the MOTs, the Li and Cs MOT laser
beams are adjusted separately while observing the ﬂuorescence light of both MOTs in
two perpendicular planes using two CCD cameras. The central part of the experiment
is sketched in Fig. 1.

Both MOTs are loaded from Zeeman slowed atomic beams coming out of a two-

species oven, which consists of two separate chambers connected by a capillary [31].
Each chamber can be heated separately and hence the ﬂux of the two atomic species
can be controlled independently. The front chamber containing Li is heated to 350◦C
while the rear chamber containing Cs has a temperature of 150◦C. The oven nozzle
and the capillary are kept at 365◦C to prevent clogging. The Li (Cs) Zeeman slower
laser is detuned 76 MHz (24 MHz) below the cooling transition. Under these conditions

Time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer

To sensitively detect small numbers of molecules in an atomic gas, pulsed two-photon
ionization is combined with time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry. The laser pulses are
delivered by a pulsed dye laser (Radiant Dyes Narrowscan with 7 ns pulse width and
13 mJ energy per pulse). Based on ab initio potentials [32] and previous spectroscopic
studies in a heat pipe [33] an ionization wavelength range near 680 nm was chosen
to achieve resonantly enhanced two-photon ionization of LiCs. The pulsed dye laser
beam is expanded to a 1.5 cm2 cross sectional area in order to have a large ionization
volume. The laser pulses produce a signiﬁcant atomic ion yield on the detector by
non-resonantly ionizing both Li and Cs atoms from the magneto-optical traps, either
with two photons from the 2p3/2 and 6p3/2 states, respectively, or with three photons
from the atomic ground states. To separate a small signal of LiCs+ from a large
signal of Cs+, a high mass resolution is required. For this purpose we implemented a

Wiley-McLaren time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer (see Fig. 1 and Refs. [34, 35]).

Upon formation, all ions are accelerated upwards by applying voltages to the ﬁeld
plates as indicated in Fig. 1. After passing a 30 cm drift region they are deﬂected onto
a microchannel plate detector (MCP) placed oﬀ the vertical axis in order to allow
optical access along this axis. By suitably adjusting the ratio between the voltages on
the lower (Ul) and the middle (Um) ﬁeld plate as well as the voltage on the deﬂection
electrode (Udef l), the ions are time-focused onto the detector, i.e., ions of the same
mass arrive at the MCP within a narrow time interval even though they are formed
at diﬀerent positions within the ionization volume. The resulting voltage pulse from
the MCP, due to Cs+ ions formed by ionization of atoms from the MOT, appears at
+ ion
a time τCs = 12.74 µs after the laser pulse and is about 50 ns wide. The Cs2
peak is slightly broader (70 ns), since the molecular ions are produced in a much larger
volume than the ions originating from trapped Cs atoms. The mass diﬀerence between
LiCs+ and Cs+ of 5% leads to a diﬀerence in time of ﬂight (scaling as √mass) of only
2.5%. We therefore expect the LiCs+ peak to appear at τLiCs = 13.07 µs, roughly
300 ns after the Cs+ peak, with a similar width as the Cs+

2 peak.

Since the Cs MOT contains many more atoms than LiCs molecules are expected
to be formed, it is necessary to suppress the Cs+ signal as much as possible. In order
to avoid two-photon ionization of Cs(6p3/2) atoms we block the laser beams of the
Cs MOT and of the Cs Zeeman slower in a 2 ms period before the dye laser pulse
arrives, using mechanical shutters. During this period all excited Cs atoms decay
to the electronic ground state and hence only three-photon ionization of Cs(6s1/2) is
possible. With this scheme we suppress the Cs+ signal by a factor of 50, resulting in
about one detected Cs+ ion per dye laser pulse.

Detection of LiCs molecules

In a ﬁrst set of measurements we record time-of-ﬂight traces with the dye laser
wavelength set to 682.78 nm. Fig. 2(a) shows an oscilloscope image recorded with
only the Cs MOT present, the laser beams of Li MOT and Li Zeeman slower being
blocked. In the upper part of the image the MCP voltage of about 1100 time-of-ﬂight
traces laid on top of each other is shown. The lower curve is an average over all traces.
Every time an ion hits the MCP detector a dip in the voltage is observed. On both
images we observe a large 50 ns wide peak centered at 12.74 µs originating from about
one Cs+ ion per dye laser pulse, produced by non-resonant three-photon ionization of
Cs MOT atoms.

Additionally, we ﬁnd a broad background of ions around the Cs+ peak in a time
interval from 300 ns before to 200 ns after the Cs+ arrival time. The detection rate
of such background ions is about one per ten dye pulses and therefore constitutes an
important source of background events near the expected LiCs+ peak. These ions
can be attributed to fast Cs+ ions formed by ionization of fast Cs atoms: Weakly
bound electronic ground state Cs2 molecules (formed by photoassociation induced by
Cs MOT light) are photodissociated by a ﬁrst dye laser photon. After dissociation the
two atoms are either in the Cs(6s1/2) and Cs(6p3/2) or in the Cs(6s1/2) and Cs(6p1/2)
states. Depending on the state they each have a kinetic energy of 0.18 eV or 0.22 eV,
respectively. The resulting Cs(6p) atom is then ionized by two-photon ionization.
Cs+ ions emerging from this process have a velocity of about 500 m/s and 550 m/s,
respectively, which leads to a broad distribution as observed in the measured time-of-
ﬂight trace. To avoid the fast Cs+ ion background at the expected arrival time of the

of each image shows about 1100 time-of-ﬂight traces on top of each other. The
lower curve represents an average of the traces. The Cs+ ions arrive at 12.74 µs,
the LiCs+ ions around 13.07 µs.

LiCs+ ions, we reduced its width to ∆τ = 500 ns by applying large absolute voltages
Ul and Um to the ﬁeld plates, which in turn decreases the ratio

∆τ
τLiCs − τCs .

In addition, the arrival time of the fast ions can be shifted to shorter arrival
times relative to the narrow Cs+ peak by adjusting the ratio of the ﬁeld plate
voltages (Ul/Um) at the cost of a slightly non-optimal time-focussing. By applying
these ﬁne-adjustments to the ﬁeld plates, we can clearly separate the fast Cs+ ion
background from ions at the expected LiCs+ arrival time. More speciﬁcally, at
Ul=800 V, Um=610 V and Udef l=1990 V the rate of Cs+ ions appearing within 100 ns
of the expected LiCs+ arrival time at 13.07 µs is about one ion per 4500 dye pulses.
In Fig. 2(b), recorded with both MOTs being present, we observe several ions in
excess of the Cs+ background, which impact on the detector at the expected LiCs+
arrival time, in addition to the Cs+ peak and a broad background as in Fig. 2(a). These
ions are only observed when both the Li and the Cs MOTs are present. In a window
of 100 ns width around the expected LiCs+ arrival time four ion signals are counted
in 1100 dye pulses. To exclude that these ions are produced by processes induced by
the Li trapping light at 670 nm, such as photodissociation of Cs2, we compared the
measurements in Fig. 2(a), where all Li lasers are blocked, to measurements with the
Li MOT laser beams present but the Li Zeeman slower laser beam being blocked, i.e.
with no Li atoms being loaded into the MOT. In both cases only about one ion every
4500 cycles appears within a 100 ns window at the expected LiCs+ arrival time. Thus,
we conclude that the ions observed in Fig. 2(b) at a much larger rate originate from
cold LiCs molecules formed out of cold Li and Cs atoms in the two-species MOT.

Photoassociation of LiCs molecules induced by the laser light can only occur via
the Li(2s1/2)+Cs(6p3/2) asymptote. Photoassociation to potentials correlating to the
Li(2p3/2)+Cs(6s1/2) asymptote is excluded since all potentials are repulsive beyond
50 ˚A, with the exception of one potential curve which is slightly attractive and supports
a potential minimum around 70 ˚A. However, this potential well is extremely shallow
so that photoassociation into this well is not possible since the Li laser detunings are
much larger than the well depth [36]. Since the Cs MOT and Zeeman slower laser
light is blocked in a 2 ms period before the ionization pulse, all molecules formed via

Formation of ultracold LiCs molecules

6

the Li(2s1/2)+Cs(6p3/2) asymptote must have decayed to the electronic ground state
before ionization. In the case of LiCs formation by three-body recombination, which is
unlikely due to the comparatively small pair densities, the molecules would be formed
directly in the electronic ground state. In either case, the detected LiCs+ ions arise
from ultracold LiCs molecules in the electronic ground state.

The 2 ms time interval between the blocking of the Cs MOT lasers and the
ionization pulse gives an upper bound on the velocity of the molecules. Only molecules
can be ionized which have not left the ionization region resulting in a maximal velocity
of 5 m/s. However, the corresponding temperature of 0.3 K can only be seen as an
upper bound. Based on other experiments with KRb and NaCs [22, 23] we expect a
temperature for LiCs on the order of 100 µK given by the Cs temperature.

Within the measured 1100 dye laser pulses, we detect (3.6

10−3 LiCs
ground state molecules per ionization pulse after background subtraction and assuming
Poissonian statistical uncertainties.
In order to estimate the LiCs production rate
several factors must be taken into account. Due to gravity and ﬁnite kinetic energy
the molecules leave the ionization volume. Therefore, they can be ionized only in
an interval of 13 ms after their production. Due to the 10 Hz repetition rate of
the ion detection, only 13% of the produced molecules are available for ionization.
Additionally, our detector is estimated to have a detection eﬃciency of about 20%
[34]. Assuming that all molecules within the laser ﬁeld of the dye pulse are ionized, we
derive a production rate of 0.14
0.08 molecular ions per second. As the ionization
process has not yet been investigated, the ionization probability is estimated to lie
between 10% and 0.1%, depending on the proximity of the dye laser wavelength to
an intermediate resonance state. This leads us to an estimate of the actual molecule
production rate between 1.4

80 LiCs molecules per second.

molecular production rate can be approximately written as

where NCs is the total number of Cs atoms, nLi the Li peak density and βLiCs the

rate coeﬃcient between 10−18 cm3s−1 and 10−16 cm3s−1 for 10% and 0.1% ionization
probability, respectively. A similar range of production rate coeﬃcients results from a
second set of measurements, which we performed with a smaller Li MOT at a dye laser
wavelength of 681.08 nm. The obtained range of rate coeﬃcients is in agreement with
the calculated Franck-Condon factors for polar alkali dimer photoassociation [28]. This
calculation predicts for LiCs a rate coeﬃcient of about an order of magnitude smaller
as compared to the formation rate of NaCs measured as 10−15 cm3s−1 in a MOT [23].
Both the LiCs and the NaCs formation rates are much smaller than the observed rate

Conclusion

We report on the ﬁrst detection of ultracold LiCs molecules in the electronic ground
state. The molecule formation rate coeﬃcient is estimated to be between 10−18 cm3s−1
and 10−16 cm3s−1. This coeﬃcient is smaller than the values obtained for NaCs and
KRb [22, 23], which can be essentially explained by the small reduced mass of LiCs

and the very large C6 coeﬃcients for KRb [28, 36]. Future experiments on LiCs
will therefore include photoassociation with a tunable cw Ti:Sapphire laser either
in the two-species MOT or an optical dipole trap [37], which should lead to LiCs
production rates larger by orders of magnitude [38]. Furthermore, ionization spectra
as a function of the dye laser wavelength will be measured to analyze the vibrational
state distribution of the formed molecules. By transferring the formed molecules to
low lying vibrational states of the X1Σ+ state by stimulated Raman processes [39] or
using microwave ﬁelds, cold polar molecules with electric dipole moment as large as
5.5 Debye [17] can be obtained for studies on dipolar gases and ultracold chemistry.

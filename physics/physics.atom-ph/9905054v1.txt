Abstract

For the lithium dimer we calculate cross sections for absorption of radi-
ation from the vibrational-rotational levels of the ground X 1Σ+
state to the vibrational levels and continua of the excited A 1Σ+

g electronic
u and B 1Πu
electronic states. Theoretical and experimental data are used to character-

ize the molecular properties taking advantage of knowledge recently obtained

from photoassociation spectroscopy and ultra-cold atom collision studies. The

quantum-mechanical calculations are carried out for temperatures in the range

from 1000 to 2000 K and are compared with previous calculations and mea-

surements.

I. INTRODUCTION

The absorption spectra of pure alkali-metal vapors at temperatures of the order 1000 K

can be a rich source of information on molecular potentials and properties. Achieving a high

vapor pressure of lithium in experiments requires higher temperatures than the other alkali-

metal atoms, but there are some data from heat pipe ovens [1–3] and from a specialized

apparatus [4]. In addition to the atomic lines the spectra exhibit gross molecular features

attributable to transitions between bound levels of the ground electronic state and levels of

the excited singlet states and weaker features arising from analogous triplet transitions.

Theoretically, the envelope of the alkali-metal molecular absorption spectra can be quan-

titatively reproduced using semi-classical models [5–9] and ro-vibrational structure [7] and

continua [10] can be reproduced from quantum-mechanical models. In this paper we cal-
g –B 1Πu
culate quantum-mechanically absorption spectra for the X 1Σ+
transitions in Li2. Although both semi-classical [7] and quantum-mechanical [7,11] calcula-

u and X 1Σ+

g –A 1Σ+

tions have been performed and compared [7] previously for these transitions of Li2, recent

improvements in the molecular data prompt the present comprehensive study.

From photoassociation spectroscopy and cold collision studies performed in the last few

years as well as recent theoretical work there have been signiﬁcant critical tests of and

improvements to the molecular potentials [12–14], particularly at long-range [15–17], and

transition dipole moment data [15] available for Li2, as well as to the value of the lifetime

of the Li 2p state [18,19]. This paper presents calculations of the spectra over the full range

II. QUANTUM THEORY OF ABSORPTION CROSS SECTION

In the quantum-mechanical formulation an absorption cross section from a vibration-
rotation state of the lower electronic state (v′′, J ′′, Λ′′) to the vibration-rotation state of the
upper electronic state (v′, J ′, Λ′) is

σv′J ′Λ′
v′′J ′′Λ′′(ν) =

|hφv′′J ′′Λ′′| D(R) |φv′J ′Λ′i|

g(ν − νij)

where g(ν − νij) is a line-shape function of dimension ν−1, SJ ′Λ′
J ′′Λ′′ is the H¨onl-London factor
and νij ≡ |Ev′J ′Λ′ − Ev′′J ′′Λ′′| is the transition frequency [20,21]. In this study, g(ν − νij) is
approximated by 1/∆ν, with ∆ν the bin size. For a bound-free transition, the absorption
cross section from a bound level of the lower electronic state (v′′J ′′Λ′′) to a continuum level
of the upper electronic state (ǫ′J ′Λ′) can be written as

σǫ′J ′Λ′
v′′J ′′Λ′′(ν) =

where the continuum wave function φǫ′J ′Λ′ is energy normalized. Free-bound or free-free
transitions are not considered since the temperatures studied here are not high enough for

these types of transitions to be important within the singlet manifold.

The radial wave function can be obtained from the Schr¨odinger equation for the relative

where V (R) is the rotationless potential energy for the electronic state, µ = 6 394.7 is the
reduced mass of the 7Li atoms, and E is for bound states the eigenvalue EvJΛ measured
with respect to the dissociation limit associated with the wave function φ(R) = φvJΛ(R).
Similarly, for continuum states E is the relative kinetic energy of the colliding atoms EǫJΛ
associated with the energy-normalized wave function φ(R) = φǫJΛ(R).

The total absorption cross section at frequency ν can be obtained by averaging over
initial vibration-rotation levels (v′′, J ′′, Λ′′) with a relevant weighting factor and summing
over all possible bound-bound and bound-free transitions with frequencies between ν and

III. MOLECULAR DATA

The adopted molecular potentials of the X 1Σ+

u and B 1Πu states are shown in
Fig. 1. The ground X1Σ+
g state potential was constructed using the approach of Ref. [22].
We adopted the recommended [23] potential obtained by Barakat et al. [24], who applied

g , A 1Σ+

the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) method to measured energies. The data were connected

smoothly to the long-range form

V (R) = −

C6
R6 −

C8
R8 −

C10
R10 + Vexc(R),

where Vexc(R) is the exchange energy [22] and the coeﬃcients C6, C8, and C10 have been

calculated in Refs. [15,25–27] and we use atomic units in this section. We adopted the
coeﬃcients C6 = 1 393.39, C8 = 83 425.8 and C10 = 7.372 × 106 from Ref. [26]. The
two regions were connected at R = 23.885 a0 yielding a value of 8516.95 cm−1 for the
g state of 7Li2, in satisfactory agreement with the accepted
dissociation energy of the X1Σ+
value of 8516.61 cm−1 [23]. The form a exp(−bR) was used to extrapolate the potential
at short-range where the constants were determined to smoothly connect to the innermost
RKR points. The resulting X 1Σ+
g potential yields an s-wave scattering length of 33.6 a0,
in excellent agreement with the accepted [28] value of 33 ± 2 and a sensitive test of the

assembled data.

For the excited A1Σ+

u state the RKR potential of Ref. [17] was adopted and smoothly

connected at about R = 140 a0 to the long-range form

with coeﬃcients C3 = −11.000 226 and C6 = 2 075.05 from Ref. [26] and C8 = 2.705 ×
105 from Ref. [15]. For R < 3.78 a0 the data were connected to the short range form
u state is determined to be 9 352.194 cm−1
a exp(−bR). The dissociation energy for the A1Σ+
in our calculation, in good agreement with the experimental value [29] of 9 352.5(6) cm−1
given in Ref. [30].

The potential for the B1Πu state has a hump with maximum at R ≈ 11 a0 and various
determinations of the hump location and height have been summarized in Refs. [31] and [30].

We adopted the IPA (Inverted Perturbation Approach) potentials from Hessel and Vidal [32]

for R < 9.35 a0 and the ab initio potential of Schmidt-Mink et al. [30] for 10.5 < R < 30 a0
with one additional point at R = 11.2 a0 ﬁxing the barrier maximum energy at 512 cm−1
above dissociation. At R = 30 a0 the data were connected to the long-range form of Eq. (7)
by shifting down the data by 0.3 cm−1 from 10.5 < R < 30. The values of the coeﬃcients

4

used in Eq. (7) were C3 = 5.500 113 and C6 = 1406.08 from Ref. [26] and C8 = 4.756 × 104
from Ref. [15]. The potential energy data for R < 9.35 a0 were ﬁxed using the B 1Πu state
dissociation energy of 2 984.8 cm−1, which we determined using the experimental value for
Te of 20 436.32 cm−1 [32], the atomic asymptotic energy of 14 904.0 cm−1, and the X 1Σ+
g
dissociation energy of 8 516.61 cm−1 [23]. Finally, the data in the range 9.35 < R < 10.5 were
smoothly connected using cubic splines. For R < 4.254 61 a0 the data were extrapolated

using the short range form a exp(−bR).

Transition dipole moments for the X 1Σ+

g –B 1Πu transitions are avail-
able from ab initio calculations [33,34,30] and for X–A transitions from measured lifetimes of
A state levels [35]. For the electronic transition dipole moments D(R), we adopted ab initio

u and X 1Σ+

g –A 1Σ+

calculations of Ratcliﬀ, Fish, and Konowalow [33] connected at R = 35 a0 to the long-range

asymptotic form

D∞(R) = D0 +

b
R3 .

(8)

The value of the coeﬃcient D0 was 3.3175 for both X–A and X–B transitions and the

coeﬃcient b was 283.07 or −141.53 [15] for, respectively, X–A or X–B transitions. For both

transitions, we multiplied D∞(R) calculated using the above coeﬃcients by a constant such
that the value D∞(35) was identical to the corresponding ab initio value from Ref. [33]

to provide a smooth connection between short and long-range forms for D(R). The X–A
dipole moment function that we adopted is consistent with that derived by Baumgartner et

al. [35] from experimental measurements. There is no experimentally-derived dipole moment

function for the X–B transition.

IV. RESULTS

Bound and continuum wave functions were calculated using the Numerov method to

integrate Eq. (3). For the X and A states, eigenvalues were generally in good agreement

with the Rydberg-Klein-Rees values used as input to the potentials constructed.
[There
is an apparent misprint for the energy of the v′′ = 9 level of the X1Σ+
g state in Ref. [24].
We used 3 098.641 2 cm−1, consistent with Ref. [29].] The constructed B 1Πu state potential
can reproduce the rotationless IPA energies tabulated by Hessel and Vidal typically to
about 0.1 cm−1, with the greatest discrepancy 0.15 cm−1 for the v′ = 13 value. Calculated
frequencies of B 1Πu–X 1Σ+
g transitions were also compared with calculations of Verma, Koch,
and Stwalley [36] and the agreement was good, within 0.1 cm−1. Four quasi-bound levels of

the B 1Πu state were found. For the rotationless potential their calculated eigenvalues are
143.91, 276.7, 391.74 and 483.88 cm−1 above the dissociation limit for v′ = 14 to v′ = 17.

The calculated term energies of vibration-rotation states in the X 1Σ+

g state were used
to compute partition functions using Eq. (5). The maximum vibrational and rotational
quantum numbers in our calculations are 41 and 123, respectively, for the X 1Σ+
g state.
In the harmonic approximation for ro-vibrational energies, the partition function can be

calculated using the simple expression

˜Zl ≡ ZRZv ≈

ωJ ′′(2J ′′ + 1) exp[−hcBeJ ′′(J ′′ + 1)/kT ]

exp[−hνe(v′′ + 1/2)/kT ],

(9)

which assumes that the term energy can be described by the ﬁrst terms of the power se-

ries with respect to vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. Using constants νe/c =
351.3904 cm−1 and Be = 0.672 566 cm−1 [32] the partition function from Eq. (9) was calcu-
lated and it is compared with the partition function calculated from Eq. (5) for the X 1Σ+
g
state as a function of temperature in Fig. 2. The anharmonicity of the potential for higher

vibrational levels accounts for the diﬀerences between the two results with increasing tem-
perature. For J > 2 the X 1Σ+
g state supports quasibound vibrational levels. The expression
Eq. (5) for Zl does not specify whether quasibound states are to be included or not in the
summations. We evaluated Zl with and without the quasibound levels to ascertain their
importance and the results are shown in Fig. 2. The eﬀect of the additional levels becomes

increasingly signiﬁcant with higher temperature. For the present study covering tempera-
tures between 1000 and 2000 K there is not a signiﬁcant distinction between Zl, ˜Zl, and the
result with the inclusion of the quasibound states.

The molecular fraction can be calculated using the expression

[NLi2]/[NLi]2 = (QLi2/Q2

Li) exp(De/kT ),

(10)

where the atomic partition function QLi is 2(2πmLikT /h2)3/2, with the electronic partition
function for the atom well-approximated by the spin degeneracy of 2 for the temperatures
studied in the present work, and the molecular partition function QLi2 is (2πmLi2kT /h2)3/2Zl,
with the electronic partition function for the X 1Σ+
g state taking the value 1. The molecular
fraction Eq. (10) is plotted in Fig. 2. The absorption coeﬃcient k(ν) can be obtained if the

atomic density is known from

k(ν) = [NLi2]σ(ν).

A. Lifetimes

Lifetimes of the various ro-vibrational levels of the A 1Σ+

u state were measured [35] and
calculated, see for example, Refs. [37,38,22]. We calculated spontaneous emission transition
probabilities and lifetimes of rotational-vibrational levels of the A1Σ+
u state in order to test
the adopted transition dipole moment. The spontaneous emission rate from a bound state
(v′J ′Λ′) to a bound state (v′′J ′Λ′′) is

A(v′J ′Λ′; v′′J ′Λ′′) =

64π4ν3
3hc3 g |hφv′′J ′Λ′′| D(R) |φv′J ′Λ′i|

,

where the electronic state degeneracy is

(12)

(13)

g =

(2 − δ0,Λ′+Λ′′)
2 − δ0,Λ′

and we have neglected change in the rotational quantum number. The total spontaneous
emission rate from the upper level (v′J ′Λ′) can be obtained by summing over all possible
transitions to bound and continuum states

A(v′J ′Λ′) =

A(v′J ′Λ′; v′′J ′Λ′′) +

dǫ′′A(v′J ′Λ′; ǫ′′J ′Λ′′),

(14)

Xv′′Λ′′

Λ′′ Z

where A(v′J ′Λ′; ǫ′′J ′Λ′′) is the spontaneous emission probability to a continuum energy ǫ′′
with partial wave J ′. The lifetime is

τ = 1/A(v′J ′Λ′).

(15)

Lifetimes of levels v′J ′ of the A 1Σ+
u state is aﬀected by indirect predissociation via the a 3Σ+

u state were measured by Baumgartner et al. [35]. The
A 1Σ+
u states [39,40].
The measured lifetimes τm of vibration-rotation levels thought to be unaﬀected by indirect
predissociation taken from Ref. [35] and corresponding calculated lifetimes τc are presented
in Fig. 3 along with calculated term energies expressed relative to the potential minimum of

u and 1 3Π+

the A state. The energies are plotted in the order of the values listed in Table 1 of Ref. [35]
and correspond to a range of values of (v′, J ′) from (0,15) to (24,25). The agreement between
τc and τm is good within the experimental precision of ±2 percent [35]. The quasi-bound
levels and continua of the X 1Σ+
g state inside or above the high centrifugal potential barriers
are found to be important in calculating lifetimes of high J levels. For instance, by including

transitions to three quasi-bound levels and the continuum states the calculated lifetime of the
u (v′ = 20, J ′ = 50) level changes from 22.7 ns to 19.3 ns which is close to the measured
A 1Σ+
lifetime of 18.66 ±0.37 ns [35]. The calculated and measured lifetimes agree well up to about

7

4 500 cm−1 in agreement with the ﬁndings of Ref. [30]. From approximately 5 000 cm−1 and
higher the experimental lifetimes slightly decrease relative to theory by about 0.8 ns or ﬁve
percent, as demonstrated in Fig. 3. We investigated whether the 21Σ+
g state might supply
an additional spontaneous decay channel, but the theoretical value Te = 20 128 cm−1 [30] for
this state appears to place its minimum at around 6 000 cm−1 relative to the minimum of the
A 1Σ+
u state, apparently ruling this mechanism out. The reason for the signiﬁcant downturn
of experimental lifetimes for higher term energies is currently not understood; however, the

overall excellent agreement between our calculated lifetimes and the measurements gives

us conﬁdence in our molecular data and calculational procedures. We compare selected
examples from the present results with calculations by Watson [37] and by Sangfelt et al. [38]

in Table I. The calculations of Sangfelt et al. are larger than ours, probably because

theoretical transition energies were used. A simple rescaling using experimental energies, as

pointed out by those authors, yields lifetimes in good agreement with the present work. The

dipole moment function calculated by Watson [37] is in good agreement with that adopted

in the present study and cannot account for the shorter lifetimes obtained in that study. We
present a more extensive tabulation of A 1Σ+
u lifetimes in Table II covering the same values
tabulated in Table VII of Ref. [38].

Lifetimes for levels of the B 1Πu state have been calculated by Uzer, Watson, and Dal-
garno [41], Uzer and Dalgarno [39], and Sangfelt et al. [38] and there appear to be no
experimental data. In Table III we compare our calculated lifetimes of selected B 1Πu lev-
els with available calculations for higher values of J ′. The present results lie between the
calculations of Uzer et al. [41] and those of Sangfelt et al. [38]. The lifetimes calculated by

Uzer et al. are longer than ours because their transition dipole moment function, calculated
using a model potential method, is smaller than the ab initio dipole moment of Ratcliﬀ

et al. [33] adopted in the present study. The dipole moment function calculated by Sangfelt
et al., on the other hand, is in good agreement with that adopted in the present work. As

those authors pointed out, and as our results illustrate, the utilization in their calculation of

calculated excitation energies which were larger than experimental energies yielded lifetimes
that were too short. In Table IV we present a more extensive tabulation of B 1Πu lifetimes
covering the same values tabulated in Table VIII of Ref. [38].

B. Absorption cross sections

Absorption spectra arising from molecular singlet transitions at the far wings of the
g -B 1Πu transitions and a

atomic 2p line at 671 nm consist of a blue wing due to X 1Σ+

8

g -A 1Σ+

red wing due to X 1Σ+
u transitions. Calculations for bound–bound (bb) and bound–
free (bf) absorption cross sections were carried out separately using Eq. (4) with ∆ν =
8 cm−1. The results for the total (the sum of bb and bf) absorption cross sections at
temperatures of 1000 K, 1500 K and 2033 K are given in Figs. 4–6. The ratios of the
peak cross sections of the X 1Σ+
u wing are higher
at lower temperatures. As temperature increases, absorption spectra spread out from the

g –B 1Πu wing to those of the X 1Σ+

g –A 1Σ+

peak spectral regions and there emerges near 900 nm a satellite feature arising from the
minimum [42] in the X 1Σ+
u diﬀerence potential and the maximum of the transition
dipole moment function [43,33]. We also show the bf contributions to the cross sections

g -A 1Σ+

on each plot. The bf component contributes mainly to the extreme blue part of the blue

wing and increases in magnitude signiﬁcantly as the temperature increases. It is found that
transitions to quasibound and continuum levels of the B 1Πu state contribute signiﬁcantly
to the total absorption spectra in the case of X 1Σ+
g -B 1Πu transitions, apparently because
there is less vibrational oscillator strength density in the discrete part of the spectrum for
the B state compared to the A state. Transitions into quasibound states of the A 1Σ+
u or
B 1Πu states have been included in the results for the total cross sections in Figs. 4–6.

Theoretical quantum-mechanical calculations for absorption cross sections from the
X 1Σ+
g state to the A 1Σ+
u state over the spectral range 600–950 nm were carried out by
Lam et al. [7] using a constant dipole moment of 6.58 D at 1020 K, for which bf transitions

are not signiﬁcant. Our calculations in Fig. 4 are about a factor of 10 less than the result

shown in Fig. 5 of Ref. [7], but agree well both in overall shape and in details of ﬁner struc-

tures. We repeated the calculations using the constant dipole moment of Ref. [7] for both

classical and quantum-mechanical cross sections and although these two results agreed with

each other, they were also a factor of 10 less than the result shown in Fig. 5 of Ref. [7].

Thus it appears to us that there may be a mislabeling of the vertical axis in Fig. 5 of Lam et
al. [A similar calculation that we performed [44] for Na2 at 800 K is in complete agreement

with Fig. 4 of Ref. [7].]

Calculations of absorption spectra at 2033 K over the spectral range 450–750 nm pre-

sented in Fig. 6 are in good agreement with the measured values of Erdman et al. [4] and

with quantum-mechanical calculations performed by Mills [11]. The experimental study of

Erdman et al. [4] involved an investigation of molecular triplet states [4] and did not explore

the satellite feature at 900 nm. The calculations over the range 450–750 nm by Mills [11]

included triplet molecular transitions and are not directly comparable with the present re-

sults. Nevertheless since the singlet transitions dominate the absorption we ﬁnd excellent

qualitative agreement with the calculations presented by Mills.

FIG. 2. Comparison at various temperatures of the partition functions ˜Zl, calculated using
Eq. (9) and experimentally determined spectroscopic constants, curve A, and Zl, from Eq. (5)

and numerically determined eigenvalues, curves B and C. Inclusion of quasibound states in the

calculation of Zl results in curve C as discussed in the text. Curve D represents the molecular
fraction [NLi2]/[NLi]2, Eq. (10), as a function of temperature.

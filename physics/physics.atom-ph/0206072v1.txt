A chaotic ’turnstile’ for atoms in periodic potentials

Using a new type of chaotic ratchet generated by pulsed standing waves of light, we propose a
mechanism which would allow packets of atoms travelling through a pulsed optical lattice in one
direction to pass almost undisturbed, while strongly heating atoms drifting through in the opposite
direction. An analytical formula for the diﬀusive energy growth is derived and shown to give good
agreement with numerical calculations.

There is much ongoing interest in ratchets- in other
words the use of periodic (but spatially and/or tempo-
rally asymmetric) systems which can be used to generate
a current when there is no net force: see [1] for a com-
prehensive review. Much of the work has focussed on
Brownian ratchets [2] which play an important role in
biophysical systems such as molecular motors. Corre-
sponding quantum ratchets have also been investigated
[3].

There has been comparatively little work on Hamilto-
nian ratchets, which are ’clean’ ratchets without extrin-
sic noise or dissipation. Mixed phase-space mechanisms
(involving tori/stable islands) for ratchet transport have
been investigated [4, 5, 6].
In [4] general properties of
ratchets and a mechanism involving desymmetrization of
ballistic ﬂights was proposed. In [5] a sum rule connect-
ing the current in regular islands with that in adjoining
chaotic manifolds was derived.

Until recently it was not thought that a fully chaotic
system could admit a ratchet eﬀect. But in [7] a fully
chaotic ratchet mechanism was proposed for atoms in
a double-well periodic lattice, pulsed with unequal peri-
ods. The ratchet depends on the generic properties of
the chaotic diﬀusion so the initial state requires no spe-
ciﬁc preparation: in all cases it was found that in general
there is a classical timescale tr, during which particles
moving with negative momenta (relative to the initial
value) absorb energy at a diﬀerent rate from those mov-
ing in the opposite direction. In the corresponding quan-
tum ratchet, for a signiﬁcant eﬀect to develop, it was
found in [7] that it is simply necessary that the quantum
break-time t∗ be of similar magnitude to tr.

Atoms in pulsed optical

lattices have become a
paradigm in the study of quantum chaos; experiments
on sodium and cesium atoms [8] have provided a convinc-
ing demonstration of dynamical localization (DL) [9, 10],
the quantum suppression of chaotic diﬀusion. The dy-
namics for the usual experiment is given by the kicked-
particle Hamiltonian : H = p
nT )
where K is the kick strength. The classical dynamics is
obtained by iterating the well-known ’Standard Map’ :
xi+1 = xi + piT ; pi+1 = pi + K sin x.

The rocking ratchet [6] was been analysed in the regime
where regular tori are still present ; it was found that
although it no longer has the 2π periodicity in p of the
standard map, there is a long range periodicity in p which
is of order 2π/b. Also, since pairs of corresponding tori
are located asymmetrically about p = 0, the resulting
conﬁnement of classical trajectories can yield transport.
Here we investigate this system in the chaotic regime.
One aim of this work is to demonstrate that the physics
is similar to that found in [7] and hence that the new
chaotic ratchet mechanism is quite generic: both ratchets
1
depend on the ratchet timescale tr ∼
b2D in the classical
case, where D is the diﬀusion rate, and the break-time
t∗
D/~2 in the quantum case. The ratchet currents
were found in [7] to originate predominantly from corre-
lations of the form < V ′(xi)V ′(xi+2) > . We show below
that the resulting analytical formulae accurately predict
phenomena such as current reversals, without any de-
tailed consideration of the structure of phase-space.

∼

Further, while [7] considered only the ratchet current
which arises for a system with initially zero current, ie
< p(t = 0) >= 0, here we present results for the case
where there is an initial drift < p(t = 0) >= p0. We
show that this can form the basis of a device to manip-
ulate traﬃc of cold atoms moving along some channel
in a trap. This is not so far-fetched, since the trapping
of atoms in devices such as atom chips is now a real-
ity. The proposed device represents a sort of ’turnstile’
which would selectively heat only atoms moving in one
direction, while imparting little or no energy to atoms
moving in the opposite direction, since we can tune the
parameters of the pulsed lattice so as to generate corre-
lations which almost cancel the energy diﬀusion in one
direction, but enhance it in the other. Since the rock-
ing ratchet produces much simpler analytical expressions
than the double well ratchet, it provides a better didactic

example of the underlying physics.

For the Standard Map , at the lowest level of approx-
imation, the momenta at consecutive kicks are uncorre-
lated and evolve in time as a ’random-walk’. The average
momentum of a large ensemble of particles is unchanged.
The average energy grows linearly:
if the momenta are
uncorrelated the average kinetic energy grows by K 2/4
at each consecutive kick. In the absence of phase-space
barriers the energy is unbounded and this diﬀusive in-
crease in energy continues indeﬁnitely. It is characterized
by a diﬀusion rate D0, ie < p2 >= D0t so for uncorre-
lated momenta D0 = K 2/2. However, this results ne-
glects correlations between consecutive sequences of kick;
if included, they result in well-known corrections to the
diﬀusion constant in the form of Bessel functions and
D0 = K
2J2(K)...) [11, 14]. These cor-
rections have even been measured experimentally with
cold cesium atoms in pulsed optical lattices [13].

It is easy to show, by direct substitution from the map
that one obtains separate integrals over the x and p . For
chaotic diﬀusion it is usual to neglect odd integrals, for
0, while even integrals yield a
example < sin p cos p >
positive average, eg < sin2 p >=< cos2 p >= 1/2, since
after a few kicks the ensemble has a substantial spread
in p. In eﬀect the only terms which contribute to C(2) in
the standard map are even in p and do not diﬀerentiate
p. The integral over x yields J2(K), hence the
between
form of C(2).

We consider now the map of [6], with a rocking linear
potential, which consists of a repeating cycle of two kicks.

Following the usual procedure, we now obtain a modiﬁed
form for the 2-kick average, but ﬁnd that the momentum
averages now include terms of the form < sin2 p. sin 2pb >
and < cos2 p. sin 2pb >. At small t, pb is small while
sin2 p oscillates rapidly, hence we can approximate these
by 1/2 < sin 2pb >
1/2 >
where pav is the average momentum relative to the intial
momentum. We note that such terms are the origin of
the ratchet eﬀect proposed in [7]. These terms are odd
in p and hence- unlike the standard map case- depend on
whether we average our momenta from 0
or from
0
. As in [7] below we consider the case of par-
ticles with positive momenta separately from those with

diﬀerential energy diﬀusion rates for particles moving in
opposite directions.

We consider ﬁrst the case where p(t = 0) = 0 (or
we take a cloud of particles with a narrow gaussian
distribution peaked about p = 0), but later consider
the case where the initial current is non-zero. We take

no transport, while for A = (2n+1)π/2, there is maximal

is much more complicated than Eq.0.4. For an ensem-

In Eq.0.6 we have also made the small angle approx-
imation; but when pb is large, the cos 2pb and sin 2pb
terms average to zero, hence C(2, p0)

cally for t > tr regardless of the value of p0. After this,
the average energy growth for the particles with posi-
tive and negative momenta (relative to p0) is equal to
D0t. Regardless of p0, the timescale for these correla-
tions to be ’averaged-out’ is given by the ratchet time of
(D0b2)−1, the time required for the distribution

to broaden to a substantial width in pb.
In [6] it was
found that although the classical map does not have the
2π periodicity of the standard map, it has a new long-
ranged periodicity in p, with periodicity
2π/b. From
the formula, we see that the periodicity of the correction
is half of this: C(2, p0 = 0) = C(2, p0 = π/b). We note
that since the C(2) correction vanishes when the distri-
bution size becomes of order one cell in p, the long range
periodicity in this respect is not signiﬁcant to the magni-
tude of current accumulated: by the time the expanding
distribution samples the periodicity boundary, < p > is
almost constant: we have tested this numerically.

We now consider how one might exploit Eq.0.6 to con-
struct a cold atom ’turnstile’. For simplicity we take the
case A = π/2. Consider the case of a packet of cold
atoms drifting through the lattice with a constant drift,

FIG. 3: Shows the eﬀect of a pulsed lattice on a system with
ﬁnite initial current. Figure 3a demonstrates the ’turnstile’
eﬀect on particles moving through the lattice with initial mo-
menta p0 = ±27 ≃ π/(4b). The initial momentum distribu-
tions are shown, as well as the eﬀect of ≃ 125 kicks on the
ﬁnal distributions. We see that while particles moving right
have absorbed relatively little energy, the particles moving left
have substantially increased average kinetic energy. In Fig 3b
we show that Eq.0.6 accurately describes the energy absorp-
tion at short times. The upper ﬁgure shows energy growth for
cos A = π and p0b = ±π/4. Energy absorption is asymmetric
about p0 and is greater than D0t if p0, pav are of diﬀerent sign,
but smaller otherwise. The lower ﬁgure corresponds closely
to Fig3a. Energy absorption rates are symmetric about p0
but are ≃ 15 times faster for negative momenta relative to
positive momenta.

only slightly perturbed, the cloud moving left has been
heated to much larger average kinetic energies. Since for
this case C(2, p0, p±
av) now has no dependence on pav for
short times, the particles absorb energy symmetrically
about p0 =

π/(4b).

The corresponding quantum case was investigated in
[7]; for the equivalent quantum turnstile to show similar
behaviour we require only that the quantum break-time
t∗ should be of the same order or longer than the duration
of the classical turnstile (ie
100 kicks for the above
example, though we can adjust this by varying b). For t <
t∗, the quantum behaviour follows closely the classical
behaviour. For t > t∗, the quantum wavepacket localizes
and absorbs no more energy, thus ’freezing-in’ the ratchet
asymmetry. For the turnstile, if the lattice region is of
ﬁnite extent, the limiting time could be the time the atom
spends within the optical lattice if this is less than t∗.

In Fig.3b we further verify Eq.0.6 by plotting the ac-
tual energy growth for the case A = π (upper graph) and
A = π/2 (lower graph). For the upper graph, only the
cos A terms contribute; since we take p0 =
π/4, we can
see from both the formula (C(2)
2bpav sin p0b) and
the numerics that for p0, pav of the same sign, trajecto-
ries absorb energy slower that D0t while for p0, pav of
diﬀerent sign the converse is true. The lower ﬁgure cor-
responds closely to the ’turnstile’ shown in Fig.3a since
we have sin A = π/2. The ﬁgure shows that for short
times, the energy of particles initially with p0 =
π/4
grows linearly. However the negative momentum parti-
cles absorb energy
15 times faster than the particles
≃
with a positive drift.

In conclusion, we have shown the chaotic ratchet eﬀect
found in [7] is generic in character and applies to another
class of ratchets. We show that by means of a simple an-
alytical formula the eﬀect can be maximised and use this
to propose a mechanism for manipulating cold atoms. In
particular we show that we can have a pulsed optical lat-
tice that after 100
200 kicks has imparted considerable
energy to particles moving in one direction, while parti-
cles moving in the opposite direction absorb little energy.
Since the mechanism is based on fully chaotic dynamics
rather than a regime with stable islands, no position is
special so no preparation of the initial state is required.

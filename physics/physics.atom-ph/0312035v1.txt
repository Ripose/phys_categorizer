We investigate the electromagnetic transition probabilities for the helium atom embedded in a
superstrong magnetic ﬁeld taking into account the ﬁnite nuclear mass. We address the regime
γ = 100 − 10 000 a.u. studying several excited states for each symmetry, i.e.
for the magnetic
quantum numbers 0, −1, −2, −3, positive and negative z parity and singlet and triplet symmetry.
The oscillator strengths as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld, and in particular the inﬂuence of the
ﬁnite nuclear mass on the oscillator strengths are shown and analyzed.

INTRODUCTION

Exposing matter to strong and superstrong magnetic ﬁelds (which are ﬁelds of the order of 105 T and above) dra-
matically changes its properties and yields new and unexpected phenomena. On the microscopic scale, i.e. for atomic
and molecular systems, magnetic forces have a tremendous inﬂuence on the electronic structure and quantum dynam-
ics [1, 2, 3]. This is due to the diﬀerent appearances of the Coulomb and magnetic forces. From a theoretical point
of view, strong and superstrong magnetic ﬁelds are interesting, because the competing forces prevent a perturbative
treatment of the problem. Therefore it is necessary to develop and apply new nonperturbative techniques.

Certain astrophysical objects possess strong and superstrong magnetic ﬁelds [4, 5, 6]. Atmospheres of magnetic
white dwarfs are exposed to ﬁelds of the order of 100 – 105 T, magnetic ﬁelds in the photosphere of neutron stars
are of the order of 105 –1010 T. For the interpretation of the spectra of these astrophysical objects a wealth of highly
accurate atomic and molecular energies, transition wavelengths and transition probabilities are needed. An example
for the analysis of astrophysical spectra of magnetized objects using atomic data in strong ﬁelds is the white dwarf
GrW+70◦8247, which represents a cornerstone for the understanding of magnetic white dwarfs in general [7, 8, 9, 10].
Highly accurate data are available for hydrogen in strong magnetic ﬁelds since more than a decade [1, 2, 11]. This
system is now understood to a very high degree. However beyond hydrogen, there is signiﬁcant interest in detailed
data on heavier elements, such as He, Na, Fe and even molecules. Especially helium plays an important role in the
atmospheres of magnetic white dwarfs and potentially also neutron stars. The electronic structure of the helium atom
has been considered by several authors during the last decades [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. However most of
the corresponding investigations are restricted to a few states or ﬁeld strengths. Only a few works provide accuracies,
that are necessary for astrophysical applications.

Recently detailed investigations of helium in the strong ﬁeld regime have been performed, providing the community
with detailed energy levels, transition wavelengths, and transition probabilities, for a dense grid of ﬁeld strengths in
105 T) [21, 22, 23, 24]. Numerous symmetries
the range of 0
and many excited states have been addressed. With the resulting large amount of data it was possible to identify
the absorption edges of the observational spectrum of the magnetic white dwarf GD229 [25, 26, 27], which have been
unexplained for more than 25 years [28, 29].

At this point also the work by Jones et. al [30] should be mentioned. They applied a released-phase quantum
Monte Carlo method in order to evaluate bound state energies and dipole-matrix elements for the ground and a few
excited triplet states. This has been done for a grid of several ﬁeld strengths 0.08

800 a.u.

Addressing the superstrong ﬁeld regime a further challenge is the problem of the ﬁnite nuclear mass. The dominant
energy correction, caused by the ﬁnite nuclear mass is for a ﬁeld of 109 T of the same order of magnitude as the
binding energy itself. This holds even for the energetically lowest states [31]. Therefore eﬀects due to the ﬁnite nuclear

mass have to be taken into account for a correct description of the structure of the atom. Up to date there are no
detailed studies about the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite nuclear mass on the transition rates.

The purpose of the present article is to provide results on the transition probabilities for helium in the superstrong
ﬁeld regime. In Sect. II we review the expressions for the transition matrix elements and analyze the inﬂuence of
the ﬁnite nuclear mass.
In Sect. III we provide our results and discuss some particular features of the transition
probabilities as a function of the ﬁeld strength. Sect. IV provides a brief conclusion and an outlook.

II. ELECTROMAGNETIC TRANSITION PROBABILITIES FOR FINITE NUCLEAR MASS

A detailed comparison of theoretical and observational spectra requires not only the energies and transition wave-
lengths, but also the corresponding oscillator strengths. Selection rules of allowed and forbidden transitions are of
particular importance. Our investigation focuses on the dominant electric dipole transitions. We will shortly review
the derivation of the corresponding operators since there are modiﬁcations due to the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld
as well as the ﬁnite nuclear mass.

Our starting point is the pseudo-separated Hamiltonian [32, 33, 34, 35] using relative coordinates

for the

electrons with respect to the nucleus in atomic units:

Here is MA the total mass of the atom, P denotes the pseudo-momentum, and B the magnetic ﬁeld vector.
On the other hand, we have the operator Hrad describing the interaction of the system with the electromagnetic

radiation ﬁeld Ar, neglecting quadratic terms in Ar. It is given in relative coordinates by

two representations yield in general diﬀerent results. The relative deviation between the two representations is a
good measure for the convergence of the computational method. Only results that obey certain consistency criteria
concerning the length to velocity representations of the transition rates are presented. This ensures in particular the
gauge independence of our results.

In the following we will assume a vanishing pseudo-momentum K, which is an appropriate approximation in case
of slow moving atoms. The basic polarization vectors ǫσ are chosen to be parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld vector, indicated as components z and x
iy. This leads to the following selection rules for the electromagnetic

Here Eq. (19), (20) describe circular and linear polarized transitions, respectively.

To understand the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite nuclear mass we rewrite the expression for the oscillator strength in the

The energy factor (Ef
Ei) plays a signiﬁcant role, as we will see below. One result of Ref.[31] is, that eﬀects of the
mass polarization operators are small and therefore in a good approximation results for ﬁnite nuclear mass can be
expressed in terms of results for inﬁnite nuclear mass:

Here E(M0, γ) denotes the total energy of an eigenstate for the Hamilton operator of the helium atom for nuclear
mass M0 and a ﬁeld strength γ. µ′ := (1
1/M0)−1 is a reduced mass. First we will concentrate on transitions which
do not involve tightly bound states. For the corresponding transitions the last, i.e. third term on the right hand side
of Eq. (23) in general cancels in the energy factor of Eq. (22). As a consequence, there are two generic cases (no tightly

bound states involved) for the inﬂuence of the energy factor (Ef
magnetic quantum numbers Mi and Mf are equal and therefore the energy factor is just scaled by the factor 1/µ′,
compared to the results for an inﬁnite nuclear mass. Typically these oscillator strengths are approximately constant
as a function of the ﬁeld strength. Note that the factor 1/µ′ deviates for helium about 10−4 from 1. In the case

of circular polarized transitions the second term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (23) (

However, the typical oscillator strengths for circular polarized transitions decrease according to a power law. We
note that in case of transitions emanating from tightly bound states the third term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (23) becomes
important and in general modiﬁes the pattern for linear polarized transitions. This is essentially due to the fact that the
energies of magnetically tightly bound states exhibit an inherently diﬀerent ﬁeld dependence than the corresponding
quantity of non tightly bound states. The above discussed behavior will be observed when discussing our results of
oscillator strengths in Sect.III.

Some comments on our computational approach are in order. The calculations are performed using an anisotropic
Gaussian basis set, which was put forward by Schmelcher and Cederbaum [37], and which has been successfully applied
to several atoms, ions and molecules[21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 38, 39, 40, 41]. The corresponding basis functions have been
optimized for each ﬁeld strength to solve the one particle problems, i.e. H and He+ in a magnetic ﬁeld. We refer the
reader to Ref.[31] for more details. It has been shown, that this approach yields accurate energies and in particular
oscillator strength for helium, by comparing with the corresponding data in the literature [21, 22, 23, 24].

III. RESULTS

In this section, we present and discuss our results on the oscillator strengths of electric dipole transitions of helium
in the superstrong ﬁeld regime. In order to label the states, we use the standard spectroscopic notation n2S+1M Πz .
Here 2S + 1 indicates the spin multiplicity, M is the magnetic quantum number, Πz the z parity, and n the degree
of excitation in the corresponding symmetry subspace. The accuracy for the reported oscillator strengths is between
10−4 and a few times 10−2.

As discussed in Ref.[31] the number of bound states of the helium atom in superstrong magnetic ﬁelds becomes
ﬁnite, i.e. the spectrum terminates, if the eﬀects of the ﬁnite nuclear mass are taken into account. Therefore only a
ﬁnite, usually small number of transitions “survive” in the superstrong ﬁeld regime. On the other hand the ionization
He+ + e−) is up to date not known exactly due to missing detailed investigations on the moving
threshold (He
He+ ion in a magnetic ﬁeld. The exact ﬁeld strength for which a certain state becomes unbound is therefore unknown.
Since our basis functions cannot properly describe the electronic continuum we report here only on transitions that
are known to be energetically well-separated enough from the continuum.

The typical features of oscillator strengths of linear polarized transition, discussed in Sect.II, can be clearly seen
in Fig. 1 (a). The oscillator strengths for several transitions stay constant, or change much less than one order of
magnitude. On the other hand transitions emanating from the tightly bound state 110+ can be identiﬁed by their
power law behavior. A completely diﬀerent pattern belongs to the transitions 310+

Let us ﬁrst discuss the oscillator strengths emanating from the singlet states with zero magnetic quantum number
and positive z parity (Fig. 3). With increasing ﬁeld strength the transition wavelengths of some transitions decrease,
3000 ˚A a gap between two groups of oscillator strengths emerges and widens
whereas it increases for others. E.g. at
with increasing ﬁeld strength. The reader should note, that the values of the oscillator strengths correspondingly
decrease. Similar statements hold also for the spectrum of the triplet transitions shown in Fig. 4.

The transition spectrum emanating from the states with magnetic quantum number

1 and negative z parity shows
a completely diﬀerent pattern (see Figs. 5 and 6). The spectra are only reported up to γ = 2000, since above this
ﬁeld strength there are no transitions between bound states including states of the 2S+1(
1)− symmetry. It can be
observed that at γ = 100 there are several very dominant transitions between 103 ˚A and 105 ˚A (up to 6 atomic units).

FIG. 2: The absolute value of the oscillator strength |ff i| of the circular polarized transitions ν 10+ → µ1(−1)+ as a function of
the ﬁeld strength γ. On the left hand side from top to bottom the following transitions are shown (µ, ν) = (1, 1),(1, 2), (2, 2),
(2, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 1), (1, 5), (4, 1), (3, 2), (2, 3), (5, 1), (3, 4), (4, 2), (2, 4), (4, 3), (2, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3).

respectively, only one transitions with an oscillator strengths of the order of one remains.

In Figs. 7 and 8, the spectra for transitions emanating from the 2S+1(

2)+ symmetry subspaces, are presented.
For γ = 100, 200 a.u. the oscillator strength increase (with a few exceptions) monotonically as a function of the
wavelength. For wavelengths of the order of 103 ˚A, we ﬁnd only oscillator strengths much smaller than 1, whereas for
wavelengths in the interval 104

transition of the order of 0.002 atomic units for a wavelength of approximately 102 ˚A remains.

IV. BRIEF CONCLUSIONS

We have applied a full conﬁguration interaction method to the helium atom in the superstrong ﬁeld regime between
100–10 000 atomic units. The eﬀects of the ﬁnite nuclear mass have been taken into account. In this work we have
presented results on the oscillator strengths between bound states. The operators, describing the dominating electric
dipole transitions in the magnetic ﬁeld in ﬁrst order perturbation theory have been derived from ﬁrst principles. It
has been shown how the spectrum changes for diﬀerent symmetries with increasing ﬁeld strength. Finite nuclear mass
eﬀects decrease the number of bound state transitions in the superstrong ﬁeld regime, since many states enter the
continuum beyond a certain critical ﬁeld strength. The inﬂuence of the ﬁnite nuclear mass on the oscillator strength
has been analyzed.

For linear polarized transitions that do not involve tightly bound states the corresponding oscillator strengths are

approximately ﬁeld-independent and, compared to the results for inﬁnite nuclear mass scaled by a factor involving the
reduced mass. For linear polarized transitions involving tightly bound states the oscillator strengths obey a power law
Cγ−λ. A similar statement holds for the circular polarized transitions. Particular linear and circular
decay ff i(γ)
polarized transitions do not belong to these two cases: they show a diﬀerent strongly nonlinear dependence on the
ﬁeld strength.

Our results could be of relevance to the interpretation of spectra of neutron stars. For the future an investigation of
the continuum would be very promising, particular since the discrete spectrum becomes very sparse in a superstrong
ﬁeld. The inclusion of motional electric ﬁelds into our study would also be very desirable. The latter requires however
a major theoretical eﬀort.

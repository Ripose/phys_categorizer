Abstract

The correction to the hydrogen Lamb shift due to the proton electric and magnetic
polarizabilities is expressed analytically through their static values, which are known
from experiment. The numerical value of the correction to the hydrogen 1S state is
− 71 ± 11 ± 7 Hz. Correction to the H-D 1S-2S – isotope shift due to the proton and
neutron polarizabilities is estimated as 53 ± 9 ± 5 Hz.

1. High experimental precision attained in the hydrogen and deuterium spectroscopy
(see, e.g., [1, 2]) stimulates considerable theoretical activity in this ﬁeld.
In particular,
the deuteron polarizability contribution to the Lamb shift in deuterium was calculated in
[3]−[10]. A special feature of these corrections is that they contain logarithm of the ratio
of a typical nuclear excitation energy to the electron mass, ln ¯E/me.

In the present note we consider the problem of the proton polarizability correction to
the Lamb shift in hydrogen. The typical excitation energy for the proton ¯Ep ∼ 300 MeV is
large as compared to other nuclei (to say nothing of the deuteron). So, ln ¯Ep/me is not just
a mere theoretical parameter, it is truly large, about 6 − 7, which makes the logarithmic
approximation quite meaningful quantitatively.

In our calculation we follow closely the approach of [8]. In particular, we use the gauge
A0 = 0 for virtual photons, so that the only nonvanishing components of the photon
propagator are Dim = dim/k2, dim = δim − kikm/ω2 (i, m = 1, 2, 3). The electron-proton
forward scattering amplitude, we are interested in, is

Here lµ = (me, 0, 0, 0) is the electron momentum. The nuclear-spin independent Compton
forward scattering amplitude, which is of interest to us, can be written as

M = ¯α(ω2, k2)E∗E + ¯β(ω2, k2)B∗B = Mmnemen

where ¯α and ¯β are the nuclear electric and magnetic polarizabilities, respectively. The
structure γi(ˆl − ˆk + me)γj in (1) reduces to −ωδij. Perhaps, the most convenient succession
of integrating expression (1) is as follows: the Wick rotation; transforming the integral over
the Euclidean ω to the interval (0, ∞); the substitution k → k ω. Then the integration
over ω is easily performed with the logarithmic accuracy:

The crucial point is that, within the logarithmic approximation, both polarizabilities ¯α and
¯β in the lhs can be taken at ω = 0, k2 = 0. The ﬁnal integration over d3k is trivial.

The resulting eﬀective operator of the electron-proton interaction (equal to −T ) can be

written in the coordinate representation as

V = − αme [ 5 ¯α(0) − ¯β(0) ] ln

δ(r).

This expression applies within the logarithmic accuracy for arbitrary nuclei.
It should
be mentioned that a similar relation for hydrogen was obtained in [11], our numerical
result agrees with theirs. On the other hand, the formula derived in [12] for an arbitrary
nucleus diﬀers from ours (4) by the absence of the magnetic polarizability ¯β(0) only. The
corresponding estimate presented in [3] diﬀers from our result by the factor at ¯αp(0) (2
instead of 5) and by the absence of ¯βp(0). Besides, the authors of [3] (and of [11]) choose
the inverse nucleon radius, instead of the excitation energy, for the logarithmic cut-oﬀ in
the corresponding formulae.

The experimental data on the proton polarizabilities, which follow from the Compton

scattering, can be summarized as follows [13]:

¯αp(0) + ¯βp(0) = (14.2 ± 0.5) × 10−4 fm

¯αp(0) − ¯βp(0) = (10.0 ± 1.8) × 10−4 fm

The errors are added in quadratures.

Here the ﬁrst error is that of the logarithmic approximation, which we estimate as 15%.
The second one originates from the values of the polarizabilities.

2. Though being calculated rather accurately from the theoretical point of view, the
correction (7) to the hydrogen Lamb shift is too small to be detected experimentally.

However, the corresponding eﬀect in the H-D 1S-2S isotope shift is comparable with the
experimental accuracy (150 Hz) attained for it [2]. This eﬀect is comparable also with
the theoretical precision (70 Hz) for the contribution of the deuteron polarizability due to
relative motion of the proton and neutron to the deuterium Lamb shift [10].

The deuteron is a weakly bound system. Then it is natural to assume that deuteron
polarizability is the sum of the polarizability due to relative motion of the nucleons and the
internal polarizabilities of the nucleons. Simple physical arguments, supported by model es-
timates, demonstrate that nucleon polarizabilities in deuteron coincide with polarizabilities
for free nucleons, well within the accuracy of our logarithmic approximation. Therefore, in
the corresponding eﬀect in the H-D isotope shift the proton contributions cancel, and we
are left with that of a neutron (with opposite sign)

δVH−D = αme ( 5αn(0) − βn(0) ) ln

δ(r).

The neutron electric polarizability is [14]

αn(0) = (9.8 ± 1.3 ± 0.7) × 10−4 fm

Its magnetic polarizability βn is not known. Under the assumption that βn does not change
the result considerably, this contribution to the diﬀerence between the Lamb shifts of the
ground states of hydrogen and deuterium is

The corresponding contribution to the isotope shift between hydrogen and deuterium

1S-2S transition due to the internal polarizabilities of the nucleons can be estimated as

61 ± 10 ± 6Hz.

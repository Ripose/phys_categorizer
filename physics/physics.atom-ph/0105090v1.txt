6p3/2 transition in 205Tl. Our result for the reduced matrix element is E1PNC = −(66.7 ±

I.

INTRODUCTION

The thallium atom is the second simplest atom where
parity non-conservation (PNC) has been observed [1, 2].
The simplest and best understood such atom is cesium,
where theory has the accuracy of 1% [3, 4] (see also more
recent calculations [5, 6, 7]). That, together with the best
experimental result for Cs [8] allowed one to obtain the
most accurate result for the weak charge of the cesium
nucleus [6, 7]:

QW (133Cs) =
W (133Cs) =
QSM

where Eq. (2) is the standard model prediction given in
Ref. [9]. Note, that these two values are in agreement
with each other. Recently there has been some discussion
of the accuracy of the theory for Cs;
in Ref. [10] the
accuracy of the theoretical amplitude in Cs was estimated
to be 0.4%, but at present there seems to be a consensus
that it is closer to 1%.

In this paper, we report a new calculation of the PNC
6p3/2 transition in thal-
E1-amplitude for the 6p1/2 →
lium. Combining this new calculation with the most ac-
curate experiment [1], leads to a value of the weak charge
of the 205Tl nucleus that can also be compared with the
standard model prediction [9]:

Again, these two values are in agreement with each other.
The atomic theory involved in both calculations is sim-
ilar, as are the possible sources of theoretical uncer-
tainty. That can possibly explain why the central values
in Eq. (1) and Eq. (3) are shifted in the same direction

from the standard model predictions (note that in both
cases the theoretical uncertainty dominates the experi-
mental one).

The structure of this paper is as follows: In Sec. II
we brieﬂy describe the method of the calculation. More
details can be found in Refs. [11, 12, 13]. Results of our
calculation and a discussion of its accuracy are given in
Sec. III. Our conclusions are summarized in Sec. IV.

II. CALCULATIONAL DETAILS

One important diﬀerence between thallium and cesium
is that the former atom has three valence electrons above
a relatively compact and rigid core, while the latter has
only one. Correlations between three valence electrons
are not small and can not be treated accurately by many-
body perturbation theory (MBPT). In Ref. [11], it was
suggested that MBPT be combined with the conﬁgura-
tion interaction (CI) method for such atoms. The latter
method is well suited to account for correlations between
a few valence electrons, while the former method allows
one to treat core-valence and core-core correlations. This
combined CI+MBPT method was ﬁrst tested in calcula-
tions of energy spectra of Tl [11], then for Ca, Sr, Ba,
and Yb [14]. Later it was extended to the calculations of
observable such as hyperﬁne structure constants [12] and
polarizabilities [13].

There is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in MBPT for one-
electron atoms, such as Cs, and three-electron atoms
such as Tl. For one-electron atoms one has to calculate
only MBPT diagrams with one external line, while for
many-electron atoms there are also diagrams with two,
three, and more external lines. For combinatorial rea-
sons the number of such diagrams grows rapidly with the
number of external lines, making calculations for many-
electron atoms much more complicated. Fortunately, the
three-particle diagrams appear to be small for Tl [11].
If the three-particle diagrams are neglected, the eﬀective
Hamiltonian for valence electrons is a two-particle oper-

ator, which not only drastically reduces the number of
diagrams at the MBPT stage of the calculation, but is
also essential for the CI stage of the calculation because
the Hamiltonian matrix remains sparse.

It was recently shown for Cs [5, 6, 7] that the Breit
interaction correction is larger than earlier estimated [4].
For this reason we have included the dominant magnetic
part of the Breit interaction (the so-called Gaunt in-
teraction) at all stages of the present calculation. The
Dirac-Fock equations were solved in the Coulomb-Gaunt
approximation for the ground state of the Tl+ ion (the
V N −1 approximation) with the help of the code described
in Ref. [15].

We used diﬀerent basis sets for the CI and MBPT parts
of the calculation. That enabled us to improve the CI
convergence without having an enormous Hamiltonian
matrix. The core and valence orbitals were taken from
the numerical solution of the Dirac-Fock equations on a
radial grid. The CI basis set included virtual orbitals
formed using the method suggested in Ref. [16], while
virtual states for the MBPT basis set were formed from
B-splines [17]. The Dirac-Fock Coulomb-Gaunt Hamil-
tonian was diagonalized on both sets. Two diﬀerent vari-
ants of the MBPT basis set were used for calculating di-
agrams for the eﬀective Hamiltonian and for solving the
RPA equations. The former included partial waves with
l = 5, while the latter included more orbitals but was
restricted to l

2.

We use the Brillouin-Wigner variant of MBPT. In this
formalism, the eﬀective Hamiltonian for the valence elec-
trons is symmetric but energy-dependent. It was shown
earlier [18] that the accuracy of the theory can be im-
proved by calculating the Hamiltonian at shifted ener-
gies. The optimal valence energy for Tl was found to be

−

1.64 a.u..
For some observables such as polarizabilities, Stark-
induced amplitudes and PNC amplitudes, one needs to
sum over intermediate states or solve the corresponding
inhomogeneous equations (Sternheimer [19] or Dalgarno-
Lewis [20] method). Here we apply the Sternheimer-
Dalgarno-Lewis method to the valence part of the prob-
lem as described in [13, 21].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Test Calculations of the Spectrum and
Observables.

To control the accuracy of our calculation of the PNC
amplitude, we calculated as many diﬀerent observables
as possible. These results are presented in Tables I –
IV. There are some diﬀerences with earlier calculations
[11, 12]. Firstly, we use the Coulomb-Gaunt potential
here instead of the Coulomb potential used in those ear-
lier calculations. In Table I, we compare our theoretical
Coulomb-Gaunt energies with the measured spectrum.
We also give Coulomb energies for comparison. One can

see that the Gaunt correction to the ﬁne structure is
rather large, especially for the ground state. Both split-
tings 6p1/2–6p3/2 and 7p1/2–7p3/2 are signiﬁcantly im-
proved when the Gaunt interaction is included. The over-
all agreement with experiment is also improved, though
not as dramatically.

Tables II and III present results of our calculations of
hyperﬁne structure constants and E1-amplitudes. In Ta-
ble II, we list all corrections to the initial Dirac-Fock val-
ues of hyperﬁne constants. The CI correction accounts
for mixing of conﬁgurations. The Heﬀ correction cor-
responds to the solution of the CI equations with the
eﬀective Hamiltonian and accounts for core polarization
eﬀects. The remaining corrections correspond to the dif-
ferent terms in the eﬀective operator of the hyperﬁne in-
teraction [12]. In this calculation we included the struc-
tural radiation (ASR) correction [26], which was omitted
in [12]. The most important contributions are associated
with the RPA and the Brueckner (Aσ) corrections to the
eﬀective operator. Two other large contributions from
subtraction (Asbt) and two-particle corrections (Atp) al-

most cancel each other.

One can see that the Dirac-Fock approximation for the
hyperﬁne constants works reasonably well only for 6p1/2
and 7p1/2 levels. For some of the other levels, even the
sign and order of magnitude of the constants are wrong.
That aﬀects the ﬁnal accuracy of the theory, which is
better than 2% for the np1/2 levels, about 3% for the 7s
level, and worse for other small constants. It is actually
quite surprising, that the CI+MBPT method gives rather
accurate values even when the Dirac-Fock approximation
fails completely.

The MBPT corrections to the E1 amplitudes in the
length gauge are much smaller than for the hyperﬁne
constants and the ﬁnal values are closer to the initial
Dirac-Fock ones. Usually, the V -form of the E1 ampli-
tude is less accurate for the optical transitions in neutral
atoms. Therefore, we used the L-form for the calcula-
tions presented in Table III. Accurate experimental re-
7s amplitudes. For
sults are available only for the npj →
these four amplitudes the diﬀerence between theory and
experiment is within 2%. Taking into account the small-
ness of the MBPT corrections to the E1 amplitudes, we
assume this to be the characteristic accuracy of the the-
ory for E1 amplitudes.

As an additional test of the theory, we calculated the
tensor polarizability of the 6p3/2 level, which was accu-
rately measured by Gould [31] (see Table IV). The con-
tribution to the polarizability was calculated by solving
the inhomogeneous equation for the eﬀective operators in

the valence space. The core contribution was calculated
as a direct sum of the RPA amplitudes over Dirac-Fock
virtual orbitals. When calculating the polarizability of
the core of the neutral atom, we should exclude occupied
states from the sum over the intermediate states. The
corresponding correction is given in the column δCore of
Table IV. The 3.5% diﬀerence between theory and ex-
periment for α2(6p3/2) is in agreement with our estimate
of the theoretical accuracy of the E1 amplitudes.

We have omitted all three particle diagrams in the ef-
fective Hamiltonian. These diagrams are strongly sup-
pressed by the small overlap between valence and core
orbitals [11]. We calculated these diagrams for the small
number of leading conﬁgurations and determined correc-
tions to the energies and to the hyperﬁne constants. The
10−4 a.u. and corrections
valence energies changed by
to the hyperﬁne constants were on the order of a few
MHz, conﬁrming that three particle corrections for Tl are
well below the accuracy of the present calculation. We,
therefore, neglected three-particle diagrams in all other
calculations.

B. PNC Amplitude.

charge of the nucleus has the form:

·

10−14 a.u. is the Fermi constant of
where GF = 2.2225
the weak interaction, γ5 is the Dirac matrix, and ρ(r)
is the neutron density of the nucleus. Calculation of the
PNC amplitude is similar to calculation of polarizabili-
ties. Firstly, we must determine the eﬀective operator
HP,eﬀ for the PNC interaction of the valence electrons
with the nucleus in the same way that we determined
eﬀective operators for the hyperﬁne interaction and the
electric dipole moment operators. We must then solve
the RPA equations for the operator (5), calculate the
Brueckner HP,σ, subtraction HP,sbt, two-particle HP,tp,
and structural radiation HP,SR corrections.

Once the eﬀective operators are formed, we solve two

inhomogeneous equations:

Alternatively, instead of (6) and (7) we can solve in-

Equations (8) and (9) should give identical results; a com-
parison of results obtained using the two equivalent meth-
ods can be used to check numerical accuracy of the cal-
culations. On the other hand, it is easier to calculate the
two-particle part of the operator HP,eﬀ using Eq. (9) and
the two-particle part of the operator Deﬀ using Eq. (8).
The results of the calculation based on Eqs. (6) — (8)
are given in Table V. The inhomogeneous equations (6)
and (7) do not account for the sum over intermediate core
states. This sum was calculated explicitly in the RPA ap-
proximation and the corresponding results are also given
in Table V.

a. Accuracy of the calculation. The principal the-
oretical uncertainty in calculations for atoms such as
Tl is associated with higher orders in the residual two-
electron interaction. The eﬀective operator method ac-
counts for some important higher-order MBPT correc-
tions. The valence-valence correlations are considered
non-perturbatively within the CI method. In addition,
by diagonalizing the eﬀective Hamiltonian, we account
for Brueckner and screening correction to all orders. The
RPA equations for the PNC and the electric-dipole inter-
actions eﬀectively sum inﬁnite chains of diagrams. How-
ever, already in third-order MBPT, there are diagrams
that are neglected here.

It is known that for neutral atoms, the residual two-
electron interaction is not small and it is very diﬃcult
to estimate the accuracy of diﬀerent approximate meth-
ods. Therefore, we made a number of test calculations
described above. We have seen that, even for hyper-
ﬁne structure constants where the MBPT corrections
are huge, the accuracy of the theory for the large con-
stants is still about 2 – 3%, while for the E1 amplitudes
the accuracy is better than 2%. According to Table V,

4

the MBPT corrections to the PNC amplitude are rather
small. Therefore, we estimate the error caused by the ne-
glect of the higher-order terms in the residual interaction
to be about 2%.

The other possible sources of errors are QED correc-
tions and the nuclear size eﬀects. Below, we discuss both
of them in some detail.

b. QED corrections to PNC amplitude. The most
important radiative corrections to the PNC interaction
given in Eq. (5) correspond to very small distances
and should be calculated within the electroweak theory.
These corrections lead to scaling of the weak charge of
the nucleus. The leading-order (tree-level) value of the
weak charge for 205Tl is:

QW (0) =

N + Z(1

4 sin2 θW ) =

117.9, (10)

−

−

−

where N and Z are the numbers of neutrons and protons
in the nucleus. The Weinberg angle θW here is taken
at the energy of Z-pole. Radiative corrections change
QW (0) by 1%; the resulting value, taken from Ref. [9], is
given in Eq. (4).

In addition to these radiative corrections, there are
the QED radiative corrections speciﬁc to heavy atoms
[32, 33]. These corrections are dominated by vacuum-
polarization eﬀects and for hydrogen-like ions with Z
≈
80 were calculated to be 0.9% [33]. For the valence
electron of a neutral atom, screening of the vacuum-
polarization potential by relaxation of the core should
be taken into account.
It was recently shown that for
the Breit interaction this screening signiﬁcantly reduces
corrections to the valence amplitudes [6, 7, 34]. Thus,
the actual radiative corrections to the PNC amplitude in
Tl could be few times smaller.

Finally, there is the Breit correction to the PNC am-
plitude. The magnetic part of the Breit interaction (the
Gaunt interaction) is known to be larger than the ne-
glected retardation part of the Breit operator [34] by a
factor of three or more. As we pointed out above, the
Gaunt interaction should be included self-consistently at
all stages of calculations.
It is diﬃcult to isolate the
Gaunt correction in the self-consistent approach. To do
that, one must repeat all calculations in the Coulomb ap-
proximation and take a diﬀerence. The calculations for
Tl are rather time consuming, so for the Coulomb case
we did only the CI calculation. At that level of approxi-
mation, the Gaunt correction to the PNC amplitude was
about
0.5%. We think that the overall Gaunt correc-
tion may be up to two times larger. The retardation cor-
rection, which is neglected here, should be at least few
times smaller than the Gaunt correction and the total
uncertainty from QED eﬀects should be within 1%.

−

c. Nuclear size eﬀects. The PNC amplitude is sensi-
tive to both proton and neutron distributions: the former
determines electronic wave function inside the nucleus
and the latter determines the weak charge distribution in
Eq. (5). In our calculations we approximate the nucleus
10−3 a.u.
205Tl by a uniform ball of the radius 0.1334

·

5

This value corresponds to a root-mean-square charge ra-
dius rN = 5.470(5) fm [35].

This model assumes that (i) proton and neutron radii
of the nucleus are the same: r(p)
N = rN, and (ii)
the nucleus has a sharp edge. Generally speaking, both
assumptions are incorrect. Therefore, it is important to
estimate the errors associated with each of them. That
was recently done in Refs. [36, 37]:

N = r(n)

These two calculations account for diﬀerent correlation
eﬀects, but give very close results. In general, the am-
plitudes for the allowed M 1-transitions are very stable
and can be calculated quite reliably. The experimen-
tal value of this amplitude follows from the measure-
ments of the quadrupole amplitude E2 [39] and the ratio

the nuclear distribution. For a real nucleus, η is about

These experimental results formally contradict one an-
other. Recently, Majumder and Tsai suggested [40] that
the discrepancy could be due to the diﬀerent values of the
parameter χ used in the analysis by two groups. They ac-
curately measured χ (17) and used their value to rescale
the experimental result from Ref. [2] to ﬁnd

Our ﬁnal value for the PNC amplitude of the 6p1/2 →
6p3/2 transition is in good agreement with the most ac-
curate previous calculation of Dzuba et al. [26] (the ref-
erences to earlier calculations can be found in [38]):

In the experiment the following ratio is measured:

This scaled value is in agreement with the measurement
[1], where a nearly identical value of χ was used, and all
three values are in agreement with the theoretical result
(18) for the QW = QSM
W . We use the best experimental
result [1] together with our calculation (18) to derive the
experimental value of the weak charge for 205Tl:

Abstract. In 2003 we have measured the absolute frequency of the (1S, F = 1, mF =
′
±1) ↔ (2S, F
F = ±1) two-photon transition in atomic hydrogen. We observed
a variation of (−29 ± 57) Hz over a 44 months interval separating this measurement
from the previous one performed in 1999. We have combined this result with recently
published results of optical transition frequency measurement in the 199Hg+ ion and
and comparison between clocks based on 87Rb and 133Cs. From this combination we
deduce the stringent limits for fractional time variation of the ﬁne structure constant
−1 and for the ratio of 87Rb and 133Cs spin mag-
∂/∂t(ln α) = (−0.9 ± 4.2) × 10
netic moments ∂/∂t(ln[µRb/µCs]) = (0.5 ± 2.1) × 10−15 yr−1. This is the ﬁrst precise
restriction for the fractional time variation of α made without assumptions about the
relative drifts of the constants of electromagnetic, strong and weak interactions.

1 Introduction

The question of constancy of fundamental constants stems from Dirac’s ”Large
Number hypothesis” (1937) which aimed for a harmonization of basic laws of
physics [1]. Since then, this hypothesis has been reviewed and extended by many
other scientists opening a broad ﬁeld for theoretical and experimental investi-
gations. As there is no accepted theory predicting the values of fundamental
constants, the question of their possible time variation belongs mostly to the
ﬁeld of experimental physics. The last decades saw a number of diﬀerent astro-
physical, geological, and laboratory tests searching for their possible variation in
diﬀerent time epochs with an ever increasing accuracy. From the point of view
of its importance for physics in general, this problem stays on the same level as
the testing of the CP T -symmetry and the search for the electric dipole moment
of elementary particles.

M. Fischer et al.

In all metric theories of gravity including general relativity any drift of non-
gravitational constants is forbidden. This axiom bases on Einstein’s Equivalence
Principle (EEP) postulating that (i) the weight of a body is proportional to
its mass, (ii) the result of any non-gravitational measurement is independent
on the velocity of the laboratory rest-frame (local Lorentz invariance), and (iii)
the result of a non-gravitational measurement is independent on its time and
position in this frame (local time and position invariance). On the other side,
theories towards a uniﬁed description of quantum mechanics and gravity allow
for, or even predict some violations of EEP. In this sense, any experimental
search for a drift of fundamental constants tests the validity of EEP as well as
it provides important constraints on new theoretical models.

The basic principle of all the tests of the stability of fundamental constants is
the investigation of time variations of some stable physical value Θ. Usually, Θ
is the dimensionless value which can be a ratio between reaction cross-sections,
some distances, masses, magnetic moments frequencies and so on. In an exper-
iment one measures the value Θ at two diﬀerent times t1 and t2 and compares
Θ(t1) with Θ(t2). The value of Θ may depend on a number of fundamental
constants αi (i = 1, . . . n) and the conclusions about drifts of αi originate from
the analysis of the Θ(t1) − Θ(t2) diﬀerence. The functional connection between
Θ and αi can include rather complicated theoretical models and assumptions
which make the results somehow unclear and strongly model-dependent. Even
if the dependence Θ(αi) is straightforward, it is diﬃcult to separate the con-
tributions from individual αi drifts if n > 1. As mentioned in Ref. [2], all the
relative drifts of fundamental constants, if existing, should be on the same level
of magnitude which can result in a cancellation of the drift of Θ as well as in its
ampliﬁcation. For example, according to an elaborate scenario in the framework
of a Grand Uniﬁcation Theory, a fractional time variation of hadron masses and
their magnetic moments should change about 38 times faster as a fractional time
variation of the ﬁne structure constant α [3].

Astrophysical and geological methods test the stability of fundamental con-
stants over very long time intervals of 1–10 Gyr. Due to a large diﬀerence of
|t1 − t2|, the sensitivity of these methods to a monotonic long-time drift is very
high but it is insensitive to more rapid ﬂuctuations. A recent analysis of quasar
spectra with redshifted UV transition lines indicates for a variation of α on the
level of ∆α/α = (−0.543 ± 0.116) × 10−5 in the ﬁrst third of the evolution of the
universe (5–11 Gyr ago) [4]. There are also indications that then the electron to
proton mass ratio was diﬀerent from its contemporary value on the same level
of 10−5 [5]. The analysis of astrophysical data requires a number of model as-
sumptions which include not only the well-established scenarios of the universe
evolution, but also some suggestions like isotopic abundance in interstellar gas
clouds, the presence of magnetic ﬁelds and others (see e.g. the review [6]) which
are diﬃcult to prove.

A very stringent limit for a variation of α on geological timescales follows from
the analysis of isotope ratios in the natural ﬁssion reactor of Oklo, Gabon, which
operated about 2 Gyr ago. A recent re-analysis of the data on the 149Sm/147Sm

Precision Spectroscopy of Atomic Hydrogen

isotope ratio sets a limit of ∆α/α = (−0.36 ± 1.44) × 10−8 [7]. The interpreta-
tion of the data is not unambiguous, as the result strongly depends on reactor
operating conditions which are not exactly known. Selecting another possible
reaction branch yields a value of ∆α/α = (9.8 ± 0.8) × 10−8 [7]. In contrast to
the ﬁrst one, this result indicates for a non-zero drift.

Laboratory experiments are sensitive to variations of fundamental constants
during the last few years and typically base on precise frequency measurements
in atomic or molecular systems. In comparison to astrophysical and geological
ones, laboratory measurements considerably win in relative accuracy which, in
spite of much shorter |t1 − t2| time intervals, leads to a competitive sensitivity on
drifts. Moreover, in this case systematic eﬀects are well controlled and the fre-
quency dependence on fundamental constants is straightforward. Any absolute
frequency measurement of some transition in atomic system means a compari-
son of this frequency with the frequency of the ground state hyperﬁne transition
in 133Cs. Such a measurement of one transition frequency in one atomic sys-
tem imposes a limit on variation of some simple combination of α, nuclear and
electron magnetic moments and/or their masses [2]. To extract the drift of the
ﬁne-structure constant one needs either to impose some restrictions on the time
dependence of the constants of strong (αS) and electroweak (αW ) interactions
[3] or make absolute measurements of two or more transition frequencies pos-
sessing diﬀerent functional dependencies on fundamental constants. The second
method does not include any model parameters or additional assumptions which
favorably distinguishes it from all other. It is also possible to make such a model-
independent evaluation comparing directly e.g. gross- and ﬁne structure or two
gross-structure frequencies without comparison to the primary frequency stan-
dard and thus excluding the corresponding dependence on the nuclear magnetic
moments. To our knowledge, such laboratory experiments still have not been
done on a proper level of accuracy.

We deduce separate stringent limits for the relative drifts of the ﬁne struc-
ture constant α and the ratio µCs/µB by combining the results of two optical
frequency measurements in the hydrogen atom and in the mercury ion with re-
spect to the ground state hyperﬁne splitting in 133Cs. The measurements of the
hydrogen transition frequency have been carried out at MPQ, Garching, and are
described below. The experiments on the drift of the 5d106s 2S1/2(F = 0) ↔
5d96s2 2D5/2(F ′ = 2, m′
F = 0) electric quadrupole transition frequency νHg in
199Hg+ have been performed by the group of J. Bergquist at NIST between July
2000 and December 2002. They are described in detail elsewhere [8].

From 1999 to 2003, the ratio between the ground state hyperﬁne splittings
of 87Rb and 133Cs has been determined from a comparison between several
simultaneously running atomic fountain clocks in Paris [9]. Using this result, we
can also set a limit for the fractional time variation of the Rb and Cs nuclear
magnetic moment ratio µRb/µCs.

As the measurements were performed at diﬀerent places and at diﬀerent
time points we have to use the hypothesis, that the result of measurement is
independent from the place on the Earths orbit, at least within the last 4 years.

4

M. Fischer et al.

In other words, we have to assume a validity of the local Lorentz invariance (LLI)
and local position invariance (LPI) as well as to make an additional hypothesis,
that the constants change on a cosmological time scale and do not oscillate within
few years. With this exception, our results are independent of any further model
assumptions of drifts of fundamental constants.

2 Hydrogen spectrometer

In 1999 [10] and 2003, the frequency of the (1S, F = 1, mF = ±1) ↔ (2S, F ′ =
1, m′
F = ±1) two-photon transition in atomic hydrogen has been phase coher-
ently compared to the frequency of the ground state hyperﬁne splitting in 133Cs
using a high-resolution hydrogen spectrometer and a frequency comb technique
[11]. In 1999, the accuracy of the evaluation of the transition frequency was
1.8 × 10−14. The setup of the hydrogen spectrometer used during this measure-
ment has been described previously in [12]. We have introduced a number of
improvements in the spectroscopic setup which will be described in the follow-
ing. A sketch of the actual setup is shown in Fig.1.

A cw dye laser emitting near 486 nm is locked to an external reference cavity.
The cavity used during the 1999 measurement was made from Zerodur and had
a typical drift of 25 Hz s−1 at the fundamental frequency. The new cavity made
from Ultra Low Expansion (ULE) glass for the 2003 measurement is better

shielded against the environment. Its drift has been less than 0.5 Hz s−1 for
the entire time of the measurement. Due to the better thermal and acoustic
isolation and improvements in the laser lock electronic, the laser linewidth is
narrower than it has been in 1999. An upper limit for the laser linewidth has
been deduced from an investigation of the beat signal between two laser ﬁelds
locked separately to independent Zerodur and ULE cavities. The spectrum of
12 averaged scans, each taken in 0.2 s is represented in Fig.2(left). The width of
this beat signal spectrum is equal to 120 Hz at a laser wavelength of 486 nm.
Yet it is impossible to distinguish between the individual noise contributions
from the two independent, but not equivalent cavities. Another restriction can
be deduced from the analysis of the 1S-2S transition spectra. The linewidth
of the transition is mainly deﬁned by time-of-ﬂight broadening and is between
1 kHz and 5 kHz at 121 nm. The residual linewidth obtained after subtracting
the estimated contribution of time-of ﬂight broadening is plotted on Fig.2(right)
versus the intensity of the excitation light. The observed broadening is due to
the ionization processes which correspond to a reduced lifetime of the metastable
excited atoms. Extrapolating the residual linewidth to zero intensity, we get
240(30) Hz at 121 nm. This can be considered as a contribution from laser
frequency ﬂuctuations. Thus, we evaluate the 486 nm laser linewidth as 60 Hz
for averaging times of 1 s.

A small part of the laser light is transferred to the neighboring laboratory
where its absolute frequency can be measured. The main part is frequency dou-
bled in a BBO crystal. For higher conversion eﬃciency, the crystal is placed in
a folded enhancement cavity. The resulting 20 mW of radiation near 243 nm
(corresponding to half of the 1S-2S transition frequency) is coupled into a linear
enhancement cavity inside the vacuum chamber of the hydrogen spectrometer.
Molecular hydrogen is dissociated in a 15 W, 2.5 GHz radio-frequency gas
discharge. The resulting ﬂow of atomic hydrogen is cooled by inelastic collisions

with the walls of a copper nozzle having the temperature of 5-7 K. The nozzle
forms a beam of cold atomic hydrogen which leaves it collinearly with the cavity
axis and enters the interaction region between the nozzle and the Lα-detector.
This region is shielded from stray electric ﬁelds by a Faraday cage. Some of the
atoms are excited from the ground state to the metastable 2S state by Doppler-
free absorption of two counter propagating photons from the laser ﬁeld in the
enhancement cavity. After the 1999 measurement which had been performed
at a background gas pressure of around 10−6 mbar in the interaction region,
we have upgraded the vacuum system to a diﬀerential pumping conﬁguration.
This allowe us to vary the background gas pressure between around 10−8 and
10−7 mbar in 2003 and to reduce the background gas pressure shift and the
corresponding uncertainty down to 2 Hz.

Due to small apertures, only atoms ﬂying close to the cavity axis can enter
the detection region where the 2S atoms are quenched in a small electric ﬁeld
and emit Lα-photons. The excitation light and the hydrogen beam are periodi-
cally blocked by two phase locked choppers operating at 160 Hz frequency, and
the Lα-photons are counted time-resolved only in the dark period of a cycle.
This eliminates the background counts from the excitation light. The delay ∆t
between blocking the 243 nm radiation and the start of counting sets an up-
per limit on the velocity of the atoms which contribute to the signal. For some
deﬁnite ∆t only atoms with velocities v < d/∆t are selected, where d is the
distance between nozzle and detector. Therefore, velocity dependent systematic
eﬀects such as the second-order Doppler shift and the time-of-ﬂight broadening
are smaller for spectra recorded at higher ∆t. The hydrogen beam is blocked
by a fork chopper in less then 200 µs after the blocking of the excitation light
to prevent slow atoms from being blown away by fast atoms that emerge sub-
sequently from the nozzle. With the help of a multi-channel scaler, we count all
photons and sort them into 12 equidistant time bins. From each scan of the laser
frequency over the hydrogen 1S-2S resonance we therefore get 12 spectra at dif-
ferent delays. To correct for the second order Doppler shift, we use an elaborated
theoretical model [13] to ﬁt all the delayed spectra of one scan simultaneously

with one set of 7 ﬁt parameters (see Fig.3). The result of the ﬁtting procedure
is the 1S-2S transition frequency for the hydrogen atom at rest.

Besides the second order Doppler eﬀect, the other dominating systematic ef-
fect is the dynamic AC-Stark shift which shifts the transition frequency linearly
with the excitation light intensity. We have varied the intensity and extrapo-
late the transition frequency to zero intensity to correct for it [10]. A typical
set of data taken within one day of measurement 2003 and the corresponding
extrapolation is presented in Fig.3 (right).

3 Frequency measurement

For an absolute measurement of the 1S-2S transition frequency in terms of Hz,
the frequency of the dye laser near 616.5 THz (486 nm) was phase coherently
compared with an atomic cesium fountain clock [9]. To bridge the large gap be-
tween the optical- and radio-frequency (RF) domains we took advantage of the
recently developed femtosecond laser frequency comb technique incorporating
a highly nonlinear glass ﬁber, which allows for a further simpliﬁcation of the
experimental setup as compared to the measurement performed in 1999. In this
section we give an introduction of the frequency comb technique and a descrip-
tion of the experimental setup, which was used for 1S-2S frequency measurement
in 2003.

The pulse train emitted by a suﬃciently stable mode locked femtosecond (fs)
laser equals a comb of cw laser modes in the frequency domain. The frequency
of each mode of this comb can be written as fn = nfrep + fceo, where frep is
the pulse repetition rate of the fs laser, n is an integer number and fceo is the
so-called carrier envelope oﬀset frequency [14].

The fs laser emits a train of pulses with a repetition rate frep = 1/T , where T
is the time between consecutive pulses. The envelope function of the pulses has
the periodicity of frep, but it does not necessarily mean, that the electrical ﬁeld
of the pulses has the same periodicity. Only when the phase delay of the fs laser
modes equals the group delay inside the cavity, have the pulses an identical ﬁeld
(Fig.4 top). In this case not only the envelope function but also the electrical
ﬁeld has the periodicity of frep. This leads to a Fourier spectrum fn = nfrep,
where all the modes are exact multiples of frep. Generally, the group delay does
not equal the phase delay inside the cavity and the frequencies fn can not be
integer multiples of frep (Fig.4 bottom). Denoting the phase shift between the
envelope function and the carrier frequency of consecutive pulses as ∆ϕ one can
show, that the frequencies can be written as:

fn = nfrep + fceo
∆ϕ
2π

with

fceo < frep .

If frep and fceo are given, all the modes of the frequency comb are determined
and can be used for measuring the frequency of cw laser light via beat notes
between the cw laser light and a comb mode. The large gap between the RF

and the optical domains is bridged due to the fact, that n is a large integer
number of the order of 106. To use the frequency comb for high precision optical
frequency measurements one has to link frep and fceo phase coherently to a
Cs primary frequency standard. The Cs clock provides us with an extremely
precise reference frequency to control frep and fceo. The pulse repetition rate
frep is easily measured with a photodiode and controlled via the length of the fs
laser cavity, which can be changed by means of a piezo-mounted fs laser cavity
mirror. In general, fceo can be controlled by adjusting the pump power of the fs
laser [15,16]. In the case of a linear laser cavity with a prism pair to compensate
for the group velocity dispersion fceo can also be controlled by tilting the end
mirror of the dispersive arm of the laser cavity [14]. The problem which was
challenging for a long time was to measure fceo. If the spectrum of the optical
frequency comb covers an entire octave, fceo is most conveniently determined by
frequency doubling fn modes on the low frequency side of the comb spectrum
and comparing the result with modes f2n on the high frequency side via a beat
note measurement [16,17]:

2fn − f2n = 2(nfrep + fceo) − (2nfrep + fceo) = fceo .

(2)

If the spectrum does not cover an entire octave, one can alternatively compare
2 fceo [11,14] or 3f2n with 2f3n to obtain fceo [18,19]. The

broad spectra needed for this technique are either directly emitted by the fs
laser [20,21] or can be obtained by external broadening in a highly nonlinear
medium such as a photonic crystal ﬁber (PCF) [22,23]. A PCF as pictured in
Fig.5 can be designed to have zero group velocity dispersion (GVD) at 800 nm,
which is the central wavelength of commonly used Ti:sapphire fs lasers. Due to
the vanishing GVD the pulse spreading within the PCF is lower than in usual
ﬁbers. The resulting high peak intensity leads to self phase modulation and
therefore eﬃcient broadening of the initial frequency comb.

If frep and fceo are stabilized by phase coherently linking them to a RF
reference, the accuracy of the RF reference is in one step transferred to all the cw
modes of the octave spanning optical frequency comb. Using state-of-the-art Cs
fountain clocks, which already reach accuracies of 10−15 [9], the frequency of an
unknown light ﬁeld can in principle be measured with the same level of accuracy.
Moreover the fs frequency comb technique was tested to be accurate at the
< 10−16 level by comparing two independent systems [16,24]. To determine an
optical frequency fopt one only needs to measure the frequency fbeat of the beat
note between the unknown light ﬁeld with the frequency fopt and the neighboring
mode fn of the frequency comb. The unknown frequency fopt can then be written
as:

fopt = fn + fbeat = nfrep + fceo + fbeat .

(3)

The mode number n may be determined by a coarse measurement of fopt with a
commercial wavemeter. Using the fs frequency comb technique optical frequency
measurements have been carried out on atoms and ions, demonstrating accura-
cies of up to 10−14 [10,25–27]. An experimental setup for detecting fceo, frep
and fbeat using an octave broad frequency comb is shown in Fig.6.

10

M. Fischer et al.

Another application of fs frequency combs is the determination of optical
frequency ratios. As a frequency ratio has no unit, no RF reference based on Cs
is needed and one can take advantage of the high stability and accuracy of optical
frequency standards, which should lead to an increased sensitivity to the drift of
fundamental constants [27]. Due to the invention of photonic crystal ﬁbers the
complexity of the frequency measurement in 2003 has been considerably reduced
as compared to the 1999 experiment, where a fs laser was used already. The
experimental setup used in 2003 to measure the frequency of the hydrogen dye
laser was equivalent to that shown in Fig.6 and employed a fs Ti:sapphire ring
laser (GigaOptics, model GigaJet) with 800 MHz repetition rate. The spectrum
of the fs laser was externally broadened with the help of a PCF to more than
one octave ranging from 946 nm to 473 nm. The detection of the repetition
rate frep was placed in front of the microstructured ﬁber to be not aﬀected by
amplitude noise caused by imperfect ﬁber coupling. frep was phase locked to a
800 MHz signal which was directly derived from the transportable Cs fountain
clock FOM. For both the 1999 and 2003 measurements, the transportable Cs
fountain clock FOM has been installed in MPQ. Its stability is 1.8 × 10−13τ −1/2
and its accuracy has been evaluated to 8 × 10−16 [28] at BNM-SYRTE. During
the experiments in Garching, only a veriﬁcation at the level of 10−15 has been
performed. Consequently we attribute a conservative FOM accuracy of 2 × 10−15
for these measurements.

To check for possible cycle slipping, the frequencies fceo and frep were addi-
tionally counted to verify consistency. The 486 nm dye laser and the blue part of

the frequency comb were spatially overlapped, optically ﬁltered around 486 nm,
and directed onto an avalanche photodiode to measure the beat frequency with
the neighboring mode of the frequency comb. The detected beat note was ﬁltered,
ampliﬁed and directed to three radio frequency counters (Hewlett Packard, mod-
els 53131A and 53132A) utilizing diﬀerent detection bandwidth and power level.
All counters were referenced to the Cs clock. To check for errors in the counting
process only data points were accepted where all three counter readings were
consistent with each other. Additionally it was veriﬁed that the dye laser was
successfully locked to the ULE reference cavity during the measurement time.

Fig.7 shows a typical beat note measurement (left) and the corresponding
normalized Allan variance (right) of the dye laser locked to the reference cavity
relative to the fs frequency comb which was locked to FOM. As follows from the
Allan variance, the stability of the beat-note measurement is limited by the drift
of the ULE reference cavity for averaging times longer than 20 s. To compensate
for the slow ULE cavity drift we ﬁt a second-order polynomial to the measured
beat note before averaging which signiﬁcantly reduces the Allan variance for
longer averaging times. To accurately determine the frequency of the dye laser,
the drift-corrected results were averaged over 500 s interval.

We have measured the 1S-2S transition in atomic hydrogen during 10 days
in 1999 and during 12 days in 2003. Both data sets have been analyzed using the
same theoretical line shape model and are therefore completely comparable. In
Fig.8, the results of the extrapolation to zero excitation light intensity and the
respective error bars for each day are represented. The scatter between the day
data is larger than the error bars of the separate days for both measurements.
We have tested several possible reasons for this additional scatter including an
intra-beam pressure shift, a background gas pressure shift, Stark eﬀects due to
the RF gas discharge, and DC Stark shift and have been able to exclude all
these eﬀects at least on a conservative level of 10-20 Hz. A possible origin of the

scatter about 100 Hz can be due to a ﬁrst order Doppler eﬀect arising from a vi-
olation of the axial symmetry of the enhancement cavity mode and the hydrogen
atomic beam. The scattering of the excitation light on intra-cavity diaphragms
can cause slight changes of the ﬁeld distribution and the corresponding ﬁrst or-
der Doppler eﬀect. It should average to zero over multiple adjustments of the
hydrogen spectrometer. As the scatter is the same for both the measurements,
we believe them to be equivalent. The main statistical and systematic uncer-
tainties of these measurements are collected in Table 1. The averaging of the
the 1999 and 2003 day data was performed without weighting them for the day

errors.1 For the both measurements the dominating error arises from day-to-day
scatter, while the pure statistical error is signiﬁcantly smaller. In fact, weighting
of the day data only slightly inﬂuences the results (on the level of σ/2).

Comparing both measurements we deduce a diﬀerence of νH,2003 − νH,1999
equal to (−29±57) Hz. As the data evaluation and search for possible systematic
sources is still in progress, we consider this result as preliminary. The diﬀerence
of −29±57 Hz in 44 months separating both measurements equals a relative drift
of νH against the 133Cs ground state hyperﬁne splitting of ∂/∂t(ln[νCs/νH]) =
(3.2 ± 6.4) × 10−15 per year.

4 Data analysis

The frequency of an optical transition can be written as

ν = const · Ry · Frel(α),

(4)

where Ry is the Rydberg energy and Frel(α) takes into account relativistic and
many-body eﬀects. Ry cancels in frequency comparisons, therefore the depen-
dence of Ry on α (Ry ∼ α2) and other fundamental constants is irrelevant. The
relativistic correction Frel depends on the transition in the system considered
and embodies additional dependency on α, while const is independent of any
fundamental constants.
The frequency

of the 5d106s 2S1/2(F = 0) ↔ 5d96s2 2D5/2(F ′ = 2, m′
F = 0) electric quadrupole
transition in 199Hg+ was precisely measured at NIST between years 2000 and
2002 [8]. Numerical calculations including relativistic and many-body eﬀects for
the dependency of Frel,Hg(α) for νHg on the ﬁne structure constant α yield [29]

considering he leading order of α in Frel,Hg(α). Thus, the frequency νHg incor-
porates the following dependency on fundamental constants (leading terms):

In the light hydrogen atom, the relativistic correction for νH nearly vanishes:

These equations are easily solved for ˙α/α and ˙x/x, yielding the relative drifts

In this sense, the evaluation is model-independent. In Figure 9, both equations
and the solution are shown. Obviously, testing the stability of α by monitoring
only one transition frequency during a time period would require additional
assumptions of the drift of other fundamental constants.

Combining the result of our measurement with [8] we have obtained precise
restriction for a possible drift of α at present only assuming the linear drift
during the last years.

From 1998 to 2003, the drift of the ratio of the ground state hyperﬁne fre-

5 Conclusion

In conclusion, we have determined limits for the drift of α, µCs/µB and µRb/µCs
from laboratory experiments without any assumptions of their conceivable cor-
relations. All these limits are consistent with zero drift. Table 2 represents some
of the most accurate recent measurements of drifts of the ﬁne structure constant
α in diﬀerent time epochs. From all these data only the investigations of quasar

absorption spectra measured with the Keck/HIRES spectrograph show a signif-
icant deviation between the values of α today and 10 Gyrs ago [4]. Considering
the Oklo data as well as results of laboratory measurements one can suppose
that the drift, if existent at all, is not linear and that α has reached an asymp-
totic value or is in the extremum of an oscillation. To make a deﬁnite conclusion
additional independent astrophysical data as well as a further increase of the
accuracy of laboratory methods are required.

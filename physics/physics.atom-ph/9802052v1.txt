Medium modiﬁcation of scattering properties in interacting Bose systems are considered by solving
the Bethe-Salpeter equation. An equation of state for the normal phase (generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck
formula) is given using the in-medium phase shifts to include two-particle correlations. Conclusions
are drawn for systems of bosonic atoms with repulsive interaction such as sodium 23Na and rubidium
87Rb. It is shown that the in-medium scattering length and the absolute value of the in-medium
scattering phase shift for low scattering energies increase with density.

I. INTRODUCTION

Since the recent observation of Bose-Einstein conden-
sation (BEC) in rubidium 87Rb [1], lithium 7Li [2] and
sodium 23Na [3] in atom traps at extremly low temper-
atures new interest has arisen in the investigations of
interacting Bose gases. For a comprehensive overview
about the current experimental and theoretical activities
see [4]. The eﬀect of ﬁnite size on the critical temper-
ature of an ideal Bose gas, which is conﬁned in a small
cube, was investigated in [8]. However, when perform-
ing experiments at higher densities, the question of the
treatment of interaction in a nonideal Bose gas becomes
essential.

In [9] the temperature dependence of the moment of
inertia of a dilute Bose gas in a harmonic trap and the
role of interaction is discussed. A common attempt to
include interaction is the approximation of a hard sphere
Bose gas which can be treated analytically [10]. There,
the interaction can be replaced by a pseudopotential con-
taining the free scattering length a0 as the only param-
eter. For the atoms relevant in the recent BEC exper-
iments, values for the scattering length are obtained in
the low density limit from measurements of the cross sec-
tion [11] or from evaluation of spectroscopic data [12,13].
However, the isolated two-particle scattering properties
should be modiﬁed in dense systems due to the medium
as shown below. This means that the scattering processes
in a dense medium cannot be interpreted in terms of the
free scattering length only.

The medium modiﬁcations of two-particle properties
result in diﬀerent macroscopic eﬀects. First, nonequilib-
rium processes are inﬂuenced. Usually, kinetic equations
are derived in RPA or Born approximation [5–7]. The
corresponding collision terms include ﬁnal state Bose en-
hancement. It was demonstrated [7], that approaching
the critical density of Bose condensation the scattering
rates are increased due to Bose enhancement. In addi-
tion, the inﬂuence of the medium can be included by a
meanﬁeld approximation in the framework of the quasi-

particle concept. Employing the Bogoliubov transfor-
mation, a quasiparticle approach was proposed by [5,6],
which is applicable also below the critical temperature.
However, additional eﬀects arise if we go beyond
a quasiparticle Born approximation as shown below.
These eﬀects are obtained by the solution of the Bethe-
Salpeter equation containing intermediate Bose enhance-
ment. They cause a modiﬁcation of the T -matrix or
the corresponding transition matrix elements which are
absent in Born approximation. This T -matrix leads to
medium dependend eﬀective scattering phase shifts and
cross sections which are an important ingredient for col-
lision integrals. In this paper we will not discuss kinetic
theory in more detail (see [18]).

Second, the thermodynamic quantities are modiﬁed
by medium dependend two-particle properties. As well-
known, nonideality eﬀects of thermodynamic quantities
can be expressed in terms of two-particle scattering phase
shifts. A relation between these phase shifts and the sec-
ond virial coeﬃcient can be established using the Beth-
Uhlenbeck formula [14]. It is possible to generalize the
treatment of the isolated two-particle problem to dense
quantum gases. This is achieved using the T -matrix with
intermediate Bose enhancement as we will show below.

Systematic attempts for the derivation of second virial
corrections for dense quantum gases are given using ther-
modynamic Green function technique for Fermi systems
[15,16] or Ursell-operator technique [17]. In this paper we
apply thermodynamic Green functions for Bose systems
and study the microscopic two-particle scattering prob-
lem in medium and the resulting equation of state. We
discuss the conclusions for two examples with repulsive
interaction, sodium 23Na and rubidium 87Rb, which play
a major role in the BEC experiments.

First, let us remind some deﬁnitions and results of the
scattering of two interacting particles in vacuum. The
free scattering length a0 is deﬁned in the limit of vanish-
ing relative momentum k

Let us consider an imperfect Bose gas with a0 ≪
where λ = ( 2π¯h

In
this case, a zero range pseudopotential can be employed
which is parametrized by the free scattering length a0
only. For densities below the critical density of the ideal
Bose-Einstein condensation nBEC = 2.612λ−3, a ﬁrst or-
der correction of the ideal Bose gas pressure pid can be
derived [10]

virial corrections in the normal phase.

II. GREEN FUNCTION APPROACH TO
IN-MEDIUM SCATTERING AND
THERMODYNAMICS

In a dense medium, the single-particle, two-particle,
etc., energies are modiﬁed compared to vacuum values.
For instance, quasiparticle energies and exchange pro-
cesses with the medium have to be included. A system-
atic quantum statistical approach can be given employing
thermodynamic Green functions. In the case of fermions,
the in-medium scattering problem was investigated in
[15,16]. We follow the method as outlined in [16] and
apply it for the case of bosons.
We start from the Dyson equation

ing states the phase shifts δ can be expressed as

cot δ(12, 12; E) =

a fermionic system we give a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck
formula for the total density in a bosonic system which
is only valid in the normal phase for temperatures above
the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation

ntot(µ, T ) = nfree(µ, T ) + 2ncorr(µ, T )

(14)

which contain the inﬂuence of the medium. These in-
medium scattering phase shifts are a direct generalization
of the standard deﬁnition of free phase shifts which are
included in the low density limit [16].

From the spectral function thermodynamic properties

Therefore, we consider the

the real part of the self energy (7) at the quasi-particle
energy. The quasi-particle spectral function is applied
to the self energy (7) and to the uncorrelated two-boson
Green function G0
2 (9) which enters the ladder T -matrix
(8). From this a spectral function can be obtained which
goes beyond the quasi-particle approximation. The so-
called extended quasi-particle approximation is obtained
by assuming that the imaginary part of the self energy is
small. The resulting spectral function can be represented
as a δ-function and an additional contribution due to cor-
related particles in form of a derivation of the principal
value [15,16]

lar to the classical equation of Beth and Uhlenbeck [14],
the total density splits into density contributions due to

for (nfree < nBEC), we can deﬁne a quantity B∗(µ, T ) =
2ncorr(µ, T )/(nfree(µ, T ))2 which represents the non-
ideality contribution in analogy to the virial expansion of
the total density (4). We remark that B∗ contains non-
ideality contributions due to two-particle interaction and
degeneracy in any order of density, but no three-particle
interaction contributions. While the second virial coeﬃ-
cient Bn(T ) per deﬁnitionem contributes to second order
in density and depends on temperature only, B∗ also de-
pends on chemical potential and hence on density.
In
the low density and low temperature limit, or more ex-
act for a0 ≪
1, the non-ideality coeﬃ-
≪
cient B∗(µ, T ) coincides with the second virial coeﬃcient
Bn(T ) from eq. (4).

IV. MODEL CALCULATION

In the case of a separable representation of the interac-
tion, the Bethe-Salpeter equation (8) can be solved and
the T -matrix can be written in an analytic form. The
choice of a separable potential is motivated by the fact

that there is a rigorous method to replace an arbitrary
potential by a rank-N separable potential [19]. Sepa-
rable potentials are applied in the description of diﬀer-
ent physical systems, e.g., by Nozi`eres and Schmitt-Rink
[20] for electron-hole interaction or in nuclear physics for
the nucleon-nucleon interaction [21]. As shown below the
contact interaction which is widely used in atomic physics
is a special case of a separable potential.

For our model calculation we choose a rank-one sepa-

rable potential of the form

To apply the considerations above we focus on two sys-
tems which play an important role in the current discus-
sion on atomic Bose gases. For the ﬁrst one, sodium 23Na,
a free ground state scattering length of
25)aB (in
units of the Bohr radius aB) is obtained from cross sec-
tion measurement [11]. Spectroscopic data are in agree-
ment with 64 < a0/aB < 152 [12], i.e. repulsive interac-
tion is favoured and bound state formation is excluded.
For the second example, rubidium 87Rb, the ground state
5 nm is of the same order
triplet scattering length a0 ≈
as for sodium [1]. Spectra are analyzed to yield values
85 < a0/aB < 140 [13]. For our exploratory calculation
we have chosen a free scattering length a0 = 92 aB for
sodium and a0 = 95 aB for rubidium 87Rb to parametrize
the T -matrix (26).

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 1 shows the result for the in-medium scatter-
ing phase shift of sodium according to eq.(27). For
some densities the dependence on relative momentum
is plotted and compared to the free scattering phase
shift. The temperature T = 5µK has been chosen to
have similar values as reached in the recent experiments.
E.g., in the sodium experiment [3] densities exceeding
1014cm−3 have been produced and a condensate has
been observed at temperatures below 2 µK. The den-
sities in our calculation are below the critical density of
1014cm−3 at T = 5µK. In general, medium

modiﬁcations of the phase shift compared to the free
scattering phase shift become small (< 1%) for scatter-
ing energies ¯h2k2/m > (10...20)kBT . The inﬂuence of
the medium enlarges the absolut value of the phase shift
and leads to an extra minimum if one increases the den-
sity towards the critical value. Furthermore, we see that
the medium increases the derivative of the phase shift
at small momenta. This will result in an increase of the
scattering length as demonstrated in ﬁgure 2. Since the
free scattering length appears to be of the same size for
sodium and rubidium the major diﬀerence in the results
originates from the diﬀerent atomic mass. Consequently,
compared to sodium at the same temperature a similar
behaviour of scattering shift and length occurs for rubid-
ium at densities about seven to eight times higher.
Figure 2 shows that the scattering length according to
eq.(28) enlarges with increasing density due to the Bose
enhancement. We have plotted the density dependence
of the in-medium scattering length of sodium for two dif-

ing to our model calculation for sodium the value of the

For rubidium 87Rb at T = 5µK the scattering length is
1015cm−3). If
1014cm−3 (nBEC = 4.5
doubled at 8
one measures the cross section a clear enlargement of the
scattering length should be observed already at densities
about 5 times smaller than the critical density for Bose-
Einstein condensation.
In ﬁgure 3 we have evaluated the generalized Beth-
Uhlenbeck equation as given in eq.(25) and have com-
pared the non-ideality coeﬃcient B∗(µ, T ) of eq.(15) with
the classical second virial coeﬃcient Bn(T ) of eq.(4).
The relation of both is plotted for 23Na and 87Rb ver-
sus the free density of quasi-bosons at a ﬁxed temper-
ature T = 5µK. Approaching the critical density, the
non-ideality coeﬃcient B∗(µ, T ) increases strongly. The
mass diﬀerence causes the respective behaviour for rubid-
ium to occur at roughly seven times higher densities then
for sodium at this temperature. In the low density limit
B∗ approaches the second virial coeﬃcient Bn. Figure
3 shows a minor deviation especially for 87Rb from the
expected low density limit B∗/Bn = 1. It can be traced
λ nec-
back to the limited validity of the condition a0 ≪
essary to derive (3). The classical second virial coeﬃcient
Bn as the low-density limit is slightly overestimated for
higher temperatures and greater masses. We stress that
the absolute value of the non-ideality coeﬃcient B∗(µ, T )
is monotonically increasing with density.

We have also performed calculations with a separable
potential of ﬁnite range. The model parameter V0 and
β of the potential (16) have been ﬁtted to the free scat-
tering length a0 and the potential range r0. The latter
one characterizes the short range behaviour of the inter-

action. Since no exact datas are available, we have taken
a value in the order of the hard core radius of the atoms.
A theoretical value of the hard core radius is about 4aB
(from [23] at higher temperatures). The results with this
ﬁnite range interaction have been found to be not sen-
sitive if compared to the results presented in the ﬁgures
1-3 for zero range interaction. This is not very surprising
since r0 is much smaller than the free scattering length
a0. But we are cautious to state that the results are
in general independend of the potential range since we
know neither r0 nor a hard core radius at this very low
temperatures.

We remind that we restricted our calculations to the
normal phase.
Improving the ordinary quasiparticle
picture, correlations are included within the so-called
extended quasiparticle approximation.
In the Bose-
condensed phase the common approaches within Hartree-
Fock-Bogoliubov approximation (see [5,24]) should be
improved on the same level by including correlations be-
yond meanﬁeld.

Furthermore, our calculations are restricted to the case
of repulsive interacting bosons. The consideration of an
attractive interaction leads to the possibility of an ad-
ditional liquid-gas phase transition and possibly to the
formation of bound states. The question of a superposi-
tion of a gas-liquid or gas-solid phase transition and the
Bose-Einstein condensation in an attractive atomic Bose
gas like lithium 7Li is discussed in [25]. There, the equa-
tion of state is extended to the Bose-condensed region. In
the normal phase it is considered in the approximation of
eq.(3) which does not include in-medium scattering and
possible contributions from bound states. A treatment in
the framework of the generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck equa-
tion (14) would provide a better understanding of the
possible phase transitions.

In a generalization of the derived results to non-
equilibrium processes, transport coeﬃcients should be
modiﬁed not only due to ﬁnal state Bose enhancement
[6,7], but as well due to intrinsic medium eﬀects. The lad-
der T -matrix should serve as an ingredient for more ad-
vanced formulations of kinetic equations including strong
correlations [18].

In conclusion we suggest that in the recent experiments
with Bose gases, such as sodium and rubidium in atom
traps, density and temperature regions are within reach
where the scattering properties and the thermodynamic
properties are inﬂuenced by the medium. We expect that
the medium modiﬁcations have direct impact on the ex-
perimentally extracted values of the cross section and
hence the scattering length.

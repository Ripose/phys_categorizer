A magnetic ﬁeld dependent Feshbach resonance has been
observed in the elastic scattering collision rate between atoms
in the F = 2, M = −2 state of 85Rb. Changing the magnetic
ﬁeld by several Gauss caused the collision rate to vary by a
factor of 104, and the sign of the scattering length could be
reversed. The resonance peak is at 155.2(4) G and its width
is 11.6(5) G. From these results we extract much improved
values for the three quantities that characterize the interac-
tion potential: the van der Waals coeﬃcient C6, the singlet
scattering length aS, and the triplet scattering length aT .

Very low-temperature collision phenomena can be
quite sensitive to applied electromagnetic ﬁelds. Sev-
eral groups have altered inelastic collision rates in op-
tical traps by applying laser ﬁelds [1]. There have also
been numerous proposals [2–6] for using laser and static
electric or magnetic ﬁelds to inﬂuence the S-wave scat-
tering length (a), and equivalently, the elastic collision
cross sections (σ = 8πa2) between cold atoms. Particu-
larly notable is the prediction by Verhaar and co-workers
[2] that as a function of magnetic ﬁeld there should be
µK)
Feshbach resonances in collisions between cold (
alkali atoms. These resonances were predicted to cause
dramatic changes in the cross section, and to even al-
low the sign of the scattering length to be changed. Such
resonances are very interesting collision physics, but they
also oﬀer a means to manipulate Bose-Einstein conden-
sates (BEC), the properties of which are primarily de-
termined by the scattering length. Some time ago we
searched for such resonances in 133Cs and 87Rb, without
success [7,8]. This was not surprising because there was
enormous uncertainty as to the positions and widths of
the predicted resonances. However, recent photoassoci-
ation spectroscopy has greatly improved the knowledge
of the alkali interatomic interaction potentials, allowing
these resonance parameters to be predicted with much
less uncertainty [9]. As we show below, the fact that the
widths and positions of these resonances are so sensitive
to the interatomic potentials makes their measurement a
good way to determine these potentials.

The improved predictions for the resonance positions
facilitated their observation. In the past few months Fes-
hbach resonances have been observed in both 23Na [10]
and 85Rb [11]. In the sodium work, two magnetic ﬁeld
dependent processes were observed: 1) a change in the

expansion rate of BEC due to a change in the scattering
length, and 2) an enormous, and as yet unexplained, in-
crease in the loss rate. This loss rate precluded the study
of collisions in the interesting ﬁeld regime near the cen-
ter of the resonance where the scattering length changes
sign; the width of the resonance was not measured. In
the rubidium work [11] the resonance was detected as a
magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the photoassociation spec-
tra. The resulting resonance width was measured to be
far larger than originally predicted.

Here we report the study of a Feshbach resonance in
the elastic collision cross section between atoms in the
2 state of 85Rb. By changing the DC
F = 2, M =
magnetic ﬁeld we are able to change the collision rate by
4 orders of magnitude, and explore regions of positive,
negative, and essentially zero scattering length. We de-
termine the width and position of the resonance about a
factor of ten more precisely than in Ref. [11], and from
this data we improve the accuracy of the Rb interaction
In contrast to Ref. [10], we do
potential substantially.
not observe two or three body loss at resonance because
we work at much lower densities (109 atoms/cm3).

We measured the collision rates using the technique of
“cross dimensional mixing,” as in our earlier work [7].
In this technique, a nonisotropic distribution of energy
is created in a magnetically trapped cloud of atoms, and
the time for the cloud to reequilibrate by elastic collisions
is measured. The apparatus used is identical to that used
in our previous work on BEC in 87Rb [12]. It is a dou-
ble magneto-optic trap (MOT) system in which multiple
samples of atoms are trapped in a relatively high-pressure
chamber, and then transferred to a second MOT in a low-
pressure chamber. The second MOT is then turned oﬀ
and a “baseball coil” magnetic trap is turned on around
them. The atoms are then cooled by forced evaporation.
After the atoms are evaporatively cooled to the de-
sired temperature, the energy in the radial direction (and
correspondingly the square of the width of the trapped
cloud) is reduced to about 0.6 that of the axial direc-
tion. This is done by decreasing the frequency of the
RF “knife” used for the evaporative cooling more rapidly
than the cloud can equilibrate. The bias magnetic ﬁeld
is then adiabatically ramped to the selected value, and
the cloud is allowed to equilibrate for a ﬁxed time. The
shape of the cloud is then measured by absorptive imag-
ing. This is repeated for diﬀerent equilibration times,
and the aspect ratios of the cloud vs.
time are ﬁt to
an exponential to determine the equilibration time con-

1

stant τeq. As discussed in Ref. [13], τeq is proportional
to the inverse of the elastic collision rate [14]. From the
measured trap oscillation frequencies and the measured
shape and optical depth, we determine the temperature T
of the cloud. The magnetic ﬁeld
and average density
i
value at the center of the cloud is determined to
0.1 G
by ﬁnding the RF frequency that resonantly drives spin
ﬂip transitions for the atoms at that position and using
the Breit-Rabi equation. The spread in magnetic ﬁeld
across the cloud scales as T 1/2, and is 0.6 G FWHM for
a 0.5 µK cloud.

The measured equilibration times depend on B and
T and vary from 0.15 s to nearly 2000 s. To display
data taken at several values of both density and temper-
ature, we convert it to the normalized equilibration rate,
Γnorm = 1/
τeq. Figure 1 displays the data versus
i
mean magnetic ﬁeld. Γnorm has units of cross-section
and in fact is proportional to an empirical average over
the ﬁeld- and energy-dependent elastic scattering cross-
section σ(B, E). To calculate this average is problem-
atic — a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of particle tra-
jectories [15] is probably required. However in the low-
temperature limit it is clear that the maximum and min-
imum values of Γnorm will occur at the same magnetic
ﬁeld as the peak and zero of σ(B, E = 0). For a rough
qualitative comparison, in Fig. 1 we have also plotted the
theoretically predicted values of σ(B, E) for two temper-
atures. These predictions are calculated using the atomic
potentials determined from the observed maximum and
minimum values of the relaxation rate, as discussed be-
low. Both the cross section curves and the equilibration
data show the same qualitative features. For temper-
atures below a few µK, there is a slightly asymmetric
peak near 155 G, and the width and height of this peak
are strong functions of temperature. At 167 G there is
a profound drop in the rate. This dip is quite asymmet-
ric, but the shape is relatively insensitive to T , and at
the bottom (ﬁeld value Bmin) the rate is essentially zero.
The ﬁeld value of the peak (Bpeak) is customarily deﬁned
to be the position of the Feshbach resonance, and the res-
onance width, ∆ is the distance between Bpeak and Bmin
[11]. The scattering length is positive for ﬁeld values be-
tween Bpeak and Bmin, and is negative for ﬁeld values
below Bpeak or above Bmin. This dependence of the sign
is expected from previous theory. The observation that
Bpeak is at a lower ﬁeld than Bmin provides experimental
conﬁrmation that the scattering length is negative away
from the resonance.

Because the functional form of the normalized equili-
bration rate is not known, the desired quantities, Bpeak
and Bmin cannot be found by a detailed ﬁt to all of the
data. We determine them by ﬁtting a simple smooth
curve to only the few highest (or lowest) points at each
temperature below 5 µK, and assigning correspondingly
conservative error bars that more than span the values
determined for all temperatures [16]. We ﬁnd Bpeak =

155.2 (4) G and Bmin = 166.8 (3) G, giving a resonance
width ∆ = 11.6 (5) G. The values for Bpeak and ∆ are
reasonably consistent with the less precise values 164(7)
and 8.4 (3.7) G measured in Ref. [11].
In our experi-
ment, the accuracy of the peak position is much higher
primarily because of better ﬁeld calibration. The better
accuracy in the width is largely because the photoasso-
ciation measurement is a somewhat less direct way to
observe the resonance, and so substantial and somewhat
uncertain corrections are required to go from observed
signal widths to the actual resonance width.

We can now use these measured quantities to deter-
mine the singlet and triplet Born-Oppenheimer poten-
tials. The accuracy of predicted cold collision observables
hinges on the quality of these potentials used in the radial
Schr¨odinger equation for the nuclear motion. Accurate
determination of these potentials in turn relies primarily
on three parameters, the long range van der Waals coef-
ﬁcient C6 and the zero-energy singlet and triplet phases.
The phases are usually tabulated in terms of singlet aS
and triplet aT scattering lengths calculated with hyper-
ﬁne terms omitted from the radial equation.

The Feshbach resonance involves states with both sin-
glet and triplet character; consequently the present de-
termination of resonance width and position versus B
can be translated with the aid of theory into greatly
improved values for the singlet and triplet scattering
lengths. The old “nominal” values of the scattering
lengths and C6 (optimized to achieve agreement with
previous measurements) predicted the position of this
Feshbach resonance reasonably well, but, as in Ref. [11]
the predicted width was much smaller than observed.
This width reﬂects the coupling of bound and contin-
uum channels, and is primarily controlled by the diﬀer-
ence between the singlet and triplet scattering lengths.
It is inconvenient to tabulate results as a function of
singlet and triplet scattering lengths for 85 Rb, because
both are very close to lying on top of a divergent pole.
Accordingly, we present the results of our analysis in
terms of a dissociation phase νD as in Ref. [11]. We
deﬁne the corresponding singlet νDS or triplet νDT dis-
sociation phase in terms of the scattering length through
the relation [17]: νD = (1/π) cot−1(a/aref
1) where
aref = Γ(5/4)/[√8 Γ(3/4)](2mC6/¯h2)1/4 [18] and m is
the reduced mass of the atomic pair. The dissociation
phase is related to the short range quantum defect µsr
presented in Ref. [19] by νD ∼= µsr
1/4. The quantum
defect method developed in Ref. [19] was used to generate
the theory curves in Fig. 1.

We have adjusted the singlet and triplet Rb-Rb poten-
tial curves at small distances until the theoretical calcu-
lation agrees simultaneously with the present measure-
ments of Bpeak and ∆, to within the experimental un-
certainties. For a given C6, this severely constrains the
values of both νDS and νDT (see Fig. 2). However, the
position and width are not suﬃcient to totally constrain

2

all three parameters C6, νDS, and νDT. In order to ob-
tain values for all the parameters, we also require that
our triplet potentials predict the g-wave shape resonance
in an energy range consistent with the measured value
given in Ref. [20].

The results of this analysis are presented in Fig. 2. It
is immediately clear from the ﬁgure that accurate mea-
surement of Feshbach resonances are an extremely precise
method for determining threshold properties of the inter-
atomic potentials. In fact, our measurement has allowed
us to reduce the combined C6, νDS, and νDT parameter
space by roughly a factor of 80. As discussed in Ref. [11],
the position of the resonance depends mostly on C6 and
the sum νDS + νDT. The width depends mostly on the
νDT. As Fig. 2 shows, the allowed νDS,
diﬀerence νDS
νDT parameter region is an extremely correlated function
of C6. In particular, we ﬁnd that the nominal value of
the sum and diﬀerence coordinates are linear functions of
C6 and the uncertainties in the coordinates are constant.
Accordingly, we can represent the allowed parameter re-
gion in the following manner:
νDS + νDT = -0.0442 + 2.2(10−4)(C6 - ¯C6)
0.0005 and
νDT = 0.0666 - 6.2(10−5)(C6 - ¯C6)
νDS
0.003 where
¯C6 = 4700. Converting the dissociation phases into scat-
tering lengths, we ﬁnd reasonable agreement with previ-
ous work [21–23]. We ﬁnd for the nominal C6 the val-

0.4, and as(87Rb)=92.7
at(87Rb)=109.3
0.4. Our value
for C6, 4700(50) a.u. is slightly higher (and with smaller
uncertainty) than a previous analysis based solely on
the g-wave shape resonance [20]. We have conﬁrmed
that several scattering observables predicted by the new
Born-Oppenheimer potentials are consistent with previ-
ous measurements. Speciﬁcally, the new potentials pre-
dict a broad d-wave shape resonance [25] in 87Rb, the
scattering length ratio a2,1/a1,−1 [26] and the thermally-
averaged
inelastic rate constant [27] that
are consistent with previous measurements. We also ﬁnd
10 of the 12 measured d-wave bound states [22] within
the 2σ error bars [24]. The new potentials also permit
us to predict additional 85Rb Feshbach resonances [6], at
4.8 G with a width of 0.01G, and at
Bpeak= 226.5
4.0 G with a width of 2.2
Bpeak= 535.8
We have shown that precise measurements of the Fesh-
bach resonance in the elastic scattering cross section pro-
vide unprecedented knowledge of the Born-Oppenheimer
potentials that control Rb-Rb scattering processes at
sub-mK temperatures. We have also used this reso-
nance to enhance evaporative cooling of 85Rb in a low
density magnetic trap, and change the scattering length
from negative to positive. These capabilities should allow
novel studies of BEC in the future.

The small ﬁlled diamond is the range from this work. Note
that the rectangle and large diamond constraints were estab-

the position of the constrained regions depends linearly upon
C6, which is indicated by the small connected diamonds on

the eﬀect of 50 a.u. uncertainty in C6. The arrows indicate
sensitivity to changes in the resonance width and position in

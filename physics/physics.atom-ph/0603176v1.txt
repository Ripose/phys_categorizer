We report a ﬁrst measurement of the longitudinal relaxation time of 3He vapor in a mixture of
3He - 4He at a temperature below the 4He λ point in a deuterated tetraphenyl butadiene (dTPB)
coated acrylic cell. The 3He longitudinal relaxation time, T1, was measured using the Adiabatic
Fast Passage technique of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. We have obtained a 3He relaxation time
in excess of 3000 seconds at a temperature around 1.9 K. These results are important for a new
search on the neutron electric dipole moment, which aims at two orders of magnitude improvement
over the current limit. Such sensitivity is important to search for new physics beyond the Standard
Model.

Hyperpolarized 3He has found applications in diverse
ﬁelds such as in the study of quantum phenomena in low
temperature ﬂuids [1] and in the search for violations of
fundamental symmetries [2, 3, 4]. They are also routinely
used as polarized neutron spin-ﬁlters [5], as eﬀective po-
larized neutron targets for nuclear and particle physics
experiments [6, 7] and for low magnetic ﬁeld magnetic
resonance imaging [8]. All such applications have moti-
vated as well as beneﬁted from studies of the relaxation
mechanisms of polarized 3He in gas, liquid and super-
ﬂuid phases and under diﬀerent surface conditions. The
study of longitudinal relaxation of polarized 3He - 4He
mixtures at low temperatures is, however, of longstand-
ing interest in its own right [9]. The simple atomic struc-
ture of liquid 3He makes it an ideal system of correlated
fermions to model. On the other hand, knowledge of
the longitudinal relaxation of low concentration of po-
larized 3He in super-ﬂuid 4He, is of utmost importance
for a new search of the neutron Electric Dipole Moment
(nEDM) [4]. In the planned nEDM experiment, polar-
ized 3He dissolved in super-ﬂuid 4He will be exposed to
unique experimental conditions (described below).

The proposed search for the neutron EDM is a di-
rect search of the time reversal symmetry (T) viola-
tion. Therefore, it provides a unique way of searching
for charge conjugation and parity symmetry (CP) vio-
lation because of the CPT invariance. The Standard
Model (SM) prediction for the neutron EDM is below
the current experimental nEDM limit by six orders of
magnitude. However, many proposed models [10] of the
electroweak interaction which are extensions beyond the

SM predict much larger values of the neutron EDM. The
current understanding of the baryogenesis suggests that
other sources of CP violation might exist in nature be-
yond the Standard Model [11, 12]. Therefore, the new
nEDM search has the potential to provide severe con-
straints on models for New Physics beyond the SM.

The new nEDM experiment is based on the nuclear
magnetic resonance technique.
In this experiment, the
measurement of the nEDM comes from a measurement
of the diﬀerence in the precession frequencies of the neu-
trons as modiﬁed when a strong electric ﬁeld (50 KV/cm)
parallel to an external magnetic ﬁeld (B0) is turned on
(or reversed). Because the magnitude of the precession
frequency shift due to the interaction of the nEDM and
the electric ﬁeld is extremely small, the technique pro-
posed is to make a comparison measurement in which
the Ultra Cold Neutron (UCN) precession frequency is
compared to that of the 3He nucleus [4]. This technique
relies on the spin dependence of the nuclear absorption
cross section:

~n +3 ~He → p + t + 764 keV

(1)

The overall experimental strategy is to form a three-
component ﬂuid of polarized ultra-cold neutrons (UCN)
and polarized 3He atoms dissolved in a bath of super-ﬂuid
4He at ∼ 500 mK. The 3He concentration in 4He for the
proposed nEDM experiment is ∼ 1 : 1010. When placed
in a weak external magnetic ﬁeld (B0 =∼ 10 mGauss),
both the neutron and 3He magnetic dipoles will precess
in the plane perpendicular to the B0 ﬁeld. The neutron
absorption rate can be measured by monitoring the Ex-

treme Ultra-Violet (EUV) scintillation light generated in
super-ﬂuid 4He from the reaction products of Eqn. 1. The
polarized 3He nucleus thus acts as a co-magnetometer
because knowledge of the B0 ﬁeld environment of the
trapped neutrons is important in the analysis of the sys-
tematic errors of the experiment. The neutron storage
cell will be made of acrylic with deuterated tetraphenyl
butadiene (dTPB) coating on the inner wall. The dTPB
coating is chosen to minimize the UCN absorption on the
wall, which also acts as wavelength shifting material for
the EUV light. Therefore, understanding the relaxation
mechanism of polarized 3He and maintaining its polar-
ization at the unique nEDM experimental conditions is
essential.

While a number of experiments [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
have reported 3He longitudinal relaxation times in mix-
tures of 3He-4He at temperatures similar to our work,
the measurements most relevant to ours are by Lusher
et al. [16], and Himbert and Dupont-Roc [17] in which
3He atoms were in a gaseous phase. Lusher et al. [16] ob-
served that the presence of 4He generally caused 3He T1
to rise below temperatures where 4He ﬁlm was formed.
The relaxation times were observed much shorter at 14
gauss in [17] compared to those at 0.24 Tesla in [16] at
the same temperatures from the same sealed pyrex glass
cell. For the new nEDM experiment, the B0 ﬁeld will be
∼ 10 mGauss in magnitude and the measurement cell will
be made of dTPB coated acrylic which has never been
studied before. Therefore, as a ﬁrst step it is important
to study the 3He relaxation behavior in a diluted mixture
of 3He-4He in a dTPB coated acrylic cell below the 4He
λ point in a relatively weak magnetic ﬁeld. In this paper
we report the ﬁrst results of the 3He T1 in the presence
of 4He in a dTPB coated acrylic cell at a temperature of
1.9 K and at a magnetic ﬁeld of 21 Gauss.

We have adopted the spin-exchange optical pumping
(SEOP) technique for producing polarized 3He nuclei.
The polarization is measured using the nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) technique of adiabatic fast passage
(AFP). The schematic of the entire apparatus is shown
in Figure 1. It consists of a pair of Helmholtz coils with
a diameter of 68 inches and the typical magnetic holding
ﬁeld is 21 Gauss. A two-chamber apparatus for polariz-
ing the 3He nuclei and for measuring their relaxation time
at cryogenic temperatures was constructed from alumi-
nosilicate glass, and a cylindrical acrylic cell. The two
chambers are connected via a 3 mm diameter, 21-inch
long Pyrex capillary tubing and are separated by a glass
valve. The top chamber is a spherical cell with a diam-
eter of 2.0 inches, while the bottom chamber is a 2.0 in
diameter and 2.0 in long cylindrical acrylic cell attached
to the glass via a 0.5 in long and 3.0 mm diameter glass
to copper seal. The copper seal is attached to the acrylic
cylinder using the low temperature epoxy Emerson &
Cuming Stycast 1266. Each chamber can be indepen-
dently evacuated and ﬁlled with either 3He and nitrogen

2

gas 1 (top chamber) or 4He gas (bottom chamber), and
they can be isolated from the gas handling system via
a pair of glass valves. The temperature of the bottom
cell can be lowered to ∼ 1.8 K by pumping on the vapor
above the liquid helium inside the dewar. The temper-
ature was measured using a calibrated cernox resistance
thermometer.

Two NMR systems were built in order to measure the
3He relaxation time in both the top (pumping) cell and
the bottom cell. Each NMR setup consists of a pair of RF
coils, 12 in in diameter and one or two set(s) of pick-up
coils 2, 1.5 in in diameter. The RF and pick-up coils for
the low temperature (bottom) cell are placed inside the
dewar and hence are immersed in liquid helium during a
measurement cycle.

FIG. 1: A schematic of the experimental setup.

The top cell was prepared by baking it under vacuum
at ∼ 350◦ C, and then distilling a few milli-grams of Rb
into the cell (also under vacuum). Once the top cell was
ready a known amounts of 3He was introduced into the
cell for each measurement (the amount could be varied as
desired) and a small amount of N2 (∼ 50 - 100 torr ﬁlled
at room temperature) was also added as a buﬀer gas.
The top cell was enclosed in an oven and heated to 190
degree Celsius and a 30W circularly polarized laser light
at 794.7 nm was incident onto the cell to polarize the 3He
atoms through SEOP. While the 3He atoms in the top
cell were being polarized, liquid 4He was ﬁlled into the de-
war and the temperature of the bottom (acrylic) cell was
lowered below the liquid 4He boiling point by pumping
on the 4He vapor with a large throughput pump. Once

1 N2 gas is introduced for eﬃcient optical pumping which will
freeze on the wall of the capilliary tube at low temperatures.
2 Two sets of pickup coils were attached to the dTPB coated acrylic

cell as shown in Fig.1.

the acrylic cell had reached the desired temperature with
the lowest temperature being 1.8 K, a known amount of
4He gas was introduced into the acrylic cell. The laser
was then turned oﬀ and the top cell was cooled to the
room temperature. After which the glass valve separat-
ing the two chambers was opened to allow the polarized
3He atoms to diﬀuse to the bottom acrylic cell. The
valve was closed after 30 seconds and a series of NMR-
AFP measurements were performed with a time interval
between 50 to 220 seconds. The amount of 3He in the
capillary tube is negligible.

Measurements were carried out with a dTPB coated
acrylic cell. The longitudinal relaxation time (T1) of
3He was consistently shorter than 10 seconds with no
4He inside the cell at a temperature of around 1.9 K.
A strong correlation between the 3He T1 and and the
amount of 4He atoms introduced into the cell was ob-
served. Further, signiﬁcantly longer relaxation times in
excess of 3000 seconds have been observed. For compar-
ison, the 3He relaxation time at room temperature from
the optical pumping GE180 glass cell was between 5980
to 6700 seconds. Figure 2 shows the 3He longitudinal
relaxation times at 21 gauss holding ﬁeld from a dTPB
coated acrylic cell at ∼1.9 K. The amount of 4He was var-
ied from 0.0 to 1.076 mol while the amount of 3He was
ﬁxed at 0.0014 mol and 3He atoms were in vapor. 3 The
solid circles represents the data collected from a series
of consecutive measurements, while the open circles rep-
resent data which were collected following a one month
shut-down for the repair of our cryogenic system, dur-
ing which time the acrylic cell was stored in a nitrogen
environment. The T1 values for 3He were extracted by
ﬁtting the NMR data as a function of time to an ex-
ponential decay form with the AFP loss rate as a ﬁtting
parameter. The AFP loss rate obtained from ﬁtting these
measurements was 1 ± 1%, which dominates the system-
atic error in the determination of T1. The longest 3He
T1 we obtained at ∼ 1.9 K from the dTPB coated acrylic
cell was 3515 ± 61 ± 581 seconds, with the uncertainties
being the statistical and systematic, respectively. Typi-
cally, the main contributors to 3He depolarization are due
to dipole-dipole relaxation, magnetic ﬁeld gradient eﬀect
and the surface eﬀect at the wall. For the data shown
in Fig. 2 the dipole-dipole relaxation time was calculated
to be 7.38 × 105 seconds [18]. The relaxation time due
to the magnetic ﬁeld gradient in our system was stud-
ied carefully using a NIST GE180 sealed cell, which was
ﬁlled 4 with 100 torr of 3He, 50 torr of N2, and 534 torr
of 4He, at room temperature. The 3He relaxation time at
1.9 K due to magnetic gradient in our apparatus was de-

1.95 K.

termined to be 7.75 × 106 seconds. Therefore, the surface
eﬀect at the walls is the most important contribution to
the relaxation times in our measurements.

FIG. 2: The longitudinal relaxation time T1 of polarized 3He
as a function of the amount of 4He in the measurement cell at
a temperature of < 1.9 K>. The amount of 3He was held con-
stant at 0.0014 mol throughout all the measurements, while
the amount of 4He was varied between 0 to 1.076 mol. The
inner error bars are statistical while the outer error bars are
the quadrature sum of the statistical and systematic uncer-
tainties. The solid and dashed curves are ﬁts to the data with
the model described in the text.

The initial improvement observed in the 3He relaxation
time seen in Fig. 2 can be attributed to the formation
of the super-ﬂuid 4He ﬁlm on the dTPB coated acrylic
walls. This is likely due to the preferential adsorption
of 4He over 3He at the surface, similar to what has been
observed in [16] on a hydrogen coated pyrex glass sur-
face. The 4He atoms liquefy and collect at the bottom of
the cell, and the liquid level rises as the amount of 4He
is increased. Therefore, the contributions to the relax-
ation rates due to surface eﬀect and 3He diﬀusion are:
i) the depolarization due to the surfaces above the liq-
uid 4He (with the super-ﬂuid 4He ﬁlm coating), ii) de-
polarization at the liquid-gas interface and iii) diﬀusion
through the liquid 4He and the subsequent depolariza-
tion on the cell surfaces under the liquid. The relaxation
rates due to the walls of the cell above the liquid is given
V [19], where the constant ρwall is
by
the relaxation coeﬃcient, S is the surface area of the
walls and V is the volume occupied by the 3He atoms.
For a cylindrical cell of length L and radius R, when
ﬁlled with liquid 4He up to length l from the bottom of
the cell, the relaxation rate for the side and top walls is
1
R + 1
L−l ). Similarly the relaxation rate at
Twall

the liquid-gas interface is given by
L−l ,
where ρintr is the relaxation coeﬃcient for the liquid-gas
interface. The relaxation rate for the bottom of the cell

laxation rate for the bottom surface is

The relaxation coeﬃcient for the bottom surface ρbot can
be diﬀerent from that of the rest of the surfaces because
the dTPB coating procedure for the bottom surface was
diﬀerent from the other surfaces and the bottom had to
be glued on to the rest of the cell after the coating. De-
tails of the coating procedure can be found in [20]. The
two data sets shown in Fig. 2 were ﬁtted to the sum of
the three rates described above,

with ρwall, ρintr, ρbot and D as free parameters. In the
above formula, we neglected the relaxation rate from the
side surface inside the liquid. The best ﬁts were ob-
≈ 1
(i.e. the 3He atoms re-
tained when
lax almost instantaneously when they come in contact
with the bottom surface). Thus, improving the coating
procedure for the bottom piece of the cell will be im-
portant for the construction of the neutron EDM cell
for the planned experiment. The two curves shown in
Fig. 2, corresponding to the two data sets diﬀer only
in the wall relaxation coeﬃcient ρwall which was found
to be (3.33 ± 0.25)E-04 cm/sec for the solid points and
(2.0 ± 0.12)E-04 cm/sec for the open points. This reduc-
tion of the wall relaxation coeﬃcient could be related
to the exposure of the cell to a nitrogen atmosphere,
and needs to be further investigated. The relaxation
coeﬃcient for the liquid-gas interface was found to be
ρintr = (1.3 ± 0.6)E-12 cm/sec. The diﬀusion constant
D was found to be (1.56 ± 0.21)E-04 cm2/sec, which is
in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of
∼ 1.0E-04 cm2/sec [21].

We have studied T1 of 3He vapor from a dTPB coated
acrylic cell in a diluted mixture of 3He-4He at a temper-
ature of 1.9 K and extracted a wall relaxation coeﬃcient
of 2.0E-04 cm/sec for the ﬁrst time. We have obtained
a saturated T1 in excess of 3000 seconds independent of
the conditions of the cell bottom with a 3He number den-
sity of 3.9 × 10−5 mol/cc at a magnetic holding ﬁeld of
21 Gauss. Our data suggest that dTPB coated surfaces
may ﬁnd applications in other areas which employ polar-
ized 3He at low temperatures in addition to the nEDM
experiment. It is important to extend our current work
down to ∼ 500 mK and to a 3He concentration closer to
that of the nEDM experiment and such measurements
are currently being planned.

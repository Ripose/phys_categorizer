Abstract

We show that the highly excited rovibrational spectra of a diatomic

molecule and the closely related slow atomic collision processes contain more

systematics and require less parameters to characterize than the Rydberg

spectrum of an atom. In the case of a single channel, for example, we show

that a single short-range parameter gives a complete description of slow col-

lisions for practically all angular momenta, and covers an energy range of

hundreds of millikelvins. The same parameter also describes the highly ex-

cited rovibrational spectra in the threshold region, including states of diﬀerent

angular momenta. Sample applications and predictions of the theory are dis-

cussed, including comparisons with experiment.

This paper examines the properties of a two-atom system in a small energy region around

a dissociation threshold, with the region above corresponding to slow atomic collisions, and

the region below containing the highly excited rovibrational states of the corresponding

diatomic molecule. We discuss a type of systematics that relate states of diﬀerent relative

angular momenta, thus greatly simplifying our understanding of such systems. Comparison

of the theory with existing experimental data [1] also provides the ﬁrst veriﬁcation of the

breakdown of the large-quantum-number formulation of the correspondence principle [2–4].

With recent developments such as the analytic solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation

for 1/r6 and 1/r3 potentials [5,6,4], our understanding of two-atom systems is already con-

ceptually comparable to the quantum defect theory (QDT) of atomic Rydberg spectra [7].

Namely, the slow atomic scattering and the rovibrational spectrum of a particular angular

momentum can be understood in terms of the long range solutions and a parameter that is

a slowly varying function of energy in the threshold region [5,8,9,6,4]. In this work, we show

that a two-atom system possesses an even greater degree of systematics in the following

sense. Unlike the QDT for atomic Rydberg spectra in which diﬀerent angular momentum

states have diﬀerent quantum defects with no general relationships among them, a single

parameter is suﬃcient to characterize slow atomic collisions for practically all angular mo-

menta. The same parameter also characterizes the rovibrational spectra in the threshold

region, including states of diﬀerent angular momenta. In other words, in addition to the

relationship between the bound spectrum and scattering, as expected from traditional QDT

formulations, a two-atom system has also the unique property that scattering of diﬀerent

angular momenta are related, and so are the bound spectra of diﬀerent angular momenta.

While a similar idea can be implemented in a numerical fashion [1], it becomes a much more

powerful tool in the present formulation.

The origin of this systematics is not diﬃcult to understand and is due to a combination

of the following three properties of a typical molecular system.

(a) Atoms are strongly

repulsive at short distances. (b) Atoms are heavy compared to electrons. (c) The atom-

atom interaction at large distances behaves as 1/rn with n > 2.

2

The combination of the ﬁrst two properties gives rise to the well-known separation of

tightly bound rovibrational states into the product of two parts ψvψr, in which the vibra-

tional wave function ψv is, to the lowest order, independent of rotational quantum numbers.

For rovibrational states that are highly excited, the same properties ensure that the radial

wave function, up to a normalization constant, remain nearly independent of the angular

momentum until a distance is reached where the rotational energy term becomes compara-

ble to the electronic and other energy terms. This characteristic is uniquely molecular and

does not apply to the electronic wave functions of an atom, for which the rotational term

dominates the behavior at suﬃciently small r.

The implication of the third property can be understood from qualitative behaviors of

the eﬀective potential −Cn/rn + ¯h2l(l + 1)/(2µr2), in which the ﬁrst term represents the

long range interaction and the second term represents the centrifugal barrier. For n > 2 and

l 6= 0, this potential has a maximum and crosses zero at rx = [l(l + 1)]−1/(n−2) βn, where βn

is a length scale associated with the −Cn/rn interaction as deﬁned by

βn ≡ (2µCn/¯h2)1/(n−2) .

(1)

From a physical point of view, rx speciﬁes the location at which the rotational potential is

equal to the long range interaction. For an l that is not too large, rx is of the order of βn.

Since n is greater than two, for distances that are smaller than rx, the long range interaction

quickly dominates, and correspondingly, the importance of the angular momentum quickly

diminishes. Mathematically speaking, this means that for a potential that goes to zero

faster than 1/r2 at large distances, a pair of linearly independent solutions exist, which,

at relatively small distances, are not only independent of energy, but also independent of

angular momentum.

The combination of these characteristics leads to the following important conclusion.

With proper choice of long range solutions, a quantum defect theory for molecular rovibra-

tional states and slow atomic collisions can be formulated in which the short-range param-

eters are not only nearly independent of energy, but also nearly independent of the relative

3

angular momentum. This conclusion is very general and powerful. Its formulation and ap-

plication are illustrated here for a single channel problem with a van der Waals asymptotic

interaction. The formulation for attractive 1/r3 interaction and multichannel generalizations

will be presented elsewhere [10].

For a single channel with an asymptotic van der Waals interaction (−C6/r6), the proper

pair of long range solutions are ones with the behavior

for both positive and negative energies. This pair, which has not only energy-independent,

but also angular-momentum-independent behavior at small distances, is related to the f 0

and g0 pair deﬁned in [5] by a linear transformation. The fact that such a pair exist is a

result of the exponent n that characterizes the long range interaction, −Cn/rn, being greater

than 2.

With this choice of long range solutions, the single channel quantum defect theory is still

formally the same as discussed previously [8,6,4]. In particular, the bound spectrum of any

potential with the behavior of V (r) → −C6/r6 at large distances is still given rigorously by

the crossing points between a χ function and a short-range K matrix [8,4]:

χc
l (ǫs) = K c(ǫ, l) .

Here ǫs is a scaled bound state energy deﬁned by

ǫs =

ǫ

(¯h2/2µ)(1/β6)2

.

(4)

(5)

The χc function, corresponding to the choice of long range solutions as speciﬁed by Eqs. (2)

and (3), is given by

χc

l (ǫs) =

(Yǫl/Xǫl) + tan(πν/2)(1 + Mǫl)/(1 − Mǫl)
1 − (Yǫl/Xǫl) tan(πν/2)(1 + Mǫl)/(1 − Mǫl)

,

(6)

in which Mǫl = Gǫl(−ν)/Gǫl(ν), with ν and Gǫl being deﬁned in [5]. Plots of χc

l functions

for diﬀerent l are shown in Figure 1. K c is the short range K matrix that results from the

matching of the short range solution and the long range solution. It is given speciﬁcally by

K c(ǫ, l) =   f c

(7)

evaluated at any radius beyond r0 at which the potential has become well represented by

−Cn/rn.

Above the threshold, the scattering K matrix is given by a similar expression as derived

previously [8,6,4]:

Kl ≡ tan δl = (K cZ c

gg − Z c

f g)(Z c

f f − K cZ c

gf )−1 ,

(8)

with the Z c matrix being related to the Z matrix deﬁned in [5] by a linear transformation.

The key diﬀerence between the present formulation and the previous one is the following.

With the choice of long range solution pair as speciﬁed by Eqs. (2) and (3), and the property

of the wave function discussed earlier, the parameter K c is, under the condition of βn ≫ r0

[8,6,4], not only independent of energy, but also independent of angular momentum l in

the threshold region [see Eq. (7)].

In other words, a single parameter, K c, can describe

scattering and bound states of diﬀerent angular momenta.

The determination of the parameter K c is, in principle, straightforward theoretically. It

can be done, for example, by solving the radial equation at a small energy (include zero

energy) and matching it to the proper long range solution. However, since our present

knowledge about both the short range interaction and the Cn coeﬃcients is still not suﬃ-

ciently accurate for many systems, we focus here on the direct experimental determination

of both the K c parameter and the Cn coeﬃcient.

In particular, we show that if the Cn

coeﬃcient that characterizes the dominant long range interaction is known accurately, the

parameter K c can be obtained from the measurement of a single binding energy (similar to

the determination of K 0

l discussed previously [8]). If binding energies of more than one state

are known, in addition to the prediction of the parameter K c, an accurate determination of

Cn can also be made, especially when the two states are closely spaced in energy.

In Table I, the ﬁrst column presents the experimental results [1] for states of 85Rb2

characterized by quantum numbers F1 = 3, F2 = 3, F = 6, l = 2, and T = 8 [11,12]. The

results in the column labeled by Theory II represents a simple calculation making use of

only a single experimental energy.

In this calculation, the energy of the level labeled by

vmax − v = 1 in Table I is ﬁrst scaled according to Eqs. (5) and (1) with µ = 77392.368 a.u.

and a value of C6 = 4426 a.u. from the theoretical calculation of Marinescu et al. [13]. The

parameter K c is determined by evaluating the χc

l=2 function at this scaled energy [8], which

yields a value of K c = 0.2841. The crossing points of this constant with χc

l=2(ǫs) give the

predictions of the other energy levels listed in this column (see Fig. 1). Note that this simple

calculation already yields excellent agreement with experiment and compares very favorably

with a much more complex numerical calculation [1] listed under Theory I in Table I. This

excellent agreement shows that the parameter K c is indeed, to a very good approximation,

a constant in the energy range covered by the experiment (∼ 10 GHz). This is further

conﬁrmed by the fact that enforcing K c to be constant leads to an even better agreement,

a procedure that demonstrates a new method for the experimental determination of the

leading Cn coeﬃcient from a minimum of only two binding energy measurements.

Keeping in mind that the C6 value used in the ﬁrst calculation is not necessarily the

true C6, it is allowed to vary in the following calculation. With more than one experimental

binding energy available, we vary C6 in such a way that the two χc’s evaluated at the two

diﬀerent scaled energies (they may also correspond to diﬀerent l.) are the same, in other

words, we force the parameter K c to be a constant. The reﬁned C6 is then given by the root

of the following equation

χc
l (ǫs1) − χc

l′(ǫs2) = 0 ,

(9)

where ǫs1 and ǫs2 are two experimental energies scaled according to Eqs. (5) and (1) for van

der Waals interactions. The reduced masses are known with great precision from atomic

masses so that the only unknown on the left hand side is the C6 coeﬃcient. This procedure,

when applied to the two d states labeled in Table I by vmax−v = 1 and 2, respectively, leads to

6

a revised C6 = 4533 a.u., which is in good agreement with C6 = 4550 ± 100 a.u., determined

by Boesten et al. [14]. This C6 value reﬁnes the energy scaling and leads to a revised value

of K c = 0.3106. The column in Table I labeled as Theory III gives the result of energy

levels predicted using this set of revised parameters, and an even better agreement with

experiment is achieved. This procedure demonstrates a new method for the determination

of the Cn coeﬃcient from two or more values of experimental binding energies. It requires

no knowledge of the short range interactions, nor does it require numerical solutions of the

Schr¨odinger equation. The closer in energy those two states are, the better this method

works.

As stated earlier, the parameter K c describes not only the rovibrational states of a

particular relative angular momentum, but also the other angular momentum states in the

threshold region (see Fig. 1). Table II gives the predictions of the bound spectra of 85Rb2

characterized by quantum numbers F1 = 3, F2 = 3, F = 6, l, T = F + l, with l = 0, 2, 4, 6,

respectively [11]. They are predicted using parameters C6 = 4533 a.u. and K c = 0.3106.

The fact that K c is nearly a constant in the threshold region has also the following

important implications. (a) It provides an experimental veriﬁcation of the breakdown of

the large-quantum-number formulation of the correspondence principle, as a semiclassical

theory would have predicted diﬀerent results for, e.g., the spacing between scaled energies

[4]. (b) Since 1 GHz corresponds to 47.99 mK, the fact that K c is independent of energy

over a range of 10 GHz below the threshold implies that the same constant K c can describe

collisions over hundreds of millikelvins above the threshold (for all l’s that are not too

large). (Similar conclusion can also be derived for Li [8,10]). All the energy and angular

momentum dependences in this energy range, including shape resonances, are determined by

the dominant long range interaction, in combination with the centrifugal barrier. And they

are described analytically by the solutions for the long range potentials [5,6,4]. This result,

along with the fact that for small energies, the scattering for large angular momentum

is nearly independent of the value of K c and is determined entirely by the long range

interaction, means also that the same parameter describes slow collisions for practically all

7

angular momenta. As one implication, a single short-range parameter (a few parameters in

the case of multichannels [10]) describes not only the ultracold region of energies, but also the

region of evaporative cooling and the region of laser cooling. In contrast, in the traditional

eﬀective range expansion, a single parameter, the scattering length, gives little more than

the cross section at zero energy. Figure 2 shows the partial scattering cross sections for s, d,

and g waves predicted by the same short range parameter K c = 0.3106 for two spin-polarized

85Rb atoms in state F1 = 3, MF 1 = 3, F2 = 3, and MF 2 = 3. Only a small energy range is

shown here to make for easy identiﬁcation of the narrow g wave shape resonance, observed

previously by Boesten et al. [14]. More data on the scattering cross sections, including those

for larger angular momenta and over a greater energy range, and the summation formulae for

summing over all angular momentum states will be presented elsewhere [10]. (c) Since the

hyperﬁne splitting is typically of the order of 1 GHz, it means that the frame-transformation

method for atom-atom scattering [12], when properly formulated with K c (or the K 0
l

[8,6])

being the short range parameter [10], should work well in a multichannel formulation that

includes hyperﬁne structures [12,9].

In conclusion, a theory of slow atomic collisions and molecular rovibrational states has

been formulated that takes full advantage of the intrinsic characteristics of a typical molec-

ular system. This formulation establishes a simple relationship between states of diﬀerent

relative angular momenta and greatly reduces the number of parameters required to describe

slow atomic collisions and highly excited molecular rovibrational spectra. Multichannel gen-

eralizations do not change the key concepts in any substantial way, and the theory can also

be implemented in exact numerical calculations. As far as parameterization is concerned,

the theory can be further extended to an even greater range of energies by, e.g., taking into

account the energy and angular momentum dependences induced by the correction terms

to the dominant long range interaction [15]. Finally, the good agreement between the the-

ory and experiment provides the ﬁrst experimental conﬁrmation of the breakdown of the

large-quantum-number formulation of the correspondence principle [2–4].

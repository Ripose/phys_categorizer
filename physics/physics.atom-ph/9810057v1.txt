INTEGRAL IDENTITIES AND BOUNDS FOR SCATTERING CALCULATIONS

IN THE DIRAC FORMALISM

Abstract

Integral identities that hold between “desired” and “comparison” solutions of the radial Dirac

equations for scattering precesses are considered. Applications of these identities are discussed,

particularly the determination of bounds to variational calculations of K-matrix elements.

Relativistic eﬀects in atomic scattering, and indeed in many quantum scattering processes,

can usually be treated as small corrections, and handled by perturbation theory with respect to

the non-relativistic (Schr¨odinger) results. However, for some processes, such as the scattering of

electrons by atoms and molecules, and for many nuclear scattering processes, it is often convenient

or even necessary to use the Dirac equation directly. This is because the relativistic kinematics and

spin eﬀects are then automatically “built in” (see, for example, ref. [1 - 3] and citations therein).

In addition to this, relativistic corrections to the dynamics (i.e. corrections to the static potential)

may need to be taken into account.

In the Dirac formalism, the description of the scattering of a fermion (such as an electron or

positron) by a target (such as a neutral atom) is often reducible to the solution of the radial Dirac

equations (¯h = c = 1)

where f (r) and g(r) are the usual reduced radial coeﬃcients of the “large” and “small” components

of the Dirac spinor for the incident fermion of mass m and energy E. The terms X(r) and Y (r)

include exchange eﬀects as may be applicable. We shall restrict our discussion to the class of

potentials V (r), and corresponding exchange terms X(r), Y (r), such that the solutions f (r), g(r)

satisfy the following boundary conditions:

Speciﬁcally, a suﬃcient condition is that the limit of r2V (r) be zero as r → ∞ and as r → 0. If the

potential V (r) is long-range, that is contains a Coulombic contribution, then the sine and cosine

functions in (4) and (5) would be replaced by the corresponding Coulomb functions.

The asymptotic forms (4) and (5) can be written in the equivalent form

where ηκ(k) are the scattering phase shifts, while

Aκ(k) = Cκ(k) cos ηκ(k) and Bκ(k) = Cκ(k) sin ηκ(k).

The asymptotic normalization constants Cκ(k) (or, equivalently, the constants Aκ(k), Bκ(k))

may be chosen to be anything that is convenient. Some common choices are Cκ(k) = 1, Cκ(k) =

sec ηκ(k), etc. The scattering cross sections or polarization parameters are then calculated from

the phase shifts ηκ(k) [1,2].

In non-relativistic (Schr¨odinger) scattering theory perturbative eﬀects can be taken into ac-

count by using the integral identity between a “given” and “comparison” solution ﬁrst obtained by

Hulth´en [4] and later elaborated by Kato [5] and others. This integral identity can also serve as the

basis for approximate variational solutions to the scattering equations [4-7], and for determining

bounds on approximate calculations of scattering parameters [8,9].

Evidently, analogous results can be written down in the Dirac formalism of scattering theory,

as we now proceed to discuss. Thus, suppose f (r), g(r) are solutions of a “trial” or “comparison”

problem, corresponding to X(r), Y (r) and the potential V (r), namely

with

and the symbol ∼ indicates that R has been taken to be suﬃciently large that the asymptotic forms

(6), (7), (11) and (12) apply (we can take R → ∞).

The integral identities (14) and (15) relate the phase shifts ηκ (or, more generally, functions
of these, such as the K-matrix elements, Kκ = tan ηκ, T -matrix elements, Tκ = eiηκ sin ηκ, etc.)

to the “comparison” phase shifts ηκ (or corresponding functions thereof). This is clear from the

explicit form of ∆ for given choice of asymptotic normalization, that is, choice of A and B or

alternatively C. For example if C = C = 1 then ∆ =

sin(ηκ − ηκ), or if A = A = 1, B =

tan ηκ = Kκ, B = tan ηκ = Kκ then ∆ =

(K κ − Kκ), etc.

The integral identities (14) or (15) can be used for various purposes, some of which we discuss

brieﬂy in what follows:

1. Formal results.

If we take V = 0, and the corresponding free incident wave solutions of Eqs. (9) and (10) for

f κ and gκ, then the identity (14) (with A = A = 1, B = tan ηκ = Kκ, B = 0) gives the well-known

integral expression for the K−matrix elements,

(17)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

This is often used for extracting the phase shifts from numerical solutions of Eqs. (1) and (2).

2. Perturbative calculations.

A not-infrequent situation is that the potential V can be written in the form V = V0 + V1,

where V0 is a dominant (and/or easily solvable) interaction term (such as the electrostatic potential

in atomic scattering), and V1 is a small “correction” term. Then, obviously, if V = V0, f and g are

known (or easily obtainable), while V − V = V1 can be handled perturbatively. Taking f = f and

g = g in lowest order on the right-hand-side of Eq. (15), one can use that equation to evaluate ηκ

in terms of ηκ plus a lowest order perturbative correction (which is given by the RHS of Eq. (15)

with f = f and g = g). In general the perturbation may be in V only, or in X and Y , or both (see,

for example, ref. [10]).

3. Variational approximations.

In some instances it may be useful or necessary to approximate the solutions of (1) and (2)

variationally. For example, one may wish to have analytic representations of the solutions (recall

that, with rare exceptions, Eqs. (1) and (2) are not analytically solvable). In such cases, one can use

a variational approach, in which the desired (unknown) solutions f (r), g(r) are approximated by

analytic trial forms f (r), g(r) that contain adjustable parameters αj (j = 1, ..., np). The identity

(15) can be used to choose these parameters αj in a variationally optimal way. We illustrate this on

the case X = Y = X = Y = 0, and normalization choice Cκ = Cκ = 1, in which case the identity

(15) can be written as

k
E + m

sin(ηκ − ηκ) = I[f , g] + R2[f, g, f , g],

in these integrals, and this shall be done in the rest of this paper.

From Eq. (18), if we neglect R2, it follows that

(k, αj), that is, it is

κ

only necessary to choose the trial functions f , g. This is evident from Eq. (19b), in which, as can

be seen, V does not appear explicitly. Of course, we want to choose the adjustable parameters αj
of f (r, αj ) and g(r, αj ) in such a way that η(App.)

(k, αj ) is as close to ηκ(k) as possible. In other

κ

words, we wish to minimize

with respect to αj. Since

the normalization A = 1, B = tan ηκ is used, etc.), are then substituted into Eq. (23) to yield the
optimal variational approximation, η(App.)

in mind and investigated, if necessary.)

4. Bounds on scattering parameters.

In approximate calculations of scattering parameters (phase shifts, K-matrix elements, etc.)

neither the sign nor the magnitude of the diﬀerence between the (unknown) exact and approximate

value is known. However, for the case X = X = Y = Y = 0, if we write V = V + δV, f = f + δf

and g = g + δg, where δV, δf, δg → 0, then (with the choice of asymptotic normalization C = 1)

Eq. (14) implies that

k
E + m

(ηκ − ηκ) = −

dr δV (f

+ g2),

(26)

Z

where we have kept only the ﬁrst order terms in inﬁnitesimal quantities, and so set sin(δη) = δη.

Equation (26) shows that if V → V from below, i.e.

if δV = V − V < 0, then ηκ > ηκ and

vice-versa (as happens also in Schr¨odinger theory). This property can be used to set up a scheme

in which approximate calculations of phase shifts approach the (unknown) exact values from above

(or below), provided that the trial solutions are so chosen that the corresponding trial potentials

approach the exact one from below (or above).

Although, as already stated, in general it is not possible to evaluate either the sign or the

magnitude of the remainder term R2, Eq. (22), it is possible, in some cases, to determine calculable

bounds B on R2 of the form

R2[f, g, f , g]
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
This, together with Eq. (18) (or its equivalent with other asymptotic normalizations), leads to upper

< B[V, f , g].

(27)

and lower bounds on the scattering parameters. We illustrate this on the potential scattering case

(X = Y = X = Y = 0), and the choice of asymptotic normalization A = A = 1, B = tan ηκ =

Kκ, B = tan ηκ = Kκ, whereupon Eq. (14) becomes

k
E + m

(K κ − Kκ) = I[f , g] + R2,

where I[f , g] is given in Eq. (19).

We write the remainder term, Eq. (22) in the form

R2 = R2L + R2S,

where

R2L =

with ∆V = V −V , F = f −f and G = g−g. Then, using the Schwartz inequality (s, t)2 ≤ (s, s)(t, t),

it follows from Eq. (29) that

|R2L| ≤ aF bf ,

|R2S| ≤ aGbg and so |R2| < aF bf + aGbg,

f , g, the expressions bf and bg of Eq. (32) are calculable (remember that V need not be known
explicitly, in light of the identities (20) and (21)).

It remains now to determine bounds on aF and aG (which are not calculable since F = f −f and

G = g −g are not known). One way that such bounds can be obtained is from the integral equations

for the radial Dirac functions (written here for the present choice of asymptotic normalization

Note that F κ(r), Gκ(r) are known functions, for given trial functions f κ and gκ, since Gab
are known. We stress that the explicit form of the trial potential U (r) need not be known in Eqs.

(42) and (43) because of the identities (20) and (21). Thus, only the trial functions f κ(r, αj) and

gκ(r, αj) need be speciﬁed.

From the deﬁnition (46) of gij, and that of the Green functions (36), it is clear that the conditions

(50) are, for given k (i.e. given energy of incidence), restrictions on the strength of the potential

V (r). That is, the potential must be suﬃciently weak for the inequalities (50) to be met. Note,

however, that since the Green functions contain the factor

, gij will generally decrease with

increasing k. This means that a given potential V (r) may be such that the inequalities (50) might

1
k

not hold when k is small (low-energy scattering) but will hold for higher values of k.

Replacing the expressions aF and aG by their bounds (48) and (49) in Eq. (31) then leads to

enter into the expressions for K (App.)

We stress that the bound B2 of Eq. (51) (with Eqs. (32), (48) and (49)) is expressible in

terms of V (r) and the trial functions f κ(r, αj ) and gκ(r, αj), hence it is ultimately a function of

the adjustable parameters, that is B2(αj). These parameters may be chosen in accordance with

the variational prescription (25), or such that the upper and lower bounds are as close as possible,

i.e. such that B2(αj) is a minimum. These two prescriptions are not the same but, for suﬃciently

ﬂexible trial functions, they will yield similar results. In practice, the prescription (25) is simpler to

implement. In either case B2 can be made as small as desirable (in the domain where the conditions

(50) hold), provided that f and g are suﬃciently ﬂexible.

To summarize, we have presented integral identities that hold between given and a comparison

(or “trial”) solutions for scattering calculations in the Dirac formalism. Various applications of these

integral identities have been discussed, including their use in approximate, variational solutions of

the scattering parameters (phase shifts or functions thereof).

In particular, we have used these

integral identities to establish rigorous and calculable bounds on the diﬀerence between the exact

and approximate K-matrix elements for a wide class of potentials. These bounds can be made as

tight as necessary, if suﬃciently ﬂexible trial functions are used.

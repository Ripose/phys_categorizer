Some ﬁrst principles that, we believe, could serve as foundation for quantum theory of extended
particles are formulated. It is also shown that in the point-like particles limit the non-relativistic
quantum mechanics can be restored. As an illustration the soliton model of hydrogen atom is
considered.

To begin with we formulate the ﬁrst principles for quantum theory of extended particles:

•

•

•

Following A. Einstein and L. de Broglie we describe the extended particles by the stable soliton-like solutions
to non-linear ﬁeld equations.

Along the line of D. Bohm’s thought we accept that the wave properties of particles have the origin in non-linear
resonance eﬀect.

We assume that the statistical properties of particles can be deduced in the point-like limit from an analog of
the wave function describing the quantum statistical ensemble of D. Blokhintsev.

To illustrate these principles we consider the simplest scalar ﬁeld model given by the Lagrangian in the Minkowski
space-time

L0 = ∂iφ∗∂jφηij

(mc/¯h)2φ∗φ + F (S), S = φ∗φ,

and the electric charge

D. Bohm in his book ”Causality and Chance in Modern Physics” (1957) discussed the following problem. Let
φ = φ0 + ξ(t, r) describes the perturbed soliton-like solution. D. Bohm put the following question: Does there exist
) represents oscillations with characteristic frequency
any nonlinear model for which the spatial asymptote of ξ(r

As is clear from the structure of the Lagrangian (1), at spatial inﬁnity the ﬁeld equation reduces to the linear
Klein-Gordon one

and therefore the principle of non-linear resonance by Bohm (5) holds only for solitons with the energy E = mc2. It
that the universality of the Planck-de Broglie relation (5) fails. To reinstate the universality of the relation (5) we
modify the model (1) including gravity:

The crucial point of the model is to choose the invariant I(gij ) with the asymptotic property

where m stands for the Schwarzschild mass of the soliton. It can be veriﬁed that the relation (8) holds if one chooses

Rijkl;nRijkl;n/432. Estimating Rijkl at large distance one ﬁnds I1 =
where I1 = RijklRijkl/48,
I2 = G2m2/(c4r8). Thus we conclude that the principle of wave-particle duality has the gravita-

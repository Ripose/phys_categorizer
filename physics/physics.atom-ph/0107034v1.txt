In order to load a 4

P2 atoms per seond from a MOT operating on

P1 atoms into the

78 % of the 3

D2 atoms return to the ground state in

approximately 3 ms either diretly in a quadrupole tran-

sition or via the 4

P1 state whih deays via the 657 nm

interombination line. These atoms are not sub jet to

1

3

trapping fores during this time and will move out of

the trap at an average speed of 1 m/s. Thus the illumi-

nated apture volume of the MOT has to be su(cid:30)iently

large (Ø = 1 m) to ompletely reapture them one they

returned to the ground state. The remaining 22 % are

transfered to the desired metastable 4

3

P2 state. These

0.1

atoms exhibit the Doppler-limited MOT temperature of

typially 1-2 mK, whih appears ideal as a starting point

for further ooling.

loss regime. This e(cid:27)et is learly observed in our experi-

ments. The above solutions are used to (cid:28)t the deay and

IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas. , 48, 618 (1999)

loading data shown in (cid:28)g. 2. The relevant time onstants

were 22.6 ms without repumping and 71.8 ms with re-

pumping. The parameter ξ turned out to be negligible
without repumping (ξ < 0.001) but takes the value ξ =

0.32 when repumping is applied. The expliit expression

for the parameter ξ in (4) shows that a diminishment
of the linear loss rate Γ by a fator of 3.1 introdued
by the 671 nm repumper yields the same inrease in ξ
as an enlargement of the apture rate R by a fator of
(3.1)2
10. We an thus onlude that an order of mag-

≈

nitude inrease of the apture rate would yield a loss of

about 32 % of the atoms due to inelasti ollisions rather

than a transfer to the desired metastable state.

6 Conlusion

We have investigated the prodution of metastable al-

ium atoms in a magneto-optial trap operating on the

prinipal (cid:29)uoresene line. We obtain more than 1010

atoms in the 4

P2 state per seond at about 2 mK. An

3

order of magnitude improvement appears still possible

by improving the MOT apture rate, however at the

prie of entering the regime where inelasti light-indued

ollisions begin to seriously hamper the prodution of

metastables.

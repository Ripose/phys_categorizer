Abstract. We study the Josephson oscillations of two coupled elongated condensates. Linearized calcula-
tions show that the oscillating mode uniform over the length of the condensates (uniform Josephson mode)
is unstable : modes of non zero longitudinal momentum grow exponentially. In the limit of strong atom
interactions, we give scaling laws for the instability time constant and unstable wave vectors. Beyond the
linearized approach, numerical calculations show a damped recurrence behavior : the energy in the Joseph-
son mode presents damped oscillations. Finally, we derive conditions on the conﬁnement of the condensates
to prevent instabilities.

1 Introduction

Josephson oscillations arise between two Bose-Einstein condensates coupled by tunneling eﬀect. They have been ob-
served in superﬂuid Helium[1] and in superconductors[2] and have recently been achieved in dilute atomic BEC in a
double well potential[3]. The physics of two coupled condensates has been extensively studied in a two modes model,
where only two single particle modes are involved[4]. For atoms interacting in each well through a two-body inter-
action, diﬀerent regimes are reached depending on the ratio between the the tunneling strength to the mean ﬁeld
interaction energy of atoms in each well[5,4]. For small mean ﬁeld interaction, one expects to observe stable Rabi oscil-
lations. For large mean ﬁeld interaction one enters the Josephson regime. In this regime, oscillations around equilibrium
conﬁguration have a reduced amplitude in atom number and their frequency depends on the mean ﬁeld energy.

Atom chips[6] are probably good candidates to realize Josephson oscillations of Bose-Einstein Condensates as they
enable the realization of micro-traps with strong conﬁnement and ﬂexible geometries. A possible conﬁguration to
realize a tunnel coupling between BEC on an atom-chip is proposed in [7]. In this proposal, the two condensates are
very elongated and are coupled all along their longitudinal extension. With such an elongated geometry, both the Rabi
and the Josephson regime could be accessed. However, in this case, tunnel coupling may be larger than the longitudinal
frequency and the two modes model a priori breaks down. In this paper, we are interested in the stability of the uniform
Josephson mode where all the atoms oscillate between the two wells independently on their longitudinal position. In
the absence of interaction between atoms and if the transverse and longitudinal trapping potentials are separable,
the longitudinal and transverse degree of freedom are decoupled and one expects to observe stable Rabi oscillations
between the condensates. On the other hand interactions between atoms introduce non linearities that may couple the
two motions. For a homogeneous situation as atoms trapped in a box-like potential, uniform Josephson oscillations
are a solution of the mean ﬁeld evolution equations and are a priori possible, even in presence of interactions between
atoms. However, the non linearities introduced by interactions between atoms may cause instability of this uniform
Josephson mode. Similar modulational instabilities appear in many situations of nonlinear physics such as water waves
propagation[8] or light propagation in a non linear ﬁber[9]. In the context of Bose Einstein condensates, they have been
observed in presence of a periodic potential, at positions in the Brillouin zone where the eﬀective mass is negative[10,
11,12]. In our case a modulational instability would cause uniform Josephson oscillations to decay into modes of non
vanishing longitudinal momentum. The goal of this paper is to investigate those instabilities.

We assume that all the relevant frequencies (interaction energy and tunnel coupling) are much smaller than the
transverse oscillation frequencies in each well so that we can consider only a one dimensional problem. Thus, the

We are interested in the stability of uniform Josephson oscillations around the equilibrium conﬁguration where the
two condensates have the same phase and equal longitudinal density. In the sections 2-4, we consider a homogeneous
conﬁguration where U (z) = 0. In the sections 2 and 3, we calculate the linearized evolution of modes of non zero
longitudinal momentum in the presence of uniform Josephson oscillations. In the section 2, we give results of a
calculation valid both in the Josephson and in the Rabi regime. In section 3, we show that, in the Josephson regime,
the system is well described by a modiﬁed Sine-Gordon equation. For small amplitude oscillations, we derive scaling
laws for the instability time constant and the wave vectors of the growing modes. In section 4, we go beyond the previous
linearized approaches and present numerical results. We observe damped oscillations of the uniform Josephson mode
amplitude. Such oscillations are similar to the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam recurrence behavior[14,15]. In the last section (5), we
present numerical calculations in the case of a harmonic longitudinal conﬁnement. We show that Josephson oscillations
are stable for a suﬃciently strong conﬁnement and we give an approximate condition of stability.

2 Numerical linearized calculation

To investigate whether Josephson oscillations are unstable with respect to longitudinal excitations, we use a linearized
calculation around the time-dependent solution corresponding to uniform Josephson oscillations. Such oscillations are
described by the z-independent mean ﬁelds ϕ1 and ϕ2 describing the two condensates which obey the time dependent

3 Calculation in the Josephson limit

In the Josephson regime, where γ
ρ0g, the amplitude of oscillations in the relative density δρ remains small compared
to the mean density and one can assume ρ1 = ρ2 in the Josephson energy term of the Hamiltonian. Furthermore,
we restrict ourselves to long wavelength excitations described by phonons and we neglect anharmonicity of phonons.
Then, the Hamiltonian reduces to

been extensively studied[17]. In particular, it has been shown that, for a Sine-Gordon Hamiltonian, oscillations of

the Sine-Gordon Hamiltonian because of the presence of Hc. In the following, we derive results about stability of our
modiﬁed Sine-Gordon system. As we will see later, we recover results close to that obtained for the Sine-Gordon model.

To investigate whether some non vanishing k modes are unstable in presence of a Josephson oscillation, we linearize, as
in the previous section, the equation of motion derived from Eq.6 around the solution ρosc, θosc. Because of translational
invariance, we can study independently the evolution of modes of well deﬁned longitudinal wave vector k. Writing

We solved numerically Eq.10 and Eq.12 and we ﬁnd that modes of low k wave vectors are unstable. Fig.4 gives the
instability rate and the maximum k wave vector of unstable modes. Those results agree within 10% to the more general
results of the previous section as long as γ < 0.2 and Θosc < 0.6.

To get more insight into the physics involved and to obtain scaling laws for the instability rate and the instability
range in k, we will perform several approximations. The evolution matrix M of Eq.12 is periodic in time with a period
ωJ . We can thus use a Floquet analysis[18] and look for solutions of Eq.12 in the form

Thus, solutions of Eq.12 are found as eigenvalues of the linear set of equations (14). The mode is unstable if there
exists an eigenvalue of non vanishing real part and its growth rate is the real part of the eigenvalue.

where fa = (2ρ0g/(k2/2 + 2γ))(1/4) and fs = (4ρ0g/k2)(1/4).

We numerically diagonalise this matrix and ﬁnd the unstability rate as the largest real part of the eigenvalues. For
a given oscillation amplitude Θosc, we ﬁnd the most unstable k component giving the largest instability rate. Fig.4
shows this instability rate as a function of Θosc for diﬀerent ratios γ/ρ0g. We ﬁnd a very good agreement with the
values obtained by integration of Eq.12 in the range θ < 0.6 and Γ/(ρ0g) < 0.1.

If we restrict ourselves to terms linear in Θosc, then the only eﬀect of the Josephson oscillations is to introduce a
coupling between the symmetric and antisymmetric mode. We checked that this coupling alone does not introduce any
instability. Thus instability is due to the quadratic terms. Those terms contain a modulation at 2ωJ . This modulation
corresponds to the modulation of the frequency of the antisymmetric mode

4 Beyond the linearisation

The two previous sections give a linearized analysis of the evolution of perturbations. They show that the presence
of uniform Josephson oscillations produces instabilities of modes of non vanishing momentum. The energy in these
mode grows and consequently, the energy of the uniform Josephson mode decreases and one expects a decrease of the
uniform Josephson oscillations amplitude. Such a decrease is beyond the previous linearized analysis and we perform
full numerical calculation of the evolution of the mean ﬁelds ψ1(z, t) and ψ2(z, t). The evolution equations derived

corresponding to a temperature kBT = ρ0g/10. We observe that the amplitude of the Uniform Josephson Oscillations
presents damped oscillations. For γ
ρ0g, the period of these amplitude oscillations is about three times the inverse
of the instability rate of Eq.18. The ratio between the Josephson frequency and the frequency of these amplitude
oscillations is about 20 and is almost independent on the ratio between γ and ρ0g as long as γ < ρ0g. For larger γ,
this ratio increases and more Josephson oscillations are seen in a period of the amplitude modulation. Such amplitude
oscillations are a reminiscence of the Fermi-Ulam-Pasta recurrence behavior observed in many non linear systems with
modulational instabilities[17,14,15]. In particular, this recurrence behavior has been seen in numerical evolution of the
Sine-Gordon Hamiltonian[19]. In our case, we observe an additional damping which results probably from the coupling
to symmetric modes.

The case of an initial amplitude Θosc = π/2 is of particular interest as, in absence of interactions between atoms,
it corresponds to Rabi oscillations of maximum amplitude. Fig.7 gives the evolution of N1 for γ = ρ0g and an initial
amplitude Θosc = π/2.

5 Case of a conﬁned system

In the previous sections, we considered large and homogeneous systems. We found that unstable excited modes are
ρ0g, we derived the scaling law Eq.19 for the maximum
those of low wave vectors. In the Josephson limit where γ

the minimum wave vector of excited modes is larger than the maximum unstable k value Eq.19 and the system is stable.
This condition can be understood in a diﬀerent way : the energy of the lowest longitudinal mode is ~2π√ρ0g/(mL) (
~/√mρ0g). Thus, we ﬁnd that the system is stable provided that the energy of the lowest excited

An approximate condition of stability of Josephson oscillations in the case of a cloud trapped in a harmonic
longitudinal potential of frequency ω is found as follows. The size of cloud, described by a Thomas Fermi proﬁle, is
L = 2µ/(mω2), where µ = ρ0g is the chemical potential and ρ0 the peak linear density. Then, from the same argument

as above, one expects to observe stable oscillations for

where α is a numerical factor close to one. We performed numerical simulations of the evolution in the case of a
harmonic potential, adding to both left hand sides of Eqs.20 a trapping potential 1/2mω2z2. The initial situation
is the Thomas Fermi proﬁle superposed on thermal random ﬂuctuations and a global phase diﬀerence between the
condensates Θosc = π/2. The tunnel coupling is γ = ρ0g. The resulting Josephson oscillations are shown in Fig.8
for ω = ρ0g/~ and ω = 0.1ρ0g/~. We observe that for ω = ρ0g/~, Josephson oscillations are stable whereas, for
ω = 0.1ρ0g/~, oscillations are unstable.

6 Conclusion and prospects

We have shown that Josephson oscillations of two coupled elongated condensates are unstable with respect to ex-
citations of longitudinal modes. The unstable modes are those of small wave vectors. In the Josephson limit where

ρ0g, we have derived the scaling lows Eq.18 and Eq.19 for the instability time constant and wave vectors. Since the
γ
frequency of Josephson oscillations are 2√γρ0g, the ﬁrst equation tells us that the number of oscillations that can be
observed scales as θ2
osc and is independent on γ/ρ0g. This is true as long as γ < ρ0g. For larger γ/(ρ0g), the Josephson
condition is not fulﬁlled. Eﬀect of interactions is less pronounced and more oscillations can be observed. Performing
numerical calculations beyond the linearized approach, we have shown that the system presents a recurrence behavior,
although it is damped quickly. Finally, we investigated the stability of oscillations in ﬁnite size systems. Eq.21 gives
the maximum longitudinal size of conﬁned condensate that enables the presence of stable Josephson oscillations. We
also considered the case of harmonically trapped cloud and give an approximate condition on the oscillation frequency
to have stable Josephson oscillations.

Among the possible extensions of this work, two questions are of immediate experimental interest. First, the
eﬀect of a random longitudinal potential could be investigated. Indeed, it has been proposed to realized elongated
coupled condensates using magnetic trapped forms by micro-fabricated wires[7], but, for such systems, a roughness
of the longitudinal potential has been observed[20,21,22]. If the amplitude of the roughness potential is smaller than
the chemical potential of the condensate, one expects to still have a two single elongated condensate. However, the
roughness of the potential may change signiﬁcantly the results of this paper.

Second, the eﬀect of correlations between atoms may be studied. Indeed, for large interactions between atoms,
correlations between atoms become important. More precisely, for ρ0 < mg/~2, a mean ﬁeld approach is wrong and
the gas is close to the Tonks-Girardeau regime[23,24,25]. Such a situation is not described in this paper in which a
mean ﬁeld approach has been assumed. Thus, a new study should be devoted to the physics of coupled elongated
Tonks gas.

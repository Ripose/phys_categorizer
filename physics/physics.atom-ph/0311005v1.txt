A new concise method is presented for the calculation of the ground-state
energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and matter ﬁeld interacting system. With
the assumption of squeezed-like state, a new vacuum state is obtained for the
interacting system. The energy of the new vacuum state is lower than that given
by the second-order perturbation theory in existing theories. In our theory, the
Casimir eﬀect is attributed neither to the quantum ﬂuctuation in the zero-point
energy of the genuine electromagnetic ﬁeld nor to that in the zero-point energy
of the genuine matter ﬁeld, but to that in the vacuum state of the interacting
system. Both electromagnetic ﬁeld and matter ﬁeld are responsible for the
Casimir eﬀect.

The phenomenon that an attractive force exists between two uncharged
conducting metal plates is called the Casimir eﬀect because of the celebrated
formula that Casimir derived for the force between the two plates.[?] Casimir
calculated the sum of the zero-point energies of the normal modes of the elec-
tromagnetic (EM) ﬁelds and showed that the sum and the Casimir force, as the
spatial derivative of the total energy, depend on the distance between the two
plates.[?] Later, Lifshitz[?] and van Kampen et al.[?] made the generalization of
Casimir eﬀect to the case of two dielectric plates.

The origin of the Casimir eﬀect has usually been attributed to the quan-
tum ﬂuctuations in the EM zero-point energy due to the presence of the two
plates. However, Schwinger and his cooperators[?, ?] proposed the Schwinger’s
source theory of the Casimir eﬀect and showed that the Casimir force can be
derived with no explicit reference to the zero-point energy ﬂuctuations of the

EM ﬁeld. Milonno and Shih[?] developed a new source theory within the frame-
work of completely conventional quantum electrodynamics. In this theory, the
Casimir force can be derived in terms of the quantum ﬂuctuations of atomic
dipoles in the dielectric where the EM ﬁeld mediates the EM interactions be-
tween those dipoles. Recently, Koashi and Ueda[?] published the matter-ﬁeld
theory of Casimir force in which the matter and EM ﬁeld can be treated on an
equal footing. Their strategy is to explicitly diagonalize the matter-ﬁeld Hamil-
tonian, which is quadratic in its dynamic variables. The result shows that both
EM ﬁeld and matter ﬁeld contributes to the zero-point energy and therefore to
the Casimir force.

So it is unclear up to now what the physical interpretation of the Casimir
eﬀect is. It seems like it is largely a matter of taste whether we attribute the
Casimir force to the quantum nature of the EM ﬁeld or to that of the matter
ﬁeld.[?, ?] However, according to the postulates of quantum mechanics, to any
well-deﬁned observable (or dynamical variable) in physics, there corresponds
an operator such that measurement of the observable yields values which are
eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. Therefore, any physical eﬀect should
have unambiguous interpretations. On the other hand, the interpretation of the
physical eﬀect should reﬂect the physical reality.

In this letter, we will treat the EM ﬁeld and the matter collective modes
(plasmons in dielectric plates) on the same basis as in Ref. [?]. A new concise
method will be presented for the calculation of the ground-state energy of the
EM ﬁeld-matter interacting system. A qualitative interpretation of the Casimir
eﬀect will be given based on the new vacuum state obtained in this letter. In
our theory, the Casimir eﬀect is attributed neither to the quantum ﬂuctuations
in zero-point energy of the genuine EM ﬁeld nor to that in zero-point energy
of the genuine matter ﬁeld, but to that in zero-point energy of the combined
vacuum state of the EM ﬁeld and the matter ﬁeld.

We now consider the interacting system of EM ﬁeld and the matter ﬁeld.
In quantum mechanics, the EM ﬁeld can be described as a set of harmonic os-
cillators corresponding to the normal mode frequencies, which are determined
from the Maxwell equations with proper boundary conditions. The so-called
matter ﬁeld represents the collective motions of various kinds of charged par-
ticles in the dielectric substance.[?] They are surface mode plasmons that can
also be described as a set of harmonic oscillators. Considering the interactions
between these two sets of harmonic oscillators, the Hamiltonian of the system
is as follows:

H = H0 + HI ,

In general, the ground-state energy of the system can be obtained by directly
diagonalizing the Hamiltonian.[?] However, in order to obtain analytic results
so as to have an explicit interpretation of the Casimir eﬀect, without losing
generality, we consider the interacting system with single mode of EM ﬁeld and
single mode matter ﬁeld.
In this case, we have the following simple form of

From the Hamiltonian, Eq. (4), we know that the two subsystems are cou-
pled linearly with each other and the numbers of photons (of the EM ﬁeld) and
plasmons (of the matter ﬁeld) are not conservative respectively. Therefore it is
appropriate to write the ground-state wave function for the interacting system
in the form of squeezed-like state as follows:[?, ?, ?, ?]

|gi = A exp

where |0, 0i is the unperturbed vacuum state of the EM and matter ﬁelds with
the property a |0, 0i = b |0, 0i = 0 and α, β and γ are the parameters to be
determined in the following calculation. A is a constant for the normalization
of the state |gi according to the relation hg |gi = 1. With the aid of closure
relations of coherent states of a and b, we have

where φ and ϕ are respectively eigenvalues of a and b, corresponding to their

satisﬁes the following relations

from which the parameters α, β and γ and therefore the vacuum state |gi and
the corresponding energy E can be determined.

Putting Eq. (5) into Schr¨odinger equation (8) and using Eqs. (6) and (7),

In the above equation, we have put those terms, such as, |gi, a+a+ |gi, b+b+ |gi
and a+b+ |gi together. In order to get a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation,
we may let the coeﬃcients of those terms equal zero respectively.[?, ?, ?] Then
we have

In this case we can get a solution with above conditions although we could
not assert that it is a unique one. We know that |gi, a+a+ |gi, b+b+ |gi and
a+b+ |gi are not orthogonal to each other but they are linearly independent. All
the states with (a+)m(b+)n |gi build a complete base of Hilbert space. Therefore
the solution of Eqs. (10)-(13) should be a state of the system. In addition, we
will see below that the state energy is lower than that of the ordinary vacuum
state. This fact means that the new state could be regarded as the physical
vacuum state of the given system.

From Eqs. (10)-(12) we can get the relations among the parameters α, β
and γ and the state energy E. Considering the following conﬁning conditions
derived from the normalization of the state |gi

|α| < 1/2,

|β| < 1/2,

|γ| < 1,

(14)

we obtain the following unique possible energy value for the ground state from
equation (13):

which is obviously lower than the unperturbed vacuum state, i.e., E < E0 =
(¯hωa + ¯hωb)/2.

For the weak interaction, i.e., |v+|, |v−| << ¯hωa, and ¯hωb , we have

to the fourth order of |v±|/¯hωa,b. This result agrees exactly with that obtained
by Koashi and Ueda[?] to the second order of |v±|/¯hωa,b and it is lower than that
in Ref.[?] to the fourth order. At the same time, our theory applies not only
for the weak interacting system but also for the relatively strong interacting
system. We can get the analytic result for strong interacting system.

We now discuss the physical interpretation of the Casimir eﬀect. Up to now,
there are two quite diﬀerent kinds of physical interpretations of the Casimir
force, i.e., the ﬁeld-theory[?, ?] and the source theory.[?, ?, ?] In the ﬁeld-theory,
the Casimir force is attributable to the zero-point energy ﬂuctuations of the
genuine EM ﬁeld, where the existence of the conducting plates can only change
the boundary conditions of the EM ﬁeld. However, Schwinger et al [?, ?] got
the same formula of the Casimir force based on the source theory, and they
pointed out that the Casimir eﬀect is attributable to the quantum ﬂuctuations
of the genuine matter ﬁeld, where the EM ﬁeld is only the medium to trans-
port the electromagnetic interactions between atomic dipoles in the dielectric
substances.[?] However, if we choose appropriate ordering of operators in the
Hamiltonian of linearly coupled harmonic oscillators, the second-order correc-
tion to the ground-state energy can therefore be attributed solely to quantum
ﬂuctuations of either one of the oscillators, the EM ﬁeld operator or the matter
ﬁeld one.[?, ?] Then the Casimir force can be attributable either to the gen-
uine EM ﬁeld or to the genuine matter ﬁeld.[?] According to the theories of
Casimir,[?] Schwinger et al.[?, ?] and Koashi and Ueda,[?] it seems as if the
physical interpretation of the Casimir force depends on what physical models or
mathematical methods we used, but not on the expression of physical reality.

In this letter, we used a new concise method to calculate the ground-state
energy of the EM ﬁeld and matter interacting system. The obtained vacuum
energy is obviously lower than that of the unperturbed vacuum state and that
given by the second-order perturbation theory.[?] So the new state can be re-
garded as the real vacuum state of the interacting system. We may use this state
to interpret the source of the Casimir force. In the discussion, we have dealt
with the EM ﬁeld and the matter ﬁeld on the same basis. This is very important
to the interpretation of the Casimir force because relevant physical observables

are expressed in terms of eigenvalues and eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian of
the entire system[?] according to postulates in quantum mechanics.

In the Hamiltonian of the interacting system, i.e., H0 + HI (Eqs. (3) and
(4)), there are two points in connection with the distance (d) between the two
dielectric plates. On the one hand, the surface plasmon (such as its frequency
ωb) does depend both on the parameters of the dielectric surface and on that of
the space between the two plates, and therefore it must be related to the distance
d. On the other hand, the EM mode (such as the frequency ωa) is aﬀected by
the boundary condition and dielectric constant and therefore is related to the
distance d too. The EM ﬁeld can alter the properties of surface plasmon (such
as the frequency ωb) by the interaction between the two ﬁelds. For example, this
interaction exists only in a thin ﬁlm beneath the surface of a perfectly conducting
metal. Therefore we know that all the physical quantities, such as ωa, and ωb,
and all the coupling coeﬃcients v+, v−, v∗
− in the Hamiltonian (3) and
(4) depend on the distance (d) between the two dielectric plates. In summary,
the vacuum state (Eq. (5)) and the eigenenergy E (Eq. (15)) of the interacting
system depend on the distance d.

+ and v∗

Because the Casimir force is derived from the change in the ground-state
energy (E ) with respect to a virtual inﬁnitesimal displacement of the dielec-
tric plates, i.e., fCasimir = − ∂E
∂d , we have the conclusion that Casimir eﬀect is
attributable to the quantum ﬂuctuations of the combined vacuum state of the
EM ﬁeld and the matter ﬁeld. It is the interaction between the two ﬁelds that
produces the Casimir eﬀect.

In summary, we have presented a new concise method for the calculation
of the ground-state energy of the interacting system of the EM ﬁeld and mat-
ter ﬁeld. With the assumption of squeezed-like state, a new vacuum state is
obtained for the interacting system. The energy of the vacuum state is lower
than that given by the second-order perturbation theory.[?] Based on the new
vacuum state, the Casimir eﬀect is attributed to the ﬂuctuations in zero-point
energy of the vacuum state of the interacting system. Both EM ﬁeld and matter
ﬁeld are responsible for the Casimir eﬀect.

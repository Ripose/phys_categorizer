When a laser pulse impinges on a molecule which is invariant under certain symmetry opera-
tions selection rules for harmonic generation (HG) arise. In other words: symmetry controls which
channels are open for the deposition and emission of laser energy—with the possible application
of ﬁltering or ampliﬁcation. We review the derivation of HG selection rules and study numerically
the interaction of laser pulses with an eﬀectively one-dimensional ring-shaped model molecule. The
harmonic yields obtained from that model and their dependence on laser frequency and intensity are
discussed. In a real experiment obvious candidates for such molecules are benzene, other aromatic
compounds, or even nanotubes.

I. INTRODUCTION

Harmonic generation (HG) from atoms (L’Huillier & Balcou 1993), molecules (Liang et al. 1994), clusters (Donelly
et al. 1996), and solids (von der Linde et al. 1995) as a short-wavelength source is of great practical relevance. In
recent years a huge amount of publications were devoted to “harmonic engineering,” under which we subsume either
the study of phase matching during the propagation of the emitted light through gaseous media (Gaarde et al. 1998),
generation of attosecond pulses using varying ellipticity (Antoine et al. 1997), multi-color studies (Milosevic et al.
2000), or HG from thin crystals (Faisal & Kaminski 1996 and 1997). Experimental results on HG from cyclic organic
molecules were also reported in the literature (Hay et al. 2000a and 2000b). However, the authors made no attempt
to verify theoretically predicted selection rules. In the well established physical picture of HG one assumes that an
electron tunnels out of the atom or ion, moves in the laser ﬁeld and eventually rescatters with its parent (or other) ion
where it might recombine—leading to an emission of a photon with several times the fundamental frequency (Becker
et al. 1997). Assuming such a viewpoint one can easily explain prominent features of HG spectra such as the famous
cut-oﬀ at Ip + 3.17Up in the single atom case (where Ip is the ionization energy and Up is the ponderomotive energy,
i.e., the cycle-averaged quiver energy of the electron in the laser ﬁeld). For a general overview on harmonic generation
in laser ﬁelds see the recent review by Sali`eres et al. (1999).

Fortunately, to derive the selection rules for harmonic emission only symmetry considerations are necessary (Alon
et al. 1998). We now brieﬂy summarize this approach. Let us consider a Hamiltonian which is periodic in time, i.e.,
H(t) = H(t + τ ). Such a Hamiltonian might describe an electron in a long laser pulse where the pulse envelope is
suﬃciently adiabatic. The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) reads (we use atomic units ¯h = e = m = 1
throughout, if not noted otherwise)

According to the Floquet theorem (see, e.g., Faisal 1987) we can write ΨE(r, t) = ψE (r, t) exp(

the so-called quasi energy and HF the Floquet Hamiltonian. Since ψE (r, t) is periodic in time it might be
with

E (r). This Floquet approach is a well-known method
expanded in a Fourier series ψE (r, t) =
in multiphoton physics (Gavrila 1992) and a widely used numerical simulation technique also (Potvliege 1998). In
order to derive the HG selection rules we now assume (for reasons which will become clear soon) that the system is
in a single and non-degenerate Floquet state ψE. The HG spectra (HGS) peak no. n is present only if the Fourier
transformed dipole moment µ(r) does not vanish for the frequency nω,

The last step in (5) is not possible if ψE is not a pure Floquet state. In the next Section we apply (6) to derive the
selection rule for HG from ring-shaped molecules. Here, for the sake of illustration, we rederive the selection rule
for a single atom with spherically symmetric potential V (r) and linearly (in x-direction) polarized laser ﬁeld E(t) =
ˆEex sin ωt. The Floquet Hamiltonian HF (t) =

case. In Section III we present and discuss our numerical results. Finally, in Section IV we give a summary and an

II. A SIMPLE ONE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL FOR RING-LIKE MOLECULES

The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) for a single electron in a laser ﬁeld E(t) and under the inﬂuence

of an ionic potential V (r) reads in dipole approximation and length gauge

The dipole approximation is excellent since in all the cases studied in this paper the wavelength of the laser light is
much greater than the size of the molecule.

If we force the electron to move along a ring of radius ρ in the xy-plane V (r) becomes V (ϕ) where ϕ is the
usual polar angle. With an electric ﬁeld of the form E(t) = ˆE(t)
, where ˆE(t) is a
slowly varying envelope, ω is the laser frequency, and ξ is the ellipticity parameter, the TDSE (7) becomes eﬀectively

We now assume that the potential V (ϕ) has an N -fold rotational symmetry, V (ϕ + 2π/N ) = V (ϕ). Then, with the
help of (6), we can easily derive the selection rule for HG in the system described by the TDSE (9). The transformation
(ϕ
t + 2π/N ω) leaves the corresponding Floquet Hamiltonian invariant. For, e.g., anti-clockwise
polarized emission µ(r) = ρ exp(iϕ) holds, and from (6) we have

with N = 6 and V0 = 0.6405. This leads to an electronic ground state energy
0.34 which is the experimental
ionization potential for removing the ﬁrst electron in benzene (see, e.g., Talebpour et al. 1998 and 2000). Note, that
0.27
in our simple model we have no continuum but discrete states only. The ﬁrst six excited states are located at
(two-fold degenerated),
0.07 (two-fold degenerated), 0.16 (non-degenerated), 0.48 (non-degenerated), 0.85 (two-fold
degenerated), 1.48 (two-fold degenerated). The energy levels of our model resemble, apart from an overall downshift
and the removal of degeneracies of certain states, those of the isoperimetric model where V0 = 0, the energy levels
= 0 two-fold degenerated. Therefore, the energy level
are given by
spacing, and thus typical electronic transitions, are diﬀerent from those in real benzene. However, it is not our goal
to present quantitatively correct results for laser benzene-interaction in this paper but we rather want to demonstrate
some of the underlying principles of HG from ring-shaped molecules in general.

In Fig. 1 we present HGS for a q = 240 cycle pulse of the shape ˆE(t) = ˆE sin2 (ωt/2q) with an electric ﬁeld
amplitude ˆE = 0.5 a.u. and frequency ω = 0.18. In Fig. 1a the result for linear polarization ξ = 1 is shown, in Fig. 1b
the result for circular polarization ξ = 1/√2. To obtain those plots we evaluated the Fourier transformed dipole in
x-direction, i.e.,
. In the ξ = 1-case the dipole with respect to y is clearly zero while
in the circular case there is simply a phase shift of π/2 with respect to the dipole in x. As expected, in the linearly
1, k = 1, 2, . . . are
polarized ﬁeld all odd harmonics are emitted whereas in the circular case only the harmonics 6k
visible. Other emission lines are many orders of magnitude weaker. Those lines can form band-like structures which
are interesting in itself. However, in this paper we focus only on the laser harmonics. They dominate the HGS, at
least as long as no resonances are hit.

In Fig. 2 the emitted yield of the fundamental and the ﬁrst four harmonics (5th, 7th, 11th, 13th) in a circularly
polarized laser pulse are presented as a function of the laser frequency. The pulse length T = 8378 a.u. (corresponding
1015 W/cm2) were held ﬁxed. The frequency

is plotted in units of the smallest level spacing of the model molecule, i.e., the energy gap between ﬁrst excited and
0.27 = 0.07. For laser frequencies ω < Ω we do not ﬁnd the 7th or
ground state, which is in our case Ω = 0.34
higher harmonics. The 11th and 13th harmonic show an overall decrease with increasing laser frequency whereas
the fundamental, the 5th and the 7th stay relatively constant in intensity. For frequencies ω < 2.5Ω there is a
complicated dependency of the harmonic yield on ω. All harmonics show a local maximum around 1.3Ω. However,
at that frequency one apparently hits a resonance since the harmonic peaks become broad and show a substructure
(see left inlay in Fig. 2). In the interval 2 < ω/Ω < 2.5 the fundamental drops whereas the 7th harmonic increases
in strength. Note that the 7th harmonic is anti-clockwise polarized, like the incident laser ﬁeld, whereas the 5th is
polarized in the opposite direction. For frequencies ω > 2.5Ω the behavior becomes more smooth apart from another
resonance near 3.8Ω. In general, the HGS look clean for suﬃciently high frequencies and far away from resonances
(like in the right inlay of Fig. 2). A rich substructure near resonances is visible in the HGS (cf. inlay for ω = 2Ω).

In Fig. 3 harmonic yields for the ﬁxed frequency ω = 2.8Ω as a function of the ﬁeld amplitude ˆE are shown. The
higher harmonics (11th–19th) appear only for higher ﬁeld strengths whereas fundamental, 5th and 7th are rather
weakly dependent on the ﬁeld strength. The anti-clockwise polarized harmonics (polarized like the incident laser
light, drawn thick) tend to overtake the clockwise polarized ones (drawn thin) at higher laser intensities. However,
ˆE = 0.6 corresponds already to a laser intensity 1.3
1016 W/cm2 where a real benzene molecule would probably
break.

It is interesting to study the scaling of the TDSE (8) with respect to the size of the molecule. If one scales the
molecule radius like ρ′ = αρ, the TDSE (8) remains invariant if t′ = α2t, V ′ = V /α2, E′ = E/α3, ω′ = ω/α2 is chosen.
From this and our numerical result that laser frequencies > Ω are preferable for clean HGS we learn that molecules
bigger than benzene are more promising candidates for HG with realistic laser frequencies [from Nd (ω = 0.04 a.u.)
to KrF (ω = 0.18 a.u.)].

One might object that electron correlation could spoil the selection rule because in reality it is not only a single
electron which participates in the dynamics. However, Alon et al. (1998) have proven that this is not the case. This is
due to the fact that (i) the electron interaction part of the Hamiltonian is still invariant under the transformation
,
P
and (ii)
commutes with the (anti-) symmetrization operator. Even approximate theories or numerical techniques
like time-dependent Hartree-Fock or density functional theory do not spoil the selection rule since they involve only
functionals which depend on scalar products of single particle orbitals, all invariant under the transformation
(Ceccherini & Bauer 2001).

IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

In this paper we demonstrated numerically HG from a model molecule with discrete rotational symmetry which is
subject to a circularly polarized laser pulse. In particular the harmonic emission from an eﬀectively 1D model with
N = 6 (i.e., a simple model for benzene) as a function of laser frequency and intensity was discussed. It was found
that for frequencies below the characteristic level spacing Ω HG is strongly aﬀected by resonances. The situation
relaxes for higher frequencies. For the eﬃcient generation of higher harmonics laser frequencies > Ω and rather strong
ﬁelds are necessary. In such ﬁelds real aromatic compounds probably ionize and dissociate already.

Numerical studies for a more realistic, eﬀectively 2D model molecule will be presented elsewhere (Ceccherini &

Bauer 2001).

In order to obtain short wavelength radiation it is desirable to have either k or N in the selection rule kN

1 as big
as possible. From our numerical results we infer that it is probably hard to push eﬃciently towards high k without
destroying the target molecule. For that reason, in a real experiment nanotubes are promising candidates because N
can be of the order of 100 or more (Dresselhaus et al. 1998), and, moreover, HG should be even more eﬃcient when
the laser propagates through the tube. However, it remains the problem of the proper alignment of the laser beam
and the symmetry axis of the molecule. Crystals might be better candidates in that respect.

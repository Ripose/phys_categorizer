photoassociation of a Bose-Einstein condensate

We theoretically examine Raman photoassociation of a Bose-Einstein condensate, revisiting stim-
ulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). Due to collisional mean-ﬁeld shifts, eﬃcient molecular
conversion requires strong coupling and low density, either of which can bring about rogue photodis-
sociation to noncondensate modes. We demonstrate explicitly that rogue transitions are negligible
for low excited-state fractions and photodissociation that is slower than the STIRAP timescale.
Moreover, we derive a reduced-parameter model of collisions, and thereby ﬁnd that a gain in the
molecular conversion eﬃciency can be obtained by adjusting the atom-atom scattering length with
oﬀ-resonant magnetoassociation. This gain saturates when the atom-atom scattering length is tuned
to a speciﬁc fraction of either the molecule-molecule or atom-molecule scattering length. We con-
clude that a fully-optimized STIRAP scheme may oﬀer the best chance for achieving coherent
conversion from an atomic to a molecular condensate with photoassociation.

INTRODUCTION

tion) [15, 16, 17, 18, 19].

Photoassociation occurs when a pair of colliding ul-
tracold atoms absorb a laser photon [1], thereby jump-
ing from the two-atom continuum to a bound molecular
state. If the initial atoms are Bose-condensed [2, 3, 4, 5],
then the subsequent molecules will also form a Bose-
Einstein condensate [6, 7, 8]. On the other hand, the
process known as the Feshbach resonance [9], which we
refer to as magnetoassociation, occurs when two ultra-
cold atoms collide in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld,
whereby the spin of one of the colliding atoms ﬂips, and
the pair might then jump from the two-atom continuum
to a bound molecular state [10, 11]. As with collective
photoassociation, the so-formed molecules will comprise
a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) if the incident atoms
are themselves Bose-condensed [12, 13, 14].

Early theories of collective association accounted only
for the condensates, neglecting noncondensate modes [6,
7, 8, 12, 13, 14]. Rogue [15, 16], or unwanted [17, 18, 19],
transitions to noncondensate modes occur because the
dissociation of a zero-momentum BEC molecule need
not take the atoms back to the zero-momentum atomic
condensate, but may just as well end up creating two
noncondensate atoms with equal-and-opposite momenta.
Since the collective condensate coupling scales like the
square root of the laser intensity (Feshbach-resonance
width) and the dissociation rate scales like the intensity
(width), rogue dissociation is expected to play a dom-
inant role in strong photoassociation (magnetoassocia-

Pioneering experiments [20] with photoassociation
of 87Rb condensate were found to be just on the
verge [15] of coherent atom-molecule conversion. Next-
generation Na [21] and 7Li [22] experiments were aimed
at the strongly interacting regime, and probed the pre-
dicted [15, 16, 19] photoassociation rate limit. Mean-
while, groundbreaking experiments in magnetoassocia-
tion of a Na condensate demonstrated a tunable scat-
tering length [23], as well strong condensate losses for
sweeps of the magnetic ﬁeld across resonance [24]. Sub-
sequent experiments in Feshbach-tuning the scattering
length led to the formation of stable 85Rb [25] and
137Cs [26] condensates–which are otherwise incondensible
in signiﬁcant fractions due to uncooperative (zero-ﬁeld)
scattering lengths [27], as well as a controlled collapse
of a condensate with bursts of atoms emanating from a
remnant condensate [28], a counterintuitive decrease in
condensate losses for an increasing interaction time [29],

out that rogue dissociation is at the heart of these mag-
netoassociation experiments [31, 32, 33, 34].

When it comes down to creating a molecular conden-
sate, the catch to photoassociation is that it generally
occurs to an electronically-excited state, and the subse-
quent irreversible losses to spontaneous decay defeat the
purpose of molecular coherence. Adding a second laser
to drive molecular population to a stable electronic state,
stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) [35] in
photoassociation [36, 37, 38] of a Bose-Einstein conden-
sate [39, 40, 41, 42] has been proposed as a means for
avoiding radiative decay. Likewise, combining STIRAP
with near-resonant magnetoassociation is also a viable
means to avoid spontaneous decay when creating a sta-
ble molecular BEC [43, 44, 45, 46], although the laser
spectroscopy (bound-bound-bound) is diﬀerent from the

usual photoassociation (free-bound-bound).

The hallmark of STIRAP is the counterintuitive pulse
sequence, which in photoassociation of a BEC amounts to
adjusting the two lasers so that in the beginning, when
the system is mainly atomic condensate, the strongest
coupling is between the excited-molecular and stable-
molecular condensates, while in the end, when eﬀectively
everything is in the target state, the strongest coupling
is between the atomic and excited-molecular condensate.
As the population is transferred between the atomic and
stable-molecular condensates, the state with the larger
population is always weakly coupled to the electronically-
excited molecular condensate, and the subsequently low
(ideally zero) population reduces (eliminates) radiative
losses. In principle, STIRAP allows for complete conver-
sion from an atomic to a molecular condensate.

In practice, however, free-bound-bound STIRAP re-
lies on a superposition that includes the atoms and
stable molecules but excludes the electronically-excited
molecules [39], and the conversion eﬃciency is reduced
from unity when this so-called dark state [47] is disrupted
by collisions between particles.
Speciﬁcally, mean-
ﬁeld shifts due to collisions between condensate parti-
cles (atom-atom, atom-molecule, and molecule-molecule)
make it diﬃcult to achieve STIRAP by moving the sys-
tem oﬀ the required two-photon resonance [40, 41]. Such
two-photon frequency shifts lead to a larger excited-state
fraction, and thus more losses to radiative decay, which
of course reduces the molecular conversion eﬃciency, de-
feating the purpose of collective conversion. Neverthe-
less, the collisional interaction strength is directly propor-
tional to density, and the conversion eﬃciency can be im-
proved by treating the density as an optimization param-
eter [42]. Another collision-avoidance option is STIRAP
in an optical lattice with two particles per site [48], al-
though this scheme is not many-body coherent.

The purpose of this Article is to re-investigate Raman
photoassociation of a nonideal Bose-Einstein condensate,
focusing on improving the eﬃciency of STIRAP from an
atomic to a molecular condensate. In Sec. II, we intro-
duce the model and brieﬂy review the idea of improving
the molecular conversion eﬃciency by reducing the den-
sity. Because this system is in fact strongly coupled, for
low density or otherwise, and because rogue photodis-
sociation to noncondensate modes can be prominent for
strongly coupled systems, Sec. III explicitly demonstrates
that rogue transitions are negligible when the excited-
state fraction is low and photodissociation is slow com-
pared to the STIRAP timescale. The main contribution
of this work is given in Sec. IV, which illustrates that
the conversion eﬃciency can be further improved by tun-
ing the atomic scattering length with oﬀ-resonant mag-
netoassociation. Overall discussion is given in Sec. V.

It is evident from Eqs. (4) that, for a two-photon res-
onance (∆ = 0), the dark state is an eigenstate of the
system with all atoms (stable molecules) for Ω/χ
0
(Ω/χ
), and zero excited molecules; hence, for an
initial BEC and adiabatic counterintuitive pulses, the
two-photon-resonant system will follow this eigenstate as
it evolves from atoms into stable molecules. The presence
of collisions, which introduce a time-dependent shift of
the two-photon detuning, means that the system cannot

demonstrated explicitly in Fig. 2. Setting the mean-ﬁeld-
shift terms to zero, Λij = 0, we see in Fig. 2 (a) that
STIRAP works exactly as expected for a near-adiabatic
pulse sequence, losing only a small fraction of particles
to spontaneous decay. Reinstating collisions, Fig. 2 (b)
shows an order of magnitude increase in the excited-state
fraction, and a corresponding decrease in the conversion
eﬃciency of some two orders of magnitude, as sponta-
neous decay gets the upper hand.

atomic to a molecular condensate [42]. This idea was
spawned in our development of Feshbach-stimulated pho-
toproduction of stable molecular condensates [32] (see
also related work [50]). Consider for example the den-
105 s−1,
sity ρ = 4.3
Λ11 = 213 s−1, Λ33 = 107 s−1, and Λ13 = 277 s−1. The
mean-ﬁeld shifts are then roughly three orders of mag-
nitude smaller than the peak Bose-enhanced free-bound
coupling χ0, and since χ0 sets the timescale for atom-
molecule STIRAP [39], we expect a smaller role for par-
ticle interactions compared to when ρ = ρ0. This intu-
ition is conﬁrmed in Fig. 2 (c). Note that pulses with
asymmetric heights [40, 41] improve the short-pulse eﬃ-
ciency of STIRAP by more than an order of magnitude
over pulses with symmetric heights, as can be seen by
comparing the ﬁnal stable fraction in Fig. 2 (b) with the
stable fraction for ρ/ρ0 = 1 in Fig. 2 (c). The opti-
1012 cm−3,
mal density for these pulse parameters is ˜ρ
for which conversion to a molecular BEC occurs on a
50 ms. Optimizing the de-
timescale T = 5

tunings and pulse parameters [41] should give even fur-
ther improvement (see also Ref. [44]).

III. ROGUE PHOTODISSOCIATION TO
NONCONDENSATE MODES

As mentioned in the introduction, transitions to non-
condensate modes occur because, although formed from
a pair of zero-momentum BEC atoms, a condensate
molecule need not photodissociate back to the atomic
condensate, but may just as well form a noncondensate
atom pair with equal and opposite momentum. Although
experiments remain inconclusive on this score [21, 22], a
rate limit is to be expected when the conversion to rogue-
dissociated atom pairs dominates over the formation of
molecular condensate [15, 16, 19]. Similarly, the losses
for across-resonance sweeps [25], as well as the counter-
intuitive losses [29], observed in 85Rb magnetoassociation
experiments can be viewed as collective rapid adiabatic
passage from BEC to rogue-dissociated atoms pairs [32];
also, the remnant-burst oscillations [30] are identiﬁed as
Ramsey fringes in the evolution between an atomic con-
densate and a molecular condensate dressed by noncon-
densate atom pairs [31, 32, 33, 34].

The prime indicator of rogue dominance is the density-
dependent frequency ωρ = ~ρ2/3/m [6, 15, 16]. When
the collective-enhanced atom-molecule coupling satisﬁes
χ0 & ωρ, transitions to noncondensate modes are ex-
pected to dominate atom-molecule conversion. For the
previous example of ρ = 4.3
∼
100 ωρ; moreover, even for a typical density (ρ = ρ0 =

It is therefore
reasonable to suspect that rogue photodissociation could
play a dominant role in STIRAP from an atomic to a
molecular condensate, for low-density systems or other-
wise.

The purpose of this section is to apply our minimal-yet-

The simplest energy dependence for the continuum is one
that obeys the Wigner threshold law up to some abrupt

the cutoﬀ is inﬁnite, and therefore so is the continuum

this divergence, one deﬁnes the so-called physical detun-

limit of an inﬁnite cutoﬀ.

In practice, any numerical procedure employs a ﬁnite
cutoﬀ, and the ﬁnite shift is accounted for in exactly
the same manner. Hence, the intermediate detunings in
Eqs. (6) are taken as physical (renormalized) detunings.
Anticipating low noncondensate fractions, the normal
density–Bose enhancement of the noncondensate modes–

That said, we report numerical STIRAP solutions of
the mean-ﬁeld theory (6) for rogue transitions to non-
condensate modes in Raman free-bound-bound photoas-
sociation of a BEC. The focus is on the lowest density
1010 cm−3, as an explicit example
from Fig. 2, ρ = 4.3

In this case, not only is the coupling strong to begin
with, but we have an especially low density. Here the
rogue coupling is a bit stronger, due to the low density,
leading to a slightly larger noncondensate fraction. But,
due to the fact that mean-ﬁeld shifts are eﬀectively elim-
inated for the lowest density, the bound state fraction
is in this case the lowest. In the end, even for this low

Whereas the system is strongly coupled even for large densi-

densate modes.

density, we see that rogue photodissociation to noncon-
densate modes does not aﬀect the ﬁnal stable-molecule
conversion eﬃciency. We have conﬁrmed that, for arti-
ﬁcially large rogue couplings ξ & 1, i.e., faster photodis-
sociation, rogue noncondensate modes indeed begin to
play a more invigorated role. Also, if the timescale for
STIRAP is lengthened too much, we expect that rogies
should likewise begin to dominate.

IV. FESHBACH TUNING STIRAP

As we have already seen, reducing the density of the
initial atomic condensate acts to marginalize collisional
mean-ﬁeld shifts of the two-photon resonance, leading to
an improvement in the eﬃciency of STIRAP from an
atomic to a molecular condensate. With this idea in
mind, it seems possible that collisional mean-ﬁeld shifts
could be further marginalized by adjusting the atom-
atom scattering length via oﬀ-resonant magnetoassoci-
ation. We address this problem by ﬁrst rewriting the
Hamiltonian (2) in a form that makes the mechanics of
the Feshbach-tuned eﬃciency more transparent.

Neglecting rogue photodissociation to noncondensate
modes as per the previous section, consider now the total
number of particles, which is given by the operator

N = a†a + 2(b†b + g†g).

(11)

i.e.,

Due to the damping term (
iγs) in the Hamiltonian (2),
∝
it cannot be said that N is a conserved quantity. Never-
theless, it is certainly true that N commutes with the
[H, N ] = 0, regardless of the non-
Hamiltonian,
Hermitian nature of H.
It is then reasonable to pre-
sume that one may add multiples of N to the Hamilto-
nian without altering the essential physics. For example,
it is implicitly accepted that the two free Hamiltonians
H0/~ = 1

will give the same physics, and the two are of course re-

We have made an extensive numerical comparison be-
tween the solutions to reduced-parameter mean-ﬁeld
model (13) and the solutions to the conventional mean-
ﬁeld model (3). As expected, the conventional and
reduced-parameter mean-ﬁeld equations of motion lead
to exactly the same physics. Moreover, we have also con-
ﬁrmed that, barring a ﬂuke in the scattering length(s),
collisions with the excited-state are safely ignored.

Besides reducing the number of parameters, it seems
that Λ′
33 = 0, which corresponds to a11 = a33/8, is a spe-
cial case that could further improve the molecular con-
version eﬃciency. Indeed, reducing the scattering length
produces another marked gain in the molecular conver-
sion eﬃciency [Fig. 4 (a)]. The gain saturates because
λ11 is steadily decreasing, so that λ′
λ33. Similar
saturation is shown in Fig. 4 (b) for λ′
13 = 0, but any
gain here is outweighed by the fact that a11 < 0 desta-
bilizes the initial BEC against collapse, although a sys-
tem where a13 > 0 may prove otherwise. Again, further
improvements can be achieved by optimizing the laser
parameters [41, 44].

Before closing, we extend our model to explicitly de-
scribe tuning the scattering length via magnetoassocia-
tion. Hence, in addition to the primary-photoassociation
molecular state, the BEC atoms are coupled to a sec-
ond molecular state, denoted by the operator φ, with a
Feshbach resonance. For well-resolved resonances, light-
driven transitions involving the Feshbach state are ne-
glected just as, for example, direct free-bound photoasso-
ciation transitions are neglected in Feshbach-stimulated
photoproduction of molecular BEC [43, 45]. The Hamil-
tonian is then appended to read

According to Fig. 4, we are looking at about an order
of magnitude decrease in the scattering length. For con-
[˜Λ11] = Λ11/10, which translates
creteness, we assume
into the magnetic ﬁeld position B = B0 + 0.9∆B. The
question is then whether this is suﬃciently detuned from
resonance to justify neglect of dissociative and relax-
ational losses. The ultracold magnetodissociation rate
is [51] Γd = a11∆µ∆Bp/~2, where p is the relative atom-

1012 cm−3 is achieved solely by reducing the fre-

quency of the trap from νt = 100 s−1 to νt ∼
STIRAP timescale is then fast enough to allow inclusion
of the trap with an average over a Thomas-Fermi den-
sity distribution [5], which should not drastically alter
the predicted optimal density.

∼

Also, the Raman-formed molecules can be vibra-
tionally hot [41], and molecule-molecule and atom-
molecule collisions may thus foster relaxation to lower-
lying vibrational levels. This vibrational quenching is
accounted for in exactly the same fashion as already pre-
sented in Sec. 4 for the Feshbach molecular state. An ex-
act value for the 87Rb2 quenching rate (per unit density)
is unknown (hence the neglect in Ref. [41]), although the
ρ < 10−10 cm3/s has been measured [20].
upper bound Γ′
At this rate, vibrational quenching could well be an issue,
1012 cm−3. However,
even for the optimal density ˜ρ
a lower peak bound-bound Rabi coupling (Ω0/χ0 = 50
compared to 103 [41]) means that, for the same bound-
bound laser intensities, it should be possible to target
lower-lying levels. Because the vibrational-relaxation
rate decreases with decreasing binding energy [53], tar-
geting lower-lying vibrational levels should also lead to
slower relaxation rates. In the end, vibrational quenching
should be manageable.

The remaining concern is whether the photoassociation
laser will overlap with the expanded BEC cloud for user-
friendly intensities. If not, then the cloudsize could be
reduced by adjusting the number of condensate atoms;
additionally, Feshbach-tuning the scattering length will

˜ρ is achieved by lowering the
number of atoms to N = 104, the scattering length to

we ﬁnd that the cloudsize is only barely increased from

R0 = 8.9 µm to R = 11 µm. By optimizing the number of
atoms, the trap frequency and atomic scattering length,
overlap between the BEC cloud and the photoassociation
laser should be manageable for user-friendly intensities.
Previously [15], we have argued that experimental Ra-
man photoassociation of a BEC [20] is on the verge of
coherent conversion. The experiments in question are
performed with continuous-wave lasers and spontaneous
decay from the primary photoassociation state is man-
aged with a large intermediate detuning. To enable
coherent phenomena, the two-photon Rabi frequency,
χΩ/δ, must be of the order of the two-photon spon-
taneous decay linewidth, Ω2γs/2δ2, a condition that is
not quite satisﬁed in the Wynar et al. [20] experiments.
On the other hand, atom-atom collisions are also an is-
sue in achieving continuous-wave coherence, and avoid-
ing them by increasing the laser intensity and decreas-
ing the density could potentially bring rogue photodisso-
ciation and laser-cloud overlap into play. Our opinion
remains that coherent continuous-wave conversion can
only be achieved by a diﬃcult-to-impossible balance of
laser intensity and condensate density. This bottleneck
is probably not unique to the 87Rb system.

The present work has examined transient stimulated
Raman adiabatic passage in photoassociation of a freely-
interacting condensate in the presence of rogue and radia-
tive decay. We have shown that rogue photodissociation
to noncondensate modes is generally negligible, and that
radiative decay, enhanced by collisional mean-ﬁeld shifts,
can be managed by adjusting the initial condensate den-
sity and the atom-atom scattering length. In conclusion,
a fully-optimized STIRAP scheme–i.e., where the detun-
ings, pulse-sequence parameters (heights, widths, spac-
ing, and number of sequences), particle number, trap
parameters, and atomic scattering length are optimized–
oﬀers probably the best chance for achieving coherent
atom-molecule conversion in photoassociation.

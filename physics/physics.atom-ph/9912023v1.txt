Abstract

The aim of this work is to identify the mechanisms responsible for very
large rates and other peculiarities observed in low-energy positron annihilation
on molecules. The two mechanisms considered are: (i) Direct annihilation of
the incoming positron with one of the molecular electrons. This mechanism
dominates for atoms and small molecules. I show that its contribution to the
annihilation rate can be related to the positron elastic scattering cross sec-
tion. This mechanism is characterized by strong energy dependence of Zeﬀ at
small positron energies and high Zeﬀ values (up to 103) for room temperature
positrons, if a low-lying virtual level or a weakly bound state exists for the
positron. (ii) Resonant annihilation, which takes place when the positron un-
dergoes resonant capture into a vibrationally excited quasibound state of the
positron-molecule complex. This mechanism dominates for larger molecules
capable of forming bound states with the positron. For this mechanism Zeﬀ
averaged over some energy interval, e.g., due to thermal positron energy distri-
bution, is proportional to the level density of the positron-molecule complex,
which is basically determined by the spectrum of molecular vibrational states
populated in the positron capture. The resonant mechanism can produce very
108. It is highly sensitive to
large annihilation rates corresponding to Zeﬀ ∼
molecular structure and shows a characteristic ε−1/2 behaviour of Zeﬀ at small
positron energies ε. The theory is used to analyse calculated and measured
Zeﬀ for a number of atoms and molecules.

I. INTRODUCTION

The aim of this work is to develop the framework for the description of low-energy
positron annihilation on molecules, and to analyse its two main mechanisms: direct and res-
onant annihilation. There are a number of remarkable phenomena associated with this pro-
cess: very large annihilation rates [1–3], high sensitivity of the rates to small changes in the
molecular structure [4], large ionization-fragmentation cross sections for organic molecules
at sub-Ps-threshold positron energies [5], and rapid increase of the fragmentation and anni-
hilation rates towards small positron energies [6,7]. In spite of decades of study, there is no
consistent physical picture or even general understanding of these processes, and there have
been very few calculations [8], which leaves too much room for speculations [9]. My main
objective is to consider real mechanisms of positron annihilation on molecules, describe their
characteristic features, make estimates of the corresponding annihilation rates, and formu-
late the terms in which positron-molecule annihilation should be described and analysed.
In recent work [7], Iwata et al. describe new experiments to study positron annihilation
on molecules. Some of these experiments test speciﬁc features of the annihilation processes
described in the present paper. Though some aspects of the experimental work are discussed
here, futher details and comparison with theory and various models of positron annihilation
can be found in Ref. [7].

The annihilation rate λ for positrons in a molecular or atomic gas is usually expressed

in terms of a dimensionless parameter Zeﬀ:

where r0 is the classical radius of the electron, πr2
0c is the non-relativistic spin-averaged rate
of electron-positron annihilation into two γ quanta, and n is the number density of molecules
[10]. Equation (1) implies that Zeﬀ is the eﬀective number of target electrons contributing to
the annihilation process. In terms of the annihilation cross section σa the rate is λ = σanv,
so by comparison with Eq. (1), we have

λ = πr2

0cZeﬀn,

σa = πr2

0cZeﬀ/v,

(1)

(2)

where v is the positron velocity. Accordingly, the spin-averaged cross section of annihilation
of a non-relativistic positron on a single electron corresponds to Zeﬀ = 1, see e.g. [11]. If
the annihilation occurs during binary positron-molecule collisions, as in the experiments of
the San Diego group [3,4,12] who use a positron trap and work at low gas densities, the
parameter Zeﬀ is independent of the density. It characterizes the annihilation of a positron
on a single molecule.

One could expect that Zeﬀ is comparable to the number of electrons Z in an atom
or molecule. Moreover, low-energy positrons do not penetrate deep into the atom, and
annihilate most probably with the valence electrons only. However, even for hydrogen Zeﬀ =
8 at low energies [13]. This is a manifestation of correlation eﬀects. The most important of
αe2/2r4
them is polarization of the atom by the positron and, as a result, an attractive
positron-atom potential, α being the atomic dipole polarizability. An additional short-range
contribution to the positron-atom attraction comes from virtual Ps formation, i.e., hopping,
or rather, tunneling of an electron between the atomic ion and the positron. The electron

−

density on the positron is also enhanced due to the Coulomb attraction between them. These
eﬀects make atomic Zeﬀ large, e.g., Zeﬀ = 401 for room temperature positrons on Xe [14].

×

104 [2], and Zeﬀ ranging between 104 and 2

Even compared with this large number, annihilation rates for low-energy (room tem-
perature) positrons on polyatomic molecules are huge. They increase very rapidly with the
molecular size, and depend strongly on the chemical composition of the molecules, see Fig. 1.
104
This has been known for quite a while, after early measurements for CCl4, Zeﬀ = 2.2
106 for large alkanes CnH2n+2,
[1], butane, 1.5
106 for antracene
n =4–16 [15] (see also [4]). The largest Zeﬀ values measured so far are 4.3
106 for sebacic acid dimethyl ester C12H22O4 [15]. Thus, while Zeﬀ
C14H10 [16] and 7.5
up to ﬁve orders of magnitude greater than Z have been observed, the physical processes
responsible for these anomalously large annihilation rates have not been really understood.
In other words, if the observed Zeﬀ are parametrically large, compared to the number of
available electrons, then what are the parameters that determine large annihilation rates for
positrons on molecules?

In this work I consider two basic mechanisms of positron-molecule annihilation. The
ﬁrst mechanism is direct annihilation of the incoming positron with one of the molecular
electrons. The contribution of this mechanism to the annihilation rate is proportional to the
number of valence electrons available for annihilation. It can be enhanced by the positron-
molecule interaction which distorts the positron wave. In particular, the positron density
in the vicinity of the molecule increases greatly if a low-lying virtual state (ε0 > 0) or a
weakly bound level (ε0 < 0) exists for the s-wave positron. In this case Z (dir)

for small positron energies ε <
[17–19]. This type of enhancement is responsible for
large Zeﬀ values observed in heavier noble gas atoms, where successively lower virtual levels
exist for the positron (Zeﬀ = 33.8, 90.1 and 401 for Ar, Kr and Xe, respectively [4,14]).
This understanding is conﬁrmed by the temperature dependences of the annihilation rates
measured for the noble gases in [20]. Note that for room-temperature positrons, ε
kBT ,
even for ε0 →
0 the size of the enhancement due to virtual/weakly bound states is limited.
The second mechanism is resonant annihilation. By this I mean a two-stage process.
The positron is ﬁrst captured into a Feshbach-type resonance, where positron attachment
is accompanied by excitation of some molecular degrees of freedom. Such process is well
known for electrons [21]. The positron in the quasi bound state then annihilates with a
molecular electron. Enhancement of annihilation due to a single resonance was considered
theoretically in [22,23]. The possibility of forming such resonances by excitation of the
vibrational degrees of freedom of molecules was proposed by Surko et al. [3] to explain
high annihilation rates and their strong dependence on the molecular size observed for

by positron annihilation [24]. However,
its contribution to the annihilation have never
been properly evaluated. To make this mechanism work for low-energy positrons one must
assumed that positrons can form bound states with large neutral molecules, i.e., the positron
aﬃnity of the molecule is positive, εA > 0 [3]. The capture is then possible if the energy of
the incoming positron is in resonance with the vibrationally excited state of the positron-
molecule complex [25]. The density of the vibrational excitation spectrum of this complex
can be high, even if the excitation energy supplied by positron binding, Ev = εA + ε, is
only few tenths of an eV (it is reasonable to assume that the presence of the positron
does not change the vibrational spectrum of the molecule by too much). For positrons

number of vibrational quanta excited in positron capture, and ω is a typical molecular
vibrational frequency. Thus, the resonant annihilation mechanism can explain the rapid
increase of Zeﬀ with the size of the molecule shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, my estimates show
that for thermal positrons Z (res)

up to 108 could be observed.
A necessary condition for the resonant annihilation to occur is the existence of positron-
molecule bound states. Until recently there was almost no positive information about the
possibility of positron binding to neutral atomic species. The experimental results and their
interpretation by Surko et al. [3] could be viewed as the strongest, albeit indirect, evidence
of positron binding to large molecules. This situation has changed now. Many-body theory
calculations of Dzuba et al. [26] indicated strongly that positrons can be bound by Mg,
Zn, Cd, and Hg and, possibly, many other atoms. Recently the variational calculations of
Ryzhikh and Mitroy proved rigorously that positrons form bound states with Li atoms, and
demonstrated that bound states also exist for Na, Be, Mg, Zn, Cu and Ag [27]. Molecules
are much larger potential wells for the positron, and it seems natural that many of them
should be capable of binding positrons.

Ideas about diﬀerent mechanisms in positron-molecule annihilation have been discussed
earlier in a number of theoretical [17,23] and experimental [3,22] works. However, there is a
need to re-examine this question using a uniﬁed approach to the annihilation mechanisms,
and deﬁne clearly the physical variables which determine the observed annihilation rates.
The latter is especially important for the present work which aims to provide understanding
of a whole variety of phenomena, including the origins of the high values of Zeﬀ for molecules
and their dependence on the chemical composition and positron energy.

II. ANNIHILATION MECHANISMS

In this section a derivation of the positron annihilation rate within a standard scattering
theory formalism is presented. I show how to estimate the contributions of the direct and
resonant mechanisms, and examine speciﬁc features of these mechanisms.

determined by the positron density on the electrons

where Z is the number of target electrons, ri and r are the coordinates of the electrons
and positron, respectively, and Ψk(r1, . . . , rZ, r) is the total wave function of the system. It
describes scattering of the positron with initial momentum k from the atomic or molecular
target in the ground state Φ0, and is normalized as

where Ra is the radius of the target (atomic units are used throughout). Note that for
molecular targets Ψk and Φ0 should, strictly speaking, depend on the nuclear coordinates
as well.

Let us ﬁrst assume that the electron-positron degrees of freedom are completely decoupled
from the nuclear motion. The scattering wave function is then determined by the positron
interaction with the charge distribution of the ground-state target and electron-positron cor-
relation interaction (polarization of the target, virtual Ps formation, etc.). Let us denote the
corresponding wave function Ψ(0)
k . At positron energies of a few electron Volts the molecule
can be excited electronically, and the positron may ﬁnd itself trapped in electronically ex-
cited Feshbach resonance states. This may result in rapid resonant energy dependence of
the Ψ(0)
k wave function. However, at small sub-eV or room-temperature positron energies
electron excitations cannot be produced, and Ψ(0)
k behaves smoothly. On the other hand,
if the positron aﬃnity of a molecule is positive, the system ‘molecule + positron’ is capable
of forming a stable “positronic ion”, whose lifetime is only limited by positron annihilation.
This system will also have a number of excited bound states Φν corresponding to vibrational
excitations of the positron-molecule complex. Their typical energies are of the order of 0.1
eV and smaller, as determined by the vibrational spectrum of the molecule.

If we now turn on the coupling V between the electron-positron and nuclear degrees of

freedom the total scattering wave function will be given by

where f (Ω) is the scattering amplitude. Due to positron repulsion from the atomic nuclei
the low-energy positron does not penetrate deep inside the atomic system. Accordingly,
the positron annihilates mostly with the outer valence electrons, where the electron and
positron densities overlap. This takes place “on the surface” of the atomic system, and
Eq. (10) essentially determines the amplitude of ﬁnding the positron there. Of course,
due to short-range electron-positron correlations the true wave function at small distances
cannot be factorized similarly to Eq. (10). The Coulomb interaction between the positron
and electron increases the probability of ﬁnding both at the same point in space, as required
by the δ-function in Eq.
(3). This eﬀect enhances the annihilation rate [19]. However,
since small distances and relatively large interactions are involved, these correlations do not
depend on the momentum of the incoming positron at low energies. On the other hand, to
participate in the annihilation event the positron must ﬁrst approach the target, and this is
described by Eq. (10). Unlike the short-range correlation eﬀects, the scattering amplitude
can be very sensitive to the positron energy. This eﬀect is fully accounted for by Eq. (10),
and I use it to evaluate the energy dependence and magnitude of Z (dir)
eﬀ .

where ρ(r)
is the electron density in the ground state of the
system. The electron density drops quickly outside the atom, and the positron density
decreases rapidly inside the atom. Therefore the integration in Eq. (11) should be taken
over a relatively thin shell of thickness δRa enclosing the atomic system. Let us approximate
the integration domain by a spherical shell of radius r = Ra, where Ra is the typical distance
between the positron and the target during the annihilation, comparable to the size of the
atom or molecule. For small positron momenta, kRa < 1, Eq. (11) then yields

Note that the relation between Z (dir)

and elastic scattering given by Eq. (12) could also be
derived by matching the true many-body wave function of the positron-target system at low
energy (E
0) with the asymptotic form (10). In this case Ra will be the matching radius,
and the factor before the brackets will remain a free atomic-sized parameter. However, even
in the form (12) the electron density ρe and the overlap δRa are eﬀective parameters, and the
accurate value of the pre-factor can only be found by comparison with numerical calculations
(see Sec. III A). Nevertheless, Eq. (12) is very useful for the analysis of direct annihilation.
The three terms in brackets are due to the incoming positron plane wave, the scattered wave,
and the interference term, respectively, cf. Eqs. (10) and (11). Even if the cross section
σel is zero or very small, as in the case of a Ramsauer-Townsend minimum, the annihilation
rate Z (dir)
is nonzero. Its magnitude is determined by the eﬀective annihilation radius Ra,
electron density ρe and δRa, which gives Z (dir)
1–10, since the quantities involved have
“normal”, atomic-size values.

Equation (12) shows that the annihilation rate for slow positrons is greatly enhanced if
the scattering cross section is large. This occurs when the scattering length is large, because
the positron-target interaction supports a low-lying virtual s level (a < 0) or a weakly bound

s state (a > 0) [28]. Their energies, ε0 =

sections and annihilation rates at zero positron energy, if

momenta the s wave cross section does not exceed the unitarity limit σel = 4π/k2 (for the

C. Resonant annihilation

Unlike the direct annihilation term, the interference and the resonant terms on the right-
hand side of Eq.
(8) are rapidly varying functions of energy. The energy scale of this
variation is given by the mean spacing D between the resonances. If the resonances are due
to vibrational excitations of a single mode of the positron-molecule complex then D = ω,
with ω <
0.1 eV for a typical vibrational frequency. In a complex molecule the positron

attachment energy is suﬃcient for excitation of several modes, and D can be much smaller.
To describe the annihilation rates observed in experiments with non-monochromatic, e.g.,

≡

It is easy to see that the resonant contribution could also be derived from standard
resonant scattering theory developed originally to describe neutron scattering via compound
nucleus resonances ( [28], Ch. 18) . The maximal s-wave capture cross section is given by σ =
πk−2. The true capture cross section is smaller than σ, because the capture takes place
πλ2
only when the positron energy matches the energy of the resonance. For positrons with ﬁnite
(Γc/D)σ, where
energy spread (e.g., thermal ones), the capture cross section is then σc ∼
D is the mean energy spacing between the resonances. More accurately, σc = (2πΓc/D)σ
[28]. If we are concerned with the annihilation process, the capture cross section must be
multiplied by the probability of annihilation, Pa = Γa/(Γc + Γa), which gives the energy-
averaged resonance annihilation cross section

where averaging over resonances similar to that in Eq. (15) is assumed. By comparison with
Eqs. (2) and (7), the resonant contribution to Zeﬀ, Eq. (15), is recovered.

The way Eq. (15) has been derived implies that the positrons are captured in the s
wave. Otherwise, an additional factor of (2l + 1), where l is the positron orbital momentum,
appears in the formula [28]. At low positron energies the capture widths behave as

for resonances formed by positron capture with the orbital momentum l [28] (R is the typical
radius of the target). So, the s wave capture indeed dominates in the resonant annihilation

dominates at small k. In equations (22) and (23) C is a dimensionless positive constant.
Note that for α = 0, Eq. (21) is immediately recovered. The polarization potential modiﬁes
the behaviour of the cross section at low energies. For example, it leads to a more rapid
decrease of the cross section for a < 0, σel = 4πa2[1 + 2παk/3a + O(k2 ln k)]. However, this

11

does not change the estimates of the maximal values of Zeﬀ that could be produced in direct
annihilation.

To illustrate the relation between direct annihilation and elastic scattering, and the
enhancement of both due to the presence of a low-lying virtual level, let us compare the
behaviour of Zeﬀ and σel for Ar and Kr. The results shown in Fig. 2 were obtained within
the polarized-orbital method [33], which takes into account the polarization of the target by
the positron. These calculations yield large negative values of the scattering length for Ar,
Kr and Xe (see Table I), indicating the presence of positron-atom virtual levels formed due
to strong positron-atom attraction. The increase of
correlates with the increase of the
dipole polarizability in these atoms. Similar values of a have been obtained in the many-
body theory calculations of Dzuba et al. [19]. Figure 2 shows that both σel and Zeﬀ are
enhanced at low momenta due to the presence of the virtual s levels. This eﬀect is stronger
for Kr, which has a greater absolute value of the positron scattering length. As illustrated
by Fig. 2a for Kr, Eq. (23) provides a good description of the cross section at small k.
The visible diﬀerence between Zeﬀ and σel in Fig. 2 is due to the background given by the
energy-independent term R2

Figure 3 provides a direct comparison between Zeﬀ and the right-hand side of Eq. (12),
and shows that this relation is valid at low positron energies. The comparison is based on
the polarized-orbital method results for the noble-gas atoms [33], and the values of Zeﬀ and
σel obtained for the ethylene molecule (C2H4) by the Schwinger multichannel method [8].
In this comparison I have considered Ra and the pre-factor 4πρeδRa in Eq. (12) as ﬁtting
parameters. Their values are listed in Table I together with the values of a obtained in those
calculations. Note that the theoretical results used to produce this plot are not necessarily
“exact” or accurate (although, experimental data conﬁrm that they are reasonable [7,20]).
It follows from the derivation that Eq. (12) holds for any calculation, as long as the same
wave function is used in the scattering and annihilation calculations [35].

In agreement with the estimates made in Sec. II B, Fig. 3 shows that direct annihilation
is indeed strongly enhanced by the presence of low-lying virtual levels. Nevertheless, even
for targets with very large scattering lengths, such as Xe or C2H4, the annihilation rates do

not exceed Zeﬀ ∼
Direct annihilation is the only annihilation mechanism for atoms and molecules which
do not form bound states with positrons. It will also dominate for small molecules which do
form a weakly bound state with the positron, but whose vibrational frequencies are high. In
this case the energy εA +ε is simply insuﬃcient for the excitation of the resonant quasibound
states at low impact positron energies ε.

For large molecules the diﬀerence between the resonant and direct mechanisms is proba-
bly most obvious when one compares the experimental values of Zeﬀ for alkanes and perﬂu-
orinated alkanes shown in Fig. 1. The large annihilation rates of the alkane molecules with
more than two carbon atoms cannot be explained by direct annihilation. They also display
a very rapid increase with the size of the molecule, which is typical of resonant annihilation.
On the other hand, the Zeﬀ values of the perﬂuorinated alkanes remain comparatively small,
in spite of their softer vibrational spectra. Thus, one is lead to conclude that the resonant
mechanism is switched oﬀ for them. The latter is explained by the very weak attraction be-
tween the positron and ﬂuorine atoms [7], insuﬃcient to provide positron-molecule binding.
Let us examine the eﬀect of ﬂuorination on Zeﬀ for the lightest molecule of the series,

12

methane. The experimental data at room temperature are: Zeﬀ = 158.5, 715, 411, 127, and
38, for CH4, CH3F, CH2F2, CHF3, and CF4, respectively (data from [7,12] normalized to
the given value for methane). These values are small enough to be accounted for by the
direct mechanism. Within its framework the increase and subsequent drop of Zeﬀ could be
explained by the existence of a loosely bound state for the positron on methane, which turns
into a virtual level as the number of substitute ﬂuorine atoms increases [36]. In terms of
κ parameter this would mean that κ is small and positive for CH4, and then goes through
zero, and becomes negative upon ﬂuorination. Accordingly, both the cross section and the
annihilation rate peak for the molecule with the smallest absolute value of κ, namely CH3F.
This picture is considered in Ref. [7] in more detail using the zero-range potential model for
positron-molecule interaction.

Besides having a larger value of Zeﬀ, the molecule with a smaller

Figure 3. If the experiment is done with thermal positrons this should manifest in a stronger

whether one is dealing with Zeﬀ(k) at a speciﬁc positron momentum, or with a thermal
average Z eﬀ(T ). The temperature dependences of the annihilation rates for methane and
ﬂuoromethane measured in Ref. [7] are shown in Fig. 4. Also shown are low-temperature

chosen. The value of the characteristic radius Ra = 4 a.u.
is similar to those for noble
gas atoms and ethylene (table I), and the pre-factor 4πρeδRa = 1 is between those for
noble gas atoms and C2H4. Of course, the number of independent parameters (a, C, Ra
and 4πρeδRa) is too large to enable their unique determination from the experimental data.
However, the ﬁts clearly demonstrate that very diﬀerent Zeﬀ(T ) curves can be obtained only
due to diﬀerent κ values (κ = 0.045 and 0.01, for CH4 and CH3F, respectively. These values
imply that both molecules have bound states with the positron. The binding energy for
10−3 a.u.= 0.028 eV, and the binding energy corresponding to
CH4 is εA = κ2/2 = 1.0
κ = 0.01 is just 1 meV. There is a large uncertainty in the latter value, because measurements

small κ. This can be seen, e.g., from Eq. (21), which becomes κ-independent for κ
Zero-range model calculations presented in Ref. [7] show that the last three members of
the ﬂuoromethane sequence have negative κ, corresponding to virtual levels with increasing
energies. This causes the decrease of their Zeﬀ values.

As seen in Fig. 4, equation (12) for the direct annihilation combined with the modiﬁed
eﬀective range formula (23) works well in the low-energy part of the graph. However, the
data for methane clearly show an abrupt departure from this law at higher T , and the
formation of some kind of a plateau in Zeﬀ(T ). In principle, one could think that this is

13

due to contributions of higher partial waves, not included in σel, Eq. (23). However, their
contribution has been included via the Ra term of Eq. (12). Also, the contributions of higher
partial waves to Zeﬀ emerge as εl, which is a manifestation of the Wigner threshold law [28].
For thermally averaged rates this corresponds to T l. Thus, it cannot be responsible for this
sudden feature.

On the other hand, if the methane molecule forms a bound state with the positron the
system can also have vibrationally excited positron-molecule resonant states. The positron
bound state on CH4 must belong to the A1 symmetry type of the molecule. Since the
positron s wave dominates at low energies, its capture into the A1 state can result in the
excitation of A1 vibrational modes of the molecule. The frequency of this mode for methane
is ω = 2916 cm−1 = 0.361 eV. Assuming that the positron binding does not change this
frequency much, the lowest vibrationally excited positron-molecule resonance will occur at
ε = ω

0.33 eV.

B. Resonant annihilation: molecular vibrations and temperature dependence

1. Vibrations.

Equation (19) derived in Sec.

II C shows that the annihilation rate due to positron
capture into resonances is determined by the level density of these quasibound vibrationally
excited states of the positron-molecule complex. This density depends on the excitation
energy available, as deﬁned by the positron kinetic energy and positron aﬃnity, Ev = εA + ε,
and also on the structure of the molecular vibrational spectrum. Suppose that the molecule
possesses a particular symmetry, which is true for most of the molecules where positron
annihilation has been studied so far [4]. The electronic ground state wave function of the
molecule is usually nondegenerate and invariant under all symmetry transformations. Let
us call this symmetry type A. Depending on the actual symmetry of the molecule this can
be A1, Ag, or A1g. If the positron can be bound by such molecule, the electron-positron part
of the wave function of the positron-molecule complex will also be fully symmetric, i.e., of
the A symmetry type.

Consider now the capture of a continuous spectrum positron into the bound positron-
molecule state. At low positron energies this process is dominated by the incident positron

14

s wave, higher partial waves being suppressed as (kR)2l, compared to the s wave [cf. Eq.
(17)]. As a result, the electron-positron part of the wave function of the initial (molecule
and the s-wave positron) and ﬁnal (bound positron-molecule complex) states of the capture
process are characterized by the same full molecular symmetry A. This imposes a selection
rule on the nuclear vibrations which can be excited during the capture process. They must
also belong to the A symmetry type.

Therefore, the selection rule limits the spectrum of possible vibrationally excited reso-
nances which could in principle be formed. It allows arbitrary excitations and combinations
of the A modes. It also allows overtones and combinations of the other symmetry types,
provided such excitations contain the A symmetry type, i.e., the (symmetric) product of the
symmetry types involved contains A among its irreducible representations [28]. This does
not mean that all such vibrations will contribute to the density factor ρ(Ev) in Eq. (19) for
Zeﬀ. Some of them may have extremely weak coupling to the electron-positron degrees of
freedom, with capture widths much smaller than 1 µeV. In this case they will be eﬀectively
decoupled from the positron capture channel, and hence, will not contribute to Zeﬀ. Of
course, this can only be found out by doing detailed calculations for speciﬁc molecules.

Nevertheless, it is instructive to compare Eq. (19) with experimental data. This com-
parison enables one to extract the eﬀective mean spacing D between the positron-molecule
resonances. For experiments with thermal positrons Eq. (19) must be averaged over the
Maxwellian positron momenta distribution,

experimental Zeﬀ values measured with room-temperature positrons [4] are listed in Table
II. They are compared with the low frequency vibrational modes of the A symmetry type of
these molecules taken from Ref. [37]. As discussed above, vibrations of the A symmetry type
also occur in overtones and combinations of other modes. However, their frequencies scale
with the size and chemical composition of the molecule in a way similar to the A modes,
and the A mode frequencies listed in the table are representative of the lower vibrational
modes on the whole.

×

For molecules with moderate Zeﬀ at the top of the table, such as CCl4, the eﬀective
resonance spacing D is comparable to the frequencies of single modes. With the increase of
the size of the molecule (alkanes), or masses of the constituents (e.g., CBr4), the vibrational
modes are softened, and the number of low-frequency modes increases. At the same time
one can expect that the positron binding energy increases for these molecules. These eﬀects,
and especially the increase of the number of modes, facilitate multimode excitations, whose
density is much greater that the level density of the individual modes. Accordingly, we see
that D becomes much smaller that the frequencies of the individual modes at the bottom
of the table.

In the simplest model this eﬀect can be estimated as follows. Suppose the vibrational
modes in question are characterized by some typical frequency ω, and the molecule has Nv
such modes. Suppose, the positron binding energy is εA = nω, where n is the number of

15

vibrational quanta excited due to positron binding. If we neglect the small kinetic energy
εA, the total number of various vibrational excitations at energy Ev
of the positron, Ev ≈
is given by (Nv + n
1)!] (number of ways to distribute n vibrational quanta
1)!/[n!(Nv −
−
among Nv modes). For large molecules εA remains ﬁnite, whereas Nv increases linearly with
the size of the molecule, the total number of vibrational modes being 3N
6, where N is
the number of atoms. Therefore, the number of vibrational excitations available, and the
density of the resonant vibrational spectrum, increase as (Nv)n
N n. Such rapid increase is
indeed observed for alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons, see Fig. 1. The eﬀective number of
vibrational modes excited in the capture process, n = 6.1 and 8.2, respectively, is compatible
with the positron binding energy of few tens of an electron Volt. For example, if I use the
0.25 eV.
lowest Ag mode frequency of hexane (Table II), the positron aﬃnity is εA ∼
This number looks reasonable, compared with positron binding energies on single atoms,
e.g., εA = 0.08, 0.15, and 0.38, for Be, Cu and Mg, respectively [27,39].

Apart from the rapid growth, Zeﬀ for alkanes shows clear signs of saturation, when the
number of carbon atoms becomes greater than 8 or 10. Apparently, this takes place well
before the unitarity limit derived in Sec. II C is reached. This behaviour can be understood
if we recall that Eq.
(19) is valid only when the capture width Γc is greater than the
annihilation width Γa. With the increase of the number of vibrational modes their coupling
to the electron-positron degrees of freedom decreases. This coupling is represented by Γc,
and for small capture widths, Γc < Γa, Z (res)

where Eq. (7) is used together with r0 = c−2, in atomic units. The decrease of Γc is a simple
consequence of sum rules, because the total strength of positron coupling is distributed
among larger number of possible vibrational excitations. In this regime Γc is proportional to
D, and the increase of Z (res)
related to the increase of the density of vibrational excitation
D which characterizes this regime is well known in

neutron capture into compound resonances [40]. It takes place in complex atomic spectra,
e.g., in rare-earths, where the oscillator strengths are distributed among very large numbers

electron attachment [21], where it is responsible for very large lifetimes (i.e., small state
widths) of transient molecular anions.

2. Dependence on the positron energy or temperature.

Let us now look at the energy dependence of the resonant annihilation rate. At very small
positron energies Z (res)

The theory and experiment agree well at low temperatures. One may notice that the
measured Zeﬀ show a slightly steeper rise towards small T . However, the diﬀerence is not

A more pronounced feature of the experimental data, which is not accounted for by Eq.
(26), is the plateau observed at higher temperatures, T > 0.05 eV, where Zeﬀ goes well above
the 1/√T curve. To ﬁnd its possible origins let us ﬁrst take a closer look at Eq. (26) and its
predecessor, Eq. (19). For small impact positron energies ε the vibrational excitation energy
εA. Accordingly, the resonance density ρ(Ev) in Eq. (19), and the mean
is given by Ev ≈
spacing D in Eq. (26) are approximately constant. As the positron energy, or temperature,
increase, the resonance density factor should also increase, since ρ(Ev) is a strong function
of the excitation energy for multimode vibrational spectra. Therefore, the decrease of Z (res)
should be slower than 1/k, or 1/√T . Moreover, the density factor may even produce a rise
in the energy dependence of Z (res)
eﬀ . Besides this, contributions of higher positron partial
waves which emerge as T , T 2, etc., at small T , may also contribute to Z (res)
in the plateau
region. It might even seem that these eﬀects could lead to a rapid increase of Z (res)
eﬀ with
positron energy.

However, there is an eﬀect that suppresses the increase of resonant annihilation.
Throughout the paper I have assumed that the positron-molecule resonances have only
two decay channels, annihilation and detachment, the latter being the reverse of positron
capture. When the positron energy rises above the threshold of molecular vibrational exci-
tations, the resonances can also decay into the ‘positron + vibrationally excited molecule’
c + Γν
channels. In this situation the total width of a resonance will be given by Γν = Γν
v,
where Γν
v is the decay width due to positron detachment accompanied by the vibrational
excitation of the molecule. This leads to a modiﬁcation of Eq. (19), which now reads

This equation shows that as soon as the positron energy exceeds another inelastic vibrational-
excitation threshold, the factor in brackets drops, thereby reducing the resonant annihilation
contribution. Such downward step-like structures at vibrational thresholds are well known
in dissociative electron attachment experiments (see, e.g., Refs. [30,42]). When the positron
energy is well above the lowest inelastic vibrational threshold the “elastic” width Γc will
become much smaller than the “inelastic” width Γv, due to a large number of open inelastic
vibrational-excitation scattering channels, and due to a kinematic increase of Γv above the
respective thresholds. This will strongly suppress the resonant annihilation contribution
(28) with respect to that of Eq. (19) at larger positron energies. One may speculate that it
is precisely the increase of Γν
v that counteracts the rise of ρ(Ev), and prevents rapid growth
of Z (eﬀ)
eﬀ with positron energies. It may also be true that a similar mechanisms is behind the
dramatic drop of the dissociative attachment cross sections for projectile energies above few
lower vibrationally inelastic thresholds [21,30].

IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

In this work I have considered two possible mechanisms of low-energy positron annihila-

tion in binary collisions with molecules.

The ﬁrst mechanisms is direct annihilation. It describes positron annihilation with atoms
and small molecules, as well as molecules which do not form bound states with the positron.
The annihilation rate due to this mechanism has been related to the positron elastic scatter-
ing properties. In particular, it is enhanced when the positron has a low-lying virtual s-type
κ2/2. For zero-energy positrons the direct annihi-
level or a weakly bound state at ε0 =
±
. Small κ, together with the dipole polarizability

lation rate is inversely proportional to
|
of the target, also determine the rapid energy dependence of Zeﬀ at small positron energies.
Estimates show that for room-temperature positrons Zeﬀ of up to 103 can be produced due
the virtual/weakly bound state enhancement.

The second mechanism is resonant annihilation. It is operational when the positron forms
temporary bound states with the molecule. As a necessary condition, the positron aﬃnity
of the molecule must be positive. The positron capture is a resonant process, whereby the
energy of the positron is transferred into vibrational excitations of the positron-molecule
complex. The contribution of this mechanisms to the annihilation rate is proportional to
the level density of the positron-molecule resonances ρ. These resonances are characterized
1 µeV. For Γc > Γa its contribution is
by the capture width Γc and annihilation width Γa ∼
independent of Γc, and is basically determined by the density ρ. The resonant mechanism
can give very large annihilation rates (up to 108). Through its dependence on the vibrational
excitation spectrum of the positron-molecule complex, this mechanism shows high sensitivity
to the chemical composition of the target, and the size of the molecule. Both are essential
features of the experimental data [4].

The diﬀerence between the two mechanisms is illustrated most clearly by compari-
son of the annihilation rates of alkanes and perﬂuoroalkanes. For example, C6H14 has
Zeﬀ = 120 000, whereas for C6F14, Zeﬀ is only 630. The present theory attributes this huge
diﬀerence to the fact that perﬂuorocarbons do not form bound states with the positrons,
and hence, the resonant annihilation is switched oﬀ for them. On the other hand, this
mechanism is behind the the high Zeﬀ values of alkanes.

The experimental group at San Diego has performed a number of measurements on pro-
tonated and deuterated molecules to test the sensitivity of Zeﬀ to the molecular vibrational
modes [4,7]. For example, their data for benzene show that a replacement of a single hy-
drogen atom with deuterium changes the annihilation rate from Zeﬀ = 15 000 for C6H6 to
Zeﬀ = 36 900 for C6H5D. On the other hand, the data on fully protonated vs fully deuter-
ated alkanes shows very little diﬀerence between the two cases. Such behaviour is natural
for smaller alkanes, e.g., methane, where direct annihilation is the dominant mechanism.
However, observed for large alkanes, it cannot be readily interpreted by means of Eq. (19)
or alike.

modes which are weakly aﬀected by deuteration. On the other hand, deuteration may also
inﬂuence positron coupling to the molecular vibrations, which will most likely lead to a

In spite of these diﬃculties, which could only be resolved by doing calculations for speciﬁc

molecules, the present theory oﬀers a consistent description of positron-molecule annihila-
tion in real terms, through some well deﬁned parameters which characterize the system.
It clearly identiﬁes the two basic mechanisms of positron annihilation and discusses their
speciﬁc features. It also shows that studies of positron annihilation on molecules may give a
unique insight into the physics of molecular reactions which go through formation of vibra-
tionally excited intermediate states. Such processes are very likely to be responsible for large
dissociative electron attachment cross sections observed for molecules such as SF6. They are
also of key importance for the whole class of chemical reactions, namely, for unimolecular
reactions (see, e.g., [43]).

[35] The most accurate theoretical data on positron scattering and annihilation are available
for hydrogen. To avoid cluttering the plot the corresponding results are not presented in

[36] Experimental data for a variety of molecules show that a non-zero dipole moment of
the molecule does not have any direct eﬀect on Zeﬀ, Ref. [12]. For example, Zeﬀ = 319,
1090, and 1600, for H20, NO2, and NH3, whereas their dipole moments are 1.85, 0.32,
and 1.47 Debye, respectively. There also seems to be no correlation between Zeﬀ values
of CH3F, CH2F2, CHF3, quoted in the text, and their respective dipole moments, 1.85,
1.97, and 1.65 Debye.

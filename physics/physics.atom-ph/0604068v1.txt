We reply to the Comment of T. K. Kjeldsen and L. B. Madsen [e-print arXiv:physics/0508213]
and acknowledge their criticism related to imperfect composition of our model 3σg molecular
state [V. I. Usachenko and S.-I. Chu, Phys. Rev. A 71, 063410 (2005)]. However, we can-
not agree with the authors suggesting this critique also as an irrefutable argument and/or
evidence in support and justiﬁcation of their opposite and incorrect (viz. inconsistent with rel-
evant experiment) orientation dependence of N2 ionization rate calculated within the velocity
gauge version of molecular strong-ﬁeld approximation. We disclose the actual reason of the
contradiction and demonstrate that appropriately composed 3σg state (modiﬁed according to
the Comment’s critique) rather conﬁrms the alternative earler calculation [A. Jaron-Becker, A.
Becker and F. H. M. Faisal, Phys. Rev. A 69, 023410 (2004)] suggesting correct orientation
dependence of N2 ionization, contrary to respective results of the Comment’s authors applying
the same approach and procedure of 3σg composition.

GAUGE VERSION OF MOLECULAR STRONG-FIELD APPROXIMATION

1. INTRODUCTION.

The current state-of-the-art in strong-ﬁeld molecular ionization theory seems to be
still far away from a suﬃciently clear insight due to numerous controversial results ob-
tained within diﬀerent approaches and methods. As an appropriate illustration to mention
here is the problem of strong-ﬁeld ionization in laser-irradiated N2 molecule, which re-
cently received a special consideration within both the velocity-gauge (VG) [1-5] and the
length-gauge (LG) [3, 6] formulations of conventional strong-ﬁeld approximation (SFA) [7].
In particular, the orientation behavior of N2 ionization rates was found in [3] to be quite
diﬀerent if calculated in the VG version versus the LG version of the molecular SFA ap-
proach and/or molecular tunneling theory [8]. Based on the same self-consistent Hartree-
Fock (HF) numerical procedure as previously proposed in [1, 2] for the 3σg highest-occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) composition, the VG-SFA results [3] suggested a predominant
N2 ionization when the molecular axis is perpendicular to the incident laser ﬁeld polariza-
tion (see also Fig. 2 in the Comment [4]). Thus, in contrast to their LG-VGA results [3],
the VG-SFA results of the Comment’s authors suggest a counterintuitive behavior for N2
ionization, which contradict to both relevant experiment [9] and alternative calculation
[2]. Even though the Comment [4] applies in fact the same VG-SFA approach and numeri-
cal (HF-based) procedure of 3σg composition as earlier proposed in [1, 2], the Comment’s
authors carefully avoid of quoting the opposite results of Ref.[2] and/or clarifying the
reason of the contradiction. They prefer instead to criticize our imperfect composition of
model 3σg molecular state [5] as inappropriately symmetrized and oversimpliﬁed. More-
over, they even suggest their criticism (being physically correct and acceptable as such)
In order to demonstrate
as an indispensable explanatory reason of the contradiction.
the invalidity of such an interpretation (as well as the related Comment’s statements),
we have to identify the actual reason of the contradiction by means of applying a more
accurate molecular 3σg state appropriately modiﬁed according to the Comment’s critique.

According to the standard linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) and molec-
ular orbitals (MO) method, the molecular orbitals are the mathematical constructs used
to model the multi-electron molecular valence shells (each of a ﬁxed discrete binding en-
ergy ε(n)
of identical electrons, similar to atomic
e
orbitals in atom). For 3σg HOMO of gerade and bonding symmetry in N2 molecule un-
der consideration, the corresponding approximate two-centered single-electron molecular
wavefunction can be composed, for example, as an appropriate superposition of scaled
hydrogen-like 2pz and 1s (or 2s) atomic orbitals:

Note that presently the ”

” combination of 2pz states in Eq.(1) is used, which does
provide the even spatial parity of the (2p) 3σg HOMO. Thus, even though the ”+” com-
bination of scaled hydrogen-like 2pz atomic orbitals alone earlier used in the literature
[5, 6] to reproduce 3σg HOMO in N2 proved to be a surprisingly well working in ex-
plaining relevant experiment [10, 11], we have to mention here the correct Comment’s
critical remark that such combination doesn’t provide the even (gerade) spatial parity
and bonding symmetry of the (2p) 3σg MO. Moreover, according to the MO-SFA model
[1], the oversimpliﬁed composition (1) would result in destructive intramolecular interfer-
ence (see also [1-2, 5]) and accordingly high suppression in N2 ionization (contrary to the
experiment [10, 11], which shows no suppression). To eliminate the mentioned deﬁciency,
in our present consideration a more accurate composition of the 3σg HOMO is applied
taking into account some admixture of a comparable contribution from atomic s-states
mostly required to provide a good agreement with experiment (see also Sec.3 for details).
Thus, in compliance with the second Comment’s critical remark, the 3σg HOMO is to be
further approximated by the coherent superposition of few diﬀerent MOs corresponding
to separate contributions from atomic states of a speciﬁed orbital symmetry (viz., the
scaled hydrogen-like 1s, 2s and 2pz orbitals) under consideration:

Φ(1s2s2p)3σg (r; R0) = A1sΦ(1s)3σg (r; R0) + A2sΦ(2s)3σg (r; R0) + A2pΦ(2p)3σg (r; R0)

3. DISCUSSION.

Fig.1 demonstrates the angular dependence of molecular wavefunction (4) in mo-
mentum space presented for diﬀerent 3σg compositions, either with or without taking
a comparable contribution from atomic s-states into account. Let’s note ﬁrst that the
angular dependence corresponding to contribution from 2pz states alone (Fig.1a) is con-
siderably prolate along the internuclear axis since the 2pz states are predominantly ionized
along the internuclear axis owing to the presence of the geometrical factor cos θp in Eq.(5)
(cf. also with Eq.(20) and respective Fig.1a in [5]). This, particularly, illustrates that
the spatial (gerade or ungerade) symmetry of respective (2p) 3σg MO doesn’t essentially
aﬀect the angular dependence (viz., nodal plane along the molecular axis) in momen-
tum space. Thus, irrespectively of the sign in the combination of 2pz atomic states, the
respective (2p) 3σg MO suggests a predominant photoelectron emission along the inter-
nuclear axis in momentum space. The sign in the combination mostly alters the absolute
value of local maxima in respective angular dependence due to diﬀerent (sine or cosine)
trigonometric factor arising from intramolecular interference of contributions of ionization
R0) /2] factor in Eq.(5)
from two separate atomic centers [1]. In particular, the sin [(pN ·
” sign results in destructive intramolecular interference and a
corresponding to the ”

−

3

suppressed molecular ionization (e.g. in O2 molecule relative to Xe atom, see also [1, 2,
5], for details).

−

Accordingly, if the currently used ”

” combination of 2pz states is supposed to con-
tribute to the 3σg MO, then a coherent contribution from other (1s and/or 2s) atomic
states should be also taken into equally detailed consideration as described by Eq.(4). The
respective Figures 1c-1d (versus Fig.1a) demonstrate that the contribution from s-states
to the (1s2p) 3σg and (1s2s2p) 3σg MO dominates in momentum space at low photoelec-
tron momenta, in a qualitative accordance with stated in the Comment. Unfortunately,
the Reply’s restrictions don’t allow us to provide the reader with an extensive and suf-
ﬁciently detailed information about the respective molecular ionization rates, it will be
given elsewhere in our further related publications. So far we only have to stress that
the corresponding relative (weight) coeﬃcients Aj at 1s, 2s and 2pz states under con-
sideration proved to have comparable values, although not necessarily of the same sign.
Namely, the 3σg compositions with A1s and A2p (as well as A1s and A2s) of opposite signs
only proved to provide no suppression observed in experiment [10, 11] for N2 ionization as
compared to ionization of counterpart atomic Ar of nearly identical ionization potential
I (Ar)
15.75 eV . In particular , the total ionization rates calculated for A1s and A2p of
p ≈
opposite signs in (1s2p) 3σg and (1s2s2p) 3σg MO proved to demonstrate no suppression
(and even some enhancement) in N2 ionization relative to Ar well consistent with rele-
vant experiment [10, 11]. Our Figs.1c-1d also suggest that (1s2p) 3σg and (1s2s2p) 3σg
MO corresponding to the coeﬃcients A1s and A2p of opposite signs are always noticeably
prolate in momentum space along the internuclear axis, although to a considerably less
extent as compared to the (2p)3σg composed of pure 2pz states alone.

Anyhow, our Figs.1c-1d clearly illustrate that a more accurate consideration doesn’t
necessarily result in the 3σg HOMO to predominate in momentum space along the di-
rection perpendicular to the internuclear axis (as suggested, e.g., by Fig.4e of the ﬁrst
reference in [3] and/or Fig.1f in the Comment [4]). Since the generalized Bessel function
are commonly maximized when photoelectron momentum p is parallel to the laser ﬁeld
polarization e, the ionization from (1s2p) 3σg and (1s2s2p) 3σg presented in our Fig.1 is
expected to be predominant when the N2 molecular axis is aligned along the laser ﬁeld
e). This diﬀerence thus invalidates the Comment’s statement that incorrect (viz.,
(R0||
inconsistent with experiment) orientation dependence of N2 ionization rate the authors
also found in [3] is just explained by the VG version of molecular SFA they applied.
Our Fig.2 well illustrates the above conclusion and displays the orientation dependence
of total N2 ionization rates (see Eq.(13) in [5]) corresponding to diﬀerent 3σg composi-
tions. As expected, the compositions of 3σg HOMO taking a comparable contribution
from p-states into account always suggest a predominant ionization of N2 for parallel
orientation of internuclear axis relative to the laser ﬁeld polarization. Whereas, the com-
position of 3σg accounting for a contribution from pure s-states alone is well seen to only
give a predominant ionization of N2 for perpendicular orientation of internuclear axis as
suggested in the Comment. Such a behavior may thus arise only due to the contribut-
ing 1s or 2s states, which are spherically symmetric and equally well ionized along any
spatial direction. Therefore, the form of respective nodal plane relative to the molecu-
lar axis suggested by Eqs.(6) and (7) is solely determined by the cosine trigonometric

4

R0) /2], which alone suggests the angular dependence to be oblate along
factor cos [(pN ·
the internuclear axis in momentum space (Fig.1b). The resulting orientation dependence
with maximum ionization for the perpendicular orientation of molecular axis is thus quite
naturally expected for ionization of H2 and H +
2 (with a single (1s) 1σg MO composed of
pure s-states). For H2, such orientation dependence was recently revealed [12] using a
tunnelling model with a Heitler-London type valence bond wavefunction.

To summarize, our argumentation based on a more accurate consideration of 3σg
HOMO (4) is also qualitatively well consistent with alternative calculation [2] using the
same VG-SFA approach as applied by the Comment’s authors [3, 4]. Meantime, we also
have to stress that opposite orientation dependence of N2 ionization presented in Fig.2
of the Comment [4] is based on the same numerical HF-based procedure of 3σg HOMO
composition as applied in [2] under precisely the same situation (cf. with respective
Fig.7b in [2]). Therefore, we believe that orientation dependence of N2 ionization rate
presented in our Fig.2 is correct and its consistence with relevant experiment [9] not
just an accidental. By means of direct comparison of our Fig.1c (and/or Fig.1d) with
respective Fig.4e presented in [3], one can identify that opposite behavior of N2 ionization
suggested in [4] (as well as earlier in [3]) stems from a diﬀerent angular dependence of
3σg molecular state in momentum space. Our Fig.1 also suggests that such diﬀerence
may only arise owing to relative contribution from s-states, which seems to be somehow
overestimated (compared to p-states) within the particular (12s7p)/[6s4p] basis chosen in
the Comment for numerical HF-based procedure of 3σg composition in coordinate space.
This, particularly, becomes especially evident from Fig.3 displaying the correct orbital
shape for the 3σg wavefunction in coordinate space presented in Ref.[13] (see Fig.12
therein), which obviously diﬀers by a remarkably prominent domination of p-states from
the resulting 3σg state of substantially diﬀerent shape and detailed structure suggested
in [4] (cf. respective Fig.1c therein). Meantime, the numerical procedure applied in [3,
4] for 3σg composition doesn’t seem to be suﬃciently transparent with respect to the
extent of such relative contribution, which is thus hardly amenable to reliable analysis
and/or available for direct comparison [14]. Note also that a composition overestimating
the relative contribution from s-states in coordinate space is not suitable to 3σg state in
N2, which is known to have a diﬀerent and more complex structure well dominated by
p-states [15, 16].

Finally, we also have to clarify the main message of a diﬀerent (although, somewhat
related) research [17] the Comment’s authors quite inappropriately and very ambiguously
invoked in support of their related statement suggesting the LG version to be superior to
the VG version of the SFA under discussion. Recall that the cited similar conclusion of
Ref.[17] (see also Fig.1 therein to make certain) applies solely to ionization of atomic states
of only odd spatial parity, such as p-states, which are not symmetric with respect to the
inversion of all electron coordinates to opposite direction. Whereas, for the molecular 3σg
state (which is known as surely gerade, i.e. of even spatial parity), the VG and LG versions
of SFA, according to [17], are expected to give the same results, contrary to respective
VG-SFA ﬁndings of Ref.[3] and the context of main related statement of the Comment [4].

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS.

5

The criticism of the Comment [4] related to our previous imperfect composition of
the 3σg molecular wavefunction [5] was assessed to be physically correct as such, however
not aﬀecting essentially our related ﬁnal results and conclusions based on the velocity
gauge (VG) version of molecular strong-ﬁeld approximation (SFA). In particular, when
applying an appropriately modiﬁed 3σg wavefunction, we demonstrate that orientation
dependence of N2 ionization is to be correct (viz., consistent with experiment) and thus
the Comment’s critique cannot be accepted as an irrefutable argument and indispensable
evidence in support of the authors’ opposite respective VG-SFA ﬁndings [3, 4]. This,
particularly, invalidates the Comment’s main statement about unavailability of the SFA
in its VG formulation for adequate description of molecular strong-ﬁeld ionization when
an accurate molecular orbital is applied. Our conclusion is also well consistent with re-
cent Erratum [18] suggesting in fact analogous corrections to analytical expressions for
molecular ionization rate previously numerically calculated in [1, 2] for diatomic molecule
having a HOMO of gerade symmetry. Those corrections were also conﬁrmed in [18] as not
aﬀecting their correct ﬁnal results and conclusions discussed elsewhere earlier including
the interference suppression of molecular ionization and orientation dependence of N2
ionization [1, 2], which proved to be quite opposite to respective VG-SFA result of the
Comment applying the same approach and pure numerical HF-based procedure of 3σg
composition.

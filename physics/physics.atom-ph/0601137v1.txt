Abstract. We apply the convergent close-coupling (CCC) formalism to the problem
of two-photon double ionization of helium. The electron-photon interaction is treated
perturbatively whereas the electron-electron interaction is included in full. The
integrated two-photon double ionization cross-section is substantially below non-
perturbative literature results. However, the pattern of the angular correlation in the
two-electron continuum is remarkably close to the non-perturbative time-dependent
close-coupling calculation of Hu et al [J. Phys. B38, L35 (2005)]

1. Introduction

One-photon double ionization of He has been a subject of intense theoretical and
experimental studies over the past decade. As a result, a complete understanding of
this reaction has emerged both in terms of underlying physical processes and the precise
knowledge of magnitudes and shapes of the cross-sections over a wide range of photon
energies (Briggs & Schmidt 2000, King & Avaldi 2000, Avaldi & Huetz 2005).

Two-photon double ionization (TPDI) of He represents a new level of complexity
and brings new challenges, both to theory and experiment. Extremely intense VUV
radiation is needed to study TPDI of He. Only very recently, such a radiation has become
available from the free-electron laser sources (Laarmann et al 2005) and high harmonics
generation (Nabekawa et al 2005). Dynamics of the TPDI is richer as compared to
one-photon double ionization because of interplay of the S and D continua. Also, the
target description becomes more involving since the knowledge of the intermediate state
as well as the initial and the ﬁnal states is needed. More importantly, the target states
can be modiﬁed by the strong laser ﬁeld.

There have been several reported calculations of the total TPDI cross-section of He
at various photon energies (Pindzola & Robicheaux 1998, Nikolopoulos & Lambropoulos
2001, Parker et al 2001, Mercouris et al 2001, Colgan & Pindzola 2002, Feng & van der
Hart 2003, Piraux et al 2003, Hu et al 2005). Although numerical values of the cross-
sections vary depending on the theoretical model and assumed characteristics of the
laser ﬁeld, there is some consensus between several calculations (see Hu et al (2005)
for detail). It has also been well established that a non-perturbative treatment of the
electron-photon interaction is needed to obtain accurate total cross-sections.

As compared to the total cross-section, the present knowledge of the diﬀerential
cross-sections of the TPDI of He is limited. Only time-dependent close-coupling (TDCC)
calculations have been reported at photon energies close to double ionization threshold
(Colgan & Pindzola 2002, Hu et al 2005). In the meantime, the fully-resolved triple-
diﬀerential cross-section (TDCS) contains the most detailed information on the two-
electron break-up process.
In the case of one-photon double ionization, the analysis
of the TDCS brought a wealth of information allowing to clearly separate various
mechanisms of photo double ionization (Briggs & Schmidt 2000, Knapp et al 2002)

So there is a compelling motivation to perform further studies of He TPDI TDCS
at a wide photon energy range. To serve this purpose, we apply the convergent close-
coupling (CCC) formalism to describe the two-electron continuum following the TPDI
of He. This method has been extensively used to study one-photon double ionization
(Kheifets & Bray 1996, Kheifets & Bray 1998a, Kheifets & Bray 1998b). In the two-
photon case, a further development of the method is needed. Firstly, integration over all
the intermediate states of the target is required following absorption of a single photon.
This involves evaluation of the ill-deﬁned continuum-continuum dipole matrix elements.
To circumvent this diﬃculty, we perform our calculations in the Kramers-Henneberger
gauge of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (Ivanov & Kheifets 2005b). As an alternative and

Two-photon double ionization of helium

much less time consuming method, we use the closure approximation to carry out
summation over all the intermediate target states. As the result of this procedure,
we end up with evaluation of the monopole and quadrupole matrix elements between
the correlated ground state and the CCC ﬁnal state. This procedure has been worked
out in an earlier paper on the second Born treatment of the electron impact ionization-
excitation and double ionization of He (Kheifets 2004).

Secondly, as compared to the weak-ﬁeld single-photon double ionization, the
theoretical description of TPDI requires an account of the ﬁeld modiﬁcation of the target
states. Conceptually, this procedure has been developed in a way which can incorporate
the CCC formalism (Ivanov & Kheifets 2005a). However, at the present stage, we are
unable to perform fully converged numerically accurate calculations of this type due
to limitations of computer power. Leaving this task for the future, we report in the
present paper the CCC calculations of the He TPDI TDCS in the perturbative regime
when interaction of the target and the electromagnetic ﬁeld is treated to the second
order of the perturbation theory. Although this type of calculation would be clearly
inadequate to obtain accurate total TPDI cross-sections, it can be useful in evaluating
the angular correlation pattern in the two-electron continuum.
In this respect, the
present model is somewhat analogous to the asymptotic Coulomb treatment of the one-
photon double ionization (Schwarzkopf et al 1994, Maulbetsch & Briggs 1993). The
asymptotic three-body Coulomb (3C) wave function is only correct at large distances
from the nucleus. The fact that calculations with this wave function reproduce correctly
the angular correlation pattern in the two-electron continuum tells us that it is the
large distances which are responsible for forming this pattern. In the meantime, the
magnitude of the double photoionization cross-sections calculated with the 3C wave
function is typically oﬀ by a signiﬁcant factor which means that the photoelectron ﬂux
originates from vicinity of the nucleus where the 3C wave function is incorrect. The same
beneﬁts and disadvantages of such an approximate model can be seen in the present
work. Indeed, the fact that the angular correlation pattern of the two-photon double
ionization can be calculated correctly within a lowest order of the perturbation theory
tells us that it is the inter-electron correlation in the ﬁnal state that is responsible for
forming this pattern. In the meantime, the total cross-section which is incorrect in such
a perturbative calculation is sensitive to the detail of the electromagnetic interaction
and requires a fully non-perturbative treatment.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we give an outline of the formalism. In
Sec. 3 we give our numerical results which are obtained both with the CCC integration
over the intermediate target states and the closure approximation. Subsections 3.1,
3.2, 3.3 contain the analysis of the integrated and diﬀerential cross-sections and the
symmetrized ionization amplitudes, respectively. We conclude in Sec. 4 by outlining
our future directions in this project.

Expression (6) contains the dipole matrix elements between two continuum
states. This matrix elements are ill-deﬁned in the length and velocity gauges of the
electromagnetic interaction. To deal with these integrals, we use the so-called Kramers-
Henneberger form of the Hamiltonian describing interaction of the atom and the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. The matrix elements of the electromagnetic interaction operator
in this representation can be written as (Ivanov & Kheifets 2005b):
p 1
π

Z0
where a stands for a set of quantum numbers
We employ here the notation
describing the atom and m denotes a number of laser photons in a given mode. As can
be seen, matrix elements deﬁned by the Equation (7) are ﬁnite and well-deﬁned even if
both a and b are continuum atomic states. In Eq.(7) F is the classical ﬁeld strength.
It is a vector directed along the polarization vector of light, its magnitude is related to
the photon density as F 2/8π = nω. Both matrix elements in Equation (1) correspond
to the dipole transitions with p = 1. For such a dipole transitions, in the weak ﬁeld
limit F
0, operator (7) coincides, with the dipole operator in the acceleration gauge
Zri/r3
i . In addition, operator (7) can connect directly the initial and the ﬁnal states in
Equation (1) by simultaneous absorption of two photons (p = 2). Both sequential and
simultaneous absorption processes are of the same order and should be included in the
second order perturbation theory. See (Ivanov & Kheifets 2005b) for detail.

If we assume that the integrand in Equation (5) is a smooth function, we can take
out an average energy denominator and use the completeness of the CCC basis. This
procedure, known as the closure approximation, will take us to the following result:

By integrating TDCS (3) over the angles Ω1, Ω2 one gets the single diﬀerential, with

Implicit in the above is that E1 + E2 = E0 + 2ω with E2 = ǫn2l2 for some pseudostate

one value of E2 (Bray & Fursa 1995).

In this expression, the energy of the pseudostate and the Coulomb wave are bound by
the energy conservation ǫf + k2/2 = 2ω + E0. When evaluating expressions (9) and
(10), we can assume that the largest contribution to the sum over the intermediate
states in (5) comes from those terms in which the energy of the continuum electron
in the intermediate state is of the order of the energy of the ejected photoelectron

Although expression (3) has been derived in the second-order perturbation theory,
its tensorial structure is general
for the TPDI. It allows to introduce a simple
parametrization of the TDCS in the manner suggested for the one-photon double
ionization by Huetz and co-workers (Huetz et al 1991, Malegat, Selles & Huetz 1997,
Malegat, Selles, Lablanquie, Mazeau & Huetz 1997). We proceed as follows. We rewrite

So, in case of an arbitrary energy sharing, the theoretical description of the TPDI TDCS
requires ﬁve amplitudes as compared with only two amplitudes needed to describe the
one-photon double ionization TDCS. This reﬂects a much richer dynamical structure of
the two-electron continuum

3. Numerical results

3.1. Integrated cross-sections

We start presenting our numerical results with the total integrated cross-section (TICS)
of the TPDI of He. On the left panel of Figure 1 we show the TPDI TICS from several
closure calculations at various photon energies in comparison with the literature values.
As is seen from the ﬁgure, the presently calculated cross-section falls substantially below
predictions of other methods. We cannot say whether this is a shortcoming of the
closure approximation or the second-order perturbation theory in general. The full
CCC calculation of the total cross-section is too much time consuming to get the data
across a wide photon energy range.

Figure 1. Left panel: Total cross-section of the TPDI on He as a function of the photon
energy ω. Present CCC closure calculation is compared with the TD-calculation of
Piraux et al (2003), R-matrix calculation of Feng & van der Hart (2003) and Grid
calculation of Hu et al (2005). Central panel: Single diﬀerential cross-section of the
TPDI of He at ω = 45 eV. The extrapolated CCC SDCS at equal energy sharing is
shown by an open circle. The TDCC results are from Colgan & Pindzola (2002). Right
panel: Single diﬀerential cross-section of the single-photon double ionization of He at
the same excess energy. A “raw” and extrapolated CCC calculations are shown by the
red solid and purple dashed lines, respectively.

Evaluation of the magnitude of the TDCS requires the knowledge of the single-
diﬀerential cross-section (SDCS) resolved with respect to the photoelectron energy. As
was shown in the case of the single-photon double ionization, the “raw” SDCS, as

Two-photon double ionization of helium

calculated by the CCC method, is oscillatory due to explicit distinguishability of the two
photoelectrons. A special extrapolation procedure was devised to cure these unphysical
oscillations which relied on the fact that the area beneath the SDCS is the total cross-
section and the equal energy SDCS should be given by the coherent sum of the direct and
exchange CCC amplitudes (Kheifets & Bray 2002). The raw TPDI SDCS from the CCC
closure calculation at ω = 45 eV is shown in the central panel of Figure 1 in comparison
with the TDCC calculation of Hu et al (2005). The full extrapolation procedure was not
implemented in the case of TPDI except for the midpoint which was calculated with the
coherent sum of the direct and exchange amplitudes. For comparison, in the right panel
of Figure 1 we show the SDCS of the single-photon double ionization of He at the same
excess energy. Both the raw and extrapolated calculations are shown which resemble
respectively the CCC and TDCC TPDI results on the central panel of Figure 1.

3.2. Triple diﬀerential cross-sections

The full CCC calculation of the TDCS TPDI based on Eqs. (3) and (5) is very time
consuming. So far, we were able to perform just one such calculation at the photon
energy of 45 eV and equal energy sharing of the two photoelectrons E1 = E2 = 5.5 eV.
The resulting TDCS are shown in Figure 2 in comparison with the TDCC calculation
of Colgan & Pindzola (2002). Here the coplanar geometry is assumed with one electron
escaping at a ﬁxed angle θ1 and the second electron detected on the full angular range.
l target states with orbital momentum l
The CCC basis of the ﬁnal state included 17
ranging from 0 to 4 (the so-called 17l4 calculation). The CCC basis of the intermediate
states was much shorter with only three target states (1s, 2s, 2p) included. This was
possible because the absorption of a single 45 eV photon could populate only few target
states.

As it will be shown in the subsequent analysis, the TDCS is dominated by the
D-wave except for the special case of the ﬁxed electron angle θ1 = 90◦. In this case
a very small TDCS is a result of a delicate compensation of the D and S-waves. The
CCC calculation reproduces the TDCC calculation of Colgan & Pindzola (2002) fairly

Two-photon double ionization of helium

well except for this special case when the D wave remains uncompensated and produces
a very large peak.

The closure approximation (8) makes a considerable simpliﬁcation of the calculation
and a much larger basis of the ﬁnal target states can be handled with the present
computational resources. In Figure 2 we show the results of a 20l5 closure calculation
at the same photon energy ω = 45 eV and E1 = E2 = 5.5 eV. At θ1 = 0◦, both the full
CCC calculation and the closure calculation perform fairly well, the closure calculation
resulting in a somewhat lesser “wings” on the sides of the main peak. At θ1 = 30◦
and especially at θ1 = 60◦, the full CCC calculation reproduces better a second peak
270◦. In the most diﬃcult case of θ1 = 90◦, both calculations
appearing at around θ2 ≃
270◦ which is not visible in the TDCC calculation.
produce a large spurious peak at θ2 ≃
As will be discussed in the following, this peak is a result of an undercompensated D
wave. Generally, the closure approximation results are quite close to the full CCC
calculation. In the rest of the paper, we will focus on the closure approximation which
is much less computationally demanding.

various ﬁxed angles θ1. As is seen in the ﬁgure, the D-wave contribution is dominant
for all ﬁxed electron angles except for θ1 = 90◦. Here a very small cross-section of Hu
et al (2005) is result of an almost complete compensation of the partial S- and D-wave
contributions. The present CCC closure calculation deviate insigniﬁcantly from Hu et al
(2005) but no such a perfect compensation of the partial waves occurs. As the result,
the TDCS at θ1 = 90◦ is quite diﬀerent from the TDCC calculation.

Figure 4. TDCS TPDI of He for the coplanar geometry at ω = 46 eV and various
energy sharings. A 20l5 closure calculation (red solid line) is compared with the TDCC
calculation of Hu et al (2005) (black thick solid line). In all panels, the ﬁxed electron
angle is θ1 = 30◦.

More data is presented in Figure 4 where we show the TDCS at the photon energy
ω = 46 eV and various, both equal and unequal, energy sharings. Here the ﬁxed
electron angle is kept constant at θ1 = 30◦. Generally, a good agreement with the
TDCC calculation of Hu et al (2005) is seen with some minor shape variations. This
has been the case previously as at this particular value of the ﬁxed electron angle the
main contribution to the TDCS comes from the D-wave and no signiﬁcant interference
between the partial waves occurs.

As it was pointed out when discussing the SDCS calculations, the equal energy
sharing TDCS can be calculated fully ab initio in the CCC method by constructing
the coherent sum of the direct and exchange ionization amplitudes. Therefore, all the
TDCS shown in Figs. 2-3 are absolute. When making comparison with the TDCC
results, only one scaling constant was used across all the panels of these ﬁgures to
account for somewhat diﬀerent total integrated cross-sections in the two methods. For
the asymmetric energy sharing, however, the magnitude of the CCC TDCS can be
aﬀected by the SDCS oscillations. Therefore, the CCC results in Figure 4 were scaled
individually on the side and central panels to make a shape comparison with the TDCC
data of Hu et al (2005).

3.3. TPDI amplitudes

The TDCS presented in the preceding section can be most conveniently analyzed using
parametrization (20) with the symmetrized amplitudes deﬁned by Equation (19). In
the case of equal energy sharing, only three quadrupole amplitudes and one monopole
amplitude are needed. The moduli squared of these amplitudes are shown in Figure 5
for ω = 45 eV and E1 = E2 = 5.5 eV.

Figure 5. Symmetrized amplitudes g+, gs, g0 and f0 as functions of the mutual

As in the case of the single-photon double ionization, all the amplitudes peaks
strongly at θ12 = 180◦. This is a result of the strong electron repulsion favoring back-
to-back emission. The central part of the amplitudes around θ12 = 180◦ was ﬁtted with
the Gaussian on a ﬂat pedestal:

The ﬁtting seems to be nearly perfect with the width parameters ∆θ12 of 110◦, 131◦,
63◦ and 105◦ for g+, gs, g0 and f0, respectively. For comparison, at the present
energy sharing, the symmetric amplitude of the single-photon double ionization has
the Gaussian width of 96◦, somewhat less than that of g+.

Gaussian ansatz (22) combined with Equation (20) allows to analyze the evolution
of the TPDI TDCS as a function of the ﬁxed photoelectron angle. At θ1 = 0, θ12 = θ2
and

We see that the kinematic factors accompanying the largest amplitudes g+ and gs both
peak at θ2 = 180◦ where the amplitudes have the maximum. This produces a bold
peak seen in all TDCS ﬁgures at this combination of angles θ1 and θ2. This is in sharp
contrast to one-photon double ionization in which the kinematic factor is represented
by P1(cos θ1) + P1(cos θ2) which has a node at θ12 = 180◦. As a result, the one-photon
TDCS has a maximum at a compromise angle where neither the kinematic factor nor
the amplitude have their respective maxima.

The shape of the TPDI TDCS changes completely at θ1 = 90◦ where

Neither of the factors peak at 180◦ and the D-wave contribution has the maximum at
a compromise angle of 270◦. A partial overlap between the kinematic and dynamic
factors result in a much smaller cross-section. Coincidentally, the S-wave has the peak
at θ2 = 270◦ as well. However, the relative phase of the S and D amplitudes conspires
to cancel out the two contributions. This cancellation is a dynamic property depending

Two-photon double ionization of helium

on the relative magnitude of the quadrupole and monopole amplitudes. It is somewhat
diﬀerent in the CCC and TDCC calculations which assume diﬀerent models of the two-
electron dynamics.

In Figure 6 we analyze the TPDI amplitudes much further away from the double
ionization threshold at the equal energy sharing of E1 = E2 = 20 eV. All the amplitudes
were ﬁtted with the Gaussian ansatz. The width parameters are 94◦, 131◦, 90◦ and 90◦
for g+, gs, g0 and f0 respectively. There is no systematic change of the Gaussian width
parameters at 40 eV as compared to 4 eV excess energy. In the meantime, the Gaussian
width of the single-photon ionization amplitude has increased from 96◦ to 103◦.

Qualitative similarity of the amplitudes in Figure 5 and Figure 6 allows us to predict
that the basic shape of the TDCS will remain unchanged much further away from the
double ionization threshold compared to what was investigated by Hu et al (2005).
To make more quantitative predictions for the TDCS a more systematic study of the
amplitudes is needed including a thorough test of convergence with respect to the size
of the CCC basis.

4. Conclusion

In the present paper we investigated the two-photon double ionization of He in a
wide range of photon energies from 4 to 40 eV above the threshold. The electron-
photon interaction was treated to the lowest second order whereas the electron-electron
interaction was included non-perturbatively. We applied the convergent close-coupling
formalism to describe the S- and D two-electron continua of the ﬁnal doubly ionized
state. The intermediate P -state was also described with the CCC expansion, albeit of
a smaller size. The ill-deﬁned continuum-continuum dipole matrix elements between
the intermediate and ﬁnal states were handled using the Kramers-Henneberger gauge
of the electromagnetic interaction. As an alternative and much less computationally
extensive solution, we used the closure approximation summing over the complete set
of the intermediate states. By doing so, we were able to reduce the TPDI amplitude
to the matrix element of the squared dipole operator, in the length gauge, between the
correlated ground state and the two-electron CCC ﬁnal state.

Near the threshold, the presently calculated total integrated TPDI cross-section is of
the same order of magnitude as predicted by other non-perturbative methods. However,

Two-photon double ionization of helium

14

further away from the threshold, the CCC closure results fall substantially below the
reported literature values. The single diﬀerential, with respect to the energy, cross-
section was also evaluated. As in the single-photon double ionization, the raw CCC
SDCS shows unphysical oscillations and needs rescaling. However, the equal energy
sharing point can still be calculated ab initio.

The fully-resolved triple diﬀerential cross-sections were evaluated using integration
over the complete set of CCC intermediate state as well as the closure approximation.
Both sets of results agree reasonably well with the previously reported TDCC cross-
sections. The only exception is the ﬁxed electron angle of 90◦ where the delicate
cancellation of the S- and D-partial waves takes place. Here the CCC and TDCSS
results are at variance. These ﬁndings indicate that the angular correlation pattern in
TPDI is formed mainly due to the inter-electron interaction in the two-electron continua.
Inﬂuence of the strong laser ﬁeld and precise mechanisms of the two-photon absorption is
less important. Of course, this conclusion needs to be further conﬁrmed experimentally.
A complete set of symmetrized amplitudes was introduced to parametrize
conveniently the TPDI TDCS. The amplitudes display a Gaussian shape and allow
to explain the evolution of the TDCS at varying ﬁxed electron angles. The amplitudes
evaluated at fairly high excess energy of 40 eV resemble closely the amplitudes near
threshold. This allows to predict a rather robust shape of the TPDI TDCS across a
wide range of photon energies. Reported Gaussian parameters can be useful in modeling
the TPDI TDCS at various experimental kinematics. A more systematic and consistent
study is required, and is planned, to serve this purpose. Numerical values reported
here serve only as an illustration and should be treated as preliminary because not all
the convergence checks were possible to perform at the present stage. Therefore, some
minor variation in the width parameters might occur as the size of the CCC basis varies.
This work is the ﬁrst report on the application of the CCC method to the TPDI
process in He. We intend to continue this work, both within the scope of the perturbation
theory and treating the electromagnetic ﬁeld non-perturbatively. The basic framework
of the theory is outlined in our earlier paper (Ivanov & Kheifets 2005a). The theory
is potentially capable of studying a wide range of photon energies and electromagnetic
ﬁeld intensities. The only limitation is available computational resources which we hope
to lift in the near future.

The ionization of a one-dimensional model Helium atom in short laser pulses using time-dependent
density functional theory is investigated. We calculate ionization probabilities as a function of laser
intensity by approximating the correlation function of the system adiabatically with an explicit
dependence on the fractional number of bound electrons. For the correlation potential we take the
derivative discontinuity at integer numbers of bound electrons explicitly into account. This approach
reproduces ionization probabilities from the solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation,
in particular the so-called “knee” due to nonsequential ionization.

PACS numbers: 31.15.Ew, 32.80.Rm

Experimental double ionization yields for Helium
atoms in laser ﬁelds of λ = 614 nm [1] and λ = 780 nm [2]
show a “knee”- structure as a function of intensity, i.e.,
double ionization is enhanced over the expected yields
for sequential ionization by several orders of magnitude
and was therefore named nonsequential double ionization
(NSDI).

Theoretically, the problem was addressed successfully
using the strong-ﬁeld approximation (see, e.g., [3, 4] and
references therein) and classical methods [5, 6]. The
widely accepted mechanism behind NSDI relies on the
rescattering of the ﬁrst electron with its parent ion, col-
lisionally ionizing (or exciting) the second electron.

However, investigations using time-dependent density
functional theory (TDDFT) [7] failed to reproduce the
characteristic “knee” of the double ionization proba-
bility [8, 9, 10]. This failure is especially important
given the fact that TDDFT oﬀers the possibility to treat
the strong-ﬁeld dynamics of atomic and molecular sys-
tems from ﬁrst principles in a numerically tractable way,
whereas the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation in full
dimensionality [11] is limited to two active electrons.
Other methods used to tackle the NSDI problem from
ﬁrst principles are R-Matrix Floquet theory [12] or multi-
conﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock [13, 14, 15],
which, however, have not yet reproduced NSDI-”knees”
either.

Two reasons for the failure of TDDFT in the context
of NSDI were identiﬁed [16]: The approximation of the
exchange-correlation functional vxc and the approxima-
tion of the functionals for the calculation of the ionization
Initial attempts to overcome these prob-
probabilities.
lems were not successful [16]. Recent progress in ap-
proximating vxc has been made by including an explicit
dependence on the number of bound electrons [17, 18].
In this work we therefore focus our attention on the open
problem of constructing functionals for the calculation of
the ionization probabilities. We show that by using a
rather simple adiabatic approximation of the correlation
function, the ionization yields for a model He-atom in

few-cycle laser pulses (for which we have the exact time-
dependent Schr¨odinger solutions at hand) are remarkably
well reproduced.

We investigate Helium in linearly polarized N -cycle

mental work [1, 2] are chosen: ω = 0.058 (N = 3, 4) and
ω = 0.074 (N = 3) (atomic units are used throughout
this work unless otherwise indicated). The linear polar-
ization of the laser pulses allows to model Helium by a
one-dimensional atom with soft-core potentials for the
Coulomb interactions. It is known that the essential fea-
tures of the nonsequential double ionization process are
described well by this model [8, 9, 13, 17, 18, 19]. For

probability to ﬁnd at time t an electron at x2 in dx2
if there is an electron at x1. Since the probability is an
observable, the Runge-Gross theorem [7] assures that the

as a functional of the density [16].

The functional dependence of gc on n is not known
and the calculation of the pair density ρ at time t = T is
computationally demanding even for the one-dimensional
Helium model atom. Therefore, it is necessary to ﬁnd
a suitable approximation for gc [n] (x1, x2, T ) to calcu-
late Ic. Setting Ic (t) = 0 corresponds to assuming the

two-electron wavefunction to be a product of identical
single-electron orbitals. This interpretation of the Kohn-
Sham orbitals as electron orbitals has been widely used
[8, 9, 16, 17]. However, this approach leads to ioniza-
tion probabilities which diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the exact
probabilities even when the exact density (5) is used [9],
as shown in Fig. 1. The LK05 approximation for vxc leads

to probabilities which closely resemble the probabilities
calculated from the exact densities.

The TDSE solution yields the exact pair density (4)
and density (5). This allows us to calculate the exact
gc and Ic as a reference for approximations of gc. Fig-
ure 2 reveals a structure in the two-electron space of the
integrand of Ic (T ) which is remarkably simple. This is
caused by the multiplication of gc by the density at x1
and at x2, which exhibits a maximum at the origin. For
the two other laser pulses the integrand of Ic reveals a
qualitatively similar structure. The values of Ic (T ) for

the three laser pulses are depicted in the left panel of
Fig. 3 as a function of the number of bound electrons
N (T ). Ic shows a quantitatively similar behavior for all
three laser pulses: a minimum value for Ic is reached
when the number of electrons is equal to one. This result
points to the importance of the quantity N (T ) for the
value of Ic (T ).

We shall now introduce our adiabatic approximation
for gc. The starting point is our assumption that the sys-
tem in the vicinity of the Helium core after the laser pulse
closely resembles a groundstate system with a fractional
number of electrons given by the number of bound elec-
trons N (T ). We approximate numerator and denomina-
tor of the correlation function separately as linear combi-
nations of the groundstate densities ni and groundstate
pair densities ρi of i-electron systems. The density of the
model Helium atom is expressed as [17]

where nA = nA (x, t), ni = ni (x) and N = N (t) is given
by (7). Since n (x) dx is the probability to ﬁnd an elec-
tron at x in dx, the density of the zero-electron system
vanishes: n0 = 0. Assuming the same adiabatic depen-
dence of ρA (t) on N (t) the pair density is approximated
as

where ρA = ρA (x1, x2, t), ρi = ρi (x1, x2) and N = N (t).
The pair density ρ (x1, x2) gives the joint probability to
ﬁnd an electron at x1 in dx1 and an electron at x2 in
dx2. Corresponding to our consideration for the density,
the pair densities of the zero- and one-electron systems
are zero: ρ0 = 0, ρ1 = 0. For our model atom, n1 (x)
is the groundstate density of He+. It is calculated from
the solution of the respective one-dimensional stationary
Schr¨odinger equation with ǫ = 0.5 chosen to reproduce the
ionization potential Ip = 2.0 of He+. Consistently we use
n2 (x) = n (x, t = 0) where n denotes the density utilized
to calculate N (t) in (7). Our adiabatic approximation of
gc thus is

tion probabilities of atoms in strong laser ﬁelds from
time-dependent density functional calculations, knowl-
edge of the correlation integral Ic (T ) is vital. For a
one-dimensional Helium model atom, an adiabatic ap-
proximation of the correlation function gc close to the
Helium core yields an approximation of Ic which agrees
qualitatively and quantitatively well with the exact Ic.
The exact single ionization probabilities and the “knee”-
structure in the double ionization probability are repro-
duced. The (pair) density of Helium after the laser pulse
can be approximated by a linear combination of atomic
and ionic groundstate (pair) densities and pair densities
using the fractional number of bound electrons. This
method opens the possibility to apply the adiabatic ap-
proximation in three dimensions and to the ionization of
more complex atoms.

correlation integral I A

λ = 780 nm, N = 3 cycle laser pulse.

Figure 4 shows the ionization probabilities calculated
from the exact and the LK05 densities using the approx-
imated I A
c (T ) for the λ = 780 nm, N = 3 laser pulse. Sin-
gle ionization probabilities agree very well with the exact
probabilities from the TDSE for both exact and LK05
densities. The systematically too low values for Ic = 0
are corrected. Double ionization probabilities show a
good agreement for high intensities. For low intensities
the double ionization probabilities (and I A
c ) are so small
that already small deviations of I A
c from the exact Ic lead
to relatively large deviations in the logarithmic plot of the
ionization probabilities and to minima and maxima in the
double ionization probability. For the three laser pulses
examined, the adiabatically corrected probabilities show
a minimum at intensities when the second derivative of
the exact probabilities changes its sign at the onset of the
“knee”-structure (where N (T )
1). Comparison with
the values for Ic = 0 (Fig. 1) evidences a signiﬁcant im-
provement of the TDDFT ionization probabilities using
our approximation of the correlation function (13).

Using the electron-hydrogen scattering Temkin-Poet
model we investigate the behavior of the cross sections for
excitation of all of the states used in the convergent close-
coupling (CCC) formalism. In the triplet channel, it is found
that the cross section for exciting the positive-energy states
is approximately zero near-threshold and remains so until a
further energy, equal to the energy of the state, is added to
the system. This is consistent with the step-function hypoth-
esis [Bray, Phys. Rev. Lett. 78 4721 (1997)] and inconsistent
with the expectations of Bencze and Chandler [Phys. Rev.
A 59 3129 (1999)]. Furthermore, we compare the results
of the CCC-calculated triplet and singlet single diﬀerential
cross sections with the recent benchmark results of Baertschy,
Rescigno and McCurdy [Phys. Rev. A (submitted)], and ﬁnd
consistent agreement.

In recent times the electron-impact ionization of atoms
has attracted considerable attention and controversy.
Whereas we would argue that the convergent close-
coupling (CCC) approach to the problem [1] has been
one of the most successful to date, Bencze and Chan-
dler [2] argue that there are fundamental ﬂaws in the
method and that the presented results are inconsistent
with the prediction of their derivation in the limit of in-
ﬁnite CCC basis sizes N . To be more precise, they ﬁrst
argue that their operator formalism shows that in the
limit of inﬁnite N the CCC formalism should converge
to the true ionization scattering amplitudes, which sat-
isfy the symmetrization postulate

fS(k, q) = (

1)SfS(q, k)

−

in the case of e-H ionization, where S = 0, 1 is the total
spin. Therefore, at any total (excess) energy E the re-
sulting singly diﬀerential cross sections (SDCS) should be
symmetric about E/2. The fact that the CCC-calculated
SDCS is not symmetric Bencze and Chandler interpret
as a lack of convergence of the calculations.

How can such a controversy be resolved? We are not
able to perform calculations with inﬁnite basis sizes. Fur-
thermore, we have already acknowledged that there are
convergence problems in the CCC formalism [3], but very
diﬀerent to those suggested by Bencze and Chandler.

Thus, the situation may appear to be somewhat con-
fused. The aim of this paper is to clarify the situation.
We have already given extensive arguments as to why we
completely refute the arguments of Bencze and Chan-
dler
[4]. Here we show that there are unphysical con-
sequences of their claims. Furthermore, to demonstrate
convergence, or lack of it, in the CCC method we com-
pare with the benchmark SDCS calculated by Baertschy,
Rescigno, and McCurdy [5] using the very recently devel-
oped external complex scaling (ECS) method. We shall
only consider the Temkin-Poet model e-H problem [6,7]
due to its simplicity (only states of zero orbital angular
momentum involved), and yet it is suﬃcient to address
all of the issues involved. Accordingly, we shall write
momenta as scalars.

n with energies ǫ(N )

In performing CCC calculations we ﬁrst obtain a set
of N states φ(N )
(n = 1, . . . , N ) by
diagonalising the target Hamiltonian in an orthogonal
Laguerre basis [8]. These are then used to approximate
the target space identity operator I2 by

and Chandler [2] are quite happy with this deﬁnition of
the ionization amplitude and claim that in the limit of
inﬁnite N it leads to the true scattering amplitudes that
must, therefore, satisfy the symmetrization relation (1).
In our view their derivation has not proved either claim
as the limiting procedure ignored what happens to the
close-coupling boundary conditions. These are crucial
to the deﬁnition of the close-coupling formalism in that
they allow for only one electron to escape to true inﬁnity
due to the L2 nature of φ(N )
. Extensive comparison with
experiment [1,9,10,11] has been our sole evidence to sug-
gest that thus-deﬁned amplitudes (for the full problem)
converge to the correct ionization amplitudes, but only
for q
k. Let us demonstrate this by comparison with
the recent SDCS benchmark data of Baertschy, Rescigno,
and McCurdy [5].

The CCC(N ) calculations have been performed for N =
21, . . . , 25. For the triplet channel all of the CCC cal-

culations lie on the smooth curve of the ECS-calculated
SDCS, but only for secondary energies less than E/2. At
higher energies the latter increases symmetrically about
E/2, whereas the CCC calculations all yield near-zero
cross sections. To our mind this is a very satisfactory
result. All of the physics is contained in the secondary
energy range [0, E/2]. Clearly, CCC has converged to the
correct result on this energy range, and no double count-
ing of the ionization cross section occurs even though the
integration endpoint in (9) is E.

Unfortunately, the singlet case is more complicated.
The unphysical oscillatory CCC-calculated SDCS has not
converged with increasing N , but oscillates about the
ECS-calculated SDCS on the [0, E/2] secondary energy
range. The ECS calculations show that the SDCS at
E/2 is substantial, unlike the triplet cases where it is
zero due the Pauli Principle. We believe that as N

→
the CCC(N )-calculated SDCS would converge to the
∞
step-function formed by the ECS SDCS on the secondary
energy range [0, E/2] and zero elsewhere. These results
are consistent with our earlier expectations [3].

Let us return to the criticism of Bencze and Chan-
dler. It is independent of total spin, and so they argue
that even our triplet results have not converged. Some-
how as N is increased to inﬁnity they expect the CCC-
calculated SDCS to converge to that calculated by the
ECS method. One consequence of this is that the uni-
tary CCC method will double-count the total ionization
cross section, since (9) always holds. Another interest-
ing consequence is found by considering what the CCC-
calculated SDCS at large secondary energies really mean.
n < E may
be excited. The cross sections in Fig. 1, at secondary
energies near E, correspond to near-threshold excitation
of these states. In other words, the shape of the CCC-
calculated SDCS from large to small secondary energies
shows the threshold onwards behavior of the cross section

true discrete energies and the continuum, respectively.

To demonstrate this explicitly we take a single N = 25
basis, whose energies are given in Fig. 2, and perform
CCC(25) calculations at very many total energies E. The
exponential fall-oﬀ parameter [8] is kept at λ = 1.0 in all
cases. This yields eight negative-energy states (lowest
six good eigenstates) and 17 positive-energy states. The
cross section for the excitation of states with n
3 has
been given before [13], and so we start with n = 4. In

particularly remarkable is observed. The cross sections

tude than the n = 7 owing to it attempting to take into
account n > 8 true discrete eigenstates.

increase. Instead, as we increase n further we see that
the cross section remains very small until approximately
an energy equal to ǫ(25)
above threshold. By the Pauli
Principle the true result is exactly zero at this point. The
CCC calculations give a very good approximation to this.

FIG. 3. Triplet cross sections for excitation of the speci-
ﬁed negative-energy states of the CCC(25) calculation in the
Temkin-Poet model.

What is more interesting is the behavior of the cross
sections for the excitation of positive-energy states, given
in Fig.4. Other than for a rise in magnitude the n = 9
and n = 13 (and those inbetween) cross sections are much
the same as the n = 8 cross sections. This is contrary to
the expectations of Bencze and Chandler, at least in the
limit of inﬁnite N . A symmetric SDCS could only be ob-
tained if the cross section for exciting the positive-energy
pseudostates was non-zero at threshold, diminished to
(in the present case) zero at E/2, and then began to

Thus, we found that the bigger the energy of the pseu-
dostate the more energy above threshold is required be-
fore the cross section for its excitation begins to rise.
This remarkable feature demonstrates the consistency of
our interpretation of the CCC-calculated ionization am-
plitudes. Whereas previously we have taken a particular
E and showed, by variation of N , the plausibility of the
step-function hypothesis [3] at that E. Here, we have
taken a single N and showed, by variation of E, the plau-
sibility of the step-function hypothesis at all E, at least
for the triplet channel.

3

For the singlet channel the situation is less clear due to
lack of convergence problems, see Fig. 5. Here the cross
sections rise rapidly after the arrow (indicating ǫ(25)
n )
and are relatively small at the lower total energies above
threshold. We suspect that for inﬁnite N these cross sec-
tions would be zero at energies smaller than the energy of
the state, and jump to be substantially nonzero at higher
energies.

may be restated as: cross sections for the excitation
of positive-energy ǫ(N )
pseudostates remain zero past
n
threshold (E = ǫ(N )
n ) until the total energy E is in ex-
cess of 2ǫ(N )
n . Note that this claim is applicable to all
implementations of the close-coupling method.

A consequence of the present study is that we are
still conﬁdent in the correctness of our interpretation of
the application of the CCC method to ionization pro-
cesses [3]. We are particularly pleased to see the ECS
theory being able to calculate accurately the true SDCS,
as these are necessary to rescale the CCC-calculated
angle-diﬀerential cross sections [3,14].

context the step-function in the SDCS hypothesis [3]

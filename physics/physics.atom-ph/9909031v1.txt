The ground and a few excited states of the carbon atom in external uniform magnetic

ﬁelds are calculated by means of our 2D mesh Hartree-Fock method for ﬁeld strengths
ranging from zero up to 2.35 · 109T. With increasing ﬁeld strength the ground state un-
dergoes six transitions involving seven diﬀerent electronic conﬁgurations which belong to

three groups with diﬀerent spin projections Sz = −1, −2, −3. For weak ﬁelds the ground
state conﬁguration arises from the ﬁeld-free 1s22s22p02p−1, Sz = −1 conﬁguration.
With increasing ﬁeld strength the ground state involves the four Sz = −2 conﬁgurations
1s22s2p02p−12p+1, 1s22s2p02p−13d−2, 1s22p02p−13d−24f−3 and 1s22p−13d−24f−35g−4,
followed by the two fully spin polarized Sz = −3 conﬁgurations 1s2p02p−13d−24f−35g−4

and 1s2p−13d−24f−35g−46h−5. The last conﬁguration forms the ground state of the

carbon atom in the high ﬁeld regime γ > 18.664. The above series of ground state con-

ﬁgurations is extracted from the results of numerical calculations for more than twenty

electronic conﬁgurations selected due to some general energetical arguments.

I. INTRODUCTION

The behaviour and properties of atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds is a subject of increasing interest. On
the one hand this is motivated by the astrophysical discovery of strong ﬁelds on white dwarfs and neutron
stars [1–3] and on the other hand the competition of the diamagnetic and Coulombic interaction causes

a rich variety of complex properties which are of interest on their own. The carbon atom, which is the
subject of the present investigation, plays a major role for the evolution of stars and is also expected to
occur in the case of magnetic white dwarfs and neutron stars.

Investigations on the electronic structure in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld appear to be quite compli-
cated due to the intricate geometry of this quantum problem. Most of the investigations in the literature
focused on the hydrogen atom (for a list of references see, for example, [4–7]). The results of these studies
provided us with an understanding of the absorption features of certain magnetic white dwarfs and al-
lowed for a modeling of their atmospheres (see ref. [8] for a comprehensive review up to 1994 and ref. [9]
for a more recent review on atoms and molecules in strong magnetic ﬁelds). On the other hand there is a

number of magnetic white dwarfs whose spectra remain unexplained and cannot be interpreted in terms
of magnetized atomic hydrogen. Furthermore new magnetic objects are discovered (see, for example,
Reimers et al [10] in the course of the Hamburg ESO survey) whose spectra await to be explained. The
most prominent of the unexplained magnetic objects is the white dwarf GD 229. Very recently signiﬁcant
progress has been achieved with respect to the interpretation of its rich spectrum ranging from the UV to
the near IR. Extensive and precise calculations on the helium atom provided data for many excited states
in a broad range of ﬁeld strengths [11]. The comparison of the stationary transitions of the atom with
the positions of the absorption edges of the observed spectrum yielded strong evidence for the existence

1

of helium in the atmosphere of GD229 [12].

For the hydrogen atom the impact of the competing Coulomb and diamagnetic interaction is partic-
ularly evident and pronounced in the intermediate regime for which the magnetic and Coulomb forces
are comparable. For diﬀerent electronic degrees of excitation of the atom the intermediate regime is met
for diﬀerent absolute values of the ﬁeld strength. For the ground state this regime is roughly given by
γ = 0.2 − 20 (γ = B/B0 is the magnetic ﬁeld strength in atomic units, B0 = ¯hc/ea2
0 = 2.3505·105T).
Both early [13] and more recent works [4,14–17] on the hydrogen atom have used diﬀerent approaches
for relatively weak ﬁelds (the Coulomb force prevails over the magnetic force) and for very strong ﬁelds
(the Coulomb force can be considered as weak in comparison with the magnetic forces which is the so-
called adiabatic regime). In the latter regime the motion of the electron parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld is
dominated [18] by a 1D quasi-Coulomb potential including a parameter which depends on the magnetic
ﬁeld strength. The detailed calculations of the hydrogen energy levels carried out by R¨osner et al [4] also
retained the separation into diﬀerent regimes of the ﬁeld strength by decomposing the electronic wave

function either in terms of spherical (weak to intermediate ﬁelds) or cylindrical (intermediate to high
ﬁelds) orbitals. A powerful method to obtain comprehensive results on low-lying energy levels of the
hydrogen atom in particular in the intermediate regime is provided by mesh methods [5].

For atoms with several electrons there are two decisive factors which enrich the possible changes in
the electronic structure with varying ﬁeld strength compared to the one-electron system. First we have a
third competing interaction which is the electron-electron repulsion and second the diﬀerent electrons feel
very diﬀerent Coulomb forces, i.e. possess diﬀerent one particle energies, and consequently the regime
of the intermediate ﬁeld strengths appears to be the sum of the intermediate regimes for the separate
electrons.

There exist a number of investigations on two-electron atoms in the literature [19–29]. The majority of
them deals with the adiabatic regime in superstrong ﬁelds and the early works are mostly Hartree-Fock
(HF) type calculations. There are also several early variational calculations for the low-ﬁeld domain
[21,30,31]. HF calculations for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths have been carried out in refs. [4,26] by applying
two diﬀerent sets of basis functions in the high- and low-ﬁeld regimes. As a result of the complicated
geometry this approach suﬀers in the intermediate regime from very slow convergence and low accuracy
of the calculated energy eigenvalues. Accurate HF calculations for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths were carried
out in refs. [25,27] by the 2D mesh HF method. Investigations on the ground state as well as a number

of excited states of helium including the correlation energy have recently been performed via a Quantum
Monte Carlo approach [29]. Very recently benchmark results with a precision of 10−4 − 10−6 for the
energy levels have been obtained for a large number of excited states with diﬀerent symmetries using a
conﬁguration interaction approach with an anisotropic Gaussian basis set [11].

Focusing on systems with more than two electrons however the number of investigations is very scarce
[23,28,32–34]. In view of the above there is a need for further quantum mechanical investigations and
for data on atoms with more than two electrons in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. For the carbon atom there
exist only two investigations [23] in the adiabatic approximation which give a few values for the binding
energies in the high ﬁeld regime and one more relevant recent work by Jones et al [28]. The latter contains
Hartree-Fock calculations for three states of the carbon atom in magnetic ﬁelds from γ = 0.0072 up to
γ = 21.6. The analysis of these results and in particular their comparison with our results are presented
in sections IV and V.

In the current work we apply a fully numerical 2D Hartree-Fock method to the problem of the carbon
atom in magnetic ﬁelds and obtain for the ﬁrst time conclusive results on the ground state conﬁgurations

2

for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths. Our approach enables us to perform calculations for various states with
approximately equal precision for weak, intermediate and high magnetic ﬁelds. To identify the ground
state for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths both general considerations and electronic structure calculations have
to be performed.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

We solve the electronic Schr¨odinger equation for the carbon atom in a magnetic ﬁeld under the as-

sumption of an inﬁnitely heavy nucleus in the (unrestricted) Hartree-Fock approximation. The numerical
approach applied in the present work coincides with that of our previous investigations [33,34]. The latter
contain some more details of the mesh techniques. The solution is established in the cylindrical coordi-
nate system (ρ, φ, z) with the z-axis oriented along the magnetic ﬁeld. We prescribe to each electron a
deﬁnite value of the magnetic quantum number mµ. Each one electron wave function Ψµ depends on the
variables φ and (ρ, z) as follows

Ψµ(ρ, φ, z) = (2π)

−1/2e

−imµφψµ(z, ρ)

(1)

where µ indicates the numbering of the electrons. The resulting partial diﬀerential equations for ψµ(z, ρ)
and the formulae for the Coulomb and exchange potentials have been presented in ref. [27].

The one-particle equations for the wave functions ψµ(z, ρ) are solved by means of the fully numerical
mesh method described in refs. [5,27]. The feature which distinguishes the present calculations from
those described in ref. [27] is the method of calculation of the Coulomb and exchange integrals. In the
present work as well as in ref. [33,34] we obtain these potentials as solutions of the corresponding Poisson
equation.

Our mesh approach is ﬂexible enough to yield precise results for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths. Some minor
decrease of the precision appears in very strong magnetic ﬁelds. This phenomenon is due to a growing
diﬀerence in the binding energies ǫB µ of one electron wave functions belonging to the same electronic
conﬁguration

ǫB µ = (mµ + |mµ| + 2szµ + 1)γ/2 − ǫµ

(2)

where ǫµ is the one electron energy and szµ is the spin z-projection. The precision of our results depends,
of course, on the number of the mesh nodes and can be improved in calculations with denser meshes.

Most of the present calculations are carried out on sequences of meshes with the maximal number of
nodes being 65 × 65.

It was demonstrated in ref. [33] that the one electron wave functions obtained in multi-electron Hartree-
Fock mesh calculations can for some atomic states possess a lower spatial symmetry than the symmetry
constrained traditional HF approaches based on basis sets. For example it was shown [33] for the 1s22s2
state of the beryllium atom that the wave functions of the 2s2 electrons reveal a broken spatial symmetry
with respect to the z = 0 plane. The contribution of this eﬀect to the total energy was found to be
In the case of the carbon atom the 2s2 electron pair belongs to the ground
signiﬁcant for γ > 0.5.
state conﬁguration for the regime γ ≤ 0.1862 (see table I) for which the symmetry breaking eﬀect does
not occur. On the other hand, we do not expect such kind of a broken symmetry for the ground state
conﬁgurations at strong magnetic ﬁelds because they involve wave functions with large absolute values of
the magnetic quantum numbers. Due to these reasons the present calculations are based on one electron
wave functions with a deﬁnite z-parity πz = ±1.

III. GROUND STATE ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS FOR γ = 0 AND γ → ∞

Let us provide some helpful qualitative considerations on the problem of the atomic multi-electron
ground states in the limit of strong magnetic ﬁelds. It is clear that the ﬁeld-free ground state of the
carbon atom remains the ground state only for relatively weak ﬁelds. The set of one electron wave

functions constituting the HF ground state for the opposite case of extremely strong magnetic ﬁelds
can be determined as follows. The nuclear attraction energies and HF potentials (which determine the
motion along z axis) are for large γ small compared to the interaction energies with the magnetic ﬁeld
(which determines the motion perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld and is responsible for the Landau
zonal structure of the spectrum). Thus, all the one electron wave functions must correspond to the
lowest Landau zones, i.e. mµ ≤ 0 for all the electrons, and the system must be fully spin-polarized, i.e.
szµ = − 1
2 . For the Coulomb central ﬁeld the one electron levels form quasi 1D Coulomb series with the
binding energy EB = 1
for nz > 0 and EB → ∞ for nz = 0, where nz is the number of nodal surfaces
2n2
z
of the wave function crossing the z axis.

Considering the case γ → ∞ it is evident, that the wave functions with nz = 0 have to be chosen
for the ground state conﬁguration. Furthermore starting with the energetically lowest one particle level
the electrons occupy according to the above arguments orbitals with increasing absolute value of the
magnetic quantum number mµ. Consequently the ground state of the carbon atom must be given by the
conﬁguration 1s2p−13d−24f−35g−46h−5.

For the opposite case γ = 0 it is well-known that the ground state of the carbon atom corresponds to the
spectroscopic term 3P . In the framework of the non-relativistic consideration this term consists of nine
states degenerate due to three possible z-projections of the total spin Sz = −1, 0, 1 and three possible
values of the total magnetic quantum number M = −1, 0, 1. Conventional Hartree-Fock calculations
provide the following values for the energy for this term: E = −37.688612 (Clementi and Roetti in [35])
and E = −37.68880 (Froese Fischer in [36]).

The problem of the conﬁgurations of the ground state for the intermediate ﬁeld region cannot be solved
without doing explicit calculations combined with some qualitative considerations in order to extract the
relevant conﬁgurations. With respect to our notation of the conﬁgurations we implicitly assume in the
following that all paired electrons, like for example the 1s2 part of a conﬁguration, are of course in a spin
up and spin down orbital, respectively, whereas all unpaired electrons possess a negative projection of

the spin onto the magnetic ﬁeld direction.

IV. GROUND STATE ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS FOR ARBITRARY FIELD

STRENGTHS

First of all, we divide the possible ground state conﬁgurations into three groups according to their total
spin projection Sz : the Sz = −1 group (low-ﬁeld ground state conﬁgurations), the intermediate group
Sz = −2 and the Sz = −3 group (the high-ﬁeld ground state conﬁgurations). This grouping is required
for the following qualitative considerations which are based on the geometry of the spatial parts of the
one electron wave functions.

To begin we would like to remark on our calculations for the atom without ﬁeld compared to the
traditional Hartree-Fock calculations. The Hartree-Fock energies for the 3P ground state of the ﬁeld-free
carbon atom have been given above. One important feature of the conventional Hartree-Fock calculations

4

[35,36] is the correspondence of each one electron wave function to only one spherical harmonic. As shown
for example in ref. [33] this restriction does not allow obtaining energies which correspond to the Hartree-
Fock limit in the sense of a fully free variation of the one-particle functions respecting the exact symmetries
of the total system. Not imposing the symmetries of the spherical harmonics on the one-particle functions
provides lower Hartree-Fock energies. This can be done, for instance, in 2D or 3D mesh Hartree-Fock
calculations. In the framework of our 2D mesh calculations the components of the multiplet 3P are built
up of diﬀerent one particle wave functions possessing as good quantum numbers the magnetic quantum
number mν, the z-parity and the spin projection sz. Due to the higher ﬂexibility of the one particle
wave functions our Hartree-Fock energies for all the components of the 3P multiplet are lower in energy
and are slightly diﬀerent for diﬀerent components of the multiplet. At γ = 0 the value of Sz does not
aﬀect the energy, whereas the spatial parts can contain three valence conﬁgurations: 2p02p−1, 2p02p+1
and 2p−12p+1 (the core part 1s22s2 of the total conﬁguration is omitted). Our energies for the 2p02p−1
and 2p02p+1 conﬁgurations coincide and are E = −37.69096, whereas the calculation for 2p−12p+1 gives

a slightly diﬀerent value namely E = −37.69376. It is evident that the energies of these conﬁgurations
must coincide in 3D HF calculations. On the other hand only the 1s22s22p02p−1 conﬁguration represents
the energetically lowest component of the 3P multiplet in weak magnetic ﬁelds. We therefore neglect here
and in the following the small diﬀerence in energy of the 1s22s22p02p+1, 1s22s22p−12p+1 1s22s22p02p−1
conﬁgurations in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld.

According to the arguments presented in the previous section we know that the ground state
conﬁguration of the carbon atom in the high ﬁeld limit must be the fully spin-polarized state
1s2p−13d−24f−35g−46h−5. The question of the ground state conﬁgurations at intermediate ﬁelds cannot
be solved without performing explicit electronic structure calculations. On the other hand, the a priori

set of possible intermediate ground state conﬁgurations increases enormously with increasing number
of electrons and is already for the carbon atom too many in order to perform explicit calculations for
all of them. Some qualitative considerations are therefore needed in order to exclude certain conﬁg-
urations as possible ground state conﬁgurations thereby reducing the number of candidates for which
explicit calculations have to be performed. The optimal strategy hereby consists of the repeated proce-
dure of determining neighbouring ground state conﬁgurations with increasing (or decreasing) magnetic
ﬁeld strength using both qualitative arguments (see below) as well as the results of the calculations for
concrete conﬁgurations.

The energies for all the considered states and in particular those of the ground states are illustrated
in ﬁgures 1-4. Figure 1 shows the total energies for the considered conﬁgurations with Sz = −1. Figure
2 and 3 illustrate the intermediate ground state scenario for the relevant conﬁgurations possessing the
spin projection Sz = −2. Figure 4 shows the relevant fully spin polarized conﬁgurations, i.e. the states
with Sz = −3. The reader should note that for each group of conﬁgurations the ﬁgures illustrate a
diﬀerent regime of ﬁeld strengths and energies. Finally we present in ﬁgure 5 the global scenario of the
total energies of the ground states for the range of considered ﬁeld strength 0 < γ < 100a.u. The vertical
lines shown in this picture divide the complete ﬁeld strength regime into diﬀerent regions for which
diﬀerent electronic conﬁgurations represent the ground state. The numerical values for the transition

ﬁeld strengths and the total energies at which the crossover between diﬀerent electronic conﬁgurations
takes place are given in table I. In the following paragraphs we describe in detail our selection procedure
for the candidates of the electronic ground state conﬁgurations.

We start our consideration for γ 6= 0 with the high-ﬁeld ground state and subsequently consider other
possible candidates in question for the electronic ground state for Sz = −3 (see ﬁgure 4) with decreasing

5

ﬁeld strength. All the one electron wave functions of the high-ﬁeld ground state 1s2p−13d−24f−35g−46h−5
possess no nodal surfaces crossing the z-axis and occupy the energetically lowest orbitals with magnetic
quantum numbers ranging from m = 0 down to m = −5. We shall refer to the number of the nodal
surfaces crossing the z axis as nz. The 6h−5 orbital possesses the smallest binding energy of all or-
bitals constituting the high-ﬁeld ground state. Its binding energy decreases rapidly with decreasing ﬁeld

strength. Thus, we can expect that the ﬁrst crossover of ground state conﬁgurations happens due to a
change of the 6h−5 orbital into one possessing a higher binding energy at the corresponding lowered range
of ﬁeld strength. It is natural to suppose that the ﬁrst transition while decreasing the magnetic ﬁeld
strength will involve a transition from an orbital possessing nz = 0 to one for nz = 1. The energetically
lowest available one particle state with nz = 1 is the 2p0 orbital. Another possible orbital into which
the 6h−5 wave function could evolve is the 2s state. For the hydrogen atom or hydrogen-like ions in a
magnetic ﬁeld the 2p0 is stronger bound than the 2s orbital. On the other hand, owing to the electron
screening in multielectron atoms in ﬁeld-free space the 2s orbital tends to be more tightly bound than the

2p0 orbital. Thus, two states i.e. the 1s2p02p−13d−24f−35g−4 state as well as the 1s2s2p−13d−24f−35g−4
conﬁguration are candidates for becoming the ground state in the Sz = −3 set when we lower the ﬁeld
strength coming from the high ﬁeld situation.

Analogous arguments lead to the three following candidates for the ground state in case of the second
crossover in the Sz = −3 subset which takes place with decreasing ﬁeld strength: 1s2s2p02p−13d−24f−3,
1s2p02p−13d−13d−24f−3 and 1s2s2p−13d−13d−24f−3. It is evident that the one particle energies for the
3d−1 and 2p0 obey E3d−1 > E2p0 for all values of γ since they possess the same nodal structure with
respect to the z-axis and only the 3d−1 possesses an additional node in the plane perpendicular to the
z-axis. For this reason the conﬁguration 1s2s2p−13d−13d−24f−3 can be excluded from our considerations

of the ground state. This conclusion is fully conﬁrmed by our calculations.

The ﬁnal picture of the ground state crossovers in the subset of conﬁgurations with Sz = −3 ob-
tained within our HF calculations is the following: At γ ≈ 18.664 the total energy E(γ) for the
1s2p02p−13d−24f−35g−4 conﬁguration intersects the total energy curve for the high-ﬁeld ground state
1s2p−13d−24f−35g−46h−5 and for γ < 18.664 the energy of the previous state is therefore lower than the
energy of the high-ﬁeld ground state. The 1s2p02p−13d−24f−35g−4 conﬁguration remains the energeti-
cally lowest one among all the six above-considered states with Sz = −3 in the regime 6.8 < γ < 18.664.
For γ < 6.8 the conﬁguration 1s2s2p02p−13d−24f−3 becomes the lowest one within the Sz = −3 subset.
However, this second crossover within the subset of states with Sz = −3 takes place in a regime of ﬁeld
strengths for which the global ground state conﬁguration of the carbon atom belongs already to the
subset Sz = −2. (See the state 1s22p−13d−24f−35g−4 in ﬁgure 4.) It should be noted that the structure
of the wave functions with Sz = −3 is simpler than in the two other spin subsets which we consider in
the following.

The considerations for the Sz = −2 subset of states whose energies are illustrated in ﬁgures 2 and
3, are similar to the ones of the subset Sz = −3. The most tightly bound state in the limit of high
ﬁelds is given by the 1s22p−13d−24f−35g−4 conﬁguration. When decreasing the ﬁeld strength this con-
ﬁguration can be replaced by 1s22p02p−13d−24f−3 or by 1s22s2p−13d−24f−3 (see ﬁgure 3). The next
change could lead to the conﬁgurations 1s22s2p02p−13d−2, 1s22p02p−13d−13d−2 or 1s22s2p−13d−13d−2
In analogy to our argumentation with the subset of states with Sz = −3 it is now obvi-
(ﬁgure 3).
ous that E1s22s2p02p−13d−2 < E1s22s2p−13d−13d−2 and the latter state cannot become the ground state
conﬁguration. Our electronic structure calculations provide the following sequence of ground states for
decreasing ﬁeld strength: for high ﬁelds we have the 1s22p−13d−24f−35g−4 conﬁguration, with decreas-

6

ing ﬁeld strength a crossover to the conﬁguration 1s22p02p−13d−24f−3 and with further decreasing ﬁeld
strength the conﬁguration 1s22s2p02p−13d−2. Having in mind these numerical results which are pre-
sented in ﬁgure 3 we provide next an analysis for further decreasing ﬁeld strength. It is clear that the
orbitals 1s2 and 2s2p02p−1 will be retained for further decreasing ﬁeld strength in the framework of the
Sz = −2 subspace. Thus the following transitions can aﬀect only the orbital 3d−2. This orbital could be
changed to the orbitals 3d−1, 3d0, 3p−1, 3s or 2p+1. The d-orbitals of this series can be excluded from
our consideration, since they have no preferences over 3d−2 with respect to the energy neither in strong
nor in weak ﬁelds and therefore calculations have to be performed only for the states 1s22s2p02p−13p−1,
1s22s2p02p−13s and 1s22s2p02p−12p+1. Explicit calculations (see ﬁgure 2) show that the ground state
is given by the 1s22s2p02p−12p+1 conﬁguration. It is evident that the latter conﬁguration is the ground
state conﬁguration of the subset Sz = −2 for the weak ﬁeld regime and in particular for γ = 0 and thus
it is the last in the sequence of the ground state conﬁgurations with Sz = −2. As it turns out in our HF
calculations this state as well as all other states which are ground states for Sz = −2 turn out to be the
ground state of the carbon atom as a whole, i.e. taking into account all spin manifolds Sz, for certain
regimes of the ﬁeld strength.

It is reasonable to start the considerations for the conﬁgurations with Sz = −1 which includes the weak
ﬁeld ground state conﬁguration 1s22s22p02p−1 by gradually increasing the ﬁeld strength from γ = 0. The
conﬁguration 1s22s22p02p−1 is rather robust and the most reasonable transition which could occur in
the framework of the conﬁgurations with Sz = −1 is the transition of one of the 2s electrons to the
2p−1 orbital i.e. the transition to conﬁguration 1s22s2p02p2
−1. The argument therefore is that at γ = 0
the 2s orbital is more bound than the 2p0 and 2p−1 and for increasing the ﬁeld the binding energy of
the 2p−1 orbital increases very rapidly. Our explicit calculations (see ﬁgure 1) show that this transition

takes place at γ ≈ 0.7, i.e.
in the regime, for which the ground state conﬁguration belongs already to
the subset Sz = −2. In addition to several other conﬁgurations with Sz = −1 we have also performed
calculations for the conﬁguration 1s22s22p2
−1 belonging to Sz = 0, which is also presented in ﬁgure 1.
This conﬁguration with the symmetry 1D is the ground state of the subset Sz = 0 at γ = 0. The
calculations for this state were necessary in order to exclude the possibility that it becomes the ground
state of the carbon atom for some region of the ﬁeld strength in the weak ﬁeld case.

The results of the investigations of this section are presented in table I which contains the critical values
of γ at which the crossovers of diﬀerent ground state conﬁgurations take place (see also ﬁgure 5). The

critical values of the ﬁeld strength given in table I are of course Hartree-Fock values and are expected to
shift slightly for fully correlated calculations.

V. SELECTED QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS

In table II we present the total energies of the seven ground state electronic conﬁgurations of the
carbon atom. The energy of each state is given at least in the range of ﬁeld strength within which it
represents the ground state (in many cases we have performed calculations for a much wider regime of
ﬁeld strengths). The conﬁgurations in table II are labeled by their corresponding numbers introduced
in table I. The data of the tables I and II represent the total energy values on a grid of ﬁeld strengths
covering the complete regime 0 ≤ γ ≤ 10000 and via interpolation can be used to get the total energies
for any ﬁeld strength.

The most important work in the literature containing results on the spectrum of the carbon atom in

7

a strong magnetic ﬁeld is ref. [28]. We have illustrate the data of ref. [28] together with our data (see
above) ﬁgures 1-4. Unfortunately ref. [28] does not contain a detailed description of the electronic states
of the carbon atom considered in their work: the data given for electronic states with Sz = −2 and
Sz = −3 cannot uniquely be identiﬁed with our electronic conﬁgurations since the quantum numbers of
the individual one particle functions of their HF procedure have not been speciﬁed. Nevertheless we can

compare the total energies of the lowest conﬁguration at a ﬁxed ﬁeld strength. As a general tendency
we observe that in most cases our energy values are signiﬁcantly lower than those of ref. [28]. Indeed,
ref. [28] obtained only three diﬀerent ground state conﬁgurations whereas the true picture, as described
above, involves seven diﬀerent electronic conﬁgurations and six associated crossovers. One can see in
ﬁgure 1 that it is diﬃcult to associate the ﬁrst three Sz = −1 points of ref. [28] presented in this picture
with any of our states. On the other hand some energy values given in ref. [28] lie close to our energies
which is the case for the conﬁguration 1s22s2p02p2
−1 and we perform the comparison with our results for
this state in table III.

A second source of data on the carbon atom in strong magnetic ﬁelds is ref. [23]. This work deals
exclusively with the high ﬁeld regime in which the adiabatic approximation represents a reasonable
approach to the wave functions and spectrum. The total energies of the ground state of the high ﬁeld limit
are given in ref. [23] for four diﬀerent values of the ﬁeld strength in the regime 42.544 ≤ γ ≤ 2127.2. Table
IV contains a comparison of those data with our HF data for the high ﬁeld ground state conﬁguration
1s2p−13d−24f−35g−46h−5. The third and fourth column represent our total energies and those of ref.
[23], respectively. As a general tendency our energies are of the order of magnitude of 0.1keV lower than
those of ref. [23]. This is a nonnegligible deviation in particular in view of the fact that it exceeds the
energy diﬀerence to the ﬁrst excited state shown in column ﬁve of table IV and for two points of the

lowest ﬁeld strength the situation is even worse: it exceeds the ionization energy of the atom, i.e. the
energy necessary to build the single positive charged ion C+ (see column six in table IV). We believe that
our results are much more accurate than those of ref. [23] since we do not involve any kind of adiabatic
approximation and deal with a ﬂexible wave function due to the ﬂexible mesh calculation of our one
particle functions.

Figure 6 allows us to add some details to the considerations of the previous section. This ﬁgure
presents spatial distributions of the total electronic densities for the ground state conﬁgurations of the
carbon atom. More exactly, this picture allows us to gain insights into the geometry of the distribution

of the electron density in space and in particular its dependence on the magnetic quantum number and
the total spin. Thereby we can understand the corresponding impact on the total energy of the atom.
The ﬁrst picture in this ﬁgure presents the distribution of the electron density in the ground state of the
carbon atom at γ = 0. The following pictures show the distributions of the electronic densities at values
of the ﬁeld strength which mark the boundaries of the regimes of ﬁeld strengths belonging to the diﬀerent
ground state conﬁgurations. For the high-ﬁeld ground state we present the distribution of the electronic
density at the crossover ﬁeld strength γ = 18.664 and for three additional values of γ up to γ = 1000.

For each conﬁguration the eﬀect of the increasing ﬁeld strength consists in compressing the electronic
distribution towards the z axis. However most of the crossovers of ground state conﬁgurations involve

the opposite eﬀect which is due to the fact that they are associated with an increase of the total magnetic
quantum number M = P

6
µ=1 mµ.

Two issues concerning the results presented above have to be discussed. First, our HF results do not
include the eﬀects of correlation. To take into account the latter would require a multiconﬁgurational
approach which goes beyond the scope of the present paper. We, however, do not expect that the

8

correlation energy changes our main conclusions like, for example, the fact of the crossovers with respect
to the diﬀerent ground states conﬁgurations. With increasing ﬁeld strength the eﬀective one particle
picture should be an increasingly better description of the wave function and the percentage of the
correlation energy should therefore decrease (see in particular ref. [37]). The concrete values of quantities
like, for example, the transition ﬁeld strengths or the ionization energies, depend however to some extent

on the approach used (Hartree-Fock, correlated methods).

Additional consideration are however required for the crossover situation itself which separates diﬀerent
electronic conﬁgurations of the ground state and for the other intersections presented in ﬁgures 1 to 4.
In principle, eﬀects of electronic correlation can turn level crossings into avoided crossings. In this case
the classiﬁcation of the ground state via a single conﬁguration of six one particle states should break
down and the discontinuous changes of the slope of the total energies at the points of crossovers should
be smoothened out. But we do not expect these eﬀects of correlation to occur for the ground state
Indeed, one can see in
conﬁgurations due to the diﬀerent symmetries of the conﬁgurations involved.

table I that all the neighboring ground state conﬁgurations have at least either diﬀerent total magnetic
quantum numbers or diﬀerent total spins. Thus, we do not expect that correlation eﬀects can lead to
avoided crossings in the energies of the ground state conﬁgurations of the carbon atom.

The second issue relates to eﬀects of the ﬁnite nuclear mass. For the case of hydrogen it is well-
known that in the high ﬁeld regime (γ >> 102) mass correction terms due to the ﬁnite nuclear mass
become relevant i.e. are no more negligible in comparison with the Coulomb binding energies. The
most important mass corrections can be included by replacing the electron mass through its reduced
mass and results from the inﬁnite nuclear mass calculations are related to those with the reduced mass
via a scaling relation [8,11]. In the case of the much heavier C atom these eﬀects are expected to be

suppressed signiﬁcantly due to the large nuclear mass. In addition the total Coulomb binding energy
increases rapidly with increasing nuclear charge number and is therefore for the carbon atom almost two
orders of magnitude larger compared to the hydrogen atom. This makes the eﬀects of the ﬁnite nuclear
mass less important than for hydrogen.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have applied our 2D mesh Hartree-Fock method to the magnetized carbon atom. The method
is ﬂexible enough to yield precise results for arbitrary ﬁeld strengths and our calculations for the
ground and several excited states are performed for magnetic ﬁeld strengths ranging from zero up to
2.3505 · 109T (γ = 10000). Our considerations focused on the ground state and its crossovers with in-
creasing ﬁeld strength. It undergoes six transitions involving seven diﬀerent electronic conﬁgurations.
For weak ﬁelds up to γ = 0.1862 the ground state arises from the ﬁeld-free ground state conﬁguration
1s22s22p02p−1 with the total spin z-projection Sz = −1. With increasing strength of the ﬁeld four dif-
ferent electronic conﬁgurations with Sz = −2 consequently become the ground state: 1s22s2p02p−12p+1,
1s22s2p02p−13d−2, 1s22p02p−13d−24f−3 and ﬁnally 1s22p−13d−24f−35g−4. At γ = 12.216 we observe
the ﬁrst fully spin polarized conﬁguration 1s2p02p−13d−24f−35g−4 with Sz = −3 to become the ground
state of the carbon atom. At γ = 18.664 the last crossover of the ground state conﬁgurations takes place
and ergo for γ > 18.664 the ground state wave function is represented by the high-ﬁeld-limit conﬁguration
1s2p−13d−24f−35g−46h−5, Sz = −3.

Our investigation represents the ﬁrst conclusive study of the ground state of the carbon atom for

9

arbitrary ﬁeld strengths. We have obtained a rather intricate sequence of electronic conﬁgurations with
increasing ﬁeld strength. This underlines the conjecture that the scenario of ground state crossovers with
changing ﬁeld strength complicates rapidly if we consider neutral atoms with increasing nuclear charge
number. Our computations have been performed in the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation. For
the conﬁgurations with Sz = −1 and Sz = −2 (not for those with Sz = −3) this means that our one
determinantal HF wave functions are not eigenfunctions of the operator of the total spin. An immediate
improvement of our approach would therefore require a multiconﬁgurational study. The development of
such a code capable of describing the wave function in arbitrarily strong magnetic ﬁelds is however a
major task and clearly goes beyond the scope of the present investigation. Putting together what we
currently know about ground states of atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds we can conclude that the H, He, Li
and C atomic ground states have been identiﬁed. This leaves plenty of questions open about the possible
ground state conﬁgurations of other atoms.

Optical pumping by blackbody radiation is a feature shared by all polar molecules and funda-
mentally limits the time that these molecules can be kept in a single quantum state in a trap. To
demonstrate and quantify this, we have monitored the optical pumping of electrostatically trapped
OH and OD radicals by room-temperature blackbody radiation. Transfer of these molecules to
rotationally excited states by blackbody radiation at 295 K limits the 1/e trapping time for OH and
OD in the X 2Π3/2, v′′ = 0, J ′′ = 3/2(f ) state to 2.8 s and 7.1 s, respectively.

In his 1917 paper Einstein showed [1] that even in the
absence of collisions the velocity distribution of a molec-
ular gas takes on a Maxwellian distribution due to the
momentum transfer that takes place in the absorption
and emission of blackbody radiation. The absorbed and
emitted photons optically pump the rotational and vi-
brational transitions, resulting in thermal distributions
over the available states. The rotational temperature of
the CN molecule in interstellar space [2], for example, is
the result of optical pumping by the cosmic microwave
background-radiation [3].

The inﬂuence of blackbody radiation on atoms and
molecules is in general small and it is rare that it can be
observed directly in laboratory experiments. However, in
a number of cases the interaction with blackbody radi-
ation is experimentally observable and important. The
ﬁrst dynamical eﬀects of blackbody radiation on the pop-
ulation of atomic levels were noticed when studying the
lifetime of highly excited Rydberg states in atoms [4].
Atoms in these states can have dipole moments of thou-
sands of Debye, and have suﬃcient spectral overlap with
the spectrum of room-temperature blackbody radiation.
The excitation (and ionization) rates can be on the or-
der of 1000 s−1, implying that the eﬀect can already be
observed on a µs timescale.

The excitation rates in ground state atoms and
molecules are generally much lower, and therefore require
a longer interaction time to be observed. Only with the
development of ion traps, together with a suﬃcient re-
duction of collisional energy exchange (i.e. a good vac-
uum at room temperature), could the photodissociation
of molecular ions and clusters by blackbody radiation be
directly observed [5, 6].
Ions in storage rings are also
trapped long enough for the interaction with blackbody
radiation to be noticeable [7].

The eﬀect of blackbody radiation on neutral molecules
in a trap has until now been left experimentally unex-
plored, partly because the conditions to observe the ef-
fect were not met, and partly because the importance
of this eﬀect was not always realized. Polar molecules
generally have strong vibrational and/or rotational tran-

sitions in the infrared region of the spectrum. As a result
they can relatively easily be optically pumped by room-
temperature blackbody radiation, and this fundamen-
tally limits the time that these molecules can be kept in
a single quantum state in room temperature traps. This
has important implications for cooling schemes which aim
at increasing the phase-space density of trapped neutral
polar molecules.

In the rapidly growing research ﬁeld of cold molecules,
these polar molecules are of special interest. When quan-
tum degeneracy is reached with polar molecules it will be
much diﬀerent from an atomic BEC or degenerate Fermi
gasses due to the dipole-dipole interaction [8, 9]. Trapped
polar molecules also hold promise for use in quantum
information systems [10]. Furthermore a search for a
permanent electric dipole moment of the electron, which
would result in the violation of time reversal symmetry,
is being done using polar molecules [11] because an ex-
ternal electric ﬁeld applied to a polar molecule leads to a
hugely magniﬁed internal ﬁeld. Quantum chemistry and
collisions at low energy [12] are other examples of the
possibilities with cold polar molecules.

Many of these exciting experiments require a dense
and cold sample of trapped polar molecules. Therefore
eﬀort in the research on cold molecules is currently aimed
at increasing the phase-space density of the trapped
molecules [13]. A natural approach to try to reach this
goal is to adapt the cooling techniques such as evapora-
tive cooling [14] and sympathetic cooling [15], but these
cooling techniques require usually trapping times of 10 s
or more. Therefore an investigation of blackbody radi-
ation as a limiting factor for the trapping time of polar
molecules is of importance. Also for future studies of col-
lisions between trapped molecules a quantitative under-
standing of all trap loss mechanisms is essential. In this
Letter we experimentally quantify trap loss due to black-
body radiation for neutral polar molecules stored in a
room-temperature trap, using the OH radical as a model
system. Cold packets of OH radicals are produced using
the Stark deceleration and trapping technique[16, 17].

A natural approach to experimentally study the eﬀect

of blackbody radiation on the trapped molecules would
be to vary the temperature of the trapping apparatus,
thereby changing both the spectral distribution and the
intensity of the blackbody radiation. A disadvantage of
this is that normally a change of the temperature will
also inﬂuence the vacuum conditions, changing the colli-
sion rate with the residual gas. The alternative approach
we have taken is to compare the room-temperature trap-
ping of two isotopic variants of the same molecule. Under
the assumption that these isotopomers have the same
collisional properties, the trap losses due to blackbody
radiation and collisions with background gas can be dis-
entangled.

The molecules we have compared are the OH and
OD radical. There is suﬃcient intensity in the low-
energy side of the blackbody radiation spectrum that
these molecules can be rotationally excited; the vibra-
tional energy splitting is so large that vibrational excita-
tion is negligible. The energies of the relevant rotational
states of OH and OD in the X 2Π-state are depicted in
ﬁgure 1. Each rotational level is split into two Λ-doublet
components with opposite parity, denoted by f and e.
In an electric ﬁeld these components are mixed. In the
electric ﬁeld, each J-state is split into (2J + 1) MJ Ω
components. The f component in zero-ﬁeld corresponds
with (2J + 1)/2 low-ﬁeld seeking components in an elec-
tric ﬁeld; the e component corresponds with (2J + 1)/2
high-ﬁeld seeking components.

Blackbody radiation can excite transitions with
∆MJ = ±1, 0. Molecules trapped in low-ﬁeld seeking
states can be pumped to high-ﬁeld seeking states, lead-
ing to trap loss. Because the rotational constant B is
almost a factor of two larger for OH than for OD, the
intensity of the room-temperature blackbody radiation
is much higher at the excitation energy of the ﬁrst ro-
tational excitation for OH molecules than it is for OD
molecules. The most important transition rates due to
the blackbody radiation connecting the f -components of
the lowest rotational levels are indicated next to the ar-
rows in ﬁgure 1. The diﬀerence in the excitation rates
leads us to expect signiﬁcantly shorter trapping times
for OH than for OD radicals.

The production, deceleration and trapping of OH has
already been described elsewhere [18]; here we summarize
the main procedure. The experimental setup is schemat-
ically depicted in ﬁgure 2. The OH (OD) radicals are
created, in separate experiments, by photodissociation
of HNO3 (DNO3), co-expanded with xenon as a carrier
gas in a pulsed supersonic expansion. After the expan-
sion both OH and OD are mostly in the electronic, vibra-
tional and rotational ground state X 2Π3/2 (v=0, J=3/2).
The MJ Ω = −9/4 component of the 3/2(f ) state is
the strongest low-ﬁeld-seeking state and is focussed by a
hexapole lens into the decelerator. Using 108 deceleration
stages a part of the beam is brought to a standstill, and
subsequently trapped in an electrostatic quadrupole trap.

FIG. 1: In the upper part, the room-temperature spectrum of
blackbody radiation is shown. The relevant region for rota-
tional excitation of OH and OD radicals is shown, with sticks
indicating the lowest rotational excitation frequency. In the
lower part the relevant rotational levels of OH and OD are de-
picted. Each rotational level is split into two Λ-doublet com-
ponents with opposite parity, denoted by f and e. The size
of the splitting is exaggerated for clarity. The most relevant
transition rates (in s−1) due to blackbody radiation connect-
ing the f -components of rotational levels are indicated next
to the arrows.

In these experiments the OD radical, which is predicted
to have interesting collisional properties [19], has been
trapped for the ﬁrst time. Due to their similar mass and
dipole moment OH and OD are equally well decelerated
and trapped. We estimate the trapped number density to
be about 107 molecules/cm3, and have not found any in-
dication of collisions between the trapped molecules. The
trapped molecules, probed by laser-induced-ﬂuorescence
directly after switching oﬀ the trapping voltages, are ini-
tially exclusively in the MJ Ω = −9/4 component of the
3/2(f ) state.

We have measured, for OH and OD, the population
trapped in the 3/2(f ) state, up to a trapping time of
15 seconds. The results are shown in the upper part of
ﬁgure 3. The OD molecules remain, as expected, approx-
imately a factor of two longer in the 3/2(f ) state than
the OH molecules. To interpret the data we have used
a rate equation model, describing the time evolution of
the population in the rotational states. The curves in
ﬁgure 3 show the outcome of this model. Molecules can

FIG. 2: Scheme of the experimental setup. OH (OD) radicals
are created by photodissociation of supersonically expanded
(deuterated) nitric acid, and subsequently decelerated in a
Stark decelerator. The slowed molecules are trapped in an
electrostatic trap, and the population in the diﬀerent rota-
tional states is probed by laser-induced ﬂuorescence detec-
tion. In the inset the arrival of undecelerated OD molecules
followed by the steady signal of the trap-loaded OD molecules
is shown, up to 20 ms after production of the molecules. We
have detected the trapped molecules up to 15 s.

be pumped from the 3/2(f ) state to the 5/2(f ) state,
in which they can remain trapped. The time-evolution
of the 5/2(f ) population follows from the rate-equation
model. The results of the measurement of the popula-
tion in this state are shown in the lower part of ﬁgure 3.
About 5 % of the original OD population accumulates in
the 5/2(f ) state after 3 seconds of trapping. For OH the
maximum in the 5/2(f ) population occurs after 1 second
of trapping. From the 5/2(f ) state the molecules can be
pumped to other rotational states again, spontaneously
decay back to the 3/2(f ) state or be lost due to collisions
with the background gas.

For the model, the transition strengths of all allowed
transitions between the MJ -components of the rotational
states (for both Ω manifolds, up to J = 7/2) in OH
and OD are calculated. The energy diﬀerences caused
by hyperﬁne eﬀects, the Stark shift of the levels in the
electric ﬁeld of the trap and the Λ-doubling itself are
so small compared to the rotational spacing that these
are neglected in the calculation of the transition rates.
Using the calculated transition strengths and the spec-
trum of the blackbody radiation at 295 K the transi-
tion rates due to the blackbody radiation are obtained,
as shown in ﬁgure 1. Because not all MJ -components
have an equal Stark shift the diﬀerent trapping depths
for these states were taken into account. Molecules ex-
cited to the J ≥ 7/2 states are considered lost from the
trap. Stimulated emission was also included. Loss due
to collisions with residual background gas, assumed to
be independent of the rotational level, is taken into ac-

count by a constant loss rate. We ﬁnd best agreement
between the model and the data using a background-gas
loss rate of 0.17 s−1[21]. To verify whether this loss rate
can be explained by collisions with a xenon background
gas we have used the recently calculated cross-section for
Xenon-OH collisions [12], taken to be identical for OH
and OD. For a room temperature gas of xenon atoms
colliding with trapped OH molecules the average colli-
sion energy is 30 cm−1, leading to an elastic cross section
of 500 ± 50 ˚A2; rotational excitation of trapped OH and
OD by the xenon atoms can safely be neglected. Because
the trap depth is only about 1 cm−1 almost every colli-
sion will lead to trap loss. Using a partial xenon pressure
of 5 · 10−9 mbar we ﬁnd a collision rate of 0.14 s−1, which
is consistent with the rate found from the comparison of
the model with the data.

We have calculated the blackbody pumping rates for a
number of other polar molecules as well. These molecules
are well suited for trapping, using the various currently
available techniques [13]. For the selected molecules the
blackbody pumping rate out of the speciﬁed initial quan-
tum state is compared, for two diﬀerent temperatures, in
table I. The initial state is in most cases the electronic,

vibrational and rotational ground state. The rate for OH
is slightly larger than the sum of the rates indicated in
ﬁgure 1 due to the eﬀect of hyperﬁne structure that was
included in these calculations.

The room-temperature pumping rate for many of the
listed molecules is comparable to that of OH and OD.
LiH, with its favorable Stark-eﬀect to mass ratio and
the existence of 4 isotopomers often considered an ideal
candidate molecule [20], is especially sensitive to black-
body radiation: even at 77 K it can only be trapped
for a few seconds. At 4 K the rates for all molecules
are smaller than 10−3. Depending on the molecule the
pumping rate is either dominated by rotational transi-
tions (OH/OD,NH/ND,LiH/LiD), by vibrational tran-
sitions (CO,RbCs,KRb) or by a combination of both.
CO, RbCs and KRb have very small blackbody pumping
rates.

In this Letter we have experimentally studied trap
loss of neutral polar molecules due to room-temperature
blackbody radiation, using the OH radical as a model
system. By comparing the trapping times of OH and
OD radicals in an electrostatic quadrupole trap, the indi-
vidual contribution of blackbody radiation and collisions
with background gas could be quantiﬁed. Loss due to
blackbody radiation is a major limitation for the room-
temperature trapping OH and OD radicals. If the vac-
uum conditions were improved such that losses due to col-
lisions with background gas are completely removed, the
1/e trapping time would increase to 7.1 s for OD and 2.8
s for OH. The trapped molecules will have to be shielded
from thermal radiation if longer trapping times are re-
quired. We have shown that these limitations are shared
by a large class of polar molecules, which has profound
consequences for the implementation of further cooling
schemes.

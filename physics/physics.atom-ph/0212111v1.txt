We theoretically examine collective two-color photoassociation of a 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate,
focusing on stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) from atoms to molecules. In particular,
Drummond et al. [Phys. Rev. A 65, 063619 (2002)] have predicted that particle-particle interactions
limit the eﬃciency of atom-molecule conversion to around forty percent. We demonstrate that
mean-ﬁeld shifts can be sidelined by switching to modest densities, and that STIRAP subsequently
proceeds at near-unit eﬃciency.

Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) from
an atomic to a molecular condensate [1] in the pres-
ence of particle-particle interactions was recently inves-
tigated [2]. For initial 87Rb condensate densities ρ
≃
1014 cm−3, Drummond et al. [2] predict that, while
5
atom-molecule STIRAP is feasible in principle, the con-
version eﬃciency is limited in practice to about 40%, a
limit imposed by two-photon dephasing caused by parti-
cle interactions. The purpose of this Comment is to point
out that the role of particle-particle interactions can be
downgraded simply be reducing the condensate density
1012 cm−3), and that STIRAP
to modest values (ρ
from an atomic to a molecular condensate will subse-
quently proceed with near-unit eﬃciency (

80%).

neous decay is included with the rate γs. Due to the
generally large value for the spontaneous decay rate of
the excited-molecular condensate, any mean-ﬁeld shifts
for this state can be safely omitted.

The idea of minimizing the role of mean-ﬁeld shifts
with a modest density is borrowed from investiga-
tions into forming a molecular condensate via Feshbach-
resonant interactions [5], where the goal is basically to
avoid the eﬀects of collision-induced vibrational relax-
ation of the so-formed molecules to lower-lying levels,
and where such losses are included as a complex particle-
particle scattering length. We therefore use the density
105s−1
1012 cm−1 as an example, so that χ0 = 2
ρ = 5

and Λ =

375 s−1.

Oﬀ hand, we see that the mean-ﬁeld shift is roughly
three orders of magnitude lower than the peak Bose-
enhanced free-bound coupling χ0, and since it is χ0 that
sets the timescale for atom-molecule STIRAP [1], we ex-
pect particle interactions to play only a minor role. This
intuition is conﬁrmed by the results shown in Fig. 1. In
order to achieve eﬃcient conversion for the shortest possi-
ble pulse width, it turns out that asymmetric pulses [2,6]
are indeed an advantage (see below): eﬃcient conver-
sion to a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate should be
achievable on a timescale T = 5
10 ms [see
Fig. 1(b)].

There are, as usual, a few things that remain ne-
glected. Beginning with trap dynamics, we note that,
for a spherically symmetric trap in the Thomas-Fermi
1014 cm−3
limit, our decrease in density from ρ0 = 5
1012 cm−3 correspondingly reduces the trap
to ρ = 5
frequency from ωr/2π = 100 Hz [2] to ωr/2π = 2 Hz (pre-
suming a ﬁxed atom number), so that the motion of our
500 ms. Thanks to the
atoms will occur on a timescale
faster conversion enabled by asymmetric pulses, the trap
dynamics should have a negligible eﬀect on the eﬃciency.

Moreover, we have neglected the presence of any ad-
ditional molecular levels, as well as bound-bound transi-
tions induced by the photoassociation laser [2]. The in-
105 s−1)
termediate detuning consider here (δ = χ0 = 2
is trivial compared to the molecular level spacing (
∼
1010 s−1), and the lower density allows for exact two-
= 0 in Ref. [2]). Omit-
photon resonance (compared to ∆
ting these eﬀects should not be unreasonable.

×

Finally, there is the fact that the so-formed molecules
are vibrationally very hot [2], meaning that molecule-
molecule and atom-molecule collisions may foster re-
laxation to lower-lying vibrational levels. There is no
known handle on this quenching rate (thus the neglect in
Ref. [2]). Just the same, we note that a lower density is
favorable on this account also (like the mean-ﬁeld shifts,
the quenching rate is proportional to ρ), and the achieve-
ment of eﬃcient STIRAP for a lower peak bound-bound
Rabi coupling (Ω0/χ0 = 50 compared to 103 [2]) means
that, for user-friendly bound-bound laser intensities [2],
it is possible to target vibrationally cooler (i.e., lower-
lying) levels. All told, favorable quenching rates should
be achievable as well.

In conclusion, we suggest that trap dynamics and
particle-particle collisions can be made negligible in the
realization of near-unit eﬃcient Bose-stimulated Raman
adiabatic passage in photoassociation, and that any vi-
brational quenching can be managed as well. This result
is based on the observation that the density of the ini-
tial atomic condensate can be treated as an optimization
parameter. Near-unit eﬃcient production of molecular
Bose-Einstein condensate via collective photoassociation
is now left to experimental design.

We investigate photodetachment from negative ions in a homogeneous 1.0 Tesla magnetic ﬁeld
and a parallel electric ﬁeld of ∼ 10 V/cm. A theoretical model for detachment in combined ﬁelds
is presented. Calculations show that a ﬁeld of 10 V/cm or more should considerably diminish the
Landau structure in the detachment cross section. The ions are produced and stored in a Penning
ion trap and illuminated by a single-mode dye laser. We present preliminary results for detachment
from S− showing qualitative agreement with the model. Future directions of the work are also
discussed.

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

One of the long-term objectives of photodetachment
studies has been to shed light on electron correlation
eﬀects and other electron-atom interactions. One way
to enhance photodetachment studies is to add exter-
nal electric or magnetic ﬁelds. These potentials cre-
ate conditions in negative ions not found in neutral
atoms, and permit comparisons with phenomena ob-
served in neutral atom photoionizaton. For example,
photodetachment in a static electric ﬁeld environment re-
leases an electron that experiences an acceleration anal-
ogous to that of freefall. External ﬁelds permit stud-
ies of interference phenomena and provide insight into
the connection between quantum mechanics and semi-
classical closed-orbit theories. A large amount of atten-
tion, both theoretical and experimental, has been given
to photodetachment in the presence of external ﬁelds
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31].

Photodetachment can be thought of as the latter half
of a collision between an electron and a neutral atom. In
general, the eﬀect of an external ﬁeld is to cause a por-
tion of the out-going electron wave function to return to
the atomic core, where additional interactions may oc-
cur. For example, an electric ﬁeld creates a potential
slope, and the electron wave function travelling uphill

the wave function emitted in the upward and downward
directions. The time diﬀerence, and thus the relative
phase between the two waves, depends on the detached
electron’s energy and momentum, and diminishes with
increasing applied ﬁeld. The interference gives rise to
oscillatory structure in the detachment cross section de-
pending on the relative phase between the waves. The ef-
fect has been observed and discussed in numerous papers
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 28, 29, 30, 31]. Throughout the
reﬂection process the electron wave function spreads, un-
constrained, in the directions perpendicular to the ﬁeld.
Thus, a larger electric ﬁeld causes a larger portion of
the wave function to revisit the core, yielding a larger
interference amplitude. Most of the experimental obser-
vations have employed a ﬁeld on the order of 100 V/cm
or more in order to resolve the oscillatory structure in
the detachment rate [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

A similar interference occurs in the presence of a mag-
netic ﬁeld, whose eﬀect is to constrain and quantize the
motion of the outgoing electron in the plane normal to
the magnetic ﬁeld [32]. The ﬁeld-free detachment thresh-
old is replaced by a series of Landau thresholds in the
cross section at uniformly spaced photon energies cor-
responding to the cyclotron states [2, 3]. This periodic
structure in the cross section arises from the outgoing
electron wave function constructively interfering with it-
self, as the orbiting electron revisits the core once every
cyclotron period. This interference structure is in one
sense more apparent than that produced by an electric
ﬁeld because the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁnes the electron in
two dimensions, and consequently a larger portion of the
wave function returns to the core. Similar structure has
also been observed in photoionization in a magnetic ﬁeld
[12, 33, 34].

Interference is suppressed if the cyclotron-orbiting elec-
tron does not strictly return to the core. This situation

can be brought about in a couple of ways. One is to in-
troduce a small, static electric ﬁeld parallel to the mag-
netic ﬁeld. Such a ﬁeld tends to accelerate the electron
away from the ion core along the ﬁelds’ axes, diminishing
or even eliminating the dramatic interference of the cy-
clotron states [23, 24, 25, 26]. The electric ﬁeld eﬀectively
“opens” the closed cyclotron orbits. Earlier quantum me-
chanical calculations [19, 35], as well as those in this pa-
per, show that a ﬁeld on the order of 10 V/cm should
signiﬁcantly reduce the Landau structure observed in the
detachment cross section. A commensurate prediction
can be made from a semiclassical calculation assuming
that, in order to have constructive interference, the elec-
tron must return to the atomic core within half a Bohr
wavelength in one cyclotron period. Furthermore, the
motional Stark ﬁeld experienced by a thermally ener-
getic ion aﬀects the interference. In the ion’s rest frame,
a motional electric ﬁeld perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld causes the electron to drift away from the core, di-
minishing resolution of magnetic ﬁeld structure in the
photodetachment rate. Again, theoretical calculations,
both quantum mechanical and semiclassical, predict that
a motional ﬁeld on the order of 10 V/cm or more tends to
wash out the cyclotron structure found in the magnetic
ﬁeld-only cross section [19, 21].

Experimentally, it is common for stray electric ﬁelds
to be present (such as that used in a Penning trap,
discussed below, or motional Stark ﬁelds), so it is im-
portant to understand how such ﬁelds aﬀect the de-
tachment spectrum. Although detachment in combined
external ﬁelds has been discussed extensively in the
literature, it has received little experimental attention
[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 35, 36]. In this pa-
per we present a theoretical prediction for detachment
in combined, parallel external ﬁelds. We then describe
an experiment to observe detachment from S− in par-
allel ﬁelds of 1.0 Tesla and 9 V/cm. Preliminary results
are shown to be in qualitative agreement with the model,
and ﬁnally, future directions for this work are discussed.

II. THEORETICAL DESCRIPTION

For a theoretical analysis of the photodetachment rate,
we employ the quantum source formalism.
In this ap-
proach the scattering event is divided into two separate
stages, absorption of a photon and subsequent emission
of the photoelectron into the external ﬁeld environment.

2

In near-threshold photodetachment, the emitting ion is
conveniently described as a pointlike source of electrons,
the dynamics of which follow from the quantum propa-
gator for the external potential. Details of the method
are presented in a forthcoming publication [31]. Partic-
ularly simple expressions are found for s-wave detach-
ment in a uniform electric ﬁeld [30]. Our predictions for
both the total detachment cross section and the spatial
distribution of the photoelectrons are in excellent agree-
ment with the photocurrent spectrum recorded by Gib-
son et al. [9, 11] and the photodetachment microscope
images recorded by Blondel and colleagues [28, 29], re-
spectively.

A. Source model of photodetachment

In the quantum source picture, the motion of a pho-
toelectron that is emitted with an initial kinetic energy
E close to zero is governed by the modiﬁed Schr¨odinger
equation:

E

{

H(r, p)
}

−

·

ψ(r) = C

δ(r) .

(1)

Here, we modelled the emitting ion as a pointlike en-
tity, and subsumed the details of the laser-ion interac-
tion in the source strength parameter C. The solution
to (1) is given by the energy Green function G(r, o; E)
describing an outgoing wave in the external potential:
ψ(r) = C
G(r, o; E). The energy Green function, in
turn, is linked to the familiar time-dependent quantum
propagator K(r, t

o, 0) by a Laplace transform [37]:

where ωL = eB/(2m) is the Larmor frequency, and
Fk, F⊥ denote the electric ﬁeld components parallel and

perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld, respectively.

While Eq. (4) yields the detachment rate for a sta-
tionary ion undergoing any particular transition in an
arbitrary ﬁeld geometry, we have to keep in mind that
in the actual experiment, (i) the ions are moving in the
trap, (ii) an external electric ﬁeld accelerates the ions,
and, (iii) transitions between diﬀerent magnetic sublevels
with generally diﬀering source strength parameters C and
electron excess energies E are occurring simultaneously.
We assess these complications below.

B. Thermal motion of the ions

The source model, formally expressed in the stationary
Schr¨odinger Eq. (1), implicitly requires that the emitting
ion is at rest. Obviously, this condition is not met by
the trapped ions which possess an average kinetic energy
Ekini
2 kBT , where T denotes the eﬀective tempera-
h
ture of the ion cloud. To be speciﬁc, in the following we
assume thermal equilibrium, i. e., the (kinetic) momen-
tum distribution P (p) of the cloud is given by Maxwell’s
familiar expression:

Here, M = 32 amu is the mass of the sulfur ions. To
obtain the proper detachment rates for a moving ion, we
switch to its rest frame of reference. The transforma-
tion between the laboratory frame and the rest frame
involves a Lorentz boost operation that alters the elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds perceived by the ion [39]. Since
the ion momentum is small, β = p/(M c)
1, we neglect
quadratic and higher contributions in β. This approxi-
mation leaves the magnetic ﬁeld B unchanged, while the
electric ﬁeld F is augmented by a motional electric ﬁeld
that is perpendicular to p and B:

≪

F(p) = F +

Clearly, the additional electric ﬁeld compensates for the
magnetic Lorentz force exerted on the moving ion in the
laboratory frame.

Beside the uniform ﬁelds present in the trap, the
change of reference frame also aﬀects the frequency of
the detaching laser beam, and hence the photon energy
~Ω. The parameter E appearing in the Green function
G(r, o; E) (2) is the excess energy of the photoelectron,
i. e., the diﬀerence between ~Ω and the electron aﬃnity
EA of the negative ion. The Doppler corrected electronic
energy ~Ω
EA in the rest frame of the ion is given in
leading order by:

In the experiment,
however, only the average detachment rate Javerage(Ω) is
accessible which follows from J(E) (4) after integration
over the thermal Maxwell distribution (5):

Javerage(Ω) =

d3p P (p)J(p) .

(8)

Z

We ﬁnally mention that the detachment rate in principle
depends not only on the momentum p of the ions, but
also on their position r in the trap. After all, an elec-
tric quadrupole is used to conﬁne the ions in the axial
direction which gives rise to an additional electric ﬁeld
that varies linearly with r. However, this ﬁeld is compar-
atively weak, and while it can be incorporated into the
source formalism without fundamental diﬃculties, for the
sake of simplicity we neglect it here. Furthermore, this
approximation facilitates direct comparison of the source
model with the theory put forward by Blumberg et al.
[3].

C. Time-dependent external ﬁeld

In section II A, we obtained an expression for the de-
tachment rate J(E) (4) that was derived under the condi-
tion of a static electric ﬁeld F. Obviously, this ﬁeld accel-
erates the ion cloud, and under truly static conditions, its
center would settle into a new equilibrium position in the
quadrupole potential that eﬀectively eliminates the elec-
tric ﬁeld. Our setup avoids this problem by driving the
ions using an oscillating external ﬁeld whose frequency
ωext considerably exceeds the resonance frequency of the
trap ωtrap, but still falls far short of the typical frequen-
1011 Hz) [40]. Under
cies of electronic motion (ωL ∼
these circumstances, photodetachment takes place in a
quasi-static external electric ﬁeld Fext(α) = Fext cos α,
where α = ωextt, while the measurement extends over
many periods of the electric ﬁeld amplitude. Similar to
(8), the eﬀective photodetachment rate Jeﬀ (Ω) then is
given by the average of J(E) over a complete period of
the phase angle α of the external ﬁeld:

Jeﬀ(Ω) =

dα Javerage(Ω, α) .

(9)

Z

At this point, we note that the momentum distribution
P (p) (5) in the driving external ﬁeld becomes dependent
on the phase angle α: P (p, α) = P (p
eFext sin α/ωext).
However, in the conﬁguration used in our experiment,
Fext is oriented parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld axis, while
the laser beam points in the perpendicular direction. It
immediately follows that the modiﬁed momentum distri-
bution does not aﬀect the corrections (6) and (7). We
thus may combine (8) and (9) to ﬁnd the eﬀective de-
tachment rate for any individual transition:

where ˆn denotes the unit vector in direction of the
laser beam. The corrections (6) and (7) cause a depen-
dence of the detachment rate on the ionic momentum

At zero temperature and vanishing electric ﬁeld, these
expressions reduce to the original expression for the de-
tachment rate (4). At this stage, only the temporal inte-
gration remains. Choosing a suitable path of integration
allows for accurate evaluation of (11). We deform the
integration path into the complex plane (carefully avoid-
ing the singularities of the integrand) and perform the
integration numerically.

In Fig. 1 we show typical results for diﬀerent ionic tem-
peratures in a purely magnetic ﬁeld. To compare with
the earlier results by Blumberg et al., we used the same
parameter set as in Fig. 2 of Ref. [3] for the dashed curve.
Both calculations are in excellent agreement, although
they are obtained by quite diﬀerent methods: Blum-
berg et al. use a sum over Landau levels to represent
the current, and subsequently perform a numerical ther-
modynamic average. The more general approach pre-
sented here allows to incorporate an electric, even time-
dependent ﬁeld at an arbitrary angle. Despite the inclu-
sion of these additional features, a single numerical inte-
gration suﬃces to accomplish the calculation of the prop-
erly weighted detachment rate. With decreasing temper-
ature, the Landau levels become more pronounced, while
the additional modulations visible in Fig. 1 persist. They
may be traced to the perpendicular motional electric ﬁeld
(6).

The eﬀects of the additional oscillating parallel ﬁeld
Fext cos(ωextt) are illustrated in Fig. 2. Two major trends
are easily discernible: First, the resolution into discrete
Landau levels loses contrast with increasing electric ﬁeld.
In particular, the substructure seen in Fig. 1 is absent.

the result for a purely magnetic ﬁeld. (Magnetic ﬁeld: B =

the ﬁgure (Fext = 28 V/cm), the shape of the detach-
ment rate spectrum is already reminiscent of the “stair-
case” appearance characteristic for s–wave detachment
in a purely electric external ﬁeld [9, 11, 14, 30, 31].
The other conspicuous feature in Fig. 2 is a consistent
shift of the photocurrent maxima towards higher ener-
gies. For a qualitative explanation, we note that in a
purely magnetic ﬁeld, the partial current Jν(E, Fk = 0)
(4) for detachment into the νth Landau level of the elec-
tron becomes singular at the threshold Eν = (2ν +1)~ωL:

. This conjecture is supported by numerical
calculations.

Much of the smooth appearance of the detachment
rate in Fig. 2 is actually due to the averaging eﬀect of
a time-dependent electric ﬁeld, as Fig. 3 demonstrates.
The integration over the phase angle α of the external
electric ﬁeld Fext cos α (9) eﬀectively obliterates the os-
cillations in the photocurrent caused by self-interference
of the emitted electron wave (Section I). In fact, a com-

5

parison of the eﬀective rate Jeﬀ (Ω) (9) for the parallel
ﬁeld Fext = 1400 V/m with the detachment cross section
Javerage(Ω) (8) in a constant parallel ﬁeld with equal rms
value (Fk = 1000 V/m) shows coinciding overall struc-
ture, while the numerous small-scale variations seen in
the constant ﬁeld curve are missing in the averaged rate.

D.

Inﬂuence of magnetic substructure

Unfortunately it is not possible to measure the (aver-
aged) total current depicted in Figs. 1–3 directly. The
magnetic ﬁeld causes Zeeman splitting of the magnetic
sublevels of the ion and atom, and consequently several
transitions closely spaced in energy contribute simulta-
neously to the photodetachment spectrum. Here, we an-
alyze the situation encountered for the sulfur ions used
in the experiment, where the transition between the ﬁne
structure components 2P3/2 of the S− ion and 3P2 of the
emerging neutral S atom was observed near the threshold
at EA = 2.0771 eV [2, 3].

both with and without the external electric ﬁeld. The

pressure of 7
The trap’s magnetic ﬁeld is held ﬁxed at 1.0 Tesla. The
experiment is performed with a trapped ensemble on the
order of 104 ions. A relative measure of the number of
trapped ions is made by resonantly driving the ions’ ax-
ial motion with a radio frequency voltage of 188 kHz
applied to the trap end caps. The image current induced
on the ring electrode is detected at twice the driving fre-
quency by a tuned antenna coil, and the resulting voltage
is then ampliﬁed in a heterodyne detection scheme. The
trap and its detection scheme provide a nearly noiseless
integrator of the trapped ion population, with noise in-
troduced only upon output of the signal [2].

The ions are photodetached with light from a tun-
able laser. The laser system, shown in Fig. 4, consists
of a standing-wave dye laser pumped by an Ar+ gas
laser. The dye laser uses rhodamine 6G dye to produce
roughly 100 mW at approximately 597 nm. The con-
tinuously tunable output oscillates on a single longitudi-
nal mode. The laser output is measured by a travelling
Michelson interferometer wavelength meter with a reso-
lution of 0.02 cm−1 [43]. The laser mode is monitored
by a Fabry-Perot spectrum analyzer with a 1500-MHz
free spectral range. The laser beam is directed through
the ion trap and the transmitted ﬂux is recorded by a
photodiode. A feedback signal from the photodiode to
a mechanical shutter maintains constant integrated light
intensity from cycle to cycle of the experiment.

The electric ﬁeld is combined parallel to the trap’s
magnetic ﬁeld by adding a low radio frequency potential
to the trap end caps. A typical frequency on the order of
1 MHz gives a ﬁeld which is nearly static on the time scale
of the photodetached electrons’ 36-picosecond cyclotron
period. Of course, this electric ﬁeld is not perfectly con-
stant; thus a time average is calculated to quantify the
ﬁeld strength. The radio frequency is applied through
a balun transformer which insures opposite polarity on
the end caps. An electrostatic analysis of the trap’s hy-
perbolic electrodes shows that the applied ﬁeld is linear
throughout the trapping volume. The electrostatic anal-
ysis also gives a measure of the ﬁeld strength, depending
on the peak-to-peak applied radio frequency voltage.

One cycle of data acquisition consists of a background
signal measurement by the ion detection electronics, fol-
lowed by an ion creation period, an initial ion signal
measurement, an optical interaction period, and a ﬁnal

ion signal measurement. The ion creation period typi-
cally lasts 8 seconds and the optical interaction typically
lasts 500 ms. The ratio of the two ion signal measure-
ments yields the fraction of ions surviving the interac-
tion period. To account for trap losses by mechanisms
other than detachment, alternate data cycles measure the
trap retention ratio in the absence of laser light (shutter
closed). Thus the ratio of the fraction of ions surviv-
ing the interaction period with and without light yields
a fraction of ions surviving photodetachment, corrected
to ﬁrst order for background losses. The entire cycle is
repeated both with and without the parallel electric ﬁeld.

well above the trap eigenfrequency [40]. The single-mode
laser beam was directed through the ion trap aligned per-

pendicular to the ﬁelds.

In Fig. 5 we show a comparison of the experimental
and theoretical results [Eq. (20)] both with and without
the external electric ﬁeld. We plot the percentage of ions
surviving detachment as a function of the excess photon
energy above the electron aﬃnity, expressed as a laser
EA/~. The theoretical
frequency detuning ∆Ω = Ω
results with and without the electric ﬁeld are shown in
the solid and dotted lines, respectively. In each case the
initial threshold and subsequent cyclotron structure are
evident. As expected, due to the large number of pos-
sible transitions (Table I) the detailed features seen in
Fig. 1 are not easily recognized. Depending on the pres-
ence of the additional electric ﬁeld, the structure of both
the theory and experimental curves changes slightly. In
each case, addition of the ﬁeld diminishes the depth of
modulation in the detachment ratio, particularly at the
ﬁrst dip above the initial threshold. This dip corresponds
directly to the ﬁrst peak in the relative detachment cross
section shown in Fig. 1. This behavior is to be expected
from our theoretical analysis (see Fig. 2), and is also
qualitatively consistent with our semi-classical view of
the detachment process: the external electric ﬁeld pushes
the electron away from the core as the electron orbits in
the magnetic ﬁeld. The result is a diminished overlap of
the electron wave function with itself, yielding a reduced
cross section. Furthermore, we observe that addition of
the electric ﬁeld shifts the minimum of the ﬁrst dip in
the detachment ratio to slightly higher energy, as pre-
dicted also by the theory. Unfortunately, the details of
the experimental cross section could not be reproduced.
Examination of the high precision achieved in exper-

iments conducted with ion beams (see,
for example,
Ref. [10, 11]) might suggest that this work should be
carried out in a beam apparatus. We considered this
idea in depth, but found that combining all the neces-
sary ﬁeld components, along with particle detectors and
optical access, was technically unfeasible. Alternately,
the Penning ion trap’s size and geometric conﬁguration
lends itself ideally to superposition of the parallel ﬁelds.
Furthermore, the trap’s typical storage time allows for
lengthy optical interaction periods, and therefore greater
precision in the photon energy.

However, the electric ﬁeld perpendicular to the motion
of the ions and the external magnetic ﬁeld is of course
always present. Eﬀorts are currently underway to evapo-
ratively cool the trapped ion cloud. Future experiments
at lower ion temperatures are expected to yield greater
contrast in the results with the addition of the parallel
electric ﬁeld. Also, future experiments with π-polarized
light (parallel to the ﬁelds) will minimize the number of
allowed Zeeman transitions and should give a clearer pic-
ture of the underlying Green function. Another possible
approach to diminish the number of Zeeman transitions
is to quench the detachment from the lowest three Zee-
man sublevels of the ion using a second laser. This will
require attention to the possibility of collisional redis-
tribution among the initial states, but again, this eﬀect
should be diminished with an evaporatively cooled ion
cloud.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated, theoretically and experimen-
from

tally, near-threshold s–wave photodetachment

atomic negative ions in parallel electric and magnetic
ﬁelds. Our fully quantum mechanical theory based on
the electron propagator allows us to calculate the tran-
sition rate in combined ﬁelds for a thermal ion cloud in
a convenient manner, leaving only a single integral to be
evaluated numerically. While showing agreement with
previous theoretical work for detachment from S− in a
purely magnetic ﬁeld, the theory predicts both a loss of
contrast in the detachment rate and a shift of the pho-
tocurrent maxima towards higher laser frequencies as a
consequence of the additional electric ﬁeld. We present
experimental observations of photodetachment from S−
in parallel ﬁelds that qualitatively agree with theoretical
expectations. Future work will focus on similar experi-
ments conducted with evaporatively cooled ions, where
eﬀects of the electric ﬁeld are expected to be more fully
evident.

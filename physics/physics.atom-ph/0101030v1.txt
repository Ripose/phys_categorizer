Density Functional Theory Studies of Magnetically Conﬁned

Fermi Gas∗

CHEN Yu-Jun, MA Hong Ru

A theory is developed for magnetically conﬁned Fermi gas at low tem-

perature based on the density functional theory. The theory is illustrated
by numerical calculation of density distributions of Fermi atoms 40K with pa-

rameters according to DeMarco and Jin’s experiment[Science, 285(1999)1703].

Our results are in good agreement with the experiment. To check the the-

ory, we also performed calculations using our theory at high temperature and

compared very well to the result of classical limit.

In a recent publication, DeMarco and Jin reported their work on Fermi atoms at low

×

temperature in conﬁned geometries. They employed an evaporative cooling strategy to
105 40K atoms to 0.5 of the Fermi temperature
cool a magnetically trapped gas of 7
TF . An Ioﬀe-Pritchard-type magnetic trap [2] provides a cylindrically symmetric, harmonic
potential with an axial frequency of ωz = 2π
19.5 Hz and a variable radial frequency.
The radial frequency, as well as the minimum magnetic ﬁeld, can be smoothly varied from
ωr = 2π
In the experiment presented by DeMarco and Jin, a single-component gas of the F = 9/2,
mF = 9/2 atoms is produced, where F is the total atomic spin and mF is its magnetic
quantum number. The time-of-ﬂight image was taken by suddenly switching oﬀ the current

that provides the magnetic trapping ﬁeld, which allowed the gas to expand freely for 15 to 20

ms. The absorption shadow, generated by illumination of the expanded gas, was imaged onto

a charged-coupled device array. They detected the emergency of quantum degeneracy in a

trapped gas of Fermionic atoms and observed a non-classical momentum distribution and

found that the total energy of the gas is larger than the classical expectation. They observed

not only the momentum distribution but also the conﬁned gas itself, which approaches a

ﬁxed size as T approaches zero.

In this letter, we present a general theory of the low-temperature density proﬁle of an ideal

Fermi gas trapped within an arbitrary potential well. Then we give the results of numerical

calculation to compare to the experiment. The approach taken here is based on the density

functional theory (DFT) [4,5], which was ﬁrst introduced by Kohn and Hohenberg [6] in

the context of ground state energy of quantum systems. It was developed and extended to

excited states and to ﬁnite temperatures by some researchers and has become the eﬀective

ﬁrst principle calculational method for the electronic and structural properties of a large

variety of condensed matter systems. Considering a single-component system within an

external potential at T
= 0K, the DFT asserts that the true density distribution of a
system in an external ﬁeld V (r) is the one that leads to the minimum of the following
functional,

F [n(r)] = F0[n(r)] +

[V (r)

µ]

n(r)dr,

·

and the minimum is the the Helmholtz free energy of the system. Here µ is the chemical
potential in the above expression. While F0[n(r)] is a temperature dependent functional
of n(r) only, the dependence of F0[n(r)] on external potential V (r) is only through the
dependence of n(r) on V (r). This is a very strong statement which means that if we know
the functional form of F0[n(r)] we can get all the physical quantities of interest. For a given
external potential, the functional derivative of F [n(r)] with respect to n(r) should equals to
zero:

δF [n(r)]
δn(r)

= 0.

This gives an equation for n(r), and when n(r) is obtained from the solution of Eq. (2), we
substitute it back to (1) to get the free energy and other quantities can be obtained simply
by diﬀerential. It is hard to get the functional form of F0[n(r)], various approximations are
employed in practical calculations. One of the commonly used approximation is the local

density approximation(LDA) which usually gives excellent results to real systems. We use

here the LDA in our theory of conﬁned Fermi systems. In this approximation the functional
F0[n(r)] is assumed to be

F0[n(r)] =

drf0(n(r)).

Z

And we assume that the free energy density f0(n(r)) has also the same functional form as
the free energy of an uniform system of density n, i.e, f0(n) is the Helmholtz free energy
density of an uniform system with density n. Then we can obtain

where we have indicated the µ dependence of n which follows from Eq. (5). Once having
determined µ from Eq. (9) we substitute it back into Eq. (6) to get n(r). Oliva has developed
an approximate form of the Helmholtz free energy of the uniform system for diﬀerent regimes
of density [7]. However, in our theory such an expression of f0 with respect to n is not
required.

Now we use the conﬁning potential well, according to the experiment by DeMarco and

Jin, to calculate the density distributions of Fermi atoms.

FIG. 2. Atomic density as function of r with diﬀerent values of z for 40K atoms under magnetic

The particle density distributions are calculated by using the present method. Figures

1 and 2 are plots of the density as function of z and r for two diﬀerent temperatures. As

observed in the experiment that the conﬁned gas approaches a ﬁxed size, we calculated the
root-mean-square radius of the system and get rRM S = 0.7RF at T = 0.5TF and rRM S =
0.5RF at low temperature T = 0.05TF , where RF =
r [8,9]. These results are
coincident with the experiment, where they obtained rRM S = 0.6RF as T approaches zero
and rRM S = 0.9RF at T /TF = 0.5 [1] . The diﬀerence between theory and experiment may
due to the systematic uncertainty in T /TF within the experiment. To check the validity of
our method we calculated the case for T /TF = 2 with other conditions unchanged. At high
temperature (i.e., in the classical limit T >> TF ), we have [8]:

FIG. 3. Atomic density as function of r with diﬀerent values of z for 40K atoms under magnetic

conﬁnement. Parameters are the same as Fig. 1 except T = 2TF . The solid lines are calculations

from DFT as described in this work and dashed lines are from the Boltzmann distributions.

In summary we calculated the physical properties of the Fermi gas conﬁned within a

potential well at none-zero temperature. This method is based on the density functional
theory under local density approximation. The case of 40K atoms in a magnetic conﬁnement
is calculated and the result agrees with recent experiment. Here the interaction between

atoms is completely neglected and the study of eﬀect of interaction on the conﬁned Fermi

atomic gas is underway. Further studies of quantum degenerate Fermi gases in diﬀerent

conﬁnement and interactions are also the important and interesting subjects.

We have performed high resolution spectroscopy
of rubidium with a single mode continuous wave
distributed feedback (DFB) laser diode.
The
saturation spectrum of the D2-line of 85Rb and
87Rb was recorded with a resolution close to
the natural line width. The emission frequency
was actively stabilized to Doppler-free transitions
with a relative accuracy of better than 7 parts
in 109 using commercially available servo devices
only. An output power of 80 mW was suﬃcient
to allow for two-photon spectroscopy of the 5S-
5D-transition of 87Rb. Further, we report on the
spectral properties of the DFB diode, its tuning
range and its frequency modulation properties.
The line width of the diode laser, determined
with high resolution Doppler free two photon
spectroscopy, was 4 MHz without applying any
active stabilization techniques. For time scales
below 5 µs the line width drops below 2 MHz.

The commercial

introduction of single mode
quantum well
laser diodes about 15 years ago
has revolutionized high resolution spectroscopy of
atoms and molecules. While the spectral prop-
erties and the tunability of the pure diode chip
are not suﬃcient for many applications, a reliable
and useful device can be constructed by stabiliz-
ing the diode with optical feedback from an ex-
ternal grating [1, 2, 3]. Today, so-called exter-
nal cavity diode lasers (ECDLs) are commercially

1

available and widely used in numerous experiments
in the ﬁelds of quantum optics, ultra-cold atomic
and molecular quantum gases, high resolution spec-
troscopy, and metrology. Although highly supe-
rior to conventional laser systems in many aspects,
diode lasers still require considerable expertise for
alignment, frequency control and operation such
that the optical apparatus is still a critical part in
a typical experiment. In particular, for mode-hop
free tuning over a large frequency range, the Bragg
angle of the grating and the resonator length need
to be adjusted simultaneously to keep a longitu-
dinal mode resonant within the laser cavity. Al-
though mode-hop free tuning ranges in the order
of 100 GHz have been demonstrated with commer-
cially available ECDLs, the precise mechanical re-
alization of the pivot axis remains a challenge in
terms of engineering, adjustment and stability.

A semiconductor laser that oﬀers the tunability
of an external-cavity system without its mechani-
cal complexity is a Distributed Feed-Back (DFB)
diode [4]. In a DFB diode, a Bragg grating is in-
tegrated into the active section of the semiconduc-
tor. Wavelength tuning is realized by altering the
refractive index of the semiconductor, which can be
achieved by either changing the temperature or the
operating current. This type of laser has long been
used for telecommunication and can be regarded
as the optical analogue of a voltage controlled os-
cillator in radio frequency technology: the emit-
ted wavelength depends only on well controlled pa-
rameters in a robust and reproducible way. Whilst
DFB diodes at 1550 nm proved suitable for spec-

troscopy of hydrocarbons [5], spectroscopic mea-
surements with alkali atoms have hitherto required
second harmonic generation [6]. Recently, DFB
laser chips have become available at various wave-
lengths near the D1- and D2-lines of alkali atoms.
In this article we present a detailed test of a DFB
laser for spectroscopy of the rubidium D2-line and
the two-photon 5S-5D transition. It turns out that
with low noise driving electronics its performance
equals that of grating stabilized diode lasers in al-
most all aspects. By reducing the complexity of
optical experiments, this diode laser opens new pos-
sibilities for upcoming projects that require auto-
mated operation, e.g. optical clocks in satellites or
air-borne experiments in atmospheric physics.

For the measurements presented here, a DL 100
laser system and control electronics from TOP-
TICA Photonics were used. Experiments were car-
ried out with two diﬀerent DFB diodes with emis-
sion ranges of 779.1-781.0 nm and 777.8 nm-780.3
nm, respectively. The diodes were mounted into a
‘ColdPack’ housing [7], a TO-3 style package with
integrated thermistor and four thermoelectric cool-
ers. The ColdPack permitted rapid and ﬂexible
control of the diode temperature within a range of
-10. . .+40 ◦C and sweep times of up to 3.5 K/s. A
‘Bias-Tee’ was included in the laser head to allow
for radio frequency modulation of the laser current
and the generation of sidebands within the laser
spectrum. For frequency stabilization, a lock-in
regulator was employed. The laser beam was colli-
mated by an aspheric lens (NA = 0.55). The laser
beam proﬁle was shaped from elliptical to circular
by an anamorphic prism pair that compressed the
long axis by a factor of three. A 60 dB optical isola-
tor prevented optical feedback into the laser diode.
The coarse spectral properties of the DFB laser
were characterized with a commercial grating spec-
trometer (AQ-6315A Optical Spectrum Analyzer,
Ando Electric) and a high precision wavelength me-
ter (HighFinesse-Angstrom WS/Ultimate, absolute
accuracy 30 MHz).

Fig. 1 shows the spectrum of the DFB diode at
diﬀerent temperatures as measured with the grat-
ing spectrometer at 50 pm resolution.
It reveals
a background of ampliﬁed spontaneous emission
(ASE) which is suppressed by 37 . . . 41 dB relative
to the coherent part of the diode radiation. At low
temperatures, a slight increase in ASE is observed
on the short-wavelength side of the spectrum. This

diﬀerent diode temperatures of 0.0 ◦C, 16.6 ◦C and
30 ◦C (from left to right). The resolution of the

results from the diﬀerence in the temperature in-
duced frequency shift of the internal grating, which
determines the lasing wavelength, and of the gain
proﬁle of the semiconductor which is responsible
for the ASE. More speciﬁcally, the resonance wave-
length of the grating changes by approximately 0.05
nm/K (see below), while the gain spectrum varies
at a rate of ∼ 0.2 nm/K. Thus, the resonant wave-
length shifts to the side of the gain spectrum, which
eventually limits the accessible wavelength range of
the DFB diode.

The tuning range of the laser was determined
with the wavelength meter. The output frequency
can either be changed by varying the operating cur-
rent of the diode or the temperature of the chip
housing. The modulation of the current changes
both the carrier density and the internal tempera-
ture of the semiconductor chip. The thermal eﬀect
is comparably slow and becomes less relevant with
increasing tuning rates. This is shown in Fig. 2,
which plots the scan width (i.e.
the shift of the
emission frequency) as a function of tuning speed.
The diﬀerent symbols refer to modulation ampli-
tudes of 59 mA, 42 mA, 21 mA and 10 mA, re-
spectively. All measurements indicate an approx-
imately logarithmic reduction of the scan width
with increasing modulation frequency. More specif-
ically, the tuning rate [GHz/mA] amounts to ≈ 1.2
GHz/mA at slow modulation frequencies (f = 42

mHz) and decreases to ≈ 0.7 GHz/mA at faster
modulation frequencies (f = 86 Hz). Moreover, the
tuning rate is independent of the modulation am-
plitude, i.e. at any ﬁxed modulation frequency, the
ratio of the scan widths in Fig. 2 reproduces pre-
cisely the ratio of the diﬀerent modulation ampli-
tudes employed. Generally, the comparatively large
tuning rates call for a low-noise current driver for
high resolution applications with laser line widths
in the 1 MHz range.

The thermal tuning characteristics are illustrated
in Fig. 3. The diode temperature was decreased
from 30 ◦C to -7.6 ◦C while the emission wavelength
was monitored with the wavelength meter. The
wavelength varied between 780.95 nm and 779.05
nm, with one mode-hop by 0.06 nm (30 GHz) oc-
curring at 780.7 nm. Single-mode emission was
maintained over a wavelength range of more than
1.6 nm (814 GHz). The data yield an average ther-
mal tuning rate of ∆ν / ∆T = - 25 GHz / K (+
0.05 nm / K).

For line width measurements, we used the setup
sketched in Fig. 4a. The laser beam was coupled
into a Fabry-Perot cavity consisting of two mirrors
spaced apart at a distance of 90 cm. The input
coupler (nominal reﬂectivity 99.6%) had a radius

to -7.6 ◦C. The mean thermal tuning rate is ∆ν /

ror (nominal reﬂectivity 99.8%) was plane. Mode
matching was accomplished by a lens (f = 1000
mm) placed 10 cm in front of the input coupler.
The transmitted light was detected by a fast photo
diode with a band width of 40 MHz. For saturation
spectroscopy of the rubidium D2 line, the setup was
modiﬁed as shown in Fig. 4b. The laser beam suc-
cessively passed a polarizing beam splitter (PBS),
a glass cell ﬁlled with rubidium vapor, an attenu-
ator (attenuation factor = 6), and a quarter wave
retardation plate before being retro reﬂected. The
probe beam, having passed the retardation plate
twice, was coupled out at the PBS and detected by
a fast photo diode.

For measurements of the 5S-5D two-photon tran-
sition (Fig. 4c), the attenuator and the retardation
plate were removed and the beam was focussed and
re-collimated by two lenses (f = 150 mm, distance
300 mm). The rubidium cell, placed at the focus,
was heated to ∼ 100 ◦C in order to increase the va-
por pressure and the 420 nm ﬂuorescence light from
the radiative cascade 5D-6P-5S[8, 9] was detected
with a photo multiplier.

For the line width measurement of the DFB laser,
the laser beam was coupled into the aforementioned
Fabry-Perot cavity (free spectral range 166 MHz,
estimated ﬁnesse > 500). The transmitted light
was focussed onto the fast photo diode. In order
to provide a frequency reference, side bands were
generated by applying a 20 MHz sinusoidal mod-
ulation to the laser current by means of a Bias-
Tee. In addition the operating current was linearly
modulated in order to scan the laser across the
resonance of the Fabry-Perot cavity. Fig 5 shows
the transmitted signal versus time. The velocity
of the scan can be determined from the position
of the sidebands. In the given example it amounts
to 30 MHz/ms. The 70 µs time interval for scan-
ning across the resonance corresponds to a laser line
FWHM of 2 MHz. However, the cavity transmis-
sion does not form a smooth resonance but rather
consists of several sharp needles with an individual
width of typically 0.5 µs each. These needles were
also observed when the laser frequency was scanned
without additional rf modulation. We have investi-
gated the width of these needles for diﬀerent scan-
ning rates between 30 MHz/ms and 2 GHz/ms. We
observed that independent of the scan speed, the
width of the resonance envelope remained constant

Figure 5: Transmission spectrum of the Fabry-
Perot cavity. The laser wavelength was scanned
at 30 MHz/ms. The spectrum consists of the main
resonance and two sidebands produced by 20 MHz
rf-modulation. The inset shows an enlarged view
of the main resonance.

in the frequency domain (2 MHz, line in ﬁg. 5)
while the width of the needles remained unchanged
in the time domain (0.5 µs). We then varied the
laser current and found a strong inﬂuence on the
line width. Starting with a rather broad (8 MHz)
line at 45 mA (output power P = 10 mW) the
line width decreased with increasing current and
reached a minimum for values between 60 and 80
mA (P = 35 mW). At higher currents the line width
increased again. We thus conclude that the ob-
served line width of the envelope is a technical line
width, which results from frequency ‘jumps’ of a
narrow laser line. The jumps may be due to spa-
tial hole burning, which leads to inhomogeneities
in the charge carrier density and consequently to
mode ﬂuctuations [10, 11]. The observed constant
needle width in the time domain is consistent with
a model for the laser spectrum that consists of a
very narrow frequency component which randomly
sweeps across the cavity resonance in a time inter-
val shorter than the cavity ﬁlling time. The ob-
served width of 0.5 µs corresponds to a cavity line
width of 300 kHz which agrees reasonably well with
the expected line width of 200 kHz. This value also
deﬁnes an upper limit for the laser spectrum at time
intervals shorter than 0.5 µs. For intervals of up to
5 µs the frequency excursion of the jumping com-

of the diode’s driver current. The inset shows a
close-up of the Fg = 2 transition of 87Rb. All six
Doppler-free peaks are resolved (from left to right:

over Fe = 3&1, Fe = 2, cross-over Fe = 2&1, and
Fe = 1).

ponent remains within 2 MHz as can be seen from
the envelope. From spectroscopic data (see below)
one can infer that the excursions always stay within
a range of 4 MHz.

In order to test the laser in a spectroscopic ap-
plication, we recorded the saturation spectra of
the rubidium D2 line (Fig 6). The intensities of
pump and probe beam were 5 mW and 150 µW re-
spectively, the beam diameters were approximately
1mm. The spectra were acquired by scanning the
current of the diode. The current variation of 6
mA resulted in a corresponding intensity change of
10% within the scan range of 8.4 GHz. The laser
power varied nearly proportional with the current
as shown in the ﬁgure. The four Doppler broad-
ened lines correspond to excitation of the two ru-
bidium isotopes 85Rb and 87Rb with two hypeﬁne
ground states each: 87Rb (Fg = 1), 85Rb (Fg = 2),
85Rb (Fg = 3), and 87Rb (Fg = 2). Their half
widths of 700 MHz reﬂect the gas temperature of
300K. Each resonance features several Doppler-free

peaks, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6 for the 87Rb
Fg = 2 transition. The measured line width of the
hyperﬁne transitions and crossover-resonances is 9
MHz, which is close to the natural line width of 6
MHz.

A lock-in servo loop was used to stabilize the
laser frequency to Doppler-free D2-line transitions
from the 87Rb (Fg = 2) ground state. The DFB
laser was successively locked to the transition Fg =
2 → Fe = 3 and the two cross-over resonances
Fg = 2 → Fe = 2&3 and Fg = 2 → Fe = 1&3 while
the wavelength was recorded with the wavelength
meter. Table 1 compares precision data taken from
literature [12] with our recorded values. The de-
viation of the measured frequencies from the liter-
ature values of approximately 10 MHz is well be-
low the accuracy of the wavelength meter which
was calibrated with a stabilized helium-neon laser
at 632,99 nm. With the laser being locked to the
respective resonances, values between 1.4 and 2.5
MHz were measured for the standard deviation of
the frequency. This translates into a relative fre-
quency stability of 3-6 parts in 109. However, as
the resolution of the utilized wavelength lies within
the same range, the actual frequency stability can
be assumed to be even better.

The 5S-5D two-photon transition of rubidium of-
fers a narrow line width (∼500 kHz) [9] due to the
long lifetime of the 5D state. To probe this tran-
sition we focussed the laser beam into the spec-
troscopy cell and modulated the wavelength by
scanning the operating current. Fig. 7 shows the
ﬂuorescence signal, measured with a photo multi-
plier, after excitation of the 5S1/2, Fg = 2 → 5D5/2
transition of 87Rb. Spectra a) - c) were recorded
with scan speeds of 23 MHz/ms, 48 MHz/ms and
463 MHz/ms, respectively. Also shown is a ﬁt curve
of the four Lorentzian line proﬁles. The x-axis of
the plot is scaled to the frequency detuning using
the frequency separation between the Fe = 4 and
Fe = 2 peaks. At slow scan speeds (a), the res-
onance lines are decomposed into multiple peaks
due to jitter of the laser frequency. As observed in
the Fabry-Perot spectrum (Fig. 5), the width of
each needle within the time domain does not de-
pend on the scanning speed. By scanning faster
(b), the width of the line envelope remains un-
changed, while the number of needles per resonance
decreases. At even faster scan speeds (c), each res-
onance consists of only one needle. The frequency

Figure 7: Hyperﬁne spectrum of the two-photon
transition 5S1/2 (Fg = 2) to 5D5/2 (Fe = 4 to 1)
of 87Rb. The graph shows spectra acquired with
diﬀerent scan speeds of 23 MHz/ms, 48 MHz/ms,
and 463 MHz/ms, respectively. At slow scan fre-
quencies, the resonance lines broaden and are suc-
cessively decomposed into multiple peaks resulting
from high-frequent wavelength hops of the DFB
diode. Also shown are best-ﬁt curves of the data.
The line width determined from a Lorentzian ﬁt is
given for each resonance.

hops now result in a displacement of the line in
frequency space. The ﬁt curves of the peak struc-
ture in Fig. 7 can be employed to investigate the
technical line width of the DFB diode as a func-
tion of scan velocity. The minimum FWHM width
of the measured lines is approximately 1.5-2 MHz.
This value is broader than the natural line width
of 500 kHz, and agrees with the previous measure-
ments with the Fabry-Perot cavity (Fig. 5). At
even higher scan speeds, the width of the spectral
signatures appears to be Fourier limited, leading to
line re-broadening.

In summary, it can be stated that the type of
laser described here is very suitable for almost all
standard high resolution applications in alkali spec-
troscopy including laser cooling and optical ma-
nipulation of ultra cold atoms. The high output
power allows for eﬃciently driving nonlinear pro-
cesses and the spectral width of the bare chip lies
well within the natural line width of the D1 and
D2-transitions. The relatively low frequency noise
of the laser spectrum probably allows for further
reducing the spectral width to well below 100 kHz
with standard servo loops that link the injection
current to an error signal derived from an atomic
spectrum or a stable resonator. The absence of any
critical mechanical or optical components in the
laser’s control system permits a very reliable and
stable operation. Together with its extremely large
mode-hop free tuning range these properties will
probably allow for the construction of compact and
sophisticated optical radiation sources that trans-
fer the reliability and performance known from ra-
diofrequency technology into the optical domain.

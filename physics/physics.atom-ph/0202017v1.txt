Absolute total electron-ion recombination rate coeﬃcients of argonlike Sc3+(3s23p6) ions have
been measured for relative energies between electrons and ions ranging from 0 to 45 eV. This
energy range comprises all dielectronic recombination resonances attached to 3p→3d and 3p→4s
excitations. A broad resonance with an experimental width of 0.89 ± 0.07 eV due to the 3p53d2 2F
intermediate state is found at 12.31 ± 0.03 eV with a small experimental evidence for an asymmetric
line shape. From R-Matrix and perturbative calculations we infer that the asymmetric line shape
may not only be due to quantum mechanical interference between direct and resonant recombination
channels as predicted by Gorczyca et al. [Phys. Rev. A 56, 4742 (1997)], but may partly also be
due to the interaction with an adjacent overlapping DR resonance of the same symmetry. The
overall agreement between theory and experiment is poor. Diﬀerences between our experimental
and our theoretical resonance positions are as large as 1.4 eV. This illustrates the diﬃculty to
accurately describe the structure of an atomic system with an open 3d-shell with state-of-the-art
theoretical methods. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that a relativistic theoretical treatment of the system
under study is mandatory since the existence of experimentally observed strong 3p53d2 2D and
3p53d4s 2D resonances can only be explained when calculations beyond LS-coupling are carried out.

INTRODUCTION

Dielectronic recombination (DR)

e− + Aq+

is a two-step electron-ion collision process, where in a ﬁrst
step a multiply-excited intermediate state is created by a
resonant dielectronic capture (DC, inverse Auger) and in
a second step that intermediate state decays by photon
emission. Another possible recombination mechanism is
radiative recombination (RR)

which by emission of a photon directly proceeds to a non-
autoionizing state of the recombined ion. When both the

initial and the ﬁnal state including the photons emit-
ted are the same, RR and DR are indistinguishable and
they may interfere, with the signature of interference be-
ing an asymmetric DR resonance line proﬁle in the en-
ergy diﬀerential recombination cross section [1, 2, 3, 4].
Asymmetric line shapes have experimentally so far been
observed only in partial recombination cross sections of
highly charged uranium ions [5]. Such an observation
is interesting from a fundamental point of view since it
questions the widely used independent processes approx-
imation (IPA) in the calculation of RR+DR recombina-
tion cross sections.

One motivation for investigating the recombination of
argonlike Sc3+(3s23p6) ions with free electrons is the the-
oretical predication by Gorczyca et al. [6] of a strongly
asymmetric line shape for the 3p53d2 2F DR resonance
caused by interference between the recombination path-

ways

Theoretically they predicted a Sc2+(3s23p53d2 2F) reso-
nance position of 14.6 eV and a width of 1.8 eV. The large
width of the resonance is explained by the fact that it de-
cays predominantly via a very fast Super-Coster-Kronig
transition (reverse of the horizontal arrow in Eq. 3) with
a calculated rate of 2.84

1015 s−1.

A ﬁrst attempt to experimentally determine the line
shape of the Sc2+(3p53d2 2F) resonance by measuring the
total Sc3+ recombination rate coeﬃcient at a heavy-ion
storage ring failed due to the rather large statistical un-
certainty of that measurement [7] (see also Sec. II). How-
ever, distinct diﬀerences between theoretical and experi-
mental peak positions were found and attributed to the
fact that a correct theoretical description of the highly
correlated 3p53d2 conﬁgurations is extremely diﬃcult.
Using Cowan’s [8] atomic structure code we ﬁnd that the
Sc2+(3p53d2) conﬁguration gives rise to 45 ﬁne struc-
ture components distributed over an energy interval of
about 20 eV width. In order to account for correlation
eﬀects Hansen and Quinet [9] considered the interaction
of 10 initial and 16 ﬁnal conﬁgurations in the calcula-
tion of 3p63d
3p53d2 transition energies in Ca+. Still
3p53d2 2F) transi-
their result for the Ca+(3p63d 2D
tion energy deviates 0.76 eV from the experimental result
(29.34 eV) determined by photoionization of metastable
Ca+(3p63d) ions [10]. This again illustrates the diﬃculty
to accurately describe inner shell transitions in atomic or
ionic systems with open 3d-subshells. In this situation
DR measurements (and complementary photoionization
measurements) can yield valuable spectroscopic informa-
tion on such systems.

Here we present new experimental as well as theoretical
results for the total Sc3+ recombination rate coeﬃcient.
The experiment is a twofold extension of our previous
work [7]. The new data have much smaller statistical
uncertainties and they are extended to the much wider
energy range 0–45 eV (previous range 12.2–18.2 eV) in-
cluding all DR series limits due to 3p
4s
core excitations.

We have also carried out both nonperturbative and
perturbative calculations for the e− + Sc3+ photore-
combination. The nonperturbative method is based on
the rigorous continuum-bound transition theory and the
close-coupling R-matrix approach [11]. The perturbative
evaluation is a treatment including radiative recombina-
tion (RR), dielectronic recombination (DR) and their in-
terference. Our calculations reveal that three adjacent
resonances mask the low energy side of the 3p53d2 2F
resonance. This makes the experimental observation of
the predicted [6] interference between the 3p53d2(3F) 2F
DR resonance and the continuous RR cross section dif-
ﬁcult. Moreover, we ﬁnd that several experimental DR

2

resonances not reproduced by the LS-coupling R-matrix
calculations of Gorczyca et al. [6] are due to relativistic
eﬀects.

In Sec. II and Sec. III we outline our experimental and
theoretical methods. Experimental and theoretical re-
sults are presented and discussed in Secs. IV A and IV B,
respectively. In Sec. IV C possible origins for the asym-
metry of the 3p53d2(3F) 2F DR resonance are explored
by theoretically considering interference between DR and
RR as well as interference between overlapping DR reso-
nances. Our main results are summarized in Sec. V.

II. EXPERIMENT

The experiment was performed at the heavy ion stor-
age ring TSR of the Max Planck Institut f¨ur Kern-
physik (MPIK) in Heidelberg. Details of the experimen-
tal setup and the data reduction procedures can be found
in Refs. [12, 13, 14, 15]. The 45Sc3+ ions were accelerated
by the MPIK tandem booster facility to their ﬁnal energy
and subsequently injected into the TSR. The rather low
charge to mass ratio of q/A = 1/15 leads to the rather
unfavorable condition (see below) that the ion energy
is limited by the maximum bending power of the TSR
dipole magnets. With the maximum magnetic rigidity of
Bρ = 1.4 Tm the highest accessible ion energy can be
calculated from

420 keV/u. In the storage ring the circulating
to Ei/A
18.9 MeV Sc3+ ion beam was merged with the magnet-
ically guided electron beam of the electron cooler. Dur-
ing electron-cooling, the electrons have to move with the
same average velocity as the ions. This condition deﬁnes
the cooling energy Ec = (Ei/A)(me/u)
230 eV. In or-
der to increase the phase space density of the already
stored ions and thereby free phase space for the next in-
jection pulse from the accelerator, electron-cooling was
allowed to be eﬀective for 2 seconds after each injection
of ions. These ‘ecool-stacking’ cycles [16] were repeated
three times until the accumulated ion current stabilized
at values of up to 5 µA. Before data taking was started
a prolonged cooling interval of 5 s after the last injec-
tion allowed the ion beam to shrink to a ﬁnal diameter
of about 2 mm as veriﬁed with a beam proﬁle monitor
based on residual gas ionization [17].

During the measurement the electron energy Ee in the
laboratory frame was stepped through a preset range of
values diﬀerent from Ec thus introducing non-zero rela-
tive energies

eﬃciency as a function of cooler voltage on a single par-
ticle detector [18] located behind the ﬁrst dipole magnet
downstream of the electron cooler. The dipole magnet
bends the circulating Sc3+ ion beam onto a closed orbit
and separates the recombined Sc2+ ions from that orbit.
In between two measurement steps the cooler voltage was
ﬁrst set back to the cooling value in order to maintain
the ion beam quality and then set to a reference value
at Erel = 45 eV which is chosen to lead to a relative
velocity where the electron-ion recombination coeﬃcient
is only due to a negligible RR rate. Under this condi-
tion the recombination rate measured at the reference
point monitors the background signal. Choosing short
time intervals of 10 ms duration for dwelling on the mea-
surement, cooling and reference voltages ensured that the
experimental environment did not change signiﬁcantly in
between signal and background measurement. An addi-
tional interval of 1.5 ms after each change of the cooler
voltage allowed the power supplies to reach the preset
values before data taking was started.

At the rather low ion energy of 420 keV/u the cross
section for electron capture from residual gas molecules
is estimated — taking the measured residual gas com-
position into account and using a semi-empirical formula
[19] for the charge capture cross section σ(capt) — to be
10−18 cm2. Electron capture
as large as σ(capt) = 4
from residual gas molecules is therefore expected to con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to the measured recombination sig-
nal as a background even at the TSR residual gas pres-
10−11 mbar. This already proved to be
sure of only 5
all the more the case in a previous TSR experiment with
Sc3+ ions [7] where due to a technical defect in one of the
TSR dipole power supplies a reduced maximum rigidity
of only Bρ
1.2 Tm had been available. Consequently,
the ion energy had been limited to 300 keV/u. Because
of the rapid increase of σ(capt) with decreasing ion energy
and because the experiment had been carried out in early
summer, i. e., close to a maximum in the slight seasonal
variation of the TSR residual gas pressure, the measured
signal to background ratio had been of the order of 1/100.
Under these conditions the Sc3+ recombination rate co-
eﬃcient could only be measured over a limited energy
range with large statistical uncertainties. In the present
measurements, that were carried out in December 2000,
the signal to background ratio was a factor of about 10
higher as compared to the previous experiment.

≈

The electron-ion recombination coeﬃcient α(Erel) is
obtained as the background-subtracted recombination
count rate normalized to the electron current and to the
number of stored ions [12]. The estimated systematical
uncertainties are 15% for the absolute value of the mea-
sured rate coeﬃcient and less than 2% for the relative
energy in the energy range under study.

III. THEORY

A. Nonperturbative approach of continuum-bound
transitions

Starting from the rigorous continuum-bound transition
theory, Davies and Seaton [20] discussed the process of
emission of radiation into the optical continuum due to
radiative capture of an electron by an ion and derived
a general formalism including radiation damping. The
details of their formalism and our numerical scheme for
application can be found in Ref. [20] and Ref. [11], re-
spectively. Nevertheless, a brief review of the formalism
and our method follows.

Using the close-coupling R-matrix approach (see [11]
for details) we start from a treatment of the electron-ion
collision process that neglects any interaction with the
radiation ﬁeld. The resulting wave functions are used
as a basis for setting up equations including the interac-
tion with the radiation ﬁeld in the approximation that
only the electric-dipole terms are retained and that the
radiation ﬁeld is restricted to one-photon and no-photon
states. The exact solutions for the probability amplitudes
of the time-dependent matrix equations involved can be
obtained by the application of a Laplace transform. They
are expressed in terms of a scattering matrix χ with the
partitioning

χ =

(cid:18)

χee χep
χpe χpp

(cid:19)

with χee representing the submatrix for electron-electron
scattering allowing for radiative decays, χep that for pho-
toionization, χpe that for electron capture with the emis-
sion of a photon, and χpp that for photon-photon scat-
tering. χee and χpe are written as

χee = S[1
χpe =

2π2D(1 + Z)−1D†],

2πi(1 + Z)−1D†,

respectively, where S is the usual electron-electron scat-
tering matrix in the absence of interaction with radiation
ﬁelds, and D is the reduced dipole matrix (D† denotes
its hermitian conjugate) with its matrix element in the
form

where α is the ﬁne-structure constant, ω is the photon
ri is the dipole

electrons. The quantum numbers γJ and γ′J ′, respec-
tively, specify the continuum and bound states of the
atomic system, and J(J ′) are the total angular momenta.
The wave function of the continuum electron is normal-
ized per unit hartree. In Eqs. 7 and 8 the matrix

notes the total energy of the ion+photon system.
In
the usual ﬁrst-order theory damping is neglected and
2πiD. For the calculation of the PR cross sec-
χpe =
tion with damping we employ the numerical method de-
veloped by Zhao et al. [11] for the evaluation of the prin-
cipal value of the integral appearing in Eq. 10.

−

In the present calculation the parameters for the 1s, 2s,
2p, 3s, 3p orbitals of scandium were taken from the com-
pilation of Clementi and Roetti [21], and the 3d orbital
was optimized on the 3p53d 1,3Po, 1,3Do, 1,3Fo states
(weighted) by using the CIV3 code of Hibbert [22]. We
also evaluate PR cross sections for further target states
including 4s, 4p, 4d orbitals. All these orbitals were opti-
mized in a way similar to the 3d orbital. The symmetries
2S+1Lπ with L
5 were included in our calculations.
Here, S and L are the total spin and orbital angular mo-
mentum quantum numbers, respectively, and π denotes
the parity. In our calculation we included conﬁgurations
of odd parity only, since these are expected to lead to the
dominant resonances in the energy region of our primary
interest around the 3p53d2(3F) 2F resonance.

B. Perturbation theory

On the basis of the principle of detailed balance, the
photorecombination (PR) cross sections (in atomic units)
from an initial continuum state j to a ﬁnal bound state
f may be written in the form [23]

σPR
jf =

where gj and gf are the statistical weights of the initial
ion core and the ﬁnal recombined ion, ω and ǫ are the
photon energy and the free electron energy in hartrees,
and σPI
f j denotes the photoionization (PI) cross section
from state f to state j. In ﬁrst order perturbation treat-
ment it is

where Mf j is the PI matrix element of the corresponding
transition with the continuum state being normalized per

conﬁguration-interaction theory [24], the perturbative PI
matrix element Mf j in low orders may be written in the

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Experimental results

Fig. 1 shows the measured Sc3+(3s23p6 1S) recombi-
nation rate coeﬃcient. The most prominent feature is
the peaklike structure around Erel = 40 eV. It can be
attributed to mainly unresolved high n Rydberg DR
resonances attached to 3p53d 1P and 3p54s 1,3P core
excitations. Vertical lines indicate DR resonance po-
sitions E(n) as calculated with the Rydberg formula
E(n) = E(
= 13.606 eV, q = 3,
)

and the series limits E(
) taken from Tab. I. It should
be noted that we do not observe Rydberg resonances to
arbitrary high n, since recombined Sc2+(3p6 nl) ions in
weakly bound high n states are ﬁeld-ionized by motional
electric ﬁelds in the charge-analyzing dipole magnet and
therefore do not reach the recombination detector. Ap-

ﬁcient. Vertical
lines denote resonance positions of the
3p54s 1P nl and 3p53d 1P nl Rydberg series of DR resonances.
Vertical arrows denote possible positions of further 3p53d se-
ries limits (see Tab. I). The insets enlarge the spectrum at low
energies. Diﬀerent energy intervals were measured for diﬀer-
ent time durations and therefore exhibit diﬀerent statistical
uncertainties. The rise of the recombination-rate coeﬃcient
towards Erel = 0 eV is due to RR. The full line approaching
α(Erel) = 0 towards higher energies is the total hydrogenic
RR rate coeﬃcient (see text).

of our apparatus that takes into account the radiative
decay of high Rydberg states on their way from the elec-
tron cooler to the charge-analyzing magnet as well as
state-selective ﬁeld-ionization probabilities [15] we esti-
mate the highest detected Rydberg state to be approxi-
mately n = 20.

In principle, Rydberg series attached to further 3p53d
core excitations (Tab. I) could have been expected to
be visible. The respective core-excitation energies are
marked by vertical arrows in Fig. 1. However, no strong
DR resonances belonging to such series are observed. Ap-
parently, only dipole allowed (under LS-coupling con-
ditions) 1S
1P core excitations give rise to strong
DR channels. This has already been observed for iso-
electronic Ti4+ ions [26] where DR proceeds almost exclu-
sively via resonances attached to 3p53d 1P excitations.
In contrast to the present ﬁnding for Sc3+, in the DR
spectrum of Ti4+ no DR resonances due to 3p
4s exci-
tations were found. One strong hint to the origin of this
diﬀerence is the fact that in Sc3+ the 3p
4s excitation
energies are about 1 eV lower than the 3p53d 1P excita-
tion energy (Tab. I), while in Ti4+ they are higher by up
to 6 eV. Although being iso-electronic Sc3+ and Ti4+ do
have a markedly diﬀerent structure.

→

→

The recombination rate coeﬃcient rises sharply to-
wards zero relative energy (lower inset of Fig. 1). This
rise is due to RR. The RR rate coeﬃcient is rather small
as can be expected from the fact that RR into the K, L,
M1 and M2,3 shells of argonlike Sc3+ is not possible. This
is in contrast to e. g. bare Li3+ ions where these channels
yield the major contribution (43% at Erel = 10−6 eV)
to the total hydrogenic RR cross section [27] summed up
to n = 20. The hydrogenic total Sc3+ rate coeﬃcient,

quantum number n = 20 convoluted with the experi-
mental electron-energy distribution (see e. g. Ref. [15]),
is plotted as the full line in the lower inset of Fig. 1.
It agrees with the experimental curve within the experi-
mental uncertainties. In spite of the long measuring time
of 60 hours, in particular in the energy range of 8–17 eV,
the statistical uncertainty did not become low enough to
bring out all structures. At the present level of statis-
tical uncertainty it cannot be decided whether the faint
structures in the energy range 1–7.5 eV are due to weak
DR resonances or due to unaccounted background mod-
ulations.

The DR resonances visible in the upper inset of Fig. 1
are due to 3p53d2 and 3p53d 4l doubly excited conﬁgura-
tions. These conﬁgurations are considerably shifted down
in energy as compared to the Rydberg energies shown by
vertical lines in Fig. 1 and the energies of the various
terms must be taken from detailed calculations. As al-
ready mentioned in the introduction the terms belonging
to the 3p53d2 conﬁguration straddle an energy range of
about 20 eV. Also the 3p53d 4l conﬁgurations can be ex-
pected to be subject to strong ﬁne structure interactions
and hence to be spread out over several electron volts.
The energy range between about 8 and 26 eV (upper in-
set in Fig. 1) was searched preferentially in order to de-
tect the broad 3p53d2 2F Super-Coster-Kronig resonance
predicted by theory. The measurement reproduces the
strong double peak structure near 15 eV found already
in the previous experiment [7] (scan range 12–18 eV) but
now also reveals considerable additional structure both
above and below these peaks. While much of this struc-
ture seems to arise from a superposition of several nar-
row peaks, a single broad resonance (with some narrower
structure superimposed on its low energy slope) seems to
dominate the recombination rate near 12.3 eV. This sig-
nal bears strong similarity with the predicted 3p53d2 2F
Super-Coster-Kronig resonance [6] and we take this fea-
ture as a key to assigning a considerable part of the ob-
served spectrum. This interpretation is also supported by
the argument that for the isoelectronic system Ti4+ [26]
the 3p53d2 2F resonance was observed about 3 eV below
the prediction obtained by the same theoretical approach
[28], so here a position of

12 eV can be expected.

A closeup of the experimental spectrum is shown in
Fig. 2, where the resonances in the energy range 10.9–
16.5 eV have been ﬁtted by either Lorentzian line proﬁles

jor source of uncertainty beyond the errors given is the
background from collisions with residual gas molecules.
Under the conditions of the present experiment the back-
ground causes the major fraction of the measured recom-
bination count rate (see Sec. II). A subtraction of this
high background level from the measured signal is dif-
ﬁcult, especially, if changes of the residual gas pressure
have occurred on the time scale of the switching between
signal and background measurement. In this case a small
fraction of the background may not have been properly
subtracted possibly leading, e. g., to the nonzero recombi-
nation signal in the energy range 15.6–17 eV. In principle,
this signal might also be caused by a group of weak DR-
resonances, however, this assumption is not supported by
our theoretical calculations (see below). When allowing a
constant background level as an additional free parame-
ter in the ﬁt a considerably diﬀerent asymmetry parame-

The signiﬁcance of our ﬁt result for the asymmetry pa-
rameter may also be assessed by ﬁtting the 3p53d2 2F res-
onance with a symmetric Lorentzian instead of an asym-
metric Fano line shape. From such a Lorentzian ﬁt we
obtain a χ2 value that is higher by only 5% as compared
to the Fano ﬁt, i. e., the experimental evidence for an
asymmetric line shape is not very strong.

Fig. 3 shows the comparison of the present experimen-
tal result with the theoretical result of Gorczyca et al.
[6] in the region of the 3p53d2 2F resonance. As already
inferred from our previous work [7] the theoretical reso-
nance positions do not match the experimental ones. For
the comparison presented in Fig. 3 the theoretical en-
ergy scale has been shifted by 2.2 eV in order to match
the experimental position of the broad 3p53d2 2F res-
onance. Moreover, the absolute theoretical rate coeﬃ-
cient has been normalized to the experimental height of
this resonance by a multiplication factor of 0.63. After
these adjustments a basic similarity between predicted
and measured spectrum is found. In particular, a broad
feature is observed strongly resembling the calculated
3p53d2 2F resonance. However, in the experimental spec-

FIG. 3: Comparison of the measured Sc3+ rate coeﬃcient
with the theoretical result of Gorczyca et al. [6] (full curve) in
the region of the 3p53d2 2F resonance. The theoretical peak
designations are given. The theoretical rate coeﬃcient has
been shifted by 2.2 eV to lower energies and multiplied by 0.63
in order to obtain agreement with the measured 3p53d2 2F
resonance position and height.

trum considerably more resonances are visible than in the
theoretical one. The theoretically predicted single peaks
at 11.6 and 15.1 eV appear to be split into two compo-
nents. Also, the predicted relative resonance strengths
deviate from the experimental ﬁndings. The theoretical
3p53d2 2P peak at 15.1 eV is much smaller than the ex-
perimental doublet.

B. Theoretical results

The result of our LS-coupling–R-Matrix calculation of
the total Sc3+ PR cross section including damping is plot-
ted in Fig. 4a. It can be noticed that there is a very wide
resonance at about 13.6 eV. As already predicted by Gor-

state. However, our resonance energy is by about 1 eV
closer to the experimental value of 12.29 eV (see Tab. II)
than that of Gorczyca et al. This diﬀerence originates
from the use of diﬀerent sets of basis functions in both
calculations. Table III lists measured and theoretical
resonance energies including further theoretical results
[29, 30]. The relatively large diﬀerences between the var-
ious theoretical results illustrates again the diﬃculty to
exactly describe the many-electron atomic system under
consideration.

In order to be able to more accurately compare the
theoretical result with the measured merged-beams rate
coeﬃcient we convoluted the R-matrix cross section with
the experimental electron energy distribution function,
that can be parameterized by the longitudinal and trans-
verse (with respect to the electron beam direction) elec-

FIG. 5: Comparison of the measured Sc3+ rate coeﬃcient

theory) in the region of the 3p53d2(3F) 2F resonance. The
theoretical peak designations are given. The theoretical rate

tron beam temperatures Tk and T⊥, respectively [12].
For the convolution result displayed in Fig. 4b we have
used kBTk = 0.15 meV (cf., Fig. 2) and kBT⊥ = 10 meV.
Comparing with the experimental data in Fig. 1 we ﬁnd
that the R-matrix calculation does not reproduce the ex-
periment in every detail. For example, the calculated
resonance peaks in the energy range 7–17 eV are too
high, whereas those beyond 19 eV are too low. More-
over, some of the observed peaks at lower energies are not
reproduced by the R-matrix calculation. The disagree-
ment at high energies can be traced back to the neglect
of even-parity conﬁgurations and to the neglect of rela-
tivistic eﬀects by restricting the R-Matrix calculation to
LS-coupling. This also explains the missing of peaks at
lower energies. Using Cowan’s code [8] for the calcula-
tion of DR resonances in the framework of perturbation
theory (Sec. III B) we ﬁnd that due to relativistic eﬀects
(mainly spin-orbit interaction) also LS-forbidden excita-
tions to 3p53d2(3F) 2D as well as to 3p53d(1D)4s 2D and
3p53d(3D)4s 2D doubly excited states may contribute to
the PR cross section. It should be emphasized that res-
onances arising from relativistic eﬀects have in general
small Auger widths if the atomic number Z is not large.
As has been explained in some detail by Zhao and Shirai
[31] they, nevertheless, may still play an important role
in recombination if their radiative lifetime is of the order
of the radiative lifetimes of the dominant DR resonances.
As shown in Fig. 5, a much better agreement with
the experimental data is achieved when the the 2D reso-
nances mediated by spin-orbit eﬀects are taken into ac-
count in addition to the R-Matrix cross section. For
the generation of the incoherent sum of the R-Matrix

we have used the 2D Auger and radiative rates as cal-
culated by Cowan’s code. The resonance energy, how-
ever, has been determined by using the experimentally
observed energy splittings between the 2D resonances and
neighboring resonances obtained from R-Matrix theory.
For example, the experiment yields 3p53d2(3P) 2P and
3p53d2(3F) 2D resonance energies of 14.8 and 15.3 eV,
respectively (Tab. II). The level diﬀerence equals 0.5 eV.
Since our R-matrix calculation yields a 3p53d2(3P) 2P
resonance energy of 16.4 eV, we chose 16.9 eV to be the
3p53d2(3F) 2D resonance energy. Moreover, for the com-
parison in Fig. 5 the theoretical merged-beams rate co-
eﬃcient was multiplied by a factor 0.55 and shifted by
1.13 eV to lower energies. The diﬀerence between exper-
imental and theoretical cross sections of nearly a factor 2

C. Line shape of the 3p53d2(3F) 2F resonance

Clearly,

the theoretical

line shape of the broad
3p53d2(3F) 2F resonance is asymmetric. As already men-
tioned in the introduction, Gorczyca et al.
[6] have
attributed this asymmetry to interference between RR
and DR pathways. However, this interpretation may be
doubted in view of the fact that in the relevant energy
range the RR cross section is orders of magnitude smaller
than the DR cross section. Naively, one would expect
that a signiﬁcant interference between DR and RR re-
quires cross sections of similar magnitude.
It must be
kept in mind, however, that the asymmetry parameter

Q is also governed by the natural line width Γd. Inspec-
tion of Eq. 16 shows that a large value of Γd can make

up for a small RR transition matrix element
i
Fig. 6a shows the RR, DR and interference contributions
to the recombination cross section in the energy region of
the 3p53d2(3F) 2F resonance as calculated by perturba-
tion theory. With the width of the 3p53d2(3F) 2F reso-
nance due to its Super-Coster-Kronig decay channel be-
ing extraordinarily large (Γd = 1.06 eV obtained from
Cowan’s atomic-structure code [8]) the asymmetry in the
merged-beams rate coeﬃcient is retained even when the
RR cross section is artiﬁcially lowered by a factor of 10
(Fig. 6b). The theoretical asymmetry parameter changes
from Q = 3.97 to Q = 12.6. Our experimental ﬁndings
of Γd = 0.89 eV and of Q = 6.3 (see Tab. II) correspond
to these theoretical results.

Apart from interference between DR and RR another
source of distorted line shapes is the interaction be-
tween overlapping DR resonances of the same symmetry
[32]. From our R-Matrix calculation we ﬁnd two fur-
ther resonances of 2F symmetry, namely the resonances
3p53d(3F)4s 2F and 3p53d(1F)4s 2F located at 11.00 and
12.71 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7a, especially the
latter is overlapping with the broad 3p53d2(3F) 2F reso-
nance. In Figs. 7b and 7c we show how the line shape
of the 3p53d2(3F) 2F resonance depends on its (artiﬁ-
cially varied) distance to the 3p53d(1F)4s 2F resonance.
Clearly the shapes of both resonances are aﬀected by
their mutual separation. The experimental observation
of this eﬀect, however, is hindered by the presence of
the 2D resonances close to the 3p53d(1F)4s 2F resonance.
Under this circumstance the experimental resolution does
presently not suﬃce to reveal the theoretically predicted
subtle resonance-resonance interference.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In the experimental energy range 0-45 eV photore-
combination of Sc3+(3s23p6) ions is dominated by the
3p53d 1P nl and 3p54s 1P nl Rydberg series of DR res-
Signiﬁcant diﬀerences to the recombina-
onances.
tion of isoelectronic Ti4+ ions [26] are found that are
due to subtle diﬀerences in the electronic structure of
Sc3+ and Ti4+. Level energies, widths and resonance
strengths were determined for a number of doubly excited
Sc2+(3s23p53d2) and Sc2+(3s23p53d 4s) states. Further-
more, we ﬁnd a small experimental evidence for an asym-
metry of the 3p53d2(3F) 2F resonance line shape. A
more precise determination of the line shape from the
experimental data would require less statistical uncer-
tainties especially in the high energy tail of the reso-
nance. In the present measurement the high background
level from electron capture in Sc3+ collisions with resid-
ual gas molecules prevented this requirement from being
fulﬁlled. Moreover, the peaks on the low energy side of
the 3p53d2 2F resonance leave additional room for ambi-
guity.

Starting from rigorous continuum-bound transition
theory the Sc3+ photorecombination cross section has
been calculated using both the R-matrix method and a
perturbative treatment. We found that the line shape
of the 3p53d2(3F) 2F resonance is inﬂuenced by both in-
teracting resonances and interference between RR and
DR. In spite of the fact that the Sc3+ RR cross section is
almost negligibly small, DR-RR interference becomes no-
ticeable due to the large 3p53d2(3F) 2F resonance width
of 0.89 eV. Moreover, we have shown that relativistic
eﬀects play an important role in the recombination of
Sc3+. Three experimentally observed strong 3p53d2 2D
and 3p53d4s 2D resonances can only be reproduced the-
oretically by invoking relativistic eﬀects. Our R-matrix
calculations as well as the calculations of Gorczyca et al.
[6] that both have been restricted to LS-coupling fail in
reproducing these strong experimental peaks.

Our results show the limits of the independent-
processes and isolated-resonances approximations usu-
ally made in photorecombination calculations. A more
stringent test of our theoretical results could in principle
be provided by the measurement of high-resolution pho-
toionization cross sections of Sc2+(3p63d 2D) ions. Re-
sults of such an experiment will be reported elsewhere
[33].

function [34]. Its real and imaginary parts can eﬃciently
be calculated with a numerical algorithm by Humlicek
[35]. It should be noted that for Q
Eq. A2 yields the
Voigt proﬁle, i. e. the convolution of a Lorentzian (Eq. 14)
with a Gaussian.

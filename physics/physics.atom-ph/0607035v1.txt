Quantum calculations of a 1+1-dimensional model for double ionization in strong laser ﬁelds are
used to trace the time evolution from the ground state through ionization and rescattering to the
two electron escape. The subspace of symmetric escape, a prime characteristic of nonsequential
double ionization, remains accessible by a judicious choice of 1-d coordinates for the electrons.
The time resolved ionization ﬂuxes show the onset of single and double ionization, the sequence of
events during the pulse, and the inﬂuences of pulse duration, and reveal the relative importance of
sequential and non-sequential double ionization, even when ionization takes place during the same
ﬁeld cycle.

Double ionization in intense laser ﬁelds has been chal-
lenging because of a yield much higher than derived from
independent electron calculations, thus demonstrating
the signiﬁcance of electron interations (see [1] and ref-
erences therein). High resolution experiments revealed
that the two outgoing electrons preferably leave the atom
side by side, with the same parallel momenta [1, 2]. The
theoretical understanding and interpretation of this pro-
cess is still far from being complete. The most accu-
rate representations of the process, i.e.
the exact so-
lution of the time-dependent Schr¨ordinger equation for
two electrons in a laser ﬁeld [3] or S-matrix calculations
[4] are computationally demanding and still do not fully
represent the experiments. Low-dimensional models fre-
quently sacriﬁce the experimentally dominant subspace
of symmetric escape by restricting the electrons to move
along a common line (aligned-electron models) [5, 6], or
introduce other correlations, as in [7], where the motion
of the electron center of mass is restricted to be along
the ﬁeld polarization axis. The 1+1-dimensional model
we present here removes these drawbacks, and allows for
eﬃcient calculations which give time- and momentum-
resolved insights into the dynamics of the process, from
the turn on of the ﬁeld to the ﬁnal escape of the elec-
trons. The calculations reveal the time order of events
and clearly show the signiﬁcance of the saddle in the
symmetric subspace for the ionization yield, thus lending
further support to the ideas derived from studies of the
classical models [8].

The model is motivated by the rescattering scenario,
[9]. While most electrons leave the atom directly and
contribute to the single ionization channel, some have
their paths reversed by the ﬁeld and return to the core.
The acceleration by the ﬁeld brings in enough energy so
that when this energy is shared with another electron
close to the nucleus, each has enough energy to ionize.
During the collision with the other electron, a short lived
compound state is formed which then decays into diﬀer-
ent possible channels: double ionization, single ionization
or a repetition of the rescattering cycle. Starting from

this intermediate state a classical analysis easily yields
possible pathways to ionization [8]. The classical model
of non-sequential double ionization (NSDI) suggests that
the electrons may escape simultaneously if they pass suf-
ﬁciently close to a saddle in the symmetric subspace that
form in the presence of the electric ﬁeld. As the ﬁeld
phase changes, the saddles for this correlated electron
escape move along lines that keep a constant angle with
respect to the polarization axis.

The observation that the saddles move along lines
through the origin suggests a model where each electron
is conﬁned to move along this reaction coordinate [10].
The main diﬀerence of this model with the aligned elec-
tron models is that a symmetric motion of the electrons
is possible and not blocked by electron repulsion. The
present model is hence able to reproduce tunneling and
rescattering processes, single and sequential double ion-
izations and it correctly mimics the correlated electron
escape. Moreover, because of the restriction to 1+1 de-
grees of freedom it can be integrated by standard meth-
ods.

Taking into account that the lines form an angle of π/6
with the ﬁeld axis [8], the restricted classical Hamiltonian
for the two electrons in the linearly polarized laser ﬁeld
is given by (in atomic units) [10]:

where ri are the electron coordinates along the saddle

outside the barrier they are accelerated by the ﬁeld and
escape. Any asymmetry of electron motion around the
saddle can be ampliﬁed by the ﬁeld. Thus, even if they
escape simultaneously their ﬁnal momenta can be quite
diﬀerent (see Ref. [10] for examples of classical trajec-
tories in a static ﬁeld).
In this letter we analyze the
quantum dynamics of this model by solving the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation numerically by a Fourier
methods. The Coulomb singularities in the potential in
1/√x2 + e
(1) are smoothed by the substitution 1/x
with e = 0.6, which leads to a ground state energy of the
unperturbed atom of Eg =

−
For the analysis of the outgoing electrons, we follow
Ref. [3] and deﬁne regions in the conﬁguration space that
correspond to the neutral atom (A), the singly ionized
(Si) and the doubly ionized atom (Di) (see Fig. 1). These
deﬁnitions are suggested by practical considerations and
correspond eﬀectively to a truncation of the long range
eﬀects of the Coulomb potential at these distances. The
regions allow us to distinguish between the sequential and
the non-sequential (simultaneous) double ionization by
calculating the probability ﬂuxes between the appropri-
ate regions: i) The population of the singly ionized states
(SI) at a time t is obtained from the time integration of
the ﬂuxes from A to Si minus the ﬂuxes from Si to Dj;
ii) The population of NSDI states is obtained from the
time integration of the ﬂuxes from A to D1 and from A
to D3. iii) Integration of the ﬂuxes from Si to Dj gives a
measure of sequential double ionization (SDI) processes.
The ﬂuxes from A to D2 and from A to D4, correspond
to anti–correlated double ionization: they give negligible
contributions to the double ionization process and will
not be considered further here. Note that the deﬁnition
of the ﬂuxes allows us to distinguish two contributions to
the instantaneous double ionization yield: electrons may
pass directly from region A to D1, say, or they may ﬁrst
cross over to S1 and then to D1. The essential diﬀerence
is that in the ﬁrst case electron interactions are signif-

icant, whereas in the second case the electrons remain
suﬃciently far apart that their interactions are negligi-
ble. After a rescattering event both processes can hap-
pen. This suggests that the deﬁnition of NSDI should
be restricted to processes where electron interactions are
important, i.e. the direct ﬂux from A to D1 and D3. In
the following we will use the term only in this meaning.
As a ﬁrst result we show the ionization yields for the

responding to the ﬁeld parameters in Fig. 3. The times equal

lines in Fig. 3, starting with the one at t = 3.75 cycles (top

the ﬂuxes as described in the preceeding section. For
intermediate ﬁelds the NSDI and SDI signals are about
equal, but for higher ﬁelds SDI rises sharply, forming
the well known knee:
in hindsight, it is clear that only
the sequential double ionization can show the knee, as it
derives from the strong increase of independent electron
ionization at high ﬁelds. The NSDI-signal, on the other
hand, seems to saturate for ﬁeld amplitudes above about
0.25 a.u.

The time ordering of the process, resolved into the dif-
ferent ﬂuxes, is shown in Fig. 3 for a ﬁeld strength of
F = 0.16, below the knee. Up to the fourth extremum
the ﬁeld is not strong enough to ionize any electrons.
Shortly thereafter singly charged ions appear, but no
doubly charged ones.
Immediately after the ﬁfth ex-
tremum a strong single ionization is observed as well as a
ﬁrst double ionization signal. Note that the maximum of
double ionization occurs after the extremal ﬁeld strength,
at about the same time as the maximum in the single
ionization signal. This shows that in contrast to expec-
tations based on the simple man model [1, 9] for the re-
turning electron, the double ionization events occur when
the ﬁeld is still on.

The momentum distributions of the outgoing electrons
are obtained following the method proposed in [6] where
the wavefunction is propagated with all interactions in

tum space where time evolution (with neglected Coulomb
potentials and in the velocity gauge) becomes simply a
multiplication by a time dependent phase. Fourier trans-
forms of the parts of the wavefunction in the regions

successive extrema of the ﬁeld. The sequence starts with
the extremum at 3.75 cycles, as there is no noticable wave
function amplitude in the range
> 200 a.u. for
earlier extrema. The wave function that gives rise to the
NSDI near times of t = 2.25 oscillates with the ﬁeld and
extends into this space region only about 1.5 cycles later.
Thus, with the delay taken into account, the ﬁrst signals
in the NSDI sector in Fig. 4 correspond to the ﬁrst signals
in Fig. 3. The momentum distributions in the ﬁrst four
panels in Fig. 4 start out very much concentrated along
the diagonal p1 = p2. This conﬁrms that the bottleneck
for double ionization are the saddle conﬁgurations in the
symmetric subspace, described in [8].

After a few cycles, the diﬀerent ionization signals in
Fig. 3 and the momentum distributions in Fig. 4 experi-
ence signiﬁcant spreading and distortion. They then no
longer reﬂect the sequence of extrema and rescattering
events, and the temporal relation between the individual
processes gets blurred. Moreover, as time goes on, less
correlated and purely sequential processes become more
important. This suggests that the structure of the pro-
cess can best be resolved with short pulses, say up to 3
ﬁeld cycles. This is shorter than the pulses used so far[2],
but now within experimental reach [12].

The time ordering of the process and in particular the
presence of the ﬁeld when the electrons return to the nu-
cleus in the rescattering event, can also be understood
from the classical dynamics, as in [9], if the Coulomb
ﬁeld is taken into account. To this end we show in Fig. 5
the results from a classical trajectory calculation. As in
[9] we assume that an electron that tunnels out is re-
leased with zero momentum at the other side of the po-
tential barrier. It is then integrated classically until it
returns to the atom. Since the process involves motion
of a single electron along the ﬁeld axis, we can take a 1-d

averaged with a Gaussian of width 0.07 a.u.

perimental resolution (and to remove ﬁnite size ﬂuctuations
from our numerical grid). The ﬁeld phase is φ = 0 and the
amplitudes are F = 0.08 (a), F = 0.16 (b) and F = 0.4 (c).
In order to show the eﬀects of a varying phase and broader

over an undetermined phase φ and a wider Gaussian window
of 0.2 a.u. The data are the Fourier transforms of the parts

The electron that tunnels through the Stark barrier starts
with an energy
0.83 a.u., equal to the energy diﬀerence
between the ground state of a He atom and a He+ ion in
our model[9]. If the ﬁeld is weak, the electron starts far
from the core and can aquire considerable energy while
the ﬁeld brings it back. However, such processes are very
unlikely since the tunneling probability is negligible. The
relevant energy parameter when the electron returns to
the nucleus is the diﬀerence between energy of the two
electron system E(tr) and the potential energy of the sad-
Vs(tr). The data

collected in Fig. 5 (corresponding to F = 0.16) clearly
show that most electrons return while the ﬁeld is still on
in agreement with the sequence of events documented in
Fig. 3. For smaller F the range of positive excess energy
shrinks and moves towards larger values of t0 where the
tunneling probability is negligible. This indicates that
as F increases one cannot expect a sharp threshold be-
havior for the correlated simultaneous escape since the
contributions from the correlated events grow smoothly
with ﬁeld amplitude.

Fig. 6 shows results for an 8 cycle pulse and diﬀerent
ﬁeld strengths. The ﬁgure can be compared with Fig. 1 of
Ref. [6] obtained in the aligned electron model where due
to the overestimated Coulomb repulsion the area around
p1 = p2 is not populated. Here, this region is accessible
and provides information about the correlated electron
escape. With increasing F the double ionization signal
increases, but above the knee (F = 0.4) the strong con-
tributions in the second and fourth quadrant show the
strong inﬂuence of SDI. The distributions for undeter-
mined phase and wide averaging in Fig. 6d still show the
strong concentration of the momentum near the diago-
nal, but the interference structures in the corresponding
Fig. 6b are washed out. The investigation of these inter-
ference patterns is the subject of ongoing work.

The 1+1-dimensional model for double ionization of
atoms in strong laser ﬁelds discussed here gives access
to the time-dependence of events and the distribution
of ﬁnal momenta, including the subspace of symmetric
escape. The good reﬂection of experimental observations
suggests that the model can also be used to study other
aspects of the ionization process, such as the eﬀects of
diﬀerent pulse shapes or wave packet interferences.

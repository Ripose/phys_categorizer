We present experimental and theoretical results of a detailed study of laser-induced continuum
structures (LICS) in the photoionization continuum of helium out of the metastable state 2s 1S0.
The continuum dressing with a 1064 nm laser, couples the same region of the continuum to the
4s 1S0 state. The experimental data, presented for a range of intensities, show pronounced ion-
ization suppression (by as much as 70% with respect to the far-from-resonance value) as well as
enhancement, in a Beutler-Fano resonance proﬁle. This ionization suppression is a clear indica-
tion of population trapping mediated by coupling to a contiuum. We present experimental results
demonstrating the eﬀect of pulse delay upon the LICS, and for the behavior of LICS for both weak
and strong probe pulses. Simulations based upon numerical solution of the Schr¨odinger equation
model the experimental results. The atomic parameters (Rabi frequencies and Stark shifts) are
calculated using a simple model-potential method for the computation of the needed wavefunctions.
The simulations of the LICS proﬁles are in excellent agreement with experiment. We also present
an analytic formulation of pulsed LICS. We show that in the case of a probe pulse shorter than the
dressing one the LICS proﬁle is the convolution of the power spectra of the probe pulse with the
usual Fano proﬁle of stationary LICS. We discuss some consequences of deviation from steady-state
theory.

I. INTRODUCTION

A. Continuum coherence

The properties of the continuum of quantum states observed in the photoionization of an atom or the dissociation
of a molecule have attracted interest since the ﬁrst formulations of quantum theory. Until the widespread use of
lasers, the continuum was regarded as a dissipative system, to be treated by means of rate equations (typically using
the approximation of the Fermi Golden Rule [1] to calculate the transition rate into the continuum). Contemporary
views no longer regard continuum states as an irreversible drain of probability. An electron acted upon by a laser
ﬁeld of suﬃciently high frequency to produce ionization does not move irreversibly away from the binding region
[2–4]. Laser interactions with a continuum have been shown to exhibit Rabi-type oscillations (if the laser ﬁeld is
suﬃciently strong) [5,6] and to enable nearly complete population transfer into a continuum (i.e. photoionization or
photodissociation [7]) or from a continuum (i.e. photorecombination [8]). Both theoretical [7,9–12] and experimental
[6,13,14] work has shown that the wavefunction of an electron in a laser ﬁeld may often maintain coherence during
the course of photoionization, and that photodissociation can also maintain coherence. Consequences of continuum
coherence are to be found in the well-studied phenomena of autoionization [15–17], which is revealed as a resonance in
plots of photoionization cross-sections versus frequency. Such resonances display the eﬀect of interference between two
ionization channels whose destructive interference can lead to complete suppression of photoionization at a speciﬁc
wavelength.

One of the more interesting coherent phenomena involving the continuum is the use of a laser ﬁeld to embed an
autoionization resonance into an otherwise featureless photoionization continuum. This dressing of a continuum by a
bound state by means of a laser ﬁeld is termed a “laser induced continuum structure” (LICS) [18–25].

As with other types of resonances described by scattering theory, LICS can be observed in various reaction channels.
In the LICS observed in photoionization a strong laser ﬁeld, connecting an unpopulated bound state to the continuum,
mixes some bound-state character into the continuum; it places a resonance into the continuum. This optically induced
resonance can be detected by a second (possibly weaker) laser ﬁeld which serves as a probe and induces a transition
from a populated bound state into the newly structured continuum.

We remark that when the continuum is composed of several channels (derived e.g. from diﬀerent asymptotic internal
states of dissociation products) the dissociation has been shown to give rise to a quantum control scheme [26] in which
the ratio between the asymptotic channels can be controlled by tuning the dissociating (or dressing) laser across a
LICS resonance.

Theoretical descriptions of continuum structure near autoionizing resonances have been presented [27–31] as have
LICS in the absence of such resonances [32,33]. Observations of LICS in photoionization near autoionization resonances
[13,14,34,35] as well as observations of LICS in photoionization to an otherwise unstructured continuum [18–25] have
been reported recently. Under appropriate conditions this LICS can lead to the suppression of photoionization, by
creating a coherent-superposition of bound states immune to photoionization (a trapped state, or dark state [36]).
The occurrence of signiﬁcant photoionization suppression signals the creation of a dark state; only with coherent
excitation can this aspect of continuum coherence be revealed.

B. The resonance proﬁle

When a coherent radiation ﬁeld resonantly excites a two-state system, then a probing of either energy level by a
weak probe ﬁeld reveals a splitting (the Autler-Townes splitting) attributable to the dressing of bare atomic states
by a strong ﬁeld [37]. When the strong transition connects a bound (but unpopulated) state to a continuum, a weak
probe will again reveal structure, the LICS.

The theoretical basis for describing LICS has been presented in numerous articles (see for example [38,39]), for
cases in which the ﬁelds are constant-amplitude continuous-wave monochromatic, and for pulsed radiation. As such
work has shown, the LICS of photoionization typically takes the form of an asymmetric window resonance, for which
the frequency dependence of the photoionization cross-section σ(ω) may be parameterized by the form of a typical
scattering resonance in a background [17,40]

where x
ωR)/(Γ/2) is a dimensionless detuning of the light frequency ω away from the resonance value ωR,
measured in units of the resonance-width parameter (or loss rate) Γ. Equivalently, one may use a form akin to that

developed by Fano [15] and Fano and Cooper [16] to describe the Beutler-Fano proﬁles observed in autoionization or
electron-scattering cross-sections,

σ(ω) = σb(ω) + σa

(x + q)2
x2 + 1

where q is the dimensionless Fano q parameter. The terms C(ω) or σb(ω) are slowly varying (or constant) contributions
to the cross section. Appendix A describes simple estimators of the parameters when ﬁtting experimental data to
this functional form.

We found it useful to use a variant of these parameterizations,

where D is the detuning of the probe laser, and Γd and Γ0 are parameters discussed in section II C.

(cid:21)

Although we have presented proﬁle formulas appropriate to photoionization cross-sections, what is important for the
present paper is the functional dependence of an experimentally observed quantity, here σ(ω), upon a dimensionless
detuning variable x. It often proves convenient to ﬁt dimensionless observables with these parameterizations, in which
case the parameters A, B and C, or σa and σb, become dimensionless.

C. Present work

In an earlier paper [25] we presented experimental evidence for substantial suppression of photoionization by means
of LICS. As we stressed, only with the use of very coherent laser pulses, together with an appropriate choice of
atomic states, is it possible to observe pronounced suppression. Here we present further experimental results showing
dependence of the LICS proﬁle on various pulse properties.

Our experimental results are for LICS induced in metastable helium, by means of a dressing laser (1064 nm) that
couples the 4s 1S0 state into a continuum. The structure is observed by scanning the frequency of a probe laser which,
at a wavelength of 294 nm, couples the 2s 1S0 state into this same continuum. Figure 1 shows the relevant energy
levels and transitions.

We discuss numerical simulation of the experimental results, and show that with calculations of atomic parameters
the observations are in excellent agreement with computations. We present an analytic description of pulsed LICS,
emphasizing the diﬀerence between pulsed and steady excitation. These results reduce to expressions (1) and (2)
under appropriate conditions. Our calculations of needed atomic parameters (polarizabilities, Stark shifts, etc.) are
done using a simple eﬀective-potential model of the active electron (see Appendix B). We describe this method, and
we show that this model provides quantitative agreement with experiments.

Our observations of LICS in the photoionization of helium are carried out using an atomic beam of metastable
helium atoms, which cross spatially overlapping beams of pulsed laser radiation. We control the duration of the
pulses and the overlap in space and time. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus.

II. EXPERIMENTAL

A. The apparatus

a. The atomic beam. A pulsed beam of metastable helium atoms is formed as helium, at a stagnation pressure
of 1200 mbar, expands through a nozzle (General Valve, opening diameter 0.8 mm) and enters a region of pulsed
discharge located 4 mm from the nozzle. A skimmer (diameter 0.8 mm) placed 40 mm from the nozzle collimates the
atomic beam and separates the source chamber from the region of interaction and detection.

b. The metastable atoms. The metastable states of helium used for our photoionization experiments are populated
in a gas discharge, where the atoms are excited from the ground state 1s 1S0 by pulsed electron impact. To enhance
eﬃciency and stability of the discharge, a ﬁlament, placed 10 mm downstream, provides the discharge with a continuous
electron current of several mA. The peak current, produced by ions and electrons in the pulsed discharge, reaches 20
mA. The electron source enhances the eﬃciency of the metastable production by at least two orders of magnitude
and the breakdown voltage is reduced to 1/50 of the value needed for an unseeded discharge.

c. Diagnostics of metastable population We deduce the population of metastable atoms by using a two-photon
version of REMPI (resonant-enhanced multiphoton ionization) to produce photoions, with pulsed radiation from a
broadband dye laser (LPD 3000, Lambda Physik). The ions are observed as an electric current. Figure 3 shows the
REMPI transitions used to detect the 2s 1S0 and 2s 3S1 metastable atoms.

Figure 4 shows the ionization signal of the metastable singlet and triplet states as a function of probe-laser wave-
length. The REMPI transitions are strongly broadened by saturation. We also conﬁrmed that the ionization is
saturated. Populations are inferred from the heights of the ionization signal peaks. Typically 90% of the metastable
population is found in the triplet state 2s 3S1 , and 10% is found in the singlet state 2s 1S0 .

d. The lasers. The pulsed atomic beam crosses the coinciding axes of two pulsed laser beams: a UV probe pulse
and an IR dressing pulse. The probe laser ﬁeld, coupling the metastable state 2s 1S0 to the ionization continuum
(see Fig. 1), is derived from a single mode cw dye laser system operating at 587 nm. This radiation is ampliﬁed in a
pulsed dye ampliﬁer, pumped by the second harmonic of an injection-seeded Nd:YAG laser. The wavelength of the
10−6 in a Michelson-type wavemeter, using a He-Ne laser,
cw radiation is measured to an accuracy of ∆λ/λ = 2
stabilized on an iodine line, as a reference. The pulsed radiation is frequency-doubled in a BBO crystal, thereby
providing (probe) laser pulses with a pulse width ∆τ = 2.3 ns (half-width at 1/e of I(t)) at λ = 294 nm.

×

The pulse of the dressing laser couples the state 4s1S0 to the ionization continuum and induces the continuum
structure. This pulse, obtained from the fundamental frequency of the Nd:YAG laser (λ = 1064 nm), has a pulse
width ∆τ = 5.1 ns.

A folded optical delay line is used to adjust the time delay between the dressing and probe pulses. After passing
through the optical setup, pulse energies of up to 2 mJ for the probe laser and up to 250 mJ for the dressing laser are
delivered to the atomic beam. The laser diameters at the atomic beam position are 0.5 mm for the probe and 3.5 mm
for the dressing laser, yielding peak intensities of up to I (0)
d = 300 MW/cm2, respectively.
(we use a superscript I (0) to denote the peak value of a time-varying pulse I(t).) Because of the large diameter of the
dressing-laser beam, the variation of its intensity across the probe laser proﬁle is small.

p = 100 MW/cm2 and I (0)

e. Ionization detection.

Ionized helium atoms are mass-selectively detected with a double-thickness micro-sphere
plate (El Mul Technologies) after passing through a 30 cm time-of-ﬂight segment. The output current of the micro-
sphere plate is ampliﬁed with fast broadband ampliﬁers and integrated in a boxcar gated integrator (EG & G 4121
B).

The continuum structure induced by the dressing laser is revealed in the ionization of the metastable state 2s 1S0
produced by the probe laser. When the probe laser is tuned across the two-photon resonance between the states 2s
1S0 and 4s 1S0, we observe a strong and spectrally narrow feature in the ionization cross-section (see the following
subsections). The structure is due to the laser-induced mixing of the bound state 4s 1S0 with the ionization continuum.

B. Results

4

1. Background signal

At high laser intensities, two-photon ionization of the metastable triplet state (see Fig. 1) forms a background,
which has to be subtracted from the total ion signal. The background ionization was determined by tuning the UV
laser away from the region where LICS is observed and measuring the ionization probability with and without the IR
laser present. The diﬀerence of these two currents (the diﬀerence signal) is attributed to the two-photon (IR + UV)
ionization of the triplet level, the population of which exceeds that of the singlet level by about an order of magnitude.
Figure 5 shows the measured diﬀerence signal, relative to the total ion signal, as a function of probe intensity.
The probe laser frequency is here tuned also far away from the two photon resonance between states 2s 1S0 and
4s 1S0. The plotted signal is proportional to the ionization probability of the 2s 3S1 state. For comparison we show
the calculated ionization probability for 2s 3S1 state caused by one photon at 294 nm and one photon at 1064 nm,
using the theoretical ionization probability. Using wavefunctions described in Appendix B we obtained the result
10−9IpId. Here and elsewhere laser intensities are expressed in W/cm2 and the unit for the rate is
Γtriplet = 1.6
s−1. The calculated relative transition probability is in good agreement with the experimental data.

×

From Fig. 5 we see that the background signal contributes only a few percent to the total ion signal for I (0)

p < 10
MW/cm2, while it adds more than 30% for the highest probe laser intensity used here. This background signal has
been subtracted for all the data presented below.

2. LICS for weak probe laser

If the probe laser is weak, the shape of the continuum structure is dominated by the strong dressing laser, and the
probe does not aﬀect the internal structure of the atom. It is therefore possible to distinguish between the inﬂuence
of the dressing and probing lasers.

Figure 6 shows, for a weak probe laser, the observed structure in the ionization continuum of helium for various
dressing-laser intensities (in each column) and for two pulse timings (in each row). The left-hand column of frames
show the LICS produced by coincident laser pulses; the right-hand frames show LICS produced when the dressing
pulse precedes the probe pulse (negative delay) by 5 ns. The dotted lines are results from numerical simulations,
discussed in section III.

The continuum resonances exhibit typical asymmetric window-resonance structure as a function of frequency, such
as are observed in autoionization. The LICS exhibit an enhancement of photoionization, taking largest value Pmax
at frequency νmax, and a suppression of photoionization, a dip to Pmin centered at frequency νmin.

As can be seen, it is possible to control the photoionization probability by appropriately tuning the wavelength of
the probe laser, thereby selecting the region of enhancement or suppression of ionization. Photoionization suppression
indicates population trapping. We observe photoionization suppression as strong as a drop to 30% of the value far
from resonance [25].

The primary eﬀects of an increase in dressing-laser power are a broadening and a shift of the LICS proﬁle, both for
coincident and delayed laser pulses. This is expected: the dressing laser intensity is responsible for the width-parameter
Γ and the Stark shifts.

For delayed laser pulses the LICS is not as strong as, and is spectrally narrower than, for coincident pulses. This
is because when pulses are not coincident, the dressing laser is intensity is lower when the probe pulse samples the
continuum structure: the LICS width is smaller and less pronounced when the dressing is weaker.

3. LICS for strong probe laser

For a strong probe laser, it is no longer possible to distinguish between the eﬀect of the dressing and probing laser
pulses. Both pulses contribute to the continuum structure. Whether the inﬂuence of the probe pulse is negligible or not
can be estimated from the ionization probability of state 2s 1S0. Figure 7 shows the measured ionization probability of
state 2s 1S0 as a function of the probe laser intensity (in the absence of the dressing laser). The observed dependance
is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction (Fig. 7, dashed curve), based on the calculated ionization rate
Γ2s,p (see Table II).

For probe intensities of several tens of MW/cm2 the ionization is strongly saturated. In this regime the interaction
induced by the probe laser cannot be considered as a small perturbation of the atomic structure. The observed proﬁle
will consequently deviate from the proﬁles of eqns. (1) and (2).

5

p = 0.5 MW/cm2 (Fig. 8a) and I (0)

Figure 8 compares the observed LICS for weak and strong probe pulses. The peak values of probe laser intensities
are I (0)
p = 40 MW/cm2 (Fig. 8b). The peak intensity of the dressing laser was
I (0)
d = 44 MW/cm2 and 50 MW/cm2. An increase of the probe laser intensity reduces the peak value of the ionization,
relative to the value far from resonance, from 140% to 110%. This reduction of the photoionization enhancement is
the result of saturation: the atoms are rapidly photoionized for all frequencies except those where photoionization is
suppressed. Because the strong probe pulse ionizes about 90% of the population of the metastable singlet state (see
Fig. 7), the maximum enhancement of the ionization probability can be no more than 10%.

C. Fitting Experimental Data

To parameterize our experimental results we ﬁrst subtracted a linearly varying background ﬁtted to the far-from-
resonance values, and then performed a least-squares ﬁt of the resulting data to a version of the Breit-Wigner or
Fano-Cooper formula, Eqn. (3). This parameterization introduces two contributions to the overall width parameter
Γ = Γd + Γ0. The ionization rate of the dressing laser, Γd, can, in principle, be computed using the traditional Fermi
Golden Rule. The remaining term, Γ0, represents an additional empirical rate; it expresses the eﬀect of spontaneous
emission, of ﬂuctuations of intensity or phase, and other stochastic processes. Figure 9 shows an example of the
experimental data (small squares) and the best analytic ﬁt to this curve (dashed line). As can be seen, the data is
very well described by the analytic expression. Table I presents values of the least squares parameters for undelayed
pulses.

From several such ﬁts we found the trend of the width parameters as a function of dressing intensity. Figure 10

the photoionization rate Γd, calculated using the method described in section B. Theory and experiment are in very
good agreement.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATION

Usually laser induced continuum structures are deduced from the equations for the density matrix of an atom. This
approach allows one to take into account coherence dephasing processes such as laser frequency ﬂuctuations, collisions
etc. But in the case of coherent laser pulses, with transform-limited bandwidths, one can signiﬁcantly simplify the
description of the process by using the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for the amplitudes of atomic states
involved in the process.

We consider an atom interacting with two laser ﬁelds: a probe laser with amplitude

Ep(t), intensity Ip(t) and carrier
Ed(t), intensity Id(t) and carrier frequency ωd. The total electric

frequency ωp, and a dressing laser with amplitude
ﬁeld is

where ej is a unit vector. The probe and dressing lasers are tuned close to the two-photon Raman resonance between
states 1 and 2, and their carrier frequencies diﬀer from exact resonance by the two-photon detuning D, given by

We express the state vector

of the atom as a combination of two particular discrete states 1 and 2, with

energies E1 and E2, together with a sum over all other bound states and an integral over continuum states:

In principle, all of these quantities can be calculated if the atomic wavefunctions are known.
We note that the Fano parameter q is basically the ratio of polarizability (such as occurs in a Raman transition)

transitions dominate. The ionization probability is enhanced, when tuning the probe laser across the two-photon
resonance, because Raman-type transitions open additional (multiphoton) ionization channels from the initial state
to the ionization continuum. If q = 0 no Raman-type transitions are present and no enhancement of ionization can
be observed.

C. Values for Atomic Parameters

For the calculations we need the values of many transition matrix elements, both bound-bound and bound-
continuum. Due to the relative simplicity of the two-electron helium atom there exist several methods, of varying
complexity and accuracy, which can provide the needed wavefunctions [44–48]. However, these methods are usually
optimized for the calculation of particular parameters (such as the ionization energy).

Therefore, for our purposes it is desirable to use some simpler method. The simplest of these are based on the
assumption that each electron moves in an eﬀective central potential, and that therefore the atomic wavefunction is
separable into a product (antisymmetrized) of individual electron orbitals, each of which has a spherical harmonic for

8

angular dependence and a radial dependence given by the solution to an ordinary diﬀerential equation (see Appendix
B).

We have found that a simple single-electron model potential satisﬁes requirements for speed and accuracy. Appendix
B describes the mathematics of this method for computing matrix elements. As noted there, a single empirically
determined parameter λℓ ﬁxes the potential, and hence all the wavefunctions, for each orbital angular momentum ℓ.

Table II presents the theoretical values we used in the simulation.

Here Ip and Id are the intensity of probe and dressing lasers expressed in W/cm2. The ionization rates and Stark
shifts are expressed in s−1. These results are in good agreement with more elaborate computations carried out by
Klystra, Paspalakis and Knight [49]. The agreement with these more accurate results, and the successful ﬁtting of
our experimental data, support the validity of our atomic wavefunctions.

The numerical simulation of the observed LICS-proﬁle includes experimentally determined intensity ﬂuctuations
and integration over the spatial probe laser intensity proﬁle. These eﬀects have to be taken into account, because
position, bandwidth and shape of the LICS are strongly dependent on the laser power.

To account for pulse-to-pulse variations of the intensity we average our computed ionization probabilities over a
distribution of peak pulse intensities. We used a Monte-Carlo method to estimate the relevant integrals, assuming
intensities evenly distributed between 0.9 Ip and 1.1 Ip. The results of the simulations are in excellent agreement with
the experimental results, as are seen in Fig. 6.

D. Deviations from Steady State

When the probe pulse is weak, and much shorter than the strong dressing pulse, the excitation can be regarded,
to a ﬁrst approximation, as an example of steady-state LICS (see sections IV D - IV F). One expects, under these
circumstances, that an observed LICS proﬁle will follow the form of Eqns. (1) or (2) [39] or, equivalently (3), and
that the parameters qf it and Γf it obtained from ﬁtting such an expression will be equal to the values qtheo and Γtheo
obtained by evaluating matrix elements.

To show the eﬀects of pulse shapes we display, in Fig. 11 the proﬁles predicted in two approximations:

Steady-state proﬁle, using the theoretical q value.

•

•

Simulation for a single pair of pulses (i.e. transient theory), again using the theoretical q value.

The diﬀerence between these curves is small but it shows the importance of transient eﬀects and the limitation
of the steady-state approximation of sections IV D - IV F. Here “transient” means that we determine the ionization
probability from the solution of the diﬀerential equations (12) thereby taking into account the pulsed variability of the
probe interaction. The spectral width of this pulse, approximately 1/τp, eﬀectively contributes additional broadening,
and Γ0 = 0) is there complete suppression
Γ0, to the LICS proﬁle. Only with the steady-state approximation (τp → ∞
of photoionization.

In addition to the results just described, for which the probe pulse was timed to coincide with the peak value of the
dressing pulse, we have also obtained results with probe pulses delayed with respect to the peak of the dressing pulse.
As with the previously discussed results, it is possible to ﬁt these LICS proﬁles with the function shown in Eqn. (3).
Table III E gives the values of parameters from these ﬁts.

The width parameters obtained from ﬁts for delayed pulses are signiﬁcantly larger than what one would expect
from the value of the dressing intensity at the peak of the probe pulse. To emphasize this point, Fig. 12 shows the
dressing and probe envelopes. The point marked B indicates the dressing intensity required to produce the observed
width. The point marked A shows the (lower) intensity occurring at the peak of the probe pulse. As these points
show, it is not possible to evaluate the LICS proﬁle by considering only the moment of peak probe intensity. The
observed proﬁle averages in time the Stark shifts and the ionization rates.

F. Summary

In the simulations of the experimental data presented above, intensity ﬂuctuations of both lasers as well as an
integration over the spatial probe laser proﬁle are taken into account to describe the observed LICS. In the present
experiments the diameter of the dressing laser was much larger than that of the probe laser, and so the spatial
variation of the dressing laser intensity was neglected in the simulation.

a. Weak probe When the probe laser is weak, the continuum resonance is mainly determined by properties of the
dressing laser. Fluctuations in the dressing laser intensity can disturb the observation of the continuum resonance.
A change in the dressing laser intensity changes the Stark shifts as well as the peak value and central wavelength of
the LICS. Because the Stark shifts follow the ﬂuctuations of the dressing laser intensity, the position of the structure
varies with every laser pulse. The observed LICS is therefore broadened by the ﬂuctuations. In the most extreme
cases the detected ion signal, for a ﬁxed detuning, ﬂuctuates between the maximum ionization enhancement and
the ionization suppression. The averaging produced by the ﬂuctuation reduces the LICS contrast between maximum
enhancement and minimum suppression.

A weak probe laser does not aﬀect the LICS, and so the probe laser intensity ﬂuctuations have no inﬂuence on the
continuum resonance if there are no dramatic variations in the laser intensity for single pulses. It is not necessary, in
simulations, to average over intensity ﬂuctuations of a weak probe laser.

b. Strong probe When the probe laser is strong the continuum is modiﬁed by the dressing laser and by the
probe laser. The inﬂuence of the strong probe laser can be observed in the saturation of ionization, i.e. a reduced
enhancement in the continuum resonance. Although saturation might be reached in the center of the spatial probe
laser proﬁle, the intensity could still be below saturation in the wings. The maximum enhancement is stronger in the
wings than in the center of the proﬁle. An integration over the spatial proﬁle of a strong probe laser therefore leads
to less saturation than expected for constant strong laser intensity.

Fluctuations in the probe laser intensity determine, as do ﬂuctuations in the dressing laser intensity, additional

Stark shifts, i.e. variations in linewidth and position of the continuum resonance, as discussed above.

IV. ANALYTICAL EXPRESSIONS FOR THE LICS PROFILE

It is always instructive to augment numerical simulation with analyses that can provide explicit formulas for various
observables. We present in the following sections some examples of such formulas. We consider pulsed excitation, so
that one cannot always rely on the stationary solutions that are known to give the formulas Eqn. (1) and Eqn. (2)
for the LICS shape.

If we neglect the coupling Ω(t) of Eqn. (12), then the amplitude of C1(t) decays exponentially with time, while its

phase depends on the Stark shift S1(t). With this in mind we introduce the new variables

Equations (28) and (29) include explicitly the time dependence of the eﬀective two-photon detuning, and thus they
provide the desired analytic formulas for the LICS proﬁle. This expression will be simpliﬁed below for some interesting
limiting cases.

For small values of κ the ionization probability, and hence the observed LICS proﬁle, is proportional to κ,

In this approximation κ provides a theoretical estimate of the observed LICS proﬁle of P ; conversely, a parametric ﬁt

Eqn. (36), taken with Eqn. (28), provides an analytic expression for the shape of LICS in the pulsed ﬁelds. It is a

Equations (37) - (42) show how the transient nature of pulsed LICS aﬀects the proﬁle, raising the minimum value of

The previous analysis shows that the inﬂuence of the probe laser pulse duration τp (or the transit time of atoms

E. Stationary case, multiple continua

Let us consider the case α = 1, so that Ω2(t) = Γ1(t)Γ2(t) (only one continuum is involved in the process). Then

G. Comparison between theories

Our primary comparison between experiment and theory was made by means of numerical simulation – solving
the coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations, Eqn. (12). It is instructive to compare the results of those computations
with several analytic approximations discussed in the previous paragraphs. Figure 16 presents such a comparison.
The full-line curve shows the results obtained by integrating Eqn. (12). The dashed line is the ﬁnite-bandwidth
approximation of Eqn. (35). The dotted line is the quasistationary approximation of Eqn. (44). As can be seen, all
three curves are very close to each other. For these plots the value of Γdτp is 6.4. If this quantity were larger the
results would approach the dotted line (the quasistationary limit) even closer.

We have presented a detailed set of observations of LICS proﬁles obtained when coupling two states of metastable
helium to the same continuum by means of pulsed lasers. The proﬁles exhibit both enhanced and suppressed photoion-
ization, at appropriate wavelengths, for a narrow LICS in an otherwise ﬂat continuum. Photoionization suppression,
very pronounced for these observations, shows the presence of population trapping.

V. CONCLUSIONS

15

We have described a simple single-electron model potential whose wavefunctions provide remarkably good values
for atomic parameters. We have shown, in an appendix, that examples of oscillator strengths computed with this
potential are very close to values obtained using more elaborate methods of computing wavefunctions.

We have shown that solutions of the appropriate coupled diﬀerential equations, using atomic parameters (Stark

shifts and Rabi frequencies) computed with the model potential, provide excellent ﬁts to our experimental data.

We have developed analytic approximations to the photoionization probability produced by pulsed laser pairs, and
we have shown that these can provide a good approximation to the more elaborate and time-consuming solution of

APPENDIX A: ESTIMATING FANO PARAMETERS

To extract parameters from resonance proﬁles of either experimental data or simulations we carried out least-squares

ﬁts. Less elaborate estimates of the parameters can be obtained by inspection of the proﬁles.

Consider the proﬁle function proposed by Fano and Cooper to describe an autoionization resonance, with resonance
frequency ωR and width Γ, in the presence of nonresonant background. The photoionization cross section is expressible
in the Fano form

where q is the dimensionless Fano q parameter and x is a dimensionless detuning,

σ(ω) = σb(ω) + σa

(x + q)2
x2 + 1

,

x

(ω

≡

ωR)/(Γ/2).

Neglect of the slow variation of σb with frequency leads to a proﬁle which has a maximum, σmax, at ω = ωmax,
q. It follows that a measurement of
when x = xmax ≡
the extrema values of the cross section, σmax and σmin, and the associated frequencies ωmax and ωmin, together with
the asymptotic cross section σ(
) obtained far from resonance, can be used to determine the various parameters of
the proﬁle:

Note that if the resonance formula is applied to a case for which σb = 0 (i.e. there are no additional contributions
to background apart from the continuum in which the resonance is embedded), and if the LICS proﬁle is normalized
such that σa = 1, then σmin = 0 and σ(

APPENDIX B: THE MODEL POTENTIAL METHOD

1. The Radial Equation

When we introduce a separation of variables

ψ(r) = R(r)Y (θ, φ) = r−1P (r)Y (θ, φ),

into the Schr¨odinger equation for a particle of energy E, mass m and charge
we obtain the diﬀerential equation

(cid:18)
We take Y (θ, φ) to be an eigenfunction of L2, either a single spherical harmonic Yℓm(θ, φ) or any combination of
spherical harmonics with common value of ℓ, so that the diﬀerential operator L2 can be replaced by the eigenvalue
ℓ(ℓ + 1). It is useful, and customary, to introduce the Bohr radius a0 as the unit of length and to express energies in
multiples of the atomic unit of energy EAU

2. Eﬀective potentials

This equation has bounded solutions for any positive energy, E > 0, while for negative energies it has bounded
solutions for a set of discrete values, the bound states of the potential V (r) with angular momentum ℓ.

A popular approach to the determination of radial functions is the quantum-defect method originally developed
by Bates and Damgaard [50]. It was used for calculating the ionization rates for helium in [51–53]. This method
uses solutions to the radial equation for a Coulomb potential, but forces the bound energies to take speciﬁed values.
Unfortunately this requirement yields functions which diverge at small r, and this poses diﬃculties in the computation
of Stark shifts and two-photon Rabi frequencies when the laser frequency is large enough to cause ionization.

As was shown in [54] the use of a model potential for the calculation of the atomic parameters such as dynamical
polarizabilities, Stark shifts, multiphoton ionization rates is convenient. This method is based on the pseudopotential
theory [55–57]. Because an exact analytical expression for the pseudopotential cannot be derived a number of model
potential was considered.

When the eﬀective potential is a Coulomb potential for a charge Ze radial equation is the hydrogenic radial equation

As written here, the equation for a Coulomb potential involves three parameters: the nuclear charge Z, the angular
momentum ℓ, and the energy E. Rather than use the energy E, it proves useful to introduce alternative parameters.

let ν be deﬁned to produce the desired energies,

while retaining the integer values for ℓ. However, this approach, commonly termed the quantum defect method, does
not produce radial functions which remain bounded for all distances. In order that the hypergeometric function be a
polynomial, it is necessary that the ﬁrst argument be an integer, the radial quantum number nr,

APPENDIX C: NUMERICAL VALIDATION OF MODEL POTENTIAL

1. The Wavefunctions

Theoretical prediction of a LICS structure requires computation of the ionization rates Eqn. (15) , Stark shifts
Eqn. (16) and two-photon Rabi frequency Eqn. (18) using realistic wavefunctions. Because these various parameters
all require summations over many discrete states and integration over many continuum states, it is desirable to have
wavefunctions which require as little computational eﬀort as possible, while still providing accurate depiction of the
essential properties of the active electron. We have found that a simple single-electron model potential satisﬁes both
these requirements. Appendix B describes the mathematics of this method for computing matrix elements. As noted
there, a single empirically determined parameter λℓ ﬁxes the potential, and hence all the wavefunctions, for each
orbital angular momentum ℓ.

2. Calculations of the parameters of He

Because the singlet and triplet systems of He interacts only weakly, we consider each system to be independent.
For each system we calculate λℓ using the experimental term values from the NBS tables [74]. Some results of these
calculations are shown in table IV and in table V. As one can see from these tables, the value of λl depends weakly
on the energy. The radial transition moments are also slowly varying functions of energy. However, the Stark shifts
and two-photon Rabi frequency are very sensitive to the energy of intermediate states: when an accidental resonance
occurs then the use of an approximate energy value determined by νn can lead to large inaccuracy.

strength for S-P transitions in singlet and triplet He. There is exceptionally good agreement between our values and
those obtained with more sophisticated methods. Except for transitions from the ground state, the diﬀerences between
our values and the more accurate ones are always less than 10%. The lack of accuracy for transitions involving the
ground state is expected because here the inﬂuence of polarization and exchange eﬀects are greatest.

To test the accuracy of the continuum wavefunctions we have calculated the cross sections for photoionizations
from some excited levels. Comparisons of the cross sections calculated with the help of model potential with results of
other author are illustrated in Fig. 17, for the 2s 1S0 level. One can see that our values, obtained with a very simple
approach, are in very good agreement with previous ones obtained by more sophisticated methods. The accuracy of
our one-photon bound-bound and bound-free transitions validates the use of model-potential wavefunctions for the
calculation of Stark shifts and two-photon Rabi frequency for helium.

FIG. 1. Laser induced couplings in metastable helium. The probe laser at 294 nm and the dressing laser at 1064 nm couple
the metastable singlet state 2s 1S0 and the initially unpopulated excited state 4s 1S0 through the ionization continuum. For
strong laser intensities two-photon ionization (IR and UV) of the metastable triplet state 2s 3S1 forms an additional background
for the ion signal.

FIG. 2. Layout of experiment, showing atomic beam, discharge, skimmer and lasers. The helium atoms are excited in a
pulsed gas discharge. The atomic beam then interacts with the lasers in the center of a capacitor. The ions produced there are
accelerated and detected on a microsphere plate.

FIG. 3. REMPI transitions for detecting population in the metastable states of helium. The singlet state 2s1S0 is coupled
with pulsed radiation at 397 nm through the excited state 4p1P1 to the ionization continuum. The metastable triplet state
2s3S1 is ionized with laser light at 389 nm through the states 3p3P0,1,2.

FIG. 4. Ion signal resulting from the ionization of the metastable states after excitation of the helium atoms in a pulsed
gas discharge. The populations are probed by resonant enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) with a pulsed dye laser
(bandwidth 6 GHz). The probing transitions are strongly saturation-broadened. In the gas discharge about 90 % of the excited
helium atoms are found in the metastable triplet state 2s3S1, and only 10 % are in the singlet state 2s1S0.

FIG. 5. Diﬀerence between ion signals with and without IR laser. The probe laser frequency tuned far away from the
two-photon resonance where LICS is observed. The pump laser intensity is varied, while the dressing laser intensity is kept
constant at I (0)
S = 226 MW/cm2. The measured data are normalized to the total ionization signal from singlet- and triplet
state. Good agreement is found between the experimental values and the calculated results (dashed line).

FIG. 6. LICS for coincident (left side) and delayed (right side) laser pulses, when the dressing laser intensity is varied. The
experimental data are compared to results from numerical simulations (dotted lines), including laser intensity ﬂuctuations and
integration over the spatial proﬁle of the pump laser. Enhancement as well as strong suppression of ionization are observed.

FIG. 7. Observed and calculated ionization probability of state 2s1S0, as the pump laser intensity is increased. The dressing

laser is switched oﬀ.

FIG. 8. LICS proﬁle for weak and strong pump laser. The dressing laser intensity is I (0)

d = 44 MW/cm2 (Fig. 8 a). The
p = 50 MW/cm2 (Fig. 8 b). Both laser pulses are coincident. With increased pump laser intensity,

probe laser intensity is I (0)
the maximum enhancement as well as the suppression of ionization is reduced.

FIG. 9. An example of ﬁtting of the experimental data using Eqn. (3). Squares are experimental data, dotted line is
d = 75

the result of ﬁtting, circles are the diﬀerence between experimental data and the ﬁt (∆t = 0 ns, I (0)
MW/cm2).

p = 4 MW/cm2, I (0)

FIG. 10. Width parameters vs. intensity of the dressing pulse (see Eqn. (3) and Table I): (1) is the variation of the overall

width parameter Γ, (2) is the empirically determined Γd, (3) is the calculated photoionization rate Γd.

FIG. 11. LICS proﬁle for two approximations: the solid line shows the simulation results for a single pair of pulses, the

dotted line shows the proﬁle assuming steady-state conditions (q = 0.73, I (0)

p = 2.5 MW/cm2, I (0)

d = 38 MW/cm2).

FIG. 12. Dressing pulse and delayed probe pulse (∆t = −5 ns, I (0)

p = 4MW/cm2, I (0)

d = 75 MW/cm2).

FIG. 13. Plots of κ/κ0 versus D/Γd (detuning in units of the width) for q = 0.73 and various values of Γdτp. For given Γd

this product is proportional to the length of the probe laser pulse.

FIG. 14. Probe laser frequencies at which occurs the minimum (1) and the maximum (4) in the LICS proﬁle of ionization
P versus Γdτp. The eﬀect of the duration of the probe-laser pulse (with long dressing pulse) is clearly revealed. Steady-state
values (2 and 3) are shown by the dashed lines. They approach the former for large Γdτp.

FIG. 15. Values of maximum (1) and minimum (2) in the LICS proﬁle of ionization P versus Γdτp showing eﬀect of pulse

duration of probe pulse.

FIG. 16. LICS proﬁle in various approximations. The solid line shows the result obtained by numerically solving Eqn. (12).
The dashed line is the ﬁnite-bandwidth theory, Eqn (35). The dotted line is the quasistationary theory, Eqn (44). Here the
dressing laser intensity is I (0)
p = 2.5 MW/cm2, q = 0.73, τp = 2.3 ns, τd = 5.1
ns, the laser pulses are coincident.

d = 38 MW/cm2, the probe laser intensity is I (0)

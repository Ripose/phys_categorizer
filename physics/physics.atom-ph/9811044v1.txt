Abstract

If electrons had an electric dipole moment (EDM) they would induce EDMs

of atoms. The ratio of the atomic EDM to the electron EDM for a particular

atom is called the enhancement factor, R. We calculate the enhancement

factor for the francium and gold atoms, with the results 910 ± ∼ 5% for Fr

and 260 ± ∼ 15% for Au. The large values of these enhancement factors make

these atoms attractive for electron EDM measurements, and hence the search

for time-reversal invariance violation.

The existence of a non-zero electric dipole moment (EDM) of an atom, electron, or any

quantum-mechanical system would imply that time-reversal invariance (T ) and parity (P )

are violated. To date, no non-zero EDM has been observed, though experimental limits on

their magnitude have been obtained. The Standard Model predicts an upper limit on the
electron EDM of the order of 10−38e cm [1], while various alternative models predict values

many orders of magnitude larger (for reviews of predicted values of the electron EDM see

Refs. [2,3]). Measurements of the electron EDM are worthwhile as in the future they may

be able to distinguish between these models. Direct measurements of the electron EDM

are diﬃcult due to the electron’s charge (see, e.g., [4]), so results for the electron EDM are

obtained from atomic EDM measurements instead. The present limit on the electron EDM
is |de| < 4 × 10−27e cm, from an experiment on the EDM of the Tl atom [4]. A summary of

the results of atomic EDM measurements can be found in Table 6.2 of Ref. [5].

An atomic EDM can be induced by the presence of an electron EDM (as well as by other

mechanisms, such as T - and P -violating electron-nucleon or nucleon-nucleon interactions,

and nucleon EDMs). This allows us to obtain experimental results for the electron EDM

by measuring the atomic EDM. The atomic EDM (dA) induced by the electron EDM (de)

would be proportional to de, and the ratio R = dA/de for a particular atom is known as the

enhancement factor. As was ﬁrst noted by Sandars [6], the atomic EDM of a heavy atom
can be many times larger than the electron EDM; in fact, R is of the order of Z 3α2 times

a relativistic factor (∼ 3 in heavy atoms), where Z is the atomic number and α = 1/137

(see, e.g., [7,8,5]). To convert experimental results for atomic EDMs to results for electron

EDMs the value of the enhancement factor R is needed. Summaries of results for various

enhancement factors can be found in Ref. [4] and Table 6.1 of Ref. [5]. In this work we do

accurate calculations of R for the Fr and Au atoms.

The T - and P -odd interaction between the EDM of an electron and the electric ﬁeld of

the nucleus (−deγ0Σ · E) results in an admixture of the ground state of the electron with

excited states of opposite parity, according to perturbation theory. On one side of the atom

the ground state and excited state wave functions will have the same sign, while on the

other side they will have opposite signs. Therefore the total wave function will be larger on

one side of the atom, hence the electron will be more likely to be there and so the atom will

2

have an EDM. An expression for this atomic EDM, and hence R, can be presented in the

following form (see, e.g., Refs. [7,8,5]):

(for an atom with one valence electron), where |0i is the unperturbed ground state, {|ni} is

the set of states with which it is mixed (including unbound, continuum states for which the

sum should be replaced by an integral), −e is the charge on the electron, E is the electric ﬁeld
produced by the nucleus [= Zer/r3; the main contribution to the second matrix element in

(1) comes from short distances, where the electric ﬁeld of the nucleus is unscreened], z = rz,

and γ0 and Σ are the normal matrices of relativistic quantum mechanics. The ground state

of the valence electron in Fr is 7s, while in Au it is 6s. The operator (γ0 − 1)Σ · E is a

pseudoscalar and so it can only mix states having opposite parity and the same total angular

momentum. Therefore the ground state is only mixed with p1/2 states.

by using the following expression for the electron’s relativistic wave function (see, e.g., [9]):
ψnljm = (fnjl(r)Ωjlm, −ignjl(r)(σ · r/r)Ωjlm)T , where f and g are radial wave functions (fs

refers to the ground state and fnp the p1/2 excited states) and Ωjlm is a spherical spinor
(an eigenfunction of ˆj2 and ˆjz). Computer generated wave functions were used to calculate

the integrals in Eq. (2) (where available, previously determined values were used). These

wave functions were obtained using the relativistic Hartree-Fock method. The factors P (r)

and Q(r) take into account the screening of the nuclear electric ﬁeld by electrons and core

polarization corrections (for the non-direct core polarization contribution these factors ac-

tually become non-local operators). We also took into account correlation corrections to the

wave functions. The many-body perturbation theory methods that we used are described in

Refs. [10–14]. As a test, we also performed calculations using a semi-empirical method [7]

that does not require computer calculations. The results were in good agreement with the

numerical calculations.

For Fr, we used the experimental value of the 7s-7p1/2 radial integral of r [the ﬁrst integral

in (2)] that was determined in [15]: −5.238(10), in units of the Bohr radius (this compares

3

well with the calculated value in [14]: −5.241). For the 7s-8p1/2 radial integral of r we

used the value calculated in [14] (we used the most complete many-body calculation value

denoted by “Brueckner plus non-Brueckner” in Table IV of this work), with an estimated

accuracy of 3%. The 7s-9p1/2 and 7s-10p1/2 radial integrals of r were calculated by us, as

were the 7s-np1/2 values of the second integral in (2) (all with an estimated accuracy of

3%). We used the values of the 7s, 7p1/2, 8p1/2, and 9p1/2 energy levels listed in [16], while

we calculated the 10p1/2 energy level ourselves. We truncated the summation in (2) for the

discrete states at the 10p1/2 state, as the remainder of this series is very small (it gives a

contribution to the enhancement factor ∼ 3, i.e., 0.3%). For the unbound, continuum states

all integrals were calculated in the present work. For these we did not take into account

screening, core polarization or correlation corrections, and so the errors for these integrals

are larger (we estimate a 50% error for the whole continuum contribution), though this does

not have an excessively large eﬀect on the ﬁnal error as the contribution of the continuum

states to the enhancement factor is small (= 30). The ﬁnal value of the enhancement factor

for Fr is 910, with an estimated 5% error.

For Au, we used the energy levels listed in [17]. Using the experimental result for the

oscillator strength for the 6s-6p1/2 transition in [18], we obtained the value of the 6s-6p1/2

radial integral of r: −2.16(2). All of the other radial integrals were calculated in the present

work, with an estimated accuracy of 10% for the discrete states. Once again, we estimate

the error for the continuum contribution as 50% [the continuum contribution was again

small (= 20)]. We truncated the summation over discrete states at the 8p1/2 state, with the

remainder of the series giving a contribution ∼ 1 (0.3%) to the enhancement factor. The

ﬁnal value of the enhancement factor for Au is 260, with an estimated 15% error.

These results are in reasonable agreement with the previously determined estimates of

the enhancement factors: ≈ 1150 for Fr [19] and ≈ 250 for Au [20].

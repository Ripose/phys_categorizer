Abstract. We examine the eﬀect of the initial atomic momentum distribution on
the dynamics of the atom–optical realisation of the quantum kicked rotor. The
atoms are kicked by a pulsed optical lattice, the periodicity of which implies that
quasi–momentum is conserved in the transport problem. We study and compare
experimentally and theoretically two resonant limits of the kicked rotor: in the vicinity
of the quantum resonances and in the semiclassical limit of vanishing kicking period. It
is found that the same experimental distribution of quasi–momenta induces signiﬁcant
deviations from the kicked rotor model close to quantum resonance while its impact
close to the classical resonance (i.e. for small kicking period) vanishes.

Quantum transport . . . the role of quasi–momentum.

1. Introduction

The past decade has brought fascinating advances in the preparation and control of
single particles [1]. Atoms can now be cooled down to a level where the eﬀect of a single
photon recoil can be measured experimentally [2]. Single atom dynamics can thus be
controlled with high precision by introducing an external ﬁeld in the form of an optical
potential [3, 4].

A particular example of such a system, the atom–optics kicked rotor, has shed light
on interesting and paradigmatic quantum eﬀects including dynamical localisation [3] and
quantum resonance [5, 6, 7, 8]. In all such experiments, control of the initial conditions in
phase space is essential. In particular, the impact of diﬀerent momentum classes on the
dynamics near quantum resonance was explained recently [9, 10]. The atoms are kicked
by a spatially periodic potential which is pulsed on at a certain frequency. As dictated
by standard Bloch theory, the spatial periodicity implies that the quasi–momentum
for the centre-of-mass motion of each atom is conserved during the evolution. Quasi–
momentum is an intrinsically quantum variable which arises due to the translational
symmetry of the problem [11]. Since experiments with cold atoms typically use a broad,
continuous distribution of quasi–momenta, the experimental data represents a result
averaged over this initial distribution [9, 10, 12, 13].

The averaging over diﬀerent momentum classes leads to signiﬁcant deviations from
the standard δ–kicked rotor model [14] which typically does not consider the additional
control parameter introduced by the quasi–momentum. Such deviations have been
experimentally observed, in particular at quantum resonance [9] and have been explained
theoretically by means of a new pseudo–classical model introduced in [16] and applied
to the usual δ–kicked rotor in [10, 17].

In this paper, we use the same theoretical formalism to expose the innate similarities
and surprising diﬀerences between the limit in which the exact quantum resonant
driving is approached and the limit of vanishing kicking period. The former limit can
be described using the pseudo–classical model from [10, 17] (with an eﬀective Planck
constant deﬁned by the detuning from exact resonance), whilst the latter limit is the
usual classical limit of the kicked rotor (with the scaled kicking period as the eﬀective
Planck constant). Our theoretical analysis of the experimental data focuses on the role
of the quasi–momentum, which proves to be quite diﬀerent in the two “classical” limits
studied here.

2. The Atom–Optics Kicked Rotor

We consider a system of Caesium atoms in an optical standing wave (with wave number
kL) which is δ–pulsed with period τ . For suﬃciently large detuning from the atomic
absorption line, the Hamiltonian for an atom is given by [18]

H(t′) =

+ k cos(z)

δ(t′ − tτ ) ,

where p is the atomic momentum in units of 2~kL (i.e., in units of two-photon recoils),
z is the atomic position in units of 2kL, t′ is time and t is the kick number. The scaled
kicking period τ is deﬁned by the equation τ = 8ERT /~, where ER = ~2k2
L/2M is the
recoil energy (associated with the energy change of a Caesium atom of mass M after
emission of a photon of wavelength λL = 2π/kL = 852 nm). The kicking strength of the
system is given by k which is a dimensionless parameter proportional to the intensity
of the kicking ﬁeld [3, 18].

Experimentally, momentum kicks are delivered to the atoms by an optical lattice
which is created by a 150mW diode laser injection locked to a lower power feedback
stabilised source at 852 nm. Kicking laser powers of up to 30 mW were employed for
detunings of 500 MHz from the 6S1/2(F = 4) → 6P3/2(F ′ = 5) transition of Caesium.
For the experimental results presented in this paper, the average energy of the atomic
ensemble was measured after up to 20 kicks. To control the pulse timing, a custom
built programmable pulse generator was employed to gate an acousto–optic modulator
which controlled the amount of kicking light reaching the atomic sample. Timing of
the experiment was controlled by a real-time, soft-ware based computer system with a
latency on the order of 10µs.

For the classical resonance experiments reported here, the kicking pulse width was
240 ns, whilst for the quantum resonance results, a 480 ns pulse width was used. In the
classical limit of vanishing kicking period, the δ–kick approximation is violated in the
experiment (although for the small kick numbers and kicking strengths used here, our
results do not show deviations from the δ–kick theory [19, 20, 21]). As a consequence,
it is possible to probe the dynamics at exact quantum resonance, but not at the exact
classical limit, since the pulse period τ should always exceed the pulse width to ensure
a reliable approximation to δ–pulses.

The experimental sequence ran as follows: Atoms were released from the magneto–
optical trap [2] and then kicked by a series of light pulses. A free expansion time of 12
ms was then allowed followed by “freezing” of the atomic motion in optical molasses and
subsequent CCD imaging of the resultant atomic cloud [8]. Mean energies are extracted
from the raw data by calculating the second moment of the experimentally measured
momentum distribution of the atoms’ centre-of-mass motion.

By exploiting the spatial periodicity of the Hamiltonian (1), the atomic dynamics
along the z axis can be reduced to that of a rotor on a circle by Bloch’s Theorem [10].
This introduces the additional parameter β ∈ [0, 1) which represents the atomic quasi–
momentum – a constant of the motion by Bloch’s theorem. The fractional part of the
physical momentum p in the units given above corresponds to the quasi–momentum
which is practically uniformly distributed in the fundamental Brillouin zone deﬁned by
the periodic kick potential [10]. The one-kick propagation operator for a given atom is

3. Unifying Classical Description of Quantum and Classical Resonance

The quantum dynamics in the two semiclassical limits studied here is approximated by
the following map [12, 17]:

It+1 = It + ˜k sin(θt+1) ,
θt+1 = θt ± It + τ β mod(2π),

(3)
where τ = 2πℓ + ǫ and ˜k = k|ǫ|, and ℓ = 0, 1, 2 (± is the sign of ǫ, and for ℓ = 0 only +
is allowed). The above map is similar to the well-studied Standard Map [22] augmented
by the term τ β which accounts for the experimental quasi–momentum distribution.
Changing variables to J = ±I + ℓπ + τ β, ϑ = θ + π(1 − sign(ǫ))/2 formally gives the
true Standard Map

Jt+1 = Jt + ˜k sin(ϑt+1) ,
ϑt+1 = ϑt + Jt .

The mean energy is calculated using the formula

(cid:10)δJ 2
Although the map (4) is not explicitly dependent on the additional β dependent term,
we note that the initial conditions in momentum space are given by J0 = ±I0 + πℓ + τ β,
i.e., they are deﬁned by the initial choice of quasi–momentum β.

δJt = Jt − J0.

Two a priori quite diﬀerent regimes are described by either of the two maps (3) or
(4): ﬁrstly that for ℓ = 0, and τ → 0 and secondly that for ℓ > 0, τ → 2πℓ, for integer
ℓ. In the case where ℓ = 0 we have ǫ = τ and J = τ p, with the physical momentum p
in units of two–photon recoils [12]. For integer ℓ > 0, the map in (4) approximates the
dynamics near the fundamental quantum resonances occurring at τ = 2πℓ. As shown
in Refs. [10, 17], the one-kick propagator (2) may be rewritten in the form

ˆUβ(t) = e−i˜k cos(ˆθ)/|ǫ| e−i ˆHβ/|ǫ| ,

(6)
where ǫ = τ − 2πℓ, ˜k = |ǫ| k, ˆI = |ǫ| ˆN and ˆHβ = 1
2sign(ǫ)ˆI2 +ˆI(πℓ + τ β). Considering |ǫ|
to be an eﬀective Planck constant, we see that the map given in Eq. (3) approximates
the dynamics induced by (2) in both classical limits for ǫ → 0.

Figure 1 demonstrates the essential diﬀerence between the two semiclassical limits
In the case where ℓ = 0 (see Fig. 1 (a)), a uniform quasi–momentum

distribution on [0, 1) leads to the initial momenta J0 being uniformly distributed on the
interval [0, σpǫ), where σp is the characteristic width of the initial atomic momentum
distribution in units of two-photon recoils. Therefore, for σp ∼ 1, the initial momenta lie
entirely within the region of phase space dominated by the nonlinear resonance island of
the Standard Map . For ℓ = 1 (see Fig. 1 (b)), and the same uniform quasi–momentum
distribution, the initial momenta populate the full unit cell [π, 3π) in the periodic phase
space which encompasses not only the nonlinear resonance island at J = 2π, but also
regular “rotation” motion beyond it. Therefore the same experimental quasi–momentum
distribution leads to diﬀerent behaviour of the atomic ensemble in the two limits of ℓ = 0
and ℓ 6= 0.

Based on the maps (3) and (4), useful results were previously derived for the analysis
of experimental data [12, 17]. These results may be summarised by the following single
parameter scaling functions which diﬀer for the two limits of interest here. For ℓ = 0,
the scaling function of the mean energy close to ǫ = τ = 0 is given by

with x = tpk |ǫ| and the function Gcl as derived in [12, 23].

In the following section, we compare experimental data for the two diﬀerent cases

number for k ≈ 5, taken for small values of the detuning ǫ in the limits τ → 0
(a) and ǫ → 0 for ℓ = 1, 2 (b).
In particular, we have (a) ǫ = 0.033 (circles) and
ǫ ≈ 0.08 (squares), and (b) |ǫ| . 0.005 (circles) and ǫ ≈ 0.08 (squares), along with
classical simulations using the map (4) (dashed lines). We note the oscillatory nature
of the energy curve for ﬁnite detuning ǫ, which may be viewed as a consequence of the
dynamics represented by the phase spaces in Fig. 1. The inset in (a) shows a detailed
experimental scan of the classical resonance peak as τ = ǫ → 0, for k ≈ 2.5 and after
t = 5 kicks.

4. Experimental vs. Theoretical Results

In Figure 2, experimentally measured energies close to the classical and quantum
resonances are plotted against the kick number. In both plots of this ﬁgure, the observed
oscillatory behaviour may be understood in terms of the pendulum approximation to the
dynamics of the map (4) as embodied by the functions Gcl(x) or Gq(x). [10, 12, 17, 23].
For small times (t < 5 for the data in Fig. 2 (a)), the energy growth near the classical
resonance is ballistic, i.e., the energy grows quadratically in time.

We note that ballistic motion is also predicted to occur at quantum resonance for
an atomic ensemble with a very narrow initial momentum distribution [24, 25]. But the
broad initial momentum distribution present in cold atom experiments as discussed here,
typically leads to a uniform distribution of all possible values of quasi–momentum [9, 10].
In terms of the classical model reviewed in the previous section, these experimental initial
conditions correspond to initial momenta distributed over the full phase space cell, as
shown in Fig. 1 (b). The majority of the atoms obey rotational motion with almost

constant energies (see Fig. 1 (b)), whilst only a small sub-class follows the motion inside
the nonlinear resonance island, which for a ﬁnite time (depending on the detuning ǫ)
supports ballistic energy growth [10, 17].

The connection between the dynamics in the classical limit and that for a quantum
particle starting from a momentum eigenstate is found in the term τ β in the map (3).
We see that this term may become zero in either of the following limits: τ → 0 or β → 0.
In both cases, the eﬀect is to regain ballistic energy growth. The inset in Fig. 2 (a)
shows a detailed scan of the mean energy near the classical resonance as τ → 0 which
emphasises the rapid energy growth seen in this regime associated with the ballistic
classical resonance.

Figure 2 (b) shows mean energy measurements at exact quantum resonance (circles)
and for ǫ ≈ 0.08 along with ǫ–classical simulation results (dashed lines). For the same
experimental momentum distribution, only linear mean energy growth is predicted to
occur at exact quantum resonance. Additionally, the data shown here demonstrate a
practical problem which arises from the uniform distribution of quasi–momenta over
the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. Because only the quasi–momentum classes β ≈ 1/2 (for ℓ = 1)
and β ≈ 0, 1/2 (for ℓ = 2) experience quantum resonant dynamics [9, 10, 15], only a
small number of resonant atoms are responsible for the linear growth of the ensemble
mean energy. The measurement of the mean energy at exact quantum resonance is
therefore experimentally very challenging since the signal-to-noise ratio is low for the
small population of resonant atoms [5, 7, 9, 10]. This leads to an apparent saturation
of energy growth in the quantum resonance case as seen in Fig. 2 (b), which arises, in
fact, from the diﬃculty in measuring the resonant atomic population.

By comparison with the data in 2 (a) for the classical resonance, we see that,
even though the mean energies involved are much larger than those for the quantum
resonance, the initial quadratic mean energy growth can easily be resolved since
practically the entire atomic ensemble experiences resonant energy growth in this regime.
This is precisely because as τ tends to zero, the β dependence of the map (3) is removed
as the term τ β vanishes at the same rate as τ .

Lastly, Fig. 3 shows rescaled data from experimental measurements for various
experimental parameters with ℓ = 0 (circles) and ℓ = 1, 2 (squares). The data taken
in the classical case (ℓ = 0) falls on or close to the classical scaling function (solid line
in Fig. 3) and that, likewise, the data taken for ℓ = 1, 2 falls on or near the quantum
scaling curve (dash–dotted line). The narrower nature of the classical resonance peak
is emphasised by this plot. The dense set of points (circles) shown for x . 3 in the
classical case come from the data shown in the inset of in Fig. 2 (a). This data provides
a detailed conﬁrmation of the classical scaling function’s validity for smaller values of
x than previously observed experimentally [23]. For larger x, the data points show
more scatter because of systematic ﬂuctuations in the initial momentum spread and the
diﬃculty in observing the peak very close to resonance for a larger number of kicks [23].

the quantum resonances at τ = 2π and 4π (squares). In particular, the circles for x . 3
are rescaled data from the inset of Fig. 2 (a). The mean energies have been scaled by
the theoretical peak height of the resonances, i.e., by k2t2/4 for the classical resonance
[12] and k2t/4 for the quantum resonance data [10, 17]. The scaling functions for
the classical (7) and quantum resonances (8) are shown as a solid line and a dashed
line respectively. The narrower width of the classical resonance peak is immediately
apparent. This ﬁgure also shows the utility of the scaling function in the comparison
of data which is meaningful in the scaled units even for a wide range of the three
parameters: here for k = 2.5 and k = 5 (ℓ = 0) and k = 5 (ℓ = 1, 2), 0.033 ≤ ǫ ≤ 0.1
(ℓ = 0) and 0.03 ≤ ǫ < 0.3 (ℓ = 1, 2), and 3 ≤ t ≤ 16. Error bars represent statistical
ﬂuctuations over three independent experiments.

5. Conclusion

We have demonstrated the eﬀect of averaging over a uniform quasi–momentum
distribution in two diﬀerent semiclassical limits of the atom–optics kicked rotor. For
the same experimental quasi–momentum distribution, the true classical limit gives rise
to ballistic energy growth whereas in the pseudo-classical limit approximating quantum
resonance only linear growth occurs.

This diﬀerence is explained by considering the inclusion of the quasi–momentum
dependent term τ β in the theoretical description. If this term approaches zero, which
limit τ → 0 or starting
may be accomplished either by performing the classical
with a very narrow momentum distribution such as that provided by a Bose-Einstein
condensate [25], ballistic energy growth is recovered. However, for standard atom–optics

kicked rotor experiments using cold atoms only linear energy growth is predicted at
quantum resonance since the quasi–momentum β is uniformly distributed in the entire
Brillouin zone.

The classical theory of Section 3 of the near resonant dynamics thus uniﬁes the
description of quantum and classical resonance behaviour of the atom–optics kicked
rotor, and is elegantly summarised by two classical one-parameter scaling laws for the
classical and quantum resonance peaks. These laws are very useful for a detailed analysis
of experimental results in regimes in which measurements are limited by the signal-to-
noise ratio.

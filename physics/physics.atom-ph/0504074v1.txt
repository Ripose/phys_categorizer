We report a theoretical study of a chaotic KAM system, in a regime where the eigenstates have
generic localization properties resulting from transport though classical cantori. We ﬁnd eigenvalue
statistics of a form analogous to the critical statistics of a Metal-Insulator Transition in a disordered
system: the variances have a linear form Σ2(L) ≃ 1
2 (1 − D2)L, where D2 is a fractal dimension
which characterizes the wavefunctions. The nearest-neighbour statistics assume an invariant form
which, despite a fully chaotic classical phase-space, is far from GOE.

Random Matrix Theory (RMT) is used to describe
the quantum spectral ﬂuctuations of classically chaotic
systems as well as disordered metals in the delocalized
regime. For the well-studied orthogonal symmetry class,
the level spacings distributions are appproximated by
the well-known GOE (Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble)
4 s2. For integrable systems, as
form P (s)
well as disordered conductors after Anderson localization,
one ﬁnds instead uncorrelated Poisson statistics, with
P (s)
s. But there is much current interest in
so-called ‘critical’ statistics [1, 2], intermediate between
those of RMT and the Poisson. These were extensively
investigated in relation to the Metal Insulator Transition
(MIT) occurring in 3-dimensional metals. A new univer-
sal distribution termed ‘semi-Poisson’, P (s)
2s
with a long-range Poisson tail but the short range re-
pulsion of the RMT form [3] has been associated with
the MIT [4]. For critical statistics a very interesting
connection has been established between the multifrac-
tal characteristics of the wavefunctions and those of the
spectral ﬂuctuations [1, 5]: the number variances of the
spectra are linear Σ2(L)
χL for L >> 1. The slope,
D2/d) < 1, was shown to be related to a
χ
fractal dimension D2 obtained from the second moment
of the wavefunction and to d, the spatial dimension of the
system. For integrable dynamics, in contrast, Σ2(L) = L
while for a GOE, Σ2(L)

Ln(L).

There are systems without disorder such as the
Coulomb billiard [3] where the dynamics would be in-
tegrable were it not for a discontinuity or small scat-
tering centre which instantly breaks all classical phase-
space barriers. Such pseudo-integrable systems have also
been found to have semi-Poisson level spacings [3]. Crit-
ical statistics are predicted to be a generic feature [2] of
these and other types of non-KAM systems. Multifrac-
tal behaviour has been demonstrated for Cantor spectra
[6] where the level density itself is not smooth. How-
ever, until now, critical statistics have not been seen -
and were not thought to be relevant to- KAM systems.

∗email:t.monteiro@ucl.ac.uk

These are systems -ubiquitous in many areas of physics-
where the transition to chaos, as a perturbing parameter
is increased, is quite gradual.

Atoms in optical lattices subjected to pairs of pulses
of ﬁnite duration were recently shown to provide a good
experimental example of transport through a cantorus
[7]; however, that system is integrable except around
p
0. Further experiments using instead pairs of near-δ
‘kicks’, showed that the 2δ-kicked rotor (2δ-KR) has a
more uniform classical phase space, with fully chaotic re-
gions sandwiched between ‘trapping regions’, where the
classical trajectories stick [8]; this more uniform phase-
space permitted a generic, fully analytical treatment of
the anomalous classical diﬀusion, without any detailed
study of the classical phase-space.

We show here that the 2δ-KR enables us to ﬁnally iso-
late the signatures of fractal partial classical barriers in
the eigenvalue statistics of a KAM system. We identify
critical statistics at a localization-delocalization border,
which can be compared with the MIT. This critical re-
gion has linear variances, with a slope related to the frac-
tal scaling of the wavefunctions. Surprisingly, the level-
spacings, P (s), take an intermediate form, invariant over
the critical regime, which is neither semi-Poissonian nor
approaches the GOE form.

Cantori are the fractal remnants of broken tori, which
result at the end of a sequence of torus-breaking stipu-
lated by the well-known KAM theorem [9]. The most
robust cantori were found to result from the break-up
of tori with winding numbers given by the golden-ratio
R = (√5
1)/2. The corresponding classical and quan-
tum transport has been extensively studied in the Quan-
tum Kicked Rotor (QKR) and other standard KAM sys-
tems [10, 11, 12]. But these studies concern the proper-
ties of the phase-space local to the golden ratio cantorus.
The cantori are embedded in a phase-space still substan-
tially covered with stable islands. Hence signatures of the
classical fractal structure in the spectral ﬂuctuations are
masked by localization of quantum states on diﬀerent sta-
ble structures with diﬀerent scaling characteristics. Be-
low, we use the term critical statistics to make a clear
distinction between the intermediate statistics analogous
to those found in disordered and chaotic systems and the
intermediate mixed-phase space statistics observed widely
in systems for which a signiﬁcant fraction classical phase-
space is covered by stable islands. The latter are also of
much current interest eg [13]. However, in the ‘critical’
regime we study here, stable islands occupy
0.1% of
total classical phase-space area so their inﬂuence is neg-
ligible.

The extensively studied Hamiltonian of the QKR,
H(x, p) = p2
involves a se-
quence of time-periodic ‘kicks’ (with period T ) applied
to a particle. The implementation using cold atoms in
optical lattices [14] has provided a convincing demon-
stration of the quantum chaos phenomenon of Dynam-
ical Localization see [15] and references therein. The
2δ-KR involves the minor modiﬁcation of applying pairs
of pulses. The modiﬁed kick potential
is V (x, t) =

A study of the spectral ﬂuctuations of a time-periodic

than of RMT : ie if the dimensionality of the U (T, 0)

in the summation represents the total eﬀect of the kick-
pair and the small time interval ǫ. As ǫ is small, the

The corresponding classical diﬀusion was studied in [8]:
(2n+1)π/ǫ
the consecutive kicks cancel for momenta p
generating momentum-trapping regions permeated by
broken phase-space barriers. The diﬀusion correlations
which control transport through these regions, indeed
depend only on Kǫ. Classical phase-space is periodic
in p and partly partitioned into equal ‘cells’ of width
∆p = 2π/ǫ. The corresponding band-structure of U is il-
lustrated in Fig.1(b): the band oscillates as shown, and U
is approximately partitioned into sub-matrices of dimen-
sion N = 2π
ǫ~ corresponding to the momentum cells. At
the centre of the cells, classical diﬀusion rates are of the
K 2/~,
same order as the KR, so localization lengths Lp
for eigenstates well away from the trapping regions.

∼

The key to our work is our ability to vary the coupling
between the cells (eg by opening/closing the classical
fractal ‘gates’ between them) separately from b/N , the
degree of ﬁlling of each individual cell. We begin by deﬁn-
ing a localized limit, where b << N and Lp << N ~ = 2π
ǫ .
It is clear that most states feel no conﬁnement and this
limit is Poissonian.

If we increase K 2/~ but have negligible coupling be-
tween cells, we approach the limit b/N
1. Then for
N ~ as the probability for all states
all eigenstates, Lp
gradually ﬁlls the cell uniformly. At the other extreme,
if we allow strong coupling between cells, we move to
yet another limit, as an increasing proportion of eigen-
states become delocalized over several cells. The oscilla-
tory structure of the band is lost and this limit regains
the characteristics of the QKR. For Ntot >> b
N this
delocalized limit is also Poissonian [18].

2δ-QKR for K = 20, ǫ = 0.0175 and ~ = 1/8 and 1/30

ets shows a long-range tail of ‘staircase’ form which on aver-
age follows the exponential N (p) ∼ exp −2(p − p)/Lp where
Lp = N ~/2d; since N ~ = 2π/ǫ, the ~-dependence of Lp is de-
termined by the drop in probability, d, at each successive set
of cantori. The ﬁst 1 − 3 steps of the staircase can be seen in
experiments with optical lattices [7, 8]. Figure (b) shows that
Ln(2d) plotted against Ln(~ǫ) lies on straight lines of invari-
ant Kǫ = Kǫ, with constant slope 0.75. Hence d ∝ (~ǫ)0.75
and Lp ∝ ~−0.75 -in contrast to the well-known QKR result
Lp ∝ ~−1. The localization border (K 2
ǫ /~ǫ ≃ 2π, is shown by

(2n + 1)π/ǫ
sets in, and states become spread over several cells, this
procedure can fail to assign states meaningfully, but in
this case the statistics revert back to the Poisson limit.
The cells each contained (depending on ~ǫ) 500

over 20

a linear form, Σ2(L)

FIG. 3: Fig. (a) shows the variances Σ2(L) statistics and the
form Σ2(L) = 0.125L in the critical regime, corresponding to
a slope χ = 1/2(1−D2) where D2 = 0.75 is the fractal dimen-
sion obtained from the wavefunctions. The insets plot χ along
the dotted line cuts in Fig.2. The arrows indicate the localiza-
tion and delocalization borders respectively: critical statistics
are seen in between. In the right insets, n = ~−1. Fig. (b)
shows the corresponding NNS distribution seen everywhere in
the critical regime. Two histograms each using about 50, 000
eigenvalues are plotted (with K = 7, ~ǫ = 1/200, 40 cells of
about 1250 states and K = 9, ~ǫ = 1/400, 20 cells of 2500
states) showing that the results are insensitive to the cell
size. The ﬁt to a Berry-Robnik distribution is also shown,
for q = 0.66. The insets show that a value of q = 0.66 is
obtained between the localization and delocalization arrows.

In Fig.3(b), corresponding nearest spacings distribu-
tion (NNS) are shown. Histograms obtained for two dif-
ferent cell sizes, are indistinguishable, indicating that the
degree of ‘binning’ does not aﬀect the results. They rep-
resent a distribution which, surprisingly, is clearly neither
close to GOE nor semi-Poisson. A best ﬁt to the well-
known Berry-Robnik (BR) distribution [17] is also shown
with a parameter q = 0.66. In a mixed phase-space sys-
tem, in the semiclassical limit, q indicates the fraction
of phase-space which is chaotic. Yet here 99.9% of the
classical phase-space area is chaotic: the fractal trapping
regions mimic the eﬀects of stable islands covering 1/3rd
of phase-space. While the BR distribution gives excel-
lent results, the ﬁt to a Brody distribution gives rather
poor results, due to the absence of short-range repulsion.
However, the q = 0.66 ﬁt -in a fully chaotic dynamical
regime- motivates further theoretical development.

In sum, in the critical regime, just before delocaliza-
tion, classical trajectories are trapped within a momen-
tum cell for extremely long times, but are all able to ex-
plore the fractal trapping regions which border the cell.
The corresponding typical quantum eigenstates are also
extended over -but essentially conﬁned within- one cell.
Without the tori/stable islands of a mixed phase-space
system to exclude them from parts of phase space, they
can sample the fractal regions (more or less) democrat-
ically. Hence the fractal ‘ﬁngerprint’ becomes a global
property of the full quantum spectrum, rather than of a
local subset of states. This enables us to demonstrate,
for the ﬁrst time, that critical statistics - in particular
the relation between fractal dimension D2 and the level
number (Σ2(L)) statistics- can be a feature of a KAM
system. A further insight is that this does not require
cantori to be uniformly distributed over phase-space (as
in pseudo-integrable billiards [3]): we conclude that it
may suﬃce that typical trajectories all spend a long time
trapped in the fractal regions.

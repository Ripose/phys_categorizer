Abstract

We perform a gauge-transformation on the time-dependent Dirac equation

describing the evolution of an electron in a heavy-ion collision to remove the

explicit dependence on the long-range part of the interaction. We solve, in

an ultra-relativistic limit, the gauged-transformed Dirac equation using light-

front variables and a light-fronts representation, obtaining non-perturbative

results for the free pair-creation amplitudes in the collider frame. Our result

reproduces the result of second-order perturbation theory in the small charge

limit while non-perturbative eﬀects arise for realistic charges of the ions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Electron-positron pair production from the vacuum in strong electromagnetic ﬁelds is a

fundamental prediction of QED [1–3]. In heavy-ion collisions at energies near the Coulomb

barrier, quasi-bound molecular states are formed with binding energies which dive into

the negative-energy continuum, resulting in a resonance which decays into an electron-

positron pair [2,4–8].

In contrast, for ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at peripheral

impact parameters, the ions execute straight-line trajectories and reside near each other

for only a very short time. The high charge of the individual ions and the strong Lorentz

contraction combine to produce ﬁelds suﬃcient for electromagnetic pair production through

a qualitatively diﬀerent process. Large cross sections for electro-magnetic pair production

in these collisions were theoretically predicted [9] and experimentally observed [10–17].

In lowest-order perturbation theory, the amplitudes for pair production in heavy-ion colli-

sions are calculated from two-photon exchange diagrams [18]. The quantum ﬁeld theoretical

treatment of this process was reduced to a classical-ﬁeld approach [19]. Experimental obser-

vations of free pair production in the energy range around ten GeV per nucleon (in the col-

lider reference frame) are in agreement with second-order perturbation theory [10,12,14–16].

For lower energies of a few GeV per nucleon (collider frame), experimental results for free and

bound-free pair production show deviations from the predictions obtained from two-photon

exchange diagrams [11,13]. This is likely due to two-center Coulomb eﬀects [20,21]. In the

near future, larger ultra-relativistic energies above one hundred GeV per nucleon (collider

frame) will be available. New non-perturbative eﬀects may become important at colliding-

beam accelerators such as the Relativistic Heavy-ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven and

possibly the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. These non-perturbative eﬀects are the

subject of our present work.

Previous theoretical works on high-energy non-perturbative eﬀects considered unitar-

ity violation in lowest-order perturbation theory, multiple-pair production, and corrections

to production cross sections [22–32]. An open question, crucial for the beam stability, is

2

whether the non-perturbative eﬀects will enhance or reduce the cross section for bound-free

production, i.e. production with capture [30,32].

In a non-perturbative treatment, starting from the QED Lagrange density operator, the

Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for the quantum ﬁelds are equivalent, under physical

assumptions, to the one-particle Dirac equation interacting with classical, electromagnetic

ﬁelds [33]. Calculations of probabilities and correlations can then be reduced to solving the

two-center time-dependent Dirac equation, which describes the dynamics of an electron in

the classical ﬁeld of two relativistically moving charges.

In the ultra-relativistic limit, the ions are practically moving at the speed of light. The

classical electromagnetic ﬁeld of a massless charged particle was studied in Ref. [34].

It

can be described by pure gauge potentials, with diﬀerent gauges in diﬀerent regions of

space-time. The eikonal approximation was then reproduced from an exact solution of a

quantum-mechanical equation in this ﬁeld. A similar approach was recently used in target-

frame calculations of bound-free pair production, where a gauge transformation was used to

remove the long-range Coulomb eﬀects [29,32].

The use of gauge transformations is fundemental to these calculations. The term gauge

transformation, as used here, is not to be confused with a gauge-symmetry transformation

in which both the wave function and the ﬁelds are transformed so as to keep the equation of

motion invariant. Here, as well as in Refs. [24,35,36], for example, a space-time dependent

phase is used to transform either the wave function or the ﬁelds in order to obtain a diﬀerent

equation of motion. The connection between the solution of the original problem and the

gauge-transformed problem depends on the asymptotic (inﬁnite time) behavior of the gauge

function employed;

i.e. on the induced changes to the initial and ﬁnal states [24,35,36].

Gauge transformations should also be applied with care when used in calculations employing

truncated basis sets [35–37].

In this work, a gauge transformation is used to solve the two-center Dirac equation

describing an electron during a relativistic heavy-ion collision. A closed form expression for

the pair-production amplitudes in the ultra-relativistic limit is found. First, in section II,

3

the ultra-relativistic limit for the two-center Dirac equation is obtained and discussed. In

section III, exact and asymptotic relations between the physical amplitudes and the gauged

transformed ones are established. In section IV, the light-fronts representation is introduced

and the foundations are laid for the construction of the exact solution in section V, where the

perturbative limit is considered as well. The physical contents of our results and an outlook

for future applications are ﬁnally considered in section VI. Details of some derivations are

given in appendices.

II. AN ULTRA-RELATIVISTIC LIMIT TO THE TWO-CENTER

TIME-DEPENDENT DIRAC EQUATION

Consider a collision between two ions with charges ZA and ZB and velocities β ˆz and

β ˆz, respectively, moving parallel to each other at an impact parameter of 2~b (see Fig.

−
1). An external-ﬁeld approach to the inﬂuence of these ions on the vacuum is appropri-

ate for peripheral impact parameters (i.e. no nuclear interactions), heavy ions, and ultra-

relativistic energies, when to a very good approximation, the ions continue intact on their

parallel, straight-line trajectories. The two-center Dirac equation for an electron in the

time-dependent external ﬁeld of these ions is given by:

Consider the physical nature of this limit. A δ function over time alone would indicate

a sudden interaction of the ions with the vacuum.

In the gauge-transformed equation,

Eq. (8), with the interactions of Eqs. (11) and (12), as they move, the ions are continuously

interacting with the vacuum. Naturally, this interaction is singular on the trajectories of the

ions, as it was before the ultra-relativistic limit has been taken; but an additional singularity

is induced in the ultra-relativistic limit by the extreme Lorentz contraction of the ﬁeld. In

this limit, the interaction is inﬁnite on the two planes perpendicular to the ions trajectories,

and vanishes elsewhere.

In the following, we calculate pair production amplitudes using

Eq. (8) with the interactions in Eqs. (11) and (12). The region of large r⊥ is not properly

accounted for in this treatment, but contributions from this region to pair production are

assumed to be small.

The interactions in Eqs. (11) and (12) have zero range in the longitudinal direction and a

logarithmic behavior in the transverse direction, similar to the potential of a line of charge.

In the limit β

1, the two ions are moving at the speed of light and thus the interaction

planes described above coincide with the light fronts, given by z =

t (see Fig. 4). Finally,

III. ASYMPTOTIC SOLUTIONS AND TRANSITION AMPLITUDES

In scattering theory, characterized by free initial and ﬁnal states, a complete solution is

generally given by the set of asymptotic transition amplitudes between plane waves, (the

S-matrix).

In this section, we deﬁne the transition amplitudes, S(j)

k , for the electronic

spinor wave function

, i.e. for Eq. (1), and the transition amplitudes, A(j)

k , for the gauge

transformed wave function

Ψ

, i.e. for Eq. (8), using, as usual, initial and ﬁnal plane wave

states. Use of an initial condition of a single plane wave for Eq. (1) is somewhat subtle since

the theory is never free due to long-range Coulomb eﬀects [3]. This is an important point

when integrating the amplitudes to obtain predictions for physical observables. One should

properly account for actual initial and ﬁnal states for a given experiment.

A complete set of solutions of the free Dirac equation is given by the Dirac plane waves;

χp(~r, t)

. Each plane wave is characterized by three continuous and two discrete quantum

numbers; namely, the three components of the momentum, ~p, the sign of the energy, (we

The initial condition for Eq. (1), Eq. (20), and the initial condition for Eq. (8), Eq. (22),

correspond to diﬀerent initial physical states, as they are not related by the gauge trans-

formation in Eq. (7). A similiar comment is true for the ﬁnal states used in deﬁning the

amplitudes in Eqs. (21) and (23). In general, S(j)

k and A(j)

k are completely diﬀerent ampli-

tudes. They are related to each other by the gauge transformation of Eq. (7) in the following

should be questioned if applied with a truncated basis calculation [35–37].

A relation like Eq. (24) holds between any two amplitudes which are related by a gauge

transformation. If the gauge transformation U had been otherwise deﬁned so that it would

mality of the plane-waves would eliminate the double sum in Eq. (24), and the asymptotic

1 for ti → −∞

and tf → ∞

), the orthonor-

transition amplitudes S(j)

k and A(j)

k would be identical. Gauge transformations which share

this property have been described as exhibiting asymptotic gauge invariance [36]. Like-

wise, if the gauge transformation U would be independent of ~r for asymptotic times, (i.e.

U

exp(iCi) for ti → −∞

→

, and U

exp(iCf ) for tf →

→

∞

+

, where Ci and Cf are real

numbers), then the double sum in Eq. (24) would again be eliminated and the matrix ele-

ments of U in Eq. (24) would contribute only a single constant phase at asymptotic times.

In this case, the asymptotic transition probabilities derived from S(j)
k

and A(j)

k would be

identical [24].

The speciﬁc gauge transformation used here, Eq. (7), is not independent of space at

asymptotic times, as is shown in appendix B, and, as a result, does not exhibit asymptotic

gauge invariance for the amplitudes or the probabilities derived from them. However, this

gauge does have an additional property which relates S(j)
k

and A(j)
k

in a way more useful

than Eq. (24). It is shown in appendix B that in the special case of symmetric collisions,

with ZA = ZB, S(j)
k

zero-order term is A(j)
k .

can be expressed as a series expansion in powers of 1/tf and 1/

IV. THE SHARP DIRAC EQUATION IN THE LIGHT-FRONTS

REPRESENTATION

In this section, the sharp Dirac equation, Eq. (8), with the limiting form of the interaction

in Eqs. (11), and (12), will be further simpliﬁed by changing into light-front variables and

by introducing a new representation for the Dirac spinors, the light-fronts representation.

This is an appropriate choice of variables and representation, since, in the ultra-relativistic

limit of Eq. (5), the interactions are conﬁned to the light fronts.

9

A. Deﬁnitions and notations

In terms of light-front variables, space-time and energy-momentum are described by the

4-vectors (~r⊥, τ+, τ−) and (~p⊥, p+, p−), where

The sign and absolute value of (p+ + p−)/2 are λp and εp, respectively. Equation (27) like

Eq. (17) deﬁnes the energy-shell. These variables were often used previously for quantization

on one of the two light fronts, τ+ = 0 or τ− = 0 [40]. For the problem considered here, it is

useful to keep the symmetry between τ+ and τ−.

The projection operators (I4 ±

ˇαz)/2 acquire a simple form and the interaction is diago-

nalized by introducing the light-fronts representation for the Dirac matrices,

C. The discontinuity across the light fronts

It is standard procedure in wave-mechanics to form piece-wise solutions by satisfying

continuity relations at the boundaries between free regions. It was shown in Refs. [32,34]

that a δ-function singular interaction at a light front results in a discontinuity in the electron

wave function which is given by a space-dependent phase shift. The proof is reviewed in

appendix C, where it is shown that for our case of Eq. (35), the discontinuity is

These phase shifts are derived from Eq. (35) in general for any A(~r⊥,~b) and B(~r⊥,~b), i.e.

any functional dependence on the perpendicular coordinate. Here, A(~r⊥,~b) and B(~r⊥,~b) are

given by Eqs. (38, 39).

Due to this space dependent phase-shift, the transverse momentum is not conserved and

the Fourier components of Eq. (40) are mixed when the singularities at the light fronts are

crossed,

V. A PIECE-WISE SOLUTION TO THE SHARP DIRAC EQUATION

In this section, the formalism that was introduced in section IV is used to obtain the

transition amplitudes between asymptotic plane waves, A(j)

k , deﬁned in section III.

The singular interaction on the planes perpendicular to the trajectories of the ions, cut

space-time along the light fronts into four regions, as is shown in Fig. 5. A piece-wise

solution is deﬁned oﬀ the light fronts by

g±(~q⊥; τ+, τ−)

τ+ < 0 and τ− < 0, (i)= II for τ+ > 0 and τ− < 0, (i)= III for τ+ < 0 and τ− > 0, and

(i)= IV for τ+ > 0 and τ− > 0. In each region, the wave function is continuous and solves

the local free Dirac equation. At any time, except for t

, the wave function extends

→ ±∞

in space through three (or two, at t = 0) of these regions. The solution presented here is

not complete in the sense that it does not include the solution on the light fronts; τ+ = 0

and τ− = 0 are excluded. The physics on the light fronts may contribute to bound-free pair

production. Thus, our present work is limited to free pair production.

It is a well known fact that two ions are needed in order to create an electron-positron

pair. This can also be seen here. In the presence of ion B alone, for example, Eqs. (56) give

the solution for τ+ > 0, including the asymptotic solution at tf → ∞
wave then gives a conservation law for the positive light-front momentum. Likewise, in the

A direct result from k+ = j+ or k− = j− is that the sign of the energy of the electron is the

same before and after the collision. Thus, our formalism satisﬁes the known result that the

which is the space between the ions (

t < z < t) after the collision (t > 0), i.e. when the

ions are already moving apart. It is shown below that the sign of the energy can change and

pairs may be created in transitions from the initial state in region I (ti → −∞

) to the ﬁnal

The solution of the free Dirac equation in region IV is complicated by the non-trivial

boundary conditions on the light fronts. Applying Eq. (52) again for the discontinuity across

τ+ and Eq. (53) for the discontinuity across τ−, we cross from regions II and III into region

IV to obtain on the hyper-surfaces adjacent to the light fronts,

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

We have used a gauge transformation to obtain a useful ultra-relativistic limit for the two-

center Dirac equation, which allows for an exact solution oﬀ the planes perpendicular to the

ions’ trajectories, i.e. oﬀ the light fronts. In general, the amplitudes of the gauge-transformed

Dirac equation are related to the amplitudes of the original equation in a non-trivial way

due to long-range Coulomb eﬀects. For symmetric collisions, and calculations in the collider

frame, some of these long-range eﬀects cancel. The two diﬀerent amplitudes are then related

by a series expansion, and, to leading order, they are equal.

The amplitudes were calculated here in the ultra-relativistic limit, assuming γ to be

large. No assumption was made on the value of the charge times the ﬁne-structure constant

Zα. When taking the limit of small Zα, we are able to show a complete agreement with the

ultra-relativistic limit of the expression obtained from standard second-order perturbation

theory [18].

In second-order perturbation theory, pair production is described as a two

photon exchange process in which each ion exchanges one photon with a negative-energy

electron. The negative energy electron is kicked oﬀ its energy shell by the ﬁrst interaction

and then kicked back to the energy shell by the second ion, but with a positive energy.

The two diagrams that contribute to the amplitude diﬀer in the time order of these photon

exchanges, or ‘kicks’. Our result, which provides a very similar physical picture of pair

production as a ‘two-kicks’ process, is obtained in the ultra-relativistic limit within a rather

diﬀerent, and completely non-perturbative approach.

In our work, the electromagnetic ﬁelds of the ions are conﬁned to the light fronts by

the extreme Lorentz contraction and by a choice of a particular gauge designed to remove

the long-range Coulomb eﬀects. In this gauge, as the velocity of the ions approaches the

velocity of light, each ion carries with it, perpendicular to its trajectory, a wall of singular

electromagnetic interaction. An initial plane wave in the space between the approaching

ions acquires a space-dependent phase shift as it is swept by this singular-interaction wall.

A single plane wave between the ions gives a distribution of local plane waves in the space

20

behind each ion. Had there been only one ion, no transition would be allowed between

the negative-energy continuum and the positive-energy continuum, i.e. no pairs could be

produced. Pairs are produced because, as the ions move past each other, the two phase-

shift planes collide. After the peripheral collision, as the ions move apart, the solution in the

space between them is determined by the non-trivial boundary conditions at the light fronts.

The main result of this work, the exact integral representation for the free pair creation

amplitudes of Eq. (69), is ﬁnally obtained in this framework by calculating the transition

currents ﬂowing from the light fronts into the space between the separating ions. The two

terms correspond to the two time orderings of the interaction of the two phase-shift walls

with the electronic wave function. In the perturbative limit of a small coupling constant,

the eﬀect of the singular ﬁeld perpendicular to each ion reduces to a single photon exchange.

For ﬁnite charges of the ions, the perturbative linear dependence of the amplitudes on each

charge is replaced by non-perturbative, nontrivial phases in our integral representation.

Numerical evaluation of the non-perturbative eﬀects, diﬀerential cross sections, and ap-

plications to multiple pair production will be considered in future work.

Eq. (24), was established between them. However, this relation is not always useful as it

involves inﬁnite integrals and sums over the complete plane-wave basis set. In this appendix,

a series expansion in inverse powers of the asymptotic time will be shown to relate S(j)

k and

in a simpler way for symmetric collisions and calculations in the collider frame.

APPENDIX C: THE DISCONTINUITY AT THE LIGHT FRONTS

In this appendix, the discontinuities of the spinor wave function at the light fronts (at

τ+ = 0 and at τ− = 0, excluding only τ+ = τ− = 0) are deduced from Eq. (35). Previous

derivations of the discontinuity of a wave function due to an ultra-relativistic charge are

This Heavyside step-function, space-dependent, phase discontinuity was previously ob-

tained in Ref. [32]. In earlier work [34], a gauge transformation was used to establish the

fact that the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a charge which is moving at the speed of light can

be equivalently given by gauge potentials with a δ-function singularity at the light front,

or by gauge potentials with only a step-function discontinuity there. The wave function

of a particle interacting with this ﬁeld is discontinuous or continuous, depending on the

gauge choice. We choose to work with such a gauge that would give a sharp interaction

and a discontinuous spinor wave function, yet we have used here other gauges to ﬁnd the

discontinuities in an explicit form.

APPENDIX D: THE MOMENTUM-TRANSFER DISTRIBUTION

When the singularities at the light fronts are crossed, the transverse momentum changes.

The distribution for this momentum change is given in section IV by Eq. (54),

APPENDIX E: THE TRANSITION CURRENT

As we are unaware of an appropriate reference, we prove in this appendix that the

transition 4-current density deﬁned in Eq. (63) is conserved. In fact, any two solutions of

the free Dirac equation can be used to deﬁne a conserved current in a similar way. This

proof is very similar to the one found in textbooks proving the probability current to be

conserved [2].

Both χk and ψ(j) solve in region IV the free Dirac equation in the Dirac representation

APPENDIX F: APPLICATION OF GAUSS’ THEOREM

As appendix E shows, the transition 4-current, deﬁned in Eq. (63), is a conserved quan-

tity,

Integrating Eq. (F1) over any empty space-time hyper-volume, V , and applying Guass’

theorem to convert the volume integral into a surface integral over the hyper-surface S

enclosing V , in general gives,

where the unit 4-vector nµ is deﬁned as the outward pointing normal to S.

For our purposes, it is useful to apply Eq. (F2) to the space-time region IV, deﬁned in

Fig. 5 by τ± > 0. The closed hyper-surface S enclosing region IV is made of the following

open hyper-surfaces: (i) t = tf →

where use was made of the fact that in any physical situation, i.e. for a square-integrable

wavepacket, the currents vanish as ~r

. The hyper-surfaces (iv) and (v) do not contribute

→ ∞

to the integral of Eq. (F2). The factors of 2 arise from the Jacobian relating the original

diﬀerentials to the diﬀerentials for the light-front variables, and the negative sign in the

second and third terms arise because the unit normal vectors ˆn± are directed outside the

volume V , i.e. J

ˆn± =

J±. This completes our proof of Eq. (65).

FIG. 1. Schematic diagram depicting a relativistic heavy-ion collision of two charges, ZA and

ZB, in the center-of-velocity frame with impact parameter 2b and velocity β. Lorentz contraction

is extreme, so the ions are depicted as oblate spheroids.

FIG. 2. Shown is the scalar component of the Lorentz-gauge interaction, V 0, for two diﬀerent

energies, (a) γ = 10 (CERN-SPS energies), and (b) γ = 100 (RHIC energies), plotted as a function

of a narrow range of the z-coordinate for t = 0, ~b = (1, 0), and ~r⊥ = (2, 0). Notice that away from

the vicinity of z = 0 this interaction is insensitive to the change in the energy of the ion.

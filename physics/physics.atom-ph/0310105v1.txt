Abstract

We suggest a new adiabatic approach for description of three charged
particles in the continuum. This approach is based on the Coulomb-
Fourier transformation (CFT) of three body Hamiltonian, which al-
lows to develop a scheme, alternative to Born-Oppenheimer one. The
approach appears as an expansion of the kernels of corresponding in-
tegral transformations in terms of small mass-ratio parameter. To be
speciﬁc, the results are presented for the system ppe in the continuum.
The wave function of a such system is compared with that one which
is used for estimation of the rate for triple reaction p + p + e
d + ν,
which take place as a step of pp-cycle in the center of the Sun. The
problem of microscopic screening for this particular reaction is dis-
cussed.

1 Introduction.

An accurate treatment of three charged particles in the continuum
at low relative energies represents till now a very diﬃcult problem
which is actual in many areas of physics. Indeed, only some special
cases with speciﬁc properties of the system has been considered in

1

the literature. In this respect one should mention papers [1, 2] where
the asymptotic solution for the three-body wave function has been
obtained for conﬁgurations when all interparticle distances are much
larger of the characteristic size of the system. An alternative limiting
case considered in [3] corresponds to conﬁgurations where one Jacobi
coordinate is much larger than the other one. The near threshold
breakup of hydrogen by proton (or electron) studied in [4] is another
example of approximative solution of three body Schr¨odinger equation
obtained so far for three charged particles in the continuum.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a new adiabatic expansion
for three-body Hamiltonian for the system consisting of one light and
two heavy particles. The asymptotic behavior of the wave-function
with respect to the coordinate of light particle will be presented in
the framework of this new adiabatic expansion. We use the Coulomb-
Fourier transform formalism proposed in [5] to make a unitary trans-
formation of the Hamiltonian, which leads to a convenient represen-
tation, where, for example, one long-range interactions is eliminated.
The known explicit form of eigenfunctions allows us to construct the
useful integral representation of interaction potentials for transformed
Hamiltonian. The important feature of this representation for poten-
tials is the appearance of universal integral with the integrand contain-
ing the exponential factor, proportional to square root of mass ratio
me/mp of light (electron) and heavy (proton) particles. The
τ
natural power series in τ of this integral then generate power series
representation of the transformed Hamiltonian what is the basis for
our new variant of adiabatic representation of the problem. As the
ﬁrst stage, in this paper we study the solution of the problem taking
into account terms up to O(τ 2) order.

The paper is organized as following. Section 2 plays the central
role and includes formulation of the problem, description of necessary
portions of Coulomb-Fourier transformation. Here we give as exact
formulas for CF transformed Hamiltonian for ppe system as well as
derive the expansion of matrix elements of the Hamiltonian and wave
function as power series in τ 2. Some technical details concerning eval-
uation of singular integrals from the main tex is placed in Appendix.
Third section contains application of approximation for three-body
wave function obtained in Section 2 to description of some reactions
of pp cycle. Short conclusion summarizes the paper.

In the paper we use units such that ¯h = c = 1, for the unit electric

charge the symbol e is used. Three-dimensional vectors are denoted by
x, y, k, p... and its modules and respective unite vectors by x, y, k, p...
and by ˆx, ˆy, ˆk, ˆp... . Sometimes we combine pairs of three-dimensional
k, p
vectors in six-dimensional ones as X =

Hamiltonian and solution

The ppe system where p is proton and e is electron with masses mp
me) respectively is considered. Number 1 we assign to

electron whereas 2 and 3 to protons. The Hamiltonian of the system in
the center of mass frame using mass-renormalized Jacobi coordinates
can be written in the form

Mass-renormalized charge factors ni are deﬁned by the formulas ni =

ejek
charges and µij stands for reduced mass of a pair of particles ij, i.e.
µij = mimj/(mi + mj). Introducing proton and electron masses into
this formula we get µ23 = mp/2, µ31 = memp/(me + mp), µ12 = µ31.
Before proceed further, let us make three clarifying comments.
First, throughout the paper we systematically use a convention that
indices of any pair of particles ij are considered as a part of triad ijk
which itself is a cyclic permutation of 1, 2, 3. Second, let us recall that
mass-renormalized Jacobi set xi, yi is deﬁned in such a way that the
vector xi up to the factor
2µjk is proportional to the relative position
vector of particles j and k and the vector yi is the position vector of
particle i with respect to the center of mass of corresponding two-
body sybsystem. There are three possible sets xi, yi, i = 1, 2, 3 and
diﬀerent sets are related to each other by kinematic rotation relations

ij, where ǫijk is fully antisymmetric tensor normal-

uation, i.e. not neglecting me with respect to mp, making some-
times simpliﬁcations for illustrative purposes, as for example µ31 =
memp/(me + mp) = me(1 + O(me/mp)).

Now let us turn to the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation

HΨ = EΨ

(3)

for three particles in the continuum (E > 0). To this end we will
construct a special representation. As the basis of this representation
we take the eigenfunctions Ψc0(X, P), i.e. Hc0Ψc0 = P2Ψc0, of the
operator

where in the last case we have factored out the small parameter τ 2 to
show explicitly that the last term in (13) is as small as τ 2.

The structure of the Hamiltonian (13) suggests now the natural
perturbative scheme for solution of Schr¨odinger equation (6). Let us
represent the wave-function ˆΨ as power series in τ 2

ˆΨ = ˆΨ0 + τ 2 ˆΨ2 + τ 4 ˆΨ4 + ...

The scheme (17, 18) has a remarkable property, namely, the solution of
the three-body problem in framework of this scheme can be obtained in
terms of solutions of two-body problems. Indeed, equation (17) allows
the separation of variables, so that its solution is reduced to the solu-
tion of respective two-body equations, at the same time the solution

(16)

(17)

of inhomogeneous equations (18) can be obtained in terms of Green’s
function of the operator ˆH0 + ˆVs + ˆV c
ef f which can be constructed from
two-body Green’s functions due to separability of variables.

For the speciﬁc case of three particles in the continuum we are
considering the solution scheme outlined above yields the following
results. The solution of the ﬁrst equation (17) reads

Now one can see, that the structure of our solution (16) and respec-
tive series in τ 2 for Ψ(X, Pin) generated from (22) by (16) and the
structure of the representation for the Hamiltonian (13) outline the
framework of our approach as an alternative to Born-Oppenheimer
one.
It is worth mentioning here, that the formalism given above
is rather general and with minor evident modiﬁcations is applicable
for the three charged particle systems for the case of diﬀerent masses
when the mass of one particle is signiﬁcantly smaller than the masses
of others.

Before proceed further, let us give some explicit formulas for ap-
proximation to the wave function Ψ(X, Pin) generated by our com-
plete formal solution which we will use in the next Section discussing
some astrophysical reactions. Introducing (19) and (21) into (22) we

The complete investigation of properties of the solutions to (17,18)
is out of the scope of this paper and will be made elsewhere. Below
in this section, we consider two points which plays the key role for
the formalism, namely the singular structure of operator ˆW and the
structure of correction term ˆΨ2 (and consequently Ψ2) which possesses
the most important properties speciﬁc for all correction terms ˆΨ2l.

The kernels of the operators ˆW (l) in (15) are given in terms of
singular integrals (10). These integrals obviously can be computed in
terms of distributions (generalized functions) as it could be seen from
(10) in the trivial case l = 0 which yields L(0)(P, P′) = δ(k1 −
k′1).

The general case of arbitrary l in (10) is considered in the Appendix

This formula describes the correction term Ψ2 for the ppe system when
strong pp interaction is neglected and at the same time is approxima-
tion to the term Ψ2 in the general case.

The formula (32) is useful for constructing the coordinate asymp-

Here by O
we have denoted terms corresponding to derivatives
of exponential factor in (32). The order of this terms shows the range
of validity of the asymptotics (33), i.e. y kin
pin has to be small, what
in terms of masses must be equivalent to the fact that yτ 2 has to be
small. Let us emphasize that all treatment above devoted to consider-
ation of three body charged particles at kinetic energies, comparable
with corresponding potential energy, which means that Coulomb in-
teractions are essential. In this situation for the systems, consisting
from heavy and light particles, one can develop the adiabatic descrip-
tion, which actually means smallnes of momentums of heavy and light
particles ratio kin
pin . This smallnes obviously appear due to the small
mass ratio parameter τ , introduced above.

Therefore in each ﬁxed order of expansion in small parameter τ

one should neglect also by all terms, proportional to the ratio kin
pin .

3 Astrophysical Examples

Now let us discuss ways of describing some reactions of the pp-cycle
on the Sun, which can be done on the ground of 3-body wave function
In other words, we will consider situations when in
given by (23).
the initial state the system consists of three charged particles in the
continuum and the mass of one of them is much smaller than other
masses.

The ﬁrst example gives the reaction

p + p + e

d + ν

(34)

→

13

considered in [6]. As it follows from the form of the main term in the
right hand side of (23), with very good accuracy we have separation
of the Jacobi coordinates in the wave function of the initial state for
the reaction (34). This means that the rate of three-body process (34)
can be expressed in terms of a binary process

p + p

d + e+ + ν

→

(35)

This is just the main result of paper [6]. Now it becomes clear that
the physical background of the above result from the point of view of
the few-body theory consists in two points:

a) the system has two heavy and one light particle such that the
1 and therefore one can neglect the second term in

parameter m
M ≪
the right-hand side of (23).

b) heavy particles are slow enough to neglect higher partial waves
in their relative motion. One should emphasize that free ”eﬀective
charge of the initial nuclear system” Z, introduced in [6], can now be
ﬁxed to value Z = 2 which is supported by the structure of (23).

Let us consider another example of 3-body initial state

p +7 Be + e,

(36)

which can produce 8Be or 7Li nuclei via the following reactions

p +7 Be + e

8Be + e (γ)

7Li + ν + p

ր

ց

First, from the previous discussion one can see that due to diﬀer-
ent masses of heavy particles in this case the contribution from the
linear term τ is nonzero in contrast to the p + p + e system, and this
contribution should be estimated.

If the electron in state (36) is in the continuum, then again due to
the separation of Jacobi coordinate in the ﬁrst term of (23) the rate
of the proton capture from the initial three-body state (36) can be
expressed via the rate of the binary reaction p +7 Be

8 B + γ.

However, the rate of the electron capture from the initial three-
body state (36), as it follows from (23), (modiﬁed for the state (36)),
will be deﬁned by the Coulomb wave function of the electron moving
in the Coulomb ﬁeld with the charge Z = 5 instead of Z = 4 for the

→

14

capture from the two-body state 7Be+e. This means that the produc-
tion rate of 7Li from the three-body state (36) cannot be expressed
via the binary (e+7Be
7Li+ν) reaction rate. Roughly speaking, the
ratio of these rates will be proportional to the ratio of the correspond-
ing electron Coulomb functions at energy in the center of the Sun Es.
In other words,

Now let us discuss the problem of screening of the Coulomb in-
(cid:12)
teraction between two protons for the system p + p + e. We restrict
ourselves by lowest order in the ratio me/mp for the three-body wave
function, i.e. consider only ﬁrst term in the (23). It is evident, that
the screening eﬀect in this approximation appears due to the elec-
, R being
tronic wave function ψc(p, y), where y =
the distance between protons and r being the distance between elec-
tron and one of the protons. Taking the asymptotics of this function
r, one can see that the Coulomb phases of
in the region where R
pp wave function and electronic wave function can cancel each other
for the speciﬁc conﬁgurations of initial momentums k and p of three-
body system under consideration. Hence the resulting motion of two
protons in this conﬁguration would be described by plane wave, which
means the total screening eﬀect.

4 Conclusion

In conclusion we emphasize, that the CF-transformed three-body Hamil-
tonian (13) for the system of two heavy and one light particles can be
used for realization of adiabatic expansion which is alternative to the
Born-Oppenheimer one. This approach allows to treat screening ef-
fects on the microscopic level. In astrophysical examples it was shown,
that in the lowest order of small parameter τ , it is possible for some
reactions only express rates of 3-body processes in terms of binary
ones.

Abstract
Hyperﬁne quenching rates of the lowest-energy metastable 3P0 and 3P2 states of Mg, Ca, Sr, and
Yb atoms are computed. The calculations are carried out using ab initio relativistic many-body
methods. The computed lifetimes may be useful for designing novel ultra-precise optical clocks
and trapping experiments with the 3P2 fermionic isotopes. The resulting natural widths of the
3P0 −1S0 clock transition are 0.44 mHz for 25Mg, 2.2 mHz for 43Ca, 7.6 mHz for 87Sr, 43.5 mHz for
171Yb, and 38.5 mHz for 173Yb. Compared to the bosonic isotopes, the lifetime of the 3P2 states in
fermionic isotopes is noticeably shortened by the hyperﬁne quenching but still remains long enough
for trapping experiments.

INTRODUCTION

This work is motivated by emerging experiments with cold divalent atoms Mg, Ca, Sr
and Yb [1]. For example, the recently attained Bose-Einstein condensate of the ground-state
Yb [2] may oﬀer new insights into the physics of degenerate quantum gases due to a vast
number of available isotopes and relative simplicity of molecular potentials. As to the 3P2
metastable states (see Fig. 1), it was realized that the non-scalar nature of the 3P2 states may
be used to overcome the unfeasibility of magnetic trapping of the spherically-symmetric 1S0
ground states [3, 4, 5, 6]. Knowing radiative lifetimes of the other, 3P0, metastable states is
required in developing the next generation of ultraprecise optical atomic clocks [7, 8, 9, 10].
Here the clockwork is based on cold atoms conﬁned to sites of an engineered optical lattice.
The lifetime determines the natural width of the clock transition between the ground and
the 3P0 state.

FIG. 1: Lowest-lying energy levels of Mg (n=3), Ca (n=4), Sr (n=5), and Yb (n=6), relevant to
the radiative decay of the nsnp 3P0,2 states. The hyperﬁne quenching predominantly is caused by
the admixture of the nsnp 3P1 and nsnp 1P1 states.

For all bosonic isotopes of Mg, Ca, Sr, and Yb, the nuclear spin I vanishes and these
isotopes lack hyperﬁne structure. For bosonic isotopes the 3P0 state may decay only via very
weak multi-photon (e.g., E1-M1) transitions. However, for fermionic isotopes (Table I),
I 6= 0, a new radiative decay channel becomes available due to the hyperﬁne interaction
(HFI). The HFI, although small, admixes atomic levels of the total angular momentum
J = 1 thus opening an electric-dipole branch to the ground state. The resulting HFI-
induced E1 decays do determine the lifetimes of the 3P0 states. As to the 3P2 states, here
the single-photon decays are allowed, but being of non-E1 character, are very weak. The
lifetimes are long and range from 15 seconds for Yb to 2 hours for Ca [11, 12]. As we
demonstrate here, depending on an isotope, the hyperﬁne quenching of the 3P2 states is
either comparable to or is much faster than the small non-E1 rates.

A detailed theoretical analysis of the hyperﬁne quenching has been limited so far to
astrophysically-important He, Be and Mg and their isoelectronic sequences [13, 14, 15, 16].
The hyperﬁne quenching of the 3P0 states of Sr and Yb has been estimated in Refs. [7, 10].
Here we carry out ab initio relativistic many-body atomic structure calculations to extend
and reﬁne these previous studies. We ﬁnd that the resulting natural widths of the 3P0 −1S0
clock transition are 0.44 mHz for 25Mg, 2.2 mHz for 43Ca, 7.6 mHz for 87Sr, 43.5 mHz
for 171Yb, and 38.5 mHz for 173Yb. Compared to the bosonic isotopes, the lifetime of the

3P2 states in fermionic isotopes is noticeably shortened by the hyperﬁne quenching but still
remains long enough for trapping experiments.

The paper is organized as follows. First, in Section II we derive the hyperﬁne quenching
rates using perturbation theory. The solution of many-body atomic problem and numerical
details are given in Section III. Finally, we present the results, compare with the previous
calculations, and draw the conclusions in Section IV. Unless noted otherwise, atomic units
(~ = |e| = me ≡ 1) are used throughout.

II. DERIVATION OF HYPERFINE QUENCHING RATES

In the presence of nuclear moments, the total electronic angular momentum J no longer
remains a good quantum number. The atomic energy levels are characterized instead by the
total angular momentum F = J + I. Nevertheless, the coupling of the electronic and the
nuclear momenta is small and in this section we employ the ﬁrst-order perturbation theory
in the magnetic-dipole hyperﬁne interaction to compute the modiﬁed atomic wave functions
of the 3P0;2 levels. With these perturbed wave functions the hyperﬁne quenching rates are
obtained with the conventional Fermi golden rule.

Before proceeding with the outlined derivation, we notice that in this problem there are
two types of perturbations: the hyperﬁne interaction and the interaction with the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld. Here we treat the HFI as the dominant interaction, determine the hyperﬁne
structure ﬁrst, and as the next step compute the lifetimes. This approach is valid as long as
the radiative width of the 3P1 level is much smaller than the ﬁne-structure intervals between
the components of the 3PJ multiplet [14]. We veriﬁed that this inequality holds for all the
atoms under consideration.

We develop the formalism in terms of the hyperﬁne states |γ(IJ)F MF i. Here the angular
momenta I and J are conventionally coupled to produce a state of deﬁnite total momentum
F and its projection MF , and γ encapsulates all other atomic quantum numbers. In the
ﬁrst order of perturbation theory in the hyperﬁne interaction, HHFI, the correction to the
hyperﬁne sub-level |γ(IJ)F MF i of the metastable state |γJi reads

|γ(IJ)F MF i(1) =

|γ′(IJ ′)F MF i

Xγ′J ′

where E (γJ) are the energies of atomic states. In the above expression, we have taken into
account that HHFI is a scalar, so the total angular momentum F and its projection MF are

conserved. In general, the hyperﬁne coupling Hamiltonian, HHFI, may be represented as a
sum over multipole nuclear moments M(k) of rank k combined with the even-parity electronic
coupling operators T (k) of the same rank so that the total interaction is rotationally and P–
invariant. For the hyperﬁne quenching of the J = 0 states via couplings to rapidly decaying
J = 1 states, we may truncate the HHFI at the magnetic-dipole part

HHFI =

(cid:19)

(2)

Here µ(1) is the operator of the nuclear magnetic moment, µN is the nuclear magneton, and
T (1) is a relevant operator acting in the electronic space.

While for the nsnp 3P0 the truncation of the HFI Hamiltonian at the nuclear magnetic-
dipole contribution (2) is rigorously justiﬁed due to the selection rules, for the nsnp 3P2
states such a truncation requires a special consideration.
Indeed, the next leading term
in the multipole expansion of HHFI is due to the nuclear electric quadrupole moment. The
associated electronic tensor of rank 2 can also admix levels of J = 1 symmetry and contribute
to the hyperﬁne quenching. This quadrupole contribution does not vanish for isotopes with
I ≥ 1, i.e., it may modify the nsnp 3P2 for all the isotopes listed in the Table I, except for
171Yb. Our truncation of the HFI Hamiltonian will lead to a small “systematic” error for
the nsnp 3P2 hyperﬁne quenching rates and we will return to this point in the conclusion.

With the magnetic-dipole contribution, Eq. (2), the required mixing matrix element in

Eq. (1) is

where µ are the nuclear magnetic moments, compiled in Table I.

Given the correction to the wavefunction, Eq.(1), we derive the hyperﬁne quenching rate
using the standard formalism. The rate of spontaneous emission (a → b) for an electric-
dipole radiation is

where α ≈ 1/137 is the ﬁne structure constant, ωab = Ea − Eb is the transition frequency,
and D is the electric-dipole operator. Summing over all possible Fb and magnetic quantum
numbers Mb of the ﬁnal state, while disregarding small F -dependent energy correction, one
obtains

For the case at hand, the initial state is the HFI-perturbed nsnp 3PJ , (J 6= 1) state, and the
ﬁnal state is the ground ns2 1S0 state. Taking into account Eq.(1), we arrive at the hyperﬁne

III. SOLVING ATOMIC MANY-BODY PROBLEM

The ab initio relativistic atomic-structure calculations employed here are similar to com-
putations of electric-dipole amplitudes for the alkaline-earth atoms [17] and hyperﬁne struc-
ture constants and electric-dipole amplitudes for ytterbium [11, 18]. Here we only brieﬂy
recap the main features of this method. We consider Mg, Ca, Sr and Yb as atoms with two
valence electrons outside the closed-shell cores. Strong repulsion between the two valence
electrons is treated non-perturbatevely using the conﬁguration-interaction (CI) method. The
core-valence and core-core correlations are taken into account with the help of the many-
body perturbation theory (MBPT) method.
In the following we refer to this combined
approach as the CI+MBPT method [19].

In the CI+MBPT approach, the energies and the wave functions are determined from

the eigenvalue equation in the model space of the valence electrons

where the eﬀective Hamiltonian is deﬁned as

Heﬀ(Ep) |Φpi = Ep |Φpi ,

Heﬀ(E) = HFC + Σ(E).

Here HFC is the relativistic two-electron Hamiltonian in the frozen core approximation and
Σ(E) is the energy-dependent core-polarization correction. The all-order operator Σ(E)
completely accounts for the second order correlation correction to the energies. The omitted
diagrams in higher orders may be accounted for indirectly by adjusting the eﬀective Hamil-
tonian [17, 20]. Namely, one introduces an energy shift δ and replaces Σ(E) with Σ(E − δ).
The parameter δ is determined semi-empirically from a ﬁt of the resulting theoretical energy
levels to experimental spectrum.

Using the eﬀective Hamiltonian we ﬁnd the wave functions of the ground and the 3PJ
states. Further we apply the technique of eﬀective all-order (“dressed”) operators to cal-
culations of the matrix elements. Technically, we employ the random-phase approximation
(RPA). The RPA sequence of diagrams describes a shielding of externally applied ﬁeld by
the core electrons. This is the level of approximation employed here for electric-dipole ma-
trix elements. The hyperﬁne, T (1), matrix elements required more sophisticated approach:

for this operator we additionally incorporated smaller corrections (e.g., normalization and
structural radiation; the details can be found in Ref. [18]). For the heaviest and more
computationally demanding Yb, the corrections to the eﬀective hyperﬁne operator tend to
cancel [18], and we have simpliﬁed the calculations for Yb by using the bare T (1) operator.
To demonstrate the quality of the constructed wave functions and the accuracy of the
eﬀective-operator approach, in Table II we present the calculated magnetic-dipole hyperﬁne
structure constants A for the 3P1,2 states. These constants are expressed in terms of ex-
pectation values of HHFI. As seen from the Table II the diﬀerences between the calculated
and the experimental values, even for heavy Yb, do not exceed 1%. Further the sums SJ ,
Eq. (7), are computed in the framework of Sternheimer-Dalgarno-Lewis method [27, 28]. At
the heart of this method is the recasting of the sums SJ in the form

where |δΨi satisﬁes the inhomogeneous Schrodinger equation

SJ = hnsnp 3PJ ||T (1)

eﬀ ||δΨi,

Heﬀ − E(nsnp 3PJ)
(cid:0)

|δΨi = Deﬀ|ns2 1S0i .

(cid:1)
It is worth noting that because the eﬀective operators act in the valence model space, the
|δΨi solution encompasses only the excitations of the valence electrons to higher valence
states. The unaccounted for core excitations involve large energy denominators and we
disregard their contributions.

IV. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

To reiterate the discussion of the previous section, we carry out the calculations in several
logical steps. First, we solve the CI+MBPT eigenvalue problem (9) and determine the
ground and the nsnp 3PJ state wavefunctions and energies. At the next step, we compute the
dressed E1-operator Deﬀ and solve the inhomogeneous equation (12). Finally, we calculate
the required sums SJ , Eqs.(7),(11), and determine the hyperﬁne quenching rates, Eq. (6).

The computed values of the isotope-independent sums S0 and S2 for Mg, Ca, Sr, and Yb
are presented in Table III. The sums grow larger for heavier atoms due to increasing matrix
elements of the hyperﬁne interaction (see Table II). A direct investigation of the sums shows
that the contributions of both nsnp 3P1 and nsnp 1P1 intermediate states are comparable.
The triplet state is separated by just a ﬁne-structure interval from the metastable states,
but its E1 matrix element with the singlet ground state vanishes non-relativistically. For the
singlet state, the situation is reversed: compared to the triplet contribution, the involved
energy denominator is much larger, but the electric-dipole matrix element is allowed.

With the determined values of SJ and Eq.(6), we obtain the hyperﬁne quenching rates for
the metastable 3P0 and 3P2 states. The resulting rates are listed in Table IV. The tabulated
decay rates for the 3P2 states require some explanation. First of all, as follows from Eq.(6)
the quenching rates depend on the total angular momentum F of the hyperﬁne substate.
Although, in general, the total angular momentum F ranges from |J − I| to J + I, the
6j-symbol in Eq.(6) imposes a stronger restriction, |I − 1| ≤ F ≤ I + 1. This requirement
can be tracked to the selection rule for the electric-dipole transition amplitude between the
ground state (Jg = 0, Fg = I) and the intermediate state which has the same F as the
original hyperﬁne state (see Eq. (1)). Keeping this restriction in mind, in Table IV we have
listed the quenching rates only for such E1-allowed values of F .

We also remind the reader that in our analysis we have disregarded the contributions of
the quadrupole and higher-order nuclear magnetic moments. While for the J = 0 states
this truncation is rigorously justiﬁed, for the J = 2 states the quadrupole contribution is
generally present and becomes increasingly important for heavier atoms. Its relative role
may be roughly estimated by forming a ratio of the relevant electric-quadrupole, B, and the
magnetic-dipole, A, hyperﬁne-structure constants. The ratio B/A for the nsnp 3P2 states
is less or in the order of 0.1 for isotopes of Mg, Ca, and Sr, but is larger than unity for
173Yb. We expect that the quadrupole correction will be signiﬁcant for 173Yb. However, for
the 171Yb isotope, I = 1/2 and the nuclear moments beyond the magnetic-dipole moment
vanish, justifying the validity of the truncation.

Based on better than 1% accuracy of the ab initio hyperﬁne constants (Table II) and
energy levels [17, 18] we expect that the computed hyperﬁne quenching rates for the 3P0
states are accurate within at least a few per cent. For the 3P2 states of alkaline-earth
atoms the main source of uncertainty is due to the neglected nuclear quadrupole moment
contributions; the overall accuracy should be worse than that.

In Table IV we also compare the computed rates with the results from the literature. For
Mg the hyperﬁne quenching rates for the 3P2 state were estimated more than four decades
ago by Garstang [13]. Our results are in a reasonable agreement with his values. Certainly,
our calculations based on the modern ab initio relativistic many-body techniques are more
complete. For instance, in the calculation of the sums SJ , Garstang [13] kept only the two

lowest-energy intermediate states 3P1 and 1P1. This author has also employed the following
E1-matrix elements |h1S0||D||3P1i| = 0.0058 a.u. and |h1S0||D||1P1i| = 3.46 a.u., which
are smaller than more accurate values [17] of 0.0064(7) a.u. and 4.03(2) a.u., employed
here. Our results for 87Sr are in fair agreement with the estimate of Ref. [7]. Previously,
we have estimated the quenching rates for Yb isotopes [10] by summing only over the two
lowest-energy excited states; the present result should be considered as more accurate.

In Table V the calculated hyperﬁne quenching rates (maximum over hyperﬁne manifold)
for the 3P2 states are compared with the conventional electromagnetic transition rates. For
Mg, Ca, and Sr these rates were calculated in Ref. [12] and are due to M1, M2, E2, and
E3 multipole transitions. If the hyperﬁne quenching is allowed for a particular value of F ,
both rates contribute at a comparable level for Mg. For Ca and heavier atoms the hyperﬁne
quenching becomes the dominant decay branch and determines the lifetime of the fermionic
isotopes.

It is worth mentioning that Yasuda and Katori [29] have experimentally demonstrated
that the blackbody radiation at 300 K quenches the 3PJ metastable states of Sr, signiﬁcantly
shortening their lifetimes. We veriﬁed that for other atoms, Mg, Ca, and Yb at T < 300
K the blackbody radiation does not aﬀect the lifetimes of the 3PJ states. We would like to
emphasize, that the results tabulated in this paper are for the radiative decay rates due to
the vacuum ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, i.e., for the ambient temperature of
T = 0. The additional quenching by the temperature-dependent blackbody radiation [29]
should be also included in the total rate, especially for Sr isotopes.

To summarize, here we employed the relativistic many-body methods to evaluate the
hyperﬁne quenching rates for the metastable 3P0 and 3P2 states of Mg, Ca, Sr, and Yb. The
tabulated rates may be useful for designing novel ultra-precise optical clocks and trapping

ing natural widths of the 3P0 −1S0 clock transition are 0.44 mHz for 25Mg, 2.2 mHz for 43Ca,

isotopes, the lifetime of the 3P2 states in fermionic isotopes is noticeably shortened by the
hyperﬁne quenching but still remains long enough for trapping experiments.
